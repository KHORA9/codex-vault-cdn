I wish here to explain that the\r\nomission arose from the subject being too great in its extent, and too\r\nspecial in its nature, to allow of the completion at that time, of any\r\nsatisfactory investigation in relation to it even if it had not then\r\nbeen under examination by a Committee of the House of Commons, whose\r\nReport is now before the public.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo obtain the information on which the following report is founded, I\r\nhave consulted, as extensively as the time allowed and my opportunities\r\nwould permit, ministers of religion who are called upon to perform\r\nfunereal rites in the poorer districts: I have made inquiries of persons\r\nof the labouring classes, and of secretaries and officers of benefit\r\nsocieties and burial clubs, in the metropolis and in several provincial\r\ntowns in the United Kingdom, on the practice of interments in relation\r\nto those classes, and on the alterations and improvements that would be\r\nmost in accordance with their feelings: I have questioned persons\r\nfollowing the occupation of undertaker, and more especially those who\r\nare chiefly engaged in the interment of the dead of the labouring\r\nclasses, on the improvements which they deem practicable in the modes of\r\nperforming that service: I have consulted foreigners resident in the\r\nmetropolis, on the various modes of interment in their own countries: I\r\nhave examined the chief administrative regulations thereon in Germany,\r\nFrance, and the United States: and I have consulted several eminent\r\nphysiologists as to the effects produced on the health of the living, by\r\nemanations from human remains in a state of decomposition. I need\r\nscarcely premise that the moral as well as the physical facts developed\r\nin the course of this inquiry are often exceedingly loathsome; but\r\ngeneral conclusions can only be distinctly made out from the various\r\nclasses of particular facts, and the object being the suggestion of\r\nremedies and preventives, it were obviously as unbecoming to yield to\r\ndisgusts or to evade the examination and calm consideration of those\r\nfacts, as it would be in the physician or the surgeon, in the\r\nperformance of his duty with the like object, to shrink from the\r\ninvestigation of the most offensive manifestations of disease.\r\n\r\n§ 1. It appears that the necessity of removing interments from the midst\r\nof towns is very generally admitted on various considerations,\r\nindependently of those founded on the presumed injurious effects arising\r\nfrom the practice to the public health. I believe an alteration of the\r\npractice is strongly desired by many clergymen of the established\r\nchurch, whose incomes, even with the probable compensation for the loss\r\nof burial dues, might be expected to be diminished by the discontinuance\r\nof _intra-mural_ interments. Exemptions from a general prohibition of\r\nsuch interments are, however, claimed in favour of particular\r\nburial-grounds, situate within populous districts, of which grounds it\r\nis stated that they are not over-crowded with bodies, and of which it is\r\nfurther alleged that they have not been known, and cannot be proved, to\r\nbe injurious to the public health.\r\n\r\nThe statements as to the innocuousness of particular graveyards are\r\nsupported by reference to the general testimony of a number of medical\r\nwitnesses of high professional position, by whom it is alleged that the\r\nemanations from decomposing human remains do not produce specific\r\ndisease, and, further, that they are not generally injurious. The\r\npractical consequences of these doctrines extend beyond the present\r\nquestion, and are so important in their effects on the sanitary economy\r\nof all towns, as apparently to require that no opportunity should be\r\nlost of examining the statements of facts on which they are founded.\r\n\r\nThe medical evidence of this class has generally been given in answer to\r\ncomplaints made by the public, of the offensiveness, and the danger to\r\nhealth which arises from the practice of dissection in schools of\r\nanatomy amidst crowded populations. The chief fact alleged to prove the\r\ninnocuousness of emanations from the dead is that professors of anatomy\r\nexperience no injury from them. Thus, Dr. Warren, of Boston, in a paper\r\ncited by M. Parent Duchâtelet, states, that he has been accustomed all\r\nhis life to dissecting-rooms, in which he has been engaged night and\r\nday. “It has sometimes happened to me,” he observes, “after having\r\ndissected bodies in a state of putrefaction, to have experienced a sort\r\nof weakness and the loss of appetite; but the phenomena were never\r\notherwise than transient. During the year 1829, the weather being\r\nexcessively hot, decomposition advanced with a degree of rapidity such\r\nas I have rarely witnessed: at that season the emanations became so\r\nirritating, that they paralyzed the hands, producing small pustules and\r\nan excessive itching, and yet my general health was in nowise affected.”\r\n\r\nAgain, whilst it is stated by M. Duchâtelet that students who attend the\r\ndissecting-rooms are sometimes seriously injured, and even killed by\r\npricks and cuts with the instruments of dissection, yet it is denied\r\nthat they are subject to any illness from the emanations from the\r\nremains “other than a nausea and a dysentery for two or three days at\r\nthe commencement of their studies.” Fevers the students of medicine are\r\nconfessedly liable to, but he says it is only when they are in\r\nattendance on the living patients in the fever wards.\r\n\r\nSir Benjamin Brodie pointed out to me, that from the precautions taken,\r\nby the removal of such portions of the viscera as might be in an\r\nadvanced state of decomposition, and from the ventilation of\r\ndissecting-rooms being much improved, the emanations from the bodies\r\ndissected are not so great as might be supposed; nevertheless, he\r\nobserves:—\r\n\r\n  There is no doubt that there are few persons who during the\r\n  anatomical season are engaged for many hours daily in a\r\n  dissecting-room for a considerable time, whose health is not\r\n  affected in a greater or less degree; and there are some whose\r\n  health suffers considerably. I have known several young men who have\r\n  not been able to prosecute their studies in the dissecting-room for\r\n  more than three or four weeks at a time, without being compelled to\r\n  leave them and go into the country. The great majority, however, do\r\n  not suffer to that extent, nor in such a way as to cause\r\n  interruption to their studies; and, altogether, the evil is not on a\r\n  sufficiently large scale to attract much notice, even among the\r\n  students themselves.\r\n\r\nA writer on public health, Dr. Dunglison, maintains that “we have no\r\nsatisfactory proof that malaria ever arises from animal putrefaction\r\nsingly;” and as evidence of this position he adduces the alleged fact of\r\nthe numbers of students who pass through their education without injury;\r\nyet he admits—\r\n\r\n  In stating the opinion that putrefaction singly does not occasion\r\n  malarious disease, we do not mean to affirm that air highly charged\r\n  with putrid miasmata may not, in some cases, powerfully impress the\r\n  nervous system so as to induce syncope and high nervous disorder; or\r\n  that, when such miasmata are absorbed by the lungs in a concentrated\r\n  state, they may not excite putrid disorders, or dispose the frame to\r\n  unhealthy erysipelatous affections. On the contrary, experiment\r\n  seems to have shown that they are deleterious when injected; and\r\n  cases are detailed in which, when exhaled from the dead body, they\r\n  have excited serious mischief in those exposed to their action.\r\n  According to Percy, a Dr. Chambon was required by the Dean of the\r\n  Faculté de Médecine of Paris to demonstrate the liver and its\r\n  appendages before the faculty on applying for his licence. The\r\n  decomposition of the subject given him for the demonstration was so\r\n  far advanced, that Chambon drew the attention of the Dean to it, but\r\n  he was required to go on. One of the four candidates, Corion, struck\r\n  by the putrid emanations which escaped from the body as soon as it\r\n  was opened, fainted, was carried home, and died in seventy hours;\r\n  another, the celebrated Fourcroy, was attacked with a burning\r\n  exanthematous eruption; and two others, Laguerenne and Dufresnoy,\r\n  remained a long time feeble, and the latter never completely\r\n  recovered. “As for Chambon,” says M. Londe, “indignant at the\r\n  obstinacy of the Dean, he remained firm in his place, finished his\r\n  lecture in the midst of the Commissioners, who inundated their\r\n  handkerchiefs with essences, and, doubtless, owed his safety to his\r\n  cerebral excitement, which during the night, after a slight febrile\r\n  attack, gave occasion to a profuse cutaneous exhalation.”\r\n\r\nAn eminent surgeon, who expressed to me his belief that no injury\r\nresulted from emanations from decomposing remains, for he had suffered\r\nnone, mentioned an instance where he had conducted the post mortem\r\nexamination of the corpse of a person of celebrity which was in a\r\ndreadful state of decomposition, without sustaining any injury; yet he\r\nadmitted, as a casual incident which did not strike him as militating\r\nagainst the conclusion, that his assistant was immediately after taken\r\nill, and had an exanthematous eruption, and had been compelled to go to\r\nthe sea side, but had not yet recovered. Another surgeon who had lived\r\nfor many years near a churchyard in the metropolis, and had never\r\nobserved any effluvia from it, neither did _he_ perceive any effects of\r\nsuch emanations at church or anywhere else; yet he admitted that his\r\nwife perceived the openings of vaults when she went to the church to\r\nwhich the graveyard belonged, and after respiring the air there, would\r\nsay, “they have opened a vault,” and on inquiry, the fact proved to be\r\nso. He admitted also, that formerly in the school of anatomy which he\r\nattended, pupils were sometimes attacked with fever, which was called\r\n“the dissecting-room fever,” which, since better regulations were\r\nadopted, was now unknown.\r\n\r\n§ 2. In proof of the position that the emanations from decomposing\r\nremains are not injurious to health at any time, reference is commonly\r\nmade to the statements in the papers of Parent Duchâtelet, wherein he\r\ncites instances of the exhumation of bodies in an advanced stage of\r\ndecomposition without any injurious consequences being experienced by\r\nthe persons engaged in conducting them.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this inquiry, and whilst engaged in the preparation\r\nof the report, I was favoured by Dr. Forbes with the copy of a report by\r\nDr. V. A. Riecke, of Stuttgart. “On the Influence of Putrefactive\r\nEmanations on the Health of Man,” &c., in which the medical evidence of\r\nthis class is closely investigated. In reference to the statements of\r\nParent Duchâtelet on this question, Dr. Riecke observes—\r\n\r\n  When Parent Duchâtelet appeals to and gives such prominence to the\r\n  instance of the disinterments from the churchyard of St. Innocens,\r\n  and states that they took place without any injurious consequences,\r\n  although at last all precautions in the mode of disinterring were\r\n  thrown aside, and that it occurred during the hottest season of the\r\n  year, and therefore that the putrid emanations might be believed to\r\n  be in their most powerful and injurious state, I would reply to this\r\n  by asking the simple question, what occasion was there for the\r\n  disinterment? Parent Duchâtelet maintains complete silence on this\r\n  point; but to me the following notices appear worthy of attention.\r\n  In the year 1554, Houlier and Fernel, and in the year 1738, Lemery,\r\n  Geoffroy, and Hunaud, raised many complaints of this churchyard; and\r\n  the two first had asserted that, during the plague, the disease had\r\n  lingered longest in the neighbourhood of the Cimetière de la\r\n  Trinité, and that there the greatest number had fallen a sacrifice.\r\n  In the years 1737 and 1746 the inhabitants of the houses round the\r\n  churchyard of St. Innocens complained loudly of the revolting stench\r\n  to which they were exposed. In the year 1755 the matter again came\r\n  into notice: the inspector who was intrusted with the inquiry,\r\n  himself saw the vapour rising from a large common grave, and\r\n  convinced himself of the injurious effects of this vapour on the\r\n  inhabitants of the neighbouring house.[1] “Often,” says the author\r\n  of a paper which we have before often alluded to, “the complexions\r\n  of the young people who remain in this neighbourhood grow pale. Meat\r\n  sooner becomes putrid there than elsewhere, and many persons cannot\r\n  get accustomed to these houses.” In the year 1779, in a cemetery\r\n  which yearly received from 2000 to 3000 corpses, they dug an immense\r\n  common grave near to that part of the cemetery which touches upon\r\n  the Rue de la Lingerie. The grave was 50 feet deep, and made to\r\n  receive from 1500 to 1600 bodies. But in February, 1780, the whole\r\n  of the cellars in the street were no longer fit to use. Candles were\r\n  extinguished by the air in these cellars; and those who only\r\n  approached the apertures were immediately seized with the most\r\n  alarming attacks. The evil was only diminished on the bodies being\r\n  covered with half a foot of lime, and all further interments\r\n  forbidden. But even that must have been found insufficient, as,\r\n  after some years, the great work of disinterring the bodies from\r\n  this churchyard was determined upon. This undertaking, according to\r\n  Thouret’s report, was carried on from December, 1785, to May, 1786;\r\n  from December, 1786, to February, 1787; and in August and October of\r\n  the same year: and it is not unimportant to quote this passage, as\r\n  it clearly shows how little correct Parent Duchâtelet was in his\r\n  general statement, that those disinterments took place in the\r\n  hottest seasons of the year. It is very clear that it was exactly\r\n  the coldest seasons of the year which were chosen for the work; and\r\n  though in the year 1787 there occurs the exception of the work\r\n  having been again begun in August, I think it may be assumed that\r\n  the weather of this month was unusually cold, and it was therefore\r\n  thought the work might be carried on without injurious effects. It\r\n  does not, however, appear to have been considered safe to continue\r\n  the work at that season, since the report goes on to state that the\r\n  operations were again discontinued in September.\r\n\r\n  Against those statements of Parent Duchâtelet, as to the\r\n  innocuousness of the frequent disinterments in Père La Chaise,\r\n  statements which are supported by the testimony of Orfila and\r\n  Ollivier, in regard to their experience of disinterments, I would\r\n  here place positive facts, which are not to be rejected. “I,” also\r\n  remarks Duvergie, “have undertaken judicial disinterments, and must\r\n  declare that, during one of these disinterments at which M.\r\n  Piedagnel was present with me, we were attacked with an illness,\r\n  although it was conducted under the shade of a tent, through which\r\n  there was passing a strong current of wind, and although we used\r\n  chloride of lime in abundance, M. Piedagnel was confined to his room\r\n  for six weeks.” Apparently, Duvergie is not far wrong when he states\r\n  his opinion that Orfila had allowed himself to be misled by his\r\n  praiseworthy zeal for the more general recognition of the use of\r\n  disinterments for judicial purposes, to understate the dangers\r\n  attending them, as doubtless he had used all the precautions during\r\n  the disinterments which such researches demand: and to these\r\n  precautions (which Orfila himself recommended) may be attributed the\r\n  few injurious effects of these disinterments. It, however, deserves\r\n  mentioning, that, if Orfila did undertake disinterments during the\r\n  heat of summer, it must have been only very rarely; at least,\r\n  amongst the numerous special cases which he gives, we find only two\r\n  which took place in July or August, most of the cases occurred in\r\n  the coldest season of the year. I cannot refrain from giving, also,\r\n  the information which Fourcroy gained from the grave-diggers of the\r\n  churchyard of St. Innocens. Generally they did not seem to rate the\r\n  danger of displacing the corpses very high: they remarked, however,\r\n  that some days after the disinterment of the corpses the abdomen\r\n  would swell, owing to the great development of gas; and that if an\r\n  opening forced itself at the navel, or anywhere in the region of the\r\n  belly, there issued forth the most horribly smelling liquid and a\r\n  mephitic gas; and of the latter they had the greatest fear, as it\r\n  produced sudden insensibility and faintings. Fourcroy wished much to\r\n  make further researches into the nature of this gas, but he could\r\n  not find any grave-digger who could be induced by an offered reward\r\n  to assist him by finding a body which was in a fit state to produce\r\n  the gas. They stated, that, at a certain distance, this gas only\r\n  produced a slight giddiness, a feeling of nausea, languor, and\r\n  debility. These attacks lasted several hours, and were followed by\r\n  loss of appetite, weakness, and trembling. “Is it not very\r\n  probable,” says Fourcroy, “that a poison so terrible that when in a\r\n  concentrated state, it produced sudden death, should, even when\r\n  diluted and diffused through the atmosphere, still possess a power\r\n  sufficient to produce depression of the nervous energy and an entire\r\n  disorder of their functions? Let any one witness the terror of these\r\n  grave-diggers, and also see the cadaverous appearance of the\r\n  greatest number, and all the other signs of the influence of a slow\r\n  poison, and they will no longer doubt of the dangerous effects of\r\n  the air from churchyards on the inmates of neighbouring houses.”\r\n\r\nAfter having strenuously asserted the general innocuousness of such\r\nemanations, and the absence of foundation for the complaints against the\r\nanatomical schools, Parent Duchâtelet concludes by an admission of their\r\noffensiveness, and a recommendation in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n  “Instead of retaining the ‘debris’ of dissection near the theatres\r\n  of anatomy, it would certainly be better to remove them every day:\r\n  but as that is often impracticable, there ought, on a good system of\r\n  ‘assainissement,’ to be considered the mode of retaining them\r\n  without incurring the risk of suffering from their infection.”\r\n\r\nAfter describing the mode of removing the “debris,” he concludes—\r\n\r\n  “Thus will this part of the work be freed from the inconveniences\r\n  which accompanied and formed one of the widest sources of\r\n  ‘infection,’ and of the disgust which were complained of in the\r\n  theatres of anatomy.”\r\n\r\n§ 3. The statements of M. Duchâtelet respecting the innocuousness of\r\nemanations from decomposing animal and vegetable remains, observed by\r\nhim at the _chantiers d’équarrissage_, or receptacle for dead horses,\r\nand the _dépôts de vidange_, or receptacle of night soil, &c., at\r\nMontfaucon, near Paris, are cited in this country, and on the continent,\r\nas leading evidence to sustain the general doctrine; but as it is with\r\nhis statements of the direct effects of the emanations from the\r\ngrave-yards, so it is with relation to his statements as to the effects\r\nof similar emanations on the health of the population; the facts appear\r\nto have been imperfectly observed by him even in his own field of\r\nobservation. In the Medical Review, conducted by Dr. Forbes, reference\r\nis made to the accounts given by Caillard of the epidemic which occurred\r\nin the vicinity of the Canal de l'Ourcq near Paris in 1810 and\r\nsubsequent years:—\r\n\r\n  In the route from Paris to Pantin (says he), exposed on the one side\r\n  to the miasmatic emanations of the canal, and on the other, to the\r\n  putrid effluvia of the _voiries_, the diseases were numerous, almost\r\n  all serious and obstinate. This disastrous effect of the union of\r\n  putrid effluvia with marsh miasmata, was especially evident in one\r\n  part of this route, termed the Petit Pont hamlet, inhabited by a\r\n  currier and a gut-spinner, the putrid waters from whose operations\r\n  are prevented from escaping by the banks of the canal, and exposed\r\n  before the draining to the emanations of a large marsh. This hamlet\r\n  was so unhealthy, that of five-and-twenty or thirty inhabitants I\r\n  visited about twenty were seriously affected, of whom five died.\r\n\r\nIn the carefully prepared report on the progress of cholera at Paris,\r\nmade by the commission of medical men, of which Parent Duchâtelet was a\r\nmember, it is mentioned, as a singular incident, that in those places\r\nwhere putrid emanations prevailed, “le cholera ne s'est montré ni plus\r\nredoutable ni plus meurtrier que dans autres localities.” Yet the\r\ntestimony cited as to this point is that of the Maire, “whose zeal\r\nequalled his intelligence,” and he alleges the occurrence of the fact of\r\nthe liability to fevers which M. Duchâtelet elsewhere denies.\r\n\r\n  “I have also made some observations which seem to destroy the\r\n  opinions received at this time, as to the sanitary effect of these\r\n  kinds of receptacles; for,\r\n\r\n  “1st. The inhabitants of the houses situated the nearest to the\r\n  depôt, and which are sometimes _tormented_ with fevers, have never\r\n  felt any indisposition.”\r\n\r\n§ 4. To prove the innocuousness of emanations from human remains on the\r\ngeneral health, evidence of another class is adduced, consisting of\r\ninstances of persons acting as keepers of dissecting rooms, and\r\ngrave-diggers, and the undertakers’ men, who it is stated have pursued\r\ntheir occupations for long periods, and have nevertheless maintained\r\nrobust health.\r\n\r\nThe examination of persons engaged in processes exposed to miasma from\r\ndecomposing animal remains in general only shows that habit combined\r\nwith associations of profit often prevents or blunts the perceptions of\r\nthe most offensive remains. Men with shrunken figures, and the\r\nappearance of premature age, and a peculiar cadaverous aspect, have\r\nattended as witnesses to attest their own perfectly sound condition, as\r\nevidence of the salubrity of their particular occupations. Generally,\r\nhowever, men with robust figures and the hue of health are singled out\r\nand presented as examples of the general innocuousness of the offensive\r\nmiasma generated in the process in which they are engaged. Professor\r\nOwen mentions an instance of a witness of this class, a very robust man,\r\nthe keeper of a dissecting room, who appeared to be in florid health\r\n(which however proved not to be so sound as he himself conceived), who\r\nprofessed perfect unconsciousness of having sustained any injury from\r\nthe occupation, and there was no reason to doubt that he really was\r\nunconscious of having sustained or observed any; but it turned out, on\r\ninquiry, that he had always had the most offensive and dangerous work\r\ndone by an inferior assistant; and that within his time he had had no\r\nless than eight assistants, and that every one had died, and some of\r\nthese had been dissected in the theatre where they had served. So,\r\nfrequently, the sextons of grave-yards, who are robust men, attest the\r\nsalubrity of the place; but on examining the inferiors, the\r\ngrave-diggers, it appears, where there is much to do, and even in some\r\nof the new cemeteries, that as a class they are unhealthy and\r\ncadaverous, and, notwithstanding precautions, often suffer severely on\r\nre-opening graves, and that their lives are frequently cut short by the\r\nwork.[2] There are very florid and robust undertakers; but, as a class,\r\nand with all the precautions they use, they are unhealthy; and a master\r\nundertaker, of considerable business in the metropolis, states, that “in\r\nnine cases out of ten the undertaker who has much to do with the corpse\r\nis a person of cadaverous hue, and you may almost always tell him\r\nwhenever you see him.” Fellmongers, tanners, or the workmen employed in\r\nthe preparation of hides, have been instanced by several medical writers\r\nas a class who, being exposed to emanations from the skins when in a\r\nstate of putrefaction, enjoy good health; but it appears that all the\r\nworkmen are not engaged in the process when the skins are in that state,\r\nand that those of them who are, as a class, do experience the common\r\nconsequences. The whole class of butchers, who are much in the open air\r\nand have very active exercise, and who are generally robust and have\r\nflorid health, are commonly mentioned as instances in proof of the\r\ninnocuousness of the emanations from the remains in slaughter-houses;\r\nbut master butchers admit that the men exclusively engaged in the\r\nslaughter-houses, in which perfect cleanliness and due ventilation are\r\nneglected, are of a cadaverous aspect, and suffer proportionately in\r\ntheir health.\r\n\r\nMedical papers have been written in this country and on the continent to\r\nshow that the exposure of workmen to putrid emanations in the employment\r\nof sewer cleansing has no effect on the general health; and when the\r\nemployers of the labourers engaged in such occupations are questioned on\r\nthe subject, their general reply is, that their men “have nothing the\r\nmatter with them:” yet when the _class_ of men who have been engaged in\r\nthe work during any length of time are assembled; when they are compared\r\nwith classes of men of the same age and country, and of the like periods\r\nof service in other employments free from such emanations, or still more\r\nwhen they are compared with men of the same age coming from the purer\r\natmosphere of a rural district, the fallacy is visible in the class, in\r\ntheir more pallid and shrunken aspect—the evidence of languid\r\ncirculation and reduced “tone,” and even of vitality—and there is then\r\nlittle doubt of the approximation given me by an engineer who has\r\nobserved different classes of workmen being correct, that employment\r\nunder such a mephitic influence as that in question ordinarily entails a\r\nloss of at least one-third of the natural duration of life and working\r\nability.\r\n\r\nThe usual comment of the employers on the admitted facts of the\r\nill-health and general brevity of life of the inferior workmen engaged\r\nin such occupations is, “But they drink—they are a drunken set;” and\r\nsuch appears frequently, yet by no means invariably, to be the case. On\r\nfurther examination it appears that the exposure to the emanations is\r\nproductive of nervous depression, which is constantly urged by the\r\nworkmen as necessitating the stimulus of spirituous or fermented\r\nliquors. The inference that the whole of the effects are ascribable to\r\nthe habitual indulgence in such stimuli is rebutted by the facts\r\nelicited on examination of other classes of workmen who indulge as much\r\nor more, but who nevertheless enjoy better health, and a much greater\r\naverage duration of life. It is apt to be overlooked that the weakly\r\nrarely engage in such occupations, or soon quit them; and that, in\r\ngeneral, the men are of the most robust classes, and have high wages and\r\nrather short hours of work, as well as stimulating food. A French\r\nphysician, M. Labarraque, states in respect to the tanners, that,\r\nnotwithstanding the constant exposure to the emanations from putrid\r\nfermentations, it has not been “remarked” of the workmen of this class\r\nthat they are more subject to illness than others. A tanner, in a manual\r\nwritten for the use of the trade, without admitting the correctness of\r\nthis statement, observes: “Whatever may be the opinion of M. Labarraque\r\non this point, we do not hesitate to declare the fact that this species\r\nof labour cannot be borne by weakly, scrofulous, or lymphatic\r\nsubjects.”[3]\r\n\r\n§ 5. So far as observations have been made on the point (and the more\r\nthose reported upon it are scrutinized, the less trustworthy they appear\r\nto be), workmen so exposed do not appear to be peculiarly subject to\r\nepidemics; many, indeed, appear to be exempted from them to such an\r\nextent as to raise a presumption that such emanations have on those\r\n“acclimated” to them an unexplained preservative effect analogous to\r\nvaccination. That one miasma may exclude, or neutralize, or modify the\r\ninfluence of another, would appear to be _primâ facie_ probable. But it\r\nis now becoming more extensively apparent that the same cause is\r\nproductive of very different effects on different persons, and on the\r\nsame persons at different times; as in the case mentioned by Dr. Arnott\r\nof the school badly drained at Clarendon Square, Somers’ Town, where\r\nevery year, while the nuisance was at its height, and until it was\r\nremoved by drainage, the malaria caused some remarkable form of disease;\r\none year, extraordinary nervous affection, exhibiting rigid spasms, and\r\nthen convulsions of the limbs, such as occur on taking various poisons\r\ninto the stomach; another year, typhoid fever; in another, ophthalmia;\r\nin another, extraordinary constipation of the bowels, affecting similar\r\nnumbers of the pupils. Such cases as the one before cited with respect\r\nto the depôt for animal matter in Paris, where the workmen suffered very\r\nlittle, whilst the people living near the depôt were “tormented with\r\nfevers,” are common. The effects of such miasma are manifested\r\nimmediately on all surrounding human life (and there is evidence to\r\nbelieve they are manifest in their degree on animal life[4]), in\r\nproportion to the relative strength of the destructive agents and the\r\nrelative strength or weakness of the beings exposed to them; the effects\r\nare seen first on infants; then on children in the order of their age\r\nand strength; then on females, or on the sickly, the aged, and feeble;\r\nlast of all, on the robust workmen, and on them it appears on those\r\nparts of the body that have been previously weakened by excess or by\r\nillness. Whilst M. Parent Duchâtelet was looking for immediate\r\nappearances of acute disease on the robust workmen living amidst the\r\ndecomposing animal effluvium of the Montfaucon, I have the authority of\r\nDr. Henry Bennett for stating that he might have found that the\r\ninfluence of that effluvium was observable on the sick at half a mile\r\ndistant. “When I was house surgeon at St. Louis,” says Dr. Bennett, “I\r\nseveral times remarked, that whenever the wind was from the direction of\r\nthe Montfaucon, the wounds and sores under my care assumed a foul\r\naspect. M. Jobert, the surgeon of the hospital, has told me that he has\r\nrepeatedly seen hospital gangrene manifest itself in the wards\r\napparently under the same influence. It is a fact known to all who are\r\nacquainted with St. Louis, that the above malady is more frequent at\r\nthat hospital than at any other in Paris, although it is the most airy\r\nand least crowded of any. This, I think, can only be attributed to the\r\nproximity of the Montfaucon. Indeed, when the wind blows from that\r\ndirection, which it often does for several months in the year, the\r\neffluvium is most odious.” As an instance of a similar influence of\r\nanother species of effluvium, not observed by the healthy inhabitants of\r\na district, it is stated that at a large infirmary in this country, when\r\nthe piece of ornamental water, which was formerly stagnant in front of\r\nthe edifice, had a greenish scum upon it, some descriptions of surgical\r\noperations were not so successful as at other times, and a flow of fresh\r\nwater has been introduced into the reservoir to prevent the miasma.\r\n\r\nThe immediate contrasts of the apparent immunity of adults to\r\nconspicuous attacks of epidemics, may perhaps account for the persuasion\r\nwhich masters and workmen sometimes express, that they owe an immunity\r\nfrom epidemics to their occupation, and that the stenches to which they\r\nare exposed actually “purify” the atmosphere. Numbers of such witnesses\r\nhave heretofore been ready to attest their conviction of the\r\npreservative effect, and even the positive advantages to health, of the\r\neffluvia generated by the decomposition of animal or of vegetable\r\nmatter, or of the fumes of minerals, of smoke, soot, and coal gas. But\r\nthough they do not peculiarly suffer from epidemics, it is usually found\r\nthat they are not exempted. In a recent return of the state of health of\r\nsome workmen engaged in cleansing sewers, whilst it appeared that very\r\nfew had suffered any attack from fever, nearly all suffered bowel\r\nattacks and violent intestinal derangement. If the effects of such\r\nemanations invariably appeared in the form of acute disease, large\r\nmasses of the population who have lived under their influence must have\r\nbeen exterminated. In general the poison appears only to be generated in\r\na sufficient degree of intensity to create acute disease under such a\r\nconjunction of circumstances, as a degree of moisture sufficient to\r\nfacilitate decomposition, a hot sun, a stagnant atmosphere, and a\r\nlanguid population. The injurious effects of diluted emanations are\r\nconstantly traceable, not in constitutional disturbance at any one time;\r\nthey have their effect even on the strong, perceptible over a space of\r\ntime in a general depression of health and a shortened period of\r\nexistence. This or that individual may have the florid hue of health,\r\nand may live under constant exposure to noxious influences to his\r\nsixtieth or his seventieth year; but had he not been so exposed he might\r\nhave lived in equal or greater vigour to his eightieth or his ninetieth\r\nyear. A cause common to a whole class is often, however, not manifest in\r\nparticular individuals, but is yet visible in the pallor and the reduced\r\nsum of vitality of the whole class, or in the average duration of life\r\nin that class, as compared with the average duration of life of another\r\nclass similarly situated, in all respects except in the exposure to that\r\none cause.[5] The effects of a cause of depression on a class are\r\nsometimes visible in the greater fatality of common accidents. An excess\r\nof mortality to a class is almost always found, on examination, to be\r\ntraceable to an adequate cause. From the external circumstances of a\r\nclass of the population, a confident expectation may be formed of the\r\nsum of vitality of the class, though nothing could be separately\r\npredicated of a single individual of it. If the former vulgar notions\r\nwere correct as to the salubrity of the stenches which prevail in towns,\r\nthe separate as well as the combined results of these several supposed\r\ncauses of salubrity must be to expel fevers and epidemics from the most\r\ncrowded manufacturing districts, and to advance the general health of\r\nthe inhabitants above that of the poorer rural population; but all such\r\nfallacies are dissipated by the dreadful facts on the face of the\r\nmortuary records showing a frequency of deaths, and a reduction of the\r\nmean duration of life, in proportion to the constancy and the intensity\r\nof the combined operation of these same causes.[6]\r\n\r\n§ 6. The observations of the effects of such emanations on the general\r\nhealth of classes of human beings have been corroborated by experiments\r\non animals.\r\n\r\n§ 7. Another doctrine more extensively entertained than that above\r\nnoticed, is, that although putrid emanations are productive of injury,\r\nthey are not productive of specific disease, such as typhus. The medical\r\nwitnesses say, that they were exposed to such emanations in\r\ndissecting-rooms, where bodies of persons who have died of small-pox,\r\ntyphus, scarlatina, and every species of disease, are brought; that they\r\npursued their studies in such places, and were unaware of typhus or\r\nother disease having been taken by the students in them, though that\r\ndisease was frequently caught by students whilst attending the living in\r\nthe fever wards.[7]\r\n\r\nThe strongest of this class of negative evidence appears to be that of\r\nundertakers, all of whom that I have seen state that neither specific\r\ndisease nor the propagation of any disease was known to occur amongst\r\nthem, from their employment. Neither the men who handle, or who\r\n“coffin,” the remains; nor the barbers who are called in to shave[8] the\r\ncorpses of the adult males; nor the bearers of the coffins, although,\r\nwhen the remains are in an advanced state of decomposition, the liquid\r\nmatter from the corpse frequently escapes from the coffin, and runs down\r\nover their clothes, are observed to catch any specific disease from it,\r\neither in their noviciate, or at any other time. When decomposition is\r\nvery far advanced, and the smell is very offensive, the men engaged in\r\nputting the corpse into the coffin smoke tobacco; and all have recourse\r\nto the stimulus of spirituous liquor. But it is not known that, by their\r\ninfected clothes they ever propagate specific disease in their families,\r\nor elsewhere. Neither does this appear to be observed amongst the\r\nmedical men themselves.[9]\r\n\r\n§ 8. On the other hand, the undertakers observe such instances, as will\r\nbe stated in their own words in a subsequent part of the report, where\r\nothers have caught fever and small-pox, apparently from the remains of\r\nthe dead, and they mention instances of persons coming from a distance\r\nto attend funerals, who have shortly afterwards become affected with the\r\ndisease of which the person buried had died. Of the undertakers it is\r\nobserved, that being adults, they were likely to have had small-pox. Dr.\r\nWilliams, in a work stated to be of good authority, on the effects of\r\nmorbid poisons, relates the case of four students infected with\r\nsmall-pox by the dead body of a man who had died of this disease, that\r\nwas brought into the Windmill-street Theatre, in London, for dissection.\r\nOne of them saw the body, but did not approach it; another was near it,\r\nbut did not touch it; a third, accustomed to make sketches from dead\r\nbodies, saw this subject, but did not touch it; the fourth alone touched\r\nit with both his hands; yet all the four caught the disease. Sir\r\nBenjamin Brodie mentions cases which occurred within his own knowledge,\r\nof pupils who caught small-pox after exposure to the emanations in the\r\ndissecting-room from the bodies of persons who had died of that disease.\r\n\r\nDr. Copeland, in his evidence before the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, adduced the following remarkable case, stated to be of fever\r\ncommunicated after death:—\r\n\r\n  About two years ago (says he) I was called, in the course of my\r\n  profession, to see a gentleman, advanced in life, well known to many\r\n  members in this house and intimately known to the Speaker. This\r\n  gentleman one Sunday went into a dissenting chapel, where the\r\n  principal part of the hearers, as they died, were buried in the\r\n  ground or vaults underneath. I was called to him on Tuesday evening,\r\n  and I found him labouring under symptoms of malignant fever; either\r\n  on that visit or the visit immediately following, on questioning him\r\n  on the circumstances which could have given rise to this very\r\n  malignant form of fever, for it was then so malignant that its fatal\r\n  issue was evident, he said that he had gone on the Sunday before\r\n  (this being on the Tuesday afternoon) to this dissenting chapel, and\r\n  on going up the steps to the chapel he felt a rush of foul air\r\n  issuing from the grated openings existing on each side of the steps;\r\n  the effect upon him was instantaneous; it produced a feeling of\r\n  sinking, with nausea, and so great debility, that he scarcely could\r\n  get into the chapel. He remained a short time, and finding this\r\n  feeling increase he went out, went home, was obliged to go to bed,\r\n  and there he remained. When I saw him he had, up to the time of my\r\n  ascertaining the origin of his complaint, slept with his wife; he\r\n  died eight days afterwards; his wife caught the disease and died in\r\n  eight days also, having experienced the same symptoms. These two\r\n  instances illustrated the form of fever arising from those\r\n  particular causes. Means of counteraction were used, and the fever\r\n  did not extend to any other members of the family.\r\n\r\n  Assuming that that individual had gone into a crowded hospital with\r\n  that fever, it probably would have become a contagious fever. The\r\n  disease would have propagated itself most likely to others, provided\r\n  those others exposed to the infection were predisposed to the\r\n  infection, or if the apartments where they were confined were not\r\n  fully ventilated, but in most cases where the emanations from the\r\n  sick are duly diluted by fresh air, they are rendered innocuous. It\r\n  is rarely that I have found the effects from dead animal matter so\r\n  very decisive as in this case, because in the usual circumstances of\r\n  burying in towns the fetid or foul air exhaled from the dead is\r\n  generally so diluted and scattered by the wind, as to produce only a\r\n  general ill effect upon those predisposed; it affects the health of\r\n  the community by lowering the vital powers, weakening the digestive\r\n  processes, but without producing any prominent or specific disease.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett, surgeon, one of the medical officers of the Stepney Union,\r\nwho has observed the symptoms observable in those persons who are\r\nexposed to the emanations from a crowded grave-yard, thus describes\r\nthem:—\r\n\r\n  They are characterized by more or less disturbance of the whole\r\n  system, with evident depression of the vital force, as evinced\r\n  throughout the vascular and nervous systems, by the feeble action of\r\n  the heart and arteries, and lowness of the spirits, &c. These\r\n  maladies, I doubt not, if surrounded by other causes, would\r\n  terminate in fever of the worst description. The cleanliness, &c.,\r\n  of the surrounding neighbourhood, perhaps, prevents this actually\r\n  taking place.\r\n\r\n  Some years since a vault was opened in the church-yard (Stepney),\r\n  and shortly after one of the coffins contained therein burst with so\r\n  loud a report that hundreds flocked to the place to ascertain the\r\n  cause. So intense was the poisonous nature of the effluvia arising\r\n  therefrom, that a great number were attacked with sudden sickness\r\n  and fainting, many of whom were a considerable period before they\r\n  recovered their health.\r\n\r\n  The vaults and burial ground attached to Brunswick chapel,\r\n  Limehouse, are much crowded with dead, and from the accounts of\r\n  individuals residing in the adjoining houses, it would appear that\r\n  the stench arising therefrom, particularly when a grave happens to\r\n  be opened during the summer months, is most noxious. In one case it\r\n  is described to have produced instant nausea and vomiting, and\r\n  attacks of illness are frequently imputed to it. Some say they have\r\n  never had a day’s good health since they have resided so near the\r\n  chapel-ground, which, I may remark, is about five feet above the\r\n  level of the surrounding yards, and very muddy—so much so, that\r\n  pumps are frequently used to expel the water from the vaults into\r\n  the streets.\r\n\r\nThe bursting of leaden coffins in the vaults of cemeteries, unless they\r\nare watched and “tapped” to allow the mephitic vapour to escape, appears\r\nto be not unfrequent. In cases of rapid decomposition, such instances\r\noccur in private houses before the entombment. An undertaker of\r\nconsiderable experience states:—\r\n\r\n  “I have known coffins to explode, like the report of a small gun, in\r\n  the house. I was once called up at midnight by the people, who were\r\n  in great alarm, and who stated that the coffin had burst in the\r\n  night, as they described it, with ‘a report like the report of a\r\n  cannon.’ On proceeding to the house I found in that case, which was\r\n  one of dropsy, very rapid decomposition had occurred, and the lead\r\n  was forced up. Two other cases have occurred within my experience of\r\n  coffins bursting in this manner. I have heard of similar cases from\r\n  other undertakers. The bursting of lead coffins without noise is\r\n  more frequent. Of course it is never told to the family unless they\r\n  have heard it, as they would attribute the bursting to some\r\n  defective construction of the coffins.”\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of cases of instant death to grave-diggers, from\r\naccidentally inhaling the concentrated miasma which escapes from\r\ncoffins, is undeniable. Slower deaths from exposure to such miasma are\r\ndesignated as “low fevers,” and whether or not the constitutional\r\ndisturbances attendant on the exposure to the influence of such miasma\r\nbe or not the true typhus, it suffices as a case requiring a remedy,\r\nthat the exposure to that influence is apt to produce grievous and fatal\r\ninjuries amongst the public.\r\n\r\n§ 9. Undertakers state that they sometimes experience, in particularly\r\ncrowded grave-yards, a sensation of faintness and nausea without\r\nperceiving any offensive smell. Dr. Riecke appears to conclude, from\r\nvarious instances which are given, that emanations from putrid remains\r\noperate in two ways,—one set of effects being produced through the lungs\r\nby impurity of the air from the mixture of irrespirable gases; the other\r\nset, through the olfactory nerves by powerful, penetrating, and\r\noffensive smells. On the whole, the evidence tends to establish the\r\ngeneral conclusion that offensive smells are true warnings of sanitary\r\nevils to the population. The fact of the general offensiveness of such\r\nemanations is adduced by Dr. Riecke also as evidence of their injurious\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n  Another circumstance which must awaken in us distrust of putrid\r\n  emanations, is the powerful impression they make on the sense of\r\n  smell. It certainly cannot be far from the truth to call the organ\r\n  of smell the truest sentinel of the human frame. “Many animals,”\r\n  observes Rudolphi, “are entirely dependent on their sense of smell\r\n  for finding out food that is not injurious; where their smell is\r\n  injured they are easily deceived, and have often fallen a sacrifice\r\n  to the consequent mistakes.” Amongst all known smells, there is,\r\n  perhaps, no one which is so universally, and to such a degree\r\n  revolting to man, as the smell of animal decomposition. The roughest\r\n  savage, as well as the most civilized European, fly with equal\r\n  disgust from a place where the air is infected by it. If an instinct\r\n  ever can be traced in man, certainly it is in the present case: and\r\n  is instinct a superfluous monitor exactly in this one case? Can\r\n  instinct mislead just in this one circumstance? Can it ever be, that\r\n  the air which fills us with the greatest disgust, is the finest\r\n  elixir of life, as Dumoulins had the boldness to maintain in one of\r\n  his official reports. Hippolyte Cloquet, in his Osphrestologie has\r\n  attempted to throw some light on the effect of smell on the human\r\n  frame, and though we must entirely disregard many of the anecdotes\r\n  which he has blended into his inquiry, yet the result remains firmly\r\n  proved that odours in general exert a very powerful influence on the\r\n  health of men, and that all very acutely impressing smells are\r\n  highly to be suspected of possessing injurious properties.\r\n\r\n§ 10. I beg leave on this particular topic to submit the facts and\r\nopinions contained in communications from two gentlemen who have paid\r\nclose and comprehensive attention to the subject.\r\n\r\nDr. Southwood Smith, who, as physician to the London Fever Hospital, and\r\nfrom having been engaged in several investigations as to the effects of\r\nputrid emanations on the public health, must have had extensive means of\r\nobservation, states as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. That the introduction of dead animal matter under certain\r\n  conditions into the living body is capable of producing disease, and\r\n  even death, is universally known and admitted. This morbific animal\r\n  matter may be the product either of secretion during life or of\r\n  decomposition after death. Familiar instances of morbific animal\r\n  matter, the result of secretion during life, are the poisons of\r\n  small-pox and cow-pox, and the vitiated fluids formed in certain\r\n  acute diseases, such as acute inflammations, and particularly of the\r\n  membranes that line the chest and abdomen. On the examination of the\r\n  body a short time after death from such inflammations, the fluids\r\n  are found so extremely acrid, that even when the skin is entirely\r\n  sound, they make the hands of the examiner smart; and if there\r\n  should happen to be the slightest scratch on the finger, or the\r\n  minutest point not covered by cuticle, violent inflammation is often\r\n  produced, ending, sometimes within forty-eight hours, in death. It\r\n  is remarkable, and it is a proof that in these cases the poison\r\n  absorbed is not putrid matter, that the most dangerous period for\r\n  the examination of the bodies of persons who die of such diseases is\r\n  from four to five hours after the fatal event, and while the body is\r\n  yet warm.\r\n\r\n  That the direct introduction into the system of decomposing and\r\n  putrescent animal matter is capable of producing fevers and\r\n  inflammations, the intensity and malignity of which may be varied at\r\n  will, according to the putrescency of the matter and the quantity of\r\n  it that is introduced, is proved by numerous experiments on animals;\r\n  while the instances in which human beings are seized with severe and\r\n  fatal affections from the application of the fluids of a dead animal\r\n  body to a wounded, punctured, or abraded surface, sometimes when the\r\n  aperture is so minute as to be invisible without the aid of a lens,\r\n  are of daily occurrence. Though this fact is now well known, and is\r\n  among the few that are disputed by no one, it may be worth while to\r\n  cite a few examples of it, as specimens of the manner in which the\r\n  poison of animal matter, when absorbed in this way, acts; a volume\r\n  might be filled with similar instances.\r\n\r\n  The following case is recorded by Sir Astley Cooper:—Mr. Elcock,\r\n  student of anatomy, slightly punctured his finger in opening the\r\n  body of a hospital patient about twelve o’clock at noon, and in the\r\n  evening of the same day, finding the wound painful, showed it to Sir\r\n  Astley Cooper after his surgical lecture. During the night the pain\r\n  increased to extremity, and symptoms of high constitutional\r\n  irritation presented themselves on the ensuing morning. No trace of\r\n  inflammation was apparent beyond a slight redness of the spot at\r\n  which the wound had been inflicted, which was a mere puncture. In\r\n  the evening he was visited by Dr. Babington, in conjunction with Dr.\r\n  Haighton and Sir Astley Cooper; still no local change was to be\r\n  discovered, but the nervous system was agitated in a most violent\r\n  and alarming degree, the symptoms nearly resembling the universal\r\n  excitation of hydrophobia, and in this state he expired within the\r\n  period of forty-eight hours from the injury.\r\n\r\n  The late Dr. Pett, of Hackney, being present at the examination of\r\n  the body of a lady who had died of peritoneal inflammation after her\r\n  confinement, handled the diseased parts. In the evening of the same\r\n  day, while at a party, he felt some pain in one of his fingers, on\r\n  which there was a slight blush, but no wound was visible at that\r\n  time. The pain increasing, the finger was examined in a stronger\r\n  light, when, by the aid of a lens, a minute opening in the cuticle\r\n  was observed. During the night the pain increased to agony, and in\r\n  the morning his appearance was extremely altered; his countenance\r\n  was suffused with redness, his eyes were hollow and ferrety; there\r\n  was a peculiarity in his breathing, which never left him during his\r\n  illness; his manner, usually gay and playful, was now torpid, like\r\n  that of a person who had taken an excessive dose of opium, he\r\n  described himself as having suffered intensely, and said that he was\r\n  completely knocked down and had not the strength of a child, and he\r\n  sunk exhausted on the fifth day from the examination of the body.\r\n\r\n  George Higinbottom, an undertaker, was employed to remove in a shell\r\n  the corpse of a woman who had died of typhus fever in the London\r\n  Fever Hospital. In conveying the body from the shell into the\r\n  coffin, he observed that his left hand was besmeared with a moisture\r\n  which had oozed from it. He had a recent scratch on his thumb. The\r\n  following morning this scratch was inflamed; in the evening of the\r\n  same day he was attacked with a cold shivering and pain in his head\r\n  and limbs, followed the next by other symptoms of severe fever; on\r\n  the fourth day there was soreness in the top of the shoulder and\r\n  fulness in the axilla; on the fifth the breast became swollen and\r\n  efflorescent; on the seventh delirium supervened, succeeded by\r\n  extreme prostration and coma, and death took place on the tenth day.\r\n\r\n  A lady in the country received a basket of fish from London which\r\n  had become putrid on the road. In opening the basket she pricked her\r\n  finger, and she slightly handled the fish. On the evening of this\r\n  day inflammation came on in the finger, followed by such severe\r\n  constitutional symptoms as to endanger life, and it was six months\r\n  before the effects of this wound subsided and her health was\r\n  restored.\r\n\r\n  Among many other cases, Mr. Travers gives the following, as\r\n  displaying well the minor degrees of irritation, local and\r\n  constitutional, to which cooks and others, in handling putrid animal\r\n  matter with chapped and scratched fingers, are exposed:—A cook-maid\r\n  practised herself on a stale hare, for the purpose of learning the\r\n  mode of boning them, in spite of being strongly cautioned against\r\n  it. A few days afterwards two slight scratches, which she remembered\r\n  to have received at the time, began to inflame; one was situated on\r\n  the fore-finger and the other on the ring-finger. This inflammation\r\n  was accompanied with a dull pain and feeling of numbness, and an\r\n  occasional darting pain along the inside of the fore-arm. The next\r\n  day she was attacked with excruciating pain at the point of the\r\n  fore-finger, which throbbed so violently as to give her the\r\n  sensation of its being about to burst at every pulsation. The\r\n  following morning constitutional symptoms came on; her tongue was\r\n  white and dry; she had no appetite; there was great dejection of\r\n  spirits and languor, and a weak and unsteady pulse. After suffering\r\n  greatly from severe pain in the finger, hand, and arm, and great\r\n  constitutional derangement and debility, the local inflammation\r\n  disappeared in about three weeks, and she then began to recover her\r\n  appetite and strength.\r\n\r\n  2. It is proved by indubitable evidence that this morbific matter is\r\n  as capable of entering the system when minute particles of it are\r\n  diffused in the atmosphere as when it is directly introduced into\r\n  the blood-vessels by a wound. When diffused in the air, these\r\n  noxious particles are conveyed into the system through the thin and\r\n  delicate walls of the air vesicles of the lungs in the act of\r\n  respiration. The mode in which the air vesicles are formed and\r\n  disposed is such as to give to the human lungs an almost incredible\r\n  extent of absorbing surface, while at every point of this surface\r\n  there is a vascular tube ready to receive any substance imbibed by\r\n  it and to carry it at once into the current of the circulation.\r\n  Hence the instantaneousness and the dreadful energy with which\r\n  certain poisons act upon the system when brought into contact with\r\n  the pulmonary surface. A single inspiration of the concentrated\r\n  prussic acid, for example, is capable of killing with the rapidity\r\n  of a stroke of lightning. So rapidly does this poison affect the\r\n  system, and so deadly is its nature, that more than one physiologist\r\n  has lost his life by incautiously inhaling it while using it for the\r\n  purpose of experiment. If the nose of an animal be slowly passed\r\n  over a bottle containing this poison, and the animal happen to\r\n  inspire during the moment of the passage, it drops down dead\r\n  instantaneously, just as when the poison is applied in the form of a\r\n  liquid to the tongue or the stomach. On the other hand, the vapour\r\n  of chlorine possesses the property of arresting the poisonous\r\n  effects of prussic acid; and hence when an animal is all but dead\r\n  from the effects of this acid, it is sometimes suddenly restored to\r\n  life by holding its mouth over the vapour of chlorine.\r\n\r\n  During every moment of life in natural respiration a portion of the\r\n  air of the atmosphere passes through the air vesicles of the lungs\r\n  into the blood, while a quantity of carbonic acid gas is given off\r\n  from the blood, and is transmitted through the walls of these\r\n  vesicles into the atmosphere. Now that substances mixed with or\r\n  suspended in atmospheric air may be conveyed with it to the lungs\r\n  and immediately enter into the circulating mass, any one may satisfy\r\n  himself merely by passing through a recently painted chamber. The\r\n  vapour of turpentine diffused through the chamber is transmitted to\r\n  the lungs with the air which is breathed, and passing into the\r\n  current of the circulation through the walls of the air vesicles,\r\n  exhibits its effects in some of the fluid excretions of the body,\r\n  even more rapidly than if it had been taken into the stomach.\r\n\r\n  Facts such as these help us to understand the production and\r\n  propagation of disease through the medium of an infected atmosphere,\r\n  whether on a large scale, as in the case of an epidemic which\r\n  rapidly extends over a nation or a continent, or on a small scale,\r\n  in the sick chamber, the dissecting room, the church, and the\r\n  church-yard.\r\n\r\n  Thus it is universally known that, when the atmosphere is infected\r\n  with the matter of small-pox, this disease is produced with the same\r\n  and even with greater certainty than when the matter of small-pox is\r\n  introduced by the lancet directly into a blood-vessel in\r\n  inoculation.\r\n\r\n  It is equally well known that, when the air is infected by particles\r\n  of decomposing vegetable and animal matter, fevers are produced of\r\n  various types and different degrees of intensity; that the\r\n  exhalations arising from marshes, bogs, and other uncultivated and\r\n  undrained places, constitute a poison chiefly of a vegetable nature,\r\n  which produces principally fevers of an intermittent or remittent\r\n  type; and that exhalations accumulated in close, ill-ventilated, and\r\n  crowded apartments in the confined situations of densely-populated\r\n  cities, where little attention is paid to the removal of putrefying\r\n  and excrementitious matters, constitute a poison chiefly of an\r\n  animal nature, which produces continued fever of the typhoid\r\n  character. There are situations in which these putrefying matters,\r\n  aided by heat and other peculiarities of climate, generate a poison\r\n  so intense and deadly, that a single inspiration of the air in which\r\n  they are diffused is capable of producing almost instantaneous\r\n  death; and there are other situations in which a less highly\r\n  concentrated poison accumulates, the inspiration of which for a few\r\n  minutes produces a fever capable of destroying life in from two to\r\n  twelve hours. In dirty and neglected ships, in damp, crowded, and\r\n  filthy gaols, in the crowded wards of ill-ventilated hospitals\r\n  filled with persons labouring under malignant surgical diseases or\r\n  bad forms of fever, an atmosphere is generated which cannot be\r\n  breathed long, even by the most healthy and robust, without\r\n  producing highly dangerous fever.\r\n\r\n  3. The evidence is just as indubitable that exhalations arise from\r\n  the bodies of the dead, which are capable of producing disease and\r\n  death. Many instances are recorded of the communication of small-pox\r\n  from the corpse of a person who has died of small-pox. This has\r\n  happened not only in the dwelling-house before interment, but even\r\n  in the dissecting room. Some years ago five students of anatomy, at\r\n  the Webb-street school, Southwark, who were pursuing their studies\r\n  under Mr. Grainger, were seized with small-pox, communicated from a\r\n  subject on the dissecting-table, though it does not appear that all\r\n  who were attacked were actually engaged in dissecting this body. One\r\n  of these young men died. There is reason to believe that emanations\r\n  from the bodies of persons who have died of other forms of fever\r\n  have proved injurious and even fatal to individuals who have been\r\n  much in the same room with the corpse.\r\n\r\n  The exhalations arising from dead bodies in the dissecting room are\r\n  in general so much diluted by admixture with atmospheric air,\r\n  through the ventilation which is kept up, that they do not commonly\r\n  affect the health in a very striking or marked manner; and by great\r\n  attention to ventilation, it is no doubt possible to pursue the\r\n  study of anatomy with tolerable impunity. Yet few teachers of\r\n  anatomy deny that without this precaution this pursuit is very apt\r\n  to injure the health, and that, with all the precaution that can be\r\n  taken, it sometimes produces such a degree of diarrhœa, and at other\r\n  times such a general derangement of the digestive organs, as\r\n  imperatively to require an absence for a time from the dissecting\r\n  room and a residence in the pure air of the country. The same\r\n  statements are uniformly made by the professors of Veterinary\r\n  anatomy in this country. The result of inquiries which I have\r\n  personally made into the state of the health of persons licensed to\r\n  slaughter horses, called knackers, is, that though they maintain\r\n  their health apparently unimpaired for some time, yet that after a\r\n  time the functions of the nutritive organs become impaired, they\r\n  begin to emaciate, and present a cadaverous appearance, slight\r\n  wounds fester and become difficult to heal, and that upon the whole\r\n  they are a short-lived race.\r\n\r\n  The exhalations arising from dead bodies interred in the vaults of\r\n  churches, and in church-yards, are also so much diluted with the air\r\n  of the atmosphere, that they do not commonly affect the health in so\r\n  immediate and direct a manner as plainly to indicate the source of\r\n  these noxious influences. It is only when some accidental\r\n  circumstances have favoured their accumulation or concentration in\r\n  an unusual degree, that the effects become so sensible as obviously\r\n  to declare their cause. Every now and then, however, such a\r\n  concurrence of circumstances does happen, of which there are many\r\n  instances on record; but it may suffice for the present to mention\r\n  one, the particulars of which I have received from a gentleman who\r\n  is known to me, and on the accuracy of whose statements I can rely.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Hutchinson, surgeon, Farringdon-street, was called on Monday\r\n  morning, the 15th March, 1841, to attend a girl, aged 14, who was\r\n  labouring under typhus fever of a highly malignant character. This\r\n  girl was the daughter of a pew-opener in one of the large city\r\n  churches, situated in the centre of a small burial ground, which had\r\n  been used for the interment of the dead for centuries, the ground of\r\n  which was raised much above its natural level, and was saturated\r\n  with the remains of the bodies of the dead. There were vaults\r\n  beneath the church, in which it was still the custom, as it had long\r\n  been, to bury the dead. The girl in question had recently returned\r\n  from the country, where she had been at school. On the preceding\r\n  Friday, that is, on the fourth day before Mr. Hutchinson saw her,\r\n  she had assisted her mother during three hours and on the Saturday\r\n  during one hour, in shaking and cleansing the matting of the aisles\r\n  and pews of the church. The mother stated, that this work was\r\n  generally done once in six weeks; that the dust and effluvia which\r\n  arose, always had a peculiarly fœtid and offensive odour, very\r\n  unlike the dust which collects in private houses; that it invariably\r\n  made her (the mother) ill for at least a day afterwards; and that it\r\n  used to make the grandmother of the present patient so unwell, that\r\n  she was compelled to hire a person to perform this part of her duty.\r\n  On the afternoon of the same day on which the young person now ill\r\n  had been engaged in her employment, she was seized with shivering,\r\n  severe pain in the head, back, and limbs, and other symptoms of\r\n  commencing fever. On the following day all these symptoms were\r\n  aggravated, and in two days afterwards, when Mr. Hutchinson first\r\n  saw her, malignant fever was fully developed, the skin being burning\r\n  hot, the tongue dry and covered with a dark brown fur, the thirst\r\n  urgent, the pain of the head, back, and extremities severe, attended\r\n  with hurried and oppressed breathing, great restlessness and\r\n  prostration, anxiety of countenance, low muttering delirium, and a\r\n  pulse of 130 in the minute.\r\n\r\n  In this case it is probable that particles of noxious animal matter\r\n  progressively accumulated in the matting during the intervals\r\n  between the cleansing of it; and that being set free by this\r\n  operation and diffused in the atmosphere, while they were powerful\r\n  enough always sensibly to affect even those who were accustomed to\r\n  inhale them, were sufficiently concentrated to produce actual fever\r\n  in one wholly unaccustomed to them, and rendered increasingly\r\n  susceptible to their influence by recent residence in the pure air\r\n  of the country; for it is remarkable that miasms sometimes act with\r\n  the greatest intensity on those who habitually breathe the purest\r\n  air.\r\n\r\n  The miasms arising from church-yards are in general too much diluted\r\n  by the surrounding air to strike the neighbouring inhabitants with\r\n  sudden and severe disease, yet they may materially injure the\r\n  health, and the evidence appears to me to be decisive that they\r\n  often do so. Among others who sometimes obviously suffer from this\r\n  cause, are the families of clergymen, when, as occasionally happens,\r\n  the vicarage or rectory is situated very close to a full\r\n  church-yard. I myself know one such clergyman’s family, whose\r\n  dwelling-house is so close to an extremely full churchyard, that a\r\n  very disagreeable smell from the graves is always perceptible in\r\n  some of the sitting and sleeping rooms. The mother of this family\r\n  states that she has never had a day’s health since she has resided\r\n  in this house, and that her children are always ailing; and their\r\n  ill health is attributed, both by the family and their medical\r\n  friends, to the offensive exhalations from the church-yard.\r\n\r\nDr. Lyon Playfair states as follows in his communication—\r\n\r\n  There are two kinds of changes which animal and vegetable matters\r\n  undergo, when exposed to certain influences. These are known by the\r\n  terms of “decay” and “putrefaction.” Decay, properly so called, is a\r\n  union of the elements of organic matter with the oxygen of the air;\r\n  while putrefaction, although generally commencing with decay, is a\r\n  change or transformation of the elements of the organic body itself,\r\n  without any necessary union with the oxygen of the air. When decay\r\n  proceeds in a body without putrefaction, offensive smells are not\r\n  generated; but if the air in contact with the decaying matter be in\r\n  any way deficient, the decay passes into putrefaction, and putrid\r\n  smells arise. Putrid smells are rarely if ever evolved from\r\n  substances destitute of the element nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  Both decaying and putrefying matters are capable of communicating\r\n  their own state of putrefaction or of decay to any organic matter\r\n  with which they may come in contact. To take the simplest case, a\r\n  piece of decayed wood, a decaying orange, or a piece of tainted\r\n  flesh is capable of causing similar decay or putrefaction in another\r\n  piece of wood, orange, or flesh. In a similar manner the decaying\r\n  gases evolved from sewers occasion the putrescence of meat or of\r\n  vegetables hung in the vicinity of the place from which they escape.\r\n  But this communication of putrefaction is not confined to dead\r\n  matter. When tainted meat or putrescent blood-puddings are taken as\r\n  food, their state of putrefaction is frequently communicated to the\r\n  bodies of the persons who have used them as food. A disease\r\n  analogous to rot ensues, and generally terminates fatally. Happily\r\n  this disease is little known among us, but it is of very frequent\r\n  occurrence in Germany.\r\n\r\n  The decay or putrefaction communicated by putrid gases or by\r\n  decaying matters does not always assume one form, but varies\r\n  according to the organs to which their peculiar state is imparted.\r\n  If communicated to the blood it might possibly happen that fever may\r\n  arise; if to the intestines, dysentery or diarrhœa might result; and\r\n  I think it might even be a question worthy of consideration, whether\r\n  consumption may not arise from such exposure. Certainly it seems to\r\n  do so among cattle. The men who are employed in cleaning out drains\r\n  are very liable to the attacks of dysentery and of diarrhœa; and I\r\n  recollect instances of similar diseases occurring among some\r\n  fellow-students, when I attended the dissecting-rooms.\r\n\r\n  The effects produced by decaying emanations will vary according to\r\n  the state of putrefaction or decay in which these emanations are, as\r\n  well as according to their intensity and concentration. Thus it\r\n  occurs frequently that persons susceptible to contagion may be in\r\n  the vicinity of a fever patient without acquiring the disease. I\r\n  know one celebrated medical man who attends his own patients in\r\n  fever without danger, but who has never been able to take charge of\r\n  the fever-wards in an infirmary, from the circumstance of his being\r\n  unable to resist the influence of the contagion under such\r\n  circumstances. This gentleman has had fever several times. This\r\n  shows that the contagion of fever requires a certain degree of\r\n  _concentration_ before it is able to produce its immediate effects.\r\n  A knowledge of this circumstance has induced several infirmaries\r\n  (the Bristol infirmary, for example) to abolish altogether\r\n  fever-wards and to scatter the fever cases indiscriminately through\r\n  the medical wards. Owing to this distribution, cases in which fever\r\n  is communicated to other patients or nurses in the infirmary are\r\n  very unfrequent, although they are far from being so in those\r\n  hospitals where the fever cases are grouped together.\r\n\r\n  I consider that the want of attention to the circumstance of the\r\n  concentration of decaying emanations is a great reason that the\r\n  effects of miasmata in producing fever is still a _questio vexata_.\r\n  Thus there may be many church-yards and sewers evolving decaying\r\n  matter, and yet no fever may occur in the locality. Some other more\r\n  modified effect may be produced, according to the degree of\r\n  concentration of the decaying matter, such as diarrhœa or even\r\n  dysentery; or there may be no perceptible effects produced, although\r\n  the blood may still be thrown into a diseased state which will\r\n  render it susceptible to any specific contagion that approaches. It\r\n  must be remembered that decaying exhalations will not always produce\r\n  similar effects, but that these will vary not only according to the\r\n  concentration, but also according to the state of decomposition in\r\n  which the decaying matters are.\r\n\r\n  The rennet for making cheese is in a peculiar state of decay, or\r\n  rather is capable of a series of states of decay, and the flavour of\r\n  the cheese manufactured by means of it varies also according to the\r\n  state of the rennet. Just so with the diseases produced by the\r\n  peculiar state or concentration of decaying matters or of specific\r\n  contagions. When the Asiatic cholera visited this country many of\r\n  the towns were afflicted with dysentery before the cholera appeared\r\n  in an unquestionable form. In like manner the miasmata evolved from\r\n  church-yards may produce injurious effects which may not be\r\n  sufficiently marked to call attention until they assume a more\r\n  serious form by becoming more concentrated. But notwithstanding the\r\n  absence of marked effects, it is extremely probable that constant\r\n  exposure to miasmata may produce a diseased state of the blood. Thus\r\n  I had occasion to visit and report upon, amongst other matters, the\r\n  state of slaughter-houses in Bristol. These are generally situated\r\n  in courts, very inefficiently ventilated, as all courts are. I\r\n  remarked that the men employed in the slaughter-houses had a\r\n  remarkably cadaverous hue, and this was participated in a greater or\r\n  less degree by the inhabitants of the court. So much was this the\r\n  case, that in a court where the smells from the slaughter-house were\r\n  so offensive that my companion had immediately to retire from\r\n  sickness, I immediately singled out one person as not belonging to\r\n  the court from a number of people who ran out of their houses to\r\n  inquire the object of my visit. The person who attracted my\r\n  attention from her healthy appearance compared with the others, had\r\n  entered this court to pay a visit to a neighbour.\r\n\r\n§ 11. That conclusions respecting such immensely important effects can\r\nonly be established by reasonings on facts frequently so scattered over\r\ndistant times and places as to require much research to bring them\r\ntogether; that those conclusions are still open to controversy, and have\r\nhitherto been maintained only by references to statements of distant\r\nobservations, whilst regularly sustained examinations of the events\r\noccurring daily in our large towns might have placed them beyond a\r\ndoubt; may be submitted as showing the necessity of some public\r\narrangements to ensure constant attention, and complete information on\r\nthese subjects, as the basis of complete measures of prevention.\r\n\r\n§ 12. The conclusions, however, which appear to be firmly established by\r\nthe evidence, and the preponderant medical testimony, are on every\r\npoint, as to the essential character of the physical evils connected\r\nwith the practice of interment, so closely coincident with the\r\nconclusions deduced from observation on the continent, that from Dr.\r\nRiecke’s report (and to which a prize was awarded by an eminent medical\r\nassociation), in which the preponderant medical opinions are set forth,\r\nthey may be stated in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n“The general conclusions from the foregoing report may be given as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The injurious effect of the exhalations from the decomposition in\r\nquestion upon the health and life of man is proved by a sufficient\r\nnumber of trustworthy facts;\r\n\r\n“That this injurious influence is by no means constant, and depends on\r\nvarying and not yet sufficiently explained circumstances;\r\n\r\n“That this injurious influence is manifest in proportion to the degree\r\nof concentration of putrid emanations, especially in confined spaces;\r\nand in such cases of concentration the injurious influence is manifest\r\nin the production of asphyxia and the sudden and entire extinction of\r\nlife;\r\n\r\n“That, in a state less concentrated, putrid emanations produce various\r\neffects on the nerves of less importance, as fainting, nausea,\r\nhead-ache, languor;\r\n\r\n“These emanations, however, if their effect is often repeated, or if the\r\nemanations be long applied, produce nervous and putrid fevers; or impart\r\nto fevers, which have arisen from other causes, a typhoid or putrid\r\ncharacter;\r\n\r\n“Apparently they furnish the principal cause of the most developed form\r\nof typhus, that is to say, the plague (_Der Bubonenpest_). Besides the\r\nproducts of decomposition, the contagious material may also be active in\r\nthe emanations arising from dead bodies.”\r\n\r\n§ 13. Such being the nature of the emanations from human remains in a\r\nstate of decomposition, or in a state of corruption, the obtainment of\r\nany definite or proximate evidence of the extent of the operation of\r\nthose emanations on the health of the population nevertheless appears to\r\nbe hopeless in crowded districts. In such districts the effects of an\r\ninvisible fluid have not been observed, amidst a complication of other\r\ncauses, each of a nature ascertained to produce an injurious effect upon\r\nthe public health, but undistinguished, except when it accidentally\r\nbecomes predominant. The sense of smell in the majority of inhabitants\r\nseems to be destroyed, and having no perception even of stenches which\r\nare insupportable to strangers, they must be unable to note the\r\nexcessive escapes of miasma as antecedents to disease. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, some medical witnesses, who have been accustomed to the smell\r\nof the dissecting-room, detect the smell of human remains from the\r\ngrave-yards, in crowded districts; and other witnesses have stated that\r\nthey can distinguish what is called the “dead man’s smell,” when no one\r\nelse can, and can distinguish it from the miasma of the sewers.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the predominance of the smell from the grave-yard, the\r\nimmediate consequence ordinarily noted is a head-ache. A military\r\nofficer stated to me that when his men occupied as a barrack a building\r\nwhich opened over a crowded burial-ground in Liverpool, the smell from\r\nthe ground was at times exceedingly offensive, and that he and his men\r\nsuffered from dysentery. A gentleman who had resided near that same\r\nground, stated to me that he was convinced that his own health, and the\r\nhealth of his children had suffered from it, and that he had removed, to\r\navoid further injury. The following testimony of a lady, respecting the\r\nmiasma which escaped from one burial-ground at Manchester, is adduced as\r\nan example of the more specific testimony as to the perception of its\r\neffects. This testimony also brings to view the circumstance that in the\r\ntowns it is not only in surface emanations from the grave-yards alone\r\nthat the morbific matter escapes.\r\n\r\n  You resided formerly in the house immediately contiguous to the\r\n  burying-ground of —— chapel, did you not?—Yes I did, but I was\r\n  obliged to leave it.\r\n\r\n  Why were you so obliged?—When the wind was west, the smell was\r\n  dreadful. There is a main sewer runs through the burying-ground, and\r\n  the smell of the dead bodies came through this sewer up our drain,\r\n  and until we got that trapped, it was quite unbearable.\r\n\r\n  Do you not think the smell arose from the emanations of the sewer,\r\n  and not from the burying-ground?—I am sure they came from the\r\n  burying-ground; the smell coming from the drain was exactly the same\r\n  as that which reached us when the wind was west, and blew upon us\r\n  from the burying-ground. The smell was very peculiar; it exactly\r\n  resembled the smell which clothes have when they are removed from a\r\n  dead body. My servants would not remain in the house on account of\r\n  it, and I had several cooks who removed on this account.\r\n\r\n  Did you observe any effects on your health when the smells were\r\n  bad?—Yes, I am liable to head-aches, and these were always bad when\r\n  the smells were so also. They were often accompanied by diarrhœa in\r\n  this house. Before I went there, and since I left, my head-aches\r\n  have been very trifling.\r\n\r\n  Were any of the other inmates of the house afflicted with illness?—I\r\n  had often to send for the surgeon to my servants, who were liable to\r\n  ulcerated sore throats.\r\n\r\n  And your children, were they also affected?—My youngest child was\r\n  very delicate, and we thought he could not have survived; since he\r\n  came here he has become quite strong and healthy, but I have no\r\n  right to say the burying-ground had any connexion with his health.\r\n\r\n§ 14. In the course of an examination of the Chairman and Surveyor of\r\nthe Holborn and Finsbury Division of Sewers, on the general management\r\nof sewers in London, the following passage occurs:—\r\n\r\n  “You do not believe that the nuisance arises in all cases from the\r\n  main sewers? (Mr. Roe)—Not always from the main sewers. (Mr.\r\n  Mills)—Connected with this point, I would mention, that where the\r\n  sewers came in contact with church-yards, the exudation is most\r\n  offensive.\r\n\r\n  “Have you noticed that in more than one case?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  “In those cases have you had any opportunities of tracing in what\r\n  manner the exudation from the church-yards passed to the sewer?—It\r\n  must have been through the sides of the sewers.\r\n\r\n  “Then, if that be the case, the sewer itself must have given\r\n  way?—No; I apprehend even if you use concrete, it is impossible but\r\n  that the adjacent waters would find their way even through cement;\r\n  it is the natural consequence. The wells of the houses adjacent to\r\n  the sewers all get dry whenever the sewers are lowered.\r\n\r\n  “You are perfectly satisfied that in the course of time\r\n  exudations very often do, to a certain extent, pass through the\r\n  brick-work?—Yes; it is impossible to prevent it.\r\n\r\n  “Have you ever happened to notice whether there was putrid matter in\r\n  all cases where the sewer passed through a burial-ground?—The last\r\n  church-yard I passed by was in the parish of St. Pancras, when the\r\n  sewer was constructing. I observed that the exudation from it into\r\n  the sewer was peculiarly offensive, and was known to arise from the\r\n  decomposition of the bodies.\r\n\r\n  “At what distance was the sewer from the church-yard where you found\r\n  that?—Thirty feet.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roe subsequently stated—\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Jacob Post, living at the corner of Church-street, Lower Road,\r\n  Islington, stated to our clerk of the works, when we were building a\r\n  sewer opposite Mr. Post’s house, that he had a pump, the water from\r\n  the well attached to which had been very good, and used for domestic\r\n  purposes; but that, since a burying-ground was formed above his\r\n  house, the water in his well had become of so disagreeable a flavour\r\n  as to prevent its being used as heretofore: and he was in hopes that\r\n  the extra depth of our sewer would relieve him from the drainage of\r\n  the burying-ground, to which he attributed the spoiling of his\r\n  water.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Brande states that he has “frequently found the well-water of\r\nLondon contaminated by organic matters and ammoniacal salts,” and refers\r\nto an instance of one well near a church-yard, “the water of which had\r\nnot only acquired odour but colour from the soil;” and mentions other\r\ninstances of which he has heard, as justifying the opinion, that as\r\n“very many of these wells are adjacent to church-yards, the accumulating\r\nsoil of which has been so heaped up by the succession of dead bodies and\r\ncoffins, and the products of their decomposition, as to form a filtering\r\napparatus, by which all _superficial_ springs must of course be more or\r\nless affected.” Some of the best springs in the metropolis are,\r\nfortunately, of a depth not likely to be considerably affected by such\r\nfiltration. In Leicester, and other places, I have been informed of the\r\ndisuse of wells near church-yards, on account of the perception of a\r\ntaint in them. The difficulty of distinguishing by any analysis the\r\nqualities of the morbific matter when held in solution or suspension in\r\nwater, in combination with other matters in towns, and the consequent\r\nimportance of the separate examination already given to those qualities,\r\nmay be appreciated from such cases as the following, which are by no\r\nmeans unfrequent. In the instance of the water of one well in the\r\nmetropolis, which had ceased to be used, in consequence of an offensive\r\ntaste (contracted, as was suspected, from the drainage of an adjacent\r\nchurch-yard), it was doubted whether it could be determined by analysis\r\nwhat portion of the pollution arose from that source, what from the\r\nleakage of adjacent cesspools, and what from the leakage of coal-gas\r\nfrom adjacent gas-pipes. In most cases of such complications, the\r\nparties responsible for any one contributing source of injury are apt to\r\nchallenge, as they may safely do, distinct proof of the separate effect\r\nproduced by that one. Popular perceptions, as well as chemical analysis,\r\nare at present equally baffled by the combination, and complaints of\r\nseparate injuries are rarely made. If, therefore, the combined evil is\r\nto remain until complaints are made of the separate causes, and their\r\nspecific effects on the health, and until they can be supported by\r\ndemonstration, perpetual immunity would be ensured to the most noxious\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThe effects of unguarded interments have, however, as will subsequently\r\nbe noticed, been observed with greater care on the continent, and the\r\nproximity of wells to burial-grounds has been reported to be injurious.\r\nThus it is stated in a collection of reports concerning the cemeteries\r\nof the town of Versailles, that the water of the wells which lie _below_\r\nthe church-yard of St. Louis could not be used on account of its stench.\r\nIn consequence of various investigations in France, a law was passed,\r\nprohibiting the opening of wells within 100 metres of any place of\r\nburial; but this distance is now stated to be insufficient for deep\r\nwells, which have been found on examination to be polluted at a distance\r\nof from 150 to 200 metres. In some parts of Germany, the opening of\r\nwells nearer than 300 feet has been prohibited.\r\n\r\n§ 15. Where the one deleterious cause is less complicated with others,\r\nas in open plains after the burial of the dead in fields of battle, the\r\neffects are perceived in the offensiveness of the surface emanations,\r\nand also in the pollution of the water, followed by disease, which\r\ncompels the survivors to change their encampments.\r\n\r\nThe fact is thus adduced in the evidence of Dr. Copeland:—\r\n\r\n“It is fully ascertained and well recognized that the alluvial soil, or\r\nwhatever soil that receives the exuviæ of animal matter, or the bodies\r\nof dead animals, will become rich in general; it will abound in animal\r\nmatter; and the water that percolates through the soil thus enriched\r\nwill thus become injurious to the health of the individuals using it:\r\nthat has been proved on many occasions, and especially in warm climates,\r\nand several remarkable facts illustrative of it occurred in the\r\npeninsular campaigns. It was found, for instance, at Ciudad Rodrigo,\r\nwhere, as Sir J. Macgregor states in his account of the health of the\r\narmy, there were 20,000 dead bodies put into the ground within the space\r\nof two or three months, that this circumstance appeared to influence the\r\nhealth of the troops, inasmuch as for some months afterwards all those\r\nexposed to the emanations from the soil, as well as obliged to drink the\r\nwater from the sunk wells, were affected by malignant and low fevers and\r\ndysentery, or fevers frequently putting on a dysenteric character.”\r\n\r\n§ 16. In the metropolis, on spaces of ground which do not exceed 203\r\nacres, closely surrounded by the abodes of the living, layer upon layer,\r\neach consisting of a population numerically equivalent to a large army\r\nof 20,000 adults, and nearly 30,000 youths and children, is every year\r\nimperfectly interred. Within the period of the existence of the present\r\ngeneration, upwards of a million of dead must have been interred in\r\nthose same spaces.\r\n\r\n§ 17. A layer of bodies is stated to be about seven years in decaying in\r\nthe metropolis: to the extent that this is so, the decay must be by the\r\nconversion of the remains into a gas, and its escape, as a miasma, of\r\nmany times the bulk of the body that has disappeared.\r\n\r\n§ 18. In some of the populous parishes, where, from the nature of the\r\nsoil, the decomposition has not been so rapid as the interments, the\r\nplace of burial has risen in height; and the height of many of them must\r\nhave greatly increased but for surreptitious modes of diminishing it by\r\nremoval, which, it must be confessed, has diminished the sanitary evil,\r\nthough by the creation of another and most serious evil, in the mental\r\npain and apprehensions of the survivors and feelings of abhorrence of\r\nthe population, caused by the suspicion and knowledge of the disrespect\r\nand desecration of the remains of the persons interred.\r\n\r\n§ 19. The claims to exemption in favour of burial-grounds which it is\r\nstated are not overcrowded would perhaps be most favourably considered\r\nby the examination of the practice of interment in the new cemeteries,\r\nwhere the proportion of interments to the space is much less.\r\n\r\n§ 20. I have visited and questioned persons connected with several of\r\nthese cemeteries in town and country, and I have caused the practice of\r\ninterments in others of them to be examined by more competent persons.\r\nThe inquiry brought forward instances of the bursting of some leaden\r\ncoffins and the escape of mephitic vapour in the catacombs; the tapping\r\nof others to prevent similar casualties; injuries sustained by\r\ngrave-diggers from the escapes of miasma on the re-opening of graves,\r\nand an instance was stated to me by the architect of one cemetery, of\r\ntwo labourers having been injured, apparently by digging amidst some\r\nimpure water which drained from some graves. No precedent examination of\r\nthe evils affecting the public health, that are incident to the practice\r\nof interment, appears to have been made, no precedent scientific or\r\nimpartial investigation appears to have been thought necessary by the\r\njoint-stock companies, or by the Committees of the House of Commons, at\r\nwhose instance privileges were conferred upon the shareholders: no new\r\nprecautionary measures or improvements, such as are in use abroad,\r\nappear consequently to have been introduced in them; the practice of\r\nburial has in general been simply removed to better looking, and in\r\ngeneral, better situated places. The conclusion, however, from the\r\nexamination of these places (which will subsequently be reverted to) is,\r\nthat if most of the cemeteries themselves were in the midst of the\r\npopulation, they would, even in their present state, often contribute to\r\nthe combination of causes of ill health in the metropolis, and several\r\nof the larger towns.\r\n\r\n§ 21. It has been considered that all danger from interments in towns\r\nwould be obviated if no burials were allowed except at a depth of five\r\nfeet. But bodies buried much deeper are found to decay; and so certain\r\nas a body has wasted or disappeared is the fact that a deleterious gas\r\nhas escaped. In the towns where the grave-yards and streets are paved,\r\nthe morbific matter must be diffused more widely through the subsoil,\r\nand escape with the drainage. If the interments be so deep as to impede\r\nescapes at the surface, there is only the greater danger of escape by\r\ndeep drainage and the pollution of springs.\r\n\r\nDr. Reid detected the escape of deleterious miasma from graves of more\r\nthan 20 feet deep. He states—\r\n\r\n  In some churchyards I have noticed the ground to be absolutely\r\n  saturated with carbonic acid gas, so that whenever a deep grave was\r\n  dug it was filled in some hours afterwards with such an amount of\r\n  carbonic acid gas that the workmen could not descend without danger.\r\n  Deaths have, indeed, occurred occasionally in some churchyards from\r\n  this cause, and in a series of experiments made in one of the\r\n  churchyards at Manchester, where deep graves are made, each capable\r\n  of receiving from 20 to 30 bodies, I found in general that a grave\r\n  covered on the top at night was more or less loaded with carbonic\r\n  acid in the morning, and that it was essential, accordingly, to\r\n  ventilate these grave-pits before it was safe to descend.\r\n\r\n  This I effected on some occasions by means of a small chauffer\r\n  placed at the top, and at one end of the grave a tube or hose being\r\n  let down from it to the bottom of the grave. The fire was sustained\r\n  by the admission of a small portion of fresh air at the top, and the\r\n  air from the bottom of the grave was gradually removed as the upper\r\n  stratum was heated by the fire around which it was conveyed; and\r\n  when it had been once emptied in this manner a small fire was found\r\n  sufficient to sustain a perpetual renewal of air, and prevent the\r\n  men at work in the grave-pits from being subject to the extreme\r\n  oppression to which they are otherwise liable, even when there may\r\n  be no immediate danger. A mechanical power might be used for the\r\n  same purpose; and chemical agents, as a quantity of newly slaked\r\n  lime, are frequently employed, as they absorb the carbonic acid.\r\n  From different circumstances that have since occurred, it appears to\r\n  me probable that numerous examples of strata or superficial soil\r\n  containing carbonic acid may be more frequently met with than is\r\n  generally suspected, and that while in churchyards the presence of\r\n  large quantities of carbonic acid may be frequently anticipated, its\r\n  presence must not always be attributed solely to the result of the\r\n  decomposition of the human body.\r\n\r\n  The amount of carbonic acid that collects within a given time in a\r\n  deep grave-pit intended to receive 20 or 30 bodies, is much\r\n  influenced by the nature of the ground in which it is dug. In the\r\n  case referred to, the porous texture of the earth allowed a\r\n  comparatively free aerial communication below the surface of the\r\n  ground throughout its whole extent. It was, in reality, loaded with\r\n  carbonic acid in the same manner as other places are loaded with\r\n  water; it was only necessary to sink a pit, and a well of carbonic\r\n  acid was formed, into which a constant stream of the same gas\r\n  continued perpetually to filter from the adjacent earth, according\r\n  to the extent to which it was removed. From whatever source,\r\n  however, the carbonic acid may arise, it is not the less prone to\r\n  mingle with the surrounding air, and where the level of the floor of\r\n  the church is below the level of the churchyard, there the carbonic\r\n  acid is prone to accumulate, as, though it may be ultimately\r\n  dispersed by diffusion, it may be considered as flowing in the same\r\n  manner in the first instance as water, where the quantity is\r\n  considerable.\r\n\r\n  Again, where the drainage of the district in which the church may be\r\n  placed is of an inferior description, and liable to be impeded\r\n  periodically by the state of the tide, as in the vicinity of the\r\n  Houses of Parliament, where all the drains are closed at high water,\r\n  the atmosphere is frequently of the most inferior quality. I am\r\n  fully satisfied, for instance, not only from my own observation, but\r\n  from different statements that have reached me, and also from the\r\n  observations of parties who have repeatedly examined the subject at\r\n  my request, that the state of the burying-ground around St.\r\n  Margaret’s church is prejudicial to the air supplied at the Houses\r\n  of Parliament, and also to the whole neighbourhood. One of them,\r\n  indeed, stated to me lately that he had avoided the churchyard for\r\n  the last six months, in consequence of the effects he experienced\r\n  the last time he visited it. These offensive emanations have been\r\n  noticed at all hours of the night and morning; and even during the\r\n  day the smell of the churchyard has been considered to have reached\r\n  the vaults in the House of Commons, and traced to sewers in its\r\n  immediate vicinity. When the barometer is low, the surface of the\r\n  ground slightly moist, the tide full, and the temperature\r\n  considerable—all which circumstances tend to favour the evolution of\r\n  effluvia both from the grave-pits and the drains—the most injurious\r\n  influence upon the air is observed. In some places not far from this\r\n  churchyard fresh meat is frequently tainted in a single night, on\r\n  the ground-floor, in situations where at a higher level it may be\r\n  kept without injury for a much longer period. In some cases, in\r\n  private houses as well as at the Houses of Parliament, I have had to\r\n  make use of ventilating shafts, or of preparations of chlorine, to\r\n  neutralize the offensive and deleterious effects which the\r\n  exhalations produced, while, on other occasions, their injurious\r\n  influence has been abundantly manifested by the change induced in\r\n  individuals subjected to their influence on removing to another\r\n  atmosphere. No grievance, perhaps, entails greater physical evils\r\n  upon any district than the conjoined influence of bad drainage and\r\n  crowded churchyards; and until the drainage of air from drains shall\r\n  be secured by the process adverted to in another part of this work,\r\n  or some equivalent measures, they cannot be regarded as free from a\r\n  very important defect.\r\n\r\n  The drainage of air from drains is, indeed, desirable under any\r\n  circumstances; but when the usual contaminations of the drain are\r\n  increased by the emanations from a loaded churchyard, it becomes\r\n  doubly imperative to introduce such measures; and if any one should\r\n  desire to trace the progress of reaction by which the grave-yards\r\n  are continually tending to free themselves of their contents, a very\r\n  brief inquiry will give him abundant evidence on this point. My\r\n  attention was first directed to this matter in London ten years ago,\r\n  when a glass of water handed to me at an hotel, in another district,\r\n  presented a peculiar film on its surface, which led me to set it\r\n  aside; and after numerous inquiries, I was fully satisfied that the\r\n  appearance which had attracted my attention arose from the coffins\r\n  in a churchyard immediately adjoining the well where the water had\r\n  been drawn. Defective as our information is as to the precise\r\n  qualities of the various products from drains, church-yards, and\r\n  other similar places, I think I have seen enough to satisfy me that\r\n  in all such situations the fluids of the living system imbibe\r\n  materials which, though they do not always produce great severity of\r\n  disease, speedily induce a morbid condition, which, while it renders\r\n  the body more prone to attacks of fever, is more especially\r\n  indicated by the facility with which all the fluids pass to a state\r\n  of putrefaction, and the rapidity with which the slightest wound or\r\n  cut is apt to pass into a sore.\r\n\r\nMr. Leigh, surgeon and lecturer of chemistry at Manchester, confirms the\r\nresearches made by Dr. Reid in that town, and observes on this subject—\r\n\r\n  But the decomposition of animal bodies is remarkably modified by\r\n  external circumstances where the bodies are immersed in or\r\n  surrounded by water, and particularly, if the water undergo frequent\r\n  change, the solid tissues become converted into adipocire, a fatty\r\n  spermaceti-like substance, not very prone to decomposition, and this\r\n  change is effected without much gaseous exhalation. Under such\r\n  circumstances nothing injurious could arise, but under ordinary\r\n  conditions slow decomposition would take place, with the usual\r\n  products of the decomposition of animal matters, and here the nature\r\n  of the soil becomes of much interest. If the burial-ground be in\r\n  damp dense compact clay, with much water, the water will collect\r\n  round the body, and there will be a disposition to the formation of\r\n  adipocire, whilst the clay will effectually prevent the escape of\r\n  gaseous matter. If on the other hand the bodies be laid in sand or\r\n  gravel, decomposition will readily take place, the gases will easily\r\n  permeate the superjacent soil and escape into the atmosphere, and\r\n  this with a facility which may be judged of when the fact is stated,\r\n  that under a pressure of only three-fourths of an inch of water,\r\n  coal gas will escape by any leakage in the conduit pipes through a\r\n  stratum of sand or gravel of three feet in thickness in an\r\n  exceedingly short space of time. The three feet of soil seems to\r\n  oppose scarcely any resistance to its passage to the surface; but if\r\n  the joints of the pipes be enveloped by a thin layer of clay, the\r\n  escape is effectually prevented.\r\n\r\n  If bodies were interred eight or ten feet deep in sandy or gravelly\r\n  soils, I am convinced little would be gained by it; the gases would\r\n  find a ready exit from almost any practicable depth.\r\n\r\n§ 22. He also expresses an opinion concurrent with that of other\r\nphysiologists, that the effects of these escapes in an otherwise\r\nsalubrious locality, soon attract notice, but their influence in\r\nobedience to the laws of gaseous diffusion, developed by Dalton and\r\nGraham, is not the less when scattered over a town, because in a\r\nmultitude of scents they escape observation. In open rural districts\r\nthese gases soon intermix with the circumambient air, and become so\r\nvastly diluted that their injurious tendency is less potent.\r\n\r\nOther physical facts which it is necessary to develope in respect to the\r\npractice of interment may be the most conveniently considered in a\r\nsubsequent portion of this report, where it is necessary to adduce the\r\ninformation possessed, as to the sites of places of burial, and the\r\nsanitary precautions necessary in respect to them.\r\n\r\n§ 23. From what has already been adduced, it may here be stated as a\r\nconclusion,\r\n\r\nThat inasmuch as there appear to be no cases in which the emanations\r\nfrom human remains in an advanced stage of decomposition are not of a\r\ndeleterious nature, so there is no case in which the liability to danger\r\nshould be incurred either by interment (or by entombment in vaults,\r\nwhich is the most dangerous) amidst the dwellings of the living, it\r\nbeing established as a general conclusion in respect to the physical\r\ncircumstances of interment, from which no adequate grounds of exception\r\nhave been established;—\r\n\r\nThat all interments in towns, where bodies decompose, contribute to the\r\nmass of atmospheric impurity which is injurious to the public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Injuries to the Health of Survivors occasioned by the delay of\r\n                              Interments._\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the state of feeling of the labouring classes,\r\nand the general influence upon them, and even the effects on their\r\nhealth, of the practice of interment, it will be necessary to submit for\r\nconsideration those circumstances which immediately precede the\r\ninterment, namely, the most common circumstances of the death.\r\n\r\n§ 24. In a large proportion of cases in the metropolis, and in some of\r\nthe manufacturing districts, one room serves for one family of the\r\nlabouring classes: it is their bed-room, their kitchen, their washhouse,\r\ntheir sitting room, their dining room; and, when they do not follow any\r\nout-door occupation, it is frequently their work room and their shop. In\r\nthis one room they are born, and live, and sleep, and die amidst, the\r\nother inmates.\r\n\r\n§ 25. Their common condition in large towns has been developed by\r\nvarious inquiries, more completely than by the census. As an instance,\r\nthe results may be given of an inquiry lately made, at the instance and\r\nexpense of Lord Sandon, by Mr. Weld, the secretary of the Statistical\r\nSociety, as to the condition of the working classes resident in the\r\ninner ward of St. George’s, Hanover Square, and in the immediate\r\nvicinity of some of the most opulent residences in the metropolis. It\r\nappeared that 1465 families of the labouring classes had for their\r\nresidence 2175 rooms, and 2510 beds. The distribution of rooms and beds\r\nwas as follows:—\r\n\r\n ─────────────────────────┬─────────╥─────────────────────────┬─────────\r\n        DWELLINGS.        │Number of║          BEDS.          │Number of\r\n                          │Families.║                         │Families.\r\n ─────────────────────────┼─────────╫─────────────────────────┼─────────\r\n Single rooms for each    │      929║One bed to each family   │      623\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Two rooms for each family│      408║Two beds to each family  │      638\r\n Three rooms for each     │       94║Three beds to each family│      154\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Four rooms for each      │       17║Four beds to each family │       21\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Five rooms for each      │        8║Five beds to each family │        8\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Six rooms for each family│        4║Six beds to each family  │        3\r\n Seven rooms for each     │        1║Seven beds to each family│        1\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Eight rooms for each     │        1║Dwellings without a bed  │        7\r\n   family                 │         ║                         │\r\n Not ascertained          │        3║Not ascertained          │       10\r\n                          │    —————║                         │    —————\r\n           Total          │    1,465║          Total          │    1,465\r\n ─────────────────────────┴─────────╨─────────────────────────┴─────────\r\n\r\nOut of 5945 persons 839 were found to be ill, and yet the season was not\r\nunhealthy. One family in 11 had a third room (and that not unoccupied)\r\nin which to place a corpse. This, however, appears to be a favourable\r\nspecimen. From an examination made by a committee of the Statistical\r\nSociety into the condition of the poorer classes in the borough of\r\nMarylebone, it appeared that the distribution of rooms amongst the\r\nportion of population examined showed that not more than one family in a\r\nhundred had a third room.\r\n\r\n  No. occupying part of a room, 159 families, and 196 single persons.\r\n  No. occupying one room        382 families, and  56 single persons.\r\n  No. occupying two rooms        61 families, and   2 single persons.\r\n  No. occupying three rooms       5 families, and   7 single persons.\r\n  No. occupying four rooms        1 families, and   0 single persons.\r\n\r\n§ 26. Mr. Leonard, surgeon and medical officer of the parish of St.\r\nMartin’s-in-the-Fields, gives the following instances of the\r\ncircumstances in which the poorest class of inhabitants die, which may\r\nbe adduced as exemplifications of the dreadful state of circumstances in\r\nwhich the survivors are placed for the want of adequate accommodation\r\nfor the remains immediately after death, and previous to the interment:—\r\n\r\n  There are some houses in my district that have from 45 to 60 persons\r\n  of all ages under one roof, and in the event of death, the body\r\n  often occupies the only bed till they raise money to pay for a\r\n  coffin, which is often several days. They are crowded together in\r\n  houses situate in Off-alley, the courts and alleys opening from\r\n  Bedfordbury, Rose-street, Angel-court, courts and alleys opening\r\n  from Drury-lane and the Strand, and even in places fitted up under\r\n  the Adelphi arches; even the unventilated and damp underground\r\n  kitchens are tenanted. Of course the tenants are never free from\r\n  fevers and diarrhœa, and the mortality is great. The last class\r\n  live, for the most part, in lodging-rooms, where shelter is\r\n  obtained, with a bed or straw, for from 2_d._ to 4_d._ per night,\r\n  and where this is not obtainable, the arches under the Adelphi\r\n  afford a shelter. In the lodging-rooms I have seen the beds placed\r\n  so close together as not to allow room to pass between them, and\r\n  occupied by both sexes indiscriminately. I have known six people\r\n  sleep in a room about nine feet square, with only one small window,\r\n  about fifteen inches by twelve inches; and there are some\r\n  sleeping-rooms in this district in which you cannot scarcely see\r\n  your hand at noon-day.\r\n\r\n  How long is the dead body retained in the room beside the living?—If\r\n  the person has subscribed to a club, or the friends are in\r\n  circumstances to afford the expense of the funeral, it takes place,\r\n  generally, on the following Sunday, if the death has occurred early\r\n  in the week; but if towards the end of the week, then it is\r\n  sometimes postponed till the Sunday week after, if the weather\r\n  permit; in one case it was twelve days. In the other cases I have\r\n  known much opposition to removal till after a subscription had been\r\n  collected from the affluent neighbours; and in some instances, after\r\n  keeping the body several days, I have been applied to to present the\r\n  case to the relieving officer, that it might be buried by the\r\n  parish. Amongst the Irish it is retained till after the wake, which\r\n  “_is open to all comers_” as long as there is anything _dacent to\r\n  drink or smoke_; but I must bear witness, also, to the frequent\r\n  exhibition, in a large majority of the poor, of those affectionate\r\n  attentions to the mortal remains of their relatives, which all are\r\n  anxious to bestow, and which, notwithstanding the danger and want of\r\n  accommodation, make them loth to part with them.\r\n\r\n  In what condition is the corpse usually, or frequently,\r\n  retained?—Amongst the Irish, it does not signify of what disease the\r\n  person may have died, it is retained often for many days, laid out\r\n  upon the only bed, perhaps, and adorned with the best they can\r\n  bestow upon it, until the _coronach_ has been performed. Thus fevers\r\n  and other contagious diseases are fearfully propagated. I remember a\r\n  case of a body being brought from the Fever Hospital to\r\n  Bullin-court, and the consequences were dreadful; and this spring I\r\n  removed a girl, named Wilson, to the infirmary of the workhouse,\r\n  from a room in the same court. I could not remain two minutes in it;\r\n  the horrible stench arose from a corpse which had died of phthisis\r\n  twelve days before, and the coffin stood across the foot of the bed,\r\n  within eighteen inches of it. This was in a small room not above ten\r\n  feet by twelve feet square, and a fire always in it, being (as in\r\n  most cases of a like kind) the only one for sleeping, living, and\r\n  cooking in. I mention these as being particular cases, from which\r\n  most marked consequences followed; but I have very many others, in\r\n  which the retention of the body has been fraught with serious\r\n  results to the survivors.\r\n\r\n  Will you describe the consequences of such retention?—Upon the 9th\r\n  of March, 1840, M—— was taken to the Fever Hospital. He died there,\r\n  and without my knowledge the body was brought back to his own room.\r\n  The usual practice, in such cases, is to receive them into a\r\n  lock-up-room, set apart for that purpose in the workhouse. I find\r\n  that upon the 12th his step-son was taken ill. He was removed\r\n  immediately to the Fever Hospital. Upon the 18th the barber who\r\n  shaved the corpse was taken ill, and died in the Fever Hospital, and\r\n  upon the 27th another step-son was taken ill, and removed also.\r\n\r\n  Upon the 18th of December, 1840, I—— and her infant were brought,\r\n  ill with fever, to her father’s room in Eagle-court, which was ten\r\n  feet square, with a small window of four panes; the infant soon\r\n  died. Upon the 15th of January, 1841, the grandmother was taken ill;\r\n  upon the 2nd of February the grandfather also. There was but one\r\n  bedstead in the room. They resisted every offer to remove them, and\r\n  I had no power to compel removal. The corpse of the grandmother lay\r\n  beside her husband upon the same bed, and it was only when he became\r\n  delirious and incapable of resistance that I ordered the removal of\r\n  the body to the dead-room, and him to the Fever Hospital. He died\r\n  there, but the evil did not stop here: two children, who followed\r\n  their father’s body to the grave, were, the one within a week and\r\n  the other within ten days, also victims to the same disease. In\r\n  short, five out of six died.\r\n\r\n  In October, 1841, a fine girl, C——, died of cynanche maligna: her\r\n  body was retained in a small back room. Upon the 1st of November\r\n  another child was taken ill, and upon the 4th two others were also\r\n  seized with the same disease.\r\n\r\n  Upon the 2nd of February, 1843, H——, in Heathcock-court, died of\r\n  fever. I recommended the immediate removal of the body from the\r\n  attic room of small dimensions, but it was retained about ten days,\r\n  the widow not consenting to have it buried by the parish, and not\r\n  being able to collect funds sooner: their only child was seized with\r\n  fever, and was several weeks ill.\r\n\r\n  Upon the 3rd of March, 1843, B—— died of a fever in Lemontree-yard;\r\n  the body was retained some days, in expectation of friends burying\r\n  it, but in the mean time a child of B——, and one of a lodger in the\r\n  same house, were infected.\r\n\r\n  Upon the 13th March, 1843, I saw a family in Hervey’s-buildings,\r\n  which is more open, and the rooms of a better class than those in\r\n  some other situations. I found there the corpse of a person who had\r\n  died of a fever; the father and mother were just taken ill, and a\r\n  child was taken ill soon after. The foot of the coffin was within\r\n  ten inches of the father’s head as he lay upon his pillow. I caused\r\n  it to be removed as soon as possible, and the three cases terminated\r\n  favourably. In the case in Bullin-court, mentioned before, the girl\r\n  Wilson was affected with nausea vertigo, general prostration of\r\n  strength, and trembling, the usual symptoms in these cases. Soon\r\n  after her removal, the mother of the deceased was seized with\r\n  typhus, and is now only so far recovered as scarcely to be able to\r\n  go about and attend to another son, who is at present ill of the\r\n  same disease. These are a few cases only in which serious evils\r\n  followed on retention of the body. I could multiply them, if\r\n  necessary; but they will suffice to show that there should be power\r\n  of removal to some recognized place of safety given to the district\r\n  medical officer for the benefit of the individuals concerned and the\r\n  public at large. The rooms are often most wretched in which these\r\n  cases occur; the neighbourhood is badly ventilated and drained, or\r\n  often not drained at all, and if the medical officer were\r\n  responsible for his acts, and bound to report regularly, there would\r\n  be a sufficient guarantee that no unnecessary harshness would be\r\n  exercised in the performance of a duty absolutely required for the\r\n  preservation of the public health, and the safety of those dearest\r\n  to the sufferers themselves.\r\n\r\n  Comparing the effects of the practice of retaining the bodies before\r\n  interment, with the effects of emanations from the dead after\r\n  interment, when buried in crowded districts, which appears to you to\r\n  be the most pernicious practice?—When a body is retained in a small\r\n  room, badly ventilated, and often with a fire in it, the noxious\r\n  gases evolved in the process of decomposition are presented to\r\n  persons exposed to them in a highly concentrated form, and if their\r\n  health is in a certain state favourable to receive the contagion,\r\n  the effect is immediate. In crowded burial-grounds in which I have\r\n  never seen a body at a less depth than three feet from the surface\r\n  (allowing for the artificial building up of the ground to give\r\n  apparent depth to the grave), the gases having this thickness of\r\n  earth to penetrate, arrive at the surface in a divided state, and by\r\n  small quantities at a time mix so gradually with the atmosphere,\r\n  that it becomes comparatively harmless by dilution, and is scarcely\r\n  perceptible. In confined situations, where the ground is limited in\r\n  extent, the long continuance of gradual evolutions of noxious matter\r\n  would, doubtless, be a cause of debility to surrounding inhabitants;\r\n  but such instances, I think, are rare. I have made inquiry in the\r\n  immediate neighbourhood of grave-yards, and I form my opinion from\r\n  the result. There can be no doubt whatever as to the propriety of\r\n  burial beyond the limits of towns, and if the corpse of the poor man\r\n  could be deposited at a distance, without entailing a greater\r\n  expense upon him, I think it would improve the health of our large\r\n  towns very much; but I believe the retention of the corpse in the\r\n  room with the living is fraught with greater danger than that\r\n  produced by the emanations from even crowded grave-yards.\r\n\r\n§ 27. The condition in which the remains are often found on the\r\noccurrence of a death at the eastern part of the metropolis are thus\r\ndescribed by Mr. John Liddle, the medical officer of the Whitechapel\r\ndistrict of the Whitechapel Union.\r\n\r\n  What is the class of poor persons whom you, as medical officer, are\r\n  called upon to attend to?—The dock labourers, navigators,\r\n  bricklayers’ labourers, and the general description of labourers\r\n  inhabiting Whitechapel and lower Aldgate.\r\n\r\n  On the occurrence of a death amongst this description of labourers,\r\n  what do you find to be the general condition of the family, in\r\n  relation to the remains. How is the corpse dealt with?—Nearly the\r\n  whole of the labouring population there have only one room. The\r\n  corpse is therefore kept in that room where the inmates sleep and\r\n  have their meals. Sometimes the corpse is stretched on the bed, and\r\n  the bed and bed-clothes are taken off, and the wife and family lie\r\n  on the floor. Sometimes a board is got on which the corpse is\r\n  stretched, and that is sustained on tressels or on chairs. Sometimes\r\n  it is stretched out on chairs. When children die, they are\r\n  frequently laid out on the table. The poor Irish, if they can afford\r\n  it, form a canopy of white calico over the corpse, and buy candles\r\n  to burn by it, and place a black cross at the head of the corpse.\r\n  They commonly raise the money to do this by subscriptions amongst\r\n  themselves and at the public-houses which they frequent.\r\n\r\n  What is the usual length of time that the corpse is so kept?—The\r\n  time varies according to the day of the death. Sunday is the day\r\n  usually chosen for the day of burial. But if a man die on the\r\n  Wednesday, the burial will not take place till the Sunday week\r\n  following. Bodies are almost always kept for a full week, frequently\r\n  longer.\r\n\r\n  What proportion of these cases may be positively contagious?—It\r\n  appears from the Registrar-General’s Report (which, however, cannot\r\n  be depended on for perfect accuracy, as the registrar’s returns are\r\n  very incorrect,—I do not think I have been required to give a\r\n  certificate of death upon more than three occasions), that in the\r\n  year 1839, there were 747 deaths from epidemic diseases which formed\r\n  about one-fifth of the whole of the deaths in the Whitechapel Union.\r\n\r\n  Have you had occasion to represent as injurious this practice of\r\n  retaining the corpse amidst the living?—I have represented in\r\n  several communications in answer to sanitary inquiries from the Poor\r\n  Law Commission Office, that it must be and is highly injurious. It\r\n  was only three or four days ago that an instance of this occurred in\r\n  my own practice, which I will mention. A widow’s son, who was about\r\n  15 years of age, was taken ill of fever. Finding the room small, in\r\n  which there was a family of five persons living, I advised his\r\n  immediate removal. This was not done, and the two other sons were\r\n  shortly afterwards attacked, and both died. When fever was epidemic,\r\n  deaths following the first death in the same family were of frequent\r\n  occurrence. In cases where the survivors escape, their general\r\n  health must be deteriorated by the practice of keeping the dead in\r\n  the same room.\r\n\r\n  Do you observe any peculiarity of habit amongst the lower classes\r\n  accompanying this familiarity with the remains of the dead?—What I\r\n  observe when I first visit the room is a degree of indifference to\r\n  the presence of the corpse: the family is found eating or drinking\r\n  or pursuing their usual callings, and the children playing. Amongst\r\n  the middle classes, where there is an opportunity of putting the\r\n  corpse by itself, there are greater marks of respect and decency.\r\n  Amongst that class no one would think of doing anything in the room\r\n  where the corpse was lying, still less of allowing children there.\r\n\r\nMr. Byles, surgeon, of Spitalfields, states, that the above description\r\nis generally applicable to the condition of the dwellings of the\r\nlabouring classes, and to the circumstances under which the survivors\r\nare placed on the occurrence of a death in that district. He observes,\r\nmoreover—\r\n\r\n  In the more malignant form of fever, especially scarlatina, the\r\n  instances of death following the first case of death are frequent.\r\n  The same holds good in respect to measles, and in respect to\r\n  small-pox in families where vaccination has been neglected. I have\r\n  also known instances of children who had been vaccinated becoming\r\n  the subject of fever apparently from the effluvia of the body of a\r\n  child who had died of the small-pox. I have often had occasion\r\n  urgently to represent to the parish and union officers the necessity\r\n  of a forcible interference to remove bodies. Coffins have been sent\r\n  and the bodies removed and placed in a vault under the church until\r\n  interment, and the rooms limewashed at the expense of the parish.\r\n\r\n  Were such removals resisted?—Not generally; they were in some few\r\n  instances.\r\n\r\n§ 28. Mr. Bestow, a relieving officer of the adjacent district of\r\nBethnal Green, who is called upon to visit the abodes of those persons\r\nof the labouring classes, who on the occurrence of death fall into a\r\nstate of destitution, thus exemplifies the common consequences of the\r\nretention of the corpse in the living and working rooms of the family:—\r\n\r\n  Is the corpse generally kept in the living or in the working\r\n  room?—In the majority of cases the weavers live and work in the same\r\n  room; the children generally sleep on a bed pushed under the loom.\r\n  Before a coffin is obtained, the corpse is generally stretched on\r\n  the bed where the adults have slept. It is a very serious evil in\r\n  our district, the length of time during which bodies have been kept\r\n  under such circumstances. I have frequently had to make complaint of\r\n  it. We are very often complained to by neighbours of the length of\r\n  time during which the bodies are kept. We have very often had\r\n  disease occasioned by it. I have known, in one case, as many as\r\n  eight deaths, from typhus fever, follow one death; there were five\r\n  children and two or three visitors whose illness and deaths were\r\n  ascribed to the circumstance.\r\n\r\n  In January, 1837, a man named Clark, in George Gardens, in this\r\n  parish, having been kept a considerable length of time unburied (I\r\n  was informed beyond a fortnight), I was directed to visit the case,\r\n  and I found the house consisted of two small rooms, wherein resided\r\n  his wife and seven children. I remonstrated with them upon the\r\n  impropriety of keeping the body so long, and offered either to bury,\r\n  or to remove it, as it was then becoming very offensive. I was\r\n  informed it would be buried on the following Sunday, as it would not\r\n  be convenient for the whole of the relatives to attend the funeral\r\n  earlier, and I understood a very great number did attend. I find\r\n  that on the 30th of the same month (January) I was called again to\r\n  visit Ann Clark, one of the family, in the same miserable abode, who\r\n  was lying upon some rags, very ill of fever. I had her removed, but\r\n  she ultimately died; and I again remonstrated with the family\r\n  remaining in the same house, and offered to take them into the\r\n  workhouse, which was declined, stating, it was their intention to\r\n  remove in a few days to another house. And on the 20th of February,\r\n  my attention was called to the same family, who had then removed to\r\n  No. 3, Granby Row, not far from their former abode, and here I found\r\n  the mother and the whole of the children (as I had predicted to\r\n  them, if they persisted in their habits), all ill of fever without\r\n  much hopes of their recovery. I had five removed to the London Fever\r\n  Hospital immediately; but out of seven who were affected, two died.\r\n  My attention was shortly afterwards directed to Henry Clark, of\r\n  Barnet Street, who was a relative, and had taken fever (it was\r\n  stated) by having attended the funeral of his friend; he, it seems,\r\n  communicated it to his wife and two children, one of whom died; next\r\n  followed Stephen Clark, of Edward Street, who, having visited the\r\n  above-named relative, and attended the funeral of their infant\r\n  shortly afterwards, had fever; also his wife and three children, one\r\n  of whom died also. In August, 1837, I was called to visit the case\r\n  of Sarah Masterton, No. 11, Suffolk Street, whose husband lay dead\r\n  of fever; she was with two children in the same room, and the corpse\r\n  not in a coffin. They were in the most deplorable condition, and so\r\n  bad with fever that none of the neighbours would venture to enter\r\n  the room with me. I had the dead body removed in a shell to our\r\n  dead-house, and the woman and children to the infirmary in the\r\n  workhouse. Two of them ultimately recovered; one died. In the same\r\n  house, and in the upper room, I next found Robert Crisp, with a wife\r\n  and child, upon whom I could not prevail to leave the place, and my\r\n  urgent entreaties were treated with contempt and bad language.\r\n  Ultimately, however, his child died, and not until then could I\r\n  persuade him to get another place, neither would he have the infant\r\n  removed, or come into the workhouse himself.\r\n\r\n  William Procktor, residing in a miserable hut in Camden’s Gardens,\r\n  of only one room, with a wife and two children, when visited, was\r\n  found badly affected with fever, of which the wife died, and the\r\n  body was kept in the same place wherein all the family resided and\r\n  slept, for more than a week. The man was next attacked, and then the\r\n  children; and for a considerable time they were attended by our\r\n  medical officer, but I believe they all ultimately recovered.\r\n\r\nHis report book contained frequent instances of cases of the like\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n§ 29. Mr. T. Abraham, surgeon, one of the Registrars for the City of\r\nLondon, who has had much practice as a parochial medical officer, was\r\nasked upon this subject—\r\n\r\n  In the course of your practice, have you had occasion to believe\r\n  that evil effects are produced by the retention of the corpse in the\r\n  house?—Yes; I can give an instance of a man, his wife, and six\r\n  children, living in one room in Draper’s Buildings. The mother and\r\n  all the children successively fell ill of typhus fever: the mother\r\n  died; the body remained in the room. I wished it to be removed the\r\n  next day, and I also wished the children to be removed, being afraid\r\n  that the fever would extend. The children were apparently well at\r\n  the time of the death of the mother. The recommendation was not\r\n  attended to: the body was kept five days in the only room which this\r\n  family of eight had to live and sleep in. The eldest daughter was\r\n  attacked about a week after the mother had been removed, and, after\r\n  three days’ illness, that daughter died. The corpse of this child\r\n  was only kept three days, as we determined that it should positively\r\n  be removed. In about nine days after the death of the girl, the\r\n  youngest child was attacked, and it died in about nine days. Then\r\n  the second one was taken ill; he lay twenty-three days, and died.\r\n  Then another boy died. The two other children recovered.\r\n\r\n  By the immediate removal of the corpse, and the use of proper\r\n  preventive means, how many deaths do you believe might have been\r\n  prevented?—I think it probable that the one took it from the other,\r\n  and that, if the corpse of the first had been removed, the rest\r\n  would have escaped, although I, of course, admit that the same cause\r\n  which produced the disease in the mother might also have produced it\r\n  in the children. I believe that, in cases of typhus, scarlatina, and\r\n  other infectious diseases, it frequently happens that the living are\r\n  attacked by the same disease from the retention of the body.\r\n\r\nMr. Blencarn, surgeon, one of the medical officers of the City of London\r\nUnion, was asked—\r\n\r\n  Have you observed any evil effects following the practice of the\r\n  long retention of the corpse in the house amidst the living?—Yes; I\r\n  have observed effects follow, but I cannot say produced by them,\r\n  though they were perhaps increased by them. In those cases which I\r\n  have had, where there has been a succession of cases of fever in the\r\n  same family, after a death it has generally occurred that the\r\n  parties affected have complained two or three days before that they\r\n  felt very unwell. Generally this has been the case. I have in such\r\n  instances ordered them medicine immediately. Since the Union has\r\n  been established, we have immediately removed all fever cases to the\r\n  fever hospital.\r\n\r\n  The retention of the corpse amidst the living, under such\r\n  circumstances, must aggravate the mortality, must it not?—There\r\n  cannot be a moment’s doubt about it.\r\n\r\n§ 30. Mr. Barnett, surgeon, one of the medical officers of the Stepney\r\nUnion, thus exemplifies the effects of the practice in his own district.\r\nAfter speaking of the prevalence of nervous depression, ascribable to\r\nthe contiguity to a crowded grave-yard, he says:—\r\n\r\n  Similar symptoms are observable when the dead are kept any length of\r\n  time in crowded apartments. I well recollect a child dying, during\r\n  the summer months, of scarlet fever, and the parents persisted in\r\n  keeping the corpse for a considerable period, notwithstanding the\r\n  entreaties of the rest of the inmates to the contrary, all of whom\r\n  complained of being ill therefrom. The result was the production of\r\n  several cases of typhoid fever and much distress. A short time ago,\r\n  I was requested to attend a family consisting of five persons; they\r\n  resided in a room containing about 500 cubic feet, with but little\r\n  light and much less ventilation. One child was suffering from\r\n  small-pox, and died in a day or two: the corpse was allowed to\r\n  remain in the room. The two other children were soon attacked by the\r\n  disease, as well as a child belonging to a person residing in the\r\n  same house, who was imprudent enough to bring it into this\r\n  apartment, though cautioned not to do so. The stench arising from\r\n  the living and dead was so intolerable that it produced in myself\r\n  severe head-ache, and my friend, who accompanied me, complained of\r\n  sudden nervousness. The parents of these children (one of whom is\r\n  since dead) are suffering great debility.\r\n\r\n  The similarity of symptoms produced in these cases might perhaps\r\n  lead us to the conclusion that the cause was probably the same in\r\n  all; consequently, whether this poison be diluted or concentrated,\r\n  it should, at all times, be carefully avoided. For this purpose, I\r\n  should recommend the early removal of the dead from such apartments,\r\n  and a check to be put to the baneful practice of burying the dead so\r\n  near the surface in crowded districts.\r\n\r\n§ 31. The accounts given by the medical practitioners and persons who\r\nare chiefly in attendance on the parties before death, are corroborated\r\nby the evidence of undertakers and others engaged in providing goods and\r\nservices for the performance of the last rites for artisans of a\r\ncondition to defray the funeral expenses.\r\n\r\nMr. Wild, an undertaker, residing in the Blackfriars Road, London, who\r\ninters between 500 and 600 bodies annually, of which about 350 are of\r\nthe working classes, states, that the time during which the corpse is\r\nkept in the house varies from five to twelve days.\r\n\r\n  The greater proportion of the working men in London live and sleep\r\n  in one room only, do they not?—Three-fourths of the rooms we have to\r\n  visit are single rooms; the one room is the only room the poor\r\n  people have.\r\n\r\n  When you visit the room, in what condition do you find the corpse?\r\n  How is it laid out?—Generally speaking, we only find one bed in the\r\n  room, and that occupied by a corpse. It frequently happens that\r\n  there is no sacking to the bedding; when they borrow a board or a\r\n  shutter from a neighbour, in order to lay out the corpse upon it;\r\n  they have also to borrow other convenient articles necessary, such\r\n  us a sheet. The corpse of a child is usually laid out on the table.\r\n  The Irish poor have a peculiar mode of arranging the corpse; they\r\n  place candles around the bed, and they have a black cross placed at\r\n  the head of the bed.\r\n\r\n  Is the practice of keeping bodies in the place of abode for a long\r\n  time much altered in cases where the death has occurred from fever\r\n  or any contagious disease?—Very seldom; they would keep them much\r\n  longer if it were not for the undertaker, who urges them to bury\r\n  them. In cases of rapid decomposition of persons dying in full habit\r\n  there is much liquid; and the coffin is tapped to let it out. I have\r\n  known them to keep the corpse after the coffin had been tapped\r\n  twice, which has, of course, produced a disagreeable effluvium. This\r\n  liquid generates animal life very rapidly; and within six hours\r\n  after a coffin has been tapped, if the liquid escapes, maggots, or a\r\n  sort of animalculæ, are seen crawling about. I have frequently seen\r\n  them crawling about the floor of a room inhabited by the labouring\r\n  classes, and about the tressels on which the tapped coffin is\r\n  sustained. In such rooms the children are frequently left whilst the\r\n  widow is out making arrangements connected with the funeral. And the\r\n  widow herself lives there with the children. I frequently find them\r\n  altogether in a small room with a large fire.\r\n\r\n  Have you known instances of the spread of disease amongst the\r\n  members of the family residing in the same room where the corpse is\r\n  kept?—Some medical men have said that corpses of persons who have\r\n  contagious diseases are not dangerous; but my belief is, that in\r\n  cases of small-pox and scarlatina it is dangerous; and only the\r\n  other day a case of this nature occurred,—a little boy, who died of\r\n  the small-pox. Soon after he died, his sister, a little girl who had\r\n  been playing in the same room, was attacked with small-pox and died.\r\n  The medical attendant said, the child must have touched the corpse.\r\n  A poor woman, a neighbour, went over to see one of these bodies, and\r\n  was much afflicted and frightened, and I believe touched the body.\r\n  She was certainly attacked with the small-pox, and, after lingering\r\n  some time, died a few days since. The other day at Lambeth, the\r\n  eldest child of a person died of scarlet fever. The child was about\r\n  four years old; it had been ill a week. There were two other\r\n  children, one was three years old and the other sixteen months. When\r\n  the first child died there were no symptoms of illness for three\r\n  days afterwards, the corpse of the eldest was kept in the house;\r\n  here it was in a separate room, but the medical man recommended\r\n  early interment, and it was buried on the fourth day. The youngest\r\n  child had been taken by the servant into the room where the corpse\r\n  was, to see it, and this child was taken ill just before the burial\r\n  and died in about a week. The corpse of this child was retained in\r\n  the house three weeks. It is supposed that the other child had also\r\n  been taken into the room to see the corpse and touch it, and at the\r\n  end of the three weeks it also died. The medical attendant was\r\n  clearly of opinion that had the first child been early removed, it\r\n  would have been saved. The undertaker’s men who have to put into\r\n  coffins the corpses of persons who have died from any contagious\r\n  disease, are sometimes sick and compelled to take instantly gin or\r\n  brandy; and they will feel sickly for some hours after, but they are\r\n  not known to catch the disease. I have often heard the men say on\r\n  the morning following, “I have been able to take no breakfast\r\n  to-day,” and have complained of want of appetite for some time\r\n  after.\r\n\r\nMr. Jeffereys, an undertaker, residing in Whitechapel, gives a similar\r\naccount of the dreadful effects of this practice.\r\n\r\n  It is stated that the practice of keeping the body in the house is a\r\n  very great evil; how long have you known bodies to be kept in the\r\n  house before interment?—I have known them to be kept three weeks: we\r\n  every week see them kept until the bodies are nearly putrid:\r\n  sometimes they have run away almost through the coffin, and the poor\r\n  people, women and children, are living and sleeping in the same room\r\n  at the same time. In some cases there is superstition about the\r\n  interments, but it is not very frequent. Then when the corpse is\r\n  uncovered, or the coffin is open, females will hang over it. A widow\r\n  who hung over the body of her husband, caught the disease of which\r\n  he died. The doctor told her he knew she must have kissed or touched\r\n  the body: she died, leaving seven orphans, of whom four are now in\r\n  an orphan asylum. A young man died not long since, and his body\r\n  rapidly decomposed. His sister, a fine healthy girl, hung over the\r\n  corpse and kissed it; in three weeks after she died also.\r\n\r\n§ 32. The descriptions given by the labouring classes themselves of the\r\ncircumstances precedent to the removal of the body for interment, are\r\nsimilar to those in the instances above cited. They are thus described\r\nby John Downing, one of several respectable mechanics examined:—\r\n\r\n  You, as secretary [of a burial society] are called upon to attend\r\n  the funeral; are you not?—Yes, I am. It is part of our rules, also,\r\n  that the secretary shall see the body and identify it. When old\r\n  members, whom I have known, have been sick, I have visited them,\r\n  although I am not obliged to do it.\r\n\r\n  What in the case of death is the condition in which you generally\r\n  find the corpse?—It is generally stretched out on a shutter, with a\r\n  sheet over it. Children are generally laid out on the table.\r\n\r\n  In how many cases do you find that those whom you visit, who may\r\n  perhaps be considered to be of the class of respectable mechanics,\r\n  do you find them occupying more than one room?—About one case in\r\n  six.\r\n\r\n  Have you observed any effects from the long retention of the body in\r\n  the same room as the family?—Yes, I have known children to have\r\n  taken the disease and die; I have also known the widow who has hung\r\n  over the body and kissed it, become ill and die through it. I have\r\n  known other cases where there has been severe illness. I have myself\r\n  been made ill by visiting them; I have felt giddy in the head and\r\n  very sick, and have gone to the nearest house of refreshment to get\r\n  some brandy. I have felt the effects for two or three days.\r\n\r\n§ 33. The next class of witnesses, who receive the remains at the place\r\nof burial, attest the fact that the smell from the coffin is frequently\r\npowerfully offensive, and that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence\r\nthat the decomposing matter escapes from it, and in the streets, and in\r\nthe church, and in the church-yard, runs down over the shoulders of the\r\nbearers.\r\n\r\n§ 34. So far as the inquiry has proceeded in the provincial towns, it\r\nappears that the practice of keeping the corpse in the crowded living\r\nrooms does not differ essentially from the practice in the metropolis.\r\nMr. R. Craven, a surgeon residing at Leeds, who has had great experience\r\namongst that population, states—\r\n\r\n  The Irish almost universally live huddled together in great numbers\r\n  in a small space. I have often known as many as twenty human beings\r\n  lodged and fed in a dirty filthy cottage with only two rooms. Great\r\n  many live in cellar dwellings. I have frequently seen a cellar\r\n  dwelling lodge a family of seven to ten persons, and that in close\r\n  confined yards. I have seen a cellar dwelling in one of the most\r\n  densely-populated districts of Leeds in which were living seven\r\n  persons, with one corner fenced off and a pig in it; a ridge of clay\r\n  being placed round the fence to prevent the wet from the pigsty\r\n  running all over the floor, and to this cellar there was no\r\n  drainage.\r\n\r\n  I believe that a much larger proportion of the Irish attacked by\r\n  fever, die, than of English. Children they do not make so much\r\n  parade of, as here is greater difficulty of obtaining the funds for\r\n  their burial. It is no uncommon thing to see a corpse laid out in a\r\n  room where eight to twelve persons have to sleep, and sometimes even\r\n  both sleep and eat.\r\n\r\nHe also states also that—\r\n\r\n  Amongst the hand-loom weavers there is some difference. They\r\n  generally live in cottages consisting of two small rooms or cellar\r\n  dwellings; these have always a large space occupied by the loom; and\r\n  in cottages of two rooms I have frequently seen two families\r\n  residing having in the upper room two looms. When deaths occur in\r\n  this class the corpse cannot be laid out without occupying the space\r\n  where the family have to work (the father or mother weaving, and\r\n  children winding or rendering other assistance), or in the room\r\n  where they live and eat. This, I am of opinion, has a very debasing\r\n  effect on the morals of this class of the community, making\r\n  especially the rising generation so familiar with death that their\r\n  feelings are not hurt by it: it has also a very injurious physical\r\n  effect, frequently propagating disease in a rapid manner and to an\r\n  immense extent.\r\n\r\n§ 35. Mr. Christopher Fountaine Browne, one of the parochial surgeons of\r\nLeeds, whose district comprehends a population of 45,000 persons,\r\nchiefly of the working classes, states that:—\r\n\r\n  The people amongst whom I practise generally occupy one room where\r\n  they live in, and a bed-room above; but I have known many instances\r\n  of a family, say a man, his wife, and from three to six children,\r\n  having only one bed and one apartment for all purposes. But a great\r\n  many dwellings there consist of only one room, and in many of the\r\n  lodging-houses I have seen five or six beds in one small room, in\r\n  which it has been acknowledged that from 12 to 14 persons have\r\n  passed the night, and the air has been so bad that I have been\r\n  compelled to stand at the window whilst visiting the patient.\r\n\r\nHe also states, that—\r\n\r\n  He has seen many deaths take place in such houses when the body\r\n  remains in the bed where it died; and I have known it remain two or\r\n  three nights before interment. In Irish cases they keep them longer.\r\n  I have seen a child lie in a down-stairs room in a corner, dead of\r\n  small-pox, and another dying, and the house full of lodgers eating\r\n  their meals. The length of time that a corpse is kept varies very\r\n  much according to the disposition of the relatives and the means of\r\n  procuring a burial, as there are no restrictions as to the length of\r\n  time bodies are to be kept.\r\n\r\n  I have observed, that in cases of small-pox disease frequently\r\n  follows in rapid succession on different members of the same family.\r\n  I have frequently known cases of a low typhoid character arise where\r\n  many persons sleep in the same room: the addition of a death from\r\n  any such cause of course increases the danger to the living.\r\n\r\nIn Manchester and in several northern districts, it appears that by\r\ncustom the corpse seldom remains unburied more than three or four days,\r\nbut during that time it remains in the crowded rooms of the living of\r\nthe labouring classes. Every day’s retention of the corpse is to be\r\nconsidered an aggravation of the evil; but the evidence is to be borne\r\nin mind that the miasma from the dead is more dangerous immediately\r\nafter death, or during the first and second day, than towards the end of\r\nthe week. In a proportion of cases decomposition has commenced before\r\nthe vital functions have ceased; immediately after death decomposition\r\noften proceeds with excessive rapidity in the crowded rooms, which have\r\nthen commonly larger fires than usual.\r\n\r\n§ 36. It is observed by some of the witnesses that usually, and except\r\nby accident, and in few cases, the miasma from the remains of the dead\r\nin grave-yards can only reach the living in a state of diffusion and\r\ndilution; and that large proportions of it probably escape without\r\nproducing any immediately appreciable evil. The practice, however, of\r\nthe retention of the remains in the one room of the living brings the\r\neffluvium to bear directly upon the survivors when it is most dangerous,\r\nwhen they are usually exhausted bodily by watching, and depressed\r\nmentally by anxiety and grief—circumstances which it is well known\r\ngreatly increase the danger of contagion. The males of the\r\nworking-classes in general die earlier than the females, and in the\r\ngreater number of cases the last duties fall to the widow; and the\r\nprevalence of fatal disease chiefly amongst the children is frequently\r\nattributed to the circumstance, that she is aroused from the stunning\r\neffect of the bereavement by the necessity of going abroad and seeking\r\npecuniary aid, and making arrangements for the funeral, whilst the\r\nchildren are left at home in the house with the corpse.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, from an aversion to sleeping in the presence of the corpse,\r\nit is the practice to sit up with it, and there is then much drinking of\r\nardent spirits. Mr. W. Dyce Guthrie speaks strongly of the evils\r\nattendant upon the practice of the unguarded retention of the body under\r\nsuch circumstances, and of the instances known by himself where persons\r\nhave come from a distance to attend the funeral of a departed friend,\r\nand have returned infected with a disease similar to that which\r\nterminated the friend’s existence. The concurrent and decided opinion of\r\nhimself and a number of other medical witnesses is, that the public\r\nhealth is much more affected by the pestiferous influence of the corpse\r\nduring the interval of time that occurs from the moment of death, up to\r\nthe hour of the funeral, than it commonly is or can be after interment.\r\n\r\n§ 37. Of the deaths which take place in the metropolis, it will be seen\r\nthat more than one-half are the deaths of the labouring classes. The\r\nfollowing table, taken from the Mortuary Registries during the year\r\n1839, shows the numbers of deaths amongst the chief classes of society,\r\nand the proportions of deaths from epidemic diseases. At least four out\r\nof five of the deaths of the labouring classes, it will be remembered,\r\nare stated to occur in the single living and sleeping room, that is to\r\nsay, upwards of 20,000 annually.\r\n\r\n ───────────┬─────────────────────┬───────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────\r\n            │                     │       │         │Ratio of │\r\n            │                     │ Ratio │Number of│ Deaths  │ Average\r\n            │                     │  of   │ Deaths  │  from   │ Age at\r\n            │                     │Deaths │  from   │Epidemic,│Death of\r\n            │ Number of Deaths of │  of   │Epidemic,│Endemic, │the whole\r\n            │     each Class.     │ Chil- │Endemic, │   and   │ Class,\r\n            │                     │dren to│   and   │ Conta-  │including\r\n            │                     │ Total │ Conta-  │  gious  │  Chil-\r\n            │                     │Deaths.│  gious  │ Disease │  dren.\r\n            │                     │       │Diseases.│to Total │\r\n            │                     │       │         │ Deaths. │\r\n ───────────┼───────┬──────┬──────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n            │       │Chil- │      │       │         │         │\r\n            │       │ dren │      │       │         │         │\r\n            │Adults.│under │Total.│       │         │         │\r\n            │       │  10  │      │       │         │         │\r\n            │       │Years.│      │       │         │         │\r\n ───────────┼───────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n Gentry,    │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n   Profes-  │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n   sional   │  1,724│   529│ 2,253│   1 in│      210│     1 in│       44\r\n   Persons, │       │      │      │ 4–3/10│         │  10–7/10│\r\n   & their  │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n   Families │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n Tradesmen, │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n   Clerks, &│  3,979│ 3,703│ 7,682│   1 in│    1,428│     1 in│       25\r\n   their    │       │      │      │ 2–1/10│         │   5–4/10│\r\n   Families │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n Undescribed│  2,996│ 2,761│ 5,757│   1 in│    1,051│     1 in│       28\r\n            │       │      │      │ 2–1/10│         │   5–5/10│\r\n Labourers  │       │      │      │   1 in│         │     1 in│\r\n   and their│ 12,045│13,885│25,930│ 1–9/10│    5,469│   4–8/10│       22\r\n   Families │       │      │      │       │         │         │\r\n Paupers    │  3,062│   593│ 3,655│   1 in│      557│     1 in│       49\r\n            │       │      │      │ 6–2/10│         │   6–6/10│\r\n ───────────┼───────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼─────────┼─────────┼─────────\r\n    Total   │ 23,806│21,471│45,277│   1 in│    8,715│     1 in│       27\r\n            │       │      │      │ 2–1/10│         │   5–2/10│\r\n ───────────┴───────┴──────┴──────┴───────┴─────────┴─────────┴─────────\r\n\r\nIn making up this table, all who were not distinguished as master\r\ntradesmen were entered as mechanics. This circumstance would give to the\r\nlabouring classes an appearance of a higher average age of death than is\r\ngained by them. On the other hand, some of the labouring classes will be\r\nfound to have died in the workhouse, which would perhaps keep the\r\naverage where it now stands, whilst if the registration were more\r\naccurate, the average age of death of the middle classes might be found\r\nto be about 27. The average age of death of 27 given for the whole\r\nmetropolis is not made as an average of the averages, but from the\r\naverage of the whole. The apparent high average of the age of death of\r\npaupers arises from the smaller proportion of children amongst them: and\r\nthe larger proportion of aged adults who seek refuge in the\r\nworkhouse.[10]\r\n\r\n§ 38. The deaths registered from epidemic, endemic, and contagious\r\ndiseases during the year 1839, which was by no means an unhealthy year,\r\nwere as follows in Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Birmingham:—\r\n\r\n ─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────\r\n                  │                 │   Deaths from   │ Ratio of Deaths\r\n                  │ Total Number of │    Epidemic,    │  from Epidemic\r\n                  │     Deaths.     │  Endemic, and   │ Disease to the\r\n                  │                 │   Contagious    │ Total Number of\r\n                  │                 │    Diseases.    │     Deaths.\r\n ─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────\r\n Liverpool        │            7,435│            1,844│1 in 4\r\n Manchester       │            6,774│            2,006│1 in 3–4/10\r\n Leeds            │            4,388│              965│1 in 4–5/10\r\n Birmingham       │            3,639│              747│1 in 4–9/10\r\n ─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────\r\n\r\nThe numbers of deaths which occurred during that year amongst the\r\nlabouring classes are not distinguished, but they were for the next year\r\nas follows. And in the three first-named towns, I conceive that the\r\nproportion of cases of deaths amongst those classes where the corpse is\r\nkept in the living room, is in all probability as great as in the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\n                            Liverpool  5,597\r\n                            Manchester 4,629\r\n                            Leeds      3,395\r\n                            Birmingham 2,715\r\n\r\nI am unaware of any data existing in the towns in Scotland from which\r\nany estimate can be made of the extent to which the evils in question\r\nare prevalent there. In the recent Report on the Census, sufficient is\r\nshown of the condition of the labouring population in the towns in\r\nIreland to prove, that in them, the evils must fall with at least as\r\ngreat severity as they are described to occur in the worst, conditioned\r\ndistricts in England.[11]\r\n\r\n§ 39. If the returns and the statements of witnesses acquainted with the\r\ncrowded districts be correct, that four out of five families of the\r\nlabouring classes have each but one room, then every unit of upwards of\r\n20,000 deaths per annum which occur in the metropolis, every unit of\r\n4600 deaths of the labouring classes which occur annually at Liverpool,\r\nmust be taken as representing a horrible scene of the retention of the\r\ncorpse amidst the family in the manner described in the testimony of\r\nthose who have witnessed it;—and every unit of some 4000 deaths from\r\nepidemics in the metropolis, and every third or fourth recorded death in\r\nother towns, and even in crowded villages, represents a distressing\r\nscene, and moreover a case of peculiar danger and probable permanent\r\ninjury to the survivors amongst whom it takes place. Great, however, as\r\nmay be the physical evils to them, the evidence of the mental pain and\r\nmoral evil generally attendant on the practice of the long retention of\r\nthe body in the rooms in use and amidst the living, though only noticed\r\nincidentally, is yet more deplorable.\r\n\r\n§ 40. The duty which attaches to male relations, or which a benevolent\r\npastor, if there were the accommodation, would exercise on the\r\noccurrence of the calamity of death to any member of a family, is to\r\nremove the sensitive and the weakly from the spectacle, which is a\r\nperpetual stimulus to excessive grief, and commonly a source of painful\r\nassociations and visible images of the changes wrought in death, to\r\nhaunt the imagination in after-life. When the dissolution has taken\r\nplace under circumstances such as those described, it is not a few\r\nminutes’ look after the last duties are performed and the body is\r\ncomposed in death and left in repose, that is given to this class of\r\nsurvivors, but the spectacle is protracted hour after hour through the\r\nday and night, and day after day, and night after night, thus\r\naggravating the mental pains under varied circumstances, and increasing\r\nthe dangers of permanent bodily injury. The sufferings of the survivors,\r\nespecially of the widow of the labouring classes, are often protracted\r\nto a fatal extent. To the very young children, the greatest danger is of\r\ninfection in cases of deaths from contagious and infectious disease. To\r\nthe elder children and members of the family and inmates, the moral evil\r\ncreated by the retention of the body in their presence beyond the short\r\nterm during which sorrow and depression of spirits may be said to be\r\nnatural to them is, that familiarity soon succeeds, and respect\r\ndisappears. These consequences are revealed by the frequency of the\r\nstatements of witnesses, that the deaths of children immediately\r\nfollowing, of the same disease of which the parent had died, had been\r\naccounted for by “the doctor,” or the neighbours, in the probability\r\nthat the child had caught the disease by touching the corpse or the\r\ncoffin, whilst playing about the room in the absence of the mother. Dr.\r\nReicke, in the course of his dissertation on the physical dangers from\r\nexposure to emanations from the remains, mentions an instance where a\r\nlittle child having struck the body of the parent which had died of a\r\nmalignant disease, the hand and arm of the child was dangerously\r\ninflamed with malignant pustules in consequence. The mental effects on\r\nthe elder children or members of the family of the retention of the body\r\nin the living room, day after day, and during meal times, until\r\nfamiliarity is induced,—retained, as the body commonly is, during all\r\nthis time in the _sordes_ of disease, the progress of change and\r\ndecomposition disfiguring the remains and adding disgust to\r\nfamiliarity,—are attested to be of the most demoralizing character. Such\r\ndeaths occur sooner or later in various forms in every poor family; and\r\nin neighbourhoods where there are no sanitary regulations, where they\r\nare ravaged by epidemics, such scenes are doubly familiar to the whole\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n§ 41. Astonishment is frequently excited by the cases which abound in\r\nour penal records indicative of the prevalence of habits of savage\r\nbrutality and carelessness of life amongst the labouring population; but\r\ncrimes, like sores, will commonly be found to be the result of wider\r\ninfluences than are externally manifest; and the reasons for such\r\nastonishment, will be diminished in proportion as those circumstances\r\nare examined, which influence the minds and habits of the population\r\nmore powerfully than precepts or book education. Among these\r\ndemoralizing circumstances, which appear to be preventible or removable,\r\nare those which the present inquiry brings to light. Disrespect for the\r\nhuman form under suffering, indifference or carelessness at death,—or at\r\nthat destruction which follows as an effect of suffering—is rarely found\r\namongst the uneducated, unconnected with a callousness to others’ pain,\r\nand a recklessness about life itself. A known effect on uneducated\r\nsurvivors of the frequency of death amongst youth or persons in the\r\nvigour of life, is to create a reckless avidity for immediate enjoyment.\r\nSome examples of the demoralization attendant on such circumstances\r\ncannot but be apparent in the evidence arising in the course of this\r\ninquiry into other practices connected with interments.\r\n\r\n§ 42. On submitting the above to a friend, a clergyman, whose\r\nbenevolence has carried him to alleviate the sufferings in several\r\nhundred death-bed scenes in the abodes of the labouring classes, and who\r\nhas been present, perhaps, at every death in his own flock, in a\r\nwretchedly crowded parish, he writes in the following terms his\r\nconfirmation:—\r\n\r\n“The whole of this I can testify, from personal knowledge, to be just.\r\nWith the upper classes, a corpse excites feelings of awe and respect;\r\nwith the lower orders, in these districts, it is often treated with as\r\nlittle ceremony as the carcase in a butcher’s shop. Nothing can exceed\r\ntheir desire for an imposing funeral; nothing can surpass their efforts\r\nto obtain it; but the deceased’s remains share none of the reverence\r\nwhich this anxiety for their becoming burial would seem to indicate. The\r\ninconsistency is entirely, or at least in great part, to be attributed\r\nto a single circumstance—that the body is never absent from their\r\nsight—eating, drinking, or sleeping, it is still by their side; mixed up\r\nwith all the ordinary functions of daily life, till it becomes as\r\nfamiliar to them as when it lived and moved in the family circle. From\r\nfamiliarity it is a short step to desecration. The body, stretched out\r\nupon two chairs, is pulled about by the children, made to serve as a\r\nresting-place for any article that is in the way, and is not seldom the\r\nhiding-place for the beer-bottle or the gin if any visitor arrives\r\ninopportunely. Viewed as an outrage upon human feeling, this is bad\r\nenough; but who does not see that when the respect for the dead, that\r\nis, for the human form in its most awful stage, is gone, the whole mass\r\nof social sympathies must be weakened—perhaps blighted and destroyed? At\r\nany rate, it removes that wholesome fear of death which is the last hold\r\nupon a hardened conscience. They have gazed upon it so perpetually, they\r\nhave grown so intimate with its terrors, that they no longer dread it,\r\neven when it attacks themselves, and the heart which vice has deadened\r\nto every appeal of religion is at last rendered callous to the natural\r\ninstinct of fear.”\r\n\r\nThat it is possible by legislative means to stay the progress of this\r\ndreadful demoralization, which must, if no further heed be taken of it,\r\ngo on with the increased crowding of an increasing population; that it\r\nis possible to abate the mental and physical suffering; to extend to the\r\ndepressed urban districts an acceptable and benign and elevating\r\ninfluence on such impressive occasions; may be confidently affirmed, and\r\nwill in a subsequent stage of this Report be endeavoured to be shown by\r\nreference to actual examples of successful measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Expenses of Funerals and their effects on the Living._\r\n\r\n§ 43. The practice of the long retention of the dead before burial being\r\nthe one from which the greatest evil accrues, the circumstances by which\r\nthe practice is chiefly influenced are the first submitted for\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe causes which influence this practice amongst the greatest number of\r\nthe population appear to be, first, the expense of funerals—next, the\r\ndelay in making arrangements for the funeral,—the natural reluctance to\r\npart with the remains of the deceased, and occasionally a feeling of\r\napprehension, sometimes expressed on the part of the survivors, against\r\npremature interment.\r\n\r\nThe expense of interments, though it falls with the greatest severity on\r\nthe poorest classes, acts as a most severe infliction on the middle\r\nclasses of society, and governs so powerfully the questions in respect\r\nto the present and future administrative arrangements, and involves so\r\nmany other evils, as to require as complete an exposition as possible of\r\nits extent and operation.\r\n\r\nThe testimony of witnesses of the most extensive experience is of the\r\nfollowing tenor in London and the crowded town districts of England. Mr.\r\nByles, the surgeon, of Spitalfields, in reference to the delay of\r\ninterments, states—\r\n\r\n  The difficulty of raising the subscription to bury the dead, is I\r\n  apprehend one chief cause of the delay. When, in the instance of the\r\n  death of a child, I ask why it cannot be interred earlier, the usual\r\n  reply is, we cannot raise the money earlier.\r\n\r\nMr. Wild, the undertaker, states—\r\n\r\n  The time varies from five to twelve days. This arises from the\r\n  difficulty of procuring the means of making arrangements with the\r\n  undertaker, and the difficulty of getting mourners to attend the\r\n  funeral. They have a great number to attend, neighbours,\r\n  fellow-workmen, as well as relations. The mourners with them vary\r\n  from five to eight couple; it is always an agreement for five couple\r\n  at the least.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses of the labouring classes, who had acted as\r\nsecretary to an extensive burial society, gives the following account of\r\nthe causes which operate to produce the delay.\r\n\r\n  What is the average length of time they remain unburied?—Never less\r\n  than a week. If they die in the middle of the week they are\r\n  generally kept until the Sunday week. I have known instances,\r\n  however, where they have been kept as long as a fortnight.\r\n\r\n  What have been the causes of this retention of the body?—In general\r\n  it has been the want of money to defray the dues. In some cases,\r\n  however, the widow has been reluctant to part with the corpse.\r\n\r\n  In what proportion of cases has this occurred?—It may have been in\r\n  one case in thirty, as far as I can recollect.\r\n\r\n§ 44. Mr. Baker, the coroner, stated to me that he has met with some\r\ncases where inquests have been promoted in consequence of suspicions\r\nexcited amongst neighbours on account of the delay of interments; it\r\nturned out that the deaths had been natural, and that the delay had\r\narisen from the difficulty of procuring money to defray the funeral\r\nexpenses. Mr. Bell, who for several years acted as clerk to Mr.\r\nStirling, the late coroner for Middlesex, even cites several dreadful\r\ncases of children found dead in the metropolis, in which, on inquiry, it\r\nwas proved that the deaths were natural, but that the bodies had been\r\nactually abandoned in consequence of the difficulty of raising the money\r\nfor interment, and the reluctance to apply for parochial aid.\r\n\r\n§ 45. The nature of the expenses of interments in London, and their\r\noperation on the whole practice, are most fully developed in the\r\nexamination of Mr. Wild.\r\n\r\n  Supposing the expenses of interment reduced, and the conveniences\r\n  increased, do you think that there would be much or any reluctance\r\n  to early interment, on account of any general feeling of dislike on\r\n  the part of the survivors to earlier removals or interments?—No, I\r\n  do not think there would be any reluctance.\r\n\r\n  In cases where the obstacles arising from the expense and the\r\n  inconvenience preventing the attendance of friends do not exist, is\r\n  there a frequent reluctance expressed to early interment?—It is not\r\n  frequent. Sometimes, but very seldom, the deceased may have\r\n  expressed a wish not to be hurried out of the house soon after he\r\n  was dead.\r\n\r\n  Do you find that there is less delay amongst the higher and middle\r\n  classes?—There is certainly much less delay amongst them; but with\r\n  them the corpses are early placed either in lead or in double\r\n  coffins, and the delay is of less consequence.\r\n\r\n  Amongst the poorer classes, is not the widow often made ill during\r\n  the protracted delay of the burial?—Yes, very often. They have come\r\n  to me in tears, and begged for accommodation, which I have given\r\n  them. On observing to them, you seem very ill: a common reply is,\r\n  “Yes, I feel very ill. I am very much harassed, and I have no one to\r\n  assist me.” I infer from such expressions that the mental anxiety\r\n  occasioned by the expense, and want of means to obtain the money, is\r\n  the frequent cause of their illness. My opinion is, that unless the\r\n  undertaker gave two-thirds of them time or accommodation for\r\n  payment, they would not be able to bury the dead at all.\r\n\r\n  Do you consider that funerals in general are made unnecessarily\r\n  expensive?—Yes, they are, even under their present system\r\n  unnecessarily expensive. The average price of funerals amongst the\r\n  working classes for adults will be about 4_l._ This sum generally\r\n  provides a good strong elm coffin, bearers to carry the corpse to\r\n  the grave, pall and fittings for mourners. For children the average\r\n  cost is 30_s._, but these charges do not include ground and burial\r\n  fees.\r\n\r\n  Are they so even when the funerals are provided by burial societies,\r\n  and made the subject of special attention?—In benefit societies and\r\n  burial clubs there is generally a certain sum set aside for the\r\n  burial, which sum is, I consider, frequently most extravagantly\r\n  expended. This arises from the secretary, or some other officer of\r\n  the club being an undertaker. When a death takes place the club\r\n  money is not paid directly: it is usually paid on the club or\r\n  quarterly night following. The member dying seldom leaves any money\r\n  beyond the provision in his club to bury him, consequently the widow\r\n  or nominee makes application to the secretary, who tells her that he\r\n  cannot give any money to purchase mourning for herself and family\r\n  until the committee meets; this may be three months after the death;\r\n  but, says the secretary, “give me the funeral, I will advance you a\r\n  few pounds upon my own account;” so that the widow is obliged to\r\n  submit to any charge he may think fit to make. I do not mean to be\r\n  understood that this is always the case—I am sorry to say it is of\r\n  frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n  In general, are not the expenses of burial in the Dissenters’\r\n  burial-grounds less than those of burial in the grounds belonging to\r\n  the Established Church?—On the average one-third less.\r\n\r\n  On the occasion of burial in Dissenters’ burial-grounds, is any\r\n  question ever raised as to whether the deceased was a subscribing\r\n  member of the community to which the grounds belong?—No question is\r\n  ever asked.\r\n\r\n  Of corpses of the labouring classes whom you yourself have buried in\r\n  the burial-grounds of Dissenters, how many will have been of\r\n  subscribing members of the community to which the grounds\r\n  belong?—Not one in twenty.\r\n\r\n  Then the preference arises from the greater cheapness of the burial\r\n  in those grounds?—Yes, and the greater convenience. The burial,\r\n  instead of being fixed at one particular hour, as in cases of\r\n  burials in the Church, may be had within a range of three hours.\r\n  This convenience has a great influence on the choice of places of\r\n  burial.\r\n\r\n  Have burials in the Dissenters’ grounds been increasing of\r\n  late?—Very much: their places of burial are in general no better;\r\n  they are, indeed, in some instances worse than the grounds belonging\r\n  to the parish churches, but they would, probably, have enlarged and\r\n  improved them, and, at the rate at which they have proceeded, they\r\n  would soon have three-fourths of all the burials;—chiefly on account\r\n  of the increased cheapness and accommodation attendant on their\r\n  burials.\r\n\r\n  Are the ordinary expenses and inconveniences of funerals generally\r\n  severely oppressive to persons of the middle classes?—Very\r\n  generally: it often occurs that a poor widow is crippled in her\r\n  means through life by the expense of a funeral. An ordinary funeral,\r\n  burial fees and all, will cost from 50_l._ to 70_l._, which will\r\n  deprive her of 5_l._ a year from ten to fourteen years, besides the\r\n  interest.\r\n\r\n  Without any deductions of the solemnity, for how much less might\r\n  such a funeral be performed?—For about 50 per cent. less. Indeed, I\r\n  have proved that practically for some time past.\r\n\r\n  Is not much of the accompaniments of funerals which, as at present\r\n  conducted, are deemed part of the solemnity, questionable in its\r\n  effect as well as appropriateness? Is it not the effect of custom,\r\n  rather than any choice or wish of the parties?—Merely customary: the\r\n  term used in giving orders is, “provide what is customary.”\r\n\r\n  Are you aware that the array of funerals, commonly made by\r\n  undertakers, is strictly the heraldic array of a baronial funeral,\r\n  the two men who stand at the doors being supposed to be the two\r\n  porters of the castle, with their staves, in black; the man who\r\n  heads the procession, wearing a scarf, being a representative of a\r\n  herald-at-arms; the man who carries a plume of feathers on his head\r\n  being an esquire, who bears the shield and casque, with its plume of\r\n  feathers; the pall-bearers, with batons, being representatives of\r\n  knights-companions-at-arms; the men walking with wands being\r\n  supposed to represent gentlemen-ushers, with their wands:—are you\r\n  aware that this is said to be the origin and type of the common\r\n  array usually provided by those who undertake to perform\r\n  funerals?—No; I am not aware of it.\r\n\r\n  It may be presumed that those who order funerals are equally unaware\r\n  of the incongruity for which such expense is incurred?—Undoubtedly\r\n  they are.\r\n\r\n  What is the cost of porters, the men who bear staves covered with\r\n  black?—The cost of the mutes varies from 18_s._ to 30_s._ In some\r\n  cases of respectable persons, where silk scarfs or fittings,\r\n  including hat-bands and gloves, are used, 5_l._ 5_s._ is charged to\r\n  families for those fittings. To parties in moderate circumstances,\r\n  two guineas would be charged for the fittings and the pay.\r\n\r\n  What is the charge for the person who walks with a scarf?—The usual\r\n  charge to a respectable family would be a guinea, besides fittings,\r\n  scarfs, gloves, and hat-bands, which would altogether amount to\r\n  about two guineas and a half for this man.\r\n\r\n  What is the charge for the plume of feathers borne on the head\r\n  before the hearse?—The charge for the feathers would be about two\r\n  guineas; then there is the man’s gloves, scarf, and fittings, which\r\n  make it about three guineas and a-half.\r\n\r\n  What is the charge per man bearing batons?—The charge, including\r\n  silk fittings, will be about 22_s._ each man.\r\n\r\n  What is the charge for each man bearing a wand?—About the same\r\n  price.\r\n\r\n  How many men of this description would be required for what is\r\n  deemed a respectable funeral?—About twenty men; for if the coffin be\r\n  a leaden one it would require about eight men to bear it.\r\n\r\n  What other charges are there of the same kind?—There are velvets\r\n  attached to the hearse, including feathers, and feathers to the\r\n  horses, which makes from ten to fifteen guineas more.\r\n\r\n  What is charged for the pall?—From one to four guineas would be\r\n  charged for the use of the pall.\r\n\r\n  What is it usual to give to the clergyman?—A silk scarf of three\r\n  yards and a half, a silk hatband, and black kid gloves.\r\n\r\n  What may be the expense of this?—About two guineas to the parties.\r\n\r\n  Is anything usually given to the clerk?—Yes, the same as to the\r\n  minister.\r\n\r\n  Is anything given to the sexton?—Yes, they do in respectable\r\n  families, or rather the undertaker does so, for his own gain. The\r\n  cost of the whole,—minister, sexton, and undertaker, will be about\r\n  seven guineas to a respectable family, but it is usual to compound\r\n  the matter by giving them money; I generally give the minister\r\n  18_s._, and the clerk 15_s._, and the sexton, perhaps, 15_s._\r\n\r\n  Is such an array as that described adopted in the case of the\r\n  funerals of tradesmen as well as of other classes?—They have\r\n  frequently the same number of men.\r\n\r\n  A clergyman’s widow, who has solicited aid for her sons, whom she\r\n  has found it difficult to educate, states that the expenses of her\r\n  husband’s funeral were upwards of 110_l._ On being asked how she\r\n  could incur such an expense, she states that she considered it her\r\n  duty to have a respectable funeral, and ordered the undertaker to\r\n  provide what was respectable; that she knew not what she ordered in\r\n  that condition, and merely gave general orders. Now is not this a\r\n  frequent case, and is not the undertaker’s usual interpretation of\r\n  respectability that which is expensive, the parties knowing little\r\n  about it?—Yes, that is frequently so.\r\n\r\n  In the case of funerals of persons of moderate respectability\r\n  costing, say about 60_l._, how many of such men as those described\r\n  would there be attending it?—About fourteen.\r\n\r\n  For a curate, or person of that condition, would there be that\r\n  number and array?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  What would be the expense of the funeral of a person of the\r\n  condition of an attorney?—From 60_l._ to 100_l._; but this would not\r\n  include the expense of tomb or monument, or burial-fees.\r\n\r\n  If a person of such a condition were buried, would it be of about\r\n  twenty attendants, with such an array as that described?—Yes; for\r\n  such a person the cost would be about 100 guineas, exclusive of the\r\n  burial-fees.\r\n\r\n  There would then be the same number of attendants as those\r\n  mentioned, about twenty men?—Yes, about twenty men.\r\n\r\n  The funeral being ordered of an upholsterer, is it not usually\r\n  provided by an undertaker?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  In how many cases of funerals will there be “the second profit?”—In\r\n  nearly two-thirds of the cases of burial in the upper classes.\r\n\r\n  Is the same observation applicable to the funerals amongst the\r\n  middle classes?—Yes; I think in nearly the same proportion.\r\n\r\n  How much of the profit will be the profit of the upholsterer?—Nearly\r\n  half: if the funeral costs 50_l._ to the upholsterer from the\r\n  undertaker, it will cost about 100_l._ from the undertaker to the\r\n  family.\r\n\r\n  Is there much credit given in the business to respectable\r\n  families?—Not much; for as soon as letters of administration are\r\n  taken out the funeral expenses are discharged.\r\n\r\n  The average expense of the funeral of an adult of the labouring\r\n  class being about 4_l._, exclusive of the burial fees, and that of a\r\n  child about 30_s._, what may be stated to be the ordinary expense of\r\n  the funeral of a tradesman of the lowest class, as ordinarily\r\n  conducted?—Of the very lowest class—of a class in condition not much\r\n  beyond that of a mechanic, the funeral expenses might be from 10_l._\r\n  to 12_l._\r\n\r\n  What would be the ordinary expense for the funeral of a child of a\r\n  person of this class?—The ordinary expense would be about 5_l._\r\n\r\n  What would be the ordinary expense of the funeral of a tradesman of\r\n  a better class?—From 70_l._ to 100_l._\r\n\r\n  What do you consider would be a low average for the ordinary expense\r\n  of the whole class of tradesmen’s funerals?—About 50_l._ would, I\r\n  consider, be a low average for the whole class.\r\n\r\n  What may be considered the average of ordinary expenses of the\r\n  funerals of children of the class dying below 10 years of age?—About\r\n  14_l._\r\n\r\n  Might 100_l._ be taken as the average expense of the funeral of a\r\n  person of the condition of a gentleman?—No; they range from 200_l._\r\n  to 1,000_l._ I think that 150_l._ would be a low average.\r\n\r\n  What may be considered the ordinary expense of the funeral of a\r\n  child of this class?—About 30_l._ would be the average.\r\n\r\n  What may be the ordinary expense of the funerals of persons of rank\r\n  or title?—The expense varies from 500_l._ to 1500_l._ A large part\r\n  of this expense has, however, commonly been for the removal of the\r\n  remains from town to the family vault by a long cavalcade moving by\r\n  very slow stages; but the conveyance by railway makes as much as\r\n  500_l._ difference in the expense of a funeral of this class.\r\n\r\n  What may be the average expense of the funeral of a child of this\r\n  class?—About 50_l._\r\n\r\n  Do you believe it to be practicable, by proper regulations, greatly\r\n  to reduce the existing charges of interments?—Yes; a very great\r\n  reduction indeed may be made, at least 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n  May it be confidently stated that under such reductions, whatever of\r\n  respectability in exterior is now attached to the trappings, or to\r\n  the mode of the ceremony, might be preserved?—Oh, yes; I should say\r\n  it might, and that they could scarcely fail to be increased.\r\n\r\n§ 46. Mr. Dix, an undertaker, who inters from 800 to 1000 persons\r\nannually, of whom about 300 are of the class of independent labourers,\r\nbeing questioned on this topic, stated as follows:—\r\n\r\n  The lowest average expense of a poor man’s burial, from extensive\r\n  evidence, is stated to be about 5_l._; but that is where it is done,\r\n  as it usually is, second or third hand. I frequently perform\r\n  funerals three deep: that is, I do it for one person, who does it\r\n  for another who does it for the relatives of the deceased, he being\r\n  the first person applied to.\r\n\r\n  The people then generally apply to the nearest person?—Yes, they do.\r\n  Everybody calls himself an undertaker. The numerous men employed as\r\n  bearers become undertakers, although they have never done anything\r\n  until they have got the job. I have known one of these men get a new\r\n  suit of clothes out of the funeral of one decent mechanic.\r\n\r\n§ 47. The conclusions in respect to the unnecessary expense of funerals\r\nappear to be applicable, with little variation, to the most populous\r\nprovincial towns. In the rural districts the expense of funerals of the\r\nclass of gentry appears to be even more expensive. In most of the\r\nprovincial towns the expense of the funerals of the more respectable\r\nclass of tradesmen does not appear to be much less than in London. In\r\nScotland, the expenses of the funerals of persons of the middle classes\r\nappear, from a communication from Mr. Chambers, to vary from 12_l._ to\r\n25_l._ In Glasgow the expenses of funerals of persons of the middle\r\nclass appear to vary from 12_l._ to 50_l._\r\n\r\n§ 48. To persons of the condition of the widows of officers in the army\r\nor navy, or of the legal profession, or of persons of the rank of gentry\r\nwho have but limited incomes, the expenses of the funerals often subject\r\nthem to severe privations during the remainder of their lives. The widow\r\nis frequently compelled to beg pecuniary assistance for the education of\r\nher children, which the superfluous expenses of the funerals of the\r\nadult members of the family would have supplied; and these expenses are\r\nincurred often in utter disregard of express requests of the dying, that\r\nthe funerals should be plain, and divested of unnecessary expense. The\r\nexpenses are often incurred equally against the wishes of the survivors.\r\nThe cause of this appears to be that the funeral arrangements, and the\r\ndetermination of what is proper, and what customs shall be maintained,\r\nfall, as shown by the evidence, to those who have a direct interest,—and\r\nwhen the nature of their separate establishments are considered, are\r\ncommonly acting under a strong necessity,—in maintaining a system of\r\nprofuse expenditure. The circumstances of the death do not admit of any\r\neffective competition or any precedent examination of the charges of\r\ndifferent undertakers, or any comparison and consideration of their\r\nsupplies; there is no time to change them for others that are less\r\nexpensive, and more in conformity to the taste and circumstances of the\r\nparties. An executor who had ordered a coffin and service of the “most\r\nsimple description,” conformably to the intentions of the deceased,\r\nexpecting the coffin to cost not more than five pounds, having, under\r\npeculiar circumstances, occasion to call for the bill previously to the\r\ninterment, found, to his surprise, that instead of five the charge for\r\nthe coffin amounted to nearly twenty pounds. “What,” he says, “could be\r\ndone? we could not turn the body out of the coffin: I would have paid\r\ndouble rather than have disturbed the peace of the house on that solemn\r\noccasion, by a dispute, or by an objection either to that charge, or to\r\nthe disgusting frippery with which those who attended the dead were\r\ncovered against their tastes.” The survivors, however, are seldom in a\r\nstate to perform any office of every-day life; and they are at the mercy\r\nof the first comer. The supplies of the funeral goods and services, are,\r\ntherefore, a multiform monopoly, not apparently on the parts of the\r\nchief undertakers, or original and real preparers of the funeral\r\nmaterials and services, but of second or third parties living in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood,—persons who assume the business of an\r\nundertaker, and who obtain the first orders. The reason why the charges\r\nare seldom or ever disputed after interment is that, however severe or\r\nextortionate they may be, it would be more severe for the widow, or\r\nsurvivor, or friends, to scrutinise the items, or resist the payment of\r\nthe total amount. Nor can it be expected of any individual to break\r\nthrough such customs, however generally they may be disliked. All\r\nisolated efforts to simplify the supplies and use of the goods and\r\n_materiel_,—all objections to the demands for them are exposed to the\r\ncalumny that proper respect to the deceased is begrudged. A late right\r\nreverend bishop, who thought it a moral duty to resist an extortionate\r\ncharge for such service, and he did so even in a court of law,—the\r\nwell-intended, but isolated effort, was fruitless. Another reason for\r\nthe impunity of the extortion is, that much of the funeral expenses are\r\nfrom trust-funds of the higher and middle classes, who influence the\r\npractice of the lower classes; and the trustees have but weak motives\r\nand means to defend them. In so far as the funeral expenses are\r\nconcerned, such funds, as will appear in respect to the funds raised for\r\nburial amongst the labouring classes, are an exposed prey.\r\n\r\n§ 49. If there be any sort of service, which principles of civic polity,\r\nand motives of ordinary benevolence and charity, require to be placed\r\nunder public regulation, for the protection of the private individual\r\nwho is helpless, it is surely this, at the time of extreme misery and\r\nhelplessness of the means of decent interment. On inspecting the\r\ncondition of the whole class of persons engaged in the performance of\r\nthe service of undertakers, it may be confidently stated that the class\r\nwho only act as agents, could not suffer, and must gain morally and\r\nsocially, and ultimately pecuniarily by a change that would be\r\nbeneficial to the public. No class can be otherwise than benefited by\r\nchange, from an occupation in which they are kept waiting and dependent\r\non profits which fall to them at wide and irregular intervals.\r\nNotwithstanding the immensely disproportionate profits of these persons\r\nin some cases, and the immense aggregate expenditure to the public,\r\nthere appear to be very few wealthy undertakers. They are described by\r\none of them, “as being some few of them very respectable, but the great\r\nmajority as men mostly in a small grubbing way of business.” In this\r\ntrade we have now the means of knowing to an unit, from the mortuary\r\nregistration, the amount of service required; and we have some means of\r\nobtaining a proximate estimate of the number of persons engaged in its\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n§ 50. The number of deaths per diem in the metropolis (inclusive of the\r\ndeath of those who die in the workhouses, whose interment being provided\r\nfor by the parish and union officers, are not cases for every-day\r\ncompetition) is on an average of three years 114. The number of persons\r\nwhose sole business is that of undertakers, whose names are enumerated\r\nin the Post-office Directory for the year 1843 for the metropolis is\r\n275. Besides these there are 258 “undertakers and carpenters,” 34\r\n“undertakers and upholsterers,” 56 “undertakers and cabinet-makers,” 51\r\n“undertakers and builders,” 25 “undertakers and appraisers,” 19\r\n“undertakers and auctioneers,” 7 “undertakers and house-agents,” 3\r\n“undertakers and fancy cabinet-makers,” 2 “undertakers and packing-case\r\nmakers;” making in all no less than 730 persons for the 114 deaths, or\r\nbetween six and seven undertakers waiting for the chance of every\r\nprivate funeral. But these are masters who, whether they act as agents\r\nor principals, have shops and establishments, and the list does not\r\ninclude the whole of them, as the Directory is not understood to include\r\nall the masters residing in bye-streets and places. Some have two and\r\nthree funerals per diem, and some eight or ten; and it is apparent, even\r\nunder the existing imperfect arrangements, the undertaker’s service\r\nmight be better performed by forty or fifty than by the 275 principals,\r\nwho have no other occupation, and whose establishments and expenses, as\r\nwell as the cost of their own maintenance, must, if the business be\r\nequally distributed, be charged on little more than two funerals a-week.\r\nIf the business be not equally distributed, and a minority have (as will\r\nhave been perceived) a much larger share of the funerals than the rest,\r\nthe majority will be the more severely driven, as they are in fact, to\r\ncharge their expenses on a much smaller number of funerals. When the\r\nadditional number of tradesmen of mixed occupations are brought as\r\nwaiters for the chances of employment, the number of burials distributed\r\namongst them all is reduced to 10 funerals to every master in 11 weeks,\r\nor less than one a-week each. It is stated, that much larger numbers\r\nthan are named in the Directory retain the insignia of undertakers in\r\ntheir shop-windows, for the sake of the profits of one or two funerals\r\na-year. They merely transmit the orders to the furnishing undertaker,\r\nwho supplies materials and men at a comparatively low rate; and it is\r\nstated that the real service is rendered by about sixty tradesmen of\r\nthis class, who compete with each other in furnishing the supplies to a\r\nmultitude of inferior tradesmen, probably exceeding 1000, amongst whom\r\nthe excessive profits arising from extortionate charges are thus\r\nirregularly distributed. The profits of these agents or second parties\r\nare often, however, divided with others by the system (which pursues the\r\nhead of the family to the last) of corrupting servants for their “good\r\nword” or influence by bribes or allowances, against which the only\r\neffectual defence is care to secure purchases at prices so low as to\r\npreclude them. Physicians of great eminence have expressed their horror\r\nat the facts of which they have been informed, of large sums of money\r\nhaving been promised and given to head servants to secure to the\r\nparticular tradesman the performance of the funeral. The undertakers who\r\nwere questioned on the subject admitted explicitly that such is “an\r\noccasional but not an universal practice,” and that such sums as 10_l._,\r\n20_l._, and even 50_l._, have been known to have been given for such\r\norders, according to the scale of expense and profit of the funeral. One\r\nundertaker stated that whenever a medical man took the trouble to bring\r\nhim an order for a funeral, he always, as a matter of course, paid him a\r\nfee; and he believed it was a common practice. It was, however, only the\r\ninferior practitioners who brought these orders. Physicians usually\r\ncarefully abstain from giving any recommendations of tradesmen in such\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n§ 51. Such being the state of the service as respects the multitude of\r\nprincipals; the state of the service as respects the inferior dependents\r\nis, that as at present conducted it is, as far as it goes, demoralizing.\r\nThe journeymen, who form the superfluous retinue of attendants for whom\r\nso much expense is incurred, gain very little by their extravagant pay.\r\n“They are,” says one master undertaker, “kept long waiting, and are\r\ntaken away to a distance from their homes, and are put to great expense\r\nin drinking at public-houses, and acquiring very bad habits.” The\r\naccounts given by undertakers themselves of the conduct of the men\r\ncomposing the hired retinue of funerals, as at present conducted, are\r\ncorroborative of the following instance given by a gentleman who was a\r\nwitness of the scene described:—\r\n\r\n  “If the relatives of one who has been honoured with what is called a\r\n  respectable funeral could witness the scenes which commonly ensue,\r\n  even at the very place where the last ceremony has been performed,\r\n  they would be scandalized at the mockery of solemnity which has\r\n  preceded the disgusting indecency exhibited at the instant when the\r\n  mourners are removed. An empty hearse, returning at a quick pace\r\n  from a funeral, with half a dozen red-faced fellows sitting with\r\n  their legs across the pegs which held the feathers, is a common\r\n  exhibition. But let the relatives see what has preceded the ride\r\n  home of the undertaker’s men. In the spring of 1842, two friends\r\n  walked into a village inn about twelve miles from London, for the\r\n  purpose of dining. One had recently sustained a severe domestic\r\n  calamity. The inn is generally distinguished for its neatness and\r\n  quiet. All now seemed confusion. The travellers were shown up-stairs\r\n  to a comfortable room. But the shouts, the laughing, the rapping the\r\n  tables, the ringing the bells, in an adjoining room were beyond\r\n  endurance; and when the landlady appeared with her bill of fare, she\r\n  apologized for what was so different from the ordinary habit of her\r\n  guests. “Is it a club feast?” “Oh, no, gentlemen; they are the\r\n  undertaker’s men—blackguards I should say. They have been burying\r\n  poor Lord——; he was much beloved here. Shame on them. But they will\r\n  soon go back to town, for they are nearly drunk.” The travellers\r\n  left the house till it was cleared of these harpies.”\r\n\r\n§ 52. Men of the class who are every day to be seen stopping in parties\r\nat public houses on their return from the places of burial, are\r\nintrusted without care or selection to perform what may be shown to be\r\nimportant sanitary and civil ministrations of enshrouding and preparing\r\nthe body for burial. The impressions created by the bearing of these\r\ncoarse, unknown, unrespected, irresponsible hands, add to the revolting\r\npopular associations with death.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the public interests affected by so much of the practice\r\nof interment, as the undertaker’s service embraces, will be better\r\nappreciated in a subsequent stage of this report, and after the\r\nconsideration of the facts unfolded in the course of an examination of\r\nthe influence of the expenses of funerals specifically on the states of\r\nmind, social habits and economy of the labouring classes in towns of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Specific Effects of the Expenses of Funerals, and Associations to\r\n              defray them amongst the Labouring Classes._\r\n\r\n§ 53. The desire to secure respectful interment of themselves and their\r\nrelations is, perhaps, the strongest and most widely-diffused feeling\r\namongst the labouring classes of the population. Subscriptions may be\r\nobtained from large classes of them for their burial when it can be\r\nobtained neither for their own relief in sickness, nor for the education\r\nof their children, nor for any other object. The amount of the\r\ntwenty-four millions of deposits in the savings’ banks of the United\r\nKingdom is 29_l._ each depositor. Judging from particular\r\ninvestigations, it would appear that upwards of 5_l._ of each deposit\r\nmay be considered a sum devoted to defray the expenses of burial, and\r\nabout as much more to provide mourning and other expenses. From six to\r\neight millions of savings may be considered as devoted to these objects.\r\n\r\n§ 54. The following is an answer to some inquiries on the subject from\r\nthe secretary of the St. Martin’s Lane Provident Institution, an\r\ninstitution in which the deposits amount to 1,168,850_l._, and the\r\ndepositors, amounting to upwards of 32,000, comprehend some of the most\r\nfrugal and respectable of the labouring classes:—\r\n\r\n  As you wished me to mention any facts within my knowledge, arising\r\n  out of this institution and its concerns, bearing upon the question\r\n  of _sepulture_, I would first state, that the average _annual\r\n  number_ of deaths occurring amongst our depositors (now about 32,000\r\n  in number) in the course of the last nine years, has been 231;\r\n  these, taking the last of such years for an example, are divisible\r\n  under the classes shown by the subjoined statement. By reference to\r\n  this statement it will be seen how large a class of our depositors\r\n  consists of individuals of the poorer or labouring population; and\r\n  amongst that class, in regard to the question of _sepulture_, from\r\n  the opportunity afforded me of inspecting the charges made for\r\n  funerals, I should say that the expenses incurred for the funeral\r\n  and interment alone are seldom so little as 4_l._, generally amount\r\n  to 5_l._ and upwards, and not unfrequently exceed 6_l._\r\n\r\n  It is, I may observe, no uncommon practice for parties to leave\r\n  deposits in their names, about the amount I have stated, for the\r\n  very purpose of providing for the expenses of their interment, so as\r\n  to ensure for themselves, under any change of circumstances, a\r\n  decent burial; this feeling has prevailed so strongly in instances\r\n  within my own knowledge, that, upon the happening of the death, the\r\n  party has been found to have died at last an inmate of a poor house,\r\n  and destitute of every kind of property, save only the little fund\r\n  appropriated for the purpose I have stated. This feeling is not\r\n  confined solely to the poorest class of our depositors: an instance\r\n  lately occurred in which a depositor to the amount of 32_l._, made a\r\n  special request that 20_l._ of this money might, in the event of her\r\n  death, be paid only to _her undertaker_ on production of his account\r\n  and of _her burial certificate_, and the balance to be paid to her\r\n  relatives. The depositor died in the following year, and her wishes\r\n  were accordingly carried into effect, with the concurrence of a\r\n  relative, to whom it appeared she had communicated the arrangement\r\n  she had thus made in regard to her money deposited with this\r\n  institution.\r\n\r\n ──────────────╥────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n  Total Number ║\r\n  of Deaths in ║Total Effects of such deceased Depositions, certified as\r\n    the Year   ║           under the following Amounts, viz:—\r\n ending 31st of║\r\n  March, 1842. ║\r\n ──────────────╫─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┬────────\r\n               ║     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │ Amount\r\n               ║ £50 │£100 │£200 │£300 │£400 │£450 │£600 │£800 │to £1000\r\n               ║     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │  and\r\n               ║     │     │     │     │     │     │     │     │upwards.\r\n ──────────────╫─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┼────────\r\n      232      ║ 133 │ 32  │ 23  │ 10  │  1  │  5  │  6  │  6  │   16\r\n ──────────────╨─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┴────────\r\n\r\nOccurrences such as those above alluded to are not unfrequent. Those\r\nwho, as paupers, have led a life of dissipation, and have saved nothing\r\nfor other objects, have yet reserved and concealed a small hoard to\r\nprovide interment in a mode agreeable to their feelings. Besides the\r\nimmense amount of money reserved for this purpose in the savings’ banks,\r\nit forms the great object of the benefit clubs: in most large towns\r\nthere are burial clubs instituted for no other purpose. In the town of\r\nPreston nearly 30,000 persons, men, women, and children, are associated\r\nin six large societies for the purpose of burial; the chief of these\r\nclubs comprehends 15,164 members, and has since its commencement\r\nexpended upwards of 1,000_l._ per annum, raised in weekly contributions,\r\nfrom a halfpenny and a penny to three-halfpence and two-pence per week.\r\nA benevolent officer, in giving an account of this club, expresses a\r\nhope that it may be practicable, in connexion with it, to get up some\r\nprovision for the living, in the shape of medical attendance for the\r\nsick, an object which appears to have been entirely lost sight of in\r\nthese societies. Besides the burial societies, of which the funds are\r\ndeposited in the savings’ banks, there are others in which the funds are\r\nplaced out in the hands of private persons, traders, who pay interest\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\n§ 55. As an example of the allowances in the provincial clubs, it may be\r\nmentioned, that on an examination of the rules of 90 friendly societies\r\nat present existing in the borough and town of Walsall, comprising\r\nupwards of 5000 members, it appeared that the allowances insured for\r\nfunerals were as follows:—that\r\n\r\n                    For the Funeral │                   For the Funeral\r\n                    of the Husband. │                    of the Wife.\r\n 22 societies                pay £10│36 societies                 pay £3\r\n 12                                8│16                                5\r\n 8                                 7│14                                4\r\n 3                                16│9                                 8\r\n                                    │3                                 6\r\n                                    │3                                 7\r\n\r\nThe burial allowances in the others were not specified.\r\n\r\n§ 56. It must be premised, that it appears to be a serious error to\r\nregard the arrangements of all of this class of clubs as the\r\narrangements of the poor people themselves; the arrangements are\r\nevidence only of the intensity of their feelings on the subject of\r\ninterment, of their ignorance and their extensive need of information\r\nand trustworthy guidance.\r\n\r\nThere are, for example, in Westminster, Marylebone, Finsbury, the City,\r\nand the Tower Hamlets, districts of the metropolis, about 200 of such\r\nsocieties, composed chiefly of the labouring classes, comprising from\r\n100 to 800 members each, possessing aggregate amounts of deposits of\r\nfrom 90_l._ to 1000_l._ each; raised in contributions of from\r\nthree-halfpence to two-pence per week, and paying on the death of a\r\nmember from 5_l._ to 10_l._ Besides these, there are clubs of a higher\r\ndescription, mostly amongst the smallest class of tradesmen, where the\r\nsums insured extend to sums as high as 200_l._, payable at the member’s\r\ndeath, and are understood to be chiefly devoted to the payment of the\r\nfuneral expenses. The burial clubs for the labouring classes are\r\ngenerally got up by an undertaker and by the publican at whose house the\r\nclub is held. The state of feeling addressed in the formation of these\r\nsocieties is denoted by the terms of the placards issued at the joint\r\nexpense of the publican or of the undertaker, or rather of some mechanic\r\nor person of another trade, who gets the business done by an undertaker.\r\nThese placards are frequently headed “In the midst of life we are in\r\ndeath;” and the addresses are in such terms as the following, which is\r\ntaken from “The United Brothers’ and Sisters’ Burial Society,” held at\r\nthe Old Duke William public house, Ratcliffe Highway:—\r\n\r\n  “In contemplating the many vicissitudes and changes incident to all\r\n  persons of every station in life, and the many anxieties that crowd\r\n  about our advancing years, more particularly the labouring class,\r\n  through the uncertainty of employment, by long illness, or for want\r\n  of friends reduced to extreme distress, and after a long and\r\n  miserable life, and in expectation of that awful change which we\r\n  must one time or other undergo, without ever providing for a decent\r\n  interment, it will be some alleviation to our sufferings to remember\r\n  that we bring no pecuniary burthen on our commiserating friends and\r\n  relations, that at least we have divested our suffering families of\r\n  that anxiety respecting our mortal remains which would add another\r\n  pang to their already lacerated hearts: it too frequently occurs to\r\n  the sorrow of many a feeling heart, who mourns over the deplorable\r\n  loss of a beloved husband, wife, or friend; to obtain this desirable\r\n  object, this society offers to the public, on easy terms, advantages\r\n  worthy the consideration of persons in all stations of life.”\r\n\r\nThe terms of insurance are—\r\n\r\n  “That to defray the necessary expenses of printing books, bills,\r\n  &c., that members of the first class, if under the age of 55 years,\r\n  shall pay 1_s._ entrance, and contribute 1_s._ per month to the box\r\n  and 2_d._ per quarter to the secretary; and members of the second\r\n  class, under the age of 55 years, shall pay 6_d._ entrance, and\r\n  6_d._ per month to the box, and 2_d._ per quarter to the secretary;\r\n  and every person above the age of 55 years, and members of the first\r\n  class, to pay 2_s._ entrance, and contribute 1_s._ 6_d._ per month\r\n  to the box, and 2_d._ per quarter to the secretary; and every member\r\n  of the second class to pay 1_s._ entrance, and contribute 1_s._ per\r\n  month to the box, and 2_d._ per quarter to the secretary. No more\r\n  than 20 members will be admitted above the age of 60 years. They to\r\n  be free in 12 months; nor shall any article that may be hereafter\r\n  made exclude them.”\r\n\r\nThe benefits insured are to be—\r\n\r\n  “That at the death of a free member, immediate notice shall be given\r\n  to T. Scotcher, undertaker, who shall perform the funeral, and he\r\n  shall inform one of the committee, and the first meeting night after\r\n  the burial, his or her relation, next of kin, or nominee, on\r\n  producing satisfactory evidence, will be entitled (if a member of\r\n  the first class) to the sum of 10_l._; if a member of the second\r\n  class, and above seven years, to 5_l._; if under the age of seven\r\n  years, to 3_l._; but when the stock of this society amounts to\r\n  150_l._ in the public funds, if a member in the first class admitted\r\n  ten years, 12_l._ will be allowed; and if a member admitted ten\r\n  years in the second class, 6_l._ will be allowed, deducting all\r\n  arrears on the books; and for the credit of the society, the\r\n  committee shall see the undertaker’s bill discharged.”\r\n\r\nThe publican is secured by a provision that the box shall not be removed\r\nto any other public house; and the office of “J. Scotcher, undertaker\r\nand founder of the Society,” is made permanent. An arbitrary rule, in\r\nsuch terms as the following, is so couched (the officers being judges)\r\nas to suppress complaint. This rule is common to other societies:—\r\n\r\n  That if any member charge the committee, or any member thereof, or\r\n  trustees, or secretary, with any improper practice in the management\r\n  of the society, and cannot make it appear just, he or she shall be\r\n  fined 5_s._, or be excluded.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the high and exclusive spirit of some of the\r\nrules would seem to show how little the body of the members are\r\nconsulted in the preparation of them. Thus, in the “Ancient Friendly\r\nSociety,” it is provided that “if any man sits down to drink with the\r\nstewards to pay sixpence, whether a member or not.” It is provided in\r\nthe rules of the “Loyal United Friends,” that “if any person sit down to\r\ndrink with the committee he is to pay sixpence;” and it is the same with\r\na large proportion of the others.\r\n\r\nIn what is called an “improved burial society,” of the date of 1841,\r\ncalled the East London Burial Society, held at the Swan public house,\r\nBethnal Green, the terms are:—\r\n\r\n  That the members of this society shall pay their contributions\r\n  weekly or monthly, and shall pay 1_d._ per quarter extra, to defray\r\n  other expenses attending the society. Every member shall pay 1_d._\r\n  per week for the first class, from two to fifty-five years; the\r\n  second class, from ten to fifty-five years, 2_d._ per week; the\r\n  third class, from ten to fifty-five years, shall pay 3_d._ per week.\r\n\r\nRichard Crafer appears to be the president, and William Duggan\r\nsecretary; then Richard Crafer afterwards appears as the undertaker.\r\nWith respect to him the following is inserted as a fundamental rule of\r\nthe society:—\r\n\r\n  That Richard Crafer, being the founder of this Society, shall be the\r\n  undertaker, and no future articles shall remove him, so long as he\r\n  gives general satisfaction to the society, and in case of his death,\r\n  his eldest son shall claim the same for the benefit of the widow,\r\n  and at her decease the same shall devolve on the eldest son living.\r\n\r\n  Mr. William Duggan is appointed secretary, and for his attendance\r\n  and services he shall be allowed the sum of 1_d._ per quarter, for\r\n  as many members as there are on the society’s books: he will assist\r\n  the society with his best advice, and register good and healthy\r\n  members, and post the books. He shall be allowed 3_d._ each for all\r\n  notices he may deliver on the society’s business, but not obliged to\r\n  go more than two miles from the club-house.\r\n\r\nThis is preceded by the usual rule, that—\r\n\r\n  Any member _coming_ to the society’s meeting-house in liquor, so as\r\n  to disturb the proceedings, shall be fined 1_s._, and ordered to\r\n  leave the room; and should any member charge the committee,\r\n  secretary, president, trustees, or landlord with any unjust\r\n  proceedings relative to the society, and cannot substantiate the\r\n  same, he or she shall pay a fine not exceeding 10_s._ to the stock,\r\n  or be excluded.\r\n\r\nIn the society of “United Brewers and Draymen,” of which J. Guy is\r\nsecretary and undertaker, one of the fundamental rules is, that—\r\n\r\n  At the funeral of a member, the secretary shall provide fittings for\r\n  porters and six pall bearers, for which he shall be allowed 1_l._,\r\n  whether they are used or not, provided such member dies and is\r\n  interred within three miles of any meeting-house.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of the provision commonly held out, is stated in the\r\nfollowing rule of the General Burial Society:—\r\n\r\n  That the landlord for the time being shall be treasurer, and when\r\n  there is sufficient cash, above what is necessary to supply the\r\n  exigencies of the society, the same shall be vested in the public\r\n  funds, in the names of the trustees appointed by the committee. The\r\n  landlord, as treasurer, &c., shall give proper security for the due\r\n  performance of his offices.\r\n\r\nAn evil entailed beyond the excessive amount of subscriptions paid for\r\nan object that is but poorly obtained, is the impulse given by it to the\r\nvice of drinking; to the destruction of real friendly sympathy amongst\r\nthe working classes, by making the announcement of the death to be\r\nreceived as the demoralizing announcement of a coming carousal. Such\r\nexpenses can only be incurred in the absence of proper feeling, in the\r\nface of destitute orphan children. The secretary of one of the better\r\nordered burial clubs, a working man, thus speaks of the regulations\r\nwhich tend to drinking. He was asked—\r\n\r\n  What number of members have you?—Two hundred, who pay sixpence per\r\n  month.\r\n\r\n  What is the publican’s advantage out of this?—The allowance is\r\n  sixpence spending-money from each committee-man. I do not like this,\r\n  and have wanted to change the place of meeting to a coffee-house,\r\n  for the members frequently add a shilling to the sixpence\r\n  spending-money, and are then not in a condition to begin business;\r\n  but I find it is part of the rules of this, as well as of the other\r\n  societies, that they shall be held at public houses.\r\n\r\n  On the occasion of the funeral is there no drinking?—Yes, there is;\r\n  that is another great evil, and I wish there was a way of remedying\r\n  it. The family provide themselves with drink, and the friends coming\r\n  also drink. I have known this to be to such excess, that the\r\n  undertaker’s men, who always take whatever drink is given them, are\r\n  frequently unfit to perform their duty, and have reeled in carrying\r\n  the coffin. At these times it is very distressing. The men who stand\r\n  as mutes at the door, as they stand out in the cold, are supposed to\r\n  require most drink, and receive it most liberally. I have seen these\r\n  men reel about the road, and after the burial we have been obliged\r\n  to put these mutes and their staves into the interior of the hearse\r\n  and drive them home, as they were incapable of walking. After the\r\n  return from the funeral, the mourners commonly have drink again at\r\n  the house. This drinking at the funeral is a very great evil.\r\n\r\nBesides the regulations of meeting which lead to expenditure for\r\ndrinking, besides express regulations for allowances of drink, the\r\n“funeral allowances” are sometimes read by the publican to mean\r\n“expenditure” with him. The officers of a club in Liverpool having been\r\nsummoned before Mr. Rushton, the magistrate, for the non-payment of a\r\nsum allowed by the rules, for funeral expenses, the steward of the club\r\nattended, and in answer to the claim, stated that the complainant had\r\nrefused to take 4_s._ worth of whiskey at the house where the club\r\nmeetings were held, a quantity which had been used and allowed in that\r\nand other clubs, as forming part of the “funeral expenses.”\r\nNotwithstanding the usage, the magistrate refused to sanction the\r\nsteward’s reading of the term; and decided that the whole of the payment\r\nof expenses must be in money and not in whiskey.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to ascertain the amount spent in drink, but it appears\r\nfrom the amount cited of the expenditure in the 90 societies at Walsall,\r\nthat the required allowance was 2_d._ per month, in others 3_d._, and\r\nthe aggregate sum spent in those clubs (if it were only limited to the\r\nrule), must have amounted to 981_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._; but besides these\r\nprescribed portions of drink, there are prescribed annual feasts, at\r\nfrom 2_s._ 3_d._ to 3_s._ 6_d._ per member, amounting to an annual sum\r\nof 257_l._ 10_s._, making a total of 1239_l._ 3_s._ 4_d._ per annum,\r\nexpended in such expenses. Besides these, there are decoration expenses,\r\nin which one society alone expended between 70_l._ and 80_l._ Seventeen\r\nof the societies had lost 1500_l._, and one of them 600_l._, through\r\nvarious causes (such as the defalcations of secretaries), either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, attributable to an inefficient system of\r\nmanagement. If the one year’s expenditure on drink, feast, and\r\ndecoration money, were placed out in the savings’ bank, at interest,\r\ntogether with the amount of losses from mismanagement, the amount due to\r\nthe contributors, to this small group of societies, would, at the end of\r\n10 years, have amounted to the sum of 5328_l._ 19_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\n§ 57. To prevent frauds, some of the rules provide that the secretary\r\nshall see the body. For this service, in the society called the “Frugal\r\nSociety,” where 7_l._ is allowed for the interment, a fee of 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nis allowed to him, and 4_s._ if he have to go from two to five miles for\r\nthe purpose. It is to be observed, that this is the usual fee provided\r\nby such societies for any inspection of the body.\r\n\r\nThe publican is generally made the treasurer, and usually the money is\r\nplaced by him into the hands of his brewer, by whom from four to five\r\nper cent. interest is paid for its use as capital. In other instances it\r\nforms a capital for the publican himself; in some instances it is lent\r\nto other tradesmen. Though failures of societies have occurred from the\r\nfailure of those to whom their funds have been lent, they do not appear\r\nto have been so frequent as the failures from the erroneous bases in\r\nrespect to insurance on which they are generally founded.\r\n\r\n§ 58. Believing that if the sums insured for burial in most of the\r\nburial clubs were received in money, the premiums paid by the members of\r\nthese clubs are excessive, as compared with the premiums paid in the\r\nhigher classes of insurance offices, I have submitted a number of their\r\nregulations, which may be considered specimens of the common terms of\r\nassurance, to Mr. Jenkin Jones, the actuary of the National Mercantile\r\nLife Assurance Society. His conclusions, which are confirmed by Mr.\r\nGriffith Davies, the actuary of the Guardian Office, show that for a\r\nrisk, for which, if the Northampton tables were taken as the basis of\r\nthe assurance, that in the large society at Preston, where an annual\r\npremium of 3_s._ 9_d._ would be taken for one risk by an assurance\r\noffice, 7_s._ 10_d._ is taken from the contributors by the club. The\r\nGeneral Friendly Society, for a risk for which 3_s._ 9_d._ would suffice\r\non the Northampton table, receives 11_s._ 5_d._ Instead of an average\r\npremium of 5_s._ 2_d._, the “Friendly Society” takes 11_s._ 1_d._ If we\r\nadd 25 per cent., to the premium that would be charged according to the\r\nNorthampton rate (which is supposed to represent a higher mortality than\r\nthe average) for expenses of management, including books, stationery,\r\n&c., and to cover the loss of interest occasioned by weekly or monthly\r\ncontributions, instead of annual premiums payable at the beginning of\r\neach year, in nearly all these clubs the poor man pays an excess for\r\nburial of, at least, one-third,—besides the expense of liquor more than\r\nhe would otherwise drink, which he is induced to take at the time of his\r\nmultiplied attendances to pay his weekly subscriptions. There are\r\nvarious causes (which it would require a long report to specify) for the\r\nfailure of these clubs, and for the loss of the savings devoted to their\r\nobjects. The chief manager, the undertaker, has commonly an immediate\r\ninterest in the admission of bad lives, which bring him quick funerals.\r\nThe younger members often begin to perceive that they are subjected to\r\nunduly heavy charges, and when they are in the majority, they break up\r\nthe society and divide the stock among them equally, and the older\r\nmembers who have contributed from the commencement are mercilessly\r\ndeprived of the consolation for which they have during a great part of\r\ntheir lives made the most constant sacrifices. Independently of the\r\nexcessive rates charged by these societies, the principle upon which the\r\ncharges are made is a very unjust one, viz.—that of charging the same\r\nrate to each member, without reference to age.\r\n\r\n§ 59. It will be seen from the following table that the “Friendly”\r\nSociety’s premium (11_s._ 1_d._) is rather more than double the average\r\nof the Northampton (5_s._ 2_d._), and the premium by the Northampton\r\nrates for ages 15 and 45 are 3_s._ 10_d._, and 7_s._ 9_d._; the premiums\r\nof the “Friendly” Society, therefore, according to their own average,\r\nought not to be more for these ages than about twice these amounts, or\r\nfor age 15, 7_s._ 8_d._; age 45, 15_s._ 6_d._; but members between these\r\nages pay alike (11_s._ 1_d._), the younger member therefore pays 3_s._\r\n5_d._ _more_ than he ought, and the older member 4_s._ 5_d._ less than\r\nhe ought.\r\n\r\n ─────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n          │“Friendly” Society │  Average Premium  │ Premium according\r\n   Age.   │     Premium.      │ according to the  │to the Northampton\r\n          │                   │ Northampton Rate. │       Rate.\r\n ─────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n          │  _s._      _d._   │  _s._      _d._   │  _s._      _d._\r\n   7–45   │   11         1    │    5         2    │\r\n     15   │                   │                   │    3        10\r\n     45   │                   │                   │    7         9\r\n ─────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────┴───────────────────\r\n\r\nAnd by the Northampton rate (upon the principle adopted by the society),\r\nthe younger member would have to pay 1_s._ 4_d._ more and the elder\r\nmember 2_s._ 7_d._ less than he ought. As an exemplification of the\r\ninstability of such societies, Mr. Tidd Pratt mentioned to me that at a\r\nrecent election of a poor man to a vacancy in the Metropolitan Benefit\r\nSocieties’ Asylum, a condition of which is that the candidate must be\r\nabove sixty years of age, and have been a member of a benefit society\r\nmore than ten years, there were 32 candidates, from whose documents it\r\nappeared that the societies of no less than 14 out of the 32 had been\r\ndissolved, and that some of them had belonged to two societies, and that\r\nboth had failed them. Such societies are nevertheless constantly renewed\r\non the old and unsafe foundations; and so intense is the prevalent\r\nfeeling on the subject of respectful interment, that to secure it, a\r\nlarge proportion of the working population pay the same extravagant\r\npremiums to several of these clubs, in the hope that one, at least, may\r\nat the last avail them. On the death of a mechanic, the first business\r\nof an experienced undertaker is to ascertain of how many societies the\r\ndeceased was a member, and to arrange the funeral accordingly. I am\r\ninformed that it is not unfrequent that such sums as fifteen, twenty,\r\nthirty, and even forty pounds’ expenses are incurred for a mechanic’s\r\nfuneral under these circumstances. When two or three of the undertakers\r\nof different clubs meet on the same search, and when they cannot agree\r\nto “settle” between them their shares in the performance of the\r\nfunerals, very complex questions arise, which, it is stated, the\r\nmagistrates have great difficulty in settling.\r\n\r\n§ 60. The exercise, on the parts of the lowest classes, of the feeling,\r\nin itself so laudable and apparently susceptible of great moral good,\r\nunder proper guidance, has, in those districts where the burial\r\nsocieties are conspicuous and numerous, led to dreadful incidental\r\nconsequences, displaying, amongst other things, the dangers of\r\ndisturbing natural responsibilities, and allowing interests to be placed\r\nin operation against moral duties.\r\n\r\n§ 61. The insecurity of the burial societies has, under the anxiety of\r\nfeeling of the working classes, lest they might fail of their object\r\nfrom the failure of the club, led to multiplied insurances for adults,\r\nthence for families, and for children; and thence has arisen high gains\r\non the death of each child,—in other words, a bounty on neglect and\r\ninfanticide. Those who are aware of the moral condition of a large\r\nproportion of the population, will expect that such an interest would,\r\nsooner or later, have its operation on some depraved minds to be found\r\nin every class.\r\n\r\n§ 62. Mr. Robert Hawksworth, the Visitor to the Manchester and Salford\r\nDistrict Provident Society, recently stated to me,—“Here, the mode of\r\nconducting the funerals—the habits of drinking at the time of assemblage\r\nat the house, before the corpse is removed, renewed on the return from\r\nthe funeral, when they drink to excess, the long retention of the body\r\nin the one room, are all exceedingly demoralizing. The occasion of a\r\nfuneral is commonly looked to, amongst the lowest grade, as the occasion\r\nof ‘a stir;’ the occasion of the drinking is viewed at the least with\r\ncomplacency.” A minister in the neighbourhood of Manchester expressed\r\nhis sorrow on observing a great want of natural feeling, and great\r\napathy at the funerals. The sight of a free flow of tears was a\r\nrefreshment which he seldom received. He was, moreover, often shocked by\r\na common phrase amongst women of the lowest class—“Aye, aye, that child\r\nwill not live; it is in the burial club.”\r\n\r\nThe actual _cost_ of the funeral of a child varies from 1_l._ to 30_s._\r\nThe allowances from the clubs in that town on the occurrence of the\r\ndeath of a child are usually 3_l._, and extend to 4_l._ and 5_l._ But\r\ninsurances for such payments on the deaths of children are made in four\r\nor five of these burial societies; and an officer mentioned to me an\r\ninstance where one man had insured such payments in no less than\r\nnineteen different burial-clubs in Manchester. Officers of these\r\nsocieties, relieving officers, and others whose administrative duties\r\nput them in communication with the lowest classes in those districts,\r\nexpress their moral conviction of the operation of such bounties to\r\nproduce instances of the visible neglect of children, of which they are\r\nwitnesses. They often say—“You are not treating that child properly; it\r\nwill not live; is it in the club?” and the answer corresponds with the\r\nimpression produced by the sight. Mr. Gardiner, the clerk to the\r\nManchester Union, in the course of his exercise of the important\r\nfunctions of registering the causes of death, deemed the cause assigned\r\nby a labouring man for the death of a child unsatisfactory, and on\r\nstaying to inquire found that popular rumour assigned the death to\r\nwilful starvation:—\r\n\r\n  The child (according to a statement of the case) had been entered in\r\n  at least ten burial clubs; and its parents had six other children,\r\n  who only lived from nine to eighteen months respectively. They had\r\n  received 20_l._ from several burial clubs for one of these children,\r\n  and they expected to receive at least us much on account of this\r\n  child. An inquest was held at Mr. Gardiner’s insistence when several\r\n  persons, who had known the deceased, stated that she was a fine fat\r\n  child shortly after her birth, but that she soon became quite thin,\r\n  was badly clothed, and seemed as if she did not get a sufficiency of\r\n  food. She was mostly in the care of a girl six or seven years of\r\n  age: her father bore the character of a drunken man. He had another\r\n  child, which was in several burial clubs, and was a year old when it\r\n  died; the child’s mother stated that the child was more than ten\r\n  months old, but she could not recollect the day of her birth; she\r\n  thought its complaint was convulsions, in which it died. It had been\r\n  ill about seven weeks; when it took ill, she had given it some oil\r\n  of aniseeds and squills, which she had procured from Mr. Smith, a\r\n  druggist. Since then she had given it nothing in the way of\r\n  medicine, except some wine and water, which she gave it during the\r\n  last few days of its life, when it could not suck or take gruel. It\r\n  was in three burial clubs; her husband told her that they had\r\n  received upwards of 20_l._ from burial clubs in which the other\r\n  child had been entered; none of her children who had died were more\r\n  than eighteen months old.\r\n\r\n  A surgeon stated, that he made a _post-mortem_ examination of the\r\n  body of deceased; it was then in an advanced state of decomposition,\r\n  but not so far gone as to interfere with the examination. There was\r\n  no appearance of external violence on the body, but there was an\r\n  extreme degree of emaciation. The brain was healthy, and gave no\r\n  indication of convulsions having been the cause of death; the\r\n  process of teething had not commenced; had such been the case, it\r\n  might have led to the supposition that fits might have occurred; the\r\n  lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines were in a natural and healthy\r\n  state.\r\n\r\n  The jury having expressed it as their opinion that the evidence of\r\n  the parents was made up for the occasion, and entitled to no credit,\r\n  returned the following verdict:—“Died through want of nourishment;\r\n  but whether occasioned by a deficiency of food, or by disease of the\r\n  liver and spine, brought on by improper food and drink, or\r\n  otherwise, does not appear.”\r\n\r\nNo further steps were taken upon this verdict; and the man enforced\r\npayments upon his insurances from ten burial clubs, and obtained from\r\nthem a total sum of 34_l._ 3_s._ for the burial of this one child. Two\r\nsimilar cases came under the notice of Mr. Coppock, the Clerk and\r\nSuperintendent-Registrar of the Stockport Union, in both of which he\r\nprosecuted the parties for murder. In one case, where three children had\r\nbeen poisoned with arsenic, the father was tried, with the mother, and\r\nconvicted at Chester, and sentenced to be transported for life, but the\r\nmother was acquitted. In the other case, where the judge summed up for a\r\nconviction, the accused, the father, was, to the astonishment of every\r\none, acquitted. In this case the body was exhumed after interment, and\r\narsenic was detected in the stomach. In consequence of the suspicion\r\nraised upon the death, on which the accusation was made in the first\r\ncase, the bodies of two other children were taken up and examined, when\r\narsenic was found in the stomach. In all these cases payments on the\r\ndeaths of the children were insured from the burial clubs: the cost of\r\nthe coffin and burial dues would not be more than about 1_l._, and the\r\nallowance from the club is 3_l._\r\n\r\n§ 63. It is remarked, on these dreadful cases, by the Superintendent\r\nRegistrar, that the children who were boys, and therefore likely to be\r\nuseful to the parents, were not poisoned; the female children were the\r\nvictims. It was the clear opinion of the medical officers that\r\ninfanticides have been committed in Stockport to obtain the burial\r\nmoney.[12] Cases of the culpable neglect of children who were insured in\r\nseveral clubs had been observed at Preston. The collector of a burial\r\nsociety, one of the most respectable in Manchester, stated to me strong\r\ngrounds for believing that it had become a practice to neglect children\r\nfor the sake of the money allowed. The practice of insuring in a number\r\nof these clubs was increasing. He gave the following description of the\r\nfrauds to which the clubs were exposed:—\r\n\r\n  A great number of individuals have themselves and family in two or\r\n  more societies, and by that means realize a great sum of money at\r\n  the death of any one of them; and I have no doubt at all in saying\r\n  that a great many deaths are occasioned through neglect, when there\r\n  is a great sum to be obtained at their decease. Such cases as these\r\n  generally happen amongst the lower orders of society.\r\n\r\n  In reference to cases of undoubted imposition, I will just name a\r\n  few out of a great many. A person residing in Manchester wished to\r\n  enter herself and grandchild into our society. We went to the house,\r\n  and there were from ten to twelve individuals present, the greater\r\n  part of them children,—two of them somewhere about three months old.\r\n  I asked who it was that was going to enter? The mistress of the\r\n  house spoke up, and said it was herself and her grandchild. I asked\r\n  which was her grandchild? She took a very fine child in her arms and\r\n  said that was it, and asked me would it do?—to which I answered,\r\n  yes. The other was a very thin ghastly-looking child. I asked what\r\n  was the matter with it? She said they could not tell; it had been so\r\n  from the time it was born. I assure you, sir, it was an awful sight\r\n  to look at. A thought struck me when I came out, that if that child\r\n  died they might say it was the child I entered, so I determined to\r\n  keep my eye on it every time I called, which was once a fortnight.\r\n  In four months afterwards this thin child died, and according to my\r\n  anticipations they brought a notice of death for the child I had not\r\n  entered. I went down to visit, and on looking at it, and examining\r\n  it, I pronounced it not the child I had entered. She said it was,\r\n  and a great contest arose for about an hour, during which time I\r\n  asked her were there not two children about the same age when first\r\n  I came into her house? which she denied at first, but afterwards\r\n  admitted it. I then asked her was not one of them a very fine and\r\n  the other a very thin child? to which she answered, yes. I then\r\n  asked her whether it was the finest or the thin one I entered? She\r\n  answered, the finest one. I then asked her was that the fine one?\r\n  She said, yes. I then asked her where was the thin child? She\r\n  pointed to one that was sleeping in a bed, and said that was it. I\r\n  looked at it, and said this was the child I entered. I then asked\r\n  her how it was that this child which was sleeping had become so fat\r\n  and the other so thin? to which she said she could not tell. Now I\r\n  said to her, it is clear enough how you have done this; you showed\r\n  me that living child, and gave me the name of the one that is dead,\r\n  which she denied having done; and so we were compelled to give her\r\n  the money because we had no means of finding it out but by some one\r\n  in the house telling of her. But since, a little light has been\r\n  thrown on it by her husband uttering a saying when he was drunk one\r\n  day when I was there. This was the saying:—“A bright set of boys you\r\n  are, burying the living for the dead!”—meaning that we gave burial\r\n  money for a living child; but he was immediately stopped by his\r\n  wife.\r\n\r\n  Another case, a woman in Salford, entered herself and two sons, and\r\n  one of them was far gone in consumption; this we discovered and on\r\n  asking, why she did it, she said she thought she could get a few\r\n  pounds to bury him. Another, a man entered his wife, and she lay\r\n  dying at the same time. When we asked him where his wife was, he\r\n  pointed to a woman that was sitting by the fireside, and said that\r\n  was her; but his wife died before she became a member. Another\r\n  person, in order to obtain the funeral money, kept his child three\r\n  weeks, until it was in a state of decomposition. The last case, out\r\n  of many more that might be named, is rather ludicrous.\r\n\r\n  A man and his wife, residing in Cotton-street, agreed that one of\r\n  them, namely, the husband, should pretend to be dead, in order that\r\n  the wife might receive his funeral money; accordingly the wife\r\n  proceeds in due form to give notice of his death; the visiting\r\n  officer on behalf of the society, whose duty it was to see the\r\n  corpse, repairs to the house, enters the chamber, and inquires for\r\n  the deceased; the should-be disconsolate widow points him to the\r\n  body of her late husband, whose chin was tied up with a handkerchief\r\n  in the attitude of death; he surveys the corpse—the eyelids seem to\r\n  move; he feels the pulse, the certain signs of life are there: the\r\n  officer pronounceth him not dead; she in return says, _he is dead_,\r\n  for there has not been a _breath_ in _him_ since 12 o’clock last\r\n  night. The neighbours are called in; a discussion ensues between the\r\n  wife and the officer: some declare they saw the husband at the door\r\n  that morning giving a light. He (the officer) requires her to bring\r\n  a doctor; she goes, and says she can’t get one to come; the officer\r\n  goes and brings one, who ordered him to be raised up in the bed, and\r\n  having obtained some water, the doctor, while the man was sitting\r\n  up, dashed it in his face.\r\n\r\nThe man was apprehended and taken before the magistrates for the fraud.\r\nSir Charles Shaw, the Commissioner of Police, directed that he should be\r\nproduced in court in the same dress in which he had been laid out and\r\nwas apprehended, which produced a very salutary effect.\r\n\r\n§ 64. The evidence in respect to the crimes committed under such\r\ncircumstances may be carried into wider ramifications. Some of the\r\nbetter constituted societies have perceived the evil of insurances,\r\ncarried to the extent of entirely removing responsibilities, or creating\r\nbounties, to the promotion of the event insured against, and have\r\nendeavoured to abate the evil, as far as they could, by the adoption of\r\na condition, that no payment should be made where a party was found to\r\nhave been a member or to have insured in another club.\r\n\r\n§ 65. The collector of the society, whose exemplification of one class\r\nof frauds is above cited, stated, that they were about to adopt the\r\ncommon rule of the insurance societies, that all claims should be\r\nforfeited for an act of suicide; for they had even instances which\r\nshowed that men held their own lives on so loose a tenure as to throw\r\nthem away on apparently slight motives. In one instance a man went to\r\nthe secretary, and asked whether, if he were to commit suicide, his\r\nwidow would be entitled to the burial money? The secretary stated that,\r\nthere being no rule against it, he thought, the survivor would be\r\nentitled. The man, having fully satisfied himself on this point, went\r\naway and took poison. The amount of burial money gained was supposed to\r\nbe 50_l._ In another case, the letter announcing to the widow the\r\nbenefit he had secured, grew indistinct from the working of the poison\r\nand the sinking of life whilst the man was writing it, until it was\r\nnearly illegible. But the occurrence of such facts, showing a\r\nrecklessness of life, with a degree of strength of domestic affections\r\nwhich induces them to encounter violent deaths for the sake of the\r\nsurvivors, is not confined to one class of society. Soon after the\r\npractice of insuring from insurance companies, the payment of large sums\r\non the deaths of parties began to extend as a mode of providing for\r\nfamilies, instances occurred where tradesmen and persons of the higher\r\nand middle classes, having effected insurances on their own lives,\r\ncommitted suicide with the view apparently of securing to their families\r\nthe benefit of the sums insured. It is understood that the experience of\r\nsuch cases, and the obvious inducement which persons having in view to\r\ncommit suicide to effect insurances on their lives, and thus defraud the\r\noffices, led to the precaution, now almost universal, of inserting the\r\ncondition, which, however, is confined to insurance by persons on their\r\nown lives; that “if the assured shall die by his own act, whether sane\r\nor insane,” the policy shall be void. Yet frauds are occasionally\r\ncommitted by persons who must know that they have not long to live.\r\n\r\n§ 66. Multiplied payments on one death are contrary to the spirit, at\r\nthe least, of the law. A payment of a sum certain to parish officers, to\r\nbe relieved from any future payments in respect to an illegitimate\r\nchild, has been declared to be illegal. “One of the principles on which\r\nthat decision is founded is, that the payment of a large sum for the\r\nsupport of a child gives the parish a degree of interest in the child’s\r\ndeath, and might have a tendency to induce the officers to relax in\r\ntheir duty towards it.”[13]\r\n\r\n§ 67. In the higher order of life insurances, the legislature has\r\nendeavoured to arrest the dangerous tendency of insuring beyond the\r\ninterest, by providing, by statute 14 Geo. III., c. 48, that persons\r\ninsuring the lives of others shall have an interest in such lives; and\r\nit is a principle of insurance law that where a risk paid for has not\r\nbeen run, the premiums shall be returned; and it would seem to be a\r\nprinciple of common law that insurances beyond the actual interest are\r\nvoid. In the case of Fauntleroy, the banker, who insured his life in the\r\nAmicable Office for 6000_l._, the claim was resisted on the fact that he\r\nhad been attainted, convicted, and executed for forgeries committed\r\nsince the insurance, and the House of Lords held the insurance to be\r\nvoid on the plainest principles of public policy. The Lord Chancellor,\r\nin delivering the judgment of the house, said—“Is it possible that such\r\na contract could be sustained? Is it not void upon the plainest\r\nprinciples of public policy? Would not such a contract (if available)\r\ntake away one of those restraints operating on the minds of men against\r\nthe commission of crimes,—namely, the interest we have in the welfare\r\nand prosperity of our connexions? Now, if a policy of that description,\r\nwith such a form of condition inserted in it in express terms, cannot,\r\non grounds of public policy, be sustained, how is it to be contended\r\nthat in a policy expressed in such terms as the present, and after the\r\nevents which have happened, that we can sustain such a claim?”[14]\r\n\r\n§ 68. The Benefit clubs in large towns cannot easily take effectual\r\nmeasures against the multiplication of insurances, which indeed their\r\nown instability to some extent justifies, and they may find their\r\naccount, in paying sums beyond the legal authority, as the higher\r\ninsurance offices avowedly do, in paying on policies to parties who have\r\nhad no legal interest in the life insured. An officer of one of these\r\nlarge insurance establishments declared, that if they had acted upon the\r\ndecision of the courts in the case of Godson _v._ Boldero, “they might\r\nas well have shut their doors.”\r\n\r\n§ 69. Although the practice referred to, of multiplied insurances of\r\nsums payable on the death of children, appears happily to have broken\r\nout into infanticides only in the districts mentioned, yet as the means\r\nand the temptation are left equally open in all, the necessity of\r\npreventing them, as far as a direct legislative act may, is submitted,\r\nby a short provision prohibiting payments beyond the actual cost of\r\ninterment, and directing the return of the premiums or subscriptions\r\nwhere they have been given to more than one club.\r\n\r\n§ 70. The means for the most direct protection of infantile life, and\r\nfor giving additional security for life in general, will be subsequently\r\nsubmitted for consideration, with the evidence as to the means and the\r\nnecessity of the appointment of medical officers for the protection of\r\nthe public health.\r\n\r\n§ 71. A collateral means of security, and of the abatement of other\r\nevils incidental to the practice of interments, will be found in the\r\npracticable administrative measures for reducing the unnecessary expense\r\nof interments, and, by consequence, of the temptations to crime\r\nconstituted by the apparent expediency of the insurance of the payment\r\nof large sums to meet that expense.\r\n\r\nIt will, moreover, on further examination, become apparent, in this as\r\nin some other branches of public expenditure, that a course which\r\nattains increased efficiency with the popular desiderata in respect to\r\ninterments is a course of economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Total Expenses of Funerals to different Classes of Society._\r\n\r\n§ 72.

Hypothetical estimates of the amount of money which\r\nmust be expended to maintain so large a body of men as that engaged in\r\nthe business and service of the undertaker are confirmatory of this\r\nview. Even in Scotland the expense of the decent burial of a labouring\r\nman is not less than 5_l._, exclusive of the expense of mourning. I have\r\nbeen shown the payments on account of burials of an affiliated\r\nassociation of a convivial and benevolent character called the “Odd\r\nFellows,” which has upwards of 150,000 affiliated members, chiefly of\r\nthe better class of artisans, in different parts of the country. With\r\nthem, the payments usually amount to 10_l._ per funeral. The expenses of\r\nburial of some of the smaller descriptions of shopkeepers may not much\r\nexceed the expense of the undescribed class, which is taken us an\r\naverage between the sum set down for labourers and that for tradesmen;\r\nbut the latter is certainly a low average for the metropolis. All the\r\ninformation tends to show that the expenses of the funerals of persons\r\nin the condition of gentry are, on the average (inclusive of burial\r\ndues), much higher than the sum stated. From inquiries I have made as to\r\nthe practice in the offices of the Masters in Chancery, where executors’\r\naccounts are examined, I learn that if an undertaker’s bill is 60_l._ or\r\n70_l._ (exclusive of burial dues), for a person whose rank in life was\r\nthat of the clergy, officers of the army or navy, or members of the\r\nlegal or medical professions, “it would, according to all usage, be\r\nallowed as of course, and notwithstanding it should turn out that the\r\nestate was insolvent.”[15] The cost of the funerals of persons of rank\r\nand title, it will have been seen, varies from 1500_l._ to 1000_l._, or\r\n800_l._, or less, as it is a town or country funeral. The expenses of\r\nthe funerals of gentry of the better condition, it will have been seen,\r\nvary from 200_l._ to 400_l._, and are stated to be seldom so low as\r\n150_l._ § 45.\r\n\r\n§ 73. The average cost of funerals of persons of every rank above\r\npaupers in the metropolis may, therefore, be taken as 14_l._ 19_s._\r\n9_d._ per head. In some of the rural districts, and in the smaller\r\nprovincial towns, where the distinct business of an undertaker has not\r\narisen, coffins are made by carpenters, and services are supplied at a\r\nvery moderate cost; but the allowances from the benefit and burial clubs\r\nthroughout the country, of which instances have been given, may be\r\nstated as instances of the general expense to the labouring classes. To\r\npersons of the middle or higher classes, who give orders to undertakers\r\nin the metropolis, for funerals to be performed in the country, the\r\nexpense is further enhanced by the extra expense of carriage; so that\r\nthere is ground for believing that the same average prevails throughout\r\nGreat Britain, and that the total annual expense of funerals cannot be\r\nmuch less than between four and five millions per annum.\r\n\r\n§ 74. Out of 5_l._ expended for the common funeral of an adult artisan\r\nin the metropolis, about 15_s._ will be the burial dues. Of this 15_s._\r\nabout 3_s._ may be stated as the amount the clergyman will receive. The\r\nsurplice fees vary in different places from 2_s._ for the lowest class,\r\nrising with the condition to 5_l._ 5_s._, or more; but taking the\r\naverage of all cases which occur in the metropolis, and on the\r\nexperience of the ministers of several parishes, the burial fees, which\r\nform their chief emolument, that which was anciently denominated “Soul\r\nScot,” might perhaps be fairly taken as at 7_s._ 2_d._ per case, which\r\nis the average of the burial fees in some of the principal parishes in\r\nLondon.[16]\r\n\r\n_Different proportions of the Expenses of Burials to the Community in\r\nhealthy and unhealthy Districts._\r\n\r\n§ 75. It is a prevalent popular error, not unsanctioned by doctrines\r\nheld by several eminent public writers, that “as one disease disappears\r\nso another springs up,” that the positive “amount of mortality, the\r\ncommon lot,” is the same to all classes. But death, besides differing in\r\nthe period to different individuals, differs widely in the numbers of\r\nburials, and in the consequent expenses to different families, classes,\r\nand districts. It is the _number_ as well as the separate expense of\r\neach of the funerals which occur during the year to each _class_ of\r\npersons, or to different districts, which determines the total expense\r\nof burial to the class or district. Thus, to the poorer classes, living\r\nin wretched habitations, as those comprised in Bethnal Green and\r\nWhitechapel, there is one burial to every 31 of the inhabitants, whilst\r\nin the contiguous district of Hackney there is only one burial to every\r\n56 of the inhabitants yearly. In Liverpool there is one burial per annum\r\nto every 30 of the inhabitants, whilst in the county of Hereford there\r\nis one burial only to every 55 of the inhabitants. If the existing\r\ncharge of burial, at the above rates of expense to each class of\r\nindividuals, were commuted for an annual payment, commencing at birth,\r\nas a premium for the payment of 100_l._, 50_l._, and 5_l._, payable at\r\nthe undermentioned periods respectively, it would in the metropolis and\r\nthe county of Hereford be nearly as follows:—\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────────────┬───────────────────────\r\n         CLASS.         │      METROPOLIS.      │    HEREFORDSHIRE.\r\n ───────────────────────┼──────────┬────────────┼──────────┬────────────\r\n                        │          │   Annual   │          │   Annual\r\n                        │ Average  │Payment for │ Average  │Payment for\r\n                        │  Age at  │ Burial to  │  Age at  │ Burial to\r\n                        │  Death.  │   every    │  Death.  │   every\r\n                        │          │Individual. │          │Individual.\r\n ───────────────────────┼──────────┼────────────┼──────────┼────────────\r\n                        │  Years.  │£. _s._ _d._│  Years.  │£. _s._ _d._\r\n Gentry                 │    44    │1   1    10 │    45    │1   1    0\r\n Tradesmen or Farmers   │    25    │1   6     8 │    47    │0   9    9\r\n Labourers              │    22    │0   3     2 │    39    │0   2    9\r\n                        │    ——    │            │    ——    │\r\n Average of all Classes │    27    │            │    39    │\r\n ───────────────────────┴──────────┴────────────┴──────────┴────────────\r\n\r\nSupposing each member of the family to have been assured at birth, a\r\nlabourer’s family in Herefordshire consisting of five persons would have\r\nto pay yearly 13_s._ 9_d._, and there a farmer’s family of the same\r\nnumber would have to pay 2_l._ 8_s._ 9_d._ yearly; whilst in London for\r\nan artisan’s family of five, the yearly payment would be 15_s._ 10_d._\r\nand for a tradesman’s family it would be 6_l._ 13_s._ 4_d._ per annum.\r\nTo insure the payment of the average cost of funerals, 14_l._ 7_s._\r\n5_d._ at the end of 27 years, on the metropolitan chances of life, the\r\nannual payment would be 7_s._, whilst on the Herefordshire chances of\r\nlife of 39 years to all born high or low the sum would be only 4_s._ Or\r\nto take another form of displaying the comparative burthen; the general\r\naverage cost of each burial being 14_l._ 7_s._ 5_d._, and the annual\r\n_proportions_ of deaths being different from the average duration of\r\nlife—being 1 of every 40 in the metropolis, a poll-tax to defray the\r\nburial expenses must there be 7_s._ 2¼_d._; whilst in Hereford the\r\nproportions of deaths being one in every 55, the poll-tax on all of the\r\ninhabitants to meet the charge would be 5_s._ 3_d._ per head.\r\n\r\n§ 76. It appears, therefore, that in considering the means of relief\r\nfrom the evils connected with the number and expenses of burial, it\r\nshould at the same time be borne in mind that the primary means of\r\nabatement and relief of the misery of frequent funerals will be found in\r\nthe means of the removal of the developed and removable causes of\r\npremature mortality. Had the annual mortality amongst the population in\r\nthe high, open, and naturally-drained district of Hackney been the same\r\nproportionate amount of mortality as that in the contiguous, but low,\r\nill-drained, ill-cleansed, and ill-ventilated district of Bethnal Green\r\nand Whitechapel, instead of 759 deaths per annum, Hackney would have\r\nupwards of 1138 deaths, and an expense of 5448_l._ more for funerals\r\nduring the year than it has. So the county of Hereford, if it were\r\nafflicted with the same amount of mortality as that which prevails in\r\nLiverpool, would have 1488 more deaths annually and an additional\r\nexpenditure of 21,390_l._ per annum in burials. How directly, certainly,\r\nand powerfully, defective sanitary measures in respect of drainage and\r\ncleansing, bear upon health and life, and, by consequence, on the\r\nfrequency of burials, will be seen in the latter portions of the\r\nexamination of Mr. Blencarne, surgeon, one of the medical officers of\r\nthe City of London Union, and of Mr. Abraham, surgeon, one of the\r\nRegistrars of Deaths in the same Union; which I select as an instance,\r\nbecause the City stands high in wealth, in endowed charities, and in\r\nsupposed immunity from the removable or preventible causes of\r\ndisease.[17]\r\n\r\n§ 77. Two individual cases which were narrated by the physician who\r\nattended them, will serve to convey a conception of a large proportion\r\nof the common cases denoted by the units of the statistical evidence\r\nderived from towns, and will illustrate more clearly the economy of the\r\nprevention of sickness and death, as a superior economy of the incidents\r\nof sickness as well as of funerals.\r\n\r\nOne case was that of an intelligent industrious man who had been foreman\r\nto a tradesman, and having married and established himself as a master\r\ntradesman, had a family of children. To diminish the expense of his\r\nfamily he took a house which he let off to lodgers, retaining to himself\r\nonly the garrets and the underground or kitchen floor. He had five\r\nchildren who became unhealthy and were attacked with cachectic diseases\r\nand scald head; and the expense of an apothecary to the family during\r\none year was 59_l._: but still more serious disease afterwards\r\nappearing, a physician was called in, who perceiving the impure air of\r\nthe apartments, pointed out the causes of the varied illness which had\r\nprevailed, and the remedy—removal from the house.\r\n\r\nIn another case the foreman of a brewery married a healthy wife, who\r\ngave birth to seven children, of whom six died at various ages, while\r\nyoung, from diseases evidently springing from impure air. The source of\r\nthis impure air was an ill-constructed cesspool in the lower part of the\r\nhouse, the stench of which was pointed out by the physician, who\r\nhappened to have a perception of such causes, and advised the immediate\r\nremoval of the family. Since that time they have had two other children,\r\nwho with the third which escaped, are now living in their better lodging\r\nin the enjoyment of good health; the last of the children who died, when\r\n“ailing,” was sent to the purer atmosphere of a rural district, and\r\nreturned in robust health, but soon after his exposure to the impure\r\natmosphere was attacked with fever, of which he died within a fortnight.\r\n\r\nIt was in the power of neither of these persons to obtain an amendment\r\nof the general system of drainage, which occasioned the atmospheric\r\nimpurity under which they suffered; but the actual expenses of\r\nstructural measures of prevention would not, as an entire outlay, have\r\namounted to half the apothecary’s bill for drugs in the first case, or\r\nof the expenses of the funerals (superadded to the expenses of drugs) in\r\nthe second case; but if the expenses of those structural arrangements\r\nwere defrayed by an annual payment of instalments of principal and\r\ninterest, spread over a period of 30 years, or a period coincident with\r\nthe benefit, the expense of the extended or combined measure of\r\nprevention would not be more than 1_l._ 5_s._ 10_d._ per tenement, or\r\nperhaps a small proportion of that sum, to the individual family.[18]\r\n\r\n§ 78. But to return to collective examples. Mr. Blencarne, on a view of\r\nthe sanitary condition of the population, and the causes of mortality\r\nwithin his district, expresses a confident opinion that in that district\r\nthe average amount of mortality might be reduced one-third by efficient\r\nsanitary measures. The saving by a reduction of 71 funerals yearly, or\r\none-third of the burials in that district, at the average expense of\r\nfunerals for the metropolis, would amount to nearly 1020_l._ per annum.\r\nIf, as appears to be practicable, there were a reduction of one-half of\r\nthe expenses of the other two-thirds of the average number of funerals,\r\nthe total saving from this source would be 2040_l._ per annum to the\r\npopulation inhabiting, according to the last census, 1416 houses. Now\r\nthe annual share of the expense of the chief structural sanitary\r\narrangements, supposing every house in the district to be deficient,\r\nwould, on the proximate estimate, amount to a sum of 1829_l._, or less\r\nthan the amount saved by the reduction of the funeral expenditure,\r\ngiving the health and longevity, and all the moral and social savings,\r\n_plus_ the mere pecuniary saving; these remoter savings being in\r\nthemselves unquestionably far greater than can be represented by the\r\npecuniary items directly economised.\r\n\r\n§ 79. Whosoever will carefully examine what has been done in scattered\r\nand fortuitous instances amongst persons of the same class, following\r\nthe same occupation, living in the same neighbourhoods, and deriving the\r\nsame amount of incomes, and will from such examinations judge of the\r\ninferences as to what may be done by the more systematised application\r\nof the like means, will not deem the representation extravagant, that\r\nthe same duration of life may be given to the labouring classes that is\r\nenjoyed by professional persons of the first class; or that it is\r\npossible to attain for the whole of a town population such average\r\ndurations of life as are attained by portions of existing towns; or say,\r\nsuch an average as is attained by the population of the old town of\r\nGeneva, that is to say of 45 years, or six years higher than appears to\r\nbe attained by the whole population of the county of Hereford, which, as\r\nwe have seen, is 39 years.\r\n\r\n§ 80. To take another example. If the proportion of deaths to the\r\npopulation in the Whitechapel Union were reduced to the proportion of\r\ndeaths to the population in Herefordshire, then, instead of 2307\r\nburials, there would only be 1305 burials per annum; and if the cost of\r\nthe remaining burials were reduced 50 per cent. of the average present\r\ncost, then the saving of funeral expenses to the Whitechapel district\r\nwould be at the rate of more than 23,000_l._, or nearly 3_l._ per house\r\non the inhabited houses of the district; about half that sum being\r\ndeemed sufficient to defray the expense of the proposed structural\r\nimprovements. The funeral expenses in the parish of Hackney on the\r\nproportion of burials amongst them, are at the rate of 5_s._ 2_d._ per\r\nhead on the living population. Were the burials in Liverpool reduced to\r\nthe same proportion, 1 in 56 instead of 1 in 30,[19] at the rate of\r\nexpenses for funerals in London, nearly 50,000_l._ per annum would be\r\nsaved to the population of Liverpool, being more than sufficient to\r\nenable them to pay 30 years’ annual instalments, the principal and\r\ninterest, at five per cent., of a sum of 845,065_l._ sterling for\r\nstructural arrangements.\r\n\r\n§ 81. Strong barriers to the improvement of the sanitary condition of\r\nthe population are created by the common rule and practice of levying\r\nthe whole expense of permanent works, immediately or within short\r\nperiods, on persons who conceive they have no immediate interest in\r\nthem, or whose interest is really transient, and who under such\r\ncircumstances will see no _per contra_ of benefit to themselves to\r\ncompensate for the expenditure. It may be of use to exemplify the\r\n_contra_ of advantage to the inhabitants at least, to make it a good\r\neconomy to them to pay the proportions of rates required for the\r\nadditional expenditure in efficient means of preventing sickness and\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\nThe following may be given as an instance of the superior economy of\r\nprevention, by the appliance of vaccination, afforded by the experience\r\nobtained under the partial operation of the Vaccination Act in the\r\nmetropolis as compared with the experience in Glasgow, to which the same\r\narrangements do not extend. In the metropolis, in the year 1837, the\r\ndeaths from small-pox were 1520. The deaths from small-pox in the\r\nmetropolis, and in Glasgow for the years after the Vaccination Act came\r\ninto operation are thus compared in a report by Dr. R. D. Thompson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DEATHS FROM SMALL-POX.\r\n\r\n                    Glasgow.

The rate of\r\nreduced mortality from that disease has continued during the present\r\nyear; and the average of the present rate, as compared with the average\r\npreceding the extension of vaccination, would give a reduction of 946\r\ndeaths and funerals from 1652 annually. But as not one attack in ten of\r\nsmall-pox usually proves fatal, the reduction of the number of deaths\r\nmay be taken as representing a reduction of some 9,460 cases of\r\nsickness. The amount paid from the poor-rates for vaccination in the\r\nmetropolis was 1701_l._, which at the average fee gives 22,680 of the\r\nworst conditioned and most susceptible cases out of about 56,000, in\r\nwhich vaccination was successfully performed. The attention directed to\r\nthe subject has also promoted the extension of vaccination, by others\r\nthan the appointed vaccinators. The various expenses of each case of\r\nsickness to the sufferers, inclusive of medicines, may perhaps, on a low\r\nestimate, be represented at 1_l._ each case; and taking half the average\r\nexpenses of funerals for the 946 funerals saved, the total expense of\r\nfunerals and of sickness saved by the expenditure of the sum stated of\r\n1701_l._ in well-directed measures of prevention, would exceed\r\n16,000_l._ in the metropolis alone. Throughout the whole country, the\r\ndeaths from small-pox in 1840 were 10,434, as compared with 16,268 in\r\n1838, on which, if the reduction may be ascribed to the extension of\r\nvaccination solely, pounds of immediate expenses must have been saved by\r\nthe expenditure of half crowns,—in other words, upwards of 90,000_l._ in\r\nmoney has been saved by the expenditure of about 12,000_l._ in\r\nvaccination.\r\n\r\nThe excess of deaths in the metropolis above the healthy standard of\r\nIslington or Herefordshire, of 1 in 55, is 11,266 (vide returns,\r\nAppendix); the expense of burial of this excessive number, at the\r\naverage cost, is 168,990_l._ per annum, which (without taking into\r\naccount the expenses of the corresponding excess of sickness) as an\r\ninstalment, would in 30 years liquidate the principal and interest, at 5\r\nper cent., of a loan of 2,856,168_l._ towards house drainings and the\r\nstructural improvements and arrangements, by which the excess might be\r\nprevented. To the charge of the excessive deaths must be added the\r\ncharge of the births which take place to make up the ravages of the\r\nmortality in the most depressed districts. Taking the proportion of the\r\nbirths to the population in the Hackney Union, 1 in 42, as the standard\r\nof proportion of births in a healthy district, the excess of births for\r\nthe whole metropolis during that year was upwards of 8000: or 52,609\r\ninstead of 44,541.[21]\r\n\r\n§ 82. The grounds will hereafter be submitted which appear to sustain\r\nthe position that all the solemnity of sepulture may be increased, and\r\nsolemnity given where none is now obtained, concurrently with a great\r\nreduction of expense to all classes.—Vide post, § 113 to § 120.\r\n\r\nIn considering the expenses of funerals, the arrangements and consequent\r\nexpenses of the funerals of the wealthy are of importance, less perhaps\r\nfor themselves than as governing by example the arrangements and\r\nexpenses of the poorest classes, even to the adoption of such\r\narrangements, and consequently expensive outlay as to have hired bearers\r\nand mutes with silk fittings even at the funerals of common labourers.\r\nThe expenditure by the wealthy, in compliance with supposed demands at\r\nwhich their own taste revolts, for a transient effect which is not\r\ngained,[22] would suffice to produce permanent effects of beneficence\r\nand taste worthy of their position in society. A gentleman who recently,\r\nin distaste of the ordinary undertaker’s arrangements, reduced them on\r\nthe occasion of the burial of his daughter, applied the money in\r\nerecting to her memory, and partly endowing, a small school for 25\r\nchildren of a village, in which, as the tablet on the school recorded,\r\nthe deceased had, when alive, taken a kindly interest. Where no such\r\nobjects are offered for the surplus expenditure, that which would be\r\nunsuccessfully thrown away for the transient effect would suffice for a\r\nstatue or some work of art that would ensure permanent admiration. The\r\naggregate waste on funerals in the metropolis would, in the course of a\r\nshort time, suffice for the endowment of educational or other\r\ninstitutions, that would go far to retrieve the condition of the poorer\r\nclasses. The waste of two years in the metropolis would suffice for the\r\nerection of a magnificent cathedral, and of a third year for its\r\nendowment for ever.\r\n\r\n§ 83. In justification of the funeral exactions from the labouring\r\nclasses, it is sometimes alleged that if they did not expend the money\r\nin the funereal decorations, they would expend it in drink. But this\r\nwould only occur in a minority of cases, and in those only for a time.\r\nThe reduction would be an immediate and most important relief in an\r\nimmense number of cases of widowhood, and especially in those cases\r\nwhere there has been no insurance, where the widow incurs debts which\r\noften reduce her to destitution and dependence on the poor’s rates, or\r\non charity. It forms a large part of the business of some of the\r\nsmall-debt courts in the metropolis to enforce payments of the\r\nundertakers’ bills, incurred under such circumstances. For all classes,\r\nwhat is deemed by them respectful interment is to be considered a\r\nnecessity; and in general the expenditure beyond what is necessary to\r\nensure such interment competes not with extravagancy, but with high\r\nmoral obligations. By the arrangements which throw the savings of the\r\npoor family into the grave, children are left destitute, and creditors\r\nare often defrauded, and heavy taxes levied on the sympathies of\r\nneighbours and friends.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Failure of the objects of the common Expenditure on Funerals._\r\n\r\n§ 84. Notwithstanding the immense sacrifices made by the labouring\r\nclasses for the purpose, neither they nor the middle classes obtain\r\nsolemn and respectful interment, nor does it appear practicable that\r\nthey should obtain it by any arrangement of the present parochial means\r\nof interment in crowded districts.\r\n\r\n§ 85. Few persons can have witnessed funeral processions passing in\r\nmid-day through the thronged and busy streets of the metropolis, without\r\nbeing struck with the extreme inappropriateness of the times and places\r\nchosen for such processions. This want of regulation as to appropriate\r\ntimes is the subject of complaints, which must attach, even to a greater\r\nextent, to numerous processions, without regulation, from the centre of\r\nthe populous town districts to the suburbs.\r\n\r\nMr. Wild, the undertaker, was asked—\r\n\r\n  What besides the expense, and the objection to the ground, do you\r\n  find is the objection entertained to the existing mode of burial in\r\n  the crowded districts of the metropolis?—One very common objection,\r\n  is the inconvenient time; the average time is about 3 o’clock, but\r\n  it varies from 2 to 4 o’clock. This is very inconvenient for persons\r\n  in business, who wish to attend as mourners. From this cause,\r\n  interments are frequently delayed; at this time, also, the streets\r\n  are very much crowded; sometimes boys crowd round the gates, and\r\n  shout as ill-educated boys usually do; sometimes there are mobs; I\r\n  have known the service interrupted more than once during the\r\n  ceremony; sometimes the adults of the mob will make rude remarks. I\r\n  have heard them call out to the clergyman, “Read out, old fellow;”\r\n  sometimes I have known them make rude remarks in the hearing of the\r\n  mourners; on the clergyman frequently; but this has been on the week\r\n  days, when, of course, the numbers attending are very great. At\r\n  times, the adults and mob at the gates have an idle and rude\r\n  curiosity to hear the service. I have known them rush in past the\r\n  mourners, and go in indiscriminately. It is part of my business to\r\n  see the mourners and corpse safe in, before I go in; and I have been\r\n  sometimes severely hustled, and have had great difficulty in getting\r\n  in myself.\r\n\r\n  Are the crowds in the town, or districts, ever characterized by any\r\n  reverence for the dead?—Not the slightest: quite the contrary, and\r\n  it makes part of the annoyance of interments in town to have to\r\n  encounter them.\r\n\r\n  Are you not aware that on the Continent it is generally the custom\r\n  for passengers of every condition in the streets, to stop and take\r\n  off the hat, on the approach, and during the passage of the dead?—I\r\n  have met with several instances of persons stopping in our streets\r\n  in London, and taking off their hats. On looking at them, I had\r\n  reason to believe they were foreigners.\r\n\r\n  Have you ever known carriages or common coaches, or carts or\r\n  waggons, stop in the streets on the approach of a funeral?—I have\r\n  seen gentlemen pull their check-strings, or tap at their windows,\r\n  and stop their coachmen in towns; but, if the carriage were empty,\r\n  there was no stoppage. But none of the common conveyances ever stop.\r\n  I have several times ran the risk of being knocked down by them. I\r\n  have known cabmen and omnibus men drive through the procession of a\r\n  walking funeral, and separate the mourners from the corpse. These\r\n  characters display complete indifference to such scenes.\r\n\r\n§ 86. In the rural districts the population appears to be so far better\r\ninstructed and more respectful; but, according to the testimony of\r\nliving persons, the same indifference has not always characterized\r\nlabouring classes in the town districts, even of the metropolis. It is\r\ndescribed as an unavoidable consequence of the increasing numbers of\r\nfunerals, and familiarity with them arising from the neglect of\r\nappropriate general arrangements, a neglect from which not only the\r\nrelations and parties engaged in such services, but strangers have to\r\ncomplain, that their feelings are not duly regarded. In a rural parish,\r\nthe deceased who is interred is generally known, and the single funeral\r\narrests attention and excites sympathy. In crowded districts\r\nneighbourship diminishes; a vast portion of the population of the\r\nmetropolis pass their lives without knowing their next-door neighbours,\r\nor even persons living in the same building; the great majority of\r\nburials are, to the mass of the population, burials of strangers, for\r\nwhom no personal sympathies can be awakened; the inopportune and\r\nunexpected passage of small funeral processions through busy and\r\nunprepared crowds of the young and active, create a familiarity that\r\nstifles all respectful or reverential feelings, whilst the numbers of\r\nseparate funerals make undue demands on the sympathies, and harass the\r\nminds of the sickly and the solitary by their continued passage, and the\r\nperpetual tollings of the passing bells. Examples in some of the German\r\ncities might be cited of refined and successful arrangements by which\r\nthe feelings of all are consulted, by interments either in the quiet of\r\nevening or of early morning, or by the selection of retired routes for\r\nthe processions. The funeral processions to the cemetery of Frankfort\r\nare generally held at early morning for the labouring classes.\r\n\r\n§ 87. The celebration of religious ceremonies in a satisfactory manner\r\nat some of the populous parishes, appear to be often extremely\r\ndifficult, if not impracticable. Mr. Wild further answers:—\r\n\r\n  What are the matters objected to that are of common experience in\r\n  our burials, when the corpse and attendants have arrived within the\r\n  church-yard?—In certain seasons of the year, when the mortality is\r\n  greater than usual, a number of funerals, according to the present\r\n  regulation of the churchyards, are named for one hour. During last\r\n  Sunday, for example, there were fifteen funerals all fixed during\r\n  one hour at one church. Some of these will be funerals in the\r\n  church; those which have not an in-door service must wait outside.\r\n  At the church to which I refer, there were six parties of mourners\r\n  waiting outside. My man informed me, that all these parties of\r\n  mourners were kept nearly three-quarters of an hour waiting outside,\r\n  without any cover, and with no boards to stand upon. The weather\r\n  last Sunday was dreadfully inclement. I have seen ten funerals kept\r\n  waiting in the church-yard from twenty minutes to three-quarters of\r\n  an hour. I have known colds caught on the ground by parties kept\r\n  waiting, and more probably occurred than I could know of. It is the\r\n  practice on such occasions to say the service over the bodies of\r\n  children and over the bodies of the adults together, and sometimes\r\n  the whole are kept waiting until the number is completed. Even under\r\n  these circumstances, the ceremony is frequently very much hurried.\r\n\r\n  How many are there in some parochial burial grounds to be buried at\r\n  one time?—Sometimes fifteen.\r\n\r\n  With such a number to bury is it physically possible that the\r\n  separate service should be other than hurried, and in so far as it\r\n  is hurried unsatisfactory to the mourners?—According to the present\r\n  system I do not see that it is at all times practicable to be other\r\n  than hurried and unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n  Would not an in-door service be acceptable to the labouring\r\n  classes?—I conceive highly so. In some parishes, as at Camberwell,\r\n  the custom is to give an in-door service to all, whether rich or\r\n  poor. This is considered highly acceptable. Where the labouring\r\n  classes are excluded they not only feel the inconvenience of having\r\n  to wait, but they feel very much the exclusion on account of their\r\n  poverty. They frequently complain to me, and question me as to\r\n  whether it is right, and ask me the reason.\r\n\r\n  What other inconveniences are experienced in the service in\r\n  church-yards?—It is a frequent thing that a grave-digger, who smells\r\n  strongly of liquor, will ask of the widow or mourners for something\r\n  to drink, and, if not given, he will follow them to the gates and\r\n  outside the gates, murmuring and uttering reproaches.\r\n\r\n  Is that ordinarily the last thing met with before leaving the\r\n  church-yards?—Yes, that is the last thing.\r\n\r\n  That closes the scene?—Yes, that closes the scene.\r\n\r\nMr. Dix was asked—\r\n\r\n  In the crowded districts is the funeral ceremony often\r\n  impeded?—Besides the state of the parochial burial grounds, the mode\r\n  of performing the ceremony is very objectionable, in consequence of\r\n  the crowd and noise and bustle in the neighbourhood. I have had\r\n  burials to perform in St. Clements Danes’ burial ground, when the\r\n  noise of the passing and the repassing of the vehicles has been such\r\n  that we have not heard a third of the service, except in broken\r\n  sentences.\r\n\r\n§ 88. On this very important subject it is observed, by the Reverend\r\nWilliam Stone, the rector of Spitalfields:—\r\n\r\n  It must, I think, be admitted, that, in a crowded population, the\r\n  parochial system, as it generally stands at present, is utterly\r\n  inadequate to meet the demand for interment—the demand, I mean,\r\n  which would exist, if that system were universally acquiesced in,\r\n  and all our parishioners were brought for interment to our parochial\r\n  burial grounds. To say nothing of the inability of many parishes to\r\n  provide adequate grounds, there could not be an adequate supply of\r\n  clergymen or of churches. Indeed, it has always seemed to me, that,\r\n  in practice, this _has been_ admitted; for, in London, that\r\n  considerable and important part of the burial service which is\r\n  performed within the church, unless specially desired and paid for,\r\n  has, from time almost immemorial, been left out; and I think that\r\n  the highest ecclesiastical authorities could hardly have introduced\r\n  or sanctioned such an anti-rubrical omission, had it not served some\r\n  more popular or more necessary purpose than that of merely raising\r\n  the fees of the church. From this consideration, added to the\r\n  frequent inconvenience of my burial services, I have been led to\r\n  regard the fees for the in-church service, like the payments for the\r\n  erection of monuments and tablets in our churches, as a kind of\r\n  necessary preventive duty. And certain it is, that unless our burial\r\n  services were limited by some such restrictive system, they would be\r\n  not only overwhelmingly laborious, but absolutely impracticable and\r\n  incompatible with our other professional engagements. How, for\r\n  instance, could the densely-built parish of Christchurch,\r\n  Spitalfields, yielding a clerical income less than 380_l._ a-year,\r\n  possessing one burial-ground, and one church attached to that\r\n  burial-ground, accommodate, in any enlarged sense of the word, an\r\n  _interrable_ population of 23,642, with the addition of the many\r\n  proprietors of our vaults and graves, who must always be resident at\r\n  a distance? Even now, with our present very scanty demand for\r\n  interment, I sometimes find, as I have intimated, extreme\r\n  inconvenience from this part of my duties. For obvious reasons the\r\n  working classes make choice of Sunday for their burials; the very\r\n  day, above all others, when the clergy and the church are almost\r\n  wholly pre-engaged for other purposes. No wonder, then, that one\r\n  purpose should often clash with another—that burials _in_ church\r\n  should clash with burials _out_ of it—that clergymen should be\r\n  hurried, discomposed, and exhausted—and mourners kept waiting in a\r\n  cold, damp burial-ground, so as to verify the old objection urged by\r\n  the Puritans against our service there, that “in burying the dead we\r\n  kill the living.” On other days, too, the clergy have other\r\n  engagements, so as to render it necessary to appoint burials for a\r\n  particular hour—an appointment, however, often more necessary to the\r\n  clergy than agreeable to the undertakers and their employers. And\r\n  yet, with every precaution, the clergyman is most seriously\r\n  incommoded; for, however he may try to accommodate, by allowing\r\n  parties to fix their own hour of burial, his time and patience are\r\n  fearfully encroached upon. Burials are very seldom punctual. They\r\n  arrive from 20 minutes up to an hour and a half after the hour\r\n  fixed. Mourners linger at home over their cups. The undertaker\r\n  pleads that he “couldn’t get them to move.” Sometimes he has another\r\n  “job” in hand elsewhere—nay, an undertaker has had two “jobs” in my\r\n  own burial ground—he has fixed them for the same hour; yet, after\r\n  having, with my assistance, completed one of them, he has coolly\r\n  left me to wait till he could fetch the other; so that, what with\r\n  wasted time, exhausted patience, and trials of temper owing to\r\n  incivility and other annoyances from such persons as a clergyman is\r\n  thus brought into contact with, he has, to say the least, as much\r\n  inconvenience as the public have to complain of.\r\n\r\n  Among the inconveniences which the necessities of our parochial\r\n  system impose upon the working-classes, may be mentioned the\r\n  practice just now alluded to, viz., the omission of the _in_-church\r\n  service in all cases where it is not specially paid for. Looking at\r\n  my parishioners in a religious light, and at a moment when all ranks\r\n  and conditions are literally levelled in the dust, I feel this to be\r\n  an invidious distinction between rich and poor; and I think it but\r\n  natural that the poor should prefer burial in places where such a\r\n  distinction is less strongly marked.\r\n\r\nIn another part of his highly important communication, he observes—\r\n\r\n  In the course of my remarks I have adverted to our inadequate\r\n  parochial provision for the burial of the dead in populous places,\r\n  and to the consequent inconvenience which has placed the churchyard\r\n  in unfavourable contrast with the dissenting ground. There is\r\n  another inconvenience, however, which attaches to both, and which is\r\n  inseparable from the burial of the dead in a crowded population: I\r\n  mean the impossibility of maintaining a due solemnity on such an\r\n  occasion.\r\n\r\n  If the working-classes of a populous city are less awfully affected\r\n  by the sight of death, from an unavoidable familiarity with it in\r\n  their own homes, it is to be feared that they and others meet with\r\n  much to prevent or impair a wholesome sensibility upon it in public;\r\n  for there the touching associations of a burial, and the sublime\r\n  spirituality of our burial office are broken in upon by the\r\n  exhibition of the most vulgar and even ludicrous scenes of daily\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  The eastern end of my parish ground, for instance, abuts upon\r\n  Brick-lane, one of our most crowded and noisy thoroughfares, and at\r\n  one corner stands a public-house, which, of course, is not without\r\n  its attraction to all orders of street minstrels. In performing the\r\n  burial service, I have left the church, while the organ has been\r\n  playing a beautiful and impressive requiem movement, and proceeded\r\n  to the grave, where it was purely accidental if I did not hear the\r\n  very inappropriate tune mentioned by my medical friend.\r\n\r\n  Indeed, as my church extends along one side of another crowded\r\n  street, I have had most inappropriate musical accompaniments, even\r\n  during that part of the burial service which is performed _within_\r\n  the church. My burial ground is partially exposed to the street at\r\n  the west end also; and there, as at the east, it is liable to be\r\n  invaded by sounds and sights of the most incongruous description.\r\n  Boys clamber up the outside of the wall, hang upon the railing, and,\r\n  as if tempted by the effect of contrast, take a wanton delight in\r\n  the noisy utterance of the most familiar, disrespectful, and\r\n  offensive expressions;—of course, all attempts to put down this\r\n  nuisance from within the burial ground serve only to aggravate it,\r\n  and nothing _could_ put it down but a police force ordered to the\r\n  outside every time that a burial takes place. To this\r\n  wilful disturbance is added the usual uproar of a crowded\r\n  thoroughfare,—whistling, calling, shouting, street-cries, and the\r\n  creaking and rattling of every kind of vehicle—the whole forming\r\n  such a scene of noisy confusion as sometimes to make me inaudible.\r\n  On all these occasions, indeed, I labour under the indescribable\r\n  uneasiness of feeling myself out of place. Amidst such a reckless\r\n  din of secular traffic, I feel as if I were prostituting the\r\n  spirituality of prayer, and profaning even the symbolical sanctity\r\n  of my surplice. And yet, the exposure of my burial-ground is but\r\n  partial, and is little or nothing compared with that of many others.\r\n  The ground is hardly less desecrated by the scenes within it; on\r\n  Sundays, especially, it is the resort of the idle, who pass by the\r\n  church and its services to lounge and gaze in the churchyard. It is\r\n  made a play-ground by children of both sexes, who skip and scamper\r\n  about it, and, if checked by our officers, will often retort with\r\n  impertinence, abuse, obscenity, or profaneness. I generally have to\r\n  force my way to a grave through a crowd of gossips, and as often to\r\n  pause in the service, to intimate that the murmurs of some or the\r\n  loud talk of others will not allow me to proceed. I hardly ever\r\n  witness in any of these crowds any indication of a religious\r\n  sentiment. I may sometimes chance to observe a serious shake of the\r\n  head among them; but, with these rare exceptions, I see them\r\n  impressed with no better feeling than the desire to while away their\r\n  time in gratifying a vulgar curiosity. On the burial of any\r\n  notorious character,—of a suicide, of a man who has perished by\r\n  manslaughter, of a woman who has died in child-birth, or even of a\r\n  child who has been killed by being run over in the street, this\r\n  vulgar excitement rises to an insufferable height. If, in such a\r\n  case, the corpse is brought into my church, this sacred and\r\n  beautiful structure is desecrated and disfigured by the hurried\r\n  intrusion of a squalid and irreverent mob, and clergyman, corpse,\r\n  and mourners are jostled and mixed up with the confused mass, by the\r\n  uncontrollable pressure from without. I will not, indeed, venture to\r\n  say that, on these occasions, the mourners always feel and dislike\r\n  this uproar, for I believe that among the working classes they often\r\n  congratulate themselves upon it. There is an éclat about it which\r\n  ministers to the love of petty distinction before alluded to; but,\r\n  whether through the operation of this feeling or the many other\r\n  abominable mischiefs attending the burial of the dead in populous\r\n  places, there is much to counteract or impair the solemn and\r\n  impressive effect of religious obsequies.\r\n\r\n§ 89. The feeling of a large proportion of the population appears to be\r\ndissatisfaction with the intra-mural parochial interments, less on\r\nsanitary grounds than from an aversion to the profanation arising from\r\ninterment amidst the scenes of the crowd and bustle of every-day life.\r\nThis feeling is manifested in the increasing numbers who abandon the\r\ninterments, even in parishes where the places of burial are neatly kept,\r\nwhere, if there be nothing to satisfy, there is nothing to offend the\r\neye, where the service is solemnly and attentively performed, and where\r\nthe amount of the burial fees cannot be supposed to influence the\r\nchoice. The increasing feeling of aversion is indeed manifested by acts\r\nless liable to error than any verbal testimony, by the increasing\r\nabandonment of parochial family-vaults by the gentry and middle classes\r\nof the population, by payments from the labouring classes, even of\r\nincreased burial dues for interments in places apart from the\r\nprofanation of every-day life. The feeling manifested may be stated to\r\nbe a national one, and to call for measures of a corresponding extent\r\nand character.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Means of diminishing the evil of the retention of the Remains of the\r\n                        Dead amidst the Living._\r\n\r\nThe most predominant of the physical, if not of the moral evils which\r\nfollow the train of death, to the labouring classes, being the long\r\nretention of the corpse in their one room, the means of altering this\r\npractice claims priority in the consideration of remedies.\r\n\r\n§ 90. The delay of interment, it has been shown, is greatly increased by\r\nthe expense of the funerals; but in a considerable proportion of cases,\r\nwhere the expense is provided for, the delay still occurs, chiefly from\r\nfeelings which require to be consulted,—the fear of interment before\r\nlife is extinct.\r\n\r\n§ 91. It has been proposed by an arbitrary enactment, without\r\nqualification or provision of securities, to forbid all delay of\r\ninterments beyond a certain number of hours. Such a provision would, in\r\nthe shape proposed, and without other securities, run counter to the\r\nfeelings of the population, and standing as a self-executing law it\r\nwould have but little operation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed compulsory clause stood thus in the bill of the session of\r\n1842 without any qualification:—\r\n\r\n  “And be it enacted, That from and after the First day of October,\r\n  One thousand eight hundred and forty, if any dead body shall\r\n  continue unburied between the First day of May and the Thirty-first\r\n  day of October, both days inclusive, more than       hours, or\r\n  between the First day of November and the Thirtieth day of April,\r\n  both days inclusive, more than       hours, the executors or\r\n  administrators to the estate and effects of such deceased person, or\r\n  the friends or relatives of the same, or any one of such friends or\r\n  relatives present at the burial, or the occupier of the house from\r\n  which such dead body shall be removed to be buried, shall forfeit\r\n  the sum of Twenty shillings for every Twenty-four hours after the\r\n  expiration of such respective periods.”\r\n\r\nFrom the closeness of the rooms in which the poorer classes die, and\r\nfrom large fires being on such occasions lighted in them, decomposition\r\noften proceeds with as much rapidity in winter as in summer. The mental\r\nsufferings from the prolonged retention of the body amidst the living,\r\n§§ 26, 3, 39, and the moral objections to it also, § 42, would be as\r\nintense in the winter as in the summer, or more so.\r\n\r\n§ 92. In several of the continental states, about half a century ago,\r\nsimilar enactments were passed; but it was found necessary to accompany\r\nthem with various securities; and where these securities, such as the\r\nmedical inspection and certificate before interment, have been loose,\r\nevents have occurred which have convinced the public of the necessity of\r\nstrengthening them. In a recent report on the subject at Paris, by M.\r\nOrfila, he adduces an instance.\r\n\r\n  “In October, 1837, M. Deschamps, an inhabitant of la Guillotière, at\r\n  Lyons, died at the end of a short indisposition. His obsequies were\r\n  ordered for the next day. On the next day the priests and the\r\n  vergers, the corpse-bearers and conductors of funerals, attended. At\r\n  the moment when they were about to nail down the lid of the coffin,\r\n  the corpse rose in its shroud, sat upright, and asked for something\r\n  to eat. The persons present were about to run away in terror, as\r\n  from a phantom, but they were re-assured by M. Deschamps himself,\r\n  who happily recovered from a lethargic sleep, which had been\r\n  mistaken for death. Due cares were bestowed upon him, and he lived.\r\n  After his recovery he stated that in his state of lethargy he had\r\n  heard all that had passed around him, without being able to make any\r\n  movement, or to give any expression to his sensations. * * * It is\r\n  fortunate for M. Deschamps that the funeral, which was to have taken\r\n  place in the evening, was deferred until the morning, when the\r\n  lethargic access terminated, otherwise he would have been interred\r\n  alive.” * *\r\n\r\nIn the last number of the Annales d’Hygiene, the following recent\r\ninstances are cited, as proving the necessity of a regular verification\r\nthroughout the kingdom of the fact of death:—\r\n\r\n  A midwife of the commune of Paulhan (Hérault) was believed to be\r\n  dead and was put in a coffin. At the expiration of twenty-four hours\r\n  she was carried to the church and from thence to the cemetery. But\r\n  during its progress the bearers felt some movement in the coffin,\r\n  and were surprised and frightened. They stopped and opened the\r\n  coffin, when they found the unfortunate woman alive! she had merely\r\n  fallen into a lethargy. She was carried back to her home, but in\r\n  consequence of the shock she received she only survived a few days\r\n  the horrible accident.\r\n\r\nIt is stated from Bergerac (Dordogne), of the date of the 27th of\r\nDecember, 1842, that—\r\n\r\n  An individual of the Commune d’Eymet, who suffered from the\r\n  continued want of sleep, having consulted a medical practitioner,\r\n  took on his prescription a potion which certainly caused sleep; but\r\n  the patient slept always, and the prolongation of the repose created\r\n  great anxiety, and occasioned his being bled. The blood flowed\r\n  feebly, drop by drop. Then he was declared to be dead. At the\r\n  expiration of a few days, however, the potion given to the patient\r\n  was remembered, and an uneasy sensation that it might have been the\r\n  cause of an apparent death, caused the exhumation of the body. When\r\n  the coffin was opened the horrible fact was apparent to all present\r\n  that the unfortunate man had really been buried alive; he had turned\r\n  round in the coffin! His distorted limbs showed that he had long\r\n  struggled against death.\r\n\r\nIn the “Journal des Débats,” bearing date February 21, 1843, a letter is\r\ngiven from Caen of the 17th February, informing us “that Madame * * *\r\ndwelling in the Rue Saint-Jean, appeared, after a long sickness, to\r\nexpire on Tuesday evening. The sad functions of preparing her for the\r\ntomb were performed during the night. On the Thursday morning the coffin\r\nwas brought, and as the two men were about to lay her in it, she moved\r\nin their hands, and woke up from the profound lethargy in which she was\r\nplunged. Madame * * * is in a state of health which leaves little hope.\r\nWe shudder to contemplate the horrible end which awaited her if the\r\ntrance had continued some hours longer.”\r\n\r\n§ 93. I am informed of one case, which occurred in a private family in\r\nthis country, of a disentombment, made under very similar circumstances\r\nto those of the case related from Bergerac, which revealed a similarly\r\nhorrible event, the body being found turned in the coffin. The belief of\r\nthe occurrence of such cases in this country is sometimes founded on\r\nstatements of the bodies being found out of their proper position in the\r\ncoffins; but nothing is more probable than the discomposure of the body\r\nfrom its recumbent position, by jolting at the time of its removal down\r\nsteep and narrow staircases. Sir Benjamin Brodie observes:—“Mistakes\r\nsuch as these here alluded to must be very rare, and can be the result\r\nonly of the grossest neglect. The movements of respiration are always\r\nperceptible to the eye, and cannot be overlooked by any one who does not\r\nchoose to overlook them, and there is no doubt that the heart never\r\ncontinues to act more than four or five minutes after respiration has\r\nentirely ceased. But it is not always easy to say what is the _exact\r\nmoment_ at which death hath taken place, as in some instances the\r\ninspirations for some time previously are repeated at very long\r\nintervals. Thus I have watched a dying person, and supposed that he was\r\ndead, when, after a minute’s interval, there has been a fresh\r\ninspiration; then one or two more presently afterwards; then another\r\nlong interval, and so on. I have no doubt that persons in this condition\r\nare often sensible, and even hear and understand all that is said.\r\n\r\n“It may be doubtful whether sensibility is always immediately\r\nextinguished when the heart has ceased to act. In persons who have died\r\nof the Asiatic cholera convulsive movements of the body have been\r\nobserved even several hours after apparent death. If the nervous system\r\nhas remained in such a state as this implies, who can say that it did\r\nnot retain its sensibility? There is no account of persons in whom such\r\nconvulsions (after apparent death) have taken place having recovered;\r\nbut this occurrence, even without chance of recovery, forms a strong\r\nargument against the immediate burial of persons who have died of the\r\ncholera.”[24]\r\n\r\n§ 94. The extreme ignorance and terror of the lowest class of the\r\npopulation on the occurrence of a death which they may never have\r\nwitnessed before, must be expected to stand in the place of gross\r\nneglect. Of the lower class of officers in public establishments, when\r\nunsuperintended by well qualified and responsible persons, the\r\noccurrence of gross neglect must be anticipated. Cases have recently\r\noccurred, and have at other times, though rarely, occurred, where the\r\nsick are laid out for dead, who have afterwards recovered. “To the\r\nskilful medical practitioner,” says Dr. Paris, (Paris and Fonblanque’s\r\nMedical Jurisprudence, vol. ii., p. 44,) “we apprehend such signs must\r\never be unequivocal, but we are not prepared to say that common\r\nobservers may not be deceived by them.” And he adduces instances where\r\nthey have been. He cites the testimony of Howard, who, in his work on\r\nprisons, says, “I have known instances where persons supposed to be dead\r\nof the gaol fever, and brought out for burial, on being washed with cold\r\nwater have shown signs of life, and have soon afterwards recovered.”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Paris also states that—\r\n\r\n  At the period when the small-pox raged with such epidemic fury, and\r\n  physicians so greatly aggravated its violence by their stimulating\r\n  plan of cure, there can be no doubt but that many persons were\r\n  condemned as dead who afterwards recovered; amongst the numerous\r\n  cases that might be cited in support of this opinion, the following\r\n  may be considered as well authenticated:—the daughter of Henry\r\n  Lawrens, the first president of the American Congress, when an\r\n  infant was laid out as dead, in the small-pox; upon which the window\r\n  of the apartment, that had been carefully closed during the progress\r\n  of the disease, was thrown open to ventilate the chamber, when the\r\n  fresh air revived the supposed corpse, and restored her to her\r\n  family; this circumstance occasioned in the father so powerful a\r\n  dread of living interment, that he directed by will that his body\r\n  should be burnt, and enjoined on his children the performance of\r\n  this wish as a sacred duty. We can also imagine, that women after\r\n  the exhaustion consequent on severe and protracted labours may lie\r\n  for some time in a state so like that of death, as to deceive the\r\n  by-standers; a very extraordinary case of this kind is related in\r\n  the Journal de Savans, Janvier 1749.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Gordon Smith, in his work on Forensic Medicine, has observed,\r\n  that in cases of precipitancy or confusion, as in times of public\r\n  sickness, the living have not unfrequently been mingled with the\r\n  dead, and that in warm climates, where speedy interment is more\r\n  necessary than in temperate and cold countries, persons have been\r\n  entombed alive. We feel no hesitation in believing that such an\r\n  event _may be possible_; but the very case with which the author\r\n  illustrates his position is sufficient to convince us that its\r\n  occurrence would be highly culpable, and could only arise from the\r\n  most unpardonable inattention: “I was,” says Dr. Smith, “an eye\r\n  witness of an instance in a celebrated city on the continent, where\r\n  a poor woman, yet alive, was solemnly ushered to the margin of the\r\n  grave in broad day, and whose interment would have deliberately\r\n  taken place, but for the interposition of the by-standers.” If the\r\n  casual observer was thus able to detect the signs of animation, the\r\n  case is hardly one that should have been adduced to show the\r\n  difficulty of deciding between real and apparent death.\r\n\r\nAlthough the chances may be as millions to one against such a horrible\r\noccurrence, yet the existence of the painful feeling of the possibility\r\nof such an event, even if the apprehended possibility were utterly\r\nunreal, is as valid ground for the adoption of measures to prevent and\r\nalleviate the painful feeling, as if the danger were real and frequent.\r\nA large proportion of the population, especially in Scotland, are deeply\r\nimpressed with the horror of being buried alive. Amongst the\r\nworking-classes the feeling is sometimes manifested in a dying request\r\nthat they may not be “hurried at once to the grave.”\r\n\r\nOne consequence of abandoning the rite of burial, as a trade and source\r\nof emolument to persons without instruction or qualification, who employ\r\nfor important ministrations agents of the lowest class, § 51, is, that\r\nonly the superficial, ceremonial, and profitable portions of the service\r\nare usually attended to, and that important private and public\r\nsecurities are lost. One of the proper ministrations after death, a\r\npurification or ablution of the body, is generally omitted. On\r\ninquiring, as to the effects produced amongst the lower class of Irish\r\nby the retention of the body amidst the survivors under circumstances of\r\nimminent danger, a comparative immunity has been ascribed to the\r\npractice which they maintain of washing the corpse immediately after\r\ndeath. Amongst the lower class of the English and Scotch population of\r\nthe towns, this important sanitary rite is extensively neglected, and\r\nthe corpse is generally kept (except the face) with the _sordes_ of\r\ndisease upon it. The occurrence of such cases as have already been\r\nmentioned, § 31 and § 40, of the propagation by contact of diseases of a\r\nmalignant character, may probably be sometimes ascribed to this neglect.\r\nThe ablution, whether with tepid or cold water, as a general practice,\r\nis a protection against cases of protracted syncope or suspended\r\nanimation. Besides these cases, there are others of a judicial nature\r\nwhich cannot be termed extraordinary amidst a population where deaths\r\nfrom accidents or one description of violence or other, a large\r\nproportion of them involving criminality, amount in England and Wales\r\nalone to between 11,000 and 12,000 per annum. Cases have occurred of\r\nviolent deaths discovered on exhumation, and on judicial examination\r\nwhere marks of violence have been covered by the shroud, and where the\r\ncoffin has been closed on _primâ facie_ evidence of murder.\r\n\r\nBetween the every-day dangers arising from the undue retention of the\r\ndead amidst the living, and all real dangers and painful apprehensions,\r\na course of proceeding has been taken at Franckfort, and several cities\r\nin Germany, which has hitherto been perfectly successful as a sanitary\r\nmeasure, and highly satisfactory to the population.\r\n\r\n§ 95. A case is stated to have occurred at Franckfort, where, on taking\r\nto the grave a child which had died immediately after its mother, who\r\nhad been just interred, on opening her coffin the eye of the supposed\r\ncorpse moved, and she was taken out and recovered. She stated that she\r\nretained sensation, but had utterly lost all power of volition, even\r\nwhen the coffin was closed, and she heard the earth fall upon it.\r\n\r\n§ 96. This case, and some others which have undoubtedly occurred in\r\nGermany, led to the establishment of houses at Franckfort and Munich for\r\nthe reception and care of the dead until their interment; and similar\r\nestablishments have now been attached to a large proportion of the\r\nGerman cities, under regulations substantially the same. The State\r\nregulations of interments at Munich (translations of which, and of those\r\nat Franckfort, together with plans showing the construction of the\r\nhouses of reception, I have given in the Appendix) have this recital:—\r\n\r\n“Whereas it is of importance to all men to be perfectly assured that the\r\nbeings who were dear to them in life are not torn from them so long as\r\nany, the remotest, hope exists of preserving them,—so death itself\r\nbecomes less dreadful in its shape when one is convinced of its actual\r\noccurrence, and that a danger no longer exists of premature interment.\r\n\r\n“To afford this satisfaction to mankind, and to preclude the possibility\r\nof any one being treated as dead who is not actually so; to prevent the\r\nspread of infectious disorders as much as possible; to suppress the\r\nquackeries so highly injurious to the health of the people; to discover\r\nmurders committed by secret violence; and to deliver the perpetrators\r\nover to the hands of justice;—is the imperative duty of every wise\r\ngovernment; and in order to accomplish these objects, every one of which\r\nis of the greatest importance, recourse must be had to the safety, that\r\nis to say the medical police, as the most efficient means, by a strict\r\nmedical examination into the deaths occurring, and by a conformable\r\ninspection of the body.”\r\n\r\nThe regulations provide that, on the occurrence of the death, immediate\r\nnotice shall be given to the authorities, who shall cause the body to be\r\nremoved to the house of reception provided (which at Munich is a chapel\r\nwhere prayers are said) for its respectful care. At the edifice of the\r\ninstitution at Franckfort, an appropriate apparatus is provided for the\r\nrequisite ablutions with warm or tepid water: the body is received, if\r\nit be of a female, by properly appointed nurses, who perform, under\r\nsuperior medical superintendence, the requisite duties. The spirit of\r\nthe regulations of these institutions (vide Appendix) may be commended\r\nto attention; for if it be a high public duty, which is not questioned,\r\nto treat the remains of the dead with respect and reverence, it follows\r\nthat public means should be taken in every stage of proceeding, to\r\nprotect individuals against the violation of that duty; where private\r\nindividuals are, as they almost always are and must be, especially in\r\npopulous districts, compelled to call in the aid of strangers for the\r\nperformance of such ministrations as those of purifying and enshrouding\r\nthe corpse, such securities as are exemplified in these regulations\r\nshould be taken that those duties are confided to hands invested with\r\nresponsibilities, and having a character of respectability, if not of\r\nsanctity. At Munich, they are intrusted to a religious order of Nuns. At\r\nFranckfort a private room is appropriated for the reception of each\r\ncorpse, where regular warmth and due ventilation and light, night and\r\nday, are maintained. Here it may be visited by the relations or friends\r\nproperly entitled. On a finger of each corpse is placed a ring, attached\r\nto which is the end of a string of a bell,[25] which on the slightest\r\nmotion will give an alarm to one of the watchmen in nightly and daily\r\nattendance, by whom the resident physician will be called. Each body is\r\ndaily inspected by the responsible physician, by whom a certificate of\r\nunequivocal symptoms of death must be given before any interment is\r\nallowed to take place. The legislative provisions of the institution of\r\nthe house of reception at Franckfort are thus stated:—\r\n\r\n  The following are the regulations regarding the use of the house for\r\n  the reception and care of the dead, which are here made known for\r\n  every one’s observance.\r\n\r\n  (1.) The object of this institution is—\r\n\r\n    _a._ To give perfect security against the danger of premature\r\n    interment.\r\n\r\n    _b._ To offer a respectable place for the reception of the dead,\r\n    in order to remove the corpse from the confined dwellings of the\r\n    survivors.\r\n\r\n  (2.) The use of the reception-house is quite voluntary, yet, in case\r\n  the physician may consider it necessary for the safety of the\r\n  survivors that the dead be removed, a notification to this effect\r\n  must be forwarded to the Younger Burgermeister to obtain the\r\n  necessary order.\r\n\r\n  (3.) Even in case the house of reception is not used the dead cannot\r\n  be interred, until after the lapse of three nights, without the\r\n  proper certificate of the physician that the signs of decomposition\r\n  have commenced. In order to prevent the indecency which has formerly\r\n  occurred, of preparing too early the certificate of the death, the\r\n  physician shall in future sign a preliminary announcement of the\r\n  occurrence of death, for the sake of the previous arrangements\r\n  necessary for an interment, but the certificate of death is only to\r\n  be prepared when the corpse shows unequivocal signs of decomposition\r\n  having commenced. For the dead which it is wished to place in the\r\n  house of reception, the physician prepares a certificate of removal.\r\n  This certificate of removal can only be given after the lapse of the\r\n  different periods, of six hours; in sudden death, of twelve hours;\r\n  and in other cases, twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n§ 97. A German merchant, now resident in London, who took great interest\r\nin the institution, informs me that he visited it in company with his\r\nfriend, one of the inspecting physicians of this house of reception. His\r\nattention was there attracted by the corpse of a beautiful child:—that\r\nchild turned out not to be dead, and he himself saw it alive and\r\nrecovered. No such event is known to have occurred at Munich.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, and Mr. Koch, our consul at Franckfort, who obtained for\r\nthis Report the plans of the house of reception and the regulations for\r\ninterment in that city, both attest from extensive knowledge of its\r\npopulation, that the effect of this institution, of which all classes\r\navail themselves, is, on the part of the poorest and most susceptible\r\nclasses, to allay all feelings of reluctance to part with the remains,\r\nand to create, on the contrary, a general desire for their removal from\r\nthe private house early after death, that they may be placed under the\r\ncare of skilful and responsible officers. The aggravation and extension\r\nof disease to the living is thus prevented; the protraction of the pain\r\nof the weaker and more susceptible of the survivors, arising from the\r\nundue retention of the remains, and the demoralizing effect of\r\nfamiliarity with them on the parts of the younger, and those of the\r\nleast susceptible of the survivors, are equally avoided.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from an official report made for this\r\ninquiry through the English Ambassador, on the operation of similar\r\nregulations at Munich:—\r\n\r\n“The arrangements made for the speedy removal of the body after death\r\nare considered highly beneficial in a sanative point of view, as tending\r\nto check the spread of contagious and unclean disorders, more\r\nparticularly in the crowded parts of the town.\r\n\r\n“At the same time the great care and attention paid to the bodies in the\r\nplace where they are deposited, the precautions taken in cases of\r\nre-animation, and the ascertaining beyond a doubt the actual occurrence\r\nof death, are sufficiently satisfactory to the surviving relations.\r\n\r\n“The examinations also which take place immediately after death have\r\nbeen found equally useful in detecting the employment of violent or\r\nimproper means in causing death, as well as in discovering the existence\r\nof any contagious disease against which it is of importance to guard.\r\n\r\n“There is only one burial ground for the whole city of Munich, on a\r\nscale sufficiently large for the population, and open to Protestants as\r\nwell as Catholics, without distinction.”\r\n\r\n§ 98. The practical means for the accomplishment of such an alteration\r\nof custom in the mode of keeping the remains of the deceased,\r\npreparatory to interment, in the towns of England, may be further\r\nconsidered in connexion with the remedial measures, for the reduction of\r\nthe great and unnecessary expense of funerals.\r\n\r\nMr. Hewitt states the practical need of some such accommodation of\r\nsurvivors for the temporary reception of the dead in the crowded\r\ndistricts, independently of the high considerations on which the\r\nintermediate houses of reception at Franckfort and Munich and other\r\nparts of Germany were established.\r\n\r\n  The house in which my foreman lives is seldom unoccupied by a\r\n  corpse. During the last week there were three at one time. The poor\r\n  people speak of the inconvenience of having the corpse in their\r\n  house, where they have only one room for their family. It is\r\n  customary for me to say, “Very well, then, you may be accommodated;\r\n  the body may be brought to our house, and kept until the time of the\r\n  funeral, when you and your friends may come to the house and put on\r\n  your fittings and follow the body to the ground.” This is done: men\r\n  and women come to the house, put on hoods, scarves, coats, and\r\n  hatbands, and follow the body to the ground. The body is sometimes\r\n  removed under these circumstances from the room of the private house\r\n  where the death has taken place, but it is most frequently done when\r\n  the death of a poor person has occurred in an hospital, a workhouse,\r\n  or a prison, and it is wished to bury them respectably, but where it\r\n  would be inconvenient to remove them to the only room which the\r\n  family have to live in. I believe that all the undertakers receive\r\n  deceased persons in their houses and keep them for burial.\r\n\r\n  Judging from the particular instances coming within your own\r\n  experience, do you believe that if arrangements of a superior order\r\n  were made for the reception of bodies and keeping them under medical\r\n  care previous to interment, the accommodation would be deemed a\r\n  boon?—Yes; it would be a boon to a great many classes, especially\r\n  the poorest. It would be a great accommodation also to many persons\r\n  of the middle classes—shopkeepers, who only keep the under part of\r\n  their houses and let off the upper parts. On the occurrence of a\r\n  death these classes are as much inconvenienced by the presence of a\r\n  corpse as are persons of the labouring classes. And yet there are\r\n  few who like to have a burial take place in less time than a week.\r\n  To such persons as these it would certainly be a very great\r\n  accommodation to have an intermediate house of reception for the due\r\n  care of the body until the proper time of interment.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Tagg, jun., an undertaker of extensive business in the city\r\nof London, states, that “besides the poorest classes who die at\r\nhospitals and are buried by their friends, and are sometimes taken to\r\nthe undertaker’s premises, when more convenient to the relatives of the\r\ndeceased than to be removed to their own houses, that respectable\r\npersons also from the country, who die at an hotel or inn, or in\r\napartments, are occasionally removed to the undertaker’s until the\r\ncoffins are made, and they can be conveyed to the residence of their\r\nfamily, or their vaults in the country.”\r\n\r\n§ 99. Mr. Wild gives other examples of the practice; and states that\r\ninstances sometimes occur of persons of respectable condition in life\r\nwho cannot bear the painful impressions produced by the long continued\r\npresence of the corpse in the house, and who quit it, and return to\r\nattend the funeral.\r\n\r\n§ 100. Mr. P. H. Holland, surgeon and registrar of Chorlton-on-Medlock,\r\nin Manchester, states an instance where a mother who had lost two of her\r\nchildren from small-pox (as she conceived, from the retention in the\r\nhouse of the corpse of a child belonging to another woman which had also\r\ndied of the small-pox) stated that it would be a great boon to the\r\npoorer classes to provide proper places to receive bodies until the\r\nconvenient time of interment. The extent of benefit which such a\r\nprovision would confer, and which is attested by other witnesses of\r\nextensive experience, will indeed be sufficiently manifest on\r\nconsideration of the circumstances under which they are placed.\r\n\r\n§ 101. It is only submitted that suitable accommodation should be\r\nprovided for the removal and care of bodies, and given, as it would be,\r\nas a boon. Confident statements are frequently made that the removal of\r\nthe deceased from private houses to any public place of reception would\r\nbe resisted; but it appears on an examination of the cases in which\r\nresistance was made, that in most of them the arrangements were really\r\noffensive, coarse-minded, and vulgar, and such as to prove that the\r\nfeelings of the relations and survivors were little cared for by those\r\nwho ought to have understood and consulted them. In some cases of the\r\nlowest paupers the retention of the body has been proved to have arisen\r\nfrom a desire to raise money, on the pretext of applying it to defray\r\nthe expenses of the funeral long after it had been provided for; but the\r\nobjection of the respectable portions of the labouring classes are\r\nobjections not to the removal itself, but to the mode and sort of place\r\nin which it is commonly performed on the occurrence of a death from\r\ncontagious disease, in a bare parish shell, by pauper bearers, to the\r\n“bone-house” or other customary receptacle for suicides, deserted or\r\nrelationless, or, as they are sometimes termed, “God-forsaken people.”\r\nOn the occurrence of the cholera little difficulty was interposed by any\r\nclass to the immediate removal of the dead. The success of such a\r\nmeasure would depend entirely on the mode in which it is conducted.\r\n\r\n§ 102. In reference to all such alterations, it may here be premised\r\nthat very serious practical errors are frequently created by taking\r\nparticular manifestations of feeling or prejudice, and assuming those\r\nprejudices to be impregnable, and assuming, moreover, that any or every\r\nprejudice pervades the entire population.\r\n\r\nNot only does the extent of the prejudices which are supposed to stand\r\nin the way of regulations of the practice of interments, but the\r\ndifficulties of overcoming them, appear, from an examination of the\r\nevidence, to be commonly much exaggerated; but it appears that the\r\nnature of the objections themselves is much mistaken: it appears, for\r\nexample, that the prejudice against dissection often arises less from a\r\ndesire to preserve the remains in their living form than to preserve\r\nthem from profanation and disrespect. In no part of the country has a\r\nmore intense feeling been manifested to preserve the remains of the dead\r\nfrom dissection than in Scotland, where the expense of safes made of\r\niron bars, strongly riveted down, and of a watchman to watch it, forms a\r\nprominent item of the funeral charges. Yet when the studies of the\r\nschools of anatomy were allowed to depend chiefly on the supplies of\r\nsubjects stolen from the graves, it is stated by practitioners who,\r\nwhilst students, were themselves driven to that mode of procuring\r\nsubjects, that their labours were frequently frustrated by the\r\nprecautions the survivors had taken to render the use of the remains for\r\ndissection impossible, by putting quick lime into the coffin to destroy\r\nthem. The same precaution has been known to have been sometimes taken\r\nfor the same purpose in London; and yet by proper care and attention to\r\nthe feelings of the survivors, the practice of post-mortem examinations\r\nhas been extended, and the consent to the use of the remains even for\r\ndissection in the schools has been frequently obtained from the\r\nsurvivors. A witness of peculiar and extensive opportunities of\r\nexperience in several thousand cases was asked on this point—\r\n\r\n  Have you had any reason to believe, that by careful and kind\r\n  treatment of the labouring classes, their prejudices may be\r\n  extensively overcome?—Yes, certainly. There was no prejudice\r\n  stronger or more general than that to post-mortem examinations, or\r\n  to any dissection; yet by care, and by the inducement of the\r\n  allowance of a better funeral, that prejudice has been extensively\r\n  overcome. The teachers of the medical schools, after dissection of a\r\n  body, and its use for the advancement of medical knowledge, have\r\n  made a liberal allowance for the interment of the remains; such sums\r\n  as three or four pounds have been allowed for that service. When the\r\n  relations of the poorest classes have expressed the common aversion\r\n  to a pauper funeral, and their pain at having to submit to it on\r\n  account of their necessity, I have told them if they would allow the\r\n  remains to be taken to a medical school, and be examined, the\r\n  teachers would allow them such a respectable funeral as they wish; I\r\n  have sometimes added, “It is for the advancement of science; persons\r\n  of the highest rank and condition in society have directed their\r\n  remains to be examined, and I do not see what sound objection there\r\n  can be to any of the poorest classes doing so.” Whenever I have made\r\n  the offer under such circumstances it has generally been accepted.\r\n\r\n  Of course after the examination at the schools, the remains were\r\n  properly and respectfully interred?—Yes they were, wherever the\r\n  parties requested, whether in or out of the parish.—They frequently\r\n  chose places of interment out of the parish, and in some instances\r\n  places two or three miles distant, and almost always out of the\r\n  town.\r\n\r\n  Why was the burial mostly chosen out of the parish?—Generally from a\r\n  dislike to the places and mode in which paupers were buried; to\r\n  their being put into a hole, where, perhaps, fifty others were,\r\n  instead of having a separate grave. They frequently made it a main\r\n  condition, that the remains should be buried out of the parish.\r\n\r\nThe means to ensure voluntary compliance with all salutary regulations\r\nfor the better ordering of interments, are those which ensure real\r\nrespect to the remains of the interred, and thus to the feelings of the\r\nsurvivors. The widows’ and the mothers’ feelings of reluctance to part\r\nwith the corpse would, from such measures, receive appropriate\r\nalleviation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Proposed Remedies by means of separate Parochial Establishments in\r\n                          Suburban Districts._\r\n\r\n§ 103. A set of remedies, as proposed in the Committee of the House of\r\nCommons, and agreed to, has been before the public, and the chief part\r\nof them embodied in a bill proposed to the House at the close of the\r\nSession of Parliament of 1842. All the evidence of disinterested persons\r\nwhich I have met with, all paid and experienced officers connected with\r\nparishes, whose interests would perhaps be the least disturbed by\r\nparochial establishments, concur in the conclusion that the measures\r\nproposed for creating such establishments would not diminish, but would\r\nrather diffuse, and might even aggravate the evils intended to be\r\nremedied.\r\n\r\nBy the first clause it was proposed to enact—\r\n\r\n  That the rector, vicar, or incumbent, and the church-wardens of\r\n  every parish, township, or place in every such city, town, borough,\r\n  or place respectively, shall form a parochial committee of health\r\n  for every such parish, township, or place.\r\n\r\n§ 104. The first observation which occurs on this proposal is, that it\r\ninvolves the formation of “a committee of health,” for the execution of\r\na sanitary measure, requiring the application of a very high degree of\r\nthe science applicable to the protection of the public health, and omits\r\nall provision of services of the nature of those which would be required\r\nfrom a well-qualified medical officer. A provision on a parochial scale\r\nwould indeed preclude the regular application of such service, except at\r\na disproportionate expense. As a remedy against undue charges on the\r\nsmaller parishes, a power of forming unions for the purpose is provided\r\nby the clause.\r\n\r\n  Or it shall be lawful for the rectors, vicars, or incumbents and\r\n  church-wardens of any two or more parishes, townships, or places\r\n  therein, to form such parishes, townships, or places into a Union\r\n  for the purposes of this Act; and in such cases the rectors, vicars,\r\n  or incumbents, and church-wardens of each parish, township, or place\r\n  so united, shall form a parochial committee of health for such\r\n  Union; and all the powers hereinafter given to any such committee\r\n  may be executed by the majority of the members of any such committee\r\n  at any meeting.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed by the most experienced public officers, that even a\r\ncompulsory power to form unions of two parishes, but leaving the union\r\nbeyond that number optional, would be equivalent to a provision, that\r\ntwo and _no_ more shall unite; but that a merely permissive power to\r\nunite would be nugatory, except perhaps in the case of the smallest\r\nparishes: in other words, since there are in the district to which the\r\nenactment would apply, in the metropolis, upwards of 170 parishes, it\r\nwould imply the establishment of upwards of 100 places of burial in such\r\nplaces as the following clauses would enable the parishes to provide.\r\n\r\n  And be it enacted, that every such committee may provide a\r\n  convenient site of land for the burial of the dead of the district\r\n  for which such committee shall be formed, which land shall not be in\r\n  or within the distance of two miles from the precincts or boundaries\r\n  of the city of London or Westminster, or the borough of Southwark,\r\n  or in or within one mile of any other city, town, borough, or place;\r\n  and no land which shall be purchased for such purpose shall be\r\n  within 300 yards of any house of the annual value of 50_l._, or\r\n  having a plantation or ornamental garden or pleasure-ground occupied\r\n  therewith (except with the consent in writing of the owner, lessee,\r\n  and occupier of such house).\r\n\r\nAn undertaker who has an extensive business, states that he has for some\r\ntime been desirous of purchasing a piece of ground for interments in the\r\nsuburbs of the metropolis, as a private speculation of his own, and that\r\nhe had been three years in looking out for a plot that was suitable and\r\npurchasable, but has hitherto been unable to procure one. Other\r\nwitnesses, on similar grounds, doubt the practicability of parishes\r\nprocuring land, unless at enormous prices.\r\n\r\nSupposing it were possible to procure separate plots for all the\r\nparishes which will require them in the suburbs, there are preliminary\r\nobjections to the plan which relate to the suburbs themselves.\r\n\r\n§ 105. The suburbs, it may be submitted, not only require careful\r\nprotection on their own account, but on account of the population of the\r\ncrowded districts of the metropolis, which are relieved by the growth of\r\nthe suburbs. The progress of the new increments to towns is, therefore,\r\nas a sanitary measure, entitled to favourable protection. But the\r\nappropriation of vacant places, without reference to any general plan,\r\nmust create very frequent impediments to the regular or systematic\r\ngrowth of the suburbs, and can scarcely fail ultimately to deteriorate\r\nthem. And by the proposed measure the place of interments being removed,\r\nnot only without any securities for the adoption of new measures of\r\nprecaution, such as will be shown to be requisite in the formation, and\r\nalso in the management, of places of burial for a large population, and\r\nthe proposed machinery being such as to render it very nearly certain\r\nthat no improved arrangements can be executed in such burial-grounds,\r\nthe measure would simply effect the transference of common grave-yards\r\nfrom the old to the midst of new suburbs; and this transference must be\r\naccompanied by the creation of a new and apparently economical, but\r\nreally extravagantly expensive and permanently inferior, agency, for the\r\nmanagement of the new ground.\r\n\r\n§ 106. These results admit of proof derived from the actual trial of a\r\nsystem of parochial interments apparently differing in no essential\r\npoint, and especially in the nature of the agency and the scale of\r\nestablishments, from the plan proposed.\r\n\r\nIn the parishes of St. Giles-in-the-Fields, St. George, Hanover-square,\r\nSt. James, Westminster, and St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, over-crowding of\r\nthe burial grounds within the parish, between forty and fifty years ago,\r\nled the parish officers to obtain local acts for the establishment of\r\nburial grounds in the suburbs. The spaces then obtained were apart from\r\nany buildings. They are all now closely surrounded by them. The burial\r\ngrounds of the parish of St. Giles-in-the-Fields having been the subject\r\nof an investigation before the Committee of the House of Commons, I have\r\nnot made any inquiries with relation to them. In the suburban burial\r\nground which belongs to the parish of St. George, Hanover-square, which\r\nconsists of two acres of land, the interments have been for many years\r\nat the rate of about 1000 corpses per annum. It is now in the centre of\r\na dense town population. It has become the subject of complaints similar\r\nto those made in respect to burial grounds in the ancient parts of the\r\nmetropolis; and it appears that there are equally good grounds for the\r\ndiscontinuance of the practice of interment there, and for the selection\r\nof a burial place at a greater distance, notwithstanding that the\r\npayments from individuals produce to the collective funds of that parish\r\na surplus beyond the expenditure of the management of the ground.\r\n\r\n§ 107. The arrangements for burial in the parishes of St.\r\nMartin-in-the-Fields, which has a population of 25,000, and of St.\r\nJames, Westminster, which has a population of 37,000, where the suburban\r\nburial grounds have not been crowded to the same extent, may be adduced\r\nas a high class of examples of a change of practice to extra-mural or\r\nsuburban burials, and of management by a parochial machinery. In the\r\nparish of St. James, Westminster—\r\n\r\n  The gross expenditure of the chapel and ground between the years\r\n  1789 and 1835 (46 years) amounted to £73,879 1_s._ 11_d._, and it is\r\n  estimated that the cost of maintaining the chapel and ground during\r\n  that period over and above the receipts was not less than £50,000,\r\n  the whole of which was drawn from the churchwardens under authority\r\n  of the Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\nBut the chapel attached to the burial ground of this parish has been\r\nconverted into a chapel of ease, for the accommodation of the\r\ninhabitants of the parish where it is situate. The vestry clerk of the\r\nparish states—\r\n\r\n  The pew rents, which formerly averaged only £150, now amount to\r\n  upwards of £500 per annum, while the burial fees have decreased, and\r\n  are still decreasing in amount.\r\n\r\n  The interments of the middle class and more wealthy among the\r\n  inhabitants of the parish of St. James, which do not take place\r\n  either in the vaults or grounds of or belonging to the parish, are\r\n  presumed to be made in the neighbouring cemeteries, while the\r\n  labouring class resort chiefly, as I am informed, to the burial\r\n  ground in Spa Fields, where the fees are less by 2_s._ 9_d._ than at\r\n  the Hampstead Road ground, the undertaker’s charges being the same\r\n  for each.\r\n\r\n  Is the church to be considered part of the burial ground?—Yes; it\r\n  is. The Act apparently contemplated only a place for the performance\r\n  of a service over the dead, not for services to regular\r\n  congregations. The minister has a house on the ground, and derives a\r\n  portion of his emoluments from pew rents, derived from persons who\r\n  attend the chapel from the immediate neighbourhood—parishioners of\r\n  St. Pancras parish; very few, if any, of the parishioners of St.\r\n  James, have pews there. The minister, Dr. Stebbing, has a moiety of\r\n  the pew rents, which now amount to nearly £500 per annum. His\r\n  proportion of the burial fees may be about £70 per annum.\r\n\r\n  Since the commencement, has the income defrayed the expenses of the\r\n  burial ground?—Since Dr. Stebbing has been the minister it has only\r\n  just paid the expenses; but I am apprehensive that it will not\r\n  continue to do so. By the Act for the regulation of the chapel, any\r\n  deficiency in the expenditure is directed to be made good out of the\r\n  moneys in the churchwardens’ hands. Since the establishment of the\r\n  chapel it has been a drag on the funds: a very severe one.\r\n\r\n  When the chapel was established were there any houses round it?—Not\r\n  any.\r\n\r\n  What is its condition in that respect now?—It is now in the midst of\r\n  houses which are increasing in numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen asked, what was the condition of the burial ground, notwithstanding\r\nthe expenditure made upon it, he states that—\r\n\r\n  The ground, consisting of four acres, is in a very watery condition,\r\n  but is considered capable of being effectually drained, the expense\r\n  being the only obstacle.\r\n\r\n  Is it considered that the ground will hold more than it does?—Many\r\n  more; and a much larger amount of burials for a number of years.\r\n\r\n  What are the objections to the ground?—One objection among the\r\n  higher classes, and a very serious one, is that it is very wet.\r\n  After a grave has been dug, the water in it has risen, and the\r\n  coffin is lowered into the water.\r\n\r\n  Has there been any expenditure upon it for rendering it attractive\r\n  by planting or ornamenting it?—In former years it was planted with\r\n  trees or shrubs; but as compared with the cemeteries it cannot\r\n  pretend to any attractions.\r\n\r\n  Is there anything in the circumstances of the establishment of the\r\n  burial ground and chapel for St. James which do not render it a fair\r\n  example of any similar measure for an equivalent population in these\r\n  times?—There appear to be no circumstances to prevent it being\r\n  considered a fair example.\r\n\r\n§ 108. The following is the account of the St. Martin’s suburban burial\r\nground, given by Mr. Le Breton, the clerk to the guardians of the\r\nparish:—\r\n\r\n  What is the provision made for the burial of the poorer classes in\r\n  the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields?—The burial ground in\r\n  Drury-lane in 1804 was considered to be full, when four acres of\r\n  ground, situate at Camden-town, were purchased and used as a\r\n  cemetery. The plot was then in what was considered the country: the\r\n  distance of the spot is rather more than two miles from the\r\n  workhouse. Since its institution it has been completely surrounded\r\n  by houses, and they are now building close against the wall of the\r\n  burial ground. Originally it was designed as a better sort of burial\r\n  ground, but since loss has been incurred by it and it has not been\r\n  found to be attractive; two hundred pounds have recently been\r\n  expended upon it in planting it. Formerly it was so wet that when\r\n  persons went to funerals there they often found that the coffin was\r\n  let down several feet in water or mire. This created an unpleasant\r\n  sensation, and the ground was drained at a great expense into the\r\n  Fleet-ditch. The objection as to the wetness of the ground does not\r\n  now exist.\r\n\r\n  What have been the expenses, and the numbers of interments and\r\n  charges of the burial ground?—(The following statement was given in\r\n  answer to this question.)\r\n\r\n The original cost of forming ground, &c., was about              £2,000\r\n The price is a perpetual rent-charge of, for the 4 acres, £100 = £3,000\r\n   per annum\r\n Establishment Charges:—\r\n             Chaplain’s salary per annum                             £60\r\n             Sexton’s salary per annum                               £50\r\n             Keeping up ground by gardener                           £20\r\n             Paving rate per annum                                   £30\r\n             Compensation to St. Pancras                              £5\r\n The chaplain and sexton have houses to dwell in, which\r\n   are kept in repair, insured, and the taxes paid by the            £30\r\n   parish at a considerable expense\r\n\r\n  A private Act of Parliament was obtained, but at what cost does not\r\n  appear.\r\n\r\n  The burial ground was formed in 1804, and the charges of it to this\r\n  date have exceeded £10,000 beyond the fees received.\r\n\r\n            _From 20th March, 1806, to 1st December, 1842._\r\n\r\n Total number of burials at Camden-town since the formation of   10,982\r\n   the ground\r\n      Of these were non-parishioners                              1,987\r\n      Of these were paupers                                       4,624\r\n      Of these were buried in the cheapest ground where           1,062\r\n        monuments are not allowed\r\n All burials for St. Martin in the Fields, 1841                     522\r\n Registered deaths, 1841                                            589\r\n\r\n  Beyond the expense of the establishment, have any inconveniences\r\n  been the subject of complaint by the parishioners?—Yes; that the\r\n  hours appointed by the chaplain are not those most suited for\r\n  interments; that they are often driven off until late in the\r\n  evening, and in consequence of the time being limited the service is\r\n  performed in a hurried manner. In respect to position, the cemetery\r\n  appears to be convenient, and no one within the district complains\r\n  of any offence arising from it. My own view is that there ought to\r\n  be a central or some other supervision over cemeteries: if there be\r\n  not there will only be abuses and grounds of dissatisfaction.\r\n\r\n  Do you conceive that the experience of the parish of St. Martin, of\r\n  a separate parochial cemetery, is applicable as an index to the\r\n  general charge upon the rate-payers in the other parishes of the\r\n  metropolis, resulting from the simple prohibition of interments in\r\n  the town, and the permission to any two or more parishes to provide\r\n  cemeteries for; in other words, to the transference of burial\r\n  grounds from the centre of the town to the midst of the\r\n  suburbs?—Yes, I do consider it applicable: moreover, that at the\r\n  present time, it would be still more difficult to obtain sites\r\n  within a reasonable distance than it was in 1804: the expenses of\r\n  separate parochial grounds must therefore be much more considerable.\r\n\r\n§ 109. The Rev. Wm. Stone, the rector of Spitalfields, whose position,\r\nas the minister of a large and populous parish, possessing one of the\r\nbest managed places of burial in the metropolis, gives him peculiar\r\nopportunities of judging of the most advantageous administrative\r\narrangements, and entitles his observations to peculiar weight,\r\nconcludes his testimony in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n  1. As the clergyman of a poor and populous parish, I should regret\r\n  the necessity of imposing any additional rate upon my parishioners,\r\n  especially any one which was likely to be regarded as a church rate;\r\n  and I feel certain, that a rate assessed for the burial of the dead,\r\n  and collected under the authority of the rector and churchwardens,\r\n  would be so regarded. Under our present system, the burial of the\r\n  dead is a source of profit; it yields an annual surplus towards\r\n  defraying the other expenses of the church; and it thus conspires\r\n  with other circumstances to make the church-rate fall light upon my\r\n  parishioners. But in a population like mine any additional impost\r\n  would be felt; and confounded, as in such a population it certainly\r\n  would be, with church-rate, it might operate mischievously or even\r\n  fatally against the church establishment of my parish. The same\r\n  objection would apply in principle to all poor and populous\r\n  parishes. As a clergyman, too, I might add more personal\r\n  considerations; for, though the incumbent, as the only permanent\r\n  member of the committee of health, might have some local prominence\r\n  and weight, more, perhaps, than might everywhere be satisfactory to\r\n  dissenters; yet, in imposing pecuniary charges on his parishioners,\r\n  and levying penalties for the non-payment of those charges, he would\r\n  have duties unpopular enough to outweigh the advantage of any\r\n  distinction conferred on him.\r\n\r\n  2. If it is said, that a rate of 1_d._ in the pound would be too\r\n  light to be felt; it may be said also that it would be too much so\r\n  to answer its purpose. It is commonly calculated, that, in my\r\n  parish, a rate of 6_d._ in the pound realizes barely 500_l._, yet\r\n  the population to be provided with interment is above 20,000. And as\r\n  all the parishes about us are in much the same circumstances this\r\n  objection would apply equally to a union of parishes.\r\n\r\n  3. There is much that is objectionable in the proposed local\r\n  committees of health.\r\n\r\n  A local board would be less likely to possess the confidence of the\r\n  people. Indeed, it would be exposed to the influence of personal\r\n  interest and local partialities; and still more so, if the majority\r\n  of its members were in office for a year or two only. A board of\r\n  this kind may be said to exist already in my own parish, where a\r\n  local Act of Parliament places the burial ground in the hands of the\r\n  parish officers. And it is but a few years since my attention was\r\n  forcibly called to the insecurity of this local arrangement by one\r\n  of my parishioners. This parishioner, who was intimately and\r\n  practically acquainted with the working of our parochial system,\r\n  represented to me the necessity of adopting increased precautions\r\n  for the protection of our burial ground, “for,” said he, “a partial\r\n  or interested parish officer might do almost anything he pleased\r\n  with it;” and he proceeded to name an individual, who had even\r\n  intimated his intention to do so as soon as he should come into\r\n  office. There can be no doubt, indeed, that any individual might do\r\n  so. It is impossible to say, to what extent a tradesman so disposed\r\n  might oblige his friends and customers, and benefit himself; for as\r\n  senior officer of the year he would have the sole disposal of the\r\n  burial ground, and receive all payments for burials, private graves,\r\n  vaults, and the erection of monumental tablets, without any demand\r\n  upon those receipts, but a limited sum payable to the rector, and\r\n  without any inspective control over them but that of a board of\r\n  auditors chosen from his brother vestrymen. From my own observation,\r\n  I do not think that parish auditors are generally very accurate in\r\n  their investigations. But on a subject like the one in question,\r\n  they hardly could be so. Even supposing what is seldom, if ever, the\r\n  case, that they had a practical knowledge of the subject, and\r\n  conducted their investigations with the authorized table of fees\r\n  before them, they might in many instances be eluded. During the\r\n  first four years of my incumbency, the parish officers reported\r\n  their receipts for burials at the average amount of 215_l._ a-year,\r\n  which sum, after the deduction of 125_l._ secured to the rector,\r\n  left an annual surplus of 90_l._ At that time it was generally held\r\n  to be a point of official honour, that the amount of this surplus\r\n  should be kept secret out of doors. It was kept secret even from the\r\n  rector; and it may serve at once to show the impolicy of secrecy,\r\n  and the extent to which local authorities are distrusted, that my\r\n  predecessor always had his misgivings on the subject. Though\r\n  remarkable for the mildness and amiability of his disposition, he\r\n  could never surmise any more innocent misapplication of this\r\n  surplus, than that it was alienated from the church for the relief\r\n  of the poor rate.\r\n\r\n  A constant change in the majority of a local board would be most\r\n  unfavourable to uniformity of system, efficiency, and economy. Upon\r\n  this ground I believe the church to be a great loser by the office\r\n  of churchwarden. An individual charged with raising and expending\r\n  the ecclesiastical finances of a parish for a year only is little\r\n  likely to perform those duties as well as if he had a more permanent\r\n  authority. To say nothing of his having more temptation to\r\n  indolence, and to an ostentatious or interested profusion, he\r\n  labours under the unavoidable disadvantage of inexperience. By the\r\n  time that he becomes efficient in his office, he is called upon to\r\n  retire from it.\r\n\r\n  A local board would want many other advantages of a more publicly\r\n  constituted authority. Supplied with members by the casualties of\r\n  parochial office, it could not always command a high order of\r\n  intelligence. It would necessarily be limited in its opportunities\r\n  of observation; and, as it could not make its purchases and regulate\r\n  its current expenditure to the same advantage as if it acted on a\r\n  more extensive scale, it would, of course, prove less economical to\r\n  the public.\r\n\r\n  In fact, from all my local observation, I am led to hope that, in\r\n  removing the interment of the dead from populous towns, the\r\n  Legislature will adopt not a parochial but a comprehensive national\r\n  plan for the purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Drew, the vestry clerk and superintendent registrar of Bermondsey,\r\nmakes similar objections to the proposed machinery; that “the persons\r\nnominated to carry out such a measure in parishes would not be\r\nsatisfactory to the inhabitants, even if they were disposed to act.”\r\n\r\nMr. Corder, the clerk to the Strand Union, was asked upon this subject—\r\n\r\n  What do you believe to be the prevailing opinion in your Union on\r\n  the subject of town interments?—I believe there is a strong and\r\n  growing opinion against the practice of interring in London and its\r\n  immediate environs. I believe that public feeling generally is\r\n  opposed to that custom, as being prejudicial to health, and often\r\n  more distressing to the feelings of the survivors than interments\r\n  would be in a more distant and less familiar and frequented spot.\r\n\r\n  Do you think the parishioners of London parishes would approve of\r\n  separate and distinct parochial cemeteries?—No, I think they would\r\n  prefer having one or more cemeteries on a very extensive scale to\r\n  having parochial cemeteries which, in the neighbourhood of the\r\n  metropolis, would, I think, be found almost impracticable.\r\n\r\n  Do you think that parishes generally would object to the expense of\r\n  providing cemeteries?—I think that if separate parochial cemeteries\r\n  were established, the expense incurred would be so serious as to\r\n  induce parishes almost to submit to the evils resulting from town\r\n  interments rather than incur so heavy an expenditure. One of the\r\n  advantages of having one or more cemeteries on a large scale would\r\n  be that the expense would be thereby proportionably and very\r\n  considerably diminished.\r\n\r\nGeorge Downing, a mechanic, and secretary to a burial society, it will\r\nbe found, represents sentiments extensively prevalent amongst persons of\r\nhis own class in the metropolis.\r\n\r\n  Do you conceive that any arrangements for the improvement of\r\n  interments would be carried on more acceptably to the labouring\r\n  classes if they were conducted by officers connected with the\r\n  parish, or by a larger and superior agency?—The working people would\r\n  sell their beds from under them sooner than have any parish\r\n  funerals: it is heart-rending to them, and they would prefer any\r\n  other officers to the parish officers.\r\n\r\n  Do you find that they are prepared to have interments in the towns\r\n  prohibited?—Yes, it has been very much debated upon since the scenes\r\n  in the churchyards are made known, and they wish the bill to be\r\n  carried. I am confident that every man in our club would petition to\r\n  have the bill carried, so that such scenes may be put a stop to. I\r\n  find the opinion of the working men on the subject is quite\r\n  universal about it. They expect that Government will provide the\r\n  grounds and some means of conveyance.\r\n\r\nMr. Dix was asked—\r\n\r\n  Is it the expectation of the labouring and poorer classes that large\r\n  public cemeteries will be provided?—Yes, that I think is the general\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\n  Do you conceive that large cemeteries, on a national scale, will be\r\n  more acceptable to the labouring classes than parochial burial\r\n  grounds, whether in the present grounds or in burial grounds in the\r\n  suburbs of the metropolis?—I think the national cemeteries will be\r\n  much more popular.\r\n\r\n  If the burials of the working population could be performed in the\r\n  more ornamented and attractive cemeteries, such as those at Highgate\r\n  and Kensal Green, at the same expense as in any of the grounds\r\n  within the town, would there be any who would not be buried there?—I\r\n  think very few.\r\n\r\nUnequivocal proof is given of the dispositions of the labouring classes\r\nin this respect by the fact that the number of interments of persons of\r\nthose classes in cemeteries is increasing, even under increased charges.\r\nFor example, on examining the mortuary registries of the Westminster\r\ncemetery, to see what were the class of persons interred, it appeared\r\nthat the majority of the persons interred in that, which is the cemetery\r\nmost heavily charged with burial fees, was of the labouring classes from\r\nSt. George’s, Hanover-square. The fees for interment, in the suburban\r\nburial ground in the Bayswater-road, belonging to their own parish, were\r\n15_s._; and interments in the trading burial grounds might have been\r\nobtained at lower rates: but the fees paid for interment at the more\r\ndistant cemetery are 30_s._ for each burial. The registries contained\r\nsimilar evidence in an increasing number of interments of the labouring\r\nclasses from immediately adjacent suburban parishes, such as Chelsea,\r\nBrompton, and Kensington, of a disposition to make sacrifices, to obtain\r\ninterments in places that are more free from offensive associations to\r\nthem than those which attach to the parochial burial grounds.\r\n\r\nMr. Wild was asked—\r\n\r\n  So far as your experience goes, does the practice of interment in\r\n  cemeteries result from motives of economy or from choice of\r\n  situation?—From choice of situation, or from dislike of the\r\n  parochial burial-grounds; in nine cases out of ten from preference\r\n  of the situation and mode of interment in cemeteries; the choice\r\n  would indeed be general, if it were not for the increased charges\r\n  made by undertakers. The undertakers have generally increased the\r\n  funeral charges at the cemeteries above one-third. The number of men\r\n  taken out, whose whole day is occupied, make up the increased\r\n  charge.\r\n\r\n  You state, that but for the increased charge, the custom of\r\n  interment in cemeteries would be general; has the strength of the\r\n  attachments to the parochial churchyards diminished?—Yes, under the\r\n  recent inquiries and exposures of the state of the churchyards they\r\n  have almost vanished. But at no time was the attachment to the\r\n  parochial churchyards in town so strong as in the country. In the\r\n  country, even the poorer classes will pay the sexton a fee of from\r\n  1_s._ 6_d._ to 2_s._ 6_d._, for “keeping up the grave.” This cannot\r\n  be the case in the towns for want of space; parties who appoint\r\n  their places of burial, generally select a place on account of its\r\n  quiet.\r\n\r\n  Do you believe that the wish to be buried where kindred are buried,\r\n  is, or would continue to be stronger, than a desire to be buried in\r\n  well-provided cemeteries?—No; this is shewn by the increasing\r\n  frequency with which parties who have family vaults, desire to be\r\n  buried in the cemeteries. Very recently I performed the funeral of a\r\n  lady belonging to a family who had a vault in a church at\r\n  Westminster—her husband had been buried in it. By her will she\r\n  desired to be buried at Kensal Green, and she had requested that if\r\n  the churchyard at Westminster was closed, her husband’s remains\r\n  might be brought and placed next to hers in the cemetery. There were\r\n  other members of the family besides her husband buried in the family\r\n  vault. Such instances are now becoming very frequent.\r\n\r\n  Inasmuch as interments in cemeteries have generally increased the\r\n  charges of interment, is it not to be apprehended that unless some\r\n  regulations on a larger scale than of small localities be adopted,\r\n  the inconvenience arising in towns will increase the charges of\r\n  these calamities to the poorest of the middle classes and to the\r\n  working classes, not to speak of the charges on the poor’s rates,\r\n  for the interments of paupers will also be increased by\r\n  districts?—Yes; it has occurred to me that it will be so.\r\n\r\nHe expresses his conviction, however, that so strong is the feeling at\r\npresent against parochial interments, that if there should be no\r\nlegislative provision or interference for the public protection, the\r\nparochial burial places being left open to the competition of private\r\nand trading burial grounds, in a very short time not one-third of the\r\npresent number of burials would take place in the parochial grounds.\r\n\r\n§ 110. The expense to the rate-payers of parishes for the transference\r\nof the interments to the suburbs would be necessarily very high; the\r\nexpense of numerous separate parochial establishments, if only on the\r\nscale of the establishments for the performance of the funeral ceremony,\r\nand for such imperfect care of the ground as that given in those\r\ndescribed would be, at the least, between 25 and 30,000_l._ per annum.\r\nThe proposed regulation of the distance of cemeteries from human\r\nhabitations—that they shall in every case be two miles, not from houses,\r\nbut from the metes and bounds of London and Westminster, and “of any\r\nother city, town, or borough,” as defined by the Municipal Act, and\r\n“which shall contain more than 500 houses, the occupiers of which shall\r\nbe rated to the relief of the poor more than 10_l._ or upwards,” appear\r\nto be made without any local examination, or reference to proper\r\nobservations or experience.—Vide post, §§ 162, 163, and 164. The metes\r\nand bounds of several towns and places include common lands and sites,\r\nsufficiently distant from any collections of houses, to be the most\r\neligible sites, and suitable soils for cemeteries, which according to\r\nthe best ascertained rule, should be at distances proportioned to the\r\nnumbers of inhabitants and probable burials, varying according to these\r\nnumbers, from 150 to 500 paces. All unnecessary increase of distance\r\nmust be attended with proportionately increased charges of interment to\r\nthe poorer classes: arrangements for preventing an increase of the\r\nexpense of conveyance of the remains to distant places of interment,\r\nthough practicable under general regulations for large national\r\ncemeteries, would be impracticable on the plan of numerous places of\r\ninterment with small separate establishments. Mr. Jeffryes, an\r\nundertaker, who chiefly inters the poorest classes in the Whitechapel\r\ndistrict, where the _parochial_ interments are generally diminishing,\r\nwas more particularly questioned on this topic.\r\n\r\n  What has been your experience in respect to the interment of people\r\n  of the working classes at cemeteries, and at a distance from their\r\n  residence, as compared with burials near their residence? At what\r\n  cemeteries have you interred persons?—At Mr. Barber Beaumont’s\r\n  cemetery, which is about a mile and a half from Whitechapel; and\r\n  also at the cemetery which is at the Cambridge Heath, Cambridge\r\n  Road. I have attended, but not on my own account, funerals at all\r\n  the other cemeteries—Highgate, Kensal Green, and others.\r\n\r\n  Supposing that interments within towns be prohibited for all\r\n  classes, and that funerals for the future must be performed beyond\r\n  the gas lamps or the pavements; judging from the cases you have\r\n  already had, what must be the effect on the funerals of the\r\n  labouring classes;—supposing that no other arrangements are made\r\n  than that of allowing parishes, or any two of them, to provide\r\n  cemeteries at a distance from town?—It will certainly increase the\r\n  expenses to the labouring classes, and increase the expenses to the\r\n  parishes generally. I perform funerals for the working classes at\r\n  one-third less than most others; yet I find that the extra expense\r\n  of a funeral only a mile or a mile and a quarter distance, is about\r\n  one pound per funeral extra; this consists chiefly of the extra\r\n  expense of conveyance.\r\n\r\n  Have you seen carriage conveyances or hearses for the conveyance of\r\n  bodies to the cemeteries without the use of bearers?—Yes, I have:\r\n  but to get a coffin out of the house, which sometimes has to be got\r\n  down stairs, and is very heavy, four men at the least will be\r\n  required, and then four men will be required to take it from the\r\n  hearse at the cemetery, so that men’s labour cannot be much less,\r\n  even if they provide bearers at the cemeteries, which is talked of:\r\n  there will still be the extra expense of the carriage, whatever that\r\n  is.\r\n\r\n§ 111. From the practical evidence already cited, §§ 87, 88, it will be\r\nperceived, that notwithstanding this increase of expense, the chaplain\r\nor curate, if unaided, cannot be expected to perform the service in a\r\nmanner that will be more satisfactory to the survivors than in those\r\nparochial grounds which are now the subject of complaint. The numerous\r\nsuccessive services that may be expected to arrive on the Sunday must\r\noften unavoidably have the appearance of being hurried over, and without\r\nassistance and appropriate superintendence will sometimes really be so,\r\nwhilst the funeral of the person of better condition which takes place\r\nseparately, and at an appointed time, has its separate attention under\r\ncircumstances, giving rise to the appearance and creating the feeling of\r\nan undue “acceptation of persons,” which it is said ought not to be, and\r\nwhich the examination of practical examples will show, need not be.\r\nInasmuch as, in the present mode, the clergyman’s attention must be\r\nabsorbed with his own clerical duties, the grave-yard and the material\r\noffices connected with it must be left to be managed, as it is now, by a\r\nsexton and common gravedigger. No multiplication of the numbers of such\r\npoor men in numerous extra-mural and parochial establishments will give\r\nthem education, or elevate their minds to act without superintendence,\r\nup to the solemnity and delicacy of the duties to be performed in any\r\nproposed alteration of custom. In such hands the institution and service\r\nfor the reception and care of the dead, (which, with all its appliances,\r\nis one of the most elevated that can adorn the civic economy of a large\r\nand civilized community,) would be impracticable, or would become a\r\ncommon “dead-house,” or a revolting charnel. It may be confidently\r\naffirmed, that to accomplish what is needed to satisfy the feelings of\r\nthe population, on the points on which they are so painfully\r\nsusceptible, and to gain the public confidence requisite to carry out\r\nall the sanitary appliances and improvements that are requisite in\r\nconnexion with the practice of interment, would task the zeal and\r\nability, and unremitting attention of any, the best staff of educated\r\nmedical men that could be procured for such a service. The improvements\r\nwhich appear to be practicable, may be perceived on a consideration of\r\nthe information hereafter submitted, as to what is already gained under\r\narrangements of a comprehensive character.\r\n\r\n§ 112. The chief conclusions in respect to the proposed suburban\r\nparochial interments deducible from the present experience appear then\r\nto be,\r\n\r\n1. That the change of the practice of interments on the plan of suburban\r\nparochial or establishments of separate unions of parishes, while it\r\ngave immediate relief to the centre of the town, would create\r\nimpediments to the regular growth of the suburbs, and, ultimately, as\r\nthe interments increase, diminish the salubrity of the suburbs. §§ 107,\r\n108.\r\n\r\n2. That it would not _ultimately_ diminish any injurious effects arising\r\nfrom the practice of interments amidst the abodes of the living; and\r\nthat its chief effect would be to transfer such evils from the districts\r\nwhere they now prevail to the midst of the population of other\r\ndistricts. §§ 105, 110.\r\n\r\n3. That these results would only be obtained at a considerable expense\r\nto the rate-payers of the parishes from whence the practice of\r\ninterments is transferred. §§ 107, 108.\r\n\r\n4. That if burial in parochial grounds were transferred to such a\r\ndistance as not to interfere with the growth of the suburbs, the\r\nincreased distance of interments would occasion a proportionate increase\r\nof the expense of interments to the labouring classes of the community.\r\n§ 110.\r\n\r\n5. That inasmuch as the difficulty of obtaining the means of defraying\r\nthe expense of such classes of interments is frequently a powerful means\r\nof increasing the evil of the long delay of the interments, the measures\r\nproposed would tend to increase the most extensive and direct source of\r\ninjury to the health and morals of the survivors of the labouring\r\nclasses—the long retention of the corpse in their crowded and\r\nill-ventilated places of abode. §§ 43, 44.\r\n\r\n6. That interment by a parochial agency would aggravate or leave\r\nuntouched the other objections to the present practice of interments in\r\nthe metropolis. §§ 98, 99, 111.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Practicability of ensuring for the Public superior Interments at\r\n                           reduced Expenses._\r\n\r\nThe subject which may next be presented for consideration is how far the\r\npecuniary burthens may be reduced consistently with the sentiments\r\nexpressed by Jeremy Taylor, who deems it “a great act of piety, and\r\nhonourable, to inter our friends and relatives according to the\r\nproportions of their condition, and so to give testimony of our hope of\r\ntheir resurrection. So far is piety; beyond, it may be the ostentation\r\nand bragging of grief to serve worse ends. In this, as in everything\r\nelse, as our piety must not pass into superstition or vain expense, so\r\nneither must the excess be turned into parsimony, and chastised by\r\nnegligence and impiety to the memory of their dead.”\r\n\r\n§ 113. It appears, from detailed inquiries, made of tradesmen of\r\nexperience and respectability, who have answered explicitly the\r\nquestions put to them, that the expense of the materials at present\r\nsupplied for funerals admit of a reduction under general arrangements\r\nof, at the least, 50 per cent. The practical experience of these\r\nwitnesses would justify a dependence on their testimony as to the\r\npossible reduction of expenses, especially in case the public feeling\r\nshould be gained to change from the practice of having processions\r\nthrough the town to the practice of processions nearer to the\r\ncemeteries, by which the expenses of conveyance included in Mr. Wild’s\r\nestimate would be diminished. It is stated by the latter that the\r\ndisposition evinced by the higher classes, is to reduce expensive\r\ntrappings. He states:—\r\n\r\n  Is it not an occurrence of increasing frequency amongst the\r\n  respectable classes to express in their wills a wish to be buried\r\n  plainly, and at moderate expense?—Yes, it is; and they sometimes fix\r\n  sums. They fix such a sum as £150, where it has been usual to expend\r\n  such sums as £400 or £500. Parties of respectability now begin to\r\n  object to wearing cloaks and long hatbands. They are also beginning\r\n  to object to the use of feathers, and to the general display. The\r\n  system of performing funerals by written contract is also becoming\r\n  very prevalent. It is so frequent with me that I must have some\r\n  printed forms.\r\n\r\nMr. J. Browning of Manchester, member of the large society alluded to,\r\nas comprehending 150,000 members, states that they have evinced similar\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\n  I have belonged to the Odd Fellows’ Society and to the Foresters’\r\n  Society, and have served office in both in this town, Manchester. I\r\n  have belonged to them about 13 years.\r\n\r\n  Do you find any alteration in the dispositions of the members of\r\n  those societies in respect to the ceremonies observed and the array\r\n  at funerals?—Yes, a very great alteration.\r\n\r\n  In what respect?—In Manchester and Liverpool it used to be the\r\n  practice, when a member of either society died, that the members and\r\n  the officers attended decorated with their regalia, and followed the\r\n  corpse in procession. They used to assemble in bodies, as many as\r\n  two or three hundred, and there was a great deal of drinking. Now\r\n  these sort of processions are put a stop to by members, and there is\r\n  no regalia or processions used. Only a few members attend the\r\n  deceased member, and they attend only with black scarfs, white\r\n  gloves, and a black silk hatband, which is considered respectful.\r\n  But in some of the country places they still follow the practice,\r\n  and they will have the processions.\r\n\r\n  But the general tendency is to render the ceremony more simple?—Yes,\r\n  and there is much less drinking in the towns.\r\n\r\n§ 114. These manifestations are ascribable to a consciousness of the\r\nincompatibility of funereal displays through the crowded streets of\r\npopulous districts, and are consistent with the desire to obtain proper\r\nrespect for the deceased, shown in the objections to brief, meagre, and\r\nhurried services, and in the selection of secluded and decorated places\r\nof burial; it is shown, indeed, by the removal of the meretricious\r\ntrappings, which have lost their effect, and the preference of a more\r\nquiet simplicity which, under such circumstances, forms a better means\r\nof ensuring that respect.\r\n\r\n§ 115. Assuming the practicability of the accomplishment in this country\r\nof administrative arrangements such as have been accomplished, and are\r\nin habitual execution, abroad, to the great satisfaction of every class\r\nof society, a primary regulation, which would be practicable, would be\r\nto obtain for the public the opportunity of obtaining, at various\r\nscales, supplies of goods and services for funerals. To Mr. Wild the\r\nfollowing questions were put:—\r\n\r\n  Do you believe it to be practicable, by proper regulations, greatly\r\n  to reduce the existing charges of interments?—Yes, a very great\r\n  reduction indeed may be made—at least 50 per cent.\r\n\r\n  May it be confidently stated that under such reductions, whatever of\r\n  respectability in exterior is now attached to the trapping, or to\r\n  the mode of the ceremony, might be preserved?—Oh, yes; I should say\r\n  it might, and that they could scarcely fail to be increased.\r\n\r\n  Might not the expenses of the funerals of _the labouring classes_ be\r\n  greatly reduced without any reduction of the solemnity, or display\r\n  of proper and satisfactory respect?—Very considerable reductions may\r\n  be made, and attention to propriety very greatly increased. One\r\n  large item of expense is the expense of bearers: they cost, for a\r\n  walking funeral of an adult, 12_s._ Nine shillings of this expense\r\n  would be dispensed with if the burial were at a cemetery. This would\r\n  go towards the expense of conveyance, and contribute to the\r\n  compensation: besides, it would avoid for the mourners the\r\n  inconvenience and annoyance of walking through the crowded streets,\r\n  often in wet weather. One circumstance attending burial in\r\n  cemeteries would be, a diminution of the number of mourners: this\r\n  would occasion a diminution of the expense of funeral fittings.\r\n\r\n  What is the lowest price for which a coffin is made?—The lowest\r\n  priced coffin at this time, is the adult pauper’s coffin, with a\r\n  shroud, but with no cloth or nails, or name-plate or handles, and\r\n  costs 3_s._ 6_d._; the contract is usually for deal, inch thick, but\r\n  they never are; if they were, they could not be supplied under\r\n  4_s._; they often break when taken to the grave.\r\n\r\n  What would be the price of a coffin deemed respectable by the\r\n  labouring classes, with name-plate and appropriate fittings\r\n  complete, if manufactured for an extensive supply?—The average price\r\n  of such coffins is now about 35_s._; but the same quality of coffin\r\n  might be supplied on a large scale for about 17_s._\r\n\r\n  What would be the price of coffins for persons of the middle class,\r\n  if supplied on a similar scale?—The prices vary with them from 3_l._\r\n  to 10_l._; they have frequently double coffins; the same coffins\r\n  might be supplied from 30_s._ to 5_l._, or 50 per cent. less.\r\n\r\n§ 116. Mr. Hewitt, whose testimony has already been referred to, states,\r\nthat under general arrangements, it would be practicable to alleviate\r\nthe evil of the expense to an extent which would appear incredible. He\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n  I have so far carefully considered the subject, that I should be\r\n  ready to take a contract for the performance of burials at the\r\n  following rates:—For a labouring man, 1_l._ 10_s._ without burial\r\n  fees; for a labourer’s child, 15_s._, for a tradesman, 2_l._ 2_s._;\r\n  for a tradesman’s child, 1_l._ 1_s._; for a gentleman, 6_l._ 7_s._\r\n  6_d._; for a gentleman’s child, 3_l._ 10_s._ These expenses are for\r\n  “walking funerals;” the expenses of hearses and carriages would\r\n  depend on the distance, and would make from one to two guineas each\r\n  carriage extra.\r\n\r\n  All these, with the same descriptions of coffins, and with the same\r\n  respectability of attendance?—Yes, on the scale of about half the\r\n  existing burials in the metropolis; if it were for the whole, it\r\n  might be done much better, and in some instances perhaps at a\r\n  greater rate of reduction.\r\n\r\n§ 117. Mr. Wild gives, on similar grounds, the following estimate of the\r\npracticable rates of expenses of interment with all decent appliances:—\r\n\r\n ─────────┬───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────\r\n          │         Tradespeople.         │          Mechanics.\r\n ─────────┼───────────────┬───────────────┼───────────────┬───────────────\r\n          │    Adults.    │   Children.   │    Adults.    │   Children.\r\n ─────────┼───────┬───────┼───────┬───────┼───────┬───────┼───────┬───────\r\n          │ From. │  To.  │ From. │  To.  │ From. │  To.  │ From. │  To.\r\n ─────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n          │£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._│£. _s._\r\n Coffin   │ 1    5│ 4    4│ 0   15│ 1   10│ 0   17│ 1    5│ 0   10│ 0   15\r\n Fittings,│ 0   15│ 2    0│ 0   10│ 1    0│ 0   10│ 0   15│ 0    5│ 0   10\r\n   &c.    │       │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Sundries │       │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n Convey-  │ 1    1│ 4    4│ 1    1│ 2    2│ 0   17│ 1    1│ 0   10│ 1    1\r\n   ance   │       │       │       │       │       │       │       │\r\n ─────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────\r\n  Totals  │ 3    1│10    8│ 2    6│ 4   12│ 2    4│ 3    1│ 1    5│ 2    6\r\n ─────────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────┴───────\r\n\r\n§ 118. Next to the arrangements practicable for the regulation of the\r\nsupplies of goods, the most important practicable arrangements for\r\nreduction of expense are those which may regulate the services necessary\r\nfor interments. The item set forth in the above estimate of the charge\r\nfor conveyance is on the supposition of separate conveyance in the\r\npresent mode to the distant cemetery. With reference to the charge for\r\nthe poorer classes, Mr. Wild was asked—\r\n\r\n  Might not several sets of mourners be carried in one\r\n  conveyance?—Yes; that has often occurred to me, and it would tend to\r\n  reduce the expense materially. When two or three children have died\r\n  in one street, and they have had to be buried in the same cemetery,\r\n  I have asked the parents whether, as they had to go to the same\r\n  place, they objected to go in the same conveyance, and they have\r\n  frequently stated that they had no objections. These were of the\r\n  more respectable classes of mechanics.\r\n\r\n  In the fittings up of the coffins, is it considered that these would\r\n  be as good as those now used?—Quite as good.\r\n\r\n§ 119. One large item in the expense of funerals in the metropolis and\r\npopulous districts is the expense of hearers, § 115, who are provided\r\nfor each separate funeral. This expense is about 12_s._ for a set of\r\nbearers for the funeral of an adult of the working classes. Formerly\r\ncommon bearers were provided by the several parishes in the metropolis.\r\nAny arrangements of a national character would include the provision of\r\na better regulated class of bearers at a greatly reduced expense. In the\r\ncourse of the examination of Mr. Dix, the following information was\r\nelicited:—\r\n\r\n  It has been suggested that, if the hearse were always used, the\r\n  expense of bearers would be dispensed with in walking funerals. What\r\n  do you conceive would be the case?—I conceive that that would not be\r\n  the case, inasmuch as it would require bearers to remove the body\r\n  from the house to the hearse, and from the hearse to the grave. But\r\n  this difficulty might, I would suggest, be, to a great extent,\r\n  obviated by the establishment of public bearers, who should have the\r\n  exclusive right of removing all corpses, and whose rate of payment\r\n  should be fixed.\r\n\r\n  What is the present rate of payment of bearers to the grave for the\r\n  labouring classes?—It is 2_s._ 6_d._ each.\r\n\r\n  If public bearers were appointed, what might be the expense?—Much\r\n  less than one-half.\r\n\r\n  Do you think that this principle of management would be satisfactory\r\n  to the working classes?—It is in fact an old method. Formerly there\r\n  were bearers in all parishes, appointed by the churchwardens. In the\r\n  parish of St. Margaret’s, Westminster, and in most of the city\r\n  parishes, the practice continues to this day. In the form of bills\r\n  of the various parish dues the charge for bearers remains to the\r\n  present day.\r\n\r\n  Were these parish bearers less expensive than others?—No; they were\r\n  not.\r\n\r\n  Why were they discontinued?—In consequence of these bearers often\r\n  becoming undertakers themselves, which created a jealousy amongst\r\n  the trade, who refused to employ them, and the parishes had no power\r\n  to compel their employment. Also in consequence of the men being\r\n  elected by the churchwardens; they were seldom elected until they\r\n  became of an age that rendered them incapable of performing the\r\n  duties properly. They were not properly dressed, and were under no\r\n  control. In recommending public bearers, I presume they would be\r\n  under a different control than a parochial one or than the\r\n  churchwardens. I would add, however, that as one set of bearers\r\n  cannot carry a corpse more than a mile, I would only propose them in\r\n  aid of the hearses.\r\n\r\n§ 120. Mr. Wild, who had previously volunteered the suggestion as to the\r\nmeans of reducing the expenses of conveyance, by arrangements on an\r\nextensive scale, observes, further, in reference to the bearers—\r\n\r\n  “My first view as to the possible economy of funerals, was derived\r\n  from seeing that parish bearers were often made use of. The present\r\n  charge for bearers for mechanics is 12_s._ for the adults, or 3_s._\r\n  per bearer. I was asking one of the parish bearers what he was\r\n  allowed, as the charge was included in the burial dues, which were\r\n  1_l._ 5_s._ 6_d._ He told me they were paid 6_d._ per bearer, or\r\n  2_s._ the set. He told me that they had borne six to the grave that\r\n  morning, and he had earned 3_s._ himself. This at the usual charge\r\n  would have been 3_l._ 12_s._; but properly provided bearers at the\r\n  cemetery might reduce the charges still further, perhaps to 3_d._\r\n  each case.”\r\n\r\n§ 121. Before submitting for consideration any detailed arrangements for\r\nsecuring, in a manner satisfactory to the people, better funerals at\r\nless oppressive charges, it is necessary to premise, that there appear\r\nto be no grounds to expect the extensive spontaneous adoption of\r\nimproved regulations by the labouring classes without aid _ab extra_.\r\nThe labour of communicating information to them, to be attended to at\r\nthe time it is wanted, would be immense. Their sources of information on\r\nthe occurrence of such events are either poor neighbours, as ignorant as\r\nthemselves, or persons who are interested in misleading them and\r\nprofiting by their ignorance, to continue expensive and mischievous\r\npractices. As against such an evil as the undue retention of the bodies\r\namidst the living the usual mode of effecting a change would be simply\r\nby a prohibitory ordinance, § 91, of which information would be conveyed\r\npractically by the enforcement of penalties for disobedience of the law,\r\nwhich it is assumed they know. The appointment of a responsible agency,\r\nwhich would be respected, to convey the information of what may be\r\ndeemed requisite for the protection of the living and exercise influence\r\nto initiate a change of practice, appears to all the practical witnesses\r\nexamined, § 102, to be a preferable course, as being the most suitable\r\nto the temper of the people, and as being the least expensive, as well\r\nas the most efficient. The very desolate and unprotected condition of\r\nthe survivors of the poorest classes, on the occurrence of a death in\r\nlarge towns, appears to render some intervention for their guidance and\r\nprotection at that moment peculiarly requisite, as a simple act of\r\nbeneficence. Mr. Wild was asked—\r\n\r\n  Amongst the poorer classes, is not the widow often made ill during\r\n  the protracted delay of the burial?—Yes, very often. They have come\r\n  to me in tears, and begged for accommodation, which I have given\r\n  them. On observing to them, you seem very ill; a common reply is,\r\n  “Yes, I feel very ill. I am very much harassed, and I have no one to\r\n  assist me.” I infer from such expressions that the mental anxiety\r\n  occasioned by the expense, and want of means to obtain the money, is\r\n  the frequent cause of their illness. My opinion is, that unless the\r\n  undertaker gave two-thirds of them time or accommodation for\r\n  payment, they would not be able to bury the dead at all.\r\n\r\n  You state that they have no persons to assist them; do they\r\n  frequently, or ever, on such occasions, see any persons of\r\n  education, or of influence, from whom they might receive aid or\r\n  advice?—I never hear of such persons unless they happen to be\r\n  connected with some local association, when the survivors are\r\n  visited and get advice, and sometimes relief.\r\n\r\n  If any gentleman were to visit them as a public officer, as the\r\n  officer of a board of health, would his recommendations have\r\n  influence with them?—Very great: the doctor now has the greatest\r\n  influence with them, but he does not attend them after the death.\r\n\r\nJohn Downing, a mechanic, the secretary of a Burial Society, whose duty\r\nit was to visit the remains of the deceased members, was asked—\r\n\r\n  After the death of the party have you ever, in visiting the\r\n  deceased, met any professional person or any gentleman attending to\r\n  give advice or consolation to the widow?—No. Never to my knowledge.\r\n\r\n  Then on what advice will the widow act on the occurrence of a\r\n  death?—On the advice of the poor people in the neighbourhood, or of\r\n  any friends or relatives that may chance to call upon them; but I\r\n  never knew either medical man or minister attend professionally to\r\n  give advice or consolation.\r\n\r\n  Is any notice of the death sent to the minister?—The working-classes\r\n  never think of that; the first thing and the only thing thought of\r\n  by them is to scrape together the money for the funeral.\r\n\r\n  Do you think that a medical officer, an officer of public health,\r\n  attending gratuitously to inspect the body and register the cause of\r\n  death, and to give advice as to the proper means of conducting the\r\n  funeral, and the steps to be taken for the health of the living\r\n  would be respectfully received and have influence?—I am very\r\n  confident that he would have a very hearty welcome. I think a deal\r\n  of benefit would be derived from it to the feelings as well as the\r\n  health of the parties.\r\n\r\n§ 122. The curate of a populous district mentioned to me, as\r\nillustrative of the practice in the crowded neighbourhoods in the\r\nmetropolis, that he had for a time lived in a house let off in lodgings\r\nto respectable persons in the middle ranks of life, and though his\r\nprofession was known in the house, yet three deaths had taken place in\r\nit of which he had no notice whatever, and only knew of them at the time\r\nof the funeral. All the witnesses who have had experience amongst the\r\nlabouring classes, concur in the expression of confidence that the\r\nvisits and intervention of a public officer would at such a time be well\r\nreceived by the poorest classes.\r\n\r\nMr. Hewitt was asked—\r\n\r\n  Do you conceive that respectable officers visiting the house of all\r\n  classes of the deceased immediately after the death, as medical\r\n  officers and officers of public health, to inquire as to the causes\r\n  of death and register them, would long fail to acquire powerful\r\n  influence in the suggestion of voluntary and beneficial sanitary\r\n  arrangements?—I think that an officer appointed from the first class\r\n  of physicians would be better received than a local medical man—as\r\n  an officer of the public health, whose opinions would be more\r\n  prized, and consequently would be sure to be received by all most\r\n  respectfully. Such an officer is calculated to do more good than can\r\n  easily be conceived, and would be able to execute such duties over\r\n  an extensive district.\r\n\r\n  Would they have that sort of faith in a physician that they would\r\n  not have in any local medical officer?—They would receive well any\r\n  gentleman, and would act upon his advice.\r\n\r\n  On the occurrence of a death, is there any one person of education,\r\n  or of superior condition in life, who comes near the working\r\n  classes?—Not one that I am aware; no one attends for such a purpose;\r\n  if any such person comes it must be accidental.\r\n\r\n  It may perhaps be presumed that it is rare that any death occurs\r\n  without some medical man or medical officer having attended the\r\n  case?—Very few, and in those cases inquests are usually held.\r\n\r\n  In the majority of cases, therefore, the labouring classes, on the\r\n  occurrence of a death, are left either to the advice of any\r\n  interested person who may come amongst them, or to the influence of\r\n  their equally uninformed neighbours?—Yes, certainly, that is the\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n§ 123. The principle of the measure proposed, _i. e._ a certificate of\r\nthe fact, and the cause of death, given on view of the body, and the\r\nnon-interment without such certificate, has been in operation perhaps\r\nduring two centuries. In the year 1595, orders were issued by the Privy\r\nCouncil to the justices, enjoining them, that wherever the plague\r\nappeared, they would see that the ministers of the church, or three or\r\nfour substantial householders, appointed persons to view the bodies of\r\nall who died, before they were suffered to be buried. They were to\r\ncertify to the minister or the churchwarden, of what disease it was\r\nprobable each individual had died. The minister or the churchwarden was\r\nto make a weekly return of the numbers in his parish that were infected,\r\nor had died, and the diseases of which it was probable they had died.\r\nThese returns were to be made to the neighbouring justices, and by them\r\nto the clerk of the peace, who was to enter them in a book to be kept\r\nfor the purpose. The justices, who assembled every three weeks, were to\r\nforward the results to the Lords of the Privy Council. It is supposed\r\nthat this scheme of registration gave rise to the bills of mortality,\r\nwhich have been preserved without interruption from the year 1603 until\r\nthe present period. It is conjectured also, that the appointment of\r\n“searchers” originated at the same time. The alarm of the plague having\r\nsubsided, the office of searcher was, until the recent appointments of\r\nregistrars under the new Registration Act, given by the parish officers\r\nto two old women in each parish, frequently pew-openers, who, having\r\nviewed the body, demanded a fee of two shillings, in addition to which\r\nthey expected to be supplied with some liquor, and gave a certificate of\r\nthe fact and cause of death as they were informed of it, and this\r\ncertificate was received by the minister as a warrant for the interment.\r\n\r\n§ 124. The Rev. Mr. Stone observes on this topic—\r\n\r\n  It would be well if the burial of the dead could be expedited by\r\n  some agency created for the purpose; something, for instance, like\r\n  the obsolete office of searcher. I never heard but one person make\r\n  an objection even to those inferior functionaries, and that one was\r\n  an educated person, who would probably have withdrawn the objection,\r\n  had the agency been one of a more refined, intelligent, and\r\n  conciliatory character. It might be a more delicate matter to secure\r\n  the removal of the corpse to be deposited elsewhere for any\r\n  considerable time before the burial; though, judging from one\r\n  practice, which has fallen under my observation, I feel justified in\r\n  supposing, that even this would not be met with universal\r\n  repugnance. A similar thing is now often done spontaneously from a\r\n  pecuniary motive, and for the purpose of evading burial dues. In my\r\n  parish ground, and, I believe, in others, the fees for the burial of\r\n  a non-parishioner, or person dying out of the parish, are double\r\n  those payable for a parishioner. But, if the undertaker employed is\r\n  a parishioner, this extra payment is easily evaded, by his\r\n  accommodating the corpse on his own premises. It is brought there\r\n  some time before the burial, and frequently from a considerable\r\n  distance; it then becomes a resident parishioner, and forthwith\r\n  claims the privilege of a parishioner. It claims to be admitted into\r\n  our burial ground at single fees; and, of course, the claim so made\r\n  cannot easily be disallowed. Indeed, by a little management, this\r\n  smuggling of dead bodies may be effected so that my clerk and\r\n  sexton, the only officers in my preventive service, may themselves\r\n  know nothing about it. It is probable, however, that such sanitary\r\n  arrangements as those adverted to would be best facilitated, and it\r\n  is certain that much mischief would be entirely prevented, by a\r\n  reduction in the amount of burial expenses. Indeed these expenses\r\n  ought, if possible, to be reduced for the sake of all classes,\r\n  whether they arise from too high a rate of burial fees, from the\r\n  prejudices of the people, or from the advantage that may be taken of\r\n  those prejudices or other circumstances by a class so directly and\r\n  deeply interested as the undertakers.\r\n\r\n§ 125. Several physicians of eminence in the metropolis, who are\r\nconversant with the state and feelings of families of the middle and\r\nhigher classes on the occurrence of a death, have expressed their\r\nconfidence, that the most respectable families, who are stunned by the\r\nblow, and are ignorant of the detail of the steps to be taken when a\r\ndeath has occurred, would gladly pay for the attendance of any\r\nrespectable and responsible person, on whose information they might,\r\nunder such circumstances, rely. As already stated, the physician takes\r\nno cognizance of the arrangements for interments, and knowing the\r\nfeelings that commonly arise when the undertaker’s bill is presented,\r\ncarefully avoids giving advice, or doing anything that may implicate him\r\nwith the arrangements for the interment.\r\n\r\n§ 126. In opening the consideration of remedial measures, it appears\r\nincumbent to represent that there are many who, viewing what has been\r\naccomplished abroad, and the inconvenience experienced in the metropolis\r\nin respect to the oldest private trading burial grounds, object on\r\nprinciple to the abandonment of acknowledged public functions and\r\nservices, and to leaving the necessities of the public as sources of\r\nprofit to private, and (practically for every-day purposes)\r\nirresponsible associations. They submit, that if the steps in this\r\ndirection cannot be retraced, the public have claims that at all events\r\nthey shall be stayed. Such opinions may, perhaps, be the best\r\nrepresented in the following portion of the communication from the Rev.\r\nWm. Stone.\r\n\r\n  It may be thought that, in alluding to these private burial grounds,\r\n  I have expressed myself strongly, and indeed I am not anxious to\r\n  disavow having done so. The subject seems to me to justify such a\r\n  tone of expression. In all ages and nations, the burial of the dead\r\n  has been invested with peculiar sanctity. As the office that closes\r\n  the visible scene of human existence, it concentrates in itself the\r\n  most touching exercise of our affections towards objects endeared to\r\n  us in this life, and the most intense and stirring anxieties that we\r\n  can feel respecting an invisible state. And, appealing thus to\r\n  common sympathies of our nature, it has been universally marked by\r\n  observances intended to give it importance or impressiveness. The\r\n  faith and usage of Christians have given remarkable prominence to\r\n  this duty. The ecclesiastical institutes of our own country indicate\r\n  a jealous solicitude for the safe and religious custody of the\r\n  receptacles of the dead; and there are few of us, perhaps, to whom\r\n  those receptacles are not hallowed by thoughts and recollections of\r\n  the deepest personal interest. It is reasonable, then, that the\r\n  reverential impressions thus accumulated within us should shrink\r\n  from the contact of more selfish and vulgar associations. And one\r\n  may be excused for thinking and speaking strongly in reprobation of\r\n  a system which degrades the burial of the dead into a trade.\r\n  Throughout the whole scheme and working of this system, there is an\r\n  exclusive spirit of money-getting, which is revoltingly heartless;\r\n  and in some of its details there is an indecency which I have felt\r\n  myself compelled to allude to in the tone of strong condemnation.\r\n\r\n  It is surely desirable that a state of things so vulgar and\r\n  demoralizing, should be put an end to, but at present there seems no\r\n  prospect of it. Of course, during the continuance of a competition\r\n  such as I have described, our parishioners will never return to our\r\n  parish burial grounds, and I have already remarked, that if they\r\n  did, they might not get interment there, inasmuch as it would,\r\n  perhaps, be found impossible to make our parochial system meet the\r\n  wants of any crowded population. There is little better chance of\r\n  the present offensive system of burial being superseded by the joint\r\n  stock cemeteries; for to the mass of our population these cemeteries\r\n  hold out hardly any advantages which are not possessed by the\r\n  private burial grounds, while they have to compete with those\r\n  grounds under disadvantages greater, in some instances, than those\r\n  which our churchyards have to contend with.\r\n\r\n  Indeed, even if it were practicable, I should be sorry to see our\r\n  people handed over for burial to a joint stock company. I am very\r\n  far from saying this out of any sympathy with the popular, and often\r\n  indiscriminate and unreasonable jealousy felt towards all joint\r\n  stock companies. Nay, I see obvious reasons why the cemeteries of\r\n  such companies should be a great improvement upon the present system\r\n  of private speculation in burial grounds. And it may be thought\r\n  that, as a clergyman and an interested party, I may naturally prefer\r\n  these cemeteries, because their proprietors, unlike the private\r\n  speculators, are required to indemnify the clergy for loss of fees\r\n  by some amount of pecuniary compensation. But I do sympathize with\r\n  the common repugnance to consign to joint stock companies the\r\n  solemnities of Christian burial; and I believe that this repugnance\r\n  is not more common than it is strong. “And so,” said a highly\r\n  intelligent gentleman, pointing to a cemetery of this class, “the\r\n  time is come when Christian burial is made an article of traffic.”\r\n  And since the legislature has been reported to be contemplating the\r\n  removal of burials from populous places, it has been commonly\r\n  suspected of having been led to entertain the measure through the\r\n  influence of joint stock cemetery proprietors. In fact the\r\n  repugnance in question is no more than what I have already adverted\r\n  to. It is the state of feeling which shrinks from associating the\r\n  touching and impressive solemnities of burial with the profits of\r\n  trade. So far as the trading principle is involved, the joint stock\r\n  company is no better than the private speculator. However\r\n  disinterested may have been the motives which have induced some to\r\n  become shareholders in these companies, and I have been assured upon\r\n  authority which I respect, that many have done so without any\r\n  expectation or hope of profit upon their shares, yet the primary and\r\n  effective character of these associations is undeniably that of\r\n  trading associations, and they cannot be rescued from that character\r\n  by even numerous individual exceptions. Their managers, like the\r\n  proprietors of the private grounds, are assiduous in soliciting\r\n  attention to their lists of prices; and affiches, painted in large\r\n  letters, and placed at various outlets of the metropolis, with\r\n  genuine mercantile officiousness, direct the public, as in a case\r\n  close by my own parish, “To the E. L. Cemetery, only one mile and\r\n  a-half.” Surely we may say, that this system also involves much that\r\n  is inconsistent with reverential impressions of the sanctity of\r\n  burial, much that must either offend or deteriorate the better\r\n  feeling of our population. Then again, as regards burial services,\r\n  and other details in the working of the system, with what security\r\n  can we consign these to the tender mercies of a trading company? Why\r\n  should not the money-getting principle eventually come to operate\r\n  upon these points also, and, as in the private burial grounds, tempt\r\n  shareholders to sanction indecent and mischievous condescensions to\r\n  the interests, habits, tastes, and caprices of the people? What\r\n  security, at least, is there equal to that which is afforded by a\r\n  clergy and parochial establishments, responsible to the civil and\r\n  ecclesiastical authorities of the country, or which would be\r\n  afforded by what, for reasons before mentioned, I should think still\r\n  preferable, a national plan of burial, placed under a departmental\r\n  control of Government?\r\n\r\nThe remedial measures hereafter submitted for consideration have been\r\ndeduced directly from the actual necessities experienced within the\r\nfield of inquiry, and such only are submitted as clearly suggested\r\nthemselves without reference to any external experience. The following\r\npreliminary view of the experience of other nations is presented for\r\nconsideration on account of the confirmatory evidence which it contains,\r\nas well as the instances to be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examples of successful Legislation for the Improvement of the Practice\r\n                             of Interment._\r\n\r\n§ 127. It appears that the evil of the expensive interments consequent\r\non the monopoly which the nature of the event, and the feelings of\r\nsurvivors, gives to the person nearest at hand for the performance of\r\nthe undertaker’s service, is checked by special arrangements in America.\r\nIn Boston, and most of the large towns in America, there is a Board of\r\nHealth which nominates a superintendent of burial grounds, who is\r\ninvariably a person of special qualifications, and generally a medical\r\nman. All undertakers are licensed by the Board of Health, by whom the\r\nlicence may at any time be revoked. The sexton of the church which the\r\ndeceased attended is usually the undertaker. The bills of the undertaker\r\nare made out on a blank form, furnished by the public superintendent of\r\ninterment, to whom all bills are submitted, and by whom they are audited\r\nand allowed, before they are presented for payment to the relations or\r\nfriends of the deceased. Previous to interment, the undertaker must\r\nobtain from the physician who last attended the deceased, a certificate\r\nspecifying the profession, age, time of illness, and cause of death of\r\nthe deceased. This certificate is presented to the superintendent of\r\nfunerals. An abstract of these certificates, signed by the\r\nsuperintendent of funerals, is printed every week in the public journals\r\nof the city. The cost of a funeral for a person in the position of life\r\nof the highest class of tradesmen in Boston, is about fifty dollars, or\r\n10_l._ English, exclusive of the cost of the tomb. The price of a good\r\nmahogany coffin would be fifteen dollars, or 3_l._ 5_s._ The price of a\r\nmost elegant mahogany coffin would be perhaps double that price. The\r\nprice of a pine coffin, such as are used for the persons of the\r\nlabouring classes, would be about four dollars. There is a peculiarity\r\nin the coffins made in the United States,—that a portion of the lid,\r\nabout a foot from the upper end, opens upon a hinge. This, when opened,\r\nexposes to view the face of the deceased, which is covered with glass.\r\nThe survivors are thus enabled at the last moment to take a view of the\r\ndeceased, without the danger of infection. In Germany, the coffins are\r\nnailed down, every blow of the hammer frequently drawing a scream from\r\nthe female survivors.\r\n\r\n§ 128. In the chief German states it is adopted as a principle, that\r\nprovision shall be made, and it is made successfully, for meeting the\r\nnecessities of the population in respect to the undertakers’ supplies of\r\nservice and materials; and that on the occurrence of a death, those\r\nnecessities shall not be given up as the subject of common trading\r\nprofits to whatsoever irresponsible person may obtain the monopoly of\r\nthem. At Franckfort provision is made for these services and supplies of\r\nmaterial at the lowest cost to the public as part of a series of\r\narrangements comprehending the verification of the fact of death on view\r\nof the body, the edifice for the reception and care of the dead previous\r\nto interment, and the public cemeteries, all under the superintendence\r\nof superior and responsible medical officers. The expenses of the\r\nsupplies of materials are reduced so low under these arrangements, that\r\nthey no longer enter into serious consideration as a burthen to be met\r\non such occasions.\r\n\r\n§ 129. At Berlin, a contract is made by the Government with one person\r\nto secure funeral materials and services for the public at certain fixed\r\nscales of prices. The materials and services are stated to be of a\r\nperfectly satisfactory character; and yet the undertaker’s charge for a\r\nfuneral such as would here cost for an artisan 4_l._ and upwards, is not\r\nmore than 15_s._ English money; the charge for a middle class funeral is\r\nabout 2_l._, and for a funeral of the opulent class of citizens is\r\nabout, 10_l._ And yet I am assured that the contractors’ profits on the\r\nextensive supplies required are deemed too high, and that the Government\r\nwill, on the renewal of the contract, find it necessary to protect the\r\npoorer classes by a contract at a lower rate.\r\n\r\n§ 130. At Paris, interments are made the subject of a _fisc_; but a\r\ncontract is made with one head to secure services and supplies to the\r\nprivate individual at reduced rates, and so far the system works\r\nadvantageously to the public.\r\n\r\n§ 131. The whole of the interments are there performed, and the various\r\nburial and religious dues collected and paid under one contract, by\r\njoint contractors for the public service at regulated prices, called the\r\n_Service des Pompes Funèbres_. This establishment annually buries\r\ngratis, upwards of 7000 destitute persons, or nearly one-third of all\r\nwho die in the city. The funerals and religious services are divided\r\ninto nine classes, comprehending various settled particulars of service,\r\nfor which a price is fixed. The appointed service for any of these\r\nclasses may be had on the terms specified in a tariff. This is found to\r\nbe a great benefit to testators and survivors, as it enables them to\r\nsettle the ceremonial with certainty, and without the possibility of any\r\nextortion. The first class of funerals are of great pomp: they include\r\nbearers, crosses, plumes, eighteen mourning coaches and attendants,\r\ngrand mass at church, 120 lbs. of wax tapers, an anniversary service,\r\nand material of mourning cloth; and also the attendance of Monsieur le\r\nCuré, two vicars, twenty-one priests, six singers and ten chorister\r\nboys, and two instrumental performers, at a cost of 145_l._, for a\r\nfuneral superior in magnificence perhaps to any private funeral in\r\nEngland. The charge for the service and materials of the ninth class, in\r\nwhich there is the attendance of a vicar and a priest, and of a bass\r\nsinger or chorister for the mass, is about 15_s._ of English money. In\r\nthe service ordinaire there is less religious service, and that is\r\nperformed gratuitously. The only charge made is the price of the coffin,\r\nwhich is five or seven francs, according to the size: the coffin is\r\ncovered by a pall, and carried on a plain hearse, drawn by two black\r\nhorses. This funeral is conducted by a superintendent and four\r\nassistants, exclusive of the driver. The following is the scale of\r\ncharges, and the numbers interred under each, during two years:—\r\n\r\n ─────────────────────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬───────┬──────\r\n                      │      │      │      │      │       │\r\n                      │ 1st  │ 2nd  │ 3rd  │ 4th  │  5th  │ 6th\r\n                      │Class.│Class.│Class.│Class.│Class. │Class.\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼──────\r\n                      │  £.  │  £.  │  £.  │  £.  │£. _s._│  £.\r\n Religious Funeral    │      │      │      │      │       │\r\n   Service            │    24│    19│    11│     8│  5  10│     2\r\n Anniversary Religious│      │      │      │      │       │\r\n   Service            │    26│    20│    12│     9│  6   0│     3\r\n Undertaker’s Material│      │      │      │      │       │\r\n   and Service        │    95│    83│    49│    23│ 14  10│     5\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼──────\r\n    Total Expenses    │   145│   122│    72│    40│ 26   0│    10\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼──────┼───────┼──────\r\n      Number of { 1839│    23│    52│   138│   256│    828│ 1,457\r\n        Burials { 1841│    30│    47│   188│   201│    816│ 1,655\r\n ─────────────────────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴───────┴──────\r\n ─────────────────────┬──────┬───────┬──────┬────────┬──────────┬───────\r\n                      │      │       │      │Total of│          │\r\n                      │ 7th  │  8th  │ 9th  │the nine│ Service  │General\r\n                      │Class.│Class. │Class.│Classes.│Ordinaire.│Total.\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼───────┼──────┼────────┼──────────┼───────\r\n                      │  £.  │£. _s._│ _s._ │        │          │\r\n Religious Funeral    │      │       │      │        │          │\r\n   Service            │     1│  0  16│    11│        │          │\r\n Anniversary Religious│      │       │      │        │          │\r\n   Service            │      │       │      │        │          │\r\n Undertaker’s Material│      │       │      │        │          │\r\n   and Service        │     3│  1  11│     4│        │          │\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼───────┼──────┼────────┼──────────┼───────\r\n    Total Expenses    │     4│  2   7│    15│        │          │\r\n ─────────────────────┼──────┼───────┼──────┼────────┼──────────┼───────\r\n      Number of { 1839│ 2,523│    141│   530│   5,958│    14,087│ 20,045\r\n        Burials { 1841│ 2,377│     78│   715│   6,107│    14,185│ 20,292\r\n ─────────────────────┴──────┴───────┴──────┴────────┴──────────┴───────\r\n\r\n§ 132. On the number of burials in Paris for 1841, the gross income\r\nwould be about 80,000_l._ per annum. Out of this sum the contractor pays\r\nthe fixed salaries of the staff of officers, which consists of a chief\r\ninspector of funeral ceremonies, of 27 other directors besides, 78\r\nbearers, one inspector of cemeteries and four keepers; officers chiefly\r\nappointed by the municipality. The total amount of the salaries which he\r\npays is 5862_l._, English money. He keeps an establishment of 30 hearses\r\nand 76 carriages, with suites of minor attendants properly clothed, and\r\ninters the 7000 of the pauper class gratuitously. The last contractor\r\npaid annually to the municipality 17,000_l._, which sum was chiefly\r\ndevoted to ecclesiastical objects. The large profits which he realized\r\nled to considerable competition, and a new contract was recently sealed\r\nfor nine years, securing for public purposes an annual income of\r\n28,000_l._\r\n\r\nBesides this amount, there is a revenue of about 20,000_l._ per annum\r\nderived by the municipality from the sale of tombs, and from the tax on\r\ninterments, which is twenty francs for the interment of every adult, and\r\nten francs upon children under seven years of age. One-fifth of this\r\nrevenue, or about 4000_l._, is devoted to the hospitals.\r\n\r\n§ 133. The remains of those who die in the public hospitals in Paris,\r\nand are not claimed by their friends, are, after dissection, merely\r\nenclosed in a coarse cloth and deposited in the ground, without any\r\nfunereal rites. This number amounts, as stated, to no less than 7000\r\nannually. The total average deaths in Paris is from 28,000 to 30,000\r\nannually. This, in a population of 900,000, gives about one burial to\r\nevery thirty of the population annually, which is nearly as large a\r\nproportion of annual deaths and burials as that in Manchester. The\r\ndeaths and burials in the British metropolis (though varying in\r\ndifferent parts, from 1 in 28, as in Whitechapel, to 1 in 56, as in\r\nHackney, chiefly according to the condition of the locality) average for\r\nthe entire population of 1,800,000 inhabitants, one death or burial in\r\nevery forty-two of the inhabitants, or one-fourth less of burials than\r\nat Paris in proportion to the population. In Paris the average number of\r\ninhabitants to every house is 36. If the mortality were there in the\r\nproportion of London there would be 7,000 fewer burials yearly. An\r\nassertion may be ventured, that more than this excess of mortality is\r\nascribable to the still lower sanitary condition of the labouring\r\npopulation in Paris, which has its concomitant in a still lower moral\r\ncondition than yet prevails amongst the population of our large\r\ntowns.[26]\r\n\r\n§ 134. In Paris the law requires that the dead shall be interred within\r\ntwenty-four hours after the decease, but this law may be evaded by\r\nneglect to give notice of the death. The general practice, however,\r\nappears to be, that interments take place within two days.\r\n\r\n§ 135. In America, the later regulations manifest the tendency of the\r\ngeneral experience to connect the regulations of interment with the\r\ngeneral regulations for the protection of the public health, and to do\r\nthis by single, specially qualified, paid, and responsible officers,\r\nrather than by Boards, or by any unskilled and honorary agency. The\r\nrevised statutes of Massachusetts introduce the alternative of the\r\nappointment of a single officer. Every town is empowered to appoint a\r\nBoard of Health, “or a health officer:” and the Board so appointed may\r\nappoint “a physician to the Board.” The Board acting by such officer may\r\ndestroy, remove, or prevent, as the case may require, all nuisances,\r\nsources of filth, and causes of sickness. “Whenever any such nuisance or\r\nsource of filth, or cause of sickness shall be found on private\r\nproperty, the Board of Health, or health officer, shall order the owner\r\nor occupant thereof at his own expense to remove the same within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and if the owner or occupant shall neglect so to do,\r\nhe shall forfeit a sum not exceeding one hundred dollars,” c. 21, s. 10.\r\nIn cases of the refusal of entry into private property, on complaint to\r\na magistrate, the magistrate may thereupon issue his warrant, “directed\r\nto the sheriff, or either of his deputies, or to any constable of such\r\ntown, commanding them to take sufficient aid, and being accompanied by\r\ntwo or more members of the said Board of Health, between the hours of\r\nsunset and sunrise, to repair to the place where such nuisance, source\r\nof filth, or cause of sickness complained of may be, and to destroy,\r\nremove, or prevent, the same, under the direction of such members of the\r\nBoard of Health.” The cleansing of the streets and houses is in most\r\ncases included in the functions of the Board of Health, or of the health\r\nofficer, who regulates the removal of all refuse. Sec. 14, c. 21.\r\n\r\nEvery householder, when any of his family are taken ill, is required, on\r\na penalty of one hundred dollars,—and every physician in the like\r\npenalty, on ascertaining that any person whom he visits is infected with\r\nthe small-pox, or other disease dangerous to the public health,—to give\r\nimmediate notice to the officers of public health, and they may, “unless\r\nthe condition of such person is such as not to admit of his removal\r\nwithout danger of life,” remove him at once to the public hospital,\r\nwhatever may be his station in life. Sec. 43 and 44, c. 21.\r\n\r\nI have been favoured by Dr. Griscom, the inspector of interments at New\r\nYork, with the copy of a report on the sanitary condition of the\r\npopulation of that city; which points out the great extent of deaths\r\nthat are preventible by the adoption of means similar to those\r\nrecommended in the General Report for the improvement of the sanitary\r\ncondition of the population in Great Britain. This report, revealing\r\nextensive causes of death in New York, of which a large proportion of\r\nthe population must have been unaware, may be adduced in proof of the\r\nimmense services derivable from such an office, when zealously executed,\r\nin guarding against evils more destructive than wars.[27]\r\n\r\n§ 136. In Munich, and in other towns in Germany, the visits and\r\nverification of the fact of death as the warrant for interment, is felt\r\nto be an important public security, and is highly popular; but one cause\r\nof its popularity is the jurisprudential functions of the officer of\r\nhealth, as means of preventing premature interments, and the escape of\r\ncrime; for comparatively little attention appears yet to have been given\r\nto the practical means afforded by the office of tracing out and\r\nremoving the causes of disease. The difficulty appears to be in respect\r\nto the jurisprudential functions of the officers of health to satisfy\r\nthe public anxiety for the exercise of solemn care in _every_ case of a\r\nmultitude, where only one case in that multitude will, on the doctrine\r\nof chances, be a case calling for intervention; and where it is not\r\nprovided, as it may and ought to be, that the discovery of that one\r\nshall be a matter of deep personal interest, instead of a mere source of\r\ntrouble to the officer himself, his examinations may be expected to\r\ndegenerate into a routine in which the intended security will fail in\r\nthe less obvious cases.\r\n\r\nIn later times very comprehensive regulations as to the sites and\r\nmanagement of cemeteries, and the service of officers of health, who\r\nhave charge of the cemeteries, have been adopted throughout the Austrian\r\ndominions, and it is stated that they work very satisfactorily. On the\r\noccasion of every death by accident or violence, or of suspicion, a\r\nclose inquiry as to the causes is made by the town physician. In Vienna\r\na strict inquiry is made into every such death by the following\r\nofficers, who all attend for that purpose;—namely, the town physician,\r\nthe surgeon in chief, the professor of pathological anatomy, a lawyer,\r\nand in some cases, when analyses are required, a chemist. The results of\r\ntheir examinations are set forth in a “protocol,” a carefully prepared\r\ndocument, “_bien motivé_,” which sometimes takes two or three days in\r\ndrawing up. The effect of this inquiry is the prevention, to a great\r\nextent, of crimes of violence, and the production of public confidence.\r\nIt is stated to be highly popular.\r\n\r\n§ 137. In Paris some cases have of late occurred, which have created\r\nmuch public uneasiness by the evidence they afforded of the defective\r\norganization of the service of the officers of health, and occasioned it\r\nrecently to undergo an examination with the view to the adoption of\r\nbetter securities. It appears that, from a very early period, to satisfy\r\nthe public solicitude, the law required the fact of the reality of a\r\ndeath to be verified by the personal visit and inspection of the Maire\r\nof the district of the city where the death had taken place.\r\nSubsequently, the Maires were allowed to delegate this duty to officers\r\nof their own nomination, persons qualified for the duties by a medical\r\neducation, and who were called _Officiers de Santé_. But the\r\nappointments thus made by the Maires did not give public satisfaction;\r\nand in the year 1806 it was required that the persons appointed as\r\n“officiers de santé” by the Maires, should be chosen by them from\r\namongst the doctors in medicine and surgery who were attached to the\r\npublic hospitals. They appear, however, to have been mostly chosen\r\nwithout reference to public qualifications, from their own medical\r\nfriends in private practice. This arrangement of appointing persons in\r\nprivate practice appears to have prevailed in other countries, and to\r\nhave frustrated much of the benefits otherwise derivable from the\r\ninstitution. Thirty-five of these private practitioners are now\r\nappointed to perform the duty. Reports have gained ground that from\r\nnegligent discharge of the duty, persons had even been buried alive, and\r\nthat the verification had been given in cases of murder. On a recent\r\ncommission of inquiry, the celebrated surgeon, M. Orfila, thus speaks of\r\nthe necessity of the verification of the fact of the decease.\r\n\r\n  “It is possible to be interred alive! Interments may take place\r\n  after murder, committed with the knife or by means of poison,\r\n  without a suspicion being created that the death has been occasioned\r\n  by violence. Ignorance or malevolence may attribute to crime deaths\r\n  that have occurred from natural causes!”\r\n\r\nAfter referring to ancient cases in which evidence was recorded of\r\nparties having been buried alive, he adduces the following recent\r\ninstances of parties having been interred without due verification of\r\nthe cause of death by the _Officier de Santé_:—\r\n\r\n  “We all know the case of the death of the grocer in the Rue de la\r\n  Paix, who died of poison by arsenic. The interment took place after\r\n  the verification of the death. In about a month afterwards I was\r\n  called upon to examine the body as to the poison. Although the\r\n  putrefaction of the corpse of the person who was of a very full\r\n  habit had been much advanced, I was enabled to discover the presence\r\n  of the arsenic by which the crime had been perpetrated.\r\n\r\n  “The widow Danzelle, of the Rue Beauregard, was found dead in her\r\n  bed on the 1st of January, 1826. The certificate of the decease was\r\n  given in due form to the relations to authorise the interment. In\r\n  that certificate, given to M. le Commissaire de Police, the medical\r\n  practitioner declared, ‘the death has taken place, and it appears\r\n  that it has been occasioned by a commotion of the brain with\r\n  hæmorrhage.’ ‘The deceased’ added he, ‘lived alone; she was found\r\n  dead in her chamber, where she appeared to have fallen down.’ The\r\n  municipal authorities caused the interment to be adjourned, and\r\n  required a new examination of the body in the presence of the\r\n  Commissioner of Police, assisted by two doctors in medicine. The\r\n  result of the examination was, ‘that Madame the widow Danzelle had\r\n  fallen under the blows of an assassin; the corpse bore five recent\r\n  wounds in the neck, made with a cutting instrument, and the carotid\r\n  artery had been divided.’\r\n\r\n  “In the month of July, a child of Dame Revel, Rue de Seine Saint\r\n  Germain, died very suddenly. The authorities being informed that the\r\n  child had been the subject of much ill-treatment on the part of the\r\n  parents, ordered an inquiry and _une expertise medico-legale_. The\r\n  examination of the body showed that the rumours as to the barbarous\r\n  conduct of Dame Revel, the mother, were but too well-founded. Dr.\r\n  Olivier testified to the fact, that the body bore twenty-seven\r\n  recent contusions on the body and members, and a fracture of nearly\r\n  five inches in extent, which almost entirely broke through one of\r\n  the bones of the cranium.\r\n\r\n  “The death of this poor child, which was three years and three\r\n  months old, awakened suspicions which had arisen on the death of its\r\n  eldest brother, of eight years of age, which had been interred on\r\n  the 28th of February preceding. The body was disinterred, and Dr.\r\n  Olivier, to whom this second examination was confided,\r\n  notwithstanding the length of time that had occurred since the\r\n  death, found traces of numerous contusions on the body and members,\r\n  and a wound above the right ear, with a fracture and disjunction of\r\n  the bones of the cranium.”\r\n\r\nAnd notwithstanding in this, as in the other case, the interment was\r\neffected without observations.[28]\r\n\r\nAfter giving instances where the innocent were justified or suspicions\r\nwere allayed by post mortem examinations, which proved that deaths\r\nsuspected to have been from murder had occurred from natural causes, M.\r\nOrfila concludes by stating:—\r\n\r\n  “I do not believe that it often happens that persons are interred\r\n  alive in Paris, though I must admit that such events may take place;\r\n  but I am convinced that the earth has covered and continues to cover\r\n  crimes without any suspicion being raised in respect to them.”\r\n\r\n§ 138. Another report imputes the neglects of the “officiers de santé,”\r\nto the forgetfulness of duties, the force of habit or routine, the\r\nresults of age and infirmities; and the chief remedy recommended, and\r\nnow apparently in course of adoption in Paris, is the erection on the\r\nunsubstantial foundation of service by a number of private\r\npractitioners, of two additional stages as securities, namely, of three\r\npaid medical officers, who are to devote their time to the\r\nsuperintendence of the performance of the public duties by the private\r\npractitioners, and, secondly, a certain number of high honorary\r\nofficers, who are to superintend both classes of paid officers. This is\r\nan example of one of those superficial alterations, in which, from want\r\nof firmness on the part of the legislature to compensate fairly and\r\namply the interests which it is obviously necessary to disturb, and from\r\nnot duly regarding and estimating the immense amount of pain and public\r\nevil which requires measures of alleviation of corresponding extent and\r\nefficiency; consequently from allowing that amount of pain and mortality\r\nto weigh as dust against local patronage and latent sinister\r\ninterests,—that evil is only masked, and more widely and deeply spread\r\nby the intended remedy. Of a certainty the attention of every private\r\npractitioner, as he gains practice, whilst acting as a public officer,\r\nmust every hour of the day be _from_ his public duties, and _with_ the\r\nmeans of adding to his emoluments. That the least possible time may be\r\ntaken from them, the public duties are slurred over, conclusions are\r\nsnapped from the readiest superficial incidents; extensive and\r\nremovable, but latent causes of evil, the development of which would\r\nrequire sustained and laborious examination, are perpetuated, by being\r\nstamped authoritatively as “accidental” or arbitrarily classed under\r\nsome general term assigning the evils as the results of some inscrutable\r\ncause. The three superior paid inspectors will not long be able to\r\nstimulate the thirty-five private practitioners to a close attention to\r\ntheir public duties against their paramount and ever-pressing interests,\r\nor will soon tire of doing so. The service will become one of mere\r\nroutine and of short and easy acquiescence in all except the most\r\nextraordinary cases which present an appearance of danger to the officer\r\nhimself if he overlook them. Under such arrangements, the functions of\r\nthe office degenerates into a highly prejudicial form, protracting the\r\nevil, by creating an impression from the fact of the existence of the\r\noffice, that all has been done in the way of prevention or remedy that\r\ncan be done by such an officer. The admixture of private practice with\r\nimportant public duties in such cases, is attended with further evil in\r\ndepriving the public of much volunteer service from the whole class of\r\nprivate practitioners, for many who would give information to advance\r\nscience, or to aid the public service, can scarcely be expected to give\r\ncordial aid that may add to the credit and promote the interests of a\r\nrival. To the people themselves such services, from a locally connected\r\nprivate practitioner, are generally less acceptable than those of an\r\nindependent and responsible public officer. The official service must,\r\nin time, fail to inspire confidence, for it must fail to elicit evidence\r\nto justify public confidence. The additional expense of the three\r\nadditional officers will only have created an additional interest, in\r\nslurring over cases that may have been overlooked by the other class of\r\nofficers, involving blame for remissness to the superior officers. When\r\nexposures do take place, these two classes of officers will only add to\r\nthe means of perplexing public attention, and of dividing and weakening\r\nresponsibility. If less than half the number of officers, devoting their\r\nwhole time to the service, would be sufficient (as will be shown they\r\nwould), for the efficient discharge of these highly important duties in\r\nLondon, less than one-third of the number would suffice in Paris.\r\n\r\n§ 139. Except in the regulation of the expenses of the funerals, there\r\nappears to be nothing in the practice of interments in Paris, that\r\ndeserves to be considered with a view to imitation. Indeed, the whole\r\narrangements there are now under revision, and exertions are being made\r\nfor their improvement. The little account that appears to have been at\r\nany time made of the feelings of the labouring classes, and the burial\r\nafter dissection, of the poor dying in hospitals, without funereal\r\nrites, the almost total omission of any marks of sympathy or respect\r\ntowards their remains,—cannot but have a most demoralizing effect on the\r\nsurvivors. The mode in which the evil of the retention of the corpse\r\namidst the living is provided for by the law, which requires that\r\ninterments shall take place within twenty-four hours after notice, must\r\nfrequently oppress the feelings of the dying and of survivors, and\r\nharass them with alarms which the medical inspection provided, as we\r\nhave seen, § 137, is not of a character to allay. The intermediate stage\r\nof removal provided at Franckfort and other German towns; the retention\r\nof the corpse in a separate room warmed and ventilated, and watched at\r\nall hours, and lighted during the night; the regular medical attendance\r\nand inspection, and other cares bestowed until there are unequivocal\r\nsigns of dissolution, and the minds of all classes are satisfied,\r\nappears to be a superior arrangement, salutary in its effect and\r\nprinciple.[29] Beyond these benevolent arrangements may be commended the\r\nacts of real good will and charity by which the feelings of the\r\nlabouring classes are consulted and satisfied by community of sepulture,\r\nand the benevolent care and spirit of good will in which it appears to\r\nbe maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Experience in respect to the sites of Places of Burial, and sanitary\r\n               precautions necessary in respect to them._\r\n\r\nThere appear to be very important questions connected with the\r\nconsideration of the site of the place of burial to populous districts.\r\n\r\n§ 140. The question of the distance of places of burial (irrespective of\r\nconvenience of conveyance) appears to be dependent on the numbers\r\nburied,—on the composition and preparation of the ground,—on the\r\nelevation or depression of the place of burial,—and its exposure to the\r\natmosphere and the direction of the prevalent winds for the avoidance of\r\nhabitations.\r\n\r\n§ 141. The extent of burial ground requisite for any district will be\r\ndetermined by the rate of decomposition.\r\n\r\n§ 142. At Franckfort and Munich, and in the other new cemeteries on the\r\ncontinent, where qualified persons have paid attention to the subject,\r\nthe general rule is not to allow more than one body in a grave. The\r\ngrounds for this rule are,—that, when only one body is deposited in a\r\ngrave, the decomposition proceeds regularly,—the emanations are more\r\ndiluted and less noxious than when the mass of remains is greater; and\r\nalso that the inconvenience of opening the graves, of allowing escapes\r\nof miasma, and the indecency of disturbing the remains for new\r\ninterments, is thereby avoided; and in the case of exhumations, the\r\nconfusion and danger of mistaking the particular body is prevented.\r\n\r\n§ 143. The progress of the decay of the body is various, according to\r\nthe nature of the soil and the surrounding agencies. Clayey soils are\r\nantiseptic; they retain the gases, as explained by Mr. Leigh; they\r\nexclude the external atmosphere, and are also liable to the\r\ninconvenience of becoming deeply fissured in hot weather and then\r\nallowing the escape of the emanations which have been retained in a\r\nhighly concentrated state. Loamy, ferruginous, and aluminous soils, moor\r\nearth, and bog, are unfavourable to decomposition; sandy, marly, and\r\ncalcareous soils are favourable to it. Water, at a low temperature, has\r\nthe tendency, as already explained, to promote only a languid\r\ndecomposition, which sometimes produces adipocire in bodies: a high and\r\ndry temperature tends to produce the consistency and permanency of\r\nmummies. A temperature of from 65 degrees Fahrenheit and upwards, and a\r\nmoist atmosphere, is the most favourable to decomposition. The remains\r\nof the young decompose more rapidly than those of the old, females than\r\nmales, the fat than the lean. The remains of children decompose very\r\nrapidly. On opening the graves of children at a period of six or seven\r\nyears, the bodies have been found decomposed, not even the bones\r\nremaining, whilst the bodies of the adults were but little affected. The\r\nprocess of decomposition is also affected by the disease by which the\r\ndeath was occasioned. The process is delayed by the make of some sorts\r\nof coffins. The extreme variations of the process under such\r\ncircumstances as those above recited is from a few months to 30 years or\r\nhalf a century. Bones often last for centuries.\r\n\r\n§ 144. The regulation of the depth of the graves has been found to be a\r\nsubject requiring great attention, to avoid occasioning too rapid an\r\nevolution of miasma from the remains, and at the same time to avoid its\r\nretention and corruption, to avoid the pollution of distant springs, and\r\nalso to avoid rendering increased space for burial requisite by the\r\ndelay of decomposition usually produced by deep burial, for the ground\r\nusually becomes hard in proportion to the depth, and delays the\r\ndecomposition. Attention to these circumstances by qualified persons in\r\nGermany has led to different regulations of the depth of graves at\r\ndifferent ages. At Stuttgart the different depths are as follows: for\r\nbodies of persons—\r\n\r\n                                        ft. in.\r\n                         Under 8 years    3   9\r\n                         8 to 10 years    4   7\r\n                         10 to 14 years   5   7\r\n                         Adults           6   7\r\n\r\nAt the Glasshutte, in the Erzgebirge, the depths are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                       ft. in.\r\n                         Under 8 years   3   8\r\n                         8 to 14 years   4   7\r\n                         Adults          5   0\r\n\r\nAt Franckfort the average depth prescribed for graves is 5 ft. 7 in.; at\r\nMunich 6 ft. 7 in.; in France 4 ft. 10 in. to 6 ft.; in Austria 6 ft. 2\r\nin., if lime be used.\r\n\r\n§ 145. Space between graves is also a matter requiring attention to\r\navoid the uncovering of the coffin in one grave in opening another, and\r\nto avoid the accidents arising from the falling in of the sides of the\r\ngraves: this space must vary according to the consistency of the ground\r\nand the depth of the graves. At Munich and Stuttgart the space\r\nprescribed, is in round numbers, rather more than 32 square feet to each\r\nadult. To avoid treading on the graves, and to allow the access of\r\nfriends, spaces must be allowed also for walks.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances considered, the space requisite for the interments\r\nin a town may be determined by the multiplication of the average square\r\nsuperficies of a grave, by the average yearly mortality, and the period\r\nof years which the grave is to remain closed. “As an example,” says Dr.\r\nReicke, “of the mode of calculating the necessary space for the burial\r\nground of a populous district, I will take a town of 35,000 inhabitants.\r\nAccordingly of this number it may be reckoned there will yearly die\r\n1000. Of the number 500 will be adults, 50 children, from 7 to 14, and\r\n450 children from 0 to 7 years. For the adults, allowing more than the\r\nmost economical space, I calculate graves of 48 square feet Wirtemburg\r\n(_i. e._ 54·72 square feet English); for the children between 7 and 14\r\nyears, 24 square feet (27·36 English feet); and for those under 7, 20\r\nsquare feet (22·80 English). For the adults I take a period of 10 years,\r\nfor the youth 8 years, for the infants 7 years, as the time during which\r\nperiods the grave must not be opened.” According to this calculation the\r\nspace required for the interment of the several classes would be—\r\n\r\n                        English   Numbers            English\r\n                        Square     Dead.

As an example of a\r\ntown population, in Whitechapel the proportion of deaths for every\r\n35,000 of the population will be 1125 deaths yearly. As an example of a\r\nrural population, for every 35,000 of the population in Hereford, there\r\nwill only be 562 deaths annually, and the space required for interments\r\nfor the two populations will be as follows, at the actual rate of deaths\r\nper 35,000 amongst the population in the Whitechapel Union in 1839:\r\n\r\n                  English                              Total    Average\r\n                  Square     Number of    Age of      Area in   Square\r\n                   Feet.

The average size of the different graves may be taken as an\r\nepitome of the strength of the same numbers of the two populations: that\r\nof the town grave being in round numbers 39 feet, while the rural grave\r\nis 44 feet.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the extent of land requisite for cemetery, on a decennial\r\nperiod of renewal, for a population of 20,000 in a rural district would\r\nbe only 4–4/10 acres, whilst for 20,000 of such a town population as\r\nthat of Whitechapel, it would be 7–4/10 acres.\r\n\r\n§ 146. In 1838 the deaths in the metropolis were nearly 52,000; and for\r\nround numbers the average maybe taken as 50,000 annually. Such an amount\r\nof mortality would require on the scale proposed by Dr. Riecke, for the\r\nseveral classes of graves, about 48 acres, or a space of nearly the size\r\nof St. James’s Park within the rails, annually. On the same scale,\r\nsupposing the interments generally renewable in decennial periods, the\r\nspace required for national cemeteries in the metropolis would be 444\r\nacres, or a space coextensive with Hyde Park, which has 350 acres, and\r\nthe Green Park and St. James’s Park put together; or rather more than\r\none-fourth more than the Regent’s Park, which has 350 acres; or\r\none-fourth less space than the Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens taken\r\ntogether. But besides the spaces for the cemeteries, spaces would be\r\nrequisite as belts of land surrounding them, and to be kept clear of\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n§ 147. The proper distance of places of interment from houses, is\r\ncalculable according to the number of interments. On this subject there\r\nhave been some, though not complete observations. There is a church-yard\r\nat Stuttgart, in which 500 bodies are interred yearly, at depths varying\r\nwith the age, according to the scale of regulations stated, with no more\r\nthan one corpse in each grave, yet a north-west wind renders the\r\nemanations from the ground perceptible in houses distant from 250 to 300\r\npaces. The stench of the carrion pits at Montfaucon is almost\r\ninsupportable to a person not used to it, at a distance of 6500 feet,\r\nand with certain winds at double that distance, and under some\r\ncircumstances even to the distance of five miles. Besides the surface\r\nemanations, the pollution of the subsoil drainage and springs have to be\r\nregarded. Captain Vetch states, that on some plains in Mexico, where\r\nanimals have been slaughtered and buried in pits in permeable ground,\r\nthe effects on vegetation were to be seen along the edges of a brook for\r\na distance of three-quarters of a mile. In some parts they actually\r\nslaughtered and buried animals for the purpose of influencing the\r\nsurrounding vegetation. By the best regulations in Germany, as already\r\nstated, wells are forbidden to be sunk near grave-yards, except at\r\ncertain distances, such as 300 feet. _Ante_, §§ 13, 14.\r\n\r\n§ 148. On such data as have been obtained, the distance of a cemetery\r\nought to vary according to its size, or the number of the population for\r\nwhom burial is required. The cemetery for a small population of from 500\r\nto 1000 inhabitants, should, Dr. Reicke considers, be not less than 150\r\npaces; for 1000 to 5000 inhabitants, not less than 300 paces; for above\r\n5000, not less than 500 paces. In Prussia, the distance from houses at\r\nwhich cemeteries may be built, is fixed at not less than 500 paces; at\r\nStralsund, in Prussia, at 1000 paces.\r\n\r\n§ 149. It is recommended that in general public cemeteries should be\r\nplaced at the east or the north, or the north-east of a town: the south\r\nand south-west winds, being usually moist, hold the putrefactive gases\r\nin solution more readily than the north, or north-east winds, which are\r\ndry. The higher the elevation of a cemetery, the nearer may it be\r\npermitted to a city, as putrefactive gases are lighter than the\r\natmosphere and ascend. For the same reason, cemeteries lower than the\r\nhouses should be at a greater distance. A site, with a slope to the\r\nsouth, is deemed the best, as it will be drier and warmer, and\r\nfacilitate decomposition.\r\n\r\n§ 150. Competent witnesses declare, that by a careful preparation of the\r\nground, and without any appliances that would be otherwise than\r\nacceptable to the most fastidious minds, the escape of miasma may be so\r\nregulated as to avoid all injury to the health, and springs may be\r\nprotected from pollution by drainage; and that by these means the\r\nnecessity of far distant sites, and the inconvenience and expense of\r\nconveyance of the remains, and obstructions to the access of friends to\r\nthe place of burial, may be avoided.\r\n\r\n§ 151. Amongst these means, one for preventing the escape of emanations\r\nat the surface by absorbing and purifying them, is entirely in\r\naccordance with the popular feeling. The great body of English poetry,\r\nwhich it has been remarked is more rich on the subject of sepulture than\r\nthe poetry of any other nation, abounds with reference to the practice\r\nof ornamenting graves with flowers, shrubs, and trees. A rich vegetation\r\nexercises a powerful purifying influence, and where the emanations are\r\nmoderate, as from single graves, would go far to prevent the escape of\r\nany deleterious miasma. It is conceived that the escapes of large\r\nquantities of deleterious gasses by the fissuring of the ground would\r\noften be in a very great degree prevented by turfing over the surface,\r\nor by soiling, that is, by laying vegetable mould of five or six inches\r\nin thickness and sowing it carefully with grasses whose roots spread and\r\nmesh together. At the Abney Park Cemetery, where the most successful\r\nattention is paid to the vegetation, this is done; but in some districts\r\nof towns it marks the impurity of the common atmosphere that even grass\r\nwill not thrive; and that flowers and shrubs which live on the river\r\nside, or in spaces open to the breeze, become weakly and die rapidly in\r\nthe enclosed spaces in the crowded districts. Several species of\r\nevergreens, and the plants which have gummy or resinous leaves, that are\r\napt to retain soot or dust, die quickly. The influence, therefore, of a\r\nfull variety of flowers and a rich vegetation, so necessary for the\r\nactual purification of the atmosphere, as well as to remove associations\r\nof impurity, and refresh the eye and soothe the mind, can only be\r\nobtained at a distance from most towns. It occasionally happens that\r\nindividuals incur expense to decorate graves in the town churchyards\r\nwith flowers, and more would do so, even in the churchyards near\r\nthoroughfares, but that they perish.\r\n\r\n§ 152. Mr. Loudon recommends for planting in cemeteries, trees chiefly\r\nof the fastigiate growing kinds, which neither cover a large space with\r\ntheir branches nor give too much shade when the sun shines, and which\r\nadmit light and air to neutralize any mephitic effluvia. Of these are,\r\nthe Oriental Arbor Vitæ, the Evergreen Cypress, the Swedish and Irish\r\nJuniper, &c. For the same reason, trees of the narrow conical forms,\r\nsuch as the Red Cedar, and various pines and firs are desirable. In\r\nadvantageously situated cemeteries, some of the larger trees, such as\r\nthe Cedar of Lebanon, the Oriental Plane, the Purple Beech, the dark\r\nYew, and the flowering Ash, sycamores, Mountain Ash, hollies, thorns,\r\nand some species of oaks, such as the Evergreen Oak, the Italian Oak,\r\nwith flowering trees and shrubs, would find places in due proportion.\r\n\r\n§ 153. There is one point of view in which the site of cemeteries does\r\nnot appear to have been considered on the continent, and perhaps in no\r\nplace could it be of so much importance as in London, namely, the\r\nconvenience of access for processions, including in the consideration\r\nthe protection of the inhabitants of particular quarters from an excess\r\nof funereal processions, and the mourners from the conflicting\r\nimpressions consequent on a passage through thoroughfares crowded by a\r\npopulation unavoidably inattentive. It might be found on a survey that\r\nthe banks of the river present several eligible sites for national\r\ncemeteries, and one pre-eminent recommendation of such sites would be\r\nthe superior and economical means of conveyance they would afford by\r\nappropriate funereal barges, for uninterrupted and noiseless passage\r\nover what has been denominated “The Great Silent Highway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Extent of Burial Grounds existing in the Metropolis._\r\n\r\n§ 154. The rule, as deduced (§ 142.) from the German practice, would\r\ngive an average of 110 burials per acre per annum in a town district.\r\n\r\n§ 155. In 1834, some returns of the extent of burial grounds and the\r\nnumber of burials during the three years preceding, in the places of\r\nburial within the diocese of the Bishop of London and the bills of\r\nmortality, were laid before the House of Commons. From those it appeared\r\nthat the ground occupied as burial ground within the diocese amounted to\r\n103 acres, and that the average number of burials was 22,548, or 219 per\r\nacre, being from 108 to 117 more per acre than the preceding rule would\r\ngive. In some grounds the number of interments were as high as 891 per\r\nacre. But that return did not include the burials in the whole of the\r\nmetropolis. From the results of a systematic inquiry which has been\r\nrecently made throughout the whole district of the metropolis (as\r\ndefined in the report of the Registrar-General) into the extent of the\r\nburial-grounds and the average weekly number of burials at each place,\r\nit appears that the total area now occupied as burial ground, including\r\nthe new cemeteries, and the annual rate of burial in each class, is, as\r\nnearly as can be ascertained, as follows:—\r\n\r\n ────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n                 │          │  Annual  │ Average  │ Highest  │  Lowest\r\n  Burial Grounds │          │Number of │  Annual  │Number of │Number of\r\n      in the     │ Area in  │ Burials, │Number of │ Burials  │ Burials\r\n   Metropolis.   │  Acres.  │exclusive │ Burials  │ per Acre │ per Acre\r\n                 │          │ of Vault │per Acre. │  in any  │  in any\r\n                 │          │ Burials. │          │ Ground.  │ Ground.\r\n ────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n Parochial       │  176–3/10│    33,747│       191│     3,073│        11\r\n   Grounds       │          │          │          │          │\r\n Protestant      │          │          │          │          │\r\n   Dissenters’   │    8–7/10│     1,715│       197│     1,210│         6\r\n   Grounds       │          │          │          │          │\r\n Roman Catholics │    0–3/10│       270│     1,043│     1,613│       814\r\n Jews            │    9–2/10│       304│        33│        52│        13\r\n Swedish Chapel  │    0–1/10│        10│       108│          │\r\n Undescribed     │   10–9/10│     3,197│       294│     1,109│         5\r\n Private Grounds │   12–6/10│     5,112│       405│     2,323│        50\r\n ────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n   Total of      │          │          │          │          │\r\n   Intra-mural   │  218–1/10│    44,355│       203│     1,080│        46\r\n   Grounds       │          │          │          │          │\r\n ────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n   Total of New  │  260–5/10│     3,336│        13│       155│         4\r\n   Cemeteries    │          │          │          │          │\r\n   Vault Burials │          │       789│          │          │\r\n ────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\nThe total numbers of burials, as ascertained by verbal inquiry at each\r\ngraveyard, approximate so nearly to the total numbers of deaths as to\r\nafford a presumption in favour of the general accuracy of these\r\nreturns.[30]\r\n\r\n§ 156. The most crowded burial grounds, on the average, are, it appears,\r\nthe grounds which belong to private individuals, usually undertakers. In\r\nthese places an uneducated man generally acts as minister, puts on a\r\nsurplice, and reads the church service, or any other service that may be\r\ncalled for. These grounds are morally offensive, and appear to be\r\nphysically dangerous in proportion to the numbers interred in them. In\r\none of them the numbers interred appears to be at the rate of more than\r\n2,300 per acre per annum. Names are given to these places by the owners,\r\nimporting connexion with congregations, but without any apparent\r\nauthority for doing so. They are repudiated by the most respectable\r\nDissenters. On this point it appears to be just to submit an extract\r\nfrom a communication (on his individual responsibility) from the Rev.\r\nJohn Blackburn, Pentonville, one of the secretaries of the Union of\r\nCongregational Dissenters:—\r\n\r\n  I have no facts to communicate relating to the _physical_ effects\r\n  produced by the present crowded state of the old grave-yards, but I\r\n  am sure the moral sensibilities of many delicate minds must sicken\r\n  to witness the heaped soil, saturated and blackened with human\r\n  remains and fragments of the dead, exposed to the rude insults of\r\n  ignorant and brutal spectators. Immediately connected with this,\r\n  allow me to mention that some spots that have been chosen both by\r\n  episcopalians and dissenters, are wet and clayey, so that the splash\r\n  of water is heard from the graves, as the coffins descend, producing\r\n  a shudder in every mourner. I may with confidence disclaim the\r\n  imputation that the grave-yards of dissenters were primarily and\r\n  chiefly established with a view to emolument. Many grave-yards that\r\n  are private property, purchased by undertakers for their own\r\n  emolument, are regarded as dissenting burial grounds, and we are\r\n  implicated in the censures that are pronounced upon the unseemly and\r\n  disgusting transactions that have been detected in them.—These are\r\n  not dissenting but general cemeteries: dissenters use them for the\r\n  reasons already stated [which are omitted, being the objections\r\n  urged by dissenters against the indiscriminate use of the burial\r\n  service.] The pastor of the bereaved family accompanies them to the\r\n  grave, or meets them there, adapts his ministrations to their known\r\n  circumstances, and without fee or reward—except in rare\r\n  cases—discharges them as part of his pastoral work. By far the\r\n  greatest portion of the persons buried in these grounds are not\r\n  dissenters at all; and to meet the feelings of their connections the\r\n  proprietors of these grounds obtain the services of men, who,\r\n  without scruple, ape the clergyman, assume the surplice, and read\r\n  the service of the church; a fact which is sufficient to show that\r\n  they are not dissenters themselves, nor seeking to conciliate\r\n  dissenting objections. The congregational or independent\r\n  denomination, to which I belong, have about 120 chapels in and\r\n  around London, and I believe there is not more than a sixth part of\r\n  them that have grave yards attached, and all those are not in the\r\n  hands of trustees appointed by the people. But, as far as I know and\r\n  believe, there are but very few of these open to the sweeping\r\n  censures that have been pronounced upon them. At a recent meeting of\r\n  the congregational ministers of the metropolis they resolved, “That\r\n  this board will always hail with satisfaction the adoption of any\r\n  efficient means to correct abuses connected with burial grounds, as\r\n  well general as parochial, where such abuses are proved to exist;”\r\n  and I trust that the character of dissenters in general for good\r\n  citizenship, is sufficient to assure you that they will never permit\r\n  their private interests to oppose any great measures for our social\r\n  improvement that are really national in their spirit and design.\r\n\r\nAs the sufficiency of the burial grounds existing within the metropolis\r\ndoes not properly come into question under the general conclusion that\r\nthere ought to be none there, the only observation I at present submit\r\nupon the space of ground now occupied is that it would serve hereafter\r\nadvantageously to be kept open as public ground.\r\n\r\n§ 157. The well considered regulations then, give about 1452 common\r\ngraves per acre for a town population. § 145. In the arrangements made\r\nfor cemeteries belonging to a joint stock company, it is calculated that\r\nevery acre of ground filled with vaults and private graves, will receive\r\nno less than 11,000 bodies. On the average size of coffins of 6 feet 3\r\nby 1 foot 9, the common estimate is that the floor of an acre will\r\nreceive 3,887 coffins laid side by side.\r\n\r\n§ 158. Another calculation for the produce of a company’s cemetery, is\r\nthat each grave will be 6 feet by 2 feet, or 12 square feet, or 3630\r\ngraves to the acre (which contains 43,560 square feet), and that every\r\ngrave shall contain 10 coffins in each grave. Twenty-five shillings is\r\ncharged for each coffin interred: hence each acre is calculated to\r\nproduce, when filled (without reference to the public health), a gross\r\nsum of 45,375_l._ In one instance, where the burials in a company’s\r\ncemetery were five deep, the sales of graves actually made were at a\r\nrate of 17,000_l._ per acre, gross produce.\r\n\r\n§ 159. The retention of bodies in leaden coffins in vaults is objected\r\nto, as increasing the noxiousness of the gases, which sooner or later\r\nescape, and when in vaults beneath churches, create a miasma which is\r\napt to escape through the floor, whenever the church is warmed.[31] In\r\nAustria, and in other states, interment in lead is prohibited. In the\r\nmajority of cases in England, burial in lead, as well as in other\r\nexpensive coffins, appears to be generally promoted by the undertakers,\r\nto whom they are the most profitable. The Emperor Joseph, of Austria, on\r\nthe knowledge of the more deleterious character of concentrated\r\nemanations from the dead, forbade the use even of coffins, and directed\r\nthat all people should be buried in sacks; but this excited discontent\r\namongst his subjects, who agreed in the sanitary principle of the\r\nmeasure, but complained that, putting them in sacks, was treating them\r\nas the Turks would do, and the regulation was altered for burial in\r\ncoffins made of pine, which decays rapidly.\r\n\r\n§ 160. It is to be observed as an improved direction of the public mind\r\nin the British metropolis, that on the part of persons who have the\r\nmeans of defraying the expenses of vaults, an increasing preference of\r\ninhumation is manifested, and that it is found by cemetery companies\r\nthat catacombs prepared for sale are not so much in demand as was\r\nanticipated from the proportion in which they were in demand in the\r\nparochial burial grounds. The state of some of the places of common\r\nburial has evidently been such as to lead to the practice of entombment\r\nin preference to inhumation. The associations commonly expressed with\r\ninhumation (_redditur enim terræ corpus, et ita locatum ac situm, quasi\r\noperimento matris obducitur_, Cic. de legibus) were with a purer earth.\r\nIn the most carefully regulated cemeteries in Germany the sale of any\r\nportions in perpetuity is entirely prohibited. The recent investigation\r\nof the disorders which have arisen in the management of the Parisian\r\ncemeteries, has led to a conclusion for the adoption of the same\r\nregulation, it having been found that, in time, families become extinct,\r\nor fall into decay; that a proportion of the tombs and vaults are\r\nneglected and fall into ruins, and detract from the general good keeping\r\nof the rest. Under such circumstances the private tombs too frequently\r\nraise associations of a character the very opposite of those intended by\r\nthe purchasers. Their numbers at the same time increase and continually\r\nencroach on the spaces for general burial, and would ultimately occupy\r\nthe whole of the cemeteries; and in the progress of population would\r\nabsorb and hold large tracts of most important land near towns, in what\r\nwould literally be one of the worst species of mortmain.[32] It has,\r\ntherefore, been found necessary to restrict the sale of perpetuities in\r\nvaults or graves, and to give only what may be called leases for years,\r\nrenewable on conditions, for the public protection.\r\n\r\n§ 161. In the common grave-yards in the metropolis, the bones are\r\nscattered about, or wheeled away to a bone-house, where they are thrown\r\ninto a heap. The feeling of the labouring classes at the sight of the\r\nremoval of the bones from an overcrowded churchyard was expressed in a\r\nrecent complaint, that those in charge of the place “would not give the\r\npoor bones time to decay.” In Paris it is the custom to arrange skulls\r\nand bones, in various forms, in catacombs: but they are offensive\r\nobjects; and the feelings of the poor man must be but ill consulted in\r\npresenting to him, in these decayed and debased remains, the prospect of\r\nthe use of his own skull and bones to form part of a great and revolting\r\nmonument. A more beneficial arrangement is that in the better regulated\r\nGerman cemeteries, where it is the invariable rule to remove from the\r\nsight and to re-inter carefully, all bones, the object being to preserve\r\nthe associations of a gradual, inoffensive, and salutary restoration of\r\nthe material elements.\r\n\r\n§ 162. By the Code Napoleon any one was permitted to be interred in his\r\nown garden, or wheresoever he pleased. By the better considered\r\njurisprudence in Germany this liberty is withheld: because if the\r\npractice were to become general, such decomposing remains would be\r\nspread about without order, to the injury of the public health: it would\r\nfacilitate the burial of persons murdered; many by precipitate and\r\nill-regulated burial would be buried alive; many would be buried in this\r\nmode to evade proper inquiries. An examination of the circumstances of\r\nprivate and speculative burial grounds in this country developes many\r\nfacts, in corroboration of the soundness of the German jurisprudence on\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\n§ 163. The information with relation to material arrangements of the\r\npublic cemeteries in Germany is submitted, as showing how much there is\r\nin their details of important questions of scientific appliances for\r\nconsideration, which, in the new cemeteries as well as in the old burial\r\ngrounds in this country, have generally been overlooked: appliances\r\nwhich, even if they were practicable on a parochial scale of management,\r\nwould surely be little understood by the ordinary class of parochial\r\nofficers. Though the practice in Germany appears to be on most points in\r\nadvance, the inquiry has elicited various suggestions of probable\r\nimportant improvements upon it, which it is thought unnecessary to\r\ndiscuss, as being more fitted for investigation when new cemeteries have\r\nbeen determined upon than at present. It may for the present suffice to\r\nstate, that a confident expectation is entertained by the best informed\r\nwitnesses, that were the attention of the most competent persons who\r\nhave hitherto been scared away, secured to the subject, still further\r\nuseful improvements would be in a very short time effected.\r\n\r\n§ 164. The following portion of evidence from Dr. Lyon Playfair, which\r\nadverts to the management of the evil in the common grave-yards, may\r\nhowever be adduced as an example of the character of some of the\r\nimprovements already suggested.\r\n\r\n  You have examined into the state of certain church-yards with\r\n  reference to their sanitary effects; have you not?—I have examined\r\n  various church-yards and burying-grounds for the purpose of\r\n  ascertaining whether the layer of earth above the bodies is\r\n  sufficient to absorb the putrid gases evolved. The carbonic acid gas\r\n  would not in any case be absorbed, but it is not to this that the\r\n  evil effects are to be attributed. The slightest inspection,\r\n  however, shows that the putrid gases are not thoroughly absorbed by\r\n  soil lying over the bodies. I know several church-yards from which\r\n  most fœtid smells are evolved, and gases with similar odour are\r\n  emitted from the sides of sewers passing in the vicinity of\r\n  church-yards, although they may be above 30 feet from them. If these\r\n  gases are thus evolved laterally they must be equally emitted in an\r\n  upward direction. The worst burying-grounds which have come under my\r\n  notice are those belonging to private persons, generally\r\n  undertakers, who make their livelihood by interring at a cheap rate.\r\n  I visited one of these only a few days since. It was about 150 feet\r\n  long and about 30 broad, and had been used for 80 years as a burying\r\n  ground, and was still a favourite place of interment among the poor.\r\n  Of course many bodies are placed in one grave, and when the ground\r\n  becomes too much raised by bodies, it is levelled, and the boxes,\r\n  &c., exhumed during the levelling, are thrown into a large cellar\r\n  fitted to receive them. This whole ground was a mass of corruption,\r\n  as may well be supposed, and it is situated in a densely populated\r\n  neighbourhood. I mention this case as one among many other similar\r\n  cases of private burying-grounds, in order to suggest that attention\r\n  should be paid in any alteration respecting the laws regulating\r\n  interments, to prevent burying-grounds being kept as objects of\r\n  pecuniary speculation, at least within towns; for this practice\r\n  gives much inducement to violate every feeling of decency and regard\r\n  for public health in the desire for gain.\r\n\r\n  Can you suggest any method for preventing the escape of miasmata\r\n  from graves, or from places for the interment of the dead?—I cannot\r\n  suggest any methods as the results of experiment; but, at the same\r\n  time, I think it possible that the evil might be much abated by the\r\n  use of certain materials. For example, in a theoretical point of\r\n  view, chloride of lime would be quite effectual, but it might not be\r\n  applicable in practice, both from its expense, and from its great\r\n  tendency to be decomposed. A cheap method of absorbing putrid\r\n  effluvia, is by a mixture of charcoal from burnt tar, burnt clay,\r\n  and gypsum. When such a mixture is mixed with putrid matter, all\r\n  smell is immediately removed, and the matter is rendered inoffensive\r\n  to health. When this mixture is strewed over decomposing animal and\r\n  vegetable matter, it ceases to emit disagreeable odours. In like\r\n  manner, if a layer of such a cheap mixture as this were thrown\r\n  around and over a coffin, it would absorb probably the greatest\r\n  part, if not all, of the putrid miasmata arising from the\r\n  decomposition of the body. It possesses also this advantage, that it\r\n  would not impair by keeping, even though the coffin did not burst\r\n  for some years. I beg, however, again to state, that I throw this\r\n  out as a mere suggestion, as I have never tried it in the case of\r\n  graves, although I think it would be well worthy of a trial.\r\n  Vegetation also ought to be encouraged over the graves. The\r\n  legitimate food of plants is derived from decaying animal matter;\r\n  for indeed all the food existing in the air, from which they derive\r\n  their nutriment, is furnished to the atmosphere by the decay of\r\n  organic matter. Plants assist in absorbing the emanations which\r\n  escape from graves.\r\n\r\n§ 165. It has been mentioned as an objection entertained in Germany to\r\nthe use of clayey soils, on the ground that they retain the gases, and\r\nprevent that regular access of air which is necessary (as explained in a\r\nportion of evidence already adduced) to allow decay to proceed without\r\nputrefaction, which is the most dangerous condition. Good sand and good\r\ngravel are of value in the metropolis. It is stated by a gentleman\r\nconnected with one of the cemeteries, and it is here mentioned to show\r\nthe prevalent want of knowledge, that it is the common practice when\r\nsand and gravel are dug out to form a grave, not to return it, but to\r\nfill in with the cheap and coarse, but retentive, London clay. Now the\r\ngrave-diggers frequently suffer severely in re-opening the graves which\r\nare thus filled in by the retentive clay, and require to be stimulated\r\nto their work by ardent spirits; and their ghastly appearance, as Mr.\r\nLoudon observes, attests the sufferings which they undergo. In another\r\nnew cemetery, where the grass was very poor, the turf-mounds covering\r\nsome of the graves was trodden down; on inquiring the reason, it was\r\nstated that sheep had been let in to eat the grass, to save the expense\r\nof cutting it. Some of the trees and shrubs first planted had not\r\nthriven well, and the officers stated that they had not yet been able to\r\npersuade the directors to go to the expense of renewing them. In most\r\nother cemeteries the plantations were in very good order, and several\r\npresented points of improvement, in the architectural arrangements. But,\r\nas observed by Mr. Loudon, “nearly all the new London cemeteries, and\r\nmost of the provincial cemeteries, adopt the practice of interring a\r\nnumber of bodies in the same grave, without leaving a sufficient depth\r\nover each coffin, to absorb the greater part of the gases of\r\ndecomposition.” It may indeed be confidently affirmed that there is\r\nscarcely one of the new cemeteries in which one or other of the well\r\nestablished principles of management, in the choice of the site, or the\r\npreparation of the soil, or in the drainage, or in the mode of burial,\r\nor in the numbers interred in one grave, or in respect to the\r\nprecautions to prevent the undue corruption of the remains and escapes\r\nof dangerous morbific matter, or in the service and officers, or in\r\njurisprudential securities, is not overlooked. (§ 20.)\r\n\r\n§ 166. In the cemetery at Liverpool, where Mr. Huskisson is interred, it\r\nis the practice to pile the coffins of the poorest class in deep graves\r\nor pits, one coffin over the other, with only a thin covering of earth\r\nover each coffin until the pit is filled, when it holds upwards of\r\nthirty, as the sexton expressed it, about “thirty-four big and little.”\r\nThe observation of several of the joint stock cemeteries, and their\r\nestimates of future amounts of interments, not of one body in one grave,\r\nbut of bodies piled one over the other by five and even ten deep,\r\nwithout any new precautions in respect to the emanations, the general\r\nexperience of the difficulty of effecting any change through commercial\r\nassociations that does not promise an immediate return for the expense\r\nincurred, prove that, although they may be kept in a better condition to\r\nthe eye, there is no security that they will not be as injurious as any\r\ncommon burial grounds, and stand as much in need of some regulations for\r\nthe protection of the inhabitants of the dwellings which in time may be\r\ndriven closer around them.\r\n\r\n§ 167. Besides the improvements in formation of the cemeteries and\r\nmanagement of the interments, the regulations of the Franckfort and\r\nMunich cemeteries present instances which it may here be proper to\r\nsubmit for consideration, of the advantages derivable in aid of the\r\nreligious service from a better organized staff of officers in\r\nmaintaining superior order in the grounds on all occasions of solemnity.\r\n\r\n§ 168. It will have been perceived how little support the clergymen have\r\nin any appointed staff of officers to maintain order in the\r\nburial-grounds of the more populous parishes. §§ 87, 88, and 111. On\r\noccasions of several interments taking place in burial-grounds in the\r\nmetropolis at the same time, the master undertakers will volunteer their\r\nservices to get the crowd of by-standers into some order, and show how\r\nmuch might be done by other and better superintendence to add to the\r\nimpressiveness of the last scene. The inferior attendants, the\r\ngrave-diggers, at the interments which I have witnessed at the new\r\ncemeteries, attended, as they usually do at the parochial grounds, in a\r\ndisorderly condition—unshaven, dirty in person, in dirty shirts and in\r\nthe old and the common filthy dress. During the burial service the\r\nundertakers’ men only concerned themselves in removing the feathers from\r\nthe hearse and preparing for an immediate return; all the attendants\r\nbegan talking on other matters, and went their different ways\r\nimmediately the coffin was lowered; the mourners were left with the\r\nutmost unconcern, except by the grave-diggers, who followed them in the\r\nattitude of the usual solicitations of money for drink.\r\n\r\n§ 169. A conception of the alterations required and practicable in\r\npublic establishments for conducting such a ceremony with due regard to\r\nthe feelings of the survivors and the public, may be formed by\r\ninspecting the regulations of the cemetery at Franckfort, from which it\r\nwill be perceived that the superintendence of the cemetery, and of the\r\nsextons in their various employments, is given to a cemetery inspector,\r\nwhose duties are described in the second section of the regulations, and\r\nwho must be a person of medical education, an officer of public health,\r\nexamined by the Sanitary Board, and found by them to be qualified. It is\r\nspecified as an important duty that he shall be present at the\r\ninterment, “in order that by his presence nothing may be done by his\r\nsubordinates, or by any other person, which should be contrary to the\r\ndignity of the interment or to the regulations.”\r\n\r\nThe regulations also provide as follows:—\r\n\r\n  (3.) For the performance of all the necessary arrangements preceding\r\n  the interment, commissaries of interments are appointed to take the\r\n  place of the so called undertakers. These commissaries have to\r\n  arrange every thing connected with the funeral, and are responsible\r\n  for the proper fulfilment of all the regulations given in their\r\n  instructions.\r\n\r\n  (4.) In order to prevent the great expense which was formerly\r\n  occasioned by the attendance with the dead to the grave, bearers\r\n  shall be appointed who shall attend to the cemetery all funerals,\r\n  without distinction of rank or condition.\r\n\r\n  To these bearers shall be given assistants, who shall be equally\r\n  under the control of the interment commissaries.\r\n\r\n  The commissary must see that the bearers are always cleanly and\r\n  respectably dressed in black when they appear at a funeral, and must\r\n  be particularly careful that they conduct themselves seriously,\r\n  quietly, and respectably.\r\n\r\n  He must also see that the carriage of the dead is not driven quickly\r\n  either in the town or beyond it, but that it is conducted\r\n  respectably at a proper quiet pace.\r\n\r\n  When the dead is covered, and not until then, the commissary and the\r\n  bearers shall leave the cemetery in perfect silence.\r\n\r\n  For any impropriety which may, through the conduct of the bearers,\r\n  arise during the interment, the commissary is responsible.\r\n\r\n  (35.) The sextons must always be respectably dressed in black during\r\n  the interment, and those who go to the house of mourning must always\r\n  appear in neat and clean attire, and must be studious at all times,\r\n  whether engaged within or without the churchyard, to preserve a\r\n  modest and proper behaviour. Drunkenness, neglect of duty, or abuse\r\n  of their services, will be punished by the Church Yard Commission,\r\n  and on repetition of the offence, the offender will be dismissed.\r\n\r\nA Christian attention and civility to all is required from the highest\r\npublic officer, without any fees or expense, and mendicancy on the part\r\nof the inferior attendants, and the rapacity of the uneducated and of\r\nthe ill-educated, which always rushes in most strongly on the helpless,\r\nare equally prohibited. Of the inspector himself, it is by these\r\nregulations provided:—\r\n\r\n  (17.) It is the duty of the inspector to treat all who have to apply\r\n  to him with politeness and respect, and to give the required\r\n  information unweariedly and with ready good will.\r\n\r\n  Under no pretext is he allowed either to demand or receive any\r\n  payment, as he has a sufficient salary.\r\n\r\nAnd in respect to the other officers:—\r\n\r\n  (40.) Besides, or in addition to the authorised payment printed in\r\n  the tax roll, and determined by the Cemetery Commission as the\r\n  sufficient remuneration of the Inspector, Commissioners of\r\n  Interments, the bearers and sextons, no one is on the occasion of a\r\n  death, either to give money, or to furnish food and drink.\r\n\r\n  The practice of furnishing crape, gloves, lemons, &c., by the\r\n  friends of the dead, is also given up, and the persons engaged in\r\n  conducting the interment, must take all the requisites with them,\r\n  without asking or receiving any compensation, under pain of instant\r\n  dismissal.\r\n\r\n§ 170. It is now a prevalent complaint, which, so far as the present\r\ninquiry has proceeded, appears to be a just one, that in the management\r\nof the common grave-yards in this country, human remains are literally\r\ntreated as earth, by the sextons and gravediggers, and ignorant men to\r\nwhom that management falls. The popular sentiments are offended by such\r\nopen practices as that of using an iron borer, to bore down and\r\nascertain whether the ground is occupied by a coffin, and whether it and\r\nthe contents are sufficiently decayed for removal. Were proper\r\nregistries kept of all interments and their sites, these, and a\r\nknowledge of natural operations, would render such offensive processes\r\nunnecessary. There appear to be few parochial grounds in which the\r\nremains of any individual of the poorer classes could be found with\r\ncertainty, for exhumation, or for judicial or other purposes.\r\n\r\n§ 171. In the German regulations cited as examples, the public feeling\r\nis carefully consulted, and the general principle is acted upon, that\r\nthe remains, so long as they last, are sacred, and must even be dealt\r\nwith as sentient. Year after year the regulations for the care of the\r\ndead in the house of reception preparatory to interment are scrupulously\r\nmaintained, on the presumption that a revival may take place, and the\r\naction upon the presumption is not relaxed, although perhaps there is no\r\nactual probability of such an event taking place. Persons are kept in\r\nattendance at the cemetery on this presumption, and with respect to them\r\nit is expressly provided:—\r\n\r\n  (7.) If roughness be shown by a nurse to the dead, he must be\r\n  punished with instant dismissal, and a notification of the same must\r\n  be given by the Cemetery Commission, to the police, in order that\r\n  proper inquiry and punishment be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Moral influence of seclusion from thronged places, and of decorative\r\nImprovements in National Cemeteries, and arrangements requisite for the\r\n              satisfactory performance of Funeral Rites._\r\n\r\n§ 172. The images presented to the mind by the _visible_ arrangements\r\nfor sepulture, are inseparably associated with the ideas of death itself\r\nto the greater proportion of the population. Neglected or mismanaged\r\nburial grounds superadd to the indefinite terrors of dissolution, the\r\nrevolting image of festering heaps, disturbed and scattered bones, the\r\nprospect of a charnel house and its associations of desecration and\r\ninsult. With burial grounds that are undrained, for example, the\r\nassociations expressed by the labouring classes on the occasion of\r\nburial there, are similar to those which would arise on plunging a\r\nsentient body into a “watery grave.” Where there is nothing visible to\r\nraise such painful associations, a feeling of dislike is manifested to\r\nthe “common” burial grounds in crowded districts, or to their\r\n“dreariness” in the districts which are the least frequented.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. H. H. Milman, the rector of St. Margaret’s, Westminster,\r\nprobably adverts to these associations when questioned before the\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons with reference to the expediency of\r\ndiscontinuing burial in his own parish.\r\n\r\n  2744. In reference to the churchyard of St. Margaret’s, is that full\r\n  or not?—It is very full.\r\n\r\n  2745. Can you with convenience inter there?—My own opinion is, that\r\n  interment ought to be discontinued there for several reasons; not\r\n  because I have ever heard of any noxious effect upon the health of\r\n  the neighbourhood, _but on account of the public situation; it is a\r\n  thoroughfare_, and, in point of fact, it has been a cemetery so\r\n  long, and it is so crowded, that interment cannot take place without\r\n  interfering with previous interments.\r\n\r\nMr. Wordsworth, in a paper first published by Mr. Coleridge, has thus\r\nexpressed the same sentiments, and the feelings, which it is submitted,\r\nare entitled to regard, in legislating upon this subject:—\r\n\r\n“In ancient times, as is well known, it was the custom to bury the dead\r\nbeyond the walls of towns and cities, and among the Greeks and Romans\r\nthey were frequently interred by the way sides.\r\n\r\n“I could here pause with pleasure, and invite the reader to indulge with\r\nme in contemplation of the advantages which must have attended such a\r\npractice. We might ruminate on the beauty which the monuments thus\r\nplaced must have borrowed from the surrounding images of nature, from\r\nthe trees, the wild flowers, from a stream running within sight or\r\nhearing, from the beaten road, stretching its weary length hard by. Many\r\ntender similitudes must these objects have presented to the mind of the\r\ntraveller, leaning upon one of the tombs, or reposing in the coolness of\r\nits shades, whether he had halted from weariness, or in compliance with\r\nthe invitation, ‘Pause traveller,’ so often found upon the monuments.\r\nAnd to its epitaph must have been supplied strong appeals to visible\r\nappearances or immediate impressions, lively and affecting analogies of\r\nlife as a journey—death as a sleep overcoming the tired wayfarer—of\r\nmisfortune as a storm that falls suddenly upon him—of beauty as a flower\r\nthat passeth away, or of innocent pleasure as one that may be\r\ngathered—of virtue that standeth firm as a rock against the beating\r\nwaves, of hope undermined insensibly like the poplar by the side of the\r\nriver that has fed it, or blasted in a moment like a pine tree by the\r\nstroke of lightning on the mountain top—of admonitions and\r\nheart-stirring remembrances, like a refreshing breeze that comes without\r\nwarning, or the taste of the waters of an unexpected fountain. These and\r\nsimilar suggestions must have given formerly, to the language of the\r\nsenseless stone, a voice enforced and endeared by the benignity of that\r\nnature with which it was in unison.\r\n\r\n“We in modern times have lost much of these advantages; and they are but\r\nin a small degree counter-balanced to the inhabitants of large towns and\r\ncities, by the custom of depositing the dead within or contiguous to\r\ntheir places of worship, however splendid or imposing may be the\r\nappearance of those edifices, or however interesting or salutary may be\r\nthe associations connected with them. Even were it not true, that tombs\r\nlose their monitory virtue when thus obtruded upon the notice of men\r\noccupied with the cares of the world, and too often sullied and defiled\r\nby those cares; yet still, when death is in our thoughts, nothing can\r\nmake amends for the want of the soothing influences of nature, and for\r\nthe absence of those types of renovation and decay which the fields and\r\nwoods offer to the notice of the serious and contemplative mind. To feel\r\nthe force of this sentiment, let a man only compare, in imagination, the\r\nunsightly manner in which our monuments are crowded together in the\r\nbusy, noisy, unclean, and almost grassless churchyard of a large town,\r\nwith the still seclusion of a Turkish cemetery in some remote place, and\r\nyet further sanctified by the grove of cypress in which it is\r\nembosomed.”\r\n\r\n§ 173. Careful visible arrangements, of an agreeable nature, raise\r\ncorresponding mental images and associations which diminish the terrors\r\nincident to the aspect of death. Individuals who have purchased portions\r\nof decorated cemeteries for their own interment in the metropolis, make\r\na practice of visiting them for the sake, doubtless, of those solemn but\r\ntranquil thoughts which the place inspires as personally connected with\r\nthemselves. The establishment of a cemetery at Highgate was strongly\r\nopposed by the inhabitants, but when its decorations with flowers and\r\nshrubs and trees, and its quiet and seclusion were seen, applications\r\nwere made for the purchase of keys, which conferred the privilege of\r\nwalking in the cemetery at whatever time the purchaser pleased. If the\r\nchief private cemeteries in the suburbs of the metropolis were thrown\r\nopen on a Sunday, they would on fine days be often thronged by a\r\nrespectful population. Such private cemeteries as have been formed,\r\nthough pronounced to be only improvements on the places of burial in\r\nthis country, and far below what it would yet be practicable to\r\naccomplish, have indisputably been viewed with public satisfaction, and\r\nhave created desires of further advances by the erection of national\r\ncemeteries. Abroad the national cemeteries have obtained the deepest\r\nhold on the affections of the population. I have been informed by an\r\naccomplished traveller, who has carefully observed their effects, that\r\ncemeteries have been established near to all the large towns in the\r\nUnited States. To some of these cemeteries an horticultural garden is\r\nattached; the garden walks being connected with the places of interment,\r\nwhich, though decorated, are kept apart. Those cemeteries are places of\r\npublic resort, and are there observed, as in other countries, to have a\r\npowerful effect in soothing the feelings of those who have departed\r\nfriends, and in refining the feelings of all. At Constantinople, the\r\nplace of promenade for Europeans is the cemetery at Pera, which is\r\nplanted with cypress, and has a delightful position on the side of a\r\nhill overlooking the Golden Horn. The greatest public cemetery attached\r\nto that capital is at Scutari, which forms a beautiful grove, and\r\ndisputes in attraction, as a place for readers, with the fountains and\r\ncloisters of the Mosques.\r\n\r\n§ 174. In Russia, almost every town of importance has its burial place\r\nat a distance from the town, laid out by the architect of the\r\ngovernment. It is always well planted with trees, and is frequently\r\nornamented with good pieces of sculpture. Nearly every German town has\r\nits cemetery at a distance from the town, planted with trees and\r\nornamented with public and private monuments. Most of the cemeteries\r\nhave some choice works of art or public monument, which alone would\r\nrender them an object of attraction. For instance, at Saxe Weimar, the\r\ncemetery contains the tombs of Goethe and Schiller placed in the\r\nmausoleum of the ducal family. In Turkey, Russia, and Germany the poorer\r\nclasses have the advantages of interment in the national cemeteries. In\r\nRussia it is the practice to hold festivals twice a-year over the graves\r\nof their friends. In several parts of Germany similar customs prevail.\r\nAt Munich, the festival on All Saints’ Day (November the 1st) is\r\ndescribed as one of the most extraordinary spectacles that is to be seen\r\nin Europe.[33] The tombs are decorated in a most remarkable manner with\r\nflowers, natural and artificial, branches of trees, canopies, pictures,\r\nsculptures, and every conceivable object that can be applied to ornament\r\nor decorate. The labour bestowed on some tombs requires so much time,\r\nthat it is commenced two or three days beforehand, and protected while\r\ngoing on by a temporary roof. During the whole of the night preceding\r\nthe 1st of November, the relations of the dead are occupied in\r\ncompleting the decoration of the tombs, and during the whole of All\r\nSaints’ Day and the day following, being All Souls’ Day, the cemetery is\r\nvisited by the entire population of Munich, including the king and\r\nqueen, who go there on foot, and many strangers from distant parts. Mr.\r\nLoudon states that, when he was there, it was estimated that 50,000\r\npersons had walked round the cemetery in one day, the whole, with very\r\nfew exceptions, dressed in black. On November the 3rd, about mid-day,\r\nthe more valuable decorations are removed, and the remainder left to\r\ndecay from the effects of time and weather.\r\n\r\n§ 175. A review of the circumstances influencing the public feeling, and\r\nof the tendencies marked by the recent changes of practice in this\r\ncountry, and of the effects of the public institutions for interment\r\namongst other civilised nations, enforce the conclusion that those\r\narrangements to which the attention of the population is so earnestly\r\ndirected, should be made with the greatest care, and that places of\r\npublic burial demand the highest order of art in laying out the sites,\r\nand decorating them with trees and architectural structures of a solemn\r\nand elevating character. National arrangements with such objects, would\r\nbe followed up and supported by the munificence of private individuals,\r\nand by various communities. It is observable in the metropolis, and in\r\nthe larger towns that the direction of private feeling in the choice of\r\nsepulture is less affected by locality or neighbourhood, than by classes\r\nof profession or occupation, or social communion when living, and that\r\nsuch feeling would tend to association in the grave and monumental\r\ndecoration. A proposal has been in circulation for the purchase of a\r\nportion of one of the new cemeteries, for the erection of a mausoleum\r\nfor persons of the naval and military professions—members of the United\r\nService clubs. At the public cemetery of Mayence are interred 150\r\nveteran soldiers, officers and privates, natives of the town, who were\r\nburied in one spot, denoted by a monument on which each man’s name and\r\ncourse of service is inscribed in gold letters, and the monument is\r\nsurmounted by a statue of the general under whom they served. At Berlin\r\nthere is a cemetery connected with the _Invaleiden haus_ founded by\r\nFrederick the Great, in which many of the generals are buried with the\r\nprivate soldiers. The ground is well laid out, and ornamented with\r\nmonuments, the latest of which are executed by Tieck, and other\r\ncelebrated sculptors. This cemetery forms the favourite walk of the old\r\nsoldiers. The great moral force, and the consolation to the dying and\r\nthe incentive to public spirit whilst living, derivable from the natural\r\nregulations of a public cemetery, is almost entirely lost in this\r\ncountry, except in the few cases where public monuments are provided in\r\nthe cathedrals. In the metropolis it would be very difficult to find the\r\ngraves of persons of minor fame who have advanced or adorned any branch\r\nof civil or military service, or have distinguished themselves in any\r\nart or science. Yet there are few occupations which could not furnish\r\nexamples for pleasurable contemplation to the living who are engaged in\r\nthem, and claim honour from the public. The humblest class of artisans\r\nwould feel consolation and honour in interment in the same cemetery with\r\nBrindley, with Crompton, or with Murdoch, the artisan who assisted and\r\ncarried out the conceptions of Watt; or with Emerson, or with Simpson,\r\nthe hand-loom weaver, who became professor of mathematics at Woolwich;\r\nor with Ferguson, the shepherd’s son; or with Dollond, the improver of\r\ntelescopes, whose earliest years were spent at a loom in Spitalfields;\r\nor with others who “have risen from the wheelbarrow” and done honour to\r\nthe country, and individually gained public attention from the ranks of\r\nprivates; such for example as John Sykes, Nelson’s cockswain, an old and\r\nfaithful follower, who twice saved the life of his admiral by parrying\r\nthe blows that were aimed at him, and at last actually interposed his\r\nown person to meet the blow of an enemy’s sabre which he could not by\r\nany other means avert, and who survived the dangerous wound he received\r\nin this act of heroic attachment. The greater part of the means of\r\nhonour and moral influence on the living generation derivable from the\r\nexample of the meritorious dead of every class, is at present in the\r\nlarger towns cast away in obscure grave-yards and offensive charnels.\r\nThe artisans who are now associated in communities which have from their\r\nbeneficent objects a claim to public regard, might if they chose it have\r\ntheir spaces set apart for the members of their own occupation, and\r\nwhilst they derive interest from association with each other, they would\r\nalso derive consolation from accommodation within the same precincts as\r\nthe more public and illustrious dead.\r\n\r\n§ 176. It is due to the memory of Sir Christopher Wren, to state that\r\nextra-mural or suburban cemeteries formed part of his plan for the\r\nrebuilding of London after the great fire. “I would wish,” says he,\r\n“that all burials in churches might be disallowed, which is not only\r\nunwholesome, but the pavements can never be kept even, nor pews upright:\r\nand if the church-yard be close about the church, this is also\r\ninconvenient, because the ground being continually raised by the graves,\r\noccasions in time a descent by steps into the church, which renders it\r\ndamp, and the walls green, as appears evidently in all old churches. It\r\nwill be inquired where, then, shall be the burials?—I answer, in\r\ncemeteries seated in the outskirts of the town; and since it has become\r\nthe fashion of the age to solemnize funerals by a train of coaches (even\r\nwhere the deceased are of moderate condition), though the cemeteries\r\nshould be half a mile or more distant from the church, the charge need\r\nbe little or no more than usual; the service may be first performed in\r\nthe church: but for the poor and such as must be interred at the parish\r\ncharge, a public hearse of two wheels and one horse may be kept at small\r\nexpense, the usual bearers to lead the horse, and take out the corpse at\r\nthe grave. A piece of ground of two acres, in the fields, will be\r\npurchased for much less than two roods amongst the buildings. This being\r\nenclosed with a strong brick wall, and having a walk round, and two\r\ncross walks, decently planted with yew trees, the four quarters may\r\nserve four parishes, where the dead need not be disturbed at the\r\npleasure of the sexton, or piled four or five upon one another, or bones\r\nthrown out to gain room. In these places beautiful monuments may be\r\nerected; but yet the dimensions should be regulated by an architect, and\r\nnot left to the fancy of every mason; for thus the rich with large\r\nmarble tombs would shoulder out the poor: when a pyramid, a good bust,\r\nor statue on a proper pedestal will take up little room in the quarters,\r\nand be properer than figures lying on marble beds: the walls will\r\ncontain escutcheons and memorials for the dead, and the real good air\r\nand walks for the living. It may be considered, further, that if the\r\ncemeteries be thus thrown into the fields, they will bound the excessive\r\ngrowth of the city with a graceful border which is now encircled with\r\nscavenger’s dung-stalls.”[34]\r\n\r\n§ 177. I might submit the concurrent opinions of several distinguished\r\nclergymen, communicated in reference to the general view of the\r\nimportance of a large change in the practice of town interments, and the\r\nformation of suburban cemeteries, as being indeed conformable to the\r\npractice of the Jews and early Christians, and recognised in the words\r\n“There was a dead man carried _out_.” It was the ancient practice, as is\r\nperhaps indicated in the term exsequies, to bury outside of the\r\ntown.[35] To this practice it is clear that the earliest Christians\r\nconformed. It was their custom to assign to the martyrs the most\r\nconspicuous places, over which altars or monuments were erected, where\r\nthe believers used to assemble for nightly worship, so that it may\r\nrather be said of them that their burial places were their churches,\r\nthan that their churches were their burial places.[36] When the temples\r\nof the heathen gods were converted into Christian churches, the _bones_\r\nor relics of these illustrious persons, together with the altars, were\r\nremoved and placed within the churches. The early practice of burial in\r\nthe cemeteries near the earthly remains of those holy persons, being\r\ndeemed a great privilege when those remains were removed, naturally led\r\nto the idea of its continuation, by the interment of _bodies_ in or\r\nabout the first accustomed objects of worship. Nevertheless, interment\r\nin the interior of the church was held to be an unusual piece of good\r\nfortune, and when the Emperor Constantine, who had constituted\r\nChristianity the religion of the state, had granted to him a grave\r\nwithin the porticos of the church, it was esteemed the most unheard-of\r\ndistinction. The ancient Greeks and Romans thought that a corpse\r\ncontaminated a sacred place, and this idea as to the corpse was retained\r\nby the early Christians. When some persons in Constantinople began to\r\nmake an invasion upon the laws, under pretence that there was no express\r\nprohibition of burying in churches, Theodosius, by a new law, equally\r\nforbade them burying in cities and burying in churches; and this whether\r\nit was only the ashes or relics of any bodies kept above ground in urns\r\nor whole bodies laid in coffins; for the same reasons that the old laws\r\nhad assigned, viz., that they might be examples and memorials of\r\nmortality and the condition of human nature to all passengers, and also\r\nthat they might not defile the habitations of the living but leave it\r\npure and clean to them. St. Chrysostom, in one of his homilies upon the\r\nmartyrs, says, “As before when the festival of the Maccabees was\r\ncelebrated all the country came thronging into the city; so now when the\r\nfestival of the martyrs who lie buried in the country is celebrated, it\r\nwas fit the whole country should remove thither.” In like manner,\r\nspeaking of the festival of Drossis the martyr, he says, “Though they\r\nhad spiritual entertainment in the city, yet their going out to the\r\nsaints in the country afforded them both great profit and pleasure.” The\r\nCouncil of Tribur, in the time of Charlemagne, to prevent the abuse of\r\nburying within churches, decreed that _no layman_ should thenceforth be\r\nburied within a church; and that if in any church graves were so\r\nnumerous that they could not be concealed by a pavement the place was to\r\nbe converted into a cemetery, and the altar to be removed elsewhere and\r\nerected in a place where sacrifice could be religiously offered to God.\r\n\r\nAmongst the distinct clerical orders of the Primitive Church, Bingham\r\n(book iii. chap. 7) reckons the _Psalmistæ_, the _Copiatæ_, and the\r\n_Parabolani_. The Psalmistæ, or the canonical singers, were appointed to\r\nretrieve and improve the psalmody of the church. The business of the\r\nCopiatæ was to take care of funerals and provide for the decent\r\ninterment of the dead. St. Jerome styles them _Fossarii_, from digging\r\nof graves; and in Justinian’s Novels they are called _Lecticarii_, from\r\ncarrying the corpse or bier at funerals. And St. Jerome, speaking of one\r\nthat was to be interred, “The _Clerici_,” says he, “whose office it was,\r\nwound up the body, digged the earth,” and so, according to custom, “made\r\nready the grave.” Constantine incorporated a body of men to the number\r\nof 1100 in Constantinople, under the name of _Copiatæ_, for the service\r\nin question, and so they continued to the time of Honorius and\r\nTheodosius, junior, who reduced them to 950; but Anastatius augmented\r\nthem again to the first number, which Justinian confirmed by two novels,\r\npublished for that purpose. Their office was to take the whole care of\r\nfunerals upon themselves, and to see that all persons had a decent and\r\nhonourable interment. Especially they were obliged to perform this last\r\noffice to the poorer people without exacting anything of their relations\r\nupon that account. The _Parabolani_ were incorporated at Alexandria to\r\nthe number of 500 or 600, who were deputed to attend upon the sick, and\r\ntake care of their bodies in time of weakness.[37] [Cod. Theod., leg.\r\n43:—“Parabolani, qui ad curanda debilium corpora deputantur, quingentos\r\nesse ante præcipimus; sed quia hos minus sufficere in præsenti\r\ncognovimus, pro quingentis sex centos constitui præcipimus,” &c.] They\r\nwere called _Parabolani_ from their undertaking (Παραβολον ἔργον) a most\r\ndangerous office in attending the sick. The foundation of a great city\r\nlike Constantinople must have brought the magnitude of the service of\r\nthe burial of the whole population distinctly under view, and have\r\nnecessitated comprehensive and systematic arrangements of a\r\ncorresponding extent, by the superintendence of superior officers\r\nthrough the gradations of duty of a disciplined force, which, even with\r\nthe Eastern redundance of service, could scarcely have failed to be\r\nefficient and economical as compared with numerous separated and\r\nisolated efforts. A great prototype was thus gained, and the\r\nwell-considered gradations of duty and service of the great city was\r\ncarried out as far as practicable in the small parish. In some churches,\r\nwhere there was no such standing office as the Copiatæ or the\r\nParabolani, the Penitents were obliged to take upon themselves the\r\noffice and care of burying the dead; “and this by way of discipline and\r\nexercise of humility and charity which were so becoming their station.”\r\n_Bingham_, book xviii. cap. 2. The state of administrative information\r\nin these our times may surely be deplored, when any views can be\r\nentertained of making the small parish and the rude and barbarous\r\nservice (multiplied, at an enormous expense) of the really\r\nunsuperintended common gravedigger and sexton, the prototypes for this\r\nmost important and difficult branch of public administration of the\r\ngreatest metropolis in the modern world.\r\n\r\nOn a full consideration I think it will be apparent that the exclusion\r\nof the burial of corpses in churches or in churchyards, and the adoption\r\nof burials in cemeteries, and the conspicuous interment there of all\r\nindividuals whose lives and services have graced communities, will, in\r\nso far as it is carried out, be in principle a return to the primitive\r\npractice, restoring to the many the privilege, of which they are\r\nnecessarily deprived by burials in churches, of association in sepulture\r\nwith the illustrious dead, and giving to these a wider sphere of\r\nattention and honour, and beneficent influence.\r\n\r\nOn the immediate question of the arrangements for sepulture I beg leave\r\nto submit for consideration the following extracts from a communication\r\nfrom the Rev. H. Milman, which is more peculiarly due to him, as his\r\nexamination before the Committee of the House of Commons does not appear\r\nto have elicited his full and matured opinions on the important\r\nsubject:—\r\n\r\n  I cannot but consider the sanitary part of the question, as the most\r\n  dubious, and as resting on less satisfactory evidence than other\r\n  considerations involved in the inquiry. The decency, the solemnity,\r\n  the Christian impressiveness of burial, in my opinion, are of far\r\n  greater and more undeniable importance.\r\n\r\n  It must unquestionably be a government measure in its management as\r\n  well as its organization. If you have understood my evidence as\r\n  recommending parochial, rather than a general administration, such\r\n  was not my intention. I thought that I had left that point quite\r\n  open. When I stated (2729) the alternative of cemeteries provided by\r\n  the national funds, and by parochial taxation, I represented the\r\n  unpopularity of the latter mode of taxation: and (in 2782) I\r\n  suggested certain advantages to be derived from the more general and\r\n  public administration. The Committee, however, who seemed to incline\r\n  strongly towards the parochial system, went off in that direction,\r\n  and the questions turned rather on the practicability of that\r\n  system, and the manner in which it might be organized.\r\n\r\n  Further reflection leads me to the strong conviction that the\r\n  parochial system, even if there were no difficulties in forming the\r\n  union of the smaller parishes for this object, could only furnish so\r\n  loose and uncertain a superintendence over an affair of such\r\n  magnitude, and requiring such constant vigilance, as to be\r\n  altogether inadequate to the purpose. It is not easy, with their\r\n  present burthens and responsibilities, to fill the parochial offices\r\n  with men competent to the duty, and with sufficient leisure to\r\n  devote to it. They are usually filled by men in business of some\r\n  kind, with considerable sacrifice of their time, and of that\r\n  attention which is required by their personal concerns. These\r\n  duties, however are confined, onerous as they sometimes are, to\r\n  their own immediate neighbourhood. But if we add to their\r\n  responsibilities, the care of a remote and large churchyard, with\r\n  all its complicated management, we impose upon them duties so\r\n  arduous and so incompatible with their own interests and avocations,\r\n  that the conscientious would shrink from undertaking them, and they\r\n  would fall into the hands of a lower class of busy persons, anxious\r\n  for notoriety, or with some remote view of advantage to themselves.\r\n  It will be absolutely necessary to relieve the parish officers from\r\n  a burthen which they cannot undertake without a sacrifice, which is\r\n  more than can be expected from men engaged in business or in some of\r\n  the active professions. Besides all this, the administration would\r\n  be constantly passing from one to another; the objection to the\r\n  whole parochial system, that a man no sooner learns the duty of his\r\n  office, than he is released from it, would apply in a tenfold degree\r\n  to an affair of such magnitude. The only way to secure the proper\r\n  organization and conduct of a remote cemetery, would be by officers,\r\n  judiciously selected, and adequately paid, who should devote their\r\n  whole time to the business. Many of these objections, as the want of\r\n  sufficient time without neglecting more serious duties, would apply\r\n  to the clergyman of a large town parish, and if the cemetery be made\r\n  an object of parochial taxation, the less he is involved in it the\r\n  better.\r\n\r\n  On the wise and maturely considered organization, and on the\r\n  provisions for the careful, constant, and vigilant superintendence\r\n  of the whole system, will depend entirely its fulfilment of its\r\n  great object, the re-investment of the funeral services, and of the\r\n  sacred abode of the dead, in their due solemnity and religious\r\n  influence. Nothing can be more beautiful, more soothing under the\r\n  immediate influence of sorrow, or at all times more suggestive of\r\n  tranquil, yet deep religious emotion, than the village churchyard,\r\n  where the clergyman, the squire, or the peasant, pass weekly or more\r\n  often by the quiet and hallowed graves of their kindred and friends,\r\n  to the house of prayer, and where hereafter they expect themselves\r\n  to be laid at rest under a stone perhaps, on which is expressed the\r\n  simple hope of resurrection to eternal life, and where all is so\r\n  peaceful, that the tomb may almost seem as if it might last\r\n  undisturbed to that time. I am inclined to think that some of the\r\n  unbounded popularity of Gray’s Elegy, independent of its exquisite\r\n  poetic execution, may arise from these associations. Of these\r\n  tranquillizing and elevating influences, so constantly refreshed and\r\n  renewed, the inhabitants of large cities are of necessity deprived.\r\n  The churchyard, often very small, always full, and crowded with\r\n  remains of former interments, either carelessly scattered about, or\r\n  but ill concealed, is in some cases a thoroughfare, where the\r\n  religious service is disturbed by the noises, if not of passing and\r\n  thoughtless strangers, with those of the din and traffic of the\r\n  neighbouring street; and the new made grave, or the stone, which has\r\n  just been fixed down, is trampled over by the passing crowd, or made\r\n  the play-place of idle children. Where, as in some of the larger\r\n  parishes in the west of London, the burial place is not contiguous\r\n  to the church, it is more decent, but then it is secluded within\r\n  high walls, or perhaps by houses, and is only open for the funeral\r\n  ceremony, at other times inaccessible to the mourning relatives.\r\n\r\n  But will it not be possible, as we cannot give to the population of\r\n  the metropolis, and other crowded towns, the quiet, the sanctity,\r\n  the proximity to the church of the village place of sepulture, to\r\n  substitute something at least decent, and with more appearance of\r\n  repose and permanence; if not solemn, serious, and religiously\r\n  impressive? The poor are peculiarly sensible of these impressions,\r\n  and to them impression and custom form a great part, the most\r\n  profound and universal influence of religion; and to them they\r\n  cannot be given but by some arrangement under the sanction, and with\r\n  the assistance, of the Government. Private speculation may give\r\n  something of this kind to the rich, but private speculation looks\r\n  for a return of profit for its invested capital. To my mind there is\r\n  something peculiarly repugnant in Joint-Stock Burial and Cemetery\r\n  Companies. But, setting that aside, they are and can be of no use to\r\n  the _people_ of the metropolis and the large towns. There always has\r\n  been, and probably always will be, some distinction in the burial\r\n  rites (I beg to say that to the credit of my curates, they refuse to\r\n  make any difference between rich and poor in the services of the\r\n  church) and in the humbler or more costly grave of rich and poor—\r\n\r\n                     Here lie I beside the door,\r\n                     Here lie I because I am poor;\r\n                     Further in the more they pay,\r\n                     Here lie I as well as they.\r\n\r\n  But it may be a question whether the very numbers of funerals, which\r\n  must take place for a large town, with the extent of the burial\r\n  places, may not be made a source of solemnity and impressiveness,\r\n  which may in some degree compensate for the individual and immediate\r\n  interest excited by a funeral in a small parish. That which at\r\n  present, when left to a single harassed and exhausted clergyman, and\r\n  one sexton, and a few wretched assistants, can hardly avoid the\r\n  appearance of hurry and confusion, might be so regulated as to\r\n  impose, from the very gathering of such masses of mortality,\r\n  bequeathed together to their common earth, not (let me be\r\n  understood) in one vault or pit, but each apart in his decent grave.\r\n  The vast extent of cemetery which would be required for London\r\n  (suppose six or eight for the whole metropolis and its suburbs), if\r\n  properly kept, and with such architectural decorations, and the\r\n  grand and solemn shade of trees appropriate to the character of the\r\n  ground, could scarcely fail to impress the reflective mind, and even\r\n  to awe the more thoughtless. Our national character, and our more\r\n  sober religion, will preserve us, probably, from the affectations\r\n  and fantastic fineries of the Père la Chaise ground at Paris. From\r\n  some of the German cemeteries we may learn much as to regulation,\r\n  and the proper character to be maintained in a cemetery of the dead.\r\n\r\n  National sepulture is a part, and a most important part of national\r\n  religion; of all the beautiful services of our Church, none is more\r\n  beautiful (I might wish, perhaps, two expressions altered) than our\r\n  service for burial. I could have wished that the Church had taken\r\n  the initiative in this great question. I trust that she will act, if\r\n  the State can be prevailed upon to move, in perfect harmony with the\r\n  general feeling on the subject. It is fortunate, that in the Bishop\r\n  of London we have not merely a person of liberal mind, and practical\r\n  views, but one who brings the experience of the parish priest of a\r\n  large London living to his Episcopal authority and influence.\r\n\r\n  One further practical suggestion occurs to me as likely most\r\n  materially to diminish the expenditure of funerals of all classes,\r\n  and therefore to render any great scheme more feasible. A funeral\r\n  procession through the streets of a great and busy town can scarcely\r\n  be made impressive. Not even the hearse, in its gorgeous gloom, with\r\n  all the pomp of heraldry, and followed by the carriages of half the\r\n  nobility of the land, will arrest for an instant the noise and\r\n  confusion of our streets, or awaken any deeper impression with the\r\n  mass than idle curiosity. While the poor man, borne on the shoulders\r\n  of men as poor as himself, is jostled off the pavement; the\r\n  mourners, at some crossing, are either in danger of being run over\r\n  or separated from the body; in the throng of passers no sign of\r\n  reverence, no stirring of conscious mortality in the heart. Besides\r\n  this, if, as must be the case, the cemeteries are at some distance,\r\n  often a considerable distance, from the homes of the deceased, to\r\n  those who are real mourners nothing can be more painful or\r\n  distressing than this long, wearisome, never-ending—perhaps often\r\n  interrupted—march; while those who attend out of compliment to the\r\n  deceased while away the time in idle gossip in the mourning coach,\r\n  to which perhaps they endeavour to give—but, if their feelings are\r\n  not really moved, endeavour in vain to give—a serious turn. Abandon,\r\n  then, this painful and ineffective part of the ceremony; let the\r\n  dead be conveyed with decency, but with more expedition, under\r\n  trustworthy care, to the cemetery; there form the procession, there\r\n  assemble the friends and relatives; concentrate the whole effect on\r\n  the actual service, and do not allow the mind to be disturbed and\r\n  distracted by the previous mechanical arrangements, and the extreme\r\n  wearisome length of that which, if not irreverent and distressing,\r\n  cannot, from the circumstances, be otherwise than painfully tedious.\r\n\r\n  It may be worth observing that, in London, even the passing bell\r\n  seems almost lost in the din and confusion. This is the case even in\r\n  the old churches, which retain their deep, full, and sonorous bells.\r\n  The quick shrill gingle, or the feeble tone of those which are\r\n  placed in the chapels of the more recent burial-grounds, instead of\r\n  deepening to my ear, are utterly discordant with the solemnity of\r\n  the service. In the country nothing can be finer than the tolling\r\n  from some old grey church tower—\r\n\r\n                    Over some wide watered shore,\r\n                    Swinging slow with solemn roar.\r\n\r\n  What would be the effect of a bell as large as St. Paul’s, heard at\r\n  stated times, or in the event of the funeral of some really\r\n  distinguished persons, from the distant cemetery?\r\n\r\n§ 178. The formation of national cemeteries would give the means of more\r\nspecial and appropriate service for the interment of the dead than it is\r\nnow possible to provide by small parochial establishments. In the more\r\npopulous parishes, the service is unavoidably hurried. In all, the\r\nfeelings of survivors require the most full, respectful, and impressive\r\nservice. In many of the rural districts, the friends and fellow-workmen\r\nof the deceased accompany the remains to the grave, and one object of\r\nsubscriptions to burial and general benefit clubs is to secure the\r\nadvantages of arrangements for the attendance of fellow-workmen, who are\r\nmembers of the same club. When a waterman dies, to whom his brethren\r\nwould pay respect, the body is conveyed by them in an eight-oared\r\ncutter, to the churchyard by the water-side. On their return, the seat\r\nwhich the deceased would have occupied is left vacant, and his oar, tied\r\nwith a piece of crape, is placed across the boat. One of the most\r\npopular and impressive of funeral ceremonies is that on the interment of\r\na private soldier. When a private of the metropolitan police dies, a\r\nnumber of members of the force, and a superior officer, attend his\r\nfuneral in their uniforms. It is not unfrequent when a member has been\r\ninvalided and left the force, that he will make it a dying request that\r\nhis funeral may be attended by the officer and men with whom he served.\r\nThis request is generally complied with. Old soldiers who have been\r\ninvalided frequently make it a dying request to the commanders of the\r\nregiments in which they have served that they may be buried as if they\r\nhad died in the service; and unless there be an exception to the\r\nrespectability of their conduct, the honour and consolation is bestowed.\r\n\r\n§ 179. In Scotland, it is a subject of intense desire on the part of the\r\nlabouring classes to gain the attendance of some person of higher\r\ncondition at their funerals. When an aged and exemplary member of a\r\ncongregation dies, it is not unfrequent that the minister’s eldest son\r\nwill pay respect, by acting as one of the bearers of the corpse. In many\r\nof the rural districts in England, the persons composing the procession\r\nwill sing hymns. In the churches, anthems are still sung, and funeral\r\ndiscourses given in the manner described by the Rev. Dr. Russell, the\r\nrector of Bishopsgate.\r\n\r\n  When I was a boy (says the reverend gentleman), nothing was more\r\n  common, in the parish of which my father was rector, than for the\r\n  body to be brought into church before the commencement of the\r\n  evening service on Sundays. The psalms and lessons appointed for the\r\n  burial service were read instead of the psalms and the second lesson\r\n  of the evening. At the time of singing, a portion of those psalms\r\n  which have reference to the shortness of life was sung; and\r\n  sometimes an ambitious choir would attempt a hymn—‘Vital spark of\r\n  heavenly flame,’ or the like. Since I have been in orders, I have\r\n  myself occasionally, in the country, buried persons with a similar\r\n  service. Sometimes funeral sermons were preached.\r\n\r\n§ 180. The natives of the provinces, when they attend the remains of\r\ntheir friends to the grave in London, frequently express a wish to have\r\nanthems or such solemnities as those to which they have been\r\naccustomed.[38]\r\n\r\n§ 181. The formation of national cemeteries would enable the\r\necclesiastical authorities to provide means for complying with the\r\ndesire thus expressed. Under general arrangements, with reduced\r\nexpenses, it will be seen that ample pecuniary provision for it may be\r\nmade to give to the funerals of the many the most impressive solemnity.\r\nOn this subject, the Rev. Mr. Stone, rector of Spitalfields, observes—\r\n\r\n  Should the legislature determine upon removing the burial of the\r\n  dead from populous places, it would get rid of these mischiefs; and\r\n  should it adopt a national system of burial instead of the highly\r\n  objectionable parochial system sketched out in Mr. Mackinnon’s Bill,\r\n  it might do much more—it might greatly add to the solemnity of our\r\n  burial obsequies, and so make them at once more impressive and more\r\n  attractive. This might be done by concentration; instead of the\r\n  parochial clergyman, hurried to the performance of this affecting\r\n  service, when his time, attention, and sympathies are engaged by\r\n  other duties, summoned desultorily to it, and often compelled to\r\n  repeat it over and over again at the same grave, just as the\r\n  interest or the convenience of undertakers, the caprice, the\r\n  bigotry, or the carousals of mourners may choose to prescribe, let\r\n  ministers appointed to officiate in national cemeteries perform the\r\n  service over great numbers at once, and at two or three stated hours\r\n  in every day. But the performance of the burial service over great\r\n  numbers at the same time would add incalculably to its solemnity. In\r\n  the present state of things, simultaneous interments are supposed,\r\n  as they certainly are primarily intended, merely to save the time\r\n  and labour of the clergy; and they may sometimes be hurried through\r\n  in a manner so careless, slovenly, and unfeeling, as not even the\r\n  necessities of the clergy can excuse. But it is quite a confusion of\r\n  ideas to suppose that the practice itself is slovenly and unfeeling.\r\n  On the contrary, I find it more impressive in its effect upon\r\n  myself; and I think it must prove so to others. Two or three\r\n  coffins, placed with their sable draperies in the body of the\r\n  church, are in themselves an awful spectacle; and the attendant\r\n  mourners, occupying the surrounding pews clothed in the same livery\r\n  of death, form a congregation at once appropriate, and large enough\r\n  to give effect to a religious service. By their numbers, too, they\r\n  operate against the intrusion of idle gossips and inquisitive\r\n  gazers, and, associated as they are with each other in a bereavement\r\n  of the same kind, they are thus brought into a contact calculated to\r\n  kindle emotions of social sympathy and religious sensibility.\r\n  Assembled in the burial ground round the same grave, or disposed in\r\n  groups by the side of graves within a reasonable distance of each\r\n  other, they form a picture of the same affecting and impressive\r\n  character. If the sympathy of a public assembly is perceptible or\r\n  intense in proportion to the numbers that compose it, this\r\n  aggregation of burials need only be limited by the effective power\r\n  of the human voice.\r\n\r\n  Judging from an experiment of my own, I think that these salutary\r\n  effects would be heightened to a thrilling degree by music. And from\r\n  the practice of the highest civil and ecclesiastical authorities, I\r\n  presume that the introduction of music into the burial office is not\r\n  inconsistent with the rubric. At a burial already alluded to, I\r\n  acceded to a special request by allowing the introduction of some\r\n  organ-music; and, having no rubrical directions on the point, I\r\n  selected two parts of the service as those in which music seemed to\r\n  me to be most admissible, and most likely to prove impressive. After\r\n  the officiating minister has preceded the corpse from the entrance\r\n  of the church and read the introductory sentences, there is an\r\n  interval, during which he ascends the desk, the mourners take their\r\n  places in the pews assigned to them, and the corpse is deposited in\r\n  the body of the church; and there is a still longer interval, during\r\n  which the melancholy procession leaves the church for the burial\r\n  ground. I found that both these intervals, which are unavoidably\r\n  disturbed by somewhat bustling and noisy arrangements, were most\r\n  usefully and effectively filled up by the introduction of music. The\r\n  subjoined scheme of the music performed at royal burials will prove\r\n  that I was not mistaken in supposing music consistent with the\r\n  rubric, nor much so in selecting those parts of the service, at\r\n  which I prescribed its introduction. It will also serve to show to\r\n  what an extent music might be made to give effect and attractiveness\r\n  to a national burial of the dead.\r\n\r\n           Parts of the Service.                             Musical\r\n                                                            Composer.\r\n “I am the resurrection,” &c.              Sung           Croft.\r\n “I know that my Redeemer liveth,” &c.     Ditto          Croft.\r\n “We brought nothing into this world,” &c. Ditto          Croft.\r\n The Psalms are chanted                      Chant in G minor Purcell.\r\n\r\nAfter the lesson, and before the removal of the corpse from its station\r\nin the choir, an anthem is introduced _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\n “Man that is born of a woman,” &c.        Sung           Croft.\r\n “In the midst of life,” &c.               Ditto          Croft.\r\n “Yet, O Lord God, most holy,” &c.         Ditto          Croft.\r\n “Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets,” &c.    Ditto          Purcell.\r\n “I heard a voice from heaven,” &c.        Ditto          Croft.\r\n\r\nImmediately before the Collect, “O merciful God,” or sometimes, though\r\nvery seldom, before “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,” an anthem is\r\nintroduced _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the service, while the mourners are moving off, the Dead\r\nMarch in Saul is played on the organ.\r\n\r\nThe anthems usually selected are two of the following:—\r\n\r\n             “When the ear heard,” &c.              Handel.\r\n             “I have set God always before me,” &c. Blake.\r\n             “The souls of the righteous,” &c.      Dupuis.\r\n             “Hear my prayer,” &c.                  Kent.\r\n\r\nOn the burial of esteemed members of the cathedral choirs, the other\r\nchoristers have sung the highest and most solemn of the church music.\r\n\r\n§ 182. Where the circumstances described, in respect to the Protestant\r\npopulation, have prevented compliance with the popular desire for hymns\r\nor anthems to be sung or sermons to be spoken at the burial at the\r\nparochial churches in London, interment has been purchased for the\r\nexpress purpose of obtaining them at the trading burial grounds. And yet\r\nit may be submitted that the desire is consistent with the earliest\r\nrecognized practice for all classes,[39] and that a system of national\r\ncemeteries would in proportion to the numbers interred in them, furnish\r\nvaluable cases as examples for its beneficial exercise, and must, to a\r\ngreat extent, prevent the misapplication of the service to such cases as\r\nhave apparently caused it to fall in public esteem.\r\n\r\n“The honour,” says Hooker, “generally due unto all men maketh a decent\r\ninterring of them to be convenient, even for very humanity’s sake. And\r\ntherefore so much as is mentioned in the burial of the widow’s son, the\r\ncarrying him forth upon a bier and accompanying him to the earth, hath\r\nbeen used even amongst infidels, all men accounting it a very extreme\r\ndestitution not to have at least this honour due to them.” * * * * “Let\r\nany man of reasonable judgment examine whether it be more convenient for\r\na company of men, as it were, in a dumb show to bring a corpse to a\r\nplace of burial, there to leave it, covered with earth, and so end, or\r\nelse to have the exsequies devoutly performed with solemn recitals of\r\nsuch lectures, psalms, and prayers, as are purposely framed for the\r\nstirring up of men’s minds into a careful consideration of their estate\r\nboth here and hereafter.\r\n\r\n“In regard to the quality of men, it hath been judged fit to commend\r\nthem unto the world at their death amongst the heathen in funeral\r\norations; amongst the Jews in sacred poems; and why not in funeral\r\nsermons amongst Christians? Us it sufficeth that the known benefit\r\nhereof doth countervail millions of such inconveniences as are therein\r\nsurmised, although they were not surmised only, but found therein.”\r\n* * * “The care no doubt of the living, both to live and die well, must\r\nneeds be somewhat increased when they know that their departure shall\r\nnot be folded up in silence, but the ears of many be made acquainted\r\nwith it. The sound of these things do not so pass the ears of them that\r\nare most loose and dissolute in life, but it causeth them one time or\r\nother to wish, ‘Oh that I might die the death of the righteous, and that\r\nmy end might be like his.’ Thus much peculiar good there doth grow at\r\nthose times by speech concerning the dead; besides the benefit of public\r\ninstruction common unto funeral with other sermons.”—_Hooker,\r\nEcclesiastical Polity_, b. v. ch. lxxv.\r\n\r\n“When thou hast wept awhile,” says Jeremy Taylor, in his Holy Dying,\r\n“compose the body to burial; which, that it be done gravely, decently,\r\nand charitably, we have the example of all nations to engage us, and of\r\nall ages of the world to warrant; so that it is against common honesty\r\nand public fame and reputation not to do this office.”—“The church, in\r\nher funerals of the dead, used to sing psalms and to give thanks for the\r\nredemption and delivery of the soul from the evil and dangers of\r\nmortality.”—“Solemn and appointed mournings are good expressions of our\r\ndearness to the departed soul, and of his worth and our value of him,\r\nand it hath its praise in nature, and in manners, and in public customs;\r\nbut the praise of it is not in the gospel, that is, it hath no direct\r\nand proper uses in religion; for if the dead did die in the Lord, then\r\nthere is joy to him, and it is an ill expression of our affection and\r\nour charity to weep uncomfortably at a change that hath carried my\r\nfriend to the state of a huge felicity.”—“Something is to be given to\r\ncustom, something to fame, to nature and to civilities, and to the\r\nhonour of deceased friends; for that man is esteemed to die miserable\r\nfor whom no friend or relation sheds a tear, or pays a solemn sigh. I\r\ndesire to die a dry death, but am not very desirous to have a dry\r\nfuneral; some flowers sprinkled on my grave would do well and comely;\r\nand a soft shower, to turn those flowers into a springing memory or a\r\nfair rehearsal, that I may not go forth of my doors, as my servants\r\ncarry the entrails of beasts.” * * * *\r\n\r\n“Concerning doing honour to the dead the consideration is not long.\r\nAnciently the friends of the dead used to make their funeral oration,\r\nand what they spake of greater commendation was pardoned on the accounts\r\nof friendship; but when Christianity seized on the possession of the\r\nworld, this charge was devolved on priests and bishops, and they first\r\nkept the custom of the world and adorned it with the piety of truth and\r\nof religion; but they also ordered it that it should not be cheap; for\r\nthey made funeral sermons only at the death of princes, or of such holy\r\npersons ‘who shall judge the angels.’ The custom descended, and in the\r\nchannels mingled with the veins of earth, through which it passed; and\r\nnow-a-days, men that die are commended at a price, and the measure of\r\ntheir legacy is the degree of their virtue. But these things ought not\r\nso to be; the reward of the greatest virtue ought not to be prostitute\r\nto the doles of common persons, but preserved like laurels and coronets\r\nto remark and encourage the noblest things. Persons of an ordinary life\r\nshould neither be praised publicly, nor reproached in private; for it is\r\nan offence and charge of humanity to speak no evil of the dead, which I\r\nsuppose, is meant concerning things not public and evident; but then\r\nneither should our charity to them teach us to tell a lie, or to make a\r\ngreat flame from a heap of rushes and mushrooms, and make orations\r\ncrammed with the narrative of little observances, and acts of civil,\r\nnecessary, and eternal religion. But that which is most considerable is,\r\nthat we should do something for the dead, something that is real and of\r\nproper advantage. That we perform their will, the laws oblige us, and\r\nwill see to it; but that we do all those parts of personal duty which\r\nour dead left unperformed, and to which the laws do not oblige us, is an\r\nact of great charity and perfect kindness.”—“Besides this, let us right\r\ntheir causes and assert their honour:” * * “and certainly it is the\r\nnoblest thing in the world to do an act of kindness to him whom we shall\r\nnever see, but yet hath deserved it of us, and to whom we would do it if\r\nhe were present; and unless we do so, our charity is mercenary, and our\r\nfriendships are direct merchandise, and our gifts are brocage: but what\r\nwe do to the dead, or to the living for their sakes, is gratitude, and\r\nvirtue for virtue’s sake, and the noblest portion of humanity.”\r\n\r\n\r\n _Necessity and nature of the superior agency requisite for private and\r\n              public protection in respect to interments._\r\n\r\n§ 183. Having given a view of the evils arising from the existing\r\npractice in respect to interments in towns, and an outline of what\r\nappears to be justly desired as necessary objects to supply the wants of\r\nthe population, I now beg leave to submit for consideration the\r\ninformation collected as to the practical means of obtaining them.\r\n\r\n§ 184. The most pressing of the evils being physical or sanitary evils,\r\nthe first means of amendment required is the appointment and arrangement\r\nof the qualifications, powers, and duties and responsibilities of an\r\nofficer of health, to whom the requisite changes of practice may be most\r\nsafely confided.\r\n\r\nThe functions of such an officer, as marked out by the evidence of\r\nexisting necessities, may be divided into the ordinary and the\r\nextraordinary. The immediate necessities are those which arise from the\r\nwant of a trustworthy person who maybe looked up to for counsel and\r\ndirection to survivors in the event of a death, §§ 121, 122, 123, 124,\r\nand guide a change of the practice of interment. It is only by an\r\narrangement that will carry a man of education, a responsible officer,\r\nto the house of even the poorest person in the community, just at the\r\ntime when a competent and trustworthy person is most needed to give\r\nadvice, that the effect of ignorant or interested suggestions may be\r\nprevented, and the beneficent intentions of the legislature, or the\r\nsalutary nature of any public arrangement for the general advantage can\r\nbe made known with certainty.\r\n\r\n§ 185. The ordinary service of such an officer would consist of the\r\nverification of the fact and cause of death, and its due civic\r\nregistration. From the exercise of these duties would follow the\r\nextraordinary duties of directing measures of immediate precaution and\r\nprevention, which it is to be feared whatsoever general sanitary\r\nmeasures might be adopted would, at the outset, and for too long a\r\nperiod, constitute ordinary and every-day duties. Out of the ordinary\r\nduties of the officer of health, would arise extraordinary\r\njurisprudential duties of protecting the interests of the community in\r\ncases of deaths which have occurred under circumstances of suspicion or\r\nof manifest criminality.\r\n\r\n§ 186. Assuming the necessity of the establishment of adequate national\r\ncemeteries at proper sites, it is proposed that a body of officers\r\nproperly qualified by service, as in the example § 185, should have\r\ncharge of the material arrangements, and take the place of the\r\nchurchwardens and overseers in respect to all places of burial, and be\r\nresponsible for the control of the servants of the establishment, and\r\nshall, moreover, be enabled to regulate and contract for supplies, at\r\nreduced prices, of materials and service of the nature of those now\r\nsupplied by the undertaker. §§ 150, 153, 154, 155.\r\n\r\n§ 187. In order that the officer of public health may be brought to the\r\nspot, it is proposed that the last medical attendant on the deceased\r\nshould, on a small payment, be required to give immediate notice of the\r\ndeath, in a form to be specified, or in case there happened to be no\r\nmedical attendant, it should then be incumbent on the occupier of the\r\nhouse, or the person having charge of the body, to give the required\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nBefore particularising the course of practice of such an officer, it\r\nappears requisite to state other grounds on which intervention appears\r\nrequisite for the verification of the fact of death, and the mode of\r\ndeath, by the inspection of the body previously to interment.\r\n\r\n§ 188. It is admitted that some additional arrangements are yet wanting\r\nfor the complete attainment of the proper civic and technical purposes\r\nof registration:—as depositaries of pre-appointed evidence of the fact\r\nof death, to determine questions of private rights:—as depositaries of\r\nevidence for purposes of medical science and public health, to show the\r\nextent and prevalence of common causes of disease incident to different\r\noccupations and different localities—and of the data for tables of\r\ninsurance, as well as for the recovery of sums assured, where the proof\r\nof age is not admitted in the policy. Any one who is unknown to the\r\nlocal registrar may go and register as a fact his own death, of which a\r\ncertified copy of the registry will, according to the 38th clause of the\r\nAct, be evidence in a court of law. Cases of the registration of false\r\nstatements have already been detected; some have been made with the view\r\nto successions and to the obtainment of property. False registrations\r\nhave been made amongst the labouring classes as to the place of death,\r\nto gain interments in distant parishes at cheaper rates. Fictitious\r\ndeaths have been registered to defraud burial societies, and the\r\nregistrar’s certificate of such deaths have got in use by vagrants as a\r\nmeans of obtaining alms. In Manchester a woman having obtained and used\r\none certificate of a fictitious death, soon after obtained another\r\nsimilar certificate, and in order to deter parties from visiting the\r\nhouse, she got the cause of death registered as “malignant fever.”\r\n\r\n§ 189. On the continent, wherever the mortuary registers are well kept,\r\nand arrangements are made for the protection of the public health, the\r\nfact and time of death, and the identity of the deceased, is verified on\r\nthe spot, by inspection of the body by a competent responsible officer\r\nof public health. Vide instance and effects at Geneva, stated in the\r\nGeneral Sanitary Report, p. 174.\r\n\r\n§ 190. It is proposed that the verification of the fact of death, and\r\nascertaining its cause, by inquiry on the spot, should be confided to\r\nthe officer proposed to be appointed as an officer of public health. The\r\npresent local registrars might act as auxiliaries; the proposed\r\nappointment would be an additional security for the accuracy of the\r\nmortuary registration, and would improve that branch of the local\r\nmachinery for registration.\r\n\r\nPostponing the consideration of other collateral grounds for the\r\nappointment of a district officer of health, and to illustrate more\r\nclearly the course of alteration of the practice of interments, we will\r\nsuppose the physician or officer of health brought by the proper notice\r\nto the habitation where the body lies in the presence of the survivors.\r\n\r\n§ 191. In visiting the habitations of the labouring classes, he would be\r\nmore careful to denote his office, profession, and condition, by his\r\ndress, and in his address, even than with other classes. On his arrival\r\nat the place of abode of a person of the working class, he would, after\r\nannouncing his office and duty, inspect the body, and then require the\r\nname, age, occupation, and circumstances of the death of the deceased,\r\nenter them, and take the attestations of witnesses present. If the death\r\noccurred from any ordinary cause, he would, nevertheless, speak of the\r\nexpediency of the early removal of the body to the chapel or house of\r\nreception, where it would be placed under proper care until the\r\nappointed time of the attendance of the relations and friends at the\r\ninterment. The exercise of a summary power of removal in the case of\r\nrapid decomposition of the corpse, or in case of deaths from epidemic\r\ndisease, for the protection of the living, is frequently suggested and\r\nclaimed by neighbours. On inquiry in Manchester as to the periods during\r\nwhich the bodies of persons dying in the poorest districts were retained\r\nin the rooms where they died, the superintendent-registrar, Mr.\r\nGardiner, observed, “they are not retained so long in these districts,\r\nbecause the houses to which the rooms belong are generally inhabited by\r\nseveral families, and those other families feel the inconvenience of the\r\nretention of the body amongst them, and they press for an early\r\ninterment.” With females or survivors who cannot endure to part with the\r\nremains, the exercise of a friendly will would sometimes be necessary,\r\nand if properly exercised would generally be effectual. The name of an\r\nofficer of public health would carry with it very general voluntary\r\nobedience to whatever he recommended, and in a majority of cases the\r\nprostrate survivors would be glad that he should order everything, and\r\nwould feel it a relief if he were to do so. He would be prepared with a\r\ntariff of the prices of burial, and with instructions as to the\r\nregulations adopted for the public convenience, and for the more\r\nrespectful performance of the ceremony of interment, and should be\r\nempowered and required, on the assent or application of the parties, to\r\ncarry them out completely, as he might do with very little inconvenience\r\nor expenditure of time. He might be empowered to take such a course as\r\nthis. Speaking to the widow or survivor of the lowest class, he might\r\nsay—\r\n\r\n“The inspectors of public health have been empowered to regulate the\r\npractice and the charges for interment, and to contract for and on\r\nbehalf of the public to ensure the means of burial in a proper and\r\nrespectful manner for the highest, as well as for the most humble\r\nclasses. Formerly, the charge for the funeral of a person of the\r\ncondition in life of your husband was four or five pounds, but by the\r\nnew regulations, an equally respectable interment is secured to you for\r\nlittle more than half the amount. You are, nevertheless, at liberty to\r\nobtain the means of burial from any private undertaker. You may also, if\r\nyou prefer it, have burial in any private cemetery, or elsewhere.”\r\n\r\n§ 192. It is anticipated that, except on private canvass, and that only\r\nfor a time, interment under the auspices of a public officer would be\r\npreferred in the great majority of cases, if the business were conducted\r\nwith moderate care, in a manner really satisfactory, and if the minor\r\nbut really important conveniences of all classes were duly consulted.\r\nFor example, one frequent cause of the delay of interments amongst the\r\npoorer classes in crowded districts, is the delay of notification of\r\ndeaths to distant relatives and friends, whose attendance may be\r\nrequired. More than one-half of the poor cannot write, and many of all\r\nclasses who can write are unable to collect their thoughts even for a\r\nsimple announcement of the event. The poorer classes generally get some\r\none to write for them; and the regular payment for each letter is\r\nfourpence and a glass of liquor, or sixpence, exclusive of paper and\r\npostage. In the charges for funerals of the labouring classes in\r\nScotland, five shillings is set down as the item of expense of letters\r\nof notification of the death of an artisan, and fifteen shillings for\r\nthe notifications of the deaths of persons of the middle ranks of life.\r\nUnder practicable regulations, such notifications might be prepared in a\r\nmanner suitable to persons of every condition, at the rate of threepence\r\nper letter, or at one-half the ordinary rate of payment, paper, and\r\nenvelope, and postage stamp included. The service might be rendered at\r\nan expense of a few minutes’ time to the officer in taking down a list\r\nof the names and addresses of the persons to be sent to. This list he\r\nwould on his return to his office, hand to a clerk, by whom they would\r\nbe immediately prepared and despatched in proper and well considered\r\nform. The Inspector might, therefore, add—\r\n\r\n“If you will give me the names and addresses of those relatives and\r\nfriends who may be desired to attend the funeral, I will cause notice of\r\nthe time and places of attendance to be sent to them. Amongst the\r\nhighest classes it is now the practice to diminish the number of\r\nfollowers to the grave, and to commit that duty only to a few; and it is\r\ndesirable, for the sake of preventing unnecessary expense, that too many\r\nshould not be invited. All the friends of the deceased who attend at the\r\nnational cemetery will have an opportunity of joining in with the\r\nprocession. Besides, the requests to attend, I can also, if you wish it,\r\nand will give me the names and addresses, cause notifications of the\r\nfact of the death to be sent to any persons in any part of the country.”\r\n\r\nIn the cases of illness amongst the survivors, or of a death from\r\nepidemic disease, indicating an infected atmosphere, he might add—\r\n\r\n“For the protection of your own health, and the health of your children\r\nand of your neighbours, it is requisite that the body be immediately\r\nremoved to a place where it will be kept under the care of a physician,\r\nand inspected until the appointed time of interment, when it will be\r\nreceived by the friends and relations who attend.”\r\n\r\n§ 193. It is considered that, in general, this course would be complied\r\nwith, but it is considered by physicians, that if it were found\r\nnecessary in the first instance, in the case of the poorest and most\r\nignorant and highly-excitable people, to concede the point, the officer\r\nmight give directions to have the body enclosed with cloth of a material\r\nto resist the immediate escape of effluvia, and to be closed down, which\r\nmight be done at a few shillings extra expense. Mr. R. Baker, the\r\nsurgeon, who has paid great attention to the means for the improvement\r\nof the sanitary condition of the population at Leeds, observes—\r\n\r\n  I believe that where persons die of epidemic diseases, there is not\r\n  much regard paid to the necessity of early interment. There is what\r\n  is called the making up of the body, which is often done very early\r\n  after death, and even in some cases of supposed contagion, before it\r\n  is absolutely necessary. But an application is used in coffins of\r\n  those whose friends can afford it which deserves naming, because it\r\n  is at once safe and economical, and renders any sanitary precautions\r\n  unnecessary, where there is a desire from any requisite family\r\n  arrangements to keep the body; it is to place the body in a deal\r\n  shell, and then to place this shell within the coffin, between which\r\n  and the shell are affixed at the sides and bottom, a few pieces of\r\n  circular wood about the thickness of two crown pieces, here and\r\n  there, to keep the shell and coffin apart, forming a considerable\r\n  interstice, which is filled in with boiling pitch. The lid of the\r\n  shell is then laid on, having a glass over the face, and over this\r\n  is poured more pitch till the shell is incased in a pitch coffin\r\n  between the wooden ones. The cost of this process, which is next to\r\n  that of embalming, is about 9_s._ 6_d._, and is easily paid out of\r\n  the seven or ten pounds which the club supplies. I would only add\r\n  that this experiment deserves well of every one’s consideration,\r\n  being far superior to lead, and equally useful, in all ordinary\r\n  interments, and admirable for the purpose of avoiding contagion,\r\n  while it admits the opportunity of keeping the body for any\r\n  arrangement that is required to be made. If this plan could be\r\n  enforced upon all occasions where death had occurred from contagious\r\n  disease, I look upon it, that a great benefit would be conferred\r\n  upon the community.\r\n\r\n§ 194. In the cases where decomposition, as sometimes occurs, commences\r\neven before death and proceeds with extreme rapidity after it, even an\r\nimmediate removal is not effected without producing depressing effects\r\non the bearers; and when there is an in-door church service, in some\r\ndistricts in the metropolis, it is not unfrequently necessary to have\r\nthe body left at the church door, on account of the extremely offensive\r\nsmell which escapes from the coffin. These coffins are generally\r\nconstructed without knowledge, or care, or adaptation to the\r\ncircumstances of the remains, or to any sanitary service. Mr. W. Dyce\r\nGuthrie, surgeon, who has paid much attention to some of the structural\r\nmeans for the protection of the public health, specifies various modes\r\nin which the evils arising before interment, as well as after, may be\r\nprevented, at a cost so inconsiderable as not to be sensibly felt, even\r\nby the poorest classes, and yet be as efficient as the most expensive\r\narrangements now in use. For example: “Coffins may,” he says, “be\r\nrendered perfectly impervious to the escape of all morbific matter, at\r\nan expense not exceeding 1_s._ 6_d._ or 2_s._ each, by coating the\r\ninterior over with a cement composed of lime, sand, and oil, which soon\r\nsets and becomes almost as hard and resisting as stone. Pitch, applied\r\nhot, would answer the same purpose as the compound I have mentioned, but\r\nit would be more expensive.” In the cases of such rapid decomposition as\r\nbursts leaden coffins, or renders “tapping” necessary, he recommends the\r\napplication, at a few shillings expense, of safety-tubes to the foot of\r\nthe coffin, so as to secure and carry away into a chimney flue, or a\r\ncurrent created by a chauffer, the mephitic matter. These are adduced as\r\ninstances of the detailed appliances of which the officer of health\r\nwould judge in each case on the spot and suggest to the survivors, and\r\nif necessary write directions, or a prescription, for their appliance.\r\n\r\n§ 195. A cause of the delay of interments might, it is stated, be\r\ndiminished by arrangements, under which coffins of every size being kept\r\nprepared, one might be brought to the house, with the name of the\r\ndeceased, and his obituary duly inscribed on a plate, in about one-third\r\nthe time that is now usually employed for the purpose. By this service,\r\nthe rapid progress of decomposition, and the escape of noxious effluvia\r\nwould be arrested.\r\n\r\n§ 196. Before leaving the abode of the deceased, the officer of health\r\nwould, in the case of death from diseases likely to have been originated\r\nor precipitated by local causes, inspect the premises, inquire closely\r\nas to the antecedent circumstances of the decease; and note directions\r\nto be given in respect to the premises to officers having charge of\r\ndrainage or sewerage, or public works, for cleansing and lime-washing\r\nthe premises, at the charge of the owner, before renewed occupation.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the poorest classes, those who stand the most in need of\r\nprotection: the measure of prohibiting burial, except on a verification\r\nof the fact and cause of death, by a certificate granted on the sight\r\nand identification of the body at the place where the death occurred,\r\nhas its chief importance as being the means of carrying a person of\r\neducation into places rarely, if ever entered, by them, except by\r\naccident. The functions of the officer of health when there are marked\r\nout by instances of acts done by force of humanity and charity, which as\r\nyet have no authority in law, or in administrative provision. For\r\nexample, in the following instance, of a house owned by a landlord of\r\nthe lowest class.\r\n\r\n  Shepherd’s-court consists of about six houses. It was notorious that\r\n  fever had prevailed to a great extent in this court; in the house in\r\n  question, several cases of fever had occurred in succession. The\r\n  house is small, contains four rooms,—two on the ground-floor and two\r\n  above; each of these rooms was let out to a separate family. On the\r\n  present occasion, in one of the rooms on the ground-floor there were\r\n  four persons ill of fever; in the other room, on the same floor,\r\n  there were, at the same time, three persons ill of fever; and in one\r\n  of the upper rooms there were also at the same time three persons\r\n  ill of fever; in the fourth room no one was ill at that time. It\r\n  appeared that different families had in succession occupied these\r\n  rooms, and become affected with fever; on the occasion in question,\r\n  all the sick were removed as soon as possible by the interference of\r\n  the parish officers. An order was made by the board of guardians to\r\n  take the case before the magistrates at Worship-street. The\r\n  magistrates at first refused to interfere, but the medical officer\r\n  stated that several cases of fever had occurred in succession in\r\n  this particular house; that one set of people had gone in, become\r\n  ill with fever, and were removed; that another set of people had\r\n  gone in, and been in like manner attacked with fever; that this had\r\n  occurred several times, and that it was positively known that this\r\n  house had been affected with fever for upwards of six weeks before\r\n  the present application was made. On hearing this, the magistrate\r\n  sent for the owner of the house, and remonstrated with him for\r\n  allowing different sets of people to occupy the rooms without\r\n  previously cleansing and whitewashing them; telling him that he was\r\n  committing a serious offence in allowing the nuisance to continue.\r\n  The magistrate further gave the house in charge to the medical\r\n  officer, authorizing him to see all the rooms properly fumigated,\r\n  and otherwise thoroughly cleansed; and said that, if any persons\r\n  entered the house before the medical officer said that the place was\r\n  fit to be inhabited, they would send an officer to turn them out, or\r\n  place an officer at the door to prevent their entrance. The landlord\r\n  became frightened, and allowed the house to be whitewashed,\r\n  fumigated, and thoroughly cleansed. Since this was done the rooms\r\n  have been occupied by a fresh set of people; but no case of fever\r\n  has occurred.[40]\r\n\r\nThis occurred seven years since, and on a very recent inquiry made at\r\nthis same house, it was stated that comparative cleanliness having been\r\nmaintained, no fever had since broken out, no more such deaths have been\r\noccasioned, no more burthens had been cast upon the poor’s rates from\r\nthis house. The law already authorizes the house to be condemned, and\r\nits use arrested, when it is in a condition to endanger life by falling;\r\nif it be deemed that the principle should be applied to all manifest\r\ncauses of disease or death, or danger to life, then, instead of the\r\nremote and practically useless remedy by the inspection of an unskilled\r\nand unqualified ward inquest (Vide General Sanitary Report, p. 300), the\r\nskilled and responsible medical officer, with such summary powers and\r\nduties of immediate interference, as were successfully exercised in the\r\ncase above cited, should be appointed.\r\n\r\n§ 197. It is proper to observe, that it occurs not unfrequently that\r\nsuch scenes arise from negligences and dilapidations of a succession of\r\nbad tenants, of which the chief landlord is himself unaware: but whether\r\naware of it or not, the prompt intervention of an officer of health in\r\nsuch cases would not be without its compensation to the owner. A\r\nbricklayer, who himself owned some small houses occupied by artisans,\r\nwhich he had himself built, was asked in the course of another inquiry:—\r\n\r\n  In what periods do you collect the rents?—Some monthly; about\r\n  one-third monthly; the rest we collect quarterly.\r\n\r\n  What may be your losses on the collections?—They will average,\r\n  perhaps, about one-fifth; we lose rather the most on the quarterly\r\n  tenements.\r\n\r\n  What are the chief causes of your losses from this class of\r\n  tenants?—Loss of work first; then sickness and death; then frauds.\r\n\r\n  Are the frauds considerable?—Not so much as the inabilities to pay.\r\n  I find the working classes, if they have means, as willing to pay\r\n  and as honourable as any other class. Within the last 18 months\r\n  there have been a great many people out of work; at other times\r\n  there is as much loss to the landlord from sickness as from any\r\n  other cause. Three out of five of the losses of rent that I now\r\n  have, are losses from the sickness of the tenants, who are working\r\n  men.\r\n\r\n  When children are sick, there is of course no immediate interruption\r\n  to the payment of rent?—Very seldom.\r\n\r\n  What sort of sicknesses are they from which the interruption to work\r\n  and to the payment of rent occurs?—Fevers, nervous disorders, and\r\n  sickness that debilitates them.\r\n\r\n  Then anything which promotes the health of the tenants will tend to\r\n  prevent losses of rent to the owners of the lower class of\r\n  houses?—Yes, I have decidedly found that rent is the best got from\r\n  healthy houses.\r\n\r\nIn some of the cellar dwellings in Manchester the losses of rent,\r\nchiefly from sickness, amounted to 20 per cent.\r\n\r\n§ 198. In all cases of deaths from epidemic diseases, one of the first\r\nduties of the officer of health would be to inquire whether there were\r\nany other persons in the house attacked with disease, and examine them.\r\nIn all such cases as those cited, §§ 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, he should\r\nhave adequate power, which, that it may be efficient must be summary, to\r\ntake measures to protect the parties affected and others, by ordering\r\ntheir immediate removal to fever wards. It is only in a deplorable state\r\nof ignorance of the nature of the evils which depress such districts\r\nthat there could be any hesitation in granting such powers from the fear\r\nof abuse; the most serious legislative difficulty would be to ensure\r\ntheir constant and efficient application. Mr. S. Holmes, the builder of\r\nthe Stockport viaduct, and formerly an active member of the Liverpool\r\ntown council, gives the following illustration of the extreme miseries\r\nwitnessed in that town, and it is certainly not an exaggerated\r\ndescription of the scenes to which the officer of health must at the\r\ncommencement of his duties be frequently carried on the occurrence of\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\n  The melancholy facts elicited by the corporation clearly show that\r\n  Liverpool contains a multitude of inhabited cellars, close and damp,\r\n  with no drain nor any convenience, and these pest-houses are\r\n  constantly filled with fever. Some time ago I visited a poor woman\r\n  in distress, the wife of a labouring man. She had been confined only\r\n  a few days, and herself and infant were lying on straw in a vault\r\n  through the outer cellar, with a clay floor, impervious to water.\r\n  There was no light nor ventilation in it, and the air was dreadful.\r\n  I had to walk on bricks across the floor to reach her bed-side, as\r\n  the floor itself was flooded with stagnant water. This is by no\r\n  means an extraordinary case, for I have witnessed scenes equally\r\n  wretched; and it is only necessary to go into Crosby-street,\r\n  Freemasons’-row, and many cross streets out of Vauxhall-road, to\r\n  find hordes of poor creatures living in cellars, which are almost as\r\n  bad and offensive as charnel-houses. In Freemasons’-row, about two\r\n  years ago, a court of houses, the floors of which were below the\r\n  public street, and the area of the whole court, was a floating mass\r\n  of putrified animal and vegetable matter, so dreadfully offensive\r\n  that I was obliged to make a precipitate retreat. Yet the whole of\r\n  the houses were inhabited!\r\n\r\n§ 199. In cases of epidemics the saving of life by the prompt\r\nintervention of an officer of health, on the occurrence of the first\r\ndeath, and the immediate removal of the survivors affected, would be\r\nvery considerable. In cases of fever, on the removal of patients to the\r\nfever hospital, they are often received in a state of violent delirium,\r\nor in a state of coma succeeding to violent delirium. After they have\r\nbeen washed in a bath, and placed in a clean bed, in the spacious and\r\nwell-ventilated ward of the hospital, in a few hours, often before the\r\nvisit of the physician, the violent delirium has subsided, or the state\r\nof coma having passed away consciousness has returned. Although in a\r\ngreat majority of cases the patients are only sent to the hospital in\r\nthe last stage of disease, this mere change in the locality and external\r\ncircumstances of the sufferers diminishes the proportion of deaths from\r\none in five to one in seven. Supposing the cases occurred in equal\r\nnumbers daily, the functions of registration in the metropolis would\r\ncarry the officers of health to upwards of 20 cases per diem of deaths\r\nfrom epidemic disease, for the most part in the most wretched districts.\r\n\r\n§ 200. The principle of this part of the proposed arrangement is in\r\nnecessitating visits of inspection, and thence necessitating the\r\ninitiation of measures of relief where there has hitherto been, and\r\nwhence it may safely be said there will be, no complaint or initiation\r\nof measures of relief by the sufferers themselves. It is observed by Dr.\r\nSouthwood Smith, in confirmation of the observations made on the\r\ndemoralizing effects of the physical evils which depress the bodily\r\ncondition of large classes that, as they have not the bodily vigour, so\r\nthey have not the intelligence of a healthy class. One of the most\r\nmelancholy proofs of this, he observes, is, that they make no effort to\r\nget into happier circumstances; their dulness and apathy indicate an\r\nequal degree of mental as of physical paralysis. And this has struck\r\nother observers who have had opportunities of becoming acquainted with\r\nthe real state of these people. “The following statement impressed my\r\nmind the more, because it recalled to my recollection vividly similar\r\ncases witnessed by myself. ‘In the year 1836,’ says one of the medical\r\nofficers of the West Derby Union, ‘I attended a family of thirteen,\r\ntwelve of whom had typhus fever,—without a bed in the cellar, without\r\nstraw or timber shavings—frequent substitutes. They lay on the floor,\r\nand so crowded that I could scarcely pass between them. In another house\r\nI attended fourteen patients: there were only two beds in the house. All\r\nthe patients lay on the boards, and during their illness never had their\r\nclothes off. I met with many cases in similar conditions; yet amidst the\r\ngreatest destitution and want of domestic comfort, _I have never heard,\r\nduring the course of twelve years’ practice, a complaint of inconvenient\r\naccommodation_.’ Now this want of complaint, under such circumstances,\r\nappears to me to constitute a very melancholy part of this condition. It\r\nshows that physical wretchedness has done its worst on the human\r\nsufferer, for it has destroyed his mind. The wretchedness being greater\r\nthan humanity can bear, annihilates the mental faculties—the faculties\r\ndistinctive of the human being. There is a kind of satisfaction in the\r\nthought, for it sets a limit to the capacity of suffering which would\r\notherwise be without bound.”\r\n\r\n§ 201. In respect to any such services proposed, involving inquiry on\r\nthe spot, an objection is apt to be suggested, that the exercise of such\r\nfunctions would be unpopular and objected to. By the sufferers it\r\ncertainly would not, § 122. With portions of the population, in such a\r\ndeplorable state of ignorance as that manifested, even in this country,\r\nat the time of the invasion of the cholera, when they imbibed the notion\r\nthat the wells had been poisoned by the medical men, the creation of any\r\nmonstrous impressions by others must be admitted to be possible; but the\r\nexistence of that notion would have been no justification for closing\r\nthe hospitals, for staying the work of beneficence, and suspending the\r\nperformance of medical duties. Such an objection, however, implies a\r\nvery large misconception as to the _general_ state of intelligence of\r\nthe working classes. There is, on this point, as regards the metropolis,\r\nthe direct and decisive evidence of experience. In consequence of the\r\ndifficulty of dealing satisfactorily with common hearsay evidence, some\r\nof the local registrars have, with praiseworthy care, proceeded to\r\nverify the facts of the death by inquiries made at the house where it\r\ntook place, which inquiries are strictly supererogatory. The following\r\nevidence, though in part substantially a repetition of scenes already\r\ndescribed, is here adduced less for the descriptions of places visited\r\nthan as showing the manner in which these officers were received.\r\n\r\nMr. James Murray, the registrar of births, deaths, and marriages for the\r\nHackney Road district of Bethnal Green, having stated that sometimes he\r\nmade inquiries on the spot for the registration of deaths, speaking of\r\nthe poorer population of that district, states that they have usually\r\nonly a single room, and that “they never speak of occupying the same\r\nhouse, but the ‘same room.’”\r\n\r\n  In what proportion of cases do the bodies of those persons remain in\r\n  the room in which the persons live and sleep?—It would depend upon\r\n  the part of the district, for part of the higher district is highly\r\n  respectable. In that district nine-tenths of them have only a single\r\n  room, and no opportunity of placing the body elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  In nine-tenths of the cases the body remains in the same room?—It\r\n  must be so, they have no other room.\r\n\r\n  In a coffin?—Yes; I have seen it so repeatedly.\r\n\r\n  Is the retention of the body injurious?—I think so.\r\n\r\n  When you go to register the deaths is it deemed an intrusion, or are\r\n  you received with civility?—I am always received with civility in\r\n  all cases.\r\n\r\n  It is not considered an intrusion?—Not at all. I myself have rather\r\n  cultivated the good feeling and opinion of the working classes; they\r\n  know me exceedingly well, and I have never met with any instance of\r\n  incivility among them.\r\n\r\nMr. John Johnson, the registrar of one part of the Shoreditch district,\r\nwas asked—\r\n\r\n  Of the labouring classes, what proportion of the families have more\r\n  than two rooms?—I cannot say the number; but there is a vast number\r\n  who occupy one room, and some occupy two rooms; some occupy a\r\n  kitchen and one room, or a little parlour and kitchen, and some two\r\n  rooms up-stairs, some one room; perhaps if they have two rooms\r\n  up-stairs they have a family in each.\r\n\r\n  Do you find, on visiting those places, upon the occurrence of a\r\n  death, that the dead body is retained in the living and sleeping\r\n  room?—Frequently we find it so.\r\n\r\n  And the family are eating and pursuing the ordinary offices of life\r\n  in the room where the body lies?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  Have you found the body retained for a long time?—No, they do not\r\n  usually keep it longer than five or six days; but I have known\r\n  instances where the body has been kept two and three weeks.\r\n\r\n  But in that time does it not acquire a putrid smell?—Yes, and in\r\n  rooms where I have gone to register births I have found the effluvia\r\n  so bad that I have been obliged to go out of the house without\r\n  effecting the register.\r\n\r\n  It had an effect upon your health for the time being?—Yes.\r\n\r\n  When you go to register deaths at the houses of the labouring\r\n  classes, are you on the whole well received?—Generally very well;\r\n  they consider we pay them a compliment by calling upon them.\r\n\r\n  They do not deem your registration or inquiry an intrusion?—Not at\r\n  all.\r\n\r\nMr. W. H. Wheatley, the registrar for the Old Church district of\r\nLambeth, was asked—\r\n\r\n  You think it necessary, in order to ascertain the causes of death\r\n  with correctness, to go to the spot and ascertain the fact on the\r\n  spot?—Yes: I get much more correct information in that way than from\r\n  parties calling upon me.\r\n\r\n  If you were to remain at your desk, without local inquiry, do you\r\n  conceive your registration would be at all correct, or would it not\r\n  be widely different from the fact?—I do not think it would be\r\n  correct. I think in every case of death the registrar ought to go to\r\n  the house, not only for the purpose of registering the death, but\r\n  that there ought to be some means of ascertaining from what cause\r\n  the party died; that the body ought to be seen by the registrar, or\r\n  some authorized person, or that it should be compulsory to produce a\r\n  medical certificate, certifying the precise cause of death. The\r\n  searchers, who were two women, appointed in open vestry, under an\r\n  old Act of Parliament, to call and investigate every case of death\r\n  that occurred, and to examine the body and see that the party had\r\n  come fairly by his or her death, have been done away with since the\r\n  passing of the Registration Act, and there is now no means of\r\n  ascertaining how the party has met with his death.\r\n\r\n  Can you state to the Commissioners instances of error which you have\r\n  obviated or prevented by going and inquiring upon the spot, that\r\n  would have occurred by your not going?—I cannot mention individual\r\n  cases; but it has come under my knowledge that parties have called\r\n  upon me to register a death, and when I have asked the cause they\r\n  have said, “I do not exactly know what it was, I believe it was a\r\n  fever, or something of that kind.” I have said, “I must trouble you\r\n  to get me a medical certificate, or I will call at the house.” I\r\n  have gone to the house, and found it widely different in many cases\r\n  from the statement they gave to me, from error on their parts.\r\n\r\n  Are you satisfied from the experience of your office, though it has\r\n  been short, that there can be no correct registration without\r\n  examination on the spot, and a sight of the body?—I think so; it\r\n  would entail upon the registrars a very arduous and a very\r\n  unpleasant office, but that the registration would be more perfect,\r\n  and it would be a check upon crime, I have very little doubt.\r\n\r\n  Do you find any obstruction given on the part of the poorer classes\r\n  to your going to the spot and making inquiries?—Not the slightest.\r\n  My opinion is that the poorer classes pay more attention to the\r\n  registration than the middling classes.\r\n\r\n  Have you met with any manifestation of prejudice or bad feeling from\r\n  the poorer classes?—No, not the slightest, but really a wish that\r\n  the registration should be effective.\r\n\r\n  They do not view the registrar as an intrusive officer?—Not in the\r\n  least.\r\n\r\nIn the worst conditioned places the only persons who are seen as public\r\nofficers are policemen and the rate-collectors or the tax-gatherers.\r\nWhen commissioners of inquiry have been seen taking notes in them, the\r\npopular impression was that they were tax-gatherers, an impression which\r\nit required some trouble to remove. In a little time the officer of\r\nhealth would be most popular and would exercise extensive and beneficial\r\ninfluence. The practical evidence of the registrars was of an uniform\r\ntenor, establishing, as far as actual experience may establish, not only\r\nthe acceptability of the more elevated and extensive service proposed,\r\nbut that it must develope most important civil as well as medical facts,\r\nthe correct knowledge of which is necessary for the relief of the most\r\nafflicted portions of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Jurisprudential value of the appointment of Officers of Health._\r\n\r\n§ 202. In the lamentable state of the population, which in England and\r\nWales produces annually upwards of 700 committals to prison for crimes\r\nof passion, and of these 450 for murder, manslaughter, and attempts upon\r\nlife, it may scarcely be deemed necessary to adduce many particular\r\nexamples of the importance of the extraordinary jurisprudential services\r\nand securities for life to the community obtainable by the exercise in\r\nall cases of the ordinary functions of the verification, as far as may\r\nbe, of the fact as well as the cause of death. On examining the grounds\r\nof the fears of life and suspicions of the poorer classes, inhabiting\r\nthe worst conditioned districts, it is evident that obstructions to\r\ncrime, or safeguards, which are carefully preserved in the well\r\nregulated communities (marked by security of life and the rarity of\r\ncrimes of violence) are here absent, and that wide openings are left for\r\nthe escape of the darkest crimes. Had there been an officer of public\r\nhealth, and a verification of the cause of death by him on inspection,\r\nas at Geneva, Munich, or other towns on the continent, and inquiry for\r\nregistration of the causes of death, it is probable that, with the\r\ncertainty of such inspection, the murders of the children at Stockport\r\nor at Little Bolton would not have been attempted; or, if perpetrated,\r\nthey might have been detected in the first case. The whole class of\r\nmurders verified on examination after disinterment may be cited as\r\ncoming within the same category. The crime of burking, which appears to\r\nhave originated in Scotland, and was extended to England, could scarcely\r\nhave been attempted systematically, except under the temptation of the\r\nabsence of such a security; and with such service as that proposed, it\r\nis highly improbable that it could have been carried on to the extent\r\nthere is reason to believe it was.\r\n\r\nOn this point Mr. Corder, the superintendent registrar of the Strand\r\nUnion, gives important testimony.\r\n\r\n  From your knowledge of the actual state of much of the population in\r\n  the worst part of the metropolis, derived from your experience in\r\n  the several local offices you have held, and especially your\r\n  experience as a superintendent registrar, do you believe that the\r\n  inspection of the body to verify the fact of death, and, as far as\r\n  inspection and inquiry on the spot may do so, to determine the cause\r\n  of death, would be important securities not merely for the truth of\r\n  the registration, but valuable securities for life itself?—Most\r\n  certainly I do. Had there been such an inspection and verification\r\n  prior to the year 1831, the horrible system of destroying human\r\n  beings for the purpose of selling their bodies could not have been\r\n  carried on to the extent to which I know it existed at that period.\r\n  Being then the vestry clerk of St. Paul, Covent Garden, the officers\r\n  of which were bound over to prosecute Bishop, Williams, and May, for\r\n  the murder of the Italian boy, the duty of conducting the\r\n  prosecution entirely devolved upon me. In the course of my\r\n  inquiries, I elicited beyond all doubt that the practice of burking,\r\n  as it was then called, had prevailed to a considerable extent in the\r\n  metropolis.\r\n\r\n  Would inspection, do you conceive, and proper inquiry as to the\r\n  cause of death, have prevented such murders?—Most effectually so, I\r\n  conceive. I may mention that they took out the teeth of the younger\r\n  subjects, and sold them to the dentists. The Italian boy, it would\r\n  have been seen, had no teeth; the teeth had been punched out in such\r\n  a manner as to have been remarkable.\r\n\r\n  Though the motives to such dreadful practices are removed under the\r\n  securities for the public safety imposed in connexion with the\r\n  Anatomy Act, yet in cases of other attempts against life, do you\r\n  consider that the requiring a certificate of the fact of death,\r\n  verified on inspection before burial, would interpose useful\r\n  practical obstacles for the prevention of murder, and the protection\r\n  of life?—Most assuredly.\r\n\r\nMr. Partridge, the surgeon of King’s College, at whose instance the\r\nmurderers were taken into custody, in the cases referred to, expresses a\r\nsimilar opinion as to the importance of the proposed verification of the\r\nfact and cause of death by a proper officer.\r\n\r\n§ 203. It may here be stated that only a small proportion of the local\r\nregistrars are either medical officers or members of the medical\r\nprofession; but the short experience of those registrars who have those\r\nqualifications has elicited abundant indications of the extent to which\r\nproper securities are wanting for the protection of life in this\r\ncountry. Nearly all who have for any length of time exercised their\r\nfunctions have had occasion to arrest cases of _primâ facie_ suspicion\r\non the way to interment that had escaped the only existing security and\r\ninitiative to investigation, the suspicion of neighbours and popular\r\nrumour. Mr. Abraham, surgeon and registrar of deaths in the City of\r\nLondon Union, was asked on this subject—\r\n\r\n  You are Registrar of Deaths in the City of London Union. Since you\r\n  have been Registrar, have you had occasion to send notice to the\r\n  coroner of cases where the causes of death stated appeared\r\n  suspicious?—Yes, in about half-a-dozen cases. One was of an old\r\n  gentleman occupying apartments in Bell Alley. His servant went out\r\n  to market, and on her return, in less than an hour, found him dead\r\n  on the bed, with his legs lying over the side of it. He had been\r\n  ailing some time, and was seized occasionally with difficulty of\r\n  breathing, but able to get up, and when she left him she did not\r\n  perceive anything unusual in his appearance. I went to the house\r\n  myself, and made inquiries into the cause of death; and although I\r\n  did not discover anything to lead to the suspicion of his having\r\n  died from poison or other unfair means, I considered it involved in\r\n  obscurity, and referred the case to the coroner for investigation.\r\n  Another case was of a traveller who was found dead in his bed at an\r\n  inn. The body was removed to a distance of forty miles before a\r\n  certificate to authorize the burial was applied for. His usual\r\n  medical attendant certified to his having been for several years the\r\n  subject of aortic aneurism, which was the probable cause of his\r\n  sudden death, although the evidence was imperfect and\r\n  unsatisfactory, and could not be otherwise without an examination of\r\n  the body, and I therefore refused to register it without notice from\r\n  the coroner.\r\n\r\n  A third case occurred a few days ago. A medical certificate was\r\n  presented to me of the death of a man from disease of the heart and\r\n  aneurism of the aorta. He was driven in a cab to the door of a\r\n  medical practitioner in this neighbourhood, and was found dead. He\r\n  might have died from poison, and, without the questions put on the\r\n  occasion of registering the cause of death, the case might have\r\n  passed without notice. There was not in this case, as in others, any\r\n  evidence to show that death was occasioned by unfair means, but the\r\n  causes were obscure and unsatisfactory, and I felt it to be my duty\r\n  to have them investigated by the coroner.\r\n\r\n  But for anything known, you may have passed cases of\r\n  murder?—Certainly; and there is at present no security against such\r\n  cases. The personal inspection of the deceased would undoubtedly act\r\n  as a great security.\r\n\r\nMr. P. H. Holland, surgeon, registrar for Chorlton-on-Medlock:—\r\n\r\n  My district is of the better description, inhabited either by the\r\n  higher classes or by respectable working men, in which cases of\r\n  deaths from crime are not very likely to occur; yet suspicious cases\r\n  have from time to time happened (say six or eight annually in my\r\n  district), to which I have thought it necessary to call the\r\n  attention of the coroner. In one case, for example, a father, a\r\n  labouring man, came to me to report the death of his infant child,\r\n  stating the cause to be sickness and purging; there was then no\r\n  cholera prevalent, and the rapidity of the disease was unusually\r\n  great. My suspicion was excited as to the cause of the death, of\r\n  which the father could give no clear account, and I sent word to the\r\n  coroner that I thought the case was one which required inquiry. An\r\n  inquest was held, and it turned out that the child had taken\r\n  arsenic. The jury were of opinion that the death was entirely\r\n  accidental,—that there had been no criminal intention. Had not the\r\n  cause of the accident been developed by the inquiry, others of the\r\n  family might have suffered in the same way. The other cases, which\r\n  had escaped inquiry, have been chiefly those of accident, in which\r\n  the death occurred at long periods subsequently, such as five or six\r\n  weeks. I have found that it is a common practice to represent\r\n  children as “still-born,” who were born alive, it not being\r\n  necessary to register still-born children. By passing them off as\r\n  still-born, burial is obtained for a smaller fee. But by this means\r\n  cases of infanticide might be concealed. The fact of a married woman\r\n  having been pregnant, and no proof existing as to the issue may\r\n  hereafter be of legal importance. I have heard of many suspected\r\n  cases of the wilful neglect of children, on whose deaths sums were\r\n  obtainable from different burial societies. I cannot doubt that by\r\n  inquiring much infantile death, which occurs from ignorance and\r\n  incorrect treatment, would be prevented.\r\n\r\n  Inspection on the spot would, I consider, operate much more\r\n  powerfully in prevention than in detection of crime. It would also\r\n  occasion the stoppage of many existing but unsuspected causes of\r\n  death. I have had reason to believe in the existence of a large\r\n  amount of the preventible causes of death, with respect to which I\r\n  have had no means of inquiry.\r\n\r\n  I was, during four years, apothecary to the Chorlton-on-Medlock\r\n  Dispensary, during which time cases of sickness occurring in houses\r\n  unfit for healthful habitation were constantly coming under my\r\n  observation; many particular localities, affording far more than\r\n  their due proportion of disease, owing to imperfect drainage and\r\n  ventilation. Any one who had gone to inspect the body on the\r\n  occurrence of death in those places, with powers to enforce sanitary\r\n  measures, such as the removal of the survivors, the drainage and\r\n  cleansing and ventilation of the premises, would, undoubtedly, have\r\n  had the means of preventing much mortality.\r\n\r\n§ 204. Mr. Leigh, the surgeon, whose testimony has already been cited,\r\nacts as one of the registrars of Manchester, and adverts to one source\r\nof mortality amongst infants which appears to be widely extended in the\r\ntown districts. It is a practice with mothers who go to work to leave\r\ntheir children in the care of the cheapest nurses, who commonly neglect\r\nthe infants, and have recourse to Dalby’s Carminative in large\r\nquantities to quiet them. It is his opinion that a large number of them\r\nfall a sacrifice to this and other improper modes of treatment. For\r\nexample, says Mr. Leigh,\r\n\r\n  There is one evil of the extent of whose existence I had no\r\n  conception, till I had for some time held the office of registrar.\r\n  In decrying this, I would beg distinctly to disavow any private\r\n  professional feeling. I allude to the great number of cases in which\r\n  either no medical treatment at all, or what is nearly as bad,\r\n  improper medical treatment, had been resorted to. I think, in nearly\r\n  one-fourth of the deaths of infants reported to me, on inquiry I\r\n  find that the little patients had been attended by incompetent and\r\n  unqualified practitioners, chiefly retail druggists. Cases of croup\r\n  and inflammation of the lungs which are eminently benefited by\r\n  medical treatment, and in which prompt and decisive measures often\r\n  preserve life, are treated by them, and I have reason to know by\r\n  inquiry into the details of the cases that bleedings, calomel, and\r\n  the remedies absolutely requisite in such cases are never, or very\r\n  rarely, employed, whereas, under proper medical treatment, most of\r\n  such cases would recover. Under these circumstances, these men\r\n  themselves become fertile sources of mortality to the young.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent communication, he states—\r\n\r\n  I find that in the month of January just passed I registered the\r\n  deaths of 33 children under 4 years of age, of these 9 were attended\r\n  by druggists; I believe all by one who has received no medical\r\n  education: this is at the rate of 108 per annum. Three of the\r\n  children had no assistance at all, making 12 out of 33 that might\r\n  possibly have been saved. This number 33, however, is below the\r\n  average of the year, for in the three months preceding there died in\r\n  the district, of children under 4 years, 133, or 44 per month; and\r\n  during the quarter ending 30th September, 1842, 169, or 56 per\r\n  month; and the general number of those having no attendance, or\r\n  being attended by druggists, is fully one-third, so that 100 per\r\n  annum is much below the truth. I some time ago requested Mr. Bennet,\r\n  the registrar for the Ancoats district, to make similar notes on the\r\n  cases reported to him, and on inquiry from him I have reason to\r\n  believe that the evil exists to as great an extent in his district\r\n  as in mine.\r\n\r\n  I find that in most of the cases no efficient medical treatment was\r\n  adopted. Cases of pneumonia are seldom or never bled, or proper\r\n  remedies applied: the disease is probably not recognized, and if it\r\n  were, the treatment and extent to which it should be pursued is not\r\n  known to the parties prescribing.\r\n\r\nA similar practice appears to be prevalent also in the mining districts\r\nof Staffordshire and Shropshire. (Vide Reports of the Sub-Commissioners\r\nfor inquiring into employment in Mines, vol. I., pp. 22, 23; articles\r\n182–6; and pp. 38, 39; pp. 305 to 315, and the recent report respecting\r\nthe employment of children at Nottingham.) In the course of some recent\r\ninquiries by Dr. Lyon Playfair he found the increasing sale of opium in\r\nthe manufacturing towns was ascribable to the increasing use of it in\r\nthe form of carminative, or as it was named “quietness” for children,\r\nand that the consumption of opium by adults had diminished. On inquiring\r\nfrom the druggists who sold the opium what was the cause of the\r\ndiminished consumption by the adults, the uniform answer was, the\r\n“distress of the times,” which compelled them to dispense with luxuries.\r\nHe however ascertained clearly that from this terrible practice great\r\nnumbers of children perish, sometimes suddenly from an overdose, but\r\nmore commonly slowly, painfully, and insidiously. He was struck,\r\nhowever, with the fact of the increased proportions and rapidity of the\r\nbirths in the places where this infantile mortality was prevalent. It\r\nwas remarked by the people themselves. So that there was no diminution\r\nof the numbers of children, but a woeful diminution of their strength\r\nand a proportionate increase of their burdensomeness. Those who escaped\r\nwith life, became pale and sickly children, and it was very long before\r\nthey overcame the effects arising from the pernicious practice; if\r\nindeed they ever did do so.[41]\r\n\r\nThe most serious consequences, arise from the omission of proper\r\nadministrative securities for the safety of life in Scotland. On these\r\nDr. Scott Alison states:—\r\n\r\n  In Scotland there is full opportunity for the perpetration of murder\r\n  and burial without investigation by any responsible officer. There\r\n  is no coroner and no inquest. I have known cases of the occurrence\r\n  of deaths from culpable negligence, to say the least of it, which\r\n  required public proceedings to be taken, but where interment took\r\n  place without the slightest notice. I had myself a young man of\r\n  about 20 years of age under treatment who, in my opinion, died from\r\n  culpable maltreatment whilst in prison. He had in a drunken frolic\r\n  committed an assault, and was imprisoned in a damp cold cell without\r\n  a fire. He certainly died of disease which was very likely to be\r\n  produced by the cold which he then endured, and to which he ascribed\r\n  it. Before his imprisonment he was a remarkably strong, fine healthy\r\n  man. No inquiry was made or thought of in the case. I have known\r\n  several cases, and they were not uncommon. I remember two, within\r\n  two or three days, of children having been overlaid and killed by\r\n  their parents when in a state of drunkenness. They were buried\r\n  without any notice being taken of the circumstance by any party,\r\n  though if punishment were not inflicted upon them public notice\r\n  would have been of importance for the sake of the morals of the\r\n  population.\r\n\r\n  I have known deaths of grown up people from burning when in a state\r\n  of intoxication, and deaths from intoxication take place without\r\n  inquiry; also deaths from accidents, such as falling into coal pits,\r\n  deaths from machinery, as to which in many cases no public inquiry\r\n  whatsoever was ever made. I have known cases of children burned to\r\n  death who were left without any care. It was a common case in\r\n  Tranent for persons to drink for a wager who would drink most. I\r\n  know of the case of three tradesmen who drank for a wager; two of\r\n  them died within a few days, and the widow of one of them committed\r\n  suicide shortly afterwards; and I was informed that they were all\r\n  buried without any notice being taken of the fact. There is\r\n  certainly a facility for the perpetration of murder in Scotland from\r\n  the absence of securities, and for protection of life against\r\n  culpable negligence. The visits of an officer of public health would\r\n  be of very great utility.\r\n\r\nMr. William Chambers observes:—\r\n\r\n  It seems to me not a little surprising that in Scotland, which is\r\n  signalized for its general intelligence, love of order, and I may\r\n  add really beneficent laws, the country should be so far behind in\r\n  everything connected with vital statistics. I have already noticed\r\n  that it possesses no coroner’s inquest. This is a positive disgrace.\r\n  Deaths are continually occurring from violence, but of which not the\r\n  slightest notice is taken by procurators fiscal, magistrates, or\r\n  police; indeed, these functionaries seldom interfere except when a\r\n  positive complaint is lodged. Some time ago, the medical gentleman\r\n  who attends my family, mentioned to me incidentally that that\r\n  morning he had been called to look at, and if possible recover, a\r\n  lady who had been found hanging in her bed-room. His efforts were\r\n  ineffectual; the lady was stone dead; and it was announced by her\r\n  relatives that she had died suddenly. In the usual course of things,\r\n  she was buried. Now, in this case, not the slightest inquiry was\r\n  made by any public officer, and whether it was a death from suicide\r\n  or from murder nobody can tell. The procurator fiscal, whose duty it\r\n  is to take cognizance of such deaths, is, of course, not to blame,\r\n  for he has not the faculty of omniscience.\r\n\r\nThe preventive and detective functions of the officer of health would be\r\nthe more efficient from the exercise of any such functions being\r\nincidental to ordinary functions of acknowledged every day importance,\r\nwhich must lead his visits and inspection to be regarded as _primâ\r\nfacie_ services of beneficence and kindness to all who surround the\r\ndeceased. The comparative inefficiency of officers whose functions are\r\nprincipally judiciary is well exemplified in some remarks made by Mr.\r\nHill Burton, Advocate, in a communication on the subject of interments\r\nin Scotland.\r\n\r\n  A prominent defect (as he observes) in the means of inquiry into the\r\n  causes of death in Scotland consists in the circumstance that before\r\n  any investigation can be entered on there must be ostensible reasons\r\n  for presuming the existence of violence and crime. On the occasion\r\n  of a death having occurred in circumstances out of the ordinary\r\n  course, the only person authorized to make any inquiry as to its\r\n  cause is the officer whose proper and ostensible duty it is to\r\n  prosecute to conviction. It hence arises that the simple institution\r\n  of an inquiry is almost equivalent to a charge of crime, and that\r\n  the proper officer, knowing the serious position in which he places\r\n  those concerned, by taking any steps, is very reluctant to move,\r\n  until the public voice has pretty unequivocally shown him that the\r\n  matter comes within his province as a public prosecutor. There is no\r\n  family in Scotland that would not at present feel a demand by a\r\n  Procurator Fiscal, or by any individual to inspect a body within\r\n  their house, as very nearly equivalent to a charge of murder; and I\r\n  should think it is of very rare occurrence, that any such inspection\r\n  takes place, in a private house, unless when a prosecution has been\r\n  decided on.\r\n\r\n  The absence of any machinery, through which an inquiry can be calmly\r\n  and impartially made into the cause of death, without in itself\r\n  implying suspicion of crime, is frequently illustrated in the\r\n  creation of excitement and alarm in the public mind, which the\r\n  authorities cannot find a suitable means of allaying. I remember\r\n  some years ago being present at a trial for murder, which, as it\r\n  involved no point in law, has unfortunately not been reported. It\r\n  was a trial undertaken by the Crown for the mere purpose of\r\n  justifying an innocent man. Two butchers were returning tipsy from a\r\n  fair; some words arose between them, and soon after, one of them was\r\n  found stabbed to the heart by one of the set of knives which both\r\n  carried. On investigation, it appeared that the deceased had fallen\r\n  on his side, from the effects of drunkenness, and that one of the\r\n  knives which hung at his side, dropping perpendicularly with its\r\n  heavy handle to the ground, pierced through his ribs to his heart as\r\n  he fell. It was impossible, however, to satisfy the public that such\r\n  was the case. The feeling of the neighbourhood ran high, and the\r\n  Crown was induced, out of humanity, or from a desire to preserve the\r\n  public peace, to concede the formality of a trial. I know it to be\r\n  of the most frequent occurrence, especially in the north of\r\n  Scotland, that suspicions which must be destructive to the peace of\r\n  mind of those who are the objects of them, take wing through\r\n  society, and can never be set effectually at rest.\r\n\r\n§ 205. Mr. W. Dyce Guthrie, after reciting several cases of strong\r\nsuspicion which came under his observation whilst acting as a medical\r\npractitioner in Scotland concludes by observing—\r\n\r\n  Whether on an inquest before a coroner the real truth would have\r\n  been elicited I cannot determine, but I think there can be but one\r\n  opinion as to the propriety of having all obstacles removed which\r\n  may presently stand in the way of arriving at the truth of all\r\n  circumstances connected with sudden and suspicious deaths. Were it\r\n  necessary, I could cite many instances of sudden deaths attended by\r\n  circumstances of such a nature as not only rendered an investigation\r\n  highly proper in a legal point of view, but necessary in charity to\r\n  those individuals whose characters were tarnished by the cruelly\r\n  unjust insinuations of some black-hearted enemies. The business not\r\n  having been thoroughly probed at the time of its occurrence leaves\r\n  great latitude for the villanous conjectures of parties whose\r\n  interest it may be to damage others in the estimation of the public.\r\n\r\n§ 206. Besides supplying the defect of administrative arrangements in\r\nrespect to the cases of suspicion which at present escape inquiry, the\r\nproposed appointment of officers of health presents as a further\r\nincidental advantage the means of abating an evil which has been the\r\nsubject of much complaint, namely, the grievous pain inflicted on the\r\nrelations and survivors, and the expense to the public by the holding of\r\ninquests, which the subsequent evidence and the terms of the verdicts\r\nhave shown to have been unnecessary. In the metropolis, and in many\r\nextensive districts inquests are chiefly moved on the representations of\r\ncommon parish beadles, or by common parish constables, to whom the\r\ninquest is usually a source of emolument. This will be admitted to be\r\none of the least secure and satisfactory agencies in towns that could\r\nwell be employed for so important a purpose. I have been informed of\r\ninstances where they have been paid to avoid the annoyance of inquests\r\nin cases where from sudden but natural deaths, as from apoplexy,\r\ninquests might have been held, and that there is reason to believe that\r\nsuch payments have not been unfrequent. Such agency cannot be said to be\r\na secure one either as to integrity or discretion.\r\n\r\n§ 207. I am informed by Mr. Payne, the coroner for the city of London,\r\nthat he has in some cases felt it to be his duty to send a confidential\r\nperson to make inquiries for him, before he would act on the ordinary\r\nsources of information in holding inquests. I have also been informed\r\nthat other coroners adopt the same laudable practice, and frequently\r\nincur the trouble and expense of previous inquiries by more trustworthy\r\npersons, in cases where the alleged cause of death is not manifest. The\r\nappointment of medical officers of health might be made without the\r\nexercise of any new or anomalous powers to relieve the coroners from\r\nsuch necessity, and at the same time give the public cause to be better\r\nsatisfied that no really suspicious cases were shrouded and concealed,\r\nand that none escaped from inadvertence.[42] I believe that on the uses\r\nto be derived from the appointment of the officers in question most\r\ncoroners would concur in the opinions expressed in the following answer\r\nreceived from Mr. Payne.\r\n\r\n  In reply to your inquiry (respecting the Medical Registrars of\r\n  Deaths giving notice to the Coroner of such deaths as may appear to\r\n  them to inquire to be investigated by him), I beg to say that I have\r\n  long felt there has been something wanting in the machinery by which\r\n  inquiries into deaths are, or ought to be regulated.\r\n\r\n  In cases of death from external violence, where the injury is\r\n  apparent, the constable of the district is fully aware of the\r\n  necessity of applying to the coroner; but in cases of sudden or\r\n  other deaths where there is no cause apparent to a common observer,\r\n  there is a necessity for some qualified person forming a judgment as\r\n  to the expediency of a judicial inquiry into the cause of death, and\r\n  I know of none so well qualified to form such a judgment as a member\r\n  of the medical profession. The office of _searcher_, when properly\r\n  carried out, was useful as far as it could be in the hands of old\r\n  women, but that could only apply to cases in which external violence\r\n  was apparent to the view on searching the body. I believe, however,\r\n  that the office has now ceased to exist, and the present mode of\r\n  registering deaths does not supply any means of detecting unnatural\r\n  or violent deaths. I am therefore quite of opinion that a Medical\r\n  Registrar (chosen for his ability and _discretion_) who would not\r\n  unnecessarily annoy the feelings of private families, and yet make\r\n  himself acquainted with the death by personal knowledge, would be a\r\n  valuable addition to the present mode of ascertaining and\r\n  registering deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n      _Advantages to Science from the Improvement of the Mortuary\r\n                             Registration._\r\n\r\n§ 208. Extending the view from the private and public immediate and\r\nextraordinary necessities which may be met by a staff of well qualified\r\npublic officers, exercising the duties and powers proposed, to the\r\nordinary but higher public wants, it will be found they may in that\r\nposition obtain in years, or even in months, indications of the certain\r\nmeans of prevention of disease, for which the medical experience of ages\r\nhas supplied no means of cure, and only doubtful means of alleviation.\r\n\r\n§ 209. There is not one medical man who has acted as a registrar of\r\ndeaths who has been consulted on this subject, who does not state as a\r\nresult of his short experience under the registration of the fact of\r\ndeaths, and even of the distant and imperfect statements of the causes\r\nof death, that it has given them such a knowledge as no private practice\r\ncould give of the effect of habits of life and of locality in producing\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n§ 210. As a practical instance of the immediate advantages of placing\r\nthe business of registration under the guidance of medical knowledge,\r\nmay be cited the following from the statement of Mr. Jones, a medical\r\nofficer, who acts as registrar of the Strand Union. Speaking of the\r\nworking of the registration, he says—\r\n\r\n  I find that neither my experience as a medical officer, for many\r\n  years in the parish, nor my experience as a private practitioner,\r\n  give me the same extended view of the causes of death as the\r\n  mortuary registration. It brings to my knowledge cases which I could\r\n  not know as a private practitioner: for example, as to the\r\n  occurrence of small-pox or epidemics. In such instances, it is of\r\n  use to me, as it sometimes enables me to go to places where I\r\n  believe children have not been vaccinated, and suggest to the family\r\n  the necessity of vaccination as a measure of prevention. When I have\r\n  received information of one or two cases of small-pox, I have looked\r\n  to the register of births, and sent to other people to warn them of\r\n  the necessity of vaccination.\r\n\r\n§ 211. On the advantages which inquiries for the registration of death\r\nwould give, the concurrent opinions of several eminent medical men may\r\nbe expressed in the terms used by Dr. Calvert Holland, of Sheffield, who\r\nobserves that, “From an inquiry on the spot concerning the train of\r\nsymptoms preceding death, the general examination of the body, or from\r\nconversation with the medical attendant, the cause of death, with few\r\nexceptions, would probably be assigned with as much accuracy as by any\r\nplan that can possibly be devised. We should hail such an appointment as\r\none of great value. Even in those instances in which it is difficult,\r\nfrom the obscurity or undefined character of the symptoms, to say\r\nprecisely what is the cause of death, the inquiry would tend to\r\ndissipate the doubts or obscurity in which it might be involved. The\r\nduties of the officer, if he possessed first-rate professional\r\nabilities, would give to him a power of analyzing symptoms, of tracing\r\ncause and effect, which few practitioners possess or can acquire in a\r\nlong life of professional exertions. Were the causes of death analyzed\r\nand recorded by one having no other duties, and fitted by his\r\naccomplishments to undertake the task, the medical and statistical\r\ninquirer would possess a body of information on the influence of general\r\nlocal circumstances as well as on particular agents in connexion with\r\nmanufactures, the just value of which it is not possible to appreciate.”\r\n\r\n§ 212. For the promotion of the new science of prevention, and the\r\nknowledge of causes necessary to it, a primary requisite is to bring\r\nlarge classes of cases as may be duly observed, under the eye of one\r\nobserver. It would be a practicable arrangement, on the receipt of the\r\nnotices of deaths, to direct the visits of one officer chiefly to cases\r\nof the same class, for the purpose of collecting information as to the\r\ncommon causes or antecedents. The amount of remuneration included in the\r\nestimate hereafter given might be made the means of obtaining additional\r\ntime and services for carrying the inspections of the officers of health\r\nstill further into the circumstances of the living; as in cases of\r\nconsumption or fever, where numbers came from the same place of work or\r\noccupation, to visit and ascertain whether there was any overcrowding or\r\nany latent cause of disease.\r\n\r\n§ 213. In an important paper which Dr. Calvert Holland has written “On\r\nthe Diseases of the Lungs from mechanical causes,” he gives an account\r\nof the physical and moral condition of the cutlers’ dry grinders of\r\nSheffield, whose case may be cited not only as further exemplifying the\r\nlarge evils, § 200, which, in the absence of protective public\r\narrangements, will pass without complaint from the _immediate_\r\nsufferers, but as showing the advantages derivable from any arrangements\r\nwhich bring large classes of cases within one intelligent view, _i. e._\r\nbefore an officer of health, in presenting clearly common causes of\r\nevil, and in suggesting means of prevention, which in single cases or\r\nsmaller groups of cases might not have challenged attention or justified\r\nany confident conclusions as to the remedies available.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the steel and stone dust arising in the processes of\r\ngrinding cutlery, is peculiarly injurious to the class of workpeople\r\nengaged in it, and that those who continue at the work are generally cut\r\noff before they are thirty-five or forty-five years of age. Formerly the\r\nsame workmen completed several processes in the making of knives, of\r\nwhich processes grinding was only one. At that time the “grinders’\r\ndisease” was very little known, and the men lived to about the average\r\nage, and were considered the most respectable class of the Sheffield\r\nworkmen. As the manufacture advanced the labour became subdivided, and\r\none class of workmen were wholly occupied with the destructive process\r\nof grinding. Whether their numbers were kept down by the excessive\r\nmortality, or a monopoly were maintained by the destructive effects of\r\nthe process, wages were so high as to allow them to play during a part\r\nof the week. Then arose that avidity for immediate and reckless\r\nenjoyment, common to all uneducated minds under the perception of a\r\ntransient existence. When trade was good they would only work a part of\r\nthe week; they spent the remainder in the riot and the dissipation\r\ncharacteristic of soldiers after a siege. Many of them each kept a\r\nhound, and had it trained by a master of the hunt, and their several\r\nhounds formed a pack with which they hunted lawlessly, and poached over\r\nany grounds within their reach. The grinders pack is still kept up\r\namongst them. They became reckless in their marriages. “The more\r\ndestructive the branch of work,” says Dr. Holland, “the more ignorant,\r\nreckless, and dissipated are the workmen, and the effects may be traced\r\nin the tendency to marry, and generally at exceedingly early ages.” He\r\nfurther observes of one class of them, that amongst them “nature appears\r\nnot only precocious but extremely fruitful.” Their short and improvident\r\ncareer is attended by a proportionately large amount of premature and\r\nwretched widowhood and destitute orphanage.\r\n\r\nThis one class of cases was brought fortuitously under the observation\r\nof Dr. Holland, and he has done what a competent officer of health could\r\nscarcely have omitted to attempt to do,—to devise means of prevention\r\nand reclaim their execution.\r\n\r\nOne benevolent inventor proposed the adoption of a magnetic guard, or\r\nmouth-piece, the efficiency of which consisted in the attraction of the\r\nmetallic particles evolved in the process of grinding. But the dust to\r\nwhich the grinder was exposed consisted of the gritty particles of the\r\nstone as well as of the metallic particles of the instruments ground,\r\nand if the invention had been adopted, it would still have left the men\r\nexposed to the gritty particles. It was not, however, adopted, nor does\r\nit appear that any efficient preventive would be voluntarily adopted by\r\nthese reckless men. Dr. Holland invented another mode, which acts\r\nindependently of the men, and which is very simple, and, it is\r\nconfidently stated, that after a trial of some years, it has proved\r\nequal to the complete correction of the evil. It consists of an\r\narrangement by which a current of air, directed over the work, carries\r\nfrom the workman clear out of the apartment all the gritty as well as\r\nall the metallic particles. The expense of the apparatus would scarcely\r\nexceed the proportion of a sovereign to each grinder. But it is not\r\nadopted; and Dr. Holland is in the position of an officer of health, on\r\nbehalf of mothers and children, to reclaim authoritative intervention\r\nand the interests of society to arrest the suicidal and demoralizing\r\nwaste of life. Having consulted his experience on the advantages of such\r\nan office as that in question to the working classes, he speaks in\r\nstrong and confident terms of the benefits to be derived from it:—\r\n\r\n  Perhaps in no manufacturing community is human life, in large\r\n  classes of men, so shortened or accompanied with such an amount of\r\n  suffering or wretchedness as in this town, in connection with\r\n  certain staple manufactures. Were the legislature to interfere and\r\n  enforce the correction of the evils, by a system of ventilation,\r\n  which is neither difficult nor expensive to put in operation, the\r\n  duties of this officer, if directed to the superintendence of this\r\n  system, would save numerous lives and prevent an incalculable amount\r\n  of misery. At present, in consequence of these evils, a majority of\r\n  the artisans is killed off from twenty-five to thirty-five years of\r\n  age, and numbers annually leaving widows and children in great\r\n  destitution, and, in most cases, dependent on the parish. The evils\r\n  are not inseparably connected with the occupation; they admit of\r\n  redress. An officer of health, by maintaining the system of\r\n  ventilation in efficient operation, would save numerous lives, would\r\n  create a better tone of mind among the artisans—for wretchedness is\r\n  closely allied with ignorance and immorality—would diminish the high\r\n  rate of mortality amongst the young under five years of age—left by\r\n  the premature death of the parent unprovided for, and lastly, would\r\n  greatly relieve the parish funds. The officer, having the power to\r\n  remove at once any case of fever from a densely populated locality,\r\n  as well as to enforce measures of prevention, such as the removal of\r\n  accumulated filth, stagnant pools of water, or the correction of any\r\n  other local circumstances, would perform duties which would redound\r\n  considerably to the advantage of the community.\r\n\r\n§ 214. In confirmation of the views of the benefits derivable to medical\r\nscience from such arrangements as those proposed, § 211, various\r\ninstances might be adduced besides the last cited, § 213, and that\r\nalready given in the General Report, p. 355, of the discoveries made, on\r\nan examination of 1000 cases, by M. Louis, on the nature of consumption,\r\nnow generally recognized as presenting facts at variance with all\r\nancient and previous modern opinions: but in respect of the views there\r\nstated, as to the great public importance of well-ascertained medical\r\nstatistics, I submit the high confirmation derivable from the following\r\nstatement contained in the recently published outlines of pathology and\r\npractice of medicine, by Dr. W. Pulteney Alison, fellow and late\r\npresident of the College of Physicians at Edinburgh, and professor of\r\nthe practice of medicine in the University of Edinburgh:—\r\n\r\n“The living body,” he observes, “assumes, in many cases, different kinds\r\nof diseased action, varying remarkably in different periods of life,\r\nwithout any apparent or known cause; but in the greater number of cases\r\nit is generally believed that certain circumstances in the situation or\r\ncondition of patients, before diseases appear, can be assigned with\r\nconfidence as their causes. The efficacy of these, however, is seldom\r\nestablished in any other way than simply by the observation that persons\r\nknown to be exposed to their influence become afflicted with certain\r\ndiseases in a proportion very much greater than those who are not known\r\nto be so exposed.\r\n\r\n“This kind of evidence is in many _individual_ cases very liable to\r\nfallacy, in consequence of the great variety of the circumstances\r\ncapable of affecting health, in which individuals are placed, and of the\r\ndifficulty of varying these so as to obtain such observations, in the\r\nway of induction or exclusion, as shall be decisive as to the efficacy\r\nof each. Hence the importance of the observations intended to illustrate\r\nthis matter being as extensively multiplied as possible; and hence also\r\nthe peculiar value, with a view to the investigation of the causes of\r\ndiseases, of observations made on large and organized bodies of men, as\r\nin the experience of military and naval practitioners. All the\r\ncircumstances of the whole number of men whose diseases are there\r\nobserved, are in many respects exactly alike; they are accurately known\r\nto the observer, and are indeed often to a certain degree at his\r\ndisposal; they are often suddenly changed, and when changed as to one\r\nportion of the individuals under observation, they are often unchanged\r\nas to another; and therefore the conditions necessary to obtaining an\r\n_experimentum crucis_ as to the efficacy of an alleged cause of disease\r\nare more frequently in the power of such an observer than of one who is\r\nconversant only with civil life.\r\n\r\n“But when the necessary precautions as to the multiplication of facts,\r\nand the exclusion of circumstances foreign to the result in question,\r\nare observed, the efficacy of the remote causes of disease may often be\r\ndetermined _statistically_, and with absolute certainty; and the\r\nknowledge thus acquired as leading directly to the _prevention_ of\r\ndisease, is often of the greatest importance, especially with a view to\r\nregulations of medical police. And if the human race be destined, in\r\nfuture ages, to possess greater wisdom and happiness in this state of\r\nexistence than at present, the value of this knowledge may be expected\r\nto increase in the progress of time; because there are many diseases\r\nwhich the experience of ages has brought only partially within the power\r\nof medicine, but the causes of which are known, and under certain\r\ncircumstances may be avoided; and the conditions necessary for avoiding\r\nthem are in a great measure in the power of _communities_, though at\r\npresent beyond the power of many of the individuals composing these.\r\n\r\n“There are, indeed, various cases, of frequent occurrence, in which the\r\nstudy of the remote causes of disease is as practically important as\r\nanything that can be learnt as to their history, or the effects of\r\nremedies upon them. This is particularly true of epidemic diseases, and\r\nof diseases to which a tendency is given by irremediable constitutional\r\ninfirmities.”\r\n\r\nHaving had the honour to be associated with the late Dr. Cowan of\r\nGlasgow, Dr. Alison, and some other gentlemen, in a committee to\r\nconsider of the means of obtaining a system of mortuary registration for\r\nScotland, and having conversed with many qualified persons who have also\r\npaid much attention to the subject, I may state confidently that the\r\nexposition above given of the advantages derivable to the public service\r\nfrom the improvement of vital statistics would meet with extensive\r\nconcurrence, independently of the very high sanction conferred by any\r\nexpression of an opinion on such a subject from Dr. Alison. The towns\r\nwhere the greatest mortality prevails present precisely the\r\nopportunities so highly appreciated, of observations on large and\r\norganized bodies of men, § 213, often as similar in the chief\r\ncircumstances which govern their condition, as the classes presented to\r\nthe observation of medical officers in the army or in the navy.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon observes, in his suggestions for an inquiry into the causes\r\nof death—“And this inquiry, we hope, might redound to a general good, if\r\nphysicians would but exert themselves and raise their minds above the\r\nsordid considerations of cure; not deriving their honour from the\r\nnecessities of mankind, but becoming ministers to the Divine power and\r\ngoodness both in prolonging and restoring the life of man; especially as\r\nthis may be effected by safe, commodious, and not illiberal means,\r\nthough hitherto unattempted. And certainly it would be an earnest of\r\nDivine favour if, whilst we are journeying to the land of promise, our\r\ngarments, those frail bodies of ours, were not greatly to wear out in\r\nthe wilderness of this world.” It would accord with his great views that\r\nadequate public provision and arrangement should be made to enable\r\nphysicians to render the services desired. From the earliest time to the\r\npresent, when the subject of sanitary evil and desecration of\r\ngrave-yards was brought before the public by the long-continued\r\nexertions of Mr. Walker, members of the medical profession have made the\r\nmost strenuous exertions and sacrifices for the attainment of such\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nIt is submitted that, in whatsoever place a proper system of the\r\nverification and registration of the fact and cause of death has not\r\nbeen introduced, as in Ireland and Scotland, and in all populous and\r\nincreasing districts, that the appointment of an officer of health,\r\nhaving charge and regulations of all interments, would be the most\r\neconomical as well as the most efficient mode of introducing it: in\r\nevery place it must be a measure of paramount importance.\r\n\r\n§ 215. As an instance of the incompatibility of such duties as those of\r\nthe proposed officer of public health, with service in connexion with\r\nany existing local administrative body, it may be mentioned that every\r\nlocal Board in such a town as Sheffield would comprehend some of the\r\nchief householders, who would most probably be the chief manufacturers\r\nand employers of the class of workmen, and that even the official\r\nconnexion would to such minds as the workmen expose him to suspicion,\r\nand diminish his influence, for the effectuation of any voluntary\r\nchanges of practice. On other grounds, such as the absence of\r\nqualification in such Boards to give superior directions; and such\r\ngrounds as those specified in p. 322 and p. 349 and 350 of the General\r\nReport, it is submitted that the functions of the officer of health\r\nwould be the best exercised, independently of any other local\r\nadministrative body. He would, in an independent capacity, be the most\r\npowerful auxiliary of any well-intended and zealous administration of\r\nlocal works, and as his functions must bring him at once to the chief\r\nspots where the consequences of neglects and omissions would be often\r\nmanifest in fatal events, he would, as an independent and yet\r\nresponsible officer, exercise an extensive influence and an efficient\r\ncheck on behalf of the public at large.\r\n\r\n§ 216. Every efficient measure of improvement of the sanitary condition\r\nof the population, must be in its mere pecuniary results a measure of a\r\nlarge economy (§ 80). Physicians and medical officers are of opinion\r\nthat all the ordinary and extraordinary duties specified, and even more,\r\nmay be done by an officer of health with the same average expenditure of\r\ntime (taking one case with another), that occurs to a physician in\r\nvisiting a patient, examining the case, writing out a prescription and\r\ngiving instructions to attendants. I shall be able to show that it may\r\nbe accomplished at a charge no greater than that now paid by the\r\nlabouring classes to one of their body as a steward or officer of their\r\nburial clubs who is required to inspect and identify the body of a\r\ndeceased member.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Proximate Estimate of the comparative Expense of Interments under\r\n                 arrangements for National Cemeteries._\r\n\r\nHaving shown the chief desiderata in respect to the improvement of the\r\npractice of interment, and the means of protecting the public health, I\r\nproceed to submit the substance of the information collected as to the\r\nmeans of obtaining them.\r\n\r\n§ 217. In submitting for consideration a proximate estimate of the\r\nextent to which it is practicable to carry that reduction of the expense\r\nof interments, which is so important to the middle and lower classes,\r\nthe expense of interments of gentry and persons of the middle class of\r\nlife is taken at double the amount at which persons of great experience\r\nin providing for the interment of large numbers have estimated they may\r\nbe executed for without any reduction of the essentials to a decent\r\nsolemnity.\r\n\r\n§ 218. The estimate takes the existing scale of burial fees of the\r\nparish of St. James, Westminster, as fees to be continued, which would,\r\nif received in a fee fund, not only provide compensation for vested\r\ninterests, but go far to provide the expense of new services.\r\n\r\n§ 219. To the estimate of the expenses of interment is superadded a fee\r\nto defray the expenses of medical officers of a board of public health.\r\nThe reduction of that great source of waste and expense, the payment of\r\ntwo or three stages of profits, for materials, &c. of funerals (by\r\nplacing them under general arrangements), would admit of this charge,\r\nwhich is really a means to a still greater economy, the economy of\r\nhealth and life, and consequently of the number of funerals themselves.\r\nObjection to these charges would scarcely have place where the pecuniary\r\neconomy is immediate. The medical service proposed may be procured to\r\nthe working classes (supposing it were necessary to charge the expense\r\non the funeral) at all distances, for the same sum as that which they\r\nnow pay to the unlearned inspectors, officers of their clubs, for\r\ninspection within short distances, namely, 2_s._ 6_d._ It is declared by\r\ncompetent witnesses, that a respectable officer of public health, a\r\nphysician, performing such services as those described, would be\r\nwelcomed in most families on such a charge as 10_s._ 6_d._ for the\r\nmiddle classes, and 1_l._ 1_s._ for the higher classes, charged as a\r\npart of the reduced funeral expenses.\r\n\r\n  _Estimated Scale of Charges for Interments in the Metropolis,\r\n    inclusive of Compensations;

In this estimate the expense of the funerals of the classes\r\n“undescribed” in the mortuary registries may be taken as representing\r\nthe second or third class of tradesmen. In the estimate of the expense\r\nof funerals of persons of the first class, no account is taken for a\r\nlong cavalcade of mourning coaches; but those who are conversant with\r\nthe details agree that several may be supplied, with a full retinue of\r\nhired mourners, and the expense be yet kept below one-half the present\r\namount of charges. A confident opinion is expressed that interments\r\nmight be performed, under general arrangements, with all the advantages\r\nspecified, and full compensation be given, at a rate of between 5_l._\r\nand 6_l._ each funeral, instead of about 15_l._, the present average.\r\n\r\n§ 221. On the eight chief cemeteries opened in the metropolis by private\r\ncompanies, and comprising about 260 acres, or considerably more than the\r\nspace occupied by all the parochial and private burial grounds whatever,\r\na capital of about 400,000_l._ has been invested. The expenses of\r\nlitigation and of procuring Acts of Parliament, and purchasing grounds,\r\nmust have been excessively heavy; and it appears probable that, for an\r\namount not much greater or not exceeding it by more than one-fifth,\r\nsuperior national cemeteries, with houses of reception and appropriate\r\nchapels, may be formed on the present scale of expenditure of these\r\ncompanies, and in a style commensurate with what is due to the\r\nmetropolis of the empire. If the charge of the purchase of the land and\r\nthe structural arrangements be spread over 30 years, and the payment of\r\nthe money charged, with interest, on the burials of persons of the\r\nhigher and middle classes, the amount might be included in the total\r\ncharges for funerals above estimated for the several classes, which\r\ncharges, though so much below the amount at present usually paid, are\r\nyet higher than asserted to be necessary by respectable tradesmen, ready\r\nto verify their assertions by sureties to supply the materials and\r\nservice of an equal or of a better description for the public than that\r\nwhich they now obtain. If the charges of the new cemeteries and\r\nestablishments at such rates as those suggested were taken as\r\nsubstitutes for the existing rates of charge for graves, the new rates\r\nwould be for the middle and higher classes greatly below the charges\r\nusually found in undertakers’ bills and executors’ accounts. If those\r\nnew expenses were levied in the shape of a poll tax, or as burial dues,\r\na sum of about 5_d._ per head per annum (exclusive of the expense of\r\ncollection) would suffice in the metropolis to repay the principal and\r\ninterest of purchase-money in 30 years, and also to defray the annual\r\nestablishment charges.\r\n\r\n§ 222. The establishment charges of the existing eight principal\r\ncemeteries amount, it is stated, to about 7500_l._ per annum. I believe,\r\nthat by appropriate arrangements of a public establishment a far more\r\nefficient service might be obtained for national cemeteries for the same\r\nmoney. Assuming that the greatest solemnity and the highest cathedral\r\nservice is due to funerals, four full choirs of 20 choristers and four\r\norganists to lead them might be obtained for less than 10,000_l._ per\r\nannum for four national cemeteries to meet the wishes of those who\r\ndesire a service of the highest solemnity. The lowest aggregate charge\r\nfor the separate establishments of parochial and suburban burial\r\ngrounds, if only on the scale of that of St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields,\r\nmust be at the least 25,000_l._, and would probably extend to 30,000_l._\r\nor 40,000_l._ per annum. Such an amount in connexion with national\r\ncemeteries would suffice to maintain, in addition to the superior\r\nreligious establishments above described, a superior description of\r\nintermediate houses of reception for the dead, with houses and offices\r\nfor the residence of the officers of public health in care of them: it\r\nwould beyond that suffice to provide the means for accommodation, on a\r\nlarge scale, for the reception and treatment of all persons labouring\r\nunder infectious diseases. It might also suffice for the establishment\r\nof public baths, in which the metropolis is also deficient.\r\n\r\n§ 223. The number of the officers of health requisite for the due\r\nexecution of the service could only be determined by experience; but,\r\njudging from analogous experience, a much smaller staff than on the\r\nfirst view might be expected would suffice for the performance of all\r\nthe duties specified, if their whole time were devoted to them. Medical\r\nofficers of dispensaries, within their districts, visit, examine, and\r\ntreat twenty or thirty cases per diem; physicians in full practice, and\r\ndriving to distant parts of the town, on the average (which includes\r\ncases of short visits of a few minutes and cases where a long attendance\r\nwould be required), visit about three cases in the hour. This appears to\r\nbe the best analogous experience. On this experience, and considering\r\nthat it would be good economy to provide each officer with a one-horse\r\nvehicle, he may be expected to visit fifteen cases a-day, one day with\r\nthe other, out of the daily number of deaths. The two public medical\r\ndepartments, the navy and the army, have rendered the highest, if not\r\nthe only, public service in the prevention of disease—the navy medical\r\ndepartment especially; which service it has been enabled to achieve from\r\nhaving the subjects of its care under the most complete control. The\r\nscale of remuneration to these officers, who, whatever diploma they may\r\npossess, are required to undergo, and do undergo, a special\r\nre-examination, is taken for estimating the expense. There are various\r\ngrounds that, at all events at the outset, and for their superior\r\nresponsibility, this class of officers should be selected. The proposed\r\nstaff would be as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                                           Per Annum.\r\n                                                          £.   _s._ _d._\r\n An inspector of public health, of the rank of an\r\n   inspector-general of hospitals in the army, or of       657    0    0\r\n   fleets in the navy, at full pay of 1_l._ 16_s._ per\r\n   diem, at the rate given after ten years’ service\r\n\r\n A deputy inspector-general, at the rate of the army       438    0    0\r\n   full pay of 1_l._ 4_s._ per diem\r\n\r\n Eight inspectors of public health, of the rank of staff\r\n   surgeon, at the rate of the army full pay of 19_s._   2,774    0    0\r\n   per diem\r\n\r\n Two supernumeraries, of the pay of regimental surgeons,   547   10    0\r\n   at the rate of the army pay of 15_s._ per diem\r\n\r\n Ten single horse vehicles, and ten drivers, at 1_l._    1,638    0    0\r\n   1_s._ per week, total 3_l._ 3_s._ per week each\r\n                                                         —————   ——    —\r\n                          Total                          6,054   10    0\r\n                                                         —————   ——    —\r\n\r\nTen officers, visiting fifteen cases per diem, would suffice to take\r\norder such as described, for the burial of 45,000 persons. They will\r\nalso be enabled in upwards of 8,000 cases to direct measures for the\r\nprotection of the survivors and their neighbours from the spread of\r\ncontagious disease.

The Metropolis\r\n  is calculated on the average of the years 1840 and 1841, the other\r\n  places on the year 1840.\r\n\r\n§ 224. The total number of funerals and deaths requiring verification\r\ndaily would be—for Birmingham about 12, for Nottingham 5, for Leicester\r\n3, for Derby 3. From the data above given it will be seen at how small\r\nan expenditure of time a well directed force for the prevention as well\r\nas the alleviation of misery—vast interests of the population, that are\r\nnow neglected—may be placed, under responsible superintendence, and on\r\nthe most sordid views of economy of money, immense savings, under proper\r\nregulations, be made. In Liverpool alone, in the business of cure or\r\nalleviation there are now engaged 50 physicians, and 250 surgeons,\r\napothecaries, and druggists, and not one responsible public officer to\r\ninvestigate the causes of disease with a view to prevention. Nor has the\r\ncity of London, with a population of 125,000, one such officer, though\r\nit has an expenditure of 72,000_l._ per annum in hospitals and endowed\r\nmedical charities alone, for the alleviation of disease.\r\n\r\n§ 225. There is much experience to establish the conclusion that very\r\nspecial qualifications are requisite for the performance of the duties\r\nof an officer of the public health. The only safe proof of the\r\npossession of such qualifications is the fact of a person having\r\ninvestigated successfully some scientific question on the prevention of\r\ndisease to a practical end, by which the main qualification, the habit\r\nof practical investigation, and zeal and ability for the service of\r\nprevention may be placed beyond doubt. It would be no imputation on the\r\nmerits of a general medical practitioner that he was found unsuited to\r\nthe performance of the duties devolving on an officer of public health.\r\nThe working of the Parisian administrative arrangements shows the injury\r\ndone to the public service by the difficulty of retrieving any mistaken\r\nappointment, and suggests the desirableness of an arrangement to\r\nfacilitate changes of the officers of health even where there is the\r\nsecurity of a previous special examination as to the qualifications for\r\nthe office. Cases would occur where officers would themselves choose to\r\nwithdraw from such a service, for which they felt unsuited, if they\r\nmight retire without imputation and without any severe sacrifice. If,\r\ntherefore, officers of health were chosen from amongst those who had\r\nlong served with honour in the army or navy medical department, the\r\nadvantage would be gained of a facility of retirement being given to the\r\nofficer of health (an office, indeed, which would often be trying to the\r\nconstitution), and without loss of rank or of the means of livelihood.\r\n\r\n§ 226. The arrangements for the performance of the funereal rites in\r\npublic cemeteries would, of course, fall to the proper ecclesiastical\r\nauthority. The architectural arrangements, and the decoration of the\r\ncemeteries, may claim the highest aid that art can give to the\r\nproduction of solemn religious impressions. Public monuments and works\r\nof art have of late been extensively thrown open to the population, and\r\nthere is evidence that this course of proceeding has been productive of\r\nbeneficial effects on those of the lower classes who have had\r\nopportunities of viewing such monuments during their holidays. But the\r\nplace of burial is the object to which the views of almost every\r\nindividual of that class, as well as of others, is ever most intently\r\ndirected. All the structural and decorative arrangements of the national\r\ncemetery should, therefore, be made by the highest talent that can be\r\nprocured, with the purpose of interesting the feelings, under the\r\nconviction that in rendering attractive that place we are preparing\r\n_the_ picture which is most frequently present to the minds of the\r\npoorest, in the hours of mental and bodily infirmity, and the last\r\npicture on earth presented to his contemplation before dissolution.\r\n\r\n§ 227. It will have been seen that if the tendency of the public mind be\r\nfollowed out by the economical regulation of funeral expenses, and if\r\nthe public be protected from the extortions of undertakers, considerable\r\nreductions of expense may be effected, and munificent provision may yet\r\nbe made for permanent decorations.\r\n\r\nThese reductions would, also, under practicable regulations of the mode\r\nand practice of interment, admit of full and liberal compensation to all\r\nlegal and proper interests affected by the proposed change of the\r\npractice, and to whom Parliament might determine that compensation\r\nshould be awarded.\r\n\r\n§ 228. In the case of the ministers of the Established Church in large\r\ntowns, the surplice fees, including the burial dues, are to be\r\nconsidered as the main parts of their incomes. They have no tithes, and\r\nno other means of livelihood. But the burial dues are so variously\r\nregulated—in some places by custom, in other places by local Acts—that\r\nit is scarcely practicable to lay down any one scale in respect to them\r\nthat would not operate unequally and unjustly. Complaints from cemetery\r\ncompanies are made in respect to the existing scales of compensation,\r\nwhich did not appear to be within my province to investigate. It\r\nappeared to me that the only satisfactory mode of determining the amount\r\nof compensation would be an adjudication and examination of the case of\r\neach parish. This would be a service, which the Commissioners for the\r\nCommutation of Tithes would be competent to render.\r\n\r\n§ 229. The claims of families who have purchased the privilege of\r\ninterment in private vaults are not, that I find, maintained to any\r\nextent by the possessors, but are rather suggested as obstacles by\r\nothers. That which at the time of purchase was deemed a privilege is now\r\nproved to be an injury to the community at large, not to speak of the\r\nvery families by whom the right of interment in the church which they\r\nattend is exercised. When the fact is known of the deleterious character\r\nof the miasma which arises wherever bodies waste away, it were\r\ninconsistent with all religious feeling to maintain, as a privilege, the\r\nright of endangering the health of their families, friends, or\r\nneighbours. The same observation is applicable to grave-yards attached\r\nto chapels belonging to Dissenting congregations. Burial there is an\r\ninjury to the congregations themselves, and the removal of interments a\r\nbenefit to them; and although any one may choose to put up with the\r\ninjury, or refuse to admit the evidence of it, they can scarcely claim\r\nto continue the injury at the expense of others, or against the\r\nconviction of the majority of the community and the opinions and customs\r\nof all civilized nations by whom the practice of interments in towns is\r\nprohibited. The overwhelming evidence that what is deemed a privilege is\r\nreally an injury, precludes all claim to compensation as for a loss. No\r\nclaim is set forth by any congregation for compensation as for the loss\r\nof a gainful trade of burial. Setting aside, then, the question of\r\nright, it may be submitted in respect to the owners of private vaults in\r\nparochial burial grounds, whether claimants, within a given time, may\r\nnot be allowed an equal space in the national cemeteries, and be allowed\r\nto transfer the remains of their ancestors thither, and erect suitable\r\nmonuments to them. It may also be submitted that the sites occupied as\r\nburial grounds may be re-purchased from the congregations on liberal\r\nterms of compensation, to be kept as open spaces for the public use, and\r\nthat those congregations may have equivalent spaces allotted to them at\r\na distance from town in the new cemeteries. The authorities carrying out\r\nthe change, should be enabled, on the like terms, to re-purchase from\r\nprivate companies such cemeteries as may be deemed eligible for the\r\npublic, and engage their officers in the public service, or otherwise\r\ncompensate them. The success of national cemeteries, would doubtlessly\r\noccasion loss to those who have subscribed capital in what was at the\r\ntime a public improvement, and it is further submitted for\r\nconsideration, whether the power of re-purchase for the public, from the\r\nproceeds of a reduced burial expenditure, might not be extended to the\r\nre-purchase of such sites even where they would not be found eligible\r\nfor national cemeteries.\r\n\r\n§ 230. If it be decided that the protection so much needed by all\r\nclasses, especially by the poorest, in respect to the expense of\r\ninterments shall be given, by empowering officers of health to carry out\r\nregulations the same in principle as those which have given relief and\r\nsatisfaction in well regulated communities, it may then be submitted for\r\nconsideration, whether the cases of the tradesmen who have devoted\r\nthemselves entirely to the business of supplying funereal materials and\r\nservice, and who will be wholly superseded, could not be brought within\r\nany legitimate principles and precedents of compensation, for the loss\r\nof their existing multiform monopoly by the whole or any portion of the\r\nsupply having been transferred to officers responsible to the public. By\r\nmeans of such transference, the public gain will, in proportion to its\r\ncompleteness, be immense. Without it there is no apparent means of\r\nchange or compensation that will not increase the existing expenses, and\r\nalso increase the train of existing evils consequent on those expenses.\r\nWhatever may be the sacrifice or inconvenience experienced by this class\r\nof tradesmen from such a transference, it were a lamentable misdirection\r\nof sympathy to sustain their pecuniary interests at the expense of the\r\nperpetuation of the enormous pecuniary sacrifices of the poorest and\r\nmost helpless classes. But it may be submitted that the large work of\r\ncharity and justice to the public from the change proposed, need not be\r\naccomplished by the sacrifice of the real principals in the business of\r\nundertaking. If the alterations proposed were not made, it is\r\nnevertheless probable that this business will be considerably changed.\r\nThe practicability and advantage of the consolidation of the business of\r\nthe supply of funereal materials and services under one general\r\nmanagement with the cemetery, and the acceptability of the institution\r\nof a place for the reception and care of the dead previous to interment,\r\nare attested by the fact of which I am informed, that in consequence of\r\nthe proposed measures having been necessarily developed by the course of\r\nthe present inquiry from a multitude of witnesses, joint stock companies\r\nare now preparing to adopt, as a source of emolument, similar\r\narrangements. To those persons who are not really principals in the\r\nbusiness, as they professed, but agents, whose only service consisted in\r\nconveying orders to real principals, and who extorted large profits from\r\nthose who employed them; to those carrying on the business of undertaker\r\nonly as an addition to their chief trade, and to whom the orders for a\r\nfuneral was “an occasional job”—to a large proportion of these classes,\r\nthe change would cause no ultimate loss, and to many it must be an\r\neventual gain. The business as at present conducted is in principle\r\nsimilar to a lottery in the excessive emoluments of death, amounting to\r\nupwards of half a million of money in the metropolis alone, and which is\r\nchiefly wrested from the poorer and depressed classes. Such an amount is\r\nannually distributed in prizes, which fall with the deaths, in sums\r\nvarying from a few pounds to several hundreds, amongst a crowd of\r\nexpectants, which even, under the existing management, is five times\r\nmore numerous than is necessary (and under the proposed arrangements ten\r\ntimes the number requisite), leaving the greater number poorly paid for\r\nall their waiting, notwithstanding the large sums exacted from the\r\nsuffering survivors. It may confidently be pronounced, that to the\r\nmajority of the class of inferior labourers, the change of system must\r\nbe an eventual and very early benefit.\r\n\r\n§ 231. As various religious communities would participate in the\r\nprovision of public cemeteries, it appears preferable, for the avoidance\r\nof jealousy and any pretext for dissatisfaction, and that such different\r\nparties may be freely communicated with, that land should be purchased,\r\nand the structural arrangements made, on due consultation by the\r\nCommissioners of Woods and Forests.\r\n\r\n§ 232. The sites for national cemeteries would be determinable on\r\nconsideration of circumstances affecting public health, and by\r\nconvenience of access, which the responsible officers of public health\r\nshould be required to investigate on a view or survey of the\r\ncircumstances of the metropolis in these respects as a whole. They would\r\nalso set forth the arrangements necessary for the preparation of the\r\nground for interment, for drainage, and the protection of the springs;\r\nand the prevention of the escape of miasma; from which regulations no\r\nclass of interments and no places should be exempted.\r\n\r\n§ 233. If the whole of the arrangements for sepulture were begun _de\r\nnovo_, the most eligible principle for defraying all the public charges,\r\nand perhaps most of those charges which are now private charges, would\r\nbe, as respects persons of the lower and middle ranks, by annual\r\npayments approximating to an insurance. With the wealthy classes payment\r\nat the time of interment partakes of the nature of a legacy duty, and is\r\nthen made most conveniently. With the lower and a large part of the\r\nmiddle classes of society, the death of an adult member of the family is\r\nfrequently the loss of the most productive member of the family, which\r\noccurs at a time when the family has, in almost every case, incurred\r\nsevere expenses for medical treatment during illness. The charges for\r\ninterment and for the mourning which custom requires, then press most\r\ngrievously. A large proportion of the middle and lower classes endeavour\r\nto alleviate this pressure by spreading it over long periods by means of\r\ninsurance, and amongst others by such expensive and uncertain modes as\r\nthose displayed in the regulations of burial clubs. The commutation of\r\nthe charge of insurance into an annual charge would be a public\r\ninsurance, possessing the advantages of superior security, and the means\r\nof superior efficiency as well as of economy. The chief obstacle that\r\nstands in the way of such an arrangement is the want of a machinery for\r\nthe annual collection of such a tax. It has been proposed to throw upon\r\nthe poor’s rates some of the additional charges supposed to be\r\nnecessary, and, in the event of the change being made by means of\r\nnumerous extra-mural parochial establishments, that certainly would be\r\nnecessary. But the imposition of such a charge in such a mode as to\r\nfollow the incidents of the poor’s-rates would be unequal and unjust.\r\nLarge districts of cottage tenements, which are now, chiefly to the\r\nbenefit of the landlords of those tenements and at the expense of the\r\nother rate-payers, exempted from poor’s-rates, would escape\r\ncontribution, and it is precisely in such districts that the deaths are\r\nmost frequent and the burial charges would be the most burthensome.\r\nLodgers would extensively escape the charges; strangers and foreigners,\r\nand the fluctuating population in large districts, would escape them. If\r\nthere were a machinery for collection, it is submitted that the most\r\nequitable mode of levying such charges would be, like those of a burial\r\nclub, _i. e._ of the nature of a poll-tax, or burial dues payable, per\r\nhead, on the number of persons inhabiting each house. These might be\r\nfixed for the whole community at a minimum rate, leaving it to the\r\nfriends of the deceased to pay for any higher class of funeral which\r\nthey think proper.\r\n\r\n§ 234. It is, however, to be borne in mind that in burial clubs, and in\r\nsavings’ banks, large sums are now actually set apart by the labouring\r\nclasses for the payment of funeral charges. Provision is, no doubt, also\r\nmade by will, by other classes for defraying such charges. In the plan\r\nproposed, even including the expense of the new agency of officers of\r\nhealth the consideration of new sources of additional payments is\r\nrendered unnecessary. On the whole, therefore (although if bodies are\r\nimmediately removed from the premises in cases where the removal is\r\nrequisite for the protection of the lives of the survivors, attempts\r\nwill be made to shift the expense to the public), it may be recommended\r\nthat all new charges and compensations should, for the present, at\r\nleast, still be defrayed from burial dues levied upon each interment.\r\nAnd in so far as any new expenses are for objects obviously beneficial\r\n(not to speak of those immediate charges being for the most efficient\r\nmeans of reducing the aggregate expenses), it will meet with ready\r\nacquiescence. I have consulted intelligent persons of the labouring\r\nclasses, and discussed with them step by step the proposed changes. They\r\nhave unanimously declared that these changes would all be a great gain\r\nto them, especially the proposed reduction of the expenses of\r\ninterments. They have moreover urged that if they were enabled to have\r\nthe funerals performed in a satisfactory manner, at a reduced expense,\r\nthe applications for parochial aid would be proportionately diminished,\r\nthe poorest relations would then subscribe to avert the disgrace of a\r\nparochial interment; a large proportion of the applications for such aid\r\nbeing now made by others than regular paupers, and in consequence of the\r\nhopelessness of their being enabled to defray the heavy expenses which\r\nare at present necessary.\r\n\r\n§ 235. The conclusions before stated are deduced principally from the\r\nfacts obtained by inquiries in the metropolis and the chief towns in the\r\nmanufacturing districts. The information obtained by correspondence from\r\nEdinburgh, Glasgow, Bristol, Birmingham, Coventry, and several towns in\r\nIreland, tends to the conclusion that the leading principles set forth\r\nin this report are applicable to all crowded town districts, with but\r\nfew modifications. In all the practice of interments in towns, the\r\ncrowded state of the places of burial, the apparent want of seclusion\r\nand sanctity pollute the mental associations, and offend the sentiments\r\nof the population, irrespective of any considerations of the public\r\nhealth; in almost all, this state of feeling is manifested by the\r\nincreasing resort of persons of the higher and middle classes to such\r\ncemeteries as have been formed out of the towns by private individuals\r\nwho have associated, and taken advantage of the feelings to procure\r\nsubscriptions for the formation of more acceptable places of sepulture.\r\nIn Manchester and Edinburgh, and a few other towns, the business of the\r\nundertaker does not appear to be on the same footing as in the\r\nmetropolis; the expenses of the funerals to the labouring classes appear\r\nnevertheless to be no less oppressive, and the whole arrangements to\r\nstand in pressing need of regulation. In nearly all the towns where the\r\ngrave-yards are crowded by the burials of an increasing population,\r\nevidence was tendered of outrages perpetrated upon the feelings of the\r\npopulation by the gravediggers in the disposal of undecomposed remains\r\nto make space for new interments. And it follows, from the circumstances\r\nthat these men will not allow their own means of livelihood to be\r\ncurtailed, and will, if they be permitted, or be unwatched, make way by\r\nany means for new interments. The desecrations are suspected, and from\r\ntime to time are discovered. It requires a high order of education and\r\nmental qualification to maintain habitually respect for the inanimate\r\nremains of the dead and regard to the feelings of the living connected\r\nwith them. In the uneducated, any common feelings of respect soon give\r\nway to every-day conveniences, and are at once obliterated by any strong\r\nnecessities. The common tendencies in this respect are attested by the\r\nexamples cited, of careful arrangements made to guard against them. (§\r\n169.) In all the populous provincial towns the need of the superior\r\nsuperintendence of the material arrangements for interment, and the\r\nexercise of such functions as those described as falling to a superior\r\nofficer of public health, appear to be even more urgent than in the\r\nmetropolis. It is, however, an error to suppose that the evils of the\r\nexisting practice of interment are confined to the _larger_ towns. The\r\nburial-ground at Southampton, for example, is represented to me to be\r\nfull; it is moreover not more than one-half of the extent requisite for\r\nthe population of that town, which is about 28,000, and rapidly\r\nincreasing. The authorities there are desirous of obtaining grounds and\r\nestablishing a public cemetery in or near the town, and would, if\r\npracticable, do so without the expense of a private Act of Parliament.\r\nThe grave-yard of the cathedral of Ely, for the burials arising from a\r\npopulation of about 7,000 is reported to be inconveniently full, and the\r\nvery reverend the dean is stated to be extremely desirous of closing it\r\nand procuring a burial-ground at a distance. I have been informed by\r\nseveral ecclesiastical authorities, that the clergy are often much\r\ndistressed by the inadequacy of the old grave-yards to meet the\r\nnecessities of burial for an increasing population. The data already\r\ngiven as to the space required for interments will serve to show the\r\nadequacy or inadequacy of the existing burial-grounds for any\r\npopulation. It may be submitted that provision might be made for the\r\nrelief of any district on the inspection and under the authority of\r\nproperly appointed officers of health, for the provision of new and\r\nseparate places of burial, on applications showing the inadequacy or\r\nunsuitableness of the existing grave-yards.\r\n\r\nIt were a reproach to the country, and its institutions and its\r\ngovernment, and to its administrative capacity, to suppose that what is\r\nsatisfactorily done in the German states may not, now that attention is\r\ndirected to the subject, be generally done at least as well and\r\nsatisfactorily in this country; or that the higher classes would not in\r\nwhatever depends on their voluntary aid, exhibit as good and practical\r\nan example of community of feeling in taking a lead in the adoption of\r\nall arrangements tending to the common benefit, as that displayed in the\r\nstates which have achieved the most satisfactory improvement of the\r\npractice of interment, by well-appointed officers of public health.\r\n\r\n§ 236. I have thought it unnecessary to occupy attention with many\r\ndetails which would appear to follow the adoption of the general\r\nprinciples deducible from the information collected. I have given that\r\ninformation so fully in the text, that I have avoided extending the bulk\r\nof the Report by repeating it with prefatory or connecting matter in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nI would now beg leave to recapitulate the chief conclusions which the\r\ninformation obtained under this inquiry appears to establish. They are—\r\n\r\n\r\n              I. _As to the Evils which require Remedies._\r\n\r\n§ 237. That the emanations from human remains are of a nature to produce\r\nfatal disease, and to depress the general health of whosoever is exposed\r\nto them; and that interments in the vaults of churches, or in\r\ngrave-yards surrounded by inhabited houses, contribute to the mass of\r\natmospheric and other impurities by which the general health and average\r\nduration of life of the inhabitants is diminished. (§ 1 to 23.)\r\n\r\n§ 238. That the places of burial in towns or crowded districts are\r\nusually destitute of proper seclusion or means for impressive religious\r\nservice, and are exposed to desecrations revolting to the popular\r\nfeelings; and that feelings of aversion are manifest in the increasing\r\nremovals or abandonment of family vaults and places of burial, and the\r\npreference, often at increased expense, of interments in suburban\r\ncemeteries, which are better fitted to raise mental associations of\r\ngreater quiet, respect, and security as places of repose. (§ 109.)\r\n\r\n§ 239. That the greatest injury done by emanations from decomposing\r\nremains of the dead to the health of the living of the labouring\r\nclasses, in many populous districts, arises from the long retention of\r\nthe body before interment in the single rooms in which families of those\r\nclasses live and have their meals, and sleep, and where the deaths, in\r\nthe greater number of instances, take place; and that closely successive\r\ndeaths of members of the same family, from the same disease, are very\r\nfrequent amongst the labouring classes; and that, where the disease has\r\nnot been occasioned by the emanations from the first dead body, as\r\nsometimes appears to have been the case, or where the disease has either\r\narisen from a common cause, or may have been communicated before death\r\nfrom the living person, the diseases are apparently rendered much more\r\nfatal by this practice of the retention of the dead body in the one\r\nliving room previous to interment. (§ 24 to 39.)\r\n\r\n§ 240. That this practice of the prolonged retention of the dead in such\r\ncrowded rooms, besides being physically injurious, is morally degrading\r\nand brutalizing. (§ 40 to 42.)\r\n\r\n§ 241. That this practice is frequently the most powerfully influenced\r\nby the difficulty of raising the expenses of funerals, which in this\r\ncountry press grievously on the labouring and middle classes of the\r\ncommunity, and are extravagant and wasteful to all classes, and occasion\r\nsevere suffering and moral evil. (§ 43 to 71.)\r\n\r\n§ 242. That, on the best proximate estimates which have been made, the\r\ntotal amount of the whole of the yearly expenses of funerals in the\r\nmetropolis cannot be less than between six and seven hundred thousand\r\npounds, and for the whole of Great Britain between four and five\r\nmillions sterling per annum. (§ 72 to 74.)\r\n\r\n§ 243. That it appears, upon examination in the metropolis, that\r\nnotwithstanding the great expense of funerals, the existing arrangements\r\nfor conducting them are on an unsatisfactory footing, and that great\r\ndifficulties stand in the way of any efficient amendment, whilst the\r\npractice of interment in the crowded districts is retained. (§ 84 to\r\n89.)\r\n\r\n§ 244. That on the occurrence of a death amongst the poorest classes or\r\namongst strangers, the survivors are commonly destitute of means of\r\nprecaution against oppressive charges and of trustworthy advice or\r\ncounsel, as to the modes of burial such as are afforded by the civic\r\narrangements of other civilized countries. (§§ 121, 122, and vide\r\nAppendix, No. 1.)\r\n\r\n§ 245. That on the occurrence of deaths from preventible causes of\r\ndisease, there are no appointed means for the detection and removal of\r\nthose causes, and that strangers and new-comers, having no warning, are\r\nsuccessively exposed, and frequently fall victims to them. (§ 196.)\r\n\r\n§ 246. That common causes of diseases which ravage the community, of the\r\nextent of operation of which causes it has a deep interest in knowing,\r\npass unexamined and undetected; moreover, that in many districts there\r\nare wide opportunities for the escape of crimes, by which life is also\r\nrendered insecure, chiefly by the omission of efficient arrangements for\r\nthe due verification of the fact and causes of death. (§§ 205 to 215.)\r\n\r\n§ 247. That the numbers of funerals, and intensity of the misery\r\nattendant upon them, vary amongst the different classes of society in\r\nproportion to the internal and external circumstances of their\r\nhabitations: that the deaths and funerals vary in the metropolis from 1\r\nin every 30 of the population annually (and even more in ill-conditioned\r\ndistricts), to 1 in 56 in better-conditioned districts; from 1 death and\r\nfuneral in every 28 inhabitants in an ill-conditioned provincial town\r\ndistrict, to 1 in 64 in a better-conditioned rural district: such\r\ndifferences of the condition of the population being accompanied by\r\nstill closer coincidences in the variation of the span of life, the\r\naverage age of all who die in some ill-conditioned districts of the\r\nmetropolis being 26 years only, whilst in better-conditioned districts\r\nit is 36 years: the variations of the age of deaths being in some\r\nprovincial towns, such as Leicester, from 15 years in the\r\nill-conditioned to 24 years in the better-conditioned districts: and as\r\nbetween town and rural districts 17 or 18 years for the whole population\r\nof Liverpool, and 39 years for the whole population of Hereford; and\r\nthat the total excess of deaths and funerals in England and Wales alone,\r\nabove the commonly attained standards of health, being at the least\r\nbetween thirty and forty thousand annually. (§ 75 to § 80, and district\r\nreturns: Appendix.)\r\n\r\n\r\n II. _As to the Remedies available for the Prevention or Mitigation of\r\n                             these Evils._\r\n\r\n§ 248. That the most effectual and principal means for the abatement of\r\nthe evils of interments are those sanitary measures which diminish the\r\nproportionate numbers of deaths and funerals, and increase the duration\r\nof life. § 75 to § 82, and General Report, p. 370. But—\r\n\r\n§ 249. That on the several special grounds, moral, religious, and\r\nphysical, and in conformity to the best usages and authorities of\r\nprimitive Christianity, § 177, and the general practice of the most\r\ncivilized modern nations, the practice of interments in towns in burial\r\nplaces amidst the habitations of the living, and the practice of\r\ninterment, in churches, ought for the future, and without any exception\r\nof places, or acceptation of persons, to be entirely prohibited. (§ 1 to\r\n§ 23.)\r\n\r\n§ 250. That the necessities of no class of the population in respect to\r\nburial ought to be abandoned as sources of private emolument to\r\ncommercial associations, but that national cemeteries of a suitable\r\ndescription ought to be provided and maintained (as to the material\r\narrangements), under the direction of officers duly qualified for the\r\ncare of the public health. (§ 126.)\r\n\r\n§ 251. That for the avoidance of the pain, and moral and physical evil\r\narising from the prolonged retention of the body in the rooms occupied\r\nby the living, and at the same time to carry out such arrangements as\r\nmay remove the painful apprehensions of premature interments,\r\ninstitutions of houses for the immediate reception, and respectful and\r\nappropriate care of the dead, under superior and responsible officers,\r\nshould be provided in every town for the use of all classes of the\r\ncommunity. (§ 90 to § 101.)\r\n\r\n§ 252. That for the abatement of oppressive charges for funereal\r\nmaterials, decorations, and services, provision should be made (in\r\nconformity to successful examples abroad) by the officers having charge\r\nof the national cemeteries, for the supply of the requisite materials\r\nand services, securing to all classes, but especially to the poor, the\r\nmeans of respectable interment, at reduced and moderate prices, suitable\r\nto the station of the deceased, and the condition of the survivors. (§\r\n186, § 115 to § 120.)\r\n\r\n§ 253. That for these purposes, and for carrying out the physical\r\narrangements necessary for the protection of the public health in\r\nrespect to the practice of interment, officers of health qualified by\r\nmedical education and special knowledge should be appointed. (§ 223.)\r\n\r\n§ 254. That in order to abate the apprehensions of premature interment,\r\n§ 92 to § 96, to bring responsible aid and counsel, and protection\r\nwithin the reach of the most destitute survivors, §§ 121 and 122 and §\r\n198, to protect the people against continued exposure to ascertained and\r\npreventible causes of disease and death, the principle of the early\r\nappointment of searchers be revived, and no interment be allowed to take\r\nplace without the verification of the fact and cause of death by the\r\nofficer of health. (§ 123, 124, 125, 126, to § 216.)\r\n\r\n§ 255. That in all clear and well ascertained cases of deaths from\r\nimmediately removable causes of disease and death, the officers of\r\nhealth be invested with summary powers, and be responsible for\r\nexercising them, for the removal of those causes, and for the protection\r\nof strangers from continued exposure and suffering from them.\r\n\r\n§ 256. That the expenses of national cemeteries should be raised by\r\nloans bearing interest.\r\n\r\n§ 257. That the repayment of the principal and interest should be spread\r\nover a period of [thirty years?]—and be charged as part of the reduced\r\nexpenses for future interments.\r\n\r\n§ 258. That all burial fees and existing dues be collected on interment,\r\nand form a fund from whence be paid the compensations which Parliament\r\nmay award to such existing interests as it may be necessary to disturb,\r\nincluding the payment of the establishment charges, and the principal\r\nand interest of the money expended for the erection of new cemeteries;\r\nand that any surplus which may thereafter accrue may be applied to the\r\nmeans of improving the health of the living.\r\n\r\n§ 259. That, on consulting the experience of those cities abroad where\r\nthe greatest attention has been given to the arrangements for the\r\nprotection of health connected with interments, it appears that by the\r\nappointment of medical officers, unencumbered by private practice, as\r\nofficers of health, and qualified by the possession of appropriate\r\nscience for the verification of the fact and causes of death, and by\r\ncommitting to them the regulation of the service of interments in\r\nnational cemeteries, the several defects above specified may be\r\nremedied, and that new and comparatively salubrious places of burial may\r\nbe procured, together with appropriate religious establishments, wherein\r\nthe funeral service may be better solemnized, and that the expense of\r\nfunerals may be reduced, in the metropolis, at the least, to one-half of\r\nthe existing amount, and full compensation be given to all who may have\r\nlegitimate claims for compensation for losses on the alterations of the\r\nexisting practice. (§ 219 to § 225.)\r\n\r\n§ 260. That the agency of properly qualified officers of health\r\nnecessary for abating the evils of the practice of interments would also\r\nserve powerfully to promote the application of those sanitary measures\r\nwhich in some districts would, there is reason to believe, save more\r\nthan their own pecuniary expense, merely in the diminished numbers\r\ncombined with reduced expenses of funerals, consequent on the practical\r\noperation of comprehensive measures of sanitary improvement. (§ 201.)\r\n\r\n§ 261. The advantages which the measures proposed offer to the classes\r\nwho now stand most in need of a beneficent intervention, may be thus\r\nrecapitulated. To take the poorest class: the labouring man would (in\r\ncommon with the middle and higher classes) gain, on the occasion of his\r\ndemise, protection for his widow and surviving children, that is to say;\r\n\r\n  Protection from the physical evil occasioned by the necessity of the\r\n    prolonged retention of his remains in the living and sleeping\r\n    room:\r\n\r\n  Protection against extortionate charges for interment, and against\r\n    the impositions of unnecessary, expensive, and unseemly funereal\r\n    customs, maintained against the wishes of private individuals and\r\n    families:\r\n\r\n  Protection and redress to his survivors or the living against any\r\n    unfair or illegal practices, should any such have led to the\r\n    death:\r\n\r\n  Protection against any discoverable causes of ill health, should any\r\n    have attached to his abode or to his place of work:\r\n\r\n  Protection from the painful idea (by arrangements preventive of the\r\n    possibility) of a premature interment:\r\n\r\n  Protection of the remains from profanation, either before or after\r\n    interment:\r\n\r\n  Protection such as may be afforded by the information and advice of\r\n    a responsible officer, of knowledge, and station, in the various\r\n    unforeseen contingencies that occur to perplex and mislead the\r\n    prostrate and desolate survivors on such occasions. (§ 191 to §\r\n    207.)\r\n\r\nAdded to these will be the relief from the prospect of interment, in a\r\ncommon grave-yard or charnel, by the substitution of a public national\r\ncemetery, on which the mind may dwell with complacency, as a place in\r\nwhich sepulture may be made an honour and a privilege.\r\n\r\n§ 262. The advantages derivable to the public at large have already been\r\nspecified, in the removal of causes of pain to the feelings of the\r\nliving connected with the common burial places; they would also gain in\r\nthe several measures for protection against the causes of disease\r\nspecified as within the province of an officer of the public health to\r\nremove; and they would also gain in the steps towards the creation of a\r\nscience of the prevention of disease, and in a better registration of\r\nthe fact and the causes of death.\r\n\r\nTo use the words of a great Christian writer,—that all this, which\r\nconstitutes the last office of the living, “to compose the body to\r\nburial,” should be done, and that it should be done well and “gravely,\r\ndecently, and charitably, we have the example of all civilized nations\r\nto engage us, and of all ages of the world to warrant:—so that it is\r\nagainst common honesty, and public fame and reputation not to do this\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\nI would, in conclusion, beg leave to repeat and represent urgently that\r\nHer Majesty’s Government, should only set hands to this great work, when\r\ninvested with full powers to effect it completely: for at present there\r\nappears to be no alternative between doing it well or ill; between\r\nsimply shifting the evil from the centre of the populous districts to\r\nthe suburbs, and deteriorating them; fixing the sites of interments at\r\ninconvenient distances, forming numerous, separate, and weak, and yet\r\nenormously expensive, establishments; aggravating the expense, and\r\nphysical and moral evils of the delay of interment; diminishing the\r\nsolemnities of sepulture; scattering away the elements of moral and\r\nreligious improvement, and increasing the duration and sum of the\r\nexisting evils:—there appears to be no distinct or practicable\r\nalternative between these results and effecting such a change as, if\r\nzealously carried out, will soothe and elevate the feelings of the great\r\nbulk of the population, abate the apprehensions of the dying, influence\r\nthe voluntary adoption of beneficial changes in the practice of\r\nobsequies, occasion an earlier removal of the dead from amidst the\r\nliving to await interment and ensure the impressiveness of the funeral\r\nservice, give additional securities against attempts on life, and\r\ntrustworthy evidence of the fact of death, with the means of advancing\r\nthe protection of the living against the attacks of disease; and at a\r\nreduced expense provide in well arranged national cemeteries places for\r\npublic monuments, becoming the position of the empire amongst civilized\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n                                 I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n\r\n                                             Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                         EDWIN CHADWICK.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  According to a memoir on this subject, read at the Royal Academy of\r\n  Sciences, by M. Cadet de Vaux, in the year 1781, “Le méphetisme qui\r\n  s’etoit dégagé d’une des fosses voisines du cimetière, avoit infecté\r\n  toutes les caves: on comparait aux poisons les plus subtils, à ceux\r\n  dont les sauvages imprégnant leur flèches meurtrières, la terrible\r\n  activité de cette émanation. Les murs baignés de l’humidité dont elles\r\n  les pénétroit, pouvoit communiquer, disoit on par le seul attouchement\r\n  les accidens les plus redoutable.” See Mémoires de la Société Royale\r\n  de Médecine, tom. viii. p. 242; also Annales de Chimie, tom. v. p.\r\n  158. As an instance of the state of the cellars around the grave-yard,\r\n  it is stated, that a workman being engaged in one of them put his hand\r\n  on the wet wall. He was warned that the moisture on the walls was\r\n  poisonous, and was requested to wash the hand in vinegar. He merely\r\n  dried his hand on his apron: at the end of three days the whole arm\r\n  became numb, then the hand and lower arm swelled with great pain,\r\n  blisters came out on the skin, and the epidermis came off.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Vide also, Traité des Maladies des Artisans par Patissier, d’après\r\n  Ramazzini, 8vo.

Paris, 1833, p. 325.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  In the course of some inquiries which I made with Professor Owen, when\r\n  examining a slaughterman as to the effects of the effluvia of animal\r\n  remains on himself and family, some other facts were elicited\r\n  illustrative of the effects of such effluvia on still more delicate\r\n  life. The man had lived in Bear-yard, near Clare-market, which was\r\n  exposed to the combined effluvia from a slaughter-house and a tripe\r\n  factory. He was a bird-fancier, but he found that he could not rear\r\n  his birds in this place. He had known a bird fresh caught in\r\n  summer-time die there in a week. He particularly noted as having a\r\n  fatal influence on the birds, the stench raised by boiling down the\r\n  fat from the tripe offal. He said, “You may hang the cage out of the\r\n  garret window in any house round Bear-yard, and if it be a fresh bird,\r\n  it will be dead in a week.” He had previously lived for a time in the\r\n  same neighbourhood in a room over a crowded burial-ground in\r\n  Portugal-street; at times in the morning he had seen a mist rise from\r\n  the ground, and the smell was offensive. That place was equally fatal\r\n  to his birds. He had removed to another dwelling in Vere-street,\r\n  Clare-market, which is beyond the smells from those particular places,\r\n  and he was now enabled to keep his birds. In town, however, the\r\n  ordinary singing-birds did not, usually, live more than about 18\r\n  months; in cages in the country, such birds were known to live as long\r\n  as nine years or more on the same food. When he particularly wished to\r\n  preserve a pet bird, he sent it for a time into the country; and by\r\n  repeating this removal he preserved them much longer. The fact of the\r\n  pernicious effect of offensive smells on the small graminivorous\r\n  birds, and the short duration of their life in close rooms and\r\n  districts, was attested by a bird-dealer. In respect to cattle, the\r\n  slaughterman gave decided reasons for the conclusion, that whilst in\r\n  the slaughter-house they lost their appetites and refused food from\r\n  the effect of the effluvium of the place, and not, as was popularly\r\n  supposed, from any presentiment of their impending fate. _Vide_\r\n  General Sanitary Report, p. 103, note, and p. 106.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  On the evidence of individual cases the innocuousness of many poisons\r\n  and diseases might be proved. Individuals are sometimes found to\r\n  resist inoculation. It is a singular, and as yet unexplained fact,\r\n  that centenarians are often found in the greatest proportion in times\r\n  and places where the average duration of life of the whole population\r\n  is very low. It has been shown from an accurate registration of\r\n  centuries in Geneva, that as the average duration of life amongst the\r\n  whole community advanced, the proportion of extreme cases of\r\n  centenarians diminished. According to the bills of mortality there\r\n  were nearly three times as many centenarians in London a century ago\r\n  than at present. Out of 141,720 deaths within the bills of mortality\r\n  during the five years ended 1742, the deaths of 58 persons alone of\r\n  100 years and upwards of age are recorded; whilst out of 139,876\r\n  deaths which occurred in the metropolis as returned by the\r\n  registrar-general, during the three years which ended 30th June, 1841,\r\n  only 22 deaths of 100 years of age and upwards are recorded. The\r\n  average age of death of all who died was then 24 years; it is now,\r\n  judging from an enumeration made from the returns of 1839, about 27\r\n  years; and there appears to have been a considerable improvement in\r\n  all periods of life up to 90 years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Appendix of the district returns of the Mortuary Registration.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  In the medical profession examples are not rare of the attainment of\r\n  extreme old age; yet as a class they bear the visible marks of health\r\n  below the average. The registration of one year may be an imperfect\r\n  index; but the mortuary registration for the year 1839 having been\r\n  examined, to ascertain what was the average age of death of persons of\r\n  the three professions, it appears that the average age of the\r\n  clergymen who died in London during that year was 59, of the legal\r\n  profession 50, and of the medical profession 45. Only one medical\r\n  student was included in the registration: had the deaths of those who\r\n  died in their noviciate been included, the average age of death of the\r\n  medical profession would have been much lower.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  An instance in exception of a barber having caught fever is\r\n  subsequently stated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  Two days in the week the London Fever Hospital is open to the friends\r\n  of the patients, who often spend a considerable time in the wards,\r\n  sometimes sitting on the beds of the sick; yet these visitors never\r\n  take fever themselves, nor are they ever known to convey it by their\r\n  clothes to persons out of the hospital. In like manner the persons\r\n  employed to convey the clothes of the fever-patients from the wards of\r\n  the hospital do not take fever, nor is there any evidence whatever\r\n  that typhus fever is, or can be, propagated merely by the clothes; yet\r\n  it is remarkable that the laundresses who wash the clothes, which\r\n  often contain excrementitious matters from the patients, or from the\r\n  dead, of an amount perceptible to the senses, rarely if ever escape\r\n  fever. It is inferred, that in this case the poison is by the heat put\r\n  in a state of vapour, which is inhaled, and being sufficient in\r\n  quantity, produces the disease.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  In the Appendix will be found further particulars and exemplifications\r\n  of the facts, deducible from the mortuary registers, together with the\r\n  returns from the several registration districts in the metropolis, of\r\n  which the above is a summary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix.—Paper on the Mortuary Returns.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Recently, April the 4th, at the Liverpool assizes, a woman named\r\n  Eccles was convicted of the murder of one child, and was under the\r\n  charge of poisoning two others, with arsenic.

Mr. Crabbe thus describes the effect of the funeral array:—\r\n\r\n      Lo! now what dismal sons of darkness come\r\n      To bear this daughter of indulgence home!\r\n      Tragedians all, and well arranged in black!\r\n      Who nature, feeling, force, expression lack;\r\n      Who cause no tear, but gloomily pass by,\r\n      And shake their sables in the wearied eye,\r\n      That turns disgusted from the pompous scene,\r\n      Proud without grandeur, with profusion mean!\r\n      The tear for kindness past affection owes;\r\n      For worth deceased the sigh from reason flows;\r\n      E’en well-feigned passions for our sorrows call,\r\n      And real tears for mimic miseries fall:\r\n      But this poor farce has neither truth nor art,\r\n      To please the fancy or to touch the heart.\r\n\r\n             *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n      Dark but not awful, dismal but yet mean,\r\n      With anxious bustle moves the cumb’rous scene;—\r\n      Presents no objects tender or profound,\r\n      But spreads its cold unmeaning gloom around.\r\n\r\n             *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n      When woes are feigned, how ill such forms appear;\r\n      And oh! how needless when the woe’s sincere.\r\n\r\n                                              _The Parish Register._\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Amongst the higher classes the tendency is to reduce the number of\r\n  cases in which mourning is worn, and to diminish the time of wearing\r\n  it. It would be a great boon to persons in inferior condition and of\r\n  limited means, who are governed by the examples of those above them,\r\n  and who are put to ruinous expense for putting a whole family into\r\n  mourning, at a time when the expense can be the least spared, if the\r\n  custom could be further altered to the wearing of a piece of crape\r\n  only on the hat or on the arm, as in the army and navy; or by limiting\r\n  the wearing of full mourning to the head of the family, and using only\r\n  crape bands for the rest. Some conception may be formed of the\r\n  inconvenience incurred by the extent to which mourning is carried,\r\n  even amongst the poorest classes, if we suppose that on such occasions\r\n  it were necessary to clothe the whole of the men of the army and navy\r\n  in black. The very excess of deaths above a healthy standard in Great\r\n  Britain necessitates mourning to nearly forty thousand families per\r\n  annum. The extent to which custom has carried mourning appears to have\r\n  no Scriptural authority. Bingham, speaking of the primitive\r\n  Christians, states, “that they did not condemn the notion of going\r\n  into a mourning habit for the dead, nor yet much approve of it, but\r\n  left it to all men’s liberty as an indifferent thing, rather\r\n  commending those that either omitted it wholly, or in short time laid\r\n  it aside again, as acting more according to the bravery and philosophy\r\n  of a Christian. Thus St. Jerome commends one Julian (Hieron. Ep. 34 ad\r\n  Julian), a rich man in his time, because having lost his wife and two\r\n  daughters, that is his whole family, in a few days, one after another,\r\n  he wore the mourning habit but forty days after their death, and then\r\n  resumed his usual habit again, and because he accompanied his wife to\r\n  the grave, not as one that was dead, but as going to her rest.\r\n  Cyprian, indeed, seems to carry the matter a little farther; he says\r\n  he was ordered by divine revelation to preach to the people publicly\r\n  and constantly, that they should not lament their brethren that were\r\n  delivered from the world by divine vocation, as being assured that\r\n  they were not lost, but only sent before them: that their death was\r\n  only a receding from the world, and a speedier call to heaven; that we\r\n  ought to long after them and not lament them, nor wear any mourning\r\n  habit, seeing they were gone to put on their white garments in heaven\r\n  (2 Cypr. de Mortal., p. 164). No occasion should be given to the\r\n  Gentiles justly to accuse us, and reprehend us for lamenting those as\r\n  lost and extinct, whom we affirm still to live with God; and that we\r\n  do not prove that faith which we profess in words, by the outward\r\n  testimony of our hearts and souls. Cyprian thought no sorrow at all\r\n  was to be expressed for the death of a Christian, nor consequently any\r\n  signs of sorrow, such as the mourning habits, because the death of a\r\n  Christian was only a translation of him to heaven. But others did not\r\n  carry the thing so high, but thought a moderate sorrow might be\r\n  allowed to nature, and therefore did not so peremptorily condemn the\r\n  mourning habit, as being only a decent expression of such a moderate\r\n  sorrow, though they liked it better if men could have the bravery to\r\n  refuse it.” (Bing., book xxii. chap. 3, sec. 22).\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bently states, that “allowing for much of fiction, with which such\r\n  a subject must ever be mixed, there is still sufficient evidence to\r\n  warrant a diligent examination of the means of discriminating between\r\n  real and apparent death.” (_Ency. Prac. Medicine_, vol. iii. 316.) “As\r\n  respiration is a function most essential to health, and at the same\r\n  time the most apparent, the cessation of it may be considered as an\r\n  indication of death. But as in certain diseases and states of\r\n  exhaustion it becomes very slow and feeble, and so to the casual\r\n  observer to appear quite extinct, various methods have been adopted\r\n  for ascertaining its existence. Thus, placing down or other light\r\n  substances near the mouth or nose; laying a vessel of water on the\r\n  chest, as an index of motion in that cavity; holding a mirror before\r\n  the mouth, in order to condense the watery vapour of the breath; have\r\n  all been proposed and employed, but they are all liable to fallacy.\r\n  Down, or whatever substance is employed, may be moved by some\r\n  agitation of the surrounding air; and the surface of the mirror may be\r\n  apparently covered by the condensed vapour of the breath, when it is\r\n  only the fluid of some exhalation from the surface of the body. We\r\n  therefore agree fully with the judicious observations of Dr. Paris on\r\n  this subject:—‘We feel no hesitation in asserting, that it is\r\n  physiologically impossible for a human being to remain more than a few\r\n  minutes in such a state of asphyxia as not to betray some sign by\r\n  which a medical observer can at once recognize the existence of\r\n  vitality; for if the respiration be only suspended for a short\r\n  interval we may conclude that life has fled for ever. Of all the acts\r\n  of animal life, this is by far the most essential and indisputable.\r\n  Breath and life are very properly considered in the scriptures as\r\n  convertible terms, and the same synonym, as far as we know, prevails\r\n  in every language. However slow and feeble respiration may become by\r\n  disease, yet it must always be perceptible, provided the naked breast\r\n  and belly be exposed; for when the intercostal muscles act, the ribs\r\n  are elevated, and the sternum is pushed forwards; when the diaphragm\r\n  acts the abdomen swells. Now this can never escape the attentive eye;\r\n  and by looking at the chest and belly we shall form a safer conclusion\r\n  than by the popular methods which have been usually adopted.’”\r\n\r\n  The looking-glass and the feather have been the standing test for time\r\n  immemorial. When Lear enters with Cordelia dead in his arms, he says:—\r\n\r\n     “I know when one is dead, and when one lives;\r\n     She’s dead as earth.—Lend me a looking-glass;\r\n     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\r\n     Why, then she lives.\r\n\r\n     _Kent._—Is this the promis’d end?\r\n\r\n     _Edgar._—Or image of that horror?\r\n\r\n     _Lear._—This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so\r\n     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\r\n     That ever I have felt.”\r\n\r\n                             _Shakespeare, King Lear, Act V. Sc. 3._\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix.—Regulations and Plans of the Building, forming part of\r\n  the Institution.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  In a paper read on the 2nd January last before the Academy of Sciences\r\n  at Paris, by M. le Baron Charles Dupin, on the increase of savings’\r\n  banks and their influence on the Parisian population, some most\r\n  startling facts are mentioned in the conclusion, showing the\r\n  deplorable moral condition of a large portion of that population. “Le\r\n  nombre proportionnel des indigents, au lieu d’augmenter, diminue,\r\n  ainsi que celui des bâtards, mais avec lenteur déplorable; au\r\n  commencement de l’époque dont nous résumons les progrès, le peuple de\r\n  Paris abandonnait chaque année 205 enfants sur 1,000 nouveau nés; il\r\n  n’en abandonne plus que 120: c’est beaucoup moins, et pourtant c’est\r\n  _cent vingt_ fois trop. Encore aujourd’hui, le _tiers_ du peuple vit\r\n  dans le concubinage ou dans le libertinage; un _tiers_ de ses enfants\r\n  sont bâtards; un _tiers_ de ses morts expirent à l’hôpital ou sur le\r\n  grabat du pauvre; et ni père, ni mère, ni fils, ni filles, n’ont le\r\n  cœur, pour dernier tribut humain, de donner un cercueil, un linceul,\r\n  au cadavre de leurs proches:—du côté des mœurs, voilà Paris, et Paris\r\n  amélioré!”—It may on this point of comparison be a relief to state,\r\n  the numbers who die in the workhouses in the British metropolis, do\r\n  not exceed 4000 for nearly double the population, and that of these,\r\n  on the average of the last ten years, not more than 293 have been so\r\n  given up or abandoned as to be applicable to the public service in the\r\n  schools of anatomy. The total number who are abandoned in all the\r\n  hospitals of London, for that service, has not, on the average,\r\n  exceeded 168 out of upwards of 2000 deaths per annum. The total number\r\n  of subjects requisite for teaching in the schools of anatomy would be\r\n  about 600. Notwithstanding that the prejudice against dissection has\r\n  much abated, the full number deemed requisite has never been obtained\r\n  of late years from all sources. In some instances, persons of\r\n  education set an example by giving up their own bodies for dissection;\r\n  in some other instances, the use of the remains is obtained by\r\n  persuasions, and the promises of more respectful interment afterwards,\r\n  than could otherwise be obtained. There are actually very few real\r\n  “abandonments” by relations, the greater proportion of cases being of\r\n  persons who have outlived near relations, of whom none, after due\r\n  enquiry, which is always made, can be found. In respect to\r\n  illegitimate births, it appears from the last parliamentary return of\r\n  the number of illegitimate children born in the several counties of\r\n  England (that of Mr. Rickman,) for 1833, that the proportion of\r\n  illegitimate to legitimate births, was in Middlesex, 1 in 38; and in\r\n  Surrey 1 in 40. This was most probably an understatement, but,\r\n  whatever may be the real proportions they are below any comparison\r\n  with the proportions in Paris. The highest proportion of illegitimate\r\n  to legitimate births given in the returns, were those of the county of\r\n  Pembroke, 1 in 8; and Radnor, where it is 1 in 7. It may be important\r\n  to state for the sake of the example, and in illustration of the\r\n  principle, as to the comparative economy of sanitary arrangements that\r\n  this excess of 7,000 miserable deaths and burials per annum in Paris,\r\n  at the least, might be saved by structural sanitary arrangements,\r\n  which would prevent the accumulation of human beings in winding\r\n  streets, (some of which are not more than eight or nine feet wide,)\r\n  under circumstances which render decency, morality, health, or\r\n  contentment impossible. The whole excess of deaths, as well as the\r\n  demoralization that arises from overcrowding, might in all probability\r\n  be saved even by the last vote of expenditure, five millions sterling,\r\n  (which, at English prices, of 100_l._ for a tenement for a family,\r\n  would have provided improved tenements, at improved rents, for fifty\r\n  thousand labourers’ families) for maintaining the war on the Arabs, or\r\n  by the interest of the money expended in building the immense wall and\r\n  fortifications round the dangerous population (kept “desperate,” as\r\n  Jeremy Taylor expresses it, “by a too quick sense of a constant\r\n  infelicity,”) which those works encircle in Paris. In a copy of a\r\n  report of the medical commissioners, appointed to examine the cholera,\r\n  with which I have been favoured by one distinguished member, M.\r\n  Villerme, and in which I have found powerful corroborative evidence on\r\n  the influence of structural arrangements on the health and moral, not\r\n  to speak of the political, condition of the population; they observe,\r\n  “Le fléau qui a pesé si cruellement sur la capitale s’est fait sentir\r\n  d’une manière particulièrement désastreuse dans les quartiers étroits,\r\n  sales et embarrassés de l’ancien Paris; n’y aurait-il pas lieu de\r\n  signaler ici quelques améliorations utiles à introduire dans ces\r\n  localités? Les raisons d’état ont souvent dominé les intérêts\r\n  matériels des villes; autrefois les voies étroites et tortueuses\r\n  appliquées même aux rues pouvait faire partie des moyens de défense à\r\n  l’usage de l’état: aujourd’hui des rues larges et droites deviennent\r\n  dans l’intérieur des villes un premier élément de sécurité publique\r\n  autant que d’hygiène; il y a donc double avantage à favoriser dans ces\r\n  conditions, soit des percements nouveaux, soit l’élargissement des\r\n  voies actuelles.” They give forcible descriptions of population\r\n  analogous to that found—happily in less proportions,—in the worst part\r\n  of our cities, and they also attest, from the examination of the\r\n  inferior population of that capital: “C’est une vérité de tous les\r\n  temps, de tous les lieux, une vérité, qu’il faut redire sans cesse\r\n  parceque sans cesse on l’oublie; il existe entre l’homme et tout ce\r\n  qui l’entoure, de secrets liens, de mystérieux rapports dont\r\n  l’influence sur lui est continuelle et profonde. Favorable, cette\r\n  influence ajoute à ses forces physiques et morales, elle les develope,\r\n  les conserve; nuisible, alors elle les altère, les anéantit, les tue.\r\n  Mais son action n’est jamais plus redoutable que lorsqu’elle trouve à\r\n  s’exercer sur une population entassée, quelle qu’elle soit d’ailleurs,\r\n  et voilà pourquoi l’on observe dans certains arrondissements une\r\n  mortalité plus grande; voilà pourquoi le germe des maladies s’y\r\n  développe plus constamment, pourquoi la vie s’y éteint plus\r\n  rapidement, enfin pourquoi l’on y compte habituellement un décès sur\r\n  trente-deux habitants, quand il n’y en a qu’un sur quarante dans les\r\n  autres.” They also indicate as part of the effects of the noxious\r\n  physical causes the moral depravity and the predominance of bad\r\n  passions which impede amendment. “Ces obstacles sont réels, ils ne\r\n  sauraient être méconnus, mais qui peut douter de les voir s’affaiblir,\r\n  si d’une part la classe aisée de la population, comprenant mieux les\r\n  intentions de l’autorité et ses intérêts véritables, se prête plus\r\n  aisément à l’action des règlements sur la propreté et la salubrité\r\n  publique, et si d’une autre part l’instruction, pénétrant dans cette\r\n  portion de la population qui doit une partie de ses vices et de sa\r\n  misère à l’ignorance, fait naître chez elle, avec des mœurs plus\r\n  pures, des habitudes plus régulières et plus en harmonie avec\r\n  l’hygiène publique?” But these representations of the Medical\r\n  Commissioners of Paris have not been heard by the classes appealed to,\r\n  and relief is sought by the mode of “giving vent” to the dangerous\r\n  passions in preference to the superior treatment recommended, of the\r\n  removal of the physical circumstances by which those passions must\r\n  continue to be generated. Thus it may be mentioned in illustration of\r\n  the important principle of the superior economy and efficiency of\r\n  structural means of prevention, that the expenditure of money on\r\n  Algiers appears to have been upwards of four millions sterling per\r\n  annum, during the twelve years of its occupation. The capital sunk on\r\n  the permanent structural arrangements for supplying London with water\r\n  being about three millions and a half, it may be safely alleged that\r\n  one year’s expenditure on Algiers would have sufficed for the\r\n  structural arrangements for a supply of water for the cleansing of\r\n  every room, and house, and street in Paris; or on the scale of the\r\n  expense of the works completed for supplying Toulouse with water, one\r\n  year’s expenditure on Algiers would have sufficed to supply one\r\n  hundred and fifty towns of the same size as Toulouse with the like\r\n  means of healthful, and thence of moral improvement; or such a sum\r\n  would have sufficed to have effected for ever the “percements et\r\n  enlargissements des voies actuelles,” and thence to have advanced the\r\n  health and achieved the comparative security of four or five such\r\n  cities as Lyons. One year’s cost of any one regiment maintained in the\r\n  war on the Arabs would suffice to build and endow a school, or to have\r\n  constructed between one and two miles of permanent railway. The total\r\n  amount of capital so applied exceeds nearly by one-fourth the amount\r\n  expended on the existing railroads in Great Britain. It may be\r\n  confidently averred that the cost of the forts detaches, or\r\n  _enceintes-continues_, said to be on a reduced scale upwards of ten\r\n  millions sterling, would, if properly directed, with the accessaries\r\n  of moral appliances in addition to such physical means as those\r\n  indicated by the officers of public health, suffice within the period\r\n  of the living generation, to renovate the physical and moral condition\r\n  of the great mass of the population in the interior of that capital.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix—Explanations of the District Mortuary Returns.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ other instances cited in the Annales d’Hygiene.—Number 59, p.\r\n  153 to 159.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  Vide Regulations at Franckfort and Munich, Appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix for the list of burial places returned, and a view of\r\n  the spaces requisite on the preceding scale, § 145, and the relative\r\n  space occupied as burial ground by the chief religious denominations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  It is due to the medical profession to state, that they have always\r\n  discountenanced as injurious the practice of entombment in vaults\r\n  under churches. A Parisian physician had the following epitaph to his\r\n  memory:—\r\n\r\n                    “Simon Pierre, vir pius et probus\r\n                    Hic sub dio sepeliri voluit\r\n                    Ne mortuus cuiquam noceret\r\n                    Qui vivus omnibus profuerat.”\r\n\r\n  At Louvain, there is the tomb of a celebrated anatomist, with the\r\n  following:—\r\n\r\n                    “Philippus Verhagen,\r\n                    Med. Dr. et prof.\r\n                    Partem sui materialem\r\n                    Hic in cœmeterio condi voluit,\r\n                    Ne templum dehonestaret\r\n                    Aut nocivis halitibus inficeret.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  Perpetuities in burial grounds may be said to have been declared\r\n  illegal by Lord Stowell’s decision in the case of Gilbert v. the\r\n  Churchwardens of St. Andrew’s, Holborn, on the use of iron coffins.\r\n  His lordship, in his judgment in that case, remarked, that “All\r\n  contrivances that, whether intentionally or not, prolong the time of\r\n  dissolution beyond the period at which the common local understanding\r\n  and usage have fixed it, is an act of injustice, unless compensated in\r\n  some other way.”—Haggard’s Rep. v. 2, p. 353. _Vide_ statement of the\r\n  principle of this decision, in the extracts from the judgment given in\r\n  the Appendix, No. 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  The neglect of the cemeteries at Paris, and especially of those\r\n  portions dedicated to the interment of the poorer classes, has been\r\n  the subject of public complaint, and means are now being taken to\r\n  redress them. A friend, who aided me with some inquiries in respect to\r\n  them, states,—\r\n\r\n    The English tourist in visiting Père la Chaise is attracted by\r\n    splendid monuments in the midst of cypress trees, and little\r\n    gardens filled with flowers planted round a majority of the tombs;\r\n    but the graves of the humbler classes lie beyond these, and to\r\n    them the stranger is seldom conducted. The contrast is painful.\r\n    When I last visited Père la Chaise, on a fine day in November, and\r\n    after a week of unusually fine weather for the season, I found the\r\n    paths quite impracticable in the poorer quarter of the cemetery,\r\n    and as I watched a man, in the usual blouse dress worn by the\r\n    working class, picking his way through the mud to lead his little\r\n    boy to pray over the grave of his mother, I could but deplore the\r\n    economy of an administration which had neglected to provide, at\r\n    least, a dry gravel path for the humble and pious mourner.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Vide Appendix for an exemplification of the excess of deaths and\r\n  funerals, and other losses incurred by setting aside Sir Christopher\r\n  Wren’s plan for the rebuilding of the city of London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  One of the twelve tables was in these words, “_Hominem mortuum in urbe\r\n  ne sepelito neve urito_.” Cicero, in one of his epistles, Epist. ad\r\n  Div. iv. 12, in which he describes the assassination of his friend M.\r\n  Marcellus, at Athens, mentions that he had been unable to obtain\r\n  permission of the Athenians that the body should be buried in the\r\n  city; they said that such permission was inadmissible on religious\r\n  grounds, and that it never had been granted to any one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  Bingham’s Christian Antiquities, b. xxiii. ch. 1, s. 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  _Vide_ Leviticus, chap. xiv., verse 33 to 48, for early sanitary\r\n  measures of purification.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  It is perhaps an important fact, that the great majority of burials in\r\n  some burial-grounds are stated by the undertakers who perform them to\r\n  be burials of persons who are not subscribing members of the\r\n  congregations who are reputed to be the owners of the grounds, and\r\n  whilst only one out of three of the parishioners of many parishes\r\n  choose burial in the ground belonging to their parish church, the\r\n  solemnization of the marriage ceremony being generally satisfactory to\r\n  the population, and all of them having the option to have the marriage\r\n  solemnized with or without the religious ceremony, only one out of\r\n  twenty-four in the metropolis prefer solemnization elsewhere than at\r\n  the established church. From the Registrar General’s Report it appears\r\n  that, in 1839, out of 18,648 marriages celebrated in the metropolis,\r\n  only 772 were not solemnized in the established church; and out of\r\n  124,329 marriages performed that year in the whole of England and\r\n  Wales, only 7,311 were performed out of the established church.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  Bingham observes that St. Chrysostom speaks against those who use\r\n  excessive mourning at funerals, showing them the incongruity of that\r\n  with this psalmody of the church, and exposing them at the same time\r\n  to the ridicule of the Gentiles. For what said they are these men that\r\n  talk so finely and philosophically about the resurrection? Yes,\r\n  indeed! But their actions do not agree with their doctrine. For whilst\r\n  they profess in words the belief of a resurrection, in their deeds\r\n  they act more like men that despair of it. If they were really\r\n  persuaded that their dead were gone to a better life, they would not\r\n  so lament. “Therefore,” says Chrysostom, “let us be ashamed to carry\r\n  out our dead after this manner. For our psalmody, and prayers, and\r\n  solemn meeting of fathers, and such a multitude of brethren, is not\r\n  that thou shouldst weep and lament, and be angry at God, but give him\r\n  thanks for taking a deceased brother to himself.” St. Jerome also\r\n  frequently speaks of this psalmody as one of the chief parts of their\r\n  funeral pomp. He says at the funeral of the Lady Paula at Bethlehem,\r\n  which was attended with great concourse of bishops and clergy and\r\n  people of Palestine, there was no howling or lamenting as used to be\r\n  among the men of this world, but singing of psalms in Greek, Latin,\r\n  and Syriac (because there were people of different languages present)\r\n  at the procession of her body to the grave.” “And being so general and\r\n  decent a practice, it was a grievance to any one to be denied the\r\n  privilege of it. Victor Uticensis, upon this account, complains of the\r\n  inhuman cruelty of one of the kings of the Vandals. Who can bear, says\r\n  he, to think of it without tears, when he calls to mind how he\r\n  commanded the bodies of our dead to be carried in silence without the\r\n  solemnity of the usual hymns to the grave.” (Vol. vii. 335.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Southwood Smith’s Report, Poor Law Commissioners’ Fifth Annual\r\n  Report, Appendix, p. 160.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Whosoever may feel inclined not to attach much weight to infantile\r\n  mortality on any such theory as that the “pressure of population” is\r\n  thereby diminished, may be requested to consider the evidence of the\r\n  fallacy, and proof that in the very districts where such mortality is\r\n  the greatest, so is the amount of births.

The mixed Church and School Commission has the chief\r\nsuperintendence of all church, cemetery, and interment affairs.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of all matters relating to interments is conferred upon\r\nthe legally-appointed Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\nAll officers employed in connection with interments are placed under the\r\ncontrol of the said Commission, and it will be its duty to report yearly\r\nto the mixed Church and School Commission on the expenses and receipts,\r\nand the general progress of the institution.\r\n\r\n(2.) The superintendence of the cemetery, of the sextons in their\r\nvarious employments, and of the house of reception, is given to an\r\ninspector, whose duties are hereafter described in the 2nd section.\r\n\r\n(3.) For the performance of all the necessary arrangements preceding the\r\ninterment, commissaries of interments are appointed to take the place of\r\nthe so-called undertakers. These commissaries have to arrange everything\r\nconnected with the funeral, and are responsible for the proper\r\nfulfilment of all the regulations given in their instructions.\r\n\r\n(4.) In order to prevent the great expense which was formerly occasioned\r\nby the attendance with the dead to the grave, bearers shall be appointed\r\nwho shall attend to the cemetery all funerals, without distinction of\r\nrank or condition.\r\n\r\nTo these bearers shall be given assistants, who shall be equally under\r\nthe control of the interment commissaries.\r\n\r\n(5.) A sufficient number of sextons and assistants shall be appointed to\r\nform the graves and assist at the interment.\r\n\r\n(6.) There are four classes of funerals and interments. Every house of\r\nmourning may choose the class of funeral on paying the sum fixed for\r\nthat class to the Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\nAll Christian interments, without distinction, can be conducted only\r\naccording to these interment regulations. It remains open to the friends\r\nof the dead to attend the burial either in carriage or on foot; but this\r\nmust be without expense to the house of mourning. The funerals of the\r\ntown guards and of the soldiers of the line remain the same, but are\r\nonly to cost a fixed sum.\r\n\r\nIf it be the wish of a family, the clergyman may attend the funeral, and\r\nhe may perform a service either at the side of the grave, or, in case of\r\nbad weather, in the house of reception.\r\n\r\nAll interments whatsoever, except in extraordinary cases, where the\r\npolice determines the time, must take place early—in summer before nine,\r\nin winter before eleven o’clock, in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe blowing of trumpets from the steeples, the attendance of women with\r\nnapkins, the bearings of crosses, the attendance of the old-fashioned\r\nmourning coach, and also the use of the so-called “chariot of Heaven,”\r\nand the following of young handicraftsmen, which generally were an\r\nimmense expense, are all given up. New carriages of a simpler and more\r\nrespectable form, and such as are better suited to the object and to the\r\ngreater distance of the cemetery from the town, shall be built.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of adults who are taken direct from the house of mourning to\r\nthe grave, must be borne in the funeral carriage to the gate of the\r\ncemetery, where the bearers will convey the coffin to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe dead who have been placed in the house of reception must be borne in\r\nthe same manner to the grave.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases, the dead may be borne to the grave by other\r\npersons; but this is only allowed when there is any particular cause of\r\nsympathy with the dead, or with the surviving family, and it must be\r\nfree of all expense.\r\n\r\n(7.) A complete and exact plan of the new cemetery shall be prepared,\r\nand all the graves shall be marked upon it.\r\n\r\nEvery place of interment must be numbered, which number must be engraved\r\nupon the plan as soon as it is taken.\r\n\r\nThe actuary of the Cemetery Commission shall keep a book, in which is\r\nentered, along with the number of the grave, the rank, age, name, and\r\nsurname of the deceased.\r\n\r\n(8.) Those who possess family vaults, family graves, or monuments,\r\nreceive from the Cemetery Commission a document attesting their right,\r\nand they must also follow the regulations which are contained in it.\r\n\r\n(9.) No grave can be opened till after the lapse of 20 years.\r\n\r\nHence, if a family grave-plot is full, and the oldest grave has not been\r\nclosed 20 years on the occurrence of another death in the family, if it\r\ncannot be placed in the grave-plot of any other relative, it must be\r\ninterred in the general interment ground, in the regular order and\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n(10.) The printed table of the cost of interment determines what sum is\r\nto be paid for funerals to the Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n          SECTION II.—_The duties of the Cemetery Inspector._\r\n\r\n(11.) He is chosen by the Church and Cemetery Commission, and the\r\nappointment is confirmed by the mixed Church and School Commission.\r\n\r\nIn case the latter commission should find reason to delay the\r\nratification, the grounds of the delay are to be reported to the senate,\r\nwhich will then order what is requisite.\r\n\r\nThe oath of the Cemetery Inspector must be taken before the younger\r\n_Herr Bürgermeister_, but his dismissal must be conducted in the same\r\nmanner as his appointment.\r\n\r\nHe must be examined by the Sanitary Board, and must be found by them to\r\nbe qualified. He must also be a burgher.\r\n\r\nThe Cemetery Inspector retains his situation during good behaviour,\r\nexact obedience to the interment regulations, and all other matters\r\ncontained in his instructions.\r\n\r\n(12.) The sextons and their assistants are under the control of the\r\nCemetery Inspector.\r\n\r\nHe has to enforce the regulation that all those employed in the\r\nsolemnities of funerals, or in the house of mourning, shall appear in\r\ngood black clothes, and that no disorder, negligence, or defect, is\r\npermitted in the cemetery.\r\n\r\nHe has further to see that on the part of the sextons, or the gardeners,\r\nthe neatness of the paths of the cemetery is restored after interments,\r\nas also that of the plantations and flower borders, as quickly as\r\npossible, and also that the mounds on the graves in the common ground\r\nare covered with green turf and kept in a pretty form.\r\n\r\n(13.) The interments are to be notified by writing to the inspector of\r\nthe cemetery by the Interment Commissary. This notification must be\r\nsigned by the Church and Cemetery Commission, otherwise the inspector\r\nmay not venture to order the sextons to form a grave.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal duties of the inspector is to keep a register of\r\nall the interments from these notifications, which register he must\r\nweekly lay before the Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\n(14.) The coffins must, without any distinction, be lowered into the\r\ngraves, and the inspector has to see that the necessary ropes are always\r\nin proper condition.\r\n\r\nNo less important is it for the inspector to be present at an interment,\r\nin order that by his presence nothing may be done by his subordinates,\r\nor by any other person, which should be contrary to the dignity of the\r\ninterment or to the regulations.\r\n\r\n(15.) The inspector must also inspect the family vaults, graves, and\r\nmonuments, and keep a book, in which he enters statements of any repairs\r\nwhich may be necessary, and a notification of this is immediately to be\r\nsent to the Church and Cemetery Commission, without whose permission no\r\nalteration can be made in the graves.\r\n\r\n(16.) The inspector has also the superintendence of the house of\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n(17.) It is the duty of the inspector to treat all who have to apply to\r\nhim with politeness and respect, and to give the required information\r\nunweariedly and with ready good will.\r\n\r\nUnder no pretext is he allowed either to demand or receive any payment,\r\nas he has a sufficient salary.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SECTION III.—_On the Interment Commissaries._\r\n\r\n(18.) On the motion of the Church and Cemetery Commission, the\r\nConsistory names four Interment Commissaries for the Lutheran community.\r\n\r\nFor the reformed church in Franckfort two Interment Commissaries are\r\nchosen by the reformed consistory from those proposed by the Church and\r\nCemetery Commission. Amongst those persons proposed by this commission,\r\nthere must be included not only the present clergymen of the two\r\nreformed communities, but the clergyman at all times must be proposed.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic has also an Interment Commissary, chosen by the Church and\r\nSchool Commission from those proposed by the Church and Cemetery\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\nThe list proposed for every such appointment must include, at least,\r\nthree burghers, fit to fill the situation.\r\n\r\nThe appointment is given during good behaviour, and the commissary must\r\ntake an oath that he will truly and exactly follow the regulations, and\r\nthat he feels it his duty to perform all these and any other particular\r\ninstructions which he may receive.\r\n\r\n(19.) To each of the three Interment Commissaries of the Lutheran\r\ncommunity four districts are given, in which they must superintend all\r\nthat has to be done from the death to the interment in their community.\r\n\r\nThe two Reformed commissaries, as well as the Catholic, have to take\r\ncare of everything connected with interment in their communities.\r\n\r\n(20.) In order that illness or any other unavoidable obstacle may not\r\neasily interfere with the function of these commissaries, two Lutheran,\r\none Reformed, and one Catholic commissaries, shall be appointed as\r\nsubstitutes, and shall have the same duties and obligations as their\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\n(21.) These commissaries must notify to each other at what hour they\r\nhave an interment in charge, in order that many interments at the same\r\ntime may be avoided.\r\n\r\n(22.) The commissary is to be informed immediately as soon as a death\r\nhas occurred. Thereon the commissary acquaints the family of the\r\ndeceased with all that is to be done or observed with regard to the\r\ninterment.\r\n\r\nThe commissary must then send to the proper officer a notification of\r\nthe death, and receive the interment certificate, signed by the Church\r\nand Cemetery Commission. If the hour and day of the interment is fixed\r\nby the family of the deceased, the interment commissary informs the\r\nbearers of it the day before, so that if many funerals occurred on one\r\nday, it may be so arranged that no delays or annoyances should take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTimely warning is to be given to the friends of those who are placed in\r\nthe house of reception, of the hour and day of interment, in order that\r\nthey may, if desirous of doing so, attend the funeral.\r\n\r\n(23.) The bearers alone, without any exception, must place the coffin in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe commissary must see that the bearers are always cleanly and\r\nrespectably dressed in black when they appear at a funeral, and must be\r\nparticularly careful that they conduct themselves seriously, quietly,\r\nand respectably.\r\n\r\nHe must also see that the carriage of the dead is not driven quickly\r\neither in the town or beyond it, but that it is conducted respectably at\r\na quiet pace.\r\n\r\nWhen the dead is covered, and not until then, the commissary and the\r\nbearers shall leave the cemetery in perfect silence.\r\n\r\nFor any impropriety which may, through the conduct of the bearers, arise\r\nduring the interment, the commissary is responsible.\r\n\r\n(24.) The commissary must keep a register of the deaths which occur in\r\nhis district. He must close it every month with his signature, and\r\npresent it in the first three days of the following month to the Church\r\nand Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\n(25.) If desired by the family of the deceased to communicate the event\r\nto the friends, the commissary shall do so, and for this he is to be\r\npaid according to the tax. But it is by no means necessary that he\r\nshould be employed, as any other person may be employed to announce the\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n(26.) The substitute must receive half of the sum fixed by the tax-roll\r\nas belonging to the commissary, whose place he fills.\r\n\r\nIf the substitute is employed to announce the death, he receives the\r\nwhole of the remuneration for that service.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Of the Bearers or Attendants of the Funerals._\r\n\r\n(27.) The coffin bearers are chosen by the Church and School Commission,\r\naccording to the sect for which they are to be employed.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of attendants on funerals and their assistants depends\r\non good conduct.\r\n\r\nThey are bound by oath, truly and exactly, to do all that is prescribed\r\nby the interment regulations, as also all that may further be committed\r\nto them by the Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\n(28.) For the interment of the Reformed and Lutheran sects in\r\nFranckfort, there shall be appointed thirty-six attendants of funerals\r\nand twelve assistants.\r\n\r\nThe community in Sachsenhausen has also twelve attendants and six\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nThese attendants and their assistants are chosen from both these\r\nevangelical sects, without regard, however, to the particular number\r\nwhich there may be belonging to the one or the other sect.\r\n\r\nThey are summoned by writing to the performance of their duties at the\r\nfour different classes of funeral by the Interment Commissioner\r\nbelonging to that community, and are subject to the strictest inspection\r\nby that commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic community has also twelve attendants and six assistants.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the attendants and assistants must be citizens or burghers\r\nof Franckfort, or from the neighbourhood, and of unquestionable\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n(29.) On the occasion of every death, whenever they are required, these\r\nbearers must appear in a neat and clean dress, and conduct themselves\r\nrespectfully and quietly.\r\n\r\nThe dress consists of a frock coat, vest, trousers, a round hat,\r\nstockings, and shoes or boots, all of black.\r\n\r\nIn winter is added a black cloak.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the dress must be of a particular form and make.\r\n\r\n(30.) The bearers shall neither eat nor drink in the house of mourning:\r\nthey shall neither ask nor receive, under the strongest penalty, any sum\r\nfor that purpose, since they and their assistants have a fixed and\r\nsufficient salary, according to the interment regulations; any breach of\r\nthis regulation will be punished by dismissal.\r\n\r\nThe assistant will pay half the rate to the bearer. That assistant who\r\nhas signalized himself by the exact fulfilment of his duties, shall be\r\nthe first to be promoted as bearer in case of a vacancy.\r\n\r\nNeglect of duty on the first occasion shall be punished by the Church\r\nand Cemetery Commission with suspension from the office for a certain\r\nlength of time, and on a repetition of the neglect, with dismissal.\r\n\r\nIt is before this commission that the bearers have to bring their\r\ncomplaints, which may sometimes occur, against the Interment Commissary,\r\nunder whose immediate control they are placed, and the matter is there\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n(31.) The Church and Cemetery Commission has to name from amongst the\r\nattendants of the Lutheran and Catholic funerals those who are to be\r\ncross-bearers. These, as well as the bearers, must fulfil most exactly\r\nand conscientiously the orders of the Commissioner of Interments, and\r\nmust only attend when required by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION IV.—_Of the Grave-diggers._\r\n\r\n(32.) The Church and Cemetery Commission appoints the sextons and their\r\nassistants, who are bound by oath to fulfil the regulations and\r\nnecessary arrangements of the Commission.\r\n\r\n(33.) The Church and Cemetery Commission appoints one of the sextons as\r\nchief, who must always live in the town, and to whom the Interment\r\nCommissioner must make known the event of a death, in order that it may\r\nbe notified to the Church and Cemetery Inspector, who thereupon orders\r\nthe preparation of a grave.\r\n\r\nThis chief sexton has a register, in which he enters all the\r\nnotifications of interments that have been sent to him, and which, when\r\nasked for, he must lay before the Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\nNo grave can be prepared, unless the warrant for it has been signed by\r\nthe Church and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\nEvery grave must be six feet deep, three feet and a-half wide, and seven\r\nfeet long for an adult.\r\n\r\nThe measurement for children is regulated by the Church and Cemetery\r\nInspector on each separate occasion. Between the graves in the ordinary\r\ncourse there must be an interval of one foot.\r\n\r\n(34.) The whole of the sextons, in which is included their assistants,\r\nare under the inspection of the Church and Cemetery Inspector, who must\r\nkeep them to their duty, and who is answerable for any misdemeanor, or\r\noffence or neglect of the sextons.\r\n\r\n(35.) The sextons must always be respectably dressed in black during the\r\ninterment, and those who go to the house of mourning must always appear\r\nin neat and clean attire, and must be studious at all times, whether\r\nengaged within or without the churchyard, to preserve a modest and\r\nproper behaviour. Drunkenness, neglect of duty, or abuse of their\r\nservices, will be punished by the Church and Cemetery Commission, and on\r\nrepetition of the offence the offender will be dismissed. The sextons\r\nare forbidden, on pain of dismissal, from making any alteration in any\r\nfamily vault, or grave, or in the ordinary graves, without especial\r\norders. They shall, on the other hand, keep all the flowers, borders,\r\nand shrubs in the neatest order, and one of the sextons must be an\r\nexcellent gardener, whose office it shall be to keep the plantations and\r\nborders in good condition.\r\n\r\nAny assistant who has been guilty of any fault which has led to the\r\ndismissal of the sexton, shall not be able to be employed again as\r\nsexton.\r\n\r\n(36.) The salary for the making of a grave is settled by the Church and\r\nCemetery Commissioners, on the roll, and no more than this sum can\r\neither be demanded or received, under pain of dismissal.\r\n\r\nAn assistant who has to perform the work of a sexton on account of\r\nsickness, must give the sexton half the remuneration. In case the sexton\r\nallows the assistant to do his work, or, on occasion of increased work\r\nrequiring the employment of an assistant, the assistant must receive the\r\nfull pay.\r\n\r\nThat assistant who has signalized himself by the exact and excellent\r\nperformance of his duties, shall be the first to be promoted when a\r\nvacancy occurs.\r\n\r\nWhen the qualifications are equal, the assistant of the longest standing\r\nshall be promoted, and when this is equal, the oldest shall be made\r\nsexton.\r\n\r\nThe complaints of the sextons and assistants against the Inspector or\r\namongst themselves are to be settled by the Church and Cemetery\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _Of the Cost of Interment._\r\n\r\nThe Church and Cemetery Commission undertake to conduct the interments\r\nat the price fixed by them in the tax roll.\r\n\r\nThe whole rates could only be made so moderate, by making all interments\r\nto depend on the Church and Cemetery Commission, therefore the\r\nsolemnities of interment can be superintended by no one except the said\r\nCommission, under the regulation of the printed orders.\r\n\r\nThe Interment Commissioner, on the occasion of a death, must call the\r\nattention of the friends to these orders. It depends entirely on the\r\nchoice of the friends to which of the four classes of prices the funeral\r\nshall belong.\r\n\r\n(39.) The Commission of Interments has to receive the payment for the\r\ninterment from the friends, and must immediately pay it over to the\r\nChurch and Cemetery Commission.\r\n\r\n(40.) Besides, or in addition to the authorized payment printed in the\r\ntax roll, and determined by the Church and Cemetery Commission as the\r\nsufficient remuneration of the Inspector, Commissioner of Interments,\r\nthe bearers and sextons, no one is, on the occasion of a death, either\r\nto give money or to furnish food and drink.\r\n\r\nThe practice of furnishing crape, gloves, lemons, &c., by the friends of\r\nthe dead, is also given up, and the persons engaged in conducting the\r\ninterment, must take all the requisites with them, without asking or\r\nreceiving any compensation, under pain of instant dismissal.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _The time which these orders are to remain in force._\r\n\r\n(41.) Experience will best show what alteration is necessary in these\r\nregulations, and they are therefore after some years to be laid by the\r\nmixed Church and School Commission before the Senate for revision, and\r\nfurther regulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The rate of Interment for the Christian communities of the free town of\r\n                              Franckfort._\r\n\r\nThe following, by order of the Legislative Assembly, of the 31st May,\r\n1836, is the table of the rate of interment, which is here made known\r\nfor every one’s observance and obedience.\r\n\r\nThe interments of adults are divided into four classes:—\r\n\r\n                                             English Money.\r\n                                              £.  _s._ _d._\r\n            The 1st class costs 50 florins =    4    7    6\r\n            The 2nd class costs 36 florins =    3    3    0\r\n            The 3rd class costs 22 florins =    1   18    6\r\n            The 4th class costs 15 florins =    1    6    3\r\n\r\nThe interment of children are also of four classes:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _First Class._                   English Money.\r\n                                                      £.  _s._ _d._\r\n    Children from 10 to 15              22 florins =    1   18    6\r\n    Children from  5 to 10              16 florins =    1    8    0\r\n    Children from  0 to  5              12 florins =    1    1    0\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Second Class._\r\n\r\n    Children from 10 to 15              16 florins =    1    8    0\r\n    Children from  5 to 10              11 florins =    0   19    3\r\n    Children from  0 to  5               8 florins =    0   14    0\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Third Class._\r\n\r\n    Children from 10 to 15              10 florins =    0   17    6\r\n    Children from  5 to 10               8 florins =    0   14    0\r\n    Children from  0 to  5               4 florins =    0    7    0\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Fourth Class._\r\n\r\n    Children from 10 to 15  6 florins              =    0   10    6\r\n    Children from  5 to 10  5 florins              =    0    8    9\r\n    Children from  0 to  5  2 florins 30 kruitzers =    0    4    4\r\n\r\nFor the funeral of all the city militia and officers of the line, twelve\r\nflorins must be paid for the cross, the pall, and the making of the\r\ngrave, inclusive of the carriage, by the friends of the dead.\r\n\r\nThe interment of a pauper will cost six florins, eight kruitzers.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the interments of the institution for paupers are\r\nsettled by the Church and Cemetery Commission, with the officers of that\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nIf the Interment Commissary be employed by the friends of the deceased,\r\nto announce the occurrence of the death, he is to receive three guilders\r\nper day.\r\n\r\n\r\n SECTION V.—_The Regulations with regard to the House for the reception\r\n                             of the Dead._\r\n\r\nThe following are the regulations regarding the use of the house for the\r\nreception and care of the dead, which are here made known for every\r\none’s observance.\r\n\r\n(1.) The object of this institution is—\r\n\r\n  _a._ To give perfect security against the danger of premature\r\n  interment.\r\n\r\n  _b._ To offer a respectable place for the reception of the dead, in\r\n  order to remove the corpse from the confined dwellings of the\r\n  survivors.\r\n\r\n(2.) The use of the reception-house is quite voluntary, yet, in case the\r\nphysician may consider it necessary for the safety of the survivors that\r\nthe dead be removed, a notification to this effect must be forwarded to\r\nthe younger burgermeister to obtain the necessary order.\r\n\r\n(3.) Even, in case the house of reception is not used, the dead cannot\r\nbe interred until after the lapse of three nights, without the proper\r\ncertificate of the physician that the signs of decomposition have\r\ncommenced. In order to prevent the indecency which has formerly\r\noccurred, of preparing too early the certificate of the death, the\r\nphysician shall in future sign a preliminary announcement of the\r\noccurrence of death, for the sake of the previous arrangements necessary\r\nfor an interment, but the certificate of death is only to be prepared\r\nwhen the corpse shows unequivocal signs of decomposition having\r\ncommenced. For the dead which it is wished to place in the house of\r\nreception, the physician prepares a certificate of removal. This\r\ncertificate of removal can only be given after the lapse of the\r\ndifferent periods, of six hours; in sudden death, of twelve hours; and\r\nin other cases, twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nIn case of the thermometer being below 10 degrees of Reaumur, (30\r\nFahrenheit), removal can only take place when there are unequivocal\r\nsigns of death, and under the certificate of death from the physician.\r\n\r\n(4.) The custody and treatment of the dead in the house of reception is\r\nthe same for all ranks and conditions.\r\n\r\n(5.) The superintendence of the house of reception is conferred upon the\r\nInspector of the Church Yard. He must possess the requisite medical and\r\nsurgical knowledge, and must be examined by the Sanitary Board with\r\nregard to his qualification for the office, and must be instructed\r\naccording to their direction.\r\n\r\n(6.) The guardians of the dead are under the control of the inspector,\r\nand must receive a special instruction with regard to their duties.\r\n\r\n(7.) The dead which are placed in the house of reception must not be\r\ninterred until unequivocal signs of decomposition have appeared.\r\n\r\nThe inspector determines the time of interment.\r\n\r\n(8.) The dead, on arrival at the house of reception, are immediately\r\nplaced in separate rooms, which are built for that purpose, and which\r\nare numbered, and there receive all the proper means of security.\r\n\r\n(9.) In the house of reception, there are besides these rooms two other\r\nchambers; one is used as the animating chamber, the other, as a bath\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThe kitchen, which is also near at hand, is used to furnish hot water,\r\nor whatever may be required.\r\n\r\n(10.) In case a body gives signs of re-animation, it must be brought\r\nimmediately into the chamber used for that purpose, when all the means\r\nwill be applied by the inspector, according to the instructions he has\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n(11.) This chamber, in which there is a bed, must always be carefully\r\nlocked, in order that it may never be used for any other purpose. The\r\ninspector alone has possession of the key of this chamber.\r\n\r\n(12.) There must be in this chamber every necessary provision of\r\nmedicines, and of means of resuscitation and proper ventilation of the\r\nair, according to the instruction of the Sanitary Board, and all these\r\narrangements must be kept in most perfect order by the inspector.\r\n\r\n(13.) If any particular case occurs in the house of reception, the\r\nSanitary Board must immediately have information of it, and the Board\r\nmust from time to time examine into the state of the house.\r\n\r\n(14.) Permission to friends and relatives to enter the rooms of the dead\r\nis not granted unconditionally, on account of considerations of health,\r\nbut it depends upon the consent of the inspector. Entrance into the\r\nwaiting hall, from which the rooms in which the dead are deposited\r\nrange, is at all times allowed to the relatives of the dead.\r\n\r\n(15.) A register is kept in the house of reception, in which is entered\r\nthe rank and name of the dead, the age, the last disease, the day and\r\nhour of the death, the placing in the house of reception, and the time\r\nof interment, and the name of the last physician. Every registration is\r\nsigned by the inspector.\r\n\r\n(16.) No payment is made for reception and guarding of the dead in the\r\nhouse of reception, nor for the services of the inspector or nurses, nor\r\nfor the heating of the chambers. These expenses are defrayed from the\r\nInterment Fund.\r\n\r\n(17.) The inspector and nurses are strictly forbidden to allow any\r\npersons to visit them in the buildings of the burial ground.\r\n\r\n(18.) When the inspector has been examined by the Sanitary Board, as to\r\nhis special qualifications, and has passed, the oath is administered to\r\nhim by the younger burgermeister.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Instructions to the Inspector in regard to the House of Reception._\r\n\r\n(1.) The inspector must be examined as to his medical and surgical\r\nknowledge, by the Sanitary Board, and as to his treatment of suspended\r\nanimation, in which he is specially instructed by the Sanitary Board,\r\nand is then sworn in by the younger burgermeister.\r\n\r\n(2.) The inspector has to instruct his assistants, and must see that his\r\ninstructions are strictly followed.\r\n\r\n(3.) He must answer for all that is out of order in the house of\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n(4.) As long as there are corpses in the house, the inspector must not\r\nleave his house.\r\n\r\n(5.) He has to keep a register, in a form which is prescribed, and must\r\npunctually and clearly fill up all the heads of the form.\r\n\r\n(6.) As soon as a corpse is brought to the house, the inspector must\r\ndetermine in which of the rooms it is to be placed, and order all the\r\nnecessary arrangements and means of security, and the attendance of\r\nguardians, and must not leave the dead until everything has been\r\narranged for its proper protection and care.\r\n\r\n(7.) The Cemetery Inspector must superintend the attendants night and\r\nday.\r\n\r\n(8.) No corpse can be interred until unequivocal signs of decomposition\r\nhave appeared. On this matter the inspector has to act according to the\r\ninstructions of the Sanitary Board.\r\n\r\n(9.) Should the case arise, that the dead sets in motion the alarum, or\r\nthat the nurses perceive a slight colour in the cheek, or a slight\r\nbreathing, or a movement in the eye-lid, the inspector must immediately\r\narrange that the body be brought into the fresh air of the re-animating\r\nchamber, which is properly warmed, and he will there adopt all the other\r\nmeans, on which he has received instructions from the Sanitary Board.\r\n\r\n(10.) When these signs of life have appeared, the inspector must\r\nimmediately give information of the circumstance by a messenger to the\r\nphysician who last attended the person, in order that a notification of\r\nthe same may be made to the _Physikat_.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of the re-animation shall be conveyed to the house of\r\nmourning by the physician alone, and then only when there is no longer\r\nany doubt of the resuscitation.\r\n\r\n(11.) One of the first essentials in the house is cleanliness. The\r\nCemetery Inspector has therefore strictly to watch that everything which\r\nbelongs to the house is kept most perfectly clean by the nurses.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the purity of the air, he must see that the\r\narrangements for ventilation are kept in perfect order.\r\n\r\n(12.) He must also see that the rooms are properly warmed during the\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\n(13.) The Cemetery Inspector is not specially paid for his services in\r\nthe house of reception, but has a house free, besides the salary\r\ndetermined by the Cemetery Commission, and printed in the salary table.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Instructions in respect to the Watchers or Nurses._\r\n\r\n(1.) The nurses, amongst which the sextons may be sometimes employed,\r\nare named and appointed by the Church and Cemetery Commission, on good\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\n(2.) They are under the superintendence of the Cemetery Inspector, and\r\nmust obey his orders with the greatest exactitude and alacrity.\r\n\r\n(3.) As soon as a corpse is brought to the house the nurses must convey\r\nit immediately into the room pointed out by the inspector, and\r\nafterwards do all that is required of them by him.\r\n\r\n(4.) They must be instructed in all their duties by the inspector.\r\n\r\n(5.) He, whose week it is to watch in the warder’s chamber, must never\r\nleave the chamber when there are corpses in the rooms, on pain of\r\ninstant dismissal; but if anything requires him to leave the chamber, he\r\nmust first summon with a bell, one of the other nurses to take his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n(6.) The nurses must keep everything in the house in the greatest\r\ncleanliness. Any one who has frequently to be reminded of his duties\r\nthrough carelessness shall be dismissed from the situation.\r\n\r\n(7.) If roughness be shown by a nurse to the dead, he must be punished\r\nwith instant dismissal, and a notification of the same must be given by\r\nthe Church and Cemetery Commission to the police, in order that proper\r\ninquiry and punishment be given.\r\n\r\n(8.) In case the alarum is set in motion, or any other sign of life is\r\nperceived, the nurse must immediately inform the Inspector, and quietly\r\nand gently fulfil all his directions.\r\n\r\n(9.) The nurses are forbidden to use tobacco in the house.\r\n\r\n(10.) They are forbidden to receive any visits in the house, and more\r\nespecially to allow any person to come during the night into the\r\nward-chamber.\r\n\r\n(11.) There shall be in the warder’s chamber a clock, which, by a\r\ncertain mechanism, can tell when, and how long a nurse may have slept\r\nduring the night. Frequent negligence of this kind will be punished by\r\ndismissal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT ELEVATION OF THE ENTRANCE, AND THE BUILDINGS\r\nATTACHED TO THE ENTRANCE, OF THE CHRISTIAN CEMETERY AT\r\nFRANCKFORT-ON-THE-MAINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF THE ENTRANCE OF THE INSTITUTION FOR THE\r\nRECEPTION AND CARE OF THE DEAD, ATTACHED TO THE CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRANSVERSE SECTION OF THE PROBATIONARY HOUSE OF RECEPTION\r\nAND CARE OF THE DEAD PREVIOUS TO INTERMENT AT THE CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF THE PROBATIONARY HOUSE OF\r\nRECEPTION AND CARE OF THE DEAD PREVIOUS TO INTERMENT AT THE CEMETERY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 2.\r\nREGULATIONS FOR THE EXAMINATION AND CARE OF THE DEAD, AND FOR RELIEVING\r\n     THE APPREHENSIONS OF PREMATURE INTERMENTS, PROVIDED AT MUNICH.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Regulations for the Examination of the Dead._\r\n\r\nWhereas it is of importance to all men to be perfectly assured that the\r\nbeings who were dear to them in life are not torn from them so long as\r\nany, the remotest, hope exists of preserving them; so is death less\r\ndreadful in its shape when one is convinced of its actual occurrence,\r\nand no longer a danger exists of being buried alive.\r\n\r\nIn order to afford this satisfaction to mankind, and to preclude the\r\npossibility of any one being considered as dead who is not actually so;\r\nthat the spread of infectious disorders be avoided as much as possible;\r\nthat the quackeries so highly injurious to health may be suppressed;\r\nthat murders committed by secret violence may be discovered, and the\r\nperpetrators delivered over to the hands of justice, is the imperative\r\nduty of every wise government; and in order to accomplish these objects,\r\nevery one of which is of infinite importance, recourse must be had to\r\nthe Safety Police as the most efficient means, by a strict medical\r\nexamination into the deaths occurring, and a conformable view of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of which, the orders already existing on this subject\r\nwill undergo a strict examination, and, with the august consent of the\r\ngovernment of the Isar-Circle, the following general regulations have\r\nbeen fixed upon:—\r\n\r\n1. An examination of all dead bodies, at two different times, and this\r\nwithout exception to rank, is henceforth to take place in the\r\nmetropolitan city of Munich, and the suburbs belonging thereto.\r\n\r\n2. The first examination is to be held immediately after death has taken\r\nplace, and the second shortly before the interment.\r\n\r\n3. At the public hospitals, both examinations are intrusted to the\r\nacting physician, who has however strictly to observe those regulations\r\nrelating to the certificates for the examination of the dead.\r\n\r\n4. The first examination is to take place at the very spot where death\r\nhas taken place, or where any dead body may be discovered, by the sworn\r\nsurgeon of the district: the second examination, however, by the surgeon\r\nappointed by and belonging to the Police Establishment.\r\n\r\n5. The city of Munich, with the suburbs, are to be divided into Eight\r\nDistricts; for each of these districts a separate surgeon is hereby\r\nappointed, viz.:—\r\n\r\n[Here follow the eight districts, with the names and residences of the\r\nSurgeons appointed for each district.]\r\n\r\n6. As soon as a death takes place, immediate notice must be given by the\r\nSoul-nuns, Midwife, &c., &c., or by any such person charged with the\r\narrangements for the burial. This said notice must state the street, the\r\nnumber of the house, and of the floor where the dead body is lying;\r\nwhereupon the said surgeon has immediately to go there, and conduct the\r\ninvestigation according to his instructions.\r\n\r\n7. Previous to this, and before the first examination has taken place,\r\nit is neither permitted to undress nor to clean the dead body: nor is\r\nthe body allowed (in cases of natural death) to be carried out of that\r\nroom where death has taken place, or to be removed from the spot; and it\r\nis not even permitted to remove the cushions from under the head of the\r\ndead body. Every violation of this decree will be punished with a fine\r\nof from 5 to 15 florins, or with imprisonment from one to three days.\r\n\r\n8. Those regulations issued by the examining surgeon respecting the\r\ntreatment of the dead body, or which relate to the clothes and other\r\nobjects of the deceased, must be strictly obeyed.\r\n\r\n9. After the examining surgeon has convinced himself that every hope of\r\nre-animation has disappeared, he fills up the certificate of examination\r\naccording to his instructions; but be it observed at the same time, that\r\nif a medical man has attended the deceased, such is bound to enter in\r\nthe said certificate the description of the disease, and to certify it\r\nby his signature.\r\n\r\n10. If the dead body remains in the dwelling-house until the burial\r\ntakes place, the second examination by the surgeon from the Police must\r\nbe held there; and for this reason the certificate must be forwarded\r\ninto his hands as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n11. But if the dead body after the first examination has been removed to\r\nthe house for the reception of the dead, in order to remain there, this\r\nsaid certificate should previously, or at the delivery, be taken to the\r\nInspector of his Institution, in order that no obstacle may arise to its\r\nreception.\r\n\r\n12. The utmost cleanliness and greatest order is to prevail in this said\r\nhouse for the reception of the dead, where the dead bodies removed there\r\nare to be placed under a perpetual and proper watch; and the Police\r\nSurgeon is bound to call at the Institution twice every day, namely, in\r\nthe morning and in the evening, to institute a very minute examination\r\nof the dead bodies there; and in case of any signs of re-animation, to\r\nrender speedy and the most serviceable assistance.\r\n\r\n13. If the medical man who conducts the second examination perceives\r\nthose signs in a corpse which do not leave any doubt whatsoever that a\r\ndeath has taken place, he then enters the verification in the\r\ncertificate, which thereupon is taken to the Directory of Police, who\r\nthen grant the permission for the interment.\r\n\r\n14. Without such a legal certificate permitting it, no body is allowed\r\nto be buried; and that Priest or Clergyman who will assist at any burial\r\nwithout having seen this certificate forfeits a sum from 15 to 30\r\nflorins.\r\n\r\n15. Proper arrangements have been made that the Printed Forms for the\r\ndecreed Certificates may always be obtained at the Directory of Police,\r\nand will be delivered gratis to the officiating medical men of the\r\nPublic Hospitals, as well as to the Examining Surgeons; a receipt\r\nhowever must be given for them.\r\n\r\n16. All those persons nominated for the execution of these measures, as\r\nthe Soul-nuns, Midwives, attendants at the house for the reception of\r\nthe dead; the Inspector of such House, the Examining Surgeons, the\r\nSurgeons of the Police, &c., &c., will be supplied with the printed\r\nregulations, as well as the most minute instructions, for which purpose\r\nthey will be sworn, and be ever subject to a rigorous inspection.\r\n\r\n _Munich, Nov. 20, 1821._\r\n\r\n   [The regulations which follow this are chiefly as to the different\r\n         prices of different degrees of the religious service.]\r\n\r\n\r\n _Regulations for the Guards or Watchers at the House for the reception\r\n  of the Dead near the Burial Ground at Munich, with reference to the\r\n                      Inspection of Dead Bodies._\r\n\r\n1. There must be at least two health-worthy and active men, as trusty as\r\npossible, appointed as Body Watchers, and specially sworn in by the\r\nPolice.\r\n\r\n2. When a body is intended to be placed in the house for the reception\r\nof the dead, it must be previously notified to the Inspector of the\r\nsame, and the before-mentioned “Examination Ticket,” or a special\r\nofficial order, be delivered over to him.\r\n\r\n3. It is forbidden to the Body Watchers to place any body there without\r\nthe previous knowledge and concurrence of the Inspector.\r\n\r\n4. Should no obstacle arise, the corpse is then received by the Body\r\nWatchers, and deposited in the place appropriated to it.\r\n\r\n5. The cover of the coffin must then be immediately withdrawn, the face\r\nof the deceased uncovered, and the hands and feet disengaged from the\r\nbandages attached to them.\r\n\r\n6. The place where the bodies are watched must be kept warm day and\r\nnight, and lighted during the night without interruption.\r\n\r\n7. Great cleanliness is to be observed, and a supply of pure air to be\r\nkept up.\r\n\r\n8. The Watchers must constantly remain in the watch-room, and frequently\r\nby day and night enter the room for the reception of the dead, in order\r\ncarefully to observe the bodies lying there.\r\n\r\n9. The Police Surgeons will particularly instruct the Body Watchers as\r\nto what signs or appearances they are especially to observe, and how\r\nthey are to act with regard to them. On this point they are to take the\r\ngreatest care.\r\n\r\n10. Should any sign or appearances which may betoken re-animation\r\nproceed from any body, it must be immediately brought into the\r\nwatch-room with every care and precaution, and placed on the bed\r\nprovided with mattrasses and blankets for that purpose.\r\n\r\n11. On such an event occurring, not only the Inspector must be informed\r\nof it, but the Police Surgeon must be called in without a moment’s\r\ndelay.\r\n\r\n12. As to the treatment of the body until the arrival of the Surgeon,\r\nthe Inspector and Body Watchers are informed by the Police Surgeon. In\r\nall cases must warm water be prepared, and the safety apparatus\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n13. The body, thus awakened from its sleep, must be treated with extreme\r\ncare, and everything must be avoided likely to create any strong\r\nimpression on it.\r\n\r\n14. No coffin wherein a body is placed must be closed, nor must any\r\npreparation for the burial take place, until the distinct permission\r\nfrom the Police Surgeon is issued.\r\n\r\n15. The entrance into the room for the reception of the dead is allowed\r\nto every one under proper restrictions, care being taken that the quiet\r\nand good order there are not disturbed.\r\n\r\n16. Any Body Watcher who shall be convicted of any neglect in the\r\nperformance of his duties, will be punished with a proportional fine and\r\nimprisonment, and dismissed on a repetition of the offence.\r\n\r\n _Munich, Nov. 20, 1821. Royal Police Direction._\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Regulations for the Proceedings at the Second Examination of the\r\n        Corpses by the proper nominated Surgeon of the Police._\r\n\r\n1. The second examination of the deceased must be performed by the\r\nappointed Police Surgeon, who must, however, take particular pains to\r\nsatisfy himself that the first examination has been duly executed, that\r\nthe certificates were properly drawn up, that the Soul-nuns have\r\nfulfilled their various duties, and that both the Inspector, as well as\r\nthe appointed Watchmen belonging to the house for the reception of the\r\ndead, have duly discharged the duties with which they are intrusted, and\r\nthat, moreover, nothing has been undertaken or omitted that should not\r\nbe in accordance with the various intents and purposes of the decreed\r\nexamination of the bodies.\r\n\r\n2. This said Surgeon must be supplied with a copy of all the regulations\r\nrelating to the examination of the bodies, as well as copies of all such\r\nregulations for the guidance of all others charged with the performance\r\nof any of these duties.\r\n\r\n3. If the Surgeon who is appointed by the Police feels convinced that by\r\none person or other any act has been performed contrary to the\r\nprescribed duties, or that any negligence in the execution of the\r\nservice exists, he must, on pain of personal responsibility, give\r\nimmediate notice to the Police.\r\n\r\n4. The same (the Police Surgeon) is bound to issue proper instructions,\r\nmore particularly to the Soul-nuns, to the Inspector of the house for\r\nthe reception of the dead, and to the Watchers and attendants of the\r\nsaid institution, as well as to all individuals assisting at any of the\r\nexaminations; which said instructions relate to the method of\r\nproceeding, and treatment of the dead bodies, especially in such a case\r\nwhere re-animation might again take place, and repeated caution must be\r\ngiven on this subject.\r\n\r\n5. The second examination with which he is charged must either be\r\nundertaken in that house where death has taken place, or in the house\r\nfor the reception of the dead. In the first case, when, for instance,\r\nthe deceased is kept at the house where death has taken place until the\r\nfinal interment, the Police Surgeon must receive the necessary\r\ninformation through the medium of the examining ticket, which has been\r\nissued and signed by the medical man of the district, and which ticket\r\nmust be forwarded to him, either through the Soul-nun, or through any\r\nsuch person charged to attend the deceased.\r\n\r\n6. The stated sickness, or the manner how death ensued, as also the time\r\nin which deceased is to be buried; all of which, having been entered on\r\nthe ticket, must serve him for guidance whether the second examination\r\nmust be more or less accelerated. In all cases, however, such must be\r\nundertaken as timely as possible, so that generally interment may take\r\nplace after 48 hours.\r\n\r\n7. He has, accordingly, to go to that place stated in the certificate of\r\nexamination, examine the corpse with due minuteness, and, in case the\r\nburial may be proceeded with, he has to state it in the certificate;\r\nsuch is then to be forwarded to the Royal Police, where the permission\r\nfor interment is granted.\r\n\r\n8. If it is intended to remove the body to the house for the reception\r\nof the dead, such may take place without any hesitation after the\r\nproceedings of the first examination; and in this case the Police\r\nSurgeon must find both the body and certificate at that place.\r\n\r\n9. The Police Surgeon is bound to attend twice every day at the house\r\nfor the reception of the dead of the burial-ground, viz., every morning\r\nfrom 9 to 10 o’clock, and in the afternoon from 3 to 4 o’clock. On his\r\narrival, such dead bodies, with their certificates, which have been\r\nexamined, must be shown to him; he examines them, and signs those\r\ncertificates which do not admit of any delay; which certificates are\r\nafterwards forwarded to the Royal Police authorities, in order to\r\nprocure the certificate of permission for the burial.\r\n\r\n10. Of all such dead bodies having undergone the second examination by\r\nthe Police Surgeon, and which have been considered by him proper for\r\nburial, minute lists must be kept by him containing the consecutive\r\nnumbers, as well as the statement of that day on which the interment has\r\nbeen ordered, and all such observations which have been entered in the\r\ncertificate of examination.\r\n\r\n11. Such corpses which from the manner of their death are subject to any\r\njudicial examination or dissection, will, after their previous\r\ndissection, be received by the proper judicial authorities, and the\r\ninterment is to take place according to the existing orders.\r\n\r\n12. Should information be forwarded to the Police Surgeon that signs of\r\nre-animation have been observed in any body, it is to be his first and\r\nmost sacred duty to attend instantly at the place and spot, in order to\r\nconduct all attempts at restoration, and to issue orders about the mode\r\nof treatment of the re-animated body.\r\n\r\n13. Attending minutely to his duties, it is certain that he may perceive\r\ndivers symptoms which are not only important to him as Examining\r\nSurgeon, but also as surgeon to the Police; he has therefore to attend\r\nminutely to such observations, and, together with his own, communicate\r\nsuch to his superior authorities.\r\n\r\n14. In case the Police Surgeon should be prevented, either by\r\nindisposition, absence, or any other cause, from conducting the\r\nexaminations with which he is intrusted, he is forthwith to give\r\nimmediate notice to the Royal Police, in order to provide for a proper\r\nsubstitute, whom he may himself propose.\r\n\r\n15. It is fully expected from the Surgeon of the Police, that, impressed\r\nwith the importance of the business he is charged with, he will do all\r\nin his power to attain the manifold important objects belonging to it.\r\nAny negligence of which he may be guilty will be rigorously punished,\r\nand on a repetition of the offence he will be discharged.\r\n\r\n _Royal Police Direction, Munich._\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Instructions to the Soul-Nuns as to their Duties in regard to the\r\n                        Inspection of the Dead._\r\n\r\n(1.) As soon as a person is dead, or appears to be so, the nurse or\r\nsister of charity in attendance is immediately to give information of\r\nthe same to the medical man appointed to the district.\r\n\r\n(2.) For this purpose she obtains the _form of notification_ for\r\nconducting the inspection of the dead, which contains the divisions of\r\nthe districts of inspection, and the names of the physicians appointed\r\nto each district.\r\n\r\n(3.) In order that the physician may inspect _immediately, and without\r\nthe slightest delay_, the case of death in his district, the name of the\r\nstreet, the number and floor of the house in which the death occurs is\r\nto be given with exactness, so that he may not in any way be hindered in\r\ngoing to the place and making the earliest possible inspection.\r\n\r\n(4.) Before this inspection has taken place, it is expressly forbidden\r\nto undress the corpse, or wash it, or, if the death is a natural one, to\r\nremove it from the bed or room in which the death took place, or even to\r\ntake away or alter the position of the pillow.\r\n\r\n(5.) Any disobedience to this law will be punished by a fine of from 5\r\nto 15 florins, or by a three days’ imprisonment.\r\n\r\n(6.) The physician will make a note of all the circumstances of the\r\nfirst inspection, according to his instructions. If he should consider\r\nthat particular arrangements are necessary, they are to be adopted\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n(7.) His note of remarks shall be left at the house, in the charge of\r\nthe soul-nun, and through them the signature of the physicians attending\r\nthe person who had died, if such there has been, shall be procured.\r\n\r\n(8.) If the dead is retained at the house till the time of interment,\r\nthe note of inspection must be directly handed over to the public\r\nsurgeon, in order that he may make the second inspection, and determine\r\nfurther what is necessary with regard to the interment.\r\n\r\n(9.) If after a certain length of time he sees no reason to postpone the\r\ninterment, he will make a note to that effect and give it to the police\r\ndirection, and from them is procured the sanction for the interment.\r\n\r\nThis sanction will be given in to the clergyman’s office belonging to\r\nthe district, and thence handed over to the officer who has the care of\r\nthe house for the reception of the dead previous to interment. Without\r\nthis sanction no corpse can be interred.\r\n\r\n(10.) The corpse must be retained until interment in an apartment where\r\nthere is fresh and pure air. The coffin must not be closed, nor the face\r\ncovered till after the second inspection, and the hands and feet must\r\nnot be bound.\r\n\r\nIf any signs of life should be observed, the district physician is\r\nimmediately to be called.\r\n\r\n(11.) If the corpse is conveyed into the house for the reception of the\r\ndead, the second inspection must be made there. The district physician’s\r\nnote of inspection is to be given to the officer of the house for the\r\nreception of the dead at the time, or before the corpse being brought\r\nthere, and that officer is to hand over the note to the public surgeon.\r\nWithout this note of inspection, no corpse can be received into the\r\nhouse for the reception of the dead.\r\n\r\n(12.) The soul-nuns, or midwives, or whoever is intrusted with this\r\noffice, must wait for the second inspection, and for the time when the\r\npublic surgeon shall pronounce that the interment is necessary. For this\r\npurpose the surgeon will make the requisite certificate, which must then\r\nbe given to the proper officer, who immediately gives the sanction for\r\nthe interment.\r\n\r\n(13.) As the second inspection in the house for the reception of the\r\ndead must take place, according to the regulations, in the morning\r\nbetween 9 and 10, and in the afternoon between 3 and 4, the sanction for\r\ninterment may be procured between 11 and 12 in the morning, and 4 and 5\r\nin the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 3.\r\n  DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE VERIFICATION OF THE CAUSES OF DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _Thomas Abraham_, Esq., Surgeon.\r\n\r\nYou are Registrar of Deaths in the City of London Union. Since you have\r\nbeen Registrar, have you had occasion to send notice to the coroner of\r\ncases where the causes of death stated appeared suspicious?—Yes, in\r\nabout half-a-dozen cases. One was of an old gentleman occupying\r\napartments in Bell Alley. His servant went out to market, and on her\r\nreturn, in less than an hour, found him dead on the bed, with his legs\r\nlying over the side of it. He had been ailing some time, and was seized\r\noccasionally with difficulty of breathing, but able to get up, and when\r\nshe left him she did not perceive anything unusual in his appearance. I\r\nwent to the house myself, and made inquiries into the cause of death;\r\nand although I did not discover anything to lead to the suspicion of his\r\nhaving died from poison or other unfair means, I considered it involved\r\nin obscurity, and referred the case to the coroner for investigation.\r\nAnother case was of a traveller who was found dead in his bed at an inn.\r\nThe body was removed to a distance of forty miles before a certificate\r\nto authorize the burial was applied for. His usual medical attendant\r\ncertified to his having been for several years the subject of aortic\r\naneurism, which was the probable cause of his sudden death, although the\r\nevidence was imperfect and unsatisfactory, and could not be otherwise\r\nwithout an examination of the body, and I therefore refused to register\r\nit without notice to the coroner.\r\n\r\nA third case occurred a few days ago. A medical certificate was\r\npresented to me of the death of a man from disease of the heart and\r\naneurism of the aorta. He was driven in a cab to the door of a medical\r\npractitioner in this neighbourhood, and was found dead. He might have\r\ndied from poison, and, without the questions put on the occasion of\r\nregistering the cause of death, the case might have passed without\r\nnotice. There was not in this case, as in others, any evidence to show\r\nthat death was occasioned by unfair means, but the causes were obscure\r\nand unsatisfactory, and I felt it to be my duty to have them\r\ninvestigated by the coroner.\r\n\r\nBut for anything known, you may have passed cases of murder?—Certainly;\r\nand there is at present no security against such cases. The personal\r\ninspection of the deceased would undoubtedly act as a great security.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your practice, have you had occasion to believe that\r\nevil is produced by the retention of the corpse?—Yes; I can give an\r\ninstance of a man, his wife, and six children, living in one room, in\r\nDraper’s Buildings. The mother and all the children successively fell\r\nill of typhus fever: the mother died; the body remained in the room. I\r\nwished it to be removed the next day, and I also wished the children to\r\nbe removed, being afraid that the fever would extend. The children were\r\napparently well at the time of the death of the mother. The\r\nrecommendation was not attended to: the body was kept five days in the\r\nonly room which this family of eight had to live and sleep in. The\r\neldest daughter was attacked about a week after the mother had been\r\nremoved, and, after three days’ illness, that daughter died. The corpse\r\nof this child was only kept three days, as we determined that it should\r\npositively be removed. In about nine days after the death of the girl,\r\nthe youngest child was attacked, and it died in about nine days. Then\r\nthe second one was taken: he lay twenty-three days, and died. Then\r\nanother boy died. The two other children recovered.\r\n\r\nBy the immediate removal of the corpse, and the use of proper preventive\r\nmeans, how many deaths do you believe might have been prevented?—I think\r\nit probable that the one took it from the other, and that if the corpse\r\nof the first had been removed the rest would have escaped; although I,\r\nof course, admit that the same cause which produced the disease of the\r\nmother might also have produced it in the children. I believe that, in\r\ncases of typhus, scarlatina, and other infectious diseases, it\r\nfrequently happens that the living are attacked by the same disease from\r\nthe retention of the body.\r\n\r\nHave you had occasion to observe the effects of cesspools in your\r\ndistrict?—Yes, and that they are very injurious to the health. In the\r\nstates of the weather when offensive emanations arise from the cesspools\r\nand drains, I have often heard people complain of headache, giddiness,\r\nnausea, languor, and an indisposition for exertion of any kind; and I\r\nhave known a walk or a ride in the open air to remove those symptoms,\r\nbut in an hour or two after their return home they have found themselves\r\nas bad as before. Their sleep brings them little or no refreshment; in\r\ntruth, they have inhaled, during the whole of the night, the noxious\r\natmosphere, which is very depressing, and will fully account for their\r\nrising, as they often say, as tired as when they went to bed. As an\r\nexample, I may mention the case of a compositor, residing in Draper’s\r\nBuildings—a narrow, confined, and filthy place, where there was always a\r\ndisgusting stench in every house. He was the subject of disordered\r\nstomach and liver, which might have been induced by his night-work and\r\nintemperance: the stinking hole in which he resided contributed its\r\nshare towards it, without doubt. This man remained at home for a week,\r\nwhen he was getting better, but had scarcely any appetite. I advised him\r\nto walk in Finsbury Circus two or three times a-day, as long as he could\r\nwithout fatigue; and on several occasions, when he returned to his\r\ndinner, he said, “Now, if I had had my dinner in Finsbury Circus I could\r\nhave eaten a hearty one, but now I do not seem to care anything about\r\nit.” I believe that if I had entered that man’s house with a good\r\nappetite for a dinner, and had remained there for an hour, that I should\r\nhave cared no more about eating than he did,—which I attribute to the\r\nnauseating and depressing effects of the effluvia from the cesspools,\r\ndrains, and general filthiness of the place.\r\n\r\nAre you aware whether this state of things arose from the cesspools or\r\nthe state of the sewers?—I conceive the worst have been cesspools; but\r\nthe drains, if they open, are just as bad. I was called upon to visit a\r\npatient living in a court in Whitecross Street, ill of typhus fever; in\r\nthe centre of it was a gully-hole, which was untrapped and smelt\r\nhorribly. The fever went through the whole of that court. I gave it as\r\nmy opinion at the time, that the case I visited was occasioned by the\r\ngully-hole, and that the fever would go through the court, which it did.\r\n\r\nHave you perceived the present state of the drains in the city of\r\nLondon?—At times they smell very strongly, which scarcely any one can\r\nfail to notice; but I have heard country-people complain of them at\r\ntimes when they have not attracted any particular notice from me.\r\n\r\nAre you aware that decomposing matter is allowed to accumulate in\r\nthem?—Yes; very recently they took up the refuse in our street, Old\r\nBroad Street; it smelt very badly, and it was black and horribly filthy.\r\n\r\nHow long before had the sewer been cleansed?—I do not know. I do not\r\nremember its having been cleansed, before the last September, since I\r\nhave been there, which is about nine years.\r\n\r\nDo you remember to have perceived the smell from the sewers before the\r\nlast September?—Yes; there is a gully-hole near my own house from which\r\nthere was constantly an offensive smell: it was much worse after a thaw\r\nin winter, or a shower of rain in summer. A neighbour living two doors\r\nfrom me being more annoyed by it than I, made great efforts, and at\r\nlength succeeded in getting it trapped; and I have not since perceived\r\nany smell from it, though I observe it now in other places. The\r\ngully-holes are trapped now in most of the respectable streets, but in\r\nthe bye and poor streets they are not trapped.\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence which has come before you, have you any doubt that the\r\nexisting state of sewers in the City are the latent cause of much\r\ndisease and death?—I have not the least doubt of it in the world.—A\r\ngreat deal of active disease, which creeps on gradually and insidiously,\r\nmay be traced to that cause.\r\n\r\nIn the poorer districts, in what state is the surface-cleansing of the\r\nstreets?—Even the best streets are very badly cleansed, but in the\r\npoorer streets of the city the cleansing is very bad indeed—horribly\r\nbad! Take Duke’s Place, for example; you will see cabbage-stalks and\r\nrotten oranges that have been thrown away, and they often remain there\r\nfor several days. We do not get our streets swept oftener than once\r\na-week.\r\n\r\nIf there were a perfect system of drainage and cleansing in the city, do\r\nyou think that the health and the duration of life of the inhabitants\r\nwould be extended?—I think there would be a considerable extension.\r\n\r\nWhat is the physical condition of the children born in London of parents\r\nwho are natives of the rural districts, as compared with the physical\r\ncondition of children who are born in the country of parents of the same\r\nclass?—The children born and bred up in London are more frequently of\r\nsmall stature and have slender limbs, are deficient in stamina and\r\npowers of endurance, are of irritable frames and prone to inflammatory\r\nattack, than children born and bred up in the country. An impure\r\natmosphere is immeasurably more injurious to children than adults.\r\nChildren also suffer more from want of opportunities of exercise in the\r\nopen air. The beneficial effects of pure air and exercise on children\r\nwho have been born and pent up in London are most marked: a weakly\r\nchild, and which, if kept in London, would perhaps always continue\r\nweakly, would most likely become strong and healthy if sent into the\r\ncountry. I cannot doubt that children born of healthy parents, and bred\r\nup in the country, would be more robust and stronger than children born\r\nof the same class of parents and bred up in London, and that this\r\ndifference may be justly ascribable to atmospheric influence.\r\n\r\nWhen children are weakly, what is the effect on the temper and\r\ncharacter?—The temper and character of weakly children are generally\r\nfound to correspond with, and are most probably derived from, the\r\ncharacter of their constitution: their temper is quick and irritable,\r\ntheir passions ardent, their perception keen, and their imagination\r\npredominant over their judgment.\r\n\r\nYou are speaking, of course, of the general characteristics of\r\nindividuals as specimens of the population brought up under such\r\ncircumstances?—Yes, of persons coming under my own observation.\r\n\r\nHave you, as Registrar of Deaths, noticed the larger proportion of\r\ninfant mortality in the city?—There is, I conceive, all over the\r\nkingdom, a large proportion of infant deaths; but I have no doubt that a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the excess of infant deaths in London is\r\nascribable to atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the Mortuary Registration, that of deaths in the city\r\nof London, about one-half are deaths of children under ten years of age;\r\nwhilst in a rural district, take the county of Hereford for example,\r\nonly one-third of the deaths are deaths of children.\r\n\r\nDo you conceive it probable that this different rate of infant mortality\r\nis to be traced chiefly to the difference of the atmospheric influence,\r\nthe average age of all of the labouring classes being, in Herefordshire,\r\n39 years, whilst in the City of London the average age of the deaths of\r\nall the labouring classes is only 22 years?—I am decidedly of opinion\r\nthat a greater proportion of the excess of infant mortality in London,\r\nand the reduced duration of life, are ascribable to atmospheric\r\nimpurity.\r\n\r\nIf all cesspools were removed, and water-closets substituted; if water\r\nwere introduced into the houses of the poorest classes; if the sewers\r\nwere regularly flushed weekly, or oftener, so as to prevent\r\naccumulations of deposit and the escape of miasma, such as you have\r\ndescribed; if the carriage and foot pavements were more frequently and\r\ncompletely cleansed; if these several public duties were performed with\r\npracticable efficiency, can you express a confident opinion that\r\ndecrease and premature deaths would be considerably diminished?—I am\r\nquite confident that the adoption of such measures would not only\r\ndiminish disease of every kind, but greatly improve the moral as well as\r\nthe physical condition of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 4.\r\n THE PROPORTIONS OF DEATHS AND FUNERALS PREVENTIBLE BY SANITARY MEANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Henry Blenkarne_, Esq., South West District Surgeon of the City of\r\n                             London Union.\r\n\r\nHave you in your district perceived any effects resulting from\r\ninterments in the parochial burying places?—I have no cognizance of any\r\nbad effects resulting from those interments. The first twenty years of\r\nmy life I lived close to a burial-ground, and never was aware or heard\r\nof any prejudicial consequences arising. I may observe, however, that\r\nwhen a relation of mine has attended the church she has been enabled to\r\nperceive whenever a vault underneath the church has been opened. She has\r\nsaid, “I feel they have opened a vault;” and on inquiry it has turned\r\nout to have been so.\r\n\r\nHave you observed any evil effects following the practice of the long\r\nretention of the corpse in the house amidst the living?—Yes, I have\r\nobserved effects follow, but I cannot say produced by them, though they\r\nwere perhaps increased by them. In those cases which I have had where\r\nthere has been a succession of cases of fever in the same family, after\r\na death it has generally occurred that the parties affected have\r\ncomplained two or three days before that they felt very unwell.\r\nGenerally this has been the case. I have, in such instances, ordered\r\nthem medicine immediately. Since the Union has been established we have\r\nimmediately removed all fever cases to the Fever Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe retention of the corpse amidst the living, under such circumstances,\r\nmust aggravate the mortality, must it not?—There cannot be a moment’s\r\ndoubt about it.\r\n\r\nWhat, from the observations in your district, has been the actual state\r\nof the sewerage, and cleansing dependent upon it, as the cleansing of\r\nthe cesspools?—There has been great improvement in the city of London by\r\nthe improvement of the sewerage, in so far as it has removed the\r\ncesspools. When you went into a respectable house formerly, you could,\r\nin the city, tell the state of the weather by the smell from the\r\ncesspools. Where water-closets are substituted, the health of the\r\ninhabitants has undoubtedly been improved. In the poorer neighbourhoods,\r\nwhere they have still cesspools, they are still very bad. I constantly\r\ntell them, if you get rid of that nasty cesspool you’ll get well and\r\nkeep well; it is of no use my giving you physic until that is done.\r\nWhere there have been deposits accumulating in the sewers, and the\r\ndrains have been choked up, the effect has been just the same as if\r\nthere had been cesspools.\r\n\r\nYou are aware that in respect to sewerage it is the practice to allow\r\ndeposits to accumulate in the sewers, and then, when the private drains\r\nare stopped up, to open the sewer and get out the deposit by means of\r\nbuckets, and remove it in carts?—Yes, I am.\r\n\r\nHave you seen any illness result from this practice?—I cannot state a\r\ncase, though I have no doubt of its highly injurious effects; but can\r\ndecidedly speak to illness arising from the accumulations. The illness\r\nis just the same as from cesspools: a low depressing nervous fever, most\r\nlike that which is described to be the form of the jungle fever. In\r\nNovember or December last, they were taking up the deposits from the\r\nsewers near Broken Wharf, in Upper Thames-street: the stench from it was\r\nquite sufficient to have produced any fever: it was not within my\r\ndistrict, and I do not know what were the effects. Fortunately there was\r\nclear weather, and the wind blew towards the river.\r\n\r\nHave you any doubt that the removal of such refuse, as well as the\r\naccumulation, must be attended with danger to life?—Yes; if any person\r\nin a state of mental or bodily depression were exposed to such an\r\ninfluence, it would produce low fever; it would be dangerous in\r\nproportion as it was stagnant.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the city, have you been assailed with smells from\r\ngully-holes?—Only yesterday, in passing through the city, the smells\r\nfrom many of the gully-holes were very offensive; and several medical\r\nfriends agree with me in attributing extremely prejudicial consequences\r\nas arising from this cause.\r\n\r\nThe following case is related on the authority of Dr. Good, as having\r\noccurred within the city of London, and is mentioned by Mr. Fuller, in a\r\nletter from a surgeon who has paid great attention to the influence of\r\nsewerage, and who adduces the facts of the case in evidence that typhus\r\nmay be produced by the miasma from sewers:—“Soon after the closing of\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee, I learned, from the late Dr. Hope, the\r\nparticulars of a case which, to my mind, has completely proved the\r\nproduction of typhus fever from it, and was so much in the character of\r\nan _experimentum crucis_, that I did not consider it necessary to\r\nprosecute the inquiry any further. The case is as follows:—“A family in\r\nthe city of London, who had occupied the same house for many years,\r\nenjoying a good state of health, had a nursery-maid seized with typhus\r\nfever; the young woman was removed from the house and another\r\nsubstituted in her place. In a short time the new nurse-maid was\r\nattacked with typhus fever, and was also sent away. A few weeks after\r\none of the children was seized with the same fever: an inquiry was now\r\ninstituted by the medical man in attendance, in order to ascertain, if\r\npossible, the cause of this frequent recurrence of typhus fever, when\r\nthe following facts were brought to light:—The nursery was situated on\r\nthe upper floor but one of the house, and about a fortnight or three\r\nweeks before the first case of fever occurred, a sink was placed in the\r\ncorner of the nursery for the purpose of saving the labour of the\r\nservants; this was found to communicate with the common sewer, and to be\r\nquite open, or untrapped; they ordered it immediately to be effectually\r\ntrapped, and then no other case of fever occurred, although it continued\r\nto be occupied as before; and, when I learned the case, more than a\r\ntwelvemonth had passed.””\r\n\r\nHave you met with cases analogous to the one here stated?—I have met\r\nwith several such cases. I know of an instance where a room in an old\r\nhouse had an offensive stench, and the health of the person living in it\r\nwas always bad. A stench was perceived in the room, which it was guessed\r\nmight arise from the decay of dead rats in the wainscot. The party went\r\nto much expense to pull down the wainscot, when it was found that there\r\nwas an opening which communicated with the cesspool below. The hole was\r\nproperly cemented and stopped up, and the room has since that time\r\nbecome quite habitable and healthy; and where I have directed the\r\ncesspools to be emptied, as the predisposing cause, the general result\r\nhas been that the sick have immediately got well. From my knowledge of\r\nthe local causes I can predicate, with certainty, what will be the\r\ngeneral effect on the health in the case of removal of the parties.\r\n\r\nBesides the houses of the labouring classes, are there many houses of\r\nthe middling classes in your district in the city of London that are\r\nprovided with cesspools?—Many houses that I go into are provided with\r\ncesspools. I mentioned the other day to a lady that I should never be\r\nenabled to keep her well so long as there was a cesspool in the house; I\r\ntold her that the expense of continued medical attendance would pay for\r\na communication with the common sewer and better cleansing.\r\n\r\nAre you aware that a new practice has arisen of preventing the\r\naccumulation of deposits in the sewers, by flushes of water, which\r\nremove all deposits weekly, and so far prevent the year’s accumulation\r\nand corruption of deposits in the sewers. If this system were enforced\r\nin the city, have you any doubt as to the extensive prevention of\r\ndisease and mortality which would be thereby effected amongst all\r\nclasses?—Certainly it would be a great boon, in a sanitary point of\r\nview, to the population of the city of London. I am so much convinced of\r\nthis, that in my own house I put a stick under the handle of the\r\nwater-closet, so as to have a continued flow or flush of water for some\r\nlength of time; this I do to remove any accidental accumulation. Of\r\ncourse the flushing of the common sewers would have the same effects.\r\n\r\nBesides the accumulations in the sewers, is there at this time no\r\ndecomposing refuse from the defective cleansing of the courts and\r\nbye-streets, and poorer districts?—Yes; in the poorer districts there is\r\naccumulation. In one court, for example, called Harrow-court,\r\nThames-street, where there is almost always low fever, there is always\r\ndirt and filth, and I am constantly exhorting the people to remove the\r\nfilth; but the great difficulty with the poor people is commonly how to\r\nget the water. There is a court in Cornhill which a man was cleansing\r\nthe other day by applying a hose to the water-cock (which is used in\r\ncase of fire), in order to cleanse the pavement. An officer belonging to\r\nthe water company coming by, said, “If I see you doing that again, I\r\nshall indict you.”\r\n\r\nAre you aware that the streets are swept oftener than weekly in the city\r\nof London?—My impression is—not oftener.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed that water should be laid on, and kept at high\r\npressure in the streets, so as to enable the courts and alleys, the foot\r\nand the carriage pavements, to be washed daily by means of a hose\r\nattached to the water-pipes. This, which has been proposed for\r\nprotection against fire, as well as for cleansing the streets more\r\ncompletely, has, I am informed, been done in Philadelphia. If the system\r\nwere carried out in the city of London, what do you conceive would be\r\nthe effect on the health of the population in the poorer districts?—I\r\nshould certainly say that it would tend greatly to prolong life amongst\r\nthe population.\r\n\r\nFrom the mortuary registries it appears that the average duration of\r\nlife among the professional persons and gentry in the city of London,\r\nwho live in better cleansed and ventilated houses, and better cleansed\r\nstreets, is, on the average of the whole class, about 43 years, and 6\r\nper cent. of the deaths are deaths from epidemic disease; whilst among\r\nthe labouring classes the proportion of deaths from epidemic disease is\r\n19 per cent., and the average age of all who die is only 22 years. With\r\nsuch sanitary regulations as are under the public control of the public\r\nauthorities, to what extent do you think it probable the duration of\r\nlife amongst the labouring classes may be extended?—So far as I can\r\njudge, without examination of the particular cases, I should say that\r\nthe average might be extended one-half at the least.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the cases of epidemic diseases may decidedly be ascribed\r\nto the want of cleanliness and ventilation. On looking over the mortuary\r\nregistry of the deaths occurring in Upper Thames-street and the district\r\nattached to it, I find the causes of death most frequently registered\r\nare “low fever,” “low fever,” occurring one after the other. This\r\nrecurrence of low fever corresponds with my experience of sickness,\r\nwhich so often assumes the character of low typhoid nervous depression.\r\nThe medicine I use in the greatest quantity is ammonia, as an active\r\ndiffusive stimulus. For all classes this medicine is in constant use. In\r\ndamp weather we have always much increase of this illness: the dampness\r\nproduces a depression which lays them open to the atmospheric poison.\r\n\r\nHave you had instances where better cleansing has taken place and\r\nillness diminished?—Yes; for example, in Ireland-yard, containing a\r\nlarge number of families of coal-heavers and others, a place which I\r\nnever was out of from continued illnesses: the yard has been much better\r\ncleansed, the houses put in better order, and now there is very little\r\nillness there. I know for a fact, that in the neighbourhood of\r\nLondon-wall, where recently great improvements have taken place in the\r\nsewerage and ventilation, disease has greatly diminished, especially\r\n_low fever_. Formerly they had a sewer which used to be stopped up and\r\noverflowed; they have had of late a new sewer, which now works better;\r\nthey have no stink or stench in the kitchens, as formerly, and they have\r\nnothing of the same kind of disease going on there that they used to\r\nhave before.\r\n\r\nAre the houses in Ireland-yard occupied by the same inhabitants?—Just by\r\nthe same class. The habits of coal-heavers are reputed to be none of the\r\nbest in respect to general cleanliness or temperance.\r\n\r\nHave you observed any alteration in their habits?—Not in the least.\r\n\r\nHave you observed what is the personal condition of the natives of\r\nLondon?—The real cockney is generally of stunted growth.\r\n\r\nHave you observed whether the children born in London of parents who\r\nhave come from the rural districts are as tall or as strong as the\r\nparents?—Generally shorter children, though some of them are as tall,\r\nbut all are of comparatively weakly constitutions; they are particularly\r\npredisposed to strumous disease. I have been so impressed with the\r\neffect of children living in a London atmosphere, that I have been\r\nanxious to send them out of it when possible.\r\n\r\nDoes not defective cleansing, as causing atmospheric impurity, not only\r\ntend to produce disease and shorten the duration of life, but depress\r\nthe physical condition of the population?—Decidedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Dr. Wray_, Medical Officer of the West London Union.\r\n\r\nYou have read what is stated by Mr. Blencarne, and by Mr. Abrahams—do\r\nyou generally agree with them as to the effects of defective cleansing,\r\non the condition of the population?—I agree with the whole of what they\r\nstate; it perfectly accords with my own experience, which has been about\r\n25 years in this district. I have during that time observed a great\r\nfalling off in the condition of the children; they are stunted, squalid,\r\npoor-looking things, and there is a great deal of deformity amongst\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHave you observed moral effects attendant on the physical\r\ndepression?—Yes; I have observed a great deal in our neighbourhood. I\r\nthink the females of the poorer classes who are not strong for work, are\r\nmore apt to take to courses of livelihood other than by work;—that very\r\nmany of them go upon the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Thomas Porter_, Surgeon to the St. Botolph’s Bishopsgate District.\r\n\r\nHave you observed any emanations from the sewers in your district?—In\r\nLiverpool-street there is now a cleansing of the sewers by opening the\r\ntop, taking the soil out, and carting it away.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of this process?—It vitiates the atmosphere to a\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nHave you observed any effects from it?—I have often found headache to\r\nresult from it to myself, and parties have complained to me of the same\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nWhat is the state of the drainage?—There are some districts, such as\r\nHalfmoon-street, which are imperfectly drained, where the cesspools are\r\nsuffered to overflow and run along the kennels at the sides\r\nof the street, causing fœtid and deleterious exhalations;\r\nin this street and the alleys opening into it, especially\r\nThompson’s-court, Thompson’-rents, Baker’s-court, Providence-place, and\r\nCampions-buildings, fever prevails nearly the whole year round. It also\r\nprevails very much in Bligh’s-buildings, Lamb-alley, Dunning’s-alley,\r\nSweet Apple-court, Montague-court, Artillery-lane, Rose-alley, and\r\nCatherine-wheel-alley. These places, all of which are badly drained and\r\nnot regularly cleansed, are seldom without fever for any length of time.\r\n\r\nIn these places are there any water-closets?—No; they have nothing but\r\ncommon necessaries, which are usually allowed to run over before they\r\nare emptied, and it is impossible to enter the tenements without being\r\nassailed by the disagreeable and unhealthy effluvia thence arising.\r\n\r\nHave they water laid on in the rooms of the several tenements?—Seldom in\r\nthe rooms; generally in some place in the court to which they all go.\r\nMany have not that even, and they resort to the common street pumps. I\r\ndo not remember an instance where water is properly laid on in any house\r\nof the labouring classes.\r\n\r\nWhat rents are paid for houses in this condition?—Rent for one room is\r\nfrom 1_s._ 6_d._ to 4_s._ 6_d._ per week. The rents are very high in\r\nproportion to the size and accommodation of the rooms.\r\n\r\nYou say you have observed emanations from the sewers within your\r\ndistrict?—Yes; they are frequently very offensive in moist warm weather.\r\nYou may, indeed, almost tell the condition of the weather from the\r\nsmells from the public sewers. Recently in returning from Islington\r\nalong the City-road from the Canal bridge to Finsbury-square, and along\r\nSun-street, I noticed in passing near the gratings, as every person must\r\nhave noticed, a peculiarly offensive effluvium.\r\n\r\nWithin the city itself have you perceived the same effluvium on passing\r\nthe gratings of the sewers?—Frequently; it is so general that no\r\nparticular place is distinguished by being free from it.\r\n\r\nSuppose a tradesman or a merchant returning from Change in a state of\r\ndepression from anxiety passing through a street, exposed to a\r\nsuccession of smells and breathing the effluvium from such sewers; what\r\nis likely to be the effect upon him?—A low nervous fever, with\r\nconsiderable gastric derangement. The greater part of fever cases which\r\nI have to treat are of this description.\r\n\r\nIs that with every class of persons?—Yes, with every rank of life. They\r\nare mostly of the low or typhoid type, and do not bear depletion. In my\r\nordinary course of treatment I generally begin by emptying the stomach\r\nand bowels, and by lowering the diet. I then use a moderately\r\nstimulating treatment with a perfect absence of solid food.\r\n\r\nIs gross feeding or excess very common amongst the people of your\r\ndistrict?—Not very common. Excess from drinking is more frequent than\r\nexcess from eating.\r\n\r\nIn what proportion will there be of excess from eating or drinking in\r\nsuch cases?—Amongst the labouring classes perhaps there may be one case\r\nin ten from excess of drinking, and one case in thirty from excess of\r\neating.\r\n\r\nIf these excesses had taken place in a purer atmosphere, do you conceive\r\nthe results in disease would have followed?—In most instances the system\r\nin a pure atmosphere would have thrown off the inconvenience without\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nThen excess or depression both predispose to the attacks of disease from\r\natmospheric impurity, and especially to the direct influence of the\r\neffluvium in question?—Yes, certainly; excess of watching, want of rest,\r\nmental anxiety, every depressing cause predisposes to an attack.\r\n\r\nBesides the defects in respect to the cleansing of the cesspools and the\r\ndrains, are there not defects in respect to other portions of cleansing,\r\nsuch as dust-bins neglected?—Yes, in those places there is no person to\r\nregulate or to see that done which ought to be done; consequently the\r\ndustmen and scavengers duty is much neglected, and places are filled\r\nwith decomposing remains, which remain there two or three weeks in\r\nsummer and much longer in winter. The carelessness of the people\r\nthemselves as to cleanliness is also deplorable, as it operates very\r\ninjuriously on their health and comfort; the floors of their rooms, the\r\npassages, stairs, and landings are often suffered to remain unwashed for\r\nweeks and months, and the walls and ceilings are seldom cleansed or\r\nwhitened, so that what with filthiness of one kind or other they present\r\nan appearance of wretchedness beyond all description.\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of the children born or kept in courts or places\r\nof the condition you describe, with badly cleansed drains, with privies,\r\nand without water or conveniences for cleansing introduced into their\r\nhabitations?—The children are, for the most part, of delicate or weak\r\nframe, and subject to struma. The health of children depends partly\r\nwhether they were born in such places or not, whether their parents on\r\neach side are Londoners, as there appears to be a gradual decline in\r\nphysical power by a long continuance in a vitiated atmosphere, which\r\npasses from parent to progeny, and partly also in a family where one\r\npart of the children have been born and brought up in the country and\r\nthe other in town; those born in the country, and not coming into London\r\nuntil they are five years of age, will have comparatively strong frames,\r\nand will resist such influences, whilst those born in town will be\r\ncomparatively of delicate frame, weakly and strumous, liable to\r\nglandular disease, and diseased affections of the joints and the spine.\r\nGenerally they are shorter in stature, sometimes they are taller, but\r\nthen they are slender and very delicate, in which case they are likely\r\nto have bending of the limbs.\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of females born under such circumstances?—I have\r\nobserved that the females are less depressed than the males, and are\r\nreared with less difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhy is this so?—I have not been able to determine. It may be that the\r\nmale requires more extensive and powerful exercise, and that in pure\r\nair, than the female, and consequently that the female suffers less from\r\nthe want of it.\r\n\r\nWhat are the moral characteristics of the population brought up under\r\nthese depressing physical circumstances?—They have decided unwillingness\r\nto labour. They are not so strenuous as the more healthy people from the\r\ncountry. They are more apt to resort to subterfuge to gain their ends\r\nwithout labour. Light employments they do not object to, and do\r\ncomparatively well in. But it is difficult to keep a native of London,\r\neither male or female to heavy work; they will avoid it if they can. The\r\ncause is in most cases physical from the deficiency of ability to\r\nlabour. The greatest part of them are mentally irritable and impatient\r\nunder moral restraint.\r\n\r\nIs any similar difference marked on the condition of the children of\r\ntradespeople between those children of tradespeople brought up in London\r\nand those born in the country?—Yes, there is a similar difference\r\nperceptible, but less in degree. Amongst tradesmen, too, it is the\r\nextensive practice of the parents to send their children out of town to\r\nschool or on visits, which may powerfully affect them beneficially. In\r\nthe tradesman’s family they have better sleeping rooms, and greater\r\ncleanliness in person, and in bed and body linen, and also a better\r\nregulated dietary.\r\n\r\nWhat is the effect of such atmospheric impurities as those described in\r\nthe chances of recovery from attacks of disease?—It lessens the chances\r\nof recovery and greatly impedes convalescence. Indeed, in many\r\ninstances, very little progress can be made until the patient is sent\r\nout into the country. In a case of fever which occurred to a strong\r\nhealthy man, aged 24, a carman, in a close neighbourhood, the house\r\nbeing without drains and ill ventilated; no progress could be effected\r\nuntil he was removed into the country, although the fever had decidedly\r\nsubsided. I believe that in this case something else would have\r\nsupervened, had he not been removed. I frequently remove patients in a\r\nrespectable condition, finding no chance of recovery without it. Many of\r\nthe better conditioned houses being badly adapted for the treatment of\r\nfevers, having low ceilings and insufficient ventilation.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the difference in respect to the time of cure or\r\nconvalescence between a well and an ill-cleansed neighbourhood?—A\r\ndifference of perhaps one-half.\r\n\r\nSuppose the rooms of each house supplied with water, the privies and\r\ncesspools removed, drains from the houses to sewers, and the sewers so\r\nconstructed as to be cleansed, and to convey away daily such refuse as\r\nthat which is allowed to remain decomposing in the close courts during\r\nweeks. Supposing the surfaces of the streets cleansed as frequently\r\nafter the manner in use in Philadelphia and other towns where they are\r\ncleansed with water daily, to what extent do you conceive disease would\r\nbe reduced?—Of fevers two-thirds certainly, and other diseases would be\r\nconsiderably lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _Mr. John H. Paul_, Surgeon, Medical Officer of the City of London\r\n                                 Union.\r\n\r\nIn what condition in respect to cleanliness are the courts and other\r\nplaces within your district, chiefly inhabited by the labouring\r\nclasses?—The cleansing of the courts and alleys in my district is\r\ndefective. I agree with what Mr. Blenkarne says in respect to cesspools.\r\nFor instance, in one room in a house in Sugar Loaf-court, Garlick-hill,\r\nnext to their common cesspool, I have frequently attended patients, and\r\nbefore going, I surmise that whatever disease they are primarily\r\naffected with, it will generally run into one of low character with\r\ntendency to typhus. In the interval of little more than a twelvemonth, I\r\nhave attended several occupants of the house, one after the other, who\r\nhave all been, to a certain extent, similarly affected. I have generally\r\nimproved their health by giving diffusive stimuli, and have occasionally\r\nprevailed on them to remove.\r\n\r\nHow many visits in the year may you have paid to this same\r\nhouse?—Upwards of forty visits. But there are other houses where there\r\nare similar evils, where I have had occasion to visit them still more\r\nfrequently. In one house in Star-court, Bread Street-hill, which is\r\nsimilarly situated, where almost the whole of the inmates were laid up\r\nwith fever, and where I had to visit it three times a day for upwards of\r\nthree weeks. There were deaths on each floor of that house. Fever\r\nassumed, at one time, so malignant an aspect, that there appeared to be\r\nno possibility of saving them, except by removal. I do not remember one\r\ncase of a removal in time where death ensued. The ward inquest had the\r\ninhabitants removed, and the house cleansed.\r\n\r\nBut was the cesspool removed?—Emptied but not removed.\r\n\r\nThen in time you will have a recurrence of the same evils in the place\r\nin question?—Yes, certainly.\r\n\r\nWhat is the condition of children brought up in such places?—Generally\r\npale and emaciated, scrofulous, and apt to mesenteric disease.\r\n\r\nYou were medical attendant at the Norwood school, where the pauper\r\nchildren from the city of London are taken. Do you think, that on a view\r\nof the children, and without any positive knowledge of the sort of\r\nresidences of the parents of the children, you could on the view select\r\nfrom the rest, the children who came from the courts and alleys, such as\r\nyou have described in the city of London?—I have but little doubt of it,\r\nthough generally speaking the children from the city were of rather a\r\nbetter description than those from more crowded localities. Indeed, the\r\ncourts and alleys of my district are superior to those in other quarters\r\nof the metropolis. They are situated near the banks of the Thames with a\r\nconsiderable fall towards the river. Some parents also take their\r\nchildren much out into the open air, and in these the influence of the\r\nplace would not be so visible, but with the majority there would be but\r\nvery little mistake. Whilst at Norwood, my chief trouble arose from this\r\nsick and diseased class of children, who generally improved very much\r\nafter being there some little time.\r\n\r\nWhat was the moral condition of these physically depressed children, as\r\ncompared with other pauper children, whose position had been less\r\nunfavourable?—The moral condition of this depressed class of children\r\nwas generally worse also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 8.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects observed of Dark, Ill-ventilated, and Ill-drained Localities on\r\n     the Moral and Physical Condition of the Population of Paris._\r\n\r\nDr. la Chaise, in his Medical Topography of Paris, which is an early\r\nattempt to investigate the influence of localities on the moral and\r\nphysical condition of a population, gives the following description of\r\nthe physical condition of the short-lived population bred up in the\r\nnarrow and dark streets, and ill-cleansed and badly ventilated houses of\r\nParis, which description may serve for comparison with those given of\r\nthe native population in the crowded and badly cleansed districts of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n“The Parisian,” he says, “in stature is often below what is commonly\r\ntermed middle-size. His fair skin, soft to the touch, forms a striking\r\ncontrast to that of the inhabitant of small towns, and, above all, to\r\nthe countryman, who is more exposed to the various changes of the\r\nweather, and to the action of the sun and light. The hair of the\r\nParisian is generally fair or light brown, and his eyes blue. His\r\nmuscular frame is little developed, so that the form has on the whole a\r\nfeminine appearance. In the labouring class the muscles of the lower\r\nlimbs are sometimes developed, but irregularly and incompletely, which\r\nis explained by the exercise given exclusively to certain muscles by\r\ntheir employment or handicraft; these irregularities of development are\r\nmuch less frequent in the rural districts where the movements, and\r\nconsequently muscular actions, are much more equally divided. The\r\ntemperament, that is to say the physical constitution peculiar to the\r\nParisian, differs, as is perceived, from each of the distinct and\r\ndetermined forms admitted by physiologists. He seems to partake of the\r\nunion of many,—to be intermediate between those which are recognized\r\nunder the names nervous, bilious, and lymphatic-sanguine; the first\r\nseems, however, to predominate.\r\n\r\n“It is not, however, rare to meet in Paris with physical constitutions\r\nentirely in the extremes and contrasted with each other; that is to say,\r\nthere are here, as in other large towns, large numbers of weakly and\r\ndebilitated, vulgarly called sickly, and others with hollow chest and\r\ntall slim figure.\r\n\r\n“The women of Paris are rather pretty than handsome; without regular\r\nfeatures, they owe to the development of the cellular tissue, and to the\r\nfairness and fineness of the skin, a certain softness of form which is\r\nvery graceful; and a quick and spiritual eye makes one forget the\r\npaleness of their cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Considered morally, the portrait of the Parisian presents colours which\r\nare not impossible to seize, notwithstanding their great variety. He may\r\nbe said generally to be lively, spiritual, industrious, and deserving\r\nthe name of frivolous. Much less perhaps is given him. He is\r\ninquisitive, and carries into his work a taste, an ardent imagination,\r\nand inventive mind, which he is willing to believe should compensate for\r\nsustained activity. There necessarily results from this a great nervous\r\nsusceptibility, an _encéphalique_ predominance, which it is important to\r\nthe physician never to overlook.\r\n\r\n“If a sound and firm organization allows a few to resist the effects of\r\nthis premature exercise of the organ of thought, a rapid increase in its\r\nfunctions always shows itself in the injury done to the other organs,\r\nand generally to the muscular system, which bear the marks of feebleness\r\nand often of deplorable languor. In this life, too active morally and\r\ntoo indolent physically, the nervous system acquires not what is\r\nvulgarly called a feebleness or delicacy, but a susceptibility, or\r\nrather a predominance, which is affected by the least shock. Hence that\r\nfickleness, and that vivacity of desires, that changeableness in the\r\ntastes, in a word that coquetry, that unequal and whimsical moody\r\ncharacter, those caprices and vapours. The character is not alone\r\naffected by this excess of susceptibility; all the organs, the whole of\r\nthe economy of the body feels it in turn; the nervous system acts\r\nparticularly on the uterus, developes it prematurely; thus the women\r\ngenerally arrive at puberty much earlier at Paris than in the provinces,\r\nand especially than in the country. It is not unfrequent to find young\r\ngirls of 12 or 13 fully formed and capable of becoming mothers, whilst\r\nin the country, even in the south, they do not attain that period till\r\nthe age of 15 or 16.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. 9.\r\n    NOTE TO PAGE 128, ON SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN’S PLAN FOR EXTRA MURAL\r\n INTERMENTS, AND FOR EXCLUDING GRAVEYARDS ON THE REBUILDING OF THE CITY\r\n                               OF LONDON.\r\n\r\nWhosoever examines the various modern plans for the improvement of the\r\nmetropolis, and compares them with the plan of the architect of St.\r\nPaul’s, will see in them only small approximations to his conceptions,\r\nand that they only provide for a few large openings, without reference\r\nto any general sanitary considerations, and without providing for the\r\nmass of the population, whereas he was for “excluding all narrow dark\r\nalleys without thoroughfares, and courts,” such as are commonly left\r\nuntouched in the new lines of streets; and he had provided that not only\r\n“all church yards,” but “all trades that use great fires, or yield\r\nnoisome smells, be placed out of town.” If, as is confidently maintained\r\non such evidence as that before referred to, _ante_ p. 22 and 25, the\r\nproportions of death might even now be reduced by one-third in the city\r\nof London by better drainage and other sanitary measures (independently\r\nof the removal of those courts and alleys, &c.), on the evidence of the\r\nproportions of mortality actually prevalent in districts such as he\r\nwould have constructed, facilitating, and almost necessitating by\r\nregular lines an early and more systematic drainage below the streets,\r\nas well as a free and copious flow of fresh air from above, it may be as\r\nconfidently maintained that the mortality and numbers of burials would\r\nhave been reduced in like proportions from the period of the rebuilding\r\nof the city. The whole of the deformed area stands as a monument of the\r\ndisasters incurred to the living generation, by a weak and careless\r\nyielding, not of the present to the future, but of the present itself,\r\nto blind and ignorant impulses, which have entailed immense\r\ndemoralization, waste of health, and life and money, and a large\r\nproportion of the evil which now depresses the sanitary condition of the\r\npopulation of that particular district which his improvements would have\r\ncovered. “The practicability of this whole scheme,” says the Parentalia,\r\n“without loss to any man or infringement of any property, was at that\r\ntime fully demonstrated, and all material objections fully weighed and\r\nanswered; the only, and as it happened, insurmountable difficulty, was\r\nthe obstinate averseness of a great part of the citizens to alter their\r\nold properties, and to recede from building their houses again on the\r\nold ground and foundations, as also the distrust in many, and\r\nunwillingness to give up their properties, though for a time only, into\r\nthe hands of public trustees or commissioners, till they might be\r\ndispensed to them again, with more advantages to themselves than\r\notherwise was possible to be effected; for such a method was proposed,\r\nthat by an equal distribution of ground into buildings, leaving out\r\nchurchyards, gardens, &c. (which are to be removed out of the town),\r\nthere would have been sufficient room both for the augmentation of the\r\nstreets, disposition of the churches, halls, and all public buildings,\r\nand to have given every proprietor full satisfaction; and although few\r\nproprietors should happen to have been seated again directly upon the\r\nvery same ground they had possessed before the fire, yet no man would\r\nhave been thrust any considerable distance from it, but been placed, at\r\nleast, as conveniently, and sometimes more so, to their own trades than\r\nbefore.” “By these means the opportunity, in a great degree, was lost of\r\nmaking the new city the most magnificent, as well as commodious, for\r\nhealth and trade of any upon earth, and the surveyor being thus confined\r\nand cramped in his designs, it required no small labour and skill to\r\nmodel the city in the manner it has since appeared.” The plan was\r\napproved by the King and the Parliament, but opposed by the corporation,\r\nwho, it is stated in a history of the city institutions, by one of its\r\nofficers, conceived that they would have lost population and trade by\r\nthe plan; _i. e._, they would have been spread beyond its jurisdiction.\r\nBut on both points this policy was dreadfully mistaken. Only a\r\nburthensome population is obtained by overcrowding, that is to say, a\r\nlarger than the natural proportions of the young and dependent, of\r\nwidowhood, and early and destitute orphanage, and of sickly and\r\ndependent, and prematurely aged adults. As an example of the coincidence\r\nof pecuniary economy with enlarged sanitary measures, it may be\r\nmentioned, that it is shown in a report on a survey made for sanitary\r\npurposes by Mr. Butler Williams of the College of Civil Engineers,\r\nPutney, that a loss of not less than 80,000_l._ per annum is now\r\nincurred in carriage traffic alone on two main lines of street, namely,\r\nHolborn Hill to the Bank, and Ludgate Hill to the same point, being made\r\ncrooked and with steep acclivities instead of straight and level, as Sir\r\nChristopher Wren designed them. It is to be regretted that the\r\ndiscussions on the rebuilding of Hamburg have presented an instance of a\r\nsimilar conflict of local interests, which, in a few instances, has been\r\nso far successful as to preserve several dense masses of crowded and\r\nunwholesome habitations for the poorer classes, in the face of the\r\nrecent experience of the sort of population which, to the surprise of\r\nthe better classes of inhabitants, issued out of them and made the city\r\nat the time of its destruction a scene of plunder and anarchy more\r\nterrible than the fire itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. 10.\r\n   LETTER FROM THE TOWN CLERK OF STOCKPORT, ON INFANTICIDES COMMITTED\r\n                  PARTLY FOR THE SAKE OF BURIAL MONEY.\r\n\r\n DEAR SIR,                              _Stockport, 25th January, 1843._\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that infanticide to a considerable extent has been\r\ncommitted in the borough of Stockport; and I have been professionally\r\nengaged in prosecuting two distinct charges of infanticide, of which I\r\ngive you the following summary:—\r\n\r\nThe first case was against Robert Standring, by trade a hatter. He had a\r\nfemale child about sixteen years of age, who, from imbecility, was not\r\nvery likely to obtain her own living. One morning, about five o’clock,\r\nhe sent her to call up a labouring hatter, with whom he (the father) was\r\ngoing to work during the day; but, previous to his so sending her, he\r\ngave the child some coffee. After the child’s return she was seized with\r\nvomiting, and all the usual symptoms of illness caused by mineral\r\npoison, and died during the course of that day. The coroner (the late\r\nMr. Hollins) held an inquest on the body, but refused to allow any\r\nsurgical examination; and charging the jury that the death was a natural\r\none, such a verdict was returned. In about three months afterwards, the\r\ncase, and some suspicious circumstances, came to the knowledge of the\r\nStockport police; and I was consulted as town-clerk and clerk to the\r\njustices. The magistrates issuing a warrant for the exhumation of the\r\nbody, I attended with a competent surgeon and chemist (Mr. John Rayner),\r\nand a large—very large quantity of arsenic was found in the stomach, and\r\nall parts of the body which could be affected by arsenic taken\r\ninternally were remarkably preserved from putrefaction. Standring, being\r\napprehended, was tried before Mr. Justice Coleridge at the Chester\r\nAssizes. The judge apparently summed up for a conviction; but the jury,\r\nafter a long deliberation, returned a verdict of acquittal. The verdict\r\nwas an extraordinary one, and can only be accounted for by the general\r\nfeeling against capital punishments, which enables so many criminals\r\n(capitally indicted) to escape any punishment.\r\n\r\nThe inducement for this murder, so far as it could be ascertained, was\r\nof a twofold character; partly to obtain money from the burial friendly\r\nsocieties, in which Standring had entered his child as a member, and\r\nfrom which he received about 8_l._, and partly to free himself from the\r\nfuture burthen of supporting the child. The judge, in summing up the\r\ncase for the consideration of the jury, remarked upon the apparent\r\ninadequacy of the motives for the murder; but, with all due deference to\r\nhis lordship, when it is known to be an established fact that Mr.\r\nAshton, a manufacturer of Hyde, was murdered by two miscreants whose\r\nonly inducement was 10_l._ divided between them, there can be no scale\r\nlaid down to indicate the lowest price for murder.\r\n\r\nThe other case involved no less than three distinct cases of murder.\r\nRobert Sandys, and Ann his wife, and George Sandys, and Honor his wife,\r\nwere brothers and sisters-in-law, living in Stockport, in two adjoining\r\ncellars. They were bear or mat makers. Robert had two sons and two\r\ndaughters, all young children, and George had a female child also very\r\nyoung. Two of the female children of Robert Sandys were one morning\r\ntaken very ill, and one of them died the same day, under very suspicious\r\ncircumstances, the neighbours publicly declaring that the children must\r\nbe poisoned. These two girls (along with their brother, a little boy\r\nabout five years of age) having been in the morning of the illness in\r\nthe company of Bridget Ryley (a girl of inoffensive but imbecile mind),\r\ntheir mother, Ann Sandys, after the neighbours said the children must\r\nhave been poisoned, said, “Oh, Bridget Ryley must have given them\r\nsomething.” Bridget Ryley had given them some cold cabbage, which Ann\r\nSandys well knew, and the boy who had been with them was not at all\r\nunwell. Bridget Ryley was apprehended, and by accident I was present at\r\nthe coroner’s inquest. I came in just at its termination, Bridget Ryley\r\nbeing in custody, and Ann Sandys being about to close her examination.\r\nAfter she had concluded her examination, which was very strong against\r\nBridget Ryley, she began to apologize for Bridget, saying, She did not\r\nthink the poor girl (as she called her) intended any harm to the child;\r\nand she evidently wished to make it appear that the poisoning was all a\r\nmatter of accident. Bridget Ryley was then asked to say what she knew\r\nabout the business, and she earnestly protested her innocence, saying\r\nthe child had died of the same complaint as another child of Ann Sandys\r\nhad died of three weeks before. It appeared strange that the mother of\r\nthe child should both criminate and exculpate Bridget Ryley, and I\r\nthought I could perceive a watchful restlessness in her eye, which ill\r\naccorded with the probable grief of a bereaved parent; I therefore\r\ncommunicated to the coroner my opinion that the mother of the children\r\nmight be the murderess, and that if so, the child which had been buried\r\nthree weeks before would also prove poisoned. The coroner thought it a\r\nvery proper inquiry, and adjourned the inquest, directing this other\r\nchild to be exhumed; and it proved to have been poisoned by arsenic.\r\nWhilst this exhumation was taking place, Honor Sandys met one of the\r\nconstables, and she expressed a wish that they would not disturb her\r\ndear little infant. The constable told me this, and directions were\r\nconsequently given for its immediate exhumation. Arsenic had also caused\r\nthe death of this child. Ann Sandys then said that Bridget Ryley must\r\nhave poisoned them all, and that a child which Bridget Ryley had nursed\r\nhad died in a similar way. (This was after Ann Sandys was in custody and\r\ncharged with this murder.) This last child so nursed by Bridget Ryley\r\nwas exhumed, but it had died a natural death. Now all these three\r\nchildren so poisoned were in friendly burial societies, and their\r\nparents would receive for their funerals about 3_l._ for each child. The\r\nexpense of the funeral would be about 1_l._, and the profit on each\r\nmurder 2_l._, and the liberation from the future expense of keeping the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAt the ensuing assizes for Chester Mr. Justice Coltman postponed the\r\ntrial to enable the boy, the son of Ann Sandys, to be educated for\r\nexamination. This boy would have proved some very material facts as to\r\nthe mode in which the poison was administered, but as this did not come\r\nout in evidence, as the boy was not considered capable of being examined\r\nat the subsequent assizes, it is hardly fair now to state them.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Erskine tried the cases, and Robert Sandys was convicted,\r\nbut his wife Ann Sandys acquitted. I afterwards was told by one of the\r\njury that they acquitted her because they thought she acted under the\r\ncontrol of her husband, and they thought that justified her acquittal.\r\nThe judge and counsel had been silent on this point, satisfied with\r\ntheir own knowledge, that in murder the wife, though acting with her\r\nhusband, is guilty and punishable, and thinking the jury as wise as\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of an objection to the admissability of a statement made\r\nby Ann Sandys before the coroner, and also to the form of the\r\nindictment, judgment was respited to the following assizes. The judges\r\ndetermined for the Crown on both points, and sentence of death was\r\npassed on Robert Sandys. Afterwards, and without any communication to\r\nthe parties prosecuting, the sentence of death was commuted to\r\ntransportation for life. George and Honor Sandys were not tried, as the\r\nevidence was not so conclusive against them, and Robert and Ann were\r\nbelieved to be the principals in these murders.\r\n\r\nI know it to be the opinion of some of the respectable medical\r\npractitioners in Stockport that infanticides have been commonly\r\ninfluenced by various motives—to obtain the burial moneys from the\r\nsocieties in question, and to be relieved from the burthen of the\r\nchild’s support. The parties generally resort to a mineral poison,\r\nwhich, causing sickness, and sometimes purging, assumes the appearance\r\nof the diseases to which children are subject; and as they then take the\r\nchild to a surgeon who prescribes after a very cursory examination, they\r\nthus escape any suspicion on the part of their neighbours. Each child in\r\nSandys’ case was so treated, but they took care not to administer the\r\nphysic obtained.\r\n\r\nHow to prevent these infanticides is a question of great difficulty. I\r\nthink these societies are of great use if under proper regulation and\r\ninspection. These cases may be good argument for requiring the due\r\ninspection, after death, of each child in a burial society by a surgical\r\nexaminer, who might judge, in most cases, whether a _post-mortem_\r\nexamination were advisable or not; but as these societies are very\r\nuseful on the whole, the partial misuse of them cannot avail against\r\ntheir general use. Probably an application to these societies of the law\r\napplicable to life assurance companies might tend to prevent the crime\r\nof infanticide. The object of these burial societies is the decent\r\ninterment of the deceased member. In life insurance companies no person\r\nis by law allowed to recover from an insurance company more money than\r\nthe value of his interest in the life of the person whose life is\r\ninsured: for instance, should his interest in a life lease be worth\r\n500_l._ he may insure and recover 500_l._, but not 600_l._ He therefore\r\nreceives by the policy that which he loses by the death, and no more. If\r\nhe has no interest the policy is void. Now, applying this principle to\r\nthese burial societies would make it necessary that some officer of the\r\nsociety should prepare for and superintend the interment of the child,\r\nand that no further sum than requisite for the decent interment should\r\nbe expended, and no money in any case should be paid to the friends of\r\nthe deceased; also, no party should be insured in more than one society.\r\n\r\nNone of our registrars of births and deaths are medical men, and no case\r\nof infanticide has been discovered through the instrumentality of the\r\nRegistration Act.\r\n\r\nI shall be glad to furnish you with the briefs in these cases of murder,\r\nshould you desire them, or with any further information in my power.\r\n\r\nIn all four deaths each child was in a burial society, and arsenic was\r\nindisputably the cause of death.\r\n\r\nI may also mention that each death was of a female child. The male\r\nchildren, more likely to be useful to their parents, were in each case\r\nspared.\r\n\r\n                    I have the honour to be,\r\n                              Your most obedient servant,\r\n                                             HENRY COPPOCK,\r\n                                    _Town Clerk of Stockport, and\r\n                                          Clerk to the Stockport Union_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[In answer to a subsequent inquiry, Mr. Coppock stated that at the time\r\nthe offences detailed in the above letter were committed, both the\r\nparties were in employment. Standring was a hatter, in full work, and\r\nmaking with industry 20_s._ a-week; the Sandys, Robert and George, were\r\nmat-makers, not making more than from 7_s._ to 10_s._ per week each; the\r\nwomen contributing, it is presumed, to the earnings of the family.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. 11.\r\n   A RETURN OF THE AVERAGE AGES AT WHICH DEATHS AND FUNERALS OCCURRED\r\n DURING THE YEAR 1839 TO THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF SOCIETY IN THE SEVERAL\r\n        SUPERINTENDENT REGISTRARS’ DISTRICTS OF THE METROPOLIS.\r\n\r\n  Also of the PROPORTIONATE NUMBERS of DEATHS to the POPULATION of\r\n    each such District: setting forth the excess in Numbers of Deaths\r\n    and Funerals in each such District above the proportionate Numbers\r\n    of Deaths and Funerals in healthy and well-conditioned Town\r\n    Districts: setting forth also the amount of Reduction of the\r\n    ordinary Duration of Life of each Class in the District, as\r\n    compared with the standards of Longevity afforded by the Insurance\r\n    Tables deduced from the experience of the Population of Carlisle,\r\n    and of the County of Hereford.\r\n\r\nThe explanations given in respect to the totals inserted at § 37 are\r\napplicable to the annexed district returns, which are only submitted as\r\nthe best approximations that can be obtained in the present state of the\r\nregistration. The practical bearing of the consideration of the ages of\r\ndeaths as well as the proportionate numbers of deaths on the subject of\r\nprovision for funerals is shown in §§ 72, 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81, also\r\n§§ 160, 161, 163, 169, 173, and note to § 150, also § 205. For the sake\r\nof those who are engaged as members of committees in the investigation\r\nof the health of the populous towns and the causes of mortality, it may\r\nbe of public use to give full explanations of the principles on which\r\nreturns should be made to measure the relative pressure of those causes\r\nin different localities, or amongst different classes of the community:\r\nit may also be of use to show the necessity of careful provisions for\r\nthe registration of facts which are of great importance to every\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nDr. Price, in his work on Annuities and Reversionary Payments, states\r\nthat in his time the proportion of deaths in London within the bills of\r\nmortality was rather more than 1 to 22 of the population annually, which\r\nhe states as an equivalent proposition to saying that the average\r\nduration of life to all who died was 22 years. Again he observes that—\r\n\r\n“One with another, then, they will have an expectation of life of 22½\r\nyears; that is, one of 22½ will die every year.” p. 255.\r\n\r\nIn p. 274, that—\r\n\r\n“In the dukedom of Wurtemberg, the inhabitants, Mr. Susmilch says, are\r\nnumbered every year; and from the average of 5 years, ending in 1754, it\r\nappeared that taking the towns and country together, 1 in 32 died\r\nannually. In another province which he mentions, consisting of 635,998\r\ninhabitants, 1 in 33 died annually. From these facts he concludes, that,\r\ntaking a whole country in _gross_, including all cities and villages,\r\nmankind enjoy among them about 32 or 33 years each of existence. This\r\nvery probably is below the truth; from whence it will follow, that a\r\nchild born in a country parish or village has at least an expectation of\r\n36 or 37 years; supposing the proportion of _country_ to _town_\r\ninhabitants, to be as 3½ to 1, which, I think, this ingenious writer’s\r\nobservations prove to be nearly the case in Pomerania, Brandenburg, and\r\nsome other kingdoms.”\r\n\r\nBy Mr. Milne, in his work on Annuities, and in his article on Mortality\r\nin the last edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, by Dr. Bissett\r\nHawkins, and by nearly all statistical writers, the proportions of\r\ndeaths to the population, and the average ages of death, are treated as\r\nequivalent. Dr. Southwood Smith has been misled to adopt the same view.\r\nHe states in his work on the Philosophy of Health, p. 135, that “There\r\nis reason to believe that the mortality at present throughout Europe,\r\ntaking all countries together, including towns and villages, and\r\ncombining all classes into one aggregate, is 1 in 36. Susmilch, a\r\ncelebrated German writer, who flourished about the middle of the last\r\ncentury, estimated it at this average at that period. The result of all\r\nMr. Finlaison’s investigations is, that the average for the whole of\r\nEurope does not materially differ at the present time.” “It has been\r\nshown that the average mortality at present at Ostend is 1 in 36, which\r\nis the same thing as to assert that a new-born child at Ostend has an\r\nexpectation of 35½ years of life.”\r\n\r\nHaving of late had occasion to make rather extensive observations on\r\nthis subject, it appears to be a public duty to state, that in no class\r\nof persons, in no district or country, and in no tract of time, has the\r\nfact hitherto appeared to be in coincidence with this hypothesis; and\r\nalso that returns of the proportions of deaths to the population, when\r\ntaken singly as the exponents of the average duration of life, are often\r\nmischievously misleading, exaggerating those chances of life sometimes\r\nto the extent of double the real amount. If Dr. Price, instead of\r\nresting satisfied with Susmilch’s hypothesis, had taken the actual ages\r\nof the dying within the bills of mortality, he would have found only a\r\ncasual approximation to the hypothesis for the whole metropolis; and if\r\nhe had taken the worst conditioned districts, that, as applied to them,\r\nit was in error full one-half. On Mr. Milne’s own data it appears that\r\nthe proportions of deaths to the population at Carlisle, instead of\r\ncoinciding with the ascertained average ages of death, 38·72, were in\r\nthe year 1780, 1 in 35; in 1787, they were 1 in 43; and in 1801, they\r\nwere 1 in 44. Having caused an average to be deduced from the actual\r\nages of 5,200,141 deaths which occurred in the Prussian States from 1820\r\nto 1834, instead of 36 years, the actual average age of deaths was only\r\n28 years and 10 months. The average ages of death in France, as deduced\r\nfrom Duvillard’s table, founded on the experience of one million of\r\ndeaths, instead of being 36 years, was 28 years and 5 months.\r\n\r\nThe public errors created and maintained by taking the proportions of\r\ndeaths as exponents of the average ages of death, or of the chances of\r\nlife to the population, may be illustrated by reference to the actual\r\nexperience amongst nearly two millions of the population, or upwards of\r\nforty-five thousand deaths in thirty-two districts, equivalent to as\r\nmany populous towns, which the Registrar-General has obligingly enabled\r\nme to examine for the year 1839.\r\n\r\nThe Carlisle table is taken as the standard for the duration of life, to\r\nmeasure the loss of life in the several districts, as it gives the\r\nprobability of life from infancy, well ascertained for one town, and\r\nnearly coincides with the experience of the annuity offices on the\r\nselect class of lives insured by them, and with the results which I have\r\nobtained from the mortuary registries showing the average age of death\r\nin the county of Hereford. Each of the recognized insurance tables may,\r\nhowever, be used. If the Carlisle table be taken, the chances of life at\r\ninfancy would be 38·72; by the Chester table it would be 36·70; by the\r\nNorthampton, 25·18; by the Montpellier table, 25·36; by the last Swedish\r\ntable, 39·39; by the experience of Geneva, 40·18. After the attainment\r\nof twenty years of age these several tables give the chances of life as\r\nfollows:—by the Carlisle table it would be 41·46; by the Chester table,\r\n36·48; by the Northampton table, 33·43; by the Montpellier table, 37·99;\r\nby the Swedish table, 39·98; by the Geneva experience, 37·67; and by the\r\nexperience of the Equitable Society, 41·67. For civic purposes in this\r\ncountry, the most important period for considering the chances of life\r\nis after coming of age, or after the attainment of twenty-one years; the\r\naverage ages of all who die above that age in each district of the\r\nmetropolis are therefore given to illustrate the extent of loss of life\r\nto each class of adults, which is the more important to be observed, as\r\nit has been hastily supposed that the pressure of the more common and\r\nremovable causes of disease is almost exclusively upon the infant\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the errors occasioned by taking the proportions of\r\ndeaths as the exponent of the duration of life; if we take the\r\nproportions of deaths in the district of Islington, with its population\r\nof 55,720, we find the deaths for the year only 1 to every 55 of the\r\npopulation, which would appear to be a highly healthy standard; whereas,\r\nwhen we examine the average age of death of all of that population who\r\nhave died during that year, we find it to be only 29 years: in other\r\nwords, we find that the average duration of the period of existence has\r\neven in that district been shortened by at least nine years to all, and\r\nto an extent of at least six years on the average to the class of\r\nadults. If we examine the pressure of the causes of death upon each\r\nclass of the community, in the same district, we find that the class of\r\nartisans, instead of attaining 39 _years_, have, on the average, been\r\ncut off at 19 years; and hence that children and adults, and on the\r\naverage all those of the labouring classes who have died, have been\r\ndeprived of 20 years of the natural expectation of life; and that even\r\nthe class of adults who have died have been deprived of 15 years of\r\nworking ability, involving extensive orphanage and premature widowhood.\r\nIf we take such a district as Bethnal Green, inhabited by weavers and a\r\nbadly conditioned population, the returns of the proportionate number of\r\ndeaths to the population (1 in 41) would lead to the supposition of an\r\naverage vitality of nearly double the real amount, which appears from\r\nthis year’s return to be only 22 years for the whole population. For the\r\nworking classes in that district it is no more than 18 years. If we\r\ncarry investigations closer, and into the local causes of the mortality,\r\nwe have them developed in such evidence as that given by Mr. T. Taylor,\r\none of the registrars of that district;—or in other districts by such\r\ninformation as that given by Mr. Worrell, the registrar of St. Pancras,\r\nor by registrars of St. George’s, Hanover Square, or by the registrar of\r\na district of Marylebone, where we find the state of overcrowding (noted\r\nin § 26), combined with the insufficient supplies of water, the\r\ndefective drainage and neglect of cleansing which is described in the\r\nanswers—attended by a reduction of 12 years’ duration of life to the\r\nadult artisans. In the opulent parish of St. George’s, Hanover Square,\r\nit is attended by a loss of 16 years; in Marylebone and in St. Pancras,\r\nby a loss of 17 years. The external and internal circumstances of the\r\nlabouring population, where such results have been obtained, vary\r\nwidely, and the results are commonly the mean of extreme differences.\r\nFor example, in the parish of St. Margaret’s, Leicester, which has a\r\npopulation of 22,000, almost all of whom are artisans engaged in the\r\nmanufacture of stockings, where the average age of death in the whole\r\nparish was, during the year 1840, 18 years, I succeeded in obtaining the\r\nages of death in the different _streets_, when it appeared that this\r\naverage was made up as follows:—Average age of deaths in the streets\r\nthat were drained (and that by no means perfectly) 23½ years; in the\r\nstreets that were partially drained, 17½ years; in the streets that were\r\nentirely undrained, 13½ years. Though the defective drainage and\r\ncleansing was the main cause, it was doubtless not the only cause of\r\nthis variation. That, however, was a year of a heavy mortality, and the\r\naverage age of death in that and another district during the years 1840,\r\n1841, and 1842, was in the streets drained 25½ years; in those partly\r\ndrained 21, and those not drained, 17 years. The general average was 21\r\nyears. The proportions of death to the population in Leicester were\r\nduring the same period, 1 in 36½. The inquiries promoted in the\r\ndistricts of other towns have developed instances of large masses of\r\npopulation amongst whom even lower average duration of life than any\r\nnoted in the first report is attendant on the circumstances described as\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nSo far as estimates of the number of the people before a census was\r\ntaken may be depended upon, it appears that the proportionate numbers of\r\ndeaths in the metropolis were, at the commencement of the last century,\r\n1 to 20. At the time the first census was taken (1801) the proportion of\r\ndeaths to the population within the bills of mortality appeared to be 1\r\nto 39. At the present time it appears to be 1 to 40. Having had the\r\naverage ages of death within the bills of mortality in the metropolis\r\ncalculated from the earliest to the later returns published, they appear\r\nto be, as far as they can be made out from the returns, which are only\r\ngiven in quinquennial and decennial periods, as follows:—\r\n\r\nOf all returned as having died during the\r\n\r\n                                        The average Age was\r\n                                         Years,    Months.\r\n           22 years, from 1728 to 1749         25          1\r\n           25 years, from 1750 to 1774         25          6\r\n           25 years, from 1775 to 1799         26          0\r\n           25 years, from 1800 to 1825         29          0\r\n            6 years, from 1826 to 1830         29         10\r\n\r\nThus, whilst it would appear from the proportionate numbers of deaths to\r\nthe population that the average duration of life in the metropolis has\r\ndoubled during the last century, it appears from the returns of the\r\naverage ages themselves that it has only increased four years and nine\r\nmonths, or about one-fifth. The district of the old bills of mortality\r\ncomprehends little more than one-half of the metropolis. The average age\r\nof death for the year 1839 for the whole metropolis, it will have been\r\nseen, is only 27 years. So far as an average for that year for the old\r\ndistrict can be made out from the several recent district returns, it\r\nwould appear to be no more than 26 years. But the earlier mortuary\r\nregistration was known to be extremely defective, especially in the\r\nregistration of deaths in the poorer districts, and the recent lower\r\naverages are ascribable to the closer registration of the infantile\r\nmortality in those districts. The earlier returns are only to be\r\nregarded in so far as the errors from period to period are likely to\r\nhave compensated each other; they are only adduced as indicating the\r\ndegree of proportionate progression, correspondent with the general\r\nphysical improvements of the population. But the slow general\r\nimprovement, made up by the great improvements of particular classes, is\r\nconsistent with the positive deterioration of others. The average age of\r\ndeath of the whole of the working classes we have seen is still no more\r\nthan 22 years in the whole of the metropolis. In large sub-districts, if\r\nwe could distinguish accurately the classes of deaths, the average would\r\nbe found to be not more than half that period: a rate of mortality\r\nascribable to increased over-crowding and stationary accommodation,\r\ngreatly below anything that probably existed at the commencement of the\r\ncentury. The chief errors in the existing returns are errors which cause\r\nthe extent of the evils which depress the sanitary condition of the\r\npopulation, and the mortality consequent on those evils to be under\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous conclusions as to the ages of the populations from the\r\nproportions of deaths, have perhaps arisen from assumptions of the\r\nexistence of states of things rarely, if ever, found, namely, perfectly\r\nstationary populations and perfectly stationary causes of death. I have\r\nbeen asked “If 1 out of 40 die yearly, must not the average age of all\r\nwho die be 40 years?” The answer, by actual experience, as we have seen,\r\nis, that it is often not 30 years; and perhaps the reason why it is not\r\nso will be most conveniently illustrated by hypothetical cases. For\r\nexample, let it be assumed that in any given year 40 persons die out of\r\n1600, which is in the proportion of 1 to 40, and in consequence of an\r\nunusual prevalence of measles, or some disease to which children are\r\nsubject, the greater number of deaths occur amongst the infant portion\r\nof the population, and hence, out of the 40 deaths, 20 occur at 5 years\r\nof age, 10 at 25, and 10 at 60. Then the total existence had, would have\r\nbeen (20 × 5) + (10 × 25) + (10 × 60) = 100 + 250 + 600 = 950 years, and\r\nthis divided by 40, the number who died would give 950/40 = 24 years\r\nnearly as the average duration of life to each of the 40 who died.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, suppose a severe winter, in which the peculiar causes\r\nof mortality may have pressed unusually heavy upon the older lives, and\r\nlet the numbers who died have been 20, at 60 years of age; 10 at 40; and\r\n10 at 5; in such case, the total existence enjoyed would have been (20 ×\r\n60) + (10 × 40) + (10 × 5) = 1200 + 400 + 50 = 1650 years, which,\r\ndivided by 40, would give 1650/40 = 41¼ years as the average duration of\r\nlife to each.\r\n\r\nAnd again, where, in fact, the proportion of death in one year may be\r\nrepresented as 1 death out of 20 of the population; the average\r\nexistence enjoyed may be greater than when 1 in 40 died for the reason\r\ngiven in the former case. As for example, in the year when 1 in 20 died,\r\nit may have happened that the deaths were among the older lives, and\r\nthat, taking one with another, the average age of all who died might be\r\n50; while in the other case the mortality might have been amongst the\r\ninfant population, when the average age might have been 20. If the\r\nproportion of 1 in 40, or 1 in 20, were to obtain each year\r\ncontinuously, taking one life with another, the average duration to a\r\npopulation just born, of whom 1 in 40 died, and whose place should be\r\nsupplied each year by a new birth, would be about 20 years to each life,\r\nor one-half; and of a similar population, of whom 1 out of 20 died\r\nannually, the average duration of life to each would be about 10 years,\r\nor one-half the period at the expiration of which all the lives would\r\nhave expired.\r\n\r\nWhen these examples are considered, it will be understood that the\r\naverage age of death may remain stationary, or may go on increasing,\r\nwhilst the proportions of death remain the same, or vary. The actual\r\nmortality of most districts is found to be coincident chiefly with its\r\nphysical condition, and is most accurately measured by the years of\r\nvitality which have been enjoyed, _i. e._, by the average age of death.\r\nThe numbers of deaths increase or diminish considerably, and frequently\r\ncreate erroneous impressions, whilst the average ages of death are found\r\nto maintain a comparatively steady course, always nearest to the actual\r\ncondition of the population, and give the most sure indications.\r\n\r\nThe chief test of the pressure of the causes of mortality is then the\r\nduration of life in years: and whatever age may be taken as the standard\r\nof the natural age or the average age of the individual in any community\r\nmay be taken to correct the returns of the proportions of death in that\r\nsame community. For example, in the returns of the St. George’s, Hanover\r\nSquare district, it appears that in 1839, the proportions of deaths was\r\n1 to 50 of the population; but the average number of years which 1325\r\nindividuals who died during that year had lived, was only 31 years, or 8\r\nyears below the average period of life in Carlisle. There was then in\r\nthat district during that year a total loss of 10,600 years of life,\r\nwhich at 39 years may be considered as equal to an excess of deaths of\r\n272 persons, and in a healthy state the proportions of deaths should\r\nhave been 1 in 63 instead of 1 in 50 of the population. The excess in\r\nnumbers of deaths in the metropolis has been measured by this standard,\r\nthe total number of years of life, would in a healthy community have\r\nbeen divided in portions of not less than 39 years to every individual\r\nwho died.\r\n\r\nThe effect of migration or of emigration, in disturbing the results of\r\nreturns of the average ages of death in particular localities appears to\r\nbe commonly much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nAs formerly, when navy surgeons, overlooking the filth of their ships,\r\nwhich has since been removed, and not perceiving the effects of the\r\natmospheric impurities arising from the overcrowding, which have since\r\nbeen diminished by better ventilation, directed their whole attention to\r\nsupposed distant causes and mysterious agencies, and were wont to\r\nascribe the whole of the fever which ravaged a fleet to infection from\r\nsome casual hand, who was found to have been received on board from some\r\nequally filthy and ill kept prison where the “gaol fever” had been\r\nprevalent; so now, in some of our towns, we find much ingenuity\r\nexercised to avoid the immediate force of the facts presented by such\r\nreturns, by a search for collateral and incidental defects in them. Thus\r\nin Liverpool the whole of its vast excess of mortality has been charged\r\nupon the poorer passengers who pass through the port. In other towns\r\nalso, all the excess of deaths from epidemic or infectious disease is\r\ncharged upon the vagrant population. In New York and some of the\r\nAmerican cities, where inquiries have been stimulated by the example of\r\nthe sanitary inquiry in this country, a common observation made on the\r\nproved excess of mortality is, that a large proportion of “foreigners”\r\nfrequent the city. An inquiry into the cases themselves would generally\r\nshow that if, instead of the proportion of the immigrant population\r\nbeing: a small per-centage, it formed a very large proportion of the\r\npopulation included: still the proportion per cent. of sickness and\r\nmortality, from consumption and other diseases, amongst the resident\r\npopulation, is the greatest; and that even in lodging-houses the disease\r\nroost frequently appears first in the occupants who are stationary, and\r\nlast in the new comers. In some badly conditioned districts, where there\r\nis a very severe mortality observable on children, a less proportionate\r\namount of mortality prevails amongst the adults who are migrant, than on\r\nother adults resident in somewhat less depressed districts, but who are\r\nmore stationary. Of all classes (unless it be the higher classes who\r\nresort to watering-places) it is not the sickly and the weakly who\r\ntravel for subsistence as handicraftsmen, or for subsistence in\r\ncommerce, but the healthy and robust. In so far as the general results\r\nof mortuary registration of any district are disturbed by a population\r\nwho are migrant (who are not only above the average strength, but who\r\ngenerally come with the additional advantage of health by travel in the\r\nopen air and in a purer atmosphere), they are usually disturbed by\r\nunduly raising and giving the locality an appearance of an average of\r\nhealth, and the fatally deceptive chances of longevity that do not\r\nbelong to it Whilst therefore the localities gain by the average health\r\nand strength of the migrant population, other districts have the credit\r\nof a share of the excess of disease and mortality which really belong to\r\nunhealthy localities. In other words, the population migrating through\r\nsuch districts carry away more disease and mortality from the crowded\r\ndistricts than they take into them. If there had been a mortuary\r\nregistration at Walcheren, or any pestilential stations productive of an\r\nexcessive mortality in the army, the registries probably would not have\r\ngiven the localities credit for more than half the mortality which\r\nbelonged to them. The real sickness and mortality of the more depressed\r\ntown districts are often made to appear lower than they are by the\r\nnumber of cases treated in distant workhouses, hospitals, and\r\ndispensaries, for which no credit is given to the locality where the\r\ncause of death occurred.\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless proportionately enhance the value of such returns as\r\nthose in question, if the rule were fully carried out that “the\r\npopulation enumerated must always be precisely that which produces the\r\ndeaths registered;” the grand desideratum being, as expressed by Mr.\r\nMilne, for insurance purposes, “to determine the number of annual deaths\r\nat each age which takes place among the living at the same age;”[43] but\r\nthe facts cited of the greater proportion of adults, and of health in\r\nthose adults who are immigrant, will answer the objections to the\r\nsuperior applicability to local or class insurance tables, deduced from\r\nactual local observation of the local rate of mortality prevalent\r\namongst that population, whether migrant or stationary, and without\r\nreference to the actual ages of the living (though that were desirable),\r\ncompared with deductions from any general insurance table, _i. e._ the\r\nexperience of a distant and wholly unconnected population. Deductions\r\nfrom tables, however correctly made from the experience of other towns,\r\nmust he, and are proved, by such experience as that hereafter cited, to\r\nbe merely “guess-work.” Vide ‘General Sanitary Report,’ pp. 218, 219.\r\nFor myself, I make it a general rule of precaution neither to receive\r\nnor adduce statistical returns as evidence without previous inquiry,\r\nwherever it is possible, into the particulars on which they are founded,\r\nor with which they are connected. I adduce them less as principal\r\nevidence, proving anything by themselves, than as proximate measures, or\r\nas indications of the extent of the operation of causes substantiated by\r\ndistinct investigations. The general conclusions which the facts that\r\nhave come to my knowledge tend to establish on the subject of the\r\nexperience of mortality are, that there is no general law of mortality\r\nyet established that is applicable to all countries or to all classes,\r\nor to all times, as commonly assumed; that every place, and class, and\r\nperiod has rather its own circumstances and its own law, varying with\r\nthose circumstances; that the actual experience of any class or place,\r\nor period, even with the disturbance of any ordinary amount of\r\nmigration, or immigration, or any ordinary influx of young lives from\r\nbirths, is a safer guide than any experience deduced from the experience\r\nof another people living at another time and place, or any assumed\r\ngeneral law.\r\n\r\nFor many public purposes, I have submitted it as a desideratum that\r\npopulation returns should give not merely the _numbers_ of each class,\r\nor of those engaged in each distinct occupation, which only enables us\r\nto resort to the fallacious standard of the proportionate numbers of\r\ndeaths, to judge of the mortality incidental to the class, but the total\r\nages of each class, which would serve as an index of alterations in the\r\nsanitary condition of that same class. Such returns of the total ages\r\nshould, for the public use, be reduced to their simplest proportions. In\r\nthe form in which they are usually given, only in intervals of\r\nquinquennial or decennial periods, they are extremely meagre, and\r\ninvolve so much inaccuracy in any attempts that might be made to use\r\nthem, for the purpose of comparing district with district, as to be\r\ngenerally useless. Whereas, if the ages of any class, or of the general\r\npopulation living in any district, and the ages of those of them who\r\ndie, were reduced to the simplest proportions—that is, if the total\r\nyears of age, whether of the living or dying, were divided by the total\r\nnumber of individuals from which the returns were made, the public would\r\nbe enabled to make comparisons between district and district, and to\r\njudge of the relative degrees of pressure, in each, of the causes of\r\nmortality. As the simple proportions of average ages of the living have\r\nnot yet, that I am aware of, been used, or even calculated in any\r\ninstance, I beg leave to exemplify them.\r\n\r\nMr. Griffith Davies is theoretically of opinion, on a formula of De\r\nMoivre, that in general the average age of death in any community is\r\nnecessarily higher than the average age of those living in the same\r\ncommunity: and that in a stationary population the average age of death\r\nwill, under ordinary circumstances, be in the ratio of 3 to 2 higher\r\nthan the average age of the living. I have had the average age of the\r\nliving population, on which the experience embodied in the Carlisle\r\nInsurance table was founded, calculated: and if that may be considered\r\nto have been a stationary population, the proportion of the ages of the\r\nliving to those of the dying was practically as about 3 to 4: for whilst\r\nthe average age of the dying was 38–3/10, the average age of the living\r\npopulation was 32–9/10. The average age of the dying in Hereford, in\r\nwhich the increase of population had been very slight, was 39. But the\r\naverage age of the living population, so far as it can be made out from\r\nquinquennial returns, was 28 years and 5 months. On this and all returns\r\nof the ages of the living, in the mode in which the returns have been\r\ncollected, allowance must be made for understatements of ages by some of\r\nthe adult members of the community. On the whole, the proportion of the\r\nages of the living to the dying appears to be in an ordinarily healthy\r\nand stationary community, as about 3 to 4.\r\n\r\nAs yet the observations have not been on a sufficiently wide basis; but\r\nit appears that wherever there is any divergence between the average\r\nages of the living and the average ages of the dying, the divergence\r\nbeyond their natural proportions may be taken as indicating the\r\nproportionate operation of some disturbing cause upon either line, as by\r\nsome extraordinary increase of births, or by immigration or emigration,\r\non the average ages of the living, and on the line of the average ages\r\nof the dead.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have been enabled to observe or collect from the extremely\r\nimperfect data at present available to the public service, the line of\r\nthe average ages of the living is comparatively steady; the disturbances\r\nby migration and immigration which often compensate each other, for the\r\nsame place and period, being much the same at different periods, and\r\nseldom affect the results materially, whilst the variations in the\r\npressure of the causes of death from year to year, are usually\r\nconsiderable, and warrant the assumption that in general the\r\ndisturbances occasioning the divergence described, are from the\r\noperations of causes of death upon that line. Wherever the pressure of\r\nthe causes of death has yet been observed to be very great, there the\r\nline of mortality, or the average age of death, is below, what may be\r\ncalled, the line of vitality constituted by the average age of the\r\nliving; and wherever there is on the whole any diminution of those\r\ncauses of death, as by better ventilation, or by widening streets,\r\nopening new thoroughfares, better supplies of water, sewering and\r\ncleansing, and improvements in the general habits of the population,\r\nthere the line of mortality, the infantile mortality especially,\r\ndiminishes, the average age of each adult class, up to sexagenarians or\r\noctogenarians, increases, and the average age of death ascends above the\r\naverage age of the living. The means of observation are as yet too few\r\nto elicit more than indications for the guidance of sustained\r\ninvestigation, to determine whether the divergence of the two lines may\r\nbe reduced to any rule.\r\n\r\nIn Liverpool,—where the investigations into the condition of the\r\nresident cellar population certainly show an increase of the causes of\r\ndeath,—overcrowding, defective ventilation, bad supplies of water, and\r\nincreased filth,—the average age of death is, for the whole town, 17 or\r\n18 years only, whilst the average age of the living population, so far\r\nas it can be made out from the mode in which the census is prepared, is\r\n24 years. As far as can be ascertained by reference to previous\r\nregistries of one large parish, where the ages of the dead were formerly\r\nentered, the average duration of life in that town has gradually fallen.\r\nThe average ages of all who were buried in St. Nicholas parish between\r\nthe years 1784 and 1809 was 25.\r\n\r\nIn Manchester, the average age of the living is 25 years, but the\r\naverage age of the dying is only 18. In Leeds, the average age of the\r\nliving is also 25 years, but the average age of the dying is only 21.\r\n\r\n                                                         Years.  Months.\r\n\r\n The average age of all who _live_ in the town parishes\r\n   of Middlesex, so far as they can be made out from the      26       2\r\n   only available materials,—the returns in quinquennial\r\n   periods,—is only\r\n\r\n But the average age of all who _die_, judging from one       27       0\r\n   year’s return, appears to be about\r\n\r\nIf, however, we allow for the understatement of ages, the two lines for\r\nthe whole metropolis would be nearly coincident. On the experience of\r\nCarlisle and Hereford, the average age of death should be twelve years\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nArranging the several districts of the metropolis, in the order of the\r\naverage age of deaths, we find the average age of the living decrease\r\nwith the average age of the dying; and the proportion of births to the\r\npopulation increase with the decrease of the average age of death. The\r\nexcess in the proportionate number of births beyond the proportions in\r\nsuch a county as Hereford (1 to 44), where the average age of death is\r\nmuch higher, and proportionate number of deaths to the population,\r\nafford important indicia.\r\n\r\n ──────────────────┬────────┬─────────┬───────┬───────┬─────────────────\r\n                   │Average │ Average │Propor-│Propor-│\r\n Districts in which│ Age of │ Age of  │ tions │ tions │  Excess above\r\n   average Age of  │Death in│ all who │  of   │  of   │    County of\r\n Death of the whole│the Dis-│ live in │Births │Deaths │ Hereford in the\r\n   Population is   │ trict, │the Dis- │to the │to the │   Number of:\r\n                   │ of all │ trict.  │ Popu- │ Popu- │\r\n                   │Classes.│         │lation.│lation.│\r\n ──────────────────┼────────┼─────────┼───────┼───────┼─────────┬───────\r\n                   │        │         │       │       │ Deaths  │\r\n                   │        │         │       │       │   and   │Births.\r\n                   │        │         │       │       │Funerals.│\r\n ──────────────────┼────────┼─────────┼───────┼───────┼─────────┼───────\r\n                   │ Years. │yrs. mon.│       │       │         │\r\n Highest           │        │         │       │       │         │\r\n   (Comprising 2   │        │         │       │       │         │\r\n   Districts.)     │      35│  27   11│1 to 41│1 to 42│      966│    145\r\n   Population      │        │         │       │       │         │\r\n   120,678.        │        │         │       │       │         │\r\n 1.

But\r\nit must still be borne in mind, in the inspection of the returns from\r\nthe highest district, that the average is made up of districts which are\r\nprobably retrograding, connected with others which are advancing,—of\r\ndistricts such as are developed by Mr. Worrell, registrar, in his note\r\non one of the returns from St. Pancras, comprising streets, the\r\nconnected courts and alleys from which are widely as separate and\r\ndistinct in condition,—and, if I may use such an illustration, as little\r\nappropriate for any average that could be represented by numerals—as\r\nwere the conditions of Lazarus and Dives.\r\n\r\nEven the lowest proportion of deaths to the population presented in the\r\ndistrict returns, that of Hackney, where it is only 1 to 56. appears to\r\nbe a proportion in excess by nearly one-eighth, _i. e._ the deaths from\r\nepidemics, as well as the excess of more than one-third in the deaths of\r\nchildren under 10 years of age. The return, from the healthiest district\r\nin the returns, of the average age of deaths gives an average of 7\r\nyears’ loss of life for the whole population; whilst for the _adults_ of\r\nthe middle classes it gives 10 years, and for the _adults_ of the\r\nworking classes 7 years’ premature loss of life. Even in the county of\r\nHereford where there is a proportion of deaths of 1 to 64 of the\r\npopulation, and the standard of the Carlisle table of insurance where an\r\naverage age of 39 years of death is attained, it will be observed that\r\neven this average includes a large proportion (542), or nearly 1-third\r\nin the number of deaths under 10 years of age, and 123 or 1–14th deaths\r\nfrom epidemics, besides others involving deaths from preventible causes.\r\nOnly 329, or 1 in 5 of the deaths in this very healthy county, were\r\ndeaths registered as from old age. By the removal of this excess of\r\ndeaths, the excess of births which replace them would even in these\r\ndistricts be of course still further diminished.\r\n\r\nIt may be conjectured that if there were the means of distinguishing\r\naccurately the various classes of the living amongst whom these deaths\r\nfall, the irregularity of the proportionate number of deaths which\r\nprobably arise amongst the labouring classes would be accounted for. The\r\npresent returns of the number of births do not distinguish the classes\r\namongst whom the births occur. Taking the districts in the order of the\r\naverage age in which deaths occur to the labouring classes, and\r\ncomparing the proportions of the deaths and funerals with the\r\nproportions which occur in Hereford, the excess of deaths and funerals\r\nwas in 1839 as follows:—\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────────────┬───────────┬──────────────────────────┐\r\n │                              │Average Age│Excess in Number of Deaths│\r\n │Districts in which average Age│of Death of│ of Artisans, &c., in the │\r\n │of Death of Artisans, &c., is │ Artisans, │District above the Deaths │\r\n │                              │&c. in the │of Agricultural Labourers │\r\n │                              │Districts. │    in Herefordshire.     │\r\n ├──────────────────────────────┼───────────┼──────────────────────────┤\r\n │1.

They have attempted, amongst other improvements, to\r\nascertain not merely the total number of houses, but the number of each\r\ndescription of houses in each district. From the want of any system of\r\nmortuary or birth registration in Ireland their attempts to ascertain\r\ncorrectly the proportions of deaths and births to the population appear\r\nto have been to some degree frustrated; and the return of the average\r\nage of death must be received as an approximation, giving higher than\r\nthe real chances of life in that country. From the mode which the\r\ncommissioners adopted of collecting the ages of the living, by taking\r\nthe actual age of each individual with precautions, it appears probable\r\nthat their returns on this head are more trustworthy than those obtained\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of births to the population obtained by the Census\r\nCommissioners in Ireland are, I conceive, below the real amount; the\r\nproportions of deaths are confessedly so. The proportions of deaths and\r\nseveral other results may however serve for comparison between one\r\nprovince and another and between one county and another. I have taken\r\nthe following results from several of their tables, or have had them\r\ncalculated from their data. I submit them as indications of the\r\nmomentous public truths that still lie open for investigation, of which\r\ntruths the most important are the extent of the operation of the causes\r\nof mortality, which can only be correctly ascertained on the spot by\r\ninquiries for a mortuary registration, by responsible officers of\r\nsuperior qualifications and intelligence as officers of health. The\r\nfractional numbers are omitted in the returns from the provinces.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │                             │

duration of life in the worst\r\nconditioned districts is submitted as confirmatory of the principles\r\nexpounded in the General Sanitary report on the condition of the\r\nlabouring population in Great Britain. Vide p. 188, _et seq._\r\n\r\nConformity of the rate of increase of population with the ages of the\r\nliving and dying was not to be expected in the returns where the\r\nemigration from the different provinces is (probably) variable; but in\r\nthe two provinces where the household condition appears to be the worst,\r\nand the proportion of mud cabins the greatest, there we find the\r\nmortality is the highest.\r\n\r\nWhere the pressure of the causes of mortality is the greatest; where the\r\naverage age of death is the lowest, and the duration of life is the\r\nshortest, there the increase of population is the greatest. The\r\nproportion of children is great because life is short and the generation\r\ntransient; the middle aged and the aged are swept away in large\r\nproportions; and marriages are disproportionately early. But, says a\r\npolitical economist in an essay in support of Mr. Malthus’s original\r\nview, “The effect of wars, plagues, and epidemic disorders, those\r\nterrible correctives, as they have been justly termed by Dr. Short, of\r\nthe redundance of mankind on the principle of population, sets its\r\noperation in the most striking point of view. These scourges tend to\r\nplace an old country in the situation of a colony. They lessen the\r\nnumber of inhabitants, without, in most cases, lessening the capital\r\nthat is to feed and maintain them.” What I apprehend the actual facts\r\nwhen examined, place in a striking point of view, is the danger of\r\nadopting conclusions deeply affecting the interests of communities, on\r\nhypothetical reasonings, and without a careful investigation whether the\r\nfacts sustain them: the facts themselves, when examined, show that (be\r\nit as it may with war) epidemic disorders do _not_ lessen the number of\r\ninhabitants; and that they _do_ in all cases that have been examined\r\nlessen the capital that is to feed and maintain them. They lessen the\r\nproportion of productive hands and increase the proportion of the\r\nhelpless and dependent hands. They place every community, new or old, in\r\nrespect to its productive economy in the position which the farmer will\r\nunderstand by the like effects of epidemics upon his cattle, when in\r\norder to raise one horse two colts must be reared, and the natural\r\nperiod of work of the one reared is, by disease and premature death,\r\nreduced by one-third or one-half. The exposition already given, _vide_\r\nGeneral Report p. 176, _et seq._ p. 200, of the dreadful misery and\r\ndisease-sustaining fallacy which erects pestilence into a good, is\r\nfurther illustrated by the effects of the proportions of the dependent\r\npopulations of Ireland. Thus in England, the population above 15 and\r\nunder 50 years of age in every ten thousand is 5025, and this five\r\nthousand have 3600 children below 15 years of age dependent upon them.\r\nIn Ireland, the population above 15 years of age is 4900—in other words,\r\nthere are 125 less of adults in every ten thousand; and this smaller\r\nproportion of living adults, with eight or ten years’ span less of life\r\nor working ability, have 4050, or four hundred and fifty more children\r\ndependent upon them. In England there are 1,365 persons in every ten\r\nthousand, or 13½ per cent. above 50 years old to exercise the influence\r\nof their age and experience upon the community. In Ireland there are\r\nonly 10 per cent., or 1050 in every ten thousand of the population above\r\n50 years of age.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a report which the Census Commissioners give on the\r\nsanitary condition of Dublin, that the mortality in the different\r\nlocalities of that city varies with their physical condition in the\r\nlower districts, and coincides with the description already cited in the\r\ngeneral report, from the report of Dr. Speer, the physician to the\r\nDublin Fever Hospital (_vide_ General Sanitary Report, p. 96). The like\r\nconsequences follow to the lower Irish population settled in the English\r\ntowns with the like habits, which permit them to accumulate refuse round\r\ntheir dwellings, and live in an atmosphere compounded of the miasma of a\r\npigsty and a privy, and the smoke of a chimney in a crowded room. The\r\nCensus Commissioners of Ireland have endeavoured to obtain returns of\r\nthe chief causes of the mortality; and it appears from the report upon\r\nthem, that hitherto, notwithstanding all that has been said and written,\r\nthat fever has returned nearly decennially in periods, irrespective of\r\nany general distress in that country, and has extended its ravages to\r\nclasses who were exposed to the miasma, but who suffered no distress.\r\n“Cases of starvation,” it is stated, “have been registered from returns\r\nat almost every age, 79 of them took place in the rural district, or 1\r\ndeath in 11,539 of the general mortality of the open country, and minor\r\ntowns and villages: 18 in the civic, or 1 in 13,009 of the deaths in\r\ntowns of or above 2000 people; and 20 occurred in hospitals; the\r\npatients having been admitted when suffering from want of food, or in\r\nsuch a destitute condition as subsequently produced death from\r\nexhaustion. Including the deaths in hospitals with those in the civic\r\ndistricts, to which they properly belong, it appears that the deaths\r\nfrom want and destitution in the larger towns have been 1 in 7240 to the\r\ntotal mortality of these places. During the first 5-year period, these\r\ndeaths were on an average but 6 per annum, and in the last 5-year period\r\n(that ending June, 1841) they had increased to the yearly average of\r\n18.”\r\n\r\nThe dependency of the duration of life upon the physical condition of\r\nthe population, and the connexion of several classes of moral and\r\neconomical facts, with the proportionate mortality, may be further\r\nexemplified. Taking the four counties in Ireland in which the\r\nproportions of mud hovels are the greatest; and the four counties in\r\nwhich the proportions of such tenements are the least;[44] I have added\r\nthe average ages of death as additional proofs and exemplifications of\r\nthe conclusions stated in pp. 128 and 129, and other parts of the\r\nGeneral Report.\r\n\r\n ──────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────\r\n                               │  The four Counties where the average\r\n                               │     proportion of mud hovels, as\r\n                               │      habitations, is the lowest.\r\n ──────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────────────\r\n                               │  Down.

──────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe general sanitary condition of the population of Scotland and the\r\npressure of the preventible causes of death appears to be lower than in\r\nEngland, and higher than in Ireland, and so it appears from the recent\r\ncensus is the average age of the living.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived that the low average age of the living in these\r\ncases is ascribable mainly to an increasing proportion of children\r\nincidental to an increasing population. Not so, however: the average age\r\nof the living is more powerfully influenced by disturbing causes\r\naffecting the population of adults, each with accumulated years, than by\r\ncauses affecting the infantile population. One adult of 50 years added\r\nto the living is equal to the addition of 50 infants, and so with the\r\naverage ages of deaths. The average ages of the living appear to have\r\nincreased and not diminished with the increasing population. Be the\r\nsanitary condition of the poorest classes and the amount of disease and\r\ndeath what it may, as compared with former periods (and there is direct\r\nevidence that it is in populous districts increasing), there has been\r\nsome improvement in the residences of the middle and higher classes;\r\nhousehold drainage and cleanliness has in some districts been improved;\r\nthe quantity of town and land drainage and cultivation has of late\r\nincreased in various proportions in each country; and the decrease in\r\nthe causes of mortality appears to have been followed by an increase of\r\nthe average age of the living, of particular classes at the least,\r\nsufficient to present an increase, though a dreadfully slow one, in the\r\naverage age of the adults living. The increase of the proportion of\r\nadults may be represented as follows:—\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────\r\n                        │   England.    │   Ireland.    │   Scotland.\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────\r\n                        │ 1821    1841  │ 1821    1841  │ 1821    1841\r\n Percentage of          │               │               │\r\n   Population of 15     │ 39·09   36·07 │ 41·06   40·44 │ 41·0    36·4\r\n   Years and under      │               │               │\r\n Over 15 Years          │ 60·91   63·93 │ 58·94   59·56 │ 59·0    63·6\r\n ───────────────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────┼───────────────\r\n                        │Yrs.

I have been favoured with a copy\r\nof “_The Annual Report of the Interments in the City and County of New\r\nYork for the Year 1842_,” presented to the Common Council by Dr. John\r\nGriscom, the city inspector, in which it may be seen how little those\r\ncircumstances have hitherto preserved large masses of people from\r\nphysical depression. He has stepped out of the routine to examine on the\r\nspot the circumstances attendant on the mortality which the figures\r\nrepresent. He finds that upwards of 33,000 of the population of that\r\ncity live in cellars, courts, and alleys, of which 6618 are dwellers in\r\ncellars. “Many,” he states, “of these back places are so constructed as\r\nto cut off all circulation of air, the line of houses being across the\r\nentrance, forming a _cul de sac_, while those in which the line is\r\nparallel with, and at one side of the entrance, are rather more\r\nfavourably situated, but still excluded from any general visitation of\r\nair in currents. As to the influence of these localities upon the health\r\nand lives of the inmates, there is, and can be, no dispute; but few are\r\naware of the dreadful extent of the disease and suffering to be found in\r\nthem. In the damp, dark, and chilly cellars, fevers, rheumatism,\r\ncontagious and inflammatory disorders, affections of the lungs, skin,\r\nand eyes, and numerous others, are rife, and too often successfully\r\ncombat the skill of the physician and the benevolence of strangers.\r\n\r\n“I speak now of the influence of the locality merely. The degraded\r\nhabits of life, the filth, the degenerate morals, the confined and\r\ncrowded apartments, and insufficient food, of those who live in more\r\nelevated rooms, comparatively beyond the reach of the exhalations of the\r\nsoil, engender a different train of diseases, sufficiently distressing\r\nto contemplate, but the addition to all these causes of the foul\r\ninfluences of the incessant moisture and more confined air of\r\nunder-ground rooms, is productive of evils which humanity cannot regard\r\nwithout shuddering.”\r\n\r\nHe gives instances where the cellar population had been ravaged by fever\r\nwhilst the population occupying the upper apartments of the same houses\r\nwere untouched. In respect to the condition of these places, he cites\r\nthe testimony of a physician, who states that, “frequently in searching\r\nfor a patient living in the same cellar, my attention has been attracted\r\nto the place by a peculiar and nauseous effluvium issuing from the door\r\nindicative of the nature and condition of the inmates.” A main cause of\r\nthis is the filthy external state of the dwellings and defective street\r\ncleansing, and defective supplies of water, which, except that no\r\nprovision is made for laying it on the houses of the poorer classes, is\r\nnow about to be remedied by a superior public provision.\r\n\r\n                                                         Years.  Months.\r\n The average age of the white population living in New     23       3\r\n   York, according to the census, is\r\n But the average age of all who die there is only          20       0\r\n\r\nOr an excess of deaths over the ages of the living of more than three\r\nyears and three months; denoting, if the like excess prevailed from year\r\nto year, an increasing pressure of the causes of mortality. If the\r\nmortality be the same from year to year the chances of life would appear\r\nto be lower in New York than in Dublin, where, according to the data\r\ngiven by the Census Commissioners, it would appear to be 25 years 6\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn America little attention and labour appear to have been bestowed in\r\nany of the rural districts on general land drainage. Yet nature inflicts\r\nterrible punishment for the neglect of the appointed and visible\r\nwarnings and actual premonitory scourges, amongst which are the\r\nmosquitoes and the tribes of insects that only breed in stagnant water\r\nand live in its noxious exhalations. The cleansing and the general\r\nsanitary condition of the American towns appear to be lower than in\r\nEngland or Scotland, whilst the heat there at times is greater and\r\ndecomposition more active; pestilence in the shape of yellow fever,\r\nague, and influenza is there more rife, the deaths in proportion to the\r\npopulation more numerous, and the average age of death (so far as there\r\nis information) amongst the resident population much lower.\r\n\r\n                                                         Years.  Months.\r\n The average age of the whole of the living population\r\n   in America, so far as it can be deduced from the        22       2\r\n   returns at the periods given in the census, is only\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the earlier marriages, and the extent of emigration, and\r\nthe general increase of the population, the whole circumstances appear\r\nto me to prove this to be the case of a population depressed to this low\r\nage chiefly by the greater proportionate pressure of the causes of\r\ndisease and premature mortality. The proportionate numbers at each\r\ninterval of age in every 10,000 of the two populations are as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                 United States of    England and Wales.\r\n                                     America.\r\n         Under 5 years                         1744                 1324\r\n        5 and under 10                         1417                 1197\r\n        10 and under 15                        1210                 1089\r\n        15 and under 20                        1091                  997\r\n        20 and under 30                        1816                 1780\r\n        30 and under 40                        1160                 1289\r\n        40 and under 50                         732                  959\r\n        50 and under 60                         436                  645\r\n        60 and under 70                         245                  440\r\n        70 and under 80                         113                  216\r\n        80 and under 90                          32                   59\r\n        90 and upwards                            4                    5\r\n                                             ——————               ——————\r\n                                             10,000               10,000\r\n\r\n Average age of all the living    22 years 2 months   26 years 7 months.\r\n\r\nHere it may be observed, that whilst in England there are 5025 persons\r\nbetween 15 and 50 who have 3610 children or persons under 15; in America\r\nthere are 4789 persons living between 15 and 50 years of age who have\r\n4371 children dependent upon them. In England there are in every ten\r\nthousand persons 1365 who have obtained above 50 years’ experience; in\r\nAmerica there are only 830.\r\n\r\nThe moral consequences of the predominance of the young and passionate\r\nin the American community are attested by observers to be such as have\r\nalready been described in the General Sanitary Report as characteristic\r\nof those crowded, filthy, and badly administered districts in England\r\nwhere the average duration of life is short, the proportion of the very\r\nyoung great, and the adult generation transient.\r\n\r\nThe difference does not arise solely from the greater proportion of\r\nchildren arising from a greater increase of population, though that is\r\nto some extent consistent with what has been proved to be the effect of\r\na severe general mortality; the effects of the common cause of\r\ndepression is observable at each interval of age: the adult population\r\nin America is younger than in England, and if the causes of early death\r\nwere to remain the same, it may be confidently predicted that the\r\nAmerican population would remain young for centuries.\r\n\r\n                                                         Years.  Months.\r\n The average age of all alive above 15 in America is       33       6\r\n The average age of all alive above 15 years in England    37       5\r\n   and Wales is\r\n The average age of all above 20 years in America is       37       7\r\n In the whole of England the average of all above 20       41       1\r\n   years is\r\n\r\nThe difference at the different stages of age appear also to prevail in\r\nproportion to the different pressure of the causes of disease and\r\nmortality in different districts in England: _e. g._ In the town\r\nparishes of Middlesex the average age of the living above 15 years is 35\r\nyears and 10 months; but in Hereford it is 39 years and 2 months. In\r\nMiddlesex the average age of the adult population, that is of all above\r\n20 years, is 38 years and 8 months; whilst in Hereford it is 42 years\r\nand 1 month.\r\n\r\nThe comparative amount of disease and death elsewhere it need scarcely\r\nbe said, in no way affects the positive amount of evil in this country,\r\nor dispenses with the duty of adopting such practical measures as may be\r\npreventive of a single one of the cases of preventable deaths which\r\nabound in masses in the large districts having the least unfavourable\r\naverages.\r\n\r\nThe instances have been adduced to exemplify the suggestions of\r\namendment in the mode of measuring the amount and influence of\r\nmortality, and more especially to show the importance of giving the\r\naverage age as well as the numbers of deaths and the average age of the\r\nliving in each class of the community.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent district returns and the notes extracted from the reports\r\nmade by the local registrars to the Registrar-General, in corroboration\r\nof the General Sanitary Report, will show the immense importance to the\r\ncommunity of the facts that require investigation. It cannot be too\r\nurgently repeated that it is only by examinations, case by case, and on\r\nthe spot, that the facts from which sound principles may be correctly\r\ndistinguished. They can only be well classed for general conclusions and\r\npublic use by persons who have large numbers brought before their actual\r\nview and consideration, and who have thus brought before them\r\nimpressively the common circumstances for discrimination, which no\r\nhearsay, no ordinary written information will present to their\r\nattention. The attainment of this immensely important public service\r\nmight properly have been submitted as a principal instead of a\r\ncollateral object, to the improvement of the practice of interment, for\r\nthe appointment of such a small well qualified agency as that proposed,\r\n§ 225, of some five or six trustworthy officers of public health for\r\neach million of a town population with the requisite powers and\r\nresponsibilities for ascertaining the actual amount of the preventible\r\ncauses of death, and informing the local officers and the public of what\r\nis to be done for their removal.\r\n\r\nThe districts are placed in the order of the average age of death of the\r\nwhole population during the year 1839, commencing with the highest\r\naverage.\r\n\r\n

Lord Stowell.]\r\n\r\nIn what way the mortal remains are to be conveyed to the grave, and\r\nthere deposited, I do not find any positive rule of law, or of religion,\r\nthat prescribes. The authority under which the received practices exist,\r\nis to be found in our manners, rather than in our laws: they have their\r\norigin in natural sentiments of public decency and private affection;\r\nthey are ratified by common usage and consent; and being attached to a\r\nsubject of the gravest and most impressive nature, remain unaltered by\r\nprivate caprice and fancy, amidst all the giddy revolutions that are\r\nperpetually varying the modes and fashions that belong to the lighter\r\ncircumstances of human life. That bodies should be carried in a state of\r\nnaked exposure to the grave, would be a real offence to the living, as\r\nwell as an apparent indignity to the dead. Some involucra, or coverings,\r\nhave been deemed necessary in all civilized and Christian countries; but\r\nchests or trunks containing the bodies, descending along with them into\r\nthe grave, and remaining there till their own decay, cannot plead either\r\nthe same necessity, or the same general use.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe rule of law which says, that a man has a right to be buried in his\r\nown church-yard, is to be found, most certainly, in many of our\r\nauthoritative text writers; but it is not quite so easy to find the rule\r\nwhich gives him the right of burying a large chest or trunk in company\r\nwith himself. That is no part of his original and absolute right, nor is\r\nit necessarily involved in it. That right, strictly taken, is to be\r\nreturned to his parent earth for dissolution, and to be carried thither\r\nin a decent and inoffensive manner. When these purposes are answered,\r\nhis rights are, perhaps, fully satisfied in the strict sense in which\r\nany claim, in the nature of an absolute right, can be deemed to extend.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been argued, that the ground once given to the body is\r\nappropriated to it for ever; it is literally in mortmain unalienably; it\r\nis not only, the _domus ultima_, but the _domus æterna_, of that tenant,\r\nwho is never to be disturbed, be his condition what it may; the\r\nintroduction of another body into that lodgment at any time, however\r\ndistant, is an unwarrantable intrusion. If these positions be true, it\r\ncertainly follows, that the question of comparative duration sinks into\r\nutter insignificance.\r\n\r\nIn support of them, it seems to be assumed, that the tenant himself is\r\nimperishable; for, surely, there can be no inextinguishable title, no\r\nperpetuity of possession, belonging to a subject which itself is\r\nperishable. But the fact is, that “man” and “for ever” are terms quite\r\nincompatible in any state of his existence, dead or living, in this\r\nworld. The time must come when “_ipsæ periere ruinæ_,” when the\r\nposthumous remains must mingle with, and compose a part of, that soil in\r\nwhich they have been deposited. Precious embalmments, and costly\r\nmonuments may preserve for a long time the remains of those who have\r\nfilled the more commanding stations of human life; but the common lot of\r\nmankind furnishes no such means of conservation. With reference to them,\r\nthe _domus æterna_ is a mere flourish of rhetoric; the process of nature\r\nwill speedily resolve them into an intimate mixture with their kindred\r\ndust; and their dust will help to furnish a place of repose for other\r\noccupants in succession. It is objected, that no precise time can be\r\nfixed at which the mortal remains, and the chest which contains them,\r\nshall undergo the complete process of dissolution, and it certainly\r\ncannot; being dependent upon circumstances that vary, upon difference of\r\nsoils, and exposures of seasons and climates; but observation can\r\nascertain them sufficiently for practical use. The experience of not\r\nmany years is required to furnish a sufficient certainty for such a\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFounded on such facts and considerations, the legal doctrine certainly\r\nis, and has remained, unaffected; that the common cemetery is not _res\r\nunius ætatis_, the property of one generation now departed, but is,\r\nlikewise, the common property of the living, and of generations yet\r\nunborn, and is subject only to temporary appropriations. There exists in\r\nthe whole a right of succession, which can be lawfully obstructed only\r\nin a portion of it, by public authority, that of the ecclesiastical\r\nmagistrate, who gives occasionally an exclusive title, in such portion,\r\nto the succession of some family, or to an individual, who has a fair\r\nclaim to be favoured by such a distinction; and this, not without a just\r\nconsideration of its expedience, and a due attention to the objections\r\nof those who oppose such an alienation from the common property. Even a\r\nbricked grave, granted without such an authority, is an aggression upon\r\nthe common freehold interests, and carries the pretensions of the dead\r\nto an extent that violates the rights of the living.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the matter be just, all contrivances that, whether\r\nintentionally or not, prolong the time of dissolution beyond the period\r\nat which the common local understanding and usage have fixed it, is an\r\nact of injustice, unless compensated in some way or other. In country\r\nparishes, where the population is small, and the cemetery is large, it\r\nis a matter less worthy of consideration; more ground can be spared, and\r\nless is wanted; but, in populous parishes, in large and crowded cities,\r\nthe indulgence of an exclusive possession is unavoidably limited; for,\r\nunless limited, evils of most formidable magnitude take place.\r\nChurchyards cannot be made commensurate to the demands of a large and\r\nincreasing population; the period of decay and dissolution does not\r\narrive fast enough in the accustomed mode of depositing bodies in the\r\nearth, to evacuate the ground for the use of succeeding claimants: new\r\ncemeteries must be purchased at an enormous expense to the parish, and\r\nto be used at an increased expense to families, and at the inconvenience\r\nof their being compelled to resort to very incommodious distances for\r\nattending on the offices of interment.\r\n\r\nIn this very parish three additional burial-grounds are alleged to have\r\nbeen purchased, and to be now nearly filled. This is the progress of\r\nthings in their ordinary course; and if to this is to be added the\r\ngeneral introduction of a new mode of interment, which is to ensure to\r\nbodies a much longer possession, the evil will become intolerable, and a\r\ncomparatively small portion of the dead will shoulder out the living and\r\ntheir posterity. The whole environs of this metropolis will be\r\nsurrounded with a circumvallation of church-yards, perpetually\r\nincreasing, by becoming themselves surcharged with bodies, if indeed\r\nland-owners can be found who will be willing to divert their ground from\r\nthe beneficial uses of the living to the barren preservation of the\r\ndead, contrary to the humane maxim quoted by Tully from Plato’s\r\nRepublic:—“Quæ terra fruges ferre, et, ut mater, cibos, suppeditare\r\npossit, eam ne quis nobis minuat, _neve vivus neve mortuus_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. 13.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VIEW OF THE EXTENT OF INTRA-MURAL BURIAL GROUND PROVIDED, AS COMPARED\r\n    WITH THE QUANTITY REQUIRED FOR THE METROPOLIS, AT THE STANDARD OF\r\n    110 PER ACRE.—Vide Report, § 159, § 160, § 161, § 171.\r\n\r\n  The plan represents the statistical facts and proportions of space\r\n    after the mode used by Mr. Sopwith, the engineer.

Britan., last edit., p. 524.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  The county of Dublin is left out as having a disproportionate amount\r\n  of suburban population.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  The census, which gives not only the description of the houses, but\r\n  the different description of buildings or sizes of farms, shows that\r\n  in both groups of counties they are nearly of the same size, but the\r\n  farms are rather the largest in the best conditioned group. In both\r\n  sets, 93 per cent. of the farms are under 30 acres; upwards of 40 per\r\n  cent. of them from 1 to 5 acres only; 35 per cent. of them from 5 to\r\n  15 acres; 13 per cent. from 15 to 30 acres; and about 7 per cent. only\r\n  above 30 acres; so that the chief differences would apparently be in\r\n  their houses.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  By my colleagues and myself, the uncertainty of the returns of\r\n  commitments, or of convictions, as data to judge of the amount of\r\n  crime committed in any district, was demonstrated in § 1 to § 4 of our\r\n  Report as Commissioners of Inquiry into the condition of the\r\n  Constabulary Force in England and Wales; but that uncertainty attaches\r\n  perhaps in the least degree to the higher classes of crimes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. B. Robinson, the Registrar for West Hackney District, describes\r\n  the condition of the houses where the greatest mortality prevails as\r\n  “bad, with murky superficial gutters within a yard of the front doors.\r\n  Supply of water bad, quite insufficient for health, and that only\r\n  three times a week; cleanliness not prevailing. Shacklewell is, beyond\r\n  doubt, the most healthy village in the district, or, I may say (after\r\n  nearly 30 years’ practice here), within the same distance from London\r\n  (two miles). The only parts of the district that are particularly\r\n  unhealthy are the streets I have named, together with Hartwell street,\r\n  Dalston; but all these require three things only to render them not\r\n  less healthy than the other parts of the neighbourhood: 1. Proper and\r\n  effectual drainage, and removal of superficial drains and gutters. 2.\r\n  A constant supply of water, so as to wash away impurities in the\r\n  drains, and enable the inhabitants to preserve a greater degree of\r\n  cleanliness, &c. 3. That the houses should be kept in better repair,\r\n  and frequently limewashed; and the privies should be more frequently\r\n  emptied, and not allowed to run over; and that any stagnant ditch,\r\n  within a certain distance from houses, should be covered over.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Mr. E. Jay, Registrar of Hanover-square District.—Name any particular\r\n  streets, courts, or houses which, from the number of deaths occurring\r\n  therein, and the nature of the diseases, appear to you to be\r\n  unhealthy.—“I should therefore say that the most unhealthy streets,\r\n  &c., in my district are Oxford-buildings, Brownstreet, Toms-court,\r\n  Thomas-street, Grosvenor-market, Grosvenor-mews, George-street, and\r\n  Hart-street; and to these, perhaps, may be added North-row, and\r\n  Dolphin-court, and Providence-court, also the north end of\r\n  Davies-street, adjoining Oxford-street. I have observed small-pox\r\n  always to exist, when prevalent anywhere, in No. 24, George-street\r\n  (Grosvenor-square); and much sickness and mortality have occurred in\r\n  No. 18, Oxford-buildings. Oxford-buildings consist of 18 inhabited\r\n  houses, containing many wretched families, principally Irish\r\n  labourers; it was improved lately, in consequence of the exertions of\r\n  humane individuals, but is still the seat of great poverty and vice.\r\n  The ventilation here is so bad, that even visiting the houses is a\r\n  disagreeable duty, from the foul air breathed even for a short space\r\n  of time. The supply of water is good, and the drainage is reported by\r\n  those who attend to the subject to be perfect, as it is throughout the\r\n  parish; but the bad effluvia show that there must be some defect in\r\n  this point. Three families frequently live in one room, some of the\r\n  houses containing upwards of 50 persons; many of them live almost\r\n  entirely on potatoes and herrings, and beer when they can get it. Want\r\n  of fuel in many cases in winter. Brown-street.—Occupied by the poor\r\n  and working class; the rooms very small, badly ventilated, and\r\n  cleansed; the damp kitchens, with frequently stone-doors, are lived\r\n  and slept in. Living is bad, from the poverty which prevails here.\r\n  Hart-street.—Many poor families reside here, often in great want.\r\n  Tolerably well drained. Toms-court.—Contains eight houses; inhabitants\r\n  in a wretched state in many cases, partly from want of employ, partly\r\n  from intemperance. Small-pox and epidemics have raged here.\r\n  George-street.—Some of the houses here are inhabited by working men of\r\n  a better class, but it also contains others in a wretched condition,\r\n  in point of cleanliness and ventilation, and much privation is\r\n  suffered by the inhabitants. Grosvenor-market.—This spot is\r\n  particularly close, being built almost in _cul de sac_; the houses are\r\n  dark, badly ventilated, and most unhealthy; the food of some of the\r\n  poorest principally potatoes; a large slaughter-house situated here\r\n  adds to its unhealthiness; great want of fuel in winter.\r\n  Grosvenor-mews.—Here the inhabitants are very thickly crowded, and\r\n  among the children there is always much mortality; in one house, at\r\n  the time of taking the census, there were 80 persons. The inhabitants\r\n  consist of coachmen and their families, as do many of the mews in this\r\n  district. This class is frequently intemperate: they live over\r\n  stables, are ignorant of the necessity of free ventilation, and many\r\n  appear to suffer in consequence. New comers from the country complain\r\n  of the want of free air, to which they ascribe their deteriorated\r\n  health. Thomas-street.—Some of the houses in bad condition, and\r\n  inhabited by the poorest families. No attention to ventilation. Supply\r\n  of butchers’ meat casual and infrequent. Pneumonia and bronchitis are\r\n  frequently fatal in these poorer districts; and he who enters the\r\n  damp, dark, underground kitchen, in which all the occupants live and\r\n  sleep, in which the room is made more close by a fire required for\r\n  their cooking, the atmosphere is loaded with moisture from wet clothes\r\n  hung across the narrow space to dry, and probably some child ill of\r\n  disease, sees that such a state of surrounding circumstances shuts out\r\n  all chance of recovery in at least the majority of cases.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  Mr. G. Pitt, the Registrar of the Rotherhithe District,\r\n  states:—“Hanover-street contains about 35 or 40 houses, in a very old\r\n  and dilapidated state. The houses have generally six or eight rooms\r\n  each, and sometimes as many families of the poorest kind, chiefly\r\n  Irish. As the street has no thoroughfare, and is on an incline of at\r\n  least 10 feet, it is badly drained. The water and filth constantly\r\n  remaining in the street, it is most unhealthy. The same remarks apply\r\n  in all respects to Spread Eagle-court, except that the houses stand\r\n  upon level ground. Norfolk-place and Kenning’s-buildings are exposed\r\n  to the most offensive exhalations of about 150 feet in length of open\r\n  sewer, which receives the filth of the whole surrounding\r\n  neighbourhood. Typhus prevailed here at one time to a most serious\r\n  extent. The persons who occupy the houses above described are\r\n  labourers, with uncertain employment, and their earnings of course\r\n  irregular. Their food of the coarsest kind, with habits by no means\r\n  temperate.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. Stainer, the Registrar of St. Olave District.—In what parts of\r\n  your district has the number of deaths registered in the years 1838,\r\n  1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842 been the greatest, in proportion to the\r\n  population?—“In the densely populated courts and alleys where there\r\n  are open drains and sewers, and the inhabitants are living in dirt,\r\n  stench, and a state of wretchedness to be conceived only by those who\r\n  have witnessed it. Prior to the year 1841 several very unhealthy\r\n  courts existed, in which some of the earliest cases of Asiatic cholera\r\n  occurred on the first appearance of that disease in the metropolis,\r\n  but these have been removed, and the ground now forms the site of the\r\n  termini of the Brighton and other railways. There are large open\r\n  sewers completely stagnant through or near them, the smell from which\r\n  in summer is so dreadful that it is extraordinary how human beings can\r\n  bear it. The supply of water is scanty. The inhabitants are not more\r\n  dirty than might be expected from their circumstances.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Mr. James Pursey, the Registrar of St. Mary, Paddington.—In what parts\r\n  of your district has the greatest number of deaths occurred from\r\n  small-pox, measles, scarlatina, hooping-cough, diarrhœa, dysentery,\r\n  cholera, influenza, or fever (typhus)?—“Kent’s-place, Church-place,\r\n  North-wharf-road, Dudley-street, Green-street.” And state generally\r\n  the condition of those unhealthy streets, courts, and houses, as to\r\n  drainage, supplies of water, cleanliness.—“There being no sewer, the\r\n  drainage is bad. A good supply of water may be had if proper\r\n  receptacles were set up. Filthy condition; Kent’s-place particularly;\r\n  so much so, that the medical officer stated to me that he intended to\r\n  write to the guardians thereupon.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. T. W. C. Perfect, the Registrar of St. Peter’s, Hammersmith.—“All\r\n  that part of the district called Mulberry-hall, consisting of various\r\n  courts and alleys; South-street, in an unfinished state; High-bridge,\r\n  including New-street; Foundry-yard; Trafalgar-street and\r\n  Henrietta-street; the New-road, and all the houses erected, and now\r\n  building in Mr. Scott’s park. Always damp and aguish.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. Larner, the Registrar of the North-west District.—In what parts\r\n  of your district has the greatest number of deaths occurred from\r\n  small-pox, measles, scarlatina, hooping cough, diarrhœa, dysentery,\r\n  cholera, influenza, or fever (typhus)?—“Chelsea Workhouse,\r\n  Leader-street, Oakham street, Little College-street, Arthur-street,\r\n  and Britton-street. The above streets are not supplied with sewers to\r\n  drain the surface, and, consequently, the waste water of the houses is\r\n  carried away by cesspools on the respective premises attached to each\r\n  house. Generally supplied by water being laid on from the Chelsea\r\n  Water-works Company. In general, a want of cleanliness. According to\r\n  the returns on taking the census in 1841, it was found to be the case\r\n  that very many of the houses in the above-mentioned streets (the\r\n  principal of which are only four-roomed houses) contained 10, 12, and\r\n  in some cases more persons; therefore, it may be inferred from those\r\n  returns it oftentimes occurs that three, four, and frequently more,\r\n  sleep in the same rooms in these streets.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Edward Joseph, the Registrar of the Rectory District,\r\n  states:—“Calmell-buildings, to which I allude, is a narrow court,\r\n  being about 22 feet in breadth; the houses are three stories high,\r\n  surrounded and overtopped by the adjacent buildings; the drainage is\r\n  carried on by a common sewer running down the centre of the court, the\r\n  receptacle for slops, &c. from the houses on both sides; the lower\r\n  apartments, especially the kitchens, which are under ground, are damp\r\n  and badly ventilated, light and air being admitted through a grating\r\n  on a level with the court. At all times, but especially so in warm\r\n  weather, a most offensive effluvia is perceptible everywhere. The\r\n  houses are 26 in number, and rented at about 20_l._ to 30_l._ per\r\n  annum; each contains 10 rooms, which the renters of houses let out to\r\n  families or individuals, who in their turn in many instances receive\r\n  as lodgers those who are unable to bear the expenses of a room; by\r\n  such means an immense per centage is added to the original rent.\r\n  According to last year’s census, the number of inhabitants in this\r\n  court was 944, of whom 426 were males, 518 females; of this number,\r\n  118 were children under 7 years of age; 200 from 7 to 20 years; 439\r\n  from 20 to 45; and 189 from 45 years and upwards. The number of\r\n  persons in one house varied from 2 to 70. Males employed, 261;\r\n  females, 163. Total number of the working population 424, leaving 520\r\n  without occupation; the greater part of these were children and old\r\n  persons, dependent upon parochial relief and the assistance of others.\r\n  The following is a statement of the comparative mortality in different\r\n  parts of the houses, as it occurred during the past year:—In the\r\n  kitchens, 1 in 13; parlours, 1 in 37; first floor, 1 in 30; second\r\n  floor, 1 in 33; attics, 1 in 12.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Mr. A. Barnett, the Registrar of the Limehouse District.—In what parts\r\n  of your district has the number of deaths registered in the years\r\n  1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842, been the greatest in proportion to\r\n  the population?—“In those parts of my district in which there exists\r\n  the greatest amount of distress, namely, the want of food, of firing,\r\n  of water, also of cleanliness, both of person and habitation, and, I\r\n  may add, of the district generally: as examples, may be mentioned the\r\n  districts surrounding Jamaica-place, Salmon’s-lane, Eastfield-street,\r\n  Limehouse-causeway, Three-colt-street, and the Tile-yard.” And state\r\n  generally the condition of those unhealthy streets, courts, and\r\n  houses, as to drainage, supplies of water, and cleanliness.—“The\r\n  drainage is frequently altogether wanting, in most cases very\r\n  imperfect; the supply of water insufficient, and want of cleanliness\r\n  very apparent.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. T. Barnes, the Registrar of the Shadwell District.—In what parts\r\n  of your district has the number of deaths registered in the years\r\n  1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842, been the greatest in proportion to\r\n  the population?—“New Gravel-lane, and the several courts and alleys\r\n  communicating therewith, Angel-gardens, New-street, and\r\n  Labour-in-vain-street, Shadwell; Red Lion-street (including the\r\n  workhouse), Upper Well-alley, Cross-alley, and Upper Gun-alley,\r\n  Wapping. The drainage is bad; the supplies of water are insufficient.\r\n  In these parts of the district the density of population is great. In\r\n  many cases a whole family, consisting of seven or eight persons, sleep\r\n  in the same room.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Worrell, the Registrar of the Gray’s Inn-lane District:—“To\r\n  ascertain and compare the healthy with the unhealthy parts of my\r\n  district, I have placed against each street the whole number of deaths\r\n  from all causes during the last five years. I have taken the number of\r\n  deaths from a population of 5000, resident in what I consider healthy\r\n  streets; and I have also taken the number of deaths from a population\r\n  of 5000, resident in streets which I consider unhealthy. The 5000\r\n  occupying the best houses are composed of merchants, professional\r\n  gentlemen, and the richer class of tradesmen; they occupy 728 houses,\r\n  containing about 7800 good rooms; the streets are wide, well drained,\r\n  and have a plentiful supply of water. The 5000 occupying the unhealthy\r\n  streets are composed of the lower class of tradesmen, journeymen\r\n  mechanics, labourers, and costermongers; they occupy 431 houses,\r\n  containing about 2800 rooms, the best of which are little better than\r\n  the worst of the 7800 before mentioned; the streets are mostly\r\n  confined, the drains in a bad state, and in many places the\r\n  accumulation of filth renders the atmosphere foul, whilst the supply\r\n  of water is not very good. The number of deaths which I find in the\r\n  healthy-streets during five years, amongst a population of 5000,\r\n  amounts to 325; and, during the same period, amongst 5000 occupying\r\n  the unhealthy streets I find 613. No doubt, many of the residents in\r\n  the best houses go into the country, with the view of benefiting their\r\n  health, and there die; but certain it is that many more of the poorer\r\n  classes die in the workhouses and hospitals—so that, no doubt, amongst\r\n  a certain number of poor, at least two deaths occur to one amongst the\r\n  same number of rich. Having been a collector of rates upwards of 25\r\n  years, and, as a house agent, having had much to do with the letting\r\n  of houses, I am thoroughly acquainted with the neighbourhood; and,\r\n  having taken an active part in collecting and distributing voluntary\r\n  contributions in times of distress and severe weather, I have been\r\n  enabled to judge of the condition of the poor and their habitations,\r\n  and I have always observed that sickness prevails much more in places\r\n  where sewers and drains are bad than in other parts where the\r\n  inhabitants are equally poor, but have more wholesome houses to live\r\n  in. Any suggestion here as to remedy may, probably, be considered out\r\n  of place, but, having had much experience as a Commissioner of\r\n  Pavements, as well as in several offices of local management during\r\n  the last 25 years, and having given much attention to the subject (an\r\n  evil which, in my opinion, affects the metropolis to an extent little\r\n  imagined), I have no doubt as to the means of remedy, and improvement\r\n  in the local administration living perfectly easy and effectual.”\r\n\r\n  “In another classification he arranges, from descriptions of streets\r\n  with nearly equal population, the highest in each class; the relative\r\n  proportions, and average ages of deaths, are ascertained to be as\r\n  follows:—\r\n\r\n                   Population. Deaths. Average Age of Death.\r\n           Class 1        1432      97                    35\r\n           Class 2        1465     119                    32\r\n           Class 3        1448     157                    25\r\n           Class 4        1386     200                    21\r\n\r\n  “The above statement proves that, out of a population of 1432\r\n  occupying the best houses, 95 deaths occurred within five years, 29 of\r\n  which, at and under five years of age; and that out of a population of\r\n  1386, occupying the worst houses, the whole number of deaths are one\r\n  hundred and eighty-nine, one hundred and four of which at and under\r\n  five years of age.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  Mr. F. Hutchinson, the Registrar of the South District:—State\r\n  generally the condition of those unhealthy streets, courts, and\r\n  houses, as to drainage, supplies of water, cleanliness.—“The drainage\r\n  of all or most of these courts and houses is exceedingly defective.\r\n  About a year ago, for instance, I thought it my duty to complain to\r\n  the local authorities respecting a privy in Hanging-sword-alley, that\r\n  had been full for a great length of time, and could not have been\r\n  used, but for a hole just below the seat, by means of which the fluid\r\n  contents flowed into the open gutter. The effluvia from these houses\r\n  arising from the defective state of the drains is most offensive. In\r\n  some houses there are only cesspools in the cellars, which are emptied\r\n  only once in from six months to three years. Water is supplied from\r\n  the New River three times a-week for about two hours. In many of the\r\n  houses, water-pipes have never been laid down, and in others the\r\n  Company have stopped the supplies, in consequence of non-payment. Some\r\n  of these places, and in particular Plumtree-court, are in a most\r\n  filthy state. Offal, accumulations of dirt, and the refuse of\r\n  vegetables, &c, lying in the gutters. The houses are generally\r\n  remarkable for their dirty and uncomfortable appearance, and are\r\n  mostly without any proper receptacle for dirt and ashes. The\r\n  population is very dense; 15 to 20, and, I am informed, sometimes 30\r\n  persons, inhabiting one house, consisting of six rooms. The general\r\n  condition of the population is very bad, particularly as regards the\r\n  women and children, who are more confined to these localities than the\r\n  men, the latter being generally employed elsewhere during the\r\n  day-time. Many of the persons renting these houses suffer in pocket by\r\n  letting lodgings to parties who never pay; and in health, by thus\r\n  crowding their families, so as to induce disease and infectious\r\n  disorders.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. H. Rich, the Registrar of the Mile End New Town District,\r\n  observes:—“With reference as to the healthy and unhealthy streets in\r\n  my district, I have been carefully through my books, and I cannot\r\n  particularize any one place more than another. The drainage is very\r\n  bad; the hamlet is drained principally by surface drainage, which\r\n  empties itself into a ditch which is uncovered. It runs along the\r\n  north side of the hamlet, which makes it very unwholesome; there has,\r\n  within the last three years, been a sewer made (down High-street and\r\n  Well-street), which has much improved that part of the district. The\r\n  hamlet has been much improved within the last four years as regards\r\n  the paving of several of the streets which were in a most filthy\r\n  state; they are now under the commission. If Luke-street and\r\n  Underwood-street, which contain about 50 houses in each street, were\r\n  paved, it would be a great improvement, and no doubt beneficial to\r\n  health. For want of proper sewerage, the health of the hamlet is\r\n  generally bad.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Mr. N. Bowring, the Registrar of the district Haggerstone West,\r\n  specifies as the seats of the greatest mortality,—“Philips-street,\r\n  Edward-street, Mill-row, Wilmer-gardens, and the upper part of Hoxton\r\n  Old Town (east side), in which the principal diseases are typhus\r\n  fever, consumption, inflammation of the lungs, and scarlatina. Two of\r\n  those places mentioned above, namely, Mill-row and Wilmer-gardens, are\r\n  without drainage; but at the back of the west end of Philips-street,\r\n  south side of Edward-street, and at the back of the upper end of\r\n  Hoxton Old Town, is an open ditch, almost a dead level, in which filth\r\n  of every description is thrown. I believe it is under the management\r\n  of the Commissioners of Sewers, but is seldom cleaned out; the stench\r\n  emitted, particularly in the summer months, is almost intolerable, and\r\n  is considered by the inhabitants as the sole cause of much illness and\r\n  death. Drainage very deficient. Water supplied three times a week. The\r\n  people generally of cleanly habits.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  Mr. George Pearse, the Registrar for the St. John the Evangelist\r\n  District, thus describes the condition of the places in the lower\r\n  districts, where the greatest mortality occurs:—“Great Peter-street,\r\n  Perkin’s rents, Duck-lane, and Old Pye-street, are the most densely\r\n  populated in the district. The houses in Great Peter-street, for the\r\n  most part, are very old, irregular, and uncleanly. Occupied by\r\n  tradesmen and small shopkeepers, together with labourers, mechanics,\r\n  and others of uncertain earnings. The houses in the other three\r\n  streets are often occupied by 10 or 12 persons in one room, most of\r\n  them of the lowest grade in society, such as mendicants, hawkers,\r\n  costermongers, lodging-house-keepers, thieves, and abandoned females\r\n  of irregular and intemperate habits. Their food chiefly consists of\r\n  salt-fish and other scraps, collected by the mendicants and disposed\r\n  of to the general dealers. The houses are, for the most part, very\r\n  low, filthy, and dilapidated, badly drained, and indifferently\r\n  supplied with water. There are other unwholesome nuisances arising\r\n  from the collecting and boiling bones, soap, and tallow, &c.\r\n  Holland-street, Medway-street, Marlborough-place. New Peter-street,\r\n  with several other avenues, surrounding an extensive waste (formerly\r\n  the site of Marlborough square) oftentimes nearly covered with\r\n  stagnant water. The houses are small, very dirty, and dilapidated, low\r\n  in situation, without any drainage, having stagnant waters back and\r\n  front; some in the occupation of the labouring class, and laundresses\r\n  low in the scale, irregular in their earnings and habits. Many cases\r\n  of typhoid fever have occurred here, and several recently.\r\n  Rochester-row, Strutton-ground, and Artillery-square, are thickly\r\n  populated by tradesmen of all kinds and others; they are without\r\n  sewerage or proper drainage; the first having an open ditch through\r\n  the centre for the greater part; and the occupiers of the latter are\r\n  under the necessity of pumping out into the open street (generally at\r\n  night) the offensive water that collects in the cesspools within their\r\n  dwellings. Part of Vauxhall-bridge road, which is contiguous to\r\n  Douglas-street, Bentinck-street and place, with sundry other small\r\n  streets or places communicating with them on the one side, and Upper\r\n  and Lower Garden-street, with Dean’s-place, on the other. The houses\r\n  are small and numerous; inhabited by labourers, laundresses,\r\n  costermongers, and others; without proper drainage, having open\r\n  ditches and stagnant waters in their vicinity. Typhus and scarlatina\r\n  have been frequent here, and several deaths therefrom have occurred\r\n  within the last few weeks. In Causton-street the houses are small,\r\n  populous, with courts or places occupied by labourers generally, and\r\n  an open ditch in front. Ship-court, with Cottage-place, is situated\r\n  very low; composed of small, ill-ventilated, dirty, dilapidated\r\n  houses; thickly inhabited by labourers and others of very low and\r\n  irregular earnings and habits; adjoining several large dilapidated\r\n  premises, with extensive wastes or yards used as pig and cow-yards, or\r\n  for the purpose of collecting slop-soil and other filth, left\r\n  evaporating in the open air, without sewerage or proper drainage.\r\n  Vine-street, with Champion’s-alley, York-buildings in Grub-street, on\r\n  one side, and Scott’s-rents on the other, for the most part are small\r\n  old houses, peopled by the labouring classes, with bad drainage, and\r\n  the wharfs in Millbank-street, for the deposit of slop-soil and other\r\n  nuisance.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Verrall, the Registrar of the St. John’s District.—“The\r\n  following places appear to me to be unhealthy from the absence of all\r\n  habit of cleanliness in most of the inhabitants; the want of drainage;\r\n  the ruinous condition of the houses; the number of lay-stalls, in\r\n  which filth of all kinds is accumulated, and the number of pigs kept\r\n  in the neighbourhood,—King-street, Queen-street, Gold-street,\r\n  Ship-street, Hilliard’s court, and Pruson’s island. In the following\r\n  places (in addition to the foregoing) the houses appear unhealthily\r\n  crowded and very dirty, with inadequate means of ventilation, namely,\r\n  Church’s-gardens, New-court, Crown-place, Miner-court, Macord’s-rents,\r\n  Ellis-court, Petrie-court, Hampton-court, Rycroft’s-court, and\r\n  Matthew’s-court.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Mr. George Lee, the Registrar of the St. Giles’ South District reports\r\n  generally, as to the condition of the worst parts of the district,\r\n  that they are characterized by insufficient drainage, indifferent\r\n  supply of water, cleanliness neglected.\r\n\r\n  Mr. John Yardley, Registrar of St. George, Bloomsbury District.—“They\r\n  are places without a thoroughfare to (two of them are built many feet\r\n  below the surface of the street adjoining), and surrounded with houses\r\n  of much greater height.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Mr. W. Fitch, the Registrar of the St. Clement Danes’ District,\r\n  describes the houses of the lower classes as excessively crowded.—“The\r\n  number of persons sleeping in the same rooms are generally the whole\r\n  family, from two to six persons, and often more. I beg to observe,\r\n  that where persons occupy different rooms in one house they are\r\n  generally very particular in keeping the doors of their rooms closed\r\n  for the purpose of preventing others passing up and down stairs\r\n  overlooking their abode, thereby causing a very great check to\r\n  ventilation. Washing clothes, and placing them to dry in the rooms\r\n  during the night, is another inconvenience the wretchedly poor are\r\n  labouring under in many parts of my district, and this to a great\r\n  extent.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. Mears, Registrar of Waterloo-road, No. 1 District.—In what\r\n  parts of your district has the number of deaths registered in the\r\n  years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842 been the greatest in proportion\r\n  to the population?—“In the undermentioned parts:—Whitehorse-street,\r\n  Wootton-street, Windmill-street, Windmill-row, Little Windmill-street,\r\n  and courts, Isabella-place, Broadwall, Cornwall-road and place,\r\n  Cottage-place, Commercial road, Bond-place and Commercial-buildings,\r\n  Princes court, Eaton-street, Brad-street, Roupell-street, New-street,\r\n  Mitre-place, John-street, Salutation-place.” And state generally the\r\n  condition of those unhealthy streets, courts, and houses, as to\r\n  drainage, supplies of water, cleanliness.—“In the above places there\r\n  is very imperfect drainage; very few have any communication with the\r\n  sewers. The houses have cesspools, and the water runs to waste and\r\n  settles on the surface, leaving the lower parts of the houses damp.\r\n  Supplies of water tolerably good; cleanliness, indifferent.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Green, Registrar of Waterloo-road, No. 2.—In what parts of your\r\n  district has the greatest number of deaths occurred from small-pox,\r\n  measles, scarlatina, hooping-cough, diarrhœa, dysentery, cholera,\r\n  influenza, or fever (typhus)?—“Juston-street, Hooper-street,\r\n  Whiting-street, Apollo-buildings, courts and streets adjacent,\r\n  Charles-street, Harriot-street, Frazier-street, Lucretia-street, James\r\n  street, Barnes-terrace, Granby-place and Granby-gardens, Burdett\r\n  street, Francis street.” And state generally the condition of those\r\n  unhealthy streets, courts, and houses, as to drainage, supplies of\r\n  water, cleanliness.—“In the above-named streets the drainage is very\r\n  imperfect, and much filthy water is thrown often into the streets. A\r\n  plentiful supply of water. Many pay but little attention to\r\n  cleanliness. Densely populated. In many houses from four to eight or\r\n  nine in one room.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  Mr. R. Bell, the Registrar of the Kent-road District:—In what parts or\r\n  your district has the number of deaths registered in the years 1838,\r\n  1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842 been the greatest in proportion to the\r\n  population?—“There are many close, filthy courts in this district; in\r\n  these, the deaths are uniformly the highest; and the local\r\n  registration does not correctly show this fact, for the people\r\n  inhabiting them are very poor, and in extreme illness are often\r\n  removed either to the workhouse or the hospitals, and they die in\r\n  those places.” And state generally the condition of those unhealthy\r\n  streets, courts, and houses as to drainage, supplies of water,\r\n  cleanliness.—“Drainage,—open gutters choked, and pits of stagnant\r\n  water. Supplies of water—good supply from water works. Cleanliness—as\r\n  a general rule they seldom attend to this, unless they expect a visit\r\n  from the medical or other officers: they excuse it by stating that\r\n  they have to work for their living. The people live very close in\r\n  small rooms; have often more than one bed in a room. Beds are made of\r\n  straw and shavings to sleep on, and a great number sleep on the floor;\r\n  from three to ten persons in a room; almost every room is a\r\n  sleeping-room.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Bedwell, the Registrar of the Borough-road District;—In what\r\n  parts of your district has the number of deaths registered in the\r\n  years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842 been the greatest in proportion\r\n  to the population?—“My district, formerly nearly a square, bounded on\r\n  the west by about 50 houses in Blackfriars-road; on the south, by\r\n  about 70, in the Borough road; on the east, by about the same number\r\n  in Blackman-street, and partly on the north by Wellington-street; I\r\n  find the greatest number of deaths in proportion to the population in\r\n  the small streets within the above quadrangle. Drainage very\r\n  deficient; supply of water plentiful; cleanliness little attended to\r\n  by a great number. The density of population extreme. Small houses\r\n  with a family in each room. We have lodging-houses in the Mint where\r\n  from 50 to 150 sleep nightly; 10 large beds in one room in some of\r\n  them.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Paul, the Registrar of St. James’s District.—In what parts of\r\n  your district has the greatest number of deaths occurred from\r\n  small-pox, measles, scarlatina, hooping-cough, diarrhœa, dysentery,\r\n  cholera, influenza, or fever (typhus)? And in what parts have epidemic\r\n  diseases been most fatal?—“I do not know. Neither small-pox,\r\n  scarlatina, measles, whooping-cough, diarrhœa, nor influenza has been\r\n  peculiarly localized. My experience of a longer date as surgeon to the\r\n  poor of the district leads me to believe that cholera, dysentery, and\r\n  typhus fever have been more prevalent in London-street and its\r\n  vicinity, and the Tar-yard. In both these places drainage is bad; and\r\n  the inhabitants of the former locality obtain their supply of water\r\n  from a running ditch—a common receptacle for everything, where a\r\n  hundred cloacina empty themselves. Drainage is bad in many parts of\r\n  the district; lots of small houses are built; streets of a better\r\n  description unfinished; their proprietors, who look only to the cash\r\n  returns, pay little attention to the drainage or cleanliness. There\r\n  appears to be no remedy for these calamities. The supply of water is\r\n  now pretty good.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  Mr. George Reynolds, the Registrar of the Church District, in answer\r\n  to the question, In what parts of your district has the number of\r\n  deaths registered in the years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842 been\r\n  the greatest in proportion to the population? states. “In\r\n  Beckford-row, Elliot-row, Alfred-place, Camden-gardens, Pitt-street,\r\n  Pott-street, Camden-street, Wolverley-street, New York-street, and\r\n  Ponderson-gardens.” And state generally the condition of those\r\n  unhealthy streets, courts, and houses, as to drainage, supplies of\r\n  water, cleanliness.—“The places I have named are entirely without\r\n  drainage. Supply of water, one hand-cock to many houses. Cleanliness,\r\n  great want of.” Name any particular streets or parts which, according\r\n  to the facts that have fallen under your notice, appear to you to be\r\n  healthy, and with reference to the points adverted to in the preceding\r\n  question, compare the healthy with the unhealthy portions of your\r\n  district.—“My entire district, I think, would be in a much more\r\n  healthy condition had we efficient drainage; instead of which, even\r\n  this, the main road of the parish, is without a sewer, notwithstanding\r\n  the Commissioners of Sewers have been repeatedly memorialized, and the\r\n  following fact brought under their notice, that the cellars of the\r\n  houses do not extend to the depth of 3 feet 6 inches below the level\r\n  of the carriage-road, and yet there is an average of 18 inches of\r\n  water during the greater part of the winter season, that many persons\r\n  are obliged to use the pump for many hours daily to preserve their\r\n  property.” He gives the following letter from a medical officer of\r\n  great experience:—\r\n\r\n                         “289, Bethnal-green-road, October 31st, 1842.\r\n\r\n    “Dear Reynolds,—As you are aware, I have attended many of the\r\n    inhabitants of this road and its vicinity, and I do not hesitate\r\n    to say that many of their diseases are to be attributed entirely\r\n    to the want of drainage. They are—1st, febrile diseases; 2nd,\r\n    diseases of the respiratory organs; 3rd, nervous diseases; 4th,\r\n    diseases of the digestive organs; and lastly, cachectic diseases.\r\n    Of the first kind, the very numerous cases of fever in the\r\n    undrained districts that occur shortly after the autumnal rains, I\r\n    take in the light of cause and effect. Rheumatism (acute and\r\n    chronic) are the result of sleeping in houses the walls of which\r\n    absorb the surface water and elevate it by capillary attraction to\r\n    the height of two or three feet. The diseases of the respiratory\r\n    and digestive organs are above the average number, and are\r\n    attributable to the same cause. The nervous diseases I attribute\r\n    to the poisonous gases exhaled from putrifying matter. They\r\n    are—1st, epilepsy. In two families this disease attacked every one\r\n    of the younger branches of the family, and they were cured by\r\n    removal to another district. Many cases of spasm of a particular\r\n    muscle, as one or two of the muscles of the face, the large muscle\r\n    in front of the neck, and even some of the muscles of the arm;\r\n    also frequent cases of the most inveterate hysteria, have been\r\n    temporarily relieved by removal, and have returned again on their\r\n    return home. Of the cachectic diseases, some are produced, others\r\n    aggravated, by this cause. Scrofula is of this latter description.\r\n    The cases of the children in your own family show that it is\r\n    impossible to prevent suppuration when the patient is constantly\r\n    breathing a humid atmosphere. This has also been the case with one\r\n    of your immediate neighbours. That form of scrofula termed tabes\r\n    mesenterica, I think, is, in many cases, brought on entirely by\r\n    the same cause. Want of time prevents my extending the example of\r\n    diseases attributable to this cause.\r\n\r\n                  “I am, dear Reynolds, yours truly,      “T. TAYLOR.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. James Murray, the Registrar of the Hackney-road District, in\r\n  answer to the question, In what parts of your district, has the number\r\n  of deaths registered in the years 1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, and 1842\r\n  been the greatest, in proportion to the population? states, “The\r\n  greatest number of deaths registered, in proportion to the population,\r\n  have occurred in all the streets leading into Old Cock-lane,\r\n  especially the courts therein, and in all the streets leading into the\r\n  Hackney-road as far as Strout’s-place, viz., Old Nichol-street, New\r\n  Nichol-street, Half Nichol-street, Vincent-street, Mead-street,\r\n  Turville-street, and courts therein, Collingwood street, Old\r\n  Castle-street, Virginia-row, Austin-street, Gascoigne-place, and\r\n  Weatherhead, Nova Scotia, Green Gate, and Cooper’s-gardens, and\r\n  Wellington-row.” In what parts of your district has the greatest\r\n  number of deaths occurred from small-pox, measles, scarlatina,\r\n  hooping-cough, diarrhœa, dysentery, cholera, influenza, or fever\r\n  (typhus)?—“The greatest number of deaths from the diseases named have\r\n  occurred in precisely the same parts of my district, especially in the\r\n  courts and in those anomalous assemblages of small cabins built on low\r\n  and undrained ground, called gardens.” And in what parts have epidemic\r\n  diseases been most fatal?\r\n\r\n  “Epidemic diseases have been most fatal wherever the greatest number\r\n  of people are congregated on the smallest space, which is again the\r\n  identical spot mentioned above, with the exception of Wellington-row\r\n  and the gardens, where the deaths appear to be chiefly caused by their\r\n  low, damp, and almost swampy condition during winter. Pneumonia being\r\n  there the prevailing cause of death, with occasional instances of\r\n  putrid sore throat.” And state generally the condition of those\r\n  unhealthy streets, courts, and houses, as to drainage, supplies of\r\n  water, cleanliness.—“These streets and courts have generally an\r\n  imperfect drainage, suitable only to a former state. These drains are\r\n  very near the surface; and some of the houses are built over them, so\r\n  as to communicate a dampness prejudicial to health. The gardens herein\r\n  mentioned appear to be entirely without drainage. The supply of water\r\n  in the streets is generally good, but in the courts and in the gardens\r\n  is derived from a main, to the cock of which the inhabitants have\r\n  common access while the water is on, and have to fetch it in pails to\r\n  their houses, which mode of supply I consider to be insufficient for\r\n  health or cleanliness. The population is very dense, in some cases\r\n  amounting to nearly 30 persons in a single house. As an average, an\r\n  enumeration district may be taken, 57 houses, 580 persons. On taking\r\n  in a larger district, 30,000 people congregated on a spot about half a\r\n  mile square. The houses are universally let out in rooms, a custom\r\n  apparently introduced by the French refugees; the houses built by whom\r\n  are all on the Edinburgh Old Town or French fashion, with large rooms\r\n  on each floor, intended for a family, with a common staircase. A\r\n  single room now generally contains a family, with tools of trade, bed,\r\n  and kitchen, which, coupled with uncleanly habits, occasions a\r\n  constant effluvium, very oppressive, and, I doubt not, unhealthy. In\r\n  the larger houses, the lowest grade live in damp under-ground\r\n  kitchens.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  The Average for the previous six Years was £405.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  Increase of 1840, from two tablets.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Extra-Parochial.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Private.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Collegiate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Private.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  Private.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LONDON:\r\n          Printed by WILLIAM CLOWES and SONS, Stamford-street.\r\n                  For Her Majesty’s Stationery Office.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
