This plan has proved so successful in my later life that I\r\nfeel emboldened to offer it for the consideration of speakers and\r\nsingers.\r\n\r\nWhile twenty-five years ago few of the principles here described were\r\nacknowledged or even recognized, within the last decade almost all\r\nhave been advocated separately by different teachers or writers. At\r\nthe present time, therefore, originality consists only in the\r\nclassification of the principles into a systematic, progressive whole,\r\nand in arranging a simpler and more practical method of applying them,\r\nthus making the desired results much more quickly attainable.\r\n\r\nIt is attempted in this volume only to describe the value of each\r\nelement in the production of the perfect tone and to demonstrate the\r\nprinciples which, if properly and faithfully applied, will develop the\r\nbest that is possible in each individual voice and prepare the pupil\r\nto enter upon the more advanced arts of speaking and singing.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 I prepared a series of papers on _The Art of Vocalism_, which\r\nwere published in _The Étude_ in May, June, and July of that year.\r\nThese articles are incorporated in this work. In connection with\r\ndifferent organs and conditions, important principles are stated and\r\nrestated. This repetition is thought desirable in order that the\r\nfundamentals may be kept prominently before the mind and impressed\r\nupon the attention.\r\n\r\nI believe that a careful study of this volume will prove of essential\r\nservice to teachers and advanced pupils of singing and oratory,\r\nespecially to young teachers just entering upon their duties. Its\r\nmethod will be found adapted to the instruction of pupils of all\r\ngrades, from the kindergarten to the Conservatory of Music and the\r\nSchool of Oratory.\r\n\r\nI shall be gratified if this outcome of years of experience, constant\r\nstudy, and tested methods shall prove helpful to those who seek\r\nmastery of the art of beautiful speaking and singing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [signature] Thomas Fillebrown]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n      PREFACE                                            vii\r\n\r\n      INTRODUCTION                                         1\r\n\r\n   I.

At middle life I had given up all attempt at\r\nsinging and had difficulty in speaking so as to be heard at any\r\nconsiderable distance or for any considerable length of time.\r\nProfessional obligations to my patients, however, compelled me later\r\nto take up the subject of vocal physiology. This I did, guided by the\r\nideas current on the subject.\r\n\r\nAbout 1880 I became satisfied that many of the current ideas were\r\nincorrect, and determined to start anew, and to note in detail the\r\naction of each organ used in vocalization and articulation. To this\r\nend I sought vocal instruction and advice, which, modified by my own\r\nobservations, have produced the most gratifying results.\r\n\r\nUp to that time it had been held that the nasal cavities must be cut\r\noff from the mouth by the closing of the soft palate against the back\r\nof the throat; that the passage of ever so little of the sound above\r\nthe palate would give a nasal twang, and that the sound was reinforced\r\nand developed only in the cavities of the throat and mouth. My\r\npractice in Oral Surgery, coupled with my own vocal studies exposed\r\nthis fallacy and revealed to me the true value of nasal resonance.\r\n\r\nThe late Mme. Rudersdorff had begun to recognize the effect of nasal\r\nresonance, but she left no published record of her conclusions. It\r\ndoes not appear that she or her contemporaries realized the true value\r\nof the nasal and head cavities as reinforcing agents in the production\r\nof tone, or appreciated their influence upon its quality and power.\r\n\r\nThere are perhaps few subjects on which a greater variety of opinion\r\nexists than on that of voice culture, and few upon which so many\r\nvolumes have been written. Few points are uncontested, and exactly\r\nopposite statements are made in regard to each.\r\n\r\nFormerly great stress was laid upon the distinction between \"head\r\ntones\" and \"chest tones,\" \"closed tones\" and \"open tones.\" The whole\r\nmusical world was in bondage to \"registers of the voice,\" and the one\r\ngreat task confronting the singer and vocal teacher was to \"blend the\r\nregisters,\" a feat still baffling the efforts of many instructors.\r\n\r\nMany teachers and singers have now reached what they consider a\r\ndemonstrated conclusion that registers are not a natural feature of\r\nthe voice; yet a large contingent still adhere to the doctrine of\r\n\"register,\" depending for their justification upon the unreliable\r\nevidence furnished by the laryngoscope, not realizing that there will\r\nbe found in the little lens as many different conditions as the\r\nobservers have eyes to see. Garcia himself, the inventor of the\r\nlaryngoscope, soon modified his first claims as to its value in vocal\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nOn this point we have the testimony of his biographer, M.S. McKinley:\r\n\r\n\"As far as Garcia was concerned, the laryngoscope ceased to be of any\r\nspecial use as soon as his first investigations were concluded. By his\r\nexamination of the glottis he had the satisfaction of proving that all\r\nhis theories with regard to the emission of the voice were absolutely\r\ncorrect. Beyond that he did not see that anything further was to be\r\ngained except to satisfy the curiosity of those who might be\r\ninterested in seeing for themselves the forms and changes which the\r\ninside of the larynx assumed during singing and speaking.\"\r\n\r\nOf similar purport is the word of the eminent baritone, Sir Charles\r\nSantley, who, in his _Art of Singing_, says:\r\n\r\n\"Manuel Garcia is held up as the pioneer of scientific teaching of\r\nsinging. He was--but he taught singing, not surgery! I was a pupil of\r\nhis in 1858 and a friend of his while he lived;[1] and in all the\r\nconversations I had with him I never heard him say a word about larynx\r\nor pharynx, glottis or any other organ used in the production and\r\nemission of the voice. He was perfectly acquainted with their\r\nfunctions, but he used his knowledge for his own direction, not to\r\nparade it before his pupils.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Garcia died July 1, 1906, at the age of 101.]\r\n\r\nThe eminent London surgeon and voice specialist, Dr. Morell Mackenzie,\r\nsays of the laryngoscope, \"It can scarcely be said to have thrown any\r\nnew light on the mechanism of the voice\"; and Dr. Lennox Browne\r\nconfesses that, \"Valuable as has been the laryngoscope in a\r\nphysiological, as undoubtedly it is in a medical sense, it has been\r\nthe means of making all theories of voice production too dependent on\r\nthe vocal cords, and thus the importance of the other parts of the\r\nvocal apparatus has been overlooked.\"\r\n\r\nNot only in regard to \"registers\" but in regard to resonance, focus,\r\narticulation, and the offices and uses of the various vocal organs,\r\nsimilar antagonistic opinions exist. Out of this chaos must some time\r\ncome a demonstrable system.\r\n\r\nA generation ago the art of breathing was beginning to be more an\r\nobject of study, but the true value of correct lateral abdominal\r\nbreathing was by no means generally admitted or appreciated. It was\r\nstill taught that the larynx (voice-box) should bob up and down like a\r\njack-in-a-box with each change of pitch, and that \"female breathing\"\r\nmust be performed with a pumping action of the chest and the\r\nelevation and depression of the collar bone.\r\n\r\nFortunately, teachers and singers recognized a good tone when they\r\nheard it, and many taught much better than they knew, so that the\r\npublic did not have to wait for the development of accurate knowledge\r\nof the subject before hearing excellent singing and speaking. Yet many\r\nsingers had their voices ruined in the training, and their success as\r\nvocalists made impossible; while others, a little less unfortunate,\r\nwere still handicapped through life by the injury done by mistaken\r\nmethods in early years. Jenny Lind's perfect vocal organs were quite\r\ndisabled at twelve years of age by wrong methods, and they recovered\r\nonly after a protracted season of rest. As a consequence her beautiful\r\nvoice began to fail long before her splendid physique, and long before\r\nher years demanded. Singers taught in nature's way should be able to\r\nsing so long as strength lasts, and, like Adelaide Phillips, Carl\r\nFormes, and Sims Reeves, sing their sweetest songs in the declining\r\nyears of life. Martel, at seventy years of age, had a full, rich\r\nvoice. He focused all his tones alike, and employed deep abdominal\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter of voice training has been clouded by controversy.\r\nThe strident advocates of various systems, each of them \"the only true\r\nmethod,\" have in their disputes overcast the subject with much that is\r\nirrelevant, thus obscuring its essential simplicity.\r\n\r\nThe \"scientific\" teachers, at one extreme, have paid too exclusive\r\nattention to the mechanics of the voice. The \"empiricists\" have gone\r\nto the other extreme in leaving out of account fundamental facts in\r\nacoustics, physiology, and psychology.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that no purely human function, especially one so subtle\r\nas singing, can be developed mechanically; nor, on the other hand, can\r\nthe mere _ipse dixit_ of any teacher satisfy the demands of the modern\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES ADVOCATED\r\n\r\nThe positions here advocated, because they seem both rational and\r\nsimple, are:\r\n\r\n=1. That the singing and speaking tones are identical, produced by the\r\nsame organs in the same way, and developed by the same training.=\r\n\r\n=2. That breathing is, for the singer, only an amplification of the\r\ncorrect daily habit.=\r\n\r\n=3. That \"registers\" are a myth.=\r\n\r\n=4. That \"head tones, chest tones, closed tones, open tones,\" etc., as\r\nconfined to special parts of the range of the voice, are distracting\r\ndistinctions arising from false education.=\r\n\r\n=5. That resonance determines the quality and carrying power of every\r\ntone, and is therefore the most important element in the study and\r\ntraining of the voice.=\r\n\r\n=6. That the obstacles to good speaking and singing are psychologic\r\nrather than physiologic.=\r\n\r\n=7. That, in the nature of things, the right way is always an easy\r\nway.=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE VOCAL INSTRUMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the vocal organism first became an object of systematic study,\r\ndiscussion has been constant as to whether the human vocal instrument\r\nis a stringed instrument, a reed instrument, or a whistle. Discussion\r\nof the question seems futile, for practically it is all of these and\r\nmore. The human vocal organs form an instrument, _sui generis_, which\r\ncannot be compared with any other one thing. Not only is it far more\r\ncomplex than any other instrument, being capable, as it is, of\r\nimitating nearly every instrument in the catalogue and almost every\r\nsound in nature, but it is incomparably more beautiful, an instrument\r\nso universally superior to any made by man that comparisons and\r\ndefinitions fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS\r\n\r\nThe human vocal instrument has the three elements common to all\r\nmusical instruments,--a motor, a vibrator, and a resonator; to which\r\nis added--what all other instruments lack--an articulator.\r\n\r\n1. The respiratory muscles and lungs for a =motor=.\r\n\r\n2. The vocal cords for a =vibrator=.\r\n\r\n3. The throat, mouth, and the nasal and head cavities for a =resonator=.\r\n\r\n4. The tongue, lips, teeth, and palate for an =articulator=.\r\n\r\nThese elements appear in as great a variety of size and proportion as\r\ndo the variations of individual humanity, and each element is,\r\nmoreover, variable according to the will or feeling of the individual.\r\nThis susceptibility to change constitutes a modifying power which\r\ngives a variety in tone quality possible to no other instrument and\r\nmakes it our wonder and admiration. The modification and interaction\r\nof these various parts produced by the emotions of the singer or\r\nspeaker give qualities of tone expressive of the feelings, as of pain\r\nor pleasure, grief or joy, courage or fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Section of the head and throat locating the\r\norgans of speech and song, including the upper resonators. The\r\nimportant maxillary sinus cannot well be shown. It is found within the\r\nmaxillary bone (cheek bone). The inner end of the line marked _Nasal\r\ncavity_ locates it.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBRE\r\n\r\nThe minute differences in these physical conditions, coupled with the\r\nsubtler differences in the psychical elements of the personality,\r\naccount for that distinctive physiognomy of the voice called =timbre=,\r\nwhich is only another name for individuality as exhibited in each\r\nperson. The same general elements enter into the composition of all\r\nvoices, from the basso profundo to the high soprano.\r\n\r\nThat the reader may better understand the proportion and relations of\r\nthe different parts of the vocal apparatus, a sectional drawing of the\r\nhead is here produced, showing the natural position of the vocal\r\norgans at rest. As the drawing represents but a vertical section of\r\nthe head the reader should note that the sinuses, like the eyes and\r\nnostrils, lie in pairs to the right and left of the centre of the\r\nface. The location of the maxillary sinuses within the maxillary or\r\ncheek bones cannot be shown in this drawing.\r\n\r\nThe dark shading represents the cavities of the throat, nose, and\r\nhead. The relations of the parts are shown more accurately than is\r\npossible in any diagram. It will be noticed that the vibrations from\r\nthe larynx would pass directly behind the soft palate into the nasal\r\nchamber, and very directly into the mouth. The nasal roof is formed by\r\ntwo bones situated between the eyes; the sphenoid or wedge-bone, which\r\nis connected with all other bones of the head, and the ethmoid or\r\nsieve-like bone. The structure of these two bones, especially of the\r\nethmoid, consists of very thin plates or laminæ, forming a mass of air\r\ncavities which communicate by small openings with the nasal cavity\r\nbelow. Thus, the vibrations in the nose are transmitted to the air\r\nspaces above, and the effective qualities of the head vibrations are\r\nadded to the tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe larynx or voice-box contains the vocal cords. Just above the vocal\r\ncords on each side is a large, deep cavity, called the ventricle.\r\nThese cavities reinforce the primary vibrations set up by the cords\r\nand serve to increase their intensity as they are projected from the\r\nlarynx. The larynx is the vibrating organ of the voice. It is situated\r\nat the base of the tongue and is so closely connected with it by\r\nattachment to the hyoid bone, to which the tongue is also attached,\r\nthat it is capable of only slight movement independent of that organ;\r\nconsequently it must move with the tongue in articulation. The\r\ninterior muscles of the larynx vary the position of its walls, thus\r\nregulating the proximity and tension of the vocal cords. The male\r\nlarynx is the larger and shows the Adam's apple. In both sexes the\r\nlarynx of the low voice, alto or bass, is larger than that of the high\r\nvoice, soprano or tenor. The larynx and tongue should not rise with\r\nthe pitch of the voice, but drop naturally with the lower jaw as the\r\nmouth opens in ascending the scale. The proper position of the tongue\r\nwill insure a proper position for the larynx. The less attention the\r\nlarynx receives the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOCAL CORDS\r\n\r\nThe vocal cords are neither cords nor bands, but instead are thick\r\nportions of membrane extending across the inner surface of the larynx.\r\nOn account of familiarity the name _vocal cords_ will still be used.\r\nThey are fairly well represented by the lips of the cornet player when\r\nplaced on the mouthpiece of the instrument. The pitch of the tone is\r\nfixed by the tension of the vocal cords and the width and length of\r\nthe opening between them. Their tension and proximity are\r\nself-adjusted to produce the proper pitch without any conscious\r\nvolition of the singer. They can have no special training, needing\r\nonly to be left alone. The work of the vocal cords, though essentially\r\nimportant, is, when naturally performed, light and consequently not\r\nexhausting. If the larynx and all of its supporting muscles are\r\nrelaxed as they are in free and easy breathing, then when the air\r\npasses out through the larynx, the vocal cords will automatically\r\nassume a tension sufficient to vocalize the breath and give the note\r\nthe proper pitch. The normal action of the cords will never cause\r\nhoarseness or discomfort. The sound should seem to be formed, not in\r\nthe throat,--thus involving the vocal cords,--but in the resonance\r\nchambers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EPIGLOTTIS\r\n\r\nThe epiglottis is the valve which closes over the upper opening of the\r\nlarynx. It not only closes the mouth of the larynx when food is\r\nswallowed, but aids materially in converting into tone the vibrations\r\nset up by the vocal cords.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHARYNX\r\n\r\nThe pharynx extends from the larynx to the nasal cavity. The size of\r\nthe opening into the nasal chamber is controlled by the soft palate\r\nand is frequently entirely closed. The size of the pharynx is varied\r\nby the contraction and relaxation of the circular muscles in its\r\ntissue; when swallowing its walls are in contact. The pharynx acts as\r\ndoes the expanding tube of brass instruments. It increases the force\r\nand depth of the tone waves. The wider the pharynx is opened, without\r\nconstraint, the fuller the resonance and the better the tone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDER JAW\r\n\r\nThe under jaw furnishes attachment for the muscles of the tongue and\r\nhyoid or tongue bone. It also controls, owing to the connections of\r\nthe larynx with the hyoid bone, the muscles that fix the position of\r\nthe larynx.\r\n\r\nThe pterygoid muscles, which move the under jaw forward and backward,\r\ndo not connect with the larynx, so their action does not compress that\r\norgan or in any way impede the action of the vocal apparatus. A\r\nrelaxed under jaw allows freer action of the vocal cords and ampler\r\nresonance. The under jaw should drop little by little as the voice\r\nascends the scale, thus opening the mouth slightly wider with each\r\nrise in the pitch of the tone. In ascending the scale it is well to\r\nopen the throat a little wider as you ascend. The delivery will be\r\nmuch easier, and the tone produced will be much better. At the highest\r\npitch of the voice the mouth should open to its full width. At the\r\nsame time care must be taken _not_ to draw the corners of the mouth\r\nback, as in smiling, because this lessens the resonance of the tone\r\nand gives it a flat sound.\r\n\r\nThe under jaw must have considerable latitude of motion in\r\npronunciation, but by all means avoid chewing of the words and cutting\r\noff words by closing the jaw instead of finishing them by the use of\r\nthe proper articulating organs, which are the tongue and lips.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOFT PALATE\r\n\r\nWriters on the voice have almost universally claimed that the\r\nprincipal office of the soft palate is to shut off the nasal and head\r\ncavities from the throat, and to force the column of vibrations out\r\nthrough the mouth, thus allowing none, or at most a very small part,\r\nto pass into the nasal passages.\r\n\r\nThis contention implies that the vibrations are imparted to the upper\r\ncavities, if at all, through the walls of the palate itself, and not\r\nthrough an opening behind the palate. This is entirely at variance\r\nwith the facts as verified by my own experience and observation and\r\nthe observation of others who are expert specialists. The true office\r\nof the soft palate is to modify the opening into the nose and thus\r\nattune the resonant cavities to the pitch and timbre of the note given\r\nby the vocal cords and pharynx. To develop the vowel sounds, the soft\r\npalate should be drawn forward, allowing a free passage into the nose;\r\nit should be closed only to form the consonants which require a\r\nforcible expulsion of breath from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe uvula, the pendulous tip of the soft palate, serves as a valve to\r\nmore accurately adjust the opening behind the soft palate to the pitch\r\nof the voice. In producing a low tone the soft palate is relaxed and\r\nhangs low down and far forward. As the voice ascends the scale the\r\ntension of the soft palate is increased and it is elevated and the\r\nuvula shortened, thus decreasing the opening behind the palate, but\r\nnever closing it. In fact the larger the opening that can be\r\nmaintained, the broader and better the tone. The author was himself\r\nunable fully to appreciate this until he had become able to sense the\r\nposition of the soft palate during vocalization.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARD PALATE AND TEETH\r\n\r\nThe hard palate and upper teeth form in part the walls of the mouth.\r\nAs they are solid fixtures, nothing can be done in the way of\r\ntraining. They furnish a point of impingement in articulation, and\r\nplay their part in sympathetic resonance.\r\n\r\nThe bones which form the roof of the mouth serve also for the floor of\r\nthe nasal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe under teeth also serve as walls of resistance to support the\r\ntongue during the performance of its functions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NASAL AND HEAD CAVITIES\r\n\r\nThe nasal and head cavities are resonating chambers incapable of\r\nspecial training, but their form, size, and the use made of them have\r\na wonderful effect upon the resonance of the voice. If the vibrations\r\nare strong here, all other parts will vibrate in harmonious action.\r\n\r\nWhen responding to the perfectly focused tone the thin walls of the\r\ncavities and the contained air vibrate with surprising force, often\r\nfor the moment blinding the singer when sounding a note intensely.\r\n\r\nHaving in my surgical work demonstrated the existence of a hitherto\r\nunrecognized connecting passage or canal between the air cavities of\r\nthe face and those of the forehead,[2] the play of resonance in the\r\ncavities above the nostrils is more easily understood. The function of\r\nthe cavities known as the _frontal sinuses_ (see Fig. 1) has long been\r\na mystery, but now that their direct connection with the lower\r\ncavities is proven, and the great significance of resonance is also\r\nbeginning to be recognized, the mystery disappears. The same may be\r\nsaid of the other sinuses--_ethmoidal_, _sphenoidal_, and _maxillary_,\r\nand their interconnection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dr. Fillebrown's paper, _A Study of the Relation of the\r\nFrontal Sinus to the Antrum_, was read before the American Dental\r\nAssociation, at Saratoga, August 5, 1895. His investigation showed\r\nthat the funnel-shaped passage known as the _infundibulum_ extends\r\nfrom the _frontal sinus_ directly into the antrum or _maxillary\r\nsinus_. This was afterwards confirmed by Dr. W.H. Cryer and others.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE RESONANCE CAVITIES ON THE PITCH OF THE TONE\r\n\r\nIn instruments changes in the length and form of the resonance\r\nchambers affect the pitch as well as the quality of the tone. This is\r\ndemonstrated in the trombone, French horn, and other wind instruments.\r\nThe lengthening of the tube of the trombone lowers the pitch of the\r\ntone, and the projection of the hand of the performer into the bell of\r\nthe French horn has the effect of raising the pitch of the sound. If\r\nthe variation in length or form is only slight, the result is sharp or\r\nflat, and the instrument is out of tune. In the human instrument all\r\nthe organs act together as a unit; so the fact that the cavities alone\r\nmay affect the pitch is practically of no great significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TONGUE\r\n\r\nThe tongue and the lips are the articulating organs, and the former\r\nhas an important part to play in altering through its movements the\r\nshape of the mouth cavity.\r\n\r\nThe tip of the tongue should habitually rest against the under front\r\nteeth. The tip of the tongue, however, must frequently touch the roof\r\nof the mouth near the upper front teeth, as when pronouncing the\r\nconsonants _c_, _d_, _g_ or _j_, _l_, _n_, _s_, and _t_. The back part\r\nof the tongue must rise a little to close against the soft palate when\r\npronouncing _g_ hard, and _k_, and hard _c_, _q_, and _x_. The soft\r\npalate comes down so far to meet the tongue that the elevation of the\r\nlatter need be but very slight.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking, the demand is not so imperative, but when singing, the\r\nbody of the tongue should lie as flat as possible, so as to enlarge\r\nthe mouth, especially when giving the vowel sounds.\r\n\r\nIf the tongue is sometimes disposed to be unruly, it is the result of\r\nrigidity or misplaced effort in the surrounding parts. This tendency\r\nwill only be aggravated by artificial restraint of any kind. The true\r\nway is to dismiss tongue consciousness, _let go_, and a normal\r\nflexibility will easily manifest itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIPS\r\n\r\nThe lips, equally with the tongue, are organs of articulation. The\r\nupper lip is the principal factor of the two; the under lip seems to\r\nfollow the lead of the upper. The lips need much training, and it can\r\nreadily be given them. While practising to educate the lips, both lips\r\nshould be projected forward and upward, at the same time pronouncing\r\nthe word \"too.\" Bring the edge of the upper lip as high toward the\r\nnose as possible in practice. This will bring the corners of the mouth\r\nforward and lift the lips clear and free from the teeth, and thus add\r\none more resonance cavity. This position of the lips also gives\r\nfreedom for pronunciation. \"The upper lip plays the most active part\r\nin the shaping of the vowels. It should never be drawn against the\r\nteeth when producing vowel tones; indeed, there should be often a\r\nlittle space between the upper lip and the teeth, so that the\r\nvibrations of the sound-waves can have free play.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOSTRILS\r\n\r\nThe nostrils should be dilated as much as possible, as a free, wide,\r\nopen nose gives a free, well-rounded tone, while a contracted nostril\r\ninduces the nasal tone so much dreaded. A proper training of the\r\nfacial muscles makes this dilation possible. Lifting the upper lip and\r\nprojecting it forward aids the action to a great degree.\r\n\r\nThere is a strong tendency to unity of action between the nostrils and\r\nthe lips and the soft palate. The soft palate moves downward and\r\nforward when the upper lip protrudes and the nostrils dilate, and\r\nmoves backward and upward when the nostrils are contracted and the\r\nupper lip allowed to rest upon the teeth.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the best singers have full, round, wide, open nostrils,\r\neither given by nature or acquired by practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FACE\r\n\r\nNot only must the lips and nose be trained, but the muscles of the\r\nface also. These muscles are capable, if educated, of doing important\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe artist on the operatic stage or the speaker on the platform,\r\nwithout facial expression begotten of muscular activity, may lessen by\r\nhalf his power over an audience. To train the facial muscles is a\r\ncomplicated task. To do this, stand before a mirror and make all the\r\nfaces ever thought of by a schoolboy to amuse his schoolmates. Raise\r\neach corner of the lip, wrinkle the nose, quilt the forehead, grin,\r\nlaugh. The grimaces will not enter into a performance, but their\r\neffect upon it will be markedly beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SPEAKING VOICE AND PRONUNCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nA generation ago the speaking voice was even less understood than the\r\nsinging voice. That the two were intimately connected was but half\r\nsurmised. Only an occasional person recognized what is now generally\r\nconceded, that a good way to improve the speaking voice is to\r\ncultivate the singing voice.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 I published a paper in the _Independent Practitioner_ defining\r\nthe singing voice and the speaking voice as identical, and contending\r\nthat the training for each should be the same so far as tone formation\r\nis involved, a conclusion at which I had arrived several years before.\r\nSubsequent experience has only served to confirm this opinion.\r\n\r\nThe past has produced many good speakers, among them Henry Clay,\r\nDaniel Webster, Edwin Booth, Wm. Charles Macready, and Edward Everett.\r\nOf the last Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote: \"It is with delight that one\r\nwho remembers Edward Everett in his robes of rhetorical splendor,\r\nrecalls his full blown, high colored, double flowered periods; the\r\nrich, resonant, grave, far-reaching music of his speech, with just\r\nenough of the nasal vibration to give the vocal sounding-board its\r\nproper value in the harmonies of utterance.\" These examples of correct\r\nvocalization, however, were exceptions to the general rule; they\r\nhappened to speak well, but the physiologic action of the vocal organs\r\nwhich produced such results in those individual cases was not\r\nunderstood, and hence the pupil ambitious to imitate them and develop\r\nthe best of which his voice was capable had no rule by which to\r\nproceed. Few could speak with ease, still fewer could be heard by a\r\nlarge assembly, and sore throats seemed to be the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINGING AND SPEAKING\r\n\r\nIn singing the flow of tone is unbroken between the words, but in\r\nspeaking it is interrupted. In singing tone is sustained and changed\r\nfrom one pitch to another by definite intervals over a wide compass\r\nthat includes notes not attempted in speech. In speaking tone is\r\nunsustained, not defined in pitch, is limited to a narrow compass, and\r\nthe length of the tones is not governed by the measure of music.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these differences, singing and speaking tones are\r\nproduced by the vocal organs in the same way, are focused precisely\r\nalike, have the same resonance, and are delivered in the same manner.\r\nIt has been said that speech differs from song as walking from\r\ndancing. Speech may be called the prose, and song the poetry of\r\nvocalization.\r\n\r\nDuring the past decade the knowledge of the speaking voice has been\r\ngreatly broadened, and the art of cultivating tone has made progress.\r\nThe identity of the singing and speaking voice is becoming more fully\r\nrecognized, and methods are being used to develop the latter similar\r\nto those in use for the training of the former. As Dr. Morell\r\nMackenzie says: \"Singing is a help to good speaking, as the greater\r\nincludes the less.\"\r\n\r\nThe recognition of this truth cannot fail to be a great aid to the\r\nprogress of singing in the public schools, since every enlargement of\r\nexercises common to both speaking and singing helps to solidarity and\r\n_esprit de corps_ in teaching and in learning.\r\n\r\nAn accurate sense of pitch, melody, harmony, and rhythm is necessary\r\nto the singer, but the orator may, by cultivation, develop a speaking\r\nvoice of musical quality without being able to distinguish _Old\r\nHundred_ from _The Last Rose of Summer_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRONUNCIATION\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common observation that American singers, although\r\nthey may be painstaking in their French and German, are indifferent,\r\neven to carelessness, in the clear and finished enunciation of their\r\nnative tongue. Mr. W.J. Henderson, in his recent work, _The Art of the\r\nSinger_, says: \"The typical American singer cannot sing his own\r\nlanguage so that an audience can understand him; nine-tenths of the\r\nsongs we hear are songs without words.\" Happily this condition is\r\ngradually yielding to a better one, stimulated in part by the examples\r\nof visiting singers and actors. In story-telling songs and in\r\noratorio, slovenly delivery is reprehensible, but when the words of a\r\nsong are the lyric flight of a true poet, a careless utterance becomes\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\nBeauty of tone is not everything; the singing of mere sounds, however\r\nlovely, is but a tickling of the ear. The shortcoming of the Italian\r\nschool of singing, as of composition, has been too exclusive devotion\r\nto sensuous beauty of tone as an end in itself. The singer must never\r\nforget that his mission is to =vitalize text with tone=. The songs of\r\nSchubert, Schumann, Franz, Brahms, Grieg, Strauss, and Wolf, as well\r\nas the Wagnerian drama, are significant in their inseparable union of\r\ntext and music. The singer is therefore an interpreter, not of music\r\nalone, but of text made potent by music.\r\n\r\nPronunciation, moreover, concerns not only the listener, but the\r\nsinger and speaker, for pure tone and pure pronunciation cannot be\r\ndivorced, one cannot exist without the other. In his interesting work,\r\n_The Singing of the Future_, Mr. Ffrangcon-Davies insists that, \"the\r\nquickest way to fine tone is through fine pronunciation.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot think except in words, nor voice our thought without speech.\r\nVocal utterance is thought articulate. Therefore, instead of prolonged\r\nattention to tone itself, training should be concentrated upon the\r\nuttered word. The student should aim \"to sing a word rather than a\r\ntone.\" Correct pronunciation and beautiful tone are so interdependent\r\nas to be inseparable.\r\n\r\nThe singer and speaker require all sounds in their purity. To seek to\r\ndevelop the voice along the narrow limits of any single vowel or\r\nsyllable, as for instance the syllable _ah_, is harmful. Not only is\r\nthis vowel sound, as Lilli Lehmann says, \"the most difficult,\" but the\r\nproper pronunciation of all words within the whole range of the voice\r\nis thereby impeded. Diction and tone work should therefore go hand in\r\nhand. \"The way in which vowel melts into vowel and consonants float\r\ninto their places largely determines the character of the tone\r\nitself.\" Without finished pronunciation speech and song of emotional\r\npower are impossible. Gounod, the composer, says, \"Pronunciation\r\ncreates eloquence.\" Mr. Forbes-Robertson, the English master of\r\ndramatic diction, speaking for his own profession says: \"The trouble\r\nwith contemporary stage elocution springs from the actor's very desire\r\nto act well. In his effort to be natural he mumbles his words as too\r\nmany people do in everyday life. Much of this can be corrected by\r\nconstantly bearing in mind the true value of vowels, the percussive\r\nvalue of consonants, and the importance of keeping up the voice until\r\nthe last word is spoken. There must be, so to speak, plenty of wind in\r\nthe bellows. The great thing is to have the sound come from the front\r\nof the mouth.... The actor must learn to breathe deeply from the\r\ndiaphragm and to take his breath at the proper time. Too often the\r\nlast word is not held up, and that is very often the important\r\nword.... Schools for acting are valuable, ... but, after all, the\r\nactors, like other folk, must be taught how to speak as children in\r\nthe home, at school, and in society.\"\r\n\r\nIn pronunciation the words should seem to be formed by the upper lip\r\nand to come out through it. By this method it will be found easy to\r\npronounce distinctly. The words will thus be formed outside the mouth\r\nand be readily heard, as is a person talking in front of, instead of\r\nbehind, a screen. A single, intelligent trial will be sufficient to\r\nshow the correctness of the statement. Thinking of the upper lip as\r\nthe fashioner of the words makes speaking easy and singing a delight.\r\n\r\nTo smile while talking gives to the words a flat, silly sound, hence\r\nthe corners of the mouth should be kept well forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SINGER'S SCALE OF VOWEL SOUNDS\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1  n_ee_\r\n2  n_i_t\r\n3  n_e_t\r\n4  n_a_y\r\n5  n_ai_r\r\n6  n_a_t\r\n7  n_i_gh\r\n8  N_a_h\r\n7' n_o_t\r\n6' n_a_w\r\n5' n_e_r\r\n4' n_u_t\r\n3' n_o_\r\n2' n_oo_k\r\n1' n_oo_.]\r\n\r\nIt may fasten this in mind to remember that at one end of the vowel\r\nscale is--_me_, at the other--_you_.\r\n\r\nThe teeth and lips are most closed at the extremes of this scale, and\r\ngradually open toward _ah_, with which vowel they are widest apart.\r\n\r\nIn the series 1-8 the tongue is highest in the centre for _ee_ and\r\ngradually descends until it lies flat in the mouth for _ah_.\r\n\r\nThe _upper_ pharynx is most closed in 1, most open in 8, and closes\r\nmore and more in the descending series 7'-1'.\r\n\r\nThe _lower_ pharynx gradually opens in the descending series 7'-1'.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Helmholtz, Koenig, Willis, Wheatstone, Appunn, Bell,\r\nand others have shown that each vowel sound has its own characteristic\r\npitch. The Scale of Vowel Sounds given above corresponds closely to\r\nthe order of resonance pitch from the highest _ee_ to the lowest _oo_.\r\nIn the natural resonance of the vowels _ee_ is highest in the head,\r\n_ah_ is midway in the scale, and _oo_ is lowest in resonance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIP POSITION\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows the best position of the lips to give the sound of\r\n_ee_. Hold the under jaw without stiffness and as far from the upper\r\nteeth as is consistent with delivery of the pure sound of this vowel.\r\n\r\nFigure 3 shows the best position of the lips to produce the vowel\r\n_oo_.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 shows the position of the lips for the vowel sound of long\r\n_o_. The opening of the lips should be made as round as is the letter\r\n_o_. When preparing the lips to give the sound of _o_, the inclination\r\nis strong to drop the lower jaw; in practice, to develop action of the\r\nlips, the under jaw would better be held quite immovable. It will be\r\nfound possible to produce all of the vowel sounds without any change\r\nexcept in the form of the opening of the lips. The vowel sound of _i_\r\nis an exception; for as a compound of _ah_ and _ee_, the extremes of\r\nthe vowel scale, it requires two distinct positions for its utterance\r\nwith a movement of transition between; it is not, therefore, a good\r\nvowel for initial practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.]\r\n\r\nFigure 5 shows that the sound _aw_ is produced from _o_ by raising the\r\nedge of the upper lip outward and upward, and flattening the raised\r\nportion laterally.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the position for producing _ah_. It differs from the\r\nposition assumed for _aw_ in that the opening of the lips is larger,\r\nthe upper lip is raised higher, the flat portion is wider, and the\r\nunder lip is a little relaxed. The form of the opening to produce _aw_\r\nis oval; the form for _ah_ is more nearly square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.]\r\n\r\nFigure 7 shows the under jaw relaxed, as it should be in practice, to\r\nenlarge the throat and give roundness and largeness to the tone. The\r\nuse of the word _hung_ will accomplish this end.\r\n\r\nThe vowel sounds illustrated above are embodied in a series of vocal\r\nexercises to be found in Chapter VIII on _Placing the Voice_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nBREATH CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that \"breathing is singing.\" This statement is\r\nequally applicable to speaking. While the aphorism is not literally\r\ntrue, it is true that without properly controlled breathing the best\r\nsinging or speaking tone cannot be produced, for tone is but vocalized\r\nbreath; hence in the cultivation of the voice, breathing is the first\r\nfunction to receive attention.\r\n\r\nFor singer or speaker, the correct use of the breathing apparatus\r\ndetermines the question of success or failure; for without mastery of\r\nthe motive power all else is unavailing. For a voice user, therefore,\r\nthe first requisite is a well-developed chest, the second, complete\r\ncontrol of it.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that a singer's breathing is something strange\r\nor complex, for it is nothing more than _an amplification of normal,\r\nhealthy breathing_. In contrast, however, to the undisciplined casual\r\nbreathing of the general public, the singer is a professional\r\nbreather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSCLES OF RESPIRATION\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of respiratory muscles, one for inspiration and\r\nanother for expiration,--twenty-two or more in all. The principal\r\nmuscles of inspiration are the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles\r\nthat elevate the ribs. The chief muscles of expiration are the four\r\nsets of abdominal muscles and the intercostal muscles that depress the\r\nribs. The diaphragm is _not_ a muscle of _expiration_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is in form like an inverted bowl (Fig. 8). It forms the\r\nfloor of the thorax (chest) and the roof of the abdomen. It is\r\nattached by a strong tendon to the spinal column behind, and to the\r\nwalls of the thorax at its lowest part, which is below the ribs. In\r\nfront its attachment is to the cartilage at the pit of the stomach. It\r\nalso connects with the transverse abdominal muscle. The diaphragm\r\nbeing convex, in inspiration the contraction of its fibres flattens it\r\ndownward and presses down the organs in the abdomen, thus increasing\r\nthe depth of the thorax. Expiration depends wholly on other muscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.]\r\n\r\nThe muscles so far mentioned are all that need \"conscious education;\"\r\nthe others will act with them voluntarily, automatically. The\r\nabdominal muscles relax during inspiration and the diaphragm relaxes\r\nduring expiration, thus rendering the forces nearly equal, though the\r\nstrength is in favor of the expiratory muscles. This is what is\r\nneeded, for the breath while speaking or singing must go out under\r\nmuch greater tension than is necessary for inhalation. Inspiration\r\nshould be as free as possible from obstruction when singing or\r\nspeaking. Expiration must be under _controlled_ pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LUNGS\r\n\r\nThe lungs are spongy bodies which have no activity of their own beyond\r\na little elasticity. They are controlled by the muscles of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nFigure 8 shows the organs of the body in their natural positions. The\r\ndiaphragm is relaxed and curved upward, as in expiration. During\r\ninspiration the diaphragm is drawn down until it lies nearly flat.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSPIRATION\r\n\r\nThe intercostal muscles raise the ribs. The diaphragm is drawn down by\r\ncontraction, thus adding to the enlargement of the chest by increasing\r\nits depth. The abdominal muscles relax and allow the stomach, liver,\r\nand other organs in the abdomen to move downward to make room for the\r\ndepressed diaphragm. This causes a vacuum in the chest. The lungs\r\nexpand to fill this vacuum and the air rushes in to fill the expanding\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPIRATION\r\n\r\nThe intercostal, and a part of the abdominal, muscles depress the ribs\r\nand lessen the chest cavity anteriorly and laterally. The abdominal\r\nmuscles compress the abdomen and force up the diaphragm which is now\r\nrelaxed, thus lessening the depth of the thorax. This pressure forces\r\nthe air from the lungs and prepares them for another inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECT METHOD\r\n\r\nThat the lateral-abdominal--more accurately chest-abdominal--breathing\r\nis correct and natural for both male, and female, and that the\r\nshoulders should remain as fixed as were Demosthenes' under the points\r\nof the swords hung over them, is now so generally admitted as to need\r\nno argument here. If any one has still a doubt on the subject let him\r\nobserve a sleeping infant. It affords a perfect example of\r\nlateral-abdominal breathing, and no one can have a suspicion of sex\r\nfrom any difference in this function. Among the lower animals sex\r\nshows no difference in breathing at any age. All the peculiarities of\r\nfemale breathing are the results of habits acquired in after life.\r\n\r\nChest and shoulder heaving are vicious and evidence impeded breathing.\r\nThe singer who, forgetting the lower thorax, breathes with the upper\r\nonly is sure to fail. Therefore breathe from the _lower_ part of the\r\ntrunk, using the whole muscular system coördinately--_from below_\r\nupward. In other words breathe deeply, and _control deeply_, but with\r\nthe whole body--from below, not with the upper chest only, or with\r\nlateral expansion only, or abdominal expansion only.\r\n\r\nEvery teacher and pupil should remember that \"singing and speaking\r\nrequire wind and muscle,\" hence the breathing power must be fully\r\ndeveloped. Weak breathing and failure to properly focus the voice are\r\nthe most frequent causes of singing off the key. They are much more\r\ncommon and mischievous than lack of \"ear.\"\r\n\r\nDr. May tested the breathing of 85 persons, most of them Indians, and\r\nfound that 79 out of the 85 used abdominal breathing. The chest\r\nbreathers were from classes \"civilized\" and more or less \"cultured.\"\r\n\r\nNature has provided that for quiet breathing when at rest the air\r\nshall pass through the nose. But when a person is taking active\r\nexercise, and consequently demands more air, he naturally and of\r\nnecessity opens the mouth so as to breathe more fully. While speaking\r\nor singing the air is necessarily taken in through the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREATH CONTROL\r\n\r\nFirmness of tone depends upon steadiness of breath pressure.\r\nSteadiness of tone depends upon a control of the breath which allows a\r\nminimum volume of air to pass out under sufficient tension to produce\r\nvocalization.\r\n\r\nThe tension and flow of breath can be gradually lessened until the\r\ntone vanishes and not even a whisper remains.\r\n\r\nPower and largeness of tone depend first upon the =right use of the\r\nresonant cavities=, and second upon the =volume of breath used under\r\nproper control=.\r\n\r\nIn producing high tones the breath is delivered in less amount than\r\nfor the low tones, but under greater tension. Absolute control of the\r\nbreath is necessary to produce the best results of which a voice is\r\ncapable. Full control of the breath insures success to a good voice;\r\nwithout it the best voice is doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nWhen muscular action is fully mastered, and the proper method of\r\nbreathing understood and established, the muscles of inspiration and\r\nexpiration will act one against the other, so that the act of\r\nbreathing may be suspended at any moment, whether the lungs are full,\r\nor partly full, or empty. This is muscular control of the breath.\r\nCorrect breathing is health giving and strength giving; it promotes\r\nnutrition, lessens the amount of adipose tissue, and reinforces every\r\nphysical requisite essential to speaking and singing.\r\n\r\n\r\nA CURE FOR NERVOUSNESS\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too widely advertised that the surest remedy for that\r\ntorture of singers and speakers, nervousness, is the great\r\ntranquillizer,--quiet, deep breathing, deeply controlled. The breath\r\nof nervousness is quick, irregular, and shallow, therefore, take a\r\nfew, slow, deliberate, deep, and _rhythmic_ inhalations of pure air\r\nthrough the nostrils, and the panting gasp of agitation will vanish.\r\nAs a help toward deepening the breath and overcoming the spasmodic,\r\nclavicular habit, inhale quietly and slowly through the nose, or\r\nslowly sip the air through the nearly closed lips as if you were\r\nsipping the inmost breath of life itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECESSITY OF BREATHING EXERCISES\r\n\r\nTo acquire control of breathing, proper exercises must be\r\nintelligently and persistently followed. In mankind, nature seems to\r\nhave been diverted from her normal course so that we seldom find an\r\nindividual who breathes correctly without education in the matter.\r\nWhat we have said on breathing is based on the premise that\r\nrespiration involves coördinate action of the body from collar-bone to\r\nthe base of the abdomen; that is, expanding and contracting the chest\r\nand abdomen simultaneously. This is called \"lateral-abdominal\"\r\nbreathing; as the chest is the thoracic cavity, \"abdomino-thoracic\"\r\nhas been suggested as brief and more strictly scientific.\r\n\r\nWork on any other lines fails to develop the full power and quality of\r\nthe voice. Weak breathing is a prime cause of throaty tones. In such\r\ncases an effort is made to increase the tone by pinching the larynx.\r\nBut this compresses the vocal cords, increases the resistance to the\r\npassage of the breath, and brings rigidities that prevent proper\r\nresonance. The true way is to increase the wind supply, as does the\r\norganist.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRECT BREATHING ILLUSTRATED\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the outline of correct breathing. The inner\r\nabdominal line shows the limit of expiration; the outer line shows the\r\nlimit of full inspiration.\r\n\r\nFigure 9 shows the limit of full expiration and inspiration of the\r\nmale, side view.\r\n\r\nFigure 10 shows the lateral expansion of the ribs in both expiration\r\nand inspiration, front view of the male.\r\n\r\nThe expansion cannot be great at this part of the chest, as the side\r\nis so short a distance from the backbone to which the ribs are\r\nattached. The movement of the ribs in front is much greater, as Fig. 9\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nFigure 11 shows the front expansion and contraction in the breathing\r\nof the female, side view.\r\n\r\nFigure 12 shows the lateral expansion of the chest in the female,\r\nfront view.\r\n\r\nThese diagrams are made from photographs, and thus true to life. It\r\nwill be noticed that there is no difference in the breathing outline\r\nbetween these subjects. The female subject, though a good singer, had\r\nhad no training in breathing. She previously insisted that she used\r\nonly the chest breathing, and did not use the abdominal muscles, but\r\nactual test revealed the condition to be that shown in Figure 11 and\r\nconvinced her that she was mistaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.]\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that many other singers who now think they are\r\nusing only the high chest respiration would, if subjected to the same\r\ntest, find themselves similarly mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe contraction incident to forced expiration is much more tense than\r\nthe enlargement of forced inspiration. When singing or speaking,\r\nforced inspiration is not used. Experience shows that the change in\r\nsize of the body during speaking or singing is usually small.\r\nOccasionally, long passages in music demand that the expulsive power\r\nof the breathing apparatus be used to its limit.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMY OF BREATH\r\n\r\nThe quantity of air taken in with a single inspiration is, in quiet\r\nbreathing, according to Prof. Mills,[3] from twenty to thirty cubic\r\ninches, but this may be increased in the deepest inspiration to about\r\none hundred cubic inches. In forcible expiration about one hundred\r\ncubic inches may be expelled, but even then the residual air that\r\ncannot be expelled is about one hundred cubic inches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. Wesley Mills, _Voice Production_, 1906.]\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, the quantity of breath inhaled that is\r\nsignificant, it is the amount _controlled_. Get, therefore, all the\r\nbreath necessary, and keep it, but without undue effort and _without\r\nrigidity_.\r\n\r\nTo test the amount of breath used in prolonged vocalization, a person\r\nskilled in the art of breathing, after an ordinary inspiration, closed\r\nhis lips, stopped his nostrils, and began to vocalize. He found that\r\nthe mouth with distended cheeks held sufficient breath to continue a\r\nsubstantial tone for twenty-three seconds.\r\n\r\nWhile these experiments show that very little amount or force of\r\nbreath is needed to produce effective tones, the impression must exist\r\nin the mind of the performer that there is a free flow of breath\r\nthrough the larynx; otherwise the tone will seem restricted and will\r\nbe weak. The forced holding back of the breath begets a restraint that\r\nhas a bad effect on the singer's delivery. While the breath must be\r\ncontrolled, there is such a thing as an exaggerated \"breath control\"\r\nthat makes free delivery of the voice impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible to _overcrowd_ the lungs with air. Do not,\r\ntherefore, make the mistake of always taking the largest possible\r\nbreath. Reserve this for the climaxes, and inhale according to the\r\nrequirements of the phrase and its dynamics. The constant taking of\r\ntoo much breath is a common mistake, but trying to sing too long on\r\none breath is another.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INITIAL USE OF BREATH FORCE\r\n\r\nThe breath force when properly employed seems to be expended in\r\nstarting the vibrations in the larynx; the vibrations are then\r\ntransmitted to the air in the resonance cavities, and there the\r\nperfected tone sets the outer air in motion, through which the tone\r\nvibrations are conveyed to the ear of the listener.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESERVE BREATH POWER\r\n\r\nThe correctly trained singer or speaker will never allow the breath\r\npower to be exhausted. Some breath should be taken in at every\r\nconvenient interval between the words, according to the punctuation,\r\nbut never between syllables of a word; this is correct phrasing. In\r\nthis way the lungs are kept nearly full, and breathing is at its best.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of breath exhaustion is _wasted_ breath. This waste\r\ncomes from exhaling more breath (more motive power) than the tone\r\nrequires, and _breath that does not become tone is wasted_. This fault\r\nis largely induced by lack of proper resonance adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe singer should always feel able to sing another note or to speak\r\nanother word. To sing or speak thirty or forty counts with one breath\r\nis useful practice but poor performance. Occasionally, long runs in\r\nsinging may compel an exception. Half-empty lungs lower the pitch of\r\nthe tone, lessen the resonance, and weaken the voice, rendering the\r\nlast note of the song and the last word of the sentence inaudible. The\r\nbreathing must not be forced, but enough air must be furnished to\r\nproduce the proper full vibrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREATH MASTERY\r\n\r\nWhat then does perfect control of the breath mean?\r\n\r\n1. Ability to fill the lungs to their capacity either quickly or\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n2. Ability to breathe out as quickly or slowly as the occasion\r\ndemands.\r\n\r\n3. Ability to suspend inspiration, with the throat open, whether the\r\nlungs are full or not, and to resume the process at will without\r\nhaving lost any of the already inspired air.\r\n\r\n4. Ability to exhale under the same restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe above four points are common to speaking and singing, but singing\r\ninvolves further:\r\n\r\n5. Ability to sing and sustain the voice on an _ordinary_ breath.\r\n\r\n6. Ability to _quietly_ breathe as often as text and phrase permit.\r\n\r\n7. Ability to breathe so that the fullest inspiration _brings no\r\nfatigue_.\r\n\r\n8. Ability to so economize the breath that the _reserve is never\r\nexhausted_.\r\n\r\n9. The ability to breathe so naturally, so unobtrusively, that\r\n_neither breath nor lack of breath is ever suggested to the\r\nlistener_--this is the very perfection of the art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBREATHING EXERCISES\r\n\r\n\r\nEnough has been said in the preceding chapter to make clear the\r\nnecessity of breath control, and to show what constitutes this control\r\nfor the singer--the professional breather.\r\n\r\nIf the singer's breathing is nothing but an amplification of normal,\r\nhealthy breathing, why dwell upon it, why not let it develop of\r\nitself?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, many teachers have taken this attitude, overlooking the\r\nfact that, although life is dependent on normal, healthy breathing,\r\nsuch breathing is, in civilized communities, not the rule but the\r\nexception, simply because normal living is rare; the artificiality of\r\nmodern life forbids it. The high pressure under which most people live\r\ninduces mental tension together with the consequent nervous and\r\nmuscular tension. We are, without being conscious of it, so habituated\r\nto unnatural tension that automatic breathing is shallow and irregular\r\ninstead of being deep and rhythmic.\r\n\r\nThe task, therefore, is to reclaim a neglected birthright--natural\r\nbreathing--to make it habitual and amplify it.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Breathing exercises to be invigorating and purifying demand plenty\r\nof fresh air.\r\n\r\n2. At first do not practise longer than ten minutes at a time, three\r\ntimes a day.\r\n\r\n3. Gradually lengthen the time without overdoing. When tired stop.\r\n\r\n4. The best time is before dressing in the morning, with the window\r\nopen. The worst time is directly after a meal.\r\n\r\n5. Maintain throughout an easy, flexible poise.\r\n\r\n6. Breathe as _deeply_ as possible without abdominal distention. The\r\ngreatest expansion should be felt at the lower end of the breast-bone.\r\n\r\n7. Breathe as _broadly_ as possible, expanding the sides without\r\ntension.\r\n\r\n8. Breathe as _high_ as possible without shoulder movement or\r\nstiffness.\r\n\r\n9. Use not the high breath alone, or the mid-breath, or the low\r\nbreath, but use the _complete_ breath.\r\n\r\n10. Breathe _rhythmically_ by counting mentally.\r\n\r\n11. Breathe _thoughtfully_ rather than mechanically.\r\n\r\n12. Do not crowd the lungs or lay stress on the mere quantity of air\r\nyou can inhale. The intake of breath is, for the singer, secondary to\r\nits control, economy, and application in song. Increase of lung\r\ncapacity will duly appear.\r\n\r\n13. When not singing, speaking or practising an exercise that demands\r\nit, _keep your mouth shut_.\r\n\r\n\r\nATTITUDE\r\n\r\nDress the neck and body loosely, so as to give the throat and trunk\r\nperfect freedom. Place the hands on the hips, so as to free the chest\r\nfrom the weight of the arms. Stand erect, evenly upon the balls of the\r\nfeet; the body straight, but not strained. Raise the back of the head\r\nslightly without bending the neck. This action will straighten the\r\nspine, place the chest forward, and bring the abdomen backward into\r\nits proper relation.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of people are shallow breathers, chest breathers,\r\nwho when told to take a \"deep breath\" do not know what is meant. It is\r\ntherefore necessary for them first to learn what a deep breath is, and\r\nthen how to take it.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise I\r\n\r\nFOR THOSE WHO DO NOT KNOW WHAT A DEEP BREATH IS\r\n\r\nBefore rising in the morning, remove your pillow and while flat on\r\nyour back place one hand lightly on the abdomen, the other on the\r\nlower ribs. Relax the whole body, giving up your whole weight to the\r\nbed. Inhale through the nostrils slowly, evenly, and deeply, while\r\nmentally counting one, two, three, four, etc. As you inhale, notice\r\n(_a_) the gradual expansion of the abdomen, (_b_) the side expansion\r\nof the lower ribs, (_c_) the rise and inflation of the chest, without\r\nraising the shoulders. Hold the breath while mentally counting four\r\n(four seconds), then suddenly let the breath go, and notice the\r\ncollapse of the abdomen and lower chest. Remember _the inspiration\r\nmust be slow and deep, the expiration sudden and complete_. Practise\r\nthis preliminary exercise for not more than ten minutes each morning\r\nfor a week. The second week hold the breath six seconds, instead of\r\nfour, and gradually increase the time, without overdoing.\r\n\r\nWhile, for a novice, the exercises may be taken at first in bed, this\r\nis but a preliminary to their practise standing in easy poise as\r\ndirected in the preceding section.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise II\r\n\r\nSLOW INHALATION WITH SUDDEN EXPULSION\r\n\r\nInhale as in I; hold the breath four counts (seconds) or more; then\r\nexpel the air vigorously in one breath through the wide open mouth.\r\nThe beginner is often helped in acquiring a deep breath by slowly\r\nsipping breath. Therefore as a variant to Exercise II practise:\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise III\r\n\r\nSIPPING THE BREATH, WITH QUICK EXHALATION\r\n\r\nThrough the smallest possible opening of the lips, while mentally\r\ncounting, inhale very slowly and steadily; hold two to four counts,\r\nthen expel the air all at once through the wide open mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise IV\r\n\r\nFOR RIB EXPANSION\r\n\r\nTo more completely arouse dormant muscles that should play an\r\nimportant part in breathing, place the hands against the sides, thumbs\r\nwell back, take, through the nostrils or the slightly parted lips,\r\nsix short catch-breaths, moving the ribs _out at the side_ with each\r\ncatch-breath. Hold the breath two counts, and exhale through the mouth\r\nwith six short expiratory puffs, drawing the ribs _in at the side_\r\nwith each puff.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise V\r\n\r\nSLOW INHALATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION\r\n\r\nInhale as in I, while mentally counting one, two, three, four, etc.,\r\nuntil the inhalation seems complete. Hold the breath four or more\r\ncounts; then exhale through the nostrils slowly and evenly while\r\nmentally counting to the number reached in the inspiration. With\r\npractice the number of counts will gradually increase. Do not,\r\nhowever, force the increase. The muscles that control inspiration are\r\npowerful; do not, therefore, make the mistake of seeking to control\r\nexpiration by contraction of the glottis. Practise these exercises\r\nwith an open throat and depend on the breathing muscles for control of\r\nthe outgoing air. Remember that _singing is control of breath in\r\nexit_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise VI\r\n\r\nRAPID INSPIRATION WITH SLOW EXPIRATION\r\n\r\nInhale through the nostrils quickly, deeply, and forcefully (one\r\ncount); hold two counts; exhale through the nostrils evenly, steadily,\r\nand as slowly as possible while mentally counting one, two, three,\r\nfour, etc. With practice gradually increase the number of counts for\r\nthe exhalation.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise VII\r\n\r\nFARINELLI'S GREAT EXERCISE\r\n\r\nThe Cavalier, Don Carlo Broschi, better known as Farinelli\r\n(1705-1782), the world's greatest singer in bravura and coloratura,\r\nwas a pupil of Porpora and Bernacchi. There was no branch of the art\r\nwhich he did not carry to the highest perfection, and the successes of\r\nhis youth did not prevent him from continuing his study, or, when his\r\nname was famous, from acquiring by much perseverance another style\r\nand a superior method. His breath control was considered so marvelous\r\nin that day of great singers, it is said, that the art of taking and\r\nkeeping the breath so softly and easily that no one could perceive it\r\nbegan and died with him. He is said to have spent several hours daily\r\nin practising the following exercise:\r\n\r\nAs in Exercise III, sip the breath slowly and steadily through the\r\nsmallest possible opening of the lips; hold it a few counts, then\r\nexhale very slowly and steadily through the smallest possible opening\r\nof the lips.\r\n\r\nFarinelli's exercise is not for beginners.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise VIII\r\n\r\nTHE CLEANSING BREATH\r\n\r\nFor ventilating and sweeping the lungs, for quick refreshment after\r\nfatigue, and for use always at the close of your exercises, inhale\r\nthrough the nostrils slowly a complete breath; hold two to four\r\ncounts, purse the lips tightly and expel through them a small puff of\r\nair, hold two counts, puff one, hold two counts, puff one, and so on\r\nuntil the exhalation is complete. A few trials should convince you\r\nthat this simple exercise is of great value.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALF-BREATH\r\n\r\nIn both singing and speaking, the sustained delivery of long phrases\r\nor sentences sometimes makes unusual demands on the breath supply. It\r\nis a law of good singing that every phrase should end with the breath\r\nunexhausted. When the flow of text and music forbid the taking of a\r\nfull breath, half-breaths must be quietly taken at convenient points.\r\nInstead of letting the whole reservoir of motive power exhaust itself\r\nand then completely refill it, we should, by taking these\r\nhalf-breaths, maintain a reserve. A notable advocate of the use of the\r\nhalf-breath in singing is that past mistress of sustained and smooth\r\ndelivery, Marcella Sembrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nREGISTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of registers has always been the _bête noire_ of\r\nvocalists, a source of controversy and confusion. The term \"register,\"\r\nas commonly used, means a series of tones of a characteristic clang or\r\nquality, produced by the same mechanism. The term \"break\" is generally\r\nused to indicate the point at which a new register with sudden change\r\nappears.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of registers lay stress either on the changes in\r\nlaryngeal action, or the changes in tone quality. Before the days of\r\nthe laryngoscope, registers were treated simply as different qualities\r\nof tone, characterizing a certain portion of the voice's compass.\r\n\r\nThose who encourage the cultivation of register consciousness claim to\r\ndo so for the sake of the differences in tone-color which they\r\nassociate with the different \"registers.\" The purpose of the following\r\nchapters is to show that the quality or color of a tone is altogether\r\na matter of resonance, and _not_ a question of laryngeal action.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the mechanism of the larynx is not voluntary in its action,\r\nbut automatic, and even if a singer knew how the vocal cords should\r\nact it would not help him in the least to govern their action. The\r\nfact is that the results of laryngoscopic study of the vocal cords\r\nhave been disappointing and contradictory and investigators have\r\nfailed to define what correct laryngeal action is. There are those who\r\neven deny that the vocal cords govern the pitch of the voice.\r\n\r\nIn her thoughtful _Philosophy of Singing_, Clara Kathleen Rogers,\r\nwhile upholding \"registers,\" says that considered physiologically \"the\r\ndifferent registers of the voice should be regarded by the singer as\r\nonly so many _modifications in the quality of tone_, which\r\nmodifications are inherent in the voice itself.\" She then adds\r\nsignificantly: \"These modifications are not brought about by conscious\r\nadjustments of the parts employed, as any interference with the parts\r\nwill produce that obstacle to quality we call a 'break.'\"\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of modern singers, Mme. Lilli Lehmann, in her\r\ninteresting work, _How to Sing_, says: \"Do registers exist by nature?\r\nNo. It may be said that they are created through long years of\r\nspeaking in the vocal range that is easiest to the person, or in one\r\nadopted by imitation.\" She speaks of three ranges of the voice, or,\r\nrather, three sections of the vocal range, as chest, middle, and head,\r\nsaying, \"All three form registers _when exaggerated_.\" After speaking\r\nof the hopeless confusion that results from clinging to the\r\nappellations of chest, middle, and head _register_, confounding voice\r\nwith register, she concludes:\r\n\r\n\"As long as the word 'register' is kept in use the registers will not\r\ndisappear, and yet the register question must be swept away, to give\r\nplace to another class of ideas, sounder views on the part of\r\nteachers, and a truer conception on the part of singers and pupils.\"\r\n\r\nThe trend of recent thought on this subject is further shown in\r\nFfrangcon-Davies' important work, _The Singing of the Future_, where,\r\nhaving in mind \"the useless torture to which thousands of students\r\nhave been subjected,\" he characterizes \"breaks\" and \"registers\" as\r\n\"paraphernalia supplied by credulity to charlatanism\"; and adds: \"How\r\nmany a poor pupil has become a practical monomaniac on the subject of\r\n_that break in my voice between D and D sharp_!\"\r\n\r\nMy own studies convince me that there is but one register, or, rather,\r\nno such thing as register, save as it applies to the compass of the\r\nvoice; and that chest, middle, head, and all other registers are\r\ncreations of false education. Training based upon the theory of many\r\nregisters results in an artificial and unnatural division of the\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOICE AND INSTRUMENTS COMPARED\r\n\r\nThe organ of the voice has long been considered the analogue of every\r\nother instrument except in regard to registers. Investigation\r\nindicates that it is analogous in this respect also. Compare the voice\r\ninstrument with the pianoforte, violin, and organ and the similarity\r\nwill plainly appear. The artificial instruments undergo no change when\r\nmaking a tone of higher or lower pitch other than the attuning of the\r\nvibrator to the pitch desired. All other parts remain the same. So\r\nwhen the voice is correctly focused and delivered, the only change\r\nincident to altered pitch is that made in the vibrator so as to give\r\nthe proper number of vibrations for the pitch required. If the scale\r\nis sung down, using the same vowel sound for the whole scale, the\r\ncomparison will be appreciated; the pupil will not be conscious of any\r\nchange in the vocal organ or experience any difficulty in descending\r\nthe scale. Faithful advocates of the theory of many registers say:\r\n\"Whenever in doubt about the production of a tone, sing _down_ to it\r\nfrom some tone above it, never _upward_ from a tone below,\" for they\r\nfind that singing down \"blends the registers.\" This we believe is\r\nbecause in singing down muscular and nerve tension is gradually\r\nrelaxed and consequently there is no \"register\" change in the voice.\r\n\r\nA study of the church organ will, I think, make this matter clear. The\r\norgan has many so-called registers, as the _vox humana_, _flute_,\r\n_oboe_, etc. These differ in the character of tone produced, because\r\nof the size and shape of the different sets of pipes and the material,\r\nwood or metal, of which they are made. But each similarly constructed\r\nset of pipes forms only one register, and the pitch of the set varies\r\nfrom low to high without any abrupt change in quality. All the tones\r\nare produced by the same methods and means, the bellows, the vibrator,\r\nand the pipe. In length and diameter, the pipe is proper to the tone\r\nproduced: a short pipe of small diameter for the high tones, and a\r\nlong, wide pipe for the bass tones.\r\n\r\nThe short vibrations of the high tones are perceived by the ear as\r\naffecting the air only, while the tones of the lowest bass pipes\r\nshake the solid foundations as well as the superstructure. So with the\r\nhuman voice. The coarser tissues cannot answer to the short vibrations\r\nof the upper tones, because they cannot move so quickly, while they\r\ncan, and do, respond to the vibrations of the low tones. This may\r\ncause some difference in degree, but not in kind. With all tones\r\nfocused alike, the low tones of the human organ may be regarded as\r\nhead tones plus the vibrations of the coarser tissues.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of registers that they are \"acoustic illusions which\r\ndisappear in the perfectly trained voice.\" As soon as the singer has\r\nlearned to use his voice normally all these defective changes\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO CASES\r\n\r\nThe following incident illustrates the fact that registers are an\r\nartificial creation: A young lady who had been a patient of the author\r\nsince her childhood studied elocution in a metropolitan city, and to\r\nimprove her voice took vocal music lessons of a teacher of more than\r\nlocal repute. He found no end of trouble in teaching her to \"blend the\r\nregisters,\" and she had utterly failed to acquire the art. One summer\r\nshe came back for professional services and told her troubles. During\r\nthe few weeks of her stay she followed the author's suggestions, and\r\nwas fully convinced of their correctness and efficiency. Upon\r\nreturning to her lessons, she followed, without any explanations, the\r\nmethod that had been outlined for her. Her success in \"blending the\r\nregisters\" was a surprise to her teacher who heartily congratulated\r\nher upon what she had accomplished during the summer.\r\n\r\nAnother case is that of a young lady who was under the author's\r\ndirection as to vocal culture from childhood. As early as four years\r\nof age she was taught by the use of a few exercises to focus the voice\r\nin the nose and head, and to recognize the head vibrations by a light\r\ntouch of the finger. When about seven years old, she took ten lessons\r\nof a teacher on the same lines, and at fifteen years of age took\r\nanother brief course. In the meantime she had only the practice\r\nobtained by singing with the pupils in the schools she attended.\r\nLater, of her own volition, she sang more, and carefully applied the\r\nprinciples she had been taught, with the result that her voice\r\ncompassed nearly two octaves, evenly and smoothly, with no break or\r\nchange of focus or quality, or other intimation of \"register,\" and she\r\ndeveloped a speaking voice of more than ordinary quality and\r\nresonance.\r\n\r\nIt has also been my lot to aid in the development of the voices of\r\nmany patients after a surgical operation for cleft palate. Success has\r\nproven the correctness and efficacy of the principles set forth in\r\nthese pages.\r\n\r\nA majority of the more than fifty authors whose works I have examined\r\nhave laid great stress on the distinction between head and chest\r\ntones, open and closed tones, pure and impure tones, have warned\r\nagainst the nasal tone, and have constantly advocated a natural tone.\r\nThat there is no essential difference between a head tone and a chest\r\ntone has already been discussed and, it would seem, conclusively\r\nproven. Any tone, closed or open, is pure and musical if properly\r\nfocused and delivered, and the singer is at liberty to use either upon\r\nany note of the scale if it will serve better to express the sentiment\r\nhe wishes to convey to the hearer. The cooing of the love song, the\r\ncry of alarm for help, and the shout of the military charge require\r\nvery different qualities of voice to express the feelings, yet each\r\nmay be musical and will be so if properly delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRESONANCE IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intimate relationship existing between voice culture and the\r\nscience of acoustics was formerly slightly perceived. The teaching of\r\nsinging, as an art, then rested altogether on an empirical basis, and\r\nthe acoustics of singing had not received the attention of scientists.\r\n\r\nWith the publication in 1863 of Helmholtz's great work[4] a new era\r\nbegan, although singer and scientist yet continue to look upon each\r\nother with suspicion. Teachers of the voice, casting about for a\r\nscientific basis for their work, were greatly impressed with\r\nHelmholtz's revelations in regard to vocal resonance--the fact that\r\ntones are modified in quality as well as increased in power by the\r\nresonance of the air in the cavities of pharynx and head.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen als physiologische\r\nGrundlage für die Theorie der Musik._ (The Sensations of Tone as a\r\nPhysiological Basis for the Theory of Music.)]\r\n\r\nWriting in 1886, Edmund J. Meyer speaks of the importance of a \"study\r\nof the influence of the different resonance cavities as the voice is\r\ncolored by one or the other, and the tuning each to each and each to\r\nall\"; yet, he adds, \"the subject is seldom heard of outside of books.\"\r\n\r\nThe basic importance of resonance in the use of the voice is still too\r\nlittle recognized, though obvious enough in the construction of\r\nmusical instruments. With the exception of a few instruments of\r\npercussion, all musical instruments possess three elements,--a\r\n_motor_, a _vibrator_, and a _resonator_. The violin has the moving\r\nbow for a motor, the strings for a vibrator, and the hollow body for a\r\nresonator. The French horn has the lungs of the performer for a motor,\r\nthe lips for a vibrator, and the gradually enlarging tube, terminating\r\nin the flaring bell, for a resonator. In the pianoforte the\r\nhammer-stroke, the strings, and the sounding-board perform the\r\ncorresponding offices. Though improvements in other parts of the piano\r\nhave done much to increase the volume of the tone, yet in the radical\r\nchange of form, size, and other physical qualities of the\r\nsounding-board consists the evolution of the modern pianoforte from\r\nthe primitive clavichord.\r\n\r\nIn all these instruments the quality and power of the tone depend upon\r\nthe presence of these three elements,--the perfection of their\r\nconstruction, their proper relation as to size and position, and the\r\nperfect adaptation of each part. A split sounding-board spoils the\r\npianoforte, the indented bell destroys the sweet tone of the French\r\nhorn, and a cracked fiddle is the synonym for pandemonium itself.\r\n\r\nThe quality and power of resonance is well illustrated by a\r\ntuning-fork, which, if set in vibration, can, unaided, scarcely be\r\nheard by the person holding it. But if rested on a table, or a plate\r\nof glass, or, better still, on the bridge of a violin, its tones may\r\nbe distinctly heard throughout a large hall.\r\n\r\nThe vibrating violin string when detached from the body of this\r\ninstrument, although attuned to pitch, gives absolutely no musical\r\nsound; the lips of the player placed on the mouthpiece detached from\r\nthe tube and bell of the brass instrument produce only a splutter; and\r\na pianoforte without a sounding-board is nil. The air column in the\r\ntube of the French horn, and the sounding-board of the pianoforte\r\ndevelop the vibrations caused by the lips and strings into musical\r\ntones pleasing to the ear. The tuning-fork alone can scarcely be\r\nheard, while the induced vibrations it sets up through properly\r\nadjusted resonance may be audible far away.\r\n\r\nThe vocal cords alone cannot make music any more than can the lips of\r\nthe cornet player apart from his instrument. _The tone produced by the\r\nvibrations alone of the two very small vocal bands must, in the nature\r\nof things, be very feeble._\r\n\r\nNinety-and-nine persons if asked the question, what produces tone in\r\nthe human-voice, would reply, \"the vibrations of the vocal cords,\"\r\nand stop there, as if that were all; whereas the answer is very\r\nincomplete--not even half an answer.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the irrational and injurious \"teaching\" of singing\r\nthat prevails everywhere, and of the controversy that befogs the\r\nsubject, is due to the widely prevalent notion that the little vocal\r\ncords are the principal cause of tone, whereas they are in themselves\r\ninsignificant as sound producers.\r\n\r\n=It is the vibrations of the air in the resonance chambers of the human\r\ninstrument, together with the induced vibrations of the instrument\r\nitself, which give tone its sonority, its reach, its color, and\r\nemotional power.=\r\n\r\nThat this is not an empirical statement but a scientific fact, a few\r\nsimple experiments will demonstrate.\r\n\r\nTone, in the musical sense, is the result of rapid periodic vibration.\r\nThe pitch of tone depends upon the _number_ of vibrations in a given\r\nperiod; the loudness of tone depends upon the _amplitude_ of the\r\nvibrations; the quality of tone depends upon the _form_ of the\r\nvibrations; and the form of the vibrations depends upon the\r\n_resonator_.\r\n\r\nThe fact that pure white light is a compound of all the tints of the\r\nrainbow into which it may be resolved by the prism is well known, but\r\nthe analogous fact that a pure musical tone is a compound of tones of\r\ndifferent rates of vibration, tones of different pitch, is not so much\r\na matter of common knowledge, and not so obvious.\r\n\r\nAnalysis shows that a musical tone consists of a fundamental note and\r\na series of overtones.[5] The ear is quite capable of recognizing many\r\nof these overtones and may be trained to do so. The most obvious can\r\nbe readily separated from a fundamental by a simple experiment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: For fuller exposition see Tyndall on _Sound_, or the\r\nsection devoted to _Acoustics_ in any text-book on Physics.]\r\n\r\nThe overtones arrange themselves in a definite order, as follows: (1)\r\nthe fundamental or prime tone; (2) an overtone one octave above the\r\nfundamental; (3) an overtone a fifth above No. 2; (4) an overtone a\r\nfourth above No. 3 (two octaves above the fundamental); (5) an\r\novertone a major third above No. 4; (6) an overtone a minor third\r\nabove No. 5. There are others in still higher range but those\r\nindicated are easily demonstrated on the piano. For C they would be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Music illustration]\r\n\r\nExperiment I\r\n\r\nStep to your piano, noiselessly press and hold down the key of No. 2,\r\nthen strike the fundamental No. 1, with force and immediately release\r\nit. As a result No. 2 will sound clearly, and if your ears are keen\r\nyou will at the same time hear No. 6. In succession hold down the keys\r\nof 3, 4, 5, and 6, while you strike and release the fundamental No. 1.\r\nIf your piano is \"in tune\" you will probably hear No. 6 when holding\r\nthe key of any other note of the series.\r\n\r\nIn a musical tone of rich quality the overtones just indicated are\r\npresent in their fulness, while tone that is weak and thin is made so\r\nby the absence or weakness of the overtones. I have stated that the\r\nquality of a tone depends on the _form_ of its vibrations, and that\r\nthe form of its vibrations is determined by the character of the\r\n_resonator_. We can now amplify this by saying that while the relative\r\npresence or absence of overtones determines the clang or color of a\r\ntone, their presence or absence is determined by the _character of the\r\nresonance_.\r\n\r\nAn English writer records that he was once in the garden at the back\r\nof a house while a gentleman was singing in the drawing-room. The\r\ntone-quality was good, and the pitch so unusually high he hastened to\r\nlearn who sang tenor high C so beautifully. On entering the room,\r\ninstead of the tenor he had supposed, he found the singer was a\r\nbaritone, and the note sung was only middle C. The fundamental tone\r\nhad not reached him in the garden but the first overtone, an octave\r\nabove it, had. Concrete illustrations will make the subject still\r\nclearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment II\r\n\r\nIf an ordinary tuning-fork when vibrating is held in the hand its\r\nintrinsic tone is too weak to carry far. Rest the handle of the\r\nvibrating fork on a bare table or the panel of the door, and the sound\r\nis greatly augmented. _The vibrations of the fork have by contact\r\ninduced similar vibrations in the wooden table or panel which\r\nreinforce the primary tone._\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment III\r\n\r\nPlace the handle of the vibrating tuning-fork on a small upturned\r\nempty box, or, better still, in contact with the body of a violin, and\r\nthe sound will be stronger than in the previous experiment, because to\r\nthe vibrations of the wood are added the vibrations of the air\r\nenclosed in the box or the violin. _To the resonance of the wood has\r\nbeen added the sympathetic resonance of the confined air._\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment IV\r\n\r\nHold the vibrating fork over the mouth of an empty fruit-jar and there\r\nwill probably be little or no reinforcement; but gently pour in water,\r\nthereby shortening the air column within the jar, and the sound of the\r\nfork will be gradually intensified until at a certain point it becomes\r\nquite loud. If you pour in still more water the sound will gradually\r\nbecome feebler. This shows that _for every tone an air column of a\r\ncertain size most powerfully reinforces that tone_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment V\r\n\r\nAs a sequence to the last experiment, take two fruit-jars of the same\r\nsize, and, having learned to what point to fill them for the greatest\r\nresonance, fill one jar (after warming it) to the required point with\r\nhot water, the other with cold water, and you will find that the\r\nresonance of the heated, therefore expanded, air is much less than the\r\ndenser air of the cold jar. This shows that _the degree of density of\r\nthe air affects its resonance_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment VI\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the resonance of the oral cavity, apart from the voice,\r\nhold a vibrating tuning-fork before the open mouth. Vary the shape and\r\nsize of the cavity until the sound of the fork suddenly increases in\r\nvolume, showing that the right adjustment for resonance has been made.\r\n_This intensification of the sound is due to the vibration of the air\r\nin the mouth cavity, together with the sympathetic vibration of the\r\nsurrounding walls._\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiment VII\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of sympathetic resonance without contact, sing\r\nforcibly a tone that is within easy range, and at the same time\r\nsilently hold down the corresponding key of the piano. On ceasing to\r\nsing you will hear the tone sounding in the piano. This may be further\r\nillustrated by playing on the open string of one violin while another,\r\ntuned to the same pitch, rests untouched near by. Through _sympathetic\r\nresonance_ the corresponding string of the second violin will vibrate\r\nand sound its note. The louder the first violin is played the louder\r\nwill be the sympathetic tone of the second.\r\n\r\nThe deep pedal-tones of a church organ often induce sympathetic\r\nresonance that may be felt beneath the feet of the listener. One\r\nwriter, a singer, speaks of living in the same house with two\r\ndeaf-mutes. He lodged on the first floor, they on the third. One day,\r\nmeeting at luncheon, one of the deaf-mutes told the singer that he had\r\nbegun practice earlier that morning than usual. Surprised, the writer\r\nasked how he knew. The deaf-mute replied that they always knew when he\r\nwas singing because they felt the floor of their room vibrate.\r\n\r\nIf tone vibrations can be transmitted so readily throughout a house,\r\nit is not difficult to understand how easily the vibrations of bone\r\nand tissue can be transmitted until the whole framework of the body\r\nresponds in perceptible vibration.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Pascal at the age of twelve wrote a dissertation on\r\nacoustics suggested by his childish discovery that when a metal dish\r\nwas struck by a knife the resulting sound could be stopped by touching\r\nthe vibrating dish with a finger.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind it is not difficult to understand how compression of\r\nthe human instrument by the pressure of tight clothing without, or by\r\nfalse muscular tension within, must interfere with its free vibration\r\nand so rob the produced tone of just so much of perfection.\r\n\r\nFrom these experiments we can understand that, while the tones of the\r\nvoice are initiated by or at the vocal cords, the volume and character\r\nof the tones are dependent upon _resonance_,--the vibration of the air\r\nin the various resonance chambers of the body, together with the\r\nsympathetic vibration of the walls of these chambers and the bony\r\nframework that supports them.\r\n\r\nIn respect to resonance, as in other respects, the human voice is far\r\nsuperior to all other instruments, for their resonators are fixed and\r\nunchanging, while the human resonator is flexible,--in Helmholtz's\r\nwords \"admits of much variety of form, so that many more qualities of\r\ntone can be thus produced than on any instrument of artificial\r\nconstruction.\"\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to realize the error of the common notion that\r\nloudness of tone is due entirely to increase of breath pressure on the\r\nvocal cords. Simple experiments with the tuning-fork have shown that\r\nwhile the volume of sound it gives forth is due in part to the\r\namplitude of its vibrations, its loudness is _chiefly_ due to the\r\ncharacter of the _resonance_ provided for it.\r\n\r\nThe larger the resonance chamber the greater is its reinforcing\r\ncapacity. The largest air chamber in the body is the chest, which\r\nserves not only as a wind-chest, but as a resonance chamber. The\r\nnecessity for chest expansion, therefore, is not, as generally\r\nsupposed, merely for air, but to increase its size as a resonance\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nIn view of the laws of tone, how great is the common error of speaking\r\nof the larynx as if it alone were the vocal organ, when the principal\r\nvibrations are _above_ the vocal cords in the chambers of _resonance_!\r\n\r\nSince the musical value, the beauty of tone, as well as its volume,\r\ncomes only from right use of the resonator, our principal business\r\nmust be the acquiring control of the vibratory air current _above the\r\nlarynx_. The acquirement of this control involves the proper focusing\r\nor placing of the tone, with the free uncramped use of all the vocal\r\norgans; power will then take care of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nHEAD AND NASAL RESONANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four component factors in the production of speech and song,\r\nthe first, the _motor_, has been considered in Chapter III, and the\r\nsecond, the _vibrator_, in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nIn one respect there is marked contrast between these two factors.\r\nUntil right habits are so thoroughly formed that the singer's\r\nbreathing is automatically controlled, conscious effort is necessary,\r\nwhile the action of the vibrator, the vocal cords, is involuntary, not\r\nsubject to conscious control.\r\n\r\nThe subtle adjustments of the delicate mechanism of the larynx belong\r\nto the realm of reflex action--to a spontaneous activity that, left\r\nunhindered, does its part in perfect nicety.\r\n\r\nThe vocal cords must, in their action, be free from the disturbance of\r\nuncontrolled breath action below them, or the hindrance due to\r\nmisdirected effort above them. To direct consciousness to the vocal\r\ncords is to cramp them and prevent that free vibration and that\r\nperfect relaxation of the throat without which pure tone and true\r\npitch are impossible.\r\n\r\nAs a surgeon I well know the value of thorough anatomical knowledge,\r\nbut from the singer's standpoint I cannot too strongly emphasize the\r\nunwisdom of directing the attention of sensitively organized pupils to\r\ntheir vocal mechanism by means of the laryngoscope. This instrument\r\nbelongs to the physician, not to the singer.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the third factor, the _resonator_, has been\r\nconsidered in Chapter V, on Resonance, but the fourth element in voice\r\nproduction, _articulation_, is so coördinated to resonance that the\r\nsignificance and primacy of the latter are too often overlooked.\r\n\r\nPlacing or \"focusing the voice\" I have found to be chiefly a matter\r\nof control and use of the resonator, consisting of chest, pharynx,\r\nmouth, and the nasal and head cavities.\r\n\r\nA tone lacking in resonance is ineffective,--devoid of carrying\r\npower,--is diffuse and unfocused; while a resonant tone, no matter how\r\nsoft dynamically, has carrying power and is focused in its vibration.\r\n\r\nNow \"voice placing\" depends primarily on correct _vowel placing_,\r\nwhich in turn depends on proper adjustment of the resonators, which\r\nagain depends chiefly on the positions and motions of the organs of\r\narticulation. The interdependence of tone quality and pronunciation is\r\ntherefore obvious.\r\n\r\nConstant emphasis must be laid upon the fact that focusing a tone is a\r\nmatter of resonance, and that perhaps the most important element in\r\nthis is _nasal_ resonance. In this country, particularly, teachers\r\nhave, in their desire to overcome the too common nasal twang,\r\nmistakenly sought to shut out the nasal chamber from all participation\r\nin speech and song.\r\n\r\nThere are those who, partly recognizing the importance of _head_\r\nresonance, would secure it while ignoring _nasal_ resonance. It is\r\nimpossible to secure head resonance in this fashion, for it is only\r\nthrough free nasal resonance that the coördinate resonance in the air\r\nsinuses above the nasal cavity and connected with it can be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe fear of nasal twang and failure to distinguish between it and true\r\nnasal resonance has been the stumbling block. They are very\r\ndifferent,--one is to be shunned, the other to be cultivated. The\r\nfirst is an obvious blemish, the second is an important essential of\r\ngood singing.\r\n\r\nNasal tones are caused by a raised or stiffened tongue, a sagging soft\r\npalate, a stiffened jaw, or by other rigidities that prevent free tone\r\nemission and which at the same time--note this--prevent true nasal\r\nresonance.\r\n\r\nAs tone, or vocalized breath, issues from the larynx, it is divided\r\ninto two streams or currents by the pendent veil of the soft palate.\r\nOne stream flows directly into the mouth, where it produces oral\r\nresonance; the other stream passes through the nasopharynx into the\r\nhollow chambers of the face and head, inducing nasal and head\r\nresonance.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that tone passing in whole or in part through\r\nthe nasal cavities must be nasal in quality; whereas a tone of\r\nobjectionable nasal quality can be sung equally well with the nostrils\r\neither closed or open.\r\n\r\nBrowne and Behnke state the matter thus: \"However tight the closure of\r\nthe soft palate may be, it is never sufficient to prevent the air in\r\nthe nasal cavities being thrown into co-vibrations with that in the\r\nmouth. These co-vibrations are, in fact, necessary for a certain\r\namount of the brilliancy of the voice, and if they are prevented by a\r\nstoppage of the posterior openings of the nasal passages, the voice\r\nwill sound dull and muffled. This is of course due, to an _absence of\r\nnasal resonance_, and must on no account be described as nasal\r\n_twang_. It is, indeed, the very opposite of it.\"\r\n\r\nNasal tone quality and nasal resonance must not be confounded. A nasal\r\ntone is constricted, while a tone with nasal resonance is free. Again,\r\na tone may be unmarred by the nasal quality, yet if it lacks nasal\r\nresonance it lacks vibrancy, carrying power.\r\n\r\nNasal tones are produced, not because the vibrations pass through the\r\nnasal passage, but because they are obstructed in their passage\r\nthrough them. A nasal tone is always a cramped tone, due to\r\nimpediment, tension, or muscular contraction, particularly in the\r\nnasopharynx.\r\n\r\nThe congestion and consequent thickening of the mucous membrane lining\r\nthe cavities of the nose and head, resulting from a cold, make the\r\ntone muffled and weak, owing to the inability of the parts to respond\r\nto the vibrations and add to the tone normal nasal resonance.\r\n\r\nThe elder Booth (Junius Brutus), about 1838, suffered from a broken\r\nnose which defaced his handsome visage and spoiled his splendid voice.\r\nHis disability was so great that afterward he seldom played. That the\r\ncause of this impairment of Booth's voice was due to the contraction\r\nand more or less complete obstruction of the nasal passages is too\r\nevident to call for comment.\r\n\r\nMany singers have sweet but characterless voices that lack the\r\nfulness, power, and ring they might have because they fail to avail\r\nthemselves of the augmenting power of the resonance cavities. The\r\nsinger must learn to habitually use all of the resonance cavities and\r\nuse them simultaneously.\r\n\r\nLilli Lehmann, in _How to Sing_, says that, \"although the nasal sound\r\ncan be exaggerated,--which rarely happens,--it can be much\r\nneglected,--something that very often happens.\" The context makes\r\nclear that what in the English translation of the great singer's book\r\nis called \"nasal sound\" is exactly what we term _nasal resonance_.\r\n\r\nAfter charging the monotonous quality or lack of color in the voice of\r\na famous opera star to lack of nasal resonance, Madame Lehmann speaks\r\nof the consummate art of Marcella Sembrich who \"in recent years\r\nappears to have devoted very special study to nasal resonance, whereby\r\nher voice, especially in the middle register, has gained greatly in\r\nwarmth.\" She says further that nasal resonance \"cannot be studied\r\nenough. It ought always to be employed.\" \"How often,\" she says, \"have\r\nI heard young singers say, 'I no longer have the power to respond to\r\nthe demands made upon me,' whereas the trouble lies only in the\r\ninsufficient use of the resonance of the head cavities.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, the conclusion follows that the head vibrations\r\nare not only an essential element, but that nasal resonance is a most\r\nimportant element in imparting to tone its brilliance and carrying\r\npower. Without thought of the mechanism of _how_ nasal resonance is\r\nproduced, the singer has control over it by direct influence of the\r\nwill. The tones, low as well as high, should seem to start in the nose\r\nand head, and the vibrations of the perfect tone can be plainly felt\r\nupon any part of the nose and head. Without the head vibrations no\r\ntone can be perfect, for nothing else will compensate for the lack of\r\nthese. Vocal organs used as here described will suffer no fatigue\r\nfrom reasonable use; hoarseness will be to them a thing unknown, and\r\n\"minister's sore throat\" an unheard of complaint. Not only is faulty\r\nvoice production a source of great discomfort, but it is the cause of\r\nmany diseases of the chest, throat, and head.\r\n\r\nThe gentle practice in easy range of the exercises given in the\r\nchapter following, will do much to restore a normal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPLACING THE VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is called \"placing the voice\" or \"tone production\" or \"focusing\r\nthe voice\" is, as already stated in the previous chapter, chiefly a\r\nmatter of resonance--of control of the resonator. Now vocalization is\r\nlargely vowelization, and vocal tones are a complex of sound and\r\nresonance. The character of a vowel is given it by the shape of the\r\nvowel chamber; and the shaping of the vowel chamber depends upon\r\ndelicate adjustment of the movable parts,--jaw, lips, cheeks, tongue,\r\nveil of the palate, and pharynx. While this adjustment is made through\r\nmore or less conscious muscular action, the parts must never be forced\r\ninto position; local effort to this end will invariably defeat itself.\r\nThe important consideration in all voice movements is a flexible,\r\n_natural_ action of all the parts, and all the voice movements are so\r\nclosely allied, so sympathetically related, that if one movement is\r\nconstrained the others cannot be free. It is a happy fact that _the\r\nright way is the easiest way_, and a fundamental truth that =right\r\neffort is the result of right thought=. From these axiomatic principles\r\nwe deduce the very first rule for the singer and speaker,--=THINK the\r\nright tone, mentally picture it; then concentrate upon the picture,\r\nnot upon the mechanism=.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN IS THE VOCAL ACTION CORRECT?\r\n\r\nThere are two sound criterions for judging the correctness of vocal\r\naction,--first, the _ease_ of the action, its naturalness, its\r\nflexibility. As Mills concisely states it: \"He sings or speaks best\r\nwho attains the end with the least expenditure of energy.\" Second, the\r\n_beauty_ of the result. Harsh, unlovely tones are a sure indication of\r\nmisplaced effort, of tension somewhere, of wrong action. On the other\r\nhand the nearer the tones approach to perfection the closer does the\r\norganism come to correct action. _Beauty of tone_, then, is the truest\r\nindication of proper vocal action.\r\n\r\nJudgment as to the relative beauty of a tone depends on the training\r\nof the ear. Pupils should habitually listen to their own voices, for\r\nbetween the hearing and feeling of the voice a knowledge of progress\r\ncan be obtained. The function of the ear in governing voice production\r\nis thus stated by Prof. Mills: \"The nervous impulses that pass from\r\nthe ear to the brain are the most important guides in determining the\r\nnecessary movements.\" Mr. Ffrangcon-Davies maintains that, \"The\r\ntraining of the ear is one-half of the training of the voice.\" The\r\nstudent should improve every opportunity to hear the best singers and\r\nspeakers, for both consciously and unconsciously we learn much by\r\nimitation. Good examples are often our best teachers.\r\n\r\nKeeping well in mind the principles stated above, we are now ready to\r\nbegin their application in placing the voice--that is, in setting it\r\nfree--not by learning some strange and difficult action, but by\r\ncultivating normal action.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES FOR PRACTICE\r\n\r\nThe following exercises are designed for the primary development of a\r\ncorrect tone and for the test of the perfection of every tone at every\r\nstage of development. They are based upon the assumption that all\r\ntones of the voice should be focused and delivered precisely alike.\r\nTheir use should constitute a part of the daily practice of the singer\r\nor speaker.\r\n\r\nI give but few exercises for each point to be gained. Intelligent\r\nteachers and pupils will add an infinite variety to suit each case,\r\nbut the exercises given appear to me to be the best for initial\r\npractice. It is important that each exercise in its order shall be\r\nthoroughly mastered before taking up the next. Only in this way can\r\nrapid progress be made, for it is not the multiplicity of exercises,\r\nbut the thoughtful application of principles in the few, that leads to\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe sound of _hng_ will always place the voice in proper focus by\r\ndeveloping the resonance of the nose and head. The thin bones of the\r\nnose will first respond to the sound and after practice the vibrations\r\ncan be felt on any part of the head and even more distinctly on the\r\nlow than on the high tones. To attain this, repeat the sound _hung_\r\ntimes without number, prolonging the _ng_ sound at least four counts.\r\nTo insure the proper course of the vowel sounds through the nasal\r\npassages, follow _hung_ with the vowel _ee_, as this vowel is more\r\neasily focused than any other; then with _oo_, _oh_, _aw_ and _ah_.\r\n\r\n_Ah_ is by far the most difficult sound to focus and should never be\r\nused for initial practice. Much valuable time has been lost by the\r\ncustom of using this sound at first. It should come last.\r\n\r\nThe _h_ is chosen to introduce the vowel sound because in the\r\npreparation to produce the sound of the letter _h_ the epiglottis is\r\nwide open and the vocal cords entirely relaxed, and because less\r\nchange of the tongue is required when the vowel sound follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreliminary Exercise\r\n\r\n_Practise this softly on any pitch easy for the voice._\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee. Hung-oo. Hung-oh. Hung-aw. Hung-ah.\r\nHung-ee _etc._]\r\n\r\nBegin the tone quietly on an easy pitch and continue it softly to the\r\nend. Later, after these exercises are mastered on one pitch, use every\r\nnote within the easy compass of the voice. Leave stridency of tone to\r\nthe locust. It is no part of a perfect tone. It never appeared in the\r\nvoices of the most famous singers. Those who allowed themselves to use\r\nit passed off the stage early in life. Much better results will be\r\nobtained by practising without any accompaniment. The sound of the\r\npiano or other instrument distracts the pupil, prevents both pupil and\r\nteacher from hearing the voice, and hinders progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT DIRECTIONS\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Exercise I and those that follow is practised is\r\nof the utmost importance. Therefore carefully note and apply the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. Fully pronounce the word _hung_ (_u_ as in _stung_) at once, and\r\nprolong the tone, not on the vowel sound but on the _ng_ sound. This\r\nestablishes the proper head and nasal resonance at the very beginning\r\nof the exercise.\r\n\r\n2. In passing from _ng_ to _ee_ be very careful not to change the\r\ninitial focus or lose the sensation of nasal and head resonance. Do\r\nnot therefore move the lips or the chin. The only change at this point\r\nis the slight movement of the tongue required to pronounce _ee_, which\r\nmust be a pure vowel without a trace of the preceding _g_.\r\n\r\n3. In passing from _ee_ to _oo_, from _oo_ to _oh_, and so on, do so\r\nwith the least possible movement of lips and chin. _The initial\r\nsensation of nasal and head resonance must not be lost._\r\n\r\n4. Each vowel sound must be distinct in enunciation and pure in\r\nquality. Avoid blurring one with the other. Give each its true\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\n5. As jewels of different hue hung on a string, so must this exercise\r\nbe the stringing of vowels on a continuous stream of sound.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise I\r\n\r\nTO ESTABLISH NASAL AND HEAD RESONANCE\r\n\r\nThis is an exercise for focusing or placing the voice and developing\r\nthe vibrations of the nasal and head cavities, the most essential\r\nparts of the resonant apparatus. If the nostrils are kept fully open,\r\nno nasal twang will be heard. The strength of the tone will correspond\r\nto the force of the vibrations of the nose and head, which can be\r\nplainly felt by resting the finger lightly upon the side of the nose.\r\nThe vibrations may eventually be plainly felt on the top and back of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\nAttack, that is, begin the tone, _softly_ and on no account force it\r\nin the least. Pronounce the full word _at once_, prolong the _ng_ four\r\ncounts as indicated, and sing the five vowel sounds on a continuous,\r\nunbroken tone. Articulate entirely with the lips and without moving\r\nthe under jaw. In this, as in the following exercises, keep the under\r\njaw relaxed and open the mouth so as to separate the teeth as wide\r\napart as is consistent with the action of the lips. See also the\r\nillustrations of proper lip position given at the close of Chapter II.\r\n\r\n_Practice this exercise on any pitch easy for the voice._\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\nRepeat this many times until the nose and head vibrations are fully\r\nrecognized and established. After mastery of this exercise is\r\nacquired, any words ending in _ng_ may be repeated. The word _noon_\r\nsung quietly on each note of the voice with the final consonant\r\nprolonged will be found helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES FOR SPEAKERS\r\n\r\nWhen the placing of the voice is accomplished on the one tone\r\n(Exercise I), the speaker can go on with practice in reading and\r\nreciting, allowing the voice to change its pitch at its will, only\r\nbeing careful that all the tones are alike in quality.\r\n\r\nA profitable exercise for speakers is to pronounce any word or\r\nsyllable ending with _ng_, as _ming_, _bing_, _sing_, _ring_, _ting_,\r\nand follow it with some familiar lines in a monotone, being sure that\r\nthe tone is the same and produces the same vibrations in the nose and\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a person already a public speaker, this new _régime_\r\nmay not immediately manifest itself in performance, but gradually the\r\nright principles will assume control, and speaking be done with ease\r\nand effectiveness. Continual daily practice of exercises should be\r\nkept up.\r\n\r\nIf a speaker has a musical ear and some musical knowledge, he will\r\nderive great benefit by following out the practice of the exercises\r\nfor singers. In no way can the voice for speaking be improved so\r\nrapidly or decisively as by musical training.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise II\r\n\r\nTO ESTABLISH HEAD AND NASAL RESONANCE\r\n\r\nAs in Exercise I, sing softly, seeking purity of vowel sounds and\r\nquality of tone. Fully pronounce _hung_ at once, prolonging the _ng_\r\nfour counts as indicated. Pass from one vowel to the next with the\r\nleast possible change in the position of the lips and chin. The stream\r\nof sound is to be unbroken, the tone focus unchanged, and the\r\nsensation of resonance in the upper chambers continuous.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise III\r\n\r\nUPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED\r\n\r\nFollow the directions for Exercise I. Sing quietly in a pitch that is\r\neasy for the voice, and modulate up or down by half steps.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise IV\r\n\r\nUPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED\r\n\r\nThe last exercise carried the voice an interval of a third; this\r\ncarries the voice an interval of a fifth. Follow carefully the\r\ndirections of Exercise I. Be sure to pronounce _hung_ at once,\r\nprolonging the tone not on the vowel but on the _ng_. _Sing softly._\r\nVary the pitch to suit the voice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise V\r\n\r\nUPPER RESONANCE CONTINUED\r\n\r\nThe last exercise carried the voice an interval of a fifth, this one\r\nhas a range of a sixth, while Exercise VI has a range of an octave.\r\nCarefully follow the Important Directions on page 60.\r\n\r\n_Sing softly_ in a pitch that is easy for the voice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise VI\r\n\r\nTO ENLARGE THE THROAT AND THUS MAGNIFY THE TONE\r\n\r\nPronounce the word _hung_ at once, opening the mouth well. Prolonging\r\nthe _ng_ sound as indicated will insure the proper focus.\r\n\r\nSing the five vowel sounds throughout the scale as indicated. At first\r\npractise only on scales that are in easy range.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5.

Simply change the tone into the vowel desired\r\nby the proper change in the articulating organs.\r\n\r\nSing the five vowel sounds connectedly, being sure that each vowel is\r\ncorrectly placed before passing to the next. The proper use of the\r\nlips will aid greatly in focusing the vowels. Start with the scale\r\nthat is in comfortable range.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Hung-ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise VIII\r\n\r\nTO ENLARGE THE THROAT AND FOCUS THE VOWELS\r\n\r\nOpen the mouth well and be sure that the vowel sounds are delivered as\r\nin the previous exercises; this will insure largeness with proper\r\nresonance.\r\n\r\nWhen practising this exercise, be careful, as with the others, that\r\neach vowel sound in its order is correctly given before passing to the\r\nnext. Only in this way can rapid progress be made.\r\n\r\nThe words _bing_, _sing_, _ting_, _fling_, _swing_ are excellent to\r\nuse for further practice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5. Hung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5. Hung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise IX\r\n\r\nQUICK CHANGING NOTES WITHOUT CHANGING RESONANCE\r\n\r\nThe important point in this flexible exercise is to _keep the\r\nvowel-color, the focus or resonance, unchanged throughout the phrase_.\r\nBegin quietly, give the _ng_ freedom and the upper resonance will\r\nadjust itself. This phrase is longer than in previous exercises; be\r\nsure then that you still have breath at the end--breath enough to sing\r\nfurther. Sing quietly. Pitch the exercise to suit the voice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5. Hung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise X\r\n\r\nFOR AGILITY\r\n\r\nSing each vowel sound separately before passing to the next. Be sure\r\nto start each vowel sound in purity and maintain it without change.\r\nPitch the exercise to suit the voice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Ee\r\n2. Oo\r\n3. Oh\r\n4. Aw\r\n5. Ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\nFor variants on the above use as initial consonants _b_, _p_, _m_,\r\n_f_, _v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_, and _l_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise XI\r\n\r\nTO DEVELOP THE USE OF THE LIPS AND UNDER JAW\r\n\r\nWhen practising this exercise protrude the lips and raise them toward\r\nthe nose as far as possible; also make an effort to enlarge and widen\r\nthe nostrils. This exercise may be practised more quickly than the\r\npreceding, but never at the expense of clearness of vowel distinction.\r\nCarry the exercise higher or lower, and in different keys, to suit\r\nindividual voices. With a slight initial accent sing each two-measure\r\nsection smoothly as one phrase. Avoid accenting each separate vowel\r\nsound. To do so would produce a series of jerks.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\nAfter practising the above as written modify it as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Bee-boo-boh-baw-bah.\r\n 2. Pee-poo-poh-paw-pah.\r\n 3. Mee-moo-moh-maw-mah.\r\n 4. Fee-foo-foh-faw-fah.\r\n 5. Vee-voo-voh-vaw-vah.\r\n 6. Dee-doo-doh-daw-dah.\r\n 7. Kee-koo-koh-kaw-kah.\r\n 8. Nee-noo-noh-naw-nah.\r\n 9. Tee-too-toh-taw-tah.\r\n10. Lee-loo-loh-law-lah.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise XII\r\n\r\nFOR FACILITY AND QUICK VOWEL CHANGE\r\n\r\nBe careful not to blur the vowel sounds; each must be distinct and\r\npure, and the change from one to the next must be made with a minimum\r\nof effort and without disturbing the focus of the tone.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration: Ee-oo-oh-aw-ah _etc._]\r\n\r\nThe divisions (_a_ and _b_) of each of the above four variants may be\r\nregarded as distinct exercises or not. For further practice use as\r\ninitial consonants any or all of the following: _b_, _p_, _m_, _f_,\r\n_v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_, and _l_.\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise XIII\r\n\r\nASCENDING AND DESCENDING SCALE\r\n\r\nAs in the previous exercises practise quietly with unvarying focus and\r\naim to finish the phrase with breath unexhausted. Pitch the exercise\r\nto suit the voice.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\nHung-ee\r\nHung-oo\r\nHung-oh\r\nHung-aw\r\nHung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\n\r\nExercise XIV\r\n\r\nTHE LONG SCALE\r\n\r\nSing this scale exercise in medium range, without blurring either the\r\nvowel sounds or the notes.\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5. Hung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\n[Music illustration:\r\n\r\n1. Hung-ee\r\n2. Hung-oo\r\n3. Hung-oh\r\n4. Hung-aw\r\n5. Hung-ah\r\n\r\n_etc._]\r\n\r\nThe exercises thus far given have employed the five vowel sounds found\r\nmost helpful in gaining a free resonance. These should now be\r\nsupplemented by the use of _all_ the vowel sounds. It is obvious that\r\nunless the singer is at home with every vowel and on any pitch in his\r\nvocal range perfect pronunciation is impossible. In Chapter II a Scale\r\nof Vowel Sounds is given. For convenience it is repeated here:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n1  n_ee_\r\n2  n_i_t\r\n3  n_e_t\r\n4  n_a_y\r\n5  n_ai_r\r\n6  n_a_t\r\n7  n_i_gh\r\n8  N_a_h\r\n7' n_o_t\r\n6' n_a_w\r\n5' n_e_r\r\n4' n_u_t\r\n3' n_o_\r\n2' n_oo_k\r\n1' n_oo_.]\r\n\r\nHaving so far mastered the previous exercises as to establish a free\r\nhead and nasal resonance, take the Scale of Vowel Sounds and apply it\r\nto the now familiar exercises.\r\n\r\nNext, as suggested in Exercise X, use as initial consonants in\r\nconnection with the Vowel Scale the consonants _b_, _p_, _m_, _f_,\r\n_v_, _d_, _k_, _n_, _t_ and _l_.\r\n\r\nKeep before you the formula that articulation should _seem_ to be done\r\nentirely with and through the upper lip; _i.e._, the _thought_ should\r\nbe that the words are projected through the upper lip.\r\n\r\nWhen by practise of the exercises given the voice has been focused and\r\nresonance established without any instrument, scale exercises and\r\nsimple vocalises may be taken up with or without the piano.\r\n\r\nIn practising scales start each a semitone higher until the _easy\r\nlimit_ of the voice is reached, and no farther. Gain will be more\r\nrapid by working to deliver the tones within the voice's normal\r\ncompass. Then when occasional effort is made the organs will be found\r\nready to deliver the highest pitch of which the voice is capable.\r\n\r\nWhen sufficient progress has been made in mastering the execution of\r\nscales and easy vocalises, the pupil will be ready to begin the study\r\nof songs. If one foregoes the singing of songs during the few weeks\r\noccupied with primary lessons, results are obtained much more quickly.\r\n\r\nWhile practising exercises or songs the less the pianoforte is used,\r\nexcept to compare the pitch, the better. Such practice increases the\r\nconfidence of the performer. The instrument prevents the singer's\r\nlistening to the tone he is producing and judging of its\r\neffectiveness.\r\n\r\nPupils with high or very low voices may continue their practice higher\r\nor lower as the voice is soprano, or bass, or contralto, but much\r\npractice on the extremes of the voice is unadvisable. If pure tones\r\nare produced in the medium range of the voice the highest or lowest\r\ntones will be found ready when called for. Therefore practise the\r\nextremes of the voice only enough to know the limits of the voice and\r\nto be assured the tones are there.\r\n\r\nWhen the singer can perform the preceding simple exercises and know\r\nthat the tones are all focused, or placed and delivered, precisely\r\nalike, he is ready to practise any scale, down or up, and to execute\r\nany musical exercise or song for which he is intellectually fitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHROAT STIFFNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the most frequent obstacle to good singing, the difficulty\r\nwith which pupil and teacher most contend? Throat stiffness. What more\r\nthan anything else mars the singing of those we hear in drawing-rooms,\r\nchurches, and the concert room? Throat stiffness.\r\n\r\nThis is the vice that prevents true intonation, robs the voice of its\r\nexpressiveness, limits its range, lessens its flexibility, diminishes\r\nits volume, and makes true resonance impossible.\r\n\r\nThis great interferer not only lessens the beauty of any voice, but\r\ndirectly affects the organ itself. The muscles of the larynx are small\r\nand delicate, and the adjustments they make in singing are exceedingly\r\nfine. When, however, the voice user stiffens his throat, these\r\ndelicate muscles in their spontaneous effort to make the proper\r\nadjustments are compelled to contract with more than their normal\r\nstrength. Every increase in throat stiffness demands a corresponding\r\nincrease in muscle effort, an overexertion that persisted in must\r\nresult in injury to the organ itself. Such misuse of the voice is\r\nbound to show injurious results. Every throat specialist knows this,\r\nand an untold multitude of those who, beginning with promise, have had\r\nto give up singing as a career, learn it too late.\r\n\r\nSingers are so accustomed to the sound of their own voices as to be\r\nusually quite unconscious of their own throat stiffness, though they\r\nmay recognize it in their neighbor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately throat stiffness by its very nature tends to aggravate\r\nitself, to constantly increase while the voice becomes less and less\r\nresponsive to the singer's demands.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of contributing causes to throat stiffness, but the\r\nprincipal cause is _throat consciousness_ and misplaced effort, due\r\nlargely to current misconceptions regarding the voice. A common notion\r\nis that we sing with the throat, whereas we sing _through_ it. Akin to\r\nthis error is the notion, as common as it is fallacious, that force of\r\ntone, carrying power, originates in the larynx, whereas the initial\r\ntone due to the vibration of the vocal cords is in itself\r\ncomparatively feeble. As shown at length in Chapters VI and VII,\r\nvolume of tone, its color and carrying power, is acoustically and\r\nvocally a matter of _resonance_.\r\n\r\nMany there are who sing by dint of sheer force and ignorance, but\r\ntheir careers are necessarily short. The too common vulgar striving\r\nfor power rather than for beauty or purity of tone induces unnatural\r\neffort and strain that both directly and sympathetically affect the\r\nthroat with stiffness.\r\n\r\nUnnatural effort in breathing, over-effort in breath control, as well\r\nas singing without adequate breath, all induce tension that is\r\nreflected at once in the sensitive throat.\r\n\r\nImpatience of results, American hurry, beget unnatural effort and\r\ntension. \"Unclasp the fingers of a rigid civilization from off your\r\nthroat.\" The student of the violin or the piano soon learns that only\r\nby a long and patient preparation can he fit himself to entertain even\r\nhis admiring friends. The embryo singer, on the contrary, expects with\r\nfar less expenditure of time and effort to appear in public.\r\n\r\nThe human voice is a direct expression of the man himself; it\r\nregisters spontaneously his mental and emotional states, even when he\r\nwould wish them hidden. Mental conditions tinged with impatience, with\r\nfear, or with anything that begets tension of any sort are reflected\r\ninstantly in the voice, robbing it of its better qualities and\r\ninducing stiffness in the throat.\r\n\r\nReduced to its lowest terms voice culture to-day is a struggle with\r\nthroat stiffness.\r\n\r\nThe causes indicate the remedy. Foremost, then, is dropping all throat\r\nconsciousness, all thought of the throat, all drawing of attention to\r\nit. The larynx must be left uncramped, unhindered to do its work in\r\nfree unconsciousness, which it will do if not disturbed by tension in\r\nits neighborhood, or by misdirected thought.\r\n\r\nThe stream of consciousness must in singing be directed to the\r\nbreathing which is below the throat, and to resonance and\r\npronunciation which are above it. These functions are more or less\r\nconsciously controlled until at last mastery makes their action\r\nautomatic.\r\n\r\nI would once more emphasize the fact that the free use of all the\r\nresonance chambers, and the recognition of the great function of\r\nresonance, will do more than anything else to set the voice free and\r\nemancipate the singer from all interfering rigidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nSOME GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL VOICE\r\n\r\nPupils are constantly urged to sing and speak naturally, because the\r\n\"natural\" tone is correct. This is exceedingly indefinite. It is\r\nnatural for a child to imitate the first sound it hears, whether it be\r\ncorrect or incorrect. In either case the child imitates it, and for\r\nthat child it becomes the natural tone. The child reared in the\r\nwilderness, beyond the hearing of a human voice, will imitate the\r\nnotes of the whip-poor-will, the chatter of the monkey, and the hoot\r\nof the owl, and for him they are natural tones.\r\n\r\nTo be natural is the hardest lesson to learn and it is only the result\r\nof imitation or prolonged discipline. Untrained naturalness is the\r\nperfection of awkwardness. The involuntary functions of organic life\r\nare the only ones naturally performed correctly. Nature's method of\r\nbreathing, circulation, and digestion can be depended upon until\r\ndisarranged by subsequent conditions, but unless proper vocalization\r\nis established by imitation and discipline this function is sure to be\r\ncorrupted by false examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE TO BEGIN\r\n\r\nAfter the child begins to talk, the sooner his vocal education begins\r\nthe better. Even at that early age he can be made to understand the\r\nmerits of head vibrations and by simple exercises produce them, and\r\nonce taught will never forget them. Vocalizing, like every other art,\r\nis most easily learned by imitation, and the advantage of the early\r\nyears, when that faculty is most active, should not be lost. In olden\r\ntimes the importance of this was fully realized. More than three\r\ncenturies ago, old Roger Ascham wrote: \"All languages, both learned\r\nand mother tongues, are begotten and gotten solely by imitation. For\r\nas ye used to hear so ye learn to speak. If ye hear no other, ye speak\r\nnot yourself; and of whom ye only hear, of them ye only learn.\"\r\nNineteen centuries ago Quintillian wrote: \"Before all let the nurses\r\nspeak properly. The boy will hear them first and will try to shape his\r\nwords by imitating them.\"\r\n\r\nIf the right way of using the voice is early taught it will be a guard\r\nagainst the contraction of bad habits which can only be corrected\r\nlater with infinite trouble. It certainly would be unwise to put a\r\nyoung child under continued training; but even in the kindergarten the\r\nright method of voice production can and should be taught. Teachers of\r\nkindergarten and primary schools should be familiar with the\r\nprinciples of voice training and be able to start the pupils at once\r\non the right road.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS\r\n\r\nThe sooner this branch of education is made a part of the curriculum\r\nof our common schools, the sooner shall we produce a race of good\r\nspeakers and singers.\r\n\r\nIf, during the pupil's school life, proper attention is paid to these\r\nprimary principles and to _correct articulation_, a large majority of\r\nstudents will graduate from our common schools prepared to advance in\r\nthe art of elocution or of singing without being obliged first to\r\nunlearn a vast amount of error and to correct a long list of bad\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nIf each day in the public schools a few minutes only are devoted to\r\nthe subject by a teacher who understands it and who will call the\r\nattention of the pupils to the proper applications of the principles\r\nin their daily recitations, it will be found amply sufficient to\r\ndevelop and establish a good speaking and singing voice.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTISTRY\r\n\r\nIf artistry is to be attained, every organ must be individually well\r\ntrained. Yet, during performance, no one part should be given undue\r\nprominence. The voice should be the product of all the organs equally\r\nwell developed. Continued practice will enable the performer to\r\ncorrelate the whole--blend the strength of all in one.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that no one in singing or speaking should\r\nappear to be governed by a \"method.\" During the early stages of\r\neducation, pupils should be amenable to rules and methods, but they\r\nmust not expect to be acceptable performers until able to forget their\r\nlessons and simply and unconsciously make use of all the advantages of\r\ntheir training. Even when the education is finished, and the _prima\r\ndonna_ has made her successful debut, continued daily repetition of\r\nprimary exercises is necessary to maintain excellence and insure the\r\nprogress that every performer desires. Our best singers to-day are as\r\ndiligent students of the technique of the voice as are the tyros\r\nstruggling with the first elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE'S PERIODS\r\n\r\nHuman life is divided into three periods: _first_, that of effort to\r\nget an education; _second_, of effort to maintain it; and _third_, of\r\neffort to resist the natural decline which comes with advancing years.\r\nThe singer and speaker must drill to develop the voice, must drill to\r\nkeep it in condition, and must drill to resist the encroachments of\r\nsenility. Eternal vigilance is the price of vocal success.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATION OF ESSENTIALS\r\n\r\nThe application of the principles here discussed will show that a\r\nmusical voice is not the product of mysterious systems, but a matter\r\nof scientific certainty. The essentials are good breathing, good\r\nfocusing, good resonance, and good articulation. These four elements\r\nare so interdependent that one cannot be perfected without the other.\r\nWith these attained, the intellect, the sentiment, and the emotion of\r\nthe performer will culminate in artistic excellence.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPOSE AS A PREPARATION FOR VOCAL EXERCISE\r\n\r\nThe nervousness or fear which manifests itself in constraint and\r\nrigidity of the muscles and sometimes in stage fright is a serious\r\nhindrance to progress. The effectual offset to this painful condition\r\nis repose.\r\n\r\nThe art of inducing a condition of repose can be readily acquired by\r\nany one who will carefully and faithfully do as follows: Place\r\nyourself in an easy lying or lounging position in a quiet place, with\r\nfresh air. Physical repose prepares for and invites mental repose. Now\r\nallow the mind to work care free at its own sweet will without any\r\nattempt to control it. Close the eyes and _breathe slowly, gently, and\r\ndeeply, with steady rhythm_. In two or three minutes a sensation of\r\nquiet restful repose will be experienced, which may be continued for\r\nseveral minutes or may even lead to a natural sound sleep.\r\n\r\nThis result may not be attained at the first or the second trial, but\r\na few repetitions of the exercise will insure success in almost every\r\ncase. After the art is attained in this formal way, ability to induce\r\nthe same repose when sitting upright, or while standing, will be\r\nquickly developed.\r\n\r\nThis repose is the fitting preparation for a lesson or a performance\r\nand may be induced during the progress of either, to allay any\r\ntrepidation incident to the situation. A mastery of this simple art\r\nwill make progress in the work of voice development much more rapid,\r\nand make attainable a degree of discipline that is impossible without\r\nit. It will prove for the beginner a sure prevention of stage fright\r\nand a great relief to the most chronic sufferer from this malady.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIBRATO\r\n\r\nThe _vibrato_ is a rhythmic pulsation of the voice. It often appears\r\nin untrained voices; in others it appears during the process of\r\ncultivation. Some have thought it the perfection of sympathetic\r\nquality; others esteem it a fault.\r\n\r\nThe vibrato is caused by an undulating variation of pitch or power,\r\noften both. The voice does not hold steadily and strictly to the\r\npitch, and according to the amount of the variation a corresponding\r\nvibrato, or tremolo, is produced.\r\n\r\nThe action of stringed instruments illustrates this statement. The\r\nfinger of the violinist vibrates on the string by rocking rapidly back\r\nand forth and the vibrato is the result.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the human instrument. By variation of the tension,\r\nthe vocal apparatus sends forth several tones in alternation, of a\r\nslightly different pitch, which together produce the effect.\r\n\r\nThree sources are ascribed for the vibrato; one is a rapid, spasmodic\r\nvibration of the diaphragm, causing variation of breath pressure;\r\nanother is the alternate tension and relaxation of the larynx and\r\nvocal cords; a third is that commonest of faults--throat stiffness.\r\nEither cause is possible, and variation in the pitch or intensity of\r\nthe tone is the result. Sufficient investigations have not been made\r\nto make the matter certain, but tremolo, trembling of the vocal\r\norgans, and muscular stiffness, or unnatural tension, seem to go\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible in the early stages of culture so to train the\r\nvoice as to use the vibrato or not at will, but if not early\r\ncontrolled this, like other bad habits, gains the mastery. Excessive\r\nvibrato has spoiled many good voices. It is not a fundamental quality\r\nof the voice. A little vibrato may occasionally be desirable when\r\nproperly and skilfully used; more than this is to be shunned as a\r\ndangerous vice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOLOGY OF VOCAL CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nMental conception precedes execution. The picture must exist in the\r\nartist's mind before it can be drawn on the canvas. The architect must\r\nmentally see the majestic cathedral in all its details before he can\r\ndraw the plans from which it can be built. In the field of physical\r\nactivity no movement is made until the mind has gone before and\r\nprepared the way. A person's ability to do is in a great degree\r\nmeasured by his determination to do, but sitting in a rocking-chair\r\nand thinking will never make an athlete. Mental action is necessary,\r\nbut only through trained muscular action can the mental action\r\nmaterialize in a finished performance.\r\n\r\nSo too the mind must anticipate the action of the vocal organs, but\r\nthe organs themselves must be led to interpret the mental concept\r\nuntil such action becomes spontaneous. Action in turn quickens the\r\nmental process, and the mental picture becomes more vivid.\r\n\r\nNote with emphasis that the mental concept _precedes_ the action and\r\ngoverns it. Therefore, instead of producing tone by local effort, by\r\nconscious muscular action of any sort, correctly _think the tone_,\r\ncorrectly shape and color it _mentally_. =Every vocal tone is a mental\r\nconcept made audible.= The beginner and the confirmed bungler alike\r\nfail in this prime essential--they do not make this mental picture of\r\ntone before singing it. Kindred to this is deficiency in hearing, in\r\ndiscriminating between good tone color and poor. The student must\r\nconstantly compare his tone as it is sung with the picture in his\r\nmind. Training the voice is therefore largely a training of mind and\r\near, a developing of nicety in discrimination. Singing is mental\r\nrather than physical, psychologic rather than physiologic. Think\r\ntherefore of the effect desired rather than of the process.\r\n\r\nIn considering the details of voice production analytically we are apt\r\nto forget that man, notwithstanding his complexity, is a _unit_ and\r\nacts as a unit. Back of all and underlying man's varied activity is\r\nthe psychical. In the advanced stages of the art of speech and song\r\nthis psychical element is of pre-eminent importance.\r\n\r\nThe speaker who essays to give expression to his own thoughts must\r\nhave his ideas sharply defined and aflame in order to so utter them\r\nthat they will arouse his hearers to enthusiasm. The speaker or singer\r\nwho would successfully interpret the thoughts of others must first\r\nmake those thoughts his very own. When this is attained, then the\r\nvoice, action, and the whole spirit of the performer, responding to\r\nthe theme, will beget a like responsiveness in his audience.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SINGER BEHIND THE VOICE\r\n\r\nBooks upon books have been written on voice training, and will\r\ncontinue to be written. The preceding pages have been devoted to the\r\nfundamental subject of tone production, but it is time to suggest that\r\nback of the voice and the song is the singer himself with his complex\r\npersonality. Back of the personality is the soul itself, forever\r\nseeking utterance through its mask of personality. All genuine impulse\r\nto sing is from the soul in its need for expression. Through\r\nexpression comes growth in soul consciousness and desire for greater\r\nand greater self-expression.\r\n\r\nSinging is far more than \"wind and muscle,\" for, as Ffrangcon-Davies\r\nputs it, \"The whole spiritual system, spirit, mind, sense, _soul_,\r\ntogether with the whole muscular system from feet to head, will be in\r\nthe wise man's singing, _and the whole man will be in the tone_.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the expressions of the human spirit in art form, the sublimated\r\nspeech we call song is the most direct. Every other art requires some\r\nmaterial medium for its transmission, and in music, subtlest of all\r\nthe arts, instruments are needed, except in singing only.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEDOM\r\n\r\nIn song the singer himself is the instrument of free and direct\r\nexpression. Freedom of expression, complete utterance, is prevented\r\nonly by the singer himself. No one hinders him, no one stands in the\r\nway but himself. The business of the teacher is to _set free_ that\r\nwhich is latent. His high calling is by wise guidance to help the\r\nsinger to get out of his own way, to cease standing in front of\r\nhimself. Technical training is not all in all. Simple recognition of\r\nthe existence of our powers is needed even more. Freedom comes through\r\nthe recognition and appropriation of inherent power; recognition comes\r\nfirst, the appropriation then follows simply. The novice does not know\r\nhis natural power, his birthright, and must be helped to find it,\r\nchiefly, however, by helping himself, by cognizing and re-cognizing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNo student of the most human of all arts--singing--need give up if he\r\nhas burning within him the _song impulse_, the _hunger to sing_. This\r\ninner impulse is by its strength an evidence of the power to sing; the\r\nvery hunger is a promise and a prophecy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERRENTS\r\n\r\nThe deterrents to beautiful singing are physical in appearance, but\r\nthese are outer signs of mental or emotional disturbance. Normal\r\npoise, which is strength, smilingly expresses itself in curves, in\r\ntones of beauty.\r\n\r\n_Mental discord_ results in angularity, rigidity, harshness.\r\n\r\n_Impatience_ produces feverishness that makes vocal poise impossible;\r\nand impatience induces the modern vice of forcing the tone. Growth is\r\na factor for which hurried forcing methods make no allowance.\r\n\r\n_Excess of emotion_ with its loss of balance affects the breathing and\r\nplay of the voice.\r\n\r\n_Exertion_, trying effort, instead of easy, happy activity induces\r\nhampering rigidities.\r\n\r\n_Intensity_, over-concentration, or rather false concentration,\r\nemotional tension, involves strain, and strain is always wrong.\r\n\r\n_Over-conscientiousness_, with its fussiness about petty detail, and\r\ninsistence on non-essentials, is a deterrent from which the robust are\r\nfree. _Over-attention to the mechanics_ of voice production is a\r\nkindred deterrent. Both deterrents prevent that prime characteristic\r\nof expression--spontaneity.\r\n\r\n_Anxiety_ is a great contractor of muscle, a great stiffener. Anxiety\r\nalways forgets the _power_ within, and falsely says to the\r\nsong-hunger, \"You shall never be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n_Self-repression_ is a great deterrent that afflicts the more\r\nsensitive, particularly those of puritanic inheritance. It is a\r\ndevitalizer and a direct negative to expression, which is vital, is\r\n_life_.\r\n\r\nAll of these deterrents are negative and may be overcome by fuller\r\nrecognition of the inner power that by its very nature must\r\nperpetually seek positive expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the student can perpetually find encouragement in a\r\nnumber of happy facts.\r\n\r\nMan is endowed by nature, except in rare instances, with a perfect\r\nvocal apparatus. When abnormal conditions are found they are usually\r\nin the adult voice, and are due solely to misuse. In other words\r\ndefects are not inherent but acquired and _can be removed_.\r\n\r\nBy nature the human voice is beautiful, for the tendency of nature is\r\nalways in the direction of beauty. Whatever is unlovely in singing, as\r\nin all else, is _un_natural. True method is therefore never artificial\r\nin its action, but simple, because the natural is always simple.\r\n\r\nFinally, no, not finally, but firstly and secondly and thirdly and\r\nperpetually, every student of singing and every teacher of it must\r\nconstantly bear in mind the happy law:\r\n\r\n=THE RIGHT WAY IS ALWAYS AN EASY WAY=\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\nTITLE                           AUTHOR                   PUBLISHED\r\n\r\nAn Essay on the History\r\nand Theory of Music, and\r\nof the Qualities and Capacity\r\nof the Human Voice              Isaac Nathan             London, 1823.\r\n\r\nElements of Vocal Science       Richard Mackenzie Bacon  London, 1824.\r\n\r\nOrthophony; or the Cultivation\r\nof the Voice in Elocution       William Russell          Boston, 1859.\r\n\r\nVocal Physiology                Charles Alex.
