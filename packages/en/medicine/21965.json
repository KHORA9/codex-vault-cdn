It can be beaten or\r\nsurpassed at almost every point by some product of the machine-shop or\r\nsome animal. It does almost nothing perfectly or with absolute\r\nprecision. As Huxley most unexpectedly remarked a score of years ago,\r\n\"If a manufacturer of optical instruments were to hand us for laboratory\r\nuse an instrument so full of defects and imperfections as the human eye,\r\nwe should promptly decline to accept it and return it to him. But,\" as\r\nhe went on to say, \"while the eye is inaccurate as a microscope,\r\nimperfect as a telescope, crude as a photographic camera, it is all of\r\nthese in one.\" In other words, like the body, while it does nothing\r\naccurately and perfectly, it does a dozen different things well enough\r\nfor practical purposes. It has the crowning merit, which overbalances\r\nall these minor defects, of being able to adapt itself to almost every\r\nconceivable change of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis is the keynote of the surviving power of the human species. It is\r\nnot enough that the body should be prepared to do good work under\r\nordinary conditions, but it must be capable, if needs be, of meeting\r\nextraordinary ones. It is not enough for the body to be able to take\r\ncare of itself, and preserve a fair degree of efficiency in health,\r\nunder what might be termed favorable or average circumstances, but it\r\nmust also be prepared to protect itself and regain its balance in\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe human automobile in its million-year endurance-run has had to learn\r\nto become self-repairing; and well has it learned its lesson. Not only,\r\nin the language of the old saw, is there \"a remedy for every evil under\r\nthe sun,\" but in at least eight cases out of ten that remedy will be\r\nfound within the body itself. Generations ago this self-balancing,\r\nself-repairing power was recognized by the more thoughtful fathers in\r\nmedicine and even dignified by a name in their pompous Latinity--the\r\n_vis medicatrix naturæ_, the healing power of nature.\r\n\r\nIn the new conception of disease, our drugs, our tonics, our\r\nprescriptions and treatments, are simply means of rousing this force\r\ninto activity, assisting its operations, or removing obstacles in its\r\nway. This remedial power does not imply any gift of prophecy on nature's\r\npart, nor is it proof of design, or beneficent intention. It is rather\r\none of those blind reactions to certain stimuli, tending to restore the\r\nbalance of the organism, much as that interesting, new scientific toy,\r\nthe gyroscope car, will respond to pressure exerted or weight placed\r\nupon one side by rising on that side, instead of tipping over. Let the\r\nonslaught of disease be sufficiently violent and unexpected, and nature\r\nwill fail to respond in any way.\r\n\r\nMoreover, we and our intelligences are a product of nature and a part\r\nof her remedial powers. So there is nothing in the slightest degree\r\nirrational or inconsistent in our attempting to assist in the process.\r\n\r\nHowever, a great, broad, consoling and fundamental fact remains: that in\r\na vast majority of diseases which attack humanity, under ninety per cent\r\nof the unfavorable influences which affect us, nature will effect a cure\r\nif not too much interfered with. As the old proverb has it, \"A man at\r\nforty is either a fool or a physician\"; and nature is a good deal over\r\nforty and has never been accused of lacking intelligence.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, nature must have acquired a fair knowledge of\r\npractical medicine, or at least a good working basis for it, from the\r\nfact that the body, in the natural processes of growth and activity, is\r\nperpetually manufacturing poisons for its own tissues.\r\n\r\nIn this age of sanitary reform, we are painfully aware that the most\r\nfrequent causes of human disease are the accumulations about us of the\r\nwaste products of our own kitchens, barns, and factories. The \"bad air\"\r\nwhich we hear so frequently and justly denounced as a cause of disease,\r\nis air which we have ourselves polluted. This same process has been\r\ngoing on within the body for millions of years. No sooner did three or\r\nfour cells begin to cling together, to form an organism, a body, than\r\nthe waste products of the cells in the interior of the group began to\r\nform a source of danger for the others. If some means of getting rid of\r\nthese could not be devised, the group would destroy itself, and the\r\nexperiment of coöperation, of colony-formation, of organization in fact,\r\nwould be a failure.\r\n\r\nHence, at a very early period we find the development of the rudiments\r\nof systems of body-sewerage, providing for the escape of waste poisons\r\nthrough the food-tube, through the kidneys, through the gills and lungs,\r\nthrough the sweat glands of the skin. So that when the body is\r\nconfronted by actual disease, it has all ready to its hand a remarkably\r\neffective and resourceful system of sanitary appliances--sewer-flushing,\r\ngarbage-burning, filtration. In fact, this is precisely what it does\r\nwhen attacked by poisons from without: it neutralizes and eliminates\r\nthem by the same methods which it has been practicing for millions of\r\nyears against poisons from within.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, such a painfully familiar and unheroic episode as an\r\nattack of colic. It makes little difference whether the attack is due to\r\nthe swallowing of some mineral poison, like lead or arsenic, or the\r\nirritating juice of some poisonous plant or herb, or to the every-day\r\naccident of including in the menu some article of diet which was\r\nbeginning to spoil or decay, and which contained the bacteria of\r\nputrefaction or their poisonous products. The reaction of defense is\r\npractically the same, varying only with the violence and the character\r\nof the poison. If the dose of poisonous substances be unusually large or\r\nvirulent, nature may short-circuit the whole attack by causing the\r\noutraged stomach to reject its contents. The power of \"playing Jonah\" is\r\na wonderful safety-valve.\r\n\r\nIf the poison be not sufficiently irritating thus to short-circuit its\r\nown career, it may get on into the intestines before the body thoroughly\r\nwakes up to its presence. This part of the food-tube being naturally\r\ngeared to discharge its contents downward, the simplest and easiest\r\nthing is to turn in a hurry call and cut down the normal schedule from\r\nhours to minutes, with the familiar result of an acute diarrh[oe]a.\r\n\r\nBoth vomiting and purging are defensive actions on nature's part,\r\nremedies instead of diseases. Yet we are continually regarding and\r\ntreating them as if they were diseases in themselves. Nothing could be\r\nmore irrational than to stop a diarrh[oe]a before it has accomplished\r\nits purpose. Intelligent physicians now assist it instead of trying to\r\ncheck it in its early stages; and paradoxical as it may sound, laxatives\r\nare often the best means of stopping it. It is only the excess of this\r\nform of nature's house-cleaning which needs to be checked. Many of the\r\npopular Colic Cures, Pain-Relievers, and \"Summer Cordials\" contain opium\r\nwhich, while it relieves the pain and stops the discharge, simply locks\r\nup in the system the very poisons which it was trying to get rid of.\r\nLaxatives, intestinal antiseptics, and bowel irrigations have almost\r\ntaken the place of opiates in the treatment of these conditions in\r\nmodern medicine. We try to help nature instead of thwarting her.\r\n\r\nSupposing that the poison be of more insidious form, a germ or a\r\nptomaine, for instance, which slips past these outer \"firing-out\"\r\ndefenses of the food-tube and arouses no suspicion of its presence until\r\nit has been partially digested and absorbed into the blood. Again,\r\nresourceful nature is ready with another line of defense. It was for a\r\nlong time a puzzle why every drop of the blood containing food and its\r\nproducts absorbed from the alimentary food-canal had to be carried,\r\noften by a most roundabout course, to and through the liver, before it\r\ncould reach any part of the general system. Here was the largest and\r\nmost striking organ in the body, and it was as puzzling as it was large.\r\nWe knew in some crude way that it \"made blood,\" that it prepared the\r\nfood-products for use by the body-cells, and that it secreted the bile;\r\nbut this latter secretion had little real digestive value, and the other\r\nchanges seemed hardly important enough to demand that every drop of the\r\nblood coming from the food-tube should pass through this custom-house.\r\nNow, however, we know that in addition to its other actions, the liver\r\nis a great poison-sponge or toxin-filter, for straining out of the blood\r\npoisonous or injurious materials absorbed from the food, and converting\r\nthem into harmless substances. It is astonishing what a quantity of\r\nthese poisons, whether from the food or from germs swallowed with it,\r\nthe liver is capable of dealing with--destroying them, converting them,\r\nand acting as an absolute barrier to their passage into the general\r\nsystem. But sometimes it is overwhelmed by appalling odds; some of the\r\ninvaders slip through its lines into the general circulation, producing\r\nheadache, backache, fever, and a \"dark-brown taste in the mouth\"; and,\r\nbehold, we are bilious, and proceed to blame the poor liver. We used to\r\npour in remedies to \"stir it up,\" to \"work on it\"--which was about as\r\nrational as whipping a horse when he is down, instead of cutting his\r\nharness or taking his load off. Nowadays we stop the supply of further\r\nfood-poisons by stopping eating, assist nature in sweeping out or\r\nneutralizing the enemies that are still in the alimentary canal, flush\r\nthe body with pure water, put it at rest--and trust the liver.\r\nBiliousness is a sign of an overworked liver. If it wasn't working at\r\nall, we shouldn't be bilious: we should be dead, or in a state of\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\nMoral: Don't rush for some remedy with which to club into insensibility\r\nevery symptom of disease as soon as it puts in an appearance. Give\r\nnature a little chance to show what she intends to do before attempting\r\nto stop her by dosing yourself with some pain-reliever or colic cure.\r\nDon't trust her too blindly, for the best of things may become bad in\r\nextremes, and the body may become so panic-stricken as to keep on\r\nthrowing overboard, not merely the poisons, but its necessary daily\r\nfood, if the process be allowed to continue too long.\r\n\r\nThis is where the doctor comes in. This is the point at which it takes\r\nbrains to succeed in the treatment of disease--to decide just how far\r\nnature knows what she is doing, even in her most violent expulsive\r\nmethods, and is to be helped; and just when she has lost her head, or\r\ngot into a bad habit, and must be thwarted. This much we feel sure of,\r\nand it is one of the keynotes of the attitude of modern medicine, that a\r\nlarge majority of the symptoms of disease are really nature's attempts\r\nto cure it.\r\n\r\nThis is admirably shown in our modern treatment of fevers. These we now\r\nknow to be due to the infection of the body by more or less definitely\r\nrecognized disease-germs or organisms. Fever is a complicated process,\r\nand we are still in the dark upon many points in regard to it, but we\r\nare coming more and more firmly to the conclusion that most of its\r\nsymptoms are a part of, or at least incidents in, the fight of the body\r\nagainst the invading army. The flushed and reddened skin is due to the\r\npumping of large quantities of blood through its mesh, in order that the\r\npoisons may be got rid of through the perspiration. The rapid pulse\r\nshows the vigor with which the heart is driving the blood around the\r\nbody, to have its poisons neutralized in the liver, burned up in the\r\nlungs, poured out by the kidneys and the skin. The quickened breathing\r\nis the putting on of more blast in the lung poison-crematory. It is\r\npossible that even the rise of temperature has an injurious effect upon\r\nthe invading germs or assists the body in their destruction.\r\n\r\nIn the past we have blindly fought all of these symptoms. We shut our\r\npatients up in stove-heated rooms with windows absolutely closed, for\r\nfear that they would \"catch cold.\" We took off the sheets and piled\r\nblankets upon the bed, setting a special watch to see that the wretched\r\nsufferer did not kick them off. We discouraged the drinking of water and\r\ninsisted on all drinks that were taken being hot or lukewarm. Nowadays\r\nall this is changed. We throw all the windows wide-open, and even put\r\nour patients out of doors to sleep in the open air, whether it be\r\ntyphoid, tuberculosis, or pneumonia; knowing that not only they will not\r\n\"catch cold,\" but that, as their hurried breathing indicates, they need\r\nall the oxygen they can possibly get, to burn up the poison poured out\r\nin the lungs and from the skin. We encourage the patient to drink all\r\nthe cool, pure water he will take, sometimes gallons in a day, knowing\r\nthat his thirst is an indication for flushing and flooding all the great\r\nsystems of the body sewers. Instead of smothering him in blankets, we\r\nput him into cold packs, or put him to soak in cool water.\r\n\r\nIn short, we trust nature instead of defying her, coöperate with her in\r\nplace of fighting her,--and we have cut down the death-rate of most\r\nfevers fifty to seventy-five per cent already. Plenty of pure, cool\r\nwater internally, externally, and eternally, rest, fresh air, and\r\ncareful feeding, are the best febrifuges and antipyretics known to\r\nmodern medicine. All others are frauds and simply smother a symptom\r\nwithout relieving its cause, with the exception of quinine in malaria,\r\nmercury, and the various antitoxins in their appropriate diseases, which\r\nact directly upon the invading organism.\r\n\r\nUnderneath all this storm and stress of the fever paroxysm, nature is\r\nquietly at work elaborating her antidote. In some marvelous fashion,\r\nwhich we do not even yet fully understand, the cells of the body are\r\nproducing in ever-increasing quantities an _anti-body_, or _antitoxin_,\r\nwhich will unite with the toxin or poison produced by the hostile germs\r\nand render it entirely harmless. By a curious paradox of the process, it\r\ndoes not kill the germs themselves. It may not even stop their further\r\nmultiplication. Indeed, it utilizes part of their products in the\r\nformation of the antitoxin; but it domesticates them, as it were--turns\r\nthem from dangerous enemies into harmless guests.\r\n\r\nThe treaty between these germs and the body, however, is only of the\r\n\"most-favored-nation\" class; for let these tamed and harmless friends of\r\nthe family escape and enter the body of another human being, and they\r\nwill attack it as virulently as ever.\r\n\r\nNow, where and how did nature ever succeed in getting the rehearsal and\r\nthe practice necessary to build up such an extraordinary and complicated\r\nsystem of defense as this? Take your microscope and look at a drop of\r\nfluid from the mouth, the gums, the throat, the stomach, the bowels, and\r\nyou will find it simply swarming with bacteria, bacilli, and cocci, each\r\nspecies of which numbers its billions. There are thirty-three species\r\nwhich inhabit the mouth and gums alone! We are literally alive with\r\nthem; but most of them are absolutely harmless, and some of them\r\nprobably slightly helpful in the processes of digestion. In fevers and\r\ninfections the body merely applies to disease-germs the tricks which it\r\nhas learned in domesticating these millions of harmless vegetable\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nStill more curious--there is a distinct parallel between the method in\r\nwhich food-materials are split up and prepared for assimilation by the\r\nbody, and the method adopted in breaking up and neutralizing the toxins\r\nof disease-germs. It is now known that poisons are formed in the process\r\nof digesting and absorbing the simplest and most wholesome foods; and\r\nthe liver uses the skill which it has gained in dealing with these\r\n\"natural poisons\" in disposing of the toxins of germs.\r\n\r\nWhen a fever has run its course, as we now know nearly all infections\r\ndo, within periods ranging from three or four days to as many weeks, it\r\nsimply means that it has taken the liver and the other police-cells this\r\nlength of time to handle the rioters and turn them into peaceable and\r\nlaw-abiding, even though not well-disposed citizens. In this process the\r\nforces of law and order can be materially helped by skillful and\r\nintelligent coöperation. But it takes brains to do it and avoid doing\r\nmore harm than good. It requires far more intelligence on the part of\r\nthe doctor, the nurse, or the mother, skillfully to help nature than it\r\ndid blindly to fight her.\r\n\r\nThis is what doctors and nurses are trained for nowadays, and they are\r\nof use in the sick-room simply because they have devoted more time and\r\nmoney to the study of these complicated processes than you have. Don't\r\nimagine that calling in the doctor is going to interfere with the\r\nnatural course of the disease, or rob the patient of some chance he\r\nmight have had of recovering by himself. On the contrary, it will simply\r\ngive nature and the constitution of the patient a better chance in the\r\nstruggle, probably shorten it, and certainly make it less painful and\r\ndistressing.\r\n\r\nIf these symptoms of the summer fevers and fluxes are indicative of\r\nnature's attempts to cure, those of the winter's coughs and colds are no\r\nless clearly so. As we walk down the streets, we see staring at us in\r\nlarge letters from a billboard, \"_Stop that Cough! It is Killing you!_\"\r\nYet few things could be more obvious to even the feeblest intelligence,\r\nthan that this \"killing\" cough is simply an attempt on the part of the\r\nbody to expel and get rid of irritating materials in the upper\r\nair-passages. As long as your larynx and windpipe are inflamed or\r\ntickled by disease-germs or other poisons, your body will do its best to\r\nget rid of them by coughing, or, if they swarm on the mucous membrane of\r\nthe nose, by sneezing. To attempt to stop either coughing or sneezing\r\nwithout removing the cause is as irrational as putting out a\r\nswitch-light without closing the switch. Though this, like other\r\nremedial processes, may go to extremes and interfere with sleep, or\r\nupset the stomach, within reasonable limits one of the best things to do\r\nwhen you have a cold is to cough. When patients with severe\r\ninflammations of the lungs become too weak or too deeply narcotized to\r\ncough, then attacks of suffocation from the accumulation of mucus in the\r\nair-tubes are likely to occur at any time. Young children who cannot\r\ncough properly, not having got the mechanism properly organized as yet,\r\nhave much greater difficulty in keeping their bronchial tubes clear in\r\nbronchitis or pneumonia than have grown-ups. Most colds are infectious,\r\nlike the fevers, and like them run their course, after which the cough\r\nwill subside along with the rest of the symptoms. But simply stopping\r\nthe cough won't hasten the recovery. Most popular \"Cough-Cures\" benumb\r\nthe upper throat and stop the tickling; smother the symptoms without\r\ntouching the cause. Many contain opium and thus load the system with two\r\npoisons instead of one.\r\n\r\nLastly, in the realm of the nervous system, take that commonest of all\r\nills that afflict humanity--headache. Surely, this is not a curative\r\nsymptom or a blessing in disguise, or, if so, it is exceedingly well\r\ndisguised. And yet it unquestionably has a preventive purpose and\r\nmeaning. Pain, wherever found, is nature's abrupt command, \"Halt!\" her\r\nimperative order to stop. When you have obeyed that command, you have\r\ntaken the most important single step towards the cure. _A headache\r\nalways means something_--overwork, under-ventilation, eye-strain,\r\nunderfeeding, infection. Some error is being committed, some bad\r\nphysical habit is being dropped into. There are a dozen different\r\nremedies that will stop the pain, from opium and chloroform down to the\r\ncoal-tar remedies (phenacetin, acetanilid, etc.) and the bromides. But\r\nnot one of them \"cures,\" in the sense of doing anything toward removing\r\nthe cause. In fact, on the contrary they make the situation worse by\r\nenabling the sufferer to keep right on repeating the bad habit, deprived\r\nof nature's warning of the harm that he is doing to himself. As the\r\npenalties of this continued law-breaking pile up, he requires larger and\r\nlarger doses of the deadening drug, until finally he collapses, poisoned\r\neither by his own fatigue-products or by the drugs which he has been\r\ntaking to deaden him against their effect.\r\n\r\nIn fine, follow nature's hints whenever she gives them: treat pain by\r\nrest, infections by fresh air and cleanliness, the digestive\r\ndisturbances by avoiding their cause and helping the food-tube to flush\r\nitself clean; keep the skin clean, the muscles hard, and the stomach\r\nwell filled--and you will avoid nine-tenths of the evils which threaten\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\nThe essence of disease consists, not in either the kind or the degree of\r\nthe process concerned, but only in its relations to the general balance\r\nof activities of the organism, to its \"resulting in discomfort,\r\ninefficiency, or danger,\" as one of our best-known definitions has it.\r\nDisease, then, is not absolute, but purely relative; there is no single\r\ntissue-change, no group even of changes or of symptoms, of which we can\r\nsay, \"This is essentially morbid, this is everywhere and at all times\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\nOur attainment of any clear view of the essential nature of disease was\r\nfor a long time hindered, and is even still to some degree clogged, by\r\nthe standpoint from which we necessarily approached and still approach\r\nit, not for the study of the disease itself, but for the relief of its\r\nurgent symptoms. Disease presents itself as an enemy to attack, in the\r\nconcrete form of a patient to be cured; and our best efforts were for\r\ncenturies almost wasted in blind, and often irrational, attempts to\r\nremove symptoms in the shortest possible time, with the most powerful\r\nremedies at our disposal, often without any adequate knowledge whatever\r\nof the nature of the underlying condition whose symptoms we were\r\ncombating, or any suspicion that these might be nature's means of\r\nrelief, or that \"haply we should be found to fight against God.\" There\r\nwas sadly too much truth in Voltaire's bitter sneer, \"Doctors pour drugs\r\nof which they know little, into bodies of which they know less\"; and I\r\nfear the sting has not entirely gone out of it even in this day of\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, relative and non-essential as all our definitions now recognize\r\ndisease to be, it is far enough (God knows) from being a mere negative\r\nabstraction, a colorless \"error by defect.\" It has a ghastly\r\nindividuality and deadly concreteness,--nay, even a vindictive\r\naggressiveness, which have both fascinated and terrorized the\r\nimagination of the race in all ages. From the days of \"the angel of the\r\npestilence\" to the coming of the famine and the fever as unbidden guests\r\ninto the tent of Minnehaha; from \"the pestilence that walketh in\r\ndarkness\" to the plague that still \"stalks abroad\" in even the prosaic\r\ncolumns of our daily press, there has been an irresistible impression,\r\nnot merely of the positiveness, but even of the personality of disease.\r\nAnd no clear appreciation can possibly be had of our modern and rational\r\nconceptions of disease without at least a statement of the earlier\r\nconceptions growing out of this personifying tendency. Absurd as it may\r\nseem now, it was the legitimate ancestor of modern pathogeny, and still\r\nholds well-nigh undisputed sway over the popular mind, and much more\r\nthan could be desired over that of the profession.\r\n\r\nThe earliest conception of disease of which we have any record is, of\r\ncourse, the familiar Demon Theory. This is simply a mental magnification\r\nof the painfully personal, and even vindictive, impression produced upon\r\nthe mind of the savage by the ravages of disease. And certainly we of\r\nthe profession would be the last to blame him for jumping to such a\r\nconclusion. Who that has seen a fellow being quivering and chattering in\r\nthe chill-stage of a pernicious malarial seizure, or tossing and raving\r\nin the delirium of fever, or threatening to rupture his muscles and\r\nburst his eyes from their sockets in the convulsions of tetanus or\r\nuræmia, can wonder for a moment that the impression instinctively arose\r\nin the untutored mind of the Ojibwa that the sufferer was actually in\r\nthe grasp, and trying to escape from the clutch, of some malicious but\r\ninvisible power? And from this conception the treatment logically\r\nfollowed. The spirits which possessed the patient, although invisible,\r\nwere supposed to be of like passions with ourselves, and to be affected\r\nby very similar influences; hence dances, terrific noises, beatings and\r\nshakings of the unfortunate victim, and the administration of bitter and\r\nnauseous messes, with the hope of disgusting the demon with his\r\nquarters, were the chief remedies resorted to. And while to-day such\r\nconceptions and their resultant methods are simply grounds for laughter,\r\nand we should probably resent the very suggestion that there was any\r\nconnection whatever between the Demon Theory and our present practice,\r\nyet, unfortunately for our pride, the latter is not only the direct\r\nlineal, historic descendant of the former, but bears still abundant\r\ntraces of its lowly origin. It will, of course, be admitted at once that\r\nthe ancestors of our profession, historically, the earliest physicians,\r\nwere the priest, the Shaman, and the conjurer, who even to this day in\r\ncertain tribes bear the suggestive name of \"medicine men.\" Indeed, this\r\ngrotesque individual was neither priest nor physician, but the common\r\nancestor of both, and of the scientist as well. And, even if the history\r\nof this actual ancestry were unknown, there are scores of curious\r\nsurvivals in the medical practice of this century, even of to-day, which\r\ntestify to the powerful influence of this conception. The extraordinary\r\nand disgraceful prevalence of bleeding scarcely fifty years ago, for\r\ninstance; the murderous doses of calomel and other violent purges; the\r\nindiscriminate use of powerful emetics like tartar emetic and ipecac;\r\nthe universal practice of starving or \"reducing\" fevers by a diet of\r\nslops, were all obvious survivals of the expulsion-of-the-demon theory\r\nof treatment. Their chief virtue lay in their violence and\r\nrepulsiveness. Even to-day the tendency to regard mere bitterness or\r\ndistastefulness as a medicinal property in itself has not entirely died\r\nout. This is the chief claim of quassia, gentian, calumbo, and the\r\n\"simple bitters\" generally, to a place in our official lists of\r\nremedies. Even the great mineral-water fad, which continues to flourish\r\nso vigorously, owed its origin to the superstition that springs which\r\nbubbled or seethed were inhabited by spirits (of which the \"troubling of\r\nthe waters\" in the Pool of Bethesda is a familiar illustration). The\r\nbubble and (in both senses) \"infernal\" taste gave them their reputation,\r\nthe abundant use of pure spring water both internally and externally\r\nworks the cure, assisted by the mountain air of the \"_Bad_,\" and we\r\nsapiently ascribe the credit to the salts. Nine-tenths of our cells are\r\nstill submarine organisms, and water is our greatest panacea.\r\n\r\nThen came the great \"humoral\" or \"vital fluid\" theory of disease which\r\nruled during the Middle Ages. According to this, all disease was due to\r\nthe undue predominance in the body of one of the four great vital\r\nfluids,--the bile, the blood, the nervous \"fluid,\" and the lymph,--and\r\nmust be treated by administering the remedy which will get rid of or\r\ncounteract the excess of the particular vital fluid in the system. The\r\nprincipal traces of this belief are the superstition of the four\r\n\"temperaments,\" the _bilious_, the _sanguine_, the _nervous_, and the\r\n_lymphatic_, and our pet term \"biliousness,\" so useful in explaining any\r\nobscure condition.\r\n\r\nLast of all, in the fullness of time,--and an incredibly late fullness\r\nit was,--under the great pioneer Virchow, who died less than a decade\r\nago, was developed the great cellular theory, a theory which has done\r\nmore to put disease upon a rational basis, to substitute logic for\r\nfancy, and accurate reasoning for wild speculation, than almost any\r\ndiscovery since the dawn of history. Its keynote simply is, that every\r\ndisturbance to which the body is liable can be ultimately traced to some\r\ndisturbance or disease of the vital activities of the individual cells\r\nof which it is made up. The body is conceived of as a cell-state or\r\ncell-republic, composed of innumerable plastid citizens, and its\r\ngovernment, both in health and disease, is emphatically a government \"of\r\nthe cells, by the cells, for the cells.\" At first these cell-units were\r\nregarded simply as geographic sections, as it were, sub-divisions of the\r\ntissues, bearing much the same relation to the whole body as the bricks\r\nof the wall do to the building, or, from a little broader view, as the\r\nHessians of a given regiment to the entire army. They were merely the\r\ncreatures of the organism as a whole, its servants who lived but to obey\r\nits commands and carry out its purposes, directed in purely arbitrary\r\nand despotic fashion by the lordly brain and nerve-ganglia, which again\r\nare directed by the mind, and that again by a still higher power. In\r\nfact, they were regarded as, so to speak, individuals without\r\npersonality, mere slaves and helots under the ganglion-oligarchy which\r\nwas controlled by the tyrant mind, and he but the mouthpiece of one of\r\nthe Olympians. But time has changed all that, and already the triumphs\r\nof democracy have been as signal in biology as they have been in\r\npolitics, and far more rapid. The sturdy little citizen-cells have\r\nsteadily but surely fought their way to recognition as the controlling\r\npower of the entire body-politic, have forced the ganglion-oligarchy to\r\nadmit that they are but delegates, and even the tyrant mind to concede\r\nthat he rules by their sufferance alone. His power is mainly a veto, and\r\neven that may be overruled by the usual two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nIn fact, if we dared to presume to criticise this magnificent theory of\r\ndisease, we would simply say that it is not \"cellular\" enough, that it\r\nhardly as yet sufficiently recognizes the individuality, the\r\nindependence, the power of initiative, of the single constituent cell.\r\nIt is still a little too apt to assume, because a cell has donned a\r\nuniform and fallen into line with thousands of its fellows to form a\r\ntissue in most respects of somewhat lower rank than that originally\r\npossessed by it in its free condition, that it has therefore surrendered\r\nall of its rights and become a mere thing, a lever or a cog in the great\r\nmachine. Nothing could be further from the truth, and I firmly believe\r\nthat our clearest insight into and firmest grasp upon the problems of\r\npathology will come from a recognition of the fact that, no matter how\r\nstereotyped, or toil-worn, or even degraded, the individual cells of any\r\ntissue may have become, they still retain most of the rights and\r\nprivileges which they originally possessed in their free and untrammeled\r\nam[oe]boid stage, just as in the industrial community of the world about\r\nus. And, although their industry in behalf of and devotion to the\r\nwelfare of the entire organism is ever to be relied upon, and almost\r\npathetic in its intensity, yet it has its limits, and when these have\r\nbeen transgressed they are as ready to \"fight for their own hand,\"\r\nregardless of previous conventional allegiance, as ever were any of\r\ntheir ancestors on seashore or rivulet-marge. And such rebellions are\r\nour most terrible disease-processes, cancer and sarcoma. More than this:\r\nwhile, perhaps, in the majority of cases the cell does yeoman service\r\nfor the benefit of the body, in consideration of the rations and fuel\r\nissued to it by the latter, yet in many cases we have the curious, and\r\nat first sight almost humiliating, position of the cell absorbing and\r\ndigesting whatever is brought to it, and only turning over the surplus\r\nor waste to the body. It would almost seem as if our lordly _Ego_ was\r\nliving upon the waste-products, or leavings, of the cells lining its\r\nfood-tube.\r\n\r\nLet us take a brief glance at the various specializations and trade\r\ndevelopments, which have taken place in the different groups of cells,\r\nand see to what extent the profound modifications which many of them\r\nhave undergone are consistent with their individuality and independence,\r\nand also whether such specialization can be paralleled by actually\r\nseparate and independent organisms existing in animal communities\r\noutside of the body. First of all, because furthest from the type and\r\ndegraded to the lowest level, we find the great masses of tissue welded\r\ntogether by lime-salts, which form the foundation masses, leverage-bars,\r\nand protection plates for the higher tissues of the body. Here the\r\ncells, in consideration of food, warmth, and protection guaranteed to\r\nthemselves and their heirs for ever by the body-state, have, as it were,\r\ndeliberately surrendered their rights of volition, of movement, and\r\nhigher liberties generally, and transformed themselves into masses of\r\ninorganic material by soaking every thread of their tissues in\r\nlime-salts and burying themselves in a marble tomb. Like Esau, they have\r\nsold their birthright for a mess of \"potash,\" or rather lime; and if\r\nsuch a class or caste could be invented in the external industrial\r\ncommunity, the labor problem and the ever-occurring puzzle of the\r\nunemployed would be much simplified. And yet, petrified and mummified as\r\nthey have become, they are still emphatically alive, and upon the\r\npreservation of a fair degree of vigor in them depends entirely the\r\nstrength and resisting power of the mass in which they are embedded, and\r\nof which they form scarcely a third. Destroy the vitality of its cells,\r\nand the rock-like bone will waste away before the attack of the\r\nbody-fluids like soft sandstone under the elements. Shatter it, or twist\r\nit out of place, and it will promptly repair itself, and to a remarkable\r\ndegree resume its original directions and proportions.\r\n\r\nSo little is this form of change inconsistent with the preservation of\r\nindividualism, that we actually find outside of the body an exactly\r\nsimilar process, occurring in individual and independent animals, in the\r\nfamiliar drama of coral-building. The coral polyp saturates itself with\r\nthe lime-salts of the sea-water, much as the bone-corpuscles with those\r\nof the blood and lymph, and thus protects itself in life and becomes the\r\nflying buttress of a continent in death.\r\n\r\nIn the familiar connective-tissue, or \"binding-stuff,\" we find a process\r\nsimilar in kind but differing in the degree, so to speak, of its\r\ndegradation.\r\n\r\nThe quivering responsiveness of the protoplasm of the am[oe]boid\r\nancestral cell has transformed itself into tough, stringy bands and webs\r\nfor the purpose of binding together the more delicate tissues of the\r\nbody. It has retained more of its rights and privileges, and\r\nconsequently possesses a greater amount of both biological and\r\npathological initiative. In many respects purely mechanical in its\r\nfunction, fastening the muscles to the bones, the bones to each other,\r\ngiving toughness to the great skin-sheet, and swinging in hammock-like\r\nmesh the precious brain-cell or potent liver-lobule, it still possesses\r\nand exercises for the benefit of the body considerable powers of\r\ndiscretion and aggressive vital action. Through its activity chiefly is\r\ncarried out that miracle of human physiology, the process of repair. By\r\nthe transformation of its protoplasm the surplus food-materials of the\r\ntimes of plenty are stored away within its cell-wall against the time of\r\nstress.\r\n\r\nWhatever emergency may arise, nature, whatever other forces she may be\r\nunable to send to the rescue, can always depend upon the\r\nconnective-tissues to meet it; and, of course, as everywhere the medal\r\nof honor has its reverse side, their power for evil is as distinguished\r\nas their power for good. From their ranks are recruited a whole army of\r\nthose secessions from and rebellions against the body at large--the\r\ntumors, from the treacherous and deadly sarcoma, or \"soft cancer,\" to\r\nthe harmless fatty tumor, as well as the tubercle, the gumma of\r\nsyphilis, the interstitial fibrosis of Bright's disease. They are the\r\nsturdy farmers and ever ready \"minute-men\" of the cell-republic, and we\r\nfind their prototype and parallel in the external world, both in\r\nmaterial structure and degree of vitality, in the well-known sponge and\r\nits colonies.\r\n\r\nNext in order, and, in fact, really forming a branch of the last, we\r\nfind the great group of storage-tissues, the granaries or bankers of the\r\nbody-politic, distinguished primarily, like the capitalist class\r\nelsewhere, by an inordinate appetite, not to say greed. They sweep into\r\ntheir interior all the food-materials which are not absolutely necessary\r\nfor the performance of the vital function of the other cells. These they\r\nform first into protoplasm, and then by a simple degenerative process it\r\nis transformed, \"boiled down\" as it were, into a yellow hydrocarbon\r\nwhich is capable of storage for practically an indefinite period. Not a\r\nvery exalted function, and yet one of great importance to the welfare of\r\nthe entire body, for, like the Jews of the Middle Ages, the fat-cells,\r\npossessing an extraordinary appetite for and faculty of acquiring\r\nsurplus wealth in times of plenty, can easily be robbed of it and\r\nliterally sucked dry in times of scarcity by any other body-cell which\r\nhappens to need it, especially by the belligerent military class of\r\nmuscle-cells. In fever or famine, fat is the first element of our\r\nbody-mass to disappear; so that Proudhon would seem to have some\r\nbiological basis for his demand for the _per capita_ division of the\r\nfortunes of millionaires. And yet, rid the fat-cell of the weight of his\r\nsordid gains, gaunt him down, as it were, like a hound for the\r\nwolf-trail, and he becomes at once an active and aggressive member of\r\nthe binding-stuff group, ready for the repair of a wound or the barring\r\nout of a tubercle-bacillus.\r\n\r\nAnd this form of specialization has also its parallel outside of the\r\nbody in one of the classes in a community of Mexican ants, whose most\r\ndistinguishing feature is an enormously distended [oe]sophagus, capable\r\nof containing nearly double the weight of the entire remainder of the\r\nbody. They are neither soldiers nor laborers, but accompany the latter\r\nin their honey-gathering excursions, and as the spoils are collected\r\nthey are literally packed full of the sweets by the workers. When\r\ndistended to their utmost capacity they fall apparently into a\r\nsemi-comatose condition, are carried into the ant-hill, and hung up by\r\nthe hind legs in a specially prepared chamber, in which (we trust)\r\nenjoyable position and state they are left until their contents are\r\nneeded for the purposes of the community, when they are waked up,\r\ncompelled to disgorge, and resume their ordinary life activities until\r\nthe next season's honey-gathering begins. It scarcely need be pointed\r\nout what an unspeakable boon to the easily discouraged and unlucky the\r\nintroduction of such a class as this into the human industrial community\r\nwould be, especially if this method of storage could be employed for\r\ncertain liquids.\r\n\r\nAnother most important class in the cell-community is the great group\r\nof the blood-corpuscles, which in some respects appear to maintain their\r\nindependence and freedom to a greater degree than almost any other class\r\nwhich can be found in the body. While nearly all other cells have become\r\npacked or felted together so as to form a fixed and solid tissue, these\r\nstill remain entirely free and unattached. They float at large in the\r\nblood-current, much as their original ancestor, the am[oe]ba, did in the\r\nwater of the stagnant ditch. And, curiously enough, the less numerous of\r\nthe two great classes, the white, or leucocytes, are in appearance,\r\nstructure, pseudopodic movements, and even method of engulfing food,\r\nalmost exact replicas of their most primitive ancestor.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no fixed means of communication between the\r\nblood-corpuscles and the rest of the body, not even by the tiniest\r\nbranch of the great nerve-telegraph system, and yet they are the most\r\nloyal and devoted class among all the citizens of the cell-republic.\r\nThey are called hither and thither partly by messenger-substances thrown\r\ninto the blood, known as _hormones_, partly by the \"smell of the battle\r\nafar off,\" the toxins of inflammation and infection as they pour through\r\nthe blood.\r\n\r\nThe red ones lose their nuclei, their individuality, in order to become\r\nsponges, capable of saturating themselves with oxygen and carrying it to\r\nthe gasping tissues. The white are the great mounted police, the\r\nsanitary patrol of the body. The moment that the alarm of injury is\r\nsounded in a part, all the vessels leading to it dilate, and their\r\nchannels are crowded by swarms of the red and white hurrying to the\r\nscene. The major part of the activity of the red cells can be accounted\r\nfor by the mechanism of the heart and blood-vessels. They are simply\r\nthrown there by the handful and the shovelful, as it were, like so many\r\npebbles or bits of chalk.\r\n\r\nBut the behavior of the white cells goes far beyond this. We are almost\r\ntempted to endow them with volition, though they are of course drawn or\r\ndriven by chemical and physical attractions, like iron-filings by a\r\nmagnet, or an acid by a base. Not only do all those normally circulating\r\nin the blood flowing through the injured part promptly stop and begin to\r\nscatter themselves through the underbrush and attack the foe at close\r\nquarters, but, as has been shown by Cabot's studies in leucocytosis, the\r\nmoment that the red flag of fever is hoisted, or the inflammation alarm\r\nis sounded, the leucocytes come rushing out from their feeding-grounds\r\nin the tissue-interspaces, in the lymph-channels, in the great serous\r\ncavities, and pour themselves into the blood-stream, like minute-men\r\nleaving the plough and thronging the highways leading towards the\r\nfrontier fortress which has been attacked. Arrived at the spot, if there\r\nbe little of the pomp and pageantry of war in their movements, their\r\npractical devotion and heroism are simply unsurpassed anywhere, even in\r\nsong and story. They never think of waiting for reinforcements or for\r\norders from headquarters. They know only one thing, and that is to\r\nfight; and when the body has brought them to the spot, it has done all\r\nthat is needed, like the Turkish Government when once it has got its\r\nsturdy peasantry upon the battlefield: they have not even the sense to\r\nretreat. And whether they be present in tens, or in scores, or in\r\nmillions, each one hurls himself upon the toxin or bacillus which stands\r\ndirectly in front of him. If he can destroy the bacillus and survive, so\r\nmuch the better; but if not, he will simply overwhelm him by the weight\r\nof his body-mass, and be swept on through the blood-stream into the\r\ngreat body-sewers, with the still living bacillus literally buried in\r\nhis dead body. Like Arnold Winkelried, he will make his body a sheath\r\nfor a score of the enemy's spears, so that his fellows can rush in\r\nthrough the gap that he has made. And it makes no difference whatever if\r\nthe first ten or hundred or thousand are instantly mowed down by the\r\nbacillus or its deadly toxins, the rear ranks sweep forward without an\r\ninstant's hesitation, and pour on in a living torrent, like the Zulu\r\n_impis_ at Rorke's Drift, until the bacilli are battered down by the\r\nsheer impact of the bodies of their assailants, or smothered under the\r\npile of their corpses. When this has happened, in the language of the\r\nold surgeon-philosophers, \"suppuration is established,\" and the patient\r\nis saved.\r\n\r\nOr if, as often happens, an antitoxin is formed, which protects the\r\nwhole body, this is largely built out of substances set free from the\r\nbodies of slain leucocytes. And the only thing that dims our vision to\r\nthe wonder and beauty of this drama, is that it happens every day, and\r\nwe term it prosaically \"the process of repair,\" and expect it as a\r\nmatter of course. Every wound-healing is worthy of an epic, if we could\r\nonly look at it from the point of view of these citizens of our great\r\ncell-republic. And if we were to ask the question, \"Upon what does\r\ntheir peculiar value to the body-politic depend?\" we should find that it\r\nwas largely the extent to which they retained their ancestral\r\ncharacteristics. They are born in the lymph-nodes, which are simply\r\nlittle islands of tissue of embryonic type, preserved in the body\r\nlargely for the purpose of breeding this primitive type of cells. They\r\nare literally the Indian police, the scavengers, the Hibernians, as it\r\nwere, of the entire body. They have the roving habits and fighting\r\ninstincts of the savage. They cruise about continually through the\r\nwaterways and marshes of the body, looking for trouble, and, like their\r\nHibernian descendants, wherever they see a head they hit it. They are\r\nthe incarnation of the fighting spirit of our ancestors, and if it were\r\nnot for their retention of this characteristic in so high a degree, many\r\nclasses of our fixed cells would not have been able to subside into such\r\nburgher like habits.\r\n\r\nAlthough even here, as we shall see, it is only a question of quickness\r\nof response, for while the first bands of the enemy may be held at bay\r\nby the leucocyte cavalry, and a light attack repelled by their\r\nskirmish-line, yet when it comes to the heavy fighting of a\r\nfever-invasion, it is the slow but substantial burgher-like fixed cells\r\nof the body which form the real infantry masses of the campaign. And I\r\nbelieve that upon the proportional relation between these primitive and\r\ncivilized cells of our body-politic will depend many of the singular\r\ndifferences, not only in degree but also in kind, in the immunity\r\npossessed by various individuals. While some surgeons and anatomists\r\nwill show a temperature from the merest scratch, and yet either never\r\ndevelop any serious infection or display very high resisting power in\r\nthe later stages, others, again, will stand forty slight inoculations\r\nwith absolute impunity, and yet, when once the leucocyte-barrier is\r\nbroken down, will make apparently little resistance to a fatal systemic\r\ninfection. And this, of course, is only one of a score of ways in which\r\nthe leucocytes literally _pro patria moriuntur_. Our whole alimentary\r\ncanal is continually patrolled by their squadrons, poured into it by the\r\ntonsils above and Peyer's patches below; if it were not for them we\r\nshould probably be poisoned by the products of our own digestive\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the cells of the body-republic retain so much of their\r\nindependence and individuality in health, does it not seem highly\r\nprobable that they do also in disease? This is known to be the case\r\nalready in many morbid processes, and their number is being added to\r\nevery day. The normal activities of any cell carried to excess may\r\nconstitute disease, by disturbing the balance of the organism. Nay, most\r\ndisease-processes on careful examination are found to be at bottom\r\nvital, often normal to the cells concerned in them. The great normal\r\ndivisions of labor are paralleled by the great processes of degeneration\r\ninto fat, fibrous tissue, and bone or chalk. A vital chemical change\r\nwhich would be perfectly healthy in one tissue or organ, in another may\r\nbe fatal.\r\n\r\nNinety-nine times out of a hundred any group of cells acts loyally in\r\nthe interests of the body; once in a hundred some group acts against\r\nthem, and for its own, and disease is the result. There is a perpetual\r\nstruggle for survival going on between the different tissues and organs\r\nof the body. Like all other free competition, as a rule, it inures\r\nenormously to the benefit of the body-whole. Exceptionally, however, it\r\nfails to do so, and behold disease. This struggle and turmoil is not\r\nonly necessary to life--it is life. Out of the varying chances of its\r\nwarfare is born that incessant ebb and flow of chemical change, that\r\ninability to reach an equilibrium, which we term \"vitality.\" The course\r\nof life, like that of a flying express train, is not a perfectly\r\nstraight line, but an oscillating series of concentric curves. Without\r\nthese oscillations movement could not be. Exaggerate one of them unduly,\r\nor fail to rectify it by a rebound oscillation, and you have disease.\r\n\r\nOr it is like the children's game of shuttlecock. So long as the flying\r\nshuttle keeps moving in its restless course to and fro, life is. A\r\nsingle stop is death. The very same blow which, rightly placed, sends it\r\nlike an arrow to the safe centre of the opposing racket, if it fall\r\nobliquely, or even with too great or too little force, drives it\r\nperilously wide of its mark. It can recover the safe track only by a\r\nsudden and often violent lunge of the opposing racket. The straight\r\ncourse is life, the tangent disease, the saving lunge recovery.\r\n\r\nOne and the same force produces all.\r\n\r\nIn the millions of tiny blows dealt every minute in our body-battle,\r\nwhat wonder if some go wide of the mark!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nOUR LEGACY OF HEALTH: THE POWER OF HEREDITY IN THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evil in things always bulks large in our imaginations. It is no mere\r\ncoincidence that the earliest gods of a race are invariably demons. Our\r\nfirst conception of the great forces of nature is that they are our\r\nenemies. This misconception is not only natural, but even necessary on\r\nthe sternest of physical bases. The old darky, Jim, in Huckleberry Finn,\r\nhit upon a profound and far-reaching truth when he replied in answer to\r\nHuck's question whether among all the signs and portents with which his\r\nmind was crammed--like black cats and seeing the moon over your left\r\nshoulder and \"harnts\"--some were not indications of good luck instead of\r\nall being of evil omen:--\r\n\r\n\"Mighty few--an' _dey_ ain't no use to a body. What fur you want to know\r\nwhen good luck's a-comin'? Want to keep it off?\"\r\n\r\nIt isn't the good, either in the forces of nature or in our fellows,\r\nthat keeps us watchful, but the evil. Hence our proneness to declare in\r\nall ages that evil is stronger than good and that \"all men are liars.\"\r\nOne injury done us by storm, by sunstroke, by lightning-flash, will make\r\na more lasting impression upon our memories than a thousand benefits\r\nconferred by these same forces. Besides, evil has to be sharply looked\r\nout for and guarded against. Well enough can be safely let alone.\r\n\r\nThe conviction is steadily growing, among both physicians and\r\nbiologists, that this attitude has caused a serious, if not vital,\r\nmisconception of the influence of that great conservative and\r\npreservative force of nature--heredity. We hear a great deal of\r\nhereditary disease, hereditary defect, hereditary insanity, but very\r\nlittle of hereditary powers of recovery, of inherited vigor, and the\r\nfact that ninety-nine and seven-tenths per cent of us are sane.\r\n\r\nOne instance of hereditary defect, of inherited degeneracy, fills us\r\nwith horror and stirs us to move Heaven and earth to prevent another\r\nsuch. The inheritance of vigor, of healthfulness, and of sanity we\r\nplacidly accept as a matter of course and bank upon it in our plans for\r\nthe future, without so much as a thank you to the force that underlies\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen once we clear away these inherited misconceptions and look the\r\nfacts of the situation squarely in the face, we find that heredity is at\r\nleast ten times as potent and as frequently concerned in the\r\ntransmission and securing of health and vigor as of disease and\r\nweakness; that its influence on the perpetuation of bodily and mental\r\ndefects has been enormously exaggerated and that there are exceedingly\r\nfew hereditary diseases.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary for our present purpose to enter into a discussion\r\nof the innumerable theories of that inevitable tendency of like to beget\r\nlike, of child to resemble parent, which we call heredity. One\r\nreference, however, may be permitted to the controversy that has\r\ndivided the scientific world: whether _acquired_ characters, changes\r\noccurring during the lifetime of the individual, can be inherited.\r\nDisease is nine times out of ten an acquired character; hence, instead\r\nof the probabilities being that it would be inherited, the balance of\r\nevidence to date points in exactly the opposite direction. The burden of\r\nproof as to the inheritance of disease is absolutely upon those who\r\nbelieve in its possibility.\r\n\r\nAnother fundamental fact which renders the inheritance of disease upon a\r\n_priori_ grounds improbable and upon practical grounds obviously\r\ndifficult, is that characters or peculiarities, in order to be inherited\r\ncertainly for more than a few generations, must be beneficial and\r\nhelpful in the struggle. A moment's reflection will show this to be\r\nmathematically necessary, in that any family or race which tended to\r\ninherit defects and injurious characters would rapidly go down in the\r\nstruggle for survival and become extinct. An inherited disease of any\r\nseriousness could not run for more than two or three generations in any\r\nfamily, simply for the reason that by the end of that time there would\r\nbe no family left for it to run in. A slight defect or small peculiarity\r\nof undesirable character might run for a somewhat longer period, but\r\neven this would tend toward disappearance and elimination by the stern,\r\nselective influence of environment.\r\n\r\nNaturally, this great conservative tendency of nature has, like all\r\nother influences, \"the defects of its virtues,\" as the French say. It\r\nhas no gifts of prophecy, and in the process of handing down to\r\nsuccessive generations those mechanisms and powers which have been\r\nfound useful in the long, stern struggle of the past, it will also hand\r\ndown some which, by reason of changes in the environment, are not only\r\nno longer useful, but even injurious. As the new light of biology has\r\nbeen turned on the human body and its diseases, it has revealed so many\r\nof these \"left-overs,\" or remnants in the body-machine--some of most\r\ndramatic interest--that they at first sight have done much to justify\r\nthe popular belief in the malignant tendencies of heredity.\r\n\r\nYet, broadly considered, the overwhelming majority of them should really\r\nbe regarded as honorable scars, memorials of ancient victories,\r\nmonuments to difficulties overcome, significant and encouraging\r\nindications of what our body-machine is still capable of accomplishing\r\nin the way of further adjustment to conditions in the future. The really\r\nsurprising thing is not their number, but the infrequency with which\r\nthey give rise to serious trouble.\r\n\r\nThe human automobile is not only astonishingly well built, with all the\r\nimprovements that hundreds of thousands of generations of experience\r\nhave been able to suggest, but it is self-repairing, self-cleaning, and\r\nself-improving. It never lets itself get out of date. If only given an\r\nadequate supply of fuel and water and not driven too hard, it will stand\r\nan astonishing amount of knocking about in all kinds of weather,\r\nrepairing itself and recharging its batteries every night, supplying its\r\nown oil, its own paint and polish, and even regulating its own changes\r\nof gear, according to the nature of the work it has to do. Simply as an\r\nendurance racer it is the toughest and longest-winded thing on earth\r\nand can run down and tire out every paw, pad, or hoof that strikes the\r\nground--wolf, deer, horse, antelope, wild goat. This is only a sample of\r\nits toughness and resisting power all along the line.\r\n\r\nThese wide powers of self-support and adjustment overbalance a hundred\r\ntimes any little remnant defects in its machinery or gearing. Easily\r\nninety-nine per cent of all our troubles through life are due to\r\ninevitable wear and tear, scarcity of food-fuel, of water, of rest, and\r\nexternal accidents--injuries and infectious diseases. Still, it\r\noccasionally happens that these little defects may furnish the point of\r\nleast resistance at which external stresses and strains will cause the\r\nmachine to break down. They are often the things which prevent us from\r\nliving and \"going to pieces all at once, all at once and nothing fust,\r\njust as bubbles do when they bust,\" like the immortal One-Hoss Shay. It\r\nis just as well that they should, for, of all deaths to die, the\r\nloneliest and the most to be dreaded is that by extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThese _vestigia_ or remnants--instances of apparently hidebound\r\nconservatism on nature's part--are very much in the public eye at\r\npresent, partly on account of their novelty and of their exceptional and\r\nextraordinary character. Easily first among these trouble-breeding\r\nremnants is that famous, or rather notorious, scrap of intestine, the\r\n_appendix vermiformis_, an obvious survival from that peaceful,\r\nancestral period when we were more largely herbivorous in our diet and\r\nrequired a longer and more complicated food-tube, with larger side\r\npouches in the course of it, to dissolve and absorb our food. Its\r\npresent utility is just about that of a grain of sand in the eye. Yet,\r\nconsidering that it is present in every human being born into the world,\r\nthe really astonishing thing is not the frequency with which it causes\r\ntrouble, but the surprisingly small amount of actual damage that arises\r\nfrom it. Never yet in even the most appendicitis-ridden community has it\r\nbeen found responsible for more than one half of one per cent of the\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\nThen there is that curious and by no means uncommon tendency for a loop\r\nof the intestine to escape from the abdominal cavity, which we call\r\nhernia. This is one of a fair-sized group of dangers clearly due to the\r\nassumption of the erect position and our incomplete adjustment thereto.\r\nIn the quadrupedal position this necessary weak spot--a partial opening\r\nthrough the abdominal wall--was developed in that region which was\r\nhighest from the point of view of gravity and least exposed to strain.\r\nIn the bipedal position it becomes lowest and most exposed; hence the\r\nmuch greater frequency of hernia in the human species as compared with\r\nany of the animals.\r\n\r\nAnother fragment, of the impertinence of whose presence many of us have\r\nhad painful proof, is the third or last molar, so absurdly misnamed the\r\nwisdom tooth. If there be any wisdom involved in its appearance it is of\r\nthe sort characterized by William Allen White's delicious definition:\r\n\"That type of ponderous folly of the middle-aged which we term 'mature\r\njudgment.'\" The last is sometimes worst as well as best, and this\r\nbelated remnant is not only the last to appear, but the first to\r\ndisappear. In a considerable percentage of cases it is situated so far\r\nback in the jaw that there is no room for it to erupt properly, and it\r\nproduces inflammatory disturbances and painful pressure upon the nerves\r\nof the face and the jaw.\r\n\r\nEven when it does appear it is often imperfectly developed, has fewer\r\ncusps and fewer roots than the other molars, is imperfectly covered with\r\nenamel and badly calcified. In no small percentage of cases it does not\r\nmeet its fellow of the jaw below and hence is almost useless for\r\npurposes of mastication. But it comes in every child born into the\r\nworld, simply because at an earlier day, when our jaws were longer--to\r\ngive our canine teeth the swing they needed as our chief weapons of\r\ndefense--there was plenty of room for it in the jaw and it was of some\r\nservice to the organism. If the Indiana State Legislature would only\r\npass a law prohibiting the eruption of wisdom teeth in future, and\r\nenforce it, it would save a large amount of suffering, inconvenience,\r\nand discomfort, with little appreciable lack of efficiency!\r\n\r\nIn this list of admitted charges against heredity must also come the\r\ngall-bladder, that curious little pouch budded out from the bile ducts,\r\nwhich has so little known utility as compared with its possibility as a\r\nstarting-point for inflammations, gall-stones, and cancer.\r\n\r\nThen there is that disfiguring facial defect, hare-lip, due to a failure\r\nof the three parts of which our upper jaw is built to unite\r\nproperly,--this triple construction of the jaw being an echo of\r\nancestral fishlike and reptilian times when our jaws were built in five\r\npieces to permit of wide distention in the act of swallowing our prey\r\nalive. All over the surface of the body are to be found innumerable\r\nlittle sebaceous glands originally intended to lubricate hairs, which\r\nhave now atrophied and disappeared. These useless scraps, under various\r\nforms of irritation, both external and internal, become inflamed and\r\ngive rise to pimples, acne, or \"a bad complexion.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the list might be drawn out to most impressive length. But this\r\nlength would be no indication of its real importance, inasmuch as the\r\nvast majority of entries upon it would come under the head of\r\npathological curiosities, or conditions which were chiefly interesting\r\non account of their rareness and unusual character. With the exception\r\nof the appendix, the gall-bladder, and hernia, these vestigial\r\nconditions may be practically disregarded as factors in the death-rate.\r\n\r\nIn the main, when the fullest possible study and recognition have been\r\nmade of all the traces of experimentation and even of ancient failure\r\nthat are to be found in this Twentieth Century body-machine of ours, the\r\nresulting impression is one of enormously increased respect for and\r\nconfidence in the machine and its capabilities. While they are of great\r\ninterest as indicating what the past history and experiences of the\r\nengine have been, and of highest value as enabling us to interpret and\r\neven anticipate certain weak spots in its construction and joints in its\r\narmor, their most striking influence is in the direction of emphasizing\r\nthe enormous elasticity and resourcefulness of the creature.\r\n\r\nNot only has it met and survived all these difficulties, but it is\r\ncontinuing the selfsame processes to-day. So far as we are able to\r\njudge, it is as young and as adaptable as it ever was, and just as ready\r\nto \"with a frolic welcome greet the thunder and the sunshine\" as it ever\r\nwas in the dawn of history.\r\n\r\nThese ancestral and experimental flaws, even when unrecognized and\r\nunguarded against, have probably not at any time been responsible for\r\nmore than one or two per cent of the body's breakdowns; while, on the\r\nother hand, every process with which it fights disease, every trick of\r\nstrategy which it uses against invading organisms, every step in the\r\nprocess of repair after wounds or injury, is a trick which it has\r\nlearned in its million-year battle with its surroundings.\r\n\r\nTake such a simple thing as the mere apparently blind habit possessed by\r\nthe blood of coagulating as soon as it comes in contact with the edges\r\nof a cut or torn blood-vessel, and think what an enormous safeguard this\r\nhas been and is against the possibility of death by hemorrhage. So well\r\nis it developed and so rapidly does it act that it is practically\r\nimpossible to bleed some animals to death by cutting across any vessel\r\nsmaller than one of the great aortic trunks. The rapidity and toughness\r\nof the clotting, combined with the other ancestral tricks of lowering\r\nthe blood pressure and weakening down the heart, are so immensely\r\neffective that a slash across the great artery of the thigh in the\r\ngroin of a dog will be closed completely before he can bleed to death.\r\nSo delicate and so purposeful is this adjustment that the blood will\r\ncontinue as fluid as milk for ten, twenty, forty, eighty years--as long\r\nas it remains in contact with healthy blood-vessels. But the instant it\r\nis brought in contact with a broken or wounded piece of a vessel-wall,\r\nthat instant it will begin to clot. So inevitable is this result that it\r\ngives rise to some of the sudden forms of death by bloodclot in the\r\nbrain or lung (apoplexy, \"stroke\"), the clot having formed upon the\r\nroughened inner surface of the heart or of one of the blood-vessels and\r\nthen floated into the brain or lung.\r\n\r\nThen take that matchless and ingenious process of the healing of wounds,\r\nwhose wondrousness increases with every step that we take into the\r\ndeeper details of its study. First, the quick outpouring and clotting of\r\nthe blood after enough has escaped to wash most poisonous or offending\r\nsubstances out of the wound. This living, surgical cement, elastic,\r\nself-moulding, soothing, not only plugs the cut or torn mouths of the\r\nblood-vessels, but fills the gap of the wound level with the surface.\r\nHere, by contact with the air and in combination with the hairs of the\r\nanimal it forms a tough, firm, protective coating or scab, completely\r\nshutting out cold, heat, irritants, or infectious germs.\r\n\r\nInto the wedge-shaped, elastic clot which now fills the wound from\r\nbottom to top like jelly in a mould, the leucocytes or white blood-cells\r\npromptly migrate and convert it into a mesh of living cells. They are\r\nmerely the cavalry and skirmishers of the repair brigade and are\r\nquickly followed by the heavy infantry of the line in the shape of cells\r\nborn of the injured tissues on either side of the wound. These join\r\nhands across the gap, the engineer corps and the commissariat department\r\nmove up promptly to their support in the form of little\r\nvein-construction switches, which bud out from the wounded\r\nblood-vessels. The clot is transformed into what we term granulation\r\ntissue and begins to organize. A few days later this granulation tissue\r\nbegins to contract and pull the lips of the wound together. If the gap\r\nhas not been too wide the wound will be completely closed, its lips and\r\ndeeper parts drawn together in nearly perfect line, separated only by a\r\nthin scar on the surface with a vertical keel of scar tissue descending\r\nfrom it. If the lips cannot be drawn together and there be no surgical\r\nskill at hand to assist them with stitches or bandages, then the gap\r\nwill be filled up by the fibrous transformation of this granulation\r\ntissue and a thick, heavy scar result. Meanwhile, the skin-cells of the\r\nsurface have not been idle, but are budding out on either side of the\r\nhealing wound, pushing a little line of colonists forward across the raw\r\nsurface. In longer or shorter time, according to the width of the gap,\r\nthese two lines meet, and the site of our wound or the scar that it has\r\nleft is perfectly coated over with a layer of healthy skin. This drama\r\nhas occurred so many score of times in every one of us that custom has\r\nblinded our eyes to its ingenious perfection, but it took a million\r\nyears to bring it to its present finish.\r\n\r\nIt may be a healthy corrective to our overweening conceit to remind\r\nourselves that, remarkable and valuable as it is, it is a mere infant\r\nin arms compared to the superb powers of replacement and repair\r\npossessed by our more remote ancestors. Most invertebrates and many of\r\nthe lowest two classes of backboned animals, the fishes and the\r\namphibians, cannot merely stop up a rent, but renew an entire limb,\r\nfin,--yes, even eye or head. Cut an earthworm in two and the rear half\r\nwill grow a new head and the front half a new tail. It may even be cut\r\nin four or five segments, each of which will proceed to form a head at\r\none end and a tail at the other. The lobster can regrow a complete gill\r\nand any number of claws or an eye. A salamander will reproduce a foot\r\nand part of a limb. Take out the crystalline lens in the eye of a\r\nsalamander and the edge of the iris, or colored part of the eye, will\r\ngrow another lens. Take out both the lens and the iris and the choroid\r\ncoat of the eye will reproduce both.\r\n\r\nWe are in the A, B, C class in powers of repair by comparison with the\r\nangleworm, the lobster, or the salamander. Yet we are not without\r\ngruesome echoes of this lost power of regeneration in that our whole\r\nbrood of tumors, including the deadly cancer and sarcoma, are due to a\r\nstrange resumption, on the part of some little knot of our body-cells,\r\nof the power of reproducing themselves or the organ in which they are\r\nsituated, without any regard to the welfare of the rest of the body.\r\nCancer is, in one sense, a throwing off of the allegiance to the\r\nbody-state and a resumption of amphibian powers of independent growth on\r\nthe part of certain groups of our body-cells--literally, a \"rebellion of\r\nthe cells.\"\r\n\r\nThese are but a handful of scores of instances that could be adduced,\r\nshowing that the majority of the processes upon which we rely in\r\ncombating disease and preserving life are the result of the hereditary\r\nexperiences of our cells. Intelligent physicians are receding completely\r\nfrom that curiously warped and jaundiced view which led us to regard\r\nheredity chiefly as a factor in the _production_ of disease. It was,\r\nperhaps, natural enough, since it was inevitably only its injurious, or,\r\nso to speak, malicious, effects which were brought to our attention to\r\nbe corrected. But, just as in the growth of our ethnic religions it is\r\nEvil that is worshiped first as strongest and most aggressive, and the\r\nrecognition of the greater power of good comes only at a later stage, so\r\nit has been in pathology.\r\n\r\nNot only do we regard heredity as a comparatively small and steadily\r\nreceding factor in the production of disease, but we fully and frankly\r\nrecognize it as the strongest and most important single force in its\r\nprevention. All our processes of repair, all the reactions of the body\r\nagainst the attack of accident or of disease, are hereditary endowments,\r\nworked out with infinite pains and labor through tens of thousands of\r\ngenerations. The utmost that we can do with our drugs and remedies is to\r\nappeal to and rouse into action the great healing power of nature, the\r\nclassic \"_Vis medicatrix Naturæ_,\" an incarnation of our past\r\nexperiences handed down by heredity. Enormously valuable and important\r\nas are the services to human welfare, health, and happiness which can be\r\nrendered by the destruction of the living external causes of disease and\r\nthe prevention of contagion, our most permanent and substantial\r\nvictories are won by appealing to and increasing this long-descended and\r\nhard-won power of individual resistance.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" says some one at once, \"I thought there were a large number of\r\nhereditary diseases.\" Fifty years ago there were a score of such, twenty\r\nyears ago the score had sunk to five or six. Now there is scarcely one\r\nleft. There is no known disease which is directly inherited as such.\r\nThere is scarcely even a disease in which we now regard heredity as\r\nplaying a dominant or controlling part. Among the few diseases in which\r\nthere is serious dispute as to this are tuberculosis, insanity,\r\nepilepsy, and cancer.\r\n\r\nThen there are diseases which for a long time puzzled us as to the\r\npossibility of their inheritance, but which have now resolved themselves\r\nclearly into instances of the fact that a mother who happens to contract\r\nan acute infectious disease of any sort may communicate that disease to\r\nthe unborn child. If this occurs at an early stage of development the\r\nchild will naturally be promptly killed. In fact, this is the almost\r\ninvariable result in smallpox and yellow fever. If, on the other hand,\r\ndevelopment be further advanced or the infection be of a milder\r\ncharacter, like scarlet fever or syphilis, the child may be born\r\nsuffering with the disease or with the virus in its blood, which will\r\ncause the disease to develop within a few days after birth. This,\r\nhowever, is clearly not inheritance at all, but direct infection. We no\r\nlonger use the term _hereditary_ syphilis but have substituted for it\r\nthe word _congenital_, which simply means that a child is born with the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThere is no such thing as this disease extending \"unto the third and\r\nfourth generation,\" like the wrath of Jehovah. One fact must, of course,\r\nbe remembered, which has probably proved a source of confusion in the\r\npopular mind, and that is its extraordinary \"long-windedness.\" It takes\r\nnot merely two or three weeks or months to develop its complete drama,\r\nbut anywhere from three to thirty years, so that it is possible for a\r\nchild to be born with the taint in its blood and yet not exhibit to the\r\nnon-expert eye any sign of the disease until its eighth, twelfth, or\r\neven fifteenth year.\r\n\r\nThe case of tuberculosis is almost equally clear-cut. In all the\r\nthousands of post-mortem examinations which have been held upon newborn\r\nchildren and upon mothers dying in or shortly after childbirth, the\r\nnumber of instances of the actual transference of the bacilli of\r\ntuberculosis from mother to child could be counted upon the fingers of\r\ntwo hands. It is one of the rarest of pathologic curiosities and, for\r\npractical purposes, may be entirely disregarded. When tuberculosis\r\nappears in several members of a family, in eight cases out of ten it is\r\ndue to direct infection from parents or older children. This is\r\nstrikingly brought out in the admirable work done by the Associated\r\nDispensaries for Tuberculosis of the Charity Organization Society of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nOne of the first steps in advance which they took was to establish in\r\nconnection with every clinic for tuberculosis an attendant nurse, whose\r\nduty it was to visit the patients at their homes and advise and instruct\r\nthem as to improvements in their methods of living, ventilation, food,\r\nand the prevention of infection.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before these intelligent women began to bring back\r\nreports of other cases in the same family. Now the procedure is\r\nregularly adopted, whenever a case presents itself, of rounding up the\r\nremainder of the family group for examination, with the astounding\r\nresult that where a mother or father is tuberculous, from twenty to\r\nsixty per cent of the children will be found to be suffering from some\r\nform of the infection. Instances of three infected children out of five\r\nliving in the same room with a tuberculous mother are actually on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nNo one can practice long in any of our great climatic health resorts for\r\ntuberculosis, like Colorado or the Pacific Slope, without coming across\r\nscores of painful and distressing instances of children of tuberculous\r\nparents dying suddenly in convulsions from tuberculous meningitis, or by\r\na wasting diarrh[oe]a from tuberculosis of the bowels, or from a violent\r\nattack of distention of the bowels due to tuberculous peritonitis. The\r\nfavorite breeding-place of the tubercle bacillus is unfortunately in the\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while the vast majority of cases of so-called\r\nhereditary tuberculosis are due to direct infection, and may be\r\nprevented by proper disposal of the sputum and other methods for\r\navoiding contagion, there is probably a hereditary element in the spread\r\nof tuberculosis to this degree: that, inasmuch as all of us have been\r\nexposed to the attack and invasion of the tubercle bacillus, not merely\r\nscores, but hundreds of times, and have been able to resist or throw\r\noff that attack without apparent injury, the development of an invasion\r\nof the tubercle bacillus sufficiently extensive to endanger life is, in\r\nnine cases out of ten, in itself a proof of lowered resisting power on\r\nthe part of the patient. This may be, and often is, only temporary, due\r\nto overwork, underfeeding, overconfinement, or that form of gradual\r\nsuffocation which we politely term inadequate ventilation.\r\n\r\nIn a certain percentage of cases, however, it is due to a chronic lack\r\nof vigor and vitality; a lowering of the whole systemic tone, which may\r\nhave existed from birth. In that case it is hardly to be expected that\r\nsuch an individual, becoming a parent, will be able to transmit to his\r\nor her offspring more vigor than he originally possessed. It is\r\ntherefore probable that the children of a considerable percentage of\r\ntuberculous parents would not possess the same degree of resisting power\r\nagainst tuberculosis, or any other infection, as the average individual.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this factor of inherited lowered resistance plays\r\nany very important part in the propagation of tuberculosis, partly\r\nbecause it is comparatively seldom that consumptive marries consumptive,\r\nand such tendencies to lowered vigor and vitality as may be transmitted\r\nby one parent will be neutralized by the other; partly also because, by\r\nthe superb and beneficent logic of nature, the pedigree of any disease\r\nis of the most mushroom and insignificant length, while the pedigree of\r\nhealth stretches back to the very dawn of time. In the struggle for\r\ndominance which takes place between the germ cells of the father and\r\nthose of the mother, the chances are at least ten to one in favor of\r\nthe old ancestral traits of vigor, of resisting power, and of survival.\r\nHow deeply this idea is implanted in the convictions of the scientific\r\nworld, the bitterly and widely debated biologic question whether\r\nacquired characters or peculiarities can under any circumstances be\r\ninherited clearly shows. Victory for the present rests with those who\r\ndeny the possibility of such inheritance, and disease is emphatically an\r\nacquired character.\r\n\r\nTruth here, as everywhere, probably lies between the extremes, and both\r\nbiologists and the students of disease have arrived at practically the\r\nsame working compromise, namely, that while no gross defect, such as a\r\nmutilation, nor definite disease factor, such as a germ, nor even a\r\ncancer, can possibly be inherited, yet, inasmuch as the two cells, which\r\nby their development form the new individual, are nourished by the blood\r\nof the maternal body, influences which affect the nutritiousness or\r\nhealthfulness of that blood may unfavorably influence the development of\r\nthe offspring.\r\n\r\nDisease cannot be inherited any more than a mutilating defect, but the\r\nresults of both, in so far as they affect the nutrition of the offspring\r\nin the process of formation, may be transmitted, though to a very much\r\nsmaller extent than we formerly believed. In the case of tuberculosis,\r\nif the mother, during the months that she is building up the body and\r\nframework of a child, is in a state of reduced or lowered nutrition on\r\naccount of consumption or any other disease, or has her tissues\r\nsaturated with the toxins of this disease, it is hardly to be expected\r\nthat the development of the child will proceed with the same perfection\r\nas it would under perfectly normal maternal surroundings.\r\n\r\nHowever, even this influence is comparatively small; for one of the most\r\nmarvelous things in nature is the perfection of the barrier which she\r\nhas erected between the child before birth and any injurious conditions\r\nwhich may occur in the body of the mother. Here preference, so to speak,\r\nis given to the coming life, and whenever there is a contest for an\r\nadequate supply of nutrition, as, for instance, in cases of underfeeding\r\nor of famine, it is the mother who will suffer in her nutrition rather\r\nthan the child. The unborn child, biologically considered, feeds upon\r\nthe best she has to offer, rejecting all that is inferior, doing nothing\r\nand giving nothing in return.\r\n\r\nHow perfectly the coming generation is protected under the most\r\nunfavorable circumstances we have been given a striking object-lesson in\r\none family of the lower animals. In the effective crusade against\r\ntuberculosis in dairy cattle waged by the sanitary authorities in\r\nDenmark, it was early discovered that the greatest practical obstacle to\r\nthe extermination of tuberculosis in cattle was the enormous financial\r\nsacrifice involved in killing all animals infected. The disease was at\r\nthat time particularly rife among the high-bred Jersey, Holstein, and\r\nother milking breeds. It was determined as a working compromise to test\r\nthe truth of the modern belief that tuberculosis was transmitted only by\r\ndirect infection, by permitting the more valuable cows to be saved alive\r\nfor breeding purposes. They were isolated from the rest of the herd and\r\ngiven the best of care and feeding. The moment that their calves were\r\nborn they were removed from them altogether and brought up on the milk\r\nof perfectly healthy cows. The milk of the infected cows was either\r\ndestroyed or sterilized and used for feeding pigs.\r\n\r\nThe results were brilliantly successful. Scarcely one of the calves thus\r\nisolated developed tuberculosis in spite of their highly infected\r\nancestry. And not only were they not inferior in vigor and perfection of\r\ntype to the remainder of their breed, but some of them have since become\r\nprize-winners. The additional care and more abundant feeding that they\r\nreceived more than compensated for any problematic defect in their\r\nheredity.\r\n\r\nAs to the heredity of cancer, all that can be said is that the burden of\r\nproof rests upon those who assert it. It is really curious how\r\nwidespread the belief is that cancer \"runs in families,\" and how\r\nexceedingly slender is the basis of evidence for such a belief. There\r\nare so many things that we do not know about cancer that any positive\r\nstatement of any kind would be unbecoming. It would be absurd to declare\r\nthat a disease, of which the cause is still unknown, either is or is not\r\ninherited. And this is our position in regard to cancer. An overwhelming\r\nmajority of the evidence so far indicates that it is not a parasite; if\r\nit were, of course, we could say positively that it is not inherited.\r\nAlthough we are getting a discouraging degree of familiarity with the\r\nprocess and clearly recognize that it consists chiefly in the sudden\r\nrevolt or rebellion of some group of cells, a tendency which quite\r\nconceivably might be transmitted to future generations, yet it is highly\r\nimprobable, on both biological and pathological grounds, that such is\r\nthe case. If this rebellious tendency were transmitted we should at\r\nleast have the right to expect that it would appear in the cells of the\r\nsame organ or region of the body. It is a singular fact that in all the\r\nhundreds of cases in which cancer has appeared in the child of a\r\ncancerous parent it has almost invariably appeared in some different\r\norgan from that affected in the parent.\r\n\r\nFor instance, cancer of the lip in the father may be followed by cancer\r\nof the liver in the son or daughter, while cancer of the breast in the\r\nmother will be followed by cancer of the lip in a son. Further than\r\nthis, the percentage of instances in which cancer appears in more than\r\none member of a family is decidedly small, considering the frequency of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nI took occasion to look into the matter carefully from a statistical\r\npoint of view some ten or twelve years ago, and out of a collection of\r\nsome fifty thousand cases of cancer less than six per cent were found to\r\ngive any history of cancer in the family. And this, of course, simply\r\nmeans that some one of the relatives of the patient had at one time\r\ndeveloped the disease.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the consensus of intelligent expert opinion upon the subject of\r\nheredity of cancer is, that though it may occur, we have comparatively\r\nlittle proof of the fact; that the percentage of cases in which there is\r\ncancer in the family is but little larger than might be expected on the\r\ndoctrine of probabilities from the average distribution. Though possibly\r\nthe offspring of a cancerous individual may display a slightly greater\r\ntendency toward the development of that strange, curious process of\r\n\"autonomy\" than the offspring of the average individual, this tendency\r\nis so small and occurs so infrequently as to be a factor of small\r\npractical importance in the propagation and spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn insanity and epilepsy we have probably the last refuge and almost\r\nonly valid instance of the old belief in the remorseless heredity of\r\ndisease. But even here the part played by heredity is probably only a\r\nfraction of that which it is popularly, and even professionally,\r\nbelieved to play. It is, of course, obvious that diseases which tend\r\nquickly to destroy the life of the patient, especially those which kill\r\nor seriously cripple him before he has reached the age of reproduction,\r\nor prevent his long surviving that epoch, will not, for mechanical\r\nreasons, become hereditary. The Black Death, or the cholera, for\r\ninstance, could not \"run in a family.\" Supposing that children were born\r\nwith a special susceptibility to this disease, there would obviously\r\nsoon be no family left.\r\n\r\nThe same is true in a lesser degree of milder or more chronic diseases.\r\nThe family which was hereditarily predisposed to scarlet fever, measles,\r\nsmallpox, or tuberculosis would not last long, and in fact the whole\r\nprogress of civilization has been a continuous process of the weeding\r\nout of those who were most susceptible and the survival of those who\r\nwere least so.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to deal with certain conditions, fortunately rare, such\r\nas functional disturbances of the nervous system, which neither\r\nseriously unfit their possessor for the struggle of life nor prevent\r\nhim from reproducing his kind, then it becomes possible that a tendency\r\nto such disease may be transmitted through several successive\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with insanity, with epilepsy, with _hemophilia_, or\r\n\"bleeders,\" and with certain rare and curious disturbances of the\r\nnervous system, such as the hereditary _ataxias_ and \"tics\" of various\r\nsorts. However, even here the only conditions on which these diseases\r\ncan continue to run in a family for more than one or two generations is\r\neither that they shall be mild in form or that only a comparatively\r\nsmall percentage of the total family shall be affected by them. If, for\r\ninstance, two-thirds, one-half, or even a third of the descendants of a\r\nmentally unsound individual were to become insane, it would only need a\r\nfew generations for that family to be crushed to the wall.\r\n\r\nWhile the descendants of insane persons are distinctly more liable to\r\nbecome insane than the rest of the community, yet, on account of their\r\nfewness, this tendency probably does not account for more than a small\r\nfraction of the total insanity. We should, by all means, prevent the\r\nmarriage of the insane and discourage that of their children, and the\r\ndevelopment of any well-defined form of insanity should act at once,\r\n_ipso facto_, as a ground and cause of divorce.\r\n\r\nBut the consoling fact remains that even of such children, providing, of\r\ncourse, as usually happens, that the other parent--husband or wife--is\r\nsound and sane, not more than ten or fifteen per cent would probably\r\nbecome insane. In other words, insanity is acquired and the result of\r\nindividual stress and strain at least five times as frequently as it is\r\ninherited. We have absolutely no rational or statistical basis for\r\ngloomy predictions that, at present rates, within a couple of centuries\r\nmore, we shall all be shut up in asylums with nobody left to support us\r\nand pay the taxes. The apparent increase of insanity of recent decades\r\nis probably only \"on paper,\" due to better registration.\r\n\r\nTo put it very roughly, probably ninety-eight per cent of us are so\r\nborn, thanks to heredity, that the possibility of our becoming insane,\r\neven under the severest stress, is almost infinitesimal. Of the two per\r\ncent born with this taint, this possible tendency to mental unbalance,\r\nonly about one-tenth now become completely insane,[1] and this\r\npercentage might be greatly diminished by general sanitary improvements.\r\nOur alienists now claim that, by checking the reproduction of the\r\nobviously unstable, and careful hygienic treatment and training of the\r\npredisposed two per cent, insanity is almost as preventable as\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The proportion of registered insane in civilized countries\r\nto-day ranges from two to three per 1000 of the population.]\r\n\r\nIn fine, from all the broad field of pathology, the mists of tradition\r\nwhich have dimmed the fair name and reputation of heredity are slowly\r\nbut surely lifting, until we now behold it, not as our worst enemy, but\r\nas our best friend in the prevention of disease and the upbuilding of\r\nthe race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSIOGNOMY OF DISEASE: WHAT A DOCTOR CAN TELL FROM APPEARANCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our pride that medicine, from an art, and a pretty black one at\r\nthat, originally, is becoming a science. And the most powerful factor in\r\nthis development, its indispensable basis, in fact, has been the\r\ninvention of instruments of precision--the microscope, the fever\r\nthermometer, the stethoscope, the ophthalmoscope, the test-tube, the\r\nculture medium, the triumphs of the bacteriologist and of the chemist.\r\nAny man who makes a final diagnosis in a serious case without resorting\r\nto some or all of these means is regarded--and justly--as careless and\r\nderelict in his duty to his patient.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, priceless and indispensable as are these laboratory\r\nmethods of investigation, they should not be allowed to make us too\r\nscornful and neglectful of the evidence gained by the direct use of our\r\nfive senses. We should still avail ourselves of every particle of\r\ninformation that can be gained by the trained eye, the educated ear, the\r\nexpert touch,--the _tactus eruditus_ of the medical classics,--and even\r\nthe sense of smell. There is, in fact, a general complaint among the\r\nolder members of the profession that the rising generation is being\r\ntrained to neglect and even despise the direct evidence of the senses,\r\nand to accept no fact as a fact unless it has been seen through the\r\nmicroscope or demonstrated by a reaction in the test-tube. As one of our\r\nkeenest observers and most philosophic thinkers expressed it a few\r\nmonths ago:--\r\n\r\n\"I fear that certain physicians on their rounds are most careful to take\r\nwith them their stethoscope, their thermometer, their hemoglobin papers,\r\ntheir sphygmomanometer, but leave their eyes and their brains at home.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it is certain that the art of sight diagnosis, which seems like half\r\nmagic, possessed in such a wonderful degree by the older physicians of\r\nthe passing and past generations, has been almost lost by the new.\r\n\r\nA healthful reaction has, however, set in; and while we certainly do not\r\nlove the Cæsar of laboratory methods and accuracy the less, we are\r\nbeginning to have a juster affection for the Rome of the rich harvest\r\nthat may be gained from the careful, painstaking, detective-like\r\nexercise of our eye, ear, and hand.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the conflict between the two methods is only\r\napparent. Not only is each in its proper sphere indispensable, but they\r\nare enormously helpful one to the other. Instead of our being able to\r\ntell less by the careful, direct eye-and-hand examination of our\r\npatients than the doctor of a century ago, we can tell three to five\r\ntimes as much. Signs that he could interpret only by the slow and\r\npainful method of two-thirds of a lifetime of plodding experience, or by\r\noccasional flashes of half-inspired insight, we are now able to\r\ninterpret absolutely upon a physiological--yes, a chemical--basis from\r\nthe revelations of the microscope, the test-tube, and the culture\r\nmedium. His only way of determining the meaning of a particular tint of\r\nthe complexion, or line about the mouth, or eruption on the skin, was by\r\nslowly and laboriously accumulating a long series of similar cases in\r\nwhich that particular symptom was found always to occur, and deducing\r\nits meaning. Now, we simply take a drop of our patient's blood, a\r\nscraping from his throat, a portion of some one of his secretions, a\r\nlittle slice of a tumor or growth, submit them to direct examination in\r\nthe laboratory, and get a prompt and decisive answer.\r\n\r\nThe observant physician begins to gather information about a patient\r\nfrom the moment he enters the sick-room or the patient steps into his\r\nconsulting-room; and the value of the information obtained in the first\r\nthirty seconds, before a word has been spoken, is sometimes\r\nastonishingly great. While no intelligent man would dream of depending\r\nupon this first _coup d'[oe]il_, \"stroke of the eye\" as the French so\r\ngraphically call it, for his final diagnosis, or accept its findings\r\nuntil he had submitted them to the most ruthless cross-examination with\r\nthe stethoscope and in the laboratory, yet it will sometimes give him a\r\nclew of almost priceless value. It is positively uncanny to see the\r\nswift, intuitive manner in which an old, experienced, and thoughtful\r\nphysician will grasp the probable nature of a case in one keen look at a\r\npatient. Often he can hardly explain to you himself how he does it, what\r\nare the data that determine it; yet not infrequently, three times out\r\nof five, your most elaborate and painstaking study of the case with all\r\nthe modern methods will bring you to the same conclusion as that sensed\r\nwithin forty-five seconds by this keen-eyed old sleuth-hound of the\r\nfever trails. Time and again, in my interne days, have I gone the rounds\r\nof the wards or the out-patient departments with some kindly-faced,\r\nkeen-eyed old Sherlock Holmes of the profession, and seen him point to a\r\nnew case across the ward with the question: \"When did that pneumonia\r\ncome in?\" or pick out a pain-drawn, ashy mask in the waiting line, with\r\nan abrupt, \"Bring me that case of cancer of the stomach. He's in pain.\r\nI'll take him first.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in later years, I have had colleagues with whom it was positively\r\npainful to walk down a crowded street, from the gruesome habit that they\r\nhad of picking out, and condemning to lingering deaths, the cases of\r\ncancer, of Bright's disease, or of locomotor ataxia, that we happened to\r\nmeet. Of course, they would be the first to admit that this was only\r\nwhat they would term a \"long shot,\" a guess; but it was a guess based\r\nupon significant changes in the patient's countenance or gait, which\r\ntheir trained eye picked out at once, and it was surprising how often\r\nthis snapshot diagnosis turned out to be correct.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that a medical student has to learn is that appearances\r\nare _not_ deceptive--except to fools. Every line of the human figure,\r\nevery proportion of a limb, every detail of size, shape, or relation in\r\nan organ, _means_ something. Not a line upon any bone in the skeleton\r\nwhich was not made by the hand-grip or thumbprint of some muscle,\r\ntendon, or ligament; no bump or knuckle which is not a lever or\r\nhand-hold for the grip of some muscle; not a line or a curve or an\r\nopening in that Chinese puzzle, the skull, which was not made to protect\r\nthe brain, to accommodate an eye, to transmit a blood-vessel, or to\r\nallow the escape of a nerve. Every minutest detail of structure means\r\nsomething to the man who will take the pains to puzzle it out. And if\r\nthis is true of the foundation structure of the body, is it to be\r\nexpected that the law ceases to run upon the surface?\r\n\r\nNot a line, not a tint, not a hollow of that living picture, the face,\r\nbut means something, if we will take the time and labor to interpret it.\r\nEven coming events cast their shadows before upon that most exquisitely\r\nresponsive surface--half mirror, half sensitive plate--the human\r\ncountenance. The place where the moving finger of disease writes its\r\nclearest and most unmistakable message is the one to which we must\r\nnaturally turn, the face; not merely for the infantile tenth part of a\r\nreason which we often hear alleged, that it is the only part of the\r\nbody, except the hand, which is habitually exposed, and hence open to\r\nobservation, but because here are grouped the indicators and registers\r\nof almost every important organ and system in the body.\r\n\r\nWhat, of course, originally made the face the face, and, for the matter\r\nof that, the head the head, was the intake opening of the food-canal,\r\nthe mouth. Around this necessarily grouped themselves the outlook\r\ndepartments, the special senses, the nose, the eyes, and ears; while\r\nlater, by an exceedingly clumsy device of nature, part of the mouth was\r\nsplit off for the intake of a new ventilating system. So that when we\r\nglance at the face we are looking first at the automatically controlled\r\nintake openings of the two most important systems in the body, the\r\nalimentary and the respiratory, whose muscles contract and relax, ripple\r\nin comfort or knot in agony, in response to every important change that\r\ntakes place throughout the entire extent of both.\r\n\r\nSecond, at the apertures of the two most important members of the\r\noutlook corps, the senses of sight and of smell. These are not only\r\nsharply alert to every external indication of danger, but by a curious\r\nreversal, which we will consider more carefully later, reflect signals\r\nof distress or discomfort from within. Last, but not least, the\r\ntranslucent tissues, the semi-transparent skin, barely veiling the\r\npulsating mesh of myriad blood-vessels, is a superb color index,\r\npainting in vivid tints--\"yellow, and ashy pale, and hectic red\"--the\r\nliving, ever changing, moving picture of the vigor of the life-centre,\r\nthe blood-pump, and the richness of its crimson stream. Small wonder\r\nthat the shrewd advice of a veteran physician to the medical student\r\nshould be: \"The first step in the examination is to look at your\r\npatient; the second is to look again, and the third to take another look\r\nat him; and keep on looking all through the examination.\"\r\n\r\nIt is no uncommon thing for an expert diagnostician deliberately to lead\r\nthe patient into conversation upon some utterly irrelevant subjects,\r\nlike the weather, the crops, or the incidents of his journey to the\r\ncity, simply for the purpose of taking his mind off himself, putting\r\nhim at his ease, and meanwhile quietly deciphering the unmistakable\r\ncuneiform inscription, often twice palimpsest, written by the finger of\r\ndisease upon his face. It takes time and infinite pains. In no other\r\nrealm does genius come nearer to Buffon's famous description, \"the\r\ncapacity for taking pains,\" but it is well worth the while. And with all\r\nour boasted and really marvelous progress in precise knowledge of\r\ndisease, accomplished through the microscope in the laboratory, it\r\nremains a fact of experience that so careful and so trustworthy is this\r\nface-picture when analyzed, that our best and most depended upon\r\nimpressions as to the actual condition of patients, are still obtained\r\nfrom this source. Many and many a time have I heard the expression from\r\na grizzled consultant in a desperate case, \"Well, the last blood-count\r\nwas better,\" or, \"The fever is lower,\" or, \"There is less albumen,--but\r\nI don't like the look of him a bit\"; and within twenty-four hours you\r\nmight be called in haste to find your patient down with a hemorrhage, or\r\nin a fatal chill, or sinking into the last coma.\r\n\r\nIt would really be difficult to say just what that careful and loving\r\nstudent of the _genus humanum_ known as a doctor looks at first in the\r\nface of a patient. Indeed, he could probably hardly tell you himself,\r\nand after he has spent fifteen or twenty years at it, it has become such\r\na second nature, such a matter of instinct with him, that he will often\r\nput together all the signs at once, note their relations, and come to a\r\nconclusion almost in the \"stroke of an eye,\" as if by instinct, just as\r\na weather-wise old salt will tell you by a single glance at the sky\r\nwhen and from what quarter a storm is coming.\r\n\r\nI shall never forget the remark of my greatest and most revered teacher,\r\nwhen he called me into his consultation-room to show me a case of\r\ntypical locomotor ataxia, gave me a brief but significant history, put\r\nthe patient through his paces, and asked for a diagnosis. I hesitated,\r\nblundered through a number of further unnecessary questions, and finally\r\nstumbled upon it. After the patient had left the room, I, feeling rather\r\nproud of myself, expected his commendation, but I didn't get it. \"My\r\nboy,\" he said, \"you are not up to the mark yet. You should be able to\r\nrecognize a disease like that just as you know the face of an\r\nacquaintance on the street.\" A positive and full-blown diagnosis of this\r\nsort can, of course, only be made in two or three cases out of ten. But\r\nthe method is both logical and scientific, and will give information of\r\npriceless value in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred.\r\n\r\nProbably the first, if not the most important, character that catches\r\nthe physician's eye when it first falls upon a patient is his\r\nexpression. This, of course, is a complex of a number of different\r\nmarkings, but chiefly determined by certain lines and alterations of\r\nposition of the skin of the face, which give to it, as we frequently\r\nhear it expressed, an air of cheerfulness or depression, comfort or\r\ndiscomfort, hope or despair. These lines, whether temporary or\r\npermanent, are made by the contractions of certain muscles passing from\r\none part of the skin to another or from the underlying bones to the\r\nskin. These are known in our anatomical textbooks by the natural but\r\nabsurd name of \"muscles of expression.\"\r\n\r\nTheir play, it is true, does make up about two-thirds of the wonderful\r\nshifting of relations, which makes the human countenance the most\r\nexpressive thing in the world; but their original business is something\r\ntotally different. Primarily considered, they are solely for the purpose\r\nof opening or closing, contracting or expanding, the different orifices\r\nwhich, as we have seen, appear upon the surface of the face. This\r\nnaturally throws them into three great groups: those about and\r\ncontrolling the orifice of the alimentary canal, the mouth; those\r\nsurrounding the joint openings of the air-tube and organ of smell, and\r\nthose surrounding the eyes.\r\n\r\nAs there are some twenty-four pairs of these in an area only slightly\r\ngreater than that of the outspread hand, and as they are capable of\r\nacting with every imaginable grade of vigor and in every possible\r\ncombination, it can readily be seen what an infinite and complicated\r\nseries of expressions--or, in other words, indications of the state of\r\naffairs within those different orifices--they are capable of. Only the\r\nbarest and rudest outlines of their meaning and principles of\r\ninterpretation can be attempted. To put it very roughly, the main\r\nunderlying principle of interpretation is that we make our first\r\ninstinctive judgment of the site of the disease from noting which of the\r\nthree great orifices is distorted furthest from its normal condition.\r\nThen by constructing a parallel upon the similarity or the difference of\r\nthe lines about the other two openings, we get what a surveyor would\r\ncall our \"lines of triangulation,\" and by following these to their\r\nconverging point can often arrive at a fairly accurate localization.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in the method, though at times our greatest\r\nhelp, is the extraordinary and intimate sympathy which exists between\r\nall three of these groups. If pain, no matter where located, once\r\nbecomes intense enough, its manifestations will travel over the\r\nface-dial, overflowing the organ or system in which it occurs, and eyes,\r\nnostrils, and mouth will alike reveal its presence. Here, of course, is\r\nwhere our second great process, so well known in all clew-following,\r\nelimination, comes in.\r\n\r\nA patient comes in with pain-lines written all over his face. To put it\r\nvery roughly--has he cancer of the stomach? Pneumonia? Brain tumor? If\r\nthere be no play of the muscles distending and contracting the nostrils\r\nwith each expiration, no increased rapidity of breathing, no gasp when a\r\nfull breath is drawn, and no deep red fever blush on the cheeks, we\r\nmentally eliminate pneumonia. The absence of these nasal signs throws us\r\nback toward cancer or some other painful affection of the alimentary\r\ncanal. If the pain-lines about the mouth are of recent formation, and\r\nhave not graved themselves into the furrows of the forehead above and\r\nbetween the eyebrows; if the color, instead of ashy, be clear and red,\r\nwe throw out cancer and think of colic, ulcer, hyperacidity, or some\r\nmilder form of alimentary disease.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the pain-lines are heaviest about the brows, the\r\neyes, and the forehead, with only a sympathetic droop or twist of the\r\ncorners of the mouth, if the nostrils are not at all distorted or too\r\nmovable, if there is no fever flush and little wasting, and on turning\r\nto the eyes we find a difference between the pupils, or a wide\r\ndistention or pin-point-like contraction of both or a slight squint, the\r\npicture of brain tumor would rise in the mind. Once started upon any one\r\nof these clews, then a hundred other data would be quickly looked for\r\nand asked after, and ultimately, assisted by a thorough and exhaustive\r\nexamination with the instruments of precision and the tests in the\r\nlaboratory, a conclusion is arrived at. This, of course, is but the\r\nroughest and crudest outline suggestive of the method of procedure.\r\n\r\nProbably not more than once in three times will the first clew that we\r\nstart on prove to be the right one; but the moment that we find this\r\nbarred, we take up the next most probable, and in this manner hit upon\r\nthe true scent.\r\n\r\nAs to the cause and rationale of these pain-lines, only the barest\r\noutlines can be given. Take the mouth for an example. When all is going\r\nwell in the alimentary canal, without pain, without hunger, and both\r\nabsorption of food and elimination of waste are proceeding normally, the\r\ntissues about the mouth, like those of the rest of the body, are apt to\r\nbe plump and full; the muscles which open the aperture, having fulfilled\r\ntheir duty and received their regular wages, are quietly at rest; those\r\nthat close the opening, having neither anticipation of an early call for\r\nthe admission of necessary nutriment, nor an instinctive desire to shut\r\nout anything that may be indigestible or undesirable, are now in their\r\nnormal condition of peaceful, moderate contraction; the face has a\r\ncomfortable, well-fed, wholesome look. On the other hand, let the\r\ndigestive juices fail to do their duty properly, or the swarms of\r\nbacteria pets which we keep in our food-canals get beyond control; or if\r\nfor any other reason the tissues be kept from getting their proper\r\nsupply of nourishment from the food-canal, the state of affairs is\r\nquickly revealed in the mouth mirror. Those muscles which open the\r\nmouth, instead of resting peacefully in the consciousness of duty well\r\ndone, are in a state of perpetual fidget, twitching, pulling, wondering\r\nwhether they ought not to open the portal for the entrance of new\r\nsupplies of material, since the tissues are crying for food.\r\n\r\nAs the strongest of these are those which pull the corners of the mouth\r\noutward and downward, the resultant expression is one of depression,\r\nwith downward-curving angles to the mouth. The eyes, and even the\r\nnostrils, sympathetically follow suit, and we have that countenance\r\nwhich, by the cartoonist's well-known trick, can be produced by the\r\nalteration of one pair of lines, those at the angles of the mouth,\r\nturning a smiling countenance into a weeping one. On the other hand, if\r\nall these processes of nutrition and absorption are proceeding as they\r\nshould, they are accompanied by mild sensations of comfort which,\r\nalthough they no longer reach our consciousness, reveal themselves in\r\nthe mouth-opening muscles, and they gently contract upward and outward,\r\nin pleasurable anticipation of the next intake, and we get the grin or\r\nthe smile.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, these digestive disturbances be accompanied by\r\npain, then another shading appears on our magic mirror, and that is a\r\ncurious contraction of the mouth, with distortion of the lines\r\nsurrounding it, so violent in some cases as positively to whiten the\r\nlips or produce lines of paleness along the course of the muscles. This\r\nis the set or twisted mouth of agony, and is due to a curious\r\ntransference and reflex on this order: that inasmuch as the last food\r\nwhich entered the alimentary canal seems to have caused this disturbance\r\nand pain, no more will be allowed to enter it at present under any\r\nconditions. And as our alimentary instincts are the most fundamental of\r\nall, by a due process of transference, mental agony calls into action\r\nthis same set of muscles, to shut out any possible addition to the agony\r\nalready present.\r\n\r\nThe lines of determination, similarly, about the mouth, are those of the\r\nindividual who has the courage to say \"No\" to the tempting morsel when\r\nhe doesn't need it; and the lines of weakness and irresolution are those\r\nof the nature which cannot resist either gastronomic or other\r\ntemptation. Similarly, the well-known lines of disgust or of discontent\r\nabout the corners of the mouth are the unconscious contractions\r\naccompanying nausea, and preparations to expel the offending morsel\r\nwhether from stomach or mouth.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, our first glance shows us that the deepest\r\npain-lines are those about the nostrils and upper lip, especially if the\r\nwings of the nostrils can be seen to dilate with each breath, and\r\nbreathing be faster than normal, our clew points in the direction of\r\nsome disease of the great organs above the diaphragm--that is, the\r\nlungs or heart.\r\n\r\nSigns in this region might refer to either of these, for the reason\r\nthat, although a sufficient intake of air is one of the necessary\r\nconditions of proper oxygenation, a free and abundant circulation of the\r\nblood through the air-cells is equally essential. In fact, that common\r\nphenomenon known as \"shortness of breath\" is more frequently due to\r\ndisturbances of the heart and circulation than it is to the lungs,\r\nespecially in patients who are able to be up and about. If, in addition\r\nto the danger signal of the rise and fall of the nostrils with each\r\nbreath, we have a pale, translucent skin, with a light, hectic flush\r\nshowing just below the knife-like lower edge of the cheekbone, a widely\r\nopen, shining eye, and a clustering abundance of hair of a glossiness\r\nbordering on dampness, red lips slightly parted, showing the teeth\r\nbetween, a painfully strong suspicion of consumption would arise\r\nunbidden.\r\n\r\nThis pathetic type of face has that fatal gift which the French\r\nclinicians, with their usual happiness of phrase, term _La beauté du\r\ndiable_. The eager eyes, dilated nostrils, parted lips, give that weird\r\nair of exaltation which, when it occurs, as it occasionally does in the\r\ndying, is interpreted as the result of glimpses into a spirit world.\r\nWhen to this is added the mild delirium of fever, when memories of\r\nhappier days and of those who have passed before rise unbidden and\r\nbabble themselves from the tongue, one can hardly wonder at this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nThe last group of lines to be noted is that about the eyes and\r\nforehead. These are less reliable than either of the other two, for the\r\nreason that they are so sympathetic as almost invariably to be present\r\nin addition, whenever the lower dial-plates of the face are disturbed.\r\nIt is only when they appear alone that they are significant; then they\r\nmay be interpreted as one of three things: first, and commonest, eye\r\nstrain; second, disease in some part of the nervous system or muscular\r\nsystem, not connected with the organs of the chest or abdomen; and\r\nthird, mental disturbances.\r\n\r\nThis last relation, of course, makes them in many respects the least\r\nreliable of all the face indices, because--as is household\r\nknowledge--they indicate mental conditions and operations, as well as\r\nbodily. \"The wrinkled brow of thought,\" the \"deep lines of perplexity,\"\r\netc., are in the vocabulary of the grammar grades. They are, however, a\r\nvaluable check upon the other two groups. They are not apt to be present\r\nin consumption and in other forms of serious disease, attended by fever,\r\non account of the curious effect produced by the toxins of the disease,\r\nwhich is often not only stimulating, but even of an exhilarating nature,\r\nor will produce a slight stupor or lethargy, such as is typical of\r\ntyphoid.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular transformations in the sick-room, especially in\r\nserious disease marked by lethargy or stupor, is that in which the\r\npatient's countenance will appear like a sponged-off slate, so\r\ncompletely have the lines of worry and of thought been obliterated.\r\n\r\nOne distinct value of the pain-lines about the eyes and brow is that you\r\ncan often test their genuineness. Just engage your hypochondriac or\r\nhysterical patient in lively conversation; or, on the reverse principle,\r\nwound his vanity, so as to produce an outburst of temper, and see how\r\nthe lines of undying agony will fade away and be replaced by the curves\r\nof amusement or by the straight-drawn brows of indignation.\r\n\r\nAs with the painter, next to line comes color. Every one, of course,\r\nknows that a fresh, rosy color is usually associated with health, while\r\na pale, sallow complexion suggests disease. But our color signals, while\r\nmore vivid, are much less reliable and more apt to deceive than our\r\nline-markings.\r\n\r\nSurprising as it may sound, careful analyses have shown, first, that the\r\nkind of pigment present in the human skin of every race is absolutely\r\none and the same. The only difference between the negro and the white\r\nman is that the negro has two or three times as much of it. Secondly,\r\nthat every skin except that of the albino has a certain, and usually a\r\nconsiderable, amount of this pigment present in it.\r\n\r\n\"The red hue of health\" is even more apt to mislead us, because, being\r\ndue to the abundance of blood in the meshes of the skin, many fevers, by\r\nincreasing the rapidity of the heart-beat and dilating the vessels in\r\nthe skin, give a ruddiness of hue equal to or in excess of the normal.\r\n\r\nHowever, a little careful checking up will eliminate most of the\r\npossible mistakes and enable us to obtain information of the greatest\r\nvalue from color. For instance, if our patient be of Southern blood, or\r\ntanned from the seashore, the good red blood in his arteries is pretty\r\nsafe to show through at the normal blush area on the cheeks; or, failing\r\nthat, through the translucent epithelium of the lips and gums. If, on\r\nthe other hand, this yellow tint be due to the escape of broken-down\r\nblood-pigments into the tissues, or a damming up of the bile, and a\r\nsimilar escape of its coloring matter, as in jaundice, then we turn to\r\nthe whites of the eyes, and if a similar, but more delicate, yellowish\r\ntint confronts us there, we know we have to deal with a severe form of\r\nanæmia or jaundice, according to the tint. In extreme cases of the\r\nlatter, the mucous membrane of the lips and of the gums will even show a\r\ndistinctly yellowish hue. The frightful color of yellow fever, and the\r\nyellow \"death mask,\" which appears just before the end of several fatal\r\nforms of blood poisoning, is due to the tremendous breaking down of the\r\nred cells of the blood under the attack of the fever toxins, and their\r\nleaking out into the tissues. A similar process of a milder and less\r\nserious extent occurs in those temporary anæmias of young girls, known\r\nfor centuries past in the vernacular as \"the green sickness.\" And a\r\ndelicate lemon tint of this same origin, accompanied by a waxy pallor,\r\nis significant of the deadly, pernicious anæmia and the later stages of\r\ncancer.\r\n\r\nThe most significant single thing about the red flush, supposed to be\r\nindicative of health, is its location. If this be the normal \"blush\r\narea,\" about the middle of each cheek,--which is one of nature's sexual\r\nornaments, placed, like a good advertisement, where it will attract most\r\nattention and add most beauty to the countenance,--and it fades off\r\ngradually at the edges into the clear whiteness or brownness of the\r\nhealthy skin, it is probably both healthy and genuine. If the work of\r\neither fever or of art, it will generally reveal itself as a base\r\nimitation. In eight cases out of ten of fever, the flush, instead of\r\nbeing confined to this definite area, extends all over the face, even up\r\nto the roots of the hair. The eyes, instead of being clear and bright,\r\nare congested and heavy-lidded; and if with these you have an increased\r\nrapidity of respiration, and a general air of discomfort and unrest, you\r\nare fairly safe in making a diagnosis of fever. If the first touch of\r\nthe tips of the fingers on the wrist shows a hot skin and a rapid pulse,\r\nthe diagnosis is almost as certain as with the thermometer.\r\n\r\nNow for two of the instances in which it most commonly puzzles us. The\r\nfirst of these is consumption; for here the flush, both in position and\r\nin delicacy and gentle fading away at the proper margins, is an almost\r\nperfect imitation of health. It, however, usually appears, not as the\r\nnormal flush of health does, upon a plump and rounded cheek, but upon a\r\nhollow and wasted one. It rises somewhat higher upon the cheekbones,\r\nthrowing the latter out into ghastly prominence. The lips and the eyes\r\nwill give us no clew, for the former are red from fever, and the latter\r\nare bright from the gentle, half-dreamy state produced by the toxins of\r\nthe disease, the so-called \"_spes phthisica_\"--the everlasting and\r\npathetic hopefulness of the consumptive. But here we call for help upon\r\nanother of the features of disease--the hand. If, instead of being cool,\r\nand elastic, this is either dry and hot, or clammy and damp, and feels\r\nas if you were grasping a handful of bones and nerves, and the\r\nfinger-tips are clubbed and the nails curved like claws, then you have a\r\nstrong _prima facie_ case.\r\n\r\nThe other color condition which is apt to puzzle us is that of the plump\r\nand comfortable middle-aged gentleman with a fine rosy color, but a\r\nwatery eye and loose and puffy mouth, a wheezy respiration and apparent\r\nexcess of adipose. Here the high color is often due to a paralytic\r\ndistention of the blood-vessels of the face and neck, and an examination\r\nof his heart and blood-vessels shows that his prospects are anything but\r\nas rosy as his countenance.\r\n\r\nThe varying expressions of the face of disease are by no means confined\r\nto the countenance. In fact, they extend to every portion of--in\r\nTrilby's immortal phrase--\"the altogether.\" Disease can speak most\r\neloquently through the hand, the carriage, the gait, and, in a way that\r\nthe patient may be entirely unconscious of, the voice. These forms of\r\nexpression are naturally not so frequent as those of the face, on\r\naccount of the extraordinary importance of the great systems whose\r\nclock-dials and indices form what we term the human countenance. But\r\nwhen they do occur they are fully as graphic and more definitely and\r\ndistinctively localizing.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the face comes the hand, and volumes have been\r\nwritten upon this alone. Containing, as it does, that throbbing little\r\nblood-tube, the radial artery, which has furnished us for centuries with\r\none of our oldest and most reliable guides to health conditions, the\r\npulse, it has played a most important part in surface diagnoses. To this\r\nday, in fact, Arabic and Turkish physicians in visiting their patients\r\non the feminine side of the family are allowed to see nothing of them\r\nexcept the hand, which is thrust through an opening in a curtain. How\r\naccurate their diagnoses are, based upon this slender clew, I should not\r\nlike to aver, but a sharp observer might learn much even from this\r\nlimited area.\r\n\r\nWe have--though, of course, in lesser degree--all the color and line\r\npictures with which we have been dealing upon the face. Though not an\r\nindex of any special system, it has the great advantage of being our one\r\napproach to an indication of the general muscular tone of the body, as\r\nindicated both in its grasp and in the poses it assumes at rest. The\r\npatient with a limp and nerveless hand-clasp, whose hand is inclined to\r\nlie palm upward and open instead of palm downward and half-closed, is\r\napt to be either seriously ill, or not in a position to make much of a\r\nfight against the attack of disease.\r\n\r\nThe nails furnish one of our best indices of the color of the blood and\r\ncondition of the circulation. Our best surface test of the vigor of the\r\ncirculation is to press upon a nail, or the back of the finger just\r\nabove it, until the blood is driven out of it, and when our thumb is\r\nremoved from the whitened area to note the rapidity with which the red\r\nfreshet of blood will rush back to reoccupy it.\r\n\r\nIn the natural growth of the nail, traveling steadily outward from root\r\nto free edge, its tissues, at first opaque and whitish, and thus\r\nforming the little white crescent, or _lunula_, found at the base of\r\nmost nails, gradually become more and more transparent, and hence pinker\r\nin color, from allowing the blood to show through. During a serious\r\nillness, the portion of the nail which is then forming suffers in its\r\nnutrition, and instead of going on normally to almost perfect\r\ntransparency, it remains opaque. And the patient will, in consequence,\r\ncarry a white bar across two or three of his nails for from three to\r\nnine months after the illness, according to the rate of growth of his\r\nnails. Not infrequently this white bar will enable you to ask a patient\r\nthe question, \"Did you not have a serious illness of some sort two,\r\nthree, or six months ago?\" according to the position of the bar. And his\r\nfearsome astonishment, if he answers your question in the affirmative,\r\nis amusing to see. You will be lucky if, in future, he doesn't incline\r\nto regard you as something uncanny and little less than a wizard.\r\n\r\nAnother of the score of interesting changes in the hand, which, though\r\nnot very common, is exceedingly significant when found, is a curious\r\nthickening or clubbing of the ends of the fingers, with extreme\r\ncurvature of the nails, which is associated with certain forms of\r\nconsumption. So long has it been recognized that it is known as the\r\n\"Hippocratic finger,\" on account of the vivid description given of it by\r\nthe Greek Father of Medicine, Hippocrates. It has lost, however, some of\r\nits exclusive significance, as it is found to be associated also with\r\ncertain diseases of the heart. It seems to mean obstructed circulation\r\nthrough the lungs.\r\n\r\nNext after the face and the hand would come the carriage and gait. When\r\na man is seriously sick he is sick all over. Every muscle in his body\r\nhas lost its tone, and those concerned with the maintenance of the erect\r\nposition, being last developed, suffer first and heaviest. The bowed\r\nback, the droop of the shoulders, the hanging jaw, and the shuffling\r\ngait, tell the story of chronic, wasting disease more graphically than\r\nwords. We have a ludicrously inverted idea of cause and effect in our\r\nminds about \"a good carriage.\" We imagine that a ramrod-like stiffening\r\nof the backbone, with the head erect, shoulders thrown back and chest\r\nprotruded, is a cause of health, instead of simply being an effect, or\r\none of the incidental symptoms thereof. And we often proceed to drill\r\nour unfortunate patients into this really cramped and irrational\r\nattitude, under the impression that by making them look better we shall\r\ncause them actually to become so. The head-erect, chest-out,\r\nfingers-down-the-seam-of-your trousers position of the drillmaster is\r\nlittle better than a pose intended chiefly for ornament, and has to be\r\nabandoned the moment that any attempt at movement or action is begun.\r\n\r\nSo complete is this unconscious muscular relaxation, that it is\r\nnoticeable not only in the standing and sitting position, but also when\r\nlying down. When a patient is exceedingly ill, and in the last state of\r\nenfeeblement, he cannot even lie straight in bed, but collapses into a\r\ncurled-up heap in the middle of the bed, the head even dropping from the\r\npillow and falling on the chest. Between this _débâcle_ and the slight\r\ndroop of shoulders and jaw indicative of beginning trouble there are a\r\nthousand shades of expression significant instantly to the experienced\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThough more limited in their application, yet most significant when\r\nfound, are the alterations of the gait itself. Even a maker of proverbs\r\ncan tell at a glance that \"the legs of the lame are not equal.\" From the\r\nlimp, coupled with the direction in which the toe or foot is turned, the\r\ntilt of the hips, the part of the foot that strikes first, the presence\r\nor absence of pain-lines on the face, a snap diagnosis can often be made\r\nas to whether the trouble is paralysis, hip-joint disease, knee or ankle\r\nmischief, or flatfoot, as your patient limps across the room. Even where\r\nboth limbs are affected and there is no distinct limp, the form of\r\nshuffle is often significant.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the forms of paralysis have each its significant gait. For\r\ninstance, if a patient comes in with a firm, rather precise, calculated\r\nsort of gait, \"clumping\" each foot upon the floor as if he had struck it\r\nan inch sooner than he had expected, and clamping it there firmly for a\r\nmoment before he lifts it again, as though he were walking on ice, with\r\nmore knee action than seems necessary, you would have a strong suspicion\r\nthat you had to deal with a case of _locomotor ataxia_, in which loss of\r\nsensation in the soles of the feet is one of the earliest symptoms. If\r\nso, your patient, on inquiry, will tell you that he feels as if there\r\nwere a blanket or even a board between his soles and the surface on\r\nwhich he steps. If a quick glance at the pupils shows both smaller or\r\nlarger than normal, and on turning his face to the light they fail to\r\ncontract, your suspicion is confirmed; while if, on asking him to be\r\nseated and cross his legs, a tap on the great extensor tendon of the\r\nknee-joint just below the patella fails to elicit any quick upward jerk\r\nof the foot, the so-called \"knee-kick,\" then you may be almost sure of\r\nyour diagnosis, and proceed to work it out at your leisure.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if an elderly gentleman enters with a curiously blank\r\nand rather melancholy expression of countenance, holding his cane out\r\nstiffly in front of him, and comes toward you at a rapid, toddling gait,\r\nthrowing his feet forward in quick, short steps, as if, if he failed to\r\ndo so, he would fall on his face, while at the same time a vibrating\r\ntremor carries his head quickly from side to side, you are justified in\r\nsuspecting that you have to do with a case of _paralysis agitans_, or\r\nshaking palsy.\r\n\r\nLast of all, your physiognomy of disease includes not merely its face,\r\nbut its voice; not only the picture that it draws, but the sound that it\r\nmakes. For, when all has been allowed and discounted that the most\r\nhardened cynic or pessimistic agnostic can say about speech being given\r\nto man to conceal his thoughts, and the hopeless unreliability of human\r\ntestimony, two-thirds of what your patients tell you about their\r\nsymptoms will be found to be literally the voice of the disease itself\r\nspeaking through them. They may tell you much that is chiefly imaginary,\r\nbut even imagination has got to have some physical basis as a\r\nstarting-point. They may tell you much that is clearly and ludicrously\r\nirrelevant, or untrue, on account of inaccuracy of observation,\r\nconfusion of cause and effect, or a mental color-blindness produced by\r\nthe disease itself. But these things can all be brushed aside like the\r\nchaff from the wheat if checked up by the picture of the disease in\r\nplain sight before you.\r\n\r\nIn the main, the great mass of what patients tell you is of great value\r\nand importance, and, with proper deductions, perfectly reliable. In\r\nfact, I think it would be safe to say that a sharp observer would be\r\nable to make a fairly and approximately accurate diagnosis in seven\r\ncases out of ten, simply by what his eye and his touch tell him while\r\nlistening to symptoms recounted by the patient. Time and again have I\r\nseen an examination made of a reasonably intelligent patient, and when\r\nthe recital had been finished and the hawk-like gaze had traveled from\r\nhead to foot and back again, from ear-tip to finger-nail, from eye to\r\nchest, a symptom which the patient had simply forgotten to mention would\r\nbe promptly supplied; and the gasp with which the patient would\r\nacknowledge the truth of the suggestion was worth traveling miles to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nOf course, you pay no attention to any statement of the patient which\r\nflatly contradicts the evidence of your own senses. But even where\r\npatients, through some preconceived notion, or from false ideas of shame\r\nor discredit attaching to some particular disease, are trying to mislead\r\nyou, the very vigor of their efforts will often reveal their secret,\r\njust as the piteous broken-winged utterings of the mother partridge\r\nreveal instantly to the eye of the bird-lover the presence of the young\r\nwhich she is trying to lure him away from. Only let a patient talk\r\nenough about his or her symptoms, and the truth will leak out.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of impatient incredulity toward the stories of our\r\npatients, typified by the story of that great surgeon, but greater bear,\r\nDr. John Abernethy, has passed, never to return. When a lady of rank\r\ncame into his consulting-room, and, having drawn off her wraps and\r\ncomfortably settled herself in her chair, launched out into a luxurious\r\nrecital of symptoms, including most of her family history and\r\nadventures, he, after listening about ten minutes pulled out his watch\r\nand looked at it. The lady naturally stopped, open-mouthed. \"Madam, how\r\nlong do you think it will take you to complete the recital of your\r\nsymptoms?\" \"Oh, well,\"--the lady floundered, embarrassed,--\"I hardly\r\nknow.\" \"Well, do you think you could finish in three-quarters of an\r\nhour?\" Well, she supposed she could, probably. \"Very well, madam. I have\r\nan operation at the hospital in the next street. Pray continue with the\r\nrecital of your symptoms, and I will return in three-quarters of an hour\r\nand proceed with the consideration of your case!\"\r\n\r\nWhen you can spare the time,--and no time is wasted which is spent in\r\ngetting a thorough and exhaustive knowledge of a serious case,--it is as\r\ngood as a play to let even your hypochondriac patients, and those who\r\nare suffering chiefly from \"nervous prosperity\" in its most acute form,\r\nset forth their agonies and their afflictions in their fullest and most\r\nluxurious length, breadth, and thickness, watching meanwhile the come\r\nand go of the lines about the face-dials, the changes of the color, the\r\nsparkling and dulling of the eye, the droop or pain-cramp, or luxurious\r\nloll of each group of muscles, and quietly draw your own conclusions\r\nfrom it all. Many and many a time, in the full luxury of\r\nself-explanation, they will reveal to you a clew which will prove to be\r\nthe master-key to your control of the situation, and their restoration\r\nto comfort, if not health, which you couldn't have got in a week of\r\nforceps-and-scalpel cross-examination.\r\n\r\nIn only one class of patients is this valuable aid to knowledge absent,\r\nand that is in very young children; and yet, by what may at first sight\r\nseem like a paradox, they are, of all others, the easiest in whom to\r\nmake not merely a provisional, but a final, diagnosis. They cannot yet\r\ntalk with their tongues and their lips, but they speak a living language\r\nin every line, every curve, every tint of their tiny, translucent\r\nbodies, from their little pink toes to the soft spot on the top of their\r\ndowny heads. Not only have they all the muscle-signs about the\r\nface-dial, of pain or of comfort, but, also, these are absolutely\r\nuncomplicated by any cross-currents of what their elders are pleased to\r\nterm \"thought.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a baby knits his brows he is not puzzling over his political\r\nchances or worrying about his immortal soul. He has got a pain somewhere\r\nin his little body. When his vocal organs emit sounds, whether the\r\ngurgle or coo of comfort, or the yell of dissatisfaction, they are just\r\nsqueezed out of him by the pressure of his own internal sensations, and\r\nhe is never talking just to hear himself talk. Further than this, his\r\ncolor is so exquisitely responsive to every breath of change in his\r\ninterior mechanism, that watching his face is almost like observing a\r\nreaction in a test-tube, with its precipitate, or change of color. In\r\naddition, not only will he turn pale or flush, and his little muscles\r\ncontract or relax, but so elastic are the tissues of his surface, and so\r\nabundant the mesh of blood-vessels just underneath, that, under the\r\nstroke of serious illness, he will literally shrivel like a green leaf\r\npicked from its stem, or wilt like a faded flower.\r\n\r\nA single glance at the tiny face on the cot pillow is usually enough to\r\ntell you whether or not the little morsel is seriously ill. Nothing\r\ncould be further from the truth than the prevailing impression that,\r\nbecause babies can't talk, it is impossible, especially for a young\r\ndoctor, to find out what is the matter with them. If they can't talk,\r\nneither can they tell lies, and when they yell \"Pin!\" they mean pin and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the popular impression of the puzzled discomfiture of the\r\ndoctor before a very small, ailing baby is about as rational as the\r\nattitude of a good Quaker lady in a little Western country town, who had\r\ninduced her husband to subscribe liberally toward the expenses of a\r\ncertain missionary on the West Coast of Africa. On his return, the\r\nmissionary brought her as a mark of his gratitude a young half-grown\r\nparrot, of one of the good talking breeds. The good lady, though\r\ndelighted, was considerably puzzled with the gift, and explained to a\r\nfriend of mine that she really didn't know what to feed it, and it\r\nwasn't quite old enough to be able to talk and tell her what it wanted!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOLDS AND HOW TO CATCH THEM\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient vibrations are hard to stop, and still harder to control.\r\nWhether they date from our driving back by the polar ice-sheet, together\r\nwith our titanic Big Game, the woolly rhinoceros, the mammoth, and the\r\nsabre-toothed tiger, from our hunting-grounds in Siberia and Norway, or\r\nfrom recollections of hunting parties pushing north from our tropical\r\nbirth-lands, and getting trapped and stormbound by the advance of the\r\nstrange giant, Winter, certain it is that our subconsciousness is full\r\nof ancestral memories which send a shiver through our very marrow at the\r\nmere mention of \"cold\" or \"sleet\" or \"wintry blasts.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest dawn of legend cold has always been ranked, with\r\nhunger and pestilence and storm, as one of the demons to be dreaded and\r\nfought. And, at a little later date, the ancient songs and sayings of\r\nevery people have been full of quaint warnings against the danger of a\r\nchill, a draft, wet feet, or damp sheets. There is, of course, a\r\nbitterly substantial basis for this feeling, as the dozens of stiffened\r\nforms whose only winding-sheet was the curling snowdrift, or whose\r\ncoffin the frozen sleet, bear ghastly witness. It was, however, long ago\r\ndiscovered that when we were properly fed and clothed, the Cold Demon\r\ncould be absolutely defied, even in a tiny hut made out of pressed snow\r\nand warmed by a smoky seal-blubber lamp; that the Storm King could be\r\nbaffled just by burrowing into his own snowdrifts and curling up under\r\nthe crust, like an Eskimo dog. Hence, nearly all the legends depict the\r\nhero as finally conquering the Storm King, like Shingebis in the Song of\r\nHiawatha.\r\n\r\nThe ancient terror, however, still clings, with a hold the more\r\ntenacious as it becomes narrowed, to one large group of these calamities\r\nbelieved to be produced by cold,--namely, those diseases supposed to be\r\ncaused by exposure to the weather. Even here, it still has a\r\nconsiderable basis in fact; but the general trend of opinion among\r\nthoughtful physicians is that this basis is much narrower than was at\r\none time supposed, and is becoming still more restricted with the\r\nprogress of scientific knowledge. For instance, fifty years ago, popular\r\nopinion, and even the majority of medical belief, was that consumption\r\nand all of its attendant miseries were chiefly due to exposure to cold.\r\nNow we know that, on the contrary, abundance of pure, fresh, cold air is\r\nthe best cure for the disease, and foul air and overcrowding its chief\r\ncause. An almost equally complete about-face has been executed in regard\r\nto pneumonia. Prolonged and excessive exposure to cold may be the match\r\nthat fires the mine, but we are absolutely certain that two other things\r\nare necessary, namely, the presence of the diplococcus, and a lowered\r\nand somewhat vitiated state of bodily resistance, due to age, overwork,\r\nunderfeeding, or over-indulgence in alcohol.\r\n\r\nNot only do these two diseases not occur in the land of perpetual cold,\r\nthe frozen North, except where they are introduced by civilized\r\nvisitors,--and scarce a single death from pneumonia has ever yet\r\noccurred in the crew of an Arctic expedition,--but it has actually been\r\nproposed to fit up a ship for a summer trip through the Arctic regions,\r\nas a floating sanatorium for consumptives, on account of the purity of\r\nthe air and the brilliancy of the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThere is one realm, however, where the swing of this ancient\r\nsuperstition vibrates with fullest intensity, and that is in those\r\ndiseases which, as their name implies, are still believed to be due to\r\nexposure to a lowered temperature--\"common colds.\" Here again it has a\r\ncertain amount of rational basis, but this is growing less and less\r\nevery day. The present attitude of thoughtful physicians may be\r\ngraphically indicated by the flippant inquiry of the riddle-maker, \"When\r\nis a cold not a cold?\" and the answer, \"Two-thirds of the time.\" This\r\nmuch we are certain of already: that the majority of so-called \"colds\"\r\nhave little or nothing to do with exposure to a low temperature, that\r\nthey are entirely misnamed, and that a better term for them would be\r\n_fouls_. In fact, this proportion can be clearly and definitely proved\r\nand traced as infections spreading from one victim to another. The best\r\nplace to catch them is not out-of-doors, or even in drafty hallways, but\r\nin close, stuffy, infected hotel bedrooms, sleeping-cars, churches, and\r\ntheatres.\r\n\r\nTwo arguments in rebuttal will at once be brought forward, both\r\napparently conclusive. One is that colds are vastly more frequent in\r\nwinter, and the other that when you sit in a draft until you feel\r\nchilly, you inevitably have a cold afterward. Both these arguments\r\nalike, however, are based upon a misunderstanding. The frequency of\r\ncolds in winter is chiefly due to the fact that, at this time of the\r\nyear, we crowd into houses and rooms, shutting the doors and windows in\r\norder to keep warm, and thus provide a ready-made hothouse for the\r\ncultivation and transmission from one to another of the influenza and\r\nother bacilli. As the brilliant young English pulmonary expert, Dr.\r\nLeonard Williams, puts it, \"a constant succession of colds implies a\r\nmode of life in which all aërial microbes are afforded abundant\r\nopportunities.\" At the same time, we take less exercise and sit far less\r\nin the open air, thus lowering our general vigor and resisting power and\r\nmaking us more susceptible to attack. Those who live out-of-doors winter\r\nand summer, and who ventilate their houses properly, even in cold\r\nweather, suffer comparatively little more from colds in the winter-time\r\nthan they do in summer; although, of course, the most vigorous\r\nindividual, in the best ventilated surroundings, will occasionally\r\nsuccumb to some particularly virulent infection.\r\n\r\nThe second fact of experience, catching cold after sitting in a draft or\r\na chilly room until you begin to cough or sneeze, is one to which a\r\nmajority of us would be willing to testify personally, and yet it is\r\nbased upon something little better than an illusion. It is a well-known\r\npeculiarity of many fevers and infections to begin with a chill. The\r\npatient complains of shiverings up and down his spine, his fingernails\r\nand his lips become blue, in extreme cases his teeth chatter, and his\r\nlimbs begin to twitch and shake, and he ends up in a typical ague fit.\r\nThe best known, because most striking, illustration is malaria, or fever\r\nand ague, \"chills and fever,\" as it is variously termed. But this form\r\nof attack, milder and much slighter in degree, may occur in almost every\r\nknown infection, such as pneumonia, typhoid, tuberculosis, scarlet\r\nfever, measles, and influenza. It has nothing whatever to do with either\r\nexternal or internal temperature; for if you slip a fever-thermometer\r\nunder your chilling patient's tongue, it will usually register anywhere\r\nfrom 102 to 105°.\r\n\r\nThis method of attack is especially common, not only in influenza, but\r\nalso in all the other so-called \"common colds.\" In fact, when we begin\r\nto shiver and sneeze and hunt around for an imaginary draft or lowering\r\nof the temperature which has caused it, we are actually in the first\r\nstage of the development of an infection which was contracted hours, or\r\neven days, before.\r\n\r\nWhen you begin to shiver and sneeze and run at the eyes you are not\r\n\"catching\" cold; you have already caught it long before, and it is\r\nbeginning to break out on you. Mere exposure to cold will never cause\r\nsneezing. It takes a definite irritation of the nasal mucous membrane,\r\nby gas or dust from without, or toxins from within, to produce a sneeze.\r\n\r\nAs to mere exposure to cold weather and wet and storm being able to\r\nproduce it, it is the almost unanimous testimony of Arctic explorers\r\nthat, during their sojourn of from two to three years in the frozen\r\nNorth, they never had so much as a sneeze or a sore throat, even though\r\nfrequently sheltered in extemporized huts, and running short of adequate\r\nfood-supply before spring. Within a week of their return to civilization\r\nthey would begin sneezing and coughing, and catch furious colds.\r\n\r\nLumbermen, trappers, hunters, and prospectors in Alaska give similar\r\ntestimony. I have talked with scores of these pioneers, visiting them,\r\nin fact, in their camps under conditions of wet, cold, and exposure that\r\nwould have made one afraid of either pneumonia or rheumatism before\r\nmorning, and found that, so long as they remained up in the mountains or\r\nout in the snow, and no case of influenza, sore throat, or cold happened\r\nto be brought into the camp, they would be entirely free from coughs and\r\ncolds; but that, upon returning to civilization and sleeping in the\r\nstuffy room of a rude frontier hotel, they would frequently catch cold\r\nwithin three days.\r\n\r\nOne unusually intelligent foreman of a lumber camp in Oregon told me\r\nthat an experience of this kind had occurred to him three different\r\ntimes that he could distinctly recollect.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to catch a cold or pneumonia unless the bacilli are\r\nthere to be caught. Boswell has embalmed for us, in the amber of his\r\nmatchless biography, the fact that it had been noted, even in those\r\ndays, that the inhabitants of one of the Faroe Islands never had colds\r\nin the head except on the rare occasions when a ship would touch\r\nthere--usually not oftener than once a year. Then, within a week, half\r\nthe population would be blowing and sneezing. The great Samuel commented\r\nupon the fact at length, and advanced the ingenious explanation that, as\r\nthe harbor was so difficult of entry, the ships could beat in only when\r\nthe wind was in a certain quarter, and that quarter was the nor'east.\r\n_Hinc illæ lacrimæ!_ (Hence these weeps!) The colds were caused by the\r\nnortheast wind of unsavory reputation! How often the wind got into the\r\nnortheast without bringing a ship or colds he apparently did not\r\nspeculate.\r\n\r\nTo come nearer yet, did you ever catch cold when camping out? I have\r\nwaked in the morning with the snow drifting across the back of my neck,\r\nbeen wet to the skin all day, and gone to bed in my wet clothes, and\r\nslept myself dry; and have lain out all day in a November gale, in a\r\nhollow scooped in the half-frozen ground of the duck-marsh, and felt\r\nnever a hair the worse. Scores of similar experiences will rise up in\r\nthe minds of every camper, hunter, or fisherman. You _may_ catch cold\r\nduring the first day or two out, before you have got the foul city air,\r\nwith its dust and bacteria, out of your lungs and throat, but even this\r\nrarely happens.\r\n\r\nHow seldom one catches cold from swimming, no matter how cold the water;\r\nor from boating, or fishing,--even without the standard prophylactic; or\r\nfrom picnicking, or anything that is done during a day in the open air.\r\n\r\nSo much for the negative side of the evidence, that colds are not often\r\ncaught where infectious materials are absent. Now for the positive side.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, that typical cold of colds, influenza, or the grip, is now\r\nunanimously admitted by authorities to be a pure infection, due to a\r\ndefinite germ (the _bacillus influenzæ_ of Pfeiffer) and one of the most\r\ncontagious diseases known. Each of the great epidemics of it--1830-33,\r\n1836-37, 1847-48, and, of most vivid and unblessed memory, 1889-90--can\r\nbe traced in its stately march completely across the civilized world,\r\nbeginning, as do nearly all our world-epidemics,--cholera, plague,\r\ninfluenza, etc.,--in China, and spreading, _via_ India or Turkestan, to\r\nRussia, Berlin, London, New York, Chicago. Moreover, its rate of\r\nprogress is precisely that of the means of travel: camel-train,\r\npost-chaise, railway, as the case may be. The earlier epidemics took two\r\nyears to spread from Eastern Russia to New York; the later ones, forty\r\nto sixty days. Soon it will beat Jules Verne or George Francis Train. So\r\nintensely \"catching\" is it, that letters written by sufferers have been\r\nknown to infect the correspondents who received them in a distant town,\r\nand become the starting-point of a local epidemic.\r\n\r\nOf course, it may be urged that when we have proved the grip to be a\r\ndefinite infection, we have taken it out of the class of \"colds\"\r\naltogether, and that its bacterial origin proves nothing in regard to\r\nthe rest. But a rather interesting state of affairs developed during the\r\nsearch for the true bacillus of influenza: this was that a dozen other\r\nbacilli and cocci were discovered, each of which seemed capable of\r\ncausing all the symptoms of the _grip_, though in milder form. So that\r\nthe view of the majority of pathologists now is that these\r\n\"influenzoid,\" or \"grip-like\" attacks, under which come a majority of\r\nall _common colds_, are probably due to a number of different milder\r\nmicro-organisms.\r\n\r\nThe next fact in favor of the infectious character of a cold is that it\r\nbegins with a chill, followed with a fever, runs a definite self-limited\r\ncourse, and, barring complications, gets well of itself in a certain\r\ntime, just like the measles, scarlet fever, pneumonia, or any other\r\nfrank infection.\r\n\r\nColds are also followed by inflammations, or toxic attacks in other\r\norgans of the body, lungs, stomach, bowels, heart, kidneys, nerves,\r\netc., just like diphtheria, scarlet fever, or typhoid, only, of course,\r\nof milder form and less frequently.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least practically convincing, colds may be traced from one\r\nvictim to another, may \"run through\" households, schools, factories, may\r\noccur after attending church or theatre, may be checked by isolating the\r\nsufferers; and are now most effectually treated by the inhalation of\r\nnon-poisonous germicidal or antiseptic vapors and sprays.\r\n\r\nOne of my first experiences with this last method occurred in a most\r\nunexpected field. An old friend, a most interesting and intelligent\r\nGerman, was the proprietor of a wild-animal depot, importing foreign\r\nanimals and birds and selling them to the zoölogical gardens and\r\ncircuses. I used often to drop in there to see if he had anything new,\r\nand he would come up to see me, to tell me his troubles and keep my\r\ndissecting-table supplied with interestingly diseased dead beasts and\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nOne day he came up in a state of great excitement, with a very dead and\r\ndilapidated parrot in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Choost look, Dogdor; here's one of dose measley new pollies I god in\r\nfrom Zingapore. De rest iss coffin' an' sneezin' to plow dere peaks off,\r\nan' all de utter caitches iss kitchen him.\"\r\n\r\nAs parrots are worth from fifteen to thirty dollars apiece, \"green\" (not\r\nin color, but training), and he had fifty or sixty in the store, the\r\nsituation was distinctly serious. Now, I was no specialist in the\r\npeculiar diseases of parrots, but something had to be done, and, with a\r\nboldness born of long practice, I drew my bow at a venture and let fly\r\nthis suggestion:--\r\n\r\n\"Try formalin; it's pretty fierce on the eyes and nose, but it won't\r\nkill 'em; and, if you put a teaspoonful in the bottom of each cage, by\r\nthe time it evaporates no germ that gets into that cage will live long\r\nenough to do any harm.\"\r\n\r\nFive days later back he came, red-eyed but triumphant. \"Dogdor, dot\r\nvormaleen iss de pest shtuff I effer saw. It mos' shteenk me out of de\r\nshtore, an' de pollies nearly sneeze dere fedders off, but it shtopt de\r\nspret, an' _it's cureenall de seek ones_, an' I het a cold in de het,\r\n_an' it's curt me_.\"\r\n\r\nBefore using it he had fourteen cases and three deaths; after, only\r\nthree new cases and no more deaths. I would, however, hardly advise any\r\nhuman \"coldie\" to try such heroic treatment offhand, for the pungency\r\nand painfulness of formalin vapor is something ferocious, though the\r\nFrench physicians, with characteristic courage, are making extensive use\r\nof it for this purpose, with excellent results under careful\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nAnother curious straw pointing in the direction of the infectious nature\r\nof colds is the \"annual cold,\" or \"yearly sore throat,\" from which many\r\nof us suffer. When we have had it we usually feel fairly safe from colds\r\nfor some months at least, often for a year. The only explanation that\r\nseems in the least to explain is that colds, like other infections,\r\nconfer an immunity against another attack; only, unlike scarlet fever,\r\nmeasles, smallpox, etc., this immunity, instead of for life, is only for\r\nsix months or a year. This immunity is due to the formation in the blood\r\nof protective substances known as _anti-bodies_, which destroy or render\r\nharmless the invading germs. Flabby, under-ventilated individuals, who\r\nare always \"catching cold,\" have such weak resisting powers that they\r\nform hardly enough anti-bodies to terminate the first attack, without\r\nhaving enough left to protect them from another for more than a few\r\nweeks or months. Dr. Leonard Williams describes chronic cold-catchers as\r\n\"people who wear flannel next their skins, ... who know they are in a\r\ndraft because it makes them sneeze; who, in short, live thoroughly\r\nunwholesome, coddling lives.\" Strong and vigorous individuals may form\r\nenough to last them a year, or even two years.\r\n\r\nNow comes the question, \"What are we going to do about it?\" Obviously,\r\nwe cannot \"go gunning\" for these countless billions of germs, of\r\nfifteen or twenty different species. Nor can we quarantine every one who\r\nhas a cold. Fortunately, no such radical methods are necessary. All we\r\nhave to do is to take nature's hint of the anti-bodies and improve upon\r\nit. Healthy cells can grow fat on a diet of such germs, and, if we keep\r\nourselves vigorous, clean, and well ventilated, we can practically defy\r\nthe \"cold\" devil and all his works.\r\n\r\nHere is the _leitmotif_ of the whole fascinating drama of infection and\r\nimmunity. We can study only one phrasing here. We shall, of course,\r\ncatch cold occasionally, but will throw it off quickly, and probably\r\nform anti-bodies enough to last us a year or more. How can this be done?\r\nFirst and foremost, by living and sleeping as much as possible in the\r\nopen air. This helps in several different ways. First, by increasing the\r\nvigor and resisting power of our bodies; second, by helping to burn up,\r\nclean, and rid our tissues of waste products which are poisons if\r\nretained; third, by greatly reducing the risks of infection.\r\n\r\nYou can't catch cold by sitting in a field exposed to the draft from an\r\nopen gate; though I understand that casuists of the old school of the\r\n\"chill-and-damp\" theory of colds are still discussing the case of the\r\npatient who \"caught his death o' cold\" by having his gruel served in a\r\ndamp basin.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to get the outdoor habit. This takes time to\r\nacquire, but, once formed, you wouldn't exchange it for anything else on\r\nearth. The next thing is to learn to sit or sleep in a gentle current of\r\nair all the time you are indoors. You ought to feel uncomfortable\r\nunless you can feel air blowing across your face night and day. Then you\r\nare reasonably sure it is fresh, and it is the only way to be sure of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBut drafts are so dangerous! As the old rhyme runs,\r\n\r\n  But when a draft blows through a hole,\r\n  Make your will and mend your soul.\r\n\r\nPure superstition! It just shows what's in a name. Call it a gentle\r\nbreeze, or a current of fresh air, and no one is afraid of it. Call it a\r\n\"draft,\" and up go hands and eyebrows in horror at once. One of our\r\nhighest authorities on diseases of the lungs, Dr. Norman Bridge, has\r\nwell dubbed it \"The Draft Fetich.\" It is a fetich, and as murderous as\r\nMoloch. The draft is a friend instead of an enemy. What converted most\r\nof us to a belief in the beneficence of drafts was the open-air\r\ntreatment of consumption! Hardly could there have been a more\r\nspectacular proof, a more dramatic defiance of the bogey. To make a\r\npoor, wasted, shivering consumptive, in a hectic one hour and a\r\ndrenching sweat the next, lie out exposed to the November weather all\r\nday and sleep in a ten-knot gale at night! It looked little short of\r\nmurder! So much so to some of us, that we decided to test it on\r\nourselves before risking our patients.\r\n\r\nI can still vividly recall the astonishment with which I woke one frosty\r\nDecember morning, after sleeping all night in a breeze across my head\r\nthat literally made\r\n\r\n  Each particular hair to stand on end,\r\n  Like quills upon the fretful porcupine,\r\n\r\nnot only without the sign of a sniffle, but feeling as if I'd been made\r\nnew while I slept.\r\n\r\nThen we tried it in fear and trembling on our patients, and the delight\r\nof seeing the magic it worked! That is an old story now, but it has\r\nnever lost its charm. To see the cough which has defied \"dopes\" and\r\nsyrups and cough mixtures, domestic, patent, and professional, for\r\nmonths, subside and disappear in from three to ten days; the night\r\nsweats dry up within a week; the appetite come back; the fever fall; the\r\nstrength and color return, as from the magic kiss of the free air of the\r\nwoods, the prairies, the seacoast. There's nothing else quite like it on\r\nthe green earth. Do you wonder that we become \"fresh-air fiends\"?\r\n\r\nThe only thing we dread in these camps is the imported \"cold.\" Dr.\r\nLawrence Flick was the first to show us the way in this respect as in\r\nseveral others. He put up a big sign at the entrance of White Haven\r\nSanatorium, \"No persons suffering from colds allowed to enter,\" and\r\ntraced the only epidemic of colds in the sanatorium to the visit of a\r\nbutcher with the grip. I put up a similar sign at the gate of my Oregon\r\ncamp, and never had a patient catch cold from tenting out in the snow\r\nand \"Oregon mists\" until the small son of the cook came back from the\r\nvillage school, shivering and sneezing, when seven of the thirteen\r\npatients \"caught it\" within a week.\r\n\r\nWhat will cure a consumptive will surely not kill a healthy man. I am\r\ndelighted to say that it shows signs of becoming a fad now, and sleeping\r\nporches are being put on houses all over the country. No house in\r\nCalifornia is considered complete without them. The ideal bedroom is a\r\nsmall dressing-room, opening on a wide screened porch, or balcony, with\r\na door wide enough to allow the bed to be rolled inside during storms or\r\nin severest weather.\r\n\r\nSleep on a porch, or in a room with windows on two sides wide open, and\r\nthe average living-room or office begins to feel stuffy and \"smothery\"\r\nat once. Apply the same treatment here. Learn to sit in a gentle draft,\r\nand you'll avoid two-thirds of your colds and three-fourths of your\r\nheadaches. It may be necessary in winter to warm the draft, but don't\r\nlet any patent method of ventilation delude you into keeping your\r\nwindows shut any hour of the day or night.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, don't fall into the widespread delusion that because\r\nair is cold it is necessarily pure. Some of the vilest air imaginable is\r\nthat shut up in those sepulchres known as \"best bedrooms,\" which chill\r\nyour very marrow. The rheumatism or snuffles you get from sleeping\r\nbetween their icy sheets comes from the crop of bacilli which has lurked\r\nthere since they were last aired. The \"no heat in a bedroom\" dogma is\r\nlittle better than superstition, born of those fecund parents which mate\r\nso often, stinginess and puritanism. Practically, the room which will\r\n_never_ have a window opened in it in winter is the one without any\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the air in an underheated church, hall, or theatre is almost\r\nsure to be foul. The janitor will keep every opening closed in order to\r\nget the temperature up. Some churches are never once decently ventilated\r\nfrom December to May. The same old air, with an ever richer crop of\r\ngerms, is reheated and served up again every Sunday. The \"odor of\r\nsanctity\" is the residue of the breaths and perspiration of successive\r\ngenerations. Cleanliness may be next to godliness, but it is sometimes\r\nan astonishingly long step behind it.\r\n\r\nThe next important step is to keep clean, both externally and\r\ninternally: externally, by cold bathing, internally, by exercise. The\r\nonly reason why a draft ever hurts us is because we are full of\r\nself-poisons, or germs. The self-poisons can be best got rid of by\r\nabundant exercise in the open air and plenty of pure, cold H2O,\r\ninternally and externally.\r\n\r\nFood has very little to do with these autotoxins, and they are as likely\r\nto form on one diet as another. In fact, they form normally and in\r\nstates of perfect health, and are poisonous only if retained too long.\r\nIt is simply a question of burning them up, and getting rid of them\r\nquickly enough, by exercise, with its attendant deep breathing and\r\nperspiration. The lungs are great garbage-burners. Exercise every day\r\ntill you puff and sweat.\r\n\r\nA blast of cold air suddenly stops the escape of these poisons through\r\nthe skin and throws them on the lungs, liver, or kidneys. The resulting\r\ndisturbance is the second commonest form of a \"cold,\" and covers perhaps\r\na third of all cases occurring. This is the cold that can be prevented\r\nby the cold bath. Keep the skin hardened and toned up to such a pitch\r\nthat no reasonable chill will stop it from excreting, and you are safe.\r\nNever depend on clothing. The more you pile on, the more you choke and\r\n\"flabbify\" the skin and make it ready to \"strike\" on the first breath of\r\ncold air. Too heavy flannels are cold-breeders, and chest-protectors\r\ninventions of the evil one. Trust the skin; it is one of the most\r\nimportant and toughest organs in the body, if only given half a chance.\r\n\r\nBut the most frequent way in which drafts precipitate a cold is by\r\ntemporarily lowering the vital resistance. This gives the swarms of\r\ngerms present almost constantly in our noses, throats, stomachs, bowels,\r\netc., the chance they have been looking for--to break through the cell\r\nbarrier and run riot in the body.\r\n\r\nSo long as the pavement-cells of our mucous membranes are healthy, they\r\ncan keep them out indefinitely. Lower their tone by cold, fatigue,\r\nunderfeeding, and their line is pierced in a dozen places at once. One\r\nof the many horrifying things which bacteriology has revealed is that\r\nour bodies are simply alive with germs, even in perfect health. One\r\nenthusiastic dentist has discovered and described no less than\r\n_thirty-three_ distinct species, each one numbering its billions, which\r\ninhabit our gums and teeth. Our noses, our stomachs, our\r\nintestines,--each boasts a similar population. Most of them do no harm\r\nat all; indeed, some probably assist in the processes of digestion;\r\nothers are camp-followers, living on our leavings; others, captive\r\nenemies which have been clubbed into peaceful behavior by our leucocyte\r\nand anti-body police.\r\n\r\nFor instance, not a few healthy noses and throats contain the bacillus\r\nof diphtheria and the diplococcus of pneumonia. We are beginning to find\r\nthat these last two groups will bear watching. Like camp-followers\r\nelsewhere, they carry knives, and are not above using them on the\r\nwounded after dark. In fact, they have a cheerful habit of taking a\r\nhand in any disturbance that starts in their bailiwick, and usually on\r\nthe side against the body-cells.\r\n\r\nFinally, while clearly realizing that the best defense is attack, and\r\nthat our chief reliance should be upon keeping ourselves in such\r\nfighting trim that we can \"eat 'em alive\" at any time, there is no sense\r\nin running easily avoidable risks, and we should keep away from\r\ninfection as far as possible. If a child comes to school heavy-eyed,\r\nhoarse, and snuffling, the teacher should send him home at once. He will\r\nonly waste his time attempting to study in that trim, and may infect a\r\nscore of others. Moreover, it may be remarked, parenthetically, that\r\nthese are also symptoms of the beginning of measles, scarlet fever, and\r\ndiphtheria, and two-thirds of all cases of these would be sent home\r\nbefore they could infect any one else if this procedure were the rule.\r\n\r\nIf your own child develops a cold, if mild, keep him playing\r\nout-of-doors by himself; or if severe, keep him in bed, in a\r\nwell-ventilated room, for three or four days. He'll get better twice as\r\nquick as if at school, and the rest of the household will escape.\r\n\r\nWhen you wake with a stuffed head and aching bones, stay at home for a\r\nfew days if possible, out of regard for your customers, your\r\nfellow-clerks, or your office force, as well as yourself. If one of your\r\nemployees comes to work shivering, give him three days' vacation on full\r\npay. If it runs through the force, you'll lose five times as much in\r\nenforced sick-leaves, slowness, and mistakes. Above all, don't go to any\r\npublic gatherings,--to church, the theatre, or parties,--when you are\r\nsnuffling and coughing. You are not exactly a joy to your beholders,\r\neven if you don't infect them. It is advisable, and well worth the\r\ntrifling trouble and expense, to fumigate thoroughly with formalin all\r\nchurches, theatres, and schoolrooms at least once a month. Reasonable\r\nand public-spirited precautions of this sort are advisable, not only to\r\navoid colds themselves, which are disagreeable and dangerous enough, but\r\nbecause mild infections of this sort are far the commonest single means\r\nof making a breach in our body-ramparts through which more serious\r\ndiseases like consumption, pneumonia, and rheumatism may force an entry.\r\n\r\nColds do not \"run into\" consumption or pneumonia, but they bear much the\r\nsame relation to them that good intentions are said to do to the\r\ninfernal regions. They release the lid of a perfect Pandora's box of\r\ndistempers--tuberculosis, pneumonia, rheumatism, bronchitis, Bright's\r\ndisease, neuritis, endocarditis. A cold is no longer a joke. A\r\ngeneration ago a prominent physician was asked by an anxious mother,\r\n\"Doctor, how would you treat a cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"With contempt, madam,\" replied the great man.\r\n\r\nThat day is past, and has lasted too long. Intelligently regarded and\r\nhandled, they are the least harmful of diseases; neglected, one of the\r\nmost dangerous, because there are such legions of them. To sum up, if\r\nyou wish to revel in colds, all that is necessary is to observe the\r\nfollowing few and simple rules:--\r\n\r\nKeep your windows shut.\r\n\r\nAvoid drafts as if they were a pestilence.\r\n\r\nTake no exercise between meals.\r\n\r\nBathe seldom, and in warm water.\r\n\r\nWear heavy flannels, chest-protectors, abdominal bandages, and electric\r\ninsoles.\r\n\r\nHave no heat in your bedroom.\r\n\r\nNever let anything keep you away from church, the theatre, or parties,\r\nin winter.\r\n\r\nNever go out-of-doors when it's windy, or rainy, or wet underfoot, or\r\ncold, or hot, or looks as if it was going to be any of these.\r\n\r\nBe just as intimate and affectionate as possible with every one you know\r\nwho has a cold. Don't neglect them on any account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nADENOIDS, OR MOUTH-BREATHING: THEIR CAUSE AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all ages it has been accounted a virtue to keep your mouth\r\nshut--chiefly, of course, upon moral or prudential grounds, for fear of\r\nwhat might issue from it if opened. Then came physiology to back up the\r\nmaxim, on the ground that the open mouth was also dangerous on account\r\nof what might be inhaled into it. Oddly enough, in this instance, both\r\nmorality and science have been beside the mark to the degree that they\r\nhave been mistaking a symptom for a cause. This has led us to absurd and\r\ninjurious extremes in both cases. On the moral and prudential side it\r\nhas led to such outrageous exaggerations as the well-known and\r\noft-quoted proverb, \"Speech is silver, but silence is golden.\"\r\nArticulate speech, the chiefest triumph and highest single\r\naccomplishment of the human species, the handmaid of thought and the\r\ninstrument of progress, is actually rated below silence, the attribute\r\nof the clod and of the dumb brute, the easy refuge of cowardice and of\r\nstupidity.\r\n\r\nEasily eight-tenths of all speech is informing, educative, helpful in\r\nsome modest degree; while fully that proportion of silence is due to\r\nlack of ideas, cowardice, or designs that can flourish only in darkness.\r\nIt is not the abundance of words, but the scarcity of ideas, that makes\r\nus flee from \"the plugless word-spout\" and avoid the chatterbox.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, upon the physical side, because children who breathe through\r\nthe mouth are apt to have a vacant expression, to be stupid and\r\ninattentive, undersized, pigeon-breasted, with short upper lip and\r\ncrowded teeth, we have leaped to the conclusion that it is a fearsome\r\nand dangerous thing to breathe through your mouth. All sorts of stories\r\nare told about the dangerousness of breathing frosty air directly into\r\nthe lungs. Invalids shut themselves scrupulously indoors for weeks and\r\neven months at a stretch, for fear of the terrible results of a \"blast\r\nof raw air\" striking into their bronchial tubes. All sorts of absurd\r\ninstruments of torture, in the form of \"respirators\" to tie over the\r\nmouth and nose and \"keep out the fog,\" are invented, and those who have\r\nthe slightest tendency to bronchial or lung disturbances are warned upon\r\npain of their life to wrap up their mouths whenever they go\r\nout-of-doors.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there is exceedingly little evidence to show that\r\npure, fresh, open air at any reasonable temperature and humidity ever\r\ndid harm when inhaled directly into the lungs. In fact, a considerable\r\nproportion of us, when swinging along at a lively gait on the country\r\nroads, or playing tennis or football, or engaged in any form of active\r\nsport, will be found to keep our lips parted and to inhale from a sixth\r\nto a third of our breath in this way, and with no injurious results\r\nwhatever. Nine-tenths of all the maladies believed to be due to\r\nbreathing even the coldest and rawest of air are now known to be due to\r\ninvading germs.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, mouth-breathing in all ages has been regarded as a bad\r\nhabit, and with good reason. It was only about thirty years ago that we\r\nbegan to find out why. A Danish throat surgeon, William Meyer, whose\r\ndeath occurred only a few months ago, discovered, in studying a number\r\nof children who were affected with mouth-breathing, that in all of them\r\nwere present in the roof of the throat curious spongy growths, which\r\nblocked up the posterior opening of the nostrils. As this mass was made\r\nup of a number of smaller lobules, and the tissue appeared to be like\r\nthat of a lymphatic gland, or \"kernel,\" the name \"adenoids\" (gland-like)\r\nwas given to them. Later they were termed _post-nasal growths_, from the\r\nfact that they lay just behind the rear opening of the nostrils; and\r\nthese two names are used interchangeably. Our knowledge has spread and\r\nbroadened from this starting-point, until we now know that adenoids are\r\nthe chief, yes, almost the sole primary cause, not merely of\r\nmouth-breathing, but of at least two-thirds of the injurious effects\r\nwhich have been attributed to this habit.\r\n\r\nMouth-breathing is not simply a bad habit, a careless trick on the part\r\nof the child. We have come to realize that physical bad habits, as well\r\nas many mental and moral ones, have a definite physical cause, and that\r\n_no child ever becomes a mouth-breather as long as he can breathe\r\ncomfortably through his nose_.\r\n\r\nThis clears the ground at once of a considerable amount of useless\r\nlumber in the shape of advice to train the child to keep his mouth shut.\r\nI have even known mothers who were in the habit of going around after\r\ntheir helpless offspring were asleep and gently but firmly pushing up\r\nthe little jaw and pressing the lips together until some sort of an\r\nattempt at respiration was made through the nostrils. Advertisements\r\nstill appear of sling-like apparatuses for holding the jaws closed\r\nduring sleep.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to stop mouth-breathing before providing abundant air-space\r\nthrough the nostrils is not only irrational, but cruel. Of course, after\r\nthe child has once become a mouth-breather, even after the nostrils have\r\nbeen made perfectly free, it will not at once abandon its habit of\r\nmonths or years, and disciplinary measures of some sort may then be\r\nneeded for a time. But the hundred-times-repeated admonition, \"For\r\nheaven's sake, child, shut your mouth! Don't go around with it hanging\r\nopen like that!\" unless preceded by proper treatment of the nostrils,\r\nwill have just about as much effect upon the habit as the proverbial\r\nwater on a duck's back. No use trying to close his mouth by any amount\r\nof opening of your own.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as does not always happen, with our discovery of the cause\r\nhas come the knowledge of the cure; and we are able to say with\r\nconfidence that, widespread and serious as are disturbances of health\r\nand growth associated with mouth-breathing, they can be absolutely\r\nprevented and abolished.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the cause of this nasal obstruction, and when does it\r\nbegin to operate? The primary cause is catarrhal inflammation, with\r\nswelling and thickening of the secretions, and it may begin to operate\r\nanywhere from the seventh month to the seventh year. A neglected\r\nattack, or series of attacks, of \"snuffles,\" colds in the head,\r\ncatarrhs, in infants and young children, will set up a slow inflammation\r\nof this glandular mass at the back of the nostrils--a tonsil, by the\r\nway--and start its enlargement.\r\n\r\nWhether we know anything about adenoids themselves or not, we are all\r\nfamiliar with their handiwork. The open mouth, giving a vacant\r\nexpression to the countenance, the short upper lip, the pinched and\r\ncontracted nostrils, the prominent and irregular teeth, the listless\r\nexpression of the eyes, the slow response to request or demand, we have\r\nseen a score of times in every schoolroom. Coupled with these facial\r\nfeatures are apt to be found on closer investigation a lack of interest\r\nin both work and play, an impaired appetite, restless sleep, and a\r\ncurious general backwardness of development, both bodily and mental, so\r\nthat the child may be from one to four inches below the normal height\r\nfor his years, from five to fifteen pounds under weight, and from one to\r\nthree grades behind his proper school position. Very often, also, his\r\nchest is inclined to be narrow, the tip of his breastbone to be sunken,\r\nand his abdomen larger in girth than his chest. Is it possible that the\r\nmere inhaling of air directly into the lungs, even though it be\r\nimperfectly warmed, moistened, and filtered, as compared with what it\r\nwould be if drawn through the elaborate \"steam-coils\" in the nostrils\r\nfor this purpose, can have produced this array of defects? It is\r\nincredible on the face of it and unfounded in fact. Fully two-thirds of\r\nthese can be traced to the direct influence of the adenoids.\r\n\r\nThese adenoids, it may briefly be stated, are the result of an\r\nenlargement of a _tonsil_, or group of small tonsils, identical in\r\nstructure with the well-known bodies of the same name which can be seen\r\non either side of the throat. They have the same unfortunate faculty as\r\nthe other tonsils for getting into hot water, flaring up, inflaming, and\r\nswelling on the slightest irritation. And, unfortunately, they are so\r\nsituated that their capacity for harm is far greater than that of the\r\nother tonsils. They seem painfully like the chip on the shoulder of a\r\nfighting man, ready to be knocked off at the lightest touch and plunge\r\nthe whole body into a scrimmage. Their position is a little difficult to\r\ndescribe to one not familiar with the anatomy of the throat, especially\r\nas they cannot be seen except with a laryngeal mirror; but it may be\r\nroughly stated as in the middle of the roof of the throat, just at the\r\nback of the nostrils, and above the soft palate. From this coign of\r\nvantage they are in position to produce serious disturbances of two of\r\nour most important functions,--respiration and digestion,--and three out\r\nof the five senses,--smell, taste, and hearing.\r\n\r\nWe will begin with their most frequent and most serious injurious\r\neffect, though not the earliest,--the impairment of the child's power of\r\nattention and intelligence. So well known is their effect in this\r\nrespect that there is scarcely an intelligent and progressive teacher\r\nnowadays who is not thoroughly posted on adenoids. Some of them will\r\nmake a snap diagnosis as promptly and almost as accurately as a\r\nphysician; and when once they suspect their presence, they will leave\r\nno stone unturned to secure an examination of the child by a competent\r\nphysician, and the removal of the growths, if present. They consider it\r\na waste of time to endeavor to teach a child weighted with this\r\nhandicap. How keenly awake they are to their importance is typified by\r\nthe remark of a prominent educator five or six years ago:--\r\n\r\n\"When I hear a teacher say that a child is stupid, my first instinctive\r\nconclusion is either that the child has adenoids, or that the teacher is\r\nincompetent.\"\r\n\r\nThe lion's share of their influence upon the child's intelligence is\r\nbrought about in a somewhat unexpected and even surprising manner, and\r\nthat is by the _effects of the growths upon his hearing_. You will\r\nrecall that this third tonsil was situated at the highest point in the\r\nroof of the pharynx, or back of the throat. The first effect of its\r\nenlargement is naturally to block the posterior opening of the nostrils.\r\nBut it has another most serious vantage-ground for harm in its peculiar\r\nposition. Only about three-fourths of an inch below it upon either side\r\nopen the mouths of the Eustachian tubes, the little funnels which carry\r\nair from the throat out into the drum-cavity of the ear. You have\r\nfrequently had practical demonstrations of their existence, by the\r\nwell-known sensation, when blowing your nose vigorously, of feeling\r\nsomething go \"pop\" in the ear. This sensation was simply due to a bubble\r\nof air being driven out through this tube from the back of the throat,\r\nunder pressure brought to bear in blowing the nose. The luckless\r\nposition of the third tonsil could hardly have been better planned if it\r\nhad been devised for the special purpose of setting up trouble in the\r\nmouths of these Eustachian tubes.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as the enlargements become chronic, they pour out a thick\r\nmucous secretion, which quickly becomes purulent, or, in the vernacular,\r\n\"matter.\" This trickles down on both sides of the throat, and drains\r\nright into the open mouth of the Eustachian tube. Not only so, but these\r\nEustachian tubes are the remains of the first gill-slits of embryonic\r\nlife, and, like all other gill-slits, have a little mass of this same\r\nlymphoid or tonsilar tissue surrounding them. This also becomes infected\r\nand inflamed, clogs the opening, and one fatal day the inflammation\r\nshoots out along the tube, and the child develops an attack of earache.\r\nAt least two-thirds of all cases of earache, and, indeed, five-sixths of\r\nall cases of deafness in children, are due to adenoids.\r\n\r\nEarache is simply the pain due to acute inflammation in the small\r\ndrum-cavity of the ear. This in the large majority of cases will subside\r\nand drain back again into the throat through the Eustachian tube. In a\r\nfair percentage of instances, however, it will break in the opposite\r\ndirection, and we have the familiar ruptured drum and discharge from the\r\near. In either case the drum becomes thickened, so that it can no longer\r\nvibrate properly; the delicate little chain of bones behind it, like the\r\nlevers of a piano, becomes clogged, and the child becomes deaf, whether\r\na chronic discharge be present or not.\r\n\r\nThis is the secret of his \"inattention,\" his \"indifference,\"--even of\r\nhis apparent disobedience and rebelliousness. What other children hear\r\nwithout an effort he has to strain every nerve to catch. He\r\nmisunderstands the question that is asked of him, makes an absurd\r\nanswer, and is either scolded or laughed at. It isn't long before he\r\nfalls into the attitude: \"Well, I can't get it right, anyhow, no matter\r\nhow I try, so I don't care.\" Up to five or ten years ago the puzzled and\r\ndistracted teacher would simply report the child for stupidity,\r\nindifference, and even insubordination. In nine cases out of ten, when\r\nchildren are naughty or stupid, they are really sick.\r\n\r\nNot content with dulling one of the child's senses, these thugs of the\r\nbody-politic proceed to throttle two others--smell and taste. Obviously\r\nthe only way of smelling anything is to sniff its odor into your nose.\r\nAnd if this be more or less, or completely, blocked up, and its delicate\r\nmucous membranes coated with a thick, ropy discharge, you will not be\r\nable to distinguish anything but the crudest and rankest of odors. But\r\nwhat has this to do with taste? Merely that two-thirds of what we term\r\n\"taste\" is really smell. Seal the nostrils and you can't \"tell chalk\r\nfrom cheese,\" not even a cube of apple from a cube of onion, as scores\r\nof experiments have shown. We all know how flat tea, coffee, and even\r\nour own favorite dishes taste when we have a bad cold, and this,\r\nremember, is the permanent condition of the palate of the poor little\r\nmouth-breather. No wonder his appetite is apt to be poor, and that even\r\nwhat food he eats will not produce a flow of \"appetite juice\" in the\r\nstomach, which Pavloff has shown to be so necessary to digestion. No\r\nwonder his digestion is apt to go wrong, ably assisted by the continual\r\ndrip of the chronic discharge down the back of his throat; his bowels to\r\nbecome clogged and his abdomen distended.\r\n\r\nBut the resources for mischief of this pharyngeal \"Old Man of the Sea\"\r\nare not even yet exhausted. Next comes a very curious and unexpected\r\none. We have all heard much of \"the struggle for existence\" among plants\r\nand animals, and have had painful demonstrations of its reality in our\r\nown personal experience. But we hardly suspected that it was going on in\r\nour own interior. Such, however, is the case; and when once one organ or\r\nstructure falls behind the others in the race of growth, its neighbors\r\npromptly begin to encroach upon and take advantage of it. Emerson was\r\nright when he said, \"I am the Cosmos,\" the universe.\r\n\r\nNow, the mouth and the nose were originally one cavity. As Huxley long\r\nago remarked, \"When Nature undertook to build the skull of a land animal\r\nshe was too lazy to start on new lines, and simply took the old\r\nfish-skull and made it over, for air-breathing purposes.\" And a clumsy\r\njob she made of it!\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked, in passing, that mouth-breathing, as a matter of\r\nhistory, is an exceedingly old and respectable habit, a reversion, in\r\nfact, to the method of breathing of the fish and the frog. \"To drink\r\nlike a fish\" is a shameful and utterly unfounded aspersion upon a\r\nblameless creature of most correct habits and model deportment. What the\r\npoor goldfish in the bowl is really doing with his continual \"gulp,\r\ngulp!\" is breathing--not drinking.\r\n\r\nThis remodeling starts at a very early period of our individual\r\nexistence. A horizontal ridge begins to grow out on either side of our\r\nmouth-nose cavity, just above the roots of the teeth. This thickens and\r\nwidens into a pair of shelves, which finally, about the third month of\r\nembryonic life, meet in the middle line to form the hard palate or roof\r\nof the mouth, which forms also the floor of the nose. Failure of the two\r\nshelves to meet properly causes the well-known \"cleft-palate,\" and, if\r\nthis failure extends forward to the jaw, \"hare-lip.\" In the growth of a\r\nhealthy child a balance is preserved between these lower and upper\r\ncompartments of the original mouth-nose cavity, and the nose above\r\ngrowing as rapidly in depth and in breadth as the mouth below, the\r\nhorizontal partition between--the floor of the nose and the roof of the\r\nmouth--is kept comparatively flat and level. In adenoids, however, the\r\nnostrils no longer being adequately used, and consequently failing to\r\ngrow, and the mouth cavity below growing at the full normal rate, it is\r\nnot long before the mouth begins to encroach upon the nostrils by\r\npushing up the partition of the palate. As soon as this upward bulge of\r\nthe roof of the mouth occurs, then there is a diminution of the\r\nresistance offered by the horizontal healthy palate to the continual\r\npressure of the muscles of the cheeks and of mastication upon the sides\r\nof the upper jaw, the more readily as the tongue has dropped down from\r\nits proper resting position up in the roof of the mouth. These are\r\npushed inward, the arch of the jaw and of the teeth is narrowed, the\r\nfront teeth are made to project, and, instead of erupting, with plenty\r\nof room, in even, regular lines, are crowded against and overlap one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhen from any cause the lower jaw habitually hangs down, as in the open\r\nmouth, it tends to be thrown slightly forward in its socket. Then, when\r\nthe jaws close again, the arches of the upper and lower teeth no longer\r\nmeet evenly. Instead of \"locking\" at almost every point, as they should,\r\nthey overlap, or fall behind, or inside, or outside, of each other. So\r\nthat instead of every tooth meeting its fellow of the jaw above evenly\r\nand firmly, they strike at an angle, slip past or even miss one another,\r\nand thus increase the already existing irregularity and overlapping.\r\nEach individual tooth, missing its best stimulus to healthy growth and\r\nvigor, firm and regular pressure and exercise against its fellow in the\r\njaw above or below, gets a twist in its socket, wears away irregularly,\r\nand becomes an easy prey to decay, while from failure of the entire\r\nupper and lower arches of the teeth to meet squarely and press evenly\r\nand firmly against one another, the jaws fail to expand properly and the\r\ntendency to narrowing of the tooth-arches and upward vaulting of the\r\npalate is increased.\r\n\r\nIn short, we are coming to the conclusion that from half to two-thirds\r\nof all cases of \"crowded mouth,\" irregular teeth, and high-arched palate\r\nin children are due to adenoids. Progressive dentists now are insisting\r\nupon their little patients, who come to them with these conditions,\r\nbeing examined for adenoids, and upon the removal of these, if found, as\r\na preliminary measure to mechanical corrective treatment. Cases are now\r\non record of children with two, three, or even four generations of\r\ncrowded teeth and narrow mouths behind them, but who, simply by being\r\nsharply watched for nasal obstruction and the symptoms of adenoids, by\r\nthe removal of these latter as soon as they have put in an appearance,\r\nhave grown up with even, regular, well-developed teeth and wide, healthy\r\nmouths and jaws. Unfortunately, attention to the adenoids will not\r\nremove these defects of the jaws and teeth after they have been\r\nproduced. But, if the child be under ten, or even twelve, years of age,\r\ntheir removal may yet do much permanently to improve the condition, and\r\nis certainly well worth while on general principles.\r\n\r\nTake care of the nose, and the jaws will take care of themselves. An\r\nounce of adenoids-removal in the young child is worth a pound of\r\n_orthodontia_--teeth-straightening--in the boy or girl; though both are\r\noften necessary.\r\n\r\nThe dull, dead tone of the voice in these children is, of course, an\r\nobvious effect of the blocked nostrils. Similarly, the broken sleep,\r\nwith dreams of suffocation and of \"Things Sitting on the Chest,\" are\r\nreadily explained by the desperate efforts that the little one makes to\r\nbreathe through clogging nostrils, in which the discharges, blown and\r\nsneezed out in the daytime, dry and accumulate during sleep, until,\r\nhalf-suffocated, it \"lets go\" and draws in huge gulps of air through the\r\nopen mouth. No child ever became a mouth-breather from choice, or until\r\nafter a prolonged struggle to continue breathing through its nose.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the question, What are these adenoids, and how do\r\nthey come to produce such serious disturbances? This can be partially\r\nanswered by saying that they are tonsils and with all a tonsil's\r\nsusceptibility to irritation and inflammation. But that only raises the\r\nfurther question, What is a tonsil? And to that no answer can be given\r\nbut Echo's. They are one of the conundrums of physiology. All we know of\r\nthem is that they are not true _glands_, as they have neither duct nor\r\nsecretion, but masses of simple embryonic tissue called _lymphoid_,\r\nwhich has a habit of grouping itself about the openings of disused\r\ncanals. This is what accounts for their position in the throat, as they\r\nhave no known useful function. The two largest, or throat-tonsils,\r\nsurround the inner openings of the second gill-slits of the embryo; the\r\nlingual tonsil, at the base of the tongue below, encircles the mouth of\r\nthe duct of the thyroid gland (the _goitre_ gland); and our own\r\nparticular Pandora's Box above, in the roof of the pharynx, is grouped\r\nabout the opening of another disused canal, which performs the singular\r\nand apparently most uncalled-for office of connecting the cavity of the\r\nbrain with the throat. They can all of them be removed completely\r\nwithout any injury to the general health, and they all tend to shrink\r\nand become smaller--in the case of the topmost, or pharyngeal, almost\r\ndisappear--after the twelfth or fourteenth year.\r\n\r\nNot only have they an abundant crop of troubles of their own, as most of\r\nus can testify from painful experience, but they serve as a port of\r\nentry for the germs of many serious diseases, such as tuberculosis,\r\nrheumatism, diphtheria, and possibly scarlet fever. They appear to be a\r\nstrange sort of survival or remnant,--not even suitable for the\r\nbargain-counter,--a hereditary leisure class in the modern democracy of\r\nthe body, a fertile soil for all sorts of trouble.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have this little bunch of idle tissue, about the size of\r\na small hazelnut, ready for any mischief which our Satan-bacilli may\r\nfind for its hands to do. A child kept in a badly ventilated room\r\ninhales into his nostrils irritating dust or gases, or, more commonly\r\nyet, the floating germs of some one or more of those dozen mild\r\ninfections which we term \"a common cold.\" Instantly irritation and\r\nswelling are set up in the exquisitely elastic tissues of the nostrils,\r\nthick, sticky mucous, instead of the normal watery secretion, is poured\r\nout, the child begins to sneeze and snuffle and \"run at the nose,\" and\r\neither the bacteria are carried directly to this danger sponge, right at\r\nthe back of the nostrils, or the inflammation gradually spreads to it.\r\nThe mucous membrane and tissues of the nose have an abundance of\r\nvitality,--like most hard workers,--and usually react, overwhelm, and\r\ndestroy the invading germs, and recover from the attack; but the useless\r\nand half-dead tissue of the pharyngeal tonsil has much less power of\r\nrecuperation, and it smoulders and inflames, though ultimately, perhaps,\r\nit may swing round to recovery. Often, however, a new cold will be\r\ncaught before this has fully occurred, and then another one a month or\r\nso later, until finally we get a chronically thickened, inflamed, and\r\nenlarged condition of this interesting, but troublesome, body. What its\r\ncapabilities are in this respect may be gathered from the fact that,\r\nwhile normally of the size of a small hazelnut, it is no uncommon thing\r\nto find a mass which absolutely blocks up the whole of the upper part of\r\nthe pharynx, and may vary from the size of a robin's egg to that of a\r\nlarge English walnut, or even a small hen's egg, according to the age of\r\nthe child and the size of the throat.\r\n\r\nDirt has been defined as \"matter out of place,\" and the pharyngeal\r\ntonsil is an excellent illustration. Nature is said never to make\r\nmistakes, but she is apt to be absent-minded at times, and we are\r\ntracing now not a few of the troubles that our flesh is heir to, to\r\nlittle oversights of hers--scraps of inflammable material left lying\r\nabout among the cogs of the body-machine, such as the appendix, the\r\ngall-bladder, the wisdom teeth, and the tonsils. One day a spark drops\r\non them, or they get too near a bearing or a \"hot-box,\" and, in a flash,\r\nthe whole machine is in a blaze.\r\n\r\nNever neglect snuffles or \"cold in the head\" in a young child, and\r\nparticularly in a baby. Have it treated at once antiseptically, by\r\ncompetent hands, and learn exactly what to do for it on the appearance\r\nof the earliest symptoms in the future, and you will not only save the\r\nlittle ones a great deal of temporary discomfort and distress,--for it\r\nis perfect torment to a child to breathe through its mouth at\r\nfirst,--but you will ward off many of the most serious troubles of\r\ninfancy and childhood. We can hardly expect to prevent all development\r\nof adenoids by these prompt and painless stitches in time, for some\r\nchildren seem to be born peculiarly subject to them, either from the\r\ninheritance of a particular shape of nose and throat,--\"the family\r\nnose,\" as it has been called,--or from some peculiar sponginess and\r\nliability to inflammation and enlargement of all these tonsilar or\r\nlymphoid \"glands\" and \"kernels\" of the body generally--the old\r\n\"lymphatic temperament.\"\r\n\r\nWe are, however, now coming to the opinion that this so-called\r\n\"hereditary\" narrow nose, short upper lip, and high-arched palate are,\r\nin a large percentage of cases, the _result of adenoids in infancy_ in\r\neach successive generation of parents and grandparents. At all events,\r\nthere are now on record cases of children whose parents, grandparents,\r\nand great-grandparents are known to have been mouth-breathers, and who\r\nhave on that account been sharply watched for the possible development\r\nof adenoids in early life, and these removed as soon as they appeared,\r\nand they have grown up with well-developed, wide nostrils, broad, flat\r\npalates, and regular teeth, overcoming \"hereditary defect\" in a single\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, their origin and ancestral relations may have an\r\nimportant practical bearing, even in the twentieth century. At the upper\r\nend of this curious _throat-brain_ canal lies another mass, the\r\nso-called _pituitary body_. This has been found to exert a profound\r\ninfluence over development and growth. Its enlargement is attended by\r\ngiantism and another curious giant disease in which the hands, feet, and\r\njaws enlarge enormously, known as _acromegaly_. It also pours into the\r\nblood a secretion which has a powerful effect upon both the circulation\r\nand the respiration. It is found shrunken and wasted in dwarfs. Some\r\nyears ago it was suggested by my distinguished friend, the late Dr.\r\nHarrison Allen, and myself, that some of the extraordinary dwarfing and\r\ngrowth-retarding effects of adenoids might be due to a reflex influence\r\nexerted on their old colleague, the pituitary body. This view has found\r\nits way into several of the textbooks. Blood is thicker than water, and\r\nold ancestral vibrations will sometimes be set up in most unexpected\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nNow comes the cheerful side of the picture. I should have hesitated to\r\ndraw at such full length and in such lugubrious detail the direful\r\npossibilities and injurious effects of adenoids if its only result could\r\nhave been to arouse apprehensions which could not be relieved.\r\n\r\nFortunately, just the reverse is the case, and there are few conditions\r\naffecting the child, so common and such a fertile source of all kinds of\r\nmischief, and at the same time so completely curable, and whose cure\r\nwill be attended by such gratifying improvement on the part of the\r\nlittle sufferer. In the first place, as has been said, their formation\r\nmay usually be prevented altogether by intelligent and up-to-date\r\nhygienic care of the nose and the throat. In the second place, even\r\nafter they have occurred and developed to a considerable degree, they\r\ncan be removed by a trifling and almost painless operation, and, if\r\ntaken early enough, all their injurious effects overcome. If, however,\r\nthey have been neglected too long, so that the child has passed the\r\neighth or ninth year before any interference has been attempted, and\r\nstill more, of course, if it has passed the twelfth or thirteenth year,\r\nthen only a part of the disturbances that have been caused can be\r\nremedied by their removal. So soft and pulpy are these growths, so\r\npoorly supplied with blood-vessels or nerves, and so slightly connected\r\nwith the healthy tissues below them, that they may, in skilled hands, be\r\ncompletely removed by simply scraping with a dull surgical spoon\r\n(curette) or curved forceps, but never anything more knife-like than\r\nthis. In fact, in the first seven years of life, when their removal is\r\nboth easiest and will do most good, it is hardly proper to dignify the\r\nprocedure by the name of an operation. It is attended by about the same\r\ndegree of risk and of hemorrhage as the extraction of a tooth, and by\r\nless than half the amount of pain.\r\n\r\nBut, trifling and free from danger as is the operation, there is nothing\r\nin the entire realm of surgery which is followed by more brilliant and\r\ngratifying results. It seems almost incredible until one has seen it in\r\nhalf a dozen successive cases. Not merely doctors, but teachers and\r\nnurses, develop a positive enthusiasm for it. This was the operation\r\nthat led to the comical, but pathetic, \"Mothers' Riots\" in the New York\r\nschools. The word went forth, \"The Krishts are cutting the throats of\r\nyour children\"; and, with the shameful echoes of Kishineff ringing in\r\ntheir ears, the Yiddish mothers swarmed forth to battle for the lives of\r\ntheir offspring.\r\n\r\nIt is no uncommon thing to have a child of seven jump three to five\r\ninches in height, six to twelve pounds in weight, and one to three\r\ngrades in his schooling, within the year following the operation. Ten\r\nyears more of intelligence and hygienic teaching should see this scourge\r\nof childhood completely wiped out, or at least robbed of its\r\npossibilities for harm. When this is done, at least two-thirds of all\r\ncases of deafness, more than half of all cases of arrested development,\r\nand three-fourths of those of backwardness in children will disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS, A SCOTCHED SNAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne of the darling habits of humanity is to discover that we are facing\r\na crisis. One could safely offer a large prize for a group of ten\r\ncommencement orations, or political platforms, at least a third of which\r\ndid not announce this momentous fact. Either we are facing it or it\r\nconfronts us, and unutterable things will happen unless we \"gird up our\r\nloins,\" and vote the right ticket. An interesting feature about these\r\nloudly heralded crises is that they hardly ever \"crise.\" The real crisis\r\neither strikes us so hard that we never know what hit us, or is over\r\nbefore we recognize that anything was going to happen. And most of our\r\nreflections about it are after ones--trying to explain what caused it.\r\nIn fact, in public affairs, as in medicine, a crisis is a sign of\r\nrecovery. Its occurrence is an indication that nature is preparing to\r\nthrow off the disease. Nowhere is this truth more vividly illustrated\r\nthan in the tuberculosis situation. When, about thirty years ago, the\r\nworld began to awake from its stupor of centuries, and to realize that\r\nthis one great disease alone was _killing one-seventh of all people born\r\nunder civilization_, and crippling as many more; that its killed and\r\nwounded every year cast in the shade the bloodiest wars ever waged, and\r\nthat it was apparently caused by the civilization which it ravaged,--no\r\nwonder that we were appalled at the outlook.\r\n\r\nHere was a disease of civilization, caused by the conditions of that\r\ncivilization. Could it be cured without destroying its cause and\r\nreverting to barbarism? Yet this very apprehension was a sign of hope, a\r\npromise of improvement. That we were able to feel it was a sign that we\r\nwere shaking off the old fatalistic attitude toward disease,--as\r\ninevitable or an act of Providence. It was brought about by the more\r\naccurate and systematic study of disease. We had long been sadly\r\nfamiliar with the fact that death by consumption, by \"slow decline,\" by\r\n\"wasting\" or \"slow fever,\" was frightfully common. \"To fall into a\r\ndecline\" and die was one of the standard commonplaces of romantic\r\nliterature. But that was quite different from knowing in cold, hard\r\nfigures and inescapable percentages exactly how many of the race were\r\nkilled by it. It is one of the striking illustrations of the advantages\r\nof good bookkeeping. Boards and departments of health had just fairly\r\ngot on their feet and started an accurate system of state accounts in\r\nmatters of deaths and births. We were beginning to recognize national\r\nhealth as an asset, and to scrutinize its fluctuations with keen\r\ninterest accordingly.\r\n\r\nWe may decry statistics as much as we like, but when we see the effects\r\nof a disease set down in cold columns of black and white we have no\r\nlonger any idea of submitting to it as inevitable. We are going to get\r\nright up and do some fighting. \"One-seventh of all the deaths\" has\r\nliterally become the war cry of our new Holy War against tuberculosis.\r\nStill another stirring phrase of inestimable value in rousing us from\r\nour torpor was that coined by the brilliant and lovable\r\nphysician-philosopher, Oliver Wendell Holmes: \"The Great White Plague of\r\nthe North.\" This vivid epithet, abused as it may have been in later\r\nyears, was of enormous service in fixing the public mind on consumption\r\nas a definite, individual disease, something to be fought and guarded\r\nagainst. Before that, we had been inclined to look upon it as just a\r\nnatural failing of the vital forces, a thing that came from within, and\r\nwas in no sense caused from without. The fair young girl, or the\r\ndelicate boy whose vitality was hardly sufficient to carry him through\r\nthe stern battle of life, under some slight shock, or even mental\r\ndisappointment, would sink into a decline, gradually waste away, and\r\ndie. What could be done in such a case, except to bow in submission to\r\nthe inscrutable ways of Providence?\r\n\r\nIt seems incredible now, but such was the light in which smallpox was\r\nregarded by physicians of the Arabian and mediæval schools: a natural\r\noozing forth of \"peccant humors\" in the blood of the young, a\r\ndisagreeable, but perfectly natural, and even necessary, process. For if\r\nthe patient did not get rid of these humors either he would die or his\r\ngrowth would be seriously impaired. Now smallpox has become little more\r\nthan a memory in civilization, and consumption is due to follow its\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nSanitary pioneers had already begun casting about eagerly for light upon\r\nthe influence of housing, of drainage, of food, in the causation of\r\ntuberculosis, when a new and powerful weapon was suddenly placed in\r\ntheir hands by the infant science of bacteriology. This was the now\r\nworld-famous discovery by Robert Koch that consumption and other forms\r\nof tuberculosis were due to the attack of a definite bacillus. No\r\ntubercle bacillus--no consumption.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this discovery appeared to be anything but encouraging.\r\nIn fact, it seemed to make the situation and the outlook even more\r\nhopeless. And when within a few years it was further demonstrated in\r\nrapid succession that most of the diseases of the spine in children, of\r\nthe group of symptoms associated with enlarged glands or kernels in the\r\nneck and known as \"scrofula\" or struma, most cases of hip-joint disease,\r\nof white swelling of the knee, a large percentage of chronic ulcerations\r\nof the skin known as _lupus_, a common form of fatal bowel disease in\r\nchildren, and many instances of peritonitis in adults, together with\r\nfully half of the fatal cases of convulsions in children, were due to\r\nthe activity of this same ubiquitous bacillus, it looked as if the enemy\r\nwere hopelessly entrenched against attack. And when it was further found\r\nthat a similar bacillus was almost as common a cause of death and\r\ndisease in cattle, particularly dairy cattle, and another in domestic\r\nfowls, it looked as if the heavens above and the earth beneath were so\r\nthickly strewn and so hopelessly infested with the germs that to war\r\nagainst them, or hope to escape from them, was like fighting back the\r\nAtlantic tides with a broom.\r\n\r\nBut this chill of discouragement quickly passed. Our foe had come down\r\nout of the clouds, and was spread out in battle array before us, in\r\nplain sight on the level earth. We were ready for the conflict, and\r\nproposed to \"fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\" It was\r\nnot long before we began to see joints in the enemy's armor and\r\nweaknesses in his positions. Then, when we lowered our field-glasses and\r\nturned to count our forces and prepare for the defense, we discovered\r\nwith a shock of delighted relief that whole regiments of unexpected\r\nreinforcements had come up while we were studying the enemy's position.\r\nThese new allies of ours were three of the great, silent forces of\r\nnature, which had fallen into line on either side and behind us, without\r\nhurry and without excitement, without even a bugle-blast to announce\r\ntheir coming.\r\n\r\nThe first was the great resisting power and vigor of the human organism,\r\nwhich we had gravely underestimated. The second, that power of\r\nadaptation to new circumstances, including even the attack of infectious\r\ndiseases, which we call \"survival of the fittest.\" The third, that\r\ngreat, sustaining, conservative power of nature--heredity. More cheering\r\nyet, these forces came, not merely fully armed, but bearing new weapons\r\nfitted for our hands. The vigor and unconquerable toughness of the human\r\nanimal presented us with three glittering weapons, sunshine, food, and\r\nfresh air.\r\n\r\n\"If the deadly bacillus breaks through the lines, put me in the gap!\r\nWith these weapons, with this triad, I will engage to hurl him back,\r\nshattered and broken.\" \"Equip your vanguard with them, and the enemy\r\nwill never break the line.\"\r\n\r\nThe survival of the fittest held out to us two weapons of strange and\r\ncurious make, one of them labeled \"immunity,\" the other \"quarantine.\"\r\n\"Give me a little time,\" she said, \"and with the first of these I will\r\nmake seven-tenths of the soldiers in your army proof against the spears\r\nof the enemy, as Achilles was when dipped in the Styx. With the other,\r\nsurround and isolate every roving band of the enemy that you can find;\r\ndrive him out of the holes and caves in which he lives, into the\r\nsunlight. Hold him in the open for forty-eight hours, and he will die of\r\nlight-stroke and starvation. Divide and conquer!\"\r\n\r\nThese reinforcements of ours have proved no mere figure of speech. They\r\nhave won many a battle for us already upon the tented field. They have\r\nnot merely made good their promises, but gone beyond them, and we are\r\nonly just beginning to appreciate their true worth, and how absolutely\r\nwe can rely upon them.\r\n\r\nThe first outpost of the enemy was captured with the sunshine-food-air\r\nweapons, and a glorious victory it was,--great in itself, and even more\r\nimportant for its moral effect and its encouragement for the future. To\r\npronounce an illness \"consumption\" had been from time immemorial\r\nequivalent to signing a death-warrant. Even the doctors could hardly\r\nbelieve it, when the first open-air enthusiasts began to claim that they\r\nhad actually cured cases of genuine consumption. For long there was a\r\ntendency to mutter in the beard, \"Well, it wasn't _genuine_ consumption,\r\nor it wouldn't have got better.\"\r\n\r\nBut after a period of incredulity this gave way to delighted confidence.\r\nThe open-air method would cure, and _did_ cure, and the patients\r\nremained cured for years afterward. Our first claims were barely for\r\ntwenty-five or thirty per cent of the threatened victims. Then we were\r\nable to increase it to fifty per cent; sixty, seventy, and finally\r\neighty were successively reached. But with the increase of our power\r\nover the cure of this disease came a realization of our knowledge of its\r\nlimitations. It quickly proved itself to be no sovereign and universal\r\npanacea, which would cure all cases, however desperate, or however\r\nindiscriminately it was applied. And emphatically it had to be mixed\r\nwith brains, on the part both of the physician and of the patient.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the likelihood of a cure depended, with almost\r\nmathematical certainty, upon the earliness of the stage at which it was\r\nbegun. Eight or ten years ago the outlook crystallized itself into the\r\nform which it has practically retained since: of cases put under\r\ntreatment in the very early stage, from seventy to ninety per cent were\r\npractical cures; of ordinary so-called \"first-stage\" cases, sixty to\r\nseventy per cent; second-stage cases, or those in whom the disease was\r\nwell developed, thirty to sixty per cent; and well-advanced cases,\r\nfifteen to thirty per cent of apparent cures. _The crux of the whole\r\nproposition lies in the early recognition of the disease by the\r\nphysician_, and the prompt acceptance of the diagnosis by the patient,\r\nand his willingness to drop everything and fight intelligently and\r\nvigorously for his life. Physicians are now thoroughly awake on this\r\npoint, and are concentrating their most careful attention and study upon\r\nmethods of recognition at the earliest possible stages. At the same time\r\nthose magnificent associations for the study and prevention of\r\ntuberculosis, international, national, state, and local,--the greatest\r\nof which, the International Tuberculosis Congress, has just honored\r\nAmerica, by meeting in Washington,--are straining every nerve to educate\r\nthe public to understand the importance of recognizing the earliest\r\npossible symptoms of this disease, no matter how trivial they may\r\nappear, and making every other consideration bend to the fight.\r\n\r\nThis new Word of Power, the open-air treatment, alone has transformed\r\none of the most hopeless, most pathetic, and painful fields of disease\r\ninto one of the most cheerful and hopeful. The vantage-ground won is\r\nsomething enormous. No longer need the family physician hang back, in\r\ndread and horror, from allowing himself even to recognize that the slow\r\nloss of weight, the increasing weakness, the flushed evening cheek, and\r\nthe restless sleep, are signs of this dread malady. Instead of shrinking\r\nfrom pronouncing the patient's doom, he knows now that he has everything\r\nto gain and nothing to lose by promptly warning him of his danger, even\r\nwhile it is still problematical. On the other hand, the patient need no\r\nlonger recoil in horror when told that he has consumption, and either go\r\nhome to set his house in order and make his will, or hunt up another\r\nmedical adviser who will take a more cheerful view of his case. All that\r\nhe has to do is to turn and fight the disease vigorously, intelligently,\r\npersistently, with the certain knowledge that the chances are five to\r\none in his favor; and that's a good fighting chance for any one.\r\n\r\nEven should there be reasonable ground for doubt as to the positive\r\nnature of the disease, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain by\r\ntaking the steps required to cure it. There is nothing magical or\r\nirrational, least of all injurious, in any way about them. Simply rest,\r\nabundant feeding, and plenty of fresh air. Even if the bacillus has not\r\nyet lodged in his tissues, this treatment will relieve the conditions of\r\ndepression from which he is suffering, and which would sooner or later\r\nrender him a favorable lodging-place for this omnipresent, tiny enemy.\r\n\r\nIf he has the disease the treatment will cure it. If he hasn't got it,\r\nit will prevent it; and the gain in vigor, weight, and general\r\nefficiency will more than pay him for the time lost from his business or\r\nhis study. It always pays to take time to put yourself back into a\r\ncondition of good health and highest efficiency.\r\n\r\nIt was early recognized that the campaign could not be won with this\r\nweapon alone. Inexpressibly valuable and cheering as it was, it had\r\nobvious limitations. The first of these was the obvious reflection that\r\nit was idle to cure even eighty per cent of all who actually developed\r\ntuberculosis, unless something were done to stop the disease from\r\ndeveloping at all. \"Eighty per cent of cures,\" of course, sounds very\r\nencouraging, especially by contrast with the almost unbroken succession\r\nof deaths before. But even a twenty per cent mortality from such a\r\ncommon disease, if it were to proceed unchecked, would make enormous\r\ninroads every year upon our national vigor.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it was quickly seen that those who recovered from the disease\r\nstill bore the scars; that while they might recover a fair degree of\r\nhealth and vigor, yet they were always handicapped by the time lost and\r\nthe damage inflicted by this slow and obstinate malady; that many of\r\nthem, while able to preserve good health under ideal conditions, were\r\nmarkedly and often distressingly limited in the range of their business\r\nactivities for years after, and even for life. Finally, that as these\r\ncases were followed further and further, it was found that even after\r\nbecoming cured they were sadly liable to relapse under some unexpected\r\nstrain, or to slacken their vigilance and drop back into their former\r\nbad physical habits; while the conviction began to grow steadily upon\r\nmen who had devoted one, two, or more decades to the study of this\r\ndisease in the localities most resorted to for its cure, that the\r\ngeneral vigor and vitality of these cured consumptives were apt to be\r\nnot of the best; that their duration of life was not equal to the\r\naverage; and that, even if they escaped a return of the disease, they\r\nwere apt to go down before their normal time under the attack of some\r\nother malady. In short, _cure_ was a poor weapon against the disease as\r\ncompared with _prevention_.\r\n\r\nBut before this, a careful study of the enemy's position and\r\ninvestigation of our own resources had brought another most important\r\nand reassuring fact to light, and that is, that while a distressingly\r\nlarge number of persons died of tuberculosis, these represented only a\r\ncomparatively small percentage of all who had actually been attacked by\r\nthe disease. One of the reasons why consumption had come to be regarded\r\nas such a deadly disease was that the milder cases of it were never\r\nrecognized. It was, and is yet, a common phrase in the mouths of both\r\nthe laity and of the medical profession: \"He was seriously threatened\r\nwith consumption\"; \"She came very near falling into a decline,\"--_but_\r\nthey recovered. If they didn't die of it, it wasn't \"real\" tuberculosis.\r\nNow we have changed all that, and have even begun to go to the opposite\r\nextreme, of declaring with the German experts, \"_Jeder Mann ist am ende\r\nein bischen tuberkulöse_.\" (Every one is some time or another a little\r\nbit tuberculous.) This sounds appalling at first hearing, but as a\r\nmatter of fact it is immensely encouraging. Our first suspicion of it\r\ncame from the records of that gruesome, but pricelessly valuable,\r\ntreasure-house of solid facts in pathology--the post-mortem room, the\r\ndead-house. Systematic examinations of all the bodies brought to autopsy\r\nin our great hospitals and elsewhere revealed at first thirty, then, as\r\nthe investigation became more minute and skillful, forty, sixty,\r\nseventy-five per cent of scars in the apices of the lungs, remains of\r\nhealed cavities, infected glands, or other signs of an invasion by the\r\ntubercle bacillus. Of course, the skeptic challenged very properly at\r\nonce:--\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know that these masses of chalky-material, these\r\nenlarged glands, are the result of tuberculosis? They may be due to some\r\nhalf-dozen other infections.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost before the question was asked a test was made by the troublesome\r\nbut convincing method of cutting open these scars, dividing these\r\nenlarged glands, scraping materials out of their centre, and injecting\r\nthem into guinea pigs. Result: from thirty to seventy per cent of the\r\nguinea pigs died of tuberculosis. In other cases it was not necessary to\r\ninoculate, as scrapings or sections from these scar-masses showed\r\ntubercle bacilli, clearly recognizable by their staining reaction.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have indisputable evidence of the fact that the tubercle\r\nbacillus may not only enter some of the openings of the body,--the\r\nnostrils, the mouth, the lungs,--but may actually form a lodgment and a\r\ngrowth-colony in the lungs themselves, and yet be completely defeated by\r\nthe antitoxic powers of the blood and other tissues of the body,\r\nprevented from spreading throughout the rest of the lung, most of the\r\ninvaders destroyed, and the crippled remnants imprisoned for life in the\r\ninterior of a fibroid or chalky mass.\r\n\r\nIt gave one a distinct shock at the meeting of the British Medical\r\nAssociation devoted to tuberculosis, some ten years ago, to hear Sir\r\nClifford Allbutt, one of the most brilliant and eminent physicians of\r\nthe English-speaking world, remark, on opening his address, \"Probably\r\nmost of us here have had tuberculosis and recovered from it.\"\r\n\r\nHere is evidently an asset of greatest and most practical value, which\r\nchanges half the face of the field. Instead of saving, as best we may,\r\nfrom half to two-thirds of those who have allowed the disease to get the\r\nupper hand and begin to overrun their entire systems, it places before\r\nus the far more cheering task of building up and increasing this natural\r\nresisting power of the human body, until not merely seventy per cent of\r\nall who are attacked by it will throw it off, but eighty, eighty-five,\r\nninety! We can plan to stop _consumption by preventing the consumptive_.\r\nA very small additional percentage of vigor or of resisting power--such\r\nas could be produced by but a slight improvement in the abundance of the\r\nfood-supply, the lighting and ventilating of the houses, the length and\r\n\"fatiguingness\" of the daily toil--might be the straw which would be\r\nsufficient to turn the scale and prevent the tuberculous individual from\r\nbecoming consumptive.\r\n\r\nHere comes in one of the most important and valuable features of our\r\nsplendid sanatorium campaign for the cure of tuberculosis, and that is\r\nthe nature of the methods employed. If we relied for the cure of the\r\ndisease upon some drug, or antitoxin, even though we might save as many\r\nlives, the general reflex or secondary effect upon the community might\r\nnot be in any way beneficial; at best it would probably be only\r\nnegative. But when the only \"drugs\" that we use are fresh air, sunshine,\r\nand abundant food, and the only antitoxins those which are bred in the\r\npatient's own body; when, in fact, we are using for the cure of\r\nconsumption _precisely those agencies and influences which will prevent\r\nthe well from ever contracting it_, then the whole curative side of the\r\nmovement becomes of enormous racial value. The very same measures that\r\nwe rely upon for the cure of the sick are those which we would recommend\r\nto the well, in order to make them stronger, happier, and more vigorous.\r\n\r\nIf the whole civilized community could be placed upon a moderate form of\r\nthe open-air treatment, it would be so vastly improved in health,\r\nvigor, and efficiency, and saved the expenditure of such enormous sums\r\nupon hospitals, poor relief, and sick benefits, that it would be well\r\nworth all that it would cost, even if there were no such disease as\r\ntuberculosis on earth.\r\n\r\nThis is coming to be the real goal, the ultimate hope of the far-sighted\r\nleaders in our tuberculosis campaign,--to use the cure of consumption as\r\na lever to raise to a higher plane the health, vigor, and happiness of\r\nthe entire community.\r\n\r\nEnormously valuable as is the open-air sanatorium as a means of saving\r\nthousands of valuable and beloved lives, its richest promise lies in its\r\nfunction as a school of education for the living demonstration of\r\nmethods by which the health and happiness of the ninety-five per cent of\r\nthe community who never will come within its walls may be built up.\r\nEvery consumptive cured in it goes home to be a living example and an\r\nenthusiastic missionary in the fresh-air campaign. The ultimate aim of\r\nthe sanatorium will be to turn every farmhouse, every village, every\r\ncity, into an open-air resort. When it shall have done this it will have\r\nfulfilled its mission.\r\n\r\nOur plan of campaign is growing broader and more ambitious, but more\r\nhopeful, every day. All we have to do is to keep on fighting and use our\r\nbrains, and victory is certain. Our Teutonic fellow soldiers have\r\nalready nailed their flag to the mast with the inscription:--\r\n\r\n\"No more tuberculosis after 1930!\"\r\n\r\nSo much for the serried masses of the centre of our anti-tuberculosis\r\narmy, upon which we depend for the heavy, mass fighting and the great\r\nfrontal attacks. But what of the right and the left wings, and the cloud\r\nof skirmishers and cavalry which is continually feeling the enemy's\r\nposition and cutting off his outposts? Upon the right stretch the\r\nintrenchments of the bacteriologic brigade, with the complicated but\r\nmarvelously effective weapons of precision given us by the discovery of\r\nthe definite and living cause of the disease, the _Bacillus\r\ntuberculosis_. Upon the left wing lie camp after camp of native\r\nregiments, whose loyalty until of very recent years was more than\r\ndoubtful,--heredity, acquired immunity, and the so-called improvements\r\nof modern civilization, steam, electricity, and their kinsmen.\r\n\r\nTo the artillerymen of the bacteriologic batteries appears to have been\r\nintrusted the most hopeless task, the forlorn hope,--the total\r\nextermination of a foe so tiny that he had to be magnified five hundred\r\ntimes before he was even visible, and of such countless myriads that he\r\nwas at least a billion times as numerous as the human race. But here\r\nagain, as in the centre of the battle-line, when we once made up our\r\nminds to fight, we were not long in discovering points of attack and\r\nweapons to assault him with.\r\n\r\nFirst, and most fundamental of all, came the consoling discovery that\r\nthough there could be no consumption without the bacillus, not more than\r\none individual in seven, of fair or average health, who was exposed to\r\nits attack in the form of a definite infection, succumbed to it; and\r\nthat, as strongly suggested by the post-mortem findings already\r\ndescribed, even those who developed a serious or fatal form of the\r\ndisease had thrown off from five to fifteen previous milder or slighter\r\ninfections. So that, to put it roughly, all that would be necessary\r\npractically to neutralize the injuriousness of the bacillus would be to\r\nprevent about one-twentieth of the exposures to its invasion which\r\nactually occurred. The other nineteen-twentieths would take care of\r\nthemselves. The bacilli are not the only ones who can be numbered in\r\ntheir billions. If there are billions of them there are billions of us.\r\nWe are not mere units--scarcely even individuals--except in a broad and\r\nfigurative sense. We are confederacies of billions upon billions of\r\nlittle, living animalcules which we call cells. These cells of ours are\r\nno Sunday-school class. They are old and tough and cunning to a degree.\r\nThey are war-worn veterans, carrying the scars of a score of victories\r\nwritten all over them. _They_ are animals; bacteria, bacilli,\r\nmicrococci, and all _their_ tribe are _vegetables_. The daily business,\r\nthe regular means of livelihood of the animal cell for fifteen millions\r\nof years past has been eating and digesting the vegetable. And all that\r\nour body-cells need is a little intelligent encouragement to continue\r\nthis performance, even upon disease germs; so that we needn't be afraid\r\nof being stampeded by sudden attack.\r\n\r\nThe next cheering find was that the worst enemies of the bacillus were\r\nour best friends. Sunlight will kill them just as certainly as it will\r\ngive us new life. The germs of tuberculosis will live for weeks and even\r\nmonths in dark, damp, unventilated quarters, just precisely such\r\nsurroundings as are provided for them in the inside bedrooms of our\r\ntenements, and the dark, cellar-like rooms of many a peasant's cottage\r\nor farmhouse. In bright sunlight they will perish in from three to six\r\nhours; in bright daylight in less than half a day. This is one of the\r\nfactors that helps to explain the apparent paradox, that the dust\r\ncollected from the floors and walls of tents and cottages in which\r\nconsumptives were treated was almost entirely free from tuberculous\r\nbacilli, while dust taken from the walls of tenement houses, the floors\r\nof street-cars, the walls of churches and theatres in New York City, was\r\nfound to be simply alive with them. One of the most important elements\r\nin the value of sunlight in the treatment of consumption is its powerful\r\ngermicidal effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS, A SCOTCHED SNAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the discovery that sunlight and fresh air are fatal to\r\nthe microörganisms of tuberculosis came the consoling fact that these\r\nbacilli, though most horribly ubiquitous and apparently infesting both\r\nthe heavens above and the earth beneath, had neither wings nor legs, and\r\nwere absolutely incapable of propelling themselves a fraction of an\r\ninch. They do not move--_they have to be carried_. More than this, like\r\nall other disease-germs, while incredibly tiny and infinitesimal, they\r\nhave a definite weight of their own, and are subject to the law of\r\ngravity. They do not flit about hither and thither in the atmosphere,\r\nthistledown fashion, but rapidly fall to the floor of whatever room or\r\nreceptacle they may be thrown in. And the problem of their transference\r\nis not that of direct carrying from one victim to the next, but the\r\nintermediate one of infected materials, such as are usually associated\r\nwith visible dust or dirt. In short, keep dust or dirt from the floor,\r\nout of our food, away from our fingers or clothing or anything that can\r\nbe brought to or near the mouth, and you will practically have abolished\r\nthe possibility of the transference of tuberculosis. The consumptive\r\nhimself is not a direct source of danger. It is only his filthy or\r\nunsanitary surroundings. Put a consumptive, who is careful of his sputum\r\nand cleanly in his habits, in a well-lighted, well-ventilated room, or,\r\nbetter still, out of doors, and there will be exceedingly little danger\r\nof any other member of his family or of those in the house with him\r\ncontracting the disease. Wherever there is dirt or dust there is danger,\r\nand there almost only. Thorough and effective house-reform--not merely\r\nin tenements, alas! but in myriads of private houses as well--would\r\nabolish two-thirds of the spread of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to isolate every consumptive in order to stop the\r\nspread of the disease. All that is requisite is to prevent the bacilli\r\nin his sputum from reaching the floor or the walls, to have both the\r\nlatter well lighted and aired, and, if possible, exposed to direct\r\nsunlight at some time during the day, and to see that dust from the\r\nfloor is not raised in clouds by dry sweeping so as to be inhaled into\r\nthe lungs or settle upon food, fingers, or clothing, and that children\r\nbe not allowed to play upon such floors as may be even possibly\r\ncontaminated. These precautions, combined with the five-to-one resisting\r\npower of the healthy human organism, will render the risk of\r\ntransmission of the disease an exceedingly small one. To what\r\ninfinitesimal proportions this risk can be reduced by intelligent and\r\nstrict sanitation is illustrated by the fact, already alluded to, of the\r\nalmost complete germ-freeness of the dust from walls and floors of\r\nsanitorium cottages, and by the even more convincing and conclusive\r\npractical result, that scarcely a single case is on record of the\r\ntransmission of this disease to a nurse, a physician, or a servant, or\r\nother employee in an institution for its cure.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no rational basis for this panic-stricken dread of\r\nan intelligent, cleanly consumptive, or for the cruel tendency to make\r\nhim an outcast and raise the cry of the leper against him: \"Unclean!\r\nUnclean!\"\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that consumption is transmitted _by\r\nway of the floor_; and if this relay-station be kept sterile there is\r\nlittle danger of its transmission by other means.\r\n\r\nPractically all that is needed to break this link is the absolute\r\nsuppression of what is universally and overwhelmingly regarded as not\r\nmerely an unsanitary and indecent, but a filthy, vulgar, and disgusting\r\nhabit--promiscuous expectoration. There is nothing new or unnatural in\r\nthis repression, this _tabu_ on expectoration. In fact, we are already\r\nprovided with an instinct to back it. In every race, in every age, in\r\nevery grade of civilization, the human saliva has been regarded as the\r\nmost disgusting, the most dangerous and repulsive of substances, and the\r\nact of spitting as the last and deepest sign of contempt and hatred; and\r\nif directed toward an individual, the deadliest and most unbearable\r\ninsult, which can be wiped out only by blood. Primitive literature and\r\nlegend are full of stories of the poisonousness of human saliva and the\r\ndeadliness of the human bite. It was the \"bugs\" in it that did it. It is\r\nmost interesting to see how science has finally, thousands of years\r\nafterward, shown the substantial basis of, and gone far to justify, this\r\ninstinctive horror and loathing.\r\n\r\nNot merely are the fluids of the human mouth liable to contain the\r\ntubercle bacillus, and that of diphtheria, of pneumonia, and half a\r\ndozen other definite disorders, but they are in perfectly healthy\r\nindividuals, especially where the teeth are in poor condition, simply\r\nswarming with millions of bacteria of every sort, some of them harmless,\r\nothers capable of setting up various forms of suppuration and septic\r\ninflammation if introduced into a wound, or even if taken into the\r\nstomach. Even if there were no such disease as tuberculosis a campaign\r\nto stamp out promiscuous expectoration would be well worth all it cost.\r\n\r\nOf course, as a counsel of perfection, the ideal procedure would be\r\npromptly to remove each consumptive, as soon as discovered, from his\r\nhouse and place him in a public sanatorium, provided by the state, for\r\nthe sake of removing him from the conditions which have produced his\r\ndisease, of placing him under those conditions which alone can offer a\r\nhopeful prospect of cure, and of preventing the further infection of his\r\nsurroundings. The only valid objections to such a plan are those of the\r\nexpense, which, of course, would be very great. It would be not merely\r\nbest, but kindest, for the consumptive himself, for his immediate\r\nfamily, and for the community. And enormous as the expense would be,\r\nwhen we have become properly aroused and awake to the huge and almost\r\nincredible burden which this disease, with its one hundred and fifty\r\nthousand deaths a year, is now imposing upon the United States,--five\r\ntimes as great as that of war or standing army in the most military-mad\r\nstate in Christendom,--the community will ultimately assume this\r\nexpense. So long, however, as our motto inclines to remain, \"Millions\r\nfor cure, but not one cent for prevention,\" we shall dodge this issue.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that each state and each municipality of\r\nmore than ten thousand inhabitants ought to provide an open-air camp or\r\ncolony of sufficient capacity to receive all those who are willing to\r\ntake the cure but unable to meet the expense of a private institution;\r\nand, also, some institution of adequate size, to which could be sent, by\r\nprocess of law, all those consumptives who, either through perversity,\r\nor the weakness and wretchedness due to their disease, or the apathy of\r\napproaching dissolution, fail or are unable to take proper precautions.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the careful investigations of the various\r\ndispensaries for the treatment of tuberculosis in our larger cities, New\r\nYork, Boston, Cleveland, report that on an average twenty to thirty per\r\ncent of all children living in the same room or apartment with a\r\nconsumptive member of their family are found to show some form of\r\ntuberculosis, it will be seen how well worth while, from every point of\r\nview, this provision for the removal and sanatorium treatment of the\r\npoorer class of these unfortunates would be. These dispensaries now\r\nhave, as a most important part of their campaign against the disease,\r\none or more visiting nurses, who, whenever a patient with tuberculosis\r\nis brought into the dispensary, visit him in his home, show him how to\r\nventilate and light his rooms as well as may be, give practical\r\ndemonstrations of the methods of preventing the spread of the disease,\r\nadvise him as to his food, and see that he is supplied with adequate\r\namounts of milk and eggs, and, finally, round up all the children of the\r\nfamily and any adults who are in a suspicious condition of health, and\r\nbring them to the dispensary for examination. Distressing as are these\r\nfindings, reaching in some cases as high as fifty and sixty per cent of\r\nthe children, they have already saved hundreds of children, and\r\nprevented hundreds of others from growing up crippled or handicapped.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the tubercle bacillus causes not merely\r\ndisease of the lungs in children but also a large majority of the\r\ncrippling diseases of the bones, joints, and spine, together with the\r\nwhole group of strumous or scrofulous disorders, and a large group of\r\nintestinal diseases and of brain lesions, resulting in convulsions,\r\nparalysis, hydrocephalus, and death. The battle-ground of the future\r\nagainst tuberculosis is the home.\r\n\r\nWe speak of the churchyard as \"haunted,\" and we recoil in horror from\r\nthe leper-house or the cholera-camp. Yet the deadliest known hotbed of\r\nhorrors, the spawning ground of more deaths than cholera, smallpox,\r\nyellow fever, and the bubonic plague combined, is the dirty floor of the\r\ndark, unventilated living-room, whether in city tenement or village\r\ncottage, where children crawl and their elders spit.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to the credit of our species that for convincing, actual\r\ndemonstrations of what can be done toward stamping out tuberculosis, by\r\nmeasures directed against the bacillus alone, we are obliged to turn to\r\nthe lower animals. By a humiliating paradox we are never quite able to\r\nput ourselves under those conditions which we know to be ideal from a\r\nsanitary point of view. There are too many prejudices, too many vested\r\ninterests, too many considerations of expense to be reckoned with. But\r\nwith the lower animals that come under our care we have a clear field,\r\nfree from obstruction by either our own prejudices or those of others.\r\nIn this realm the stamping out of tuberculosis is not merely a rosy\r\ndream of the future but an accomplished fact, in some quarters even an\r\nold story. Two illustrations will suffice, one among domestic animals,\r\nthe other among wild animals in captivity. The first is among pure-bred\r\ndairy cattle, the pedigreed Jerseys and Holsteins. No sooner did the\r\ndiscovery of the bacillus provide us with a means of identification,\r\nthan the well-known \"_perlsucht_\" of the Germans, or \"grapes\" of the\r\nEnglish veterinarians--both names being derived from the curious rounded\r\nmasses or nodules of exudate found in the pleural cavity and the\r\nperitoneum (around the lungs and the bowels), and supposed to resemble\r\npearls and grapes respectively--were identified as tuberculosis, and\r\ncows were found very widely infected with it. This unfortunately still\r\nremains the case with the large mass of dairy cattle. But certain of the\r\nmore intelligent breeders owning valuable cattle proceeded to take steps\r\nto protect them.\r\n\r\nThe first step was to test their cows with tuberculin, promptly weeding\r\nout and isolating all those that reacted to the disease. It was at first\r\nthought necessary to slaughter all these at once. But it was later found\r\nthat, if they were completely isolated and prevented from communicating\r\nthe disease to others, this extreme measure was necessary only with\r\nthose extensively diseased. The others could be kept alive, and if their\r\ncalves were promptly removed as soon as born, and fed only upon\r\nsterilized or perfectly healthy milk, they would be free from the\r\ndisease. And thus the breeding-life of a particularly valuable and\r\nhigh-bred animal might be prolonged for a number of years. They must,\r\nhowever, be kept in separate buildings and fields, and preferably upon a\r\nseparate farm from the rest of the herd.\r\n\r\nThose cows found healthy were given the best of care, including a marked\r\ndiminution of the amount of housing or confinement in barns, and were\r\nagain tested at intervals of six months, several times, to weed out any\r\nothers which might still have the infection in their systems. In a short\r\ntime all signs of the disease disappeared, and no other cases developed\r\nin these herds unless fresh infection was introduced from without. To\r\nguard against this, each farm established a quarantine station, where\r\nall new-bought animals, after having been tested with tuberculin and\r\nshown to be free from reaction, are kept for a period of at least a\r\nyear, for careful observation and study, before being allowed to mix\r\nwith the rest of the herd. It is now a common requirement among\r\nintelligent breeders of pedigreed cattle to demand, as a formal\r\ncondition of sale, their submission to the tuberculin test, or the\r\ncertificate of a competent veterinarian that the animal has been so\r\ntested without reacting. Protected herds have now been in existence\r\nunder these conditions, notably in Denmark, where the method was first\r\nreduced to a system under the able leadership of Professor Bang, of\r\nCopenhagen, for ten years with scarcely a single case of tuberculosis\r\ndeveloping. Only a fraction of one per cent of calves from the most\r\ndiseased mothers are born diseased.\r\n\r\nNot only is the method spreading rapidly among the more intelligent\r\nclass of breeders, but many progressive countries of Europe and states\r\nof our Union require the passing of the tuberculin test as a requisite\r\nto the admission within their borders of cattle intended for breeding\r\npurposes. So that, while the problem is still an enormous one, it is now\r\nconfidently believed that complete eradication of bovine tuberculosis is\r\nonly a question of time.\r\n\r\nThe other instance furnishes a much more crucial test, as it is carried\r\nout upon wild animals under the unfavorable conditions of captivity in a\r\nstrange climate, like our slum-dwellers from sunny Italy, and comes home\r\nto us more closely in many respects, inasmuch as it is concerned with\r\nour nearest animal relatives on the biological side--monkeys and apes,\r\nin zoölogical gardens.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis is a perfectly frightful scourge to these unfortunate\r\ncaptives, causing not infrequently thirty, fifty, and even sixty per\r\ncent of the deaths. This, however, is only in keeping with their\r\nfrightful general mortality. The collection of monkeys in the London\r\nZoo, for instance, some fifteen years ago, was absolutely exterminated\r\nby disease and started over afresh _every three years_, a death-rate of\r\nthirty-five per cent per annum as compared with our human rate of about\r\ntwo per cent per annum. Here, it would seem, was an instance where there\r\nwas little need to call in the bacillus. Brought from a tropical climate\r\nto one of raw, damp fog and smoke, from the freedom of the air-roads\r\nthrough the tree-tops to the confinement of dismal and often dirty cages\r\nin a stuffy, overheated house, condemned to a diet which at best could\r\nbe but a feeble and far-distant imitation of their natural food, it\r\nseemed little wonder that they \"jes' natcherly pined away an' died.\"\r\n\r\nBut let the results speak. A thorough system of quarantine was enforced,\r\nbeginning with one of the Vienna gardens, and finally reaching one of\r\nits most brilliant and successful exemplifications in our own New York\r\nZoölogical Gardens in the Bronx. All animals purchased or donated were\r\ntested with tuberculin, and those that reacted were either painlessly\r\ndestroyed or disposed of. Those which appeared to be immune were kept in\r\na thoroughly healthy, sanitary quarantine station for six months or a\r\nyear, and again tested by tuberculin before being introduced into the\r\ncages. The original stock of monkeys was treated in the same manner or\r\nelse destroyed completely, and the houses and cages thoroughly cleaned\r\nand sterilized or new ones constructed. Keepers employed in the\r\nmonkey-house were carefully tested for signs of tuberculosis, and\r\nrejected or excluded if any appeared. Signs were posted forbidding any\r\nexpectoration or feeding of the animals (which latter is often done\r\nwith nuts or fruit which had been cracked or bitten before being handed\r\nto the monkeys) by the general public, and these rules were strictly\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the houses were thoroughly ventilated and exposed to\r\nsunlight as much as possible, and the animals were turned out into open\r\nair cages whenever the weather would possibly permit. As a result the\r\nmortality from tuberculosis promptly sank from thirty per cent to five\r\nor six per cent. In our Bronx Zoo, for instance, it has become decidedly\r\nrare as a cause of death in monkeys, no case having occurred in the\r\nmonkey-house for eighteen months past. What is even more gratifying, the\r\ngeneral mortality declined also, though in less proportion, so that,\r\ninstead of losing twenty-five to thirty per cent of the animals in the\r\nhouse every year, a mortality of ten to fifteen per cent is now\r\nconsidered large.\r\n\r\nAnd to think that we might achieve the same results in our own species\r\nif we would only treat ourselves as well as we do our monkey captives!\r\nTo \"make a monkey of one's self\" might have its advantages from a\r\nsanitary point of view.\r\n\r\n\"But this method,\" some one will remind us, \"would silence only a part\r\nof the enemy's infection batteries.\" Even supposing that we could\r\nprevent the spread of the disease from human sources, what of the animal\r\nconsumptives and their deadly bacilli? If the milk that we drink, and\r\nthe beef, pork, and poultry that we eat, are liable to convey the\r\ninfection, what hope have we of ever stopping the invasion?\r\n\r\nThe question is a serious one. But here again a thorough and careful\r\nstudy of the enemy's position has shown the danger to be far less than\r\nit appeared at first sight. Even bacilli have what the French call \"the\r\ndefects of their virtues.\" Their astonishing and most disquieting powers\r\nof adjustment, of accommodation to the surroundings in which they find\r\nthemselves, namely, the tissues and body-fluids of some particular host\r\nwhom they attack, bring certain limitations with them. Just in so far as\r\nthey have adjusted themselves to live in and overcome the opposition of\r\nthe body-tissues of a certain species of animals, _just to that degree\r\nthey have incapacitated themselves to live in the tissues of any other\r\nspecies_.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting and far-reachingly important work that has\r\nbeen done in the bacteriology of tuberculosis of late years has\r\nconcerned itself with the changes that have taken place in different\r\nvarieties and strains of tubercle bacilli as the result of adjusting\r\nthemselves to particular environments. The subject is so enormous that\r\nonly the crudest outlines can be given here, and so new that it is\r\nimpossible to announce any positive conclusions. But these appear to be\r\nthe dominant tendencies of thought in the field so far.\r\n\r\nThough nearly all domestic animals and birds, and a majority of wild\r\nanimals under captivity, are subject to the attack of tuberculosis,\r\npractically all the infections hitherto studied are caused by one of\r\nthree great varieties or species of the tubercle bacillus: the _human_,\r\ninfesting our own species; the _bovine_, attacking cattle; and the\r\n_avian_, inhabiting the tissues of birds, especially the domestic fowl.\r\nThese three varieties or species so closely resemble one another that\r\nthey were at one time regarded as identical, and we can well remember\r\nthe wave of dismay which swept over the medical world when Robert Koch\r\nannounced that the \"_perlsucht_\" of cattle was a genuine and\r\nunquestioned tuberculosis due to an unmistakable tubercle bacillus. But\r\nas these varieties were thoroughly and carefully studied, it was soon\r\nfound that they presented definite marks of differentiation, until now\r\nthey are universally admitted to be distinct varieties, each with its\r\nown life peculiarities, and, according to some authorities, even\r\ndistinct species.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" we fancy we hear some one inquire impatiently, \"what do those\r\nacademic, technical distinctions matter to us? Whether the avian\r\ntuberculosis germ is a variety or a true species may be left to the\r\ntaxonomists, but it is of no earthly importance to us.\"\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, it is of the greatest importance. For the distinctive\r\nfeature about a particular species of parasite is that it will live and\r\nflourish where another species will die, and, vice versa, _will die in\r\nsurroundings where its sister species might live and thrive_.\r\n\r\nOne of the first differences found to exist among these three types of\r\nbacteria was the extraordinary variation in their power of attacking\r\ndifferent animals. For instance, while the guinea-pig and the rabbit\r\ncould be readily inoculated with _human_ bacilli, they could only be\r\ninfected with difficulty by cultures of the _bovine_ bacillus; while the\r\nonly animal that could be inoculated at all with the _avian_ or bird\r\nbacillus was the rabbit, and he only occasionally. In fact,\r\nbacteriologists soon came to the consoling conclusion that the _avian_\r\nbacillus might be practically disregarded as a source of danger to human\r\nbeings, so widely different were the conditions in their moist and\r\nmoderately warm tissues to those of the dry and superheated tissues of\r\nthe bird to which it had adjusted itself for so many generations.\r\n\r\nAnd next came the bold pronunciamento of no less an authority than Koch\r\nhimself, that the bovine bacillus also was so feebly infective to human\r\nbeings that it might be practically disregarded as a source of danger.\r\nThis promptly split the bacteriologists of the world into two opposing\r\ncamps, and started a warfare which is still being waged with great\r\nvigor. As the question is still under hot dispute by even the highest\r\nauthorities, it is, of course, impossible to pronounce any definite\r\nconclusions. But the net result to date appears to be that while Koch\r\nmade a serious error of judgment in declaring that meat and milk as a\r\nsource of danger to human beings of tuberculosis might be disregarded,\r\nyet, for practical purposes, his position is, in the main, correct: the\r\nactual danger from the bovine bacillus to human beings is relatively\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing whatever improbable, in the first place, in the\r\ncorrectness of Koch's position.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the few consoling facts, well known to all students of\r\ncomparative pathology or the diseases of the different species of\r\nanimals, how peculiarly specialized they are in the choice of their\r\ndiseases, or, perhaps, to put it more accurately, how particular and\r\nrestricted disease-germs are in their choice of a host. For instance,\r\nout of twenty-eight actually infectious diseases which are most common\r\namong the domestic animals and man, other than tuberculosis, only\r\none--_rabies_--is readily communicable to more than three species; only\r\nthree--_anthrax_, _tetanus_, and _foot-and-mouth disease_--are\r\ncommunicable to two species; while the remainder are almost absolutely\r\nconfined to one species, even though this be thrown into closest contact\r\nwith half a dozen others.\r\n\r\nAgain, we have half a dozen similar instances in the case of\r\ntuberculosis itself. The horse and the sheep, for instance, are both\r\nmost intimately associated with cattle, pastured in the same fields, fed\r\nupon the same food, and yet tuberculosis is almost unknown in sheep and\r\ndecidedly uncommon in horses, and when it does occur in them is from a\r\nhuman source. The goat is almost equally immune from both human and\r\n_bovine_ forms, while the cat and the dog, although developing the\r\ninfection with a low degree of frequency, almost invariably trace that\r\ninfection to a human source.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, no _a priori_ reason whatever why we should be any\r\nmore susceptible to bovine tuberculosis than the remainder of the\r\ndomestic animals. It is only fair to say, however, that the animal whose\r\ndiet--and appetite--most closely resembles ours, the hog, is quite\r\nfairly susceptible to bovine tuberculosis if fed upon the milk or meat\r\nof tuberculous cattle.\r\n\r\nNext came the particularly consoling fact that although nothing has been\r\nmore striking than the great increase in the amounts of meat and milk\r\nconsumed by the mass of the community during our last twenty years'\r\nprogress in civilization, this has been accompanied not by any increase\r\nof tuberculosis, but by a _diminution of from thirty-five to forty-five\r\nper cent_. The allegation so frequently made that there has been an\r\nincrease in the amount of infantile tuberculosis has been shown, upon\r\ncareful investigation by Shennan of Edinburgh, Guthrie of London, Kossel\r\nin Germany, Comby in France, Bovaird in New York, and others, to be\r\npractically without foundation.\r\n\r\nThen, while repetitions of Koch's experiment, upon which his\r\nannouncement was based, of inoculating calves and young cattle with\r\n_human_ bacilli have proved that a certain number of them can be, under\r\nappropriate circumstances, made to develop tuberculosis, that number has\r\nnever been a large percentage of the animals tested, and in many cases\r\nthe infection has been a local one, or of a mild type, which has\r\nresulted in recovery. Lastly, while a number of bacilli, with _bovine_\r\nculture and other characteristics, have been recovered from the bodies\r\nof children dying of tuberculosis, and these bacilli have proved\r\nvirulent to calves when injected into them, yet, as a matter of\r\nhistorical fact, the actual number of instances in which children or\r\nother human beings have been definitely proved to have contracted the\r\ndisease from the milk of a tuberculous cow is still exceedingly and\r\nencouragingly small. A careful study of the entire literature of the\r\npast twenty years, some three years ago, revealed _only thirty-seven\r\ncases_; and of these thirty-seven Koch's careful investigations have\r\nsince disproved the validity of nine.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is anything but safe to accept Koch's practical\r\ndictum and neglect the meat and milk of cattle as a source of danger in\r\ntuberculosis. First, because the degree of our immunity against the\r\nbovine bacilli is still far from settled; and, second, because, while\r\nbacteriologists are fairly agreed that the _avian_, the _bovine_, and\r\nthe _human_ represent three distinct and different variations, if not\r\nspecies, of the bacillus, they are almost equally agreed that they are\r\nprobably the descendants of one common species, which may possibly be a\r\nbacillus commonly found upon meadow grasses, particularly the well-known\r\ntimothy, and hence very frequently in the excreta of cattle, and known\r\nas the _grass bacillus_ or _dung bacillus_ of M[oe]ller. This bacillus\r\nhas all the staining, morphological, and even growth characteristics of\r\nthe tubercle bacillus except that it produces only local irritation and\r\nlittle nodular masses, if injected into animals. Our knowledge of its\r\nexistence is, however, of great practical importance, inasmuch as it\r\nwarned us that in our earlier studies of the bacilli contained in milk\r\nand butter we have been mistaking this organism for a genuine tubercle\r\nbacillus. As a consequence, of late years our tests for the presence of\r\ntubercle bacilli in milk are made not only by searching for the organism\r\nwith the microscope, but also by injecting the centrifugated sediment of\r\nthe infected milk into guinea pigs, to see if it proves infectious. Many\r\nof our earlier statements as to the presence of tubercle bacilli in milk\r\nand butter are now invalidated on this account.\r\n\r\nNot only are the three varieties of tubercle bacilli probably of common\r\norigin, but they may, under certain peculiar conditions, be transformed\r\ninto one another, or, at least, enabled to live under the conditions\r\nfavorable to one another. This was shown nearly fifteen years ago by the\r\ningenious experiments of Nocard, the great veterinary pathologist. He\r\ntook a culture of bovine bacilli, which were entirely harmless to fowls,\r\nand, inclosing them in a collodion capsule, inserted them into the\r\nperitoneal cavity of a hen. The collodion capsule permitted the fluids\r\nof the body to enter and provide food for the bacilli, but prevented the\r\nadmission of the leucocytes to attack and destroy them. After several\r\nweeks the capsule was removed, the bacilli found still alive, and\r\ntransferred to another capsule in another fowl. When this process had\r\nbeen repeated some five or six times, the last generation of bacilli was\r\ninjected into another fowl, which promptly developed tuberculosis,\r\nshowing that by gradually exposing the bacilli for successive\r\ngenerations to the high temperature of the bird's body (from five to\r\nfifteen degrees above that of the mammal), they had become acclimated,\r\nas it were, and capable of developing. So that it is certainly quite\r\nconceivable that bovine bacilli introduced in milk or meat might manage\r\nto find a haven of refuge or lodgment in some out-of-the-way gland or\r\ntissue of the human body, and there avoid destruction for a sufficiently\r\nlong time to become acclimated and later infect the entire system.\r\n\r\nThis is the method which several leaders in bacteriology, including\r\nBehring (of antitoxin fame), believe to be the principal source and\r\nmethod of infection of the human species. The large majority, however,\r\nof bacteriologists and clinicians are of the opinion that ninety per\r\ncent of all cases of human tuberculosis are contracted from some human\r\nsource. So that, while we should on no account slacken our fight against\r\ntuberculosis in either cattle or birds, and should encourage in every\r\nway veterinarians and breeders to aim for its total destruction,--a\r\nconsummation which would be well worth all it would cost them, purely\r\nupon economic grounds, just as the extermination of human tuberculosis\r\nwould be to the human race,--yet we need not bear the burden of feeling\r\nthat the odds against us in the fight for the salvation of our own\r\nspecies are so enormous as they would be, had we no natural protection\r\nagainst infection from animals and birds.\r\n\r\nThe more carefully we study all causes of tuberculosis in children, the\r\nlarger and larger percentage of them do we find to be clearly traceable\r\nto infection from some member of the family or household. In Berlin, for\r\ninstance, Kayserling reports that seventy per cent of all cases\r\ndiscovered can be traced to direct infection from some previous human\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nLastly, what of the left wing of our army of extermination, composed of\r\nthose light-horse auxiliaries--the general progress and new developments\r\nof civilization, and the net results upon the individual of the\r\nexperiences of his ancestors, which we designate by the term \"heredity\"?\r\nFor many years we were in serious doubt how far we could depend upon the\r\nloyalty of this group of auxiliaries, and many of the faint-hearted\r\namong us were inclined to regard their sympathies as really against us\r\nrather than with us, and prepared to see them desert to the enemy at any\r\ntime. It was pointed out, as of great apparent weight, that consumption\r\nwas decidedly and emphatically a disease of civilization; that it was\r\nborn of the tendency of men to gather themselves into clans and nations\r\nand crowd themselves into villages and those hives of industry called\r\ncities; that the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis in any community\r\nof a nation or any ward of a city was high in direct proportion to the\r\ndensity of its population; and that the whole tendency of civilization\r\nwas to increase this concentration, this congestion of ground space,\r\nthis piling of room upon room, of story upon story. How could we\r\npossibly, in reason, expect that the influences which had caused the\r\ndisease could help us to cure it?\r\n\r\nBut the improbable has already happened. Never has there been a more\r\nrapid and extraordinary growth of our great cities as contrasted with\r\nour rural districts, never has there been a greater concentration of\r\npopulation in restricted areas than during the past thirty-five years.\r\nAnd yet, the prevalence of tuberculosis in that time, in all civilized\r\ncountries of the earth, has shown not only no increase, _but a decrease\r\nof from thirty-five to fifty per cent_. To-day the world power which has\r\nthe largest percentage of its inhabitants gathered within the limits of\r\nits great cities, England, has the lowest death-rate in the civilized\r\nworld from tuberculosis, although closely pressed within the last few\r\nyears by the United States, whose percentage of urban population is\r\nalmost equally large, while England's sister island, Ireland, with one\r\nof the highest percentages of rural and the lowest of urban population,\r\nhas one of the highest death-rates from tuberculosis, and one which is,\r\nunfortunately, increasing.\r\n\r\nThe real cure for the evils of civilization would appear to be _more\r\ncivilization_, or, better, perhaps, _higher_ civilization. Nor are these\r\nexceptional instances. Take practically any city, state, or province in\r\nthe civilized world, which has had an adequate system of recording all\r\nbirths and deaths for more than thirty years, and you will find a\r\ndecrease in the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis in that time of\r\nfrom twenty to forty per cent. The city of New York's death-roll, for\r\ninstance, from tuberculosis, per one thousand living, is some\r\nthirty-five per cent less than it was thirty years ago. So that our\r\nfight against the disease is beginning to bear fruit already. As Osler\r\nputs it, we run barely half the risk of dying of tuberculosis that our\r\nparents did and barely one-fourth of that of our grandparents.\r\n\r\nBut this gratifying improvement goes deeper, and is even more\r\nsignificant than this. It is, of course, only natural to expect that our\r\nvigorous fight against the spread of the infection of the disease would\r\ngive us definite results. But the interesting feature of the situation\r\nis that this diminution in England and in Germany, for instance, began\r\nnot merely twenty, but thirty, forty, even fifty years ago--two decades\r\nbefore we even knew that tuberculosis was an infectious disease with a\r\ncontagion that could be fought.\r\n\r\nIn the case of England, for instance, we have the, at first sight,\r\nanomalous and even improbable fact that the rate of decline in the\r\ndeath-rate from tuberculosis for the twenty years preceding the\r\ndiscovery of Koch's bacillus was almost as great as it has been in the\r\ntwenty years since. In other words, the general tendency, born of\r\ncivilization, toward sanitary reform, better housing, better drainage,\r\nhigher wages and consequently more abundant food, rigid inspection of\r\nfood materials, factory laws, etc., is of itself fighting against and\r\ndiminishing the prevalence of the \"great white plague\" by improving the\r\nresisting power and building up the health of the individual.\r\nCivilization is curing its own ills.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that vital statistics, showing the decrease of a\r\ngiven disease within the past forty or fifty years, probably represent\r\nnot merely a real decrease of the amount indicated by the figures but an\r\neven greater one in fact; because each succeeding decade, as our\r\nknowledge of disease and the perfection of our statistical machinery\r\nimproves and increases, is sure to show a prompter recognition and a\r\nmore thorough and complete reporting of all cases of the disease\r\noccurring. Statistics, for instance, showing a moderate apparent rate of\r\n_increase_ of a disease within the last thirty years are looked upon by\r\nstatisticians as really indicating that it is at a standstill. It is\r\nalmost certain that at least from ten to twenty per cent more of the\r\ncases actually occurring will be recognized during life and reported\r\nafter death than was possible with our more limited knowledge and less\r\neffective methods of registration thirty years ago. So we need not\r\nhesitate to encourage ourselves to renewed effort by the reflection that\r\nwe are enlisted in a winning campaign, one in which the battle-line is\r\nalready making steady and even rapid progress, and which can have only\r\none termination so long as we retain our courage and our common-sense.\r\n\r\nThis decline of the tuberculosis death-rate is, of course, only a part\r\nof the general improvement of physique which is taking place under\r\ncivilization. If we could only get out from under the influence of the\r\n\"good old times\" obsession and open our eyes to see what is going on\r\nabout us! There is nothing mysterious about it. The soundest of physical\r\ngrounds for improving health can be seen on every hand. We point with\r\nhorror, and rightly, to the slum tenement house, but forget that it is a\r\nmore sanitary human habitation than even the houses of the nobility in\r\nthe Elizabethan age. We become almost hysterical over the prospect that\r\nthe very fibre of the race is to be rotted by the adulteration of our\r\nfood-supply, by oleomargarine in the butter, by boric acid in our canned\r\nmeats, by glucose in our sugar, and aniline dyes in our candies, but\r\nforget that all these things represent extravagant luxuries unheard of\r\nupon the tables of any but the nobility until within the past two\r\nhundred, and in some cases, one hundred, years. Up to three hundred\r\nyears ago even the most highly civilized countries of Europe were\r\nsubject to periodic attacks of famine; our armies and navies were swept\r\nand decimated with scurvy, from bad and rotten food-supplies; almost\r\nevery winter saw epidemics breaking out from the use of half-putrid\r\nsalted and cured foods; only forty years ago, a careful investigation of\r\none of our most conservative sociologists led him to the conclusion\r\nthat in Great Britain _thirty per cent of the population never in all\r\ntheir lives had quite as much as they could eat_, and for five months\r\nout of the year were never comfortably warm. The invention of steam,\r\nwith its swift and cheap transportation of food-supplies, putting every\r\npart of the earth under tribute for our tables, meat every day instead\r\nof once a week for the workingman, and the introduction of sugar in\r\ncheap and abundant form, with the development of the dietary in fruits\r\nand cereals which this has made possible, have done more to improve the\r\nresisting power and build up the physique of the mass of the population\r\nin our civilized communities, than ten centuries of congestion and\r\nnerve-worry could do to break it down.\r\n\r\nWe shake our heads, and prate fatuously that \"there were giants in those\r\ndays,\" ignorant of the thoroughly attested fact, that the average\r\nstature of the European races has increased some four inches since the\r\ndays of the Crusaders, as shown by the fact that the common British\r\nsoldier of to-day--Mr. Kipling's renowned \"Tommy Atkins,\" who is looked\r\nupon by the classes above him in the social scale as a short, undersized\r\nsort of person--can neither fit his chest and shoulders into their\r\narmor, get his hands comfortably on the hilts of their famous two-handed\r\nswords, nor even lie down in their coffins.\r\n\r\nWe are at last coming to acknowledge with our lips, although we scarcely\r\ndare yet to believe it in our heart of hearts, that not merely the\r\ndeath-rate from tuberculosis, but the general death-rate from all causes\r\nin civilized communities, is steadily and constantly declining; that\r\nthe average longevity has increased nearly ten years within the memory\r\nof most of us, chiefly by the enormous reduction in the mortality from\r\ninfant diseases; and that, though the number of individuals in the\r\ncommunity who attain a great or notable age is possibly not increasing,\r\nthe percentage of those who live out their full, active life, play their\r\nman's or woman's part in the world, and leave a group of properly fed,\r\nvigorous, well-trained, and educated children behind them to carry on\r\nthe work of the race, is far greater than ever before. Even in our\r\nmuch-denounced industrial conditions, made possible by the discovery of\r\nsteam with its machinery and transportation, the gain has far exceeded\r\nthe loss. While machinery has made the laborer's task more monotonous\r\nand more confining, the net result has been that it has shortened his\r\nhours and increased his efficiency.\r\n\r\nEven more important, it has increased his intelligence by demanding and\r\nfurnishing a premium for higher degrees of it. Naturally, one of the\r\nfirst uses which he has made of his increased intelligence has been to\r\ndemand better wages and to combine for the enforcement of his demands.\r\nThe premium placed upon intelligence has led both the broader-minded,\r\nmore progressive, and more humane among employers, and the more\r\nintelligent among employees, to recognize the commercial value of\r\nhealth, and of sanitary surroundings, comfort, and healthy recreations,\r\nas a means of promoting this. The combined results of these forces are\r\nseen in the incontestable, living fact that the death-rate from\r\ntuberculosis among intelligent artisans and in well-regulated factory\r\nsuburbs is already below that of many classes of outdoor and even farm\r\nlaborers, whose day is from twelve to fourteen hours, and whose children\r\nare worked, and often overworked, from the time that they can fairly\r\nwalk alone, with as disastrous and stunting results as can be found in\r\nany mine or factory. Child-labor is one of the oldest of our racial\r\nevils, instead of, as we often imagine, the newest.\r\n\r\nAll over the civilized world to-day the average general death-rate of\r\neach city, slums included, is now below that of many rural districts in\r\nthe same country. If I were to be asked to name the one factor which had\r\ndone more than any other to check the spread and diminish the death-rate\r\nfrom tuberculosis I should unhesitatingly say, the _marked increase of\r\nwages among the great producing masses of the country_, with the\r\nconsequent increased abundance of food, better houses, better sanitary\r\nsurroundings, and last, but not least, shorter hours of labor.\r\n\r\n_Underfeeding and overwork are responsible for more deaths from\r\ntuberculosis than any other ten factors._ Rest and abundant feeding are\r\nthe only known means for its cure.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the reasons why the medical profession has abandoned all\r\nthought of endeavoring to fight the disease single-handed, and is\r\nstriving and straining every nerve to enlist the whole community in the\r\nfight. Its burden rests, not upon the unfortunate individual who has\r\nbecome tuberculous, but _upon the community_ which, by its ignorance,\r\nits selfishness, and its greed, has done much to make him so. What\r\ncivilization has _caused_ it is under the most solemn obligation to\r\n_cure_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne more brigade of irregular troops on the extreme left remains to be\r\nbriefly reviewed, and that is those forces resulting from the successive\r\nexposure of generations to the physical influences of civilization,\r\nincluding the infectious diseases. For years we never dreamed of even\r\nattempting to raise any levies among these border tribes of more than\r\ndoubtful loyalty. Indeed, they were supposed to be our open enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen we first attempted to take a world-view of tuberculosis, the first\r\ngreat fact that stood out plainly was that it was emphatically a disease\r\nof the walled town and the city; that the savage and the nomad barbarian\r\nwere practically free from it; that range cattle and barnyard fowls\r\nseldom fell victims to it, while their housed and confined cousins in\r\nthe dairy barn and the breeding-pens suffered frightfully. It was one of\r\nour commonplace sayings that we must \"get back to nature,\" get away from\r\nthe walled city into the open country, revert from the conditions of\r\ncivilization in a considerable degree to those of barbarism, in order to\r\nescape. While, as for heredity, its influence was almost dead against\r\nus. How could a race be exposed to a disease like tuberculosis,\r\ngeneration after generation, without having its vital resistance\r\nimpaired?\r\n\r\nBut a marked and cheering change has come over our attitude to this wing\r\nof the battle of life. So far from regarding it as in any sense\r\nnecessary to revert to barbarism, still less to savagery, for either\r\nthe prevention or the cure of disease, we have discovered by the most\r\nconvincing, practical experience, that we can, in the first place, with\r\nthe assistance of the locomotive and trolley, combined with modern\r\nbuilding skill and sanitary knowledge, put even our city-dwellers under\r\nconditions, in both home and workshop, which will render them far less\r\nlikely to contract tuberculosis than if they were in a peasant's cottage\r\nor _the average farmhouse or merchant's house_ of a hundred years ago,\r\nto say nothing of the cave, the dugout, or the hut of the savage.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, instead of simply \"going back to nature\" and living\r\nin brush-shelters on what we can catch or shoot, it takes _all the\r\nresources of civilization_ to place our open-air patients in the ideal\r\nconditions for their recovery. Let any consumptive be reckless enough to\r\n\"go back to nature,\" unencircled by the strong arm of civilized\r\nintelligence and power, and unprotected by her sanitary shield, and\r\nnature will kill him three times out of five. There could not be a more\r\ndangerous delusion than the all-too-common one--that all that is\r\nnecessary for the cure of consumption is to turn the victim loose among\r\nthe elements, even in the mildest and most favorable of climates.\r\n\r\nHe must be fed upon the most abundant and nutritious of foods, even the\r\nsimplest being milk of a richness which is given by no kind of wild\r\ncattle, and which, indeed, only the most carefully bred and highly\r\ncivilized strains of domestic cattle are capable of producing; eggs such\r\nas are laid by no wild bird or by any but the most highly specialized\r\nof domestic poultry at the season of the year when they are most\r\nrequired; steaks and chops, hams and sides of bacon, sugar and fruits\r\nand nuts, which simply _are not produced anywhere outside of\r\ncivilization_, and often only in the most intelligent and progressive\r\nsections of civilized communities.\r\n\r\nPut him upon even the average diet of many people in this progressive\r\nand highly civilized United States the year round,--with its thin milk,\r\nits pulpy, half-sour butter, its tough meat, its half-rancid pickled\r\npork, its short three months of really fresh vegetables and good fruit,\r\nand six months of eternal cabbage, potatoes, dried apples, and\r\nprunes,--and he will fail to build up the vigor necessary to fight the\r\ndisease, even in the purest and best of air.\r\n\r\nThe saddest and most pitiful tragedies which the consumptive\r\nhealth-resort physician can relate are those of wretched\r\nsufferers,--even in a comparatively early stage of the disease,--whose\r\nmisguided but well-meaning friends have raised money enough to pay their\r\nfare out to Colorado, California, Arizona, or New Mexico, and expect\r\nthem to get work on a ranch, so as to earn their living and take the\r\nopen-air treatment at the same time.\r\n\r\nThree things are absolutely necessary for a reasonable prospect of cure\r\nof consumption. One is, abundance of fresh air, day and night. Another,\r\nabundance of the best quality of food. And the third, absolute--indeed,\r\nenforced--rest during the period of fever. Let any one of these be\r\nlacking, and your patient will die just as certainly as if all three\r\nwere. _Not one in five_ of those who go out to climates with even a high\r\nreputation as health-resorts--expecting to earn their own living or to\r\n\"rough it\" in shacks or tents on three or four dollars a week, doing\r\ntheir own cooking and taking care of themselves--recovers. They have a\r\nfour-to-one chance of recovery in _any_ climate in which they can obtain\r\nthese three simple requisites, and a four-to-one chance of dying in any\r\nclimate in which any one of these is lacking.\r\n\r\nInstead of nature being able to cure the consumptive unaided, as a\r\nmatter of fact she has neither the ability nor the inclination to do\r\nanything of the sort. There is no class of patients whose recovery\r\ndepends more absolutely upon a most careful and intelligent study and\r\nregulation of their diet, of every detail of their life throughout the\r\nentire twenty-four hours, and of the most careful adjustment of air,\r\nfood, heat, cold, clothing, exercise, recreation, by the combined forces\r\nof sanitarian, nurse, and physician. So that, instead of feeling that\r\nonly by reverting to savagery can consumption be prevented, we have no\r\nhesitation in saying that it is _only under civilization, and\r\ncivilization of the highest type, that we have any reasonable prospect\r\nof cure_.\r\n\r\nFinally, we are getting over our misgivings as to the intentions of the\r\nhereditary brigade. It is certainly not our enemy, and may probably turn\r\nout to be one of our best friends.\r\n\r\nOur first sidelight on this question came in rather a surprising manner.\r\nIt was taken for granted, almost as axiomatic, that if the conditions of\r\nsavage life were such as to discourage, if not prevent, tuberculosis,\r\ncertainly, then, the race which had been exposed to these conditions for\r\ncountless generations would have a high degree of resisting power to the\r\ndisease. But what an awakening was in store for us! No sooner did the\r\narmy surgeon and medical missionary settle down in the wake of that\r\nextraordinary world-movement of Teutonic unrest, which has resulted in\r\nthe colonization of half the globe within the past two or three hundred\r\nyears, than it was discovered that, although the hunting or nomad savage\r\nhad not developed tuberculosis, and the disease was emphatically born of\r\ncivilization, yet the moment that these healthy and vigorous children of\r\nnature were exposed to its infection, instead of showing the high degree\r\nof resisting power that might be expected, they died before it like\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nFrom all over the world--from the Indians of our Western plains, the\r\nnegroes of our Southern States, the islanders of Polynesia, New Zealand,\r\nHawaii, Samoa--came reports of tribes practically wiped out of existence\r\nby the \"White Plague\" of civilization. To-day the death-rate from\r\ntuberculosis among our Indian wards is from _three to six times_ that of\r\nthe surrounding white populations. The negro population of the Southern\r\nStates has nearly three times the death-rate of the white populations of\r\nthe same states. Instead of centuries of civilization having made us\r\nmore susceptible to the disease than those savages who probably most\r\nnearly parallel our ancestral conditions of a thousand to fifteen\r\nhundred years ago, we seem to have acquired from three to five times\r\ntheir resisting power against it. Not only this, but those races among\r\nus which have been continuous city-dwellers for a score of generations\r\npast have acquired a still higher degree of immunity.\r\n\r\nIn every civilized land the percentage of deaths from tuberculosis among\r\nthe Jews, who, from racial and religious prejudices, have been prisoners\r\nof the Ghetto for centuries, is about half to one-third that of their\r\nGentile neighbors. In certain blocks of the congested districts of New\r\nYork and Chicago, for instance, the Jewish population shows a death-rate\r\nof only one hundred and sixty-three per hundred thousand living, while\r\nthe Gentile inhabitants of similar blocks show the appalling rate of\r\nfive hundred and sixty-five. Similarly, by a strange apparent paradox,\r\nthe highest mortality from tuberculosis in the United States is not in\r\nthose states having the greatest urban population, but, on the contrary,\r\nin those having the largest rural population.\r\n\r\nThe ten highest state tuberculosis death-rates contain the names of\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, and South Carolina, while\r\nNew York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts are among the lowest.\r\n\r\nThe subject is far too wide and complicated to admit of any detailed\r\ndiscussion here. But, explain it as we may, the consoling fact remains\r\nthat civilized races, including slum-dwellers, have a distinctly lower\r\ndeath-rate from tuberculosis than have savage tribes which are exposed\r\nto it even under most favorable climatic and hygienic conditions; that\r\nthose races which have survived longest in city and even slum\r\nsurroundings have a lower death-rate than the rest of the community\r\nunder those conditions; and that certain of our urban populations have\r\nlower death-rates than many of our rural ones.\r\n\r\nAs for the immediate effect of heredity in the production of the\r\ndisease, the general consensus of opinion among thoughtful physicians\r\nand sanitarians now is that direct infection is at least five times as\r\nfrequent a factor as is heredity; that at least eight-tenths of the\r\ncases occurring in the children of tuberculous parents are probably due\r\nto the direct communication of the disease, and that if the spread of\r\nthe infection could be prevented, the element of heredity could be\r\npractically disregarded.\r\n\r\nWe are inclined to regard even the well-marked tendency of tuberculosis\r\nto attack a considerable number of the members of a given family to be\r\ndue largely, in the first place, to direct infection; secondly, to the\r\nfact that that family were all submitted to the same unfavorable\r\nenvironment in the matter of food, of housing, of overwork, or of the\r\nNew England conscience, with its deadly belief that \"Satan finds some\r\nmischief still for idle hands to do.\"\r\n\r\nUpon direct pathological grounds nothing is more definitely proven than\r\nthat the actual inheritance of tuberculosis, in the sense of its\r\ntransmission from a consumptive mother to the unborn child, is one of\r\nthe rarest of occurrences. On the other hand, the feeling is general\r\nthat, inasmuch as probably four-fifths of us are repeatedly exposed to\r\nthe infection of tuberculosis and throw it off without developing a\r\nsystemic attack of the disease, the development of a generalized\r\ninfection, such as we term consumption, is in itself a sign of a\r\nresisting power below the average. Should such an individual as this\r\nbecome a parent, the strong probability is that his children--unless, as\r\nfortunately often happens, their other parent should be as far above the\r\naverage of vigor and resisting power--would not be likely to inherit\r\nmore vigor than that possessed by their ancestry. So that upon _a\r\npriori_ grounds we should expect to find that the children born of\r\ntuberculous parents would be more susceptible to the infection to which\r\nthey are so sure to be exposed than the average of the race. So that the\r\nmarriage of consumptives should, unquestionably, upon racial grounds, be\r\ndiscouraged except after they have made a complete recovery and remained\r\nwell at least five years.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: while the earlier steps of civilization unquestionably\r\nprovide that environment which is necessary for the development of\r\ntuberculosis, the later stages, with their greatly increased power over\r\nthe forces of nature, their higher intelligence and their broader\r\nhumanity, not merely have it in their power to destroy it, but are\r\nalready well on the way to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SCOURGE\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only have most diseases a living cause, and a consequent natural\r\nhistory and course, but they have a special method of attack, which\r\nlooks almost like a preference. It seems little wonder that the\r\nterror-stricken imagination of our Stone Age ancestors should have\r\npersonified them as demons, \"attacking\" or leaping upon their victims\r\nand \"seizing\" them with malevolent delight. The concrete comparison was\r\nready to their hand in the attack of fierce beasts of prey; and as the\r\ntiger leaps for the head to break the neck with one stroke of his paw,\r\nthe wildcat flies at the face, the wolf springs for the slack of the\r\nflank or the hamstring, so these different disease demons appear each to\r\nhave its favorite point of attack: smallpox, the skin; cholera, the\r\nbowels; the Black Death, the armpits and the groin; and pneumonia, the\r\nlung.\r\n\r\nThere are probably few diseases which are so clearly recognized by every\r\none and about which popular impressions are in the main so clear-cut and\r\nso correct as pneumonia. The stabbing pain in the chest, the cough, the\r\nrusty or blood-stained expectoration, the rapid breathing, all stamp it\r\nunmistakably as a disease of the lung. Its furious onset with a\r\nteeth-chattering chill, followed by a high fever and flushed face, and\r\nits rapid course toward recovery or death, mark it off sharply from all\r\nother lung infections.\r\n\r\nIts popular names of \"lung fever,\" \"lung plague,\" \"congestion of the\r\nlungs,\" are as graphic and distinctive as anything that medical science\r\nhas invented. In fact, our most universally accepted term for it,\r\npneumonia, is merely the Greek equivalent of the first of these.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how many of our disease-enemies appear to have a\r\npreference for the lung as a point of attack. In the language of _Old\r\nMan Means_ in \"The Hoosier Schoolmaster,\" the lung is \"their fav'rit\r\nholt.\" Our deadliest diseases are lung diseases, headed by consumption,\r\nseconded by pneumonia, and followed by bronchitis, asthma, etc.;\r\ntogether, they manage to account for one-fourth to one-third of all the\r\ndeaths that occur in a community, young or old. No other great organ or\r\nsystem of the body is responsible for more than half such a mortality.\r\nNow this bad eminence has long been a puzzle, since, foul as is the air\r\nor irritating as is the gas or dust that we may breathe into our lungs,\r\nthey cannot compare for a moment with the awful concoctions in the shape\r\nof food which are loaded into our stomachs. Even from the point of view\r\nof infections, food is at least as likely to be contaminated with\r\ndisease-germs as air is. Yet there is no disease or combination of\r\ndiseases of the whole food canal which has half the mortality of\r\nconsumption alone, in civilized communities, while in the Orient the\r\npneumonic form of the plague is a greater scourge than cholera.\r\n\r\nIt has even been suggested that there may possibly be a historic or\r\nancestral reason for this weakness to attack, and one dating clear back\r\nto the days of the mud-fish. It is pointed out that the lung is the last\r\nof our great organs to develop, inasmuch as over half of our family tree\r\nis under water. When our mud-loving ancestor, the lung-fish (who was\r\nprobably \"one of three brothers\" who came over in the Mayflower--the\r\nrecords have not been kept) began to crawl out on the tide-flats, he had\r\nevery organ that he needed for land-life in excellent working condition\r\nand a fair degree of complexity: brain, stomach, heart, liver, kidneys;\r\nbut he had to manufacture a lung, which he proceeded to do out of an old\r\nswim-bladder. This, of course, was several years ago. But the lung has\r\nnot quite caught up yet. The two or three million year lead of the other\r\norgans was too much to be overcome all at once. So carelessly and\r\nhastily was this impromptu lung rigged up that it was allowed to open\r\nfrom the front of the gullet or [oe]sophagus, instead of the back, while\r\nthe upper part of the mouth was cut off for its intake tube, as we have\r\nalready seen in considering adenoids, thus making every mouthful\r\nswallowed cut right across the air-passages, which had to be provided\r\nwith a special valve-trap (the epiglottis) to prevent food from falling\r\ninto the lungs.\r\n\r\nSo, whenever you choke at table, you have a right to call down a\r\nbenediction upon the soul of your long departed ancestor, the lung-fish.\r\nHowever applicable or remote we may regard \"the bearin's of this\r\nobservation,\" the practical and most undesirable fact confronts us\r\nto-day that this crossing and mutual interference of the air and the\r\nfood-passages is a fertile cause of pneumonia, inasmuch as the germs of\r\nthis disease have their habitat in the mouth, and are from that\r\nlurking-place probably inhaled into the lung, as is also the case with\r\nthe germs of several milder bronchitic and catarrhal affections.\r\n\r\nIt may be also pointed out that, history apart, our lung-cells at the\r\npresent day are at another disadvantage as compared with all the other\r\ncells of the body, except those of the skin; and that is, that they are\r\nin constant contact with air, instead of being submerged in water.\r\nNinety-five per cent of our body-cells are still aquatic in their\r\nhabits, and marine at that, and can live only saturated with, and bathed\r\nin, warm saline solution. Dry them, or even half-dry them, and they die.\r\nEven the pavement-cells coating our skin surfaces are practically dead\r\nbefore they reach the air, and are shed off daily in showers.\r\n\r\nWe speak of ourselves as \"land animals,\" but it is only our lungs that\r\nare really so. All the rest of the body is still made up of sea\r\ncreatures. It is little wonder that our lungs should pay the heaviest\r\npenalty of our change from the warm and equable sea water to the gusty\r\nand changeable air.\r\n\r\nEven if we have set down the lung as a point of the least resistance in\r\nthe body, we have by no means thereby explained its diseases. Our point\r\nof view has distinctly shifted in this respect within recent years.\r\nTwenty years ago pathologists were practically content with tracing a\r\ncase of illness or death to an inflammation or disease of some\r\nparticular organ, like the heart, the kidney, the lung, or the stomach.\r\nNow, however, we are coming to see that not only may the causation of\r\nthis heart disease, kidney disease, lung disease, have lain somewhere\r\nentirely outside of the heart, kidney, or lung, but that, as a rule, the\r\nentire body is affected by the disease, which simply expresses itself\r\nmore violently, focuses, as it were, in this particular organ. In other\r\nwords, diseases of definite organs are most commonly the local\r\nexpressions of general diseases or infections; and this local\r\naggravation of the disease would never have occurred if the general\r\nresisting power and vigor of the entire body had not been depressed\r\nbelow par. So that even in guarding against or curing a disease of a\r\nparticular organ it is necessary to consider and to treat the whole\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nNowhere is this new attitude better illustrated than in pneumonia. Frank\r\nand unquestioned infection as it is, wreaking two-thirds of its visible\r\ndamage in the lung itself, the liability to its occurrence and the\r\noutlook for its cure depend almost wholly upon the general vigor and\r\nrallying power of the entire body. It is perfectly idle to endeavor to\r\navoid it by measures directed toward the protection of the lung or of\r\nthe air-passages, and equally futile to attempt to arrest its course by\r\ntreatment directed to the lung, or even the chest. The best place to\r\nwear a chest-protector is on the soles of the feet, and poulticing the\r\nchest for pneumonia is about as effective as shampooing the scalp for\r\nbrain-fag.\r\n\r\nThis clears the ground of a good many ancient misconceptions; for\r\ninstance, that the chief cause of pneumonia is direct exposure to cold\r\nor a wetting, or the inhalation of raw, cold air. Few beliefs were more\r\nfirmly fixed in the popular mind--and, for the matter of that, in the\r\nmedical--up to fifteen or twenty years ago. It has found its way into\r\nliterature; and the hero of the shipwreck in an icy gale or of weeks of\r\nwandering in the Frozen North, who must be offered up for artistic\r\nreasons as a sacrifice to the plot, invariably dies a victim of\r\npneumonia, from his \"frightful exposure,\" just as the victim of\r\ndisappointed love dies of \"a broken heart,\" or the man who sees the\r\nambitions of years come crashing about his ears, or the woman who has\r\nlost all that makes life worth living, invariably develops \"brain\r\nfever.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a physical basis for all of these standard catastrophes, but it\r\nis much slenderer than is usually supposed. For instance, almost every\r\none can tell you how friends of theirs have \"brought on congestion of\r\nthe lungs,\" or pneumonia, by going without an overcoat on a winter day,\r\nor breaking through the ice when skating, or even by getting their feet\r\nwet and not changing their stockings; and this single dramatic instance\r\nhas firmly convinced them that the chief cause of \"lung fever\" is a\r\nchill or a wetting. Yet when we come to tabulate long series of causes,\r\nrising into thousands, we find that the percentage in which even the\r\npatients themselves attribute the disease to exposure, or a chill, sinks\r\nto a surprisingly small amount. For instance, in the largest series\r\ncollected with this point in mind, that of Musser and Norris, out of\r\nforty-two hundred cases only seventeen per cent gave a history of\r\nexposure and \"catching cold\"; and the smaller series range from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent. So that, even in the face of the returns, not more\r\nthan one-fifth of all cases of pneumonia can reasonably be attributed to\r\nchill. And when we further remember that under this heading of exposure\r\nand \"catching cold\" are included many mere coincidences and the chilly\r\nsensations attending the beginning of those milder infections which we\r\nterm \"common colds,\" it is probable that even this small percentage\r\ncould be reduced one-half. Indeed, most cautious investigators of the\r\nquestion have expressed themselves to this effect. This harmonizes with\r\na number of obstinate facts which have long proved stumbling-blocks in\r\nthe way of the theory of exposure as a cause of pneumonia. One of the\r\nclassic ones was that, during Napoleon's frightful retreat from Moscow\r\nin the dead of winter, while his wretched soldiers died by thousands of\r\nfrost-bite and starvation, exceedingly little pneumonia developed among\r\nthem. Another was that, as we have already seen with colds, instead of\r\nbeing commoner and more frequent in the extreme Northern climate and on\r\nthe borders of the Arctic Zone, pneumonia is almost unknown there. Of\r\ncourse, given the presence of the germ, prolonged exposure to cold may\r\ndepress the vital powers sufficiently to permit an attack to develop.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ages at which pneumonia is both most common and most deadly,\r\nnamely, under five and over sixty-five, are precisely those at which\r\nthis feature of exposure to the weather plays the most insignificant\r\npart. Last and most conclusive of all, since definite statistics have\r\nbegun to be kept upon a large scale, pneumonia has been found to be\r\nemphatically a disease of cities, instead of country districts. Even\r\nunder the favorable conditions existing in the United States, for\r\ninstance, the death-rate per hundred thousand living, according to the\r\nlast census, was in the cities two hundred and thirty-three, and for the\r\ncountry districts one hundred and thirty-five,--in other words, nearly\r\nseventy per cent greater in city populations.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did the impression become so widely spread and so firmly\r\nrooted that pneumonia is chiefly due to exposure? Two things, I think,\r\nwill explain most of this. One is, that the disease is most common in\r\nthe winter-time, the other, that like all febrile diseases it most\r\nfrequently begins with sensations of chilliness, varying all the way\r\nfrom a light shiver to a violent chill, or _rigor_. The savage,\r\nbone-freezing, teeth-rattling chill which ushers in an attack of\r\npneumonia is one of the most striking characteristics of the disease,\r\nand occurs in twenty-five to fifty per cent of all cases.\r\n\r\nIts chief occurrence in the winter-time is an equally well-known and\r\nundisputed fact, and it has been for centuries set down in medical works\r\nas one of the diseases chiefly due to changes in temperature, humidity,\r\nand directions of the wind. Years of research have been expended in\r\norder to trace the relations between the different factors in the\r\nweather and the occurrence of pneumonia, and volumes, yes, whole\r\nlibraries, published, pointing out how each one of these factors, the\r\ntemperature, humidity, direction of wind, barometric pressure, and\r\nelectric tension, is in succession the principal cause of the spread of\r\nthis plague. Many interesting coincidences were shown. But one thing\r\nalways puzzled us, and that was, that the heaviest mortality usually\r\noccurred, not just at the beginning of winter, when the shock of the\r\ncold would be severest, nor even in the months of lowest temperature,\r\nlike December or January, but in the late winter and the early spring.\r\nThroughout the greater part of the temperate zone the death-rate for\r\npneumonia begins to rise in December, increases in January, goes higher\r\nstill in February, reaching its climax in that month or in March. April\r\nis almost as bad, and the decline often doesn't fairly set in until May.\r\n\r\nNo better illustration could probably be given of the danger of drawing\r\nconclusions when you are not in possession of all the facts. One thing\r\nwas entirely overlooked in all this speculation until about twenty years\r\nago,--that pneumonia was due not simply to the depressing effects of\r\ncold, but to a specific germ, the pneumococcus of Fraenkel. This threw\r\nan entirely new light upon our elaborate weather-causation theories. And\r\nwhile these still hold the field by weight of authority and that mental\r\ninertia which we term conservatism, yet the more thoughtful physicians\r\nand pathologists are now coming to regard these factors as chiefly\r\nimportant according to the extent to which we are crowded together in\r\noften badly lighted and ill-ventilated houses and rooms, with the\r\nwindows and doors shut to save fuel, thus affording a magnificent\r\nhothouse hatching-ground for such germs as may be present, and ideal\r\nfacilities for their communication from one victim to another. At the\r\nsame time, by this crowding and the cutting off of life and exercise in\r\nthe open air which accompanies it, the resisting power of our bodies is\r\nlowered. And when these two processes have had an opportunity of\r\nprogressing side by side for from two to three months; when, in other\r\nwords, the soil has been carefully prepared, the seed sown, and the\r\nmoist heat applied as in a forcing-house, then we suddenly reap the\r\nharvest. In other words, the heavy crop of pneumonia in January,\r\nFebruary, and March is the logical result of the seed-sowing and forcing\r\nof the preceding two or three months.\r\n\r\nThe warmth of summer is even more depressing in its immediate effects\r\nthan the cold of winter, but the heat carries with it one blessing, in\r\nthat it drives us, willy-nilly, into the open air, day and night. And on\r\nlooking at statistics we find precisely what might have been expected on\r\nthis theory, that the death-rate for pneumonia is lowest in July and\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nIt might be said in passing that, in spite of our vivid dread of\r\nsunstroke, of cholera, and of pestilence in hot weather, the hot months\r\nof the year in temperate climates are invariably the months of fewest\r\ndiseases and fewest deaths. Our extraordinary dread of the summer heat\r\nhas but slender rational physical basis. It may be but a subconscious\r\nafter-vibration in our brain cells from the simoons, the choleras, and\r\nthe pestilences of our tropical origin as a race. Open air, whether hot,\r\ncold, wet, dry, windy, or still, is our best friend, and house air our\r\ndeadliest enemy.\r\n\r\nIf this view be well founded, then the advance of modern civilization\r\nwould tend to furnish a more and more favorable soil for the spread of\r\nthis disease. This, unfortunately, is about the conclusion to which we\r\nare being most unwillingly driven. Almost every other known infectious\r\ndisease is diminishing, both in frequency and in fatality, under\r\ncivilization. Pneumonia alone defies our onslaughts. In fact, if\r\nstatistics are to be taken at their surface-value, we are facing the\r\nappalling situation of an apparently marked increase both in its\r\nprevalence and in its mortality. For a number of years past, ever since,\r\nin fact, accurate statistics began to be kept, pneumonia has been listed\r\nas the second heaviest cause of death, its only superior being\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nAbout ten years ago it began to be noticed that the second competitor in\r\nthe race of death was overtaking its leader, and this ghastly rivalry\r\ncontinued until about three years ago pneumonia forged ahead. In some\r\ngreat American cities it now occupies the bad eminence of the most fatal\r\nsingle disease on the death-lists.\r\n\r\nThe situation is, however, far from being as serious and alarming as it\r\nmight appear, simply from this bald statement of statistics. First of\r\nall, because the forging ahead of pneumonia has been due in greater\r\ndegree to the falling behind of tuberculosis than to any actual advance\r\non its part. The death-rate of tuberculosis within the last thirty years\r\nhas diminished between thirty and forty per cent; and pneumonia at its\r\nworst has never yet equaled the old fatality of tuberculosis.\r\nFurthermore, all who have carefully studied the subject are convinced\r\nthat much of this apparent increase is due to more accurate and careful\r\ndiagnosis. Up to ten years or so ago it was generally believed that\r\npneumonia was rare in young children. Now, however, that we make the\r\ndiagnosis with a microscope, we discover that a large percentage of the\r\ncases of capillary bronchitis, broncho-pneumonia, and acute congestion\r\nof the lung in children are due to the presence of the pneumococcus.\r\nSimilarly, at the other end of the line, deaths that were put down to\r\nbronchitis, asthma, heart failure, yes, even to old age, have now been\r\nshown on bacteriological examination to be due to this ubiquitous imp of\r\nmalevolence; so that, on the whole, all that we are probably justified\r\nin saying is that pneumonia is not decreasing under civilization. This\r\nis not to be wondered at, inasmuch as the inevitable crowding and\r\ncongestion which accompanies civilization, especially in its derivative\r\nsense of \"citification,\" tends to foster it in every way, both by\r\nmultiplying the opportunities for infection and lowering the resisting\r\npower of the crowded masses.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was only in the last ten years, yes, within the last five\r\nyears, that we fairly grasped the real method and nature of the spread\r\nof the disease, and recognized the means that must be adopted against\r\nit. And as all of these factors are matters which are not only\r\nabsolutely within our own control, but are included in that programme of\r\ngeneral betterment of human comfort and vigor to which the truest\r\nintelligence and philanthropy of the nation are now being directed, the\r\noutlook for the future, instead of being gloomy, is distinctly\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nOur chief difficulty in discovering the cause of pneumonia lay in the\r\nswarm of applicants for the honor. Almost every self-respecting\r\nbacteriologist seemed to think it his duty to discover at least one, and\r\nthe abundance and variety of germs constantly or accidentally present in\r\nthe human saliva made it so difficult positively to isolate the real\r\ncriminal that, although it was identified and described as long ago as\r\n1884 by Fraenkel, the validity of its claim was not generally recognized\r\nand established until nearly ten years later.\r\n\r\nIt is a tiny, inoffensive-looking little organism, of an oval or\r\nlance-head shape, which, after masquerading under as many aliases as a\r\nconfidence man, has finally come to be called the pneumococcus, for\r\nshort, or \"lung germ.\" Though by those who are more precise it is still\r\nknown as the _Diplococcus pneumoniæ_ or _Diplococcus lanceolatus_, from\r\nits faculty of usually appearing in pairs, and from its lance-like\r\nshape. Its conduct abounds in \"ways that are dark and tricks that are\r\nvain,\" whose elucidation throws a flood of light upon a number of\r\ninteresting problems in the spread of disease.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it literally fulfills the prognostic of Scripture, that \"a\r\nman's foes shall be they of his own household,\" for its chosen abiding\r\nplace and normal habitat is no less intimate a place than the human\r\nmouth. Outside of this warm and sheltering fold it perishes quickly, as\r\ncold, sunlight, and dryness are alike fatal to it.\r\n\r\nWe could hardly believe the evidence of our senses when studies of the\r\nsaliva of perfectly healthy individuals showed this deadly little\r\nbacillus to be present in considerable numbers in from fifteen to\r\nforty-five per cent of the cases examined. Why, then, does not every one\r\ndevelop pneumonia? The answer to this strikes the keynote of our modern\r\nknowledge of infectious disease, namely, that while an invading germ is\r\nnecessary, a certain breaking down of the body defenses and a lowering\r\nof the vital resistance are equally necessary. These invaders lie in\r\nwait at the very gates of the citadel, below the muzzles of our guns, as\r\nit were, waiting for some slackening of discipline or of watchfulness to\r\nrush in and put the fortress to sack. Nowhere is this more strikingly\r\ntrue than in pneumonia. It is emphatically a disease where, in the\r\nlanguage of the brilliant pathologist-philosopher Moxon, \"While it is\r\nmost important to know what kind of a disease the patient has got, it is\r\neven more important to know what kind of a patient the disease has got.\"\r\n\r\nThe death-rate in pneumonia is an almost mathematically accurate\r\ndeduction from the age, vigor, and nutrition of the patient attacked. No\r\nother disease has such a brutal and inveterate habit of killing the\r\nweaklings. The half-stifled baby in the tenement, the underfed,\r\noverworked laboring man, the old man with rigid arteries and stiffening\r\nmuscles or waning life vigor, the chronic sufferer from malnutrition,\r\nalcoholism, Bright's disease, heart disease--_these_ are its chosen\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature about the pneumococcus is its vitality\r\noutside of the body. If the saliva in which it is contained be kept\r\nmoist, and not exposed to the direct sunlight and in a fairly warm place,\r\nit may survive as long as two weeks. If dried, but kept in the dark, it\r\nwill survive four hours. If exposed to sunlight, or even diffuse\r\ndaylight, it dies within an hour. In other words, under the conditions\r\nof dampness and darkness which often prevail in crowded tenements it may\r\nremain alive and malignant for weeks; in decently lighted and ventilated\r\nrooms, less than two hours. This explains why, in private practice and\r\nunder civilized conditions, epidemics of this admittedly infectious\r\ndisease are rare; while in jails, overcrowded barracks, prison ships,\r\nand winter camps of armies in the field they are by no means uncommon.\r\nThis is vividly supported by the fact brought out in our later\r\ninvestigations of the sputum of slum-dwellers, carried out by city\r\nboards of health, that the percentage of individuals harboring the\r\npneumococcus steadily increases all through the winter months, from ten\r\nper cent in December to forty-five, fifty, and even sixty per cent in\r\nFebruary and March. The old proverb, \"When want comes in at the door,\r\nLove flies out at the window,\" might be revised to read, \"When sunlight\r\ncomes in at the window the pneumococcus flies 'up the flue.'\"\r\n\r\nAuthorities are still divided as to the meaning and even the precise\r\nfrequency of the occurrence of the pneumococcus in the healthy human\r\nmouth. Some hold that its presence is due to recent infection which has\r\neither been unable to gain entrance to the system or is preparing its\r\nattack; others, that it is a survival from some previous mild attack of\r\nthe disease, and the body tissues having acquired immunity against it,\r\nit remains in them as a harmless parasite, as is now well known to be\r\nthe case with the germs of several of our infectious diseases--for\r\ninstance, typhoid--for months and even years afterward. Others hold the\r\nhighly suggestive view that it is a normal inhabitant of the healthy\r\nmouth, which can become injurious to the body, or _pathogenic_, only\r\nunder certain depressed or disturbed conditions of the latter. In\r\ndefense of this last it may be pointed out that dental bacteriologists\r\nhave now already isolated and described some thirty different forms of\r\norganisms which inhabit the mouth and teeth; and the pneumococcus may\r\nwell be one of these. Further, that a number of our most dangerous\r\ndisease germs, like the typhoid bacillus, the bacillus of tuberculosis,\r\nand the bacillus of diphtheria, have almost perfect \"doubles,\"\r\nlaw-abiding relatives, so to speak, among the germs that normally\r\ninhabit our throats, our intestines, or our immediate surroundings. The\r\nultimate foundation question of the science of bacteriology is, How did\r\nthe disease germs become disease germs? But the question is still\r\nunanswered.\r\n\r\nHowever, fortunately, here, as in other human affairs, imperfect as our\r\nknowledge is, it is sufficient to serve as a guide for practical\r\nconduct. Widely present as the pneumococcus is, we know well that it is\r\npowerless for harm except in unhealthful surroundings. There is another\r\ninteresting feature of its life history which is of practical\r\nimportance, and that is, like many other bacilli it is increased in\r\nvirulence and infectiousness by passing through the body of a patient.\r\nFlushed with victory over a weakened subject, it acquires courage to\r\nattack a stronger. This is the reason why, in those comparatively\r\ninfrequent instances in which pneumonia runs through a family, it is the\r\nstrongest and most vigorous members of the family who are the last to be\r\nattacked. It also explains one of the paradoxes of this disease, that,\r\nwhile emphatically a disease of overcrowding and foul air, and attacking\r\nchiefly weakened individuals, it is a veritable scourge of camps,\r\nwhether mining or military. When once three or four cases of pneumonia\r\nhave occurred in a mining camp, even though this consist almost\r\nexclusively of vigorous men, most of them in the prime of life, it\r\nacquires a virulence like that of a pestilence, so that, while\r\nordinarily not more than fifteen to twenty per cent of those attacked\r\ndie, death-rates of forty, fifty, and even seventy per cent are by no\r\nmeans uncommon in mining camps. The fury and swiftness of this \"miners'\r\npneumonia\" is equally incredible. Strong, vigorous men are taken with a\r\nchill while working in their sluicing ditches, are delirious before\r\nnight, and die within forty-eight hours. So widely known are these\r\nfacts, and so dreaded is the disease throughout the Far West and in\r\nmountain regions generally, that there is a widespread belief that\r\npneumonia at high altitudes is particularly deadly.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to interest myself in this question some years ago, and\r\nby writing to colleagues practicing at high elevations and collecting\r\nreports from the literature, especially of the surgeons of army posts in\r\nmountain regions, was somewhat surprised to find that the mortality of\r\nall cases occurring above five thousand feet elevation was almost\r\nidentical with that of a similar class of the population at sea-level.\r\nIt is only when a sufficient number of cases occur in succession to\r\nraise the virulence of the pneumococcus in this curious manner that an\r\nepidemic with high fatality develops.\r\n\r\nThat this increase in virulence in the organism does occur was clearly\r\ndemonstrated by a bacteriologist friend of mine, who succeeded in\r\nsecuring some of the sputum from a fatal case in the famous Tonopah\r\nepidemic of some years ago, an epidemic so fatal that it was locally\r\nknown as the \"Black Death.\" Upon injecting cultures from this sputum\r\ninto guinea-pigs, the latter died in one-quarter of the time that it\r\nusually took them to succumb to a similar dose of an ordinary culture of\r\nthe pneumococcus.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that just as \"no chain is stronger than its\r\nweakest link,\" so in the broad sense no community is stronger than its\r\nweakest group of individuals, and pneumonia, like other epidemics, may\r\nbe well described as the vengeance which the \"submerged tenth\" may wreak\r\nfrom time to time upon their more fortunate brethren.\r\n\r\nNow that we know that under decent and civilized conditions of light and\r\nventilation the pneumococcus will live but an hour to an hour and a\r\nhalf, this reduces the risk of direct infection under these conditions\r\nto a minimum. It is obvious that the principal factors in the control of\r\nthe disease are those which tend to build up the vigor and resisting\r\npower of all possible victims. The more broadly we study the disease the\r\nmore clearly do the data point in this direction.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, is the vivid and striking contrast between hospital\r\nstatistics and those gathered from private practice. While many\r\nindividuals of a fair wage-earner's income and good bodily vigor are\r\ntreated in our hospitals, yet the vast majority of hospital patients are\r\ntechnically known as the \"hospital classes,\" apt to be both underfed,\r\noverworked, and overcrowded. On the other hand, while a great many both\r\nof the very poor and even of the destitute are treated in private\r\npractice, yet the majority of such cases who feel \"able to afford a\r\ndoctor,\" as they say, are among the comparatively vigorous, well-fed,\r\nand well-housed section of the community. And the difference between the\r\ndeath-rate of the two classes in pneumonia is most significant. In\r\nprivate practice, while epidemics differ in virulence, the rate ranges\r\nall the way from five per cent to fifteen per cent, the average being\r\nnot much in excess of ten per cent, occasionally falling as low as three\r\nper cent. In the hospital reports on the contrary the death-rate begins\r\nat twenty per cent and climbs to thirty, forty, and forty-five per cent.\r\nIt is only fair to say, of course, that hospital statistics probably\r\ninclude a larger percentage of more serious cases, the milder ones being\r\ntaken care of at home, or not presenting themselves for treatment at\r\nall. But even when this allowance has been made, the contrast is\r\nconvincing.\r\n\r\nA similar influence is exercised by age. Although pneumonia is common at\r\nall ages, its heaviest death-rate falls at the two extremes, under six\r\nyears of age and over sixty, with a strong preponderance in the latter.\r\nUnder five years of age, the mortality may reach twenty to thirty per\r\ncent; from five to twenty-five, not more than four to five per cent;\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty-five, from fifteen to twenty per cent; and so\r\non, increasing gradually with every decade until by sixty years of age\r\nthe mortality has reached fifty per cent, and from sixty to seventy-five\r\nmay be expressed in terms of the age of the patient. One consoling\r\nfeature, however, about it is that its mortality is lowest in the ages\r\nat which it is most frequent, namely, from ten to thirty-five years of\r\nage. And its frequency diminishes even more rapidly than its fatality\r\nincreases in later years. So that while it is much more serious in a\r\nmiddle-aged man, he is less liable to develop it than a younger one.\r\nWhere the mortality from pneumonia is highest, is in the most densely\r\npopulated wards, especially among negroes and foreigners of the hospital\r\nclass, in individuals who are victims of chronic alcoholism, and also\r\namong those who are for long periods insufficiently nourished. Lastly,\r\nit is only within comparatively recent years that we have come clearly\r\nto recognize the large rôle which pneumonia plays in giving the\r\nfinishing stroke to chronic diseases and degenerative processes. It is,\r\nfor instance, one of the commonest actual causes of death in Bright's\r\ndisease, in diabetes, in lingering forms of tuberculosis, and in heart\r\ndisease; and last of all, in that progressive process of normal\r\ndegeneration and decay which we term \"Old Age.\" It is one of the most\r\nfrequent and fatal of what Flexner described a decade ago as \"terminal\r\ninfections.\" Very few human beings die by a gradual process of decay,\r\nstill less go to pieces all at once, like the immortal \"One-Hoss Shay.\"\r\nJust as soon as the process has progressed far enough to lower the\r\nresisting power below a certain level, some acute infection steps in and\r\nmercifully ends the scene. This is peculiarly true of pneumonia in old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nTo the medical profession to \"die of old age\" is practically equivalent\r\nto dying of pneumonia. The disease is so mild in its symptoms and so\r\nrapid in its course that it often utterly escapes recognition as such.\r\n\r\nThe old man complains of a little pain in his chest, a failure of\r\nappetite, a sense of weakness and dizziness. He takes to his bed, within\r\nforty-eight hours he becomes unconscious, and within twenty-four more he\r\nis peacefully breathing his last. After death, two-thirds of the lung\r\nwill be found consolidated. So mild and rapid and painless is the\r\nprocess that one physician-philosopher actually described pneumonia as\r\n\"the friend of old age.\"\r\n\r\nWhen once the disease has obtained a foothold in the body its course,\r\nlike one of Napoleon's campaigns, is short, sharp, and decisive.\r\nBeginning typically with a vigorous chill, sometimes so suddenly as to\r\nwake the patient out of a sound sleep, followed by a stabbing pain in\r\nthe side, cough, high fever, rapid respiration, the sputum rusty or\r\norange-colored from leakage of blood from the congested lung, within\r\nforty-eight hours the attacked area of the lung has become congested; in\r\nforty-eight more, almost solidified by the thick, sticky exudate poured\r\nout from the blood-vessels, which coagulates and clots in the air cells.\r\nSo complete is this solidification that sections of the attacked lung,\r\ninstead of floating in water as normal lung-tissue will, sink promptly.\r\nThe severe pain usually subsides soon, but the fever, rapid respiration,\r\nflushed face, with or without delirium, will continue for from three to\r\nseven or eight days. Then, as suddenly as the initial attack, comes a\r\nplunge down of the temperature to normal. Pain and restlessness\r\ndisappear, the respiration drops from thirty-five or forty to fifteen or\r\ntwenty per minute, and the disease has practically ended by \"_crisis_.\"\r\nNaturally, after such a furious onslaught, the patient is apt to be\r\ngreatly weakened. He may have lost twenty or thirty pounds in the week\r\nof the fever, and from one to three weeks more in bed may be necessary\r\nfor him to regain his strength. But the chief risk and danger are\r\nusually over within a week or ten days at the outside.\r\n\r\nViolent and serious as are the changes in the lung, it is very seldom\r\nthat death comes by interference with the breathing space. In fact,\r\nwhile regarded as a lung disease, we are now coming to recognize that\r\nthe actual cause of death in fatal cases is the overwhelming of the\r\nheart by the toxins or poisons poured into the circulation from the\r\naffected lung. The mode of treatment is, therefore, to support the\r\nstrength of the patient in every way, and measures directed to the\r\naffected lung are assuming less and less importance in our arsenal of\r\nremedies. Our attitude is now very similar to that in typhoid, to\r\nsupport the strength of the patient by judicious and liberal feeding, to\r\nreduce the fever and tone up his blood-vessels by cool sponging,\r\npacking, and even bathing; to relieve his pain by the mildest possible\r\ndoses of sedatives, knowing that the disease is self-limited, and that\r\nin patients in comfortable surroundings and fair nutrition from eighty\r\nto ninety per cent will throw off the attack within a week. So\r\ncompletely have we abandoned all idea of medicating or protecting the\r\nlung as such, that in place of overheated rooms, loaded with vapor by\r\nmeans of a steam kettle, for its supposed soothing effect upon the\r\ninflamed lung, we now throw the windows wide open. And some of our more\r\nenthusiastic clinicians of wide experience are actually introducing the\r\nopen-air cure, which has worked such wonders in tuberculosis, in the\r\ntreatment of pneumonia. In more than one of our New York hospitals now,\r\nparticularly those devoted to the care of children, following the\r\nbrilliant example of Dr. William Northrup, wards are established for\r\npneumonia cases out on the roof of the hospital, even when the snow is\r\nbanked up on either side, and the covering is a canvas tent. Nurses,\r\nphysicians, and ward attendants are clothed in fur coats and gloves, the\r\npatients are kept muffled up to the ears, with only the face exposed;\r\nbut instead of perishing from exposure, little, gasping, struggling\r\ntots, whose cases were regarded as practically hopeless in the wards\r\nbelow, often fall into the sleep that is the turning point toward\r\nrecovery within a few hours after being placed in this winter\r\nroof-garden.\r\n\r\nIn short, our motto may be said to be, \"Take care of the patient, and\r\nthe disease will take care of itself.\"\r\n\r\nThough pneumonia is one of our most serious and most fatal of diseases,\r\nyet it is one over whose cause, spread, and cure we are obtaining\r\ngreater and greater control every day, and which certainly should,\r\nwithin the next decade, yield to our attack, as tuberculosis and typhoid\r\nare already beginning to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF TYPHOID FEVER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy should not a disease have a natural history, as well as an\r\nindividual? At first sight, this might appear like a reversion to the\r\nold, crude theory of disease as a demonic obsession, or invasion by an\r\nevil spirit, of which traces still remain in such expressions as, \"She\r\nwas _seized_ with a convulsion,\" \"He was strong enough to _throw off_\r\nthe illness,\" \"He was _attacked_ by a fever,\" etc. But apart entirely\r\nfrom such conceptions, which were perfectly natural in the infancy of\r\nthe race, while clearly recognizing that disease is simply a perverted\r\nstate of nutrition or well-being in the body of the patient, a\r\ndisturbance of balance, so to say, yet it is equally true that it has a\r\nbirth, an ancestry, a life-course, and a natural termination, or death.\r\n\r\nThis recognition of the natural causation and development of disease has\r\nbeen one of the greatest triumphs, not merely of pathology, but of\r\nintelligence and rationalism. It has done more to diminish that dread of\r\nthe unknown which hangs like a black pall of terror over the mind of the\r\nsavage and the semi-civilized mind than any other one advance. It\r\ncontributes enormously to our courage, our hopefulness, and our power of\r\nprotection in more ways than one: first of all, by revealing to us the\r\nexternal cause of disease, usually some careless, dirty, or bad habit\r\non the part of an individual or of the community, and thus enabling us\r\nto limit its spread and even exterminate it; secondly, by assuring us\r\nthat nearly all diseases, excepting a few of the most obstinate and\r\nserious, have not only a definite beginning, but a definite end, are, in\r\nfact, if left to themselves, self-limited, either by the exhaustion and\r\nloss of virulence of their cause, or by the resisting power of the body.\r\n\r\nAll infectious diseases, and many others, tend to run a definite course\r\nof so many days, or so many weeks, within certain limits, and at least\r\nninety per cent of them tend to terminate in recovery. It is a most\r\nserious and fatal disease which has a death-rate of more than twenty per\r\ncent. Typhoid, pneumonia, diphtheria, and yellow fever all fall below\r\nthis, smallpox barely reaches it, and only the bubonic plague, cholera,\r\nand lockjaw rise habitually above it. The recognition of this fact has\r\nenormously increased the efficiency of the medical profession in dealing\r\nwith disease, by putting us on the track of imitating the methods which\r\nthe body itself uses for destroying, or checking the spread of, invading\r\ngerms and leading us to trust nature and try to work with her instead of\r\nagainst her. Our antitoxins and anti-serums, which are our brightest\r\nhope in therapeutics at present, are simply antidotes which are formed\r\nin the blood of some healthy, vigorous animal against the bacillus whose\r\nvirulence we wish to neutralize, such as that of diphtheria or\r\nsepticemia.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria antitoxin, for instance, the first and best known triumph of\r\nthe new medicine, is the antidotal substance formed in the blood of a\r\nhorse in response to a succession of increasing doses of the bacilli of\r\ndiphtheria. Similar antidotal substances are formed in the blood in all\r\nother non-fatal cases of infectious diseases, such as typhoid,\r\npneumonia, blood-poisoning, etc.; and the point at which they have\r\naccumulated in sufficient amounts to neutralize the poison of the\r\ninvading germs, forms the crisis, or \"turn\" of the disease. So that when\r\nwe speak of a disease \"running its course,\" we mean continuing for such\r\nlength of time as the body needs to produce anti-bodies in sufficient\r\namounts to check it.\r\n\r\nThe principal obstacle to the securing of antitoxins like that of\r\ndiphtheria for all our infectious diseases is, that their germs form\r\ntheir poison so slowly that it is difficult to collect it in sufficient\r\namounts to produce a strong concentrated antitoxin in the animal into\r\nwhich it is injected. But the overcoming of this difficulty is probably\r\nonly a question of time.\r\n\r\nObviously, if infectious disease be, as we say, \"self-limited,\" that is\r\nto say, if the body will defeat the invaders with its own weapons, on an\r\naverage in nine cases out of ten, our wisest course, as physicians, is\r\nto back up the body in its fight. This we now do in every possible way,\r\nby careful feeding, by rest, by bathing, by an abundance of pure water\r\nand fresh air, with the gratifying result that we have already reduced\r\nthe death-rate in most fevers, even such as we have no antitoxin\r\nagainst, or may not even have discovered the causal germ of, to one-half\r\nand even three-fourths of their former fatality. The recognition of the\r\nfact that disease has a natural history, a birth, a term of natural\r\nlife and a death, has already turned a hopeless fight in the dark into a\r\nvictorious campaign in broad daylight. Huxley's pessimistic saying that\r\ntyphoid was like a fight in the dark between the disease and the\r\npatient, and the doctor like a man with a club striking into the mélée,\r\nsometimes hitting the disease and sometimes the patient, is no longer\r\ntrue since the birth of bacteriology.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the natural history of disease be more clearly seen or more\r\nadvantageously studied than in the case of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThe cause of typhoid is simplicity itself, merely drinking the excreta\r\nof some one else, \"eating dirt,\" in the popular phrase; simple, but of a\r\ndeadly effectiveness, and disgracefully common. The demon may be\r\nexorcised by an incantation of one sentence: _Keep human excreta out of\r\nthe drinking water._ This sounds simple, but it is n't. Eternal\r\nvigilance is the price of health as well as of liberty.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, make our pedigree of typhoid a little more precise. It\r\nis not merely dirt of human origin which is injurious, but dirt of a\r\nparticular type, namely, discharges from a previous case of the disease.\r\nJust as in the fight against malaria we have not the enormous problem of\r\nthe extermination of all varieties of mosquito, but only of one\r\nparticular genus, and only the infected specimens of that, so in\r\ntyphoid, the contamination of water or food which we have to guard\r\nagainst is that from previous cases. From one point of view, this leaves\r\nthe problem as wide as ever, for, obviously, the only way to insure\r\nagainst poisoning of water by typhoid discharges is to shut out\r\nabsolutely all sewage contamination. On the other hand, it is of immense\r\nadvantage in this regard,--it enables us to fight the enemy at both ends\r\nof the line, to turn his flank as well as crush his centre.\r\n\r\nWhile we are protecting our water-supplies against sewage, we can, in\r\nthe meantime, render that sewage comparatively harmless by thoroughly\r\ndisinfecting and sterilizing all discharges from every known case of the\r\ndisease. A similar method is used in the fight against yellow fever and\r\nmalaria. Not only are the breeding places of the two mosquito criminals\r\nbroken up, but each known case of the disease is carefully screened, _so\r\nas to prevent the insects from becoming infected_, and thus able to\r\ntransmit the disease to other human victims.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too emphatically insisted upon that every case of typhoid,\r\nlike every case of yellow fever and of malaria, _comes from a previous\r\ncase_. It is neither healthy nor exhilarating to drink a clear solution\r\nof sewage, no matter how dilute; but, as a matter of fact, it is\r\nastonishing how long communities may drink sewage-laden water with\r\ncomparative impunity, so long as the sewage contains no typhoid\r\ndischarges. One case of typhoid fever imported into a watershed will set\r\na city in a blaze.\r\n\r\nThe malevolent _Deus_ in the sewage _machina_ is, of course, a germ--the\r\n_Bacillus typhosus_ of Eberth. The astonishing recentness of much of our\r\nmost important knowledge is nowhere better illustrated than in the case\r\nof typhoid. Although there had been vague descriptions of a fatal fever,\r\nslow and lingering in its character and accompanied by prolonged stupor\r\nand delirium, which was associated with camps and dirty cities and\r\nfamines, from as far back as the age of Cæsar, the first description\r\nclear enough to be recognizable was that of Willis, of an epidemic\r\nduring the English civil war in 1643, both Royalist and Roundhead armies\r\nbeing seriously crippled by it. Since that time a smouldering, slowly\r\nspreading fever has been pretty constantly associated with armies in\r\ncamps, besieged cities, filthy jails, and famines, to which accordingly\r\nhave been given the names, familiar in historical literature, of \"famine\r\nfever,\" \"jail fever,\" and \"military fever.\"\r\n\r\nSo slowly, however, did accurate knowledge come, that it was actually\r\nnot until 1837 that it was clearly and definitely recognized that this\r\nfamine fever was, like Mrs. Malaprop's Cerberus, \"two gentlemen at\r\nonce,\" one form of it being typhus or \"spotted fever,\" which has now\r\nbecome almost extinct in civilized communities; the other, the milder,\r\nbut more persistent form, which, like the poor, we have always with us,\r\ncalled, from its resemblance to the former, \"typhoid\" (typhus-like).\r\n\r\nTyphus was a far more virulent, rapid, and fatal fever than its twin\r\nsurvivor, though as to the relations between the two diseases, if any,\r\nwe are quite in the dark, as the former practically disappeared before\r\nthe days of bacteriology. The fact of its disappearance is both\r\nsignificant and interesting, in that it was unquestionably due to the\r\nranker and viler forms of both municipal and individual filthiness and\r\nunsanitariness, which even our moderate progress in civilization has\r\nnow abolished. There can be no question that, with a step higher in the\r\nscale of cleanliness, and further quickening of the biologic conscience,\r\ntyphoid will also disappear.\r\n\r\nTyphus, the bubonic plague, the sweating sickness, were alike plagues\r\nand products of times when table-scraps were thrown on the dining-room\r\nfloor and covered daily with fresh rushes for a week at a stretch, and\r\nfertilizer accumulated in a living-room as now in a modern stable.\r\nClothing was put on for the season, shirts were unknown, and strong\r\nperfumes took the place of a bath. Michelet's famous characterization of\r\nthe Middle Ages in one phrase as _Un mille ans sans bain_ (a thousand\r\nyears without a bath) was painfully accurate.\r\n\r\nDoubtless certain habits of our own to-day will be regarded with equal\r\ndisgust by our descendants. Typhus, by the way, may possibly be\r\nremembered by the dramatic \"Black Assize\" of Oxford, in 1577, in which\r\nnot merely the wretched prisoners in the jail, but the jurors, the\r\nlawyers, the judges, and every official of the court were attacked, and\r\nmany of them died.\r\n\r\nIt was only in 1856 that the method of transmission of the disease was\r\nclearly recognized, and in 1880 that the bacillus was discovered and\r\nidentified by the bacteriologist Eberth, whose name it bears, so that it\r\nis only within the last thirty years that real weapons have been put\r\ninto our hands with which to begin a fight of extermination against the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nWhat is the habitat of our organism, and is it increasing its spread?\r\nIts habitat is the entire civilized world, and it goes wherever\r\ncivilization goes. In this sense its spread is increasing, but, in every\r\nother, we have good ground for believing that it is on the wane.\r\nPositive assurance, either one way or the other, is, of course,\r\nimpossible, simply for the reason that the disease was not recognized\r\nuntil such a short time ago that no statistics of any real value for\r\ncomparison are available; and, secondly, because even to-day, on account\r\nof its insidious character and the astonishing variety of its forms, and\r\ndegrees of mildness and virulence, a considerable percentage of cases\r\nare yet unrecognized and unreported.\r\n\r\nIt might be mentioned in passing that this statement applies to the\r\nalleged increase of nearly all diseases which are popularly believed to\r\nbe modern inventions, like appendicitis, insanity, and cancer. We have\r\nno statistics more than thirty years old which are of real value for\r\npurposes of comparison.\r\n\r\nHowever, when it comes to the number of deaths from the disease, there\r\nis a striking and gratifying diminution for twenty years past, which is\r\nincreasing in ratio instead of diminishing. That we are really getting\r\ncontrol of typhoid is shown by the, at first sight, singular and\r\ndecidedly unexpected fact that it is no longer a disease of cities, but\r\nof the country. The death-rate per thousand living in the cities of the\r\nUnited States is lower than in the rural districts. For instance, the\r\nmortality in the State of Maryland, outside of Baltimore, is two and\r\none-half times as great as that in the city itself. Our period of\r\ngreatest outbreak in the large cities is now the month of September,\r\nwhen city dwellers have just returned from their vacations in the pure\r\nand healthful country, bringing the bacilli in their systems.\r\n\r\nThe moral is obvious. Great cities are developing some sort of a\r\nsanitary conscience. Farmers and country districts have as yet little or\r\nnone. Bad as our city water often is, and defective as our systems of\r\nsewage, they cannot for a moment compare in deadliness with that most\r\nunheavenly pair of twins, the shallow well and the vault privy. A more\r\ningenious combination for the dissemination of typhoid than this\r\nprecious couple could hardly have been devised. The innocent householder\r\nsallies forth, and at an appropriate distance from his cot he digs two\r\nholes, one about thirty feet deep, the other about four. Into the\r\nshallower one he throws his excreta, while upon the surface of the\r\nground he flings abroad his household waste from the back stoop. The\r\ngentle rain from heaven washes these various products down into the soil\r\nand percolates gradually into the deeper hole. When the interesting\r\nsolution has accumulated to a sufficient depth, it is drawn up by the\r\nold oaken bucket or modern pump, and drunk. Is it any wonder that in\r\nthis progressive and highly civilized country three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand cases of typhoid occur every year, with a death penalty of ten\r\nper cent? Counting half of these as workers, and the period of illness\r\nas two months, which would be very moderate estimates, gives a loss of\r\nproductive working time equivalent to thirty thousand years. Talk of\r\n\"cheap as dirt\"! It is the most expensive thing there is.\r\n\r\nTyphoid still abundantly earns its old name of \"military fever,\" and its\r\nsinister victories in war are even more renowned than its daily triumphs\r\nin peace. Strange as it may seem, the deadliest enemies of the soldier\r\nare not bullets but bacilli, and sewage is mightier than the sword. For\r\ninstance, in the Franco-Prussian War, typhoid alone caused sixty per\r\ncent of all the deaths. In the Boer War it caused nearly six thousand\r\ndeaths as compared with seven thousand five hundred from wounds in\r\nbattle, while other diseases caused five thousand more. In the majority\r\nof modern campaigns, from two-thirds to five-sixths of all deaths are\r\ndue to disease and not to battle. It may be that we sanitarians will\r\nachieve the ends of the peace congresses by an unexpected route, and\r\nmake war a healthful and comparatively harmless form of national\r\ngymnastics. Its battle-mortality rate, for the number engaged, is not so\r\nvery far above football now!\r\n\r\nGiven the bacillus, how does it get into the human system? Here the\r\nevidence is so abundant and overwhelming that we may content ourselves\r\nwith bald statements of fact. The three great routes of this pestilence\r\nare water, milk, and flies. Of the three, the first is far the most\r\ncommon and important. While only a rough statement is possible, probably\r\neighty-five per cent of all cases from water, five per cent from milk,\r\nfive per cent through flies, and five per cent through other channels,\r\nwould fairly represent the percentage.\r\n\r\nThat it is conveyed through water is as certain as that the sun rises\r\nand sets. The only embarrassment in proving it lies in selecting from\r\nthe swarm of instances. There is the classic case of the Swiss villages\r\non opposite sides of the same mountain chain, the second of which drew\r\nits water-supply from a spring that came through the mountain from a\r\nbrooklet running by the first village. Typhoid fever broke out in the\r\nfirst village, and twenty days later it appeared in the second village,\r\ntwenty miles away on the other side of the mountain. Colored particles\r\nthrown into the brook on one side promptly appeared in the spring upon\r\nthe other. Then there was the gruesome modern instance of Plymouth,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1885. A single case of imported typhoid occurring on\r\nthe watershed of a reservoir was followed, thirty days later, by an\r\nepidemic of eleven hundred cases in a population of eight thousand.\r\n\r\nAn equally vivid instance came under my own observation. A school and a\r\npenitentiary drew their water-supply from the same power-flume, carrying\r\na superb volume of purest water from a mountain stream. Early in the\r\nautumn a single case of typhoid appeared in a small town near the head\r\nof the flume. The discharges were thrown into the swiftly running water.\r\nTwo weeks later an epidemic of typhoid broke out in the school, and\r\nthree weeks later in the penitentiary. An unexpected freak, however, was\r\nthe appearance of fifteen or twenty cases in another state institution\r\nfarther down on the same stream, which did not draw its water-supply\r\nfrom the flume, but from deep wells of tested purity. This was a puzzle,\r\nuntil it was found that, owing to a fall in the wells, the water from\r\nthe flume had been used for sprinkling and washing purposes in the\r\ninstitution, being allowed to run through the water-pipes only at night,\r\nwhile the well-water was used in the daytime. This was enough to\r\ncontaminate the pipes, and a small epidemic began, which promptly\r\nstopped as soon as the cause was suspected and the flume-water no longer\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThis last instance is peculiarly interesting, as illustrating how\r\ntyphoid infection gets into milk, the second--though at a long\r\ninterval--most frequent means of its spread. It does not come from the\r\ncow, for, fortunately, none of the domestic animals, with the possible\r\nexception of the cat, is subject to typhoid. Nor is it possible that\r\ncattle, drinking foul and even infected water, can transmit the bacillus\r\nin their milk. That superstition was exploded long ago. Every epidemic\r\nof typhoid spread by milk--and there are scores of them now on\r\nrecord--can be traced to the handling of the milk by persons suffering\r\nfrom mild forms of typhoid, or engaged in waiting upon members of the\r\nfamily who are ill of the disease, or the dilution of milk with infected\r\nwater, or even, almost incredible as it may seem, to such slight\r\ncontamination as washing the cans with infected water.\r\n\r\nHealth officers now watch like hawks for the appearance of any case of\r\ntyphoid among or in the families of dairymen. The New York City Board of\r\nHealth, for instance, requires the weekly filing of a certificate from\r\nthe family physician of all dairymen that no such cases exist. And the\r\nmore intelligent dairymen keep a vigilant eye upon any appearance of\r\nillness accompanied by fever among their employees, some that I have\r\nknown even keeping a fever thermometer in the barn for the purpose of\r\ntesting every suspicious case. How effective such precautions can be\r\nmade may be illustrated by the fact that, in the past five years, there\r\nhas not been a single epidemic of typhoid traceable to milk in Greater\r\nNew York, even with its inadequate corps of ten inspectors, and the six\r\nstates they have to cover. The moment a single case of typhoid appears,\r\nthe dairy or milkman supplying that customer is given a most rigid\r\nspecial inspection, and, if any source of infection can be discovered,\r\nthe milk is shut out of New York City until the department is satisfied\r\nthat all danger has been removed. One or two lessons of this sort are\r\nenough for a whole county of dairymen. The danger of transmission of\r\ntyphoid through milk has been enormously exaggerated, and, as in the\r\ncase of all other milk-borne diseases, is entirely due to filthy\r\nhandling, and may be prevented by intelligent sanitary policing. Even\r\nwith our present exceedingly imperfect systems, probably not more than\r\nbetween five and ten per cent of typhoid is transmitted in this way;\r\nand, if the water-supply were kept clean, this would practically\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nTyphoid may not only be transmitted from the earth beneath and the water\r\nunder the earth, but also from the heavens above, through the medium of\r\nflies and dust. The first method is bulking larger every day, especially\r\nin country districts and in camps. The _modus operandi_ is simplicity\r\nitself. The fly lives and moves and has its being in dirt. It breeds in\r\ndirt and it feeds on food, and, as it never wipes its feet, the\r\ninteresting results can be imagined. Just to dispel any possible doubt,\r\nplates of gelatine have been exposed where flies could walk on them,\r\nthen placed in an incubator, and within forty-eight hours there was a\r\nclearly recorded track of the footprints of the flies written in clumps\r\nof bacilli sown by their filthy feet. More definitely, flies have been\r\ncaught in the houses of typhoid patients, put under the microscope, and\r\ntheir feet, stomachs, and specks found swarming with typhoid bacilli. A\r\nsingle flyspeck may contain three thousand.\r\n\r\nFortunately, we have a simple and effective remedy. We cannot disinfect\r\nthe fly nor make him wipe his feet, but we _can_ exterminate him\r\nutterly! This sounds difficult, but it isn't. Like the mosquito, the fly\r\ncan only breed in one particular kind of place, and that place is a heap\r\nof dirt, preferably horse manure, but, at a pinch, dust-bins,\r\ngarbage-cans, sweepings under porches or behind furniture,\r\nvaults,--anywhere that dirt is allowed to remain undisturbed for more\r\nthan a week at a stretch. Abolish, screen, or poison these dirt\r\naccumulations, and flies will disappear, and with them not merely risks\r\nfrom typhoid, but half a dozen other diseases, as well as all sorts of\r\nfilth and much discomfort and inconvenience. It was largely through\r\nflies that the disgraceful epidemic of typhoid, which ravaged our camps\r\non our own soil during the Spanish-American War and killed many times\r\nmore than fell by Spanish bullets, was spread.\r\n\r\nIt is also believed that typhoid bacilli may be carried in the infected\r\ndust of streets and camps. Here again we are dealing with a dangerous\r\npublic enemy to both health and comfort, which can and ought to be\r\nabated by cleanliness, oilings, and sprinklings. Typhoid bacilli are\r\nalso occasionally carried by shellfish, especially oysters, on account\r\nof the interesting modern custom of planting them in bays and harbors\r\nnear the mouths of sewers to fatten them. The cheerful motto of the\r\noysterman is, \"The muddier the water the fatter the oyster.\" And nowhere\r\ndo the bivalves plump up more quickly than near the mouth of a sewer.\r\n\r\nThe last method of transmission is by direct contact with the sick. This\r\nis a relatively rare means of spread, so much so that it is generally\r\nstated that typhoid is not contagious; but it is a real source of danger\r\nand one against which precautions should by all means be taken. The only\r\nmethod is, of course, by the soiling of the hands of the nurse or other\r\nattendant, and then eating or touching food, or putting the fingers into\r\nthe mouth before thoroughly cleansing. If the hands be washed with a\r\nstrong antiseptic solution after waiting upon the patient, and the\r\ncheerful habit sometimes indulged in of putting fruit or other\r\ndelicacies into the sick-room for a day or so, in the hope that they may\r\ntempt the appetite of the patient, and then taking them out and letting\r\nthe children eat them as a treat, be abolished, and the nurse be not\r\nallowed to officiate in the kitchen, risk from this source will be done\r\naway with.\r\n\r\nWhen the bacillus has been introduced into the stomach through food or\r\ndrink, it rapidly proceeds to diffuse itself throughout the tissues of\r\nthe body. Because the most striking symptoms of the disease are\r\ndiarrh[oe]a, abdominal distention, and pain, and the most striking\r\nlesions after death ulcers in the small intestine, it was supposed that\r\nthe process was confined to the abdominal organs. This is now known to\r\nbe an error, as cultures and examinations made from the blood and\r\nvarious parts of the body have shown the presence of the typhoid\r\nbacillus in almost every organ and tissue. This process of scattering,\r\nor invasion of the body, takes from three to ten days to accomplish; and\r\nthe first sign of trouble is usually a feeling of depression, with\r\nheadache, and perhaps slight nausea, before any characteristic bowel\r\nsymptoms begin to show themselves.\r\n\r\nThe general invasion of the system throws an interesting sidelight upon\r\nthe subject of premonitions. There are several well authenticated cases\r\non record where individuals just before coming down with typhoid have\r\nbeen strangely impressed with a sense of impending death, and have even\r\ngone so far as to make their wills and set their affairs in order.\r\nBecause these strong impressions appeared before any clearly marked\r\nintestinal symptoms of the disease, they have been put down in popular\r\nliterature as instances of the \"second sight,\" or \"sixth sense,\" which\r\npopular superstition believes many of us to possess under certain\r\ncircumstances. Now, however, we know that the tissues of that individual\r\nwere already swarming with bacilli, and his fear of impending death was\r\nsimply the effect of his toxin-laden blood upon his brain centres. In\r\nother words, it was prophecy after the fact, like nearly all prophecies\r\nthat happen to come true; and the \"premonition\" was an early symptom of\r\nthe disease itself.\r\n\r\nAs it is, of course, difficult to fix the precise drink of water or\r\nmouthful of food in which the infection was conveyed, we were for a long\r\ntime in doubt as to the length of time which it took to spread through\r\nthe system,--the \"period of incubation,\" as it is termed,--although we\r\nknew in a general way that it averaged somewhere about ten days. But,\r\nabout a year ago, fortune was kind to us. A nurse in one of the Parisian\r\nhospitals, in a fit of despondency, decided to commit suicide. Like a\r\ntrue Parisienne, she would be nothing if not up to date, and chose, as\r\nthe most _recherché_ and original method of departing this life, to\r\nswallow a pure culture of typhoid germs, which she abstracted from the\r\nlaboratory. Three days later she began to complain of headache, and\r\nwithin a week had developed a beautiful crop of symptoms, and a typical\r\ncase of typhoid, from which, under modern treatment, she promptly\r\nrecovered,--a wiser and, we trust, a happier woman.\r\n\r\nBy just what avenue the infecting bacilli go from the stomach into the\r\ngeneral system we do not know. Metschnikoff suggests that they can only\r\npenetrate the intestinal wall through wounds or abrasions of the mucous\r\nmembrane, made by intestinal worms or other parasites. Certain it is\r\nthat the average stomach has a considerable degree of resisting power\r\nagainst them, for in no known civil epidemic has the number of those who\r\ncaught the disease exceeded ten per cent of the total number drinking\r\nthe infected water or milk. In one or two camps in time of war the\r\npercentage has risen as high as eighteen or twenty per cent of those\r\nexposed, but this is exceptional. However, now that we know that\r\nintestinal symptoms do not constitute the entire disease, and may even\r\nbe entirely absent, we strongly suspect that many cases of slight\r\ndepression, with feverishness, loss of appetite, and disturbances of the\r\ndigestion, which occur during an epidemic, may really have been very\r\nmild cases of the disease.\r\n\r\nOne of the singular features of the disease is that, unlike many other\r\ninfections, we are entirely unable to say what conditions or influences\r\nseem either to protect against it or to predispose toward it. In the\r\ndays when we believed it to be an exclusively intestinal disease it was\r\nnaturally supposed that chronic digestive disturbances, and especially\r\nacute attacks of bowel trouble or dysentery, would predispose to it, but\r\nthis has been entirely disproved. Soldiers in barracks with chronic\r\ndigestive disturbances, and even with dysentery, have shown no higher\r\npercentage of typhoid during an epidemic than others. Nor does it seem\r\nmuch more likely to occur in those who are constitutionally weak, or run\r\ndown, or overworked, as some of the most violent and unmanageable cases\r\noccur in vigorous men and women, who were previously in perfect health.\r\nSo that, although we have unquestionably a high degree of resistance\r\nagainst it, since not more than one in ten exposed contracts it, and\r\nonly one in ten of those who contract it dies, we have not the least\r\nidea in what direction, so to speak, to build up our resisting powers in\r\norder to increase them.\r\n\r\nThe best remedy is to destroy the disease altogether, and this could be\r\ndone in five years by intelligent concerted effort. It was at one time\r\nsupposed that typhoid fever was a disease exclusively confined to adult\r\nlife; but it is now known to occur frequently in children, though often\r\nin such a mild and irregular form as to escape recognition. Something\r\nlike seventy per cent of all cases occur between the fifteenth and the\r\nfortieth year, and it is, for some reason, though rarer, peculiarly\r\nserious and more often fatal after the fiftieth year.\r\n\r\nWhen once the outer wall has been pierced, the sack of the city rapidly\r\nproceeds. The bacilli multiply everywhere, but seem for some reason to\r\nfocalize chiefly in the alimentary canal, and especially the middle part\r\nof it, the small intestines. After headache, backache, and loss of\r\nappetite comes usually a mild diarrh[oe]a. This diarrh[oe]a is due to an\r\nattack of the bacillus or its toxins upon certain clumps of lymphoid\r\ntissue in the wall of the small intestine, known as the \"patches of\r\nPeyer.\" This produces inflammation, followed by ulceration, which in\r\nsevere cases may eat through the wall of a blood-vessel, causing profuse\r\nhemorrhages, or even perforate the bowel wall and set up a fatal\r\nperitonitis. The temperature begins to swing from two to five degrees\r\nabove the normal level, following the usual daily vibration, and ranging\r\nfrom 100 degrees to 101 degrees in the morning up to 102 degrees to 105\r\ndegrees in the afternoon. The face becomes flushed.\r\n\r\nThere is usually comparatively little pain, and the patient lies in a\r\nsort of mild stupor, paying little attention to his surroundings. He is\r\nmuch enfeebled and seldom cares to lift his head from the pillow. A\r\nslight rash appears upon the surface of the body, but this is so faint\r\nthat it would escape attention unless carefully looked for. Little\r\ngroups of vesicles, containing clear fluid, appear upon the chest and\r\nabdomen. If one of these faint rose-colored spots be pricked with a\r\nneedle and a drop of blood be drawn, typhoid bacilli will often be found\r\nin it, and they will also be present in the clear fluid of the tiny\r\nsweat blisters.\r\n\r\nThis condition will last for from ten days to four weeks, the patient\r\ngradually becoming weaker and more apathetic, and the temperature\r\nmaintaining an afternoon level of 102 to 104 degrees. Then, in the vast\r\nmajority of cases, a little decline of the temperature will be noticed.\r\nThe patient begins to take a slight interest in his surroundings. He\r\nwill perhaps ask for something to drink, or something to eat, instead of\r\napathetically swallowing what is offered to him. Next day the\r\ntemperature is a little lower still, and within a week, perhaps, will\r\nhave returned to the normal level. The patient has lost from twenty to\r\nforty pounds, is weak as a kitten, and it may be ten days after the\r\nfever has disappeared before he asks to sit up in bed.\r\n\r\nThen follows the period of return to health. The patient becomes a\r\nwalking appetite, and, after weeks of liquid diet, will beg like a\r\nspoiled child for cookies or hard apples or pie, or something that he\r\ncan set his teeth into. But his tissues are still swarming with the\r\nbacilli, and any indiscretion, either of diet, exposure, or exertion, at\r\nthis time, may result in forming a secondary colony, or abscess,\r\nsomewhere in the lungs, the liver, or the muscles. He must be kept quiet\r\nand warm, and abundantly, but judiciously, fed, for at least three\r\nweeks after the disappearance of the fever, if he wishes to avoid the\r\nthousand and one ambuscades set by the retreating enemy.\r\n\r\nNow, what has happened when recovery begins? One would suppose that\r\neither the bacilli had poisoned themselves, exhausted the supplies of\r\nnourishment in the body of the patient, so that the fever had \"burnt\r\nitself out,\" as we used to say, or that the tissues had rallied from the\r\nattack and destroyed or thrown out the invaders. But, on the contrary,\r\nwe find that our convalescent patient, even after he is up and walking\r\nabout, is still full of the bacilli.\r\n\r\nTo put it very crudely, what has really happened is that the body has\r\nsucceeded in forming such antidotes against the poison of the bacilli\r\nthat, although they may be present in enormous numbers, they can no\r\nlonger produce any injurious effect. In other words, it has acquired\r\nimmunity against this particular germ and its toxin. In fact, one of our\r\nnewest and most reliable tests for the disease consists in a curious\r\n\"clumping\" or paralyzing power over cultures of the _Bacillus typhosus_,\r\nshown by a drop of the patient's blood, even as early as the seventh or\r\neighth day of the illness. And, while it is an immensely difficult and\r\ncomplicated subject, we are justified in saying that this immunity is\r\nnot merely a substance formed in the body, the stock of which will\r\nshortly become exhausted, but a faculty acquired by the body-cells,\r\nwhich they will retain, like other results of education, for years, and\r\neven for life. When once the body has learned the wrestling trick of\r\nthrowing and vanquishing a particular germ or bacillus, it no longer\r\nhas much to dread from that germ. This is why the same individual is\r\nseldom attacked the second time by scarlet fever, measles, typhoid, and\r\nsmallpox.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the individual may be entirely immune to the germs of a\r\ngiven disease, he may carry them in his body in enormous numbers, and\r\ninfect others while escaping himself.\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly true of typhoid, and we are beginning to extend our\r\nsanitary care over recovered patients, not merely to the end of acute\r\nillness, but for the period of at least a month after they have\r\napparently recovered. Several most disquieting cases are on record of\r\nso-called \"typhoid carriers,\" or individuals who, having recovered from\r\nthe disease itself, carried and spread the infection wherever they went\r\nfor months and even years afterward. This, however, is probably a rare\r\nstate of affairs, though a recent German health bulletin reports the\r\ndiscovery of some twenty cases during the past year. The lair of the\r\nbacilli is believed to be the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\nAs to treatment, it may be broadly stated that all authorities and\r\nschools are for once practically agreed:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that we have no known specific drug for the cure of the disease.\r\n\r\nSecond, that we are content to take a leaf out of nature's book, and\r\nfollow--so to speak--her instinctive methods: first of all, by putting\r\nthe patient to bed the moment that a reasonable suspicion of the disease\r\nis formed; this conserves his strength, and greatly diminishes the\r\ndanger of serious complications; cases of \"walking typhoid\" have among\r\nthe highest death-rates; second, by meeting the great instinctive\r\nsymptom of fever patients since the world began, thirst, encouraging the\r\npatient to drink large quantities of water, taking care, of course, that\r\nthe water is pure and sterile. The days when we kept fever patients\r\nwrapped up to their necks in woolen blankets in hot, stuffy rooms, and\r\nrigorously limited the amount of water that they drank--in other words,\r\nfought against nature in the treatment of disease--have passed. A\r\ntyphoid-fever patient now is not only given all he wants to drink, but\r\nencouraged to take more, and some authorities recommend an intake of at\r\nleast three or four quarts, and, better, six and eight quarts a day.\r\nThis internal bath helps not only to allay the temperature, but to make\r\ngood the enormous loss by perspiration from the fevered skin, and to\r\nflush the toxins out of the body.\r\n\r\nThird, by liberal and regular feeding chiefly with some liquid or\r\nsemi-liquid food, of which milk is the commonest form. The old attitude\r\nof mind represented by the proverb, \"Feed a cold and starve a fever,\"\r\nhas completely disappeared. One of the fathers of modern medicine asked\r\non his death-bed, thirty years ago, that his epitaph should be, \"He fed\r\nfevers.\"\r\n\r\nFourth. We respond to the other great thirst of fever patients, for\r\ncoolness, by sponge baths and tub baths, whenever the temperature rises\r\nabove a certain degree.\r\n\r\nSimple as these methods sound, they are extremely troublesome to put\r\ninto execution, and require the greatest skill and judgment in their\r\ncarrying out. But intelligent persistence in the careful elaboration of\r\nthese methods of nature has resulted in already cutting the death-rate\r\nin two,--from fifteen or twenty per cent to less than ten per cent,--and\r\nwhere the full rigor of the tub bath is carried out it has been brought\r\ndown to as low as five per cent.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the bacteriologists are steadily at work on a vaccine or\r\nantitoxin. Wright, of the English Army Medical Staff, has already\r\nsecured a serum, which has given remarkable results in protecting\r\nregiments sent out to South Africa and other infected regions.\r\nChantemesse has imported some six hundred successive cases treated with\r\nan antitoxin, whose mortality was only about a third of the ordinary\r\nhospital rate, and the future is full of promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDIPHTHERIA\r\n\r\n\r\nThat was a dark and stern saying, \"Without the shedding of blood there\r\nis no remission,\" and, like all the words of the oracles, of limited\r\napplication. But it proves true in some unexpected places outside of the\r\nrealm of theology. Was there something prophetic in the legend that it\r\nwas only by the sprinkling of the blood of the Paschal Lamb above the\r\ndoorway that the plague of the firstborn could be stayed? To-day the\r\nguinea-pig is our burnt offering against a plague as deadly as any sent\r\ninto Egypt.\r\n\r\nScarcely more than a decade ago, as the mother sat by the cradle of her\r\nfirstborn, musing over his future, one moment fearfully reckoning the\r\ngauntlet of risks that his tiny life had to run, and the next building\r\nrosy air-castles of his happiness and success, there was one shadow that\r\never fell black and sinister across his tiny horoscope. Certain risks\r\nthere were which were almost inevitable,--initiation ceremonies into\r\nlife, mild expiations to be paid to the gods of the modern underworld,\r\nthe diseases of infancy and of childhood. Most of these could be passed\r\nover with little more than a temporary wrinkle to break her smile. They\r\nwere so trivial, so comparatively harmless: measles, a mere reddening of\r\nthe eyelids and peppering of the throat, with a headache and purplish\r\nrash, dangerous only if neglected; chicken-pox, a child's-play at\r\ndisease; scarlatina, a little more serious, but still with the chances\r\nof twenty to one in favor of recovery; diphtheria--ah! that drove the\r\nsmile from her face and the blood from her lips. Not quite so common,\r\nnot so inevitable as a prospect, but, as a possibility, full of terror,\r\nonce its poison had passed the gates of the body fortress. The fight\r\nbetween the Angel of Life and the Angel of Death was waged on almost\r\nequal terms, with none daring to say which would be the victor, and none\r\nable to lift a hand with any certainty to aid.\r\n\r\nNor was the doctor in much happier plight. Even when the life at stake\r\nwas not one of his own loved ones,--though from the deadly\r\ncontagiousness of the disease it sadly often was (I have known more\r\ndoctors made childless by diphtheria than by any other disease except\r\ntuberculosis),--he faced his cases by the hundred instead of by twos and\r\nthrees. The feeling of helplessness, the sense of foreboding, with which\r\nwe faced every case was something appalling. Few of us who have been in\r\npractice twenty years or more, or even fifteen, will ever forget the\r\nshock of dismay which ran through us whenever a case to which we had\r\nbeen summoned revealed itself to be diphtheria. Of course, there was a\r\nfighting chance, and we made the most of it; for in the milder epidemics\r\nonly ten to twenty per cent of the patients died, and even in the\r\nseverest a third of them recovered. But what \"turned our liver to\r\nwater\"--as the graphic Oriental phrase has it--was the knowledge which,\r\nlike Banquo's ghost, would not down, that while many cases would recover\r\nof themselves, and in many border-line ones our skill would turn the\r\nbalance in favor of recovery, yet if the disease happened to take a\r\ncertain sadly familiar, virulent form we could do little more to stay\r\nits fatal course than we could to stop an avalanche, and we never knew\r\nwhen a particular epidemic or a particular case would take that turn.\r\n\"Black\" diphtheria was as deadly as the Black Death of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe disease which caused all this terror and havoc is of singular\r\ncharacter and history. It is not a modern invention or development, as\r\nis sometimes believed, for descriptions are on record of so-called\r\n\"Egyptian ulcer of the throat\" in the earliest centuries of our era; and\r\nit would appear to have been recognized by both Hippocrates and Galen.\r\nEpidemics of it also occurred in the Middle Ages; and, coming to more\r\nrecent times, one of the many enemies which the Pilgrim Fathers had to\r\nfight was a series of epidemics of this \"black sore throat,\" of\r\nparticularly malignant character, in the seventeenth century.\r\nNevertheless, it does not seem to have become sufficiently common to be\r\ndistinctly recognized until it was named as a definite disease, and\r\ngiven the title which it now bears, by the celebrated French physician,\r\nBretonneau, about eighty years ago. Since then it has become either more\r\nwidely recognized or steadily more prevalent, and it is the general\r\nopinion of pathologists that the disease, up to some thirty or forty\r\nyears ago, was steadily increasing, both in frequency and in severity.\r\n\r\nSo that we have not to deal with a disease which, like the other\r\nso-called diseases of childhood, has gradually become milder and milder\r\nby a sort of racial vaccination, with survival of the less susceptible,\r\nbut one which is still full of virulence and of possibilities of future\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nUnlike the other diseases of childhood, also, one attack confers no\r\npositive immunity for the future, although it greatly diminishes the\r\nprobabilities; and, further, while adults do not readily or frequently\r\ncatch the disease, yet when they do the results are apt to be\r\nexceedingly serious. Indeed, we have practically come to the conclusion\r\nthat one of the main reasons why adults do not develop diphtheria so\r\nfrequently as children, is that they are not brought into such close and\r\nintimate contact with other children, nor are they in the habit of\r\npromptly and indiscriminately hugging and kissing every one who happens\r\nto attract their transient affection, and they have outgrown that\r\ncheerful spirit of comradeship which leads to the sharing of candy in\r\nalternate sucks, and the passing on of slate-pencils, chewing-gum, and\r\nother _objets d'art_ from hand to hand, and from mouth to mouth.\r\nStatistics show that of nurses employed in diphtheria wards, before the\r\ncause or the exact method of contagion was clearly understood, nearly\r\nthirty per cent developed the disease; and even with every modern\r\nprecaution there are few diseases which doctors more frequently catch\r\nfrom their patients than diphtheria. It is a significant fact that the\r\nrisk of developing diphtheria is greatest precisely at the ages when\r\nthere is not the slightest scruple about putting everything that may be\r\npicked up into the mouth,--namely, from the second to the fifth\r\nyear,--and diminishes steadily as habits of cleanliness and caution in\r\nthis regard are developed, even though no immunity may have been gained\r\nby a mild or slight attack of the disease. The tendency to discourage\r\nand forbid the indiscriminate kissing of children, and the crusade\r\nagainst the uses of the mouth as a pencil-holder, pincushion, and\r\ngeneral receptacle for odds and ends, would be thoroughly justified by\r\nthe risks from diphtheria alone, to say nothing of tuberculosis and\r\nother infections.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being almost the only common disease of childhood which\r\nis not mild and becoming milder, diphtheria is unique in another\r\nrespect, and that is its point of attack. Just as tuberculosis seizes\r\nits victims by the lungs, and typhoid fever by the bowels,\r\ndiphtheria--like the weasel--grips at the throat. Its bacilli, entering\r\nthrough the mouth and gaining a foothold first upon the tonsils, the\r\npalate, or back of the throat (pharynx), multiply and spread until they\r\nswarm down into the larynx and windpipe, where their millions, swarming\r\nin the mesh of fibrin poured out by the outraged blood-vessels, grow\r\ninto the deadly false membrane which fills the air-tube and slowly\r\nstrangles its victim to death.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of a death like that can never fade from the memory of one\r\nwho has once seen it, and will outweigh the lives of a thousand\r\nguinea-pigs. No wonder there was such a widespread and peculiar horror\r\nof the disease, as of some ghostly thug or strangler.\r\n\r\nBut not all of the dread of diphtheria went under its own name. Most of\r\nus can still remember when the commonest occupant of the nursery shelf\r\nwas the bottle of ipecac or soothing-syrup as a specific against croup.\r\nThe thing that most often kept the mother or nurse of young children\r\nawake and listening through the night-watches was the sound of a cough,\r\nand the anxious waiting to hear whether the next explosion had a\r\n\"croupy\" or brassy sound. It was, of course, early recognized that there\r\nwere two kinds of croup, the so-called \"spasmodic\" and the \"membranous,\"\r\nthe former comparatively common and correspondingly harmless, the latter\r\none of the deadliest of known diseases. The fear that made the mother's\r\nheart leap into her mouth as she heard the ringing croup-cough was lest\r\nit might be membranous, or, if spasmodic, might turn into the deadly\r\nform later. To-day most young mothers hardly know the name of wine of\r\nipecac or alum, and the coughs of young children awaken little more\r\nterror than a similar sound in an adult. Croup has almost ceased to be\r\none of the bogies of the nursery. And why? Because membranous croup has\r\nbeen discovered to be diphtheria, and children will not develop\r\ndiphtheria unless they have been exposed to the contagion, while, if\r\nthey should be, we have a remedy against it.\r\n\r\nHe was a bold man who first ventured to announce this, and for years the\r\nbattle raged hotly. It was early admitted that certain cases of\r\nso-called membranous croup in children occurred after or while other\r\nmembers of the family or household had diphtheria; and for a time the\r\nopposing camps used such words as \"sporadic\" or scattered croup, which\r\nwas supposed to come of itself, and \"epidemic\" or contagious croup,\r\nwhich was diphtheria. Now, however, these distinctions are swept away,\r\nand boards of health require isolation and quarantine against croup\r\nexactly as against any other form of diphtheria.\r\n\r\nCases of fatal croup still occasionally occur which cannot be directly\r\ntraced to other cases of diphtheria, but the vast majority of them are\r\nclearly traceable to infection, usually from some case in another child,\r\nwhich was so mild that it was not recognized as diphtheria until the\r\nbaby became \"croupy\" and search was made through the family throats for\r\nthe bacilli.\r\n\r\nFor years we were in doubt as to the cause of diphtheria. Half a dozen\r\ndifferent theories were advanced, bad sewerage, foul air, overcrowding;\r\nbut it was not until shortly after the Columbus-like discovery, by\r\nRobert Koch, of the new continent of bacteriology, that the germ which\r\ncaused it was arrested, tried, and found guilty, and our real knowledge\r\nof and control over the disease began. This was in 1883, when the\r\nbacteriologist Klebs discovered the organism, followed a few months\r\nlater (in 1884) by Löffler, who made valuable additions to our knowledge\r\nof it; so that it has ever since been known as the Klebs-Löffler\r\nbacillus. This put us upon solid ground, and our progress was both sure\r\nand rapid: in ten years our knowledge of the causation, the method of\r\nspread, the mode of assault upon the body-fortress, and last, but not\r\nleast, the cure, stood out clear cut as a die, a model and a prophecy of\r\nwhat may be hoped for in most other contagious diseases.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the credit to which bacteriologists are entitled for this\r\nsplendid piece of scientific progress, there was another co-laborer, a\r\nsilent partner, with them in all this triumph, an unsung hero and martyr\r\nof science who deserves his meed of praise--the tiny guinea-pig. He well\r\ndeserves his niche in the temple of fame; and as other races and ages\r\nhave worshiped the elephant, the snake, and the sacred cow, so this age\r\nshould erect its temples to the guinea-pig. From one of the most\r\ntrifling and unimportant,--kept merely as a pet and curiosity by the\r\nsmall boys of all ages,--he has become, after the horse, the cow, the\r\npig, and the sheep, easily our most useful and important domestic\r\nanimal. It may be urged that he deserves no credit, since his\r\nsacrifice--though of inestimable value--was entirely involuntary on his\r\nown part; but this should only make us the more deeply bound to\r\nacknowledge our obligation to him.\r\n\r\nBy a stern necessity of fate, which no one regrets more keenly than the\r\nlaboratory workers themselves, the guinea-pig has had to be used as a\r\nstepping-stone for every inch of this progress. Upon it were conducted\r\nevery one of the experiments whose results widened our knowledge, until\r\nwe found that this bacillus and no other would cause diphtheria; that\r\ninstead of getting, like many other disease-germs, into the blood, it\r\nchiefly limited itself to growing and multiplying upon a comparatively\r\nsmall patch of the body-surface, most commonly of the throat; that most\r\nof its serious and fatal results upon the body were produced, not by the\r\nentrance of the germs themselves into the blood, but by the absorption\r\nof the toxins or poisons produced by them on the moist surface of the\r\nthroat, just as the yeast plant will produce alcohol in grape juice or\r\nsweet cider.\r\n\r\nHere was a most important clew. It was not necessary to fight the germs\r\nthemselves in every part of the body, but merely to introduce some\r\nferment or chemical substance which would have the power of neutralizing\r\ntheir poison. Instantly attention was turned in this direction, and it\r\nwas quickly found that if a guinea-pig were injected with a very small\r\ndose of the diphtheria toxin and allowed to recover, he would then be\r\nable to throw off a still larger dose, until finally, after a number of\r\nweeks, he could be given a dose which would have promptly killed him in\r\nthe beginning of the experiments, but which he now readily resisted and\r\nrecovered from. Evidently some substance was produced in his blood which\r\nwas a natural antidote for the toxin, and a little further search\r\nquickly resulted in discovering and filtering out of his body the now\r\nfamous antitoxin. A dose of this injected into another guinea-pig\r\nsuffering from diphtheria would promptly save its life.\r\n\r\nCould this antitoxin be obtained in sufficient amounts to protect the\r\nbody of a human being? The guinea-pig was so tiny and the process of\r\nantitoxin-forming so slow, that we naturally turned to larger animals as\r\na possible source, and here it was quickly found that not only would the\r\ngoat and the horse develop this antidote substance very quickly and in\r\nlarge amounts, but that a certain amount of it, or a substance acting as\r\nan antitoxin, was present in their blood to begin with. Of the two, the\r\nhorse was found to give both the stronger antitoxin and the larger\r\namounts of it, so that he is now exclusively used for its production.\r\n\r\nAfter his resisting power had been raised to the highest possible pitch\r\nby successive injections of increasing doses of the toxin, and his serum\r\n(the watery part of the blood which contains the healing body) had been\r\nused hundreds and hundreds of times to save the lives of\r\ndiphtheria-stricken guinea-pigs, and had been shown over and over again\r\nto be not merely magically curative but absolutely harmless, it was\r\ntried with fear and trembling upon a gasping, struggling, suffocating\r\nchild, as a last possible resort to save a life otherwise hopelessly\r\ndoomed. Who could tell whether the \"heal-serum,\" as the Germans call it,\r\nwould act in a human being as it had upon all the other animals? In\r\nagonies of suspense, vibrating between hope and dread, doctors and\r\nparents hung over the couch. What was their delight, within a few hours,\r\nto see the muscles of the little one begin to relax, the fatal blueness\r\nof its lips to diminish, and its breathing become easier. In a few hours\r\nmore the color had returned to the ashen face and it was breathing\r\nquietly. Then it began to cough and to bring up pieces of the loosened\r\nmembrane that had been strangling it. Another dose was eagerly injected,\r\nand within twenty-four hours the child was sleeping peacefully--out of\r\ndanger. And the most priceless and marvelous life-saving weapon of the\r\ncentury had been placed in the hand of the physician.\r\n\r\nOf course there were many disappointments and failures in the earlier\r\ncases. Our first antitoxins were too weak and too variable. We were\r\nafraid to use them in sufficient doses. Often their injection would not\r\nbe consented to until the case had become hopeless. But courage and\r\nindustry have conquered these difficulties one after another, until now\r\nthe fact that the prompt and intelligent use of antitoxin will effect a\r\ncure of from ninety to ninety-five per cent of all cases of diphtheria\r\nis as thoroughly established as any other fact in medicine. The mass of\r\nfigures from all parts of the world in support of its value has become\r\nso overwhelming that it is neither possible nor necessary to specify\r\nthem in detail. The series of Bayeaux, covering two hundred and thirty\r\nthousand cases of diphtheria, chiefly from hospitals and hence of the\r\nseverest type, showing that the death-rate had been reduced from over\r\n_fifty-five_ per cent to below _sixteen_ per cent already, and that this\r\ndecrease was still continuing, will serve as a fair sample.\r\n\r\nThree-quarters of even this sixteen per cent mortality is due to delay\r\nin the administration of the antitoxin, as is vividly shown in thousands\r\nof cases now on record, classified according to the day of the disease\r\non which the antitoxin was given, of which MacCombie's \"Report of the\r\nLondon Asylums Board\" is a fair type. Of one hundred and eighty-seven\r\ncases treated the first day of the disease, none died; of eleven hundred\r\nand eighty-six injected on the second day of the disease, four and a\r\nhalf per cent died; of twelve hundred and thirty-three not treated until\r\nthe third day of the disease, eleven per cent died; of nine hundred and\r\nsixty-three cases escaping treatment until the fourth day, seventeen per\r\ncent died; while of twelve hundred and sixty not seen until the fifth\r\nday, twenty per cent died. In other words, the chances for cure by the\r\nantitoxin are in precise proportion to the earliness with which it is\r\nadministered, and are over four times as great during the first two days\r\nof the disease as they are after the fourth day. One \"stick\" in time\r\nsaves five.\r\n\r\nThis brings us sharply to the fact that the most important factor in the\r\ncure of diphtheria, just as in the case of tuberculosis, is early\r\nrecognition. How can this be secured? Here again the bacteriologist\r\ncomes to our relief, and we needed his aid badly. The symptoms of a mild\r\ncase of diphtheria for the first two, or even three, days are very much\r\nlike those of an ordinary sore throat. As a rule, even the well-known\r\nmembrane does not appear in sufficient amounts to be recognizable by the\r\nnaked eye until the middle of the second, or sometimes even of the\r\nthird, day. By any ordinary means, then, of diagnosis, we would often be\r\nin doubt as to whether a case were diphtheria or not, until it was both\r\nwell advanced and had had time to infect other members of the family.\r\nWith the help of the laboratory, however, we have a prompt, positive,\r\nand simple method of deciding at the very earliest stage. We merely take\r\na sterilized swab of cotton on the end of a wire, rub it gently over the\r\nsurface of the throat and tonsils, restore it to its glass tube,\r\nsmearing it over the surface of some solidified blood-serum placed at\r\nthe bottom of the tube, close the tube and send it to the nearest\r\nlaboratory. The culture is put into an incubator at body heat, the germs\r\nsown upon the surface of the blood-serum grow and multiply, and in\r\ntwelve hours a positive diagnosis can be made by examining this growth\r\nwith a microscope. Often, just smearing the mucus swabbed out of the\r\nthroat over the surface of a glass slide, staining this smear, and\r\nputting it under a microscope, will enable us to decide within an hour.\r\nThese tubes are now provided by all progressive city boards of health,\r\nand can be had free of charge at depots scattered all over the city, for\r\nuse in any doubtful case, within half an hour. Twelve hours later a free\r\nreport can be had from the public laboratory. If every case of\r\nsuspicious sore throat in a child were promptly swabbed out, and a smear\r\nfrom the swab examined at a laboratory, it would not be long before\r\ndiphtheria would be practically exterminated, as smallpox has been by\r\nvaccination, and this is what we are working toward and looking forward\r\nto.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the precise cause of diphtheria, the Klebs-Löffler\r\nbacillus, has furnished us not only with the cure, but also with the\r\nmeans of preventing its spread. While under certain circumstances,\r\nparticularly the presence of moisture and the absence of light, this\r\ngerm may live and remain virulent for weeks outside of the body, careful\r\nstudy of its behavior under all sorts of conditions has revealed the\r\nconsoling fact that its vitality outside of the human or some other\r\nliving animal body is low; so that it is relatively seldom carried from\r\none case to another by articles of clothing, books, or toys, and\r\ncomparatively seldom even through a third party, except where the latter\r\nhas come into very close contact with the disease, like a doctor, a\r\nnurse, or a mother, or--without disrespect to the preceding--a pet cat\r\nor dog.\r\n\r\nMore than this, the bacillus must chiefly be transmitted in the moist\r\ncondition and does not float in the air at all, clinging only to such\r\nobjects as may have become smeared with the mucus from the child's\r\nthroat, as by being coughed or sneezed upon. As with most of our\r\ngerm-enemies, sunlight is its deadliest foe, and it will not live more\r\nthan two or three days exposed to sunshine. So the principal danger\r\nagainst which we must be on our guard is that of direct personal\r\ncontact, as in kissing, in the use of spoons or cups in common, in the\r\ninterchange of candy or pencils, or through having the hands or clothing\r\nsprayed by a cough or a sneeze.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus comparatively seldom even gets on the floor or walls of a\r\nroom where reasonable precautions against coughing and spitting have\r\nbeen taken; but it is, of course, advisable thoroughly to disinfect and\r\nsterilize the room of a patient and all its contents with corrosive\r\nsublimate and formalin, as a number of cases are on record in which the\r\ndisease has been carried through books and articles of clothing which\r\nhad been kept in damp, dark places for several months. The chief method\r\nof spread is through unrecognized mild cases of the disease, especially\r\nof the nasal form. For this reason boards of health now always insist\r\nupon smears being made from the throats and noses of every other child\r\nin the family or house where a case of diphtheria is recognized. No\r\nsmall percentages of these are found to be suffering from a mild form of\r\nthe disease, so slight as to cause them little inconvenience and no\r\ninterference with their attending school. Unfortunately, a case caught\r\nfrom one of these mild forms may develop into the severest laryngeal\r\ntype. If a child is running freely at the nose, keep it at home or keep\r\nyour own child away from it. A profuse nasal discharge is generally\r\ninfectious, in the case of influenza or other \"colds,\" if not of\r\ndiphtheria.\r\n\r\nThis also emphasizes the necessity for a thorough and expert medical\r\ninspection of school-children, to prevent these mild cases from\r\nspreading disease and death to their fellows. By an intelligent\r\ncombination of the two methods, home examination of every infected\r\nfamily and strict school inspection, there is little difficulty in\r\nstamping out promptly a beginning infection before it has had time to\r\nreach the proportions of an epidemic.\r\n\r\nOne other step makes assurance doubly sure, and that is the prompt\r\ninjection of all other children and young adults living in the family,\r\nwhere there is a case of diphtheria, with small doses of the antitoxin\r\nfor preventive purposes. Its value in this respect has been only\r\nsecondary to its use as a cure. There are now thousands of cases on\r\nrecord of children who had been exposed to diphtheria or were in\r\nhospitals where they were in danger of becoming exposed to it, with the\r\ndelightful result that only a very small per cent of those so protected\r\ndeveloped the disease, and of these not a single one died! This\r\nprotective vaccination, however, cannot be used on a large scale, as in\r\nthe case of smallpox, for the reason that the period of protection is a\r\ncomparatively short one, probably not exceeding two or three weeks.\r\n\r\nSuppose that, in spite of all our precautions, the disease has gained a\r\nfoothold in the throat, what will be its course? This will depend, first\r\nof all, upon whether the invading germs have lodged in their commonest\r\npoint of attack, the tonsils, palate, and upper throat, or have\r\npenetrated down the air-passages into the larynx or voice-organ. In the\r\nformer, which is far the commoner case, their presence will cause an\r\nirritation of the surface cells which brings out the leucocyte cavalry\r\nof the body to the defense, together with squads of the serum or watery\r\nfluid of the blood containing fibrin. These, together with the\r\nsurface-cells, are rapidly coagulated and killed by the deadly toxin;\r\nand their remains form a coating upon the surface, which at first is\r\nscarcely perceptible, a thin, grayish film, but which in the course of\r\ntwenty-four to forty-eight hours rapidly thickens to the well-known and\r\ndreaded false membrane. Before, however, it has thickened in more than\r\noccasional spots or patches, the toxin has begun to penetrate into the\r\nblood, and the little patient will complain of headache, feverishness,\r\nand backache, often--indeed, usually--before any very marked soreness in\r\nthe throat is complained of. Roughly speaking, attacks of sore throat,\r\nwhich begin first of all with well-marked soreness and pain in the\r\nthroat, followed later by headache, backache, and fever, are not very\r\nlikely to be diphtheria. The bacilli multiply and increase in their\r\ndeadly mat on the surface of the throat, larger and larger amounts of\r\nthe poison are poured into the blood, the temperature goes up, the\r\nheadache increases, the child often begins to vomit, and becomes\r\nseriously ill. The glands of the neck, in their efforts to arrest and\r\nneutralize the poison, become swollen and sore to the touch, the breath\r\nbecomes foul from the breaking down of the membrane in the throat, the\r\npulse becomes rapid and weak from the effect of the poison upon the\r\nheart, and the dreaded picture of the disease rapidly develops.\r\n\r\nThis process in from sixty to eighty per cent of cases will continue for\r\nfrom three to seven days, when a check will come and the condition will\r\ngradually improve. This is a sign that the defensive tissues of the body\r\nhave succeeded in rallying their forces against the attack, and have\r\npoured out sufficient amounts of their natural antitoxin to neutralize\r\nthe poisons poured in by the invaders. The membrane begins to break down\r\nand peel off the throat, the temperature goes down, the headache\r\ndisappears, the swelling in the glands of the neck may either subside or\r\ngo on to suppuration and rupture, but within another week the child is\r\nfairly on the way to recovery.\r\n\r\nShould the invaders, however, have secured a foothold in the larynx,\r\nthen the picture is sadly different. The child may have even less\r\nheadache, temperature, and general sense of illness; but he begins to\r\ncough, and the cough has a ringing, brassy sound. Within forty-eight, or\r\neven twenty-four, hours he begins to have difficulty in respiration.\r\nThis rapidly increases as the delicate tissues of the larynx swell under\r\nthe attack of the poison, and the very membrane which is created in an\r\nattempt at defense becomes the body's own undoing by increasing the\r\nblocking of the air-passages. The difficulty of breathing becomes\r\ngreater and greater, until the little victim tosses continually from\r\nside to side in one constant, agonizing struggle for breath. After a\r\ntime, however, the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the blood produces\r\nits merciful narcotic effect, and the struggles cease. The breathing\r\nbecomes shallower and shallower, the lips become first blue, then ashy\r\npale, and the little torch of life goes out with a flicker. This was\r\nwhat we had to expect, in spite of our utmost effort, in from seventy to\r\nninety per cent of these laryngeal cases, before the days of the blessed\r\nantitoxin. Now we actually reverse these percentages, prevent the vast\r\nmajority of cases from developing serious laryngeal symptoms at all, and\r\nsave from seventy to eighty per cent of those who do.\r\n\r\nOur only resource in this form of the disease used to be by mechanical\r\nor surgical means, opening the windpipe below the level of the\r\nobstruction and inserting a curved silver tube--the so-called\r\ntracheotomy operation; or later, and less heroic, by pushing forcibly\r\ndown into the larynx, and through and past the obstruction at the vocal\r\ncords, a small metal tube through which the child could manage to\r\nbreathe. This was known as intubation. But these were both distressing\r\nand painful methods, and, what was far worse, pitifully broken reeds to\r\ndepend upon. In spite of the utmost skill of our surgeons, from fifty to\r\neighty per cent of cases that were tracheotomized, and from forty to\r\nsixty per cent of those that were intubated, died. In many cases they\r\nwere enabled to breathe, their attacks of suffocation were relieved--but\r\nstill they died.\r\n\r\nThis leads us to the most important single fact about the course of the\r\ndisease, and that is that the chief source of danger is not so much from\r\ndirect suffocation as from general collapse, and particularly failure of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nThis has given us two other data of great importance and value, namely,\r\nthat while the immediate and greatest peril is over when the membrane\r\nhas become loosened and the temperature has begun to subside, in both\r\nordinary throat and in laryngeal forms of the disease, the patient is by\r\nno means out of danger. While the antitoxins poured out by his body have\r\ncompletely defeated the invading toxins in the open field of the blood,\r\nyet almost every tissue of the body is still saturated with these latter\r\nand has often been seriously damaged by them before their course was\r\nchecked. For instance, nearly two-thirds of our diphtheria cases, which\r\nare properly examined, will show albumin in the urine, showing that the\r\nkidney-cells have been attacked and poisoned by the toxin. This may go\r\non to a fatal attack of uremia; but fortunately, not commonly, far less\r\nso than in scarlet fever. The kidneys usually recover completely, but\r\nthis may take weeks and months. Again, many cases of diphtheria will\r\nshow a weak and rapid pulse, which will persist for weeks after the\r\npatient has apparently recovered; and if the little ones are allowed to\r\nsit up too soon, or to indulge in any sudden movements or muscular\r\nstrains, this weak and rapid pulse will suddenly change into an attack\r\nof heart failure and, possibly, fatal collapse. This, again, illustrates\r\nthe saturation of the poison, as these effects are now known to be due\r\nin part to a direct poisoning of the muscle of the heart itself, and\r\nlater to serious damage done to the nerves controlling the heart,\r\nchiefly the pneumo-gastric. Moral: Keep the little patient in bed for at\r\nleast two weeks or, better, three. He will have to spend a month or more\r\nin quarantine, anyway.\r\n\r\nLast of all, and by no means least interesting, are the effects which\r\nare produced upon the nervous system. One day, while the child is\r\nrecovering, and is possibly beginning to sit up in bed, a glass of milk\r\nis handed to him. The little one drinks it eagerly and attempts to\r\nswallow, but suddenly it chokes, half strangles, and back comes the\r\nmilk, pouring out through the nostrils. Paralysis of the soft palate has\r\noccurred from poisoning of the nerves controlling it, caused by direct\r\npenetration of the toxin. Sometimes the muscles of the eye become\r\nparalyzed and the little one squints, or can no longer see to read.\r\n\r\nFortunately, most of these alarming results go only to a certain degree,\r\nand then gradually fade away and disappear; but this may take months or\r\neven longer. In a certain number, however, the nerves of respiration, or\r\nthose controlling the heart-beat, become affected, and the patient dies\r\nsuddenly from heart failure.\r\n\r\nThis strange after-effect upon the nervous system, which was first\r\nclearly noticed in diphtheria and syphilis, has now been found to occur\r\nin lesser degree in a large number of our infectious diseases, so that\r\nmany of our most serious paralyses and other diseases of the nervous\r\nsystem are now traceable to such causes.\r\n\r\nThese effects of the diphtheria toxin are also of interest for a\r\nsomewhat unexpected reason, since it has been claimed that they are\r\neffects of the antitoxin, by those who are opposed to its use. Every one\r\nof them was well recognized as a possible result of diphtheria long\r\nbefore the antitoxin was discovered, and every one of them can be\r\nreadily produced by injections of diphtheria bacilli or their toxin into\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possibly true that there are more cases of nerve-poisoning\r\n(neuritis) and of paralysis following diphtheria than there were before\r\nthe use of antitoxin, but that is for the simple and sufficient reason\r\nthat there are more children left alive to display them! And between a\r\nchild with a temporary squint and a dead child few mothers would\r\nhesitate long in their choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE HERODS OF OUR DAY: SCARLET FEVER, MEASLES, AND WHOOPING-COUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy is a disease a disease of childhood? First and fundamentally,\r\nbecause that is the earliest period at which a human being can have it.\r\nBut the problem goes deeper than this. There is no more interesting and\r\nimportant group of diseases in the whole realm of pathology than those\r\nwhich we calmly dub \"the diseases of childhood,\" and thereby dismiss to\r\nthe limbo of unavoidable accidents and discomforts, like flies,\r\nmosquitoes, and stubbed toes, which are best treated with a shrug of the\r\nshoulders and such stoic philosophy as we can muster. They are\r\ninteresting, because the moment we begin to study them intelligently we\r\nstumble upon some of the profoundest and most far-reaching problems of\r\nresistance to disease; important, because, trifling as we regard them,\r\nand indeed largely just because we so regard them, they kill, or\r\nhandicap for life, more children in civilized communities than the most\r\ndeadly pestilence. Measles, for instance, according to the last United\r\nStates census, causes yearly nearly thirteen thousand deaths, while\r\nsmallpox causes so few that it is not listed among the important causes\r\nof death. Scarlet fever causes sixty-three hundred and thirty-three\r\ndeaths, as compared with barely five thousand from appendicitis and the\r\nsame number from rheumatism. Whooping-cough causes ninety-nine hundred\r\nand fifty-eight deaths, more than double the mortality from diabetes and\r\nnearly equal to that of malarial fever.\r\n\r\nIn medicine, as in war, the gravest and deadliest mistake that you can\r\nmake is to despise your enemy. These trivial disorders, these trifling\r\nailments, which every one takes as a matter of course, and expects to go\r\nthrough with, like teething, tight shoes, and learning to smoke, sweep\r\naway every year in these United States the lives of from forty to fifty\r\nthousand children, reaching the bad eminence of fifth upon our mortality\r\nlists, only consumption, pneumonia, heart disease, and diarrh[oe]al\r\ndiseases ranking above them. Of course, it is obvious that these\r\ndiseases outrank many other more serious ones among the \"captains of the\r\nmen of death,\" largely upon the familiar principle of the old riddle,\r\nwhereby the white sheep eat more grass than the black, \"because there\r\nare more of them.\"\r\n\r\nWhile only a relatively small percentage of us ever have the bad luck to\r\nbe attacked by typhoid fever, rheumatism, or appendicitis, to say\r\nnothing of cholera and smallpox, the vast majority of us have gone\r\nthrough two or more of these diseases of childhood; so that, though the\r\ndeath-rate of each and all of them is low, yet the number of cases is so\r\nenormous that the absolute total mounts high. But the pity and, at the\r\nsame time, the practical importance of this heavy death-roll is that _at\r\nleast two-thirds of it is absolutely preventable_, and by the exercise\r\nof only a very moderate amount of intelligence and vigilance. It is, of\r\ncourse, obvious that in a group of diseases which numbers its victims\r\nliterally by the million every year there will inevitably occur a\r\ncertain minute percentage of fatal results due to what might be termed\r\nunavoidable causes, like a badly nourished condition of the child\r\nattacked, unusual circumstances preventing proper shelter or nursing, or\r\nan exceptional virulence of the disease, such as will occur in two or\r\nthree cases of every thousand in even the most trifling infectious\r\nmalady. But even after making liberal allowance for what might be termed\r\nthe unavoidable fatalities, at least two-thirds, and more probably\r\nnine-tenths, of the deaths from children's diseases might be prevented\r\nupon two grounds:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that they are contagious and absolutely dependent upon a living\r\ngerm, whose spread can be prevented; and secondly, and practically even\r\nmore important, that more than half the deaths from them are due, not to\r\nthe disease itself, but to complications occurring during the period of\r\nrecovery, caused, for the most part, by gross carelessness on the part\r\nof the mother or nurse. A large majority, for instance, of the nearly\r\nthirteen thousand deaths attributed to measles are due to bronchitis,\r\ncaught by letting the child go out-of-doors too soon after recovery,\r\nwhich means, of course, either a chill falling upon the irritated and\r\nweakened bronchial mucous membrane, or an infection by one of the score\r\nof disease-germs, such as those of influenza, pneumonia, bronchitis, and\r\neven tuberculosis, which are continually lying in wait for just such an\r\nemergency as this--just such a weakening of the vital resistance.\r\n\r\nIt is a sadly familiar statement in the history of fatal cases of\r\ntuberculosis that the trouble \"began with an attack of measles,\" or\r\nwhooping-cough, or a bad cold, and was mistaken for a mere \"hanging on\"\r\nof one of these milder maladies until it had gained a foothold that\r\nthere was no dislodging. As breakers of the wall of the hollow square of\r\nthe body-cells, drawn up to resist the cavalry charges of tuberculosis,\r\npneumonia, and rheumatism, few can be compared in deadliness with the\r\ndiseases of childhood and \"common colds.\"\r\n\r\nFurther, while all of them except scarlet fever have a mortality so low\r\nthat it might almost be described as what the French delicately term\r\n_une quantité négligeable_, yet a surprisingly large number of the\r\nsurvivors do not escape scot-free, but bear scars which they may carry\r\nto their graves, or which may even carry them to that bourne later.\r\nAgain, the actual percentage of the survivors who are marked in this\r\nfashion is small, but such milliards of children are attacked every year\r\nthat, on the old familiar principle, \"if you throw plenty of mud some of\r\nit will stick,\" quite a serious number are more or less handicapped by\r\nthese remainders. For instance, quite a noticeable percentage of cases\r\nof chronic eye troubles, particularly of the lids and conjunctiva, such\r\nas \"granulated\" lids, styes, ulcers of the cornea, date from an attack\r\nof measles or even whooping-cough. Many cases of nasal catarrh or\r\nchronic throat trouble or bronchitis in children date from the same\r\nsource. A large group of chronic discharges from the ear and\r\nperforations of the ear-drum are a direct after-result of scarlet fever;\r\nand the frequency with which this disease causes serious disturbances of\r\nthe kidneys is almost a household word. Less definitely traceable, but\r\neven more serious in their entirety, are the large group of chronic\r\ndepression of vigor, loss of appetite, various forms of indigestion and\r\nof bowel trouble, which are left behind after the visitation of one of\r\nthese minor pests, particularly among the children of the poorer\r\nclasses, who are unable to obtain the highly nutritious, appetizing, and\r\ndelicately cooked foods which are so essential to the full recovery of\r\nthe little invalids.\r\n\r\nOne of the English commissions which was investigating the alleged\r\nphysical deterioration of city and town populations stumbled upon a\r\nsingularly interesting and significant fact in this connection, while\r\nplotting the curves of the rate of growth of the children in a given\r\ndistrict in Scotland during a series of years. They were struck with the\r\nfact that children born in certain years in the same families,\r\nneighborhoods, and presumably the same circumstances, grew more rapidly\r\nand had a lower death-rate than those born in other years; and that, on\r\nthe other hand, children born in other years fell almost as far below\r\nthe normal in their rate of growth. The only factor which they found to\r\ncoincide with these differences was that in the years in which those\r\nchildren who made the slowest growth were born there had been unusually\r\nheavy epidemics of children's diseases and a high mortality; while, on\r\nthe other hand, those years whose \"crop\" of children made the best\r\ngrowth had been unusually free from such epidemics and had a\r\ncorrespondingly low mortality, showing clearly that even the survivors\r\nof children's diseases were not only not benefited, but distinctly\r\nhandicapped and set back in their growth by the energy, so to speak,\r\nwasted in resisting the onslaught.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to an aspect of these diseases which from both a\r\nphilosophic and a practical point of view is most interesting and\r\nprofoundly significant; and that is the question with which we opened:\r\nWhy is a disease a disease of childhood? The old, primitive view was as\r\nguileless and as simple as the age in which the diseases occurred. They\r\nwere regarded not merely by the laity but by grave and reverend\r\nphysicians of the Dark Ages as a sort of necessary vital crisis peculiar\r\nand appropriate to each particular age of life,--a sort of sweating out\r\nand erupting of \"peccant humors\" of the blood, which must be got rid\r\nof or else the individual would not thrive. Incredible as it may\r\nseem, so far was this idea extended, that the great Arabian\r\nphysician-philosopher, Rhazes, actually included smallpox in this group,\r\nas the last of the \"crises of growth\" which had to appear and have its\r\nway in young manhood or womanhood. Quaint little echoes of this simple\r\nfaith still ring in the popular mind, as, for instance, in the\r\nwidespread notion about the dangerousness of doing anything to check the\r\neruption in measles and cause it to \"strike in.\" Any mother in Israel\r\nwill tell you, the first time you propose a bath or a wet pack to reduce\r\nthe temperature in measles, that if you so much as touch water to the\r\nskin of that child it will \"drive the rash in\" and cause it to die in\r\nconvulsions. And, of course, one of the commonest of a physician's\r\nmemories is the expression of relief from the mother or aunt in any of\r\nthese mild eruptive fevers, where the skin was well reddened and\r\nspotted: \"Well, anyway, doctor, it is a splendid thing to get the rash\r\nso well out!\" Until within the last ten or fifteen years it was no\r\nuncommon thing to hear the expression: \"Well, I suppose we might just as\r\nwell let Willie and Susie go on to school and get the measles and have\r\ndone with it. It seems to be a real mild sort this time.\" Of course this\r\nview was scientifically shattered two or more decades ago by our\r\nrecognition of the infectious nature of these diseases, but practically\r\nits hold on the public mind constitutes one of the most serious and\r\nvital obstacles in the way of the health-officer when he endeavors to\r\nattack and break up an epidemic of measles, whooping-cough, or\r\nchicken-pox.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly emphasized that, mild and in their immediate\r\nresults trifling, as most of these \"little diseases\" are, they are\r\ngenuine members of that class of pathologic poison-snakes, the\r\ngerm-infections; that when they bite, they bite to kill; that two to\r\nfive times in every hundred they do kill; that, like all other\r\ninfections, they are capable of inflicting serious and permanent damage\r\nupon the great vital organs, the heart, the kidneys, the liver, and the\r\nbrain; and that they are the very jackals of diseases, tracing down and\r\npointing out the prey to the lions that work in partnership with them.\r\nWith whatever we may treat measles and whooping-cough, _never_ treat\r\nthem with contempt!\r\n\r\nThe next conception of the \"whyness\" of children's diseases was that as\r\none star differs from another in glory, so does one germ differ from\r\nanother in virulence; that the germs of these particular diseases just\r\nhappened to be from the beginning unusually mild and at the same time\r\nhighly contagious, so that they remained permanently scattered about\r\nthroughout the community, and attacked each successive brood of newborn\r\nchildren as quickly as they could conveniently get at them. Being so\r\nmild and so comparatively seldom fatal, little or no alarm was excited\r\nby them and few efforts made to check their spread, so that they\r\ncontinued to flourish, generation after generation. Upon this theory the\r\ngerms of measles, chicken-pox, whooping-cough, mumps, would be in\r\nsomething like the same class as the numerous species of bacteria and\r\nother germs that normally inhabit the human mouth, stomach, and\r\nintestines; for the most part, comparatively harmless parasites, or what\r\nare technically now known as \"_symbiotes_\" (from two Greek words,\r\n_bios_, \"life,\" and _syn_, \"with\"), a sort of little partners or\r\nnon-paying boarders, for the most part harmless, but occasionally\r\ncapable of making trouble. There are scores of species of such germs in\r\nour food-canals, some of which may be even slightly helpful in the\r\nprocess of digestion. Only a very small per cent of the bacilli of any\r\nsort in the world are harmful; the vast majority are exceedingly\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nThere is evidently some truth in this view of children's diseases,\r\nespecially so far as the reason for their steady persistence and\r\nundiminished spread is concerned, namely, the comparative carelessness\r\nand indifference with which they are regarded and treated. But some\r\nrather striking developments of recent years have raised grave doubts in\r\nour minds as to whether they were always the mild and inoffensive \"house\r\ncats\" that they pass for at present. These are the astonishing and\r\nalmost incredible developments that occur when for the first time these\r\nmild and harmless \"diseaselets\" are introduced to a savage or\r\nhalf-civilized tribe. Like an Arabian Nights' transformation, our\r\nsleepy, purring, but still able to scratch, \"pussy cat\" flashes out as a\r\nravenous man-eating tiger, killing and maiming right and left.\r\nMeasles--harmless, tickly, snuffly, \"measly\" little measles--kills from\r\nthirty to sixty per cent of whole villages and tribes of Indians and\r\ncripples half the remainder!\r\n\r\nMy first direct experience with this feature of our \"household pets\" was\r\non the Pacific Coast. All the old settlers told me of a dread pestilence\r\nwhich had preceded the coming of the main wave of invading civilization,\r\nsweeping down the Columbia River. Not merely were whole clans and\r\nvillages swept out of existence, but the valley was practically\r\ndepopulated; so that, as one of the old patriarchs grimly remarked, \"It\r\nmade it a heap easier to settle it up quietly.\" So swift and so fatal\r\nhad been its onslaught that villages would be found deserted. The canoes\r\nwere rotting on the river bank above high-water mark. The curtains of\r\nthe lodges were flapped and blown into shreds. The weapons and garments\r\nof the dead lay about them, rusting and rotting. The salmon-nets were\r\nstill standing in the river, worn to tatters and fringes by the\r\ncurrent. Yet, from the best light that I was able to secure upon it, it\r\nappeared to have been nothing more than an epidemic of the measles,\r\ncaught from the child of some pioneer or trapper and spreading like\r\nwildfire in the prairie grass. A little later I had an opportunity to\r\nsee personally an epidemic of mumps in a group of Indians, and I have\r\nseldom seen fever patients, ill of any disease, who were more violently\r\nattacked and apparently more desperately ill than were sturdy young\r\nIndian boys attacked by this trifling malady. Their temperatures rose to\r\none hundred and five or one hundred and six degrees, they became\r\ndelirious, their faces were red and swollen, they ached in every limb,\r\nand the complications that occasionally follow mumps even in civilized\r\npatients were frequent and exceedingly severe. In like manner, influenza\r\nwill slay its hundreds in a tribe of less than a thousand members.\r\nChicken-pox will become so virulent as to be mistaken for smallpox.\r\nSeveral of the epidemics of alleged smallpox that have occurred among\r\nIndians and other savage tribes are now known to have been only measles.\r\nAt first, pathologists were inclined to receive these reports with some\r\ndegree of skepticism, and to regard them either as travelers' tales, or\r\nas instances of exceptional and accidental virulence in that particular\r\ntribe, the high death-rate due to bad nursing or horrible methods of\r\nvoodoo treatment.\r\n\r\nBut from all over the world came ringing in the same story, not merely\r\nfrom scores of travelers, but also from army surgeons, medical\r\nmissionaries, and medical explorers, until it has now become a\r\ndefinitely established fact that the mild, trifling diseases of infancy,\r\n\"colds\" and influenzas of civilized races, leap to the proportions of a\r\ndeadly pestilence when communicated to a savage tribe. Whether that\r\ntribe be the Eskimo of the Northern ice-sheet or the Terra del Fuegian\r\nof the Southern, the Hawaiian of the islands of the Pacific or the\r\nAymarás of the Amazon, all fall like grain before the scythe under the\r\nattack of a malady which is little more than the proverbial \"little\r\n'oliday\" of three days in bed to civilized man. Evidently civilized man\r\nhas acquired a degree and kind of immunity that uncivilized man has not.\r\nEither the disease has grown milder or civilized man tougher with the\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe probability is that both of these explanations are true. These\r\ndiseases may originally have been comparatively severe and serious; but\r\nas generation after generation has been submitted to their attack, those\r\nwho were most susceptible died or were so crippled as to be seriously\r\nhandicapped in the race of life and have left fewer and less vigorous\r\noffspring. So that, by a gradual process of weeding out the more\r\nsusceptible, the more resisting survived and became the resistant\r\ncivilized races of to-day.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, any disease which kills its victim so quickly that it\r\nhas not time to make sure of its transmission to another one before his\r\ndeath, will not have so many chances of survival as will a milder and\r\nmore chronic disorder. Hence, the milder and less fatal strains of germs\r\nwould stand the better chance of survival. This, of course, is a very\r\ncrude outline, but it probably represents something of the process by\r\nwhich almost all known diseases, except a few untamable hyenas, like the\r\nBlack Death, the cholera, and smallpox, have gradually grown milder with\r\ncivilization. If we escape the attack of these attenuated diseases of\r\ninfancy until fifteen or sixteen years of age, we can usually defy them\r\nafterward; though occasionally an unusually virulent strain will attack\r\nan adult, with troublesome consequences.\r\n\r\nAt all events, whatever explanation we may give, the consoling fact\r\nstands out clearly that civilized man is decidedly more resistant to\r\nthese pests of civilization than is any half-civilized race, and there\r\nis good reason to believe that this is a typical instance of his\r\ncomparative vigor and endurance all along the line.\r\n\r\nIf this view of the original character and taming of these diseases be\r\ncorrect, it also accounts for the extraordinary and otherwise\r\ninexplicable cases where they suddenly assume the virulence of cholera,\r\nor yellow fever, and kill within forty-eight or ninety-six hours, not\r\nmerely in children but also in adults.\r\n\r\nTo group these three diseases together simply because they all happen to\r\noccur in children would appear scarcely a rational principle of\r\nclassification. Yet, practically, widely different as they are in their\r\nultimate results and, probably, in their origin, they have so many\r\npoints in common as to their method of spread, prevention, and general\r\ntreatment, that what is said of one will with certain modifications\r\napply to all.\r\n\r\nI said \"probably\" of widely different origin, because, by one of those\r\nstrange paradoxes which so often confront us in real life, though the\r\ninfectiousness and the method of spread of all these diseases is as\r\nfamiliar as the alphabet and as firmly settled, the most careful study\r\nand innumerable researches have failed to identify positively the germ\r\nin any one of them. There are a number of \"suspects\" against which a\r\ngreat deal of circumstantial evidence exists: a streptococcus in scarlet\r\nfever, a bacillus in whooping-cough, and a protozoan in measles; but\r\nnone of these have been definitely convicted. The principal reason for\r\nour failure is a very common one in bacteriological research, whose\r\nimportance is not generally known, and that is, that there is not a\r\nsingle species of the lower animals that is subject to the diseases or\r\ncan be inoculated with them. This unfortunate condition is the greatest\r\nbarrier which can now exist to our discovery of the causation of any\r\ndisease. We were absolutely blocked, for instance, by it in smallpox and\r\nsyphilis until we discovered that our nearest blood relatives, the ape\r\nand the monkey, are susceptible to them; and then the _Cytoryctes\r\nVariolæ_ and the _Treponema pallida_ were discovered within\r\ncomparatively a few months. Some lucky day, perhaps, we may stumble on\r\nthe animal or bird which will take measles, scarlet fever, or\r\nwhooping-cough, and then we will soon find out all about them.\r\n\r\nBut, fortunately, our knowledge of these little diseases, like\r\nMercutio's wound, is \"not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church\r\ndoor; but 't is enough\" for all practical purposes. The general plan of\r\ntreatment in all of them might be roughly summed up as, rest in bed in a\r\nwell-ventilated room; sponge-baths and packs for the fever; milk, eggs,\r\nbread, and fruit diet, with plenty of cool water to drink, either plain,\r\nor disguised as lemonade or \"fizzy\" mixtures; mild local antiseptic\r\nwashes for nose and throat, and mild internal antiseptics, with\r\nlaxatives, for the bowels and kidneys. There is no known drug which is\r\nspecific in any one of them, though their course may be made milder and\r\nthe patient more comfortable by the intelligent use of a variety of\r\nremedies, which assist nature in her fight against the toxin. Not\r\nknowing the precise cause, we have as yet no reliable antitoxin for any.\r\n\r\nNow very briefly as to the earmarks of each particular member of this\r\nchildren's group. It may be said in advance that the \"openings\" of all\r\nof them (as chess-players call the first moves) are very much alike.\r\nAll of them are apt to begin with a little redness and itching of the\r\nmucous membranes of the nose, the throat, and the eyes, with consequent\r\nsnuffling and blinking and complaints of sore throat. These are\r\nfollowed, or in severe, swift cases may be preceded, by flushed cheeks,\r\ncomplaints of headache or heaviness in the head, fever, sometimes rising\r\nvery quickly to from one hundred and four to one hundred and five\r\ndegrees, backache, pains in the limbs, and, in very severe cases,\r\nvomiting. In fact, the symptoms are almost identical with those of an\r\nattack of that commonest of all acute infections, a bad cold, and\r\nprobably for the same reason, namely, that the germs, whatever they may\r\nbe, attack and enter the system by way of the nose and throat.\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult practical points about the beginning of this\r\ngroup of diseases is to distinguish them from one another, or from a\r\ncommon cold. The important thing to remember is that, theoretically\r\nimportant as it may be to make this distinction, practically it isn't\r\nnecessary at all, as they should all be treated exactly alike in the\r\nbeginning. The only vital thing is to recognize that you are dealing\r\nwith an infection of some sort, isolate promptly the little patient, put\r\nhim to bed, and make your diagnosis later as the disease develops.\r\nFortunately neither scarlet fever nor measles usually becomes acutely\r\ninfectious until the rash appears, and as neither is particularly\r\ndangerous to adults, especially to such as have had them already, a\r\none-room quarantine is sufficient for the first few days of any of these\r\ndiseases. We will lose nothing and gain enormously by adopting this\r\nroutine plan in all cases of snuffling noses, sore throats, headache,\r\nand fever in children, for these are the early symptoms of all their\r\nfebrile diseases, from colds to diphtheria; all alike are infectious and\r\nall, even to the mildest, benefited by a few days of rest and seclusion.\r\n\r\nAfter this first general blare of defiance on the part of the system to\r\nthe enemy, whoever he may be, the battle begins to take on its\r\ncharacteristic form according to the nature of the invader. We will take\r\nfirst the campaign of scarlet fever, since this is the swiftest and\r\nfirst to disclose itself. After the preliminary snuffles and headache\r\nhave lasted for a few hours, the temperature usually begins to rise; and\r\nwhen it does, by leaps and bounds often reaching one hundred and four or\r\none hundred and five degrees within twelve hours, the skin becomes dry\r\nand hot, the throat sore, the tongue parched, and the little patient\r\ndrowsy and heavy-eyed. Within from twenty-four to forty-eight hours a\r\nbright red or pinkish rash appears, first on the neck and chest, and\r\nthen rapidly spreading all over the surface of the body within another\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the throat becomes sore and swollen, ranging, according to the\r\nseverity of the case, from a slight reddening and swelling to a furious\r\nulcerative inflammation, with the formation of a thick membrane-like\r\nexudate, which sometimes is so severe as to raise a suspicion of\r\npossible diphtheria. The tongue becomes red and naked, with the papillæ\r\nshowing light against a red ground, so as to give rise to what has been\r\nknown as \"the strawberry tongue.\" The temperature is usually high, and\r\nthe little patient when he drowses off to sleep is quite apt to become\r\nmore or less delirious. In the vast majority of cases, after two to four\r\ndays of this, the temperature goes down almost as swiftly as it came up,\r\nthe rash begins to fade, the throat gets less sore, and the rebound\r\ntoward recovery sets in. About this time the daily examination of the\r\nurine will begin to show traces of albumin, but this, under strict rest\r\nin bed and careful diet, will usually diminish and ultimately disappear.\r\nIn the event of a relapse, however, or setback from any cause, the\r\nkidneys may become violently attacked, and a considerable per cent of\r\nthe fatal cases die from suppression of the urine. After this crisis has\r\noccurred, however, in ninety-nine per cent of all cases it is\r\ncomparatively plain sailing; the throat is still sore and troublesome,\r\nthe skin itches and tickles, and the eyes smart, but the little patient\r\nsteadily improves day by day. Anywhere from three to five days after\r\nthe break in the fever the skin begins to get rough and scaly, and\r\ngradually peels off, until in some cases the entire coating of the body\r\nis shed, having been killed, as it were, by the violence of the\r\neruption. These _flakes and scales of the skin are exceedingly\r\ncontagious_, and no case should be regarded as fit to be released from\r\nisolation until every particle has been shed and got rid of. This\r\nconstitutes one of the most tiresome and annoying periods of the\r\ndisease, as complete shedding is seldom finished before two weeks, and\r\nsometimes may last from three to five.\r\n\r\nHowever, this long period of contagiousness has been found to be really\r\na blessing in disguise, inasmuch as we now know that even more\r\nstrikingly than in the other children's diseases it is the period of\r\n_recovery_ that is the period of _greatest danger_ in scarlet fever.\r\nLike the Parthians of Greek history it is most dangerous when in\r\nretreat. Keeping the child at rest for the greater part of the time, in\r\nbed or on a lounge, in a well-ventilated room, or later on a porch or\r\nterrace, for five weeks from the beginning of the disease, is well worth\r\nall the trouble and inconvenience that it causes, for the sake of the\r\nalmost absolute protection it gives against dangerous and even fatal\r\ncomplications, particularly of the kidneys, heart, or lungs.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair description of what might be termed an average case of\r\nthe disease. We also have the sadly familiar type described as the\r\nfulminant or, literally, \"lightning-stroke\" variety. The child goes down\r\nas if struck by an invisible hand; vomiting is one of the first\r\nsymptoms; delirium follows within ten or twelve hours; the eruption\r\nbecomes not merely scarlet but purplish from hemorrhage under the skin,\r\ngiving the name of \"black\" scarlet fever to this type. The throat\r\nbecomes furiously swollen, the urine is absolutely suppressed, the child\r\ngoes into convulsions, and dies within forty-eight hours from the\r\nbeginning of the attack. Fortunately, this type is rare, but the\r\nimportant thing to remember is that it may develop in a child who caught\r\nthe disease from one of the mildest of all possible cases! Hence every\r\ncase should be treated with the strictest isolation, as if it were\r\nitself of the most malignant type.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the mortality of scarlet fever varies according to the type.\r\nNot only may it assume a malignant form in individual cases, but whole\r\nepidemics may be of this character, with a mortality of from twenty to\r\nthirty per cent. Generally speaking, however, the death-rate is about\r\none in twelve, ranging from as low as one in twenty-five to as high as\r\none in five.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of diphtheria, the greatest danger and most powerful\r\nmeans of spread of the disease is through the mild, unrecognized cases,\r\nwhich are supposed to have nothing but a cold and are allowed to\r\ncontinue in school or play with other children. We have no antitoxin and\r\nno bacteriologic means of positive diagnosis. But one method will stop\r\nthe spread and within ten or fifteen years exterminate every one of\r\nthese infections--_isolate at once every child_ that shows symptoms of a\r\ncold, sore throat, or feverishness, both for its own sake and for that\r\nof the community!\r\n\r\nIn measles we have to deal with a much more harmless and more nearly\r\ndomesticated \"beast of prey,\" but one of a prevalence to correspond.\r\nThough probably (exact data being as yet lacking) not more than\r\none-third of all individuals are attacked by scarlet fever, it would be\r\nsafe to say that not more than one-third, and possibly not more than\r\none-fifth, of us escape measles. Hence, though its mortality is scarcely\r\none-fourth that of scarlet fever, it more than holds its own in the\r\nHerod class, as grimly shown by its total death-roll of over twelve\r\nthousand, compared with only a little over six thousand to the credit of\r\nscarlet fever.\r\n\r\nAfter the preliminary disturbances of snuffles, hot throat, headache,\r\nand feverishness, which it shares with all the other \"little fevers,\"\r\nthe first thing to mark off measles is usually that the itching and\r\nrunning at the nose and eyes become more prominent, the child begins to\r\nturn its face away from the light because it makes its eyes smart, and\r\ncomplains not so much of soreness as of a peppery, burning, itching\r\nsensation in its nose and throat. The tongue is coated, the stomach\r\nmildly upset; the little patient is more uncomfortable and fretful than\r\nseriously ill. This condition drags on, without apparently getting\r\nanywhere, for from two to four days, during which time it is often very\r\ndifficult even for the most experienced physician to say positively what\r\nthe sufferer has. But about the fourth day a rash begins to appear,\r\ntypically first upon the cheeks or forehead in the shape of little\r\nwidely separated dull-red blotches. These grow larger and deeper in\r\ncolor, rising in the middle and spreading at their edges, so that\r\nshortly the whole skin becomes puffed and swollen and of a mottled,\r\npinkish-purple color. If the child's lower lip be pulled down, little\r\nred spots will be seen scattered over the lining membrane of the mouth,\r\nshowing that the eruption is not confined to the skin. Indeed, these\r\nKoplik's spots (as they are called, after their discoverer) in the mouth\r\nwill often appear a day or more before the eruption upon the skin and\r\ngive the first clew to the nature of the disease. These are significant,\r\nbecause they probably illustrate the process of eruption, or, at least,\r\nirritation, which is taking place, not merely upon the skin, but also\r\nupon the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and throat, the windpipe\r\nand the bronchial tubes, and which is the cause of the burning, running,\r\nand, later, occasional serious inflammatory symptoms in all these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at the hot, angry-looking, swollen skin of the little\r\nvictim of measles, the weeping eyes and running nose, and remember that\r\nthis same sort of process is either going on or is likely to occur all\r\nover his entire lining, so to speak, from lungs to bowels, you can\r\neasily grasp how important it is to keep him absolutely at rest and\r\nprotected from every possible risk in the way of chill, over-exertion,\r\nor injudicious feeding, until the whole process has completely subsided\r\nand been forgotten. Neglect of these precautions is the reason why so\r\nmany cases of measles, on the least and most trifling exposure and\r\noverstrain during the two or three weeks following the disease, will\r\nblaze up into a fatal bronchitis or pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe rash takes about two or three days to get out, then it begins to\r\nfade and the skin to peel off in tiny, branny scales, so small and thin\r\nas to be almost invisible--unlike the huge flakes of scarlet fever. At\r\nthe same time all the other symptoms recede.\r\n\r\nBut, as in scarlet fever, all cases should be treated alike, by rest,\r\nsponging and packing for the fever, light diet with plenty of milk and\r\nfruit, and confinement to the room for at least ten days after the\r\ndisappearance of the fever. The very mildest and most insignificant of\r\nattacks may be followed, through carelessness or exposure, by a fatal\r\nbronchitis. Indeed, in view of the distressing frequency with which our\r\nhistories of tuberculosis in children contain the words, \"Came on after\r\nmeasles,\" it is highly advisable to watch carefully every child as\r\nregards abundant feeding, avoidance of overwork or overstrain, and of\r\nall unnecessary exposure to infection, wind, or wet, for two months\r\nafter an attack of measles instead of the customary two weeks. As the\r\ndisease is acutely infectious, the little victim should be isolated for\r\nat least three weeks after the disappearance of the fever; but this\r\nagain, as in the case of scarlet fever, is emphatically a blessing in\r\ndisguise from his point of view, as well as a protection to the rest of\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nShould the \"little fever\" prove to be whooping-cough, it will be later\r\nstill in positively declaring its definite intentions. The cold or\r\ncatarrhal stage will be much milder, the fever lower, the cough a trifle\r\nmore marked, but will drag on for from a week to ten days before\r\nanything definite happens. Usually the child is supposed to be suffering\r\nwith a slight cold, hence the prevailing impression that colds run into\r\nwhooping-cough, if neglected. Then one day the child is suddenly seized\r\nwith a coughing fit, consisting of from ten to fifteen short coughs in\r\nrapid succession of increasing intensity, until all the air seems\r\nliterally pumped out of the lungs of the poor little patient; then, with\r\na tremendous whoop, the youngster gets his breath again and the\r\ndiagnosis is made. This distressing performance may occur only four or\r\nfive times a day, or it may be repeated every half-hour or so. So\r\nviolent is the paroxysm that the eyes of the child protrude, it becomes\r\nliterally black in the face, and runs to its mother or nurse, or\r\nclutches a chair, to keep from falling.\r\n\r\nAs the same great nerves which supply the lungs supply the stomach, the\r\nirritation frequently \"radiates,\" or spills over, from one division of\r\nit to the other, and the coughing fit is frequently followed by\r\nvomiting. Unexpectedly enough this may often become the most serious\r\npractical symptom of the disease, inasmuch as the stomach is emptied so\r\nfrequently that the poor little victim is unable to retain any\r\nnourishment long enough to absorb it, and may waste away frightfully,\r\nand even literally starve to death, or have its resisting power so\r\ngreatly lowered that an attack of bronchial trouble or bowel disturbance\r\nwill prove rapidly fatal.\r\n\r\nSo serious are the disturbances of the circulation all over the body by\r\nthese spasmodic suffocation-fits, that rupture of small blood-vessels\r\nmay occur in the eyes, the brain, in the lungs, and on the surface of\r\nthe skin. The heart becomes distended, and if originally weakened may be\r\nseriously dilated or overstrained; the lungs become congested and\r\ninflamed, and any of the numerous accidental germs which may be present\r\nwill set up a broncho-pneumonia, which is the commonest cause of death\r\nin this disease, as in measles.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, while, as we do not positively know the germ, and\r\nhence cannot state definitely either the cause or the principal seat of\r\nthe trouble, it is not generally believed that the condition of the\r\nlungs or the throat has much to do with the cough.\r\n\r\nAt all events, it is perfectly idle to treat the disease with cough\r\nmixtures or expectorants. The view toward which the majority of\r\nintelligent observers are inclined is that whooping-cough is an\r\ninfection, the germ or toxin of which attacks the nervous system, and\r\nparticularly the great \"lung-stomach\" (pneumo-gastric) nerve. At all\r\nevents, the only remedies which appear to have any effect upon the\r\ndisease are, in the early stages, mild local antiseptics in the nose and\r\nthroat, and later those which diminish the irritability of the nerves\r\nwithout upsetting the appetite or depressing the general vigor. The\r\ndisease is, for all its mildness, one of the most obstinate known.\r\n\r\nA small percentage of cases run a violent course, in spite of the most\r\nintelligent and anxious care, both medical and household; but the vast\r\nmajority of such complications as occur are either caused by\r\ncarelessness or become serious only if neglected. Treating all children\r\nwith whooping-cough as emphatically sick children, entitled to every\r\ncare and excuse from exertion, every exemption and privilege that can be\r\ngiven them until the last whoop has been whooped, would prevent at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the almost ten thousand deaths from whooping-cough that\r\nyearly disgrace the United States.\r\n\r\nTo sum up in fine: intelligent, effective isolation of all cases, the\r\nmild no less than the severe, would stamp out these Herods of the\r\ntwentieth century within ten years. In the meantime, six weeks'\r\nsick-leave, with all the privileges and care appertaining thereto, will\r\nrob them of two-thirds of their terrors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAPPENDICITIS, OR NATURE'S REMNANT SALE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not made all at once, nor do we go to pieces all at once, like\r\nthe \"one-hoss shay.\" This is largely because we are not all of the same\r\nage, clear through. Some parts of us are older than other parts. We have\r\nalways felt a difficulty, not to say a delicacy, in determining the age\r\nof a given member of the human species--especially of the gentler sex.\r\nNow we know the reason of it. From the biologic point of view, we are\r\nnot an individual, but a colony; not a monarchy, but a confederacy of\r\norgan-states, each with its millions of cell-citizens. It is not merely\r\neditors and crowned heads who have a biologic right to say \"We.\"\r\nTherefore, obviously, any statement that we make as to our age can be\r\nonly in the nature of an average struck between the ages of our heart,\r\nlungs, liver, stomach; and as these vary in ancientness by thousands of\r\nyears, the average must be both vague and misleading. The only reason\r\nwhy there is a mystery about a woman's age is that she is so intensely\r\nhuman and natural. The only statement as to our age that the facts would\r\nstrictly justify us in making must partake of the vagueness of Mr. A.\r\nWard's famous confession that he was \"between twenty-three summers.\"\r\n\r\nAs we individually climb our own family-tree, from the first, one-celled\r\ndroplet of animal jelly up, none of our organs is older than we are,\r\nbut a number of them are younger. The appendix is one of these. Now, by\r\nsome curious coincidence, explain it as we may, some of our oldest\r\norgans are youngest, in the sense of most vigorous, elastic, and\r\nresisting, while some of our youngest are oldest, in the sense of\r\ndecrepit, feeble, and unstable. It is perhaps only natural that an organ\r\nlike the stomach, for instance, which has a record of honorable service\r\nand active duty millions of years long, should be better poised, more\r\nreliable, and more resourceful than one which, like the lung or the\r\nappendix, has, as it were, a \"character\" of only about one-tenth of that\r\nlength. However this may be, the curious fact confronts us that\r\nscattered about through the body are structures and fragments, the\r\nremains of organs which at one time in our ancestral career were, under\r\nthe then existing circumstances, of utility and value, but have now\r\nbecome mere survivals, remnants,--in the language of the day, \"back\r\nnumbers.\" Some of these have still a certain degree of utility, though\r\ndiminished and still diminishing in size and functional importance, like\r\nour third molars or \"wisdom\" teeth, our fifth or \"little\" toes, our\r\ngall-bladder, our coccyx or tail-bone, the hair-glands scattered all\r\nover the now practically hairless surface of our bodies, and our once\r\nmovable ears, which can no longer be \"pricked,\" or laid back. These,\r\nthough of far less utility and importance than they obviously were at\r\none time, still earn their salt, and, though all capable of causing us\r\nconsiderable annoyance on slight provocation, seldom give rise to\r\nserious trouble or inconvenience. There are, however, a few of these\r\n\"oversights\" which are of little or no known utility, and yet which,\r\neither by their structure or situation, may become the starting-point of\r\nserious trouble.\r\n\r\nThe best known members of this small group are the openings through the\r\nabdominal wall, which, originally placed at the strongest and safest\r\nposition in the quadrupedal attitude, are now, in the erect attitude, at\r\nthe weakest and most dangerous, and furnish opportunity for those\r\nserious and sometimes fatal escapes of portions of the intestines which\r\nwe call hernia; the tonsils; and our friend the _appendix vermiformis_.\r\n\r\nFor once its name expresses it exactly. It _is_ an \"appendix,\" an\r\nafterthought; and it is \"_vermiformis_,\" a worm-like creature,--and,\r\nlike the worm, will sometimes turn when trodden on. Its worm-likeness is\r\nsignificant in another sense also, in that it is this very\r\ndiminutiveness in size--the coils into which it is thrown, the spongy\r\nthickness of its walls, and the readiness with which its calibre or its\r\ncirculation is blocked--that is the fundamental cause of its tendency to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe cause of appendicitis is the appendix.\r\n\r\n\"Despise not the day of small things\" is good pathology as well as\r\nScripture. Here we have a little, worm-shaped tag, or side branch, of\r\nthe food-tube, barely three or four inches long, of about the diameter\r\nof a small quill and of a calibre that will barely admit an ordinary\r\nknitting needle. And yet we speak of it with bated breath. When we\r\nremember that this little, twisted, blind tube opens directly out of one\r\nof the largest pouches of the intestines (the _cæcum_), and that it is\r\neasy for anything that may be present in the large pouch--food,\r\nirritating fragments of waste matter, or bacteria--to find its way into\r\nthis fatal little trap, but very difficult to find the way out again, we\r\ncan form some idea of what a literal death-trap it may become.\r\n\r\nHow did such a useless and dangerous structure ever come to develop in a\r\nbody in which for the most part there is mutual helpfulness, utility,\r\nand perfect smoothness of working through all the great machine? To\r\nattempt to answer this would carry us very far back into ancient\r\nhistory. But to make such backward search is absolutely the only means\r\nof reaching an answer.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" some one will object, \"how perfectly irrational, not to say\r\nabsurd, to propose to go back hundreds of thousands of years into\r\nancient history, to account for a disease which has been\r\ndiscovered--according to some, invented--within the past twenty-five\r\nyears!\"\r\n\r\nAppendicitis is a mark, not a result, of a high grade of civilization.\r\nTo have had an operation for it is one of the insignia of modern rank\r\nand culture. Our new biologic aristocracy, the \"Appendix-Free,\" look\r\ndown with gentle disdain upon their appendiciferous fellows who still\r\nbear in their bodies this troublesome mark of their lowly origin. In\r\nshort, the general impression prevails that appendicitis is a new\r\ndisease, a disease which has become common, or perhaps occurred at all,\r\nonly within the last quarter of a century, and which therefore--with the\r\nusual flying leap of popular logic--is a serious menace to our future,\r\nif it keeps on increasing in frequency and ferocity at anything like\r\nthe same rate which it has apparently shown for the past fifteen years.\r\n\r\nAs this feeling of apprehension is in many minds quite genuine, it may\r\nbe well to say briefly, before proceeding further, first, that, if there\r\nbe any disease which absolutely and almost exclusively depends upon\r\ndefinite peculiarities of structure, it is appendicitis, and that these\r\nstructural peculiarities of this tiny, cramped tag of the food-canal\r\nhave existed from the earliest infancy of the race. So it is almost\r\nunthinkable that man should not have been subject to fatal disturbances\r\nof this organ from the very earliest times. On the post-mortem table,\r\nthe appendix of the lowest savage is the same useless, shriveled, and\r\ninflammable worm as that of the most highly civilized Aryan, though\r\nperhaps an inch or so longer. Secondly, there is absolutely no adequate\r\nproof that appendicitis is increasing in frequency among civilized\r\nraces. It is only about twenty-five years ago that it was first\r\ndefinitely described, and barely fifteen that the profession began at\r\nall generally to recognize it.\r\n\r\nBut all of us whose memory extends backward a quarter of a century can\r\nclearly recall that, while we did not see any cases of \"appendicitis,\"\r\nwe saw dozens of cases of \"acute enteritis,\" \"idiopathic (self-caused)\r\nperitonitis,\" \"acute inflammation of the bowels,\" \"acute obstruction of\r\nthe bowels,\" of which patients died both painfully and promptly, and\r\nwhich we now know were really appendicitis.\r\n\r\nIn short, from a careful study of all the data, including the claims so\r\nfrequently made of freedom from appendicitis on the part of Oriental\r\nraces, colored races, less civilized tribes, vegetarians, and others, we\r\nare tending toward the conclusion that the percentage of appendicitis in\r\na given community is simply the percentage of its recognition,--in other\r\nwords, of the intelligence and alertness, first of its physicians, and\r\nthen of its laity. As an illustration, my friend Dr. Bloodgood kindly\r\nhad the statistics of the surgical patients treated in the great Johns\r\nHopkins Hospital at Baltimore investigated for me, and found almost\r\nprecisely the same percentage of cases of appendicitis among colored\r\npatients as among white patients.\r\n\r\nThe earlier impression, first among physicians and now in the laity,\r\nthat appendicitis is an almost invariably fatal disease, is not well\r\nfounded, and we now know that a large percentage of cases recover, at\r\nleast from the first attack; so that it is quite possible for from half\r\nto two-thirds of the cases of appendicitis actually occurring in a given\r\ncommunity to escape recognition, unless promptly reported, carefully\r\nexamined, and accurately diagnosed. Thirdly, in spite of the remarkable\r\nnotoriety which the disease has attained, the general dread of its\r\noccurrence,--which has been recently well expressed in a statement that\r\neverybody either has had it, or expects to have it, or knows somebody\r\nwho has had it,--the actual percentage of occurrence of grave\r\nappendicitis is small. In the United States census of 1900, which was\r\nthe first census in which it was recognized as a separate cause of\r\ndeath, it was responsible for only 5000 deaths in the entire United\r\nStates for the ten years preceding, or about one death in two hundred.\r\nThis rate is corroborated by the data, now reaching into thousands, from\r\nthe post-mortem rooms of our great hospitals, which report an average of\r\nbetween a half and one per cent. A disease which, in spite of the\r\nwidespread terror of it, kills only one in two hundred of those who\r\nactually die--or about one in every ten thousand of our population--is\r\ncertainly nothing to become seriously excited over from a racial point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nWhile appendicitis is one of the \"realest\" and most substantial of\r\ndiseases, and, in its serious form, highly dangerous to life, there can\r\nbe little doubt that there has come, first of all, a state of mind\r\nalmost approaching panic in regard to it; and, second, a preference for\r\nit as a diagnosis, as so much more _distingué_ than such plebeian names\r\nas \"colic,\" \"indigestion,\" \"enteritis,\" or the plain old Saxon\r\n\"belly-ache,\" which has reached almost the proportions of a fad. It is\r\ncertain that nowadays physicians have almost as frequently to refuse to\r\noperate on those who are clamoring for the distinction, as to urge a\r\nneeded operation upon those unwilling to submit to it.\r\n\r\nThe satirical proposal that a \"closed season\" should be established by\r\nlaw for appendicitis as for game birds, during which none might be\r\ntaken, would apply almost as often to the laity as to the profession,\r\neven the surgical half.\r\n\r\nSince the chief cause of appendicitis is the appendix, the first\r\nquestion for disposal is, How did the appendix become an appendix? To\r\nthis biology can render a fairly satisfactory answer. It is the remains\r\nof one of Mother Nature's experiments with her 'prentice hand upon the\r\nmammalian food-tube. As is now generally known, the food-canal in\r\nanimals was originally a comparatively straight tube, running the length\r\nof the body from mouth to anus. It early distends into a moderate pouch,\r\nabout a third of the way down from the mouth, forming a _stomach_, or\r\nstorage and churning-place for the food. Below this, it lengthens into\r\ncoils (the so-called _small intestine_), which, as the body becomes more\r\ncomplex, increase in number and length until they reach four to ten\r\ntimes the length of the body. Later, the lower third of the tube\r\ndistends and sacculates out into a so-called _large intestine_, in which\r\nthe last remnants of nutritive material and of moisture are extracted\r\nfrom the food-residues before they are discharged from the body. Just at\r\nthe junction of this large intestine with the small intestine, nature\r\ntook it into her head to develop a second pouch, a sort of copy of the\r\nstomach. This pouch, from the fact that it ends in a blind sac, is known\r\nas the _cæcum_ (or \"blind\" pouch), and is apparently simply a means of\r\ndelaying the passage of the foodstuffs until all the nutriment and\r\nmoisture have been absorbed out of them for the service of the body.\r\nNaturally, it has developed to the largest degree and size in those\r\nanimals which have lived upon the bulkiest and grassiest of foods, the\r\nso-called _Herbivora_, or grass-eaters. In the _Carnivora_, or\r\nflesh-eaters, it is usually small, and in one family, the bears,\r\nentirely absent. This pouch is no mere figure of speech, as may be\r\ngathered from the fact that in certain of the rodent _Herbivora_, like\r\nthe common guinea-pig, it may have a capacity equal to all of the rest\r\nof the alimentary canal, and in the horse it will hold something like\r\nfour times as much as the stomach. Oddly enough, among the grass-eaters,\r\nfor some reason which we do not understand, it appears to occur in a\r\nsort of inverse proportion to the stomach; those which have large,\r\nsacculate, pouched stomachs, like the cow, sheep, and the ruminants\r\ngenerally, having smaller _cæca_. In other _Herbivora_ with small\r\nstomachs, like the rabbit and the horse, it develops greater size.\r\n\r\nOur primitive ancestors were mixed feeders, and, though probably more\r\nlargely herbivorous than we are to-day, had a medium-sized _cæcum_, and\r\nmaintained it up to the point at which the anthropoid apes began to\r\nbranch off from our family-tree. But at about this point, for some\r\nreason, possibly connected with the increasing variety and improved\r\nquality and concentration of the food, due to greater intelligence and\r\nability to obtain it, this large _cæcum_ became unnecessary, and began\r\nto shrivel.\r\n\r\nHere, however, is where nature makes her first afterthought mistake.\r\nInstead of allowing this pouch to contract and shrivel uniformly\r\nthroughout its entire length, she allowed the farther (or _distal_)\r\ntwo-thirds of it to shrivel down at a much faster rate than the central\r\n(or _proximal_) third; so that the once evenly distended sausage-shaped\r\npouch, about six to eight inches long and two inches in diameter, has\r\nbecome distorted down into a narrow, contracted end portion, about a\r\nquarter of an inch in diameter, and a distended first portion, for all\r\nthe world like a corncob pipe with a crooked stem and an unusually large\r\nbowl. And behold--the modern _appendix vermiformis_, with all its fatal\r\npossibilities!\r\n\r\nIf we want something distinctly human to be proud of, we may take the\r\nappendix, for man is the only animal that has this in its perfection. A\r\nsomewhat similarly shriveled last four inches of the _cæcum_ is found in\r\nthe anthropoid apes and in the wombat, a burrowing marsupial of\r\nAustralia. In some of the monkeys, and in certain rodents like the\r\nguinea-pig, a curious imitation appendix is found, which consists simply\r\nof a contracted last four or five inches of the _cæcum_, which, however,\r\non distention with air, is found to relax and expand until of the same\r\nsize as the rest of the gut.\r\n\r\nThe most strikingly and distinctly human thing about us is not our\r\nbrain, but our appendix. And, while recognizing its power for mischief,\r\nit is only fair to remember that it is an incident and a mark of\r\nprogress, of difficulties overcome, of dangers survived. In all\r\nprobability, it was our change to a more carnivorous diet, and\r\nconsequently predatory habits, which enabled our ancestors to step out\r\nfrom the ruck of the \"_Bandar-Log_,\" the Monkey Peoples. An increase in\r\ncarnivorousness must have been a powerful help to our survival, both by\r\nwidening our range of diet, so that we could live and thrive on anything\r\nand everything we could get our hands on, and by inspiring greater\r\nrespect in the bosoms of our enemies. Let us therefore respect the\r\nappendix as a mark and sign of historic progress and triumph, even\r\nwhile recognizing to the full its unfortunate capabilities for mischief.\r\n\r\nBut what has this ancient history to do with us in the twentieth\r\ncentury? Much in every way. First, because it furnishes the physical\r\nbasis of our troubles; and second, and most important, because, like\r\nother history, it is not merely repeating itself, but continuing. This\r\nprocess of shriveling on the part of the appendix is not ancient history\r\nat all, but exceedingly modern; indeed, it is still going on in our\r\nbodies, unless we are over sixty-five years of age.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have actually passed through two-thirds of this\r\nprocess in our own individual experience.\r\n\r\nAt the first appearance of the _cæcum_, or blind pouch, in our prenatal\r\nlife, it is of the same calibre as the rest of the intestine, and of\r\nuniform size from base to tip. About three weeks later the tip begins to\r\nshrivel, and from this on the process steadily continues, until at birth\r\nit has contracted to about one-fifteenth of the bulk of the _cæcum_. But\r\nthe process doesn't stop here, though its progress is slower. By about\r\nthe fifth year of life the stem of the cæco-appendix pipe has diminished\r\nto about one-thirtieth of the size of the bowl, which is the proportion\r\nthat it maintains practically throughout the rest of adult life. For a\r\nlong time we concluded that the process was here finished, and that the\r\nappendix underwent no further spontaneous changes during life; but,\r\nafter appendicitis became clearly recognized, a more careful study was\r\nmade of the condition of the appendix in bodies coming to the\r\npost-mortem table, dead of other diseases, at all ages of life. This\r\nquickly revealed an extraordinary and most significant fact, that, while\r\nthe appendix was no longer decreasing in apparent size, its internal\r\ncapacity or calibre was still diminishing, and at such a rate that by\r\nthe thirty-fifth year it had contracted down so as to become cut off\r\nfrom the cavity of the _cæcum_ in about twenty-five to thirty per cent\r\nof all individuals. By the forty-fifth year, according to the anatomist\r\nRibbert (who has made the most extensive study of the subject), nearly\r\nfifty per cent of all appendices are found to be cut off, and by the\r\nsixty-fifth year nearly seventy per cent.\r\n\r\nThis explains at once why appendicitis is so emphatically a disease of\r\nyoung life, the largest number of cases occurring before the\r\ntwenty-fifth year (fifty per cent of all cases occur between ten and\r\nthirty years of age), and becoming distinctly rarer after the\r\nthirty-fifth, only about twenty per cent occurring after this age. As\r\nsoon as the cavity of the appendix is cut off from that of the\r\nintestine, it is of course obvious that infectious or other irritating\r\nmaterials can no longer enter its cavity to cause trouble, although, of\r\ncourse, it is still subject to accidents due to kinks, or twists, or\r\ninterference with its blood-supply; but these are not so dangerous,\r\nproviding there be no infectious germs present.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have a clear and adequate physical basis for\r\nappendicitis. A small, twisted, shriveling spur or side twig of the\r\nintestine, opening from a point which has become a kind of settling\r\nbasin in the food-tube, its mouth gaping, as it were, to admit any\r\npoisonous or irritating food, infectious materials, disease-germs, the\r\nordinary bacteria which swarm in the alimentary canal, or irritating\r\nforeign bodies, like particles of dirt, sand, hairs, fragments of bone,\r\npins, etc., which may have been accidentally swallowed. Once these\r\nirritating and infectious materials have entered it, spasm of its\r\nmuscular coat is promptly set up, their escape is blocked, and a violent\r\ninflammation easily follows, which may end in rupture, perforation, or\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nNot only may any infection which is sweeping along the alimentary canal,\r\nthrown off and resisted by the vigorous, full-sized, well-fed intestine,\r\nfind a point of lowered resistance and an easy victim for its attack in\r\nthe appendix, but there is now much evidence to indicate that the\r\nordinary bacteria which inhabit the alimentary canal, particularly that\r\nfirst cousin of the typhoid bacillus, the colon bacillus, when once\r\ntrapped in this _cul-de-sac_, may quickly acquire dangerous powers and\r\nset up an acute inflammation. It is not necessary to suppose that any\r\nparticular germ or infection causes appendicitis. Any one which passes\r\nthrough, or attacks, the alimentary canal is quite capable of it, and\r\nprobably does cause its share of the attacks.\r\n\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to show that appendicitis is\r\nparticularly likely to follow typhoid fever, rheumatism, influenza,\r\ntonsilitis, and half a dozen other infectious or inflammatory processes.\r\nBut about all that has been demonstrated is that it may follow any of\r\nthem, though in none with sufficient frequency or constancy to enable it\r\nto be regarded as one of the chief or even one of the important causes\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nOne dread, however, we may relieve our anxious souls of, and that is the\r\nfamous grape-seed or cherry-stone terror. To use a Hibernianism, one of\r\nour most positive conclusions in regard to the cause of appendicitis is\r\na negative one: that it is not chiefly, or indeed frequently, due to the\r\npresence of foreign bodies. This was a most natural conclusion in the\r\nearly days of the disease, since, given a tiny blind pouch with a\r\nconstricted opening gaping upon the cavity of the food-canal, nothing\r\ncould be more natural than to suppose that small irritating food\r\nremnants or foreign bodies, slipping into it and becoming lodged, would\r\nblock it and give rise to serious inflammation. And, moreover, this _a\r\npriori_ expectation was apparently confirmed by the discovery, in many\r\nappendices removed by operation, of small oval or rounded masses,\r\nclosely resembling the seed of some vegetable or fruit. Whereupon\r\nanxious mothers promptly proceeded to order their children to \"spit\r\nout,\" with even more religious care than formerly, every grape-seed and\r\ncherry-stone. The increased use of fresh and preserved fruits was\r\nactually gravely cited, particularly by our Continental brethren, as one\r\nof the causes of this new American disease. Barely ten years ago I was\r\nspending the summer in the Adirondacks, and was bitterly reproached by\r\nthe host of one of the Lake hotels, because the profession had so\r\nterrified the public about the dangers of appendicitis from fruit-seeds\r\nthat he was utterly unable to serve upon his tables a large stock of\r\ndelicious preserved and canned raspberries, blackberries, and grapes\r\nwhich he had put up the previous years. \"Why,\" he said, \"more than half\r\nthe people that come up here will no more eat them than they would\r\npoison, for fear that some of the seeds will give 'em appendicitis.\"\r\nThis dread, however, has been deprived of all rational basis, first, by\r\nfinding that many inflamed appendices removed, after the operation\r\nbecame more common, contained no foreign body whatever; secondly, that\r\nmany perfectly healthy appendices examined on the post-mortem table,\r\ndeath being due to other diseases, contain these apparently foreign\r\nbodies; and thirdly, that when these \"foreign bodies\" were cut into,\r\nthey were found to be not seeds or pits of any description, but hardened\r\nand, in some cases, partially calcareous masses of the fæces.\r\n\r\nWe are in a nearly similar position in regard to the third alleged cause\r\nof appendicitis, and that is food. Many are the accusations which have\r\nbeen made in this field. On the one hand, meat and animal foods\r\ngenerally have been denounced, on account of their supposed \"heating\" or\r\n\"uric-acid-forming\" properties; while on the other, vegetables and\r\nfruits have been equally hotly incriminated, on account of their seeds,\r\nfibres, husks, and irritating substances, and the danger of their being\r\ncontaminated by bacteria and other parasites from the soil. These\r\ncharges appear to have little adequate foundation, and, so far as we are\r\nin a position now to judge, the only way a food can give, or be\r\naccessory to, appendicitis is by its being taken in such excessive\r\namounts as to set up fermentive or putrefactive changes in the\r\nalimentary canal, or by its being in an unsound, decaying, or actually\r\ndiseased condition. Any amounts or quality of food which are capable of\r\ngiving rise to an attack of acute indigestion may secondarily lead to an\r\nattack of appendicitis. The only single article of diet whose ingestion\r\nis declared by Osler to be rather frequently followed by an attack of\r\nappendicitis is the peanut.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the best thing to do in the way of taking precautions against\r\nthe occurrence of appendicitis is, in the language of the day, to\r\n\"forget it\" as completely as possible, reassuring ourselves that, in\r\nspite of its extraordinary notoriety and popularity, it is a\r\ncomparatively rare disease in its fatal form, responsible for not more\r\nthan one-half of one per cent of the deaths, and that the older we grow,\r\nthe better become our chances of escaping it.\r\n\r\nWhatever we may have decided in regard to our brains, by the time we\r\nreach fifty, we may feel reasonably sure we've no appendix.\r\n\r\nBut the question will at once arise, if the appendix be so tiny in size,\r\nso insignificant in capacity, and so devoid of useful function, what is\r\nthe use of disturbing ourselves over the question of what may become of\r\nit? If it is going to decay and drop off, why not permit it to do so,\r\nwith the philosophic indifference with which we would sacrifice the tip\r\nof our little fingers in a planing-mill? Here, however, is just the rub,\r\nand the fact that gives to appendicitis all its terrors, and to the\r\nquestion of what to do in each particular case its difficulties and\r\nperplexities.\r\n\r\nThe appendix does not, unfortunately, hang out from the surface of the\r\nbody, where it could peacefully decay and drop off without prejudice to\r\nthe rest of the body, or be quickly lopped off in the event of its\r\ngiving trouble. On the contrary, it projects its stubby and\r\ninsignificant length right into the midst of the most delicate and\r\nsusceptible cavity of the body, the general cavity of the abdomen, or\r\nperitoneum. The thin, sensitive sheet of peritoneum which lines this\r\ncavity covers every fold and part of the food-tube, from the stomach\r\ndown to the rectum. And when once infection or inflammation has occurred\r\nat any point in it, there is nothing to prevent its spreading like a\r\nprairie fire, all over the entire abdominal cavity from diaphragm to\r\npelvis. If this wretched little remnant were a coil of explosive fuse\r\nwithin the brain-cavity itself, which any jar might set off, it could\r\nhardly be richer in possibilities of danger.\r\n\r\nA redeeming feature of appendicitis is that the appendix lies--so to\r\nspeak--in a corner, or wide-mouthed pouch, of the great peritoneal\r\ncavity; and if the inflammation set up in it can be \"walled off\" from\r\nthe rest of the peritoneal cavity, and limited strictly to this little\r\ncorner or pouch, all will be well. This is what occurs in those cases of\r\nsevere appendicitis which spontaneously recover. If, however, this\r\ndisturbance bursts its barriers, and lights up an inflammation of the\r\nentire peritoneal cavity, then the result is likely to be a fatal one.\r\nJust how far nature can be trusted in each particular case to limit and\r\nstamp out the process in this manner is the core of the problem that\r\nconfronts us, as attending physicians.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of cases, fortunately, the peritoneal fire brigade acts\r\npromptly, pours out a wall of exudate, and locks up the appendix in a\r\nliving prison, to fight out its own battles and sink or swim by itself.\r\nBut unfortunately, in a minority of cases, by a wretched sort of\r\n\"senatorial courtesy\" which exists in the body, the appendix is given\r\nits ancestral or traditional rights and allowed to inflict its petty\r\ntroubles upon the entire abdominal cavity, and include the body in its\r\ndownfall.\r\n\r\nLastly come the two most pertinent and appealing questions:--\r\n\r\nWhat is the outlook for me if I should develop appendicitis? And what is\r\nto be done?\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first of these, it is safe to say that our answer is\r\nmuch less alarming than it was in the earlier stage of our knowledge.\r\nNaturally enough, in the beginning, only the severest and most\r\nunmistakable forms of the disease and those which showed no tendency to\r\nlocalization, were recognized, or at least came under the eye of the\r\nsurgeon; and as a large percentage of these resulted fatally, the\r\nconclusion was reached, both in the medical profession and by the laity,\r\nthat appendicitis was an exceedingly dangerous disease, with a high\r\nfatality in all cases. As, however, physicians became more expert in the\r\nrecognition of the disease, it was discovered to be vastly more common,\r\nwhile side by side came the consoling knowledge that a considerable\r\npercentage of cases got well of themselves, in the sense of the\r\ninflammation being limited to the lower right-hand corner of the\r\nabdominal cavity, though, of course, with the possibility of leaving a\r\nsmouldering fuse which might light up another explosion under any stress\r\nin future.\r\n\r\nFurther, as the attention of the post-mortem investigators at our large\r\nhospitals was directed to the subject, it was found that a very\r\nconsiderable percentage of all bodies, ranging from twenty to--according\r\nto some estimates--as high as sixty per cent, showed changes in the\r\nappendix and its neighborhood which were believed to be due to old\r\ninflammations; so that, while it is possible to speak only with great\r\ncaution and reserve, the balance of opinion among clinicians and\r\npathologists of wide experience and the more conservative surgeons\r\nappears to be that from one-half to two-thirds of all cases of\r\nappendicitis will recover of themselves, in the sense of subsiding more\r\nor less permanently, without causing death.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it must be remembered that the appendix is an organ\r\nwhich, so far as any evidence has been adduced, is entirely without\r\nuseful function; that it is in process of shriveling and disappearance,\r\nif left entirely alone, and that the best result which can be expected\r\nfrom a self-cured attack of appendicitis is the destruction of the\r\nappendix and its elimination as a further possible cause of mischief. By\r\navoiding an operation in appendicitis, we may be practically certain\r\nthat we save nothing that is worth saving--except the fee. Moreover,\r\neven though only from one-fourth to one-third of all cases develop\r\nserious complications, you never can be quite sure in which division\r\nyour particular case will fall.\r\n\r\nThe situation is in fact a little bit like one related in the\r\nexperience of Edison, the inventor. The trustees of a church in a\r\nneighboring town had just completed a beautiful new church building with\r\na high spire, projecting far above any other building in the town. When\r\nit was nearing completion, the question arose, should they put on a\r\nlightning-rod. The great church itself had strained their financial\r\nresources, and one party in the board were of the opinion that they\r\nshould avoid this unnecessary expense, supporting their economic\r\nattitude by the argument that, to put on a lightning-rod, would argue a\r\nlack of trust in Providence. Finally, after much debate, it was decided,\r\nas the great electrician was readily accessible, to submit the question\r\nto him. Mr. Edison listened gravely to the arguments presented, pro and\r\ncon.\r\n\r\n\"What is the height of the building, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\nThe number of feet was given.\r\n\r\n\"How much is that above that of any surrounding structures?\"\r\n\r\nThe data were supplied.\r\n\r\n\"It is a church, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the great man, \"on the whole, I should advise you to put on\r\na lightning-rod. Providence is apt to be, at times, a trifle\r\nabsent-minded.\"\r\n\r\nThe chances are in favor of your recovery, but--put on a lightning-rod,\r\nin the shape of the best and most competent doctor you know, and be\r\nguided entirely by his opinion. An attack of appendicitis is like\r\nshooting the Grand Lachine Rapids. Probably you will come through all\r\nright; but there is always the possibility of landing at a moment's\r\nnotice on the rocks or in the whirlpools. With a good pilot your risk\r\ndoesn't exceed a fraction of one per cent. And fortunately this\r\ncondition has been not merely theoretically but practically reached\r\nalready; for the later series of case-groups of appendicitis treated in\r\nthis intelligent way by coöperation between the physician and surgeon\r\nfrom the start, with prompt interference in those cases which to the\r\npracticed eye show signs of making trouble, has reduced the actual\r\nrecorded mortality of the disease to between two and five per cent. Even\r\nof those cases which come to operation now, the death-rate has been\r\nreduced as low as five per cent, in series of from 400 to 600 successive\r\noperations. When we contrast this with the first results of operation,\r\nwhen the cases as a rule were seen too late for the best time of\r\ninterference, and from twenty per cent to thirty per cent died; and with\r\nthe intermediate stage, when surgeons as a rule were inclined to advise\r\noperation at the earliest possible moment that the disease could be\r\nrecognized, and from ten per cent to fifteen per cent died, we can see\r\nhow steady the improvement has been, and how encouraging the outlook is\r\nfor the future.\r\n\r\nCases which have weathered one attack of appendicitis are of course by\r\nno means free from the risk of another. Indeed, at one time it was\r\nbelieved that a recurrence was almost certain to occur. Later\r\ninvestigations, based upon larger numbers of cases, now running up into\r\nthe thousands, give the reassuring result that though this danger is a\r\nreal one, it is not so great as it was at one time supposed, as the\r\naverage number in whom a second attack occurs appears to be about\r\ntwenty per cent. This, however, is a large enough risk to be worthy of\r\nserious consideration; and in view of the fact that the mortality of\r\noperations done between attacks is less than one per cent, it is\r\ngenerally the feeling of the profession that, where there is any\r\nappreciable soreness, or tenderness, or liability to attacks of pain in\r\nthe right iliac region, in an individual who has had one attack of\r\nappendicitis, the really conservative and prudent procedure is to have\r\nthe source of the trouble removed once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe four principal symptoms of appendicitis are: pain, which is usually\r\nfelt most keenly somewhere between the umbilicus and the right groin,\r\nthough this is by no means invariable; tenderness in that same region\r\nupon pressure; rigidity of the muscles of the abdominal wall on the\r\nright side; and temperature, or fever.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much and how variegated pain you may have in the abdomen,\r\nor how high your temperature may run, if you are not distinctly sore on\r\nfirm pressure down in this right lower or southwest quadrant of the\r\nabdomen,--but be careful not to press too hard, it isn't safe,--you may\r\nfeel fairly sure that you haven't got appendicitis. If you are, you may\r\nstill not have it, but you'd better send for the doctor, to be sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMALARIA: THE PESTILENCE THAT WALKETH IN DARKNESS; THE GREATEST FOE OF\r\nTHE PIONEER\r\n\r\n\r\nMalaria has probably killed more human beings than all the wars that\r\nhave ever devastated the globe. Some day the epic of medicine will be\r\nwritten, and will show what a large and unexpected part it has played in\r\nthe progress of civilization. Valuable and essential to that progress as\r\nwere the classic great discoveries of fire, ships, wheeled carriages,\r\nsteam, gunpowder, and electricity, they are almost paralleled by the\r\nvictories of sanitary science and medicine in the cure and prevention of\r\nthat greatest disrupter of the social organism--disease. No sooner does\r\nthe primitive human hive reach that degree of density which is the one\r\nindispensable condition of civilization, than it is apt to breed a\r\npestilence which will decimate and even scatter it. Smallpox, cholera,\r\nand bubonic plague have blazed up at intervals in the centres of\r\ngreatest congestion, to scourge and shatter the civilization that has\r\nbred them. No civilization could long make headway while it incurred the\r\ndangers from its own dirtiness; and to-day the most massive and imposing\r\nremains of past and gone empires are their aqueducts, their sewers, and\r\ntheir public baths. What chance has a community of building up a steady\r\nand efficient working force, or even an army large enough for adequate\r\ndefense, when it has a constant death-rate of ten per cent per annum,\r\nand an ever recurrent one of twenty to thirty per cent, by the sweep of\r\nsome pestilence? The bubonic plague alone is estimated to have slain\r\nthirty millions of people within two centuries in Mediæval Europe, and\r\nto have turned whole provinces into little better than deserts.\r\n\r\nIn malaria, however, we have a disease enemy of somewhat different class\r\nand habits. While other great infections attack man usually where he is\r\nstrongest and most numerous, malaria, on the contrary, lies in wait for\r\nhim where he is weakest and most scattered, upon the frontiers of\r\ncivilization and the borders of the wilderness. It is only of late years\r\nthat we have begun to realize what a deadly and persistent enemy of the\r\nfrontiersman and pioneer it is. We used to hear much of climate as an\r\nobstacle to civilization and barrier to settlement. Now, for climate we\r\nread \"malaria.\" Whether on the prairies or even the tundras of the\r\nNorth, or by the jungles and swamps of the Equator, the _thing that\r\nkilled_ was eight times out of ten the winged messenger of death with\r\nhis burden of malaria-infection. The \"chills and fever,\" \"fevernager,\"\r\n\"mylary,\" that chattered the teeth and racked the joints of the pioneer,\r\nfrom Michigan to Mississippi, was one and the same plague with the\r\ndeadly \"jungle fever,\" \"African fever,\" \"black fever\" of the tropics,\r\nfrom Panama to Singapore. Hardly a generation ago, along the advancing\r\nfront of civilization in the Middle West, the whole life of the\r\ncommunity was colored with a malarial tinge and the taste of quinine\r\nwas as familiar as that of sugar. To this day, over something like\r\nthree-quarters of the area of these United States, the South, Middle\r\nWest, and Far West, if you feel headachy and bilious and \"run down,\" you\r\nsum it all up by saying that you are feeling \"malarious.\" Dwellers upon\r\nthe rich bottom-lands expected to shake every spring and fall with\r\nalmost the same regularity as they put on and shed their winter\r\nclothing. Readers of Frank Stockton will remember the gales of merriment\r\nexcited by his quaint touch of the incongruous in making the prospective\r\nbridegroom of the immortal Pomona change the date of their wedding day\r\nfrom Tuesday to Monday, because, on figuring the matter out, he had\r\ndiscovered that Tuesday was his \"chill-day.\"\r\n\r\nThough the sufferer from ague seldom received very much sympathy at the\r\ntime, but was considered a fair butt for genial ridicule and chaff, yet\r\neven there the trouble had its serious side. Through all those\r\ncommunities there stalked a well-known and dreaded spectre, the\r\nso-called \"congestive chill,\" what is now known in technical language as\r\nthe pernicious malarial paroxysm. These were like the three warnings of\r\ndeath in the old parable. You would probably survive the first and might\r\nnever have another; but if you had your second, it was considered\r\nequivalent to a notice to quit the country promptly and without counting\r\nthe cost. In my boyhood days in the Middle West, I can recall hearing\r\nold pioneers tell of little groups of one or more families moving out on\r\nto some particularly rich and virgin bottom-land and losing two or\r\nthree or more members out of each family by congestive chills within\r\nthe first year, and in some cases being driven in from the outpost and\r\nback to civilization by the fearful death-loss.\r\n\r\nA pall of dread hangs over the whole west coast of Africa. The factories\r\nand trading-posts are haunted by the ghosts of former agents and\r\nexplorers who have died there. Some years ago one German company had the\r\nsinister record that of its hundreds of agents sent out to the Gold\r\nCoast under a three years' contract, not one had fulfilled the term! All\r\nhad either died, or been invalided and returned home. It was malaria\r\nmore than any other five influences combined that thwarted the French in\r\ntheir attempt to dig the Panama Canal and that made the Panama Railroad\r\nbear the ghastly stigma of having built its forty miles of track with a\r\nhuman body for every tie.\r\n\r\nMalaria ever has been, and is yet, the great barrier against the\r\ninvasion of the tropics by the white races; nor has its injurious\r\ninfluence been confined to the deaths that it causes, for these gaps in\r\nthe fighting line might be filled by fresh levies drawn from the\r\nwholesome North. Its fearfully depressing and degenerating effects upon\r\neven those who recover from its attacks have been still more injurious.\r\nIt has been held by careful students of tropical disease and conditions\r\nthat no small part of that singular apathy and indifference which steal\r\nover the mind and body of the white colonist in the tropics, numbing\r\neven his moral sense, and alternating with furious outbursts of what the\r\nFrench have termed \"tropical wrath,\" characterized by unnatural cruelty\r\nand abnormal disregard for the rights of others, is the deadly work\r\nof malaria. It is the most powerful cause, not merely of the\r\nextinction of the white colonist in the tropics, but of the peculiar\r\ndegeneracy--physical, mental, and moral--which is apt to steal over even\r\nthe survivors who succeed in retaining a foothold. Two particularly\r\ningenious investigators have even advanced the theory that the\r\nimportation of malaria into the islands of Greece and the Italian\r\npeninsula by soldiers returning from African and Southern Asiatic\r\nconquests had much to do with accelerating, if not actually promoting,\r\nthe classic decay of both of these superb civilizations.\r\n\r\nTo come nearer home, there can be little question that the baneful,\r\npersistent influence of malaria, together with the hookworm disease, has\r\nhad much to do both with the degeneracy of the Southern \"cracker,\" or\r\n\"mean white,\" and with those wild outbursts of primitive ferocity in all\r\nclasses which take the form of White Cap raids and lynching mobs.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the disease and the colonization habit brought in a\r\ncrude way their own remedy. The Spanish conquerors of Peru were told by\r\nthe natives that a certain bark which grew upon the slopes of the Andes\r\nwas a sovereign remedy for those terrible ague seizures. Indian remedies\r\ndid not stand as high in popular esteem as they do now; but they were in\r\ndesperate straits and jumped at the chance. To their delight, it proved\r\na positive specific, and a Spanish lady of rank, the Countess Chincona,\r\nwas so delighted with her own recovery that she carried back a package\r\nof the precious Peruvian bark on her return to Europe, and endeavored to\r\nintroduce it. So furious was the opposition of the Church, however, to\r\nthis \"pagan\" remedy that she was completely defeated in her praiseworthy\r\nattempt and was obliged to confine her ministrations to those who\r\nbelonged to her, the peasantry on her own estate. About half a century\r\nlater, the new remedy excited so much discussion by the numerous cures\r\nthat it effected, that it was considered worthy of a special council of\r\nthe Jesuits, who formally pronounced it suitable for the use of the\r\nfaithful, thereby attaching to it for many years the name of \"Jesuit's\r\nbark.\" Virtue, however, is sometimes rewarded in this world, and the\r\ndevoted and enlightened countess has, all unknown to herself, attained\r\nimmortality by attaching her name, Chincona, softened into _cinchona_,\r\nand hardened into _quinine_, to the greatest therapeutic gift of the\r\ngods to mankind. It is not too much to say that the modern colonization\r\nof the tropics and subtropics by Northern races, which is one of the\r\ngreatest and most significant triumphs of our civilization, would have\r\nbeen almost impossible without it. Its advance depended upon two\r\npowders, one white and the other black,--quinine and gunpowder.\r\n\r\nFor nearly three centuries we rested content with the knowledge that in\r\nquinine we had a remedy for malaria, which, if administered at the\r\nproper time and in adequate doses, would break up and cure ninety per\r\ncent of all cases. Just how it did it we were utterly in the dark, and\r\nmany were the speculations that were indulged in. It was not until\r\n1880, that Laveran, a French army surgeon stationed in Algeria,\r\nannounced the discovery in the blood of malarial patients of an organism\r\nwhich at first bore his name, the _Hematozoon-Laveran_, now known as the\r\n_Plasmodium malariæ_. This organism, of all curious places, burrowed\r\ninto and found a home in the little red corpuscles of the blood. At\r\nperiods of forty-eight hours it ripened a crop of spores, and would\r\nburst out of the corpuscles, scattering throughout the blood and the\r\ntissues of the body, and producing the famous paroxysm. This accounted\r\nfor the most curious and well-marked feature of the disease, namely, its\r\nintermittent character, chill and fever one day, and then a day of\r\ncomparative health, followed by another chill day and so on, as long as\r\nthe infection continued. One problem, however, was left open, and that\r\nwas why certain forms of the disease had their chills every fourth day\r\nand so were called _quartan_ ague. This was quickly solved by the\r\ndiscovery of another form of the organism, which ripened its spores in\r\nthree days instead of two. So the whole curious rhythm of the disease\r\nwas established by the rate of breeding or ripening of the spores of the\r\norganism. Later still another form was discovered, which had no such\r\nregular period of incubation and gave rise to the so-called irregular,\r\nor _autumnal_, malarial fevers. That form of the fever which had a\r\nparoxysm every day, the classic _quotidian_ ague, remained a puzzle for\r\na little longer, but was finally discovered to be due chiefly to the\r\npresence of two broods, or infections, of the organism, which ripened\r\non alternate days and hence kept the entire time of the unfortunate\r\npatient occupied.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the remedial effect of quinine was also solved, as it was\r\nfound that, if administered at the time which centuries of experience\r\nhas shown us to be the most effective, between or shortly before the\r\nparoxysms, it either prevented sporulation or killed the spores. So that\r\nat one triumphant stroke the mystery of centuries was cleared up.\r\n\r\nBut here will challenge some twentieth-century _Gradgrind_: \"This is all\r\nvery pretty from the point of view of abstract science, but what is the\r\npractical value of it? The discovery of the plasmodium and its\r\npeculiarities has merely shown us the how and the why of a fact that we\r\nhad known well and utilized for centuries, namely, that quinine will\r\ncure malaria.\" Just listen to what follows. The story of the plasmodium\r\nis one of the most beautiful illustrations of the fact that there is no\r\nsuch thing as useless or unpractical knowledge. The only thing that\r\nmakes any knowledge unpractical is our more or less temporary ignorance\r\nof how to apply it. The first question which instantly raised itself\r\nwas, \"How did the plasmodium get into human blood?\" The very\r\nsickle-shape of the plasmodium turned itself into an interrogation mark.\r\nThe first clew that was given was the new and interesting one that this\r\norganism was a new departure in the germ line in that it was an animal,\r\ninstead of a plant, like all the other hitherto known bacilli, bacteria,\r\nand other disease-germs.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in passing that its discovery had another incidental\r\npractical lesson of enormous value, and that was that it paved the way\r\nfor the identification of a whole class of animal parasites causing\r\ninfectious diseases, which already includes the organisms of Texas fever\r\nin cattle, dourine in horses, the _tsetse_ fly disease, the dreaded\r\nsleeping sickness, and finally such world-renowned plagues as syphilis\r\nand perhaps smallpox.\r\n\r\nBeing an animal, the plasmodium naturally would not grow upon\r\nculture-media like the vegetable bacilli and bacteria, and this very\r\nfact had delayed its recognition, but raised at once the probability\r\nthat it must be conveyed into the human body by some other animal.\r\nObviously, the only animals that bite our human species with sufficient\r\nfrequency and regularity to act as transmitters of such a common disease\r\nare those Ishmaelites of the animal world, the insects. As all the\r\nevidence pointed toward malaria being contracted in the open air,\r\nattested by its popular though unscientific name _mal-aria_, \"bad air,\"\r\nand as of all forms of \"bad air\" the night air was incomparably the\r\nworst, it must be some insect which flew and bit by night; which by\r\nSherlock Holmes's process promptly led the mosquito into the dock as the\r\nsuspected criminal. It wasn't long before he was, in the immortal\r\nlanguage of Mr. Devery, \"caught with the goods on\"; and in 1895 Dr.\r\nRonald Ross, of the Indian Medical Service, discovered and positively\r\nidentified the plasmodium undergoing a cycle of its development in the\r\nbody of the mosquito. He attempted to communicate the disease to birds\r\nand animals by allowing infected mosquitoes to bite them, but was\r\nunsuccessful. Two Italian investigators, Bignami and Grassi, saw that\r\nthe problem was one for human experiment and that nothing less would\r\nsolve it. Volunteers were called for and promptly offered themselves.\r\nTheir blood was carefully examined to make sure that they were not\r\nsuffering from any latent form of malaria. They then allowed themselves\r\nto be bitten by infected mosquitoes, and within periods varying from six\r\nto ten days, eight-tenths of them developed the disease. It may be some\r\nconsolation to our national pride to know that although the organism was\r\nfirst identified in the mosquito by an Englishman and its transmission\r\nto human beings in its bite by Italians, the first definite and\r\ncarefully worked-out statement of the relation of the mosquito to\r\nmalaria was made by an American, King of Washington, in 1882; though it\r\nis only fair to say that suggestions of the possible connection between\r\nmosquitoes and malaria had, so to speak, been in the air and been made\r\nfrom scores of different sources, from the age of Augustus onward.\r\n\r\nAnother mystery was solved--and what a flood of light it did pour upon\r\nour speculations as to the how and wherefore of the catching of malaria!\r\nIn some respects it curiously corroborated and increased our respect for\r\npopular beliefs and impressions. While \"bad air\" had nothing to do with\r\ncausing the disease, except in so far as it was inhabited by songsters\r\nof the _Anopheles_ genus, yet it was precisely the air of marshy places\r\nwhich was most likely to be \"bad\" in this sense. So that, while in one\r\nsense those local wiseacres, who would point out to you the pearly mists\r\nof evening as they rose over low-lying meadows and bottom-lands, and\r\ninform you that there before your very eyes was the \"mylary just\r\na-risin' out of the ground,\" were ludicrously mistaken, in another their\r\npractical conclusion was absolutely sound; for it is in just such air,\r\nat such levels above the surface of the water, that the _Anopheles_ most\r\ndelights to disport himself. Furthermore, while all raw or misty air is\r\n\"bad,\" the night air is infinitely more so than that of the day, because\r\nthis is the time at which mosquitoes are chiefly abroad. In fact, there\r\ncan be little doubt that this is part of the foundation for that rabid\r\nand unreasonable dread of the night air which we fresh-air crusaders\r\nfind the bitterest and most tenacious foe we have to fight. We have\r\nliterally discovered the Powers of Darkness in both visible and audible\r\nform, and they have wings and bite, just like the vampire.\r\n\r\nIt was also a widespread belief in malarial regions that the hours when\r\nyou are most likely to \"git mylary inter yer system\" were those just\r\nbefore and just after sundown; and now entomologists inform us that\r\nthese are precisely the hours at which the _Anopheles_ mosquito, the\r\nonly genus that carries malaria, flies abroad.\r\n\r\nOf course, a number of popular causes, such as bad drainage, the\r\ndrinking of water from shallow surface wells, damp subsoils under the\r\nhouses, and especially that peculiarly widespread and firmly held\r\narticle of belief that new settlements, where large areas of prairie sod\r\nwere being freshly upturned by the plough, were peculiarly liable to\r\nthe attack and spread of malaria, had to go by the board,--with this\r\nimportant reservation, however, that almost every one of these alleged\r\ncauses either implied or was pretty safe to be associated with pools or\r\nswamps of stagnant water in the neighborhood, which would furnish\r\nbreeding-spots for the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe discovery explains at once a score of hitherto puzzling facts as to\r\nthe distribution of malaria. Why, for instance, in all tropical or other\r\nmalarious countries, those who slept in second and third story bedrooms\r\nwere less likely to contract the disease, supposedly because \"bad air\r\ndidn't rise to that height,\" is clearly seen to be due to the fact that\r\nthe mosquito seldom flies more than ten or twelve feet above the level\r\nof the ground or marsh in which he breeds, except when swept by\r\nprevailing winds. It also explained why in our Western and Southwestern\r\nstates the inhabitants of the houses situated on the south bank of a\r\nriver, though but a short distance back from the stream, would suffer\r\nvery slightly from malaria, while those living upon the north bank, half\r\na mile back, or even upon bluffs fifteen or twenty feet above the water\r\nlevel, were simply plagued with it. The prevailing winds during the\r\nsummer are from the south and mosquitoes cannot fly a foot against the\r\nwind, but will fly hundreds of yards, and even the best part of a mile,\r\nwith it. The well-known seasonal preference of the disease for warm\r\nspring and summer months, and its prompt subsidence after a killing\r\nfrost, were seen simply to be due to the influence of the weather upon\r\nthe flight of mosquitoes. Shakespeare's favorite reference to \"the sun\r\nof March that breedeth agues\" has been placed upon a solid entomological\r\nbasis by the discovery that, like his pious little brother insect, the\r\nbee, the one converted and church-going member of a large criminal\r\nfamily, the mosquito hies himself abroad on his affairs at the very\r\nfirst gleam of spring sunshine, and will even reappear upon a warm,\r\nsunny day in November or December. Perhaps even some of the popular\r\nprejudice against \"unseasonable weather\" in winter may be traceable to\r\nthis fact.\r\n\r\nGranted that mosquitoes do cause and are the only cause of malaria, what\r\nare you going to do about it? At first sight any campaign against\r\nmalaria which involves the extermination of the mosquito would appear\r\nabout as hopeless as Mrs. Partington's attempt to sweep back the rising\r\nAtlantic tide with her broom. But a little further investigation showed\r\nthat it is not only within the limits of possibility, but perfectly\r\nfeasible, to exterminate malaria absolutely from the mosquito end. In\r\nthe first place, it was quickly found that by a most merciful\r\nsqueamishness on the part of the plasmodium, it could live only in the\r\njuices of one particular genus of mosquito, the _Anopheles_; and as\r\nnowhere, not even in the most benighted regions of Jersey, has this\r\ngenus been found to form more than about four or five per cent of the\r\ntotal mosquito population, this cuts down our problem to one-twentieth\r\nof its apparent original dimensions at once. The ordinary mosquito of\r\ncommerce (known as _Culex_) is any number of different kinds of a\r\nnuisance, but she does not carry malaria.\r\n\r\nHere the trails of the extermination party fork, one of them taking the\r\nperfectly obvious but rather troublesome direction of protecting houses\r\nand particularly bedrooms with suitable screens and keeping the\r\ninhabitants safely behind them from about an hour before sundown on. By\r\nthis simple method alone, parties of explorers, of campers, of\r\nrailroad-builders going through swamps, of the laborers on our Panama\r\nCanal, have been enabled to live for weeks and months in the most\r\nmalarious regions with perfect impunity, so long as these precautions\r\nwere strictly observed. The first experiment of this sort was carried\r\nout by Bignami upon a group of laborers in the famous, or rather\r\ninfamous, Roman Campagna, whose deadly malarial fevers have a classic\r\nreputation, and has achieved its latest triumphs in the superb success\r\nof Colonel Gorgas at Panama. While this procedure should never be\r\nneglected, it is obvious that it involves a good deal of irksome\r\nconfinement and interferes with freedom of movement, and it will\r\nprobably be carried out completely only under military or official\r\ndiscipline, or in tropical regions where the risks are so great that its\r\nobservance is literally a matter of life or death.\r\n\r\nThe other division of malaria-hunters pursued the trail of the\r\n_Anopheles_ to her lair. There they discovered facts which give us\r\npractically the whip-hand over malarial and other tropical fevers\r\nwhenever we choose to exercise it. It had long been known that the\r\nbreeding-place of mosquitoes was in water; that their eggs when\r\ndeposited in water floated upon the surface like tiny boats, usually\r\nglued together into a raft; that they then turned into larvæ, of which\r\nthe well-known \"wigglers\" in the water-butt or the rain-barrel are\r\nfamiliar examples; and that they finally hatched into the complete\r\ninsect and rose into the air.\r\n\r\nObviously, there were two points at which the destroyers might strike,\r\nthe egg and the larvæ. It was first found that, while the eggs required\r\nno air for their development, the larvæ wiggled up to the surface and\r\ninhaled it through curious little tubes developed for this purpose,\r\noddly enough from their tail-ends. If some kind of film could be spread\r\nover the surface of the water, through which the larvæ could not obtain\r\nair, they would suffocate. The well-known property of oil in \"scumming\r\nover\" water was recalled, two or three stagnant pools were treated with\r\nit, and to the delight of the experimenters, not a single larva was able\r\nto develop under the circumstances. Here was insecticide number one. The\r\ncheapest of oils, crude petroleum, if applied to the pool or marsh in\r\nwhich mosquitoes breed, will almost completely exterminate them. Scores\r\nof regions and areas to-day, which were once almost uninhabitable on\r\naccount of the plague of mosquitoes, are now nearly completely free from\r\nthese pests by this simple means. An ounce to each fifteen square feet\r\nof water-surface is all that is required, though the oiling needs to be\r\nrepeated carefully several times during the season.\r\n\r\nBut what of the eggs? They require no air, and it was found impossible\r\nto poison them without simply saturating the water with powerful\r\npoisons; but an unexpected ally was at our hand. It was early noted that\r\nmosquitoes would not breed freely in open rivers or in large ponds or\r\nlakes, but why this should be the case was a puzzle. One day an\r\nenthusiastic mosquito-student brought home a number of eggs of different\r\nspecies, which he had collected from the neighboring marshes, and put\r\nthem into his laboratory aquarium for the sake of watching them develop\r\nand identifying their species. The next morning, when he went to look at\r\nthem, they had totally disappeared. Thinking that perhaps the laboratory\r\ncat had taken them, and overlooking a most contented twinkle in the\r\ncorner of the eyes of the minnows that inhabited the aquarium, he went\r\nout and collected another series. This time the minnows were ready for\r\nhim, and before his astonished eyes promptly pounced on the raft of eggs\r\nand swallowed them whole. Here was the answer at once: mosquitoes would\r\nnot develop freely where fish had free access; and this fact is our\r\nsecond most important weapon in the crusade for their extermination. If\r\nthe pond be large enough, all that is necessary is simply to stock it\r\nwith any of the local fish, minnows, killies, perch, dace, bass,--and\r\npresto! the mosquitoes practically disappear. If it be near some larger\r\nlake or river containing fish, then a channel connecting the two, to\r\nallow of its stocking, is all that is required.\r\n\r\nOn the Hackensack marshes to-day trenches are cut to let the water out\r\nof the tidal pools; while in low-lying areas, which cannot be thus\r\ndrained, the central lowest spot is selected, a barrel is sunk at this\r\nspot, and four or five \"killie\" fish are placed in it. Trenches are cut\r\nconverging into this barrel from the whole of the area to be drained,\r\nand behold, no more mosquitoes can breed in that area, and, in the\r\nlanguage of the day, \"get away with it.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, most consoling of all, it was discovered that, while the\r\nordinary _Culex_ mosquito can breed, going through all the stages from\r\nthe egg to the complete insect, in about fourteen days, so that any\r\npuddle which will remain wet for that length of time, or even such\r\nexceedingly temporary collections of water as the rain caught in a\r\ntomato-can, in an old rubber boot, in broken crockery, etc., will serve\r\nher for a breeding-place, the _Anopheles_ on the other hand takes nearly\r\nthree months for the completion of her development. So that, while a\r\nregion might be simply swarming with ordinary mosquitoes, it would\r\nfrequently be found that the only places which fulfilled all the\r\nrequirements for breeding-homes for the _Anopheles_, that is, isolation\r\nfrom running water or larger streams, absence of fish, and persistence\r\nfor at least three months continuously, would not exceed five or six to\r\nthe square mile. Drain, fill up, or kerosene these puddles,--for they\r\nare often little more than that,--and you put a stop to the malarial\r\ninfection of that particular region. Incredible as it may seem, places\r\nin such a hotbed of fevers as the west coast of Africa, which have been\r\nthoroughly investigated, drained, and cleaned up by mosquito-brigades,\r\nhave actually been freed from further attacks of fever by draining and\r\nfilling not to exceed twenty or thirty of these breeding-pools.\r\n\r\nIn short, science is prepared to say to the community: \"I have done my\r\npart in the problem of malaria. It is for you to do the rest.\" There is\r\nliterally no neighborhood in the temperate zone, and exceedingly few in\r\nthe tropics, which cannot, by intelligent coöperation and a moderate\r\nexpense, be absolutely rid first of malaria, and second of all\r\nmosquito-pests. It is only a question of intelligence, coöperation, and\r\nmoney. The range of flight of the ordinary mosquito is seldom over two\r\nor three hundred yards, save when blown by the wind, and more commonly\r\nnot more than as many feet, and thorough investigation of the ground\r\nwithin the radius of a quarter of a mile of your house will practically\r\ndisclose all the danger you have to apprehend from mosquitoes. It is a\r\ngood thing to begin with your own back yard, including the water-butt,\r\nany puddles or open cesspools or cisterns, and any ornamental water\r\ngardens or lily-ponds. These latter should be stocked with fish or\r\nslightly oiled occasionally. If there be any accumulations of water,\r\nlike rain-barrels or cisterns, which cannot be abolished, they should\r\neither be kept closely covered or well screened with mosquito netting.\r\n\r\nIt might be remarked incidentally in passing, that the only really\r\ndangerous sex in mosquitodom, as elsewhere, is the female. The male\r\nmosquito, if he were taxed with transmitting malaria, would have a\r\nchance to reëcho Adam's cowardly evasion in the Garden of Eden, \"It was\r\nthe woman that thou gavest me.\" Both sexes of mosquitoes under ordinary\r\nconditions are vegetable feeders, living upon the juices of plants. But\r\nwhen the female has thrown upon her the tremendous task of ripening and\r\npreparing her eggs for deposition, she requires a meal of blood--which\r\nmay be a comfort to our vegetarian friends, or it may not. Either she\r\nrequires a meal of blood to nerve her up to her criminal deed, or, when\r\nshe has some real work to do, she has to have some real food.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito-brigade have still another method of checking the spread of\r\nmalaria, at first sight almost a whimsical one,--no less than screening\r\nthe patient. The mosquito, of course, criminal as she is, does not hatch\r\nthe parasites _de novo_ in her own body, but simply sucks them up in a\r\nmeal of blood from some previous victim. Hence by careful screening of\r\nevery known case of malaria, mosquitoes are prevented from becoming\r\ninfected and transmitting the disease. Instead of the screens protecting\r\nthe victims from the mosquitoes, they protect the mosquitoes against the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nThis explains why hunters, trappers, and Indians may range a region for\r\nyears, without once suffering from malaria, while as soon as settlers\r\nbegin to come in in considerable numbers, it becomes highly malarious.\r\nIt had to be infected by the coming of a case of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe notorious prevalence of malaria on the frontier is due to the\r\nintroduction of the plasmodium into a region swarming with mosquitoes,\r\nwhere there are few window-screens or two-story houses.\r\n\r\nNo known race has any real immunity against malaria. The negro and other\r\ncolored races, it is true, are far less susceptible; but this we now\r\nknow applies only to adults, as the studies of Koch in Africa showed\r\nthat a large percentage of negro children had the plasmodium in their\r\nblood. No small percentage of them die of malaria, but those who recover\r\nacquire a certain degree of immunity. Possibly they may be able to\r\nacquire this immunity more easily and with less fatality than the white\r\nrace, but this is the extent of their superiority in this regard. The\r\nnegro races probably represent the survivors of primitive men, who were\r\ntoo unenterprising to get away from the tropics, and have had to adjust\r\nthemselves as best they might.\r\n\r\nThe serious injury wrought in the body by malaria is a household word,\r\nand a matter of painfully familiar experience. Scarcely an organ in the\r\nbody escapes damage, though this may not be discovered till long after\r\nthe \"fever-and-ague\" has been recovered from.\r\n\r\nAs the parasite breeds in the red cells of the blood, naturally its\r\nfirst effect is to destroy huge numbers of these, producing the typical\r\nmalarial _anæmia_, or bloodlessness. Instead of 5,000,000 to the cubic\r\ncentimetre of blood the red cells may be reduced to 2,000,000 or even\r\n1,500,000. The breaking down of these red cells throws their pigment or\r\ncoloring-matter afloat in the blood; and soaking through all the tissues\r\nof the body, this turns a greenish-yellow and gives the well-known\r\nsallow skin and yellowish whites of the eyes of swamp-dwellers and\r\n\"river-rats.\"\r\n\r\nThe broken-down scraps of the red blood-cells, together with the toxins\r\nof the parasite, are carried to the liver and spleen to be burned up or\r\npurified in such quantities that both become congested and diseased,\r\ncausing the familiar \"biliousness,\" so characteristic of malaria.\r\n\r\nThe spleen often becomes so enormously enlarged that it can be readily\r\nfelt with the hand in the left side below the ribs, so that it is not\r\nonly relied upon as a sign of malaria in doubtful cases, but has even\r\nreceived the popular name of the \"ague-cake\" in malarious districts.\r\n\r\nSo full is the blood of the parasites, that they may actually choke up\r\nthe tiny blood-vessels and capillaries in various organs, so as to block\r\nthe circulation and cause serious and even fatal congestions.\r\nObstructions of this sort may occur in the brain, the liver, the coats\r\nof the stomach, or intestines, and the kidneys; and they are the chief\r\ncause of the deadly \"congestive chills,\" or pernicious malarial\r\nparoxysms, which we have alluded to.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are particularly liable to be attacked in this way; indeed,\r\none of their involvements is so serious and fatal in the tropics as to\r\nhave been given a separate name, \"Blackwater fever,\" from the quantities\r\nof broken-down blood which appear in and blacken the urine.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of attacks of malaria are completely recovered from,\r\nlike any other infection, but it can easily be seen what an injurious\r\neffect upon the system may be produced by successive attacks, keeping\r\nthe entire body saturated with the poison; while there is serious risk\r\nof the parasite sooner or later finding some weak spot in the\r\nbody,--kidney, liver, nervous system,--where its incessant battering\r\nworks permanent damage.\r\n\r\nHow long the infection may lurk in the body is uncertain; certainly for\r\nmonths, and possibly for years. Many cases are on record which had\r\ntypical chills and fever, with abundance of plasmodia in the blood,\r\nyears after leaving the tropics or other malarious districts; but there\r\nis often the possibility of a recent re-infection.\r\n\r\nAltogether, malaria is a remarkably bad citizen in any community, and\r\nits stamping-out is well worth all it costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM: WHAT IT IS, AND PARTICULARLY WHAT IT ISN'T\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's in a name? All the aches and pains that came out of Pandora's\r\nbox, if the name happens to be rheumatism. It is a term of wondrous\r\nelasticity. It will cover every imaginable twinge in any and every\r\nregion of the body--and explain none of them. It is a name that means\r\njust nothing, and yet it is in every man's vocabulary, from proudest\r\nprince to dullest peasant. Its derivative meaning is little short of an\r\nabsurdity in its inappropriateness, from the Greek _reuma_ (a flowing),\r\nhence, a cold or catarrh. It is still preserved for us in the familiar\r\n\"salt rheum\" (eczema) and \"rheum of the eyes\" of our rural districts.\r\nBut this very indefiniteness, absurdity if you will, is a comfort both\r\nto the sufferer and to the physician. Moreover, incidentally, to\r\nparaphrase Portia's famous plea,--\r\n\r\n  It blesseth him that _has_ and him that _treats_;\r\n  'T is mightier than the mightiest.\r\n  It doth _fit_ the thronéd monarch _closer_ than his crown.\r\n\r\nTo the patient it is a satisfying diagnosis and satisfactory explanation\r\nin one; to the doctor, a great saving of brain-fag. When we call a\r\ndisease rheumatism, we know what to give for it--even if we don't know\r\nwhat it is. As the old German distich runs,--\r\n\r\n  Was man kann nicht erkennen,\r\n  Muss er Rheumatismus nennen.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: What one cannot recognize he must call rheumatism.]\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of the confusion produced by this wholesale and\r\nindiscriminate application of the term to a host of widely different,\r\npainful conditions, many of which have little else in common save that\r\nthey hurt and can be covered by this charitable name-blanket, a few\r\ndefinite facts are crystallizing here and there out of the chaos. The\r\nfirst is, that out of this swarm of different conditions there can be\r\nisolated one large and important central group which has the characters\r\nof a well-defined and constant disease-entity. This is the disease known\r\npopularly as rheumatic fever, and technically as acute rheumatism or\r\nacute articular rheumatism. In fact, the commonest division is to\r\nseparate the \"rheumatisms\" into two great groups: acute, covering the\r\n\"fever\" form, and chronic, containing all the others. From a purely\r\nscientific point of view, this classification has rather an undesirable\r\ndegree of resemblance to General Grant's famous division of all music\r\ninto two tunes: one of which was Old Hundred, and the other wasn't. But\r\nfor practical purposes it has certain merits and may pass.\r\n\r\nEvery one has seen, or known, or had, the acute articular form of\r\nrheumatism, and when once seen there is no difficulty in recognizing it\r\nagain. It is one of the most striking and most abominable of\r\ndisease-pictures, beginning with high fever and headache, then\r\ntenderness, quickly increasing to extreme sensitiveness in one or more\r\nof the larger joints, followed by drenching sweats of penetrating acid\r\nodor. The joint attacked becomes red, swollen, and glossy, so tender\r\nthat merely pointing a finger at it will send a twinge of agony through\r\nthe entire body, and the patient lies rigid and cramped for fear of the\r\nagony caused by the slightest movement. The tongue becomes coated and\r\nfoul, the blood-cells are rapidly broken down, and the victim becomes\r\nashy pale. He is worn out with pain and fever, yet afraid to fall asleep\r\nfor fear of unconsciously moving the inflamed joint and waking in\r\ntortures; and altogether is about as acutely uncomfortable and\r\ncompletely miserable as any human being can well be made in so short a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as with its twin brother, the grip, the bark of rheumatism\r\nis far worse than its bite; and a striking feature of the disease is its\r\nlow fatality, especially when contrasted with the fury of its onslaught\r\nand the profoundness of the prostration which it produces. Though it\r\nwill torture its victim almost to the limits of his endurance for days\r\nand even weeks at a stretch, it seldom kills directly. Its chief danger\r\nlies in the legacies which it bequeaths. Though, like nearly all fevers,\r\nit is self-limited, tends to run its course and subside when the body\r\nhas manufactured an antitoxin in sufficient amounts, it is unique in\r\nanother respect, and that is in the extraordinary variability of the\r\nlength of its \"course.\" This may range anywhere from ten days to as many\r\nweeks, the \"average expectation of life\" being about six weeks. The\r\nagonizing intensity of the pain and acute edge of the discomfort usually\r\nsubside in from five to fifteen days, especially under competent care.\r\nWhen the temperature falls, the drenching sweats cease, the joints\r\nbecome less exquisitely painful, and the patient gradually begins to\r\npull himself together and to feel as if life were once more worth\r\nliving. He is not yet out of the woods, however, for while the pain is\r\nsubsiding in the joints which have been first attacked, another joint\r\nmay suddenly flare up within ten or twelve hours, and the whole\r\ndistressing process be repeated, though usually on a somewhat milder and\r\nshorter scale. This uncertainty as to how many joints in the body may be\r\nattacked, is, in fact, one of the chief elements in making the duration\r\nof the disease so irregular and incalculable.\r\n\r\nEven when the frank and open progress of the disease through the joints\r\nof the body has come to an end, the enemy is still lying in wait and\r\nreserving his most deadly assault. Distressing and crippling as are the\r\neffects of rheumatism upon the joints and tendons, its most deadly and\r\npermanent damage is wrought upon the heart. Fortunately, this vital\r\norgan is not attacked in more than about half the cases of acute\r\nrheumatism, and in probably not more than one-third of these are the\r\nchanges produced either serious or permanent, especially if the case be\r\ncarefully watched and managed. But it is not too much to say that, of\r\nall cases of serious or \"organic\" heart disease, rheumatism is probably\r\nresponsible for from fifty to seventy per cent. The same germ or toxin\r\nwhich produces the striking inflammatory changes in the joints may be\r\ncarried in the blood to the heart, and there attack either the lining\r\nand valves of the heart (endocardium), which is commonest, or the\r\ncovering of the heart (pericardium), or the heart-muscle. So intense is\r\nthe inflammation, that parts of the valves may be literally eaten away\r\nby ulceration, and when these ulcers heal with formation of scar-tissue\r\nas everywhere else in the body, the flaps of the valves may be either\r\ntied together or pulled out of shape, so that they can no longer\r\nproperly close the openings of the heart-pump. This condition, or some\r\nmodification of it, is what we usually mean when we speak of \"heart\r\ndisease,\" or \"organic heart disease.\" The effect upon the heart-pump is\r\nsimilar to that which would be produced by cutting or twisting the valve\r\nin the \"bucket\" of a pump or in a bulb syringe.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of rheumatism the heart may be attacked within the first\r\nfew days of the disease, but usually it is not involved until after the\r\ntrouble in the joints has begun to subside; and no patient should be\r\nconsidered safe from this danger until at least six weeks have elapsed\r\nfrom the beginning of the fever. The few cases (not to exceed one or two\r\nper cent) of rheumatic fever which go rapidly on to a fatal termination,\r\nusually die from this inflammation of the heart, technically known as\r\nendocarditis. The best way of preventing this serious complication and\r\nof keeping it within moderate limits, if it occurs, is absolute rest in\r\nbed, until the danger period is completely passed.\r\n\r\nNow comes another redeeming feature of this troublesome disease, and\r\nthat is the comparatively small permanent effects which it produces upon\r\nthe joints in the way of crippling, or even stiffening. To gaze upon a\r\nrheumatic knee-joint, for instance, in the height of the\r\nattack,--swollen to the size of a hornet's nest, hot, red, throbbing\r\nwith agony, and looking as if it were on the point of bursting,--one\r\nwould almost despair of saving the joint, and the best one would feel\r\nentitled to expect would be a roughening of its surfaces and a permanent\r\nstiffening of its movements.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, when once the fury of the attack has passed its climax,\r\nespecially if another joint should become involved, the whole picture\r\nchanges as if by magic. The pain fades away to one-fifth of its former\r\nintensity within twenty-four, or even within twelve hours; three-fourths\r\nof the swelling follows suit in forty-eight hours; and within three or\r\nfour days' time the patient is moving the joint with comparative ease\r\nand comfort. After he gets up at the end of his six weeks, the knee,\r\nthough still weak and stiff and sore, within a few weeks' time \"limbers\r\nup\" completely, and usually becomes practically as good as ever. In\r\nshort, the violence and swiftness of the onset are only matched by the\r\nrapidity and completeness of the retreat. It would probably be safe to\r\nsay that not more than one joint in fifty, attacked by rheumatism, is\r\nleft in any way permanently the worse.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! to counterbalance this mercifulness in the matter of\r\npermanent damage, unlike most other infections, one attack of rheumatic\r\nfever, so far from protecting against another, renders both the\r\nindividual and the joint more liable to other attacks. The historic\r\nmotto of the British in the War of 1812 might be paraphrased into,\r\n\"Once rheumatic, always rheumatic.\" The disease appears to be lost to\r\nall sense of decency and reason; and to such unprincipled lengths may it\r\ngo, that I have actually known one luckless individual who had the\r\nunenviable record of seventeen separate and successive attacks of\r\nrheumatic fever. As he expressed it, he had \"had rheumatism every spring\r\nbut two for nineteen years past.\" Yet only one ankle-joint was\r\nappreciably the worse for this terrific experience.\r\n\r\nObviously, the picture of acute rheumatism carries upon its face a\r\nstrong suggestion of its real nature and causation. The high\r\ntemperature, the headache, the sweats, the fierce attack and rapid\r\ndecline, the self-limited course, the tendency to spread from one joint\r\nto another, from the joints to the heart, from the heart to the lungs\r\nand the kidneys, all stamp it unmistakably as an infection, a fever. On\r\nthe other hand, there are two rather important elements lacking in the\r\ninfection-picture: one, that, although it does at times occur in\r\nepidemics, it is very seldom transmitted to others; the other, that one\r\nattack does not produce immunity or protect against another. The\r\nmajority of experts are now practically agreed that _acute_ rheumatism,\r\nor _rheumatic fever_, is probably due to the invasion of the system by\r\nsome microörganism or germ. When, however, we come to fixing upon the\r\nparticular bacillus, or micrococcus, there is a wide divergence of\r\nopinion, some six or seven different eminent investigators having each\r\nhis favorite candidate for the doubtful honor. In fact, it is our\r\ninability as yet positively to identify and agree upon the causal germ\r\nthat makes our knowledge of the entire subject still so regrettably\r\nvague, and renders either a definite classification or successful\r\ntreatment so difficult.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the most careful and experienced physicians and\r\nbroad-minded bacteriologists may be roughly summed up in the statement\r\nthat acute rheumatism is probably due to some germ or germs, but that\r\nthe question is still open which particular germ is at fault, and even\r\nwhether the group of symptoms which we call rheumatism may not possibly\r\nbe produced by a number of different organisms, acting upon a particular\r\ntype of constitution or susceptibility. There is no difficulty in\r\nfinding germs of all sorts, principally micrococci, in the blood, in the\r\ntissues about the joints, and on the heart-valves of patients with\r\nrheumatism, and these germs, when injected into animals, will not\r\ninfrequently produce fever and inflammatory changes in the joints,\r\nroughly resembling rheumatism. But the difficulty so far has been,\r\nfirst, that these organisms are of several different kinds and distinct\r\nspecies; and second, and even more important, that almost any of the\r\norganisms of the common infectious diseases are capable at times of\r\nproducing inflammation of the joints and tendons. For instance, the\r\nthird commonest point of attack of the tubercle bacillus, after the\r\nlungs and the glands, is the bones and joints, as illustrated in the\r\nsadly familiar \"white-swelling of the knee\" and hip-joint disease. All\r\nthe so-called septic organisms, which produce suppuration and\r\nblood-poisoning in wounds and surgery, may, and very frequently do,\r\nattack the joints; while nearly all the common infections, such as\r\ntyphoid, scarlet fever, pneumonia, and even measles, influenza, and\r\ntonsillitis, may be followed by severe joint symptoms.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we are coming to recognize that diseases of the joints, like\r\ndiseases of the nervous system, are among the frequent results of any\r\nand all of the acute infectious diseases or fevers; and we now trace\r\nfrom fifty to seventy-five per cent of both joint troubles and\r\ndegenerations of the nervous system to this cause. Two-thirds, for\r\ninstance, of our cases of hip-joint disease and of spinal disease\r\n(_caries_) are due to tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe puzzling problem now before pathologists is the sorting out of these\r\ninnumerable forms of joint inflammations and the splitting off of those\r\nwhich are clearly due to certain specific diseases, from the great,\r\ncentral group of true rheumatism. Most of these joint inflammations\r\nwhich are due to recognized germs, such as the pus-organisms of surgical\r\nfevers, tuberculosis, and typhoid, differ from true rheumatism in that\r\nthey go on to suppuration (formation of \"matter\") and permanently\r\ncripple the joint to a greater or less degree. So that there is probably\r\na germ or group of germs which produces the swift attack and rapid\r\nsubsidence and other characteristic features of true rheumatism, even\r\nthough we have not yet succeeded in sorting them out of the swarm. So\r\nconfident do we feel of this, that although, as will be shown, there are\r\nprobably other factors involved, such as exposure, housing, occupation,\r\nfood, and heredity, yet the best thought of the profession is\r\npractically agreed that none of these would alone produce the disease,\r\nbut that they are only accessory causes plus the micrococcus. In\r\npractically all our modern textbooks of medicine, rheumatism is\r\nincluded under the head of infections.\r\n\r\nThis theory of causation, confessedly provisional and imperfect as it\r\nis, helps us to harmonize the other known facts about the disease; it\r\nhas already greatly improved our treatment and given us a foothold for\r\nattacking the problem of prevention. For instance, it has long been\r\nknown that rheumatism was very apt to follow tonsillitis or other forms\r\nof sore throat; indeed, many of the earlier authorities put down\r\ntonsillitis as one of the great group of \"rheumatic\" disturbances, and\r\npersons of rheumatic family tendency were supposed to have tonsillitis\r\nin childhood and rheumatism in later life. Not more than ten or fifteen\r\nper cent of all cases gave a history of tonsillitis; but since we have\r\nbroadened our conception of infection and begun to inquire, not merely\r\nfor symptoms of tonsillitis, but also for those of influenza, \"common\r\ncolds,\" measles, whooping-cough, and the like, we reach the most\r\nsignificant result of finding that forty to sixty per cent of our cases\r\nof rheumatism have been preceded, anywhere from one to three weeks\r\nbefore, by an attack of some sort of \"cold,\" sore throat, catarrhal\r\nfever, cough, bronchitis, or other group of disturbances due to a mild\r\ninfection. Further, it has long been notorious that when a rheumatic\r\nindividual \"catches cold\" it is exceedingly apt to \"settle in the\r\njoints,\" and, if these cases happen to come under the eye of a\r\nphysician, they are recognized as secondary attacks of true rheumatism.\r\nIn other words, the \"cold\" may simply be a second dose of the same germ\r\nwhich caused the primary attack of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the widespread article of popular belief that\r\nrheumatism is most commonly due to cold, exposure, chill, or damp. Much\r\nof this is found on investigation to be due to the well-known historic\r\nconfusion between \"cold,\" in the sense of exposure to cold air, and\r\n\"cold,\" in the sense of a catarrh or influenza, with running at the\r\nnose, coughing, sore throat, and fever, a group of symptoms now clearly\r\nrecognized to be due to an infection. In short, the vast majority of\r\ncommon colds are unmistakably infections, and spread from one victim to\r\nanother, and this is the type of \"cold\" which causes the majority of\r\nrheumatic attacks.\r\n\r\nThe chill, which any one who is \"coming down\" with a cold experiences,\r\nand usually refers to a draft or a cold room, is, in nine cases out of\r\nten, the rigor which precedes the fever, and has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the external temperature. The large majority of our cases of\r\nrheumatism can give no clear or convincing history of exposure to wet,\r\ncold, or damp. But popular impression is seldom entirely mistaken, and\r\nthere can be no question that, given the presence of the infectious\r\ngerm, a prolonged exposure to cold, and particularly to wet, will often\r\nprove to be the last straw which will break down the patient's power of\r\nresistance, and determine an attack of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThis climatic influence, however, is probably not responsible for more\r\nthan fifteen or twenty per cent of all cases, and, popular impression to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding, the liability of outdoor workers who are\r\nsubject to severe exposure, such as lumbermen, fishermen, and sailors,\r\nis only slightly greater than that of indoor workers. The highest\r\nsusceptibility, in fact, not merely to the disease, but also to the\r\ndevelopment of serious heart involvements, is found among domestic\r\nservants, particularly servant girls, agricultural laborers and their\r\nfamilies (in districts where wages are low and cottages bad), and\r\nslum-dwellers; in fact, those classes which are underfed, overworked,\r\nbadly housed, and crowded together. Diet has exceeding little to do with\r\nthe disease, and, so far from meat or high living of any sort\r\npredisposing to it, it is most common and most serious in precisely\r\nthose classes which get least meat or luxuries of any sort, and are from\r\nstern necessity compelled to live upon a diet of cereals, potatoes,\r\ncheap fats, and coarse vegetables.\r\n\r\nEven its relations to the weather and seasons support the infection\r\ntheory. Its seasonal occurrence is very similar to that of\r\npneumonia,--rarest in summer, commonest in winter, the highest\r\npercentage of cases occurring in the late fall and in the early spring;\r\nin other words, just at those times when people are first beginning to\r\nshut themselves up for the winter, light fires, and close windows, and\r\nat the end of their long period of winter imprisonment, when both their\r\nresisting power has been reduced to the lowest ebb in the year and\r\ninfections of all sorts have had their most favorable conditions of\r\ngrowth for months.\r\n\r\nThe epidemics of rheumatism, which occasionally occur, probably follow\r\nepidemics of influenza, tonsillitis, or other mild infections, and\r\ninstances of two or more cases of rheumatism in one family or household\r\nare most rationally explained as due to the spread of the precedent\r\ninfection from one member of the family to the other. Instances of the\r\ndirect transmission of the disease from one patient to another are\r\nexceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nOur view of the infectious causation of rheumatism, vague as it is, has\r\ngiven us already our first intelligent prospect of prevention. Whatever\r\nmay be the character of a germ or germs, the vast majority of them agree\r\nin making the nose and throat their first point of attack and of entry\r\ninto the system. Hence, vigorous antiseptic and other rational treatment\r\nof all acute disturbances of the nose and throat, however slight, will\r\nprove a valuable preventive and diminisher of the percentage of\r\nrheumatism. This simply emphasizes again the truth and importance of the\r\ndictum of modern medicine, \"Never neglect a cold,\" since we are already\r\nable to trace, not merely rheumatism, but from two-thirds to\r\nthree-fourths of our cases of heart disease, of kidney trouble, and of\r\ninflammations of the nervous system, to those mild infections which we\r\nterm \"colds,\" or to other definite infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nNot only is this good _a priori_ reasoning, but it has been demonstrated\r\nin practice. One of our largest United States army posts had acquired an\r\nunenviable reputation from the amount of rheumatism occurring in the\r\ntroops stationed there. A new surgeon coming to take charge of the post\r\nset about investigating the cause of this state of affairs, and came to\r\nthe conclusion that the disease began as, or closely followed,\r\ntonsillitis and other forms of sore throat. He accordingly saw to it\r\nthat every case of tonsillitis, of cold in the head, or sore throat was\r\nvigorously treated with local germicides and with intestinal\r\nantiseptics and laxatives, until it was completely cured; with the\r\nresult that in less than a year he succeeded in lowering the percentage\r\nof cases of rheumatism per company nearly sixty per cent.\r\n\r\nAt some of our large health-resorts, where great numbers of cases of\r\nrheumatism are treated, it has been discovered that if a case of common\r\ncold, or tonsillitis, happens to come into the establishment, and runs\r\nthrough the inmates, nearly half of the rheumatic patients attacked will\r\nhave a relapse or new seizure of their rheumatism. Accordingly, a\r\nrigorous and hawk-like watch is kept for every possible case of cold,\r\ntonsillitis, or sore throat entering the house; the patient is promptly\r\nisolated and treated on rigidly antiseptic principles, with the result\r\nthat epidemics of relapses of rheumatism in the inmates have greatly\r\ndiminished in frequency.\r\n\r\nIf every case of cold or sore throat were promptly and thoroughly\r\ntreated with antiseptic sprays and washes such as any competent\r\nphysician can direct his patients to keep in the house, in readiness for\r\nsuch an emergency, combined with laxatives and intestinal antiseptic\r\ntreatment, and, above all, with rest in bed as long as any rise of\r\ntemperature is present, there would be a marked diminution in both the\r\nfrequency and the severity of rheumatism. If to this were added an\r\nabundant and nutritious dietary, good ventilation and pure air, an\r\navoidance of overwork and overstrain, we should soon begin to get the\r\nbetter of this distressing disease. In fact, while positive data are\r\nlacking, on account of the small fatality of rheumatism and its\r\nconsequent infrequent appearance among the causes of death in our vital\r\nstatistics, yet it is the almost unanimous opinion of physicians of\r\nexperience that the disease is distinctly diminishing, as a result of\r\nthe marked improvement in food, housing, wages, and living conditions\r\ngenerally, which modern civilization has already brought about.\r\n\r\nSo much for acute rheumatism. Vague and unsatisfactory as is our\r\nknowledge of it, it is, unfortunately, clearness and precision itself\r\nwhen contrasted with the welter of confusion and fog which covers our\r\nideas about the _chronic_ variety. The catholicity of the term is\r\nsomething incredible. Every chronic pain and twinge, from corns to\r\nlocomotor ataxia, and from stone-in-the-kidney to tic-douloureux, has\r\nbeen put down as \"rheumatism.\" It is little better than a diagnostic\r\ngarbage-dump or dust-heap, where can be shot down all kinds of vague and\r\nwandering pains in joints, bones, muscles, and nerves, which have no\r\nvisible or readily ascertainable cause. Probably at least half of all\r\nthe discomforts which are put down as \"rheumatism\" of the ankle, the\r\nelbow, the shoulder, are not rheumatism at all, in any true or\r\nreasonable sense of the term, but merely painful symptoms due to other\r\nperfectly definite disease conditions of every imaginable sort. The\r\nremaining half may be divided into two great groups of nearly equal\r\nsize. One of these, like acute rheumatism, is closely related to, and\r\nprobably caused by, the attack of acute infections of milder character,\r\nfalling upon less favorable soil. The other is of a vaguer type and is\r\ndue, probably, to the accumulation of poisonous waste-products in the\r\ntissues, setting up irritative and even inflammatory changes in nerve,\r\nmuscle, and joint. Either of these may be made worse by exposure to cold\r\nor changes in the weather. In fact, this is the type of rheumatism which\r\nhas such a wide reputation as a barometer and weather prophet, second\r\nonly to that of the United States Signal Service. When you \"feel it in\r\nyour bones,\" you know it is going to snow, or to rain, or to clear up,\r\nor become cloudy, or whatever else may happen to follow the sensation,\r\nmerely because all poisoned and irritated nerves are more sensitive to\r\nchanges in temperature, wind-direction, moisture, and electric tension,\r\nthan sound and normal ones. The change in the weather does not cause the\r\nrheumatism. It is the rheumatism that enables us to predict the change\r\nin the weather, though we have no clear idea what that change will be.\r\n\r\nProbably the only statement of wide application that can be made in\r\nregard to the nature of chronic rheumatism is that a very considerable\r\npercentage of it is due to the accumulation of poisons (toxins) in the\r\nnerves supplying joints and muscles, setting up an irritation\r\n(neurotoxis), or, in extreme cases, an inflammation of the nerve\r\n(neuritis), which may even go on to partial paralysis, with wasting of\r\nthe muscles supplied. The same broad principles of causation and\r\nprevention, therefore, apply here as in acute rheumatism.\r\n\r\nThe most important single fact for rheumatics of all sorts, whether\r\nacute or chronic, to remember is that they must _avoid exposure to\r\ncolds_, in the sense of infections of all sorts, as they would a\r\npestilence; that they must eat plenty of rich, sound, nourishing food;\r\nlive in well-ventilated rooms; take plenty of exercise in the open air,\r\nto burn up any waste poisons that may be accumulating in the tissues;\r\ndress lightly but warmly (there is no special virtue in flannels), and\r\ntreat every cold or mild infection which they may be unfortunate enough\r\nto catch, according to the strictest rigor of the antiseptic law.\r\n\r\nThe influence of diet in chronic rheumatism is almost as slight as in\r\nthe acute form. Persons past middle age who can afford to indulge their\r\nappetites and are inclined to eat and drink more than is good for them,\r\nand, what is far more important, to exercise much less, may so embarrass\r\ntheir liver and kidneys as to create accumulations of waste products in\r\nthe blood sufficient to cause rheumatic twinges. The vast majority,\r\nhowever, of the sufferers from chronic rheumatism, like those from the\r\nacute form, are underfed rather than overfed, and a liberal and abundant\r\ndietary, including plenty of red meats, eggs, fresh butter, green\r\nvegetables, and fresh fruits, will improve their nutrition and diminish\r\ntheir tendency to the attacks.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be absolutely no rational foundation for the popular\r\nbelief that red meats cause rheumatism, either from the point of view of\r\npractical experience, or from that of chemical composition. We now know\r\nthat white meats of all sorts are quite as rich in those elements known\r\nas the purin bodies, or uric-acid group, as red meats, and many of them\r\nmuch richer. It may be said in passing, that this last-mentioned bugbear\r\nof our diet-reformers is now believed to have nothing whatever to do\r\nwith rheumatism, and probably very little with gout, and that the\r\nravings of Haig and the Uric-Acid School generally are now thoroughly\r\ndiscredited. Certainly, whenever you see any remedy or any method of\r\ntreatment vaunted as a cure for rheumatism, by neutralizing or washing\r\nout uric acid, you may safely set it down as a fraud.\r\n\r\nOne rather curious and unexpected fact should, however, be mentioned in\r\nregard to the relation of diet to rheumatism, and that is that many\r\nrheumatic patients have a peculiar susceptibility to some one article of\r\nfood. This may be a perfectly harmless and wholesome thing for the vast\r\nmajority of the species, but to this individual it acts as a poison and\r\nwill promptly produce pains in the joints, redness, and even swelling,\r\nsometimes accompanied by a rash and severe disturbances of the digestive\r\ntract. The commonest offenders form a curious group in their apparent\r\nharmlessness, headed as they are by strawberries, followed by\r\nraspberries, cherries, bananas, oranges; then clams, crabs, and oysters;\r\nthen cheese, especially overripe kinds; and finally, but very rarely,\r\ncertain meats, like mutton and beef. What is the cause of this curious\r\nsusceptibility we do not know, but it not infrequently occurs with this\r\ngroup of foods in rheumatics and also in asthmatics.\r\n\r\nBoth rheumatics and asthmatics are also subject to attacks of urticaria\r\nor \"hives\" (nettle-rash), from these and other special articles of diet.\r\n\r\nAs to principles of treatment in a disease of so varied and indefinite a\r\ncharacter, due to such a multitude of causes, obviously nothing can be\r\nsaid except in the broadest and sketchiest of outline. The prevailing\r\ntendency is, for the acute form, rest in bed, the first and most\r\nimportant, also the second, the third, and the last element in the\r\ntreatment. This will do more to diminish the severity of the attack and\r\nprevent the occurrence of heart and other complications than any other\r\nsingle procedure.\r\n\r\nAfter this has been secured, the usual plan is to assist nature in the\r\nelimination of the toxins by alkalies, alkaline mineral waters, and\r\nother laxatives; to relieve the pain, promote the comfort, and improve\r\nthe rest of the patient by a variety of harmless nerve-deadeners or\r\npain-relievers, chief among which are the salicylates, aspirin, and the\r\nmilder coal-tar products. By a judicious use of these in competent hands\r\nthe pain and distress of the disease can be very greatly relieved, but\r\nit has not been found that its duration is much shortened thereby, or\r\neven that the danger of heart and other complication is greatly\r\nlessened. The agony of the inflamed joints may be much diminished by\r\nswathing in cotton-wool and flannel bandages, or in cloths wrung out of\r\nhot alkalies covered with oiled silk, or by light bandages kept\r\nsaturated with some evaporating lotion containing alcohol. As soon as\r\nthe fever has subsided, then hot baths and gentle massage of the\r\naffected joints give great relief and hasten the cure. But, when all is\r\nsaid and done, the most important curative element, as has already been\r\nintimated, is six weeks in bed.\r\n\r\nIn the chronic form the same remedies to relieve the pain are sometimes\r\nuseful, but very much less effective, and often of little or no value.\r\nDry heat, moist heat, gentle massage, and prolonged baking in special\r\nmetal ovens, will often give much relief. Liniments of all sorts, from\r\nspavin cures to skunk oil, are chiefly of value in proportion to the\r\namount of friction and massage administered when they are rubbed in.\r\n\r\nIn short, there is no disease under heaven in which so much depends upon\r\na careful study of each individual case and adaptation of treatment to\r\nit personally, according to its cause and the patient in whom it occurs.\r\nRheumatism, unfortunately, does tend to \"run in families.\" Apparently\r\nsome peculiar susceptibility of the nervous system to influences which\r\nwould be comparatively harmless to normal nerves and cells is capable of\r\nbeing inherited. But this inheritance is almost invariably \"recessive,\"\r\nin Mendelian terms, and a majority of the children of even the most\r\nrheumatic parent may entirely escape the disease, especially if they\r\nlive rationally and vigorously, feed themselves abundantly, and avoid\r\noverwork and overcrowding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGERM-FOES THAT FOLLOW THE KNIFE, OR DEATH UNDER THE FINGER-NAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nOur principal dread of a wound is from fear that it may fester instead\r\nof healing quickly. We don't exactly enjoy being shot, or stabbed, or\r\nscratched, though, as a matter of fact, in what Mulvaney calls the \"fog\r\nav fightin'\" we hardly notice such trifles unless immediately disabling.\r\nBut our greatest fear after the bleeding has stopped is lest\r\nblood-poisoning may set in. And we do well to dread it, for in the olden\r\ndays,--that is, barely fifty years ago,--in wounds of any size or\r\nseriousness, two-thirds of the risk remained to be run after the\r\nbleeding had been stopped and the bandages put on. Nowadays the danger\r\nis only a fraction of one per cent, but till half a century ago every\r\nwound was expected to form \"matter\" or _pus_ in the process of healing,\r\nas a matter of course. Most of us can recall the favorite and brilliant\r\nrepartee of our boyhood days in answer to the inquisitive query, \"What's\r\nthe matter?\" \"Nuthin': it hasn't come to matter yet. It's only a fresh\r\ncut!\"\r\n\r\nEven surgeons thought it a necessary part of the process of healing, and\r\nthe approving term \"laudable pus\" was applied to a soft, creamy\r\ndischarge, without either offensive odor or tinge of blood, upon the\r\nsurfaces of the healing wound; and the hospital records of that day\r\nnoted with satisfaction that, after an operation, \"suppuration was\r\nestablished.\" So strongly was this idea intrenched, that a free\r\ndischarge or outpouring of some sort was necessary to the proper healing\r\nof the wound, that in the Middle Ages it was regarded as exceedingly\r\ndangerous to permit wounds to close too quickly. Wounds that had\r\npartially united were actually torn apart, and liquids like oil and wine\r\nand strong acids, which tended to keep them from closing and to set up\r\nsuppuration, were actually poured into them; and in some instances their\r\nsides were actually burned with hot irons. There was a solid basis of\r\nreason underlying even these extraordinary methods, viz., the \"rule of\r\nthumb\" observation, handed down from one generation to another, that\r\nwounds that discharged freely and \"sweetly,\" while they were slow in\r\nhealing and left disfiguring scars, usually did not give rise to serious\r\nor fatal attacks of blood-poison or wound-fever. And of two evils they\r\nchose the less. Plenty of pus and a big ugly scar in preference to an\r\nattack of dangerous blood-poisoning. Even if it didn't kill you, it\r\nmight easily cripple you for life by involving a joint. The trouble was\r\nwith their logic, or rather with their premises. They were firmly\r\nconvinced that the danger came from within, that there was a sort of\r\nmorbid humor which must be allowed to escape, or it would be dammed up\r\nin the system with disastrous results.\r\n\r\nOne day a brilliant skeptic by the name of Lister (who is still living)\r\ntook it into his head that perhaps the fathers of surgery and their\r\ngenerations of imitators might have been wrong. He tried the experiment,\r\nshut germs out of his wounds, and behold, antiseptic surgery, with all\r\nits magnificent line of triumphs, was born!\r\n\r\nNow a single drop of pus in an operation wound is as deep a disgrace as\r\na bedbug on the pillow of a model housekeeper, and calls for as vigorous\r\nan overhauling of equipment, from cellar to skylight; while a second\r\ndrop means a commission of inquiry and a drumhead court-martial. This is\r\nthe secret of the advances of modern surgery,--not that our surgeons are\r\nany more skillful with the knife, but that they can enter cavities like\r\nthose of the skull, the spinal cord, the abdomen, and the chest, remove\r\nwhat is necessary, and get out again with almost perfect safety; whereas\r\nthese cavities were absolutely forbidden ground to their forefathers, on\r\naccount of the twenty, forty, yes, seventy per cent death risk from\r\nsuppuration and blood-poison.\r\n\r\nThe triumphs of antisepsis and asepsis, or keeping the \"bugs\" out of the\r\ncuts, have been illustrated scores of times already by abler pens, and\r\nare a household word, but certain of its practical appliances in the\r\nwounds and scratches and trifling injuries of every-day life are not yet\r\nso thoroughly familiar as they should be. When once we know who our\r\nwound-enemies are, whence they came, and how they are carried, the fate\r\nof the battle is practically in our own hands.\r\n\r\nLike most disease-germs our wound-infection foes are literally \"they of\r\nour own household.\" They don't pounce down upon us from the trees, or\r\nlie in wait for us in the thickets, or creep in the grass, or grow in\r\nthe soil, or swarm in our food. They live and can live only within the\r\nshelter of our own bodies, where it is warm and moist and comfortable.\r\nThis is one great (in the expressive vernacular) \"cinch\" that we have on\r\nthe vast majority of disease-germs, whether medical or surgical, that\r\nthey do not flourish and breed outside of the body, or of houses closed\r\nand warm; and this grip can be improved, with skill and determination,\r\ninto a veritable strangle-hold on most of them. In the language of\r\nbiology, most of them have become \"adapted to their environment\" so\r\nclosely that they can scarcely flourish and breed anywhere outside of\r\nthe warm, moist, fertile soil of a living body, and many of them cannot\r\neven live long at temperatures more than ten degrees above or fifteen\r\ndegrees below that of the body. At all events, so poorly are these\r\npus-germs able to preserve their vigor and power of attack, not merely\r\noutside of the human body, but outside of some wound or sore spot, that\r\nit is practically certain that eight-tenths of all cases of\r\nwound-infection or blood-poisoning come directly from some previous\r\nfestering wound, sore, ulcer, scab, boil, or pimple, in or on some other\r\nhuman being or animal. Practically whenever we get pus in a wound in a\r\nhospital, we insist upon finding the precise previous case of pus from\r\nwhich that originated, and seldom is our search unsuccessful. If we kept\r\nnot only our wounds surgically clean, but our gums, noses, throats,\r\nskins, and fingernails, and burned and sterilized everything that came\r\nin contact with a sore, pustule, or scab, we should wipe out nine-tenths\r\nof our cases of wound-infection and suppuration; in fact, practically\r\nall of them, except such small percentage as may come from contact with\r\ninfections in animals. This is the reason why, up to half a century ago,\r\nby a strange paradox hospitals were among the most dangerous places to\r\nperform operations in, on account of the abundance of wounds or sores\r\nalways present for the pus-germs to breed in, and the fact that out of\r\nfifty or more wound-cases, there was practically certain to be one or\r\ntwo infected ones to poison the whole lot.\r\n\r\nSurgeons, ignorant of antisepsis, and careless nurses, spread the\r\ninfection along, until in some instances it reached a virulence which\r\nburst into the dreaded \"hospital gangrene.\" This dread disease was the\r\nscourge of all hospitals, especially military ones, all over the\r\ncivilized world, as recently as our War of Secession. In some wards of\r\nour military hospitals, from thirty to fifty per cent of all the wounded\r\nreceived were attacked, and over five thousand cases were formally\r\nreported during the war, of which nearly fifty per cent died. This\r\nplague was born solely of those two great mothers of evils, ignorance\r\nand dirt, and is to-day, in civilized lands, as extinct as the dodo.\r\nThen the dread that the community had of hospitals, as places that \"help\r\nthe poor to die,\" in Browning's phrase, had a certain amount of\r\nfoundation; and cases operated upon in a farmhouse kitchen, where no one\r\nin the family happened to have had a boil or a catarrh or a festering\r\ncut within a month or so, and where the knife happened to be clean or\r\nnew, would recover with less suppuration than hospital cases. Nowadays,\r\nfrom incessant and eternal vigilance, a hospital is surgically the\r\ncleanest and safest place in the world for an operation, so that most\r\nsurgeons decline to operate outside of one, except in emergencies; and\r\nsome will not even operate except in one with which they are personally\r\nconnected, so that they know every step in the process of protection.\r\n\r\nIt was this terrible risk of the surgeon carrying infection from one\r\ncase to another, that made the coroner of London declare, barely sixty\r\nyears ago, that he would hold an inquest upon the next case of death\r\nafter ovariotomy that was reported to him, on account of the fearful\r\npus-mortality that followed this serious operation, which now has a\r\npossible death-rate from all causes connected with the operation of only\r\na fraction of one per cent.\r\n\r\nThe brusque reply is still remembered of Lawson Tait, the great English\r\novariotomist, to a distinguished German colleague, who had inquired the\r\nsecret of his then marvelously low death-rate: after a glance at the\r\nbands of mourning on the ends of the other's fingers, he said, \"I keep\r\nmy fingernails clean, sir!\" There was sadly too much truth in the saying\r\nof another eminent surgeon, that in the pre-Listerian days many a poor\r\nwoman's death warrant was written under the fingernails of her surgeon.\r\nThis reproach has been wiped out, thank Heaven! but the labor, pains,\r\nand persistence after heart-breaking failures which it took to do it!\r\nNever was there a more vivid illustration of the declaration that genius\r\nis the capacity for taking pains, than antiseptic surgery! Not a\r\nloophole must be left unstopped, not a possibility unconsidered, not a\r\nthing in, or about, or connected with, the operating-room left\r\nunsterilized, except the patient and the surgeon; and these are brought\r\nas near to it as is possible without danger to life.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the operating-room itself must be like a bath room,\r\nor, more accurately, the inside of a cistern. Walls, floor, and ceiling\r\nare all waterproof and capable of being washed down with a hose. There\r\nmust be no casings or cornices of any sort to catch dust; and in the\r\nbest appointed hospitals no one is permitted to enter, under any\r\npretext, whose hands and garments have not been sterilized.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, everything that is brought into the room for use\r\nin, or during, the operation, is first thoroughly sterilized. The\r\nknives, instruments, and other operative objects are sterilized by\r\nboiling, or by the use of superheated steam; and the towels, dressings,\r\nbandages, sheets, etc., by boiling, baking, or superheated steam. Then\r\nbegins the preparation of the surgeon and the nurse. Dressing-rooms are\r\nprovided, in which the outer garments are removed, and the hands given\r\nan ordinary wash. Then the scrubbing-room is entered, where, at a series\r\nof basins provided with running hot and cold water, whose faucets are\r\nturned by pressure with the foot so as to avoid any necessity for\r\ntouching them with the hand, the hands are thoroughly scrubbed with hot\r\nwater, boiled soap, and a boiled nail-brush. Then they are plunged into,\r\nand thoroughly soaked in, some strong antiseptic solution, then washed\r\nagain; then plunged into another antiseptic solution, containing some\r\nfat solvent like ether or alcohol, to wash off any dirt that may have\r\nbeen protected by the natural oil of the skin. Then they are thoroughly\r\nscrubbed with soap and hot water again, to remove all traces of the\r\nantiseptics, most of which are irritating to wounded tissues; then\r\nwashed in absolute alcohol, then in boiled or distilled water. Then the\r\nnurse, whose hands are already sterilized, takes out of the original\r\npackage in which it came from the sterilizing oven, a linen surgical\r\ngown or suit which covers the operator from neck to toes. A sterilized\r\nlinen or cotton cap is placed upon his head and pulled down so that the\r\nscales or germs of any sort may not fall into the wound. Some surgeons\r\nof stout and comfortable habit, who are apt to perspire in the high\r\ntemperature of an operating-room, will tie a band of gauze around their\r\nforeheads, to prevent any unexpected drops of perspiration from falling\r\ninto the wound; while some purists muffle up the mouth and lower part of\r\nthe face lightly in a similar comforter.\r\n\r\nYou would think that by this time the hands were clean enough to go\r\nanywhere with safety, but no risks are going to be taken. A pair of\r\nrubber or cotton gloves, the former taken right out of a strong\r\nantiseptic solution, the latter out of the sterilizing oven, are pulled\r\ncarefully on by the nurse. Holding his sacred hands spread out rigidly\r\nbefore him, like the front paws of a kangaroo, the surgeon carefully\r\nedges his way into the operating-room, waiting for any doors that he may\r\nhave to pass through to be opened by the nurse, or awkwardly pushing\r\nthem with his elbow. In that attitude of benediction, the hands are\r\nmaintained until the operation is ready to begin.\r\n\r\nThen comes the patient! If his condition will in any wise permit, he has\r\nbeen given a boiling hot bath and scrub the night before, and put to bed\r\nin a sterilized nightgown between sterilized sheets. The region which is\r\nto be operated upon has, at the same time, been scrubbed and rubbed and\r\nflushed with hot water, germicides, alcohol, soap,--in fact, has gone\r\nthrough the same sacred ceremonial of cleansing through which the\r\nsurgeons' hands have passed; and a large, closely fitting antiseptic\r\ndressing, covering the whole field, has been applied and tightly bound.\r\nHe is brought into a waiting-room and put under ether by an anæsthetist,\r\nthrough a sterilized mask; he is then wheeled into the operating-room,\r\nthe dressing is removed, a thorough double scrub is again given, for\r\n\"good measure,\" to the whole area in which the wound is to be made. A\r\nbig sheet is thrown over the lower part of his body, another over the\r\nupper part, a third, with an oval opening in the centre of it, thrown\r\nover the region to be operated upon. The instrument nurse takes a boiled\r\nknife out of a sterilized dish of distilled water, hands it to the\r\nsurgeon, who takes it in his gloved hand, and the operation begins.\r\n\r\nNow, if you can think of any possible chink through which a wandering\r\nstreptococcus can, by any possibility, sneak into that wound, please\r\nsuggest it, and it shall be closed immediately!\r\n\r\nThe intruders against whom all these preparations are made are two in\r\nnumber: _Streptococcus pyogenes_ and _Staphylococcus pyogenes_--cousins,\r\nas you see, by their names. Their last (not family) name really means\r\nsomething, and is not half so alarming as it sounds, as it is Greek for\r\n\"pus-making.\" Their real family name, _Coccus_, which means a berry, was\r\nsuggested, by their rounded shape under the microscope, to some\r\npoetically minded microscopist. Undesirable citizens, both of them! But\r\nthe older, or _Strepto_, cousin is by far the more dangerous character\r\nand desperate individual, giving rise to and being concerned in nearly\r\nall the civilized and dangerous wound-fevers--septicæmia, erysipelas,\r\netc. _Staphylococcus_ is a milder and less harmful individual, seldom\r\ngoing farther than to produce the milder forms of festering,\r\ndischarging, refusing to heal, pustules, etc. He is not to be given a\r\nyard of leeway, however, for if he can get a sufficient number of dirty\r\nwounds to run through, he can work himself up to a high degree of\r\nvirulence and poisoning power. Indeed, this faculty of his may possibly\r\nfurnish a clew as to how these pus-makers developed their power of\r\nliving in wounds, and almost nowhere else. There is another cousin also,\r\nin the group, called _Staphylococcus pyogenes albus_, to distinguish him\r\n(_albus_, \"white\") from the other two, who have the tag name aureus\r\n(golden). He is an almost harmless denizen of the surfaces of our\r\nbodies, particularly the mouths of the sweat-ducts, and the openings of\r\nthe hair follicles. Under peculiarly favorable circumstances, such as a\r\nvery big wound, an aggravated chafe, or the application of that\r\nchampion \"bug-breeder,\" a poultice, he may summon up courage enough\r\nto attack some half-dead skin-cells and make a few drops of pus on\r\nhis own account. He is the criminal concerned in the so-called\r\nstitch-abscesses, or tiny points of pus which form around the stitches\r\nof a big wound and in some of the smaller pimples which turn to\r\n\"matter.\" It is conceivable that this feeble and harmless white coccus\r\nmay at some time have been accelerated under favorable circumstances to\r\nwhere he was endowed with \"yellow\" powers, and even, upon another turn\r\nof the screw, with strepto-virulence. But this is a mere academic\r\nquestion. Practically the only thing needful is to keep all the rascals\r\nout of every wound.\r\n\r\nNow comes the question, how is this to be done? Fortunately it is not\r\nnecessary to hunt out and destroy the pus-germs in their breeding-places\r\noutside of the human body. As we have seen, they do not long retain\r\ntheir vitality out of doors, or as a rule even in the dust of rooms and\r\ndirt of houses, unless the latter have been recently contaminated with\r\nthe dressings of, or discharges from, wounds. There are two main things\r\nto be watched: first, the wound itself, and second, any unwashed or\r\nunsterilized part of your own or some other living body. Dirt of all\r\nsorts is a mighty good thing to keep absolutely out of the wound, but\r\npractically a whole handful of ordinary soil or dust rubbed into a wound\r\nmight not, unless it happened to contain fertilizer of some sort, be\r\nhalf so dangerous as a single touch with a finger which had been\r\ndressing a wound, picking a scab out of the nose, rubbing an ulcerated\r\ngum, or scratching an itching scalp. If it be a cut on the finger, or\r\nscratch on the hand, for instance, don't suck it, or lick it, unless you\r\ncan give an absolutely clean bill of health to your gums and teeth. If\r\nnot thoroughly brushed three or four times a day, they are sure to be\r\nswarming with germs of twenty or thirty different species, which not\r\ninfrequently include one or both of the pus-germs. Indeed, the real\r\nreason why the bite of certain animals, and above all of a man,\r\nparticularly of a \"blue-gum nigger,\" is regarded as so dangerous is on\r\naccount of the swarms of germs that breed in any remnants of food left\r\nbetween the teeth or in the pockets of ulcerating gums. Many a human\r\nbite is almost as dangerous as a rattlesnake's. The devoted hero who\r\nsucks the poison of the dagger out of the wound may be conferring a\r\ndoubtful benefit, if he happens to be suffering from Rigg's disease.\r\n\r\nDon't try to stop the bleeding unless it comes in spurts or the flow is\r\nserious. The loss of a few teaspoonfuls, tablespoonfuls, or, for the\r\nmatter of that, cupfuls, of blood won't do you any harm, and its free\r\nflow will wash out the cut from the bottom, and carry out most of the\r\ngerms that may happen to be present on the knife or nail. If water and\r\ndressings are not accessible, let the blood cake and dry over the wound\r\nwithout disturbing it, even though it does look rather gory.\r\n\r\nA slight cut with a clean knife, or other instrument, into which no dirt\r\nhas been rubbed, will often require no other dressing than its own\r\nblood-scab. If, however, as oftener happens, you cannot be sure of the\r\ncleanness of the knife, tool, or nail, hold the wound under running\r\nwater from a pump or tap (this is not germ-free, but practically never\r\ncontains pus-germs), until the wound has been thoroughly washed out,\r\nwiping any gravel or dirt out of the cut with soft rags which have been\r\nrecently washed, or baked in the oven; then dry with a small piece of\r\nlinen, or white goods, put on a dressing of absorbent cotton such as can\r\nbe purchased for a few cents an ounce at any drug store. Absorbent or\r\nsurgical cotton makes a good dressing, because it both sucks up any\r\nfluids which might leak out of the wound, and forms a mesh-filter\r\nthrough which no germs can penetrate.\r\n\r\nIt is not advisable to use sticking-plaster for any but the most trivial\r\nwounds, and seldom even for these, for several reasons. First, because\r\nits application usually involves licking it to make it stick; second,\r\nbecause it must cover a sufficient amount of skin on either side of the\r\nwound to give it firm grip, and this area of skin contains a\r\nconsiderable number of both sweat-ducts and hair-follicles, which will\r\nkeep on discharging under the plaster, producing a moist and unhealthy\r\ncondition of the lips of the wound. Moreover, these sweat-ducts and\r\nhair-follicles will, as we have seen, frequently contain white\r\nstaphylococci, which are at times capable of setting up a low grade of\r\ninflammation in the wound. A wound always heals better if its surfaces\r\nand coverings can be kept dry. This is why cotton makes such an ideal\r\ndressing, since it permits the free evaporation of moisture, a moderate\r\naccess of air, and yet keeps out all germs.\r\n\r\nIf the cut or scratch is of any depth or seriousness whatever, or the\r\nknife, tool, or other instrument be dirty, or if any considerable amount\r\nof street-dust or garden-soil has got into the wound, then it is, by\r\nall means, advisable to go to a physician, have the wound thoroughly\r\ncleaned on antiseptic principles, and put up in antiseptic dressing. A\r\nsingle treatment of this sort, in a comparatively trifling wound which\r\nhas become in any way contaminated, may save weeks of suffering and\r\ndisability, and often danger of life, and will in eight cases out of ten\r\nshorten the time of healing from forty to sixty per cent. The rapidity\r\nwith which a wound in a reasonably healthy individual, cleaned and\r\ndressed on modern surgical principles, will heal, is almost incredible,\r\nuntil it has actually been seen.\r\n\r\nThe principal danger of garden-soil or street-dust in a wound is not so\r\nmuch from pus-germs, though these may be present, as from another\r\n\"bug\"--the tetanus or lockjaw bacillus. This deadly organism lives in\r\nthe alimentary canal of the horse, and hence is to be found in any dirt\r\nor soil which contains horse manure. It is, fortunately, not very\r\ncommon, or widely spread, but enough so to make it the part of prudence\r\nto have thoroughly asepticized and dressed any wound into which\r\nconsiderable amounts of garden-soil, or street-dust, have been rubbed.\r\nThe reason why wounds of the feet and hands have had such a bad\r\nreputation, both for festering and giving rise to lockjaw, is that it is\r\nprecisely in these situations that they are most likely to get\r\ngarden-soil, or stable manure, into them. The classic rusty nail does\r\nnot deserve the bad reputation as a wound-maker which it enjoys, its bad\r\nodor being chiefly due to the fact already referred to, that injuries\r\ninflicted by it are most apt to be in the palm of the hand, or in the\r\nsole of the foot, and hence peculiarly liable to contamination by the\r\ntetanus and other soil bacilli.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other which we don't as yet thoroughly understand,\r\nburns from a toy pistol in particular, and Fourth of July fireworks in\r\ngeneral, seem to be peculiarly liable to be followed by tetanus. The\r\nfulminate used in the cap of a toy pistol, and the paper and explosives\r\nof several of the brands of firecrackers, have been thoroughly examined\r\nbacteriologically, but without finding any tetanus germs in them. So\r\nmany cases of lockjaw used to follow the Fourth of July celebrations a\r\nfew years ago, that Boards of Health became alarmed, and not only\r\nforbade outright the sale of deadly toy pistols, but provided supplies\r\nof the tetanus antitoxin at various depots throughout the cities, so\r\nthat all patriotic wounds of this description could have it dropped into\r\nthem when they were dressed. Since then, the lockjaw penalty which we\r\npay for our highly intelligent method of celebrating the Fourth, has\r\ndiminished considerably. It is probable that the mortality was chiefly\r\ndue to infection of the ugly, slow-healing, dirty little wounds with\r\ncity-dust, a large percentage of which, of course, is dried horse\r\nmanure. What with the tetanus bacillus and the swarms of flies which\r\nbreed chiefly in stable manure, and carry summer diseases, typhoid,\r\ndiphtheria, and tuberculosis in every direction, it will not be long\r\nbefore the keeping of horses within city limits will be as strictly\r\nforbidden as pigpens now are.\r\n\r\nSo definite is the connection between the tetanus bacilli and the soil,\r\nthat tetanus fields or lockjaw gardens are now recognized and listed by\r\nthe health authorities, on account of their having given rise to several\r\nsuccessive cases of the disease. Workers in such fields or gardens, who\r\nscratch or cut themselves, are warned to report themselves promptly for\r\ntreatment with the tetanus antitoxin.\r\n\r\nApart from the tetanus germ, however, the problem of the treatment of\r\nwounds--while there should be perfect cleanliness, the spotlessness of\r\nthe model housekeeper multiplied fivefold--is yet not so much a matter\r\nof keeping dirt in general out of the wound, as of keeping out that\r\n_particular form of dirt which consists of or contains, discharges from\r\nsome previous wound, sore, ulcer, or boil!_\r\n\r\nWhile both these pus-organisms can breed and flourish freely only in\r\nwounds or sores, this is but their starting-point where they gather\r\nstrength to invade the entire organism. We used to make a distinction\r\nbetween those cases in which their toxins or poison-products got into\r\nthe blood, with the production of fever, headache, backache, delirium,\r\nsweats, etc., which we term _septicæmia_, and other cases in which the\r\ncocci themselves were carried into the blood and swept all over the body\r\nby forming fresh foci, or breeding-places, which resulted in abscesses\r\nall over the body, which we call _pyæmia_. But now we know that there is\r\nno hard and fast line to be drawn, and that the germs get into the blood\r\nmuch more easily than we supposed; and the degree and dangerousness of\r\nthe fever which they set up depend, first, upon their virulence, or\r\npoisonousness, and, second, upon the resisting power of the patient at\r\nthe time. Anything which lowers the general health and strength and\r\nweakens the resisting power of the body will make it much easier for\r\npus-germs to get an entrance into it, and overwhelm it; so that, after\r\nprolonged famines for instance, or among the population of besieged\r\ncities, or in armies or exploring expeditions which have been deprived\r\nof food and exposed to great hardship, the merest scratch will fester\r\nand inflame, and give rise to a serious and even fatal attack of\r\nblood-poisoning, erysipelas, hospital gangrene, etc. Famines and sieges\r\nin fact are not infrequently followed by positive epidemics of\r\nblood-poisoning, often in exceedingly severe and fatal forms.\r\n\r\nIt was long ago noted by the chroniclers that the death-rate from\r\nwound-fever among the soldiers of a defeated army was apt to be much\r\ngreater than among those of the victorious one, and this was quoted as\r\none of the stock evidences of the influence of mind over body. But we\r\nnow know that armies are not beaten without some physical cause, that\r\nthe defeated soldiers are apt to be in poorer physical condition to\r\nbegin with; that they have often been cut off from their base of\r\nsupplies, have made desperate forced marches without food or shelter in\r\nthe course of their retreat; and, until within comparatively recent\r\nyears, were never half so well treated or well fed as their captors.\r\n\r\nAs the invading germs pass into the body, they travel most commonly\r\nthrough the lymph-channels and skin; are arrested and threatened with\r\ndestruction by the so-called lymphatic glands, or lymph-nodes. This is\r\nwhy, if you have a festering wound or boil on your hand or wrist, the\r\n\"kernels\" or lymph-nodes up in your armpit will swell and become\r\npainful. If the lymph-nodes can conquer the germs and eat them up, the\r\nswelling goes down and the pain disappears. But if the germs, on the\r\nother hand, succeed in poisoning and killing the cells of the body,\r\nthese latter melt down and turn to pus, and we get what we call a\r\n\"secondary abscess.\"\r\n\r\nThe next commonest point of attack of these pus-germs, if they once get\r\ninto the body, and by far the most dangerous, is the heart, as in\r\nrheumatism and other fevers. Some will also attack the kidneys, giving\r\nrise to albumin in the urine, while others attack the membranes of the\r\njoints (_synovia_) and cause suppuration of one or more joints in the\r\nbody, which is very apt to be followed by very serious stiffening or\r\ncrippling. So that, common, and, in many instances, comparatively mild\r\nas they are, the pus-germs in the aggregate are responsible for a very\r\nlarge amount of damage to the human body.\r\n\r\nThis is the way the _streptococcus_ and _staphylococcus_ behave in an\r\nopen wound, or sore; but they have two other methods of operating which\r\nare somewhat special and peculiar. One of these is where the germ digs\r\nand burrows, as it were, underground, in a limited space, resulting in\r\nthat charming product known as a boil, or a carbuncle. The other, where\r\nit spreads rapidly over the surface just under the skin, after the\r\nfashion of the prairie fire, producing _erysipelas_. In the first of\r\nthese he behaves like the famous burrowing owl of our Western plains,\r\nwho forms, with the prairie-dog, the so-called \"happy family.\" He never\r\nmakes his own burrow, he simply uses one which is already provided for\r\nhim by nature, and that is the little close-fitting pouch surrounding\r\nthe root of a hair. Whether the criminal is a harmless native white\r\ncoccus which has suddenly developed anti-social tendencies, or a\r\nMongolian immigrant who has been accidentally introduced, is still an\r\nopen question. The probabilities are that it is more frequently the\r\nlatter, as, while boils are absolutely no respecters, either of persons\r\nor places, and may rear their horrid heads in every possible region of\r\nthe human form divine, yet they display a very decided tendency to\r\nappear most frequently in regions like the back of the neck, the wrist,\r\nthe hips, and the nose. One thing that these areas have in common is\r\nthat they are liable to a considerable amount of chafing and scratching\r\nas by collars and stocks on the neck, and cuffs on the wrists, or of\r\nfriction from belts, or pressure or chafing from chairs or saddles. When\r\nthe tissues have been bruised or chafed after such fashion, especially\r\nif the surface of the skin has been at the same time broken, and any\r\npus-organism is either present in the hair-follicle, like the white\r\ncoccus, or rubbed into it by a finger or finger-nail which has just been\r\nsucked in the mouth, used to pick the nose, or possibly engaged in\r\ndressing some wound, or cutting meat, or handling fertilizer, then all\r\nthe materials for an explosion are at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCANCER, OR TREASON IN THE BODY-STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe imagination of the race has ever endowed Cancer with a peculiar\r\nindividuality of its own. Although it has vaguely personified in darkest\r\nages other diseases, like the Plague, the Pestilence, and _Maya_ (the\r\nSmallpox), these have rapidly faded away in even the earliest light of\r\ncivilization, and have never approached in concreteness and definiteness\r\nthe malevolent personality of Cancer. Its sudden appearance, the utter\r\nabsence of any discoverable cause, the twinges of agonizing pain that\r\nshoot out from it in all directions, its stone-like hardness in the\r\nsoft, elastic flesh of the body, the ruthless way in which it eats into\r\nand destroys every organ and tissue that come in its way, make this\r\nimpression, not merely of personality, but of positive malevolence,\r\nalmost unescapable.\r\n\r\nIts very name is instinct and bristling with this idea: _Krebs_, in\r\nGerman, _Cancer_, in Latin, French, and English, _Carcinoma_, in Greek,\r\nall alike mean \"Crab,\" a ghastly, flesh-eating parasite, gnawing its way\r\ninto the body. The simile is sufficiently obvious. The hard mass is the\r\nbody of the beast; the pain of the growth is due to his bite; the hard\r\nridges of scar tissue which radiate in all directions into the\r\nsurrounding skin are his claws.\r\n\r\nThe singular thing is that, while brushing aside, of course, all these\r\ngrotesque similes, the most advanced researches of science are\r\ndeveloping more and more clearly the conception of the independent\r\nindividuality--as they term it, the _autonomy_--of cancer.\r\n\r\nMore and more decidedly are they drifting toward the unwelcome\r\nconclusion that in cancer we have to deal with a process of revolt of a\r\npart of the body against the remainder, \"a rebellion of the cells,\" as\r\nan eminent surgeon-philosopher terms it. Unwelcome, because a man's\r\nworst foes are \"they of his own household.\" Successful and even\r\ninvigorating warfare can be waged against enemies without, but a contest\r\nwith traitors within dulls the spear and paralyzes the arm. Against the\r\nfrankly foreign epidemic enemies of the race a sturdy and, of late\r\nyears, a highly successful battle has been fought. We have banished the\r\nplague, drawn the teeth of smallpox, riddled the armor of diphtheria,\r\nand robbed consumption of half its terrors. In spite of the ravings and\r\ngallery-play of the Lombroso school anent \"degeneracy,\" our bills of\r\nmortality show a marked diminution in the fatality of almost every\r\nimportant disease of external origin which afflicts humanity.\r\n\r\nThe world-riddle of pathology the past twenty years has been: Is cancer\r\ndue to the invasion of a parasite, a veritable microscopic crab, or is\r\nit due to alterations in the communal relations, or, to speak\r\nmetaphorically, the allegiance of the cells? Disappointing as it may be,\r\nthe balance of proof and the opinion of the ablest and broadest-minded\r\nexperts are against the parasitic theory, so far, and becoming more\r\ndecidedly so. In other words, cancer appears to be an evil which the\r\nbody breeds within itself.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no adequate ground for the tone of lamentation and\r\nthe Cassandra-like prophecy which pervade all popular, and a\r\nconsiderable part of medical, discussion of the race aspects of the\r\ncancer problem. The reasoning of most of these Jeremiahs is something on\r\nthis wise: That, inasmuch as the deaths from cancer have apparently\r\nnearly trebled in proportion to the population within the last thirty\r\nyears, it only needs a piece of paper and a pencil to be able to figure\r\nout with absolute certainty that in a certain number of decades, at this\r\ngeometric ratio, there will be more deaths from cancer than there are\r\nhuman beings living.\r\n\r\nThere could be no more striking illustration, both of the dangerousness\r\nof \"a little knowledge\" and of the absurdity of applying rigid logic to\r\npremises which contain a large percentage of error. Too blind a\r\nconfidence in the inerrancy of logic is almost as dangerous as\r\nsuperstition. Space will not permit us to enter into details, but\r\nsuffice it to say:--\r\n\r\nFirst, that expert statisticians are in grave doubt whether this\r\nincrease is real or only apparent, due to more accurate diagnosis and\r\nmore complete recording of all cases occurring. Certainly a large\r\nproportion of it is due to the gross imperfection of our records thirty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nSecond, that the apparent increase is little greater than that of deaths\r\ndue to other diseases of later life, such as nervous, kidney, and heart\r\ndiseases. Our heaviest saving of life so far is in the first five-year\r\nperiod, and more children are surviving to reach the cancer and Bright's\r\ndisease age.\r\n\r\nThird, that a disease, eighty per cent of whose death-rate occurs after\r\nforty-five years of age, is scarcely likely to threaten the continued\r\nexistence of the race.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the process is a revolt of a group of cells. The cause of\r\nit is legion, for it embraces any influence which may detach the cell\r\nfrom its normal surroundings,--\"isolate it,\" as one pathologist\r\nexpresses it. The cure is early and complete amputation of not only the\r\nrebellious cells, but of the entire organ or region in which they occur.\r\n\r\nA cancer is a biologic anomaly. Everywhere else in the cell-state we\r\nfind each organ, each part, strictly subordinated, both in form and\r\nfunction, to the interests of the whole.\r\n\r\nHere this relation is utterly disregarded. In the body-republic, where\r\nwe have come to regard harmony and loyalty as the invariable rule, we\r\nfind ourselves suddenly confronted by anarchy and revolt.\r\n\r\nThe process begins in one great class of cells, the epithelium of the\r\nsecreting glands. This is a group of cell-citizens of the highest rank,\r\ndescended originally from the great primitive skin-sheet, which have\r\nformed themselves into chemical laboratories, ferment-factories for the\r\nproduction of the various secretions required by the body, from the\r\nsimplest watery mucus, as in the mouth, or the mere lubricant, as in the\r\nfat-glands of the hair-follicles, to the most complex gastric or\r\npancreatic juice. They form one of the most active and important groups\r\nin the body, and their revolt is dangerous in proportion.\r\n\r\nThe movement of the process is usually somewhat upon this order: After\r\nforty, fifty, or even sixty years of loyal service, the cells lining one\r\nof the tubules of a gland--for instance, of the lip, or tongue, or\r\nstomach--begin to grow and increase in number. Soon they block up the\r\ngland-tube, then begin to push out in the form of finger-or root-like\r\ncolumns of cells into the surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\nThese columns appear to have the curious power of either turning their\r\nnatural digestive ferments against the surrounding tissues, or secreting\r\nnew ferments for the purpose, closely resembling pepsin, and thus\r\nliterally eating their way into them. So rapidly do these cells continue\r\nto breed and grow and spread resistlessly in every direction, that soon\r\nthe entire gland, and next the neighboring tissues, become packed and\r\nswollen, so that a hard lump is formed, the pressure upon the\r\nnerve-trunks gives rise to shooting pains, and the first act of the\r\ndrama is complete.\r\n\r\nBut these new columns and masses, like most other results of such rapid\r\ncell-breeding in the body, are literally a mushroom growth. Scarcely are\r\nthey formed before they begin to break down, with various results. If\r\nthey lie near a surface, either external or internal, they crumble under\r\nthe slightest pressure or irritation, and an ulcer is formed, which may\r\neither spread slowly over the surface, from the size of a shilling to\r\nthat of a dinner-plate, or deepen so rapidly as to destroy the entire\r\norgan, or perforate a blood-vessel and cause death by hemorrhage. The\r\ncancer is breaking down in its centre, while it continues to grow and\r\nspread at its edge. Truly a \"magnificent scheme of decay.\"\r\n\r\nThen comes the last and strangest act of this weird tragedy. In the\r\ncourse of the resistless onward march of these rebel cell-columns some\r\nof their skirmishers push through the wall of a lymph-channel, or even,\r\nby some rare chance, a vein, and are swept away by the stream. Surely\r\nnow the regular leucocyte cavalry have them at their mercy, and can cut\r\nthem down at leisure. We little realize the fiendish resourcefulness of\r\nthe cancer-cell. One such adrift in the body is like a ferret in a\r\nrabbit warren; no other cell can face it for an instant. It simply\r\nfloats unmolested along the lymph-channels until its progress is\r\narrested in some way, when it promptly settles down wherever it may\r\nhappen to have landed, begins to multiply and push out columns in every\r\ndirection, into and at the expense of the surrounding tissues, and\r\nbehold, a new cancer, or \"secondary nodule,\" is born (_metastasis_).\r\n\r\nIn fact, it is a genuine \"animal spore,\" or seed-cell, capable of taking\r\nroot and reproducing its kind in any favorable soil; and, unfortunately,\r\nalmost every inch of a cancer patient's body seems to be such. It is\r\nmerely a question of where the spore-cells happen to drift and lodge.\r\nThe lymph-nodes or \"settling basins\" of the drainage area of the primary\r\ncancer are the first to become infected, probably in an attempt to check\r\nthe invaders; but the spores soon force their way past them toward the\r\ncentral citadels of the body, and, one after another, the great, vital\r\norgans--the liver, the lungs, the spleen, the brain--are riddled by the\r\ndeadly columns and choked by decaying masses of new cells, until the\r\nfunctions of one of them are so seriously interfered with that death\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nObviously, this is a totally different process, not merely in degree,\r\nbut in kind, from anything that takes place as a result of the invasion\r\nof the body by an infectious germ or parasite of any sort. There is a\r\ncertain delusive similarity between the cancer process and an infection.\r\nBut the more closely and carefully this similarity is examined the more\r\nsuperficial and unreal does it become. The invading germ may multiply\r\nchiefly at one point or focus, like cancer, and from this spread\r\nthroughout the body and form new foci, and may even produce swarms of\r\nmasses of cells resembling tumors, as, for instance, in tuberculosis and\r\nsyphilis. But here the analogy ends.\r\n\r\nThe great fundamental difference between cancer and any infection lies\r\nin the fact that, in an infection, the inflammations and poisonings and\r\nlocal swellings are due solely and invariably to the presence and\r\nmultiplication of the invading germs, which may be recovered in millions\r\nfrom every organ and region affected, while swellings or new masses\r\nproduced are merely the outpouring of the body-cells in an attempt to\r\nattack and overwhelm these invaders. In cancer, on the contrary, the\r\ndestroying organism is a group of perverted body-cells. The invasion of\r\nother parts of the body is carried out by transference of their bastard\r\nand abortive offspring. Most significant of all, the new growths and\r\nswellings that are formed in other parts of the body are composed, not\r\nof the outpourings of the local tissues, but of _the descendants of\r\nthese pirate cells_. This is one of the most singular and incredible\r\nthings about the cancer process: that a cancer starting, say, in the\r\npancreas, and spreading to the brain, will there pile up a mass--not of\r\nbrain-cells, or even of connective tissue-cells--but of gland-cells,\r\nresembling crudely the organ in which it was born. So far will this\r\nresemblance go that a secondary cancer of the pancreas found in the lung\r\nwill yield on analysis large amounts of trypsin, the digestive ferment\r\nof the pancreas. Similarly a cancer of the rectum, invading the liver,\r\nwill there pile up in the midst of the liver-tissue abortive attempts at\r\nbuilding up glands of intestinal mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThis fundamental and vital difference between the two processes is\r\nfurther illustrated by this fact: While an ordinary infection may be\r\ntransferred from one individual to another, not merely of the same\r\nspecies, but of half a dozen different species, with perfect certainty,\r\nand for any number of successive generations, no case of cancer has ever\r\nyet been known to be transferred from one human being to another. In\r\nother words, the cancer-cell appears utterly unable to live in any other\r\nbody except the one in which it originated.\r\n\r\nSo confident have surgeons and pathologists become of this that a score\r\nof instances are on record where physicians and pathologists, among them\r\nthe famous surgeon-pathologist, Senn, of Chicago, only a few years ago,\r\nhave voluntarily ingrafted portions of cancerous tissue from patients\r\ninto their own arms, with absolutely no resulting growth. In fact, the\r\ncancer-cell behaves like every other cell of the normal body, in that,\r\nthough portions of it can be grafted into appropriate places in the\r\nbodies of other human beings and live for a period of days, or even\r\nmonths, they ultimately are completely absorbed and disappear. The only\r\napparent exception is the epithelium of the skin, which can be used in\r\ngrafting or skinning over a wide raw surface in another individual.\r\nHowever, even here the probability appears to be that the taking root of\r\nthe foreign cells is only temporary, and makes a preliminary covering or\r\nprotection for the surface until the patient's own skin-cells can\r\nmultiply fast and far enough to take its place.\r\n\r\nA similarly reassuring result has been obtained in animals. Not a single\r\nauthenticated case is on record of the transference of a human cancer to\r\none of the lower animals; and of all the thousands and thousands of\r\nexperiments that have been made in attempting to transfer cancers from\r\none animal to another, only one variety of tumor with the microscopic\r\nappearance of cancer--the so-called Jensen's tumor of mice--has yet been\r\nfound which can be transferred from one animal to another.\r\n\r\nSo we may absolutely disabuse our minds of the fear which some of our\r\nenthusiastic believers in the parasitic theory of cancer have done much\r\nto foster, that there is any danger of cancer \"spreading,\" like an\r\ninfectious disease. Disastrous and gruesome as are the conditions\r\nproduced by this disease, they are absolutely free from danger to those\r\nliving with or caring for the unfortunate victim. In the hundreds of\r\nthousands of cases of cancers which have been treated, in private\r\npractice, in general hospitals, and in hospitals devoted exclusively to\r\ntheir care, not a single case is on record of the transference of the\r\ndisease to a husband, wife, or child, nurse or medical attendant. So\r\nthat the cancer problem, like the Kingdom of Heaven, is within us.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is further supported by the disappointing result of the\r\nmagnificent crusade of research for the discovery of the cancer\r\n\"parasite,\" whether vegetable or animal, which has been pursued with a\r\nsplendid enthusiasm, industry, and ability by the best blood and brains\r\nof the pathological world for twenty years past. I say disappointing,\r\nbecause a positive result--the discovery and identification of a\r\nparasite which causes cancer--would be one of the greatest boons that\r\ncould be granted to humanity; not so much on account of the actual loss\r\nof life produced by the disease as for the agonies of apprehension\r\nengendered by the fact of the absolute remorselessness and blindness\r\nwith which it may strike, and our comparative powerlessness to cure. So\r\nfar the results have been distressingly uniform and hopelessly negative.\r\n\r\nScores, yes, hundreds, of different organisms have been discovered in\r\nand about cancerous growths, and announced by the proud discoverer as\r\nthe cause of cancer. Not one of these, however, has stood the test of\r\nbeing able to produce a similiar growth by inoculation into another\r\nbody; and all which have been deemed worthy of a test-research by other\r\ninvestigators besides the paternal one have been found to be mere\r\naccidental contaminations, and present in a score of other diseases, or\r\neven in normal conditions. Many of them have been shown to be abnormal\r\nproducts of the cells of the body in the course of the cancer process,\r\nand some even such ludicrous misfits as impurities in the chemical\r\nreagents used, scrapings from the corks of bottles, dust from the air,\r\nor even air-bubbles. These \"discoveries\" have ranged the whole realm of\r\nunicellular life,--bacilli, bacteria, spirilla, yeasts, moulds,\r\nprotozoa,--yet the overwhelming judgment of broad-minded and reputable\r\nexperts the world over is the Scotch verdict of \"not proven\"; and we are\r\nmore and more coming to turn our attention to the other aspect of the\r\nproblem, the factors which cause or condition this isolation and\r\nassumption of autonomy on the part of the cells.\r\n\r\nThis is not by any means to say that there is no causative organism, and\r\nthat this will not some day be discovered. Human knowledge is a blind\r\nand short-sighted thing at best, and it may be that some invading cell,\r\nwhich, from its very similarity to the body-cells, has escaped our\r\nsearch, will one day be discovered. Nor will the investigators diminish\r\none whit of their vigor and enthusiasm on account of their failure thus\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nThe most strikingly suggestive proof of the native-born character of\r\ncancer comes from two of its biologic characters. The first is that its\r\nhabit of beginning with a mass formation, rapidly deploying into columns\r\nand driving its way into the tissues in a ghastly flying wedge, is\r\nsimply a perfect imitation and repetition of the method by which glands\r\nare formed during the development of the body. The flat, or epithelial,\r\ncells of the lining of the stomach, for instance, begin to pile up in a\r\nlittle swarm, or mass, elongate into a column, push their way down into\r\nthe deeper tissue, and then hollow out in their interior to form a\r\ntubular gland. The only thing that cancer lacks is the last step of\r\nforming a tube, and thereby becoming a servant of the body instead of a\r\nparasite upon it.\r\n\r\nNor is this process confined to our embryonic or prenatal existence.\r\nTake any gland which has cause to increase in size during adult life,\r\nas, for instance, the mammary gland, in preparation for lactation, and\r\nyou will find massing columns and nests of cells pushing out into the\r\nsurrounding tissue in all directions, in a way that is absolutely\r\nundistinguishable in its earlier stages from the formation of cancer. It\r\nis a fact of gruesome significance that the two organs--the mammary\r\ngland and the uterus--in which this process habitually takes place in\r\nadult life are the two most fatally liable to the attack of cancer.\r\n\r\nAnother biologic character is even more striking and significant. A\r\ncouple of years ago it was discovered by Murray and Bashford, of the\r\nEnglish Imperial Cancer Research Commission, that the cells of cancer,\r\nin their swift and irregular reproduction, showed an unexpected\r\npeculiarity. In the simplest form of reproduction, one cell cutting\r\nitself in two to make two new ones, known as mitosis, the change begins\r\nin the nucleus, or kernel. This kernel splits itself up into a series of\r\nthreads or loops, known as the chromosomes, half of which go into each\r\nof the daughter cells. When, however, sex is born and a male germ-cell\r\nunites with a female germ-cell to form a new organism, each cell\r\nproceeds, as the first step in the process, to get rid of half of these\r\nchromosomes, so that the new organism has precisely the normal number of\r\nchromosomes, half of which are derived from the father and the other\r\nhalf from the mother germ-cell. This, by the way, is the mechanical\r\nbasis of heredity.\r\n\r\nIt has been long known that the mitotic processes of cancer and the\r\nforming and dividing of the chromosomes were riotous and irregular, like\r\nthe rest of its growth. But it was reserved for these investigators to\r\ndiscover the extraordinary fact that the majority of dividing and\r\nmultiplying cancer-cells had, instead of the normal number of\r\nchromosomes, exactly half the quota. In other words, they had resumed\r\nthe powers of the germ, or sexual, cells from which the entire body was\r\noriginally built up, and were, like them, capable of an indefinite\r\namount of multiplication and reproduction. How extraordinary and\r\nlimitless this power is may be seen from the fact that a little group of\r\ncancer-cells grafted into a mouse to produce a Jensen tumor, from which\r\na graft is again taken and transplanted into another mouse, and so on,\r\nis capable, in a comparatively few generations, of producing cancerous\r\nmasses a thousand times the weight of the original mouse in which the\r\ntumor started!\r\n\r\nIn short, cancer-cells are obviously a small, isolated group of the\r\nbody-cells, which in a ghastly fashion have found the fountain of\r\nperpetual youth, and can ride through and over the law-abiding citizens\r\nof the body-state with the primitive vigor of the dawn of life.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the most practical and important questions of the\r\nproblem: What are the influences which condition this isolation and\r\noutlawry of the cells? What can we do to prevent or suppress the\r\nrebellion? To the first of these science can only return a tentative and\r\napproximate answer. The subject is beset with difficulties, chief among\r\nwhich is the fact that we are unable to produce the disease with\r\ncertainty in animals, with the single exception of the Jensen's tumors\r\nin mice referred to, nor is it transferred from one human being to\r\nanother, so that we can make even an approximate guess at the precise\r\ntime at, or conditions under, which the process began.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been advanced, but most investigators who have\r\nstudied the problem in a broad-minded spirit are coming gradually to\r\nagree to this extent:--\r\n\r\nFirst of all, that one of the most powerful influences conditioning this\r\nisolation and revolt of the cells is age, both of the individual and of\r\nthe organ concerned. Not only does far the heaviest cancer mortality\r\nfall between the ages of forty-five and sixty, but the organs most\r\nfrequently and severely attacked are those which between these years are\r\nbeginning to lose their function and waste away. First and most\r\nstriking, the mammary gland and the uterus in women, and the shriveling\r\nlips and tongue of elderly men. To put it metaphorically, the mammary\r\ngland and the uterus, after the change of life, the lip, after the decay\r\nof the teeth, have done their work, outlived their usefulness, and are\r\nbeing placed upon a starvation pension by a grateful country. Nineteen\r\nout of twenty accept the situation without protest and sink slowly to a\r\nmere vegetative state of existence, but, in the twentieth, some little\r\nknot of cells rebel, revert to an ancestral power of breeding rapidly to\r\nescape extinction, begin to make ravages, and cancer is born.\r\n\r\nThe age-preferences are well marked. Cancer is emphatically a disease of\r\nsenility, of age; but, as Roger Williams has pointed out in his\r\nadmirable monograph, not of \"completed\" senility.\r\n\r\nTo express it in percentages, barely twenty per cent of the cases occur\r\nbefore forty years of age, sixty per cent between forty and sixty, and\r\ntwenty per cent between sixty and eighty. Thus the early period of\r\ndecline, the transition stage between full functional vigor and declared\r\natrophy (wasting) of the glands, is clearly the period of greatest\r\ndanger; precisely the period in which the gland-cells, though losing\r\ntheir function,--and income,--have still the strength to inaugurate a\r\nrebellion, and a sufficient supply of the sinews of war, either in their\r\nown possession or within easy striking distance in the tissues about\r\nthem, to make it successful. Not less than sixty-five to seventy-five\r\nper cent of all cancers in women occur in atrophying organs, the uterus\r\nand mammary glands.\r\n\r\nA rather alluring suggestion was made by Cohnheim, years ago, that\r\ncancers might be due to the sudden resumption of growth on the part of\r\nislands or _rests_ of embryonic tissue, left scattered about in various\r\nparts of the body. But these are now believed to play but a small part,\r\nif indeed any, in the production of true cancer.\r\n\r\nFinally, what can be done to prevent or cure this grotesque yet deadly\r\nprocess? So far as it is conditioned by age, it is, of course, obvious\r\nthat little can be done, for not even the most radical vivisector would\r\npropose preventing in any way as large a proportion as possible of the\r\nhuman race from reaching fifty or sixty, or even seventy years, to avoid\r\nthe barely six per cent liability to cancer after forty-five.\r\n\r\nAs regards the influence of chronic inflammations and irritation, much\r\ncan be done, and here is our most hopeful field for prevention. Warts\r\nand birthmarks that are in any way subject to pressure or friction from\r\nclothing or movements should be promptly removed, as both show a\r\ndistinctly greater tendency than normal tissue to develop into cancer.\r\nCracks, fissures, chafes, and ulcers of all sorts, especially about the\r\nlips, tongue, mammary gland, uterus, and rectum, should be early and\r\naseptically dealt with. Jagged remnants of teeth should be removed, all\r\nsuppurative processes of the gums antiseptically treated, and the whole\r\nmouth-parts kept in a thoroughly aseptic condition.\r\n\r\nThorough and conscientious attention to this sort of surgical toilet\r\nwork is valuable, not only for its preventive effect,--which is\r\nconsiderable,--but also because it will insure the bringing under\r\ncompetent observation at the earliest possible moment the beginnings of\r\ntrue cancer.\r\n\r\nFor the disease itself, after it has once started, there is, like\r\ntreason in the body-politic, but one remedy--capital punishment.\r\nParleying with the rebels is worse than useless. Pastes, caustics,\r\nX-rays, trypsin, radium,--all are fatally defective, because they\r\nsuppress a symptom only and leave the cause untouched. Only in one form\r\nof surface-cancer, the so-called flat-celled or rodent ulcer, which has\r\nlittle or no tendency to form spore-cells and attack the deeper organs,\r\nare they effective.\r\n\r\nNothing is easier and nothing more idle than to destroy and break down\r\ncells which have actually become cancerous; but so long as there remains\r\nin the body a single nest, or even cell, of the organ in which the\r\nrevolt started, so long the life of the patient is in danger.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely the only remedy which is of the slightest value is complete\r\nremoval with the knife. The one superiority of the knife, shudder as we\r\nmay at the name of it, over every other means of removal lies solely in\r\nthis fact, that with it can be removed not merely the actual cancer, but\r\nthe entire gland or group of surrounding cells in which this malignant,\r\nparricidal change has begun to occur.\r\n\r\nThe modern radical operations for cancer take not merely the tumor, but\r\nthe entire diseased breast, for instance, and all the lymph-glands into\r\nwhich it drains, clear up into the armpit, with the muscles beneath it\r\ndown to the ribs. Where this is done early enough, the disease does not\r\nrecur. Such radical and complete amputation of an organ or region as\r\nthis is possible in from two-thirds to three-fourths of all cases if\r\nseen reasonably early.\r\n\r\nWith watchfulness and courage, our attitude toward the cancer problem is\r\none of hopeful confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nHEADACHE: THE MOST USEFUL PAIN IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nGreatness always has its penalties. Other ills besides death love a\r\nshining mark. Pain is one of them, and headache its best exemplar. If\r\nthere be one thing about our bodies of which we are peculiarly and\r\ninordinately proud it is that expanded brain-bulb which we call the\r\nhead. Yet it aches oftener than all the rest of us put together.\r\nHeadache is the commonest of all pains, which fact gives the slight\r\nconsolation that everybody can sympathize with you when you have it. One\r\ntouch of headache makes the whole world kin, and the man or woman who\r\nhas never had it would be looked upon as a creature abnormal and \"a\r\nthing apart.\" It has even become incorporated into our social fabric as\r\none of the sacred institutions of the game of polite society. How could\r\nwe possibly protect ourselves against our instructors in youth and our\r\nwould-be friends in later life if there were no such words as \"a severe\r\nheadache\"?\r\n\r\nWhat is a headache, and why does it ache the head? This is a wide and\r\nhotly disputed problem. But one fact, which is obvious at the first\r\nintelligent glance, becomes clearer and more important with deeper\r\nstudy, and that is that it _is not the fault of the head_. When the head\r\naches, it is, nine times out of ten, simply doing a combination of\r\nscapegoat and fire-alarm duty for the rest of the body. Just as the\r\nbrain is the servant of the body, rather than its master, so the devoted\r\nhead meekly offers itself as a sort of vicarious atonement for the sins\r\nof the entire body. It is the eloquent spokesman of such \"mute,\r\ninglorious Miltons\" as the stomach, the liver, the muscles, and the\r\nheart. The humblest and least distinguished of all the organs of the\r\nbody can order the lordly head to ache for it, and the head has no\r\nalternative but to obey.\r\n\r\nTo discuss the cause of headaches is like discussing the cause of the\r\nhuman species. It is one of the commonest facts of every-day\r\nobservation, and can be demonstrated almost at will, that any one of a\r\nhundred different causes,--a stuffy room, a broken night's sleep, a\r\ntroublesome letter, a few extra hours of work, eating something that\r\ndisagrees, a cold, a glare of light in the eyes,--any and all of these\r\nmay bring on a headache. The problem of avoiding headaches is the\r\nproblem of the whole conduct of life.\r\n\r\nTwo or three broad generalizations, however, can be made from the\r\nconfused and enormous mass of data at our disposal, which are of both\r\nphilosophic interest and practical value. One of these is that, while\r\nheadache is felt in the head, and particularly in those regions that lie\r\nover the brain, the brain has comparatively little to do with the pain.\r\nHeadache is neither a mark of intellectuality, nor, with rare\r\nexceptions, a sign of cerebral disturbance. Indeed, it is far more a\r\nmatter of the digestion, the muscles, and the ductless glands, than it\r\nis of the brain, or even of the nervous system. It is, therefore, idle\r\nto endeavor either to treat or try to prevent it by measures directed\r\nto the head, the brain, or even the nervous system as such.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is coming to be more and more clearly recognized that,\r\nwhile its causes are legion, a very large percentage of these\r\npractically and eventually operate by producing a toxic, or poisoned,\r\ncondition of the blood, which, circulating through certain delicate and\r\nsensitive nerve-strands in the head and face, give rise to the sensation\r\nof pain.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the tissues which give out this pain-cry under the torture of\r\nthe toxins in the blood are, in a large majority of cases, neither the\r\nbrain, nor the nerves of the eye, nor other special senses, but the\r\nnerves of common sensation which supply the face, the scalp, and the\r\nstructures of the head generally, most of them derived from one great\r\npair of nerve-trunks, the so-called _Trigeminus_, or fifth pair of\r\ncranial nerves. Strange as it may seem, the brain substance is\r\ncomparatively insensitive to pain, and the acutest pain of an operation\r\nupon it, such as for the removal of a tumor, is over when the skin and\r\nscalp have been cut through. These poisons, of course, go all over the\r\nbody, wherever the circulation goes, but they produce their promptest\r\nand loudest pain outcry, so to speak, in the region where the nerves are\r\nmost exquisitely sensitive. When your head aches, nine times out of ten\r\nyour whole body is suffering, but other regions of it are not able to\r\nexpress themselves so promptly and so clearly.\r\n\r\nThese newer and clearer views of the nature of headache dispose at once\r\nof some of the most time-honored controversies in regard to its nature.\r\nIn my student-days one of the most hotly debated problems in medicine\r\nwas as to whether headaches were due to lack of blood (anæmia) or excess\r\nof blood (hyperæmia) in the brain. Few things could have been more\r\nnatural for both the sufferer in, and the observer of, a case of\r\nthrobbing, bursting headache, where every pulse-beat is registered as a\r\nthrill of agony, than to draw the conclusion that the pain was due to a\r\nhuge engorgement and swelling of the brain with blood, resulting in\r\nagonizing pressure against its rigid, bony skull-walls.\r\n\r\nOne of the most naïve and vivid illustrations of this conception of\r\nheadache is the remedy adopted for generations past, in this all too\r\nfamiliar and distressing condition, by the Irish peasantry. It consists\r\nof a band or strip of tough cloth, or better, of twisted or plaited\r\nstraw, which is tied around the head and then tightened vigorously by\r\nmeans of a stick inserted tourniquet fashion. This is believed to\r\nprevent the head, which is aching \"fit to split,\" from actually bursting\r\nopen, and is considered a cure of wondrous merit through many a\r\ncountryside. Ludicrous as is the reason which is gravely assigned for\r\nits use, it does, in some cases, greatly relieve the pain, a fact which\r\nwe were entirely at a loss to account for until our later knowledge\r\nshowed us that the pain, instead of being inside the skull, was outside\r\nof it in the sensitive nerves supplying the scalp. By steady pressure of\r\nthis sort upon the trunks of these nerves, pressing them against the\r\nbone, they can be gradually numbed into a condition of anæsthesia, when\r\nnaturally the pain would diminish.\r\n\r\nIn politer circles a similar misapprehension has also given rise to a\r\nfavorite form of treatment. That is the application of cold in the form\r\nof the classic wet cloth sprinkled with _eau de Cologne_. The mere\r\nmention of headache calls up in the minds of most of us memories of a\r\ndarkened room, a pale face on the pillow with a ghastly bandage over the\r\neyes, and a pervading smell of _eau de Cologne_. It was a perfectly\r\nnatural conclusion that, because the head throbbed and felt hot and\r\nbursting, there must be some inflammation, or at least congestion,\r\npresent, and that the application of cold would relieve this. The\r\nresults seemed to justify this belief, for in many cases the sense of\r\ncoolness to the aching head gives great relief; but this is apt to be\r\nonly temporary, and in really severe cases makes the situation worse by\r\nadding another depressing influence--cold--to the toxin-burdens that are\r\nweighing upon the tortured nerves. The chief virtue in these cold cloths\r\nand handkerchiefs soaked in cologne was that you were compelled to lie\r\ndown and keep perfectly still in order to keep them on, while at the\r\nsame time they mechanically blindfolded you. Few better devices for\r\nautomatically insuring that absolute rest, which is the best and only\r\nrational cure for a headache, have ever been invented.\r\n\r\nWe were not long in discovering that headaches, both of the mildest and\r\nthe severest types, might be accompanied either by a rush of blood to\r\nthe head, with flushing of the skin, reddening of the eyes, and a\r\nbursting sense of oppression in the head, or, on the other hand, by an\r\nabsolute draining of the whole floating surplus of the blood into the\r\nso-called \"abdominal pool,\" the huge network of vessels supplying the\r\ndigestive organs, which, when distended, will contain nearly two-thirds\r\nof the entire blood of the body, leaving the face blanched, the eyes\r\nwhite and staring, and the brain so nearly emptied of blood as to cause\r\nloss of consciousness or swooning. Other headaches, again, will be\r\naccompanied by a fresh, natural color and a perfectly normal and healthy\r\ndistribution of the blood-supply. In short, the amount of blood in the\r\nhead, whether plus or minus, has practically nothing to do with the\r\npain, but depends solely upon the effect of the poisons producing it\r\nupon the heart and great blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nA good illustration of the full-blooded type of headache is that which\r\nso very frequently, indeed almost invariably, occurs in the early stage\r\nof a fever or other acute infection, such as typhoid, pneumonia, or\r\nblood-poisoning, Here the face is red, the eyes are bloodshot and\r\nabnormally bright, the pulse is rapid and full, the headache so severe\r\nas to become the first disabling symptom in the disease,--all because\r\nthis is the effect of the poison (toxin) of the disease upon the heart,\r\nthe temperature, and the surface blood-vessels. Fortunately for the\r\nsufferer, this head-pain, like most others in the course of severe\r\ninfections, is only preliminary, for as soon as the tissues of the body\r\nhave become thoroughly saturated with the toxins, the nerves become\r\ndulled and semi-narcotized, so that they no longer respond with the\r\npain-cry. As the patient settles down into the depression and dullness\r\nof the regular course of the fever, the headache usually subsides into\r\nlittle more than a sense of heaviness, or oppression and vague\r\ndiscomfort.\r\n\r\nMoral: It is a sign of health to be able to feel a headache, an\r\nindication that your body is still fighting vigorously against the\r\nenemy, whether traitor within or foe without.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many of our most agonizing, and particularly our most\r\npersistent and obstinate headaches, occur in individuals who are\r\nmarkedly anæmic, with a low, weak pulse, poor circulation, blanched\r\nlips, and dull, lackluster eyes. The one and only thing in common\r\nbetween these two classes of \"head-achers\" is that their blood and\r\ntissues are loaded with poisons. Whether produced by invading germs or\r\nby starvation and malnutrition of the body-tissues makes no difference\r\nto the headache nerves. Their business, like good watchdogs, is to bark\r\nevery time they smell danger of any sort, whether it be bears or\r\nbook-agents. One of the most valuable services rendered us by our\r\npriceless heads is aching.\r\n\r\nThis view of the nature of headache explains at once why it is so\r\nextraordinarily frequent and so extraordinarily varied in causation. It\r\nis not too much to say that _any_ influence that injuriously affects the\r\nbody may cause a headache. It would, of course, be idle even to attempt\r\nto enumerate the different causes and kinds of this pain, as it would\r\ninvolve a review of the entire environment of the human species,\r\ninternal and external. It makes not the slightest difference how the\r\npoison gets into the blood, or where it starts. A piece of tainted meat\r\nor a salad made from spoiled tomatoes will produce a headache just as\r\npromptly and effectively as an over-exposure to the July sun or an\r\nattack of influenza. It is even practically impossible to pick out from\r\nsuch a wealth of origins two or three, or even a score of, conditions\r\nwhich are the most frequent, most important, or the most interesting\r\ncauses. The most exasperating thing about dealing with a headache is\r\nthat we never know, until its history has been most carefully examined,\r\nwhether we have to do with a mere temporary expression of discomfort and\r\nunbalance, due to overfatigue, errors in diet, a stuffy room, lack of\r\nexercise, or what-not, which can be promptly relieved by removing the\r\ncause; or whether we have to deal with the first symptoms of a dangerous\r\nfever, the beginning of a nervous breakdown, or an early warning of some\r\ngrave trouble in kidneys, liver, or heart.\r\n\r\nThe one thing, however, that stands out clearly is that _headache always\r\nmeans something_; that it should be promptly and thoroughly investigated\r\nwith a view to finding and removing the cause,--never as something which\r\nis to be cured as quickly as possible, as the police cure social\r\ndiscontent, by clubbing it over the head, with some narcotic or other\r\nsymptom-smotherer. Nor should it be regarded as a malady so trifling\r\nthat it is best treated with contempt, and still less as a mere \"thorn\r\nin the flesh,\" whose ignoring is to be counted a virtue, or whose\r\npatient endurance without sign a mark of saintship. Martyrdom is\r\nmagnificent when it is necessary, but many forms of it are sheer\r\nstupidity. Don't either gulp down some capsule, or \"grin and bear it.\"\r\nLook for the cause. The more trivial it is, the easier it will be to\r\ndiscover and remove before serious harm has been done. The less easy you\r\nfind it to put your finger upon it, the more likely it is to be serious\r\nor chronic, and the more necessary it is to remove it.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, we have clearly recognized that no headache should be\r\ntreated too lightly or indifferently, it may be frankly admitted that\r\npractically the vast majority of headaches in which we are keenly\r\ninterested--that is, the kind that we individually or the members of our\r\nfamily habitually indulge in--do form a moderately uniform class among\r\nthe hundreds of varieties, and are in the main due to some six or seven\r\ngreat groups of causes. We have learned by repeated and unpleasant\r\nexperience that they are very apt to \"come on\" in about a certain way,\r\nafter a certain set of circumstances; that they last about so long, that\r\nthey are made worse by such and such things, that they are helped by\r\nother things, and that they generally get better after a good night's\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest causes of this group of recurrent and self-limited\r\nheadaches is fatigue, whether bodily, mental, or emotional. This was\r\nlong an apparent stumbling-block in the way of a poison theory of\r\nheadache, but now it is one of its best illustrations. Physiologists\r\nyears ago discovered that what produced not merely the sensation but\r\nalso the fact of fatigue, or tiredness, was the accumulation in the\r\nmuscles or nerves of the waste-products of their own activities. Simply\r\nwashing these out with a salt solution would start the utterly fatigued\r\nmuscle contracting again, without any fresh nourishment or even period\r\nfor rest. It has become an axiom with physiologists that fatigue is\r\nsimply a form of self-poisoning, or, as they sonorously phrase it,\r\nautointoxication. One of the reasons why we are so easily fatigued when\r\nwe are already ill, or, as we say, \"out of sorts,\" is that our tissues\r\nare already so saturated with waste-products or other poisons that the\r\nslightest addition of the fatigue poisons is enough to overwhelm them.\r\nThis also explains why our pet variety of headache, which we may have\r\nclearly recognized to be due to overwork or overstrain of some sort,\r\nwhether with eye, brain, or muscles, is so much more easily brought on\r\nby such comparatively small amounts of over-exertion whenever we are\r\nalready below par and out of sorts. People who are \"born tired,\" who are\r\nneurasthenic and easily fatigued and \"ached,\" are probably in a chronic\r\nstate of self-poisoning due to some defect in their body-chemistry.\r\nFurther, the somewhat greater frequency and acuteness of headache in\r\nbrain workers--although the difference between them and muscle workers\r\nin this regard has been exaggerated--is probably due in part to the\r\ngreater sensitiveness of their nerves; but more so to the curious fact,\r\ndiscovered in careful experiments upon the nervous system, that the\r\nfatigue products of the nerve-cells are the deadliest and most powerful\r\npoisons produced in the body. Hence some brain workers can work only a\r\nfew half-hours a day, or even minutes at a time; for instance, Darwin,\r\nSpencer, and Descartes.\r\n\r\nA very frequent cause of these habitual headaches, really a subdivision\r\nof the great fatigue group, is eye-strain. This is due to an abnormal or\r\nimperfect shape of the eye, which is usually present from birth. Hence,\r\nthe only possible way of correcting it is by the addition to the\r\nimperfect eye of carefully fitted lenses or spectacles which will\r\nneutralize this mechanical defect. To put it very roughly, if the eye is\r\ntoo flat to bring the light-rays to a focus upon the retina, which is\r\nfar the commonest condition (the well-known \"long sight,\" or hyperopia),\r\nwe put a plus or bulging glass before the eye and thus correct its\r\nshape. But if the eye is too round and bulging, producing the familiar\r\n\"short sight,\" or myopia, we put a minus or concave lens before the eye,\r\nand thus bring it back to the normal. By a curious paradox, however, it\r\noften happens that the headache due to eye-strain is caused not by the\r\ngrosser defects, such as interfere with vision so seriously as\r\nabsolutely to demand the wearing of glasses to see decently, but from\r\nslighter and more irregular degrees and kinds of misshapenness in the\r\neye, most of which fall under the well-known heading of astigmatism.\r\nThese interfere only slightly with vision, but keep the eye perpetually\r\non the strain, on a twist, as it were, rasping the entire nervous system\r\ninto a state of chronic irritation. Our motto now, in all cases of\r\nchronic headache, is, first examine the patient's habits of life, next\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\nMany forms of headache are really stomach-ache in disguise, due to\r\ndigestive disturbances, the absorption of poisons from the food-tube,\r\nwhether from tainted, spoiled, or decayed foods, as in the now familiar\r\nptomaine poisoning, or from imperfect processes of digestion. The\r\nimmediate effect, however, of diet in the causation of headache is not\r\nso great as we once believed. We have no adequate basis for believing\r\nthat any particular kinds or amounts of food are especially likely to\r\nproduce either headache or what we might call the headache habit, except\r\nin so far as they upset the digestion. In a certain number of\r\nsusceptible individuals, however, it will be found that some particular\r\nkind of food, often perfectly wholesome and harmless in itself, will\r\nbring on an attack of headache whenever it is indulged in. Very\r\nfrequently the disturbances of digestion which are put down as the\r\n_cause_ of a headache are only _symptoms_ of some general constitutional\r\nlack of balance, as eye-strain or neurasthenia, which is the cause of\r\nboth these discomforts. Far fewer headaches can be cured by dieting than\r\nwe at one time believed, and underfeeding is a more frequent cause than\r\novereating.\r\n\r\nBy an odd _bouleversement_ the one type of headache which we have almost\r\nunanimously in the past attributed to digestive disturbances, the\r\nfamous, or, rather, infamous, \"sick headache,\" is now known to have\r\nlittle or nothing to do with the stomach in its origin. In fact,\r\nincredible as it may seem at first sight, it is the headache that causes\r\nthe sickness, not the sickness the headache. Stop the pain of a sick\r\nheadache in the early stage, and the sickness will never develop at all.\r\nThe vomiting of sick headache is an interesting illustration of vomiting\r\ndue to disturbances of the brain and nervous system, technically known\r\nas central vomiting. Another illustration is the vomiting of\r\nseasickness, due solely to dizziness from the gross contradiction\r\nbetween the testimony of our eyes and of the balancing canals in the\r\ninner ear. The stomach or its contents has no more to do with\r\nseasickness than the water in a pump has with the plunger. Injuries to\r\nthe head will bring on severe and uncontrollable vomiting, and the\r\nseverer type of fevers is very frequently ushered in by this curious\r\nsign. As to what it means, we are as yet utterly in the dark, for in\r\nnone of these conditions does the process do the slightest good, but\r\nsimply adds to the discomfort of the situation. It would appear to be a\r\ncurious echo of ancestral times, when the animal was pretty much all\r\nstomach, and hence emptying that organ would probably relieve two-thirds\r\nof his discomforts. Whatever the explanation, the fact remains that\r\nwhenever our nervous system gets about so panic-stricken, it promptly\r\nbegins throwing its cargo overboard, in the blind hope that this may\r\nsomehow relieve the situation. The bile that we bring up at the end of\r\nthese interesting acrobatic performances and which makes us feel so much\r\nbetter,--because we have now got the cause of the trouble out of our\r\nsystem,--is simply due to the prolonged vomiting, which has reversed the\r\nnormal current and caused the perfectly healthy bile from our\r\nunoffending liver to pass upward into the stomach, instead of downward\r\ninto the bowels.\r\n\r\nIn another great group of headaches natural poisons or waste-products\r\nare not burned up or got rid of through the body-sewers and pores as\r\nrapidly as they should be; for instance, the familiar headache from\r\nsitting too long in a stuffy room. Your well-known and well-earned\r\ndiscomfort is, of course, due in part to the irritating and often\r\npoisonous gases, dust, and bacteria, which are present in the air of an\r\nunventilated room; but it is also due to the steady piling up of the\r\nwaste products of your own tissues. These poisons are normally oxidized\r\nin the muscles, burned up and exhaled through the lungs, and sweated out\r\nthrough the skin,--all three of which relief agencies are, of course,\r\npractically paralyzed, or working at lowest possible level, while you\r\nare sitting at your desk.\r\n\r\nThe well-known headache of sluggish bowels is an obvious case in point;\r\nand one of the early signs of beginning failure of the kidneys, as in\r\nBright's disease, is a headache of a peculiar type due to accumulation\r\nin the system of the poisons which it is their duty to get rid of.\r\n\r\nThere are few things the head resents more keenly than loss of sleep.\r\nThe pillow is the best headache medicine. If this loss of sleep be due\r\nto the encroachments of work or of amusements, then the mechanism of its\r\nproduction is obvious. The fatigue poisons produced during the day and\r\nnormally completely neutralized and burned up during sleep are not\r\nentirely disposed of and remain in the tissues to torture the nerves.\r\nThe headache of insomnia, or habitual sleeplessness, on the other hand,\r\nis not, strictly speaking, caused by loss of sleep. Paradoxical as it\r\nmay sound, the fatigue poisons, which in moderate amounts will produce\r\ndrowsiness and promote sleep, in excessive amounts will cause\r\nwakefulness and inability to sleep. Insomnia and headache are usually\r\nsymptoms of this overfatigued, or poisoned, condition, and should both\r\nbe regarded and treated as symptoms by the removal of their causes,\r\n_not_ by the use of coal-tar products and hypnotics.\r\n\r\nAnother common cause of headache is nasal obstruction, such as may be\r\ndue to adenoids or deformities of the septum, or chronic catarrhal\r\nconditions. These probably act by their interference with breathing and\r\nconsequent imperfect ventilation of the blood, as well as by obstruction\r\nand inflammation of the great air-spaces in the bones of the skull,\r\nclosely underlying the brain, which open and drain into the nose.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in passing that \"sick headache,\" or _migraine_,\r\nthough long and painfully familiar to us, is still a puzzle as to its\r\ncause. But the view which seems to come nearest to explaining its many\r\neccentricities is that it is usually due to a congenital defect, not so\r\nmuch of the nervous system as of the entire body, by which the poisons\r\nnormally produced in its processes fail to be neutralized and got rid\r\nof, and gradually accumulate until they saturate the system to such a\r\ndegree as to produce a furious explosion of pain. This defect may quite\r\npossibly be in one of the ductless glands or in some of the internal\r\nsecretions, rather than in the nervous system.\r\n\r\nObviously, after what has been said of the world-wide causation of\r\nheadache, to attempt to discuss its treatment would be as absurd as to\r\nundertake to advise what should be done for the relief of hunger, for\r\n\"that tired feeling,\" or for a pain in the knee. The treatment for a\r\nheadache due to an inflammation or tumor of the brain would, of course,\r\nbe wide as the poles from that which would relieve an ordinary fatigue\r\nor indigestion pain. Besides, it is utterly irrational and often harmful\r\nto attempt _to treat any headache as such_. That is the open road to the\r\nmorphine habit and drug addictions of all sorts. Remedies--and there are\r\nplenty of them--which simply relieve the pain without doing anything to\r\nremove its cause, merely make the latter state of that individual worse\r\nthan the first. Headache is always and everywhere nature's vivid warning\r\nthat something is going wrong, like the shrieking of a wagon-axle or the\r\nclatter of a broken cog in machinery.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, fortunately one remedy which alone will cure\r\nninety-nine per cent of all headaches, and that is rest. The first thing\r\nan intelligent machinist does when squeaking or rattling begins is to\r\nstop the machinery. This has the double advantage of preventing the\r\ndamage from going any further and of enabling him to get at the cause.\r\nHeadache, like pain anywhere, is nature's imperative order _to Halt_, at\r\nleast long enough to find out what you are doing to yourself that you\r\nshouldn't. It makes little difference what you take for your headache,\r\nso long as you follow it up by lying down for an hour or two, or, better\r\nstill, by going to bed for the remainder of the day and sleeping through\r\nuntil the next morning. If more headaches were treated in this way there\r\nwould not only be fewer headaches, but two-thirds of the risks of\r\nnervous breakdown, collapse, insomnia, and chronic degenerative changes\r\nin the liver, kidneys, and blood-vessels would be avoided.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is a counsel of perfection, and incapable of general\r\napplication for the sternest of reasons; but it does indicate the\r\nrational attitude toward headache and its treatment, and one which is\r\ncoming to be more and more adopted. No motorist would dream of pushing\r\nahead with a shrieking axle or a scorching hot box, unless his journey\r\nwere one of most momentous importance or a matter of life and death.\r\nPain is nature's automatic speed regulator. It is often necessary to\r\ndisregard it, to get the work of the world done and to discharge our\r\nsacred obligations to others; but this disregarding should not be\r\nexalted to too high a pinnacle of virtue, and least of all worshiped as\r\ninherently and everywhere a mark of piety and one of the insignia of\r\nsaintship.\r\n\r\nA business firm or a factory, for instance, which would send home for\r\nthe day each of its employees who reported a genuine case of bad\r\nheadache, would, in the long run, save money by avoiding accidents,\r\nmistakes, muddles, and confusions, often involving a whole department,\r\ndue to the kind of work that is done by a man or woman who is physically\r\nunfit to attempt it. And the higher the type of work that has to be\r\ndone, the more the elements of insight, grasp, and sound judgment enter\r\ninto it, the graver and costlier are the mistakes that are likely to be\r\nmade under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nOf course, it will probably be objected at this point: \"What is the use\r\nof wasting a day, or even half a day, when by taking two or three\r\ncapsules of So-and-So's Headache Cure I can get rid of the pain and go\r\nright on with my work?\" It is perfectly true that there are a number of\r\nremedies which will relieve the average headache; but there are two\r\nimportant things to be borne in mind. The first is that all of these are\r\nsimply weaker or stronger nerve-deadeners; most of them actual\r\nnarcotics. All that they do is to stop the pain and thus cheat you into\r\nthe impression that you are better. You are just as tired and as unfit\r\nfor work as you were before. Your nervous system is just as saturated\r\nwith poisons, and the chances are ten to one that the quality of the\r\nwork that you do will be just as bad as if you had taken no medicine.\r\nFurther, like alcohol, when used as a \"pick-me-up\" under somewhat\r\nsimilar conditions, the remedy which you have taken, while producing a\r\nfalse sense of comfort and even exhilaration by deadening your pain and\r\ndiscomfort, in that very process itself takes off the finer edge of your\r\njudgment, the best keenness of your insight, and the highest balance of\r\nyour control. In short, your nervous system has to struggle with all the\r\npoisons that were present before, with another one added to them!\r\n\r\nAfter you have taken nature's wise advice, and obeyed her orders, and\r\nput yourself at rest, then there are a number of mild sedatives, with\r\nwhich every physician is familiar, one of which, according to the\r\nspecial circumstances of your case, it may be perfectly legitimate to\r\ntake in moderate doses, with the approval of a physician, as a means of\r\nrelieving the pain and helping to get that sleep which will complete the\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nOne other measure of relief, which, like rest, is also indicated by\r\ninstinct, is worth mentioning, and that is gentle friction of the head.\r\nOne of the most instinctive tendencies of most of us when suffering from\r\na severe headache is to put the hands to the head, either for the\r\npurpose of frantically clutching at it, rubbing as if our lives depended\r\nupon it, or pressing hard over the aching region. The mere picture of a\r\nman with his head in his hands instantly suggests the idea of headache.\r\nPart of this is, of course, little more than a blind impulse to do\r\nsomething to or with the offending member. We would sometimes like to\r\nthrow it away if we could, or at others to bang it against the wall. But\r\npart of it is due to the discovery, ages ago, that pressure and friction\r\nwould give a certain amount of relief.\r\n\r\nFor some curious reason the nerves most frequently involved are those\r\nwhich are most readily accessible for this kind of treatment, namely,\r\nthe long nerve-threads which run from the inner third of the eyebrow up\r\nthe forehead and over the crown of the head (the so-called supraorbital\r\nor frontal branches). A corresponding pair run up the back of the neck,\r\nabout half-way between the back of the ear and the spinal column,\r\nsupplying the back of the head and the crown (these form the cervical\r\nplexus); and a smaller pair run up just in front of the ear into the\r\ntemple, and from there on upward to join the other two pairs at the top\r\nof the head.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the position of the pain depends upon which pair of\r\nthese nerves is lifting up its voice most vigorously in protest. If it\r\nbe the front pair (supraorbitals) then we get the well-known frontal or\r\nforehead headache; if the back pair (known as the occipitals) then we\r\nhave the deadly, constricting, band-around-the-head pain which clutches\r\nus across the back of the neck and base of the brain. If the lateral\r\npair are chiefly affected then we get the classic throbbing temples.\r\nPractically all of these aches, however, are of the \"fire-alarm\"\r\ncharacter; and while certain of these nerve-gongs show some tendency to\r\nrespond more readily to calls coming in from certain regions of the\r\nbody, as, for instance, the forehead nerves to eye-strain, the\r\nback-of-the-head nerves (occipital) to grave toxic states of the system,\r\nthe tips of any of the nerves in the crown of the head to pelvic\r\ndisturbances and anæmic conditions, the lateral branches in the temples\r\nto diseases of the teeth and throat, yet there is little fixed\r\nuniformity in these relations. Eye-strain, for instance, may cause\r\neither frontal or occipital headache; and, as every one knows from\r\nexperience, the pain may be felt in all parts of the head at once.\r\n\r\nGentle and intelligent massage over the course of these nerves of the\r\nscalp, according to the location of the pain, will often do much to\r\nrelieve the severity of the suffering.\r\n\r\nTreat headache as a danger signal, by rest and the removal of its cause,\r\nand it will prevent at least ten times as much suffering and disability\r\nas it causes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nNERVES AND NERVOUSNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nNerves are real things. In spite of their connection with imaginary\r\ndiseases and mental disturbances, there is nothing imaginary or\r\nunsubstantial about them. There is no more genuine and obstinate malady\r\non earth than a nervous disease. Because nerves lie in that twilight\r\nborderland between mind and matter, body and soul, the real and the\r\nideal, the impression has got abroad that they are little better than\r\nfigures of speech. Though their disturbances give rise to visions of all\r\nsorts there is nothing visionary about them; they are just as genuine\r\nand substantial a part of our bodily structure as our bones, muscles,\r\nand blood-vessels. In fact, it was this very substantiality that at the\r\nbeginning prevented their proper recognition, and handicapped them with\r\ntheir present absurd and inappropriate name.\r\n\r\n\"Nerve\" is from the Greek _neuron_, meaning tendon, or sinew, and was\r\noriginally applied indiscriminately to all the different shining cords\r\nwhich run down the limbs and among the muscles. In fact the first\r\nrecognition of nerves was an utter failure to recognize. The tendon\r\ncords, which are the ropes with which the muscles work the joint\r\npulleys, were actually included under one head with the less numerous\r\nbut almost equally large and tough cords of grayer color, flatter\r\noutline, and less glistening hue, which were afterwards found to be\r\nnerve-trunks. Cutting either paralyzed the limb below the cut,--and what\r\nmore proof could you ask of their having the same function?\r\n\r\nSuch is the persistence of ancient memories, that any physician could\r\ntell you of scores of cases in which he has heard the naïve remark, in\r\nreference most frequently to a deep gash across the wrist, that the\r\n\"nerves\" were cut, and the hand was paralyzed, when what had happened\r\nwas simply that the tendons had been cut across. When, after centuries\r\nof blundering in every possible direction until the right one was\r\nfinally stumbled upon (which is the mechanism of progress), it was\r\nrealized that some of these \"nerves,\" the grayer and flatter ones,\r\ncarried messages instead of pulling ropes, they were still far from\r\nbeing properly understood.\r\n\r\nIt is an amusing illustration of the blissful ignorance and charming\r\nnaïveté which marked their study and discussion at this time, that\r\nnerves were for centuries regarded as hollow tubes, carrying a supply of\r\n\"animal spirits\" from the central reservoir of the brain to the\r\ndifferent limbs. So seriously was this believed, that, in amputations,\r\nthe cut nerve-trunks were carefully sought out and tied, for fear the\r\nvital spirits would leak out and the patient thus literally bleed to\r\ndeath. One can imagine how this must have added to the comfort of the\r\nluckless patient.\r\n\r\nThe term \"nerves\" still persists, in the old sense, in both botany and\r\nentomology, which speak of the \"nerves\" of a butterfly's wing, or the\r\n\"nervation\" of a leaf, meaning simply the branching, fibrous framework\r\nof each.\r\n\r\nIt comes in the nature of a surprise to most of us to learn that\r\n\"nerves\" are real things. I shall never forget the shock of my own first\r\nconvincing demonstration of this fact. It was in one of the first\r\nsurgical clinics that I attended as a medical student. A woman patient\r\nwas brought in, with a history of suffering the tortures of the damned\r\nfor a year past, from an uncontrollable sciatica.\r\n\r\nIt was a recognized procedure in those days (and is resorted to still),\r\nwhen all medical, electrical, and other remedial measures had failed to\r\nrelieve a furious neuralgia, for the surgeon to cut down upon the\r\nnerve-trunk, free it from its surrounding attachments, and, slipping his\r\ntenaculum or finger under it, stretch the nerve with a considerable\r\ndegree of force. Whether it acts by merely setting up some trophic\r\nchange in the nerve-tissue, or by tearing loose inflammatory adhesions\r\nwhich are binding down the nerve-trunk, the procedure gives excellent\r\nresults, nearly always temporary relief, and sometimes a permanent cure.\r\n\r\nThe patient was placed upon the table and anæsthetized, and the surgeon\r\nmade a free, sweeping incision down the back of the thigh, exposing the\r\nsciatic nerve. He thrust his finger into the wound, loosened up the\r\nadhesions about the nerve, hooked two fingers underneath it, and, to my\r\nwide-eyed astonishment, heaved upward upon it, until he brought into\r\nview through the gaping wound a flattened, bluish-gray cord about twice\r\nthe size of a clothesline, with which he proceeded to lift the hips of\r\nthe patient clear of the table. In my ignorant horror, I expected every\r\nmoment to see the thing snap and the patient go down with a bump,\r\nparalyzed for life; but I never doubted after that that nerves were real\r\nthings. Though it has nothing to do with this discussion, for the\r\nbenefit of those of my readers who cannot bear to have a story left\r\nunfinished, I will add that the operation was as successful as it was\r\ndramatic, and the patient left the hospital completely relieved of her\r\nsciatica.\r\n\r\nWhen at last it was clearly recognized that the nerves were concerned in\r\nthe sending of messages from the centre to the brain, known as\r\n_sensory_, or centripetal, and carrying back messages from the brain to\r\nthe muscles and surface, known as _motor_, or centrifugal,--in other\r\nwords that they were the organs of the mind,--still another source of\r\nconfusion sprang up, and that was the determination on the part of some\r\nto regard them from a purely mental and, so to speak, spiritual point of\r\nview, and on the part of others to regard them from a physical and\r\nanatomical point of view. This confusion is of course in full riot at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nThe term \"nerves,\" and its adjective, \"nervous,\" are used in two totally\r\ndistinct senses: one, that which is vague and unsubstantial, purely\r\nmental or subjective, and, in the realm of disease at least, imaginary;\r\nthe other, purely anatomical, referring to certain strands of tissue\r\ndevoted to the purpose of transmitting impulses, and the condition\r\naffecting these strands. I am not so rash as to raise the question\r\nhere,--still less to attempt to settle it,--which of these two views is\r\nthe right and rational one. Whether the brain secretes thought as the\r\nliver does bile, or whether the mind created the brain and nervous\r\nsystem, or, as it has been epigrammatically put in a recent work on\r\npsychology, \"whether the mind has a body, or the body has a mind,\" I\r\nmerely call attention to the fact that this confusion of meanings\r\nexists, and that its injection into the field of medicine and pathology,\r\nat least, has done an enormous amount of harm in the way of confusing\r\nproblems and preventing a proper recognition of the actual facts.\r\n\r\nThe more carefully and exhaustively and dispassionately we study the\r\ndisorders of the nervous system which come in the field of medicine, the\r\nmore irresistibly we are drawn to the conclusion that from neurasthenia\r\nand hysteria to insanity and paralysis they are every one of them the\r\nresult of some definite morbid change in some cell or strand of the\r\nnervous system. The man or woman who is nervous has poisoned\r\nnerve-cells, either from hereditary defect, or direct saturation of the\r\ntissues with toxic substances. The patient who has an imaginary disease\r\nis suffering from some kind of a hallucination produced by poison-soaked\r\nnerve-cells, such as in highest degree give rise to the delirium of\r\nfevers, and the horrid spectres of delirium tremens.\r\n\r\nEven the man who is suffering from a \"mind diseased,\" and confined in\r\none of our merciful asylums for the insane, is in that condition and\r\nposition on account of physical disease, not merely of his brain, but of\r\nhis entire body. The lunatic is insane, in the for once correct\r\nderivative sense of unhealthy, to the very tips of his fingers. Not\r\nmerely his mind and his brain, but his liver, his stomach, his skin, his\r\nhair and fingernails, the very sweat-glands of his surface which control\r\nhis bodily odor, are diseased and have been so usually for years before\r\nhis mind breaks down.\r\n\r\nTell a competent expert to pick out of a crowd of a thousand men and\r\nwomen the ten who are likely to become insane, and his selection will be\r\nfound almost invariably to include the two or three who will actually\r\nbecome so.\r\n\r\nIn fact, from even the crudest and scantiest knowledge of the actual\r\ngrowth of our own bodies from the ovum to the adult, it will be\r\ndifficult to conceive how this relation could be otherwise, The\r\nnerve-cells and their long processes, which form the nerve-trunks, are\r\nsimply one of a score of different specialized cells which exist side by\r\nside in the body. Primarily all our body-cells had the power of\r\nresponding to stimuli, of digesting and elaborating food, of moving by\r\ncontraction, of reproducing their kind. The nerve-cells are simply a\r\ngroup which have specialized exclusively upon the power of receiving and\r\ntransmitting impulses. They still take food, but it has to be prepared\r\nfor them by the other cells; and here, as we shall see later, is one of\r\nthe dangers to which they are exposed. They still reproduce their kind,\r\nbut in very much smaller and more limited degree. They still, incredible\r\nas it may seem, probably have slight powers of movement or contraction,\r\nand can draw in their processes. But they have surrendered many of their\r\nrights and neglected some of their primitive accomplishments, in order\r\nto devote themselves more exclusively and perfectly to the carrying out\r\nof one or two things.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all this, however, they still remain blood-brothers and\r\ncomrades to every other cell in the body. In the language of Shylock,\r\n\"If you cut them, they will bleed; if you tickle them, they will laugh;\r\nif you starve them, they will die.\" In all this development, which\r\ncontinued up to a late hour last night, and is still going on, the\r\nnerve-tissue has lain side by side with every other tissue in the body,\r\nfed by the same blood, supplied with the same oxygen, saturated with the\r\nsame body-lymph.\r\n\r\nIt is of course perfectly clear that any influence, whether beneficial\r\nor injurious, affecting the body, will also be likely to affect the\r\nnervous system, as a part of it; and this is precisely the fact, as we\r\nfind it. If the body be well fed, well warmed, sufficiently exercised,\r\nwithout being overworked, and allowed a liberal allowance of that\r\nrecharging of the human battery which we call sleep, then the nervous\r\nsystem will work smoothly and easily, at peace with itself and with all\r\nmankind. Its sense-organs will receive external impressions promptly and\r\naccurately. Its conducting fibres will transmit them to the centre with\r\nneither delay nor friction. The brain clearing-house will receive and\r\ndispose of them with ease and good judgment. And then, just because his\r\nnervous system is working to perfection, we say that such an individual\r\n\"has no nerves.\"\r\n\r\nIf the triumph of art be to conceal art, then the nerves have achieved\r\nthis. They have literally effaced themselves in the well-being of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand, the food-supply is inadequate, if the sleep\r\nallowance has been cut short, whether by the demands of work or by those\r\nof fashion, if the body has been starved of oxygen and deprived of\r\nsunlight, if the whole system has been kept on the rack, whether in the\r\nsweatshop, or in the furnace of affliction, what is the effect on the\r\nnervous system? Just what might have been expected. The sense-organs\r\nshy, like a frightened horse, at every shadow or fluttering leaf. The\r\nconducting wires break, and cross, and tangle in every imaginable\r\nfashion. The central exchange, half wild with hunger, or crazed with\r\nfatigue-toxins, shrieks out as each distorted message comes in, or sulks\r\nbecause it can't understand them. And then, with charming logicality, we\r\ndeclare that such an one is \"all nerves.\"\r\n\r\nThe brain, by which we mean the biggest one near the mouth,--we have\r\nlittle brains, or _ganglia_ all over our bodies,--so far from being an\r\nabsolute monarch, is not even a constitutional one, or a president of a\r\nrepublic, but a mere house of congress of the modern type, which can do\r\nlittle but register and obey the demands of its constituents. The brain\r\noriginates nothing. Impulses are brought to it from the sense-organs by\r\nthe nerves. They set up in it certain vibrations, or chemical\r\ndisturbances. It responds to these much as blue litmus paper turns red\r\nwhen a weak acid is dropped on it, or as lemonade fizzes when you put\r\nsoda in it. If more than one of these vibrations are set up\r\nsimultaneously, it \"chooses\" between them, by responding to the\r\nstrongest. If the response differs from the stimulus, it is because of\r\nits huge deference to precedent as established by the records of\r\nprevious stimuli with which its tissues are stored.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to the interesting and important question, What are the\r\ncauses of these disturbances of the nerve-tissues? Probably the most\r\nimportant single result that has been reached in our study of nervous\r\ndiseases in the last fifteen years, is that the cause of them in easily\r\neighty per cent of all cases _lies entirely outside of the nervous\r\nsystem_.\r\n\r\nThe stomach burns, the nerve-tissues send in the fire alarm and order\r\nout the engines. The liver goes on a strike, and the body-garbage, which\r\nit has failed to burn to clean ashes and clear smoke, poisons the\r\nnerve-cells, and they remonstrate accordingly, on behalf of the other\r\ntissues. The heart, or blood-vessels, fails to supply a certain muscle\r\nwith its due rations of blood and the nerves of the region cry out in\r\nthe agony of cramp.\r\n\r\nWe have discovered, by half a century of careful study in the hospital\r\nand in the sick-room, not only that the nerve-tissues are usually\r\npoisoned by defect of other tissues of the body, but that they are among\r\nthe very last of the body-stuffs to succumb to an intoxication. The\r\ncomplications of a given disease involving the nervous system are almost\r\ninvariably the last of all to appear. This is one of the things that has\r\ngiven nervous diseases such a bad name for unmanageableness and\r\nincurableness, and that for years made us regard their study as so\r\nnearly hopeless, so far as any helpful results were concerned.\r\n\r\nWhen a disease has, so to speak, soaked into the inmost core of the\r\nnerve-fibre, it has got a hold which it will take months and even years\r\nto dislodge. And before your remedies can reach it, it will often have\r\ndone irreparable damage. An illustration of the care taken to spare the\r\nnervous system is furnished by its behavior in starvation. If a man or\r\nan animal has almost died of starvation, the tissues of the body will be\r\nfound to have been wasted in very varying degrees, the fat, of course,\r\nmost of all; in fact this will have almost entirely disappeared, all but\r\nthree per cent. Then come the liver and great glands, which will have\r\nshrunk about sixty per cent; then the muscles, thirty per cent; then the\r\nheart and blood-vessels. Last of all, the nervous system, which will\r\nscarcely have wasted to any appreciable degree. In fact, it is an\r\nobvious instance of jettison on the part of the body, throwing overboard\r\nthose tissues which it could most easily spare, and hanging on like grim\r\ndeath to those which were absolutely essential to its continued\r\nexistence, viz., the heart and the nervous system. To use a\r\ncannibalistic and more correct illustration, it is killing and eating\r\nthe less useful and valuable members of its family, in order that their\r\nflesh may keep alive the two or three most indispensable.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration is the actual behavior of the nerve-stuff in\r\ndisease. This is most clearly shown in those clear-cut disturbances\r\nwhich are definitely known to be due to a specific infection; in other\r\nwords, invasion of the body by a disease-organism, or germ.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it may be stated that physicians are now substantially\r\nagreed that two-thirds of the general diseases of the nervous system are\r\ndue to the extension of one of these acute infections to the\r\nnerve-tissue; and this extension almost invariably comes late in the\r\ndisease. The only exceptions to this rule in the whole list of\r\ninfectious diseases are two, epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis (spotted\r\nfever), and tetanus (lockjaw). Both of these have an extraordinary and\r\ndeadly preference for the nervous system from the very start, and this\r\nis what gives them their frightful mortality and discouraging outlook.\r\nEven of this small number of exceptions, we are not altogether certain\r\nas to epidemic meningitis, inasmuch as we do not know how long the germ\r\nmay have existed in the other tissues of the body before it succeeded in\r\nworking its way to and attacking the brain and spinal cord.\r\n\r\nThe case of tetanus, however, is perfectly clear in this regard, and\r\nexceedingly interesting, inasmuch as it explains why a disease specially\r\ninvolving the nervous system from the start is so excessively hard to\r\ncheck or cure. The germ of the disease, long ago identified as one\r\nhaving its habitat in farm or garden soils,--particularly those which\r\nhave been heavily fertilized with horse manure,--gets into the system\r\nthrough a cut or scratch upon the surface, into which the soil is\r\nrubbed. These infected cuts, for obvious reasons, are most frequently\r\nupon the hands or feet.\r\n\r\nSmall doses of the organism have been injected into animals; then, when\r\nthey have recovered, larger ones, and so on, after the manner of the\r\nbacillus of diphtheria, until a powerful antitoxin can be obtained from\r\ntheir blood, very minute quantities of which will promptly kill the\r\nbacilli in a test-tube. For seven or eight years past we have been\r\ninjecting this into every patient with tetanus that came under our\r\nobservation, but so far with very limited benefit, even though the\r\ninjections were made directly into the spinal cord, or brain substance.\r\nThe problem puzzled us for years, until finally Cattani stumbled upon\r\nthe explanation. While we had been supposing that the poison was\r\ncarried, as almost every other known poison is, through the\r\nblood-vessels, or lymph-channels, to the heart and thence to the brain,\r\nhe clearly proved that it ran up the central axis of the nerve-trunks,\r\nand consequently, when it had got once fairly started up this channel,\r\nwas as safe from the attack of any antitoxin merely present in the\r\ngeneral circulation and fluids of the body, as the copper of the\r\nAtlantic cable is from the eroding action of the sea-water. If, in his\r\nexperimental animals, he carefully sought for the cut end of the\r\nnerve-trunk in the wound that had been infected, and injected the\r\nantitoxin directly into that, the disease was stopped. Or it might even\r\nbe \"headed off\" by the crude method of cutting directly across the\r\nnerve-trunk at a point above that yet reached by the infection.\r\n\r\nThe commonest and most fatal of all forms of general diseases of the\r\nnervous system are those which are due to the later extensions of\r\ngeneral infections.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost stands syphilis, due to the invasion of the blood by\r\na clearly defined _spirillum_, the _Treponema pallida_ of Schaudinn.\r\nThis first attacks the mucous membranes of the throat and mouth, then\r\nthe skin, then the great internal organs like the liver and stomach,\r\nthen the bones, and, last of all, the nervous system. The length of time\r\nwhich the poison takes to reach the nervous system is something which at\r\nfirst sight is almost incredible, viz., from one and a half to fifteen\r\nyears. It is true that in rare instances brain symptoms will manifest\r\nthemselves within six or eight months; but these are usually due to\r\npressure by inflammatory growths on the bones of the skull and its\r\nlining membrane (_dura mater_). It is not too much to say that this\r\ndisease plays the greatest single rôle in nervous pathology. Three of\r\nthe commonest and most fatal diseases of the spinal cord and brain,\r\n_paresis_ (general paralysis of the insane), _locomotor ataxia_, and\r\n_lateral sclerosis_, are due to it.\r\n\r\nNaturally, when a poison has taken a decade or a decade and a half to\r\npenetrate to the nerve-tissues, it does irreparable damage long before\r\nit can be dislodged or neutralized.\r\n\r\nA similar aftermath may occur in almost all of the acute infectious\r\ndiseases. Every year adds a new one to the list capable of causing\r\ncerebral complications. Tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever,\r\ntyphoid, smallpox, influenza, have now well-recognized cerebral and\r\nnervous complications, some temporary, some permanent. A form of\r\ntuberculosis attacking the coverings (_meninges_) of the brain--hence\r\nknown as meningitis--is far the commonest fatal brain-disease of\r\ninfancy and childhood.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking illustration of just how acute affections\r\nattack the nervous system, is that furnished by diphtheria. A child\r\ndevelops an attack of this disease, passes the crisis safely, and begins\r\nto recover. A few days later, it is allowed to sit up in bed. Suddenly,\r\nafter some slight exertion, or often without any apparent cause, the\r\nface blanches, the eyes stare widely, the child gasps two or three\r\ntimes, and is dead: sudden heart failure, due to the poisoning either of\r\nthe heart muscle itself, or of the nerves supplying the heart, by the\r\ntoxin of the disease. Moral: Keep diphtheria patients strictly at rest\r\nin bed for at least a week after the crisis is past. Another case will\r\npass this period safely, though perhaps with a rapid and weak heart, for\r\ndays or weeks; then one morning the child will choke when swallowing\r\nmilk. The next time it is attempted, the milk, instead of going down the\r\nthroat, comes back through the nostrils. Paralysis of the soft palate\r\nhas developed, apparently from a local saturation of the nerves with the\r\npoison. This may go no further, or it may extend, as it commonly does,\r\nto the nerves of the eye, and the child squints and can no longer read,\r\nif old enough, because the muscle of accommodation also is paralyzed.\r\nThe arms and limbs may be affected, and in extreme cases the nerves of\r\nrespiration supplying the diaphragm may be involved, and the child dies\r\nof suffocation. In the majority of cases, however, fortunately, after\r\nthis paralysis has lasted from three to six weeks, it gradually\r\nsubsides, and may clear up completely, though not at all infrequently\r\none or more muscles may remain permanently damaged by the attack,\r\ngiving, for instance, a palatal tone to the voice, or interfering with\r\nthe production of singing tones. Occasionally a permanent squint may\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIt might be said in passing, that, with one of the charming logicalities\r\nof popular reasoning, these nerve complications have been said to be\r\n_caused by_ antitoxin, simply because the use of the antitoxin saves\r\nmore children alive to develop them.\r\n\r\nThe next group of nervous diseases may be roughly described as due to\r\nthe failure of some part of the digestive system, like the stomach and\r\nintestines, properly to elaborate its food; or of one of the great\r\nglands, like the liver, thyroid, or suprarenal, properly to supply its\r\nsecretion, which is needed to neutralize the poisons normally produced\r\nin the body. This class is very large and very important. It has long\r\nbeen known how surely a disordered liver \"predicts damnation\";\r\nmelancholia, or \"black bilious condition,\" hypochondria, or \"under the\r\nrib-cartilages\" (where the liver lies), are every-day figures of speech.\r\nA thorough house-cleaning of the alimentary canal, together with proper\r\nstimulation of the skin and kidneys, and an intelligent regulation of\r\ndiet, are our most important measures in the treatment of diseases of\r\nthe nervous system, even in those extreme forms known as insanity.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to these are those disturbances of the nervous system\r\nlumped together under the soul-satisfying designation of \"neurasthenia,\"\r\nwhich are chiefly due to the accumulation in the system of the fatigue\r\npoisons, or substances due to prolonged overstrain, under-rest, or\r\nunderfeeding of the system. Neurasthenia is the \"fatigue neurosis,\" as a\r\nleading expert terms it. It may be due to any morbid condition under\r\nheaven. It is \"that blessed word Mesopotamia\" of the slipshod\r\ndiagnostician. Nearly one-fourth of the cases which come into our\r\nsanatoria for tuberculosis have been diagnosed and treated for months\r\nand even years as \"neurasthenia.\" It satisfies the patient--and it means\r\nnothing; though some experts contend for a distinct disease entity of\r\nthis name but admit its rarity.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent neurologist, nowadays, has practically no known specific\r\nfor any form of nervous disease, no remedy which acts directly and\r\ncuratively upon the nervous system itself. He relies chiefly--and this\r\napplies to the asylum physician also--upon intestinal antisepsis, upon\r\nrest, upon baths, upon regulation diet, and habits of life.\r\n\r\nA number of the more sudden and fatal disturbances of the nervous\r\nsystem, as for instance, the familiar \"stroke of paralysis,\" or\r\napoplexy, of later middle life, are due to a defect, not in the nervous\r\nsystem at all, but in the blood-vessels supplying the brain; rupture of\r\na vessel, and consequent escape of blood, destroys so much of the\r\nsurrounding brain-tissue as to produce paralysis, and, in extreme cases,\r\ndeath. Just why the blood-vessels of the brain in general, and of one\r\npart of the basal ganglia in particular (the _Lenticulostriate_ artery\r\nin the internal capsule of the _corpus striatum_, the old jaw\r\nganglion), are so liable to rupture we do not know; but it certainly is\r\nchiefly from a defect of the blood-vessels, and not of the brain. All of\r\nwhich brings us to the following important practical conclusions.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, that every attack or touch, however light, of\r\n\"nervousness,\" \"nerves,\" \"imagination,\" \"neurasthenia,\" yes, hysteria,\r\n_means_ something. It is the cry of protest of a smaller or larger part\r\nof the nervous system against underfed blood, under-ventilated muscles,\r\nlack of sunlight, lack of exercise, lack of sleep, excess of work, or\r\nbad habits. In other words, it is the danger signal, the red light\r\nshowing the open switch, and we will disregard it at our peril.\r\nUnfortunately, by that power of _esprit de corps_ of the entire system,\r\nknown as \"pluck\" or \"grit,\" or the veto-power, physiologically termed\r\ninhibition, we may ignore and for a time suppress the symptom, but this\r\nin the long run is just as rational as cutting the wire that rings a\r\nfire alarm, or blowing out the red light without closing the switch.\r\n\r\nNervousness is a _symptom_ which should always have _something done for\r\nit_, especially in children. In fact, it has passed into an axiom both\r\nwith intelligent teachers and with physicians who have much to do with\r\nthe little ones, that crossness, fretfulness, laziness, lack of\r\ninitiative, and readiness to weep, in children, are almost invariably\r\nthe signs of physical disease. And this doctrine will apply to a\r\nconsiderable percentage of children of larger growth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of the first and most decided tendencies on the part\r\nof the badly fed or poisoned nervous system, is to exaggerate the\r\ndifficulties of the situation, and to minimize its good features. The\r\nindividual \"has lost his nerve,\" is afraid to undertake things, shrinks\r\nfrom responsibility, exaggerates the difficulties that may be in the\r\nway; hence the floods of tears, or outbursts of temper, with which\r\nnervous children will greet the suggestion of any task or duty, however\r\ntrifling. If the nervous individual has reached that stage of maturity\r\nwhen she realizes that she is not merely \"naughty,\" but sick, then this\r\nsame process applies itself to her disease. She is sure that she is\r\ngoing to die, that another attack like that will end in paralysis; as a\r\npatient of mine once expressed it to me, \"My heart jumps up in my mouth,\r\nI bite a couple of pieces off it, and it falls back again.\" In short,\r\nshe so obviously and grossly exaggerates every symptom and phase of her\r\ndisease, that the impression irresistibly arises that the disease itself\r\nis a fabrication. This view of her condition by her family or her\r\nphysician is the tragedy of the neurasthenic.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, _no_ disease, even of the nervous system, is ever\r\npurely imaginary. Some part of the patient's nervous system is poisoned,\r\nor he would not imagine himself to be sick. We can all of us find\r\ntrouble enough in some part of our complex bodily machinery, if we go\r\naround hunting for it; but this is precisely what the healthy man, or\r\nwoman, _never_ does. They have other things to occupy them, and are far\r\nmore liable to run into danger by pushing ahead at full steam, and\r\nneglecting small creakings and jarrings until something important in the\r\ngear jams, or goes snap, and brings them to a halt, than they are to be\r\nwasting time and energy worrying over things that may never happen.\r\n\r\nWorry, in fact, is a sign of disease instead of a cause. To put it very\r\ncrudely, whenever the blood and fluids of a body become impoverished\r\nbelow a certain degree, or become loaded with fatigue poisons, or other\r\nwaste products above a certain point, then the nervous system proceeds\r\nto make itself felt. Either the perceptive end-organs become color-blind\r\nand read yellow for blue, or are astigmatic and report oval for round;\r\nor the conducting nerve-strands tangle up the messages, or deliver them\r\nto the wrong centre; or the central clearing-house, puzzled by the\r\ncrooked messages, loses its head, and begins to throw the inkstands\r\nabout, or goes down in a sulk. In other words, the nervous system goes\r\non a strike. But it is perfectly idle to endeavor to treat it with\r\ncheering words, or kindly meant falsehoods, to the effect that \"nothing\r\nis really the matter.\" Like any other strike, it can be rationally dealt\r\nwith only by improving the conditions under which the operatives have to\r\nwork, and meeting their demands for higher wages, or shorter hours.\r\n\r\nWe were accustomed at one time to divide diseases into two great\r\nclasses, organic and functional. By the former, we meant those in which\r\nthere was some positive defect of structure, which could be recognized\r\nby the eye or the microscope; by the latter, those diseases in which\r\nthis could not be discovered, in which, so to speak, the machine was all\r\nright, but simply wouldn't work. It goes without saying that the latter\r\nclass was simply a confession of our ignorance, and one which is\r\nsteadily and rapidly diminishing as science progresses.\r\n\r\nIf the machine won't work, there is a reason for it somewhere, and our\r\nbusiness is to find it out, and not loftily to assure our patients that\r\nthere is nothing much the matter, and all they need is rest, or a little\r\ncheerful occupation. Furthermore, the most inane thing that a\r\nsympathizing friend or kindly physician can do to a neurasthenic, is to\r\nadvise him to take his mind off himself or his symptoms. The utter\r\ninability to do that very thing is one of the chief symptoms of the\r\ndisease, which will not disappear until the underlying cause has been\r\ncarefully studied out and removed.\r\n\r\n\"Nerves,\" \"neurasthenia,\" \"psychasthenia,\" and \"hysteria,\" are all the\r\nnames of _symptoms_ of _definite bodily disease_. The modern physician\r\nregards it as his duty to study out and discover the nature of this\r\ndisease, and, if possible, remove it, rather than to give high-sounding,\r\nsoul-satisfying names to the symptoms, and advise the patient to \"cheer\r\nup\"; which advice costs nothing--and is worth just what it costs.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" some one will say at once, \"if nervous diseases are simply the\r\nreflection of general bodily states, as sanitary conditions improve\r\nunder civilization, should they not become less frequent? And yet, any\r\nnewspaper will tell you that nervous diseases are rapidly on the\r\nincrease.\" This is a widespread belief, not only on the part of the\r\npublic, but of many scientists and a considerable number of physicians;\r\nbut it is, I believe, unfounded.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we have no reliable statistical basis for a positive\r\nstatement, either one way or another. Our ignorance of the precise\r\nprevalence of disease in savagery, in barbarism, and even under\r\ncivilization up to fifty years ago, is absolute and profound. It is only\r\nsince 1840 that vital statistics of any value, except as to gross deaths\r\nand births, began to be kept. So far as we are able to judge from our\r\nstudy of savage tribes by the explorer, the army surgeon, and the\r\nmedical missionary, the savage nervous system is far less well balanced\r\nand adjustable than that of civilized man. Hysteria, instead of\r\noccurring only in individual instances, attacks whole villages and\r\ntribes. In fact, the average savage lives in a state alternating between\r\nnaïve and childish self-satisfaction and panic-stricken terror, with\r\ntheir resultant cowardice and cruelty on the one hand, and unbridled\r\nlust and delusions of grandeur on the other. The much-vaunted strain of\r\ncivilization upon the nervous system is not one-fifth that of savagery.\r\n\r\nThink of living in a state when any night might see your village raided,\r\nyour hut burned, yourself killed or tortured at the stake, and your wife\r\nand children carried into slavery. Read the old hymns and see how\r\ndevoutly thankful our pious ancestors _were every day_ at finding\r\nthemselves alive in the morning,--\"Safely through another night,\"--and\r\nfancy the nerve-strain of never knowing, when you lay down to sleep,\r\nwhether some one of the djinns, or voodoos, or vampires would swoop down\r\nupon you before morning. Think of facing death by famine every winter,\r\nby drought or cyclone every summer, and by open war or secret\r\nscalp-raid every month in the year; and then say that the racking\r\nnerve-strain of the commuter's time-table, the deadly clash of the\r\nwheat-pit, or the rasping grind of office-hours, would be ruinous to the\r\nuncivilized nervous system. Certainly, in those belated savages, the\r\ndwellers in our slums, hysteria, diseases of the imagination, enjoyment\r\nof ill health, and the whole brood of functional nervous disturbances\r\nare just as common as they are on Fifth Avenue.\r\n\r\nIt is not even certain that insanity is increasing. Insanity is quite\r\ncommon among savages; just how common is difficult to say, on account of\r\ntheir peculiar methods of treating it. The stupid and the dangerous\r\nforms are very apt to be simply knocked on the head, while the more\r\nharmless and fantastic varieties are turned into priests and prophets\r\nand become the founders of the earlier religions. A somewhat similar\r\nstate of affairs of course prevailed among civilized races up to within\r\nthe last three-quarters of a century. The idiot and the harmless lunatic\r\nwere permitted to run at large, and the latter, as court and village\r\nfools, furnished no small part of popular entertainment, since organized\r\ninto vaudeville. Only the dangerous or violent maniacs were actually\r\nshut up; consequently, the number of insane in a community a century ago\r\nrefers solely to this class. Hence, in every country where statistics\r\nhave been kept, as larger and larger percentages of these unfortunates\r\nhave been gathered into hospitals, where they can be kindly cared for\r\nand intelligently treated, the number of the registered insane has\r\nsteadily increased up to a certain point. This was reached some fifteen\r\nyears ago in Great Britain, in Germany, in Sweden, and in other\r\ncountries which have taken the lead in asylum reform, and has remained\r\npractically stationary since, at the comparatively low rate of from two\r\nto three per thousand living. This limit shows signs of having been\r\nreached in the United States already; and this gradual increase of\r\nrecognition and registration is the only basis for the alleged increase\r\nof insanity under modern conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is also a significant fact that the lower and less favorably situated\r\nstratum of our population furnishes not only the largest number of\r\ninmates, but the largest percentage of insanity in proportion to their\r\nnumbers, while the most highly educated and highly civilized classes\r\nfurnish the lowest. Immigrants furnish nearly three times as many\r\ninmates per thousand to our American asylums as the native born.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, true that in each succeeding census a steadily\r\nincreasing number and percentage of the deaths is attributed to diseases\r\nof the nervous system. This, however, does not yet exceed fifteen or\r\ntwenty per cent of the whole, which would be, so to speak, the natural\r\nprobable percentage of deaths due to failure of one of the five great\r\nsystems of the body: the digestive, the respiratory, the circulatory,\r\nthe glandular, the nervous. Two elements may certainly be counted upon\r\nas contributing in very large degree to this apparent increase. One is\r\nthe enormous saving of life which has been accomplished by sanitation\r\nand medical progress during the first five years of life, infant\r\nmortality having been reduced in many instances fifty to sixty per\r\ncent, thus of course leaving a larger number of individuals to die later\r\nin life by the diseases especially of the blood-vessels, kidneys, and\r\nnervous system, which are most apt to occur after middle life. The other\r\nis the great increase in medical knowledge, resulting in the more\r\naccurate discovery of the causes of death, and a more correct reporting\r\nand classifying of the same.\r\n\r\nIn short, a careful review of all the facts available to date leads us\r\ndecidedly to the conclusion that the nervous system is the toughest and\r\nmost resisting tissue of the body, and that its highest function, the\r\nmind, has the greatest stability of any of our bodily powers. Only one\r\nman in six dies of disease of the nervous system, as contrasted with\r\nnearly one in three from diseases of the lungs; and only one individual\r\nin four hundred becomes insane, as contrasted with from three to ten\r\ntimes that number whose digestive systems, whose locomotor apparatus,\r\nwhose heart and blood-vessels become hopelessly deranged without\r\nactually killing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nMENTAL INFLUENCE IN DISEASE, OR HOW THE MIND AFFECTS THE BODY\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the dearest delusions of man through all the ages has been that\r\nhis body is under the control of his mind. Even if he didn't quite\r\nbelieve it in his heart of hearts, he has always wanted to. The reason\r\nis obvious. The one thing that he felt absolutely sure he could control\r\nwas his own mind. If he couldn't control that, what could he control?\r\nErgo, if man could control his mind and his mind could control his body,\r\nman is master of his fate. Unfortunately, almost in proportion as he\r\nbecomes confident of one link in the chain he becomes doubtful of the\r\nother. Nowadays he has quite as many qualms of uncertainty as to whether\r\nhe can control his mind as about the power of his mind over his body. By\r\na strange paradox we are discovering that our most genuine and lasting\r\ncontrol over our minds is to be obtained by modifying the conditions of\r\nour bodies, while the field in which we modify bodily conditions by\r\nmental influence is steadily shrinking.\r\n\r\nFor centuries we punished the sick in mind, the insane, loading them\r\nwith chains, shutting them up in prison-cells, starving, yes, even\r\nflogging them. We exorcised their demons, we prayed over them, we argued\r\nwith them,--without the record of a single cure. Now we treat their\r\nsick and ailing bodies just as we would any other class of chronic\r\npatients, with rest, comfortable surroundings, good food, baths, and\r\nfresh air, correction of bad habits, gentleness, and kindness, leaving\r\ntheir minds and souls practically without treatment, excepting in so far\r\nas ordinary, decent humanity and consideration may be regarded as mental\r\nremedies,--and we cure from thirty to fifty per cent, and make all but\r\nfive per cent comfortable, contented, comparatively happy.\r\n\r\nWe are still treating the inebriate, the habitual drunkard, as a minor\r\ncriminal, by mental and moral means--with what hopeful results let the\r\ndisgraceful records of our police courts testify. We are now treating\r\ntruancy by the removal of adenoids and the fitting of glasses; juvenile\r\ncrime by the establishment of playgrounds; poverty and pauperism by\r\ngood food, living wages, and decent surroundings; and all for the first\r\ntime with success.\r\n\r\nIn short, not only have all our substantial and permanent victories over\r\nbodily ills been won by physical means, but a large majority of our\r\nsuccesses in mental and moral diseases as well. Yet the obsession\r\npersists, and we long to extend the realm of mental treatment in bodily\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThat the mind does exert an influence over the body, and a powerful one,\r\nin both health and disease, is obvious. But what we are apt to forget is\r\nthat the whole history of the progress of medicine has been a record of\r\ndiminishing resort to this power as a means of cure. The measure of our\r\nsuccess and of our control over disease has been, and is yet, in exact\r\nproportion to the extent to which we can relegate this resource to the\r\nbackground and avoid resorting to it. Instead of mental influence being\r\nthe newest method of treatment it is the oldest. Two-thirds of the\r\nmethods of the shaman, the witch-doctor, the medicine-man, were psychic.\r\nInstead of being an untried remedy, it is the most thoroughly tested,\r\nmost universal, most ubiquitous remedy listed anywhere upon the pages of\r\nhistory, and, it may be frankly stated, in civilized countries, as\r\nwidely discredited as tested. The proportion to which it survives in the\r\nmedicine of any race is the measure of that race's barbarism and\r\nbackwardness. To-day two of the most significant criteria of the measure\r\nof enlightenment and of control over disease of either the medical\r\nprofession of a nation or of an individual physician are the extent to\r\nwhich they resort to and rely upon mental influence and opium.\r\nPsychotherapy and narcotics are, and ever have been, the sheet-anchors\r\nof the charlatan and the miracle-worker.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the medical profession toward mental influence in the\r\ntreatment of disease is neither friendly nor hostile. It simply regards\r\nit as it would any other remedial agency, a given drug, for instance, a\r\nbath, or a form of electricity or light. It is opposed to it, if at all,\r\nonly in so far as it has tested it and found it inferior to other\r\nremedies. Its distrust of it, so far as this exists, is simply the\r\nfeeling that it has toward half a hundred ancient drugs and remedial\r\nagencies which it has dropped from its list of working remedies as\r\nobsolete, many of which still survive in household and folk medicine. My\r\npurpose is neither to champion it nor to discredit it, and least of all\r\nto antagonize or throw doubt upon any of the systems of philosophy or of\r\nreligion with which it has been frequently associated, but merely to\r\nattempt to present a brief outline of its advantages, its character, and\r\nits limitations, exactly as one might of, say, calomel, quinine, or\r\nbelladonna.\r\n\r\nAs in the study of a drug, the chief points to be considered are: What\r\nare its actual powers? What effects can be produced with it, both in\r\nhealth and sickness? What are the diseases in which such effects may be\r\nuseful, and how frequent are they? In what way does it produce its\r\neffects, directly or indirectly?\r\n\r\nThe first and most striking claim that is made for mental influence in\r\ndisease is based upon the allegation that it has the power of producing\r\ndisease and even death; the presumption, of course, being that, if able\r\nto produce these conditions, it would certainly have some influence in\r\nremoving or preventing them. Upon this point the average man is\r\nsurprisingly positive and confident in his convictions. Popular\r\nliterature and legend are full of historic instances where individuals\r\nhave not merely been made seriously ill but have even been killed by\r\npowerful impressions upon their imaginations. Most men are ready to\r\nrelate to you instances that have been directly reported to them of\r\npersons who were literally frightened to death. But the moment that we\r\ncome to investigate these widely quoted and universally accepted\r\ninstances, we find ourselves in a curious position. On the one hand,\r\nmerely a series of vague tales and stories, without date, locality,\r\nname, or any earmark by which they can be identified or tested. On the\r\nother, a collection of rare and extraordinary instances of sudden death\r\nwhich have happened to be preceded by a powerful mental impression, many\r\nof which bear clearly upon their face the imprint of death by rupture of\r\na blood-vessel, heart failure, or paralysis, in the course of some\r\nwell-marked and clearly defined chronic disease, like valvular\r\nheart-mischief, diabetes, or Bright's disease.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation most of these cases which have been seen by a\r\nphysician previous to death have been recognized as subject to a disease\r\nlikely to terminate in sudden death; and practically all in which a\r\npost-mortem examination has been made have shown a definite physical\r\ncause of death. The fright, anger, or other mental impression, was\r\nmerely the last straw, which, throwing a sudden strain upon already\r\nweakened vessels, heart, or brain, precipitated the final catastrophe.\r\nIn some cases, even the sense of fright and the premonition of\r\napproaching death were merely the first symptoms of impending\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nThe stories of death from purely imaginative impressions, such as the\r\nvictims being told that they were seriously ill, that they would die on\r\nor about such and such a date, fall into two great classes. The first of\r\nthese--involving death at a definite date, after it had been prophesied\r\neither by the victim or some physician or priest--may be dismissed in a\r\nfew words, as they lead at once into the realm of prophecy, witchcraft,\r\nand voodoo. Most of them are little better than after-echoes of the\r\nethnic stories of the \"evil eye,\" and of bewitched individuals fading\r\naway and dying after their wax image has been stuck full of pins or\r\notherwise mutilated. There have occurred instances of individuals dying\r\nupon the date at which some one in whose powers of prophecy they had\r\nconfidence declared they would, or even upon a date on which they had\r\nsettled in their own minds, and announced accordingly; but these are so\r\nrare as readily to come within the percentage probabilities of pure\r\ncoincidence. Most such prophecies fail utterly; but the failures are not\r\nrecorded, only the chance successes.\r\n\r\nThe second group of these alleged instances of death by mental\r\nimpression is in most singular case. Practically every one with whom you\r\nconverse, every popular volume of curiosities which you pick up, is\r\nready to relate one or more instances of such an event. But the more you\r\nlisten to these relations, the more familiar do they become, until\r\nfinally they practically simmer down to two stock legends, which we have\r\nall heard related in some form.\r\n\r\nFirst, and most famous, is the story of a vigorous, healthy man accosted\r\nby a series of doctors at successive corners of the street down which he\r\nis walking, with the greeting:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, my dear Mr. So-and-So, what is the matter? How ill you look!\"\r\n\r\nHe becomes alarmed, takes to his bed, falls into a state of collapse,\r\nand dies within a few days.\r\n\r\nThe other story is even more familiar and dramatic. Again it is a group\r\nof morbidly curious and spiteful doctors who desire to see whether a\r\nhuman being can be killed by the power of his imagination. A condemned\r\ncriminal is accordingly turned over to them. He is first allowed to see\r\na dog bled to death, one of the physicians holding a watch and timing\r\nthe process with, \"Now he is growing weaker! Now his heart is failing!\r\nNow he dies!\" Then, after having been informed that he is to be bled to\r\ndeath instead of guillotined, his eyes are bandaged and a small,\r\ninsignificant vein in his arm is opened. A basin is held beneath his\r\narm, into which is allowed to drip and gurgle water from a tube so as to\r\nimitate the sounds made by the departing life-blood. Again the\r\ndeath-watch is set and the stages of his decline are called off: \"Now he\r\nweakens! Now his heart is failing!\" until finally, with the solemn\r\npronouncement, \"Now he dies!\" he falls over, gasps a few times and is\r\ndead, though the total amount of blood lost by him does not exceed a few\r\nteaspoonfuls.\r\n\r\nA variant of the story is that the trick was played for pure mischief in\r\nthe initiation ceremonies of some lodge or college fraternity, with the\r\nhorrifying result that death promptly resulted.\r\n\r\nThe stories seem to be little more than pure creatures of the same force\r\nwhose power they are supposed to illustrate, amusing and dramatic\r\nfairy-tales, handed down from generation to generation from Heaven knows\r\nwhat antiquity. Death under such circumstances as these _may_ have\r\noccurred, but the proofs are totally lacking. One of our leading\r\nneurologists, who had extensively experimented in hypnotism and\r\nsuggestion, declared a short time ago: \"I don't believe that death was\r\never caused solely by the imagination.\"\r\n\r\nNow as to the scope of this remedy, the extent of the field in which it\r\ncan reasonably be expected to prove useful. This discussion is, of\r\ncourse, from a purely physical point of view. But it is, I think, now\r\ngenerally admitted, even by most believers in mental healing, that it is\r\nonly, at best, in rarest instances that mental influence can be relied\r\nupon to cure organic disease, namely, disease attended by actual\r\ndestruction of tissue or loss of organs, limbs, or other portions of the\r\nbody. This limits its field of probable usefulness to the so-called\r\n\"functional diseases,\" in which--to put it crudely--the body-machine is\r\nin apparently perfect or nearly perfect condition, but will not work;\r\nand particularly that group of functional diseases which is believed to\r\nbe due largely to the influence of the imagination.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the curious exaggeration and over-estimation of the real\r\nstate of affairs in this field be better illustrated than in the popular\r\nimpression as to the frequency in actual practice of \"imaginary\"\r\ndiseases. Take the incidental testimony of literature, for instance,\r\nwhich is supposed to hold the mirror up to nature, to be a transcript of\r\nlife. The pages of the novel are full, the scenes of the drama are\r\ncrowded with imaginary invalids. Not merely are they one of the most\r\nvaluable stock properties for the humorist, but whole stories and\r\ncomedies have been devoted to their exploitation, like Molière's classic\r\n\"Le Malade Imaginaire,\" and \"Le Médecin Malgré Lui.\" Generation after\r\ngeneration has shaken its sides until they ached over these pompous old\r\nhypochondriacs and fussy old dowagers, whose one amusement in life is to\r\nenjoy ill health and discuss their symptoms. They are as indispensable\r\nmembers of the _dramatis personæ_ of the stock company of fiction as the\r\nwealthy uncle, the crusty old bachelor, and the unprotected orphan. Even\r\nwhere they are only referred to incidentally in the course of the story,\r\nyou are given to understand that they and their kind furnish the\r\nprincipal source of income for the doctor; that if he hasn't the tact to\r\nhumor or the skilled duplicity to plunder and humbug these self-made\r\nsufferers, he might as well retire from practice. In short, the entire\r\natmosphere of the drama gives the strong impression that if\r\npeople--particularly the wealthy classes--would shake themselves and go\r\nabout their business, two-thirds of the illness in the world would\r\ndisappear at once.\r\n\r\nMuch of this may, of course, be accounted for by the delicious and\r\nirresistible attractiveness, for literary purposes, of this type of\r\ninvalid. Genuine, serious illness, inseparable from suffering and ending\r\nin death, is neither a cheerful, an interesting, nor a dramatic episode,\r\nexcept in very small doses, like a well-staged death-bed or a stroke of\r\napoplexy, and does not furnish much valuable material for the novelist\r\nor the play-writer. Battle, murder, and sudden death, while horrible\r\nand repulsive, can be contemplated with vivid, gruesome interest, and\r\nhence are perfectly available as interest producers. But much as we\r\ndelight to talk about our symptoms, we are never particularly interested\r\nin listening to those of others, still less in seeing them portrayed\r\nupon the stage. On account of their slow course, utter absence of\r\npicturesqueness, and depressing character, the vast majority of diseases\r\nare quite unsuitable for artistic material. In fact, the literary worker\r\nis almost limited to a mere handful, at one extreme, which will produce\r\nsudden and dramatic effects, like heart failure, apoplexy, or the\r\nghastly introduction of a \"slow decline\" for a particularly pathetic\r\neffect; and at the other extreme, those imaginary diseases, migraines\r\nand vapors, which furnish amusement by their sheer absurdity.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, such dramatic and literary tendencies have produced\r\ntheir effect, and the popular impression of the doctor is that of a man\r\nwho spends his time between rushing at breakneck speed to save the lives\r\nof those who suddenly find themselves _in articulo mortis_ and will\r\nperish unless he gets there within fifteen minutes, and dancing\r\nattendance upon a swarm of old hypochondriacs, neurotics, and nervous\r\ndyspeptics, of both sexes. As a matter of fact, these two supposed\r\nprincipal occupations of the doctor are the smallest and rarest elements\r\nin his experience.\r\n\r\nA few years ago a writer of world-wide fame deliberately stated, in the\r\ncourse of a carefully considered and critical discussion of various\r\nforms of mental healing, that it was no wonder that these methods\r\nexcited huge interest and wide attention in the community, because, if\r\nvalid, they would have such an enormous field of usefulness, seeing that\r\nat least seven-tenths of all the suffering which presented itself for\r\nrelief to the doctor was imaginary.\r\n\r\nThis, perhaps, is an extreme case, but is not far from representing the\r\ngeneral impression. If a poll were to be taken of five hundred\r\nintelligent men and women selected at random, as to how much of the\r\nsufferings of all invalids, or sick people who are not actually\r\nobviously \"sick unto death\" or ill of a fever, was real and how much\r\nimaginary, the estimate would come pretty close to an equal division.\r\nBut when one comes to try to get at the actual facts, an astonishingly\r\ndifferent state of affairs is revealed. I frankly confess that my own\r\nawakening was a matter of comparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine was offered a position as consulting physician to a\r\nlarge and fashionable sanatorium. He hesitated because he was afraid\r\nthat much of his time would be wasted in listening to the imaginary\r\npains, and soothing the baseless terrors, of wealthy and fashionable\r\ninvalids, who had nothing the matter with them except--in the language\r\nof the resort--\"nervous prosperity.\" His experience was a surprise. At\r\nthe end of two years he told me that he had had under his care between\r\nsix and seven hundred invalids, a large percentage of whom were drawn\r\nfrom the wealthier classes; and out of this number there were _only\r\nfive_ whose sufferings were chiefly attributable to their imagination.\r\nMany of them, of course, had comparatively trivial ailments, and others\r\nexaggerated the degree or mistook the cause of their sufferings; but the\r\nvast majority of them were, as he naïvely expressed it, \"really sick\r\nenough to be interesting.\"\r\n\r\nThis set me to thinking, and I began by making a list of all the\r\n\"imaginary invalids\" I had personally known, and to my astonishment\r\nraked up, from over twenty years' medical experience, barely a baker's\r\ndozen. Inquiries among my colleagues resulted in a surprisingly similar\r\nstate of affairs. While most of them were under the general impression\r\nthat at least ten to twenty per cent of the illnesses presenting\r\nthemselves were without substantial physical basis and largely imaginary\r\nin character, when they came actually to cudgel their memories for\r\nwell-marked cases and to consult their records, they discovered that\r\ntheir memories had been playing the same sort of tricks with them that\r\nthe dramatists and novelists had with popular impressions.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few months one of the leading neurologists of New York,\r\na man whose practice is confined exclusively to mental and nervous\r\ndiseases, stated in a public address that purely or even chiefly\r\nimaginary diseases were among the rarer conditions that the physician\r\nwas called upon to treat. Shortly after, two of the leading neurologists\r\nof Philadelphia, one of them a man of international reputation,\r\npractically repeated this statement; and they put themselves on record\r\nto the effect that the vast majority of those who imagined themselves to\r\nbe ill were ill, though often not to the degree or in precisely the\r\nmanner that they imagined themselves to be.\r\n\r\nObviously, then, this possible realm of suffering in which the mind can\r\noperate is very much more limited than was at one time believed. In\r\nfact, imaginary diseases might be swept out of existence, and humanity\r\nwould scarcely know the difference, so little would the total sum of its\r\nsuffering be reduced.\r\n\r\nAnother field in which there has been much general misunderstanding and\r\nlooseness of both thought and statement, which has again led to\r\nexaggerated ideas of the direct influence of the mind over the body, is\r\nthe well-known effect of emotional states, such as fright or anger, upon\r\nthe ordinary processes of the body. Instances of this relation are, of\r\ncourse, household words,--the man whose \"hair turned white in a single\r\nnight\" from grief or terror; the nursing mother who flew into a furious\r\nfit of passion and whose child was promptly seized with convulsions and\r\ndied the next time it was put to the breast; the father who is\r\nprostrated by the death or disgrace of a favorite son, and dies within a\r\nfew weeks of a broken heart. The first thing that is revealed by even a\r\nbrief study of this subject is that these instances are exceedingly\r\nrare, and owe their familiarity in our minds to their striking and\r\ndramatic character and the excellent \"material\" which they make for the\r\ndramatist and the gossip. It is even difficult to secure clear and valid\r\nproof of the actual occurrence of that sudden blanching of the hair,\r\nwhich has in the minds of most of us been accepted from our earliest\r\nrecollection.\r\n\r\nMore fundamental, however, and vital, is the extent to which we have\r\noverlooked the precise method in which these violent emotional\r\nimpressions alter bodily activities, like the secretions. Granting, for\r\nthe sake of argument, that states of mind, especially of great tension,\r\nhave some direct and mysterious influence as such, and through means\r\nwhich defy physical recognition and study, it must be remembered that\r\nthey have a perfectly definite physiological sphere of influence upon\r\nvital activities. Indeed, we are already in a position to explain at\r\nleast two-thirds of these so-called \"mental influences\" upon purely\r\nphysical and physiological grounds.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, we must remember that these emotions which we are pleased\r\nto term \"states of mind\" are also states of body. If any man were to\r\nstand up before you, for instance, either upon the stage or in private,\r\nand inform you that he was \"scared within an inch of his life,\" without\r\ntremor in his voice, or paling of his countenance, or widening eyes, or\r\ntwitching muscles, or preparations either to escape or to fight, you\r\nwould simply laugh at him. You would readily conclude, either that he\r\nwas making fun of you and felt no such emotion, or that he was\r\nrepressing it by an act of miraculous self-control. The man who is\r\nfrightened and doesn't do anything or look as if he were going to do\r\nanything, the man who is angry and makes no movement or even twitching\r\nsuggesting that fact, is neither angry nor frightened.\r\n\r\nAn emotional state is, of course, a peculiarly complex affair. First,\r\nthere is the reception of the sensation, sight, sound, touch, or smell,\r\nwhich terrifies. This terror is a secondary reaction, and in ninety-nine\r\ncases out of a hundred is conditioned upon our memory of previous\r\nsimilar objects and their dangerousness, or our recollection of what we\r\nhave been told about their deadliness. Then instantly, irrepressibly,\r\ncomes the lightning-flash of horror to our heart, to our muscles, to\r\nour lungs, to get ready to meet this emergency. Then, and not till then,\r\ndo we really feel the emotion. In fact, our most pragmatic philosopher,\r\nWilliam James, has gone so far as to declare that emotions are the\r\nafter-echoes of muscular contractions. By the time an emotion has fairly\r\ngot us in its grip so that we are really conscious of it, the\r\nblood-supply of half the organs in our body has been powerfully altered,\r\nand often completely reversed.\r\n\r\nTo what extent muscular contractions condition emotions, as Professor\r\nJames has suggested, may be easily tested by a quaint and simple little\r\nexperiment upon a group of the smallest voluntary muscles in the body,\r\nthose that move the eyeball. Choose some time when you are sitting\r\nquietly in your room, free from all disturbing thoughts and influences.\r\nThen stand up and, assuming an easy position, cast the eyes upward and\r\nhold them in that position for thirty seconds. Instantly and\r\ninvoluntarily you will be conscious of a tendency toward reverential,\r\ndevotional, contemplative ideas and thoughts. Then turn the eyes\r\nsideways, glancing directly to the right or to the left, through\r\nhalf-closed lids. Within thirty seconds images of suspicion, of\r\nuneasiness, or of dislike, will rise unbidden in the mind. Turn the eyes\r\nto one side and slightly downward, and suggestions of jealousy or\r\ncoquetry will be apt to spring unbidden. Direct your gaze downward\r\ntoward the floor, and you are likely to go off into a fit of reverie or\r\nof abstraction.\r\n\r\nIn fact, as Darwin long ago remarked, quoting in part from Bain: \"Most\r\nof our emotions [he should have said all] are so closely connected with\r\ntheir expression that they hardly exist if the body remains passive. As\r\nLouis XVI, facing a mob, exclaimed, 'Afraid? Feel my pulse!' so a man\r\nmay intensely hate another, but until his bodily frame is affected he\r\ncan hardly be said to be enraged.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, a little later, from Maudsley:--\r\n\r\n\"The specific muscular action is not merely an exponent of passion, but\r\ntruly an essential part of it. If we try, while the features are fixed\r\nin the expression of one passion, to call up in the mind a different\r\none, we shall find it impossible to do so.\"\r\n\r\nIt will also be recollected what an important part in the production of\r\nhypnosis and the trance state, fixed and strained positions of these\r\nsame ocular muscles have always been made to play. Many hypnotists can\r\nbring their subjects under their influence solely by having them gaze\r\nfixedly at some bright object like a mirror, or into a crystal sphere,\r\nfor a few minutes or even seconds.\r\n\r\nA graphic illustration of the importance of muscular action in emotional\r\nstates is the art of the actor. Not only would it be impossible for an\r\nactor to make an audience believe in the genuineness of his supposed\r\nemotion if he stood glassy-eyed and wooden-limbed declaiming his lines\r\nin a monotone, without gestures or play of expression of any sort, but\r\nit would also be impossible for him to feel even the counterfeit\r\nsensation which he is supposed to represent. So definite and so well\r\nrecognized is this connection, that many actors take some little time,\r\nas they express it, to \"warm up\" to their part, and can be visibly seen\r\nworking themselves up to the pitch of emotion desired for expression by\r\ntwitching muscles, contractions of the countenance, and catchings of the\r\nbreath. This last performance, by the way, is not by any means confined\r\nto the stage, but may be seen in operation in clashes and disagreements\r\nin real life. An individual who knows his case to be weak, or himself to\r\nbe lacking in determination, can be seen working himself up to the\r\nnecessary pitch of passion or of obstinacy. There is even a lovely old\r\nfairy-tale of our schoolboy days, which is still to be found in ancient\r\nworks on natural history, to the effect that the King of Beasts himself\r\nwas provided with a small, horny hook or spur at the end of his tail,\r\nwith which he lashed himself into a fury before springing upon his\r\nenemy!\r\n\r\nWhat, then, will be the physical effect of a shock or fright or furious\r\noutburst of anger upon the vital secretions? Obviously, that any\r\nprocesses which require a full or unusually large share of blood-supply\r\nfor their carrying out will be instantly stopped by the diversion of\r\nthis from their secreting cells, in the wall of the stomach, in the\r\nliver, or in the capillaries of the brain, to the great muscular masses\r\nof the body, or by some strange, atavistic reflex into the so-called\r\n\"abdominal pool,\" the portal circulation. The familiar results are just\r\nwhat might have been expected. The brain is so suddenly emptied of blood\r\nthat connected thought becomes impossible, and in extreme cases we stand\r\nas one paralyzed, until the terror that we would flee from crashes down\r\nupon us, or we lose consciousness and swoon away. If the process of\r\ndigestion happens to be going on, it is instantly stopped, leaving the\r\nfood to ferment and putrefy and poison the body-tissues which it would\r\notherwise have nourished. The cells of the liver may be so completely\r\ndeprived of blood as to stop forming bile out of broken-down blood\r\npigment, and the latter will gorge every vessel of the body and escape\r\ninto the tissues, producing jaundice.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows how the hearing of bad news or the cropping up of\r\ndisagreeable subjects in conversation at dinner-time will tend to\r\npromote indigestion instead of digestion. The mechanism is precisely\r\nsimilar. The disagreeable news, if it concern a financial or executive\r\ndifficulty, will cause a rush of blood to the brain for the purpose of\r\ndeciding what is to be done. But this diminishes the proper supply of\r\nblood to the stomach and to the digestive glands, just as really as the\r\nparalysis of violent fright or an explosion of furious anger. If the\r\nunpleasant subject is yet a little more irritating and personal, it will\r\nlead to a corresponding set of muscular actions, as evidenced in\r\nheightened color, loud tones, more or less violent gesticulation, with\r\nmarked interruption of both mastication and the secretion of saliva and\r\nall other digestive juices. In short, fully two-thirds of the influences\r\nof emotional mental states upon the body are produced by their calling\r\naway from the normal vital processes the blood which is needed for their\r\nmuscular and circulatory accompaniments. No matter how bad the news or\r\nhow serious the danger, if they fail to worry us or to frighten us,--in\r\nother words, to set up this complicated train of muscular and\r\nblood-supply changes,--then they have little or no effect upon our\r\ndigestions or the metabolism of our liver and kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe classic \"preying upon the damask cheek\" of grief, and the carking\r\neffect of the Black Care that rides behind the horseman, have a\r\nperfectly similar physical mechanism. While the primary disturbance of\r\nthe banking balances of the body is less, this is continued over weeks\r\nand months, and in addition introduces another factor hardly less\r\npotent, by interfering with all the healthful, normal, regular habits of\r\nthe body,--appetite, meal-times, sleep, recreation. These wastings and\r\npinings and fadings away are produced by mental influence, in the sense\r\nthat they cannot be cured by medicines or relieved at once by the best\r\nof hygienic advice; but it is idle to deny that they have also a broad\r\nand substantial physical basis, in the extent to which states of\r\nemotional agony, despair, or worry interfere with appetite, sleep, and\r\nproper exercise and recreation in the open air. Just as soon as they\r\ncease to interfere with this normal regularity of bodily functions, the\r\nsufferer begins to recover his health.\r\n\r\nWe even meet with the curious paradox of individuals who, though\r\nsuffering the keenest grief or anxiety over the loss or serious illness\r\nof those nearest or dearest to them, are positively mortified and\r\nashamed because their countenances show so little of the pallid hues and\r\nthe haggard lines supposed to be inseparably associated with grief. So\r\nlong as the body-surplus is abundant enough to stand the heavy\r\noverdrafts made on it by grief and mental distress, without robbing the\r\nstomach of its power to digest and the brain of its ability to sleep,\r\nthe physical effects of grief, and even of remorse, will be slight.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that loss of appetite is not in itself a cause of\r\ntrouble, but a symptom of the stomach's inability to digest food; in\r\nthis instance, because it finds that it can no longer draw upon the\r\nnatural resources of the body in sufficient abundance to carry out its\r\noperations. The state is exactly like a tightness of the money market,\r\nwhen, on account of unnatural retention or hoarding in some parts of the\r\nfinancial field, the accumulation of sufficient amounts of floating\r\ncapital at the banks for moving the crop or paying import duties cannot\r\nbe carried out as usual. The vital system is, in fact, in a state of\r\npanic, so that the stomach cannot get the temporary credit or capital\r\nwhich it requires.\r\n\r\nA similar condition of temporary panic, call it mental or bodily, as you\r\nwill, occurs in disease and is not confined to the so-called imaginary\r\ndiseases, or even to the diseases of the nervous system, but is apt to\r\nbe present in a large number of acute affections, especially those\r\nattended by pain. Sudden invasion of the system by the germs of\r\ninfectious diseases, with their explosions of toxin-shells all through\r\nthe redoubts of the body, often induces a disturbance of the bodily\r\nbalance akin to panic. This is usually accompanied and aggravated by an\r\nemotional dread and terror of corresponding intensity. The relief of the\r\nlatter, by the confident assurance of an expert and trusted physician\r\nthat the chances are ten to one that the disease will run its course in\r\na few days and the patient completely recover,--especially if coupled\r\nwith the administration of some drug which relieves pain or diminishes\r\ncongestion in the affected organs,--will often do much toward restoring\r\nbalance and putting the patient in a condition where the natural\r\nrecuperative powers of the system can begin their work. The historic\r\npopularity of opium, and of late of the coal-tar products (phenacetine\r\nand acetanilide), in the beginning of an acute illness, is largely based\r\non the power which they possess of dulling pain, relieving disturbances\r\nof the blood-balance, and soothing bodily and mental excitement.\r\nFever-panic or pain-panic, like a banking panic, though it has a genuine\r\nand substantial basis, can be dealt with and relieved much more readily\r\nafter checking excessive degrees of distrust and excitement. An opiate\r\nwill relieve this physical pain-panic, just as a strong mental\r\nimpression will relieve the fright-paralysis and emotional panic which\r\noften accompany it, and thus give a clearer field and a breathing space\r\nfor the more slowly acting recuperative powers of nature to assert their\r\ninfluence and get control of the situation.\r\n\r\n_But neither of them will cure._ The utmost that they can do is to give\r\na breathing spell, a lull in the storm, which the rallying powers of the\r\nbody, if present, can take advantage of. If the latter, however, be not\r\nadequate to the situation, the disease will progress to serious or even\r\nfatal termination, just as certainly as if no such influence had been\r\nexerted, and often at an accelerated rate. In fact, our dependence upon\r\nopiates and mental influence have been both a characteristic and a\r\ncause of the Dark Ages of medicine. The more we depended upon these, the\r\nmore content we were to remain in ignorance of the real causes of\r\ndisease, whether bodily or mental.\r\n\r\nThe second physical effect produced by mental influence is probably the\r\nmost important of all, and that is _the extent to which it induces the\r\npatient to follow good advice_. We as physicians would be the last to\r\nunderestimate the importance of the confidence of our patients. But we\r\nknow perfectly well that our retention of that confidence will depend\r\nalmost entirely upon the extent to which we can justify it; that its\r\nprincipal value to us lies in the extent to which it will insure prompt\r\nobedience to our orders, and intelligent and loyal coöperation with us\r\nin our fight against disease. The man who would depend upon the\r\nconfidence of his patients as a means of healing, would soon find\r\nhimself without practice. We know by the bitterest of experience that no\r\nmatter how absolute and boundless the confidence of our patients may be\r\nin our ability to heal them, no matter how much they may express\r\nthemselves as cheered and encouraged by our presence, ninety-nine per\r\ncent of the chance of their recovery depends upon the gravity of the\r\ndisease, the vigor of their powers of resistance, and our skill and\r\nintelligence in combating the one and assisting the other.\r\n\r\nValuable and helpful as courage and confidence in the sick-room are,\r\nthey are but a broken reed which will pierce the hand of him who leans\r\nupon it too heavily, be he patient or physician. We can all recall, as\r\namong our saddest and most heart-breaking experiences, the cases of\r\nfatal disease, which were well-nigh hopeless from the start, and yet in\r\nwhich the sufferers expressed, and maintained to the last moments of\r\nconscious speech, a bright and pathetically absolute confidence in our\r\npowers of healing, based upon our success in some previous case, or upon\r\ntheir own irrepressible hopefulness.\r\n\r\nEven the deadliest and most serious of infectious diseases, consumption,\r\nhas--as is well known--as one of its prominent symptoms an irrepressible\r\nhopefulness and confidence that they will get well, on the part of a\r\nconsiderable percentage of its victims. This has even been formally\r\ndesignated in the classical medical treatises as the \"_Spes Phthisica_,\"\r\nor \"Consumptive Hope.\" But these hopeful consumptives die just as surely\r\nas the depressed ones; in fact, if anything, in a little larger\r\nproportion. It well illustrates the other side of the shield of hope and\r\nconfidence, the danger of unwavering expectancy, in that it is chiefly\r\nthose who are early alarmed and turn vigorously to fight the disease\r\nunder intelligent medical direction, who make the recoveries. Too serene\r\na courage, too profound a confidence in occult forces, is only a form of\r\nfatalism and a very dangerous one.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, mental states in the sick-room are a pretty fair\r\nindex--I don't mind saying, product--of bodily states. Hopefulness and\r\nconfidence are usually favorable signs, for the reason that they are\r\nmost likely to be displayed by individuals who, although they may be\r\nseriously ill, are of good physique, have high resisting power, and\r\nwill make a successful fight against the disease. So, roughly speaking,\r\ncourage and hopefulness are good omens, on purely physical grounds.\r\n\r\nBut these are only rough indications of probabilities, not reliable\r\nsigns; and as a rule we are but little affected by either the hopes or\r\nthe fears of our patients in making up our estimate of their chances.\r\nThe only mental symptom that weighs heavily with us is indifference.\r\nThis puts us on the lookout at once. So long as our patients have a\r\nsufficiently vivid and lively fear of impending death, we feel pretty\r\nsure that they are not seriously ill; but when they assure us dreamily\r\nthat they \"feel first-rate,\" forget to ask us how they are getting\r\nalong, or become drowsily indifferent to the outlook for the future,\r\nthen we redouble our vigilance, for we fear that we recognize the\r\ngradual approach of the Great Restbringer, the merciful drowsiness which\r\nin nine cases out of ten precedes and heralds the coming of the Long\r\nSleep.\r\n\r\nLastly, the cases in which the sufferings of the patient are due chiefly\r\nto a morbid action of his or her imagination, are a small percentage of\r\nthe total of the ills which come before us for relief. But, even of this\r\nsmall percentage, _only a very few are in perfect or even reasonably\r\ngood physical health_. A large majority of even these neurasthenics,\r\npsychasthenics, imaginary invalids, and bodily or mental neurotics, have\r\nsome physical disturbance, organic or functional, which is the chief\r\ncause of their troubles. And the important point is that our success in\r\nrelieving these sufferers will depend upon our skill in ferreting out\r\nthis physical basis, and the extent to which we can succeed in\r\ncorrecting or relieving it. We no longer ridicule or laugh at these\r\nunfortunates. On the contrary we pity them from the bottom of our\r\nhearts, because we know that their sufferings, however polarly remote\r\nthey may be from endangering their lives in any way, and however\r\nimaginary in a purely material sense, are _to them_ real. Their\r\nhappiness is destroyed and their efficiency is crippled just as\r\ngenuinely and effectively as if they had a broken limb or a diseased\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWe are now more and more firmly convinced that these patients, however\r\nludicrously absurd their forebodings, are _really sick_, either bodily\r\nor mentally, and probably both. A perfectly healthy individual seldom\r\nimagines himself or herself to be ill. And as the list of so-called\r\nfunctional diseases--that is to say, those diseases in which no\r\ndefinite, objective mark of degeneration or decay in any tissue or organ\r\ncan be discovered--are steadily and swiftly diminishing under the\r\nscrutiny of the microscope and the methods of the laboratory, so these\r\npurely imaginary diseases, these \"depressed mental states,\" these\r\n\"essential morbid tendencies,\" are also rapidly diminishing in number,\r\nas cases are more conscientiously and personally studied and worked out.\r\n\r\nEven hysteria is no longer looked upon as sheer perversity on the part\r\nof the patient, but is patiently traced back, stage by stage, until if\r\npossible the primary \"strangulated emotion\" which caused it is\r\ndiscovered; and where this can be found the whole morbid tendency can\r\noften be relieved and reversed almost as if by magic.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: My contention is, that the direct influence of emotional\r\nstates upon bodily organs and functions has been greatly exaggerated;\r\nthat it is exceedingly doubtful whether, for instance, any individual in\r\na reasonable condition of health was ever killed by an imaginary or even\r\nan emotional shock; that there is surprisingly little valid evidence\r\nthat the hair of any human being turned white in a single night, or was\r\ncompletely shed within a few hours, under the influence of fright,\r\nterror, or grief; that the effects upon bodily functions and secretions,\r\ndigestion, etc., produced by emotion, are due to secondary effects of\r\nthe latter, diverting the energy of the body into other channels and\r\ndisturbing the general balance of its forces and blood-supply; that the\r\nactual percentage of cases in which the imagination plays the chief, or\r\neven a dominant part, is small, probably not to exceed five or ten per\r\ncent; that a very considerable share of the influence of mental\r\nimpressions in the cure of disease is due to the relief of mental panic,\r\npermitting the rallying of the recuperative powers of the body, and to\r\nthe extent to which they produce the reform of bad physical habits or\r\nsurroundings or conditions.\r\n\r\nThe most important element in the cure of disease by mental\r\nimpression is _time_ plus the _vis medicatrix naturæ_. The mental\r\nimpression--suggestion, scolding, securing of confidence--diverts the\r\nattention of the patient until his own recuperative power and the\r\nintelligent correction of bad physical habits remedy his defect. Pure\r\nmental impression, however vivid, which is not followed up by\r\nimprovement of the environment, or correction of bad physical habits,\r\nwill be almost absolutely sterile. Faith without works is as dead in\r\nmedicine as in religion. Mental influence is little more than an\r\nintroduction committee to real treatment. Even the means used for\r\nproducing mental impressions are physical,--impressions made upon some\r\none of the five senses of the individual. In short, as Barker aptly puts\r\nit, \"Every psychotherapy is also a physical therapy.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even mental worry, distress, or depression, in nine cases\r\nout of ten has a physical cause. To remedy conditions of mental stress\r\nby correcting the underpay, overwork, bad ventilation, or underfeeding\r\non account of illness or death of the wage-earner of the family, is, of\r\ncourse, nothing but the most admirable common sense; but to call it the\r\n_mental_ treatment of disease is a mere juggling with words. \"Take care\r\nof the body and the mind will take care of itself,\" is a maxim which\r\nwill prove valid in actual practice nine times out of ten.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abernethy, Dr. John, 80.\r\n\r\n  Acne, 38.\r\n\r\n  Acromegaly, 119.\r\n\r\n  Adenoids, 105-122.\r\n\r\n  Air, foul, 97.\r\n\r\n  Alimentary canal, 274-279.\r\n\r\n  Allbutt, Sir Clifford, 134.\r\n\r\n  Allen, Dr. Harrison, 120.\r\n\r\n  Animals, immune to certain diseases, 255.\r\n\r\n  Anti-bodies. _See_ Antitoxins.\r\n\r\n  Antisepsis, 333, 336-339.\r\n\r\n  Antitoxins, or anti-bodies, 9, 93, 94, 199, 200;\r\n    discovery and use of the diphtheria antitoxin, 230-233, 236, 242, 401;\r\n    tetanus antitoxin, 345, 346, 398.\r\n\r\n  Apoplexy, 40, 402.\r\n\r\n  Appendicitis, 269-288.\r\n\r\n  Appendix, vermiform, 35, 36, 268-270, 273-279.\r\n\r\n  Asepsis, 333.\r\n\r\n  Asthmatics, 328.\r\n\r\n  Attitude, the upright, 76.\r\n\r\n  Autointoxication, 376.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bacilli. _See_ Bacteria.\r\n\r\n  Bacteria, abundance of, in the body, 10, 99.\r\n\r\n  Bang, Professor, 148.\r\n\r\n  Bath, the cold, 98.\r\n\r\n  Bile, in vomiting, 379.\r\n\r\n  Bites, danger from, 342.\r\n\r\n  Blood, coagulation of, 39, 40.\r\n\r\n  Blood-corpuscles, 24-29.\r\n\r\n  Blood-poisoning, 331-349.\r\n\r\n  Bloodgood, Dr. J.
