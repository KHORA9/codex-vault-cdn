ALCOTT\r\n\r\n\"Which, naming no names, no offense could be took.\"—Sairy Gamp \r\n\r\nBoston:\r\nJames Redpath, Publisher,\r\n221 Washington Street.\r\n1863.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1863, by\r\n\r\nJames Redpath,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the District of\r\nMassachusetts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese sketches\r\nare respectfully dedicated\r\nto her friend\r\nMiss Hannah Stevenson,\r\nby\r\nL. M. A.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublisher's Advertisement.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of this volume was published in successive\r\nnumbers of The Commonwealth, newspaper, of Boston. The sudden popularity\r\nthe Sketches won from the general public, and the praise they received\r\nfrom literary men of distinguished ability, are sufficient\r\nreasons,--were any needed,--for their re-publication, thus revised and\r\nenlarged, in this more convenient and permanent form. As, besides paying\r\nthe Author the usual copyright, the publisher has resolved to devote at\r\nleast five cents of every copy sold to the support of orphans made\r\nfatherless or homeless by the war, no reproduction of any part of the\r\ncontents now first printed in these pages, will be permitted in any\r\njournal. Should the sale of the little book be large, the orphans'\r\npercentage will be doubled.\r\n\r\nBoston, August, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Contents\r\nChapter    Chapter Title       Page\r\n  I.

First live, then write.\"\r\n\r\n\"Try teaching again,\" suggested my mother.\r\n\r\n\"No thank you, ma'am, ten years of that is enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a husband like my Darby, and fulfill your mission,\" said sister\r\nJoan, home on a visit.\r\n\r\n\"Can't afford expensive luxuries, Mrs. Coobiddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn actress, and immortalize your name,\" said sister Vashti, striking\r\nan attitude.\r\n\r\n\"I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go nurse the soldiers,\" said my young brother, Tom, panting for \"the\r\ntented field.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will!\"\r\n\r\nSo far, very good. Here was the will--now for the way. At first sight\r\nnot a foot of it appeared, but that didn't matter, for the Periwinkles\r\nare a hopeful race; their crest is an anchor, with three cock-a-doodles\r\ncrowing atop. They all wear rose-colored spectacles, and are lineal\r\ndescendants of the inventor of aerial architecture. An hour's\r\nconversation on the subject set the whole family in a blaze of\r\nenthusiasm. A model hospital was erected, and each member had accepted\r\nan honorable post therein. The paternal P. was chaplain, the maternal\r\nP. was matron, and all the youthful P.s filled the pod of futurity with\r\nachievements whose brilliancy eclipsed the glories of the present and\r\nthe past. Arriving at this satisfactory conclusion, the meeting\r\nadjourned, and the fact that Miss Tribulation was available as army\r\nnurse went abroad on the wings of the wind.\r\n\r\nIn a few days a townswoman heard of my desire, approved of it, and\r\nbrought about an interview with one of the sisterhood which I wished to\r\njoin, who was at home on a furlough, and able and willing to satisfy\r\nall inquiries. A morning chat with Miss General S.--we hear no end of\r\nMrs. Generals, why not a Miss?--produced three results: I felt that I\r\ncould do the work, was offered a place, and accepted it, promising not\r\nto desert, but stand ready to march on Washington at an hour's notice.\r\n\r\nA few days were necessary for the letter containing my request and\r\nrecommendation to reach headquarters, and another, containing my\r\ncommission, to return; therefore no time was to be lost; and heartily\r\nthanking my pair of friends, I tore home through the December slush as\r\nif the rebels were after me, and like many another recruit, burst in\r\nupon my family with the announcement--\r\n\r\n\"I've enlisted!\"\r\n\r\nAn impressive silence followed. Tom, the irrepressible, broke it with a\r\nslap on the shoulder and the graceful compliment--\r\n\r\n\"Old Trib, you're a trump!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; then I'll _take_ something:\" which I did, in the shape of\r\ndinner, reeling off my news at the rate of three dozen words to a\r\nmouthful; and as every one else talked equally fast, and all together,\r\nthe scene was most inspiring.\r\n\r\nAs boys going to sea immediately become nautical in speech, walk as if\r\nthey already had their \"sea legs\" on, and shiver their timbers on all\r\npossible occasions, so I turned military at once, called my dinner my\r\nrations, saluted all new comers, and ordered a dress parade that very\r\nafternoon. Having reviewed every rag I possessed, I detailed some for\r\npicket duty while airing over the fence; some to the sanitary\r\ninfluences of the wash-tub; others to mount guard in the trunk; while\r\nthe weak and wounded went to the Work-basket Hospital, to be made ready\r\nfor active service again. To this squad I devoted myself for a week;\r\nbut all was done, and I had time to get powerfully impatient before the\r\nletter came. It did arrive however, and brought a disappointment along\r\nwith its good will and friendliness, for it told me that the place in\r\nthe Armory Hospital that I supposed I was to take, was already filled,\r\nand a much less desirable one at Hurly-burly House was offered instead.\r\n\r\n\"That's just your luck, Trib. I'll tote your trunk up garret for you\r\nagain; for of course you won't go,\" Tom remarked, with the disdainful\r\npity which small boys affect when they get into their teens. I was\r\nwavering in my secret soul, but that settled the matter, and I crushed\r\nhim on the spot with martial brevity--\r\n\r\n\"It is now one; I shall march at six.\"\r\n\r\nI have a confused recollection of spending the afternoon in pervading\r\nthe house like an executive whirlwind, with my family swarming after\r\nme, all working, talking, prophesying and lamenting, while I packed my\r\n\"go-abroady\" possessions, tumbled the rest into two big boxes, danced\r\non the lids till they shut, and gave them in charge, with the\r\ndirection,--\r\n\r\n\"If I never come back, make a bonfire of them.\"\r\n\r\nThen I choked down a cup of tea, generously salted instead of sugared,\r\nby some agitated relative, shouldered my knapsack--it was only a\r\ntraveling bag, but do let me preserve the unities--hugged my family\r\nthree times all round without a vestige of unmanly emotion, till a\r\ncertain dear old lady broke down upon my neck, with a despairing sort\r\nof wail--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, my dear, how can I let you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll stay if you say so, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't; go, and the Lord will take care of you.\"\r\n\r\nMuch of the Roman matron's courage had gone into the Yankee matron's\r\ncomposition, and, in spite of her tears, she would have sent ten sons\r\nto the war, had she possessed them, as freely as she sent one daughter,\r\nsmiling and flapping on the door-step till I vanished, though the eyes\r\nthat followed me were very dim, and the handkerchief she waved was very\r\nwet.\r\n\r\nMy transit from The Gables to the village depot was a funny mixture of\r\ngood wishes and good byes, mud-puddles and shopping. A December\r\ntwilight is not the most cheering time to enter upon a somewhat\r\nperilous enterprise, and, but for the presence of Vashti and neighbor\r\nThorn, I fear that I might have added a drop of the briny to the native\r\nmoisture of--\r\n\r\n    \"The town I left behind me;\"\r\n\r\nthough I'd no thought of giving out: oh, bless you, no! When the engine\r\nscreeched \"Here we are,\" I clutched my escort in a fervent embrace, and\r\nskipped into the car with as blithe a farewell as if going on a bridal\r\ntour--though I believe brides don't usually wear cavernous black\r\nbonnets and fuzzy brown coats, with a hair-brush, a pair of rubbers,\r\ntwo books, and a bag of ginger-bread distorting the pockets of the\r\nsame. If I thought that any one would believe it, I'd boldly state that\r\nI slept from C. to B., which would simplify matters immensely; but as I\r\nknow they wouldn't, I'll confess that the head under the funereal\r\ncoal-hod fermented with all manner of high thoughts and heroic purposes\r\n\"to do or die,\"--perhaps both; and the heart under the fuzzy brown coat\r\nfelt very tender with the memory of the dear old lady, probably sobbing\r\nover her army socks and the loss of her topsy-turvy Trib. At this\r\njuncture I took the veil, and what I did behind it is nobody's\r\nbusiness; but I maintain that the soldier who cries when his mother\r\nsays \"Good bye,\" is the boy to fight best, and die bravest, when the\r\ntime comes, or go back to her better than he went.\r\n\r\nTill nine o'clock I trotted about the city streets, doing those last\r\nerrands which no woman would even go to heaven without attempting, if\r\nshe could. Then I went to my usual refuge, and, fully intending to keep\r\nawake, as a sort of vigil appropriate to the occasion, fell fast asleep\r\nand dreamed propitious dreams till my rosy-faced cousin waked me with a\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nA bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at ten I reported myself to\r\nmy General, received last instructions and no end of the sympathetic\r\nencouragement which women give, in look, touch, and tone more\r\neffectually than in words. The next step was to get a free pass to\r\nWashington, for I'd no desire to waste my substance on railroad\r\ncompanies when \"the boys\" needed even a spinster's mite. A friend of\r\nmine had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise, though\r\nI had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish it. I'm a\r\nbashful individual, though I can't get any one to believe it; so it\r\ncost me a great effort to poke about the Worcester depot till the right\r\ndoor appeared, then walk into a room containing several gentlemen, and\r\nblunder out my request in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing\r\ncould have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it was\r\nevident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had asked for the\r\nnose off his respectable face. He referred me to the Governor at the\r\nState House, and I backed out, leaving him no doubt to regret that such\r\nmild maniacs were left at large. Here was a Scylla and Charybdis\r\nbusiness: as if a President wasn't trying enough, without the Governor\r\nof Massachusetts and the hub of the hub piled on top of that. \"I never\r\ncan do it,\" thought I. \"Tom will hoot at you if you don't,\" whispered\r\nthe inconvenient little voice that is always goading people to the\r\nperformance of disagreeable duties, and always appeals to the most\r\neffective agent to produce the proper result. The idea of allowing any\r\nboy that ever wore a felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic\r\ntail, to crow over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap\r\nfor such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the Common,\r\nwondering if I ought to say \"your Honor,\" or simply \"Sir,\" and decided\r\nupon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections of an evening in\r\na charming green library, where I beheld the Governor placidly\r\nconsuming oysters, and laughing as if Massachusetts was a myth, and he\r\nhad no heavier burden on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands.\r\n\r\nLike an energetic fly in a very large cobweb, I struggled through the\r\nState House, getting into all the wrong rooms and none of the right,\r\ntill I turned desperate, and went into one, resolving not to come out\r\ntill I'd made somebody hear and answer me. I suspect that of all the\r\nwrong places I had blundered into, this was the most so. But I didn't\r\ncare; and, though the apartment was full of soldiers, surgeons,\r\nstarers, and spittoons, I cornered a perfectly incapable person, and\r\nproceeded to pump for information with the following result:\r\n\r\n\"Was the Governor anywhere about?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he wasn't.\r\n\r\n\"Could he tell me where to look?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he couldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Did he know anything about free passes?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he didn't.\r\n\r\n\"Was there any one there of whom I could inquire?\"\r\n\r\nNot a person.\r\n\r\n\"Did he know of any place where information could be obtained?\"\r\n\r\nNot a place.\r\n\r\n\"Could he throw the smallest gleam of light upon the matter, in any\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\nNot a ray.\r\n\r\nI am naturally irascible, and if I could have shaken this negative\r\ngentleman vigorously, the relief would have been immense. The\r\nprejudices of society forbidding this mode of redress, I merely\r\nglowered at him; and, before my wrath found vent in words, my General\r\nappeared, having seen me from an opposite window, and come to know what\r\nI was about. At her command the languid gentleman woke up, and troubled\r\nhimself to remember that Major or Sergeant or something Mc K. knew all\r\nabout the tickets, and his office was in Milk Street. I perked up\r\ninstanter, and then, as if the exertion was too much for him, what did\r\nthis animated wet blanket do but add--\r\n\r\n\"I think Mc K. may have left Milk Street, now, and I don't know where\r\nhe has gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; the new comers will know where he has moved to, my dear,\r\nso don't be discouraged; and if you don't succeed, come to me, and we\r\nwill see what to do next,\" said my General.\r\n\r\nI blessed her in a fervent manner and a cool hall, fluttered round the\r\ncorner, and bore down upon Milk Street, bent on discovering Mc K. if\r\nsuch a being was to be found. He wasn't, and the ignorance of the\r\nneighborhood was really pitiable. Nobody knew anything, and after\r\ntumbling over bundles of leather, bumping against big boxes, being\r\nnearly annihilated by descending bales, and sworn at by aggravated\r\ntruckmen, I finally elicited the advice to look for Mc K. in Haymarket\r\nSquare. Who my informant was I've really forgotten; for, having hailed\r\nseveral busy gentlemen, some one of them fabricated this delusive\r\nquietus for the perturbed spirit, who instantly departed to the\r\nsequestered locality he named. If I had been in search of the\r\nKoh-i-noor diamond I should have been as likely to find it there as any\r\nvestige of Mc K. I stared at signs, inquired in shops, invaded an\r\neating house, visited the recruiting tent in the middle of the Square,\r\nmade myself a nuisance generally, and accumulated mud enough to retard\r\nanother Nile. All in vain: and I mournfully turned my face toward the\r\nGeneral's, feeling that I should be forced to enrich the railroad\r\ncompany after all; when, suddenly, I beheld that admirable young man,\r\nbrother-in-law Darby Coobiddy, Esq. I arrested him with a burst of\r\nnews, and wants, and woes, which caused his manly countenance to lose\r\nits usual repose.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear boy, I'm going to Washington at five, and I can't find the\r\nfree ticket man, and there won't be time to see Joan, and I'm so tired\r\nand cross I don't know what to do; and will you help me, like a cherub\r\nas you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, of course. I know a fellow who will set us right,\" responded\r\nDarby, mildly excited, and darting into some kind of an office, held\r\ncounsel with an invisible angel, who sent him out radiant. \"All serene.\r\nI've got him. I'll see you through the business, and then get Joan from\r\nthe Dove Cote in time to see you off.\"\r\n\r\nI'm a woman's rights woman, and if any man had offered help in the\r\nmorning, I should have condescendingly refused it, sure that I could do\r\neverything as well, if not better, myself. My strong-mindedness had\r\nrather abated since then, and I was now quite ready to be a \"timid\r\ntrembler,\" if necessary. Dear me! how easily Darby did it all: he just\r\nasked one question, received an answer, tucked me under his arm, and in\r\nten minutes I stood in the presence of Mc K., the Desired.\r\n\r\n\"Now my troubles are over,\" thought I, and as usual was direfully\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to get a pass from Dr. H., in Temple Place, before I can\r\ngive you a pass, madam,\" answered Mc K., as blandly as if he wasn't\r\ncarrying desolation to my soul. Oh, indeed! why didn't he send me to\r\nDorchester Heights, India Wharf, or Bunker Hill Monument, and done with\r\nit? Here I was, after a morning's tramp, down in some place about Dock\r\nSquare, and was told to step to Temple Place. Nor was that all; he\r\nmight as well have asked me to catch a humming-bird, toast a salamander,\r\nor call on the man in the moon, as find a Doctor at home at the busiest\r\nhour of the day. It was a blow; but weariness had extinguished\r\nenthusiasm, and resignation clothed me as a garment. I sent Darby for\r\nJoan, and doggedly paddled off, feeling that mud was my native element,\r\nand quite sure that the evening papers would announce the appearance of\r\nthe Wandering Jew, in feminine habiliments.\r\n\r\n\"Is Dr. H. in?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mum, he aint.\"\r\n\r\nOf course he wasn't; I knew that before I asked: and, considering it\r\nall in the light of a hollow mockery, added:\r\n\r\n\"When will he probably return?\"\r\n\r\nIf the damsel had said, \"ten to-night,\" I should have felt a grim\r\nsatisfaction, in the fulfillment of my own dark prophecy; but she said,\r\n\"At two, mum;\" and I felt it a personal insult.\r\n\r\n\"I'll call, then. Tell him my business is important:\" with which\r\nmysteriously delivered message I departed, hoping that I left her\r\nconsumed with curiosity; for mud rendered me an object of interest.\r\n\r\nBy way of resting myself, I crossed the Common, for the third time,\r\nbespoke the carriage, got some lunch, packed my purchases, smoothed my\r\nplumage, and was back again, as the clock struck two. The Doctor hadn't\r\ncome yet; and I was morally certain that he would not, till, having\r\nwaited till the last minute, I was driven to buy a ticket, and, five\r\nminutes after the irrevocable deed was done, he would be at my service,\r\nwith all manner of helpful documents and directions. Everything goes by\r\ncontraries with me; so, having made up my mind to be disappointed, of\r\ncourse I wasn't; for, presently, in walked Dr. H., and no sooner had he\r\nheard my errand, and glanced at my credentials, than he said, with the\r\nmost engaging readiness:\r\n\r\n\"I will give you the order, with pleasure, madam.\"\r\n\r\nWords cannot express how soothing and delightful it was to find, at\r\nlast, somebody who could do what I wanted, without sending me from Dan\r\nto Beersheba, for a dozen other bodies to do something else first. Peace\r\ndescended, like oil, upon the ruffled waters of my being, as I sat\r\nlistening to the busy scratch of his pen; and, when he turned about,\r\ngiving me not only the order, but a paper of directions wherewith to\r\nsmooth away all difficulties between Boston and Washington, I felt as\r\ndid poor Christian when the Evangelist gave him the scroll, on the safe\r\nside of the Slough of Despond. I've no doubt many dismal nurses have\r\ninflicted themselves upon the worthy gentleman since then; but I am\r\nsure none have been more kindly helped, or are more grateful, than T.\r\nP.; for that short interview added another to the many pleasant\r\nassociations that already surround his name.\r\n\r\nFeeling myself no longer a \"Martha Struggles,\" but a comfortable young\r\nwoman, with plain sailing before her, and the worst of the voyage well\r\nover, I once more presented myself to the valuable Mc K. The order was\r\nread, and certain printed papers, necessary to be filled out, were\r\ngiven a young gentleman--no, I prefer to say Boy, with a scornful\r\nemphasis upon the word, as the only means of revenge now left me. This\r\nBoy, instead of doing his duty with the diligence so charming in the\r\nyoung, loitered and lounged, in a manner which proved his education to\r\nhave been sadly neglected in the--\r\n\r\n    \"How doth the little busy bee,\"\r\n\r\ndirection. He stared at me, gaped out of the window, ate peanuts, and\r\ngossiped with his neighbors--Boys, like himself, and all penned in a\r\nrow, like colts at a Cattle Show. I don't imagine he knew the anguish\r\nhe was inflicting; for it was nearly three, the train left at five, and\r\nI had my ticket to get, my dinner to eat, my blessed sister to see, and\r\nthe depot to reach, if I didn't die of apoplexy. Meanwhile, Patience\r\ncertainly had her perfect work that day, and I hope she enjoyed the job\r\nmore than I did. Having waited some twenty minutes, it pleased this\r\nreprehensible Boy to make various marks and blots on my documents, toss\r\nthem to a venerable creature of sixteen, who delivered them to me with\r\nsuch paternal directions, that it only needed a pat on the head and an\r\nencouraging--\"Now run home to your Ma, little girl, and mind the\r\ncrossings, my dear,\" to make the illusion quite perfect.\r\n\r\nWhy I was sent to a steamboat office for car tickets, is not for me to\r\nsay, though I went as meekly as I should have gone to the Probate\r\nCourt, if sent. A fat, easy gentleman gave me several bits of paper,\r\nwith coupons attached, with a warning not to separate them, which\r\ninstantly inspired me with a yearning to pluck them apart, and see what\r\ncame of it. But, remembering through what fear and tribulation I had\r\nobtained them, I curbed Satan's promptings, and, clutching my prize, as\r\nif it were my pass to the Elysian Fields, I hurried home. Dinner was\r\nrapidly consumed; Joan enlightened, comforted, and kissed; the dearest\r\nof apple-faced cousins hugged; the kindest of apple-faced cousins'\r\nfathers subjected to the same process; and I mounted the ambulance,\r\nbaggage-wagon, or anything you please but hack, and drove away, too\r\ntired to feel excited, sorry, or glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA FORWARD MOVEMENT.\r\n\r\nAs travellers like to give their own impressions of a journey, though\r\nevery inch of the way may have been described a half a dozen times\r\nbefore, I add some of the notes made by the way, hoping that they will\r\namuse the reader, and convince the skeptical that such a being as Nurse\r\nPeriwinkle does exist, that she really did go to Washington, and that\r\nthese Sketches are not romance.\r\n\r\nNew York Train--Seven P. M.--Spinning along to take the boat at New\r\nLondon. Very comfortable; munch gingerbread, and Mrs. C.'s fine pear,\r\nwhich deserves honorable mention, because my first loneliness was\r\ncomforted by it, and pleasant recollections of both kindly sender and\r\nbearer. Look much at Dr. H.'s paper of directions--put my tickets in\r\nevery conceivable place, that they may be get-at-able, and finish by\r\nlosing them entirely. Suffer agonies till a compassionate neighbor\r\npokes them out of a crack with his pen-knife. Put them in the inmost\r\ncorner of my purse, that in the deepest recesses of my pocket, pile a\r\ncollection of miscellaneous articles atop, and pin up the whole. Just\r\nget composed, feeling that I've done my best to keep them safely, when\r\nthe Conductor appears, and I'm forced to rout them all out again,\r\nexposing my precautions, and getting into a flutter at keeping the man\r\nwaiting. Finally, fasten them on the seat before me, and keep one eye\r\nsteadily upon the yellow torments, till I forget all about them, in\r\nchat with the gentleman who shares my seat. Having heard complaints of\r\nthe absurd way in which American women become images of petrified\r\npropriety, if addressed by strangers, when traveling alone, the inborn\r\nperversity of my nature causes me to assume an entirely opposite style\r\nof deportment; and, finding my companion hails from Little Athens, is\r\nacquainted with several of my three hundred and sixty-five cousins, and\r\nin every way a respectable and respectful member of society, I put my\r\nbashfulness in my pocket, and plunge into a long conversation on the\r\nwar, the weather, music, Carlyle, skating, genius, hoops, and the\r\nimmortality of the soul.\r\n\r\nTen P. M.--Very sleepy. Nothing to be seen outside, but darkness made\r\nvisible; nothing inside but every variety of bunch into which the human\r\nform can be twisted, rolled, or \"massed,\" as Miss Prescott says of her\r\njewels. Every man's legs sprawl drowsily, every woman's head (but\r\nmine,) nods, till it finally settles on somebody's shoulder, a new\r\nproof of the truth of the everlasting oak and vine simile; children\r\nfret; lovers whisper; old folks snore, and somebody privately imbibes\r\nbrandy, when the lamps go out. The penetrating perfume rouses the\r\nmultitude, causing some to start up, like war horses at the smell of\r\npowder. When the lamps are relighted, every one laughs, sniffs, and\r\nlooks inquiringly at his neighbor--every one but a stout gentleman,\r\nwho, with well-gloved hands folded upon his broad-cloth rotundity,\r\nsleeps on impressively. Had he been innocent, he would have waked up;\r\nfor, to slumber in that babe-like manner, with a car full of giggling,\r\nstaring, sniffing humanity, was simply preposterous. Public suspicion\r\nwas down upon him at once. I doubt if the appearance of a flat black\r\nbottle with a label would have settled the matter more effectually than\r\ndid the over dignified and profound repose of this short-sighted being.\r\nHis moral neck-cloth, virtuous boots, and pious attitude availed him\r\nnothing, and it was well he kept his eyes shut, for \"Humbug!\" twinkled\r\nat him from every window-pane, brass nail and human eye around him.\r\n\r\nEleven, P. M.--In the boat \"City of Boston,\" escorted thither by my car\r\nacquaintance, and deposited in the cabin. Trying to look as if the\r\ngreater portion of my life had been passed on board boats, but\r\npainfully conscious that I don't know the first thing; so sit bolt\r\nupright, and stare about me till I hear one lady say to another--\"We\r\nmust secure our berths at once;\" whereupon I dart at one, and, while\r\nleisurely taking off my cloak, wait to discover what the second move\r\nmay be. Several ladies draw the curtains that hang in a semi-circle\r\nbefore each nest--instantly I whisk mine smartly together, and then\r\npeep out to see what next. Gradually, on hooks above the blue and\r\nyellow drapery, appear the coats and bonnets of my neighbors, while\r\ntheir boots and shoes, in every imaginable attitude, assert themselves\r\nbelow, as if their owners had committed suicide in a body. A violent\r\ncreaking, scrambling, and fussing, causes the fact that people are\r\ngoing regularly to bed to dawn upon my mind. Of course they are! and so\r\nam I--but pause at the seventh pin, remembering that, as I was born to\r\nbe drowned, an eligible opportunity now presents itself; and, having\r\ntwice escaped a watery grave, the third immersion will certainly\r\nextinguish my vital spark. The boat is new, but if it ever intends to\r\nblow up, spring a leak, catch afire, or be run into, it will do the\r\ndeed tonight, because I'm here to fulfill my destiny. With tragic\r\ncalmness I resign myself, replace my pins, lash my purse and papers\r\ntogether, with my handkerchief, examine the saving circumference of my\r\nhoop, and look about me for any means of deliverance when the moist\r\nmoment shall arrive; for I've no intention of folding my hands and\r\nbubbling to death without an energetic splashing first. Barrels,\r\nhen-coops, portable settees, and life-preservers do not adorn the\r\ncabin, as they should; and, roving wildly to and fro, my eye sees no\r\nray of hope till it falls upon a plump old lady, devoutly reading in\r\nthe cabin Bible, and a voluminous night-cap. I remember that, at the\r\nswimming school, fat girls always floated best, and in an instant my\r\nplan is laid. At the first alarm I firmly attach myself to the plump\r\nlady, and cling to her through fire and water; for I feel that my old\r\nenemy, the cramp, will seize me by the foot, if I attempt to swim; and,\r\nthough I can hardly expect to reach Jersey City with myself and my\r\nbaggage in as good condition as I hoped, I might manage to get picked\r\nup by holding to my fat friend; if not it will be a comfort to feel\r\nthat I've made an effort and shall die in good society. Poor dear\r\nwoman! how little she dreamed, as she read and rocked, with her cap in\r\na high state of starch, and her feet comfortably cooking at the\r\nregister, what fell designs were hovering about her, and how intently a\r\nsmall but determined eye watched her, till it suddenly closed.\r\n\r\nSleep got the better of fear to such an extent that my boots appeared\r\nto gape, and my bonnet nodded on its peg, before I gave in. Having\r\npiled my cloak, bag, rubbers, books and umbrella on the lower shelf, I\r\ndrowsily swarmed onto the upper one, tumbling down a few times, and\r\nexcoriating the knobby portions of my frame in the act. A very brief\r\nnap on the upper roost was enough to set me gasping as if a dozen\r\nfeather beds and the whole boat were laid over me. Out I turned; and,\r\nafter a series of convulsions, which caused my neighbor to ask if I\r\nwanted the stewardess, I managed to get my luggage up and myself down.\r\nBut even in the lower berth, my rest was not unbroken, for various\r\narticles kept dropping off the little shelf at the bottom of the bed,\r\nand every time I flew up, thinking my hour had come, I bumped my head\r\nseverely against the little shelf at the top, evidently put there for\r\nthat express purpose. At last, after listening to the swash of the\r\nwaves outside, wondering if the machinery usually creaked in that way,\r\nand watching a knot-hole in the side of my berth, sure that death would\r\ncreep in there as soon as I took my eye from it, I dropped asleep, and\r\ndreamed of muffins.\r\n\r\nFive, A. M.--On deck, trying to wake up and enjoy an east wind and a\r\nmorning fog, and a twilight sort of view of something on the shore.\r\nRapidly achieve my purpose, and do enjoy every moment, as we go rushing\r\nthrough the Sound, with steamboats passing up and down, lights dancing\r\non the shore, mist wreaths slowly furling off, and a pale pink sky\r\nabove us, as the sun comes up.\r\n\r\nSeven A.M.--In the cars, at Jersey City. Much fuss with tickets, which\r\none man scribbles over, another snips, and a third \"makes note on.\"\r\nPartake of refreshment, in the gloom of a very large and dirty depot.\r\nThink that my sandwiches would be more relishing without so strong a\r\nflavor of napkin, and my gingerbread more easy of consumption if it had\r\nnot been pulverized by being sat upon. People act as if early traveling\r\ndidn't agree with them. Children scream and scamper; men smoke and\r\ngrowl; women shiver and fret; porters swear; great truck horses pace up\r\nand down with loads of baggage; and every one seems to get into the\r\nwrong car, and come tumbling out again. One man, with three children, a\r\ndog, a bird-cage, and several bundles, puts himself and his possessions\r\ninto every possible place where a man, three children, dog, bird-cage\r\nand bundles could be got, and is satisfied with none of them. I follow\r\ntheir movements, with an interest that is really exhausting, and, as\r\nthey vanish, hope for rest, but don't get it. A strong-minded woman,\r\nwith a tumbler in her hand, and no cloak or shawl on, comes rushing\r\nthrough the car, talking loudly to a small porter, who lugs a folding\r\nbed after her, and looks as if life were a burden to him.\r\n\r\n\"You promised to have it ready. It is not ready. It must be a car with\r\na water jar, the windows must be shut, the fire must be kept up, the\r\nblinds must be down. No, this won't do. I shall go through the whole\r\ntrain, and suit myself, for you promised to have it ready. It is not\r\nready,\" &c., all through again, like a hand-organ. She haunted the\r\ncars, the depot, the office and baggage-room, with her bed, her\r\ntumbler, and her tongue, till the train started; and a sense of fervent\r\ngratitude filled my soul, when I found that she and her unknown invalid\r\nwere not to share our car.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia.--An old place, full of Dutch women, in \"bellus top\"\r\nbonnets, selling vegetables, in long, open markets. Every one seems to\r\nbe scrubbing their white steps. All the houses look like tidy jails,\r\nwith their outside shutters. Several have crape on the door-handles,\r\nand many have flags flying from roof or balcony. Few men appear, and\r\nthe women seem to do the business, which, perhaps, accounts for its\r\nbeing so well done. Pass fine buildings, but don't know what they are.\r\nWould like to stop and see my native city; for, having left it at the\r\ntender age of two, my recollections are not vivid.\r\n\r\nBaltimore.--A big, dirty, shippy, shiftless place, full of goats,\r\ngeese, colored people, and coal, at least the part of it I see. Pass\r\nnear the spot where the riot took place, and feel as if I should enjoy\r\nthrowing a stone at somebody, hard. Find a guard at the ferry, the\r\ndepot, and here and there, along the road. A camp whitens one\r\nhill-side, and a cavalry training school, or whatever it should be\r\ncalled, is a very interesting sight, with quantities of horses and\r\nriders galloping, marching, leaping, and skirmishing, over all manner\r\nof break-neck places. A party of English people get in--the men, with\r\nsandy hair and red whiskers, all trimmed alike, to a hair; rough grey\r\ncoats, very rosy, clean faces, and a fine, full way of speaking, which\r\nis particularly agreeable, after our slip-shod American gabble. The two\r\nladies wear funny velvet fur-trimmed hoods; are done up, like compact\r\nbundles, in tartan shawls; and look as if bent on seeing everything\r\nthoroughly. The devotion of one elderly John Bull to his red-nosed\r\nspouse was really beautiful to behold. She was plain and cross, and\r\nfussy and stupid, but J. B., Esq., read no papers when she was awake,\r\nturned no cold shoulder when she wished to sleep, and cheerfully said,\r\n\"Yes, me dear,\" to every wish or want the wife of his bosom expressed.\r\nI quite warmed to the excellent man, and asked a question or two, as\r\nthe only means of expressing my good will. He answered very civilly,\r\nbut evidently hadn't been used to being addressed by strange women in\r\npublic conveyances; and Mrs. B. fixed her green eyes upon me, as if she\r\nthought me a forward huzzy, or whatever is good English for a presuming\r\nyoung woman. The pair left their friends before we reached Washington;\r\nand the last I saw of them was a vision of a large plaid lady, stalking\r\ngrimly away, on the arm of a rosy, stout gentleman, loaded with rugs,\r\nbags, and books, but still devoted, still smiling, and waving a hearty\r\n\"Fare ye well! We'll meet ye at Willard's on Chusday.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after their departure we had an accident; for no long journey in\r\nAmerica would be complete without one. A coupling iron broke; and,\r\nafter leaving the last car behind us, we waited for it to come up,\r\nwhich it did, with a crash that knocked every one forward on their\r\nfaces, and caused several old ladies to screech dismally. Hats flew\r\noff, bonnets were flattened, the stove skipped, the lamps fell down,\r\nthe water jar turned a somersault, and the wheel just over which I sat\r\nreceived some damage. Of course, it became necessary for all the men to\r\nget out, and stand about in everybody's way, while repairs were made;\r\nand for the women to wrestle their heads out of the windows, asking\r\nninety-nine foolish questions to one sensible one. A few wise females\r\nseized this favorable moment to better their seats, well knowing that\r\nfew men can face the wooden stare with which they regard the former\r\npossessors of the places they have invaded.\r\n\r\nThe country through which we passed did not seem so very unlike that\r\nwhich I had left, except that it was more level and less wintry. In\r\nsummer time the wide fields would have shown me new sights, and the\r\nway-side hedges blossomed with new flowers; now, everything was sere\r\nand sodden, and a general air of shiftlessness prevailed, which would\r\nhave caused a New England farmer much disgust, and a strong desire to\r\n\"buckle to,\" and \"right up\" things. Dreary little houses, with chimneys\r\nbuilt outside, with clay and rough sticks piled crosswise, as we used\r\nto build cob towers, stood in barren looking fields, with cow, pig, or\r\nmule lounging about the door. We often passed colored people, looking\r\nas if they had come out of a picture book, or off the stage, but not at\r\nall the sort of people I'd been accustomed to see at the North.\r\n\r\nWay-side encampments made the fields and lanes gay with blue coats and\r\nthe glitter of buttons. Military washes flapped and fluttered on the\r\nfences; pots were steaming in the open air; all sorts of tableaux seen\r\nthrough the openings of tents, and everywhere the boys threw up their\r\ncaps and cut capers as we passed.\r\n\r\nWashington.--It was dark when we arrived; and, but for the presence of\r\nanother friendly gentleman, I should have yielded myself a helpless\r\nprey to the first overpowering hackman, who insisted that I wanted to\r\ngo just where I didn't. Putting me into the conveyance I belonged in,\r\nmy escort added to the obligation by pointing out the objects of\r\ninterest which we passed in our long drive. Though I'd often been told\r\nthat Washington was a spacious place, its visible magnitude quite took\r\nmy breath away, and of course I quoted Randolph's expression, \"a city\r\nof magnificent distances,\" as I suppose every one does when they see\r\nit. The Capitol was so like the pictures that hang opposite the staring\r\nFather of his Country, in boarding-houses and hotels, that it did not\r\nimpress me, except to recall the time when I was sure that Cinderella\r\nwent to housekeeping in just such a place, after she had married the\r\ninflammable Prince; though, even at that early period, I had my doubts\r\nas to the wisdom of a match whose foundation was of glass.\r\n\r\nThe White House was lighted up, and carriages were rolling in and out\r\nof the great gate. I stared hard at the famous East Room, and would\r\nhave liked a peep through the crack of the door. My old gentleman was\r\nindefatigable in his attentions, and I said, \"Splendid!\" to everything\r\nhe pointed out, though I suspect I often admired the wrong place, and\r\nmissed the right. Pennsylvania Avenue, with its bustle, lights, music,\r\nand military, made me feel as if I'd crossed the water and landed\r\nsomewhere in Carnival time. Coming to less noticeable parts of the\r\ncity, my companion fell silent, and I meditated upon the perfection\r\nwhich Art had attained in America--having just passed a bronze statue\r\nof some hero, who looked like a black Methodist minister, in a cocked\r\nhat, above the waist, and a tipsy squire below; while his horse stood\r\nlike an opera dancer, on one leg, in a high, but somewhat remarkable\r\nwind, which blew his mane one way and his massive tail the other.\r\n\r\n\"Hurly-burly House, ma'am!\" called a voice, startling me from my\r\nreverie, as we stopped before a great pile of buildings, with a flag\r\nflying before it, sentinels at the door, and a very trying quantity of\r\nmen lounging about. My heart beat rather faster than usual, and it\r\nsuddenly struck me that I was very far from home; but I descended with\r\ndignity, wondering whether I should be stopped for want of a\r\ncountersign, and forced to pass the night in the street. Marching\r\nboldly up the steps, I found that no form was necessary, for the men\r\nfell back, the guard touched their caps, a boy opened the door, and, as\r\nit closed behind me, I felt that I was fairly started, and Nurse\r\nPeriwinkle's Mission was begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA DAY.\r\n\r\n\"They've come! they've come! hurry up, ladies--you're wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who have come? the rebels?\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden summons in the gray dawn was somewhat startling to a three\r\ndays' nurse like myself, and, as the thundering knock came at our door,\r\nI sprang up in my bed, prepared\r\n\r\n    \"To gird my woman's form,\r\n     And on the ramparts die,\"\r\n\r\nif necessary; but my room-mate took it more coolly, and, as she began a\r\nrapid toilet, answered my bewildered question,--\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, no child; it's the wounded from Fredericksburg; forty\r\nambulances are at the door, and we shall have our hands full in fifteen\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we have to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wash, dress, feed, warm and nurse them for the next three months, I\r\ndare say. Eighty beds are ready, and we were getting impatient for the\r\nmen to come. Now you will begin to see hospital life in earnest, for\r\nyou won't probably find time to sit down all day, and may think\r\nyourself fortunate if you get to bed by midnight. Come to me in the\r\nball-room when you are ready; the worst cases are always carried there,\r\nand I shall need your help.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the energetic little woman twirled her hair into a button at\r\nthe back of her head, in a \"cleared for action\" sort of style, and\r\nvanished, wrestling her way into a feminine kind of pea-jacket as she\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nI am free to confess that I had a realizing sense of the fact that my\r\nhospital bed was not a bed of roses just then, or the prospect before\r\nme one of unmingled rapture. My three days' experiences had begun with\r\na death, and, owing to the defalcation of another nurse, a somewhat\r\nabrupt plunge into the superintendence of a ward containing forty beds,\r\nwhere I spent my shining hours washing faces, serving rations, giving\r\nmedicine, and sitting in a very hard chair, with pneumonia on one side,\r\ndiphtheria on the other, five typhoids on the opposite, and a dozen\r\ndilapidated patriots, hopping, lying, and lounging about, all staring\r\nmore or less at the new \"nuss,\" who suffered untold agonies, but\r\nconcealed them under as matronly an aspect as a spinster could assume,\r\nand blundered through her trying labors with a Spartan firmness, which\r\nI hope they appreciated, but am afraid they didn't. Having a taste for\r\n\"ghastliness,\" I had rather longed for the wounded to arrive, for\r\nrheumatism wasn't heroic, neither was liver complaint, or measles; even\r\nfever had lost its charms since \"bathing burning brows\" had been used\r\nup in romances, real and ideal; but when I peeped into the dusky street\r\nlined with what I at first had innocently called market carts, now\r\nunloading their sad freight at our door, I recalled sundry\r\nreminiscences I had heard from nurses of longer standing, my ardor\r\nexperienced a  sudden chill, and I indulged in a most unpatriotic wish\r\nthat I was safe at home again, with a quiet day before me, and no\r\nnecessity for being hustled up, as if I were a hen and had only to hop\r\noff my roost, give my plumage a peck, and be ready for action. A second\r\nbang at the door sent this recreant desire to the right about, as a\r\nlittle woolly head popped in, and Joey, (a six years' old contraband,)\r\nannounced--\r\n\r\n\"Miss Blank is jes' wild fer ye, and says fly round right away. They's\r\ncomin' in, I tell yer, heaps on 'em--one was took out dead, and I see\r\nhim,--ky! warn't he a goner!\"\r\n\r\nWith which cheerful intelligence the imp scuttled away, singing like a\r\nblackbird, and I followed, feeling that Richard was _not_ himself again,\r\nand wouldn't be for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I met was a regiment of the vilest odors that ever\r\nassaulted the human nose, and took it by storm. Cologne, with its seven\r\nand seventy evil savors, was a posy-bed to it; and the worst of this\r\naffliction was, every one had assured me that it was a chronic weakness\r\nof all hospitals, and I must bear it. I did, armed with lavender water,\r\nwith which I so besprinkled myself and premises, that, like my friend\r\nSairy, I was soon known among my patients as \"the nurse with the\r\nbottle.\" Having been run over by three excited surgeons, bumped against\r\nby migratory coal-hods, water-pails, and small boys, nearly scalded by\r\nan avalanche of newly-filled tea-pots, and hopelessly entangled in a\r\nknot of colored sisters coming to wash, I progressed by slow stages up\r\nstairs and down, till the main hall was reached, and I paused to take\r\nbreath and a survey. There they were! \"our brave boys,\" as the papers\r\njustly call them, for cowards could hardly have been so riddled with\r\nshot and shell, so torn and shattered, nor have borne suffering for\r\nwhich we have no name, with an uncomplaining fortitude, which made one\r\nglad to cherish each as a brother. In they came, some on stretchers,\r\nsome in men's arms, some feebly staggering along propped on rude\r\ncrutches, and one lay stark and still with covered face, as a comrade\r\ngave his name to be recorded before they carried him away to the dead\r\nhouse. All was hurry and confusion; the hall was full of these wrecks\r\nof humanity, for the most exhausted could not reach a bed till duly\r\nticketed and registered; the walls were lined with rows of such as\r\ncould sit, the floor covered with the more disabled, the steps and\r\ndoor-ways filled with helpers and lookers on; the sound of many feet and\r\nvoices made that usually quiet hour as noisy as noon; and, in the midst\r\nof it all, the matron's motherly face brought more comfort to many a\r\npoor soul, than the cordial draughts she administered, or the cheery\r\nwords that welcomed all, making of the hospital a home.\r\n\r\nThe sight of several stretchers, each with its legless, armless, or\r\ndesperately wounded occupant, entering my ward, admonished me that I\r\nwas there to work, not to wonder or weep; so I corked up my feelings,\r\nand returned to the path of duty, which was rather \"a hard road to\r\ntravel\" just then. The house had been a hotel before hospitals were\r\nneeded, and many of the doors still bore their old names; some not so\r\ninappropriate as might be imagined, for my ward was in truth a\r\n_ball-room,_ if gun-shot wounds could christen it. Forty beds were\r\nprepared, many already tenanted by tired men who fell down anywhere,\r\nand drowsed till the smell of food roused them. Round the great stove\r\nwas gathered the dreariest group I ever saw--ragged, gaunt and pale,\r\nmud to the knees, with bloody bandages untouched since put on days\r\nbefore; many bundled up in blankets, coats being lost or useless; and\r\nall wearing that disheartened look which proclaimed defeat,  more\r\nplainly than any telegram of the Burnside blunder. I pitied them so\r\nmuch, I dared not speak to them, though, remembering all they had been\r\nthrough since the rout at Fredericksburg, I yearned to serve the\r\ndreariest of them all. Presently, Miss Blank tore me from my refuge\r\nbehind piles of one-sleeved shirts, odd socks, bandages and lint; put\r\nbasin, sponge, towels, and a block of brown soap into my hands, with\r\nthese appalling directions:\r\n\r\n\"Come, my dear, begin to wash as fast as you can. Tell them to take off\r\nsocks, coats and shirts, scrub them well, put on clean shirts, and the\r\nattendants will finish them off, and lay them in bed.\"\r\n\r\nIf she had requested me to shave them all, or dance a hornpipe on the\r\nstove funnel, I should have been less staggered; but to scrub some\r\ndozen lords of creation at a moment's notice, was really--really----.\r\nHowever, there was no time for nonsense, and, having resolved when I\r\ncame to do everything I was bid, I drowned my scruples in my wash-bowl,\r\nclutched my soap manfully, and, assuming a business-like air, made a\r\ndab at the first dirty specimen I saw, bent on performing my task vi et\r\narmis if necessary. I chanced to light on a withered old Irishman,\r\nwounded in the head, which caused that portion of his frame to be\r\ntastefully laid out like a garden, the bandages being the walks, his\r\nhair the shrubbery. He was so overpowered by the honor of having a lady\r\nwash him, as he expressed it, that he did nothing but roll up his eyes,\r\nand bless me, in an irresistible style which was too much for my sense\r\nof the ludicrous; so we laughed together, and when I knelt down to take\r\noff his shoes, he \"flopped\" also and wouldn't hear of my touching\r\n\"them dirty craters. May your bed above be aisy darlin', for the day's\r\nwork ye ar doon!--Whoosh! there ye are, and bedad, it's hard tellin'\r\nwhich is the dirtiest, the fut or the shoe.\" It was; and if he hadn't\r\nbeen to the fore, I should have gone on pulling, under the impression\r\nthat the \"fut\" was a boot, for trousers, socks, shoes and legs were a\r\nmass of mud. This comical tableau produced a general grin, at which\r\npropitious beginning I took heart and scrubbed away like any tidy\r\nparent on a Saturday night. Some of them took the performance like\r\nsleepy children, leaning their tired heads against me as I worked,\r\nothers looked grimly scandalized, and several of the roughest colored\r\nlike bashful girls. One wore a soiled little bag about his neck, and,\r\nas I moved it, to bathe his wounded breast, I said,\r\n\r\n\"Your talisman didn't save you, did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I reckon it did, marm, for that shot would a gone a couple a\r\ninches deeper but for my old mammy's camphor bag,\" answered the\r\ncheerful philosopher.\r\n\r\nAnother, with a gun-shot wound through the cheek, asked for a\r\nlooking-glass, and when I brought one, regarded his swollen face with a\r\ndolorous expression, as he muttered--\r\n\r\n\"I vow to gosh, that's too bad! I warn't a bad looking chap before, and\r\nnow I'm done for; won't there be a thunderin' scar? and what on earth\r\nwill Josephine Skinner say?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up at me with his one eye so appealingly, that I controlled\r\nmy risibles, and assured him that if Josephine was a girl of sense, she\r\nwould admire the honorable scar, as a lasting proof that he had faced\r\nthe enemy, for all women thought a wound the best decoration a brave\r\nsoldier could wear. I hope Miss Skinner verified the good opinion I so\r\nrashly expressed of her, but I shall never know.\r\n\r\nThe next scrubbee was a nice looking lad, with a curly brown mane, and\r\na budding trace of gingerbread over the lip, which he called his beard,\r\nand defended stoutly, when the barber jocosely suggested its\r\nimmolation. He lay on a bed,  with one leg gone, and the right arm so\r\nshattered that it must evidently follow; yet the little Sergeant was as\r\nmerry as if his afflictions were not worth lamenting over, and when a\r\ndrop or two of salt water mingled with my suds at the sight of this\r\nstrong young body, so marred and maimed, the boy looked up, with a\r\nbrave smile, though there was a little quiver of the lips, as he said,\r\n\r\n\"Now don't you fret yourself about me, miss; I'm first rate here, for\r\nit's nuts to lie still on this bed, after knocking about in those\r\nconfounded ambulances, that shake what there is left of a fellow to\r\njelly. I never was in one of these places before, and think this\r\ncleaning up a jolly thing for us, though I'm afraid it isn't for you\r\nladies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this your first battle, Sergeant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, miss; I've been in six scrimmages, and never got a scratch till\r\nthis last one; but it's done the business pretty thoroughly for me, I\r\nshould say. Lord! what a scramble there'll be for arms and legs, when\r\nwe old boys come out of our graves, on the Judgment Day: wonder if we\r\nshall get our own again? If we do, my leg will have to tramp from\r\nFredericksburg, my arm from here, I suppose, and meet my body, wherever\r\nit may be.\"\r\n\r\nThe fancy seemed to tickle him mightily, for he laughed blithely, and\r\nso did I; which, no doubt, caused the new nurse to be regarded as a\r\nlight-minded sinner by the Chaplain, who roamed vaguely about,\r\ninforming the men that they were all worms, corrupt of heart, with\r\nperishable bodies, and souls only to be saved by a diligent perusal of\r\ncertain tracts, and other equally cheering bits of spiritual\r\nconsolation, when spirituous ditto would have been preferred.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mrs.!\" called a voice behind me; and, turning, I saw a rough\r\nMichigander, with an arm blown off at the shoulder, and two or three\r\nbullets still in him--as he afterwards mentioned, as carelessly as if\r\ngentlemen were in the habit of carrying such trifles about with them. I\r\nwent to him, and, while administering a dose of soap and water, he\r\nwhispered, irefully:\r\n\r\n\"That red-headed devil, over yonder, is a reb, damn him! You'll agree\r\nto that, I'll bet? He's got shet of a foot, or he'd a cut like the rest\r\nof the lot. Don't you wash him, nor feed him, but jest let him holler\r\ntill he's tired. It's a blasted shame to fetch them fellers in here,\r\nalong side of us; and so I'll tell the chap that bosses this concern;\r\ncuss me if I don't.\"\r\n\r\nI regret to say that I did not deliver a moral sermon upon the duty of\r\nforgiving our enemies, and the sin of profanity, then and there; but,\r\nbeing a red-hot Abolitionist, stared fixedly at the tall rebel, who was\r\na copperhead, in every sense of the word, and privately resolved to put\r\nsoap in his eyes, rub his nose the wrong way, and excoriate his cuticle\r\ngenerally, if I had the washing of him.\r\n\r\nMy amiable intentions, however, were frustrated; for, when I\r\napproached, with as Christian an expression as my principles would\r\nallow, and asked the question--\"Shall I try to make you more\r\ncomfortable, sir?\" all I got for my pains was a gruff--\r\n\r\n\"No; I'll do it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here's your Southern chivalry, with a witness,\" thought I, dumping the\r\nbasin down before him, thereby quenching a strong desire to give him a\r\nsummary baptism, in return for his ungraciousness; for my angry\r\npassions rose, at this rebuff, in a way that would have scandalized\r\ngood Dr. Watts. He was a disappointment in all respects, (the rebel,\r\nnot the blessed Doctor,) for he was neither fiendish, romantic,\r\npathetic, or anything interesting; but a long, fat man, with a head\r\nlike a burning bush, and a perfectly expressionless face: so I could\r\nhate him without the slightest drawback, and ignored his existence\r\nfrom that day forth. One redeeming trait he certainly did possess, as\r\nthe floor speedily testified; for his ablutions were so vigorously\r\nperformed, that his bed soon stood like an isolated island, in a sea of\r\nsoap-suds, and he resembled a dripping merman, suffering from the loss\r\nof a fin. If cleanliness is a near neighbor to godliness, then was the\r\nbig rebel the godliest man in my ward that day.\r\n\r\nHaving done up our human wash, and laid it out to dry, the second\r\nsyllable of our version of the word war-fare was enacted with much\r\nsuccess. Great trays of bread, meat, soup and coffee appeared; and both\r\nnurses and attendants turned waiters, serving bountiful rations to all\r\nwho could eat. I can call my pinafore to testify to my good will in the\r\nwork, for in ten minutes it was reduced to a perambulating bill of\r\nfare, presenting samples of all the refreshments going or gone. It was\r\na lively scene; the long room lined with rows of beds, each filled by\r\nan occupant, whom water, shears, and clean raiment, had transformed\r\nfrom a dismal ragamuffin into a recumbent hero, with a cropped head. To\r\nand fro rushed matrons, maids, and convalescent \"boys,\" skirmishing\r\nwith knives and forks; retreating with empty plates; marching and\r\ncounter-marching, with unvaried success, while the clash of busy spoons\r\nmade most inspiring music for the charge of our Light Brigade:\r\n\r\n   \"Beds to the front of them,\r\n    Beds to the right of them,\r\n    Beds to the left of them,\r\n       Nobody blundered.\r\n    Beamed at by hungry souls,\r\n    Screamed at with brimming bowls,\r\n    Steamed at by army rolls,\r\n       Buttered and sundered.\r\n    With coffee not cannon plied,\r\n    Each must be satisfied,\r\n    Whether they lived or died;\r\n       All the men wondered.\"\r\n\r\nVery welcome seemed the generous meal, after a week of suffering,\r\nexposure, and short commons; soon the brown faces began to smile, as\r\nfood, warmth, and rest, did their pleasant work; and the grateful\r\n\"Thankee's\" were followed by more graphic accounts of the battle and\r\nretreat, than any paid reporter could have given us. Curious contrasts\r\nof the tragic and comic met one everywhere; and some touching as well\r\nas ludicrous episodes, might have been recorded that day. A six foot\r\nNew Hampshire man, with a leg broken and perforated by a piece of\r\nshell, so large that, had I not seen the wound, I should have regarded\r\nthe story as a Munchausenism, beckoned me to come and help him, as he\r\ncould not sit up, and both his bed and beard were getting plentifully\r\nanointed with soup. As I fed my big nestling with corresponding\r\nmouthfuls, I asked him how he felt during the battle.\r\n\r\n\"Well, 'twas my fust, you see, so I aint ashamed to say I was a trifle\r\nflustered in the beginnin', there was such an allfired racket; for ef\r\nthere's anything I do spleen agin, it's noise. But when my mate, Eph\r\nSylvester, caved, with a bullet through his head, I got mad, and\r\npitched in, licketty cut. Our part of the fight didn't last long; so a\r\nlot of us larked round Fredericksburg, and give some of them houses a\r\npretty consid'able of a rummage, till we was ordered out of the mess.\r\nSome of our fellows cut like time; but I warn't a-goin' to run for\r\nnobody; and, fust thing I knew, a shell bust, right in front of us, and\r\nI keeled over, feelin' as if I was blowed higher'n a kite. I sung out,\r\nand the boys come back for me, double quick; but the way they chucked\r\nme over them fences was a caution, I tell you. Next day I was most as\r\nblack as that darkey yonder, lickin' plates on the sly. This is bully\r\ncoffee, ain't it? Give us another pull at it, and I'll be obleeged to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI did; and, as the last gulp subsided, he said, with a rub of his old\r\nhandkerchief over eyes as well as mouth:\r\n\r\n\"Look a here; I've got a pair a earbobs and a handkercher pin I'm a\r\ngoin' to give you, if you'll have them; for you're the very moral o'\r\nLizy Sylvester, poor Eph's wife: that's why I signalled you to come\r\nover here. They aint much, I guess, but they'll do to memorize the rebs\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\nBurrowing under his pillow, he produced a little bundle of what he\r\ncalled \"truck,\" and gallantly presented me with a pair of earrings,\r\neach representing a cluster of corpulent grapes, and the pin a basket\r\nof astonishing fruit, the whole large and coppery enough for a small\r\nwarming-pan. Feeling delicate about depriving him of such valuable\r\nrelics, I accepted the earrings alone, and was obliged to depart,\r\nsomewhat abruptly, when my friend stuck the warming-pan in the bosom of\r\nhis night-gown, viewing it with much complacency, and, perhaps, some\r\ntender memory, in that rough heart of his, for the comrade he had lost.\r\n\r\nObserving that the man next him had left his meal untouched, I offered\r\nthe same service I had performed for his neighbor, but he shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am; I don't think I'll ever eat again, for I'm shot in\r\nthe stomach. But I'd like a drink of water, if you aint too busy.\"\r\n\r\nI rushed away, but the water-pails were gone to be refilled, and it was\r\nsome time before they reappeared. I did not forget my patient patient,\r\nmeanwhile, and, with the first mugful, hurried back to him. He seemed\r\nasleep; but something in the tired white face caused me to listen at\r\nhis lips for a breath. None came. I touched his forehead; it was cold:\r\nand then I knew that, while he waited, a better nurse than I had given\r\nhim a cooler draught, and healed him with a touch. I laid the sheet\r\nover the quiet sleeper, whom no noise could now disturb; and, half an\r\nhour later, the bed was empty. It seemed a poor requital for all he had\r\nsacrificed and suffered,--that hospital bed, lonely even in a crowd;\r\nfor there was no familiar face for him to look his last upon; no\r\nfriendly voice to say, Good bye; no hand to lead him gently down into\r\nthe Valley of the Shadow; and he vanished, like a drop in that red sea\r\nupon whose shores so many women stand lamenting. For a moment I felt\r\nbitterly indignant at this seeming carelessness of the value of life,\r\nthe sanctity of death; then consoled myself with the thought that, when\r\nthe great muster roll was called, these nameless men might be promoted\r\nabove many whose tall monuments record the barren honors they have won.\r\n\r\nAll having eaten, drank, and rested, the surgeons began their rounds;\r\nand I took my first lesson in the art of dressing wounds. It wasn't a\r\nfestive scene, by any means; for Dr. P., whose Aid I constituted myself,\r\nfell to work with a vigor which soon convinced me that I was a weaker\r\nvessel, though nothing would have induced me to confess it then. He had\r\nserved in the Crimea, and seemed to regard a dilapidated body very much\r\nas I should have regarded a damaged garment; and, turning up his cuffs,\r\nwhipped out a very unpleasant looking housewife, cutting, sawing,\r\npatching and piecing, with the enthusiasm of an accomplished surgical\r\nseamstress; explaining the process, in scientific terms, to the\r\npatient, meantime; which, of course, was immensely cheering and\r\ncomfortable. There was an uncanny sort of fascination in watching him,\r\nas he peered and probed into the mechanism of those wonderful bodies,\r\nwhose mysteries he understood so well. The more intricate the wound,\r\nthe better he liked it. A poor private, with both legs off, and shot\r\nthrough the lungs, possessed more attractions for him than a dozen\r\ngenerals, slightly scratched in some \"masterly retreat;\" and had any\r\none appeared in small pieces, requesting to be put together again, he\r\nwould have considered it a special dispensation.\r\n\r\nThe amputations were reserved till the morrow, and the merciful magic\r\nof ether was not thought necessary that day, so the poor souls had to\r\nbear their pains as best they might. It is all very well to talk of the\r\npatience of woman; and far be it from me to pluck that feather from her\r\ncap, for, heaven knows, she isn't allowed to wear many; but the patient\r\nendurance of these men, under trials of the flesh, was truly wonderful;\r\ntheir fortitude seemed contagious, and scarcely a cry escaped them,\r\nthough I often longed to groan for them, when pride kept their white\r\nlips shut, while great drops stood upon their foreheads, and the bed\r\nshook with the irrepressible tremor of their tortured bodies. One or\r\ntwo Irishmen anathematized the doctors with the frankness of their\r\nnation, and ordered the Virgin to stand by them, as if she had been the\r\nwedded Biddy to whom they could administer the poker, if she didn't;\r\nbut, as a general thing, the work went on in silence, broken only by\r\nsome quiet request for roller, instruments, or plaster, a sigh from the\r\npatient, or a sympathizing murmur from the nurse.\r\n\r\nIt was long past noon before these repairs were even partially made;\r\nand, having got the bodies of my boys into something like order, the\r\nnext task was to minister to their minds, by writing letters to the\r\nanxious souls at home; answering questions, reading papers, taking\r\npossession of money and valuables; for the eighth commandment was\r\nreduced to a very fragmentary condition, both by the blacks and whites,\r\nwho ornamented our hospital with their presence. Pocket books, purses,\r\nminiatures, and watches, were sealed up, labelled, and handed over to\r\nthe matron, till such times as the owners thereof were ready to depart\r\nhomeward or campward again. The letters dictated to me, and revised by\r\nme, that afternoon, would have made an excellent chapter for some\r\nfuture history of the war; for, like that which Thackeray's \"Ensign\r\nSpooney\" wrote his mother just before Waterloo, they were \"full of\r\naffection, pluck, and bad spelling;\" nearly all giving lively accounts\r\nof the battle, and ending with a somewhat sudden plunge from patriotism\r\nto provender, desiring \"Marm,\" \"Mary Ann,\" or \"Aunt Peters,\" to send\r\nalong some pies, pickles, sweet stuff, and apples, \"to yourn in haste,\"\r\nJoe, Sam, or Ned, as the case might be.\r\n\r\nMy little Sergeant insisted on trying to scribble something with his\r\nleft hand, and patiently accomplished some half dozen lines of\r\nhieroglyphics, which he gave me to fold and direct, with a boyish\r\nblush, that rendered a glimpse of \"My Dearest Jane,\" unnecessary, to\r\nassure me that the heroic lad had been more successful in the service\r\nof Commander-in-Chief Cupid than that of Gen. Mars; and a charming\r\nlittle romance blossomed instanter in Nurse Periwinkle's romantic\r\nfancy, though no further confidences were made that day, for Sergeant\r\nfell asleep, and, judging from his tranquil face, visited his absent\r\nsweetheart in the pleasant land of dreams.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock a great bell rang, and the attendants flew, not to\r\narms, but to their trays, to bring up supper, when a second uproar\r\nannounced that it was ready. The new comers woke at the sound; and I\r\npresently discovered that it took a very bad wound to incapacitate the\r\ndefenders of the faith for the consumption of their rations; the amount\r\nthat some of them sequestered was amazing; but when I suggested the\r\nprobability of a famine hereafter, to the matron, that motherly lady\r\ncried out: \"Bless their hearts, why shouldn't they eat? It's their only\r\namusement; so fill every one, and, if there's not enough ready\r\nto-night, I'll lend my share to the Lord by giving it to the boys.\"\r\nAnd, whipping up her coffee-pot and plate of toast, she gladdened the\r\neyes and stomachs of two or three dissatisfied heroes, by serving them\r\nwith a liberal hand; and I haven't the slightest doubt that, having\r\ncast her bread upon the waters, it came back buttered, as another\r\nlarge-hearted old lady was wont to say.\r\n\r\nThen came the doctor's evening visit; the administration of medicines;\r\nwashing feverish faces; smoothing tumbled beds; wetting wounds; singing\r\nlullabies; and preparations for the night. By eleven, the last labor of\r\nlove was done; the last \"good night\" spoken; and, if any needed a\r\nreward for that day's work, they surely received it, in the silent\r\neloquence of those long lines of faces, showing pale and peaceful in\r\nthe shaded rooms, as we quitted them, followed by grateful glances that\r\nlighted us to bed, where rest, the sweetest, made our pillows soft,\r\nwhile Night and Nature took our places, filling that great house of\r\npain with the healing miracles of Sleep, and his diviner brother, Death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA NIGHT.\r\n\r\nBeing fond of the night side of nature, I was soon promoted to the post\r\nof night nurse, with every facility for indulging in my favorite\r\npastime of \"owling.\" My colleague, a black-eyed widow, relieved me at\r\ndawn, we two taking care of the ward, between us, like the immortal\r\nSairy and Betsey, \"turn and turn about.\" I usually found my boys in the\r\njolliest state of mind their condition allowed; for it was a known fact\r\nthat Nurse Periwinkle objected to blue devils, and entertained a belief\r\nthat he who laughed most was surest of recovery. At the beginning of my\r\nreign, dumps and dismals prevailed; the nurses looked anxious and\r\ntired, the men gloomy or sad; and a general\r\n\"Hark!-from-the-tombs-a-doleful-sound\" style of conversation seemed to\r\nbe the fashion: a state of things which caused one coming from a merry,\r\nsocial New England town, to feel as if she had got into an exhausted\r\nreceiver; and the instinct of self-preservation, to say nothing of a\r\nphilanthropic desire to serve the race, caused a speedy change in Ward\r\nNo. 1.\r\n\r\nMore flattering than the most gracefully turned compliment, more\r\ngrateful than the most admiring glance, was the sight of those rows of\r\nfaces, all strange to me a little while ago, now lighting up, with\r\nsmiles of welcome, as I came among them, enjoying that moment heartily,\r\nwith a womanly pride in their regard, a motherly affection for them\r\nall. The evenings were spent in reading aloud, writing letters, waiting\r\non and amusing the men, going the rounds with Dr. P., as he made his\r\nsecond daily survey, dressing my dozen wounds afresh, giving last\r\ndoses, and making them cozy for the long hours to come, till the nine\r\no'clock bell rang, the gas was turned down, the day nurses went off\r\nduty, the night watch came on, and my nocturnal adventure began.\r\n\r\nMy ward was now divided into three rooms; and, under favor of the\r\nmatron, I had managed to sort out the patients in such a way that I had\r\nwhat I called, \"my duty room,\" my \"pleasure room,\" and my \"pathetic\r\nroom,\" and worked for each in a different way. One, I visited, armed\r\nwith a dressing tray, full of rollers, plasters, and pins; another,\r\nwith books, flowers, games, and gossip; a third, with teapots,\r\nlullabies, consolation, and sometimes, a shroud.\r\n\r\nWherever the sickest or most helpless man chanced to be, there I held\r\nmy watch, often visiting the other rooms, to see that the general\r\nwatchman of the ward did his duty by the fires and the wounds, the\r\nlatter needing constant wetting. Not only on this account did I\r\nmeander, but also to get fresher air than the close rooms afforded;\r\nfor, owing to the stupidity of that mysterious \"somebody\" who does all\r\nthe damage in the world, the windows had been carefully nailed down\r\nabove, and the lower sashes could only be raised in the mildest\r\nweather, for the men lay just below. I had suggested a summary smashing\r\nof a few panes here and there, when frequent appeals to headquarters\r\nhad proved unavailing, and daily orders to lazy attendants had come to\r\nnothing. No one seconded the motion, however, and the nails were far\r\nbeyond my reach; for, though belonging to the sisterhood of\r\n\"ministering angels,\" I had no wings, and might as well have asked for\r\nJacob's ladder, as a pair of steps, in that charitable chaos.\r\n\r\nOne of the harmless ghosts who bore me company during the haunted\r\nhours, was Dan, the watchman, whom I regarded with a certain awe; for,\r\nthough so much together, I never fairly saw his face, and, but for his\r\nlegs, should never have recognized him, as we seldom met by day. These\r\nlegs were remarkable, as was his whole figure, for his body was short,\r\nrotund, and done up in a big jacket, and muffler; his beard hid the\r\nlower part of his face, his hat-brim the upper; and all I ever\r\ndiscovered was a pair of sleepy eyes, and a very mild voice. But the\r\nlegs!--very long, very thin, very crooked and feeble, looking like grey\r\nsausages in their tight coverings, without a ray of pegtopishness about\r\nthem, and finished off with a pair of expansive, green cloth shoes,\r\nvery like Chinese junks, with the sails down. This figure, gliding\r\nnoiselessly about the dimly lighted rooms, was strongly suggestive of\r\nthe spirit of a beer barrel mounted on cork-screws, haunting the old\r\nhotel in search of its lost mates, emptied and staved in long ago.\r\n\r\nAnother goblin who frequently appeared to me, was the attendant of the\r\npathetic room, who, being a faithful soul, was often up to tend two or\r\nthree men, weak and wandering as babies, after the fever had gone. The\r\namiable creature beguiled the watches of the night by brewing jorums of\r\na fearful beverage, which he called coffee, and insisted on sharing\r\nwith me; coming in with a great bowl of something like mud soup,\r\nscalding hot, guiltless of cream, rich in an all-pervading flavor of\r\nmolasses, scorch and tin pot. Such an amount of good will and\r\nneighborly kindness also went into the mess, that I never could find\r\nthe heart to refuse, but always received it with thanks, sipped it with\r\nhypocritical relish while he remained, and whipped it into the slop-jar\r\nthe instant he departed, thereby gratifying him, securing one rousing\r\nlaugh in the doziest hour of the night, and no one was the worse for\r\nthe transaction but the pigs. Whether they were \"cut off untimely in\r\ntheir sins,\" or not, I carefully abstained from inquiring.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange life--asleep half the day, exploring Washington the\r\nother half, and all night hovering, like a massive cherubim, in a red\r\nrigolette, over the slumbering sons of man. I liked it, and found many\r\nthings to amuse, instruct, and interest me. The snores alone were quite\r\na study, varying from the mild sniff to the stentorian snort, which\r\nstartled the echoes and hoisted the performer erect to accuse his\r\nneighbor of the deed, magnanimously forgive him, and wrapping the\r\ndrapery of his couch about him, lie down to vocal slumber. After\r\nlistening for a week to this band of wind instruments, I indulged in\r\nthe belief that I could recognize each by the snore alone, and was\r\ntempted to join the chorus by breaking out with John Brown's favorite\r\nhymn:\r\n\r\n\"Blow ye the trumpet, blow!\"\r\n\r\nI would have given much to have possessed the art of sketching, for\r\nmany of the faces became wonderfully interesting when unconscious. Some\r\ngrew stern and grim, the men evidently dreaming of war, as they gave\r\norders, groaned over their wounds, or damned the rebels vigorously;\r\nsome grew sad and infinitely pathetic, as if the pain borne silently\r\nall day, revenged itself by now betraying what the man's pride had\r\nconcealed so well. Often the roughest grew young and pleasant when\r\nsleep smoothed the hard lines away, letting the real nature assert\r\nitself; many almost seemed to speak, and I learned to know these men\r\nbetter by night than through any intercourse by day. Sometimes they\r\ndisappointed me, for faces that looked merry and good in the light,\r\ngrew bad and sly when the shadows came; and though they made no\r\nconfidences in words, I read their lives, leaving them to wonder at the\r\nchange of manner this midnight magic wrought in their nurse. A few\r\ntalked busily; one drummer boy sang sweetly, though no persuasions\r\ncould win a note from him by day; and several depended on being told\r\nwhat they had talked of in the morning. Even my constitutionals in the\r\nchilly halls, possessed a certain charm, for the house was never still.\r\nSentinels tramped round it all night long, their muskets glittering in\r\nthe wintry moonlight as they walked, or stood before the doors,\r\nstraight and silent, as figures of stone, causing one to conjure up\r\nromantic visions of guarded forts, sudden surprises, and daring deeds;\r\nfor in these war times the hum drum life of Yankeedom had vanished, and\r\nthe most prosaic feel some thrill of that excitement which stirs the\r\nnation's heart, and makes its capital a camp of hospitals. Wandering up\r\nand down these lower halls, I often heard cries from above, steps\r\nhurrying to and fro, saw surgeons passing up, or men coming down\r\ncarrying a stretcher, where lay a long white figure, whose face was\r\nshrouded and whose fight was done. Sometimes I stopped to watch the\r\npassers in the street, the moonlight shining on the spire opposite, or\r\nthe gleam of some vessel floating, like a white-winged sea-gull, down\r\nthe broad Potomac, whose fullest flow can never wash away the red stain\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nThe night whose events I have a fancy to record, opened with a little\r\ncomedy, and closed with a great tragedy; for a virtuous and useful life\r\nuntimely ended is always tragical to those who see not as God sees. My\r\nheadquarters were beside the bed of a New Jersey boy, crazed by the\r\nhorrors of that dreadful Saturday. A slight wound in the knee brought\r\nhim there; but his mind had suffered more than his body; some string of\r\nthat delicate machine was over strained, and, for days, he had been\r\nreliving, in imagination, the scenes he could not forget, till his\r\ndistress broke out in incoherent ravings, pitiful to hear. As I sat by\r\nhim, endeavoring to soothe his poor distracted brain by the constant\r\ntouch of wet hands over his hot forehead, he lay cheering his comrades\r\non, hurrying them back, then counting them as they fell around him,\r\noften clutching my arm, to drag me from the vicinity of a bursting\r\nshell, or covering up his head to screen himself from a shower of shot;\r\nhis face brilliant with fever; his eyes restless; his head never still;\r\nevery muscle strained and rigid; while an incessant stream of defiant\r\nshouts, whispered warnings, and broken laments, poured from his lips\r\nwith that forceful bewilderment which makes such wanderings so hard to\r\noverhear.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven, and my patient was slowly wearying himself into\r\nfitful intervals of quietude, when, in one of these pauses, a curious\r\nsound arrested my attention. Looking over my shoulder, I saw a\r\none-legged phantom hopping nimbly down the room; and, going to meet it,\r\nrecognized a certain Pennsylvania gentleman, whose wound-fever had\r\ntaken a turn for the worse, and, depriving him of the few wits a\r\ndrunken campaign had left him, set him literally tripping on the light,\r\nfantastic toe \"toward home,\" as he blandly informed me, touching the\r\nmilitary cap which formed a striking contrast to the severe simplicity\r\nof the rest of his decidedly _undress_ uniform. When sane, the least\r\nmovement produced a roar of pain or a volley of oaths; but the\r\ndeparture of reason seemed to have wrought an agreeable change, both in\r\nthe man and his manners; for, balancing himself on one leg, like a\r\nmeditative stork, he plunged into an animated discussion of the war,\r\nthe President, lager beer, and Enfield rifles, regardless of any\r\nsuggestions of mine as to the propriety of returning to bed, lest he be\r\ncourt-martialed for desertion.\r\n\r\nAnything more supremely ridiculous can hardly be imagined than this\r\nfigure, scantily draped in white, its one foot covered with a big blue\r\nsock, a dingy cap set rakingly askew on its shaven head, and placid\r\nsatisfaction beaming in its broad red face, as it flourished a mug in\r\none hand, an old boot in the other, calling them canteen and knapsack,\r\nwhile it skipped and fluttered in the most unearthly fashion. What to\r\ndo with the creature I didn't know; Dan was absent, and if I went to\r\nfind him, the perambulator might festoon himself out of the window, set\r\nhis toga on fire, or do some of his neighbors a mischief. The attendant\r\nof the room was sleeping like a near relative of the celebrated Seven,\r\nand nothing short of pins would rouse him; for he had been out that\r\nday, and whiskey asserted its supremacy in balmy whiffs. Still\r\ndeclaiming, in a fine flow of eloquence, the demented gentleman hopped\r\non, blind and deaf to my graspings and entreaties; and I was about to\r\nslam the door in his face, and run for help, when a second and saner\r\nphantom, \"all in white,\" came to the rescue, in the likeness of a big\r\nPrussian, who spoke no English, but divined the crisis, and put an end\r\nto it, by bundling the lively monoped into his bed, like a baby, with\r\nan authoritative command to \"stay put,\" which received added weight\r\nfrom being delivered in an odd conglomeration of French and German,\r\naccompanied by warning wags of a head decorated with a yellow cotton\r\nnight cap, rendered most imposing by a tassel like a bell-pull. Rather\r\nexhausted by his excursion, the member from Pennsylvania subsided; and,\r\nafter an irrepressible laugh together, my Prussian ally and myself were\r\nreturning to our places, when the echo of a sob caused us to glance\r\nalong the beds. It came from one in the corner--such a little bed!--and\r\nsuch a tearful little face looked up at us, as we stopped beside it!\r\nThe twelve years old drummer boy was not singing now, but sobbing, with\r\na manly effort all the while to stifle the distressful sounds that\r\nwould break out.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Teddy?\" I asked, as he rubbed the tears away, and checked\r\nhimself in the middle of a great sob to answer plaintively:\r\n\r\n\"I've got a chill, ma'am, but I ain't cryin' for that, 'cause I'm used\r\nto it. I dreamed Kit was here, and when I waked up he wasn't, and I\r\ncouldn't help it, then.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy came in with the rest, and the man who was taken dead from the\r\nambulance was the Kit he mourned. Well he might; for, when the wounded\r\nwere brought from Fredericksburg, the child lay in one of the camps\r\nthereabout, and this good friend, though sorely hurt himself, would not\r\nleave him to the exposure and neglect of such a time and place; but,\r\nwrapping him in his own blanket, carried him in his arms to the\r\ntransport, tended him during the passage, and only yielded up his\r\ncharge when Death met him at the door of the hospital which promised\r\ncare and comfort for the boy. For ten days, Teddy had shivered or\r\nburned with fever and ague, pining the while for Kit, and refusing to\r\nbe comforted, because he had not been able to thank him for the\r\ngenerous protection, which, perhaps, had cost the giver's life. The\r\nvivid dream had wrung the childish heart with a fresh pang, and when I\r\ntried the solace fitted for his years, the remorseful fear that haunted\r\nhim found vent in a fresh burst of tears, as he looked at the wasted\r\nhands I was endeavoring to warm:\r\n\r\n\"Oh! if I'd only been as thin when Kit carried me as I am now, maybe he\r\nwouldn't have died; but I was heavy, he was hurt worser than we knew,\r\nand so it killed him; and I didn't see him, to say good bye.\"\r\n\r\nThis thought had troubled him in secret; and my assurances that his\r\nfriend would probably have died at all events, hardly assuaged the\r\nbitterness of his regretful grief.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the delirious man began to shout; the one-legged rose\r\nup in his bed, as if preparing for another dart; Teddy bewailed himself\r\nmore piteously than before: and if ever a woman was at her wit's end,\r\nthat distracted female was Nurse Periwinkle, during the space of two or\r\nthree minutes, as she vibrated between the three beds, like an agitated\r\npendulum. Like a most opportune reinforcement, Dan, the bandy,\r\nappeared, and devoted himself to the lively party, leaving me free to\r\nreturn to my post; for the Prussian, with a nod and a smile, took the\r\nlad away to his own bed, and lulled him to sleep with a soothing\r\nmurmur, like a mammoth humble bee. I liked that in Fritz, and if he\r\never wondered afterward at the dainties which sometimes found their way\r\ninto his rations, or the extra comforts of his bed, he might have found\r\na solution of the mystery in sundry persons' knowledge of the fatherly\r\naction of that night.\r\n\r\nHardly was I settled again, when the inevitable bowl appeared, and its\r\nbearer delivered a message I had expected, yet dreaded to receive:\r\n\r\n\"John is going, ma'am, and wants to see you, if you can come.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moment this boy is asleep; tell him so, and let me know if I am in\r\ndanger of being too late.\"\r\n\r\nMy Ganymede departed, and while I quieted poor Shaw, I thought of John.\r\nHe came in a day or two after the others; and, one evening, when I\r\nentered my \"pathetic room,\" I found a lately emptied bed occupied by a\r\nlarge, fair man, with a fine face, and the serenest eyes I ever met.\r\nOne of the earlier comers had often spoken of a friend, who had\r\nremained behind, that those apparently worse wounded than himself might\r\nreach a shelter first. It seemed a David and Jonathan sort of\r\nfriendship. The man fretted for his mate, and was never tired of\r\npraising John--his courage, sobriety, self-denial, and unfailing\r\nkindliness of heart; always winding up with: \"He's an out an' out fine\r\nfeller, ma'am; you see if he aint.\"\r\n\r\nI had some curiosity to behold this piece of excellence, and when he\r\ncame, watched him for a night or two, before I made friends with him;\r\nfor, to tell the truth, I was a little afraid of the stately looking\r\nman, whose bed had to be lengthened to accommodate his commanding\r\nstature; who seldom spoke, uttered no complaint, asked no sympathy, but\r\ntranquilly observed what went on about him; and, as he lay high upon\r\nhis pillows, no picture of dying statesman or warrior was ever fuller of\r\nreal dignity than this Virginia blacksmith. A most attractive face he\r\nhad, framed in brown hair and beard, comely featured and full of vigor,\r\nas yet unsubdued by pain; thoughtful and often beautifully mild while\r\nwatching the afflictions of others, as if entirely forgetful of his\r\nown. His mouth was grave and firm, with plenty of will and courage in\r\nits lines, but a smile could make it as sweet as any woman's; and his\r\neyes were child's eyes, looking one fairly in the face, with a clear,\r\nstraightforward glance, which promised well for such as placed their\r\nfaith in him. He seemed to cling to life, as if it were rich in duties\r\nand delights, and he had learned the secret of content. The only time I\r\nsaw his composure disturbed, was when my surgeon brought another to\r\nexamine John, who scrutinized their faces with an anxious look, asking\r\nof the elder: \"Do you think I shall pull through, sir?\" \"I hope so, my\r\nman.\" And, as the two passed on, John's eye still followed them, with\r\nan intentness which would have won a clearer answer from them, had they\r\nseen it. A momentary shadow flitted over his face; then came the usual\r\nserenity, as if, in that brief eclipse, he had acknowledged the\r\nexistence of some hard possibility, and, asking nothing yet hoping all\r\nthings, left the issue in God's hands, with that submission which is\r\ntrue piety.\r\n\r\nThe next night, as I went my rounds with Dr. P., I happened to ask\r\nwhich man in the room probably suffered most; and, to my great\r\nsurprise, he glanced at John:\r\n\r\n\"Every breath he draws is like a stab; for the ball pierced the left\r\nlung, broke a rib, and did no end of damage here and there; so the poor\r\nlad can find neither forgetfulness nor ease, because he must lie on his\r\nwounded back or suffocate. It will be a hard struggle, and a long one,\r\nfor he possesses great vitality; but even his temperate life can't save\r\nhim; I wish it could.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean he must die, Doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless you, there's not the slightest hope for him; and you'd better\r\ntell him so before long; women have a way of doing such things\r\ncomfortably, so I leave it to you. He won't last more than a day or\r\ntwo, at furthest.\"\r\n\r\nI could have sat down on the spot and cried heartily, if I had not\r\nlearned the wisdom of bottling up one's tears for leisure moments. Such\r\nan end seemed very hard for such a man, when half a dozen worn out,\r\nworthless bodies round him, were gathering up the remnants of wasted\r\nlives, to linger on for years perhaps, burdens to others, daily\r\nreproaches to themselves. The army needed men like John, earnest,\r\nbrave, and faithful; fighting for liberty and justice with both heart\r\nand hand, true soldiers of the Lord. I could not give him up so soon,\r\nor think with any patience of so excellent a nature robbed of its\r\nfulfillment, and blundered into eternity by the rashness or stupidity\r\nof those at whose hands so many lives may be required. It was an easy\r\nthing for Dr. P. to say: \"Tell him he must die,\" but a cruelly hard\r\nthing to do, and by no means as \"comfortable\" as he politely suggested.\r\nI had not the heart to do it then, and privately indulged the hope that\r\nsome change for the better might take place, in spite of gloomy\r\nprophesies; so, rendering my task unnecessary. A few minutes later, as\r\nI came in again, with fresh rollers, I saw John sitting erect, with no\r\none to support him, while the surgeon dressed his back. I had never\r\nhitherto seen it done; for, having simpler wounds to attend to, and\r\nknowing the fidelity of the attendant, I had left John to him, thinking\r\nit might be more agreeable and safe; for both strength and experience\r\nwere needed in his case. I had forgotten that the strong man might long\r\nfor the gentle tendance of a woman's hands, the sympathetic magnetism\r\nof a woman's presence, as well as the feebler souls about him. The\r\nDoctor's words caused me to reproach myself with neglect, not of any\r\nreal duty perhaps, but of those little cares and kindnesses that solace\r\nhomesick spirits, and make the heavy hours pass easier. John looked\r\nlonely and forsaken just then, as he sat with bent head, hands folded\r\non his knee, and no outward sign of suffering, till, looking nearer, I\r\nsaw great tears roll down and drop upon the floor. It was a new sight\r\nthere; for, though I had seen many suffer, some swore, some groaned,\r\nmost endured silently, but none wept. Yet it did not seem weak, only\r\nvery touching, and straightway my fear vanished, my heart opened wide\r\nand took him in, as, gathering the bent head in my arms, as freely as\r\nif he had been a little child, I said, \"Let me help you bear it, John.\"\r\n\r\nNever, on any human countenance, have I seen so swift and beautiful a\r\nlook of gratitude, surprise and comfort, as that which answered me more\r\neloquently than the whispered--\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, ma'am, this is right good! this is what I wanted!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not ask for it before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't like to be a trouble; you seemed so busy, and I could manage\r\nto get on alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not want it any more, John.\"\r\n\r\nNor did he; for now I understood the wistful look that sometimes\r\nfollowed me, as I went out, after a brief pause beside his bed, or\r\nmerely a passing nod, while busied with those who seemed to need me\r\nmore than he, because more urgent in their demands; now I knew that to\r\nhim, as to so many, I was the poor substitute for mother, wife, or\r\nsister, and in his eyes no stranger, but a friend who hitherto had\r\nseemed neglectful; for, in his modesty, he had never guessed the truth.\r\nThis was changed now; and, through the tedious operation of probing,\r\nbathing, and dressing his wounds, he leaned against me, holding my hand\r\nfast, and, if pain wrung further tears from him, no one saw them fall\r\nbut me. When he was laid down again, I hovered about him, in a\r\nremorseful state of mind that would not let me rest, till I had bathed\r\nhis face, brushed his \"bonny brown hair,\" set all things smooth about\r\nhim, and laid a knot of heath and heliotrope on his clean pillow. While\r\ndoing this, he watched me with the satisfied expression I so liked to\r\nsee; and when I offered the little nosegay, held it carefully in his\r\ngreat hand, smoothed a ruffled leaf or two, surveyed and smelt it with\r\nan air of genuine delight, and lay contentedly regarding the glimmer of\r\nthe sunshine on the green. Although the manliest man among my forty, he\r\nsaid, \"Yes, ma'am,\" like a little boy; received suggestions for his\r\ncomfort with the quick smile that brightened his whole face; and now\r\nand then, as I stood tidying the table by his bed, I felt him softly\r\ntouch my gown, as if to assure himself that I was there. Anything more\r\nnatural and frank I never saw, and found this brave John as bashful as\r\nbrave, yet full of excellencies and fine aspirations, which, having no\r\npower to express themselves in words, seemed to have bloomed into his\r\ncharacter and made him what he was.\r\n\r\nAfter that night, an hour of each evening that remained to him was\r\ndevoted to his ease or pleasure. He could not talk much, for breath was\r\nprecious, and he spoke in whispers; but from occasional conversations,\r\nI gleaned scraps of private history which only added to the affection\r\nand respect I felt for him. Once he asked me to write a letter, and as\r\nI settled pen and paper, I said, with an irrepressible glimmer of\r\nfeminine curiosity, \"Shall it be addressed to wife, or mother, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, ma'am; I've got no wife, and will write to mother myself when\r\nI get better. Did you think I was married because of this?\" he asked,\r\ntouching a plain ring he wore, and often turned thoughtfully on his\r\nfinger when he lay alone.\r\n\r\n\"Partly that, but more from a settled sort of look you have; a look\r\nwhich young men seldom get until they marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know that; but I'm not so very young, ma'am, thirty in May,\r\nand have been what you might call settled this ten years; for mother's\r\na widow, I'm the oldest child she has, and it wouldn't do for me to\r\nmarry until Lizzy has a home of her own, and Laurie's learned his\r\ntrade; for we're not rich, and I must be father to the children and\r\nhusband to the dear old woman, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt but you are both, John; yet how came you to go to war, if you\r\nfelt so? Wasn't enlisting as bad as marrying?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am, not as I see it, for one is helping my neighbor, the other\r\npleasing myself. I went because I couldn't help it. I didn't want the\r\nglory or the pay; I wanted the right thing done, and people kept saying\r\nthe men who were in earnest ought to fight. I was in earnest, the Lord\r\nknows! but I held off as long as I could, not knowing which was my\r\nduty; mother saw the case, gave me her ring to keep me steady, and said\r\n'Go:' so I went.\"\r\n\r\nA short story and a simple one, but the man and the mother were\r\nportrayed better than pages of fine writing could have done it.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever regret that you came, when you lie here suffering so much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, ma'am; I haven't helped a great deal, but I've shown I was\r\nwilling to give my life, and perhaps I've got to; but I don't blame\r\nanybody, and if it was to do over again, I'd do it. I'm a little sorry\r\nI wasn't wounded in front; it looks cowardly to be hit in the back, but\r\nI obeyed orders, and it don't matter in the end, I know.\"\r\n\r\nPoor John! it did not matter now, except that a shot in the front might\r\nhave spared the long agony in store for him. He seemed to read the\r\nthought that troubled me, as he spoke so hopefully when there was no\r\nhope, for he suddenly added:\r\n\r\n\"This is my first battle; do they think it's going to be my last?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid they do, John.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the hardest question I had ever been called upon to answer;\r\ndoubly hard with those clear eyes fixed on mine, forcing a truthful\r\nanswer by their own truth. He seemed a little startled at first,\r\npondered over the fateful fact a moment, then shook his head, with a\r\nglance at the broad chest and muscular limbs stretched out before him:\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid, but it's difficult to believe all at once. I'm so\r\nstrong it don't seem possible for such a little wound to kill me.\"\r\n\r\nMerry Mercutio's dying words glanced through my memory as he spoke:\r\n\"'Tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but 'tis\r\nenough.\" And John would have said the same could he have seen the\r\nominous black holes between his shoulders; he never had; and, seeing\r\nthe ghastly sights about him, could not believe his own wound more\r\nfatal than these, for all the suffering it caused him.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I write to your mother, now?\" I asked, thinking that these\r\nsudden tidings might change all plans and purposes; but they did not;\r\nfor the man received the order of the Divine Commander to march with\r\nthe same unquestioning obedience with which the soldier had received\r\nthat of the human one, doubtless remembering that the first led him to\r\nlife, and the last to death.\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am; to Laurie just the same; he'll break it to her best, and\r\nI'll add a line to her myself when you get done.\"\r\n\r\nSo I wrote the letter which he dictated, finding it better than any I\r\nhad sent; for, though here and there a little ungrammatical or\r\ninelegant, each sentence came to me briefly worded, but most\r\nexpressive; full of excellent counsel to the boy, tenderly bequeathing\r\n\"mother and Lizzie\" to his care, and bidding him good bye in words the\r\nsadder for their simplicity. He added a few lines, with steady hand,\r\nand, as I sealed it, said, with a patient sort of sigh, \"I hope the\r\nanswer will come in time for me to see it;\" then, turning away his\r\nface, laid the flowers against his lips, as if to hide some quiver of\r\nemotion at the thought of such a sudden sundering of all the dear home\r\nties.\r\n\r\nThese things had happened two days before; now John was dying, and the\r\nletter had not come. I had been summoned to many death beds in my life,\r\nbut to none that made my heart ache as it did then, since my mother\r\ncalled me to watch the departure of a spirit akin to this in its\r\ngentleness and patient strength. As I went in, John stretched out both\r\nhands:\r\n\r\n\"I know you'd come! I guess I'm moving on, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\nHe was; and so rapidly that, even while he spoke, over his face I saw\r\nthe grey veil falling that no human hand can lift. I sat down by him,\r\nwiped the drops from his forehead, stirred the air about him with the\r\nslow wave of a fan, and waited to help him die. He stood in sore need\r\nof help--and I could do so little; for, as the doctor had foretold, the\r\nstrong body rebelled against death, and fought every inch of the way,\r\nforcing him to draw each breath with a spasm, and clench his hands with\r\nan imploring look, as if he asked, \"How long must I endure this, and be\r\nstill!\" For hours he suffered dumbly, without a moment's respite, or a\r\nmoment's murmuring; his limbs grew cold, his face damp, his lips white,\r\nand, again and again, he tore the covering off his breast, as if the\r\nlightest weight added to his agony; yet through it all, his eyes never\r\nlost their perfect serenity, and the man's soul seemed to sit therein,\r\nundaunted by the ills that vexed his flesh.\r\n\r\nOne by one, the men woke, and round the room appeared a circle of pale\r\nfaces and watchful eyes, full of awe and pity; for, though a stranger,\r\nJohn was beloved by all. Each man there had wondered at his patience,\r\nrespected his piety, admired his fortitude, and now lamented his hard\r\ndeath; for the influence of an upright nature had made itself deeply\r\nfelt, even in one little week. Presently, the Jonathan who so loved\r\nthis comely David, came creeping from his bed for a last look and word.\r\nThe kind soul was full of trouble, as the choke in his voice, the grasp\r\nof his hand, betrayed; but there were no tears, and the farewell of the\r\nfriends was the more touching for its brevity.\r\n\r\n\"Old boy, how are you?\" faltered the one.\r\n\r\n\"Most through, thank heaven!\" whispered the other.\r\n\r\n\"Can I say or do anything for you anywheres?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take my things home, and tell them that I did my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will! I will!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good bye, Ned.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good bye, John, good bye!\"\r\n\r\nThey kissed each other, tenderly as women, and so parted, for poor Ned\r\ncould not stay to see his comrade die. For a little while, there was no\r\nsound in the room but the drip of water, from a stump or two, and\r\nJohn's distressful gasps, as he slowly breathed his life away. I\r\nthought him nearly gone, and had just laid down the fan, believing its\r\nhelp to be no longer needed, when suddenly he rose up in his bed, and\r\ncried out with a bitter cry that broke the silence, sharply startling\r\nevery one with its agonized appeal:\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, give me air!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the only cry pain or death had wrung from him, the only boon he\r\nhad asked; and none of us could grant it, for all the airs that blew\r\nwere useless now. Dan flung up the window. The first red streak of dawn\r\nwas warming the grey east, a herald of the coming sun; John saw it, and\r\nwith the love of light which lingers in us to the end, seemed to read\r\nin it a sign of hope of help, for, over his whole face there broke that\r\nmysterious expression, brighter than any smile, which often comes to\r\neyes that look their last. He laid himself gently down; and, stretching\r\nout his strong right arm, as if to grasp and bring the blessed air to\r\nhis lips in a fuller flow, lapsed into a merciful unconsciousness,\r\nwhich assured us that for him suffering was forever past. He died then;\r\nfor, though the heavy breaths still tore their way up for a little\r\nlonger, they were but the waves of an ebbing tide that beat unfelt\r\nagainst the wreck, which an immortal voyager had deserted with a smile.\r\nHe never spoke again, but to the end held my hand close, so close that\r\nwhen he was asleep at last, I could not draw it away. Dan helped me,\r\nwarning me as he did so that it was unsafe for dead and living flesh to\r\nlie so long together; but though my hand was strangely cold and stiff,\r\nand four white marks remained across its back, even when warmth and\r\ncolor had returned elsewhere, I could not but be glad that, through its\r\ntouch, the presence of human sympathy, perhaps, had lightened that hard\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nWhen they had made him ready for the grave, John lay in state for half\r\nan hour, a thing which seldom happened in that busy place; but a\r\nuniversal sentiment of reverence and affection seemed to fill the\r\nhearts of all who had known or heard of him; and when the rumor of his\r\ndeath went through the house, always astir, many came to see him, and I\r\nfelt a tender sort of pride in my lost patient; for he looked a most\r\nheroic figure, lying there stately and still as the statue of some\r\nyoung knight asleep upon his tomb. The lovely expression which so often\r\nbeautifies dead faces, soon replaced the marks of pain, and I longed\r\nfor those who loved him best to see him when half an hour's\r\nacquaintance with Death had made them friends. As we stood looking at\r\nhim, the ward master handed me a letter, saying it had been forgotten\r\nthe night before. It was John's letter, come just an hour too late to\r\ngladden the eyes that had longed and looked for it so eagerly: yet he\r\nhad it; for, after I had cut some brown locks for his mother, and taken\r\noff the ring to send her, telling how well the talisman had done its\r\nwork, I kissed this good son for her sake, and laid the letter in his\r\nhand, still folded as when I drew my own away, feeling that its place\r\nwas there, and making myself happy with the thought, that, even in his\r\nsolitary place in the \"Government Lot,\" he would not be without some\r\ntoken of the love which makes life beautiful and outlives death. Then I\r\nleft him, glad to have known so genuine a man, and carrying with me an\r\nenduring memory of the brave Virginia blacksmith, as he lay serenely\r\nwaiting for the dawn of that long day which knows no night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOFF DUTY.\r\n\r\n\"My dear girl, we shall have you sick in your bed, unless you keep\r\nyourself warm and quiet for a few days. Widow Wadman can take care of\r\nthe ward alone, now the men are so comfortable, and have her vacation\r\nwhen you are about again. Now do be prudent in time, and don't let me\r\nhave to add a Periwinkle to my bouquet of patients.\"\r\n\r\nThis advice was delivered, in a paternal manner, by the youngest\r\nsurgeon in the hospital, a kind-hearted little gentleman, who seemed to\r\nconsider me a frail young blossom, that needed much cherishing, instead\r\nof a tough old spinster, who had been knocking about the world for\r\nthirty years. At the time I write of, he discovered me sitting on the\r\nstairs, with a nice cloud of unwholesome steam rising from the\r\nwashroom; a party of January breezes disporting themselves in the\r\nhalls; and perfumes, by no means from \"Araby the blest,\" keeping them\r\ncompany; while I enjoyed a fit of coughing, which caused my head to\r\nspin in a way that made the application of a cool banister both\r\nnecessary and agreeable, as I waited for the frolicsome wind to restore\r\nthe breath I'd lost; cheering myself, meantime, with a secret\r\nconviction that pneumonia was waiting for me round the corner. This\r\npiece of advice had been offered by several persons for a week, and\r\nrefused by me with the obstinacy with which my sex is so richly gifted.\r\nBut the last few hours had developed several surprising internal and\r\nexternal phenomena, which impressed upon me the fact that if I didn't\r\nmake a masterly retreat very soon, I should tumble down somewhere, and\r\nhave to be borne ignominiously from the field. My head felt like a\r\ncannon ball; my feet had a tendency to cleave to the floor; the walls\r\nat times undulated in a most disagreeable manner; people looked\r\nunnaturally big; and the \"very bottles on the mankle shelf\" appeared to\r\ndance derisively before my eyes. Taking these things into\r\nconsideration, while blinking stupidly at Dr. Z., I resolved to retire\r\ngracefully, if I must; so, with a valedictory to my boys, a private\r\nlecture to Mrs. Wadman, and a fervent wish that I could take off my\r\nbody and work in my soul, I mournfully ascended to my apartment, and\r\nNurse P. was reported off duty.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of any ardent damsel whose patriotic fancy may have\r\nsurrounded hospital life with a halo of charms, I will briefly describe\r\nthe bower to which I retired, in a somewhat ruinous condition. It was\r\nwell ventilated, for five panes of glass had suffered compound\r\nfractures, which all the surgeons and nurses had failed to heal; the\r\ntwo windows were draped with sheets, the church hospital opposite being\r\na brick and mortar Argus, and the female mind cherishing a prejudice in\r\nfavor of retiracy during the night-capped periods of existence. A bare\r\nfloor supported two narrow iron beds, spread with thin mattresses like\r\nplasters, furnished with pillows in the last stages of consumption. In\r\na fire place, guiltless of shovel, tongs, andirons, or grate, burned a\r\nlog, inch by inch, being too long to to go on all at once; so, while the\r\nfire blazed away at one end, I did the same at the other, as I tripped\r\nover it a dozen times a day, and flew up to poke it a dozen times at\r\nnight. A mirror (let us be elegant!) of the dimensions of a muffin, and\r\nabout as reflective, hung over a tin basin, blue pitcher, and a brace\r\nof yellow mugs. Two invalid tables, ditto chairs, wandered here and\r\nthere, and the closet contained a varied collection of bonnets,\r\nbottles, bags, boots, bread and butter, boxes and bugs. The closet was\r\na regular Blue Beard cupboard to me; I always opened it with fear and\r\ntrembling, owing to rats, and shut it in anguish of spirit; for time\r\nand space were not to be had, and chaos reigned along with the rats.\r\nOur chimney-piece was decorated with a flat-iron, a Bible, a candle\r\nminus stick, a lavender bottle, a new tin pan, so brilliant that it\r\nserved nicely for a pier-glass, and such of the portly black bugs as\r\npreferred a warmer climate than the rubbish hole afforded. Two arks,\r\ncommonly called trunks, lurked behind the door, containing the worldly\r\ngoods of the twain who laughed and cried, slept and scrambled, in this\r\nrefuge; while from the white-washed walls above either bed, looked down\r\nthe pictured faces of those whose memory can make for us--\r\n\r\n\"One little room an everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nFor a day or two I managed to appear at meals; for the human grub must\r\neat till the butterfly is ready to break loose, and no one had time to\r\ncome up two flights while it was possible for me to come down. Far be\r\nit from me to add another affliction or reproach to that enduring man,\r\nthe steward; for, compared with his predecessor, he was a horn of\r\nplenty; but--I put it to any candid mind--is not the following bill of\r\nfare susceptible of improvement, without plunging the nation madly into\r\ndebt? The three meals were \"pretty much of a muchness,\" and consisted\r\nof beef, evidently put down for the men of '76; pork, just in from the\r\nstreet; army bread, composed of saw-dust and saleratus; butter, salt as\r\nif churned by Lot's wife; stewed blackberries, so much like preserved\r\ncockroaches, that only those devoid of imagination could partake\r\nthereof with relish; coffee, mild and muddy; tea, three dried\r\nhuckleberry leaves to a quart of water--flavored with lime--also\r\nanimated and unconscious of any approach to clearness. Variety being\r\nthe spice of life, a small pinch of the article would have been\r\nappreciated by the hungry, hard-working sisterhood, one of whom, though\r\naccustomed to plain fare, soon found herself reduced to bread and\r\nwater; having an inborn repugnance to the fat of the land, and the salt\r\nof the earth.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of these hospital meals was the rapidity with which\r\nthe edibles vanished, and the impossibility of getting a drop or crumb\r\nafter the usual time. At the first ring of the bell, a general stampede\r\ntook place; some twenty hungry souls rushed to the dining-room, swept\r\nover the table like a swarm of locusts, and left no fragment for any\r\ntardy creature who arrived fifteen minutes late. Thinking it of more\r\nimportance that the patients should be well and comfortably fed, I took\r\nmy time about my own meals for the first day or two after I came, but\r\nwas speedily enlightened by Isaac, the black waiter, who bore with me a\r\nfew times, and then informed me, looking as stern as fate:\r\n\r\n\"I say, mam, ef you comes so late you can't have no vittles,--'cause\r\nI'm 'bleeged fer ter git things ready fer de doctors 'mazin' spry arter\r\nyou nusses and folks is done. De gen'lemen don't kere fer ter wait, no\r\nmore does I; so you jes' please ter come at de time, and dere won't be\r\nno frettin' nowheres.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a new sensation to stand looking at a full table, painfully\r\nconscious of one of the vacuums which Nature abhors, and receive orders\r\nto right about face, without partaking of the nourishment which your\r\ninner woman clamorously demanded. The doctors always fared better than\r\nwe; and for a moment a desperate impulse prompted me to give them a\r\nhint, by walking off with the mutton, or confiscating the pie. But\r\nIke's eye was on me, and, to my shame be it spoken, I walked meekly\r\naway; went dinnerless that day, and that evening went to market, laying\r\nin a small stock of crackers, cheese and apples, that my boys might not\r\nbe neglected, nor myself obliged to bolt solid and liquid dyspepsias,\r\nor starve. This plan would have succeeded admirably had not the evil\r\nstar under which I was born, been in the ascendant during that month,\r\nand cast its malign influences even into my \"'umble\" larder; for the\r\nrats had their dessert off my cheese, the bugs set up housekeeping in\r\nmy cracker-bag, and the apples like all worldly riches, took to\r\nthemselves wings and flew away; whither no man could tell, though\r\ncertain black imps might have thrown light upon the matter, had not the\r\nplaintiff in the case been loth to add another to the many trials of\r\nlong-suffering Africa. After this failure I resigned myself to fate,\r\nand, remembering that bread was called the staff of life, leaned pretty\r\nexclusively upon it; but it proved a broken reed, and I came to the\r\nground after a few weeks of prison fare, varied by an occasional potato\r\nor surreptitious sip of milk.\r\n\r\nVery soon after leaving the care of my ward, I discovered that I had no\r\nappetite, and cut the bread and butter interests almost entirely,\r\ntrying the exercise and sun cure instead. Flattering myself that I had\r\nplenty of time, and could see all that was to be seen, so far as a lone\r\nlorn female could venture in a city, one-half of whose male population\r\nseemed to be taking the other half to the guard-house,--every morning I\r\ntook a brisk run in one direction or another; for the January days were\r\nas mild as Spring. A rollicking north wind and occasional snow storm\r\nwould have been more to my taste, for the one would have braced and\r\nrefreshed tired body and soul, the other have purified the air, and\r\nspread a clean coverlid over the bed, wherein the capital of these\r\nUnited States appeared to be dozing pretty soundly just then.\r\n\r\nOne of these trips was to the Armory Hospital, the neatness, comfort,\r\nand convenience of which makes it an honor to its presiding genius, and\r\narouses all the covetous propensities of such nurses as came from other\r\nhospitals to visit it.\r\n\r\nThe long, clean, warm, and airy wards, built barrack-fashion, with the\r\nnurse's room at the end, were fully appreciated by Nurse Periwinkle,\r\nwhose ward and private bower were cold, dirty, inconvenient, up stairs\r\nand down stairs, and in every-body's chamber. At the Armory, in ward K,\r\nI found a cheery, bright-eyed, white-aproned little lady, reading at\r\nher post near the stove; matting under her feet; a draft of fresh air\r\nflowing in above her head; a table full of trays, glasses, and such\r\nmatters, on one side, a large, well-stocked medicine chest on the\r\nother; and all her duty seemed to be going about now and then to give\r\ndoses, issue orders, which well-trained attendants executed, and pet,\r\nadvise, or comfort Tom, Dick, or Harry, as she found best. As I watched\r\nthe proceedings, I recalled my own tribulations, and contrasted the two\r\nhospitals in a way that would have caused my summary dismissal, could\r\nit have been reported at headquarters. Here, order, method, common\r\nsense and liberality reigned and ruled, in a style that did one's heart\r\ngood to see; at the Hurly-burly Hotel, disorder, discomfort, bad\r\nmanagement, and no visible head, reduced things to a condition which I\r\ndespair of describing. The circumlocution fashion prevailed, forms and\r\nfusses tormented our souls, and unnecessary strictness in one place was\r\ncounterbalanced by unpardonable laxity in another. Here is a sample: I\r\nam dressing Sam Dammer's shoulder; and, having cleansed the wound, look\r\nabout for some strips of adhesive plaster to hold on the little square\r\nof wet linen which is to cover the gunshot wound; the case is not in\r\nthe tray; Frank, the sleepy, half-sick attendant, knows nothing of it;\r\nwe rummage high and low; Sam is tired, and fumes; Frank dawdles and\r\nyawns; the men advise and laugh at the flurry; I feel like a boiling\r\ntea-kettle, with the lid ready to fly off and damage somebody.\r\n\r\n\"Go and borrow some from the next ward, and spend the rest of the day\r\nin finding ours,\" I finally command. A pause; then Frank scuffles back\r\nwith the message: \"Miss Peppercorn ain't got none, and says you ain't\r\nno business to lose your own duds and go borrowin' other folkses.\" I\r\nsay nothing, for fear of saying too much, but fly to the surgery. Mr.\r\nToddypestle informs me that I can't have anything without an order from\r\nthe surgeon of my ward. Great heavens! where is he? and away I rush, up\r\nand down, here and there, till at last I find him, in a state of bliss\r\nover a complicated amputation, in the fourth story. I make my demand;\r\nhe answers: \"In five minutes,\" and works away, with his head upside\r\ndown, as he ties an artery, saws a bone, or does a little needle-work,\r\nwith a visible relish and very sanguinary pair of hands. The five\r\nminutes grow to fifteen, and Frank appears, with the remark that,\r\n\"Dammer wants to know what in thunder you are keeping him there with\r\nhis finger on a wet rag for?\" Dr. P. tears himself away long enough to\r\nscribble the order, with which I plunge downward to the surgery again,\r\nfind the door locked, and, while hammering away on it, am told that two\r\nfriends are waiting to see me in the hall. The matron being away, her\r\nparlor is locked, and there is no where to see my guests but in my own\r\nroom, and no time to enjoy them till the plaster is found. I settle\r\nthis matter, and circulate through the house to find Toddypestle, who\r\nhas no right to leave the surgery till night. He is discovered in the\r\ndead house, smoking a cigar, and very much the worse for his researches\r\namong the spirituous preparations that fill the surgery shelves. He is\r\ninclined to be gallant, and puts the finishing blow to the fire of my\r\nwrath; for the tea-kettle lid flies off, and driving him before me to\r\nhis post, I fling down the order, take what I choose; and, leaving the\r\nabsurd incapable kissing his hand to me, depart, feeling as Grandma\r\nRiglesty is reported to have done, when she vainly sought for chips, in\r\nBimleck Jackwood's \"shifless paster.\"\r\n\r\nI find Dammer a well acted charade of his own name, and, just as I get\r\nhim done, struggling the while with a burning desire to clap an\r\nadhesive strip across his mouth, full of heaven-defying oaths, Frank\r\ntakes up his boot to put it on, and exclaims:\r\n\r\n\"I'm blest ef here ain't that case now! I recollect seeing it pitch in\r\nthis mornin', but forgot all about it, till my heel went smash inter\r\nit. Here, ma'am, ketch hold on it, and give the boys a sheet on't all\r\nround, 'gainst it tumbles inter t'other boot next time yer want it.\"\r\n\r\nIf a look could annihilate, Francis Saucebox would have ceased to\r\nexist; but it couldn't; therefore, he yet lives, to aggravate some\r\nunhappy woman's soul, and wax fat in some equally congenial situation.\r\n\r\nNow, while I'm freeing my mind, I should like to enter my protest\r\nagainst employing convalescents as attendants, instead of strong,\r\nproperly trained, and cheerful men. How it may be in other places I\r\ncannot say; but here it was a source of constant trouble and confusion,\r\nthese feeble, ignorant men trying to sweep, scrub, lift, and wait upon\r\ntheir sicker comrades. One, with a diseased heart, was expected to run\r\nup and down stairs, carry heavy trays, and move helpless men; he tried\r\nit, and grew rapidly worse than when he first came: and, when he was\r\nordered out to march away to the convalescent hospital, fell, in a sort\r\nof fit, before he turned the corner, and was brought back to die.\r\nAnother, hurt by a fall from his horse, endeavored to do his duty, but\r\nfailed entirely, and the wrath of the ward master fell upon the nurse,\r\nwho must either scrub the rooms herself, or take the lecture; for the\r\nboy looked stout and well, and the master never happened to see him\r\nturn white with pain, or hear him groan in his sleep when an\r\ninvoluntary motion strained his poor back. Constant complaints were\r\nbeing made of incompetent attendants, and some dozen women did double\r\nduty, and then were blamed for breaking down. If any hospital director\r\nfancies this a good and economical arrangement, allow one used up nurse\r\nto tell him it isn't, and beg him to spare the sisterhood, who\r\nsometimes, in their sympathy, forget that they are mortal, and run the\r\nrisk of being made immortal, sooner than is agreeable to their partial\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAnother of my few rambles took me to the Senate Chamber, hoping to hear\r\nand see if this large machine was run any better than some small ones I\r\nknew of. I was too late, and found the Speaker's chair occupied by a\r\ncolored gentleman of ten; while two others were \"on their legs,\" having\r\na hot debate on the cornball question, as they gathered the waste paper\r\nstrewn about the floor into bags; and several white members played\r\nleap-frog over the desks, a much wholesomer relaxation than some of the\r\nolder Senators indulge in, I fancy. Finding the coast clear, I likewise\r\ngambolled up and down, from gallery to gallery; sat in Sumner's chair,\r\nand cudgelled an imaginary Brooks within an inch of his life; examined\r\nWilson's books in the coolest possible manner; warmed my feet at one of\r\nthe national registers; read people's names on scattered envelopes, and\r\npocketed a castaway autograph or two; watched the somewhat\r\nunparliamentary proceedings going on about me, and wondered who in the\r\nworld all the sedate gentlemen were, who kept popping out of odd doors\r\nhere and there, like respectable Jacks-in-the-box. Then I wandered over\r\nthe \"palatial residence\" of Mrs. Columbia, and examined its many\r\nbeauties, though I can't say I thought her a tidy housekeeper, and\r\ndidn't admire her taste in pictures, for the eye of this humble\r\nindividual soon wearied of expiring patriots, who all appeared to be\r\nquitting their earthly tabernacles in convulsions, ruffled shirts, and\r\na whirl of torn banners, bomb shells, and buff and blue arms and legs.\r\nThe statuary also was massive and concrete, but rather wearying to\r\nexamine; for the colossal ladies and gentlemen, carried no cards of\r\nintroduction in face or figure; so, whether the meditative party in a\r\nkilt, with well-developed legs, shoes like army slippers, and a\r\nponderous nose, was Columbus, Cato, or Cockelorum Tibby, the tragedian,\r\nwas more than I could tell. Several robust ladies attracted me; as I \r\nfelt particularly \"wimbly\" myself, as the old country women say: but\r\nwhich was America and which Pocahontas was a mystery, for all affected\r\nmuch looseness of costume, dishevelment of hair, swords, arrows,\r\nlances, scales, and other ornaments quite passé with damsels of our\r\nday, whose effigies should go down to posterity armed with fans,\r\ncrochet needles, riding whips, and parasols, with here and there one\r\nholding pen or pencil, rolling-pin or broom. The statue of Liberty I\r\nrecognized at once, for it had no pedestal as yet, but stood flat in\r\nthe mud, with Young America most symbolically making dirt pies, and\r\nchip forts, in its shadow. But high above the squabbling little throng\r\nand their petty plans, the sun shone full on Liberty's broad forehead,\r\nand, in her hand, some summer bird had built its nest. I accepted the\r\ngood omen then, and, on the first of January, the Emancipation Act gave\r\nthe statue a nobler and more enduring pedestal than any marble or\r\ngranite ever carved and quarried by human hands.\r\n\r\nOne trip to Georgetown Heights, where cedars sighed overhead, dead\r\nleaves rustled underfoot, pleasant paths led up and down, and a brook\r\nwound like a silver snake by the blackened ruins of some French\r\nMinister's house, through the poor gardens of the black washerwomen who\r\ncongregated there, and, passing the cemetery with a murmurous lullaby,\r\nrolled away to pay its little tribute to the river. This breezy run was\r\nthe last I took; for, on the morrow, came rain and wind: and\r\nconfinement soon proved a powerful reinforcement to the enemy, who was\r\nquietly preparing to spring a mine, and blow me five hundred miles from\r\nthe position I had taken in what I called my Chickahominy Swamp.\r\n\r\nShut up in my room, with no voice, spirits, or books, that week was not\r\na holiday, by any means. Finding meals a humbug, I stopped away\r\naltogether, trusting that if this sparrow was of any worth, the Lord\r\nwould not let it fall to the ground. Like a flock of friendly ravens,\r\nmy sister nurses fed me, not only with food for the body, but kind\r\nwords for the mind; and soon, from being half starved, I found myself\r\nso beteaed and betoasted, petted and served, that I was quite \"in the\r\nlap of luxury,\" in spite of cough, headache, a painful consciousness of\r\nmy pleura, and a realizing sense of bones in the human frame. From the\r\npleasant house on the hill, the home in the heart of Washington, and\r\nthe Willard caravansary, came friends new and old, with bottles,\r\nbaskets, carriages and invitations for the invalid; and daily our\r\nFlorence Nightingale climbed the steep stairs, stealing a moment from\r\nher busy life, to watch over the stranger, of whom she was as\r\nthoughtfully tender as any mother. Long may she wave! Whatever others\r\nmay think or say, Nurse Periwinkle is forever grateful; and among her\r\nrelics of that Washington defeat, none is more valued than the little\r\nbook which appeared on her pillow, one dreary day; for the D. D. written\r\nin it means to her far more than Doctor of Divinity.\r\n\r\nBeing forbidden to meddle with fleshly arms and legs, I solaced myself\r\nby mending cotton ones, and, as I sat sewing at my window, watched the\r\nmoving panorama that passed below; amusing myself with taking notes of\r\nthe most striking figures in it. Long trains of army wagons kept up a\r\nperpetual rumble from morning till night; ambulances rattled to and fro\r\nwith busy surgeons, nurses taking an airing, or convalescents going in\r\nparties to be fitted to artificial limbs. Strings of sorry looking\r\nhorses passed, saying as plainly as dumb creatures could, \"Why, in a\r\ncity full of them, is there no _horse_pital for us?\" Often a cart came\r\nby, with several rough coffins in it and no mourners following;\r\nbarouches, with invalid officers, rolled round the corner, and carriage\r\nloads of pretty children, with black coachmen, footmen, and maids. The\r\nwomen who took their walks abroad, were so extinguished in three story\r\nbonnets, with overhanging balconies of flowers, that their charms were\r\nobscured; and all I can say of them is, that they dressed in the worst\r\npossible taste, and walked like ducks.\r\n\r\nThe men did the picturesque, and did it so well that Washington looked\r\nlike a mammoth masquerade. Spanish hats, scarlet lined riding cloaks,\r\nswords and sashes, high boots and bright spurs, beards and mustaches,\r\nwhich made plain faces comely, and comely faces heroic; these vanities\r\nof the flesh transformed our butchers, bakers, and candlestick makers\r\ninto gallant riders of gaily caparisoned horses, much handsomer than\r\nthemselves; and dozens of such figures were constantly prancing by,\r\nwith private prickings of spurs, for the benefit of the perambulating\r\nflower-bed. Some of these gentlemen affected painfully tight uniforms,\r\nand little caps, kept on by some new law of gravitation, as they\r\ncovered only the bridge of the nose, yet never fell off; the men looked\r\nlike stuffed fowls, and rode as if the safety of the nation depended on\r\ntheir speed alone. The fattest, greyest officers dressed most, and\r\nambled statelily along, with orderlies behind, trying to look as if\r\nthey didn't know the stout party in front, and doing much caracoling on\r\ntheir own account.\r\n\r\nThe mules were my especial delight; and an hour's study of a constant\r\nsuccession of them introduced me to many of their characteristics; for\r\nsix of these odd little beasts drew each army wagon, and went hopping\r\nlike frogs through the stream of mud that gently rolled along the\r\nstreet. The coquettish mule had small feet, a nicely trimmed tassel of\r\na tail, perked up ears, and seemed much given to little tosses of the\r\nhead, affected skips and prances; and, if he wore the bells, or were\r\nbedizzened with a bit of finery, put on as many airs as any belle. The\r\nmoral mule was a stout, hard-working creature, always tugging with all\r\nhis might; often pulling away after the rest had stopped, laboring\r\nunder the conscientious delusion that food for the entire army depended\r\nupon his private exertions. I respected this style of mule; and, had I\r\npossessed a juicy cabbage, would have pressed it upon him, with thanks\r\nfor his excellent example. The historical mule was a melo-dramatic\r\nquadruped, prone to startling humanity by erratic leaps, and wild\r\nplunges, much shaking of his stubborn head, and lashing out of his\r\nvicious heels; now and then falling flat, and apparently dying a la\r\nForrest: a gasp--a squirm--a flop, and so on, till the street was well\r\nblocked up, the drivers all swearing like demons in bad hats, and the\r\nchief actor's circulation decidedly quickened by every variety of kick,\r\ncuff, jerk, and haul. When the last breath seemed to have left his body,\r\nand \"Doctors were in vain,\" a sudden resurrection took place; and if\r\never a mule laughed with scornful triumph, that was the beast, as he\r\nleisurely rose, gave a comfortable shake; and, calmly regarding the\r\nexcited crowd seemed to say--\"A hit! a decided hit! for the stupidest\r\nof animals has bamboozled a dozen men. Now, then! what are _you_\r\nstopping the way for?\" The pathetic mule was, perhaps, the most\r\ninteresting of all; for, though he always seemed to be the smallest,\r\nthinnest, weakest of the six, the postillion, with big boots,\r\nlong-tailed coat, and heavy whip, was sure to bestride this one, who\r\nstruggled feebly along, head down, coat muddy and rough, eye spiritless\r\nand sad, his very tail a mortified stump, and the whole beast a picture\r\nof meek misery, fit to touch a heart of stone. The jovial mule was a\r\nroly poly, happy-go-lucky little piece of horse-flesh, taking everything\r\neasily, from cudgeling to caressing; strolling along with a roguish\r\ntwinkle of the eye, and, if the thing were possible, would have had his\r\nhands in his pockets, and whistled as he went. If there ever chanced to\r\nbe an apple core, a stray turnip, or wisp of hay, in the gutter, this\r\nMark Tapley was sure to find it, and none of his mates seemed to\r\nbegrudge him his bite. I suspected this fellow was the peacemaker,\r\nconfidant and friend of all the others, for he had a sort of\r\n\"Cheer-up,-old-boy,-I'll-pull-you-through\" look, which was exceedingly\r\nengaging.\r\n\r\nPigs also possessed attractions for me, never having had an opportunity\r\nof observing their graces of mind and manner, till I came to\r\nWashington, whose porcine citizens appeared to enjoy a larger liberty\r\nthan many of its human ones. Stout, sedate looking pigs, hurried by\r\neach morning to their places of business, with a preoccupied air, and\r\nsonorous greeting to their friends. Genteel pigs, with an extra curl to\r\ntheir tails, promenaded in pairs, lunching here and there, like\r\ngentlemen of leisure. Rowdy pigs pushed the passers by off the side\r\nwalk; tipsy pigs hiccoughed their version of \"We wont go home till\r\nmorning,\" from the gutter; and delicate young pigs tripped daintily\r\nthrough the mud, as if, like \"Mrs. Peerybingle,\" they plumed themselves\r\nupon their ankles, and kept themselves particularly neat in point of\r\nstockings. Maternal pigs, with their interesting families, strolled by\r\nin the sun; and often the pink, baby-like squealers lay down for a nap,\r\nwith a trust in Providence worthy of human imitation.\r\n\r\nBut more interesting than officers, ladies, mules, or pigs, were my\r\ncolored brothers and sisters, because so unlike the respectable members\r\nof society I'd known in moral Boston.\r\n\r\nHere was the genuine article--no, not the genuine article at all, we\r\nmust go to Africa for that--but the sort of creatures generations of\r\nslavery have made them: obsequious, trickish, lazy and ignorant, yet\r\nkind-hearted, merry-tempered, quick to feel and accept the least token\r\nof the brotherly love which is slowly teaching the white hand to grasp\r\nthe black, in this great struggle for the liberty of both the races.\r\n\r\nHaving been warned not to be too rampant on the subject of slavery, as\r\nsecesh principles flourished even under the respectable nose of Father\r\nAbraham, I had endeavored to walk discreetly, and curb my unruly\r\nmember; looking about me with all my eyes, the while, and saving up the\r\nresult of my observations for future use. I had not been there a week,\r\nbefore the neglected, devil-may care expression in many of the faces\r\nabout me, seemed an urgent appeal to leave nursing white bodies, and\r\ntake some care for these black souls. Much as the lazy boys and saucy\r\ngirls tormented me, I liked them, and found that any show of interest\r\nor friendliness brought out the better traits which live in the most\r\ndegraded and forsaken of us all. I liked their cheerfulness, for the\r\ndreariest old hag, who scrubbed all day in that pestilential steam,\r\ngossipped and grinned all the way out, when night set her free from\r\ndrudgery. The girls romped with their dusky sweethearts, or tossed\r\ntheir babies, with the tender pride that makes mother-love a beautifier\r\nto the homeliest face. The men and boys sang and whistled all day long;\r\nand often, as I held my watch, the silence of the night was sweetly\r\nbroken by some chorus from the street, full of real melody, whether the\r\nsong was of heaven, or of hoe-cakes; and, as I listened, I felt that we\r\nnever should doubt nor despair concerning a race which, through such\r\ngriefs and wrongs, still clings to this good gift, and seems to solace\r\nwith it the patient hearts that wait and watch and hope until the end.\r\n\r\nI expected to have to defend myself from accusations of prejudice\r\nagainst color; but was surprised to find things just the other way, and\r\ndaily shocked some neighbor by treating the blacks as I did the whites.\r\nThe men _would_ swear at the \"darkies,\" would put two _gs_ into negro,\r\nand scoff at the idea of any good coming from such trash. The nurses\r\nwere willing to be served by the colored people, but seldom thanked\r\nthem, never praised, and scarcely recognized them in the street; whereat\r\nthe blood of two generations of abolitionists waxed hot in my veins,\r\nand, at the first opportunity, proclaimed itself, and asserted the right\r\nof free speech as doggedly as the irrepressible Folsom herself.\r\n\r\nHappening to catch up a funny little black baby, who was toddling about\r\nthe nurses' kitchen, one day, when I went down to make a mess for some\r\nof my men, a Virginia woman standing by elevated her most prominent\r\nfeatures, with a sniff of disapprobation, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Gracious, Miss P.! how can you? I've been here six months. and never\r\nso much as touched the little toad with a poker.\"\r\n\r\n\"More shame for you, ma'am,\" responded Miss P.; and, with the natural\r\nperversity of a Yankee, followed up the blow by kissing \"the toad,\"\r\nwith ardor. His face was providentially as clean and shiny as if his\r\nmamma had just polished it up with a corner of her apron and a drop\r\nfrom the tea-kettle spout, like old Aunt Chloe. This rash act, and the\r\nanti-slavery lecture that followed, while one hand stirred gruel for\r\nsick America, and the other hugged baby Africa, did not produce the\r\ncheering result which I fondly expected; for my comrade henceforth\r\nregarded me as a dangerous fanatic, and my protegé nearly came to his\r\ndeath by insisting on swarming up stairs to my room, on all occasions,\r\nand being walked on like a little black spider.\r\n\r\nI waited for New Year's day with more eagerness than I had ever known\r\nbefore; and, though it brought me no gift, I felt rich in the act of\r\njustice so tardily performed toward some of those about me. As the\r\nbells rung midnight, I electrified my room-mate by dancing out of bed,\r\nthrowing up the window, and flapping my handkerchief, with a feeble\r\ncheer, in answer to the shout of a group of colored men in the street\r\nbelow. All night they tooted and tramped, fired crackers, sung \"Glory,\r\nHallelujah,\" and took comfort, poor souls! in their own way. The sky\r\nwas clear, the moon shone benignly, a mild wind blew across the river,\r\nand all good omens seemed to usher in the dawn of the day whose\r\nnoontide cannot now be long in coming. If the colored people had taken\r\nhands and danced around the White House, with a few cheers for the much\r\nabused gentleman who has immortalized himself by one just act, no\r\nPresident could have had a finer levee, or one to be prouder of.\r\n\r\nWhile these sights and sounds were going on without, curious scenes\r\nwere passing within, and I was learning that one of the best methods of\r\nfitting oneself to be a nurse in a hospital, is to be a patient there;\r\nfor then only can one wholly realize what the men suffer and sigh for;\r\nhow acts of kindness touch and win; how much or little we are to those\r\nabout us; and for the first time really see that in coming there we\r\nhave taken our lives in our hands, and may have to pay dearly for a\r\nbrief experience. Every one was very kind; the attendants of my ward\r\noften came up to report progress, to fill my wood-box, or bring\r\nmessages and presents from my boys. The nurses took many steps with\r\nthose tired feet of theirs, and several came each evening, to chat over\r\nmy fire and make things cosy for the night. The doctors paid daily\r\nvisits, tapped at my lungs to see if pneumonia was within, left doses\r\nwithout names, and went away, leaving me as ignorant, and much more\r\nuncomfortable than when they came. Hours began to get confused; people\r\nlooked odd; queer faces haunted the room, and the nights were one long\r\nfight with weariness and pain. Letters from home grew anxious; the\r\ndoctors lifted their eyebrows, and nodded ominously; friends said\r\n\"Don't stay,\" and an internal rebellion seconded the advice; but the\r\nthree months were not out, and the idea of giving up so soon was\r\nproclaiming a defeat before I was fairly routed; so to all \"Don't\r\nstays\" I opposed \"I wills,\" till, one fine morning, a gray-headed\r\ngentleman rose like a welcome ghost on my hearth; and, at the sight of\r\nhim, my resolution melted away, my heart turned traitor to my boys,\r\nand, when he said, \"Come home,\" I answered, \"Yes, father;\" and so ended\r\nmy career as an army nurse.\r\n\r\nI never shall regret the going, though a sharp tussle with typhoid, ten\r\ndollars, and a wig, are all the visible results of the experiment; for\r\none may live and learn much in a month. A good fit of illness proves\r\nthe value of health; real danger tries one's mettle; and self-sacrifice\r\nsweetens character. Let no one who sincerely desires to help the work\r\non in this way, delay going through any fear; for the worth of life\r\nlies in the experiences that fill it, and this is one which cannot be\r\nforgotten. All that is best and bravest in the hearts of men and women,\r\ncomes out in scenes like these; and, though a hospital is a rough\r\nschool, its lessons are both stern and salutary; and the humblest of\r\npupils there, in proportion to his faithfulness, learns a deeper faith\r\nin God and in himself. I, for one, would return tomorrow, on the\r\n\"up-again,-and-take-another\" principle, if I could; for the amount of\r\npleasure and profit I got out of that month compensates for all after\r\npangs; and, though a sadly womanish feeling, I take some satisfaction\r\nin the thought that, if I could not lay my head on the altar of my\r\ncountry, I have my hair; and that is more than handsome Helen did for\r\nher dead husband, when she sacrificed only the ends of her ringlets on\r\nhis urn. Therefore, I close this little chapter of hospital\r\nexperiences, with the regret that they were no better worth recording;\r\nand add the poetical gem with which I console myself for the untimely\r\ndemise of \"Nurse Periwinkle:\"\r\n\r\n    Oh, lay her in a little pit,\r\n    With a marble stone to cover it;\r\n    And carve thereon a gruel spoon,\r\n    To show a \"nuss\" has died too soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA POSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\nMy Dear S.:--As inquiries like your own have come to me from various\r\nfriendly readers of the Sketches, I will answer them en masse and in\r\nprinted form, as a sort of postscript to what has gone before. One of\r\nthese questions was, \"Are there no services by hospital death-beds, or\r\non Sundays?\"\r\n\r\nIn most Hospitals I hope there are; in ours, the men died, and were\r\ncarried away, with as little ceremony as on a battle-field. The first\r\nevent of this kind which I witnessed was so very brief, and bare of\r\nanything like reverence, sorrow, or pious consolation, that I heartily\r\nagreed with the bluntly expressed opinion of a Maine man lying next his\r\ncomrade, who died with no visible help near him, but a compassionate\r\nwoman and a tender-hearted Irishman, who dropped upon his knees, and\r\ntold his beads, with Catholic fervor, for the good of his Protestant\r\nbrother's parting soul:\r\n\r\n\"If, after gettin' all the hard knocks, we are left to die this way,\r\nwith nothing but a Paddy's prayers to help us, I guess Christians are\r\nrather scarce round Washington.\"\r\n\r\nI thought so too; but though Miss Blank, one of my mates, anxious that\r\nsouls should be ministered to, as well as bodies, spoke more than once\r\nto the Chaplain, nothing ever came of it. Unlike another Shepherd,\r\nwhose earnest piety weekly purified the Senate Chamber, this man did\r\nnot feed as well as fold his flock, nor make himself a human symbol of\r\nthe Divine Samaritan, who never passes by on the other side.\r\n\r\nI have since learned that our non-committal Chaplain had been a\r\nProfessor, in some Southern College; and, though he maintained that he\r\nhad no secesh proclivities, I can testify that he seceded from his\r\nministerial duties, I may say, skedaddled; for, being one of his own\r\nwords, it is as appropriate as inelegant. He read Emerson, quoted\r\nCarlyle, and tried to be a Chaplain; but judging from his success, I am\r\nafraid he still hankered after the hominy pots of Rebeldom.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, on a Sunday afternoon, such of the nurses, officers,\r\nattendants, and patients as could avail themselves of it, were gathered\r\nin the Ball Room, for an hour's service, of which the singing was the\r\nbetter part. To me it seemed that if ever strong, wise, and loving\r\nwords were needed, it was then; if ever mortal man had living texts\r\nbefore his eyes to illustrate and illuminate his thought, it was there;\r\nand if ever hearts were prompted to devoutest self-abnegation, it was\r\nin the work which brought us to anything but a Chapel of Ease. But some\r\nspiritual paralysis seemed to have befallen our pastor; for, though\r\nmany faces turned toward him, full of the dumb hunger that often comes\r\nto men when suffering or danger brings then nearer to the heart of\r\nthings, they were offered the chaff of divinity, and its wheat was left\r\nfor less needy gleaners, who knew where to look. Even the fine old\r\nBible stories, which may be made as lifelike as any history of our day,\r\nby a vivid fancy and pictorial diction, were robbed of all their charms\r\nby dry explanations and literal applications, instead of being useful\r\nand pleasant lessons to those men, whom weakness had rendered as docile\r\nas children in a father's hands.\r\n\r\nI watched the listless countenances all about me, while a mild Daniel\r\nwas moralizing in a den of utterly uninteresting lions; while Shadrach,\r\nMeshech, and Abednego were leisurely passing through the fiery furnace,\r\nwhere, I sadly feared, some of us sincerely wished they had remained as\r\npermanencies; while the Temple of Solomon was laboriously erected, with\r\nminute descriptions of the process, and any quantity of bells and\r\npomegranates on the raiment of the priests. Listless they were at the\r\nbeginning, and listless at the end; but the instant some stirring old\r\nhymn was given out, sleepy eyes brightened, lounging figures sat erect,\r\nand many a poor lad rose up in his bed, or stretch an eager hand for\r\nthe book, while all broke out with a heartiness that proved that\r\nsomewhere at the core of even the most abandoned, there still glowed\r\nsome remnant of the native piety that flows in music from the heart of\r\nevery little child. Even the big rebel joined, and boomed away in a\r\nthunderous bass, singing--\r\n\r\n    \"Salvation! let the echoes fly,\"\r\n\r\nas energetically as if he felt the need of a speedy execution of the\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThat was the pleasantest moment of the hour, for then it seemed a\r\nhomelike and happy spot; the groups of men looking over one another's\r\nshoulders as they sang; the few silent figures in the beds; here and\r\nthere a woman noiselessly performing some necessary duty, and singing\r\nas she worked; while in the arm chair standing in the midst, I placed,\r\nfor my own satisfaction, the imaginary likeness of a certain faithful\r\npastor, who took all outcasts by the hand, smote the devil in whatever\r\nguise he came, and comforted the indigent in spirit with the best\r\nwisdom of a great and tender heart, which still speaks to us from its\r\nItalian grave. With that addition, my picture was complete; and I often\r\nlonged to take a veritable sketch of a Hospital Sunday, for, despite\r\nits drawbacks, consisting of continued labor, the want of proper books,\r\nthe barren preaching that bore no fruit, this day was never like the\r\nother six.\r\n\r\nTrue to their home training, our New England boys did their best to\r\nmake it what it should be. With many, there was much reading of\r\nTestaments, humming over of favorite hymns, and looking at such books\r\nas I could cull from a miscellaneous library. Some lay idle, slept, or\r\ngossiped; yet, when I came to them for a quiet evening chat, they often\r\ntalked freely and well of themselves; would blunder out some timid hope\r\nthat their troubles might \"do 'em good, and keep 'em stiddy;\" would\r\nchoke a little, as they said good night, and turned their faces to the\r\nwall to think of mother, wife, or home, these human ties seeming to be\r\nthe most vital religion which they yet knew. I observed that some of\r\nthem did not wear their caps on this day, though at other times they\r\nclung to them like Quakers; wearing them in bed, putting them on to\r\nread the paper, eat an apple, or write a letter, as if, like a new sort\r\nof Samson, their strength lay, not in their hair, but in their hats.\r\nMany read no novels, swore less, were more silent, orderly, and\r\ncheerful, as if the Lord were an invisible Ward-master, who went his\r\nrounds but once a week, and must find all things at their best. I liked\r\nall this in the poor, rough boys, and could have found it in my heart\r\nto put down sponge and tea-pot, and preach a little sermon then and\r\nthere, while homesickness and pain had made these natures soft, that\r\nsome good seed might be cast therein, to blossom and bear fruit here or\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nRegarding the admission of friends to nurse their sick, I can only say,\r\nit was not allowed at Hurly-burly House; though one indomitable parent\r\ntook my ward by storm, and held her position, in spite of doctors,\r\nmatron, and Nurse Periwinkle. Though it was against the rules, though\r\nthe culprit was an acid, frost-bitten female, though the young man\r\nwould have done quite as well without her anxious fussiness, and the\r\nwhole room-full been much more comfortable, there was something so\r\nirresistible in this persistent devotion, that no one had the heart to\r\noust her from her post. She slept on the floor, without uttering a\r\ncomplaint; bore jokes somewhat of the rudest; fared scantily, though\r\nher basket was daily filled with luxuries for her boy; and tended that\r\npetulant personage with a never-failing patience beautiful to see.\r\n\r\nI feel a glow of moral rectitude in saying this of her; for, though a\r\nperfect pelican to her young, she pecked and cackled (I don't know that\r\npelicans usually express their emotions in that manner,) most\r\nobstreperously, when others invaded her premises; and led me a weary\r\nlife, with \"George's tea-rusks,\" \"George's foot-bath,\" \"George's\r\nmeasles,\" and \"George's mother;\" till after a sharp passage of arms and\r\ntongues with the matron, she wrathfully packed up her rusks, her son,\r\nand herself, and departed, in an ambulance, scolding to the very last.\r\n\r\nThis is the comic side of the matter. The serious one is harder to\r\ndescribe; for the presence, however brief, of relations and friends by\r\nthe bedside of the dead or dying, is always a trial to the bystanders.\r\nThey are not near enough to know how best to comfort, yet too near to\r\nturn their backs upon the sorrow that finds its only solace in\r\nlistening to recitals of last words, breathed into nurse's ears, or\r\nreceiving the tender legacies of love and longing bequeathed through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTo me, the saddest sight I saw in that sad place, was the spectacle of\r\na grey-haired father, sitting hour after hour by his son, dying from\r\nthe poison of his wound. The old father, hale and hearty; the young\r\nson, past all help, though one could scarcely believe it; for the\r\nsubtle fever, burning his strength away, flushed his cheeks with color,\r\nfilled his eyes with lustre, and lent a mournful mockery of health to\r\nface and figure, making the poor lad comelier in death than in life.\r\nHis bed was not in my ward; but I was often in and out, and for a day\r\nor two, the pair were much together, saying little, but looking much.\r\nThe old man tried to busy himself with book or pen, that his presence\r\nmight not be a burden; and once, when he sat writing, to the anxious\r\nmother at home, doubtless, I saw the son's eyes fix upon his face, with\r\na look of mingled resignation and regret, as if endeavoring to teach\r\nhimself to say cheerfully the long good bye. And again, when the son\r\nslept, the father watched him, as he had himself been watched; and\r\nthough no feature of his grave countenance changed, the rough hand,\r\nsmoothing the lock of hair upon the pillow, the bowed attitude of the\r\ngrey head, were more pathetic than the loudest lamentations. The son\r\ndied; and the father took home the pale relic of the life he gave,\r\noffering a little money to the nurse, as the only visible return it was\r\nin his power to make her; for though very grateful, he was poor. Of\r\ncourse, she did not take it, but found a richer compensation in the old\r\nman's earnest declaration:\r\n\r\n\"My boy couldn't have been better cared for if he'd been at home; and\r\nGod will reward you for it, though I can't.\"\r\n\r\nMy own experiences of this sort began when my first man died. He had\r\nscarcely been removed, when his wife came in. Her eye went straight to\r\nthe well-known bed; it was empty; and feeling, yet not believing the\r\nhard truth, she cried out, with a look I never shall forget:\r\n\r\n\"Why, where's Emanuel?\"\r\n\r\nI had never seen her before, did not know her relationship to the man\r\nwhom I had only nursed for a day, and was about to tell her he was\r\ngone, when McGee, the tender-hearted Irishman before mentioned, brushed\r\nby me with a cheerful--\"It's shifted to a better bed he is, Mrs.\r\nConnel. Come out, dear, till I show ye;\" and, taking her gently by the\r\narm, he led her to the matron, who broke the heavy tidings to the wife,\r\nand comforted the widow.\r\n\r\nAnother day, running up to my room for a breath of fresh air and a five\r\nminutes' rest after a disagreeable task, I found a stout young woman\r\nsitting on my bed, wearing the miserable look which I had learned to\r\nknow by that time. Seeing her, reminded me that I had heard of some\r\none's dying in the night, and his sister's arriving in the morning.\r\nThis must be she, I thought. I pitied her with all my heart. What could\r\nI say or do? Words always seem impertinent at such times; I did not\r\nknow the man; the woman was neither interesting in herself nor graceful\r\nin her grief; yet, having known a sister's sorrow myself, I could have\r\nnot leave her alone with her trouble in that strange place, without a\r\nword. So, feeling heart-sick, home-sick, and not knowing what else to\r\ndo, I just put my arms about her, and began to cry in a very helpless\r\nbut hearty way; for, as I seldom indulge in this moist luxury, I like\r\nto enjoy it with all my might, when I do.\r\n\r\nIt so happened I could not have done a better thing; for, though not a\r\nword was spoken, each felt the other's sympathy; and, in the silence,\r\nour handkerchiefs were more eloquent than words. She soon sobbed\r\nherself quiet; and, leaving her on my bed, I went back to work, feeling\r\nmuch refreshed by the shower, though I'd forgotten to rest, and had\r\nwashed my face instead of my hands. I mention this successful\r\nexperience as a receipt proved and approved, for the use of any nurse\r\nwho may find herself called upon to minister to these wounds of the\r\nheart. They will find it more efficacious than cups of tea,\r\nsmelling-bottles, psalms, or sermons; for a friendly touch and a\r\ncompanionable cry, unite the consolations of all the rest for\r\nwomankind; and, if genuine, will be found a sovereign cure for the\r\nfirst sharp pang so many suffer in these heavy times.\r\n\r\nI am gratified to find that my little Sergeant has found favor in\r\nseveral quarters, and gladly respond to sundry calls for news of him,\r\nthough my personal knowledge ended five months ago. Next to my good\r\nJohn--I hope the grass is green above him, far away there in\r\nVirginia!--I placed the Sergeant on my list of worthy boys; and many\r\njovial chat have I enjoyed with the merry-hearted lad, who had a fancy\r\nfor fun, when his poor arm was dressed. While Dr. P. poked and\r\nstrapped, I brushed the remains of the Sergeant's brown mane--shorn\r\nsorely against his will--and gossiped with all my might, the boy making\r\nodd faces, exclamations, and appeals, when nerves got the better of\r\nnonsense, as they sometimes did:\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather laugh than cry, when I must sing out anyhow, so just say\r\nthat bit from Dickens again, please, and I'll stand it like a man.\" He\r\ndid; for \"Mrs. Cluppins,\" \"Chadband,\" and \"Sam Weller,\" always helped\r\nhim through;  thereby causing me to lay another offering of love and\r\nadmiration on the shrine of the god of my idolatry, though he does wear\r\ntoo much jewelry and talk slang.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant also originated, I believe, the fashion of calling his\r\nneighbors by their afflictions instead of their names; and I was rather\r\ntaken aback by hearing them bandy remarks of this sort, with perfect\r\ngood humor and much enjoyment of the new game.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo, old Fits is off again!\" \"How are you, Rheumatiz?\" \"Will you\r\ntrade apples, Ribs?\" \"I say, Miss P., may I give Typus a drink of this?\"\r\n\"Look here, No Toes, lend us a stamp, there's a good feller,\" etc. He\r\nhimself was christened \"Baby B.,\" because he tended his arm on a little\r\npillow, and called it his infant.\r\n\r\nVery fussy about his grub was Sergeant B., and much trotting of\r\nattendants was necessary when he partook of nourishment. Anything more\r\nirresistibly wheedlesome I never saw, and constantly found myself\r\nindulging him, like the most weak-minded parent, merely for the\r\npleasure of seeing his blue eyes twinkle, his merry mouth break into a\r\nsmile, and his one hand execute a jaunty little salute that was\r\nentirely captivating. I am afraid that Nurse P. damaged her dignity,\r\nfrolicking with this persuasive young gentleman, though done for his\r\nwell-being. But \"boys will be boys,\" is perfectly applicable to the\r\ncase; for, in spite of years, sex, and the \"prunes-and-prisms\" doctrine\r\nlaid down for our use, I have a fellow feeling for lads, and always\r\nowed Fate a grudge because I wasn't a lord of creation instead of a\r\nlady.\r\n\r\nSince I left, I have heard, from a reliable source, that my Sergeant\r\nhas gone home; therefore, the small romance that budded the first day I\r\nsaw him, has blossomed into its second chapter; and I now imagine\r\n\"dearest Jane\" filling my place, tending the wounds I tended, brushing\r\nthe curly jungle I brushed, loving the excellent little youth I loved,\r\nand eventually walking altarward, with the Sergeant stumping gallantly\r\nat her side. If she doesn't do all this, and no end more, I'll never\r\nforgive her; and sincerely pray to the guardian saint of lovers, that\r\n\"Baby B.\" may prosper in his wooing, and his name be long in the land.\r\n\r\nOne of the lively episodes of hospital life, is the frequent marching\r\naway of such as are well enough to rejoin their regiments, or betake\r\nthemselves to some convalescent camp. The ward-master comes to the door\r\nof each room that is to be thinned, reads off a list of names, bids\r\ntheir owners look sharp and be ready when called for; and, as he\r\nvanishes, the rooms fall into an indescribable state of\r\ntopsy-turvyness, as the boys begin to black their boots, brighten\r\nspurs, if they have them, overhaul knapsacks, make presents; are fitted\r\nout with needfuls, and--well, why not?--kissed sometimes, as they say,\r\ngood bye; for in all human probability we shall never meet again, and a\r\nwoman's heart yearns over anything that has clung to her for help and\r\ncomfort. I never liked these breakings-up of my little household;\r\nthough my short stay showed me but three. I was immensely gratified by\r\nthe hand shakes I got, for their somewhat painful cordiality assured me\r\nthat I had not tried in vain. The big Prussian rumbled out his\r\nunintelligible adieux, with a grateful face and a premonitory smooth of\r\nhis yellow mustache, but got no farther, for some one else stepped up,\r\nwith a large brown hand extended, and this recommendation of our very\r\nfaulty establishment:\r\n\r\n\"We're off, ma'am, and I'm powerful sorry, for I'd no idea a 'orspittle\r\nwas such a jolly place. Hope I'll git another ball somewheres easy, so\r\nI'll come back, and be took care on again. Mean, ain't it?\"\r\n\r\nI didn't think so, but the doctrine of inglorious ease was not the\r\nright one to preach up, so I tried to look shocked, failed signally,\r\nand consoled myself by giving him the fat pincushion he had admired as\r\nthe \"cutest little machine agoin.\" Then they fell into line in front of\r\nthe house, looking rather wan and feeble, some of them, but trying to\r\nstep out smartly and march in good order, though half the knapsacks\r\nwere carried by the guard, and several leaned on sticks instead of\r\nshouldering guns. All looked up and smiled, or waved their hands and\r\ntouched their caps, as they passed under our windows down the long\r\nstreet, and so away, some to their homes in this world, and some to\r\nthat in the next; and, for the rest of the day, I felt like Rachel\r\nmourning for her children, when I saw the empty beds and missed the\r\nfamiliar faces.\r\n\r\nYou ask if nurses are obliged to witness amputations and such matters,\r\nas a part of their duty? I think not, unless they wish; for the patient\r\nis under the effects of ether, and needs no care but such as the\r\nsurgeons can best give. Our work begins afterward, when the poor soul\r\ncomes to himself, sick, faint, and wandering; full of strange pains and\r\nconfused visions, of disagreeable sensations and sights. Then we must\r\nsooth and sustain, tend and watch; preaching and practicing patience,\r\ntill sleep and time have restored courage and self-control.\r\n\r\nI witnessed several operations; for the height of my ambition was to go\r\nto the front after a battle, and feeling that the sooner I inured\r\nmyself to trying sights, the more useful I should be. Several of my\r\nmates shrunk from such things; for though the spirit was wholly\r\nwilling, the flesh was inconveniently weak. One funereal lady came to\r\ntry her powers as a nurse; but, a brief conversation eliciting the\r\nfacts that she fainted at the sight of blood, was afraid to watch\r\nalone, couldn't possibly take care of delirious persons, was nervous\r\nabout infections, and unable to bear much fatigue, she was mildly\r\ndismissed. I hope she found her sphere, but fancy a comfortable bandbox\r\non a high shelf would best meet the requirements of her case.\r\n\r\nDr. Z. suggested that I should witness a dissection; but I never\r\naccepted his invitations, thinking that my nerves belonged to the\r\nliving, not to the dead, and I had better finish my education as a\r\nnurse before I began that of a surgeon. But I never met the little man\r\nskipping through the hall, with oddly shaped cases in his hand, and an\r\nabsorbed expression of countenance, without being sure that a select\r\nparty of surgeons were at work in the dead house, which idea was a\r\nrather trying one, when I knew the subject was some person whom I had\r\nnursed and cared for.\r\n\r\nBut this must not lead any one to suppose that the surgeons were\r\nwillfully hard or cruel, though one of them remorsefully confided to me\r\nthat he feared his profession blunted his sensibilities, and perhaps,\r\nrendered him indifferent to the sight of pain.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that in some cases it does; for, though a\r\ncapital surgeon and a kindly man, Dr. P., through long acquaintance\r\nwith many of the ills flesh is heir to, had acquired a somewhat trying\r\nhabit of regarding a man and his wound as separate institutions, and\r\nseemed rather annoyed that the former should express any opinion upon\r\nthe latter, or claim any right in it, while under his care. He had a\r\nway of twitching off a bandage, and giving a limb a comprehensive sort\r\nof clutch, which though no doubt entirely scientific, was rather\r\nstartling than soothing, and highly objectionable as a means of\r\npreparing nerves for any fresh trial. He also expected the patient to\r\nassist in small operations, as he considered them, and to restrain all\r\ndemonstrations during the process.\r\n\r\n\"Here, my man, just hold it this way, while I look into it a bit,\" he\r\nsaid one day to Fitz G., putting a wounded arm into the keeping of a\r\nsound one, and proceeding to poke about among bits of bone and visible\r\nmuscles, in a red and black chasm made by some infernal machine of the\r\nshot or shell description. Poor Fitz held on like a grim Death, ashamed\r\nto show fear before a woman, till it grew more than he could bear in\r\nsilence; and, after a few smothered groans, he looked at me\r\nimploringly, as if he said, \"I wouldn't, ma'am, if I could help it,\"\r\nand fainted quietly away.\r\n\r\nDr. P. looked up, gave a compassionate sort of cluck, and poked away\r\nmore busily than ever, with a nod at me and a brief--\"Never mind; be so\r\ngood as to hold this till I finish.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed, cherishing the while a strong desire to insinuate a few of\r\nhis own disagreeable knives and scissors into him, and see how he liked\r\nit. A very disrespectful and ridiculous fancy, of course; for he was\r\ndoing all that could be done, and the arm prospered finely in his\r\nhands. But the human mind is prone to prejudice; and, though a\r\npersonable man, speaking French like a born \"Parley voo,\" and whipping\r\noff legs like an animated guillotine, I must confess to a sense of\r\nrelief when he was ordered elsewhere; and suspect that several of the\r\nmen would have faced a rebel battery with less trepidation than they\r\ndid Dr. P., when he came briskly in on his morning round.\r\n\r\nAs if to give us the pleasures of contrast, Dr. Z. succeeded him, who,\r\nI think, suffered more in giving pain than did his patients in enduring\r\nit; for he often paused to ask: \"Do I hurt you?\" and seeing his\r\nsolicitude, the boys invariably answered: \"Not much; go ahead, Doctor,\"\r\nthough the lips that uttered this amiable fib might be white with pain\r\nas they spoke. Over the dressing of some of the wounds, we used to\r\ncarry on conversations upon subjects foreign to the work in hand, that\r\nthe patient might forget himself in the charms of our discourse.\r\nChristmas eve was spent in this way; the Doctor strapping the little\r\nSergeant's arm, I holding the lamp, while all three laughed and talked,\r\nas if anywhere but in a hospital ward; except when the chat was broken\r\nby a long-drawn \"Oh!\" from \"Baby B.,\" an abrupt request from the Doctor\r\nto \"Hold the lamp a little higher, please,\" or an encouraging, \"Most\r\nthrough, Sergeant,\" from Nurse P.\r\n\r\nThe chief Surgeon, Dr. O., I was told, refused the higher salary,\r\ngreater honor, and less labor, of an appointment to the Officer's\r\nHospital, round the corner, that he might serve the poor fellows at\r\nHurly-burly House, or go to the front, working there day and night,\r\namong the horrors that succeed the glories of a battle. I liked that so\r\nmuch, that the quiet, brown-eyed Doctor was my especial admiration; and\r\nwhen my own turn came, had more faith in him than in all the rest put\r\ntogether, although he did advise me to go home, and authorize the\r\nconsumption of blue pills.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the surgeons reminds me that, having found all manner of\r\nfault, it becomes me to celebrate the redeeming feature of Hurly-burly\r\nHouse. I had been prepared by the accounts of others, to expect much\r\nhumiliation of spirit from the surgeons, and to be treated by them like\r\na door-mat, a worm, or any other meek and lowly article, whose mission\r\nit is to be put down and walked upon; nurses being considered as mere\r\nservants, receiving the lowest pay, and, it's my private opinion, doing\r\nthe hardest work of any part of the army, except the mules. Great,\r\ntherefore, was my surprise, when I found myself treated with the utmost\r\ncourtesy and kindness. Very soon my carefully prepared meekness was\r\nlaid upon the shelf; and, going from one extreme to the other, I more\r\nthan once expressed a difference of opinion regarding sundry messes it\r\nwas my painful duty to administer.\r\n\r\nAs eight of us nurses chanced to be off duty at once, we had an\r\nexcellent opportunity of trying the virtues of these gentlemen; and I\r\nam bound to say they stood the test admirably, as far as my personal\r\nobservation went. Dr. O.'s stethoscope was unremitting in its\r\nattentions; Dr. S. brought his buttons into my room twice a day, with\r\nthe regularity of a medical clock; while Dr. Z. filled my table with\r\nneat little bottles, which I never emptied, prescribed Browning,\r\nbedewed me with Cologne, and kept my fire going, as if, like the\r\ncandles in St. Peter's, it must never be permitted to die out. Waking,\r\none cold night, with the certainty that my last spark had pined away\r\nand died, and consequently hours of coughing were in store for me, I\r\nwas amazed to see a ruddy light dancing on the wall, a jolly blaze\r\nroaring up the chimney, and, down upon his knees before it, Dr. Z.,\r\nwhittling shavings. I ought to have risen up and thanked him on the\r\nspot; but, knowing that he was one of those who like to do good by\r\nstealth, I only peeped at him as if he were a friendly ghost; till,\r\nhaving made things as cozy as the most motherly of nurses could have\r\ndone, he crept away, leaving me to feel, as somebody says, \"as if\r\nangels were a watching of me in my sleep;\" though that species of wild\r\nfowl do not usually descend in broadcloth and glasses. I afterwards\r\ndiscovered that he split the wood himself on that cool January\r\nmidnight, and went about making or mending fires for the poor old\r\nladies in their dismal dens; thus causing himself to be felt--a bright\r\nand shining light in more ways than one. I never thanked him as I\r\nought; therefore, I publicly make a note of it, and further aggravate\r\nthat modest M.D. by saying that if this was not being the best of\r\ndoctors and the gentlest of gentlemen, I shall be happy to see any\r\nimprovement upon it.\r\n\r\nTo such as wish to know where these scenes took place, I must\r\nrespectfully decline to answer; for Hurly-burly House has ceased to\r\nexist as a hospital; so let it rest, with all its sins upon its\r\nhead,--perhaps I should say chimney top. When the nurses felt ill, the\r\ndoctors departed, and the patients got well, I believe the concern\r\ngently faded from existence, or was merged into some other and better\r\nestablishment, where I hope the washing of three hundred sick people is\r\ndone out of the house, the food is eatable, and mortal women are not\r\nexpected to possess an angelic exemption from all wants, and the\r\nendurance of truck horses.\r\n\r\nSince the appearance of these hasty Sketches, I have heard from several\r\nof my comrades at the Hospital; and their approval assures me that I\r\nhave not let sympathy and fancy run away with me, as that lively team\r\nis apt to do when harnessed to a pen. As no two persons see the same\r\nthing with the same eyes, my view of hospital life must be taken\r\nthrough my glass, and held for what it is worth. Certainly, nothing was\r\nset down in malice, and to the serious-minded party who objected to a\r\ntone of levity in some portions of the Sketches, I can only say that it\r\nis a part of my religion to look well after the cheerfulnesses of life,\r\nand let the dismals shift for themselves; believing, with good Sir\r\nThomas More, that it is wise to \"be merrie in God.\"\r\n\r\nThe next hospital I enter will, I hope, be one for the colored\r\nregiments, as they seem to be proving their right to the admiration and\r\nkind offices of their white relations, who owe them so large a debt, a\r\nlittle part of which I shall be so proud to pay.\r\n\r\n                                         Yours,\r\n                                            With a firm faith\r\n                                               In the good time coming,\r\n                                                 TRIBULATION PERIWINKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Publication.\r\n\r\nReady September 1.\r\n\r\nSpeeches, Lectures,\r\nand \r\nLetters:\r\nby\r\nWendell Phillips.\r\n\r\nFourth Edition.\r\n\r\nIn One Vol., crown octavo, pp. 570; printed on clear new type, and the\r\nbest tinted linen paper; bound in the English green or maroon\r\nvellum-cloth; with gilt tops, and illuminated title; and illustrated\r\nwith an excellent portrait of Mr. Phillips, on steel, by H. Wright\r\nSmith, of Boston.\r\n\r\nPrice $2,50.\r\n\r\nThe first three editions of this work were sold as rapidly as they could\r\nbe bound, and demand continues unabated.\r\n\r\nIn his Prospectus, the Publisher guaranteed to produce this work in the\r\nbest style of Boston manufacture; and that he amply redeemed this\r\npledge, the universal testimony of the Subscribers, the Agents, and the\r\nTrade attest. It was announced at $2, and intended to be of 500 pages.\r\nBut it is considerably larger, and more expensively gotten up than was\r\noriginally designed; and hence, and in order, by the last adornments, to\r\nmake it the very finest Book in the Boston market, its price has been\r\nnecessarily increased to $2.50.\r\n\r\nDue notice has been given to all Agents,--all their subscribers having\r\nbeen supplied at the price first announced,--no injustice is done to any\r\nparty by this increase in charge.\r\n\r\nBy mutual agreement, also, between the Publisher and his Agents, he is\r\nnow at liberty to offer the Book to the Trade, and will be ready to\r\nsupply cash orders at the shortest notice.\r\n\r\nThe following is a table of the\r\n                     Contents of the Volume:\r\nI.

A scanned\r\ncopy of this book is available through Hathitrust, courtesy of Duke\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nWe tried to preserve the original spelling of words, punctuation, and\r\nitalics in the Sketches. Changes to the text are listed below, in the\r\nDetailed Notes. The Detailed Notes includes other issues that have come\r\nup during the transcription of the text. In addition, we have added some\r\nnotes of explanation for some references in the text that, we hope, will\r\nhelp the reader.\r\n\r\nThe 1863 book was the first release of Hospital Sketches in book form.\r\nIn 1869, the Sketches were combined with nearly three hundred pages of\r\neight Camp and Fireside stories written by Miss Alcott. \r\n\r\nDetailed Notes\r\n\r\nNurse Sarah Gamp, a character from the novel Martin Chuzzlewit by\r\nCharles Dickens, was a stereotype of untrained and incompetent nurses of\r\nthe early Victorian era, before the reforms of Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nOn page 7, changed three page numbers in the Table of Contents: 10 to 9,\r\n64 to 66, and 84 to 86.\r\n\r\nOn page 12, Change never-come to never come in \"If I never-come back,\r\nmake a bonfire of them.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 14, being between Scylla and Charybdis is an idiom deriving from\r\nGreek mythology, meaning \"having to choose between two evils\".\r\n\r\nOn page 14, the Massachusetts governor in 1862 was John Albion Andrew.\r\n\r\nOn page 16, change Milk street to Milk Street in the clause \"and bore\r\ndown upon Milk street.\" This matches the spelling of two other\r\nreferences to Milk Street in the Sketches.\r\n\r\nEven today, the Koh-i-noor diamond mentioned on page 16 is considered\r\nthe most valuable diamond in the world.\r\n\r\nOn page 21, change Perewinkle to Periwinkle in the clause \"Nurse\r\nPerewinkle does exist.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 27, the Baltimore riot of April 19, 1861 was a civil conflict\r\nbetween Confederate sympathizers against members of out-of-state militia\r\n(primarily Massachusetts and some Pennsylvania men). The incident is\r\ncalled \"The First Bloodshed of the Civil War.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 34 transcribe door-ways with the hyphen, because the hyphen is\r\nfound in door-step, door-handles, and door-mat.\r\n\r\nOn page 42 add period after comfortable in the clause: \"was immensely\r\ncheering and comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 54, remove period after My in \"My. Ganymede departed.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 61, add comma after moment in the sentence: He seemed a little\r\nstartled at first, pondered over the fateful fact a moment then shook\r\nhis head, with a glance at the broad chest and muscular limbs stretched\r\nout before him:\r\n\r\nOn page 75, Henry Wilson was the Senator from Massachusetts from\r\n1855-1873.\r\n\r\nOn page 75, Preston Brooks beat Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner\r\nwith a cane on March 22, 1856, in retribution for an anti-Kansas speech\r\nby Sumner that attacked Andrew Butler, a relative of Brooks.\r\n\r\nOn page 77, Florence Nightingale ran the first group of organized female\r\nnurses to support the British Army in the Crimean War.\r\n\r\nOn page 79, Mark Tapley was a beloved character created by Charles\r\nDickens in his novel The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit.\r\n\r\nOn page 82, Aunt Chloe was a character from Uncle Tom's Cabin by Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe.\r\n\r\nOn Page 82-83, New Year's Day in 1863 was celebrated by abolitionists\r\nbecause Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation took effect on that day.\r\n\r\nOn Page 83, cosy is a variant of cozy, and we preserved this as it\r\nappeared in the original Sketches. The author did use cozy on page 47\r\nand page 100.\r\n\r\nOn page 89, transcribe Ward-master with the hyphen. The book typically\r\nused 'ward master.'\r\n\r\nOn page 93, three characters from the novels of Charles Dickens are\r\nmentioned: a) Mrs. Cluppins from The Pickwick Papers, b) Chadband, a\r\npompous preacher from Bleak House, and c) Sam Weller from The Pickwick\r\nPapers.\r\n\r\nOn page 95, change \"good by\" to \"good bye.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 96, changed \"waved hier hands\" to \"waved their hands.\"\r\n\r\nFour times in Chapter 6, the author omitted the hyphen in Hurly-burly\r\nHouse after using the hyphen with references to Hurly-burly House and\r\nHurly-burly Hotel in previous Chapters. Those four times occurred on\r\nPage 90, Page 99 (twice) and Page 101. We added the hyphen to the four\r\nitems in Chapter 6.",
