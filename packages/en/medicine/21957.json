Judging\r\nby the number of scientific treatises on the voice, the academic\r\nobserver would be led to believe that a coherent Science of Voice\r\nCulture has been evolved. Modern methods of instruction in singing are\r\npresumed to embody a system of exact and infallible rules for the\r\nmanagement of the voice. Teachers of singing in all the musical centers\r\nof Europe and America claim to follow a definite plan in the training of\r\nvoices, based on established scientific principles. But a practical\r\nacquaintance with the modern art of Voice Culture reveals the fact that\r\nthe laws of tone-production deduced from the scientific investigation of\r\nthe voice do not furnish a satisfactory basis for a method of training\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire vocal profession, among singers, teachers, and\r\nstudents alike, there is a general feeling of the insufficiency of\r\npresent knowledge of the voice. The problem of the correct management of\r\nthe vocal organs has not been finally and definitely solved. Voice\r\nCulture has not been reduced to an exact science. Vocal teachers are not\r\nin possession of an infallible method of training voices. Students of\r\nsinging find great difficulty in learning how to use their voices. Voice\r\nCulture is generally recognized as entitled to a position among the\r\nexact sciences; but something remains to be done before it can assume\r\nthat position.\r\n\r\nThere must be some definite reason for the failure of theoretical\r\ninvestigation to produce a satisfactory Science of Voice Culture. This\r\ncannot be due to any present lack of understanding of the vocal\r\nmechanism on the part of scientific students of the subject. The anatomy\r\nand physiology of the vocal organs have been exhaustively studied by a\r\nvast number of highly trained experts. So far as the muscular operations\r\nof tone-production are concerned, and the laws of acoustics bearing on\r\nthe vocal action, no new discovery can well be expected. But in this\r\nvery fact, the exhaustive attention paid to the mechanical operations\r\nof the voice, is seen the incompleteness of Vocal Science. Attention has\r\nbeen turned exclusively to the mechanical features of tone-production,\r\nand in consequence many important facts bearing on the voice have been\r\noverlooked.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the general acceptance of the doctrines of Vocal Science,\r\ntone-production has not really been studied from the purely scientific\r\nstandpoint. The use of the word \"science\" presupposes the careful\r\nobservation and study of all facts and phenomena bearing in any way on\r\nthe subject investigated. Viewed in this light, the scientific study of\r\nthe voice is at once seen to be incomplete. True, the use of the voice\r\nis a muscular operation, and a knowledge of the muscular structure of\r\nthe vocal organs is necessary to an understanding of the voice. But this\r\nknowledge alone is not sufficient. Like every other voluntary muscular\r\noperation, tone-production is subject to the psychological laws of\r\ncontrol and guidance. Psychology is therefore of equal importance with\r\nanatomy and acoustics as an element of Vocal Science.\r\n\r\nThere is also another line along which all previous investigation of\r\nthe voice is singularly incomplete. An immense fund of information about\r\nthe vocal action is obtained by attentive listening to voices, and in no\r\nother way. Yet this important element in Vocal Science is almost\r\ncompletely neglected.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at an assured basis for the art of Voice Culture, it\r\nis necessary in the first place to apply the strictest rules of\r\nscientific investigation to the study of the voice. A definite plan must\r\nbe adopted, to include every available source information. First, the\r\ninsight into the operations of the voice, obtained by listening to\r\nvoices, must be reviewed and analyzed. Second, the sciences of anatomy,\r\nmechanics, acoustics, and psychology must each contribute its share to\r\nthe general fund of information. Third, from all the facts thus brought\r\ntogether the general laws of vocal control and management must be\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\nBefore undertaking this exhaustive analysis of the vocal action it is\r\nadvisable to review in detail every method of instruction in singing now\r\nin vogue. This may seem a very difficult task. To the casual observer\r\nconditions in the vocal world appear truly chaotic. Almost every\r\nprominent teacher believes himself to possess a method peculiarly his\r\nown; it would not be easy to find two masters who agree on every point,\r\npractical as well as theoretical. But this confusion of methods is only\r\non the surface. All teachers draw the materials of their methods from\r\nthe same sources. An outline of the history of Voice Culture, including\r\nthe rise of the old Italian school and the development of Vocal Science,\r\nwill render the present situation in the vocal profession sufficiently\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nPart I of this work contains a review of modern methods. In Part II a\r\ncritical analysis is offered of certain theories of the vocal action\r\nwhich receive much attention in practical instruction. Several of the\r\naccepted doctrines of Vocal Science, notably those of breath-control,\r\nchest and nasal resonance, and forward placing of the tone, are found on\r\nexamination to contain serious fallacies. More important even than the\r\nspecific errors involved in these doctrines, the basic principle of\r\nmodern Voice Culture is also found to be false. All methods are based on\r\nthe theory that the voice requires to be directly and consciously\r\nmanaged in the performance of its muscular operations. When tested by\r\nthe psychological laws of muscular guidance, this theory of mechanical\r\ntone-production is found to be a complete error.\r\n\r\nPart III contains a summary of all present knowledge of the voice.\r\nFirst, the insight into the singer's vocal operations is considered,\r\nwhich the hearer obtains by attentive listening to the tones produced.\r\nThis empirical knowledge, as it is generally called, indicates a state\r\nof unnecessary throat tension as the cause, or at any rate the\r\naccompaniment, of every faulty tone. Further, an outline is given of all\r\nscientific knowledge of the voice. The anatomy of the vocal organs, and\r\nthe acoustic and mechanical principles of the vocal action, are briefly\r\ndescribed. Finally, the psychological laws of tone-production are\r\nconsidered. It is seen that under normal conditions the voice\r\ninstinctively obeys the commands of the ear.\r\n\r\nIn Part IV the information about the vocal action obtained from the two\r\nsources is combined,--the scientific knowledge of mechanical processes,\r\nand the empirical knowledge derived from attentive listening to voices.\r\nThroat stiffness is then seen to be the one influence which can\r\ninterfere with the instinctively correct action of the voice. The most\r\nimportant cause of throat stiffness is found in the attempt consciously\r\nto manage the mechanical operations of the voice. In place of the\r\nerroneous principles of mechanical instruction, imitation is seen to be\r\nthe rational foundation of a method of Voice Culture. The mystery\r\nsurrounding the old Italian method is dispelled so soon as the\r\npossibility is recognized of teaching singing by imitation. Practical\r\nrules are outlined for imparting and acquiring the correct use of the\r\nvoice, through the guidance of the sense of hearing. The singer's\r\neducation is considered in its broadest sense, and training in\r\ntone-production is assigned to its proper place in the complex scheme of\r\nVoice Culture.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years the author has found opportunity to hear\r\nmost of the famous singers who have visited America, as well as a host\r\nof artists of somewhat lesser fame. In his early student days the\r\nconviction grew that the voice cannot reach its fullest development when\r\nmechanically used. Siegfried does not forge his sword, and at the same\r\ntime think of his diaphragm or soft palate. Lucia cannot attend to the\r\nmovements of her arytenoid cartilages while pouring out the trills and\r\nruns of her Mad Scene. A study of the theoretical works on Vocal\r\nScience, dealing always with mechanical action and never with tone,\r\nserved only to strengthen this conviction. Finally the laws of\r\nphysiological psychology were found to confirm this early belief.\r\n\r\nEvery obtainable work on Voice Culture has been included in the author's\r\nreading. No desire must be understood to make a display of the results\r\nof this study. One citation from a recognized authority, or in some\r\ncases two or three, is held sufficient to verify each statement\r\nregarding the accepted doctrines of Vocal Science. As for the practical\r\nfeatures of modern methods, the facts alleged cannot in every case be\r\nsubstantiated by references to published works. It is, however, believed\r\nthat the reader's acquaintance with the subject will bear out the\r\nauthor's statements.\r\n\r\nThis work is of necessity academic in conception and in substance. Its\r\nonly purpose is to demonstrate the falsity of the idea of mechanical\r\nvocal management, and to prove the scientific soundness of instruction\r\nby imitation. There is no possibility of a practical manual of\r\ninstruction in singing being accepted, based on the training of the ear\r\nand the musical education of the singer, until the vocal world has been\r\nconvinced of the error of the mechanical idea. When that has been\r\naccomplished this work will have served its purpose. All of the\r\ncontroversial materials, together with much of the theoretical subject\r\nmatter, will then be superfluous. A concise practical treatise can then\r\nbe offered, containing all that the vocal teacher and the student of\r\nsinging need to know about the training and management of the voice.\r\n\r\nIt is in great measure due to the coöperation of my dear friend, Charles\r\nLeonard-Stuart, that my theory of voice production is brought into\r\nliterary form, and presented in this book. To his thorough musicianship,\r\nhis skill and experience as a writer of English, and especially to his\r\nmastery of the bookman's art, I am deeply indebted. True as I know\r\nLeonard-Stuart's love to be for the art of pure singing, I yet prefer to\r\nascribe his unselfish interest in this work to his friendship for the\r\nauthor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nMODERN METHODS OF INSTRUCTION IN SINGING\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTone-Production and Voice Culture\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBreathing and Breath-Control\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRegisters and Laryngeal Action\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nResonance\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEmpirical Materials of Modern Methods\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA General View of Modern Voice Culture\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF MODERN METHODS\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMechanical Vocal Management as the Basis of Voice Culture\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Fallacy of the Doctrine of Breath-Control\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThe Fallacies of Forward Emission, Chest Resonance, and\r\nNasal Resonance\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Futility of the Materials of Modern Methods\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nThe Error of the Theory of Mechanical Vocal Management\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTHE BASIS OF A REAL SCIENCE OF VOICE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe Means of Empirical Observation of the Voice\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSympathetic Sensations of Vocal Tone\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEmpirical Knowledge of the Voice\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe Empirical Precepts of the Old Italian School\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEmpirical Knowledge in Modern Voice Culture\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nScientific Knowledge of the Voice\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nVOCAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICAL VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nThe Correct Vocal Action\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nThe Causes of Throat Stiffness and of Incorrect Vocal Action\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nThroat Stiffness and Incorrect Singing\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nThe True Meaning of Vocal Training\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nImitation the Rational Basis of Voice Culture\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Old Italian Method\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nThe Disappearance of the Old Italian Method and the Development\r\nof Mechanical Instruction\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nThe Materials of Rational Instruction in Singing\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOutlines of a Practical Method of Voice Culture\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTONE-PRODUCTION AND VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no other form of expression do art and nature seem so closely\r\nidentified as in the art of singing. A perfect voice speaks so directly\r\nto the soul of the hearer that all appearance of artfully prepared\r\neffect is absent. Every tone sung by a consummate vocal artist seems to\r\nbe poured forth freely and spontaneously. There is no evidence of\r\ncalculation, of carefully directed effort, of attention to the workings\r\nof the voice, in the tones of a perfect singer. Yet if the accepted idea\r\nof Voice Culture is correct, this semblance of spontaneity in the use of\r\nthe voice can result only from careful and incessant attention to\r\nmechanical rules. That the voice must be managed or handled in some way\r\nneither spontaneous nor instinctive, is the settled conviction of almost\r\nevery authority on the subject. All authorities believe also that this\r\nmanner of handling the voice must be acquired by every student of\r\nsinging, in the course of carefully directed study.\r\n\r\nThis training in the use of the voice is the most important feature of\r\neducation in singing. Voice Culture embraces a peculiar and distinct\r\nproblem, that of the correct management of the vocal organs. Vocal\r\ntraining has indeed come to be considered synonymous with training in\r\nthe correct use of the voice. Every method of instruction in singing\r\nmust contain as its most important element some means for dealing with\r\nthe problem of tone-production.\r\n\r\nNo complete and satisfactory solution of this problem has ever been\r\nfound. Of this fact every one acquainted with the practical side of\r\nVoice Culture must be well aware. As the present work is designed solely\r\nto suggest a new manner of dealing with this question, it is advisable\r\nto define precisely what is meant by the problem of tone-production.\r\n\r\nIn theory the question may be stated very simply. It is generally\r\nbelieved throughout the vocal profession that the voice has one correct\r\nmode of action, different from a wide variety of incorrect actions of\r\nwhich it is capable;--that this mode of action, though ordained by\r\nNature, is not in the usual sense natural or instinctive;--that the\r\ncorrect vocal action must be acquired, through a definite understanding\r\nand conscious management of the muscular movements involved. The\r\ntheoretical problem therefore is: What is the correct vocal action, and\r\nhow can it be acquired?\r\n\r\nOn the practical side, the nature of the problem is by no means so\r\nsimple. In actual instruction in singing, the subject of vocal\r\nmanagement cannot readily be dissociated from the wide range of other\r\ntopics comprised in the singer's education. In much that pertains to the\r\nart of music, the singer's training must include the same subjects that\r\nform the training of every musician. In addition to this general musical\r\ntraining, about the same for all students of music, each student must\r\nacquire technical command of the chosen instrument. This is necessarily\r\nacquired by practice on the instrument, whether it be piano, violin,\r\noboe, or whatever else. In the same way, vocal technique is acquired by\r\npractice in actual singing. Practice makes perfect, with the voice as\r\nwith everything else.\r\n\r\nBut the voice is not invariably subject to the law that practice makes\r\nperfect. In this important respect the singer's education presents a\r\nproblem not encountered by the student of any instrument. Given the\r\nnecessary talents, industry, and opportunities for study, the student of\r\nthe violin may count with certainty on acquiring the mastery of this\r\ninstrument. But for the vocal student this is not necessarily true.\r\nThere are many cases in which practice in singing does not bring about\r\ntechnical perfection. The mere singing of technical exercises is not\r\nenough; it is of vital importance that the exercises be sung in some\r\nparticular manner. There is one certain way in which the voice must be\r\nhandled during the practice of singing. If the vocal organs are\r\nexercised in this particular manner, the voice will improve steadily as\r\nthe result of practice. This progress will continue until perfect\r\ntechnical command of the voice is acquired. But if the vocal student\r\nfails to hit upon this particular way of handling the voice in practice\r\nthe voice will improve little, or not at all. In such a case perfect\r\nvocal technique will never be acquired, no matter how many years the\r\npractice may continue.\r\n\r\nWhat is this peculiar way in which the voice must be handled during the\r\npractice of singing? This is the practical problem of tone-production,\r\nas it confronts the student of singing.\r\n\r\nIt is important that the exact bearing of the problem be clearly\r\nunderstood. It is purely a feature of education in singing, and concerns\r\nonly teachers and students of the art. Properly speaking, the finished\r\nsinger should leave the teacher and start on the artistic career,\r\nequipped with a voice under perfect control. There should be no problem\r\nof tone-production for the trained singer, no thought or worry about the\r\nvocal action. True, many authorities on the voice maintain that the\r\nartist must, in all singing, consciously and intelligently guide the\r\noperations of the vocal organs. But even if this be the case the fact\r\nremains that this ability to manage the voice must be acquired during\r\nstudent days. In seeking a solution of the problem, that period in the\r\nprospective singer's training must be considered during which the proper\r\nuse of the voice is learned.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken for granted that teachers of singing have always been\r\naware of the existence of the problem of tone-production, and have\r\nalways instructed their pupils in the correct management of the voice.\r\nYet it is only within the past hundred and fifty years that vocal\r\nmanagement has been the subject of special study. A brief review of the\r\nhistory of Voice Culture will serve to bring this fact out clearly.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the present art of singing is of comparatively recent\r\norigin. It is indeed probable that man had been using the voice in\r\nsomething akin to song for thousands of years before the dawn of\r\nhistory. Song of some kind has always played an important part in human\r\nlife, savage as well as civilized. To express our emotions and feelings\r\nby means of the voice is one of our most deep-seated instincts. For this\r\nuse of the voice to take on the character of melody, as distinguished\r\nfrom ordinary speech, is also purely instinctive. Singing was one of the\r\nmost zealously cultivated arts in early Egypt, in ancient Israel, and in\r\nclassic Greece and Rome. Throughout all the centuries of European\r\nhistory singing has always had its recognized place, both in the\r\nservices of the various churches and in the daily life of the people.\r\n\r\nBut solo singing, as we know it to-day, is a comparatively modern art.\r\nNot until the closing decades of the sixteenth century did the art of\r\nsolo singing receive much attention, and it is to that period we must\r\nlook for the beginnings of Voice Culture. It is true that the voice was\r\ncultivated, both for speech and song, among the Greeks and Romans.\r\nGordon Holmes, in his _Treatise on Vocal Physiology and Hygiene_\r\n(London, 1879), gives an interesting account of these ancient systems of\r\nVoice Culture. But practically nothing has come down to us about the\r\nmeans then used for training the voice. Even if any defined methods were\r\ndeveloped, it is absolutely certain that these had no influence on the\r\nmodern art of Voice Culture.\r\n\r\nWith the birth of Italian opera, in 1600, a new art of singing also came\r\ninto existence. The two arts, opera and singing, developed side by side,\r\neach dependent on the other. And most important to the present inquiry,\r\nthe art or science of training voices also came into being. In _Le\r\nRevoluzioni del Teatro Musicale Italiano_ (Venice, 1785), Arteaga says\r\nof the development of opera: \"But nothing contributed so much to clarify\r\nItalian music at that time as the excellence and the abundance of the\r\nsingers.\" A race of singing masters seems almost to have sprung up in\r\nItaly. These illustrious masters taught the singers to produce effects\r\nwith their voices such as had never been heard of before. From 1600 to\r\n1750 the progress of the art of singing was uninterrupted. Each great\r\nteacher carried the art a little further, discovering new beauties and\r\npowers in the voice, and finding means to impart his new knowledge to\r\nhis pupils.\r\n\r\nThis race of teachers is known to-day as the Old Italian School, and\r\ntheir system of instruction is called the Old Italian Method. Just what\r\nthis method consisted of is a much-discussed question. Whatever its\r\nsystem of instruction, the old Italian school seems to have suffered a\r\ngradual decline. In 1800 it was distinctly on the wane; it was entirely\r\nsuperseded, during the years from 1840 to 1865, by the modern scientific\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a practical system of Voice Culture, the old Italian\r\nmethod is a highly mysterious subject. Little is now known about the\r\nmeans used for training students of singing in the correct use of the\r\nvoice. This much is fairly certain: the old masters paid little or no\r\nattention to what are now considered scientific principles. They taught\r\nin what modern vocal theorists consider a rather haphazard fashion. The\r\nterm \"empirical\" is often applied to their method, and to the knowledge\r\nof the voice on which it was based.[1] But as to what the old masters\r\nactually knew about the voice, and just how they taught their pupils to\r\nsing, on these points the modern world is in almost complete ignorance.\r\nMany attempts have been made in recent years to reconstruct the old\r\nItalian method in the light of modern scientific knowledge of the voice.\r\nBut no such analysis of the empirical system has ever been convincing.\r\n\r\n[Note 1: \"The old Italian method of instruction, to which vocal\r\nmusic owed its high condition, was purely empirical.\" (Emma Seiler, _The\r\nVoice in Singing_. Phila., 1886.)]\r\n\r\nHow the practical method of the old masters came to be forgotten is\r\nperhaps the most mysterious feature of this puzzling system. There has\r\nbeen a lineal succession of teachers of singing, from the earlier\r\ndecades of the eighteenth century down to the present. Even to-day it is\r\nalmost unheard of that any one should presume to call himself a teacher\r\nof singing without having studied with at least one recognized master.\r\nEach master of the old school imparted his knowledge and his practical\r\nmethod to his pupils. Those of his pupils who in their turn became\r\nteachers passed the method on to their students, and so on, in many\r\nunbroken successions. Yet, for some mysterious reason, the substance of\r\nthe old method was lost in transmission.\r\n\r\nWhat little is now known about the old method is derived from two\r\nsources, the written record and tradition. To write books in explanation\r\nof their system of instruction does not seem to have occurred to the\r\nearliest exponents of the art of Voice Culture. The first published work\r\non the subject was that of Pietro Francesco Tosi, _Osservazione sopra il\r\nCanto figurato_, brought out in Bologna in 1723. This was translated\r\ninto English by M. Galliard, and published in London in 1742; a German\r\ntranslation by J. F. Agricola was issued in 1757. The present work will\r\ncall for several citations from Tosi, all taken from the English\r\nedition. Only one other prominent teacher of the old school, G. B.\r\nMancini, has left an apparently complete record of his method. His\r\n_Riflessioni pratiche sul Canto figurato_ was published in Milan in\r\n1776. Mancini's book has never been translated into English. Reference\r\nwill therefore be made to the third Italian edition, brought out in\r\nMilan, 1777.\r\n\r\nTosi and Mancini undoubtedly intended to give complete accounts of the\r\nmethods of instruction in singing in vogue in their day. But modern\r\nvocal theorists generally believe that the most important materials of\r\ninstruction were for some reason not mentioned. Three registers are\r\nmentioned by Tosi, while Mancini speaks of only two. Both touch on the\r\nnecessity of equalizing the registers, but give no specific directions\r\nfor this purpose. About all these early writers have left us, in the\r\nopinion of most modern students of their works, is the outline of an\r\nelaborate system of vocal ornaments and embellishments.\r\n\r\nOn the side of tradition a slightly more coherent set of rules has come\r\ndown to us from the old masters. These are generally known as the\r\n\"traditional precepts.\" Just when the precepts were first formulated it\r\nis impossible to say. Tosi and Mancini do not mention them. Perhaps they\r\nwere held by the old masters as a sort of esoteric mystery; this idea is\r\noccasionally put forward. At any rate, by the time the traditional\r\nprecepts were given to the world in published works on the voice, their\r\nvaluable meaning had been completely lost.\r\n\r\nGathered from all available sources, the traditional precepts are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Sing on the breath.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sing the tone forward,\" or \"at the lips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Support the tone.\"\r\n\r\nTo the layman these precepts are so vague as to be almost\r\nunintelligible. But modern vocal teachers are convinced that the\r\nprecepts sum up the most important means used by the old masters for\r\nimparting the correct vocal action. An interpretation of the precepts in\r\nterms intelligible to the modern student would therefore be extremely\r\nvaluable. Many scientific investigators of the voice have sought\r\nearnestly to discover the sense in which the precepts were applied by\r\nthe old masters. These explanations of the traditional precepts occupy a\r\nvery important position in most modern methods of instruction.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that the old masters were highly successful\r\nteachers of singing. Even leaving out of consideration the vocal\r\nachievements of the castrati, the singers of Tosi's day must have been\r\nable to perform music of the florid style in a masterly fashion. This is\r\nplainly seen from a study of the scores of the operas popular at that\r\ntime. Empirical methods of instruction seem to have sufficed for the\r\nearlier masters. Not until the old method had been in existence for\r\nnearly one hundred and fifty years does an attempt seem to have been\r\nmade to study the voice scientifically. In 1741 a famous French\r\nphysician, Ferrein, published a treatise on the vocal organs. This was\r\nthe first scientific work to influence the practices of vocal teachers.\r\n\r\nFor many years after the publication of Ferrein's treatise, the\r\nscientific study of the voice attracted very little attention from the\r\nsinging masters. Fully sixty years elapsed before any serious attempt\r\nwas made to base a method of instruction on scientific principles. Even\r\nthen the idea of scientific instruction in singing gained ground very\r\nslowly. Practical teachers at first paid but little attention to the\r\nsubject. Interest in the mechanics of voice production was confined\r\nalmost entirely to the scientists.\r\n\r\nIn the early decades of the nineteenth century the mechanical features\r\nof voice production seem to have appealed to a constantly wider circle\r\nof scientists. Lickovius (1814), Malgaine (1831), Bennati (1830), Bell\r\n(1832), Savart (1825), brought out works on the subject. It remained,\r\nhowever, for a vocal teacher, Garcia, to conceive the idea of basing\r\npractical instruction on scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\nManuel Garcia (1805-1906) may justly be regarded as the founder of Vocal\r\nScience. His father, Manuel del Popolo Viscenti, was famous as singer,\r\nimpresario, and teacher. From him Garcia inherited the old method, it is\r\nsafe to assume, in its entirety. But for Garcia's remarkable mind the\r\nempirical methods of the old school were unsatisfactory. He desired\r\ndefinite knowledge of the voice. A clear idea seems to have been in his\r\nmind that, with full understanding of the vocal mechanism and of its\r\ncorrect mode of action, voices would be more readily and surely trained.\r\nHow strongly this idea had possession of Garcia is shown by the fact\r\nthat he began the study of the vocal action in 1832, and that he\r\ninvented the laryngoscope only in 1855.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood that Garcia was the first teacher to attempt\r\nto formulate a systematic scheme of instruction in singing. In the\r\nworks of Mannstein (1834) and of Marx (1823) an ambitious forward\r\nmovement on the part of many prominent teachers is strongly indicated.\r\nBut Garcia was the first teacher to apply scientific principles in\r\ndealing with the specific problem of tone-production. He conceived the\r\nidea that a scientific knowledge of the workings of the vocal organs\r\nmight be made the basis of a practical system or method of instruction\r\nin singing. This idea of Garcia has been the basic principle of all\r\npractical methods, ever since the publication of the results of his\r\nfirst laryngoscopic investigations in 1855.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to suggest a new means of dealing with the problem of\r\nvocal management, it is well to ascertain how this problem is treated in\r\nmodern methods of instruction. It would not be easy to overstate the\r\nimportance assigned to the matter of tone-production in all modern\r\nsystems of Voice Culture. The scientific study of the voice has dealt\r\nexclusively with this subject. A new science has resulted, commonly\r\ncalled \"Vocal Science.\" This science is generally accepted as the\r\nfoundation of all instruction in singing. All modern methods are to\r\nsome extent based on Vocal Science.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at an understanding of modern methods, the two directions in\r\nwhich vocal theorists have approached the scientific study of the voice\r\nmust be borne in mind: First, by an investigation of the anatomy of the\r\nvocal organs, and of the laws of acoustics and mechanics in accordance\r\nwith which they operate. Second, by an analysis of the traditional\r\nprecepts of the old Italian school in the light of this scientific\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAs the present work demands a review of modern methods from the\r\npractical side only, it is not necessary to include a description of the\r\nvocal organs. It will be sufficient to describe briefly the manner in\r\nwhich scientific investigators of the voice treat the subject of the\r\nvocal organs.\r\n\r\nThe vocal mechanism consists of three portions,--the breathing\r\napparatus, the larynx with its appendages, and the resonance cavities.\r\nVocal scientists apply their efforts to finding out the correct mode of\r\naction of each portion of the mechanism, and to formulating rules and\r\nexercises by which these correct actions can be acquired and combined\r\nfor the production of perfect tones. The analysis of the traditional\r\nprecepts also conforms to this general plan; each precept is referred to\r\nthat portion of the vocal apparatus to which it seems best to apply. The\r\noutline of the principles of modern methods contained in the following\r\nchapters follows this general scheme.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood at the start that on most of the doctrines\r\nincluded in Vocal Science there is no unanimity of opinion among either\r\ntheorists or teachers. Far from this being the case, practically all the\r\nprinciples of Vocal Science are the subjects of controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nBREATHING AND BREATH-CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered that, as the breath is the foundation of\r\nsinging, the manner of breathing is of vital importance to the singer.\r\nThis subject has therefore received a vast amount of attention from\r\nvocal scientists, and the muscular actions of breathing have been\r\nexhaustively studied.\r\n\r\nSeveral sets of rules for inspiration and expiration are put forth by\r\ndifferent authorities. But there is no occasion for going into a\r\ndetailed discussion of the different modes of breathing advocated by the\r\nvarious schools, or of the theoretical arguments which each advances. It\r\nis sufficient to say that the modes of breathing most in vogue are five\r\nin number,--deep abdominal, lateral or costal, fixed high chest,\r\nclavicular, and diaphragmatic-abdominal. However, on experimenting with\r\nthese five systems of breathing, it is found that the number may be\r\nreduced to two; of these the others are but slight modifications. In\r\none system of inspiration the abdomen is protruded, while the upper\r\nchest is held firm, the greatest expansion being at the base of the\r\nlungs. In the other mode of taking breath the abdomen is slightly drawn\r\nin, while the chest is expanded in every direction, upward, laterally,\r\nforward, and backward. In this system the upper chest is held in a fixed\r\nand high position.\r\n\r\nNecessarily the manner of filling the lungs involves the manner in which\r\nthey are emptied. Opinions are practically unanimous as to the proper\r\nposition of the singer before taking breath, that is, at the end of an\r\nexpiration. The singer must stand erect, the weight of the body evenly\r\nsupported on the balls of both feet, with the whole body in a condition\r\nof lithe suppleness. In both systems of breathing the manner of\r\nexpiration is simply a return to this position.\r\n\r\nA wide variety of breathing exercises are in use, but these do not\r\nrequire detailed description. Any one of the prescribed systems of\r\nbreathing can easily be adopted, and the student of singing seldom\r\nencounters any difficulty on this point. Still most teachers attach\r\ngreat importance to the acquirement of the correct manner of breathing.\r\nToneless mechanical exercises are generally given, by which the student\r\nis expected to master the muscular movements before applying in singing\r\nthe system advocated by the teacher. These exercises are usually\r\ncombined with those for breath-control, and they are described under\r\nthat head.\r\n\r\n_Breath-Control_\r\n\r\nVery early in the development of Vocal Science the management of the\r\nbreath began to receive attention. Mannstein,[2] writing in 1834, says:\r\n\"The air in expiration must stream from the chest slowly and without\r\nshock. The air must flow from the chest with the tone.\" In a footnote he\r\nadds: \"In order to acquire this economy of the breath, students were\r\nrequired to practise daily, without singing, to take and to hold back\r\nthe breath as long as possible.\" Mannstein does not mention the muscular\r\naction involved in this exercise.\r\n\r\n[Note 2: _Die grosse italienische Gesangschule._ Dresden, 1834.]\r\n\r\nThis subject is also touched upon by Garcia. In the first edition of his\r\n_École de Garcia_, 1847, Chap. IV, p. 14, he says: \"The mechanism of\r\nexpiration consists of a gentle pressure on the lungs charged with air,\r\noperated by the thorax and the diaphragm. The shock of the chest, the\r\nsudden falling of the ribs, and the quick relaxing of the diaphragm\r\ncause the air to escape instantly.... If, while the lungs are filled\r\nwith air, the ribs are allowed to fall, and the diaphragm to rise, the\r\nlungs instantly give up the inspired air, like a pressed sponge. It is\r\nnecessary therefore to allow the ribs to fall and the diaphragm to relax\r\nonly so much as is required to sustain the tones.\" It may be questioned\r\nwhether Garcia had in mind the doctrine of breath-control as this is\r\nunderstood to-day. Very little attention was paid, at any rate, in the\r\nvocal instruction of that day, to the mechanical actions of\r\nbreath-control; the great majority of teachers probably had never heard\r\nof this principle.\r\n\r\nAs a definite principle of Vocal Science, breath-control was first\r\nformulated by Dr. Mandl, in his _Die Gesundheitslehre der Stimme_,\r\nBrunswick, 1876. From that time on, this doctrine has been very\r\ngenerally recognized as the fundamental principle of correct singing.\r\nPractically every scientific writer on the voice since then states\r\nbreath-control as one of the basic principles of Vocal Science. The most\r\ninfluential published work in popularizing the doctrine of\r\nbreath-control was probably the book written jointly by Lennox Browne\r\nand Emil Behnke, _Voice, Song, and Speech_, London, 1883.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is of so much importance in Vocal Science and in modern\r\nmethods of instruction as to require a detailed explanation. The theory\r\nof breath-control may be stated as follows:[3]\r\n\r\n\"In ordinary breathing the air is expelled from the lungs quietly, but\r\nrapidly; at no point of the breathing apparatus does the expired breath\r\nmeet with resistance. In singing, on the contrary, the expiratory\r\npressure is much more powerful, yet the expiration must be much slower.\r\nFurthermore, all the expired breath must be converted into tone, and the\r\nsinger must have perfect control over the strength and the speed of the\r\nexpiration. This requires that the air be held back at some point. The\r\naction of holding back the breath must not be performed by the muscles\r\nwhich close the glottis, for all the muscles of the larynx are very\r\nsmall and weak in comparison with the powerful muscles of expiration.\r\nThe glottis-closing muscles are too weak to oppose their action to the\r\nforce of a powerful expiration. If the vocal cords are called upon to\r\nwithstand a strong breath pressure, they are seriously strained, and\r\ntheir proper action is rendered impossible. In the same way, if the\r\nthroat be narrowed at any point above the larynx, so as to present a\r\npassage small enough to hold back a powerful expiration, the entire\r\nvocal mechanism is strained and forced out of its proper adjustment. The\r\nsinger must have perfect control of the breath, and at the same time\r\nrelieve the larynx and throat of all pressure and strain. To obtain this\r\ncontrol the singer must govern the expiration by means of the muscles of\r\ninspiration. When the lungs are filled the inspiratory muscles are not\r\nto be relaxed as in ordinary breathing, but are to be held on tension\r\nthroughout the action of expiration. Whatever pressure is exerted by the\r\nexpiratory muscles must be almost counterbalanced by the opposed action\r\nof the muscles of inspiration. The more powerful the blast, the greater\r\nmust be the exertion by which it is controlled. In this way the singer\r\nmay have perfect control both of the speed and of the strength of the\r\nexpiration.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 3: This statement of the doctrine of breath-control must not\r\nbe construed as an endorsement of the theory of the vocal action\r\nembodied in this doctrine. On the contrary, both the theory of \"opposed\r\naction\" breath-control and the \"breath-band\" theory are held to be\r\nutterly erroneous. For a further discussion of this subject see Chapter\r\nII of Part II.]\r\n\r\nThe exercises for acquiring command of this \"opposed action\r\nbreath-control\" are easily understood; indeed, they will readily suggest\r\nthemselves to one who has grasped their purpose. Most important of these\r\nexercises is a quick inspiration, followed by a slow and controlled\r\nexpiration. Exercises for breathing and breath-control are usually\r\ncombined; the student is instructed to take breath in the manner\r\nadvocated by the teacher, and then to control the expiration.\r\n\r\nTeachers usually require their pupils to obtain command of this action\r\nas a toneless exercise before permitting them to apply it to the\r\nproduction of tone. Methods vary greatly as to the length of time\r\ndevoted to toneless drills in breathing and breath-control. Many\r\nteachers demand that students practise these exercises daily throughout\r\nthe entire course of study, and even recommend that this practice be\r\ncontinued throughout the singer's active life.\r\n\r\nSimple as these exercises are in theory, they demand very arduous\r\npractice. Control of the breath by \"opposed action\" is hard and tiring\r\nmuscular work, as the reader may easily convince himself by practising\r\nthe above described exercise for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nNo special rules are needed for applying this mode of breathing to the\r\nproduction of tone. Theoretical writers generally do not claim that the\r\ncontrol of the breath brings about the correct laryngeal action, but\r\nmerely that it permits this action by noninterference. Several\r\nauthorities however, notably Shakespeare, maintain that in effect this\r\nsystem of breath-control embodies the old precept, \"Sing on the breath.\"\r\n(Wm. Shakespeare, _The Art of Singing_, London, 1898, p. 24.) Other\r\ntheorists hold that the empirical precept, \"Support the tone,\" refers to\r\nthis manner of controlled expiration. (G. B. Lamperti, _The Technics of\r\nBel Canto_, Trans. by Dr. Th. Baker, N. Y., 1905, p. 9.)\r\n\r\n_The \"Breath-band\" System_\r\n\r\nWhile most authorities on the voice advocate the system of\r\nbreath-control by \"opposed muscular action,\" there are a number of\r\nmasters who teach an entirely different system. This is usually known as\r\nthe \"Breath-band,\" or \"Ventricular\" breath-control. Charles Lunn, in\r\n_The Philosophy of the Voice_, 1878, was the first to propound the\r\ntheory that the breath may be controlled by the false vocal cords. There\r\nis reason to believe that this idea was also worked out independently by\r\nOrlando Steed (\"On Beauty of Touch and Tone,\" _Proceedings of the\r\nMusical Assn._, 1879-80, p. 47). As a number of prominent teachers base\r\ntheir entire methods on this theory, it is worthy of careful attention.\r\nThe \"breath-band\" theory may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n\"When the lungs are filled by a deep inspiration and the breath is held,\r\nthe glottis is of necessity closed so tightly that no air can escape. In\r\nthis condition the expiratory muscles may be very violently contracted,\r\nand still no air will escape; indeed, the greater the strength exerted\r\nthe tighter is the closure of the glottis. Obviously, this closure of\r\nthe glottis cannot be effected by the contraction of the glottis-closing\r\nmuscles, strictly speaking, for these muscles are too small and weak to\r\nwithstand the powerful air pressure exerted against the vocal cords.[4]\r\nThe point of resistance is located just above the vocal cords. The\r\nsudden air pressure exerted on the interior walls of the larynx by the\r\nexpiratory contraction causes the ventricles of the larynx to expand by\r\ninflation. This inflation of the ventricles brings their upper margins,\r\nformed by the false vocal cords, into contact. Thus the opening from the\r\nlarynx into the pharynx is closed. This closure is not effected by any\r\nmuscular contraction, therefore it is not dependent on the strength of\r\nthe muscular fibers of the false vocal cords. It is an automatic\r\nvalvular action, directly under voluntary control so far as the\r\ncontraction of the expiratory muscles is concerned, but independent of\r\nvolition as regards the action of the false vocal cords. On account of\r\ntheir important function in this operation the false vocal cords are\r\ncalled the 'breath-bands.' Closure of the glottis by the inflation of\r\nthe ventricles imposes no strain on the vocal cords.\r\n\r\n[Note 4: One of the strongest arguments of the \"breath-band\"\r\nadvocates is based on this action,--the resistance of the closed glottis\r\nto a powerful expiratory pressure. The theory of breath-control by\r\n\"opposed muscular action\" takes no cognizance of this operation. It will\r\nhowever be shown in Chapter II of Part II that the \"breath-band\"\r\ntheorists are mistaken in asserting that the action of holding the\r\nbreath is not performed by the glottis-closing muscles.]\r\n\r\n\"Control of the breath in singing is effected by this automatic valvular\r\naction. To produce a tone according to this system, the lungs must be\r\nfilled and the breath held in the manner just described, while the vocal\r\ncords are brought to the proper degree of tension; then the tone is\r\nstarted by allowing the 'breath-bands' to separate very slightly, so\r\nthat a thin stream of air is forced through the opening between their\r\nmargins. The tone is ushered in by a slight explosive sound, which is\r\nnothing but the well-known stroke of the glottis. So long as the\r\nexpiratory pressure is steadily maintained, this tone may be held, and\r\nyet no strain is imposed on the vocal cords. Perfect control of the\r\nbreath is thus attained. For a powerful tone, the breath blast is\r\ngreater, therefore the ventricles are more widely inflated, and the\r\nopening between the 'breath-bands' becomes narrower. The action is\r\nalways automatic; once the tone is correctly started, the singer need\r\npay no further attention to the operation of the 'breath-bands.' All\r\nthat is necessary is to maintain a steady breath pressure.\"\r\n\r\nIn the methods of all the \"breath-band\" advocates, the first and most\r\nimportant step toward perfect tone-production is held to be the\r\nacquirement of this automatic breath-control. As in the \"opposed\r\nmuscular\" system, the initial exercises are toneless drills in\r\nbreathing. The basic exercise, of which all the others are variations,\r\nis as follows: \"Fill the lungs, then hold the breath an instant, and\r\nforcibly contract all the chest muscles. Then force the air out slowly\r\nand powerfully through the glottis.\" Practice of this exercise is always\r\naccompanied by a hissing sound, caused by the escape of the air through\r\nthe narrow slit between (presumably) the \"breath-bands.\" Tone-production\r\nby the same muscular action is very simple, and requires no further\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nIn its practical aspect this system of breath-control is the direct\r\nopposite of the \"opposed muscular\" system. In one the breath is expelled\r\npowerfully, the object being to bring a strong expiratory pressure to\r\nbear on the larynx. In the other system, the air is held back, in order\r\nthat the larynx be exposed to as slight a pressure as possible.\r\n\r\nThe \"breath-band\" advocates hold that the glottic stroke is the key to\r\ncorrect laryngeal action. As a rule they instruct their pupils to attack\r\nevery tone, throughout all their practising, with the stroke of the\r\nglottis. In the course of time the automatic valvular action is supposed\r\nto become so well established that the singer can dispense with the\r\nglottic stroke in public performance. Needless to say, these teachers\r\nusually recognize that this explosive sound is very harsh and unmusical,\r\nand utterly out of place in artistic singing.\r\n\r\nAn important claim of the \"breath-band\" teachers is that their doctrine\r\ncontains the explanation of the traditional precept, \"Support the tone.\"\r\nTheir idea is that the throat, being \"firmly set,\" furnishes a secure\r\nbase for the tone to rest on. This explanation is of course utterly\r\nunscientific, and it cannot be said to throw any light on the meaning of\r\nthe precept. \"Singing on the breath\" is also referred to this system of\r\nbreath-control, but with no more coherence than the \"Support of the\r\ntone.\"\r\n\r\nNo necessary connection obtains between systems of breath-control and\r\nthose of breathing strictly speaking, that is, of inspiration. As has\r\nbeen said, the great majority of vocal theorists adhere to the \"opposed\r\nmuscular action\" breath-control. In this number are included advocates\r\nof every known system of breathing. Bitter controversies have been\r\ncarried on between champions of different modes of breathing, who yet\r\nagree that the breath must be controlled by \"opposed action.\" This is\r\nalso true, although not to the same extent, among the \"breath-band\"\r\nteachers. And to render the confusion on the subject of breathing and\r\nbreath-control complete, instances might be cited of controversies\r\nbetween teachers who agree as to the correct mode of inspiration, and\r\nyet disagree on the manner of controlling the expiration.\r\n\r\nBoth systems of breath-control cannot be right; if one is correct, the\r\nother must necessarily be absolutely wrong. Instead of attempting to\r\ndecide between them, it will be seen that both are false, and that the\r\ntheory on which they rest is erroneous. This discussion is reserved for\r\na later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nREGISTERS AND LARYNGEAL ACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably no other topic of Vocal Science has been studied so earnestly\r\nas the registers of the voice. Yet on no other topic is there such wide\r\ndiversity of opinion among theorists and investigators.\r\n\r\nVery little is definitely known regarding the manner in which the\r\nsubject of registers was treated by the old Italian masters. Suffice it\r\nto say here that the old masters did not refer the registers to changes\r\nin the laryngeal action. They were treated simply as different qualities\r\nof tone, each quality best adapted to be sung only in a portion of the\r\nvoice's compass.\r\n\r\nIn the early decades of the nineteenth century the registers of the\r\nvoice received much attention from vocal theorists, especially in Paris.\r\nGarcia's first published work, _Mémoire sur la Voix humaine_, was\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences in 1840. This Mémoire gives the\r\nresults of observations which Garcia made on his own pupils; it deals\r\nmainly with the position of the larynx during the singing of tones in\r\nthe various registers. Garcia describes how the larynx is raised and\r\nlowered in the throat, according to the register in which the tones are\r\nproduced. He also notes the position of the tongue and the soft palate.\r\n\r\nWidespread interest was awakened by the account of Garcia's\r\nlaryngoscopic investigations of the registers, published in 1855. The\r\nattention of the great majority of vocalists was at once drawn to the\r\nsubject, and the actions of the vocal cords in the different registers\r\nwere studied by many prominent physicians and voice specialists.\r\nExhaustive treatises on the registers have since been published by Mme.\r\nSeiler, Behnke, Curwen, Mills, Battaille, Curtis, Holmes, and by a large\r\nnumber of other investigators.\r\n\r\nAll the results of the laryngoscopic investigation of the vocal action\r\nhave been disappointing in the extreme. In the first place, no two\r\nobservers have obtained exactly the same results. Writing in 1886, Sir\r\nMorell Mackenzie says: \"Direct observation with the laryngoscope is, of\r\ncourse, the best method at our disposal, but that even its testimony is\r\nfar from unexceptionable is obvious from the marvelous differences as to\r\nmatters of _fact_ that exist among observers. It is hardly too much to\r\nsay that no two of them quite agree as to what is seen.\" (_The Hygiene\r\nof the Vocal Organs_, London, 1886.) Wesley Mills, in his latest work,\r\nendeavors to show a substantial agreement among the best equipped\r\nobservers of the registers, but his attempt can hardly be called\r\nconvincing. (_Voice Production in Singing and Speaking_, Philadelphia,\r\n1906.) Opinions on the subject of registers, held by the leading voice\r\nspecialists to-day, are fully as divergent as in 1886. Widely different\r\nstatements are made by prominent authorities as to the number of\r\nregisters, the vocal cord action by which each register is produced, and\r\nthe number of notes which each one should properly include.\r\n\r\nAnother deficiency of the doctrine of registers is even more serious in\r\nits bearing on practical instruction. Not only have all investigators\r\nfailed to define exactly what the correct laryngeal action is. Even if\r\nthis were determined it would still be necessary to find means for\r\nimparting command of this correct action to the student of singing.\r\nKnowing how the vocal cords should act does not help the singer in the\r\nleast to govern their action. What the vocal student wishes to know is\r\nhow to cause the vocal cords to assume the correct position for each\r\nregister. On this, the most important topic of mechanical Voice Culture,\r\nVocal Science has shed no light whatever. A student may hear\r\ndescriptions of the laryngeal action, and study the highly interesting\r\nlaryngoscopic photographs of the vocal cords, until thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the theoretical side of the subject. Even then, the student is no\r\nbetter able to control the vocal cord action than when profoundly\r\nignorant of the whole matter.\r\n\r\nThis deficiency of Vocal Science is frankly recognized by one of the\r\nlatest authoritative writers on the subject, Dr. Wesley Mills. On page\r\n173 of his work just quoted, he advises students to _hear the great\r\nsingers_, to note carefully the _quality of tone_ which characterizes\r\neach register, and to _imitate these qualities_ with their own voices.\r\nThis advice may almost be described as revolutionary. Vocal theorists\r\nhave always assumed that the correct action cannot be acquired by\r\nimitation. In this advice to rely on the imitative faculty for acquiring\r\ncontrol of the laryngeal action, Dr. Mills abandons the basic principle\r\nof modern methods. Without exception, all instruction in singing is\r\nto-day based on the idea of mechanical tone-production. An entirely new\r\ntheory of Voice Culture is involved in this advice of Dr. Mills.\r\n\r\nTurning to practical methods of instruction, it is found that the\r\nsubject of registers is very seldom treated in the manner suggested by\r\nthe theoretical works on the voice. This would be, to make the \"placing\"\r\nof the voice in the different registers the exclusive subject of\r\ninstruction for a certain number of lessons;--to train each register of\r\nthe voice separately;--when the correct vocal cord action had been\r\nestablished in each register, to unite the different registers, and to\r\ncorrect any \"breaks\" which might have developed. Comparatively few\r\nteachers attempt to follow this course. The great majority treat the\r\nregisters in a much less systematic fashion. A single half-hour lesson\r\nusually includes explanations and exercises on several topics of\r\nmechanical tone-production, as well as hints on agility, style,\r\nexecution, etc. As merely one of this variety of subjects, the\r\nregisters usually receive rather desultory attention.\r\n\r\nSome teachers profess to ignore the subject of registers entirely. They\r\nmaintain that, when properly trained from the beginning, the compass of\r\nthe voice is one homogeneous whole; \"breaks\" and changes of quality are\r\nin their opinion merely the results of bad instruction. But the general\r\nbelief of vocal authorities is overwhelmingly against these teachers.\r\nThe condition which they describe is without doubt the ideal of vocal\r\nmanagement; but the vast majority of teachers believe that this\r\ncondition cannot be attained without some attention being paid to the\r\nindividual registers.\r\n\r\nMost teachers recognize either two registers,--chest and head; or\r\nthree,--chest, middle, and head. Comparatively few extremists recognize\r\nmore than three. Several sets of names for the registers have been\r\nproposed by vocal theorists,--thick and thin, long reed and short reed,\r\nhigh and low, etc. But these names have not been adopted by teachers to\r\nany extent.\r\n\r\nOne important phase of the registers has not received much attention\r\nfrom the laryngoscopic investigators. This is, that most of the notes of\r\nthe voice's compass can be produced at will in more than one register.\r\nVocal teachers as a rule recognize this fact. Julius Stockhausen for\r\ninstance, in his _Gesangsmethode_ (Leipzig, 1884), says: \"The registers\r\ncross each other. The two principal registers of the voice have many\r\ntones in common. The perfect blending of the registers on a single tone\r\nleads to the _crescendo_, called in Italian the _messa di voce_.\"\r\nTeachers generally do not set hard and fast limits to the extent of each\r\nregister; they direct that in singing up the scale the student pass\r\ngradually from chest to middle, middle to head voice, etc.\r\n\r\nIn most practical methods the chest register occupies about the same\r\nposition; this is also true of the head register. Even those teachers\r\nwho profess to ignore registers recognize these two distinct qualities\r\nof tone; they instruct their pupils to sing low notes in one quality,\r\nand high notes in the other. This is in fact the general practice. In\r\nthis connection the topics of registers and resonance are often\r\ncombined. The terms \"head voice,\" \"head register,\" and \"nasal\r\nresonance,\" are used interchangeably by the great majority of teachers.\r\nThis is also true of the expressions \"chest voice,\" \"chest resonance,\"\r\nand \"chest register.\"\r\n\r\nIn practical instruction, the extending of the compass of the voice is\r\nusually treated, rather loosely perhaps in most cases, as a feature of\r\nthe registers. Methods vary greatly in points of detail, but in most of\r\nthem instruction on this topic is given along the same general lines.\r\nUsually the three classes of voices receive different treatment, one\r\nform of instruction being used for sopranos and tenors, another for\r\nmezzo-sopranos and baritones, and a third for altos and bassos.\r\n\r\nIn teaching students with high voices, teachers usually \"place\"[5] the\r\nmedium notes first, roughly speaking, from G to d (for male voices one\r\noctave lower). Then the lower notes are developed, mostly by descending\r\nscale passages, the lowest note practised being usually C. The high\r\nnotes are sometimes \"placed\" by ascending scale passages and arpeggios,\r\nbut more often by the octave jump and descending scale. There is room\r\nfor considerable variation in this class of exercises, but they all\r\nconform to the same general principle.\r\n\r\n[Note 5: The expression \"placing the voice\" is more fully treated in\r\nChap. VI. It is assumed, however, that the reader is familiar with the\r\nordinary usage of this expression.]\r\n\r\nFor mezzos and baritones about the same system is followed, the\r\nexercises being sung a major third or so lower. In the case of\r\ncontraltos and bassos, the voice is usually trained from the middle in\r\nboth directions. Most teachers favor the \"chest voice\" for singers of\r\nthese types throughout the entire compass.\r\n\r\nA discussion of the use of special vowels and consonants in this class\r\nof exercises is contained in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nIt must not be understood that this topic of instruction is assigned by\r\nmany teachers to any particular period of the student's progress.\r\nMoreover, practice in the registers seldom forms the exclusive material\r\nof lessons and home study for any definite time. The wide range of\r\ntopics considered in the average singing lesson has already been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nVery little connection can be traced between the scientific doctrine of\r\nregisters, and the treatment which this subject receives in modern\r\nmethods. This is only to be expected, in view of the fact that\r\nlaryngoscopic investigation has not resulted in practical rules for\r\nmanaging the vocal cords. The registers of the voice are handled by\r\nmodern teachers in a purely empirical fashion.\r\n\r\n_Movements of the Larynx, Tongue, and Soft Palate_\r\n\r\nIt was remarked, in speaking of the registers, that no mechanical means\r\nhas ever been found for directly controlling the operations of the vocal\r\ncords. To this statement one apparent exception is seen in the method\r\noriginated by John Howard. This earnest student of the voice sought to\r\ncarry out, to its logical conclusion, the accepted idea of mechanical\r\nvocal control. In this respect he stands practically alone. His is the\r\nonly method which even pretends to reduce the entire operation of\r\ncorrect tone-production to a set of defined muscular contractions.\r\n\r\nHoward's theories, with the details of a practical method based thereon,\r\nare fully described in his most important published work, _The\r\nPhysiology of Artistic Singing_, New York, 1886. A complete exposition\r\nof Howard's theories is not called for here. For the present purpose\r\nthe following short summary will suffice:\r\n\r\n\"The difference between correct tone-production and any incorrect vocal\r\naction is solely a matter of laryngeal adjustment and vocal cord action.\r\nWhether the tone produced be right or wrong, the influence of the\r\nresonance cavities is about the same. It is therefore idle to pay any\r\nattention to the subject of air resonance. Only one form of resonance is\r\nof any value in tone-production (considered as distinct from vowel\r\nformation). This is the sounding-board resonance of the bones of the\r\nhead and chest. To secure this, the most important reinforcement of the\r\ntone, the larynx must be firmly held in a fixed position against the\r\nbackbone, at the fifth cervical vertebra. All theories as to the\r\nregisters of the voice, derived from laryngoscopic observation, are\r\ncompletely erroneous.\r\n\r\n\"In the production of tone, the muscular tissue of the vocal cords is\r\nthrown into vibration by the air blast, and not merely the membranous\r\ncovering of the inner edges of the cords. For a soft tone, only a\r\nportion of the fleshy mass of the vocal cords vibrates; if this tone is\r\ngradually swelled to _fortissimo_, a constantly increasing portion of\r\nthe muscular tissue is called into play. For the loudest tone, the\r\nentire mass of the vocal cords is bought into vibration. Thus the\r\nincreased volume of the tone results not alone from the increase in the\r\npower of the breath blast. Each addition to the power of the expiration\r\ndemands also a change in the adjustment of the vocal cords.\r\n\r\n\"The contractions of the muscles inside the larynx, including the vocal\r\ncords, cannot be brought under direct voluntary control. But these\r\ncontractions can be regulated by the actions of other sets of muscles,\r\nviz., those by which the larynx is connected with the skeletal framework\r\nof the head, neck, and chest. These latter muscles can all be controlled\r\nby direct volition. Each of these sets of muscles has its function in\r\ntone-production. One set pulls the larynx backward, into the position\r\nalready described, against the backbone. Two other opposed sets hold the\r\nlarynx firmly in this position, one set pulling upward, the other\r\ndownward. Finally, and most important in their influence on the actions\r\nof the vocal cords, a fourth set of muscles comes into play. These tilt\r\nthe thyroid cartilage forward or backward, and thus bring about a\r\ngreater or less tension of the vocal cords, independent of the\r\ncontractions of the muscles of the vocal cords themselves. In this way\r\nis regulated the amount of the fleshy mass of the vocal cords exposed to\r\nthe expiratory blast. Correct tone-production results when exactly the\r\nnecessary degree of strength is exerted by each one of these four sets\r\nof muscles.\"\r\n\r\nFor each of these groups of muscles Howard devised a system of exercises\r\nand drills by which the singer is supposed to bring all the movements\r\ninvolved under direct voluntary control. The parts thus exercised are\r\nthe tongue, the soft palate, the jaw, the fauces, and also the muscles\r\nby which the larynx is raised and lowered in the throat, and those by\r\nwhich the chest is raised. In teaching a pupil Howard took up each part\r\nin turn. A sufficient number of lessons was devoted to each set of\r\nmuscles for the pupil (presumably) to acquire the necessary control of\r\neach group.\r\n\r\nHoward also paid much attention to the breath; he worked out the system\r\nof high-chest breathing in a really masterly fashion. But his manner of\r\ndealing with this subject did not differ from that of a great number of\r\nother teachers.\r\n\r\nHoward retired from active teaching about 1895. His theories of the\r\nvocal action have never been generally accepted by vocal theorists, and\r\nthe number of teachers who now profess to follow his method is very\r\nsmall. There are, however, many other masters whose methods, in their\r\nmain features, are patterned after Howard's. These latter teachers may\r\ntherefore be justly said to follow the Howard system, even though they\r\ngive him no credit for their doctrines of vocal control.\r\n\r\nHoward usually insisted that his pupils should understand the\r\ntheoretical basis of his method, and the exact purpose of each exercise\r\nand muscular contraction. But as a rule his successors do not make this\r\ndemand on their pupils. They are content to have the students practise\r\nthe prescribed exercises; this the students do, with very little thought\r\nabout the theory lying behind the method. For the pupil this system, as\r\nat present generally taught, consists solely of a series of muscular\r\ndrills for the tongue, larynx, palate, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this review of modern methods, the Howard system is important, mainly\r\nbecause it represents the consistent application of the idea of\r\nmechanical tone-production. As was observed, Howard's theories had very\r\nlittle influence on the general trend of Vocal Science. The external\r\nfeatures of the Howard system are indeed shared to some extent by the\r\nmethods of many other teachers. Muscular drills of about the same type\r\nare very widely used. Some teachers go so far in this respect that their\r\nmethods might almost be confounded with the Howard system. But the\r\nresemblance is purely external. Even in 1880, at the time when Howard\r\nhad fairly perfected his method, there was nothing novel about exercises\r\nof this type. The first attempts at a practical study of vocal mechanics\r\nconsisted of observations of those parts of the vocal organs whose\r\nmovements can be readily seen and felt. These are the lips, tongue,\r\npalate, and larynx. Garcia's _Mémoire_, already cited, is mainly a\r\nrecord of observations of this kind. Nearly every vocal theorist since\r\nthat time has also paid some attention to this phase of the vocal\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIn practical methods of instruction, elaborate systems of rules have\r\nlong been in use for governing the positions of the tongue, lips,\r\npalate, etc. Unlike the Howard theory, no definite scientific basis is\r\nusually given for specific directions of this kind. Each investigator\r\nhas simply noted how certain great singers held their tongues or soft\r\npalates, whether the larynx was held high or low in the throat, etc.,\r\nand considered that these must be the correct positions. It would be\r\nhard to find a greater diversity of opinion on any topic connected with\r\nthe voice than is encountered here. To enumerate all the rules which are\r\ngiven for governing the actions of each part would be useless. A few of\r\nthe contradictory opinions regarding the correct position of the larynx\r\nwill suffice to show how great is the confusion on this topic:\r\n\r\n\"The larynx should be held low in the throat for all tones.\" \"It should\r\nbe held in a fixed position high in the throat.\" \"It should be high for\r\nlow tones, and should descend as the pitch rises.\" \"It should be in a\r\nlow position for the lowest note of each register, and should rise as\r\nthe pitch rises; when the highest note of the register is reached, it\r\nshould at once descend for the lowest note of the next register.\"\r\nProminent teachers and writers could be cited as authority for each of\r\nthese rules, and indeed for several others. A similar diversity of\r\nopinion is found regarding the rules given for the position of the\r\ntongue and the soft palate.\r\n\r\nPractices vary greatly as to the amount of time and attention devoted to\r\nmuscular drills of the parts under consideration, and also as to the\r\nimportance attached to the positions of these parts. Some teachers make\r\nthis a prominent feature of their methods. The majority, however, treat\r\nthe subject much more lightly. They now and then devote a part of the\r\nlesson time to the muscular drills and exercises; for the rest, an\r\noccasional hint or correction regarding the positions of the parts is\r\ndeemed sufficient.\r\n\r\nAll the movements of the tongue, lips, and jaw are directly under\r\nvoluntary control. Exercises for these parts are therefore given only\r\nfor acquiring suppleness and agility. The muscular movements of the\r\nlarynx and soft palate are readily brought under control. Each can\r\nsimply be raised and lowered. A few minutes' daily practice, extended\r\nover three or four weeks, is generally sufficient for the student to\r\nacquire satisfactory command of these actions. But to hold the tongue,\r\npalate, and larynx in any prescribed position, while singing a tone, is\r\nan extremely troublesome matter. Those teachers who adhere to precise\r\nsystems for the positions of these parts, frequently impose much arduous\r\npractice on their pupils. As to the merits of any special system of the\r\nkind, this question is reserved for future discussion.\r\n\r\n_Attack_\r\n\r\nIt would be hard to determine when the term \"attack\" was first used to\r\ndescribe the starting of a vocal tone. Nor is it easy to define the\r\nprecise position assigned to the subject of attack by vocal theorists.\r\nNo satisfactory statement of the theory of attack can be cited from any\r\npublished treatise on Vocal Science. It is commonly asserted, rather\r\nloosely indeed, that the tone must be \"started right.\" As Clara Kathleen\r\nRogers expresses it, \"Attack the tone badly, and nothing can improve it\r\nafterwards.\" (_The Philosophy of Singing_, New York, 1893.) This\r\nstatement is in the practical sense utterly unfounded. A tone may be\r\n\"attacked\" with a nasal or throaty quality, and then be improved, by\r\nsimply eliminating the objectionable quality. Of this fact the reader\r\nmay readily convince himself. In short, all the accepted theories of\r\nattack rest on an unscientific basis.\r\n\r\nVocal theorists generally treat the subject of attack as connected in\r\nsome way with registers and laryngeal action. But as no rule has ever\r\nbeen formulated for the mechanical management of the laryngeal action,\r\nit necessarily follows that no intelligible directions are ever given to\r\nthe student for preparing to start the laryngeal action correctly.\r\n\r\nThree possible ways of attacking a tone are generally recognized. These\r\nare described by Albert B. Bach, in _The Principles of Singing_, second\r\nedition, London, 1897. They are, first, the stroke of the glottis. (This\r\nis advocated by Garcia in most of his published works, although the\r\ntestimony of many of his pupils, notably Mme. Marchesi, is that Garcia\r\nused the glottic stroke very little in actual instruction.) Second, the\r\naspirate (_h_ as in _have_), which is generally condemned. Third, the\r\napproximation of the vocal cords at the precise instant the breath blast\r\nstrikes them. This latter mode of attack is advocated by Browne and\r\nBehnke, who call it the \"slide of the glottis.\" It must be observed\r\nthat neither the stroke nor the slide of the glottis can be shown to\r\nhave any influence in causing the laryngeal muscles to adopt any\r\nparticular mode of adjustment.\r\n\r\nTurning to practical methods of instruction, little connection can be\r\ntraced between the theories of attack and the occasional directions\r\nusually given for starting the tone. The subject of attack is seldom\r\nassigned to any particular period in the course of study. Many teachers\r\nignore the matter altogether. Others devote a few minutes now and then\r\nto drilling a pupil in the stroke of the glottis, without attaching much\r\nimportance to the subject. (The position assigned to this mode of attack\r\nby the \"breath-band\" theorists has already been mentioned.) On the\r\nwhole, the matter of attack is usually treated rather loosely. The pupil\r\nis occasionally interrupted in singing a phrase, and told to \"attack the\r\ntone better.\" Needless to say, this form of instruction is in no sense\r\nscientific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nRESONANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand fully the position in Vocal Science assigned to\r\nthe doctrine of resonance, it is necessary to trace the origin and the\r\ndevelopment of this doctrine. The old Italian masters naturally knew\r\nnothing whatever of resonance, nor of any other topic of acoustics. Yet\r\nthe accepted theories of resonance in its relation to the voice are\r\ndirectly based on a set of empirical observations made by the old\r\nmasters. The facts which they noted are now a matter of common\r\nknowledge. In singing low notes a sensation of trembling or vibration is\r\nfelt in the upper chest; high notes are accompanied by a similar\r\nsensation in the head. How these sensations of vibration came to be made\r\nthe basis of the theories of vocal resonance, and of registers as well,\r\nis an interesting bit of vocal history.\r\n\r\nAlthough almost entirely ignorant of vocal mechanics in the scientific\r\nsense, the old masters were eager students of the voice. They carefully\r\nnoted the characteristic sound of each tone of the voice, and worked out\r\nwhat they believed to be a comprehensive theory of tone-production. One\r\nof their observations was that in every voice the low notes have a\r\nsomewhat different quality from the high notes. To distinguish these two\r\nqualities of tone the old masters adopted the word used for a similar\r\npurpose by the organ builders,--_register_. Further, they noted the\r\nsensation of vibration in the chest caused by singing low notes, and\r\nconcluded that these notes are actually produced in the chest. To the\r\nlower notes of the voice they therefore gave the name \"chest register.\"\r\nAs Tosi explains it, \"_Voce di Petto_ is a full voice, which comes from\r\nthe breast by strength.\" For a precisely similar reason, viz., the\r\nsensation of vibration in the head felt in singing the higher notes,\r\nthis portion of the voice was called by the old masters the \"head\r\nregister.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the study of vocal mechanics along scientific lines was undertaken,\r\nin the early decades of the nineteenth century, attention was at first\r\npaid almost exclusively to the subject of registers. The questions then\r\nmost discussed were the number of registers, the number of notes which\r\neach should include, and the precise point of production of each\r\nregister in the chest, throat, and head. Garcia's _Mémoire_, dealing\r\nwith the registers, was noticed in the preceding chapter. He showed that\r\ndifferent adjustments of the tongue, palate, and larynx are concerned in\r\nthe production of the various registers. This _Mémoire_ opened up a new\r\nline of observation, in which Garcia continued to take the lead. But the\r\nextending of the scope of inquiry concerning the registers did not\r\nresult in any unanimity of opinion on the part of the vocal\r\ninvestigators of that time.\r\n\r\nFor a few years following the invention of the laryngoscope (1855),\r\nvocal theorists ceased their disputes about the registers, and awaited\r\nthe definite results of this new mode of observation. When this potent\r\nlittle instrument was put within the reach of every investigator, it was\r\nbelieved that the mystery surrounding the registers was about to be\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\nOne important consequence of the invention of the laryngoscope was the\r\nturning of attention away from the sensations of vibration in the chest\r\nand head. Each register was ascribed to a distinct mode of operation of\r\nthe vocal cords, and for several years the terms \"chest voice\" and \"head\r\nvoice\" were held to be scientifically unsound. But with the publication\r\nof Helmholtz's _Die Lehre von den Tonempfindungen_ in 1863, the\r\nsensations of vibration again received attention. These sensations were\r\nthen made the basis of a theory of vocal resonance, which has since been\r\nadopted by the great majority of vocal scientists.\r\n\r\nUntil the publication of Helmholtz's work vocal theorists had known\r\npractically nothing of acoustics. The fact that the tones produced by\r\nthe vocal cords are increased in power and modified in quality by the\r\nresonance of the air in the mouth-pharynx cavity came as a distinct\r\nrevelation to the theoretical students of the voice. Helmholtz confined\r\nhis experiments and demonstrations to the mouth-pharynx cavity, and\r\ninvestigated in particular the influence of this cavity in producing the\r\nvarious vowel and consonant sounds. But vocal theorists at once extended\r\nthe idea of air resonance, and connected it with the well-known\r\nsensations of vibration in the chest and head. It was assumed that these\r\nsensations are caused by vibrations of the air in the chest and nasal\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nThis assumption has been accepted without question by the great majority\r\nof vocal scientists. Both the chest voice and the head voice are now\r\nbelieved to owe their distinctive qualities to the reinforcing\r\nvibrations of the air in the chest and nasal cavities respectively. The\r\nmere fact that these vibrations can be felt is held sufficient proof of\r\nthe statement. \"In every true chest tone the resonance can be distinctly\r\nfelt as a vibration (fremitus pectoralis) by the hand laid flat on the\r\nchest.\" (_Die Kunst der idealen Tonbildung_, Dr. W. Reinecke, Leipzig,\r\n1906.) It must be observed that this is by no means a satisfactory\r\nscientific proof of the doctrine of chest resonance. This feature of the\r\nsubject is reserved for discussion later.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of resonance is now generally accepted as one of the basic\r\nprinciples of Vocal Science. It is stated, in substance, by almost every\r\nauthority on the voice that \"The tone produced by the vibration of the\r\nvocal cords, even when the laryngeal action is correct in every way, is\r\nweak, of poor quality, and without character. This tone must be\r\nstrengthened and made of musical quality by utilizing the influence of\r\nresonance.\" The subject of resonance is always treated in theoretical\r\nworks on the voice under the three heads of chest, mouth-pharynx, and\r\nnasal resonance. To these a fourth is sometimes added,--the\r\nsounding-board resonance of the bones of the chest and head.\r\n\r\n_Mouth-Pharynx Resonance_\r\n\r\nConsidered strictly in its bearing on tone-production, the resonance of\r\nthe mouth-pharynx cavity does not receive much attention from\r\ntheoretical observers of the voice. The form assumed by this cavity is\r\nof necessity determined by the vowel to be sung. Aside from its function\r\nin the pronunciation of words, the influence of mouth-pharynx resonance\r\non the tones of the voice is seldom discussed by vocal scientists.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, vocal teachers pay little attention to this form of\r\nresonance. The subject of enunciation is generally treated as distinct\r\nfrom tone-production strictly speaking. While the correct emission of\r\nthe tone, in its passage from the vocal cords to the lips, is considered\r\na very important topic, this feature of tone-production has no\r\nreference to resonance.\r\n\r\nOne exception must be made to the statement that no attention is paid to\r\nmouth-pharynx resonance. This is found in an interpretation of the\r\nempirical precept, \"Sing with open throat.\" Several vocal theorists take\r\nthis precept literally, and hold that it describes a function of\r\nmouth-pharynx resonance. According to their idea the cavity must be\r\nexpanded to the largest size possible, on the theory that a large\r\nresonance cavity secures a proportionately greater reinforcement of the\r\ntone. \"The greater the size of the pharynx, whether through practice or\r\nnatural gifts, the stronger in proportion is the tone.\" (_Die Kunst der\r\nidealen Tonbildung_, Dr. W. Reinecke, Leipzig, 1906.) This theory is of\r\ncourse rather loose and unscientific. Still this idea,--a literal\r\ninterpretation of the \"open throat\" precept,--receives much attention in\r\npractical instruction.\r\n\r\nOnly one muscular action has ever been defined by which the throat might\r\nbe \"opened.\" That is, the lowering of the larynx and the raising of the\r\nsoft palate. Many teachers therefore direct that the throat be \"opened\"\r\ngradually in this way for the swelling of the tone. It is assumed that\r\nthe power of the voice is developed by singing with the larynx low in\r\nthe throat. This manner of instruction is, however, very loosely given.\r\nThe supposedly scientific interpretation of the \"open throat\" precept\r\nshades off into a purely empirical application.\r\n\r\n_Chest Resonance_\r\n\r\nIn no other topic of Vocal Science is the gap between theory and\r\npractice more striking than in the doctrine of chest resonance. Vocal\r\nteachers are in fair accord in believing the resonance of the air in the\r\nchest to be the most important influence in imparting power and \"color\"\r\nto the voice, and particularly to the lower notes of its compass.\r\nStudents of singing are in almost all cases urged to acquire a proper\r\ncommand of chest resonance. But when it comes to telling the student how\r\nto learn to govern the chest resonance, the teacher has practically\r\nnothing to offer. No direct means has ever been found for causing the\r\nair in the thorax to vibrate; this cannot be effected, so far as has yet\r\nbeen determined, by any voluntary muscular action on the part of the\r\nsinger.\r\n\r\nThis being the case, intelligible instruction in the use and management\r\nof chest resonance is hardly to be expected. Teachers of singing are\r\nobliged to fall back on purely empirical instruction on this topic. This\r\nusually takes the form of a description of the sensations experienced by\r\nthe singer when producing tones in the chest voice. How this description\r\nof the singer's sensations is applied, is discussed in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Nasal Resonance_\r\n\r\nThe lack of connection between the theories of vocal scientists and the\r\npractical methods of singing teachers is well illustrated in the subject\r\nof nasal resonance. A striking feature of all the discussions concerning\r\nthe use or avoidance of nasal resonance is the fact that vocal theorists\r\nbase their opinions entirely on empirical observations. The use of nasal\r\nresonance is condemned by almost every prominent authority on Vocal\r\nScience. Yet the only reason ever advanced for condemning nasal\r\nresonance is the fact that a tone of objectionable nasal quality seems\r\nto \"come through the nose.\" This fact cannot, of course, be questioned.\r\nIt is mentioned by Tosi, who speaks of the \"defect of singing through\r\nthe nose,\" and is observed by everybody possessed of an ear keen enough\r\nto detect the nasal quality of sound.\r\n\r\nIt is generally stated by vocal theorists that the nasal quality is\r\nimparted to the tone by the influence of the resonance of the air in the\r\nnasal cavities. In order to prove this assertion Browne and Behnke offer\r\nthe following experiment, (quoted in substance): \"Hold a hand-mirror\r\nflat, face up, just below the nostrils. Then sing a nasal tone; you will\r\nnote that the mirror is clouded, showing that part of the breath has\r\npassed through the nasal cavities. Now sing another tone, free from the\r\nfault of nasal quality; this time the mirror is not clouded, which\r\nproves that no air has passed through the cavities in question.\"\r\n(_Voice, Song and Speech._) This experiment is simplified by other\r\nauthorities, who direct that the nostrils be pinched by the fingers, and\r\nthen allowed to open by the removal of the pressure of the fingers. A\r\nsteady tone is meanwhile to be sung. It will be noted, according to\r\nthese theorists, that with the nostrils open the tone is nasal, and with\r\nthe nostrils closed the tone is not nasal. This proves to their\r\nsatisfaction that a tone passing in whole or in part through the nasal\r\ncavities must be nasal in quality.\r\n\r\nIt must be noted here that these experiments are not in any sense\r\nconvincing. A tone of objectionable nasal quality can be sung equally\r\nwell with the nostrils either closed or open, and so can a tone free\r\nfrom the nasal quality.\r\n\r\nIn theory, the mechanical prevention of nasal resonance is very simple.\r\nIt is necessary only to raise the soft palate in singing, and thus to\r\ncut off the expired breath from passing into the nasal cavities. Most\r\nvocal scientists advise that the singer hold the soft palate raised for\r\nevery tone.\r\n\r\nPractical teachers of singing pay little attention to the theoretical\r\ndiscussions concerning nasal resonance. The overwhelming majority of\r\nteachers are firm believers in nasal resonance, and make it an important\r\nfeature of their methods. They believe that this resonance is the most\r\nimportant factor in giving to the tone its \"point,\" brilliance, and\r\ncarrying power.\r\n\r\nSo far as instruction in the use of nasal resonance is concerned,\r\nteachers owe but little to the mechanical doctrines of Vocal Science.\r\nNo voluntary muscular operation has ever been found, by which the air in\r\nthe nasal cavities can be directly thrown into vibration, and so made to\r\nreinforce the tones of the voice. Instruction in the management of nasal\r\nresonance is therefore similar to that in chest resonance. The teacher\r\ndescribes the sensations experienced by a singer who produces the exact\r\nquality of tone desired. Use is also made of special vowels and\r\nconsonants, for (supposedly) acquiring command of nasal resonance. A\r\ndescription of this form of instruction is given in the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Sounding-Board Resonance_\r\n\r\nThe acoustic principle of sounding-board resonance, in its application\r\nto the voice, is discussed by several vocal scientists. It is usually\r\ntreated under two heads: first, the entire body is looked upon as a\r\nsounding board, capable of reinforcing the tones of the voice under\r\ncertain conditions. Second, the bones of the chest and of the head are\r\nthought to be thrown into vibration, in sympathy with the vibrations of\r\nthe air in the chest and nasal cavities respectively.\r\n\r\nThe importance attached by Howard to the sounding-board resonance of the\r\nentire body has already been noticed. Aside from the teachers of the\r\nHoward system, very few masters pay any attention to this feature of\r\nvocal reinforcement. Those who do so have no difficulty in dealing with\r\nthe subject. When the singer stands in the position generally considered\r\ncorrect for singing, the body is said to be in the position most\r\nfavorable for securing the benefits of this form of resonance. For this\r\nno special rules or exercises are needed.\r\n\r\nVery little attention is paid, in practical instruction, to the\r\nvibrations of the bones of the resonance cavities. Each cavity is\r\ntreated as a whole; the fact is only occasionally mentioned that the\r\nbones inclosing the cavities may vibrate, as well as the inclosed air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEMPIRICAL MATERIALS OF MODERN METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nA series of topics included in modern methods is now to be considered,\r\ndifferent in scope from the strictly mechanical features of\r\ntone-production so far described. It must be apparent to the reader that\r\nthe present understanding of the muscular processes of singing is not\r\nsufficient to furnish a complete method of instruction. This fact is\r\nthoroughly appreciated by the teachers of singing. Almost without\r\nexception they seek to supplement the mechanical doctrines by\r\ninstruction of an entirely different character. The subjects included in\r\nthis form of instruction are of several classes. They comprise the\r\nmanner of emission of the tone, the traditional precepts of the old\r\nItalian school, the singer's sensations, and the use of certain vowels\r\nand consonants for special purposes.\r\n\r\n_Emission and Forward Placing_\r\n\r\nOf all the traditional precepts, the one most frequently cited in\r\ntheoretical treatises on the voice is, \"Place the tone forward.\" For\r\nthis precept it is generally believed that a satisfactory explanation\r\nhas been found in the accepted doctrine of tone emission.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic effect of perfect singing known as the \"forward tone\"\r\nis thoroughly well known to every lover of singing. In some peculiar way\r\nthe tone, when perfectly produced, seems to issue directly from the\r\nsinger's mouth. When we listen to a poorly trained and faulty singer the\r\ntones seem to be caught somewhere in the singer's throat. We feel\r\ninstinctively that if the singer could only lift the voice off the\r\nthroat, and bring it forward in the mouth, the tones would be greatly\r\nimproved in character. It is commonly believed that the old masters knew\r\nsome way in which this can be done. Just what means they used for this\r\npurpose is not known. But the accepted scientific interpretation of the\r\n\"forward tone\" precept is held by vocal theorists to render the subject\r\nperfectly clear.\r\n\r\nSir Morell Mackenzie states the correct emission of the tone as one of\r\nthe three cardinal principles of the vocal action. \"The regulation of\r\nthe force of the blast which strikes against the vocal cords, the\r\nplacing of these in the most favourable position for the effect which it\r\nis desired to produce, and the direction of the vibrating column of air\r\nwhich issues from the larynx are the three elements of artistic\r\nproduction.\" (_The Hygiene of the Vocal Organs_, London, 1886.) His\r\nanalysis of the mechanical and acoustic processes involved in emission\r\nmay be cited as typical of the views of the great majority of vocal\r\nscientists. \"It (the column of sound) must be projected against the roof\r\nof the cavity behind the upper front teeth, from which it rebounds\r\nsharply and clearly to the outside.\" Mme. Seiler expresses the idea\r\nsomewhat differently, but the meaning is about the same. \"A correct\r\ndisposition of the tones of the voice consists in causing the air,\r\nbrought into vibration by the vocal ligaments, to rebound from\r\nimmediately above the front teeth, where it must be concentrated as much\r\nas possible, rebounding thence to form in the mouth continuous\r\nvibrations.\" (_The Voice in Singing_, Phila., 1886.)\r\n\r\nTo the vocal theorists this is no doubt thoroughly convincing and\r\nsatisfactory. But as a topic of practical instruction in singing this\r\ntheory of tone emission is utterly valueless. How can the \"column of\r\nvocalized breath\" be voluntarily directed in its passage through the\r\npharynx and mouth? No muscular process has ever been located, by which\r\nthe singer can influence the course of the expired breath, and direct it\r\nto any specific point in the mouth. Even if the expired breath does, in\r\nperfect singing, take the course described, knowledge of this fact\r\ncannot enable the singer to bring this about. The accepted doctrine of\r\ntone emission is of no benefit whatever to the teacher of singing. He\r\nknows what the \"forward tone\" is, that is, what it sounds like, just as\r\nwell no doubt as did the old Italian master. But if the latter knew how\r\nto enable his pupils to obtain the \"forward\" character of tone, the\r\nmodern teacher is to that extent not so well off.\r\n\r\nIn view of the prevailing ignorance of any means for securing the\r\n(supposedly) correct emission of tone, intelligible instruction on this\r\ntopic is hardly to be expected. But the great majority of teachers lay\r\ngreat stress on the need of acquiring the correct emission. The best\r\nthey can do is to explain the scientific doctrine to their pupils; the\r\nstudents are generally left to find for themselves some way of applying\r\nthe explanation. In many cases the master tries to assist the student by\r\ndescribing the singer's sensations, experienced when producing a\r\n\"forward\" tone.\r\n\r\nCertain vowels and consonants are usually held to be especially favored\r\nby a \"forward position,\" and exercises on these are very widely used for\r\nsecuring a \"forward\" tone. These exercises are described in a later\r\nparagraph. It will be noticed however that this use of vowels is not an\r\napplication of the theory of \"forward emission.\" The vowel sounds are\r\nbelieved to owe their \"forward position\" to resonance, while \"emission\"\r\nis purely a matter of direction or focusing of the breath-blast. The\r\nwhole subject of emission and forward placing is in a very\r\nunsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\n_The Traditional Precepts in Modern Instruction_\r\n\r\nSo much importance is attached by modern teachers to the traditional\r\nprecepts of the old school that this subject calls for somewhat lengthy\r\ntreatment. Before discussing the manner in which the precepts are\r\napplied in practical instruction, it will be well to review first the\r\ninterpretations of the precepts offered by different vocal scientists.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, in the first place, that no single one of the\r\nprecepts has ever been satisfactorily explained; that is, no direct\r\nmeans of performing the actions indicated by the precepts has ever been\r\nfound. If ever the precepts had a definite meaning, considered as\r\nspecific directions for performing certain actions in a special way,\r\nthat meaning has been lost. Mechanical analysis has not reduced the\r\nprecepts to a form in which they are of direct value to the modern\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nThat the \"forward tone\" is interpreted as a reference to the emission of\r\nthe voice was noted earlier in this chapter. The explanation of the\r\n\"open throat\" precept as a function of mouth-pharynx resonance has also\r\nbeen mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"Singing on the breath\" is a very perplexing subject for vocal\r\ntheorists. Many authorities assert that this precept describes an\r\neffect obtained by the \"opposed muscular action\" breath-control. (See\r\ncitation from Shakespeare in Chapter II.) But this explanation is hardly\r\nsatisfactory; if the precept had meant no more than breath-control, it\r\nwould have been forgotten long ago.\r\n\r\nThe \"support of the tone\" is mentioned by a large number of theoretical\r\nwriters on the voice. These writers generally state, in substance, that\r\n\"the tone must be supported by the breathing muscles of the chest, and\r\nnot by the throat muscles.\" (See _The Technics of Bel Canto_, by G. B.\r\nLamperti, New York, 1905.) But this explanation is hardly to be\r\nconsidered as a scientific doctrine. Every one knows that a tone has no\r\nweight, so in the physical sense it can need no support. In short,\r\nscientific analysis has thrown no more light on this than any other of\r\nthe old precepts.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the modern teacher's complete ignorance of the\r\nmechanical operations which they seem to indicate, the old precepts form\r\na very important feature of instruction in singing. The great majority\r\nof teachers cite these precepts constantly, and frequently direct their\r\npupils to \"open the throat,\" to \"bring the tone forward,\" etc. Is it to\r\nbe believed that an intelligent master would use these directions in any\r\noccult or cabalistic sense? Such a statement is occasionally made by a\r\nconsistent upholder of the mechanical system of Voice Culture. Paulo\r\nGuetta, for example, in a recent exhaustive work on the subject,\r\nridicules the use of the old precepts. Says this ardent advocate of\r\nmechanical instruction in singing:\r\n\r\n\"Nowadays alchemy and necromancy awaken nothing but curiosity. How then\r\ncan one who thinks and reasons admit that an art can be cultivated and\r\nsustained by theories extravagant, fantastic, enigmatic, explained and\r\ncondensed in abstruse phrases and sentences, which not only have no\r\nmeaning whatever, but even lead one to doubt whether the teacher himself\r\nknows what result it is desired to obtain? Do you wish a little example?\r\nBehold!\r\n\r\n\"'Press the whole voice against the mask.' 'Place the voice in the\r\nhead.' 'The voice is directed to the nasal cavities.' 'Place the voice\r\nforward.'\r\n\r\n\"Others, with the most austere gravity, will tell you that your voice is\r\ntoo far back, or that you send the voice to the lower teeth, and promise\r\nin a few days to place the voice forward, at the upper teeth, or\r\nwherever else it should be.\" (_Il Canto nel suo Mecanismo_, Milan,\r\n1902.)\r\n\r\nThis statement is by no means justified. The precepts have a real and\r\ndefinite meaning for the vocal teacher. Any one familiar with the\r\nhighest type of artistic singing must have observed that the singer's\r\n\"throat seems to be open\"; the tones impress the hearer as being in some\r\nway \"forward in the singer's mouth,\" and not at the vocal cords; the\r\nvoice \"seems to be supported\" somewhere; the tones float out freely on\r\nthe breath. A harsh and badly produced voice seems to be held in the\r\nsinger's throat by main force. The critical hearer feels instinctively\r\nthat such a singer's voice would be greatly improved if the tones could\r\nonly be supported in a forward position in the mouth, and kept from\r\nslipping back into the throat. It seems that this would relieve the\r\nthroat of the strain of holding the tone; the throat would then be open,\r\nand the voice would float out freely on the breath.\r\n\r\nIn short, the traditional precepts describe accurately the most striking\r\npoints of difference between perfect singing and bad singing, so far as\r\nthe effect on the listener is concerned. Modern teachers are thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the highest standards of the vocal art; they fully\r\nappreciate how well the precepts describe the perfection of singing.\r\nThrough long continued listening to voices, the precepts come to have a\r\nvery real meaning. It is inevitable therefore that the teacher should\r\ntry to impart to the pupil this intimate feeling for the voice. True,\r\nthis acquaintance with the voice is purely empirical; as has just been\r\nremarked, no mechanical analysis of this empirical knowledge has ever\r\nbeen successfully made. The modern teacher's apprehension of the meaning\r\nof the precepts is only very vaguely connected with a supposed insight\r\ninto the mechanical processes of tone-production.\r\n\r\nYet there is nothing vague about the impression made on the teacher in\r\nlistening to his pupils. On the contrary, every faulty tone impresses\r\nthe teacher very keenly and definitely as being too far back, or as\r\ncaught in the throat, or as falling back for lack of support, etc. How\r\ncould it be expected then, that the teacher should refrain from telling\r\nthe pupil to correct the faulty production, in the manner so clearly and\r\ndirectly indicated by the tones?\r\n\r\nBut this direct application of the precepts is of absolutely no value in\r\ninstruction, because of the teacher's ignorance of the mechanical\r\nprocesses supposedly involved. There is after all some justification for\r\nGuetta's criticism of empirical instruction. It is all very well for the\r\nteacher to feel that the pupil's voice is gripped in the throat, and to\r\nbid him \"open your throat.\" The pupil may strive ever so earnestly to\r\nopen his throat, but he does not know how, and the teacher is utterly\r\nunable to tell him.\r\n\r\nAll instruction based on the empirical precepts is thus seen to be\r\nextremely unsatisfactory. While the precepts convey a very valuable\r\nmeaning to the teacher, no way has ever been found for translating this\r\nmeaning into rules for the mechanical management of the vocal organs.\r\nRecourse is had, to some extent, to a description of the singer's\r\nsensations; exercises on special vowels and consonants are also much\r\nused, for imparting the ideas embodied in the precepts. Both of these\r\ntopics are now to be considered.\r\n\r\n_The Singer's Sensations_\r\n\r\nThe correct use of the voice awakens in the singer a variety of\r\nsensations generally held to be different from those accompanying any\r\nincorrect vocal action.\r\n\r\nOne important fact must first be noted regarding the manner in which the\r\nsinger's sensations are described by various authorities. The use of the\r\nvoice awakens a wide variety of local sensations, which bear no\r\nnecessary relation to each other. A singer may, at will, pay entire\r\nattention to any one, or to any particular set, of these sensations, and\r\nfor the time being completely ignore all the others.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically considered, the singer's sensations are of two\r\nclasses,--first, muscular sensations strictly speaking; and second, a\r\nsense of tingling or vibration, definitely located usually about the\r\nbreast bone, and in the front and upper part of the head.\r\n\r\n_Muscular Sensations of Singing_\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to analyze and describe exactly the muscular\r\nsensations which accompany any complex action. Swimming, diving,\r\ndancing, skating,--each awakens a set of extremely vivid muscular\r\nfeelings; yet to describe these sensations so graphically that they\r\ncould be felt in imagination by one who had never experienced them\r\nactually,--that would be almost impossible.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar aspect of muscular sensations is particularly true as\r\nregards the action of singing. While every vocal teacher knows exactly\r\nhow it feels to sing properly, all descriptions of the singer's muscular\r\nsensations are extremely vague. But the vividness of these sensations\r\nkeeps them constantly before the teacher's mind, and some application of\r\nthem, in the present state of Voice Culture, is almost inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe basic sensation of correct singing, as generally described, is a\r\nfeeling of perfect poise and harmony of the whole body; this is\r\naccompanied by a sense of freedom about the throat and jaw, and firm\r\ngrasp and control of the expiratory muscles. Attempts are frequently\r\nmade to amplify this description, but the results are always very vague.\r\nA feeling of \"absence of local effort\" at the throat is much spoken of,\r\nor \"perfect relaxation of the vocal muscles.\"\r\n\r\nA few specially localized muscular sensations are also much discussed.\r\nDescriptions of this class however are often so loosely given as to\r\nrender a definite statement almost impossible. Most frequently mentioned\r\nare the feeling of \"backward pressure in the throat,\" and of \"drinking\r\nin the tone,\" instead of sending it out. Then again, the \"tone must be\r\nfelt at the upper front teeth.\" A feeling as of an \"expanded and\r\nflexible vocal tube, extending from the base of the lungs to the lips,\"\r\nis also much talked of. \"Feel that you grow bigger as the tone swells\"\r\nis about as intelligible as the feeling of \"floating jaw.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the subject of the singer's muscular sensations is usually\r\nrather mystifying to the student.\r\n\r\n_Sensations of Tingling or Vibration_\r\n\r\nDescriptions of sensations of this class are much more coherent than\r\nthose just considered. A definite location is given to the feelings, in\r\nthe chest and in the head.\r\n\r\nA feeling of trembling in the upper chest is usually held to indicate\r\nthat the chest cavity is working properly as a resonator. This\r\nsensation is therefore the chief reliance of most teachers in \"placing\"\r\nthe lower tones, especially for low voices. Sensations in the nasal\r\ncavities and head are utilized for acquiring control of nasal resonance,\r\nfor placing the upper notes of the voice, and for \"bringing the voice\r\nforward.\" Exercises for control of both cavities, on special vowels and\r\nconsonants, combine the two topics, \"vowel position\" and sensation.\r\n\r\n_Singing in the Mask_\r\n\r\nIn recent years a method of instruction has been developed in France,\r\nwhich is commonly called by its advocates \"singing in the mask.\" The\r\nbasic idea of this method is that the singer must imagine his face to be\r\ncovered by a mask, and must \"sing into this mask.\" This idea may seem\r\nrather vague at first; but a few trials will show how easy it is for the\r\nsinger to persuade himself that he projects his voice into his face.\r\n\r\nThis method goes to the extreme in utilizing the sensations of vibration\r\nin the nose and forehead. These sensations are analyzed, localized, and\r\ndescribed, down to the most minute detail. While other topics of\r\ninstruction are included,--breathing, registers, position of tongue,\r\nlarynx, palate, etc., everything else is subordinated to nasal\r\nresonance. \"Singing in the mask\" is of course a purely empirical method,\r\nand little has been attempted in the way of justifying it on scientific\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nAll instruction based on the singer's sensations is purely empirical, in\r\nthe meaning ordinarily attached to this word in treatises on Vocal\r\nScience. Theoretical works on the voice seldom touch on the subject of\r\nsensations, nor do the vocal teachers generally make this subject\r\nprominent when speaking of their methods.[6]\r\n\r\n[Note 6: An exception to this statement is seen in the recently\r\npublished book of Mme. Lilli Lehmann, _Meine Gesangskunst_, Berlin,\r\n1902. This famous artist and teacher devotes by far the greater part of\r\nher book to a minute analysis and description of the singer's\r\nsensations.]\r\n\r\nSensations occupy a rather peculiar position in modern methods. They are\r\na distinctly subsidiary element of instruction and are seldom raised to\r\nthe dignity accorded to the mechanical doctrines of vocal management.\r\nThe use of the singer's sensations, as applied in practical instruction,\r\nis almost exclusively interpretive. In the mechanical sense the\r\ntraditional precepts have no meaning whatever; this is also true of\r\nseveral of the accepted doctrines of Vocal Science. For example, the\r\nprecept \"Support the tone,\" is absolutely meaningless as a principle of\r\nmechanical vocal action. But, when interpreted as referring to a set of\r\nsensations experienced by the singer, this precept takes on a very\r\ndefinite meaning. Nobody knows what the support of the tone is, but\r\nevery vocal teacher knows how it feels. In the same way, no means is\r\nknown for directly throwing the air in the nasal cavities into\r\nvibration. But the sensation in the front of the head, which indicates,\r\npresumably, the proper action of nasal resonance, is familiar to all\r\nteachers. Most of the positive materials of modern methods are thus\r\ninterpreted in terms of sensations.\r\n\r\nTrue, the accepted theory of Vocal Science does not directly countenance\r\nthis interpretation. The basic principle of modern Voice Culture is the\r\nidea of mechanical vocal management. All instruction is supposed to aim\r\nat direct, conscious, and voluntary control of the muscular operations\r\nof singing. Teachers always impart to their pupils this idea of the\r\nmechanical control of the voice. The vocal action is always considered\r\nfrom the mechanical side. Even those expressions whose mechanical\r\nmeaning is vague or unscientific are yet used as referring definitely to\r\nmuscular actions. The conscious thought of the teacher is always turned\r\nto the mechanical idea supposedly conveyed by scientific doctrine and\r\nempirical precept. The translation of this idea into a description of\r\nsensations is almost always the result of a sub-conscious mental\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nIt therefore follows that in practical instruction the appeal to\r\nsensations is more often indirect than direct. For example, when a\r\nstudent's tones are caught in the throat, the master says\r\nexplicitly,--\"Free the tone by opening your throat.\" The master explains\r\nthe (supposed) wrong vocal action, and describes how the tone should be\r\nproduced. Incidentally, the master may also tell how and where the tone\r\nshould be felt.\r\n\r\nThere is also a great deal of instruction based frankly and directly on\r\nthe singer's sensations. Instruction of this type usually takes the form\r\nof special exercises on certain vowels and consonants, which are\r\nbelieved to be peculiarly suited for imparting command of particular\r\nfeatures of the correct vocal action. The topics generally covered are\r\nchest resonance, nasal resonance, open throat, and forward placing of\r\nthe tone. This form of instruction is held to be referable in some way\r\nto scientific principles. The laws of vowel and consonant formation\r\nformulated by Helmholtz are often cited in proof of the efficacy of\r\nexercises of this type. There is also much discussion of the \"location\"\r\nof the tone. But there is little justification for the statement that\r\ninstruction based on the singer's sensations is scientific in character.\r\nA misconception of acoustic principles is evidenced by most of the\r\nstatements made concerning the use of special vowels and consonants in\r\nsecuring the correct vocal action. The exercises which aim to utilize\r\nthe singer's sensations in producing particular vowels and consonants\r\nare now to be described.\r\n\r\n_Exercises on Special Vowels and Consonants_\r\n\r\nOf the rules concerning the use of special vowels, probably the most\r\nimportant is that _a_ (as in _far_) is the most favorable vowel for the\r\ngeneral purposes of voice training. Teachers generally have their\r\npupils sing most of their exercises on this vowel. Much attention is\r\npaid to the exact pronunciation of the vowel, and fine distinctions are\r\ndrawn between its various sounds in Italian, French, German, and\r\nEnglish. The preference for the Italian pronunciation is very general.\r\nIt is claimed for this sound that it helps materially in acquiring\r\ncommand of the \"open throat.\" Indeed, a peculiar virtue in this regard\r\nis ascribed to the Italian vowels generally. No convincing reason has\r\never been given for this belief. But the usual custom is to \"place the\r\nvoice\" on the Italian _a_, and then to take up, one at a time, the other\r\nItalian vowels.\r\n\r\nThe labial consonants, _p_, _b_, _t_, _d_, are believed to have a\r\npeculiar influence in securing the \"forward position\" of the tone. Much\r\nthe same influence is also ascribed to the vowel _oo_, although many\r\nauthorities consider _i_ (Italian) the \"most forward\" vowel. Exercises\r\ncombining these consonants and vowels are very widely used, on single\r\ntones, and on groups of three, four, or five notes. The syllables _boo_,\r\n_poo_, _too_, _doo_ are practised, or if the teacher hold to the other\r\n\"forward\" vowel, _bee_, _pee_, _tee_, _dee_; the student is instructed\r\nto hold the vowel in the \"forward position\" secured by the initial\r\nconsonant. Later on, the \"forward\" vowel is gradually widened into the\r\nother vowels; exercises are sung on _boo-ah_, _doo-ah_, etc. This form\r\nof instruction is capable of great elaboration. Many teachers use a wide\r\nvariety of combinations of these vowels and consonants; but as the basic\r\nidea is always the same, this class of exercises calls for no further\r\ndescription. The singer's sensations, notably those of \"open throat,\"\r\n\"expanded vocal tube,\" \"forward tone,\" and vibration in the chest, are\r\ngenerally brought to the pupil's attention in this form of exercise.\r\n\r\nAnother set of sounds are held to be specially adapted for securing the\r\nuse of nasal resonance. These are the letters _m_, _n_, and _ng_, when\r\nused for starting a tone, and also the vowel _i_ (Italian). The\r\nexercises used are similar in character to those just described. In\r\nsinging these exercises, the student is supposed to \"start the tone high\r\nup in the head on the initial _m_ or _n_, and to hold it there, while\r\ngradually and smoothly opening the mouth for the vowel,\" etc. The\r\nsensations specially noticed in this type of exercise are the feelings\r\nof vibration in the nose and forehead. The \"forward tone,\" as well as\r\nthe nasal resonance, is supposed to be favored by the practice of these\r\nexercises.\r\n\r\n_Enunciation_\r\n\r\nVocal teachers always recognize the importance of a clear delivery of\r\nthe text in singing. Correct enunciation is therefore considered in all\r\nmethods. A few teachers believe that a clear pronunciation helps greatly\r\nto establish the correct vocal action. Some even go so far as to say\r\nthat a clear delivery of the words will of itself insure a correct\r\ntone-production. But this theory calls for only passing comment. One has\r\nbut to turn to the vaudeville stage to see its falsity. For singers of\r\nthat class, the words are of the utmost importance, while the\r\ntone-production is usually of the very worst.\r\n\r\nA few teachers base their methods on the theory that correct\r\ntone-production results necessarily from the singing of \"pure vowels.\"\r\nThis is no doubt interesting, but still far from convincing. The problem\r\nof tone-production is not solved quite so simply.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, vocal teachers consider the subject of pronunciation as quite\r\ndistinct from tone-production. Methods differ with regard to the use of\r\nexercises in articulation, and to the stage of progress at which these\r\nexercises are taken up. Some teachers insist on their pupils practising\r\nsinging for months on the vowels, before permitting them to sing even\r\nthe simplest songs with words. Others have the pupils sing words from\r\nthe beginning of instruction. As a rule, teachers begin to give songs,\r\nand vocalises with words, very early in the course.\r\n\r\n_Throat Stiffness and Relaxing Exercises_\r\n\r\nTeachers of singing generally recognize that any stiffening of the\r\nthroat interferes with the correct action of the voice. Yet for some\r\nstrange reason vocal students are very much inclined to form habits of\r\nthroat stiffness. This constantly happens, in spite of the fact that\r\nteachers continually warn their pupils against the tendency to stiffen.\r\nOn this account, exercises for relaxing the throat are an important\r\nfeature of modern instruction in singing.\r\n\r\nNaturally, relaxing exercises are not thought to have any direct\r\nbearing in bringing about the correct vocal action. They are purely\r\npreparatory; their purpose is only to bring the vocal organs into the\r\nright condition for constructive training. For this reason, the means\r\nused for relaxing the throat are seldom mentioned among the materials of\r\ninstruction. But almost every vocal teacher is obliged to make frequent\r\nuse of throat relaxing exercises. Indeed, throat stiffness is one of the\r\nmost serious difficulties of modern Voice Culture. A student frequently\r\nseems to be making good progress, and then without much warning falls\r\ninto a condition of throat stiffness so serious as to undo for a time\r\nthe good work of several months' study. In such a case there is nothing\r\nfor the teacher to do but to drop the progressive work, and devote a few\r\nlessons to relaxing exercises.\r\n\r\nLittle difficulty is usually found in relaxing the throat, when once the\r\nnecessity becomes strikingly apparent. That is, provided progressive\r\nstudy is dropped for a time, and attention paid solely to relaxing\r\nexercises. But such cases are comparatively rare. A much more constant\r\nsource of trouble is found in the prevailing tendency of vocal students\r\nto stiffen their throats, just enough to interfere with the (supposed)\r\napplication of the teacher's method.\r\n\r\nThe exercises used for relaxing the throat are fairly simple, both in\r\ncharacter and scope. They consist mainly of toneless yawning, of single\r\ntones \"yawned out\" on a free exhalation, and of descending scale\r\npassages of the same type. Although seldom recognized as a coördinate\r\ntopic of instruction, exercises of this character are usually\r\ninterspersed among the other materials of vocal methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA GENERAL VIEW OF MODERN VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the materials of modern methods have now been described. The subject\r\nnext to be considered is the manner in which these materials are\r\nutilized in practical instruction. In other words, what is a method of\r\nVoice Culture?\r\n\r\nIn the present state of Vocal Science, the subject of tone-production\r\novershadows everything else in difficulty. When once the correct vocal\r\naction has been acquired, the student's progress is assured. Every other\r\nfeature of the singer's education is simply a matter of time and\r\napplication. But, under present conditions, the acquirement of the\r\ncorrect vocal action is extremely uncertain. On account of its\r\nfundamental importance, and more especially of its difficulty, the\r\nsubject of tone-production is the most prominent topic of instruction in\r\nsinging. The term \"method\" is therefore applied solely to the means used\r\nfor imparting the correct vocal action.\r\n\r\nThis use of the word is in accordance with the accepted theory of Voice\r\nCulture. The general belief is that tone-production is entirely distinct\r\nfrom vocal technique. Technical studies cannot profitably be undertaken,\r\naccording to the prevailing idea, until the correct management of the\r\nvocal organs has been established. This idea is supposed to be followed\r\nout in modern instruction. It is generally assumed that the voice is\r\nbrought under control through a definite series of exercises; these\r\nexercises are supposed to follow, one after the other, according to a\r\nwell-defined system. The term \"method\" implies this systematic\r\narrangement of exercises. It indicates that vocal training is a matter\r\nof precise knowledge and orderly progression.\r\n\r\nThis represents the accepted ideal of Voice Culture, rather than the\r\nactual condition. The idea that the vocal management should be imparted\r\nspecially, as something preliminary to the technical training of the\r\nvoice, is not carried out in practice. Teachers generally are striving\r\nto bring their systems into conformity with this ideal standard. They\r\nuse the expression, \"placing the voice,\" to describe the preliminary\r\ntraining in tone-production. But no successful system of this type has\r\never been evolved. The correct management of the voice never is imparted\r\nin the manner indicated by this ideal of instruction. Tone-production\r\ncontinues, throughout the entire course of study, to be the most\r\nimportant topic of instruction.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the nature of a method of Voice Culture, it is\r\nnecessary first to consider the relation which exists, in modern\r\ninstruction, between training in tone-production, and the development of\r\nvocal technique. According to the accepted theory, the voice must be\r\n\"placed\" before the real study of singing is undertaken. After the voice\r\nhas been properly \"placed,\" it is supposed to be in condition to be\r\ndeveloped by practice in singing technical exercises. But in actual\r\npractice this distinction between \"voice-placing\" exercises and\r\ntechnical studies is seldom drawn. The voice is trained, almost from the\r\nbeginning of the course of study, by practice in actual singing. The\r\nearliest exercises used for \"placing the voice\" are in every respect\r\ntechnical studies,--single tones and syllables, scale passages,\r\narpeggios, etc. It is impossible to produce even a single tone without\r\nembodying some feature of technique. Practice therefore serves a double\r\npurpose; it brings the voice gradually to the condition of perfect\r\naction, and at the same time it develops the technique. The student\r\nadvances gradually toward the correct manner of tone-production, and\r\nthis progress is evidenced solely by the improved technical use of the\r\nvoice. Considerable technical facility is attained before the\r\ntone-production becomes absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nA vocal student's practice in singing is not confined to technical\r\nexercises, strictly speaking. Vocalises, songs, and arias are taken up,\r\nusually very early in the course of study. Moreover, attention is nearly\r\nalways paid to musical expression and to artistic rendition, as well as\r\nto the vocal action and the technical use of the voice. This is true,\r\nwhether the student sings an exercise, a vocalise, a song, or an aria.\r\n\r\nFor daily home practice, the student sings, usually, first some\r\nexercises, then a few vocalises, and finally several songs and arias.\r\nEvery teacher has at command a wide range of compositions of all these\r\nkinds, carefully graded as to technical and musical difficulty. As the\r\npupil advances, more and more difficult works are undertaken. For each\r\nstage of advancement the teacher chooses the compositions best adapted\r\nto carry the student's progress still further.\r\n\r\nThere is no point in this development at which instruction in\r\ntone-production ceases, and the technical training of the voice is\r\nbegun. On the contrary, the means used for imparting the correct vocal\r\naction are interspersed with the other materials of instruction, both\r\ntechnical and artistic, throughout the entire course of study. Moreover,\r\nthe training in tone-production is carried on during the singing of the\r\ncompositions just described, as well as by practice on \"voice-placing\"\r\nexercises strictly speaking.\r\n\r\nA method of instruction in singing therefore consists primarily of a set\r\nof mechanical rules and directions for managing the voice, and\r\nsecondarily of a series of exercises, both toneless and vocal, so\r\ndesigned that the student may directly apply in practising them the\r\nrules and directions for vocal management. It must not be understood\r\nhowever that the mechanical rules are applied only to the exercises\r\nspecially designed for this purpose. These rules and directions are\r\nalso intended to be applied to everything the student sings,--exercises,\r\ntechnical studies, and musical compositions.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that the review of the topics of modern vocal\r\ninstruction covered three distinct types of materials. First, the purely\r\nmechanical doctrines, commonly regarded as the only strictly scientific\r\nprinciples of Voice Culture. These are, the rules for the management of\r\nthe breath, of the registers, of laryngeal action, and of the resonance\r\ncavities, and also the directions for attacking the tone, and for\r\nforward emission. The second class of materials is held by strict\r\nadherents of the scientific idea to be purely empirical; this class\r\nincludes the traditional precepts of the old Italian school, and also\r\nall the topics of instruction based on the singer's sensations. A third\r\nclass of materials is found in the attempts to interpret the empirical\r\ndoctrines in the light of the scientific analysis of the vocal action.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate and classify all the methods of instruction in vogue would\r\nbe almost an impossibility. Absolutely no uniformity can be found on any\r\ntopic. Even among the accepted doctrines of Vocal Science there are\r\nmany controverted points. Five distinct schools of breathing are\r\nrepresented, two of breath-control. Of well worked-out systems of\r\nregisters, at least twenty could be enumerated. Fully this number of\r\ntheories are offered regarding the correct positions of the larynx, soft\r\npalate, and tongue. Two opposed theories are held as to nasal resonance.\r\nFurther, the empirical doctrines are always stated so loosely that no\r\nreal unanimity of view can be found on any one of them.\r\n\r\nEvery vocal teacher selects the materials of instruction from these\r\ncontroverted doctrines, but neither rule nor reason determines what\r\nmaterials shall be embodied in any one method. There is no coherence\r\nwhatever in the matter. Further, there is no agreement as to which\r\ntopics of instruction are most important. One teacher may emphasize\r\nbreath-control and support of tone as the foundations of the correct\r\nvocal action, another may give this position to nasal resonance and\r\nforward placing. Yet both these teachers may include in their methods\r\nabout the same topics. The methods seem entirely different, only because\r\neach makes some one or two doctrines the most important. In short, it\r\nmight almost be said that there are as many methods as teachers.\r\n\r\nThree fairly distinct types of method may be defined, depending on the\r\nclass of materials adopted. At one extreme are found those teachers who\r\nattempt to follow strictly the scientific principles. These teachers\r\ngenerally profess to employ only the purely mechanical doctrines of\r\nVocal Science, and to ignore all empirical interpretations of these\r\ndoctrines. They generally devote a portion of every lesson to toneless\r\nmuscular drills, and insist that their pupils practise every exercise in\r\nsinging, with special attention to the throat action. These teachers\r\nattempt to follow a definite plan and order in the giving of exercises\r\nand rules. This systematic arrangement of instruction is, however,\r\nseldom followed out consistently with any one student. An important\r\nreason for this is considered in Chapter I of Part II.\r\n\r\nA very different type of method is taught by many teachers who pay\r\nspecial attention to the empirical topics of instruction. Of course no\r\nteacher professes to teach empirically; on the contrary, every method is\r\ncalled scientific, no matter what materials it embodies. Indeed, a very\r\nlittle attention paid to breathing, attack, registers, and nasal\r\nresonance, is enough to relieve any teacher of the reproach of\r\nempiricism. The teachers now being considered touch to some extent on\r\nthese topics; but most of their instruction is based on the traditional\r\nprecepts, the singer's sensations, and the special vowel and consonant\r\ndrills. In the first few lessons of the course they usually give some\r\nspecial breathing exercises, but almost always ignore breath-control.\r\nNot much is done for vocal control in the strictly muscular sense.\r\nSpecial \"voice-placing\" exercises are not used to any such extent as in\r\nthe strictly scientific methods just described, the voice-placing work\r\nbeing usually done on vocalises, songs, and arias. No system whatever is\r\nfollowed, or even attempted, in the sequence of topics touched upon. The\r\ndirections, \"Breathe deeper on that phrase,\" \"Bring that tone more\r\nforward,\" \"Open your throat for that _ah_,\" \"Feel that tone higher up in\r\nthe head,\" may follow one after the other within five minutes of\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nTeachers of this type are frequently charged, by the strict advocates of\r\nmechanical instruction, with a practice commonly known as \"wearing the\r\nvoice into place.\" This expression is used to indicate the total\r\nabandonment of system in imparting the correct vocal action. It means\r\nthat the teacher simply has the pupil sing at random, trusting to\r\nchance, or to some vague intuitive process, to bring about the correct\r\nuse of the voice. To the vocal scientist, \"wearing the voice into place\"\r\nrepresents the depth of empiricism.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of teachers occupy a middle ground between the two\r\ntypes just described. Teachers of this class touch, more or less, on\r\nevery topic of instruction, mechanical, empirical, and interpretive.\r\nTheir application of most of the topics of instruction is not quite so\r\nmechanical as in the first type of method considered. The student's\r\nattention is always directed to the vocal organs, but the idea of direct\r\nmuscular control is not so consistently put forward. As a rule, the\r\nattempt is made in the first stages of instruction to follow a\r\nsystematic plan. Breathing, and perhaps breath-control, are first taught\r\nas muscular drills, and then applied on single tones. Attack is\r\ngenerally taken up next, then simple exercises in the medium register.\r\nFollowing this, the chest and head registers are placed, and the\r\nattention is turned to emission and resonance. But in most cases, when\r\nthe pupil has covered three or four terms of twenty lessons each, all\r\nsystem is abandoned. The method from that time on is about of the type\r\ndescribed as empirical.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that this classification of methods is at best\r\nvery crude. It would not be easy to pick out any one teacher who adheres\r\nconsistently to any of the three forms of instruction described. All\r\nthat can be said is that a teacher usually tends somewhat more to one\r\ntype than to another.\r\n\r\nFurther, the degree of prominence given to the idea of direct mechanical\r\ncontrol of the voice does not classify a method quite satisfactorily.\r\nWithout exception every teacher adheres to the prevailing idea, that the\r\nvoice must be controlled and guided in some direct way,--that the singer\r\n\"must do something\" to cause the vocal organs to operate properly. All\r\nthe materials of instruction, mechanical and empirical, are utilized for\r\nthe sole purpose of enabling the student to learn how to \"do this\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral names are used by teachers to describe their methods. One\r\nprofesses to teach a \"natural method,\" another the \"pure Italian school\r\nof Bel Canto,\" a third the \"old Italian method as illustrated by Vocal\r\nScience,\" a fourth the \"strict scientific system of Voice Culture.\" No\r\nattention need be paid to these expressions, as they are seldom accurate\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\nVocal lessons are usually of thirty minutes' duration. Each student\r\ngenerally takes two such lessons every week, although in some cases\r\nthree, four, or even more are taken. A description of a few typical\r\nlessons will show how the materials of instruction are practically\r\nutilized.\r\n\r\nExample 1: The student takes a few preliminary toneless breaths. Then\r\nfollow, in the order given, a few short tones for practice on attack,\r\nsome sustained tones on the vowel _ah_, exercises on three, four, and\r\nfive notes, ascending and descending, a single tone followed by the\r\noctave jump up and descending scale, this last rising by semitones\r\nthrough several keys. In these exercises the student's attention is\r\ndirected at random to the correct use of the registers, to nasal\r\nresonance, forward emission, etc. This consumes ten or twelve minutes of\r\nthe lesson time. More elaborate exercises on scale passages are then\r\nsung, lasting another five minutes. These are followed by a vocalise or\r\ntwo, and a couple of songs or arias, which fill out the thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nExample 2: A few breathing exercises are practised, followed by single\r\ntones and short scale passages, the whole lasting about five minutes.\r\nThen the student is drilled for some ten minutes on \"placing the head\r\ntones,\" in the manner described in the section on special vowel and\r\nconsonant drills. These exercises are varied by swelling the high tone,\r\nby changing the vowels, and by elaborating the descending scale\r\npassages. The remaining fifteen minutes are devoted to vocalises and\r\nsongs.\r\n\r\nExample 3: This is an advanced pupil, whose voice is supposed to be\r\nfairly well \"placed.\" Technical exercises of some difficulty are sung,\r\ncovering a range of an octave and a half, or a little more. The teacher\r\ninterrupts occasionally to say \"Sing those lower notes more in the chest\r\nvoice,\" \"Place the upper notes higher in the head,\" \"Don't let your\r\nvocal cords open on that ah,\" \"Sing that again and make the tones\r\ncleaner,\" etc. One or two arias are then sung, interspersed with\r\ninstructions of the same sort, and also with suggestions regarding\r\nstyle, delivery, and expression.\r\n\r\nFor daily practice between lessons, the student sings usually the same\r\nexercises and studies included in the previous lesson, and also commits\r\nto memory compositions assigned for future study.\r\n\r\nExamples of this kind might be multiplied indefinitely, but the main\r\npoints have been fairly well brought out. Most important to be noticed\r\nis the fact that the voice is trained by practice in actual singing. In\r\nthe whole scheme of modern Voice Culture, toneless muscular drills\r\nconsume only an insignificant proportion of the time devoted to lessons.\r\nFurther, the number of exercises and musical compositions embraced in a\r\nsingle half-hour lesson is very small. On the other hand, no limit can\r\nbe set to the number of topics of vocal control touched on in any one\r\nlesson. These latter are used, throughout the whole range of\r\ninstruction, without any systematic sequence. Whatever fault of\r\nproduction the pupil's tones indicate, the teacher calls attention to\r\nthe fault, and gives the supposedly appropriate rule for its\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nA CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF MODERN METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL VOCAL MANAGEMENT AS THE BASIS OF VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the wide diversity of opinion on most topics connected\r\nwith vocal training, there is one point on which all authorities agree.\r\nThis is, that the voice must be consciously controlled. In all the\r\nconflict of methods, this basic mechanical idea has never been attacked.\r\nOn the contrary, it is everywhere accepted without question as the\r\nfoundation of all instruction in singing.\r\n\r\nThe idea of mechanical vocal control is also the starting-point of all\r\nanalysis of the vocal action. Every investigator of the voice approaches\r\nthe subject in the belief that an exact determination of the muscular\r\noperations of correct singing would lead to an absolutely infallible\r\nmethod of training voices. The problem of tone-production is identical,\r\nin the common belief, with the problem of the vocal action. Three\r\nsciences, anatomy, mechanics, and acoustics, are believed to hold\r\nsomewhere among them the secret of the voice. All investigation has\r\ntherefore been carried on along the lines of these three sciences. It is\r\non this account that modern methods are called scientific, and not\r\nbecause they are in conformity with general scientific principles.\r\nBefore taking up the question whether the idea of mechanical vocal\r\ncontrol is well grounded in fact and reason, let us consider further the\r\ninfluence of this idea on modern methods of instruction.\r\n\r\nAll instruction in singing is intended to teach the student to \"do\r\nsomething,\" in order that the vocal organs may be directly caused to act\r\nproperly. No matter how vague and indefinite the directions given, their\r\naim is always to inform the student what to do, how to guide the vocal\r\naction. Even when used in a purely empirical way the directions for open\r\nthroat, etc., are always given in this spirit. That these directions are\r\nutterly meaningless in the mechanical sense does not alter the fact;\r\nnobody has ever found any other connection in which they would take on a\r\ndefinite meaning.\r\n\r\nIn this regard the empirical directions are no more unsatisfactory than\r\nthe mechanical doctrines of the accepted Vocal Science. It was pointed\r\nout that no means has ever been discovered for applying several of these\r\ndoctrines in practical instruction. The rules contained in the\r\ntheoretical works on Voice Culture for managing the registers and\r\nvocal-cord action, for forward emission of tone, and for control of the\r\nresonance cavities, are of no value whatever to the student of singing.\r\nIt will be asked, how does the conscientious teacher get over this\r\ndifficulty? How are the deficiencies of the scientific doctrines\r\nsupplied in instruction? In many cases the deficiency is absolutely\r\nignored. The student is simply told to \"make the vocal cords act\r\nproperly,\" to \"direct the tone against the roof of the mouth,\" to \"bring\r\nin the nasal resonance,\" etc., and no further help is given. That this\r\nworks severe hardship on the earnest student need hardly be mentioned.\r\n\r\nOther teachers, as has been explained, rely on a description of the\r\nsinger's sensations, and on the use of several vowel and consonant\r\ncombinations, for imparting control of resonance and forward emission.\r\nThese means are purely empirical makeshifts, and as a rule they are not\r\nsanctioned by the consistent advocates of scientific instruction. But\r\nfor acquiring control of the correct vocal-cord action, absolutely no\r\nmeans has ever been found, scientific or empirical. On this, the\r\nsurpassingly important feature of the vocal action, Vocal Science has\r\nthrown no light whatever.\r\n\r\nIt was also remarked that the strictly scientific idea of Voice Culture\r\nis very seldom carried out, to its logical conclusion, in actual\r\ninstruction. One important reason for this is that a student seldom\r\nremains long enough with a teacher to cover the entire ground of\r\nmechanical instruction. Students move about from teacher to teacher. In\r\nthe class of any one master the proportion of pupils who have never had\r\nany previous instruction does not average one in ten. To carry the idea\r\nof averages further, the length of time a student takes lessons of one\r\ninstructor may be set down as seldom more than two years.\r\n\r\nHow long it would take to apply the complete system of mechanical vocal\r\ntraining has never been precisely stated. Cases are on record of pupils\r\nbeing kept on mechanical drills and elementary exercises for four\r\nyears, without being allowed to attempt a simple song. But these\r\ninstances are extremely rare. It seldom happens that a teacher can hold\r\na pupil long enough to carry out the complete course of mechanical\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nThere are however many teachers who try conscientiously to have their\r\npupils pay attention to all the mechanical features of the vocal action.\r\nWhat it would mean to sing in this way can only be imagined. Before\r\nstarting a tone, the singer would prepare by taking a breath in some\r\nprescribed way, and retaining this breath an instant by holding the\r\nchest walls out. Meanwhile the lips, tongue, soft palate, and larynx\r\nwould each be placed in the correct position. The jaw would be held\r\nrelaxed, and the throat loose and open. The expected tone would be felt,\r\nin imagination, high up in the head, to assure the proper influence of\r\nnasal resonance. The vocal cords would be held in readiness to respond\r\ninstantly to the mental command, so as to assure the exact state of\r\ntension necessary. Preparation would be made to direct the \"column of\r\nvocalized breath,\" through the pharynx and mouth, to the proper point\r\non the hard palate. Then, at the same precise instant, the breath would\r\nbe started, and the vocal cords would be brought together, but without\r\ntouching.\r\n\r\nSo the tone would be begun. And all this would have to be done, with due\r\nattention to each operation, in the fraction of a second preceding the\r\nstarting of the tone! The downright absurdity of this idea of singing\r\nmust be apparent to any one who has ever listened to a great singer.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the idea of mechanical vocal management there is\r\nlittle room for choice between voice culture along empirical lines, and\r\nthe accepted type of scientific instruction. Modern empirical voice\r\ntraining has little practical value. Describing to the student the\r\nsensations which ought to be felt, does not help in the least. Even if\r\nthe sensations felt by the singer, in producing tone correctly, are\r\nentirely different from those accompanying any incorrect use of the\r\nvoice, nothing can be learned thereby. The sensations of correct singing\r\ncannot be felt until the voice is correctly used. An effect cannot\r\nproduce its cause. Correct tone-production must be there to cause the\r\nsensations, or the sensations are not awakened at all. Nothing else can\r\nbring about the sensations of correct singing, but correct singing\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFurther, these sensations cannot be known until they are actually\r\nexperienced. No description is adequate to enable the student to feel\r\nthem in imagination. And, finally, even if the sensations could be\r\ndescribed with all vividness, imagining them would not influence the\r\nvocal organs in any way. This is true, whether the description is given\r\nempirically, or whether it is cited to explain a mechanical feature of\r\nthe vocal action. Instruction based on the singer's sensations is\r\nabsolutely valueless.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that modern methods contain very little of real worth. The\r\ninvestigation of the mechanical operations of the voice can hardly be\r\nsaid to have brought forth anything of definite value to the vocal\r\nteacher. But this is not the worst that can be said about the mechanical\r\ndoctrines of tone-production. When critically examined, and submitted to\r\na rigid scientific analysis, several of these doctrines are found to be\r\nerroneous in conception. These are the theories of breath-control, chest\r\nresonance, nasal resonance, and emission of tone. It will be observed\r\nthat these doctrines comprise more than half of the materials of the\r\naccepted Vocal Science. Yet notwithstanding the fact that they are\r\naccepted without question by the great majority of vocal theorists as\r\nimportant elements of instruction in singing, each of these doctrines\r\ninvolves a distinct misconception of scientific principles. An\r\nexamination of these doctrines is therefore the next subject to be\r\nundertaken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FALLACY OF THE DOCTRINE OF BREATH-CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Mandl advanced the statement that the laryngeal muscles are too\r\nweak to withstand the pressure of a powerful expiratory blast, the\r\ntheory of the vocal action therein embodied met with immediate\r\nacceptance. This idea is so plausible that it appeals to the thoughtful\r\ninvestigator as self-evident, and seems to call for no proof. The\r\ndoctrine of breath-control was at once adopted, by the most influential\r\nvocal scientists, as the basic principle of tone-production.\r\n\r\nCuriously, neither Dr. Mandl, nor any other advocate of breath-control,\r\nseems to have read an article by Sir Charles Bell dealing with this same\r\naction, the closing of the glottis against a powerful exhalation. This\r\npaper, \"On the Organs of the Human Voice,\" was read before a meeting of\r\nthe London Philosophical Society on February 2, 1832.\r\n\r\nDr. Bell dispels all the mystery concerning the closure of the glottis,\r\nand the holding of the breath against a powerful contraction of the\r\nexpiratory muscles. He points out that this action occurs in accordance\r\nwith the law of the distribution of pressure in a fluid body, commonly\r\nknown as Pascal's law of fluid pressures.\r\n\r\nPascal's law is stated as follows:--\"Pressure exerted anywhere upon a\r\nmass of fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions, and acts\r\nwith equal force on all equal surfaces, and in a direction at right\r\nangles to those surfaces.\" (Atkinson's _Ganot's Physics_, 4th ed., New\r\nYork, 1869.)\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic press furnishes the familiar illustration of this law. Two\r\nvertical cylinders, one many times larger than the other, are connected\r\nby a pipe. The cylinders are fitted with pistons. Both the cylinders,\r\nand the pipe connecting them, are filled with water, oil, air, or any\r\nother fluid; the fluid can pass freely from one cylinder to the other,\r\nthrough the connecting pipe. Suppose a horizontal section of the smaller\r\ncylinder to measure one square inch, that of the larger to be one\r\nhundred square inches. A weight of one pound on the smaller piston will\r\nbalance a weight of one hundred pounds on the larger. If a downward\r\npressure of one pound be exerted on the smaller piston, the larger\r\npiston will exert an upward pressure of one hundred pounds. Conversely,\r\na downward pressure of one hundred pounds, exerted on the larger piston,\r\nwill effect an upward pressure of only one pound on the smaller piston.\r\n\r\nA type of the hydraulic press is presented by the chest cavity and the\r\nlarynx, considered as one apparatus. This fact is illustrated in the\r\nfollowing quotation: \"If a bladder full of water be connected with a\r\nnarrow upright glass tube, heavy weights placed on the bladder will be\r\nable to uphold only a very small quantity of liquid in the tube, this\r\narrangement being in fact a hydraulic press worked backwards. If the\r\ntube be shortened down so as to form simply the neck of the bladder, the\r\ntotal expulsive pressure exerted by the bladder upon the contents of the\r\nneck may seem to be very small when compared with the total pressure\r\nexerted over the walls of the bladder upon the whole contents.\" (_A Text\r\nBook of the Principles of Physics_, Alfred Daniell, London, 1884.)\r\n\r\nThat the glottis-closing muscles are too weak to withstand a powerful\r\nexpiratory pressure is therefore an entirely erroneous statement. Owing\r\nto the small area of the under surfaces of the vocal cords, the air\r\npressure against them is very small, in comparison with the total\r\npressure exerted on the contents of the thorax by the expiratory\r\ncontraction. The glottis-closing muscles are fully capable of\r\nwithstanding this comparatively slight pressure. The doctrine of\r\nbreath-control is therefore scientifically untenable. This doctrine has\r\nno place in Vocal Science.\r\n\r\nAs the basic doctrine of breath-control is unsound, the singer does not\r\nneed any direct means for controlling the breath. The attempt to check\r\nthe flow of the breath in any mechanical way is entirely uncalled for.\r\nThis being the case, it is hardly to be expected that the systems\r\ndevised to meet this fancied need would stand the test of scientific\r\nexamination. Each of these systems of breath-control, opposed muscular\r\naction and ventricular, is in fact found on analysis to embody a\r\nmisconception of scientific principles.\r\n\r\n_Opposed-Action Breath-Control_\r\n\r\nA curious misapprehension of mechanical processes is contained in the\r\ndoctrine of breath-control by opposed muscular action. This can best be\r\npointed out by a consideration of the forces brought to bear on a single\r\nrib in the acts of inspiration and expiration. One set of muscles\r\ncontract to raise this rib in inspiration, an opposed set, by their\r\ncontraction, lower the rib for the act of expiration. In the\r\nopposed-action system of breath-control, the action of the rib-raising\r\nmuscles is continued throughout the expiration, as a check upon the pull\r\nin the opposite direction of the rib-lowering muscles. Theoretically,\r\nthe downward pull is \"controlled\" by the upward pull. To express this\r\nidea in figures, let the expiratory or downward pull on the rib be said\r\nto involve the expenditure of five units of strength. According to the\r\ntheory of opposed-action breath-control, this downward pull would have\r\nto be opposed by a slightly less upward pull, say four units of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nThus graphically presented, the fallacy of the \"opposed-muscular\" theory\r\nis clearly exposed. The rib is lowered with a degree of strength equal\r\nto the excess of the downward over the upward pull. If the downward pull\r\nequals five units of strength, and the upward pull four units, the rib\r\nis lowered with a pull equivalent to one unit of strength. Exactly the\r\nsame effect would be obtained if the downward and upward pulls were\r\nequal respectively to twenty and nineteen units, or to two and one\r\nunits. Further, the result would be the same if the downward pull\r\ninvolved the exertion of one unit of strength, and there was no upward\r\npull whatever. In every case, the actual result is equivalent to the\r\nexcess of the downward over the upward pull.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the expiratory pressure of five units of strength being\r\n\"controlled\" by an inspiratory contraction of four units, nine units of\r\nstrength are exerted, and the same result could be obtained by the\r\nexertion of one unit. There is a clear waste of eight units of strength.\r\nThe power of the expiratory blast is just what it would be if one unit\r\nof strength were exerted in an \"uncontrolled\" expiration. The singer\r\nexerts just nine times as much strength as is necessary to effect the\r\nsame result. This is why the practice of breath-control exercises is so\r\nextremely fatiguing.\r\n\r\nSo far as the effect of the expiratory blast on the vocal cords is\r\nconcerned, \"controlling\" the breath has no influence whatever. The vocal\r\ncords respond to the effective air pressure; they are not affected in\r\nany way by the opposed contractions of the breath muscles.\r\n\"Opposed-muscular\" breath-control is a sheer waste of time and effort.\r\n\r\nProbably no particular harm has ever resulted to any singer's throat\r\nfrom the practice of breath-control exercises. But the attempt to hold\r\nback the breath has a very bad effect on the singer's delivery. The\r\n\"breath-control\" type of singer is never found in the ranks of the great\r\nartists. There is something utterly unnatural about this holding back of\r\nthe breath, repugnant to every singer endowed with the right idea of\r\nforceful and dramatic delivery. The vast majority of the successful\r\npupils of \"breath-control\" teachers abandon, very early in their\r\ncareers, the tiresome attempt to hold back the breath. These singers\r\nyield, probably unconsciously, to the instinctive impulse to sing freely\r\nand without constraint.\r\n\r\nBut in the ranks of the minor concert and church singers are many who\r\ntry conscientiously to obey the instructions of the \"breath-control\"\r\nteachers. Singers of this type can always be recognized by a curious\r\nimpression of hesitancy, or even timidity, conveyed by their tones. They\r\nseem afraid to deliver their phrases with vigor and energy; they do not\r\n\"let their voices out.\" Frequently their voices are of excellent\r\nquality, and their singing is polished and refined. But these singers\r\nnever give to the listener that sense of satisfaction which is felt on\r\nhearing a fine voice freely and generously delivered.\r\n\r\nAs for the particular fallacy contained in the theory of ventricular\r\nbreath-control, that must be reserved for a later chapter. Suffice it to\r\nsay here that this theory disregards the two basic mechanical principles\r\nof tone-production,--Pascal's law, and the law of the conservation of\r\nenergy. The application of this latter physical law to the operations of\r\nthe vocal organs is considered in Chapter VI of Part III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FALLACIES OF FORWARD EMISSION, CHEST RESONANCE, AND NASAL RESONANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Morell Mackenzie's analysis of the acoustic principle supposedly\r\ninvolved in \"forward emission\" has already been quoted. That this\r\nanalysis involves a complete misunderstanding of the laws of acoustics\r\nneed hardly be said. When stated in precise terms, the fallacy of the\r\n\"forward emission\" theory is evident:\r\n\r\n\"On issuing from the vocal cords the tone is directed in a curved path,\r\naround the back of the tongue. There the tone is straightened out, and\r\nmade to impinge on the roof of the mouth at a precisely defined point.\r\nFrom this point the tone is reflected, not directly back, as it should\r\nbe, since the angles of incidence and reflection must be equal. Instead\r\nof this, the tone is reflected forward, out of the mouth, necessarily\r\nagain taking a curved path, to avoid striking the front teeth.\"\r\nNaturally, no muscular action has ever been defined for causing the\r\ntone to perform this remarkable feat.\r\n\r\nThe \"forward emission\" theory assumes the existence of a current of air,\r\nissuing from the vocal cords as a tone. In other words, the tone is\r\nsupposed to consist of a stream of air, which can be voluntarily\r\ndirected in the mouth, and aimed at some precise point on the roof of\r\nthe mouth. This is an utter mistake.\r\n\r\nThere is no \"column of vibrating air,\" or \"stream of vocalized breath,\"\r\nin the mouth during tone-production. In the acoustic sense, the air in\r\nthe mouth-pharynx is still air, not air in a current. The only motion\r\nwhich takes place in the air in this cavity is the oscillatory swing of\r\nthe air particles. To imagine the directing of air vibrations in the\r\nmouth, as we direct a stream of water out of a hose, is absurd.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the \"forward tone\"? There must be some reason for this\r\nwell-known effect of a perfectly produced voice,--the impression made on\r\nthe hearer that the tones are formed in the front of the mouth. There\r\nought also to be some way for the singer to learn to produce tones of\r\nthis character. A consideration of this feature of the vocal action is\r\nreserved for Chapter IV of part III.\r\n\r\n_Chest Resonance_\r\n\r\nWho was originally responsible for the doctrine of chest resonance, it\r\nwould be impossible now to determine. Were it not for the fact of this\r\ndoctrine having received the support of eminent scientists (Holmes,\r\nMackenzie, Curtis, and many others), it might be looked upon as a mere\r\nfigure of speech. That the tones of the voice are reinforced by the\r\nresonance of the air in the chest cavity, is an utter absurdity. In the\r\nacoustic sense, the thorax is not a cavity at all. The thorax is filled\r\nwith the spongy tissue of the lungs, not to mention the heart. It is no\r\nbetter adapted for air resonance than an ordinary spherical resonator\r\nwould be, if filled with wet sponges.\r\n\r\n_Nasal Resonance_\r\n\r\nEnough was said of the theories of nasal resonance in Chapter IV of Part\r\nI to show the unscientific character of all these theories. It remains\r\nonly to point out the misconception of acoustic principles, contained in\r\nall the discussions of the subject. This is very much the same as in\r\nthe theory of \"forward emission,\" viz., that the tones of the voice\r\nconsist physically of a \"stream of vocalized breath.\" The mistaken idea\r\nis, that nasal resonance results from part or all of the expired breath\r\npassing through the nose.\r\n\r\nWhat is nasal resonance? How is it caused? What is its effect on the\r\ntones of the voice? These questions have never been answered. It can\r\nhowever be proved that a satisfactory science of Voice Culture is not in\r\nany way dependent on obtaining an answer to these questions. This much\r\nis definitely known:\r\n\r\n1. If the resonance of the air in the nasal cavities exerts any\r\ninfluence on the tones of the voice, this influence cannot be increased,\r\ndiminished, or prevented by any direct action on the part of the singer.\r\nShutting off the entrance of the breath, by raising the soft palate, is\r\npossible as a muscular exercise. But it is impossible to perform this\r\naction, and to sing artistically, at the same time. To produce any kind\r\nof tone, while holding the soft palate raised, is extremely difficult.\r\nIn a later chapter it will be seen that this action has no place\r\nwhatever in the correct use of the voice.\r\n\r\n2. As the nasal cavities are fixed in size and shape, the singer cannot\r\ncontrol or vary any influence which they may exert as a resonator.\r\n\r\n3. Independent of any thought or knowledge of how the nasal quality of\r\ntone is caused, the singer has perfect voluntary control over this\r\nquality by the simple, direct influence of the will. A singer may\r\nproduce nasal tones, or tones free from this faulty sound, at will, with\r\nno thought of the mechanical processes involved. All that is required is\r\nthat the singer have an ear keen enough to recognize the nasal quality\r\nin his own voice, as well as in the voice of any other singer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE FUTILITY OF THE MATERIALS OF MODERN METHODS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the strictly scientific or mechanical materials of modern methods,\r\nfour have been seen to be utterly erroneous. The remaining topics of\r\ninstruction, mechanical and empirical, may with equal justice be\r\nsubmitted to a similar examination.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these topics have already been critically examined. The rules\r\nfor registers and laryngeal management were seen to be of no value to\r\nthe student of singing. So also was it observed that all instruction\r\nwhich attempts to utilize the singer's sensations is futile. All that is\r\nleft of the materials of modern methods, in which any valuable idea\r\nmight be contained, are the rules for breathing.\r\n\r\nWithout undertaking to decide whether one system of breathing can be\r\nright, to the exclusion of all other systems, one general remark can be\r\napplied to the whole subject. It has never been scientifically proved\r\nthat the correct use of the voice depends in any way on the mastery of\r\nan acquired system of breathing. True, this is the basic assumption of\r\nall the discussions of the singer's breathing. As Frangçon-Davies justly\r\nremarks,--\"All combatants are agreed on one point, viz., that the\r\nsinger's breath is an acquired one of some kind.\" (_The Singing of the\r\nFuture_, David Frangçon-Davies, M.A., London, 1906.) This is purely an\r\nassumption on the part of the vocal theorists. No one has ever so much\r\nas attempted to offer scientific proof of the statement.\r\n\r\nFurther, it is frequently stated that the old Italian masters paid much\r\nattention to the subject of breathing; the assumption is also made that\r\nthese masters approached the subject in the modern spirit. Neither this\r\nstatement, nor the assumption based on it, is susceptible of proof. Tosi\r\nand Mancini do not even mention the subject of breathing.\r\n\r\nBreathing has been made the subject of exhaustive mechanical and\r\nmuscular analysis, for one reason, and for only one reason. This is,\r\nbecause the action of breathing is the only mechanical feature of\r\nsinging which can be exhaustively studied. The laryngeal action is\r\nhidden; the influence of the resonance cavities cannot well be\r\ndetermined. But the whole muscular operation of breathing can be readily\r\nseen and studied; any investigator can personally experiment with every\r\nconceivable system.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the adoption of any system of breathing has no influence\r\nwhatever on the operations of the voice. A student of singing may learn\r\nto take breath in any way favored by the instructor; the manner of\r\ntone-production is not in the least affected. Even if the correct use of\r\nthe voice has to be acquired, the mode of breathing does not contribute\r\nin any way to this result.\r\n\r\nAll that need be said in criticism of the various doctrines of breathing\r\nis, that the importance of this subject has been greatly overestimated.\r\nBreath and life are practically synonymous. Nothing but the prevalence\r\nof the mechanical idea has caused so much attention to be paid to the\r\nsinger's breathing. A tuba player will march for several hours in a\r\nstreet parade, carrying his heavy instrument, and playing it fully half\r\nthe time; yet the vocal theorist does not consider him an object of\r\nsympathy.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the acquirement of healthy habits of breathing is of great\r\nbenefit to the general health. But this does not prove that correct\r\nsinging demands some kind of breathing inherently different from\r\nordinary life. To inspire quickly and exhale the breath slowly is not an\r\nacquired ability; it is the action of ordinary speech. Singing demands\r\nthat the lungs be filled more quickly than in ordinary speech, and\r\nperhaps a fuller inspiration is also required. This is readily mastered\r\nwith very little practice. It does not call for the acquirement of any\r\nnew muscular movements, nor the formation of any new habits.\r\n\r\nWhat is left of all the materials of modern vocal instruction? To sum\r\nthem up in the order in which they were considered in Part I:\r\n\r\nBreathing does not need to be mastered in any such way as is stated in\r\nthe theoretical works on the voice. Breath-control is a complete\r\nfallacy. The doctrines of registers and laryngeal action are utterly\r\nvalueless. Chest resonance, nasal resonance, and forward emission, are\r\nscientifically erroneous. The traditional precepts are of no value,\r\nbecause nobody knows how to follow or apply them. Empirical teaching\r\nbased on the singer's sensations is of no avail.\r\n\r\nIn other words, modern methods contain not one single topic of any value\r\nwhatever in the training of the voice. It will be objected that this\r\nstatement is utterly absurd, because many of the world's greatest\r\nsingers have been trained according to these methods. No doubt this is\r\nin one sense true; modern methods can point to many brilliant successes.\r\nBut this does not prove anything in favor of the materials of modern\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nSingers are trained to-day exactly as they were trained two hundred\r\nyears ago, through a reliance on the imitative faculty. The only\r\ndifference is this: In the old days, the student was directly and\r\nexpressly told to listen and to imitate, while to-day the reliance on\r\nthe imitative faculty is purely instinctive. A fuller consideration of\r\nthe important function of imitation as an unrecognized element of modern\r\nVoice Culture is contained in Chapter V of Part IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ERROR OF THE THEORY OF MECHANICAL VOCAL MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA fundamental difference was pointed out, at the close of the preceding\r\nchapter, between the old Italian method and modern systems of vocal\r\ninstruction. This is worthy of repetition. The old Italian method was\r\nfounded on the faculty of imitation. Modern methods have as their basis\r\nthe idea of conscious, direct, mechanical control of the vocal organs.\r\nAll the materials of instruction based on this idea of mechanical\r\ncontrol were seen to be absolutely valueless. It is now in order to\r\nexamine still further the structure of modern Voice Culture, and to test\r\nthis basic idea of mechanical control.\r\n\r\nAs a muscular operation, the actions of singing must be subject to the\r\nsame physiological and psychological laws which govern all other\r\nvoluntary muscular actions. What are these laws? How do we guide and\r\ncontrol our muscular movements? At first sight, this seems a simple\r\nquestion. We know what we want to do, and we do it. But the important\r\npoint is, how are we able to do the things we want to do? You wish to\r\nraise your hand, for example, therefore you raise it. How does your hand\r\nknow that you wish to raise it? Does the hand raise itself? Not at all;\r\nit is raised by the contraction of certain muscles in the arm, shoulder,\r\nand back. That is, when you wish to raise your hand, certain muscles\r\ncontract themselves. But these muscles are not part of the hand. What\r\nleads these muscles in the shoulder and back to contract, when you will\r\nto raise your hand? Normally you are not even aware of their\r\ncontraction. Yet in some way these muscles know that they are called on\r\nto contract, in response to the wish to raise the hand. This takes\r\nplace, even though you know nothing whatever of the muscles in question.\r\nThe process is by no means so simple, when looked at in this light.\r\n\r\nA complicated psychological process is involved in the simplest\r\nvoluntary movements. This is seen in the following analysis:\r\n\r\n\"To move any part of the body voluntarily requires the following\r\nparticulars: (1) The possession of an educated reflex-motor mechanism,\r\nunder the control of the higher cerebral centers which are most\r\nimmediately connected with the phenomena of consciousness; (2) certain\r\n_motifs_ in the form of conscious feelings that have a tone of pleasure\r\nor pain, and so impel the mind to secure such bodily conditions as will\r\ncontinue or increase the one, and discontinue or diminish the other; (3)\r\nideas of motions and positions of the bodily members, which previous\r\nexperience has taught us answer more or less perfectly to the _motifs_\r\nof conscious feeling; (4) a conscious fiat of will, settling the\r\nquestion, as it were, which of these ideas shall be realized in the\r\nmotions achieved and positions attained by these members; (5) a central\r\nnervous mechanism, which serves as the organ of relation between this\r\nact of will and the discharge of the requisite motor impulses along\r\ntheir nerve-tracts to the groups of muscles peripherally situated.\"\r\n(_Elements of Physiological Psychology_, Geo. T. Ladd, New York, 1889.)\r\n\r\nLet us again consider the action of raising the hand, and see how the\r\npsychological analysis applies in this movement. We note in the first\r\nplace that we are concerned only with the third, fourth, and fifth\r\nparticulars of Prof. Ladd's analysis. These are:\r\n\r\nThe idea of the movement.\r\n\r\nThe fiat of will which directs that this movement be performed.\r\n\r\nThe discharge of the requisite motor impulses, along the nerve-tracts,\r\nto the muscles whose contraction constitutes the movement.\r\n\r\nIt will be simpler, and will answer the purpose equally well, to combine\r\nthe third and fourth elements, and to consider as one element the idea\r\nof the movement and the fiat of will to execute the movement.\r\n\r\n_The Idea of a Movement_\r\n\r\nThe mental picture of a purposed movement is simple and direct. No\r\nreference is involved to the muscles concerned in the performance of the\r\nmovement. When you will to raise your hand, the action is pictured to\r\nyour mind as the raising of the hand, and nothing more. Certain muscles\r\nare to be contracted. But the mental picture of the movement does not\r\nindicate what these muscles are, in what order they are to be brought\r\ninto play, nor the relative degrees of strength to be exerted by each\r\nmuscular fiber. You do not consciously direct the muscles in their\r\ncontractions.\r\n\r\n_The Discharge to the Muscles of the Nerve Impulse_\r\n\r\nHow then are the muscles informed that their contraction is called for?\r\nThey have no independent volition; each muscular fiber obeys the impulse\r\ntransmitted to it by the nerve, from the nerve center governing its\r\naction. These nerve centers are in their turn controlled by the central\r\nnervous mechanism. And in complex voluntary movements the central\r\nnervous mechanism is under the control of the higher cerebral centers.\r\nThe wish to raise the hand appears to the mind as an idea of the hand\r\nbeing raised. This idea is translated by the central nervous mechanism\r\ninto a set of motor nerve impulses. Does consciousness or volition come\r\ninto play here? Not at all. On this point Prof. Ladd remarks: \"As to the\r\ndefinite nature of the physical basis which underlies the connection of\r\nideas of motion and the starting outward of the right motor impulses,\r\nour ignorance is almost complete.\"\r\n\r\nIs it necessary for the performance of a complex muscular action that\r\nthe individual know what muscles are involved and how and when to\r\ncontract them? No; this knowledge is not only unnecessary, it is even\r\nimpossible. Prof. Ladd says of this: \"It would be a great mistake to\r\nregard the mind as having before it the cerebral machinery, all nicely\r\nlaid out, together with the acquired art of selecting and touching the\r\nright nervous elements in order to produce the desired motion, as a\r\nskilful player of the piano handles his keyboard.\"\r\n\r\nHow then are the muscles informed of the service required of them? Or\r\nmore precisely, how does the central nervous mechanism know what\r\ndistribution of nerve impulses to make among the different nerve centers\r\ngoverning the muscles? As Prof. Ladd says, our ignorance on this point\r\nis almost complete. There resides in the central nervous mechanism\r\ngoverning the muscles something which for lack of a better name may be\r\ncalled an instinct. When a purposeful movement of any part of the body\r\nis willed, the mental picture of the movement is translated by the\r\ncentral nervous mechanism into a succession of nerve impulses; these\r\nimpulses are transmitted through the lower centers to the muscles. The\r\ninstinct informing the central nervous mechanism how to apportion the\r\ndischarges of nerve impulse among the various muscular centers is to a\r\nhigh degree mysterious. The present purpose will not be served by\r\ncarrying the analysis of this instinct further.[7]\r\n\r\n[Note 7: The evolutionary development of this instinct is not\r\naltogether mysterious. Science can fairly well trace the successive\r\nsteps in the development of the central nervous mechanism, from the\r\namoeba to the highest type of vertebrate. \"Nerve channels\" are worn by\r\nthe repeated transmission of impulses over the same tracts.\r\nCoördinations become in successive generations more complex and more\r\nperfect. As consciousness develops further, in each succeeding type,\r\nactions originally reflex tend to take on a more consciously purposeful\r\ncharacter. But all we are concerned with now is the problem of\r\ntone-production. Our purpose is best served by accepting the faculty of\r\nmuscular adaptation as an instinct, pure and simple.]\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no direct conscious guidance of the muscles, in any\r\nmovement, simple or complex. So far as the command of voluntary muscular\r\nactions is concerned, the first simple statement of the process sums up\r\nall that for practical purposes need be determined;--we know what we\r\nwant to do, and we do it. The mind forms the idea of an action and the\r\nmuscles instinctively respond.\r\n\r\nBut the fact remains that the muscles need to be guided in some way. We\r\ndo not perform instinctively many complex actions,--writing, dancing,\r\nrowing, swimming, etc. All these actions, and indeed most of the\r\nactivities of daily life, must be consciously learned by practice and\r\nrepeated effort. How are these efforts guided? To arrive at an answer to\r\nthis question let us consider how a schoolboy practises his writing\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nThe boy begins by having before him a copy of the letters he is to\r\nwrite. Under the guidance of the eye the hand traces these letters. At\r\neach instant the eye points out to the hand the direction in which to\r\nmove. As the hand occasionally wanders from the prescribed direction the\r\neye immediately notes the deviation and bids the hand to correct it. The\r\nhand responds to the demands of the eye, immediately, without thought on\r\nthe boy's part of nerve impulse or of muscular contraction. By repeated\r\nefforts the boy improves upon his first clumsy attempts; with each\r\nrepetition he approaches nearer to the model.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this progress the muscular sense gradually comes to the\r\nassistance of the eye as a sort of supplementary guidance. But at no\r\ntime is the eye relieved of the responsibility of guiding the hand in\r\nwriting. To sum this up, the movements of the hand in writing are\r\nguided, so far as the consciousness is aware, directly by the sense of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nWe have here the law of voluntary muscular guidance. In all voluntary\r\nmovements the muscles are guided in their contractions, through some\r\ninstinctive process, by the sense or senses which observe the movements\r\nthemselves, and more especially, the results of the movements. In most\r\nactions the two senses concerned are sight and muscular sense. The more\r\nan action becomes habitual the more it tends to be performed under the\r\nguidance of muscular sense, and to be free from the necessity of the\r\nguidance of the eye. But muscular sense does not usually rise so high\r\ninto consciousness as sight, in the guidance of muscular activities.\r\nMany oft-repeated movements, especially those of walking, become\r\nthoroughly habitual and even automatic; that is, the muscular\r\ncontractions are performed as purely reflex actions, without conscious\r\nguidance of any kind. But even in walking, the necessity may at any\r\ninstant arise for conscious guidance. In such a case the sense of sight\r\nimmediately comes into service; from reflex the movements become\r\nvoluntary, and consciously guided. In the case of most complex actions\r\nthe sense of sight furnishes the most important guidance.\r\n\r\nIf the muscular operations of singing are subject to the general laws of\r\npsychological control, the guidance of the vocal organs must be\r\nfurnished by the sense which observes the results of the movements\r\ninvolved. This is the sense of hearing. Just as in writing the hand is\r\nguided by the eye, so in singing the voice is guided by the ear. There\r\ncan be no other means of guiding the voice. Muscular sense may under\r\ncertain conditions supplement the sense of hearing, but under no\r\ncircumstances can muscular sense assume full command. The net result of\r\nthe application of psychological principles to the problem of\r\ntone-production is simply this, that the voice is guided directly by the\r\near.\r\n\r\nIt is thus seen that the idea of mechanical vocal management is utterly\r\nerroneous. On pushing the analysis still further the fallacy of this\r\nidea is found to be even more glaring.\r\n\r\nIs a knowledge of anatomy of any assistance in the acquirement of skill\r\nin performing complex muscular actions? Not in the least. An\r\nunderstanding of muscular processes does not contribute in any way to\r\nskilful execution. The anatomist does not play billiards or row a boat\r\none whit the better for all his knowledge of the muscular structure of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nEven if the precise workings of the vocal mechanism could be determined,\r\nthe science of Voice Culture would not benefit thereby. Knowing how the\r\nmuscles should act does not help us to make them act properly. It is\r\nutterly idle to tell the vocal student that as the pitch of the voice\r\nrises the arytenoid cartilages rotate, bringing their forward surfaces\r\ntogether, and so shortening the effective length of the vocal cords.\r\nWhatever the vocal cords are required to do is performed through an\r\ninstinctive obedience to the demands of the mental ear.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, a precise analysis of muscular contractions is impossible,\r\neven in the case of comparatively simple actions. When, for example,\r\nthe hand describes a circle in the air, a number of muscles are\r\ninvolved. True, it is known what these muscles are, and what effect the\r\ncombined contractions of any group would have on the position of the\r\nhand. The direction of the hand's motion at any instant is determined by\r\nthe resultant of all the forces exerted on this member. But as this\r\ndirection constantly changes, so must the relative degrees of strength\r\nexerted by the muscles also constantly change. At no two successive\r\ninstants are the muscular adjustments the same. This simple action,\r\nperformed without thought or knowledge of the muscular processes,\r\npresents features too complex to be analyzed on the basis of mechanical\r\nlaw and anatomic structure.\r\n\r\nA complete analysis of the muscular operations of tone-production is\r\nabsolutely impossible. The adjustments of the laryngeal muscles involve\r\nprobably the most minute variations in degree of contraction performed\r\nin the whole voluntary muscular system. What we do know of the\r\nmechanical operations of the voice is exceedingly interesting, and a\r\nfurther knowledge of the subject is greatly to be desired. But we can\r\nnever hope to clear up all the mystery of the vocal action.\r\n\r\nThis statement must not be construed to mean that the study of the vocal\r\nmechanism has been devoid of valuable results. On the contrary, the\r\npresent understanding of the mechanical operations of the voice will be\r\nfound of very great value in erecting a true science of Voice Culture.\r\nThe only weakness of the present results of vocal investigation is due\r\nto the fact that this investigation has always been carried on under the\r\ninfluence of the idea of mechanical vocal management. This influence has\r\nled all theoretical students of the subject to attempt to apply their\r\nknowledge in formulating rules for direct mechanical guidance of the\r\nvoice. That these rules are valueless is due solely to the fundamental\r\nerror involved in the mechanical idea.\r\n\r\nVoice Culture must be turned from the idea of mechanical vocal\r\nmanagement. The old Italian masters were right in that they relied, even\r\nthough empirically, on the imitative faculty. Modern teachers may do\r\nbetter, for in the light of present knowledge reliance on the faculty of\r\nvocal imitation can be shown to be in strict accord with sound\r\nscientific principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart III\r\n\r\nTHE BASIS OF A REAL SCIENCE OF VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE MEANS OF EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION OF THE VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo all knowledge obtained through the observation of facts and\r\nphenomena, the term empirical is properly applied. Empirical knowledge\r\nmust be the basis of every science. To be available in forming a\r\nscience, empirical knowledge of a subject must be so carefully gathered\r\nthat all probability of error is eliminated; the observations must be so\r\nexhaustive as to embrace every possible source of information. From the\r\nknowledge thus obtained a set of verified general rules must be worked\r\nout with which all the observed facts and phenomena are shown to be in\r\naccord. Then a science has been erected. There is no possibility of\r\nconflict between empirical and scientific knowledge. The discovery of a\r\nsingle fact, at variance with the supposed general laws bearing on any\r\nsubject, is sufficient to overthrow the entire structure which had been\r\naccepted as a science.\r\n\r\nIn the accepted Vocal Science the terms empirical and scientific are\r\nused in a sense entirely different from that which properly attaches to\r\nthese words. Present knowledge of the operations of the voice is called\r\nscientific, solely because it is derived from the sciences of anatomy,\r\nacoustics, and mechanics. The term \"empirical knowledge of the voice\" is\r\nused as a name for knowledge of the subject drawn from any source other\r\nthan these sciences. Yet so far as the modern vocal world seems to be\r\naware, it possesses no knowledge of the voice other than that commonly\r\ncalled scientific. It is supposed that the old Italian masters had some\r\n\"empirical understanding of the voice.\" But, if this was the case, their\r\nempirical knowledge has apparently been utterly lost.\r\n\r\nThus far in the present work, the usage of the terms empirical and\r\nscientific, accepted by vocal theorists generally, has been adopted. A\r\ndistinction has been drawn between knowledge of the voice obtained\r\nthrough the study of the vocal mechanism and that obtained through\r\nobservation of any other kind. The purpose will best be served by\r\ncontinuing this same usage.\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent to the reader, from the analysis of modern methods,\r\nthat no real Science of Voice has thus far been erected. This is due to\r\nthe fact that the general principles of scientific investigation have\r\nnot been applied to the study of the voice. Under the influence of the\r\nidea of mechanical vocal management the attention of all investigators\r\nhas been turned exclusively to the mechanical features of\r\ntone-production. Meanwhile the empirical knowledge of the old masters\r\nseems to have been forgotten. As a matter of fact, as will now be seen,\r\nthis empirical knowledge has never been lost. Every modern teacher of\r\nsinging shares the empirical knowledge which formed the sole material of\r\nthe old method. But this knowledge is not applied effectually in modern\r\ninstruction for two reasons. First, modern teachers do not realize the\r\nimportance of this knowledge; indeed, they are practically unaware of\r\nthis valuable possession. Although in fact the basis of nearly all\r\nmodern instruction in singing, empirical knowledge is always\r\nunconsciously used. Second, empirical knowledge is always applied in the\r\nprevailing mechanical spirit. The attempt is always made to translate\r\nthe sub-conscious empirical understanding of the voice into rules for\r\ndirect mechanical management. Under the influence of the mechanical idea\r\nthe modern teacher's most valuable possession, empirical knowledge of\r\nthe voice, becomes utterly unserviceable.\r\n\r\nThus far, the whole result of this work has been destructive. The\r\naccepted Vocal Science has been shown to be erroneous in its conception\r\nand unsound in its conclusions. The work cannot halt here. Vocal Science\r\nmust be reconstructed. This can be done only by following the general\r\nplan of all scientific investigation, beginning with the observation of\r\nall ascertainable facts bearing on the voice.\r\n\r\nHow can any facts be observed about the voice other than by the study of\r\nthe vocal mechanism? An answer to this question is at once suggested so\r\nsoon as scientific principles are applied to the subject. Strictly\r\nspeaking, the voice is a set of sounds, produced by the action of the\r\nvocal organs. The scientific method of inquiry is therefore to begin by\r\nobserving these sounds. Sounds as such can be observed only by the sense\r\nof hearing. It follows then that the attentive listening to voices is\r\nthe first step to be taken.\r\n\r\nCan any empirical knowledge of the voice be obtained by the mere\r\nlistening to voices? If so, we ought now to be in possession of any\r\nfacts which might be thus observed. Is it possible that information of\r\nthis character is already a common possession of the vocal world, and\r\nyet that this information has never been applied in the investigation of\r\nthe voice? This is exactly the case. Many facts regarding the voice have\r\nbeen observed so continually that they are a matter of common knowledge,\r\nand yet these facts have never been recorded in a scientific manner.\r\n\r\nConsider, for example, this remark about a famous singer, made by one of\r\nthe foremost musical critics of the United States: \"Mme. T---- 's lower\r\nmedium notes were all sung with a pinched glottis.\" How did this critic\r\nknow that the singer had pinched her glottis? He had no opportunity of\r\nexamining her throat with the laryngoscope, nor of observing her throat\r\naction in any other way. In fact, the critic was seated probably\r\nseventy-five feet from the artist at the time the tones in question were\r\nsung. The critic had only one means of knowing anything about the\r\nsinger's throat action, and that was contained in the sound of the\r\ntones. There must therefore have been something in the sound of the\r\ntones which conveyed this information to the critical listener. For many\r\nyears this gentleman had been in the habit of listening closely to\r\nsingers, and he had found some way of estimating the singer's throat\r\naction by the character of the tones produced.\r\n\r\nThis same means of judging the manner of production from the sound of\r\nthe tones seems to have been utilized nearly two hundred years ago.\r\nSpeaking of the most frequent faults of tone-production, Tosi remarks:\r\n\"The voice of the scholar should always come forth neat and clear,\r\nwithout passing through the nose or being choked in the throat.\" Mancini\r\nalso speaks of the faults of nasal and throaty voice: \"Un cantare di\r\ngola e di naso.\" A throaty tone, therefore, impressed these writers as\r\nbeing in some way formed or caught in the singer's throat. It may be set\r\ndown as certain that no pupil ever explained to either of these masters\r\nhow the objectionable sounds were produced. How then did Tosi and\r\nMancini know the manner in which a throaty tone is produced?\r\n\r\nWe need not go back to the early writers to find out what is meant by a\r\nthroaty tone. Fully as many throaty singers are heard nowadays as the\r\nold masters ever listened to. What do we mean when we say that a\r\nsinger's voice is throaty? The answer to this question seems at first\r\nsight simple enough: The tones impress us as being formed in the\r\nsinger's throat. But what conveys this impression? Something in the\r\nsound of the tone, of course. Yet even that is not enough. How can a\r\ntone, merely a sound to which we listen, tell us anything about the\r\ncondition of the singer's throat during the production of the tone? Here\r\nagain the answer seems simple: The listener knows that, in order to\r\nproduce a tone of like character, he would have to contract his own\r\nthroat in some way.\r\n\r\nHere we have a highly significant fact about the voice. On hearing a\r\nthroaty tone, the listener can tell how this tone is produced; he feels\r\nthat he would have to contract his own throat in order to produce a\r\nsimilar tone. Let us carry this discussion a little further. How does\r\nthe listener know this? Certainly not by actually singing a throaty\r\ntone. When seated in a concert hall, for example, and listening to a\r\nthroaty singer, the hearer cannot rise from his seat, sing a few throaty\r\ntones himself, and then note how his throat feels. The critic just\r\nmentioned did not sing some notes with \"pinched glottis\" in order to\r\nlearn how Mme. T---- sang her low tones. Evidently it is not necessary\r\nactually to imitate the singer; the hearer gets the same result by\r\nimitating the sounds mentally. In other words, when we hear throaty\r\ntones we mentally imitate these tones; thus we know that we should have\r\nto contract our own throats in order to produce similar tones.\r\n\r\nBut even here we cannot stop. To imitate the singer actually is one\r\nthing; mental imitation is something entirely different. In the first\r\ncase, actual imitation, our muscular sense would inform us of the state\r\nof throat tightening. But in the case of mental imitation there is no\r\nactual tightening of the throat, nothing, at any rate, comparable to\r\nwhat takes place in actual imitation. There is then a dual function of\r\nthe imagination; first, the mental imitation of the sound; second, the\r\nimaginary tightening of the throat. The analysis of the mental process\r\nmust therefore be modified, and stated as follows: When we listen to a\r\nthroaty tone we mentally imitate the tone; an imaginative function of\r\nthe muscular sense informs us what condition the singer's throat assumes\r\nfor the production of the tone.\r\n\r\nA similar operation takes place in listening to nasal voices. An\r\nimpression is conveyed by a nasal tone, through which the hearer is\r\ninformed of a condition of tightness or contraction somewhere in the\r\nsinger's nose.\r\n\r\nThe terms applied to the two most marked forms of faulty\r\ntone-production, nasal and throaty, are derived from impressions\r\nconveyed by the sounds of the tones. These names, nasal and throaty,\r\nrefer to a feeling of tightness or contraction experienced in\r\nimagination by the hearer; in one case this feeling is located in the\r\nnose, in the other, in the throat. But the terms nasal and throaty are\r\ngeneral descriptions of faulty tones. Each one covers a wide range of\r\ntone qualities. There is an almost infinite variety of throaty tones,\r\nand of nasal sounds as well. The knowledge of the voice obtained by\r\nlistening to vocal tones is of equally wide extent. Every throaty tone,\r\nwhatever its precise character, informs the hearer of the exact\r\ncondition of the singer's throat in producing the tone. In short, every\r\nvocal tone is thus analyzed by the critical listener, and referred in\r\nimagination to his own throat. An insight into the singer's vocal action\r\nis imparted to the hearer through an imaginative process which always,\r\nof necessity, accompanies the attentive listening to vocal tones.\r\n\r\nEvery vocal tone awakens in the hearer a set of imagined muscular\r\nsensations. These sensations furnish the means for an exhaustive\r\nanalysis of the operations of the voice. The production of tone\r\ntherefore awakens two sets of muscular sensations, one actually felt by\r\nthe singer, the other felt in imagination by the listener. The former\r\nare commonly known as the \"singer's sensations\"; but, as will be\r\nexplained later, this expression is often very loosely applied. It is\r\nadvisable on this account to give a new name to the singer's sensations,\r\nand also to give a name to the muscular sensations awakened in the\r\nhearer. Let us therefore call the sensations experienced by the singer\r\nin the production of tone the \"direct sensations of tone.\" To the\r\nimaginary sensations of the hearer let us give the name, the\r\n\"sympathetic sensations of tone.\"\r\n\r\nThese two terms will be used throughout the remainder of this work in\r\nthe meanings here given to them.\r\n\r\nDirect sensations of tone are the sensations actually felt by the singer\r\nas a result of the exercise of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nSympathetic sensations of tone are the muscular sensations experienced\r\nin imagination by the hearer as a result of the listening to the tones\r\nof voices other than his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nSYMPATHETIC SENSATIONS OF VOCAL TONE\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiar relation of sympathy exists between the human voice and the\r\nhuman ear. So intimate is this relation that the two might almost be\r\nconsidered as forming one complete organ. One aspect of this relation\r\nhas already been noted, the guidance of the vocal organs by the sense of\r\nhearing. There is now to be considered another feature of this relation\r\nbetween voice and ear,--the assistance rendered by the vocal organs to\r\nthe sense of hearing.\r\n\r\nThat a sub-conscious adjustment of the vocal organs may supplement the\r\nsense of hearing in the estimation of pitch is mentioned by Prof. Ladd.\r\nSpeaking of the ability, by no means uncommon, to tell the pitch of any\r\nmusical note heard, Prof. Ladd says: \"Such judgment, however, may be,\r\nand ordinarily is, much assisted by auxiliary discriminations of other\r\nsensations which blend with those of the musical tone. Among such\r\nsecondary helps the most important are the muscular sensations which\r\naccompany the innervation of the larynx and other organs used in\r\nproducing musical tones. For we ordinarily innervate these organs (at\r\nleast in an inchoate and partial way)--that is, we sound the note to\r\nourselves--when trying carefully to judge of its pitch.\" (_Elements of\r\nPhysiological Psychology._)\r\n\r\nMuch more important in the study of the problem of tone-production are\r\nthe adjustments of the hearer's vocal organs which were named the\r\nsympathetic sensations of tone. This peculiar auxiliary to the sense of\r\nhearing calls for the closest attention.\r\n\r\nSympathetic sensations of tone are awakened in the hearer through the\r\nmere listening to the sounds of the human voice. Vocal tones impress the\r\nlistener's ear in a manner entirely different from any other sounds. Not\r\nonly are the tones of the voice heard, just as other sounds are heard;\r\nin addition to this, every vocal tone heard is mentally imitated, and\r\nthis mental reproduction of the tone is referred in imagination to the\r\nhearer's own vocal organs. Besides hearing the vocal tone as a sound\r\npure and simple, the listener is also informed of the manner of throat\r\naction by which the tone is produced.\r\n\r\nThis mental imitation and judgment of vocal tones is not a voluntary\r\noperation. On the contrary it cannot even be inhibited. It is impossible\r\nfor us to listen to the voices of those about us, even in ordinary\r\nconversation, without being to some extent aware of the various modes of\r\ntone-production.\r\n\r\nThis idea of the mental imitation of voices may impress us at first as\r\nhighly mysterious. Sympathetic sensations of tone have been felt and\r\nnoted, probably ever since the human voice and the human ear were\r\ndeveloped. Yet the process is purely sub-conscious. It is performed\r\ninvoluntarily, without thought on the part of the hearer, even without\r\nany consciousness of the process. The hearer simply knows how the voices\r\nto which he listens are produced. A throaty voice simply sounds throaty;\r\nthe hearer feels this, and pays no attention to the source of the\r\ninformation. We take it as a matter of course that a nasal voice seems\r\nto come through the speaker's nose. Why a certain quality of sound gives\r\nthis impression we never stop to inquire. The impressions of throat\r\naction conveyed by other people's voices seem so simple and direct that\r\nnobody appears to have thought to analyze the psychological process\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nThis psychological process is found on analysis to be highly complex. In\r\naddition to the actual physical exercise of the sense of hearing, three\r\ndistinct operations are performed in imagination. These are the mental\r\nimitation of the tone, the imagined adjustments of the vocal organs, and\r\nthe imaginative exercise of the muscular sense. Although simultaneously\r\nperformed, each of these four operations may be considered separately.\r\n\r\n_Hearing_\r\n\r\nAs the judgment of vocal tones by sympathetic sensations is purely a\r\nfunction of the sense of hearing, the keenness of these sensations\r\nvaries in each individual in proportion to the keenness of the ear. It\r\nwould be a great mistake to assert that we all feel these sympathetic\r\nsensations with equal vividness. On the contrary, many people are so\r\ninattentive to the qualities of sounds that they hardly know the meaning\r\nof the term \"nasal tone.\"\r\n\r\nOne trait in particular distinguishes the musician and the music lover;\r\nthis is, the possession of a keen sense of hearing. The ear is trained\r\nby exercise in its own function,--hearing. The more attentively we\r\nlisten to music the higher do we develop our ability to discriminate\r\nbetween musical sounds. Moreover, natural endowments vary in different\r\nindividuals, with regard to the ear, as with all other human faculties.\r\nTo appreciate fully the wonderful insight into vocal operations conveyed\r\nby the sympathetic sensations of tone, a naturally keen musical ear is\r\nrequired; further, this natural gift of a good ear must be developed by\r\nattentive listening to music, vocal and instrumental, carried on through\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\n_Mental Imitation of Vocal Tones_\r\n\r\nThat every sense has its counterpart in the imagination need hardly be\r\nsaid. We know what it means to feel warm or cold, hungry or thirsty; we\r\nknow the taste of an apple, the scent of a rose. We can at will create\r\npictures before the mind's eye. In the same way we can hear in\r\nimagination any sound we choose to produce mentally.\r\n\r\nAn inseparable function of the sense of hearing is the impulse to\r\nimitate mentally the tones of speakers and singers. The imitation of\r\nsounds is an instinctive operation. \"Talking proper does not set in till\r\nthe instinct to _imitate sounds_ ripens in the nervous system.\" (_The\r\nPrinciples of Psychology_, Wm. James, N. Y., 1890.) Little can be said\r\nabout the impulse to imitate voices mentally, further than that it is an\r\nexercise of this same instinct.\r\n\r\n_Imagined Adjustments of the Vocal Organs_\r\n\r\nIt has already been seen that the vocal organs have the ability to\r\nadjust themselves, through instinctive guidance, for the production of\r\nany tone demanded by the ear. This same ability is invoked in the mental\r\nimitation of tones. In one case the muscular contractions are actually\r\nperformed; in the other the muscular adjustments are wholly or in part\r\nimaginary.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that actual contractions of the laryngeal muscles\r\ntake place, under certain conditions, as an accompaniment to the\r\nlistening to voices. This is evident in the case of extremely aggravated\r\nthroaty and forced voices. In listening to the harsh, raucous cries of\r\nmany street vendors, when calling out their wares, the hearer\r\nfrequently feels a sense of actual pain in his own throat.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary and unconscious contractions of the laryngeal muscles,\r\nsomewhat similar to those under consideration, are well known to\r\nexperimental psychologists. Prof. Ladd's statement that these\r\ncontractions assist the ear in the judgment of absolute pitch has\r\nalready been cited. Another example of unconscious laryngeal movements\r\nhas been investigated by Hansen and Lehmann (\"Ueber unwillkuerliches\r\nFluestern,\" _Philos. Studien_, 1895, Vol. XI, p. 47), and by H. S.\r\nCurtis (\"Automatic Movements of the Larynx,\" _Amer. Jour. Psych._, 1900,\r\nVol. XI, p. 237). The laboratory experiments of these investigators show\r\nthat when words, or ideas definitely expressed in words, are strongly\r\nthought but not uttered, the vocal organs unconsciously adjust\r\nthemselves to the positions necessary for uttering the words. Curtis\r\nsays of these unconscious laryngeal contractions: \"Such movements are\r\nvery common with normal people, and are comparatively easy of\r\ndemonstration.\"\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used by Hansen and Lehmann in their experiments consists\r\nof two large concave reflectors. These are placed at a convenient\r\ndistance, one facing the other, so that two experimenters may be seated,\r\nthe first having his mouth at the focal point of one reflector, the\r\nsecond with his ear at the focal point of the other. As the first\r\nexperimenter repeats mentally any words or phrases, these are found to\r\nbe unconsciously whispered. These sounds of whispering, inaudible under\r\nordinary conditions, are so magnified by the two reflectors as to be\r\ndistinctly heard by the second experimenter.\r\n\r\nCurtis proved that actual movements of the larynx unconsciously\r\naccompany intense thought. His demonstrations were conducted along lines\r\nfamiliar to all students of experimental psychology. Similar experiments\r\nwould probably show that unconscious movements of the larynx also occur\r\nduring the listening to vocal tones.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of the laryngeal adjustments accompanying the listening to\r\nvoices is seen in the fact that the possession of a fine or well-trained\r\nvoice is not required in this process. It does not matter whether the\r\nphysical organs are capable of producing fine musical tones. The\r\nnervous equipment alone is involved; this is frequently highly\r\ndeveloped, even though the physical voice is very poor. A keen and\r\nhighly-trained ear is the only requisite. Players in the opera\r\norchestras often develop this faculty to a high degree, even though they\r\nmay never attempt to sing a note.\r\n\r\n_Muscular Sense_\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive analysis of the various classes of sensations, commonly\r\ngrouped under the general heading of muscular sense, would involve a\r\nmass of technicalities not necessary to the present purpose. It is\r\nsufficient to bear in mind the limitations of this sense, and to notice\r\nwhat it tells us, and what it does not tell.\r\n\r\nThrough the exercise of the muscular sense we are informed of the\r\nmovements, positions, and conditions of the different parts of the body.\r\nOf specific muscular contractions very little information is conveyed.\r\nThus, when the arm is bent at the elbow the muscular sensations of the\r\nmovement are clear and definite; but, under normal conditions, these\r\nsensations do not inform us that the movement results from the\r\ncontraction of the biceps muscle. Knowledge of the muscular structure\r\nof the body is not involved in muscular sense. The muscular sensations\r\nof bending the arm are felt in precisely the same way by the professor\r\nof anatomy and the ignorant child.\r\n\r\nFurther, no amount of attention paid to muscular sensations will inform\r\nus exactly what muscles are contracted in any complex action. A single\r\nstroke in the game of tennis, returning a swift service for example, may\r\ninvolve some contraction of every muscle of the entire body. A skilful\r\nplayer may observe with the utmost care the muscular sensations\r\naccompanying this stroke; he would never be able to learn from these\r\nsensations whether the number of muscles in his forearm is ten or one\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nFor the same reason the sympathetic sensations of tone tell us nothing\r\nwhatever of the muscular structure of the vocal organs. When listening\r\nto a throaty voice, we feel that the singer's throat is tightened,\r\nstiffened, or contracted. But no matter how keen and vivid this\r\nsensation may be, it leaves us in complete ignorance of the names and\r\nlocations of the muscles wrongly contracted. This is true, however\r\nthoroughly we may know the anatomy of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nMuch of the prevailing confusion about the voice is due to a\r\nmisunderstanding of this point. When, for example, the musical critic\r\nasserted that Mme. T---- sang certain tones with \"pinched glottis,\" he\r\nfell into this error. His sympathetic sensations informed him of some\r\nunnecessary tightening of the singer's throat. From these sensations he\r\nseems to have inferred that the glottis-closing muscles were too\r\nstrongly contracted. This assumption was not warranted by any\r\ninformation conveyed in the sympathetic sensations.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary now to determine to what extent the muscular\r\nsensations accompanying the listening to voices are purely imaginative,\r\nand to what extent they result from actual, though unconscious,\r\ncontractions of the listener's throat muscles. The psychological process\r\nis the same in either case.\r\n\r\nSympathetic sensations of tone always accompany the listening to voices.\r\nWhile the psychological process is complex, this process is performed\r\nunconsciously and involuntarily. Even though the attention may be\r\ndefinitely turned to the sympathetic sensations themselves, the mental\r\nimitation and the laryngeal adjustments seldom rise into consciousness.\r\nAs a rule, the entire operation is purely sub-conscious. The listener\r\nsimply knows how the voices to which he listens are produced. This\r\nknowledge has always been accepted as intuitive; but this is merely\r\nanother way of saying that the process of its acquirement is\r\nsub-conscious.\r\n\r\n_Direct Sensations of Tone_\r\n\r\nIn addition to the source of misunderstanding of the vocal action just\r\nmentioned,--the attempt to define the precise muscular contractions\r\nindicated in the sympathetic sensations, another common\r\nmisinterpretation of these sensations must be noted. As a consequence of\r\nthe sub-conscious character of the sympathetic sensations, the two\r\nclasses of muscular sensation of vocal tone, direct and sympathetic, are\r\nfrequently confounded and classed together as the \"singer's sensations.\"\r\nA third source of confusion is seen in the attempt to apply the\r\nsympathetic sensations, by formulating rules for the guidance of the\r\nstudent, in performing specific actions for the management of the vocal\r\norgans. All three of these topics will be considered in a later chapter.\r\nBefore approaching this subject let us see just what information may be\r\nderived from the observation of the direct sensations of tone.\r\n\r\nThe direct sensations of tone are never so vivid, so precise, nor so\r\nreliable as the sympathetic sensations. In other words, the hearer is\r\nbetter able to judge of the singer's throat action than the singer\r\nhimself. This may seem a paradoxical statement, but a brief\r\nconsideration will show it to be fully justified.\r\n\r\nIn the case of teacher and pupil, it will hardly be questioned that the\r\nmaster hears the pupil's voice to better advantage than the pupil. This\r\nis also true when a trained singer's tones are observed by a competent\r\nhearer. The singer's direct sensations are highly complex. They include\r\nthe muscular sensations accompanying the exertion of the breathing\r\nmuscles, and these are usually so intense as to overshadow the\r\nsensations due to the laryngeal adjustments. On the other hand, the\r\nhearer is free to pay close attention to the sensations of throat\r\naction, and therefore feels these much more keenly than does the singer.\r\nOn this account the direct sensations of tone are of vastly less value\r\nin the study of the vocal action than are the sympathetic sensations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough attention paid to the sympathetic sensations of tone, the\r\nlistener may carry on mentally a running commentary on the throat\r\nactions of all those whose voices are heard. Continuing to use the word\r\nempirical in the sense thus far adopted, it may be said that the summary\r\nof the impressions conveyed in the sympathetic sensations of tone\r\nconstitutes empirical knowledge of the voice. In other words, empirical\r\nknowledge of the voice is an understanding of the operations of the\r\nvocal mechanism, obtained through the attentive listening to voices.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the running commentary on the throat action,\r\nmentally carried on by the listener. This mental commentary is an\r\ninseparable accompaniment of the listening to the voices of others,\r\nwhether in speech or song. As we are concerned now only with the problem\r\nof tone-production in artistic singing, our consideration will be\r\nlimited to the critical hearer's observation of the tones of singers.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine two friends to be seated side by side in the concert\r\nhall, listening to the performance of a violin sonata by an artist of\r\nabout mediocre ability. Suppose one of the friends to be a highly\r\ntrained musical critic, the other to be almost unacquainted with music\r\nof this class. Let us now inquire how the tones of the violin will\r\nimpress these two hearers; and further, let the inquiry be limited\r\nstrictly to the matter of tone, leaving out of consideration all\r\nquestions of composition and rendition.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the tones of the violin will impress these two\r\nlisteners in widely different ways. The untrained observer will greatly\r\nenjoy the beautiful tones,--supposing of course that he be gifted with a\r\nnatural fondness for music. But so far as musical value is concerned,\r\nall the tones will sound to him practically alike.\r\n\r\nFor the trained hearer, on the other hand, every note drawn by the\r\nperformer from his instrument will have a distinct value. Some of the\r\ntones will be true in pitch and perfect in quality. Some will vary\r\nslightly from the correct pitch; others will perhaps be in perfect\r\ntune, and yet be marred in quality by faults of scratching, thinness,\r\nroughness, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the two come to compare notes at the end of the performance the\r\ntrained critic will be utterly unable to convey to his friend his\r\nimpressions of the player's technique. Vividly clear as it is to the\r\ncritic, his understanding of tonal values is lodged solely in his\r\ncultivated ear. This understanding cannot be imparted in words; it must\r\nbe acquired by experience in actual listening to music.\r\n\r\nLet us now imagine this same critic to be listening to a singer, not an\r\nartist of the first rank, but one whose voice is marred by some slight\r\nfaults of production. In this case the critic will note exactly the same\r\nsort of differences in tonal value as in the case of the violinist. Some\r\nof the singer's notes will be perfect musical tones, others will be\r\nmarred by faults of intonation or of quality. But a great difference\r\nwill be noted between faulty tones played on the violin, and faulty\r\ntones sung by the human voice. In addition to their blemishes as musical\r\ntones, the faulty notes of the voice also convey to the critical\r\nlistener an idea of the state of the singer's throat in producing them.\r\n\r\nEvery blemish on the beauty of a vocal tone, every fine shade of quality\r\nwhich detracts from its perfection, indicates to the critical hearer\r\nsome faulty action of the singer's vocal organs. The more faulty the\r\nmusical character of the singer's tones the more pronounced is this\r\nimpression of faulty production. On the other hand, just so nearly as\r\nthe singer's tones approach perfection as musical sounds, so do they\r\nalso impress the ear of the critical listener as indicating the approach\r\nto the perfect vocal action.\r\n\r\nThe critic could not impart to his untrained friend the impressions made\r\nby the violinist's tones. Somewhat the same is true of the impressions\r\nmade by the tones of the voice on the critical ear. In voices of\r\nextremely nasal or throaty sound these blemishes can, of course, be\r\ndetected by the ordinary hearer. But the fine shades of difference in\r\nvocal tone quality, heard by the trained critic, cannot be noted by the\r\ninexperienced listener.\r\n\r\nThis fine ability to discriminate between musical sounds comes only\r\nthrough experience in listening to music, better still, when this has\r\nbeen combined with the actual study of music. But the ability to judge\r\nthe vocal actions of singers, through the sympathetic sensations of\r\ntone, does not depend on any actual exercise of the listener's own\r\nvoice. For the developing of this ability the exercise of the ear\r\nsuffices. The mere exercise of the ear, in listening to singers, entails\r\nalso the training of what may be called the \"mental voice.\" Attentive\r\nlistening to voices, involving as a natural consequence the\r\nsub-conscious impressions of sympathetic sensations, results in the\r\ndevelopment of a faculty to which this name, the mental voice, very\r\naptly applies.\r\n\r\nA music-lover whose experience of hearing singing and instrumental music\r\nhas been wide enough to develop the mental voice in a fair degree,\r\npossesses in this faculty a valuable means for judging singers. The\r\nmental voice carries on a running commentary on the manner of production\r\nof all the voices to which this music-lover listens. At every instant he\r\nis informed of the exact condition of the singer's throat. For him there\r\nis an almost infinite variety of throaty tones, each one indicating some\r\ndegree and form of throat tension or stiffening. A perfect vocal tone,\r\non the other hand, is _felt_ to be perfectly produced, as well as\r\n_heard_ to be musically perfect.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a highly trained sense of hearing, and the resulting\r\nfaculty of mental voice, the lover of singing has an unfailing insight\r\ninto the operations of the vocal mechanism. This understanding of the\r\nworkings of the vocal organs is the empirical knowledge of the voice.\r\n\r\nThis empirical knowledge of the voice can be possessed only by one who\r\nis equipped with a highly cultivated ear. The keener the ear the more\r\nprecise and definite is this understanding of the voice. Season after\r\nseason, as the music-lover continues to attend concerts, operas, and\r\nrecitals, his feeling for the voice becomes gradually more keen and\r\ndiscerning.\r\n\r\nFurther, empirical knowledge of the voice can be acquired in no other\r\nway than by actual experience in listening to voices. No matter how keen\r\nand definite are the impressions of throat action felt by the\r\nexperienced hearer, these impressions cannot be described to the\r\nuninitiated. In fact, these impressions are to a great extent of a\r\ncharacter not capable of being recorded in precise terms. The general\r\nnature of a throaty tone, for example, is thoroughly understood. But of\r\nthe thousands of varieties of the throaty tone no adequate description\r\ncan be given. Each observer must learn for himself to hear these fine\r\nshades of difference in tone quality.\r\n\r\nEvery experienced music lover has his own mental standard of tonal\r\nperfection. The trained ear knows how a perfect musical tone should\r\nsound, independent of the precise quality of the tone. The tone quality\r\nis determined, of course, by the instrument on which it is sounded. But\r\nalong with the individual characteristics of the sound, the tones drawn\r\nfrom every instrument, to be available in the artistic performance of\r\nmusic, must conform to the correct standard. Knowing the general musical\r\ncharacter of the tones of all instruments, the cultured hearer can at\r\nonce detect any variation from this character. Further, he knows how the\r\ntones of a badly-played instrument would sound if the instrument were\r\ncorrectly handled. An unskilled trumpeter in an orchestra, for example,\r\nmay draw from his instrument tones that are too brassy, blatant, or\r\nharsh. An observant hearer knows exactly what these tones would be if\r\nthe instrument were skilfully played.\r\n\r\nIn just the same way the mental voice has its own standard of vocal\r\nperfection. Every voice which falls below this standard is felt by the\r\ncritical hearer to be imperfectly used. When listening to a nasal singer\r\nwe know that the voice would be greatly improved in quality if the nasal\r\nsound of the tones were eliminated. We feel that the correction of the\r\nfaults of production indicated by a throaty voice would add greatly to\r\nthe beauty of the voice. More than this, we can also form some idea how\r\nan imperfectly produced voice would sound if all the faults of vocal\r\naction were to be corrected.\r\n\r\nA perfectly produced voice affects the ear in a peculiar and distinct\r\nway. Not only is such a voice free from faults; it has also, on the\r\npositive side, a peculiar character which renders it entirely different\r\nfrom any wrongly used voice. The cultured hearer is impressed with a\r\nsense of incompleteness and insufficiency in listening to a voice which\r\ndoes not \"come out\" in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. This is true,\r\neven though the voice is not marred by any distinct fault.\r\n\r\nA voice absolutely perfect in its production awakens a peculiar set of\r\nsympathetic sensations. In addition to its musical beauty such a voice\r\nsatisfies an instinctive demand for the perfect vocal action. An\r\nindescribable sensation of physical satisfaction is experienced in\r\nlistening to a perfectly managed voice.\r\n\r\nOn further consideration of this feeling of physical satisfaction\r\nawakened by a perfectly produced voice, it seems a mistake to call it\r\nindescribable. A beautiful description of this set of sympathetic\r\nsensations has been handed down to us by the masters of the old Italian\r\nschool. This description is embodied in two of the traditional precepts,\r\nthose dealing with the open throat and the support of the tone.\r\n\r\nMention of the traditional precepts leads at once to the consideration\r\nof another aspect of the empirical knowledge of the voice. Vocalists\r\nhave been attentively listening to voices since the beginning of the\r\nmodern art of singing. Although many of the impressions made by the\r\nvoice on the ear cannot be expressed in words, one set of impressions\r\nhas been clearly recorded. A marked difference was evidently noticed by\r\nthe old Italian masters between the feelings awakened in the hearer by\r\na voice properly managed and those awakened by an incorrectly produced\r\nvoice. These impressions were embodied in a set of precepts for the\r\nguidance of the singer, which are none other than the much-discussed\r\ntraditional precepts.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the traditional precepts embody the results of the old\r\nmasters' empirical study of the voice. Considered in this light, the old\r\nprecepts lose at once all air of mystery and become perfectly\r\nintelligible and coherent. To a consideration of this record of the\r\nempirical knowledge of the voice the following chapter is devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TRADITIONAL PRECEPTS OF THE OLD ITALIAN SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere should be nothing mysterious, nothing hard to understand, about\r\nthe empirical precepts. It was pointed out in Chapter V of Part I that\r\nthese precepts contain a perfect description of correctly produced vocal\r\ntone, so far as the impression on the listener is concerned. This means\r\nnothing else than that the old precepts summarize the results of\r\nempirical observation of correct singing. There is nothing new in this\r\nstatement; considered as empirical knowledge, the modern vocal teacher\r\nunderstands the meaning of the old masters' precepts perfectly well. The\r\nmisunderstanding of the subject begins with the attempt to apply the\r\nprecepts as specific rules for the direct mechanical management of the\r\nvoice. In this connection they were seen to be valueless. Let us now see\r\nif the old precepts are found to contain any meaning of value to the\r\nvocal teacher when considered as purely empirical formulæ.\r\n\r\nEach one of the precepts may be said to describe some special\r\ncharacteristic of the perfect vocal tone, considered solely as a sound.\r\nThese characteristics may each be considered separately, that is, the\r\nhearer may voluntarily pay close attention to any special aspect of the\r\nvocal tone. The best plan for arriving at the exact meaning of the\r\nprecepts is therefore to consider each one in turn.\r\n\r\n_The Forward Tone_\r\n\r\nEvery lover of singing is familiar with this characteristic of the\r\nperfectly produced voice; the sound seems to come directly from the\r\nsinger's mouth, and gives no indication of being formed at the back of\r\nthe throat. This characteristic of the perfect tone is simply heard. It\r\nis not distinguished by any sympathetic sensations, but is purely a\r\nmatter of sound. On the other hand, a wrongly produced voice seems to be\r\nformed or held in the back of the singer's throat. The tones of such a\r\nvoice do not come out satisfactorily; they seem to be lodged in the\r\nthroat instead of at the front of the mouth.\r\n\r\nIn the badly used voice the impression of throat is conveyed by the\r\nsympathetic sensations awakened in the hearer. A striking difference\r\nbetween correct and incorrect singing is thus noted. A wrongly produced\r\nvoice is felt by the hearer to be held in the singer's throat. When\r\nproperly used the voice gives no impression of throat; it seems to have\r\nno relation to the throat, but to be formed in the front of the mouth.\r\n\r\nSo much has been written about \"forward emission\" that the forward\r\ncharacteristic of vocal tones seems to be enshrouded in mystery. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the forward tone is easily explained. The perfectly\r\nproduced voice issues directly from the mouth for the same reason that\r\nthe tones of the trombone issue from the bell of the instrument. It is\r\nall a matter of resonance. This is well illustrated by a simple\r\nexperiment with a tuning fork and a spherical resonator reinforcing the\r\ntone of the fork.\r\n\r\nWhen the fork is struck, the ear hears the sound issuing from the\r\nresonator, not that coming direct from the fork. This is brought out\r\ndistinctly by placing the fork at a little distance from the resonator.\r\nThe listener can then definitely locate the source of the sound which\r\nimpresses the ear. Under these circumstances the sound coming from the\r\nresonator is found to be many times more powerful than that coming\r\ndirect from the tuning fork. If left to its own judgment the ear takes\r\nthe resonator to be the original source of the sound.\r\n\r\nIn the voice the exciting cause of the air vibrations is located at the\r\nback of the resonator,--the mouth-pharynx cavity. The sound waves in\r\nthis case can issue only from the front of the resonator,--the singer's\r\nmouth. No matter how the voice is produced, correctly or badly, this\r\nacoustic principle must apply.\r\n\r\nWhy then does not the incorrectly used voice impress the hearer as\r\nissuing directly from the mouth, the same as the correctly produced\r\ntone? This is purely a matter of sympathetic sensations of throat\r\ntightness, awakened by the faulty tone. Every wrongly used voice arouses\r\nin the listener sympathetic sensations of throat contraction. This\r\nimpression of throat, noted by the hearer, consists of muscular, not of\r\nstrictly auditory sensations.\r\n\r\nAs a statement of scientific fact, the forward-tone precept is\r\nerroneous. It does not describe scientifically the difference between\r\ncorrect and incorrect tone-production. Correctly sung tones are not\r\nproduced at the lips. Every vocal tone, good or bad, is produced by the\r\nmotion of the vocal cords and reinforced by the resonance of the\r\nmouth-pharynx cavity. Only when considered as an empirical description\r\nis the forward-tone precept of value. In this sense the precept\r\ndescribes accurately the difference in the impressions made on the\r\nhearer by correct and incorrect singing. A badly produced tone seems to\r\nbe caught in the singer's throat; the correctly used voice is free from\r\nthis fault, and is therefore heard to issue directly from the singer's\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThis marked difference between correct and incorrect tone throws a\r\nvaluable light on the meaning of the correct vocal action. Every badly\r\nused voice gives the impression of wrong or unnecessary tightness,\r\nstiffening, and contraction of the throat. When perfectly used, the\r\nvoice does not convey any such impression of throat stiffness.\r\n\r\n_The Open Throat_\r\n\r\nJust as with the forward tone, the meaning of the open throat is best\r\nbrought out by contrasting the impressions made on the hearer by a\r\nperfect and a badly used voice. A badly produced tone seems to be\r\ncaught, or as Tosi expressed it, \"choaked in the throat.\" The singer's\r\nthroat seems to be tightened and narrowed so that the sound has not\r\nsufficient passageway to come out properly. On the other hand, the\r\nperfectly used voice comes out freely, without interference or hindrance\r\nat any point in the singer's throat. There seems to be plenty of room\r\nfor the tone to come forth; in other words, the singer's throat seems to\r\nbe open.\r\n\r\nAll these impressions are purely a matter of sympathetic sensations. In\r\nlistening to a faulty singer the hearer feels a sensation of tightness\r\nand contraction of the throat. A well used voice awakens exactly the\r\nopposite sensation, that of looseness and freedom of the throat.\r\n\r\nHere again is seen the difference between correct and incorrect singing,\r\nempirically considered. Judging from the impressions made by rightly and\r\nwrongly used voices, any incorrect vocal action involves a condition of\r\ntightness and contraction of the throat. Perfect singing gives the\r\nimpression that the throat is loose and supple, and free from all\r\nunnecessary tension.\r\n\r\n_The Support of the Tone_\r\n\r\nFollowing the plan of contrasting correct and incorrect singing, the\r\nmeaning of this precept is readily found. The perfect voice is felt by\r\nthe hearer to be firmly and confidently held by the singer in a secure\r\ngrasp of the throat muscles. Such a voice awakens the sympathetic\r\nsensations of perfectly balanced muscular effect, similar to the\r\nmuscular sensations of the hand and forearm when an object is firmly\r\ngrasped in the hand.\r\n\r\nA badly used voice seems to be convulsively gripped in the singer's\r\nthroat. The tones seem to fall back into the throat for want of some\r\nsecure base on which to rest. This impression is conveyed by a peculiar\r\nset of sympathetic sensations of highly unpleasant muscular tension far\r\nback in the throat.\r\n\r\nThis precept, \"Support the tone,\" points to the difference already noted\r\nbetween the right and the wrong vocal action. Badly produced tones\r\nindicate a state of excessive tension of the throat muscles. Correct\r\nsinging gives the impression that the throat muscles exert exactly the\r\nrequisite degree of strength, and no more.\r\n\r\nTaken together, the open-throat and the forward-tone precepts embody an\r\nadmirable description of the sympathetic sensations awakened by perfect\r\nsinging. The singer's entire vocal mechanism is felt to be in a\r\ncondition of lithe and supple freedom. There is no straining, no\r\nconstraint, no forcing, no unnecessary tension. Each muscle of the vocal\r\nmechanism, and indeed of the entire body, exerts just the necessary\r\ndegree of strength.\r\n\r\nSimilar muscular sensations always accompany the expert performance of\r\nany action requiring a high degree of dexterity. Whatever be the form of\r\nexertion, skilful physical activity awakens muscular sensations of\r\nperfectly balanced and harmonized contractions. This feeling of muscular\r\npoise and adjustment is pleasurable in a high degree.\r\n\r\nA keen enjoyment is experienced in the skilful performance of many\r\ncomplex muscular activities. Much of the pleasure of skating, dancing,\r\nrowing, tennis, etc., is dependent on this feeling of muscular poise\r\nand harmonious contraction. Healthy exercise is always normally\r\nenjoyable; but skilful performance greatly enhances the pleasure. A\r\nbeginner learning to skate, for example, exerts himself fully as much as\r\nthe accomplished skater. Yet the beginner does not by any means derive\r\nthe same degree of pleasure from his exertions.\r\n\r\nPrecisely this feeling of balanced and harmonious muscular exertion is\r\nexperienced by the perfect singer. More than this, the hearer also,\r\nthrough sympathetic sensations, shares the same pleasurable feeling.\r\nThis is the sensation described as the feeling of soaring, of poise, and\r\nof floating, in many descriptions of the \"singer's sensations.\"\r\n\r\n_Singing on the Breath_\r\n\r\nWhen the voice is perfectly used the tones seem to detach themselves\r\nfrom the singer, and to float off on the breath. Nothing in the sound of\r\nthe tones, nor in the sympathetic sensations awakened, gives any\r\nindication that the breath is checked or impeded in its flow. The\r\ncurrent of tone seems to be poured out on the breath just as freely as\r\na quiet expiration in ordinary breathing.\r\n\r\nThis is a purely empirical description of perfect singing. As we know\r\nvery well, the vocal action is quite different from this description.\r\nBut the important point is that the phrase \"singing on the breath\" does\r\nvery accurately describe the impression made on the hearer by perfect\r\nsinging.\r\n\r\nSinging on the breath represents the highest possible degree of purely\r\nvocal perfection. One may attend operas and concerts for a whole season\r\nand listen to a score of famous singers, and count oneself fortunate to\r\nhave heard even one artist who attains this standard of tonal\r\nexcellence. Singing on the breath is an effect of wondrous tonal beauty;\r\nit is simply this, pure beauty, pristine and naïve.\r\n\r\nWith the slightest degree of throat stiffness or muscular tension,\r\nsinging on the breath is utterly impossible. So soon as the tones\r\nindicate the merest trace of throat contraction, the free outflow of the\r\nstream of sound is felt to be checked.\r\n\r\nColoratura singing, to be absolutely perfect, demands this degree of\r\ntonal excellence. Singing on the breath and coloratura are indeed very\r\nclosely allied. The modern school of musical criticism does not hold\r\ncoloratura singing in very high esteem. We demand nowadays expression,\r\npassion, and emotion; we want vocal music to portray definite\r\nsentiments, to express concrete feelings. Florid singing is not adapted\r\nto this form of expressiveness. It is only sensuously beautiful; it\r\nspeaks to the ear, but does not appeal to the intellect.\r\n\r\nYet it may well be asked whether the highest type of coloratura singing,\r\npure tonal beauty, does not appeal to a deeper, more elemental set of\r\nemotions than are reached by dramatically expressive singing. This\r\nquestion would call for a profound psychological discussion, hardly in\r\nplace in a work devoted to the technical problem of tone-production. But\r\nthis much is certain: Coloratura singing still has a strong hold on the\r\naffections of the music loving public. Even to-day audiences are moved\r\nby the vocal feats of some famous queen of song fully as profoundly as\r\nby the performance of a modern dramatic or realistic opera.\r\n\r\nTo describe a sound is an extremely difficult task. The tone of the\r\nmuted horn, for example, is perfectly familiar to the average musician.\r\nYet who would undertake to describe in words the tone of the muted horn?\r\nA description of the sounds produced by a perfectly managed voice is\r\nalmost as difficult to frame in words. Still the old Italian masters\r\nsucceeded in finding words to describe perfect singing. These few simple\r\nphrases--open the throat, support the tone, sing the tones forward, sing\r\non the breath--embody a most beautiful and complete description of vocal\r\nperfection. The empirical study of the voice can hardly be expected to\r\ngo further than this. From the old masters we have received a complete\r\nrecord of all that need be known empirically about the voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE IN MODERN VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out in Chapter I of Part III that there is no possibility\r\nof conflict between empirical and scientific knowledge. Modern Voice\r\nCulture seems to present a direct contradiction of this statement. The\r\nvocal teacher's empirical understanding of the voice conflicts at every\r\nstep with his supposedly scientific knowledge. No doubt the reader is\r\nalready aware of the real meaning of this apparent contradiction. It\r\nonly bears out the philosophic rule; an accepted science must be\r\nabandoned so soon as its deductions are found to be not in accord with\r\nobserved facts.\r\n\r\nModern methods of instruction in singing can be understood only by\r\nfollowing out this idea of conflict between known facts and accepted,\r\nthough erroneous, scientific doctrines. As we have seen, the only\r\nuniversally accepted theory of supposedly scientific Voice Culture is\r\nthe idea of direct mechanical guidance of the voice. Every vocal\r\nteacher attempts to make his empirical knowledge conform to this\r\nmechanical idea. As the empirical knowledge is correct, and the\r\nmechanical idea a complete mistake, conflict between the two is\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\nEvery modern teacher of singing possesses in full measure the empirical\r\nunderstanding of the voice. To this statement hardly an exception need\r\nbe made. Probably the most startling fact concerning the wide diffusion\r\nof this knowledge is that the nature of this knowledge is so thoroughly\r\nignored. Because the psychological process is purely sub-conscious,\r\nempirical knowledge is always indirectly and generally unconsciously\r\napplied. In the teacher's mind the most prominent idea is that of\r\nmechanical vocal guidance. His attention is always directly turned to\r\nthis idea. Empirical knowledge, consisting merely of a succession of\r\nauditory and muscular sensations, lurks in the background of\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nTo the intelligent vocal teacher there is something peculiarly\r\nfascinating about the study of tone-production. In listening to any\r\nfaulty singer we feel with the utmost precision what is wrong with the\r\nvoice. Each imperfect tone informs us clearly and definitely just where\r\nthe wrong muscular contraction is located. It seems so easy to tell the\r\nsinger what to do in order to bring the tone out perfectly. Under the\r\ninfluence of the mechanical idea we try to express this feeling in the\r\nterms of muscular action. This attempt is never successful; the singer\r\ncannot be brought to understand our meaning. Yet it is so clear in our\r\nown minds that our inability to express it is extremely tantalizing. We\r\ngo on, constantly hoping to find a way to define the mechanical\r\nprocesses so clearly indicated to the ear. We always feel that we are\r\njust on the verge of the great discovery. The solution of the problem of\r\ntone-production is almost within our grasp, yet it always eludes us.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in Chapter V of Part I that empirical knowledge of the\r\nvoice, based on the singer's sensations, is used to supplement and\r\ninterpret the doctrines of mechanical vocal guidance. This is in the\r\nmain true, so far as the vocal teacher is aware. But here again the\r\nresult of the sub-conscious character of empirical knowledge of the\r\nvoice is seen. As a matter of fact the real situation is the direct\r\nreverse of that described in the chapter mentioned. The mechanical\r\ndoctrines are used in the attempt to interpret the empirical knowledge.\r\nThis fact is well brought out in the following passage from Kofler: \"The\r\nteacher must imitate the wrong muscle-action and tone of his pupil as an\r\nillustration of the negative side.\" (_The Art of Breathing_, N. Y.,\r\n1889.) Kofler does not touch on the question, how the teacher is able to\r\nlocate the wrong muscle-action of the pupil. He takes this ability for\r\ngranted; it is so purely an intuitive process that he does not stop to\r\ninquire into the source of this information of the pupil's vocal action.\r\nThrough his sense of hearing he sub-consciously locates the faults in\r\nthe pupil's tone-production. His only conscious application of this\r\nknowledge is the attempt to explain to the pupil the wrong\r\nmuscle-action. This he naturally tries to do in the terms of mechanical\r\naction and muscular operation. Thus the mechanical doctrine is used in\r\nthe attempt to explain the empirical knowledge. Yet the teacher is\r\nconscious only of citing the mechanical rule, and believes this to cover\r\nthe entire instruction.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter it was seen that the perfectly produced vocal\r\ntone may be considered in a variety of aspects. Each one of these\r\naspects is characterized by a fairly distinct set of sympathetic\r\nsensations. Of faulty modes of throat action, as revealed by sympathetic\r\nsensations, there is an almost infinite variety. Of this wide variety of\r\nforms of throat tension the most prominent are those indicated by sets\r\nof sympathetic sensations, the direct opposites of those characterizing\r\nthe perfect vocal action. Thus the open throat is indicated by one set\r\nof sympathetic sensations, the lack of this characteristic of tone by an\r\nopposite set, etc.\r\n\r\nWhatever distinct fault of production the pupil's tone indicates, the\r\nmaster immediately notes the character of the faulty throat action. The\r\nmaster feels, simply and directly, what is wrong with the student's\r\ntone-production. Whence this knowledge comes he does not stop to\r\ninquire. Suppose the pupil to sing an exercise, and to produce tones\r\nwhich stick in the throat, instead of coming out freely. The master\r\nsimply hears that the pupil's voice is caught in the throat; he does not\r\nobserve that he is informed of this condition by muscular as well as\r\nauditory sensations.\r\n\r\nThis ignoring of the psychological nature of the impressions of tone is\r\nnot necessarily detrimental to successful instruction. On the contrary,\r\nthe master's empirical insight into the vocal operations of the pupil\r\nwould probably not be advanced by an understanding of the psychological\r\nprocess. It is sufficient for the teacher's purpose to hear that the\r\npupil's voice is caught in the throat. What robs this hearing, or\r\nfeeling, of all value is this: the master attempts to interpret the\r\nsensation as an indication of the need of some specific muscular action,\r\nto be directly performed by the pupil. To this end he cites the\r\nmechanical rule, assumed to be indicated by the pupil's faulty vocal\r\naction. This may be, for example, the opening of the throat to give room\r\nfor the tone to expand. It seems so perfectly simple to the\r\nteacher;--the pupil narrows his throat, and so holds in the tone; let\r\nhim expand his throat and the tone will come out freely. This conclusion\r\nseems so clearly indicated by the sound of the tones that the master\r\nalmost inevitably gives the precise instruction: \"Open your throat and\r\nlet your voice come out.\" This sums up, to the master's satisfaction,\r\neverything the pupil need do to correct this particular fault of\r\ntone-production.\r\n\r\nOther sets of sympathetic sensations, awakened by badly produced tones,\r\nare interpreted in the same manner. A tone heard to be held in the back\r\nof the throat is believed to indicate the need of bringing the voice\r\nforward in the mouth. Other forms of throaty production are taken to\r\nshow a lack of support, a wrong management of the breath, a need of\r\nbreath-control, a misuse of nasal resonance, or an improper action of\r\nthe vocal cords. In all these attempts to interpret sympathetic\r\nsensations by means of mechanical doctrines the teacher naturally relies\r\non those doctrines in which he believes most firmly. Sympathetic\r\nsensations are indeed sometimes cited in proof of certain theories of\r\nbreath-control, and also of nasal resonance. Both these topics are\r\nworthy of separate attention.\r\n\r\n_Sympathetic Sensations and Nasal Resonance_\r\n\r\nOne of the most widely accepted theories of the vocal action is that the\r\nhigher notes of the voice are influenced by reinforcing vibrations\r\nlocated in the nose and forehead. Whether this idea was derived more\r\nfrom direct than from sympathetic sensations need not be determined now.\r\nIt is at any rate certain that a perfectly sung tone gives to the hearer\r\nthe impression of nasal influence of some kind. The exact nature of this\r\ninfluence has never been determined. It may be air resonance, or\r\nsounding-board resonance, or both combined. Satisfactory proof on this\r\npoint is lacking. In the belief of the practical teacher, however, this\r\nimpression of nasal influence is the strongest argument in favor of\r\nnasal resonance.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the question of nasal quality, strictly speaking, tones\r\nof this objectionable character always awaken the sympathetic sensations\r\nof contraction somewhere in the nose. Why such a contraction should\r\ncause this unpleasant sound of the voice is a profound mystery. Perhaps\r\nwrong tension of the soft palate exerts an influence on the actions of\r\nthe vocal cords; or it may be that the form of the nasal cavities is\r\naltered by the muscular contraction. This aspect of the vocal action has\r\nnever been scientifically investigated. The sympathetic sensation of\r\nnasal contraction or pinching is at any rate very pronounced.\r\nCuriously, this sympathetic sensation is cited as an argument in favor\r\nof their respective theories, by both the advocates and the opponents of\r\nnasal resonance.\r\n\r\n_Sympathetic Sensations and Breath-Control_\r\n\r\nCertain forms of exaggerated throat stiffness are frequently held to\r\nindicate the need of breath-control. The faulty vocal action in question\r\nis analyzed by the breath-control advocates substantially as follows:\r\n\"Owing to the outflow of the breath not being checked at the proper\r\npoint, the entire vocal mechanism is thrown out of adjustment. The\r\nsinger exerts most of his efforts in the endeavor to prevent the escape\r\nof the breath; to this end he contracts his throat and stiffens his\r\ntongue and jaw. His tones are forced, harsh, and breathy; they lack\r\nmusical quality. His voice runs away with him and he cannot control or\r\nmanage it. In the attempt to obtain some hold on his voice he 'reaches'\r\nfor his tones with his throat muscles. The more he tries to regain\r\ncontrol of the runaway breath the worse does his state become.\"\r\n\r\nThis extreme condition of throat stiffness is unfortunately by no means\r\nrare. So far as concerns the sympathetic sensations awakened by this\r\nkind of singing the condition is graphically described by the\r\nbreath-control advocates. But the conclusion is entirely unjustified\r\nthat this condition indicates the lack of breath-control. Only the\r\npreconceived notion of breath-control leads to this inference. The\r\nsympathetic sensations indicate a state of extreme muscular tension of\r\nthe throat; this is about the only possible analysis of the condition.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nEmpirical impressions of vocal tones determine the character of most\r\npresent-day instruction in singing. This means no more than to say that\r\nthroughout all vocal training the teacher listens to the pupil's voice.\r\nThe impressions of tone received by the teacher's ear cannot fail to\r\ninform the teacher of the condition of the pupil's throat in producing\r\nthe voice. For the teacher to seek to apply this information in\r\nimparting the correct vocal action to the pupil is inevitable.\r\n\r\nAlmost every teacher begins a course of instruction by having the pupil\r\nrun through the prescribed series of mechanical exercises and rules.\r\nBreathing is always taken up first. Breath-control, laryngeal action,\r\nregisters, and resonance follow usually in this order. The time devoted\r\nto this course of training may vary from a few weeks to several months.\r\nThis mechanical instruction is almost always interspersed with songs and\r\narias. The usual procedure is to devote about half of each lesson to\r\nmechanical doctrines and the remainder to real singing.\r\n\r\nBlind faith in the efficacy of this mechanical training is the teacher's\r\nonly motive in giving it. Very little attention is paid to the sound of\r\nthe pupil's voice during the study of mechanical rules and doctrines. It\r\nis simply taken for granted that the voice must be put through this\r\ncourse. Once the mechanical course has been covered, the pupil's voice\r\nis supposed, in a vague way, to be \"placed.\" From that time on, whether\r\nit be at the end of two months of study or of two years, the instruction\r\nis based solely on empirical impressions of tone.\r\n\r\nLittle remains to be said of the nature of this empirical instruction.\r\nIt always retains the mechanical aspect. Whatever fault of production\r\nis noted, the teacher seeks to correct the fault by applying some\r\nmechanical rule. The futility of this form of instruction has already\r\nbeen pointed out.\r\n\r\nOnly two ways of applying empirical knowledge of the voice are known to\r\nthe modern vocal teacher. These are, first, to tell the pupil to \"open\r\nthe throat,\" or to \"support the tone,\" or to perform whatever other\r\nmechanical operation seems to be indicated as necessary by the sound of\r\nthe tone; second, to bid the student to \"feel that the tone is\r\nsupported,\" to \"feel that the throat is open,\" etc. Under these\r\ncircumstances the little advantage derived from empirical knowledge in\r\nmodern Voice Culture is readily understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE VOICE\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as any definite record can be made, the knowledge of the voice\r\nobtained by attentive listening to voices has now been set down. The\r\nnext step in the scientific study of tone-production is the\r\nconsideration of all knowledge of the voice obtained from sources other\r\nthan empirical. In other words, the knowledge of the voice usually\r\nclassed as scientific is now to be examined.\r\n\r\nThree sciences are generally held to contribute all that can possibly be\r\nknown about the vocal action. These are anatomy, acoustics, and\r\nmechanics. Of these anatomy has received by far the most attention from\r\nvocal scientists. The laws of acoustics, bearing on the voice, have also\r\nbeen carefully considered. Beyond the theory of breath-control, little\r\nattempt has been made to apply the principles of mechanics in Vocal\r\nScience. Psychology, the science most intimately concerned with the\r\nmanagement of the voice, has received almost no attention in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nA complete record of the teachings of the established sciences with\r\nregard to the voice demands the separate consideration of the four\r\nsciences mentioned. Each will therefore be treated in turn. In the case\r\nof each of these sciences it is seen that the most essential facts of\r\nthe vocal action have been definitely established. Many questions still\r\nremain to be satisfactorily answered which are of great interest to the\r\ntheoretical student of the voice. Yet in spite of the lack of exact\r\nknowledge on these points, enough is now known to furnish the basis for\r\na practical science of Voice Culture.\r\n\r\n_The Anatomy of the Vocal Mechanism_\r\n\r\nThis subject has been so exhaustively studied that nothing new can well\r\nbe discovered regarding the muscular structure of the vocal organs. In\r\nall probability the reader is sufficiently acquainted with the anatomy\r\nof the larynx and its connections. Only a very brief outline of the\r\nsubject is therefore demanded. The muscles concerned with breathing\r\ncall for no special notice in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe special organ of voice is the larynx. This consists of four\r\ncartilages, with their connecting ligaments,--the thyroid, the cricoid,\r\nand the two arytenoids, and of nine so-called intrinsic muscles,--two\r\ncrico-thyroid, right and left, two thyro-arytenoid, two posterior\r\ncrico-arytenoid, two lateral crico-arytenoid, and one arytenoideus. The\r\ninner edges of the thyro-arytenoid muscles form the vocal cords. The\r\nhyoid bone, serving as a medium of attachment for the tongue, may also\r\nbe considered a portion of the larynx. By means of the extrinsic muscles\r\nthe larynx is connected with the bones of the chest, neck, and head.\r\n\r\nWhile the muscular structure of the vocal organs is thoroughly known,\r\nthe actions of the laryngeal muscles in tone-production have never been\r\nabsolutely determined. This much is definitely established: Vocal tone\r\nis produced when the vocal cords are brought together and held on\r\ntension, and the air in the lungs is expired with sufficient force to\r\nset the vocal cords in motion. The tension of the vocal cords can be\r\nincreased by the contraction of their muscular tissues, the two\r\nthyro-arytenoid muscles; further, increased tension of the cords can\r\nalso result from the tilting of the thyroid cartilage on the cricoid, by\r\nthe contraction of the crico-thyroid muscles.\r\n\r\nIt is also definitely proved that the pitch of the vocal tone varies\r\nwith the state of tension of the vocal cords; increasing the degree of\r\ntension raises the pitch, decreasing the tension lowers it. As to the\r\nrelative importance of the different groups of muscles in varying the\r\ntension of the vocal cords, nothing has been definitely proved.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the variations in pitch resulting from variations in the\r\ntension of the vocal cords, there is also much ground for believing that\r\nthe pitch may be raised by shortening the effective length of the vocal\r\ncords. This is apparently accomplished by the rotation of the arytenoid\r\ncartilages; but the specific muscular contractions concerned in the\r\nrotation of the arytenoids have not been located.\r\n\r\nIt is generally asserted by vocal theorists that the quality of the\r\nvocal tone, on any one note, is determined mainly by the influence of\r\nthe resonance cavities. Dr. Mills says on this point: \"When it is borne\r\nin mind that the vocal bands have little or nothing to do with the\r\nquality of the tone, the importance of those parts of the vocal\r\napparatus which determine quality... becomes apparent.\" (_Voice\r\nProduction in Singing and Speaking_, 1906.) This theory that the quality\r\nof the tone is determined solely by the resonance cavities is directly\r\ncontradicted by Prof. Scripture. He proves that changes in tone quality\r\nresult from changes in vocal cord adjustment. This subject is more fully\r\ntreated in the following section. Even before this matter had been\r\ndefinitely settled by Prof. Scripture, there was a strong presumption in\r\nfavor of the vocal cord adjustment theory. Howard advanced this idea in\r\n1883. Several empirical observations support this theory. Most important\r\nof these is the fact that a single tone, swelled from _piano_ to\r\n_forte_, goes through a wide variety of changes in quality.\r\nStockhausen's mention of this fact has already been noted.\r\n\r\nThis fact tends to cast some doubt on the value of laryngoscopic\r\nobservation as a means of determining the laryngeal action. Under the\r\nconditions necessary for examination with the laryngoscope it is\r\nimpossible for the singer to produce any but soft tones in the head\r\nquality of voice. Most of these tones, if swelled to _forte_, would\r\nchange from the head to the chest quality. It is probable that this\r\nchange in quality is effected by a corresponding change in the vocal\r\ncord adjustment, as the conditions of the resonance cavities remain the\r\nsame. But this cannot be determined by laryngoscopic observation.\r\n\r\nSo far as the actions of the laryngeal muscles are concerned, no\r\ndifference can be defined between the correct vocal action and any\r\nimproper mode of operation. Sir Morell Mackenzie examined a large number\r\nof people with the aid of the laryngoscope; of these, some were trained\r\nsingers, others, while possessed of good natural voices, had had no\r\nvocal training whatever. Many variations were noted in the notes on\r\nwhich changes of register occurred. But it could not be determined by\r\nthis mode of examination whether the subject was a trained singer or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIf there is one specifically correct mode of operation for the vocal\r\ncords, this correct action has never been determined from the anatomy of\r\nthe organs. No doubt there is some difference between the muscular\r\nactions of correct tone-production and those of any incorrect operation\r\nof the voice. But the nature of this difference in muscular action has\r\nnever been discovered by means of dissections of the larynx, nor by\r\nlaryngoscopic observation.\r\n\r\n_The Acoustic Principles of Tone-Production_\r\n\r\nAn outline of the existing state of knowledge regarding the acoustic\r\nprinciples of tone-production must be drawn mainly from one source. This\r\nis the latest authoritative work on the subject, _The Study of Speech\r\nCurves_, by E. W. Scripture (Washington, 1906). In this work Prof.\r\nScripture overthrows several of the conclusions of Helmholtz which had\r\nhitherto furnished the basis of all the accepted theories of vocal\r\nacoustics. Considering the eminently scientific character of all Prof.\r\nScripture's research work, his thorough acquaintance with every detail\r\nof the subject, and the exhaustive attention devoted to this series of\r\nexperiments, we are fully justified in accepting his present statements\r\nas conclusively proved.\r\n\r\nA first impression received from a careful reading of _The Study of\r\nSpeech Curves_ is that the subject is vastly more intricate than had\r\nformerly been believed. Helmholtz's theory of vocal acoustics was fairly\r\nsimple: The vocal cords vibrate after the manner of membranous reeds; a\r\ntone thus produced consists of a fundamental and a series of overtones;\r\nvowel and tone quality are determined by the influence of the resonance\r\ncavities, which reinforce certain of the overtones with special\r\nprominence. This theory is discarded by Prof. Scripture. \"The overtone\r\ntheory of the vowels cannot be correct.\" In place of this simple theory,\r\nProf. Scripture reaches conclusions too complicated to be given in\r\ndetail here. A brief outline of the subject must suffice for the needs\r\nof the present work.\r\n\r\nProf. Scripture found that the nature of the walls of a resonating\r\ncavity is of more importance than either its size, shape, or opening. A\r\nflesh-lined cavity is capable of reinforcing tones covering a range of\r\nseveral notes. Further, the vowel sound, and presumably also the tone\r\nquality, are determined more by the action of the vocal cords than by\r\nthe adjustment of the resonance cavities. \"The glottal lips vibrate\r\ndifferently for the different vowels.\" This adjustment of the glottal\r\nlips \"presumably occurs by nervously aroused contractions of the fibers\r\nof the muscles in the glottal lips.\" Continuing, Prof. Scripture says:\r\n\r\n\"Physiologically stated, the action for a vowel is as follows: Each\r\nglottal lip consists mainly of a mass of muscles supported at the ends\r\nand along the lateral side. It bears no resemblance to a membrane or a\r\nstring. The two lips come together at their front ends, but diverge to\r\nthe rear. The rear ends are attached to the arytenoid cartilages. When\r\nthe ends are brought together by rotation of these arytenoid cartilages,\r\nthe medial surfaces touch. At the same time they are stretched by the\r\naction of the crico-thyroid muscles, which pull apart the points of\r\nsupport at the ends.\r\n\r\n\"In this way the two masses of muscle close the air passage. To produce\r\na vowel such a relation of air pressure and glottal tension is arranged\r\nthat the air from the trachea bursts the muscles apart for a moment,\r\nafter which they close again; the release of the puff of air reduces the\r\npressure in the trachea and they remain closed until the pressure is\r\nagain sufficient to burst them apart. With appropriate adjustments of\r\nthe laryngeal muscles and air pressure this is kept up indefinitely,\r\nand a series of puffs from the larynx is produced. The glottal lips open\r\npartly by yielding sidewise,--that is, they are compressed,--and partly\r\nby being shoved upward and outward. The form of the puff, sharp or\r\nsmooth, is determined by the way in which the glottal lips yield; the\r\nmode of yielding depends on the way in which the separate fibers of the\r\nmuscles are contracted.\r\n\r\n\"These puffs act on the vocal cavity, that is, on a complicated system\r\nof cavities (trachea, larynx, pharynx, mouth, nose) with variable\r\nshapes, sizes, and openings. The effect of the puffs on each element of\r\nthe vocal cavity is double: first, to arouse in it a vibration with a\r\nperiod depending on the cavity; second, to force on it a vibration of\r\nthe same period as that of the set of puffs. The prevalence of one of\r\nthe factors over the other depends on the form of the puff, the walls of\r\nthe cavities, etc.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Scripture does not undertake to point out a difference between the\r\ncorrect vocal action in tone-production, and any incorrect action. This\r\ndifference in action does not seem capable of definition by any\r\nanalysis of the acoustic principles involved.\r\n\r\n_Mechanical Principles of the Vocal Action_\r\n\r\nIn Part II, Chapter II, it was seen that the outflow of the breath in\r\ntone-production is checked by the vocal cords, in accordance with\r\nPascal's law of fluid pressures. Another law of mechanics bearing on\r\nthis operation is now to be considered, viz., the law of the\r\ntransformation and conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nThe application of the law of the transformation and conservation of\r\nenergy to the operations of the voice is nicely illustrated by the\r\nwell-known candle-flame test of (supposedly) breath-control. To perform\r\nthis test the singer is instructed to practise the exercises for\r\nbreath-control while holding a lighted candle with the flame an inch or\r\ntwo in front of the lips. According to the idea of the breath-control\r\nadvocates, the expired breath should escape so slowly, and with so\r\nlittle force, that no current of air can be detected at the lips, the\r\nexpiration therefore does not cause the candle flame to flicker.\r\n\r\nDescribing the toneless breathing exercises to be practised with the\r\ncandle flame, Browne and Behnke say, \"Let it be observed that the above\r\nexercise is quite distinct from the well-known practice of _singing_\r\nbefore a lighted candle, which is, comparatively speaking, an easy\r\nmatter.\" (_Voice, Song, and Speech_.) A very striking fact is stated\r\ncorrectly by Browne and Behnke,--there is no current of air created at\r\nthe lips during tone-production. Of the truth of this statement the\r\nreader may readily convince himself by trying this same experiment with\r\na candle flame, or even with a lighted match. Hold a lighted match just\r\nin front of the lips and sing a powerful tone. The quality of the tone\r\nis of no consequence so long as it be powerful. Just sing, shout, yell,\r\nthe louder the better. You will find that the flame is less affected\r\nunder these circumstances than by the quiet expiration of ordinary\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nConsiderable practice and close attention are required in order to hold\r\nback the breath in toneless breathing exercises. Whereas in producing\r\nany kind of powerful tone the breath normally creates no current of air\r\nat the lips.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason for considering this experiment a test of correct\r\ntone-production. It is impossible to produce a powerful tone of any\r\nkind, good, bad, or indifferent, and at the same time to create an\r\nappreciable current of air at the lips.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the breath-control theorists have entirely failed to\r\ngrasp the significance of the candle-flame experiment. Yet we have here\r\na demonstration of the mechanical law of tone-production.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a mechanical process, tone-production occurs when the\r\nenergy exerted by the expiratory muscles, in their contraction, is\r\nconverted into energy of motion of the vocal cords.[8] In other words,\r\ntone-production is an example of the transformation of energy. The law\r\nof the transformation and conservation of energy must therefore apply to\r\nthis operation. This law is stated as follows: \"Energy may be\r\ntransformed from any of its forms to any other form. When energy is thus\r\ntransformed the quantity of energy in the resulting form or forms is\r\nequal to the quantity of energy in the original form.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 8: This exposition of the mechanical principle of\r\ntone-production is intended to be graphic, rather than strictly\r\ntechnical. For the sake of simplicity, that portion of the expiratory\r\nenergy expended in friction against the throat walls, tongue, cheeks,\r\netc., is disregarded, as well as that expended in propelling the air out\r\nof the mouth, in displacing the same quantity of external air, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe mechanical operation of tone-production comprises the following\r\ntransformations of energy: First, the energy exerted in the contraction\r\nof the expiratory muscles is converted into energy of condensation or\r\nelasticity of the air in the lungs and trachea. Second, this energy of\r\ncondensation of the air is converted into energy of motion of the vocal\r\ncords. In other words, the expiratory energy is transformed into energy\r\nof motion.\r\n\r\nOne objection, at first sight very serious, may be offered against this\r\nstatement: the amount of strength exerted in the contractions of the\r\nbreath muscles seems many times greater than is accounted for in the\r\nmotion of the vocal cords. The movements of the vocal cords are so\r\nslight as to be observable only with the aid of a specially devised\r\napparatus, the stroboscope. Can all the expiratory force expended in\r\ntone-production show such a small result? This apparent objection is\r\nfound to be groundless in view of the application in this operation of\r\nPascal's law. As this topic was fully treated in Chapter II of Part II,\r\nno further explanation is required here.\r\n\r\nThe erroneous idea of vocal mechanics involved in the doctrine of\r\nbreath-control is now fully exposed. Tone can be produced only when the\r\nexpired air exerts a pressure on the vocal cords. There is no necessity\r\nfor any conscious or voluntary check on the expiration. The energy of\r\nthe expiration is expended in setting the vocal cords in motion. No\r\nenergy of condensation is left in the expired air the instant it has\r\npassed the vocal cords. Beyond that point there is no expiratory\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn one sense it is true that the expiration is \"controlled\" in\r\ntone-production. But this control is strictly an automatic action. The\r\nvocal cords are adjusted, by the appropriate muscular contractions, to\r\nmove in response to the air pressure exerted against them. This action\r\ninvolves, as a necessary consequence, the holding back by the vocal\r\ncords of the out-rushing air. So long as the vocal cords remain in the\r\nposition for producing tone, they also control the expiration. In this\r\nsense breath-control is an inseparable feature of tone-production.\r\n\r\nAll that need be known of the mechanics of the voice is therefore\r\nperfectly plain. The vocal cords are set in motion by the pressure\r\nagainst them of the expired breath. This operation is in accordance with\r\nPascal's law and the law of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nBut this analysis throws no light on the nature of the correct vocal\r\naction. It is impossible for the voice to produce a sound in any way\r\nother than that just described. In speaking or in singing, in laughing\r\nor in crying, in every sound produced by the action of the vocal cords,\r\nthe mechanical principle is always the same. Nor is the bearing of this\r\nlaw limited to the human voice. Every singing bird, every animal whose\r\nvocal mechanism consists of lungs and larynx, illustrates the same\r\nmechanical principle of vocal action.\r\n\r\nOnly passing mention is required of the fallacy of the breath-band\r\ntheory. The idea of any necessity of relieving the vocal cords of the\r\nexpiratory pressure is purely fanciful. How any one with even a slight\r\nunderstanding of mechanics could imagine the checking of the breath by\r\nthe inflation of the ventricles of Morgagni, is hard to conceive.\r\n\r\n_The Psychology of Tone-Production_\r\n\r\nThis subject was treated, in some detail, in Chapter V of Part II. In\r\nthat chapter however we were concerned more with a destructive criticism\r\nof the idea of mechanical tone-production than with the positive\r\nfeatures of vocal psychology. At the risk of some repetition it is\r\ntherefore advisable here to sum up the laws of psychology bearing on the\r\nvocal action.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a psychological process, tone-production in singing\r\ninvolves three distinct operations. First, the mental ear conceives a\r\ntone of definite pitch, quality, vowel sound, and power. Second, the\r\nvocal organs prepare to adjust themselves, by the appropriate muscular\r\ncontractions, for the production of the tone mentally conceived. Third,\r\nthe fiat of will is issued, causing the muscular contractions to be\r\nperformed. These three operations are executed as one conscious,\r\nvoluntary act. Let us inquire to what extent consciousness is concerned\r\nwith each operation.\r\n\r\nAs conscious volitional impulses, the mental conception of the tone, and\r\nthe fiat of will to produce the tone, are well enough understood. These\r\ntwo operations call for no extended consideration. We are at present\r\nconcerned only with the psychological laws bearing on the muscular\r\nadjustments of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nMuscular contractions result from the transmission to the muscular\r\nfibers of motor nerve impulses. These nerve impulses originate in the\r\nmotor nerve centers. They can never, under any circumstances, rise into\r\nconsciousness. Contractions of the voluntary muscles occur either as\r\nreflex or as voluntary actions. In both cases the motor nerve impulses\r\noriginate in the same nerve centers. In the case of reflex actions these\r\nlower muscular centers alone are involved; in voluntary actions the\r\noriginating of the motor impulses is \"controlled\" by consciousness. In\r\ndeciding that an action shall be performed, and in what way it is to be\r\nperformed, consciousness directs that each motor center involved shall\r\nsend out the appropriate discharges of nerve impulse.\r\n\r\nComplex muscular activities require the sending out of nerve impulses\r\nfrom various motor centers. Such activities are usually not performed\r\ninstantaneously, but require a longer or shorter time. Thus we may\r\nconsider it as one action for the writer to rise from his chair, to\r\nlower the window and adjust the shade, and then to return to his seat.\r\nIn this case a large number of motor centers are successively involved;\r\nat the proper instant each center discharges its impulse. To this end\r\nthe motor centers must be instructed when to come into activity.\r\n\r\nThis distribution of nerve impulse is effected by the power of\r\ncoördination. In voluntary actions coördination is accompanied by\r\nconscious control.[9] But coördination is not a function of the higher\r\ncerebral centers, that is, of consciousness. How the connection is made\r\nbetween the higher cerebral centers and the lower motor centers is a\r\ncomplete mystery. All that can be said is that the ideas of movements\r\nare transmitted to the motor centers, and that these send out the\r\nappropriate motor impulses.\r\n\r\n[Note 9: In this connection it is advisable to point out a\r\ndifference between the meanings attached to the word \"control\" in\r\npsychology and in Vocal Science. The psychologist classes habitual\r\nmovements as either automatic or controlled. Automatic movements are\r\npurely reflex; the individual does not consciously decide whether they\r\nshall be performed or not. Psychologically considered, the _control_ of\r\na movement is simply the conscious volitional decision whether the\r\nmovement shall be performed. To adopt the language of Psychology, we\r\nshould speak of _voice management_, and of _breath regulation_, instead\r\nof vocal control, breath control, etc. In the following chapters the\r\naccepted psychological usage of the word \"control\" will so far as\r\npossible be adopted.]\r\n\r\nTurning now to the muscular adjustments of the vocal organs, these\r\nadjustments are seen to be independent of conscious guidance. When a\r\ntone is mentally conceived the vocal organs adjust themselves, in\r\nresponse to some mysterious guidance, for the production of the tone.\r\nThe vocal cords assume the appropriate degree of tension according to\r\nthe pitch of the tone to be sung. Both the quality of the tone and the\r\nvowel are determined by the combined adjustments of the laryngeal\r\nmuscles and of the muscles which fix the shape and size of the resonance\r\ncavities. The power of the tone is regulated by the force of the breath\r\nblast; for each degree of power some special adjustment of the vocal\r\ncords is required.\r\n\r\nAll these adjustments are executed as one concrete and individual act in\r\nresponse to the volitional impulse contained in the mental conception of\r\nthe tone. The tone is conceived as a concrete whole. It is not normally\r\nbroken up mentally into its four aspects of pitch, quality, vowel, and\r\npower. True, each one of these four characteristics of the tone may be\r\nseparately considered by the singer. So also, to a certain extent, may\r\nthe adjustments of the vocal organs be performed with special reference\r\nto one or the other characteristic of the tone. But in every case the\r\nmuscular contractions are performed without direct conscious guidance.\r\nWhatever be the character of the tone mentally demanded, the vocal\r\norgans instantly adjust themselves to produce the tone.\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by saying that the muscular contractions are performed\r\nwithout conscious guidance? Does this mean that the singer is\r\nunconscious of the muscular contractions? Not at all. Muscular sense\r\ninforms the singer, more or less distinctly, of the state of contraction\r\nor relaxation of the various muscles of the vocal organs. The singer\r\nalways knows fairly well the condition of the various parts of the vocal\r\nmechanism. What is meant is this: The singer does not consciously direct\r\nthe vocal organs to assume certain positions and conditions, and does\r\nnot instruct the various muscles to contract in certain ways. The singer\r\ndoes not need to know, and in fact cannot know, what muscular\r\ncontractions are required to produce any desired tone.\r\n\r\nSome connection exists between the organs of hearing and the vocal\r\nmechanism. That this connection has a physical basis in the nervous\r\nstructure is fairly well established. \"The centers for sight and for arm\r\nmovements, for instance, or those of hearing and of vocal movements,\r\nhave connecting pathways between them.\" (_Feeling and Will_, Jas. M.\r\nBaldwin, 1894.) The psychological law of tone-production is that the\r\nvocal organs adjust themselves, without conscious guidance, to produce\r\nthe tones mentally conceived. In actual singing the practical\r\napplication of this law is that the voice is guided by the ear.\r\n\r\nThis guidance of the voice by the ear is incessant. It must not be\r\nunderstood that the mental ear simply conceives a single tone, and that\r\nthe vocal machinery then operates without further guidance. All the\r\ncharacteristics of the vocal tones,--pitch, quality, and power,--are\r\nconstantly changing. These changes require corresponding changes in the\r\nmuscular adjustments. The muscular contractions in turn are guided by\r\nthe demands of the mental ear. As a psychological process, singing may\r\ntherefore be analyzed as follows: The singer mentally sings the\r\ncomposition. In response to the ever varying demands of the ear the\r\nvocal organs adjust themselves to produce actually the sounds thus\r\nmentally conceived. The singer listens to these sounds and at every\r\ninstant compares them to the mental conception. If the tones actually\r\nproduced fail to correspond exactly to those mentally conceived, the\r\nsinger instantly notes this variation and bids the vocal organs to\r\ncorrect it. The ear has therefore a dual function in singing. First, the\r\nmental ear directs the voice in its operations. Second, the physical ear\r\nacts as a check or corrective on the voice.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the psychology of tone-production, the singer guides or\r\nmanages the voice by attentively listening to the tones of the voice.\r\nThis is the only possible means of vocal guidance. The voice and the ear\r\ntogether form one complete organ.\r\n\r\nBut we are still apparently as far as ever from the specific meaning of\r\nthe correct vocal action. That the voice instinctively obeys the\r\ncommands of the ear may be true theoretically. In actual practice we\r\nknow that this does not by any means always occur. Singers are often\r\nunable to get the desired results from their voices, even when they\r\nbelieve themselves to rely on the sense of hearing. There must therefore\r\nbe some influence which under certain conditions interferes with the\r\noperations of the vocal organs. The problem of tone-production is thus\r\nseen to be one of psychology. It narrows down to this: What can\r\ninterfere with the normal action of the voice and prevent the vocal\r\norgans from instinctively responding to the demands of the ear? A\r\nsatisfactory answer to this problem will be found only by a\r\nconsideration of all available knowledge of the voice, both empirical\r\nand scientific. This forms the material of the final division of the\r\npresent work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPart IV\r\n\r\nVOCAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICAL VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE CORRECT VOCAL ACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo distinct lines of approach were laid down for studying the\r\noperations of the voice. First, the manner of investigation usually\r\naccepted as scientific. This is, to study the vocal mechanism; to\r\ndetermine, as far as possible, the laws of its operation, in accordance\r\nwith the principles of anatomy, acoustics, mechanics, and psychology.\r\nSecond, the manner of investigation generally called empirical. This\r\nbegins with the observing of the tones of the voice, considered simply\r\nas sounds. From the tones we work back to the vocal organs and apply to\r\nthem the information obtained by attentive listening. Both of these\r\nmeans of investigation have been utilized; we are now in possession of\r\nthe most salient facts obtainable regarding the vocal action.\r\n\r\nSeparately considered, neither the scientific nor the empirical study of\r\nthe voice is alone sufficient to inform us of the exact nature of the\r\ncorrect vocal action. The next step is therefore to combine the\r\ninformation obtained from the two sources, scientific analysis and\r\nempirical observation. Let us begin by summing up all the facts so far\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nTone-production in singing is a conscious and voluntary muscular\r\noperation. The vocal organs consist of a number of sets of voluntary\r\nmuscles, of the bones and cartilages to which these muscles are\r\nattached, and of the nerves and nerve centers governing their actions.\r\nThe precise nature of the muscular contractions of tone-production,\r\nwhether correct or incorrect, is not known. These contractions occur in\r\naccordance with established laws of acoustics and mechanics. Under\r\nnormal conditions the vocal organs instinctively respond to the demands\r\nof the singer, through the guidance of the sense of hearing. The ability\r\nof the vocal organs to adjust themselves properly may be upset by some\r\ninfluence apparently outside the singer's voluntary control. Study of\r\nthe vocal mechanism does not inform us of the meaning of the correct\r\nvocal action, nor of the difference between this action and any other\r\nmode of operation of the voice.\r\n\r\nEmpirically considered, there is a striking difference between the\r\ncorrect vocal action and any other manner of tone-production. A perfect\r\nvocal tone awakens in the hearer a distinct set of auditory and muscular\r\nsensations. Attentively observed, the muscular sensations of the hearer\r\nindicate that the perfect vocal tone is produced by the balanced and\r\nharmonious action of all the muscles of the singer's vocal mechanism. In\r\nlistening to perfect singing the hearer feels that every muscle of the\r\nsinger's vocal organs is contracted with exactly the appropriate degree\r\nof strength. Any vocal tone of unsatisfactory sound awakens in the\r\nhearer a set of muscular sensations, the direct opposite of those\r\nindicating the correct vocal action. An incorrectly produced tone\r\nimparts to the hearer a sensation of stiffness and undue muscular\r\ntension, located more or less definitely in the throat. This sensation\r\nindicates that the singer's throat is stiffened by excessive muscular\r\ncontraction. Further, this feeling of throat stiffness indicates to the\r\nhearer that the singer's vocal action would become correct if the undue\r\nmuscular tension were relaxed.\r\n\r\nCombining now the results of empirical and scientific investigation of\r\nthe voice, throat stiffness is seen to be the interfering influence\r\nwhich disturbs the instinctive connection between voice and ear. Let us\r\nnow consider the meaning of throat stiffness as a feature of incorrect\r\ntone-production. First, what is muscular stiffness?\r\n\r\nAll the voluntary muscles of the body are arranged in opposed pairs,\r\nsets, or groups. A typical pair of opposed muscles are the biceps and\r\ntriceps of the upper arm. Contraction of the biceps flexes the forearm\r\nat the elbow; the contrary movement, extending the forearm, results from\r\nthe contraction of the triceps. This principle of opposition applies to\r\nthe entire muscular system. One set of muscles raises the ribs in\r\ninspiration, another set lowers them in expiration; one group flexes the\r\nfingers and clenches the fist, an opposed set extends the fingers and\r\nopens the hand. Muscular opposition does not imply that the entire\r\nstructure is made up of parallel pairs of muscles, like the biceps and\r\ntriceps, located on opposite sides of the same bone. It means only that\r\nthe opposed sets pull in contrary directions.\r\n\r\nEach opposed set consists of muscles of about equal strength. Under\r\nnormal conditions of relaxation the entire muscular system exerts a\r\nslight degree of contraction. To this normal state of oppositional\r\ncontraction the name \"muscular tonicity\" is given. The present purpose\r\ndoes not call for a discussion of the subject of muscular tonicity. This\r\nform of contraction has no direct bearing on the performance of\r\nvoluntary movements.\r\n\r\nWhat effect has the voluntary contraction of all the muscles of any\r\nmember, each opposed set exerting the same degree of strength? No motion\r\nof the member results, but the member is brought on tension and\r\nstiffened. This is well illustrated in the case of the arm. Extend the\r\narm and clench the fist; then contract all the muscles of the arm, about\r\nas the athlete does to display his muscular development. You will notice\r\nthat the arm becomes stiff and tense.\r\n\r\nThis state of tension is commonly called \"muscular stiffness,\" but the\r\nterm is open to objection. It is really the joints which are stiffened,\r\nnot the muscles. We are, however, so accustomed to speak of muscular\r\nstiffness, and particularly of throat stiffness, that little is to be\r\ngained by substituting a more accurate expression.\r\n\r\nA condition of muscular stiffness results from the contraction of all\r\nthe muscles of a member, whether this contraction be voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary. This condition does not prevent the normal movements of the\r\nmember; it only renders the movements more difficult and fatiguing and\r\nless effective. It is readily seen why this is the case. More than the\r\nnecessary strength is exerted by the muscles. Suppose the biceps and\r\ntriceps, for example, each to be contracted with five units of strength;\r\nthen let some work be performed by the flexing of the forearm, requiring\r\nthe exertion of two units of strength. In this case the biceps must\r\nexert two units of strength more than the triceps, that is, seven units.\r\nIn all, the two muscles together exert twelve units of strength to\r\naccomplish the effective result of two units. Six times the needed\r\nstrength is exerted. Activity of this kind is naturally fatiguing.\r\n\r\nMuscular stiffness increases the difficulty of complex movements. Not\r\nonly is unnecessary strength exerted; the stiffness of the joints also\r\ninterferes with the freedom and facility of motion. But this unfavorable\r\ncondition does not upset the power of coördination. The instinctive\r\nconnection between the nerve centers of consciousness and the motor\r\ncenters is not broken. Although hampered in their efforts, the muscles\r\nare still able to execute the demands of consciousness.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of this analysis of muscular stiffness let us\r\nconsider the actions of writing, when performed under the conditions\r\njust described. It is possible to write with the hand and arm in a state\r\nof muscular stiffness. But one does not write so easily, so rapidly, nor\r\nso well with the arm stiff as with the arm normally relaxed. Closer\r\nattention must be paid to the forming of the letters, and more effort\r\nmust be put forth to write with the muscles stiffened; yet the result is\r\nnot equal to that obtained with less care and labor under normal\r\nmuscular conditions.\r\n\r\nAll that has been said of muscular stiffness applies with especial force\r\nto the vocal organs. Like the rest of the muscular system, the muscles\r\nof the vocal organs are arranged in opposed pairs and sets. The\r\ncontraction of all the muscles of the throat, each opposed set or pair\r\nexerting about the same degree of strength, causes a condition of\r\nthroat stiffness. Singing is possible in this condition. But the\r\nsinger's command of the voice is not so complete and satisfactory as\r\nunder normal conditions.\r\n\r\nThroat stiffness does not altogether deprive the vocal organs of their\r\nfaculty of instinctive adjustment in obedience to the demands of the\r\near. To a fair extent the voice is under the command of the singer. The\r\nvocal cords adjust themselves readily enough for the desired pitch;\r\ntones of the various degrees of loudness and softness can be sung in a\r\nfairly satisfactory manner. But the muscles are somewhat hampered in\r\ntheir contractions, and the response to the demands of the ear is not\r\nquite perfect. This lack of perfect command is evidenced specially in\r\nthe quality of the tones. Some form of throaty quality always mars the\r\nvoice when the throat is in a stiffened condition. In this regard the\r\nvoice refuses to fulfill the demands of the ear. Even though the singer\r\nhears, and indeed feels, the effects of the muscular tension, and\r\nstrives to remedy the fault of production, the voice still refuses to\r\nrespond.\r\n\r\nThis incomplete command of the voice is frequently observed, even among\r\nsingers of very high standing. At first sight the condition here\r\ndescribed seems to disprove the statement that the voice normally obeys\r\nthe ear. But there is no real contradiction of the psychological law of\r\nvocal command in the case of a stiff-throated singer. For one thing,\r\nwhatever degree of command the singer possesses is obtained in\r\naccordance with the law of guidance by the ear. Moreover, the failure to\r\nsecure perfect response is due solely to the interference with the\r\nnormal workings of the voice, occasioned by the state of throat\r\nstiffness. Far from this form of muscular contraction being a\r\ncontradiction of psychological principles, it will be found on\r\nexamination to be in perfect accord with well-established laws of\r\nphysiological psychology.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be supposed that the singer consciously and voluntarily\r\ncontracts the muscles of the entire vocal mechanism and so deliberately\r\nbrings about the stiffening of the throat. True, this can readily be\r\ndone. We can at will sing throaty and nasal tones. But this form of\r\nvoluntary throat tension is not, properly speaking, an incorrect vocal\r\naction. So long as the vocal organs respond to the demands of the ear,\r\nthe vocal action is correct. Only when the voice refuses to obey can\r\nthe action be described as incorrect.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory definition of the various modes of vocal action can now\r\nbe given. The correct vocal action is the natural operation of the vocal\r\norgans; the voice normally obeys the commands of the ear. An incorrect\r\nvocal action occurs when the throat is stiffened by the involuntary\r\ncontraction of the muscles of the vocal mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis definition of the vocal action does not solve the problem of\r\ntone-production. It is still to be determined how the involuntary\r\ncontraction of the throat muscles is caused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THROAT STIFFNESS AND OF INCORRECT VOCAL ACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nInvoluntary contractions of the voluntary muscles can occur only as\r\nreflex actions. If the muscles of the vocal organs are subject to\r\ninvoluntary contractions, the causes of these contractions must be\r\nsought through an investigation of the subject of reflex actions.\r\n\r\nReflex actions are of several kinds; of these the simplest type, and the\r\none most easily studied, is the muscular contraction due to the\r\nexcitation of the sensory nerve endings located in the skin. Thus when\r\nthe sole of the foot of a sleeping person is tickled, the leg is at\r\nfirst drawn up and then violently kicked out. An exhaustive discussion\r\nof the physiological and psychological features of reflex action is not\r\ncalled for here; a sufficient understanding of the subject may safely be\r\nassumed to be possessed by the reader.\r\n\r\nInvoluntary muscular contractions often occur as reflex actions without\r\nany direct or tactual irritation of the sensory nerve endings. Several\r\nexamples of this form of reflex action are now to be considered. These\r\nactions will be seen to be matters of such common experience as to call\r\nfor no special proof. They are the following:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Reflex actions performed under the influence of sensory\r\nimpressions other than those of touch or muscular sense.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Involuntary muscular contractions due to nervousness.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Contractions of the muscles of certain members, caused by the\r\nturning of the attention specially to the members.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Involuntary contractions of muscles, accompanying the exertion of\r\nother associated and antagonist muscles, and due to the radiation of\r\nnerve impulse.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Reflex Actions due to Sensory Impressions other than those of\r\nTouch or Muscular Sense_\r\n\r\nA wide range of movements is included under this heading. Of these it is\r\nnecessary to mention only a few, such as the sudden start on the hearing\r\nof an unexpected noise, the instinctive movement of dodging to escape an\r\napproaching missile, and the raising of the arm to ward off an expected\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nActions of a somewhat similar character normally occur in which it is\r\nnot easy to point to the excitation of any sense or senses. These\r\ninclude the instinctive cowering attitude of fear, the play of facial\r\nexpression caused by sentiment and emotion, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Involuntary Actions due to Nervousness_\r\n\r\nA condition of marked nervousness generally causes the involuntary\r\ncontraction of muscles. Who does not recall his earliest attempts at\r\n\"speaking a piece\" in school? The trembling of the lips, the twitching\r\nof the arms and hands, and the vain attempts to govern the bodily\r\nmovements, are an experience painful even in the recollection.\r\n\r\nMovements and contractions due to nervousness are entirely purposeless;\r\nthey even defy the most earnest efforts at inhibition. A marked feature\r\nof this type of involuntary action is the contraction of antagonist\r\ngroups of muscles, productive of muscular stiffness of the members.\r\n\r\nAn extreme example of this form of nervousness is offered by the\r\nunfortunate sufferer from stage fright. In this condition the entire\r\nbody often stiffens, and purposeful movement of any kind becomes for a\r\ntime impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Contractions caused by Special Attention to Certain Members_\r\n\r\nSuppose a small boy of sensitive nature to enter a room suddenly, and to\r\nbe at once chided for his awkwardness. His body will probably stiffen,\r\nand his awkwardness become more pronounced. Now call his attention to\r\nhis hands and tell him he is holding them badly. His arms and hands will\r\nimmediately become painfully stiff. Speak of his feet and his legs come\r\non tension. Whatever member his attention is turned to, the muscles of\r\nthat part contract involuntarily.\r\n\r\nPhotographers sometimes have to contend with this form of involuntary\r\naction on the part of their sitters. When the hands are to be posed the\r\narms stiffen; so also do the legs, the shoulders, and the neck, each\r\nwhen its turn comes to receive attention.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions this form of awkwardness is easily overcome.\r\nSitting for a photograph soon becomes a simple matter. The boy outgrows\r\nthe awkward stage and gradually acquires a natural and easy bearing.\r\nMuscular stiffening due to attention to special members is usually the\r\nresult of an uncomfortable feeling of being out of one's element, and\r\nill at ease in one's surroundings. So soon as this feeling wears off the\r\ntendency to this form of stiffness disappears.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Contractions of Muscles due to the Radiation of Nerve Impulse_\r\n\r\nA voluntary exertion of some of the muscles of a member sometimes causes\r\nthe involuntary contraction of all the other muscles of the part. As\r\nwill readily be seen, the exercise then takes place under conditions of\r\nmuscular stiffness. This is commonly a feature of the unskilful and\r\nunaccustomed performance of muscular activities. A few examples will\r\nserve to illustrate this type of involuntary contraction better than a\r\nlengthy discussion of the physio-psychological principles involved.\r\n\r\nWhen a novice takes his first lesson in riding a bicycle he clutches the\r\nhandle bars in a vise-like grip. His knees are so stiff as to bend only\r\nwith a great exertion of strength. To steer the wheel the learner must\r\nput forth his most powerful muscular efforts. A half-hour lesson in\r\nbicycle riding often tires the beginner more than an afternoon's ride\r\ndoes the experienced cyclist.\r\n\r\nThis condition of muscular stiffness is due to the contraction of\r\nantagonist groups of muscles, involving practically the entire body. In\r\none sense the excessive muscular contractions are involuntary; yet it\r\nwould not be easy to define where the voluntary element of the\r\ncontractions leaves off.\r\n\r\nA similar excessive expenditure of strength may be seen in the attempt\r\nof an illiterate laborer to sign his name. He grips the pen as though it\r\nwere a crowbar, and puts forth enough strength to handle a twenty-pound\r\nweight. Learning to dance, or to skate, or to row a boat, is usually\r\naccompanied in the beginning by this form of muscular stiffness.\r\n\r\nAs skill is acquired by practice in the performance of complex\r\nactivities, the undue muscular tension of the initial stage is gradually\r\nrelaxed.\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which the radiation of nerve impulse may be\r\ncaused, entirely distinct from the lack of use or skill. Muscular\r\nstiffness may be induced in the case of activities so thoroughly\r\nhabitual as to be normally performed automatically. The cause of\r\nmuscular stiffness now to be considered is the attempt to perform\r\ncomplex activities mechanically, that is, by consciously directing the\r\nindividual component movements and muscular contractions involved in the\r\nactions. Involuntary contractions of associated and antagonist muscles\r\ntake place under these conditions, in addition to the voluntary exercise\r\nof the muscles normally exerted in the movements.\r\n\r\nThis fact may be illustrated by attempting to write a few lines, and\r\nforming every stroke of each letter by a distinct exercise of the will.\r\nIf you keep up this attempt for ten minutes you will find that you press\r\nupon the paper with many times your accustomed weight. The hand stiffens\r\nin consequence of the close attention paid to its movements. This\r\nstiffness will extend to the arm, and even to the shoulder, if the\r\nexercise be continued long enough and with sufficient intensity of\r\nattention to the hand.\r\n\r\nAnother good illustration of this form of muscular stiffening may be\r\nfound by walking upstairs, and paying the same kind of attention to the\r\nmuscular actions. Try to ascend a single flight of stairs, performing\r\neach elementary movement by a distinct volitional impulse. Pause on the\r\nfirst step to secure perfect balance on one foot; raise the other foot,\r\nbending the leg at the knee, then place this foot carefully on the next\r\nhigher step. Now gradually shift the weight of the body from the lower\r\nto the higher foot; as the body inclines forward, exert the muscles of\r\nthe back and sides to preserve your balance; then contract the leg\r\nmuscles so as to raise the body to the higher step, with the weight\r\nsupported on that foot. Repeat this operation for each step. To mount\r\none flight of stairs in this way will tire you more than ascending a\r\nhalf dozen flights in the ordinary automatic way.\r\n\r\nAll four of the types of involuntary muscular contraction just described\r\nmay be combined in a single instance. An inexperienced violin soloist,\r\nsuch as a student playing at a conservatory recital, often exemplifies\r\nthis. Nervousness and awkwardness cause him to tremble; the scratchy\r\nsound of his tones makes him twitch and start; meanwhile, the close\r\nattention paid to his fingering and bowing stiffens his arms and\r\ncompletes his difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe vocal organs are peculiarly subject to the forms of involuntary\r\nmuscular contraction under consideration. Each of the causes of muscular\r\ntension may exert its special influence on the voice. Let us go over the\r\nground once more, this time with special reference to the actions of the\r\nthroat muscles.\r\n\r\n_(a) Reflex Actions of the Muscles of the Vocal Organs, Independent of\r\nDirect Sensory Excitation_\r\n\r\nInvoluntary actions of the vocal organs normally occur in response to\r\nstimuli furnished by the emotions and feelings. Every one is familiar\r\nwith the shout of triumph, the sigh of relief, and the ejaculation of\r\nsurprise. Some emotions cause a convulsive stiffening of the muscles of\r\nthe vocal organs so complete as to render tone-production for a time\r\nabsolutely impossible. \"Speechless with terror,\" \"breathless with\r\napprehension,\" are expressions which accurately describe psychological\r\nprocesses. A crowd of people watching a difficult rescue of a drowning\r\nman is silent so long as the uncertainty lasts. A shout instantly goes\r\nup when the rescue is seen to be safely effected. Both the silence of\r\nthe nervous strain and the shout of relief are normal involuntary\r\nresponses to the emotional states.\r\n\r\n_(b) The Influence of Nervousness on the Vocal Action_\r\n\r\nNervous conditions exert a striking influence on the operations of the\r\nvoice. Even when our self-control under trying conditions is complete in\r\nall other respects we are often unable to prevent our voices betraying\r\nour nervous state. Stage fright, an extreme form of nervousness,\r\nsometimes deprives the sufferer entirely of the power of speech. This\r\ntemporary loss of vocal command is not due to an inability to innervate\r\nthe muscles of the vocal organs; on the contrary, it is caused by\r\nextreme muscular stiffness due to the violent, though involuntary,\r\ncontraction of all the muscles of the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions, entirely aside from nervousness, the voice\r\ninstinctively reflects every phase of sentiment and emotion. Love and\r\nhate, sorrow and joy, anger, fear, and rage, each is clearly expressed\r\nby the quality of the tones, independent of the meaning of the spoken\r\nwords. All these fine shades of tone quality result from muscular\r\nadjustments of the vocal mechanism. In some mysterious manner the\r\noutflow of motor impulses to the throat muscles is governed by the\r\nnervous and emotional states.\r\n\r\nThis form of muscular contraction is in one sense not involuntary. As\r\nthe voice is voluntarily used, all the muscular contractions involved\r\nare voluntary. Yet the minute contractions producing tone qualities\r\nexpressive of emotion are distinctly involuntary. More than this, these\r\ncontractions cannot usually be inhibited. An angry man cannot make his\r\nvoice sound other than angry. Our voices often betray our feelings in\r\nspite of the most earnest efforts at concealment.\r\n\r\nWhile the voice always normally and involuntarily adopts the tone\r\nquality indicative of the emotional state, this action of the vocal\r\norgans may be voluntarily and purposely performed. A perfect command of\r\nthese fine shades of tone quality renders the voice a very potent\r\ninstrument of expression. For the purposes of dramatic singing this form\r\nof vocal expression might be of great value. It is to be regretted that\r\ndramatic singers of this day pay so little attention to purely tonal\r\nexpressiveness. This is probably due in great measure to the prevalence\r\nof throat stiffness, which robs the voice of much of its expressive\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_(c) Contractions of the Throat Muscles, caused by Attention to the\r\nThroat_\r\n\r\nWhen a physician attempts to examine a child's throat, the tendency of\r\nthe throat muscles to this form of involuntary contractions is apt to be\r\nevidenced. The jaw stiffens and the tongue rises; for a time the\r\nrebellious little throat refuses to remain quiet and relaxed.\r\n\r\nPeople usually have some such difficulty the first time they submit to\r\nexamination with the laryngoscope. This is very apt to occur, even in\r\nthe case of experienced singers. Needless to say, this form of muscular\r\ncontraction is entirely involuntary; it even defies the most earnest\r\nattempts at prevention. Comparatively little experience is required for\r\nnormal people to overcome this tendency. The throat usually becomes\r\ntractable after one or two trials with the laryngoscope.\r\n\r\nVocalists are well aware of the proneness of one part of the vocal\r\nmechanism, the tongue, to stiffen in consequence of direct attention\r\nbeing paid to this member. In this connection Frangçon-Davies remarks:\r\n\"When the writer in early student days concentrated his attention upon\r\nhis tongue he found that this member became very stiff and unruly\r\nindeed.\" (_The Singing of the Future_, London, 1906.) Leo Kofler speaks\r\nof the same tendency: \"Tell a pupil to let his tongue lie flat in his\r\nmouth; he draws it back till it dams up his throat.\" (_Werner's\r\nMagazine_, Oct., 1899.)\r\n\r\n_(d) Throat Stiffness due to the Radiation of Nerve Impulse_\r\n\r\nTwo types of muscular tension due to the radiation of motor impulses\r\nwere noted; first, the stiffness incident to the early stages of\r\npractice in complex activities; second, the stiffness caused by the\r\nattempt to perform complex activities in a mechanical manner by paying\r\nattention to the individual component movements and contractions. To\r\nboth these types of muscular stiffness the voice is especially subject.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to find a perfect illustration of throat stiffness\r\nincident to the early stages of instruction in singing. For this the\r\nchief reason is that the later form of stiffness, due to the attempt\r\ndirectly to manage the vocal organs, is much more pronounced than the\r\ntemporary early tension. As good an example as possible would be the\r\nfollowing: Let some one possessed of a fine natural untrained voice sing\r\na steady tone and then attempt to trill on the same note. The attempted\r\ntrill will invariably indicate a much higher degree of stiffness than\r\nthe single tone.\r\n\r\nSeveral investigators of the voice have noticed the tendency of the\r\nthroat to stiffen when the singer tries to manage the voice by paying\r\ndirect attention to the mechanical action. Clara Kathleen Rogers points\r\nthis out clearly in the following passage: \"There exists a possible and\r\na dangerous obstacle to the performance of the natural mission of the\r\nvoice. That obstacle is what? It is a superfluous and misdirected mental\r\nactivity which is fruitful of a corresponding obstruction on the part of\r\nthe body. In the body this obstruction takes the form of superfluous or\r\nunnatural tension.\" (_The Philosophy of Singing_, N. Y., 1893.) Prof.\r\nScripture describes in scientific language the results of any attempt\r\ndirectly to manage the vocal organs. Speaking of the use of the voice\r\nunder unfavorable conditions, he says: \"The attempt is instinctively\r\nmade by the speaker or singer to correct such a fault by voluntary\r\ninnervation of the muscles; this cannot succeed perfectly because an\r\nincrease of innervation brings about contractions of associated and\r\nantagonist muscles with the result of changed conditions and changed\r\nsounds. Such extra muscular effort is, moreover, very fatiguing.\" (_The\r\nElements of Experimental Phonetics_, 1902.)\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of scientific voice culture this is one of the most\r\nimportant facts which have been determined. The attempt to manage the\r\nvoice, by paying attention to the mechanical operations of the vocal\r\norgans, causes an involuntary contraction of all the throat muscles, and\r\nso interferes with the normal instinctive vocal action. Even the mere\r\nthinking of the throat in singing, and especially in practising, is\r\nenough to induce throat stiffness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHROAT STIFFNESS AND INCORRECT SINGING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a lamentable fact that most of the singing heard nowadays gives\r\nevidence of throat stiffness. Perfect singing becomes more rare with\r\neach succeeding year. The younger generation of artists in particular\r\nevince a marked tendency to this fault of production.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a cause of faulty tone-production in singing, throat\r\nstiffness is due to only one influence, viz., the attempt to manage the\r\nvoice by thinking of the vocal organs and their mechanical operations.\r\nMuscular tension due to nervousness, or to the unskilful nature of first\r\nattempts at singing, cannot be looked upon as causing a wrong vocal\r\naction. In the case of nervousness the lack of vocal command faithfully\r\nreflects the psychological condition of the singer; the imperfect\r\nresponse of the voice is normal to this condition. The stiffness due to\r\nfirst attempts is also perfectly normal. Moreover, both these forms of\r\nthroat stiffness are temporary; they disappear when the cause,\r\nnervousness or lack of skill, is removed.\r\n\r\nThroat stiffness does not necessarily destroy the musical character of\r\nthe voice. Very many degrees and varieties of excessive throat tension\r\nare possible. The undue muscular exertion may be so slight in degree\r\nthat the throat stiffness can be detected in the sound of the tones only\r\nby a highly sensitive and observant hearer. Or on the other hand, the\r\nmuscles of the entire throat may be so powerfully contracted that the\r\nsinger has only a very imperfect command of the voice. Between the two\r\nextremes, perfect tone-production and exaggerated stiffness, every\r\nconceivable shade of difference in degree of undue tension might be\r\nillustrated in the case of some prominent singer.\r\n\r\nFaulty tone-production manifests itself in two ways; first, in its\r\neffects on the tones of the voice; second, in its effects on the\r\nsinger's throat. Let us consider each of these topics separately.\r\n\r\n_The Effect of Throat Stiffness on the Sound of the Voice_\r\n\r\nIn whatever degree throat stiffness is present, to just that extent the\r\nvoice sacrifices something of its capabilities as a musical instrument.\r\nThe voice can realize its full natural resources of beauty, range,\r\npower, and flexibility only when the throat is absolutely free from\r\nundue tension. As regards the quality of the tones, every phase of undue\r\nthroat tension has its effect on the sound of the voice. These effects\r\nare always bad; the same voice is less beautiful when used in a\r\nstiffened condition than when perfectly produced. Throaty and nasal\r\ntones are always more or less harsh and offensive to the sensitive\r\nhearer. Further, the more pronounced the state of throat stiffness the\r\nmore marked does the throaty or nasal quality become.\r\n\r\nUnder conditions of throat tension the range of the voice is almost\r\nalways curtailed. The highest and lowest notes possible to any voice can\r\nbe reached only when the throat is entirely free from stiffness. So also\r\nwith regard to the varying degrees of power, undue tension prevents the\r\nsinger from obtaining the extreme effects. A throaty singer's soft tones\r\ngenerally lack the carrying quality. Louder tones can be produced with a\r\nnormally relaxed than with a stiffened throat.\r\n\r\nReal flexibility of voice is impossible to a stiff-throated singer.\r\nExtreme rapidity and accuracy of muscular adjustments, the physical\r\nbasis of coloratura singing, cannot be attained when the muscles are\r\nhampered by undue tension.\r\n\r\nA distinct fault of production, the tremolo, is directly due to throat\r\nstiffness. A simple experiment illustrates the nature of the muscular\r\naction from which the tremolo results. \"Set\" the muscles of the arm by\r\ncontracting the biceps and triceps with the utmost possible strength.\r\nWith the arm in this stiffened condition flex and extend the forearm\r\nslowly several times. You will notice a pronounced trembling of the arm.\r\nWhy a condition of muscular stiffness should cause the affected member\r\nto tremble is not well understood. But the fact admits of no question.\r\nIt is highly probable that the tremolo is caused by a trembling of the\r\nvocal organs, due to muscular stiffness. The tones of a voice afflicted\r\nwith tremolo always give evidence of extreme throat tension.\r\n\r\nAnother bad result of throat stiffness in tone-production is seen in the\r\nmatter of intonation. Tones produced with a stiff throat are seldom in\r\nperfect tune. This subject will be more fully treated in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Effects of Muscular Stiffness on the Throat_\r\n\r\nMany of the muscles of the vocal organs, particularly the laryngeal\r\nmuscles, are extremely small and delicate. Under normal conditions these\r\nmuscles are fully capable of exerting the relatively small amount of\r\nstrength required of them without strain or injury. But when the voice\r\nis used in a stiffened condition the delicate muscles of the larynx are\r\nobliged to contract with much more than their normal strength. To borrow\r\nan expression of the engineers, the throat muscles are then forced to\r\ncarry an excessive load.\r\n\r\nA balanced contraction of antagonist groups of muscles is the muscular\r\nbasis of throat stiffness. When the voice is used in this condition each\r\nmuscle of the vocal organs must put forth the amount of effort necessary\r\nto produce the desired effect under normal conditions, in addition to an\r\neffort equal to the counterbalancing pull of its antagonist muscle. An\r\nincrease in the degree of throat stiffness demands a corresponding\r\nincrease in the effort exerted by every muscle of the throat.\r\n\r\nOver-exertion of muscles always results in strain and injury. The extent\r\nof the injury to the muscular tissues varies with the degree of\r\nexcessive exertion and with the duration of the injurious exercise. An\r\nadvanced stage of muscular strain is distinctly a pathological\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nTone-production in a state of throat stiffness is of necessity injurious\r\nto the muscles of the vocal organs. The delicate laryngeal muscles are\r\nspecially subject to the injurious effects of strain. These effects vary\r\nin extent and character, according to the degree of throat stiffness, to\r\nthe extent and duration of the faulty use of the voice, and to the\r\nindividual characteristics of the singer. A very slight degree of undue\r\ntension may not sensibly injure the voice. Even a fairly marked\r\ncondition of tension, such as is evidenced by the uniformly throaty\r\nquality of many baritones and mezzo-sopranos, may be persisted in for\r\nyears without perceptibly straining the throat or destroying the musical\r\nvalue of the voice. But a misuse of the voice is bound, in the course of\r\ntime, to show its injurious results on the throat. How many promising\r\nyoung singers are forced to abandon their careers in early life, at the\r\ntime when their artistic and dramatic powers are just ripening to\r\nfruition! A misused voice \"wears out\" years before its time.\r\n\r\nMost of the throat troubles of singers are directly caused by throat\r\nstiffness and muscular strain. Dr. Mills, among others, touches on this\r\nfact. \"All the author's experience as a laryngologist tended to convince\r\nhim that most of those evils from which speakers and singers suffer,\r\nwhatever the part of the vocal mechanism affected, arise from faulty\r\nmethods of voice production, or excess in the use of methods in\r\nthemselves correct.\" (_Voice Production in Singing and Speaking_,\r\nPhila., 1906.)\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of artistic singing, a voice loses all its value when\r\nthe injurious effects of throat stiffness become very pronounced. On\r\nthis account singers are obliged to give up appearing in public before\r\nthe condition reaches the extreme. It follows therefore that only in the\r\ncase of public speakers do we see the extreme results of persistence in\r\nthe wrong use of the voice. \"Clergyman's sore throat\" is the name\r\nusually applied to this condition. The sustained use of the voice, under\r\nconditions of extreme strain, is exceedingly painful both to the speaker\r\nand to the hearer.\r\n\r\nSingers are usually unconscious of throat stiffness unless the condition\r\nbe very pronounced. Neither the sense of hearing nor the muscular sense\r\ninforms the singer of the state of tension. Accustomed to the sound of\r\nhis own voice, the singer may be unaware of a throaty or nasal quality\r\nwhich he would instantly detect in another voice. This is also true of\r\nthe muscular sensations of tone-production; habit makes the singer\r\ninattentive to the sensations caused by throat tension.\r\n\r\nThroat stiffness always tends to become greater in degree; it is a\r\nself-aggravating condition. Even though very slight in its beginnings,\r\nthe state of stiffness obliges the singer to put forth more than the\r\nnormal effort in order to secure the desired effects. This increase of\r\ninnervation is not confined to the muscles which need to be more\r\nstrongly contracted. As Prof. Scripture points out, it also extends to\r\nthe associated and antagonist muscles, that is, to all the muscles of\r\nthe throat. Thus the stiffness is increased in degree. Still greater\r\nexertion is then required, resulting in still greater stiffness. This\r\nmay go on for years, the voice gradually becoming less responsive to the\r\ndemands of the singer.\r\n\r\nIndividual personal characteristics are an important factor in\r\ndetermining a singer's experience with throat stiffness. Some singers\r\nare so fortunately constituted as to be almost entirely free from the\r\ntendency to stiffen the throat. Others detect the tendency in its\r\nbeginning and find no difficulty in correcting it. Still others\r\nhabituate themselves to some manner of tone-production, and neither\r\nincrease nor diminish the degree of stiffness. Even under modern methods\r\nof instruction, many artists are correctly trained from the start and so\r\nnever stiffen their throats in any way.\r\n\r\nSeveral traits of character are concerned in determining the individual\r\ntendency to throat stiffness. Nervous temperament, keenness of ear,\r\nartistic and musical endowment, each has its influence in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nThe great prevalence of throat stiffness among present-day singers is\r\ndue primarily to the idea of mechanical vocal management as the basis\r\nof instruction in singing. Not only are modern methods intrinsically\r\nworthless, in that a correct use of the voice cannot be attained by the\r\napplication of mechanical rules. Worse than this, the means used for\r\ntraining the voice are such as to defeat their own purpose. At every\r\ninstant of instruction the student's attention is expressly turned to\r\nthe vocal organs and to the mechanical operations of the voice. The only\r\npossible result of this kind of vocal instruction is to stiffen the\r\nthroat and so to render the correct vocal action an impossibility.\r\n\r\nA peculiar contradiction is presented by the modern vocal teacher; his\r\nartistic conception of singing is utterly at variance with his ideas of\r\nmechanical tone-production. It may safely be said that the vast majority\r\nof vocal teachers are thoroughly conversant with the highest standards\r\nof artistic singing. They know what effects their pupils ought to\r\nobtain. But the means they use for enabling the pupils to get these\r\neffects have exactly the contrary result. When the student tries to open\r\nthe throat this obstinate organ only closes the tighter. Attempting to\r\ncorrect a tremolo by \"holding the throat steady\" causes the throat to\r\ntremble all the more.\r\n\r\nModern voice culture, in its practical aspect, is a struggle with throat\r\nstiffness. Everything the student does, for the purpose of acquiring\r\ndirect command of the voice, has some influence in causing the throat to\r\nstiffen. Telling the student to hold the throat relaxed seldom effects a\r\ncure; this direction includes a primary cause of tension,--the turning\r\nof attention to the throat. All the teacher can do to counteract the\r\nstiffening influence is to give relaxing exercises. These are in most\r\ncases efficacious so long as constructive instruction is abandoned, and\r\nthe relaxing of the throat is made the sole purpose of study. But soon\r\nafter positive instruction is resumed the tendency to stiffen reappears.\r\nAs lesson follows after lesson, the stiffness becomes gradually,\r\nimperceptibly more pronounced. At length the time again comes for\r\nrelaxing exercises.\r\n\r\nA single repetition of this process, relaxing the throat and then\r\nstiffening it again, may extend over several months of study. During\r\nthis time the student naturally learns a great deal about music and the\r\nartistic side of singing, and also improves the keenness of the sense\r\nof hearing. This artistic development is necessarily reflected in the\r\nvoice so soon as the throat is again relaxed.\r\n\r\nIt usually happens that students change teachers about the time the\r\nvoice has become unmanageably stiff. In this condition the student, of\r\ncourse, sings rather badly. A marked improvement in the singing\r\ngenerally results from the change of teachers. This is easy to\r\nunderstand because the new teacher devotes his first efforts to relaxing\r\nthe stiffened throat. Later on this improvement is very likely to be\r\nlost, for the second teacher has nothing more of a positive nature to\r\noffer than the first.\r\n\r\nVocal teachers in general seem to be aware of the fact that mechanical\r\ninstruction causes the student's throat to stiffen. A much-debated\r\nquestion is whether \"local effort\" is needed to bring about the correct\r\nvocal action. The term local effort is used to describe the direct\r\ninnervation of the throat muscles. A logical application of the\r\nmechanical idea absolutely demands the use of local effort. This is the\r\nmain argument of the local-effort teachers.\r\n\r\nThose teachers who discountenance local effort have only their own\r\nexperience to guide them. They simply know that local effort results in\r\nthroat stiffness. Yet these teachers have nothing to offer in place of\r\nthe mechanical management of the vocal organs. Even though aware of the\r\nevil results of local effort, they yet know of no other means of\r\nimparting the correct vocal action. The weakness of the position of\r\nthese teachers is well summed up by a writer in _Werner's Magazine_ for\r\nJune, 1899: \"To teach without local effort or local thought is to teach\r\nin the dark. Every exponent of the non-local-effort theory contradicts\r\nhis theory every time he tells of it.\" To that extent this writer states\r\nthe case correctly. Every modern vocal teacher believes that the voice\r\nmust be consciously guided in its muscular operations. Until this\r\nerroneous belief is abandoned it is idle for a teacher to decry the use\r\nof local effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE MEANING OF VOCAL TRAINING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all scientific treatises on the voice it is assumed that the voice\r\nhas some specifically correct mode of operation. Training the voice is\r\nsupposed to involve the leading of the vocal organs to abandon their\r\nnatural and instinctive manner of operating, and to adopt some other\r\nform of activity. Further, the assumption is made that the student of\r\nsinging must cause the vocal organs to adopt a supposedly correct manner\r\nof operating by paying direct attention to the mechanical movements of\r\ntone-production. Both these assumptions are utterly mistaken. On\r\nscientific analysis no difference is seen between the right and the\r\nwrong vocal action, such as is assumed in the accepted Vocal Science.\r\nPsychological principles do not countenance the idea of mechanical vocal\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nYet the fact remains, as a matter of empirical observation, that there\r\nis a marked difference between the natural voice and the correctly\r\ntrained voice. What change takes place in the voice as a result of\r\ncorrect training?\r\n\r\nSinging is a natural function of the vocal organs. Learning to sing\r\nartistically does not involve a departure from natural and instinctive\r\nprocesses. The training of the voice consists of the acquirement of\r\nskill in the use of the vocal organs, and of nothing more.\r\n\r\nUnder normal conditions the vocal organs instinctively adjust\r\nthemselves, by performing the necessary muscular contractions, to\r\nfulfill the demands of the ear. In order that a perfect musical tone be\r\nproduced it is necessary in the first place that the ear be keen and\r\nwell trained; only such an ear can know the exact sound of a perfect\r\ntone, and so demand it of the voice. Second, the vocal organs must make\r\nrepeated efforts to produce the perfect tone, each response approaching\r\nnearer to the mentally-conceived tone. Two elements are therefore\r\ninvolved in the training of the voice; first, the cultivation of the\r\nsense of hearing; second, the acquirement of skill in the use of the\r\nvoice by the actual practice of singing.\r\n\r\nPractical vocal teachers generally recognize the importance of both\r\nthese elements of Voice Culture. Only in one way do they fall short of\r\nfully realizing the value of ear training and of practice guided by the\r\near;--they do not see that these two topics sum up the whole material of\r\nvocal training. Unfortunately, the search after some imaginary means of\r\ndirect vocal management destroys, in all modern methods, most of the\r\nvalue of the real elements of voice culture.\r\n\r\nA few citations from standard writers on the voice will show the\r\nestimation in which ear-training is held. To begin with, the old Italian\r\nmasters were fully alive to the necessity of cultivating the sense of\r\nhearing, as witness Tosi: \"One who has not a good ear should not\r\nundertake either to instruct or to sing.\" This writer also says in the\r\nchapter headed \"Observations for a student\": \"Let him hear as much as he\r\ncan the most celebrated singers, and likewise the most excellent\r\ninstrumental performers; because from the attention in hearing them one\r\nreaps more advantage than from any instruction whatsoever.\"\r\n\r\nAnother early writer on the voice, the celebrated Adolph Bernhard Marx,\r\nspeaks of the advantage derived from the attentive listening to voices:\r\n\"An important influence is exerted by the frequent attentive hearing of\r\ngood voices. Through this an idea of good tone is strengthened, which\r\ngains an influence on the use and also on the training of the organs,\r\nnot perhaps immediate, but clearly seen in its results.\" (_Die Kunst des\r\nGesanges_, Berlin, 1826.)\r\n\r\nAmong modern writers only a few need be mentioned. D. Frangçon-Davies\r\nremarks: \"The training of the ear is one half of the training of the\r\nvoice.\" (_The Singing of the Future._) Clara Kathleen Rogers is even\r\nmore emphatic in her statement: \"Not to exercise our sense of hearing is\r\nto rob it gradually of the habit of acting at all; whereas, if we keep\r\nit in exercise, it will daily grow readier, finer, more acute, more\r\nanalytical, and the ear will serve as an ever more effective medium of\r\nreaction on the will.\" The following remark of the same writer points\r\nunmistakably to an understanding of the evil results of the attempt to\r\nsing mechanically: \"If the singer's attention is directed to any part of\r\nthe vocal instrument, or even to its motor, the breath, his sense of\r\nsound, and his perception of either the beautiful or the bad elements\r\nin sound, will grow fainter and fainter.\" (_The Physiology of Singing._)\r\n\r\nAs for the purpose of cultivating the sense of hearing, this is also\r\npointed out by several prominent vocal theorists. One of the latest\r\nexponents of the traditional method of instruction was Stéphen de la\r\nMadelaine, who remarks: \"The first need of the voice is to be guided in\r\nits exercise by an ear capable of appreciating naturally its least\r\ndeviation.\" (_Théorie complète du Chant_, Paris, 1852.)\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent authoritative writers on voice culture, Dr.\r\nMills, speaks at length of the necessity of guiding the voice by the\r\nsense of hearing. \"We cannot too much insist on both speaker and singer\r\nattending to forming a connection between his ear and his mouth cavity.\r\nHe is to hear that he may produce good tones, and the tones cannot be\r\ncorrectly formed if they be not well observed. To listen to one's self\r\ncarefully and constantly is a most valuable but little practised art.\r\nThe student should listen as an inexorable critic, accepting only the\r\nbest from himself.\" Dr. Mills touches on the psychological features of\r\nthe connection between voice and ear. \"There can be no doubt that the\r\nnervous impulses that pass from the ear to the brain are of all sensory\r\nmessages the most important guides for the outgoing ones that determine\r\nthe necessary movements.\" Summing up the matter of ear-training and\r\nvocal guidance Dr. Mills says: \"The author would impress on all students\r\nof music, and of the voice as used in both singing and speaking, the\r\nparamount importance of learning early to listen most attentively to\r\nothers when executing music; and above all to listen with the greatest\r\ncare to themselves, and never to accept any musical tone that does not\r\nfully satisfy the ear.\" (_Voice Production in Singing and Speaking_,\r\n1906.)\r\n\r\nOne more citation from Mrs. Rogers must suffice. \"And now, in\r\nconclusion, let me once more remind the singer that in practising these\r\nand all other vocal exercises the ear is the only safe guide.\"\r\n\r\nGiven a fine natural voice and a trained musical ear, skill is acquired\r\nin the use of the voice by the repetition of effort. The only necessity\r\nis for the singer to have a clear mental conception of the effects to\r\nbe obtained, and to listen attentively to the voice. With each\r\nrepetition of an exercise, whether on sustained tones, scale passages,\r\ncrescendo and diminuendo, or whatever else, the voice responds more\r\nsmoothly and accurately to the mental demand. Each time the student\r\npractises the exercise he listens to the tones and notes how they differ\r\nfrom the desired effect; he strives the next time to correct this\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nPsychological principles verify the proverb that practice makes perfect.\r\nThis is true of all complex activities. Through repeated performance the\r\nmuscles, or rather the motor-nerve centers, become habituated to complex\r\nactivities. Coördinations gradually become perfect and automatic because\r\nthe nerve impulses naturally tend to take the well-worn paths. To this\r\nrule the voice is no exception. Practice makes perfect, with the voice,\r\nas with every other muscular activity.\r\n\r\nIn practical Voice Culture the ear and the voice are normally trained\r\ntogether. The proper function of the teacher is to guide the student in\r\ndeveloping along the two lines. Listening to his own voice is a valuable\r\nmeans for the student to develop his sense of hearing. It is for the\r\nmaster to point out the salient qualities and faults in the pupil's\r\ntones in order that the pupil may know what to listen for. As the ear\r\ngradually becomes keener and better acquainted with the characteristics\r\nof perfect singing, it also becomes more exacting in its demands on the\r\nvoice. In its turn the voice steadily improves in its responsiveness to\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\nSkill in using the voice involves something more than has thus far been\r\nconsidered under the head of tone-production. Skill in singing is\r\nsynonymous with finished vocal technique, and the basis of technique is\r\nthe correctly produced single tone. It is seen that a single tone can be\r\nsung correctly when, first, the singer knows the sound of the perfect\r\nmusical tone, and second, the vocal organs are not hampered by muscular\r\nstiffness. When these conditions are fulfilled nothing but practice is\r\nneeded for the acquirement of technical skill.\r\n\r\nColoratura singing presents the highest development of vocal technique.\r\nDazzling as the effects of coloratura are, they are obtained by the\r\ncombination of a few simple elements. Perfect command of the single tone\r\nthroughout the entire compass of the voice, with accurately graded\r\ncrescendo and diminuendo, the clear, rapid, and accurate transition from\r\none note to another in the varying degrees of staccato and\r\nlegato,--these elements include the whole physical material of vocal\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\nTraining the voice is one concrete process. Its component features may\r\nbe considered separately; the cultivation of the sense of hearing, the\r\nacquirement of command of the single tone, and the development of\r\ntechnical skill,--each may be considered apart from its companion\r\nprocesses. But in actual practice the three elements of Voice Culture\r\ncannot be dissociated. The student of singing progresses simultaneously\r\nalong all three lines. Intelligently directed practice in singing\r\nresults in this simultaneous progress. As the voice depends for guidance\r\non the ear, so the ear benefits by the improvement of the voice. Each\r\nadvance made by the voice toward the perfect production of tone is\r\nmarked by a greater facility in the technical use of the voice. Correct\r\ntone-production cannot be directly acquired by the singing of single\r\ntones. This practice would tend to stiffen the throat. Technique and\r\ntone-production must be developed together.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between the natural and the properly trained\r\nvoice. As to the nature of this difference the facts of empirical\r\nobservation are borne out by the results of scientific analysis. The\r\nnatural voice is crude because it is unskilfully used. A lack of\r\nfacility is revealed in the untrained singer's handling of the voice.\r\nIntonations are imperfect; transitions from note to note are rough; the\r\nwhole effect indicates that the voice is not completely under the\r\ncommand of the singer. Further, the sound of the individual tones\r\nbetrays faults of production. The tones are more or less throaty or\r\nnasal, or indicative of some degree of muscular tension.\r\n\r\nA perfectly used voice, on the other hand, convinces the hearer that the\r\nsinger has full command of all the resources of the vocal organs. Each\r\ntone is a perfect musical sound, free from fault or blemish. The voice\r\nmoves from one note to another with ease and with purity of intonation.\r\nAll the gradations of loud and soft, all the lights and shades of\r\nsentiment or passion, seem to respond directly to the singer's\r\ninstinctive desire for musical expression. On the physical side the\r\nsinger's voice is felt by the hearer to be in a condition of balanced\r\nand harmonious muscular activity.\r\n\r\nWhen the possessor of a good natural voice goes through a proper course\r\nof vocal training, the faults of production native to the untrained\r\nvoice are gradually corrected. Wrong muscular tension is imperceptibly\r\nrelaxed. Little by little the student acquires facility in handling the\r\nvoice. Coincident with this progress is the advance toward the correct\r\nvocal action. The transition from the natural to the perfect use of the\r\nvoice is gradual and imperceptible. There is no stage of progress at\r\nwhich the operations of the voice radically change in character. At no\r\ntime does the student change the manner of managing the voice. Effects\r\ndifficult at first gradually become easier, simply as the result of\r\npractice. This is the only change that the voice undergoes in training.\r\n\r\nOne influence, and only one, can interfere with this normal development\r\nof the voice. This is the involuntary and unconscious stiffening of the\r\nthroat. In the normal practice of singing nothing is involved which\r\ncould cause the throat to stiffen. True, the first stages of study are\r\nusually marked by a slight degree of stiffness, due solely to the lack\r\nof practice and experience. This initial stiffness does not tend to\r\nbecome habitual; it disappears before the student becomes aware of it,\r\nand leaves no permanent trace on the voice. That is, provided mechanical\r\ninstruction does not intervene, to introduce the tendency directly to\r\nstiffen the throat.\r\n\r\nAs the initial stiffness disappears, and the vocal action gradually\r\nbecomes smooth and automatic, the voice begins to take on the\r\ncharacteristics of perfect tone-production. The voice rounds out, the\r\ntones become free and true, and in perfect tune. No excessive throat\r\ntension being present, the voice conforms to the correct empirical\r\nstandard of tone-production. It gives evidence to the ear of correct\r\nsupport and of open throat. The tones issue freely from the mouth and\r\nconvey no impression of throat or nose.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of experience it is known that vocal students generally make\r\nsatisfactory progress in the first few months of study. This is\r\nperfectly natural. It requires several months for the normally\r\nconstituted student to grasp the idea of mechanical vocal management.\r\nGifted with a fine voice, the natural impulse of any one is to sing. By\r\nsinging naturally the voice is bound to improve.\r\n\r\nJust so soon as the student begins to understand the meaning of\r\nattempted mechanical guidance of the voice, the evil effects of throat\r\nstiffness begin to be manifest. The more earnest and intelligent\r\nstudents are often the worst sufferers from throat stiffness. They more\r\nreadily grasp the mechanical doctrines of modern methods and apply the\r\nmechanical idea more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThere is in reality no problem of tone-production such as the accepted\r\ntheory of Voice Culture propounds. The voice does not require to be\r\ntaught how to act. Tone-production was never thought to involve any\r\nmechanical problem until the attention of vocalists was turned to the\r\nmechanical operations of the voice. This dates, roughly speaking, from\r\nabout 1800. Since that time the whole tendency of Voice Culture has been\r\nmechanical. Nowadays the entire musical world is acquainted with the\r\nidea that the voice must be directly guided; hardly any one has ever\r\nheard this belief contradicted. To say that the voice needs no guidance\r\nother than the ear would seem utterly preposterous to the average lover\r\nof singing. It is even highly probable that this statement would not be\r\nunderstood. Yet there is strong evidence that the old Italian masters\r\nwould have had equal difficulty in grasping the idea of mechanical vocal\r\nmanagement. How long it will take for the vocal profession to be\r\npersuaded of the error of the mechanical idea only the future can\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important fact about vocal training is the following:\r\nThe voice is benefited by producing beautiful tones, and is injured by\r\nproducing harsh sounds. A tone of perfect beauty can be sung only when\r\nthe vocal organs are free from unnecessary tension. The nearer the tones\r\napproach to the perfection of beauty, the closer does the voice come to\r\nthe correct action. Healthy exercise of the voice, with the throat free\r\nfrom strain, strengthens and develops the throat muscles. Harsh and\r\nunmusical sounds, produced by the voice, indicate that the throat is in\r\na condition of injurious tension. Singing under these circumstances\r\nstrains and weakens the muscles of the throat and injures the voice.\r\nThe harsher the tones the worse they are for the voice.\r\n\r\nBeauty of tone is the only criterion of the correct vocal action. By\r\nlistening to himself the singer may know whether his tone-production is\r\ncorrect. If the tones are beautiful the tone-production cannot be wrong.\r\nThe ear must always decide. A normally constituted ear instinctively\r\ndelights in hearing beautiful sounds. While attentive listening renders\r\nthe ear more keen and discriminating, no vocal student of average gifts\r\nneed be told the meaning of tonal beauty.\r\n\r\nInstinct prompts the possessor of a fine natural voice and a musical ear\r\nto sing, and to sing beautiful tones. No normally constituted student\r\ncan take pleasure in the practice of mechanical exercises. This form of\r\nstudy is repugnant to the musical sensibility. Vocal students want to\r\nsing; they feel instinctively that the practice of mechanical exercises\r\nis not singing. A prominent exponent of mechanical instruction\r\ncomplains: \"I tell them to take breathing exercises three times a\r\nday--but they all want to go right to singing songs.\" (_Werner's\r\nMagazine_, April, 1899.) These students are perfectly right. They know\r\ninstinctively that the voice can be trained only by singing. There is no\r\nconnection between artistic singing and the practice of toneless\r\nbreathing exercises. \"Five finger drills\" and studies in broken scales\r\nof the types generally used are also utterly unmusical. Mechanical\r\ndrills, whether toneless or vocal, have little effect other than to\r\ninduce throat stiffness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIMITATION THE RATIONAL BASIS OF VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed by vocal theorists that the voice cannot be\r\ntrained by imitation. Browne and Behnke state this belief definitely:\r\n\"Singing cannot be learned exclusively by imitation.\" (_Voice, Song, and\r\nSpeech._) Having ascertained the futility of the attempt to teach\r\nsinging mechanically, it is now in order to determine the truth or\r\nfalsity of the statement that the exercise of the imitative faculty\r\nalone does not suffice for the training of the voice.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, no one has ever thought of questioning the existence\r\nof an instinct of vocal imitation. On the contrary, this instinct is\r\neverywhere recognized. In childhood we learn to speak our mother tongue\r\nby imitating the speech of those about us. \"Talking proper does not set\r\nin till the instinct to _imitate sounds_ ripens in the nervous system.\"\r\n(_The Principles of Psychology_, Wm. James, New York, 1890.)\r\n\r\nVocal imitation would be impossible without the ability of the voice to\r\nproduce sounds in obedience to the commands of the ear. This ability the\r\nvoice normally possesses; spoken language could not otherwise exist. The\r\nvoice can imitate a wide range of sounds. If the perfect vocal tone can\r\nbe shown to be included in this range of sounds, then the voice can be\r\ntrained by imitation.\r\n\r\nExceptional powers of vocal imitation are sometimes developed.\r\nVaudeville performers are by no means rare who can imitate the tones of\r\nthe oboe, the clarinet, the muted trumpet, and several other\r\ninstruments. Imitation of the notes and songs of birds is also a\r\nfamiliar type of performance. This peculiar gift of imitation results in\r\neach case from some special structure of the vocal organs. One performer\r\ncan imitate the reed instruments, another the lighter brasses, and so\r\non. Just what peculiar formation of the vocal organs is required for\r\nthis type of imitative ability need not be inquired here. All that need\r\nbe noted is, that the vocal organs must be so constructed as to be able\r\nto produce the particular quality of sound. Given this natural ability\r\non the part of the vocal organs, the power to produce the tone quality\r\nis developed by repeated attempts at imitation. The possessor of the\r\nnatural gift perfects this gift by practice. For practice in the\r\nimitation of sounds to be effective it is necessary that the ear be well\r\nacquainted with the tone quality to be reproduced. In addition, the\r\npractice must be guided by the performer listening closely to the sounds\r\nproduced by the vocal organs, and constantly comparing these sounds to\r\nthe tones of the instrument chosen for imitation.\r\n\r\nThis vocal imitation of instruments is not a normal ability; the tones\r\nof the oboe and trumpet do not lie within the range of qualities native\r\nto the normal voice. But the quality of the perfect vocal tone is\r\nunquestionably within the range of every voice so constituted as to be\r\ncapable of artistic singing. A fine natural voice normally produces\r\nbeautiful tones. It is only with this type of voice that Voice Culture\r\nis concerned. Such a voice must be capable of producing the perfect\r\nvocal tone. Can it learn to produce this quality of tone by imitation?\r\n\r\nIt cannot be questioned that the faulty tones of one voice can readily\r\nbe imitated by another voice. Any one endowed with normal powers of\r\nspeech can imitate a markedly nasal speaking voice. This is equally true\r\nof a nasal tone in singing, and of a strongly throaty tone as well. The\r\nmore marked the fault of production the more readily it is heard and the\r\nmore easily it can be imitated.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine the case of a vocal teacher who undertakes to teach a\r\ngifted pupil by having the pupil imitate tones of faulty production, and\r\ngradually correcting the faults in the tones sung as a model for the\r\npupil. The master is of course understood to have perfect command of his\r\nown voice. Suppose this master to begin the course of instruction by\r\nsinging for the pupil tones of exaggerated throaty quality, and bidding\r\nthe pupil to imitate these tones. Naturally, the pupil would have no\r\ndifficulty in doing so. At the next lesson the master would very\r\nslightly improve the quality of the tones sung as a model for the\r\npupil's imitation. The student would listen to these tones and model his\r\ndaily practice accordingly. Just so soon as the student had succeeded in\r\ncorrectly reproducing this slightly less throaty tone the master would\r\nagain set a slightly improved model.\r\n\r\nWith each successive step the master might eliminate, one by one, the\r\nfaults of his own tone-production. Following the same course, the pupil\r\nwould also gradually approach a correct model of tone. Finally, all the\r\nfaults of tone-production having been corrected, both of master and\r\npupil, the latter would be called upon to imitate perfect vocal tones.\r\nIt would necessarily follow either that the student would successfully\r\nimitate the master's perfect tones or that at some point in this\r\nprogress the student's imitative faculty would be found lacking.\r\n\r\nCould any point be located at which the student would be unable to\r\nimitate the teacher's voice? This could certainly not be in the early\r\nstages of the course. Any one can imitate a very bad throaty or nasal\r\ntone. This being done, the imitation of a slightly less faulty tone\r\nwould also present no difficulty. A second improvement in the master's\r\nmodel tone would again be readily imitated, and so on, with each\r\nsucceeding correction of the faults of production. When the last trace\r\nof faulty production in the student's voice had been eliminated, he\r\nwould be singing perfect tones. It is utterly impossible to define a\r\npoint in this progress at which the pupil would be unable to imitate the\r\nteacher's voice. If a bad fault of production can be imitated, so can a\r\ncomparatively slight fault. Further, if the pupil can correct his\r\npronounced faulty production by imitating a tone not quite so faulty, so\r\ncan he improve upon this tone by imitating a still better model of\r\nproduction. This process of gradual improvement by imitation must be\r\ncapable of continuation until the last fault is eliminated. No limit can\r\nbe set to the ability of the voice to improve its manner of\r\ntone-production by imitation. It must therefore be concluded that the\r\nperfect vocal action can be acquired by imitation.\r\n\r\nIn practical Voice Culture, learning to sing by imitation means simply\r\nthe cultivation of the sense of hearing and the guidance of the voice by\r\nthe ear. In other words, those vocal theorists who insist upon ear\r\ntraining commit themselves to the theory of imitative Voice Culture.\r\nWhat necessity is there of mechanical management of the vocal organs if\r\nthe voice is to be guided by the ear? Even if mechanical management of\r\nthe voice were possible it would be entirely superfluous. The voice\r\nneeds no other guidance than the singer's sense of hearing.\r\n\r\nHere another striking question is encountered: Why should the vocal\r\norgans be thought to be unable to adjust themselves for the tone quality\r\ndemanded by the ear any more than for the pitch? No vocal theorist has\r\never thought to formulate rules for securing the tension of the vocal\r\ncords necessary for the desired pitch. This is always left to\r\ninstinctive processes. No one would ever undertake to question the\r\nvoice's ability to sing by imitation a note of any particular pitch.\r\nWhat valid reason can be given for denying the corresponding ability\r\nregarding tone quality?\r\n\r\nOnly one answer can be made to this question. The whole matter of\r\nmechanical vocal management rests on pure assumption. No scientific\r\nproof has ever been sought for the belief that the voice requires\r\nmechanical management. This necessity is always assumed, but the\r\nassumption is utterly illogical. The vocal organs adjust themselves for\r\nthe imitation of tone quality by exactly the same psychological\r\nprocesses as for the imitation of pitch. Neither pitch nor tone quality\r\ncan be regulated in any other way than by the guidance of the ear.\r\n\r\nImitation furnishes the only means of acquiring the correct vocal\r\naction. Several authorities on the voice admit the value of imitation,\r\neven though they also make much of the mechanical doctrines of modern\r\nmethods. Sieber gives imitation as the best means of curing faults of\r\nproduction. \"The best means to free the student of the three forms of\r\nfaulty tone just described is possessed by that teacher who is able to\r\nimitate these faults with his own voice.\" (_Vollständiges Lehrbuch der\r\nGesangskunst_, Ferd. Sieber, 1858.) Dr. Mills goes further and advocates\r\nthe imitating of finished singers for the purpose of acquiring the\r\ncorrect vocal action. \"The author would recommend all students who have\r\nbegun a serious practical study of the registers to hear, if possible,\r\nsome singer of eminence who observes register formation strictly.\"\r\n(_Voice Production in Singing and Speaking_, Phila., 1906.) Kofler even\r\ndeclares that imitation is an indispensable element of instruction. \"It\r\nis just as difficult or impossible to learn to sing good tones without\r\nhearing the teacher's pure model tone as it is difficult or impossible\r\nto learn to speak without hearing.\" (_The Art of Breathing_, Leo Kofler,\r\n1889.)\r\n\r\nIf the correct vocal action is to be acquired by imitation, of what use\r\nare the mechanical doctrines of vocal management? Kofler seeks to\r\ncombine these two forms of instruction. \"Physiological theories must go\r\nhand in hand with the musical ear or the law of imitation.\"\r\nScientifically considered, this attempted combination of mechanical\r\nvocal training and instruction by imitation is an utter absurdity. There\r\nis no possibility of connection between vocal imitation and mechanical\r\nvocal management. Reliance on the imitative faculty involves the utter\r\nrejection of the mechanical idea. Compromise, or combination of the two,\r\nis a logical absurdity. Imitation and attempted mechanical management of\r\nthe voice are absolutely incompatible. Any attempt consciously to direct\r\nthe muscular workings of the vocal organs is an interference with the\r\nnormal action of the voice. So soon as conscious mechanical management\r\nof the voice is attempted throat stiffness results, and the voice is\r\nhampered in the exercise of its instinctive faculty of imitation. It is\r\nimpossible to acquire the correct vocal action by the application of\r\nmechanical rules, because a consistent following of mechanical doctrines\r\nutterly prevents the vocal organs from operating normally, even though\r\nthe student try at the same time to guide the voice by the sense of\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nA close scrutiny of the practices of modern vocal teachers reveals\r\nconvincing evidence that all their successes are due to a reliance,\r\nconscious or unconscious, on the imitative faculty. Teachers are as a\r\nrule not aware of the appeal to the instinct of imitation; neither\r\nindeed do the students usually pay much attention to this feature of\r\ntheir lessons. Much of modern vocal instruction is dual in character.\r\nWhen, for example, the teacher wishes to correct a marked fault in the\r\npupil's tone-production, he adopts this dual mode of imparting his\r\nideas. First, he explains to the pupil the (supposed) mechanical\r\noperation; second, he imitates the pupil's faulty production and then\r\nsings a correct tone to show how it should be produced.\r\n\r\nFor the teacher to sing the correct tone takes but a few seconds and\r\nrequires almost no thought. The mechanical explanation, on the other\r\nhand, calls for much more of time, and of voluntary attention, from both\r\nmaster and student. It thus follows that they both look upon the\r\nmechanical rule as the important matter, and consider the teacher's\r\nperfect tone as merely an illustration of the rule.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the student strives to apply the mechanical rule,\r\nparticularly in home practice between lessons. Under these circumstances\r\nthe voice does not respond satisfactorily. But it often happens that the\r\nstudent pays little attention to the mechanical rule, and simply\r\nimitates the teacher's voice. There being then nothing to interfere, the\r\nstudent's voice naturally responds. The master ascribes this\r\nsatisfactory result to the application of the mechanical doctrine, while\r\nin fact the result is due to the student's complete ignoring of the\r\ndoctrine.\r\n\r\nVocal imitation is often completely unconscious. Individuals vary\r\ngreatly, as regards the tendency to unconscious imitation. Of two\r\nEnglish lads coming to America at the age of fifteen, one may be found\r\nten years later to have entirely lost the English accent, the other may\r\nretain it all his life. This difference in individual traits has much\r\nto do with determining to what extent the vocal student may\r\nunconsciously imitate correct models of singing. Other characteristics\r\nare also influential in this regard. Some students so dislike to sing\r\nmechanically that they neglect, in their home study, to practise their\r\nexercises in the prescribed way. This is often due to an instinctive\r\nabhorrence of harsh sounds. Other students are so gifted with the true\r\nfeeling for vocal melody that mechanical instruction makes no impression\r\non them.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the reliance on the imitative faculty in modern vocal\r\ninstruction is entirely unconscious on the part of both master and\r\npupil. Adherence to the mechanical idea excludes from the student's mind\r\nall thought of any means of vocal guidance other than mechanical. This\r\nis true, even in the most common form of instruction, imitation and\r\nmechanical doctrine combined. As regards the master, his only conscious\r\nexercise of the imitative faculty is the reproduction of the pupil's\r\nfaulty tones. He seldom thinks of telling the pupil to imitate his own\r\ncorrectly produced tones.\r\n\r\nImitation supplies the only practical means for training voices. All the\r\nelements of Voice Culture are combined in one simple process, when the\r\nmaster sings correctly, and the student imitates the master. This\r\nexercise of the imitative faculty may be made to suffice for both the\r\ntraining of the ear and the cultivation of the voice. On practical, as\r\nwell as on scientific grounds, imitation is the only rational basis of a\r\nmethod of Voice Culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE OLD ITALIAN METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the believer in the necessity of direct mechanical management of the\r\nvoice, the old Italian method is a complete mystery. Modern vocal\r\ntheorists are at a loss to account for the success of the old masters in\r\ntraining voices. Many authorities go so far as to assert that these\r\nmasters possessed some insight into the operations of the vocal organs,\r\nalong the lines of accepted Vocal Science. In their introductory\r\nchapter, \"A Plea for Vocal Physiology,\" Browne and Behnke attempt to\r\nprove that the old masters studied the anatomy of the vocal organs. But\r\neven if this could be proved, that would not solve the mystery of the\r\nold method. Modern teachers are certainly as well acquainted with the\r\nmechanical features of tone-production as the old masters were. Yet,\r\njudged by their results, modern methods are distinctly inferior to the\r\nold Italian method.\r\n\r\nThere is absolutely no ground for the belief that the old masters owed\r\ntheir success to a knowledge of vocal physiology. This idea of ascribing\r\nscientific knowledge to the early teachers results only from erroneous\r\nbelief that no other means of training the voice is possible. It may be\r\nset down as absolutely certain that the old method was not based on the\r\nprinciples of the accepted Vocal Science.\r\n\r\nYet the old masters undoubtedly possessed some means of training voices.\r\nThey must have known something about the voice. Their knowledge,\r\nwhatever it was, is commonly believed to have been lost. Many modern\r\nteachers claim to have inherited the old method. Still these teachers\r\nhave nothing to offer beyond the well-known doctrines of breathing,\r\nbreath-control, forward tone, etc. How these doctrines might have been\r\napplied in practical instruction nobody is able to tell. Little\r\nattention need be paid to the claim of any modern teacher to possess the\r\nold Italian method of training voices.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1847 Garcia remarked the dearth of information of a literary\r\ncharacter bearing on the old method. \"Unfortunately this epoch has left\r\nus only vague and incomplete documents bearing on its traditions. Of the\r\nmethods then followed we have only an approximate and confused idea.\"\r\n(_École de Garcia_, Mayence, 1847.) Although familiar with the works of\r\nTosi and Mancini, Garcia was unable to find in their writings any hint\r\nof the means used for imparting the correct vocal action. This same\r\nremark is made by many other investigators.\r\n\r\nYet a reconstruction of the old method is not necessarily a matter of\r\nconjecture. Once the possibility of training the voice by imitation is\r\nestablished, the old Italian method is easily understood. Speaking of\r\nthe glorious past of the art of Voice Culture, Dr. Mills says: \"We have\r\nadvanced, musically, in many respects since the days of the old Italian\r\nmasters, but just as we must turn to the Greeks to learn what\r\nconstitutes the highest and best in sculpture, so must we sit at the\r\nfeet of these old masters. Consciously or unconsciously they taught on\r\nsound physiological principles.\" (_Voice Production in Singing and\r\nSpeaking._)\r\n\r\nDr. Mills' statement might be more complete if it were made to read,\r\n\"consciously or unconsciously they taught on sound physiological and\r\npsychological principles.\" Vocal instruction on sound principles is\r\nsimply the training of the voice by imitation. With the scientific basis\r\nof their method--the laws of physiological psychology--the old masters\r\nwere utterly unacquainted. Vocal imitation is purely instinctive.\r\nProbably the old masters could not even have formulated a concise\r\nstatement of their reasons for relying on the imitative faculty.\r\n\r\nGarcia's complaint of the dearth of literary information regarding the\r\nold method is by no means justified. Naturally there is no record of any\r\nmeans for imparting a direct mechanical management of the voice. Nothing\r\nof the kind was thought of. But as a description of a course in voice\r\ntraining by imitation, the works of Tosi and Mancini leave little to be\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nBoth Tosi and Mancini devote by far the greater portion of their books\r\nto describing the ornaments and embellishments of vocal music. They take\r\nup the singer's education from the beginning and seem to assume, as a\r\nmatter of course, that the training in the art of music is coincident,\r\nif not indeed identical, with the cultivation of the voice. But they do\r\nnot by any means neglect the subject of tone-production. Most modern\r\nreaders of these early writers overlook the simple directions given for\r\nsecuring a proper use of the voice. This is, of course, due to the\r\ncurrent belief that directions for vocal management must of necessity\r\ndeal with mechanical and muscular operations. Finding nothing of this\r\nkind in Tosi and Mancini, the modern investigator concludes that these\r\nwriters for some reason failed to record the means used for imparting\r\nthe correct vocal action. All that can be found by such an investigator\r\nin the works of Tosi and Mancini is an outline of an elaborate system of\r\ncoloratura singing. Much more is seen when the meaning of imitative\r\nVoice Culture is understood.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the \"Observations\" of Tosi. This writer devotes\r\nhis first few pages to some remarks on the art of singing, and to a\r\ngeneral consideration of the practices of Voice Culture. Almost at the\r\noutset we meet this striking statement: \"It would be needless to say\r\nthat verbal instruction would be of no use to singers any farther than\r\nto prevent 'em falling into errors, and that it is practice alone can\r\nset them right.\" That is certainly a sound principle.\r\n\r\nConsider also this passage. \"The faults in singing insinuate themselves\r\nso easily into the minds of young beginners, and there are such\r\ndifficulties in correcting them, when grown into an habit, that it were\r\nto be wished the ablest singers would undertake the task of teaching,\r\nthey best knowing how to conduct the scholar from the first elements to\r\nperfection. But there being none (if I mistake not) but who abhor the\r\nthoughts of it, we must reserve them for those delicacies of the art,\r\nwhich enchant the soul. Therefore the first rudiments necessarily fall\r\nto a master of a lower rank, till the scholar can sing his part at\r\nsight; whom one would at least wish to be an honest man, diligent and\r\nexperienced, without the defects of singing through the nose, or in the\r\nthroat, and that he have a command of voice, some glimpse of a good\r\ntaste, able to make himself understood with ease, a perfect intonation,\r\nand a patience to endure the fatigue of a most tiresome employment.\"\r\n\r\nThis brings out three striking facts. First, that the student learned to\r\nuse his voice by imitating the voice of the master. Second, that the\r\ninitial work of \"voice placing\" was merely an incident in the training\r\nin sight singing and the rudiments of music. Third, that \"voice placing\"\r\nwas considered of too little importance to claim the attention of\r\nmasters of the first rank. This feature of instruction, so important now\r\nas to overshadow all else, was at that time left to masters of a lower\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nThis passage is followed by a short discourse on the rudiments of _Sol\r\nFa_, a subject of only academic interest to the modern student. We are\r\nso thoroughly accustomed nowadays to the diatonic scale that it is\r\nalmost impossible for us to understand the old system of _Muance_ or\r\n_Solmisation_. Suffice it to say that only four keys were known, and\r\nthat each note was called by its full Sol-Fa name. Thus D was called\r\n_D-la-sol-re_, C was _C-sol-fa-ut_, etc. In studying sight singing, the\r\nstudent pronounced the full name of each note in every exercise.\r\nInstruction in singing began with this study of sight reading. In the\r\ncourse of this practice the student somehow learned to produce his voice\r\ncorrectly.\r\n\r\nTosi does not leave us in doubt what was to be done in order to lead\r\nthe pupil to adopt a correct manner of tone-production. \"Let the master\r\ndo his utmost to make the scholar hit and sound the notes perfectly in\r\ntune in _Sol-Fa-ing_.... Let the master attend with great care to the\r\nvoice of the scholar, which should always come forth neat and clear,\r\nwithout passing through the nose or being choaked in the throat.\" To\r\nsing in tune and to produce tones of good quality,--this summed up for\r\nTosi the whole matter of tone-production.\r\n\r\nMany teachers in the old days composed _Sol-Fa_ exercises and vocalises\r\nfor their own use. Tosi did not think this indispensable. But he points\r\nout the need of the teacher having an extensive repertoire of graded\r\nexercises and vocalises. To his mind these should always be melodious\r\nand singable. \"If the master does not understand composition let him\r\nprovide himself with good examples of _Sol-Fa-ing_ in divers stiles,\r\nwhich insensibly lead from the most easy to the most difficult,\r\naccording as he finds the scholar improves; with this caution, that\r\nhowever difficult, they may be always natural and agreeable, to induce\r\nthe scholar to study with pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nHow many months of study were supposed to be required for this\r\npreliminary course we have no means of judging from Tosi's work. At any\r\nrate the combining of the registers was accomplished during this time.\r\nTosi's description of the registers is very concise. \"_Voce di Petto_ is\r\na full voice which comes from the breast by strength, and is the most\r\nsonorous and expressive. _Voce di Testa_ comes more from the throat than\r\nfrom the breast, and is capable of more volubility. _Falsetto_ is a\r\nfeigned voice which is formed entirely in the throat, has more\r\nvolubility than any, but of no substance.\" He speaks of the necessity of\r\nuniting the registers, but gives no directions how this is to be\r\naccomplished. Evidently this seemed to him to present no difficulty\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIn this early period of instruction the pupil was exercised in both\r\n_portamento_ and _messa di voce_. \"Let him learn the manner to glide\r\nwith the vowels, and to drag the voice gently from the high to the lower\r\nnote.... In the same lessons let him teach the art to put forth the\r\nvoice, which consists in letting it swell by degrees from the softest\r\n_Piano_ to the loudest _Forte_, and from thence with the same art return\r\nfrom the _Forte_ to the _Piano_. A beautiful _Messa di Voce_ can never\r\nfail of having an excellent effect.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the first chapter of Tosi's book is devoted to this initial study.\r\nThat the student was expected to make steady progress as a result of\r\nthis study is evident from the closing sentence of this chapter. \"The\r\nscholar having now made some remarkable progress, the instructor may\r\nacquaint him with the first embellishments of the art, which are the\r\n_Appoggiaturas_, and apply them to the vowels.\" The remainder of the\r\nwork is devoted almost entirely to the embellishments of singing. Here\r\nand there an interesting passage is found. \"After the scholar has made\r\nhimself perfect in the Shake and the Divisions, the master should let\r\nhim read and pronounce the words.\" (Shake was the old name for trill,\r\nand division for run.) Again, \"I return to the master only to put him in\r\nmind that his duty is to teach musick; and if the scholar, before he\r\ngets out of his hands, does not sing readily and at sight, the innocent\r\nis injured without remedy from the guilty.\" This injunction might well\r\nbe taken to heart by the modern teacher. Good sight readers are rare\r\nnowadays, outside of chorus choirs.\r\n\r\nMancini begins his outline of the course of instruction in singing with\r\nthis striking sentence: \"Nothing is more insufferable and more\r\ninexcusable in a musician than wrong intonation; singing in the throat\r\nor in the nose will certainly be tolerated rather than singing out of\r\ntune.\" This is followed by the advice to the teacher to ascertain beyond\r\na doubt that a prospective pupil is endowed with a true musical ear.\r\nThis being done the pupil is to begin his studies by _sol-fa_-ing the\r\nscales. \"Having determined the disposition and capacity of the student\r\nwith respect to intonation, and finding him able and disposed to\r\nsucceed, let him fortify himself in correct intonation by _sol-fa_-ing\r\nthe scale, ascending and descending. This must be executed with\r\nscrupulous attention in order that the notes may be perfectly intoned.\"\r\n\r\nIn this practice the quality of the tone is of the highest importance.\r\n\"The utmost care is necessary with the student to render him able to\r\nmanage this portion of his voice with the proper sweetness and\r\nproportion.\" Mancini takes it for granted that the student will progress\r\nsteadily on account of this practice. \"When the teacher observes that\r\nthe pupil is sufficiently free in delivering the voice, in intonation,\r\nand in naming the notes, let him waste no time, but have the pupil\r\nvocalize without delay.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the registers, Mancini disagrees with Tosi and names only two.\r\n\"Voices ordinarily divide themselves into two registers which are\r\ncalled, one of the chest, the other of the head, or falsetto.\" His\r\nmethod was to exercise the voice at first in the chest register, and\r\nthen gradually to extend the compass of the voice upward. \"Every student\r\ncan for himself with perfect ease recognize the difference between these\r\ntwo separate registers. It will suffice therefore to commence by singing\r\nthe scale, for example, if a soprano, from G to d;[10] let him take care\r\nthat these five notes are sonorous, and say them with force and\r\nclearness, and without effort.\" For uniting the registers, \"the most\r\ncertain means is to hold back the tones of the chest and to sing the\r\ntransition notes in the head register, increasing the power little by\r\nlittle.\"\r\n\r\n[Note 10: Mancini of course uses the _Sol-Fa_ names of these notes.]\r\n\r\nMancini devotes a few pages to a description of the vocal organs. This\r\nfact is cited by several modern theorists in support of their statement\r\nthat the old masters based their methods on mechanical principles. In\r\nthe following chapter this topic of Mancini's treatise will be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nProbably the best summary of the old Italian method offered by any\r\nmodern teacher is contained in a little booklet by J. Frank Botume,\r\nentitled _Modern Singing Methods_. (Boston, 1885. The citations are from\r\nthe fourth edition, 1896.) Speaking of the meaning of the word method,\r\nas applied to a system of rules for acquiring the correct vocal action,\r\nthis writer says: \"If a teacher says, 'that tone is harsh, sing more\r\nsweetly,' he has given no method to his pupil. He has asked the scholar\r\nto change his tone, but has not shown him how to do it. If, on the other\r\nhand, he directs the pupil to keep back the pressure of the breath, or\r\nto change the location of the tone; if he instructs him in regard to the\r\ncorrect use of his vocal cords, or speaks of the position of his tongue,\r\nof his diaphragm, of his mouth, etc., he gives him method. The Italian\r\nteachers of the early period of this art had so little method that it\r\ncan hardly be said to have existed with them. In fact, the word method,\r\nas now used, is of comparatively modern origin. The founders of the art\r\nof singing aimed at results directly; the manner of using the vocal\r\napparatus for the purpose of reaching these results troubled them\r\ncomparatively little. The old Italian teacher took the voice as he found\r\nit. He began with the simplest and easiest work, and trusted to patient\r\nand long-continued exercise to develop the vocal apparatus. In all this\r\nthere is no method as we understand the term. The result is aimed at\r\ndirectly. The manner of getting it is not shown. There is no conscious\r\ncontrol of the vocal apparatus for the purpose of effecting a certain\r\nresult.\"\r\n\r\nThis sums up beautifully the external aspects of the old Italian method,\r\nand of modern methods as well. It points out clearly the difference\r\nbetween the old and the modern system. But it is a mistake to say that\r\nthe old masters followed no systematized plan of instruction. Tosi's\r\nadvice, already quoted (\"Let the master provide himself with examples of\r\nSol-fa, leading insensibly from the easy to the difficult,\" etc.), shows\r\na thorough grasp of the meaning of methodical instruction. Once the real\r\nnature of vocal training is understood, both Tosi and Mancini are seen\r\nto describe a well worked out system of Voice Culture. The only\r\nimportant difference between the old and the new system is this: one\r\nrelied on instinctive and imitative processes for imparting the correct\r\nvocal action, the other seeks to accomplish the same result through the\r\nmechanical management of the vocal organs. In this regard the advantage\r\nis all on the side of the old Italian method.\r\n\r\nOne question regarding the old method remains to be answered. This has\r\nto do with the use of the empirical precepts in practical instruction.\r\nSo far as the written record goes we have no means of answering this\r\nquestion. Neither Tosi nor Mancini mentions the old precepts in any way.\r\nThe answer can therefore be only conjectural. We may at once dismiss the\r\nidea that the old masters used the precepts in the currently accepted\r\nmanner as rules for the mechanical management of the voice. This\r\napplication of the empirical precepts followed upon the acceptance of\r\nthe idea of mechanical voice culture.\r\n\r\nA fine description of perfect singing, considered empirically, was found\r\nto be embodied in the traditional precepts. Such a description of\r\ncorrectly produced tone might be of great value in the training of the\r\near. The sense of hearing is developed by listening; and attentive\r\nlistening is rendered doubly effective in the singer's education by the\r\nattention being consciously directed to particular characteristics of\r\nthe sounds observed.\r\n\r\nA highly important aspect of ear training in Voice Culture is the\r\nacquainting the student with the highest standards of singing. The\r\nstudent derives a double advantage from listening to artistic singing\r\nwhen he knows what to listen for. Telling the student that in perfect\r\nsinging the throat seems to be open makes him keenly attentive in\r\nobserving this characteristic sound of the correctly produced tone. This\r\nseems to be the most effective manner of utilizing the empirical\r\nprecepts. A student may be helped in imitating correct models of singing\r\nby knowing what characteristics of the tones it is most important to\r\nreproduce. In pointing out to the student his own faults of production,\r\nthe judicious use of the precepts might also be of considerable value.\r\nProbably the old masters treated the precepts about in this fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE OLD ITALIAN METHOD AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF\r\nMECHANICAL INSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most mysterious facts in the history of Voice Culture is the\r\nutter disappearance of the old Italian method. This has occurred in\r\nspite of the earnest efforts of vocal teachers to preserve the old\r\ntraditions. If the conclusions drawn in the preceding chapter are\r\njustified, the old method consisted of a system of teaching singing by\r\nimitation. Assuming this to be true, there should now be no difficulty\r\nin accounting for the disappearance of the imitative method by tracing\r\nthe development of the mechanical idea.\r\n\r\nImitative Voice Culture was purely empirical in the ordinary meaning of\r\nthis word. The old masters did not knowingly base their instruction on\r\nany set of principles. They simply taught as their instincts prompted\r\nthem. There can now be no doubt that the old masters were fully\r\njustified in their empiricism. They taught singing as Nature intends it\r\nto be taught. But the old masters were not aware of the scientific\r\nsoundness of their position. So soon as the correctness of empirical\r\nteaching was questioned they abandoned it without an attempt at defense.\r\nAs a system of Voice Culture, the old method occupied a weak strategic\r\nposition. With absolute right on its side, it still had no power of\r\nresistance against hostile influences.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply that the old masters were ignorant men. On the\r\ncontrary, the intellectual standard of the vocal profession seems to\r\nhave been fully as high two hundred years ago as to-day. Even famous\r\ncomposers and musical theorists did not disdain to teach singing. But\r\nthis very fact, the generally high culture of the old masters, was an\r\nimportant factor in the weakness of the old method against attack. The\r\nmost intelligent masters were the ones most likely to abandon the\r\nempirical system in favor of supposedly scientific and precise methods\r\nof instruction.\r\n\r\nThe hostile influence to which the old Italian method succumbed was the\r\nidea of mechanical vocal management. This idea entered almost\r\nimperceptibly into the minds of vocal teachers in the guise of a\r\nscientific theory of Voice Culture. A short historical sketch will bring\r\nthis fact out clearly. This necessitates a repetition of some of the\r\nmaterial of Chapter I of Part I; the entire subject will however appear\r\nin a new light now that the true nature of the mechanical idea is\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nFrom the founding of the art of Voice Culture, about 1600, up to 1741,\r\nno vocalist seems to have paid any attention to the anatomy or muscular\r\nmovements of the vocal organs. In 1741 a French physician, Ferrein,\r\npresented to the Academy of Sciences a treatise on the anatomy of the\r\nvocal organs, entitled \"De la Formation de la Voix de l'Homme.\" This\r\ntreatise was published in the same year, and it seems to have attracted\r\nat once the attention of the most enlightened masters of singing. That\r\nFerrein was the first to call the attention of vocalists to the\r\nmechanical features of tone-production is strongly indicated in the\r\nGerman translation of Tosi's \"Observations.\" In the original Italian\r\nedition, 1723, and the English translation, 1742, there is absolutely no\r\nmention of the anatomy or physiology of the vocal organs. But in\r\npreparing the German edition, published in 1757, the translator, J. F.\r\nAgricola, inserted a description of the vocal organs which he credited\r\ndirectly to Ferrein.\r\n\r\nMancini followed Agricola's example, and included in this \"Riflessioni\"\r\n(1776) a brief description of the vocal organs. But Mancini made no\r\nattempt to apply this description in formulating a system of\r\ninstruction. He recommends the parents of a prospective singer to\r\nascertain, by a physician's examination, that the child's vocal organs\r\nare normal and in good health. He also gives one mechanical rule, so\r\nobvious as to seem rather quaint. \"Every singer must place his mouth in\r\na natural smiling position, that is, with the upper teeth\r\nperpendicularly and moderately removed from the lower.\" Beyond this\r\nMancini says not a word of mechanical vocal management. There is no\r\nmention of breathing, or tone reflection, or laryngeal action. Although\r\nMancini borrowed his description of the vocal organs from Ferrein, his\r\nnotion of the mechanics of tone-production was very crude. \"The air of\r\nthe lungs operates on the larynx in singing exactly as it operates on\r\nthe head of the flute.\"\r\n\r\nVoice Culture has passed through three successive periods. From 1600 to\r\n1741 instruction in singing was purely empirical. Ferrein's treatise may\r\nbe said to mark the beginning of a transition period during which\r\nempirical instruction was gradually displaced by so-called scientific\r\nmethods. This transition period lasted, roughly speaking, till the\r\ninvention of the laryngoscope in 1855. Since that time vocal instruction\r\nhas been carried on almost exclusively along mechanical lines.\r\n\r\nNo vocal teacher had ever heard of a problem of tone-production previous\r\nto 1741, and indeed for many years thereafter. The earlier masters were\r\nnot aware of any possibility of difficulty in causing the voice to\r\noperate properly. Their success justified their ignoring of any\r\nmechanical basis of instruction; but even of this justification the\r\nlater masters of the old school were only dimly conscious. They builded\r\nbetter than they knew. When any teacher of the transition period was\r\ncalled upon to explain his manner of imparting the correct vocal action\r\nhe was at once put on the defensive. No champion of the imitative\r\nfaculty could be found. This lack of understanding of the basis of the\r\nempirical method, on the part of its most intelligent and successful\r\nexponents, was the first cause of the weakness of this method against\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nAnother source of weakness in the hold of empirical systems on the vocal\r\nprofession was seen in the generally high intellectual standard of the\r\nmore prominent teachers. These masters gladly accepted the new knowledge\r\nof the basis of their art, offered them in the description of the vocal\r\norgans. Thoroughly conversant with every detail of the empirical\r\nknowledge of the voice, the masters of the transition period were well\r\nprepared to understand something of the mechanical features of\r\ntone-production. By their auditory and muscular sensations of vocal tone\r\nthey were able, to their own satisfaction at least, to verify the\r\nstatements of the anatomists.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy for us to put ourselves mentally in the position of a\r\nvocalist, thoroughly familiar with the empirical knowledge of the voice,\r\nand yet ignorant of the first principles of vocal mechanics. In all\r\nprobability the early masters were not even aware that tone is produced\r\nby the action of the breath on the larynx. They did not know that\r\ndifferent qualities and pitches result from special adjustments and\r\ncontractions of the throat muscles. Yet they were keenly aware of all\r\nthe muscular sensations resulting from these contractions. We can well\r\nimagine how interesting these vocalists of the early transition period\r\nmust have found the description of the cartilages and muscles of the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us but a short step from the study of vocal mechanics to the\r\napplication of the results of this study in the formulating of a\r\npractical system of vocal instruction. Yet it required more than sixty\r\nyears for the vocal profession to travel so far. Even then the true\r\nbearing of this development of Voice Culture was but dimly realized. In\r\n1800 the mechanical management of the voice was not even thought of.\r\nThis is conclusively proved by a most important work, the _Méthode de\r\nChant du Conservatoire de Musique_, published in Paris in 1803.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question that this Méthode represents the most\r\nenlightened and advanced thought of the vocal profession of that day.\r\nNot only does it contain everything then known about the training of the\r\nvoice; it was drawn up with the same exhaustive care and analytical\r\nattention to detail that were devoted to the formulation of the metric\r\nsystem. To mechanical rules less than one page is devoted. Respiration\r\nis the only subject to receive more than a few lines. A system of\r\nbreathing with flat abdomen and high chest is outlined, and the student\r\nis instructed to practise breathing exercises daily. Five lines are\r\ncontained in the chapter headed \"De l'emission du son,\" and these five\r\nlines are simply a warning against throaty and nasal _quality_. The\r\npupil is told to stand erect, and to open the mouth properly. But a\r\nfoot-note is given to the rule for the position of the mouth which shows\r\nhow thoroughly the mechanical rule was subordinated to considerations of\r\ntone quality. \"As there is no rule without exceptions, we think it\r\nuseful to observe at what opening of the mouth the pupil produces the\r\nmost agreeable, sonorous, and pure quality of tone in order to have him\r\nalways open the mouth in that manner.\" In the main the Méthode outlines\r\na purely empirical system of instruction, based on the guidance of the\r\nvoice by the ear. There can be no question that the idea of mechanical\r\nmanagement of the voice was introduced later than 1803.\r\n\r\nCitations might be made to show the gradual advance of the mechanical\r\nidea from two interesting works, _Die Kunst des Gesanges_, by Adolph B.\r\nMarx, Berlin, 1826, and _Die grosse italienische Gesangschule_, by H. F.\r\nMannstein, Dresden, 1834. But this is not necessary. It is enough to say\r\nthat Scientific Voice Culture was not generally thought to be identical\r\nwith mechanical vocal management until later than 1855.\r\n\r\nManuel Garcia was the first vocal teacher to undertake to found a\r\npractical method of instruction on the mechanical principles of the\r\nvocal action. When only twenty-seven years old, in 1832, Garcia\r\ndetermined to reform the practices of Voice Culture by furnishing an\r\nimproved method of instruction. (_Grove's Dictionary._) His first\r\ndefinite pronouncement of this purpose is contained in the preface to\r\nhis _École de Garcia_, 1847. \"As all the effects of song are, in the\r\nlast analysis, the product of the vocal organs, I have submitted the\r\nstudy to physiological considerations.\" This statement of Garcia's idea\r\nof scientific instruction strikes us as a commonplace. But that serves\r\nonly to prove how thoroughly the world has since been converted to the\r\nidea of mechanical Voice Culture. At that time it was generally believed\r\nto be a distinct advance. Garcia expected to bring about a great\r\nimprovement in the art of Voice Culture. His idea was that the voice can\r\nbe trained in less time and with greater certainty by mechanical than by\r\nimitative methods. As for the inherent falsity of this idea, that has\r\nbeen sufficiently exposed.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the theory of mechanical vocal management began to find\r\nacceptance, the old method yielded the ground to the new idea. That this\r\noccurred so easily was due to a number of causes. Of these several have\r\nalready been noted,--the readiness of the most prominent teachers to\r\nbroaden their field of knowledge, in particular. Other causes\r\ncontributing to the acceptance of the mechanical idea were the elusive\r\ncharacter of empirical knowledge of the voice, and the unconscious\r\naspect of the instinct of vocal imitation. No master of the later\r\ntransition period deliberately discarded his empirical knowledge. This\r\ncould have been possible only by the master losing his sense of hearing.\r\nNeither did the master cease to rely on the imitative faculty. Although\r\nunconsciously exercised, that was a habit too firmly fixed to be even\r\nintentionally abandoned.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion also had much to do with the spread of the mechanical\r\nidea. Teachers found that they could get pupils easier by claiming to\r\nunderstand the mechanical workings of the voice. In order to obtain\r\nrecognition, teachers were obliged to study vocal mechanics and to adapt\r\ntheir methods to the growing demand for scientific instruction.\r\n\r\nNo master of this period seems to have intentionally abandoned the\r\ntraditional method. Their first purpose in adopting the new scientific\r\nidea was to elucidate and fortify the old method. Every successful\r\nmaster undoubtedly taught many pupils who in their turn became teachers.\r\nThere must have been, in each succession of master and pupil, one\r\nteacher who failed to transmit the old method in its entirety. Both\r\nmaster and pupil must have been unconscious of this. No master can be\r\nbelieved to have deliberately withheld any of his knowledge from his\r\npupils. Neither can any student have been aware that he failed to\r\nreceive his master's complete method.\r\n\r\nLet us consider a typical instance of master and pupil in the later\r\ntransition period. Instruction in this case was probably of a dual\r\ncharacter. Both teacher and pupil devoted most of their attention to the\r\nmechanical features of tone-production. Yet the master continued to\r\nlisten closely to the student's voice, just as he had done before\r\nadopting the (supposedly) scientific idea of instruction. Unconsciously\r\nhe led the pupil to listen and imitate. When the student found it\r\ndifficult to apply the mechanical instruction the master would say,\r\n\"Listen to me and do as I do.\" Naturally this would bring the desired\r\nresult. Yet both master and pupil would attribute the result to the\r\napplication of the mechanical rule. The student's voice would be\r\nsuccessfully trained, but he would carry away an erroneous idea of the\r\nmeans by which this was accomplished. Becoming a teacher in his turn,\r\nthe vocalist taught in this fashion would entirely overlook the\r\nunobtrusive element of imitation and would devote himself to mechanical\r\ninstruction. He would, for example, construe the precept, \"Sing with\r\nopen throat,\" as a rule to be directly applied; that he had acquired the\r\nopen throat by imitating his master's tones this teacher would be\r\nutterly unaware.\r\n\r\nMore than one generation of master and pupil was probably concerned, in\r\neach succession, in the gradual loss of the substance of the old method.\r\nThe possibility of learning to sing by imitation was only gradually lost\r\nto sight. This is well expressed by Paolo Guetta. \"The aphorism 'listen\r\nand imitate,' which was the device of the ancient school, coming down by\r\nway of tradition, underwent the fate of all sane precepts passed along\r\nfrom generation to generation. Through elimination and individual\r\nadaptation, through assuming the personal imprint, it degenerated into a\r\npurely empirical formula.\" (_Il Canto nel suo Mecanismo_, Milan, 1902.)\r\n\r\nGuetta is himself evidently at a loss to grasp the significance of the\r\nempirical formula, \"Listen and imitate.\" He seems however to be aware of\r\nan antagonism between imitation and mechanical vocal management. The\r\nreason of this antagonism has already been noticed, but it will bear\r\nrepetition. For a teacher to tell a pupil to \"hold your throat open and\r\nimitate my tone,\" is to demand the impossible. A conscious effort\r\ndirectly to hold the throat open only causes the throat to stiffen. In\r\nthis condition the normal action of the voice is upset and the pupil\r\ncannot imitate the teacher's voice.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition confronting the teacher of the second generation\r\nin the \"maestral succession\" just considered. He found his pupils unable\r\nto get with their voices the results which had come easily to him.\r\nAttributing his satisfactory progress as a student to the mastery of the\r\nsupposed mechanical principles of tone-production, this teacher ascribed\r\nhis pupil's difficulties to their failure to grasp the same mechanical\r\nideas. As a natural consequence he labored even more energetically along\r\nmechanical lines. Curiously, no teacher seems to have questioned the\r\nsoundness of the mechanical idea. Failure on the part of the pupil to\r\nobtain the correct use of the voice served only to make the master more\r\ninsistent on mechanical exercises.\r\n\r\nIn direct proportion to the prominence given to the idea of mechanical\r\nmanagement of the voice, the difficulties of teachers and students\r\nbecame ever more pronounced. The trouble caused by throat stiffness led\r\nthe teachers to seek new means for imparting the correct vocal action,\r\nalways along mechanical lines. In this way the progress of the\r\nmechanical idea was accelerated, and the problem of tone-production\r\nreceived ever more attention.\r\n\r\nFaith in the imitative faculty was gradually undermined by the progress\r\nof the mechanical idea. With each succeeding generation of master and\r\npupil, the mechanical idea became more firmly established. Something\r\nakin to a vicious circle was involved in this progress. As attention was\r\npaid in practical instruction to the mechanical operations of the voice,\r\nso the voice's instinctive power of imitation was curtailed by throat\r\nstiffness. This served to make more pressing the apparent need of means\r\nfor the mechanical management of the voice. Thus the mechanical idea\r\nfound ever new arguments in its favor, based always on the difficulties\r\nitself had caused.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to assign a precise date to the disappearance of the\r\nold Italian method. The last exponent of the old traditions was\r\nFrancesco Lamperti, who retired from active teaching in 1876. Yet even\r\nLamperti finally yielded, in theory at least, to the mechanical idea. In\r\nthe closing years of his active life as a teacher (1875 and 1876),\r\nLamperti wrote a book descriptive of his method, _A Treatise on the Art\r\nof Singing_ (translated into English by J. C. Griffith and published by\r\nEd. Schuberth & Co., New York). When this work was about ready for the\r\npress, Lamperti read Dr. Mandl's _Gesundheitslehre der Stimme_,\r\ncontaining the first definite statement of the opposed-muscular-action\r\ntheory of breath-control. At the last moment Lamperti inserted a note in\r\nhis book to signify his acceptance of this theory.\r\n\r\nVocal mechanics was at first studied by teachers of singing as a matter\r\nof purely academic interest. No insufficiency of imitative teaching had\r\never been felt. Teachers of the transition period, even so late probably\r\nas 1830, had in most cases no reason to be dissatisfied with their\r\nmethods of instruction. Garcia himself started out modestly enough to\r\nplace the traditional method, received from his father, on a definite\r\nbasis. His first idea, announced in the preface to the first edition of\r\nhis _École de Garcia_, was to \"reproduce my father's method, attempting\r\nonly to give it a more theoretical form, and to connect results with\r\ncauses.\"\r\n\r\nInterest in the mechanics of the voice continued to be almost entirely\r\nacademic until the invention of the laryngoscope in 1855. Then the\r\npopular note was struck. The marvelous industrial and scientific\r\nprogress of the preceding fifty years had prepared the world to demand\r\nadvancement in methods of teaching singing, as in everything else. When\r\nthe secrets of the vocal action were laid bare, a new and better method\r\nof teaching singing was at once expected. Within very few years\r\nscientific knowledge of the voice was demanded of every vocal teacher.\r\n\r\nNothing could well be more natural than a belief in the efficacy of\r\nscientific knowledge of the vocal organs as the basis of instruction in\r\nsinging. Surely no earnest investigator of the voice can be criticized\r\nfor adopting this belief. No one ever thought of questioning the\r\nsoundness of the new scientific idea. The belief was everywhere\r\naccepted, as a matter of course, that methods of instruction in singing\r\nwere about to be vastly improved. Vocal theorists spoke confidently of\r\ndiscovering means for training the voice in a few months of study. The\r\nsinger's education under the old system had demanded from four to seven\r\nyears; science was expected to revolutionize this, and to accomplish in\r\nmonths what had formerly required years.\r\n\r\nEven then tone-production was not seen to be a distinct problem. The old\r\nimitative method was still successfully followed. No one thought of\r\ndiscarding the traditional method, but only of improving it by reducing\r\nit to scientific principles. But that could not last. Soon after the\r\nattempt began to be made to manage the voice mechanically,\r\ntone-production was found to contain a real problem. This was of course\r\ndue to the introduction of throat stiffness.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on (about 1860 to 1865), the problem of tone-production\r\nhas become steadily more difficult of solution in each individual case.\r\nThis problem has been, since 1865, the one absorbing topic of Voice\r\nCulture. Probably the most unfortunate single fact in the history of\r\nVoice Culture is that scientific study of the voice was from the\r\nbeginning confined solely to the mechanical features of tone-production.\r\nHad scientific investigators turned their attention also to the analysis\r\nof the auditory impressions of vocal tones, and to the psychological\r\naspect of tone-production, scientific instruction in singing would\r\nprobably not have been identified with mechanical management of the\r\nvoice. All the subsequent difficulties of the vocal profession would\r\nalmost certainly have been avoided.\r\n\r\nEvery attempt at a solution of the problem of tone-production has been\r\nmade along strictly mechanical lines. Attention has been devoted solely\r\nto the anatomy and physiology of the vocal organs, and to the acoustic\r\nprinciples of the vocal action. Since 1865 hardly a year has passed\r\nwithout some important contribution to the sum of knowledge of the vocal\r\nmechanism. For many years this development of Vocal Science was eagerly\r\nfollowed by the vocal teachers. Any seemingly authoritative announcement\r\nof a new theory of the voice was sure to bring its reward in an\r\nimmediate influx of earnest students. Prominent teachers made it their\r\npractice to spend their vacations in studying with the famous\r\nspecialists and investigators. Each new theory of the vocal action was\r\nat once put into practice, or at any rate this attempt was made. Yet\r\neach new attempt brought only a fresh disappointment. The mystery of the\r\nvoice was only deepened with each successive failure at solution.\r\n\r\nA review in detail of the development of Vocal Science would be of only\r\nacademic interest. Very little of practical moment would probably be\r\nadded to the outline of modern methods contained in Part I.\r\n\r\nTeachers of singing at present evince an attitude of skepticism toward\r\nnew theories of the vocal action. Voice Culture has settled along\r\nwell-established lines. In the past fifteen years little change can be\r\nnoted in the practices of vocal teachers. The mechanical idea is so\r\nfirmly established that no question is ever raised as to its scientific\r\nsoundness. Under the limitations imposed by this erroneous idea,\r\nteachers do their best to train the voices entrusted to their care.\r\n\r\nVocal Science is of vastly less importance in modern Voice Culture than\r\nthe world in general supposes. Only an imaginary relation has ever\r\nexisted between the scientific knowledge of the voice and practical\r\nmethods of instruction. To cause the summits of the arytenoid\r\ncartilages, for example, to incline toward each other is entirely beyond\r\nthe direct power of the singer. How many similar impossibilities have\r\nbeen seriously advocated can be known only to the academic student of\r\nVocal Science. Vocal teachers in general have ceased to attempt any such\r\napplication of the doctrines of Vocal Science. Even if these doctrines\r\ncould be shown to be scientifically sound it would still be impossible\r\nto devise means for applying them to the management of the voice.\r\nAccepted Vocal Science has contributed only one element of the practical\r\nscheme of modern voice culture; this is the erroneous notion that the\r\nvocal organs require to be managed mechanically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MATERIALS OF RATIONAL INSTRUCTION IN SINGING\r\n\r\n\r\nPractical methods of instruction in singing may be judged by their\r\nresults fully as well as by a scientific analysis of their basic\r\nprinciples. If the progress of the art of singing in the past fifty\r\nyears has been commensurate with the amount of study devoted to the\r\noperations of the vocal mechanism, then the value of present methods is\r\nestablished. Otherwise the need is proved for some reform in the present\r\nsystem of training voices. Judged by this standard modern methods are\r\nnot found to be satisfactory. There has been no progress in the art of\r\nsinging; exactly the contrary is the case. A prominent vocalist goes so\r\nfar as to say that \"vocal insufficiency and decay are prevalent.\" (_The\r\nSinging of the Future_, D. Frangçon-Davies, M.A., 1906.) It is perhaps\r\nan exaggeration of the condition to call it \"insufficiency and decay.\"\r\nYet a gradual decline in the art of singing must be apparent to any\r\nlover of the art who has listened to most of the famous singers of the\r\npast twenty or twenty-five years. Operatic performance has been improved\r\nin every other respect, but pure singing, the perfection of the vocal\r\nart, has become almost a rarity. This is true not only of coloratura\r\nsinging; it applies with almost equal force to the use of the singing\r\nvoice for the purpose of dramatic and emotional expression.\r\n\r\nMusical critics are beginning to comment on the decline of singing. They\r\nseek naturally for the causes of this decline. Many influences are cited\r\nby different writers, each of which has undoubtedly contributed\r\nsomething toward lowering the present standard of singing. Most\r\ninfluential among these contributing causes, in the general opinion, is\r\nthe dramatic style of singing demanded in Wagner's later operas. Yet\r\nseveral writers point out that the rôles of Tristan, Brunnhilde, etc.,\r\nare vastly more effective when well sung than when merely shouted or\r\ndeclaimed. A change in the public taste is also spoken of. Audiences are\r\nsaid to be indifferent to the older operas, written to suit the style of\r\nflorid singing. But even this statement does not pass unchallenged. A\r\nprominent critic asserts that \"the world is still hungry\" for florid\r\nsinging. \"It is altogether likely,\" continues this writer, \"that\r\ncomposers would begin to write florid works again if they were assured\r\nof competent interpretation, for there is always a public eager for\r\nmusic of this sort.\" This critic asserts that the decline of coloratura\r\nsinging is due to the indifference of the artists themselves to this\r\nstyle of singing.\r\n\r\nStill another commentator ascribes the decline of pure singing in recent\r\nyears to the rise of a new school of dramatic interpretation among the\r\nyounger operatic artists. \"Nowadays it is not the singing that counts.\r\nIt is the interpretation; and the chances are there will be more and\r\nmore interpretation and less and less singing every year.\" Even this\r\nview has its limitations. Faithful dramatic interpretation, and\r\nattention to all the details of make-up and \"business,\" are not in any\r\nway antagonistic to pure singing. One of the most potent means of\r\nemotional expression is vocal tone color. But the skilful use of\r\nexpressive tone quality is possible only to a singer possessed of a\r\nperfect command of all the resources of the voice. Many vocal\r\nshortcomings are forgiven in the singer of convincing interpretive\r\npower. This is probably an important factor in influencing the younger\r\ngeneration of artists to devote so much attention to interpretation.\r\n\r\nMore important than any of the reasons just given to account for the\r\npresent state of the art of singing, is the decline in the art of\r\ntraining voices. The prospects of an improvement in the art of Voice\r\nCulture, imagined by the early investigators of the vocal mechanism,\r\nhave not been realized. Voice Culture has not progressed in the past\r\nsixty years. Exactly the contrary has taken place. Before the\r\nintroduction of mechanical methods every earnest vocal student was sure\r\nof learning to use his voice properly, and of developing the full\r\nmeasure of his natural endowments. Mechanical instruction has upset all\r\nthis. Nowadays the successful vocal student is the exception. Even those\r\nstudents who succeed in acquiring sufficient command of their voices to\r\nwin public acceptance are unable to master the finest points of vocal\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\nPerfect singing is becoming rare, mainly because the technical mastery\r\nof the voice cannot be acquired under modern methods of instruction.\r\nThese methods have been found unsatisfactory in every way. A change must\r\nbe made in the practices of Voice Culture; its present state cannot be\r\nregarded as permanent. Modern methods are not truly scientific. There is\r\nat present no justification for the belief that the art of Voice Culture\r\nis founded an assured scientific principles. This does not by any means\r\ninvalidate the idea that Voice Culture is properly a subject for\r\nscientific regulation. Modern methods are unsatisfactory only because\r\nthey do not conform to the fundamental laws of science. In order to\r\nerect a satisfactory art of Voice Culture it is necessary only that the\r\nart be brought into conformity with scientific principles.\r\n\r\nNo sweeping reform of modern methods is called for. A thorough\r\napplication of scientific principles in the training of voices demands\r\nonly one thing,--the abandonment of the idea of mechanical vocal\r\nmanagement. This is not a backward step; on the contrary, it means a\r\ndistinct advance. Once freed from the burden of the mechanical idea, the\r\nart of Voice Culture will be in position to advance, even beyond the\r\nideals of the old masters.\r\n\r\nNothing could well be simpler than the dropping of the mechanical idea.\r\nIt was pointed out in the review of modern methods that most of the time\r\nspent in giving and taking lessons is devoted to actual singing by the\r\nstudent. This is exactly what rational instruction means. Were it not\r\nfor the evil influence of the mechanical idea, the results of present\r\ninstruction would in most cases be satisfactory. It is only in\r\nconsequence of the attention paid to the mechanical workings of the\r\nvocal organs that throat stiffness is interposed between the ear and the\r\nvoice. Let the mechanical idea be dropped, and instruction may be\r\ncarried on exactly as at present. There will be only one marked\r\ndifference,--throat stiffness will cease to be a source of difficulty.\r\n\r\nIt is for the individual teacher to change his own practices. This could\r\nbe done so easily that students would hardly note a change in the form\r\nof instruction. Simply call the pupil's attention always to the quality\r\nof the tones, and never to the throat. Cease to talk of breathing and of\r\nlaryngeal action, and these subjects will never suggest themselves to\r\nthe student's mind. Continue to have the student sing vocalises, scales,\r\nsongs, and arias, just as at present. Teach the student to listen\r\nclosely to his own voice, and familiarize him with correct models of\r\nsinging. This covers the whole ground of rational Voice Culture.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that a vocal student comes to the\r\nteacher with a definite idea of the need of direct vocal management.\r\nSeveral months of study are required before the student begins to grasp\r\nthe teacher's idea of mechanical management of the voice. Even then the\r\nstudent rarely comes to a clear understanding of the mechanical idea. In\r\nthe great majority of cases the student never gets beyond the vague\r\nnotion that he must \"do something\" to bring the tones. Yet this vague\r\nidea is enough to keep his attention constantly directed to his vocal\r\norgans, and so to hamper their normal activity. So soon as a teacher\r\ndrops the mechanical idea, his pupils will not think of their throats,\r\nnor demand mechanical instruction. There will be no need of his\r\ncautioning his pupils not to pay attention to the muscular workings of\r\nthe vocal organs. No vocal student ever would do this were the practice\r\nnot demanded in modern methods.\r\n\r\nAt first thought it may seem that for a teacher to drop all mechanical\r\ninstruction would leave a great gap in his method. How is the correct\r\nvocal action to be imparted to the pupil if not by direct instruction to\r\nthis end? This question has already been answered in preceding chapters,\r\nbut the answer may well be repeated. The correct vocal action is\r\nnaturally and instinctively adopted by the voice without any attention\r\nbeing paid to the operations of the vocal mechanism. It is necessary\r\nonly that the student sing his daily exercises and listen to his voice.\r\nThe voice's own instinct will lead it gradually to the perfect action.\r\nNothing need be substituted for mechanical instruction. Present methods\r\nof Voice Culture will be in every way complete, they will leave nothing\r\nto be desired, when the mechanical idea is abandoned. This change in the\r\ncharacter of vocal instruction will not be in any sense a return to\r\nempiricism. It will be a distinct advance in the application of\r\nscientific principles.\r\n\r\nWhen fully understood, a practical science of Voice Culture is seen to\r\nembrace only three topics,--the musical education of the student, the\r\ntraining of the ear, and the acquirement of skill in the use of the\r\nvoice. The avoidance of throat stiffness is not properly a separate\r\ntopic of Vocal Science, as in rational instruction nothing should ever\r\nbe done to cause the throat to stiffen. Let us consider in detail these\r\nthree topics of practical Vocal Science.\r\n\r\n_The Musical Education of a Singer_\r\n\r\nEvery singer should be a well-educated and accomplished musician. This\r\ndoes not mean that the singer must be a capable performer on the piano\r\nor violin; yet some facility in playing the piano is of enormous benefit\r\nto the singer. A general understanding of the art of music is not\r\nnecessarily dependent on the ability to play any instrument. The\r\nrudiments of music may quite well be mastered through the study of sight\r\nsinging. This was the course adopted by the old masters, and it will\r\nserve equally well in our day.\r\n\r\nOne of the evil results of the introduction of the mechanical idea in\r\nVoice Culture is that almost the entire lesson time is devoted to the\r\nmatter of tone-production. To the rudiments of music no attention\r\nwhatever is usually paid. Many vocal students realize the need of a\r\ngeneral musical training, and seek it through studying the piano and\r\nthrough choir and chorus singing. But the vocal teacher seldom finds\r\ntime to teach his pupils to read music at sight. This is a serious\r\nmistake. The artistic use of the voice is dependent on the possession of\r\na trained ear and a cultured musical taste. Ear training and musical\r\nculture are greatly facilitated by a knowledge of the technical basis of\r\nthe art of music. This latter is best acquired, by the vocal student at\r\nany rate, through the study of sight reading.\r\n\r\nSight singing and the rudiments of music are taught to better advantage\r\nin class work than in private individual instruction. The class system\r\nalso secures a great saving of time to the teacher. Every teacher should\r\nform a little class in sight reading and choral singing, made up of all\r\nhis pupils. An hour or an hour and a half each week, devoted by the\r\nentire class to the study of sight singing and simple part songs and\r\nchoruses, would give an ample training to all the pupils in this\r\nimportant branch of the art of music.\r\n\r\nMany vocal teachers advise their pupils not to sing in choirs and\r\nchoruses. There may be some ground for the belief that students are apt\r\nto fall into bad vocal habits while singing in the chorus. But this risk\r\nis entirely avoided by the teacher having his pupils sing in his own\r\nchorus, under his own direction.\r\n\r\nAnother important feature of the musical education is the hearing of\r\ngood music artistically performed. Vocal students should be urged to\r\nattend the opera and the orchestral concerts. They should become\r\nfamiliar with the different forms of composition by actually hearing the\r\nmasterpieces of music. Chamber music concerts, song recitals, and\r\noratoric performances,--all are of great advantage to the earnest\r\nstudent. When students attend the opera, or hear the great singers in\r\nconcerts and recitals, they should listen to the singers' tones, and not\r\nwonder how the tones are produced.\r\n\r\n_Ear Training_\r\n\r\nNo special exercises can be given for the training of the ear. The sense\r\nof hearing is developed only by attentive listening. Every vocal\r\nstudent should be urged, and frequently reminded, to form the habit of\r\nlistening attentively to the tones of all voices and instruments. A\r\nhighly trained sense of hearing is one of the musician's most valuable\r\ngifts. A naturally keen musical ear is of course presupposed in the case\r\nof any one desiring to study music. This natural gift must be developed\r\nby exercise in the ear's proper function,--listening to sounds.\r\n\r\nExperience in listening to voices is made doubly effective in the\r\ntraining of the ear when the student's attention is called to the\r\nsalient characteristics of the tones heard. In this regard the two\r\npoints most important for the student to notice are the intonation and\r\nthe tone quality.\r\n\r\nAbsolute correctness of intonation, whether in the voice or in an\r\ninstrument, can be appreciated only by the possessor of a highly\r\ncultivated sense of hearing. Many tones are accepted as being in tune\r\nwhich are heard by a very keen ear to be slightly off the pitch, or\r\nuntrue to the pitch. This matter of a tone being untrue to the pitch is\r\nof great importance to the student of music. Many instruments, when\r\nunskilfully played, give out tones of this character. The tones are\r\nimpure; instead of containing only one pitch, each note shades off into\r\npitches a trifle higher, or lower, or both. This faulty type of tone is\r\nillustrated by a piano slightly out of tune. On a single note of this\r\npiano one string may have remained in perfect tune, the second may have\r\nflatted by the merest fraction of a semitone, and the third by a\r\nslightly greater interval. When this note is played it is in one sense\r\nnot out of tune. Yet its pitch is untrue, and it shades off into a\r\nslightly flat note. In the case of many instruments, notably the flute,\r\nthe clarinet, and the French horn, unskilled performers often play notes\r\nof this character. But in these instruments the composite character of\r\nthe note is vastly more complex than in the piano. A very keen ear is\r\nrequired to appreciate fully the nature of this untrueness to the pitch.\r\nBut this is exactly the kind of ear the singer must possess, and it can\r\nbe acquired only by the experience of attentive listening.\r\n\r\nThe voice is especially liable to produce tones untrue to the pitch.\r\nStiff-throated singers almost invariably exhibit this faulty tendency.\r\nAn excessive tension of the throat hampers the vocal cords in their\r\nadjustments, and the result is an impure tone. This is more often the\r\ncause of an artist singing out of tune than a deficiency of the sense of\r\nhearing. Many singers \"sharp\" or \"flat\" habitually, and are unable to\r\novercome the habit, even though well aware of it. Only a voice entirely\r\nfree from stiffness can produce tones of absolute correctness and\r\nperfect intonation. Du Maurier hit upon a very apt description of pure\r\nintonation when he said that Trilby always sang \"right into the middle\r\nof the note.\" As an impurity of intonation is almost always an\r\nindication of throat tension, vocal teachers should be keenly sensitive\r\nto this type of faulty tone.\r\n\r\nTone quality is a subject of surpassing interest to the musician.\r\nWhatever may be thought the true purpose of music, there can be no\r\nquestion as to one demand made on each individual instrument,--it must\r\nproduce tones of sensuous beauty. A composer may delight in dissonances;\r\nbut no instrument of the orchestra may produce harsh or discordant\r\ntones. Of beauty of tone the ear is the sole judge; naturally so, for\r\nthe only appeal of the individual tone is to the ear. Melody, rhythm,\r\nand harmony may appeal to the intellect, but the quality of each\r\ncomponent tone is judged only by the ear.\r\n\r\nEach instrument has its own characteristic tone quality. The student of\r\nsinging should become familiar with the sounds of the different\r\norchestral instruments. Attention to this is extremely valuable in the\r\ntraining of the ear.\r\n\r\nBeauty of tone was seen to be the truest and best indication of the\r\ncorrect vocal action. The voice has its own tonal beauty, entirely\r\ndifferent in character from any artificial instrument. Students of\r\nsinging should listen for every fine shade of tone quality in the voices\r\nof other singers. They should learn to detect the slightest blemish on\r\nthe quality of every tone, the slightest deviation from the correct\r\npitch.\r\n\r\nAs the voice is guided by the ear, the first requirement of a singer is\r\na keen sense of hearing. For a keen ear to be of benefit, the student\r\nmust learn to listen to his own voice. This is not altogether an easy\r\nmatter. For one to learn to hear oneself justly and correctly requires\r\nconsiderable practice. The singer is placed at a natural disadvantage in\r\nlistening to himself. This is due to two causes. In the first place, the\r\ndirect muscular sensations of singing are so complex, and so\r\ndistributed about the throat and face, that the singer's attention is\r\napt to be divided between these and his auditory sensations. Second, the\r\nsound waves are conducted to the ear internally, by the vibration of the\r\nbones of the head, as well as externally, by the air waves. The\r\ninternally conveyed vibrations are a rumbling rather than a true sound;\r\nthe only true tone is the external sound, heard by the singer in the\r\nsame way as by a listener. Yet the attention is more apt to be taken up\r\nwith the internal rumbling than with the external tone. Every vocal\r\nstudent must be taught to listen to himself, to disregard the muscular\r\nsensations and the internal rumbling, and to pay attention only to the\r\nreal tones of his voice.\r\n\r\nThroat stiffness greatly increases the difficulty of listening to\r\noneself. Both the muscular sensations and the internal rumbling are\r\nheightened by the increased muscular tension. A stiff-throated singer\r\nconfounds the muscular with the auditory sensations; the feeling of\r\nmuscular effort also makes him believe his tones to be much more\r\npowerful than they really are.\r\n\r\n_The Acquirement of Skill_\r\n\r\nSkill in the use of the voice is acquired solely by practice in singing.\r\nOnly one rule is required for the conduct of vocal practice, that is,\r\nthat the voice thrives on beautiful sounds. Musical taste must always\r\nguide the vocal student in practising. The voice cannot well do more\r\nthan is demanded by the ear. If a student is unable to distinguish a\r\ncorrect intonation, his voice will not intone correctly. A student must\r\nhear and recognize his own faults or there is no possibility of his\r\ncorrecting them. He must be familiar with the characteristics of a\r\nperfect musical tone in order to demand this tone of his voice.\r\n\r\nIn the student's progress the ear always keeps slightly in advance of\r\nthe voice. Both develop together, but the ear takes the lead. The voice\r\nneeds practice to enable it to meet the demands of the ear. As this\r\npractice goes on day by day the ear in the meantime becomes keener and\r\nstill more exacting in its demands on the voice.\r\n\r\nTo train a voice is in reality a very simple matter. Nothing is required\r\nof the student but straightforward singing. Provided the student's\r\ndaily practice of singing be guided by a naturally keen ear and a sound\r\nmusical taste, the voice will steadily progress. Little need be said\r\nhere about the technical demands made on the voice in modern music. The\r\nstandards of vocal technique are well known to all vocal teachers, and\r\nindeed to musicians generally. Further, the scope of this work is\r\nlimited to the basic principle of vocal technique,--correct\r\ntone-production.\r\n\r\nFor starting the voice properly on the road to the perfect action,\r\nintelligently guided practice alone is needed. This practice must be\r\ncarried on under the direction of a competent teacher. But the teacher\r\ncannot pay attention solely to the technical training of the student's\r\nvoice. As has been seen, the training of the voice is impossible without\r\nthe cultivation of the sense of hearing; and this is dependent in great\r\nmeasure on the general musical education of the student. The teacher\r\nmust therefore direct the student's musical education as the basic\r\nprinciple of Voice Culture.\r\n\r\n_The Avoidance of Throat Stiffness_\r\n\r\nA great advance will be brought about in the profession of Voice Culture\r\nwhen vocal teachers become thoroughly familiar with the subject of\r\nthroat stiffness. This is the only troublesome feature of the training\r\nof voices. Teachers must be always on the alert to note every indication\r\nof throat stiffness. The correction of faults of production has always\r\nbeen recognized as one of the most important elements of vocal training.\r\nFaults of production are of two kinds, natural and acquired. Natural\r\nfaults are exhibited in some degree by every vocal student. These are\r\ndue solely to the lack of facility in the use of the voice and to the\r\nbeginner's want of experience in hearing his own voice. Acquired faults\r\ndevelop only as the result of unnatural throat tension. The most common\r\ncause of acquired faults of tone-production was seen in the attempt\r\nconsciously to direct the mechanical operations of the voice.\r\n\r\nEquipped with a thorough understanding of the subject of throat\r\nstiffness, the teacher is in no danger of permitting his pupils to\r\ncontract faulty habits of tone-production. Here the great value of the\r\nempirical knowledge of the voice is seen. The slightest trace of\r\nincipient throat stiffness must be immediately detected by the teacher\r\nin the sound of the pupil's tones. To correct the faulty tendency in\r\nthe beginning is comparatively simple. By listening closely to every\r\ntone sung by his pupils in the course of instruction, noting both the\r\nmusical character of the tones and the sympathetic sensations of throat\r\naction, the master will never be in doubt whether a tendency to throat\r\nstiffness is shown. In locating the natural faults of production the\r\nteacher will also find his empirical knowledge of the voice a most\r\nvaluable possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nOUTLINES OF A PRACTICAL METHOD OF VOICE CULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the accepted idea of Voice Culture, the word \"method\" is\r\ntaken to mean only the plan supposedly followed for imparting a correct\r\nmanner of tone-production. Owing to the prevalence of the mechanical\r\nidea, the acquirement of the correct vocal action has become so\r\ndifficult as to demand almost the exclusive attention of both teachers\r\nand students. Very little time is left for other subjects of vastly more\r\nimportance. Aside from the matter of tone-production, teachers do not\r\nseem to realize the importance, or even the possibility, of\r\nsystematizing a course of instruction in singing.\r\n\r\nScientific Voice Culture is inconceivable without a systematic plan of\r\nprocedure. But this is not dependent on a set of rules for imparting the\r\ncorrect vocal action. Eliminating the idea of mechanical vocal\r\nmanagement does not imply the abandonment of methodical instruction in\r\nsinging. On the contrary, Voice Culture cannot be made truly systematic\r\nso long as it is based on an erroneous and unscientific theory of vocal\r\nmanagement. A vocal teacher cannot perfect a system of instruction until\r\nhe has done with the mechanical idea. Then he will find himself to be in\r\npossession of all the materials of a sound practical method.\r\n\r\nMost important of the materials of a practical method is a comprehensive\r\nrepertoire of vocal music. Every teacher should have at his command a\r\nwide range of compositions in every form available for the voice. This\r\nshould include simple exercises, vocalises with and without words, songs\r\nof every description, arias of the lyric, dramatic, and coloratura type,\r\nand recitatives, as well as concerted numbers of every description. All\r\nthese compositions should be graded, according to the difficulties they\r\npresent, both technical in the vocal sense, and musical. For every stage\r\nof a pupil's progress the teacher should know exactly what composition\r\nto assign for study.\r\n\r\nEvery composition used in instruction, be it simple exercise or\r\nelaborate aria, should be first of all melodious. For the normally\r\ngifted student the sense of melody and the love of singing are almost\r\nsynonymous. Next to the physical endowments of voice and ear the sense\r\nof melody is the vocal student's most important gift. This feeling for\r\nmelody should be appealed to at every instant. Students should not be\r\npermitted to sing anything in a mechanical fashion. Broken scales, \"five\r\nfinger exercises,\" and mechanical drills of every kind, are altogether\r\nobjectionable. They blunt the sense of melody, and at the same time they\r\ntend to induce throat stiffness. Beauty of tone and of melody should\r\nalways be the guiding principle in the practice of singing.\r\n\r\nAll the elements of instruction,--musical education, ear training, and\r\nthe acquirement of facility in the use of the voice,--can be combined in\r\nthe singing of melodious compositions. While the teacher should know the\r\nprecise object of each study, this is not necessary for the student.\r\nHave the pupil simply sing his daily studies, with good tone and true\r\nmusical feeling, and all the rest will take care of itself.\r\n\r\nEvery vocal teacher will formulate his method of instruction according\r\nto his own taste and judgment. There will always be room for the\r\nexercise of originality, and for the working out of individual ideas.\r\nHis own experience, and his judgment in each individual case, must guide\r\nthe teacher in answering many important questions. Whether to train a\r\nvoice up or down, whether to pay special attention to enunciation, when\r\nto introduce the trill, what form of studies to use for technique and\r\nornament,--these are all matters for the teacher to decide in his own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nAbove all else the teacher should seek to make the study of singing\r\ninteresting to his pupils. This cannot be done by making the idea of\r\nmethod and of mechanical drudgery prominent. Singing is an art; both\r\nteacher and student must love their art or they cannot succeed.\r\nEverything the student is called on to do should be a distinct pleasure.\r\nTo master the piano or the violin many hours of tedious practice are\r\nrequired. Students of singing are indeed fortunate to be spared the\r\nnecessity of this tiresome work. In place of two or three hours' daily\r\npractice of scales and exercises, the vocal student need do nothing but\r\nsing good music.\r\n\r\nMuch is required of a competent vocal teacher. First of all, he must be\r\na cultured musician and a capable judge both of composition and of\r\nperformance. Further, while not necessarily a great singer, he must have\r\na thorough command of all the resources of his own voice. His\r\nunderstanding of the voice should embrace a fair knowledge of vocal\r\nphysiology and of vocal psychology. His ear should be so highly trained,\r\nand his experience in hearing singers so wide, that he possess in full\r\nthe empirical knowledge of the voice. The vocal teacher must be familiar\r\nwith the highest standards of singing. He should hear the great artists\r\nof his day and also be well versed in the traditions of his art.\r\n\r\nA highly important gift of the vocal teacher is tact. He must know how\r\nto deal with his pupils, how to smooth over the rough places of\r\ntemperament. He should be able to foster a spirit of comradeship among\r\nhis pupils, to secure the stimulating effect of rivalry, while avoiding\r\nthe evils of jealousy. Tact is an important element also in individual\r\ninstruction. Some students will demand to know the reason of everything,\r\nothers will be content to do as they are told without question. One\r\nstudent may be led to stiffen his throat by instruction which would have\r\nno such effect on another. In every case the teacher must study the\r\nindividual temperaments of his pupils and adapt his method to the\r\ncharacter of each student.\r\n\r\nPractical instruction, in its outward aspect, should be very simple. At\r\none lesson the teacher assigns certain studies and has the pupil sing\r\nthem. Now and then the teacher sings a few measures in order to give the\r\nstudent the correct idea of the effects to be obtained. If any\r\npronounced fault is shown in the student's tones, the master calls\r\nattention to the fault, perhaps imitating it, to make it more apparent\r\nto the student. In his home practice the student sings the assigned\r\nstudies, trying always to get his tones pure and true. At the next\r\nlesson the same studies are again sung, and new compositions given for\r\nfurther study.\r\n\r\nA great advantage might be gained by combining three, four, or five\r\nstudents in a class and giving lessons of an hour's time, or even an\r\nhour and a half. The students might sing in turn, all the others\r\nlistening to the one who is singing. This form of instruction would be\r\nof great service in ear training, and in acquainting the students with\r\nthe various qualities of vocal tone, both correct and faulty. Much time\r\nwould thus be saved in giving explanations and in pointing out the\r\ncharacteristics of tone to be sought or avoided. On the side of musical\r\neducation, instruction in small classes would also be found very\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nA thorough understanding of Vocal Science, including both the mechanical\r\nfeatures of tone-production and the psychological aspects of singing, is\r\nalmost indispensable to the vocal teacher. But the student of singing\r\nwill in most cases derive no benefit from this scientific knowledge.\r\nThose students who plan to become teachers must of course study Vocal\r\nScience. Yet even these students will do well to defer this study until\r\nthey have acquired a thorough mastery of their voices.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nMusical progress would seem to have taken a peculiar direction when a\r\nvoice need be raised in defense of the old art of pure singing. Several\r\nfamous writers on musical subjects would have us believe that the love\r\nof vocal melody is outgrown by one who reaches the heights of musical\r\ndevelopment. This may be true; but if so, the world has not yet\r\nprogressed so far. Music without melody may some day be written. But\r\nMozart knew naught of it, nor Beethoven, nor Wagner. Melody is still\r\nbeautiful, and never more lovely than when artistically sung by a\r\nbeautiful voice. We have not reached a point where we can afford to toss\r\nlightly aside the old art of Bel Canto.\r\n\r\nFor its future development, if not indeed for its continued existence,\r\nthe art of singing depends on an improvement in the art of training\r\nvoices. For this to be accomplished, mechanical methods must be\r\nabandoned. If this work succeeds in bringing home to the vocal\r\nprofession the error of mechanical instruction in singing, it will have\r\nserved its purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nPietro Francesco Tosi: _Observations on the Florid Song_.
