The \"handful of dates and gourd of water\"\r\nform the typical meal and daily sustenance of millions of human beings\r\nboth in Arabia and in North Africa, and to this meager diet\r\nethnologists have ascribed many of the peculiar characteristics of the\r\npeople who live upon it. Buckle, who finds in the constant consumption\r\nof rice among the Hindoos a reason for the inclination to the\r\nprodigious and grotesque, the depression of spirits, and the weariness\r\nof life manifest in that nation, likewise considers that the morbid\r\ntemperament of the Arab is a sequence of vegetarianism. He points out\r\nthat rice contains an unusual amount of starch, namely, between 83 and\r\n85 per cent; and that dates possess precisely the same nutritious\r\nsubstances as rice does, with the single difference that the starch is\r\nalready converted into sugar. To live, therefore, on such food is not\r\nto satisfy hunger; and hunger, like all other cravings, even if\r\npartially satisfied, exercises control over the imagination. \"This\r\nbiological fact,\" says Peschel, \"was and still is the origin of the\r\nrigid fastings prescribed by religions so widely different, which are\r\nmade use of by Shamans in every quarter of the world when they wish to\r\nenter into communication with invisible powers.\" Peschel and Buckle,\r\nhowever, are at variance as to the influence of the date diet as\r\naffecting a race; and the former remarks that, \"while no one will deny\r\nthat the nature of the food reacts upon the mental powers of man, the\r\ntemperament evoked by different sorts is different;\" yet \"we are still\r\nfar from having ascertained anything in regard to the permanent\r\neffects of daily food, especially as the human stomach has, to a great\r\ndegree, the power of accommodating itself to various food substances,\r\nso that with use even narcotics lose much of their effect.\" The same\r\nauthor also adds that the date \"trains up independent and warlike\r\ndesert tribes, which have not the most remote mental relationship to\r\nthe rice-eating Hindoos.\"\r\n\r\nIt remains for the reader to reconcile this disagreement of learned\r\ndoctors according to his own judgment. The evidence of those who\r\nsubsist on the date is certainly overwhelming in its favor. The\r\nAssyrians, tradition says, asserted that it was such a great gift to\r\nthem that its worth could not be too extravagantly told; for they had\r\nfound, for the leaves, the fruit, the juices, and the wood of the\r\ntree, three hundred and sixty different uses. The Mohammedans adopt\r\nthe date palm into their religion as an emblem of uprightness, and say\r\nthat it miraculously sprang into existence, fully grown, at the\r\ncommand of the Prophet. Palm branches still enter as symbols of\r\nrejoicing into Christian religious ceremonies; and throughout\r\nPalestine constant reference is found to the date and the palm in the\r\nnaming of towns. Bethany means \"a house of dates.\" Ancient Palmyra was\r\na \"city of palms,\" and the Hebrew female name Tamar is derived from\r\nthe word in that language signifying palm. In Africa there is an\r\nimmense tract of land between Barbary and the great desert named\r\nBilidulgerid, \"the land of dates,\" from the profusion of the trees\r\nthere growing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATHERING DATES IN CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nIn this country, the date as an article of food is classed with the\r\nprune, the fig, and the tamarind, to be used merely as a luxury. We\r\nfind it coming to the markets at just about this time of year in the\r\ngreatest quantities, packed in baskets roughly made from dried palm\r\nleaves. The dates, gathered while ripe and soft, are forced into these\r\nreceptacles until almost a pasty mass, often not over clean, is\r\nformed. Their natural sugar tends to preserve them; but after long\r\nkeeping they become dry and hard. This renders them unfit for use; but\r\nthey still find a sale to the itinerant vendors who, after steaming\r\nthem to render them soft (of course at the expense of the flavor),\r\nhawk them about the streets. Dates in the pasty condition are not\r\nrelished by those who live on them; nor, on the other hand, would we\r\nprobably fancy the dried, almost tasteless fruit which, strung on long\r\nstraws, is carried in bunches by the Arabs in their pouches.\r\n\r\nThe date palm (_phoenix dactylifera_) is the most important species\r\nof the dozen which make up its genus. Though slow in growth, it\r\nshoots up a magnificent stem, to the height sometimes of eighty feet,\r\nthe summit of which is covered with a graceful crown of pinnated\r\nleaves. The trunk is exceedingly rough and spiny; the flower spathes,\r\nwhich appear in the axils of the leaves, are woody, and contain\r\nbranched spadices with many flowers; more than 11,000 have been\r\ncounted on a single male spadix. As the flowers are dioecious, it is\r\nnecessary to impregnate the female blossoms artificially in order to\r\ninsure a good crop; and to this end the male spadices are cut off when\r\nthe pollen is ripe and carefully shaken over the female ones. At from\r\nsix to ten years of age, the tree bears, and then remains fruitful for\r\nupward of 200 years. An excellent idea of the palm in full bearing may\r\nbe obtained from our illustration, which represents the mode of\r\ngathering the dates, of which a single tree will often yield from one\r\nto four hundredweight in a season. The fruit varies much in size and\r\nquality; and in the oases of the Sahara forty-six varieties have been\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe utilizations of the date palm and its products are very numerous.\r\nThe stem yields starch, and timber for houses, boats, fences, fuel,\r\netc., as well as an inferior kind of sago. The leaves serve as\r\nparasols and umbrellas, and for material for roof covering, baskets,\r\nbrushes, mats, and innumerable utensils. At their base is a fiber,\r\nwhich is spun into excellent rope. When the heart of the leaf is cut,\r\na thick honey-like juice exudes, which, by fermentation, becomes wine\r\n(the \"toddy\" of India), or vinegar, and is also boiled down into\r\nsugar. The young shoots, when cooked, resemble asparagus; and the\r\ndates themselves are dried and ground into meal, from which bread is\r\nprepared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPANTHERS AS SEED DISTRIBUTORS.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that bees carry pollen from flower to flower, and\r\nthat eggs of marine animals are often carried long distances in the\r\nstomachs of aquatic birds. A very curious instance of this kind,\r\nshowing how vegetable species may be diffused by means which no\r\nbotanist, however acute, would be likely to think of, is mentioned by\r\nMr. Alfred Smee, who states that, attached to the skin of a panther\r\nrecently shot in India, were found numerous seeds, each of which had\r\ntwo perfect hooks, manifestly designed to attach themselves to foreign\r\nbodies. As the panther moved about it collected the seeds on the skin\r\nand carried them about wherever it went; but when it rubbed against\r\nthe shrubs, it of necessity brushed some off, and thus distributed\r\nthem. One of the seeds produced a handsome plant, and beautiful\r\nclusters of tubular flowers. It was immediately recognized to be the\r\n_Martynia diandra_--a plant which, although introduced into England as\r\nfar back as 1731, has scarcely ever been cultivated, although it has\r\nbeen commented on by botanists and other writers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR POSTERITY--A SUGGESTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Irish gentleman who declined to aid an enterprise for the benefit\r\nof posterity, remarking that posterity had never done anything for\r\nhim, was, after all the sport made of him, no unfair representative of\r\nthe bulk of mankind. There is talk enough about doing great things for\r\nthe advantage of future ages, but the real motive is apt to be\r\nsomething very different. To perpetuate their own name or fame, men or\r\nnations often set up lasting monuments, and sometimes unintentionally\r\nconvey thereby to after times a few more or less instructive\r\nindications of the artistic or industrial skill of their day and\r\ngeneration. To further their own immediate ends, or to secure some\r\nbenefit to their immediate descendants, men frequently undertake great\r\nmaterial enterprises, and sometimes the work so done remains for ages\r\nthe source of perennial good. But very rarely, if ever, can it be said\r\nthat any work of man was undertaken solely, or even chiefly, for the\r\nbenefit of posterity--more rarely still, for remote posterity.\r\n\r\nHence it happens that we owe far more to accident, to fire, rapine,\r\nvolcanic outbursts, and the protecting care of desolation, for the\r\nknowledge we have of times long past, than to any intentional legacies\r\nof art or learning left us by the men of those times. The lost and\r\nabandoned tools, weapons, and ornaments of the stone age are all that\r\nwe have to tell us of the childhood of humanity. Had no fiery\r\ndisasters ever overtaken the pile-dwellers of the Swiss lakes, we\r\nshould probably have never heard of such a people.\r\n\r\nTo the mud and ashes of Vesuvius, rather than to the historians of the\r\nRoman Empire, we owe the best of our knowledge of how Roman cities\r\nlooked and Roman citizens lived eighteen hundred years ago. In the\r\nfragments of a _terra cotta_ library, buried in the ruins of a royal\r\npalace, we find almost our only records of the arts and sciences of\r\nancient Assyria. Under the ash heaps of a forgotten age, in Cyprus,\r\nCesnola finds the only known vestiges of a primitive civilization,\r\nreaching far back into the domain of mythology. Thanks to the\r\ndestroyers of Troy and Mycenæ, and the protective care of temporary\r\noblivion, Schliemann is now able to verify tradition and lay before an\r\nastonished and delighted world numerous precious relics of heroic ages\r\nhitherto remembered only in song.\r\n\r\nWho can estimate the value of these and similar findings to us--the\r\nvalue of the revelations they bring of man's condition in those remote\r\nages? Who can say how many or how few the ages will be ere the time\r\ncomes when the antiquaries of the future will be rejoicing over\r\nequally fragmentary vestiges of the doings and possessions of our day?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, who can estimate the value of the knowledge lost\r\nbeyond hope of recovery, or the checks to human progress experienced,\r\nin the repeated wiping out, so to speak, of the higher races and the\r\ncivilizations they embodied? And who can say that similar disasters\r\nmay not come again and again to humanity?\r\n\r\nSuppose a pestilence peculiarly fatal to the white race should fall\r\nupon the world to-day, crippling, perhaps exterminating, the now\r\ndominant civilized nations; how long would the material elements of\r\nour science and art or general culture remain with power to enlighten\r\nthe barbarous tribes that would inherit the earth? Human progress has\r\nmore than once been set back for centuries by such natural or\r\nunnatural causes, leaving the sites of once splendid civilizations to\r\nbe overrun with barbaric hordes knowing nothing of the better times\r\nthat went before.\r\n\r\nSuppose, again, that, by one of those geologic changes so numerous in\r\nthe history of our unstable globe, the existing continents should sink\r\na thousand feet. Every center of modern civilization would be\r\nsubmerged. The great social and political organizations of humanity\r\nwould be broken up, and in the wreck of nations that would ensue very\r\nlittle of the glory and culture of the race could survive. The earth\r\nis dotted with vestiges of lost and forgotten empires. Can we\r\nreasonably assume, in the face of such facts, that the nations of\r\nto-day are immortal?\r\n\r\nThe question is: Shall we continue to trust to chance, as all other\r\ncivilizations have, for the preservation of the conquests we have made\r\namong the forces and secrets of nature; or shall we do something\r\npositive for posterity, and leave the ages to come some certain and\r\nabiding legacy of our treasures of art and learning?\r\n\r\nIt may be that human progress will go on and on to the end of time\r\nwithout a break; that in the course of centuries mankind will surpass\r\nus in civilization, knowledge and power, as much as we surpass the\r\nearliest and rudest men we have yet found traces of: maybe infinitely\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn such a case, what would not the scholars of, say the year 5000\r\nA.D., or any other future age, be willing to give for a comprehensive\r\npicture of humanity as it exists to-day--for a reasonably complete\r\nlibrary of our literature, science, and art? We may safely assume\r\nthat nothing of the sort will be possible if matters are left to take\r\ntheir natural course. By that time every structure, every machine,\r\nevery book, every work of art, now in use or stored away in our\r\nlibraries and galleries of art, will have disappeared, a prey to time,\r\nthe elements, or the more destructive violence of man.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be that, through repeated disasters of one\r\nsort or another, mankind, three thousand years hence, will have lost\r\nall the knowledge men ever possessed, and be slowly struggling upward\r\nfor the hundredth time from inherited barbarism. In such a case, what\r\nenormous benefits might not accrue to man from a fortunate opening up\r\nof the wealth of knowledge we possess!\r\n\r\nIn any supposable case between these extremes of progress or\r\ndegradation, a legacy of art and learning, such as we might easily set\r\napart for remote posterity, would certainly be acceptable, perhaps\r\nextremely useful. Besides, it might be possible for us to set such a\r\nworthy example to those who shall come after us that, come what might,\r\nhumanity would never be left absolutely void of the means of\r\ninstruction, nor any worthy human achievement be absolutely lost or\r\nforgotten. The experience of these later years has demonstrated the\r\nvalue of such legacies even when unintentional, unselected, and\r\nwretchedly fragmentary. It has made clear also how a legacy\r\ndeliberately made may be indefinitely preserved.\r\n\r\nRoughly outlined, the carrying out of such a truly philanthropic\r\nenterprise would involve nothing more difficult than--\r\n\r\n_First_. The construction of a practically indestructible treasure\r\nchamber in some secure place; and\r\n\r\n_Second_. The preparation of a library well calculated to withstand\r\nthe corroding tooth of time.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of structures would meet the first demand--massive pyramids\r\nof covered earth or of solid masonry, or chambers hewn from the heart\r\nof some granitic hill. In low latitudes, where glacial action is not\r\nto be feared, the pyramidal form might be preferable: in more northern\r\nregions the rock-cut chamber would probably be at once cheaper and\r\nmore durable. In either case, an elevated site should be chosen as a\r\nsafeguard against submergence.\r\n\r\nTo secure the permanence of the records would be more difficult.\r\nOrdinary books and papers would clearly be unsuitable for long\r\nkeeping; though for comparatively limited periods they might answer if\r\nsecurely packed in airtight waterproof cases. Nothing liable to\r\nspontaneous decay should be admitted. Stereotype plates of metal would\r\nbe even more open to objection than printed sheets. The noble metals\r\nwould be too costly, the baser would corrode; and with either the\r\nvalue of the plates as metal would be a standing danger to the\r\ndeposit. The material basis of the library must be, as nearly as\r\npossible, worthless for other uses (to insure them against the natural\r\ngreed of man), yet such as will hold the records sharply and\r\nfaithfully under all circumstances. The _terra cotta_ tablets of\r\nancient Assyria are instructive in this connection. Possibly plates of\r\nartificial stone, or sheets of a _papier-maché_-like preparation of\r\nasbestos, might be less bulky and equally durable.\r\n\r\nHaving determined this point, and dug from the solid rock a chamber\r\nfor the reception of our legacy, the next step would be the selection\r\nof its contents. Obviously the books to be preserved should embrace\r\nfirst of all lexicons and grammars of every known form of speech,\r\nsince it is impossible to tell which of the dialects of to-day will be\r\nthe parents of the dominant tongue of any distant future time; while\r\nwe may be practically certain that some one or more of the languages\r\nof to-day will furnish a key to any language that men will ever use.\r\nNext in order would come encyclopædias, the most comprehensive and\r\ncomplete that there might be room for. The sacred books of all nations\r\nmight come next; then the works of the great poets, historians and\r\nnovelists; after them, the best obtainable records of art, science,\r\nthe various industries, and so on, with specimens of the best and most\r\ntypical of our works of art, manufacture, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe spaces between the various articles should be filled in with some\r\ninsoluble and neutral substance, to prevent corrosion, or the\r\ninfiltration of water and consequent damage to the plates. Then, the\r\nentrance to the chamber being securely sealed, permanent records\r\nshould be made in many places and in various ways, setting forth the\r\npurpose of the deposit, its exact location, and the nature of its\r\ncontents. Among such records not the least valuable would be deeply\r\ncut polyglot inscriptions on natural cliffs in different parts of the\r\nworld, observation having shown that such records may remain to\r\nchallenge human curiosity for ages after all other records of their\r\ntime have disappeared.\r\n\r\nEven a single deposit of this sort might prove of enormous value to\r\nthe race at some critical period of its history. But the probability\r\nis that the good work would not end with one deposit. From age to age\r\nthis and other nations might repeat the experiment, commemorating in\r\nthis way important epochs in their history. The fashion once set might\r\neasily become a permanent feature of all great national celebrations.\r\nThe cost would be comparatively small: a penny contribution from each\r\nof the visitors to the Philadelphia Exhibition, for example, would\r\nhave been quite sufficient to provide for a memorial of our first\r\nCentennial year that would have carried an imperishable picture of the\r\ncivilization of the day to the end of--our first millennium, at least;\r\nand we may safely infer that, whatever may be the condition of the\r\nworld at that not very remote epoch, a memorial of that sort would be\r\nsomething worth having.\r\n\r\nAs we have intimated, the custom might easily become general, so that\r\nin the course of ages the earth would become dotted with such\r\nrepositories of art and learning. Then, come what might to\r\nhumanity--whatever might be the ups and downs of nations--whatever\r\nmoral, social, or intellectual advances mankind might make--whatever\r\nlapses or disasters might befall them--it could hardly happen that a\r\nknowledge of any considerable period of human history, or the\r\nadvantage of any worthy human achievement, could ever be permanently\r\nblotted out and lost.\r\n\r\nIt is true that \"posterity\" has never done anything of the sort for\r\nus. It is true that \"posterity\" may have no valid claim on us for such\r\na legacy. But we might venture to make \"posterity\" a present! It would\r\nnot cost us much, and it might turn out to be immensely valuable and\r\nuseful to some far future age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOST ARTS IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the objects of ancient art contained in the Castellani\r\ncollection, recently placed on exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum\r\nof Art in this city, are individually of great rarity and\r\narchæological value, they derive additional importance from the fact\r\nthat, viewed conjunctively as a collection, they represent connected\r\nhistories of two great industrial arts extending over many centuries.\r\nBoth in the work of the goldsmith and of the potter, we are enabled to\r\ntrace progress from the earliest stages up to a period when the\r\ngreatest skill was attained, and even subsequently into the era of\r\ndecadence. In both industries, we find that ancient and mediæval\r\nworkmen possessed knowledge which we do not possess; and among Signor\r\nCastellani's treasures may be seen handiwork which is the embodiment\r\nof two lost arts, the secrets of which the modern world, with all its\r\ninfinitely superior wisdom, has not yet rediscovered.\r\n\r\nThe productions, in the Castellani collection, of precious metal\r\nworkers dating from prehistoric epochs, the exact dates of which are\r\nwholly unknown, and covering the long period ending in the thirteenth\r\ncentury, are represented by the contents of some twenty cases. The\r\nfirst three of these receptacles bear no dates. The ornaments which\r\nthey contain are of bronze, amber, silver, and glass (the latter\r\nhaving become converted into opalescent silicic acid), and were found\r\nin Præneste (modern Palestrina, Italy), and in the territory which was\r\nancient Etruria. Case No. 4 bears date 700 B.C., and here is a rich\r\ntreasure of primitive Etruscan and Phoenician ornaments of gold,\r\nadorned with granulated work. Signor Castellani considers that the\r\nworkmanship of these objects is so perfect that it is impossible at\r\nthe present time to explain the process of execution, and very\r\ndifficult to imitate it. The ornaments are of two kinds--those for\r\nordinary use and those for funereal purposes. The first are massive,\r\nand might be worn for years without injury; the others are extremely\r\ndelicate. All are made of the purest gold, and their decoration\r\nevinces the most consummate skill and taste on the part of the artist.\r\nThere is, for example, a small flask, shaped something like an antique\r\nwine jar, and about five inches in height. It is of beaten gold, and\r\nis covered with a pattern intended to imitate the similarly shaped\r\ndesigns of variegated glass of the Græco-Phoenician period. This\r\npattern is entirely produced by minute globules of metal soldered to\r\nthe surface in tiers of zigzag or Vandyke patterns. Another specimen\r\nis a strip of gold covered with granulated lines and bearing a row of\r\nbirds in relief. On other ornaments are exquisitely carved heads and\r\nflowers, produced apparently by hammering on the reverse of the\r\nobject, but with a delicacy and precision of touch which is simply\r\nmarvelous.\r\n\r\nThe closest students of this ancient handiwork are entirely at a loss\r\nto understand how the processes of melting, soldering, and wire\r\ndrawing, which were employed in the art, were performed. Modern\r\nworkmen have failed in their attempts exactly to imitate the old\r\nornaments; and it is certain that the secret of the mechanical agents,\r\nwhereby it was possible to separate and join pieces of gold hardly\r\nperceptible to the naked eye, is lost. Signor Castellani has taken\r\ngreat pains to solve the problem, reading all the treatises of\r\nmediæval goldsmiths, inquiring of all classes of Italian jewelers, and\r\nexperimenting with all kinds of chemicals, in the hope of finding the\r\nsolder wherewith the minute grains were attached to the surface of the\r\nmetal. At last he found some of the old processes still employed in a\r\nremote district, hidden in the recesses of the Apennines, far from the\r\ngreat towns. Bringing away a few workmen, he gave them much more\r\ninstruction, and at last succeeded, not perhaps in equalling, but\r\ncertainly in rivalling the ancient productions.\r\n\r\nWe question whether the Etruscans used fire at all in their soldering,\r\nas it would be almost an impossibility to keep the excessively fine\r\ntools necessary for the work at a proper heat. Mr. Joshua Rose offers\r\nthe plausible suggestion that a cold flux was employed, with which the\r\nworkman followed the lines or dots of his pattern. Then the gold\r\ngranules were possibly sprinkled over the surface, and adhered only to\r\nthe solder, the superfluous grains being brushed off after the solder\r\nhad set.\r\n\r\nThere is also a fragment of a finely woven fabric, made of threads of\r\npure gold, found on the body of a woman in a tomb at Metapontum. This\r\nis without doubt the material to which the Psalmist refers in speaking\r\nof \"the King's daughter\" having \"clothing of wrought gold;\" and in the\r\nPentateuch there is reference to gold threads being used upon looms.\r\n\r\nAs we follow the various objects in the twenty cases above mentioned,\r\nthe decline of the goldworker's art when the use of enamels came into\r\nvogue is evidenced. Continuing on to later periods, the decadence is\r\nmore marked under the successors of Alexander. In Rome, under the\r\nemperors, we find gold used as a mere setting for precious stones, and\r\nfinally the collection terminates with examples of workmanship of the\r\ntime of Charlemagne, when the workmen had lost their cunning, and the\r\nnoble metal had been altogether debased to secondary uses.\r\n\r\nThe second instance where a lost art is exemplified in Signor\r\nCastellani's collection is in the glazing of the Gubbio majolica. We\r\nhave not space here to review the magnificent series of ancient\r\nspecimens of pottery in detail; and thus it will suffice to say that,\r\nbeginning with some of the earliest pieces made by the Arabs when they\r\noccupied Sicily, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century, the\r\ncollection presents examples of all the finest types of later mediæval\r\nart. Gubbio, where the peculiar kind of majolica above noted was made,\r\nis a small town once in the territory of the dukes of Urbino; and in\r\nthe sixteenth century it became famous for its pottery. This was\r\nattributable to the talent of one man, Giorgio Andreoli, who is\r\nreputed to have invented the wonderful luster characteristic of the\r\nGubbio ware. The body of majolica is mere common clay; and after the\r\npiece is finished on the wheel, it is dried and burnt in a furnace.\r\nAfter the biscuit thus prepared has been dipped in the glaze, the\r\ncolors are applied on the soft surface of the latter, and the\r\nvitrifying process fuses all into a glossy enamel of the color of the\r\npigment. This is still the common practice; and we mention it merely\r\nto show that to his pigment and glaze Andreoli must have added some\r\nthird substance, which rendered the enamel capable of reflecting white\r\nlight as blue, red, green, or yellow light--in other words, of giving\r\nthe object a luster of a color wholly different from the tints of the\r\npigment. He evidently could produce any desired color at will, and the\r\neffects gained are indescribably beautiful. The Castellani collection\r\ncontains 130 superb specimens, which glow like jewels. In one, the\r\nscene of the nativity of Christ is provided with the figures in low\r\nrelief, and the exquisite cerulean lustre is imparted to give the\r\neffect of moonlight. The rarest pieces are those of which the luster\r\nis a delicate green. Some blaze with yellow, as if of gold; others\r\nexhibit the brilliancy of the ruby; while others resemble the interior\r\nof the pearl oyster shell. Whether this sheen is produced by\r\npolarization of the light in some manner, or whether it is at all\r\nanalogous to fluorescence, is yet to be decided. The impression of the\r\nsurface with fine microscopic lines might produce an iridescence, but\r\nnot separate and clearly defined hues. The ware was intended for\r\nornamental purposes, not for household use; and it was suspended\r\nagainst the rich, dark tapestries of the period with which walls were\r\ncovered, thus aiding, as it were, in illuminating the apartment with\r\nits exquisite radiance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE GLASS DECEPTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 26, 1871, General A.J. Pleasonton, of Philadelphia, Pa.,\r\nobtained a patent for \"utilizing the natural light of the sun\r\ntransmitted through clear glass, and the blue or electric(!) solar\r\nrays transmitted through blue, purple, or violet colored glass, or its\r\nequivalent, in the propagation and growth of plants and animals.\" In\r\nhis specification, of which the above constitutes one claim, he states\r\nthat he has discovered \"special and specific efficacy in the use of\r\nthis combination of the caloric rays of the sun and the electric blue\r\nlight in stimulating the glands of the body, the nervous system\r\ngenerally, and the secretive organs of man and animals.\" He also\r\nstates that he finds that vegetation is vastly improved by the\r\ntransmitted blue light. These alleged re-discoveries--for the General\r\nonly claims to have devised the method of utilizing them--were\r\nextensively promulgated through the press early in 1871. Subsequently,\r\nin 1876, General Pleasonton published a book on the subject, the\r\nvolume being appropriately bound in blue and printed in blue ink.\r\nRecently public attention has again been called to the subject by a\r\nNew York daily journal. The peculiar kind of glass in question is\r\nknown as \"pot metal blue,\" that is, it is stained a bluish violet\r\nthroughout, and is not clear glass covered with flashings of blue\r\nglass. It is used in greenhouses, etc., in connection with clear\r\nglass; and in General Pleasonton's grapery it appears that only every\r\neighth row of panes was blue. Some of the results alleged to have been\r\nobtained by exposing animals and plants are as follows: Twenty grape\r\nvines, in their second year, after being set out under the blue glass,\r\nbore 1,200 lbs. of splendid fruit. A very weak Alderney bull calf was\r\nin four months developed into a strong and vigorous bull. Heifers when\r\nkept under blue glass may safely bear young when 18 months old. A weak\r\nchild, weighing but 3½ lbs. at birth, weighed at the end of four\r\nmonths 22 lbs.--the light in this instance having come through blue\r\ncurtains. Two major-generals with rheumatism were cured in three days.\r\nA young lady whose hair had come out regained her tresses; and to\r\nthese must be added various other cures of severe ailments which we\r\nhave not space here to recapitulate. The above are the alleged facts;\r\nand we propose to consider the supposed discovery in the light of\r\nprevious investigations.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the theories of electricity, etc., advanced by\r\nGeneral Pleasonton to account for his phenomena, their absurdity is so\r\ncomplete that we shall waste no time over them. The important question\r\nin the matter, and the only one in which the public is interested, is\r\nwhether or not blue glass is capable of producing all or any of the\r\nresults imputed to its use. In order to clear the way for the\r\nexamination of the investigations, the records of which we have\r\ncarefully collected, let us consider first those which General\r\nPleasonton quotes in support of his views. These are (1) Seunebier's\r\nresearches, which go to show that the blue and violet rays are the\r\nmost active in determining the decomposition of carbonic acid in\r\nplants, and (2) experiments of Dr. Morichini, repeated by Carpa and\r\nRidolfi, proving that violet rays magnetized a small needle. The first\r\nstatement has been totally disproved. Dr. Von Bezold, in his recent\r\nwork on color, states that \"the chemical processes in plants, as far\r\nas they are dependent upon light, are principally caused by the rays\r\nof medium and of lower refrangibility. The development of the green\r\ncolor of the chlorophyll, the decomposition of carbonic acid, as well\r\nas the formation of starch, etc., in the grains of the chlorophyll,\r\nare induced by the red, green, and orange rays.\" The blue, violet, and\r\nultra violet rays, the same authority goes onto explain, influence\r\n\"the rapidity of growth, compel the so-called zoöspores to move in\r\ncertain directions, and alter the positions of leaves, etc.\" In\r\nconfirmation of this, we have Sach's experiments in 1872, which show\r\nthat light, transmitted through the yellow solution of potassium\r\nchromate, enables green leaves to decompose over 88 per cent. of\r\ncarbonic acid; while that passed through blue ammonia copper oxide\r\ndecomposes less than 8 per cent. This proves the superiority of the\r\nyellow ray to decompose carbonic acid; and this fact Professor J.W.\r\nDraper discovered a long time ago by the direct use of the spectrum.\r\nIn still further confirmation, we may cite the investigations of\r\nVogel, Pfeiffer, Selim, and Placentim. The last three have conducted\r\nresearches in full knowledge of those of General Pleasonton, and their\r\nexperiments show that yellow rays are more promotive of the evolution\r\nof carbon in animals and its absorption in plants than any others in\r\nthe spectrum, the violet rays having least power in these respects,\r\nwith the exception of the red rays in the case of animals. The\r\nabsorption of carbonic acid by plants, and its evolution by animals,\r\nwe hardly need add, are prime essentials to the growth and health of\r\neach. The notion that light possesses a magnetizing power on steel was\r\nupset by Niepce de St. Victor in 1861. After removing every source of\r\nerror, he \"found it impossible to make one sewing needle, solarized\r\nfor a very long time under the rays of light concentrated by a strong\r\nlens, attract another suspended by a hair, whether the light was white\r\nor colored by being made to pass through a violet-colored glass.\"\r\n\r\nWe can proceed further and even show that violet light is in some\r\nrespects hurtful to plants. Cailletet, for example, says in 1868 that\r\n\"light which was passed through a solution of iodine in carbonic\r\ndisulphide prevents decomposition altogether.\" Baudrimont says that\r\n\"no colored light permits vegetables to go through all the phases of\r\ntheir evolutions. Violet-colored light is positively injurious to\r\nplants; they absolutely require white light.\" This scientist\r\ninstituted the most elaborate experiments on the subject, ranging over\r\n11 years, from 1850 to 1861; and the result of all his labor may be\r\nsummed up in the simple statement that no illumination which human\r\ningenuity can devise is so well adapted for promoting natural\r\nprocesses as the pure white light provided by the Creator. So much by\r\nway of general denial of the claims of superior efficacy residing in\r\nblue light of any kind.\r\n\r\nNow we have yet to examine the peculiar variety of blue light here\r\nused. Sunlight can, by means of the prism, be split into colored rays,\r\nany one of which we may isolate, and so obtain a certain colored\r\nlight. Similarly we may obtain light of a desired color by the use of\r\na colored glass which will stop out the rays not of the hue required.\r\nSo that we may obtain violet light from the spectrum or by filtering\r\nsunlight through violet glass. When, however, Dr. Von Bezold, as\r\nabove, asserts that the violet rays have such and such an effect, he\r\nmeans the violet of the spectrum, which has its specific duty to\r\nperform in the compound light of which it is a necessary portion. But\r\nthe violet light of the spectrum and filtered violet sunlight are\r\naltogether different things. The first, as our valued contributor Dr.\r\nVan der Weyde has very clearly pointed out, is \"a homogeneous color\r\ncontaining, besides the luminous, the invisible chemical rays without\r\nany caloric rays; while the light colored by passing through violet\r\nglass is a mixture of blue rays with the red rays at the other end of\r\nthe spectrum; and it contains a quantity of the chemical rays\r\nbelonging to the blue and the caloric rays belonging to the red. In\r\nfact, violet glass passes a light identical with sunlight, only much\r\nreduced in power, containing but a portion of its caloric, chemical,\r\nand luminous agency: being simply deprived of its strongest rays.\" And\r\nthis the spectroscope has clearly demonstrated. Reduced to its\r\nsimplest terms, then, the necessary conclusion is that the violet\r\nglass acts purely as a shade for decreasing the intensity of the solar\r\nlight. And in the simple fact that it does so serve as a shade lies\r\nthe sole virtue (if any there be) of the glass. In 1856, Dr. Daubeny\r\nmade experiments on the germination of seeds, and in his report is\r\nthis suggestive sentence: \"In a south aspect, indeed, light which had\r\npassed through the ammonia sulphate of copper (blue solution), and\r\neven darkness itself, seemed more favorable than the whole of the\r\nspectrum; but this law did not seem to extend to the case of seeds\r\nplaced in a northern aspect where the total amount of light was less\r\nconsiderable.\"\r\n\r\nIn our next issue, we shall review the effects of light and darkness\r\nupon the animal organization, and endeavor to account for the curing\r\nof diseases and the production of other phenomena which have been\r\nerroneously ascribed to the influence of the blue filtered sunlight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WETLI MOUNTAIN RAILROAD AND ITS DISASTROUS TRIAL TRIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various means proposed of late years for building lines of\r\nrailroad on the steep slopes of mountains, that of M. Wetli, of\r\nZurich, Switzerland, has attracted considerable attention from\r\nEuropean engineers. We have already laid before our readers the system\r\nof central toothed rails used on the Righi and other mountain roads in\r\nEurope. In the Wetli system, instead of this rail and the pinion on\r\nthe vehicle engaging it, there is a drum having a helicoidal thread\r\nwhich engages with triangular rails. This drum is attached to the\r\nlocomotive. The construction will be readily understood from the\r\nillustrations given herewith, which we take from _La Nature_. The\r\nthread on the drum is precisely that which would be formed could a\r\nrail similar to one of the central angular rails be wrapped around it;\r\nso that it always is in contact with the mid rails, and necessarily\r\nprevents any bodily sliding or rolling of the vehicles over the\r\nregular track when the drum is held motionless. The V-shaped mid rails\r\nare securely fastened to horizontal iron ties, which rest on wooden\r\ntraverses. The angle of the V is 50°; the distance between any two\r\ntraverses is 2.8 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--THE WETLI MOUNTAIN RAILROAD.]\r\n\r\nThe locomotive has three coupled axles, on the mid one of which the\r\ndrum is attached so as to be raised or lowered to engage the rails at\r\nthe will of the engineer: it being possible to cause it to act on the\r\nrails with a pressure of 3.7 tons. The diameter of the drum is 2.14\r\nfeet. Its spiral thread is of steel, very solidly attached, and so\r\nmade as to grip the rails to a distance of 0.6 inch below the level of\r\nthe track. In order to insure this contact, on the drum axle are two\r\npulleys which run on the exterior road, and of which the diameter\r\ndetermines the depth of the hold of the threads. These pulleys are\r\n34.7 inches in diameter, while the driving wheels are very slightly in\r\nexcess, to provide for the use of tyres.\r\n\r\nM. Wetli's invention, as we have described it, was placed between\r\nWoedensweil and Einsiedlen, Switzerland. The difference in altitude\r\nbetween these points is 1,513 feet, the distance 9.6 miles. The grade\r\nis from 4 to 5 per cent over the first six miles of the way, and\r\nsubsequently decreases to 1 per cent. The Wetli railroad was\r\nestablished last October only on the heavy grade, that is, the first\r\nsix miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nEarly in November, trial trips were made which did not prove\r\nsatisfactory. Sometimes the drum thread gripped the triangular rails\r\nproperly and acted well; again it would wedge itself upon them, and\r\noften would simply roll over their tops without engaging at all. After\r\nthe first trials, during which very many of the rails were broken, M.\r\nWelti re-adjusted the drum thread. Finally, he concluded that he had\r\novercome all difficulties in his apparatus; and accordingly a formal\r\ntrial was arranged on November 30. For about four and a half miles of\r\nthe ascent the drum worked well; and the hoarfrost, with which the\r\nrails were thickly covered, showed good contact. Afterward it worked\r\nirregularly; but the station of Schindelleghi, a distance of five\r\nmiles, was reached without accident, the locomotive dragging a car\r\nloaded with 20 tons of rails. It was then attempted to make the\r\ndescent by the aid of the helicoidal drum; but this jumped the rails,\r\nand broke them almost immediately. By the aid of back pressure of\r\nsteam and brakes, the locomotive was stopped. Then, unfortunately, the\r\nengine was started again; but hardly had the descent been resumed when\r\nit was evident that the drum was not holding, and that the speed was\r\naccelerating rapidly. Brakes and steam were both found useless, and\r\nthe engine went tearing over the rails at the rate of a mile a minute.\r\nOf the fourteen persons in the vehicles, three were thrown out and\r\nkilled, and the rest were more or less seriously injured. The heavily\r\nloaded car left the track, and tore up both central and side rails\r\nuntil its coupling broke. The engineer, with great intrepidity, clung\r\nto his engine, coolly giving signals to open switches so that the\r\nlocomotive might run upon the level track and so expend its momentum;\r\nbut the engine left the rails at a sharp curve, destroyed the track\r\nfor about a hundred feet, and finally stopped a mass of ruins, with\r\nits brave engineer mortally wounded. Whether the Wetli system can be\r\nmade to work as intended by the inventor is regarded as doubtful by\r\nthe engineers who have examined into the causes of the disaster.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGHORN HENS.\r\n\r\nIf a man keeps Leghorns he must have no garden, or he must cover the\r\ntop of his hen yards. That Leghorns are great layers and active hens,\r\nthere can be no denying, but they are great flyers. We have built our\r\nyard a lath and a half high, says the _Poultry Review_, but what do\r\nthese saucy things care for that? Although they have the whole outside\r\nworld to range in, yet the garden seems to have a greater attraction\r\nthan all the rest. The other day we found it necessary to feed a weak\r\nchicken in the garden by itself, so that it might be sure of its\r\nshare. A few minutes afterwards, on looking out of the window, we\r\ndiscovered the weak chicken in the henyard and two Leghorn hens\r\nfinishing up its food. We went out, but the two robbers had fled.\r\nGoing around the corner, we found them rolling in a flower bed. A\r\nLeghorn will do as much mischief in a garden in five minutes as\r\nanything we know of.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSAWDUST IN ROUGH CASTING.\r\n\r\nSiehr recommends very highly the use of sawdust in mortar as superior\r\neven to hair for the prevention of cracking and subsequent peeling off\r\nof rough casting under the action of storms and frost. His own house,\r\nexposed to prolonged storms on the seacoast, had patches of mortar to\r\nbe renewed each spring, and after trying without effect a number of\r\nsubstances to prevent it, he found sawdust perfectly satisfactory. It\r\nwas first thoroughly dried and sifted through an ordinary grain sieve\r\nto remove the larger particles. The mortar was made by mixing 1 part\r\ncement, 2 lime, 2 sawdust, and 5 sharp sand, the sawdust being first\r\nwell mixed dry with the cement and sand.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSUINT FOR WATERPROOFING FABRICS.--A German chemist has patented the\r\nwaterproofing of finely woven fabrics, linen, cotton, etc., by means\r\nof suint composition.

It has been found that a colored or dark pigment in the\r\nolfactory region of the nostrils is essential to perfect smell, and\r\nthis pigment is rarely deficient except when the whole animal is pure\r\nwhite. In these cases the creature is almost without smell or taste.\r\nThis, Dr. Ogle believes, explains the curious case of the pigs in\r\nVirginia adduced by Mr. Darwin, white pigs being poisoned by a\r\npoisonous root which does not affect black pigs. Mr. Darwin imputed\r\nthis to a constitutional difference accompanying the dark color, which\r\nrendered what was poisonous to the white colored animals quite\r\ninnocuous to the black. Dr. Ogle, however, observes that there is no\r\nproof that the black pigs eat the root, and he believes the more\r\nprobable explanation to be that it is distasteful to them, while the\r\nwhite pigs, being deficient in smell and taste, eat it, and are\r\nkilled. Analogous facts occur in several distinct families. White\r\nsheep are killed in the Tarentino by eating _hypericum criscum_, while\r\nblack sheep escape; white rhinoceros are said to perish from eating\r\n_euphorbia candelabrum_; and white horses are said to suffer from\r\npoisonous food where colored ones escape. Now it is very improbable\r\nthat a constitutional immunity from poisoning by so many distinct\r\nplants should, in the case of such widely different animals, be always\r\ncorrelated with the same difference of color; but the facts are\r\nreadily understood if the senses of smell and taste are dependent on\r\nthe presence of a pigment which is deficient in wholly white animals.\r\nThe explanation has, however, been carried a step further by\r\nexperiments showing that the absorption of odors by dead matter, such\r\nas clothing, is greatly affected by color, black being the most\r\npowerful absorbent, then blue, red, yellow, and lastly white. We have\r\nhere a physical cause for the sense-inferiority of totally white\r\nanimals which may account for their rarity in nature. For few, if any,\r\nwild animals are wholly white. The head, the face, or at least the\r\nmuzzle or the nose, are generally black. The ears and eyes are also\r\noften black; and there is reason to believe that dark pigment is\r\nessential to good hearing, as it certainly is to perfect vision. We\r\ncan therefore understand why white cats with blue eyes are so often\r\ndeaf--a peculiarity we notice more readily than their deficiency of\r\nsmell or taste.--_Dr. Wallace, British Association_, 1876.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED TROLLING HOOK.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry C. Brush, of Brush's Mills, N.Y., has patented through the\r\nScientific American Patent Agency an improved troller, the novel\r\nfeature in which consists in attaching a float to the shank of the\r\nimplement under the revolving blade, the object being to keep the\r\ntroller near the surface of the water, where the fish may see it more\r\nreadily, and whereby the liability of catching in weeds and logs is\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA is a float, attached to the shank, _a_, of the troller. B is the\r\nspoon, which is swiveled in the usual manner. The device is very\r\nsimple, and is claimed to prevent all the annoyance arising from the\r\nhook catching in sunken obstructions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPURIFICATION OF WOOL AND WOOLEN STUFF.\r\n\r\nThe process, patented some time ago, for the removal of straw, burrs,\r\netc., from wool, by treatment with sulphuric acid, has been modified\r\nby Lisc as follows: The stuff is worked for one to two hours in a bath\r\nconsisting of about 26 gallons sulphuric acid, of 3° to 6°, 1 lb.\r\nalum, ½ lb. salt, and 750 grains borax. It is then treated in a\r\ncentrifugal machine, and afterward subjected to a temperature of 212°\r\nto 248°. For removal of the acid it is first washed with pure water\r\nfor 1½ hours, then treated for two hours with fuller's earth, soda,\r\nand lime, and finally washed for two hours with fresh water. As\r\nsulphuric acid can only be employed with uncolored cloths, or such as\r\nhave been dyed with indigo, chloride of zinc and chloride of manganese\r\ndiluted to 6° are substituted with fabrics otherwise dyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCAFFEONE.\r\n\r\nCaffeone, the aromatic principle of coffee, may be isolated by\r\ndistilling 5 or 6 lbs. roasted coffee with water, agitating the\r\naqueous distillate with ether, and afterwards evaporating the ether.\r\nIt is a brown oil, heavier than water, in which it is only very\r\nslightly soluble. An almost imponderable quantity of this essential\r\noil will suffice to aromatize a gallon of water.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEMI-PLUNGER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe novel form of vessel, to which the above odd name has been given\r\nby its inventor, M. Donato Tommasi, of Paris, France, is a combination\r\nof a boat wholly submerged with a raft: a connecting link, to borrow\r\nthe naturalist's expression, between the submerged torpedo boat and\r\nthe monitor. The advantages which are expected to be realized from\r\nthis hybrid craft, the inventor describes as follows: \"It is evident\r\nthat a vessel, plunged several yards below the surface of the sea, is\r\nno longer influenced by wind or wave. Let the sea be agitated, let\r\nthere be the most violent tempest, yet the boat which navigates under\r\nwater will never be wrecked, for the same reason that a fish cannot be\r\ndrowned. * * * What a beautiful vision, that of traversing the ocean,\r\nas a balloon floats through the air, with the same tranquillity,\r\nwithout shocks, without the insupportable rolling and pitching!\" etc.\r\nThe construction of the invention introduced in this glowing manner\r\nwill be understood from Figs. 1 and 2. A is the plunger cylinder,\r\nshown with its side broken away in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1, G is the rudder,\r\nH the propeller, and I the tube through which sea water passes to the\r\npump. In Fig. 2, C is the smokestack, M M are compartments in which\r\nwater may be admitted to increase the weight, and hence the depth of\r\nflotation of the plunger, the same being filled or emptied by the\r\npump, P. N is the hold for merchandise, partitioned off from the\r\nboiler room as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--TOMMASI'S HEMI-PLUNGER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--THE HEMI-PLUNGER, THE SUBMERGED PORTION]\r\n\r\nFrom the plunger, A, rise two hollow columns, E, to which metallic\r\nplates, F, are attached to diminish friction through the water. These\r\nsupport the upper division or platform, B. The second shaft (not\r\nlettered), which rises above the platform in Fig. 1, serves to\r\nventilate the plunger. The columns, E, serve as shoots down which\r\nmerchandise is lowered to the compartments, N; and their upper ends\r\nare received in two immense inverted cups attached to the bottom of\r\nthe part, B. Through these cups pass large screws, which confine the\r\ncolumns so that, by removing the connection, the whole submarine\r\napparatus may in case of necessity be freed from the upper works. On\r\neach side of the platform, B, which is of elliptical figure, is a\r\nlarge float, seen in Fig. 3, which, by means of racks and gearing, may\r\nbe raised or lowered at will. Usually these floats are carried at a\r\nheight of a yard above the water. In calm weather, this distance is\r\nincreased, and in storms it is diminished, the object of the floats\r\nbeing to keep the whole vessel on an even plane, and to prevent too\r\nviolent oscillations. In order to facilitate navigation in shallow\r\nwater, the columns, E, may be made telescopic, and operated by\r\nhydraulic apparatus, so that they may be shortened at will. Any form\r\nof engine or propeller may be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--THE HEMI-PLUNGER ON A VOYAGE]\r\n\r\nBesides the advantage of the vessel being unaffected by waves, since\r\nits submerged portion travels far below them, the inventor claims that\r\nit will meet less resistance from the water than would a vessel of\r\ncorresponding volume sailing on the surface. It will make faster\r\nprogress, because it has no waves to mount and descend; and hence it\r\nalways travels in a nearly right line. The screw being submerged at a\r\ngreat depth will not tend to turn the vessel from her straight path.\r\nThe platform being easily detachable may serve as a raft in case of\r\ninjury to the submarine boat. For fast travel, on lakes, rivers, and\r\nshallow water generally, M. Tommasi proposes to support his platform\r\non two floats which rest on the surface of the water. No weight,\r\ntherefore, is thrown on the submarine vessel, which need be\r\nconstructed with only just enough buoyancy to sustain itself and its\r\nengine. In this way, the upper craft has no engine or other load than\r\nits cargo; and as it merely rests upon the surface, the inventor\r\nthinks that it will skim over the same like an ice boat on ice.\r\n\r\nFor war purposes, the hemi-plunger is especially adapted, because the\r\nvulnerable portions, engines, boiler, rudder, etc., are wholly out of\r\nthe reach of shot. Guns are mounted on the platform, which thus\r\nbecomes a circular or elliptical turret, just above the water when the\r\nvessel is in fighting trim. Instead of steel armor, M. Tommasi has a\r\nnew invention which he calls hydro-metallic plating. He reserves the\r\ndetails of this for future publication; but generally the armor\r\nconsists of tubes in which liquid is forced under a pressure\r\nequivalent to the resistance, say, of forged steel. He thinks this\r\nwill oppose shot as effectually as the solid metal, and will have the\r\nadditional advantage of superior lightness.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN-SOLES saturated with salicylic acid have been introduced as a\r\nremedy for perspiration of the feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPREME COURT PATENT DECISION.\r\n\r\nA United States patent was granted May 23, 1854, to John Myers and\r\nRobert G. Eunson for a wood-sawing machine for cutting boards into\r\nthin stuff for making picture frame and mirror backs. One of the\r\nprincipal claims was for the employment of two deflecting plates, one\r\non each side of the circular saw, by which both sides of the sawed\r\nstuff, as fast as it was cut, was slightly deflected so as not to bind\r\nupon the saw. Suit was brought by the patentee against Dunbar and\r\nHopper for infringement, and judgment was given in favor of the\r\npatentees, in the United States Circuit Court, this city, the damages\r\nawarded being $9,121. The defendants thereupon took an appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, which tribunal has reversed the\r\nfinding of the Circuit Court and dismissed the complaint. It was held\r\nby the Supreme Court that, inasmuch as the use of a single deflecting\r\nplate was old, well known, and in common use, it was simply an\r\nexercise of ordinary mechanical skill, and not a patentable invention,\r\nto employ a second deflecting plate, although the superiority of the\r\ndouble deflectors, for certain kinds of work, appears to be conceded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANING MILL MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planing machine, next to the saw, is perhaps the most important\r\nagent for the conversion and manipulation of wood in use; and before\r\nproceeding to consider it, in its present form, says the author of\r\nthis article, Mr. F.H. Morse, in the _Northwestern Lumberman_, it may\r\nnot be out of place to notice briefly its origin and history.\r\n\r\nThe first man to employ power in the operation of smoothing the\r\nsurface of wood was Sir Samuel Bentham, of London, England, and to him\r\nbelongs the honor of having discovered the principle upon which all\r\nplaning machines operate. A brief personal notice of this remarkable\r\ninventor will serve to show under what circumstances the planing\r\nmachine originated. His education was secured at the Westminster\r\nschool of London, and, as far as can be ascertained from the meager\r\nrecords of his life that have come down to us, was of the most\r\nthorough kind, both classical and scientific, that could be obtained\r\nat that time (1770). When his education was finished, he was bound to\r\nthe master shipwright of the Woolwich dockyard, to whom he served an\r\napprenticeship of seven years, acquiring in that time a practical\r\nknowledge of the methods of working in both wood and iron then in\r\nvogue, and receiving the best scientific instruction that the\r\ndevelopment of that period afforded. After his term of apprenticeship\r\nhad expired, he spent about two years in looking up the local\r\npeculiarities of other shipyards whose methods of working differed in\r\nsome respects from those of the Woolwich mechanics.\r\n\r\nIn 1779 he was ordered by the government to examine into the progress\r\nof shipbuilding in Northern Europe, and in carrying out this\r\ncommission he repaired to Russia, where he invented the first machine\r\nfor planing wood. Its mode of operation, whether reciprocating or\r\nrotating, it is impossible to ascertain positively, but the conclusion\r\narrived at, after referring to the specifications of his first patent,\r\nwhich was issued in 1791, is that it worked upon the former principle\r\nby means closely analogous to the operation of planing by hand. He\r\nseems to have made no use of his venture in Russia, though he resided\r\nthere several years and filled several important positions under the\r\nRussian Government. He returned to his native country in 1791 and\r\njoined his brother, Jeremy Bentham, who had at that time just received\r\nan appointment from the government to introduce industrial prisons in\r\nEngland. To utilize the unskilled labor of the convicts, the talents\r\nof Sir Samuel were called into use, and he devised a number of new\r\nmachines, the greater part of which were for working wood. For want of\r\na more suitable place, these machines were constructed at the\r\nresidence of Jeremy Bentham, which was thus converted into the first\r\nmanufactory for woodworking machines. This factory was established in\r\n1794, but was soon found to be too small for the purpose, and another\r\nbuilding was occupied. In a lecture before the Society of Arts, in\r\n1853, Professor Willis, referring to the shops of the Benthams, stated\r\nthat \"there were constructed machines for all general operations in\r\nwoodwork, including planing, molding, rebating, grooving, mortising,\r\nand sawing, both in coarse and fine work, in curved, winding, and\r\ntransverse directions, and shaping wood in complicated forms; and\r\nfurther, as an example, that all parts of a highly finished window\r\nsash are prepared, also all parts of an ornamented carriage wheel were\r\nmade so that nothing remained to be done by hand but to put the\r\ncomponent parts together.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1797 the Admiralty consented to the introduction of such of these\r\nmachines as could be used to advantage in the different dockyards, and\r\nthey were manufactured under the direction of Jeremy Bentham, and\r\nforwarded from time to time to Portsmouth and Plymouth, where they\r\nwere used with good results, performing all that was claimed for them.\r\n\r\nBentham was joined in 1810 by another genius (formerly in the employ\r\nof the brothers) by the name of Brunel, who had invented several\r\nvaluable machines, among which was one for shaping block shells, which\r\nseems to have had Bentham's indorsement. As Inspector General, in\r\n1803, Sir Samuel advised the Admiralty to introduce many of his new\r\nmachines, and also to permit the use of steam engines; accordingly,\r\nthe dockyards were fitted with engines for sawing, planing, boring,\r\ntenoning, mortising, etc. The labor saved by their use can be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that Brunel, who had assisted in their construction,\r\nreceived as a premium for his inventions the amount saved in the yards\r\nby their use in one year, which reached the respectable sum of\r\n$80,000. In the same year the government settled with Jeremy Bentham,\r\nafter arbitration, and allowed him for machines furnished the yards\r\nand prisons, $100,000. We learn from testimony given before the\r\narbitrators that \"Sir Samuel Bentham prepared a system of machinery\r\nfor the employment of men without skill, and particularly with a view\r\nto utilizing convict labor. In 1793 patents were taken out on these\r\ninventions to secure their exclusive use for the prisons.\" The\r\ntestimony states that no skill was required in the use of these\r\nmachines; they were introduced into the dockyards and worked by common\r\nlaborers. It was claimed that nine tenths of the labor was saved by\r\nthe use of Bentham's machines, which proves that they were at least\r\neffective, which cannot be said in all cases of those of modern\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nThe patent of Bentham, issued in 1793, is doubtless one of the most\r\nremarkable ones ever issued, both for the importance of the inventions\r\nit protected and the clearness with which they and the principles on\r\nwhich they operated are described. Richards, in referring to that\r\nsection of this patent which relates to rotary tools for woodcutting,\r\nquotes the inventor as saying: \"The idea of adapting the rotative\r\nmotion of a tool with more or less advantage, to give all sorts of\r\nsubstances any shape that may be required, is my own, and, as I\r\nbelieve, entirely new.\"\r\n\r\nFor those not skilled in nor acquainted with the nature and extent of\r\nthe various operations in wood conversion which come under the head of\r\nshaping with rotary cutters, it will be difficult to convey an idea of\r\nthe invention here set forth; it includes, indeed, nearly all\r\noperations in woodworking, and as an original invention may be said to\r\nconsist in the discovery of the fact that flat surfaces, or surfaces\r\nof any contour, can be properly prepared by the action of rotating\r\ntools. It is not to be wondered at that such an operation should not\r\nhave been sooner discovered, for even at the present time there are\r\nfew processes in treating material which seem so anomalous as that of\r\nplaning a flat surface with cutters revolving in a circle of a few\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn reference to planing mouldings, it is said: \"If the circumference\r\nof a circular cutter be formed in the shape of any moulding, and\r\nprojecting above the bench no more than necessary, the piece being\r\nshoved over the cutter will thus be cut to a moulding corresponding to\r\nthe cutter--that is, the reverse of it, just as a plane iron cuts the\r\nreverse. If a plane cutter, such as that above spoken of for cutting a\r\ngroove in the breadth of a piece, be made so thick, or, as we might be\r\napt to say now, so broad, or so long, as to cover the whole breadth of\r\nthe piece, it will present the idea of a roller. This I call a cutting\r\nroller; it maybe employed in many cases with great advantage to\r\nperform the office of a plane.\"\r\n\r\nThe cutting roller of Bentham is the present cutter block of England,\r\nor the cutting cylinder of America, and after what has been quoted it\r\nmay be seen that the idea of rotary planing and moulding machines had\r\nbeen fully grasped by Bentham. He goes on as usual to the various\r\nconditions which attach to the process of planing, and says further:\r\n\"if a cutting roller of this sort be placed with its axis horizontal\r\nand the bench beneath, it may be made to rise and lower. The bench\r\n(machine) may be very readily adjusted, so as to determine the\r\nthickness to which a piece will be reduced by being passed under the\r\nroller.\" \"To gain time, cutters may be applied to different sides of a\r\npiece at once, and such of them as make parallel cuts may be mounted\r\non the same spindle.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts would not be out of place in an explanatory lecture or\r\nessay on woodcutting at the present day, and cannot help awakening\r\nsurprise that they should have been written eighty-three years ago,\r\nwhen there had, so far as we know, been no precedents, nor even\r\nsuggestions from previous practice.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing shows that nearly all the fundamental principles, upon\r\nwhich woodcutting by machinery in its present development depends,\r\nwere familiar to Sir Samuel Bentham, and though his name has been\r\nalmost forgotten, it may be safely asserted that he gave to the world\r\nmore useful inventions than any other man of his age. His work shows\r\nthroughout a constant method and system of reasoning, which point\r\nrather to a life of persistent labor than to one of what would\r\nordinarily be called genius. That latter quality he must certainly\r\nhave possessed in the highest degree, for without it even his\r\nknowledge and experience could not have been equal to the work he\r\naccomplished. Directed to different ends, his talent and genius would\r\ndoubtless have secured for him a fame that would live for years,\r\nthough it does not seem possible that he could have conferred upon the\r\nworld a greater benefit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUICIDE STATISTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious and suggestive table of statistics has recently appeared in\r\nFrance, which will doubtless prove of much value in the hands of\r\nstudents of psychology and nervous mental ailments. It relates to\r\nsuicides; and the conditions, etc., of the people who made away with\r\nthemselves in 1874 in France are taken as the basis of the figures. In\r\nthat year, 5,617 suicides occurred, the largest number ever known in\r\nany one year in the country. Of these, 4,435, or 79 per cent., were\r\ncommitted by men, 1,182, or 21 per cent., by women. In spite of the\r\ncareful investigations of the police, the ages of 105 people could be\r\ndetermined. The 5,512 others are divided as follows: 16 years, 29;\r\nbetween 16 and 21 years, 193; between 21 and 40 years, 1,477; between\r\n40 and 60 years, 2,214; exceeding the last mentioned age, 1,599. About\r\n36 per cent. of these unfortunates were unmarried, 48 per cent.\r\nmarried, and 16 per cent. widowers. Of those which constituted the\r\nlast two classes, nearly two thirds had children. More than seven\r\ntenths of the suicides were effected by strangulation or drowning. The\r\ncrime was most frequently committed during spring, when 31 per cent.\r\nof the whole number destroyed themselves; during other seasons the\r\npercentages were: in summer, 27; in winter, 23; in autumn, 19.\r\n\r\nIncluded in the tables are the results of the judicial inquests,\r\nshowing the professions and callings of the deceased. About 33 per\r\ncent. were farmers, 30 per cent. mechanics, 4 per cent. merchants or\r\nbusiness men, 16 per cent. members of the liberal professions, 4 per\r\ncent. servants, and 13 percent. were destitute of any calling. The\r\ntable even analyzes, in all but 481 people, the motives which caused\r\nthe fatal act. Thus we are told that 652 killed themselves because of\r\nreverses in fortune, 701 through family troubles, 572 through\r\ndrunkenness, 243 through love, debauchery, etc.; 798 died to avoid\r\nphysical suffering, 59 to avoid the penalties of capital crimes, 489\r\nfor unclassified troubles, and 1,622 were clearly shown to have been\r\nafflicted with some mental disease.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FROST PLANT OF RUSSIA.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Williams, of Winoa, Ohio, has written a letter to that\r\nveteran botanist, Humphrey Marshall, of Chester county, Pa., on the\r\nsubject of the abovenamed plant, and my opinion concerning it has been\r\nasked for. Seeds of this plant were obtained by citizens of Boston,\r\nwho had snow brought from the White Mountains and from the coast of\r\nLabrador, and who stated that they have \"now the most unbounded\r\nsatisfaction and pleasure of announcing that all signs are favorable\r\nto the realization of their fondest hopes.\" This wonderful plant, it\r\nseems, was found amid the perpetual snows of the northern boundaries\r\nof Siberia, in 1863, by Count Swinoskoff, the eminent Russian\r\nbotanist, and it was by him cultivated at St. Petersburgh. The account\r\nsent me is very vague, and is evidently not from the pen of a\r\nbotanist. It is stated that it comes forth on the first day of the\r\nyear, grows to the height of three feet, and flowers on the third day.\r\nIt continues in bloom for twenty-four hours, then dissolves itself,\r\nbeing of the finest snow; it has a stalk one inch in diameter, and\r\nleaves, three in number, 1½ inches wide, covered with infinitesimal\r\nfrost or snow cones. The flower is of the shape of a star, with petals\r\n3 inches long and ½ inch wide at the broadest part, forming a\r\nbasketwork of frost. The seeds are like a pin's head. This is about\r\nall that can be gleaned from the description, and is by no means\r\nsatisfactory. Allow me to present my humble views of an analogous\r\ndiscovery of frostwork on December 6, 1856, in a sandy loam in Chester\r\ncounty, Pa., near the Paoli monument. In the _Horticultural Journal_\r\nof Philadelphia, then edited by J. Jay Smith (New Series, volume vii.,\r\npage 73, 1857), an account was published of my observations then.\r\nThese I have since more fully confirmed. The common dittany (cunila\r\nMariana) is frequently met with in December, with the base of the stem\r\nsurrounded with shellwork of ice, of a pearly whiteness. Dr.\r\nDarlington, in his \"Flora Cestrica\" published in 1853, page 199, under\r\nthe article cunila, observes: \"In the beginning of winter, after a\r\nrain, very curious ribbons of ice may be observed, attached to the\r\nbase of the stems, produced, I presume, by the moisture of the earth\r\nrising in the dead stems by capillary attraction, and then being\r\ngradually forced out horizontally, through a slit, by the process of\r\nfreezing. The same phenomenon has been observed in other plants. See\r\nobservations on _helianthemum_, page 27.\" Had the doctor given a more\r\nextended investigation, I fancy he would have agreed with me as to the\r\ncause. I found hundreds of diversified specimens. I am not aware that\r\nit was after a rain, but I took up a number of the plants, and always\r\nfound a vigorous scaly root bud, undergoing development at this early\r\nseason under ground, to produce a new stem the following spring. I\r\ncame to the conclusion that, as the temperature was below freezing and\r\nsnow was on the ground, the expanding bud, in close proximity to the\r\nsurface, gave out sufficient caloric or warmth to generate vapor from\r\nthe moist soil. This vapor rising around the stem of the plant, and\r\nattracted by it, becomes congealed into what we term hoar-frost, in\r\nnumerous forms; some like shellwork, others like tulips, with radiated\r\npetals, variously contorted, and often as symmetrical as snowflake\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Root-bud and frost-flower of the Cunila Mariana\r\n(Maryland Dittany). A, the developing or budding root. B, the old stem\r\nof the previous year. C, the congealed vapor or hoarfrost, forming the\r\nfirst flower of various shapes.]\r\n\r\nThat plants in germinating have the power of generating heat was\r\nproved by Mr. Hunter and by Lamarck. Experiments of Hales and Du Hamel\r\nshow that vegetation is not wholly suspended, however cold it may be;\r\nand that there is a regular and gradual progress till the returning\r\nwarmth of spring gives a greater degree of velocity to the juices,\r\nrendering their development more vigorous and apparent. If the\r\ncrystallization takes place when the air is calm, the crystals will be\r\nregularly formed; otherwise, when windy, I have seen them like a shell\r\nwithin a shell, very thin, of a pearly whiteness. Professor Tyndall\r\nhas shown in a very beautiful manner that ice is but an agglomeration\r\nof snow crystals: the transparency of the former being due to the\r\nexpulsion of the air, entrapped in and causing the whiteness and\r\nopacity of the latter. There is a formation called the snow plant of\r\nCalifornia, which arises to some height, and has been compared to\r\nvarious things, a fountain convoluted and enlarged above, a\r\ncrystallized small bushy shrub, etc.; but on closer inquiry, I have\r\nfailed as yet to get any definite ideas to its true character. Some\r\nbulbs in the soil might cause such formations by the congelation of\r\nvapor deposited successively upon itself, or the stems of the previous\r\nyear's growth yet remaining, and thus give them a sheathing of\r\nfrosting.\r\n\r\nThe shape of a star is common in snow crystals, which we all know\r\nassume the most beautiful forms, and which are illustrated in various\r\npublications. The eminent botanist Count Swinoskoff should give us\r\nsome clue as to the genus or character of the plant, the flower of\r\nwhich, we are told, melted away on being touched, and as to the\r\nstamens, the diamond seeds like a pin's head, etc. The whole needs\r\nfurther explanation.\r\n\r\nI trust those Bostonians who are in such hope will edify the public as\r\nto the final result of their experiment. What has that veteran in\r\nbotany, Dr. Asa Gray, to say about it? Let some one well qualified\r\ntell us more about this frost flower of Russia.\r\n\r\n                                     J.

So much\r\nis the work behindhand in some of the departments that, as the\r\nCommissioner states in his report, some of the attorneys who require\r\ncertified copies of papers have been obliged to employ their own\r\nclerks to do office copying, and then had to pay the full legal rate\r\nof ten cents per hundred words, the same as though the Office had done\r\nthe work. This style of _economizing_, by making inventors pay two\r\nprices for their work, may be \"reform\" in the eyes of the average\r\nDemocratic Congressman; but speaking for myself, as one of those who\r\nhave had to pay twice, I would prefer to dispense with this style of\r\n\"retrenchment and reform,\" and therefore ask you, Messrs. Editors, in\r\nbehalf of the inventors of the United States, to so stir up our\r\nlegislators that they will allow the Office sufficient of its own\r\nfunds to do its work properly, and not delay the work of the\r\ninventor--work that he has to pay for in advance--and so prevent the\r\ndiscouragement and trouble which these delays always cause.\r\n\r\nAs the Patent Office has been doing a good business lately, there\r\nappears to be some attempt at rivalry at the Capitol, as the following\r\nlist of applications for extension will show:\r\n\r\nLIST OF APPLICANTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF PATENTS NOW BEFORE CONGRESS.\r\n\r\n  ---- Reynolds, power loom brake.\r\n  Strong & Ross, scales.\r\n  Wm. & W.H.

Turner, Arculous Wyckoff, De Witt C.\r\nCummings, Moses Marshall, J.W. Fowler, and Holloway & Graham. Many of\r\nthe applicants have apparently given up their cases for this session,\r\nbut they may be only lying back to its close in hopes that in the\r\nfinal rush their \"little bills\" may slip through easily.\r\n\r\nSeveral bills tinkering at the patent laws are before Congress, and\r\none of these (House Bill, No. 3,370) passed the House on the 30th ult.\r\nIt has one section that may be made to work great harm to inventors,\r\nas it prevents infringers being sued for more than one year's damages\r\nprevious to notice of infringement being given. By this bill, if it is\r\nallowed to become a law, a person will be able to build and use\r\npatented machines or processes for years in some out of the way place\r\nwhere the inventor cannot easily find him; and should he be\r\ndiscovered, he can only be sued for one year's damages. There are\r\nother sections in this bill which will bear ventilating.\r\n\r\nAnother bill, introduced into the Senate by Mr. Paddock, provides that\r\nall appeals from the Board of Appeals shall be direct to the Supreme\r\nCourt of the District of Columbia, instead of to the Commissioner as\r\nheretofore; and that the fees shall be the same as now paid to the\r\nlatter official.\r\n\r\nMr. Sampson has introduced into the House a bill changing section 4886\r\nso that it shall read as follows: \"SEC. 4886. Any person who has\r\ndiscovered any new or useful art, machine, manufacture or composition\r\nof matter, or any new or useful improvement thereof, not known or used\r\nby others in this country, and not patented or described in any\r\nprinted publication in this or any foreign country, before his\r\ninvention or discovery thereof, and not in public use or on sale for\r\nmore than two years prior to his application, unless the same is\r\nproved to have been abandoned, may, upon payment of the fees required\r\nby law, and other due proceedings had, obtain a patent therefor:\r\n_Provided, That the manufacture or composition of drugs as a medicine\r\nshall not be patentable_.\" The change is the addition of the words in\r\nitalics.\r\n\r\nThe Smithsonian Institute has sent to Congress a memorial setting\r\nforth that the present Institute building is already too small for the\r\nvast amount of articles already placed there on exhibition; that at\r\nthe late Centennial Exposition the Commissioners of various countries\r\npresented their entire collection of exhibits to the United States,\r\nwhich had delegated their care to the Smithsonian Institute, and they\r\nhad no place for them; that the armory building was being fitted up\r\nfor the reception of the United States Centennial collection, and they\r\ntherefore asked that a building be erected for the foreign collection,\r\nwhich could be used as a national museum, or otherwise we should have\r\nto offend the donors by keeping their valuable gifts stowed away in\r\ncellars and other rubbish receptacles.\r\n\r\nMr. Eads, who is now here on the lookout for his pay for his work on\r\nthe South Pass of the Mississippi's mouth, has received intelligence\r\nfrom the resident engineer at the jetties that the channel through the\r\nshoal at the head of the South Pass is now twenty-two feet deep, and\r\nthat the least width at which twenty feet depth is found is one\r\nhundred and ten feet. The principal works to improve this shoal were\r\nconstructed during the last six months. The low stage and feeble\r\ncurrent of the river has delayed their effect until the recent flood\r\nfrom the Ohio reached them, and the problem of deepening the shoal has\r\nbeen fully solved by the rapid scouring away of the obstruction. It is\r\nstated that the channel is quite straight and is deepening rapidly.\r\nThe channel through the jetties at the mouth of the Pass is twenty-one\r\nfeet deep. The entrance from the sea through the jetties is one\r\nthousand feet wide, and through the works at the head of the Pass\r\neight hundred feet.\r\n\r\nA recent telegram from Nevada states that the Sutro Tunnel (of which I\r\ngave you some particulars in one of my letters) has now progressed a\r\ntotal distance of 15,565 feet and has fairly entered the mineral belt,\r\nand will soon help to increase the already vast products of the\r\nComstock lode.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of mining, I will state that the amount of\r\nquicksilver produced in California has increased so immensely during\r\nthe last two years that it has attracted the attention of all\r\ninterested in the article throughout the world. The receipts for the\r\nyear have been 63,928 and the exports 48,010 flasks. In addition to\r\nthe receipts there, probably about six thousand flasks were shipped\r\ndirect from the mines to Nevada, thus bringing up the total production\r\nto over 70,000 flasks, a gain in round numbers of from twelve thousand\r\nto fifteen thousand flasks over 1875. The exports in that year were\r\n34,844 flasks, or 13,666 less than in 1876.\r\n\r\n                                       Occasional.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTYRIAN PURPLE INK FOR MARKING LINEN.--Von Bele gives the following\r\nmethod for preparing an ink for marking linen and cotton: Neutralize\r\n75 grains of carbonate of ammonia with pure nitric acid, and triturate\r\n45 to 60 grains of carmine with the solution.

Newberry,\r\nPresident, in the chair. Mr. A.A. Julian, A.M., read a paper on the\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ROCK AND MINERAL SECTIONS FOR MICROSCOPIC STUDY.\r\n\r\nThe speaker described in detail the various operations, exhibited the\r\ndifferent kinds of apparatus employed, showed the operations, and\r\nexhibited the finished sections. In some rocks a thin chip can be\r\nbroken off, others require to be sawn, and for the latter purpose the\r\ndiamond saw is best. Having obtained the chip, it is first polished on\r\none side, then cemented to a little square of glass, and the other\r\nside polished in the same way. The sections must not be too thick, nor\r\ntoo thin; they are usually made from a hundredth to a thousandth of an\r\ninch thick. Lathes employed in polishing minerals require to be\r\nprovided with conical spindles, so that the wear, due to grit and\r\nemery dust getting on them, may be readily taken up. The grinding\r\nwheel may be either horizontal or vertical; the former has the\r\nadvantage that the mineral can be held in either hand; with the latter\r\nonly the right hand can be employed, and that in an awkward and\r\ntiresome position. Mr. Julian then referred briefly to the kinds of\r\nemery, its preparation by elutriation, etc., and cautioned operators\r\nagainst using rouge or tin putty powder in polishing rock sections,\r\nalthough they may be employed in polishing certain minerals and gems.\r\nThe object of making the rock sections being to study their\r\nconstituents and determine what minerals enter into their composition,\r\nit is important that no foreign substance, liable to adhere to the\r\nspecimen and to be mistaken for one of its ingredients, be placed on\r\nthe section while grinding. Lastly, the minerals are mounted on glass,\r\nwith or without covers, by means of Canada balsam. Square glasses are\r\nto be preferred to the long and narrow strips, usually employed, as\r\nless liable to break in the center, and more easily revolved on the\r\nstage of a microscope.\r\n\r\nMr. L.H. Landy then exhibited, by means of the gas microscope, several\r\nbeautiful rock sections, both American and German. The same gentleman\r\nalso showed the effect of passing polarized light through certain\r\ncrystal sections, the black cross and rainbow-hued rings revolving\r\nlike so many wheels as the polarizer was turned.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of this brilliant exhibition, Dr. P.T. Austen made\r\nsome remarks on\r\n\r\n\r\nLABORATORY MANIPULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe points referred to were the apparently unimportant details which\r\noften contribute so much to the ease and pleasure of working. First,\r\nthe use of square pieces of felt, such as are used under beer glasses\r\nin saloons, for setting hot beakers and flasks on to prevent chilling\r\nand consequent cracking. Second, in crystallizing substances for\r\nexamination under the microscope; one watch glass is placed upon\r\nanother with the substance between them, and the upper glass filled\r\nwith ether, the cold produced by its evaporation hastening the\r\ncrystallization. Third, removing precipitates and solid matter from\r\nflasks, by heating to boiling, and inverting in a vessel of water.\r\nFourth, crystallization by gradual dilution. Fifth, filter paper\r\nwithout ash. In German laboratories it is customary to dissolve out\r\nthe mineral matter from white filtering paper by washing in dilute\r\nhydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. Sixth, the use of infusorial\r\nsilica for drying purposes. Being very porous, it will absorb five\r\ntimes its own volume of water. If a filter paper, holding a wet\r\nprecipitate, be placed upon a layer of this earth, it will become\r\nquite dry in a very short space of time. Mr. Austen also remarked that\r\nsubstances retain their heat for several days when placed in cork\r\nboxes. To keep a substance air-tight, it may be placed in a flask, the\r\nneck painted with a solution of india rubber in chloroform, and a\r\nplate of glass laid upon it. The solvent quickly evaporates, leaving a\r\ndelicate film of rubber, which holds the glass tightly in place.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting of the Chemical Section will be held February 12; of\r\nthe Mineralogical Section, February 19.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL REPORT OF THE PATENT OFFICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual report to Congress of the Commissioner of Patents, for the\r\nyear 1876, has made its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe amount received on applications for patents, reissues, designs,\r\nextensions, caveats, disclaimers, appeals, trade marks, labels,\r\ncopies, etc., was $757,987.65. The amount paid for salaries was\r\n$425,930; other expenses, $226,612. Total payments, $652,542.\r\n\r\n  Number of applications for patents during the year 1876         21,425\r\n  Number of patents issued, including reissues and designs        15,595\r\n  Number of applications for extension of patents                      2\r\n  Number of patents extended                                           3\r\n  Number of caveats filed during the year                          2,697\r\n  Number of patents expired during the year                          814\r\n  Number of patents allowed but not issued for want of final fee   3,353\r\n  Number of applications for registering of trade marks            1,081\r\n  Number of trade marks registered                                   959\r\n  Number of applications for registering of labels                   650\r\n  Number of labels registered                                        402\r\n\r\nOf the patents granted there were to--\r\n\r\n  Citizens of the United States                                   16,239\r\n  Subjects of Great Britain                                          511\r\n  Subjects of France                                                 104\r\n  Subjects of other foreign governments                              172\r\n                                                                   -----\r\n  Total                                                           17,026\r\n\r\nThe number of applications for patents was a little less than during\r\nthe previous year. The Commissioner suggests that Congress should\r\nappropriate $50,000 to promote the printing of the old patents; that\r\nadditional examiners be employed, and more clerks, for the purpose of\r\nexpediting the business of the office; that the price of the Official\r\nGazette be reduced, also the fee for trade mark registration; that the\r\nlibrary fund be increased; that more space be provided for models, and\r\nfor the transaction of business.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the Centennial, the value of new improvements, and the\r\nservice of the Patent Office in stimulating discovery, the Acting\r\nCommissioner speaks as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The display made at the Exposition by the Patent Office was\r\n    creditable in every respect, and excited general attention.\r\n    About 5,000 models of inventions, representing the leading\r\n    branches of the arts and manufactures, were exhibited in\r\n    suitable cases, and properly labeled, the various publications\r\n    of the Office were displayed, its practice fully explained to\r\n    all inquirers, and copies of the Patent Laws and the Office\r\n    regulations and forms freely distributed. The knowledge of our\r\n    patent system thus imparted to foreigners and all others unable\r\n    to visit Washington has more than repaid the small cost\r\n    attendant upon the representation. The exhibits were sent from\r\n    and returned to the Office with scarcely any damage being\r\n    suffered.\r\n\r\n    \"But the array of models, etc., made by the Patent Office at the\r\n    Exposition was not needed to illustrate the value of our patent\r\n    practice. The wisdom of that system was demonstrated in the most\r\n    practical and triumphant manner in nearly every branch of that\r\n    munificent enterprise. Not only in the grand display of\r\n    labor-saving machinery, but in the vast collection of\r\n    manufactured articles, and even in the department of fine arts,\r\n    were seen the fruits of that provision in our Constitution\r\n    giving to Congress the power 'to promote the progress of science\r\n    and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and\r\n    inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and\r\n    discoveries.'\r\n\r\n    \"Whatever persons may do in a 'perfect condition of society' in\r\n    sharing, without price, the fruits of their labors with others,\r\n    it must be apparent to the dullest observer that the wonderful\r\n    growth of the useful arts in this country is due, thus far, to\r\n    the protection given by our Government to property in\r\n    inventions--a property as sacred as any other class of property,\r\n    and whose value is determined by the same general law of supply\r\n    and demand.\r\n\r\n    \"It may be safely said that two thirds of the manufacturing\r\n    interests of the country are based upon patents, and the welfare\r\n    of all such interests are intimately connected with the welfare\r\n    of the patent system. During the past seven years a larger\r\n    number of applications for patents were filed and patents\r\n    granted than during the entire seventy-eight preceding years,\r\n    reaching back to the enactment of the first patent law. The\r\n    needs of the Office have advanced in proportion to this sudden\r\n    and vast increase of work, but have been but partly supplied.\r\n    Nay, in fact, its already scanty force and accommodations have\r\n    been actually reduced at a time when most required. If these\r\n    vast interests, and the future promotion of science and the\r\n    useful arts are to be encouraged, a liberal recognition must be\r\n    made of the wants of this Office.\r\n\r\n    \"The Examining Corps, the duties in which are most arduous and\r\n    exacting, comprises gentlemen of legal, as well as scientific,\r\n    attainments. It should be re-inforced by more of the same\r\n    character. They should be relieved, by legislation, of continual\r\n    embarrassment by reason of meager salaries and fears of removal\r\n    incident to merely political changes. The Office would then be\r\n    spared the continual loss of its most experienced and efficient\r\n    men.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRON TRADE IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British _Mercantile Gazette_ of January 15 states that the\r\nsituation and prospects of the iron trade have not materially improved\r\nin the month of December, but some week or two must elapse yet before\r\ntrade returns to its regular channels. In the north of England the\r\ntone of the market is tolerably cheerful, and prospects, though still\r\nvague, are considered encouraging. Makers of pig iron go into the next\r\nquarter with a good supply of orders on their books, and merchants and\r\nconsumers are desirous of buying over the first half of the year.\r\nNotwithstanding the great depression which has ruled throughout 1876,\r\nthere is likely to be a greater production of pig iron by several\r\nthousand tons than ever there was before, and the total make must\r\nconsiderably exceed two million tons, which is twice the quantity\r\nturned out in Scotland, though in the latter district a greater number\r\nof furnaces have been kept in blast. Prices are nominally the same as\r\nwere quoted last week, but show an upward tendency. The bulk of the\r\nmills and forges, foundries, etc., have resumed work, and the finished\r\niron trade is again in full swing. The plate department is well\r\nprovided with orders, but the rail manufacturers, though rather better\r\noff than they were, are still in a poor position. The miscellaneous\r\nbranches of the iron trade, such as the foundries and tube, wire, and\r\ncut-nail manufactories are generally well off for orders, and\r\nengineers find plenty to do. The wages agreement in the finished iron\r\ntrade ends this week, but it is thought that no alteration will be\r\nmade. In the South Staffordshire iron trade, work has been only\r\npartially resumed as yet, and many of the mills and forges will not be\r\nstarted until the quarterly meetings, next week. Orders have rarely\r\nbeen so scarce as they are at this moment, arrears having been pretty\r\ngenerally cleared off before the holidays, and no new ones coming in.\r\nNevertheless, the feeling of the trade is more hopeful than it was a\r\nmonth ago. The number of furnaces in blast in this district is now\r\nonly 58 out of 153; but should the expected improvement in trade\r\narrive with the quarterly meeting, this number will soon be increased.\r\nIn the finished iron branch, in which quotations for marked iron\r\ncontain the basis of $45 for bars, makers of leading brands of sheets\r\nand bars are better off than the manufacturers of cheap iron, who\r\nsuffer much from competition in the north. Some considerable contracts\r\nfor girders, bridges, gasometers, etc., are under execution at the\r\nworks devoted to constructive ironwork; but the merchant iron trade,\r\nas a whole, is very dull. Unmarked iron is weak and variable, and to\r\nthis circumstance may be attributed the reduction, announced this\r\nweek, in various descriptions of common iron hardware.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED LATHE CHUCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed engravings represent a new lathe chuck, which may be\r\nconstructed of any size, which holds tools with great firmness, and\r\nwhich is provided with an improved device for taking up wear and for\r\nthe separate adjustment of the jaws. The implement is made of the best\r\nsteel, by special machinery, so that its parts are interchangeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINTON'S LATHE CHUCK.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2 represent the chuck taken apart so as to exhibit the\r\ninterior. Figs. 3 and 4 are sectional views. A is a collar which\r\nencircles the spindle, and has formed on its outer face a bevel gear\r\nwheel, B. C, Fig. 3, is the rear portion of the shell of the chuck\r\ninclosing the forward part of the collar, A. Also on said collar, A,\r\nis a washer, D, which rests against the shell, C, and a nut, E, which\r\ntravels on a thread formed on the collar. As it is necessary, as will\r\nbe explained further on, to turn the entire shell in order to move the\r\njaws, the use of the nut just described is to jam the part, C, and the\r\nenlarged portion of the collar, A, tightly together, and so rigidly\r\nhold the jaws in any position in which they may be adjusted. Fig. 1\r\nrepresents the outer face of the chuck with the jaws and their working\r\nmechanism. Within the chuck, each jaw has attached to it a screw, E.\r\nThis enters a bevel wheel, F. As the jaws are incapable of any but\r\nradial motion, it follows that, when the chuck is rotated bodily and\r\nthe bevel wheels engage on the motionless gear wheel, B, the effect of\r\nthe rotation of said bevel wheels is to cause the jaws to travel\r\ntoward or from the center of the chuck face. And it will be further\r\nclear that this motion must be simultaneous in all the jaws. As the\r\nouter portion of the chuck is rigidly secured to the shell, C, by\r\nscrews, of course when that shell is jammed, as already stated, by the\r\nnut, E, it becomes impossible to turn the chuck bodily; and hence the\r\nbevel wheels cannot be rotated around the main gear wheel, and\r\nconsequently the position of the jaws cannot be altered. The above\r\ncomprises the mechanism proper of the device, that is to say, all that\r\nis necessary for moving or clamping the jaws.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another feature of considerable importance yet to\r\nbe described, and that is the device for taking up any play of the\r\njaws due to wear, and which enables each to be adjusted so that the\r\nmotion of all may be uniform. By referring to Fig. 4, it will be seen\r\nthat, above the bevel wheel, there is a projection, into the threaded\r\ninterior of which, as already explained, the jaw screw enters.\r\nSurrounding this projection is a sleeve, G, the outer surface of which\r\nis threaded to fit a similarly threaded aperture, cut partly in the\r\nshell and partly in the face plate. The upper portion of the sleeve is\r\nnotched to receive a wrench or driver; and beneath the sleeve an armed\r\nwasher, H, is slipped over the projection. The arms of this washer\r\nenter recesses in the face plate. It will be evident that, by turning\r\nthe sleeve, F, so that the screw works inward, the jaw and all its\r\nappendages will be moved bodily in corresponding direction. But its\r\nmovement is limited by the arms of the washer, G, which, through the\r\nnarrowness of the recesses, are allowed only just enough play to\r\ncompensate for slight changes in the jaw. As the above device is\r\napplied to every jaw, it follows that any one of them may be nicely\r\nadjusted from the outside, so that all are caused to grasp the tool\r\naccurately. The spindle, instead of being solid as represented, may be\r\nmade hollow. Patented to J.H. Vinton, August 18, 1874. For further\r\ninformation, address the manufacturer, Mr. F. Armstrong, Bridgeport,\r\nConn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREW-CUTTING LATHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Screw-Cutting Lathes]\r\n\r\nAn English lathe, now in use at the Rogers Locomotive Works, Paterson,\r\nN.J., contains several novel features. The ways are flat on the faces,\r\ninstead of having raised Vs; and this is a feature of all English\r\nlathes, and of those known in this country as the Freeland lathes. A\r\ngreat deal of discussion has at various times taken place as to the\r\nrelative qualification or merits of these two forms of lathe bed. The\r\nadvocates of the flat way, with Vs at the edges of the way, claim\r\nsuperiority on the score of steadiness, increased wearing surface, and\r\nstrength; while, on behalf of the raised Vs, it is urged that, the Vs\r\nbeing true, the saddle is bound to travel true, because there can be\r\nno lost motion on the slides; whereas any lost motion, from want of\r\nadjustment of the slides in flat ways, is liable to be reproduced\r\ntwofold in the work, for the reason that 1/100 of an inch lateral\r\nmovement of the slide carriage becomes 1/50 of an inch in the diameter\r\nof the work. Then, again, the most of the wear upon a lathe bed takes\r\nplace at the part at and near the running center of the lathe, because\r\nthe saddle is, on account of short jobs, more used in that part than\r\non any other. As a result, when wear has taken place, the saddle, if\r\nadjusted to suit the worn part, becomes too tight to travel over the\r\nunworn part of the bed; and hence, after the wear has taken place, a\r\nproper adjustment of the lathe saddle becomes impossible if the job is\r\na long one. In the case of raised Vs, however, the wear simply causes\r\nthe saddle to fall vertically, so that an amount of wear equal to\r\n1/100 of an inch would have the same effect as lowering the tool 1/100\r\ninch, its effect upon the work being almost imperceptible by ordinary\r\nmeasurement. On the other hand, however, V lathes are usually made\r\nwith either a weight or a spring to keep the saddle down; and as a\r\nresult, when the cutting tool stands far out from the tool post, the\r\nsaddle is apt to tip, especially in the case of boring with a lathe\r\ntool. In some cases, the raised Vs are accompanied with gibs to secure\r\nthe saddle; but in many instances the gibs are given too little\r\nwearing surface. In the lathe above referred to, there are three ways\r\nin one casting, with the slide angles on the outer edges. There are\r\nalso three separate and independent tail stocks fitting into the two\r\nopenings between the ways. The running head has one cone pulley\r\nconnected by suitable gearing to three face plates. The three centers\r\nat the running head are stationary. The slide rest saddle spans the\r\nthree ways, having a V slide which contains three separate slide\r\nrests, all connected by a nut to the feed screw, so that all three are\r\noperated by the one screw. In addition to this, the two back slide\r\nrests have the nuts so attached that they can be moved by means of a\r\nseparate screw, the object being to facilitate setting the cuts, since\r\nit would be a tedious matter to set all three tools to an equal cut,\r\nor to their desired respective cuts, without means of operating two of\r\nthem independently. To set the cut during screw-cutting operations,\r\nthe ingenious device shown in our engraving is provided. A represents\r\nthe cross-feed or slide rest screw, which operates the three slide\r\nrests. It is fast to the notched wheel, B, and is operated by it in\r\nthe usual way. C is a short screw which provides journal bearing for\r\nthe screw, A, by a plain hole. It is screwed on the outside, and the\r\nplate in which it fits acts as its nut. It is fast to the handle, D,\r\nand is in fact operated by it. The handle or lever is provided with a\r\ncatch, E, pivoted in the enclosed box, F, which also contains a means\r\nof detaining the catch in the notches of the wheel, or of holding it\r\nfree from the same when it is placed clear. If, then, the lever, D, be\r\nmoved back and forth the feed screw, A, and hence the three slide\r\nrests, will be operated; while, if the catch be placed in one of the\r\nnotches on the wheel, B, both the screws, A and C, will act to operate\r\nthe rests. When, therefore, the operator is cutting screws, he sets\r\nthe catch, E, into one of the notches so soon as the tools are\r\nproperly adjusted to the work; and then lifting the catch, E, he turns\r\nthe wheel, B, so that the catch falls into the next notch, and this\r\nputs the cut on. When the tool has taken that cut, and while the\r\nlatter saddle is traveling back, the catch is placed in the next\r\nnotch, and so on, the cut for the forward travel always being put on\r\nas above while the saddle is traveling back. Thus is insured an\r\nexactly equable amount of cut on the whole three rests. When the\r\nlever, D, is not in use, the catch is removed from the wheel, B, and\r\nis allowed to rest against the pins, G or A, provided for that\r\npurpose. For piston rods, or for work such as cutting jack screws,\r\nthis lathe is very useful. It is obviously, however, a special tool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL ORNAMENTS IN WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that the hedges are no longer green, and the trees stand black and\r\nbare on the landscape, is the time to seek for endless variety and\r\nbeauty waiting to be admired in its turn. What miniature fairy glens\r\nand grottoes are distributed over the hedge banks of our country\r\nlanes! Mosses, delicate and beautiful, may be found in the interstices\r\nof any old wall, or at the foot of almost any tree or shrub. In the\r\nwinter time mosses and lichens are found in fruit, and are beautiful\r\nobjects. A pocket microscope lens is essential for their proper\r\nobservation; and though the delicate carmine cups of the species known\r\nas the cup moss, and the familiar gray and yellow mosaic appearance we\r\nsee on twigs and branches on our way, are easily recognized, the study\r\nof this form of winter vegetation is an inexhaustible one, and is an\r\noccupation for a lifetime, if earnestly pursued. We do not however,\r\nsuggest that every one who endeavors to recognize the different\r\nspecies of moss, lichens, or fungi should necessarily do so through\r\nthe medium of the microscope; but it will greatly add to the pleasure\r\nof making a collection out of doors if there be a good microscope at\r\nhome, so that when the contents of the basket be turned out, after the\r\nwinter's walk, there should be interest even in the fragments left,\r\nafter a little pile of varied bits has been constructed, rivalling the\r\nchoicest summer bouquet in beauty of form and color. We have seen such\r\na collection formed into a beautiful object by raising a little mound\r\nof rough bits of bark in a plate or saucer, and placing on it\r\nvarieties of fungus of every shade of red, brown, yellow, and gray.\r\nThey seem to spring forth from a bed of sphagnum or bog moss of\r\nbrightest emerald green; while a clump of the screw wall moss in\r\nfruit, with its curious little box-like capsules, supports a gray or\r\nyellow lichen, which has been gently removed from some old wall or\r\ntree. A bit of stick or a twig, incrusted with a bright orange-colored\r\nlichen, supports a trailing branch of delicate green ivy, the most\r\nbeautiful and adaptable of all winter foliage. Over this little\r\narrangement is placed a bell glass, to preserve it from dust and the\r\neffect of a dry atmosphere; and we know how pleasing to the eye is its\r\nvaried beauty of form and color, lasting thus, a constant source of\r\npleasure, for many a day without renewal.--_Chambers' Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HARNESS COCKEYE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe illustrate herewith a very simple little device for attaching\r\ntraces to the single tree. It forms a secure fastening which may be\r\ninstantly attached, and which, by its construction, is prevented from\r\nwearing out rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 1 and 2]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows the cockeye attached to the single tree, and Fig. 2\r\nexhibits parts in section, displaying the construction very clearly.\r\nThe yoke is of the usual pattern. Swiveled to it is a long loop, which\r\nis chambered out to receive a spiral spring which acts upon a plunger.\r\nThe latter is provided with a follower having a semicircular notch,\r\nwhich corresponds in form to the inside of the end of the loop. The\r\nfollower also has guiding lips which extend over the sides of the\r\nloop. Through the yielding of the spring, the space between the\r\nfollower and loop adjusts itself to studs or hooks of any size.\r\nPatented December 12, 1876, through the Scientific American Patent\r\nAgency.

For a time, it\r\noccupied here some public attention, but only in a sensational way;\r\nand the sober discussion of the subject, which followed after its\r\nnovelty had worn off, led to the general opinion that, while every one\r\nmight be quite willing to see his dead neighbors cremated, no one\r\nwould acquiesce in the disposal of his friends and relatives in so\r\nabnormal a manner. Hence, with the single exception of the late\r\nrevolting exhibition in Pennsylvania, which we alluded to at the time,\r\nthe dead in this country have continued to be deposited in their\r\nhallowed resting places, and have not been packed away, in an\r\nincinerated state, in labeled urns. In Europe, however, cremation\r\nstill finds many warm adherents; and during last summer a congress of\r\nthe \"Friends of Cremation\" (a society which, we are informed by\r\n_Engineering_, whence we take the annexed engravings, has branches in\r\nvarious parts of the world), was held in Dresden. Before this meeting,\r\na large number of designs for cremation and mortuary buildings were\r\nbrought in competition, and finally the prize was awarded to Mr. G.\r\nLilienthal, a Berlin architect, for the imposing structure illustrated\r\nherewith.\r\n\r\nThis will be the grand temple of cremation when it is erected--a\r\nproceeding to take place in the dim future: when or where not stated.\r\nOn each side of a central chapel there is a circular memorial hall;\r\nand extending so as to inclose the garden of the establishment, on the\r\nsides of the halls are wings containing a large number of niches for\r\nthe reception of funeral urns.\r\n\r\nThe cremation ceremony is proposed to be as follows: The body, having\r\nbeen brought into the hall, is subjected to the usual medical\r\nexamination; or when an inquest is necessary, it is removed to offices\r\nin another part of the building, where the required investigation can\r\nbe held. When all is ready, the body, placed on the platform, B, Fig.\r\n2, is raised by a lift into the hall, A, where visitors are gathered,\r\nand here the result of the medical examination is declared, and\r\nwhatever preliminary religious ceremonies that are desired are\r\nperformed. The body is then transported to the chapel, E, in front of\r\nthe pulpit, F, where the burial service is performed. The bier is\r\nafterward lowered mechanically, and brought to the furnaces, which are\r\narranged in a semicircle and partitioned for the reception of several\r\nbiers. The ashes are subsequently placed in an urn, on which the\r\nname, etc., of the deceased are recorded, and which is set up in a\r\nsuitable niche.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--DESIGN FOR A CREMATION TEMPLE]\r\n\r\nThe building, which we illustrate both in elevation, Fig. 1, and in\r\nplan, Fig. 2, is designed to contain 100,000 urns, and is adapted for\r\na town of 200,000 inhabitants. The architect has certainly exhibited\r\nmuch taste in his design for the building, and has provided every\r\nconvenience in the internal arrangement for carrying on a large\r\nbusiness in the cremation line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--SECTION OF A CREMATION TEMPLE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO REJUVENATE AN OLD ROSE BUSH.\r\n\r\nNever give up a decaying rose bush till you have tried watering it two\r\nor three times a week with soot tea.

When it is used up, pour\r\nboiling hot water on the soot a second time.

His name was\r\nSylvester Bonaffon, a retired merchant of Philadelphia. His elaborate\r\ncollections were sold at auction, and their oddity has attracted\r\ngeneral attention. His chief mania was for clocks, which literally\r\ncovered every portion of available space in his apartments, whether\r\nthey were placed on chairs, tables, shelves, or hung against the wall.\r\nSome of these timepieces were of unique construction. One clock was\r\nmade to run for 400 days after one winding; another was set in the\r\ndashboard of his carriage, and he used Mr. Bonaffon also had an\r\nespecial fondness for electrical apparatus. His windows were provided\r\nwith ingenious burglar alarms, his rooms with fire alarms, and he\r\nignited his gas always by electricity. His place of business, his\r\nstable, the Continental Hotel where he dined, were all connected with\r\ninstruments in his room; and he even had perfected arrangements so\r\nthat he could set at home and send his own messages to California.\r\nBesides the clocks and electric apparatus, there was an immense\r\ncollection of _bric-a-brac_ of every conceivable variety, which was\r\nsold at the auction--as is usually the case--at prices much below\r\nthose paid by its late owner.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZING INFLUENCE OF SNOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nSnow is often called the \"poor man's manure;\" and if it is true that\r\nit has any manurial value, the farmer's prospects for the next season\r\nare certainly flattering. The body of snow upon the ground in all the\r\nNorthern and Middle States is very great, and millions of acres of\r\nland are covered by it as with a blanket of the whitest wool. It is\r\nprobable that seldom, perhaps never, has so wide an area of our\r\ncountry been covered as during this month of January, 1877. The\r\nquestion whether snow is capable of affording to lands any of the\r\nelements of fertility is one often asked; and in reply, the Boston\r\n_Journal of Chemistry_ says that it probably is. The atmosphere holds\r\nammonia and some other nitrogenous products, which are without doubt\r\nbrought to the soil by snowflakes as well as by rain drops.\r\nExperiments both here and abroad would seem to prove the truth of this\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nRains are not only valuable for the moisture which they supply, but\r\nfor what they bring to us from the atmosphere. During a thunderstorm\r\nnitric acid is produced in considerable quantities; and dissolved in\r\nthe rain drops to a high degree of attenuation, its effects upon soils\r\nare highly salutary, as the nitrogen permeates the entire soil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF SEA WATER ON LEAD.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of the Chemical Society_ says that freshly cut strips of\r\nlead were kept in a bottle of sea water for four days, the bottle\r\nbeing frequently shaken.

JOY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of history that, as early as 1688, Denis Papin,\r\nProfessor of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Marburg,\r\nproposed to substitute steam for powder in the engine invented by\r\nHuyghens, and that in 1695 he published a description of several new\r\ninventions, in which steam played an important part. The Elector Carl,\r\nof Hesse-Cassel, was anxious to be free from the annoyances and\r\nimpositions practised upon his boatmen by the authorities at Münden,\r\nand he proposed to avoid that city by constructing a canal connecting\r\nthe Weser with the river that flowed through Cassel. Much of the work\r\nwas accomplished, and the half finished line of the canal can be\r\ntraced even at the present day. Papin was authorized to build a\r\npowerful steam pump by which the supply of water was to be regulated.\r\nA working model of this pump was completed; and the Elector was on the\r\npoint of visiting the laboratory to witness its operation, when a\r\nfearful explosion frightened the workmen, and afforded an opportunity\r\nfor enemies to intrigue for the expulsion of Papin from the country.\r\nThe model was preserved for a long time in Cassel; but at the time of\r\nthe French invasion, it disappeared, and no trace of it has since been\r\nfound. In writing about his inventions, Papin says, in 1695: \"It would\r\noccupy too much space for me to describe in what manner this principle\r\ncould be applied to removing water from mines, throwing bombs, sailing\r\nagainst the wind, and for many other similar purposes; everyone\r\naccording to his wants can imagine the constructions that could be\r\nmade. I cannot, however, refrain from remarking how much preferable\r\nthis power would be to oars for those whose business calls them to the\r\nsea.\" And further on he says: \"The steam cylinders could be employed\r\nfor a great variety of purposes.\" One of the cylinders, which was to\r\nform a part of the pump, was cast at the foundry in Cassel, and after\r\nvarious vicissitudes has finally become the property of the Historical\r\nMuseum in that city, where it will be preserved, with jealous care,\r\nfrom any further injury. During the recent exhibition of philosophical\r\ninstruments in London, this remnant of Papin's invention played an\r\nimportant part, it having been generously loaned by the authorities\r\nfor that occasion. After the flight of Papin from Germany, the\r\ncylinder was used as a receptacle for iron turnings and borings in the\r\nroyal works; and after the destruction of those works by fire, it came\r\ninto the possession of Henschel, the founder of one of the most\r\nextensive locomotive works in Germany. This man fully appreciated the\r\nvalue of the historical relic; and when I visited him at the works,\r\ntwenty-five years ago, he pointed out with pride to me the inscription\r\non its side, \"Papin's Cylinder,\" and said that he intended to have it\r\nplaced upon a solid pedestal near the gate. His grandson has since\r\npresented it to the city, and its preservation from destruction or\r\nsale is now secured. A copy of the drawing made by Papin of the pump\r\nof which this cylinder was to form a part, and which was published in\r\n1695, has recently appeared in Dingler's _Journal_, and I send it to\r\nyou, hoping that you will have it engraved and perpetuated in your\r\nvaluable paper. It is a peculiar combination of Savery's invention and\r\nPapin's piston engine, suggested for another purpose, and is a decided\r\nimprovement on Huyghens' powder engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPIN'S STEAM ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nA is the boiler for the generation of the steam, provided with a\r\nsafety valve (an invention of Papin). On opening the stopcock, C, the\r\nsteam passes through B into the cylinder, D, and by its expansion\r\ndrives the plunger, E, against the water contained in the cylinder, D,\r\nwhich is thus forced into the chamber, F, compressing strongly the\r\nair, which in turn expels the water through the pipe, G, to the height\r\ndesired. K is a funnel for the fresh supply of water, and at I and H\r\nare valves opening upwards and downwards. After the condensation of\r\nthe steam in D, a renewed supply of water, through K, forces the\r\nplunger, E, to the top of the cylinder, ready for the next action of\r\nsteam. The strokes of such a pump could not be frequent, and it would\r\nnot compare very favorably with the wonderful machinery exhibited in\r\nPhiladelphia last summer; but it contains the germ of the idea, and is\r\nworthy of all honor. Having often seen it stated that Papin had\r\ninvented a steamboat, I resolved during a recent visit to Germany to\r\ninvestigate the matter, and especially to search for the\r\ncorrespondence between Papin and Leibnitz in the library at Hanover.\r\nIt will be borne in mind that two hundred years ago, on December 4,\r\n1676, Leibnitz was appointed to take charge of the library in Hanover,\r\nand that he remained in this position until his death in 1716. He\r\nbequeathed his manuscripts to the library; and as he had the habit of\r\nwriting upon all manner of loose scraps of paper, it has cost much\r\nlabor to assort and classify them.\r\n\r\nOn making my application to the librarian to be permitted to see the\r\ncorrespondence between Papin and Leibnitz, my request was at once\r\ngranted; and a table having been assigned me, I was able to examine\r\nthese precious relics at my leisure. I was also shown a copy of an\r\noriginal treatise on the steam engine by Papin, which contained\r\nnumerous marginal notes by Leibnitz. In one place, Leibnitz criticized\r\nPapin's method for condensing steam, and makes a drawing on the\r\nmargin, showing a piston and valve which he thought would be more\r\npractical. It is somewhat remarkable that the Germans have not caused\r\na fac-simile of this little volume to be published. After considerable\r\nsearch, I found a copy of the original letter addressed by Papin to\r\nLeibnitz in 1707, asking Leibnitz to assist him in obtaining the\r\nconsent of the Hanoverian Government to navigate the river Weser with\r\na sidewheel steamboat. The letter was dated July 7, 1707, and\r\ncontained among other interesting passages the following sentence:\r\n\"The new invention will enable one or two men to accomplish more\r\neffect than several hundred oarsmen.\" It is evident that Leibnitz was\r\ndeeply impressed by Papin's letter, and he supported the simple and\r\nreasonable request contained in it by the following petition addressed\r\nto the Councillors of State. This communication from Leibnitz bears\r\ntwo indorsements, one by the clerk of the council, \"_pro memoria_\r\nrespectfully, in reference to the passage of a ship from the river\r\nFulda into the Weser;\" the other is in the handwriting of Leibnitz:\r\n\"Papin's sidewheel ship.\" This last indorsement is of great value, as\r\nindicating the fact that Papin proposed to apply side wheels for the\r\npropulsion of his new invention. The following is a translation of\r\nLeibnitz' letter, the original of which I saw in the library:\r\n\r\n\"Dionysius Papin, Councillor and Physician to his royal highness the\r\nElector of Cassel, also Professor of Mathematics at Marburg, is about\r\nto dispatch a vessel of singular construction down the river Weser to\r\nBremen. As he learns that all ships coming from Cassel, or any point\r\non the Fulda, are not permitted to enter the Weser, but are required\r\nto unload at Münden, and as he anticipates some difficulty, although\r\nthose vessels have a different object, his own not being intended for\r\nfreight, he begs most humbly that a gracious order be granted that his\r\nship may be allowed to pass unmolested through the electoral domain,\r\nwhich petition I most humbly support.\r\n\r\n  G.W. LEIBNITZ.\r\n  \"Hanover, July 13, 1707.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was returned to Leibnitz with the following indorsement:\r\n\"The Electoral Councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of\r\ngranting the above petition, and, without giving their reasons, have\r\ndirected me to inform you of their decision, and that in consequence\r\nthe request is not granted by his Electoral Highness.\r\n\r\n  H. REICHE.\r\n  \"Hanover, July 25, 1707.\"\r\n\r\nThis failure of Papin's petition was the deathblow to his effort to\r\nestablish steam navigation. A mob of boatmen, who thought they saw in\r\nthe embryo ship the ruin of their business, attacked the vessel at\r\nnight and utterly destroyed it. Papin narrowly escaped with his life,\r\nand fled to England, where he endured great hardships and poverty, and\r\nall traces of him were soon lost, so that it is uncertain in what\r\ncountry he finally died or where he was buried.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable man was driven out of France on account of his\r\nProtestant faith, and found a refuge in Germany; here he was again\r\npersecuted on account of the injury that ignorant and jealous people\r\nbelieved his inventions would inflict upon the industries of the\r\ncountry; and when the climax of steam engines for pumping water and\r\npropelling ships was reached, the enlightened government of the period\r\n\"found serious obstacles\" in the way of granting him protection, and,\r\nwithout condescending to state what those \"objections\" were, secretly\r\ninstigated the mob to make an end of the trouble. It is another\r\ninstance, unfortunately too often repeated in history, of the mischief\r\nmen dressed up in a little brief authority can work upon their\r\ngeneration. If Papin had been permitted to navigate the Weser with his\r\nship, and to carry it to London, as was his intention, it is possible\r\nthat we should have had steamboats one hundred years earlier than they\r\nwere given to us by Fulton. The plan proposed by Papin was highly\r\nimpracticable; but a knowledge of what Savery had done in the way of\r\nsteam machinery, aided by the shrewd suggestions of Leibnitz, combined\r\nwith the practical assistance of Englishmen, would, no doubt, have\r\nenabled him to improve upon his invention until it had obtained\r\nsufficient credit to be secure against the misfortune of being\r\ntotally forgotten. After the lapse of 100 years from the date of\r\nPapin's invention, when the first steamboat was put upon the river\r\nRhine, the vessel was fired into by concealed marksmen on shore, and\r\nnavigation was more dangerous than it is now on the upper waters of\r\nthe Missouri in times of Indian hostility. It was only after\r\nstationing troops along the banks of the river to protect the boatmen\r\nthat the government, fortunately more enlightened than in the days of\r\nLeibnitz, was able to establish steam navigation on a secure footing.\r\n\r\nI have thought it worth while to make this contribution to the history\r\nof steam navigation, particularly as I have been able to authenticate\r\na portion of it by reference to original documents.\r\n\r\nColumbia College, New York city, January, 1877.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPEAKING TELEGRAPH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore given accounts of the wonderful success of\r\nProfessor Bell in transmitting the vibrations of the human voice by\r\nelectrical means over a telegraph wire. He has lately made\r\nimprovements in his method of transmission, by which he dispenses with\r\nthe use of the battery, and substitutes the magneto-electric plan of\r\nproducing the current. The Boston _Transcript_ describes a recent\r\nexperiment with the new apparatus, by which conversation and singing\r\nwas successfully carried on between Boston and Malden, a distance of\r\nsix miles. The telephone, in its present form, consists of a powerful\r\ncompound permanent magnet, to the poles of which are attached ordinary\r\ntelegraph coils of insulated wire. In front of the poles, surrounded\r\nby these coils of wire, is placed a diaphragm of iron. A mouthpiece to\r\nconverge the sound upon this diaphragm substantially completes the\r\narrangement. As is well known, the motion of steel or iron in front of\r\nthe poles of a magnet creates a current of electricity in coils\r\nsurrounding the poles of the magnet, and the duration of this current\r\nof electricity coincides with the duration of the motion of the steel\r\nor iron moved or vibrated in the proximity of the magnet. When the\r\nhuman voice causes the diaphragm to vibrate, electrical undulations\r\nare induced in the coils environing the magnets, precisely analogous\r\nto the undulations of the air produced by that voice. These coils are\r\nconnected with the line wire, which may be of any length, provided the\r\ninsulation be good. The undulations which are induced in these coils\r\ntravel through the line wire, and, passing through the coils of an\r\ninstrument of precisely similar construction at the distant station,\r\nare again resolved into air undulations by the diaphragm of this\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe experiments were as follows: Telephones having been connected with\r\nthe private telegraphic line of the Boston Rubber Shoe Company,\r\nconversation was at once commenced. Stationed at the Boston end of the\r\nwire, Professor Bell requested Mr. Watson, who was at the Malden end,\r\nto speak in loud tones, with a view of enabling the entire company at\r\nonce to distinguish the sounds.\r\n\r\nThis was so successful that a smile of mingled pleasure and surprise\r\nplayed on the features of those present. That it, however, might not\r\nbe supposed that loud speaking was essential to intelligibility, Mr.\r\nBell explained that soft tones could be heard across the wires even\r\nmore distinctly than loud utterances, even a whisper being audible. In\r\nconfirmation of this statement, Mr. Watson commenced speaking in turn\r\nwith each member of the company; and after the efficiency of this\r\nmethod had been proved to the satisfaction of all, he took up a\r\nnewspaper and informed the assemblage that gold had closed the\r\nprevious evening at New York at 105-5/8. As there were quite a number\r\nof business men present, the effect that this practical demonstration\r\nof the value of the telephone produced can scarcely be exaggerated.\r\nOther passages from the daily journals were then given, and by this\r\ntime the desire for conversation having become general, Mr. Watson was\r\nplied with questions such as: \"Is it thawing or freezing at Malden?\r\nWho will be the next President?\" etc. It was remarkable that Mr.\r\nWatson was able to distinguish between the voices at the Boston end,\r\nhe calling at least one gentleman by name as soon as the latter\r\ncommenced speaking.\r\n\r\nThis went on for some time, until a lady at the Malden end sent the\r\ncompany an invitation to lunch per telephone, and an appropriate\r\nresponse was made by the same medium. At length the Boston company\r\nwere requested to remain quiet while a lady at the other end conveyed\r\nto them the sweet strains of music. The assemblage thereupon listened\r\nwith rapt attention while a young lady commenced singing \"The Last\r\nRose of Summer.\" The effect was simply charming. The sound of the\r\nvoice penetrated into the Boston end of the telephone with a\r\ndistinctness equal to that attainable in the more distant parts of a\r\nlarge concert room, and a unanimous vote of thanks was sent by the\r\nhandy little instrument which had procured for the assemblage so\r\nagreeable an hour.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe superb steam engine built by C.H.

He\r\napplied to the engineer of the Brooklyn bridge for permission to cross\r\nthe East river on a wire, three quarters of an inch in diameter, which\r\nhangs between the two towers. He was refused permission; but he\r\nfinally saw the president of the company, who granted his request.\r\nArriving at the appointed time, the engineer, Mr. Farrington, said:\r\n\"Well, sir; whenever you're ready, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"All ready, said I, as bold as brass outside, and as nervous as the\r\nEndorian witch on the inside. He walked on and I followed, when,\r\nHorror of Horrors--capital H's--to both Horrors--instead of leading me\r\nto the 'cradle,' which I called a raft, he took me to a little square\r\nboard held up by two crossed iron arms, called a 'buggy.' It was about\r\nthree feet square, and depended from the 'traveler,' a three quarter\r\ninch wire which crosses the river, and is run from tower to tower over\r\napparatus, by means of a stationary engine. It was too late to back\r\nout, but I didn't feel exactly prepared to plunge in. He did.\r\n\r\n\"He jumped in, and the little buggy swung from side to side, precisely\r\nas a swing does when you jump on the board and try to steady it by the\r\nropes. I looked at him, at the scale--that's it; it's exactly like a\r\npair of scales, with one scale--at the deep depths below us, and at\r\nmyself. I imagined the ticklish thrill which would permeate my body\r\nwhen we started. I fancied the glories of the prospective perspective\r\nbefore me.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, hurry up, please,' interrupted Farrington, and with\r\nresignation I hurried down. He stood up. I crouched down. Perhaps you\r\nthink you'd have stood up as he did. You're mistaken. I crouched down\r\nand held on tight. Make no mistake. I held on tight and waited for my\r\nthrill. It didn't come. Then I stood up, and Farrington gave the word\r\n'Go.' 'Wouldn't you better take a rope along?' said one of the men.\r\n'Yes, I think I would.' What did he want of a rope? He feared I would\r\nbe nervous. He meant to grapple me in the middle of the river, and tie\r\nme in. I knew it. I felt it. But I didn't say a word.\r\n\r\n\"With a gentle jerk we started--slow, slow, very slow. Farrington\r\nstood in front and watched the wire. I stood behind and watched\r\nmyself. I felt nothing. I was'n't exhilarated. I was'n't scared. I\r\nwas'n't even timid. I can't look from the top of a house without\r\ndesiring to jump off, but I looked down from the buggy and hadn't the\r\nleast desire to jump. Farrington says: 'It's because it's so high up.'\r\nWell, we went on without any special sensation till the buggy struck\r\nagainst a stay rope which reaches from one of the cables to the tower.\r\nIn the effort to free the buggy, Mr. Farrington gave a push which\r\nswung us out some little distance and back again, at which a little\r\npiece of indigestion seemed to be monarch of my interior, and for a\r\nmoment I was on the verge of a sensation. Having passed the middle,\r\nthe ascent was more labored. I waved my handkerchief to the people on\r\nthe ferryboats. I looked out toward the sea. I looked up at the\r\nheavens. I even looked toward Harlem, but, like the buyer in the\r\nBible, I said: 'It is naught, it is naught.'\r\n\r\n\"In about eight minutes we touched the New York side--all but ten\r\nfeet. The red flag waved for the engine to stop. There we hung in\r\nmid-air 275 feet above the level, swinging to and fro like a drunken\r\nbuggy, at an angle of forty degrees, and quite uneasy. The rope which\r\nwas to haul us on was fastened to the iron--blest be the tie that\r\nbinds--and with a few hearty pulls we were brought so near the New\r\nYork tower that without difficulty we clambered up. I had made the\r\ntrip, but I had not felt a feel. From the top of the New York tower I\r\nsaw much, but the chief point of interest was the innumerable jets of\r\nsteam which flourish in the air, and fantastically curl off into\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\"Again the steeples, the tower, and the long, narrow, dirty river\r\nfilled the prospect, and the bright sun of a charming day lightened up\r\nthe western sky That was all, except to say 'thanks and good-bye,' and\r\ndescend the stairs. There were 417 of them stairs, and before I\r\nreached the bottom I was dizzy, faint, seasick, and filled with a\r\ndecoction of tickle, so that I had to shut my eyes and rest from my\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\n\"Thus ends the trip which filled my anticipatory imagination as the\r\nwaters fill the sea, but which resolved itself in realization to a\r\nsimple, childlike faith in the fixtures on the wire, and in the skill\r\nand competence of the man who guided them.

See for\r\nexample how one of our evening dailies, tossing the dogmas of\r\nso-called science contemptuously aside, evolves such profoundly\r\noriginal thoughts as these, to explain the lucid blue glass theory of\r\nGeneral Pleasonton: \"The blue glass presents an obstruction to the\r\nsun's rays which can only be penetrated by one of the seven primary\r\nrays--the blue ray; the remaining six rays, travelling with the\r\nvelocity of 186,000 miles a second, falling upon the blue glass, are\r\nsuddenly arrested; the impact evolves upon the surface of the glass\r\nfriction, heat, electricity and magnetism; the heat expands the\r\nmolecules of the glass, and a current of electricity and magnetism\r\npasses through it into the room; this current, falling upon animal or\r\nvegetable life within, stimulates it to unusual vigor. Certainly the\r\nresults achieved, and abundantly certified to, are marvellous, and\r\nsufficient to provoke further experiments and inquiry.\" Prior to these\r\nsplendid original discoveries of our contemporary, we ignorantly\r\nbelieved that blue glass only partially sifted out the orange and\r\nyellow rays from the spectrum, and that with this exception, it acted\r\nmerely as a screen to diminish the intensity of all the rays. We also\r\nsupposed that there was a sharp distinction to be drawn between\r\nsunlight after passing through blue glass and the blue spectral ray:\r\nthat in one case all the colored rays were more or less present, and\r\nthat in the other but one was. But think of the utter dismay of such\r\npretenders as Helmholtz, Tyndall, and Henry when they learn that the\r\nundulatory theory of light with which they have so long taxed our\r\ncredulity is overthrown--that of the seven primary rays, six bounce\r\noff from blue glass and distribute themselves over the adjoining\r\nneighborhood. That the glass is heated by the impact; and as the sun\r\npersistently emits more rays, there are more impacts and more heat.\r\nThe glass gets hotter and hotter; but--mark the scientific acumen\r\nhere--just as we are wondering whether it will reach the melting\r\npoint, the pores open. It is the Turkish bath of Nature. Electricity\r\nand magnetism, no longer shut out, rush in between the separate\r\nmolecules. Hand in hand, these great curative powers seek a proper\r\nsubject. They meet (we learn from a report, also in our contemporary,\r\nof Pleasonton's latest triumph) a pig or a young lady whose hair has\r\ncome out--a heifer, a rooster, or a rheumatic child. Forthwith the pig\r\nfattens, hair equal to that produced by the finest _tricopherus_\r\npervades the female scalp, and \"unusual vigor\" and general happiness\r\nprevail. Such is the boon which Pleasonton bestows on humanity, as\r\nelucidated by the original genius of our contemporary.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE PROPAGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the alarming prevalence of scarlet fever in many parts of\r\nthe country, the following hints by the _British Medical Journal_ are\r\nwholesome warnings: \"There are three common ways by means of which\r\ninfectious diseases may be very widely spread. It is a very usual\r\npractice for parents to take children suffering from scarlet fever,\r\nmeasles, etc., to a public dispensary, in order to obtain advice and\r\nmedicines. It is little less than crime to expose, in the streets of a\r\ntown and in the crowded waiting room of a dispensary, children\r\nafflicted with such complaints. Again, persons who are recovering from\r\ninfectious disorders borrow books out of the lending departments of\r\npublic libraries; these books, on their reissue to fresh borrowers,\r\nare sources of very great danger. In all libraries, notices should be\r\nposted up informing borrowers that no books will be lent out to\r\npersons who are suffering from diseases of an infectious character;\r\nand that any person so suffering will be prosecuted if he borrow\r\nduring the time of his illness. Lastly, disease is spread by tract\r\ndistributors. It is the habit for such well meaning people to call at\r\na house where a person is ill and to leave him a tract. In a week or\r\nso the tract is called for again, another left in its place, and the\r\nold one is left with another person. It needs not much imagination to\r\nknow with what result to health such a practice will lead if the first\r\nperson be in scarlet fever or smallpox.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hutton offers \"a warning on the reckless manner in which parents\r\nallow their healthy children to run into the houses of acquaintances\r\nwho have members of their families suffering from scarlatina, etc.,\r\nand states that he has seen the infection thus carried from the\r\npatient, and several families attacked.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOUGHENED GLASS MAKING IN BROOKLYN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA _World_ reporter has lately visited the works in Brooklyn where the\r\nmanufacture of the La Bastie toughened glass is now in active\r\nprogress. The manufacturer states that, in June last, his factory was\r\ndestroyed by fire, and the introduction of the glass into our markets\r\nhas for that reason been delayed. Only one kind of goods, lamp\r\nchimneys, are now made, and the process is as follows: A workman,\r\nhaving in his hand a pole about eight feet long, with a knob on the\r\nend of the size of a lamp burner, fits a chimney on the knob and\r\nplunges it into the flame of a furnace. He with-draws it twice or\r\nthrice that it may not heat too quickly, turning the pole rapidly the\r\nwhile, and when the glass reaches a red heat quickly shoots it into\r\none of a dozen small baths fixed on a revolving table, and seizes\r\nanother chimney. A boy keeps the revolving table always in position,\r\nand as the chimneys come around to him, having been the proper time in\r\nthe bath, he takes them out to be dried, sorted, cleaned, and packed.\r\nThe bath has to be of just the right temperature, as, if it be too hot\r\nor too cold, the chimneys are liable to explode. In either case the\r\nprocess of annealing is imperfect. By working the tables at a certain\r\nrate, the baths are kept at the right temperature by the immersion of\r\nthe red hot glass. Oil or tallow is used in the bath. Any greasy\r\nsubstance will do, though tallow has proved most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nM. De la Chapelle, the manufacturer, states that he has already sold\r\n$150,000 worth of the chimneys. The toughened chimneys are about 60\r\nper cent dearer than those of ordinary glass. The factory is in\r\nDelavan street, Brooklyn, N.Y.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALEXANDER BAIN, ELECTRICIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ingenious man, whose inventions in connection with the electric\r\ntelegraph entitle his name to be held in grateful remembrance, died in\r\nJanuary last at the new Home for Incurables at Broomhill,\r\nKirkintilloch, near Glasgow, Scotland, and on Saturday his remains\r\nwere interred in the burying ground in the neighborhood of that town\r\nknown as the Old Aisle Cemetery. Mr. Bain, who was about sixty-six\r\nyears of age, was a native of Thurso. He was the inventor of the\r\nelectro-chemical printing telegraph, the electro-magnetic clock, and\r\nof perforated paper for automatic transmission of messages, and was\r\nauthor of a number of books and pamphlets relating to these subjects.\r\nSir William Thomson, in his address to the Mathematical Section of the\r\nBritish Association at its meeting in Glasgow last year, said: \"In the\r\nUnited States Telegraphic Department of the Great Exhibition at\r\nPhiladelphia, I saw Edison's automatic telegraph delivering 1,015\r\nwords in 57 seconds. This was done by the long neglected\r\nelectro-chemical method of Bain, long ago condemned in England to the\r\nhelot work of recording from a relay, and turned adrift as needlessly\r\ndelicate for that.\" Mr. Bain was stricken by paralysis, and suffered\r\nfrom complete loss of power in the lower limbs. For some time he had\r\nreceived a pension from the government, obtained for him, we believe,\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Sir William Thomson. Mr. Bain was a\r\nwidower, and has left a son and daughter, the former of whom is in\r\nAmerica, and the latter at present on the Continent. Photographs of\r\nhim by Mayall were recently presented to the Society of Telegraph\r\nEngineers and the American Society of Telegraphers at Philadelphia.\r\n--_The Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-RELIANCE NECESSARY TO SUCCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-reliance, conjoined with promptitude in the execution of our\r\nundertakings, is indispensable to success. And yet multitudes live a\r\nlife of vacillation and consequent failure, because they remain\r\nundetermined what to do, or, having decided that, have no confidence\r\nin themselves. Such persons need to be assured; but this assurance can\r\nbe obtained in no other way than by their own successes in whatever\r\nthey may attempt for themselves. If they lean upon others, they not\r\nonly become dissatisfied with what they achieve, but the success of\r\none achievement, in which they are entitled to but partial credit, is\r\nno guaranty to them that, unaided, they will not fail in their very\r\nnext experiment.\r\n\r\nFor want of self-reliance and decision of character, thousands are\r\nsubmerged in their first essays to make the voyage of life.\r\nDisappointed and chagrined at this, they underestimate their own\r\ncapacities, and thenceforward, relying on others, they take and keep a\r\nsubordinate position, from which they rise, when they rise at all,\r\nwith the utmost difficulty. When a young man attains his majority, it\r\nis better for him, as a general rule, to take some independent\r\nposition of his own, even though the present remuneration be less than\r\nhe would obtain in the service of others. When at work for himself, in\r\na business which requires and demands foresight, economy, and\r\nindustry, he will naturally develop the strong points of his\r\ncharacter, and become self-reliant.\r\n\r\nA glance at the business men of any community will show who have and\r\nwho have not improved the opportunities of their earlier years. The\r\nformer transact their business with ease, promptitude, and profit.\r\nThey rely upon themselves, and execute what they have to do with\r\nenergy and dispatch. But those who shirked everything in their youth\r\nare compelled to rely on their clerks and salesmen for advice, and are\r\nnever ready to act when occasions of profit arise. Many parents commit\r\na lamentable error in this respect. They lead their children to\r\nbelieve that they can do nothing without the constant assistance of\r\ntheir superiors, and after awhile the child becomes impressed with\r\nthat idea. Fortunate will it be for him when he emerges from the\r\nparental roof, if he can at once acquire the self-reliance which has\r\nbeen kept down at home--otherwise he must necessarily fail in whatever\r\nindependent enterprise he undertakes; and in such a case, while the\r\nmisfortune is his own, the fault lies at the door of misjudging\r\nparents rather than at his own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING TO DO.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an old trick of despots, and a good one, to employ their\r\nsubjects. Why? To keep them out of mischief, Employed men are most\r\ncontented. There is no conspiracy. Men do not sit down and coolly\r\nproceed to concoct iniquity so long as there is plenty of pleasant and\r\nprofitable employment for body and mind. Work drives off discontent,\r\nprovided there is compensation in proportion to the amount of labor\r\nperformed. There must be a stimulant. God never intended a man should\r\nsweat without eating of the fruits of his labor--reaping a\r\nreward--more than he intended the idle man should revel in plenty and\r\ngrow gouty on luxuries. Industry is a great peacemaker--a\r\nmind-your-own-business citizen. Something to do renders the despairing\r\ngood-natured and hopeful--stops the cry of the hungry, and promotes\r\nall virtue. The best men are the most industrious; the most wealthy\r\nwork the hardest. They always find something to do. Do you ever wonder\r\nthat men of wealth do not \"retire\" and enjoy their substance? We know\r\nsome young men look forward with anticipation to the time of\r\n\"retiring.\" It is doubtful if a man should ever retire from business\r\nas long as he lives. We think we know men who, were they to abandon\r\nbusiness, would be ruined, not pecuniarily, but mentally--their lives\r\nwould be shortened. God never intended man's mind should become\r\ndormant. It is governed by fixed laws. Those laws are imperative in\r\ntheir exactions.\r\n\r\nSomething to do! \"Oh, if I had something to do!\" There are young men\r\nwho sigh for it, yet one thing they can do--that is, seek for a job.\r\nOnce found, provided it is an honest one, do not hesitate to perform\r\nit, even if it does not pay as well as you expected.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMONEYED MEN.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland _Herald_ said, twenty years ago, during a stringency of\r\nthe times, that moneyed men are the veriest cravens on earth: so\r\ntimid, that on the least alarm they pull their heads, turtle-like,\r\nwithin their shells, and, snugly housed, hug their glittering treasure\r\nuntil all fear is removed. The consequence is that a few days'\r\ndisturbance of the monetary atmosphere brings on a perfect dearth of\r\nnot only the precious metals, but even of paper money, their\r\nrepresentative. Moneyed men never adopt the tactics of mutual support;\r\nhence, as soon as a shot is fired into the flock, they scatter, each\r\nlooking out for himself, each distrustful of the other, and each\r\nrecognizing only the great law of selfishness, which is to take care\r\nof number one. Courage has saved many an army, even when ammunition\r\nwas low; and many a foe has been scattered by one yell of defiance\r\nwhen there was not a cartridge left.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW BOOKS AND PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHOLOGY, OR THE SCIENCE OF GOVERNMENT. By S.V. Blakeslee. Price\r\n$1.25. New York and San Francisco: A. Roman & Co.\r\n\r\n    This book is a very metaphysical treatise on theories of\r\n    government and the duties of citizens to the law, each other,\r\n    and themselves. Theoretical politics are little in favor with\r\n    thinking men of this day; and the social difficulties of our age\r\n    will have to be solved by practical wisdom founded on\r\n    experience. The people that knows that a certain course of\r\n    legislation has destroyed an empire, and that a contrary policy\r\n    has developed one, will care little as to whether or not \"the\r\n    will controls the feelings by mediate and indirect force.\" We\r\n    are unable to find in this book any attempt to apply the finely\r\n    worded theories stated to practical use and popular instruction\r\n    in political science.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF ROOF TRUSSES, FOR THE USE OF ENGINEERS,\r\nARCHITECTS, AND BUILDERS. By Charles E. Greene, A.M., Professor of\r\nCivil Engineering in the University of Michigan. Chicago, Ill: George\r\nH. Frost.\r\n\r\n    The author of this work truly says that any designer who fairly\r\n    tries the graphical method will be pleased with the simplicity\r\n    and directness of the analysis, even for apparently complex\r\n    forms. The hindrance to the general use of the method is the\r\n    want of knowledge of the higher mathematics, which are largely\r\n    used in most treatises on the subject. Professor Greene has\r\n    avoided this stumbling block, and given us a treatise which may\r\n    be understood and appreciated by any one of common school\r\n    education. We therefore give his work a hearty commendation, and\r\n    we hope that every carpenter and builder may be induced to\r\n    analyze the stresses which affect the different parts of\r\n    structures, which he can readily do by carefully reading this\r\n    volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUB: a Journal devoted to the Carriage Building Trades. Published\r\nmonthly. Subscription price, $3.00 a year. New York city: The Hub\r\nPublishing Company, 323 Pearl street.\r\n\r\n    This journal is widely known for its accurate and extended\r\n    information as to carriage building, trimming, lining, painting,\r\n    etc.; and since its first issue it has maintained its\r\n    reputation, and given the public an immense amount of\r\n    instruction in a spirited and practical manner. The\r\n    illustrations and typography are excellent, and every number\r\n    shows how extended an area it serves as an authority on the\r\n    important industry to which it is devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSIGNATS AND MANDATS: the Money and the Finances of the French\r\nRevolution of 1789. By Stephen D. Dillaye. Price, free by mail, 30\r\ncents. Philadelphia, Pa.: Henry Carey Baird & Co., 810 Walnut street.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dillaye differs with the Hon. A.D. White, President of\r\n    Cornell University, as to the relative merits of money and\r\n    promises to pay money; and he begins with the assertion that the\r\n    President's \"object is to depreciate American credit, stability,\r\n    and honor.\" Further perusal, to ascertain the meaning of this\r\n    attack on a patriotic and useful member of society, shows us\r\n    what Mr. Dillaye thinks he means. He talks of credit being the\r\n    vital element of national power; and from this he argues that\r\n    the more \"credit\" a nation has--that is, the deeper it is in\r\n    debt--the more powerful it becomes. In short, he confuses credit\r\n    as opposed to discredit with credit as opposed to cash--a\r\n    grievous blunder, surely. A nation's credit is like a\r\n    merchant's; it becomes greater only as his debts become smaller;\r\n    and people trust a government for the same reason as they trust\r\n    an individual, mainly because every previous obligation has been\r\n    honorably observed. It is gratifying to know that persons of Mr.\r\n    Dillaye's way of thinking are few and unimportant, and their\r\n    number is diminishing daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROTON WATER SUPPLY FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK: an Address by George B.\r\nButler to the New York Municipal Society. New York city: Published by\r\nOrder of the Society, 87 Madison avenue.\r\n\r\n    A review of the whole subject of our water supply, its sources\r\n    and the area they drain, the geographical features of the\r\n    district, and the works erected by the city. Mr. Butler\r\n    maintains that the Croton valley, with proper storage\r\n    reservoirs, can abundantly supply the whole city; and that no\r\n    new aqueduct need be constructed in the present condition of the\r\n    public debt.\r\n\r\n\r\nEINE KURZE ALLGEMEINE EINLEITUNG ZU DEN AROMATISCHEN\r\nNITROVERBINDUNGEN. Von Peter Townsend Austen. Leipzig, Germany:\r\nWinter, Publisher.\r\n\r\n    We are glad to see that an American is able to publish a very\r\n    useful chemical treatise in Germany, the great head center of\r\n    chemistry. Dr. Austen, one of our most distinguished young\r\n    chemists in the field of original research, has produced a work\r\n    which bears the marks of much patient thought and study. The\r\n    book is dedicated to the renowned German chemist, Professor A.W.\r\n    Hofmann.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR YOUNG FOLKS' MAGAZINE: a Monthly Journal of Instruction and\r\nAmusement.

By Thomas Gaffield. Philadelphia,\r\nPa.: Benerman & Wilson.\r\n\r\n    There is much useful information in this little pamphlet, and\r\n    photographers especially should read it. The matter first\r\n    appeared in the Philadelphia _Photographer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AMERICAN AND FOREIGN PATENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW AGRICULTURAL INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GANG PLOW.\r\n\r\nEzra Peak, Montana, Kan.--This invention is so constructed that it may\r\nbe easily raised from and lowered to the ground, and adjusted to work\r\nat any desired depth in the ground. It is claimed to be of lighter\r\ndraft than plows constructed in the usual way, also to be simple in\r\nconstruction and inexpensive in manufacture. The wheels, the faces of\r\nwhich are notched to give them a slight up-and-down movement as they\r\nare drawn forward, slightly jar the plows, and thus cause them to be\r\neasier drawn than when smooth wheels are used. The shaft can be\r\nprovided with a ratchet wheel and pawl to hold it in any position into\r\nwhich it may be turned; and to it is attached a rope or chain, the\r\nother end of which, is attached to the forward end of the frame, so\r\nthat by turning the shaft the plows may be raised from, lowered to,\r\nand adjusted to work at any desired depth in the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED PLOW.\r\n\r\nJames Willis Hendley, Cedar Hill, N.C., assignor to David N. Bennett\r\nand Samuel T. Wright, of same place.--The objects here are simplicity\r\nand cheapness of construction, and such arrangement of parts as will\r\nprevent the plow becoming clogged with weeds, etc. The mold-board is\r\nwelded to the land side, or cast in one piece with it, so that no\r\nbrace or other connection is required between the mold-board and\r\nstandard; secondly, the curved beam is attached to the heel of the\r\nland-side and supported by a brace, which is bolted to the middle\r\nportion of the latter, and arranged in such relation to the mold-board\r\nthat a space is left between them, into which the trash will fall, and\r\nthus be drawn into the furrow and covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GRAIN DRILL.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Osborn, Parkville, Mich.--This is an improved attachment for\r\nseed drills, for gaging the depth at which the grain shall be\r\ndeposited in the earth. It consists in an adjustable spring gage bar\r\nattached to the shank of each drill tooth, whereby the teeth may be\r\nmade to enter the ground a greater or less depth. It is claimed to\r\nensure the planting of seeds at equal depth in hard or soft ground,\r\nand to diminish the draft.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED HORSE HAY RAKE.\r\n\r\nJoseph B. Wakeman and John L. Wager, Deposit, N.Y.--The construction\r\nof this implement is such that a large space is afforded beneath the\r\nrake head for the collection of hay. The pivots of said rake head back\r\nare also brought back, so that the teeth may be readily raised to\r\ndischarge the collected hay. By an ingenious lever arrangement the\r\ndriver is enabled to hold the rake to its work by the pressure of his\r\nfoot, and also readily to discharge the hay gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED BEE HIVE.\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Akins, Bridgeton, Pa.--In this hive, holes are bored in the\r\nsides of the compartment for ventilation, and windows are flared for\r\nthe purpose of inspecting the inside of the hive. A frame is used\r\nwhenever it is desired to have the honeycomb of any particular shape.\r\nIt consists of a form of tin or other suitable maternal, placed on a\r\nframe or slide, and having the shape required in the comb. Bees will\r\nbuild inside of the form, leaving about one fourth inch space between\r\nthe form and the comb. The tin sheet receives a portion of the refuse\r\nmatter, and can be readily taken out and cleaned. On the 1st of May\r\nthe bees are driven out into another hive and the frames examined.\r\nThree frames are taken out and set in a new box, and three empty\r\nframes are put in their place. The old queen must be put with the new\r\ncolony, and half of the bees must be put in each box and shut up, and\r\nput on a stand. The hives are to be opened the next morning. At the\r\nnext natural swarming time the swarms can be again divided. The hive\r\ncannot freeze, and it is proof against mice.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED PLOW STOCK.\r\n\r\nRobert Weber, New Ulm, Texas.--In this invention, by loosening a nut,\r\nthe point of draft attachment may be raised and lowered to cause the\r\nplow to work deeper or shallower in the ground, or turned to one or\r\nthe other side, to cause the plow to take or leave land, and may be\r\nsecured in place when adjusted by again tightening the nut.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COMBINED HAY TEDDER AND SIDE RAKE.\r\n\r\nJohn Huber and Henry Snell, Girard, Ill.--This machine may be used\r\nsimply for stirring up and turning the hay, or for turning the hay and\r\ngathering it into windrows. The shaft of a reel revolves in bearings\r\nattached to the side bars of the frame near their rear ends. To the\r\nbars of the reel are attached spring teeth, which, as the machine is\r\ndrawn forward, take hold of the hay, carry it up and over the reel,\r\nand drop it to the ground in the rear of the machine. A carrier takes\r\nthe hay from the teeth, when it has been brought to the top of the\r\nreel, carries it over the shaft, and discharges it into a trough, down\r\nwhich it slides, and is deposited in a windrow along one side of the\r\npath of the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GRUBBING MACHINE.\r\n\r\nIra Burley, Redwing, Minn.--This invention consists in the combination\r\nof wheels and axle, tongue, adjusting bar, adjustable brace, uprights,\r\ncross bar, two ropes, and four pulley blocks with each other. To the\r\nforward end of the tongue is attached a loop or clevis, to receive an\r\niron pin, to be driven into the ground to keep the machine from moving\r\nabout while being used. To the pulley block is swiveled a hook, to be\r\nhooked into a loop, attached to the forward end of a lever. The rear\r\nend of the lever passes through a slot in the upper end of a fulcrum\r\npost, and has a notch formed in its lower side to receive a bolt or\r\npin, attached to said post to serve as a fulcrum to said lever.\r\nSeveral notches are formed in the lever to receive the fulcrum bolt,\r\nto enable the position of the fulcrum post to be adjusted to regulate\r\nthe leverage, and as circumstances may require. To the lever is\r\nattached a strong clevis, to receive the hook of the chain, that is\r\nsecured to the stump to be pulled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SEED PLANTER.\r\n\r\nDaniel J. Davis, Red Boiling Springs, Tenn.--In this invention two\r\nwheels revolve upon the journals of the axle. Upon the end parts of\r\nthe axle are attached the rear ends of side bars, the forward ends of\r\nwhich are bolted to the outer sides of the forward ends of the plow\r\nbeams. The forward ends of the beams are bolted to the ends of the\r\nfront bar, to the center of which is secured the forward end of the\r\ncentral bar. To the beams are attached the plows for opening furrows\r\nto receive the seed as it passes from the conductor spouts. The lower\r\nends of the spouts or tubes pass in through the sides of the plows, so\r\nas to conduct the seed into the bottom of the furrows before they have\r\nbeen partially filled by the falling in of the soil. The dropping\r\nplate is concaved around its dropping holes, and is provided with a\r\nplate that may be adjusted to cover one set of dropping holes to drop\r\nthe hills twice as far apart as when both sets of holes operate.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED ANIMAL TRAP.\r\n\r\nThomas N. Hughes, Muddy Creek, Tenn.--This trap is for animals of all\r\nkinds, as rats, mice, and larger animals, as foxes, minks, coons,\r\netc., that are allured by bait, and is automatically set again by the\r\nanimal caught, to be ready for the next animal attracted by the bait.\r\nIt is divided by a longitudinal partition into two main sections, in\r\nwhich the working parts are disposed. The entrance at the end of one\r\nsection has a drop door, which is arranged back of the same, resting,\r\nwhen closed, on side strips in inclined position, and being supported\r\non an upright arm, of a centrally pivoted treadle door, at the bottom\r\nof the trap, when the trap is set. The treadle door is only required\r\nto swing sufficiently on its pivots to release the drop door from the\r\narm, suitable seats at the under side of the trap, at both sides of\r\nthe treadle door, preventing the door from swinging farther than\r\nnecessary. The bait is placed, in a grated receptacle, near the\r\ntreadle door, and entices the animal to pass in, so as to close the\r\ndrop door when it arrives at the part of the treadle door near the\r\nbait. The back end of this section is perforated or grated to admit\r\nlight, which attracts the frightened animal and induces him to pass\r\ntoward the light. The top part of the trap may be grated to admit air,\r\nand the glass door at the end made to slide, to admit the taking out\r\nof the animals for killing them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MISCELLANEOUS INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR THE HYDRATION OF CHLORINE GAS.\r\n\r\nWilliam Maynard, New York city.--This invention relates to an improved\r\nconstruction of apparatus for the hydration of gases, and more\r\nparticularly chlorine gas for the manufacture of chlorine water for\r\nuse in the industrial arts of bleaching, etc. It consists mainly in a\r\ncase having an inlet for the water above, an inlet for the gas below,\r\nand provided with an intermediate water percolating medium; combined\r\nwith a reservoir located below the level of the case and having a\r\nwater-sealed communication therewith, which reservoir receives the\r\nhydrated gases, and which water seal prevents the heavy gas in the\r\ncase from passing out through the bottom inlet. The case for the\r\npercolation of water and the absorption of the gas is made of conical\r\nshape, with the largest diameter at the bottom, to produce the\r\ngreatest absorption of the heavy gas when first admitted; while\r\nhorizontal partitions, or shelves, in said case are provided with\r\nupwardly projecting tubes which hold a permanent surface of water on\r\nthe said partition or shelves. The tubes permit, by their peculiar\r\nshape, the water to pass down on one side and the gas up on the\r\nopposite side of said tube, while their alternating arrangement in the\r\nalternating shelves gives a zigzag and long continued passage to the\r\ngas and water in moving in opposite directions through the case.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED PROCESS OF PREPARING GAS FUEL.\r\n\r\nMartin N. Diall, Terre Haute, Ind.--This inventor saturates wood by\r\nimmersing it in any hydrocarbon oil for from six to twelve hours, as\r\nrequired by the nature of the wood, so that it may take up the\r\nnecessary quantity of oil for the required strength of gas. The wood\r\nis then immersed in a bath of water, for taking up a quantity of water\r\noutside the oil, and is then charged in the retorts, the same as coal,\r\nand distilled in the same way. By this process the inventor claims\r\nthat he produces fixed gas equal to coal gas, much faster, and with\r\nless expense, the wood and water furnishing the hydrogen, and the oil\r\nfurnishing the carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FISHING LINE LEADER.\r\n\r\nWelmer T. Jahne and Anthony Moors, Jersey City, N.J.--This consists of\r\na leader made of spring wire, bent into V form, provided with a swivel\r\nand eye at its middle part, and with eyes or loops at its ends to\r\nreceive the line and snells. By this construction the snells and hooks\r\nwill be kept apart however the line maybe thrown, and however they and\r\nthe leader may be turned about by the tide or current. The device is\r\none well calculated to meet with a favorable reception from fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED ABDOMINAL CORSET.\r\n\r\nChristina Lascell, Newark, N.J.--The object of this invention is to\r\nfurnish an improved abdominal corset, which supports the weight of the\r\nabdomen in a perfectly comfortable and easy manner, and throws the\r\nstrain on the shoulders and hips of the wearer. The corset is\r\nadjustable to the varying conditions of the abdomen, does not\r\ninterfere with the motion and different positions of the body, and is\r\nreadily put on and taken off. It has adjustable elastic shoulder\r\nstraps, and opening at the sides by lacings and elastic bands and\r\nbuttons. The front part of the corset is stiffened by a stay that\r\nslides in a pocket to provide for stooping. A central front and lacing\r\nadmit the front part of the corset to expand. The lower extension part\r\nof the corset has short stiffening stays, and it is connected\r\nindependently of the upper stays by short side lacing and elastic\r\nstraps to the side or hip parts of the corset. A hernial band extends\r\nfrom the lowermost part of the corset-extension between the legs to\r\nthe rear, and is attached by adjustable hip straps to the sides of the\r\ncorset.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED FIRE ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Werner, New York city.--The terrible disaster in the Brooklyn\r\ntheater is serving as a stimulus to induce the invention of devices\r\nlooking to the prevention of a like occurrence. The present inventor\r\nhas devised a new fire escape for theaters, concert halls, and other\r\npublic places of amusement, by which the space at the upper parts of\r\nthe entrances, halls, or vestibules of the buildings is utilized for\r\nthe purpose of forming additional passage ways for the persons in the\r\nbuildings, to be used in case of fire for the more convenient and less\r\ndangerous exit of the same. The invention consists, mainly, of a\r\nmovable floor, suspended by chains, pulleys, and weights, near the\r\nceiling of the entrances, and lowered in case of fire. It is supported\r\non projecting rests of the side walls, at suitable height above the\r\nfloor. Sliding extensions and swinging stairs and rear sections\r\nconnect with the ground outside of the door, and with the staircases\r\nof the gallery, so as to form separate exits above the regular\r\nentrances.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED ELECTRO-MAGNETIC DENTAL PLUGGER.\r\n\r\nJames E. Dexter, New York city.--This invention consists, first, in a\r\nmagnet having a centrally bored iron core, surrounded by a magnetic\r\ncoil, which is enveloped by an iron shell that is concentric with the\r\ncentral core, and is attached to a flange formed on the lower end of\r\nthe said central core. One side of both shell and core are split for\r\nthe purpose of obviating residual magnetism. The invention also\r\nconsists in combining a spring yoke, a vibrator, and a spring contact\r\npiece, as hereinafter particularly described. The third part of this\r\ninvention consists in the arrangement of the key for completing the\r\ncircuit, which is made with an insulating exterior, and is provided\r\nwith one of the termini of the magnet coil, and bears against the side\r\nof the key to insure a constant contact of the surfaces. The various\r\nparts of the plugger are combined, so that pressing the key with the\r\nfinger makes the circuit, and a succession of regular strokes is\r\nproduced, the force of which may be varied by an adjusting screw.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW MECHANICAL AND ENGINEERING INVENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COTTON GIN.\r\n\r\nJoseph W. Thorn, Iuka, Miss., assignor to himself and M.W. Beardsley,\r\nof same place.--In this machine there is a new construction of the\r\nbrush drum for simplifying the same, and facilitating the application\r\nof the brush wings, so that they can be readily taken off and put on;\r\nalso, an arrangement of the ribs between the saws for facilitating the\r\nseparating of the seed from the cotton without breaking and injuring\r\nthe fiber. There are also ingenious devices for preventing the seed\r\nfrom gathering and clogging at the ends of the saw drum.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED SAFETY CHECK FOR ELEVATORS.\r\n\r\nNathan H. Fogg, Boston, Mass.--When the car is suspended normally from\r\nthe rope, the rubber balls, arranged in sockets near the lower part of\r\nthe car, are supported on their seats in a state of rest; but the\r\ninstant that the rope breaks or gets detached from the bolt the action\r\nof a spiral spring throws an actuating plate downward, and levers and\r\nball-carrying rods upward. The balls are thus thrown off their seats\r\nand wedged between the inclined sides of the pockets and the guide\r\nposts of the elevator so as to stop thereby the car.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COMBINATION LOCK.\r\n\r\nAchille Parise, Naples, Italy.--This is a new combination lock for\r\ndoors, trunks, safes, etc., that admits of a large number of\r\ncombinations, and may be opened and closed quickly. It consists of\r\nsliding tumbler plates, having longitudinal slots and a number of\r\nperforations placed at different relative positions to the slots of\r\neach tumbler. The trunks are connected by screw set pins attached to\r\nface slides, and passing through any one of the perforations,\r\nadmitting the setting of the tumblers and opening of the lock by outer\r\nprojections or buttons of the slides to fixed exterior guides.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED MACHINE FOR WIRING AND BINDING HATS.\r\n\r\nMari A. Cuming and Judson Knight, New York city.--This is a machine\r\nfor binding hats, felt skirts, and similar articles, by a uniform and\r\nparallel pressure on the rims, and by facilitating the applying and\r\ntaking off of the articles from the machine, and accomplishing the\r\ncutting of the binding or braid and wire in a reliable and improved\r\nmanner. Pressure rollers attach the binding and the wire, if one is\r\nrequired, in connection with a grooved gage that is supported on a\r\nseat of the shaft of the lower pressure roller. The wire is guided by\r\nannular recesses or chamferings at the rear circumference of the\r\npressure rollers and the groove of the gage. The gage is so connected\r\nto its seat that it may be turned and another guide groove of the same\r\nbe exposed to face the pressure rollers, so as to adapt the same for a\r\nvariety of work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBUSINESS AND PERSONAL\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Charge for Insertion under this head is One Dollar a line for\r\neach insertion.

I have\r\nnot discovered any defect in the way in which it was put on; it\r\nappears to be perfect. The pitch may be too low, and the rain may be\r\ndriven through by the wind on this account. Is there any wash, paint,\r\nor cement that might be used for the purpose of remedying this defect?\r\nA. There is an india rubber paint which is used to make leaky roofs\r\ntight, but we have not learned of its being applied to slate roofs.\r\n\r\n(2) C.C.B. says: I am making a small steam engine. The cylinder has,\r\ninside diameter, about 1 inch with 2½ inches stroke. What would be the\r\nmost suitable material and dimensions for the boiler? A. Make one 10\r\nor 12 inches in diameter and 18 inches high, of 1/8 inch iron. You can\r\ncarry 60 lbs. steam pressure.\r\n\r\n(3) M.C. says: I have had charge of some greenhouses that were erected\r\nabout four years ago; they are thoroughly heated, and all the pipes\r\nhave a thick coat of black paint. The houses never gave any\r\nsatisfaction, no matter how healthy the plants were in the fall. Soon\r\nafter the fires were lighted both leaves and flowers began to drop,\r\nand some plants died. My predecessors attributed it to gas getting\r\ninto the houses. Upon inquiry I found no gas was there except when the\r\npipes were hot, and that the hotter they were the worse it was. In my\r\nopinion, the cause of the trouble was a strong smell of paint from the\r\npipes. Since then I only keep heat enough to save the plants from\r\nfreezing. A. From your statement there is no doubt that the paint used\r\non the pipes was an imperfectly purified coal tar. Such tar contains a\r\ngreat number of hydrocarbons--naphtha, naphthalen, anthracen, phenol,\r\nseveral organic alkaloids, hydrosulphuric and hydrocyanic acids, etc.,\r\nall of which are more or less volatile at the temperature to which\r\nthey must have been subjected. These exhalations have proved fatal to\r\nplant life when in sufficient quantity. We do not know of a better\r\nremedy than that of removing the cause. Painting the pipes with a\r\nstrong solution of washing soda and lime would, in a measure, prevent\r\nthe escape of the most objectionable constituents into the air, by\r\nforming with them compounds non-volatile at any temperature to which\r\nthey are likely to be subjected in contact with the pipes; but the\r\nformer would be the surest plan.\r\n\r\n(4) C.D.W. asks: The roof of the new Illinois State House, as well as\r\nthe stylobate cornices and upper portion of the dome, are covered with\r\nzinc. It has been on about three years, and I am told is materially\r\naffected by oxidation. The theory is that zinc, though subject to\r\noxidization, has the peculiarity that the oxide does not scale off as\r\nfrom iron, but forms a permanent coating impervious to the action of\r\nthe atmosphere. Some mechanics, however, assert that neither zinc,\r\ncopper, nor lead will withstand the action of our atmosphere, as\r\nbituminous coal strongly impregnated with sulphur is almost the only\r\nfuel used. It is claimed by some that the sulphurous acid in the\r\natmosphere tends to corrode zinc so as to make it worthless for roofs\r\nor gutter linings. A. Are you sure that the roof and gutters in\r\nquestion are not of galvanized iron, iron coated with zinc? This is\r\nthe material most commonly used for that purpose at the present time.\r\nZinc has been found to be too brittle for the strain to which it is\r\nsubjected, in such cases, by the expansion and contraction induced by\r\nchanges of temperature. A slight oxidation will adhere to the surface,\r\nbut an acid deposit from the atmosphere will penetrate the coating in\r\npoints and deteriorate the metal.\r\n\r\n(5) N.J.S. says: I have a floor of ash and black walnut which has been\r\noiled with raw linseed oil once. How can I finish it so as to get a\r\nhard, smooth finish that will not be scratched by boot heels nor be\r\nsticky or retain the dirt as a waxed floor does? A. Oil raises the\r\nfiber of black walnut and gives it a rougher surface than when free\r\nfrom it. To polish any wood, it is only necessary to fill the pores\r\nwell, and then rub it down to a smooth surface. Thus painters prefer\r\nto put on a coat of shellac varnish first, before oiling walnut and\r\nother hard woods. For fine floors, a thin coat of liquid wax is\r\napplied as a finish.\r\n\r\n(6) A.J.S. asks: What is the best plan for putting up a cheap dry\r\nhouse of lumber, for drying (by steam) white oak, hickory, and other\r\nlumber used in wagon and buggy making? A. Make as tight a house as\r\npossible with tongued and grooved siding-boards, floors, roof, etc.,\r\nand provide a stack of steam pipe containing 1 foot of heating surface\r\nto every 50 cubic feet of air contained in the building. Set the steam\r\npipe in compact shape and enclose it with a casing of galvanized sheet\r\niron open at the top; supply cold air from outside of the building by\r\na boxed conduit to the bottom of this stack. The air when heated will\r\nrise and diffuse itself into the room, and as it cools will fall to\r\nthe floor; provide registers in the floor, through which it may escape\r\ninto other boxed tubes under the floor leading to an upright chimney\r\ndischarging above the roof. Let a smoke pipe from the boiler enter the\r\nchimney and extend up inside the flue far enough to heat the same. The\r\nchange of air is necessary to dry the lumber. The size of the house of\r\ncourse will depend upon the quantity of material required to be\r\nstacked up into it at any one time.\r\n\r\n(7) G. asks: 1. How do you calculate the amount of pipe of a given\r\nsize to warm a room of a given size? A. One square foot of plate or\r\npipe surface is generally taken as sufficient to heat about 70 cubic\r\nfeet of air in dwellings. 2. What allowance should be made for doors\r\nand windows? A. The said foot of surface will heat, in accordance with\r\nvarying conditions, from 40 to 100 cubic feet of air, and allowance\r\nshould be made for extra exposures, to correspond with that scale. A\r\nsteam pressure of 5 lbs. is sufficient for heating purposes. 3. What\r\nis meant by the terms direct and indirect radiation, in giving\r\ncapacity of steam generators for heating houses? A. Direct radiation\r\nis used when the pipes are located in the room, and indirect when they\r\nare located in a chamber in the cellar, to warm air which is conducted\r\nto the room by air pipes.\r\n\r\n(8) D.M. says: After reading L.S.W.'s reply to J.B.C., p. 75 (6), vol.\r\n36, I think the following demonstration will be more acceptable to\r\nJ.B.C.: Imagine three spheres of which the given circles are great\r\ncircles, and a plane tangent to the three spheres. Any two of the\r\nspheres may be conceived to have been generated by the revolution of\r\ntwo of the circles about the line joining their centers. During such\r\nrevolution, the lines tangent to the two circles describe a conical\r\nsurface. We have, therefore, three spheres and three conical surfaces.\r\nNow the plane, which is tangent to the three spheres, is also\r\nevidently tangent to the three conical surfaces; and therefore the\r\nvertices of those conical surfaces are all in the tangent plane. Now\r\nthose vertices are the points (1), (2), (3). But the same points are\r\nalso in the plane passing through the centers of the three spheres,\r\nwhich is the same with the plane of the paper on which the figure is\r\ndrawn. Those points, being in two planes at the same time, must\r\ntherefore be in the intersection of those planes, that is to say, in a\r\nstraight line.\r\n\r\n(9) C.W.H. asks: Can dyeing or coloring be done in cold water? A. Many\r\nof the coal tar colors may be used in this way: For animal\r\nfibers--wool, silk, | etc.--the affinity of these colors is so great\r\nthat, in most instances, no mordants are necessary. The baths are\r\nusually made slightly acid. With vegetable fibers, however, a fast dye\r\nis not assured without mordanting. Some of the finer goods are\r\nprepared by treating with steam coagulated albumen (animalizing),\r\ngelatin, various tannates, tin salt, alum, and other metallic salts.\r\nThe following is, the usual method of treatment, except with goods\r\nintended for very light shades: Pass the goods through a strong\r\ndecoction of sumac or other tannin solution for an hour, and\r\nafterwards for an hour or two through a weak solution of stannate of\r\nsoda; wring out, dip into a dilute solution of sulphuric acid, and\r\nrinse well in water. The goods are then ready to be passed through the\r\ncolor bath, slightly acidulated. For different tints, these baths are\r\nworked at different temperatures.\r\n\r\n(10) F.W. says: I wish to lay the face tier of a brick wall in black\r\nmortar. How can I make the coloring material and mix it? A. Some\r\nprefer to use red mortar and afterwards pencil the joints with black.\r\nColor the ordinary white mortar with Spanish brown for red mortar, and\r\nwith ivory black for black, by mixing in enough of the color in a\r\npowdered state to give a good deep tone.\r\n\r\n(11) H.A.S. asks: 1. How many prisms are required in a spectroscope to\r\ndetect mineral elements in presence of all the ash ingredients of\r\norganic bodies? A. If we understand you, one 60° prism will answer. 2.\r\nWhat is the best and cheapest form of apparatus to heat such compounds\r\nfor examination? A. Mix the substance with a little pure hydrochloric\r\nacid and glycerin, and introduce into the flame on a coil of platinum\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n1. Has soup prepared by dissolving meat bones in a Papin's digester\r\never been known to produce ossification of any of the soft tissues? A.\r\nWe have never heard of such a result. 2. Has it ever been known to\r\nproduce a new crop of teeth in toothless persons? A. We have no data\r\nas to such a fact.\r\n\r\nI have seen a statement that May 19, 1780, was so dark a day that\r\ncandles were necessary everywhere; and I have heard that another\r\noccurred about the year 1820. Has any scientific explanation ever been\r\ngiven of this phenomenon? A. The darkness on the days you mention were\r\nthe result of solar eclipses. They occurred on days of unusual\r\ncloudiness. Perhaps the darkest day in modern history was that caused\r\nby the total solar eclipse in the year 1806.\r\n\r\n(12) A.B. says: 1. I have built a boat 15 feet long and 4 feet 6\r\ninches wide. How large a boiler and engine do I require to work her to\r\nbest advantage? She is 22 inches deep from top of rail to top of keel.\r\nA. Cylinder, 2½ x 3 inches; boiler, 20 inches in diameter and 3 feet\r\nhigh. Propeller, 18 to 20 inches in diameter, and of 3 feet pitch. 2.\r\nHow fast ought she to run? A. Probable speed, 5 miles an hour in\r\nsmooth water.\r\n\r\n(13) L.L. asks: 1. Does it make any difference in what position a\r\nwatch is in when running? A. For watches adjusted to temperature and\r\nposition, it does not make much difference. 2. When not being carried,\r\nwhat position should it be left in? A. In the case of ordinary\r\nwatches, we imagine that the wear will be rather more uniform when\r\nthey are in a vertical position. 3. If a person sleeps in a cola room,\r\nwould a watch be better under his pillow than on a table or hung up in\r\nthe same room? A. It is best not to subject them to great changes of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\n(14) W.G. says, in reply to C.W.W., who has an engine, of 2-5/8 inches\r\nbore and 4 inches stroke, which runs slower with increase of pressure:\r\nHaving had much experience with small engines and boilers, I will\r\nstate that I have had the same difficulty when using an upright\r\ntubular boiler, and discovered the following to be the cause: The\r\nupper portions of the tube superheat the steam to such a degree as to\r\nprevent lubrication on the valve and piston surface by condensation,\r\nand thereby reduce the speed of engine. Even with increased pressure,\r\nthis effect will be more appreciable when the area and travel of slide\r\nvalve are in excess.\r\n\r\n(15) J.M.T. asks: Is there friction between two bodies while at rest,\r\nor only when one or both are in motion? A. Both when at rest and in\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nWhy does a balloon rise in the air? A. See p. 64, vol. 32.\r\n\r\n(16) S.J.S. asks: 1. How are augers twisted? A. By special machinery.\r\n2. How are twist drills made, and are they single or double grooved?\r\nA. They are double grooved or double twisted, and are cut out in a\r\nmilling machine.\r\n\r\nCan weights, springs, or water from a tank be used to any advantage to\r\nrun a lathe? A. No.\r\n\r\nHow much do iron and brass, in rods or bands, expand in length when\r\nheated to red heat? A. Iron about 1/8 inch per foot, brass 1/10 inch.\r\n\r\nIs the pressure of the air to be added to the weight of water in the\r\nbottom of a vessel in estimating the pressure on the bottom? A. No.\r\n\r\nDoes a watch or clock run faster when just wound up? A. No.\r\n\r\nIs it not moisture in the air that makes it heavier, and so affects\r\nthe barometer? A. Yes.\r\n\r\nIs the pressure in a siphon equal throughout, or is it greater in the\r\nupper end? A. Equal throughout.\r\n\r\nWill it take more power to run two millstones in opposite directions\r\nthan it will to run one at the same speed, the other being stationary?\r\nA. Yes, it will take double the power.\r\n\r\n1. How are common screws made? A. In lathes, with tools and dies. 2.\r\nHow can I make wooden screws perfectly smooth? A. By using keen tools.\r\n\r\nWhat is the simplest way of cutting a square hole in a bar of iron? A.\r\nDrill a round hole and square it out.\r\n\r\n(17) G.E.C. asks: Could I have a brick range 2×3 feet, built on a\r\nplatform about 1 foot from floor, with two compartments, to be heated\r\nwith petroleum, the lower one to be used as an oven, the upper one to\r\nhave a stove top to set cooking utensils on, and have a ventilating\r\npipe run from each compartment of the oil receptacles into the place\r\nin the chimney where the stove pipe usually goes, to carry away any\r\ngas or smoke? I want the oil receptacles to be arranged to be drawn\r\nout, to be filled and trimmed, and I would like four burners to heat\r\nan oven 22 inches square, as hot as the same oven could be heated with\r\nwood. A. We doubt the propriety or the economy of substituting oil for\r\nwood, but something may be done to make the atmosphere of kitchens\r\nmore endurable in summer, and permanently so in warm climates. A\r\ndouble faced range could be made and set in the center of the\r\nthickness of the chimney, with the space above the top of it open to\r\nthe exterior of the house; a very slight structure, simply having a\r\ngood floor and roof and open around the sides, and built against the\r\nchimney as an extension to the house, would answer for a summer\r\nkitchen, while the ordinary kitchen inside the house could be used in\r\nwinter. The transposition could be made by a pair of iron sliding\r\ndoors shutting off the kitchen not in use; and these doors could be\r\ntransferred from one side of the chimney to the other when the change\r\nof season required it.\r\n\r\n(18) A.X.A. says: In your issue of December 2 is a recipe in which\r\n\"insoluble acid chromate of lime,\" and gelatin are to be used; and in\r\na succeeding number of your paper the modes of preparing the insoluble\r\nacid are given. I have made the acid according to your directions, but\r\nthe result of my manipulation of the recipe is a failure. You say:\r\n\"Take of insoluble acid chromate of lime one part, and of gelatin five\r\nparts;\" but you do not say what further is to be done. Will the acid\r\ndissolve the gelatin, or must warm water be added? In my experiment\r\nthe acid would not dissolve the gelatin, and I had to add considerable\r\nwarm water before it would do so. A. Dissolve the bichromate of lime\r\nin the smallest possible quantity of warm water, and filter; then add\r\nthe gelatin, previously softened by immersion in cold water. Heat the\r\nmixture over a water bath until the gelatin is completely dissolved,\r\nstir well, and use while hot. The recipe should have stated that this\r\ncement was best suited for glassware. The bichromate of potash or of\r\nammonia will answer nearly as well as the lime salt.\r\n\r\n(19) E.C.N. asks: How must a stove be constructed to burn pea coal,\r\nfor heating outbuildings? Is there any way of constructing a draught\r\nbelow the grate of any common heating stove, sufficiently strong to do\r\nwithout an extra long chimney? A. Use a broad grate to spread the coal\r\nout well, so as to avoid the necessity of heaping it up much; make the\r\nopening for the draft some distance below the grate, and regulate by\r\nthe usual slide dampers in the lower and upper doors.\r\n\r\nMINERALS, ETC.--Specimens have been received from the following\r\ncorrespondents, and examined, with the result stated:\r\n\r\nF.R.R.S.--The substance you send is carbonate of iron. It is held in\r\nsolution in the water by the large excess of carbonic acid which the\r\nwater contains. On boiling the water the carbonic acid gas is expelled\r\nand the iron salt is precipitated from solution. The removal of this\r\nand some other objectionable salts which the water very probably\r\ncontains, may be removed by the addition of the proper quantity of\r\nclear lime water to it--the lime in this instance will combine with\r\nthe excess of carbonic acid and fall to the bottom together with the\r\ncarbonate of iron. To determine the precise quantity of lime water\r\nrequisite, add the reagent (saturated solution) to a small portion (of\r\nknown volume) of the freshly drawn water, in small quantities at a\r\ntime, and with constant stirring until no further precipitate forms.\r\nThen by a simple operation in proportion the quantity of the reagent\r\nnecessary for the purification of a given quantity of the well water\r\nmay be easily determined. An excess of the reagent must be avoided.\r\nThis impurity would probably prevent the successful working of an\r\ninjector.\r\n\r\nW.S.W. asks: How is the best rosin, used on violin bows,\r\nprepared?--W.F. asks: What is a simple method for washing clay for\r\nbrick and tile making?--E.S.D. asks: What is the best kind of wood to\r\nconstruct a guitar?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN acknowledges, with much\r\npleasure, the receipt of original papers and contributions upon the\r\nfollowing subjects:\r\n\r\n  On Rheumatism.

All such questions,\r\nwhen initials only are given, are thrown into the waste basket, as it\r\nwould fill half of our paper to print them all; but we generally take\r\npleasure in answering briefly by mail, if the writer's address is\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHundreds of inquiries analogous to the following are sent: \"Who sells\r\na tool for truing up a crosshead wrist? Who sells tools for refitting\r\nsteam valves without unscrewing them from the pipes? Who sells\r\nspoke-turning lathes? Who makes machinery for freeing wool of burrs\r\nand dirt? Where can tungsten, or tungsten steel, be procured, and at\r\nwhat price? Who sells silicate of alumina and silicate of potash?\" All\r\nsuch personal inquiries are printed, as will be observed, in the\r\ncolumn of \"Business and Personal,\" which is specially set apart for\r\nthat purpose, subject to the charge mentioned at the head of that\r\ncolumn. Almost any desired information can in this way be\r\nexpeditiously obtained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF INVENTIONS\r\nFOR WHICH\r\nLETTERS PATENT OF THE UNITED STATES WERE GRANTED IN THE WEEK ENDING\r\nJanuary 18, 1877,\r\nAND EACH BEARING THAT DATE.\r\n\r\n[Those marked (r) are reissued patents.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA complete copy of any patent in the annexed list, including both the\r\nspecifications and drawings, will be furnished from this office for\r\none dollar.

It is believed, that were\r\nowners fully aware of the small difference which now exists between\r\nthe use of Wood and Iron, that in many cases the latter would be\r\nadopted. We shall be pleased to furnish estimates for all the Beams\r\ncomplete, for any specific structure, so that the difference in cost\r\nmay at once be ascertained.

Any other copy may be furnished, such as Photographs, Pencil\r\nSketches, or the articles themselves, in which cases we have drawings\r\nmade in the best manner by our own trained draughtsmen. Photographs,\r\ntaken in the ordinary way, are suitable, and they may be of any size.\r\nWe make the plates larger or smaller, as desired. We are glad to have\r\ncustomers prepare their own Pen Drawings, and append one or two,\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS TO ARTISTS:\r\n\r\nThe most important requisite in Drawings for our use is that every\r\nline shall be _perfectly black._ The paper or drawing board must be\r\n_white_ and _smooth_. For fine work drawings should be made double the\r\nscale of the plate desired. Carefully observing these main points, the\r\nartist has the utmost freedom in his choice of styles of drawing.
