This has come as a culmination of the development along these\r\nlines during the past half century. It has shown itself in the\r\nbeginning of new religious sects with this as a, or the, fundamental\r\ntenet, in more wide-spread general movements, and in the scientific\r\nstudy and application of the principles underlying this form of\r\ntherapeutics.\r\n\r\nMany have been led astray because, being ignorant of the mental\r\nhealing movements and vagaries of the past, the late applications,\r\nveiled in metaphysical or religious verbiage, have seemed to them to\r\nbe new in origin and principle. No one could consider an historical\r\nsurvey of the subject and reasonably hold this opinion. It is on\r\naccount of the ignorance of similar movements, millenniums old, that\r\nso much, if any, originality can be credited to the founders.\r\n\r\nThe object of this volume is to present a general view of mental\r\nhealing, dealing more especially with the historical side of the\r\nsubject. While this is divided topically, the topics are presented in\r\na comparatively chronological order, and thereby trace the development\r\nof the subject to the present century.\r\n\r\nThe term \"mental healing\" is given the broadest possible use, and\r\ncomprehends any cures which may be brought about by the effect of the\r\nmind over the body, regardless of whether the power back of the cure\r\nis supposed to be deity, demons, other human beings, or the individual\r\nmind of the patient.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this may contribute to the knowledge of a subject\r\nwhich is of such wide-spread popular interest.\r\n\r\nGeorge Barton Cutten.\r\n\r\nWolfville, Nova Scotia,\r\n_December 1, 1910._\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\nBas-relief representing the Gallic AEsculapius\r\ndispatching a demon                          _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n                                                    FACING\r\n                                                      PAGE\r\n\r\nCure through the Intercession of a Healing Saint        72\r\n\r\nValentine Greatrakes                                   134\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm Digby                                       152\r\n\r\nKing's Touch-pieces                                    226\r\n\r\nF.

Even among the most crude and unobserving,\r\ntraditions and incidents have given witness to this knowledge. For\r\ncenturies stories of the hair turning white during the night on\r\naccount of fright or sorrow, the cause and cure of diseases through\r\nemotional disturbances, and death, usually directly by apoplexy,\r\ncaused by anger, grief, or joy, have been current and generally\r\naccepted. On the other hand, irritability and moroseness caused by\r\ndisordered organs of digestion, change of acumen or morals due to\r\ninjury of the brain or nervous system, and insanity produced by bodily\r\ndiseases, are also accepted proofs of the effect of the body on the\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nRecent scientific investigation has been directed along the line of\r\nthe influence of the mind over the body, and to that phase of this\r\ninfluence which deals with the cure rather than the cause of disease.\r\nIn addition to what the scientists have done along this line, various\r\nreligious cults have added the application of these principles to\r\ntheir other tenets and activities, or else have made this the chief\r\ncorner-stone of a new structure. There are some reasons why this\r\nconnection with religion should continue to exist, and why it has been\r\na great help both to the building up of these particular sects and the\r\nhealing of the bodies of those who combine religion with mental\r\nhealing.\r\n\r\nWe must not forget that in early days the priest, the magician, and\r\nthe physician were combined in one person, and that primitive\r\nreligious notions are difficult to slough off. Shortly before the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era there were some indications that\r\nhealing was to be freed from the bondage of religion, but the\r\ninfluence of Jesus' healing upon Christians, and the overwhelming\r\ninfluence of Christianity upon the whole world, delayed this movement,\r\nso that it did not again become prominent until the sixteenth\r\ncentury. About this time, when therapeutics as a science began to\r\nshake off the shackles of religion and superstition, another startling\r\ninnovation was noticeable, viz., the division of mental healing into\r\nreligious and non-religious healing. This change came gradually, and\r\nas is usual in all reform, certain prophets saw and proclaimed the\r\nreal truth which the people were not able to follow or receive for\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, who lived during the first half of the sixteenth century,\r\nwrote these shrewd words: \"Whether the object of your faith is real or\r\nfalse, you will nevertheless obtain the same effects. Thus, if I\r\nbelieve in St. Peter's statue as I would have believed in St. Peter\r\nhimself, I will obtain the same effects that I would have obtained\r\nfrom St. Peter; but that is superstition. Faith, however, produces\r\nmiracles, and whether it be true or false faith, it will always\r\nproduce the same wonders.\" We have also this penetrating observation\r\nfrom Pierre Ponponazzi, of Milan, an author of the same century: \"We\r\ncan easily conceive the marvellous effects which confidence and\r\nimagination can produce, particularly when both qualities are\r\nreciprocal between the subject and the person who influences them. The\r\ncures attributed to the influence of certain relics are the effect of\r\nthis imagination and confidence. Quacks and philosophers know that if\r\nthe bones of any skeleton were put in the place of the saint's bones,\r\nthe sick would none the less experience beneficial effects, if they\r\nbelieved they were near veritable relics.\"\r\n\r\nWhat seemed to be a movement whereby mental healing should be divided\r\nso that only a portion of it should be connected with religion proved\r\nto be too far in advance of its time, and not until the advent of\r\nMesmer was this accomplished. Healing other than mental, however, did\r\nobtain its freedom at this time. While Mesmer and his followers\r\nemphasized non-religious mental healing, it should not be thought that\r\nmental therapeutics was ever entirely separated from the church. There\r\nhave always been found some sects which laid particular emphasis on\r\nit, and both Roman Catholic and Protestant orthodox Christianity have\r\nalways admitted it. It has been considered, even if not admitted, that\r\nthe power of the Infinite was more clearly shown by the healing of the\r\nbody than by the restoration of the moral life. It is natural, then,\r\nthat the sects which showed this special proof of God's presence and\r\npower would grow faster than their spiritual competitors, but that\r\nthey would decline more rapidly and surely than those which espoused\r\nmore spiritual doctrines.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not difficult to see why mental healing would\r\nbe helped by its connection with religion. Religion grips the whole\r\nmind more firmly than any other subject has ever done, and when one\r\naccepts the orthodox conception of God, he naturally expects to come\r\nin contact with One whose sympathies are in favor of the cure of his\r\ndiseases, and whose power is sufficient to bring about this cure. With\r\nthis basis there is set up in the mind of the patient an expectancy\r\nwhich has always proven to be a most valuable precursor of a cure. The\r\ndevout religious attitude of mind is one most favorable for the\r\nworking of suggestion, and persons of the temperament adapted to the\r\nreligious expression most valued in the past are those who could be\r\nmost readily affected by mental means. For these reasons, it can be\r\neasily understood why mental healing has continued to be associated\r\nwith religion, and why when thus associated it has been so successful.\r\n\r\nTo those not very familiar with mental healing, it has seemed strange\r\nthat any law could be formulated which would comprehend every variety.\r\nIn the following pages many different forms will be described, and in\r\nexamining the subject it will be found that many and varied are the\r\nexplanations given for the results produced. We find also a general\r\ndistrust of all the others, or else a claim that this particular sect\r\nis the only real and true exponent of mental healing, and that it\r\nproduces the only genuine cures. Those which claim to be Christian\r\nsects, however divergent the direct explanation of their results, give\r\nthe final credit to God, and base their _modus operandi_ upon the\r\nBible--in fact, they claim to be the direct successors of Jesus and\r\nhis disciples in this respect.\r\n\r\nWe find, however, that the healer connected with the Christian sect\r\nhas no advantage over his Mohammedan or Buddhist brother, and that\r\nneither is able to succeed better than the non-religious healer in all\r\ncases. We recognize that when one class of healers fails in a case\r\nanother may succeed, but the successful one is just as liable to fail\r\nin a second case when the first one cures. What particular form of\r\nsuggestion is most effective in any given case depends upon the\r\ntemperament of the individual and his education, religious training,\r\nand environment. When we consider the whole matter we are forced to\r\nthe conclusion that mental cures are independent of any particular\r\nsect, religion, or philosophy; some are cured by one form and some by\r\nanother. Not the creed, but some force which resides in the mind of\r\nevery one accomplishes the cure, and the most that any religion or\r\nphilosophy can do is to bring this force into action.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, one sharp distinction is noticed between the\r\nreligious and the non-religious healers, viz., the religious healer\r\nsees no limit to his healing power, and affirms that cancer and\r\nBright's disease are as easily cured, in theory at least, as neuralgia\r\nor insomnia; the non-religious healer, sometimes designated as the\r\n\"scientific healer,\" on the contrary, recognizes that there are some\r\ndiseases which are more easily cured than others, and that of those\r\nothers some are practically incurable by psycho-therapeutic methods.\r\n\r\nThe line has been drawn in the past between functional and organic\r\ndiseases, the former including diseases where there is simply a\r\nderangement of function, like indigestion, and the latter\r\ncomprehending the diseases where the organ is affected, like ulcer of\r\nthe stomach. The more we know about diseases the less sure we seem to\r\nbe about their classification; some of which we were formerly sure\r\nhave recently caused us considerable doubt. For example, we have\r\nformerly classed cancer as an organic disease and consequently\r\nincurable by mental means. The question is now asked, \"Is cancer an\r\norganic disease, or is it some functional derangement of the\r\nepithelium tissue which causes it to grow indefinitely until it\r\ninvades some vital organ?\"\r\n\r\nA further question arises due to further study. Some of the latest\r\ninvestigators claim that most if not all persons have cancer at some\r\ntime in life, but that anti-toxin or some other remedy is supplied by\r\nthe body itself, and the growth is stopped and the tissue absorbed.\r\nThe question then seems to be pertinent, \"If the body can produce the\r\ncure within itself, and this would be functional, why cannot mental\r\nmeans stimulate the body to produce it?\" or \"Does not mental influence\r\nstimulate the body to produce it?\" What the cancer experts tell us of\r\nthe wide-spread extension of the disease and its spontaneous cure, the\r\ntuberculosis experts affirm of tuberculosis, and certainly of the\r\nlatter disease spontaneous cures are not uncommon. We also know that\r\nmental influence may, in fact does, have an indirect but no less\r\nbeneficial influence in the cure of tuberculosis. From these examples\r\none seems to be forced to either one of two conclusions, either of\r\nwhich is contrary to generally accepted ideas, viz., first, that these\r\nare not organic diseases; or, second, organic diseases are aided or\r\ncured by means of mental healing. In general, however, the distinction\r\nholds good; the so-called functional cases are amenable to cure by\r\nmental means, and the organic are much less so.\r\n\r\nComing back, then, to the common law which underlies all cases or\r\nforms of mental healing, we find two general principles upon which it\r\nis built--the power of the mind over the body, and the importance of\r\nsuggestion as a factor in the cure of the disease. The law may be\r\ntersely stated in the first person as follows: My body tends to adjust\r\nitself so as to be in harmony with my ideas concerning it. This law is\r\nequally applicable to the cause or cure of disease by mental means. To\r\napply this law in a universal way as far as mental healing is\r\nconcerned, we should notice that however the thought of cure may come\r\ninto the mind, whether by external or auto-suggestion, if it is firmly\r\nrooted so as to impress the subconsciousness, that part of the mind\r\nwhich rules the bodily organs, a tendency toward cure is at once set\r\nup and continues as long as that thought has the ascendancy.\r\n\r\nHack Tuke quotes Johannes Mueller, a physiologist who lived during the\r\nfirst half of the last century, as follows: \"It may be stated as a\r\ngeneral fact that any state of body which is conceived to be\r\napproaching, and which is expected with certain confidence and\r\ncertainty of occurrence, will be very prone to ensue, as the mere\r\nresult of the idea, if it do not lie beyond the bounds of\r\npossibility.\" This is a fair statement of the law from the stand-point\r\nof consciousness, but does not include all of the vast influence of\r\nsubconscious ideas which are so potent in the cure of diseases by\r\nmental means. Mueller's observation was in advance of his times, but\r\ncould not be expected to include the results of the latest researches\r\nof modern science.\r\n\r\nFor a great many years physicians have recognized that not only are\r\nall diseases made worse by an incorrect mental attitude, but that some\r\ndiseases are the direct result of worry and other mental disturbances.\r\nThe mental force which causes colored water to act as an emetic, or\r\npostage-stamps to produce a blister, can also produce organic diseases\r\nof a serious nature. The large mental factor in the cause of diseases\r\nis generally admitted, and it seems reasonable to infer that what is\r\ncaused by mental influence may be cured by the same means. There is\r\nno restriction in the power of the mind in causing disease, and should\r\nwe restrict the mind as a factor in the cure? The trouble seems to be\r\nin the explanation. People ask, \"How can the mind have such an effect\r\nupon the body?\" and to the answer of this question we must now turn\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nWe all recognize that involuntarily certain bodily effects take place.\r\nWe blush when we do not wish to; we betray our fears by our blanched\r\nfaces. Some other factors of mind than the conscious mental processes\r\nhave charge, and rule certain functions. The heart, the respiratory\r\napparatus, the glands, and digestive organs all carry on their regular\r\nfunctions during sleep and also better without our direction when we\r\nare awake. What is the explanation of this? We have recently been\r\nsaying that the subconsciousness rules these physical organs, and\r\nthrough this that the effects already referred to take place. So much\r\nhas been written recently regarding the subconsciousness that anything\r\nmore at this time would be superfluous; suffice it to say that the\r\ngeneral conclusions on that subject are accepted as the basis of faith\r\ncure. We may, however, go further in our endeavor to explain.\r\n\r\nIn such mental troubles as psychasthesia much has lately been heard\r\nabout psycho-analysis and re-education. What does that mean in the\r\nlanguage of the psychology of a few years ago? In cases of\r\nunreasonable fears or phobias, for example, there is a firmly rooted\r\nsystem of ideas which refuses to depart at the command of\r\nconsciousness. We analyze the mental store to find out the cause of\r\nthe unreasonable persistence, and sometimes, quite frequently in fact,\r\nhave to resort to hypnosis or hypnodization to find the initial\r\ntrouble. It is then corrected, and re-education consists in living\r\nover again from the first experience, the events connected with that\r\nfear and correcting them up to date. In this process minutes only are\r\nused where the original experiences took weeks. Putting it in other\r\nwords, we have certain systems of ideas; as a psychological fact of\r\nlong standing we know that other elements may be injected into that\r\nsystem so as to change it, or that one system may be destroyed and\r\nanother system built up to take its place. This is the secret of cures\r\nof this nature--of mental troubles--the irritating factor, the thorn\r\nin the mind, is extracted.\r\n\r\nWe have heard in modern psychology of the hot and cold places in\r\nconsciousness, or, to use other terms for the same idea, the central\r\nand peripheral ideas, meaning the ideas which dominate consciousness,\r\nand those which are in the background. The mind can readily attend to\r\nonly one thing at a time; if that be pain, for example, that takes up\r\nall of our attention. On the other hand, if for some reason some other\r\nideas suddenly become central, then the pain is driven away to the\r\nperiphery and we say we have no pain, or we have less pain. The\r\nsufferer from neuralgia experiences no pain as he responds to the fire\r\nalarm, and the toothache stops entirely as we undergo the excitement\r\nand fear of entering the dentist's office. Serious lesions yield to\r\nprofound emotion born of persuasion, confidence, or excitement; either\r\nthe gouty or rheumatic man, after hobbling about for years, finds his\r\nlegs if pursued by a wild bull, or the weak and enfeebled invalid will\r\njump from the bed and carry out heavy articles from a burning house.\r\nThe central idea is sufficient to command all the reserve energy, and\r\nthat idea which has suddenly and unexpectedly become central may\r\nremain so. What Chalmers called \"the expulsive power of a new\r\naffection\" in the cure of souls, is the precise method of operation in\r\nthe cure of some bodily ills.\r\n\r\nI have here made two suggestions which may help to show how mental\r\nhealing may be brought about. Not simply the alleviation of bodily\r\nills, but the complete cure may result from the influence on the\r\nsubconsciousness. A large number of cures are brought about by faith\r\nin certain religious practices, this faith amounting to a certainty in\r\nthe minds of the patients before the cure is started or while it is in\r\nprogress. Trustful expectation in any one direction acts powerfully\r\nthrough the subconsciousness because it absorbs the whole mind, and\r\nthus competition with other ideas, either consciously or\r\nsubconsciously, is largely excluded. It is this which acts in mental\r\nhealing under the caption of faith, although some abnormal conditions\r\nmay also arise to assist the suggestion.\r\n\r\nThat this confident expectation of a cure is the most potent means of\r\nbringing it about, doing that which no medical treatment can\r\naccomplish, may be affirmed as the generalized result of experiences\r\nof the most varied kind, extending through a long series of ages. It\r\nis this factor which is common to methods of the most diverse\r\ncharacter. It is noticeable that any system of treatment, however\r\nabsurd, that can be puffed into public notoriety for efficacy, any\r\nindividual who by accident or design obtains a reputation for a\r\nspecial gift of healing, is certain to attract a multitude of\r\nsufferers, among whom will be many who are capable of being really\r\nbenefited by a strong assurance of relief. Thus, the practitioner with\r\na great reputation has an advantage over his neighboring physicians,\r\nnot only on account of the superior skill which he may have acquired,\r\nbut because his reputation causes this confident expectation, so\r\nbeneficial in itself.\r\n\r\nThere have been fashions in cures as in other things. At one time a\r\ncertain relic, or healer, would attract and cure, and shortly\r\nafterward it would be deserted and inefficacious, not because it had\r\nlost its power, but because it had lost its reputation, and the\r\npeople had consequently lost their faith in it. Some other relics\r\nwould then acquire a reputation, spring into popular favor, and the\r\ncrowds would flock to them. We have many modern instances of this\r\nkind. If sufficient confidence in the power of a concoction, a shrine,\r\na relic, or a person can be aroused, genuine cures can be wrought\r\nregardless of the healing properties of the dose.\r\n\r\nThe whole system of mental therapeutics may be divided into two parts;\r\nwhat we may designate as metaphysical cure denies that either matter\r\nor evil exists, and heals by inspiring the belief that the disease\r\ncannot assail the patient because he is pure spirit; the other class,\r\nfaith cure, recognizes the disease, but cures by faith in the power of\r\ndivinity, persons, objects, or suggestion.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the best example of the former theory and the most\r\nsuccessful application of it are found in Christian Science. Perhaps\r\nit is not so difficult to understand the frame of mind which brought\r\nabout this theory on the part of Mrs. Eddy. Here was an hysterical,\r\nneurotic woman who knew nothing all her life but illness and\r\nmisfortune. She had suffered much from many physicians and was none\r\nthe better but rather worse. One physician had called her disease one\r\nthing, another had designated it another, until confusion and\r\nuncertainty were increased with every physician consulted. She began\r\nto despair of ever either knowing about her disease or of having it\r\ncured. As a last resort she went to Quimby, and he told her there was\r\nno disease and no need of suffering. He denied the suffering, and she\r\naccepted his teaching; she followed him in denying disease and then\r\nmatter, and kept on with her theory of negation and denial until she\r\nevolved her present theory. It was a natural reaction from all\r\nconceivable pains characteristic of hysteria, to no pain; from all\r\nconceivable diseases which different physicians had opined, to no\r\ndisease; from the infirmity of body with its inhibitory discomfitures,\r\nto no body. The history of the founder of Christian Science is its\r\nbest _raison d'etre_, especially from a psychological stand-point, and\r\nthe rather strange thing is that a reaction from an abnormality, going\r\nas it naturally does to another abnormality, should find a response in\r\nthe religious cravings of so many; the philosophy undoubtedly would\r\nnot attract as it does were there not connected with it, in the\r\npractical working of the system, the lure of mental healing.\r\n\r\nFaith cure, the other form of mental healing, has such a variety of\r\nforms that it is practically impossible to describe a typical one.\r\nFaith in some power, or, what amounts to the same thing, the\r\nuncritical reception of suggestions concerning the cure, is the common\r\nfactor in all forms.\r\n\r\nThe question naturally arises, Which is the best form of mental\r\nhealing? There is no best form for all diseases and all persons. For\r\nexample, it matters not how new associational systems are formed so\r\nlong as they are substituted for the pernicious ones. It may be in the\r\ncommon experiences of every-day life, through the pleading of a\r\nfriend, during sleep or trance, in some abnormal state of a hypnotic\r\ncharacter, or during religious ecstasy, and we cannot well say in any\r\ngiven case that one form will be more efficacious than another. Mental\r\nhealing creates nothing new, but simply makes use of the normal\r\nmechanism of the mind and body. The question then is, What method of\r\nmental healing is most likely to stimulate the mental mechanism so\r\nthat physiological processes will be set up leading to a cure? The\r\ngreat power of faith and expectancy may decide the question, and the\r\nanswer may be in favor of the form in which the patient has the most\r\nfaith, either on account of its reputation, or on account of some\r\nprejudice on the part of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEARLY CIVILIZATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The office of the physician extends equally to the\r\n  purification of mind and body; to neglect the one is to\r\n  expose the other to evident peril. It is not only the\r\n  body that by its sound constitution strengthens the\r\n  soul, but the well-regulated soul by its authoritative\r\n  power maintains the body in perfect health.\"--PLATO.\r\n\r\n  \"Aristotle mapped out philosophy and morals in lines the\r\n  world yet accepts in the main, but he did not know the\r\n  difference between the nerves and the tendons. Rome had\r\n  a sound system of jurisprudence before it had a\r\n  physician, using only priest-craft for healing. Cicero\r\n  was the greatest lawyer the world has seen, but there\r\n  was not a man in Rome who could have cured him of a\r\n  colic. The Greek was an expert dialectician when he was\r\n  using incantations for his diseases. As late as when the\r\n  Puritans were enunciating their lofty principles, it was\r\n  generally held that the king's touch would cure\r\n  scrofula. Governor Winthrop, of colonial days, treated\r\n  'small-pox and all fevers' by a powder made from 'live\r\n  toads baked in an earthen pot in the open\r\n  air.'\"--MUNGER.\r\n\r\n  \"There is nothing so absurd or ridiculous that has not\r\n  at some time been said by some philosopher. Fontenelle\r\n  says he would undertake to persuade the whole republic\r\n  of readers to believe that the sun was neither the cause\r\n  of light or heat, if he could only get six philosophers\r\n  on his side.\"--GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\nA glance at the history of medicine will show three fairly well\r\ndefined periods. The beginning of the first is hidden in the uncertain\r\ndays of prehistoric ages and the period continues down to early\r\nChristian times--perhaps the end of the second century when Galen\r\ndied. The second period extends from this time to the fifteenth or\r\nsixteenth centuries, and the third period embraces the last three or\r\nfour centuries. The second period was almost wholly stationary, and\r\nthis, we are ashamed to say, was largely due to the prohibitive\r\nattitude of the church. The science of medicine, then, is almost\r\nwholly the result of the investigations and study of the last period.\r\nThis means that medicine is one of the youngest of the sciences, while\r\nfrom the very nature of the case it is one of the oldest of arts.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the art of therapeutics, mental healing has been\r\na large factor in the cure. This was not recognized, of course, for\r\nonly in the last century has the psychic element been admitted to any\r\nextent as a therapeutic agent. We can read back now, however, and see\r\nwhat a large element this really was. The cruder the art, the more\r\npowerful was the mental influence. The ways of primitive therapeutics\r\nare completely hidden from us except what we can gather from the races\r\nwhich retained their primitive practices in historic times. We can\r\nwell understand, though, that the concoctions of medicine-men and\r\nwitch-doctors could have little effect except in a suggestive way.\r\nSnakes' heads, toads' toes, lizards' tails, and beetles' wings have a\r\nsmall place in the pharmacopoeia of to-day, except as placebos, and\r\nit is extremely doubtful if they were ever valuable for any other\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe object of the primitive practitioner seems to have been to make an\r\nimpression upon the patient either by the explanation of his disease\r\nor by the effort made to effect a cure. The explanation most\r\nfrequently given was that demons were responsible for the trouble, and\r\nthe cure of the disease was an attempted exorcism of the demon. The\r\nmore fantastic the ceremony, the more likely the cure, on account of\r\nthe mental influence upon the patient. The primitive man's religion\r\nand therapeutics were inextricably interwoven and, unless we make an\r\nexception of the past few years, this has always been an unprofitable\r\nunion for one or both. All the early civilizations with the exception\r\nof the Greeks, as well as the Christian nations up to the sixteenth\r\ncentury, were handicapped by this partnership, and it was only by\r\ndivorcing the two that therapeutics was able to make the great advance\r\nduring the last period. The nature of the primitive religions was\r\nresponsible to a great extent for the nature of the method of healing,\r\ntherefore, appeasing the offended deity and exorcising the demon were\r\ntherapeutic as well as religious ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese of to-day, except in some of the seaboard cities, must be\r\nclassed among the earliest civilizations, for their mode of living has\r\nnot changed much in the last two or three milleniums. Their system of\r\nmedical practice partakes of the character of that found among the early\r\npeople, with some slight modifications which show some relationship to\r\nthe European practice during the Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of disgusting doses are administered, and incantations and\r\nexorcisms are among the most effective methods of healing. For\r\nexample, Hardy reports that a missionary told him of his being called\r\nin to see a man suffering from convulsions; he found him smelling\r\nwhite mice in a cage, with a dead fowl fastened on his chest, and a\r\nbundle of grass attached to his feet. This had been the prescription\r\nof a native physician.\r\n\r\nMedicines are made from asses' sinews, fowls' blood, bears' gall,\r\nshaving of a rhinoceros' horn, moss grown on a coffin, and the dung of\r\ndogs, pigs, fowl, rabbits, pigeons, and bats. Cockroach tea, bear-paw\r\nsoup, essence of monkey paw, toads' eyebrows, and earth-worms rolled\r\nin honey are common doses. The excrement of a mosquito is considered\r\nas efficacious as it is scarce, and here, as in Europe in the Middle\r\nAges, the hair of the dog that bit you is used to heal the bite and to\r\nprevent hydrophobia. An infusion from the bones of a tiger is believed\r\nto confer courage, strength, and agility, and the flesh of a snake is\r\nboiled and eaten to make one cunning and wise. Chips from coffins\r\nwhich have been let down into the grave are boiled and are said to\r\npossess great virtue for catarrh. Flies, fleas, and bedbugs prepared\r\nin different ways are given for various diseases. Medicines are given\r\nin all forms, and not infrequently pills are as large as a pigeon's\r\negg. If any of these medicines ever had any beneficent effect it must\r\nhave been through mental rather than through physical means.\r\n\r\nNevius has left us in no doubt concerning the belief in demons among\r\nthe Chinese, and of the effect this belief has on their theory of\r\ndisease. Certain forms are daily observed to drive away the evil\r\nspirits. For this purpose Taoist priests are hired to recite formulae,\r\nring bells, and manipulate bowls of water, candles, joss-sticks, and\r\ncurious charms. Sometimes the family insists that one of the priests\r\nshall ascend a ladder, the rounds of which are formed of swords or\r\nknives with the sharp edge uppermost, and go through his exorcisms at\r\nthe top. Instead of the priest, the mother may make a fire of paper\r\nand wave a small garment of her sick child over it.\r\n\r\nA relative or friend of a sick person will visit a temple and beat the\r\ndrum, which notifies the god that there is urgent need of his help. To\r\nbe sure that the god hears, his ears are tickled, and the part of the\r\nimage which corresponds to the afflicted part of the sick person's\r\nbody is rubbed. Some ashes from the censor standing before the image\r\nmay be taken to the sick-room and there reverenced. Holy water is\r\nbrought from the temple, boiled with tea, and drunk as a certain cure\r\nfor disease. Spells are written on paper and burned; the ashes are\r\nthen put into water and drunk as medicine. Charms and magical tricks\r\nof all kinds are tried in order to drive away the demon.\r\n\r\nThere were schools of medicine in Egypt in the fifteenth century\r\nbefore the Christian era, and the Egyptians made great progress in the\r\nstudy and practice of medicine. Notwithstanding this, we find many\r\nexamples of mental healing, or at least attempts at healing by mental\r\nmeans, among the recipes and prescriptions which have come down to us.\r\nPoor and superstitious persons, especially, had recourse to dreams, to\r\nwizards, to donations, to sacred animals, and to exvotos to the gods.\r\nCharms were also written for the credulous, some of which have been\r\nfound on small pieces of papyrus, which were rolled up and worn, as by\r\nthe modern Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThe Ebers papyrus, an important and very ancient manual of Egyptian\r\nmedicine, has thrown much light on early Egyptian practices. It shows\r\nthat an important part of the treatment prior to 1552 B. C., consisted\r\nin the laying on of hands, combined with an extensive formulary and\r\nceremonial rites. The physicians were the priests, and among the\r\ninteresting contents of this manuscript are several formulae to be used\r\nas prayers while compounding medicaments. Some of the prescriptions\r\ngiven here are accompanied by exorcisms which were to be used at the\r\nsame time. Many of the prescriptions could have had little but mental\r\ninfluence because the remedies recommended consisted of horrible\r\nmixtures of unsavory ingredients, the theory, if we can judge by the\r\nmedicines, being that the more disgusting the dose the more\r\nefficacious the remedy; this is true from a mental stand-point.\r\n\r\nDemonism was not unknown; in fact, it underlay much of the treatment.\r\nPeople did not die, but they were assassinated. The murderer might\r\nbelong to this or to the spirit world. He might be a god, a spirit, or\r\nthe soul of a dead man that had cunningly entered a living person. The\r\nphysician must first discover the nature of the possessing spirit, and\r\nthen attack it. Powerful magic was the weapon used, and the healer\r\nmust be an expert in reciting incantations and skilful in making\r\namulets. On account of this, the Egyptians became the most skilled in\r\nmagic of any people, and have their equals only in the Hindus of\r\nto-day. The experiences of Joseph and Moses, as recorded in the Bible,\r\ngive us some idea of their skill at that time. After the exorcism the\r\nphysician used medicine to relieve the disorders which the presence of\r\nthe strange being had produced in the body.\r\n\r\nMaspero gives us the following information: \"The cure-workers are\r\ndivided into several categories. Some incline towards sorcery, and\r\nhave faith in formulas and talismans only; they think they have done\r\nenough if they have driven out the spirit. Others extol the use of\r\ndrugs; they study the qualities of plants and minerals, describe the\r\ndiseases to which each of the substances provided by nature is\r\nsuitable, and settle the exact time when they must be procured and\r\napplied; certain herbs have no power unless they are gathered during\r\nthe night at the full moon, others are efficacious in summer only,\r\nanother acts equally well in winter or summer. The best doctors\r\ncarefully avoid binding themselves exclusively to either method.\"[1]\r\n\r\nAmong the early Egyptians the human body was divided into thirty-six\r\nparts, each of which was thought to be under the particular government\r\nof one of the aerial demons, who presided over the triple divisions of\r\nthe twelve signs. The priests practised a separate invocation for each\r\ngenius, which they used in order to obtain for them the cure of the\r\nparticular member confided to their care. We have the authority of\r\nOrigen for saying that in his time when any part of the body was\r\ndiseased, a cure was effected by invoking the demon to whose province\r\nit belonged. Perhaps this is why the different parts of the body were\r\nassigned to the different planets, and later to different saints. It\r\nundoubtedly accounts for the fact that an Egyptian physician treated\r\nonly one part of the body and refused to infringe on the domain of his\r\nbrother physician.\r\n\r\nIncubation was commonly practised at the temples of Isis and Serapis\r\nas it was afterward among the Greeks. This \"temple sleep\" was closely\r\nakin in its effects to hypnotism and was undoubtedly efficacious in\r\nthe case of some diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian system of therapeutics was not unlike the Egyptian as\r\nfar as incantations were concerned. Many of these have been\r\ndiscovered. The formulas usually consist of a description of the\r\ndisease and its symptoms, a desire for deliverance from it, and an\r\norder for it to depart. Some draughts were given which may have had\r\nsome medicinal effect, but they were supposed to be enchanted drinks.\r\nKnots were supposed to have some magical effect on diseases, and\r\nconjurations were also wrought by the power of numbers. The Book of\r\nDaniel shows the official recognition given to magicians, astrologers,\r\nand sorcerers.\r\n\r\nThe Jews seem to have got their early medical knowledge from the\r\nEgyptians, and changed it only in so far as their religion made it\r\nnecessary, for with them as with others the healing art was a part of\r\nthe religion, and the Levites were the sole practitioners. Much\r\nvaluable medical knowledge was mixed with much that could only have\r\nhad a mental influence. Disease was considered a punishment for sin,\r\nand hence the cure was religious rather than medical. The disease\r\nmight be inflicted by God direct, and the cure would be a proof of his\r\nforgiveness; it might also be inflicted by Satan or the spirits of the\r\nair with the permission of Jehovah, and the cure would then be brought\r\nabout by exorcism.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a rather elaborate system of demonology among\r\nthe Jews, who were at one time the chief exponents of the doctrine,\r\nand consequently the principal exorcists. Among the Jews a prominent\r\n\"demoness of sickness is Bath-Chorin. She touches the hands and lower\r\nlimbs by night. Many diseases are caused by demons.\" According to\r\nJosephus, \"to demons may be ascribed leprosy, rabies, asthma, cardiac\r\ndiseases, nervous diseases, which last are the specialty of evil\r\ndemons, such as epilepsy.\" Incantations were in use among the later\r\nJews, and amulets of neck-chains like serpents and ear-rings were\r\nemployed to protect the wearers against the evil eye and similar\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nIn India, medicine became a separate science very early, according to\r\nthe sacred books, the Vedas. Notwithstanding this, demonology played a\r\nlarge part in the production of disease according to their theories,\r\nand religious observances were helpful in the cures.\r\n\r\nAmong the oldest documents which we possess relative to the practice\r\nof medicine, are the various treatises contained in the collection\r\nwhich bears the name of Hippocrates (460-375 B. C.). He was the first\r\nphysician to relieve medicine from the trammels of superstition and\r\nthe delusions of philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks undoubtedly believed in demons, but, different from the\r\nnations around them, considered the demons to be well-intentioned.\r\nHomer (c. 1000 B. C.) speaks frequently of demons, and in one instance\r\nin the Odyssey tells of a sick man pining away, \"one upon whom a\r\nhateful demon had gazed.\" Empedocles (c. 490-430 B. C.) taught that\r\ndemons \"were of a mixed and inconstant nature, and are subjected to a\r\npurgatorial process which may finally end in their ascension to higher\r\nabodes.\" Yet he attributed to them nearly all the calamities,\r\nvexations, and plagues incident to mankind. Plato (427-347 B. C.)\r\nwrites of demons good and bad, and Aristotle (384-322 B. C.), the son\r\nof a physician, speaks directly of \"demons influencing and inspiring\r\nthe possessed.\" Socrates (470-399 B. C.) claimed to have continually\r\nwith him a demon--a guardian spirit.\r\n\r\nIn Greece, in early days, physicians were looked upon as gods. Even\r\nafter the siege of Troy, the sons of the gods and the heroes were\r\nalone supposed to understand the secrets of medicine and surgery. At a\r\nlate period AEsculapius, the son of Apollo, was worshipped as a deity.\r\nWhen we speak of the art of healing in Greece, one naturally thinks of\r\nthe apparent monopoly of the AEsclepiades, who ministered unto the\r\nGrecian sick for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe original seat of the worship of AEsculapius was at Epidaurus, where\r\nthere was a splendid temple, adorned with a gold and ivory statue of\r\nthe god, who was represented sitting, one hand holding a staff, the\r\nother resting on the head of a serpent, the emblem of sagacity and\r\nlongevity; a dog crouched at his feet. The temple was frequented by\r\nharmless serpents, in the form of which the god was supposed to\r\nmanifest himself. According to Homer, his sons, Machaon and\r\nPodalirius, who were great warriors, treated wounds and external\r\ndiseases only; and it is probable that their father practised in the\r\nsame manner, as he is said to have invented the probe and the\r\nbandaging of wounds. His priests, the AEsclepiades, however, practised\r\nincantations, and cured diseases by leading their patients to believe\r\nthat the god himself delivered his prescriptions in dreams and\r\nvisions; for this imposture they were roughly satirized by\r\nAristophanes in his play of \"Plutus.\" It is probable that the\r\npreparations, consisting of abstinence, tranquillity, and bathing,\r\nrequisite for obtaining the divine intercourse, and, above all, the\r\nconfidence reposed in the AEsclepiades, were often productive of\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe excavations of Cavvadias at Epidaurus have furnished us with much\r\ninteresting material concerning the cures performed at this ancient\r\nshrine, five hundred years before the beginning of the Christian era.\r\nIf the modern physician still recognizes AEsculapius as his patron\r\nsaint, he must have great respect for mental healing. It appears\r\ncertain from inscriptions found upon \"stelae\" that were dug up at\r\nEpidaurus and published in 1891, that the system of AEsculapius was\r\nbased upon the miracle-working of a demi-god, and not upon medical art\r\nas we now know it. The _modus operandi_ was unique in some details.\r\nThe patients, mostly incurables, came laden with sacrifices. After\r\nprayer, they cleansed themselves with water from the holy well, and\r\noffered up sacrifices. Certain ceremonial acts were then performed by\r\nthe priests, and the patients were put to sleep on the skins of the\r\nanimals offered at the altar, or at the foot of the statue of the\r\ndivinity, while the priests performed further sacred rites. The son of\r\nApollo then appeared to them in dreams, attended to the particular\r\nailments of the sufferers, and specified further sacrifices or acts\r\nwhich would restore health. In many cases the sick awoke suddenly\r\ncured. Large sums of money were asked for these cures; from one\r\ninscription we learn that a sum corresponding to $12,000 was paid as a\r\nfee. The record of the cure was carved on the temple as at Lourdes\r\nto-day, _e.g._:\r\n\r\n\"Some days back, a certain Caius, who was blind, learned from an\r\noracle that he should repair to the temple, put up his fervent\r\nprayers, cross the sanctuary from right to left, place his five\r\nfingers on the altar, then raise his hand and cover his eyes. He\r\nobeyed, and instantly his sight was restored, amid the loud\r\nacclamations of the multitude. These signs of the omnipotence of the\r\ngods were shown in the reign of Antoninus.\"\r\n\r\n\"A blind soldier, named Valerius Apes, having consulted the oracle,\r\nwas informed that he should mix the blood of a white cock with honey,\r\nto make up an ointment to be applied to his eyes for three consecutive\r\ndays. He received his sight, and returned public thanks to the gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julian appeared lost beyond all hope, from a spitting of blood. The\r\ngods ordered him to take from the altar some seeds of the pine, and to\r\nmix them with honey, of which mixture he was to eat for three days. He\r\nwas saved, and came to thank the gods in the presence of the\r\npeople.\"[2]\r\n\r\nIt was not until five centuries later, when credulity concerning\r\nmiracles was on the wane, that the priests began to study and to apply\r\nmedical means in order to sustain the reputation of the place, and to\r\nkeep up its enormous revenues.\r\n\r\nTemples similar to this one at Epidaurus existed at numerous places,\r\namong which were Rhodes, Cnidus, Cos, and one was to be found on the\r\nbanks of the Tiber. The temple at Cos was rich in votive offerings,\r\nwhich generally represented the parts of the body healed, and an\r\naccount of the method of cure adopted. From these singular clinical\r\nrecords, Hippocrates, a reputed descendant of AEsculapius, is reported\r\nto have constructed his treatise on Dietetics.\r\n\r\nFor a long time after the age of Hercules and the heroic times,\r\ninvalids in Greece sought relief from their sufferings from these\r\ndescendants of AEsculapius in the temples of that god, which an\r\nenlightened policy had raised on elevated spots, near medicinal\r\nsprings, and in salubrious vicinities. Those men who pretended in\r\nright of birth to hold the gift of curing, finally learned the art of\r\nit. The preservation in the temple of the history of those diseases,\r\nthe cure of which had been sought by them, aided greatly in this happy\r\nculmination.\r\n\r\nOf AEsculapius himself, it is said that he employed the trumpet to cure\r\nsciatica; he claimed that its continued sound made the fibres of the\r\nnerves to palpitate, and the pain vanished. In line with this\r\ntreatment, Democritus affirmed that diseases are capable of being\r\ncured by the sound of a flute, when properly played.\r\n\r\nHerbs were also used among the Greeks, but almost wholly in the form\r\nof charms rather than on account of what we claim now as real\r\nmedicinal value. For example, great virtues were ascribed to the herb\r\nalysson which was pounded and eaten with meat to cure hydrophobia. If\r\nsuspended in the house, it promoted the health of the inmates and\r\nprotected both men and cattle from enchantments; when bound in a piece\r\nof scarlet flannel round the necks of the latter, it preserved them\r\nfrom all diseases.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been no independent school of Roman medicine. From\r\nearly times there was a very complicated system of superstitious\r\nmedicine, as a part of the religion, which is supposed to have been\r\nborrowed from the Etruscans. This comprehended both the theory and\r\ncure of disease. The Romans got along for centuries without doctors;\r\nin fact, doctors were a Grecian importation, not made until about two\r\ncenturies before Christ.\r\n\r\n  [1] G.

Miraculous water from the rock does not quench\r\n  the thirst better than that which bubbles from the\r\n  village spring.\"--BERDOE.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Christian religion into the world, while purporting\r\nto minister especially to the spiritual life, had a wide-reaching and\r\npotent influence on the art of healing the body. We cannot sum up the\r\neffect by saying that this influence was either wholly good or\r\nbad--its relation to therapeutics was a mixed one. It can be\r\ntruthfully said that nothing has retarded the science of medicine\r\nduring the past two thousand years so much as the iron grip of\r\ndecadent orthodoxy, and, on the other hand, no power has caused men\r\nand women so to sacrifice time, money, and even life itself for the\r\ncare and nurture of the sick, as the example and precepts of Jesus\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nFor eighteen centuries this paradoxical position was held by the\r\nchurch, and the antithetical attitudes of hindrance and help continued\r\nto exist. As valuable as was the spirit instilled into the hearts of\r\nHis followers by the tenderness of the Master, it was never sufficient\r\nto counterbalance the deterrent effects of the religion which they\r\nespoused. The retardation was caused by two related beliefs which\r\npermeated the church: The first was the doctrine of the power of\r\ndemons in the lives of men, especially in the production of disease;\r\nand the second was the prevalence of the idea of the possibility and\r\nprobability of the performance of miracles, particularly in the\r\nhealing of diseases.\r\n\r\nA rather complicated science of demonology had come down from\r\nprimitive sources through Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek\r\ncivilization, although the demons of the Greeks were principally good\r\nspirits. At the time of Christ, however, the Jews were the most ardent\r\nadvocates of demonology, and hence the chief exorcists. They expelled\r\ndemons partly by adjuration and partly by means of a certain\r\nmiraculous root named Baaras. They considered it nothing at all out\r\nof the ordinary to meet men who were possessed by demons, and just as\r\ncommon an experience to see them healed by having the demon exorcised.\r\nJosephus assures us that in the reign of Vespasian he had himself seen\r\na Jew named Eleazar perform an exorcism; by means of adjuration and\r\nthe Baaras root he drew a demon through the nostrils of a possessed\r\nperson, who fell to the ground on the accomplishment of the miracle,\r\nwhile on the command of the magician the demon, to prove that it had\r\nreally left its victim, threw down a cup of water which had been\r\nplaced at a distance.\r\n\r\nKnowing as we do the close relationship between Judaism and\r\nChristianity, it does not surprise us to discover that the Christians\r\ninherited the doctrine and practice of the Jews in this matter. This\r\nis more readily understood when we remember the connection of Jesus\r\nwith cases of demoniacal possession, and Paul's frequent references to\r\nthe spirits of the air. Following the example of their Master,\r\nChristians everywhere became exorcists. Through the influence of\r\nPhilo's writings, Jewish demonology was propagated among Christian\r\nconverts, and the Gnostics quickly absorbed and spread the notion of\r\npreternatural interposition. Next to the belief in the second coming\r\nof Christ, the doctrine which most influenced the action of the early\r\nchurch was that of a spiritual world and its hierarchy. Terrestrial\r\nthings were ruled by all sorts of spiritual beings.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers, as well as the founders of different religions,\r\nexpelled demons, and the Christians fully recognized the power\r\npossessed by the Jewish and gentile exorcists; the followers of\r\nChrist, however, claimed to be in many respects the superior of all\r\nothers. The fathers maintained the reality of all pagan miracles as\r\nfully as their own, except that doubt was sometimes cast on some forms\r\nof healing and prophecy. Demons which had resisted all the\r\nenchantments of the pagans might be cast out, oracles could be\r\nsilenced, and unclean spirits compelled to acknowledge the truth of\r\nthe Christian faith by the Christians, who simply made the sign of the\r\ncross, or repeated the name of the Master.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Christian exorcists was shown by still more wonderful\r\nfeats. Demons, which were sometimes supposed to enter animals, were\r\nexpelled. St. Hilarion (288-371), we are told, courageously confronted\r\nand relieved a possessed camel. \"The great St. Ambrose [340-397] tells\r\nus that a priest, while saying mass, was troubled by the croaking of\r\nfrogs in a neighboring marsh; that he exorcised them, and so stopped\r\ntheir noise. St. Bernard [1091-1153], as the monkish chroniclers tell\r\nus, mounting the pulpit to preach in his abbey, was interrupted by a\r\ncrowd of flies; straightway the saint uttered the sacred formula of\r\nexcommunication, when the flies fell dead upon the pavement in heaps,\r\nand were cast out with shovels! A formula of exorcism attributed to a\r\nsaint of the ninth century, which remained in use down to a recent\r\nperiod, especially declares insects injurious to crops to be possessed\r\nof evil spirits, and names, among the animals to be excommunicated or\r\nexorcised, moles, mice, and serpents. The use of exorcism against\r\ncaterpillars and grasshoppers was also common. In the thirteenth\r\ncentury a bishop of Lausanne, finding that the eels in Lake Leman\r\ntroubled the fishermen, attempted to remove the difficulty by\r\nexorcism, and two centuries later one of his successors excommunicated\r\nall the May-bugs in the diocese. As late as 1731 there appears an\r\nentry on the municipal register of Thonon as follows: '_Resolved_,\r\nthat this town join with other parishes of this province in obtaining\r\nfrom Rome an excommunication against the insects, and that it will\r\ncontribute _pro rata_ to the expense of the same.'\"\r\n\r\nScripture was cited to prove the diabolical character of some animals\r\nduring the Middle Ages. Says White: \"Did anyone venture to deny that\r\nanimals could be possessed by Satan, he was at once silenced by\r\nreference to the entrance of Satan into the serpent in the Garden of\r\nEden, and to the casting of devils into swine by the Founder of\r\nChristianity himself.\"[3]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the pleasing theory adopted by the earlier Christian\r\nwriters that the powers of darkness were unable to harm the faithful\r\nwithout the permission of divinity, to whom demoniacal spirits were\r\nultimately subjected, unlimited power was conceded to those beings who\r\nexisted under divine sanction. Demoniacal aeons or emanations were\r\nacknowledged to be the primitive source of earthly sufferings,\r\npestilence among men, sickness and other bodily afflictions, but\r\ninflicted with the consent of God, whose messengers they were.\r\n\r\nEarly Christian writers boldly asserted that all the disorders of the\r\nworld originated with the devil and his sinister companions, because\r\nthey were stirred with the unholy desire to obtain associates in their\r\nmiseries. It was impossible to fix a limit to the number of these\r\nmalevolent spirits constantly provoking diseases and infirmities upon\r\nmen. They were alleged to surround mankind so densely that each person\r\nhad a thousand to his right and ten thousand to the left of him.\r\nEndowed with the subtlest activity, they were able to reach the\r\nremotest points of earth in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nAccording to Salverte, Tatian, a sincere defender of Christianity, who\r\nlived in the second century, \"does not deny the wonderful cures\r\neffected by the priests of the temples of the Polytheists; he only\r\nattempts to explain them by supposing that the pagan gods were actual\r\ndemons, and that they introduced disease into the body of a healthy\r\nman, announcing to him, in a dream, that he should be cured if he\r\nimplored their assistance; and then, by terminating the evil which\r\nthey themselves had produced, they obtained the glory of having worked\r\nthe miracle.\"[4]\r\n\r\nSo firm was the belief that Christians could exorcise these demons\r\nthat from the time of Justin Martyr (100-163), for about two\r\ncenturies, there is not a single Christian writer who does not\r\nsolemnly and explicitly assert the reality and frequent employment of\r\nthis power. In his Second Apology, Justin says: \"And now you can learn\r\nthis from what is under your own observation. For numberless demoniacs\r\nthroughout the whole world, and in your city, many of our Christian\r\nmen exorcising them in the name of Jesus Christ, who was crucified\r\nunder Pontius Pilate, have healed and do heal, rendering helpless and\r\ndriving the possessing demons out of the men, though they could not be\r\ncured by all the other exorcists, and those who used incantations and\r\ndrugs.\"\r\n\r\nIrenaeus (130-202) held that mankind, through transgressions of divine\r\ncommand, fell absolutely from the time of Adam into the power of\r\nSatan. On the other hand, he assures us that all Christians possessed\r\nthe power of working miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils,\r\nhealed the sick, and sometimes even raised the dead; that some who had\r\nbeen thus resuscitated lived for many years among them, and that it\r\nwould be impossible to reckon the wonderful acts that were daily\r\nperformed.[5]\r\n\r\nTertullian (160-220) insisted that a malevolent angel was in constant\r\nattendance upon every person, but in writing to the pagans in a time\r\nof persecution he challenged his opponents to bring forth any person\r\nwho was possessed by a demon or any of those prophets or virgins who\r\nwere supposed to be inspired by a divinity. He asserted that all\r\ndemons would be compelled to confess their diabolical character when\r\nquestioned by any Christians, and invited the pagans, if it were\r\notherwise, to put the Christian immediately to death, for this, he\r\nthought, was the simplest and most decisive demonstration of the\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\nLecky tells us of the attitude of the fathers toward demonism in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Justin Martyr, Origen, Lactantius, Athanasius, and\r\nMinucius Felix, all in language equally solemn and explicit, call upon\r\nthe pagans to form their own opinions from the confessions wrung from\r\ntheir own gods. We hear from them, that when a Christian began to\r\npray, to make the sign of the cross, or to utter the name of his\r\nMaster in the presence of a possessed or inspired person, the latter,\r\nby screams and frightful contortions, exhibited the torture that was\r\ninflicted, and by this torture the evil spirit was compelled to avow\r\nits nature. Several of the Christian writers declare that this was\r\ngenerally known to pagans.\"[6]\r\n\r\nOrigen (185-254) said: \"It is demons which produce famine,\r\nunfruitfulness, corruptions of the air, pestilence; they hover\r\nconcealed in clouds in the lower atmosphere, and are attracted by the\r\nblood and incense which the heathen offer to them as gods.\" He\r\nthought, though, that Raphael had special care of the sick and the\r\ninfirm. Cyprian (186-258) charged that demons caused luxations and\r\nfractures of the limbs, undermined the health, and harassed with\r\ndiseases. Up to this time it was the privilege of any Christian to\r\nexorcise demons, but Pope Fabian (236-250) assigned a definite name\r\nand functions to exorcists as a separate order. To-day the priest has\r\nincluded in his ordination vows those of exorcist. Gregory of\r\nNazianzus (329-390) declared that bodily pains are provoked by demons,\r\nand that medicines are useless, but that demoniacs are often cured by\r\nlaying on of consecrated hands. St. Augustine (354-430) said: \"All\r\ndiseases of Christians are to be ascribed to these demons; chiefly do\r\nthey torment fresh-baptized Christians, yea, even the guiltless\r\nnew-born infants.\"\r\n\r\nBaltus[7] says: \"De tous les anciens auteurs ecclesiastiques, n'y en\r\nayant pas un qui n'ait parle de ce pouvoir admirable que les Chretiens\r\navoient de chasser les demons,\" and Gregory of Tours (538-594) says\r\nthat exorcism was common in his time, having himself seen a monk named\r\nJulian cure by his words a possessed person. This testimony of\r\nGregory's concerning the prevalence of exorcisms at the end of the\r\nsixth century is interesting in view of the facts that the Council of\r\nLaodicea, in the fourth century, forbade any one to exorcise, except\r\nthose duly authorized by the bishop, and that in the very beginning of\r\nthe fifth century a physician named Posidonius denied the existence of\r\npossession. The fathers of the church, however, ridiculed the solemn\r\nassertion of physicians that many of these alleged demoniacal\r\ninfirmities were attributable to material agencies, and were fully\r\npersuaded in their own minds that demons took possession of the\r\norganism of the human body.\r\n\r\nAt about this time, such a broad-minded man as Gregory the Great\r\n(540-604) solemnly related that a nun, having eaten some lettuce without\r\nmaking the sign of the cross, swallowed a devil, and that, when\r\ncommanded by a holy man to come forth, the devil replied: \"How am I to\r\nblame? I was sitting on the lettuce, and this woman, not having made the\r\nsign of the cross, ate me along with it.\" This is but an example of the\r\nideas concerning the entrance of demons into the possessed.[8] Besides\r\nthe possibility of being taken into the mouth with one's food, they\r\nmight enter while the mouth was opened to breathe. Exorcists were\r\ntherefore careful to keep their mouths closed when casting out evil\r\nspirits, lest the imps should jump into their mouths from the mouths of\r\nthe patients. Another theory was that the devil entered human beings\r\nduring sleep, and at a comparatively recent period a king of Spain,\r\nCharles II (1661-1700), kept off the devil while asleep by the presence\r\nof his confessor and two friars.[9]\r\n\r\nShortly before the reign of Gregory, there came into vogue the fashion\r\nof exorcising demons by means of a written formula rather than by the\r\nearlier means of making the sign of the cross and invoking the name of\r\nJesus. The theory of demonology was never very clear nor consistent.\r\nBy some it was claimed that in the practice of the magical arts evil\r\nspirits provided cure for sickness, others maintained that they could\r\nnot heal any diseases, and hence the true test of Christianity was the\r\nability to cure bodily ills. A compromise position was that demons\r\nwere only successful in eliminating diseases which they had themselves\r\ncaused. There was not a little doubt in some cases about the character\r\nof the possessing spirits, and it behooved people to be careful;\r\ndemons might use men as habitations, and while posing as good angels\r\nvitiate health and provoke disease.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventh century, we have an account of an\r\nexorcism by St. Gall (556-640), and during the Carlovingian age the\r\nhealing at Monte Cassino was based on the Satanic origin of disease.\r\nWhen the conversion of northern races to Christianity began,\r\ndemonology received a stimulus. An unlimited number of demons, similar\r\nin individuality and prowess, were substituted for the pagan demons,\r\nand the pagan gods were added as additional demons. When proselytes\r\nwere taken into the church, care was taken to exorcise all evil\r\nspirits. During the baptismal service the Satanic hosts, as\r\noriginators of sin, vice, and maladies, were expelled by insufflation\r\nof the officiating clergyman, the sign of the cross, and the\r\ninvocation of the Triune Deity. The earliest formulas for such\r\nexpulsion directed a double exhalation of the priest.[10]\r\n\r\nIn all epidemics of the Middle Ages, such persons as were afflicted by\r\npestilent diseases were declared contaminated by the devil, and\r\ncarried to churches and chapels, a dozen at a time, securely bound\r\ntogether. They were thrown upon the floor, where they lay, according\r\nto the attestation of a pitying chronicler, until dead or restored to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nUnsound mind was universally accepted as a specific distinction of\r\ndiabolical power, and caused by the corporeal presence of an impure\r\nspirit. Imbeciles and the insane were, throughout the Middle Ages,\r\nespecially conceded to be the abode of avenging and frenzied demons.\r\nIn aggravated cases, the actual presence of the medicinal saint was\r\nnecessary; in less vexatious maladies, the bare imposition of hands,\r\naccompanied by plaintive prayer, quickly healed the diseased.[11]\r\n\r\nAs early as the fifth century before Christ, Hippocrates of Cos\r\nasserted that madness was simply a disease of the brain, but\r\nnotwithstanding the reiteration of this scientific truth the church\r\nrepudiated it, and as late as the Reformation, Martin Luther\r\nmaintained that not only was insanity caused by diabolical influences,\r\nbut that \"Satan produces all the maladies which afflict mankind.\" Even\r\nmuch later, however, when other diseases were assigned a physical\r\norigin, insanity was still thought to be demoniacal possession. As\r\nlate as Bossuet's time, lunacy was thought to be the work of demons.\r\nThe cultured and progressive Bishop of Meaux, while trying to throw\r\noff the shackles of superstition, delivered and published two great\r\nsermons in which demoniacal possession is defended. To show how the\r\nidea has clung, notwithstanding the advancement and enlightenment of\r\nlate years, we may notice a trial which took place at Wemding, in\r\nsouthern Germany, in 1892, of which White tells us.\r\n\r\n   \"A boy had become hysterical, and the Capuchin Father\r\n   Aurelian tried to exorcise him, and charged a peasant's\r\n   wife, Frau Herz, with bewitching him, on evidence that\r\n   would have cost the woman her life at any time during\r\n   the seventeenth century. Thereupon the woman's husband\r\n   brought suit against Father Aurelian for slander. The\r\n   latter urged in his defence that the boy was possessed\r\n   of an evil spirit, if anybody ever was; that what had\r\n   been said and done was in accordance with the rules and\r\n   regulations of the Church, as laid down in decrees,\r\n   formulas, and rituals sanctioned by popes, councils,\r\n   and innumerable bishops during ages. All in vain. The\r\n   court condemned the good father to fine and\r\n   imprisonment.\"[12]\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from quoting in this connection the now famous\r\nepitaph of Lord Westbury's, suggested by the decision given by him as\r\nLord Chancellor in the case against Mr. Wilson in which it was charged\r\nthat the latter denied the doctrine of eternal punishment. The court\r\ndecided that it did \"not find in the formularies of the English Church\r\nany such distinct declaration upon the subject as to require it to\r\npunish the expression of a hope by a clergyman that even the ultimate\r\npardon of the wicked who are condemned in the day of judgment may be\r\nconsistent with the will of Almighty God.\" The following is the\r\nepitaph:\r\n\r\n          \"RICHARD BARON WESTBURY,\r\n      Lord High Chancellor of England.\r\n        He was an eminent Christian,\r\n     An energetic and merciful Statesman,\r\n  And a still more eminent and merciful Judge.\r\n    During his three years' tenure of office\r\nHe abolished the ancient method of conveying land,\r\nThe time-honored institution of the Insolvents' Court,\r\n                   And\r\n         The Eternity of Punishment.\r\n   Toward the close of his earthly career,\r\nIn the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,\r\n       He dismissed Hell with costs,\r\n  And took away from Orthodox members of the\r\n            Church of England\r\n Their last hope of everlasting damnation.\"[13]\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages there was a strange and incongruous mixture of\r\nmedicine and exorcism. Notice the following prescriptions:\r\n\r\n  \"If an elf or a goblin come, smear his forehead with\r\n  this salve, put it on his eyes, cense him with incense,\r\n  and sign him frequently with the sign of the cross.\"\r\n\r\n  \"For a fiend-sick man: When a devil possesses a man, or\r\n  controls him from within with disease, a spew-drink of\r\n  lupin, bishopwort, henbane, garlic. Pound these\r\n  together, add ale and holy water.\"\r\n\r\n  \"A drink for a fiend-sick man, to be drunk out of a\r\n  church bell: Githrife, cynoglossum, yarrow, lupin,\r\n  flower-de-luce, fennel, lichen, lovage. Work up to a\r\n  drink with clear ale, sing seven masses over it, add\r\n  garlic and holy water, and let the possessed sing the\r\n  _Beati Immaculati_; then let him drink the dose out of a\r\n  church bell, and let the priest sing over him the\r\n  _Domine Sancte Pater Omnipotens_.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThree methods of driving out demons from the insane were used: the\r\nmain weapon against the devil and his angels has always been exorcism\r\nby means of ecclesiastical formula and signs. These formulas\r\ndegenerated at one time to the vilest cursings, threatenings, and\r\nvulgarities. A second means was by an effort to disgust the demon and\r\nwound his pride. This might simply precede the exorcism proper. To\r\naccomplish this purpose of offending the demons, the most blasphemous\r\nand obscene epithets were used by the exorcist, which were allowable\r\nand perfectly proper when addressing demons. Most of these are so\r\nindecent that they cannot be printed, but the following are some\r\nexamples:\r\n\r\n  \"Thou lustful and stupid one,... thou lean sow,\r\n  famine-stricken and most impure,... thou wrinkled beast,\r\n  thou mangy beast, thou beast of all beasts the most\r\n  beastly,... thou mad spirit,... thou bestial and foolish\r\n  drunkard,... most greedy wolf,... most abominable\r\n  whisperer,... thou sooty spirit from Tartarus!... I cast\r\n  thee down, O Tartarean boor,... into the infernal\r\n  kitchen!... Loathsome cobbler,... dingy collier,...\r\n  filthy sow (_scrofa stercorata_),... perfidious boar,...\r\n  envious crocodile,... malodorous drudge,... wounded\r\n  basilisk,... rust-colored asp,... swollen toad,...\r\n  entangled spider,... lousy swineherd (_porcarie\r\n  pedicose_),... lowest of the low,... cudgelled ass,\"\r\n  etc.[15]\r\n\r\nThe pride of the demon was also to be wounded by the use of the\r\nvilest-smelling drugs, by trampling underfoot and spitting upon the\r\npicture of the devil, or even by sprinkling upon it foul compounds.\r\nSome even tried to scare the demon by using large-sounding words and\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe third method of exorcism was punishment. The attempt was\r\nfrequently made to scourge the demon out of the body. The exorcism was\r\nmore effective if the name of the demon could be ascertained. If\r\nsuccessful in procuring the name, it was written on a piece of paper\r\nand burned in a fire previously blessed, which caused the demons to\r\nsuffer all the torments in the accompanying exorcisms. All forms of\r\ntorture were employed, and in the great cities of Europe, \"witch\r\ntowers,\" where witches and demoniacs were tortured, and \"fool towers,\"\r\nwhere the more gentle lunatics were imprisoned, may still be seen.\r\nThe treatment of the insane in the Middle Ages is one of the darkest\r\nblots on the growing civilization.\r\n\r\nThe exorcism being completed, when some of the weaker demons were put\r\nto flight an after service was held in which everything belonging to\r\nthe patient was exorcised, so that the demon might not hide there and\r\nreturn to the patient. The exorcised demons were forbidden to return,\r\nand the demons remaining in the body were commanded to leave all the\r\nremainder of the body, and to descend into the little toe of the right\r\nfoot, and there to rest quietly.\r\n\r\nAfter the Reformation, two contests shaped themselves in the matter of\r\nexorcisms. The Protestants and the Roman Catholics vied with each\r\nother in the power, rapidity, and duration of the exorcisms. Both put\r\nforth miraculous claims, and with as much energy denied the power of\r\nthe other. They agreed in one thing, and that was the erroneous\r\nposition and teaching of the physicians. This, however, was but a\r\ncontinuation of that rivalry between the advancement of science and\r\nthe conservation of theology, which is as old as history. In our\r\nexamination of the influence of Christianity upon mental healing, it\r\nmay be well for us to glance at the discouraging attitude of\r\nChristianity toward medicine.[16]\r\n\r\nThe usurpation of healing by the church, which was a most serious\r\ndrawback to the therapeutic art, will be traced in the following\r\nchapters; there are, however, some other ways in which the church\r\nretarded the work of physicians. Chief among these was the theory\r\npropagated by Christians that it was unlawful to meddle with the\r\nbodies of the dead. This theory came down from ancient times, but was\r\neagerly accepted by the church, principally on account of the doctrine\r\nof the bodily resurrection. In addition to this, surgery was forbidden\r\nbecause the Church of Rome adopted the maxim that \"the church abhors\r\nthe shedding of blood.\" A recent English historian has remarked that\r\nof all organizations in human history, the Church of Rome has caused\r\nthe spilling of most innocent blood, but it refused to allow the\r\nsurgeons to spill a drop.\r\n\r\nMonks were prohibited the practice of surgery in 1248, and by\r\nsubsequent councils, and all dissections were considered sacrilege.\r\nSurgery was considered dishonorable until the fifteenth or sixteenth\r\ncenturies. The use of medicine was also discouraged. Down through the\r\ncenturies a few churchmen and many others, especially Jews and Arabs,\r\ntook up the study. The church authorities did everything possible to\r\nthwart it. Supernatural means were so abundant that the use of drugs\r\nwas not only irreligious but superfluous. Monks who took medicine were\r\npunished, and physicians in the thirteenth century could not treat\r\npatients without calling in ecclesiastical advice.\r\n\r\nWe are told that in the reign of Philip II of Spain a famous Spanish\r\ndoctor was actually condemned by the Inquisition to be burnt for\r\nhaving performed a surgical operation, and it was only by royal favor\r\nthat he was permitted instead to expiate his crime by a pilgrimage to\r\nthe Holy Land, where he died in poverty and exile.\r\n\r\nThis restriction was continued for three centuries, and consequently\r\nthrew medical work into the hands of charlatans among Christians, and\r\nof Jews. The clergy of the city of Hall protested that \"it were better\r\nto die with Christ than to be cured by a Jew doctor aided by the\r\ndevil.\" The Jesuit professor, Stengal, said that God permits illness\r\nbecause of His wish to glorify Himself through the miracles wrought by\r\nthe church, and His desire to test the faith of men by letting them\r\nchoose between the holy aid of the church and the illicit resort to\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nThere was another reason for the antagonism of the church to\r\nphysicians; the physicians in this case were inside the church. The\r\nmonks converted medicine to the basest uses. In connection with the\r\nauthority of the church, it was employed for extorting money from the\r\nsick. They knew little or nothing about medicine, so used charms,\r\namulets, and relics in healing. The ignorance and cupidity of the\r\nmonks led the Lateran Council, under the pontificate of Calixtus II,\r\nin 1123, to forbid priests and monks to attend the sick otherwise than\r\nas ministers of religion. It had little or no effect, so that Innocent\r\nII, in a council at Rheims in 1131, enforced the decree prohibiting\r\nthe monks frequenting schools of medicine, and directing them to\r\nconfine their practice to their own monasteries. They still disobeyed,\r\nand a Lateran Council in 1139 threatened all who neglected its orders\r\nwith the severest penalties and suspension from the exercise of all\r\necclesiastical functions; such practices were denounced as a neglect\r\nof the sacred objects of their profession in exchange for ungodly\r\nlucre. When the priests found that they could no longer confine the\r\npractice of medicine to themselves, it was stigmatized and denounced.\r\nAt the Council of Tours in 1163, Alexander III maintained that through\r\nmedicine the devil tried to seduce the priesthood, and threatened with\r\nexcommunication any ecclesiastic who studied medicine. In 1215,\r\nInnocent III fulminated an anathema against surgery and any priest\r\npractising it. Even this was not effectual.[17]\r\n\r\nWhat we see in connection with dissection and surgery and medicine was\r\nrepeated at a later date with inoculation, vaccination, and\r\nanaesthetics. There were the same objections by the church on\r\ntheological grounds, the same stubborn battle, and the same\r\ninevitable defeat of the theological position.\r\n\r\nSo long as disease was attributed to a demoniacal cause, so long did\r\nexorcisms and other miraculous cures continue, and so far as these\r\ncures were efficacious, they must be classed as mental healing.\r\nProbably they continued longer in insanity and mental derangement on\r\naccount of the beneficent and soothing effect of religion upon a\r\ndiseased mind. Priestly cures of all kinds were largely, if not\r\nwholly, suggestive, and no history of mental healing would be complete\r\nwithout a resume of ecclesiastical therapeutics. Many vagaries of\r\nhealing which the church introduced might be mentioned to show to what\r\nextent the people may be misled in the name of religion. For example,\r\nthe doctrine of signatures, to be later discussed, was disseminated by\r\npriests and monks, and if these medicines were ever effective it must\r\nhave been by mental means.\r\n\r\nThe demon theory of disease, which began before the age of history,\r\nand continued down through the savage ages and religions, through the\r\nearly civilizations, through the gospel history, and dominated early\r\nChristianity, was finally, in the sixteenth century, to be vigorously\r\nassailed and largely overcome. The cost of this was considerable;\r\nattached as it was to the Christian church, it seemed necessary to\r\ndestroy the whole Christian fabric in order to unravel this one\r\nthread. Atheism, therefore, was rampant, and science and atheism\r\nbecame almost synonymous, and continued so until the church freed\r\nscience from its centuries of bondage and allowed it to develop so as\r\nto be again in these days a co-laborer.\r\n\r\nIn pleasing contrast to the destructive and deterrent efforts of the\r\nchurch against the development of medicine is the helpful care of the\r\nsick exercised by Christians. The example of Jesus as shown by his\r\ntender sympathy, his helpful acts, and his instruction to his\r\nfollowers, bore fruit in the relief and care of sufferers by\r\nindividuals and religious asylums. About the year 1000 and later, the\r\ninfirmaries which were attached to numerous monasteries, and the\r\n_hospitia_ along the routes of travel which opened their doors to sick\r\npilgrims, were but the development of a less portentous attempt on the\r\npart of individuals and societies to care for the sick. The Knights of\r\nSt. John, or the Hospitalers as they were called, assumed as their\r\nspecial duty the nursing and doctoring of those in need of such\r\nattention, especially of sick and infirm pilgrims and crusaders.\r\n\r\nHospitals for the sick, orphanages for foundlings, and great\r\ninstitutions for the proper care of paupers developed with immense\r\nstrides, and during the twelfth century expanded into gigantic\r\nproportions. In the ensuing age, the mediaeval mind was fired with a\r\nfaith in the efficacy of unstinted charity; members of society, from\r\nholy pontiff to the humblest recluse by the wayside, rivalled each\r\nother in gratuities of clothing and food, founding of hospitals, and\r\nendowment of beneficent public institutions. St. Louis's highest claim\r\nto pious glory arose from his restless and unstinted charities to the\r\nindigent and sick. Even the lepers, which were shunned or segregated,\r\nwere treated by Christian institutions; and saints and saintesses\r\nfound pious expression for their humility in personal attendance and\r\neven loving embraces of these unsightly beings covered with repulsive\r\nsores. For the last millennium there has not been a time when\r\nChristian love and benevolence have not sought the opportunity of\r\nministering to the sick.\r\n\r\nOne can easily recognize the effect which this fact would have on\r\nmental healing. The church fostered the ideas of exorcism and the\r\ncures by relics and shrines, and deprecated the use of medicine. If\r\nthe hospitals and infirmaries were almost wholly in the hands of the\r\nmonks and churchmen, there was little hope for the development of\r\nother than ecclesiastical mental healing. The untold good which\r\nChristian ministrations to the sick accomplished must be acknowledged,\r\nbut it was not an unmixed benefit to the race as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe may more easily see, perhaps, the connection between the church and\r\nthe development of medicine, and the despotic power of the church in\r\nthis regard, when we remember that physicians were formerly a part of\r\nthe clergy, and it was not until 1542 that the papal legate in France\r\ngave them permission to marry. In 1552 the doctors in law obtained\r\nlike permission. An early priestly physician has survived to fame by\r\nthe name of Elpideus, sometimes confused with Elpidius Rusticus. He\r\nwas both a deacon of the church and a skilled surgeon, and was very\r\nfavorably mentioned by St. Ennodius as a person of fine culture. He\r\nwas sufficiently dexterous and skilful to heal the Gothic ruler,\r\nTheodoric, of a grievous illness.[18] Salverte gives us additional\r\nexamples: \"Richard Fitz-Nigel, who died Bishop of London, in 1198, had\r\nbeen apothecary to Henry II. The celebrated Roger Bacon, who\r\nflourished in the thirteenth century, although a monk, yet practised\r\nmedicine. Nicolas de Farnham, a physician to Henry III, was created\r\nBishop of Durham; and many doctors of medicine were at various times\r\nelevated to ecclesiastical dignities.\"[19]\r\n\r\nThe grip of the church accomplished its purpose, and science,\r\nespecially the science of medicine, was strangled, almost to the\r\ndeath. Even the people of the time recognized the shortcomings of the\r\nphysicians. Henricus Cornelius Agrippa (1486-1535), writing in 1530,\r\nsaid with pleasant irony that physic was \"a certaine Arte of\r\nmanslaughter,\" and that \"well neare alwaies there is more daunger in\r\nthe Physition and the Medicine than in the sicknesse itselfe.\" He also\r\ngives the following picture of a fashionable doctor of his time: \"Clad\r\nin brave apparaile, having ringes on his fingers glimmeringe with\r\npretious stoanes, and which hath gotten fame and credence for having\r\nbeen in farre countries, or having an obstinate manner of vaunting\r\nwith stiffe lies that he hath great remedies, and for having\r\ncontinually in his mouth many wordes halfe Greeke and barbarous....\r\nBut this will prove to be true, that Physitians moste commonlye be\r\nnaught. They have one common honour with the hangman, that is to saye,\r\nto kill menne and to be recompensed therefore.\"[20]\r\n\r\n  [3] A. D.

In addition to this, the missionary efforts and\r\nsuccesses of the church had some influence in establishing and\r\ncontinuing cures by relics and similar means. The missionaries found\r\nthat their converts had formerly employed various amulets and charms\r\nfor the healing of diseases, and that they continued to have great\r\nfaith in them for that purpose. To wean them from their heathen\r\ncustoms, Christian amulets and charms had to be substituted, or, as\r\nwas sometimes the case, the heathen fetich was continued, but with a\r\nChristian significance.\r\n\r\nThe early Scandinavians carried effigies carved out of gold or silver\r\nas safeguards against disease, or applied those made out of certain\r\nother materials, as the mandragora root or linen or wood, to the\r\ndiseased part as a cure of physical infirmities. Some of these images\r\nwere carried over into Christianity, for in Charlemagne's time,\r\nheadache was frequently cured by following the saintly recommendation\r\nto shape the figure of a head and place it on a cross. Fort tells us\r\nthat \"The introduction of Christianity among the Teutonic races\r\noffered no hindrance to a perpetuation, under new forms, of those\r\nsocial observances with which Norse temple idolatry was so intimately\r\nassociated. Offering to proselytes an unlimited number of demoniacal\r\naeons, similar in individuality and prowess to those peopling the\r\ninvisible universe, Northern mythology readily united with Christian\r\ndemonology.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThe relics of the saints came to be the favorite substitute for the\r\nheathen charms. With the acceptance of the demoniacal cause of\r\ndisease, exorcism by relics gradually grew in importance until it was\r\nfirmly established and a preferred form in the sixth and subsequent\r\ncenturies. Down to this time there still existed a feeble recognition\r\nof a possible system adapted to the cure of maladies, so far, perhaps,\r\nas the practice was restricted to municipalities. The rapid\r\nadvancement of saintly remedies, consecrated oils, and other puissant\r\narticles of ecclesiastical appliance, enabled and encouraged numerous\r\nchurchmen to exercise the AEsculapian art; this, together with the ban\r\nput upon physicians and scientific means, soon gave the church the\r\nmonopoly of healing. Perhaps the most thorough attestation of the\r\ncontempt into which physicians had fallen, compared with saintly\r\nmedicists, is the fact that cures were invariably attempted after\r\nearthly medicine had been exhausted.[22]\r\n\r\nIslam, Buddhism, and other religions have their shrines where some\r\npilgrims are undoubtedly cured, but Christianity seems to have had the\r\nmost varied and numerous collection. As early as the latter part of\r\nthe fourth century miraculous powers were ascribed to the images of\r\nJesus and the saints which adorned the walls of most of the churches\r\nof the time, and tales of wonderful cures were related of them. The\r\nintercessions of saints were invoked, and their relics began to work\r\nmiracles.[23]\r\n\r\nSt. Cyril, St. Ambrose, St. Augustine, and others of the early church\r\nfathers of note maintained that the relics of the saints had great\r\nefficacy in the cure of diseases. St. Augustine tells us: \"Besides\r\nmany other miracles, that Gamaliel in a dream revealed to a priest\r\nnamed Lacianus the place where the bones of St. Stephen were buried;\r\nthat those bones being thus discovered, were brought to Hippo, the\r\ndiocese of which St. Augustine was bishop; that they raised five\r\npersons to life; and that, although only a portion of the miraculous\r\ncures they effected had been registered, the certificates drawn up in\r\ntwo years in the diocese, and by the orders of the saint, were nearly\r\nseventy. In the adjoining diocese of Calama they were incomparably\r\nmore numerous.\"[24] This great and intellectual man also mentions and\r\nevidently credits the story that some innkeeper of his time put a drug\r\ninto cheese which changed travellers who partook of it into domestic\r\nanimals, and he further asserts after a personal test that peacock's\r\nflesh will not decay.\r\n\r\nSt. Ambrose declared that \"the precepts of medicine are contrary to\r\ncelestial science, watching, and prayer.\" When the conflict between\r\nSt. Ambrose and the Arian Empress Justina was at its height, the\r\nformer declared that it had been revealed to him that relics were\r\nburied in a certain spot which he indicated. When the earth was\r\nremoved, there was exposed a tomb filled with blood, and containing\r\ntwo gigantic skeletons with their heads severed from their bodies.\r\nThese were pronounced to be the remains of St. Gervasius and St.\r\nProtasius, two martyrs of gigantic physical proportions, who were said\r\nto have been beheaded about three centuries before. To prove beyond\r\ndoubt the genuineness of these relics, a blind man was restored to\r\nsight by coming in contact with them, and demoniacs were also cured\r\nthereby. Before being exorcised, however, the demons, who were\r\nsupposed to have supernatural and indubitable knowledge, declared that\r\nthe relics were genuine; that St. Ambrose was the deadly enemy of\r\nhell; that the doctrine of the Trinity was true; and that those who\r\nrejected it would certainly be damned. To be sure that the testimony\r\nof the demons should have its proper weight in the controversy, on the\r\nfollowing day St. Ambrose delivered an invective against all who\r\nquestioned the miracle.[25]\r\n\r\nLate researches concerning the Catacombs of Rome have thrown much\r\nlight upon the early use of relics. The former opinion of the\r\nCatacombs was that they were used for secret worship by the persecuted\r\nChristians, but now we know that they were burial-places under the\r\nprotection of Roman law, with entrances opening on the public roads.\r\nTheir chapels and altars were for memorial and communion services.\r\nGreat reverence was felt for the bodies of all Christians, so that for\r\nthe first seven centuries the bodies were not disturbed, and relics,\r\nin the modern sense of the word, were unknown. People prayed at the\r\ntombs, or if they wished to take something away, they touched the tomb\r\nwith a handkerchief, or else they took some oil from the lamps which\r\nmarked the tombs. These mementos were regarded as true relics, so that\r\nwhen the Lombard Queen, Theodelinda, sent the abbot John for relics to\r\nput in her cathedral at Monza, he came back with over seventy little\r\nvials of oil, each with the name of the saint from whose tomb the oil\r\nwas procured, and many of them are still preserved.\r\n\r\nThe oil from altar lamps was of therapeutic value, as St. Chrysostom\r\ntells us in speaking of the superiority of the church over ordinary\r\nhouses. \"For what is here,\" he asks, \"that is not great and awful?\r\nThus both this Table [the altar] is far more precious and delightful\r\nthan that [any table at home], and this lamp than that; and this they\r\nknow, as many as have put away diseases by anointing themselves with\r\noil in faith and due season.\" If the body of a saint lay beneath the\r\naltar, the oil was then known as the \"Oil of the Saints,\" and was even\r\nmore efficacious for healing. Notice the following quotations on the\r\nsubject taken from Dearmer's work.\r\n\r\n   \"Far more common are stories of healing by oil from a\r\n   lamp burnt in honor of Christ or the saints. The\r\n   following examples are from the East. The wounded hand\r\n   of a Saracen was healed by oil from a lamp before the\r\n   icon of St. George.\"\r\n\r\n   \"St. Cyrus and St. John appeared to a person suffering\r\n   from gout, and bade him take a little oil in a small\r\n   ampulla from the lamp that burnt before the image of\r\n   the Saviour, in the great tetrapyle at Alexandria, and\r\n   anoint his feet with it.\"\r\n\r\n   \"Similar stories are found in Western writers. Thus\r\n   Nicetius of Lyons, by means of the oil of the lamp\r\n   which burnt daily at his sepulchre, restored sight to\r\n   the blind, drove demons from bodies possessed, restored\r\n   soundness to shrunken limbs,\" etc.\r\n\r\n   \"An epileptic was cured by oil from the lamp that burnt\r\n   night and day at the tomb of St. Severin.\"\r\n\r\n  \"It was revealed to a blind woman, that oil from the\r\n  lamp of St. Genevieve would restore her sight, if the\r\n  warden of the church were to anoint her with it. A week\r\n  after she brought a blind man, who was healed in the\r\n  same manner.\"[26]\r\n\r\nAt the time of Gregory of Tours, application was made of sainted\r\nreliquaries as a remedy against the devil and his demons. Gregory\r\nnarrates the miraculous efficacy of a small pellet of wax, taken from\r\nthe tomb of St. Martin, in extinguishing an incendiary fire started by\r\nhis Satanic majesty, which was instigated by malicious envy, because\r\nthis omnipotent talisman was in the custody of an ecclesiastic! This\r\nTuronese bishop records many instances of cures being effected at\r\nMartin's tomb. He himself was relieved of severe pains in the head by\r\ntouching the disordered spot with the sombre pall of St. Martin's\r\nsepulchre. This remedy was applied on three different occasions with\r\nequal success. Once he was cured of an attack of mortal dysentery by\r\nsimply dissolving into a glass of water a pinch of dust scraped from\r\nthe tomb of St. Martin and drinking the strange concoction. At another\r\ntime, his tongue having become swollen and tumefied, it was restored\r\nto its natural size and condition by licking the railing of the tomb\r\nof this saint. He knew of others who had been equally successful. An\r\narchdeacon, named Leonastes had sight restored to his blind eyes at\r\nthe tomb of St. Martin, but unfortunately the fact that he later\r\napplied to an Israelitish physician caused his infirmity to return.\r\nEven a toothache was cured by St. Martin's relics.\r\n\r\nThe following is an apostrophe to the relics of St. Martin by Bishop\r\nGregory: \"Oh ineffable theriac! ineffable pigment! admirable antidote!\r\ncelestial purge! superior to all drugs of the faculty! sweeter than\r\naromatics! stronger than unguents together; thou cleanest the stomach\r\nlike scammony, the lungs like hyssop, thou purgest the head like\r\npyre-thrig!\"[27]\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the fifth century the exercise of the medical art was\r\nalmost exclusively appropriated by cloisters and monasteries, whose\r\noccupants boldly vended the miraculous remedial properties of relics,\r\nchrism, baptismal fluids, holy oil, rosy crosses, etc., as of\r\nunquestioned virtue. In these early days living saints seem to have\r\nrivalled dead ones in their power over diseases, but of these we shall\r\nspeak in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nA renewed interest sprang up when pilgrims began to return from their\r\njourneys to Palestine, bringing with them, as was natural, some\r\nsouvenirs of their sojourn. A most interesting quotation from Mackay\r\nreveals the condition of these times. \"The first pilgrims to the Holy\r\nLand brought back to Europe thousands of apocryphal relics, in the\r\npurchase of which they had expended all their store. The greatest\r\nfavorite was the wood of the true cross, which, like the oil of the\r\nwidow, never diminished. It is generally asserted, in the traditions\r\nof the Romish Church, that the Empress Helen, the mother of\r\nConstantine the Great, first discovered the veritable '_true cross_'\r\nin her pilgrimage to Jerusalem. The Emperor Theodosius made a present\r\nof the greater part of it to St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan, by whom it\r\nwas studded with precious stones and deposited in the principal church\r\nof that city. It was carried away by the Huns, by whom it was burnt,\r\nafter they had extracted the valuable jewels it contained. Fragments,\r\npurporting to have been cut from it, were, in the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies, to be found in almost every church in Europe, and would, if\r\ncollected together in one place, have been almost sufficient to have\r\nbuilt a cathedral. Happy was the sinner who could get a sight of one\r\nof them; happier he who possessed one! To obtain them the greatest\r\ndangers were cheerfully braved. They were thought to preserve from all\r\nevils and to cure the most inveterate diseases. Annual pilgrimages\r\nwere made to the shrines that contained them and considerable revenues\r\ncollected from the devotees.\r\n\r\n\"Next in renown were those precious relics, the tears of the Saviour.\r\nBy whom and in what manner they were preserved, the pilgrim did not\r\nenquire. Their genuineness was vouched by the Christians of the Holy\r\nLand, and that was sufficient. Tears of the Virgin Mary, and tears of\r\nSt. Peter, were also to be had, carefully enclosed in little caskets,\r\nwhich the pious might wear in their bosoms. After the tears, the next\r\nmost precious relics were drops of the blood of Jesus and the martyrs,\r\nand the milk of the Virgin Mary. Hair and toe-nails were also in great\r\nrepute, and were sold at extravagant prices. Thousands of pilgrims\r\nannually visited Palestine in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, to\r\npurchase pretended relics for the home market. The majority of them\r\nhad no other means of subsistence than the profits thus obtained. Many\r\na nail, cut from the filthy foot of some unscrupulous ecclesiastic,\r\nwas sold at a diamond's price, within six months after its severance\r\nfrom its parent toe, upon the supposition that it had once belonged to\r\na saint or an apostle. Peter's toes were uncommonly prolific, for\r\nthere were nails enough in Europe, at the time of the Council of\r\nClermont, to have filled a sack, all of which were devoutly believed\r\nto have grown on the sacred feet of that great apostle. Some of them\r\nare still shown in the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle. The pious come\r\nfrom a distance of a hundred German miles to feast their eyes upon\r\nthem.\"[28]\r\n\r\nWhile some of these relics enumerated by Mackay seem to be such\r\napparent frauds that none could credit them, they were surpassed in\r\naudacity by one offered for sale at a monastery in Jerusalem. Here\r\nwas presented to the prospective buyers one of the fingers of the Holy\r\nGhost.[29]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the popular relics already noted, an extensive and\r\nlucrative trade was carried on in iron filings from the chains with\r\nwhich, it was claimed, Peter and Paul were bound. These filings were\r\ndeemed by Pope Gregory I as efficacious in healing as were the bones\r\nof saints or martyrs.[30]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURE THROUGH THE INTERCESSION OF A HEALING SAINT]\r\n\r\nAs an example of healing at shrines in early days, I will reproduce\r\nBede's description of a cure effected at the tomb of St. Cuthbert in\r\n698. \"There was in that same monastery a brother whose name was\r\nBethwegan, who had for a considerable time waited upon the guests of\r\nthe house, and is still living, having the testimony of all the\r\nbrothers and strangers resorting thither, of being a man of much piety\r\nand religion, and serving the office put upon him only for the sake of\r\nthe heavenly reward. This man, having on a certain day washed the\r\nmantels or garments which he used in the hospital, in the sea, was\r\nreturning home, when on a sudden about halfway, he was seized with a\r\nsudden distemper in his body, insomuch that he fell down, and having\r\nlain some time, he could scarcely rise again. When at last he got up,\r\nhe felt one-half of his body from the head to the foot, struck with\r\npalsy, and with much difficulty he got home with the help of a staff.\r\nThe distemper increased by degrees, and as night approached became\r\nstill worse, so that when day returned, he could not rise or walk\r\nalone. In this weak condition, a good thought came into his mind,\r\nwhich was to go to church, the best way he could, to the tomb of the\r\nreverend Father Cuthbert, and there on his knees, to beg of the Divine\r\nGoodness either to be delivered from that disease, if it were for his\r\ngood, or if the Divine Providence had ordained him longer to lie under\r\nthe same for his punishment, that he might bear the pain with patience\r\nand a composed mind. He did accordingly, and supporting his weak limbs\r\nwith a staff, entered the church, and prostrating himself before the\r\nbody of the man of God, he with pious earnestness, prayed, that\r\nthrough his intercession, our Lord might be propitious to him. In the\r\nmidst of his prayers he fell as it were, into a stupor, and as he was\r\nafterwards wont to relate, felt a large and broad hand touch his head\r\nwhere the pain lay, and by that touch all the part of his body which\r\nhad been affected with the distemper, was delivered from the weakness,\r\nand restored to health down to his feet. He then awoke, and rose up in\r\nperfect health, and returning thanks to God for his recovery, told the\r\nbrothers what had happened to him; and to the joy of them all,\r\nreturned the more zealously, as if chastened by his affliction, to\r\nthe service which he was wont before so carefully to perform. The very\r\ngarments which had been on Cuthbert's body, dedicated to God, either\r\nwhile living, or after he was dead, were not exempt from the virtue of\r\nperforming cures, as may be seen in the book of his life and miracles,\r\nby such as shall read it.\"[31] It should be noticed that in this\r\naccount God alone seemed to have been the healer.\r\n\r\nNearly every country had its long list of saints, each with his\r\nspecial power over some organ or disease. This saintly power, however,\r\nwas not applied directly, but through their relics or through shrines\r\nconsecrated to them. Melton, in his _Astrologaster_, says: \"The saints\r\nof the Romanists have usurped the place of the zodiacal constellations\r\nin their governance of the parts of man's body, and that 'for every\r\nlimbe they have a saint.' Thus St. Otilia keepes the head instead of\r\nAries; St. Blasius is appointed to governe the necke instead of\r\nTaurus; St. Lawrence keepes the backe and shoulders instead of Gemini,\r\nCancer, and Leo; St. Erasmus rules the belly with the entrayles, in\r\nthe place of Libra and Scorpius; in the stead of Sagittarius,\r\nCapricornus, Aquarius, and Pisces, the holy church of Rome hath\r\nelected St. Burgarde, St. Rochus, St. Quirinus, St. John, and many\r\nothers, which governe the thighes, feet, shinnes, and knees.\"\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the saints is distributed more minutely, as\r\n_e. g._, \"_Right Hand_: the top joint of the thumb is dedicated to God,\r\nthe second joint to the Virgin; the top joint of the fore-finger to\r\nSt. Barnabas, the second joint to St. John, and the third to St. Paul;\r\nthe top joint of the second finger to Simon Cleophas, the second joint\r\nto Tathideo, the third to Joseph; the top joint of the third finger to\r\nZaccheus, the second to Stephen, the third to the evangelist Luke; the\r\ntop joint of the little finger to Leatus, the second to Mark, the\r\nthird to Nicodemus.\" Thus the body was cared for.\r\n\r\nPettigrew makes the following enumeration which shows the division of\r\nlabor among the saints in the Middle Ages. In this, not the different\r\nportions of the body but the various diseases and infirmities are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n\"The following list, though doubtless very imperfect, will yet serve to\r\nshow how general was the appropriation of particular diseases to the\r\nRoman Catholic saints:\r\n\r\n  St. Agatha, against sore breasts.\r\n  St. Agnan and St. Tignan, against scald head.\r\n  St. Anthony, against inflammations.\r\n  St. Apollonia, against toothache.\r\n  St. Avertin, against lunacy.\r\n  St. Benedict, against the stone, and also for poisons.\r\n  St. Blaise, against the quinsey, bones sticking in the throat, etc.\r\n  St. Christopher and St. Mark, against sudden death.\r\n  St. Clara, against sore eyes.\r\n  St. Erasmus, against the colic.\r\n  St. Eutrope, against dropsy.\r\n  St. Genow and St. Maur, against the gout.\r\n  St. Germanus, against diseases of children.\r\n  St. Giles and St. Hyacinth, against sterility.\r\n  St. Herbert, against hydrophobia.\r\n  St. Job and St. Fiage, against syphilis.\r\n  St. John, against epilepsy and poison.\r\n  St. Lawrence, against diseases of the back and shoulders.\r\n  St. Liberius, against the stone and fistula.\r\n  St. Maine, against the scab.\r\n  St. Margaret and St. Edine, against danger in parturition.\r\n  St. Martin, against the itch.\r\n  St. Marus, against palsy and convulsions.\r\n  St. Otilia and St. Juliana, against sore eyes and\r\n  the headache.\r\n  St. Pernel, against the ague.\r\n  St. Petronilla, St. Apollonia, and St. Lucy, against the toothache.\r\n  ----, and St. Genevieve, against fevers.\r\n  St. Phaire, against hemorrhoids.\r\n  St. Quintan, against coughs.\r\n  St. Rochus, and St. Sebastian, against the plague.\r\n  St. Romanus, against demoniacal possession.\r\n  St. Ruffin, against madness.\r\n  St. Sigismund, against fevers and agues.\r\n  St. Valentine, against epilepsy.\r\n  St. Venise, against chlorosis.\r\n  St. Vitus, against madness and poisons.\r\n  St. Wallia and St. Wallery, against the stone.\r\n  St. Wolfgang, against lameness.\"[32]\r\n\r\nWax from the tapers illuminating the altar which enclosed St. Gall's\r\nmortal remains was an instantaneous cure for toothache, diseased eyes,\r\nand total deafness; a vase used by the martyred Willabrod for bathing\r\nthrice a year, still holding its partially solidified water by divine\r\ninvocation after her death, had great remedial energy in diverse\r\nailments; the water in which the ring of St. Remigius was immersed\r\ncured certain obstinate fevers; and the wine in which the bones of the\r\nsaints were washed restored imbeciles to instant health. In the\r\nthirteenth century, hairs of saints, especially of St. Boniface, were\r\nused as a purge, and a single hair from the beard of St. Vincent,\r\nplaced about the neck of an idiot, restored normal mental operations.\r\nWith the water in which St. Sulpicius washed her hands aggravated\r\ninfirmities were instantly cured; and in the twelfth century, an\r\ninvalid being advised in a dream to drink the water in which St.\r\nBernard washed his hands, the Abbot of Clairvaux went to him, gave him\r\nthe wash water, and healed an incurable disease. Flowers reposing on\r\nthe tomb of a saint, when steeped in water, were supposed to be\r\nespecially efficacious in various diseases, and those blooming in\r\naromatic beauty at the tomb of St. Bernard instantly cured grievous\r\nsicknesses.[33] The belt of St. Guthlac, and the belt of St. Thomas\r\nof Lancaster, were sovereign remedies for the headache, whilst the\r\npenknife and boots of Archbishop Becket, and a piece of his shirt,\r\nwere found most admirably to aid parturition. Fragments of the veil of\r\nthe saintess Coleta, and the use of her well-worn cloak, immediately\r\ncured a terrible luxation, and a cataleptic patient was restored to\r\nsanity by drinking from her cup.\r\n\r\nTo show how thoroughly the idea of the efficacy of these relics must\r\nhave been indued in the thought of the times, White quotes the\r\nfollowing: \"Two lazy beggars, one blind, the other lame, try to avoid\r\nthe relics of St. Martin, borne about in procession, so that they may\r\nnot be healed and lose their claim to alms. The blind man takes the\r\nlame man on his shoulders to guide him, but they are caught in the\r\ncrowd and healed against their will.\" He also says: \"Even as late as\r\n1784 we find certain authorities in Bavaria ordering that anyone\r\nbitten by a mad dog shall at once put up prayers at the shrine of St.\r\nHubert, and not waste his time in any attempts at medical or surgical\r\ncure.\"[34]\r\n\r\nIn addition to what Dr. White says here about the treatment for\r\nthreatened hydrophobia in the eighteenth century, we find a curious\r\nmixture of science and superstition in the nineteenth century in\r\nconnection with the same trouble. Early in this century physicians\r\ndiscovered that the most effectual remedy against the bite of a rabid\r\nanimal was the cauterization of the wound with a red-hot iron. In\r\nTuscany, however, the iron which they heated was one of the nails of\r\nthe true cross, and in the French provinces it was the key of St.\r\nHubert. This, though, was only to be used in the hands of those who\r\ncould trace their genealogy to this noble saint. At the abbey of St.\r\nHubert, in the diocese of Liege, the intercession of the saint still\r\ncontinued to be sufficient to effect a cure, provided it was seconded\r\nby some religious ceremonies, and a diet which would reassure the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the \"true cross,\" portions of this relic were\r\nmuch used for aid in any emergency. In addition to sanitary and\r\nhealing powers, fragments suspended to a tree manifested the proper\r\nlocation of sacred edifices. St. Magnus, who seems to have carried\r\npieces around with him, completely vanquished demons who frequented a\r\nlocality selected for a chapel. Eyesight was restored to a humble\r\nmerchant seeking the blood-stained marks upon the chapel of this same\r\nSt. Magnus. The blind man was feeling his uncertain way to the place,\r\nwhere these discolorations reappeared more distinctly after each\r\nwashing with heavy layers of lime.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, almost in the agonies of earthly dissolution, with rigid\r\nbody, rigorous limbs, and fluctuating spirit, was brought to full\r\nhealth by the application to his moribund body of a piece of the true\r\ncross, about the year 1244; and later in the century miracles took\r\nplace at his tomb. M. Littre, in his _Fragment de Medecine\r\nRetrospective_, describes seven miracles which occurred at his tomb,\r\nsome of which cures, however, were very gradual. We are also told that\r\nwhen a humble hunchback bowed the knee in adoration at the tomb of St.\r\nAndreas, his irresistible faith instantly released him from his\r\nunnatural rotundity. In 1243 a Ferrara writer was at Padua, and while\r\nattending vespers at the tomb where the sainted body of the Minorite\r\nAnthony reposed, he affirms that he saw a person who had been mute\r\nfrom his birth recover his voice and speak audibly.\r\n\r\nSaintly remedies were used to cure hemorrhages, readjust luxations,\r\nunite fractures, remove calculi, moderate the agonizing pangs of\r\nparturition, restore vision to the blind, and hearing to the deaf--in\r\nfact, in an endeavor to perform cures which modern medicine and\r\nsurgery are counting among their greatest and most recent triumphs.\r\nSome things even more strange were attempted: paradoxical as it may\r\nseem, they were used to cover up crime. Fort tells us that among nuns\r\nand consecrated women in convents, some erring sisters applied the\r\npreventive talismanic influence of a sacred shirt or girdle to\r\nsuppress the manifestation of conventual irregularities of a sexual\r\ncharacter. Animals as well as human beings were treated for sickness,\r\nand relics were used to free captive birds and animals. At a banquet,\r\na costly urn was shattered by ecclesiastics, and through the power of\r\nOdilo it was restored to its original integrity. At the tombs of both\r\nSt. Severin and St. Gall, when the light had been quenched, miraculous\r\nfire burst forth to renew the splendor.[35]\r\n\r\nThe allotment of certain diseases to certain saints did not end with\r\nthe Middle Ages. I have in my hand a little manual entitled: _De\r\nl'Invocation miraculeuse des Saints dans les maladies et les besoins\r\nparticuliers, par Mme. la Baronne d'Avout_, published in 1884. An\r\ninvocation is given for every day in the year to some particular\r\nsaint, who is thought to be especially efficacious in the cure of some\r\nspecific disease. I shall quote but one for illustration.\r\n\r\n  \"30 MAI\r\n  S. HUBERT DE BRETIGNY\r\n  Pres Noyons (Oise).\r\n  Honore au diocese de Beauvais.\r\n\r\n  \"L'illustre saint Hubert, apotre des Ardennes, fut son\r\n  protecteur et lui donna son nom. Il lui obtint les plus\r\n  heureuses dispositions pour la vertu. Lui aussi herita\r\n  du pouvoir de guerir de la rage.\r\n\r\n  \"Les habitants de Noyon et des environs n'ont pas cesse\r\n  de recourir a son intercession. Les personnes qui\r\n  touchent ses reliques ou portent sur elles son nom beni\r\n  esperent echapper pendant leur vie aux atteintes des\r\n  demons, de la rage et du tonnerre.\r\n\r\n  \"A Aire, diocese de Frejus, on invoque aussi sainte\r\n  Quitere contre la rage.\r\n\r\n  INVOCATION\r\n\r\n  \"Dieu tout-puissant, qui avez forme le coeur de vos\r\n  saints avec une admirable bonte, afin qu'ils deviennent\r\n  pour nous une source de bienfaits et de consolation;\r\n  assistez-nous dans le pressant besoin ou nous nous\r\n  trouvons et sauvez-nous de la mort, par les prieres at\r\n  les merites de saint Hubert de Bretigny, afin que nous\r\n  puissions vous louer et vous benir. Par N.-S. J.-C.\r\n  Ainsi soit-il.\r\n\r\n  \"_Saint Hubert, qui preservez de la morsure des betes\r\n  enragees, ou qui guerissez leur morsures mortelles,\r\n  priez pour tous les affliges qui vous invoquent._\"\r\n\r\nWhile there was probably some advance when the saints of the church\r\ntook the place of the zodiacal constellations in the government of the\r\nhuman body, the church prevented the development along scientific\r\nlines, although there were many ramifications of saintly influence.\r\nNot the least among these was the healing efficacy of holy wells,\r\npools, and streams, which had been empowered in some way by the\r\nsaints. In some cases the bones of holy men have been buried in\r\ndifferent parts of the continent, and after a certain lapse of time,\r\nwater was said to have oozed from them, which soon formed a spring and\r\ncured all the diseases of the faithful.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the cure of leprous Naaman by bathing in the Jordan, and the\r\nrestoration of the sight of the blind man by washing in the Pool of\r\nSiloam may have served as examples which the credulous were only too\r\nready to follow. We must also note, however, as a reason for their\r\nuse, that in classical times the greater number of thermal waters,\r\nmore frequently used then than in the present day, remained\r\nconsecrated to the gods, to Apollo, to AEsculapius, and, above all, to\r\nHercules, who was named Iatricos, or the able physician. At any rate,\r\nmany wells and fountains were dedicated to different saints, and\r\nvarious rites were performed there at Easter and other particular\r\ndays, where offerings were also made to the saints.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, many such sacred places have been visited by the sick for\r\ncenturies, and England and Scotland have them also. Not only in the\r\nBritish Isles, but in all parts of Europe they were much frequented in\r\nthe Middle Ages, and they are not without their visitors to-day. As\r\nlate as 1805 the eminent Roman Catholic prelate, Dr. John Milner, gave\r\na detailed account of a miraculous cure performed at a sacred well in\r\nFlintshire. Gregory of Tours was one of the first to notice the\r\nhealing power of springs in connection with the saints. He asserted\r\nthat the diseases of the sick and infirm were banished upon the\r\ncontact of a few drops of water drawn from a spring dug by St.\r\nMartin's own hands.\r\n\r\nFrom Fosbrooke's _British Monachism_ we learn that \"on a spot called\r\nNell's Point, is a fine well, to which great numbers of women resort\r\non Holy Thursday, and, having washed their eyes in the spring, they\r\ndrop a pin into it. Once a year, at St. Mardrin's well, also, lame\r\npersons went on Corpus Christi evening, to lay some small offering on\r\nthe altar, there to lie on the ground all night, drink of the water\r\nthere, and on the next morning to take a good draught more of it, and\r\ncarry away some of the water each in a bottle at their departure. At\r\nMuswell Hill was formerly a chapel, called our Lady of Muswell, from a\r\nwell there, near which was her image; this well was continually\r\nresorted to by way of pilgrimage. At Walsingham, a fine green road was\r\nmade for the pilgrims, and there was a holy well and cross adjacent,\r\nat which pilgrims used to kneel while drinking the water. It is\r\nremarkable that the Anglo-Saxon laws had proscribed this as\r\nidolatrous. Such springs were consecrated upon the discovery of cures\r\neffected by them. In fact,\" Fosbrooke adds, \"these consecrated wells\r\nmerely imply a knowledge of the properties of mineral waters, but,\r\nthrough ignorance, a religious appropriation of their properties was\r\nmade to supernatural causes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holywell, in the county of Flint,\" we are informed by Salverte,\r\n\"derives its name from the Holy Well of St. Winifred, over which a\r\nchapel was erected by the Stanley family, in the reign of Henry VII.\r\nThe well was formerly in high repute as a medicinal spring. Pennant\r\nsays that, in his time, Lancashire pilgrims were to be seen in deep\r\ndevotion, standing in the waters up to the chin for hours, sending up\r\nprayers, and making a prescribed number of turnings; and this excess\r\nof piety was carried so far, as in several instances to cost the\r\ndevotees their lives.\"[36]\r\n\r\nPennant also tells us of a small spring outside the bathing well at\r\nWhiteford, which was once famed for the cure of weak eyes. The patient\r\nmade an offering of a crooked pin, and at the same time repeated some\r\nwords. The well still remains, but the efficacy of its waters is lost.\r\nIn recounting his tour of Wales, the same author describes the church\r\nof St. Tecla, virgin and martyr, at Llandegla. He says: \"About two\r\nhundred yards from the church, in a Quillet called Gwern Degla, rises\r\na small spring. The water is under the tutelage of the Saint, and to\r\nthis day held to be extremely beneficial in the falling sickness. The\r\npatient washes his limbs in the well; makes an offering into it of\r\nfour-pence; walks round it three times; and thrice repeats the Lord's\r\nPrayer. These ceremonies are never begun till after sun-set, in order\r\nto inspire the votaries with greater awe. If the afflicted be of the\r\nmale sex, like Socrates, he makes an offering of a cock to his\r\nAEsculapius, or rather to Tecla Hygeia; if of the fair sex, a hen. The\r\nfowl is carried in a basket, first round the well; after that into the\r\nchurch-yard; when the same orisons and the same circum-ambulations are\r\nperformed round the church. The votary then enters the church; gets\r\nunder the communion table; lies down with the Bible under his or her\r\nhead; is covered with the carpet or cloth, and rests there till break\r\nof day; departing after offering sixpence, and leaving the fowl in the\r\nchurch. If the bird dies, the cure is supposed to have been effected,\r\nand the disease transferred to the devoted victim.\"[37]\r\n\r\n\"At Withersden,\" says Hasted, \"is a well, which was once famous, being\r\ncalled St. Eustache's well, taking its name from Eustachius, Abbot of\r\nFlai, who is mentioned by Matt. Paris, An. 1200, to have been a man of\r\nlearning and sanctity, and to have come and preached at Wye, and to\r\nhave blessed a fountain there, so that afterwards its waters were\r\nendowed by such miraculous power, that by it all diseases were\r\ncured.\"[38] Unfortunately, wells do not always benefit the bathers.\r\nLilly[39] relates that in 1635 Sir George Peckham died in St.\r\nWinifred's Well, \"having continued so long mumbling his pater nosters\r\nand Sancta Winifreda ora pro me, that the cold struck into his body,\r\nand after his coming forth of that well he never spoke more.\"\r\n\r\nThe people of the Highlands of Scotland regarded fountains with\r\nparticular veneration. According to the Statistical Account of\r\nScotland, the minister of Kirkmichael, Banffshire, said: \"The sick who\r\nresort to them for health, address their vows to the presiding powers,\r\nand offer presents to conciliate their favor. These presents generally\r\nconsist of a small piece of money, or a few fragrant flowers. The same\r\nreverence in ancient times seems to have been entertained by every\r\npeople in Europe.\" Near Kirkmichael there was a fountain dedicated to\r\nSt. Michael, and once celebrated for its cures. \"Many a patient have\r\nits waters restored to health, and many more have attested the\r\nefficacy of their virtues. But, as the presiding power is sometimes\r\ncapricious, and apt to desert his charge, it now lies neglected,\r\nchoked with weeds, unhonored and unfrequented.\"[40]\r\n\r\nThe most noted well in Perthshire is in Trinity Gask. Again from the\r\nStatistical Account we quote: \"Superstition, aided by the interested\r\nartifices of Popish Priests, raised, in times of ignorance and\r\nbigotry, this well to no small degree of celebrity. It was affirmed\r\nthat every person who was baptized with the water of this well would\r\nnever be seized with the plague. The extraordinary virtue of Trinity\r\nGask well has perished with the downfall of superstition.\"[41]\r\n\r\nPinkerton, in speaking of the river Fillan in Scotland, says: \"In this\r\nriver is a pool consecrated by the ancient superstition of the\r\ninhabitants of this country. The pool is formed by the eddying of the\r\nstream round a rock. Its waves were many years since consecrated by\r\nFillan, one of the saints who converted the ancient inhabitants of\r\nCaledonia from paganism to the belief of Christianity. It has ever\r\nsince been distinguished by his name, and esteemed of sovereign virtue\r\nin curing madness. About two hundred persons afflicted in this way are\r\nannually brought to try the benefits of its salutary influence. These\r\npatients are conducted by their friends, who first perform the\r\nceremony of passing with them thrice through a neighbouring cairn: on\r\nthis cairn they then deposit a simple offering of clothes, or perhaps\r\na small bunch of heath. More precious offerings used once to be\r\nbrought. The patient is then thrice immerged in the sacred pool. After\r\nthe immersion, he is bound hand and foot, and left for the night in a\r\nchapel which stands near. If the maniac is found loose in the morning,\r\ngood hopes are conceived of his full recovery. If he is still bound,\r\nhis cure remains doubtful. It sometimes happens that death relieves\r\nhim, during his confinement, from the troubles of life.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Macaulay,[42] speaking of a consecrated well in St. Kilda, called\r\nTobirnimbuadh, or the spring of diverse virtues, says that \"near the\r\nfountain stood an altar, on which the distressed votaries laid down\r\ntheir oblations. Before they could touch sacred water with any\r\nprospect of success, it was their constant practice to address the\r\ngenius of the place with supplication and prayer. No one approached\r\nhim with empty hands.... Shells and pebbles, rags of linen or stuffs\r\nworn out, pins, needles, or rusty nails were generally all the tribute\r\nthat was paid.\"\r\n\r\nCollinson[43] mentions a well in the parish Wembton, called St. John's\r\nWell, to which in 1464 \"an immense concourse of people resorted: and\r\n... many who had for years labored under various bodily diseases, and\r\nhad found no benefit from physick and physicians, were, by the use of\r\nthese waters (after paying their due offerings), restored to their\r\nprimitive health.\"\r\n\r\nBrome, in his _Travels_, 1700, observes: \"In Lothien, two miles from\r\nEdinburg southward, is a spring called St. Katherine's Well, flowing\r\ncontinually with a kind of black fatness, or oil, above the water,\r\nproceeding (as it is thought) from the parret coal, which is frequent\r\nin these parts; 'tis of a marvellous nature, for as the coal, whereof\r\nit proceeds, is very apt quickly to kindle into a flame, so is the\r\noil of a sudden operation to heal all scabs and tumors that trouble\r\nthe outward skin, and the head and hands are speedily healed by virtue\r\nof this oil, which retains a very sweet smell; and at Aberdeen is\r\nanother well very efficacious to dissolve the stone, to expel sand\r\nfrom the reins and bladder, being good for the collick and drunk in\r\nJuly and August, not inferiour, they report, to the Spaw in\r\nGermany.\"[44]\r\n\r\nGrose tells us of a well dedicated to St. Oswald, between the towns of\r\nAlton and Newton. The neighbors have the opinion that a sick person's\r\nshirt thrown into the well will prognosticate the outcome of the\r\ndisease; if it floats the sick one will recover, if it sinks he will\r\ndie. To reward the saint for the information, they tear a rag off the\r\nshirt and hang it on the briers near by; \"where,\" says the writer, \"I\r\nhave seen such numbers as might have made a fayre rheme in a\r\npaper-myll.\" Similar practices are related by other authors. Ireland\r\nformerly had a sanctified well in nearly every parish. They were\r\nmarked by rude crosses and surrounded by fragments of cloth left as\r\nmemorials. St. Ronague's Well, near Cork, was very popular at one\r\ntime. Near Carrick-on-Suir is the holy well of Tubber Quan, the waters\r\nof which are reputed to have performed many miraculous cures. The\r\nwell was dedicated to two patron saints, St. Quan and St. Brogawn.\r\nThese saints are supposed to exert a special influence the last three\r\nSundays in June. \"It is firmly believed,\" says Brand, \"that at this\r\nperiod the two saints appear in the well in the shape of two small\r\nfishes, of the trout kind; and if they do not so appear, that no cure\r\nwill take place. The penitents attending on these occasions ascend the\r\nhill barefoot, kneel by the stream and repeat a number of paters and\r\naves, then enter it, go through the stream three times, at a slow\r\npace, reciting their prayers. They then go on the gravel walk, and\r\ntraverse it round three times on their bare knees, often till the\r\nblood starts in the operation, repeat their prayers, then traverse\r\nthree times round a tree on their bare knees, but upon the grass.\r\nHaving performed these exercises they cut off locks of their hair and\r\ntie them on the branches of the tree as specifics against headache.\"\r\n\r\nAfter being three times admonished in a dream, a man washed in St.\r\nMadern's Well in Cornwall and was miraculously cured, so say Bishop\r\nHall and Father Francis. Ranulf Higden, in his _Polychronicon_,\r\nrelates the wonderful cures performed at the holy well at Basingwerk.\r\nThe red streaks in the stones surrounding it were symbols of the blood\r\nof St. Wenefride, martyred by Carodoc.\r\n\r\nThe Scotch considered certain wells to have healing properties in the\r\nmonth of May. In the Sessions Records (June 12, 1628) it is reported\r\nthat a number of persons were brought before the Kirk Sessions of\r\nFalkirk, accused of going to Christ's Well on the Sundays of May to\r\nseek their health, and the whole being found guilty were sentenced to\r\nrepent \"in linens\" three several sabbaths. \"In 1657 a number of\r\npersons were publicly rebuked for visiting the well at Airth. The\r\ncustom was to leave a piece of money and a napkin at the well, from\r\nwhich they took a can of water, and were not to speak a word either in\r\ngoing or returning, nor on any account to spill a drop of the water.\r\nNotwithstanding these proceedings, many are known to have lately\r\ntravelled many miles into the Highlands, there to obtain water for the\r\ncure of their sick cattle.\"[45]\r\n\r\nTo-day, probably the most efficacious waters are to be found at the\r\nsacred fountain at La Salette and at the holy spring at Lourdes.\r\n\r\nWe have another specific form of healing which should be noticed. It\r\nwas especially common in Eastern churches, and was found to some\r\nextent in the West. I refer to Incubation, or \"Temple-sleep.\" This\r\npractice came down through early civilizations and was an adopted\r\npractice among Christians. The patient went to some church well known\r\nfor its cures, which was provided with mattresses or low couches, and\r\nattended by priests and assistants. Devotions being finished he lay\r\ndown to sleep. Sometimes he slept immediately, at other times sleep\r\nmust be wooed by fast and vigil. At any rate, during the sleep he\r\ndreamed that the saint touched him, or prescribed some remedy, and in\r\nthe first case he awoke cured, and in the second the prescribed\r\nmedicine brought about the relief.\r\n\r\nSophronius, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, wrote about 640 as follows:\r\n\"Cyrus appeared to the sick man in the form of a monk, not in a dream,\r\nas he appears to many; but in a waking vision, just as he was and is\r\nrepresented. He told the patient to rise and to plunge into the warm\r\nwater. Zosimos said it was impossible for him to move, but when the\r\norder was repeated, he slid like a snake into the bath. When he got\r\ninto the water, he saw the saint at his side, but when he came out,\r\nthe vision had vanished.\" Beside the cure of this paralytic at the\r\nchurch of Cyrus and John, he mentions the cure of many other diseases\r\nby this method of incubation. Among them are dumbness, blindness,\r\nbarrenness, possession, scrofula, dyspepsia, a broken leg, deformities\r\nof limbs, lameness, gout, diseases of the eyes, cataract, ulcer, and\r\ndropsy.\r\n\r\nAmong the churches of Greece and southern Italy incubation is still\r\ncommon. The climate may have some effect in limiting the area of this\r\npractice. Miss M. Hamilton furnishes us with some modern examples. In\r\nspeaking of a new picture of St. George in the church at Arachova, she\r\nsays: \"It is a votive offering of a Russian, who came a paralytic to\r\nArachova in July, 1905. He spent several weeks praying and sleeping in\r\nthe church, and departed completely cured. The festival of St. George\r\nis held on April 23rd. They have three days of dancing and feasting,\r\nand at night all suppliants bring their rugs and sleep round the\r\nshrines in the church. Every year many of the sick are found to be\r\ncured when morning comes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Church of the Evangelestria, our Lady of the Annunciation, is\r\nvisited by about forty-five thousand pilgrims every year. It is\r\nsituated at Tenos, and Miss Hamilton tells us what she saw during her\r\nvisit there in 1906:\r\n\r\n  \"On the morning before Annunciation Day this year, the\r\n  pilgrims could be seen making their way to the church.\r\n  Among them were cripples, armless, and legless,\r\n  half-rolling up the street; blind people groping their\r\n  way along; men and women with deformities of every kind;\r\n  one or two showing the pallor of death on their faces\r\n  were being carried up on litters. These evidently were\r\n  coming to Tenos as a last resource, when doctors were of\r\n  no avail. Other pilgrims were ascending after their own\r\n  fashion, according to vows they had made. One woman\r\n  toiled laboriously along on her knees, kissing the\r\n  stones of the way, and clasping a silver Madonna and\r\n  Child. Last year her daughter had been seized with\r\n  epilepsy, and she vowed to carry in this way this\r\n  offering to the Madonna of Tenos if she would cure her\r\n  daughter. The girl recovered and the other now with\r\n  thankful heart was fulfilling her part of the bargain.\r\n\r\n  \"The eve of Annunciation Day is the time when the\r\n  Panagia is believed to descend among the sick and work\r\n  miraculous cures among them. Then all the patients are\r\n  gathered together in the crypt or in the upper church.\r\n  The Chapel of the Well is the popular place for\r\n  incubation. There is more chance for miraculous cure\r\n  there than in the church. The little crypt can\r\n  accommodate only a comparatively small number, but they\r\n  are packed together as tightly as possible. From the\r\n  entrance up to the altar, they lie in two lines of three\r\n  or four deep, with a passage down the middle large\r\n  enough for only one person. Down the narrow way two\r\n  streams of people press the whole evening. They worship\r\n  at the shrines along the wall, purchase holy earth from\r\n  the spot where the picture was discovered, drink at the\r\n  sacred well, and are blessed by the priest at the altar.\r\n  The cripples and the sick desiring healing have been\r\n  engaged all day in such acts of worship; they have\r\n  received bread and water from the priests in the upper\r\n  church, paid homage to the all-powerful picture, offered\r\n  their candles to the Madonna, and all the time sought to\r\n  endue themselves with her presence. Now at night, still\r\n  fixing their thoughts upon her, and permeated by this\r\n  spirit of worship, they settle down to sleep in order\r\n  that she may appear to them in a dream.\r\n\r\n  \"Disappointment, of course, awaits the vast majority,\r\n  but on the evening of the vigil all are filled with\r\n  hope. They know the precedents of former years, how such\r\n  things have happened to some unfortunate people among\r\n  the pilgrims every year. Usually eight or nine miracles\r\n  take place, and lists of them are published for\r\n  distribution....\r\n\r\n  \"The church records contain accounts of the miracles\r\n  which now amount to many hundreds. They are practically\r\n  all of the type I have described--cure during a vision\r\n  while incubation was being practised. For example, the\r\n  case of a man from Moldavia is on record. He had become\r\n  paralyzed during a night-watch, and the doctor could\r\n  effect no relief. He was taken to the Chapel of the\r\n  Well, and when asleep he thought he heard a voice\r\n  telling him to arise. He awoke, thought it was a dream,\r\n  and fell asleep again. A second time he heard a voice,\r\n  and saw a white-robed woman of great beauty entering the\r\n  church. In his fear he rose and walked about. His\r\n  recovery was so complete that he could walk in the\r\n  procession round the town the following day.\"[46]\r\n\r\nThe medicinal power imputed to the sainted relics and shrines would\r\nnaturally be considered very valuable. So it proved. Wealth flowed to\r\na conventual treasury or a cathedral chapter where were deposited\r\nfragments of the martyred dead endowed with miraculous puissance. When\r\nthe Frankish forces sacked Constantinople at the beginning of the\r\nthirteenth century, the principal object of their ferocious cruelties\r\nand vigilant searches was the acquisition of precious relics.\r\nConcerning these relics Fort gives the following account:\r\n\r\n  \"These relics, captured in Constantinople, were divided\r\n  by the troops under Marquis de Montfort, with the same\r\n  justice as prevailed in the division of other booty. In\r\n  this way the Venetians were enabled to enrich their\r\n  metropolis with a piece of the sainted cross, an arm of\r\n  St. George, part of the head of St. John the Baptist,\r\n  the entire skeleton of St. Luke, that of the prophet St.\r\n  Simeon, and a small bottle of Jesus Christ's blood. The\r\n  Greek capital from the remotest times appears to have\r\n  monopolized this traffic in sacred wares, claiming to\r\n  possess a fragment of the stone on which Jacob slept,\r\n  and the staff transformed into a serpent by Moses.\r\n\r\n  \"Here also were guarded the Holy Virgin's vestments, her\r\n  spindle, drops of her milk, the cradle in which the\r\n  Saviour had lain, a tooth from his adolescent jaw, a\r\n  hair of his beard, a particle of the bread used in the\r\n  Last Supper, and a portion of the royal purple worn by\r\n  him before Pilate. Naturally clerical adventurers among\r\n  the occidental Crusaders, pending the sacking of the\r\n  Byzantine city, sought out most zealously these valuable\r\n  remnants of pristine glory, and in obtaining them were\r\n  by no means scrupulous with menaces and violence. When\r\n  scattered through Western Europe, in the monasteries and\r\n  other religious places, their curative properties\r\n  increased the pilgrimages thither of the sick and\r\n  diseased.\"[47]\r\n\r\nHe further gives us more in detail[48] an idea of the continual\r\naccumulation of riches which were derived from the exposure of these\r\nrelics to the sick and infirm and the consequent growth in wealth of\r\nthe monasteries and cathedrals. The monastic system was probably most\r\nresponsible for the change from the simple adoration of the early\r\nChristians to the use of relics as a miraculous means of healing.\r\nThose which were transported with elaborate ceremonies, enclosed in a\r\nmagnificent stone sarcophagus, and covered by an edifice of imposing\r\nproportions were almost sure to bring to their custodians great\r\nwealth. It is said that when the body of St. Sebastian, which was\r\nlegitimately obtained from Rome, together with the purloined remains\r\nof St. Gregory, reached the cloister of Soissons, so great was the\r\ncrowd of invalids who were cured, and so generous were they in their\r\ndonations, that the monks actually counted eighty measures of money\r\nand one hundred pounds in coin. The great value of such objects may be\r\ncalculated when it is remembered that in the year 1056 securities\r\namounting to ten thousand solidi were pledged for the production of\r\nthe relics of St. Just and St. Pastor, consequent upon the legal\r\ndecision of ownership between Berenger, a French ruler, and a\r\nNarbonnese archbishop. The Reichberg annals provide a further example.\r\nThey state that the emperor demanded certain hostages, or the holy arm\r\nof St. George, as a suitable guarantee for the institution of a public\r\nmart in Germany.\r\n\r\nVenetian merchants were among the first to realize the commercial\r\nvalue of relics, and enjoyed a lucrative traffic in this holy\r\nmerchandise. It was not until the eleventh century, however, that the\r\ngovernment of Venice founded public marts or fairs for the commercial\r\nexchange of saintly relics, although Rome and Pavia had long conducted\r\nsuch enterprises. These fairs were placed under the tutelary\r\nprotection of some patron saint, the Venetians, of course, thus\r\nhonoring St. Mark. They were not always particular how these relics\r\nwere procured, for it is stated that when negotiations for the\r\nexchange of a well-preserved body of St. Tairise proved unsuccessful,\r\nbecause the Greek monks who possessed it refused absolutely to sell or\r\nbarter, these enterprising traders quietly stole the desired skeleton.\r\n\r\nRelics provided a suitable method of acquiring ecclesiastical fortunes\r\nfor denuded cloisters or impoverished nunneries; and if the old relics\r\nlost their power it was not difficult to procure episcopal assurance\r\nof the miraculous powers of new ones. For the procuring of special\r\nfunds the venerated objects were taken from place to place, under\r\npriestly surveillance, presented to the sick and infirm with assurance\r\nof relief, and with the demand for large sums of money.\r\n\r\nWe can easily understand, then, why such donations were regarded as\r\nmost precious presents, and chronicled in the conventual records as\r\nevents of high importance. As early as the ninth century, documentary\r\nevidence of authenticity frequently accompanied a gift of relics, and\r\nfurnished legal proof of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe gift of St. Peter's knife to a German monastery by a benevolent\r\nabbot was deemed a most illustrious act. About the same time a noble\r\npilgrim succeeded, after great importunity and a lavish outlay of\r\nmoney, in obtaining trifling particles of the relics of Abraham,\r\nIsaac, and Jacob, which he enclosed in a priceless box and donated to\r\nthe monastery of St. Gall. This gift was considered the greatest event\r\nof the year, but when it is considered that this and similar presents\r\ninsure in the community, where they are deposited uninterrupted peace,\r\nunstinted plenty, absence of catastrophies, and the cure of diseases,\r\ntheir value is explained.\r\n\r\nThe commercial aspect of ecclesiastical cures, however, was discovered\r\nby other than priestly or monkish eyes, and different forms began to\r\nbe presented. Of these White says: \"Very important among these was the\r\nAgnus Dei, or piece of wax from the Paschal candles, stamped with the\r\nfigure of a lamb and consecrated by the Pope. In 1471 Pope Paul II\r\nexpatiated to the Church on the efficacy of this fetich in preserving\r\nmen from fire, shipwreck, tempest, lightning, and hail, as well as in\r\nassisting women in childbirth; and he reserved to himself and his\r\nsuccessors the manufacture of it. Even as late as 1517 Pope Leo X\r\nissued, for a consideration, tickets bearing a cross and the\r\nfollowing inscription: 'This cross measured forty times makes the\r\nheight of Christ in his humanity. He who kisses it is preserved for\r\nseven days from falling-sickness, apoplexy, and sudden death.'\"[49]\r\n\r\nThe enormous revenues procured through the means of relics, and the\r\nlack of certain means of identifying them, would naturally encourage\r\nthe imposition of fraud. The crime would not appear so great after one\r\nexperience, for the perpetrators could readily see that it really made\r\nno difference so far as efficacy in the cure of diseases was\r\nconcerned, whether or not the relics were genuine. The history of some\r\nof the relics unfortunately proves them not to be relics at all, or at\r\nleast not to be the relics which the faithful supposed them to be.\r\nNotice a few instances. In a magnificent shrine in the cathedral at\r\nCologne are the skulls of the three kings, or wise men from the East,\r\nwho brought gifts to the infant Lord. They have rested here since the\r\ntwelfth century and have been the source of enormous wealth and power\r\nto the cathedral chapter. Not to be outdone by the cathedral, for the\r\nchurch of St. Gereon a cemetery has been depopulated, and the bones\r\nthus procured have been placed upon the walls and are known as the\r\nrelics of St. Gereon and his Theband band of martyrs! Further\r\ncompetition arose in the neighboring church of St. Ursula. Another\r\ncemetery was despoiled and the bones covering the interior of the\r\nwalls are known as the relics of St. Ursula and her eleven thousand\r\nvirgin martyrs. Anatomists now declare that many of the bones are\r\nthose of men, but this made no more difference in their healing\r\nefficacy in the Middle Ages than the fact that the relics of St.\r\nRosalia at Palermo, famed for their healing power, have lately been\r\ndeclared by Professor Buckland, the eminent osteologist, to be the\r\nbones of a goat.\r\n\r\nTwo different investigations have been conducted by the French courts\r\nconcerning the fountain of La Salette, and in both cases the miracles\r\nwhich make the shrine famous were pronounced to be fraudulent. The\r\nrecent restoration of the cathedral at Trondhjem has revealed a tube\r\nin the walls, not unlike the apparatus discovered in the Temple of\r\nIsis at Pompeii; the healing power of this sacred spring was augmented\r\nby angelic voices which issued from the supposedly solid walls.[50]\r\n\r\nWhile the golden age of the therapeutic use of relics was from the\r\nsixth to the sixteenth centuries, modern times, with its physicians,\r\nhospitals, and drugs, has not been deprived of this method of cure.\r\nMackay, writing in the latter half of the past century, touches this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nAt Port Royal, in Paris, is kept with great care a thorn, which the\r\npriests of that seminary assert to be one of the identical thorns\r\nthat bound the holy head of the Son of God. How it came there, and by\r\nwhom it was preserved, has never been explained. This is the famous\r\nthorn which the long dissensions of the Jansenists and the Molenists\r\nhave made celebrated, and which worked the miraculous cure upon\r\nMademoiselle Perier, an account of which is so interesting that I give\r\nit. The cure occurred on March 14, 1646.\r\n\r\n  \"A young pensioner in the monastery, by name Margaret\r\n  Perier, who for three years and a half had suffered from\r\n  a lachrymal fistula, came up in her turn to kiss it; and\r\n  the nun, her mistress, more horrified than ever at the\r\n  swelling and deformity of her eye, had a sudden impulse\r\n  to touch the sore with the relic, believing that God was\r\n  sufficiently able and willing to heal her. She thought\r\n  no more of the matter, but the little girl having\r\n  retired to her room, perceived a quarter of an hour\r\n  after that her disease was cured; and when she told her\r\n  companions, it was indeed found that nothing more was to\r\n  be seen of it. There was no more tumor; and her eye,\r\n  which the swelling (continuous for three years) had\r\n  weakened and caused to water, had become as dry, as\r\n  healthy, as lively as the other. The spring of the\r\n  filthy matter, which every quarter of an hour ran down\r\n  from nose, eye, and mouth, and at the very moment before\r\n  the miracle had fallen upon her cheek (as she declared\r\n  in her deposition), was found to be quite dried up; the\r\n  bone, which had been rotted and putrified, was restored\r\n  to its former condition; all the stench, proceeding from\r\n  it, which had been so insupportable that by order of the\r\n  physicians and surgeons she was separated from her\r\n  companions, was changed into a breath as sweet as an\r\n  infant's; and she recovered at the same moment her sense\r\n  of smell....\r\n\r\n  \"Mons. Felix, Chief Surgeon to the King, who had seen\r\n  her during the month of April, was curious enough to\r\n  return on the 8th of August, and having found the cure\r\n  as thorough and marvellous as it had seemed to him at\r\n  the time, declared under his hand that 'he was obliged\r\n  to confess that God alone had the power to produce an\r\n  effect so sudden and extraordinary.'\"[51]\r\n\r\nMackay gives the following account of the distribution of relics about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century: \"Europe still swarms with these\r\nreligious relics. There is hardly a Roman Catholic Church in Spain,\r\nPortugal, France, or Belgium, without one or more of them. Even the\r\npoorly endowed churches of the villages boast the possession of\r\nmiraculous thighbones of the innumerable saints of the Romish\r\ncalendar. Aix-la-Chapelle is proud of the veritable _chasse_, or\r\nthighbone of Charlemagne, which cures lameness. Halle has a thighbone\r\nof the Virgin Mary; Spain has seven or eight, all said to be undoubted\r\nrelics. Brussels at one time preserved, and perhaps does now, the\r\nteeth of St. Gudule. The faithful who suffered from the toothache, had\r\nonly to pray, look at them, and be cured.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThe miracles performed at the tomb of the Deacon Paris in the cemetery\r\nof St. Medard are of comparatively recent occurrence, and well\r\nattested. For example, we have the case of \"la demoiselle Coirin,\"\r\nwhich, to say the least, is out of the ordinary. \"In 1716,\" says\r\nDearmer, \"this lady, then aged thirty-one, fell from her horse;\r\nparalysis and an ulcer followed; by 1719 the ulcer was in a horrible\r\ncondition; in 1720 her mother refused an operation preferring to let\r\nher die in peace. In 1731--after fifteen years of an open breast--she\r\nasked a woman to say a novena at the tomb of Francois de Paris, to\r\ntouch the tomb with her shift, and to bring back some earth. This was\r\ndone on August 10th; on the 11th she put on the shift and at once felt\r\nimproved; on the 12th she touched the wound with the earth and it at\r\nonce began to heal. By the end of August the skin was completely\r\nhealed up, and on September 24th she went out of doors.\"[53]\r\n\r\nAmong the most noted relics at the present time are the Holy Coat of\r\nTreves,[54] the Winding-sheet of Christ at Besancon, and the Santa\r\nScala at Rome. The last are said to be the steps which Jesus ascended\r\nand descended when he was brought before Pontius Pilate, and are held\r\nin great veneration. It is sacrilegious to walk upon them; the knees\r\nof the faithful alone must touch them, and that only after they have\r\nreverently kissed them. Cures are still performed by all these relics.\r\n\r\nThe two shrines at present best known and which have proved most\r\nefficacious are those of Lourdes in France[55] and St. Anne de Beaupre\r\nin the province of Quebec. Lourdes owes its reputed healing power to a\r\nbelief in a vision of the Virgin received there during the last\r\ncentury. Over 300,000 persons visit there every year, and no small\r\nproportion of them return with health restored as a reward for their\r\nfaith. At Lourdes and many other shrines bathing forms a part of the\r\nceremony, and on account of the unsanitary conditions in the former\r\nplace, there is some danger that the French Government will cause its\r\nabandonment. Charcot, who established the Salpetriere hospital where\r\nhypnotism was so successfully used, sent fifty or sixty patients to\r\nLourdes every year. He was firmly convinced of the healing power of\r\nfaith. One commendable feature of the management at Lourdes is the\r\nopportunity given for investigation; in fact, this is courted. Most of\r\nthe sick bring medical details of their diseases; an examining\r\ncommittee of medical men examine them after they arrive there and\r\nafter the cure. About two hundred and fifty doctors visit there every\r\nyear, and the widest opportunity is given to them for examination of\r\nthe cases, regardless of their nationality or religious belief or\r\nscepticism. This attitude might well be assumed by these in control of\r\nother shrines or of healing cults.\r\n\r\nIn America thousands flock to the shrine of St. Anne de Beaupre\r\nannually. Here are to be found bones, supposed to be the wrist bones\r\nof the holy mother of the Virgin, and many sufferers are able to\r\ntestify to their value in the healing of various diseases.\r\n\r\nOn all parts of the Continent there are shrines of more or less renown\r\nas healing centres. In Normandy the springs of Fecamp or Grand-Andely\r\nare much frequented; in Austria, at Mariazell, Styria, the church is\r\nvisited by two hundred thousand pilgrims a year, and has been a centre\r\nof healing since 1157; in Italy, the church of S. Maria dell' Arco,\r\nnear Naples, has been a local Lourdes for four hundred years, and\r\nhere, as at Amalfi, Palermo, and other places, the ancient practice of\r\nincubation is still prevalent. The adherents of the Eastern Church\r\nalso have their shrines, and among the visitors to the shrines of\r\nGreece, many pilgrims are rewarded for their faith by being healed.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to remark the avidity manifested in all ages, and in all\r\ncountries, to obtain possession of some relic of any person who had\r\nbeen much spoken of, if for nothing more than for his crimes.[56]\r\nSnuff-boxes made from Shakespeare's mulberry-tree, twigs from\r\nNapoleon's willow, or bullets from the field of Waterloo have all been\r\nmuch sought after. Souvenirs of everything and anything are still much\r\nin demand. It is within the last decade that a foreign war-ship\r\nanchored in New York harbor, and after the officers courteously opened\r\nthe ship for the inspection of visitors they found that even their\r\nsilver toilet articles and plate had been carried away by the relic\r\nmaniacs. A United States admiral, rather more facetiously than\r\npatriotically, remarked that \"the American people of to-day would\r\nsteal anything but a cellarful of water.\" I suppose the remark, so far\r\nas it applies to the relic-crazed crowd, would be as applicable to any\r\nother people of any other time.\r\n\r\nWe have a right to ask, in closing this chapter, how it was possible\r\nfor men to believe in the power of relics to cure diseases. The\r\npractice seems to have developed from the reasoning that the saints\r\nwho helped men while in the imperfections of the flesh, could be of\r\neven more benefit when they were with God in the perfections of the\r\nspiritual life. St. Augustine (426), for example, speaks of comparing\r\nthe wonders performed by pagan \"deities with our dead men,\" and that\r\nthe miracles wrought by idols \"are in no way comparable to the\r\nwonders wrought by our martyrs.\" Some might agree with this, and yet\r\nfind no warrant for using relics. There was, however, the remembrance\r\nof the dead man who was restored to life by contact with the bones of\r\nElisha, and of the handkerchiefs and aprons which touched Paul's body\r\nand were thereby filled with healing efficacy. Even to-day we do not\r\nfail to recognize the value of the association of places and objects,\r\nand one finds it difficult to enter Westminster Abbey, for instance,\r\nwithout feeling a thrill on account of the sacred clay reposing there.\r\nWhen we remember the beginning of the use of relics in the catacombs\r\nwe can better understand the development of the practice.\r\n\r\n[21] G.

All the world knows there is no virtue in\r\n  charms, &c., but a strong conceit and opinion alone, as\r\n  Pomponatius holds, which forceth a motion of the\r\n  humours, spirits, and blood, which takes away the cause\r\n  of the malady from the parts affected. The like we may\r\n  say of the magical effects, superstitious cures, and\r\n  such as are done by montebanks and wizards. As by wicked\r\n  incredulity many are hurt (so saith Wierus), we find, in\r\n  our experience, by the same means, many are relieved.\"\r\n\r\nIn discussing the subject of healers one must keep in mind the fact\r\nthat the healers of the first millennium of our era were almost wholly\r\nexorcists, on account of the prevailing theory, and even after that\r\ntime exorcism, on the one hand, and the faith in relics and shrines on\r\nthe other, formed the principal means of cure. It is therefore\r\ndifficult to differentiate the other healers from the exorcists, and\r\nto decide whether certain cures were performed by healers or by\r\nrelics.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty confronts us. Many authentic cures have probably\r\nbeen wrought by saints, but unfortunately most of those performed by\r\nthem have little contemporary evidence to support them, but rest on\r\nthe very shaky testimony of tradition. White,[57] in a keen analysis,\r\nshows how the legends of miraculous cures have grown around great\r\nbenefactors of humanity, taking Francis Xavier as a pertinent example.\r\n\r\nWe must also remember, however, that what are called miracles formed\r\npart of the evidence which led to the canonization of a saint, and a\r\nlarge number of healing miracles was usually included in the list. The\r\nprocedure of the court connected with the canonization was conducted\r\nwith the greatest rigor. Sitting as examiners were learned and upright\r\nmen from all nations, and the witness must be irreproachable as far as\r\ncharacter was concerned. The two witnesses required for each miracle\r\nmust testify concerning the nature of the disease and the cure, and\r\nsign the deposition after it had been read to them. Following that,\r\nthe examiners sifted the evidence in a hypercritical way and\r\nemphasized the weak places. Benedict XIV justly said: \"The degree of\r\nproof required is the same as that required for a criminal case, since\r\nthe cause of religion and piety is that of the commonweal.\" Some\r\nconsideration must be thus given to this testimony, but the value of\r\nit depends on the number of years elapsing after the cures were\r\nperformed and the direct connection of the witnesses with the cure in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nThe craving for the miraculous in bodily cures prejudiced many\r\nhistorians, especially when the desire to emphasize the importance of\r\nthe church was uppermost in the minds of the writers. We can consider,\r\nthough, the material at hand, always recognizing that marvellous cures\r\ncan be performed when the authority of the physician has all the\r\nweight of an infallible church behind it and the patient is credulous.\r\nWe must notice in this connection that the healers up to the time of\r\nthe magnetizers depended on religious ceremonies for their efficiency,\r\nwith the exception of those who endorsed and propagated \"sympathetic\r\ncures.\"\r\n\r\nAs we well know, the first healing among Christians was done by Jesus\r\nhimself and the apostles; after this for two centuries the exorcists\r\nperformed most of the cures. We have accounts of one non-Christian\r\nhealer whose cures have probably been handed down to us on account of\r\nhis exalted position. Tacitus and Suetonius describe how Vespasian\r\n(9-79) healed in at least two cases. The first was a blind man well\r\nknown in Alexandria. In the second case the historians disagree; one\r\nsays it was a leg and the other a hand which was diseased and cured.\r\nAccording to the story, the god Serapis revealed to the patients that\r\nthey would be cured by the emperor. Tacitus says that Vespasian did\r\nnot believe in his own power and it was only after much persuasion\r\nthat he was induced to try the experiment.[58]\r\n\r\nThe Christians, however, were not to be outdone as healers. Irenaeus\r\n(130-202) gives a long list of infirmities which were cured by the\r\nrepresentatives of the church, and in writing, about the year 180,\r\ndraws a comparison between them and the heretics. \"For they [the\r\nheretics] can neither confer sight on the blind nor hearing on the\r\ndeaf, nor chase away all sorts of demons (except those which are sent\r\ninto others by themselves--if they can ever do as much as this): nor\r\ncan they cure the weak, or the lame, or the paralytic; or those who\r\nare distressed in any other part of the body, as has often been done\r\nin regard to bodily infirmity. Nor can they furnish effective remedies\r\nfor those external accidents which may occur. And so far are they from\r\nbeing able to raise the dead, as the Lord raised them (and the\r\nApostles did by means of prayer, as has been frequently done in the\r\nbrotherhood on account of some necessity--the entire church in that\r\nparticular locality entreating with much fasting and prayer, the\r\nspirit of the dead man has returned, and he has been bestowed in\r\nanswer to the prayers of the saints--) that they do not even believe\r\nthat this could possibly be done.\" He further says: \"Others again heal\r\nthe sick by laying their hands upon them, and they are made whole.\r\nYea, moreover, as I have said, the dead even have been raised up, and\r\nremained among us for many years.\"\r\n\r\nThe great Origen (185-254), writing when he would be certain to have\r\nhis words most severely criticised, says, after referring to the\r\nmiracles of the apostles: \"And there are still preserved among\r\nChristians traces of that Holy Spirit which appeared in the form of a\r\ndove. They expel evil spirits, and perform many cures, and foresee\r\ncertain events, according to the will of the Logos.\" In another of his\r\nworks we find the following: \"For they [the Jews] have no longer\r\nprophets or miracles, traces of which to a considerable extent are\r\nstill found among Christians, and some of them more remarkable than\r\never have existed among the Jews; and these we ourselves have\r\nwitnessed.\"\r\n\r\nAs has already been seen, different methods were used by various\r\nhealers, and we must not omit a brief account of healing by unction.\r\nThe very definite instructions laid down in the Epistle of James were\r\nevidently strictly carried out in the early church, but the first\r\ndefinite mention of anointing after that made by Mark and James is\r\nfound in the writings of Tertullian (160-220). He speaks of the pagan\r\nemperor Severus being graciously mindful of Christians: \"For he sought\r\nout the Christian Proculus, surnamed Torpacion, the steward of\r\nEuhodias, and in gratitude for his having once cured him by\r\nanointing, he kept him in his palace till the day of his death.\"[59]\r\n\r\nIf the Christians anointed pagans it is legitimate to suppose that\r\nthey also anointed fellow-Christians, and that if this was performed\r\nwithout special mention about the end of the second century, it must\r\nhave been common from the time of James to that period. It is probable\r\nthat during the first seven centuries of our era the practice of\r\npraying with the sick and anointing them with oil never ceased. There\r\nmay be some objection to our considering the subject of anointing with\r\noil as purely mental healing, but according to the instructions given\r\nfor its use there was scarcely enough oil employed to be of benefit\r\notherwise, and especially as food. Mental healing, then, is the\r\nrationale of the cures.\r\n\r\nPuller[60] gives us three of the earliest incidents of healing by\r\nunction, the original accounts all being written by contemporaries and\r\nfriends. Some time between the years 335 and 355, St. Parthenius,\r\nBishop of Lampsacus, anointed a man who was described as \"altogether\r\nwithered.\" The account says: \"Then getting up, he gently and gradually\r\nsoftened the man's body with the holy oil, and straightway made him to\r\nrise up healed.\" Refinus, a well-known writer and an eye-witness to\r\nthis healing, tells of St. Macarius of Alexandria and four monks\r\nrestoring, about the year 375, \"a man, withered in all his limbs and\r\nespecially in his feet.\" He says: \"But when he had been anointed all\r\nover by them with oil in the Name of the Lord, immediately the soles\r\nof his feet were strengthened. And when they said to him, 'In the name\r\nof Jesus Christ ... arise, and stand on thy feet, and return to thy\r\nhouse,' immediately arising and leaping, he blessed God.\" Some years\r\nlater, Palladius, the friend of St. Chrysostom, writes of another of\r\nSt. Macarius's cures which he witnessed: \"But at the time that we were\r\nthere, there was brought to him from Thessalonica a noble and wealthy\r\nvirgin, who during many years had been suffering from paralysis. And\r\nwhen she had been presented to him, and had been thrown down before\r\nthe cell of the blessed man, he, being moved with compassion for her,\r\nwith his own hands anointed her during twenty days with holy oil,\r\npouring out prayers for her to the Lord, and so sent her back cured to\r\nher own city.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sacramentary of Serapion, Bishop of Thmuis, Egypt, written about\r\n350, provides for the consecration of bread and water, as well as oil,\r\nfor healing; and in a prayer concerning oil and water there contained,\r\nthe following words are used: \"Grant healing power upon these\r\ncreatures, that every fever and every demon and every sickness may\r\ndepart through the drinking and the anointing, and that the partaking\r\nof these creatures may be a healing medicine and a medicine of\r\ncomplete soundness in the Name of the Only begotten, Jesus Christ,\"\r\netc. The Apostolic Constitutions of about 375 contain a prayer of\r\nconsecration used over oil and water brought by members of the\r\ncongregation, as follows: \"Do thou now sanctify this water and this\r\noil, through Christ, in the name of him that offered or of her that\r\noffered, and give to these things a power of producing health and of\r\ndriving away diseases, of putting to flight demons, of dispersing\r\nevery snare through Christ our Hope,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAbout 390, St. Jerome wrote a life of St. Hilarion (291-371) in which\r\nthe latter is thus set forth as a healer: \"But lo! that parched and\r\nsandy district, after the rain had fallen, unexpectedly produced such\r\nvast numbers of serpents and poisonous animals that many, who were\r\nbitten, would have died at once if they had not run to Hilarion. He\r\ntherefore blessed some oil, with which all the husbandmen and\r\nshepherds touched their wounds and found an infallible cure.\"\r\n\r\nOil was not always employed for anointing, but might be drunk by the\r\nsick, and this use of it was made in healing a girl, by St. Martin of\r\nTours, about 395. St. Germain, Bishop of Auxerre (418-448), when the\r\nphysicians were powerless during a plague, blessed some oil and\r\nanointed the swollen jaws of those who were sick, whereupon they\r\nrecovered; and St. Genevieve of Paris, who died about 502, used to\r\nheal the sick with oil.\r\n\r\nIn Bede's biography of St. Cuthbert we find an instance of this saint\r\nhealing a girl about the year 687. A young woman was troubled for a\r\nwhole year with an intolerable pain in her head and side which the\r\nphysicians were unable to relieve. Cuthbert \"in pity anointed the\r\nwretched woman with oil. From that time she began to get better, and\r\nwas well in a few days.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighth century the anointing of the sick began\r\nto decline, largely on account of the changed attitude of the church.\r\nAt this time this ceremony began to be used for spiritual ills rather\r\nthan for bodily diseases. Before long, anointing was monopolized by\r\nthe church for spiritual advantage, and is still so used by the Roman\r\nCatholic Church in the ceremony of Extreme Unction.\r\n\r\nIn returning to the more direct methods of healing, we find that St.\r\nGregory of Nazianzus (329-390) confirmed the reports of the marvellous\r\ncures wrought by the martyrs, Cosmo and Damian, who were beheaded in\r\n303. During the life of Gregory of Tours (538-594), the healing\r\nefficacy of the saints' relics was rivalled by the miraculous aid\r\nrendered to the sick by St. Julian. The solitude of the holy anchorite\r\nwas interrupted by the persistent and despairing clamor of the sick to\r\nwhom he gave health. The great Turonese pontiff also tells us that\r\none day Aredius, traversing Paris, found Chilperic prostrate with a\r\ngrievous fever. The royal sufferer sought the saint's prayers as an\r\nirresistible curative.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of a Teutonic nobleman was brought to St. Gall (556-640)\r\nseriously ill with an incurable disorder, presenting the livid\r\nappearance of an animated cadaver. The saint approached the\r\nunconscious invalid as she reclined on her mother's knee, and assuming\r\nthe bended attitude of invocation by her side, made a fervent prayer\r\nand evoked the demon producing the sickness to instantly depart. The\r\neffort was all that was desired. Shortly after this, about the year\r\n648, St. Vardrille, the founder of Fontanelle, exercised his remedial\r\npotency in healing the palsied arm of a forester whose indiscreet zeal\r\nhad induced him to transfix the sainted abbot with a lance.\r\n\r\nWe have rather a strange case from the beginning of the seventh\r\ncentury, where the moral and mental element seems to have been strong.\r\nAbbe Eustasius returning from Rome, whither a mission of Clothair II\r\nhad called him, was urgently summoned by the sorrowful parent of a\r\nBurgundian maiden, in the last agonies of a frightful malady, to\r\nappear and cure the moribund daughter. On answering the call he found\r\nthat the child had in her youth been consecrated by the vows of\r\nchastity, and on account of this shrunk from a marriage sanctioned by\r\nher parents. Eustasius reproached the father for his efforts to\r\nviolate the solemn obligations of the virgin, and upon obtaining a\r\nformal renunciation of further attempts to coerce her into matrimony,\r\nthe saint, by personal intercession, obtained a complete cure.\r\n\r\nIt was found that certain remedies in the hands of certain saints were\r\nefficacious, but they did not have the same power if administered by\r\nothers. For instance, Franciscus de Paula succored an anchylosed joint\r\nby the energetic surgery of three dried figs which he gave the\r\nsuffering patient to eat. Similarly, a maiden grieving under a\r\ncancerous disease which surgical skill had frankly admitted was\r\nincurable, was restored to robust vigor by the administering of some\r\nmild herbs. This savored rather too much of medicine, and other holy\r\nhealers used more orthodox means. Hugo the Holy abstracted a serpent\r\nfrom the infirm body of a woman by the use of holy water, and Coleta,\r\nthe saintess, awakened from the dreamless slumber of death more than\r\none hundred slain infants by the efficacy of a cross.\r\n\r\nEven such a serious disorder as leprosy was said to have been healed\r\nby saintly care. St. Martin, who gave special attention to sufferers\r\nwith this disease, cured a leper by kissing him, we are told. Toward\r\nthe middle of the sixth century, St. Radegonde displayed her faith by\r\nfirst washing the repulsive sores and afterward applying her pure lips\r\nto them. On one occasion an insolent leper asserted that unless his\r\nputrefying limbs were kissed by this candidate for canonical honors he\r\ncould not be cured.[61]\r\n\r\nBede (673-735), the great English historian, in his careful way tells\r\nus of cures performed by St. John of Beverly during the first part of\r\nthe eighth century. According to this record, St. John cured a dumb\r\nyouth, who had never spoken a word, by the sign of the cross on his\r\ntongue, and he afterward had \"ready utterance.\" He used holy water on\r\na woman so that, like Peter's wife's mother, she arose and ministered\r\nto them, healed a friend who was injured by being thrown from a horse,\r\ncured a nun of a grievous complaint, and restored a servant, an\r\naccount of which I shall give in Bede's words:\r\n\r\n  \"The bishop went in and saw him in a dying condition,\r\n  and the coffin by his side, whilst all present were in\r\n  tears. He said a prayer, blessed him, and on going out,\r\n  as is the usual expression of comforters, said, 'May you\r\n  soon recover.' Afterwards when they were sitting at\r\n  table, the lad sent to his lord, to desire he would let\r\n  him have a cup of wine, because he was thirsty. The\r\n  earl, rejoicing that he could drink, sent him a cup of\r\n  wine, blessed by the bishop; which, as soon as he had\r\n  drunk, he immediately got up, and shaking off his late\r\n  infirmity, dressed himself, and going in to the bishop,\r\n  saluted him and the other guests, saying, 'He would also\r\n  eat and be merry with them.' They ordered him to sit\r\n  down with them at the entertainment, rejoicing at his\r\n  recovery. He sat down, ate and drank merrily, and\r\n  behaved himself like the rest of the company; and living\r\n  many years after, continued in the same state of\r\n  health.\"[62]\r\n\r\nSkipping a few centuries, we find that Bernard of Clairvaux\r\n(1091-1153), the most prominent figure of the twelfth century,\r\nperformed an abundance of cures, as his biographers testify. \"The\r\ncures were so many that the witnesses themselves were unable to detail\r\nthem all. At Doningen, near Rheinfeld, where the first Sunday of\r\nAdvent was spent, Bernard cured, in one day, nine blind persons, ten\r\nwho were deaf or dumb, and eighteen lame or paralytic. On the\r\nfollowing Wednesday, at Schaffhausen, the number of miracles\r\nincreased.\"[63] Concerning these cures Morison says: \"Thirty-six\r\nmiraculous cures in one day would seem to have been the largest\r\nstretch of supernatural power which Bernard permitted to himself. The\r\nhalt, the blind, the deaf, and the dumb were brought from all parts to\r\nbe touched by Bernard. The patient was presented to him, whereupon he\r\nmade the sign of the cross over the part affected, and the cure was\r\nperfect.\"[64]\r\n\r\nThe following case in which details are more fully given is of much\r\ninterest: \"At Toulouse, in the church of St. Saturninus, in which we\r\nwere lodged, was a certain regular canon, named John. John had kept\r\nhis bed for seven months, and was so reduced that his death was\r\nexpected daily. His legs were so shrunken that they were scarcely\r\nlarger than a child's arms. He was quite unable to rise to satisfy the\r\nwants of nature. At last his brother canons refused to tolerate his\r\npresence any longer among them, and thrust him out into the\r\nneighbouring village. When the poor creature heard of Bernard's\r\nproximity, he implored to be taken to him. Six men, therefore,\r\ncarrying him as he lay in bed, brought him into a room close to that\r\nin which he was lodged. The abbot heard him confess his sins, and\r\nlistened to his entreaties to be restored to health. Bernard mentally\r\nprayed to God: 'Behold, O Lord, they seek for a sign, and our words\r\navail nothing, unless they be confirmed with signs following.' He then\r\nblessed him and left the chamber, and so did we all. In that very hour\r\nthe sick man arose from his couch, and running after Bernard, kissed\r\nhis feet with a devotion which cannot be imagined by any one who did\r\nnot see it. One of the canons, meeting him, nearly fainted with\r\nfright, thinking he saw his ghost.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Francis of Assisi (1182-1226), the great founder of the Franciscan\r\nOrder, was not less famed for his miracles of healing than for his\r\nChrist-like life and his stigmata. Among those cured were epileptics,\r\nparalytics, and the blind. A typical case of cure by this humble saint\r\nis given to show his method and its results: \"Once when Francis the\r\nSaint of God was making a long circuit through various regions to\r\npreach the gospel of God's kingdom he came to a city called\r\nToscanella. Here ... he was entertained by a knight of that same city\r\nwhose only son was a cripple and weak in all his body. Though the\r\nchild was of tender years he had passed the age of weaning; but he\r\nstill remained in a cradle. The boy's father, seeing the man of God to\r\nbe endued with such holiness, humbly fell at his feet and besought him\r\nto heal his son. Francis, deeming himself to be unprofitable and\r\nunworthy of such power and grace, for a long time refused to do it. At\r\nlast, conquered by the urgency of the knight's entreaties, after\r\noffering up prayer, he laid his hand on the boy, blessed him, and\r\nlifted him up. And in the sight of all, the boy straightway arose\r\nwhole in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and began to walk hither\r\nand thither about the house.\"[65]\r\n\r\nSt. Thomas of Hereford (1222-1282) was the last Englishman to be\r\nofficially canonized. The extant documents of his canonization record\r\nno less than four hundred and twenty-nine miracles alleged to have\r\nbeen performed by him. The following case of resurrection from the\r\ndead occurred, however, twenty-one years after his death. I quote the\r\naccount in full:\r\n\r\n  \"On the 6th of September, 1303, Roger, aged two years\r\n  and three months, the son of Gervase, one of the warders\r\n  of Conway Castle, managed to crawl out of bed in the\r\n  night and tumble off a bridge, a distance of\r\n  twenty-eight feet; he was not discovered till the next\r\n  morning, when his mother found him half naked and quite\r\n  dead upon a hard stone at the bottom of the ditch, where\r\n  there was no water or earth, but simply the rock, which\r\n  had been quarried to build the castle. Simon Waterford,\r\n  the vicar, who had christened the child, John de Bois,\r\n  John Guffe, all sworn witnesses, took their oaths on the\r\n  Gospel that they saw and handled the child dead. The\r\n  King's Crowners (Stephen Ganny and William Nottingham)\r\n  were presently called and went down into the moat. They\r\n  found the child's body cold and stiff, and white with\r\n  hoar-frost, stark dead, indeed. While the Crowners, as\r\n  their office requires, began to write what they had\r\n  seen, one John Syward, a near neighbour, came down and\r\n  gently handled the child's body all over, and finding it\r\n  as dead as ever any, made the sign of the cross upon its\r\n  forehead, and earnestly prayed after this manner:\r\n  'Blessed St. Thomas Cantelope, you by whom God has\r\n  wrought innumerable miracles, show mercy unto this\r\n  little infant, and obtain he may return to life again.\r\n  If this grace be granted he shall visit your holy\r\n  sepulchre and render humble thanks to God and you for\r\n  the favor.' No sooner had Syward spoken these words,\r\n  than the child began to move his head and right arm a\r\n  little, and forthwith life and vigor came back again\r\n  into every part of his body. The Crowners, and many\r\n  others who were standing by, saw the miracle, and in\r\n  that very place, with great admiration, returned humble\r\n  thanks to God and St. Thomas for what they had seen. The\r\n  mother, now overjoyed, took the child in her arms, and\r\n  went that day to hear mass in a church not far off,\r\n  where, upon her knees, she recognized with a grateful\r\n  heart that she owed the life of her infant to God and\r\n  St. Thomas. Her devotion ended, she returned home, and\r\n  the child, feeling no pain at all, walked as he was wont\r\n  to do up and down the house, though a little scar still\r\n  continued in one cheek, which after a few days, quite\r\n  vanished away.\"[66]\r\n\r\nSt. Catharine of Siena (1347-1380) obtained considerable reputation as\r\na healer, principally, however, in the line of exorcism; this, though,\r\nmeant the cure of any disease. Like St. Paul, she was one of a large\r\nnumber of saints who healed others but did not cure herself; she died\r\nat the age of thirty-three. A woman was presented to the immaculate\r\nsaintess for prompt remedy; by the virtue of divine magic a demon was\r\nforced from each part of her body where he had taken refuge, but\r\nresisting absolute ejectment from this carnal abode, made a desperate\r\nconflict in the throat, where by uninterrupted scratches he reproduced\r\nhimself in the form of an abscess.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion the saint was more successful. Laurentia, a maiden\r\nof youthful years, placed by her father within the sheltering walls of\r\na cloister, to assume ultimately monastic vows, was quickly captured\r\nby an errant demon. As an irrefutable demonstration of the impure\r\norigin of her infirmity, an annalist asserts, this spirit promptly\r\nanswered in elegant Latinity all questions propounded; but the\r\nstrongest confirmation of this belief was the miraculous ability which\r\nenabled her to disclose the most secret thoughts of others, and\r\ndivulge the mysterious affairs of her associates. St. Catharine at\r\nlength liberated the suffering female from her diabolical tenant. More\r\nextraordinary claims are made for her. It is said that she stayed a\r\nplague at Varazze, and healed a throng at Pisa.[67]\r\n\r\nRaimondo da Capua, her faithful friend and constant companion, wrote\r\nher biography and gives us different instances of remarkable cures\r\nperformed by her. For example, he tells us that Father Matthew of\r\nCenni, the director of the Hospital of la Misericordia, was stricken\r\nwhen the plague was raging in Siena in 1373, and of his marvellous\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we had better allow him to tell of Catharine's power in his\r\nown words:\r\n\r\n  \"One day on entering, I saw some of the brothers carrying Father\r\n  Matthew like a corpse from the chapel to his room; his face was\r\n  livid, and his strength was so far gone that he could not answer me\r\n  when I spoke to him. 'Last night,' the brothers said, 'about seven\r\n  o'clock, while ministering to a dying person, he perceived himself\r\n  stricken, and fell at once into extreme weakness.' I helped to put\r\n  him on his bed; ... he spoke afterwards, and said that he felt as if\r\n  his head was separated into four parts. I sent for Dr. Senso, his\r\n  physician; Dr. Senso declared to me that my friend had the plague,\r\n  and  that every symptom announced the approach of death. 'I fear,'\r\n  he said, 'that the House of Mercy (Misericordia) is about to be\r\n  deprived of its good director.' I asked if medical art could not\r\n  save him. 'We shall see,' replied Senso, 'but I have only a very\r\n  faint hope; his blood is too much poisoned.' I withdrew, praying God\r\n  to save the life of this good man. Catharine, however, had heard of\r\n  the illness of Father Matthew, whom she loved sincerely, and she\r\n  lost no time in repairing to him. The moment she entered the room,\r\n  she cried, with a cheerful voice, 'Get up, Father Matthew, get up!\r\n  This is not a time to be lying idly in bed.' Father Matthew roused\r\n  himself, sat up on his bed, and finally stood on his feet. Catharine\r\n  retired; and the moment she was leaving the house, I entered it, and\r\n  ignorant of what had happened, and believing my friend to be still\r\n  at the point of death, my grief urged me to say, 'Will you allow a\r\n  person so dear to us, and so useful to others, to die?' She appeared\r\n  annoyed at my words, and replied, 'In what terms do you address me?\r\n  Am I like God, to deliver a man from death?' But I, beside myself\r\n  with sorrow, pleaded, 'Speak in that way to others if you will, but\r\n  not to me; for I know your secrets; and I know you obtain from God\r\n  whatever you ask in faith.' Then Catharine bowed her head, and\r\n  smiled just a little; after a few minutes she lifted up her head and\r\n  looked at me full in the face, her countenance radiant with joy, and\r\n  said, 'Well, let us take courage; he will not die this time,' and\r\n  she passed on. At these words I banished all fear, for I understood\r\n  that she had obtained some favor from heaven. I went straight to my\r\n  sick friend, whom I found sitting on the side of his bed. 'Do you\r\n  know,' he cried, 'what she has done for me?' He then stood up and\r\n  narrated joyfully what I have here written. To make the matter more\r\n  sure, the table was laid, and Father Matthew seated himself at it\r\n  with us; they served him with vegetables and other light food, and\r\n  he, who an hour before could not open his mouth, ate with us,\r\n  chatting and laughing gaily.\"\r\n\r\nNone of Catharine's biographers fail to relate wonderful instances of\r\nher healing power.[68]\r\n\r\nMartin Luther (1483-1546), the great leader of the Reformation, and\r\nSt. Francis Xavier (1506-1552), the leader of the Counter-Reformation,\r\nwere both healers, so it is said. Luther's cure of his friend and\r\nhelper, Melanchthon, by prayer for and encouragement of the patient,\r\nis well known. Xavier's miracles were legion, but have been somewhat\r\ndiscredited by a recent author.[69] I add but one example. \"A certain\r\nTome Paninguem, a fencing-master, says, I knew Antonio de Miranda, who\r\nwas a servant of the Father Francis, and assisted him when saying\r\nMass. He told me that when going one night on business to Combature,\r\nhe was bitten by a venomous serpent. He immediately fell down as\r\nthough paralyzed and became speechless. He was found thus lying\r\nunconscious. Informed of the fact, Father Francis ordered Antonio to\r\nbe carried to him: and when he was laid down speechless and senseless,\r\nthe Father prayed with all those present. The prayer finished, he put\r\na little saliva with his finger on the bitten place on Antonio's foot,\r\nand at the same moment, Antonio recovered his senses, his memory and\r\nhis speech, and felt himself healed. I have since heard details of\r\nthis occurrence from the mouths of several eye-witnesses.\"[70]\r\n\r\nIf we accept Goerres's account,[71] the most remarkable instance of\r\ncurative power possessed by a saint is that afforded by St. Sauveur of\r\nHorta (1520-1567). Outside of this one work I have been unable to find\r\nany reference to this saint, so I will give a sketch of his apparently\r\nremarkable life. He was born in Catalonia, and received the first part\r\nof his name from a presentiment of his sponsors that he was to be a\r\nsavior of men, and the second part because he entered the monastery at\r\nHorta. A short time after he finished his novitiate, people in some\r\nway got the idea that he had a wonderful gift of healing, and soon\r\npatients came to him in crowds from all parts of the country. He\r\ncontinued healing for several years. At one time during the feast of\r\nthe Annunciation he cured six thousand persons, and at another time he\r\nfound ten thousand patients, from viceroy to laborer, waiting for him\r\nat Valencia before the convent of St. Marie de Jesus. Notwithstanding\r\nhis apparently great success, his brother monks complained to the\r\nbishop concerning the dirt and disorder caused by the crowds, and\r\nafter a reprimand he was sent at midnight to the monastery at Reus,\r\nwhere he was known as Alphonse and assigned to the kitchen. In spite\r\nof this, crowds continued to come and he was transferred from\r\nmonastery to monastery, but always with the same result--the crowd\r\nsought him to be healed. He was known as simple, open, and obedient in\r\nhis relations with men, and austere toward himself. He was patient and\r\nresigned, compassionate toward the poor and sick, and full of zeal for\r\ntheir conversion. The number of patients he is said to have cured is\r\nincredible, and it is even said that he resuscitated three dead\r\npersons. After his death miracles were performed at his tomb. Why he\r\nwas not in favor with his superiors and his brother monks is unknown;\r\nhis friends say they were jealous; his enemies, that his cures were\r\nnot genuine.\r\n\r\nSt. Philip Neri (1551-1595), the founder of the Oratorians, was\r\nrenowned as a healer. He cured Clement VIII of gout by touching and\r\nprayer, a woman of cancer of the breast by the mere touch and\r\nassurance, a man of grievous symptoms such as loss of speech and\r\ninternal pain by simply laying on of hands, and many similar and\r\nequally serious cases. The following case was counted nearly equal to\r\na resurrection: \"In 1560 Pietro Vittrici of Parma, being in the\r\nservice of Cardinal Boncompagni, afterward Pope Gregory XIII, fell\r\ndangerously ill. He was given up by the physicians, and was supposed\r\nto be as good as dead. In this extremity he was visited by Philip who,\r\nas soon as he entered the sick man's room, began, as was his wont, to\r\npray for him. He then put his hand on Pietro's forehead, and at the\r\ntouch he instantly revived. In two days' time he was out of the house\r\nperfectly well and strong and went about telling people how he had\r\nbeen cured by Father Philip.\"[72]\r\n\r\nGeorge Fox (1624-1691), the founder of the Quakers, performed some\r\nsimple cures of which he himself tells us. The most famous case was\r\nthat of the cure of a lame arm by command, the account of which we\r\ntake from his pen. He thus records it: \"After some time I went to the\r\nmeeting at Arnside where Richard Meyer was. Now he had been long lame\r\nof one of his arms; and I was moved by the Lord to say unto him, among\r\nall the people, 'Prophet Meyer stand up upon thy legs' (for he was\r\nsitting down) and he stood up and stretched out his arm that had been\r\nlame a long time, and said: 'Be it known unto all you people that this\r\nday I am healed.' But his parents could hardly believe it, but after\r\nthe meeting was done, had him aside and took off his doublet; and then\r\nthey saw it was true. He soon after came to Swarthmore meeting, and\r\nthere declared how the Lord had healed him. But after this the Lord\r\ncommanded him to go to York with a message from him; and he disobeyed\r\nthe Lord; and the Lord struck him again, so that he died about\r\nthree-quarters of a year after.\"[73] The cure evidently was not\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nValentine Greatrakes (1628-1683) was born in Affane, Ireland. He was\r\nthe son of an Irish gentleman, had a good education, and was a\r\nProtestant. In 1641, at the outbreak of the Irish rebellion, he fled\r\nto England, and from 1649-1656 he served under Cromwell. In 1661,\r\nafter a period of melancholy derangement, he believed that God had\r\ngiven him power of curing \"king's evil\" by touching or stroking and\r\nprayer. After some success with this disease, he added to his list\r\nague, epilepsy, convulsions, paralysis, deafness, ulcers, aches, and\r\nlameness, and for a number of years he devoted three days in every\r\nweek, from 6 A. M. to 6 P. M., to the exercise of his healing gifts.\r\nThe crowds which thronged around him were so great that the\r\nneighboring towns were not able to accommodate them. He thereupon left\r\nhis house in the country and went to Youghal, where sick people, not\r\nonly from all parts of Ireland but from England, continued to\r\ncongregate in such great numbers that the magistrates were afraid they\r\nwould infect the place with their diseases.\r\n\r\nIn some instances he exorcised demons; in fact, he claimed that all\r\ndiseases were caused by evil spirits, and every infirmity was, with\r\nhim, a case of diabolic possession. The church endeavored to prohibit\r\nhis operations but without avail. He was invited to London, and,\r\nnotwithstanding that an exhibition before the nobility failed,\r\nthousands flocked to his house in Lincoln's Inn Fields. In the\r\n\"Miscellanies\" of St. Evremond a graphic sketch is given of his work.\r\nThe results of his healing are there summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"So great was the confidence in him, that the blind\r\n  fancied they saw the light which they did not see--the\r\n  deaf imagined that they heard--the lame that they\r\n  walked straight, and the paralytic that they had\r\n  recovered the use of their limbs. An idea of health\r\n  made the sick forget for a while their maladies; and\r\n  imagination, which was not less active in those merely\r\n  drawn by curiosity than in the sick, gave a false view\r\n  to the one class, from the desire of seeing, as it\r\n  operated a false cure on the other from the strong\r\n  desire of being healed. Such was the power of the\r\n  Irishman over the mind, and such was the influence of\r\n  the mind over the body. Nothing was spoken of in London\r\n  but his prodigies; and these prodigies were supported\r\n  by such great authorities that the bewildered multitude\r\n  believed them almost without examination, while more\r\n  enlightened people did not dare to reject them from\r\n  their own knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThat there were real cures, however, seems most probable. The Bishop\r\nof Dromore testifies thus from his own observation: \"I have seen pains\r\nstrangely fly before his hands till he had chased them out of the\r\nbody; dimness cleared, and deafness cured by his touch. Twenty persons\r\nat several times, in fits of the falling sickness, were in two or\r\nthree minutes brought to themselves.... Running sores of the 'King's\r\nevil' were dried up; grievous sores of many months' date in a few days\r\nhealed, cancerous knots dissolved, etc.\" [74]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Flamstead, the astronomer, when a lad of nineteen,\r\nwent into Ireland to be touched by Greatrakes, and he testifies that\r\nhe was an eyewitness of several cures, although he himself was not\r\nbenefited. In a letter to Lord Conway, Greatrakes says: \"The King's\r\ndoctors, this day (for the confirmation of their majesties' belief),\r\nsent three out of the hospital to me, who came on crutches; but,\r\nblessed be God! they all went home well, to the admiration of all\r\npeople, as well as the doctors.\"[75]\r\n\r\nSeveral pamphlets were issued by medical men and others criticising\r\nhis work, and in 1666 he published a vindication of himself entitled\r\n\"A Brief Account.\" This contained numerous testimonials by Bishop\r\nWilkins, Bishop Patrick, Dr. Cudworth, Dr. Whichcote, and others of\r\ndistinction and intelligence. After the retirement of Greatrakes, John\r\nLeverett, a gardener, succeeded to the \"manual exercise,\" and declared\r\nthat after touching thirty or forty a day, he felt so much goodness go\r\nout of him that he was fatigued as if he had been digging eight roods\r\nof ground.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Greatrakes was working among the people of\r\nLondon, an Italian enthusiast, named Francisco Bagnone, was operating\r\nin Italy with equal success. He had only to touch the sick with his\r\nhands, or sometimes with a relic, to accomplish cures which astonished\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nHardly less famous than Greatrakes was Johann Jacob Gassner\r\n(1727-1779). He was born at Bratz, near Bludenz, and became Roman\r\nCatholic priest at Kloesterle. He believed that most diseases were\r\ncaused by evil spirits which could be exorcised by conjuration and\r\nprayer. He began practising and soon attracted attention. In 1774 he\r\nreceived a call from the bishop at Ratisbon to Ellwangen, where by the\r\nmere word of command, \"Cesset\" (Give over), he cured the lame and\r\nblind, but especially those who were afflicted with epilepsy and\r\nconvulsions, and who were thereby supposed to be obsessed. His cures\r\nwere not permanent in some cases, and before he died he lost power and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [57] A. D.

This may be more or less true as far as they are used\r\nto-day, but in the days when these terms meant something in real life\r\nthere was a distinction. The talisman was probably at first an\r\nastronomical figure, but later the term became more comprehensive.\r\nPope portrays this astrological import in his couplet,\r\n\r\n  \"Of talismans and sigils knew the power,\r\n   And carefully watch'd the planetary hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe amulet was always carried about the person, while the other two\r\nmight be in the possession of the person in the case of the talisman,\r\nor, in the case of the charm, if a material object it could be placed\r\nentirely outside of one's care. The talisman and amulet must be a\r\ncompound of some substance, the charm might be a gesture, a look, or a\r\nspoken word. Notice the example of charms according to Tennyson's\r\nwords,\r\n\r\n  \"Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm\r\n   Of woven paces and of waving hands.\"\r\n\r\nThey were all used for defensive purposes, _i. e._, to keep away evil,\r\nin the form of demons, disease, or misfortune, but they might,\r\nespecially the talisman, also attract good. Their power was of a\r\nmagical character, and was exercised in a supernatural manner.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the talisman probably originated from the belief that\r\ncertain properties or virtues were impressed upon substances by\r\nplanetary influences. \"A talisman,\" says Pettigrew, \"may in general\r\nterms be defined to be a substance composed of certain cabalistic\r\ncharacters engraved on stone, metal, or other material, or else\r\nwritten on slips of paper.\" Hyde quotes a Persian writer who defines\r\nthe Telesm or Talismay as \"a piece of art compounded of the celestial\r\npowers and elementary bodies, appropriated to certain figures or\r\npositions, and purposes and times, contrary to the usual manner.\"\r\n\r\nWe are told by Maimonides that images or idols were called Tzelamim on\r\naccount of the power or influence which was supposed to reside in\r\nthem, rather than on account of their particular figure or form.\r\nTownley has opined that the reason for the production of astrological\r\nor talismanic images was probably the desire of early peoples to have\r\nsome representation of the planets during their absence from sight, so\r\nthat they might at all times be able to worship the planetary body\r\nitself or its representative. To accomplish this purpose, the\r\nastrologers chose certain colors, metals, stones, trees, etc., to\r\nrepresent certain planets, and constructed the talismans when the\r\nplanets were in their exaltation and in a happy conjunction with other\r\nheavenly bodies. In addition to this, incantations were used in an\r\nendeavor to inspire the talisman with the power and influence of the\r\nplanet for which it stood.\r\n\r\nPettigrew says: \"The Hebrew word for talisman (magan) signifies a\r\npaper or other material, drawn or engraved with the letters composing\r\nthe sacred name Jehovah, or with other characters, and improperly\r\napplied to astrological representations, because, like the letters\r\ncomposing 'The Incomparable Name,' they were supposed to serve as a\r\ndefence against sickness, lightning, and tempest. It was a common\r\npractice with magicians, whenever a plague or other great calamity\r\ninfested a country, to make a supposed image of the destroyer, either\r\nin gold, silver, clay, wax, etc., under a certain configuration of the\r\nheavens, and to set it up in some particular place that the evil might\r\nbe stayed.\"[76]\r\n\r\nThe Jewish phylacteries must therefore be considered talismans and not\r\namulets. The writings contained in them are portions of the law and\r\nare prepared in a prescribed manner. Three different kinds are used:\r\none for the head, another for the arm, and the third is attached to\r\nthe door-posts. The following is a Hebrew talisman supposed to have\r\nconsiderable power: \"It overflowed--he did cast darts--Shadai is all\r\nsufficient--his hand is strong, and is the preserver of my life in all\r\nits variations.\"[77]\r\n\r\nArnot gives an account of some Scottish talismans not unlike the\r\nphylacteries of the Jews, which were for use on the door-posts. \"On\r\nthe old houses still existing in Edinburgh,\" he says, \"there are\r\nremains of talismanic or cabalistical characters, which the\r\nsuperstitious of earlier days had caused to be engraven on their\r\nfronts. These were generally composed of some text of Scripture, of\r\nthe name of God, or, perhaps, of an emblematic representation of the\r\nresurrection.\"[78]\r\n\r\nThe connection of astrology, or, as he calls it, \"astronomy,\" and the\r\ntalisman with medicine is well portrayed by Chaucer in his picture of\r\na good physician of his day. He says:\r\n\r\n \"With us there was a doctor of phisike;\r\n  In al the world, was thar non hym lyk\r\n  To speke of physik and of surgerye,\r\n  For he wos groundit in astronomie.\r\n  He kept his pacient a ful gret del\r\n  In hourys by his magyk naturel;\r\n  Wel couth he fortunen the ascendent\r\n  Of his ymagys for his pacient.\"\r\n\r\nFosbrooke has divided talismans into five classes, examples of some of\r\nwhich I have already given. They are: \"1. The _astronomical_, with\r\ncelestial signs and intelligible characters. 2. The _magical_, with\r\nextraordinary figures, superstitious words, and names of unknown\r\nangels. 3. The _mixed_, of celestial signs and barbarous words, but\r\nnot superstitious, or with names of angels. 4. The _sigilla\r\nplanetarum_, composed of Hebrew numeral letters, used by astrologers\r\nand fortune-tellers. 5. _Hebrew names and characters_. These were\r\nformed according to the cabalistic art.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of signatures bears a close resemblance to talismans,\r\nand some believe that talismans have largely grown out of this\r\ndoctrine. Dr. Paris[79] defines the doctrine as the belief that \"every\r\nnatural substance which possesses any medical virtues indicates, by an\r\nobvious and well-marked external character, the disease for which it\r\nis a remedy or the object for which it should be employed.\" Southey\r\nsays,[80] \"The signatures [were] the books out of which the ancients\r\nfirst learned the virtues of herbs--Nature having stamped on divers of\r\nthem legible characters to discover their uses.\" Some opined that the\r\nexternal marks were impressed by planetary influences, hence their\r\nconnection with talismans; others simply reasoned it out that the\r\nAlmighty must have placed a sign on the various means which he had\r\nprovided for curing diseases.\r\n\r\nColor and shape were the two principal factors in interpreting the\r\nsignatures. White was regarded as cold and red as hot, hence cold and\r\nhot qualities were attributed to different medicines of these colors\r\nrespectively. Serious errors in practice resulted from this opinion.\r\nRed flowers were given for disorders of the sanguiferous system; the\r\npetals of the red rose, especially, bear the \"signature\" of the blood,\r\nand blood-root, on account of its red juice, was much prescribed for\r\nthe blood. Celandine, having yellow juice, the yellow drug, turmeric,\r\nthe roots of rhubarb, the flowers of saffron, and other yellow\r\nsubstances were given in jaundice; red flannel, looking like blood,\r\ncures blood taints, and therefore rheumatism, even to this day,\r\nalthough many do not know why _red_ flannel is so efficacious.\r\n\r\nLungwort, whose leaves bear a fancied resemblance to the surface of\r\nthe lungs, was considered good for pulmonary complaints, and\r\nliverwort, having a leaf like the liver, cured liver diseases.\r\nEye-bright was a famous application for eye diseases, because its\r\nflowers somewhat resemble the pupil of the eye; bugloss, resembling a\r\nsnake's head, was valuable for snake bite; and the peony, when in bud,\r\nbeing something like a man's head, was \"very available against the\r\nfalling sickness.\" Walnuts were considered to be the perfect signature\r\nof the head, the shell represented the bony skull, the irregularities\r\nof the kernel the convolutions of the two hemispheres of the brain,\r\nand the husk the scalp. The husk was therefore used for scalp\r\nwounds, the inner peel for disorders of the meninges, and the\r\nkernel was beneficial for the brain and tended to resist poisons.\r\nLilies-of-the-valley were used for the cure of apoplexy, the signature\r\nreasoning being, as Coles says, \"for as that disease is caused by the\r\ndrooping of humors into the principal ventrices of the brain, so the\r\nflowers of this lily, hanging on the plants as if they were drops, are\r\nof wonderful use herein.\"\r\n\r\nCapillary herbs naturally announced themselves as good for diseases\r\nof the hair, and bear's grease, being taken from an animal thickly\r\ncovered with hair, was recommended for the prevention of baldness.\r\nNettle-tea is still a country remedy for nettle rash; prickly plants\r\nlike thistles and holly were prescribed for pleurisy and stitch in\r\nthe side, and the scales of the pine were used in toothache, because\r\nthey resemble front teeth. \"Kidney-beans,\" says Berdoe, \"ought to have\r\nbeen useful for kidney diseases, but seem to have been overlooked\r\nexcept as articles of diet.\" Poppy-heads were used \"with success\" to\r\nrelieve diseases of the head, and the root of the \"mandrake,\" from its\r\nsupposed resemblance to the human form, was a very ancient remedy for\r\nbarrenness and was evidently so esteemed by Rachel, in the account\r\ngiven in Genesis 30:14 ff.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of small-pox red bed coverings were employed in\r\norder to bring the pustules to the surface of the body. The patient\r\nmust be indued with red; the bed furniture and hangings should be red\r\nand red substances were to be looked upon by the patient; burnt\r\npurple, pomegranate seeds, mulberries or other red ingredients were\r\ndissolved in their drink. John of Gladdesden, physician to Edward II,\r\nprescribed the following treatment as soon as the eruption appeared:\r\n\"Cause the whole body of your patient to be wrapped in scarlet cloth,\r\nor any other red cloth, and command everything about the bed to be\r\nmade red.\" He further says that \"when the son of the renowned King of\r\nEngland (Edward II) lay sick of the small-pox I took care that\r\neverything around the bed should be of a red color; which succeeded so\r\ncompletely that the Prince was restored to perfect health, without a\r\nvestige of a pustule remaining.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Francis I, when infected with smallpox, was rolled up in a\r\nscarlet cloth, by order of his physicians, as late as 1765;\r\nnotwithstanding this treatment he died. Kampfer says that \"when any of\r\nthe Japanese emperor's children are attacked with the small-pox, not\r\nonly the chamber and bed are covered with red hangings, but all\r\npersons who approach the sick prince must be clad in scarlet gowns.\"\r\nBy a course of reasoning similar to that used in the treatment of\r\nsmall-pox, it was supposed that flannel dyed nine times in blue was\r\nefficacious in removing glandular swellings.[81]\r\n\r\nThe astrological factor in talismans was most important because it\r\nwas considered that certain stars and planets in certain relations\r\nproduced certain diseases and contagious disorders. Astrologers, for\r\nexample, attributed the plague to a conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter\r\nin Sagittarius, on the tenth of October, or to a conjunction of Saturn\r\nand Mars in the same constellation, on the twelfth of November. Burton\r\nmakes the most generous melancholy, as that of Augustus, to come from\r\nthe conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Libra; the bad, as that of\r\nCatiline, from the meeting of Saturn and the moon in Scorpio. If these\r\ndisorders were produced by planets it was reasonable to suppose that\r\nthey could be cured by planets.\r\n\r\nThe virtue of herbs depended upon the planet under which they were\r\nsown or gathered. For example, verbena or vervain should be gathered\r\nat the rising of the dog-star, when neither the sun nor the moon\r\nshone, but an expiatory sacrifice of fruit and honey should previously\r\nhave been offered to the earth. If this was carried out it had power\r\nto render the possessor invulnerable, to cure fevers, to eradicate\r\npoison, and to conciliate friendship. Notice also, that black\r\nhellebore, to be effective, was to be plucked not cut, and this with\r\nthe right hand, which was then to be covered with a portion of the\r\nrobe and secretly to be conveyed to the left hand. The person\r\ngathering it was to be clad in white, to be barefooted, and to offer a\r\nsacrifice of bread and wine.\r\n\r\nNot only the planets and the stars, but the moon has had a potent\r\ninfluence on medicine. For instance, mistletoe was to be cut with a\r\ngolden knife, and when the moon was only six days old. Brand[82]\r\nquotes from _The Husbandman's Practice, or Prognostication Forever_,\r\npublished in 1664, the following curious passage, \"Good to purge with\r\nelectuaries, the moon in Cancer; with pills, the moon in Pisces; with\r\npotions, the moon in Virgo; good to take vomits, the moon being in\r\nTaurus, Virgo, or the latter part of Sagittarius; to purge the head by\r\nsneezing, the moon being in Cancer, Leo, or Virgo; to stop fluxes and\r\nrheumes, the moon being in Taurus, Virgo, or Capricorne; to bathe when\r\nthe moon is in Cancer, Libra, Aquarius, or Pisces; to cut the hair off\r\nthe head or beard when the moon is in Libra, Sagittarius, Aquarius, or\r\nPisces.\"\r\n\r\nThe Loseley manuscripts provide us with further examples. \"Here\r\nbegyneth ye waxingge of ye mone, and declareth in dyvers tymes to let\r\nblode, whiche be gode. In the furste begynynge of the mone it is\r\nprofetable to yche man to be letten blode; ye ix of the mone, neyther\r\nbe nyght ne by day, it is not good.\" They also tell of a physician\r\nnamed Simon Trippe, who wrote to a patient in excuse for not visiting\r\nhim, as follows: \"As for my comming to you upon Wensday next, verely\r\nmy promise be past to and old pacient of mine, a very good\r\ngentlewoman, one Mrs. Clerk, wch now lieth in great extremity. I\r\ncannot possibly be with you till Thursday. On Fryday and Saterday the\r\nsigne wilbe in the heart; on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, in the\r\nstomake; during wch time it wilbe no good dealing with your ordinary\r\nphysicke untill Wensday come sevenight at the nearest, and from that\r\ntime forwards for 15 or 16 days passing good.\"[83]\r\n\r\nNot unlike this is an incident of the year 686, given by Bede, where\r\n\"a holy Bishop having been asked to bless a sick maiden, asked 'when\r\nshe had been bled?' and being told that it was on the fourth day of\r\nthe moon, said: 'You did very indiscreetly and unskilfully to bleed\r\nher on the fourth day of the moon; for I remember that Archbishop\r\nTheodore, of blessed memory, said that bleeding at that time was very\r\ndangerous, when the light of the moon and the tide of the ocean is\r\nincreasing; and what can I do to the girl if she is like to die?'\"[84]\r\n\r\n\"So great, indeed,\" says Fort, \"became the abuse of medical astrology,\r\nwhether by the direct juxtaposition of stellar influence, or through\r\napposite images, that a celebrated Church Council at Paris declared\r\nthat images of metal, wax, or other materials fabricated under certain\r\nconstellations or according to fixed characters--figures of peculiar\r\nform, either baptized, consecrated, or exorcised, or rather desecrated\r\nby the performance of formal rites at stated periods which it was\r\nasserted, thus composed, possessed miraculous virtues set forth in\r\nsuperstitious writings--were placed under the ban and interdicted as\r\nerrors of faith.\"[85]\r\n\r\nWe shall see that magnetism developed from astrology, and some other\r\nforms of mental healing from magnetism. One of these, sympathetic\r\ncures, was talismanic in its character, and therefore I give a brief\r\naccount of its method of working, in this place.\r\n\r\nSympathetic cures probably started with Paracelsus, although Von\r\nHelmont tells us that the secret was first put forth by Ericcius\r\nWohyus, of Eburo. As a development from magnetism the former\r\noriginated the \"weapon salve\" which excited so much attention about\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century. The following was a receipt\r\ngiven by him for the cure of any wound inflicted by a sharp weapon,\r\nexcept such as had penetrated the heart, the brain, or the arteries.\r\n\"Take the moss growing on the head of a thief who has been hanged and\r\nleft in the air; of real mummy; of human blood, still warm--of each,\r\none ounce; of human suet, two ounces; of linseed oil, turpentine, and\r\nArmenian bole--of each, two drachms. Mix all well in a mortar, and\r\nkeep the salve in an oblong, narrow urn.\" With the salve the weapon\r\n(not the wound), after being dipped in blood from the wound, was to be\r\ncarefully anointed, and then laid by in a cool place. In the meantime,\r\nthe wound was washed with fair, clean water, covered with a clean soft\r\nlinen rag, and opened once a day to cleanse off purulent matter. A\r\nwriter in the _Foreign Quarterly Review_ says there can be no doubt\r\nabout the success of the treatment, \"for surgeons at this moment\r\nfollow exactly the same method, _except_ anointing the weapon!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR KENELM DIGBY]\r\n\r\nThe weapon-salve continued to be much spoken of on the Continent, and\r\nDr. Fludd, or A Fluctibus, the Rosicrucian, introduced it into\r\nEngland. He tried it with great success in several cases, but in the\r\nmidst of his success an attack was made upon him and his favorite\r\nremedy, which, however, did little or nothing to diminish the belief\r\nin its efficacy. One \"Parson Foster\" wrote a pamphlet entitled\r\n\"Hyplocrisma Spongus; or a Spunge to wipe away the Weapon-salve,\" in\r\nwhich he declared that it was as bad as witchcraft to use or recommend\r\nsuch an unguent; that it was invented by the devil, who, at the last\r\nday, would seize upon every person who had given it the least\r\nencouragement. \"In fact,\" said Parson Foster, \"the Devil himself gave\r\nit to Paracelsus; Paracelsus to the emperor; the emperor to the\r\ncourtier; the courtier to Baptista Porta; and Baptista Porta to Dr.\r\nFludd, a doctor of physic, yet living and practising in the famous\r\ncity of London, who now stands tooth and nail for it.\" Dr. Fludd, thus\r\nassailed, took up his pen and defended the unguent in a caustic\r\npamphlet.\r\n\r\nThe salve changed into a powder in the hands of Sir Kenelm Digby, the\r\nson of Sir Edward Digby who was executed for his participation in the\r\nGunpowder Plot. Sir Kenelm was an accomplished scholar and an able\r\nman, but at the same time a most extravagant defender of the powder of\r\nsympathy for the healing of wounds. This powder came into sudden and\r\npublic notoriety through an accident to a distinguished person. Mr.\r\nJames Howell, the well-known author of the Dendrologia, in endeavoring\r\nto part two friends in a duel, received a severe cut on the hand.\r\nAlarmed by the accident, one of the combatants bound up the cut with\r\nhis garter and conveyed him home. The king sent his own surgeon to\r\nattend Mr. Howell, but in four or five days the wound was not\r\nrecovering very rapidly and he made application to Sir Kenelm. The\r\nlatter first inquired whether he possessed anything that had the blood\r\nupon it, upon which Mr. Howell produced the garter with which his hand\r\nhad been bound. A basin of water in which some powder of vitriol had\r\nbeen dissolved was procured, and the garter immediately immersed in\r\nit, whereupon, to quote Sir Kenelm, Mr. Howell said, \"I know not what\r\nails me, but I find that I feel no more pain. Methinks that a pleasing\r\nkind of freshness, as it were a wet cold napkin, did spread over my\r\nhand, which hath taken away the inflammation that tormented me\r\nbefore.\" He was then advised to lay away all plasters and keep the\r\nwound clean and in a moderate temperature.\r\n\r\nTo prove conclusively the efficacy of the powder of sympathy, after\r\ndinner the garter was taken out of the basin and placed to dry before\r\nthe fire. No sooner was this done than Mr. Howell's servant came\r\nrunning to Sir Kenelm saying that his master's hand was again\r\ninflamed, and that it was as bad as before. The garter was again\r\nplaced in the liquid and before the return of the servant all was well\r\nand easy again. In the course of five or six days the wound was\r\ncicatrized and a cure performed.\r\n\r\nThis case excited considerable attention at court, and on inquiry Sir\r\nKenelm told the king that he learned the secret from a much-travelled\r\nCarmelite friar who became possessed of it while journeying in the\r\nEast. Sir Kenelm communicated it to Dr. Mayerne, the king's physician,\r\nand from him it was known to even the country barbers. Even King\r\nJames, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Buckingham, and many other\r\nnoble personages believed in its efficacy.\r\n\r\nIt would be a waste of time, had we space, to present fully Sir\r\nKenelm's profound and lengthy explanation of the cure. He tried to\r\nmake the cure more reasonable and acceptable by bringing forth certain\r\nalleged phenomena which he thought proved sympathy, and were therefore\r\nanalogous in character. Surgeon-General Hammond calls attention to the\r\nfact that these inferences were invariably false. \"It is a very\r\ncurious circumstance,\" says he, \"that of these, there is not one which\r\nis true. Thus he is wrong when he says that if the hand be severely\r\nburnt, the pain and inflammation are relieved by holding it near a hot\r\nfire; that a person who has a bad breath is cured by putting his head\r\nover a privy and inhaling the air which comes from it; that those who\r\nare bitten by vipers or scorpions are cured by holding the bruised\r\nhead of either of those animals, as the case may be, near the bitten\r\npart; that in times of great contagion, carrying a toad, or a spider,\r\nor arsenic or some other venomous substance, about the person is a\r\nprotection; that hanging a toad about the neck of a horse affected\r\nwith farcy dissipates the disease; that water evaporated in a close\r\nroom will not be deposited on the walls, if a vessel of water be\r\nplaced in the room; that venison pies smell strongly at those periods\r\nin which the 'beasts which are of the same nature and kind are in\r\nrut'; that wine in the cellar undergoes a fermentation when the vines\r\nin the field are in flower; that a table-cloth spotted with mulberries\r\nor red wine is more easily whitened at the season in which the plants\r\nare flowering than at any other; that washing the hands in the rays of\r\nmoonlight which fall into a polished silver basin (without water) is a\r\ncure for warts; that a vessel of water put on the hearth of a smoky\r\nchimney is a remedy for the evil, and so on--not a single fact in all\r\nthat he adduces. Yet these circumstances were regarded as real, and\r\nwere spoken of at the times as irrefragable proofs of the truth of Sir\r\nKenelm's views.\"[86]\r\n\r\nWe need have no doubt concerning the operation of sympathetic cures,\r\nfor Sir Kenelm has told us of their virtue in his own words.[87] His\r\nmethod was what was called the cure by the wet way, but the cure could\r\nalso be effected in a dry way. Straus, in a letter to Sir Kenelm,\r\ngives an account of a cure performed by Lord Gilbourne, an English\r\nnobleman, upon a carpenter who had cut himself severely with his axe.\r\n\"The axe, bespattered with blood, was sent for, besmeared with an\r\nanointment, wrapped up warmly, and carefully hung up in a closet. The\r\ncarpenter was immediately relieved, and all went well for some time,\r\nwhen, however, the wound became exceedingly painful, and, upon\r\nresorting to his lordship it was ascertained that the axe had fallen\r\nfrom the nail by which it was suspended, and thereby become\r\nuncovered.\"\r\n\r\nDryden in \"The Tempest\" (Act V, Sc. I) makes Ariel say, in reference\r\nto the wound received by Hippolito from Ferdinand:\r\n\r\n \"He must be dress'd again, as I have done it.\r\n  Anoint the sword which pierced him with this weapon-salve,\r\n     and wrap it close from air, till I have\r\n     time to visit him again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd in the next scene we have the following dialogue between\r\nHippolito and Miranda:\r\n\r\n\"_Hip._ O my wound pains me.\r\n\r\n_Mir._ I am come to ease you.\r\n\r\n                [_She unwraps the sword._\r\n\r\n_Hip._ Alas! I feel the cold air come to me;\r\nMy wound shoots worse than ever.\r\n\r\n                [_She wipes and anoints the sword._\r\n\r\n_Mir._ Does it still grieve you?\r\n\r\n_Hip._ Now methinks, there's something\r\nLaid just upon it.\r\n\r\n_Mir._ Do you find ease?\r\n\r\n_Hip._ Yes, yes, upon the sudden, all the pain\r\nIs leaving me. Sweet heaven, how I am eased!\"\r\n\r\nWerenfels says: \"If the superstitious person be wounded by any chance,\r\nhe applies the salve, not to the wound, but, what is more effectual,\r\nto the weapon by which he received it. By a new kind of art, he will\r\ntransplant his disease, like a scion, and graft it into what tree he\r\npleases.\"\r\n\r\nThe practice at the time was varied and general. All sorts of\r\ndisgusting ingredients were gathered together to form the salve. Some\r\nidea of the condition of the science of medicine at that time may be\r\ngathered when we remember that a serious discussion was long\r\nmaintained between two factions in the sympathetic school concerning\r\nthe question \"whether it was necessary that the moss should grow\r\nabsolutely in the skull of a thief who had hung on the gallows, and\r\nwhether the ointment, while compounding, was to be stirred with a\r\nmurderer's knife.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the sympathetic cures were really the most\r\nrapid and effective. The modern surgeon wonders how a wound ever\r\nhealed prior to this treatment. There seemed to be little that could\r\nbe imagined to prevent a wound from healing that the pre-sympathetic\r\nsurgeon did not try. When the manipulations, doses, and treatments\r\nwere transferred from the wound to the weapon, they did not injure the\r\nweapon, and did give the wound a chance to heal. In fact, leaving out\r\nthe weapon part of the treatment, which could have none but a mental\r\ninfluence, the treatment would be recommended to-day. The wound was\r\nkept clean, the edges were brought in apposition, temperature was\r\nmodified, and rest given. Under these circumstances, wounds which the\r\nsurgeon had irritated so as to take weeks to heal, united in as many\r\ndays. Mark this, however: the wounds treated were simple incisions,\r\nthe ones which most readily united if cleansed, brought together, and\r\nleft alone. Gunshot and similar wounds were not treated by this\r\nprocess.[88]\r\n\r\n  [76] T. J. Pettigrew, _Superstitions Connected\r\n  with ...

He\r\n  wears Paracelsian characters for the toothache; and a\r\n  little hallowed wax is his antidote for all\r\n  evils.\"--BISHOP HALL.\r\n\r\n  \"Neither doth Fansie only cause, but also as easily cure\r\n  Diseases; as I may justly refer all magical and jugling\r\n  Cures thereunto, performed, as is thought, by Saints,\r\n  Images, Relicts, Holy-Waters, Shrines, Avemarys,\r\n  Crucifixes, Benedictions, Charms, Characters, Sigils of\r\n  the Planets and of Signs, inverted Words, &c., and\r\n  therefore all such Cures are rather to be ascribed to\r\n  the Force of the Imagination, than any virtue in them,\r\n  or their Rings, Amulets, Lamens, &c.\"--RAMESEY.\r\n\r\nAttention has already been called to the fact that the characteristic\r\nof the amulet is that it must be worn about the person, while the\r\ntalisman may simply be in possession of a person wherever it may be,\r\nor deposited at a certain place by or for the person. The Arabic\r\nequivalent of the word Amulet means \"that which is suspended.\"\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word is uncertain, but there are at least two\r\nLatin antecedents claimed for it. Some claim that it is derived from the\r\nbarbarous Latin word \"amuletum,\" from amolior, to remove; others\r\nconsider that it comes from \"amula,\" the name of a small vessel with\r\nlustral water in it, which the Romans sometimes carried in their pockets\r\nfor purification and expiation. Pliny says that many of these amulae were\r\ncarved out of pieces of amber and hung about children's necks. Whatever\r\nthe derivation of the word, it is doubtless of Eastern origin.\r\n\r\nThere is also little doubt concerning the early belief in the efficacy\r\nof an amulet to ward off diseases, and to protect against supernatural\r\nagencies. So powerful were they supposed to be that an oath was\r\nformerly administered to persons about to fight a legal duel \"that\r\nthey had ne charme ne herb of virtue.\" St. Chrysostom and others of\r\nthe church fathers condemned the practice very severely, and the\r\nCouncil of Laodicea (366) wisely forbade the priesthood from studying\r\nand practising enchantments, mathematics, astrology, and the binding\r\nof the soul by amulets.[89]\r\n\r\nBurton has the following passage on the subject: \"Amulets, and Things\r\nto be borne about, I find prescribed, taxed by some, approved by\r\nRenodeus, Platerus, and others; looke for them in Mizaldus, Porta,\r\nAlbertus, &c.... A Ring made of the Hoofe of an Asse's right\r\nfore-foot carried about, &c. I say with Renodeus they are not\r\naltogether to be rejected. Piony doth help epilepsies. Pretious\r\nStones, most diseases. A Wolf's dung carried about helps the Cholick.\r\nA spider, an Ague, &c.... Some Medicines are to be exploded, that\r\nconsist of Words, Characters, Spells, and Charms, which can do no good\r\nat all, but out of a strong conceit, as Pomponatius proves; or the\r\nDevil's policy, who is the first founder and teacher of them.\"[90]\r\n\r\n\"To this kind,\" says Bingham, \"belong all Ligatures and Remedies,\r\nwhich the Schools of Physitians reject and condemn; whether in\r\nInchantments or in certain marks, which they call Characters, or in\r\nsome other things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body, and\r\nkept in a dancing posture. Such are Ear-rings hanged upon the tip of\r\neach ear, and Rings made of an Ostriche's bones for the Finger; or,\r\nwhen you are told, in a fit of Convulsions or shortness of Breath, to\r\nhold your left Thumb with your right hand.\"[91]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the wearing of amulets did not stop with the early\r\ncivilizations or even with the Middle Ages. People in our own\r\nsupposedly enlightened age indulge in them. The negro carries the hind\r\nfoot of a rabbit, and the children see great virtue in a four-leafed\r\nclover; men carry luck pennies, and certain stones are worn in rings\r\nand scarf pins; camphor is worn about the person to avert febrile\r\ncontagion, and anodyne necklaces of \"Job's tears\" and other equally\r\nharmless and inefficacious substances are placed on babies to assist\r\nthem in teething. The camphor and necklaces are probably not supposed\r\nto be endowed with magical power, but a mistaken medical virtue is\r\nassigned to them.\r\n\r\nThere was neither rule nor reason for the composition of most amulets,\r\nand one would have to be well acquainted with the superstitions of the\r\nvarious ages to account for them. Sometimes the shape, rather than the\r\nmaterial of which they were composed or the inscription on them, was\r\nthe efficacious factor. Perhaps material, shape, and inscription would\r\nbe combined in one object; or many objects, each purporting to contain\r\nmagical properties, might be grouped for special efficacy, as when\r\ninscribed pieces of different stones of peculiar shape were formed\r\ninto necklaces or bracelets.\r\n\r\nPrecious stones were often employed as amulets, and some even ground\r\nthem up and took them internally in order to be more sure of their\r\nmagical effects. \"Butler quotes from Encelius, who says that the\r\nGarnet, if hung about the neck or taken in drink, much assisteth\r\nsorrow and recreates the heart; and the chrysolite is described as the\r\nfriend of wisdom and the enemy of folly. Renodeus admires precious\r\nstones because they adorn king's crowns, grace the fingers, enrich our\r\nhousehold stuff, defend us from enchantments, preserve health, cure\r\ndiseases, drive away grief, cares, and exhilarate the mind.\"[92]\r\n\r\nSome further quotations portray to us the efficacy of other stones:\r\n\r\n  \"Heliotropius stauncheth blood, driveth away poisons,\r\n  preserveth health; yea, and some write that it provoketh\r\n  raine, and darkeneth the sunne, suffering not him that\r\n  beareth it to be abused.\"\r\n\r\n  \"A topaze healeth the lunaticke person of his passion of\r\n  lunacie.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Corneolus (cornelian) mitigateth the heate of the\r\n  minde, and qualifieth malice, it stancheth bloodie\r\n  fluxes.\"\r\n\r\n  \"A sapphire preserveth the members and maketh them\r\n  livelie, and helpeth agues and gowts, and suffereth not\r\n  the bearer to be afraid; it hath virtue against venoms,\r\n  and staieth bleeding at the nose, being often put\r\n  thereto.\"\r\n\r\n  Aetius \"attributed great obstetrical properties to the\r\n  lapis aetites, and gagates stone. The sapphire when\r\n  taken as a potion pulverized in milk, cured internal\r\n  ulcers and checked excessive perspiration. The amargdine\r\n  was highly recommended for strabismus....\"\r\n\r\n  \"Jasper, hematite and hieratite stones were strongly\r\n  recommended for unusual sanative virtues, but the\r\n  sapphire excelled as a remedy for scorpion bites.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The Bezoar stone had a great reputation in melancholic\r\n  affections. Manardus says it removes sadness and makes\r\n  him merry that useth it.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Noblemen wore the smargdum attached to a chain, in the\r\n  belief of its potential virtues against epilepsy. The\r\n  sard prevented terrible dreams, and the cornelian worn\r\n  on the finger or suspended from the neck pacified anger\r\n  and provoked contentment. Onyx superinduced troubled\r\n  sleep, but fastened to the throat, stimulated the\r\n  salivary glands. Saphirs cured internal ulcers and\r\n  excessive perspiration, when taken as a potion dissolved\r\n  in lacteal fluids.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Of the stone which hight agate. It is said that it hath\r\n  eight virtues. One is when there is thunder, it doth not\r\n  scathe the man who hath this stone with him. Another\r\n  virtue is, on whatsoever house it is, therein a fiend\r\n  may not be. The third virtue is, that no venom may\r\n  scathe the man who hath the stone with him. The fourth\r\n  virtue is, that the man, who hath on him secretly the\r\n  loathly fiend, if he taketh in liquid any portion of the\r\n  shavings of the stone, then soon is exhibited manifestly\r\n  in him, that which before lay secretly hid. The fifth\r\n  virtue is, he who is afflicted with any disease, if he\r\n  taketh the stone in liquid, it is soon well with him.\r\n  The sixth virtue is, that sorcery hurteth not the man\r\n  who has the stone with him. The seventh virtue is, that\r\n  he who taketh the stone in drink, will have so much the\r\n  smoother body. The eighth virtue of the stone is, that\r\n  no bite of any kind of snake may scathe him who tasteth\r\n  the stone in liquid.\"\r\n\r\nEven as late as 1624, Sir John Harrington, writing in his \"School of\r\nSalerne,\" says: \"Alwaies in your hands use eyther Corall or yellow\r\nAmber, or a chalcedonium, or a sweet Pommander, or some like precious\r\nstone to be worne in a ring upon the little finger of the left hand;\r\nhave in your rings eyther a Smaragd, a Saphire, or a Draconites, which\r\nyou shall bear for an ornament; for in stones, as also in hearbes,\r\nthere is great efficacie and vertue, but they are not altogether\r\nperceived by us; hold sometime in your mouth eyther a Hyacinth, or a\r\nCrystall, or a Garnat, or pure Gold, or Silver, or else sometimes pure\r\nSugar-candy. For Aristotle doth affirme, and so doth Albertus Magnus,\r\nthat a Smaragd worne about the necke, is good against the\r\nFalling-sickness; for surely the virtue of an hearbe is great, but\r\nmuch more the vertue of a precious stone, which is very likely that\r\nthey are endued with occult and hidden vertues.\"\r\n\r\nPrecious metals as well as precious stones were used in the\r\nmanufacture of amulets. The Scandinavians carried metal effigies\r\ncarved out of gold or silver, or incised upon tiles, perpetually as\r\namulets. They were safeguards against diseases and physical\r\ninfirmities. They were also administered internally in cases where\r\npowerful cures were needed. Chaucer says:\r\n\r\n \"For gold in physic is a cordial,\r\n  Therefore he loved gold in special.\"\r\n\r\nThe Basilideans, and other sects developed from the Gnostic systems,\r\nassigned great power to stone amulets, and prepared them for their\r\ninitiates, who used them for identification and for curative purposes.\r\nThey quickly acquired a celebrity undiminished for ages, and were\r\nknown under the general name of Abraxas. They were composed of various\r\nmaterials, glass, paste, sometimes metals, but principally of various\r\nkinds of stones. Through the irresistible might of Abrax, their\r\nsupreme divinity, the Basilideans were protected and cured. Clement of\r\nAlexandria strictly interdicted the use of gems for personal\r\nornamentation, with evident allusion to the Abraxas stones. These\r\nstones had various inscriptions carved upon them, most of which had\r\nsome hidden meaning of great puissance. One of them, for example, is\r\nengraven with Armenian letters, and contains a standing invocation for\r\nfruitful delivery; in its medicinal property it was evidently a cure\r\nfor sterility.[93]\r\n\r\nFrom the stone itself the word \"Abraxas\" came to be used as an amulet\r\nwhen written on paper. The numerical equivalent of the Greek letters\r\nwhen added together thus, A = 1, B = 2, R = 100, A = 1, X = 60, A = 1,\r\nS = 200, is 365. The significance of this was that the deity was the\r\nruler of 365 heavens, or of the angels inhabiting these heavens; he\r\nwas also ruler over the 365 days of the year. Notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat it was referred to by the Greek fathers, the name was evidently\r\nEgyptian in origin, some of the figures on the stones being strictly\r\nEgyptian.\r\n\r\nAmulets in the form of inscriptions were called \"Characts,\" the word\r\nAbraxas being an example. The very powerful word \"Abracadabra\" was\r\nderived from Abraxas, and when written in the proper way and worn\r\nabout the person was supposed to have a magical efficacy as an\r\nantidote against ague, fever, flux, and toothache. Serenus Samonicus,\r\na physician in the reign of Caracalla, recommends it very highly for\r\nague, instructing how it should be written, and commanding it to be\r\nworn around the neck. It might be written in either of two ways:\r\nreading down the left side and up the right must spell the same word\r\nas at the top; or, having the left side always start the same, reading\r\nup the right side should be the same as the top line. Below are the\r\ntwo forms:\r\n\r\n          ABRACADABRA            ABRACADABRA\r\n           BRACADABR              ABRACADABR\r\n            RACADAB                ABRACADAB\r\n             ACADA                  ABRACADA\r\n              CAD                    ABRACAD\r\n               A                      ABRACA\r\n                                       ABRAC\r\n                                        ABRA\r\n                                         ABR\r\n                                          AB\r\n                                           A\r\n\r\nJulius Africanus says that pronouncing the word in the same manner is\r\nas efficacious as writing it. The Jews attributed an equal virtue to\r\nthe word \"Aracalan\" employed in the same way.[94]\r\n\r\nBishop Pilkington, writing in 1561, protests against a then current\r\npractice in this way: \"What wicket blindenes is this than, to thinke\r\nthat wearing Prayers written in rolles about with theym, as S. Johns\r\nGospell, the length of our Lord, the measure of our Lady, or other\r\nlike, thei shall die no sodain death, nor be hanged, or yf he be\r\nhanged, he shall not die. There is so manye suche, though ye laugh,\r\nand beleve it not, and not hard to shewe them with a wet finger.\" The\r\nsame author observes that our devotion ought to \"stande in depe sighes\r\nand groninges, wyth a full consideration of our miserable state and\r\nGoddes majestye, in the heart, and not in ynke or paper: not in\r\nhangyng writtin Scrolles about the Necke, but lamentinge unfeignedlye\r\nour Synnes from the hart.\"\r\n\r\nThe following charact was found in a linen purse belonging to a\r\nmurderer named Jackson, who died in Chichester jail in February, 1749.\r\nHe was \"struck with such horror on being measured for his chains that\r\nhe soon after expired.\"\r\n\r\n \"Ye three holy Kings,\r\n  Gaspar, Melchior, Balthasar,\r\n  Pray for us now, and in the hour of our death.\"\r\n\r\n  \"These papers have touched the three heads of the holy\r\n  Kings at Cologne. They are to preserve travellers from\r\n  accidents on the road, headaches, falling sickness,\r\n  fevers, witchcraft, all kinds of mischief, and sudden\r\n  death.\"\r\n\r\nBelgrave prescribes a cure of agues, by a certain writing which the\r\npatient wears, as follows: \"When Jesus went up to the Cross to be\r\ncrucified, the Jews asked him, saying Art thou afraid? or hast thou\r\nthe ague? Jesus answered and said, I am not afraid, neither have I the\r\nague. All those which bear the name of Jesus about them shall not be\r\nafraid, nor yet have the ague. Amen, sweet Jesus, Amen, sweet Jehovah,\r\nAmen.\" He adds: \"I have known many who have been cured of the ague by\r\nthis writing only worn about them; and I had the receipt from one\r\nwhose daughter was cured thereby, who had the ague upon her two\r\nyears.\"[95]\r\n\r\nAmong other written amulets, the first Psalm, when written on doeskin,\r\nwas supposed to be efficacious in childbirth. It was necessary,\r\nhowever, for the writer of such amulets to plunge into a bath as soon\r\nas he had written one line, and after every new line it was thought\r\nnecessary that he should repeat the plunge.\r\n\r\nThe following process for avoiding inflamed eyes is taken from\r\nMarcellus, 380 A. D.: \"Write on a clean sheet of paper [Greek:\r\noubaik], and hang this round the patient's neck, with a thread from\r\nthe loom. In a state of purity and chastity write on a clean sheet of\r\npaper [Greek: phyrpharan] and hang it round the man's neck; it will\r\nstop the approach of inflammation. The following will stop\r\ninflammation coming on, written on a clean sheet of paper: [Greek:\r\nroubos rnoneiras reelios os. kantephora kai pantes eakotei]; it must\r\nbe hung to the neck by a thread; and if both the patient and operator\r\nare in a state of chastity, it will stop inveterate inflammation.\r\nAgain, write on a thin plate of gold with a needle of copper, [Greek:\r\norno ourode]; do this on a Monday; observe chastity; it will long and\r\nmuch avail.\"[96]\r\n\r\nIn Africa, prayers taken from the Koran are written and worn as\r\namulets at the present time.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the philosopher Pascal some manuscript was found\r\nsewed in his doublet. This was a \"profession of faith\" which he always\r\nwore stitched in his clothing as a sort of amulet.\r\n\r\nIn the East, generally, the amulet consists of certain names of the\r\nDeity, verses of the Koran, or particular passages compressed into a\r\nvery small space, and is to be found concealed in the turban. The\r\nChristians wore amulets with verses selected from the Old and New\r\nTestaments, and particularly from the Gospel of John. The amulets or\r\ncharms, called \"grigris\" by the African priests, are of similar\r\ndescription. These were used for preservatives against thunderbolts\r\nand diseases, to procure many wives and to give them easy deliveries,\r\nto avert shipwreck or slavery, and to secure victory in battle. One,\r\nto be used for the last purpose, which had belonged to a king of Brak,\r\nin Senegal, was found on his body after he had the misfortune to be\r\nkilled in battle with the amulet upon him. It had the following\r\nsentences from the Koran: \"In the name of the merciful God! Pray to\r\nGod through our Lord Mohammed. All that exists is so only by his\r\ncommand. He gives life, and also calls sinners to an account. He\r\ndeprives us of life by the sole power of his name: these are\r\nundeniable truths. He that lives owes his life to the peculiar\r\nclemency of his Lord, who by his providence takes care of his\r\nsubsistence. He is a wise prince or governor.\"[97]\r\n\r\nThe Jews used as amulets some sacred name, such as the true\r\npronunciation of the name of Jehovah, written down. The Mischna\r\npermitted the Jews to wear amulets provided they had been found\r\nefficacious in at least three cases by an approved person. One of the\r\nmost famous amulets is that known as \"Solomon's Seal.\"\r\n\r\nLigatures, similar to the earlier amulets, a heritage from the\r\nnorthern pagan races, were freely applied for the prevention and cure\r\nof maladies.\r\n\r\nAfter imposing invocations and the addition of mystical characters,\r\nthese medical charms were presumed to be of the greatest efficacy, and\r\nready for suspension from the neck. Their efficacy was admitted by\r\nChristians, but they were condemned on account of their pagan and\r\nconsequently satanic origin.\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles recommended a number of amulets, some of which I\r\nwill mention later, but admits that he had no faith in them, but\r\nmerely ordered them as placebos for rich and fastidious patients who\r\ncould not be persuaded to adopt a more rational treatment. Baas tells\r\nus that \"A regular Pagan amulet was found in 1749 on the breast of the\r\nprince bishop Anselm Franz of Wurzburg, count of Ingolstadt, after his\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nAmulets were also worn to protect the wearer from charms exercised by\r\nothers. The \"Leech Book\" gives us one to be worn and another to be\r\ntaken internally for this purpose. To be used \"against every evil rune\r\nlay, and one full of elvish tricks, writ for the bewitched man, this\r\nwriting in Greek letters: Alfa, Omega, Iesvm, BERONIKH. Again, another\r\ndust and drink against a rune lay; take a bramble apple, and lupins,\r\nand pulegium, pound them, then sift them, put them in a pouch, lay\r\nthem under the altar, sing nine masses over them, administer this to\r\ndrink at three hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe powers of the mandragora, as an amulet, place it almost in a class\r\nby itself. Fort tells us that in addition to its power to protect\r\nherds of cattle and horses, to prevent misfortunes of various kinds,\r\nto preserve the exhilarating wine and beer against loss of their\r\nintoxicating property, to render successful commercial negotiations,\r\nand promote infallibly, rapid and enormous influence, \"other virtues\r\nof a surprising character were awarded the omnipotent mandragora. It\r\nconciliated affection and maintained friendship, preserved conjugal\r\nfealty and developed benevolence. The immensity of worth inherent in\r\nthis mystical medicament, its vital essence, was by no means confined\r\nto sustaining health and providing certain remedies for infirmities;\r\nits power manipulated tribunals and secured judicial favor at court;\r\nand when this resistless amulet was held under the arm by a suitor at\r\nlaw, however unjust his cause, the vegetable Rune controlled the forum\r\nand obtained the verdict.\"[98]\r\n\r\nIt may be well at this point to enumerate at least a number of the\r\nmost noted amulets, according to the disease for which they were\r\nsupposed to be efficacious.\r\n\r\n_Ague._--On account of the periodic character of this disease it was\r\nconsidered to be a supernatural complaint and hence many unnatural\r\ncures were suggested, among which were a number of amulets. The\r\nAbracadabra amulet was supposed to be especially efficacious in ague.\r\nThe chips of a gallows put into a bag and worn around the neck, or\r\nnext the skin, have been said to have served as a cure, at least, so\r\nreports Brand.[99] Millefolium or yarrow, worn in a little bag on the\r\npit of the stomach is reported to have cured this disease, and\r\nAlexander of Tralles advises, for a quartan ague, that the patient\r\nmust carry about some hairs from a goat's chin.[100]\r\n\r\nElias Ashmole, in his Diary, April 11, 1681, has entered the\r\nfollowing: \"I tooke early in the morning a good dose of Elixir, and\r\nhung three spiders about my neck, and they drove my Ague away. Deo\r\nGratias!\"[101]\r\n\r\nWristbands, called pericarpia, were employed in the cure. Robert Boyle\r\nsays he was cured of a violent quotidian ague, after having in vain\r\nresorted to medical aid, by applying to his wrists \"a mixture of two\r\nhandfuls of bay salt, the same quantity of fresh English hops, and a\r\nquarter of a pound of blue currants, very diligently beaten into a\r\nbrittle mass, without the addition of anything moist, and so spread\r\nupon linen and applied to his wrists.\"[102]\r\n\r\nBurton gives us a leaf from his own experience.[103] \"Being in the\r\ncountry in the vacation time, not many years since, at Lindly, in\r\nLeicestershire, my father's house, I first observed this amulet of a\r\nspider in a nut-shell, wrapped in silk, &c., so applyed for an ague by\r\nmy mother; whom, although I knew to have excellent skill in\r\nchirurgery, sore eyes, aches, &c., and such experimental medicines, as\r\nall the country where she dwelt can witness, to have done many famous\r\nand good cures upon divers poor folks that were otherwise destitute of\r\nhelp, yet among all other experiments, this methought was most absurd\r\nand ridiculous. I could see no warrant for it. _Quid aranea cum\r\nFebre?_ For what antipathy? till at length rambling amongst authors\r\n(as I often do), I found this very medicine in Dioscorides, approved\r\nby Matthiolus, repeated by Aldrovandus, _cap. de Aranea, lib. de\r\nInsectis_, I began to have a better opinion of it, and to give more\r\ncredit to amulets, when I saw it in some parties answer to\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nA narrative of not a little interest, concerning Sir John Holt, Lord\r\nChief Justice of the Court of King's Bench, 1709, should be given in\r\nthis connection. He was extremely wild in his youth, and being once\r\nengaged with some of his rakish friends in a trip into the country, in\r\nwhich they had spent all their money, it was agreed they should try\r\ntheir fortune separately. Holt arrived at an inn at the end of a\r\nstraggling village, ordered his horse to be taken care of, bespoke a\r\nsupper and a bed. He then strolled into the kitchen, where he observed\r\na little girl of thirteen shaking with ague. Upon making inquiry\r\nrespecting her, the landlady told him that she was her only child, and\r\nhad been ill nearly a year, notwithstanding all the assistance she\r\ncould procure for her from physic. He gravely shook his head at the\r\ndoctors, bade her be under no further concern, for that her daughter\r\nshould never have another fit. He then wrote a few unintelligible\r\nwords in a court hand on a scrap of parchment, which had been the\r\ndirection fixed to a hamper, and rolling it up, directed that it\r\nshould be bound upon the girl's wrist and there allowed to remain\r\nuntil she was well. The ague returned no more; and Holt, having\r\nremained in the house a week, called for his bill. \"God bless you,\r\nsir,\" said the old woman, \"you're nothing in my debt, I'm sure. I\r\nwish, on the contrary, that I was able to pay you for the cure which\r\nyou have made of my daughter. Oh! if I had had the happiness to see\r\nyou ten months ago, it would have saved me forty pounds.\" With\r\npretended reluctance he accepted his accommodation as a recompense,\r\nand rode away. Many years elapsed, Holt advanced in his profession of\r\nthe law, and went a circuit, as one of the judges of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, into the same county, where, among other criminals\r\nbrought before him, was an old woman under a charge of witchcraft. To\r\nsupport this accusation, several witnesses swore that the prisoner had\r\na spell with which she could either cure such cattle as were sick or\r\ndestroy those that were well, and that in the use of this spell she\r\nhad been lately detected, and that it was now ready to be produced in\r\ncourt. Upon this statement the judge desired that it might be handed\r\nup to him. It was a dirty ball, wrapped round with several rags, and\r\nbound with packthread. These coverings he carefully removed, and\r\nbeneath them found a piece of parchment which he immediately\r\nrecognized as his own youthful fabrication. For a few moments he\r\nremained silent. At length, recollecting himself, he addressed the\r\njury to the following effect: \"Gentlemen, I must now relate a\r\nparticular of my life, which very ill suits my present character and\r\nthe station in which I sit; but to conceal it would be to aggravate\r\nthe folly for which I ought to atone, to endanger innocence, and to\r\ncountenance superstition. This bauble, which you suppose to have the\r\npower of life and death, is a senseless scroll which I wrote with my\r\nown hand and gave to this woman, whom for no other reason you accuse\r\nas a witch.\" He then related the particulars of the transaction, with\r\nsuch an effect upon the minds of the people that his old landlady was\r\nthe last person tried for witchcraft in that county.[104]\r\n\r\n_Calculus._--Boyle tells us[105] that the _Lapis Nephriticus_, a\r\nspecies of jasper, when bound to the left wrist, was a cure for this\r\ntrouble. Others have borne evidence to its efficacy.\r\n\r\n_Childbirth._--Among the ancient Britons, when a birth was difficult\r\nor dangerous, a girdle, made for this purpose, was put around the\r\nwoman and afforded immediate relief. Until quite recently they were\r\nkept by many families in the Highlands of Scotland. They were marked\r\nwith certain figures and were applied with certain ceremonies derived\r\nfrom the Druids. Women in labor were also supposed to be quickly\r\ndelivered if they were girded with the skin which a snake has sloughed\r\noff.[106]\r\n\r\n_Cholera._--Bontius declared the _Lapis Porcinus_ to be good for\r\ncholera, but dangerous to pregnant women. If the females of Malaica\r\nheld the stone in their hands an abortion was produced. When cholera\r\nwas prevalent during the early part of the last century, it was common\r\nin many parts of Austria, Germany, and Italy to wear an amulet at the\r\npit of the stomach, in contact with the skin. Pettigrew describes one\r\nof these which was sent to him from Hungary. \"It consists merely of a\r\ncircular piece of copper two inches and a half in diameter, and is\r\nwithout characters.\"\r\n\r\n_Colic._--Says Pliny, the extremity of the intestine of the ossifrage,\r\nif worn as an amulet, is well known to be an excellent remedy for\r\ncolic. A tick from a dog's left ear, worn as an amulet, was\r\nrecommended to allay this and all other kinds of pain, but one must be\r\ncareful to take it from a dog that is black. Alexander of Tralles\r\nrecommended the heart of a lark to be fastened to the left thigh as a\r\nremedy for colic. Mr. Cockayne, the editor of _Saxon Leechdoms_, gives\r\nus further remedies for colic which Alexander prescribed. \"Thus for\r\ncolic, he guarantees by his own experience, and the approval of almost\r\nall the best doctors, dung of a wolf, with bits of bone in it if\r\npossible, shut up in a pipe, and worn during the paroxysm, on the\r\nright arm, or thigh, or hip, taking care it touches neither the earth\r\nor a bath.\"[107]\r\n\r\n_Cramp._--The following amulets are mentioned as specifics against\r\ncramp:\r\n\r\n\"--Wear bone Ring on thumb, or tye Strong Pack-thread below your\r\nthigh.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of cramp rings will be considered in another connection.\r\n\r\n_Demoniacal Possession._--In the sixth century exorcists frequently\r\nwrote the formula on parchment and suspended it from the neck of the\r\npatient. This was as efficacious as the uttered words.\r\n\r\n_Epilepsy._--The elder tree has been the foundation of many\r\nsuperstitions, chief among which have been some connected with\r\nepilepsy. Blochwick[108] tells us how to prepare an amulet from an\r\nelder growing on a sallow. \"In the month of October, a little before\r\nthe full moon, you pluck a twig of the elder, and cut the cane that is\r\nbetwixt two of its knees, or knots, in nine pieces, and these pieces\r\nbeing bound in a piece of linen, be in a thread, so hung about the\r\nneck, that they touch the spoon of the heart, or the sword-formed\r\ncartilage; and that they may stay more firmly in that place, they are\r\nto be bound thereon with a linen or silken roller wrapt about the\r\nbody, till the thread break of itself. The thread being broken and the\r\nroller removed, the amulet is not at all to be touched with bare\r\nhands, but it ought to be taken hold on by some instrument and buried\r\nin a place that nobody may touch it.\" Some hung a cross, made of the\r\nelder and the sallow entwined, about the children's neck.\r\n\r\nRings of various kinds have always been supposed to have some\r\nsuperstitious power. Brand[109] tells us of some of their uses. A ring\r\nmade from a piece of silver collected at the communion is a cure for\r\nconvulsions and fits of every kind. If the silver is collected on\r\nEaster Sunday its efficacy is greatly increased. This was the receipt\r\nin Berkshire, but in Devonshire silver was not necessary. Here they\r\nprefer a ring made from three nails or screws dug out of a\r\nchurch-yard, which had been used to fasten a coffin. We are also\r\ninformed that another kind of ring will cure fits. It must be made\r\nfrom five sixpences collected from five different bachelors, conveyed\r\nby the hand of a bachelor to a silversmith who is a bachelor. None of\r\nthe persons who gave the sixpences, however, are to know for what\r\npurpose, or to whom, they gave them.[110]\r\n\r\nA silver ring contributed by twelve young women, and constantly worn\r\non one of the pattens fingers, has been successfully employed in the\r\ncure of epilepsy after various medical means failed.[111] Lupton\r\nsays: \"A piece of a child's navel-string borne in a ring is good\r\nagainst the falling-sickness, the pains of the head, and the\r\ncollick.\"[112]\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles recommended for epilepsy a metal cross tied to\r\nthe arm, or, in lieu of that, bits of sail-cloth from a shipwrecked\r\nvessel might be tied to the right arm and worn for seven weeks; the\r\nlatter was a preventive as well as a cure. Among the ancients,\r\nSerapion prescribed crocodile's dung and turtle's blood as a cure for\r\nthis disease.[113] Lemius remarks that \"Coral, Piony, Misseltoe, drive\r\naway the falling Sicknesse, either hung about the neck or drunk with\r\nwine.\"\r\n\r\n_Erysipelas._--The elder seems to have been efficacious in erysipelas\r\nas well as in epilepsy, at least so we are told in the \"Anatomie of\r\nthe Elder.\" The following is the method of preparing the amulet. It is\r\nto be made of \"Elder on which the sun never shined. If the piece\r\nbetwixt the two knots be hung about the patient's neck, it is much\r\ncommended. Some cut it in little pieces, and sew it in a knot in a\r\npiece of a man's shirt, which seems superstitious.\"\r\n\r\n_Evil-eye._--Coral was supposed to avert the baneful consequences of\r\nthe evil-eye, and Paracelsus recommends it to be worn about the necks\r\nof children. Douce has given engravings of several Roman amulets\r\nwhich were intended to be used against fascinations in general, but\r\nmore particularly against that of the evil-eye.[114]\r\n\r\n_Eye Diseases._--Cotta relates, so says Pettigrew, \"a merrie historie\r\nof an approved famous spell for sore eyes. By many honest testimonies\r\nit was a long time worne as a Jewell about many necks, written in\r\npaper and enclosed in silke, never failing to do sovereigne good when\r\nall other helpes were helplesse. No sight might dare to reade or open.\r\nAt length a curious mind, while the patient slept, by stealth ripped\r\nopen the mystical cover, and found the powerful characters Latin:\r\n'Diabolus effodiat tibi oculos impleat foramina stercoribus.'\"\r\n\r\nVivisection was practised to procure an amulet for sore eyes,\r\naccording to the following prescription: \"If a man have a white spot,\r\nas cataract, in his eye, catch a fox alive, cut his tongue out, let\r\nhim go, dry his tongue and tie it up in a red rag and hang it round\r\nthe man's neck.\" Pliny's way was to \"take the tongue of a foxe, and\r\nhange the same about his necke, so long it hangeth there his sight\r\nshall not wax feeble.\"\r\n\r\nLike was also used to cure like, at least in the following directions:\r\n\"Take the right eye of a Frogg, lap it in a piece of russet cloth and\r\nhang it about the neck; it cureth the right eye if it bee enflamed or\r\nbleared. And if the left eye be greved, do the like by the left eye of\r\nthe said Frogg.\"[115]\r\n\r\n_Fevers._--Charms rather than amulets were employed in fevers, yet we\r\nfind that among the ancients Chrysippus believed in amulets for\r\nquartan fevers and Pliny taught that the longest tooth of a black dog\r\ncured quartan fevers.\r\n\r\n_Gout._--Alexander of Tralles has preserved for us a remedy for gout\r\nas follows: \"A remedy for the gout. Write, on a golden plate at the\r\nwane of the moon, what follows, rolling round it the sinews of a\r\ncrane. Put it in a little bag, and wear it near the ankles. The words\r\nare meu, treu, mor, phor, teux, za, zor, phe, lou, chri, ge, ze, ou,\r\nas the sun is consolidated in these names, and is renewed every day;\r\nso consolidate this plaster as it was before, now, now, quick, quick,\r\nfor, behold, I pronounce the great name, in which are consolidated\r\nthings in repose, iaz, azuf, zuon, threux, bain, choog; consolidate\r\nthis plaster as it was at first, now, now, quick, quick.\"\r\n\r\n_Headache._--Pliny's amulet for this disease was an herb picked from\r\nthe head of a statue, tied with a red thread, and worn upon the body.\r\n\r\n_Hysteria._--Monardes is quoted as saying: \"When hysterical persons\r\nfeel an attack coming on, they may be relieved by a stone, which will\r\nprevent, if constantly worn about the person, any subsequent attack.\r\nFrom my knowledge of cases of this kind, I attach credit to this\r\namulet.\"\r\n\r\n_Melancholy._--Burton has treated much under the name of melancholy,\r\nand in respect of cure mentions several \"amulets and things to be\r\nborne about.\" He recommends for head melancholy such things as\r\nhypericon, or St. John's-wort, gathered on a Friday in the hour of\r\nJupiter, \"... borne or hung about the neck, it mightily helps this\r\naffection, and drives away all fantastical spirits.\"[116]\r\n\r\n_Plague._--During the visitations of the plague, the inhabitants of\r\nLondon wore, in the region of the heart, amulets composed of arsenic,\r\nprobably on account of the theory that one poison would neutralize the\r\npower of the other. Concerning this, however, Herring, in writing\r\nconcerning preservatives against the pestilence, says: \"Perceiving\r\nmany in this Citie to weare about their Necks, upon the region of the\r\nHeart, certaine Placents or Amulets, (as preservatives against the\r\npestilence,) confected of Arsenicke, my opinion is that they are so\r\nfarre from effecting any good in that kinde, as a preservative, that\r\nthey are very dangerous and hurtfull, if not pernitious, to those that\r\nweare them.\" Quills of quicksilver were commonly worn about the neck\r\nfor the same purpose, and the powder of toad was employed in a similar\r\nway.\r\n\r\nPope Adrian is reported to have continually carried an amulet composed\r\nof dried toad, arsenic, tormental, pearl, coral, hyacinth, smarag, and\r\ntragacanth. Among the Harleian Manuscripts is a letter from Lord\r\nChancellor Hatton to Sir Thomas Smith written at a time of an alarming\r\nepidemic. Among other things he writes: \"I am likewise bold to\r\nrecommend my most humble duty to our dear mistress (Queen Elizabeth)\r\nby this LETTER AND RING, which hath the virtue to expell infectious\r\nairs, and is _to be worn betwixt the sweet duggs_, the chaste nest of\r\npure constancy. I trust, sir, when the virtue is known, it shall not\r\nbe refused for the value.\"[117]\r\n\r\n_Safety from Wounds._--Pettigrew gives us the two following examples:\r\n\"De Barros, the historian, says that the Portuguese in vain attempted\r\nto destroy a Malay so long as he wore a bracelet containing a bone set\r\nin gold, which rendered him proof against their swords. This amulet\r\nwas afterward transmitted to the Viceroy Alfonso d'Alboquerque, as a\r\nvaluable present.\r\n\r\n\"In the travels of Marco Polo, we read that in an attempt by Kublai\r\nKhan to make a conquest of the island of Zipangu, a jealousy arose\r\nbetween the two commanders of the expedition, which led to an order\r\nfor putting the whole of the inhabitants of the garrison to the sword;\r\nand that in obedience thereto, the heads of all were cut off,\r\nexcepting of eight persons, who, by the efficacy of a diabolical\r\ncharm, consisting of a jewel or amulet introduced into the right arm,\r\nbetween the skin and the flesh, were rendered secure from the effects\r\nof iron, either to kill or wound. Upon this discovery being made, they\r\nwere beaten with a heavy wooden club, and presently died.\"[118]\r\n\r\n_Scrofula._--Lupton says: \"The Root of Vervin hanged at the neck of\r\nsuch as have the King's Evil, it brings a marvellous and unhoped\r\nhelp.\" To this Brand adds: \"Squire Morley of Essex used to say a\r\nPrayer which he hoped would do no harm when he hung a bit of vervain\r\nroot from a scrophulous person's neck. My aunt Freeman had a very high\r\nopinion of a baked Toad in a silk Bag, hung round the neck.\"[119]\r\n\r\n_Toothache._--People in North Hampshire, England, sometimes wore a\r\ntooth taken from a corpse, kept in a bag and hung around the neck, as\r\na remedy for toothache.\r\n\r\n_Whooping-Cough._--About the middle of the last century there appeared\r\nthe following in the _London Athenaeum_: \"The popular belief as to the\r\norigin of the mark across the back of the ass is mentioned by Sir\r\nThomas Browne, in his 'Vulgar Errors,' and from whatever cause it may\r\nhave arisen it is certain that the hairs taken from the part of the\r\nanimal so marked are held in high estimation as a cure for the\r\nhooping-cough. In this metropolis, at least so lately as 1842, an\r\nelderly lady advised a friend who had a child dangerously ill with\r\nthat complaint, to procure three such hairs, and hang them round the\r\nneck of the sufferer in a muslin bag. It was added that the animal\r\nfrom whom the hairs are taken for this purpose is never worth anything\r\nafterwards, and, consequently, great difficulty would be experienced\r\nin procuring them; and further, that it was essential to the success\r\nof the charm that the sex of the animal, from whom the hairs were to\r\nbe procured, should be the contrary to that of the party to be cured\r\nby them.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Worcester Journal_ (England), in one of its issues for 1845, had\r\nthis astounding item: \"A party from the city, being on a visit to a\r\nfriend who lived at a village about four miles distant, had occasion\r\nto go into the cottage of a poor woman, who had a child afflicted with\r\nthe hooping-cough. In reply to some inquiries as to her treatment of\r\nthe child, the mother pointed to its neck, on which was a string\r\nfastened, having nine knots tied in it. The poor woman stated that it\r\nwas the stay-lace of the child's godmother which, if applied exactly\r\nin that manner about the neck, would be sure to charm away the most\r\ntroublesome cough! Thus it may be seen that, with all the educational\r\nefforts of the present day, the monster Superstition still lurks here\r\nand there in his caves and secret places.\"[120]\r\n\r\nWe find that not only human beings but animals profited by amulets. An\r\namulet is used in the cure of a blind horse which could hardly have\r\nhelped on the cure by his faith in it. \"The root of cut Malowe hanged\r\nabout the neck driveth away blemishes of the eyen, whether it be in a\r\nman or a horse, as I, Jerome of Brunsweig, have seene myselfe. I have\r\nmyselfe done it to a blind horse that I bought for X crounes, and was\r\nsold agayn for XL crounes.\"[121] That was a trick worth knowing.\r\n\r\nBrockett tells us that \"Holy-stones, or _holed-stones_, are hung on\r\nthe heads of horses as a charm against Diseases--such as sweat in\r\ntheir stalls are supposed to be cured by this application.\" The\r\nefficacy of the elder also extended to animals, for a lame pig was\r\nformerly cured by boring a hole in his ear and putting a small peg\r\ninto it. We are also told that \"wood night-shade, or bitter-sweet,\r\nbeing hung about the neck of Cattell that have the Staggers, helpeth\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n  [89] T. J.

The amulet must consist of some material\r\nsubstance so as to be suspended when employed, but the charm may be a\r\nword, gesture, look, or condition, as well as a material substance,\r\nand does not need to be attached to the body. The word \"charm\" is\r\nderived from the Latin word \"carmen,\" signifying a verse in which the\r\ncharms were sometimes written, examples of which will be given later.\r\nThe medical term \"carminative,\" a comforting medicine, really means a\r\ncharm medicine, and has the same derivation.\r\n\r\nA charm has been defined as \"a form of words or letters, repeated or\r\nwritten, whereby strange things are pretended to be done, beyond the\r\nordinary power of nature.\" It can be seen, though, that this\r\ndefinition is not sufficiently comprehensive.\r\n\r\nFor ages, people have had great faith in odd numbers. They have often\r\nbeen used as charms and for medicine. Some one says: \"Some\r\nphilosophers are of opinion that all things are composed of number,\r\nprefer the odd before the other, and attribute to it a great efficacy\r\nand perfection, especially in matters of physic: wherefore it is that\r\nmany doctors prescribed always an odd pill, an odd draught, or drop to\r\nbe taken by their patients. For the perfection thereof they allege\r\nthese following numbers: as 7 Planets, 7 wonders of the World, 9\r\nMuses, 3 Graces, God is 3 in 1, &c.\" Ravenscroft, in his comedy of\r\n\"Mammamouchi or the Citizen Turned Gentleman,\" makes Trickmore as a\r\nphysician say: \"Let the number of his bleedings and purgations be odd,\r\n_numero Deus impare gaudet_\" [God delights in an odd number].\r\n\r\nNine is the number consecrated by Buddhism; three is sacred among\r\nBrahminical and Christian people. Pythagoras held that the unit or\r\nmonad is the principle and end of all. One is a good principle. Two,\r\nor the dyad, is the origin of contrasts and separation, and is an evil\r\nprinciple. Three, or the triad, is the image of the attributes of God.\r\nFour, or the tetrad, is the most perfect of numbers and the root of\r\nall things. It is holy by nature. Five, or the pentad, is everything;\r\nit stops the power of poisons, and is dreaded by evil spirits. Six is\r\na fortunate number. Seven is powerful for good or evil, and is a\r\nsacred number. Eight is the first cube, so is man four-square or\r\nperfect. Nine, as the multiple of three, is sacred. Ten, or the\r\ndecade, is the measure of all it contains, all the numerical relations\r\nand harmonies.[122]\r\n\r\nCornelius Agrippa wrote on the power of numbers, which he declares is\r\nasserted by nature herself; thus the herb called cinquefoil, or\r\nfive-leafed grass, resists poison, and bans devils by virtue of the\r\nnumber five; one leaf of it taken in wine twice a day cures the\r\nquotidian, three the tertian, four the quartan fever.[123]\r\n\r\nThe seventh son of a seventh son was supposed to be an infallible\r\nphysician as the following quotations would indicate: \"The seventh son\r\nof a seventh son is born a physician; having an intuitive knowledge of\r\nthe art of curing all disorders, and sometimes the faculty of\r\nperforming wonderful cures by touching only.\" \"Plusieurs croyent qu'en\r\nFrance, les septiemes garcons, nez de legitimes mariages, sans que la\r\nsuitte des sept ait este interrompue par la naissance d'aucune fille,\r\npeuvent aussi guerir des fievres tierces, des fievres quartes, at\r\nmesme des ecrouelles, apres avoir jeune trois ou neuf jours avant que\r\nde toucher les malades. Mais ils font trop de fond sur le nombre\r\nseptenaire, en attribuant au septieme garcon, preferablement a tous\r\nautres, une puissance qu'il y a autant de raison d'attribuer au\r\nsixieme ou au huitieme, sur le nombre de trois, et sur celuy de neuf,\r\npour ne pas s'engager dans la superstition. Joint que de trois que je\r\nconnois de ces septieme garcons il y en a deux qui ne guerissent de\r\nrien, et que le troisieme m'a avoue de bonne foy, qu'il avoit eu\r\nautrefois la reputation de guerir de quantite des maux, quoique en\r\neffet il n'ait jamais guery d'aucun. C'est pourquoy Monsieur du\r\nLaurent a grande raison de rejetter ce pretendu pouvoir, et de la\r\nmettre au rang des fables, en ce qui concerne la guerison des\r\necrouelles.\"[124]\r\n\r\nCharms were used to avert evil and counteract supposed malignant\r\ninfluences of all kinds, but it is in their connection with diseases\r\nof the body that we are chiefly interested. There is scarcely a\r\ndisease for which a charm has not been given, but it will be seen that\r\nthose which are most affected by charms are principally derangements\r\nof the nervous system, or those periodical in character--diseases, in\r\nfact, which have proved to be most easily influenced by suggestion.\r\n\r\nCharms might be of the most varied composition. The material was\r\nselected from the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom, and might\r\nconsist of anything to which any magical property was considered to\r\nbelong. Rags, old clothes, pins, and needles were frequently employed\r\nin this way. Sir Walter Scott had in his possession a pretended charm\r\ntaken from an old woman who was said to charm and injure her\r\nneighbor's cattle. It consisted of feathers, parings of nails, hair,\r\nand similar material, wrapped in a lump of clay.\r\n\r\nThe theory of _similia similibus curantur_ seems to have entered into\r\nmediaeval medicine, and especially into the manufacture of charms. The\r\nfollowing prescriptions are examples: \"The skin of a Raven's heel is\r\ngood against gout, but the right heel skin must be laid upon the right\r\nfoot if that be gouty, and the left upon the left.... If you would\r\nhave man become bold or impudent let him carry about with him the skin\r\nor eyes of a Lion or Cock, and he will be fearless of his enemies,\r\nnay, he will be very terrible unto them. If you would have him\r\ntalkative, give him tongues, and seek out those of water frogs and\r\nducks and such creatures notorious for their continuall noise\r\nmaking.\"[125]\r\n\r\nKing also tells us that \"Hartes fete, Does Fete, Bulles fete, or any\r\nruder beastes fete should ofte be eaten; the same confort the sinewes.\r\nThe elder these beastes be, the more they strengthen.\" It is\r\nnoticeable that not age but youth is now honored, and to-day only\r\ncalves' feet are accorded medicinal value.\r\n\r\nFort[126] gives the following account of the origin of cabbalism:\r\n\"Towards the close of the fourth century an unknown scholiast\r\ncollected the exegetical elucidations, explanations and\r\ninterpretations produced by the Gemara, and united them to the Mishna,\r\nas a commentary out of which arose the Talmud. The word 'cabbala,'\r\nwhose original significance was used in the sense of reception, or\r\ntransmission, obtained at a later period the meaning of secret lore,\r\nbecause the metaphysical and theosophic idealities which had been\r\ndeveloped in the Rabbinical schools, were communicated only to a few,\r\nand consequently remained the undisputed property of a limited and\r\nclose organization.\" From this there developed a varied and\r\ncomplicated system of words and numbers which showed their power in\r\nall forms of magical marvels. Not the least common or puissant of\r\nthese was the healing of the sick.\r\n\r\nKnots were sometimes used as charms, and Cockayne gives us an example\r\nin the preface of _Saxon Leechdoms_: \"As soon as a man gets pain in\r\nhis eyes, tie in unwrought flax as many knots as there are letters in\r\nhis name, pronouncing them as you go, and tie it round his neck.\"\r\n\r\nLong before and long after New Testament days when Jesus used spittle\r\non the blind, and the time when Vespasian healed the blind by the same\r\nmeans, spittle was considered a most efficacious remedy for various\r\ndiseases. Levinus Lemnius tells us: \"Divers experiments shew what\r\npower and quality there is in Man's fasting Spittle, when he hath\r\nneither eat nor drunk before the use of it: for it cures all tetters,\r\nitch, scabs, pushes, and creeping sores: and if venomous little beasts\r\nhave fastened on any part of the body, as hornets, beetles, toads,\r\nspiders, and such like, that by their venome cause tumours and great\r\npains and inflammations, do but rub the place with fasting Spittle,\r\nand all those effects will be gone and dispersed. Since the qualities\r\nand effects of Spittle come from the humours, (for out of them is it\r\ndrawn by the faculty of Nature, as Fire draws distilled Water from\r\nhearbs) the reason may be easily understood why Spittle should do such\r\nstrange things, and destroy some creatures.\"[127]\r\n\r\nIn _Saxon Leechdoms_ a cure for gout runs thus: \"Before getting out of\r\nbed in the morning, spit on your hand, rub all your sinuews, and say,\r\n'Flee, gout, flee,' etc.\" Sir Thomas Browne, however, is not quite\r\nsure that fasting spittle really is poisonous to snakes and vipers.\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles tells us that even Galen did homage to\r\nincantations, and quotes him as saying: \"Some think that incantations\r\nare like old wives' tales; as I did for a long while. But at last I\r\nwas convinced that there is virtue in them by plain proofs before my\r\neyes. For I had trial of their beneficial operations in the case of\r\nthose scorpion-stung, nor less in the case of bones stuck fast in the\r\nthroat, immediately, by an incantation thrown up. And many of them are\r\nexcellent, severally, and they reach their mark.\"\r\n\r\nEven before our day, however, there were some sceptics. Andrews,\r\nquoting Reginald Scot, says: \"The Stories which our facetious author\r\nrelates of ridiculous Charms which, by the help of credulity, operated\r\nWonders, are extremely laughable. In one of them a poor Woman is\r\ncommemorated who cured all diseases by muttering a certain form of\r\nWords over the party afflicted; for which service she always received\r\none penny and a loaf of bread. At length, terrified by menaces of\r\nflames both in this world and the next, she owned that her whole\r\nconjuration consisted in these potent lines, which she always repeated\r\nin a low voice near the head of her patient:\r\n\r\n 'Thy loaf in my hand,\r\n  And thy penny in my purse,\r\n  Thou art never the better--\r\n  And I am never the worse.'\"\r\n\r\nLord Northampton quite fittingly inquires: \"What godly reason can any\r\nMan alyve alledge why Mother Joane of Stowe, speaking these wordes,\r\nand neyther more nor lesse,\r\n\r\n 'Our Lord was the fyrst Man,\r\n  That ever Thorne prick'd upon:\r\n  It never blysted nor it never belted,\r\n  And I pray God, nor this not may,'\r\n\r\nshould cure either Beasts, or Men and Women from Diseases?\"[128]\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would be well for us to treat the subject of charms as we\r\nhave that of amulets, and present the different charms under the\r\nheading of the diseases which they were supposed to cure.\r\n\r\n_Ague._--Many charms were given for this disease, some of which seem\r\nto us to-day most ridiculous. Brand gives a quotation from the _Life\r\nof Nicholas Mooney_ who was a notorious highwayman, executed with\r\nothers at Bristol, in 1752. It is as follows: \"After the cart drew\r\naway, the hangman very deservedly had his head broke for attempting to\r\npull off Mooney's shoes; and a fellow had like to have been killed in\r\nmounting the gallows to take away the ropes that were left after the\r\nmalefactors were cut down. A young woman came fifteen miles for the\r\nsake of the rope from Mooney's neck, which was given to her, it being\r\nby many apprehended that the halter of an executed person will charm\r\naway the ague and perform many other cures.\"\r\n\r\nPettigrew relates that \"In Skippon's account of a 'Journey through the\r\nLow Countries,' he makes mention of the lectures of Ferrarius and his\r\nnarrative of the cure of the ague of a Spanish lieutenant, by writing\r\nthe words FEBRA FUGE, and cutting off a letter from the paper every\r\nday, and he observed the distemper to abate accordingly; when he cut\r\nthe letter F last of all the ague left him. In the same year, he says,\r\nfifty more were reported to be cured in the same manner.\"\r\n\r\nAnother charm for ague was only effective when said up the chimney on\r\nSt. Agnes Eve, by the eldest female of the family. It was as follows:\r\n\r\n \"Tremble and go!\r\n    First day shiver and burn.\r\n  Tremble and quake!\r\n    Second day shiver and learn:\r\n  Tremble and die!\r\n    Third day never return.\"[129]\r\n\r\nPliny said: \"Any plant gathered from the bank of a brook or river\r\nbefore sunrise, provided that no one sees the person who gathers it,\r\nis considered as a remedy for tertian ague.\" Lodge, in glancing at the\r\nsuperstitious creed with respect to charms, says: \"Bring him but a\r\nTable of Lead, with Crosses (and 'Adonai,' or 'Elohim,' written in\r\nit), and he thinks it will heal his ague.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Marsden, while among the Sumatrans, accidentally met with the\r\nfollowing charm for the ague: \"(Sign of the cross.) When Christ saw\r\nthe cross he trembled and shaked and they said unto him, hast thou\r\nague? and he said unto them, I have neither ague nor fever; and\r\nwhosoever bears these words, either in writing or in mind, shall never\r\nbe troubled with ague or fever. So help thy servants, O Lord, who put\r\ntheir trust in thee!\"\r\n\r\nFrom Douce's notes, Mr. Brand informs us that it was usual with many\r\npersons about Exeter who had ague \"to visit at dead of night the\r\nnearest cross road five different times, and there bury a new-laid\r\negg. The visit is paid about an hour before the cold fit is expected;\r\nand they are persuaded that with the Egg they shall bury the Ague. If\r\nthe experiment fail, (and the agitation it occasions may often render\r\nit successful) they attribute it to some unlucky accident that may\r\nhave befallen them on the way. In the execution of this matter they\r\nobserve the strictest silence, taking care not to speak to anyone,\r\nwhom they may happen to meet. I shall here note another Remedy against\r\nthe Ague mentioned as above, viz., by breaking a salted Cake of Bran\r\nand giving it to a Dog, when the fit comes on, by which means they\r\nsuppose the malady to be transferred from them to the Animal.\"[130]\r\nThis and similar methods were designated transplantation.\r\n\r\n_Bites of Venomous Animals._--It is an old medical superstition that\r\nevery animal whose bite is poisonous carries the cure within itself,\r\nbut external charms were also used. It was thought that the poison of\r\nthe Spanish fly existed in the body, while the head and wings\r\ncontained the antidote. \"A hair of the dog that bites you\" is the cure\r\nfor hydrophobia, the fat of the viper was the remedy for its bite, and\r\n\"three scruples of the ashes of the witch, when she had been well and\r\ncarefully burnt at a stake, is a sure catholicon against all the evil\r\neffects of witchcraft.\"[131]\r\n\r\nSerpents' bites, which were always considered very dangerous, were\r\nsaid to be healed by people called sauveurs, who had a mark of St.\r\nCatharine's wheel upon their palates. Snake stones, originally brought\r\nfrom Java, were supposed to absorb the poison by being simply placed\r\nover the bite. Russel mentions a charm against mosquitoes, used in\r\nAleppo. It consisted of certain unintelligible characters inscribed on\r\na little slip of paper, which was pasted over the windows or upon the\r\nlintel of the door. One family has obtained, through heredity, the\r\npower of making these charms, and they distribute them on a certain\r\nday of the year without remuneration.\r\n\r\nNavarette was told that the best remedy against scorpions was to make\r\na commemoration of St. George when going to bed. This, he says, never\r\nfailed, but he also rubbed the bed with garlic. The following is given\r\nas a cure for the sting of the scorpion: \"The patient is to sit on an\r\nass, with his face to the tail of the animal, by which the pain will\r\nbe transmitted from the man to the beast.\" Or again, a person who was\r\nbitten by either a tarantulla or a mad dog must go nine times round\r\nthe town on the Sabbath, calling upon and imploring the assistance of\r\nthe saint. On the third night--the prayers being heard and granted,\r\nand the health restored--the madness was removed. The prayer was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n \"Thou who presidest over the Apulian shores,\r\n  Thou who curest the bites of mad dogs,\r\n  Thou, O Sacred One, ward off this cruel plague,\r\n  This dismal gnawing of dogs.\r\n  Get thee far hence, O madness, O fury.\"[132]\r\n\r\n_Burns._--The following is \"A Charme for a burning\":\r\n\r\n \"There came three angels out of the east;\r\n  The one brought fire, the two brought frost--\r\n  Out fire; in frost;\r\n  In the name of the Father, and Son, and Holy Ghost.\r\n  --Amen.\"[133]\r\n\r\n_Childbirth._--Many superstitious practices have grown up around this\r\ncondition. In 1554, Bonner, Bishop of London, forbade \"a mydwife of\r\nhis diocese to exercise any witchecrafte, charmes, sorcerye,\r\ninvocations, or praiers, other than such as be allowable and may stand\r\nwith the lawes and ordinances of the Catholike Church.\" In 1559, the\r\nfirst year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, an inquiry was instituted\r\n\"whether you knowe any that doe use charmes, sorcery, enchauntementes,\r\ninvocations, circles, witchecraftes, southsayinge, or any lyke craftes\r\nor imaginacions invented by the devyl, and specially in the tyme of\r\nwoman's travaylle.\" Two years before this, the midwives took an oath\r\namong themselves, so Strype tells us, not to \"suffer any other bodies'\r\nchild to be set, brought, or laid before any woman delivered of child\r\nin the place of her natural child, so far forth as I can know and\r\nunderstand. Also I will not use any kind of sorcerye or incantation in\r\nthe time of the travail of any woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe eagle stone and iris were supposed to promote an easy delivery,\r\nand the sardonyx was laid _inter mammas_ to procure an easy birth; a\r\nsardonyx formerly belonged to the monastery of St. Albans to be used\r\nfor this purpose. In some countries, during childbirth, the men lie\r\nin, keep their beds, and are attended as if really sick, sometimes as\r\nlong as six weeks.[134]\r\n\r\n_Chorea._--Of all the charms against this disease, St. Vitus' dance,\r\nnone seemed so effectual as an application to the saint. In the\r\ntranslation of Naogeorgus, Barnabe Googe says:\r\n\r\n \"The nexte is VITUS sodde in oyle, before whose ymage faire\r\n  Both men and women bringing hennes for offring doe repaire:\r\n  The cause whereof I doe not know, I think, for some disease\r\n  Which he is thought to drive away from such as him doe please.\"\r\n\r\n_Colic._--This disorder was cured by a person drinking the water in\r\nwhich he had washed his feet; we might well consider the cure worse\r\nthan the disease.\r\n\r\n_Consumption._--Shaw[135] speaks of a cure for consumptive diseases\r\nused in his time in Moray. \"They pared the Nails of the Fingers and\r\nToes of the Patient, put these Parings into a Rag cut from his\r\nclothes, then waved their Hand with the Rag thrice round his head\r\ncrying _Deas soil_, after which they buried the Rag in some unknown\r\nplace.\" Dr. Baas[136] declares that natural pills of rabbit's dung\r\nwere in use on the Rhine as a cure for consumption.\r\n\r\n\"There is a disease,\" says the minister of Logierait, writing in 1795,\r\n\"called Glacach by the Highlanders, which, as it affects the chest and\r\nlungs, is evidently of a consumptive nature. It is called Macdonald's\r\ndisease, 'because there are particular tribes of Macdonalds, who were\r\nbelieved to cure it with the Charms of their touch, and the use of a\r\ncertain set of words. There must be no fee given of any kind. Their\r\nfaith in the touch of a Macdonald is very great.'\"[137]\r\n\r\n_Cramp._--Among the many charms for cramp, the following is taken from\r\n_Pepys' Diary_:[138]\r\n\r\n \"Cramp be thou faintless,\r\n  As our Lady was sinless\r\n  When she bare Jesus.\"\r\n\r\n_Demoniacal Possession._--To know when a person is possessed, try the\r\nfollowing, says King: \"Take the harte and liver of a fysshe called a\r\nPyck, and put them into a pot wyth glowynge hot coles, and hold the\r\nsame to the patient so that the smoke may entre into hym. If he is\r\npossessed he cannot abyde that smoke, but rageth and is angry.\" \"It is\r\ngood also to make a fyre in hys chamber of Juniper wood, and caste\r\ninto the fire Franckincense and S. John's wort, for the evill spirits\r\ncannot abyde thys sent, and Waxe angry, whereby may be perceived\r\nwhether a man be possessed or not.\"[139] I am afraid that possession\r\nwould be sadly common if either of these tests were applied.\r\n\r\n_Dislocation._--Among the oldest charms we have is one given by Cato\r\nthe Censor for the reduction of a dislocated limb, and passed on to us\r\nby Pettigrew.\r\n\r\n\"A dislocation may be cured by this charm. Take a reed four or five\r\nfeet long; cut it in the middle, and let two men hold the points\r\ntowards each other for insertion. While this is doing repeat these\r\nwords: _In Alio S. F. Motas vaeta, Daries Dardaries Astataries\r\nDissunapitur_. Now jerk a piece of iron upon the reeds at their\r\njuncture, and cut right and left. Bind them to the dislocation or\r\nfracture, and it will effect a cure.\"[140]\r\n\r\n_Dropsy._--Toads were formed into a powder called Pulvis AEthiopicus,\r\nthe mode of preparation being given in Bates's Pharmacopoeia. This\r\npowder was used externally, and also given internally in cases of\r\ndropsy and other diseases.\r\n\r\n_Epilepsy._--The liver of a dead athlete was a sovereign remedy\r\nagainst epilepsy in early days. In Lincolnshire a portion of a human\r\nskull taken from a grave was grated and given to epileptics as a cure\r\nfor fits, and the water in which a corpse had been washed was given to\r\na man in Glasgow for the same purpose.[141] Another remedy was also\r\nproposed: \"If a man be greved wyth the fallinge sicknesse, let him\r\ntake a he-Wolves harte and make it to pouder and use it: but if it be\r\na woman, let her take a she-Wolves harte.\"[142]\r\n\r\nJohn of Gladdesden, who was court physician from 1305-1317, spoke thus\r\nconcerning epilepsy: \"Because there are many children and others\r\nafflicted with the epilepsy, who cannot take medicines, let the\r\nfollowing experiment be tried, which I have found to be effectual,\r\nwhether the patient was a demoniac, a lunatic, or an epileptic. When\r\nthe patient and his parents have fasted three days, let them conduct\r\nhim to church. If he be of a proper age, and of his right senses, let\r\nhim confess. Then let him hear Mass on Friday, and also on Saturday.\r\nOn Sunday let a good and religious priest read over the head of the\r\npatient, in the church, the gospel which is read in September, in the\r\ntime of vintage, after the feast of the Holy Cross. After this, let\r\nthe priest write the same gospel devoutly, and let the patient wear it\r\nabout his neck, and he shall be cured. The gospel is, 'This kind goeth\r\nnot out but by prayer and fasting.'\"[143]\r\n\r\nAmong some African tribes the foot of an elk is considered a splendid\r\nremedy against epilepsy. One foot only of each animal possesses\r\nvirtue, and the way to ascertain the valuable foot is to \"knock the\r\nbeast down, when he will immediately lift up that leg which is most\r\nefficacious to scratch his ear. Then you must be ready with a sharp\r\nscymitar to lop off the medicinal limb, and you shall find an\r\ninfallible remedy against the falling sickness treasured up in his\r\nclaws.\" The American Indians and mediaeval Norwegians also considered\r\nthis a sure remedy. The person afflicted, however, must apply it to\r\nhis heart, hold it in his left hand, and rub his ear with it.[144]\r\n\r\n_Evil-eye._--Children were supposed to be most susceptible to the\r\nevil-eye. Charms and amulets were furnished against fascination in\r\ngeneral. Certain figures in bronze, coral, ivory, etc., representing a\r\nclosed hand with the thumb thrust out between the first and second\r\nfingers called the _fig_, were common. In Henry IV, Part II, Pistol\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n \"When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like\r\n  The bragging Spaniard.\"\r\n\r\n_Eye Diseases._--Among the early Germans, ambulatory female medicists\r\nwere not uncommon, and they cured largely through charms. The\r\nfollowing is a charm used for eye diseases:\r\n\r\n \"Three maidens once going\r\n  On a verdant highway;\r\n  One could cure blindness,\r\n  Another cured cataract,\r\n  Third cured inflammation;\r\n  But all cured by one means.\"[145]\r\n\r\n_Fevers._--This charm was used for fever: \"Wryt thys Wordys on a\r\nlorell lef[+]Ysmael[+]Ysmael[+] adjuro vos per Angelum ut soporetur\r\niste Homo N. and ley thys lef under hys head that he wete not therof,\r\nand let hym ete Letuse oft and drynk Ip'e seed smal grounden in a\r\nmorter, and temper yt with Ale.\"[146]\r\n\r\n\"The fever,\" says Werenfels, \"he will not drive away by medicines,\r\nbut, what is a more certain remedy, having pared his nails and tied\r\nthem to a crayfish, he will turn his back, and as Deucalion did the\r\nstones from which a new progeny of men arose, throw them behind him\r\ninto the next river.\"[147]\r\n\r\nThe \"Leech book\"[148] says that for typhus fever the patient is to\r\ndrink of a decoction of herbs over which many masses have been sung,\r\nthen say the names of the four \"gospellers\" and a charm and a prayer.\r\nAgain, a man is to write a charm in silence, and just as silently put\r\nthe words in his left breast and take care not to go in-doors with the\r\nwriting upon him, the words being EMMANUEL VERONICA. The Loseley MSS.\r\nprescribe the following for all manner of fevers: \"Take iii drops of a\r\nwoman's mylke yt norseth a knave childe, and do it in a hennes egge\r\nthat ys sedentere (or sitting), and let hym suppe it up when the evyl\r\ntakes hym.\"\r\n\r\n_Goitre._--The dew collected from the grave of the last man buried in\r\na church-yard has been used as a lotion for goitre, and a\r\ncorrespondent of _Notes and Queries_ for May 24, 1851, furnishes two\r\nremedies then in use at Withyam, Sussex. \"A common snake, held by its\r\nhead and tail, is slowly drawn by someone standing by nine times\r\nacross the front part of the neck of the person affected, the reptile\r\nbeing allowed, after every third time, to crawl about for awhile.\r\nAfterwards the snake is put alive in a bottle, which is corked\r\ntightly, and then buried in the ground. The tradition is, that as the\r\nsnake decays, the swelling vanishes. The second mode of treatment is\r\njust the same as the above, with the exception of the snake's doom. In\r\nthis case it is kidded, and its skin, sewn in a piece of silk, is worn\r\nround the diseased neck. By degrees the swelling in this case also\r\ndisappears.\"\r\n\r\n_Headache._--In Brand's day, the rope which remained after a man had\r\nbeen hanged and cut down was an object of eager competition, being\r\nregarded as of great virtue in attacks of headache, and Gross says:\r\n\"Moss growing on a human skull, if dried, powdered, and taken as\r\nsnuff, will cure the Headach.\" Loadstone was also recommended as a\r\nsovereign remedy for this malady. Pliny said that any person might be\r\nimmediately cured of the headache by the application of any plant\r\nwhich has grown on the head of a statue, provided it be folded in the\r\nshred of a garment, and tied to the part affected with a red string.\r\n\r\n_Hemorrhage._--The following charm has been used to stop bleeding at\r\nthe nose and other hemorrhages:\r\n\r\n \"In the blood of Adam Sin was taken,\r\n  In the blood of Christ it was all shaken,\r\n  And by the same blood I do the charge,\r\n  That the blood of (insert name) run no longer at large.\"\r\n\r\nPepys in his _Diary_ gives us a Latin charm of which the following is\r\na translation:\r\n\r\n \"Blood remain in Thee,\r\n  As Christ was in himself;\r\n  Blood remain in thy veins,\r\n  As Christ in his pains;\r\n  Blood remain fixed,\r\n  As Christ was on the crucifix.\"\r\n\r\nBrand, the historian of Orkney, says: \"They have a charm whereby they\r\nstop excessive bleeding in any, whatever way they come by it, whether\r\nby or without external violence. The name of the Patient being sent to\r\nthe Charmer, he saith over some words, (which I heard,) upon which the\r\nblood instantly stoppeth, though the bleeding Patient were at the\r\ngreatest distance from the Charmer. Yea, upon the saying of these\r\nwords, the blood will stop in the bleeding throats of oxen or sheep,\r\nto the astonishment of Spectators. Which account we had from the\r\nMinisters of the Country.\"\r\n\r\nBoyle says: \"Having been one summer frequently subject to bleeding at\r\nthe nose, and reduced to employ several remedies to check that\r\ndistemper; that which I found the most effectual to stanch the blood\r\nwas some moss of a dead man's skull, (sent for a present out of\r\nIreland, where it is far less rare than in most other countries,)\r\nthough it did but touch my skin, till the herb was a little warmed by\r\nit.\"[149]\r\n\r\nBrand gives \"A charme to staunch blood: Jesus that was in Bethleem born,\r\nand baptyzed was in the flumen Jordane, as stente the water at hys\r\ncomyng, so stente the blood of thys man N. thy servvaunt, thorw the\r\nvirtu of thy holy Name [+] Jesu [+] & of thy Cosyn swete Sent Jon. And\r\nsey thys charme fyve tymes with fyve Pater Nosters, in the worschep of\r\nthe fyve woundys.\"[150]\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1853,\" says Berdoe, \"I saw among the more precious drugs\r\nin the shop of a pharmaceutical chemist at Leamington a bottle\r\nlabelled in the ordinary way with the words, Moss from a Dead-Man's\r\nSkull. This has long been used, superstitiously, dried, powdered, and\r\ntaken as snuff, for headache and bleeding at the nose.\"\r\n\r\n_Herpes._--Turner[151] notices a prevalent charm among old women for\r\nthe shingles, and which is not uncommonly heard of to-day. It was to\r\nsmear on the affected part the blood from a black cat's tail.\r\nHe says that in the only case when he saw it used it caused\r\nconsiderable mischief.\r\n\r\n_Incubus._--Stones with holes through them were commonly called\r\nhag-stones, and were often attached to the key of the stable door to\r\nprevent witches riding the horses. One of these suspended at the head\r\nof the bed was celebrated for the prevention of nightmare. In the\r\n\"Leech book\"[152] we find the following: \"If a mare or hag ride a man,\r\ntake lupins, garlic, and betony, and frankincense, bind them on a fawn\r\nskin, let a man have the worts on him, and let him go into his house.\"\r\nNotice the following from Lluellin's poems:\r\n\r\n \"Some the night-mare hath prest\r\n  With that weight on their brest,\r\n    No returnes of their breath can passe,\r\n  But to us the tale is addle,\r\n  We can take off her saddle,\r\n    And turn out the night-mare to grasse.\"\r\n\r\n_Insomnia._--In the Loseley MSS. we find a receipt \"For hym that may\r\nnot slepe. Take and wryte yese wordes into leves of lether: Ismael!\r\nIsmael! adjuro te per Angelum Michaelum ut soporetur homo iste; and\r\nlay this under his bed, so yt he wot not yerof and use it allway\r\nlytell, and lytell, as he have nede yerto.\"\r\n\r\n_Jaundice._--This disease was sometimes cured by transplantation, and\r\nParacelsus gives us a method for carrying this out. Make seven or\r\nnine--it must be an odd number--cakes of the newly emitted and warm\r\nurine of the patient with the ashes of ash wood, and bury them for\r\nsome days in a dunghill.\r\n\r\nIn the journal of Dr. Edward Browne, transmitted to his father, Sir\r\nThomas Browne, we read of a magical cure for jaundice: \"Burne wood\r\nunder a leaden vessel filled with water; take the ashes of that wood,\r\nand boyle it with the patient's urine; then lay nine long heaps of the\r\nboyled ashes upon a board in a ranke, and upon every heap lay nine\r\nspears of crocus: it hath greater effects than is credible to any one\r\nthat shall barely read this receipt without experiencing.\"[153]\r\n\r\n_Madness._--The early inhabitants of Cornwall used \"to place the\r\ndisordered in mind on the brink of a square pool, filled with water\r\nfrom St. Nun's well. The patient, having no intimation of what was\r\nintended, was, by a sudden blow on the breast, tumbled into the pool,\r\nwhere he was tossed up and down by some persons of superior strength\r\ntill, being quite debilitated, his fury forsook him; he was then\r\ncarried to church, and certain masses were sung over him. A similar\r\npractice of the people of Perthshire is noticed by Sir Walter Scott in\r\n_Marmion_.\r\n\r\n \"Thence to St. Fillan's blessed well,\r\n  Whose spring can frenzied dreams dispel,\r\n  And the crazed brain restore.\"\r\n\r\n_Marasmus._--Mr. Boyle relates the case of a physician whose wan face\r\nbetokened a marasmus, and who was induced to try a method not unlike\r\nthe sympathetic cures. \"He took an egg and boiled it hard in his own\r\nwarm urine; he then with a bodkin perforated the shell in many\r\nplaces, and buried it in an ant-hill, where it was kept to be devoured\r\nby the emmets; and as they wasted the egg, he found his distemper to\r\nabate and his strength to increase, insomuch that his disease left\r\nhim.\"[154]\r\n\r\n_Rickets._--The most common method of dealing with this disease was by\r\ndrawing the children through a split tree. The tree was afterward\r\nbound up and, as it healed and grew together, the children acquired\r\nstrength; at least, so 'twas said. Sir John Cullum saw the operation\r\nperformed and says that the ash tree was selected as most preferable\r\nfor the purpose. \"It was split longitudinally about five feet: the\r\nfissure was kept open by the gardener, whilst the friend of the child,\r\nhaving first stripped him naked, passed him thrice through it, almost\r\nhead foremost. This accomplished, the tree was bound up with\r\npackthread, and as the bark healed, so it was said the child would\r\nrecover. One of the cases was of rickets, the other a rupture.\"\r\nDrawing the children through a perforated stone was also a cure for\r\nrickets, providing that two brass pins were carefully laid across each\r\nother on the top edge of this stone.[155]\r\n\r\n_Sciatica._--Sleeping on stones on a particular night was formerly\r\npractised in Cornwall to cure all forms of lameness. Boneshave was the\r\nterm used for sciatica in Exmoor, where the following charm was used\r\nfor its cure: The patient must lie on his back on the bank of a river\r\nor brook, having a straight staff lying by his side between him and\r\nthe water, and must have the following words repeated over him:\r\n\r\n \"Boneshave right,\r\n  Boneshave straight.\r\n  As the water runs by the stave\r\n  Good for Boneshave.\"[156]\r\n\r\n_Scrofula._--Scrofula, or \"king's-evil,\" was best cured by the touch\r\nof the sovereign, but, if this could not be accomplished, a naked\r\nvirgin could cure it, especially if she spit three times upon it.\r\nStroking the affected parts nine times with the hand of a dead man,\r\nparticularly of one who had suffered a violent death as a penalty of\r\nhis crime, especially if it be murder, was long practised, and was\r\nsaid to be efficacious in curing scrofula.\r\n\r\n_Sweating Sickness._--Aubrey[157] gives a selection of the favorite\r\nprescriptions in use against the sweating sickness. Among them was the\r\nfollowing: \"Another very true medicine.--For to say every day at seven\r\nparts of your body, seven paternosters, and seven Ave Marias, with one\r\nCredo at the last. Ye shall begyn at the ryght syde, under the right\r\nere, saying the '_paternoster qui es in coelis, sanctificetur nomen\r\ntuum_,' with a cross made there with your thumb, and so say the\r\npaternoster full complete, and one Ave Maria, and then under the left\r\nere, and then under the left armhole, and then under the left hole,\r\nand then the last at the heart, with one paternoster, Ave Maria with\r\none Credo; and these thus said daily, with the grace of God is there\r\nno manner drede hym.\"\r\n\r\n_Thorns._--Three metrical charms have been used for troubles of this\r\nkind. _Pepys' Diary_ records \"A charme for a thorne\":\r\n\r\n \"Jesus, that was of a Virgin Born,\r\n  Was pricked both with nail and thorn;\r\n  It neither wealed, nor belled, rankled nor boned;\r\n  In the name of Jesus no more shall this.\"\r\n\r\nAnother form of the same is this:\r\n\r\n \"Christ was of a Virgin born,\r\n  And he was pricked with a thorn;\r\n  It did neither bell, nor swell;\r\n  And I trust in Jesus this never will.\"\r\n\r\nBrand gives another thus:\r\n\r\n \"Unto the Virgin Mary our Saviour was born,\r\n  And on his head he wore the crown of thorn;\r\n  If you believe this true and mind it well,\r\n  This hurt will never fester, nor yet swell.\"[158]\r\n\r\n_Toothache._--King in his interesting article recites this cure:\r\n\"Seeth as many little green frogges sitting upon trees as thou canst\r\nget, in water: take the fat flowynge from them, and when nede is,\r\nanoynt the teth therwyth. The graye worms breathing under wood or\r\nstone, having many fete, these perced through with a bodken and then\r\nput into the toth, alayeth the payne.\"[159] A nail driven into an oak\r\ntree is reported to be a cure for this pain, and bones from a\r\nchurch-yard have from ancient times been used as charms against this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAn early idea was that toothache was caused by a worm and that henbane\r\nseed roasted would cure it. The following from \"The School of Salerne\"\r\nformulates this superstition:\r\n\r\n \"If in your teeth you hap to be tormented,\r\n  By meane some little wormes therein do breed,\r\n  Which pain (if heed be tane) may be prevented,\r\n  Be keeping cleane your teeth, when as you feede;\r\n  Burne Francomsence (a gum not evil sented),\r\n  Put Henbane unto this, and Onyon seed,\r\n  And with a tunnel to the tooth that's hollow,\r\n  Convey the smoke thereof, and ease shall follow.\"\r\n\r\nEven to-day, I suppose, druggists sell henbane seed for this purpose.\r\nThe seed is used by sprinkling it on hot cinders and holding the open\r\nmouth over the rising smoke. The heat causes the seed to sprout, and\r\nthus there appears something similar to a maggot, which is ignorantly\r\nsupposed by the sufferer to have dropped from the tooth.[160]\r\n\r\n_Warts._--The cures for warts are many and varied. There have been\r\nmany charms devised for their removal. Grose gives directions to\r\n\"Steal a piece of beef from a butcher's shop, and rub your wart with\r\nit, then throw it down the necessary house, or bury it, and as the\r\nbeef rots, your warts will decay.\"[161] Some have great faith in\r\nhaving a vagrant count them, mark the number on the inside of his hat,\r\nand then when he leaves the neighborhood he takes the warts with him.\r\nCoffin water was also considered good for them.\r\n\r\n\"For warts,\" says Sir Thomas Browne, \"we rub our hands before the\r\nmoon, and commit any magulated part to the touch of the dead. Old\r\nWomen were always famous for curing warts; they were so in Lucian's\r\ntime.\"[162]\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm Digby, in a work already referred to, says: \"One would\r\nthink that it were folly that one should offer to wash his hands in a\r\nwell-polished silver basin, wherein there is not a drop of water, yet\r\nthis may be done by the reflection of the moonbeams only, which will\r\nafford it a competent humidity to do it; but they who have tried it,\r\nhave found their hands, after they are wiped, to be much moister than\r\nusually; but this is an infallible way to take away warts from the\r\nhands, if it be often used.\"\r\n\r\nBlack gives us several ways of charming away warts. He says:\r\n\"Lancashire wise men tell us for warts to rub them with a cinder, and\r\nthis tied up in paper, and dropped where four roads meet, will\r\ntransfer the warts to whoever opens the parcel. Another mode of\r\ntransferring warts is to touch each wart with a pebble, and place the\r\npebbles in a bag, which should be lost on the way to church; whoever\r\nfinds the bag gets the warts.\" A common Warwickshire custom was to rub\r\nthe warts with a black snail, stick the snail on a thorn bush, and\r\nthen, say the folks, as the snail dies so will the wart\r\ndisappear.[163]\r\n\r\nWarts, on the other hand, seem in certain cases to be considered\r\nlucky. In \"Syr Gyles Goosecappe, Knight,\" a play of 1606, Lord Momford\r\nis made to say: \"The Creses here are excellent good: the proportion\r\nof the chin good; the little aptnes of it to sticke out; good. And the\r\nwart aboue it most exceeding good.\"\r\n\r\n_Wen._--A newspaper of 1777 reports: \"After he (Doctor Dodd) had hung\r\nabout ten minutes, a very decently dressed young woman went up to the\r\ngallows in order to have a wen in her face stroked by the Doctor's\r\nhand; it being a received opinion among the vulgar that it is a\r\ncertain cure for such a disorder. The executioner, having untied the\r\nDoctor's hand, stroked the part affected several times therewith.\"\r\n\r\nAt the execution of Crowley, a murderer of Warwick, in 1845, a similar\r\nscene is described in the newspapers: \"At least five thousand persons\r\nof the lowest of the low were mustered on this occasion to witness the\r\ndying moments of the unhappy culprit.... As is usual in such cases (to\r\ntheir shame be it spoken) a number of females were present, and\r\nscarcely had the soul of the deceased taken its farewell flight from\r\nits earthly tabernacle, than the scaffold was crowded with members of\r\nthe 'gentler sex' afflicted with wens in the neck, with white\r\nswellings in the knees, &c., upon whose afflictions the cold clammy\r\nhand of the sufferer was passed to and fro for the benefit of his\r\nexecutioner.\"[164]\r\n\r\n_Whooping-Cough._--It was a common belief in Devonshire, Cornwall, and\r\nsome other parts of England, that if one inquired of any one riding on\r\na piebald horse of a remedy for this complaint, whatever he named was\r\nregarded as an infallible cure. In Suffolk and Norfolk, a favorite\r\nremedy was to put the head of a suffering child for a few minutes into\r\na hole made in a meadow. It must be done in the evening with only the\r\nfather and mother to witness it.\r\n\r\nA child in Cornwall received the following treatment: \"If afflicted\r\nwith the hooping cough, it is fed with the bread and butter of a\r\nfamily, the heads of which bear respectively the names of John and\r\nJoan. In the time of an epidemic, so numerous are the applications,\r\nthat the poor couple have little reason to be grateful to their\r\ngodfathers and godmothers for their gift of these particular names.\r\nOr, if a piebald horse is to be found in the neighbourhood, the child\r\nis taken to it, and passed thrice under the belly of the animal; the\r\nmere possession of such a beast confers the power of curing the\r\ndisease.\"\r\n\r\nWe have an account of a cure for whooping-cough in a Monmouthshire\r\npaper about the middle of the nineteenth century. \"A few days since an\r\nunusual circumstance was observed at Pillgwenlly, which caused no\r\nsmall degree of astonishment to one or two enlightened beholders. A\r\npatient ass stood near a house, and a family of not much more rational\r\nanimals was grouped around it. A father was passing his little son\r\nunder the donkey, and lifting him over its back a certain number of\r\ntimes, with as much solemnity and precision as if engaged in the\r\nperformance of a sacred duty. This done, the father took a piece of\r\nbread, cut from an untasted loaf, which he offered the animal to bite\r\nat. Nothing loath, the Jerusalem poney laid hold of the piece of bread\r\nwith his teeth, and instantly the father severed the outer portion of\r\nthe slice from that in the donkey's mouth. He next clipped off some\r\nhairs from the neck of the animal, which he cut up into minute\r\nparticles, and then mixed them with the bread which he had crumbled.\r\nThis very tasty food was then offered to the boy who had been passed\r\nround the donkey so mysteriously, and the little fellow having eaten\r\nthereof, the donkey was removed by his owners. The father, his son,\r\nand other members of his family were moving off, when a bystander\r\ninquired what all these 'goings on' had been adopted for? The father\r\nstared at the ignorance of the inquirer, and then in a half\r\ncontemptuous, half condescending tone, informed him that 'it was to\r\ncure his poor son's whooping-cough, to be sure!' Extraordinary as this\r\nmay appear, in days when the schoolmaster is so much in request, it is\r\nnevertheless true.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a belief in Cheshire that, if a toad is held for a moment\r\nwithin the mouth of the patient, it is apt to catch the disease, and\r\nso cure the person suffering from it. A correspondent of _Notes and\r\nQueries_ speaks of a case in which such a phenomenon actually\r\noccurred; but the experiment is one which would not be very willingly\r\ntried.

The royal touch was\r\nespecially efficacious in epilepsy and scrofula, the latter being\r\nconsequently known as \"king's-evil.\" So far as we are able to trace\r\nthis practice in history, it began with Edward the Confessor in\r\nEngland and St. Louis in France. There has been not a little dispute\r\nconcerning its real origin. \"Laurentius, first physician to Henry IV,\r\nof France, who is indignant at the attempt made to derive its origin\r\nfrom Edward the Confessor, asserts the power to have commenced with\r\nClovis I, A. D. 481, and says that Louis I, A. D. 814, added to the\r\nceremonial of touching, the sign of the cross. Mezeray also says, that\r\nSt. Louis, through humility, first added the sign of the cross in\r\ntouching for the king's evil.\"[167]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KING'S TOUCH-PIECES]\r\n\r\nWilliam of Malmesbury gives the origin of the royal touch in his\r\naccount of the miracles of Edward the Confessor. \"A young woman had\r\nmarried a husband of her own age, but having no issue by the union,\r\nthe humours collecting abundantly about her neck, she had contracted a\r\nsore disorder, the glands swelling in a dreadful manner. Admonished in\r\na dream to have the part affected washed by the king, she entered the\r\npalace, and the king himself fulfilled this labour of love, by rubbing\r\nthe woman's neck with his fingers dipped in water. Joyous health\r\nfollowed his healing hand; the lurid skin opened, so that worms flowed\r\nout with the purulent matter, and the tumour subsided. But as the\r\norifice of the ulcers was large and unsightly, he commanded her to be\r\nsupported at the royal expense until she should be perfectly cured.\r\nHowever, before a week had expired, a fair new skin returned, and hid\r\nthe scars so completely, that nothing of the original wound could be\r\ndiscovered; and within a year becoming the mother of twins, she\r\nincreased the admiration of Edward's holiness. Those who knew him more\r\nintimately, affirm that he often cured this complaint in Normandy;\r\nwhence appears how false is the notion, who in our times assert, that\r\nthe cure of this disease does not proceed from personal sanctity, but\r\nfrom hereditary virtue in the royal line.\"[168] The fact that Edward\r\nwas a saint as well as a king throws some light on the subject, for\r\nmany miracles were attributed to him. Jeremy Collier maintained that\r\nthe scrofula miracle is hereditary upon all his successors, but we\r\nfind that not blood but royal prestige was the secret. He said \"that\r\nthis prince cured the king's evil is beyond dispute: and since the\r\ncredit of this miracle is unquestionable, I see no reason why we\r\nshould scruple believing the rest.... King Edward the Confessor was\r\nthe first that cured this distemper, and from him it has descended as\r\nan hereditary miracle upon all his successors. To dispute the matter\r\nof fact, is to go to the excesses of skepticism, to deny our senses,\r\nand be incredulous even to ridiculousness.\"[169]\r\n\r\nThe quotation given above from William of Malmesbury is the earliest\r\nmention of the gift of healing by the royal touch. No historian at or\r\nnear the time of Edward has alluded to the supposed power vested in\r\nhim. Not even the bull of Pope Alexander III, by which Edward was\r\ncanonized about two centuries after his decease, makes any allusion\r\nwhatever to the cures effected by him through the imposition of hands.\r\n\r\nEnglish and French writers have disagreed not only regarding the\r\norigin, but also regarding the real possession of the power, the\r\nEnglish denying it to the French kings and the French with equal vigor\r\nrestricting it to their own sovereigns. There seems to be little doubt\r\nthat the sovereigns of both nations made cures, but the healing was\r\nconfined to these two royal families; the intermarriages in the two\r\nfamilies probably account for the belief in the transmission of the\r\ngift, regardless of the origin.\r\n\r\nThe ability to heal certain diseases passed down from reign to reign\r\nnotwithstanding the religious belief, the character, or the legitimate\r\nsuccession of the sovereign, to the time of Queen Anne. It must not be\r\nsupposed that the practice was continuous for the seven centuries from\r\nEdward the Confessor to Anne: we have no record whatever of the first\r\nfour Norman kings attempting to cure any one by the imposition of\r\nhands, and we know that William III refused to attempt healing. Andrew\r\nBoorde defines king's-evil as an \"euyl sickenes or impediment,\" and\r\nadvises as follows: \"For this matter let euery man make frendes to the\r\nKynges maiestie, for it doth pertayne to a Kynge to helpe this\r\ninfirmitie by the grace the whiche is geuen to a Kynge anoynted.\" In\r\nhis _Introduction to Knowledge_ (1547-1548) he continues: \"The Kynges\r\nof England by the power that God hath gyuen to them, dothe make sicke\r\nmen whole of a sickeness called the kynges euyll.\"[170]\r\n\r\nThere is a curious passage in Aubrey in which he says: \"The curing of\r\nthe King's Evil by the touch of the king, does much puzzle our\r\nphilosophers, for whether our kings were of the house of York or\r\nLancaster, it did the cure for the most part.\" Sir John Fortescue, in\r\ndefending the House of Lancaster against the House of York, claimed\r\nthat the crown could not descend to a female because the Queen was not\r\nqualified by the form of anointing her to cure the disease called the\r\nking's-evil. It must have been very comforting to all concerned to find\r\nthat the power to cure disease by the royal touch had not been affected\r\nby the change of sex of the reigning sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe gift was not impaired by the Reformation, and an obdurate Roman\r\nCatholic was converted on finding that Elizabeth, after the Pope's\r\nexcommunication, could cure his scrofula. Elizabeth, however, could\r\nnot bring herself fully to accept the reality of these cures. She\r\ncontinued the practice on account of the pressure of public opinion,\r\nbut upon one occasion she told a multitude of afflicted ones who had\r\napplied to her for relief, \"God alone can cure your diseases.\" Dr.\r\nTooker, the Queen's chaplain, though, certified freely to his own\r\nknowledge of the cures wrought by her, as did also William Cowles, the\r\nQueen's surgeon. Robert Laneham's letter, concerning the Queen's visit\r\nto Kenilworth Castle, relates how, on July 18, 1575, her Majesty\r\ntouched for the evil, and that it was a \"day of grace.\" \"By her\r\nhighnes accustumed mercy and charitee, nyne cured of the peynfull and\r\ndaungerous diseaz, called the king's euill; for that Kings and Queenz\r\nof this Realm withoout oother medsin (saue only by handling and\r\nprayerz) only doo cure it.\"\r\n\r\nJames I wished to drop it as a worn-out superstition, but was warned\r\nby his advisers that to do so would be to abate a prerogative of the\r\ncrown; the practice therefore continued, and good testimony exists as\r\nto the cures wrought by him. The following is an extract from a letter\r\nfrom John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton, ambassador at The Hague,\r\ndated London, 14th November, 1618: \"The Turkish Chiaus is shortly\r\ncoming for the Hagh. On Tuesday last he took leave of the king, and\r\nthanked his majesty for healing his sonne of the kinges evill; which\r\nhis majesty performed with all solemnity at Whitehall on Thursday was\r\nsevenight.\" Charles I also enjoyed the same power, notwithstanding\r\nthe public declaration by Parliament \"to inform the people of the\r\nsuperstition of being touched by the king for the evil.\" When a\r\nprisoner he cured a man by simply saying, \"God bless thee and grant\r\nthee thy desire,\" the Puritans not permitting him to touch the\r\npatient. Whereupon it is asserted by Dr. John Nicholas on his own\r\nknowledge, the blotches and humors disappeared from the patient's body\r\nand appeared in the bottle of medicine which he held in his hand.\r\nCharles's blood had the same efficacy. This sovereign substituted in\r\nsome cases the giving of a piece of silver instead of the gold, which\r\nwas usually presented to the patient. Badger says that this king\r\n\"excelled all his predecessors in the divine gift; for it is manifest\r\nbeyond all contradiction, that he not only cured by his sacred touch,\r\nboth with and without gold, but likewise perfectly effected the same\r\ncure by his prayer and benediction only.\" In his reign the gift was\r\nexercised at certain seasons of the year, Easter and Michaelmas being\r\nat first set apart for this purpose. A further regulation, which is\r\nquite suggestive, was that the patient must present a certificate to\r\nthe effect that he had never before been touched for the disease.\r\n\r\nThe following incident is related concerning Charles I: \"A young\r\ngentlewoman of about sixteen years of age, Elizabeth Stevens, of\r\nWinchester, came (7 October, 1648) into the presence-chamber to be\r\ntouched for the evill, which she was supposed to have; and therewith\r\none of her eyes (that namely on the left side) was so much indisposed,\r\nthat by her owne and her mother's testimony (who was then also\r\npresent), she had not seene with that eye of above a month before.\r\nAfter prayers, read by Dr. Sanderson, the maide kneeled downe among\r\nothers, likewise to be touched. And his majestie touched her, and put\r\na ribbon, with a piece of money at it, in usuall manner, about her\r\nneck. Which done, his majesty turned to the lords (viz., the duke of\r\nRichmond, the earl of Southampton, and the earl of Lindsey) to\r\ndiscourse with them. And the said young gentlewoman of her own accord\r\nsaid openly: 'Now, God be praised! I can see of this fore eye.' And\r\nafterwards declared she did see more and more by it, & could, by\r\ndegrees, endure the light of the candle. All which his majestie, in\r\nthe presence of the said lords & many others, examined himself, &\r\nfound to be true. And it hath since been discovered that, some months\r\nagone, the said young gentlewoman professed that, as soon as she was\r\ncome of age sufficient, she would convey over to the king's use all\r\nher land; which to the valew of about L130 _per annum_, her father\r\ndeceased had left her sole heyre unto.\"[171]\r\n\r\nCharles II, perhaps the most unworthy of English monarchs, was by far\r\nthe busiest healer, and even while in exile in the Netherlands he\r\nretained the power to cure. In one month he touched two hundred and\r\nsixty at Breda, and Lower said: \"It was not without success, since it\r\nwas the experience that drew thither every day a great number of those\r\ndiseased even from the most remote provinces of Germany.\" An official\r\nregister of the persons touched was kept for every month in his reign,\r\nbut about two and a half years appear to be wanting. The smallest\r\nnumber he touched in one year was 2,983; that was in 1669. In 1682 he\r\ntouched 8,500 persons. In 1684 the throng was such that six or seven\r\nof the sick were trampled to death. The total number touched in his\r\nreign was 92,107.[172] It is instructive to note, however, that while\r\nin no other reign were so many people touched for scrofula and so many\r\ncures vouched for, in no other reign did so many people die of that\r\ndisease.[173]\r\n\r\nJohn Browne, surgeon in ordinary to his majesty and to St. Thomas's\r\nHospital, and author of many learned works on surgery and anatomy,\r\npublished accounts of sixty cures due to this monarch. He says a\r\nsurgeon attested the reality of the disease before the miracle was\r\nperformed, to exclude impostors who were seeking the gold, for, in\r\naddition to the regular formula, the king hung about the neck of the\r\nperson touched a ribbon to which was attached a gold coin.\r\nNotwithstanding these stringent measures, some were able to impose on\r\nthe king, for the coins were often found in the shops, having been\r\nsold by the recipients. Says Brand: \"Barrington tells us of an old man\r\nwho was a witness in a cause, and averred that when Queen Anne was at\r\nOxford, she touched him whilst a child for the evil. Barrington, when\r\nhe had finished his evidence, 'asked him whether he was really cured?\r\nupon which he answered with a significant smile, that he believed\r\nhimself never to have had a complaint that deserved to be considered\r\nas the Evil, but that his parents were poor, and had no objection to\r\nthe bit of gold.'\"[174]\r\n\r\nWhile it was not unknown before, the presentation of a piece of gold\r\nwas first generally introduced in the reign of Henry VII. It probably\r\ndescended from a practice common in the time of Edward III, whose\r\ncoin, the rose-noble, is said to have been worn as an amulet to\r\npreserve from danger in battle. The angel-noble of Henry VII, valued\r\nat ten shillings, appears to have been the coin given; it was in\r\ncommon use and not made especially for this purpose. It had the figure\r\nof the Archangel Michael on one side and a ship in full sail on the\r\nother. Before hanging it on the patient's neck the monarch always\r\ncrossed the sore with it. The outlay for gold coins presented to the\r\nafflicted on these occasions rose in some years as high as L10,000. So\r\ngreat was the expense that after the reign of Elizabeth the size of\r\nthe coin was reduced. Touching pieces of the time of Charles II are\r\nnot rare even now.\r\n\r\nIn 1684 Surgeon John Browne published a curious work entitled\r\n_Adenochoiradelogia: or an Anatomick-Chirurgical Treatise on Glandules\r\nand Strumaes, or King's Evil Swellings_. In this the author traces the\r\ngift of healing from our Saviour to the apostles, and thence by a\r\ncontinuous line of Christian kings and governors, and holy men,\r\ncommencing with Edward the Confessor, whom he regards as the first\r\ncurer of scrofula by contact or imposition of hands. After referring\r\nto his majesty in most flattering terms, he continues concerning \"the\r\nadmirable effects and wonderful events of his royal cure throughout\r\nall nations, where not only English, Dutch, Scotch, and Irish have\r\nreaped ease and cure, but French, Germans, and all countreyes\r\nwhatsoever, far and near, have abundantly seen and received the same:\r\nand none ever, hitherto, I am certain, mist thereof, unless their\r\nlittle faith and incredulity starved their merits, or they received\r\nhis gracious hand for curing another disease, which was not really\r\nevermore allowed to be cured by him; and as bright evidences hereof, I\r\nhave presumed to offer that some have immediately upon the very touch\r\nbeen cured; others not so easily quitted from their swellings till the\r\nfavor of a second repetition thereof. Some also, losing their gold,\r\ntheir diseases have seized them afresh, and no sooner have these\r\nobtained a second touch, and new gold, but their diseases have been\r\nseen to vanish, as being afraid of his majesties presence; wherein\r\nalso have been cured many without gold; and this may contradict such\r\nwho must needs have the king give them gold as well as his touch,\r\nsupposing one invalid without the gift of both. Others seem also as\r\nready for a second change of gold as a second touch, whereas their\r\nfirst being newly strung upon white riband, may work as well (by their\r\nfavour). The tying the Almighty to set times and particular days is\r\nalso another great fault of those who can by no means be brought to\r\nbelieve but at Good Friday and the like seasons this healing faculty\r\nis of more vigour and efficacy than at any other time, although\r\nperformed by the same hand. As to the giving of gold, this only shows\r\nhis majesties royal well-wishes towards the recovery of those who come\r\nthus to be healed.\"[175] He refers to some \"Atheists, Sadducees, and\r\nill-conditioned Pharisees\" who disbelieved, and he gives the letter of\r\none who went, a complete sceptic, to satisfy his friends, and came\r\naway cured and converted.\r\n\r\nBrowne includes the following case which seems to him conclusive: \"A\r\nNonconformist child, in Norfolk, being troubled with scrofulous\r\nswellings, the late deceased Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, being\r\nconsulted about the same, his majesty being then at Breda or Bruges,\r\nhe advised the parents of the child to have it carried over to the\r\nking (his own method being used ineffectively); the father seemed very\r\nstrange at this advice, and utterly denied it, saying the touch of the\r\nking was of no greater efficacy than any other man's. The mother of\r\nthe child, adhering to the doctor's advice, studied all imaginable\r\nmeans to have it over, and at last prevailed with her husband to let\r\nit change the air for three weeks or a month; this being granted, the\r\nfriends of the child that went with it, unknown to the father, carried\r\nit to Breda, where the king touched it, and she returned home\r\nperfectly healed. The child being come to its father's house, and he\r\nfinding so great an alteration, inquires how his daughter arrived at\r\nthis health. The friends thereof assured him, that if he would not be\r\nangry with them, they would relate the whole truth; they, having his\r\npromise for the same, assured him they had the child to be touched at\r\nBreda, whereby they apparently let him see the great benefit his child\r\nreceived thereby. Hereupon the father became so amazed that he threw\r\noff his Nonconformity, and expressed his thanks in this manner:\r\n'Farewell to all dissenters, and to all nonconformists; if God\r\ncan put so much virtue into the king's hand as to heal my child,\r\nI'll serve that God and that king so long as I live, with all\r\nthankfulness.'\"[176] It is unfortunate that we have a change of air\r\nand food to consider in this case, else we might have a good example\r\nof a real miracle.\r\n\r\nFriday was usually set apart in this reign as the regular day for\r\nhealing, but, in addition to this, special portions of the church year\r\nwere reserved for the exercise of this gift. Very careful examinations\r\nwere made by the surgeons, and those who were found to be suffering\r\nfrom the evil were presented with a ticket by the surgeon which\r\nentitled them to receive the healing touch of the king. If the king's\r\ntouch were really efficacious, one might think that the disease should\r\nhave been wholly exterminated during this reign, so great were the\r\nnumber touched. On the contrary, the deaths were more numerous, and on\r\naccount of the neglect of medical and surgical means it spread very\r\nwidely.\r\n\r\nJames II, it is said by Dr. Heylin, also wrought cures upon babes in\r\ntheir mothers' arms, and the fame of these cures was so great that the\r\nyear before James was dethroned, a pauper of Portsmouth, New\r\nHampshire, petitioned the general assembly to enable him to make the\r\nvoyage to England to be healed by the royal touch. In one of his\r\nprogresses James touched eight hundred persons in Chester Cathedral.\r\n\r\nWilliam III evidently thought of the matter as a superstition, and on\r\none occasion he touched a patient, saying to him, \"God give you better\r\nhealth and more sense\"; notwithstanding the incredulity of the\r\nsovereign, Whiston assures us that the person was healed. With honest\r\ngood sense, however, William refused to exercise the power which most\r\nof his subjects undoubtedly thought he possessed, and many protests\r\nwere made, and much proof was adduced concerning \"the balsamic virtues\r\nof the royal hand.\" This refusal to continue the practice of touching\r\nbrought upon him the charge of cruelty from the parents of scrofulous\r\nchildren, while bigots lifted up their hands and eyes in holy horror\r\nat his impiety.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel Johnson was one of the last persons to receive the\r\nimposition of royal hands; when a boy of four and a half years, he was\r\ntouched by Queen Anne, together with about two hundred others, on\r\nMarch 30, 1712. In his case at least the touch was inefficacious, for\r\nhe was subject to scrofula all his life. Boswell says:[177] \"His\r\nmother, yielding to the superstitious notion, which, it is wonderful\r\nto think, prevailed so long in this country, as to the virtue of the\r\nroyal touch; a notion which our kings encouraged, and to which a man\r\nof such inquiry and such judgment as Carte could give credit, carried\r\nhim to London, where he was actually touched by Queen Anne. Mrs.\r\nJohnson, indeed, as Mr. Hector informed me, acted by the advice of the\r\ncelebrated Sir John Floyer, then a physician in Litchfield.\" At this\r\ntime few persons but Jacobites believed in king's touch as a miracle.\r\nDr. Daniel Turner, though, relates that several cases of scrofula\r\nwhich had been unsuccessfully treated by himself and Dr. Charles\r\nBernard, sergeant-surgeon to her majesty, yielded afterwards to the\r\nefficacy of the queen's touch.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Anne the sceptics outnumbered the believers and at\r\nher death the practice was discontinued. Among the unbelievers was the\r\nabove-mentioned Dr. Charles Bernard, an account of whose conversion is\r\ngiven by Oldmixon as follows: \"Yesterday the queen was graciously\r\npleased to touch for the King's evil some particular persons in\r\nprivate; and three weeks after, December 19, yesterday, about twelve\r\nat noon her majesty was pleased to touch, at St. James', about twenty\r\npersons afflicted with the King's evil. The more ludicrous sort of\r\nskeptics, in this case, asked why it was not called the queen's evil,\r\nas the chief court of justice was called the Queen's Bench. But\r\nCharles Bernard, the surgeon who had made this touching the subject of\r\nhis raillery all his lifetime till he became body surgeon at court,\r\nand found it a good perquisite, solved all difficulties by telling his\r\ncompanions with a fleer '_Really one could not have thought it, if one\r\nhad not seen it_.' A friend of mine heard him say it, and knew well\r\nhis opinion of it.\"[178]\r\n\r\nIn 1745 there was an attempted revival of the practice when Prince\r\nCharles Edward exercised this prerogative of royalty.\r\n\r\nHenry VII was the first monarch to establish a particular ceremony to\r\nbe observed at the healings. He probably derived this from an old form\r\nof exorcism used for the dispossessing of evil spirits. This was\r\naltered at various times but may still be found in the prayer-book of\r\nthe reign of Queen Anne. Indeed, it was not until some time after the\r\naccession of George I that the University of Oxford ceased to reprint\r\nthe office of healing, together with the Liturgy.\r\n\r\nThe routes to be travelled by royal personages and the days on which\r\nthe miracle was to be wrought were fixed at sittings of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and the clergy of all the parish churches of the realm were\r\nsolemnly notified. They, in turn, informed the people, and the\r\nsufferers along the way had many days in which to cherish the\r\nexpectation of healing, in itself so beneficial. The ceremony was\r\nconducted with great solemnity and pomp. It has been vividly described\r\nby Macaulay as follows: \"When the appointed time came, several divines\r\nin full canonicals stood round the canopy of state. The surgeon of the\r\nroyal household introduced the sick. A passage of Mark 16. was read.\r\nWhen the words 'They shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall\r\nrecover,' had been pronounced, there was a pause and one of the sick\r\nwas brought to the king. His Majesty stroked the ulcers and swellings,\r\nand hung round the patient's neck a white ribbon to which was fastened\r\na gold coin. The other sufferers were led up in succession; and as\r\neach was touched the chaplain repeated the incantation, 'They shall\r\nlay their hands on the sick and they shall recover.' Then came the\r\nepistle, prayers, antiphonies, and a benediction.\"\r\n\r\nEvelyn, in his _Diary_, gives us the form employed by Charles II in\r\nJuly, 1660, as follows: \"His Majestie first began to touch for evil\r\naccording to costume, thus--His majestie sitting under his state in\r\nthe Banquetting House, the Chirurgeons cause the sick to be brought or\r\nled up to the throne, where they kneeling, the King strokes their\r\nfaces or cheekes with both his hands at once, at which instant a\r\nChaplaine in his formalities says: 'He put his hands on them and he\r\nhealed them.' This is sayed to every one in particular. When they have\r\nall been touched they come up againe in the same order; and the other\r\nChaplaine kneeling, and having angel-gold strung on white ribbon on\r\nhis arme, delivers them one by one to his Majestie, who puts them\r\nabout the necks of the touched as they passe, whilst the first\r\nChaplaine repeats: 'That is the true light who came into the world.'\r\nThen follows an Epistle (as at first, a Gospel) with the Liturgy,\r\nprayers for the sick with some alteration, lastly the blessing: and\r\nthe Lo. Chamberlaine and Comptroller of the Household, bring a basin,\r\newer, and towel for his Majestie to wash.\"[179]\r\n\r\nThe belief in the efficacy of the king's touch was general, and Lecky\r\ntells us its genuineness \"was asserted by the privy council, by the\r\nbishops of two religions, by the general voice of the clergy in the\r\npalmiest days of the English Church, by the University of Oxford, and\r\nby the enthusiastic assent of the people. It survived the ages of the\r\nReformation, of Bacon, of Milton, and of Hobbes. It was by no means\r\nextinct at the age of Locke, and would probably have lasted still\r\nlonger, had not the change of dynasty at the Revolution assisted the\r\ntardy scepticism.\"[180]\r\n\r\nIn France there was the same belief in the efficacy of the royal\r\ntouch. Philip I exercised the gift, but the French historians say that\r\nhe was deprived of the power on account of the irregularity of his\r\nlife. Laurentius reports that Francis I, when a prisoner in Spain,\r\ncured a great number of people of struma (scrofula). A paraphrase of\r\nthe Latin verse which Lascaris wrote concerning this event is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n \"The king applies his hand, diseases fly,\r\n  And though a captive, still the powers on high\r\n  Regard his touch. This striking proof is giv'n,\r\n  That they who bound him are the foes of Heav'n.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning the touching by the kings of France, Pettigrew says: \"In\r\nthe church of St. Maclou, in St. Denys, Heylin (_Cosmograph._, p. 184)\r\nsays the kings of France, with a fast of nine days and other penances,\r\nused to receive the gift of healing the king's evil with nothing but a\r\ntouch. Philip de Comines states, that the king always confessed before\r\nthe cure of the king's evil. Butler (_Lives of the Saints_, vol. VIII,\r\np. 394) says, 'The French kings usually only perform this ceremony on\r\nthe day they have received the holy communion.' The historians who\r\nwrite under the first two families of the French kings are altogether\r\nsilent as to the kings' curing the evil by the touching. (_Veyrard\r\nTrav._, p. 109.) Philip of Valois is reported to have cured 1400 people\r\nafflicted with the king's evil. Of Louis XIII, it was said that he had\r\nassigned all his power to Cardinal Richelieu, except that of curing\r\nthe king's evil. Carte says, some of the French writers ascribe the\r\ngift of healing to their king's devotion toward the relics of St.\r\nMarculf, in the church of Corbigny, in Champagne: to which the kings\r\nof France, immediately after their coronation at Rheims, used to go in\r\nsolemn procession. A veneration was also paid to this saint in\r\nEngland, and a room in memory of him, in the palace of Westminster,\r\nhas frequently been mentioned in the Rolls of Parliament, and which\r\nwas called the Chamber of St. Marculf, being, as Carte conjectures,\r\nprobably the place where the kings used to touch for the evil. This\r\nroom was afterward called the Painted Chamber. The French kings\r\npractised the touch extensively. Gemelli, the traveller, states, that\r\nLouis XIV touched 1600 persons on Easter Sunday, 1686.[181] The words\r\nhe used were, 'Le Roy te touche, Dieu te guerisse.' Every Frenchman\r\nreceived fifteen sous, and every foreigner thirty. The French kings\r\nkept up the practice to 1776.\"[182]\r\n\r\n\"Servetus,\" says Hammond, \"who was not of a credulous mind, says in\r\nthe first edition of his _Ptolemy_, published in 1535, that he had\r\nseen the king touch many persons for the disease, but he had never\r\nseen any that were cured thereby. But the last clause of this sentence\r\nexcited the ire of the censor, and in the next edition, published in\r\n1541, the words '_an sanati fuerint non vidi_' were changed to\r\n'_pluresque sanatos passim audivi_': 'I have heard of many that were\r\ncured.' Testimony in support of miracles has often been manufactured,\r\nbut the natural obstinacy and truthfulness of Servetus would not admit\r\nof his giving his personal endorsement at the expense of his\r\nconvictions.\"[183]\r\n\r\nWithin the last half-century we have had an example of the value of\r\nthe royal touch. When cholera was raging in Naples in 1865, and the\r\npeople were rushing from the city by thousands, King Victor Emmanuel\r\nwent the rounds of the hospitals in an endeavor to stimulate courage\r\nin the hearts of his people. He lingered at the bedside of the\r\npatients and spoke encouraging words to them. On a cot lay one man\r\nalready marked for death. The king stepped to his side, and pressing\r\nhis damp, icy hand, said, \"Take courage, poor man, and try to recover\r\nsoon.\" That evening the physicians reported a diminution of the\r\ndisease in the course of the day, and the man marked for death out of\r\ndanger. The king had unconsciously worked a marvellous cure.[184]\r\n\r\nIt seems certain that there was not the efficacy in king's touch which\r\nwas claimed for it, or it would not have been discontinued after\r\nhaving held sway for over seven hundred years. No doubt the\r\nquasi-religious character of the office of the sovereign helped much\r\nin the belief, and when such men as Charles II were able to heal,\r\nlittle connection between religion and healing could longer be thought\r\npossible, as far as the healing by king's touch was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Hallowing of Cramp Rings was not unlike the king's touch. It is\r\ndescribed by Bishop Percy in his _Northumberland Household Book_,\r\nwhere we have the following account: \"And then the Usher to lay a\r\nCarpett for the Kinge to Creepe to the Crosse upon. An that done,\r\nthere shal be a Forme sett upon the Carpett, before the Crucifix, and\r\na Cushion laid upon it for the King to kneale upon. And the Master of\r\nthe Jewell Howse ther to be ready with the Booke concerninge the\r\nHallowing of the Crampe Rings, and Amner (Almoner) muste kneele on\r\nthe right hand of the King, holdinge the sayde booke. When that is\r\ndone the King shall rise and goe to the Alter, wheare a Gent. Usher\r\nshall be redie with a Cushion for the Kinge to kneele upon; and then\r\nthe greatest Lords that shall be ther to take the Bason with the Rings\r\nand beare them after the Kinge to offer.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Harleian Manuscripts there is a letter from Lord Chancellor\r\nHatton to Sir Thomas Smith, dated September 11, 158-, about a\r\nprevailing epidemic, and enclosing a ring for Queen Elizabeth to wear\r\nbetween her breasts, the said ring having \"the virtue to expell\r\ninfectious airs.\"\r\n\r\nAndrew Boorde, already quoted, says: \"The Kynges of England doth\r\nhalowe euery yere crampe rynges, the whyche rynges, worne on ones\r\nfynger, dothe helpe them the whyche hath the crampe.\"[185] Also, \"The\r\nkynges majesty hath a great help in this matter, in hallowynge crampe\r\nrynges, and so given without money or petition.\"\r\n\r\nIn the account of the ceremony given by Hospinian, he states that \"it\r\nwas performed upon Good Friday, and that it originated from a ring\r\nwhich had been brought to King Edward by some persons from Jerusalem,\r\nand one which he himself hath long before given privately to a poor\r\npetitioner who asked alms of him for the love he bore to St. John the\r\nEvangelist. This ring was preserved with great veneration in\r\nWestminster Abbey, and whoever was touched by this relic was said to\r\nbe cured of the cramp or of the falling sickness.\" Burnet informs us\r\nthat Bishop Gardiner was at Rome in 1529, and that he wrote a letter\r\nto Ann Boleyn, by which it appears that Henry VIII blessed the cramp\r\nrings before as well as after the separation from Rome, and that she\r\nsent them as great presents thither.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stephens, I send you here cramp rings for you and Mr. Gregory and\r\nMr. Peter, praying you to distribute them as you think best.--Ann\r\nBoleyn.\"[186]\r\n\r\nThis ceremonial was practised by previous sovereigns and discontinued\r\nby Edward VI. Queen Mary intended to revive it, and, indeed, the\r\noffice for it was written out, but she does not appear to have carried\r\nher intentions into effect.\r\n\r\n  [167] T. J.

They are as old as man, yes, probably older, since we know\r\nthat some of the same phenomena apply to animals. But the claim might\r\nwell be made that while isolated facts of this kind were well known,\r\nespecially in the East, no scientific collaboration and explanation\r\nwere attempted until this time.\r\n\r\nAs with all other departments of science, we may trace a gradual\r\ndevelopment. Astrology of old taught the influence of the stars upon\r\nmen, which doctrine was accepted by the great physician Theophrastus\r\nParacelsus (1490-1541). This, however, was only part of his belief:\r\nthe human body was endowed with a double magnetism; one portion\r\nattracted to itself the planets and was nourished by them, the result\r\nof which was the mental powers; the other portion attracted and\r\ndisintegrated the elements, from which process resulted the body. He\r\nalso claimed that the magnetic virtue of healthy persons attracted the\r\nenfeebled magnetism of the sick. With this theory of animal magnetism,\r\nit was only natural that he should value the use of the magnet very\r\nhighly in the cure of diseases. This dual theory of magnetic cures,\r\nthat of the magnetic influence of men on men and of the magnet on man,\r\nwas prevalent for over a century, and found its latest exponent in\r\nMesmer.\r\n\r\nFollowing Paracelsus, Glocenius, Burgrave, Helinotius, Robert Fludd,\r\nand Kircher believed that the magnet represented the universal\r\nprinciple by which all natural phenomena might be explained. This\r\nprinciple, existing as it did in the human body, was an important\r\nfactor in health and disease. The great chemist Von Helmont\r\n(1577-1644) taught more precisely that a power resided in man by which\r\nhe could magnetically affect others, and thereby cure the sick who\r\nwere most influenced by it. He published a work on the effects of\r\nmagnetism on the human frame.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Balthazar Gracian, a Spaniard, boldly proclaimed\r\nhis views. \"The magnet,\" he said, \"attracts iron; iron is found\r\neverywhere; everything, therefore, is under the influence of\r\nmagnetism.... It is the same agent which gives rise to sympathy,\r\nantipathy, and the passions.\" Baptista Porta (1543-1615), one of the\r\noriginators of the weapon-salve, had also great faith in the magnet.\r\nSo effective was his work on the imaginations of his patients that he\r\nwas considered a magician and prohibited from practising by the court\r\nof Rome. Sebastian Wirdig, professor of medicine at the University of\r\nRostock, in Mecklenburg, wrote a treatise on \"The New Medicine of the\r\nSpirits\" which he presented to the Royal Society of London in 1673. He\r\nmaintained that a magnetic influence took place, not only between the\r\ncelestial and terrestrial bodies, but between all living things. The\r\nwhole world was under the influence of magnetism: life was preserved\r\nby magnetism, death was the consequence of magnetism.\r\n\r\nMaxwell (1581-1640) propagated somewhat the same doctrine. He was a\r\nfirm believer in sympathetic cures, and assumed a vital spirit of the\r\nuniverse which related all bodies. It was probably from this that\r\nMesmer got his idea of what he called the universal fluid. It would\r\nseem, however, that Maxwell was aware of the great influence of\r\nimagination and suggestion. He said: \"If you wish to work prodigies,\r\nabstract from the materiality of beings--increase the sum of\r\nspirituality in bodies--rouse the spirit from its slumbers. Unless you\r\ndo one or other of these things--unless you can bind the idea, you can\r\nnever perform anything good or great.\" About the same time, in Italy,\r\nSantanelli propagated the theory of a universal fluid. Everything\r\nmaterial possessed a radiating atmosphere which operated\r\nmagnetically. He also recognized, however, the great influence of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F. A. MESMER]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1771, Father Hell, a Jesuit, and professor of astronomy\r\nat the University of Vienna, became famous through his magnetic cures,\r\nand invented steel plates of a peculiar form which he applied to the\r\nnaked body as a cure for several diseases. In 1774 he communicated his\r\nsystem to Mesmer, the man who, more than any one else, drew the\r\nworld's attention to the investigation of mental healing. Various\r\nestimates have been made of Mesmer's character and he frequently has\r\nbeen condemned. He was fond of display, but it is doubtful if he was\r\nmore avaricious than most persons who lived before and have lived\r\nsince. He was evidently honest in his scientific investigations and\r\nopinions, and this is our main concern.\r\n\r\nFriederich Antony Mesmer (1733-1815) was born at Mersbury, in Swabia,\r\nand studied medicine at the University of Vienna. He read freely the\r\nbooks written by the authors already mentioned, and accepted much of\r\ntheir teaching. His originality consisted principally in applying to\r\nthe sick this universal principle, by means of contact and passes,\r\nwhile his predecessors infused the vital spirit through the use of\r\ntalismans and of magic boxes. He took his medical degree in 1766 and\r\nchose as the subject of his inaugural dissertation \"The Influence of\r\nthe Planets in the Cure of Diseases.\" In this dissertation he\r\nmaintained \"that the sun, moon, and fixed stars mutually affect each\r\nother in their orbits; that they cause and direct in our earth a flux\r\nand reflux not only in the sea, but in the atmosphere, and affect in a\r\nsimilar manner all organized bodies through the medium of a subtle and\r\nmobile fluid, which pervades the universe, and associates all things\r\ntogether in mutual intercourse and harmony.\" This influence, he said,\r\nwas particularly exercised on the nervous system, and produced two\r\nstates, which he called _intension_ and _remission_, which seemed to\r\nhim to account for the different periodical revolutions observable in\r\nseveral maladies.\r\n\r\nEight years later he met Father Hell, and after trying some\r\nexperiments with his metallic plates was astonished at his success. He\r\ncontinued working with Hell for some time, but they finally\r\nquarrelled, and shortly afterward he stumbled upon his theory of\r\nanimal magnetism. After this he no longer used the magnet in healing.\r\nThe Academy of Science at Berlin examined his claims, but their report\r\nwas far from favorable or flattering. Nevertheless, writing to a\r\nfriend from Vienna, he said: \"I have observed that the magnetic is\r\nalmost the same as the electric fluid, and that it may be propagated\r\nin the same manner, by means of intermediate bodies. Steel is not the\r\nonly substance adapted to this purpose. I have rendered paper, bread,\r\nwool, silk, stones, leather, glass, wood, men, and dogs--in short,\r\nevery thing I touched--magnetic to such a degree, that these\r\nsubstances produced the same effects as the loadstone on diseased\r\npersons. I have charged jars with magnetic matter in the same way as\r\nis done with electricity.\" About this time he was nominated a member\r\nof the Academy of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nLeaving Vienna and travelling through Swabia and Switzerland, he met\r\nGassner and witnessed some of his cures. Mesmer claimed that they were\r\nperformed by his newly discovered magnetism. He arrived in Paris in\r\n1778 and found this city more receptive to his arts. He at first\r\nestablished himself in an humble quarter of the city and began to\r\nexpound his theory. The following year he published a paper in which\r\nhe summed up his claims in twenty-seven assertions to which he rigidly\r\nheld through his life. His doctrines were well received, and acquired\r\nan impetus at the beginning by the conversion of one of the leading\r\nphysicians of the faculty of medicine, Deslon, the Comte d'Artois'\r\nfirst physician.\r\n\r\nPupils and patients now flocked to him. The crowd was so great that\r\nMesmer employed a _valet toucheur_ to magnetize in his place. This was\r\nnot sufficient; he then invented the famous _baquet_, or trough,\r\naround which thirty persons might simultaneously be magnetized. This\r\n_baquet_ is described as follows: \"A circular, oaken case, about a\r\nfoot high, was placed in the middle of a large hall, hung with thick\r\ncurtains, through which only a soft and subdued light was allowed to\r\npenetrate; this was the _baquet_. At the bottom of the case, on a\r\nlayer of powdered glass and iron filings, there lay full bottles,\r\nsymmetrically arranged, so that the necks of all converged toward the\r\ncentre; other bottles were arranged in the opposite direction, with\r\ntheir necks toward the circumference. All these objects were immersed\r\nin water, but this condition was not absolutely necessary, and the\r\n_baquet_ might be dry. The lid was pierced with a certain number of\r\nholes, whence there issued jointed and moving iron branches, which\r\nwere to be held by the patients. Absolute silence was maintained. The\r\npatients were ranged in several rows round the _baquet_, connected\r\nwith each other by cords passed round their bodies, and by a second\r\nchain, formed by joining hands.\"[187]\r\n\r\nAdditional features were provided to heighten the effect of the\r\nmagnetic charm. \"Richly stained glass shed a dim religious light on\r\nhis spacious saloons, which were almost covered with mirrors. Orange\r\nblossoms scented all the air of his corridors; incense of the most\r\nexpensive kinds burned in antique vases on his chimney-pieces; aeolian\r\nharps sighed melodious music from distant chambers; while sometimes a\r\nsweet female voice, from above or below, stole softly upon the\r\nmysterious silence that was kept in the house and insisted upon from\r\nall visitors.\"[188]\r\n\r\nBailly, the historian and celebrated astronomer, an eye-witness,\r\ndescribes the results. \"Some patients remain calm and experience\r\nnothing; others cough, spit, feel slight pain, a local or general\r\nheat, and fall into sweats; others are agitated and tormented by\r\nconvulsions. These convulsions are remarkable for their number,\r\nduration, and force, and have been known to persist for more than\r\nthree hours. They are characterized by involuntary, jerking movements\r\nin all the limbs, and in the whole body, by contraction of the throat,\r\nby twitchings in the hypochondriac and epigastric regions, by dimness\r\nand rolling of the eyes, by piercing cries, tears, hiccough, and\r\nimmoderate laughter. They are preceded or followed by a state of\r\nlanguor or dreaminess, by a species of depression, and even by stupor.\r\n\r\n\"The slightest sudden noise causes the patient to start, and it has\r\nbeen observed that he is affected by a change of time or tune in the\r\nairs performed on the pianoforte; that his agitation is increased by a\r\nmore lively movement, and that his convulsions then become more\r\nviolent. Patients are seen to be absorbed in the search for one\r\nanother, rushing together, smiling, talking affectionately, and\r\nendeavoring to modify their crises. They are all so submissive to the\r\nmagnetizer that even when they appear to be in a stupor, his voice, a\r\nglance, or a sign will rouse them from it. It is impossible not to\r\nadmit, from all these results, that some great force acts upon and\r\nmasters the patients, and that this force appears to reside in the\r\nmagnetizer. This convulsive state is termed the _crisis_. It has been\r\nobserved that many women and few men are subject to such crises; that\r\nthey are only established after the lapse of two or three hours, and\r\nthat when one is established, others soon and successively begin.\r\n\r\n\"When the agitation exceeds certain limits, the patients are\r\ntransported into a padded room; the women's corsets are unlaced, and\r\nthey may then strike their heads against the padded walls without\r\ndoing themselves any injury.\" Notwithstanding these means, thousands\r\nwere healed of their diseases.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" says Baron Dupotet, \"to conceive the sensation\r\nwhich Mesmer's experiments created in Paris. No theological\r\ncontroversy, in the earlier ages of the Catholic Church, was ever\r\nconducted with greater bitterness.\" He was called a quack, a fool, and\r\na demon, while his friends were as extravagant in his praise as his\r\nfoes in their censure. After this great excitement, his life may\r\nlargely be summed up in his challenges to different societies, the\r\nappointment of commissions, their examinations, and their reports.\r\n\r\nOn the advice of Deslon he challenged the Faculty of Medicine,\r\nproposing to select twenty-four patients, of whom twelve should be\r\ntreated according to the old and approved methods and twelve\r\nmagnetically, the cures to prove the efficacy of the treatment. The\r\nfaculty declined to accept the conditions. Deslon asked his colleagues\r\non the faculty to summon a general meeting to examine the matter.\r\nThrough the influence of M. de Vauzesmes, the meeting was very hostile\r\nto him, and he was condemned and threatened with having his name\r\nremoved from the list of licensed physicians if he did not reform.\r\n\r\nMesmer now wrote to Marie Antoinette suggesting that the government\r\nfurnish him with houses, land, and a princely fortune to enable him to\r\ncarry on his experiments untroubled. The government finally offered\r\nhim a pension of 20,000 francs, and the cross of the order of St.\r\nMichael, if he had made any discovery in medicine, and would\r\ncommunicate it to the physicians whom the king should name. Mesmer\r\nrefused the conditions and left Paris.\r\n\r\nDeslon was then called upon to renounce animal magnetism, but instead,\r\ninvited investigation. In 1784 the government appointed a commission\r\nto inquire into magnetism, consisting of members from the Faculty of\r\nMedicine and the Academy of Sciences. Franklin, Lavoisier, and Bailly\r\nwere members, the last named being chosen reporter. Another\r\ncommission, composed of members of the Royal Society of Medicine, was\r\ncharged to make a distinct report on the same subject. After\r\nexperimenting for five months the first commission presented two\r\nreports, one public and the other secret, neither of which was\r\nfavorable. The Royal Society of Medicine presented its report a few\r\ndays later, and agreed with the first commission with the exception of\r\none member, Laurent de Jussieu, who dissented and published a separate\r\nreport of a more favorable nature. The gist of the commissions'\r\nreports was that imagination, not magnetism, accounted for the\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nSoon after the commissions started their investigations, Mesmer\r\nreturned to Paris at the invitation of his friends, who proposed to\r\nopen a subscription for him for 10,000 louis. Immediately it was\r\nover-subscribed by over 140,000 francs. He came with the\r\nunderstanding that he was to give lectures and to reveal the secret of\r\nanimal magnetism. The lectures and secrets were not satisfactory.\r\nAfter the commission reported he left Paris and returned to his own\r\ncountry where he was little heard of during the remainder of his life\r\nwhich ended in 1815.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of Mesmer, there seems to be no doubt about the\r\nhonesty of his most famous pupil, the Marquis de Puysegur, and to him\r\nwe are indebted for a forward step. When Mesmer left Paris, the\r\nmarquis retired to his estate near Soissons, and employed his leisure\r\nin magnetizing peasants. He magnetized his gardener, a young man named\r\nVictor, and after experimenting upon him claimed that during the state\r\nVictor exhibited marvellous telepathic and clairvoyant phenomena.\r\nUnable to attend all the patients who applied to him, he followed\r\nMesmer's plan of magnetizing a tree. An elm on the village green was\r\nchosen, and round this patients gathered on stone benches as around\r\nMesmer's _baquet_.\r\n\r\nFollowing Mesmer's theories very closely, the contribution he made was\r\nin the recognition of the likeness between the magnetized state and\r\nthat of somnambulism, so that he designated this state \"artificial\r\nsomnambulism.\" He also modified the conditions of inducing this\r\nstate, and simple contact or spoken orders were substituted for the\r\nuse of the _baquet_. The effect was therefore milder, and instead of\r\nhysteria and violent crises accompanied by sobs, cries, and\r\ncontractions, there was peaceful slumber. He recognized the rapport\r\nbetween operator and subject, and amnesia on awaking, and other\r\nphenomena now well known, but he still held to the Mesmeric theory of\r\nthe existence of a universal fluid which saturated all bodies,\r\nespecially the human body. It was electric in nature, and man could\r\ndisplay and diffuse this electric fluid at will.\r\n\r\nWhile the Marquis de Puysegur was using the elm tree near Soissons,\r\nthe Chevalier de Barbarin was successfully magnetizing people without\r\nparaphernalia. He sat by the bedside of the sick and prayed that they\r\nmight be magnetized; his efforts were successful. He maintained that\r\nthe effect of animal magnetism was produced by the mere effort of one\r\nhuman soul acting upon another; and when the connection had once been\r\nestablished the magnetizer could communicate his influence to the\r\nsubject regardless of the distance which separated them. Numerous\r\npersons adopted this view, calling themselves Barbarinists after their\r\nleader. In Sweden and Germany they were called _spiritualists_, to\r\ndistinguish them from the followers of de Puysegur, who were called\r\n_experimentalists_.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a doctor of Lyons, Petetin, experimented with\r\nmagnetism. After his death a paper written by him was published\r\ndescribing catalepsy and sense transference. Numerous magnetic\r\nsocieties were founded in the principal cities of France. In\r\nStrasburg, the Society of Harmony, consisting of more than one hundred\r\nand fifty members, published for years the result of their work. The\r\ndisturbance incident to the Revolution and the wars of the Empire\r\nwhich followed repressed the investigations of magnetism in France for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nIn England the advent of magnetism seems to have taken place about\r\n1788. In that year one Dr. Mainandus, who had been a pupil first of\r\nMesmer and later of Deslon, arrived in Bristol and gave public\r\nlectures on the subject. People of rank and fortune soon came from\r\ndifferent cities to be magnetized or to place themselves under his\r\ntuition. He afterward established himself in London where he was\r\nequally successful in attracting and curing people. So much curiosity\r\nwas excited by the subject that, about the same time, a man named\r\nHolloway gave a course of lectures on animal magnetism in London.\r\nLarge crowds gathered to hear him at the rate of five guineas for each\r\npupil.\r\n\r\nLoutherbourg, the painter, and his wife entered upon a similar work.\r\n\"Such was the infatuation of the people to be witnesses of their\r\nstrange manipulations,\" says Mackay, \"that at times upwards of three\r\nthousand persons crowded round their house at Hammersmith, unable to\r\ngain admission. The tickets sold at prices ranging from one to three\r\nguineas.\" Loutherbourg later became a divine healer. From 1789 to 1798\r\nmagnetism attracted little or no attention in England. At the latter\r\ndate a Connecticut Yankee, Benjamin Douglas Perkins, invented\r\n\"metallic tractors.\" The Society of Friends built a hospital called\r\nthe \"Perkinean Institute\" where all comers might be magnetized free of\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nAbout 1786 animal magnetism appeared in two different places in\r\nGermany--on the upper Rhine and in Bremen. At this time Lavater paid a\r\nvisit to Bremen and exhibited the magnetizing process to several\r\ndoctors. Bremen was for a long time a focus of the new doctrine, and\r\nthereby was brought into bad repute. About the same time the doctrine\r\nspread from Strasburg over the Rhine provinces. Among those active in\r\nexperiments were Boeckmann of Carlsruhe, Gmelin of Heilbronn, and\r\nPezold of Dresden. Soon it spread all over Germany. In 1789 Selle of\r\nBerlin brought forward a series of experiments made at the Charite\r\n(Hospital), in which he confirmed some of the alleged phenomena but\r\nexcluded the supernormal.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the early dislike, animal magnetism flourished in\r\nGermany during the first twenty years of the nineteenth century. In\r\n1812 the Prussian government sent Wolfart to Mesmer at Frauenfeld, to\r\nacquaint himself with the subject. He returned to Berlin an ardent\r\nadherent of Mesmer and introduced magnetism into the hospital\r\ntreatment. From this magnetism flourished so much in Berlin that, as\r\nWurm relates, the Berlin physicians placed a monument on the grave of\r\nMesmer at Moersburg, and theological candidates received instruction in\r\nphysiology, pathology, and the treatment of sickness by vital\r\nmagnetism. The well-known physician Koreff was interested in magnetism\r\nand often made use of it for healing purposes. Magnetism was\r\nintroduced everywhere, especially in Russia and Denmark. In\r\nSwitzerland and Italy it was at first received with less sympathy, and\r\nin 1815 the exercise of magnetism was forbidden in the whole of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 the naturalist Deleuze published a book entitled _Histoire\r\ncritique du magnetisme animal_. Like his predecessors, he was chiefly\r\ninterested in the therapeutic value of magnetism, and insisted that\r\nfaith was necessary for effective treatment. On account of this\r\ncondition any demonstration was impossible. He still held to the idea\r\nof a pervading fluid and maintained that the depth of the magnetic\r\nsleep depended upon the amount of the magnetic charge. Shortly after\r\nthe appearance of Deleuze's book, interest in animal magnetism\r\nincreased, and several journals dealing exclusively with the subject\r\nwere started.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Mesmer in 1815 ended the first period in the history\r\nof the phenomena known as animal magnetism. Up to this time the\r\ngenerally accepted theory was that of a vital fluid which permeated\r\nevery thing and person and through which one person influenced\r\nanother. The second period extended from 1815-1841 when Braid\r\ndiscovered and formulated the method of operation. The third period\r\nreached from 1841-1887 during which there was careful and scientific\r\nstudy of the whole subject, and hypnotism came into repute as a\r\nhealing measure. I am inclined to posit a fourth period, 1887 to the\r\npresent time, for Myers' hypothesis of a subliminal self, or the\r\ntheory of the subconsciousness, has made a great difference in the\r\ntheory of hypnotism.\r\n\r\nThe second period began when Abbe Faria in 1814-15 came from India to\r\nParis and gave public exhibitions, publishing the results of some of\r\nhis experiments. He seated his subjects in an armchair, with eyes\r\nclosed, and then cried out in a loud commanding voice, \"Sleep.\" He\r\nused no manipulations and had no _baquet_, but he boasted of having\r\nproduced five thousand somnambulists by this method. He opined that\r\nthe state was caused by no unknown force, but rested in the subject\r\nhimself. He agreed with the present generally accepted theory that all\r\nis subjective.\r\n\r\nFollowing Faria, Bertrand and Noizet paved the way for the doctrine of\r\nsuggestion notwithstanding their inclination toward animal magnetism.\r\nExperiments were performed at the Hotel-Dieu in 1820 but later were\r\nprohibited. Through the influence of Foissac in 1826 the Academy of\r\nMedicine appointed a committee to examine the subject, and in 1831 a\r\nreport acknowledging the genuineness of the phenomena was made, and\r\ntherapeutic effects were frankly admitted. In 1837 the Academy\r\nappointed another commission to examine still further, for the members\r\nas a whole were not convinced. The report of this commission was\r\nlargely negative.\r\n\r\nAfter this the younger Burdin, a member of the Academy, proposed to\r\naward from his own purse a prize of 3,000 francs to any person who\r\ncould read a given writing without the aid of his eyes, and in the\r\ndark. The existence of animal magnetism must stand or fall on this\r\ntest. That was the difficulty during this period: the whole dispute\r\nwas waged about, and experiments consisted in tests of, clairvoyance,\r\ntransposition of the sense of sight, and other mystical phenomena,\r\ninstead of dealing with the state as such. This, of course, made the\r\nstruggle much easier for the opponents of mesmerism, but was largely\r\nthe fault of the magnetizers. The Burdin prize was not awarded, and in\r\n1840 Double proposed that the Academy should henceforth pay no further\r\nattention to animal magnetism, but treat the subject as definitely\r\nclosed. This was certainly unfair and unscientific, but was the\r\nattitude assumed.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this period another series of tests was being\r\nperformed in Germany, but after 1820 the belief in magnetism declined\r\nmore and more. It flourished longest in Bremen and in Hamburg where\r\nSiemers was its advocate. From 1830-1840 Hensler and Ennemoser were\r\nthe chief exponents in Bavaria. As the scientific investigators\r\nwithdrew from the study, the charlatans and frauds entered the field,\r\nand the marvellous and occult were emphasized, so that in 1840 little\r\ngeneral attention was paid to the subject.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the London physicians Elliotson and\r\nAshburner, magnetism could obtain little footing in England during\r\nthis period. Numerous investigations were made, however, and several\r\npublications were sent forth. Townshend, Scoresby, and Lee are names\r\nprominent in the study of the subject in England at this time. In the\r\nnext period, though, an Englishman gives the impetus necessary for the\r\nsuccessful pursuit of the study.\r\n\r\nIn 1841 the French magnetizer, La Fontaine, gave some public\r\nexhibitions in Manchester which attracted the attention of a physician\r\nby the name of James Braid. Through the aid rendered by Braid, animal\r\nmagnetism blossomed into a science. He directed the subject into its\r\nproper field: he eschewed the occult and mysterious, and emphasized\r\nobservation and experiment. It was Braid who gave us the word\r\n\"hypnotism.\" At first a sceptic, he began experimenting and proved\r\nthat fixity of gaze had in some way such an influence on the nervous\r\nsystem of the subject that he went off into a sleep. He therefore\r\nopined that the transmission of a fluid by the operator had no part in\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nHe further showed that an assumed attitude changed the subject's\r\nsentiments in harmony with the attitude, and that the degree of sleep\r\nvaried with different persons, and with the same person at different\r\ntimes. He also noted the acuteness of the senses during hypnosis, and\r\nthat verbal suggestion would produce hallucinations, emotions,\r\nparalysis, etc. Therapeutics was a subject in which he was naturally\r\ninterested, and his experiments on different diseases were frequent\r\nand valuable. Braid made some mistakes, as was natural, but his\r\ndiscoveries covered the field so well and his ideas were so sound\r\nthat too much credit cannot be ascribed to him. At first he thought\r\nhypnotism (Braidism) was identical with animal magnetism, but later\r\nmade the mistake of considering it analogous, and the two flourished\r\nside by side and independently.\r\n\r\nAnimal magnetism was first introduced into America in 1836 by Mr.\r\nCharles Poyan, a French gentleman. A few years later a certain Dr.\r\nCollyer lectured upon it in New England. New Orleans was, however, for\r\na long time its chief centre. In 1848 Grimes, working independently,\r\nappears to have arrived at about the same conclusions as Braid. He\r\nshowed that most of the hypnotic phenomena could be produced in the\r\nwaking state in some subjects, by means of verbal suggestion. The\r\nphenomena were known under the name of electro-biology. In 1850\r\nDarling went to England and introduced electro-biology, but it was\r\nsoon identified with Braidism, and in 1853 Durand de Gros, who wrote\r\nunder the pseudonym of Philips, exhibited the phenomena of\r\nelectro-biology in several countries, but aroused little attention.\r\n\r\nAzam of Bordeaux and Broca of Paris made some experiments following\r\nBraid's method, and several times performed some painless operations\r\nby this means. They were followed by numerous others in all European\r\ncountries and in America. In fact, the interest in the subject became\r\ngeneral, and as more was known about it, fewer objections were heard.\r\nSocieties were formed for the study of hypnotism, publications were\r\nstarted devoting all their space to the exposition and discussion of\r\nit, and as this third period advanced, its scientific value was more\r\nand more recognized from the stand-points of psychology, pathology,\r\nand therapeutics.\r\n\r\nIn a brief resume like this it would be impossible to name even the\r\nchief experimenters in the different countries who contributed to this\r\nperiod, but some names stand out so prominently that they should be\r\nemphasized, for they must be reckoned in importance with Braid's.\r\nLiebeault, whose book, _Du Sommeil_, _etc._, was published in 1866,\r\nhas been called the founder of the therapeutics of suggestion. While\r\nsuggestion in both waking and hypnotic states had been applied long\r\nbefore Liebeault's day, it was he who first fully and methodically\r\nrecognized its value. We are also indebted to him for stimulating in\r\nthe study of hypnosis Bernheim and other prominent investigators.\r\nLiebeault at the head of the School of Nancy was not less known than\r\nCharcot at the Salpetriere.\r\n\r\nCharcot was indefatigable in his researches, but was led away in his\r\nconclusions by artifacts. For example: three states were produced in\r\nthe hypnotic subject which Charcot considered to be symptomatic and\r\ncharacteristic. They were catalepsy, lethargy, and somnambulism.\r\nCertain physical excitations, such as rubbing the scalp or exposing\r\nthe eyes to a bright light, were thought to be all that was necessary\r\nto change the subject from one stage to another. It has since been\r\nshown that not only were the states of catalepsy, lethargy, and\r\nsomnambulism produced by suggestion, but the physical stimuli were\r\nsimply suggestions and signs by which the subject knew that a\r\nparticular change was expected, and, in harmony with hypnotic action,\r\nthe expected change came about. Not only did Charcot make this\r\nmistake, but some of his followers of the Salpetriere School continued\r\nto be deceived for years afterward.\r\n\r\nHardly a conclusion of Charcot's remains to-day, and yet so earnest\r\nwas he in his investigations and so untiring in his experiments, that\r\nmany of his facts contributed much to our knowledge of the subject\r\neven if his theories have been rejected. Binet, Fere, and other\r\nfollowers of his have contributed much to the science and literature\r\nof the subject. The latter half of this period is not unknown to us\r\nto-day, and as the names connected with it are familiar, it remains\r\nfor me to mention but one more name, that of the one who ushered in\r\nthe fourth period, F. W. H. Myers.\r\n\r\nFrom its beginning Myers was prominently connected with the Society\r\nfor Psychical Research and occupied the offices of president and\r\nsecretary. He held the latter position at the time of his death in\r\n1901. In 1887 he formulated his theory of the subliminal self or\r\nsubliminal consciousness, a theory which has come to be more and more\r\naccepted, and the value of which has received increasing appreciation.\r\nIt has been known as the \"subconscious self\" or the \"subconsciousness\"\r\nprobably more than by Myers's original title; and his theory has been\r\nmodified by some subtractions and additions, but it is generally\r\naccepted to-day and its exposition has helped solve many problems in\r\nabnormal psychology. In no department has it contributed more than in\r\nthat of hypnotism, for by it this state has been partially explained.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years Charcot and his followers put forward a\r\nphysiological theory of hypnotism which waged war with that of the\r\nNancy School, under Liebeault, but even before Charcot's death he\r\nrecognized the validity of the Nancy claims while still clinging to\r\nhis own. Few if any espouse Charcot's claims to-day. The general\r\npsychological theory of Nancy, which bases the results on suggestion,\r\nis that currently accepted, while a theory not very different from\r\nthat of animal magnetism has been held by some of those who accepted\r\nthe spiritualistic hypothesis, notably among whom was Myers.\r\n\r\nHypnotism to-day is recognized as the product of a long line of\r\nerroneous theory and zigzag development, but the wheat has largely\r\nbeen sifted and the chaff thrown to the winds of antiquity. Its\r\ntherapeutic and psychological value is duly recognized by science\r\nto-day.[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [187] Binet and Fere, _Animal Magnetism_, p. 8.\r\n\r\n  [188] C.

The healing by shrines, relics, and charms\r\ndiminished in the latter part of the century on account of the\r\nlessening of superstition and the better understanding of mental laws,\r\nbut additional work has thereby been laid upon the healers. The\r\ndevelopment of hypnotism and the exposition of the laws underlying it,\r\nthe collection and publication of cases of cures by mental means, the\r\nlessening of faith in noxious doses of drugs, the increase of nervous\r\ndiseases which are most easily helped by suggestive therapeutics, the\r\nattempted duplication of apostolic gifts on the part of some sects and\r\nthe general reaction against the materialism of the early part of the\r\ncentury as shown in the great revival of psychical study and research\r\nhave all been factors in the demand for mental medicine.\r\n\r\nThe healers have been of various kinds. Having already dealt with the\r\nmesmerizers and hypnotizers, we shall now look only at the classes of\r\nindependent and generally less scientific investigators and\r\nexperimenters. Some have not been regular healers but healed only\r\nincidentally, as, _e. g._, the revivalists; some have followed James\r\n5:14 f. in anointing with oil and praying--of these and others, some\r\nhave had institutions for housing the patients; some have been\r\nperipatetic healers; some have simply used prayer; some have\r\nestablished their systems on metaphysical bases and been the founders\r\nof sects; some have combined the results of scientific investigations\r\nin an endeavor to help mankind. Many of these have simply followed the\r\nways of their predecessors of former centuries, but a few started on\r\nnew lines of procedure. Whatever the method, they have all,\r\nconsciously or unconsciously, depended upon the influence of the\r\npatient's mind over his own body, and the now better understood laws\r\nof suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe revivals were eighteenth and nineteenth century phenomena, and in\r\ndiscussing the part which their leaders have taken in healing we may\r\nwell include the experience of Wesley. As a mere incident in his\r\nrevival work, John Wesley (1703-1791), the great founder of Methodism,\r\nappeared in the rather unenviable role of exorcist. It is to his\r\ncredit that he was not led away from his primary purpose by this\r\nexperience, but returned to his preaching without any effort to add\r\nhealing to his gifts. The account of his encounter with the demons can\r\nbest be given by quoting his own words, as found in his Journal.\r\n\r\n\"October 25 [1739]. I was sent for to one in Bristol who was taken ill\r\nthe evening before. She lay on the ground furiously gnashing her teeth\r\nand after a while roared aloud. It was not easy for three or four\r\npersons to hold her, especially when the name of Jesus was named. We\r\nprayed. The violence of her symptoms ceased, though without a complete\r\ndeliverance.\" Wesley was sent for later in the day. \"She began\r\nscreaming before I came into the room, then broke out into a horrid\r\nlaughter, mixed with blasphemy, grievous to hear. One who from many\r\ncircumstances apprehended a preternatural agent to be concerned in\r\nthis, asking, 'How didst thou dare to enter into a Christian?' was\r\nanswered, 'She is not a Christian, she is mine.' Then another\r\nquestion, 'Dost thou not tremble at the name of Jesus?' No words\r\nfollowed, but she shrunk back and trembled exceedingly. 'Art thou not\r\nincreasing thy own damnation?' It was faintly answered, 'Ay! Ay!'\r\nwhich was followed by fresh cursing and blasphemy ... with spitting,\r\nand all the expressions of strong aversion.\" Two days later Wesley\r\ncalled and prayed with her again, when \"All her pangs ceased in a\r\nmoment, she was filled with peace, and knew that the son of wickedness\r\nwas departed from her.\" On October 28 he exorcised two more demons\r\nwhom he had evidently (unconsciously) been the means of producing in\r\ntwo neurotic girls. He had a few other experiences in healing, but\r\nalways in an incidental way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN ALEXANDER DOWIE]\r\n\r\nCharles G. Finney (1792-1875) had at least one experience as a healer.\r\nDuring revival services at Antwerp, N. Y., in 1824, two insane women\r\nwere cured, but Finney was directly concerned in the restoration of\r\nonly one of them. Of this he gives an account in his memoirs. \"There\r\nwere two very striking cases of instantaneous recovery from insanity\r\nduring this revival. As I went into meeting in the afternoon of one\r\nSabbath, I saw several ladies sitting in a pew, with a woman dressed\r\nin black who seemed to be in great distress of mind; and they were\r\npartly holding her, and preventing her from going out. As I came in,\r\none of the ladies came to me and told me she was an insane woman.... I\r\nsaid a few words to her; but she replied that she must go; that she\r\ncould not hear any praying, or preaching, or singing; that hell was\r\nher portion, and she could not endure anything that made her think of\r\nheaven. I cautioned the ladies, privately, to keep her in her seat, if\r\nthey could, without her disturbing the meeting. I then went into the\r\npulpit and read a hymn. As soon as the singing began, she struggled\r\nhard to get out. But the ladies obstructed her passage; and kindly but\r\npersistently prevented her escape.... As I proceeded ... all at once\r\nshe startled the congregation by uttering a loud shriek. She then cast\r\nherself almost from her seat, held her head very low, and I could see\r\nthat she 'trembled very exceedingly.' ... As I proceeded she began to\r\nlook up again, and soon sat upright, with face wonderfully changed,\r\nindicating triumphant joy and peace.... She glorified God and rejoiced\r\nwith amazing triumph. About two years after, I met with her, and found\r\nher still full of joy and peace.\"[190]\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Mountain Evangelist,\" George O. Barnes, who was born in\r\n1827, added healing to his other revival efforts. After leaving the\r\nPresbyterian Church he did his work mostly in Kentucky as an\r\nindependent minister, and there anointed with oil according to James\r\n5:14 f. In his records little is said about the cures, but the daily\r\nnumber of anointings is given, amounting to at least five thousand in\r\nall. He believed that the devil, not God, sends sickness: God is the\r\ngreat healer. The anointing was simply a matter of faith. His formula\r\nvaried and was very simple, as _e. g._, \"Dear daughter, in Jesus's\r\nprecious name I anoint thee with this oil of healing for thy maladies.\r\nOh, go on thy way rejoicing. Be of good cheer. He is the great healer.\r\nHe will make thee whole. He hath commanded it. Lean thy whole weight\r\non Him.\"[191] His views may be judged by the following extract from a\r\nsermon of his on \"Our Healer\": \"Oh, the hospitals and drug-stores, the\r\nbitter doses, the pains and racks, the tortures--great God, may this\r\npeople believe to-day that thou hast nothing to do with this, that all\r\ncame in with sin, and the devil manages it all; and wherever we are\r\nafflicted God stands by wringing His hands, and saying, '... Return to\r\nme, O backsliding children. Come back to me, and I will keep the devil\r\noff of you.'\"[192] I take also some extracts from his daily record.\r\n\r\n  \"July 19 [1881]. John and I took a long walk.... I shall\r\n  not repeat the experiment, for I got many chiggers on\r\n  me, which are tormenting me from head to foot while I\r\n  write, I think because I trusted the pennyroyal to keep\r\n  them off me instead of the Lord. It was not wilful, but\r\n  a slip of forgetfulness, yet a door wide enough for\r\n  Satan to enter a little bit. Now, instead of trying\r\n  pennyroyal to get me rid of them, I will trust the Lord\r\n  only.\r\n\r\n  \"July 20. The chiggers gave exquisite torment. I shall\r\n  never trust in pennyroyal again.\r\n\r\n  \"July 21. Satan tried to get me wavering on the eye\r\n  question, but the dear Lord set me up more firmly than\r\n  ever.\r\n\r\n  \"July 24. We have gotten into a little trouble by\r\n  carelessly trying to help the dear Lord take care of his\r\n  little organ. A key was silent, and yesterday Marie\r\n  tried to remedy it. There was a good deal of taking out\r\n  of keys, and dusting--result, two keys silent now, and\r\n  one that won't be silent, but goes on in a bass wail\r\n  through every song. So much for meddling with the dear\r\n  Lord's work. We trust Him, when the lesson is learned,\r\n  to set the little machine all right again.... The dear\r\n  Lord cured the little organ this afternoon while we were\r\n  at dinner; at least it was all right, as Marie with a\r\n  happy smile informed me before she began to sing the\r\n  first song. I gave thanks for it in the opening prayer,\r\n  and then told the people all about it.\r\n\r\n  \"July 27. Satan is not a little busy with me, injecting\r\n  doubts as to the right to trust for eyes. Faith still\r\n  quenches all his fiery darts, although it sorely tries\r\n  me to be thus inactive in these long summer days,\r\n  without reading my beautiful edition of Young's\r\n  Concordance, useless at the bottom of my trunk. My\r\n  Revised New Testament I can only get at through\r\n  others.\"[193]\r\n\r\nLeaving now the revivalists, let us take up the cases of others not\r\nrevivalists who used anointing for healing. In her native hamlet of\r\nMaennedorf, Switzerland, Dorothea Trudel (1813-1862), the descendant\r\nof some generations of faith healers, cured many. Soon people began to\r\ncome to her from near and far and, finally, at the solicitation of a\r\n\"patient\" of rank, she purchased a home where the afflicted could be\r\nnear her. In 1856 the health authorities interfered. She was fined; an\r\nappeal was taken and, finally, she was permitted to carry on her work\r\nin connection with the home under some formal restrictions. During the\r\ncourse of the trial some authenticated cases of cure were produced:\r\n\"one stiff knee, pronounced incurable by the best surgeons of France,\r\nGermany, and Switzerland; a leading physician testified to the\r\nrecovery of a hopeless patient of his own; a burned foot, which was\r\nabout to be amputated to prevent impending death, was healed without\r\nmeans. The evidence was incontrovertible, and the cases numerous. The\r\ncure was often contemporaneous with the confession of Christ by the\r\nunbelieving patient; but duration of the sickness varied with each\r\ncase. Lunatics were commonly sent forth cured in a brief while.\"\r\nNothing miraculous was claimed and no war was waged against\r\nphysicians. It was not asserted that a cure was infallibly made, but\r\nit was pointed out as a simpler and more direct method. The means\r\nemployed were gentleness, discipline, Bible reading, prayer, and\r\nanointing. After the death of Dorothea the home continued under the\r\nsupervision of Mr. Samuel Zeller.\r\n\r\nCharles Cullis (1833-1892), a young physician of Boston, suffered a\r\ncrushing bereavement in the death of his wife shortly after their\r\nmarriage, and then vowed to devote his life to charity. Inspired by\r\nMueller's _Life of Trust_ he established a number of charitable\r\ninstitutions, relying on prayer and faith for their support. Some of\r\nthese institutions were for the cure of the sick, and in connection\r\nwith these, and otherwise, Dr. Cullis anointed and prayed with all who\r\ncame to him. Every summer a camp-meeting was held at Old Orchard\r\nBeach, Maine, where the large collections gathered were the subject of\r\nannual comment. He was followed in his work by Rev. A. B. Simpson, of\r\nNew York, who now conducts it. The latter was formerly a Presbyterian\r\nminister but is now an independent. He still heals and takes\r\nup collections. From the efforts of Cullis and Simpson have\r\ncome the Christian and Missionary Alliance and other similar\r\norganizations with Pentecost as the text and apostolic gifts as the\r\nmuch-sought-after prize. The proof of success is found in healing,\r\nspeaking with tongues, trances, visions, and other abnormal phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe \"Holy Ghost and Us\" movement, with headquarters at Shiloh, Maine,\r\nwas an outgrowth of the Christian and Missionary Alliance propaganda.\r\nRev. F. W. Sanford (1863- ) was born on Bowdoinham Ridge, Maine. He\r\ngraduated at Bates College in 1886 and attended Cobb Divinity School\r\nfor a short time. His ordination took place in 1887, after which he\r\nheld two pastorates of three years each, presumedly in Free Baptist\r\nchurches. In 1891, while attending meetings at Old Orchard, he was\r\ninspired to start \"a movement on strictly apostolic lines, which was\r\nto sweep the entire globe.\" He started on this new work early in 1893\r\nwith Shiloh, Maine, as the centre. Relying on faith alone, several\r\nbuildings were erected and paid for, among which is Bethesda--a Home\r\nof Healing: \"For those who believe God told the truth when He said,\r\n'The prayer of Faith shall save the sick.'\" In an account of the\r\nhealing we read: \"We have seen ... in at least one case, the\r\nrestoration of the dead to life.\" Quite a following embraced the\r\ndoctrine at one time, but lately there has been a considerable\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\nAn institution for faith healing was established in the north of\r\nLondon by Rev. W. E. Boardman (1810-1886). He called it \"Bethshan\" or\r\nthe \"Nursery of Faith\" and refused to permit it to be called a\r\nhospital. The usual method of treatment was by anointing with oil and\r\nprayer, but it was claimed that many also were healed by\r\ncorrespondence. The results professed were very extravagant, among the\r\ncases being cancer, paralysis, advanced consumption, chronic\r\nrheumatism, and lameness of different kinds. As a proof of the cure of\r\nthe last named affliction, numerous canes and crutches left behind by\r\nthe healed were on exhibition.[194]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Lord Radstock practised healing through anointing in\r\nAustralia about the same time.\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of prominent healers who have used prayer,\r\nand perhaps the laying on of hands, as the means for healing, and have\r\nusually eschewed anointing. Among these was Prince Hohenlohe\r\n(1794-1849). His was probably the greatest name in mental healing in\r\nthe nineteenth century. He was born in Waldenburg and educated at\r\nseveral institutions. He was ordained priest in 1815 and officiated\r\nat Olmuetz, Munich, and other places. In 1820 he met a peasant, Martin\r\nMichel, who had performed some wonderful cures, and in connection with\r\nhim effected a so-called miraculous cure on a princess of\r\nSchwarzenberg who had been for some years a paralytic.[195] From this\r\nexperience he became enthusiastic in healing, and he acquired such a\r\nfame as a performer of miraculous cures that multitudes flocked from\r\ndifferent countries to receive the benefit of his supposed\r\nsupernatural gifts. In one year (1848-49) there were eighteen thousand\r\npeople who obtained access to him. His name and his titles probably\r\nhad not a little to do with his wide influence. They were Alexander\r\nLeopold Franz Emmerich, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfuerst,\r\nArchbishop and Grand Provost of Grosswardein, Hungary, and Abbot of St.\r\nMichael's at Gaborjan.\r\n\r\nThe testimony concerning his cures is from reliable witnesses. Notice\r\nthe letter written by the ex-King of Bavaria to Count von Sinsheim,\r\ndescribing his own case:\r\n\r\n  My dear Count:\r\n\r\n  There are still miracles. The ten last days of the last\r\n  month, the people of Wuerzburg might believe themselves\r\n  in the times of the Apostles. The deaf heard, the blind\r\n  saw, the lame freely walked, not by the aid of art, but\r\n  by a few short prayers, and by the invocation of the\r\n  name of Jesus.... On the evening of the 28th, the number\r\n  of persons cured, of both sexes, and of every age,\r\n  amounted to more than twenty. These were of all classes\r\n  of the people, from the humblest to a prince of the\r\n  blood, who, without any exterior means, recovered, on\r\n  the 27th at noon, the hearing which he had lost from\r\n  his infancy. This cure was effected by a prayer made for\r\n  him during some minutes, by a priest who is scarcely\r\n  more than twenty-seven years of age--the Prince\r\n  Hohenlohe. Although I do not hear so well as the\r\n  majority of the persons who are about me, there is no\r\n  comparison between my actual state and that which it was\r\n  before. Besides, I perceive daily that I hear more\r\n  clearly.... My hearing, at present, is very sensitive.\r\n  Last Friday, the music of the troop which defiled in the\r\n  square in front of the palace, struck my tympanum so\r\n  strongly, that for the first time, I was obliged to\r\n  close the window of my cabinet.\r\n\r\n  The inhabitants of Wuerzburg have testified, by the most\r\n  lively and sincere acclamations, the pleasure which my\r\n  cure has given them. You are at liberty to communicate\r\n  my letter, and to allow any one who wishes, to take a\r\n  copy of it.\r\n\r\n  Bruckenau, _July 3d, 1822_. Louis, _Prince Royal_.\r\n\r\nProfessor Onymus, of the University of Wuerzburg, reported a number of\r\ncases cured by Prince Hohenlohe, which he himself witnessed. He gives\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n  \"Captain Ruthlein, an old gentleman of Thundorf, 70\r\n  years of age, who had long been pronounced incurable of\r\n  paralysis, which kept his hand clenched, and who had not\r\n  left his room for many years, has been perfectly cured.\r\n  Eight days after his cure he paid me a visit, rejoicing\r\n  in the happiness of being able to walk freely.\r\n\r\n  \"A man, of about 50, named Bramdel, caused himself to be\r\n  carried by six men from Carlstadt to the Court at\r\n  Stauffenburg. His arms and legs were utterly paralyzed,\r\n  hanging like those of a dead man, and his face was of a\r\n  corpse-like pallor. On the prayer of the Prince he was\r\n  instantly cured, rose to his feet, and walked perfectly,\r\n  to the profound astonishment of all present.\r\n\r\n  \"A student of Burglauer, near Murmerstadt, had lost for\r\n  two years the use of his legs; he was brought in a\r\n  carriage, and though he was only partially relieved by\r\n  the first and second prayer of the Prince, at the third\r\n  he found himself perfectly well.\r\n\r\n  \"These cures are real and they are permanent. If any one\r\n  would excite doubts of the genuineness of the cases\r\n  operated by Prince Hohenlohe, it is only necessary to\r\n  come hither and consult a thousand other eye and ear\r\n  witnesses like myself. Every one is ready to give all\r\n  possible information about them.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe Mormons, under the leadership of Joseph Smith, Jr. (1805-1844),\r\nwere healing the sick about the time that Prince Hohenlohe was\r\nperforming his miracles on the other side of the water. Smith was born\r\nin Sharon, Vermont. The Mormon Church (The Church of Jesus Christ of\r\nLatter Day Saints) was founded in 1830 in Palmyra, New York, and moved\r\nfrom there to Kirkland, Ohio; Independence, Missouri; Nauvoo,\r\nIllinois; and thence to Utah. Smith was successively first elder,\r\nprophet, seer, and revelator. The year the church was founded Smith\r\nbegan his healing career as an exorcist, casting the devil out of\r\nNewel Knight in Colesville, New York. Following this, there was a firm\r\nbelief in demoniacal possession, and exorcism was practised by both\r\nSmith and his followers, principally by means of command. This\r\nexorcism led up to faith healing.\r\n\r\nSmith's maternal uncle, Jason Mack, was a firm believer in healing by\r\nprayer and practised it; later, the Oneida Community of Perfectionists\r\nin western New York cured by faith; both of these facts would be known\r\nto the founder of Mormonism. After adopting faith healing he soon\r\nbecame proficient in the art. Numerous well-attested cures were\r\nperformed by Smith and his followers in other places. Elder Richards\r\nadvertised in England \"Bones set through Faith in Christ,\" and Elder\r\nPhillips made the additional statement that \"while commanding the\r\nbones, they came together, making a noise like the crushing of an old\r\nbasket.\" All forms of disease were treated, but not always\r\nsuccessfully, as may be inferred from Smith's own words: \"The cholera\r\nburst forth among us, even those on guard fell to the earth with their\r\nguns in their hands.... At the commencement I attempted to lay on\r\nhands for their recovery, but I quickly learned by painful experience,\r\nthat when the great Jehovah decrees destruction upon any people, makes\r\nknown His determination, man must not attempt to stay his hand.\" The\r\nmeans employed varied, but included at different times prayer,\r\ncommand, laying on of hands, consecrated handkerchiefs and other\r\ncloths, baptism, and infrequently anointing.[197]\r\n\r\nCrossing the ocean again, we find Johann Christolph Blumhardt\r\n(1805-1880) performing wonderful acts of healing. He assumed his first\r\nindependent charge in 1838 when he became pastor of the village church\r\nat Moettlinger, Wurtemberg. He was known afterward as Pastor\r\nBlumhardt. Among his parishioners was Gottliebin Ditters, generally\r\nthought to be possessed by an evil spirit. After two years prayer and\r\ncare for this woman, he saw her restored to peace of mind. This was\r\nthe beginning of a life of faith in the efficacy of prayer for\r\nhealing. After the restoration of Gottliebin a spontaneous and\r\nentirely unexpected revival took place in Moettlinger. Multitudes came\r\nfrom afar to hear this sincere man preach his simple sermons, and in\r\nmany cases bodily disease left those who confessed and upon whom\r\nBlumhardt laid his hands. It became noised about that those who\r\nrepented, with whom the pastor prayed and upon whom he laid his hands,\r\nwould be healed. \"One morning a mother rushed to his house, saying\r\nthat she had by an accident scalded her child with boiling soup. The\r\ninfant was found screaming with agony. He took the child in his arms,\r\nprayed over it, and it grew quiet. It had no further pain, and the\r\neffects of the scalding were quickly gone. Another child was nearly\r\nblind with disease. A neighboring pastor, when consulted, said to the\r\nparents: 'If you believe Jesus can and will heal your child, by all\r\nmeans go to Blumhardt, but if you have not got the faith, don't do it\r\non any account; let an operation be performed.' 'Well, we have faith,'\r\nthey said, and went to Blumhardt. Three days after it was perfectly\r\nwell.\" These events could not fail to attract attention, and miracles\r\nor healings from his prayers were of constant occurrence. In 1852\r\nBlumhardt moved to Boll, Wurtemberg, and until his death he continued\r\nhis healing. He did not despise human means of healing, but he stoutly\r\nheld that Jesus would answer the prayer of faith uttered for and by\r\nthe sick.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the century Father Mathew (1790-1856) attracted a\r\nlarge number of persons who were in need of healing. He was best\r\nknown as the famous apostle of temperance, and was to Ireland in the\r\nnineteenth century what Wesley was to England in the eighteenth. He\r\nalso travelled over England and Scotland and spent two years in\r\nAmerica. In one period of nine months he induced two hundred thousand\r\npersons to take the temperance pledge. Among other things he cured\r\nblindness, lameness, paralysis, hysteria, headache, and lunacy. After\r\nhis death the same diseases which he had cured during his lifetime\r\nwere just as effectively relieved by visiting the good father's tomb,\r\nin the firm belief that a miracle would be performed. From the\r\nfollowing cure, his first one, it will be seen that the discovery of\r\nhis healing power was rather accidental.\r\n\r\n  \"A young lady, of position and intelligence, was for\r\n  years the victim of the most violent headaches, which\r\n  assumed a chronic character. Eminent advice was had but\r\n  in vain; the malady became more intense, the agony more\r\n  excruciating. Starting up one day from the sofa on which\r\n  she lay in a delirium of pain, she exclaimed--'I cannot\r\n  endure this torture any longer; I will go and see what\r\n  Father Mathew can do for me.' She immediately proceeded\r\n  to Lehanagh, where Father Mathew was then sick and\r\n  feeble. Flinging herself on her knees before him she\r\n  besought his prayers and blessing. In fact, stung by\r\n  intolerable suffering she asked him to cure her. 'My\r\n  dear child, you ask me what no mortal has power to do.\r\n  The power to cure rests alone with God. I have no such\r\n  power.' 'Then bless me, and pray for me--place your hand\r\n  on my head,' implored the afflicted lady. 'I cannot\r\n  refuse to pray for you, or to bless you,' said Father\r\n  Mathew, who did pray for and bless her, and place his\r\n  hand upon her poor throbbing brow. Was it faith?--was it\r\n  magnetism?--was it the force of imagination exerted\r\n  wonderfully? I shall not venture to pronounce what it\r\n  was; but that lady returned to her home perfectly cured\r\n  of her distressing malady. More than that--cured\r\n  completely, from that moment, forward.\"[198]\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, Mrs. Elizabeth Mix, a negro woman living in\r\nConnecticut, achieved great fame through her healing by prayer. Many\r\ntestified to the efficacy of her prayers and bewailed her death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE O. BARNES]\r\n\r\nFrancis Schlatter (1856-1909) was a native of Alsace, France. He was\r\nborn a Roman Catholic and, so far as he was affiliated with any\r\ndenomination, always remained one. When a year old, he was blind and\r\ndeaf and was cured by his mother's prayers. He came to America in\r\n1891, and first settled at Jamestown, Long Island. Early in 1893 he\r\nmoved to Denver, Colorado, and in the following July he felt impelled\r\nby inner promptings to start out, he knew not whither. Probably\r\nmentally unbalanced, he wandered through the wilderness of the great\r\nSouthwest without shoes or hat. Fasts, temptations, visions, arrests\r\nand imprisonments, and healings combined to furnish his experience\r\nduring these wanderings, always, as he said, being led by the Father.\r\nIn July, 1895, he arrived at Las Lunas, New Mexico, where he first\r\nattracted public attention as a healer. From here he went to\r\nAlbuquerque, where he treated as many as six hundred persons in a day,\r\nmany very effectively. After forty days' fast, which was broken by a\r\nhearty meal of solid food, he went to Denver and here reached the\r\npinnacle of his fame and success. At the home of a sympathizer, daily\r\nfrom 9 A. M. to 4 P. M., he treated those who came to him, always\r\nwithout any remuneration. From two thousand to five thousand people\r\nwould congregate in line, reaching nearly around a city block, five or\r\nsix abreast, but he was never able to treat more than two thousand in\r\na day. Crowds came from other cities, and some few from great\r\ndistances, even the New England States. He stood inside a fence, and\r\nas each one came along he held the patient's hand for a short time;\r\nlifting up his eyes, he prayed and then assured the sufferer of\r\nrelief within a certain time. Through the mail and in other ways he\r\nreceived handkerchiefs which he blessed and returned with assurance of\r\nrelief through them. Not all cases handled were restored to health or\r\neven noticeably eased, but large numbers testified to cures, some of\r\nwhich came immediately and others by degrees. He did not preach.\r\nAlthough he never claimed it, when asked, \"Are you the Christ?\" he\r\nalways replied, \"I am.\" He wore a beard and long hair, and dressed in\r\nthe plainest clothes. In appearance he looked not unlike the pictures\r\nof the traditional Christ. Afterward he appeared in different parts of\r\nthe United States, but never with the same success in healing as in\r\nDenver.[199]\r\n\r\nThe once famous Dr. Newton arrived in Boston in 1859 on one of his\r\nvisits, and caused an extraordinary sensation. Astonishing results\r\nwere reported in the way of cures. The lame, having no further need of\r\ncrutches, left them behind; the blind were cured, and several chronic\r\ncases were relieved. He had many followers and disciples among whom\r\nwas \"Dr.\" Bryant, who settled in Detroit and healed there. Rev. J. M.\r\nBuckley, D.D., met Dr. Newton on a Mississippi steam-boat, when the\r\nlatter was returning from Havana with his daughter who was very low\r\nwith consumption, and the father doubted if she would reach home\r\nalive. When asked \"Doctor, why could you not heal her?\" he replied \"It\r\nseems as if we cannot always affect our own kindred.\" At this time he\r\ndenounced his pupil, Dr. Bryant, as an \"unmitigated fraud who had no\r\ngenuine healing power.\"\r\n\r\n  \"If Bryant be an unmitigated fraud, how do you account\r\n  for the cures which he makes?\" asked Dr. Buckley.\r\n\r\n  \"Oh!\" said the doctor, \"they are caused by the faith of\r\n  the people and the concentration of their minds upon his\r\n  operations with the expectation of being cured. Now,\"\r\n  said he, \"nobody would go to see Bryant unless they had\r\n  some faith that he might cure them, and when he begins\r\n  his operations with great positiveness of manner, and\r\n  when they see the crutches he has there, and hear the\r\n  people testify that they have been cured, it produces a\r\n  tremendous influence on them; and then he gets them\r\n  started in the way of exercising, and they do a good\r\n  many things that they thought they could not do; their\r\n  appetites and spirits revive, and if toning them up can\r\n  possibly reduce the diseased tendency, many of them will\r\n  get well.\"\r\n\r\n  Said Dr. Buckley: \"Doctor, pardon me, is not that a\r\n  correct account of the manner in which you perform your\r\n  wonderful works?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Oh, no,\" said he; \"the difference between a genuine\r\n  healer and a quack like Bryant is as wide as the\r\n  poles.\"[200]\r\n\r\nFather John of Cronstadt (1829-1908) was a saintly man, and furnishes\r\nus with an example of the healers among the Orthodox Church of the\r\nEast. He was famed in all Russia for his sanctity, and was so thronged\r\nby crowds for his healing power that he often had to escape by side\r\ndoors after celebrating the communion. His cures were many, but I\r\nchoose his own account of one as an example.\r\n\r\n  \"A certain person who was sick unto death from\r\n  inflammation of the bowels for nine days, without having\r\n  obtained the slightest relief from medical aid, as soon\r\n  as he had communicated of the Holy Sacrament, upon the\r\n  morning of the ninth day, regained his health and rose\r\n  from his bed of sickness in the evening of the same day.\r\n  He received the Holy Communion with firm faith. I prayed\r\n  to the Lord to cure him. 'Lord,' said I, 'heal thy\r\n  servant of his sickness. He is worthy, therefore grant\r\n  him this. He loves thy priests and sends them his\r\n  gifts.' I also prayed for him in church before the altar\r\n  of the Lord, at the Liturgy, during the prayer: 'Thou\r\n  who hast given us grace at this time, with one accord to\r\n  make our common supplication unto thee,' and before the\r\n  Holy Mysteries themselves. I prayed in the following\r\n  words: 'Lord, our life! It is as easy for thee to cure\r\n  every malady as it is for me to think of healing. It is\r\n  as easy for thee to raise every man from the dead as it\r\n  is for me to think of the possibility of the\r\n  resurrection of the dead. Cure, then, thy servant Basil\r\n  of his cruel malady, and do not let him die; do not let\r\n  his wife and children be given up to weeping.' And the\r\n  Lord graciously heard, and had mercy upon him, although\r\n  he was within a hair's breadth of death. Glory to thine\r\n  omnipotence and mercy, that thou, Lord, hast vouchsafed\r\n  to hear me!\"[201]\r\n\r\nFor the past century and a half healing has been carried on among the\r\nPennsylvania Germans by means of a superstitious practice known as\r\n\"Pow-wow.\" A book called _The Sixth Book of Moses, or Black Art_ is\r\nsaid to be the basis of the practice. The practitioners are usually\r\nwomen of the most ignorant, degraded, and, not infrequently, immoral\r\nclass, and in harmony with this, a firm belief in witchcraft is\r\nentertained by them. Notwithstanding this, they are employed at times\r\nby intelligent and respectable people, even by those whose standing in\r\nthe community might well guarantee a disbelief in such incantations.\r\nThe healers treat for burns, erysipelas and all skin diseases, goitre,\r\ntumors, rheumatism, and some other similar troubles. They have\r\ndifferent formulas for the various diseases, and the belief is current\r\nthat if a healer should reveal the formula to her own sex, she would\r\nlose her power, and if she told more than one of the opposite sex,\r\nthe power would be taken from her. The following is the method of\r\noperating for burns:\r\n\r\n  \"Take a piece of red woolen yarn and wrap it into the\r\n  shape of a ball. Pass it slowly around the burn and\r\n  while doing so, repeat three times, 'The fire burneth,\r\n  water quencheth, the pain ceaseth.' After which reverse\r\n  the movement and repeat the words again three times.\r\n  Then take the yarn upstairs, pull out the chimney-stop,\r\n  put the yarn in the chimney, and as soon as it\r\n  disappears the burn is healed.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been a number of cases of local healers and I give two\r\nexamples: \"At the time of the prevalence of cholera in Canada, a man\r\nnamed Ayers, who came out of the States, and was said to be a graduate\r\nof the University of New Jersey, was given out to be St. Roche, the\r\nprincipal patron saint of the Canadians, and renowned for his power in\r\naverting pestilential diseases. He was reported to have descended from\r\nheaven to cure his suffering people of the cholera, and many were the\r\ncases in which he appeared to afford relief. Many were thus\r\ndispossessed of their fright in anticipation of the disease, who\r\nmight, probably, but for his inspiriting influence, have fallen\r\nvictims to their apprehensions. The remedy he employed was an\r\nadmixture of maple sugar, charcoal, and lard.\"[202]\r\n\r\n\"The _Month_ for June, 1892, published an account, by the late Earl of\r\nDenbigh, of a cure worked by a member of a family named Cancelli of\r\nLady Denbigh in 1850. She was suffering severely from rheumatism, and\r\nthe Pope (Pius IX) mentioned to the Earl that near Foligno there was a\r\nfamily of peasants who were credited with a miraculous power of curing\r\nrheumatic disorders. Lord Denbigh succeeded in getting one of the\r\nfamily, an old man, to come, and learned from him the legend of the\r\ncure. The belief was that in the reign of Nero, the Apostles Peter and\r\nPaul took refuge in the hut of an old couple named Cancelli, near\r\nFoligno, and, as a proof of gratitude, gave to the male descendants of\r\nthe family living near the spot the power of curing rheumatic\r\ndisorders to the end of time. Lord Denbigh described how the old man\r\nmade a solemn invocation, using the sign of the cross, and, in fact,\r\nLady Denbigh did recover at once. In a few days the pains returned,\r\nbut she made an act of resignation, and they then left her, and never\r\nreturned with any acuteness.\"[203]\r\n\r\nWhat we may designate \"Metaphysical Healing\" originated with Phineas\r\nParkhurst Quimby (1802-1866). The movement was important, not so much\r\non account of what Quimby himself was able to accomplish by it, as\r\nbecause of the work that has been carried on since by at least three\r\nof his pupils. He was born in Lebanon, New Hampshire, and in early\r\nlife was a watch and clock maker. In 1840 he began experimenting with\r\nmesmerism, and accounts of these experiments were published in the\r\nMaine papers of that time. After this he developed a system of mental\r\nhealing of his own, practising it in different towns in Maine for some\r\nyears. About 1858 he settled as a practitioner in Portland and\r\nremained there until his death. I shall quote brief extracts in his\r\nown words, which portray his system.\r\n\r\n  \"My practice is unlike all medical practice. I give no\r\n  medicine, and make no outward applications. I tell the\r\n  patient his troubles, and what he thinks is his disease;\r\n  and my explanation is the cure. If I succeed in\r\n  correcting his errors, I change the fluids of the system\r\n  and establish the truth, or health. The truth is the\r\n  cure. This mode of practice applies to all cases.\"\r\n\r\n  \"The greatest evil that follows taking an opinion for a\r\n  truth is disease.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Man is made up of truth and belief; and, if he is\r\n  deceived into a belief that he has, or is liable to\r\n  have, a disease, the belief is catching, and the effect\r\n  follows it.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Disease being made by our belief, or by our parents'\r\n  belief, or by public opinion, there is no formula to be\r\n  adopted, but every one must be reached in his\r\n  particular case. Therefore it requires great shrewdness\r\n  or wisdom to get the better of the error. Disease is our\r\n  error and the work of the devil.\"[204]\r\n\r\nQuimby made many wonderful and mostly speedy cures, and although he\r\nwrote out his system, it has never been published. Among his patients\r\nwas Mrs. Patterson from Hill, New Hampshire, who went to Portland in\r\n1862. She had been a confirmed invalid for six years. To quote her own\r\nwords, published in the _Portland Evening Courier_ in 1862, she made a\r\nrapid recovery. \"Three weeks since I quitted my nurse and sick room en\r\nroute for Portland. The belief of my recovery had died out of the\r\nhearts of those who were most anxious for it. With this mental and\r\nphysical depression I first visited P. P. Quimby, and in less than one\r\nweek from that time I ascended by a stairway of one hundred and\r\neighty-two steps to the dome of the City Hall, and am improving _ad\r\ninfinitum_. To the most subtle reasoning, such a proof, coupled, too,\r\nas it is with numberless similar ones, demonstrates his power to\r\nheal.\" Mrs. Patterson, afterward Mrs. Eddy, proclaimed after his death\r\na doctrine very similar to Quimby's. She called it \"Christian\r\nScience,\" a name Quimby applied to his teaching, although usually he\r\ncalled it \"Science of Health.\"\r\n\r\nAnother patient of Quimby's was Julius A. Dresser, who visited him\r\nfirst in 1860. Of him Mr. Dresser says: \"The first person in this age\r\nwho penetrated the depths of truth so far as to discover and bring\r\nforth a true science of life, and publicly apply it to the healing of\r\nthe sick, was Phineas Parkhurst Quimby of Belfast, Me.\"\r\n\r\nRev. W. F. Evans was still another patient and disciple of Quimby's.\r\nHis testimony is as follows: \"Disease being in its root a wrong\r\nbelief, change that belief and we cure the disease.... The late Dr.\r\nQuimby, of Portland, one of the most successful healers of this or any\r\nage, embraced this view of the nature of disease, and by a long\r\nsuccession of most remarkable cures ... proved the truth of the\r\ntheory.... Had he lived in a remote age or country, the wonderful\r\nfacts which occurred in his practice would have now been deemed either\r\nmythical or miraculous.\"\r\n\r\nThese three, Messrs. Evans and Dresser and Mrs. Eddy, proved to be\r\nQuimby's most famous patients and disciples. Evans became a noted and\r\nvoluminous writer on mental healing, Mr. Dresser has been identified\r\nwith the New Thought movement of which his son H. W. Dresser is\r\nprobably the best exponent, and Mrs. Eddy ruled the Christian\r\nScientists with a rod of iron.\r\n\r\nWarren F. Evans visited Quimby twice in the year 1863, and at these\r\ntimes obtained his knowledge of Quimby's methods. Up to this time he\r\nhad been a Swedenborgian clergyman, and his beliefs enabled him the\r\nbetter to grasp the new doctrines. On the occasion of the second visit\r\nhe told his healer that he thought he could cure the sick in this way,\r\nand Quimby agreed with him. On returning home he tried it, and his\r\nfirst attempts were so successful that he became a practitioner, using\r\nonly mental means, and continued in this work. He wrote several books\r\non the subject of mental healing, the first one, _The Mental Cure_,\r\nappearing in 1869, six years before Mrs. Eddy's _Science and Health_.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, strictly speaking, the New Thought movement does not come\r\nwithin the scope of our subject, except as we see in it an outgrowth\r\nand application of the Quimby doctrine, for two reasons. In the first\r\nplace, its purpose is mental hygiene rather than cure, and it is all\r\nthe more valuable for that. Of course, in establishing hygienic\r\npractices many disorders are cured, but prevention is the main\r\nfeature. The second reason why we might perhaps not include it in a\r\nresume of the healers is that it is intended to be for the use of the\r\nindividual to prevent his employing a healer of any kind. The same\r\nobjection, however, would do away to some extent with a discussion of\r\nChristian Science. The principles of New Thought are that the mind has\r\nan influence on the body, and that good, sweet, pure thoughts have a\r\nsalutary effect, but the opposite ones injure the body. Don't worry,\r\ndon't think of disease, don't look for trouble, but fill the mind\r\nwith the opposite positive thoughts and life will be happy and the\r\nbody will be well. The doctrines are expounded differently by the\r\nvarious leaders, and emphasis is laid on different points, some\r\nemphasizing more fully the religious aspects of the movement, for\r\nexample. The principal writers on the subject are H. W. Dresser, R. W.\r\nTrine, H. Wood, and H. Fletcher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary A. Morse Baker Glover Patterson Eddy (1821-1910) was born at\r\nBow, New Hampshire. After a precocious and neurotic childhood, she\r\nunited with the Congregational Church when seventeen years of age. At\r\nthe age of twenty-two she married George Washington Glover, probably\r\nthe best of her husbands. His death, six months later, was followed by\r\nthe birth of her only child and a ten years' widowhood. During this\r\ntime she stayed with her relatives and had long periods of illness,\r\nprincipally of an hysterical character. She then experimented to some\r\nextent with mesmerism and clairvoyance. In 1853 she married Dr. Daniel\r\nPatterson, an itinerant dentist, from whom she got a divorce, and as\r\nMrs. Patterson she went first to \"Dr.\" Quimby in 1862. She visited\r\nQuimby again in 1864, at which time, with some others, she studied\r\nwith him. After Quimby's death she began teaching what she then called\r\nhis science. For the next few years she wandered from town to town\r\nabout Boston in straitened circumstances, healing, teaching, and\r\nendeavoring to found an organized society. It was not, however, until\r\n1875 that the organization was formed in Lynn, and later in the same\r\nyear appeared her _Science and Health_. The years since then have been\r\nfilled with controversies in the law courts and newspapers, caresses\r\nand blows from the ruling hand of Mother Eddy, and numerous\r\ndevelopments from small beginnings, until now over one hundred\r\nthousand are identified with the organization. These are almost\r\nwithout exception proselytes from other churches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARY BAKER EDDY]\r\n\r\nMrs. Eddy's doctrines are founded on a metaphysical theory known as\r\nsubjective idealism, and advanced centuries before her birth. It\r\nposits the all-comprehensiveness of mind and the non-existence of\r\nmatter. If bodies do not exist, diseases cannot exist, and must be\r\nonly mental delusions. If the mind is freed of these delusions the\r\ndisease is gone. This was Quimby's method of procedure already quoted.\r\nIn _Science and Health_ she says that the object of treatment is \"to\r\ndestroy the patient's belief in his physical condition.\" She also\r\nadvises: \"Mentally contradict every complaint of the body.\" She\r\ncontinues: \"All disease is the result of education, and can carry its\r\nill effects no further than mortal mind maps out the way. Destroy\r\nfear,\" she says, \"and you end the fever.\" However, as with other\r\nhealers, practice and theory are two different things. Listen further:\r\n\"It would be foolish to venture beyond our present understanding,\r\nfoolish to stop eating, until we gain more goodness and a clearer\r\ncomprehension of the living God.\" Again: \"Until the advancing age\r\nadmits the efficacy and the supremacy of Mind, it is better to leave\r\nthe adjustment of broken bones and dislocations to the fingers of the\r\nsurgeon, while you confine yourself chiefly to mental reconstruction,\r\nand the prevention of inflammation and protracted confinement.\"[205]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Christian Science, no modern religious movement\r\nhas come so prominently before the public and gained so many adherents\r\nin a short time as the Christian Catholic Apostle Church of Zion, and\r\nboth movements owe their popularity solely to their healing. John\r\nAlexander Dowie (1847-1907), the founder of this sect, was born in\r\nEdinburgh, Scotland, but in 1860, with his parents, he went to\r\nAustralia, returning for two years to his native city for college\r\nstudy. In 1870 he was ordained to the Congregational ministry. He\r\nserved three churches, and after some political activity was offered a\r\nportfolio in the Australian cabinet of Sir Henry Parks. In 1882 he\r\nwent to Melbourne and established a large independent church, building\r\na tabernacle for worship. About this time he became a firm believer in\r\nDivine Healing in direct answer to prayer. He arrived in San Francisco\r\nin 1888 and spent two years in organizing branches of the Divine\r\nHealing Association of which he was president. He went to Chicago in\r\n1890 and continued there holding meetings for some years. In 1895 he\r\nbroke away from the International Divine Healing Association, which he\r\nhad been chiefly instrumental in organizing, and insisted that his\r\nfollowers should not remain in the churches. The following year the\r\nChristian Catholic Church was organized. Of this organization Mr.\r\nDowie was known as General Overseer, then as Prophet, and in 1904 as\r\nFirst Apostle. He also proclaimed himself in general as the messenger\r\nof the Covenant and Elijah the Restorer. In 1900 Mr. Dowie said:\r\n\"About twenty-two thousand have been baptized by triune immersion up\r\nto the present, and this includes practically all the members.\" This,\r\nhowever, was a great exaggeration. In 1901 the head-quarters of the\r\nchurch was moved to Zion City, forty-two miles north of Chicago. He\r\npreached the threefold gospel of Salvation, Healing, and Holy Living.\r\nDowie differed from Christian Science in proclaiming the reality of\r\ndisease, the distinctive feature of his doctrine being that all bodily\r\nailment is the work of the Devil, and that Christ came to destroy the\r\nworks of the Devil. His contempt for external means may be judged from\r\nthe title of a pamphlet, _Doctors, Drugs, and Devils_; nevertheless,\r\nhe used physicians at least to diagnose cases at different times, a\r\nlicensed medical doctor, Speicher, being associated with him from the\r\nbeginning of his work in Chicago. Dentists are a factor of Zion City,\r\nand it is said he also used an oculist. According to his doctrine\r\nthere are four methods of cure: \"The first is the direct prayer of\r\nfaith; the second, intercessory prayer of two or more; the third, the\r\nanointing of the elders, with the prayer of faith; and the fourth, the\r\nlaying on of hands of those who believe, and whom God has prepared and\r\ncalled to that ministry.\" In addition to this, teaching is the basis\r\nof all other methods. The first ten years of his healing he is said to\r\nhave laid hands on eighteen thousand sick, and he declared that the\r\ngreater part of them were fully healed. In some of his later years he\r\nsaid in an issue of his paper: \"I pray and lay hands on seventy\r\nthousand people in a year.\" That would make one hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand in two and a half years; but in the time\r\npreceding the statement he reported only seven hundred cures.\r\nEvidently very few were helped. However, in Shiloh Tabernacle at Zion\r\nCity are exhibited on the walls crutches, canes, surgical instruments,\r\ntrusses, and almost every form of apparatus used by the medical\r\nprofession, presented by people who have now no further use for them\r\non account of their being healed.[206]\r\n\r\nOur study began with the mental therapeutics of over a millennium\r\nbefore the birth of Christ; let us now close with that of the\r\ntwentieth century after, in giving some account of the so-called\r\nEmmanuel Movement. In 1905 there was formed in connection with\r\nEmmanuel Church, Boston, a tuberculosis class for the alleviation of\r\nunfortunates of this kind. In this experience it was found that\r\ncertain psychic and social factors greatly aided in a cure, and in the\r\nfollowing year, 1906, the work expanded into what has been called the\r\n\"Emmanuel Movement.\" It is an attempt to combine the wisdom and\r\nefforts of the physician, the clergyman, the psychologist, and the\r\nsociologist, to combat conditions most frequently met in a large city.\r\nIn the medical phase of the work mental healing has had a large place,\r\nand has been emphasized most in the popular presentation of the\r\nmovement, and so far as the idea has spread, it has been almost wholly\r\nin connection with this aspect. What the future of this will be is\r\nuncertain, but it seems probable that its most valuable service will\r\nbe in stimulating the physicians to take up the work which properly\r\nbelongs to them--the work of therapeutics in all its branches, mental\r\nand physical.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [190] C.
