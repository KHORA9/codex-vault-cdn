Other times you are supposed to\r\nread the text and then the headings. It really does not matter much as\r\nlong as you read them both. Be sure to do that. They are clever. _I\r\nwrote them myself_.\r\n\r\nI have been accused of trying to catch you coming and going, because I\r\nhave included in my book the right methods of gaining weight, as well as\r\nthose for losing weight. But this is not the reason--though I don't\r\nobject to doing that little thing--the reason is that the lack of\r\nknowledge of foods is the foundation for both overweight and\r\nunderweight.\r\n\r\nI did want my publishers to get this out in a cheaper edition, thinking\r\nthat more people could have it, and thus it would be doing more good;\r\nbut they have convinced me that that idea was a false claim of my mortal\r\nmind, and that the more you paid for it, the more you would appreciate\r\nit. I have received many times, and without grumbling on my part, ten\r\ndollars for the same advice given in my office. Perhaps on this line of\r\nreasoning we should have ten dollars for the book. Those of you who\r\nthink so may send the balance on through my publishers.\r\n\r\nL.H.P.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, California\r\nJune, 1918\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n 1 Preliminary Bout                   11\r\n 2 Key to the Calories                23\r\n 3 Review and More Definitions        30\r\n 4 More Keys and More Calories        37\r\n 5 Vegetarianism vs. Meat Eating      54\r\n 6 The Deluded Ones--My Thin Friends  59\r\n 7 Exercise                           69\r\n 8 At Last!

It will not interest you in the least. I will come to\r\nyou later. I am not particularly interested in you anyway, for I cannot\r\nget your point of view. How any one can want to be anything but thin is\r\nbeyond my intelligence. However, knowing that there are such deluded\r\nindividuals, I have been constrained to give you advice. You won't find\r\nit spontaneous nor from the heart, but if you follow my directions I\r\nwill guarantee that you will gain; providing, of course, you have no\r\norganic trouble; and the chances are that by giving proper attention to\r\nyour diet you will gain anyway, and maybe in passing lose your trouble.\r\nWho knows?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bad Business_]\r\n\r\nIn war time it is a crime to hoard food, and fines and imprisonment have\r\nfollowed the expose of such practices. Yet there are hundreds of\r\nthousands of individuals all over America who are hoarding food, and\r\nthat one of the most precious of all foods! _They have vast amounts of\r\nthis valuable commodity stored away in their own anatomy_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: contents noted]\r\n\r\nNow fat individuals have always been considered a joke, but you are a\r\njoke no longer. Instead of being looked upon with friendly tolerance and\r\namusement, you are now viewed with distrust, suspicion, and even\r\naversion! How dare you hoard fat when our nation needs it? You don't\r\ndare to any longer. You never wanted to be fat anyway, but you did not\r\nknow how to reduce, and it is proverbial how little you eat. Why, there\r\nis Mrs. Natty B. Slymm, who is beautifully thin, and she eats twice as\r\nmuch as you do, and does not gain an ounce. You know positively that\r\neating has nothing to do with it, for one time you dieted, didn't eat a\r\nthing but what the doctor ordered, besides your regular meals, and you\r\nactually gained.\r\n\r\nYou are in despair about being anything but fat, and--! how you hate it.\r\nBut cheer up. I will save you; yea, even as I have saved myself and\r\nmany, many others, so will I save you.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spirituality vs. Materiality_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Long, Long Battle_]\r\n\r\nIt is not in vain that all my life I have had to fight the too, too\r\nsolid. Why, I can remember when I was a child I was always being\r\nconsoled by being told that I would outgrow it, and that when I matured\r\nI would have some shape. Never can I tell pathetically \"when I was\r\nmarried I weighed only one hundred eighteen, and look at me now.\" No, I\r\nwas a delicate slip of one hundred and sixty-five when I was taken.\r\n\r\nI never will tell you how much I have weighed, I am so thoroughly\r\nashamed of it, but my normal weight is one hundred and fifty pounds, and\r\nat one time there was seventy pounds more of me than there is now, or\r\nhas been since I knew how to control it. I was not so shameless as that\r\nvery long, and as I look back upon that short period I feel like\r\nrefunding the comfortable salary received as superintendent of an\r\nhospital; for I know I was only sixty-five per cent efficient, for\r\nefficiency decreases in direct proportion as excess weight increases.\r\nEverybody knows it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Meeting Is Now Open for Discussion_\r\n\r\nJolly Mrs. Sheesasite has the floor and wants some questions answered.\r\nYou know Mrs. Sheesasite; her husband recently bought her a pair of\r\nfreight scales.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mrs. Sheesasite_]\r\n\r\n\"Why is it, Doctor, that thin people can eat so much more than fat\r\npeople and still not gain?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Me Answering_]\r\n\r\n\"First: Thin people are usually more active than fat people and use up\r\ntheir food.\r\n\r\n\"Second: Thin people have been proved to radiate fifty per cent more\r\nheat per pound than fat people; in other words, fat people are regular\r\nfireless cookers! They hold the heat in, it cannot get out through the\r\npacking, and the food which is also contained therein goes merrily on\r\nwith fiendish regularity, depositing itself as fat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fireless Cookers.]\r\n\r\n\"And there are baby fireless cookers and children fireless cookers. The\r\nsame dietetic rules apply to them as to the adult.\"\r\n\r\n\"I recognize Mrs. Tiny Weyaton; then you, Mrs. Knott Little.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mrs. Weyaton_]\r\n\r\n\"We have heard you say that fat people eat too much, and still we eat so\r\nlittle?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Me Again_]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you eat too much, _no matter how little it is_, even if it be only\r\none bird-seed daily, _if you store it away as fat_. For, hearken; food,\r\nand food only (sometimes plus alcohol) maketh fat. Not water--not\r\nair--verily, nothing but food maketh fat. (And between you and me, Mrs.\r\nWeyaton, just confidential like--don't tell it--we know that the small\r\nappetite story is a myth.)\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mrs. Knott Little_]\r\n\r\n\"But, Doctor, is it not true that some individuals inherit the tendency\r\nto be fat, and can not help it, no matter what they do?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Doctor_]\r\n\r\n\"Answer to first part--Yes.\r\n\r\n\"Answer to second part--No! It is not true that they cannot help it;\r\nthey have to work a little harder, that is all. It is true that being\r\nfat is a disease with some, due to imperfect working of the internal\r\nsecretory glands, such as the thyroid, generative glands, etc.; but that\r\nis not true fat such as you have. Yours, and that of the other members\r\nwho are interested, is due to overeating and underexercising.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Not_?]\r\n\r\n\"Those diseased individuals should be under the care of a physician.\r\nProbably the secretory glands are somewhat inactive or sluggish in the\r\nhealthy fat individual. I use the word _healthy_ here in\r\ncontradistinction to the other type. In reality, individuals very much\r\noverweight are not really healthy, and they should also visit their\r\nphysician.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mrs. Ima Gobbler?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mrs. Ima Gobbler_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Doctor Dear_]\r\n\r\n\"But, Doctor dear, what's the use of dieting? I only get fatter after I\r\nstop.\"\r\n\r\n(Answering delicate like, for I'm fond of her and she is sensitive):\r\n\r\n\"You fat--! You make me fatigued! _You never diet long enough_ to get\r\nout of the fireless cooker class. _If you did, you wouldn't.\"_\r\n\r\n\"Is there anyone else who would like to be recognized? No?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nothing That I Don't Know_]\r\n\r\nIt is well. I will probably answer more as I go along, for there is\r\nnothing that I don't know or haven't studied or tried in the reducing\r\nline. I know everything you have to contend with--how you no sooner\r\ncongratulate yourself on your will power, after you have dragged\r\nyourself by the window with an exposure of luscious fat chocolates with\r\ncurlicues on their tummies, than another comes into view, and you have\r\nit all to go through with again, and how you finally succumb.\r\n\r\nI hope sometime it will be a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment, to\r\ndisplay candy as shamelessly as it is done.\r\n\r\nMany fond parents think that candy causes worms. It doesn't, of course,\r\nunless it is contaminated with worm eggs, but, personally, I wish every\r\ntime I ate a chocolate I would get a worm, then I would escape them. The\r\nchocolates, I mean. I will tell you more about worms when I discuss\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Vampires_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Malicious Animal Magnetism?_]\r\n\r\nI know how you go down to destruction for peanuts, with their awful fat\r\ncontent. It is terrible, the lure a peanut has for me. Do you suppose\r\nMr. Darwin could explain that?\r\n\r\nPerhaps I was a little too delicate like in my answer to Mrs. Gobbler's\r\nquestion,--What's the use of dieting, she only gets fatter after she\r\nstops?\r\n\r\nSo many ask me that question, with the further pathetic addition,--Will\r\nthey always have to keep it up? And it ever irritates me.\r\n\r\nThe answer is,--Yes! You will always have to keep up dieting, just as\r\nyou always have to keep up other things in life that make it worth\r\nliving--being neat, being kind, being tender; reading, studying, loving.\r\n\r\nYou will not have to be nearly so strenuous after you get to normal;\r\n_but you might as well recognize now, and accept it as a fact, that\r\nneither you nor anybody else will be able to eat beyond your needs\r\nwithout accumulating fat or disease, or both._\r\n\r\nI love Billy Sunday's classical answer to the objection that his\r\nconversions were not permanent. He responded: \"Neither is a bath!\"\r\n\r\nWHEN YOU START TO REDUCE you will have the following to combat:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Combat_]\r\n\r\nFirst: Your husband, who tells you that he does not like thin women. I\r\nalmost hate my husband when I think how long he kept me under that\r\ndelusion. Now, of course, I know all about his jealous disposition, and\r\nhow he did not want me to be attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Green!_]\r\n\r\nSecond: Your sister, who says, \"Goodness, Lou, but you look old today;\r\nyou looked lots better as you were.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sweet Peace_]\r\n\r\nThird: Your friends, who tell you that you are just right now; don't\r\nlose another pound! And other friends who tell you cheerful tales of\r\npeople they have known who reduced, and who went into a decline, and\r\nfinally died.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _To Avoid Slack in Your Neck, Double and Triple Chins,\r\nMassage Vigorously Up and Down, Not Crossways_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _I Am Interesting_]\r\n\r\nBut you must not mind them. Smile, and tell them that you know all about\r\nit, and don't worry. Go serenely on your way, confident in your heart\r\nthat you will look fully ten years younger when you get down to normal,\r\nno matter how you look in the interim. I don't see why women, and men,\r\ntoo, (secretly) worry so much about wrinkles. If the increased wrinkles\r\non the face are accompanied by increased wrinkles in the gray matter,\r\n'tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. I'm sure I am much more\r\ninteresting with wrinkles than I was without. I am to myself, anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever, you will not be any more wrinkled if you reduce gradually, as I\r\nadvise, and keep up your exercises at least fifteen minutes daily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _I Have a Beautiful Complexion_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _I Attended an Art School Six Months Once_]\r\n\r\nTake care of your face, alternate hot and cold water, glycerine\r\none-quarter, rose water three-quarters, cold cream packs, massage\r\ngently, a little ice--you know what to do--you need not fear. You will\r\nnot only look ten years younger and live twenty years longer--I assert\r\nit boldly--but your complexion and efficiency will be one hundred per\r\ncent better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Joy_!]\r\n\r\nIf there is anything comparable to the joy of taking in your clothes, I\r\nhave not experienced it. And when you find your corset coming closer and\r\ncloser together (I advise a front lace, so this can be watched), and\r\nthen the day you realize that you will have to stitch in a tuck or get a\r\nnew one!\r\n\r\nBut don't be in a hurry to make your clothes smaller now. If they are\r\nloose they will show to the world that you are reducing. A fat person in\r\na tight suit, unless it is perfectly new, should be interned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Food Only_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Impossible_]\r\n\r\nI have said that food, and food only, causes fat. That gives you the cue\r\nto what you must do to get rid of it. No anti-fat medicines unless under\r\nthe supervision of your scientific, educated physician. They are\r\ndangerous; most of them contain thyroid extract, arsenic, or mercury.\r\nEven the vendors of these harmful compounds in their advertisements are\r\nnow saying to \"stop harmful drugging,\" but urge you to adopt their\r\nparticular delightful product, and, \"without dieting or exercises, you\r\nwill positively reduce,\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nNo drastic purges, no violent exercises, especially at first, and not\r\ntoo frequent nor prolonged Turkish baths. Epsom salts baths have little\r\neffect. If salts are used habitually internally, they are harmful. All\r\nof these are unscientific and unsuccessful, and the things they bring on\r\nare worse than the fat.\r\n\r\nNow, if food is the only source of body substance, you see that you must\r\nstudy that question, and that is what I will give you--some lessons on\r\nfoods and their values.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Candy Cake, Pie, Rich Meats, Thick Gravy, Bread, Butter,\r\nNuts, Ice Cream_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Whipped Cream, Candied Sweet Potatoes_]\r\n\r\nHeretofore you have known only in a dumb, despairing sort of way that\r\nall the foods you like are fattening, and all the advice you read and\r\nhear is that you must avoid them as a pestilence. And you settle down to\r\nyour joyless fatness, realizing that it is beyond human strength to do\r\nthat forever, and that you would rather die young and fat, anyway, than\r\nto have nothing to eat all your life but a little meat, fish, and sloshy\r\nvegetables. Study on, and you will find the reason your favorite foods\r\nare fattening.\r\n\r\nBut cast off your dejection. _You don't have to avoid them_!\r\n\r\nEat what you like and grow thin? Yes; follow me. I know it will be an\r\nexertion, but you must persist and go through with it. Nothing in life\r\nworth while is attained without some effort. So begin now; it is the\r\nprice of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Review_\r\n\r\n1. Give rule for normal weight.\r\n\r\n2. How much excess food have you stored away?\r\n\r\n3.

To get the full benefit, Little Book must\r\nbe studied, for it is the only authorized textbook of the \"Watch Your\r\nWeights_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nKey to the Calories\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one page the thin? They come back here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Don't Skip This_]\r\n\r\nDefinition to learn:\r\n\r\nCALORIE; symbol C.; a heat unit and food value unit; is that amount of\r\nheat necessary to raise one pound of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pronounced Kal'-o-ri_]\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of effort expended by many semi-educated\r\nindividuals to discredit the knowledge of calories, saying that it is a\r\nfoolish food science, a fallacy, a fetish, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThey reason, or rather say, that because there are no calories in some\r\nof the very vital elements of foods--the vitamines and the mineral\r\nsalts--therefore it is not necessary to know about them. They further\r\nargue that their grandfathers never heard of calories and they got along\r\nall right. That grandfather argument always enrages my mortal mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Unit of Measure_]\r\n\r\nNow you know that a calorie is a unit of measuring heat and food. It is\r\nnot heat, not food; simply a unit of measure. And as food is of supreme\r\nimportance, certainly a knowledge of how it should be measured is also\r\nof supreme importance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Yes, They Are Kosher_]\r\n\r\nYou should know and also use the word calorie as frequently, or more\r\nfrequently, than you use the words foot, yard, quart, gallon, and so\r\nforth, as measures of length and of liquids. Hereafter you are going to\r\neat calories of food. Instead of saying one slice of bread, or a piece\r\nof pie, you will say 100 Calories of bread, 350 Calories of pie.\r\n\r\nThe following is the way the calorie is determined:\r\n\r\nAn apparatus known as the bomb calorimeter has two chambers, the inner,\r\nwhich contains the dry food to be burned, say a definite amount of\r\nsugar, and an outer, which is filled with water. The food is ignited\r\nwith an electric connection and burned. This heat is transferred to the\r\nwater. When one pound of water is raised 4 degrees Fahrenheit, the\r\namount of heat used is arbitrarily chosen as the unit of heat, and is\r\ncalled the Calorie.\r\n\r\nFood burned (oxydized) in the body has been proved to give off\r\napproximately the same amount of heat or energy as when burned in the\r\ncalorimeter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Approximate Measures_]\r\n\r\n     1 oz. Fat                 = 275 C.\r\n                               --about 255 in the body.\r\n\r\n     1 oz. Protein (dry)       = 120 C.\r\n                               --about 113 in the body.\r\n\r\n     1 oz. Carbohydrates (dry) = 120 C.\r\n                               --about 113 in the body.\r\n\r\n     (ROSE.)\r\n\r\nCan you see now why fats are valuable? Why they make fat more than any\r\nother food? They give off more than two and one-fourth times as much\r\nheat, or energy, as the other foods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _See Next Chapter for Definitions_]\r\n\r\nNotice that protein and carbohydrates have the same food value as to\r\nheat or energy, each 113 Calories to the dry ounce. However, they are\r\nnot interchangeable; that is, carbohydrates will not take the place of\r\nprotein for protein is absolutely necessary to build and repair tissue,\r\nand carbohydrates cannot do that. But fats and carbohydrates are\r\ninterchangeable as fuel or energy foods.\r\n\r\n_Calories Needed per Day for Normal Individuals_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Business of Growing_]\r\n\r\nThis depends upon age, weight, and physical activities; the baby and the\r\ngrowing child needing many more calories per pound per day than the\r\nadult, who has to supply only his energy and repair needs. The aged\r\nrequire still less than the young adult. As to weight; I have told you\r\nwhy overweight individuals need so little. As to physical activities;\r\nthe more active, obviously the more calories needed, for every movement\r\nconsumes calories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Many Know Nothing of This_]\r\n\r\nThe Maine lumbermen, for instance, while working during the winter\r\nmonths, consume from 5000 to 8000 Calories per day.

Multiply normal weight by number of calories needed per pound per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nFor example, say you weigh 220 or 125 lbs., but by the rule for your\r\nheight your weight should be 150 lbs.; then 150 would be the number you\r\nwould use.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Work Out Your Requirements_]\r\n\r\nBy the rule I have given, adults require 15-20 Calories per pound per\r\nday, depending upon activity. For example, if you have no physical\r\nactivities, then take the lowest figure, 15. 150x15--2250. Therefore\r\nyour requirement, if your weight should be 150, is 2250 Calories per\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNow, if you want to lose, cut down 500-1000 Calories per day from that.\r\n\r\nFive hundred Calories equal approximately 2 ounces of fat. Two ounces\r\nper day would be about 4 pounds per month, or 48 pounds per year.\r\nCutting out 1000 Calories per day would equal a reduction of\r\napproximately 8 pounds per month, or 96 pounds per year. These pounds\r\nyou can absolutely lose by having a knowledge of food values (calories)\r\nand regulating your intake accordingly.

For\r\nthose, the Japanese seaweed called agaragar in the laboratory, but more\r\nfamiliarly known as agar by the layman, is excellent.

In general, the caloric value, and therefore the\r\nfattening value, depends upon the amount of fat and the degree of\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Important_]\r\n\r\nBut remember this point: _Any food eaten beyond what your system\r\nrequires for its energy, growth, and repair, is fattening, or is an\r\nirritant, or both_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Moderate Sized Chocolate Cream_]\r\n\r\nIf a food contains much fat, you will know that it is high in food\r\nvalue, for fat has two and one-quarter times the caloric value that\r\nproteins and carbohydrates have. Dry foods are high in value, for they\r\nare concentrated and contain little water. Compare the quantity of two\r\nheaping teaspoonfuls of sugar, a concentrated food, and one and one-half\r\npounds of lettuce, a watery vegetable, each having the same caloric\r\nvalue. A moderate sized chocolate cream is not only concentrated but\r\nhas considerable fat in the chocolate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Enuf Sed_]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to know accurately the caloric values. In fact,\r\nauthorities differ in some of their computations. The list is not\r\nmathematically correct, but it will give you a good idea of the relative\r\nvalues, and is accurate enough for our purposes. I have purposely given\r\nround numbers, where possible, in order to make them more easily\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nIn reckoning made dishes, such as puddings and sauces, you must compute\r\nthe different ingredients approximately. About how much sugar it has,\r\nhow much fat to the dish, and so on.

It is not wholesome\r\nto have many foods at a meal; but the menu should be varied from day to\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAny regimen which does not allow some carbohydrates and fats for the\r\nfuel foods is injurious if persisted in for a length of time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Thoroughly Masticate Everything_]\r\n\r\nAs to harmful combinations; there are not many, and if your food is\r\nthoroughly masticated you need not concern yourself very much about\r\nthem.

But experiments of Chittenden and others have proved that\r\nconsiderably less is sufficient, and that the health is improved if less\r\nis taken.\r\n\r\nChittenden's standard is 50 grams, or 1-2/3 ounces, dry protein\r\n(equivalent to 1/2 pound meat per day). This is considered by many as\r\ninsufficient. A variation from 1-2/3 to 3 ounces dry protein per day\r\nwill give a safe range. (ROSE.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Approx. 240 to 360 C Per Day_]\r\n\r\n_The amount of protein needed is comparatively independent of the amount\r\nof physical exertion_, thus differing from the purely fuel foods,\r\ncarbohydrates and fats, which should vary in direct proportion to the\r\namount of physical exertion. In general, 10 to 15 per cent of the total\r\ncalories per day should be taken as protein. An excess is undoubtedly\r\nirritant to the kidneys, blood vessels, and other organs, and if too\r\nlittle is taken the body tissues will suffer.\r\n\r\nNot all of the protein should be taken in the form of animal protein; at\r\nleast one-half should be taken from the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Animal Flesh Protein_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Necessary?_]\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the chief reasons given by those who object\r\nto its use:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Negative Side_]\r\n\r\nFirst: The animal has just as much right to life, liberty, and pursuit\r\nof happiness as we have.\r\n\r\nSecond: They may be diseased, and there is the possibility of their\r\ncontaining animal parasites, such as tapeworms and trichinae. I would\r\nlike to tell you more about worms, they are so interesting, but He says\r\nnot to try to tell all I know in this little book; that maybe he will\r\nlet me write another sometime, although it is a terrible strain on him,\r\nand that I have given enough of the family history, anyway.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Some Word_]\r\n\r\nThird: The tissues of animals contain excrementitious material, which\r\nmay cause excess acidity, raise the blood pressure, and so forth.\r\n\r\nFourth: More apt to putrefy and thus give ptomaine poisoning.\r\n\r\nFifth: Makes the disposition more vicious.\r\n\r\n(Honest,--animals eating meat exclusively are more vicious.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Affirmative Side_]\r\n\r\nThose who believe that animal protein should be eaten answer these\r\npoints as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst: Survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nSecond: If you give decent support to your health departments they can\r\nfurnish enough inspectors to prevent the marketing of diseased meat; and\r\nif some should slip through, if you thoroughly bake, boil, or fry your\r\nanimal parasites they will lose their pep.\r\n\r\nThird: Most of the harmful products are destroyed by the intestines and\r\nliver.\r\n\r\nFourth: True, but see that you get good meat, and don't eat it in\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nFifth: Unanswerable--to be proved later by personal experiments.\r\n\r\nIn addition, they say that animal protein is more easily digested, that\r\n97 per cent is assimilated because it is animal, and so it is much more\r\nto be desired, especially by children and convalescents; that vegetable\r\nprotein is enclosed in cellulose, and only 65 to 75 per cent is used by\r\nthe system; thus the diet is apt to be too bulky if the proper amount is\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Strong Vegetarians_]\r\n\r\nIt has been proved, however, by several endurance tests, that the\r\nvegetarian contestants had more strength and greater endurance than\r\ntheir meat-eating competitors, so there is no reason why we should be\r\nworried by one or two, or even more, meatless days, especially when\r\nanimal product protein, such as milk, eggs, cheese, and the vegetable\r\nproteins, as in the legumes and the nuts, are available.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Confession_]\r\n\r\nI confess that for quite a while after studying vegetarian books I took\r\na dislike to meat, but now I am in the comfortable state described by\r\nBenjamin Franklin in his autobiography. It seems that he had been\r\nconverted to vegetarianism and had decided that he never again would eat\r\nthe flesh of animals that had been ruthlessly slaughtered, when they so\r\nlittle deserved that fate.\r\n\r\nBut he was exceedingly fond of fish, and while on a fishing party, as\r\nsome fish were being fried, he found they did smell most admirably\r\nwell, and he was greatly torn between his desire and his principle.\r\nFinally he remembered that when the fish were opened he saw some smaller\r\nfish in their stomachs, and he decided that if they could eat each other\r\nhe could eat them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Most Noted Picture of B.

In the first chapter,\r\nyou remember, I said I was not particularly interested in you, but I\r\nhave changed my mind, and I will treat you tenderly and carefully. I\r\nwill have to preach a little bit first, but I don't mind that; I love to\r\nreform people--Yes, you need reforming!\r\n\r\nThe first thing many of you have to do is to learn to accept the trivial\r\nannoyances and small misfits of life as a matter of course, for to give\r\nthem attention _beyond their deserts_ is to wear the web of your life to\r\nthe warp.\r\n\r\nElbert Hubbard never said anything better than that. Have that\r\nreproduced in motto form and put it on your bureau, and repeat it fifty\r\ntimes daily.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Good Philosophy_]\r\n\r\nAdopt my philosophy. If I have a trivial annoyance I analyze it\r\ncarefully. Was I to blame? Yes? All right, I am glad, because then I can\r\nsee that it will not happen again, so I stop worrying. If I am not to\r\nblame, if I could not help it in the least, well, then I don't worry\r\nabout it, for that will not help it any, and I wasn't to blame! If it\r\nbobs up in my mind again, I say: \"Now, look here, you annoyance, I have\r\ngiven you all the attention you deserve; avaunt, depart, get out!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Simple_]\r\n\r\nNow, how is this philosophy going to help you gain?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lost Calories_]\r\n\r\nWhen you worry needlessly, notice how tense your muscles are. You are\r\nexercising them all of the time and using hundreds of calories of\r\nenergy. You raise your blood pressure, the internal secretory glands may\r\noveract (re-read what I have said about these glands in the fat\r\npeople), and thus many more calories are used. The intestinal secretions\r\ndo not flow so freely, you have indigestion and do not assimilate your\r\nfood, and thus hundreds more calories are lost.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is impossible to gain unless your food is assimilated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Develop Poise_]\r\n\r\nSo the first thing you have to learn is this mental control and to\r\nrelax. Remember that word, relax. After you are better nourished your\r\nnervous system will not be on hair-trigger tension, and it will be\r\neasier for you.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _No Pain In Matter; No Matter In Pain Why Worry?_]\r\n\r\nIf you are ill in mind or body, remember that it is natural to be well,\r\nand that within your body nature has stored the most wonderful forces\r\nwhich are always tending towards the normal, or health, if not\r\nobstructed or hindered.\r\n\r\nNature sometimes needs help to stimulate those forces, or to reinforce\r\nthem, or to remove obstructions. This is where the physician comes in.\r\nBut you yourself can aid nature the most by realizing that _nature is\r\nhealth and it is normal to be well_. By so doing, all of your organs\r\nfunction better and you are restored to normal more rapidly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sleep_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fresh Air_]\r\n\r\nSecond: It is very important to have enough sleep. Dr. Richard Cabot\r\nsays that probably resistance is lowered as much by lack of sufficient\r\nsleep as by any other factor, and that all you can soak into your system\r\nin twenty-four hours is not too much. Don't forget the fresh air.\r\n\r\nYou generally suffer from sleeplessness, I believe. The overweights are\r\nalways advised not to sleep too much. They will find while reducing that\r\nthey won't want to sleep so much, anyway. They will like to stay\r\nawake--they feel so much happier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sometimes_]\r\n\r\nNow, when you retire and try to sleep but cannot, try this--it works\r\nwith me. You know when you are passing over your mental images become\r\ndistorted and grotesque. I artificially induce that state. If I find\r\nmyself rehearsing about two hundred times, with appropriate gestures,\r\nthe keen, witty, logical remarks which I could have made in favor of my\r\npet legislation in the club discussion, but didn't, then I begin after\r\nthis fashion:\r\n\r\nPink elephants with green ribbons on their tails--red rhinoceri (is that\r\nright, or should it be rhinoceroses?)--smiling peanuts--Woman's City\r\nClub--Social Health Insurance--why didn't I say--I wish I had\r\nsaid--(here get out, you annoyance!)--pink elephants--and so forth and\r\nso forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Picture of Pink Elephant Adorned_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Woe Is Me_]\r\n\r\nNow I realize I have ruined myself. I am my own worst enemy. I have\r\nexposed my whole life before those modern vivisectionists, the army of\r\namateur psycho-analysts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Exercise_]\r\n\r\nThird: Exercise. Great muscular exertion should be avoided, but the\r\nsetting-up exercises that I advise, if begun with moderation and\r\nincreased gradually, will undoubtedly stimulate the appetite and help\r\nthe body functions to be better performed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Food_]\r\n\r\nFourth: Since food is the only source of body substance, you must\r\ngradually train your stomach so that it can care for enough food to not\r\nonly supply your bodily energy, but to leave a little excess to be\r\nstored as fat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Your Stomach_]\r\n\r\nIf you have a small appetite--and many of you have--your stomach is\r\nundoubtedly contracted, and you must gradually add to the amount you\r\nhave been eating, even though it may cause some distress, until you have\r\ndisciplined it so that it can handle what you need without distress. The\r\nstomach is a muscular organ and can be trained and exercised somewhat as\r\nother organs can. You will not have much appetite at first, but it will\r\ndevelop. Sometimes a short fast for a day or two, drinking nothing but\r\npure water, seems to be beneficial in the beginning.\r\n\r\nDo not drink much with your meals, unless the drink has food value by\r\nthe addition of lots of cream or sugar, or both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Eat More_]\r\n\r\nDecide how many calories you need for your activities, gradually add to\r\nyour dietary until you have reached that number, and then some more, and\r\nyou will gain as surely as the overweight individual will lose by doing\r\nthe opposite. It may take a long time, or you may get results very\r\nrapidly, depending somewhat upon the individual characteristics.\r\nGradually increase your butter, cream, sugar, chocolate, and so forth,\r\nas they are very high in food value.\r\n\r\nStudy the Key to the Calories and reckon your calories every day for a\r\nwhile. You have already noticed that the foods that you like are low in\r\nfood value.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the things you can take to add to your fuel:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Try Some of These_]\r\n\r\nA glass of milk, hot or cold, taken between meals and before retiring,\r\nwill add about 500 calories.\r\n\r\nCream sauce on your vegetables will add to their value.\r\n\r\nCod liver oil, or olive oil, or cream, begun in small doses and\r\ngradually increased.\r\n\r\nOne malted milk, made with milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream,\r\nand the malted milk, will add about 500 calories.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Learned Phraseology_]\r\n\r\nYou remember the painful time that I spoke of when there was so much\r\nmore of me than there ought to be? Well, the aforesaid concoction, made\r\nwith milk, syrup, egg, ice cream, whipped cream, and the malted milk,\r\nwas accessory before the fact, and also particeps criminis before the\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI absorbed this phraseology by being president of the Professional\r\nWoman's Club, with its high-class women attorneys, ministers, dentists,\r\nPh.D.'s, and \"Medical Trust\" doctors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Explanatory Note 1_]\r\n\r\n\"Medical Trust.\"--The American Medical Association (A.M.A.), a powerful\r\ntrust you can't get into unless you have a high preliminary education\r\nand are a graduate of a high-class medical college.

Make out\r\nyour own menus, realizing that you must work gradually to the desired\r\namount.\r\n\r\nI am taking it for granted that you are organically sound, that your\r\nscientific, educated physician has said there is nothing the matter with\r\nyou, except perhaps your \"nervous\" disposition.\r\n\r\nHave I not been nice to you? All right, relax and watch yourself get\r\ninto the class of the plumptically adequate.\r\n\r\nAnd if you don't succeed after a faithful trial, take the milk-cure,\r\nwith its three to six weeks' absolute rest.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation_\r\n\r\n     1. Calm yourself.\r\n     2. Sleep.\r\n     3. Exercise.\r\n     4. Food.\r\n     5. Masticate\r\n     6. Delete the details.\r\n     7. Milk-cure.\r\n\r\n_Review_\r\n\r\n     1. Repeat Elbert Hubbard's advice.\r\n     2. Give three reasons why worry can make\r\n     you thin.\r\n     3. Define \"Medical Trust\" and \"League\r\n     for Medical Freedom.\"\r\n     4. Memorize paragraph about nature\r\n     5. Enumerate the things you can eat to\r\n     increase your calories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nExercise\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is practically impossible to reduce weight through exercise alone,\r\nunless one can do a tremendous amount of it. For the food that one eats\r\nis usually enough to cover the energy lost by the exercise.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Light On Your Feet_]\r\n\r\nHowever, exercise is a very important feature of any reducing program;\r\nnot because of the fat that is burned up in the exercise--and there is\r\nsome burned--but for the reason that it is necessary to keep one in a\r\nhealthy condition. The muscles, the internal organs, the bones, the\r\nbrain, are all benefited--in fact, the entire system.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Duty Dances_]\r\n\r\nThe exercises described hereinafter will help make you fat or thin, and\r\nthey will keep you supple, graceful, and light on your feet, so that\r\nwhen I tell my husband that he must dance with you, Madam, he will not\r\nsay, \"Nothing stirring,\" and when you, Professor, ask me to dance, I\r\nwill not curse the day I was born.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Warning_]\r\n\r\nIf you have not been accustomed to exercise, I warn you to take up only\r\none or two at a time and do each one a few times only. You will be\r\natrociously sore, and you will realize that you have muscles of which\r\nyou wotted not.\r\n\r\nHowever, persist, if you are sure there are no organic reasons why you\r\nshouldn't--such as a weak heart. (In case you are very much overweight,\r\nI think it advisable to wait until you have reduced somewhat.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Or Classic Dancing_]\r\n\r\nIt is splendid if you can belong to a gymnasium or to a physical culture\r\nclass, but ten to fifteen minutes' systematic daily exercise practiced\r\nwith vim, and each set followed by deep breathing, will do more good\r\nthan a gymnasium spasmodically attended. Brisk walking with a long\r\nstride isn't so bad; in fact, if taken with a very long stride it will\r\ntwist 'most every organ you have in your body.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of exercises you can take. If you will notice little\r\nrascal's illustrations you will find many good ones. Those illustrating\r\nthe beginning of this chapter are excellent.\r\n\r\nIf possible, it is best to take the exercises on arising in the morning,\r\nbut if you have a household to care for you may not be able to do so.\r\nFor those who have to do their own work, it may be well to do the work\r\nfirst. You can do it in half the time if you plan it carefully and speed\r\nup. (This advice is not for my thin friends; their speedometers register\r\ntoo high already.) It does not matter so much when the exercises are\r\ndone as that they are done, and done every day for the rest of your\r\nlife, with the possible exception of two or three days a month.\r\n\r\nGallstones, permanent stiff joints, and other little things like that\r\nwill have a hard time forming.\r\n\r\n_My Exercises_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _They Reach Most of My Muscles_]\r\n\r\n(The services of my noted artist I was able to obtain with great\r\ndifficulty, as he was engaged in the more important work of making a\r\nswagger stick. I finally secured him by the promise of an ice cream cone\r\nand twenty-three cents to go with his two cents so that he could buy a\r\nThrift Stamp. He is given due credit on the title page.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Turn On Your Music_]\r\n\r\nThese exercises executed with vim, vigor, and vip--deep breathing\r\nbetween each set--will take ten to fifteen minutes. Re-read my warning.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Little Movements with Meanings All Their Own_]\r\n\r\n1. Feet together, arms outstretched, palms up, describe as large a\r\ncircle as possible. Fine for round shoulders and fat backs. Do slowly\r\nand stretch fifteen times. Smile.\r\n\r\n2. Arms outstretched, swing to right and to left as far as possible at\r\nleast 15 times each.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Important! Keep Facial Expression Throughout as per\r\nArtist's Idea_]\r\n\r\n3. Bend sideways, to right and left, alternately, as far as possible at\r\nleast 15 times each.\r\n\r\n4. Revolve the body upon the hips from right to left at least 10 times,\r\nand left to right the same.\r\n\r\n5. Bend and touch the floor with your fingers, without bending your\r\nknees, at least 15 times.\r\n\r\n6. Knee-bending exercise, at least 15 times. This is hard at first.\r\n\r\n7. Hand on door or wall, swing each leg back and forth at least 15\r\ntimes. To the side 15 times. Turn head, raise arm, and tense both.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _You Will Soon Be as Graceful as Annette_]\r\n\r\n8. Step on chair with each foot at least 10 times. This is good for calf\r\nand thigh muscles. After a while you won't look as though you needed a\r\nderrick to get onto a street car.\r\n\r\n9. Arms on sides of chair. Come down and touch abdomen. Fine for back\r\nand abdomen. Fifteen times.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _It Has Been Called to My Attention that Bone Back Brushes\r\nShould Not Be Used by Some; i.e., There Is Danger in Affinities_]\r\n\r\n10. Brush hair vigorously at least 200 double strokes all over the head,\r\nN.S.E.W., using a brush in each hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Good Exercise_]\r\n\r\n(Military brushes are best. If you can't purloin a set of your\r\nhusband's, two ordinary brushes will do.) Now shake out the loose\r\ndandruff. This is one of the best exercises and must not be omitted, for\r\nit accomplishes two purposes. It is a good arm and chest exercise, and\r\nit gives a healthy scalp absolutely free from the dammdruff.\r\n\r\nNOW\r\n\r\nThis for a few minutes, followed by this, the hot preferably at night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nAt Last! How to Reduce\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title of this chapter indicates to whom it is addressed. All others\r\nplease refrain from reading, for it is strictly private and\r\nconfidential, and is intended only for those who need it.\r\n\r\nYou thin and you normal had better save it, though, for you may qualify\r\nlater. You are keeping right on reading now! I'm surprised. I wanted to\r\ntell my fat friends that the first thing they have to do is to get\r\ncontrol of their will power, and now I can't do it.\r\n\r\nSomehow, will power with a layer of fat on it gets feeble. Don't laugh,\r\nyou too thin! It gets worse than feeble, if there is no fat at all and\r\nthe nervous system is starved, it--well, I won't say what it does, for I\r\ndon't want to worry you.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Now That Order Is Restored I Will Resume_]\r\n\r\nWill power, being feeble to a greater or less degree, must be bolstered\r\nand aided a bit, to begin with, so--\r\n\r\n_First Order_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Watch Your Weight!_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Nature Always Counts_]\r\n\r\nTell loudly and frequently to all your friends that you realize that it\r\nis unpatriotic to be fat while many thousands are starving, that you are\r\ngoing to reduce to normal, and will be there in the allotted time. If\r\nyou belong to a club, round up the overweights and form a section. Call\r\nit the \"Watch Your Weight--Anti-Kaiser Class.\" Tax the members\r\nsufficiently to buy a good, accurate pair of scales. Meet once a week to\r\nweigh. Wear approximately the same weight clothes, and weigh at the same\r\ntime in relation to eating. Do this whether or not you belong to a club.\r\nOnce or twice a week is often enough to weigh. Scales vary, so try to\r\nuse the same ones.\r\n\r\nDon't be discouraged if some day after you have dieted well you seem to\r\nhave gained. Nature sometimes seems fiendish that way. The excess weight\r\nis probably due to a retention of water, and will not be permanent.\r\nHowever, don't depend upon this too often! Usually, if you have gained\r\nwhen you think you ought not to, it is because Nature has been counting\r\ncalories and you haven't.\r\n\r\nHave the members listed on a weight chart conspicuously placed near the\r\nscales, and record accurately the weight weekly.\r\n\r\n     +-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n     |            WATCH YOUR WEIGHT ANTI-KAISER CLASS        |\r\n     +-------------------------------------------------------+\r\n     |                  |Normal|          Weight on          |\r\n     +------------------+------+-----------------------------+\r\n     |  Members' Names  |Weight|Date|Date|Date|Date|Date|Date|\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n     |                  |      |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n     |                  |      |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n     |                  |      |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n     |                  |      |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n     |                  |      |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n     +------------------+------+----+----+----+----+----+----+\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _No Funds for the Red Cross_]\r\n\r\nThose not reducing at least one pound per week to be fined soundly and\r\nthe proceeds given to the Red Cross. That won't be a good way to raise\r\nfunds for the chapter, though, for there will be no fines after the\r\nfirst week or so, when the members find what their maintenance diet\r\nshould be and are consuming less than that.\r\n\r\nI will explain this maintenance diet business. You shameless thin ones,\r\ncall back your more polite comrades--this is important for all of you.\r\n(I shall also tell you more fully about this in the last chapter.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Maintenance Diet_]\r\n\r\nThe maintenance diet is one which maintains you at your present weight,\r\n_i.e.,_ you are not gaining or losing. You may be over or under normal,\r\nbut are staying there. The intake equals the outgo.\r\n\r\nWhen you eat less than your maintenance diet, you are going to supply\r\nthe deficiency with your own fat.\r\n\r\nSo commit yourself on your honor that you are going to reduce or\r\nperish--no joke; you can't tell how near you are to it if you are much\r\noverweight. There are two general stages of fatty heart. In the first\r\nstage the heart is surrounded by a blanket of fat, and it also\r\npenetrates between the muscles. Later, if it goes on too long, the heart\r\nmuscle itself degenerates to fat, then--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Good-night!_]\r\n\r\nShakespeare warns you to make thy body less, hence thy grace more; leave\r\ngormandizing, and know that the grave doth gape for thee thrice wider\r\nthan for other men.\r\n\r\n_Second Order_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Shrink Your Stomach_]\r\n\r\nYour stomach, long used to an excess of food for your needs--it may not\r\nbe a large amount--but still, I repeat, being used to an excess of food\r\nfor your needs, your stomach must be disciplined. It is undoubtedly\r\ndistended, as it should not be.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Shrink Your Stomach_]\r\n\r\nA good way to show it that you are master is to fast for at least one\r\nday--drink nothing but pure water, hot or cold, as you prefer. It will\r\nprotest vociferously and will tell all its friends, the different organs\r\nof your body, how you are persecuting it, and they will join the league\r\nagainst you and decide they will oust you from your position, and you\r\nwill feel like--but don't mind it; it will soon know that you mean\r\nbusiness, and, much chastened and considerably contracted, will take the\r\nnext day a very small amount of food very gratefully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Shrink Your Stomach_]\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to be so severe with it you can allow it five glasses\r\nof hot or cold skim milk or buttermilk, one every three hours, say, at\r\n10,1,4,7, and 10 o'clock. One glass is 80 calories, five equal 400\r\ncalories, which is not so much.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Or Mashed_]\r\n\r\nThe baked potato and glass of skim milk diet, three times a day one day\r\na week, which has its devotees, depends upon its low caloric content for\r\nits results. There is no magic in it, no yeast business which reduces.\r\nThis is most wholesome, however, for potatoes contain a large amount of\r\nthe potassium salts, which tend to counteract the effects of uric acid,\r\nand thus are good for the gouty type.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mono-Diets_]\r\n\r\nThe beefsteak, the milk, and the fruit diets are also good. One can gain\r\nas well as lose on the milk diet, all depending on number of calories\r\nconsumed, and it is an excellent method for both. The beefsteak diet is\r\nbeneficial for a short time, but too much protein over a long period has\r\nbeen shown to be harmful. An exclusive fruit diet is excellent for\r\nreduction.\r\n\r\nLow calorie days can be repeated once a week if necessary in order to\r\nkeep the stomach in good order. Fruit juice, one-quarter glass, or fresh\r\nfruit, can be substituted for the skim milk, and you may prefer it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _But You Do Not Have To_]\r\n\r\nYou could keep on this for some time, or fast for some time, and\r\nprobably be much benefited. I fasted five days once, or rather\r\nfruit-juiced five days. I lost about ten pounds, I think, and my heart,\r\nwhich had begun to carry on, was relieved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sob Stuff_]\r\n\r\nIt was during that period of which I have spoken, and of which I am\r\nashamed; for I had my M.D. degree then and should have known better. But\r\nyou know we have good authority that it is easier to teach twenty what\r\nwere good to be done than to be one of twenty to follow our own\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Third Order_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _You Are Down to Business_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _And Maybe Diabetes_]\r\n\r\nNow you will have to reckon on the amount of food or number of calories\r\nyou need per day. Review the rule I have given. You find for your age\r\nand _normal weight_ that you will need, let us say for example, 2200\r\ncalories. You have probably been consuming twice that amount and either\r\nstoring it away as fat or as disease. (It is surprising how small an\r\nexcess will gradually add up pounds of fat. For instance, three pats of\r\nbutter or three medium chocolate creams a day, if over the maintenance\r\nlimit, would add approximately _27 pounds a year_ to your weight!)\r\n\r\nNow you are to reduce your maintenance diet--the 2200 calories we are\r\ntaking for example--to 1200 calories--quite a comfortable lot, you will\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nYou will be surprised how much 1200 calories will be if the food is\r\njudiciously selected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _After All, Hunger Is Much More Agreeable Than Apoplexy_]\r\n\r\nYou may be hungry at first, but you will soon become accustomed to the\r\nchange. I find that dry lemon or orange peel, or those little aromatic\r\nbreath sweeteners, just a tiny bit, seem to stop the hunger pangs; or\r\nyou may have a cup of fat-free bouillon or half an apple, or other low\r\ncalorie food. (Count the calories here.)\r\n\r\nOne thousand calories less food per day equals four ounces of fat lost\r\ndaily--approximately 8 pounds per month. If you do not want to lose so\r\nfast, do not cut down so much.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fourth Order_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _You Register Joy_]\r\n\r\nYou may eat just what you like--candy, pie, cake, fat meat, butter,\r\ncream--but--_count your calories!_ You can't have many nor large\r\nhelpings, you see; but isn't it comforting to know that you can eat\r\nthese things? Maybe some meal you would rather have a 350-calorie piece\r\nof luscious pie, with a delicious 150-calorie tablespoonful of whipped\r\ncream on it, than all the succulent vegetables Luther Burbank could\r\ngrow in California.\r\n\r\nMy idea of heaven is a place with me and mine on a cloud of whipped\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _You Registered Too High_]\r\n\r\nNow that you know you can have the things you like, proceed to make your\r\nmenus containing very little of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fifth Order_\r\n\r\nThis is going to be your chief business and pursuit in life for the next\r\nfew months, this reducing of your weight. However, keep up your Red\r\nCross and all other activities, fast and furiously, so that you won't be\r\nthinking about yourself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _More Warnings_]\r\n\r\nDon't reduce more than two or three pounds a week; two or less is\r\nbetter. If you are too cannibalistic, your heart, kidneys and nervous\r\nsystem are liable to suffer--you yourself are supplying too much fat in\r\nyour dietary, and there are other scientific reasons against reducing\r\ntoo rapidly.\r\n\r\nHowever, you may find that the first week or so you may reduce five or\r\nseven pounds; but don't worry about this, for that is a slushy, watery\r\nfat that goes easily.\r\n\r\nIf a claim like a cold should attack you, and after spraying nose and\r\nthroat frequently with an antiseptic, and then denying the claim\r\nvigorously, it persists in running a severe course, better go back to\r\nmaintenance diet for a few days.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Not Even While Cooking_]\r\n\r\n_Don't \"taste\"!_ You will find the second taste much harder to resist\r\nthan the first. If you have allowed in your daily program something\r\nbetween meals (a good plan), take it, but not otherwise.\r\n\r\nTry not to overeat at any time, and thus undo the work that perhaps has\r\ntaken you two or three days to accomplish. It will be all right\r\noccasionally, possibly one day a week, to eat up to your maintenance\r\ndiet, but don't, I beg of you, go over it so that you will gain.\r\n\r\nYou will be tempted quite frequently, and you will have to choose\r\nwhether you will enjoy yourself hugely in the twenty minutes or so that\r\nyou will be consuming the excess calories, or whether you will dislike\r\nyourself cordially for the two or three days you lose by your lack of\r\nwill power.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _I Ought Not to Do This_]\r\n\r\nI am afraid I am going to tell a story. I feel as though I were, and I\r\ndon't want to. It is one I heard years ago at a teachers' convention at\r\nRiverside, when I was a tender, unsuspecting young school teacher, so\r\nit is perfectly good, albeit senile--and it illustrates my point so\r\nwell--so well--well, you have to put yourself in the place of the little\r\nchaps, Billie and Johnnie, of the kindergarten.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Little Anatomical Story_]\r\n\r\nIt seems it was customary to bring a lunch, and Little-new-boy had come\r\nwithout one. Teacher asked Billie would he share? No, sturdily; not he.\r\nBut little Johnnie, he would. Some time later, Johnnie, with a frantic\r\nwaving of his hand, and with just pride in his generosity, informed the\r\nclass that he had shared his lunch with Little-new-boy and he felt good\r\nis his little heart.\r\n\r\nBillie stood his ground and stoutly declared that he ate his and he felt\r\ngood in his little belly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nAutobiographical\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not give our thin friends a sample menu for fear it would upset\r\nthem; but nothing can upset your digestion, I know. However, I will not\r\ngive you a sample menu, either, but will tell you what I eat when I go\r\non a reduction regime, which for me is 1200 Calories.\r\n\r\nYou will notice, most of my calories I have at dinner in the evening.\r\nYou may not like this, but would rather have yours spread over the\r\nentire day; and you can suit your fancy, for it makes no difference as\r\nlong as your total number per day stays within your reduction limit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Make Out Several Menus if You Like_]\r\n\r\nDon't think you have to follow my menu. You might gain on it! Study the\r\nKey and select your own.\r\n\r\nMany will lose by going on the no-breakfast plan, or the no-lunch plan.\r\nIf they do reduce, it is because they have lowered their daily\r\nconsumption of food, and not because of the no-breakfast or no-lunch\r\nplan _per se._\r\n\r\nFat seems to melt faster when the chief meal is in the middle of the\r\nday, and with only 200 or 300 calories of fruit for the evening meal. In\r\nthis way you slim while you sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n     1 slice very dry coarse bread toast\r\n       1/4 in. thick                            50 C.\r\n     Butter, 1/4 cu. in                         25 C.\r\n     Hot water flavored with coffee             00 C.\r\n                                                -----\r\n         Total                                  75 C.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Slim While You Sleep! Clever?_]\r\n\r\nYou may prefer many more calories for breakfast, or none at all. This\r\nmay not look good to you, but it means an awful lot in my young life,\r\nafter my exercise and bath, to sit down to my little breakfast and read\r\nthe papers.\r\n\r\nRecently I have found that two cups of moderately hot water with the\r\njuice of a lemon answers just as well as the toast and watery coffee,\r\nand is probably better. You might like some fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LUNCHEON\r\n\r\n     1 corn muffin--I am patriotic             125 C.\r\n     1 pat butter                              100 C.\r\n     1 cup coffee with 1 tbsp. cream            50 C.\r\n                                               ------\r\n         Total                                 275 C.\r\n\r\nIf you are patriotic and constipated, substitute one bran muffin. You\r\ncan see that this is in reality a further extension of my sumptuous\r\nbreakfast.

Take a moderate mouthful and rassel with it until it is\r\nautomatically swallowed. Chew until it is all gone before you put any\r\nmore in your mouth. There is no better way of jollying yourself into\r\nthinking that you have had all you want than this Fletcherizing habit,\r\nand it takes the same time to consume one-half the amount of food you\r\nhave been in the habit of eating.\r\n\r\nI will allow you all the water you want, in reason; in fact, I advise it\r\nwhile you are reducing, both at the meals and between meals. The only\r\nprecaution is that at the meals it should not be drunk while food is in\r\nthe mouth, for this would tend to lessen thorough mastication.\r\n\r\nNow, Madam and Madam's husband, when are you going to begin this\r\nimportant business of reducing?

There is a great deal of psychology to reducing. Use\r\nstrong auto-suggestion. Decide just how much you are going to eat in\r\nadvance of the meal--so many calories, _no more!_ This sounds foolish,\r\nbut it helps wonderfully.\r\n\r\nSecond: Begin with a fast or a low caloric diet for the first day; keep\r\nit, if necessary, one day weekly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Low Bridge on Fats and Pastries_]\r\n\r\nThird: Study food list and make out menus the caloric totals of which\r\n_are less_ than your maintenance diet. Have a fairly balanced diet, some\r\nfat, some carbohydrates, some protein, and a good amount of green\r\nvegetables and fruit. _Have 200-300 C's of protein._\r\n\r\nFourth: Masticate every morsel with such thoroughness that it is\r\nautomatically swallowed.\r\n\r\nFifth: Keep up your activities--Red Cross and other relief work.\r\n\r\nSixth: Remember that you will feel good in your little heart when you\r\nresist temptation to overeat, and when you don't, you won't feel good\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nSeventh: Some vigorous exercise every day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _There Is Life Substance and Intelligence in Chocolate\r\nCreams!_]\r\n\r\nNOTE: If there comes a time when you think you will die unless you have\r\nsome chocolate creams, go on a c.c. debauch.

It may be your\r\nweight is too much or too little, but this is your maintenance diet for\r\nthat weight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _2nd Circle_]\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND circle represents a daily diet containing more than necessary\r\nfor maintenance; for example, let us say 1000 calories more. This 1000\r\ncalories of food is equivalent to approximately 4 ounces of fat\r\n[1000/255 (1 oz. fat = 255 C.)]; 4 ounces of fat daily equals 8 pounds a\r\nmonth which will be added to your weight, and, if not needed by the\r\nsystem, will deposit itself as excess fat.\r\n\r\nOr the toxins arising from the unnecessary food will irritate the blood\r\nvessels, causing arterio-sclerosis (hardening of the arteries), which in\r\nturn may cause kidney disease, heart disease, or apoplexy (rupture of\r\nartery in the brain), and maybe death before your time.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you are underweight and the added nourishment is\r\ngradually worked up to, it will improve the health and cause a gain of\r\nso much (theoretically, and in reality if kept up long enough).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _3d Circle_]\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD circle represents a diet containing less than the maintenance;\r\nagain, for example, say 1000 calories less. Here the 1000 calories must\r\nbe taken from the body tissue, and fat is the first to go, for fat is\r\nvirtually dead tissue.\r\n\r\nThis 4 ounces of fat daily which will be supplied by your body equals in\r\nsix months 48 pounds.\r\n\r\nThere are in America hundreds of thousands of overweight individuals;\r\nnot all so much overweight as this, but some considerably more so. If\r\nthese individuals will save 1000 calories of food daily by using their\r\nstored fat, think what it would mean at this time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Savings_]\r\n\r\nNot only an immense saving of food to be sent to our soldiers and allies\r\nand the starving civilians, and of money which could be used for Liberty\r\nBonds, the Red Cross, and other war relief work, but a great saving and\r\na great increase in power; for there is no doubt that by reducing as\r\nslowly and scientifically as I have directed, efficiency and health will\r\nbe increased one hundred fold.\r\n\r\nIf, as illustrated in the third circle, the 1000 calories or less is\r\neaten and the individual already is underweight, with no excess fat,\r\nthen this amount will be taken from the muscles and the more vital\r\ntissues, and the organism will finally succumb. Before this time is\r\nreached there will be a great lowering of resistance, and the individual\r\nwill be a prey to the infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that in children the growth of the whole body is\r\ntremendously active, and especially that of the heart and nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIf the nervous system is undernourished, it becomes disorganized and\r\nundeveloped. This is apt to be expressed in uncertain emotional states,\r\nquick tempers, and a predisposition to convulsions. The heart, if\r\nundernourished, lays its foundation for future heart disease, and the\r\nwhole system will be injured for life.\r\n\r\nAnything that impairs the vigor and vitality of children strikes at the\r\nbasis of national welfare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Food Administration Emphasizes This_]\r\n\r\nYou can see from this how extremely important it is that, in our need\r\nfor the conservation of food, only those who can deny themselves and at\r\nthe same time improve their health and efficiently should do it. It will\r\nbe no help in our crisis if the health and resistance of our people be\r\nlowered and the growth and development of our children be stunted.\r\n\r\nWe, the hundreds of thousands of overweight citizens, combined with the\r\nhundreds of thousands of the normal who are overeating to their ill, can\r\nsave all the food that is necessary. We are anxious, willing, eager to\r\ndo this. Now we know how, and we will.\r\n\r\n_Food Will Win the War_\r\n\r\nWATCH OUR WEIGHT!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nThree Years Later\r\n\r\n_February, 1, 1921_\r\n\r\nAn Added Chapter in Which Are Offered Twenty-one Suggestive Menus\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter nearly two years with the American Red Cross in the Balkans I\r\nreturn to find the little book has been carrying on in my absence--I\r\nwrite this for the fifth edition--and my publishers insisting that I\r\nmust furnish some more menus. They affirm that there are many who do not\r\ncare to or cannot figure out their own.\r\n\r\nAfter being so long under military discipline I obey now instinctively,\r\nalthough I do not want to do this. But you know publishers. They say\r\nthat if there are menus for those who do not have the desire to compute\r\nthem, the usefulness of the book will be increased. Publishers are so\r\naltruistic.\r\n\r\nNow far be it from me to scorn the possibility of increased sales\r\nmyself. So I comply, and after you are reduced you will have the energy\r\nand the increased keenness to scout around in the calories and make out\r\nyour own.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA little of my Balkan experience in the reducing line may not be amiss.\r\nIn Albania, where I was stationed most of the time, life is very\r\nstrenuous. We all had to work hard and expend a great deal of nervous\r\nenergy. Medical calls on foot in the scorching sun over unkind\r\ncobblestones, long distance calls on unkinder mules, long hours in\r\nnerve-racking clinics, ferocious man-eating mosquitos, scorpions,\r\ncentipedes, sandflies, and fleas, and other unspeakable animals kept us\r\nhopping and slapping and scratching.\r\n\r\nBut there was one consolation to me. With this work, more intensive and\r\nmore strenuous than I had ever done before, I would not have to diet--I\r\nwould not have to watch my weight--I would not have to count my\r\ncalories! Oh, joy!\r\n\r\nWe lived a community life, we Red Crossers. We had plain blunt food,\r\nAmerican canned mostly, supplemented with the fare that could be eked\r\nout of Albania, and cooked by an Albanese who could not be taught that\r\nwe Americans were not Esquimos and did not like food swimming in fat.\r\nHowever, it tasted good to famished Red Crossers, and I ate three meals\r\na day, confident that I would retain my girlish middle-aged slenderness\r\nand not have to diet. We had no scales and no mirrors larger than our\r\nhand mirrors. Our uniforms were big and comfortable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe French who are in charge of Scutari depart, the officers leaving to\r\nus some of their furniture, including a full length French plate mirror.\r\nOrdinarily when I look in a full-length mirror I don't hate myself so\r\nmuch--so it is with some degree of anticipated pleasure that I\r\ncomplacently approach, to get a life-size reflection of myself after\r\nmany months of deprivation of that pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" I exclaim. \"_Bogomi_!\" (Serbian--'For the love of Allah!')\r\n\"This is no mirror,\" I mutter. \"This is one of those musee things that\r\nmake you look like a Tony Sarg picture of Irvin Cobb.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's irritating you, Dockie?\" asks one of the girls, coming up and\r\nstanding back of me. I look at her reflection. She does not look like\r\nIrvin Cobb!\r\n\r\n\"Peggy,\" I say tragically, \"Peggy, do I look like my reflection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear, we have all noticed how stout you have been getting. Aren't\r\nyou supposed to be some shark on the subject of ideal weight?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the bitter truth is borne in upon me--no matter how hard I work--no\r\nmatter how much I exercise, no matter what I suffer, I will always have\r\nto watch my weight, I will always have to count my calories.\r\n\r\nThis is what I did then:\r\n\r\nI stopped going to the breakfast table. I kept some canned milk and\r\ncoffee in my room, and made me two cups of coffee. For lunch I ate\r\npractically what I wanted, limiting myself to one slice of bread or one\r\npotato (we had no butter), with fruit for dessert. For dinner I came\r\ndown only when the dessert was being served, and had a share of that\r\nwith some coffee. I was jeered and derided. You know how in community\r\nlife we all are as disagreeable as we like, and still love each other.\r\nDid not I know the desserts were the most fattening part of the meal? I\r\nwas some authority on how to reduce, I was!\r\n\r\nIn vain I told them that it did not matter so long as my total caloric\r\nintake did not equal the number that I needed. It was not until some\r\nmonths after, when they saw that I was normal weight again, that they\r\nbegan to realize I knew whereof I spoke.\r\n\r\nThen came our withdrawal from Albania and release from duty. After\r\nmonths of canned goods came Paris with its famous dishes; Creme d'Isigny\r\navec creme! Artichauts an beurre! Patisseries francaises! Oo lala! Again\r\nI said calories be _dashed_! I can reduce when I get home. I had no\r\ndelusions now, you see.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now I am home trying to help raise the funds for the starving\r\nchildren of Central Europe, and explaining to my friends that while\r\nthere is a food shortage in Europe it is not because I was there; and\r\nthat I am reducing and the money that I can save will help keep a child\r\nfrom starving, and that they can do the same; that for every pang of\r\nhunger we feel we can have a double joy, that of knowing we are saving\r\nworse pangs in some little children, and that of knowing that for every\r\npang we feel we lose a pound. A pang's a pound the world around we'll\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nEvery once in a while you hear that the caloric theory has been\r\nexploded. There is no caloric \"theory.\" Therefore none to explode.\r\nCalories are simply units for measuring heat and energy and never will\r\nbe exploded any more than the yard or meter \"theory\" will be exploded.\r\nFoods must contain essential salts and the growth and health maintaining\r\nelements. These cannot be measured by calories. The quantity of heat or\r\nenergy production but not the quality of the foods is measured in\r\ncalories, and one must have a knowledge of the qualities also. No\r\nscientifically educated individual has ever thought otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to following the advice of the numerous laymen who\r\nwrite eat-and-grow-thin menus is that they advise the elimination of all\r\nfats, sugars and starches. They lose sight of the fact, or they do not\r\nknow, that the obese individual--I dislike that term--will have to have\r\na balanced diet even while reducing if he is to maintain his health. One\r\nwill lose weight on these menus, but as very many can testify they lose\r\ntheir health also. One cannot live on an unbalanced diet for any length\r\nof time without becoming unbalanced also. And furthermore the\r\nover-weighter will always have to diet more or less, and will have to\r\nhave menus which he can continue to use. After normal weight is reached\r\nhe will not have to be nearly so abstemious, _but_ the same dietetic\r\nerrors which produced overweight in the first place will produce it\r\nagain. So he must know something of dietetics and he must have a\r\nbalanced diet.\r\n\r\nNow I shall make out some balanced menus, 1200 C's a day, being careful\r\nto include a large amount of the leafy vegetables and some milk or its\r\nproducts, the foods that McCollom calls PROTECTIVE FOODS because they\r\ncontain in a large measure the essential mineral salts, and those vital\r\nelements he has called \"Fat soluble A\" and \"Water soluble B\"--others\r\ncall vitamines--which he has proved to be so vital and necessary for\r\ngrowth in the young and the maintenance of health in the adult. I shall\r\nalso include 200-300 C's of protein.\r\n\r\nThe leafy vegetables, cabbage, cauliflower, celery tops, lettuce, onion,\r\nSwiss chard, turnip tops, and other leaves employed as greens, water\r\ncress, etc., not only contain these vital elements, but they also exert\r\na favourable influence on sluggish bowels and kidneys. They are low in\r\ncaloric value, hence are low in fat-producing properties, and can be\r\nconsumed with indiscretion, properly masticated.\r\n\r\nIt is better while you are reducing to stay away from the dining table\r\nwhen you do not expect to eat. If you are rooming, get a tiny sterno\r\noutfit, some substitute or coffee, some canned or dry milk, some sugar\r\nif you use it, and you can make a hot drink in your room and be\r\nindependent for your breakfast and your evening meal, when you decide\r\nsome day to go without that. Do not take more than 100 calories for your\r\nbreakfast. That leaves you 1100 calories to be divided during the day if\r\nyou go on a 1200 calorie schedule. I suggest the following distribution\r\nof the calories:\r\n\r\n     Breakfast                      100 C's.\r\n     Lunch                          350   \"\r\n     Tea                            100   \"\r\n     Dinner                         650   \"\r\n\r\nYou can reverse the dinner and lunch if you desire. If you do so then\r\nhave your 100 calories I have allowed for tea time to take just before\r\nyou retire. On a 1200 calorie schedule arranged as I have it you will\r\nnot be hungry, I assure you. It will not be more than three or four days\r\nbefore your stomach will be shrunk and this amount I have allowed you\r\nwill almost seem like overeating! That is the big idea. Shrink your\r\nstomach. Go on a fast or low calorie day for a day if necessary to get\r\nstarted. See page 81.\r\n\r\nI can safely say that any up and around adult will reduce on 1200\r\ncalories, for that will not supply the basal metabolism, i.e., the\r\nbody's internal activities, such as the beating of the heart,\r\nrespiration, digestion, excretion, etc., and some of the body's stored\r\nfat will be called upon to supply the deficiency. How much one will\r\nreduce depends on how many calories are actually needed for the internal\r\nand the external activities. See pages 26 and 27. It is not advisable to\r\nreduce too rapidly. See page 85.\r\n\r\nNow you have 1200 calories a day to eat. Let us think of this in terms\r\nof money. You have a limited amount of money every day to spend for\r\nfood. You must spend it judiciously and get the food you need and want.\r\nIf you spend the most of it on one article you have that much less for\r\nother things. It is possible that some days you will want to spend more\r\nthan your allowance and you draw on your next day's supply. That will be\r\nall right if you remember that you have done so and will spend that much\r\nless the next day to equalize your account. You must study to spend\r\nwisely and carefully so as to supply your needs, but you cannot spend\r\nmore than you have without restitution and retribution.
