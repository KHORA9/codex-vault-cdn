Originally I intended to do no more than gather together into a\r\nsuccinct record the various memorials and reminders of Pestilence that\r\nI had met with in my wanderings at home and abroad and in my casual\r\nincursions into general literature. Insensibly the desire to understand\r\nsupplanted the desire merely to record, and the desire to explain\r\nsuperseded the endeavour to understand. I have turned my attention,\r\nas far as practicable, only to the literary and artistic associations\r\nof Pestilence, but these have inevitably overlapped the confines of\r\nhistory and of medical science. The latter territory has been invaded\r\nonly so far as was necessary to ensure a correct orientation to the\r\ninquiry. I have thought it wise to let the curtain fall at the end\r\nof the eighteenth century, leaving it to my readers to decide what\r\nvestiges of the mentality of distant centuries have survived into this\r\ntwentieth. A little reflection on this will afford a most salutary\r\nlesson to all of us.\r\n\r\n_January 1914._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PLATES\r\n\r\n\r\n    S. Sebastian.

By Baron Gros  _To face p._ 208\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scattered records of literature afford a valuable, but neglected,\r\ncontribution to the study of epidemic pestilence. They show us\r\npestilence as an affair of the mind, as medical literature has shown\r\nit as an affair of the body. They teach us too the humiliating\r\nlesson that, in spite of the progress of civilization, in spite of\r\nthe apparent growth of humanity, in spite of the development and\r\ndissemination of scientific knowledge, human nature has again and again\r\nreverted to the primitive instincts of savagery in face of the crushing\r\ncalamity of epidemic pestilence. The superficial student of psychology\r\nmay find it difficult to believe that, so late as 1630 in Milan, so\r\nlate as 1656 in Naples, so late as 1771 in Moscow, the blood-lust of\r\na maddened populace sought and found a sedative in an orgy of human\r\nsacrifice. But so it was. And in this homing instinct of the human mind\r\nis to be found the clue to much in the records of literature and art\r\nthat else is wholly meaningless. It is a grim chapter of history that\r\nlies before us, but maybe we shall find here and there some spiritual\r\nBethel reared out of the hard stones on which suffering humanity has\r\nlain its weary head.\r\n\r\nThe mind of primitive man conceives no power over nature higher than\r\nhis own: so is his attitude conditioned to disease. He sees in disease\r\nonly some evil magic, exercised by man on man. The Australian native\r\nbelieves that the assailant transmits disease by pointing some object\r\nat his victim, who in turn looks to magic to free him from the disease.\r\nIn the New Hebrides the idea still persists that the aggressor shoots\r\nsome charmed material at the victim by means of bow and arrow. Medicine\r\nhas not yet emerged from magic. The human mind, as it passes to higher\r\nstages of enlightenment, does not wholly discard its primitive beliefs:\r\nof this we find abundant testimony in early records of pestilence.\r\nIn Pharaoh’s plagues mark the importance of the manual acts, the\r\nstretching out of the rod, the smiting of the dust, the sprinkling of\r\nashes. Again, when the Philistines of Ashdod ask for deliverance from\r\nplague, the diviners enjoin them to make images of their emerods, or\r\nswellings. This is crude magic—imitative magic—the essence of which\r\nis that any effect may be produced by imitating it. It is the spirit in\r\nwhich a savage sprinkles water when he wishes rain to fall.\r\n\r\nAs his own impotence is borne in on man, he comes to look beyond\r\nhimself alike for the cause and cure of his disease; but human agency\r\nstill bounds his whole horizon. He looks to those likest himself in\r\nnature, the imperishable spirits of his own departed dead. Endued with\r\nbodily form, their ghosts need offerings of food and drink, and humble\r\nhomage of prayer. Neglect of these is recompensed by the sending of\r\nsickness and death. This cult prevailed in the religion of young Rome\r\nand in the Greek worship of beings of the underworld (χθόνιοι), and\r\nmay be found to-day in Oceania. Such a deified spirit of the dead\r\nmight exert his influence in dreams to those who slept over his abode.\r\nSuch is the germ of the incubation ritual of the demigod Asclepius,\r\nwho revealed remedies for sickness, and was invoked for deliverance\r\nfrom pestilence. Strabo says that Tricca in Thessaly was the oldest\r\nsanctuary of Asclepius, who was the deified ancestor of the Phlegyae\r\nand Minyae, the ruling family of Tricca.\r\n\r\nWith the emergence of the idea of a separable soul came the belief in\r\nits assumption after death of animal forms, and chief of these the\r\nmysterious earth-dwelling serpent, darting pestilence from his barbed\r\ntongue. The association of the serpent with disease and pestilence is\r\nwellnigh world-wide. The Vedas teem with it: classical and Christian\r\nliterature and art are full of it. We find it in Ovid,[1] in Gregory of\r\nTours,[2] in Paul the Deacon,[3] and in many other writers. The Book\r\nof Numbers too (xxi. 6 seq.) retains this imagery of pestilence: ‘And\r\nthe Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people;\r\nand much people of Israel died. Therefore the people came to Moses, and\r\nsaid, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against\r\nthee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And\r\nMoses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee\r\na fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass,\r\nthat every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And\r\nMoses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to\r\npass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent\r\nof brass, he lived.’ Imitative magic—the healing of like by like—is\r\nstill the weapon with which Moses counters the pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn Fernando Po,[4] when an epidemic breaks out among children, it is\r\ncustomary to set up a serpent’s skin on a pole in the middle of the\r\npublic square, and the mothers bring their infants to touch it. In\r\nMadagascar, Sibree[5] found that Ramahavaly, the god of healing, was\r\nalso the patron of serpents, and was able to employ them as agents\r\nof his anger. In many parts of India also it is customary to make a\r\nserpent of clay or metal, and offer sacrifices to it on behalf of the\r\nsufferer.[6] Apollonius of Tyana also is said to have freed Antioch\r\nfrom scorpions by making a bronze image of a scorpion and burying it\r\nunder a small pillar in the middle of the city. So the serpent has\r\npower not only to excite pestilence, but also to avert it.\r\n\r\nFrom these spirits of the nether world, human or animal in form, it\r\nis a short passage to the conception of supernatural beings above the\r\nearth, but still in human shape and still with human attributes. Such\r\nare Apollo, Asclepius, and Rudra. Traces of the evolution of these\r\ndeities are usually to be found in the attributes with which they are\r\nendowed in later literature and art. The usual symbol of Asclepius\r\nis a serpent coiled round a staff. Sacred snakes were kept in his\r\ntemples,[7] and applicants for healing fed them with cakes.[8] Cures\r\nwere frequently effected in the sanctuaries of Asclepius by serpents\r\nstealing out and licking the wounds of patients. The god-man finally\r\nsupersedes the serpent, but conservative religious sentiment retains\r\nthe older object of worship as the symbol and associate of the new. In\r\nGreek legend it is the serpent from which Asclepius learns the art of\r\nhealing: true, Homer makes Chiron his teacher. Numerous other legends\r\nof the serpent origin of medicine survive. Polyindus the seer is said\r\nto have learnt the herbs that can restore men to life by observing how\r\nthe serpents raised their dead to life. In Cashmere[9] the descendants\r\nof the Naga (serpent) tribes attribute their special skill in healing\r\nto knowledge bestowed on their ancestors by serpents: and the Celts\r\nacquired their medical lore from drinking serpent broth. As with\r\nAsclepius, so also we shall see with Apollo. Apollo in very truth\r\nslays the man-killing Python, and himself becomes also the sender of\r\npestilence. He not only smites with disease the doer of evil, but wards\r\nit off from the upright. His are the arrows that scatter plague: but he\r\nis also the best of physicians. Such is the Apollo of the _Iliad_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I (Face Page 4)\r\n\r\n    Apollo with Bow and Mouse      Asclepius with Serpent\r\n    Serpent and Galley\r\n    Christ on the Cross      The Brazen Serpent]\r\n\r\nHomer’s[10] aged priest Chryses, when he calls upon Apollo to avenge\r\nthe ravishing of his daughter, invokes him as God of the Silver Bow\r\n(Ἀργυρότοξος). Apollo hears his prayer, and\r\n\r\n    Down from Olympus’ heights he passed, his heart\r\n    Burning with wrath: behind his shoulders hung\r\n    His bow and ample quiver: at his back\r\n    Rattled the fateful arrows as he moved:\r\n    Like the night-cloud he passed: and from afar\r\n    He bent against the ships and sped the bolt:\r\n    And fierce and deadly twanged the silver bow:\r\n    First on the mules and dogs, on man the last,\r\n    Was poured the arrowy storm; and through the camp\r\n    Constant and numerous blazed the funeral fires.\r\n    Nine days the heavenly Archer on the troops\r\n    Hurled his dread shafts.[11]\r\n\r\nHomer’s picture of the Archer Apollo has inspired one at least of the\r\nmasterpieces of Graeco-Roman sculpture. Apollo the Avenger sends the\r\npestilence in punishment of sin. Homer sets it as a signal evidence\r\nof divine displeasure in the forefront of his epic, as does Sophocles\r\nafter him in the greatest of his tragedies. Apollo is pictured as the\r\ngod who spreads the plague by arrows shot from his bow. He swoops down\r\nwith impetuous onset, like the sudden fall of night in Mediterranean\r\nlands, as the ‘pestilence that walketh in darkness’ and ‘the arrow\r\nthat flieth by day’. The plague is first epizootic, falling on mules\r\nand dogs, then epidemic among the Greek host. A council is called, and\r\nAchilles advises that some prophet or priest be summoned to say what\r\npropitiatory sacrifices have been neglected:\r\n\r\n    If for neglected hecatombs or prayers\r\n    He blames us: or if fat of lambs and goats\r\n    May soothe his anger and the plague assuage.\r\n\r\nThe seer Calchas shows them that it is sent rather as a punishment\r\nfor flagrant sin, the sin of Agamemnon in carrying off Chryseis. It\r\nis for no neglect of honorific sacrifices nor for neglected prayers\r\nthat pestilence has come upon them. Chryseis must be sent back, and\r\nexpiation be made to Apollo with sacrifices, after the whole host has\r\nbeen purified in the doubly cleansing water of the sea. So Chryseis is\r\nsent back and\r\n\r\n    Next proclamation through the camp was made\r\n    To purify the host; and in the sea,\r\n    Obedient to the word, they purified:\r\n    Then to Apollo solemn rites performed\r\n    With faultless hecatombs of bulls and goats,\r\n    Upon the margin of the watery waste:\r\n    And wreathed in smoke the savour rose to heaven.\r\n\r\nThus they offer the sacrifice of atonement for sin, with the ablutions\r\nmeet for a solemn lustration of the people. Then when the plague is\r\nstayed, and not till then, may they join in the glad eucharistic feast\r\nof meat-offerings and libations of red wine, the whole assemblage\r\ntaking it in company with the god, crowning the cups with flowers and\r\nchanting hymns of praise.\r\n\r\nThe Apollo of the _Iliad_, like the serpent of old, is not only the\r\nsender but also the averter of pestilence.\r\n\r\nHomer’s plague marks a stage at which prayer and sacrifice have\r\ndisplaced magic in the struggle with pestilence. From this time on the\r\nstudy of pestilence is inextricably blended with that of the evolution\r\nof religion. Prayer and sacrifice follow inevitably from the conception\r\nof the majestic man-god. He must be approached on bended knee with\r\nrequest for help: his is by right the homage of prayer. His worshipper\r\napproaches him as he would an earthly potentate: he cleanses himself,\r\nhe begs for grace in humble posture, he gives him of his best. Hence\r\narise purification, prayer, and sacrifice. At first, as in Homer, it is\r\nthe body that is purified: the offering of a clean heart and a right\r\nspirit is of later growth. So long as the god is humanly conceived,\r\nfood and drink will be the meet offerings of sacrifice. Later with the\r\nconception of a god dwelling aloft, as in the Homeric verse, the sweet\r\nsavour of the sacrifice, or of the scented smoke of incense rising to\r\nheaven, will find peculiar favour in his sight. Primitive sacrifice is\r\nessentially social: it is a banquet in which the worshippers join in\r\ncommunion with the god: it is the true parent of the _lectisternium_.\r\nEarly religion has no doubts of the god’s good-will, if duly solicited:\r\nhence the joyousness of dance and song attendant on the eucharistic\r\nfeast, the worshippers being convinced that the sacrifice has restored\r\nthem to the favour of the god. The stern god, the God of the Old\r\nTestament, slow to forgive, has no place in primitive theology. Hymns,\r\nsuch as the Greek warriors sang in jubilant unison to Apollo, are\r\nthe first dim gropings of language into the domains of literature.\r\nPaeans of this kind were chanted in the sanctuaries of Asclepius after\r\nsuccessful acts of healing.\r\n\r\nIn early Indian myth Rudra is the god who lets fly the arrows of\r\npestilence. Read this prayer to Rudra from the _Atharvaveda_[12]:\r\nthere are many like it in the older _Rig-Veda_, which reached near its\r\npresent form as early as 1500 B.C.\r\n\r\n_Prayer to Bhava_[13] _and Sava_[14] _for protection from dangers._\r\n\r\n           1. O Bhava and Sava, be merciful, do not attack us: ye\r\n        lords of beings, lords of cattle, reverence be to you twain!\r\n        Discharge not your arrow even after it has been laid (on\r\n        the bow) and has been drawn! Destroy not our bipeds and our\r\n        quadrupeds.\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n           7. May we not conflict with Rudra, the archer with the\r\n        dark crest, the thousand-eyed powerful one, the slayer of\r\n        Ardhaka!\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n          12. Thou, O crested god, earnest in (thy hand) that smites\r\n        thousands, a yellow golden bow that slays hundreds: Rudra’s\r\n        arrow, the missile of the gods, flies abroad: reverence be\r\n        to it, in whatever direction from here (it flies).\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n          19. Do not hurl at us thy club, thy divine bolt: be not\r\n        incensed at us, O lord of cattle! Shake over some other than\r\n        us the celestial branch!\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n          26. Do not, O Rudra, contaminate us with fever, or with\r\n        poison, or with heavenly fire: cause this lightning to\r\n        descend elsewhere than upon us!\r\n\r\nOther gods than Rudra can stem the pestilence. ‘Vayu [the wind] shall\r\nbend the points of the enemies’ bows, Indra shall break their arms,\r\nso that they shall be unable to lay on their arrows: Aditya [the sun]\r\nshall send their missiles astray, and Krandramas [the moon] shall bar\r\nthe way of the enemy that has not started.’[15] Like the Madonna of the\r\nChristian Church Aditya staves off the arrows of pestilence. The Aryan\r\nwarrior certainly, the primitive Greek probably, used poisoned arrows.\r\n\r\nThe language of the 91st Psalm reveals the same imagery as do the\r\nHomeric epic and the Vedic hymns.\r\n\r\n        ‘I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope, and my\r\n    stronghold: my God, in him will I trust. For he shall\r\n    deliver thee from the snare of the hunter: and from\r\n    the noisome pestilence. He shall defend thee under his\r\n    wings, and thou shalt be safe under his feathers: his\r\n    faithfulness and truth shall be thy shield and buckler.\r\n    Thou shalt not be afraid for any terror by night: nor\r\n    for the arrow that flieth by day: For the pestilence\r\n    that walketh in darkness: nor for the sickness that\r\n    destroyeth in the noonday. A thousand shall fall beside\r\n    thee, and ten thousand at thy right hand: but it shall\r\n    not come nigh thee.’\r\n\r\nThe arrows of pestilence have sunk deep into the tissue of many\r\nlanguages. Practically all the Hebrew words for plague (_Maggefah_,\r\n_Negef_, _Naga_, _Makkah_) indicate a blow. Our English ‘plague’ is\r\nderived through the Latin _plaga_ from the Greek πληγή, a blow: so too\r\nthe German _plage_. The French _fléau_—a flail or a plague—embodies\r\nthe same idea of a blow, and is derived from the Latin _flagellum_ and\r\nthe Greek θλίβω. To-day even physicians must needs call the poisons\r\nof pestilence ‘toxines’, as though they were arrow-poisons discharged\r\nfrom a bow (τόξον from τυγχάνω = I hit). The Arabians speak of being\r\n‘stung’ or ‘pricked’ with plague, recalling respectively the serpents\r\nand the arrows of pestilence.\r\n\r\nPassing allusion has been made above to the plagues of Pharaoh: it\r\nremains only to be said that there is now pretty general agreement\r\nthat these ten plagues represent merely the seasonal variations, to\r\nwhich Egypt is peculiarly liable, magnified in Jewish oral tradition.\r\nPerhaps the last plague, the death of the first-born, at the April of\r\nthe exodus (_circa_ 1220 B.C.) may have been a true _pestis puerorum_,\r\nfalling with chief severity on those who lacked the immunity afforded\r\nby a previous epidemic. It was the incursion of Libyans and of the\r\nnations of the Greek seas into Egypt, at least as much as the Biblical\r\nplagues, that enabled the Israelitish serfs to make good their escape.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of wandering in the wilderness Korah, Dathan,\r\nand Abiram revolted against the ascendancy of Moses and Aaron, and\r\nGod caused them to be swallowed up with all their households by an\r\nearthquake. Some of the children of Israel murmured against their\r\nfate. Those that did so were visited with a plague, that carried off\r\n14,700 persons. The plague was stayed by Aaron offering incense as an\r\natonement on the altar—sacrifice still, but the sacrifice only of a\r\nsweet savour to a God dwelling in heaven. The juxtaposition, if it be\r\nnot permissible to say the association, of earthquake and pestilence in\r\nthis narrative is noteworthy, in view of the widespread belief in their\r\ncausal relationship, in later times.\r\n\r\nAll through the Old Testament plague is regarded, as here, as a direct\r\nconsequence of God’s anger. In the New Testament it figures but\r\nlittle, and then rather as corrective than punitive. The God of the\r\nOld Testament is a God of vengeance: only in the later Prophets do\r\nwe find even a foreshadowing of the God of love and forgiveness, the\r\nGod of the New Testament. In portraying pestilence Art has retained\r\nthis conception of God as a stern punisher of wrongdoing, but in the\r\npersonality of Christ, approached through the mediation of the Madonna\r\nand Saints, has recognized the New Testament conception of God.\r\n\r\nThe entrance into Canaan was the beginning to the Israelites of a long\r\nperiod of warfare with surrounding tribes. At last, in the pitched\r\nbattle of Eben-ezer, the Philistines crushed the army of Israel,\r\ncaptured the ark of the covenant, and carried it off to Ashdod, where\r\nthey placed it in the temple of their own national god, Dagon. On two\r\nsuccessive nights the image of Dagon was mysteriously thrown down from\r\nits pedestal. ‘The hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and\r\nhe destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and the\r\ncoasts thereof.’ The men of Ashdod made haste to send away the ark to\r\nGath, another Philistine city, but here, too, God ‘smote the men of\r\nthe city, both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret\r\nparts’. From Gath it was sent to Ekron with like result: ‘for there\r\nwas a deadly destruction throughout all the city; the hand of God was\r\nvery heavy there. And the men that died not were smitten with the\r\nemerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.’ After seven months\r\nof pestilence, the Philistines called for the priests and diviners,\r\nto inquire in what way they should send back the ark. These told them\r\nthat, if they wished for deliverance from the plague, the ark must on\r\nno account be sent back empty, but with a trespass-offering of five\r\ngolden emerods and five golden mice, ‘images of your emerods, and\r\nimages of your mice that mar the land.’ The ark was to be sent in a new\r\ncart, drawn by two milch kine, while their calves were kept at home.\r\nIf the kine took the straight way by the coast to Beth-shemesh, they\r\nwould know that it was God that had smitten them, ‘but if not, then we\r\nshall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it was a chance that\r\nhappened to us. And the men did so: and took two milch kine, and tied\r\nthem to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: And they laid the\r\nark of the Lord upon the cart, and the coffer with the mice of gold and\r\nthe images of their emerods. And the kine took the straight way to the\r\nway of Beth-shemesh, and went along the highway, lowing as they went,\r\nand turned not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of\r\nthe Philistines went after them unto the border of Beth-shemesh. And\r\nthey of Beth-shemesh were reaping their wheat-harvest in the valley:\r\nand they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced to see\r\nit. And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Beth-shemite, and\r\nstood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the wood of\r\nthe cart, and offered the kine a burnt-offering unto the Lord. And the\r\nLevites took down the ark of the Lord, and the coffer that was with\r\nit, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone:\r\nand the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed\r\nsacrifices the same day unto the Lord ..., which stone remaineth unto\r\nthis day in the field of Joshua, the Beth-shemite.’ Fifty thousand and\r\nseventy of the people of Beth-shemesh were smitten with the plague,\r\n‘because they had looked into the ark of the Lord.’\r\n\r\nIn its essential features the narrative of this plague of Ashdod is\r\na mere replica of the Homeric plague. The manifest cause is God’s\r\ndispleasure, but when it falls on Israelites, God’s chosen people, as\r\nwell as on Philistines, it is perplexing, for knowledge of contagion\r\nor communicability is as yet unborn. But an explanation is ready to\r\nhand—the Israelites _also_ have offended God by looking into the ark.\r\nThe sin-offerings are to be representations in gold of the disease,\r\nakin to the votive offerings of diseased parts dedicated in the\r\nsanctuaries of Asclepius, and representations of mice, which then and\r\nafter were generally associated with pestilence—imitative magic again\r\nin its simplest form. The sacrificial stone is left as a commemorative\r\naltar for all time. Religion has now appeared to reinforce magic.\r\nThe Philistine diviners do indeed hazard the thought that the plague\r\nmay have been a mere ‘chance that happened to us’, and so faintly\r\nforeshadow a belief in the natural causation of epidemic disease.\r\n\r\nHave we sufficient data to establish the identity of this contagious\r\npestilence? It broke out on the sea-coast among a race of maritime\r\ntraders, and spread from the coast to other inland towns. It lasted\r\nmore than seven months. It took on two forms, a severe type with early\r\ndeath, and a less fatal type, in which swellings (so-called emerods)\r\ndeveloped in the secret parts, a comprehensive term which habitually\r\nincluded the whole area adjacent to the genitals, and therein the\r\ngroins. On these data alone it is difficult to avoid the conclusion\r\nthat it was true oriental plague, with a proportion of bubonic cases, a\r\ndisease that throughout its recorded history has hugged this corner of\r\nthe Levant.\r\n\r\nVotive offerings for the healing of disease generally portrayed the\r\npart diseased, rather than the actual disease, the latter so often\r\ndefying plastic representation. But, in the case of a simple swelling,\r\nit is natural that the disease itself should be modelled.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to assert with confidence a direct causal connexion\r\nbetween the morbid swellings and the mice, for rats and mice were ill\r\ndistinguished from each other until recent times. The matter is further\r\ncomplicated by the fact that there is considerable doubt as to the\r\nauthenticity of parts, at least, of the narrative. The composition of\r\nthe Books of Samuel ranged over some seven centuries, from 900-200\r\nB.C., and the mouse story is believed to be a late interpolation,\r\nof which it is impossible to fix the date. But in the text, as it\r\nstands, the mice are designated ‘mice that mar the land’, and ancient\r\nliterature abounds in records of appalling devastation of crops by\r\nthe agency of field-mice. Aelian,[16] Aristotle,[17] Strabo,[18]\r\nTheophrastus, Pliny, and others testify to this. Loeffler[19] gives\r\nan account of a Thessalian corn-harvest destroyed by a horde of\r\nfield-voles, a field being completely devastated in a single night.\r\nMice were, in fact, one prominent cause of the famine-plagues[20]\r\nof history. Viewed in this light, it helps us to understand another\r\nBiblical pestilence, that fell on the army of Sennacherib, in 701 B.C.,\r\nat Pelusium. This campaign of Sennacherib was undertaken to quell a\r\ngeneral revolt of the western states against Assyrian supremacy and\r\nthe payment of tribute to the Assyrian king. The revolt was fomented,\r\nseemingly, by Merodach-Baladan, whom Sargon had ousted from the\r\nkingship of Babylon, and who now drew Hezekiah into the revolt. He\r\nsent an embassy with gifts to Hezekiah, nominally to congratulate\r\nhim on his recovery from a severe illness, which the Bible narrative\r\nterms ‘a boil’. This may perhaps indicate true pustular plague, but\r\nforms of boil (e. g. Baghdad boil), quite distinct from plague, are\r\nfamiliar occurrences in several regions of the East. Sennacherib first\r\ncrushed Merodach-Baladan, and then advanced against Hezekiah, who at\r\nonce called on Tirhaquah, the Ethiopian viceroy of Egypt, for help.\r\nAt the pitched battle of Altaku Sennacherib defeated Tirhaquah, and\r\nshut up Hezekiah in Jerusalem, to which he proceeded to lay siege.\r\nMeantime Tirhaquah rallied his army and again advanced to the aid of\r\nHezekiah, so that Sennacherib was compelled to march south against him.\r\nAt Pelusium, on the border of Egypt, Sennacherib’s army was suddenly\r\ndestroyed by a pestilence, that compelled him to withdraw the remnant\r\nat once to Assyria. ‘And it came to pass that night, that the angel of\r\nthe Lord went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred\r\nfourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning,\r\nbehold, they were all dead corpses.’[21] Isaiah confirms in detail the\r\nnarrative of the Book of Kings, and the Chaldaean chronicler, Berosus,\r\nin a fragment preserved by Josephus, states also that Sennacherib was\r\ndriven back by pestilence. The prism inscriptions of Sennacherib are\r\ncharacteristically silent on the subject: they tell only how he shut up\r\nHezekiah in Jerusalem, like a bird in a cage.\r\n\r\nPelusium has an evil reputation in the annals of pestilence. Procopius\r\ncites it as the starting-point of Justinian’s plague. There, too, one\r\nof the Crusading expeditions developed plague; and again, in A.D. 1799,\r\nthe army of Napoleon was infected there and carried the disease into\r\nSyria. The explanation is not far to seek. The eastern and southern\r\ncoasts of the Mediterranean, and more particularly Syria, Egypt, and\r\nLibya, were the points to which the merchants of the East brought their\r\nmerchandise for exchange with that of the West. From time immemorial\r\nArab caravans and camels had traversed well-worn trade routes from\r\nthe East abutting on the Mediterranean at Tyre, Sidon, and Pelusium,\r\nand later at Alexandria. In these meeting-places of East and West, as\r\nalso at Constantinople, plague would most readily, and actually did,\r\nfind a footing. Possibly the eastern Delta may have been an endemic\r\ncentre, but more likely, as was believed in the late Chinese plague, a\r\ndistributing centre was an original source.\r\n\r\nByron in his lines in the _Hebrew Melodies_ on the ‘Destruction of\r\nSennacherib’ has caught the passionate note of fervid patriotism, on\r\nwhich the chosen race celebrated their deliverance from the heathen\r\nenemy by the might of their own God, and has retained the imagery and\r\nsimple diction of the Bible story:\r\n\r\n    For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,\r\n    And breathed on the face of the foe as he passed:\r\n    And the eyes of the sleepers wax’d deadly and chill,\r\n    And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still.\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n    And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,\r\n    Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.\r\n\r\nHerodotus[22] relates that the tradition of this wonderful deliverance\r\nlived on in Egypt also. His cicerone in the temple of Ptah at Memphis\r\ntold him the following tale. ‘The next king was a priest of Vulcan,\r\ncalled Sethos. This monarch despised and neglected the warrior class of\r\nthe Egyptians, as though he did not need their services. Among other\r\nindignities which he offered them, he took from them the lands which\r\nthey possessed under all the previous kings, consisting of twelve\r\nacres of choice land for each warrior. Afterwards, therefore, when\r\nSennacherib, king of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched his vast army\r\ninto Egypt, the warriors one and all refused to come to his aid. On\r\nthis the monarch, greatly distressed, entered into the inner sanctuary,\r\nand before the image of the god bewailed the fate that impended over\r\nhim. As he wept he fell asleep, and dreamed that the god came and stood\r\nat his side, bidding him be of good cheer, and go boldly forth to meet\r\nthe Arabian host, which would do him no hurt, as he himself would send\r\nthose who should help him. Sethos then, relying on the dream, collected\r\nsuch of the Egyptians as were willing to follow him, who were none of\r\nthem warriors, but traders, artisans, and market people, and with these\r\nmarched to Pelusium, which commands the entrance into Egypt, and there\r\npitched his camp. As the two armies lay here opposite one another,\r\nthere came in the night a multitude of field-mice, which devoured all\r\nthe quivers and bow-strings of the enemy and ate the thongs by which\r\nthey managed their shields. Next morning they commenced their flight,\r\nand great multitudes fell, as they had no arms with which to defend\r\nthemselves. There stands to this day in the temple of Vulcan a stone\r\nstatue of Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription to this\r\neffect: “Look on me and learn to reverence the gods.”’\r\n\r\nStrabo[23] has a story of mice eating up the bow-strings, and a variant\r\nof it appears also in Chinese annals,[24] so that it may be regarded as\r\nmerely a figurative expression for some providential deliverance from\r\nan enemy, and in the case of Sennacherib the medium of deliverance was\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say whose was the statue Herodotus ascribes to\r\nSethos, for no king Sethos is known in Egyptian history. Perhaps it was\r\na statue of Horus, the Egyptian equivalent of Apollo, or not impossibly\r\nof Apollo himself, for we have abundant evidence of the association of\r\nthe mouse with Apollo. In the pestilence of the _Iliad_,[25] Chryses\r\naddresses him as Mouse-God (Σμινθεύς). Strabo says that the statue of\r\nApollo Smintheus in Chrysa, a town of the Troad, had a mouse beneath\r\nhis foot: so also has a bronze coin now in the British Museum. De\r\nWitte[26] has figured coins of Alexandria, the more ancient Hamaxitus,\r\nin the Troad, in which Apollo Smintheus is represented with his bow,\r\nand a mouse on his hand. Aelian[27] says that an effigy of the mouse\r\nstood beside the tripod of Apollo. An ancient bas-relief, of uncertain\r\ndate, illustrating the Homeric plague and the offerings of the Greeks\r\nto Apollo Smintheus, also shows a mouse on a tripod. Another shows\r\nApollo with a mouse beneath his chin: so, too, does a coin of Tenedos.\r\nWhite mice were actually kept beneath the altar in the temple of Apollo\r\nSmintheus at Hamaxitus, and were fed at the public expense. Strabo[28]\r\nsays that the worship of Apollo Smintheus extended to the whole coast\r\nof Asia Minor and to the neighbouring islands.\r\n\r\nMany votive offerings in the form of mice have been found, at\r\nAlexandria Troas,[29] in Palestine,[30] and elsewhere, and Strabo\r\nsuggests that the worship of mice originated in a desire to propitiate\r\nmice, so as to induce them not to ravage the cornfields. The\r\npropitiation of animals,[31] and particularly of those that infest\r\nthe crops, is common in the worship of primitive men. The Philistines\r\nare said to have made images of the mice that marred their land, and\r\nsent them out of their country, so as to induce the real mice to\r\ndepart also. In a later stage of worship, when a god has supplanted\r\nthe animal, the god is propitiated instead of the pest itself: hence\r\nMouse Apollo,[32] Locust Apollo,[33] Wolf Apollo,[34] and Zeus Averter\r\nof Flies.[35] Even lowlier pests are absorbed into the godhead, so\r\nthat we have Apollo Erythibius[36] (ἐρυσίβη = mildew), and the Romans\r\npersonified it and worshipped it as Robigus[37] (_robigo_ = mildew).\r\nThe Chams of Indo-China offer sacrifices to a rude pillar-idol, called\r\nYang-tikuh (god-rat), when swarms of rats infest the fields.[38] Thus\r\nApollo seems to stand in the same relation to the mouse, as Asclepius\r\nto the serpent. He not only sends pestilence, but also wards it off\r\nboth from man and from crops. And viewing all the facts we may conclude\r\nwith some certainty that the association of mice with famine-pestilence\r\nwas well recognized, but of any knowledge at this time of the\r\nassociation of rats with plague there is little evidence.\r\n\r\nPlutarch[39] asserts that the Persian Magi killed all their mice and\r\nrats, because they and the gods they worshipped entertained a natural\r\nantipathy to them, a feeling which, he says, they shared with the\r\nArabians and Ethiopians. One is curious to know what may have been\r\nthe real ground of this antipathy, for which Plutarch advances the\r\ncurrent explanation. More than likely it was that experience had taught\r\nthese nations the relation of these animals to famine and perhaps to\r\npestilence as well.\r\n\r\nNicholas Poussin (1593-1665) painted a picture, now in the Louvre,\r\nof the plague of Ashdod. An inferior replica hangs in the National\r\nGallery, and yet another in the Academy at Lisbon. Horror is the\r\ndominant note of a composition that is full of movement. High up\r\nbetween the columns of a temple stands the ark of God. Beside it the\r\nbody of Dagon lies prostrate on its pedestal, with head and hands lying\r\nbelow. A priest points out with his hand the mutilated image to a group\r\nof awe-stricken men, who from their air of authority seem to be elders\r\nof the people. A swarm of rats has invaded the town. The streets are\r\nstrewn with dead and dying of each sex and of every age, and bearers\r\ncarry away the corpses. Broken columns, lying here and there among the\r\nplague-stricken, heighten the sense of death and destruction. In the\r\ncentre of the foreground is a group that Poussin has borrowed from\r\nRaphael. A woman with bared breasts lies dead between her two infants:\r\none is dead, the other is approaching the dead mother’s breast. The\r\nfather stoops down with hand stretched out to hold it back: with his\r\nother he muffles his mouth and nose to shut out infection. To the\r\nright another man holds back an older child who is coming towards\r\nthe dead woman. One man is huddled up in a dying convulsion, another\r\nlies exhausted on a broken pillar. On the steps a sick man implores\r\nassistance from one who hurries past him to avoid infection. To the\r\nleft a man with pity depicted on his face regards another writhing in\r\nagony. The whole scene is set in the centre of the town in an open\r\nspace surrounded by massive buildings in the classical style that\r\nPoussin acquired among the ruined monuments of Rome. None of the bodies\r\nshow any distinctive signs of plague, the disease clearly indicated by\r\nthe presence of swarms of rats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nPLAGUE OF ASHDOD. BY N. POUSSIN\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Giraudon, Paris (Face Page 18)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nPLAGUE OF DAVID. BY P. MIGNARD (Face Page 19)]\r\n\r\nOne other Biblical[40] pestilence, the plague of David, presents to\r\nus another and more enduring image of pestilence, and represents also\r\na stage at which religion has superseded magic. David, in punishment\r\nfor his presumption in numbering the people, is given the choice of\r\nseven years of famine, three months of fleeing before his enemies, or\r\nthree days of pestilence. He chose the last, and seventy thousand of\r\nhis people perished. ‘And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the Angel\r\nof the Lord stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn\r\nsword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.’ ‘And when the angel\r\nstretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it,’ God checked him\r\nby the threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite. ‘And the Lord commanded\r\nthe angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.’ Then\r\nthe prophet Gad told David to set up an altar in the threshing-floor of\r\nAraunah. So David bought it and set up an altar and offered sacrifice\r\nto God, and the plague was stayed: on the site of this altar Solomon\r\nbuilt the Temple.\r\n\r\nHere again pestilence figures as a signal evidence of God’s\r\ndispleasure. An angel is the agent by which He spreads the plague,\r\nand the drawn sword, Israel’s favourite weapon, replaces the bow and\r\narrow. The sheathing of the sword is the sign that the pestilence is\r\nended. This imagery appears again and again in Christian literature and\r\nart, and seems to have its origin here. Angels are a beautiful fancy\r\nof all religions of the East. So vivid is the primitive conception of\r\npestilence, that we find it personified from earliest times: now as\r\nan archer-god: now as one walking in darkness: now as an angel with\r\ndrawn sword. David offers the same expiatory sacrifice and rears a\r\ncommemorative altar, as was done in the plague of Ashdod.\r\n\r\nPierre Mignard (1610-95) has painted the plague of David. The original\r\nis lost, but an engraving by Audran is to be had at the Chalcographie\r\nof the Louvre. As with Poussin, the scene is set with a background\r\nof classical architecture, but the rendering of the figures shows\r\nlittle trace of classical feeling. The central theme is the idea of\r\ndevotion in the presence of suffering. An angel in the sky is pouring\r\nforth sulphurous fumes from two vessels, as brimstone and fire were\r\nrained down upon Sodom and Gomorrah. On the peristyle of a temple King\r\nDavid offers sacrifices of atonement to stay the plague, while the\r\npeople prostrate themselves in attitudes of supplication around the\r\nsteps of the temple. In the background is a cascade of water falling\r\ninto a basin, beside which one man lies dying, while others endeavour\r\nto slake their thirst. Two men hasten forward to drive them from the\r\nbasin, before they pollute its water. This incident is derived with\r\nsome licence of interpretation from the narrative of Thucydides. In the\r\ncentre of the picture, reminiscent of Raphael, a young woman lies dying\r\nin her husband’s arms, her dead child still stretched across her knees.\r\nIn the foreground is a charcoal brazier giving off purifying fumes.\r\nNear it a doctor, who has just incised a bubo in a woman’s armpit,\r\nfalls back in a state of collapse, dropping his bistoury and bowl,\r\nwhile his assistant, who is still holding the woman’s arm away from her\r\nside, grasps at his master to prevent him falling. A bystander makes\r\noff in horrified dismay. Compassion and cowardice are here ranged side\r\nby side. To the right two men are distributing food and medicine to the\r\nsick. An attendant kneels to offer a stricken man a cup of water, while\r\na torch-bearer follows with a lighted torch to disinfect the air. Close\r\nbeside them lies a dog dead. To the left one young woman is giving some\r\nremedy in a spoon to another stretched on the ground, while behind them\r\nstand a woman and child, both in tears. Detached incidents fill in the\r\npicture. A woman grasps a delirious man as he escapes from his house.\r\nA man carries off a girl in his arms. A woman tears her hair over the\r\ndead body of her child. A woman draws up food to her window with basket\r\nand cord.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the plague of Ashdod, it is difficult to hazard\r\na guess at the nature of these Biblical plagues. All through the\r\nOld Testament, sword, famine, and pestilence are habitually linked\r\ntogether. As plague has followed the flag of commerce, so famine and\r\ntyphus have followed the flag of war. During the Thirty Years’ War the\r\nwhole of Central Europe was devastated by famine and typhus. They were\r\nrampant in the wake of Napoleon’s armies, and thousands perished of\r\ntyphus during the retreat from Moscow. In the Crimea typhus decimated\r\nthe ill-fed army of the French, and only to-day, as it were, have\r\nwe learnt that the body-louse stands as the connecting link between\r\nfamine and typhus. The eighteenth century in Ireland, even when war was\r\nabsent, was an almost unbroken record of famine and typhus, and Ireland\r\nwas quit of epidemic typhus only when she had so widened her area of\r\nsupplies as to ensure immunity from famine. For her deliverance from\r\ntyphus Ireland is beholden to her potatoes, not to her physicians. In\r\nthe light then of the evidence of modern history, typhus may well have\r\nfigured prominently in the list of Biblical plagues. Still there are\r\nnot wanting many instances in which true plague has followed hard on\r\nthe heels of famine; and in India cholera and dysentery only too often\r\nappear, to complete the work that famine has but half done.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] _Metamorphoses_, vii. 520.\r\n\r\n[2] _Hist.

We have seen it in the Homeric story,\r\nand we see it again, where we should less expect it, in Sophocles.\r\nPestilence still centres round the personality of Apollo, but whereas\r\nin Homer Apollo stays the plague, in Sophocles he is appealed to only\r\nfor knowledge, whereby to stay it. Homer endows him with special power,\r\nSophocles only with special knowledge. In Homer he is the god of the\r\nbright light (φοῖβος), that dispels the darkness of pestilence: in\r\nSophocles his is the light that illumines the dark places of mind.\r\n\r\nThe _Oedipus Tyrannus_ seems to have been first publicly performed\r\nbetween 429-420 B.C., possibly therefore before the plague of Athens\r\nhad finally died out. Sophocles is certainly not describing the plague\r\nof Athens in the guise of a Theban plague, but it must needs have\r\ncoloured his thoughts as well as those of his audience. His description\r\nof the pestilence blighting the crops, and causing murrain among cattle\r\nand disease and death among men, suggests one of the famine plagues\r\ncommon in ancient history. Hesiod[41] was not unaware of them (λιμὸν\r\nὁμοῦ καὶ λοιμόν). Sophocles is the first writer to attempt even in\r\noutline a description of pestilence, and in doing so he has drawn the\r\npicture of pestilence sent by the gods for the punishment of sin. The\r\nway of atonement is sought for at Delphi, and pending this knowledge\r\nsupplication is made to Athena, Artemis, and Apollo, the deities who\r\ncontrol pestilence and have the plague-stricken city in their special\r\nkeeping. Here is the invocation to Apollo, the Delian Healer:\r\n\r\n        Shower from the golden string\r\n        Thine arrows, Lycian King.\r\n        O Phoebe, let thy fiery lances fly\r\n        Resistless, as they rove\r\n        Through Xanthus’ mountain-grove!\r\n    O Theban Bacchus of the lustrous eye,\r\n    With torch and trooping Maenads and bright crown,\r\n    Blaze on the god whom all in Heaven disown.[42]\r\n\r\nSet in this archaic atmosphere the _Oedipus Tyrannus_ reads strange\r\nbeside the realistic record of Thucydides, published only a few years\r\nlater. But Sophocles has given only in outline what Thucydides has\r\ngiven in arresting detail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the historian, the physician, and the man of letters, the account\r\ngiven by Thucydides of the plague of Athens, in the course of the\r\nPeloponnesian War, must stand for all time as one of the most\r\nremarkable documents in the whole annals of pestilence. In view of\r\nthe much greater strength of the Lacedaemonian land-force, it was the\r\nunwavering policy of Pericles to keep the Athenians within their walls,\r\nallowing the Lacedaemonians to exhaust themselves in devastating Attic\r\nterritory, while retaliating on the coasts of Peloponnesus by the\r\nAthenian fleet. Each year, at the approach of the Lacedaemonian army,\r\nthe inhabitants of Attica flocked within the walls of Athens, bringing\r\nwith them all their movable property, after sending their sheep and\r\ncattle to Euboea and the neighbouring islands, so that the added horror\r\nof a great epizootic was averted. The greater number encamped in the\r\nvacant spaces of the city and Piraeus, and in and around the numerous\r\ntemples. Some housed their families in the towers and recesses of\r\nthe city walls, or in sheds, cabins, tents, or even tubs, disposed\r\nthroughout the course of the long walls. This was the overcrowded state\r\nof beleaguered Athens, when pestilence broke out in the second year of\r\nthe Peloponnesian War (430 B.C.), putting the policy of Pericles to a\r\ncrucial test.\r\n\r\nAfter ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians devastated the coastlands\r\nof Attica, first on the south coast, and then on the north. Pericles\r\nforthwith equipped an Athenian naval squadron, and launched his\r\ncounterstroke against the Peloponnese. This fleet carried 4,000\r\nhoplites and 300 cavalry, who ravaged the district round Epidaurus,\r\nand other towns on the adjacent coast. It seems, however, despite the\r\nrumour to the contrary, which Thucydides faithfully records, that\r\nneither the pestilence nor the operations of this expeditionary force\r\nactually accelerated the departure of the Lacedaemonians, for they\r\nstayed 40 days, which was longer than any other stay. Pestilence broke\r\nout in this expeditionary force, and is doubtless the reason that it\r\nreturned without accomplishing more. Plutarch indeed says that the\r\nAthenians would have captured Epidaurus, but for this outbreak of\r\nsickness.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians also sent another fleet this same summer against Potidaea\r\nin Thrace, which was already undergoing a siege at the hands of an\r\nAthenian army. Pestilence worked fearful havoc in this supplementary\r\nforce and spread from it to the troops who were already there,\r\ninvolving a mortality of 1,050 out of a total of 4,000 hoplites, so\r\nthat the expedition was compelled to return and leave the siege to the\r\ntroops that were there before them.\r\n\r\nIn their despair the Athenians vented their angry feelings on Pericles,\r\njust as persons in a delirium, says Plutarch,[43] turn on their\r\nphysician or their father. They urged that the pestilence was due to\r\ncooping up in the city in stifling huts a rural population accustomed\r\nto an open-air existence, so that they conveyed infection to one\r\nanother. But popular resentment subsided as quickly as it arose. In a\r\nnoble speech, which Thucydides reproduces at length, Pericles weaned\r\nthem to a better mind. His own domestic sufferings may have stirred\r\ntheir sympathy. He lost of the pestilence his only two legitimate sons,\r\nXanthippus and Paralus, his sister, and many relatives and friends.\r\nThe death of his favourite son, Paralus, left him with no legitimate\r\nheir to maintain the family and the hereditary sacred rites. ‘That\r\nblow’, says Plutarch,[44] ‘crushed him to earth. He struggled indeed to\r\npreserve his wonted impassiveness and to maintain his serene composure.\r\nBut, as he laid a wreath upon the body and looked upon his dead, the\r\nanguish of it all overwhelmed him, and he burst out wailing and sobbing\r\nbitterly—a thing which in all his life he had never before done.’ The\r\nspectacle of this proud, reserved man, this man who had stood firm as\r\na rock amid the rising tide of popular resentment, humbled before God,\r\nhumiliated before man, as the iron seared his innermost soul, is one of\r\nthe most moving pictures in all history and literature.\r\n\r\n    My God has bowed me down to what I am,\r\n    My solitude and grief have brought me low.\r\n\r\n‘Shortly after this, it appears, the pestilence laid hold on Pericles.\r\nThe attack was not, as in other cases, sharp and severe. It took the\r\nform of an ailment, slight but protracted through a variety of phases,\r\nwhich slowly wasted his strength and undermined the vigour of his\r\nmind.’ But if we may judge by the accounts of his death-bed given by\r\nPlutarch himself, and by Theophrastus in his _Ethics_, his mind was\r\nfree from any taint of insanity.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak of pestilence lasted for two years, from the\r\nspring of 430 B.C. to that of 428 B.C., then came a partial, but not\r\ncomplete, abatement for one and a half years, followed by another\r\noutbreak in 427 B.C. which lasted a year. ‘To the power of Athens’,\r\nsays Thucydides, ‘certainly nothing was more ruinous. Not less than\r\n4,400 Athenian hoplites, who were on the roll, died, and also 300\r\nhorsemen, and an incalculable number of the common people’, estimated\r\nby Diodorus Siculus[45] at 10,000 freemen and slaves. Bury[46] puts the\r\ntotal number of Athenian burghers (of both sexes and all ages) at the\r\ncommencement of the Peloponnesian War at 100,000, and this total was\r\nreduced by the pestilence to some 80,000 or less. The metic class and\r\nthe slaves he estimates roundly at 30,000 and 100,000 respectively,\r\nbut beyond the unreliable statement of Diodorus Siculus, we have no\r\nindex of their reduction. In accepting the verdict of Thucydides on the\r\ndisastrous effects of the pestilence on the power of Athens, we must\r\nnot forget that there were other influences at work, conspiring to this\r\nsame result, the consequences of which Pericles had pointed out clearly\r\nin his speech before the war. Had it not been for these, Athens would\r\nbeyond doubt have rallied quickly from the blow, as we shall see that\r\nother cities have habitually done in like case with hers.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the epidemic broke out a second time in\r\nAthens cannot have differed greatly from those prevailing at its first\r\nonset, for though it was winter and the Lacedaemonian army was not in\r\nthe field, the surrounding country had been devastated, and most of the\r\npeasantry must still have been cooped up, in a state of overcrowding,\r\nwithin the walls. As the pestilence lingered on in Athens, superstition\r\nlaid fast hold on the populace, under the stress of their protracted\r\nsufferings. On the advice of the oracle, they decided to purify\r\nthe island of Delos, which formerly had been dedicated to Apollo,\r\nbut latterly had been used as a burial-ground. All the dead were\r\ntransferred to a neighbouring island Rhene, and a law was passed\r\nforbidding henceforth the burial of a corpse or the birth of a child\r\nin Delos. The neglected panegyric festival of Apollo was also revived\r\nin the island. No stone was left unturned to appease the god, who, the\r\nAthenians now were persuaded, had sent them the distemper.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes and inundations lasted, as did the pestilence, throughout\r\nthe summer of 426 B.C. Diodorus Siculus seems to suggest that the\r\nearthquakes were sent by Apollo, who had been duly propitiated, to\r\ndivert the Lacedaemonians from the invasion of Attica. Actually they\r\ndid effect this, for Agis, King of Sparta, though already arrived\r\nat the isthmus, accepted the omen and led his army back. Neither\r\nThucydides nor Diodorus Siculus asserts any direct causal relation\r\nbetween the earthquakes and the pestilence—a belief, which if now\r\nvaguely foreshadowed, took definite form only at a later date.\r\n\r\nThe following is the full narrative[47] of the pestilence, as given by\r\nThucydides:\r\n\r\n        ‘As soon as summer returned, the Peloponnesian\r\n    army, comprising as before two-thirds of the force\r\n    of each confederate state, under the command of the\r\n    Lacedaemonian king Archidamus, the son of Zeuxidamus,\r\n    invaded Attica, where they established themselves and\r\n    ravaged the country. They had not been there many days\r\n    when the plague broke out at Athens for the first time.\r\n    _It_ is said to have previously smitten many places,\r\n    particularly Lemnos, but there is no record of _so\r\n    great_ a pestilence occurring elsewhere, or of _such_\r\n    a destruction of human life. For a while physicians,\r\n    in ignorance of the nature of the disease, sought to\r\n    apply remedies; but it was in vain, and they themselves\r\n    were among the first victims, because they oftenest\r\n    came into contact with it. No human art was of any\r\n    avail, and as to supplications in temples, enquiries of\r\n    oracles, and the like, they were utterly useless, and\r\n    at last men were overpowered by the calamity and gave\r\n    them all up. The disease is said to have begun south of\r\n    Egypt in Ethiopia: thence it descended into Egypt\r\n    and Libya, and after spreading over the greater part\r\n    of the Persian empire, suddenly fell upon Athens. It\r\n    first attacked the inhabitants of the Piraeus, and it\r\n    was supposed that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the\r\n    cisterns, no conduits having as yet been made there.\r\n    It afterwards reached the upper city, and then the\r\n    mortality became far greater. As to its probable origin\r\n    or the causes which might or could have produced such a\r\n    disturbance of nature, every man, whether a physician\r\n    or not, will give his own opinion. But I shall describe\r\n    its actual _character_, and the symptoms by which\r\n    any one who knows them beforehand may recognize the\r\n    disorder, should it ever reappear. For I was myself\r\n    attacked, and witnessed the sufferings of others.\r\n\r\n        The season was admitted to have been remarkably\r\n    free from ordinary sickness; and if anybody was already\r\n    ill of any other disease, it was absorbed in this.\r\n    Many who were in perfect health, all in a moment, and\r\n    without any apparent reason, were seized with violent\r\n    heats in the head and with redness and inflammation of\r\n    the eyes. Internally the throat and the tongue were\r\n    quickly suffused with blood, and the breath became\r\n    unnatural and fetid. There followed sneezing and\r\n    hoarseness; in a short time the disorder, accompanied\r\n    by a violent cough, reached the chest; then fastening\r\n    lower down, it would move the stomach and bring on all\r\n    the vomits of bile to which physicians have ever given\r\n    names; and they were very distressing. An ineffectual\r\n    retching producing violent _straining_ attacked most of\r\n    the sufferers; some as soon as the previous symptoms\r\n    had abated, others not until long afterwards. The body\r\n    externally was not so very hot to the touch, nor yet\r\n    pale: it was of a livid colour inclining to red, and\r\n    breaking out in pustules and ulcers. But the internal\r\n    fever was intense: the sufferers could not bear to have\r\n    on them even the finest linen garment. They insisted on\r\n    being naked, and there was nothing which they longed\r\n    for more eagerly than to throw themselves into cold\r\n    water. And many of those who had no one to look after\r\n    them actually plunged into the cisterns, for they were\r\n    tormented by unceasing thirst, which was not in the\r\n    least assuaged whether they drank little or much. They\r\n    could not sleep: a restlessness which was intolerable\r\n    never left them. While the disease was at its height\r\n    the body, instead of wasting away, held out amid these\r\n    sufferings in a marvellous manner, and either they died\r\n    on the seventh or ninth day, not of weakness, for their\r\n    strength was not exhausted, but of internal fever,\r\n    which was the end of most; or, if they survived,\r\n    then the disease descended into the bowels and there\r\n    produced violent ulceration; severe diarrhoea at\r\n    the same time set in, and at a later stage caused\r\n    exhaustion, which finally with few exceptions carried\r\n    them off. For the disorder which had originally settled\r\n    in the head passed gradually through the whole body,\r\n    and, if a person got over the worst, would often seize\r\n    the extremities and leave its mark, attacking the privy\r\n    parts and the fingers and the toes; and some escaped\r\n    with the loss of these, some with the loss of their\r\n    eyes. Some again had no sooner recovered than they were\r\n    seized with a forgetfulness of all things and knew\r\n    neither themselves nor their friends.\r\n\r\n        The malady took a form _beyond description_, and\r\n    the fury with which it fastened upon each sufferer\r\n    was too much for human nature to endure. There was\r\n    one circumstance in particular which distinguished it\r\n    from ordinary diseases. The birds and animals which\r\n    feed on human flesh, although so many bodies were\r\n    lying unburied, either never came near them, or died\r\n    if they touched them. This was proved by a remarkable\r\n    disappearance of the birds of prey, who were not to be\r\n    seen either about the bodies or anywhere else: while in\r\n    the case of the dogs the fact was even more obvious,\r\n    because they live with man.\r\n\r\n        Such was the general nature of the disease: I\r\n    omit many strange peculiarities which characterized\r\n    individual cases. None of the ordinary sicknesses\r\n    attacked any one while it lasted, or if they did, they\r\n    ended in the plague. Some of the sufferers died from\r\n    want of care, others equally who were receiving the\r\n    greatest attention. No single remedy could be deemed a\r\n    specific: for that which did good to one did harm to\r\n    another. No constitution was of itself strong enough\r\n    to resist or weak enough to escape the attacks: the\r\n    disease carried off all alike and defied every mode of\r\n    treatment. Most appalling was the despondency which\r\n    seized upon any one who felt himself sickening: for he\r\n    instantly abandoned his mind to despair and, instead of\r\n    holding out, absolutely threw away his chance of life.\r\n    Appalling too was the rapidity with which men caught\r\n    the infection: dying like sheep if they attended on one\r\n    another: and this was the principal cause of mortality.\r\n    When they were afraid to visit one another, the\r\n    sufferers died in their solitude, so that many houses\r\n    were empty because there had been no one left to take\r\n    care of the sick; or if they ventured they perished,\r\n    especially those who aspired to heroism. For they went\r\n    to see their friends without thought of themselves and\r\n    were ashamed to leave them, even at a time when the\r\n    very relations of the dying were at last growing weary\r\n    and ceased to make lamentations, overwhelmed by the\r\n    vastness of the calamity. But whatever instances there\r\n    may have been of such devotion, more often the sick\r\n    and the dying were tended by the pitying care of those\r\n    who had recovered, because they knew the course of the\r\n    disease and were themselves free from apprehension.\r\n    For no one was ever attacked a second time, or with\r\n    a fatal result. All men congratulated them, and they\r\n    themselves, in the excess of their joy at the moment,\r\n    had an innocent fancy that they could not die of any\r\n    other sickness.\r\n\r\n        The crowding of the people out of the country into\r\n    the city aggravated the misery; and the newly-arrived\r\n    suffered most. For, having no houses of their own, but\r\n    inhabiting in the height of summer stifling huts, the\r\n    mortality among them was dreadful, and they perished\r\n    in wild disorder. The dead lay as they had died, one\r\n    upon another, while others hardly alive wallowed in the\r\n    streets and crawled about every fountain craving for\r\n    water. The temples in which they lodged were full of\r\n    the corpses of those who died in them: for the violence\r\n    of the calamity was such that men, not knowing where to\r\n    turn, grew reckless of all law, human and divine. The\r\n    customs which had hitherto been observed at funerals\r\n    were universally violated, and they buried their dead\r\n    each one as best he could. Many, having no proper\r\n    appliances, because the deaths in their household\r\n    had been so frequent, made no scruple of using the\r\n    burial-place of others. When one man had raised a\r\n    funeral pile, others would come, and throwing on their\r\n    dead first, set fire to it; or when some other corpse\r\n    was already burning, before they could be stopped would\r\n    throw their own dead upon it and depart.\r\n\r\n        There were other and worse forms of lawlessness\r\n    which the plague introduced at Athens. Men who had\r\n    hitherto concealed their indulgence in pleasure now\r\n    grew bolder. For seeing the sudden change—how the rich\r\n    died in a moment, and those who had nothing immediately\r\n    inherited their property—they reflected that life and\r\n    riches were alike transitory, and they resolved to\r\n    enjoy themselves while they could, and to think only\r\n    of pleasure. Who would be willing to sacrifice himself\r\n    to the law of honour when he knew not whether he would\r\n    ever live to be held in honour? The pleasure of the\r\n    moment and any sort of thing which conduced to it took\r\n    the place both of honour and of expediency. No fear\r\n    of God or law of man deterred a criminal. Those, who\r\n    saw all perishing alike, thought that the worship or\r\n    neglect of the Gods made no difference. For offences\r\n    against human law no punishment was to be feared: no\r\n    one would live long enough to be called to account.\r\n    Already a far heavier sentence had been passed and was\r\n    hanging over a man’s head: before that fell, why should\r\n    he not take a little pleasure?\r\n\r\n        Such was the grievous calamity which now afflicted\r\n    the Athenians: within the walls their people were\r\n    dying, and without, their country was being ravaged. In\r\n    their troubles they naturally called to mind a verse\r\n    which the elder men among them declared to have been\r\n    current long ago:\r\n\r\n         A Dorian war will come and a plague with it.\r\n\r\n        There was a dispute about the precise expression:\r\n    some saying that _limos_, a famine, and not _loimos_,\r\n    a plague, was the original word. Nevertheless,\r\n    as might have been expected, for men’s memories\r\n    reflected their sufferings, the argument in favour of\r\n    _loimos_ prevailed at the time. But if ever in future\r\n    years another Dorian war arises which happens to be\r\n    accompanied by a famine, they will probably repeat\r\n    the verse in the other form. The answer of the oracle\r\n    to the Lacedaemonians when the God was asked “whether\r\n    they should go to war or not”, and he replied “that if\r\n    they fought with all their might, they would conquer,\r\n    and that he himself would take their part”, was not\r\n    forgotten by those who had heard of it, and they quite\r\n    imagined that they were witnessing the fulfilment of\r\n    his words. The disease certainly did set in immediately\r\n    after the invasion of the Peloponnesians, and did not\r\n    spread to the Peloponnesus in any degree worth speaking\r\n    of, while Athens felt its ravages most severely, and\r\n    next to Athens the places which were most populous.\r\n    Such was the history of the plague.’\r\n\r\nA careful study, line upon line and word by word, of the description\r\nwhich Thucydides has given of the clinical features of the Athenian\r\npestilence, viewing it on the one hand in the light of the medical\r\nknowledge of the time, and on the other in the light of the revelations\r\nof modern pathology, can hardly fail to bring home to an unbiased\r\njudgement the conviction that we have to do with typhus fever. It is\r\ntrue that it bears a close resemblance to Oriental plague, but whereas\r\nthe objections to this diagnosis seem to us to be insuperable, we\r\nshall hope to show that those which hitherto have appeared obstacles\r\nto the diagnosis of typhus fever, are either artificial or based upon\r\nan incorrect interpretation of the text. The confusion of typhus fever\r\nand Oriental plague prevailed down to comparatively modern times even\r\namong medical writers; not only is there a striking resemblance in the\r\nclinical picture of the two diseases, but they have been constantly\r\ncommingled in one and the same epidemic. This is no matter for\r\nsurprise, when we remember that the flea is the chief agent in the\r\npropagation of one disease, and the body-louse of the other.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely a single writer of the sixteenth, seventeenth, or\r\neighteenth centuries on the subject of fevers, who has not commented on\r\nthe concurrence of malignant fevers with epidemics of Oriental plague.\r\nIt is true that they do not all identify the malignant fevers as\r\ntyphus, simply because typhus, though distinguished as a morbid entity\r\nby Fracastorius as early as 1546, did not become generally recognized\r\nthroughout Europe until the eighteenth century, and even then its\r\nidentity was obscured under a multiplicity of synonyms. Ambroise Paré,\r\nin 1568, described a pestilential fever as prevailing in France along\r\nwith true plague, in which the skin was marked with spots, like the\r\nbites of fleas or bugs. Vilalba says that on several occasions during\r\nthe sixteenth century a spotted fever called Tabardiglio, which is\r\nnow known to have been typhus, was rife in Spain at the same time as\r\nplague, and was much confused with it. According to Lotz a malignant\r\nspotted fever was present in London in 1624, which turned to plague\r\nin 1625, and back again to spotted fever in 1626. Similarly Sydenham\r\nstates that the Great Plague of London was preceded and followed by a\r\npestilent fever, which from his description was clearly typhus, and he\r\nremarks that it differed from the plague only in the milder character\r\nof its symptoms. According to Diemerbroeck spotted fever (typhus)\r\npreceded plague in Holland in 1636, and its malignity increased\r\nprogressively, until finally it became converted into true plague. The\r\nsame is true of the plague of Marseilles in 1720, of the plague of\r\nAleppo in 1760, and of the plague of Moscow in 1771. Hancock, in 1821,\r\nasserted that nearly all the most remarkable plagues of the last two\r\ncenturies had been preceded by typhus. So much for the confusion of\r\nthese two diseases, due to their concurrence.\r\n\r\nMurchison, whose treatise on typhus stands out as a monument of acute\r\nand accurate observation, traces out in detail the resemblance of the\r\ntwo diseases. It is no matter only of a general clinical resemblance,\r\nsuch as is common to most acute infectious fevers, though that is\r\nstriking enough, but beyond this there is a remarkable similarity in\r\nparticular symptoms, in clinical course, and in complications. There\r\nis a tendency to regard buboes as a distinctive feature of plague, but\r\nthese are found in a small moiety of cases of typhus fever. On the\r\nother side of the picture, the petechial eruptions of typhus, its most\r\ndistinctive feature, are common enough in plague.\r\n\r\nIt is tempting to shirk the difficulty of a differential diagnosis\r\nby assuming that in Athens, as so often elsewhere, there was a\r\nsimultaneous outbreak of typhus and plague, but the whole evidence\r\npoints strongly to the presence of typhus, and typhus only. We will\r\nendeavour to present the evidence fairly and simply, so that every\r\nreader may form his own conclusion, by reference to the appended\r\nnarrative of Thucydides.\r\n\r\nStarting in Ethiopia rumour had it that the disease spread northwards\r\nto Egypt and Libya, and thence over the greater part of the Persian\r\nEmpire, which at that time included almost all of Western Asia, then\r\nsuddenly it swooped down upon Athens. The same disease was said to have\r\npreviously attacked Lemnos and many other places, but with much less\r\nseverity. With Lemnos Thucydides will have had close acquaintance, for\r\nit lay in the direct route to Thrace, where he owned property. He is\r\ncareful to say that he gives this information as well as that of its\r\nstarting-point and lines of extension only on hearsay evidence. If it\r\nwere really part of one vast pandemic, it is surprising that he should\r\nhave no more certain knowledge of its incidence. True, pestilence\r\nwas raging this self-same year in Rome, but it must not be assumed\r\nthat it was necessarily of the same character as that at Athens. All\r\nthrough the fifth century Rome was seldom without pestilence, and\r\nLivy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus record a succession of epidemics,\r\nsome of several years’ duration, following hard one upon another. If\r\nthe origin in Ethiopia and the subsequent lines of advance are to\r\nbe accepted, this would certainly constitute a weighty argument in\r\nfavour of Oriental plague. Of late years an endemic focus of plague\r\nhas been located in Central Africa, and in its spread the disease\r\nwas following established routes of commerce, as has habitually been\r\nthe case. Pandemicity too is an inherent tendency of plague. Typhus\r\nhas followed for the most part the march of armies, and in the wake\r\nof famine, and has shown but little tendency to adhere to the beaten\r\nroutes of commerce. Typhus has in some instances extended at one and\r\nthe same time over a wide region, but for the most part it has been\r\nover contiguous tracts of land. Thus Hildebrand recorded an epidemic\r\nspreading to the whole of Germany, Galicia, Hungary and the Austrian\r\ncrown-lands.\r\n\r\nThucydides has laid it down that the plague of Athens was an unknown\r\ndisease. Now there is a good deal of evidence to suggest that bubonic\r\nplague was recognized, in its sporadic form, as a clinical entity at\r\nthe time of Thucydides. The language of a passage in the 2nd Book of\r\nthe Epidemics, a treatise of the Hippocratic school, seems hardly\r\nsusceptible of any other interpretation: ὁι ἐπὶ βουβῶσι πυρετοὶ κακόν,\r\nπλὴν τῶν ἐφημέρων, καὶ οἰ ἐπὶ πυρετοῖσι βουβῶνες κακίονες (‘fever\r\nsupervening on buboes is a bad sign, except they be ephemeral: but\r\nbuboes supervening on fever still worse’). The allusions also to\r\nbuboes in Aristophanes are so numerous as almost to preclude any other\r\nconclusion: and it cannot be argued that these were an aftermath of\r\nthe epidemic, for Thucydides[48] implicitly asserts the complete\r\ndisappearance of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of the pestilence first in the Piraeus suggests\r\nimportation by sea. Sea-carriage is far more characteristic of plague\r\nthan of typhus, though typhus has been imported often enough from\r\nIreland into England, and was also brought back to England by the\r\ntroops from Corunna, and to France by the French troops from the\r\nCrimea. On the other hand, it was in Piraeus chiefly that the displaced\r\npeasantry were crowded together promiscuously in small stifling\r\nhabitations, affording just those conditions in which typhus has\r\nhabitually arisen and become epidemic.\r\n\r\nAmong those epidemic diseases, that in past times have devastated\r\nbeleaguered cities, typhus unquestionably holds pride of place. Granada\r\nin 1489, Metz in 1552, Montpellier in 1623, Reading in 1643, Genoa\r\nin 1799, Saragossa in 1808, Dantzig and Wilna in 1813, and Torgau in\r\n1814 all tell the same tale. With our lately acquired knowledge of the\r\ntransmission of typhus fever by the agency of body-lice, it is easy to\r\nunderstand the prevalence of the disease in epidemic virulence among a\r\nbeleaguered and overcrowded garrison. Murchison, whose knowledge and\r\nexperience of typhus were unequalled, unhesitatingly identified the\r\nplague of Athens as typhus, both because of this special circumstance\r\nof its occurrence and because of the clinical picture as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe passing remarks of Thucydides on the causation of the pestilence\r\nshow him not only superior to the superstitious credulity of some of\r\nhis fellow countrymen, but far in advance of the most enlightened\r\nmedical opinion of his day. There were still some in Athens, who put\r\ntheir faith in supplications in temples and inquiries of oracles: but\r\nthese measures were now weighed in the balance and found wanting. The\r\nstern probation of the Persian wars had taught the lesson, that victory\r\nwas the reward of the strong, not the recompense of the devout; and\r\nwith this knowledge perished the whole fabric of Greek polytheism. So\r\nnow most of the populace ascribed the pestilence to natural causation:\r\nthe Lacedaemonians surely had poisoned the wells. From this day\r\nonwards, right down to modern times, this phantom of poison dogs the\r\nfootsteps of pestilence.\r\n\r\nThucydides leaves no doubt whatever as to his own views: he has done\r\nfor good and all with supernatural causation, though he confesses his\r\ninability to identify the precise cause, leaving that for others to\r\nspeculate about. He states and accepts without reserve contagion from\r\nman to man. In this his great contemporary, Hippocrates, lags far\r\nbehind him. The mind of the Father of Medicine was still in bondage\r\nto the early Greek physicists. Conceiving disease to be caused in man\r\nby bodily disturbance, referable either to the character of the air\r\ninspired or of the food and drink ingested, it was inevitable that,\r\nin the causation of epidemic disease, Hippocrates should assign chief\r\nimportance to changes in the atmosphere, to which all alike would\r\nbe equally exposed. He does indeed recognize the possibility of its\r\ncontamination with alien putrid effluvia, but for all that it is the\r\nmere physical changes in its constitution, which in his view are of\r\nparamount importance. Of contagion from man to man he had not the\r\nvaguest conception, and to him, as well as to Galen, and even to our\r\nown Sydenham, the sole criterion of epidemicity was the incidence of\r\ndisease on a large number of persons at the same time.\r\n\r\nTo the student of the history of medicine it will be no matter for\r\nsurprise that Thucydides should have seen with undimmed vision, what\r\nHippocrates saw as yet only through a glass darkly. Medicine in every\r\nage has been the bond-servant of plausible preconceptions, and it is\r\nhumiliating to professional self-complacency to scan the long array\r\nof lay writers from Thucydides onwards, who accepted contagion as a\r\nproven fact, before the scales fell from the eyes of obscurantist\r\nScience. Out of many we may enumerate Aristotle, Lucretius, Diodorus\r\nSiculus, Vergil, Ovid, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Livy, Seneca, Silius\r\nItalicus, the elder Pliny, and Plutarch: while not till Aretaeus of\r\nCappadocia, in the second century after Christ, do we meet clear and\r\nunequivocal acceptance in any medical author. Science, untempered by\r\nletters, is apt to induce a mental myopia, and we men of medicine would\r\ndo well to reflect on the story of Archimedes, who, while drawing\r\nmathematical figures in the sand, overlooked to the cost of his life\r\nthe fact, that the city had fallen into the hands of the enemy.\r\n\r\nThough Thucydides was the first of extant writers to enunciate clearly\r\nthe doctrine of contagion, there is reason to think that Oriental\r\nmedicine had already grasped the idea. The Levitical ordinances seem\r\nto recognize it in the case of leprosy. It is true that these had not\r\nreached their final recension till after the time of Thucydides, but at\r\nthe same time they represent a body of much older tradition.\r\n\r\nThucydides is careful to state that the season was not a sickly one,\r\nfor Hippocrates himself attributed pestilence to heat and south winds\r\ndistempering the atmosphere, and following the example of Acron and\r\nEmpedocles of Agrigentum, essayed to alter the constitution of the\r\natmosphere, in a season of pestilence, by kindling large fires. Acron\r\naimed only at reducing its humidity, but Hippocrates may have sought\r\nto destroy by fumigation putrid effluvia, engendered by the heat\r\nin the air. His example was scrupulously followed in the Plague of\r\nLondon in 1666, and in that of Marseilles in 1720. A comparison of\r\nThucydides with Diodorus Siculus redounds but little to the credit of\r\nthe latter. Diodorus submits three distinct agencies as producing the\r\nplague of Athens by their concerted action. First, that so much rain\r\nhad fallen in the preceding winter, that the soil had become saturated\r\nand waterlogged: following upon this an unusually hot summer led to\r\nthe exhalation from the soil of putrid effluvia, that contaminated the\r\nair. In fact pestilence was a product of the marsh miasma. Empedocles\r\nof Agrigentum was reputed to have delivered Selinus from a pestilence,\r\nin the fifth century B.C., by draining its marshes, and an extant\r\ncoin commemorates the event: and Hippocrates clearly recognized the\r\nassociation of periodic (i. e. malarial) fevers with marshes.\r\n\r\nSecondly, he cites lack of good food as a contributory cause, for\r\nthe rain had also damaged the grain. This was not an unreasonable\r\nproposition, for the prevalence of the ergot fungus in rye grain\r\nafter a wet season has given rise to many and widespread epidemics of\r\nergotism.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Etesian winds did not blow, so that the air became\r\nsuperheated, inflaming men’s bodies with all sorts of burning\r\ndistempers. It is enough for Diodorus that Hippocrates, Lucretius, and\r\nothers had postulated these causes of pestilence, to secure for them\r\nacceptance in the sober record of his history. Thucydides declines\r\neven to discuss such vague hypotheses, and chooses for himself the\r\nbetter part of describing the actual symptoms of the disease, as he\r\nhad experienced them in his own person, and witnessed them in the\r\nsufferings of others, so that any one familiar with them might be able\r\nto recognize the disorder at once, in the event of its reappearance.\r\n\r\nTo Thucydides then is due the credit not only of the first detailed\r\ndescription of an actual visitation of pestilence, but of a description\r\nthat breathes in every line the true spirit of history, the recording\r\nof past events as a medium for the surer forecasting of the future—the\r\nspirit that animates him in all his historical writing to give ‘a true\r\npicture of the events which have happened, and of the like events which\r\nmay be expected to happen hereafter in the order of human things’—the\r\nwhole duty of the historian, which not even Herodotus had recognized\r\nto the full before him. So anxious is he that his readers shall see\r\nthings as he saw them, and learn the same lessons from them as he has\r\nlearnt, that he is willing on occasion to manipulate his narrative,\r\nas when he brings forward the great Funeral Speech of Pericles into\r\nimmediate juxtaposition to the narrative of the pestilence, assuredly\r\nso as to heighten the dramatic effect. So vivid and so forcible is\r\nhis picture of the plague, that it is difficult to believe that some\r\nten years had elapsed before he set pen to paper, and some thirty or\r\nmore before the whole attained its present form. It is no matter for\r\nsurprise that Lucretius, Procopius, Boccaccio, and Froissart should\r\nhave paid the homage of conscious imitation to this virile narrative.\r\n(See Appendix.)[49]\r\n\r\nThucydides was the first to draw a picture of the demoralization\r\nof society in the presence of pestilence—a theme that became a\r\ncommonplace with later historians of plague. The futility of the\r\nphysicians, the merciless march of the pestilence, the sufferings\r\nof the sick, the neglect of the dead, the pollution of temples, the\r\nsacrilegious funeral rites, these scenes and the like throng the\r\nkaleidoscope of human misery. The sacred ties of kinship yielded under\r\nthe cruel emotion of fear. Lawlessness prevailed everywhere, for men\r\nseeing the uncertainty of life and riches resolved to enjoy themselves,\r\nwhile they could. Those who saw all perishing alike thought that\r\nworship or neglect of the gods made no difference.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine what traces of the pestilence are to be\r\nfound in contemporary Greek art and architecture. By some the statue\r\nof Health Athena, set up by the Athenians just outside the eastern\r\nportico of the Propylaea, is believed to have commemorated the passing\r\nof the plague of Athens. Her cult was much older than this, and perhaps\r\nderives from some primitive conception of an Earth Mother, the great\r\nprotectress of all her children, as in Christian hagiology the Madonna\r\nof Health shelters them from plague and pestilence.\r\n\r\nPausanias[50] regards the romantic temple of Apollo at Bassae as\r\na memorial of the deliverance of Phigalia from an offset of this\r\nplague of 430 B.C. He seems to infer this from the dedication of the\r\ntemple to Apollo, under his surname the Helper (Ἐπικούριος). On the\r\nother hand, we know from Thucydides[51] that the plague scarcely\r\ntouched Peloponnesus. It is unlikely also that an Athenian architect,\r\nIctinus, who as Pausanias says built it, would have worked for the\r\nPeloponnesians during the war with Athens.\r\n\r\nThe same doubt attaches to the attribution of the temple of Apollo\r\nthe Helper at Elis, and that of Pan the Deliverer in Troezen, and the\r\ntradition appears in each case to be referable to the surname of the\r\ngod, coupled with the dates at which they were erected.\r\n\r\nPausanias[52] says that a statue of Apollo, Averter of Evil\r\n(Ἀλεξίκακος), by Calamis, was erected in Athens as a memorial of\r\ndeliverance from the plague, but this cannot be the case, as Calamis\r\nwas dead before the plague commenced.\r\n\r\nSuch dedications were, however, common enough. When Epimenides freed\r\nAthens from pestilence he cleansed the city and set up a shrine to\r\nthe Eumenides, and the people of Tanagra[53] similarly showed their\r\ngratitude to Hermes the Ram-bearer (Κριοφόρος) by entrusting to Calamis\r\nthe erection of a statue in his honour.\r\n\r\nPoussin painted a ‘Plague of Athens’, a much cherished picture now in\r\nthe gallery of Sir Frederick Cook at Richmond. It is a dull wooden\r\ncomposition, and compares most unfavourably with his ‘Plague of\r\nAshdod’, in spite of the close similarity of incident and episode that\r\nit depicts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] _Works_, 243.\r\n\r\n[42] Tr.

We shall see how deep an imprint\r\nthey left on the nascent religion, literature, and art of Rome.\r\n\r\nAt first these plagues must needs have been endemic, and bred no doubt\r\nin the extensive swamps that lay within the city and around it for many\r\nmiles, for Rome was not then a commercial city. Her corn she derived\r\nfrom Italy and Sicily, and held little or no intercourse with Egypt,\r\nuntil after the conquest of Carthage. Yet, in spite of the numerous\r\nrecords of her pestilences that have survived, there is not one the\r\nnature of which can be identified before the true Plague of Gregory the\r\nGreat.\r\n\r\nAccording to Plutarch[54] there was pestilence in Italy and Rome in\r\nthe eighth year of Numa Pompilius (707 B.C.), forty-six years after\r\nthe foundation of the city: the legend of it is full of interest.\r\nDuring its course a brazen buckler fell from heaven into the hands\r\nof Numa. Egeria and the Muses told him its meaning. It had been sent\r\nfrom heaven for the preservation of the city, and to prevent its theft\r\neleven more were to be made so exactly like it, that no thief should be\r\nable to distinguish it from the rest. The immediate cessation of the\r\npestilence seemed to verify this interpretation. One Veturius Mamurius\r\nsuccessfully produced the eleven copies, and Numa gave charge of all\r\nthe bucklers to the Salii, so-called from the dance they led up the\r\nstreets, when, in the month of March, they carried the sacred bucklers\r\nthrough the city. ‘On that occasion’, says Plutarch, ‘they are habited\r\nin purple vests, girt with broad belts of brass: they wear also brazen\r\nhelmets, and carry short swords, with which they strike upon the\r\nbucklers, and to those sounds they keep time with their feet. They move\r\nin an agreeable manner, performing certain involutions and evolutions\r\nin a quick measure, with vigour, agility, and ease.... The reward that\r\nMamurius had for his art was, we are told, an ode, which the Salii sung\r\nin memory of him, along with the Pyrrhic dance. Some, however, say that\r\nit was not Veturius Mamurius, who was celebrated in that composition,\r\nbut _vetus memoria_, the ancient remembrance of the thing.’ The legend\r\naffords unmistakable evidence of some expiatory ceremony, first\r\nintroduced for relief of a definite plague, but subsequently, in view\r\nof the constant recurrence, performed twice a year. Plutarch omits one\r\nsignificant feature of the Salic ritual, the driving of a skin-clad\r\nman, called Mamurius Veturius (the old Mars), through the streets,\r\nwhile the Salii showered blows on him, and drove him out of the city.\r\nThe examples in ancient folk-lore[55] of animal and human scapegoats,\r\nfor the exorcising of pestilence are so numerous, that we may well seek\r\nthe interpretation of this Salic ceremony in the persistence of this\r\nconception. The dancing, singing, and clashing of shields was perhaps\r\nintended to drive out the evil demon from the city as a preliminary to\r\ntransferring it to the scapegoat Mamurius. At Tanagra, the youth who\r\nannually carried a ram on his shoulders round the walls of the city,\r\ndid so as a representative of the Ram-bearing Hermes, who averted a\r\nplague in this same fashion.[56]\r\n\r\nPlutarch discusses the meaning of these bucklers, called Ancilia, so it\r\nwas said, from their curved form (ἀγκύλον). He suggests as alternative\r\nderivations, ἀνέκαθεν = from on high: or ἄκεσις = healing of sick: or\r\nαὐχμῶν λύσις = putting an end to drought: or ἀνάσχεσις = deliverance\r\nfrom calamities. But whatever the etymological significance, their\r\nritual purpose would seem to have been to ward off the darts and\r\narrows of pestilence, and the Salic ceremonial was dedicated to the\r\nhonour of the sender. God he was not, for the religion of Numa’s Rome\r\nknew no gods of human form: these were a later importation from the\r\nanthropomorphic religion of Greece. He was some _numen_, some power\r\nless personal than a god, but more personal than a spirit. It was he\r\nthat engendered pestilence by his evil machinations. The legend brings\r\nus back again close to the confines of imitative magic. True, it is not\r\nthe agent of pestilence that is fashioned, not the brazen serpent, not\r\nthe mice, not the emerods, but the agent of deliverance, ‘thy shield\r\nand buckler.’\r\n\r\nIn later years the Salii figure as colleges of priests, dedicated\r\nfirst to the worship of Mars, and later of Quirinus as well. The\r\ntransformation served to obscure their true origin, which Plutarch\r\nasserts and which there is every reason to accept. Mars was not\r\noriginally a god of war, but an agricultural god, and, like Apollo, a\r\nguardian of the crops. Coincidently with the transformation the ritual\r\nassumed a more martial character, the Salii performing the war-dance\r\nin full fighting panoply, as the procession moved through the city\r\ntwice a year, in March and October. The beginning and end of the season\r\nof pestilence had faded insensibly into the beginning and end of the\r\ncampaigning season. Horace[57] recounts the aldermanic magnificence of\r\ntheir festive repast.\r\n\r\nThe hymn of the Salii was written in archaic Saturnian verse, fragments\r\nof which have come down to us. Quintilian[58] says that, by the first\r\ncentury B.C. the primitive language, passed down with verbal exactitude\r\nfrom generation to generation, had become unintelligible to those\r\nwho ceremoniously recited it. One fragment is instructive in its\r\nsignificance:\r\n\r\n    Cumé tonas, Leucésie, prae tet tremonti,\r\n    Quom tibei cunei dextumúm tonárent.\r\n\r\n(‘When thou thunderest, thou god of Light, they tremble at thy\r\npresence, when the lightning shafts have thundered from thy right\r\nhand.’) These lines recall the figure of Apollo the Far-Darter in the\r\n_Iliad_, and his invocation in the _Oedipus Tyrannus_.\r\n\r\nPestilence was in Rome again just before the death of Tullus\r\nHostilius[59] in 640 B.C. Tullus himself fell ill, and in his illness\r\nrevived every superstitious usage, though when in health he had\r\naffected to scorn religion. The people also cherished the conviction\r\nthat only by obtaining pardon of the gods would they be rid of the\r\npestilence. So Tullus consulted the commentaries of Numa, and finding\r\nthat certain sacrifices should have been paid to Jupiter Elicius\r\n(_elicere_ = to elicit information), he set about their performance.\r\nBut as he failed to conduct them in due form, he not only failed of\r\nhis purpose, but so roused the anger of Jupiter, that he struck him\r\nwith lightning and reduced him and his whole household to ashes. Livy’s\r\nstory of Tullus illustrates well the relation of a Roman to his god:\r\nit was a practical, not a spiritual relation, a bargain, not an act\r\nof grace. If the Roman paid all his dues of worship to the god he had\r\na claim to repayment in full. Again and again, under the stress of\r\npestilence, failure of the god to honour his bond drove the Roman to\r\ntry his luck with alien gods. This is the spirit in which Tarquinius\r\nSuperbus,[60] during another plague, in 514 B.C., sent his sons to\r\nGreek Delphi to inquire of the god how to be rid of it. Pestilence, in\r\nthis manner, was destined to forge many a link in the chain that bound\r\nRome to Greece.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century B.C., Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus record\r\na constant succession of plagues in Rome. Eight visitations, at least,\r\nare mentioned, and as some of these lingered over several years, Rome,\r\nin the fifth century, can seldom have been free from pestilence. And\r\nyet all this time she was not only growing, but actually sending out\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nOf a plague in 473 B.C. we have an interesting recital by Dionysius of\r\nHalicarnassus.[61] ‘In the beginning of the year’, he writes, ‘many\r\nprodigies and omens happened, which filled the city with superstition\r\nand fear of the gods: and all the augurs and the interpreters of\r\nholy things declared that these were signs of divine anger, because\r\nsome rites had not been performed with sanctity and purity. Not long\r\nafter, a distemper, supposed to be pestilential, attacked the women,\r\nparticularly such as were with child, and more of them died than had\r\never been known before. For as they miscarried and brought forth\r\ndead children, they died together with their infants. And neither\r\nsupplications at the statues and altars of the gods, nor expiatory\r\nsacrifices performed on behalf of the public and of private families\r\ngave the women any relief.’ Thereupon a slave came forward and\r\ndenounced Urbinia, one of the Vestal Virgins, who tended the perpetual\r\nfire, for impurity. The pontiffs at once removed her from her ministry,\r\nbrought her to trial, convicted her, and condemned her ‘to be whipped\r\nwith rods, to be carried through the city, and buried alive’. One\r\nof her guilty lovers killed himself: the other was ordered to be\r\npublicly whipped like a slave, and then put to death. After this, ‘the\r\ndistemper, which had attacked the women and caused so great a mortality\r\namong them, presently ceased.’ Again, the pestilence is attributed\r\nto the imperfect performance of some detail of ritual, which must be\r\nexpiated forthwith, if the sender of the pestilence is to be appeased.\r\nIts special incidence on women seemed to bring home the guilt to them.\r\nIt was meet therefore that a woman’s life should be its expiation. Such\r\nis the earliest detailed record of human sacrifice for deliverance\r\nfrom plague, but we shall meet it again and again in the history of\r\nepidemic pestilence. Surely the tiger in man is but lightly prisoned in\r\nhis human cage.\r\n\r\nHuman sacrifice was probably world-wide in the earliest ages of\r\nnations. The Phoenicians[62] resorted to it in times of national\r\ncalamity, such as epidemic pestilence. There is abundant evidence from\r\nthe Bible[63] and elsewhere, that human sacrifice was habitual in\r\nprimitive Semitic religion. The Israelites were apt to assert that they\r\nlearnt these practices from the peoples whom they superseded in the\r\nland of Canaan, but it must be remembered that they came of the same\r\nstock as these races. Pausanias[64] refers to the legend of Leos, who\r\nis said to have sacrificed his daughters, at the bidding of the oracle,\r\nto save Athens from a famine; and in speaking of the ruined city of\r\nPotniae[65] he says that the oracle of Delphi told them that they would\r\nget rid of a pestilence only by the sacrifice of a blooming boy to\r\nDionysus, who had sent it for the murder of his priest. At the Athenian\r\nfeast of Thargelia in May, a man and a woman were led through the city\r\nand stoned to death outside its walls, a man for the men, and a woman\r\nfor the women: and a similar practice maintained in the Saturnalia at\r\nRome. But with the advance of civilization animal substitutes came to\r\nreplace the human victims.\r\n\r\nPhilostratus[66] cites another notable instance of human sacrifice for\r\ndeliverance from pestilence. The Ephesians had summoned Apollonius\r\n(first century A.D.) to come and check the plague. On his arrival he at\r\nonce set himself to encourage the citizens, and gathered them together\r\nto the theatre ‘where now stands the statue of Averruncus. Here they\r\nfound an ill-looking old beggar, whom Apollonius ordered them to\r\nstone to death, as being the enemy of the gods. As soon as they set\r\nto stoning him, fire darted from the old beggar’s eyes, so that they\r\nknew him for a demon. After they had killed him, Apollonius ordered\r\nthem to remove the stones from the corpse, and they found instead of a\r\nhuman body a fierce dog vomiting foam, as if mad.... The form this dog\r\nassumed was like that given to the statue of Averruncus.’\r\n\r\nThe blood-lust of panic terror, which found its gratification in the\r\nslaying of Urbinia, is the lineal descendant of the cold-blooded ritual\r\nof human sacrifice: no human passion is so cruel as fear. But we shall\r\nfail to find even this palliation for the torture and killing of the\r\n‘unctores’, both in Genoa and Milan, and for the wholesale massacre of\r\nJews at the time of the Black Death, carried through by legal process\r\nfar more deliberate, far more lengthy, far less impassioned than any\r\nrite of human sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn the pestilence of 461 B.C. the mortality was so great that it became\r\nnecessary to throw the dead bodies into the Tiber. Livy[67] says that\r\na cattle epizootic preceded the epidemic, and that the necessity of\r\nadmitting the cattle within the walls, owing to the invasion of Roman\r\nterritory by the Aequans and Volscians, increased the malignity of the\r\ndistemper. In this crisis of calamities, the Senate ordered the people\r\nto supplicate the protection of the gods. These ‘supplications’ took\r\nthe form of expiatory processions, and seem to have been introduced\r\nfrom Greece to Rome. Like the Salic processions they moved to the sound\r\nof music and singing, as they visited the sanctuaries of the gods,\r\nprostrating themselves before their statues, clasping their knees and\r\nkissing their hands and feet. Livy[68] holds that the guardian gods\r\nand the city’s good fortune saved Rome at this juncture, as fear of\r\nthe pestilence induced the enemy to divert their attack to the richer\r\nand healthy Tusculan territory. Just before this outbreak Livy[69]\r\nsays that the sky seemed to be lit up by an exceeding bright light.\r\nIt is not clear what celestial phenomenon he has in mind, but it is\r\nnoteworthy as perhaps anticipating the fixed belief of later days in\r\ncomets, as harbingers of pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe belief in astral influence over terrestrial phenomena and on the\r\naffairs of humanity was general and dates from prehistoric times.\r\nHippocrates held that every physician should be versed in astrology.\r\nThe dependence of season on the heavenly bodies, and the seasonal\r\nprevalence of epidemic disease were facts patent to every one, so that\r\nit was seemingly reasonable for the ancients to assert the influence of\r\nthe heavenly bodies on disease, though when pushed to excessive lengths\r\nit became absurd. When pestilence was seldom absent, it must needs at\r\ntimes coincide with certain conjunctions of planets. How deeply the\r\nbelief took root in medicine is shown by the words of the preface of\r\nthe German _Herbarius_,[70] first published in A.D. 1485.\r\n\r\n        ‘Many a time and oft have I contemplated inwardly the\r\n    wondrous works of the Creator of the universe: how in the\r\n    beginning He formed the heavens and adorned them with\r\n    goodly, shining stars, to which He gave power and might\r\n    to influence everything under heaven. Also how He formed\r\n    afterwards the four elements: fire, hot and dry—air, hot\r\n    and moist—water, cold and moist—earth, dry and cold—and\r\n    gave to each a nature of its own: and how after this the\r\n    same Great Master of Nature made and formed herbs of many\r\n    sorts and animals of all kinds, and last of all Man, the\r\n    noblest of all created things. Thereupon I thought on the\r\n    wondrous order, which the Creator gave these same creatures\r\n    of His, so that everything, which has its being under\r\n    heaven, receives it from the stars, and keeps it by their\r\n    help.’\r\n\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus[71] records another fearful pestilence\r\nin 451 B.C., which carried off all the slaves and half the citizens\r\nof Rome. The pollution of the Tiber by the dead bodies seemed to\r\nintensify its ravages. Men and cattle perished alike, in and around\r\nRome, and famine followed, because the land was left untilled. As long\r\nas the people had any hopes in the assistance of their own gods, they\r\napproached them with sacrifices and all manner of expiation. But when\r\nthese proved of no avail, they set themselves to introduce foreign\r\ninnovations into the established religion of Rome. We shall see in the\r\nsucceeding visitation, in what direction the disillusioned Romans first\r\ncast their eyes.\r\n\r\nFrom 435-430 B.C. pestilence,[72] following on a drought and cattle\r\nepizootic, raged in Rome and the surrounding country beyond the power\r\nof human endurance. Frequent earthquakes preceded a great access\r\nof virulence in 431 B.C.: the very powers of nature seemed to have\r\ndeclared war on Rome. The people offered a general supplication to\r\nthe gods, repeating the formulas word for word after the duumvirs, so\r\nthat no mistake of word or syllable might invalidate the office: but\r\nin vain. So the worship of Apollo was brought from Greece to Rome, and\r\na temple erected in his honour in 431 B.C. Apollo cannot have been\r\na wholly unfamiliar god, for the Sibylline books must at least have\r\nintroduced his name to Rome. But from this time he becomes naturalized\r\nas a leading Roman god. From his temple, in times of pestilence,\r\nexpiatory processions paraded the streets of the city; and as plague\r\nsucceeds plague, he supplants step by step the older native gods.\r\n\r\nIn 395 B.C. pestilence[73] worked such havoc, that the Senate ordered\r\nthe Sibylline books to be consulted. This collection of oracular\r\nutterances in Greek, given forth by inspired prophetesses or Sibyls\r\n(Σίβυλλα = Doric Σιὸς βόλλα = Διὸς βουλή = will of the god), had found\r\nits way from the Troad to Cumae. Thence Tarquinius Superbus transferred\r\npart to Rome, and laid it up in sacred custody, to be used by order of\r\nthe Senate, in times of national emergency. As these books recognized\r\nthe gods and ritual of the Asiatic Greeks, they played a leading part\r\nin the introduction of Greek gods and Greek ritual into the religion of\r\nRome. On this occasion the Sibylline books prescribed the celebration\r\nof a _lectisternium_.\r\n\r\nThe _lectisternium_, which now first appeared in Rome, was a festival\r\nof Greek origin. A public banquet of great magnificence was set before\r\nthe deities, whose images were placed on couches. The exhibition of\r\nthree pairs of alien gods, Apollo and Latona, Diana and Hercules,\r\nMercury and Neptune, betrayed its foreign origin. The imaginative\r\npopulace saw them accept the food or turn away from it in anger.\r\nMeantime domestic feasts were spread throughout the city, to which\r\nstrangers and friends alike, and even liberated prisoners, came each\r\nto have his share. Doors lay open everywhere, offering a home to every\r\ncasual comer. All things were had in common. No sound of discord marred\r\nthe perfect peace. The people were admitted to solemn communion with\r\nthe gods, as the Greek warriors before Troy shared with their gods in\r\nthe eucharistic feast, in token that the plague was stayed.\r\n\r\nCoincidently with this epidemic at Rome, Diodorus Siculus[74] describes\r\nwith some clinical detail a pestilence that attacked the Carthaginian\r\narmy, while besieging Syracuse. The Lacedaemonians were assisting\r\nDionysius and the Syracusans against the Carthaginians. The record is\r\nof interest as exhibiting Diodorus in the rôle of a flagrant plagiarist\r\nof Thucydides.\r\n\r\n      ‘But as to the Carthaginians, after they had ruined\r\n    the suburbs and rifled and plundered the temples of\r\n    Ceres and Proserpine, a plague seized upon the army,\r\n    and to intensify and sharpen the vengeance of the\r\n    gods upon them, both the season of the year and the\r\n    multitudes of men crowded together contributed greatly\r\n    to the aggravation of their misery: for the summer was\r\n    hotter than ordinarily, and the locality itself\r\n    occasioned the distemper to rage beyond all control.\r\n    Not long before the Athenians were swept away in the\r\n    self-same place by a plague, for it was marshy and\r\n    low-lying ground. At the commencement of the distemper,\r\n    before the sun rose, their bodies would fall a-shaking\r\n    and trembling, through the coldness of the air that\r\n    came off the water: but about noon they were stifled\r\n    with the heat, because they were pent up so closely\r\n    together. The south wind brought in the infection\r\n    among them, and swept them away in heaps, but for a\r\n    while they buried their dead. But when the number of\r\n    the dead increased to such an extent that even those\r\n    in attendance on the sick were cut off, none durst\r\n    approach the infected, for the distemper seemed to\r\n    be incurable. For first catarrhs and swellings about\r\n    the neck (περί τὸν τράχηλον ὁἰδήματα) were caused by\r\n    the stench of the bodies that lay unburied, and by the\r\n    putrefaction of the soil. Then followed fever, pain\r\n    in the muscles of the spine, heaviness of the limbs,\r\n    dysentery and pustules (φλύκταιναι) over the surface of\r\n    the whole body. The majority suffered in this manner,\r\n    but others became raving mad and forgot everything,\r\n    and rushing about distracted struck every one that\r\n    they met. All the help of the physicians was in vain,\r\n    both by reason of the violence of the distemper and\r\n    the suddenness with which it carried many off: for in\r\n    the midst of terrible suffering they commonly died on\r\n    the fifth or at latest the sixth day: so that those\r\n    who died in battle were accounted fortunate by all.\r\n    And it was further a matter of observation, that all\r\n    who attended on the sick died of the same distemper,\r\n    and what aggravated the misery was that none would\r\n    willingly come near the distressed and exhausted, to\r\n    minister to them. For not only strangers, but even\r\n    brothers and familiar friends were driven by fear of\r\n    infection to forsake one another.’\r\n\r\nDiodorus seems to have drawn on the clinical symptoms of several\r\ndifferent diseases, to heighten the effect of his description. The\r\ncombination of pustules on the body with swellings about the neck\r\nsuggests true plague, but there the likeness ends. There are other\r\ndescriptions of pestilence in Diodorus Siculus, that exhibit this same\r\neclectic tendency.\r\n\r\nIn 363 B.C., after one or two intervening milder outbreaks, another\r\nperiod of pestilence[75] set in in Rome. Plutarch says that it carried\r\noff a prodigious number of the people, most of the magistrates and\r\nCamillus himself. When all else failed to appease the gods, scenic\r\nplays were imported from Etruria. Hitherto the Roman people had had\r\nonly the games of the circus. Livy describes their introduction to\r\nRome in minute detail, tracing the development of regular stage plays\r\nfrom these rude scenic shows. ‘Actors’, he says, ‘were sent for from\r\nEtruria, who without any song or imitative gestures regulated their\r\nmovements by the measures of the music, and exhibited in Tuscan fashion\r\nby no means ungraceful dances.’ To the ancients the movements of the\r\nbody spoke a language as familiar as the movements of the tongue. ‘It\r\nseemed to me’, he continues, ‘that the first origin of plays should be\r\nnoticed, that it might appear how from a modest beginning they have\r\nreached their present extravagance. However, the first introduction of\r\nplays, intended as a religious expiation, neither relieved their minds\r\nfrom religious awe, nor their bodies from disease.’ Indeed the Tiber\r\ninundated the circus and interrupted a performance, as though the gods\r\ndespised their efforts at atonement. So popular amusement had come at\r\nlast to supplant popular atonement, giving birth in the process to\r\ndramatic entertainment. In this respect we shall find history repeat\r\nitself with striking similarity in the plague times of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin and the evolution of the scenic plays (_ludi\r\nscenici_), introduced in the first place to divert the mind and\r\ndistract the spirit from the crushing catastrophe of pestilence. The\r\nvisitation was followed by an earthquake, which is said to have opened\r\na gaping abyss in the Forum, into which Manlius Curtius hurled himself\r\nin full armour—a willing human scapegoat sacrificed to the angry gods.\r\n\r\nWhen these various measures failed to allay the pestilence, an old\r\ncustom of driving a nail into the temple of Jupiter was solemnly\r\nrevived. This practice in its inception purposed to make a calendar\r\nof years. But once when a dictator had driven in the nail, forthwith\r\na pestilence had ceased. So now it was urged that, if a dictator and\r\nno common magistrate drove in the nail, the pestilence would cease.\r\nSo says Livy, but there is abundant evidence, both from ancient\r\nliterature and from modern folk-lore, that he has missed the real\r\nsignificance of the act. We find traces of a world-wide belief in\r\nthe possibility of transferring the evils of the body, as well as\r\nthe evils of the soul, to some other being or animal, or thing. The\r\nscapegoat is familiar to all, and we know from Leviticus,[76] that at\r\nthe cleansing of a leper the Jews let a bird fly away. Pliny[77] too\r\ntells us, that a Roman cure for epilepsy was to drive a nail into the\r\nground, where the epileptic’s head had struck it on falling: a similar\r\ncure for toothache was practised in France and Germany, and for ague\r\nin Suffolk.[78] In each instance the idea was to nail fast the evil\r\nthing, and so hinder it from returning to trouble its former host. A\r\nstory given by L. Strackerjan,[79] and quoted by Frazer, comes even\r\nmore closely to the point. During the Thirty Years’ War pestilence came\r\nfrom Neuenkirchen, in Oldenburg, to a neighbouring farmhouse in the\r\nsemblance of a blue vapour, and entering the house found its way into a\r\nhole in the door-post. The farmer seized a peg and hammered it into the\r\nhole, so that it should not come out. After a time he drew out the peg,\r\nbelieving the danger was past, but out came the blue vapour once more.\r\nEvery member of the unhappy household fell a victim to the pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn 348 B.C. pestilence[80] was again rife, and a _lectisternium_ was\r\nobserved at the instance of the Sibylline books.\r\n\r\nIn 331 B.C. Rome was again in the grip of a devastating pestilence.[81]\r\nNumbers of the Senate had already perished, when a female slave came\r\nto the aediles and declared that the victims had died of poison. She\r\nwould show them matrons actually engaged in compounding poisons, and a\r\nstore laid up in readiness for use. Sure enough, drugs were found in\r\nthe possession of two women of patrician rank, Cornelia and Sergia, and\r\nin spite of their protest that these were harmless, they were compelled\r\nto swallow them, and fell victims to their own nefarious devices. One\r\nhundred and seventy matrons were implicated in their guilt, and paid\r\nthe penalty with their lives. Rome offered a human holocaust to the\r\nspirit of panic fear.\r\n\r\nThe grim suspicion of poison was not now formulated for the first time,\r\nfor the Athenians had suspected the Lacedaemonians of poisoning their\r\nwells. But now the charge appears as a deadly and insidious weapon,\r\nready to the hand of every infamous or ill-disposed informer. The\r\nhideous catalogue of cruelties inflicted on innocent victims, under the\r\nspell of this illusion, forms a dark chapter in the history of epidemic\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nIn the face of another pestilence[82] in 312 B.C., a dictator was again\r\nappointed to drive a nail into the temple of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the succession of Rome’s epidemics almost unbroken\r\nthroughout the fourth and fifth centuries. We are accustomed to think\r\nof Roman character as trained in the school of interminable warfare,\r\nbut we are apt to forget that there was another, a sterner and more\r\ndesolating enemy, almost always alert within her gates, ‘the pestilence\r\nthat walketh in darkness.’ In the perpetual struggle for existence on\r\nthe stricken fields of battle and of pestilence, young Rome had found,\r\nas yet, no leisure for the loftier pursuits of the human intellect, and\r\nhad developed no literature and no art of her own, worthy of either\r\nname. As Greek and Roman were alike children of one common stock, some\r\nstrong abiding influences must have been at work, leading development\r\nalong widely divergent paths: and perhaps in epidemic pestilence, with\r\nwhich Greece was but little familiar till the end of the fifth century\r\nat least, we may look for one such agency.\r\n\r\nIn 295 B.C., during a fierce pestilence, Livy[83] says that the\r\nconsul’s son built a temple to Venus, close to the circus out of fines\r\ninflicted on some matrons convicted of adultery, as though their sin\r\nwas believed to be its cause. In the Middle Ages likewise we shall find\r\nmany churches built in commemoration of particular plagues.\r\n\r\nOnly two years later a violent pestilence[84] drove the magistrates\r\nto consult the Sibylline books, and in obedience to their instruction\r\nambassadors were sent from Rome to Epidaurus to demand the serpent of\r\nAesculapius, in which the god seemed to be incarnate. At first nothing\r\nwas done beyond devoting one day to the supplication of Aesculapius.\r\nBut in the following year ambassadors set out under the leadership of\r\nQuintus Ogulnius[85] and on arrival at Epidaurus were taken to the\r\ntemple of Aesculapius, and invited to carry away whatever was needed to\r\nrescue their city from pestilence. Thereupon the serpent, which rarely\r\nappeared to the Epidaurians, presented itself for three days in the\r\nmost public parts of the city, and then of its own accord made its way\r\nto the Roman galley, in which it was transported to Antium, after the\r\nambassadors had been instructed how to pay honour to the god. After a\r\nbrief sojourn there it re-entered the Roman galley, and scarce had they\r\nreached the Tiber, when it swam to the island in mid-stream, where a\r\ntemple was dedicated afterwards to Aesculapius. A coin of Commodus[86]\r\nand a medallion of Antoninus (see Plate I, p. 4) survive to commemorate\r\nthe event. To this day there may be seen on some large blocks of stone,\r\nmoulded to the shape of the poop of a ship, on the Isola Tiberina, the\r\nhead of an effigy of Aesculapius in relief, with the serpent twined\r\nround his staff.\r\n\r\nSo it was pestilence that brought Aesculapius to Rome, as it had\r\nbrought Apollo before him. In this temple in the Tiber the healing\r\nritual of the god flourished for some centuries, and in recent\r\nexcavations many votive emblems of diseased parts of the body have been\r\nbrought to light. With few intervals, and those of no long duration,\r\nthe island has been dedicated to works of healing down to the present\r\nday. Claudius ordained that sick slaves should be exposed on the\r\nisland, and those that recovered were to receive their freedom. The\r\nhospital of S. Giovanni Calabita, founded in 1575, stands there still.\r\nIn 1656 the whole island was converted into a lazaretto for the victims\r\nof the plague.\r\n\r\nIt was the constant custom of the priests of Epidaurus, in founding a\r\nnew shrine to send out one of the sacred snakes from the sanctuary.\r\nPausanias[87] describes the coming of Aesculapius from Epidaurus to\r\nSicyon, in the form of a snake, in a car drawn by a pair of mules.\r\n\r\nBefore his transference to Rome, Aesculapius had already attained all\r\nthe attributes of divinity. He had ceased to be a mere god-man by the\r\ntime that his worship reached Athens from Epidaurus (420 B.C.). So\r\nfar was his serpent origin forgotten, that the Greeks explained his\r\nassociation with the serpent by the suggestion that medicine, like the\r\nserpent, reappeared annually in a fresh integument.\r\n\r\nIn computing the number of epidemics that visited Rome Livy is the\r\nchief authority, and in doing so it must be borne in mind that his work\r\nis incomplete. Epitomes only survive of the books dealing with the\r\nyears from 293 to 219 B.C., and of those again from 167 B.C. to the end\r\nof his history in the middle of the reign of Augustus. That there was\r\nno cessation of the frequent recurrence of pestilence may reasonably\r\nbe inferred from the regularity of appearance in those intervening\r\nyears, of which his complete histories survive.\r\n\r\nIn 212 B.C. Livy[88] describes simultaneous pestilence at Syracuse\r\nand at Rome. The Roman general, Marcellus, was besieging Syracuse,\r\nwhen pestilence fell both on besiegers and besieged. The Carthaginian\r\nand Sicilian armies, however, suffered more than the Romans, who\r\nretired within the walls to recruit their health. The Sicilians also\r\nshook it off by dispersing to their cities, but it continued to rage\r\namong the Carthaginians, who had no place to which to retire. Livy’s\r\ndescription of the neglect of the dead recalls that of Thucydides, but\r\nthe similarity of expression is not so close as to make it certain\r\nthat he has borrowed directly from Thucydides. He writes: ‘At last\r\ntheir feelings had become so completely brutalized by being habituated\r\nto these miseries, that they not only did not follow their dead with\r\ntears and decent lamentations, but they did not even carry them out and\r\nbury them: so that the bodies of the dead lay strewn about, exposed to\r\nthe view of those who were awaiting a similar fate. And thus the dead\r\nwere the means of destroying the sick, and the sick those who were in\r\nhealth, both by fear and by the filthy state and the noisome stench of\r\ntheir bodies. Some, preferring to die by the sword, even rushed upon\r\nthe outposts of the enemy.’ Livy might well have been describing the\r\nscenes in the streets of Marseilles during the plague of A.D. 1720.\r\nSilius Italicus[89] has described this pestilence, as well as Livy, but\r\nhis is a mere poetic picture of its fancied incidence first on dogs,\r\nnext on birds, then on wild beasts, and finally on man.\r\n\r\nThe Ludi Apollinares also were instituted in 212 B.C., but Livy states\r\nthat they were instituted in commemoration of the victory in arms,\r\nand not because of the restoration of a state of healthiness, as is\r\ncommonly supposed. In the circumstances the one proposition need hardly\r\nexclude the other.\r\n\r\nFor three full years, from 183 to 180 B.C., pestilence[90] raged in\r\nRome, carrying off both high and low. The people saw in it a sign of\r\ncelestial anger, and the Pontifex Maximus ordered that the Sibylline\r\nbooks should be consulted. Gilded statues and offerings were duly vowed\r\nto the healing deities, Apollo, Aesculapius, and Hygieia, who for long\r\nyears in the person of Athena had stood as protectress of the health\r\nof Athens. Pestilence had now brought her to Rome. A supplication was\r\ncelebrated in town and surrounding country by all above the age of\r\ntwelve, the suppliants wearing chaplets on their heads and carrying\r\nin their hands boughs of the laurel, sacred to Apollo. Suspicions of\r\npoison were freely bruited in the city, and Valerius of Antium says\r\nthat an investigation actually resulted in the condemnation of two\r\nthousand persons, and among them Quarta Hostilia, wife of the consul\r\nwho had died of the pestilence. So splendid an atonement must needs\r\nappease the angered gods.\r\n\r\nIn 176-175 B.C. pestilence was again severe in Rome. Livy’s[91] account\r\nof it is interesting, because he states that, in spite of the great\r\nmortality among cattle and men, there were no vultures to be seen in\r\neither year of the pestilence. Taking the observation in its context\r\nit reads as though the vultures were the first to suffer, so that\r\nthey were exterminated locally, then the cattle, and afterwards man,\r\nand with him probably his dog. Thucydides had already drawn attention\r\nto the absence of vultures during the plague of Athens, and with the\r\npassage of years the observation crystallized into an article of faith\r\npertinent to all and every pestilence. In the case of the plague of\r\nAleppo Russell definitely negatives the observation.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of Livy’s history we enter on a barren period in\r\nthe history of Roman pestilence, and we may turn for a while to some\r\naspects of pestilence presented by ancient Latin poetry.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] _Life of Numa._\r\n\r\n[55] Frazer, _Golden Bough_.\r\n\r\n[56] Pausanias, ix. 22. 1.\r\n\r\n[57] _Odes_, I. 37.\r\n\r\n[58] I. vi. § 40.\r\n\r\n[59] Livy, i. 31.\r\n\r\n[60] Livy, i. 56, and Dion.

His prime motive\r\nin its introduction is to show that the chief phenomena of nature,\r\nand pestilence as one of these, all harmonize with the atomic theory,\r\nthat he has adopted from Democritus and Epicurus. Lucretius indeed\r\npropounds an atomic explanation of pestilence, consonant in its main\r\nfeatures with the doctrines of his contemporary Asclepiades. We can\r\nreason of the imperceptible, he argues, only from our knowledge\r\nof the perceptible. Our eyes see clouds descend from the sky, and\r\nnoxious vapours rise as mists from the land. Our minds then may not\r\nunreasonably infer, that pestilence also either comes down from heaven\r\nby the medium of clouds, or rises up from the rain-sodden earth by the\r\nmedium of mist. In each manner the atmosphere becomes impregnated with\r\nnoxious atoms that distemper it. These particles enter our bodies,\r\neither by the air we breathe, or by the food and drink they have\r\ncontaminated, and thus provoke infection. Such, he holds, was the cause\r\nof the plague of Athens.\r\n\r\nThe views of Lucretius as to the proximate causes of pestilence are\r\nalmost identical with those of his contemporary, Diodorus Siculus.\r\nWith each of them moisture, as cloud or mist, distempers the air or\r\ndamages food, and so finds entry into lungs or stomach. With each an\r\nill wind may engender pestilence: with Lucretius, by bringing a harmful\r\nto replace a beneficent atmosphere: with Diodorus Siculus, by failing\r\nto cool the air to an appropriate temperature, thus causing fever. To\r\nLucretius clouds, mists, and winds are carriers of noxious particles.\r\nIn this atomic theory of infection he faintly foreshadows the doctrine\r\nof particulate poisons, that held the field of scientific speculation\r\nwithin the memory of living men. But even so Lucretius came less near\r\nthe truth than his great contemporary Varro,[92] who actually ascribes\r\ndisease in animals to living organisms beyond the range of human vision\r\n(‘crescunt animalia quaedam minuta, quae non possunt oculi consequi, et\r\nper aera, intus per os ac nares perveniunt atque efficiunt difficiles\r\nmorbos’).\r\n\r\nTo Lucretius pestilence is a purely natural process, in which there\r\nis no place for the handiwork of gods. Of this theme, in varying\r\napplications, he is a fierce exponent throughout the length and breadth\r\nof his poem. Perhaps it is for this reason that he chose the narrative\r\nof Thucydides as the basis of his poem, for Thucydides, too, referred\r\nepidemic pestilence to natural causation, not to the special act of\r\nany god. Like Thucydides, too, Lucretius accepts without reserve the\r\ndoctrine of contagion:\r\n\r\n     Qui fuerant autem praesto contagibus ibant\r\n     Atque labore.\r\n\r\n    (Those who had stayed near at hand would die of contagion\r\n     and the toil.)\r\n\r\nPestilence, too, affords Lucretius a rare text for the exposure of the\r\nhollow sham of state-worship, which represented now all that survived\r\nof religion in Rome. We have seen how much of Roman religion had its\r\norigin from time to time in the necessity of exorcising pestilence:\r\nand we have seen how popular superstition revivified the ritual of\r\npopular atonement. Now the Sibylline books are consulted. Now a nail is\r\ndriven into the temple of Jupiter. Now Apollo is brought to Rome, and\r\na temple erected in his honour. Now Aesculapius comes in the form of a\r\nserpent to deliver Rome: now Hygieia. Now sacrifices are offered and\r\nfeasts set out before the statues of the gods. This is the fabric that\r\nLucretius, fired with iconoclastic zeal, would fain demolish, not as\r\nthe enemy of religion, but as the ruthless enemy of religious sham.\r\n\r\nIn literary form this part of the great Lucretian poem falls far below\r\nthe rest. The poem as a whole possesses a rugged grandeur of its own,\r\nbut this terminal portion, while retaining all the ruggedness, has lost\r\nmost of the grandeur. It gives the impression of having been merely\r\nrough cast, to await the polishing, which, owing to the premature death\r\nof the poet in 55 B.C., it never received. Fault also may be found with\r\nthe literary substance, for in places he misunderstands the language\r\nof Thucydides, and misrepresents his meaning. Again, he incorporates\r\nhere and there fragments of Hippocrates and fancies of his own into the\r\nrecord of Thucydides, as though all disease presented a single clinical\r\nfacies. For example, he reproduces as _cor_ the καρδία of Thucydides,\r\nwhich the latter used, as did Hippocrates, for the cardiac end of\r\nthe stomach. Again, he misinterprets Thucydides with regard to the\r\neffect of the disease on the extremities. He represents στερισκόμενοι\r\nτούτων as _ferro privati_, whereas clearly Thucydides means that\r\nthe parts sloughed off, not that they were amputated. It would seem\r\nthat Lucretius was versed in the Greek language of his day, but that\r\nlanguage was no longer the Greek of Thucydides and Plato. Nor does\r\nLucretius scorn the full licence that Horace accords to the poet, and\r\nexigencies of metre sometimes compel him not to adhere strictly to his\r\nmodel: thus he transforms the critical days into the eighth and ninth.\r\nOne long passage beginning\r\n\r\n    Multaque praeterea mortis tum signa dabantur\r\n\r\nconsists of various excerpts from Hippocrates turned into Latin verse.\r\nThese are gathered from such diverse parts of the Hippocratic writings,\r\nas to indicate considerable acquaintance with them. The lineaments\r\nof the Hippocratic facies are reproduced in detail. The fact is\r\nthat Lucretius was more anxious for the picturesqueness than for the\r\naccuracy of his description, provided always that the logical soundness\r\nof the main thesis and its didactic purpose were not compromised\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nIn his picture of the mythical plague that afflicted the people\r\nof Aegina, Ovid[93] exacts contributions alike from Thucydides,\r\nLucretius, and Vergil, while there are certain features that bear\r\na strong resemblance to Diodorus Siculus. His story is that Minos,\r\nKing of Crete, the second king of the name, goes in quest of allies\r\nto the island of Aegina, and courts unsuccessfully the aid of its\r\nking Aeacus. As soon as he has departed, Cephalus comes as ambassador\r\nfrom Athens and obtains help from Aeacus, who gives him an account of\r\nthe pestilence that had formerly raged in Aegina, and dwells on its\r\nmarvellous repeopling. Ovid maintains sufficient independence of his\r\nmodels for us to be able to gather something at least of current ideas\r\nof pestilence, set though it is in an atmosphere of antiquity. At first\r\nthe disease was referred to natural causation and so was combated by\r\nmedicines:\r\n\r\n    Dum visum mortale malum tantaeque latebat\r\n    Causa nocens cladis, pugnatum est arte medendi.\r\n    Exitium superabat opem, quae victa iacebat.\r\n\r\nThe tendency was now to regard pestilence as a natural process, until\r\nit overstepped habitual limitations, and triumphantly defied the\r\nresources of orthodox medicine. Then popular imagination saw in it the\r\nhand of a god, and forthwith set it outside the confines of recognized\r\npathology. So now Ovid ascribes the Aeginetan plague to the anger of\r\nJuno, because the island was named after her adulterous rival Aegina,\r\nwho was carried there by Jupiter, and by him became the mother of\r\nAeacus, King of Aegina. But side by side with this Ovid lays stress\r\non various meteorological phenomena, that accompanied or preluded the\r\npestilence—the earth encompassed with gross darkness, a drowsy heat\r\nin the clouds, and persistent hot winds, as though he believed in some\r\nclose causal connexion. He conceives the virus to be communicable in\r\nwater, for fountains and lakes were deemed to be infected, and the\r\nrivers tainted with the venom of innumerable snakes. He dwells at\r\nlength on the epizootic, and elaborates this feature far more even than\r\nLivy, and true to the habitual character of Roman pestilence, he makes\r\nit precede the human epidemic. He holds fast the doctrine of contagion,\r\nwhich he conceives to be transmitted by the dead as well as the living.\r\nOvid’s description of pestilence unmasks his shallow nature. He shows\r\nhimself to be no more and no less than an elegant literary trifler.\r\nOne feels in the easy flow of his verse and the light vagaries of his\r\npicturesque imagination an unconcern and indifference to the horrible\r\nrealities he handles. He has no power, like Thucydides, to plumb the\r\ndepths of pathos, and the reader turns from his catalogue of sufferings\r\nwith no emotion of horror, still less with one of sympathy. One looks\r\nin vain for some vestige of the moral earnestness of Lucretius. Even\r\nfor his deities the springs of action reside in the lowlier human\r\npassions. Caprice and jealousy move Juno to send the pestilence:\r\nhumanity is the sport of these infirmities. When man’s conception of\r\nDivine Providence had sunk so low, it was well that Imperial Rome\r\nshould be without religion.\r\n\r\nManilius, in his _Astronomica_,[94] composed about the Christian era,\r\nasserts with confidence, that comets presage pestilence. The belief\r\nis probably far older than Manilius, though it is difficult to cite\r\nexact authorities. Livy[95] speaks of a bright light in the sky before\r\nthe plague of 462 B.C.; ‘coelum ardere visum est plurimo igni’: and\r\nDionysius of Halicarnassus[96] recounts the lighting up of a fire in\r\nthe heavens before that of 450 B.C.: ἐν οὐρανῷ σέλα φερόμενα καὶ πυρὸς\r\nἀνάψεις. Allusions such as these would seem to signify the appearance\r\nof a comet. Vergil[97] is even more explicit:\r\n\r\n    Non secus ac liquida si quando nocte cometae\r\n    Sanguinei lugubre rubent, aut Sirius ardor,\r\n    Ille sitim morbosque ferens mortalibus aegris\r\n    Nascitur, et laevo contristat lumine coelum.\r\n\r\nOf their supposed malign influence on human affairs in general there is\r\nno doubt. Tacitus[98] assigns to them even a political significance,\r\nfor he says that in popular opinion they always portend a revolution to\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\nSeneca,[99] in his _Physical Science_, makes the specific statement\r\nthat ‘after great earthquakes it is usual for a pestilence to\r\noccur’. The concurrence of the two had been mentioned previously by\r\nThucydides, Diodorus Siculus, Livy, and others, but Seneca would seem\r\nto be the first to attempt to define the exact relation of the one\r\nto the other. In the Campanian earthquake of A.D. 63 a flock of 600\r\nsheep had perished mysteriously, near Pompeii. Seneca conceives that\r\nearthquakes liberate poisonous fumes imprisoned in the earth, or pent\r\nup in marshes, which serve to taint the air. Flocks suffer most, he\r\nthinks, because they live in the open, and also drink the poison-laden\r\nwater. They feed too with heads close to the ground and so receive the\r\nconcentrated venom, before it has become diluted: and then he adds: ‘If\r\nit had issued in greater volume, it would have injured man too, but\r\nthe abundant supply of pure air counteracted it, before it could rise\r\nhigh enough to be breathed by any human being.’ And he proceeds: ‘The\r\nbetter is ever conquered by the worse. Even that pure air of heaven\r\nchanges then to pestilential. Thence come sudden and continuous deaths,\r\nand portentous forms of disease, that spring from unexampled causes.\r\nThe disaster is long-or short-lived according to the strength of the\r\nsources of infection. Nor does the plague cease, until the freedom of\r\nheaven and the tossing of the winds have banished that fatal air.’\r\n\r\nSeneca had probably stumbled on the true explanation of the death of\r\nthe Campanian sheep, for Geikie says that after an eruption of Mount\r\nVesuvius the escape of carbonic acid gas has been known to suffocate\r\nhundreds of hares, partridges, and pheasants. Seneca, in conformity\r\nwith the learned opinion of his time, regards volcanoes and earthquakes\r\nas closely allied phenomena. Earthquakes were regarded as the product\r\nin the main of violent commotion of the air. Niebuhr, like Seneca,\r\nexpressed a firm belief in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions as causes\r\nof pestilence, a thesis that many writers have sought to substantiate.\r\nIt is tempting, even to-day, to speculate on migrations of rats set in\r\nmotion by subterranean activity. But a careful survey of a sufficient\r\nseries of earthquakes and plagues lends little support to such a\r\nproposition. Each may occur alike before or after, with or without the\r\nother, and their frequent concurrence in ancient history denotes no\r\nmore than that the eyes of historians were focused, almost exclusively,\r\non a narrow tract of land around the shores of the Mediterranean, in\r\nwhich earthquakes were and are notoriously of frequent occurrence.\r\nTwo years after the great earthquake Campania was devastated by a\r\nhurricane, and Rome desolated by pestilence. Tacitus[100] says that the\r\npestilence swept away ‘all classes of human beings without any such\r\nderangement of the atmosphere as to be visibly apparent. Yet the houses\r\nwere filled with dead bodies and the streets with funerals.’ Tacitus\r\ndeclares unhesitatingly for the production of pestilence by natural and\r\nnot by supernatural agency.\r\n\r\nThe year A.D. 79 is ever memorable for the destruction of Herculaneum\r\nand Pompeii. It was followed by pestilence, which Dion Cassius\r\nattributes to ashes from Vesuvius. Dust had been suspect from the\r\nremotest ages of antiquity. At the time of the Exodus Moses was told to\r\nsprinkle dust before heaven. ‘And it shall become dust in all the land\r\nof Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man.’\r\nLivy and Plutarch each attributed the plague that broke out among the\r\nGauls, when besieging Rome under Brennus, to the dust and ashes of the\r\nhouses they had burnt. Philo, too, ascribes a pestilence of about the\r\nyear A.D. 92 to hot dust irritating the skin.\r\n\r\nDion Cassius[101] mentions a plague that broke out in the reign of\r\nDomitian (A.D. 81-96), and which may be the same as that mentioned\r\nby Philo. ‘Certain individuals’, he says, ‘poisoned needles and set\r\nto work to prick whomsoever they wished: several who were pricked\r\ndied without knowing anything about it: but some of the scoundrels\r\nwere denounced and punished; and that happened not only in Rome, but\r\nover all the world so to say.’ Some initial punctiform eruption may\r\nperhaps have simulated a needle-prick. Belief in the dissemination\r\nof pestilence by the cutaneous inoculation of poison was destined to\r\nflourish for many centuries. Dion Cassius[102] himself repeats the\r\nstatement in the case of another pestilence in the reign of Commodus\r\n(A.D. 187): ‘In the reign of Commodus occurred the most violent\r\nsickness I have ever known: at Rome two thousand persons often died in\r\na single day. But many died, not only in Rome, but in all parts of the\r\nempire, in another manner: scoundrels, poisoning little needles with\r\ncertain noxious substances, transmitted the disease in this way for\r\npay: this had been done already in the reign of Domitian.’ For three\r\nyears then famine and pestilence worked hand in hand to ruin Rome, and\r\nthe people in their fury clamoured for a victim. A pleasant sacrifice\r\nwas handy in the Phrygian freedman Cleander, the greedy and infamous\r\nminister of Commodus. It was eagerly bruited that Cleander had hoarded\r\nwheat, and the maddened populace, surging to the palace of Commodus,\r\nclamoured for the head of the hated favourite. The Emperor, fearful\r\nfor his own life, at the instance of the women of his court demanded\r\nthat the head of Cleander should be thrown from the palace to the\r\npeople. The spectacle of this bloody expiation appeased the fury of\r\nthe rabble. On the advice of his physicians[103] Commodus himself beat\r\na hasty retreat to Laurentum, to seek an antidote in the scent of its\r\nabundant laurels. Those who remained in Rome filled their noses and\r\nears with sweet ointments, to neutralize the pestilential exhalations\r\nfrom infected bodies and from the contagious atmosphere. At last a\r\nRoman emperor is found, in presence of pestilence, consulting—not the\r\nSibylline books, not the oracle, not the omens—but a physician, and\r\nobeying his instruction. Medicine has tardily come into her own, and\r\nPliny’s sarcasm, that Rome prospered for 600 years without physicians,\r\nhas lost its sting. But we shall see presently that the hour for\r\nprofessional exaltation is not yet.\r\n\r\nThe great Antonine plague—the long plague, as Galen calls it, for\r\nit lasted no less than fifteen years[104]—was brought to Rome from\r\nthe East by the Syrian army of Verus, about A.D. 165. Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus[105] sets its commencement in the sacrilegious folly of\r\nsome Roman soldiers at the sack of the city of Seleucia. These men\r\nwrenched from its site a statue of Apollo, and from a narrow aperture\r\nbeneath its pedestal the pestilence escaped, carrying death wherever\r\nit went. Julius Capitolinus (_c._ A.D. 300) confirms the statement of\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus, except in that he traces the source of origin to\r\na small golden coffer in this same temple of Apollo. Carried thence by\r\nthe victorious army to Rome, it found there conditions favourable to\r\nits propagation in an already existing famine, in the accumulation of\r\nthe soldiery, and in the concourse of spectators, who had come to see\r\nthe triumph of the joint emperors duly celebrated. Of the mortality\r\nat Rome no figures exist, but it is said to have been very great.\r\nDead bodies were so numerous, that they were carried to burial heaped\r\nup in carts. Aurelius[106] paid the dead the tribute of a public\r\nfuneral, and erected statues to the memory of many men of high estate.\r\nHis philosophy, though proof against religious belief, showed itself\r\nnot proof against religious superstition. The whole pagan ritual of\r\nexpiation was paraded on behalf of the distracted city. The neglected\r\nworship of the gods was revived with renewed vigour, and the aid of\r\nthose most powerful to help in such circumstances was eagerly invoked.\r\nA lustration was solemnly performed for the purification of the city,\r\nand a _lectisternium_ celebrated for seven whole days. The people were\r\nreadily infected with the contagion of their sovereign’s superstition,\r\nand from this time may be dated a brief revival of the worship of the\r\neffete pagan deities. Aurelius sought even to appease the anger of the\r\nnational gods by a persecution of the Christians, whose religion was\r\nan insult to their majesty. The Christian chronicler, Orosius,[107]\r\nattributes the pestilence actually to the persecution of the Christians\r\nthat had broken out in Asia and Gaul before its commencement. All that\r\nis known for certain is, that such a persecution was a consequence, if\r\nnot a cause as well. An engraved blood-coloured jasper, preserved in\r\nParis, and figured in the _Histoire de l’Académie des Inscriptions et\r\nBelles-Lettres_, survives to commemorate the sacrifices by which Marcus\r\nAurelius sought to charm away the plague. Duruy[108] describes its\r\nfeatures:\r\n\r\n       ‘Marcus Aurelius as sovereign pontiff: on his veiled\r\n    head a globe, symbol of his sovereign power: behind\r\n    him an augur’s staff: facing the Emperor Rome helmeted\r\n    and Aesculapius with horns: under Aurelius, Hygieia or\r\n    Health: lastly the head of Faustina. The Sagittarius,\r\n    who occupies the centre, marks the time of the\r\n    sacrifices, offered in November or December.’\r\n\r\nSome have inferred from a passage of Julius Capitolinus that Marcus\r\nAurelius himself died of this pestilence in A.D. 180. In describing his\r\ndeath-bed, Capitolinus says that he took a hasty farewell of his son,\r\nfor fear of communicating his malady to him.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr considers that the ancient world never recovered from the havoc\r\nof this pestilence. To it he traces the decadence of Roman literature\r\nand art in the years that followed, and points to analogous results\r\nin Greece from the plague of Athens, and in early German and early\r\nFlorentine literature from the Black Death of A.D. 1348. But the seeds\r\nof decay in the empire of Rome had already been sown, as they had been\r\nin the empire of Athens before the Peloponnesian War. Pericles himself\r\nhad warned the Athenians at the outset of the far-reaching consequences\r\nof failure. We shall see too hereafter that in the case of the early\r\nFlorentine literature other more potent influences than pestilence were\r\nconcerned in its temporary effacement. The lesson to be learnt from a\r\ncomprehensive survey of the history of pestilence would seem rather to\r\nbe this, that with the community, as with the individual, the sound\r\nconstitution throws off the effects of a sickness that strikes right\r\nhome, when the resisting power is impaired. Such was assuredly the\r\ncase with the interminable sequence of plagues that assailed Rome in\r\nadolescence as well as in adult life. But as decadence and decrepitude\r\nbeset the body politic, the wounds of pestilence went deeper and left\r\nabiding scars.\r\n\r\nThe Antonine plague bequeathed one ill-starred legacy to the profession\r\nof medicine. Every sovereign has the physicians he deserves, and Galen\r\nwas physician to Marcus Aurelius. At the first onset of the pestilence\r\nGalen made off to Campania, and finding no safety there took ship\r\nto Pergamus. Thence, after two years’ absence, he returned at the\r\nsummons of the emperors, and after a brief stay in Rome joined them at\r\nAquileia, where pestilence tracked him down again.\r\n\r\n    Cowards die many times before their death.\r\n\r\nCourage, however, and medical acumen are by no means constant\r\ncompanions, and for many centuries, in face of pestilence, physicians,\r\nand among them Morgagni and Sydenham, were doomed to follow the example\r\nof Galen as faithfully as they cherished his precepts.\r\n\r\nGalen has been regarded generally as the leading authority on the\r\nmedical aspects of the Antonine plague, but the value of Galen’s\r\ntestimony is not enhanced by the investigation of these attendant\r\ncircumstances. The physician who takes flight at the outset is little\r\nlikely subsequently to observe the disease carefully, constantly,\r\nand at close quarters: nor is it surprising to find that much of\r\nhis symptomatology is borrowed directly either from Thucydides or\r\nHippocrates. The striking picture of Thucydides must needs dominate\r\nthe mind of the man who studies medicine in his arm-chair, so that\r\nwe are prepared to find Galen asserting the identity of the Antonine\r\npestilence with the plague of Athens. Here and there passages are\r\nlifted almost _verbatim_ from Thucydides. For example, Galen[109] says\r\nthat the sick man’s body did not seem hotter than normal to the touch,\r\nbut that he suffered an intolerable inward burning. The skin was not\r\nyellow, but reddish and livid. The transference of οὔτε χλωρόν from\r\nThucydides shows that he is copying Thucydides, and is not describing\r\nwhat he himself saw. Again, the description of the eruption, though\r\nfar more precise and complete than that by Thucydides, shows his\r\ninfluence closely, and now and again falls into his actual words, as\r\nin ἐξήνθησεν ἕλκεσιν ὅλον τὸ σῶμα. The same also is true of the more\r\ngeneral symptoms[110] of the disease, such as the insistence on the\r\ncharacteristic appearance of the inflamed eyes, and the redness of\r\nmouth, tongue, and fauces.\r\n\r\nThere is the ring of the charlatan, too, in Galen’s use and advocacy of\r\nArmenian bole as an antipestilential specific, in striking contrast to\r\nthe crude disavowal of all remedies by Thucydides. Galen[111] says that\r\n‘all those who used it were promptly cured’—one wonders at Galen’s\r\nflight—‘those who felt no effect from it died: no other remedy could\r\nreplace it’—and then he sublimely concludes, ‘that those, with whom\r\nthe remedy failed, were incurable.’ This Armenian bole was merely an\r\nargillaceous earth brought from Persia and Armenia, which owed its red\r\ncolour to oxide of iron. Galen used it as an astringent for wounds and\r\nulcers before he vaunted it as a specific for pestilence. Internally,\r\nat any rate, it must have been almost inert in medicinal doses, and as\r\nGalen adduces no evidence in support of his crude dictum, we need be at\r\nno pains to justify our incredulity.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that the Antonine plague was not one and\r\nthe same disease throughout its course. Had it been so, we should\r\nhave expected from Galen something in the nature of a single clinical\r\npicture, rather than casual references scattered throughout his\r\nvoluminous writings.\r\n\r\nIn describing the character of the eruption and its transformations,\r\nGalen[112] certainly seems to have small-pox in mind. At a certain\r\nstage the eruption broke out all over the body in the form of\r\nἐξανθήματα μέλανα (a dark efflorescence), probably of haemorrhagic\r\ntype. When it ulcerated, a crust (ἐφελκίς) formed on the surface,\r\nwhich became detached, and then everything proceeded to a cure. A\r\nscar remained after the separation of the crust, comparable to the\r\n‘pitting’ of small-pox. In some cases ulceration did not occur, but\r\nthe exanthem was rough and scaly and became detached like a skin: in\r\nthis condition all got well. Galen gives some indication of the course\r\nof the disease in one who recovered. ‘A young man on the ninth day had\r\nhis whole body covered with ulcers, as had most of those who recovered.\r\nThen he was seized with a cough, and three days after the ninth he\r\nwas in a condition to go into the country for convalescence.’ The day\r\nafter the cough set in, he expelled during a paroxysm of coughing a\r\ncrust just like those of the cutaneous ulcers. Galen had previously\r\nexamined his mouth and fauces, and had detected no signs of ulceration.\r\nHe could also swallow both liquids and solids without any difficulty.\r\nTo determine whether the crust came from his gullet or no, Galen\r\nadministered a draught of vinegar and mustard; and from the absence of\r\npain attending this drastic procedure he concluded that it must have\r\ncome from the larynx and not from the gullet. Destructive ulcerations\r\nof the larynx have been recorded in rare instances in the course of\r\nsmall-pox, but such a condition would certainly preclude a journey to\r\nthe country after the lapse of two days. It would be less impossible\r\nafter the expulsion of a diphtheritic membrane.\r\n\r\nIt would be unprofitable to follow Galen further into the features of\r\nthe pestilential fever he details, for, as we have said, it is quite\r\nuncertain that these are the features of a single disease. Indeed,\r\napart from the evidence of Galen’s writings, it would be reasonable to\r\npresume the reverse from such knowledge as we have of other prolonged\r\nperiods of pestilence.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Galen we may say that he postulates a dual causation\r\nof pestilence: on the one hand, great irregularity of the seasons\r\ninducing a pestilential state of the atmosphere: on the other, a\r\nvitiated condition of the human body, due to contaminated food,\r\nrendering it liable to fever from very slight causes. The atmospheric\r\nfactor, no doubt, would seem to be confirmed by the universality of\r\nthe disease, while the greater severity of the disease and perhaps its\r\nspecial incidence as well among the ill-fed and destitute would seem to\r\nincriminate the resisting power of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe plague of A.D. 252, during the joint imperialty of Gallus and\r\nHostilian, rivalled the Antonine pestilence both in virulence and\r\nduration. Hostilian was one of the first victims, though his death was\r\ncommonly ascribed to the hand of Gallus. Eusebius[113] says that the\r\ndisease had already worked havoc in Alexandria and Egypt, before it\r\nreached Rome. In some cities of Rome and Greece the daily mortality\r\nrose as high as 5,000,[114] and with greater or less virulence the\r\ndisease spread over the whole known world.[115] Eusebius attributes the\r\npestilence to moulds deposited from the air, a belief that we shall\r\nmeet again in the course of the Great Plague of London.\r\n\r\nCyprian, the Christian bishop of Carthage, has left us some details\r\nof the symptoms in his eloquent homily ‘De Mortalitate’, which St.\r\nAugustine admired so greatly. Eusebius and Cyprian are both intent on\r\nextolling the self-sacrificing zeal with which the Christians laid\r\ndown their lives in the service of the sick. Their writings help us to\r\nappreciate the contempt of suffering generated in the mind of the early\r\nenthusiasts of Christianity by living perpetually in the presence of\r\npersecution and in the fear of death. We know from the manner in which\r\nCyprian[116] yielded himself to the sword of the executioner that the\r\nspirit of the ‘Sermo de Mortalitate’ permeated his whole being. In this\r\nsermon we may still read the glowing appeal of Cyprian to his hearers\r\nto seek courage and consolation in repentance for their sins.\r\n\r\nCedrenus[117] was so impressed with the infectiveness of the disease\r\nthat he believed it might be communicated by a look, as Plato had\r\nconceived to be true of ophthalmia. Trebellius Pollio[118] recounts the\r\nassociation of terrestrial and other portents. Volcanoes awoke to fresh\r\nactivity: earthquakes occurred and rumblings of the earth were heard:\r\nthe sky was darkened for days: chasms yawned in the ground: great tidal\r\nwaves overwhelmed many cities. It seemed as though the end of the\r\nworld, foretold by the Christians, was at hand. In Rome the Sibylline\r\nbooks were consulted, and they prescribed the easy atonement of a\r\nsacrifice to Jupiter Salutaris.\r\n\r\nEusebius[119] is the chief authority for the pestilence of A.D. 302,\r\nduring the reign of Maximian. It was accompanied by famine, so that the\r\npeople were reduced to eating grass, and as many died of starvation\r\nas of disease. The famished dogs fought over the corpses of the dead,\r\nand the people slaughtered them wholesale, lest they should go mad and\r\nattack the living.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] _De Re Rustica_, i. 12.\r\n\r\n[93] _Metamorphoses_, vii. 520 seq.\r\n\r\n[94] Bk.

It would seem to be necessary to revise this opinion in the\r\nface of a fragment of the writings of Rufus of Ephesus, preserved by\r\nOribasius,[120] the Christian physician of the Emperor Julian (A.D.\r\n355-63). He writes: ‘The buboes called pestilential are most fatal and\r\nacute, especially those that are seen occurring about Libya, Egypt,\r\nand Syria, and which are mentioned by Dionysius Curtus. Dioscorides\r\nand Posidonius make much mention of them in the plague, which occurred\r\nin their time in Libya: they say it was accompanied by acute fever,\r\npain, and prostration of the whole body, delirium, and _the appearance\r\nof large and hard buboes_, which did not suppurate, not only in the\r\naccustomed parts, but also in the groins and armpits:’ and further:\r\n‘One can foresee an approaching plague by paying attention to the ill\r\ncondition of the seasons, to the mode of living less conducive to\r\nhealth, and to the death of animals that precedes its invasion.’\r\n\r\nRufus is believed to have flourished in the reign of Trajan (A.D.\r\n98-117), and may have been his physician. Dioscorides and Posidonius\r\nwere probably Alexandrine physicians who flourished soon after the\r\nChristian era. The identity of Dionysius Curtus is conjectural, but\r\nthere is some reason to think that he practised medicine in Alexandria\r\nin the third century B.C. Accepting these dates, one must admit that\r\nthe evidence for the existence of bubonic plague in epidemic form in\r\nnorthern Africa and the Levant as early as the third century B.C.\r\nis exceedingly strong. Even if we conceive buboes to have been more\r\ncommon than nowadays in the course of other acute infectious diseases,\r\nthe above record can hardly denote anything but bubonic plague. The\r\nreference to buboes as occurring with greater frequency in other parts\r\nthan the groins and armpits does not appear to have received from\r\nmedical writers the attention it deserves.\r\n\r\nWe have already adduced evidence to show that Hippocrates also was\r\nfamiliar with bubonic plague in its sporadic, but probably not in its\r\nepidemic form. Galen,[121] too, discusses the relation of buboes to\r\nfever in such a manner as to show that he also was acquainted with a\r\nsevere bubonic malady, distinct from ordinary septic buboes. Oribasius\r\nalso is cognizant of bubonic fevers, but it may be asserted generally\r\nthat neither Galen nor Oribasius shows any signs of knowing them as\r\na prevalent epidemic pestilence. We may, then, justly say that the\r\nnarrative of Procopius affords the first unequivocal description of an\r\nepidemic of bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nAccording to Procopius[122] the plague began at the ill-starred\r\nPelusium, spreading in one direction through Alexandria and Egypt, in\r\nanother through Palestine, and thence throughout the world, which would\r\nhave meant to him from the eastern limits of Persia as far westward\r\nas the shores of the Atlantic. In the light of modern knowledge it\r\nis probable that Pelusium was no more than a distributing centre\r\n_en route_, and that the true focus of origin lay much further back\r\nalong the commercial highways to the east or south. Of its pandemic\r\ncharacter, however, we have the fullest confirmation in a succession\r\nof historical records. Evagrius[123] says that its total duration was\r\nfifty-two years, and this also it is possible to substantiate from the\r\nannexed table of its offsets, along with the names of the authorities\r\nfor each locality.\r\n\r\n    _Date._      _Locality._      _Authority._\r\n\r\n    A.D. 540       Antioch          Evagrius.\r\n    A.D. 542       Byzantium        Procopius.\r\n    A.D. 549       Arles            Gregory of Tours.\r\n    A.D. 558       Byzantium        Agathias.\r\n    A.D. 565       Liguria          Paul the Deacon.\r\n    A.D. 567       Auvergne         Gregory of Tours.\r\n                   Narbonne         Gregory of Tours.\r\n    A.D. 587       Marseilles       Gregory of Tours.\r\n    A.D. 590       Rome             Gregory of Tours.\r\n                                    Paul the Deacon.\r\n                                    John the Deacon.\r\n    A.D. 590       Avignon          Gregory of Tours.\r\n    A.D. 591       Strasbourg       Oseas Schadaeus.\r\n\r\nProcopius describes the plague as progressing by definite stages,\r\nexpending its virulence on one country before passing to another, as\r\nthough intent on overlooking nothing. Indeed, if at first it touched\r\na place lightly, it always returned to it subsequently, till the full\r\nmeasure of punishment was exacted. Always beginning at the sea-coast\r\nit spread into the interior, so that the infection in the first place\r\nwas clearly sea-borne. He states that it took over a year to reach\r\nByzantium, where it made its appearance in the spring of A.D. 542. We\r\nknow, however, from Evagrius that plague was already in Antioch in A.D.\r\n540, earlier, therefore, than the date of its alleged appearance in\r\nPelusium.\r\n\r\nIn his discussion of etiology Procopius borrows much of the phraseology\r\nof Thucydides, but neither here nor elsewhere does he show the least\r\nsign of being influenced by the substance of the Thucydidean narrative.\r\nThucydides, it will be remembered, evidently attributed the plague of\r\nAthens to natural causes, declining to speculate as to what could have\r\nproduced such a disturbance of nature (μεταβολή).\r\n\r\nProcopius says that those who pretended to knowledge ascribed the\r\npestilence to things darting down from heaven (τοῖς ἐξ οὐρανοῦ\r\nἐπισκήπτουσιν). This is indeed harking back to primitive conceptions.\r\nBut he adds that they do so without a fragment of evidence, merely\r\nfor the sake of deceiving, ascribing to nature what is clearly the\r\nhandiwork of God and nothing else. This opinion he bases on the ground\r\nthat the plague did not confine its ravages to any single country nor\r\nfall specially on either sex or any age, but spread over the whole\r\nworld, regardless of season and of differences of habit. The argument,\r\nin so far as it was negative, was certainly a strong one in the light\r\nof the medical knowledge of his time, which referred much of the\r\ndistinction of different maladies to variations of climate, soil,\r\nseason, habit, and other accidental circumstances. Visual and auditory\r\nhallucinations were not lacking. Procopius says that many that were\r\nstricken by the plague saw, either when awake or when asleep, visions\r\nof spirits arrayed in human forms. Some seemed to hear in their sleep\r\na voice saying that they were enrolled in the number of the dead. They\r\nfancied that these spectres in human form struck them in some part of\r\nthe body, and immediately they were seized with the disease. To avoid\r\nthese demons some shut themselves up in their houses and would not come\r\nout on any account. Others tried to escape the demons by invoking that\r\nthe most sacred names and by every form of expiation.\r\n\r\nThis idea of pestilential demons seems to be of oriental origin. We\r\nhave already encountered it in the story of Apollonius of Tyana at\r\nEphesus. It figures in early Indian medicine, and also in Mahometan\r\nlore. Mahomet seems to have adopted it directly from Magian tradition,\r\nas embodied by Zoroaster in the Zendavesta. The Magians conceived\r\none supreme God and Creator of the universe, from whom also emanated\r\ntwo active principles, personified as Ormusd, the principle or angel\r\nof light or good, and Ahriman, the principle or angel of darkness or\r\nevil, a demon. From these two opposite principles the universe was\r\ncompounded, and in the direction of its affairs these two conflicting\r\nelements were always striving for mastery. So long as the angel of\r\nlight was in the ascendant it was well with the affairs of men; but if\r\nfor a while the demon of darkness prevailed, then sorrow and suffering\r\nand sin were the lot of mortal man. It was inevitable that a shepherd\r\nrace, tending their flocks beneath a star-lit sky in the plains of\r\nArabia and the uplands of Central Asia should see in the light and\r\nthe darkness two hostile personalities dominating their existence for\r\nbetter or for worse.\r\n\r\nMahometans believed that spirits were sent by God armed with bows and\r\narrows to disseminate plague as a punishment for sin. Spectres of a\r\nblack colour dealt fatal wounds, but those dealt by white spectres were\r\nnot fatal. We shall presently find this same fancy figuring in the\r\nliterature and art of mediaeval Italy. It is not without interest to\r\nhave traced the conception spreading, like the plague itself, from an\r\nendemic focus in the East, first to Byzantium, and then by slow stages\r\nto Italy and the West.\r\n\r\nIn Byzantium many succumbed to the disease without any premonitory\r\nvisions. In these there was a sudden onset of a mild fever without any\r\ngrave symptoms, so that the victim had no apprehension of dying. Then\r\neither the same day, or a day or two after, appeared a bubo (βουβών),\r\neither in the groin or armpit, or behind the ear, or elsewhere. So\r\nfar as these symptoms went, all suffered in pretty much the same way.\r\nThe Byzantine plague was therefore characteristically bubonic, and\r\nthe buboes seem to have been distributed in the different parts of\r\nthe body, much as we find them to-day. In this and in all essential\r\npoints bubonic plague still exhibits a striking conformity to the\r\npicture drawn by Procopius some 1,400 years ago. Indeed Procopius\r\nhas afforded an admirable outline sketch of oriental plague, to\r\nwhich the most recent medical science has added little beyond some\r\nelaboration of detail. We can decipher in his narrative at least\r\nfour recognized types—the bubonic, the pustular, the pneumonic, and\r\nthe tonsillar—as having prevailed during this epidemic in Byzantium.\r\nUnlike Thucydides, Procopius rejects the idea of contagion, as opposed\r\nto his own observations. Physicians, nurses, and those who buried the\r\ndead were not, in his experience, specially affected, in spite of their\r\nconstant contact with the sick; and contrariwise, many contracted the\r\ndisease without any contact at all. The belief of Procopius in the\r\npestilence as a special act of God almost necessitated his being a\r\nnon-contagionist. He was at a loss whether to attribute the varied\r\nmanifestations of the disease to differences of constitution, or to\r\nthe will of the Author of the plague. In one case profound lethargy\r\nprevailed, in another maniacal delirium. The lethargic lay simply\r\nregardless of everything and died of starvation, unless food was\r\npressed on them. The delirious in their terror tried to flee: they\r\nstruggled with their attendants in the attempt to throw themselves out\r\nof windows, or to drown themselves. Their desire was not to assuage\r\ntheir thirst, for often they threw themselves into the sea. This is\r\nevidently a criticism of the suggestion of Thucydides that it was\r\nthirst that drove the victims to throw themselves into cisterns.\r\n\r\nProcopius says that the physicians conceived that the source of the\r\ndisease lay in the buboes. This was a not unnatural inference from the\r\nfact that, in cases of simple suppuration of the bubo, the sufferer\r\nusually recovered, as though some virulent humour had escaped by this\r\nchannel. For the same reason in later years incision was performed,\r\nand suppuration encouraged, whenever practicable. When, however, the\r\nphysicians opened the buboes in the hope of discovering the cause, they\r\nfound nothing but a horrible growth, like a carbuncle (ἄνθραξ). The\r\nByzantine physicians evidently regarded the disease as a morbid process\r\nwithin the confines of recognized pathology.\r\n\r\nThere was a pustular type of the disease, and those who got a crop of\r\nblack pustules all over the body, as large as a lentil, died at once.\r\nProcopius in his φλυκταίναις μελαίναις, ὅσον φακοῦ μέγεθος, ἐξήνθει\r\nτὸ σῶμα echoes the language of Thucydides, ᾄφλυκταίναις μικραῖς καὶ\r\nἓλκεσιν ἐξηνθηκός: and it is noteworthy that ulcers were no feature of\r\nthe Byzantine plague.\r\n\r\nMany dropped dead from spontaneous vomiting of blood, probably from the\r\nlungs, as is not infrequent in the pneumonic form of plague.\r\n\r\nSome escaped with a defect in the speech, so that as long as they lived\r\nthey stammered or stuttered, and were unintelligible. This may well\r\nhave been a sequel of the tonsillar type.\r\n\r\nThe plague lasted in epidemic virulence in Byzantium for four months in\r\nall, and was at its height for three. This again, speaking broadly, has\r\nbeen a feature of most European and Levantine outbreaks. At the worst\r\nthe daily mortality reached the appalling total of ten thousand.\r\n\r\nProcopius dwells at length on the accumulation of dead bodies in the\r\nstreets and the neglect of funeral rites. At first each man buried the\r\ndead members of his own household, sometimes throwing them into graves\r\nprepared for others; but soon buriers failed, and then corpses began to\r\nlitter the streets. These Justinian commissioned his agent Theodorus\r\nto bury. When all the existing burial-grounds were filled, huge\r\nburial-pits were dug wherever they could find space all round the city.\r\nFinally, when the digging of graves could no longer keep pace with the\r\ndeaths, they mounted the towers of the city walls in Sycae, the port of\r\nByzantium, and removing the roofs threw in the bodies promiscuously:\r\nwhen these were filled, the roofs were replaced. But when the wind\r\nset from that quarter, the awful stench proved most distressing to\r\nthe citizens. Many corpses were simply cast out on the shore, where\r\nthey were piled in barges and turned adrift out to sea. We shall see\r\nthese various conditions strikingly reproduced during the plague of\r\nMarseilles in A.D. 1721. John of Ephesus states that the ambulance\r\narrangements made by Justinian for the burial of the dead met all the\r\nrequirements, but it is impossible to accept his statement in face of\r\nthe precise and detailed account of Procopius.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the plague, according to Procopius, turned men from\r\ndissoluteness to piety, for fear that their own death was imminent. If,\r\nhowever, they fell sick and recovered, they became even more dissolute\r\nthan before, in the belief that they were now safe for the future.\r\nAccording to Thucydides, the Athenian Greeks became reckless from the\r\nfirst and gave themselves over to pleasure, seeing that the disease\r\nsmote virtuous and vicious alike. Perhaps, however, the difference\r\nlay more in the mental attitude of the observer than in the actual\r\ndemeanour of those observed.\r\n\r\nAll work came to a standstill in Byzantium, so that famine supervened\r\nin the city, where usually everything was in profusion. Justinian\r\nhimself became infected and suffered from an attack, in which a bubo\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief is the account that Procopius gives of the plague of\r\nByzantium, as he saw it with his own eyes. Unquestionably he had\r\nbefore him the description of the plague of Athens, for now and again\r\nhe slips into an identical turn of language. But to speak of him as a\r\nflagrant plagiarist of Thucydides is sheer absurdity. Rather he gives\r\nthe impression of maintaining a critical attitude towards Thucydides,\r\nand of emphasizing the points of dissent. Procopius has no doubt that\r\nhe is describing the same disease as Thucydides, and is impressed by\r\nthe clinical differences he has observed. The tone of Thucydides is\r\nsubjective: he attempts a general description, but cannot keep in\r\nthe background the symptoms of his own case. The tone of Procopius\r\nis wholly objective: he writes as an intensely interested onlooker,\r\nretailing his own observations, supplemented by the statements of those\r\nwho have had the disease and recovered. The apparent resemblance of the\r\ntwo accounts is really no more than surface deep.\r\n\r\nAn account of an offset of this pandemic at Antioch survives from the\r\npen of the historian Evagrius,[124] who was born in A.D. 536 and spent\r\nthe greater part of his life at Antioch. Apparently he knew nothing of\r\nthe records of Procopius or Agathias, for he says that the history of\r\nthis pestilence had not been written previously. He knew the narrative\r\nof the plague of Athens, for he says that this plague was ‘in some\r\nrespects much like that which Thucydides described, in others quite\r\nunlike’: it cannot be said to have influenced either the form or the\r\nsubstance of his description. He says that it first reached Antioch\r\nin 540 B.C., whereas it did not appear at Byzantium till the spring\r\nof 542 B.C., and that the pandemic lasted altogether fifty-two years,\r\nexceeding ‘all the diseases that had ever been before Philostratus\r\nwondered at the plague, which was in his time, because it continued\r\nfifteen years’. This is presumed to have been the Antonine pestilence,\r\nfor Philostratus was born in Lemnos about A.D. 170, but spent most of\r\nhis life in Rome and died there in A.D. 245. Evagrius had the fullest\r\nopportunities of observing the plague at close quarters, for as a boy\r\nat school he himself suffered from an inguinal bubo, and in later years\r\nhe lost his wife and several children of plague. He was but three\r\nyears old when it first reached Antioch, so that his description must\r\nrepresent the disease after it had been rife for many years. Evagrius\r\ntraces its origin further back than does Procopius, placing it in\r\nEthiopia, so that it may actually have originated in an endemic area\r\nin Central Africa. Spreading over the whole world, it attacked cities\r\nquite irrespective of season, summer and winter alike. Evagrius has no\r\ndoubt whatever of the contagiousness of the distemper. Those, he says,\r\nwho escaped one year were attacked the next, and those who fled to\r\nplaces free from disease were the first to succumb, as they carried the\r\ncontagion with them. Infection seemed to be taken in various ways—by\r\nsharing beds, by actual contact, by visiting infected houses, or even\r\nby casual meeting in the market-place. Some, however, escaped in spite\r\nof running every risk of infection.\r\n\r\nThe description that Evagrius gives of the symptoms of the disease,\r\nthough brief, is wonderfully comprehensive. It shows that he was\r\ncognizant of the tonsillar, the bubonic, and the carbuncular or\r\npustular types at least, and the rapidity of a fatal issue in a\r\nproportion of the cases suggests that pneumonic and septicaemic forms\r\nwere also rife. ‘The disease’, he writes, ‘was compound and mixt with\r\nmany other maladies. It took some men first in the head, made their\r\neyes as red as blood and puffed up their cheeks: afterwards it fell at\r\ntheir throat, and whomsoever it took it dispatched him out of the way.\r\nIt began with some with a fire and voiding of all that was within them,\r\nin others with swellings about the secret parts of the body, and there\r\narose burning fires, so that they died thereof within two or three days\r\nof the furthest in such sort and of so perfect a remembrance as if they\r\nhad not been sick at all; others died mad, and carbuncles that arose\r\nout of the flesh killed many.’\r\n\r\nAgathias[125] (b. A.D. 536) describes a recrudescence of this pandemic\r\nin Byzantium in A.D. 558. He carried on the history of Procopius from\r\nits termination to A.D. 558. He says that the disease had never really\r\ndisappeared since the first outbreak in A.D. 542, when it burst out\r\nfuriously a second time in the spring of this year. Many persons fell\r\nas though stricken with apoplexy: those who held out longest died\r\non the fifth day. Buboes and continuous fever were the outstanding\r\nfeatures, as in the previous visitation. ‘People of all ages perished\r\nindiscriminately, but especially the young and vigorous and those in\r\nthe flower of youth: and of them the males, for the females were not\r\nso much affected.’ With an epidemic recurrence such as this, the chief\r\nincidence would necessarily be on the young, who had neither resisted,\r\nnor acquired immunity from, a previous attack. The character of their\r\noccupation or of their habits of life would doubtless explain the\r\nspecial liability of the males to infection.\r\n\r\nGregory of Tours[126] (A.D. 540-94) testifies to the widespread\r\ncharacter of the plague in France. In A.D. 549 he says that it\r\ndepopulated the province of Arles, and afterwards devastated Narbonne.\r\nHere Felix, bishop of Nantes,[127] succumbed to the sloughing of his\r\nlegs caused by the application of cantharides plasters to a crop of\r\npustules.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 566, before the plague invaded the Auvergne,[128] a succession\r\nof portents terrified the district. Three or four great brilliant\r\nlights made their appearance around the sun, which nevertheless\r\nunderwent almost complete eclipse in October, looking dark and\r\ndiscoloured and like a bag. The heaven also seemed to be on fire, and\r\nmany strange signs were seen. Then in A.D. 567 the epidemic raged\r\nthroughout the district, causing an immense mortality. Lyons, Bourges,\r\nChalons, and Dijon also lost a large part of their population. Coffins\r\nfor the dead soon failed, and as many as ten bodies would be placed\r\nin the same grave. One Sunday no less than three hundred corpses were\r\ncounted in the church of St. Peter at Clermont. Death seized the\r\nvictims with dramatic suddenness. ‘There grew in the groin or armpit\r\na lesion in the shape of a serpent, the effect of which was such that\r\nmen yielded up their souls on the second or third day, and its violence\r\ncompletely took away their senses.’\r\n\r\nIn this epidemic buboes were evidently most frequently found in\r\nthe groins, for Gregory repeatedly speaks of the disease as _lues\r\ninguinaria_ or _morbus inguinalis_ and the like.\r\n\r\nPlague broke out at Marseilles[129] in A.D. 587, brought there by\r\na merchant ship from Spain, which concealed its contact with a\r\nplague-stricken port. Several people made purchases from it, and in\r\nconsequence eight inhabitants of one house were fatally infected. As in\r\nthe epidemic of A.D. 1720, the disease did not spread immediately to\r\nthe whole town. Bishop Theodore and a few of his suite shut themselves\r\nup in the church of St. Victor, and there, amid the general desolation,\r\nimplored the mercy of God with prayer and vigil till the epidemic was\r\nat an end. On the return of the fugitive populace a belated outbreak\r\nexacted its appointed tribute.\r\n\r\nAround Avignon[130] celestial portents foretold the plague that broke\r\nout in A.D. 590. The earth was illuminated at night by a light as\r\nbright as the midday. Balls of fire were seen tracking the sky during\r\nthe night. A violent earthquake was felt at dawn in mid-June. The\r\nsun suffered almost complete eclipse in mid-August. Abundant autumn\r\nthunderstorms and rain raised the rivers in flood.\r\n\r\nMeantime Italy, too, had been in like case. Paul the Deacon[131] (A.D.\r\n720-90) briefly refers to a plague that had devastated Liguria in A.D.\r\n565. He says that the plague was presaged by the sudden appearance of\r\nmarks on houses, doors, utensils, and clothing, and the more they tried\r\nto efface them the more conspicuous they became. Eusebius[132] in like\r\nmanner told of moulds on the walls of houses in a previous pestilence,\r\nand in Leviticus[133] we read of greenish and reddish marks on houses\r\ninfected with leprosy. Towards the end of the year buboes began to\r\nattack the people, followed by a fever that killed in three days. The\r\ninhabitants fled, leaving property and cattle and crops, and desolation\r\nreigned supreme.\r\n\r\nBut it was on the head of hapless Rome that the full fury of the\r\nexpiring storm was destined to spend its virulence. Both Gregory of\r\nTours[134] and Paul the Deacon have left a record of the havoc. Gregory\r\nsays that he obtained his information from his own deacon, who happened\r\nto be in Rome at the time. Paul the Deacon[135] seems to borrow his\r\nmaterial from Gregory of Tours. An inundation of the Tiber in A.D. 589\r\nresulted in the destruction of many old buildings on its banks and in\r\nthe flooding of the granaries of the church, so that immense stores of\r\ngrain were spoilt. The river yielded up a multitude of serpents, and\r\na dragon of extraordinary size was seen to float through the city on\r\nits passage to the sea. Probably these were eels from the muddy bed\r\nof the Tiber, metamorphosed after the manner of Ovid into serpents:\r\nthe dragon no one seems to have seen at close quarters. The inundation\r\nwas followed in A.D. 590 by a severe outburst of bubonic plague\r\n(_pestilentia, quam inguinariam vocant_).\r\n\r\nPortents were not confined to Rome. According to Evagrius,[136] a great\r\nearthquake in A.D. 589 laid Antioch in ruins, destroying the sanctuary\r\nof the Mother of God, and taking sixty thousand lives. In Upper Italy\r\nalso there were extensive inundations due to overflowing of the\r\nmountain streams in Venetia, Liguria, and the sub-Alpine plains.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to contrast the records of these chroniclers of the\r\nChurch of the West with those of Procopius and Evagrius, and still more\r\nso with that of the pagan historian Thucydides. So intent are they on\r\nthe mental and moral features of the distemper, that they say almost\r\nnothing of its physical features. They dilate at length on the visions\r\nand hallucinations that haunted the distracted fancy of the sufferers,\r\nwhich Thucydides disregards, though such must have accompanied the\r\nwild delirium he describes. Demons stalking the streets, ineffaceable\r\nmarks and moulds on houses, voices from the grave, and celestial\r\nportents were the creations of the delirious fancy, and are faithfully\r\nreproduced in the pages of the Christian writers. One is sensible\r\nof something of the spirit in which Fra Angelico portrayed the joys\r\nof heaven and the torments of hell, when pestilence lay heavy on\r\nmediaeval Italy. The mortality in Rome was appalling. Death was rampant\r\neverywhere. At first the dead bodies were gathered up and flung in\r\nloads into great gaping graves, but after a while none were left even\r\nto bury the dead, and putrid corpses littered the streets. All business\r\nwas at a standstill, and such as survived were huddled, panic-stricken\r\nlike sheep, in the insecure sanctuary of the churches. To add to the\r\ngeneral consternation, Pope Pelagius perished on February 8, A.D. 590.\r\nThe choice of a successor lay with the clergy and people of Rome,\r\nsubject to confirmation by the Emperor. With one accord they haled\r\nAbbot Gregory from the seclusion of his monastery to the pontifical\r\nchair in anticipation of the Imperial assent. Gregory of Tours, Paul\r\nthe Deacon, and John the Deacon all tell of Gregory’s unwillingness\r\nto obey the summons, and of his attempt to intercept the letter of\r\nelection on its way to the Emperor in Constantinople. But meantime,\r\nas the plague showed no sign of abating, Gregory determined to try to\r\nappease the wrath of God by a special act of contrition. Ascending\r\nthe pulpit of St. John Lateran, he preached a memorable sermon, which\r\nhas been preserved by the hand of Gregory of Tours. He implored them\r\nto make their sufferings an instrument for their conversion, and a\r\nmeans by which to soften the hardness of their hearts. He besought\r\nthem, as Cyprian had done before, as Borromeo and Belsunce were to\r\ndo hereafter, not to let the suddenness with which death seized them,\r\nsweeping away numbers at a time, and giving no opportunity for tears of\r\npenitence, find them unprepared to meet their God. Let them call their\r\nsins to mind and purge them away with weeping, for God wills not the\r\ndeath of a sinner, but rather that he may turn from his wickedness and\r\nlive. Let no man despair because of the multitude of his offences. Did\r\nnot God forgive the people of Nineveh of old, when they did penance for\r\nthree days, and did He not give the reward of everlasting life to the\r\ndying thief? Let them therefore turn with him to God with importunity\r\nof prayer, or ever the sword of punishment descend. Does He not say by\r\nthe mouth of the Psalmist: call upon Me in the time of trouble: so will\r\nI hear thee and thou shalt praise Me. Let them all come with contrite\r\nhearts and mended moods at early dawn on the fourth day from then to\r\nthe celebration of a sevenfold litany, and with lamentation in their\r\nsouls, so that the stern Judge may remit the sentence of damnation He\r\nhas purposed to pass upon them. Let the clergy then start from the\r\nchurch of the martyr-saints Cosmo and Damian, along with the priests\r\nof the sixth region. All the abbots with their monks from the church\r\nof the martyrs Gervase and Protasius, along with the priests of the\r\nfourth region. All the abbesses with their flocks from the church of\r\nthe martyr-saints Marcellinus and Peter, along with the priests of the\r\nfirst region. All the children from the church of the martyr-saints\r\nJohn and Paul, along with the priests of the second region. All the\r\nlaity from the church of the protomartyr-saint Stephen, along with the\r\npriests of the seventh region. All the widowed women from the church\r\nof St. Euphemia, along with the priests of the fifth region. And the\r\nmarried women from the church of the martyr-saint Clement, along with\r\nthe priests of the third region. Let them all go forth from these\r\nseveral churches with prayer and lamentation, to meet at the basilica\r\nof the Blessed Virgin Mary the Mother of Christ, there with long and\r\nearnest supplication to implore pardon for their sins.\r\n\r\nSo Gregory distributed the remnant that the plague had spared according\r\nto the seven ecclesiastical regions of Rome, bidding his clergy spend\r\nthe three days’ interval in ceaseless psalms and prayers for mercy.\r\nThen on the fourth day, the festival of St. Mark, in the pale light\r\nof the early April morning, the great procession set out. With solemn\r\nchant of doleful _Miserere_, these seven trains of human suffering\r\nwended their slow way sadly amid the ruined monuments of ancient Rome.\r\nNo other sound broke the stillness, but the faint rustle of sweeping\r\ngarments and the silent shuffle of sick men’s feet. Now and again one\r\nfell stricken and lay as he fell, for Death was moving hither and\r\nthither among the moving ranks.[137] No less than eighty breathed out\r\ntheir lives before the church of the Mother of God was reached. There\r\nagain Gregory fervently exhorted the people to repentance, so that the\r\nplague might cease.\r\n\r\nA legend has it that as Gregory, heading his train of penitents,\r\nreached the Aelian Bridge, there, right before him, on the summit\r\nof Hadrian’s mole, a heavenly vision met his eyes. There stood the\r\nArchangel Michael, restoring a flaming sword to its sheath, in token\r\nthat the plague was stayed. It is to this legend that the mausoleum\r\nowes the name of Castel S. Angelo, that it has borne since the tenth\r\ncentury at least. A bronze figure of the Archangel sheathing his sword\r\nstill hovers on the summit, fifth of a series that have stood there at\r\ndifferent times.\r\n\r\nThe legend of the angel is not mentioned by either of Gregory’s\r\nbiographers, the deacons Paul and John, or by Bede or Gregory of Tours.\r\nThough of earlier origin than the tenth century, the first written\r\nrecords of it are in a German sermon of the twelfth or thirteenth\r\ncentury and in the _Legenda Aurea_ of the end of the thirteenth century\r\nCaxton has rendered it thus:\r\n\r\n       ‘And because the mortality ceased not, he ordained\r\n    a procession, in which he did do bear an image of our\r\n    Lady, which, as is said, St. Luke the Evangelist made,\r\n    which was a good painter, he had carved it and painted\r\n    it after the likeness of the glorious Virgin Mary. And\r\n    anon the mortality ceased, and the air became pure and\r\n    clear, and about the image was heard a voice of angels\r\n    that sung this Anthem:\r\n\r\n    Regina Coeli laetare! Alleluia.\r\n    Quia quem meruisti portare: Alleluia.\r\n    Resurrexit sicut dixit: Alleluia.\r\n\r\nand St. Gregory put thereto\r\n\r\n          Ora pro nobis, deum rogamus: Alleluia.\r\n\r\n       At the same time St. Gregory saw an angel upon a\r\n    castle, which made clean a sword all bloody, and put\r\n    it into the sheath, and thereby St. Gregory understood\r\n    that the pestilence of this mortality was passed, and\r\n    after that it was called the Castle Angel.’\r\n\r\nIn memory of this legend the great processions from S. Marco, until the\r\nprohibition of processions in A.D. 1870, used to strike up the antiphon\r\n‘Regina Coeli’, as soon as they came to the bridge of Hadrian.\r\n\r\nFor the true source of this legend there is no need to look beyond\r\nthe vision of the angel at the threshing-floor of Araunah: ‘And David\r\nlifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the Lord stand between the\r\nearth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out\r\nover Jerusalem.’ In the Capitoline Museum is an altar dedicated to Isis\r\nby some traveller on his safe return, and bearing the customary imprint\r\nof two feet. The devout believed these to be the footprints of the\r\nangel that appeared to Gregory, and the altar once stood in the church\r\nof Ara Coeli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREGORY AND THE ANGEL\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Giraudon, Paris]\r\n\r\nIt is certain that at least as early as this time pictures were carried\r\nin public procession. Theophylactus[138] has described two occasions\r\non which a sacred effigy of Christ, believed not to have been made\r\nby human hands, was carried into battle for the sake of inspiring\r\nvalour and discipline into the soldiery (A.D. 586 and 588). Among the\r\nmany gems in which Bede’s _Ecclesiastical History_[139] abounds is\r\nthat picture of the arrival of Augustine and his companions in Thanet\r\n‘bearing a silver cross for their banner, and the image of our Lord\r\nand Saviour painted on a board’ (A.D. 597). The sixteenth-century\r\nchronicler Baronius says, that the picture which Gregory carried\r\nin this plague procession of A.D. 590 was that of the Madonna, now\r\npreserved in the church of S. Maria Maggiore on the Esquiline, and\r\nstill believed to protect Rome from plague and pestilence. Rome has\r\nno fewer than four pictures of the Madonna attributed like this one\r\nto the hand of Luke the Physician, and all of them reputed to have\r\nwonder-working powers. Expert opinion, alas! pronounces the oldest of\r\nthem a fifteenth century production.\r\n\r\nGregory’s procession has afforded a favourite theme for art. It is\r\nthe subject of one of the frescoes in the Lady Chapel of Winchester\r\nCathedral executed under the direction of Prior Silkstede at the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. The scene is also shown in a\r\npicture in the Chiesa del San Pietro at Perugia, in a modern picture by\r\nthe Austrian painter Hiremy Hirsch, and in several others elsewhere.\r\nThe miniature figured on the opposite page is one of two from a\r\nbeautiful Livre d’Heures, of the early fifteenth century, and once\r\nthe property of the Duc de Berry. It is now in the Musée Condé of the\r\nChâteau de Chantilly.\r\n\r\nAn Italian tradition refers the custom of saying ‘Bless you’, when a\r\nperson sneezes, to the time of the pestilence of Gregory, in which all\r\nthose that sneezed were said to have died. Boersch, quoting from the\r\nlocal chronicles of Kleinlauel and of Oseas Schadaeus, would trace its\r\norigin to the plague at Strasbourg in A.D. 591.[140] ‘And when any one\r\nsneezed, he gave up the ghost forthwith. Hence the saying “God help\r\nyou”. And when any one yawned, he died. Hence it comes that when any\r\none yawns, one makes the sign of the cross before the mouth.’ Probably\r\nthe association is even older than this, for Thucydides speaks of\r\nsneezing in the plague of Athens. Sneezing and yawning were prominent\r\nfeatures of the Sweating Sickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V (Face Page 95)\r\n\r\nFRESCO IN S.

Paul\r\nthe Deacon[141] says that eclipses of both sun and moon in May were\r\nfollowed by pestilence in the months of July, August, and September.\r\nDescribing its ravages at Ticinum (Pavia) Paul says that ‘the number\r\nof the dead was so great that parents were often carried to burial on\r\nthe same biers as their children, and brothers along with sisters....\r\nAnd then many saw with their own eyes a good and a bad angel passing\r\nthrough the city by night. And whenever at the bidding of the good\r\nangel, the bad one, who seemed to carry a lance in his hand, struck\r\nso many times with his lance on the door of each house, as many of\r\nthat household would die on the following day. Then it was revealed to\r\nsome one that the plague would not cease until an altar was set up to\r\nSebastian, saint and martyr, at the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli.\r\nThis was done, and as soon as the altar was set up, the relics of the\r\nmartyr-saint Sebastian were brought from Rome, and forthwith the plague\r\nceased.’\r\n\r\nPaul the Deacon, beyond all doubt, was referring to the church of S.\r\nPietro in Vincoli at Pavia, but the Romans of later date claimed the\r\nlegend for their own church of the same name, in which it has been\r\nembodied in a fresco of the fifteenth century, ascribed to Pollajuolo\r\n(1429-98). In the background, at the summit of a flight of stairs,\r\npresumably suggested by those of Ara Coeli, a citizen is telling to\r\nPope Agatho, who is seated among his cardinals, his dream that the\r\npestilence will not cease till the body of S. Sebastian is brought into\r\nthe city. On the right the good angel indicates the condemned houses\r\nto the bad angel in the guise of the Evil One, who strikes on the door\r\nwith his lance. On the left a procession, carrying a banner on which\r\nthe Madonna is depicted with robe spread out in protecting attitude,\r\nis bringing in the relics. The foreground is strewn with corpses of\r\nthe dead. In the sky, bow in hand, hovers the angel that spreads the\r\npestilence. To the left is a group of the Almighty and angels, now\r\nalmost obliterated.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally recognized that the well-known picture ‘La Peste à\r\nRome’, by Delaunay (A.D. 1828-91), now in the Musée du Luxembourg at\r\nParis, was directly inspired by this fresco. The scene is laid in a\r\nstreet of Rome, which is strewn with bodies of dead and dying, among\r\nwhich the good and evil angels are busy at their task. The figure\r\nof a youth huddled up in a brown shawl on a doorstep is a living\r\npicture of misery. In the background a procession bearing a cross is\r\ndescending a flight of stairs, and a fire to purify the atmosphere is\r\nburning in the open street. An effigy of Aesculapius and a colossal\r\nequestrian statue of Constantine are introduced in the manner of the\r\nRenaissance. The chief merit of the picture lies in the excellence of\r\nits draughtsmanship.\r\n\r\nIn this same church at Rome is a mosaic effigy of Sebastian, believed\r\nto have been executed in A.D. 683. In spite, however, of the name of\r\nSebastian, that it carries in gold mosaic letters, it is difficult to\r\nbelieve that it is anything but a figure of St. Peter, transformed\r\nperhaps in the presence of this epidemic to that of Sebastian. It\r\nrepresents faithfully the traditional lineaments of the apostle, an old\r\nman with white hair and beard, dressed in the true Byzantine style.\r\nKugler considers that the careful shadowing of the drapery, executed\r\nwith more than usual pains, indicates that the effigy was intended\r\nto be exposed to the close gaze of the pious. The figure on its blue\r\nmosaic background is stiff and inanimate, even beyond other similar\r\narchaic effigies. Beside it, on a marble tablet, is an inscription in\r\nLatin, reproducing almost to a word the story told by Paul the Deacon.\r\nTradition has it that Pope Agatho (A.D. 678-82) on this occasion caused\r\nthe bones of the saint to be collected in the cemetery of Calixtus, and\r\nbrought to the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, there to be enshrined\r\nbeneath an altar. In the ninth century the body seems to have been\r\nremoved for safety to the Vatican, and again transferred to the church\r\nof S. Sebastiano, where it now is, by Honorius III in A.D. 1216. This\r\nchurch, however, was completely rebuilt in A.D. 1611.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI LA PESTE À ROME. BY DELAUNAY\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Giraudon, Paris (Face Page 96)]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of this pestilence in A.D. 680, Sebastian was universally\r\nrecognized as the patron saint of pestilence. Gradually he comes to be\r\nidentified more particularly with true plague, but never in the same\r\nexclusive fashion as his brother saint, St. Roch. His comprehensive\r\npatronage of pestilence indicates not only how rife were other epidemic\r\ndiseases besides true plague, but how little they were differentiated\r\nin the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe story of the life of Sebastian[142] is well authenticated in its\r\nmain incidents. Born in the middle of the third century A.D., he was\r\na native of Narbonne in Gaul. His noble birth secured for him early\r\nin life the command of a company of Praetorian Guards, so that he\r\nwas constantly about the person of the Emperor. Though secretly a\r\nChristian and using his position to secure the conversion of others\r\nto Christianity, he remained intensely loyal to the temporal interest\r\nof the Emperor. Among his friends were two young soldiers, Marcus and\r\nMarcellinus, like him of noble birth. They were convicted of embracing\r\nChristianity, and after enduring torture bravely were led out to die.\r\nOn the way their aged parents, their wives and children, and their\r\nfriends, implored them to relent, and they were about to recant, when\r\nSebastian rushed forward and exhorted them not to renounce their\r\nRedeemer. So inspiring was his appeal, that the whole assembly, guards,\r\njudges, and all, were converted and baptized, and for a while Marcus\r\nand Marcellinus were saved. This scene is depicted in a spirited canvas\r\nby Veronese in the plague church of S. Sebastiano at Venice. Their\r\nrespite was but short, for in a few months they were put to death with\r\nmany others of the Christian community, and Sebastian himself was\r\ncondemned to die. The Emperor Diocletian (A.D. 284-305), by reason\r\nof his personal attachment, sent for him and exhorted him to abjure\r\nhis heresy, but Sebastian meekly and courageously refused. Diocletian\r\nthen ordered that he should be bound to a stake and shot to death with\r\narrows, and that an inscription should be placed on the stake for all\r\nto see, saying that he was put to death only for being a Christian. A\r\nvast number of pictures, beside the masterpiece of Sodoma,[143] depict\r\nthis scene. Pierced with arrows, Sebastian was left for dead, but at\r\nmidnight Irene, the widow of one of his martyred friends, came to take\r\naway his body for burial, but found him still alive, the arrows having\r\npierced no vital part. She and her attendants carried him to her house\r\nand tended him, till he was completely healed. After this they urged\r\nhim to leave Rome, but Sebastian went boldly to the palace gate, and as\r\nthe Emperor passed out, pleaded for those Christians who were condemned\r\nto suffer for their faith, and reproached Diocletian for his cruelty.\r\nThe Emperor in fierce anger ordered his guards to seize Sebastian and\r\ncarry him to the circus, there to beat him to death with clubs. To\r\nconceal his dead body from his friends it was thrown into the Cloaca\r\nMaxima, but a Christian woman, Lucina, received tidings in a vision of\r\nwhere the body lay, and recovering it had it secretly buried in the\r\ncatacombs. The church of S. Sebastiano at Rome is now built over these\r\ncatacombs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII (Face Page 99)\r\n\r\nSEBASTIAN AS PROTECTOR AGAINST PESTILENCE\r\n\r\nBy Benozzo Gozzoli. Photograph by Brogi, Florence]\r\n\r\nThough Sebastian was martyred in A.D. 288, it was not till the plague\r\nof A.D. 683 that his cult as a protector from pestilence was firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe association of Sebastian with pestilence was in the first instance\r\npurely fortuitous. Devout men in seasons of pestilence were wont to\r\nacclaim their own peculiar patron saint a very present help in time of\r\ntrouble: an altar, a church, a votive picture, a procession, these,\r\nnow one, now another, were the price of the promised dispensation. But\r\nthat Sebastian came to be the patron saint of plague and pestilence\r\nwas due to the association of arrows with his effigy and with the\r\nstory of his attempted martyrdom. From remote antiquity we have seen\r\nthat arrows have been emblematic of plague. It was Apollo among the\r\nGreeks that scattered pestilence with his bow, and who was invoked also\r\nby sacrifice and hymns of praise to avert it. In Christian hagiology\r\nand Christian art Sebastian is the counterpart of the pagan Apollo.\r\nWhatever the variations of detail, Sebastian is practically always\r\nrepresented, either transfixed with arrows or carrying an arrow in his\r\nhand. Having regard to his story, it is a mistake to show the arrows\r\npiercing a vital part, such as the heart, the brain, or even the neck,\r\nas is often done. And for artistic effect it is well that they should\r\nnot be so numerous as to suggest a well-filled pin-cushion: albeit the\r\n_Golden Legend_ has it that ‘the archers shot at him till he was as\r\nfull of arrows as an urchin is full of pricks’.\r\n\r\nSuch is the effect of an interesting fresco by Benozzo Gozzoli (_c._\r\nA.D. 1420-97) in the Chiesa della Collegiata at San Gimignano,\r\ndedicated to Sebastian in A.D. 1465 in a time of plague. At the head of\r\nthe picture, Christ, with the marks of wounds in His hands, communes\r\nwith the Virgin and a group of saints. Sebastian is standing on a\r\npedestal, his whole body studded with arrows, while archers on either\r\nside of him are rapidly increasing the number. This Collegiata fresco\r\nhas been closely followed in an Italian _Pestblätter_, reproduced in\r\nthe Heitz-Schreiber portfolio of _Pestblätter_ (q.v.).\r\n\r\nAnother votive fresco in the church of S. Agostino at San Gimignano,\r\nalso by Benozzo Gozzoli, commemorating the disastrous plague of A.D.\r\n1464, shows Sebastian turning aside with his cloak the broken arrows\r\nof pestilence. In the uppermost part of the fresco the Almighty is\r\nlaunching forth His shafts, and attendant angels are aiding in the\r\ntask. Between them and Sebastian Christ and the Virgin kneel in an\r\nattitude of prayer. Sebastian stands in the centre of the foreground\r\non a low stone pedestal, on which are inscribed the words, ‘Sancte\r\nSebastiane, Intercede Pro Devoto Populo Tuo.’ His body is fully draped,\r\nand the broken arrows lie behind him, removed by the hands of angels,\r\ntwo of whom hold a crown of martyrdom above his head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII (Face Page 100)\r\n\r\nSODOMA’S SEBASTIAN PLAGUE BANNER (REVERSE)\r\n\r\nSS. Roch and Sigismund, and Brethren of Compagnia di S. Sebastiano\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Alinari, Rome]\r\n\r\nThese older representations of Sebastian by Benozzo Gozzoli, and others\r\nby Albrecht Dürer and the early German school, showing Sebastian as\r\nan elderly bearded man, offer but little attractiveness. By far the\r\nmost beautiful pictures are those of Perugino, Sodoma, and Francia,\r\nwho use his nude and youthful figure, as the Greeks used Apollo, as a\r\nmodel for the exhibition of elegance of form and accuracy of anatomical\r\ndesign. As one of the few nude forms permitted to Christian art, it\r\nis readily understood why Sebastian figures in such a multitude of\r\npictures. The finest example of this type is the peerless masterpiece\r\nof Sodoma (1477-1549), now in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence, one\r\nof the most beautiful creations of Renaissance art. It was formerly\r\na banner, painted in A.D. 1528 for the Sienese Compagnia di San\r\nSebastiano in Camollia, and was carried in procession when Siena\r\nwas afflicted with pestilence. It was kept in the church of the\r\nConfraternity at Siena, until it was removed to Florence in A.D.\r\n1786. The undraped body of the saint is modelled on the lines of the\r\nyouthful Apollo. He is bound to a tree in the foreground of a wild\r\nItalian landscape. His neck, side, and one thigh are transfixed with\r\narrows. The upturned face wears an expression of ecstasy, in spite of\r\nsuffering, as an angel descends to place the crown of martyrdom on his\r\nbrow. Symonds has said of this picture:\r\n\r\n      ‘Gifted with an exquisite feeling for the beauty of\r\n    the human body, Sodoma excelled himself when he was\r\n    contented with a single figure. His St. Sebastian,\r\n    notwithstanding its wan and faded colouring, is still\r\n    the very best that has been painted. Suffering,\r\n    refined and spiritual, without contortion or spasm,\r\n    could not be presented with more pathos in a form of\r\n    more surpassing loveliness. This is a truly demonic\r\n    picture in the fascination it exercises and the memory\r\n    it leaves upon the mind. Part of its unanalysable\r\n    charm may be due to the bold thought of combining the\r\n    beauty of a Greek Hylas with the Christian sentiment of\r\n    martyrdom. Only the Renaissance could have produced a\r\n    hybrid so successful, because so deeply felt.’\r\n\r\nOn the reverse of the banner is the Madonna with the Child in her\r\narms, enthroned on clouds, above a kneeling group of SS. Roch and\r\nSigismund and members of the Compagnia di S. Sebastiano, wearing their\r\ncharacteristic garments. The work is much inferior to that of the\r\nface of the banner, and is said to be in part the work of Beccafumi\r\n(1486-1551).\r\n\r\nAnother superb, but little known picture, by Perugino (A.D. 1446-1524)\r\nin the Musée at Grenoble, shows the same type of nude figure of\r\nSebastian bound to a tree. Face and figure alike are the very\r\nembodiment of youthfulness and grace, verging almost on effeminacy. In\r\nthis picture S. Apolline stands beside Sebastian.\r\n\r\nExceptionally, and more particularly in the older pictures, the\r\nyouthful Sebastian is depicted clothed in the costume of the period,\r\nwith or without an arrow in his hand. In the Brera at Milan is a\r\nfolding altar-piece of five panels by Nicolò da Foligno (A.D. 1430-92),\r\nin which he is represented as a youth in kilted tunic and hose. He is\r\nsimilarly clad in another picture in the Vatican, ‘The Coronation of\r\nthe Virgin and Saints,’ also by Nicolò da Foligno, and in a few others\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nSebastian is very frequently represented in plague pictures along with\r\nother saints: his most frequent companion by far is St. Roch. In the\r\nsacristy of S. Maria della Salute at Venice, itself a plague church,\r\nis Titian’s well-known picture commemorating the great plague of A.D.\r\n1512, in which St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and the physician-saints Cosmo\r\nand Damian stand before the throne of St. Mark, across whose majestic\r\nfigure the shadow of a cloud has fallen. These groups of saints are not\r\ninfrequently represented mediating with the Madonna.\r\n\r\nTravelling through Italy from town to town one becomes aware that the\r\nland of pestilence has been roughly partitioned into separate dominions\r\nunder the tutelage of varying presiding saints. In Milan it is Carlo\r\nBorromeo: in Venice, S. Rocco: in Rome, the Madonna: in Central Italy,\r\nin Siena, and in Florence, S. Sebastiano. In Florence he was the patron\r\nsaint of the Compagnia della Misericordia, the institution that has for\r\nseven centuries been so closely interwoven with the daily life of the\r\ncity, and has left no small mark on the products of Florentine art.\r\n\r\nChristian sculpture has also seized the opportunity of the nude figure\r\nfor a model. Well-known statues are those by Matteo Civitali (_c._\r\n1470) at Lucca, and by Puget (1622-94) in the church of Carignano at\r\nGenoa. A colossal recumbent figure of the saint by Bernini (1598-1680)\r\nlies beneath the high altar of the church of S. Sebastian on the Via\r\nAppia at Rome.\r\n\r\nIn Switzerland especially, but also in southern Germany and\r\nsouth-eastern France, wooden statues of Sebastian are commonly met\r\nwith, mostly belonging to the three centuries following the Black\r\nDeath. Several may be seen in the Historical Museum at Basle, more or\r\nless archaic in character, and a very fine example in the Cluny Museum\r\nat Paris. The same museum also possesses a pair of quaint coloured\r\nhigh reliefs in wood of St. Sebastian and St. Roch respectively.\r\nThese wooden effigies are naturally most common in districts where\r\nwood-carving has been extensively pursued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX (Face Page 102)\r\n\r\nSS. MARK, SEBASTIAN, ROCH, COSMAS AND DAMIAN. BY TITIAN\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Naya, Venice]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that the cult of Sebastian was widespread from\r\nthe first, or that the record of its growth is continuous and unbroken\r\nfrom its inauguration in this Roman plague of A.D. 683. Circumstance\r\nchanced to be arrayed against its continuity. The seventh century\r\nwas not a notable period of plague in Europe, and that was now the\r\ndominating epidemic. There was famine and pestilence in Ireland,[144]\r\nbut its nature is not known, and the kings of Erin faced their Irish\r\nquestion in the spirit of Cromwell. In a season of famine they summoned\r\nthe leading clergy and laity to a council to consider the situation.\r\nNo one, in the circumstances, will dispute the propriety of their\r\ninjunction to clergy and laity to observe a fast. But the further\r\ninjunction that they should employ their hours of abstinence in praying\r\nthat some sickness might carry off the surplus of the lower orders,\r\nas the excess of population was the cause of the famine, is more\r\ndebatable. (‘Petebant ut nimia multitudo vulgi per infirmitatem aliquam\r\ntolleretur, quia numerositas populi erat occasio famis.’) At the\r\ninstance of St. Gerald, who contended that the Almighty could relieve\r\nthe situation more suitably and quite as easily by multiplying the\r\nfruits of the earth, it was proposed to recommend this course to His\r\nadoption, at any rate as a preliminary measure. But clergy and laity,\r\nheaded by the holy St. Fechin, were in no mood for such half-hearted\r\nmeasures as promised no finality, and St. Gerald’s suggestion was set\r\naside. Pestilence followed in due course, and the Divine working was\r\nmade manifest in that it claimed St. Fechin and the two kings of Erin\r\namong its innumerable victims.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the retrocession of plague from Europe after the seventh\r\ncentury, Syria,[145] the Euphrates valley, and Irak were still\r\ndevastated at frequent intervals by recurring epidemics. From this\r\npersistent source it spread as far as Constantinople in A.D. 697 and\r\n794, in the latter case almost completely depopulating Constantinople\r\naccording to Nicephoras Byzantinus. Constantinople was in such intimate\r\nrelation, commercial and political, with Syria and Central Asia that\r\ntransference of plague was wellnigh inevitable. After this there was a\r\nlong lull in Europe, and to a less extent in Syria, until the eleventh\r\ncentury. It is often confidently stated that the Crusades brought\r\nplague back to Europe, but it must not be forgotten that there was a\r\nsevere epidemic of plague on that continent in A.D. 1094, before the\r\nCrusades commenced. Doubtless they served to maintain the continuity\r\nof infection. The pestilence that decimated the army of Louis IX and\r\ncarried off him and his son was by no means certainly bubonic plague.\r\nThe surviving accounts suggest rather cholera or dysentery. Again, in\r\nA.D. 1167, the army of Frederick Barbarossa, while encamped before\r\nRome, was swept away by a pestilence, that seems to have been bubonic\r\nplague, which penetrated into the city also and worked great havoc.\r\nThomas à Becket, writing to Pope Alexander III after the retreat of\r\nFrederick, congratulates him on the Lord having destroyed Sennacherib’s\r\narmy. Again, in A.D. 1230, a destructive inundation of the Tiber\r\nwas followed by plague, that led the Romans to recall the banished\r\npope, Gregory IX. In A.D. 1244 plague was in Florence, and led to\r\nthe institution of the Compagnia della Misericordia. Its foundations\r\nwere laid in the fines paid by wool-porters for the use of foul and\r\nblasphemous language at their meeting-house. One of them, the good old\r\nPiero di Luca Borsi, induced them, when the total had reached a large\r\nsum, to spend it in the provision of six litters, one for each ward of\r\nthe city, and to select two of their members weekly for each litter, to\r\ncarry sick persons to the hospitals or dead bodies to the mortuaries.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1294 plague was again widespread and severe in Europe, and a\r\nsuccession of scattered epidemics, of which the most severe were those\r\nof A.D. 1320 and 1333 respectively in southern France and Spain, led up\r\nto the virulent pandemic of A.D. 1348 and after, commonly known as the\r\nBlack Death.\r\n\r\nOut of the desolate wilderness of the Black Death arose the figure of\r\nSt. Roch,[146] patron saint of the plague-stricken and intercessor\r\nagainst the plague. Born at Montpellier, the son of noble parents,\r\nprobably about A.D. 1295, he seemed designed for a life of sanctity by\r\nthe birthmark of a small red cross on his breast. So Mahomet before him\r\nhad borne in the imprint of a mole between his shoulders the token of\r\nhis divine mission. From boyhood he was attracted by the active virtues\r\nof the Redeemer, and aspired to follow that example rather than to\r\ndevote himself to the life of the cloister. The death of his parents,\r\nbefore he was twenty years old, left him with great riches, which he\r\ndistributed forthwith among the poor and hospitals. His lands he left\r\nin the management of his brother, and set out on foot, as a pilgrim,\r\nfor Rome. On his way he found plague raging at Aquapendente. There he\r\ngave himself to the service of the sick in the hospital, and such was\r\nhis skill and sympathy that his ministrations were regarded as more\r\nthan human. The sick seemed to be healed by his mere prayers, or by the\r\nsign of the Cross as he stood over them, so that when the plague soon\r\nceased, they in their enthusiasm attributed it to his intercession. So\r\nRoch himself became inspired with the belief in a divine Providence\r\nspecially guiding his ministry. Hearing that plague was devastating\r\nthe province of Romagna, he hastened thither and devoted himself to\r\nthe sick in the cities of Casena and Rimini. Thence he went to Rome,\r\nwhere plague was raging fiercely (_c._ 1306), and for three years\r\ntended the sick, devoting himself to those most destitute of help. His\r\nconstant prayer to God was that he might be a martyr in his task, but\r\nfor long he passed unscathed through daily peril. Visiting city after\r\ncity, wherever plague was rife, he succumbed at last to the infection\r\nat Piacenza, while nursing the sick in the hospital. Along with a\r\nburning inward fever, a horrible ulcer broke out on his left thigh. The\r\npain was so intolerable that he shrieked aloud. Fearing to disturb the\r\ninmates of the hospital, he crawled into the street, but the officers\r\nwould not let him remain there for fear of spreading infection. With\r\nthe aid of his pilgrim’s staff he dragged himself to a solitary spot\r\noutside the gates of Piacenza, and there laid himself down to die. But\r\nstill a kind Providence watched over him. His little dog, that had\r\nattended him faithfully in all his pilgrimage, went daily into the city\r\nand brought back a loaf of bread, none knew whence. An angel came, too,\r\nand dressed his sore and tended him, till he was well. Others say that\r\nit was the dog of a countryman, one Gothard, that brought food to him.\r\nOn his recovery he turned his steps back to his native Montpellier,\r\nbut his sufferings had so changed him that even his own retainers\r\nthere did not recognize him. He was arrested as a spy, and condemned\r\nby the judge, who chanced to be his own uncle, to be thrown into the\r\npublic prison. Roch, believing it to be God’s will, yielded to the\r\npunishment without revealing his identity, and languished in a dungeon\r\nfor five years. One morning, when the jailer entered his cell, he found\r\nit filled with a bright supernatural light, but his prisoner dead,\r\nand by his side a writing that revealed his name and the words: ‘All\r\nthose that are stricken by the plague, and who pray for aid through\r\nthe merits and intercession of St. Roch, the servant of God, shall be\r\nhealed.’ His uncle, the judge, gave him an honourable burial, and the\r\nwhole city lamented his death.\r\n\r\nSt. Roch is believed to have died in A.D. 1327 in his thirty-second\r\nyear. At Montpellier he was venerated from the first, and this\r\nveneration was quickened and extended by the great pandemic of A.D.\r\n1348. But it was not till the fifteenth century that his cult became\r\nwidespread. This was the direct consequence of an outbreak of plague\r\nat Constance in A.D. 1414, during that Council of prelates that\r\ncondemned Huss to the stake. They were about to disperse and fly from\r\ndanger, when a young German monk told them of the power of St. Roch.\r\nOn his advice the Council ordered an effigy of the Saint to be carried\r\nin procession through the streets with prayers and litanies: and\r\nimmediately the plague was stayed. His festival has been celebrated for\r\ncenturies on the sixteenth day of August.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1485 the Venetians, who from their trade with the Levant,\r\nwere constantly subject to plague, carried off the body of St. Roch\r\nfrom Montpellier by stealth, and the church of San Rocco was built to\r\nreceive it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the legend of St. Roch. He and Sebastian commonly figure\r\ntogether in dedicatory plague pictures, as dual protectors against\r\nplague. They seem to represent in art two attitudes to suffering,\r\nSt. Roch that of compassion, St. Sebastian that of courage and\r\nresignation—two attitudes well expressed in four short lines of an\r\nobscure Australian poet that deserve to be better known than they are:\r\n\r\n    Life is mostly froth and bubble:\r\n      Two things stand like stone:\r\n    Kindness in another’s trouble,\r\n      Courage in your own.\r\n\r\nComing into general knowledge about the time of the revival of art, the\r\nlegend of St. Roch and his figure were favourite and familiar subjects\r\nin the Christian art of the West. The whole legend has been frequently\r\nused as a theme for the decoration of churches dedicated to his name:\r\nsuch a one may be seen in Siena, and another, though less complete, in\r\nVenice. In the Scuola di S. Rocco his life-story is set out in a series\r\nof twenty carved reliefs on the walnut panelling of the upper hall.\r\n\r\nSometimes several scenes from his life are blended in a single picture.\r\nIn the Brera, at Milan, is a picture of St. Roch with Madonna and\r\nChild, by Ambrogio da Fossano, called ‘Borgognone’ (A.D. 1480-1523). In\r\nthe background are scenes from his life, among which his dog is shown\r\ncarrying a loaf in its mouth. The picture formerly belonged to the\r\nCompany of Charity of Milan.\r\n\r\nSt. Roch is generally represented as a man in the prime of life, with\r\na short pointed beard, delicate features, and a gentle expression of\r\ncountenance. As a rule he wears a pilgrim’s dress, with a cockle-shell\r\nin his hat and a wallet at his side. In one hand he holds a long staff,\r\nwhile with the other he lifts his robe to show the plague sore in his\r\ngroin or thigh. Very rarely he is figured as a youth in the dress of\r\nthe period, and is then nearly always introduced to balance a similar\r\nSebastian.\r\n\r\nNumerous pictures deal with single episodes in his life—his tending\r\nthe plague-sick, his healing by an angel, his life and death in prison.\r\nThe best known are perhaps those by Tintoretto in the church of S.\r\nRocco at Venice. Many show him praying among the sick, as in the\r\npicture by Domenichino of Bologna (A.D. 1584-1641) in the Palazzo Rosso\r\nat Genoa. An angel with a drawn sword hovers over the scene, and St.\r\nRoch holds out one arm, as though entreating the angel to put up his\r\nsword into its sheath. Jacopo Bassano (A.D. 1510-92), in a picture in\r\nthe Brera, represents him among a number of plague victims, with hand\r\nraised in attitude of benediction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X (Face Page 108)\r\n\r\nS. ROCH. BY AMBROGIO BORGOGNONE\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Anderson, Rome]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI (Face Page 109)\r\n\r\nAN INTERCESSORY PLAGUE PICTURE BY NIKLAUS MANUEL. S. ROCH TENDED BY AN\r\nANGEL]\r\n\r\nA picture by the Swiss painter, Niklaus Manuel (A.D. 1484-1530), at\r\nBasle, painted in tempera on linen, shows St. Roch with a little angel\r\ntending his wound. It is typical of a large group of intercessory\r\nplague pictures. At the summit of the picture is the Almighty in\r\nglory in the heavens. Beneath Him is St. Anna with the Virgin Mary\r\nand the Child Jesus: they are placed between the Almighty and the\r\nplague-stricken to indicate that they are the appropriate medium of\r\nintercession. They are flanked on the one side by St. Roch, and on the\r\nother by St. James. St. Anna appears in many pictures of this period,\r\nas Pope Alexander II in 1494 promoted her worship, by making her\r\nfeast-day one of the chief festivals of the Church. At the foot of the\r\npicture is a rough delineation of the city attacked by plague: on the\r\nright of it, a group representing probably the donors of the picture:\r\non the left, a group of sufferers, two of whom show plague marks on\r\ntheir limbs. On the woman’s arm is a raised sore: on the man’s arm\r\nblack petechial blotches, on his body large circular spots, and an open\r\nred ulcer on the inner side of his leg.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous pictures of St. Roch is the altar-piece by\r\nRubens, at Alost, near Brussels. The upper part of the picture shows\r\nthe interior of a prison illuminated by a supernatural light. St.\r\nRoch kneels looking up into the face of Christ, in radiant gratitude,\r\nas he receives his commission as patron saint against the plague. An\r\nangel holds a tablet on which is written, ‘Eris in peste patronus,’ in\r\nallusion to the words revealed in his cell at his death.\r\n\r\nStatues of St. Roch are hardly so frequently met with as those of\r\nSebastian: he was a less attractive model for sculptors. In the Musée\r\nof Grenoble is a quaint archaic wooden figure of St. Roch of the early\r\nfifteenth century, which stood formerly in the chapel of the Château of\r\nBressieux. It shows him in pilgrim guise, holding aside his garments to\r\nshow the bubo in his left groin. It is deeply incised, according to the\r\nsurgical practice of the period.\r\n\r\nThe plague mark of St. Roch is depicted in a variety of forms.\r\nSometimes it is simply a bubo in the groin, usually the left, or just\r\nbelow it, to satisfy artistic decency. This form may be seen in a\r\npicture by Crivelli (A.D. 1468-93) of ‘Four Saints’, in the Academy at\r\nVenice, and in another of St. Roch and St. Sebastian, by Alfani, in the\r\nPinacotheca at Perugia.\r\n\r\nFar more commonly the mark is a short longitudinal incision in the\r\nupper part of either thigh, as in Sodoma’s plague banner (see Plate\r\nVIII, p. 100).\r\n\r\nSometimes the incision is in the substance of a bubo. This may be seen\r\nin a portrait of St. Roch over a side-altar in the church of S. Maria\r\ndei Servi at Siena.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the incision is slanting or transverse and displays\r\na complete disregard for the femoral artery. A notable example is\r\nTitian’s ‘St. Mark and Saints’ in the Salute at Venice (see Plate IX,\r\np. 102).\r\n\r\nSometimes the hose is slit over the incision in the flesh, as though\r\nsome bold and busy surgeon had been pressed for time. This may be seen\r\nin Caroto’s picture of ‘Four Saints’ in the church of S. Fermo Maggiore\r\nat Verona: also in a picture by Perugino, ‘Virgin and Saints,’ in\r\nthe cathedral at Perugia, and in another of St. Roch in the Palazzo\r\nBorromeo at Milan.\r\n\r\nA solitary example of St. Roch with a black pustule on the inner side\r\nof his left thigh, surrounded by a pink zone of inflammation, may\r\nbe seen in the Brera. The picture is by Bernardino Borgognone (A.D.\r\n1490-1524).\r\n\r\nIn some of the _Pestblätter_ a gash in the thigh is shown as well as a\r\nsmall circle, which would seem to indicate the circular plague pustule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII (Face Page 110)\r\n\r\nMADONNA AND CHILD, S.

It is still\r\nprofitable, however, to investigate its by-effects in the domains of\r\nliterature and art, and to consider its broad morbid features, as\r\na contribution to the medical history of the time. The Black Death\r\nwas the first great pandemic that left in its wake a complete and\r\ncontinuous succession of literary and historical records, in most\r\npoints complementary, in some frankly contradictory, but for all that\r\nnone the less instructive.\r\n\r\nAs to the starting-point of the pandemic there is a diversity of\r\nvoices. Russian records place it in India, Greek in Scythia, English in\r\nIndia and Asiatic Turkey, Arabian in Tartary and the land of darkness.\r\nAccording to Italian tradition it originated in Cathay, to the north\r\nof China, and spread in every direction from that focus; northward by\r\nBokhara and Tartary to the Black Sea; to India and the towns south of\r\nthe Caspian, and to Asia Minor; and by way of Baghdad through Arabia\r\nand Egypt to the north of Africa. The leading contemporary Italian\r\nauthority is Gabrielle de Mussi, a notary of Piacenza, who himself saw\r\nits outbreak in Upper Italy. In his ‘Ystoria de morbo seu mortalitate\r\nqui fuit a 1348’, first printed by Henschel in Haeser’s _Archiv für die\r\ngesammte Medicin_, he describes how the plague was brought by ship from\r\nCaffa; a Genoese settlement in the Crimea. The Tartar city Tana (Port\r\nAzov), that had been appropriated by Italian merchants, was besieged\r\nin A.D. 1346 by an army of Tartars and Saracens. The Tartars expelled\r\nthem, and followed them to Caffa, whither they had fled. Plague broke\r\nout fiercely among the besieging Tartars, who, in the hope of infecting\r\nthe garrison, threw their dead bodies into the city by means of engines\r\nof war. The garrison in turn cast them into the sea, but the city\r\nbecame infected and almost completely depopulated, a few survivors\r\ntaking ship and carrying the disease with them to Italy in the autumn\r\nof A.D. 1347. Speaking of the infection of Caffa, de Mussi says ‘the\r\nair became tainted and the wells of water poisoned, and in this way the\r\ndisease spread rapidly in the city’. So the old idea of poison still\r\nprevails, but it is a virus derived from infected corpses, and not some\r\nextraneous poison compounded by a maleficent enemy. The poison was\r\ncommunicable also from man to man, for he says of the sailors coming\r\nfrom Caffa to Venice and Genoa that ‘as if accompanied by evil spirits,\r\nas soon as they approached the land, they were death to those with whom\r\nthey mingled’.\r\n\r\nThese ships seem to have infected Constantinople _en route_, and an\r\naccount of its ravages there survives from the pen of the Emperor\r\nCantacuzenus.[147] It is a mistake to regard his record as worthless\r\nmaterial, because of its plagiarism of much of the language of\r\nThucydides. In what is not appropriated from this source he gives a\r\nvaluable clinical description of the disease. He notes the early low\r\ndelirium, and distinguishes pneumonic, bubonic, and carbuncular types\r\nof the disease. He mentions cervical and axillary, but not inguinal\r\nbuboes, and also the dark patches on the skin, that later came to be\r\ntermed ‘tokens’. He also asserts the incidence of the disease on the\r\ndomestic animals.\r\n\r\nIn making for Genoa these ships put in at Messina in Sicily and left\r\nthe infection there. Michael Platiensis (of Piazza), a Franciscan\r\nfriar, has given an account of its course in this city. He refers to\r\ninfection by means of the breath, and by contact with the belongings\r\nof, the infected. Gabrielle de Mussi seems to hold a similar belief.\r\n‘We’ [i. e. the Genoese sailors], he says, ‘reach our homes: our\r\nkindred and our neighbours come from all parts to visit us. Woe to us,\r\nfor we cast at them the darts of death! Whilst we spoke to them, whilst\r\nthey embraced us and kissed us, we scattered the poison from our lips.\r\nGoing back to their homes, they soon infected their whole families.’\r\n\r\nDe Mussi explicitly asserts that the plague was carried from the\r\nseaport of Genoa by some Genoese to Bobbio, and to his city of\r\nPiacenza. Here such was the mortality that ‘no prayer was said, no\r\nsolemn office sung, nor bell tolled for the funeral of even the noblest\r\ncitizen: but by day and night the corpses were borne to the common\r\nplague pit without rite or ceremony’.\r\n\r\nSo Italy had been primarily infected at Venice and at Genoa, and from\r\nthese sea-coast cities the disease spread itself over the whole Italian\r\npeninsula.\r\n\r\nAt Venice the example of Galen had sunk deep into the hearts of her\r\nphysicians. They fled before the advancing enemy and shut themselves up\r\nin their houses, leaving the surgeons, led by Andrea di Padova, to fill\r\ntheir place. Physicians would do well to bear this occasion in mind,\r\nwhen they complain of the encroachments of surgery into the domain of\r\nmedicine. On March 30, A.D. 1348, the Grand Council of Venice appointed\r\nthree men to act as a Committee of Public Safety. These men had large\r\nburial-pits dug in one of the islands of the lagoon, and organized a\r\nservice of boats to transport the bodies to them.\r\n\r\nRome was not so hard hit as some of the cities of Italy. Nevertheless,\r\nthere remains to this day a monument of this plague in the flight\r\nof marble steps leading up to the church of Ara Coeli. These were\r\nset up by Giovanni de Colonna in October 1348, out of the spoils of\r\nthe temple of the Sun on the Quirinal, and were designed for the use\r\nof the citizens, who with ropes round their necks and with ashes on\r\ntheir heads climbed the hill barefooted, to implore from the Blessed\r\nVirgin the cessation of the plague. The thirteenth-century mosaic of\r\nthe Madonna and Child may still be seen above the side entrance of\r\nAra Coeli at the head of the well-worn stairs leading up from the\r\nCapitoline Piazza. The object of worship remains, but the worshippers\r\nare no more.\r\n\r\nLanciani[148] has reproduced an old engraving showing women ascending\r\nthe marble stairs on their knees. This staircase would seem to be\r\nindicated both in Delaunay’s picture and in the fresco by which it was\r\ninspired.\r\n\r\nThere is a legend in Rome, that as the panic-stricken people were\r\ncarrying an effigy of the Madonna from the Ara Coeli to St. Peter’s,\r\nthe statue of the angel on the Castel S. Angelo bowed its head to do\r\nhomage to it.\r\n\r\nPlague was not the only enemy in Rome in A.D. 1348, for a terrible\r\nearthquake on September 9 and 10 wrought havoc among the remaining\r\nmonuments of ancient Rome. Those citizens, who had escaped the plague\r\nand from death among the falling ruins, lived for weeks in the open\r\nCampagna with no shelter from the inclemency of the weather. Perhaps it\r\nwas this accident that served to bring the visitation to an end at Rome\r\nmore rapidly than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAgnolo di Tura, in his _Cronica Senese_, edited by Muratori, gives a\r\ngraphic picture of the Black Death in Siena. A large uninteresting\r\npicture in the church of S. Maria dei Servi depicts St. Catharine\r\nattending the plague-stricken, and there is an ugly, almost ludicrous,\r\nfresco of the same subject in the House of St. Catharine of Siena. The\r\npainter brothers Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti were both carried off\r\nby plague. But it is in the Duomo itself that the mark of the Black\r\nDeath is most apparent. Begun in A.D. 1339, on the site of an older\r\ncathedral dedicated to the Madonna of the Assumption, the transepts\r\nwere built, the foundations of the nave and choir were laid, and their\r\nwalls partly raised according to the designs of Lando Orefice, when\r\nthe Black Death broke out in the city in A.D. 1348. The money collected\r\nfor the building was diverted to urgent public purposes, and the work,\r\nonce suspended, has never been completely accomplished. The present\r\ncathedral, splendid as it is, is a mere fragment of the magnificent\r\nfabric, in which Orefice purposed to enshrine a memorial to the glory\r\nof fourteenth century Siena.\r\n\r\nThe little Cappella di Piazza, attached as a loggia to the Palazzo\r\nPublico of Siena, was set up in gratitude for the cessation of the\r\nplague that carried off no less than thirty thousand persons. It was\r\ncommenced in A.D. 1352 and completed in A.D. 1376. Hard by Siena\r\nthe citizens of San Gimignano vowed an altar to St. Fabian and St.\r\nSebastian as the price of their protection, and set it up between the\r\ndoors of the Pieve or Collegiata. Above the place where once it stood\r\nis now the fresco of Benozzo Gozzoli, commemorating the plague of A.D.\r\n1464.\r\n\r\nNo less a man than Petrarch[149] has chronicled this plague at Parma.\r\nHis letter is in no sense descriptive, but rather a long-drawn-out\r\nwail over the devastation, the loss of friends and relations, and\r\nthe magnitude of the destruction, that seemed to him to threaten the\r\nutter extinction of the human race. Affectation is the key-note of\r\nhis lamentations, that are freely interspersed with allusions to the\r\nancient classics. Laura had died of plague at Avignon in A.D. 1348, and\r\nPetrarch in sadness of soul wrote these lines on the manuscript of his\r\nbeloved Vergil, now in the Ambrosian Library at Milan:\r\n\r\n      ‘Laura, illustrious by her virtues, and long\r\n    celebrated in my songs, first greeted my eyes in the\r\n    days of my youth, the 6th April, 1327, at Avignon; and\r\n    in the same city, at the same hour of the same 6th\r\n    April, but in the year 1348, withdrew from life, whilst\r\n    I was at Verona, unconscious of my loss. The melancholy\r\n    truth was made known to me by letters, which I received\r\n    at Parma on the 19th May.’\r\n\r\n      ‘Her chaste and lovely body was interred on the\r\n    evening of the same day in the Church of the Minorites:\r\n    her soul, as I believe, returned to heaven, whence it\r\n    came.’\r\n\r\n      ‘To write these lines in bitter memory of this event,\r\n    and in the place where they will most often meet my\r\n    eyes, has in it something of a cruel sweetness, but I\r\n    forget that nothing more ought in this life to please\r\n    me, which by the grace of God need not be difficult to\r\n    one who thinks strenuously and manfully of the idle\r\n    cares, the empty hopes, and the unexpected end of the\r\n    years that are gone.’\r\n\r\nThe Florentines, by way of rehabilitating their city after the Black\r\nDeath, founded a university, and offered Petrarch a professorial chair,\r\nwhich he declined.\r\n\r\nMatteo Villani[150] wrote a plain unvarnished account of the state\r\nof Florence during the Black Death, but it has found little favour\r\nbeside the lighter sketch that stands as a prelude to the _Decameron_.\r\nHis brother Giovanni, the Florentine historian, was one of the early\r\nvictims, and Matteo takes up his history at the point at which he\r\nleft it, and begins with a description of the epidemic. Famine had\r\npreceded the plague, and like it was regarded as sent by Heaven for\r\nthe punishment of sin. But the energy of the government, in importing\r\ncorn and distributing it to the destitute, had done much to relieve the\r\ndistress, when this worse enemy presented itself at the gates.\r\n\r\nBoth Villani and Boccaccio enlarge on the futility of all measures,\r\npreventive and remedial alike, and the intense infectiveness of the\r\ndisease. They believed that it could be communicated by a look, as well\r\nas by contact with the person or belongings of an infected subject.\r\nBoccaccio mentions the speedy death of two pigs from rooting among some\r\ninfected clothing. Some pinned their faith on strict seclusion: some\r\non temperate living, some on intemperance: others sought safety in the\r\ncarrying of aromatic substances. Both Villani and Boccaccio lay stress\r\non the utter depravity and demoralization engendered by the plague.\r\nGreat uncertainty of life has never failed to generate corresponding\r\nrecklessness. It has always been the same tale in every desperate city;\r\nit was so when Jerusalem, panic-stricken at the threatened attack of\r\nSennacherib, gave itself over to wild revelry: ‘And in that day did the\r\nLord God of Hosts call to weeping and to mourning, and to baldness,\r\nand to girding with sackcloth: but behold joy and gladness, slaying\r\noxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: let us eat\r\nand drink, for to-morrow we die.’ Matteo Villani traces to the Black\r\nDeath the social and moral degeneracy and the political anarchy, that\r\nwere rampant in Florentine life, in the centuries that followed close\r\nupon it. Family affection is apt to reach its lowest ebb in the houses\r\nof a plague-stricken city. Villani and Boccaccio echo the language of\r\nThucydides when they tell of parents deserting children, and husbands\r\nwives, in their hour of need, and the neglect of the sacred rites of\r\nsepulture. The plague raged in Florence from April to September, and\r\nAntoninus, Archbishop of Florence, computes the mortality within the\r\ncity at 60,000 persons, two-thirds of the total population. Boccaccio\r\nactually raises the figure to 100,000 between March and July only,\r\nbut this figure, if correct, must comprise also the surrounding\r\ndistrict, which suffered only less severely than the city itself.\r\nOne bright record stands out against this dark background of social\r\ndemoralization in the devotion of the Compagnia della Misericordia to\r\ntheir self-appointed task. Instituted in A.D. 1244 for the service\r\nof the sick, they now also lent themselves to the transport of the\r\ndead. A picture by Cigoli (A.D. 1559-1613), now in the church of the\r\nMisericordia, shows the brotherhood in red robes—now changed to\r\nblack—gathering up the dead and dying at the foot of Giotto’s Tower.\r\nThe bearers may be seen to this day in the streets of Florence in\r\nthe same robes and hoods masking the whole face but the eyes, but\r\nthe hand-litters and sedans of Cigoli’s picture have now been slung\r\non wheels and sanctified to modern use with the addition of a motor\r\nambulance. Great wealth flowed into the coffers of the guild from men\r\nwho desired to crown a vicious life with a comfortable death and a\r\ndecent burial.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the plague-stricken city, with which Boccaccio has\r\nprefaced his _Decameron_, stand out in striking contrast to the gay\r\nfrivolity of the young men and women round whom his romance ranges.\r\nPlague and pleasure jostle each other in jarring juxtaposition.\r\nBoccaccio of set purpose chose this dark background for the staging of\r\nhis brighter theme. Thucydides had done the same before him, in setting\r\nthe panegyric of Pericles side by side with the plague of Athens: and\r\nManzoni has done so after him in the romance of _Promessi Sposi_.\r\nPerhaps also he had learnt, amid the fierce realities of the plague, to\r\nenvisage life as it is, and so present it to his readers.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr, in tracing the decadence of Roman literature to the Antonine\r\nplague, cites as a parallel illustration the influence of the Black\r\nDeath on early Florentine literature. In the latter case, at any\r\nrate, it is difficult to bring his dictum into line with the actual\r\ncircumstances. It would seem rather that the break in the vernacular\r\nFlorentine literature after Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, was\r\ndeliberate, and in no sense accidental. What Petrarch perceived, and\r\nperceived unerringly, was the poverty of the material on which the\r\nvernacular had maintained a starved existence; and he saw in the\r\nancient classics, in their mythology, in their speculative freedom,\r\nin the principles of their art, liberation from the bondage that the\r\nChurch had laid on literature. What he did not perceive was that\r\nin reverting to ancient modes of thought it was needless, nay even\r\nharmful, to adopt also the language of the ancients. It was not open\r\nto him to see, as it is to us, that no great work of literature has\r\never been produced in any language but that in which the writer speaks\r\nand feels and thinks: any tongue but the tongue of his daily life must\r\nneeds be artificial and inanimate. Petrarch himself little guessed that\r\nwith posterity his fame would rest on his _Rime_ in the vernacular, and\r\nnot on his epistles and multifarious dissertations in a lifeless Latin\r\nlanguage. It is this mistaken teaching of Petrarch that explains the\r\nabrupt break of a century or more in vernacular Florentine literature,\r\nto which the Black Death can have been at most a trivial contributory\r\ncause. As soon as this mistake came to be recognized Florentine\r\nliterature flows on again in its old channel in the full stream of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth century masterpieces of Ariosto, of Tasso, and\r\nthe rest. It was the advice of Petrarch that turned Boccaccio from\r\nthe vernacular to Latin, after he had completed in his _Decameron_\r\na masterpiece of Italian prose. The influence of the classical\r\nrevival that Petrarch had brought to life was destined also slowly to\r\nsecularize Florentine art, but the time of its complete emancipation\r\nwas not yet.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death first touched French soil at Marseilles, brought\r\nthither, it was thought, by ships from Genoa. Simon de Covino, a\r\ndoctor, described the features of the disease as he witnessed it at the\r\nneighbouring town of Montpellier, in Latin hexameter verse. He clearly\r\nrecognized its contagious character, for he says, ‘By a single touch or\r\na single breath of the plague-stricken they perished.’\r\n\r\nOf the plague at Avignon both lay and medical accounts survive. A full\r\ndescription is contained in a letter from an anonymous canon to his\r\nfriends in Bruges. He remarks on the virulence of the contagion, and\r\ndescribes both pneumonic and bubonic types of the disease. He says\r\nthat Clement VI ordered bodies to be examined after death, in the hope\r\nof discovering the origin of the disease. This fact should be noted\r\nby those who assert that the Church interpreted the _De Sepulturis_\r\nbull of Boniface VIII (A.D. 1300) as prohibiting the anatomy of human\r\nbodies. The autopsies disclosed no more than inflammation of the lungs\r\nin the pneumonic cases. Similar examinations, previously undertaken\r\nin Italy, had also yielded no better result. Clement also ordained\r\nexpiatory processions and penitential litanies. Within the precincts\r\nof his palace, to which his medical attendant, Gui de Chauliac,\r\nconfined him, he lent his own presence to the whole ceremonial that he\r\nprescribed. But he did not neglect to keep large fires alight in his\r\napartments, as Pope Nicholas IV (A.D. 1288-92) had done at Rome in a\r\nprevious visitation. Only those who have been at Avignon at midsummer\r\ncan appreciate the price that Clement was ready to pay for immunity.\r\n\r\nClement’s physician, Gui de Chauliac, says that the plague began at\r\nAvignon in January, and lasted for seven months.[151] In his view\r\nthe causes of the pandemic were twofold: universal, consisting in\r\na conjunction of the planets: and special, dependent on the feeble\r\nconstitution of the individual, whereby it came about that labouring\r\nmen were chiefly attacked. But then as now the scared populace was\r\nproof against pontifical pronouncements from the Chair of Medicine.\r\nThey saw in it the handiwork of Jews spreading poison throughout the\r\nworld, so they put them to death. They saw in it malevolence of lepers,\r\nso they drove them out. They saw in it a plot of feudal overlords\r\nfor their extinction, so they remained within their houses. And for\r\ncompleter security they set a guard around the towns and villages, who\r\naccosted each newcomer and compelled him to swallow any ointments or\r\npowders found upon him.\r\n\r\nDe Chauliac describes two prevalent types of the disease. The one\r\ntype, the pneumonic, prevailed only for the first two months, and was\r\ncharacterized by spitting of blood, extreme infectiousness, and death\r\nin three days. The second type, the bubonic, prevailed throughout the\r\nfive succeeding months, and was characterized by boils, by buboes\r\nchiefly in the armpits and groins, by slight infectiousness, and death\r\nin five days. The mortality extended to no less than three-fourths of\r\nthe total population, so that to get rid of the bodies they were driven\r\nto throw them into the Rhone, after Clement had pronounced a blessing\r\non its waters.\r\n\r\nTo Gui de Chauliac the best of all preservatives was flight, aided,\r\nor perhaps we should say embarrassed, by the free use of aloetic\r\npurgatives.\r\n\r\nHe did not fly himself, for he says, with the _naïveté_ of a Pepys,\r\n‘As for me, to avoid infamy, I did not dare absent myself, but still\r\nI was in continual fear.’ (Et moy pour euiter infamie, n’osay point\r\nm’absâter: mais auec continuelle peur me preseruay tant que ie\r\npeux, moyennant les susdicts remedes.) His hesitancy was to prove\r\nhis undoing, for he was himself infected towards the end of the\r\nepidemic—but recovered after six weeks. Among other preservatives\r\nhe reckons venesection, purification of the air by means of fires,\r\ncomforting the heart with treacle and apples and things of savoury\r\nflavour, consoling the humours with Galen’s Armenian bole, and the\r\nprevention of putrefaction by the use of bitter things. Should the\r\ndisease defy all these precautions, then he commends, as curative\r\nmeasures, bleedings and evacuations, with electuaries and cordial\r\nsyrups. Buboes should be ripened with poultices of figs and boiled\r\nonions, pounded and mixed with leaven and butter: then they should\r\nbe opened and treated like ulcers. Carbuncles are to be leeched,\r\nscarified, and cauterized—an improvement on the disastrous treatment\r\nmeted out to Felix, bishop of Nantes, on a previous occasion.\r\n\r\nRaymond Chalin de Vinario, another practitioner in Avignon during\r\nthe plague, adds but little to what Gui de Chauliac has to say. He\r\ndescribes a solid cord, red or variously discoloured, which appeared\r\nin some cases on the body surface, with a carbuncle at one end and a\r\npestilential tubercle at the other. This can hardly have been anything\r\nelse than an acute lymphangitis.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the descriptions of the various writers that a large\r\nproportion of the cases in this pandemic were of pneumonic type: hence\r\nits virulence and its infectiousness.\r\n\r\nAmid all the panic of the Black Death, persecution of the Jews broke\r\nout with even greater ferocity than during the Crusades in the twelfth\r\ncentury. Some victim was needed to appease the maddened populace: so\r\nthe Jews were accused of poisoning the wells, and even of infecting\r\nthe air. Circumstantial accounts were circulated throughout Europe of\r\nsecret operations directed from Toledo. The concoction of poisons from\r\nspiders, owls, and other supposed venomous animals was described, and\r\nits mode of distribution made known. So well did their accusers deceive\r\nthemselves that in many places the springs and wells were sealed, so\r\nthat no one might use them, and the inhabitants of many cities had\r\nto rely on rain and river water. If confirmation of poison were ever\r\nneeded, the rack could be trusted to procure it: or, failing that,\r\nmen could be found vile enough to deposit poison in places in which\r\ncircumstances demanded its presence. Those who escaped the fury of the\r\nmob fell into the clutches of an inexorable justice. In the case of\r\nthe Jews the suspicion of poisoning was prompted by the fact that at\r\nthis time the practice of medicine, at any rate in southern Europe, was\r\nchiefly in the hands of Jewish physicians. Hideous massacres of Jews\r\nhad taken place in southern France and Spain in the previous epidemics\r\nof A.D. 1320 and 1333, as we know from the writings of Rabbi Joshua.\r\n\r\nThe first outbreak of murderous ferocity seems to have occurred at\r\nChillon, on the Lake of Geneva, in September and October, A.D. 1348.\r\nHere it was merely the culmination of an accusation of poisoning the\r\nwells so long previously as the epidemic of A.D. 1320. In face of the\r\ncommon danger, high and low bound themselves together by a solemn oath\r\nto extirpate the Jews by fire and the sword. Chillon summoned Bern, and\r\nBern sent on the summons to Basle, Freyburg, and Strasbourg to join\r\nthem in their righteous task. The record of confessions extracted from\r\nthe Jews by the ordeal of torture within the Castle of Chillon has been\r\nrescued from oblivion by the vigilance of Hecker.[152] In Basle and\r\nFreyburg the Jews were seized, one and all, and without form of trial\r\nwere burnt to death in a wooden building, specially constructed for\r\nthe purpose, while at Strasbourg no less than two thousand Jews were\r\nimmolated on a wooden scaffold, erected in their own burial-ground.\r\nSuch as escaped were ruthlessly murdered in the streets, saving a few\r\nonly to whom freedom was granted on submission to baptism. But for\r\nthese the respite from renewed accusation and death was only temporary.\r\nFaithlessness to their own religion, or physical charms sufficient to\r\nassuage the blood-lust of their Christian persecutors, constituted the\r\nonly acceptable claims to a passing mercy. Strasbourg betrayed the\r\ntrue ground of its hatred of the Jews in an order of its senate that\r\nall pledges and bonds should be returned to the debtors and the money\r\ndivided among the working-people. Those who were unwilling to soil\r\ntheir hands with blood-money presented their share of the spoils to\r\nmonasteries, at the prompting of their confessors. At Spires, Mayence,\r\nand Eslingen, voluntary immolation in their own houses alone saved the\r\nJews from more inhuman tortures. Some were murdered in the open streets\r\nand their dead bodies thrown into the Rhine in empty casks, so that\r\nthey might not infect the air. Now and again banishment was substituted\r\nfor burning, only for the outcasts to perish at the hands of a savage\r\nand blood-thirsty countryfolk.\r\n\r\nWhen the houses of the Jews were burnt a ban was set on entry into\r\nthe ruins of their habitations: the site was accursed, as the site\r\nof Jericho of old. But the bricks of the destroyed dwellings and the\r\ntombstones of the victims were in due time rendered as an acceptable\r\nthank-offering to God in the repair of Christian churches. In Austria\r\nthe same accusations were brought against the Jews as elsewhere, and\r\nnumbers were burnt to death in Vienna and throughout the country. Where\r\nthere were no Jews, as in Leipsic, Magdeburg, and other places, the\r\ngrave-diggers were accused of propagating the plague for their own\r\nsordid ends.\r\n\r\nIt should be set to the credit of Clement VI that he extended his\r\npersonal protection to the Jews at Avignon, issuing two bulls,\r\nasserting their innocence, and calling on Christians to refrain from\r\npersecution. The Emperor Charles IV did what lay in his power, short of\r\ndrawing the sword, to check the outrages perpetrated by the Bohemian\r\nnobles. Duke Albert of Austria exacted from the persecutors punishments\r\nonly less cruel than they themselves had inflicted, but even so did not\r\navail to save hundreds of Jews from the flames, in his own fortress\r\nof Kyberg. Other lesser princes, more often for bribes than for pity,\r\nextended some measure of protection to the wretched Jews, earning for\r\nthemselves the _sobriquet_ of ‘Jew-masters’. It was no light matter for\r\na private person to shelter a Jew, for the penalty was often exacted on\r\nthe rack or at the stake.\r\n\r\nBasnage[153] states that the large number of Jews in modern Poland\r\nmay be traced to the fact that King Casimir the Great (A.D. 1333-70),\r\nyielding to the entreaties of a favourite Jewess, Esther, granted\r\nsanctuary to such Jews as sought it. But actually Casimir only\r\nconfirmed an edict of protection promulgated in A.D. 1264, and Poland\r\nhad then already afforded a haven of refuge to the Jews, who had fled\r\nfrom the cruel massacres perpetrated in the enthusiasm of the first\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nIn England the Black Death served to revive the perennial charges\r\nbrought against the Jews—that they stole Christian children and killed\r\nthem, especially at Easter-time, a charge that Chaucer, mindful of Hugh\r\nof Lincoln, has enshrined in the pathetic verse of his Prioress. They\r\nwere charged also with outraging the Host, as well as with spreading\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death seems to have fallen with greater violence on Austria\r\nthan on Germany,[154] perhaps on account of its close contact with\r\nItaly. It devastated Vienna from Easter to Michaelmas of A.D. 1349,\r\ncarrying off thirty thousand out of a population of less than one\r\nhundred thousand persons. The excited populace personified it as the\r\nPest-Jungfrau, who had only to raise her hand to infect a victim. She\r\nwas to be seen flying through the air in the form of a blue flame,\r\nand also proceeding out of the mouths of dead and dying. Some saw the\r\nplague poison descend in the form of a ball of fire. One such was seen\r\nhovering over the town, but a bishop exorcised it by prayer, so that\r\nit fell harmless to earth. A stone effigy of the Madonna was set up in\r\nthe street, where it fell. All medical aid proved useless, and amulets,\r\npotions, and preservative electuaries were in general use. Segregation\r\nof the sick was attempted, by nailing up doors and windows of infected\r\nhouses, but even so dead bodies littered the streets. Huge plague pits\r\nwere dug for the reception of the dead. Flagellant processions sought\r\nto excite divine compassion by the ritual of peripatetic penitence.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the Flagellant movement must be looked for further\r\nback in the history of pestilence than the Black Death. The idea of\r\nmortifying the flesh by the penance of scourging is of ancient origin,\r\nand at least as early as the eleventh century brotherhoods were\r\ndevoted to this ritual. The processions of these _Devoti_, as they\r\nwere termed in Italy, were originated by St. Anthony in A.D. 1231, and\r\nwe hear of them under the name of Flagellants in Vienna during the\r\nplague of A.D. 1261.\r\n\r\nOne Monachus Paduanus, quoted by Hecker, has left a record of the early\r\ndays of the _Devoti_.\r\n\r\n      ‘When the land was polluted by vices and crimes, an\r\n    unexampled spirit of remorse suddenly seized the minds\r\n    of the Italians. The fear of Christ fell upon all:\r\n    noble and ignoble, old and young, and even children of\r\n    five years of age, marched through the streets with no\r\n    covering but a scarf round the waist. They each carried\r\n    a scourge of leather thongs, which they applied to\r\n    their limbs, amid sighs and tears, with such violence\r\n    that the blood flowed from the wounds. Not only during\r\n    the day, but even by night, and in the severest winter,\r\n    they traversed the cities with burning torches and\r\n    banners, in thousands and tens of thousands, headed\r\n    by their priests, and prostrated themselves before\r\n    the altars. They proceeded in the same manner in the\r\n    villages: and the woods and mountains resounded with\r\n    the voices of those whose cries were raised to God.\r\n    The melancholy chaunt of the penitent alone was heard.\r\n    Enemies were reconciled: men and women vied with each\r\n    other in splendid works of charity, as if they dreaded\r\n    that Divine Omnipotence would pronounce on them the\r\n    doom of annihilation.’\r\n\r\nBefore this mediaeval pageant of penitence the mind insensibly reverts\r\nto the ancient ritual of the Salii on this same Italian soil, to\r\ntheir choric hymn of expiation, to the _supplicationes_, and to the\r\nlove-feast of the _lectisternium_ of later days.\r\n\r\nUnder the stimulus of the Black Death, the Brotherhood of the Cross,\r\nor Cross-bearers, arose out of the ranks of the Flagellants, first in\r\nHungary, and afterwards in Germany. Ditmar[155] has left the following\r\naccount of their processions:\r\n\r\n      ‘Their heads covered as far as the eyes: their look\r\n    fixed on the ground, accompanied by every token of the\r\n    deepest contrition and mourning. They were robed in\r\n    sombre garments, with red crosses on the breast, back\r\n    and cap, and bore triple scourges, tied in three or\r\n    four knots, in which points of iron were fixed. Tapers\r\n    and magnificent banners of cloth of gold were carried\r\n    before them: wherever they made their appearance they\r\n    were welcomed by the ringing of the bells: and the\r\n    people flocked from all quarters, to listen to their\r\n    hymns and to witness their penance, with devotion and\r\n    tears.’\r\n\r\nWhen the Flagellants entered the town they would hand the citizens\r\na document setting forth God’s anger and determination to destroy\r\nmankind, had not the Virgin Mary interceded for them. Some of\r\nthe crosses carried by the Flagellants are still to be seen at\r\nGross-Glogau, Kaysersberg, and Ammerschweyer in Upper Alsace.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of religious fanaticism spread like wildfire through\r\nHungary, Germany, Bohemia, Silesia, Poland, and Flanders, and\r\neven beyond these countries. In the autumn of 1349 some six-score\r\nFlagellants crossed from Holland and paraded the streets of London, but\r\nthe metropolis had not then acquired the taste for processions, and\r\nejected them as undesirable aliens. At last the movement had alighted\r\non uncongenial soil. So great was the number of the Flagellants that\r\nthey became a cause of well-founded anxiety to the clergy, whose\r\nchurches they actually invaded, and whose influence they threatened to\r\nsupersede. Their hymns were in every mouth, and one of them, the chief\r\npsalm of the Cross-bearers, is reproduced by Hecker in his _Epidemics\r\nof the Middle Ages_.\r\n\r\nThe secular authorities also saw cause for alarm at the growing numbers\r\nand power of the brotherhood, bound together by common ritual and\r\ncommon regulations, and capable, under bold and designing leaders, of\r\nexerting their influence in the affairs of states. The Emperor Charles\r\nIV appealed to the Holy See for protection against the heretics, and\r\nClement VI responded by issuing a bull from Avignon on October 20,\r\n1349, prohibiting the pilgrimages on pain of excommunication. Philip\r\nVI forbade altogether their reception in France, and several other\r\nruling princes followed his example. Relentless persecution soon took\r\nthe place of unthinking homage. The processions were abandoned, but the\r\nspirit that animated them was not dead, and the same fanaticism broke\r\nout again in Germany in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and in\r\nItaly even as late as the eighteenth, under the influence of successive\r\nplagues.\r\n\r\nThe Black Death, sweeping throughout England, is believed to have\r\ncarried off one-half of the total population. Historians have told the\r\ntale of the resulting emancipation of the labouring class, but we find\r\nthat it has also left its mark on the education, the literature, the\r\nart, and the architecture of England.\r\n\r\nIn education, it helped greatly to bring about the revival of English\r\nin the schools. After the Norman Conquest French had gradually become\r\nthe language of education: not of set purpose, for the Conqueror\r\nhimself tried ineffectually to learn English. But most of the education\r\nwas in the hands of the clergy, and as many Frenchmen had been put in\r\ncharge of monasteries and of parochial cures, it was inevitable that\r\nFrench should become the language of education, and so diffuse itself\r\ngenerally through the educated part of the nation, both French and\r\nEnglish. About the middle of the fourteenth century Higden, in his\r\n_Polychronicon_, states that French was still the language taught in\r\nthe schools, and had been so since the Norman Conquest. In A.D. 1385\r\nTrevisa, commenting on Higden’s statement, writes:\r\n\r\n      ‘This maner was myche yused tofore the first moreyn\r\n    [before the 1349 murrain], and is siththe som dele\r\n    [since somewhat] ychaungide. For John Cornwaile, a\r\n    maister of gramer, chaungide the lore [learning] in\r\n    gramer scole and construction of [from] Frensch into\r\n    Englisch, and Richard Pencriche lerned that maner\r\n    teching of him, and other men of Pencriche. So that\r\n    now, the yere of owre Lord a thousand thre hundred\r\n    foure score and fyve, of the secunde King Rychard\r\n    after the Conquest nyne, in alle the gramer scoles of\r\n    England children leveth Frensch, and construeth an [in]\r\n    Englisch.’\r\n\r\nDespite the adoption of French as the language of the schools, English\r\nhad survived as a colloquial language side by side with its supplanter.\r\nIn the conflict between the two prestige and fashion were on the side\r\nof French, tradition and nationality on the side of English: and sooner\r\nor later the balance was bound to incline to the side of the national\r\nlanguage. The fusion of the two had inevitably led to the corruption\r\nof each, but the corrupted French, at any rate after the loss of\r\nNormandy, had no standard of purity at hand to limit corruption,\r\nwhile the corrupted English was constantly purified by contact with\r\nthe native tongue, and by the existence of a pre-Norman vernacular\r\nliterature. National spirit, stimulated by international strife, was\r\nripe for completing the task, that John Cornwall had begun in a single\r\nwest country school; and the Black Death, by sweeping away the existing\r\nteachers and making place for others of native stock, did much to\r\nfacilitate the change. The triumph of the vernacular operated a mighty\r\nrevolution in our national literature, paving the way for Langland\r\nand Chaucer. Thomas Usk, in the Prologue to his _Testament of Love_,\r\ncompleted not later than A.D. 1387, alludes to the utter corruption of\r\nthe imported French, and the Prioress in the Canterbury Tales, although\r\nshe could speak French ‘ful fayre and festishly’ spoke it only\r\n\r\n    After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,\r\n    For Frenche of Paris was to hire [her] unknowe.\r\n\r\nOne other immediate effect of the Black Death was to reduce the\r\nliterary output of the monasteries to its lowest level. No one can\r\nfail to be struck by the scantiness and sterility of the contemporary\r\nchronicles, which characterize the period following the Black Death,\r\nand the reasonable explanation of this abrupt change would seem to lie\r\nin the notorious depletion of the monastic households. The tragedy of\r\nthe Provençal brotherhood, in which Petrarch’s brother and his dog\r\nalone survived to tend and guard the monastery, found an echo in a\r\nlike desolation of many an English monastery. The special incidence on\r\nthe monasteries was perhaps due to the monks moving freely among the\r\nsick, and giving them sanctuary within their cloister. The sick, too,\r\nexhibited often an ill-timed gratitude in bequeathing their clothes to\r\nthe monasteries. Doctors, as Chaucer remarked of his day, were only for\r\nthe rich.\r\n\r\nIn England, as in Italy, the Black Death left its mark on architecture\r\nin the abrupt arrest of schemes of construction in course of execution.\r\nMany such breaks may be detected in the church architecture of\r\nthe fourteenth century, and a notable example is furnished in the\r\nunfinished towers of the church of St. Nicholas at Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nPrior[156] indicates a similar break of continuity in the building\r\nof York Minster. The west front and the nave were in course of\r\nconstruction, when the Black Death appeared, and the result is a\r\nmakeshift wood vaulting to the nave. Then the building of the choir\r\nwas delayed for twelve years, till A.D. 1361, and in its structure the\r\nflowing lines of the Decorated style, seen in the west front, have\r\ngiven place to the formal stiffness of the Perpendicular.\r\n\r\nIn London the effect is much less conspicuous than in the northern\r\nparts of England, perhaps because it was easier to replenish the\r\nsupply of masons in the metropolis than elsewhere. The building of\r\nSt. Stephen’s Chapel in Westminster and the completion of the Abbey\r\ncloisters seem to have proceeded continuously, and with no change of\r\nstyle, throughout the Black Death and the following years: and the same\r\nis the case with Gloucester Cathedral.\r\n\r\nPrior considers that the Black Death played a leading part in the\r\nsuperseding of the Decorated by the Perpendicular type, and in the\r\ndiffusion of the latter from its Gloucester home throughout England.\r\nThe lack of builders led to masons passing from one district to\r\nanother, removing them from the conditions of local stone favourable to\r\ntheir best work and to originality of style. The inevitable result was\r\nthat the architectural style easiest of expression in any form of stone\r\nwas bound to prevail, and that style was the Perpendicular. Examples\r\nof this transformation in the years following close on the Black Death\r\nare numerous, in the nave and cloisters of Canterbury Cathedral, in the\r\nwest front of Winchester Cathedral, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe same stereotyped monotony, the same continuous decline in the\r\nskill of execution, the same obvious diminution of interest in the\r\ncraft of the artificer, as is seen in the building construction, are\r\nmanifest also in the figure-sculpture and traceries of the period. The\r\nvariation of artistic expression, that in the two preceding centuries\r\nhad progressed steadily from strength to strength, comes to an abrupt\r\ncessation, and is content with the incessant repetition of inanimate\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\n      ‘The figure-sculpture[157] of the later mediaeval\r\n    church under such conditions grew to be especially\r\n    of the shop, according to pattern and not of fresh\r\n    adventure. It no longer took its place in the business\r\n    of the building-yard, but was provided for—not\r\n    worked—in the building. The constructing mason left\r\n    niches for statues, and on occasion worked bosses\r\n    with subject relief, cornices with ‘angel’ sculpture,\r\n    and gargoyles with ‘devil’ sculpture. But this figure\r\n    work was not essential, and a whole majestic piece\r\n    of architecture in Perpendicular style might rise\r\n    from the ground and never ask for the craft of the\r\n    figure-sculptor at all. The works of the imager were\r\n    now in effect furniture, which could be bought in the\r\n    city and added to the building at any time. Accordingly\r\n    statues and reliefs ceased, in fifteenth century\r\n    practice, to be carved immediately by the mason upon\r\n    the building: they became outside works conceived in no\r\n    intimate relation to it.’\r\n\r\nGasquet maintains that a similar breach of continuity may be observed\r\nin the manufacture of stained glass, and that there is a noticeable\r\nchange in style after the Black Death. Speaking broadly, the styles\r\nof stained glass correspond to the styles of architecture, but in\r\neach case are a little later: so that the contention comes to this,\r\nthat there is an unbridged gap between the late Decorated and early\r\nPerpendicular. Yet one cannot but recall the ante-chapel windows of New\r\nCollege, Oxford, and the east window of Gloucester Cathedral, in each\r\nof which the transition from Decorated to Perpendicular is apparent.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] iv. 8.\r\n\r\n[148] _Golden Days of the Renaissance in Rome._\r\n\r\n[149] _Epistolae de rebus familiaribus_, viii. 7.\r\n\r\n[150] Bk.

Dances of Death,\r\nplague banners, votive and commemorative paintings, and actual\r\nrepresentations of plague scenes all bear silent testimony to the\r\nabiding presence of the enemy within the gates. _Memento mori_, with\r\nits dismal foreboding, was the appropriate motto of the age. Innocent\r\nIII in his _De Contemptu Mundi_ had said the last word on the misery\r\nof human existence, and the shame and degradation of the human body,\r\npolluted and polluting, long before the Black Death: but henceforward\r\nthe gloom that haunted the soul of this great successor of St. Peter\r\nseems to diffuse itself throughout the world.\r\n\r\nDancing from early ages has been associated with the conception of\r\ndeath. In many primitive races these dances seem to pertain to mimetic\r\nmagic, and purport to expedite the passing of the spirit of the\r\ndeceased. Both Greeks and Romans preserved dancing in their funeral\r\ncelebrations, and representations of these funeral dances have been\r\nfound in connexion with Greek and Etruscan tombs. These are commonly\r\na file of maidens, holding each other’s hands, and led by a youthful\r\nmale coryphaeus. Anacreon,[158] Tibullus,[159] and Vergil[160] all\r\ndepict the revelry of the dance in the land of departed souls, and joy\r\nis the key-note of the dance. Christianity, in superseding paganism,\r\nfor better or for worse inculcated a gloomy conception of death,\r\nas a punishment, a penalty for original sin. Recurrent epidemics\r\nof pestilence served to transform the conception into that of an\r\ninexorable foe revelling in the subversion of human happiness and the\r\nfutility of human affairs. The literature of the age no less than\r\nits art bears the imprint of this conception. Petrarch has left us a\r\n_Triumph of Death_, and Langland in his _Vision of Piers Plowman_[161]\r\nhas given us in verse a Dance of Death:\r\n\r\n    Death came driving after, and all to dust pashed\r\n    Kynges and Knightes, Kaysers and Popes,\r\n    Learned and lewde: he ne let no man stande;\r\n    That he hitte even, stirred never after.\r\n    Many a lovely ladie and her lemmans of knightes\r\n    Swouned and swelte for sorwe of Death’s dyntes.\r\n\r\nThe earliest authenticated painting of the Death-dance is that which\r\nwas once to be seen in the churchyard of the Innocents at Paris,\r\npainted in A.D. 1434, but it is improbable that it was actually the\r\nfirst. A closely similar theme of earlier date may still be seen in\r\nthe Campo Santo at Pisa. Vasari attributed it to Andrew Orcagna (A.D.\r\n1329-68), but modern critics believe it to have been painted by Pisan\r\nartists, about A.D. 1350. This fresco shows three young men following\r\nthe chase on horseback. Coming to the cell of St. Macarius, an Egyptian\r\nanchorite, they are brought face to face with three open coffins,\r\nin which are a skeleton and two dead bodies, reminding them of the\r\nfleeting nature of human pleasures. This subject also is one adopted\r\nfrom contemporary literature. Under the title of ‘Les trois Morts et\r\nles trois Vifs’ it had figured in thirteenth-century verse, and is\r\nfrequently illustrated in the manuscript _Horae_ of the period. It is\r\nsuggested that this legend is the origin of the name ‘Danse macabre’,\r\nor ‘Macaber Dance’, used often as an alternative name for the familiar\r\n‘Dance of Death’.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII DANCE OF DEATH, AT BASLE (Face Page 135)]\r\n\r\nIt is not in Italy and not in France, but rather, as we should expect,\r\nin Germany and Switzerland, that these Dances of Death found most\r\nfavour, as befits the countries that gave birth to Luther and shelter\r\nto Calvin. In 1462-3 plague raged fiercely at Lübeck. In the chapel at\r\nthe east end of the Marienkirche is a much restored ‘Dance of Death’,\r\ndated 1463, and showing the costumes of the period. It is interesting\r\nas being considerably older than the more famous Basle Dance.\r\n\r\nBy far the most celebrated ‘Dance of Death’ was that painted in a shed\r\nin the churchyard of the Dominican convent at Basle. It is believed\r\nto have been painted in commemoration of a plague that occurred\r\nduring the session of the Grand Council of Basle, that lasted from\r\nA.D. 1431 to 1443. It has been attributed on insufficient evidence to\r\nHolbein. It was destroyed by a riotous mob in A.D. 1806, but relics\r\nof the life-size figures, painted in oil, are still to be seen in the\r\nHistorical Museum at Basle. Engravings of it also exist that record its\r\ncharacters in detail. Holbein did actually paint a ‘Dance of Death’ in\r\nfresco on the walls of the old Whitehall Palace, which was destroyed in\r\nthe fire of A.D. 1697. It was an appropriate subject for the brush of\r\nan artist, who himself was to die of plague (A.D. 1554). It is probably\r\nreferred to by Matthew Prior in his _Ode to the Memory of George\r\nVilliers_:\r\n\r\n    Our term of life depends not on our deed,\r\n    Before our birth our funeral was decreed,\r\n    Nor aw’d by foresight, nor misled by chance,\r\n    Imperious death directs the ebon lance,\r\n    Peoples great Henry’s tombs, and leads up Holbein’s Dance.\r\n\r\nHolbein was almost certainly also the author of the originals of the\r\nLyons ‘Dance of Death’, from which Hans Lutzenberger engraved the\r\nwoodcuts, which represent a varied assortment of characters of each and\r\nevery social order, among whom Death, in grotesque guise, plies his\r\ngrim and gruesome task.\r\n\r\nThe most casual observer cannot fail to be struck in any collection\r\nof pictures of the Holbein School, with the number that present some\r\naspect or other of death. In the small picture gallery of Basle there\r\nis a picture of two skulls and a tibia, by Ambrose Holbein: a diptych,\r\nwith the bust of a young man on one panel, and a skeleton on the other,\r\nby Hans Holbein the Younger: another sixteenth-century diptych with a\r\nbust of a girl on one panel, and a bust of a skeleton on the other, by\r\nan unknown painter: and two pictures by Hans Baldung (A.D. 1475-1545),\r\none of Death holding a woman by the hair and pointing to a grave: the\r\nother of Death kissing a woman before an open grave.\r\n\r\nPlague banners, or _gonfaloni_,[162] are a characteristic product\r\nof the Umbrian school of painting, and particularly of its Perugian\r\nbranch. It was the lot of Perugian painters to ply their art in the\r\nmidst of tribulations of every kind. Throughout the fifteenth century\r\ntheir country was devastated by war, and by a succession of epidemics\r\nof plague (in A.D. 1399, 1418, 1429, 1437, 1450, 1456, 1460-8, 1475-80\r\nand 1486). In the face of these visitations Perugia set herself to\r\nappeal to the mercy of Christ through the medium of her art. All her\r\npainters scarcely sufficed to provide all the banners required for her\r\nexpiatory and triumphal processions. It was at times such as these\r\nthat the _gonfaloni_ made their appearance, raised between heaven and\r\nearth, as though to convey to God a splendid manifestation of popular\r\nrepentance. Before the suppliant banners marched the priesthood in\r\ntheir robes, behind them followed a penitent people, striking their\r\nbreasts and wailing aloud _Misericordia_. At each fresh invasion of\r\nplague a new generation of artists, beginning with Bonfigli (A.D.\r\n1420-96) and ending with Baroccio (A.D. 1528-1612), was called upon to\r\nproduce afresh these tributes of the popular devotion. The remedy was\r\nwell adapted to their sufferings, for these processions of penitents,\r\ntraversing the city and following banners, that displayed the\r\nfigure of the Redeemer, or the Madonna, or some other plague saint,\r\nproduced in their souls such a degree of spiritual exaltation, as made\r\ndespondency impossible. Men gazed on them as they gazed on the Brazen\r\nSerpent that Moses set up in the wilderness. A striking banner is that\r\nby Bonfigli, in the church of S. Fiorenzo at Perugia, painted in A.D.\r\n1476 during an epidemic of plague. Above kneels the Madonna: before\r\nher stands the Child in a basket of roses upheld by angels, wearing\r\nchaplets of roses, as in most of Bonfigli’s pictures. Both Madonna and\r\nChild are crowned. Below kneel groups of citizens, men and women, with\r\nSebastian and other saints, supplicating the Madonna. An angel holds a\r\nscroll, on which is inscribed a fervid call to repentance, blended with\r\nfierce denunciation of their sins, in these words of Lorenzo Spiriti:\r\n\r\n      ‘Oh, most obstinate and wicked people—cruel, proud,\r\n    and full of all iniquity, who have placed your faith\r\n    and your desires on things, which are full of a mortal\r\n    misery, I, the angel of Heaven, am sent unto you from\r\n    God to tell you, that He will put an end to all your\r\n    wounds and weeping, your ruin and your curse through\r\n    the mediation of Mary.... Turn, turn your eyes, most\r\n    miserable mortals, to the great examples of the past\r\n    and present, to the utter miseries and heavy evils,\r\n    which Heaven sends to you because of all your sins:\r\n    your homicide and your adultery, your avarice and\r\n    luxury.... Oh miserable beings, the justice of heaven\r\n    works not in a hurry, but it punishes always, even\r\n    as men deserve.... Nineveh was a city florid and\r\n    magnificent, and Babylon was likewise, but now they\r\n    are as nothing: and Sodom and Gomorrah, behold them\r\n    now—a morass of sulphur and of fetid waters.... Oh,\r\n    therefore, be grateful and acknowledge the benefits\r\n    and graces of our Saviour, and let your souls burn\r\n    hotly with the fire of faith and charity, of hope and\r\n    faithful love.... But and if you should again grow\r\n    slothful and unwilling to renounce your errors, I\r\n    foretell a second judgement upon you, and I reckon\r\n    that it will prove more terrible, more cruel than the\r\n    first.’[163]\r\n\r\nIn banners such as this the imagination of the painter finds play for\r\nthe crowding emotions not of his own heart only, but of the hearts of\r\nhis fellow citizens as well.\r\n\r\nAnother type of plague banner is that of the ‘Madonna della\r\nMisericordia’ in the church of S. Francesco del Prato at Perugia,\r\nalso by Bonfigli. It bears the date A.D. 1464. In the centre stands\r\nthe crowned Madonna, a majestic figure erect like a lighthouse amid\r\nthe storm, on which sufferers may fix their eyes and hope. On her\r\ngarment lie broken arrows, while beneath its ample folds kneel groups\r\nof monks on one side, and of nuns on the other, all in attitudes of\r\nprayer. In the upper part of the picture Christ, wearing both crown\r\nand cruciferous nimbus, casts arrows down. At His right hand is the\r\nangel of justice with sword drawn, at His left the angel of mercy\r\nwith sheathed sword. Gathered around the Madonna and craving her\r\nintercession are S. Lorenzo and the Bishop SS. Severo, Costanzo, and\r\nLudovico. Beneath these to the right SS. Francis and Bernardino, and to\r\nthe left S. Peter Martyr and S. Sebastian, whose body is pierced with\r\nmany arrows. These saints have Perugia in their special keeping. At the\r\nfoot of the picture is shown the city of Perugia, with its emblematic\r\ngriffin on the wall. Within the walls a white-robed confraternity is\r\nkneeling in prayer. Without them lurks Death, a bat-winged skeleton\r\nwith bow and arrows, whose victims strew the ground. But the prayers\r\nhave prevailed, and already the archangel Raphael strikes Death with\r\nhis spear. In the foreground outside the walls is a fugitive family,\r\nthe mother mounted on a donkey, carrying her infants in its paniers. At\r\na side gate two soldiers make off in haste, as the porter tells them\r\nthe state of the city. Perugians say that not Bonfigli but an angel\r\npainted the face of the Madonna. They might well have said it of the\r\nexquisite ‘Madonna del Soccorso’ in Sinibaldo Ibi’s plague banner of\r\nA.D. 1482 in the church of S. Francisco at Montone. This fancy of the\r\nprotecting Madonna, spreading her robes over her suppliants, as a hen\r\ngathers her chickens under her wings, is borrowed from Hebrew poetry.\r\nIt figures in a similar conception in the language of the ninety-first\r\nPsalm: ‘I will say unto the Lord, Thou art my hope and my stronghold:\r\nmy God, in Him will I trust. For He shall deliver thee from the snare\r\nof the hunter, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall defend thee\r\nunder His wings, and thou shalt be safe under His feathers.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV (Face Page 138)\r\n\r\nMADONNA DELLA MISERICORDIA BY BONFIGLI\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Alinari, Rome]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV (Face Page 138)\r\n\r\nMADONNA DEL SOCCORSO. BY SINIBALDO IBI\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Alinari, Rome]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI (Face Page 139)\r\n\r\nPLAGUE BANNER. CHRIST AND SAINTS. BY BONFIGLI\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Anderson, Rome]\r\n\r\nOne more Madonna banner calls for passing notice—that of Bonfigli at\r\nCorciano near Perugia, dated 1472. It has the same general character as\r\nhis ‘Madonna della Misericordia’. The quaint head-gear of the angels\r\nsupporting her robe is the rose-wreath, symbolic of the Madonna, which\r\nappears, in one form or another, in so many of her pictures.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all these banners, as in other archaic works, the dwindling\r\nsize of individual figures indicates the lesser parts they have to\r\nplay. In many the Madonna fills almost all the banner’s surface.\r\n\r\nIn another of Bonfigli’s banners in the church of S. Maria Nuova at\r\nPerugia the figure of Christ, wearing a cruciferous nimbus, dominates\r\nthe picture. He holds the arrows of pestilence ready to be launched\r\namong the people. His face is sad and regretful, as He executes\r\nfaithfully the behests of His Father. On either side of Him saints\r\nbear the emblems of the Passion, and to the right and left are the\r\ndarkened sun and moon. Beside Him kneel the Madonna and the Franciscan\r\nS. Paulinus. In the lowest part of the picture are the chimneys and\r\ntowers of Perugia, with the pest-fiend, in the semblance of a huge\r\nbat, bearing a scythe, and the Angel of Deliverance smiting him with\r\nhis lance. Below, shepherded by S. Benedict and S. Scholastica, the\r\ndiminutive citizens kneel in prayer.\r\n\r\nYet another type of plague banner is that in which the figure of a\r\nsaint plays the leading rôle. The saint is always Sebastian, only\r\nbecause in Umbria and Tuscany he was the chief accredited protector\r\nagainst pestilence. The finest example of this type is the S. Sebastian\r\nof Sodoma, described above (pp. 100-1).\r\n\r\nPlague banners were not the exclusive product of Umbria. Two of the\r\nmost famous, the S. Sebastian of Sodoma and the Sistine Madonna of\r\nRaphael, painted at Siena and Florence respectively, are products of\r\nthe Tuscan school: but it is only in and around Perugia that they can\r\nbe found and studied to advantage. The Sistine Madonna, in which the\r\nMadonna and Child are attended by S. Sixtus and S. Barbara, was painted\r\nduring an epidemic of pestilence for the Black Brothers of S. Sisto\r\nat Piacenza. No record exists that it was ever actually used for the\r\npurpose for which it was painted. Bonfigli, in the spirit of Phidias,\r\nhad painted ‘Mary the Queen of Heaven’: Raphael, in the spirit of\r\nPraxiteles, had painted ‘Mary the Mother of God’. The people wanted a\r\nqueen and Raphael gave them a peasant woman. They could not see, as\r\nRaphael saw, in womanhood the embodiment of gentleness spiritualizing\r\nthe brute in man. They could not see in motherhood the vision of\r\nwilling suffering transfigured to joy. It was this reunion of Art with\r\nNature, that dethroned the plague banner from the affections of the\r\ncommon people.\r\n\r\nPlague banners of less importance are those by Bonfigli at Civitella\r\nBenazzone, by Sinibaldo Ibi in the convent of S. Ubaldo at Gubbio,\r\ndated A.D. 1503, by Giannicola Manni in the church of S. Dominico\r\nat Perugia, dated A.D. 1525, and by Berto di Giovanni in Perugia\r\nCathedral, dated A.D. 1526. There they will be seen for the most part\r\nas framed altar-pieces.\r\n\r\nPerugia’s greatest painter, Pietro Vannucci, better known as Perugino,\r\nperished in the course of one of his city’s plagues. Tradition has it\r\nthat he died denying the Saviour and Madonna, whom his art had done\r\nso much to glorify, and that his body was thrown into a desolate\r\ngrave beside a wayside oak. His sons searched diligently for their\r\nfather’s body, to lay it in the church of S. Agostino, but in vain,\r\namong so many that had perished of the plague. It is, said, however,\r\nthat a priest found it and buried it under the walls of his church at\r\nFontignano.\r\n\r\nThe humbler _Pestblätter_ seem to have played much the same part in\r\nthe devotional activities of the individual as did the _gonfaloni_ in\r\nthose of the multitude. They were not exclusively German, but were\r\nissued also from the presses of Flanders, the Netherlands, Italy, and\r\nmore rarely of France as well. Pictorial _Pestblätter_ are mostly rough\r\nwoodcuts or copper-plate engravings, crudely coloured by hand in some\r\ncases, and belong chiefly to the last two-thirds of the fifteenth and\r\nthe first third of the sixteenth centuries. In the character of their\r\nsubjects they are usually simply devotional, and represent some act of\r\nexpiation or intercession on behalf of mankind. The three leading types\r\ncorrespond closely to the three types of _gonfaloni_ in their subjects:\r\n\r\n    1. Christ, the suffering Redeemer, on the cross.\r\n    2. Intercession by the Virgin Mary or by Christ.\r\n    3. Memorials of the martyrdom of special plague saints,\r\n       such as St. Sebastian, St. Roch, and St. Antony.\r\n\r\nAnd closely allied to this last,\r\n\r\n    4. Intercession by these special plague saints, or by\r\n       other saints whose association with plague was more\r\n       fortuitous and less widely recognized: such were\r\n       St. Quirinus, St. Adrian, and St. Valentine.\r\n\r\nMany of these forms have attached to them some appropriate prayer or\r\ninvocation. Sometimes the religious element is supplemented by an\r\nexposition of hygienic precautions or of remedial measures. Thus a\r\ndevotional cut comes to be blended with injunctions, usually in verse,\r\nas to how to stave off pestilence by isolation, fumigation, washing,\r\nor dietary; or how to cure it by such measures as bleeding, or\r\nplasters to hasten maturation of the buboes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these types, a non-pictorial type is met with, nearly\r\nakin to the English Broadside, in which the religious purpose has\r\nalmost or wholly disappeared, and which sets out in uncompromising\r\nprose directions of prophylactic or therapeutic character.\r\n\r\n_Pestblätter_ originated in more ways than one. In times of pestilence\r\npilgrimages were often made to the shrines of special saints, and rough\r\nrepresentations of these saints were provided, as memorials of their\r\npilgrimage to the devout. Sometimes the object of homage was some\r\nsacred picture, which would then be roughly reproduced as a memento.\r\nAt other times they seem to have been issued by religious communities\r\nfor purely devotional purposes. Those of secular character were either\r\nprinted by order of the municipalities, or were the product of private\r\nmedical enterprise. Original _Pestblätter_ are to be seen in the\r\nleading museums of most European countries. A selection of these has\r\nbeen admirably reproduced in a portfolio[164] by Heitz and Mündel of\r\nStrasbourg.\r\n\r\nPlate XVII (1) is a woodcut, probably printed at Nuremberg at the\r\ncommencement of the fifteenth century. The Almighty is depicted with\r\nthe drawn sword of pestilence in His hand, within what would seem\r\nfrom its colouring in the original to be a representation of the\r\nrose-wreath, emblematic of the Virgin Mary. In the centre are St.\r\nSebastian with his symbolic arrow, and an angel tending the plague sore\r\nof St. Roch. Below is a prayer to these two saints.\r\n\r\nPlate XVII (2) shows the Almighty above, with the shafts of pestilence\r\nin His hands. The crowned Madonna shelters beneath her robe her\r\nsuppliants, among whom are dignitaries of the Church. Below a group\r\nof saints are interceding with the Virgin and Child and St. Anna. The\r\nwhole is encircled by the Virgin’s girdle wrought into a rose-wreath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII (Between Pages 142 and 143)\r\n\r\n1. THE ALMIGHTY WITH SS. SEBASTIAN AND ROCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII (Between Pages 142 and 143)\r\n\r\n2. THE ALMIGHTY, MADONNA AND SUPPLIANTS. THE VIRGIN AND CHILD, S. ANNA\r\nAND SUPPLIANTS]\r\n\r\nSt. Anthony is a favourite figure of these _Pestblätter_. He is more\r\nclosely associated with plague and pestilence in Germany than is the\r\ncase in Italy. He is also patron saint against erysipelas, known as St.\r\nAnthony’s Fire, which often raged in epidemics in pre-Listerian times.\r\nHe is commonly represented with the cross, on which he was crucified,\r\nwith a crutch symbolic of his great age and feebleness, and with an\r\nexorcising bell. The passing bell was tolled originally not only to\r\nask for prayers for the soul of the departed, but also to scare away\r\nevil spirits from it. The pig, that accompanies St. Anthony, is the\r\nemblem of the Devil, whose temptings he successfully repelled. Even\r\nin the absence of St. Anthony himself, his cross in the form of the\r\nGreek T is often introduced, sometimes with Christ nailed upon it. From\r\nthis association of St. Anthony with the cross, it became customary to\r\nappeal to him, as to the crucifix, in times of pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe association of SS. Quirinus, Adrian, and Valentine of Rufach with\r\nplague is purely local and incidental. St. Quirinus was primarily the\r\npatron saint of the gouty, and St. Valentine of the epileptic, so\r\nthat the name _Veltins Krankheit_ was applied to epilepsy. St. Adrian\r\nheld under his special protection the Flemish brewers, and the more\r\ncreditable patronage of the plague-stricken was only a later accretion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA very large number of pictures are designed to commemorate specific\r\nplagues, and were painted in fulfilment of vows made to the Madonna and\r\nsaints for deliverance from plague. Many of these have already been\r\nconsidered in connexion with the legends and cults of SS. Sebastian and\r\nRoch, to whom they were dedicated. But in far the larger proportion of\r\nthese pictures the central figure is the Madonna (see Plates XI and\r\nXII). Sometimes she is attended by SS. Sebastian and Roch, and by other\r\nsaints as well. The added saints are, as a rule, the special protectors\r\nof the city, for which the thank-offering has been vowed. Sometimes\r\nthey are the patron saints of confraternities, for whom they have been\r\npainted. Sometimes the special medical saints, Cosmas and Damian, are\r\nappropriately added to the pictures. Examples may be seen in almost any\r\ngallery of Italian pictures. In the Brera, Cima de Conigliano (A.D.\r\n1460-1518) has painted the Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist,\r\nSt. Sebastian, the Magdalen and St. Roch, the last-named showing an\r\nincised wound on the inner side of the right thigh. The character of\r\nthe picture may be taken as conclusive evidence of its origin and\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nTitian’s picture in the Vatican shows the Madonna and Child in glory,\r\nand St. Sebastian, St. Nicholas, St. Catharine, St. Peter, and St.\r\nFrancis are the attendant saints. This picture was painted by Titian\r\nafter the cessation of a plague epidemic at Venice for the Franciscan\r\nchurch of S. Nicolò de Frari.\r\n\r\nCorreggio’s ‘Madonna di San Sebastiano’, in which she is attended by\r\nSS. Sebastian and Roch, with S. Geminiano, the patron saint of Modena,\r\nwas painted in A.D. 1515 in commemoration of a plague that devastated\r\nthat city three years previously.\r\n\r\nYet another by Guido Reni (A.D. 1574-1642), in the Academy at Bologna,\r\nwas painted at the instance of the senate of Bologna, after the plague\r\nof A.D. 1630. It was carried in solemn procession through the city\r\nto its consecration, and from this circumstance has been called ‘Il\r\nPallione del Voto’. The rainbow beneath the Madonna’s feet, and the\r\nolive branch in the hand of the infant Christ, each signify the return\r\nof peace. The attendant saints are the special protectors of Bologna,\r\nSt. Petronius, St. Francis, St. Dominic, St. Proculus, St. Florian, St.\r\nIgnatius and St. Francis Xavier.\r\n\r\nRaphael’s ‘Madonna of Foligno’, in the Vatican, has been accounted by\r\nsome a plague picture on account of its general character, and of the\r\nfireball descending on the city of Foligno. Raphael, however, painted\r\nthe picture in A.D. 1512, the very year in which it is recorded that\r\nan aerolite fell into Foligno: the picture probably commemorates the\r\nescape of some individual or institution. There was a disastrous plague\r\nin Foligno, but not till A.D. 1523, and it has been depicted in a\r\nhideous picture by Gaetano Gandolfi of Bologna (A.D. 1734-1802), which\r\nis now in the Corsini Palace at Rome.\r\n\r\nMiraculous Madonnas abound in Italy, but are, as a rule, of little\r\nartistic interest. A pleasing exception is the ‘Madonna and Child’ that\r\nhangs in the tribune of the church of Carmine in Perugia. It was put up\r\nto commemorate the deliverance of Perugia from plague at the prayer of\r\nthe Perugian Carmelites: at each recurrence of plague it was the object\r\nof popular adoration. Formerly it was covered with a gauze veil, which\r\ncaught fire and was destroyed, but the Madonna herself escaped any\r\ntrace of injury.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna of Ara Coeli and the Madonna of S. Maria Maggiore are both\r\naccredited deliverers from plague and pestilence in Rome.\r\n\r\nFlorence, too, has her miraculous Madonna in the small village of\r\nImpruneta. This dark panel, blackened and perished with the lapse\r\nof years, was found, so the legend goes, in the soil at Impruneta,\r\nuttering a cry as the workman’s spade struck it. Seldom or never\r\nexposed to the gaze of the devout, she has suffered the indignity of\r\nan exposure at the hands of the omnipresent photographer. In A.D.\r\n1527 plague broke out in Florence in the early summer. On June 2,\r\nan enormous festival was celebrated in honour of the Virgin of the\r\nAnnunciation, that she might be persuaded to succour the Commonwealth\r\nin its troubles. But in July and August the mortality rose to 150-200\r\na day, and in the autumn to twice these numbers, so that all business\r\nwas at a standstill, and the city seemed deserted. Then the government\r\ndetermined to have recourse to the Black Virgin of Impruneta, whom the\r\nCommonwealth of Florence has invoked so often in various crises of its\r\nhistory. Of her Segni[165] says: ‘To this mother of God our city has\r\nnever publicly applied in vain, in whatever extremity of distress. It\r\nis no light or silly thing, which I am here affirming: for in time of\r\ndrought she ever sent rain: in periods of flood, she has restored to us\r\nfine weather: from pestilence she has removed the poison: and in every\r\nmost grievous ill she has found its appropriate remedy.’ So the Black\r\nVirgin was brought from Impruneta, and the magistrates of Florence,\r\n‘barefooted and in mourning, received her at the gate of the city, and\r\ncarried her in solemn and very sad procession to the Church of the\r\nServites. Forty thousand citizens had died in the month of November.\r\nBut the never-failing Virgin of Impruneta prevailed on this occasion\r\nalso. For with the coming of the cold weather, the sickness began to\r\nabate. And thus the faith of the Florentines in their charm was more\r\nthan ever confirmed.’ The Black Virgin still watches over Florence in\r\ntime of drought. Readers of _Romola_ will recall that other stirring\r\nprocession of the Impruneta Virgin, in which Savonarola strode along\r\ndefiantly among his company of black and white Dominicans.\r\n\r\nThroughout France and Italy numerous pictures may be seen, recording\r\nthe ministrations of local or locally venerated saints in time of\r\npestilence. Such is Tiepolo’s picture in the cathedral at Este, showing\r\nSt. Tecla liberating Este from plague. Pictures such as this stand\r\nmidway between the group of votive pictures and the group of actual\r\nplague scenes, of which Raphael (A.D. 1483-1520) is the earliest\r\nexponent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII (Face Page 146)\r\n\r\nTHE IMPRUNETA VIRGIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX S. TECLA LIBERATES ESTE FROM PLAGUE\r\n\r\nBy Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. Photograph by Naya, Venice (Face Page\r\n147)]\r\n\r\nRaphael’s drawing of ‘Plague’,[166] now in the Uffizi gallery at\r\nFlorence, has become much worn with time. The picture is divided into\r\ntwo parts by a head of the god Terminus mounted on a lofty pedestal.\r\nTo the right it is night-time, but the interior of a house of mourning\r\nis shown in vertical section. In its courtyard is a young man, with\r\na torch in his right hand, counting the number of stricken animals,\r\nwhile with his left he prevents one of the sheep from coming near to\r\nthose that are dead. An ewe lies dead with a young lamb fastened to her\r\ndried-up udder. An ox lying down surveys the scene sadly. Above this\r\ncorpse-strewn court a stream of light, penetrating into the interior\r\nof a room, illumines the figures of two Sisters of Charity, as they\r\nminister to the master of the house, who is dying: he is stretched on\r\nhis bed, lying in a dense shadow—the shadow of impending death. He\r\nseems to turn away from them and to reject their help.\r\n\r\nIn the other part of the picture it is day, and daylight shows\r\nup everywhere scenes of suffering, death, and desolation. In the\r\nforeground lies the body of a woman stretched out in death, while her\r\nchild struggles to reach her ice-cold breast. The father bends down\r\nhastily to hold the child away, and, as he does so, covers his nose\r\nand mouth with his hand, to keep out the contagion of the pestilence.\r\nBehind this group an older woman turns away in horror: before it, an\r\nold man buries his face in his hands against the plinth of the statue\r\nin an anguish of sorrow, while a young man makes off in panic. In\r\nthe background broken columns and the dead body of a horse serve to\r\nintensify the desolation of the scene.\r\n\r\nRaphael’s rendering of the scene, for all the horror of its details,\r\nserves rather to inspire pity than horror. He holds the balance evenly\r\nbetween the horrible realities of the plague and the redeeming\r\nspirituality of human nature. Compassion and suffering stand side by\r\nside. The ox pities his kind passively, as the Sisters seek to minister\r\nactively to their kind. In the features and attitude of the child\r\nRaphael has depicted the devotion that does not die with death. The\r\ndeepest note of pathos is touched in the form of the old man in the\r\ncentre of the picture, whose grey hairs are brought down in sorrow to\r\nthe grave.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that Raphael’s rendering of the dead mother and\r\nthe child was inspired by an actual record of Ambroise Paré, but as\r\nParé was only born three years before Raphael died, the statement falls\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nRaphael’s debt seems to go back as far as to Aristides of Thebes, who\r\nflourished about 340 B.C. Pliny[167] mentions a picture by him, which\r\nso impressed Alexander the Great, at the sack of Thebes, that he took\r\nit for himself, and ordered that it should be sent to Pella. According\r\nto Pliny, the picture represented a wounded mother lying at the point\r\nof death, and her infant child creeping to her breast. Fear is written\r\nin the expression of her face, lest the child should draw blood from\r\nher breast, now that her milk is dry.\r\n\r\nRaphael’s drawing has been engraved by Marco Antonio Raimondi under\r\nthe name of ‘Il Morbetto’. In Delaborde’s _Marc-Antoine Raimondi_ it\r\nis reproduced under the name ‘La Peste de Phrygie’, because on the\r\npedestal are inscribed the words of Vergil:\r\n\r\n    Linquebant dulces animas aut aegra trahebant\r\n    corpora.[168]\r\n\r\nVergil, in this brief description of pestilence, aims at no more than\r\nmere poetic effect. It is introduced only to fill up the cup of trouble\r\nfor the Trojan wanderers, and is compressed into a few lines. The\r\nTrojan fleet had just made the land: Aeneas had laid the foundations of\r\na new town, and Ilium was to live again in Pergamus. Then the plague\r\nbroke out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX PLAGUE. A DRAWING BY RAPHAEL (Face Page 148)]\r\n\r\n    Iamque fere sicco subductae littore puppes;\r\n    Connubiis arvisque novis operata iuventus,\r\n    .. .. .. .. subito cum tabida membris,\r\n    corrupto caeli tractu, miserandaque venit\r\n    arboribusque satisque lues et letifer annus.\r\n    linquebant dulces animas aut aegra trahebant\r\n    corpora; tum steriles exurere Sirius agros;\r\n    arebant herbae, et victum seges aegra negabat.\r\n\r\n    Scarce stand the vessels hauled upon the beach,\r\n    And bent on marriages the young men vie\r\n    To till new settlements, while I to each\r\n    Due law dispense and dwelling place supply.\r\n    When from a tainted quarter of the sky\r\n    Rank vapours, gathering, on my comrades seize,\r\n    And a foul pestilence creeps down from high\r\n    On mortal limbs and standing crops and trees,\r\n    A season black with death, and pregnant with disease.\r\n\r\n    Sweet life from mortals fled: they drooped and died.\r\n    Fierce Sirius scorched the fields, and herbs and grain\r\n    Were parched, and food the wasting crops denied.\r\n                                 (FAIRFAX TAYLOR.)\r\n\r\nAs it stands, this is an outline sketch of a famine-pestilence, which\r\nRaphael had no intention of depicting, when he adopted the line. Surely\r\nSisters of Charity would not figure in a Phrygian plague, some thousand\r\nyears before Christ!\r\n\r\nBesides pictures, a few medals exist commemorative of plagues prior\r\nto the sixteenth century: these were sometimes struck as mediums of\r\nspiritual consolation. Frequent devices on these were representations\r\nof Christ on the Cross, or of a Serpent on a pole. The specimen figured\r\nhere (Plate I (4)) is a Wittenberg thaler of 1528. It shows these two\r\ndevices on the opposite faces of the medal, each with a descriptive\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century had drawn to a close in Italy amid a confusion\r\nof epidemics. Pintor, the personal physician of Pope Alexander VI,\r\nhas left a book in which he says that the _morbus Gallicus_ first\r\nappeared at Rome in March 1493 and had claimed numerous victims by the\r\nAugust following. Then, after an inundation of the Tiber in December\r\n1495, plague broke out fiercely in Rome. Pintor states that the touch\r\nof certain precious stones was vaunted as a specific. In 1493 plague\r\nwas raging also at Genoa and Naples. At the latter city the mortality\r\namounted to 20,000 souls. A Genoese chronicler, Seneraga, attributes\r\nthe outbreak at Genoa to pollution of the shore by the dead bodies\r\nof the Jews, who had sought sanctuary there on their expulsion from\r\nSpain in 1492, but had died of starvation on the outskirts of the\r\ninhospitable city. Jewish writers asserted that there was plague in\r\nSpain, and that it was carried by the fugitives in their ships to\r\nItaly. Most of the expelled Jews found shelter from the persecution\r\nof the Cross under the protection of the Crescent, in Constantinople,\r\nSalonica, the Levant, and Northern Africa. It was this far-reaching\r\nepidemic that drove Charles VIII of France out of Florence, Rome, and\r\nNaples in succession, almost as soon as his army had entered them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] Ode 4.\r\n\r\n[159] Bk.

In Rome alone,\r\nduring this century, there were no less than twelve severe outbreaks.\r\nThe archives of the Capitol and the registers of contemporary\r\nnotaries[169] abound in scattered information concerning these\r\nvisitations. It had become an established custom that at the first\r\nappearance of an epidemic the Pope and his court should escape from\r\nRome to a place of safety, leaving the municipality to provide for\r\nthe situation as best it could. In May 1449, Nicholas V had fled into\r\nUmbria: in 1462, Pius II had fled successively to Viterbo, Bolsena, and\r\nCorsignano. In 1476, Sixtus IV had flitted in like manner from place to\r\nplace. So in April 1522, at the height of the epidemic, it seemed only\r\nin accordance with precedent, when Adrian VI from his secure seclusion\r\nin Spain sent word to Rome of the necessity of imposing a fresh tax\r\nfor supporting a crusade against the Turks. The Cardinals seem to have\r\ndesired to emulate the example of Adrian, for in June the Town Council\r\nasked the Sacred College not to forsake their posts. Deserted by their\r\nspiritual leaders, the populace lent a ready ear to the imposture of\r\nthe Greek necromancer Demetrius of Sparta. He persuaded the terrified\r\npeople that the plague was the work of demons, and that, by appeasing\r\nthem, it might be brought to an end. So he paraded the streets of the\r\ncity, leading by a silken cord a bull that he professed to have tamed\r\nby spells, and sacrificed it in the Colosseum with full pagan ritual to\r\nthe hostile demons. As soon as the clergy realized the enormity of the\r\nsacrilege they had condoned they instituted a penitential procession,\r\nwhich marched through the city, scourging themselves to bleeding and\r\ncrying _Misericordia_. If we may credit Paolo Giovio, chief physician\r\nto Clement VII (A.D. 1523-34), it was neither prayer nor sacrifice that\r\nput an end to the plague, but a wonderful oil invented by Gregorio\r\nCaravita, a physician from Bologna. The Oratorio del Crocifisso, near\r\nthe church of S. Marcello, is said to have been erected in expiation of\r\nthis event. This plague lingered on at least till the following year,\r\nA.D. 1523, for Benvenuto Cellini[170] records his experience of it in\r\nsome detail. He says that it dragged on for months, and that several\r\nthousands died daily in Rome. In not unnatural apprehension on his\r\nown account, he determined to adopt such amusements as would promote\r\ncheerfulness of mind, which many believed to be the best remedy against\r\ninfection. So he betook himself to shooting pigeons among the ancient\r\nmonuments of Rome, and found the pursuit so beneficial to his health\r\nthat he succeeded in staving off for a long time the plague, to which\r\nmany of his comrades succumbed. But somewhat later, after spending\r\nthe night with a young serving girl, he himself fell a victim and has\r\nrecorded his initial sensations as follows:\r\n\r\n      ‘I rose upon the hour of breaking fast, and felt\r\n    tired, for I had travelled many miles that night, and\r\n    was wanting to take food, when a crushing headache\r\n    seized me: several boils appeared upon my left arm,\r\n    together with a carbuncle which showed itself just\r\n    beyond the palm of the left hand, where it joins the\r\n    wrist. Everybody in the house was in a panic: my\r\n    friend, the cow [Faustina] and the calf [the serving\r\n    girl] all fled. Left alone there with my poor little\r\n    prentice, who refused to abandon me, I felt stifled at\r\n    the heart, and made up my mind for certain I was a dead\r\n    man.’\r\n\r\nBy the constant ministrations of a male friend and the help of a\r\nphysician, whom the apprentice summoned, Benvenuto threw off the\r\nsickness, but while the bubo was still open and plugged with lint\r\nunder a covering of plaster, went out riding on a little wild pony.\r\nBenvenuto’s account is valuable as the record of the personal\r\nsensations and sufferings of a plague-stricken man, and tells us also\r\nsomething of the treatment to which he was subjected at the hands of\r\nsixteenth-century medicine.\r\n\r\nBenvenuto says that the joyous reunion of the survivors, after\r\nthe plague was over, led to the formation by one Michael Agnolo,\r\na sculptor, of a club of all the leading painters, sculptors, and\r\ngoldsmiths in Rome. The meetings of the club, to judge from his\r\ndescriptions, seem to have been devoted to merrymaking rather than to\r\nartistic discourse. On his return to Florence he found that his father\r\nand most of his household were dead, and his surviving sister Liparata,\r\nbelieving him to have died at Rome, swooned at sight of him. But under\r\nthe mellowing influence of supper, at which weddings were the main\r\ntopic of conversation, sorrow speedily gave place to gaiety.\r\n\r\nMarselius Galeati of Padua at the beginning of the fifteenth century\r\nhad drawn up the first known code of ‘Regulations against the Plague’,\r\nbased on the belief that the disease was imported to Italy by foreign\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nFrom the records of the city of Rome it is possible to gather some\r\nidea of the measures adopted by the Popes and Town Council for the\r\nsuppression of epidemics of plague. There isolation of infected\r\nindividuals or districts was attempted. All wearing apparel and other\r\nmaterials and articles capable of spreading the infection, were\r\nliable to be destroyed. The city gates were closed, and every incomer\r\nwas subjected to strict inspection, and was frequently rejected.\r\nThose gates that were left open could only be used from daybreak to\r\nnightfall, when they were locked against all comers. Navigation of the\r\nTiber was sometimes suppressed; Lanciani says that an order was issued\r\non July 30, 1575, that all the boats on the Tiber should be scuttled\r\nin three days, because it was found that the boatmen were ferrying\r\npassengers across stream for bribes. Two transgressors were actually\r\nput to the rack for their offence, which was placarded over them for\r\nall to read. On one occasion a wholesale destruction of dried fish was\r\ntaken in hand. Contract medical practice seems to have existed even\r\nin these days. Lanciani has noted among the city records agreements\r\nbetween physicians or quacks and Roman families for the provision of\r\nmedical advice and drugs for a stipulated payment of money. Wills were\r\noften dictated from windows, while lawyer and witnesses stood in the\r\nstreet beneath.\r\n\r\nConfraternities for ministering to the sick and removing them to the\r\nhospitals existed in Rome, though perhaps numerically less than in\r\nother great cities of Italy. The confraternity of the _Pietà_ had\r\nbeen instituted during a plague epidemic, in the time of Eugene IV\r\n(1431-47), and still has a nominal existence in Rome.\r\n\r\nPlague broke out fiercely again in Rome in 1527, at the time of the\r\nsack of the city. Florence was also involved in this same epidemic. It\r\nis this visitation that gave birth to Machiavelli’s _Descrizione della\r\nPeste di Firenze dell’ anno 1527_, cast in the form of a letter to a\r\nfriend. In it we find no vivid picture of the awful catastrophe that\r\nwas overwhelming Florence, but in place of that a cold-blooded cynical\r\nrecord of the trivial doings of a loafer sauntering idly through the\r\nstreets of the plague-stricken city. It is a record that challenges\r\ncomparison rather with the casual entries of _Pepys’s Diary_, than with\r\nthe formal descriptions of Bocaccio and Manzoni, his own compatriots.\r\nOpening with a vapid soulless lamentation, in the vein of Petrarch,\r\nover the general demoralization and devastation produced by the plague,\r\nhe passes on to describe his own daily mode of living, from which his\r\ncorrespondent is invited to infer that of the general body of citizens.\r\nThe _liaisons_ of licentious monks, the vile ribaldry of infamous\r\nburiers, the vain recourse to preservatives against the plague, these\r\nare the things that are uppermost in his mind, as he depicts his own\r\namorous intrigues against the dark background of the plague, with the\r\nfidelity of a Pepys and the light-hearted insouciance of a Guy de\r\nMaupassant.\r\n\r\nVillari, Macaulay, and others have declined to accept the _Descrizione_\r\nas an authentic product of Machiavelli’s pen. They cannot reconcile its\r\ngarrulous obscenity with the stern cold-blooded restraint of the author\r\nof the _Principe_—the frivolity of the one with the sinewy manhood\r\nof the other. They seem to forget that, so far back as 1502, amid\r\nthe stirring life of the camp of Caesar Borgia, he had found leisure\r\nto write similar puerilities to his friends in Florence. Political\r\nrectitude, or if we may not ascribe this to Machiavelli, political\r\nsagacity is no guarantee of moral righteousness, and sensuality is\r\nnot the exclusive property of the young. Moral levity, as the history\r\nof pestilence shows, is a usual product of the constant imminence of\r\ndanger and death; and with Machiavelli political degradation had left\r\nmoral levity in sole possession of the field.\r\n\r\nA copy of the discredited production still actually exists in the\r\nhandwriting of Machiavelli, with revisions inserted in the manuscript\r\nin that of his friend Lorenzo di Filippo Strozzi. Villari advances the\r\nstrange suggestion, that Machiavelli had merely copied out what Strozzi\r\nhad composed. Is it not equally reasonable to suppose that Machiavelli\r\nhad used an actual letter of Strozzi, as the basis of a casual\r\ncomposition? This would explain the fact that it is cast in epistolary\r\nform, as well as the apparent discrepancy of style. Francesco Berni\r\n(_c._ 1490-1536), a contemporary of Machiavelli, has apostrophized\r\nplague in one of his satirical poems or _capitoli_. A cleric, to whom\r\nindolent pleasure was the be-all and end-all of existence, he must\r\nsurely stand alone among writers as one who would hug the pestilence to\r\nhim as a friend.\r\n\r\n      ‘The pestilence time is good—a fig for other\r\n    times.... Firstly, it carries off the rabble, it\r\n    destroys them, makes holes among them and thins them\r\n    out—like a housewife among the geese at Allhallowtide!\r\n    In the churches there are none to press upon you.\r\n    Besides, none keep any record of buying or borrowing.\r\n    Yea, buy and make debts, for there will be no creditors\r\n    to trouble you. And if a creditor should come, tell him\r\n    that your head aches, that your arm pricks, he straight\r\n    will go away, and will not turn him round! If you go\r\n    out, no one will cross your path: rather is place\r\n    yielded to you, and honour done you, especially if you\r\n    are clothed in rags. You are lord of yourself and lord\r\n    of others. You can watch the folk’s strange antics and\r\n    laugh at others’ fear. Life has then new laws: every\r\n    pleasure is allowed.... Above all, there need be no\r\n    work done. It is a choice life, serene and large: time\r\n    passes very gaily from dinner time to supper.’[171]\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1530 there was plague in Geneva,[172] which is memorable as\r\nthe occasion of an accusation against certain persons of disseminating\r\nthe disease by means of concocted poisons. In the spring of the year\r\na dissolute young man, one Michael Caddod, was seen to throw down a\r\nhandkerchief near a shop. Some one picked it up, and its foul smell\r\naroused suspicion. Caddod was forthwith put to torture, and in his\r\nagony implicated Jean Placet, an unqualified surgeon in charge of\r\nthe pest-house, together with his wife, son, and servant, and one\r\nDom Jehan Dufour, priest and confessor to the pest-house. Under the\r\ninfluence of torture, they were driven to admit, that they had sworn\r\nsolemnly on a Book of Hours to join in spreading the plague, so as to\r\nenable them to pillage the sick. Placet and his wife, they said, had\r\nprepared the poison from poultices that had been used on discharging\r\nbuboes, by drying them to powder and then adding veratrum. Caddod and\r\nhis wife undertook to spread it about the streets, while Placet and\r\nhis wife administered it to patients in the pest-house with promptly\r\nfatal results. Suspicion fell on Placet, and a barber-surgeon, Bastian\r\nGranger, with his assistant, was instructed to keep an eye on his\r\ndoings. Madame Placet was equal to the occasion and gave the pair\r\nshort shrift with a dose of poison in their food. In the end Placet\r\nand Caddod were convicted. Their hands were first cut off in front of\r\nthe houses of their supposed victims. Next their flesh was cruelly\r\nlacerated with red-hot pincers, and finally the headsman’s axe put a\r\nmerciful end to their sufferings. Young Placet’s age obtained for him\r\nthe lenient treatment of hanging, while Dufour was first unfrocked and\r\nthen hanged. A rapid decline of the plague ensued on so acceptable a\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nA few years later, in January 1545, a recurrence of plague in Geneva\r\nraised anew the phantom of another plague plot. This time the bailiff\r\nordered the arrest of the two men, Bernard Dallinge and Jehan Lentille.\r\nThey were alleged to have cut off the foot of a corpse that had fallen\r\nfrom the gallows, and used it as an ingredient of a plague ointment\r\nthat they smeared on the handles of doors. By March, confessions\r\nextracted from them by torture had served to implicate no less than\r\nforty persons. All were accused of having sworn to spread the disease\r\nbroadcast, and of having actually smeared door-handles and locks. When\r\nsearched, boxes of ointment were found in their possession. The craze\r\nfor carrying antipestilential remedies made this an easy matter, but\r\nfor all that their guilt was manifest. Calvin, in a letter of March 27,\r\n1545, addressed to Myconius, seems to credit their guilt, but the State\r\nrecords of Geneva show that he mercifully advocated strangling instead\r\nof mutilation and the stake. As in the case of Servetus, he was less\r\nconcerned about their deaths than the manner of their dying. Nineteen\r\nmen and seven women—Catholics perhaps—profited by his clemency, and\r\nwere executed without preliminary torture. The _Nuremberg Chronicle_\r\nsays that in 1494 all the beggars were driven out of Nuremberg, because\r\nthey were believed to spread the plague.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of medicine were no more exempt than the people from the\r\npromptings of fanatical fear. Ambroise Paré[173] echoes the crude\r\nsuspicions that Guy de Chauliac had expressed at the time of the Black\r\nDeath. This is his advice to the magistrates in time of pestilence:\r\n‘What shall I add? They must keep an eye on certain thieves, murderers,\r\npoisoners, worse than inhuman, who grease and smear the walls and\r\ndoors of rich houses with matter from buboes and carbuncles and other\r\nexcretions of the plague-stricken, so as to infect the houses and\r\nthus be enabled to break into them, pillage and strip them, and even\r\nstrangle the poor sick in their beds: which was done at Lyons in the\r\nyear 1565. God! what punishment such fellows deserve: but this I leave\r\nto the discretion of the magistrates, who have charge of such duties.’\r\n\r\nParé recommended, as a prophylactic, the wearing of an amulet of\r\narsenic. It was to be worn over the heart in order that ‘the heart\r\nmight become accustomed to poison, and so be the less injured when\r\nother poisons sought it’.\r\n\r\nThe pandemic of A.D. 1565 was the occasion of a great impetus to the\r\nproduction of the so-called Mystery and Miracle plays, particularly in\r\nthe south-east parts of France. Mystery plays aimed for the most part\r\nat setting forth the central mysteries of the New Testament, such as\r\nthe Incarnation, the Nativity, the Passion, and the Redemption. Miracle\r\nplays dealt with the legends of the great saints of the Church, but\r\nin practice the distinction of Miracle and Mystery came to be ignored\r\nin the play. The purpose of each, in time of plague, was to appease\r\nan angered God by glorifying His majesty, either directly or through\r\nthe medium of His saints. The origin and prime purpose of these plays\r\nhad almost certainly been educational, for the instruction of a\r\npopulace unable to read for themselves: and they originated out of the\r\nworship of the Christian Church. Christianity, when adopted as the\r\nState religion, had dealt the death-blow to the vicious spectacles of\r\nthe amphitheatre that were all that survived of the ancient classical\r\ndrama. Christianity was also destined to become the parent of the\r\nmodern drama, by the introduction into public worship, not later than\r\nthe fifth century A.D., of living pictures to illustrate and expound\r\nits teaching. Mystery and Miracle plays alike were evolved from this\r\nsimple liturgical origin. The transformation had been effected at any\r\nrate as early as the twelfth century, and by A.D. 1380 a complete\r\nMiracle play was produced in the presence of Charles IV.\r\n\r\nSuccessive epidemics of plague had led to the adoption of these plays\r\nas instruments of intercession, and the pandemic of 1565 gave a great\r\nimpetus to this development. When the district of Maurienne was in\r\nthe grip of the plague in 1564, the people vowed to present in the\r\nfollowing year the Miracle play of their patron saint St. Martin,\r\nif only their town were spared. No less than seventy-four actors,\r\nall drawn from the working class, devoted themselves to learning and\r\nrehearsing the various parts of the play. Money as well as time was\r\nfreely afforded, for the people themselves undertook the expenses of\r\nstaging, scenery, and music. The marginal notes of the play, which has\r\nbeen recently published, show that the stage was erected beside the\r\nwall of a church. Later, as the control of the performances passed out\r\nof the hands of the Church into those of lay associations, the plays\r\ncame to be performed away from the churches, a separation that paved\r\nthe way for the secularization of the drama by the introduction of a\r\nnon-religious atmosphere. This play is in dialect and arranged for\r\npresentation on two days. At the first performance the central theme\r\nwas the life of St. Martin as a soldier, at the second his life as a\r\nbishop, and with it were shown certain of his miraculous cures.\r\n\r\nThis play is but one of many that have recently been published: other\r\ntowns followed the example of St. Martin de la Porte. Villard-le-Lans\r\nvowed and played the ‘Mystery of the Passion’ and the ‘Miracle of Saint\r\nSebastian’: Modane the ‘Mystery of the Last Judgement’: Termignan and\r\nSollières the ‘Miracle of Saint Laurence’, and so on. Local authors,\r\ncommonly the priest or the notary, compiled the various plays.\r\n\r\nAt Villard-le-Lans is a chapel of St. Sebastian. It has no windows, and\r\na doorway hewn in the rock. It was prepared as a theatre for presenting\r\na Mystery play in A.D. 1446. But following the plague of 1565 it was\r\nconverted, in fulfilment of a rich man’s vow, into a chapel adorned\r\nwith frescoes illustrating the story of St. Sebastian. The frescoes\r\nsurvive to this day, and have been fully described by M. l’Archiviste\r\nde Jussin.\r\n\r\nIf we may credit local legend, the Oberammergau Passion Play had\r\na similar origin in A.D. 1633. One Gaspard Schueler, a native of\r\nOberammergau, but living at Eschenlohe, where plague was rife,\r\ndetermined to pay a hasty and surreptitious visit to his wife and\r\nchildren. He did so, and carried the plague to Oberammergau, where he\r\ndied of it himself. Between the day of his death and the festival of\r\nSS. Simon and Jude, thirty-three days later, eighty-four persons died\r\nof plague at Oberammergau. A meeting of the inhabitants was summoned,\r\nand six women and twelve men took a solemn vow to produce every ten\r\nyears a play representing the sufferings of Christ. They were rewarded\r\nby the immediate cessation of the plague.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] Lanciani, _Golden Days of the Renaissance_.\r\n\r\n[170] Bk. I, § 27 seq.\r\n\r\n[171] Translated by Miss Egerton Castle, _Italian Literature_.\r\n\r\n[172] Léon Gautier, _La Médecine à Genève jusqu’à la fin du\r\ndix-huitième siècle_.\r\n\r\n[173] _Livre de la Peste._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the fourteenth and two succeeding centuries Venice was\r\nvisited by a constant succession of epidemics of plague. This was the\r\nprice she was doomed to pay for the enjoyment of her Oriental commerce.\r\nStanding, as she stood, at the meeting-place of east and west, so\r\nlong as the commerce of the east passed to the west by way of Syria\r\nand Egypt, Venice knew no rival but Genoa, until the Turk appeared\r\nat Constantinople to challenge her ascendancy. Plague and commerce\r\nalike passed through Venice on their way to the countries of Central\r\nand Northern Europe. Plague was in some sense the measure of Venetian\r\nopulence, and with the loss of this opulence the number of her plagues\r\ndeclined.\r\n\r\nVenice had two main trade routes by sea,[174] one to the east and one\r\nto the west, and two land routes to the north.\r\n\r\nThe first maritime route lay down the Adriatic, past the Ionian Isles,\r\nand round Cape Matapan to Crete, where it divided into four branch\r\nroutes: (_a_) northwards to the Dardanelles, Constantinople, the\r\nBlack Sea, and the Sea of Azov; (_b_) along the shores of the Morea\r\nand through the Aegean Islands to the Dardanelles; (_c_) to the ports\r\nof Asia Minor, Smyrna, and Aleppo, Cyprus, Syria, Alexandretta, and\r\nBeirut; (_d_) to Alexandria and Egypt. These two last branches linked\r\nVenice to the caravan routes that led from Ormuz on the Persian Gulf to\r\nAleppo and Beirut, and from Suez to Alexandria, and at their far end\r\npenetrated into the heart of Asia, Persia, India, and Cathay.\r\n\r\nThe second maritime route lay by way of the Adriatic westward to\r\nSicily, where it divided into two branch routes: (_a_) to Tunis,\r\nTripoli, and the ports of Spain; (_b_) through the Straits of Gibraltar\r\nnorthwards as far as England and Flanders, bringing London and Bruges\r\ninto touch with the east.\r\n\r\nThe land routes from Venice to Central Europe lay for the most part\r\noutside the confines of Venetian territory. One passed by way of the\r\nAmpezzo valley northward to the Pusterthal and on to Innsbruck and\r\nMunich; the other along the Po to Brescia and Bergamo, and thence by\r\nLake Como and the Splügen Pass to Constance. From Constance trade lines\r\ndiverged to all parts of Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of these routes is necessary to understand the leading part\r\nthat Venice and Constance played in the carriage and distribution of\r\nplague.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the Cape route to the east in 1486, was the death-blow\r\nto the trade monopoly of Venice. The lines of commerce shifted step by\r\nstep from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and away from the ships of\r\nVenice into those of the Portuguese, Spaniards, English, and Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe history of plague in Venice is in large part written in her\r\npublic monuments: her archives tell the rest. Venice has virtually\r\nno literature of her own: two or three patriotic diarists, and that\r\nis all. Her Renaissance gave birth to no harvest of men of letters:\r\npainting and architecture sapped all her strength. Artists vied with\r\narchitects to write her history on canvas or on stone, not for the\r\nenjoyment of private patrons, but for the embellishment of the city of\r\ntheir birth.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 1410 plague swept over Venice and Chioggia. In 1423 another\r\nepidemic was imported from the east. It was this visitation that led\r\nthe Venetians to establish a pest-house or lazaretto on the island of\r\nSanta Maria di Nazaret for infected persons and goods. It was supplied\r\nwith food, medicine, and medical attendance out of the revenue from\r\nsalt. This was the first institution of the kind in Europe, but it\r\nquickly led to the establishment of more elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Venice was never wont to fold its hands when plague\r\nwas at its door. So far back as the Black Death they had appointed\r\nthree nobles as _provveditori sopra la salute della terra_ to fight\r\nthe scourge. In 1468 these were supplemented by the addition of two\r\ninhabitants of each _sestiere_, and in 1485 this commission was\r\nreorganized as a permanent Board of Health. So by the end of the\r\nfifteenth century Venice had organized and equipped an efficient\r\ndefensive system against the constant recurrence of plague.\r\n\r\nA second lazaretto was established during the plague of 1576 on the\r\nisland of Sant’ Erasmo, and in the same year the Republic summoned\r\nlearned professors of medicine from Padua—Girolamo Mercuriale and\r\nGiovanni Capodivacca—to identify the disease, and it was no fault of\r\nthe Republic that they pronounced it not to be plague.\r\n\r\nA curious evidence of the mutual influence of religion and therapeutics\r\non each other is the fixing of quarantine at forty days, because this\r\nwas the period that Christ dwelt apart in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nVenetian doctors for the most part seem now to have mended their ways\r\nand devoted themselves loyally to the service of the sick. In a book\r\npublished in Venice in A.D. 1493, _Fasciculus medicus Johannis de\r\nKetam_, the physician Pietro da Fossignano is shown visiting a plague\r\npatient. As he feels the pulse, he holds to his mouth and nostrils\r\na sponge, steeped in some antipestilential aromatic. Pietro’s death\r\nabout A.D. 1400 helps towards fixing the date of this simple clinical\r\nprecaution. In later years a special plague dress was devised for\r\ndoctors, which was adopted from Italy by France, and of which several\r\nengravings exist of about the time of the 1720 plague of Marseilles\r\n(see pp. 206-8). Ambroise Paré recommends that the material should be\r\ncamlet, serge, satin, taffeta, or morocco, but not cloth, frieze, or\r\nfur, which might harbour the poison and carry death to the healthy.\r\n\r\nVenice had also her street ambulance in the brotherhood of S. Rocco,\r\ninstituted for the purpose of conveying the sick to hospital and the\r\ndead to burial. Their services were sorely taxed in times of plague.\r\nA specimen of the working dress of the Order may still be seen in the\r\nTreasury of the Scuola di San Rocco. It is a loose white cotton overall\r\nwith full hanging sleeves. On each side of the chest is an oval white\r\nsatin badge, embroidered with red silk and edged with red lace. On one\r\nthe figure of Christ is embroidered in silk: on the other that of S.\r\nRocco with his dog. It is bound at the waist with a corded girdle of\r\nwhite cotton with heavily ornamented cotton tassels at each end. A deep\r\npeaked hood of the same material completely covers the head, having\r\nonly slits as apertures for the eyes. White leather gloves complete\r\nthe costume. A similar dress was worn by many of the charitable\r\nconfraternities of Central Italy, and is to be seen in several Sienese\r\npictures (see Plate VIII). It has its modern counterpart in the\r\noperating dress of the aseptic surgeon, but by a queer turn of the\r\nwhirligig of time its purpose is no longer to keep infection out, but\r\nto keep it in.\r\n\r\nThe Guild of San Rocco had come into existence at least as early as\r\nA.D. 1415, but it was not till 1478 that leave was obtained from\r\nthe Government to enlist a confraternity under the standard of San\r\nRocco. Its first meeting-place was the church of San Giuliano, but\r\nin 1485 the guild undertook to build a church for the custody of the\r\nbody of the saint, which some Venetians had surreptitiously removed\r\nfrom Montpellier. Five years sufficed to complete the church, and the\r\nsaint’s body was laid in it with great solemnity. The precious relic\r\nwas destined to bestow great prestige on its possessors. Of the five\r\ngreat charitable guilds of Venice, that of S. Rocco was by far the\r\ngreatest. From 1516 to the end of the Republic each Doge was enrolled\r\na member, along with many of the richest merchants of Venice. In this\r\nyear the brethren determined to erect a meeting-house adjacent to the\r\nchurch, which should be an added ornament to the city. So the building\r\nof the Scuola was commenced in 1517 by Bartolommeo Bon, only to be\r\nfinished in 1550 by Antonio Scarpagnino.\r\n\r\nWhile the Scuola was in course of construction, the original church\r\nof S. Rocco was found to be insecure, and was rebuilt, but not in its\r\npresent form, which is no older than 1725. In 1559 the Confraternity\r\nentrusted its decoration to Tintoretto, and there are still to be seen\r\nthere, on the rare occasions when daylight suffices, the four pictures\r\nin which the artist set himself to illustrate the life of the saint.\r\nThese are (1) St. Roch in hospital; (2) St. Roch healing animals; (3)\r\nThe capture of St. Roch; (4) The appearance of an angel to St. Roch in\r\nprison. The small picture that hangs by a side-altar—the ‘Betrayal of\r\nChrist’, by Titian—has received all the homage that should have been\r\npaid to Tintoretto’s subjects: indeed, the offerings rendered to this\r\n‘miraculous’ picture enabled the guild to rebuild their Scuola. To this\r\nchurch the Doge came yearly on August 16 to implore St. Roch to ward\r\noff plague from the Republic.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 the growing wealth of the guild induced them to call in\r\ncompetition the leading painters of Venice to decorate the halls of\r\nthe Scuola. Andrea Schiavone, Federigo Zuccaro, Giuseppe Salviati,\r\nPaolo Veronese, and Tintoretto were all invited to prepare drawings and\r\nsubmit them to the judges on the appointed day. While the others had\r\nmerely sketched designs, Tintoretto had finished a complete picture,\r\n‘St. Roch in glory’, that now occupies the centre of the ceiling of the\r\nrefectory. To ensure still further his success, Tintoretto presented\r\nthe picture to the guild. From this time until 1588 the decoration of\r\nthe Scuola formed the chief part of Tintoretto’s work. By the beginning\r\nof 1566 he had completed the superb ‘Crucifixion’ in the refectory\r\nof the upper hall, and on its completion he was admitted to the\r\nConfraternity, and assigned an annual subsidy of 100 ducats (about £50)\r\nin payment for three finished pictures each year. Here, at any rate,\r\nhe found scope for the expression of an inexhaustible fancy: but those\r\nwho have attempted to study the paintings of the Scuola will appreciate\r\nsomething of the difficulties he had to surmount owing to the defective\r\nlight which, as in the church, renders the pictures invisible except on\r\nthe brightest days.\r\n\r\nAs Michelangelo had done in the Sistine Chapel, so Tintoretto thought\r\nout in advance a comprehensive and harmonious scheme for the entire\r\nadornment of the halls. The key-note of it all is the dedication of the\r\nScuola to San Rocco, the patron saint of the plague-stricken, and also\r\nof those who ministered to them. So the paintings in the upper hall\r\nrepresent acts of mercy and deliverance, illustrated in Christ’s life\r\non earth. Those in the lower hall of entrance, eight in number, setting\r\nforth mainly the history of the Virgin and her infant Son, form thus\r\nan appropriate prelude to the upper series. Giovanni Marchiori and his\r\npupils have faithfully pursued the scheme in the twenty subjects from\r\nthe life of St. Roch carved in the panelling of the upper hall. The\r\ngreat staircase that joins the two halls is decorated with frescoes of\r\nplague scenes by Zanchi (1666) and Negri (1673), of little artistic\r\nmerit. Yet another memorial of plague survives in the rows of wooden\r\nstandard lamps, set round the upper hall, which the brethren used to\r\ncarry in processions to the honour of their patron saint.\r\n\r\nTintoretto was still at his work in the Scuola when the appalling\r\nplague of 1575-7 fell on Venice, carrying Titian to his grave, within\r\nclose hail of his centenary. While others were hurried away to obscure\r\nburial in the common plague pits of Sant’ Erasmo and the outlying\r\nislands, the body of the old man, who had brought so great glory to\r\nVenice, was accorded the honour of a public funeral by order of the\r\nSignoria. After lying in state it was carried to the beautiful Gothic\r\nchurch of S. Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, wearing the insignia of Imperial\r\nKnighthood, conferred on him by Charles V, and placed in a tomb at\r\nthe foot of the altar of the Cross. Here Titian sleeps his last sleep\r\nunmindful, be it hoped, of the outrage in marble inflicted on his\r\nmemory by Ferdinand I of Austria, at the hands of Luigi and Pietro\r\nZandomeneghi. Titian’s eldest son died with him, and his second son,\r\nPomponio, a canon of Milan, hastened to Venice, as soon as he was\r\nassured that all danger was past, and quickly dissipated the fortune\r\nthat the painter had amassed by the thrift and labour of a lifetime.\r\n\r\nFor three years this plague devastated Venice, carrying off no less\r\nthan 50,000 souls, one quarter of her whole population. The Doge,\r\nLuigi Mocenigo, displayed throughout the utmost courage and devotion.\r\nHe himself superintended all the efforts to arrest the plague, and\r\nministered in person to the sick. He went in solemn procession with\r\nall the confraternities of Venice to the church of S. Rocco, to vow\r\nthe erection of another church, if only the saint would intercede\r\nfor them. As Cyprian and Gregory had done before him, he addressed\r\nwords of consolation and encouragement to his people in the sanctuary\r\nof his cathedral church. But Luigi was dead when the day came for\r\nhis successor to summon the people of Venice to St. Mark’s to fulfil\r\nLuigi’s vow.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself Venice one July Sunday under a cloudless sky. From\r\nthe pulpit of St. Mark’s some aged patriarch has proclaimed the freedom\r\nof the city from plague. Out of the coloured gloom of the church files\r\nthe procession into the dazzling glare of the Piazza. All Venice is\r\nthere: Venice is in jubilant mood. St. Mark’s, Ducal Palace, Campanile,\r\nand all the buildings around are gay with carpets and tapestries, with\r\npictures and gilded shields. Banners of gorgeous colours flutter to\r\nthe crisp sea-breeze from the columns of Theodore and the Lion. Amid\r\nwild shouting of people and roar of cannon, and ringing of bells\r\nthe procession wheels to the Piazzetta. Before it lies the lagoon,\r\nstretching over to S. Giorgio Maggiore, and away to the Lido beyond,\r\nsparkling and shimmering in the sunlight, like some great scintillating\r\njewel. God and man seem to have joined hands there to create the\r\nfairest spot of earth. From Piazzetta to Giudecca a bridge of boats has\r\nbeen thrown over, near half a mile in length. On to the bridge goes\r\nthe procession.[175] The guilds and confraternities, displaying their\r\nrespective standards and carrying crosses, images of the Madonna and\r\nsaints, and reliquaries, lead the way, followed by magistrates, nobles,\r\nand their ladies. Next come the patriarchs, the Church dignitaries, and\r\ncanons in their rochets, the friars, chanting, under the banners of\r\ntheir fourteen orders, the clergy robed in rich copes embroidered with\r\ngold and sewn with jewels, under their eleven banners. Last of all,\r\naccompanied by senators and ambassadors, comes the Doge, Sebastiano\r\nVenier, hero of Lepanto, a noble figure, robed in white with a splendid\r\nmantle of silver brocade hanging from his shoulders. In a temporary\r\nwooden oratory built close to the place where the Redentore Church was\r\nto rise from the plans of Palladio, Mass was sung this day to music by\r\nGiuseppe Zarlino of Chioggia, the Doge’s chief musician. And the sound\r\nof this jubilant day has echoed down the ages and may be still heard\r\nat the yearly _Festa del Redentore_ in July, as the procession passes\r\nover its bridges of boats from San Zobenigo to Zattere, and Zattere\r\nto Giudecca, but shorn of much of its former glory. Where stood the\r\nwooden chauntry stands now Palladio’s church, a plague-spot on the face\r\nof nature. Théophile Gautier, nevertheless, saw beauty in its aspect\r\nby the light of the setting sun. Within there are no pictures and no\r\nmemorials of the plague to which it owes its being. A Venetian medal,\r\nshowing the Doge with the banner of St. Mark kneeling before Christ,\r\ncommemorates this plague.\r\n\r\nVenice has other churches to commemorate her plagues besides San Rocco\r\nand the Redentore; oldest of all, S. Giobbe, church and convent, built\r\nin the middle of the fifteenth century (1462-71) by Doge Cristoforo\r\nMoro, the friend of S. Bernardino, and dedicated to the Job of\r\nScripture who was plagued with all manner of diseases. Over the high\r\naltar was once the famous picture by Giovanni Bellini, now in the\r\nAccademia, of the Madonna and Child enthroned between St. Job, St. John\r\nBaptist, St. Sebastian, St. Francis, and St. Louis of Toulouse. Venice\r\nbrought the cult of S. Giobbe along with plague from the east: he is\r\nhardly known elsewhere in Italy.\r\n\r\nOnly a few years later (1506-18) another plague church, that\r\nof S. Sebastiano, was built for the Order of St. Jerome by the\r\ntwo architects, F. da Castiglione and A. Scarpagnino. It is the\r\nburial-place of Veronese, to whom most of its decoration is due. The\r\nceilings of both church and sacristy are enriched with his pictures,\r\nset in deep gilded mouldings. Over the high altar is an ‘Apotheosis of\r\nSt. Sebastian’, to whom the Madonna appears in heaven, along with St.\r\nMark, St. Jerome, St. John Baptist, and St. Catharine of Alexandria.\r\nTo the left of the altar is Veronese’s famous ‘Martyrdom of Marcus and\r\nMarcellinus’.\r\n\r\nWhile this church was building Giorgione died of plague. About his four\r\nand thirtieth year he had become wildly enamoured of a young woman, and\r\nwhen the plague seized her he still paid her secret visits, and taking\r\nthe sickness from her lips with her kisses, he paid for his love with\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nLast, but best known of all, is the church of S. Maria della Salute,\r\nbegun by Baldassare Longhena in 1632, to commemorate the plague of\r\n1630-1, which carried off 46,490 in Venice, and 94,235 in the whole\r\nlagoons. Doge Niccolò Contarini had vowed a church to the Madonna of\r\nHealth, if she would deliver the Republic from the plague. During its\r\nbuilding a temporary wooden oratory was built on a piece of land, which\r\nthe Knights Templar had bestowed on the Republic, and Doge, Council,\r\nnobles, and people crossed over the Grand Canal by a bridge of boats\r\nto hear a solemn Mass. In the sacristy of Longhena’s church are two\r\nseventeenth century prints, one showing the procession as it crosses\r\nthe pontoon bridge, the other, as it files up into the church. Each\r\nyear in November the procession starts from St. Mark’s and crosses the\r\nGrand Canal by the Redentore route, and circles round the church to\r\nthe entrance facing the Canal. Modern Venice has transformed a solemn\r\npageant into a fancy fair. These prints show the church as it now\r\nstands, on a platform at the top of a great flight of stairs leading\r\nup from the Grand Canal, but a statue of the Madonna has replaced the\r\nAngel of Pestilence on the summit of its larger dome.\r\n\r\nS. Maria della Salute contains many memorials of plague. Over the high\r\naltar is a heavy group of marble statuary by Giusto il Corto. In the\r\ncentre sits the Madonna holding her Child, with cherubs at her feet. On\r\none side kneels a woman entreating her aid: on the other a cherub with\r\nflaming torch expels a plague demon of human form.\r\n\r\nIn the vault of the choir is a ceiling painting by Fiammingo showing\r\nVenice imploring liberation from plague.\r\n\r\nIn the sacristy is Titian’s picture of St. Mark with St. Sebastian,\r\nSt. Roch, Cosmas, and St. Damian, commemorating the plague of 1512, in\r\nwhich Giorgione perished (see Plate IX). Here, too, is Marco Basaiti’s\r\n(second half of fifteenth century) votive picture of St. Sebastian,\r\na fine figure in a beautiful Umbrian landscape, but not the peer of\r\nSodoma’s saint: and yet another picture of St. Roch, St. Sebastian, and\r\nSt. Jerome by Girolamo da Treviso (1497-1544).\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[174] Horatio Brown, _The Venetian Republic_.\r\n\r\n[175] Molmenti, _Venezia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nMilan had suffered from the Black Death far less than other cities\r\nof Italy: maybe she had acquired a transient immunity. For the three\r\nsucceeding centuries her history is one long catalogue of plagues, of\r\nwhich two claim special notice.\r\n\r\nIn 1576 plague broke out in late July. Carlo Borromeo was archbishop\r\nat the time. The son of Ghiberto Borromeo, Count of Arona, and Mary\r\nde Medici, Carlo was of noble parentage. His influence gained for him\r\nin early life the archbishopric of Milan. Amid all his wealth his\r\nown personal life was ordered with temperance and humility. Stern,\r\nor as some say cruel, to track out and repress all the abuses that\r\nhad invaded the Church in his diocese, he earned the jealous dislike\r\nof his clergy and of the religious orders. The Brothers of Humility\r\nmade open attempt on his life, but by a miracle he escaped them.\r\nCarlo was away at Lodi when news reached him that plague had broken\r\nout in Milan. Hastening back to the city he found that the governor,\r\nmany officials, and all the rich had fled. All was in chaos. The\r\npeople turned in despair to their spiritual father, and entrusted\r\nthe care of the town to him. He set them to work at once to adapt\r\nthe great hospital of St. Gregory for the reception of the sick, and\r\nlater to build six lazarettos of wood outside the walls. All these he\r\nequipped and furnished with linen from his own palace. For its better\r\nadministration he divided the city into four quarters, and put over\r\neach an overseer with a staff of helpers. His example of courage and\r\npersonal devotion served to attract many of the secular clergy, monks,\r\nand nuns to the service of the sick. Even lay men and women organized\r\na nursing guild among themselves. Carlo himself went everywhere,\r\ngiving directions for housing the sick and burying the dead. He visited\r\neven those parishes beyond the walls, where the disease was raging,\r\nproviding for the sick, feeding the needy, and rousing the clergy to\r\nthe loyal discharge of their duty. Famine soon came to add another\r\nhorror to pestilence. Borromeo collected all the destitute into an\r\nencampment and arranged the supply of food. First he had all his own\r\nsilver plate melted down to provide the necessary money. When this ran\r\nout, he begged it from door to door, and finally incurred huge debts on\r\nhis own personal security. Beyond such material aids as these, Carlo\r\nBorromeo brought to the stricken Milanese the spiritual comforts of\r\nreligion. From the pulpit of his cathedral he expounded to them the\r\nLamentations of Jeremiah, showing them how they applied to Milan. From\r\nthe altar steps he chanted with quivering voice the penitential psalms,\r\nand kneeling before the altar offered himself to God as a sacrifice\r\nfor his people. Through the streets of the city he marched at the head\r\nof penitential processions with bare feet and the rope of the criminal\r\naround his neck. But through it all he passed unscathed, himself and\r\nhis eight-and-twenty attendant priests. Only 17,000 died in Milan,\r\nand 8,000 in the districts round about: that so few died out of so\r\nvast a multitude of sick was attributed to the ministrations of their\r\narchbishop.\r\n\r\nAs the traveller comes down from the Alps, skirting the shores of\r\nLago Maggiore, where gardens are radiant in spring with camellias,\r\nmagnolias, mimosa, and myrtle, one feature only blurs the faultless\r\nlandscape. On a ridge, high over the lake at Arona, towers on its\r\npedestal the statue of Carlo Borromeo, a senseless, soulless colossus,\r\nin copper and bronze, mocking the skies. Your guide-book tells you you\r\nmay go up inside its body. If you do so on a hot day you may learn\r\nsomething of the sufferings of Phalaris, roasted in the belly of his\r\nown brazen bull. But perhaps you will do as well to stay beneath and\r\npray that something rather of the spirit oi Borromeo may enter into\r\nyour soul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI PROCESSION TO S. MARIA DELLA SALUTE, VENICE\r\n\r\nFrom a seventeenth century engraving (Face Page 172)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXII (Face Page 173)\r\n\r\nCARLO BORROMEO. BY ANNIBALE CARRACCI]\r\n\r\nReligion has canonized S. Carlo Borromeo; Art has ensured him\r\nimmortality. In the churches and galleries of Milan he figures as\r\npatron saint against plague, sometimes alone, sometimes conjointly\r\nwith St. Roch. In Venice he gives place to St. Roch, in Florence to\r\nSt. Sebastian. In parts of Central Italy S. Carlo reappears, attended\r\noften by local saints, interceding with the Madonna. In the church of\r\nS. Dominico in Perugia a picture shows him along with S. Catharine of\r\nSiena, supplicating the Virgin. At S. Carlo in Corso at Rome, along\r\nwith S. Ambrose, he intercedes with Christ, and another picture in the\r\nsame church represents his apotheosis.\r\n\r\nMemorials of Borromeo are innumerable. The sacristy of Milan Cathedral\r\ncontains a life-size effigy in mitre and robes, all in wrought silver:\r\nalso a gilded wooden cross, on which the various emblems of the Passion\r\nare carved in relief, which he carried in plague processions: also a\r\nsilk embroidered portrait of him in his mitre. S. Carlo Catinari at\r\nRome has one of his mitres, and part of the rope that he wore as a\r\nhalter.\r\n\r\nBeneath the floor of Milan Cathedral, below the dome and in front of\r\nthe choir, is the Cappella of Carlo Borromeo. His remains lie in a\r\nsilver coffin, supported on a silver altar, each elaborately engraved\r\nand embossed. The hexagonal chamber has the whole surface of its\r\nwalls coated with plates of silver, on which are reliefs representing\r\na series of scenes from his life. In one he is giving alms to the\r\nplague-stricken: in a second he is baptizing children in a plague\r\nhospital: in a third he is walking with feet and head bare, and with\r\na halter round his neck, in a plague procession, preceding the sacred\r\nrelics that are carried beneath a canopy.\r\n\r\nPortraits of S. Carlo in Milan, those in the Cathedral, in the\r\nBorromeo Palace and elsewhere, all in profile, show the prominent nose\r\nand receding forehead and a degree of ugliness that would almost seem\r\nto forbid enrolment in the catalogue of the saints. A rugged full-faced\r\nportrait by Annibale Carracci (1560-1609), now in the Hermitage at St.\r\nPetersburg, seems less discordant with the halo.\r\n\r\nPietro da Cortona (1596-1669) painted a picture of Borromeo heading\r\na plague procession, which is one of the best of its kind. It is now\r\nover the altar of S. Carlo Catinari at Rome, but hidden from view by a\r\nbrazen symbol of rays of glory.\r\n\r\nThe familiar theme of innumerable pictures both in Italy and France\r\nis Carlo Borromeo carrying the Sacrament to the plague-stricken. Some\r\nof the best known are those by Jakob van Oost (le Vieux) (1600-71) in\r\nthe Louvre: by Lemonnier in the Musée at Rouen: by Cigoli (1559-1613)\r\nin the church of Santa Maria Nuova at Cortona: by Francesco Gossi in\r\nthe church of Poveri at Bologna: and by Baldassare Franceschini in the\r\nchurch of the Barnabites at Pescia.\r\n\r\nThe Flemish painter Gaspard de Crayer (1585-1669) has varied somewhat\r\nthe hackneyed features of the subject. In his picture, Carlo Borromeo,\r\nin red episcopal robes, followed by two acolytes carrying the taper and\r\ncross, bends down and offers the Sacrament to a dying man, who kneels\r\nbefore him with head bandaged and shirt thrown open over his bare\r\nchest. Behind the man are two women, one of whom supports his body,\r\nwhile the other in the shadow of a doorway carries a glass of water\r\nin her hand. Kneeling beside the man, with hands joined in prayer, a\r\nlittle boy awaits the Sacrament: in the foreground lies a dead child.\r\nBefore this little corpse a man is seated on the ground, supporting his\r\nhead, his legs bare and covered with ulcers. Behind him are two women,\r\none of whom covers her mouth with a handkerchief, while the other\r\nstretches out her hands to an attendant deacon, who is distributing\r\nalms. The background is a street of Milan with a vista of open country\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII (Face Page 174)\r\n\r\nBORROMEO LEADING A PLAGUE PROCESSION\r\n\r\nBy Pietro da Cortona]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV (Face Page 175)\r\n\r\nBORROMEO INTERCEDING FOR THE PLAGUE-STRICKEN\r\n\r\nA marble bas-relief by P. Puget]\r\n\r\nPuget (1622-94) has represented the same subject in a marble\r\nbas-relief, now in the Santé at Marseilles. Borromeo kneels in earnest\r\nsupplication amid a group of dead and dying. His eyes are fixed on a\r\ncross borne aloft by cherubs. He is attended by acolytes, who carry a\r\ncross and chalice, and a child clings to his robes. In the foreground a\r\nconvict drags off a corpse for burial. In the background a woman bends\r\nin wild despair over a bed, on which a dead man is stretched.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1630 occurred the Great Plague of Milan, well known to many by\r\nthe description of Manzoni (1785-1873) in his _Promessi Sposi_. For\r\nhis information he has drawn on many sources, and not least on the\r\ncontemporary record of Canon Ripamonti, written by request of the\r\nMagistracy as a supplement to his History of Milan.\r\n\r\nThis volume on the plague bears an emblematic engraving on the\r\ntitle-page. A skeleton holds in his hands weapons, armour, bones, and\r\nbooks all strung together. The toes of his feet protrude from beneath\r\na carpet on which lies a plague-stricken man. In front of the skeleton\r\nis an altar, on which stand taper and crucifix. Beside the altar sits\r\na woman, a drawn sword in her right hand, her left arm embracing a\r\nstork: a naked child is by her side. On the frontal of the altar is the\r\ntitle of the book: ‘Josephi Ripamontii, Canonici Scalensis Chronistae\r\nUrbis Mediolani, De Peste Quae Fuit Anno cIɔIɔcxxx Libri V, Desumpti Ex\r\nAnnalibus Urbis Quos LX Decurionum Autoritate Scribebat.’\r\n\r\nIn his _Storia della Colonna Infame_, published in 1840, Manzoni\r\nhas told the trial and punishment of the two _Untori_, accused of\r\nspreading the plague by means of ointments. The home of one of them\r\nwas destroyed by order of the State, and the ground on which it stood\r\ndeclared accursed. On it a stone column was erected in 1630, bearing\r\nthe following inscription:[176]\r\n\r\n      ‘Here, where this plot of ground extends, formerly\r\n    stood the shop of the barber, Giangiacomo Mora, who\r\n    had conspired with Guglielmo Piazza, Commissary of\r\n    the Public Health, and with others, while a frightful\r\n    plague exercised its ravages, by means of deadly\r\n    ointments spread on all sides, to hurl many citizens to\r\n    a cruel death. For this, the Senate, having declared\r\n    them both to be enemies of their country, decreed that,\r\n    placed on an elevated car, their flesh should be torn\r\n    with red-hot pincers, their right hands be cut off, and\r\n    their bones be broken: that they should be extended on\r\n    the wheel, and at the end of six hours be put to death\r\n    and burnt. Then, and that there might remain no trace\r\n    of these guilty men, their possessions should be sold\r\n    at public sale, and their ashes be thrown into the\r\n    river; and to perpetuate the memory of their deed the\r\n    Senate wills, that the house in which the crime was\r\n    projected shall be razed to the ground, shall never\r\n    be rebuilt, and that in its place a column shall be\r\n    erected, which shall be called Infamous. Keep afar\r\n    off, then, afar off, good citizens, lest this accursed\r\n    ground should pollute you with its infamy. August 1630.’\r\n\r\nThis cursing of the site recalls the curse of Joshua[177] on the site\r\nof Jericho after its capture: ‘Cursed be the man before the Lord, that\r\nriseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation\r\nthereof in his first-born, and in his youngest son shall he set up the\r\ngates of it.’ And the Constitutions of Moses[178] pronounced a similar\r\ncurse on cities that turned aside from the true religion.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 Count Pietro Verri, Counsellor of State in the service of Maria\r\nTheresa, published a treatise on Torture, in which special reference\r\nwas made to this case at Milan in 1630. His work, however, did not see\r\nthe light till 1804. Then in 1839 the _Processo originate degli Untori\r\nnella peste del 1630_ was issued in Milan, giving a full official\r\naccount of the trial of these Anointers. Fletcher, in 1895, drew up a\r\nsummary of evidence from all the sources in his _Tragedy of the Great\r\nPlague of Milan_.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of June 21, 1630, one Catarina Rosa, a woman\r\nof the lower classes, saw from the balcony of her house a man going\r\ndown the street writing on a sheet of paper. He stopped to wipe his\r\nfingers on the wall of a house, probably to get rid of ink-stains,\r\nbut the woman’s fear at once conjured up the superstitious image of\r\na deadly ointment smeared on the walls to spread the plague. A crowd\r\nof excited women flocked to the Council Chamber to inform the Senate,\r\nwho at once ordered the man’s arrest. Henceforth no one dared touch\r\na wall. Ripamonti tells how three young French travellers fared, who\r\nin admiring the marble of a temple unsuspectingly ventured to touch\r\nit. Someone saw them do it, and raised the alarm. Forthwith they were\r\nsavagely set upon and hurled into gaol, and only released when it was\r\nfound that there was no vestige of evidence to suggest anything but\r\ninnocent curiosity.\r\n\r\nAgain, an old man of eighty was seen to dust a bench in the church of\r\nSt. Anthony with his cloak before sitting down. Immediately the women\r\ncried out that he was anointing the benches, and the worshippers set\r\non him there and then in the church, and after beating him brutally\r\ndragged him before the magistrates. Ripamonti believes that he died of\r\nhis injuries.\r\n\r\nThe search for the suspected Anointer resulted in the arrest of one\r\nGuglielmo Piazza, a scrivener who carried an ink-horn at his belt. He\r\nwas also a commissioner of health, that is to say, a petty official\r\nemployed to report cases of plague. Throughout two applications\r\nof torture he stoutly denied the offence, but in his cell, broken\r\nwith suffering and fearing a renewal of torture, he yielded to the\r\nsuggestions of those around him. He confessed his guilt, and declared\r\nthat he obtained the deadly ointment from the barber Giangiacomo Mora.\r\nThis man was straightway arrested and carried to the court, but there\r\nvehemently asserted his innocence and vowed that he had never seen\r\nPiazza. Under torture, however, he gave way, and vied with the unhappy\r\nMora in concocting falsehoods. Among others, they implicated Count\r\nPadilla, son of the Commandant of the Castle, but in the end he was\r\nacquitted, and it is from the notes of his trial that Verri obtained\r\nthe material for the narrative of Piazza and Mora.\r\n\r\nMora, like most barbers of his day, dabbled in medicine, so that\r\nmedicinal jars and vessels were found in his shop. These, he asserted,\r\ncontained preservatives against the plague, and probably with truth,\r\nfor during epidemics of plague they were in great demand. Ambroise Paré\r\ngives an elaborate formula for a preservative water, with which to wash\r\nthe body frequently and rinse the mouth, and a few drops of it were to\r\nbe placed as well in the nostrils and ears. Similar nostrums were in\r\ngreat demand during the Great Plague of London and that of Marseilles\r\nin 1720.\r\n\r\nPiazza had occasionally visited Mora’s shop as a customer of the\r\nbarber, and both stated that Mora had undertaken to prepare a pot of\r\nhis preservative for Piazza. On this innocent transaction was to be\r\nbuilt up a charge of wholesale murder. Mora was induced by torture to\r\nadmit that Piazza had supplied him with foam from the mouths of plague\r\nvictims to mix with his ointment.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of torture Mora and Piazza more than once recanted and\r\ndeclared that their confessions were false, but a renewal of torture\r\nsoon induced them to retract. The ignorant ferocity of the populace\r\ncalled aloud for satisfaction. At the conclusion of their examination\r\nthe unhappy victims were carried off for the execution of a terrible\r\nsentence, in spite of the pledge of impunity. With the merciful\r\nprospect of death before them, they openly asserted that all their\r\nadmissions incriminating others were false and had been extracted from\r\nthem by their terror of further torture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV TORTURE AND EXECUTION OF THE ANOINTERS (Face\r\nPage 179)]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the _Processo originale degl’ Untori_ is a folded plate\r\nrepresenting in all its details the execution of Piazza and Mora.\r\nIt is a rough reproduction of an older undated engraving, which\r\nFletcher has reproduced from a copy in the collection of medical\r\nprints and engravings in the library of the Surgeon-General’s Office\r\nat Washington. The engraver of this was Orazio Colombo, and it was\r\npublished in Rome by the authority of the Nuncio of the Roman College.\r\n\r\nOn the top of the engraving is its title, which may be translated, ‘The\r\nsentence pronounced on those, who had poisoned many persons in Milan\r\nin the year 1630.’ Fletcher appends this further description: ‘This is\r\nfollowed by the names of the Magnificos, who sat in judgement, and the\r\nparticulars of the punishment decreed. Each scene in the picture has\r\nits letter, which is referred to in an explanatory legend below. The\r\nentire disregard of the unities of time and place, which characterized\r\nsuch productions, is well displayed in this curious engraving. On the\r\nright is the shop of the barber Mora, and in front of it the “Column of\r\nInfamy” is already erected. A large platform car, drawn by two oxen,\r\nexhibits the victims, executioners, and priests. A brazier of live\r\ncharcoal contains the pincers with which the flesh was to be torn. The\r\nbarber’s right hand is on the block, and a chopper held over the wrist\r\nis about to be struck down by a mallet held aloft by the executioner.\r\nFurther on is seen a large platform, on which the two victims are\r\nhaving their limbs broken by an iron bar, preparatory to their exposure\r\non the wheel for six hours. The wheels are also displayed, one of them\r\nalready on a pole, with the men bound upon them. Still further on are\r\nthe fires consuming the bodies, and, last scene of all, on the extreme\r\nleft is a fussy little stream, foaming under bridges, which is supposed\r\nto be a river, and into it a man is throwing the ashes of the two\r\nmalefactors.’\r\n\r\nOne dark night in 1788 Nature for very shame let loose a storm that\r\nwrecked the Column: her minion Man then tardily demolished the monument\r\nof his own infamy. The balcony of Catarina Rosa’s house was also taken\r\ndown, so that no structure stands to call to mind the hideous tragedy.\r\nThe corner-house of the Vedra de’ Cittadini, on the left hand as one\r\ncomes from the Corso di Porta Ticinese, occupies the site of poor\r\nMora’s house. A dwelling has rested on the accursed site since 1803.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising to find that not only does not Ripamonti deny the\r\nguilt of the victims, but now and again he seems to hint at its\r\nreality. It has to be borne in mind that in his position as official\r\nhistoriographer of Milan it was hardly permissible for him to express\r\nsentiments opposed to popular conviction and the decisions of the\r\ncourts of justice. As late as 1832, during an epidemic of cholera\r\nin St. Petersburg, the most circumstantial statements of miscreants\r\nputting poison in the food and drink of the people were in every mouth.\r\n\r\nManzoni’s _Colonna Infame_ is a simple unadorned narrative of the\r\ntrial and execution of the two Anointers, quite different in literary\r\nform from his _Promessi Sposi_. It is written with a definite purpose\r\nin view. Verri had introduced the story into his _Observations on\r\nTorture_, merely as an illustration of the way in which the confession\r\nof a crime, both physically and morally impossible, may be extracted\r\nby torture. Manzoni retells the tale, in the interest of humanity at\r\nlarge, to show that no matter how deep may have been the belief in\r\nthe efficacy of ointments, and despite the existence of a legislature\r\nthat countenanced and approved torture, it was competent to the judges\r\nto convict them, only by recourse to artifices and expedients, of the\r\ninjustice of which they were perfectly well aware.\r\n\r\nManzoni’s _Promessi Sposi_ is a happy blend of antiquarian research\r\nand imaginative description, and the incidents of the plague are\r\ndexterously woven into the fabric of his story. Manzoni wrote at a\r\ntime when literature, freed from the trammels of convention, was being\r\nslowly brought into harmony with the outlook of modern thought. Though\r\nan aristocrat by birth, his upbringing had taught him to regard life\r\nwith the eyes of the peasant, and not with those of his overlord. In\r\nhis genius for romance and in his reverence for the past Manzoni has\r\nmuch in common with Scott, but with this difference, that Scott sees\r\nthe social fabric from above, Manzoni from below. To Scott life was a\r\npageant in which knights of chivalry and courtly dames shared all the\r\nleading parts: Manzoni’s stage is filled with men struggling to be rid\r\nof the yoke of feudal oppression. The plague of Milan, falling alike on\r\nrich and poor, afforded him the text from which to preach the essential\r\nequality of all men. His whole narrative is so moulded as to throw\r\ninto striking contrast the vices of the rich with the virtues of the\r\npoor. The plague scenes, too, give him scope for his remarkable insight\r\ninto the psychology of crowds, and for his skill in marshalling men\r\nin masses, a gift in which he rivals Tintoretto. It is the genius of\r\nManzoni that he persuades without preaching.\r\n\r\nThe total mortality of this pestilence in Milan has been estimated\r\nroughly at 150,000 persons. The Sanità, or Board of Health, profiting\r\nby the lessons of the previous plague, seem to have acted with sense\r\nand energy, though hampered by the ignorant obstinacy of the Senate,\r\nthe Council of Decurions, and the Magistrates, who were afraid of\r\ndriving away trade, if the presence of plague were admitted. One\r\nstrange remedial measure was the organization of an immense procession\r\nthrough the streets in honour of San Carlo. During the procession all\r\nthe sequestered houses were fastened up with nails to prevent the\r\ninfected inmates from joining in it. Deaths were so numerous at the\r\nheight of the plague that the burial-pits were filled, and bodies lay\r\nputrefying in the houses and streets. The Sanità sought the help of\r\ntwo priests, who undertook to dispose of all the corpses in four days.\r\nWith the assistance of peasants, whom they summoned from the country in\r\nthe name of religion, three immense pits were dug. The Sanità employed\r\n_monatti_ to bring out the dead and cart them to the pits, and the\r\npriests accomplished their task within the appointed time. Besides\r\nthe _monatti_ they appointed _apparitores_, or summoners, who went in\r\nadvance of the _monatti_ ringing a bell to warn the people to bring out\r\ntheir dead. _Commissari_ supervised both _apparitores_ and _monatti_.\r\nPiazza was one of these overseers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plagues of the seventeenth century have left behind them very many\r\nmemorials both in literature and in art: among them the great plague of\r\nMilan is only one of many.\r\n\r\nSouthern France was attacked again and again, and in 1643 plague raged\r\nfiercely at Lyons. Over the portico of the church of Notre-Dame de\r\nFourvière, which stands high up on the precipitous hill that overhangs\r\nthe town, is a frieze commemorating this plague.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, city after city succumbed. Guido’s picture, ‘Il Pallione\r\ndel Voto,’ reminds us that Bologna suffered along with Milan. Venice\r\nsuffered too, and out of her ruin rose the church of S. Maria della\r\nSalute.\r\n\r\nFlorence retains in the Bargello a hideous reminiscence of her\r\nvisitation in a wax representation of ‘Pestilenza’ by Zumbo Gaetano\r\nGiulio (1656-1701). Corpses are lying about in various stages of\r\ndecomposition: among them lies a dead mother beside her infant child. A\r\nman, whose nostrils are covered with a bandage, attempts to carry away\r\na corpse. In the background great bonfires are burning. The modelling\r\nof the carcases is anatomically exact, but the production as a whole is\r\nutterly repulsive.\r\n\r\nIn 1656 Naples assumes the leading rôle in this hideous Dance of\r\nDeath. Soldiers brought the plague on a transport from Sardinia. At\r\nfirst the viceroy attempted to disguise the true character of the\r\ndisease. The first doctor who dared to pronounce the sickness plague\r\nwas promptly put in prison. Malcontents spread the report that the\r\nSpaniards had designedly introduced the plague, and were employing\r\npeople to go through the city in disguise, sowing broadcast poisoned\r\ndust. The infuriated populace turned on the Spanish soldiery, who\r\nsought safety by transferring the accusation to the French. Nothing but\r\nblood would satisfy the mob, and Angelucci di Tivoli, reputed author of\r\nthe plague powder, was broken on the wheel as a peace-offering to their\r\nbloodt-hirsty fury. The Spaniards were accused also of poisoning the\r\nholy water in the churches by means of the deadly powder. Superstition\r\nwas rampant in every form. One said that he had been miraculously cured\r\nby drinking holy water before an image of the Virgin. Another saw a\r\nmarble statue of the Madonna and Child in the church of S. Severo\r\ncovered with sweat, and the faces of both livid and marked by the\r\nplague. A doctor, Francesco Mosca, who printed a formula for curing\r\nthe plague, was honourably entitled _Protomedico_. A nun prophesied\r\nthat the building of a convent on the hill of St. Martin for her\r\nsisterhood would bring to an end the pestilence. The building was taken\r\nin hand in eager haste, rich and poor vying in bodily labour, but in\r\nspite of all their efforts the mortality grew apace. By a strange\r\nperversity of reasoning penitential processions paraded both day and\r\nnight the very streets in which priests, in terror of the contagion,\r\nwere administering the Sacrament on the end of a stick. The death-roll\r\nof six months was 400,000 lives. Various writers have described this\r\nplague, among them Muratori, Giannone, and de Renzi in his _Naples\r\nin the year 1656_, published in 1667. The Papal Nuncio in Naples at\r\nthe time thought fit to write a pamphlet on it, and of modern writers\r\nShorthouse has made poor use of it in his _John Inglesant_.\r\n\r\nMicco Spadara (1612-79), who actually witnessed this plague, has left\r\na picture of it, which is now in the National Museum at Naples. It\r\nrepresents the Piazza Mercatello, a veritable pandemonium of dead\r\nand dying. _Monatti_, drawn from the galley-slaves, are dragging the\r\ncorpses with hooks to carts in which to carry them to the burial-pits.\r\nHere and there sedan chairs are seen. These were used to carry the\r\nsick to the lazarettos. At first chair-bearers were selected from\r\nthe citizens who volunteered for the task, but when all these were\r\ndead, galley-slaves and convicts took their place. In the plague of\r\nMarseilles in 1720 sedans were put at the disposal of the doctors, ‘for\r\ntheir more easy conveyance everywhere’, by order of the Town Council.\r\n\r\nThere was plague in Rome as well as Naples in 1656. Nicolas Poussin\r\n(1594-1665) was resident in Rome, and has left the testimony of an\r\neye-witness in his picture, ‘The Plague of Rome,’ now in the Czernin\r\nCollection at Vienna. It is a landscape with architectural features, of\r\nwhich Denio[179] gives this brief notice: ‘Two men are seen dragging\r\na corpse to the mouth of a vault, whose opening is already barred by\r\ndead bodies. A man, enveloped in a white mantle, directs the bearers\r\nwhere to go: by his side is a jackal-like dog. On the high platform of\r\nthe receptacle we notice a group of six men. Broken columns take the\r\nplace of the half-seen trees in other works, while sarcophagi and tombs\r\nindicate a cemetery. Beyond the arch stretches the Campagna.’ Poussin\r\nhas introduced into the picture the Castle of S. Angelo, mindful, no\r\ndoubt, of the legend of Gregory’s vision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI PLAGUE OF NAPLES, 1656. BY MICCO SPADARA\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Brogi, Florence (Face Page 184)]\r\n\r\nThe church of Santa Maria in Campitelli at Rome was rebuilt, in its\r\npresent form, in 1659, by Carlo Rainaldi, to accommodate a miraculous\r\nimage of the Virgin, to which the cessation of the plague of 1656\r\nwas ascribed. The church is sometimes called S. Maria in Portico,\r\nbecause of the neighbouring Portico of Octavia. The miraculous Madonna\r\nis placed now beneath the canopy over the high altar. It is still\r\nbelieved to protect Rome from the contagion of pestilence. Here, too,\r\ncame constantly the Elder Pretender and his son Henry, who took his\r\nCardinal’s title from this church, to offer prayers to this self-same\r\nimage of the Madonna, for the liberation of England from the plague\r\nof Protestant apostasy. To this end James instituted in perpetuity an\r\noffice of prayer, and ordained that every Saturday Mass should be said\r\nat 11 of the morning before the picture, with the Sacrament exposed,\r\nand that after recital of the prayers a blessing should be given\r\nalong with the Sacrament. This ceremony has ever since been regularly\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\nIn the sacristy is a framed engraving of the miraculous Madonna, dated\r\n1747. It is surrounded by a series of small pictures, one of which\r\nshows the appearance of the image to S. Galla in the pontificate of\r\nJohn I (523-6), as she ministered to the wants of twelve poor men in\r\nher house. Another shows Pope John dedicating the miraculous picture in\r\nthe oratory of S. Galla, which was transformed later into the church\r\nof S. Maria in Campitelli. The remaining pictures represent scenes in\r\nsuccessive pontificates, in which this miraculous Madonna brought about\r\na cessation of plague. A brief explanation in Latin is attached to each.\r\n\r\nThe plague of 1656 occurred in the pontificate of Alexander VII. This\r\nPope did much to atone for the craven spirit of his papal predecessors\r\nby his courage and devotion to his people throughout the epidemic. It\r\nis surprising that no memorial has been erected to commemorate his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nTwo rare contemporary prints represent scenes in the course of this\r\nvisitation. One is figured by Lanciani in his _Golden Days of the\r\nRenaissance_:[180] the other is reproduced here.[181] Both were to be\r\nseen in the Medical Exhibition in the Castel S. Angelo in the spring\r\nof 1912. Lanciani’s print shows the following scenes:\r\n\r\n1. Inspection of the city gates by Prince Chigi.\r\n\r\n2. Barge-loads of corpses from the lazaretto on the island of S.\r\nBartolommeo.\r\n\r\n3-5. Various methods of fighting the plague in infected districts.\r\n\r\n6. The ‘Field of Death’ near St. Paul-outside-the-Walls.\r\n\r\nThe second print is of even greater interest than this: the first two\r\nrows of plates give some idea of the character of the lazarettos, and\r\nshow how they were guarded by palisades and sentries: they also show\r\nthe carts for transport of the sick attended by armed soldiers. The\r\ndisinfection of the books and personal ornaments of the sick, a dead\r\ndog being dragged away to be thrown into the river, and a sick-cart\r\nmarked with a cross, are other details of interest. The third row\r\nindicates the removal of infected goods to places outside the city,\r\nwhere they were either washed or cleansed; places where other things\r\nwere deposited; a country residence of the Popes converted into a\r\nconvalescent home; and the ruined palace of the Antonines, where\r\nwoollen goods were taken for disinfection. The fourth row represents\r\nchiefly wash-houses and washing-places, to which clothes and bedding\r\nwere removed for cleansing. The fifth row, the execution of those who\r\ntransgressed the sanitary regulations, the shooting of sick criminals,\r\nand the various measures taken to restrict the river traffic. A cable\r\nis thrown across the river, and palisades are erected on the shores,\r\nso as to break all contact between the city and boats bringing in\r\nprovisions. The huts are shown, in which soldiers and officials were\r\nlodged, whose duty it was to compel obedience to the prescribed\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII PLAGUE SCENES IN ROME, 1656\r\n\r\nFrom an old engraving (Face Page 186)]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[176] Translated in _A Tragedy of the Great Plague of Milan_, R.\r\nFletcher, M.D. 1895.\r\n\r\n[177] Joshua vi. 26.\r\n\r\n[178] Deuteronomy xiii. 15-18.\r\n\r\n[179] Nicolas Poussin, p. 134.\r\n\r\n[180] p. 84.\r\n\r\n[181] From an engraving in the author’s possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Plague of London, which reached its height in 1665, has left\r\nan abundant aftermath both in literature and art. The main story of its\r\nravages is too well known to call for repetition.\r\n\r\nThere were still some ready to see in the plague, as they were in\r\nthe case of the fire, evidence of the handiwork of malevolent Jews.\r\nSince their expulsion from England by Edward I, the Jews had never yet\r\nobtained the legal right of re-entry, their open petition to Cromwell\r\nhaving failed. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne, they\r\nseem to have taken the matter into their own hands and found their\r\nway quietly back, so that at the time of the plague there were many\r\nresident in London, to the great advantage of trade and to the relief\r\nof an ever-needy Government. But three centuries of plague, punctuated\r\nby fierce outbreaks at regularly recurring intervals, had served to\r\nunravel much of the mystery of pestilence, and the people had learnt\r\nthat it was not to be exorcised by a holocaust of Jews, or by the\r\nbrutal murder of imaginary poisoners.\r\n\r\nCelestial portents were not lacking to presage the plague. A blazing\r\ncomet appeared for several months before the plague. Men affected to\r\nsee, in its dull colour and slow solemn movement, a prediction of the\r\nheavy punishment of pestilence; whereas that which preceded the fire\r\nwas swift and flaming and foretold a rapid retribution.\r\n\r\nSuperstition raked up images afresh from the scrap-heap of discarded\r\nfancies. Women saw flaming swords in the heavens, some even saw\r\nangels brandishing them over their heads. Astrologers had strange\r\ntales of malignant conjunctions of the planets. Medical opinion was\r\nstill divided along the same lines of cleavage, as it had been for\r\n2,000 years before. There were those who referred the disease to some\r\noccult poison, and those who referred it to an excess of some manifest\r\nquality, such as heat, or cold, or moisture, in each case corrupting\r\nthe body humours. Speculation was rife as to the nature of the causal\r\npoison. Some, as Lucretius had done, conceived it to be pestiferous\r\ncorpuscles of atomic character, outside the range of human vision,\r\ngenerated either in the heavens by a malignant conjunction of planets,\r\nor in the soil, and so often liberated by the agency of earthquakes.\r\nThese poisons, however generated, found their way into the human body\r\nthrough the medium of the distempered atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSome had noticed an unusual absence of birds before the epidemic, as\r\nThucydides and Livy had done in their times. Boyle observed a great\r\ndiminution of flies in 1665, Boghurst a superabundance of flies and\r\nants in 1664. Sir George Ent and others attributed the disease to\r\nminute invisible insects, but Blackmore conceived these to be rather a\r\nconsequence than a cause.\r\n\r\nInsects, so-called, had been vaguely associated with pestilence from\r\nremote antiquity, more especially flies, lice, and locusts; but in the\r\nmedical literature of the sixteenth century and after they are assigned\r\na much more definite role. Mercurialis[182] states that huge numbers of\r\ncaterpillars paraded the streets of Venice during the plague of 1576.\r\nGoclenus[183] mentions swarms of spiders during the plague of Hesse\r\nin 1612, and Hildanus swarms of flies and caterpillars this same year\r\nin plague-stricken Lausanne. Bacon speaks of flies and locusts, as\r\ncharacteristic of pestilential years, and Diemerbroeck[184] of flies,\r\ngnats, butterflies, beetles, grasshoppers, and hornets in the same\r\nconnexion. Gottwald[185] reported the presence of multitudes of spiders\r\nduring the plague of Dantzig in 1709. Arabian physicians considered\r\nthe putrefaction of swarms of dead locusts an important cause of\r\npestilence. Hancock,[186] as late as 1821, argued that locusts caused\r\nfamine by destroying the crops, and so prepared the way for human\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nTalismans, amulets, reliquaries, and all the stock-in-trade of\r\nmagic were in brisk demand among the populace. Quack vendors of\r\nantipestilential remedies innumerable effectively replaced physicians,\r\nmost of whom took refuge in flight. All honour to those who stood fast\r\nat their posts and reclaimed for medicine what Galen had renounced, the\r\ncaptaincy of its own soul. These are the men who had no fear for ‘the\r\npestilence that walketh in darkness or the arrow that flieth by day’:\r\n\r\n     1. Dr. Francis Glisson     } Presidents of the Royal College\r\n     2.

Edward Higgs    }\r\n\r\nAnd yet a few beside these, whose names are inscribed on no human\r\ndocument, but whose deeds are imprinted in imperishable type on the\r\ndeathless record of righteous human endeavour.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Hodges[187] shows us something of the daily life of a\r\nphysician in the course of this plague. He himself rose early, took his\r\nantipestilential dose, attended to the affairs of his household, and\r\nthen repaired to his consulting room, where crowds awaited him. Some,\r\nwho were sick, he treated, others he reassured and sent away. Breakfast\r\nfollowed, then visits to patients at their homes. On entering a house\r\nhe would vaporize some aromatic disinfectant on a charcoal brazier:\r\nif he arrived out of breath, he would rest a while, and then place\r\na lozenge in his mouth, before proceeding to the examination of his\r\npatients. After a round of several hours’ duration, he would return\r\nhome, drink a glass of sack, and then dine on roast meat and pickles or\r\nsome similar condiments, all of which were reputed antidotal. More wine\r\nfollowed the preliminary curtain-raiser. Afternoon and evening, till\r\neight or nine o’clock, were devoted to a second round of visits. His\r\nlate hours he spent at home, a stranger to noxious fumes of tobacco,\r\nquaffing sack, to ensure cheerfulness and certainty of sleep. Twice the\r\nfatal infection seemed to have slipped past his outposts, but Hodges\r\nhad still his remedy: he merely doubled the dose.\r\n\r\nOf all the literature of pestilence none has been more widely read than\r\nDefoe’s _Journal of the Plague Year_: all later records take their\r\ncolour from Defoe. Nevertheless, a careful study and comparison of\r\nother contemporary accounts leaves little room for doubt that Defoe’s\r\npicture does not accurately represent the general state of London\r\nduring the plague. His picture is far more true of Marseilles in 1720\r\nthan of London in 1665, and in this connexion one should remember that\r\nhe had sedulously collected materials for a diary of the plague of\r\nMarseilles, which have been printed in some editions of his works.\r\nThese can hardly have failed to colour his _Journal_, which was not\r\nsubmitted to the public till 1722, two years after the plague of\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nDefoe himself was but six years old at the time of the plague, so that\r\nhis own childish memories can have aided him but little in his task. He\r\nwill have had, at most, a dim recollection of some hideous catastrophe,\r\nround which ranged tales of parents and friends in his boyhood. To\r\nthese he will have added facts and incidents borrowed from the chief\r\nrecords available in print. Intrinsic evidence goes to show that these\r\nwere three: London’s _Dreadful Visitation_, Hodges’s _Loimologia_, and\r\nVincent’s _God’s Terrible Voice in the City_. The first of these will\r\nhave given him the Bills of Mortality and other general information:\r\nthe second, the aspect of the plague from a physician’s point of view:\r\nthe third, a vision of the plague as it appealed to popular imagination.\r\n\r\nThat Defoe intended to write history and not fiction, there is no\r\nreason to doubt. Judged only by the accuracy of his facts it is\r\nhistory, but it is in the facts that he omits, just because he had\r\nnever heard of them, that he unconsciously lapses into fiction.\r\nComparison of details and incidents with the unimpeachable record of\r\nPepys confirms his accuracy, but it shows also that, by separating\r\nincidents from their surroundings and by compressing his description\r\nto the exclusion of all but selected incidents, the picture, as a\r\nwhole, does not accurately represent the aspect of the city, as it\r\nwas. Pepys, who was an actual eye-witness, has noted not only the most\r\nstriking events but those of everyday commonplace interest, so that\r\nhis narrative is far more true to life. Defoe, on the other hand, has\r\nremoved his picture from its setting. Pepys shows us that, though the\r\nspectre of plague was everywhere, everyday life went on, though in\r\nsubdued fashion. Defoe would have us believe that all activity was\r\nparalysed.\r\n\r\nFor all this, however, as one reads the _Journal_ the narrative has\r\nsuch an air of verisimilitude, that one instinctively pictures the\r\nwriter as describing what he has seen with his own eyes, so perfect is\r\nthe illusion. Mead, indeed, himself an authority on the plague and so\r\nsoon after the event, believed that the _Journal_ was the authentic\r\nrecord of an eye-witness. Defoe’s faculty of visualizing what he has\r\nnot seen is inferior only to the vividness with which he describes what\r\nhe has visualized.\r\n\r\nWhat is the secret of this vividness? More than all else, extreme\r\nsimplicity of language. The simple style was Defoe’s natural style,\r\nand for that reason his use of it is fluent and easy, and knowing this\r\nhe fitly puts his story into the mouth of a simple saddler. Defoe\r\nwrote for a growing class of readers of a lowly social order. He is\r\nthe apostle of the common people: that is why he imitates their way of\r\nspeaking. Not only is his narrative colloquial, but it deliberately\r\naffects the language a saddler would use in reciting to his intimates\r\nthe memories of what he had lived through. There is no striving for\r\ndramatic effect, no drawing of lurid pictures, no literary artifice,\r\nbut always the same sustained simplicity of diction, even in describing\r\nthe most appalling occurrences. There must be no chance of missing\r\nthe smallest point, so he even does such thinking as is necessary by\r\nrunning comments on his own story.\r\n\r\nThe educated reader, particularly in these days, when even literature\r\nis administered in tabloid form, must needs be wearied by the\r\nprolixity, and irritated by the redundancy of the narrative. But\r\nagain it must be pleaded in extenuation that these very defects are\r\ndeliberate. Constant repetition, as every teacher knows, sooner or\r\nlater penetrates the densest brain.\r\n\r\nBut the _Journal_ is something more than a mere chronicle, vivid enough\r\nat that, of what happened, and how men behaved, during the plague.\r\nDefoe regards the plague as the judgement of God, and this attitude\r\nimparts a strong moral purpose to the work. This is why he dwells so\r\nmuch on the mental and moral effects of the catastrophe, inculcating\r\nhis lesson without the appearance of undue insistence. Pepys, as\r\nwe know, could find heart to make merry during the plague, just as\r\nBoccaccio depicted his company of Florentines: to Defoe the mere idea\r\nof merriment is revolting. Pepys, on New Year’s Eve, as he looked\r\nback over the abomination of desolation, could make this entry in his\r\n_Diary_:\r\n\r\n      ‘December 31, 1665. I have never lived so merrily\r\n    (besides that I never got so much) as I have done this\r\n    plague time ... and great store of dancings we have\r\n    had at my cost (which I am willing to indulge myself\r\n    and wife) at my lodgings. The great evil of this year,\r\n    and the only one indeed, is the fall of my Lord of\r\n    Sandwich, whose mistake about the prizes hath undone\r\n    him.’\r\n\r\nPepys was a stranger to imagination: his pleasures and his griefs were\r\nthings of the surface and matters of the moment. His creed is egoistic\r\nhedonism in all its naked brutishness. He is far more concerned over\r\nthe fire, where there is a chance of losing his property, than over\r\nthe plague where the chance is of losing his life. His New Year’s Eve\r\nretrospect is not the only glimpse he gives us of callous indifference\r\nto the horrors of the plague. Look at September 30, 1665, when the\r\nfiercest spell was only just past:\r\n\r\n      ‘So to sleep with a good deal of content, and saving\r\n    only this night and a day or two about the same\r\n    business a month or six weeks ago, I do end this month\r\n    with the greatest content, and may say that these\r\n    three months, for joy, health, and profit, have been\r\n    much the greatest that ever I received in all my life,\r\n    having nothing upon me but the consideration of the\r\n    sicklinesse of the season during this great plague to\r\n    mortify mee. For all which the Lord God be praised!’\r\n\r\nIt was not that Pepys was unconscious of the terrible scenes of\r\nsuffering around him, only that he was unmoved by them. Into one short\r\nletter to Lady Cartaret, at the height of the plague, he compresses all\r\nthe grim details that fill a volume for Defoe.\r\n\r\nHistorians frequently lay it down that the fire of London swept away\r\nthe plague. As a fact it probably had little to do with its departure.\r\nSeveral English towns were as hard hit as London, and yet in the\r\nabsence of any conflagration subsidence and disappearance of plague\r\nfollowed the same course as in London. At Salonica,[188] about A.D.\r\n1500, a fire which destroyed 8,000 houses was actually followed by\r\nan outbreak of plague. It was a common contemporary belief that the\r\ndeparture of plague from London was hastened by the coming of pit-coal\r\ninto general use, so that the atmosphere was constantly permeated by\r\nsulphurous fumes.\r\n\r\nRecords in art of the Great Plague of London, though numerous, are\r\nmostly unimportant. Generally artists have been content to illustrate\r\nits copious literature. In 1863 Frederic Shields commenced an intended\r\nseries of illustrations of the _Journal_ of Defoe. Ruskin lavished\r\ngreat praise on the woodcuts, for their imaginative power and for the\r\nsuperlative excellence of the design. Proofs of six of these woodcuts\r\nwere to be seen at the Memorial Exhibition of the works of Shields\r\n(Alpine Club, September-October 1911). The set of six comprised the\r\nfollowing scenes:\r\n\r\n          1. _The Decision of Faith_\r\n    A man is seated at a table, on which lies a Bill of\r\n    Mortality, with his Bible open before him. He says to\r\n    himself, ‘Well I know not what to do, Lord direct me.’\r\n    His finger points to the answer in the open Bible:\r\n    ‘Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge,\r\n    even the most High, thy habitation: there shall no evil\r\n    befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy\r\n    dwelling.’\r\n\r\n          2. _The Death of the First-born_\r\n    A youth lies in convulsions on a bed, while a woman\r\n    kneels beside it. In the background are bearers\r\n    carrying away a corpse: both are smoking pipes. On the\r\n    ground lies an hour-glass.\r\n\r\n          3. _Solomon Eagle warning the Impenitent_\r\n    Solomon Eagle stands with a brazier of live coals on\r\n    his head in a fierce preaching attitude before a group\r\n    of lewd young women at an open window.\r\n\r\n          4. _The End of a Refugee_\r\n    A man with a long hooked pole is dragging a corpse\r\n    along. Beside him stands a grave-digger with spade,\r\n    dog, and dinner-basket.\r\n\r\n          5. _The Plague-Pit_\r\n    Bodies are being shot from a cart into a pit by the\r\n    light of a torch, which a man is holding.\r\n\r\n          6. _Escape of an Imprisoned Family_\r\n    The door of a house has been hacked down, and is lying\r\n    on a dead body.\r\n\r\nGeorge Cruickshank contributed four plates to Brayley’s edition of\r\nthe _Journal of the Plague Year_. Three of them, the ‘Dead Cart’, the\r\n‘Great Pit in Aldgate’, and ‘Solomon Eagle’ are vivid and powerful; the\r\nfourth, ‘The Water-man’s Wife’, feeble and commonplace.\r\n\r\nThe preaching of Solomon Eagle is the subject of a picture by P. F.\r\nPoole, R.A., in the Mappin Gallery at Sheffield. The scene depicted\r\nis taken from Harrison Ainsworth’s novel _Old Saint Paul’s_. It shows\r\nSolomon Eagle, with the brazier of live coals on his head, nude but for\r\na loin-cloth; and discoursing to the terrified citizens outside old St\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, during the plague. All around are strewn bodies of\r\ndead and dying: a house displays the damning red cross and the words\r\n‘Lord have mercy upon us’. In the background bearers are carrying away\r\na corpse to burial.\r\n\r\nAn incident, that Pepys describes in his _Diary_ under September 3,\r\n1665, as follows, is represented in a modern picture by Miss Florence\r\nReason.\r\n\r\n      ‘Among other stories, one was very passionate,\r\n    methought, of a complaint brought against a man in\r\n    the towne for taking a child from London from an\r\n    infected house. Alderman Hooker told us it was the\r\n    child of a very able citizen in Gracious Street, a\r\n    saddler, who had buried all the rest of his children\r\n    of the plague, and himself and his wife now being shut\r\n    up and in despair of escaping, did desire only to save\r\n    the life of this little child: and so prevailed to have\r\n    it received stark-naked into the arms of a friend, who\r\n    brought it (having put it into new fresh clothes) to\r\n    Greenwich; where, upon hearing the story, we did agree\r\n    it should be permitted to be received and kept in the\r\n    towne.’\r\n\r\nIn 1679 a terrible epidemic of plague broke out in Vienna, then an\r\nopulent city, with a population of some 210,000, and the seat of\r\nLeopold, the Holy Roman Emperor. Our chief knowledge of the visitation\r\nis derived from Sorbait (_Consilium medicum oder freundliches\r\nGespräch_), Abraham a St. Clara (Merk’s _Wien_), and Fuhrmann (_Alt-\r\nund Neu-Wien_). The disease was preceded by an epidemic of the ‘Hot\r\nSickness’, (_Hitzige Krankheit_), which was very fatal. Bubonic plague\r\nfollowed in its wake and Vienna presented the spectacle of one huge\r\nlazaretto for the sick, one gigantic plague-pit for the dead. Convicts,\r\nas at Naples, were employed both to nurse the sick and bury the dead.\r\nClothing, furniture, and bedding lay littered in the streets mixed\r\nwith the dead and dying. When carts failed, the bodies were thrown\r\ninto the Danube. A Plague Committee strove in vain to shut up all\r\ninfected houses and segregate the inmates in lazarettos and stations of\r\nquarantine. Death by public hanging was the penalty of disobedience.\r\nSome of the royal princes, and foremost among them Prince Ferdinand of\r\nSchwartzenburg, together with many of the nobility, devoted themselves\r\ncourageously to fighting the plague, undertaking even the most menial\r\nduties. But many of the citizens and the Emperor himself fled. Leopold\r\nconceived his obligations to his people discharged by a pilgrimage to\r\nMaria-Zell to pray for cessation of the plague. Then he moved his court\r\nto Prague, whence plague drove him to Linz.\r\n\r\nDuring the plague the Viennese set up a wooden column, to which\r\nfrequent processions were made, observing the ancient ritual of the\r\nFlagellants. At the end of the plague Leopold made a vow at St.\r\nStephan’s to replace it by a marble column, which was duly erected in\r\nthe Graben between 1687-93.\r\n\r\nAn incident of this plague, the story of the street-singer Augustin,\r\nwho was thrown alive, but drunk, into the plague-pit, but escaped none\r\nthe worse for his experience, recalls the like occurrence in Defoe. The\r\nman is said to have composed the familiar ‘O du lieber Augustin’ in a\r\nbeer-house on the very night he was thrown into the plague-pit.\r\n\r\nAmulets of various kinds were extensively employed in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In South Germany a common form was the so-called Pest Penny.\r\nThese had on one face, as a rule, the figure of St. Benedict or St.\r\nZacharias, and on the reverse some formula of exorcism.\r\n\r\nVienna[189] fell a victim to outbreak after outbreak of plague, but the\r\nexperience gained in the visitation of 1679 enabled the authorities to\r\nstamp out the infection in 1691 and 1709, before it had grown out of\r\nhand. But in 1713 all preventive measures failed to check its spread.\r\nThen, in the month of May, processions and litanies were organized\r\nto the plague column. The Emperor Charles VI remained in Vienna, and\r\npronounced a solemn vow in St. Stephan’s, that if the plague ceased he\r\nwould erect a church as a thank-offering. Such was the origin of the\r\nKarlskirche. This church is a rich square edifice with a huge dome. It\r\nis the _chef-d’œuvre_ of J. B. Fischer von Erlach, commenced in 1715.\r\nThe ravages of the plague are portrayed in relief, by Stanetti, in the\r\ntympanum. Flanking the portico are two domed belfries, resembling\r\nTrajan’s column, 108 feet high, with reliefs from the life of S. Carlo\r\nBorromeo by Mader and Schletter. In March 1714, when the plague died\r\nout after a total mortality of 120,000, a thanksgiving _Te Deum_ was\r\nsung in St. Stephan’s, at which the emperor was present. Two series\r\nof memorial coins were struck, the one showing the votive column, the\r\nother the church dedicated to S. Carlo Borromeo.\r\n\r\nThe Plague Regulations, published in separate form at Vienna at the\r\ntime of this epidemic, give a good idea of current popular opinion\r\nas to the nature of plague. There was no lack of adherents for each\r\nbelief of every preceding period. There were those who regarded it as a\r\nsignal evidence of God’s displeasure. There were those who attributed\r\nit to poison in the air or food, generated in the stars and spread by\r\nthe malice of grave-diggers for their own purposes. Even the Jews were\r\nincriminated. There were those who read its origin in the conjunction\r\nof certain stars. Others ascribed it to famines, to poisonous fumes set\r\nfree by earthquakes, to comets, and even to dry seasons through the\r\nmultiplication of insects. Come how it might, clouds taking the form\r\nof biers and funeral processions, noises in churchyards, and dreary\r\nsounds in the air foretold its coming. On infected bodies the virus was\r\noften visible as blue sulphurous fumes. There were clearly also some\r\nwho conceived a natural origin. A doctor, named Gregorovius, dissected\r\nthree dead bodies in search of the cause, but failed to find it. His\r\nintrepid zeal was duly rewarded by the Emperor and by the Faculty of\r\nMedicine in Vienna.\r\n\r\nConformably with the varying conceptions of cause, remedies were varied\r\nand multifarious. Some pinned their faith to a devout life, aided by\r\nprocessions and penitential sermons. Some lit fires to cleanse the air,\r\nat times adding sulphur. A host of herbs, chief among them Angelica,\r\nenjoyed repute as antipestilential remedies. The simple life appealed\r\nto some, purgatives and blood-letting to others.\r\n\r\nBut side by side with this ill-assorted medley of measures, a code\r\nof sanitary precautions had slowly grown up. Early notification by\r\nthe doctors, quarantine of suspects and segregation of the sick,\r\ncleanliness and disinfection were all recommended and sedulously\r\nexecuted, and supplied in embryo the essential principles of modern\r\nsanitary science. Doctors were enjoined to keep sober, to fumigate\r\nthemselves, and to wear silk or taffetas, to which the virus would\r\nnot cling. We have arrived indeed at the parting of the ways, and\r\nhenceforth the stream of medical science, polluted less and less by\r\nthe surface waters of superstition, flows on clear and full in its\r\nappointed channel. The sun of science emerges at length from its\r\nprotracted winter solstice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[182] _De Peste._\r\n\r\n[183] _De Peste._\r\n\r\n[184] _De Peste._\r\n\r\n[185] _Reports to Royal Society._\r\n\r\n[186] _Researches into the Laws and Phenomena of Pestilence._\r\n\r\n[187] _Loimologia, and Dict. of Nat.

It was believed to\r\nhave been brought by a ship, the _Grand-Saint-Antoine_, which arrived\r\non May 25 from the Levant. As usual, the attempt was made to hush it up\r\nfor the sake of trade. At the beginning of August something had to be\r\ndone, so on the advice of two physicians, Sicard, father and son, it\r\nwas decided to light bonfires throughout the city. For lack of firewood\r\nthis was not done, but also for lack of faith, for it was found that\r\ndespite their vaunted specific, the Sicards had fled the city. So\r\nsulphur was served out to the poor instead, wherewith to ‘perfume’\r\ntheir houses.\r\n\r\nAs early as August 2 the Town Council found it necessary to adopt\r\nspecial measures to keep physicians and surgeons to their task.\r\nAccordingly, they decided that the city should pay them a fixed\r\nsalary in place of fees from the sick, and allow them smocks of oiled\r\ncloth, and sedan chairs to carry them on their rounds. There are\r\nseveral illustrations extant of the dress adopted by doctors in the\r\nplague of Marseilles. The same dress, with trifling variations, was\r\nworn elsewhere in France, in Switzerland, and in Germany, and had\r\noriginated in Italy. It is shown in an old Venetian woodcut of A.D.\r\n1493, from the works of Joannes de Ketham (_Fasciculus Medicinae_,\r\n1493). This woodcut shows a physician in a long overall, but wearing\r\nonly a skull-cap on his head, visiting a plague patient in bed. He is\r\naccompanied by attendants who carry lighted torches, while he himself\r\nholds a medicated sponge before his mouth and nose, as he feels the\r\npulse. Grillot figured the dress as the frontispiece of his _Lyon\r\naffligé de la peste 1629_, and Manget[190] has borrowed it from him.\r\nFrom his description it would seem that the mantle, breeches, shirt,\r\nboots, gloves, and hat were all of morocco leather. The beak attached\r\nto the mask was filled with aromatics, over which the air passed in\r\nrespiration, and had an aperture for each eye, fitted with a disk of\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, 1. DRESS OF A MARSEILLES DOCTOR, 1720]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII, 2. GERMAN CARICATURE OF THE SAME\r\n\r\n(Face Page 200)]\r\n\r\nM. Reber[191] describes an engraving by John Melchior Fuesslin,\r\nrepresenting a doctor in the plague of Marseilles. The legend beneath\r\nit, in German, is (translated) ‘Sketch of a Cordovan-leather-clad\r\ndoctor of Marseilles, having also a nose-case filled with smoking\r\nmaterial to keep off the plague. With the wand he is to feel the\r\npulse.’ Reber’s and Manget’s plates are both reproduced in the Bristol\r\n_Medico-Chirurgical Journal_, March 1898, from the _Janus_ blocks.\r\nGaffarel[192] gives the costumes both of a doctor and of a hospital\r\nattendant: they closely resemble the dress of the Italian charitable\r\nguilds of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nBy August 9 some of the physicians and almost all the master-surgeons\r\nhad fled, and an ordinance was issued demanding their return, or in\r\ndefault their expulsion from their respective corporations, and other\r\nspecial penalties as well. Two physicians named Gayon volunteered\r\ntheir services for the Hôpital des Convalescents, but forthwith paid\r\nthe penalty with their lives. In the absence of sufficient physicians\r\nin Marseilles, others were summoned from Montpellier, Paris, and\r\nelsewhere. These exhausted their energies in a dispute over the\r\ncontagious character of plague. Chicoyneau and Chirac maintained that\r\nit was not contagious. Deidier proved, by successfully inoculating\r\ndogs with bile taken from plague subjects, that at any rate it was\r\ncommunicable. Each subsequently expounded his views in a formal\r\ndiscourse before the School of Montpellier.\r\n\r\nExisting hospital accommodation was quite unequal to the needs.\r\nEmergency tents were erected outside the town, with mattresses for the\r\nsick. Chevalier Rose equipped and maintained a hospital in the district\r\nentrusted to him, at his own expense. A large temporary hospital of\r\ntimber covered with sail-cloth was hurriedly erected, but when almost\r\nfinished towards the end of September it was blown down by a gale,\r\nand was not rebuilt till October 4. This hospital, together with\r\nthe Hôpital Général de la Charité of 800 beds, provided ultimately\r\nsufficient accommodation, so that none need remain in the streets.\r\n\r\nFrom the first the mortality was such that it was wellnigh impossible\r\nto bury the dead. On August 8 the Assembly resolved that carts should\r\nbe used to carry the dead to burial, and that pits should be dug in\r\nwhich the bodies could be buried in lime. So two huge pits were dug\r\noutside the walls, between the gate of Aix and that of Joliette, M.\r\nMoustier overseeing the diggers and compelling them to work. Chevalier\r\nRose also had pits dug and organized a corps of buriers in his own\r\ndistrict. The duties of burial were at first entrusted to sturdy\r\nbeggars, but in a brief space of time the supply of these failed,\r\nso that bodies began to accumulate in the houses and streets. Then\r\nconvicts were requisitioned in relays from time to time.\r\n\r\nThese convicts were promised their liberty, to excite them to work—a\r\npromise that was never fulfilled in the case of the few who survived\r\nthe task. Their ignorance of the management of carts and horses, their\r\nidleness and lust of robbery rendered them so unfit for the task, that\r\nMoustier and the other sheriffs and Chevalier Rose were compelled to\r\nbe always present on horseback, to superintend the work. By August 21\r\ncorpses had already begun to accumulate in old parts of the city, where\r\nthe streets were too narrow and steep for the carts to go. Accordingly,\r\nan order was issued that the vaults of the churches in the upper town\r\nshould be used for burials in quicklime, and that, when full, they\r\nshould be sealed up with cement. By the end of August the streets\r\nwere literally strewn with dead bodies, some in an advanced stage of\r\nputrefaction, mingled with cats and dogs that had been killed, and\r\nbedding thrown out from the houses. The square in front of the building\r\ncalled the Loge, as also the Palissadoes of the port, were filled with\r\nbodies brought ashore from ships in the roadstead, to which whole\r\nfamilies had fled in the belief that plague would not reach them on the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nBy September 6 more than 2,000 dead bodies were lying in the streets,\r\nexclusive of those in the houses. On the esplanade called La Tourette,\r\nlying towards the sea between the houses and the rampart, 1,000 corpses\r\nhad lain rotting for weeks in the sun and emitting a frightful stench.\r\nThey were too rotten even to be lifted into carts, and too foul to be\r\ncarried to distant pits. Chevalier Rose, mindful maybe of Procopius,\r\nconceived the idea of throwing them into two huge vaults in the old\r\nbastions close to the esplanade, after breaking in their roofs. The\r\ntask was carried out in fierce haste by 100 galley-slaves, who tied\r\nhandkerchiefs dipped in vinegar over their mouths and noses. At the\r\nsame time fishermen netted 10,000 dead dogs floating in the port and\r\ntowed them out to sea.\r\n\r\nIn the parish of St. Ferriol, the finest quarter of the city, Michel\r\nSerre the painter undertook to see to the burial of the dead, with\r\ncarts and galley-slaves placed at his disposal, himself providing\r\nfood and lodging for the workers. A grateful city has repaid him by\r\nhanging his two large pictures of Marseilles during the plague close\r\nbeneath the ceiling of an underground cellar, where it is impossible to\r\ndecipher their details.\r\n\r\nWhen all the bodies were disposed of, the sheriffs employed the\r\ngalley-slaves to clear the filth from the streets and throw it into\r\nbarges, which carried it out to sea.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the epidemic, the sheriffs had forbidden the\r\nannual procession on August 16, in honour of St. Roch, at which the\r\nsaint’s bust and relics were carried through the streets; but the\r\npeople raised such an outcry that the procession was celebrated, the\r\nsheriffs attending with their halberdiers to prevent a crowd following.\r\nBy September 7 even the civil authorities had come to regard the plague\r\nas an instrument of God’s wrath, and the magistrates, to appease it,\r\nvowed that every year the city should give 2,000 livres to a House of\r\nCharity, to be established under the protection of our Lady of Good\r\nHelp, for orphans of the province.\r\n\r\nAt the height of the plague many parish priests and some of the monks\r\nfled: the services of the Church were mostly suspended. But many\r\nsecular clergy and monks remained and devoted themselves unflinchingly\r\nto the sick. The bishop, Belsunce, nobly played his part. Wherever the\r\npoorest lay, there he went confessing, consoling, and exhorting them\r\nto patience. To the dying he carried the Sacrament, to the destitute\r\nthe whole of his money in alms. Though plague invaded his palace and\r\ncarried off those about him, it spared him. It is of him that Pope[193]\r\nasks,\r\n\r\n    Why drew Marseilles’ good Bishop purer breath\r\n    When nature sickened, and each gale was death?\r\n\r\nOn All Saints’ Day, Belsunce headed a procession through the streets\r\nfrom his palace, walking barefoot, as Borromeo of old, with a halter\r\nabout his neck, and carrying the cross in his arms. He wished to appear\r\namong his people as a scapegoat laden with their sins, and as a victim\r\ndestined to expiate them. Accompanied by the priests and canons of\r\nthe Church he led the way to a place where an altar had been erected.\r\nThere, after exhorting the people to repentance, he celebrated Mass\r\nbefore them all. Then he solemnly consecrated the city to the Sacred\r\nHeart of Jesus, in honour of which he had instituted a yearly festival.\r\nThe tears coursing down his face as he spoke moved all to cry aloud to\r\nthe Lord for mercy. On November 16 Belsunce was emboldened to exorcise\r\nthe waning plague. Calling together all that remained of the clergy\r\nto the church of Acoulles, he read all the prayers that the Pope had\r\nprescribed for deliverance from plague. Then after an eloquent and\r\nmoving exhortation he carried up the Holy Sacrament to the cathedral’s\r\nroof, and there, under the open sky, with all the city lying before\r\nhim, uttered a solemn benediction, and performed the full ritual of\r\nexorcism according to the forms of the Roman Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nBelsunce was not the first human scapegoat to tread the streets\r\nof Marseilles in voluntary expiation for its people. In times of\r\npestilence, in the old Greek colony of Massilia, one of the lower\r\norders offered himself on behalf of his fellow citizens. Dressed in\r\nsacred garments and decked with sacred boughs he was led through the\r\nstreets, amid the prayers of the people that their ills might fall on\r\nhim, and then cast out of the city.\r\n\r\nThere stands this day on a lofty crest of land in the open square,\r\nright in front of the episcopal palace of Marseilles, a statue of\r\nBelsunce in bronze, by Ramus. The stone pedestal bears a commemorative\r\ninscription and two reliefs in bronze. In one, Marseilles in woman’s\r\nform is lying among her stricken children, while Belsunce and his\r\nattendant priests implore the Sacred Heart to stay the plague. In the\r\nother, Belsunce bears the Sacrament to sick and dying.\r\n\r\nThe statue of Belsunce, clad in full episcopal robes, stands with\r\nface raised and arms outstretched to heaven, in attitude of earnest\r\nsupplication. Before him Nature has set a landscape of surpassing\r\nbeauty: sea, earth, and sky give freely of their best. Far down below a\r\npolyglot people move hither and thither around the harbour quays, like\r\nants, at their appointed tasks. Beyond it spreads a matchless expanse\r\nof Mediterranean sea, now smooth and silvery as a mirror, now fretful\r\nwith the rising tide. Away over the sea and over the low land that\r\nbounds the bay, the evening sun lights up the face of Belsunce with\r\na last lingering radiance, as it goes down to its setting in a glory\r\nof golden hues. If man’s graven image may enjoy the perfect happiness\r\ndenied to man, then surely Belsunce has his reward.\r\n\r\nMarseilles is rich in reminiscence of her bishop. In the Bureau\r\nd’Intendance Sanitaire hangs a pleasing portrait of Belsunce by\r\nGobert; while in the Musée may be seen a poor picture, by Mansian,\r\nof him giving the Sacrament to the victims of the plague. François\r\nGérard (1770-1837) presented his ‘Peste de Marseille’ to the Bureau\r\nd’Intendance Sanitaire, where now it hangs. The wan dismal colouring of\r\nthe picture accords ill with the striking vigour of the composition. In\r\nthe foreground is set forth the whole tragedy of a family stricken with\r\nplague. On the ground lies the father writhing with agony: his hands\r\nare clenched, his eyes are starting from their sockets: the dressing in\r\nthe right armpit indicates one site of the disease. The mother, seated\r\non a chest, clasps to her body her elder boy, wrapped in a blanket,\r\ntoo weak to stand: the younger child leans against his mother, his\r\neyes fixed in terror on his dying father. Anguish is depicted in the\r\ndeath-like pallor of the mother’s face. In the background Belsunce in\r\nfull robes distributes to the sick and starving poor the bread which an\r\nattendant is carrying. To the left of the foreground bodies of the dead\r\nare lying huddled up beneath an awning, while to the right convicts\r\nare dragging corpses away for burial. The sublime serenity of the good\r\nbishop seems to bring to his stricken people in their anguish some\r\npromise of that peace which passeth all understanding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX (Face Page 206)\r\n\r\nPESTE DE MARSEILLE. BY FRANÇOIS GÉRARD\r\n\r\nPhotograph by Giraudon, Paris]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX LA PESTE DANS LA VILLE DE MARSEILLE EN 1720\r\n\r\nBy J. F. de Troy (Face Page 207)]\r\n\r\nJ. F. de Troy the younger (1679-1752), himself an eye-witness of this\r\nplague, painted a masterly picture, which is now in the city Musée. It\r\nwas executed for Chevalier Rose in 1722. It depicts him seated on a\r\nwhite horse calmly directing the work of the convicts, who have been\r\nassigned to him, as they clear the esplanade of La Tourette of the\r\naccumulation of decomposing corpses. The sheriffs, also on horseback,\r\naid the Chevalier in his task. The ground is strewn with corpses, which\r\nthe convicts seize and hurl into the gaping mouths of the open vaults\r\nin the bastions. They work in furious haste, impelled by the foul odour\r\nof the bodies and the knowledge of the hazard of their task. Ferocity\r\nis depicted in their faces, haste in all the movements of their bodies.\r\nThe whole scene is full of life and movement and spirit. In the sky\r\nhover angels shaking flaming torches. The colouring has been managed\r\nwith wonderful effect to convey the feeling that sky and earth alike\r\nare filled with a poisonous and sickly miasma.\r\n\r\nIn another picture in the Santé at Marseilles Guérin has treated the\r\nsame subject in a dull conventional manner. Chevalier Rose, bearing\r\nthe dead body of a woman, fills the centre of the picture. Behind him\r\na ludicrous boy is holding a white horse with one hand, and his nose\r\nwith the other, and is bestowing on his nose a tenacious grip that\r\nwould have been more appropriately bestowed on the horse. Convicts are\r\ndragging away the dead bodies that litter the ground.\r\n\r\nThe two large pictures by Michel Serre are of interest rather as\r\npictorial records of old Marseilles, than as contributions to the\r\nartistic presentation of plague. One represents the Cours de Marseille,\r\nnow known as the Cours Belsunce, during the plague. It is a handsome\r\nboulevard bordered on either side by trees, beneath which are seen\r\ntents hastily erected as temporary dwellings by those who have fled\r\nfrom their plague-contaminated dwellings to the shelter of the streets.\r\nDeath and disease have followed them and are rampant on every side.\r\nBuriers are seen collecting the dead and carrying them off in carts.\r\nThis picture has been engraved by Rigaud, and is figured in Crowle’s\r\n_Illustrated Pennant’s London_, vol. x, p. 93; also in Gaffarel’s _La\r\nPeste de 1720_, p. 304.\r\n\r\nThe other picture by Serre shows the open space in front of the Hôtel\r\nde Ville together with part of the port of Marseilles. The scenes\r\nresemble those of his other picture, and we are reminded also that\r\nmany took refuge in boats and anchored off the harbour, in the vain\r\nbelief that plague could not reach them there. The space before the\r\nTown Hall became one heap of decomposing bodies that were landed\r\nfrom the boats or had drifted ashore from the waters of the harbour.\r\nCrowle[194] figures this picture as well as the preceding, so, too,\r\ndoes Gaffarel.[195]\r\n\r\nWith the departure of plague from Marseilles, the disease had wellnigh\r\ndisappeared from Europe. In the Levant it still flourished for a while.\r\nPatrick Russell, physician to the British factory at Aleppo, wrote a\r\ntreatise on an epidemic that occurred during his residence there from\r\n1760-2. Again, in 1771 it gained a footing at Moscow, claiming there\r\nno less than 80,000 victims. It was in vain that the people thronged\r\nthe miraculous _ikon_ of the Virgin at the Varvarka gate. Fearing the\r\ngreat concourse, the archbishop had the _ikon_ removed to the Chudok\r\nmonastery, but such was the fury of the maddened people, that they\r\nthreatened to raze the building to the ground if the _ikon_ were not\r\nrestored. The archbishop yielded, but too late, for the mob dragged him\r\nfrom his monastery and massacred him in the open street. From that day\r\nthe plague began to wane. So plague was banished from Europe by the\r\nworship of a picture, and with dramatic appropriateness the curtain\r\nfell on the final act in a scene of human sacrifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI LES PESTIFÉRÉS DE JAFFA\r\n\r\nBy Baron Gros (Face Page 208)]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated picture ‘Les Pestiférés de Jaffa’ by Baron Gros, now\r\nin the Louvre, has been the subject of much acrimonious controversy.\r\nThe picture was ordered by Napoleon when First Consul, and excited\r\nextravagant enthusiasm on its exhibition in the Salon in 1804. Artists\r\nplaced a palm-branch over it, and the public covered the whole\r\nframe with wreaths. It is, in fact, a large unattractive canvas,\r\ndevoid of any exceptional merit either of composition or colour. It\r\nshows Napoleon accompanied by some of his staff standing among the\r\nplague-stricken soldiers in the interior of a mosque. One of the men\r\nis raising his right arm, so as to expose the bubo in his armpit, and\r\nNapoleon is laying his fingers on it.\r\n\r\nThere is also in existence a rough sketch,[196] which shows that Gros\r\nat the outset intended to present his subject differently. Napoleon,\r\nlike St. Louis in the modern fresco in St. Sulpice, holds in his arms\r\nthe body of a plague victim, which an Arab helps him to support. The\r\ngeneral’s impassive features contrast strongly with the frightened\r\nappearance of his attendants.\r\n\r\nEach of these two representations would seem to be actual historical\r\noccurrences during Napoleon’s campaign in Syria. Plague had broken\r\nout among the troops in Jaffa, where Napoleon had established a\r\nlarge hospital, and the generals had issued an alarming report as to\r\nits spread. It was Napoleon’s purpose to restore the _moral_ of his\r\narmy, which had been seriously affected by the outbreak. Norvin[197]\r\nrepresents Napoleon as visiting all the wards, accompanied by the\r\ngenerals Berthier and Bezzières, the director-general Daure, and the\r\nhead doctor Desgenettes. Napoleon spoke to the sick, encouraged them,\r\nand touched their wounds, saying, ‘You see, it is nothing.’ When he\r\nleft the hospital, they blamed his imprudence. He replied coldly, ‘It\r\nis my duty, I am the general-in-chief.’ This studied indifference to\r\nthe contagion, coupled with the fine behaviour of the head doctor\r\nDesgenettes, who inoculated himself with plague in the presence of the\r\nsoldiers and applied to himself the same remedies as he prescribed\r\nfor them, successfully accomplished Napoleon’s purpose. The account\r\nof the incident given in a letter[198] by Comte d’Aure is slightly\r\ndifferent. It runs, ‘He did more than touch the buboes: assisted by a\r\nTurkish orderly, General Buonaparte picked up and carried away a plague\r\npatient, who was lying across a doorway of one of the wards: we were\r\nmuch frightened at his acting thus, because the sick man’s clothing\r\nwas covered with foam and the disgusting discharge from a broken bubo.\r\nThe general continued his visit unmoved and interested, spoke to the\r\nsick, and sought in addressing them with words of consolation, to\r\ndissipate the panic that the plague was casting on their spirits.’\r\nBourrienne,[199] Napoleon’s secretary, however, says, ‘I walked by the\r\ngeneral’s side, and I assert that I never saw him touch any of the\r\ninfected.’\r\n\r\nThe Duc de Rovigo in his _Memoirs_ practically corroborates the Comte\r\nd’Aure. He says: ‘In order to convince them by the most obvious proof\r\nthat their apprehensions were groundless, he desired that the bleeding\r\ntumour of one of his soldiers should be uncovered before him, and\r\npressed it with his own hands.’ Desgenettes and General Andréossy,\r\nwho were both present, confirm Rovigo and Comte d’Aure as against\r\nBourrienne.\r\n\r\nNapoleon’s secretary carries the narrative a stage further. He says\r\nthat only sixty of those in the hospital had plague, and that as\r\ntheir removal involved a risk of infecting the whole army, Napoleon\r\ndeliberated with his staff and the medical men, and decided to put them\r\nout of their misery by poison. Bourrienne says that he does not know\r\nwho administered the poison, but that there was no question of their\r\ndestruction. Bourrienne’s statements on any subject, as is generally\r\nrecognized, need careful sifting, but out of the mass of conflicting\r\ntestimony the plain fact would seem to emerge, that Napoleon did\r\nsuggest that the death of some seven or eight, who were bound to die,\r\nshould be accelerated, so that they might not infect the whole army.\r\nNapoleon himself, at St. Helena, did not deny this, and defended his\r\naction on the ground of humanity, stigmatizing the story of wholesale\r\npoisoning as an invention.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[190] _Traité de la Peste_, 2 vols., Genève, 1721; _Johns Hopkins\r\nHospital Bulletin_, August 1898.\r\n\r\n[191] _Janus_, 1897, p. 297; and _Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin_.\r\n\r\n[192] _La Peste de 1720_, p. 96.\r\n\r\n[193] _Essay on Man_, iv. 107-8.\r\n\r\n[194] vol. x, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[195] p. 214.\r\n\r\n[196] Richer, _L’Art et la médecine_.\r\n\r\n[197] _Histoire de Napoléon_, ed. 1834, vol. i, p. 354.\r\n\r\n[198] _Bourrienne et ses erreurs._\r\n\r\n[199] _Mémoires sur Napoléon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX[200]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statement of Thucydides, that all other diseases took on the\r\nsimilitude of the dominating pestilence, is one that reappears\r\nconstantly in the literature of epidemic disease. We have already noted\r\nthe frequent concurrence of plague and typhus, leading such acute\r\nobservers as Diemerbroeck and Sydenham to believe that the one disease\r\nmight be transformed into the other. The same close association of\r\nrelapsing fever and typhus was constantly noted, and we know now that\r\nthe explanation lies in the fact that each disease is transmitted by\r\nthe body-louse, as plague is transmitted by the flea. Bearing in mind\r\nthe close and constant association of these and other acute infectious\r\nfevers it is no matter for surprise that they should have been regarded\r\nas states and stages of one pestilential process, differing from one\r\nanother, not in kind, but only in degree. As Bacon says, ‘putrefaction\r\nrises not to its height at once.’\r\n\r\nThe acute, often abrupt, onset of the Athenian pestilence, with\r\nprofound depression, severe headache, and suffused conjunctivae, though\r\nmet with in a moiety of cases of plague, is eminently characteristic of\r\ntyphus. The striking appearance of the bloodshot eyeballs has led to\r\nmuch confusion between the two diseases.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the tongue and fauces inclines rather to the side of\r\ntyphus. In each disease the tongue is at first heavily coated with a\r\nthick white fur, and tends later to become dry and parched. But in\r\ntyphus there is a special tendency, as the disease advances, for the\r\ntongue to bleed from fissures at the edges. So frequently is this the\r\ncase, that this feature has been regarded as of diagnostic value in the\r\npresence of an outbreak of typhus. A boggy reddened appearance of the\r\nfauces is usual in typhus, and is seen also in a proportion of plague\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nUnnatural and even foetid breath may be met with in any acute\r\ninfectious fever, but foetor is in no way characteristic of any.\r\nDoubtless it was far more common in times when the alphabet of oral\r\nhygiene had not yet found acceptance as a necessary detail of medical\r\nregimen. Murchison describes the breath of typhus patients as foetid,\r\nand in addition it is well known that a repulsive odour may be given\r\noff from their bodies. Salius Diversus mentioned it three centuries\r\nago, and it has been a commonplace of many subsequent writers.\r\nCurschmann failed to detect it, and attributed its absence to the free\r\nventilation of the sick wards. A layman, as Thucydides was, might well\r\nascribe to the breath a foetor permeating the whole atmosphere around\r\nthe patient.\r\n\r\nSneezing has long been associated in popular tradition with plague,\r\nand an old legend refers the association to the plague of Rome at the\r\ncommencement of the pontificate of Gregory the Great, when it is said\r\nthat those who sneezed died. The most careful and observant of modern\r\nphysicians do not, however confirm the connexion. Russell states that\r\nhe was on the look out for it during the plague of Aleppo and did\r\nnot observe it: Simpson does not even mention it. Nor does it appear\r\nto be noteworthy as a symptom either of typhus or of any other acute\r\ninfectious fever, though it would be in accord with the swollen and\r\ncongested state of the nasal mucosa in typhus, to which Curschmann\r\nhas drawn special attention. Perhaps the tradition is a mere old\r\nwives’ tale, for sneezing has been regarded as an ominous sign from\r\ngreat antiquity, and as far back at least as the composition of the\r\n_Odyssey_. Aristotle frankly confessed himself unable to explain the\r\nconnexion.\r\n\r\nCurschmann met with hoarseness and laryngeal catarrh commonly in\r\ntyphus, but though catarrh of the whole respiratory tract may occur\r\nin plague, it is not an outstanding feature. Cough is frequent in\r\neither disease; so also is vomiting, often of great severity: and if\r\nprotracted will exhibit a succession of changes of colour, such as\r\nThucydides has described, first the food contents of the stomach, then\r\ngreen bilious vomit, and finally blood, either red or altered to brown\r\nor black. Hiccough and empty retching are liable to ensue on severe\r\nvomiting from any enduring cause.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear to what Thucydides appropriates the term σπασμός: the\r\ncontext would suggest that spasm of the diaphragm, such as accompanies\r\nprotracted vomiting, is indicated. But it may also signify true\r\nconvulsions, which are an occasional complication of both diseases.\r\nConvulsive tremor of the limbs, and indeed of the whole body, is\r\nhabitual at the height of typhus, and is not infrequent in plague.\r\n\r\nWe should naturally look to the appearance of the skin and of the\r\neruption to afford criteria for a sure diagnosis, but such is not\r\nthe case. True, there is a remarkable resemblance to Murchison’s\r\ndescription of the skin of typhus patients, in an English hospital.\r\n‘The face’, he says, ‘is often flushed. The flushing is general over\r\nthe entire face. It is never pink: sometimes it is reddish or reddish\r\nbrown, but more commonly it is of a dusky, earthy, or leaden hue: in\r\ngrave cases it may be livid.’ No corresponding appearance of the skin\r\nis to be seen in plague.\r\n\r\nThucydides has described the eruption as consisting of φλύκταιναι\r\nμικραὶ καὶ ἕλκη, words that have generally been rendered as ‘small\r\nblisters and ulcers’, and for this reason have been held to exclude\r\npositively a diagnosis of typhus fever. So certain a conclusion is\r\nhardly justified by the facts. Outbreaks of gangrenous dermatitis, in\r\nwhich multiple bullae or blisters, leaving an ulcerated base, have\r\nbroken out over the body surface, have been not uncommon features of a\r\ntyphus epidemic, and from their virulently contagious character such\r\noutbreaks would have been more prone to occur amid all the neglect\r\nand destitution of a beleaguered garrison. Murchison has described\r\nthe resulting appearances in the following words: ‘I have seen bullae\r\nfilled with light or dark fluid, or large pustules appear on various\r\nparts of the body during the progress of the fever. Stokes has observed\r\nbullae of this description followed after bursting by deep ulcers with\r\nsharp margins.’ But extensive ulceration such as this must inevitably\r\nhave left permanent scarring, at least as marked as the ‘pitting’\r\nproduced by small-pox, and we can hardly presume that this could have\r\nescaped the critical Greek eye of so keen an observer as Thucydides.\r\nThe whole question arises of the exact significance of the words ἕλκος\r\nand φλύκταινα.\r\n\r\nIn his treatise Περὶ Ἑλκῶν Hippocrates uses the term ἕλκος not only\r\nfor open wounds and ulcers, but also for burns, wheals, and wounds in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nHomer uses it for wounds of every kind. It so happens that the wounds\r\nof the _Iliad_ are almost all the open wounds produced by spear and\r\narrow, but Homer also uses it for the bite of a snake[201] and for the\r\nwound inflicted by lightning.[202]\r\n\r\nBion[203] uses it in consecutive lines for the wound caused by a spear,\r\nand in the generic sense:\r\n\r\n    Ἃγριον, ἄγριον ἓλκος ἔχει κατὰ μηρὸν Αδωνις,\r\n    μεῖζον δ’ ἁ Κυθέρεια φέρει ποτικάρδιον ἕλκος.\r\n\r\nAeschylus[204] and Sophocles[205] use it also in the wider sense, as in\r\n\r\n    πόλει μὲν ἕλκος ἕν τὸ δήμιον τυχεῖν\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n                                   τί γὰρ\r\n    γένοιτ’ ἄν ἕλκος μεῖζον ἤ φίλος κακός;\r\n\r\nThe inference to be drawn from these passages is that ἕλκος, although\r\nusually indicating an open wound, is used with no precise significance.\r\n\r\nThe same difficulty attaches to the word φλύκταινα. Though Hippocrates\r\nuses the word frequently, there is no single passage in which\r\nthe precise significance is clear beyond all doubt. He applies\r\nit to chilblains,[206] to an eruption on the skin of subjects of\r\nempyema,[207] to lesions appearing on the tongue in fatal septic cases,\r\nand so on. In one passage, in which he speaks of a φλύκταινα arising\r\nfrom rubbing the skin with vinegar, he seems to indicate a blister.\r\n\r\nThe first clear definition of the term we have is from the pen of\r\nCelsus, who defines it as a discoloured pustule that breaks and leaves\r\nan ulcerated base (‘genus pustularum, cum plures similes varis oriuntur\r\nnonnunquam maiores, lividae aut pallidae aut nigrae aut aliter naturali\r\ncolore mutato: subestque iis humor, ubi hae ruptae sunt, infra quasi\r\nexulcerata caro apparet’). There are several passages in Aristophanes,\r\nwhich indicate that he at any rate applied the term as we do to a\r\nblister lesion: but at the same time, there are other passages in\r\nwhich this exclusive use is by no means so sure. The lesion resulting\r\nfrom rowing[208] or carrying a lance[209] cannot well be other than\r\na blister. And there is a passage in the _Ecclesiazusae_,[210] which\r\nseems even clearer:\r\n\r\n                    ἀλλ’ ἔμπουσά τις\r\n    ἐξ ἁἵματος φλύκταιναν ἠμφιεσμένη,\r\n\r\n    ‘Some vampire bloated with blood like a blister.’\r\n\r\nThe image must be that of a vampire, so bloated with blood, that its\r\nbody seems actually enveloped in it, simulating a blood-blister.\r\n\r\nAristotle applies the term to the bite of a shrew-mouse, which would\r\npresumably produce a solid local swelling, and not a blister. Procopius\r\nuses φλύκταινα for the black cutaneous lesions of Oriental plague,\r\nknown nowadays as pustules: he says, too, that they were of the size\r\nof a lentil, but does not mention terminal ulceration. Procopius is so\r\nprecise in his medical terminology, that it is improbable he borrowed\r\nthe term from Thucydides without appreciating its exact significance:\r\nfar more likely he adopted it from the medical terminology of his day.\r\n\r\nThere is something to be said for appropriating the terms used by\r\nThucydides to the pustular lesions of Oriental plague. Many writers,\r\nancient as well as modern, have described the so-called pustules as\r\ncommencing in some cases as blisters and terminating in eroding ulcers.\r\nBut, on the other hand, we know nothing of epidemics of plague without\r\na considerable proportion of bubonic cases, while we do know from\r\nthe narrative of Procopius that plague has maintained its characters\r\nunchanged for 1,500 years. In an epidemic of plague, in which death\r\ndid not supervene till the seventh or ninth day the presence of buboes\r\nwould be the outstanding feature of the disease, and Thucydides does\r\nnot even mention them.\r\n\r\nAssuming that typhus fever also has maintained its characters\r\nunchanged, and that the external manifestations of the Athenian\r\npestilence were not of the exceptional type we have alluded to, but of\r\nthe type habitually associated with the disease, can it reasonably be\r\ncontended that the terms φλύκταινα and ἕλκη are applicable to these?\r\n\r\nMurchison says that ‘according to its colour, the eruption may be said\r\nto pass through three stages, viz. 1, Pale dirty pink or florid; 2,\r\nreddish brown or rusty; 3, livid or petechial’. In the first stage, it\r\nis generally admitted that except on careful observation, and in a good\r\nlight, the faint diffuse maculae (spots) are apt to escape detection,\r\nso that the impression is of a general suffusion of the skin—what in\r\nfact Thucydides terms ὑπέρυθρον.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage, the deeper coloration of the spots throws them\r\ninto relief as individual lesions against the paler background of\r\ngeneral suffusion of the skin. Can it be that this is indicated by the\r\nvague term φλύκταινα? Be it remembered that Thucydides was a layman,\r\ndescribing, as he says, the lesions of a hitherto unknown disease.\r\nEvery physician is well aware of the restricted terminology that the\r\nlaity possess for the description of multifarious lesions. Medicine\r\nitself is not exempt from the same confusion, for when physicians\r\nglibly speak of the subcutaneous haemorrhages of typhus as petechiae\r\nthey forget that the word throws back to _petigo_ (a scab).\r\n\r\nThere remains then for the third stage of the eruption—the\r\nhaemorrhagic stage—the term ἕλκος, a generic term applicable to almost\r\nany lesion, and having no philological affinity to the Latin _ulcus_,\r\nand the English ‘ulcer’, with which medical usage has confused it.\r\n\r\nReviewing, then, all the facts, it cannot be held that the description\r\nof the eruption, as given by Thucydides, is sufficient to negative a\r\ndiagnosis of typhus fever, which disease is otherwise depicted to the\r\nlife in all else that he says of its clinical course and characters.\r\n\r\nThucydides was so impressed with the intensity of the internal fever,\r\nthat he expected certainly to find a corresponding temperature of\r\nthe body surface: hence his surprise is obvious at finding it not\r\nexcessively hot. For all that, sufferers were ready to cast off\r\nevery shred of clothing, till they were naked, and longed to throw\r\nthemselves into cold water. Some did actually plunge into cisterns,\r\nbut no amount of water sufficed to slake their thirst. Procopius\r\nmentions this same fierce longing to fling themselves into water among\r\nthe plague victims of Byzantium, but raving delirium of this kind is\r\nfar more characteristic of typhus than of plague. Curschmann depicts\r\nthe fierce medley of wild ravings, mingled with frantic efforts at\r\nself-destruction, which give an unmistakable character to a ward of\r\ntyphus patients. Murchison, quoting from Bancroft, says: ‘Some leaving\r\ntheir beds would beat their keepers or nurses and drive them from\r\ntheir presence: others, like madmen, would run about the streets,\r\nmarkets, lanes, and other places: and some again would leap headlong\r\ninto deep waters.’ Intolerable restlessness and insomnia fill up the\r\ncup of misery to overflowing. Curschmann confirms the observation of\r\nThucydides, that typhus cadavers exhibit very little emaciation, but\r\nthis does not help to differentiate typhus from other acute fevers of\r\nequally brief duration.\r\n\r\nDeath commonly occurred on the seventh or the ninth day. One recognizes\r\nhere submission to the authoritative doctrine of critical days.\r\nHippocrates[211] defined them on the basis of equal and unequal numbers:\r\n\r\n    Equal—4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 28, 30, 48, 60, 80, 100.\r\n    Unequal—5, 7, 9, 11, 17, 21, 27, 31.\r\n\r\nTaking the mean of the numbers, the plague of Athens claimed its\r\nvictims for the most part about the eighth day of the disease. A layman\r\nwould hardly have had the opportunity, or indeed the inclination,\r\nto make an exact statistical computation, and in this fact perhaps\r\nlies this unexpected lapse of Thucydides into subservience to medical\r\northodoxy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the day of death in typhus fever, Curschmann says:\r\n‘When death is caused simply by the severity of the disease, it\r\noccurs usually in the middle or second half of the second week. A\r\nfatal termination before the ninth day, or as early as the fifth or\r\nsixth day, occurs only in the most severe forms of the disease, or\r\nin individuals with little resisting power.’ Now, not only was the\r\nAthenian pestilence severe in type, but there was also an almost\r\ncomplete absence of the nursing and medical regimen that will have\r\nserved to prolong the duration of cases, that have ultimately proved\r\nfatal, in recent epidemics. In plague death usually occurs between the\r\nsecond and sixth days, seldom later, and few patients survive to the\r\nseventh or ninth day without the appearance of buboes.\r\n\r\nIf the victims survived this period, the disease fastened on the bowels\r\nand produced violent ulceration (ἕλκωσις). Initial constipation,\r\nfollowed, as the disease develops, by diarrhoea, which is sometimes\r\nprofuse and intractable, is met with both in typhus and plague.\r\n\r\nThe disease began in the head and gradually passed through the whole\r\nbody. If the sufferer survived so long, it would often seize the\r\nextremities and make its mark, attacking the privy parts and fingers\r\nand toes. Some escaped with the loss of these and with the loss of\r\ntheir eyes. This terminal gangrene of the extremities is of frequent\r\noccurrence in typhus, but is rare in plague, and very rare in other\r\nacute infectious fevers. Curschmann says: ‘Many patients continue\r\nto suffer for some time after defervescence (of typhus fever) from\r\ngangrene of the ears, fingers, toes, tip of the nose, and skin of the\r\npenis and scrotum, arising during the febrile period.’ Gangrenous\r\nchanges around a carbuncle are occasional in plague, but not as an\r\nindependent affection of the extremities. Neglected plague buboes, even\r\nnowadays in Indian epidemics, do exceptionally become gangrenous, as\r\nthe result of an intercurrent erysipelas. Necrotic ulceration of the\r\neyeballs is well authenticated as a complication of typhus as well as\r\nof plague.\r\n\r\nSome recovered from the disease, but with complete loss of memory.\r\nThis again is a frequent consequence, usually temporary, but sometimes\r\npermanent, of typhus. According to Curschmann, ‘the patient’s\r\nrecollection of his illness is almost always very limited in severe\r\nor moderately severe cases. True psychoses appear to be rare during\r\nconvalescence. Mild melancholia and hallucinations are sometimes seen,\r\nand even mania has been observed.’\r\n\r\nThe combination of gangrene with mental symptoms inevitably suggests\r\nthe thought of ergotism (poisoning by a fungus of rye-grain), and\r\nRead and Kobert have expended much ingenuity in support of this\r\nhypothesis. One of the Athenian corn routes did actually tap the\r\nnorthern shores of the Euxine, and southern Russia has been one of the\r\nchief centres of epidemics of ergotism. But there is no need to invoke\r\nthis condition, to explain symptoms which are commonly encountered in\r\ntyphus, and no warrant either for so doing, seeing that the clinical\r\nfeatures of the visitation had little in common with ergotism. Kobert’s\r\ningenious arguments in favour of ergotism, superimposed on some other\r\nunidentified disease, merely substitute one _impasse_ for another.\r\n\r\nThucydides observes that one feature distinguished the Athenian\r\npestilence from ordinary diseases. Birds and beasts of prey, which feed\r\non human flesh, would not as a rule touch the bodies, but, if they did,\r\nthey died. In fact, the birds of prey disappeared altogether, and were\r\nnot to be seen either about the bodies or anywhere else. In the case of\r\nthe dogs this was particularly noticeable, because they live with man.\r\nThe paragraph is curiously involved, but contains three statements of\r\nfact:\r\n\r\n    1. That vultures were nowhere to be seen.\r\n    2. That dogs avoided the dead bodies, as a rule, but\r\n       that, when they did not, they took the disease.\r\n    3. That other animals, which feed on carrion, and\r\n       within the walls of Athens these can hardly have\r\n       been other than rats and cats, and possibly pigs,\r\n       were affected like the dogs.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence as to the effect on cattle, horses, sheep, and\r\ngoats, because all these had been removed to Euboea.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the disappearance of birds of prey before and during\r\noutbreaks of epidemic pestilence has been asserted again and again in\r\nliterature. Yet it is very doubtful if the observation rests on any\r\nsure evidence. Search has brought to light only one occasion on which\r\nthe truth of the fact has been deliberately tested, and then it was\r\ndirectly contradicted. Russell says that at the commencement of the\r\nplague of Aleppo, in which true plague was ushered in by typhus, no\r\ndesertion of birds was observed, and no mortality among cattle. The\r\nold-time fancy that pestilence engendered in the clouds distempered\r\nthe atmosphere almost necessarily involved the presumption that the\r\nfeathered inhabitants of the air would be the first to feel its ill\r\neffects. In the same way the belief that pestilence might reach the\r\natmosphere in the exhalations from marshes, led to similar fables\r\nattaching themselves to the marsh-dwelling frog. Aristotle alludes\r\nto the increased number of frogs in pestilential years, and Bacon\r\nand Horstius repeat his statement. These children of the marsh are\r\nconceived of as products of its undue activity. Horstius went so far as\r\nto assert the same of snails.\r\n\r\nLivy[212] clearly asserts the disappearance of vultures from Rome\r\nbefore and during the epidemic of 174 B.C. ‘Cadavera, intacta a canibus\r\net vulturibus, tabes absumebat: satisque constabat, nec illo, nec\r\npriore anno, in tanta strage boum hominumque vulturium usquam visum.’\r\n[Dead bodies rotted away, untouched by dogs and vultures: and it was\r\ngenerally agreed that no vultures were to be seen either in that or the\r\npreceding year in spite of so great a mortality of men and cattle.] In\r\nthis instance, then, it was not that they scented death from afar and\r\nheld aloof, but that they disappeared beforehand. If some undetected\r\nepizootic—say of rats—had preceded the outbreak among cattle and\r\nmen, the vultures may well have perished at the outset from feeding on\r\ninfected material.\r\n\r\nOther authors extend the observation to birds in general, and not only\r\nto birds of prey, as though their affection was truly epizootic. Thus\r\nSchenkius[213] says that in the plagues of 1505 and 1522 birds deserted\r\ntheir nests and young ones. Goclenius says the same of the plague of\r\n1612, and that they fell suddenly to the ground dead. Mercurialis\r\nsays that Venice was deserted by birds in 1576, and Short repeats\r\nthis of Dantzig in 1709. Diemerbroeck says that cage-birds died in\r\nthe epidemics of 1635 and 1636, and Sorbait records the same fact of\r\nthe Viennese pestilence of 1679. Most, if not all this succession of\r\nepidemics, were unquestionably true Oriental plague, with or without\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\nAt present there is very little evidence of any extensive affection\r\nof the lower animals by typhus. Mosler, many years ago, failed to\r\ncommunicate it to dogs by injecting fresh typhus blood into their\r\nveins, or by feeding them on fresh typhus excreta, although death\r\nwith typhoid symptoms followed, when the blood and stools had first\r\nbeen allowed to decompose. In the last few years experimenters have\r\nsucceeded in communicating the disease to various monkeys by the\r\nagency of lice, but dogs, rats, and guinea-pigs have hitherto proved\r\nrefractory to infection.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is abundant evidence of animal infection\r\nwith Oriental plague. Epizootics among rats and cats are well known.\r\nBoccaccio asserted the susceptibility of pigs, and Michoud confirmed\r\nthe observation in the Yunnan epidemic of 1893. Dogs, poultry, deer,\r\ncattle, monkeys, squirrels, and marmots have all been shown by various\r\nobservers to be prone to contagion.\r\n\r\nBefore accepting the evidence of Thucydides as to the disappearance of\r\nbirds as weighty evidence in favour of the presence of true plague,\r\none must consider the state of the country district around Athens,\r\ndevastated by fire and the sword, and denuded of all its stock, so as\r\nto offer no promise of sustenance to bird visitors. But even so, one\r\nis still confronted by his statement as to the domestic dogs, which\r\nare known to be susceptible to plague and not known to be susceptible\r\nto typhus.\r\n\r\nThucydides says that no one was attacked a second time, or if he\r\nwere the result was not fatal. Immunity of this kind, comparatively\r\ncomplete, is alike characteristic of typhus and plague: the question\r\nis one that has provoked considerable controversy right down to modern\r\ntimes. Both Curschmann and Murchison are agreed as to the extreme\r\nrarity of relapses and reinfections in typhus: curiously, Murchison\r\nhimself had two typical severe attacks.\r\n\r\nIn the case of plague, Alexander Massaria,[214] from his experience at\r\nVicenza, came to the conclusion that one attack rendered a man immune\r\nwith very few exceptions, but that a second attack might be mortal.\r\nMercurialis and Van Helmont were in agreement as to the rarity of\r\nsecond attacks. Diemerbroeck[215] recorded two cases of reinfection\r\nin the same year of the plague at Nymwegen, and several cases at an\r\ninterval of a few years. During the plague of Marseilles in 1720,\r\nvarious writers observed cases of reinfection, and relapse was also\r\nsaid to be frequent. In the plague of 1771 at Moscow, Samilowitz,\r\nprejudiced by his own advocacy of inoculation, denied the existence\r\nof reinfection, and suffered retribution for his dogmatism by three\r\nrelapses in his own person. In the same plague both Mertens and Orraeus\r\nrecorded cases of reinfection. In the plague of Aleppo, Russell noted\r\n28 cases of reinfection within three years among 4,400 victims of\r\nplague. Thus the idea of complete immunity, so prevalent popularly both\r\nin Europe and the Levant, must be accepted with some reservation.\r\n\r\nOXFORD: HORACE HART M.A. PRINTER TO THE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] Curschmann’s contribution, in Nothnagel’s _Encyclopaedia of\r\nPractical Medicine_, is perhaps the most graphic and succinct account\r\nof Typhus Fever in modern medical literature. The record of Thucydides\r\nshould be studied closely side by side with this. Murchison’s article,\r\nin his _Treatise on Continued Fever_, though admirable, is so diffuse\r\nas to make comparison difficult.\r\n\r\n[201] _Iliad_ ii. 723.\r\n\r\n[202] _Iliad_ viii. 405 and 419.\r\n\r\n[203] _Adonis_, 16-17.\r\n\r\n[204] _Agamemnon_, 645.\r\n\r\n[205] _Antigone_, 652.\r\n\r\n[206] _On Ancient Medicine_, § 16.\r\n\r\n[207] _Coacae Praenotiones_, § 396.\r\n\r\n[208] _Frogs_, 236.\r\n\r\n[209] _Wasps_, 1119.\r\n\r\n[210] _Ecclesiazusae_, 1057.\r\n\r\n[211] _Epidemics_, iii.\r\n\r\n[212] xli. 21.\r\n\r\n[213] _Obs._ p. 870.\r\n\r\n[214] _Tract. de Peste_, ed. 1669, p. 509.\r\n\r\n[215] _De Peste_, Lib.
