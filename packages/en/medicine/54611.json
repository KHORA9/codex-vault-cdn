A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nInterest in mental disorders is no longer confined to the relatively\r\nsmall number of persons whose duties or family ties bring them into\r\ndaily contact with the mentally ill. Disorders that so profoundly\r\naffect human conduct were certain, sooner or later, to attract the\r\nattention of those who are interested in the study of human behavior\r\nin its broadest relations or who have special responsibilities with\r\nreference to the conduct of individuals and require all the information\r\nthat they can secure on factors that modify the reactions of men,\r\nwomen or children in the social environments in which they live and\r\ndie. Uncertain of themselves until they made sure of the sciences\r\nupon which their future work was to develop, social workers since the\r\ncommencement of organized social work in this country demanded of the\r\nsciences concerned with the human mind some information that might aid\r\nthem in dealing with the difficult problems in human adaptation which\r\nthey found constituted the chief part of social work. Judges and those\r\nwho are interested in penology have within recent years turned also\r\nto the students of abnormal human behavior for light upon problems of\r\ncrime and delinquency. With mental hygiene becoming firmly established\r\nas a practical field of preventive medicine, another group of persons\r\nnot directly concerned with the care of the mentally ill has become\r\ndeeply interested in the forms, types and causes of mental illness.\r\nIt is by such readers, quite as much as physicians, medical students\r\nand nurses, that Dr. May's work in bringing together the main facts\r\nregarding mental diseases and the people who suffer from them will be\r\nappreciated. For those whose interest in the subject is incidental\r\nand not part of a life-long study, the information here presented will\r\nbe of special value. There are, it is true, many technical works on\r\nmental diseases in their medical, social and legal relations, but it\r\nis doubtful whether elsewhere there can be found in a single volume as\r\nmuch varied information as that which Dr. May has brought together.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no group of diseases about which there is such\r\nwidespread popular ignorance or misinformation as those that affect\r\nthe mind. People who would be ashamed not to have accurate information\r\nregarding the more important infectious diseases and more than\r\ngeneral knowledge of the means by which they are transmitted speak\r\nof \"insanity\" as if there were a single disorder to which that name\r\ncould properly be applied, and are without the slightest knowledge\r\nof the different forms of mental diseases, the periods of life in\r\nwhich they appear, their main characteristics and the means by which\r\nthey terminate. Statistics relating even to those persons with mental\r\ndisorders who are cared for in special institutions are usually\r\nquite unfamiliar to persons who have more than an ordinary amount of\r\ninformation regarding the prevalence of other diseases. Such a book as\r\nthis will go far toward supplying the extraordinary lack of knowledge\r\nof conditions that have exceedingly important social and economic\r\nrelations and from the study of which many lessons can be drawn that\r\nare applicable to human affairs far removed from those relating to\r\npatients in our hospitals for the insane.\r\n\r\n                                            THOMAS W.

We\r\nhave, as will be shown, practically no information whatever as to the\r\nincidence of mental diseases in the community. Hospital statistics are\r\nstill in such a chaotic state that we are not even in a position to\r\nspeak authoritatively of that part of the population which is entirely\r\nwithin our supervision and control in institutions. Before any progress\r\ncan be hoped for we must at least have at our disposal accurate data\r\nrelative to the patients within the walls of our hospitals. This\r\npresupposes a uniform scheme of statistical reports based upon some\r\ncommon viewpoint. Adequate preparations for this undertaking have been\r\nmade by the American Psychiatric Association and the National Committee\r\nfor Mental Hygiene. Every hospital for mental diseases in the country\r\nhas been urged to cooperate in this movement. To show the necessity for\r\nmore actively prosecuting this research has been one of the principal\r\npurposes of this book.\r\n\r\nIn elaborating somewhat briefly the conception of the various psychoses\r\ngenerally accepted by American psychiatrists, and for that reason\r\nincluded in the classification adopted by the Association, every effort\r\nhas been made, as far as possible, to show the steps which have led up\r\nto present developments. The author has endeavored to confine himself\r\nto reflecting the views of others throughout and has used actual\r\nquotations from recognized authorities as far as was deemed advisable.\r\nIn the discussion of the various psychoses frequent references will be\r\nnoted to the description of the various clinical groups contained in\r\nthe manual prepared by the Committee on Statistics for the American\r\nPsychiatric Association. As is shown in the manual, these definitions\r\nand explanatory notes were formulated by Dr. George H. Kirby.\r\n\r\nSpecial reference should be made to the important contributions to\r\nthe literature of psychiatry of such well-known American writers as\r\nMeyer, Hoch, Kirby, White, Barrett, Campbell, Southard, Peterson,\r\nDiefendorf, Jelliffe, Paton, Salmon, Russell, Buckley, Rosanoff,\r\nOrton, Singer and many others. The work of Kraepelin, Bleuler, Nissl,\r\nAlzheimer, Freud, Jung, Stekel, Janet and others abroad has exercised\r\nan influence on the psychiatry of the day which must be recognized. We\r\nare very largely indebted to Pollock and to Furbush for the available\r\ninformation relating to the incidence of the various psychoses in this\r\ncountry. To the American Psychiatric, for many years the American\r\nMedico-Psychological, Association we owe an exhaustive historical\r\nreview of the institutional care and treatment of mental diseases in\r\nthe United States and Canada.\r\n\r\nObviously this work was not intended as a textbook, nor was it designed\r\nto serve the purpose of one. It is an appeal to those who are already\r\nfamiliar with the fundamental principles of psychiatry. For that\r\nreason the interpretation of mental mechanisms given so much space in\r\ntextbooks has been entirely omitted and no reference is made to the\r\ntreatment of the individual psychoses. Such reliable statistical data\r\nas could be gathered from recent hospital reports and publications\r\nhave been utilized in full. The following institutions were represented\r\nin this study:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. MASSACHUSETTS—fourteen hospitals (1919-1920): Boston State\r\n Hospital, Boston; Bridgewater State Hospital, State Farm; Danvers\r\n State Hospital, Hathorne; Foxborough State Hospital, Foxborough;\r\n Gardner State Colony, Gardner; Grafton State Hospital, North Grafton;\r\n McLean Hospital, Waverley; Medfield State Hospital, Harding; Monson\r\n State Hospital, Palmer; Northampton State Hospital, Northampton; State\r\n Infirmary, Tewksbury (Mental Wards); Taunton State Hospital, Taunton;\r\n Westborough State Hospital, Westborough; Worcester State Hospital,\r\n Worcester.\r\n\r\n 2. NEW YORK—thirteen hospitals (1912-1919): Binghamton State\r\n Hospital, Binghamton; Brooklyn State Hospital, Brooklyn; Buffalo\r\n State Hospital, Buffalo; Central Islip State Hospital, Central Islip;\r\n Gowanda State Homeopathic Hospital, Collins; Hudson River State\r\n Hospital, Poughkeepsie; Kings Park State Hospital, Kings Park, L. I.;\r\n Manhattan State Hospital, Ward's Island, New York City; Middletown\r\n State Homeopathic Hospital, Middletown; Rochester State Hospital,\r\n Rochester; St. Lawrence State Hospital, Ogdensburg; Utica State\r\n Hospital, Utica; Willard State Hospital, Ovid.\r\n\r\n 3. Twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other states:\r\n\r\n ARKANSAS—State Hospital for Nervous Diseases, Little Rock (1917-1918).\r\n\r\n COLORADO—Colorado State Hospital, Pueblo (1917 and 1918).\r\n\r\n CONNECTICUT—Connecticut State Hospital, Middletown (1917 and 1918);\r\n Norwich State Hospital, Norwich (1905-1918 inclusive).\r\n\r\n MARYLAND—Springfield State Hospital, Sykesville, 1919; Spring Grove\r\n State Hospital, Catonsville, 1918 and 1919.\r\n\r\n MICHIGAN—Pontiac State Hospital, Pontiac, 1917 and 1918; State\r\n Psychopathic Hospital, Ann Arbor, 1917 and 1918; Traverse City State\r\n Hospital, Traverse City, 1917 and 1918.\r\n\r\n MONTANA—Montana State Hospital, Warm Springs, 1917 and 1918.\r\n\r\n NEW JERSEY—Essex County Hospital, Overbrook, 1918.\r\n\r\n PENNSYLVANIA—State Hospital Southeastern District of\r\n Pennsylvania, Norristown, 1919.\r\n\r\n SOUTH CAROLINA—South Carolina State Hospital, Columbia, 1918.\r\n\r\n UTAH—State Mental Hospital, Provo, 1918.\r\n\r\n VERMONT—Vermont State Hospital, Waterbury, 1917 and 1918.\r\n\r\n VIRGINIA—Central State Hospital, Petersburg, 1919; Western State\r\n Hospital, Staunton, 1919.\r\n\r\n WASHINGTON—Eastern State Hospital, Medical Lake, 1917 and 1918;\r\n Northern State Hospital, Sedro Woolley, 1917 and 1918.\r\n\r\n WEST VIRGINIA—Spencer State Hospital, 1917 and 1918; Weston State\r\n Hospital, Weston, 1917 and 1918.\r\n\r\nThese institutions may, I think, be looked upon as fairly\r\nrepresentative of the hospitals of this country. Based on their\r\nofficial reports an analysis has been made of over seventy thousand\r\nconsecutive first admissions.\r\n\r\nThere is no disposition on the part of the writer to overestimate the\r\nvalue of statistical studies. Our conclusions should, however, be\r\nbased as fully as possible on facts rather than on abstract theories\r\nor individual observations alone. The social, economic and clinical\r\naspects of mental diseases must all be given adequate consideration if\r\npsychiatry is to fulfill its obligation to the community and assume a\r\ndignified rôle in the advancement of modern medicine.\r\n\r\n                                                JAMES V. MAY.\r\n\r\n  Boston, Mass.,\r\n  December 15, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART I\r\n\r\n                        GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of mental diseases as a factor in the social and\r\neconomic welfare of the community has not been given adequate\r\nconsideration, notwithstanding the remarkable progress of modern\r\npsychiatry. Nor is this influence, unfortunately, one which can be\r\neasily estimated or accurately determined. We have, as a matter of\r\nfact, no data at hand to show the prevalence of disease, either\r\nphysical or mental, with any degree of exactness even under our most\r\nelaborately organized forms of government. There is no complete\r\ninformation available which will enable us to determine the frequency\r\nof such important conditions as appendicitis, cardiac or renal\r\ndiseases, peritonitis, septic infections, diseases of the eye, ear,\r\nskin or nervous system. It is true that there are, in the majority of\r\nstates, records of contagious or readily communicable diseases which\r\nare probably fairly reliable. Aside from this, the only information at\r\nour disposal is confined to mortality statistics.\r\n\r\nThis suggests a further consideration of the advisability, if not\r\nabsolute necessity, of more extensive statistical studies of diseases,\r\nboth mental and physical, if the welfare of the community is to be\r\nsafeguarded and the future of medical science assured. Every physician\r\nshould be required by law to make careful reports to the Board of\r\nHealth of his state showing all medical conditions requiring treatment\r\nby him or coming to his professional notice. The value of such\r\ninformation to medical science would much more than compensate for the\r\ncomparatively small cost of such an undertaking. Nor is this procedure\r\nmore radical either in theory or practice than was the proposal to\r\nreport all communicable diseases only a few years since. The data thus\r\nmade available in the various states should be correlated and published\r\nby the Public Health Service.\r\n\r\nThe mortality statistics of the United States Census Bureau furnish\r\nus with a valuable index of the relative frequency of the various\r\ndisease processes which determine the death rate of the community.\r\nThey are based on the transcripts of death certificates received\r\nfrom the so-called registration area, which in 1920 had an estimated\r\npopulation of 87,486,713. The total number of deaths reported in 1920\r\nwas 1,142,558, a rate of 13.1 per 1,000 of the population. It is true\r\nthat the epidemic of influenza was still a factor of some importance at\r\nthat time. The rate for 1916, however, was fourteen, for 1917 fourteen\r\nand two-tenths, for 1918 eighteen and one-tenth and for 1919 twelve\r\nand nine-tenths per 1,000 of the population. The registration area\r\nnow includes thirty-four states:—California, Colorado, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,\r\nMaine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,\r\nMissouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North\r\nCarolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina,\r\nTennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. It\r\nis interesting, at least, to note the states not included in the\r\nregistration area:—Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa,\r\nNevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, West\r\nVirginia and Wyoming. The results obtained from a study of the reports\r\nfrom such an extensive district must be looked upon as thoroughly\r\nrepresentative of the country at large. The last complete statistics\r\navailable are those for 1920. Influenza was still an important factor\r\nat that time, it being responsible for a death rate of 71 per 100,000.\r\nThe influenza rate was 98.8 in 1919, 302.1 in 1918, 17.3 in 1917, 26.5\r\nin 1916, 16 in 1915, 9.1 in 1914 and 10.3 in 1912.\r\n\r\nThe important causes of death in 1920 were as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                  _Rate per   _Percentage_\r\n                                                  100,000_\r\n  Typhoid fever                                      7.8            .6\r\n  Malaria                                            3.6            .3\r\n  Measles                                            8.8            .7\r\n  Whooping cough                                    12.5           1.0\r\n  Diphtheria and croup                              15.3           1.2\r\n  Influenza                                         71.0           5.4\r\n  Tuberculosis of the lungs                        100.8           7.7\r\n  Other forms of tuberculosis                        7.8            .6\r\n  Cancer and other malignant tumors                 83.4           6.4\r\n  Simple meningitis                                  6.0            .5\r\n  Cerebral hemorrhage                               80.9           6.2\r\n  Organic diseases of the heart                    141.9          10.9\r\n  Pneumonia (all forms)                            137.3          10.5\r\n  Other diseases of the respiratory system\r\n    (tuberculosis and pneumonia excepted)           11.6            .9\r\n  Appendicitis and typhlitis                        13.4           1.0\r\n  Hernia, intestinal obstruction                    10.6            .8\r\n  Cirrhosis of the liver                             7.1            .5\r\n  Acute nephritis and Bright's disease              89.4           6.8\r\n  Puerperal septicaemia                              6.6            .5\r\n  Other puerperal accidents of pregnancy and labor  12.5           1.0\r\n  Congenital debility and malformation              69.8           5.3\r\n  Violent deaths (suicide excepted)                 78.5           6.0\r\n  Suicide                                           10.2            .8\r\n  Unknown or ill-defined diseases                   17.7           1.4\r\n\r\nThe pneumonia rate (all forms) for 1920 was quite unusual, 137.3 per\r\n100,000, as compared with 123.5 in 1919, 286.6 in 1918, 150.5 in 1917,\r\n137.8 in 1916, 133.1 in 1915, 127.3 in 1914, 132.6 in 1913, 132.4 in\r\n1912, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the average rate per 100,000 of some of the\r\nmore important general diseases during a period of eight years (1912,\r\n1913, 1914, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919):\r\n\r\n  Typhoid fever                                            13.86\r\n  Measles                                                   9.01\r\n  Scarlet fever                                             4.87\r\n  Whooping cough                                           10.11\r\n  Diphtheria and croup                                     16.30\r\n  Tuberculosis (all forms)                                144.52\r\n  Cancer and other malignant tumors                        80.27\r\n  Cerebral hemorrhage, apoplexy                            78.91\r\n  Acute endocarditis and organic diseases of the heart    153.65\r\n  Pneumonia (all forms)                                   152.98\r\n  Acute nephritis and Bright's disease                    101.63\r\n\r\nThe death rate from diseases of the nervous system is of particular\r\ninterest. The average annual rate per 100,000 of the population for the\r\nyears 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1919 was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Encephalitis                                   1.0\r\n  Meningitis (total)                             8.17\r\n  Locomotor ataxia                               2.27\r\n  Other diseases of the spinal cord (total   )   8.57\r\n  Cerebral hemorrhage, apoplexy                 80.57\r\n  Softening of the brain                         1.25\r\n  Paralysis without specified cause              7.65\r\n  General paralysis of the insane                6.77\r\n  Other forms of mental alienation               2.17\r\n  Epilepsy                                       4.07\r\n  Chorea                                          .10\r\n  Other diseases of the nervous system           3.85\r\n\r\nThis shows a total death rate for nervous and mental diseases of 126.44\r\nper 100,000. It is a fairly reasonable assumption that of the above,\r\nthe following, at least, may be classified as having been definitely\r\nassociated with psychoses:\r\n\r\n                                 _Rate per 100,000_\r\n  Encephalitis                           1.0\r\n  Meningitis                             8.17\r\n  Softening of the brain                 1.25\r\n  General paralysis of the insane        6.77\r\n  Other forms of mental alienation       2.17\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, reasonably conclude that there was an average number\r\nof at least 19.36 per 100,000 (from 1906 to 1910 this amounted to\r\n32.1) in which the primary cause of death was associated with mental\r\ndiseases, an exceedingly conservative estimate. This does not take into\r\nconsideration the deaths due to senility (15.5) or suicide (12.8),\r\nconditions which might very logically be included for obvious reasons.\r\nIt is, of course, well known that the psychoses rarely, if ever, appear\r\nin the death certificates as a primary cause of death. As a matter of\r\nfact, they are not always shown in the secondary causes. Information\r\non this subject is still less satisfactory from a statistical point of\r\nview. During the year 1917 (contributory causes have not been reported\r\nsince that year) there was a total of 1,066,711 primary causes of death\r\nshown in the registration area and only 372,291 contributory causes. Of\r\nthis number the following may be classified as having been associated\r\nwith psychoses:\r\n\r\n    _Disease_                       _Primary  _Contributory\r\n                                      Cause_      Cause_\r\n  Encephalitis                         620          904\r\n  Meningitis (total)                 6,673        6,815\r\n  Softening of the brain               888          722\r\n  General paralysis of the insane    5,248          648\r\n  Other forms of mental alienation   1,651        3,895\r\n                                    ——————       ——————\r\n      Total                         15,080       12,987\r\n\r\nThe contributory causes definitely showing mental diseases constitute\r\nonly 3.4 per cent of the whole number, and the death rate for 1917,\r\nincluding both primary and contributory causes suggestive of probable\r\npsychoses, was 37.2 per 100,000. This would indicate that the number\r\nof deaths from mental diseases shown in the primary causes represents\r\nonly about fifty-three per cent of all mental cases which are actual\r\nfactors in determining the death rate of the community. A comparison\r\nof these figures with the number of cases dying in hospitals shows\r\nthat they cannot be looked upon as determining the percentage of the\r\ngeneral population showing psychoses. Of the 1,952 persons dying\r\nin the institutions for mental diseases in Massachusetts in 1919,\r\napproximately nineteen per cent showed the psychoses in the primary\r\ncauses of death. This percentage would probably be fairly constant\r\nthroughout the country. It is, of course, a well recognized fact that\r\nthe death certificate at best is not beyond suspicion and does not\r\nfurnish information regarding the cause of death which can be accepted\r\nwithout question.\r\n\r\nDr. Richard C. Cabot[1] has made an elaborate study of errors in\r\ndiagnosis as shown by autopsies. His work shows the following\r\npercentage of diagnostic accuracy:\r\n\r\n                                 _Per cent._\r\n  Diabetes mellitus                  95\r\n  Typhoid fever                      92\r\n  Aortic regurgitation               84\r\n  Lobar pneumonia                    74\r\n  Cerebral tumor                     72.8\r\n  Tubercular meningitis              72\r\n  Gastric cancer                     72\r\n  Mitral stenosis                    69\r\n  Brain hemorrhage                   67\r\n  Aortic stenosis                    61\r\n  Phthisis, active                   59\r\n  Miliary tuberculosis               52\r\n  Chronic interstitial nephritis     50\r\n  Hepatic cirrhosis                  39\r\n  Acute endocarditis                 39\r\n  Bronchopneumonia                   33\r\n  Acute nephritis                    16\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that Cabot's findings are discouraging. They\r\nare not so bad as they would seem, however, at first thought. Death\r\ncertificates, unfortunately, do not have the significance which they\r\nshould have. Physicians are well known to be entirely too careless\r\nin their preparation and inclined to look upon them merely as legal\r\nformalities which cannot readily be avoided. It is furthermore\r\ndifficult, as every doctor knows, to point to one immediate primary\r\ncause of death in every instance. Very often there is a combination\r\nof factors concerned and it is possible at practically every autopsy\r\nto find lesions not represented in any way whatever in the death\r\ncertificate. It is unquestionably true that statistics of any kind\r\nmust be based on information some of which we know to be inaccurate.\r\nThis should not be used as an argument for discontinuing, absolutely,\r\nour search for knowledge. It is merely a reason why our clinical\r\nstandards should be improved.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important contribution to our rather limited fund of\r\naccurate information regarding the general health of the country was\r\nthe publication recently issued by the Metropolitan Life Insurance\r\nCompany[2] on the mortality statistics of wage earners and their\r\nfamilies. This covers a period of six years (1911 to 1916) and\r\nrepresents a study of 635,449 deaths. The cases reported came from\r\nevery state in the union with the following exceptions: Mississippi,\r\nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, Colorado, Texas, Nevada, Arizona\r\nand New Mexico. Canada and many other localities outside of the\r\n\"Registration Area\" of the United States Census Bureau were included.\r\nThe facts presented in this report are unique in that they render\r\navailable for the first time a careful and detailed consideration\r\nof the diseases which may be looked upon as representative of the\r\nindustrial population of the country. The various occupations shown in\r\nthe order of their numerical importance were as follows:—Laborers,\r\nteamsters, drivers and chauffeurs, machinists, textile mill operatives,\r\nclerks, office assistants, etc. It covers a study of ten million policy\r\nholders and nearly fifty-four million years of life in the aggregate.\r\nThe age groups studied range from one year to seventy-five in ratios\r\nnot very different from those exhibited in the general population. The\r\ndeath rate for all persons exposed was 11.81 per 1,000 as compared with\r\na rate of over thirteen per 1,000 (white) of the general population of\r\nthe registration area during the same period of time. The death rate\r\nper 100,000 from 1911 to 1916 of some of the more important general\r\ndiseases was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Typhoid fever                    16.8\r\n  Diphtheria and croup             24.3\r\n  Scarlet fever                     8.6\r\n  Acute articular rheumatism        6.3\r\n  Diabetes                         14.4\r\n  Cancer and other malignant\r\n    tumors                         70.0\r\n  Bronchopneumonia                 30.2\r\n  Diarrhea and enteritis (over\r\n    two years old)                 13.9\r\n  Cirrhosis of the liver           15.0\r\n  Puerperal septicemia              8.1\r\n  Accidents of all forms           75.1\r\n  Ill-defined diseases             10.1\r\n  Measles                           8.9\r\n  Influenza                        15.0\r\n  Tuberculosis (all forms)        205.1\r\n  Tuberculosis (pulmonary)        173.9\r\n  Alcoholism                        4.7\r\n  Diseases of the arteries,\r\n    including atheroma,\r\n    aneurysm, etc.                 17.0\r\n  Pneumonia (lobar and\r\n    undefined)                     77.5\r\n  Intestinal obstruction            5.9\r\n  Bright's disease                 96.8\r\n  Suicide                          12.2\r\n  Homicide                          7.0\r\n\r\nThe death rate for syphilis, locomotor ataxia and general paralysis of\r\nthe insane, combined, was 14.3 per 100,000. The percentage of deaths\r\ndue to diseases of the nervous system, many of which must be looked\r\nupon as probably having been associated with mental disturbances, is\r\nsomewhat surprising, as shown by the following table:\r\n\r\n  Encephalitis                             1.0\r\n  Meningitis                               7.8\r\n  Locomotor ataxia                         1.5\r\n  Acute anterior poliomyelitis             3.5\r\n  Other diseases of the spinal cord        4.0\r\n  Cerebral hemorrhage (apoplexy)          68.1\r\n  Softening of the brain                    .9\r\n  Paralysis without specified cause        5.2\r\n  General paralysis of the insane          4.1\r\n  Other forms of mental alienation         1.4\r\n  Epilepsy                                 3.5\r\n  Convulsions (non-puerperal)               .2\r\n  Chorea                                    .2\r\n  Neuralgia and neuritis                    .6\r\n  Other diseases of the nervous system     2.5\r\n\r\nThis shows a total rate of 104.5 per 100,000 due to diseases of the\r\nnervous system. If to this we add those dying of senility and the\r\nsuicides as probably representing psychoses it would bring the total\r\nup to 123.2 per 100,000. It must be confessed, however, that such\r\nspeculations mean comparatively little.\r\n\r\nPractically the only other source of information at our disposal\r\nrelative to the incidence of general diseases in the community is the\r\ntabulation of communicable diseases by Boards of Heath. The annual\r\nreport of the United States Public Health Service for 1919 shows a\r\ncase rate for diphtheria of 137 per 100,000 of the population based\r\non the reports of thirty-seven states. The case rate for measles in\r\nthirty-seven states was 170. Poliomyelitis in thirty states showed a\r\nrate of 2.5 and scarlet fever a rate of 110 in thirty-seven states. The\r\nsmallpox rate was sixty-eight and represented thirty-six states. The\r\ntyphoid fever rate for thirty-seven states was only forty. The case\r\nrate for tuberculosis, all forms, was 346.7 in 1918. It was 274.2 in\r\nNew York, 271.6 in the District of Columbia and 271.3 in New Jersey.\r\nThese were the highest reported in the United States during that year.\r\nUnfortunately these statistics relate to communicable diseases only.\r\nThis difficulty is due largely to the fact that comparatively few\r\nstates have made attempts to keep elaborate records. The reports of\r\nMassachusetts are probably as comprehensive as any. The case rate per\r\n100,000 of the population of all reportable diseases during the year\r\n1920 was as follows:\r\n\r\n  Influenza                             938.5\r\n  Measles                               830.7\r\n  Pneumonia, lobar                      143.6\r\n  German measles                         12.5\r\n  Pulmonary tuberculosis                173.1\r\n  Tuberculosis, other forms              20.7\r\n  Diphtheria                            194.2\r\n  Gonorrhea                             186.7\r\n  Whooping cough                        258.3\r\n  Scarlet fever                         265.2\r\n  Chicken pox                           138.4\r\n  Mumps                                 154.1\r\n  Syphilis                               77.2\r\n  Ophthalmia                             42.3\r\n  Typhoid fever                          24.2\r\n  Dysentery                               1.0\r\n  Epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis       4.7\r\n  Malaria                                 1.6\r\n  Pellagra                                 .4\r\n  Smallpox                                 .7\r\n  Trachoma                                2.2\r\n\r\nThe case rates for influenza and pneumonia cannot be looked upon as\r\nrepresentative, owing to the epidemic of 1919 and 1920. During 1917\r\nthe death rate from influenza was 12.9 per 100,000 and from pneumonia\r\n163.8. The death rate from heart diseases (organic diseases of the\r\nheart and endocarditis) in Massachusetts in 1920 was 178 per 100,000\r\nof the population, from apoplexy 108.4, cancer and other malignant\r\ndiseases 116.7, Bright's disease and nephritis 92.4, diarrhea and\r\nenteritis 52.9, violence 76.3, automobile accidents and injuries 11.9\r\nand suicides 10.1.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that it is exceedingly difficult to establish a\r\ndefinite basis for a comparison of our statistics relating to mental\r\ndisorders and those dealing with the frequency of other diseases\r\nin the community. As has been shown, our information on the latter\r\nsubject, such as it is, has to do only with communicable diseases\r\nand the reported death rates. In making an analysis of the reports\r\nof mental diseases we are limited almost entirely to the institution\r\npopulation. It is true that these statistics are much more reliable\r\nthan the others, as we are dealing with a stable population entirely\r\nunder control. The cases, furthermore, are almost invariably subject\r\nto a prolonged observation and careful study. The diagnosis in almost\r\nevery instance is based on elaborate mental examinations and exhaustive\r\npersonal and family histories. It is, of course, true that there are\r\ninnumerable cases of mental diseases outside of institutions. There\r\nwere 18,268 patients at home on visit from the state hospitals alone\r\non January 1, 1920. Those not requiring hospital treatment or custody\r\nin an institution can, however, be eliminated for the purpose of\r\ncomparative studies. The fact that an analysis of death rates alone\r\ndoes not throw any light whatever on the frequence of psychoses for\r\nreasons already given will, I think, be conceded. For statistical\r\npurposes, at least, it may be assumed that the frequence of mental\r\ndiseases as shown by a study of the hospital population is fairly\r\nrepresentative of conditions existing in the community.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of comparison we may contrast the admission rate of mental\r\ndiseases per 100,000 of the population in Massachusetts in 1920 with\r\nthe case rate of communicable diseases as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mental diseases               101.7\r\n  Chicken pox                   138.4\r\n  Diphtheria                    194.2\r\n  German measles                 12.5\r\n  Gonorrhea                     186.7\r\n  Measles                       830.7\r\n  Mumps                         154.1\r\n  Scarlet fever                 265.2\r\n  Syphilis                       77.2\r\n  Tuberculosis, pulmonary       173.1\r\n  Tuberculosis, other forms      20.7\r\n  Typhoid fever                  24.2\r\n  Whooping cough                258.3\r\n\r\nThe total institution population (mental cases) at the end of the\r\nyear 1920 represented a rate of 395.49 per 100,000 of the population.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that, with the exception of tuberculosis\r\nand syphilis, the communicable diseases reported above represent,\r\nas a rule, the total number of cases in the state during the year.\r\nComparative studies should, therefore, be based not on the number\r\nof mental cases in the hospitals at any one given time, but on the\r\ntotal number under treatment during the year. This would indicate _an\r\nincidence of mental diseases of 566.98 per 100,000 of the population_.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1916, there were 147 state and federal institutions\r\nfor the care and treatment of mental diseases in the United States,\r\nas shown by the Census Bureau reports. There were at this same time\r\ntwenty-seven institutions for the feebleminded, nine for epileptics,\r\nthree for inebriates, forty-five for tuberculosis, twenty-eight for the\r\nblind, thirty-three for the deaf, twelve for the blind and deaf and\r\neighty-four for the dependent classes.[3]\r\n\r\nThe appropriations for the maintenance of these institutions for 1915\r\namounted to $33,557,058.29. This constituted 7.6 per cent of the\r\nappropriations made by those states for all purposes. In Massachusetts\r\nit represented 14.8 per cent, in New Hampshire 10.1, in New York 12.7,\r\nin Ohio 12, in Indiana 10.7, in Illinois 13.4, and in a number of other\r\nstates over ten per cent of the appropriations for all purposes. It was\r\nequivalent to an average of $431.16 per million of the total assessed\r\nvaluation of these states. In Massachusetts it was as high as $653.62\r\nand in New York $567.37. This means thirty-three cents per capita for\r\nall states, eighty-four cents for Massachusetts and sixty-eight cents\r\nfor New York.\r\n\r\nThe actual expenditure for the maintenance of these institutions was\r\n$36,312,662.20. For purposes of comparison, attention should be called\r\nto the fact that the maintenance of the tuberculosis hospitals of the\r\nUnited States for the same year cost $3,539,454.95, institutions for\r\ncriminals $21,244,892.00, for the feebleminded $3,341,442.85, for\r\nepileptics $1,345,821.57, for the blind $1,066,973.14, for the deaf\r\n$1,893,490.09 and for the dependent classes $9,675,932.37.\r\n\r\nThe value of the property invested in the state and federal hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases in 1916 was estimated at $187,028,728.00. The\r\nvaluation of these institutions per 100,000 of the population\r\nwas $184,795.81. This does not include establishments for mental\r\ndefectives. The average value per patient was $938.43. In Massachusetts\r\nit was $1,097.85 and in New York $1,039.85. In Arkansas it was as high\r\nas $2,264.00. The total acreage of land was 109,503.2, an average of\r\n744.9 acres per hospital. There were 33,124 persons employed, an\r\naverage of 226.9 for each institution. This represented one employee\r\nfor every six patients.\r\n\r\nThe census taken by the National Committee for Mental Hygiene[4]\r\nin 1920 shows 156 state hospitals for mental diseases, two federal\r\ninstitutions, 125 county or city hospitals and twenty-one institutions\r\nof a temporary care type. In the public and private hospitals for\r\nmental diseases on January 1, 1920, there were 232,680 patients under\r\ntreatment. Of these, 200,109 were in public and 9,238 in private\r\nhospitals. This represented an increase of 8,723 in two years. It is\r\ninteresting to note that city and county institutions cared for 21,584\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe first authoritative information relative to the institution care of\r\nmental diseases was obtained from the federal census reports of 1880.\r\nIn that year there were 40,942 patients in the public hospitals. In\r\n1890 there were 74,028; in 1904, 150,151; in 1910, 187,791; in 1917,\r\n232,873 and in 1918, 239,820. The rate per 100,000 of the population\r\nincreased from 81.6 in 1880 to 229.6 in 1918. From 1910 to 1918 the\r\ngeneral population increased 13.6 per cent and the hospital population\r\n27.7 per cent. The rate per 100,000 of the population in institutions\r\nin Massachusetts[5] on January 1, 1920, was 373.8, in New York 374.6,\r\nin Connecticut 317.8, in Iowa 248.1, in Wisconsin 300.6, in California\r\n297.2, in Pennsylvania 215.2, in Ohio 212.1, in Illinois 229.5 and in\r\nMichigan 210.8. The admission rate per 100,000 of the population in\r\n1917 was 151.6 in Massachusetts, 109.2 in Illinois, 124.8 in Montana,\r\n97.3 in New York, 80.9 in Connecticut and 85.7 in California.\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintenance in the state hospitals increased to\r\n$43,926,888.88 in 1917 with an average per capita cost of $207.28.\r\nThe number of cases cared for in some of the more populous states is\r\nof interest. On January 1, 1920, the institution population of New\r\nYork was 38,903, Pennsylvania 18,764, Ohio 12,217, Illinois 14,884,\r\nMassachusetts 14,399 and California 10,184.\r\n\r\nBased on the estimated population of Massachusetts on July 1, 1920\r\n(3,869,098), the 1,475 deaths in institutions for mental diseases\r\nwould represent a death rate of 38.12 per 100,000 of the population.\r\nThe death rate for other diseases for that year was: diphtheria 15.4,\r\nmeasles 9.0, pulmonary tuberculosis 96.7, typhoid fever 2.5, whooping\r\ncough 14.0, scarlet fever 5.5, syphilis 5.8, lobar pneumonia 71.9\r\nand influenza 43.9. The importance to be attached, however, to such\r\ncomparisons is very uncertain at best. From the standpoint of social\r\nand economic importance to the community there is another factor under\r\nconsideration which should not be overlooked. The duration of other\r\ndiseases, as a general rule, is comparatively short. A study of over\r\nten thousand deaths in New York state hospitals for mental diseases\r\nshows the average hospital residence of these cases to have been over\r\nsix years. At the rate of admission to public institutions for 1917\r\n(62,898) and the average per capita cost for that year ($207.28) the\r\ncare of persons admitted annually, during their years of hospital life,\r\nwould mean an expenditure of over seventy-eight millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nIf we figured the earning capacity of the 62,000 persons admitted to\r\ninstitutions for mental diseases in the United States as averaging only\r\none thousand dollars per year, it would represent an economic loss to\r\nthe country of sixty-two millions of dollars annually. Estimated in\r\nthe same way, the total population of the hospitals would represent\r\nthe staggering sum of nearly two hundred and forty million dollars.\r\nThis, of course, does not take into consideration at all the cost of\r\nmaintenance or the property investment represented by hospitals.\r\n\r\nTo avoid any possibility of confusion, no reference has been made\r\nheretofore to statistical studies of mental deficiency or epilepsy.\r\nFrom a public health point of view, however, and as social and\r\neconomic problems, they are questions which cannot be disregarded\r\nin a consideration of mental diseases. As a matter of fact, they\r\nare very closely correlated in many ways. A survey made by the\r\nNational Committee for Mental Hygiene shows that on January 1, 1920,\r\nthere were in this country thirty-two state institutions for mental\r\ndefectives, eleven admitting both feebleminded and epileptics and\r\ntwenty exclusively for the latter class.[6] In addition to this, one\r\ncity institution was reported. Of the private hospitals twenty-seven\r\ncare for the feebleminded only, and six for epileptics, while\r\nnineteen admit either of these classes. The total number of mental\r\ndefectives in institutions on January 1, 1920, was 40,519. At that\r\ntime 34,836 were in state, 2,732 in other public institutions and\r\n2,951 in private hospitals. In the following states they are cared\r\nfor in hospitals for mental diseases, no other provisions having\r\nbeen made for their treatment:—Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,\r\nLouisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and\r\nWest Virgina. The states reporting the largest number are New York\r\n5,762, Pennsylvania 4,281, Massachusetts 3,192, Illinois 3,147, Ohio\r\n2,435, Michigan 1,849, Iowa 1,704, New Jersey 1,762, Wisconsin 1,624,\r\nMinnesota 1,502, Indiana 1,264 and Missouri 1,047. At the same time\r\nthere were 14,937 epileptics under treatment, 13,223 in state, 859 in\r\nother public institutions and 855 in private hospitals. Colorado,\r\nDelaware, Georgia, Nebraska, New Mexico and Washington take care of\r\nthe epileptics in their hospitals for mental diseases. The intimate\r\nrelation between mental diseases and epilepsy is shown by the fact\r\nthat as nearly as can be determined at this time approximately thirty\r\nper cent of all of the epileptics in our state institutions have been\r\ncommitted as insane. This, however, nowhere nearly includes all of the\r\ncases which actually show mental disorders of one kind or another. The\r\nstates showing the largest numbers of epileptics are New York with\r\n1,683, Ohio 1,680 and Massachusetts 1,227. No other states report\r\nover one thousand, although Michigan and Pennsylvania have over eight\r\nhundred and Illinois and Missouri over seven hundred.\r\n\r\nAlthough the incidence of mental as compared with other diseases\r\nprevalent in the community cannot be established with absolute\r\naccuracy, sufficient evidence has been presented to warrant the\r\nstatement that from the standpoint of the public health we are dealing\r\nwith no other problem of equal importance today. The state care of\r\nmental defects, epilepsy, tuberculosis and the deaf, dumb and blind is,\r\nfor various reasons, of much less consequence to the community than\r\nthe hospital treatment of mental diseases. The defective, delinquent,\r\ncriminal and dependent classes combined do not equal in number the\r\npopulation housed in our state hospitals for mental diseases. Nor\r\ndoes the number of cases cared for in the general hospitals of the\r\nstate, county or municipal type compare in any way with the mental\r\ncases coming under state or federal supervision. It can, I think, be\r\nsaid without any fear of contradiction that no other disease or group\r\nof diseases is of equal importance from a social or economic point\r\nof view. Perhaps nothing emphasizes this fact more strongly than the\r\nreport recently issued from the Surgeon General's office relative to\r\nthe second examination of the first million recruits drafted in 1917.\r\nTwelve per cent of these were rejected on account of nervous or mental\r\ndiseases. The number disqualified for service finally reached a total\r\nof over sixty-seven thousand.\r\n\r\nMental integrity is now looked upon as a military necessity and is\r\ninsisted upon as one of the important requirements of the soldier. It\r\nhas been demonstrated conclusively that only men of the most stable\r\nmental equilibrium can withstand the stress and strain of modern\r\nmethods of warfare. Nor are peacetime requirements any less exacting.\r\nIn commercial competition the law of the survival of the fittest is\r\npractically absolute. The feebleminded often inherit wealth, but they\r\nrarely acquire it. Vaccination for the prevention of smallpox is\r\ncompulsory and the isolation of communicable diseases dangerous to the\r\npublic welfare is rigidly enforced. At the same time we allow many\r\nparanoics the freedom of the country and they occasionally assassinate\r\na President. Psychopaths are not infrequently elected to public office\r\nand epileptics are not disqualified from driving high-powered and\r\ndangerous motor vehicles. The engineers of our fastest trains must\r\nnot be color blind, but they occasionally are victims of the most\r\nfatal of all mental diseases,—general paresis. The navigating officer\r\nof a transatlantic liner, responsible for the lives of hundreds of\r\npassengers, must pass an examination for a license, but he may be\r\ndominated by delusions which escape observation because they are\r\nnot looked for. Important trials, where human lives were at stake,\r\nhave been presided over by insane judges. Army officers in command\r\nof troops in time of war have been influenced by imaginary voices.\r\nInsurance companies issue large policies to individuals suffering from\r\nincipient mental diseases which could be detected by even a superficial\r\npsychiatric examination.\r\n\r\nSerious consideration should be given to the advisability of subjecting\r\nto a careful mental examination such persons, at least, as are to be\r\ncharged with an entire responsibility for the lives of others. It is\r\na question as to whether this procedure is not indicated in the case\r\nof other important public trusts where the interest of the community\r\nshould be safeguarded.\r\n\r\nThe correlation of psychiatry and psychology as scientific aids to\r\nindustrial efficiency promises to open up entirely new and important\r\nsociological fields of research which have only recently attracted\r\nattention.[7] This is a subject of far reaching importance. The extent\r\nto which the industrial classes of the country are affected is shown\r\nby the following analysis of the occupations represented by 104,013\r\nadmissions to New York state hospitals: 1. Professional—(clergy,\r\nmilitary and naval officers, physicians, lawyers, architects, artists,\r\nauthors, civil engineers, surveyors, etc.) 1,926 or 1.8 per cent;\r\n2. Commercial—(bankers, merchants, accountants, clerks, salesmen,\r\nshopkeepers, shopmen, stenographers, typewriters, etc.) 7,572 or\r\n7.2 per cent; 3. Agricultural—(farmers, gardeners, etc.) 5,942 or\r\n5.7 per cent; 4. Mechanics—at Outdoor Vocations—(blacksmiths,\r\ncarpenters, enginefitters, sawyers, painters, etc.) 8,564 or 8.2 per\r\ncent; 5. Mechanics at Sedentary Vocations—(bootmakers, bookbinders,\r\ncompositors, tailors, weavers, bakers, etc.) 7,501 or 7.2 per cent;\r\n6. Domestic Service—(waiters, cooks, servants, etc.) 21,037 or 20.2\r\nper cent; 7. Educational and Higher Domestic Duties—(governesses,\r\nteachers, students, housekeepers, nurses, etc.) 21,861 or 21 per cent;\r\n8. Commercial—(shopkeepers, saleswomen, stenographers,\r\ntypewriters, etc.) 1,140 or 1.09 per cent; 9. Employed at Sedentary\r\nOccupations—(tailoresses, seamstresses, bookbinders, factory workers,\r\netc.) 4,310 or 4.1 per cent; 10. Miners, Seamen, etc., 581 or .56 per\r\ncent; 11. Prostitutes, 81 or .08 per cent; 12. Laborers, 12,962 or 12.4\r\nper cent; No occupation, 7,820 or 7.5 per cent; Unascertained, 2,715 or\r\n2.6 per cent.[8] This certainly indicates an enormous economic loss to\r\nthe community.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation between mental diseases, alcoholism, ignorance,\r\npoverty, prostitution, criminality, mental defects, etc., suggests\r\nsocial and economic problems of far reaching importance, each one\r\nmeriting separate and special consideration. These problems, while\r\nperhaps essentially sociological in origin, have at the same time an\r\nimportant educational bearing, invade the realm of psychology and\r\ndepend largely, if not entirely, upon psychiatry for a solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF THE MODERN HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe medical treatment of mental diseases had its inception, in this\r\ncountry, in the wards of the Philadelphia Hospital, established in\r\n1732 and referred to officially for over a century as an almshouse. It\r\nincluded an infirmary for the \"sick and insane,\" although it apparently\r\nhad no distinct and separate hospital department for many years. \"In\r\n1742,\" to use the words of Dr. D. Hayes Agnew, \"it was fulfilling a\r\nvaried routine of beneficent functions in affording shelter, support\r\nand employment for the poor and indigent, a hospital for the sick,\r\nand an asylum for the idiotic, the insane and the orphan. It was\r\ndispensing its acts of mercy and blessing when Pennsylvania was yet\r\na province and her inhabitants the loyal subjects of Great Britain.\"\r\nIn 1772 it housed as many as three hundred and fifty persons. In 1769\r\nthe General Assembly passed an act authorizing the \"Managers of the\r\nContributions for the Relief and Employment of the Poor,\" who had\r\ncharge of the almshouse, to issue bills of credit for the purpose of\r\nrelieving their indebtedness. This paper currency was issued in three\r\ndenominations—one shilling, two shillings and a half crown. The law\r\nprovided that counterfeiters or persons altering the denomination of\r\nthese bills should be \"sentenced to the pillory, have both his or her\r\nears cut off and nailed to the pillory and be publicly whipped on his\r\nor her back with thirty-nine lashes, well laid on, and, moreover,\r\nevery such offender shall forfeit the sum of one hundred pounds, to be\r\nlevied on his or her land, tenements, goods and chattels.\"[9] This\r\ncertainly must have discouraged counterfeiting. It was not until after\r\nthe institution was removed to the Hamilton estate in Blockley (now\r\na part of West Philadelphia) in 1834 that it came to be known as the\r\n\"Philadelphia Hospital and Almshouse,\" although there was no change\r\nmade in its organization or functions. In 1902, after one hundred\r\nand seventy years of continuous existence, it was finally divided\r\nofficially for administrative purposes into The Philadelphia Home or\r\nHospital for the Indigent, The Philadelphia General Hospital and The\r\nPhiladelphia Hospital for the Insane. At that time the hospital was, as\r\nit is today, the largest on the American continent. The institution,\r\nwhich has admitted mental cases uninterruptedly since 1732, had over\r\nseventeen hundred patients in the department for the insane. In 1917\r\nthis number had increased to nearly three thousand.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons set forth by sundry petitioners in 1751 for a\r\n\"small Provincial Hospital\" in Philadelphia, which at that time had\r\nmade provision for the care of indigent cases only, was \"THAT with the\r\nNumbers of People, the Number of Lunaticks or Persons distempered in\r\nMind and deprived of their rational Faculties, hath greatly increased\r\nin this Province. That some of them going at large are a Terror to\r\ntheir Neighbours, who are daily apprehensive of the Violences they may\r\ncommit; And others are continually wasting their Substance, to the\r\ngreat Injury of themselves and Families, ill disposed Persons wickedly\r\ntaking Advantage of their unhappy Condition, and drawing them into\r\nunreasonable Bargains, etc. That few or none of them are so sensible\r\nof their Condition, as to submit voluntarily to the Treatment their\r\nrespective Cases require, and therefore continue in the same deplorable\r\nState during their Lives; whereas it has been found, by the Experience\r\nof many Years, that above two Thirds of the Mad People received into\r\nBethlehem Hospital, and there treated properly, have been perfectly\r\ncured.\"[10] This resulted eventually in the opening of the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital in 1752. This institution is a general hospital supported\r\nby private funds and has always received mental cases. A separate\r\ndepartment for mental diseases was established in West Philadelphia in\r\n1841. Before this was done considerable difficulty was experienced on\r\naccount of the annoyance of the patients by curious-minded citizens\r\nof the neighborhood. This developed into such a nuisance in 1760 that\r\nit was suggested \"That a suitable Pallisade Fence, either of Iron or\r\nWood, the Iron being preferred, shall be erected in Order to prevent\r\nthe Disturbance which is given to the Lunatics confined in the Cells\r\nby the great Number of People who frequently resort and converse with\r\nthem.\"[11] It was also deemed advisable to employ \"Two Constables or\r\nother proper Persons, to attend at such times as are necessary to\r\nprevent this Inconvenience until ye Fence is erected.\" The public\r\nwas notified later \"that such persons who come out of curiosity to\r\nvisit the house should pay a sum of money, a Groat at least, for\r\nadmittance.\"[12] The Pennsylvania Hospital has played a very important\r\npart in the history of the care and treatment of mental diseases in\r\nthis country. In 1919 it had over three hundred patients.\r\n\r\nThe first institution designed and used exclusively for mental diseases\r\nin this country was the Eastern State Hospital at Williamsburg,\r\nVirginia. It was incorporated by the House of Burgesses in 1768 and\r\nopened for patients on October 12, 1773. It is interesting to note\r\nthat the act of incorporation, except in the title, makes no use of\r\nthe word lunatic, refers frequently to the care and treatment of the\r\npatients, authorizes the appointment of physicians and nurses, and\r\nspecifically designates the institution as a hospital and not an\r\nasylum. The original building was one hundred feet long by thirty-two\r\nfeet two inches wide. During the first year thirty-six patients were\r\nadmitted. The first pay patient was received in 1774 at a rate of\r\nfifteen pounds per annum. An allowance of twenty-five pounds per year\r\nwas made by the legislature for the maintenance and support of each\r\nperson admitted. Visiting physicians prescribed for the patients, and\r\nthe \"keepers\" for the first few years were not graduates in medicine.\r\nThe superintendents were, however, physicians after 1841. Known for\r\nmany years as the \"Publick Hospital,\" the legislature made the mistake\r\nof changing this designation to The Eastern Lunatic Asylum in 1841\r\nand it was not until 1894 that it again officially became a hospital.\r\nVirginia opened its second institution, The Western State Hospital for\r\nthe Insane, at Staunton on July 25, 1828. Its third hospital was opened\r\nat Weston on September 9, 1859. Virginia is thus entitled to the credit\r\nof being the first commonwealth to furnish state care for mental cases\r\nand make adequate provision for them.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the evolution of hospital treatment of mental diseases\r\nwas taken by Maryland in incorporating a hospital for \"The Relief of\r\nIndigent Sick Persons and for the Reception and Care of Lunatics\" in\r\n1797. The hospital was formally opened in 1798 under the management of\r\nthe city of Baltimore, which leased the establishment in 1808 to two\r\nphysicians, who conducted it as a private institution until 1834. It\r\nthen reverted to the state and was operated as the Maryland Hospital.\r\nThe institution was removed to Catonsville in 1872 and is now known as\r\nthe Spring Grove State Hospital, the Johns Hopkins Hospital occupying\r\nthe site of the original building in Baltimore. Another interesting\r\nevent in the history of this institution was the founding of what\r\nsubsequently became the Mount Hope Retreat by the Sisters of Charity,\r\nwho withdrew from the Maryland Hospital in 1840.\r\n\r\nThe earliest hospital care of mental diseases in New York was in the\r\nwards of the New York Hospital which was opened in 1791. A separate\r\nbuilding for mental cases was ready for the reception of patients in\r\n1808. The total number of cases treated up to July 1820 was 1,553. The\r\nBloomingdale Asylum replaced this in 1821, on a piece of property which\r\nnow belongs in part to Columbia University. Public patients were cared\r\nfor at the expense of the state until the opening of the New York City\r\nAsylum in 1839. Church services were inaugurated in 1819. The hospital\r\nbuildings furnished accommodations for about three hundred patients. In\r\n1894 the property on Bloomingdale Road was abandoned and the hospital\r\nremoved to White Plains in Westchester County. It is still known as the\r\nBloomingdale Hospital and is supported entirely by public contributions\r\nand the income derived from the care of patients. It has about three\r\nhundred and fifty beds.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the \"Religious Society of Friends,\" which were\r\nindirectly responsible probably for the inception of the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital, ultimately led to the establishment of the Friends' Asylum\r\nfor the Insane at Frankford, Pennsylvania, in 1817. It was under\r\nsectarian control until 1834, when its doors were thrown open to\r\nall, without regard to religious belief. It claims to be the first\r\ninstitution \"erected on this side of the Atlantic in which a chain was\r\nnever used for the confinement of a patient.\"[13] The hospital is still\r\nin a flourishing condition and has accommodations for over two hundred\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts at the beginning of the nineteenth century had no\r\nhospitals of any kind. In 1764, on the death of Thomas Handcock, it was\r\nfound that provision had been made in his will for the establishment of\r\na hospital for mental diseases in Boston. An expenditure of six hundred\r\npounds was authorized for the purpose of \"erecting and furnishing a\r\nconvenient House for the reception and more comfortable keeping of such\r\nunhappy persons as it shall please God, in His Providence, to deprive\r\nof their reason in any part of this Province.\"[14] The Selectmen of\r\nBoston declined this legacy on the grounds that there were not enough\r\nmental cases in the vicinity to warrant the existence of such an\r\nestablishment. This proved to be an error of judgment on their part.\r\nIn 1811 the Massachusetts General Hospital was incorporated and a fund\r\nof over $93,000 was subscribed for building purposes. As it was deemed\r\nmore urgent, the department for mental diseases in Charlestown was\r\nopened first. It was ready for the reception of patients on October 6,\r\n1818, when it admitted a young man supposed to be possessed of a devil.\r\nThis department became the McLean Asylum in 1826 as the result of a\r\nlegacy of $25,000 left to the institution by a Boston merchant of that\r\nname. The corporation finally received in all an amount approximating\r\n$120,000 from the McLean estate. As early as 1822 the first published\r\nreport of the hospital[15] called attention to the fact that the various\r\namusements offered the patients included \"draughts, chess, backgammon,\r\nninepins, swinging, sawing wood, gardening, reading, writing, music,\r\netc.\" A carriage and pair of horses for the use of patients was\r\npurchased in 1828. In 1835 the first pianos and billiard tables were\r\ninstalled and a library of one hundred and twenty volumes placed in\r\nthe wards. Hot water heating was introduced in 1848. It is interesting\r\nto note that in 1827 the visiting committee reported that the rates\r\nfor the maintenance of patients should not be less than three dollars\r\nor more than twelve dollars per week. In 1882 the McLean Hospital\r\nestablished the first training school for nurses connected with any\r\ninstitution for mental diseases in this country. The first class was\r\ngraduated in 1886. In 1895 the hospital was removed to Waverley,\r\nMassachusetts. A chemical laboratory was opened in 1900 and a\r\npsychological laboratory in 1904. Hydrotherapy was first used in 1899,\r\nand a gymnasium was built in 1904. In 1913 the hospital owned three\r\nhundred and seventeen acres of land and had a capacity of two hundred\r\nand twenty beds, with a plant valued at nearly two million dollars.\r\n\r\nThe first provision for the care of mental diseases in Connecticut was\r\na direct result of the activities of the State Medical Society. It was\r\non their petition that the Hartford Retreat was chartered in 1822.\r\nOver two thousand persons subscribed to a fund for the opening of the\r\nhospital. These subscriptions included \"$30 payable in medicine,\" \"One\r\ngross New London bilious pills, price $30\" and two lottery tickets.[16]\r\nAbout fourteen thousand dollars was subscribed in all, the citizens of\r\nHartford contributing four thousand. The hospital building, designed to\r\naccommodate forty patients, was opened on April 1, 1824, and has always\r\nbeen conducted on an unusually high plane. It now averages about one\r\nhundred and seventy-five patients.\r\n\r\nMental cases were first provided with hospital care in Kentucky when\r\nthe Eastern State Hospital was opened in Lexington on May 1, 1824.\r\nGovernor Adams, who suggested the establishment of this institution,\r\nin a message written in 1821 expressed the opinion that it would be of\r\ngreat benefit to the students of Transylvania University, \"which would\r\nin time repay the obligation by useful discoveries in the treatment of\r\nmental maladies.\"\r\n\r\nThe State Hospital at Columbia, South Carolina, was opened in December,\r\n1828. A curious fact in connection with its history is that in 1829 the\r\nmanagement, having received no patients as yet, advertised for them in\r\nthe newspapers of South Carolina and adjoining states.\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the necessity of making further provision for mental diseases\r\nin Massachusetts became the subject of a legislative investigation and\r\na committee was appointed \"to examine and ascertain the practicability\r\nand expediency of erecting or procuring, at the expense of the\r\nCommonwealth, an asylum for the safe keeping of lunatics and persons\r\nfuriously mad.\"[17] The report of this committee, of which Horace\r\nMann was Chairman, is exceedingly interesting. The following is an\r\nillustration:—\"To him whose mind is alienated, a prison is a tomb,\r\nand within its walls he must suffer as one who awakes to life in the\r\nsolitude of the grave. Existence and the capacity for pain alone are\r\nleft him. From every former source of pleasure or contentment he is\r\nviolently sequestered. Every former habit is abruptly broken off.\r\nNo medical skill seconds the efforts of nature for his recovery, or\r\nbreaks the strength of pain when it seizes him with convulsive grasp.\r\nNo friends relieve each other in solacing the weariness of protracted\r\ndisease. No assiduous affection guards the avenues of approaching\r\ndisquietude. He is alike removed from all the occupations of health,\r\nand from all the attentions everywhere but within his homeless abode\r\nbestowed upon sickness. The solitary cell, the noisome atmosphere,\r\nthe unmitigated cold and the untempered heat, are of themselves\r\nsufficient soon to derange every vital function of the body, and this\r\nonly aggravates the derangement of his mind. On every side is raised up\r\nan insurmountable barrier against his recovery. Cut off from all the\r\ncharities of life, endued with quickened sensibilities to pain, and\r\nperpetually stung by annoyances which, though individually small, rise\r\nby constant accumulation to agonies almost beyond the power of mortal\r\nsufferance; if his exiled mind in its devious wanderings ever approach\r\nthe light by which it was once cheered and directed, it sees everything\r\nunwelcoming, everything repulsive and hostile, and is driven away\r\ninto returnless banishment.\"[18] The investigation conducted by this\r\ncommittee led to the establishment of the Worcester Lunatic Hospital,\r\nlater the Worcester State Hospital, opened on January 19, 1833. The\r\noriginal building was designed to care for one hundred and twenty\r\npatients. After many years of agitation on the part of the public,\r\nthe hospital was removed to a site overlooking Lake Quinsigamond in\r\nthe outskirts of Worcester in 1877. It was soon found that it was\r\nimpracticable to dispense with the use of the old building on Summer\r\nStreet and it became the Worcester Insane Asylum, later the Worcester\r\nState Asylum, and finally the Grafton State Hospital. In 1919 it again\r\nbecame a part of the Worcester State Hospital. The original building is\r\nin excellent condition today and promises an indefinite continuation of\r\nan unusual career of usefulness. Many men destined to occupy positions\r\nof importance in the psychiatric world were trained within its walls.\r\n\r\nThe death of a prominent politician in 1806 is said to have led\r\nindirectly to the establishment of the first hospital for mental\r\ndiseases in Vermont.[19] His medical advisers treated him for some\r\nform of mental alienation by submerging him in water until he became\r\nunconscious. It was thought that this \"would divert his mind and, by\r\nbreaking the chain of unhappy associations, thus remove the cause of\r\nhis disease.\" As this plan failed he was given opium as \"the proper\r\nagent for the stupefaction of the life forces.\" In spite of this\r\nvigorous treatment he died. The immediate event which made possible\r\nthe incorporation of the Vermont Asylum for the Insane in 1835 was a\r\nlegacy of ten thousand dollars rendered available for this purpose\r\nby the will of Mrs. Anna Marsh of Hinsdale. The hospital was opened\r\nin Brattleboro in 1836 and became the Brattleboro Retreat after the\r\nestablishment of the State Hospital at Waterbury. The state care of\r\nmental diseases began in Ohio with the establishment of the Columbus\r\nState Hospital, which was opened on November 30, 1838. This was the\r\nfirst of a number of institutions now under the supervision of the Ohio\r\nBoard of Administration.\r\n\r\nThe study of the development of the state hospital system of care\r\nnow takes us back to Massachusetts. Notwithstanding the fact that\r\nthe state already had two institutions for mental cases, McLean and\r\nthe Worcester Lunatic Hospital, further accommodations were urgently\r\nindicated. This was largely on account of the needs of the metropolitan\r\npopulation centering in the city of Boston. To meet this situation the\r\ncity established a hospital of its own in South Boston in 1839,—the\r\nfirst municipal institution for this exclusive purpose in America.\r\nOriginally known as the Boston Lunatic Hospital and afterwards as the\r\nBoston Insane Hospital, it finally became the Boston State Hospital in\r\nDecember, 1908. Charles Dickens on the occasion of his visit to America\r\n was very profoundly impressed by the hospital and made the following\r\nreferences to it in 1842[20]:—\"At South Boston, as it is called, in\r\na situation excellently adapted for the purpose, several charitable\r\ninstitutions are clustered together. One of these is the hospital for\r\nthe insane; admirably conducted on those enlightened principles of\r\nconciliation and kindness which 20 years ago would have been worse\r\nthan heretical, and which have been acted upon with so much success in\r\nour own pauper asylum at Hanwell....\" \"At every meal, moral influence\r\nalone restrains the more violent among them from cutting the throats of\r\nthe rest; but the effect of that influence is reduced to an absolute\r\ncertainty, and is found, even as a measure of restraint, to say nothing\r\nof it as a means of cure, a hundred times more efficacious than all the\r\nstraight waistcoats, fetters and handcuffs that ignorance, prejudice\r\nand cruelty have manufactured since the creation of the world.\" ... \"In\r\nthe labor department every patient is as freely trusted with the tools\r\nof his trade as if he were a sane man. In the garden and on the farm\r\nthey work with spades, rakes and hoes. For amusement they walk, run,\r\nfish, paint, read, and ride out to take the air in carriages provided\r\nfor the purpose. They have among themselves a sewing society to make\r\nclothes for the poor, which holds meetings, passes resolutions, never\r\ncomes to fisticuffs or bowie-knives as sane assemblies have been known\r\nto do elsewhere; and conducts all its proceedings with the greatest\r\ndecorum. The irritability which would otherwise be expended on their\r\nown flesh, clothes and furniture is dissipated in these pursuits. They\r\nare cheerful, tranquil and healthy.\" ... \"It is obvious that one great\r\nfeature of this system is the inculcation and encouragement, even among\r\nsuch unhappy persons, of a decent self-respect.\" The institution was\r\nremoved to the Dorchester district of Boston in 1895, where it now\r\nhouses in the neighborhood of two thousand patients. The Boston State\r\nHospital was the first institution of its kind in the United States to\r\nestablish a separate psychopathic department, which was opened in 1912.\r\n\r\nInfluenced doubtless by the attention given to this subject in other\r\nstates, Maine opened its first state hospital at Augusta in 1840.\r\nThere were between two and three hundred mental cases in the state\r\nat that time. A second hospital was opened at Bangor in 1889. This\r\nhumanitarian movement naturally extended to New Hampshire. Governor\r\nDinsmore in 1832[21] called attention to the condition of the insane,\r\nseventy-six of whom were in confinement. Of this number seven were in\r\ncells or cages, six in chains and irons and four in jail. Of those not\r\nin confinement at the time, some had been handcuffed previously, while\r\nothers had been in cells or chained. After much unavoidable delay the\r\nNew Hampshire State Hospital was opened at Concord on October 29, 1842.\r\nThe next hospital development appeared in Georgia. After an active\r\ncampaign inaugurated by the physicians of the state and continued for\r\nseveral years, the Georgia State Sanitarium was opened in Milledgeville\r\nin December, 1842. It now houses over four thousand patients.\r\n\r\nBy this time it became evident that further procedures on behalf of\r\nthe persons requiring treatment for mental diseases in New York were\r\nimperative. The Bloomingdale Hospital, although taxed to its utmost\r\ncapacity, was not able to meet the needs of the situation. In 1830\r\nthe population of the state had increased to nearly two million.\r\nThe report of a legislative committee showed that there were 2,695\r\ninsane persons in the state in 1830, with hospital accommodations at\r\nBloomingdale and one other private hospital at Hudson for only two\r\nhundred and fifty of these cases. An extensive system of state care\r\nwas inaugurated by the opening of the Utica State Hospital on January\r\n16, 1843. In addition to numerous other industries and occupations, a\r\nprinting office was established in the hospital and the publication\r\nof the \"American Journal of Insanity\" was undertaken in 1844. This\r\nwas the first journal in the world to be devoted exclusively to the\r\nsubject of mental diseases. \"The Opal,\" edited, published and printed\r\nby the patients of the hospital, was started at the same time. In the\r\nearly days, strong rooms, padded cells and mechanical restraint of all\r\nkinds were used extensively. The \"Utica Crib\" has received a great\r\ndeal of attention. This consisted of an ordinary ward bed enclosed in\r\nwooden slats, making it impossible for the patient to escape. These\r\nwere eliminated for all time by Dr. G. Alder Blumer in 1887. Attendants\r\nwere first required to wear uniforms in 1887. During the following\r\nyear female nurses were assigned for the first time to male wards.\r\nAnnual field day exercises for the benefit of the patients have been\r\nheld since 1887. Baseball games, steamboat excursions, Fourth of July\r\ncelebrations and Christmas entertainments have been in vogue since\r\n1888. With the development of a large department on the \"Marcy\" site,\r\nnine miles from the city, the Utica State Hospital promises to add new\r\naccomplishments to an already dignified history.\r\n\r\nThe early care of mental cases in Rhode Island, as shown by a report\r\nto the legislature by Thomas R. Hazard in 1851, was perhaps no worse\r\nthan that of other states, although the conditions he described\r\nso graphically have not been attributed to other New England\r\ncommunities by historians. The following extract from a codicil to\r\nthe will of Nicholas Brown, who died in 1843, is proof of the fact\r\nthat this unfortunate state of affairs had not entirely escaped\r\nnotice[22]:—\"And whereas it has long been deeply impressed on my mind\r\nthat an insane or lunatic hospital or retreat for the insane should\r\nbe established upon a firm and permanent basis, under an act of the\r\nLegislature, where that unhappy portion of our fellow beings who are,\r\nby the visitation of Providence, deprived of their reason, may find\r\na safe retreat and be provided with whatever may be most conducive\r\nto their comfort and to their restoration to a sound state of mind:\r\nTherefore, for the purpose of aiding an object so desirable and in the\r\nhope that such an establishment may soon be commenced, I do hereby set\r\napart and give and bequeath the sum of $30,000 towards the erection\r\nor endowment of an insane or lunatic hospital or retreat for the\r\ninsane, or by whatever other name it may be called, to be located in\r\nProvidence or its vicinity.\" Supplemental contributions by Cyrus Butler\r\nmade it possible for the incorporators to found the Butler Hospital in\r\nProvidence. The first patients were received on December 1, 1847.\r\n\r\nMore than any other one person, Miss Dorothea L. Dix of Massachusetts\r\nwas undoubtedly directly responsible for the inauguration of the state\r\ncare of mental diseases in this country. She is credited with having\r\nmemorialized twenty-two different state legislatures on this subject.\r\nOne of her first accomplishments consisted in inducing the New Jersey\r\nlegislature to make an appropriation for the establishment of the state\r\nhospital at Trenton. This institution was opened in 1848, after some of\r\nthe hardest campaigning that Miss Dix conducted. The last years of her\r\nlife were spent as an honored guest of the hospital and she died there\r\nin 1887 at the advanced age of eighty-five.\r\n\r\nIndiana inaugurated a system of state care by the establishment of the\r\nCentral Hospital for the Insane in 1848. The East Louisiana Hospital\r\nat Jackson was opened in the same year. Missouri made its first\r\nprovision for mental cases by opening a hospital at Fulton in 1852.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the first hospitals for mental diseases\r\nin this country were located in Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania did not make any provision for a state institution until\r\nthe State Hospital at Harrisburg was opened in 1851. This was only\r\nundertaken after a vigorous campaign on the part of Dorothea Dix had\r\nmade some legislative action almost imperative. This is probably the\r\nonly hospital in the country which has found it necessary to demolish\r\nall of the original buildings and replace them by others. In 1847 Miss\r\nDix visited Tennessee and started a movement which resulted in the\r\nopening of The Central Hospital for the Insane at Nashville, the first\r\ninstitution of the kind in the state. California entered the state\r\nhospital field in 1853 with the establishment of an institution at\r\nStockton. The St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., the first\r\nfederal institution for mental diseases, was opened for patients in\r\n1855. It receives cases from the United States Government Services and\r\nfrom the District of Columbia. Dorothea Dix was largely instrumental\r\nin its origin. The St. Elizabeths Hospital was an early invader of the\r\nfield of scientific research. A pathologist was appointed in 1883. It\r\nwas one of the first institutions to use hydrotherapy extensively. It\r\nnow cares for nearly four thousand patients. Mississippi established\r\nits first state hospital for mental diseases in 1856, North Carolina\r\nin 1856, West Virginia in 1859, Michigan in 1859, Wisconsin in 1860,\r\nTexas in 1861, Kansas in 1866, Minnesota in 1866, Connecticut in 1868,\r\nRhode Island in 1870 and Vermont in 1891. The Sheppard and Enoch Pratt\r\nHospital, a well known private institution in Baltimore, was also\r\nopened in 1891.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly worth while at this time to emphasize the fact that the\r\nnecessity of providing adequate facilities for the care and treatment\r\nof mental diseases, a problem which received little consideration\r\nof any kind for many years, gradually led to the elaboration of an\r\nextensive system of state hospitals. These are to be found now in every\r\npart of the country. They have long since passed through the purely\r\ncustodial stage and have developed into highly specialized modern\r\nhospitals of most advanced type. Their function is to provide proper\r\ntreatment for persons who cannot for financial or other reasons be\r\ncared for in the private hospitals which are to be found in almost all\r\nlocalities. These institutions, originating in Virginia in 1773, now\r\nrepresent one of the most important activities conducted by any state\r\ngovernment. The extent of the field which they cover is illustrated by\r\nthe fact that Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma,\r\nTennessee, Texas, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin each maintain\r\nthree state hospitals for mental diseases; Iowa, Maryland, Missouri\r\nand Virginia each have four institutions of this type, Minnesota five,\r\nCalifornia, Indiana and Michigan six, Pennsylvania seven, Ohio and\r\nIllinois nine, Massachusetts twelve and New York fifteen. In addition\r\nto this eight other states have two hospitals each and seventeen find\r\none such institution sufficient for their needs. It is worthy of note\r\nthat every state without any exception has now recognized the necessity\r\nof making provision for the care and treatment of mental diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION AND METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe administration of the earlier hospitals for mental diseases\r\nwas placed very wisely in the hands of local boards of directors,\r\nmanagers or trustees. These were made up of persons prominent in the\r\ncommunity in which they lived, well known as having a keen interest\r\nin humanitarian movements, and fully deserving of the confidence\r\nreposed in them by the public. They received no compensation other\r\nthan the satisfaction of having served in a worthy cause. The state\r\nhospital at Williamsburg, Virginia, the first of its kind in America,\r\nwas controlled by a court of directors which was made up of some of\r\nthe most prominent Virginians of colonial days. It included Thomas\r\nNelson, Jr., a signer of the Declaration of Independence who served\r\nwith distinction in the Revolutionary War, Peyton Randolph, the\r\nPresident of the first Continental Congress, and George Wythe, the\r\npreceptor in law of both Marshall and Jefferson, as well as a signer\r\nof the Declaration of Independence and professor of law at William\r\nand Mary College, together with various other distinguished citizens,\r\nsome perhaps of less prominence, but all men of the highest standing\r\nin Virginia. The first \"court\" consisted of fifteen members. The\r\nsecond state institution, the Maryland Hospital, under the management\r\nof the city of Baltimore for some years, was eventually placed under\r\nthe control of a board of visitors in 1828. Kentucky's first hospital\r\nwas from the beginning in the charge of a board of ten commissioners.\r\nWhen the second Virginia institution was opened at Staunton, the\r\nform of organization adopted at Williamsburg was duplicated and a\r\ncourt of directors appointed. There were, however, thirteen instead of\r\nfifteen members. The state hospital at Columbia, South Carolina, was\r\noriginally, and still is, under a board of regents. The Massachusetts\r\nhospitals, dating from the opening of Worcester in 1833, have always\r\nhad trustees. The Vermont Asylum, later the Brattleboro Retreat, was\r\nalso managed by a board of trustees, as was the New Hampshire State\r\nHospital at Concord. The Georgia State Sanitarium, opened in the same\r\nyear, adopted a similar form of control. The Utica State Hospital has\r\nbeen conducted from the first by a board of managers, a term which is\r\ngenerally used by the New York institutions. When the Trenton State\r\nHospital was founded it was placed under a board of ten managers,\r\nmore or less along the lines followed at Utica. The State Hospital at\r\nRaleigh, North Carolina, had a board of directors. For many years the\r\nearlier institutions for mental diseases were under no other form of\r\ncontrol, the powers of the trustees being absolute. This is still the\r\ncase in a few states. Usually, however, there is some additional form\r\nof supervision.\r\n\r\nBoards of trustees, managers, directors, or some other local\r\ngoverning body, exist in the following states but without exclusive\r\ncontrol:—Alabama, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho,\r\nIndiana, Louisiana (administrators), Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,\r\nMississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nSouth Carolina (regents), Texas and Virginia.[23]\r\n\r\nIn the following states the hospitals have no local boards of any\r\nkind:—Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode\r\nIsland, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, West\r\nVirginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.[24]\r\n\r\nAs the state hospitals increased in number and importance, steps\r\nwere taken to coordinate their activities and for various obvious\r\nreasons they were soon grouped together in departments. In the states\r\nhaving a sufficient number of hospitals to warrant such a procedure,\r\nseparate specialized administrative units were established under\r\nlunacy commissions, etc. In less populous communities where there were\r\nonly a few hospitals there soon developed a tendency to associate\r\nthem with the charitable, correctional and, in some instances, penal\r\ninstitutions. Seventeen states, as has been shown, now have only\r\none hospital for mental diseases, eight have two and ten only three\r\ninstitutions. This led either to placing the hospitals under boards of\r\ncharities and corrections or to the organization of new departments\r\nknown as boards of control. The hospitals for mental diseases are under\r\nthe supervision of boards of charities and corrections in the following\r\nstates:—Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska,\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota and Virginia.[24]\r\n\r\nBoards of control exist in Arkansas, California, Iowa, Kentucky,\r\nMinnesota, North Dakota, Oregon, Vermont, West Virginia and\r\nWisconsin. California has, in addition to this, a board of charities\r\nand corrections and a commission in lunacy. Vermont has a director\r\nof state institutions. In New Hampshire the board of trustees of\r\nthe state hospital constitutes a commission in lunacy. A number of\r\nstates have special departments for the supervision of hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases and in some instances for the control of\r\nall institutions. Delaware has a board of supervisors of state\r\ninstitutions. This is essentially a board of control. This is true\r\nof the board of commissioners of state institutions in Florida.\r\nIllinois has a department of public welfare, which places the control\r\nof the charitable, penal and corrective institutions, as well as the\r\nhospitals for mental diseases, largely in the hands of one man, a\r\nlayman. Michigan and Pennsylvania also have departments of public\r\nwelfare. Kansas has placed its hospitals under the control of a board\r\nof administration of state charitable institutions. Maryland has a\r\nlunacy commission and Missouri a board of managers. Montana and Nevada\r\neach have a board of commissioners for the insane. New Jersey has a\r\nstate board of control of institutions and agencies, the direction of\r\nthe state hospitals being delegated to a commissioner of charities and\r\ncorrections. New York has the largest department in the country having\r\nexclusive state hospital functions. It is under the supervision of a\r\nhospital commission. Ohio has a board of administration which manages\r\nand governs all of the charitable, corrective and penal institutions\r\nof the state. This is, of course, a board of control pure and simple.\r\nOklahoma has a commissioner of charities and corrections who is an\r\nelective officer, and has, in addition, a lunacy commission and a board\r\nof public affairs. Rhode Island has a penal and charitable commission\r\nof nine members. Utah has a board of insanity and Wyoming a board of\r\ncharities and reform. Massachusetts has a department of mental\r\ndiseases under the direction of a medical commissioner, with four\r\nunpaid associates. In addition to the hospitals for mental diseases\r\nthe department has under its jurisdiction the institutions for the\r\nfeebleminded and the epileptics.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some form of central supervision or control, of\r\nstate institutions in general and hospitals for mental diseases in\r\nparticular, has long been a subject of serious consideration and\r\ndiscussion. The administration of hospitals, prisons, reformatories,\r\netc., by a central board of control may be indicated in states\r\nwhere there are only a few institutions and the creation of highly\r\nspecialized and expensive departments obviously would not be warranted.\r\nThe question may very properly be raised as to the necessity of any\r\nsupervision other than that by local boards of trustees in such\r\ncommunities. A study of methods of supervision made some years ago by\r\nthe medical director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene[25]\r\nshows that the board of control system leaves much to be desired.\r\nHe has expressed himself on this subject in no uncertain terms,\r\nas is shown by the following:—\"Under Boards of Control, politics\r\ninfluence the care of the sick to a degree unknown under different\r\ntypes of supervision and the scientific and humane aspects of the\r\nwork undertaken are generally subordinated to doubtful administrative\r\nadvantages. With hardly an exception, these Boards of Control have not\r\nendeavored to secure better commitment laws, to lead public sentiment\r\nso that higher standards of treatment will be demanded or to deal with\r\nthe great problems of mental disease in any except their narrowest\r\ninstitutional aspects. There has been striking absence of evidences\r\nof any feeling of personal responsibility in these matters; indeed\r\nmany members of these boards would doubtless unhesitatingly state that\r\ntheir duties do not involve such considerations. What the results\r\nwould have been if efficient and fearless local boards of managers had\r\nbeen retained when these states created Boards of Control cannot be\r\nstated. It is an essential part of the policy which places the care\r\nof the insane under this form of administration that there shall be\r\nno \"division of responsibility\" and, seemingly, there is no place\r\nin such a scheme for bodies which are as much interested in the\r\npersonal welfare of the wards of the State as they are in governmental\r\n\"efficiency\" and, which, moreover, are directly accountable to their\r\nneighbors—the friends and relatives of patients. It is interesting to\r\ncompare some of the conditions mentioned with those existing in States\r\nin which the care of the insane is entrusted to Boards created for that\r\nspecial purpose. In these States,—California, Maryland, Massachusetts\r\nand New York,—it can be said truly that the care of the insane reaches\r\nits highest level.\"\r\n\r\nThe experience of the past has shown that the injection of politics\r\ninto the administration of state institutions is almost invariably\r\ndue to the over-centralization of power in state departments, the\r\nlocal boards of trustees or managers either being abolished or largely\r\ndeprived of their authority. The greatest menace to the future welfare\r\nof the hospitals for mental diseases is, in the opinion of many, the\r\nunfortunate result of a popular and more or less legitimate demand for\r\nthe reorganization of state governments, reducing their administrative\r\nactivities to a few separate departments, each one under the entire\r\ncharge of a director responsible only to the Governor. The argument\r\nfor this procedure is that it does away with innumerable commissions,\r\nboards and departments working along independent lines without any\r\nreference to the desirability of coordinating the activities of the\r\nstate as a whole and places the affairs of the commonwealth on an\r\nefficient, systematic and economical basis. There is no question as to\r\nthe theoretical advisability of such methods. The difficulty is, that\r\nin putting into practical operation this unquestionably commendable\r\nundertaking, the humanitarian aspect of the charitable enterprises\r\nconducted by state governments for more than a century, is likely to\r\nbe lost sight of. It is almost invariably urged that the directors\r\nof these various departments should be experienced business men of\r\nrecognized ability and that in only such a way can the affairs of the\r\nstate be put on a \"businesslike basis.\" It must be confessed that\r\nthis argument is one which appeals very strongly to the taxpayer,\r\nwho naturally has not given the matter very careful thought. There\r\nare other important considerations, however, where the question of\r\nadministering hospitals is involved. As Commissioner Kline[26] has\r\nsaid:—\"If it be conceded that the care and treatment of the mentally\r\nsick is a highly specialized medical problem, requiring the services\r\nof medical experts, and that the institutions function primarily\r\nfor the welfare of the patient, then the supervision and control of\r\ninstitutions should be in the hands of medical men especially trained\r\nfor the purpose.\"\r\n\r\nIn some instances where the state governments have been reorganized and\r\nthe proposed consolidation of departments effected, the administration\r\nof the state hospitals has come under the direction of a single\r\nindividual without hospital or institution experience of any kind and\r\nwithout any special knowledge of medicine or psychiatry. There is no\r\nescaping the fact that the administration of a hospital is a medical\r\nproblem. Nor is there any question as to the advisability of some\r\ncentral supervision and financial control of institutions. The hospital\r\ndepartments in our more populous states are, however, so extensive and\r\nso important that they cannot be merged with other interests without\r\nsacrificing to a considerable extent the welfare of the patients. It\r\nshould be remembered, moreover, that the administration of hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases is a specialty and a large one, not specifically\r\nrelated to the problems arising in the management of charitable\r\ninstitutions or prisons. The best results have been obtained where\r\nthere is a division of responsibility between local boards of trustees\r\nor managers and a central body charged with the supervision, and a\r\nlimited or complete financial control, of institutions for mental\r\ndiseases only. The head of such a department should unquestionably be a\r\nmedical man with psychiatric hospital experience. This policy has been\r\nresponsible for the high standards maintained in the state hospitals of\r\nMassachusetts and New York.\r\n\r\nIt is, unfortunately, true that the care of mental diseases is not\r\nexclusively a function of the state or private hospitals. In thirteen\r\nstates, county or municipal institutions are maintained and in\r\ntwenty-five, persons suffering from mental diseases may legally be\r\ncared for in almshouses or poorhouses.\r\n\r\nThere is little uniformity in the laws of the various states relative\r\nto the hospital care of mental diseases, aside from the fact that\r\nalmost without any exception they are designed to provide solely for\r\nthe legal custody of the so-called \"insane\" and the protection of the\r\npublic. \"Insanity,\" as a matter of fact, is a purely legal and not a\r\nmedical term, and may be said to relate to mental diseases only in so\r\nfar as they come within the jurisdiction of the courts.\r\n\r\nStatutory enactments relative to the forms of mental disease which\r\nrender the individual subject to legal custody and detention in an\r\ninstitution are illustrated by the provisions of the Civil Code of\r\nIllinois. This defines an \"insane\" person as one \"who by reason of\r\nunsoundness of mind is incapable of managing his own estate, or is\r\ndangerous to himself or others, if permitted to go at large, or in such\r\ncondition of mind or body as to be a fit subject for care and treatment\r\nin a hospital or asylum for the insane.\" In Alabama a person is legally\r\ninsane \"if he has been found by a proper court deficient or defective\r\nmentally so that for his own or others' welfare his removal is required\r\nfor restraint, care, and treatment.\" As a general rule, provision by\r\nlaw is made 1, for an application for commitment; 2, for a medical\r\ncertificate of two or more properly qualified physicians showing the\r\nperson to be insane and a proper subject for care and treatment in an\r\ninstitution, and 3, for the order of the Judge of a Court of Record for\r\ncommitment to a state hospital. The necessity of some form of legal\r\nauthorization for detention is a result of the fundamental principle\r\nin English procedure that no man, against his will, may be deprived\r\nof his liberty without due process of law. This right was recognized\r\nand perpetuated by the Magna Charta signed by King John in 1215 and is\r\nvery definitely referred to in at least two different articles in the\r\nConstitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the application for commitment can be made only by certain\r\npersons definitely specified in the law,—parents, near relatives, the\r\nguardian or various public officials such as overseers of the poor.\r\nIn Massachusetts any person may sign such a petition. In Florida a\r\nrequest must be jointly made by five reputable citizens. This would\r\nnot appear to be a material point in law. Some courts require that a\r\nnotice of the application be served upon the person whose commitment\r\nis requested. In New York a notice must be served at least one day\r\nprior to the hearing of the case unless the judge personally certifies\r\nthat substituted service has been made upon some other person or that\r\npersonal service was considered inadvisable for some adequate reason\r\nnoted and has therefore been dispensed with. The Arizona law requires\r\nthe judge to hold a hearing and have the alleged insane person before\r\nhim for examination. In California a jury trial may be requested and\r\na commitment made only on a verdict of insanity requiring a vote of\r\nat least three-fourths of the jurors. A trial by jury may be asked\r\nfor in Colorado, Connecticut and many other states and must be\r\ngranted. Trial by jury is necessary in all cases in Georgia. Provision\r\nis usually made for an appeal to some higher court. In many states\r\nhearings are mandatory, in others they are optional with the court. In\r\nIowa each county has a board of three commissioners of insanity, one\r\nof whom must be a physician. They have full authority under the law\r\nto make commitments to institutions. Hearings are required in Kansas\r\nbut inquests in lunacy may be either by jury or commission at the\r\ndiscretion of the court. In Kentucky inquests in lunacy must be held by\r\nthe Circuit Court of a county. The hearings are always in the presence\r\nof a jury. In Louisiana two physicians must examine the patient in the\r\npresence of the court. If the physicians do not agree the judge himself\r\ndecides the case. In Maine parents and guardians may send insane\r\nminors to an institution without a commitment. Other insane persons\r\nare subject to examination by the municipal officers of towns. In\r\nMississippi the Chancery Courts have jurisdiction over writs of lunacy\r\nand an inquest may be made by jury. Nebraska has three commissioners in\r\ninsanity in each county, appointed by the judge of the District Court.\r\nIn the case of persons found insane they issue a warrant authorizing\r\nadmission to a state hospital. Each county in New Jersey has a\r\ncommissioner in lunacy, who has jurisdiction over the steps relating\r\nto admission to institutions. Commitments are made by the judge of a\r\nCourt of Record. All orders for commitments in North Carolina must be\r\nmade by the clerk of a Superior Court. No person who has moved into the\r\nstate while insane is deemed a resident. North Dakota has a board of\r\nthree commissioners of insanity in each county, the county judge being\r\na member. The commissioners authorize hospitals to receive persons\r\nfound to be insane. Appeal may be made to a commission of three persons\r\nto be appointed by the county judge. A jury trial is provided for, on\r\ndemand, in Oklahoma. In cases of appeal the county judge must appoint\r\na commission of three, one of whom is a physician, for the examination\r\nof the patient. Examination by a commission of three is required in\r\nPennsylvania before commitment by a justice of a Court of Common Pleas\r\nor Quarter Sessions. South Dakota has a board of three commissioners\r\nof insanity in each county, the county judge being a member. An insane\r\nperson may be received in a hospital in Vermont on the certificate of\r\ntwo physicians or by the order of a County or Supreme Court without\r\na physician's certificate. Appeal may be made to the state board\r\nof control. In Virginia the committing judge and two physicians\r\nconstitute a commission for the examination of alleged insane persons.\r\nIn West Virginia there is a county commission of lunacy composed\r\nof the president and clerk of the County Court and the prosecuting\r\nattorney. Commitments are ordered by the commission. On the arrival\r\nof the patient at a hospital a board composed of the Superintendent\r\nand assistant physicians must be convened for the examination of the\r\npatient. Application for commitment must be made in Wisconsin by three\r\nreputable citizens. The determination of insanity in Wyoming must be\r\nmade in all instances by a jury of six men.\r\n\r\nWhen an insane person has been committed to an institution it is\r\nsometimes the duty of an officer of the court to accompany the patient\r\nto the hospital. The order of the court in Massachusetts includes\r\nthe following:—\"Now, Therefore, You, the said Sheriff, Deputies,\r\nConstables or Police Officers, and each of you, with necessary\r\nassistance, ... are hereby commanded, in the name of the Commonwealth\r\nof Massachusetts, forthwith to convey the said —— to the hospital\r\naforesaid, and to deliver h— to the Superintendent thereof, and make\r\ndue return of a copy of this precept with your doings therein.\" This\r\npractically amounts to a warrant of arrest and makes the removal of\r\nthe patient to the hospital to all intents and purposes analogous to a\r\ncriminal proceeding.\r\n\r\nAttention should be called to one of the very excellent and humane\r\nprovisions of the New York Law:—\"All county superintendents of the\r\npoor, overseers of the poor, health officers and other city, town or\r\ncounty authorities, having duties to perform relating to the poor,\r\nare charged with the duty of seeing that all poor and indigent insane\r\npersons within their respective municipalities, are timely granted\r\nthe necessary relief conferred by this chapter. The poor officers or\r\nauthorities above specified, except in the city of New York and in the\r\ncounty of Albany, shall notify the health officer of the town, city\r\nor village of any poor or indigent insane or apparently insane person\r\nwithin such municipality whom they know to be in need of the relief\r\nconferred by this chapter. When so notified, or when otherwise informed\r\nof such fact, the health officer of the city, town or village, except\r\nin the city of New York and the county of Albany, where such insane or\r\napparently insane person may be, shall see that proceedings are taken\r\nfor the determination of his mental condition and for his commitment\r\nto a state hospital. Such health officer may direct the proper poor\r\nofficer to make an application for such commitment, and, if a qualified\r\nmedical examiner, may join in making the required certificate of\r\nlunacy. When so directed by such health officer it shall be the duty\r\nof the said poor officer to make such application for commitment. When\r\nnotified or informed of any poor or indigent insane or apparently\r\ninsane person in need of the relief conferred by this chapter such\r\nhealth officer shall provide for the proper care, treatment and nursing\r\nof such person, as provided by law and the rules of the commission,\r\npending the determination of his mental condition and his commitment\r\nand until the delivery of such insane person to the attendant sent to\r\nbring him to the state hospital, as provided in this chapter.\"\r\n\r\nIn New York City these responsibilities are delegated to the trustees\r\nof Bellevue and Allied Hospitals and in the county of Albany to the\r\nCommissioner of Public Charities. In New York City a medical examiner\r\nor nurse from the psychopathic wards of Bellevue Hospital, or both,\r\nmay be sent \"to the place where the alleged insane person resides\r\nor is to be found.\" If in the opinion of this examiner medical care\r\nis necessary, the patient is taken to the psychopathic ward for\r\nobservation for a period of not to exceed ten days. When a person has\r\nbeen committed to a state hospital in New York, the Superintendent\r\nis required by law to send a trained nurse or attendant to bring the\r\npatient to the institution. The desirability of having such cases under\r\nthe immediate care of nurses who have had psychiatric training would\r\nseem to be obvious. There is no reason why persons suffering from\r\nmental diseases should be subjected to the same form of supervision\r\nthat is given to criminals. The New York plan of holding the health\r\nofficer responsible for providing proper hospital care and treatment\r\nfor mental cases not coming directly under the legal jurisdiction of\r\nother persons or officials is well worthy of serious consideration.\r\nThere would appear to be no reason why the health officer should not\r\nbe responsible for mental conditions in somewhat the same way that he\r\nis for communicable diseases. Nor is there any public official to whom\r\nthe supervision of the insane pending commitment can more logically be\r\ndelegated.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-nine states voluntary patients may be received by state\r\nhospitals. The provisions of the law usually are that the patient must\r\nmake application on his own initiative, that his mental condition\r\nmust be such as to understand the purpose of this proceeding and\r\nthe need of treatment and that he must be released on a demand in\r\nwriting in from three to seven days of such request. In the twelve\r\nfollowing states the temporary care of the insane in jails, usually\r\nas an emergency measure, is still authorized:—Arkansas, Colorado,\r\nGeorgia, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota,\r\nVirginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Arrangements of some kind\r\nfor the emergency care of cases pending examination and commitment\r\nare provided for in Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma,\r\nPennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin.\r\nMassachusetts has the most comprehensive provisions for temporary care\r\nand observation. The Superintendent of a state hospital may receive and\r\ndetain, for not more than five days without a court order, any person\r\nwhose case is \"certified to be one of violent and dangerous insanity\r\nor of other emergency\" by two qualified medical examiners. Officers\r\nauthorized to serve a criminal process, or police officers, must, on\r\nthe request of the applicant or one of the examining physicians, bring\r\nsuch a person to the hospital. The applicant for this form of admission\r\nmust within five days arrange for the commitment of the person so\r\nreceived, or for his removal from the hospital.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Massachusetts Law a person found by two\r\nqualified examiners to be in such mental condition that his admission\r\nto a hospital for the insane is necessary for his proper care or\r\nobservation may be committed for a period of thirty-five days \"pending\r\nthe determination of his insanity.\" The superintendent must discharge\r\nsuch a person within thirty days if not insane or report to the\r\ncommitting judge his opinion that the patient's mental condition is\r\nsuch as to require a further residence in the hospital necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the so-called \"Boston Police Act\" (chapter 307\r\nof the Acts of 1910) all persons suffering from delirium, mania, mental\r\nconfusion, delusions or hallucinations, under arrest or \"who come under\r\nthe care or protection of the police of the city of Boston\" shall be\r\ntaken to the Psychopathic Hospital \"in the same manner in which persons\r\nafflicted with other diseases are taken to a general hospital.\" Cases\r\nsuffering from delirium tremens or drunkenness may be refused by\r\nthe hospital authorities; otherwise, all such persons are admitted,\r\nobserved and cared for \"until they can be committed or admitted to the\r\nhospital or institution appropriate in each particular case\" unless the\r\npatient recovers or is discharged.\r\n\r\nUnder the provisions of the Massachusetts Law \"No person suffering from\r\ninsanity, mental derangement, delirium or mental confusion, except\r\ndelirium tremens and drunkenness, shall, except in case of emergency,\r\nbe placed or detained in a lockup, police station, city prison, house\r\nof detention, jail or other penal institution, or place for the\r\ndetention of criminals. If, in case of emergency, any such person is\r\nso placed or detained, he shall forthwith be examined by a physician\r\nand shall be furnished suitable medical care and nursing and shall not\r\nbe so detained for more than twelve hours.\" In Boston these cases are\r\nsent to the Psychopathic Hospital. In other parts of the state they\r\nare cared for by the board of health of the city or town in question\r\nuntil they can be committed to a hospital or cared for by relatives or\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of a state hospital, under the authority of chapter\r\n123 of the General Laws, \"When requested by a physician, by a member of\r\nthe board of health or a police officer of a city or town, by an agent\r\nof the institutions registration department of the city of Boston, or\r\nby a member of the district police 'may' receive and care for in such\r\nhospital as a patient, for a period not exceeding ten days, any person\r\nwho needs immediate care and treatment because of mental derangement\r\nother than delirium tremens or drunkenness.\" Such cases are received\r\non application in writing filed at the time of the reception of the\r\npatient or within twenty-four hours thereafter and must be discharged\r\nor committed within ten days unless they make a request for voluntary\r\ncare. During 1920 there were 1,929 temporary care cases reported by the\r\nvarious Massachusetts state hospitals, as follows:\r\n\r\nBoston State Hospital (Psychopathic Department) 1,049, Danvers 217,\r\nNorthampton 188, Worcester 159, Taunton 154, Westborough 68, Foxborough\r\n56, Medfield 33, Grafton 2, and Gardner State Colony 3.\r\n\r\nNowhere else in the country has this particular form of legislation\r\nbeen used so extensively. It is something more than a mere\r\nauthorization for the reception of mental cases in observation or\r\ndetention wards. Under its provisions, at the request of any reputable\r\npracticing physician and without further legal formalities, mental\r\ncases may be cared for in a state hospital until their condition\r\ncan be definitely determined and arrangements made for their proper\r\ndisposition and treatment. The criticism to which this plan is open is\r\nthat the period of time, ten days, is not long enough. It should be\r\nextended to thirty days at least.\r\n\r\nThe provision of the Massachusetts Law for the determination of the\r\nmental condition of persons under arrest or held under criminal charges\r\nis an excellent one and well worthy of consideration. This is covered\r\nby chapter 123 of the General Laws:—\"If a person under complaint\r\nor indictment for any crime, is, at the time appointed for trial or\r\nsentence, or at any time prior thereto, found by the Court to be\r\ninsane or in such mental condition that his commitment to a hospital\r\nfor the insane is necessary for the proper care or observation of\r\nsuch person pending the determination of his insanity, the Court may\r\ncommit him to a State hospital for the insane under such limitations\r\nas it may order.\" The Court may in its discretion employ one or more\r\nexperts to examine such persons. These cases are on recovery returned\r\nby the hospital authorities to the custody of the Court. One of the\r\ninteresting features of the Massachusetts Law is the provision relating\r\nto persons indicted for murder or manslaughter but acquitted by a jury\r\nby reason of insanity. Such cases are committed to a state hospital\r\nfor life and can be discharged only by the Governor of the state, with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Executive Council, when he is satisfied,\r\nafter an investigation by the Department of Mental Diseases, that such\r\na person may be discharged \"without danger to others.\" Persons charged\r\nwith a crime \"other than murder or manslaughter\" and acquitted by a\r\njury by reason of insanity may also be committed by the Court to a\r\nstate hospital \"under such limitations as it deems proper\" and such\r\norders may be revoked at any time.\r\n\r\nA recent enactment (Chapter 415, Acts of 1921) provides that \"Whenever\r\na person is indicted by a grand jury for a capital offense or whenever\r\na person, who is known to have been indicted for any other offense more\r\nthan once or to have been previously convicted of a felony, is indicted\r\nby a grand jury or bound over for trial in the superior court, the\r\nclerk of the court in which the indictment is returned, or the clerk of\r\nthe district court or the trial justice, as the case may be, shall give\r\nnotice to the department of mental diseases, and the department shall\r\ncause such person to be examined with a view to determine his mental\r\ncondition and the existence of any mental disease or defect which would\r\naffect his criminal responsibility. The department shall file a report\r\nof its investigation with the clerk of the court in which the trial\r\nis to be held, and the report shall be accessible to the court, the\r\ndistrict attorney and to the attorney for the accused, and shall be\r\nadmissible as evidence of the mental condition of the accused.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole question of methods of commitment was made the subject of an\r\nextended study by the National Committee for Mental Hygiene in 1919. A\r\ncomprehensive report covering such legislation as was deemed necessary\r\nwas submitted by a committee consisting of the following:—Dr. George\r\nM. Kline, Commissioner, Massachusetts State Department of Mental\r\nDiseases; Dr. Charles W. Pilgrim, Chairman of the New York State\r\nHospital Commission; Dr. Owen Copp, Superintendent, Pennsylvania\r\nHospital, Department for Nervous and Mental Diseases: Dr. Frank P.\r\nNorbury, of the Board of Public Welfare Commissioners of Illinois;\r\nand Dr. Frankwood E. Williams, Associate Medical Director, National\r\nCommittee for Mental Hygiene. In addition to the ordinary form of\r\ncommitment by a court of record in a civil proceeding, they recommended\r\nlegislation in all states authorizing temporary and emergency care,\r\nobservation pending the determination of insanity, and voluntary\r\nadmissions. In a general way, the legislation recommended followed the\r\nlines of the present laws of Massachusetts and New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STATE HOSPITALS—THEIR ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the hospital is very largely a reflection of its\r\norganization, administration and personnel, but the material equipment\r\nof the institution and the financial resources available are factors of\r\nno less importance. The future of a hospital is often settled for all\r\ntime by the degree of judgment exercised in determining its location.\r\nThe founders must be guided to a very great extent by the purposes\r\nwhich they hope to accomplish. In the location of a public institution\r\nof any considerable size, however, there are certain considerations\r\nwhich, if overlooked, will eventually lead to serious difficulties. The\r\ninitial cost of the property is unfortunately a factor which cannot be\r\ndisregarded. It is usually considered desirable for obvious reasons\r\nto choose a site somewhat removed from great centers of population. A\r\nsufficient acreage must be obtained to guarantee an adequate amount of\r\nland for farming and gardening on a fairly large scale. This not only\r\ninsures a ready occupation for patients, but will materially reduce\r\nthe cost of maintenance. A point which should never be lost sight of\r\nis the necessity of choosing a location which can be reached easily by\r\nrailroads, trolley cars and motor trucks. The hospital must be readily\r\naccessible to the relatives and friends of patients. It is equally\r\nimportant that it should be convenient for employees; otherwise an\r\nadequate force of nurses and attendants can only be maintained with\r\ngreat difficulty. Above all, the hospital should be in the community\r\nwhich it is destined to serve. The patients should not be removed\r\nto any great distance from their homes. In numerous instances severe\r\nhardships have been inflicted upon all persons concerned owing to the\r\nfact that state institutions have been located in districts where they\r\nare not needed by the community and where they cannot be easily reached.\r\n\r\nEvery large public hospital should be in almost immediate contact with\r\na railroad. Otherwise thousands of dollars must be expended annually\r\nfor the transportation of coal, food and other necessary supplies.\r\nThe fertility of the soil to be used for agricultural purposes is\r\nonly second in importance to the necessity of obtaining satisfactory\r\nbuilding sites. A practically unlimited supply of pure water is\r\nabsolutely essential. The possibility of utilizing some existing system\r\nof sewerage or providing the institution with one of its own should be\r\ngiven serious consideration. Drainage must be provided for and sanitary\r\nsurroundings obtained. There should always be opportunity for future\r\nexpansion of the plant. Practically every state of any importance\r\nhas at least one institution which has been seriously handicapped\r\nthroughout its entire existence by an unfortunate neglect of one or\r\nmore of these important considerations.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 a special commission was appointed by the Governor of New York\r\nfor the purpose of preparing an intelligent and comprehensive plan for\r\nthe future development of the institutions of the state. In a report\r\npresented during the following year the commission called attention\r\nto a phase of hospital construction the importance of which cannot be\r\ntoo strongly emphasized.[27] \"Nearly all of the state hospitals suffer\r\nfrom the fact that as originally planned they were smaller institutions\r\nand of a different type from those that are now desired, and the\r\nadditions which have been made from time to time during the past\r\ntwenty-five years, in order to meet the immediate demands for increased\r\nspace, have not always been made with a completed and well rounded\r\ninstitution in mind. The results are badly balanced institutions,\r\nlacking in efficiency and ease of administration.... In planning a\r\nhospital for the insane the ultimate maximum capacity should be decided\r\nupon even if it is not possible to build the entire institution at\r\nonce. A well co-ordinated plan should then be developed, which would\r\npermit the building of various sections as appropriations become\r\navailable, with the idea of finally having a complete institution,\r\nharmonious in arrangement, and so planned as to attain the most\r\ndesirable classification and the maximum of efficiency and economy in\r\nadministration.\" The classification of the population which an average\r\nstate hospital should provide buildings for is shown by the commission\r\nas follows:—Reception building, six per cent; convalescents, four\r\nper cent; hospital buildings, two per cent; buildings for the infirm,\r\neight per cent; noisy, disturbed, etc., twenty per cent; epileptics,\r\nthree per cent; working patients, forty per cent; quiet, clean and\r\nappreciative chronic class, fourteen per cent; and tuberculous,\r\nthree per cent. They also suggest that every hospital should have a\r\nsmall isolation building for the care of contagious diseases. Their\r\nrecommendation as to the amount of floor space per patient in the\r\nvarious buildings is exceedingly interesting and no less important.\r\n\"First, That single rooms should have about eighty square feet of\r\nfloor space. A room seven feet by eleven or eight by ten, while large\r\nenough for one bed, a bureau and a chair, is not large enough to permit\r\nplacing two beds end to end or alongside of each other. If a room\r\nmeasures ten feet by twelve, there is always a temptation to place\r\ntwo beds in it if the hospital becomes crowded, and the advantage\r\nof single rooms is wholly lost. The number of single rooms in an\r\ninstitution should be from fifteen per cent to twenty per cent of the\r\npopulation, varying with the character of the cases to be cared for.\r\nSecond, Dormitories should have above fifty square feet of floor space\r\nper patient, and no dormitory should have more than fifty beds nor\r\nless than six. This, of course, applies to the wards for the chronic\r\ncases. An adequate system of ventilation throughout the hospital is\r\npresupposed. Third, The day space allotted should provide forty to\r\nfifty square feet per patient. Fourth, The dining room allowance should\r\nbe from fourteen to sixteen square feet per patient, in order to permit\r\nthe use of small tables and to provide adequate passages for the\r\nexpeditious service of food.\"\r\n\r\nIn former years much time and space was devoted to a discussion of the\r\nrespective merits of the congregate type of hospital construction, the\r\nso-called \"Kirkbride\" or block plan (although it was in use long before\r\nKirkbride described it) and the arrangement of buildings in groups.\r\nThere is no question but what an institution that is all under one roof\r\ncan be administered much more economically and operated at a lower\r\nmaintenance cost. Very little, if any, advantage is derived by the\r\npatient from the group scheme. In its practical operation in the state\r\nhospitals almost the only point of difference, as far as the patient\r\nis concerned, is that he must go out of doors as a rule to get to the\r\ndining room in the summer as well as in the winter, in good weather and\r\nbad. This has been responsible for much discomfort and has resulted in\r\na great increase in the number of escapes. When buildings are arranged\r\nin groups they should be connected with a central dining room either\r\nby corridors or tunnels. Small cottages, except for special purposes,\r\nare out of the question as far as state institutions are concerned, on\r\naccount of the cost involved. As a matter of fact, in the development\r\nof a large hospital all types of construction must be ultimately\r\nemployed. The reception building should be separate and detached\r\nfrom the other parts of the hospital, as should, of course, the wards\r\nfor the tuberculous cases, the contagious building, the building for\r\nconvalescents, the farm cottages, etc. The noisy and violent patients\r\ncertainly should be in separate buildings far enough away so that they\r\nwill not disturb others. The hospital wards, for the exclusive care of\r\nbed patients, may well be detached. The larger part of the hospital\r\npopulation, consisting of the quiet, orderly, chronic, custodial cases,\r\ncan be cared for just as well in the large buildings as in groups or\r\ncottages.\r\n\r\nThe reception building, from the standpoint of the patient, is the\r\nmost important building in the hospital. It should be equipped to care\r\nfor from five to ten per cent of the hospital population, depending\r\nentirely upon the location and special problems of the institution in\r\nquestion and the community which it serves. In any event it should\r\ninclude both large and small dormitories, the larger accommodating\r\nfrom fifteen to thirty patients, and the smaller not more than six or\r\neight, adequate day-room space, numerous single rooms and commodious\r\nenclosed verandas. There should, of course, be ample dining room\r\nfacilities as well as diet rooms to provide for those whose condition\r\nmakes it necessary or advisable for them to be served in the wards.\r\nSpecial provision should be made for the separate care of the noisy,\r\nviolent, disturbed, etc., and they should be in a part of the building\r\nwhich can be isolated. The suicidal cases must be given special care\r\nand separate supervision. A well equipped hydrotherapeutic department\r\nis an essential part of the reception building. Continuous bath and\r\npack rooms are equally necessary. No less important are admission and\r\nexamination rooms, a pharmacy, laboratories, rooms for the special\r\ntreatment of eye, ear, nose and throat conditions, recreation rooms, a\r\nlibrary, space for occupational therapy, provision for social service\r\nand psychological departments, etc. At least two physicians should\r\nreside in the building. It is unfortunate that reception buildings as\r\na rule are entirely too small. They should be large enough so that the\r\nacute and recoverable cases, as well as those found on observation not\r\nto require hospital treatment, can be returned to their homes without\r\nany further contact with the hospital or the necessity of a protracted\r\nresidence with the chronic and purely custodial cases.\r\n\r\nThe experience of many years has shown quite conclusively that the\r\nsupervision and general direction of a hospital for mental diseases\r\nshould be delegated to a medical superintendent with such clinical and\r\nadministrative assistants as the nature and size of the institution\r\nmay indicate. The dual system of management frequently suggested\r\nby politicians, with a layman as the executive head and a medical\r\ndirector subordinated to his authority, has proved to be a failure\r\nin every instance in which it has been tried. The administrative\r\ndetails necessary to the successful operation of a large institution\r\nare such as to require the entire time and attention not only of the\r\nsuperintendent but usually of an assistant superintendent. In a large\r\nhospital the activities of the medical staff should be under the\r\nimmediate supervision of a specialist whose training and experience\r\nqualify him to direct the clinical and psychiatric work of others.\r\nThis is a quite sufficient task to require the constant attention and\r\nundivided energies of a clinical director who has no other interests\r\nor responsibilities. In this way recent graduates with proper\r\nqualifications may be interested in entering the psychiatric field.\r\nEvery state hospital, in addition to fulfilling its entire duty to the\r\npatients in its charge, should be a training school for psychiatrists,\r\nsocial workers, psychologists, occupational therapists and psychiatric\r\nnurses. The hospital staff, as well as providing for the services of\r\nphysicians well trained in psychiatry, must include other specialists.\r\nA hospital of any size should have a staff of consulting and visiting\r\nphysicians including several internists and surgeons, a gynecologist, a\r\nneurologist, a dermatologist, an ophthalmologist, a laryngologist and\r\nan otologist. These consultants should visit the hospital regularly and\r\ndirect and supervise the work of the resident staff along the lines\r\nof their specialty. It is hardly necessary to suggest today that a\r\nhospital of any size without a resident dentist is one which is not\r\nproperly equipped to care for its patients.\r\n\r\nNothing is more important in the modern hospital than the training\r\nschool for nurses. It is the nursing care of the patients more than\r\nany other one thing perhaps that has made the difference between the\r\nold time asylum and the psychiatric hospital of the highest type. The\r\nstate hospital training school of the present day offers its pupils\r\na three years' course of instruction, including a year of practical\r\nexperience in an affiliated general hospital. Its graduates, moreover,\r\nare trained not only in psychiatric and general nursing, as well as\r\nthe care of neurological cases, but in hydrotherapy, occupational\r\ntherapy, reeducational, industrial and social work. The nurse of the\r\nfuture who has had no psychiatric training and experience is one whose\r\neducation is not complete. Every effort should be made to encourage the\r\ntraining schools of general hospitals to send their senior nurses to a\r\nhospital for mental diseases for a service of at least three months.\r\nThe specialized care and treatment of cases suffering from tuberculosis\r\nhas been neglected in many institutions. It should not be necessary to\r\nsuggest that such cases have no place in a ward with other patients\r\nwho have not contracted that disease, and yet in many of our large and\r\nimportant hospitals there are no separate buildings for that purpose.\r\nIt has been shown by statistical studies that persons suffering from\r\ndementia praecox have an unusual and remarkable susceptibility to\r\ntuberculosis. Unfortunately, it has never been possible to completely\r\nsegregate the epileptics in our public hospitals for mental diseases.\r\nThey constitute a special problem and should receive a different diet\r\nas well as an entirely different type of treatment. Their presence in\r\nthe wards with mental cases is highly detrimental to both. This is\r\nequally true of drug cases and mental defectives, and especially the\r\nso-called defective delinquents.\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons why every hospital of any consequence that\r\nis engaged in the care of mental diseases should be provided with a\r\nwell trained and experienced pathologist. Examinations of urine and\r\nsputum must be made daily. Widal tests are sometimes necessary for\r\nthe diagnosis of typhoid fever. Analyses of water and milk should\r\nbe made at frequent intervals. Bacteriological vaccines should be\r\navailable at any time. Only laboratory investigations can throw any\r\nlight on the source of the frequent infections which are found in large\r\ninstitutions. Diphtheria is a disease which must be guarded against\r\nconstantly. Lumbar punctures, Wassermann tests, the colloidal gold\r\nreaction, cell counts, etc., are daily necessities in a large hospital.\r\nWe lose much information of value to us if autopsies are neglected. A\r\ndefinite program of pathological research work should be carried on in\r\nevery hospital for mental diseases. It has been suggested frequently\r\nthat the microscope has no part to play in studying the etiology of\r\nthe psychoses and that they are purely functional in origin. Many of\r\nthem are functional. It is nevertheless equally true that we have a\r\ndefinite pathological basis for the traumatic psychoses, the senile\r\nconditions, cerebral arteriosclerosis, general paresis, brain syphilis,\r\ncerebral growths, mental deficiency and many other brain and nervous\r\ndiseases. The psychosis most clearly understood from the standpoint of\r\netiology, pathology, symptomatology and diagnosis is general paresis.\r\nOur definite knowledge of that condition was obtained entirely from the\r\nlaboratory. Further information may be secured in the same way. While\r\nit is true that we have not had any great amount of success as yet with\r\nthe treatment of general paresis with salvarsan, the positive knowledge\r\nthat the disease is of syphilitic origin should encourage us in our\r\nefforts to solve the problem of curing it. Histological, pathological,\r\nbacteriological, chemical, clinical and psychological researches must\r\nbe pushed vigorously if psychiatry is to keep pace with the general\r\nprogress shown by modern medicine in other fields.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject some reference should be made to\r\nthe general neglect of statistical studies. They should be based on\r\ndetailed, accurate and exhaustive clinical records, which unfortunately\r\nare not now available to the extent that they should be. It is true\r\nthat in a general way some progress has been made. The studies\r\ninstituted by the American Psychiatric Association will ultimately\r\ntell us quite definitely the frequency of the various psychoses,\r\nthe recovery and death rates to be expected, etc. We should not be\r\nsatisfied with that alone. The great wealth of material which we have\r\nin our hospitals, together with the excellent clinical and laboratory\r\nfacilities at our disposal, should enable us to accomplish much more.\r\nAn analysis of our case records, if properly made, would give us\r\ndefinite information as to the clinical aspects of the mental diseases\r\nwe are dealing with. These should be made the subject of exhaustive\r\nstudy by the scientific institutes and other research departments\r\nconducted by the various state authorities to an extent never yet\r\nundertaken or even attempted. If it cannot be done by the states it\r\nshould be instituted by the federal government.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the field of influence of our public institutions should\r\nextend far beyond the walls of the hospital is one which has received\r\ngeneral recognition only within the last few years. Every hospital\r\nhas a large number of patients still within its legal custody but who\r\nhave been allowed to return temporarily to their homes or occupations\r\nwhile still under observation pending their final discharge. These\r\nare now, to a very limited extent, under the supervision of social\r\nworkers. The hospitals have unfortunately, owing to a lack of funds,\r\nnever had a sufficient number of social workers to look after them\r\nproperly. The hospitals as a rule now maintain out-patient departments\r\nwhere those who have been allowed to go home on visit or resume their\r\noccupations are encouraged to come for assistance and advice. The\r\npublic is gradually learning to take advantage of this opportunity to\r\nobtain expert advice on matters relating to mental hygiene and secure\r\nprofessional opinions as to the disposition and treatment of members\r\nof the family showing symptoms of incipient mental disorders. This\r\nfield of influence extends even further. Clinics have been established\r\nin various locations outside of the hospitals in the larger cities\r\nin several states. In New York they are conducted by state hospital\r\nphysicians in Binghamton, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Plattsburg, Dunkirk,\r\nJamestown, Olean, Salamanca, Poughkeepsie, Peekskill, Yonkers, Mount\r\nVernon, Mineola, Newburgh, Kingston, Rochester, Middletown, Ogdensburg,\r\nMalone, Watertown, Utica, Schenectady, Ovid, Ithaca and New York City.\r\nPhysicians and social workers are in attendance at all of these places.\r\nThe last published report of the New York State Hospital Commission\r\n(1919) shows that 7,203 visits were made to these clinics during the\r\nyear. Paroled patients made 5,102 of these, discharged patients 265\r\nand others who had no connection with the hospitals at all, 1,836.\r\nIn addition to this the hospital social workers made 3,496 visits to\r\nparoled patients as well as four hundred and sixty-two visits to other\r\npatients for the purpose of preventing mental diseases. Situations\r\nwere obtained for one hundred and sixty-seven discharged patients. An\r\nenormous amount of work was also done in history taking, etc. Numerous\r\nclinics have been established in Massachusetts by the Department of\r\nMental Diseases.[28] During the year ending November 30, 1919, a total\r\nof 4,333 visits were reported. Of these 3,057 were first visits. The\r\nnumber reported by the various hospitals was as follows:—Worcester\r\nState Hospital 1,278, Taunton State Hospital 182, Northampton State\r\nHospital 458, Danvers State Hospital 282, Westborough State Hospital\r\n177, Grafton State Hospital 129, Gardner Colony 65, Monson State\r\nHospital 70, Foxborough State Hospital 27, Massachusetts School for\r\nthe Feebleminded 541, Boston State Hospital (Psychopathic Department)\r\n2,112. Clinics were maintained in the following localities:—Athol,\r\nBoston, Brockton, Danvers, Fitchburg, Foxborough, Gardner, Grafton,\r\nGloucester, Greenfield, Haverhill, Lawrence, Lynn, Malden, Medfield,\r\nMonson, New Bedford, Newburyport, Northampton, Pittsfield, Salem,\r\nSpringfield, Taunton, Waverley, Westborough, Worcester and Wrentham.\r\n\r\nThis is a gratifying evidence of progress. There are indications of an\r\nawakening. The hospital treatment of mental diseases will eventually be\r\nconducted on a much higher plane and along lines more nearly comparable\r\nto those of the general hospital. A study of legislation relating to\r\nmental disease shows that efforts are being made very generally to\r\nmake their treatment a medical problem rather than a legal question.\r\nIt has been no easy matter to obtain treatment for mental diseases,\r\nassuming a desire on the part of the individual to take advantage\r\nof such an opportunity. A review of our legal enactments shows that\r\nas a general rule it means a formal application, properly verified,\r\nan elaborate examination by two qualified physicians, an order of\r\ncommitment by the judge of a court of record, a legal notice and an\r\nopportunity for a hearing if one is demanded. Pennsylvania as early\r\nas 1883 made provision for the immediate admission of such cases as\r\nrequired it, pending the usual court procedure. As has been shown in\r\nanother chapter, arrangements have been legalized in many states for\r\nthe emergency reception of mental cases, at least for those persons\r\nwho are known to be dangerous to themselves or others. Temporary care\r\nenactments have been written into the law in various communities,\r\nmaking it possible to keep mental cases under observation for a limited\r\nperiod of time. In a large number of states it is now possible for\r\na person requesting treatment voluntarily to receive it on his own\r\napplication without any other legal formalities. Perhaps the greatest\r\nadvance is the custom, not so infrequent now, of sending persons held\r\nby courts under a criminal process to a hospital for observation as to\r\ntheir mental condition. The fact should not be lost sight of that it is\r\nstill possible to find \"insane\" persons in jails, poorhouses and county\r\ninstitutions in many parts of the country. Worse than this, however, is\r\nthe custom of delegating their care to police officers. Nevertheless,\r\ndistinct progress has been made.\r\n\r\nAs has already been shown, a study of methods of care in this country\r\nindicates that every state has passed through several very definite\r\npreliminary stages. These may be summarized as follows:—\r\n\r\n 1. A period of home care only. During the colonial days mental cases\r\n    were cared for at home or not at all. There was nothing else that\r\n    could be done for them at the time.\r\n\r\n 2. Confinement with criminals. In cases of unusual violence, dangerous\r\n    persons were confined in jails, lockups and prisons. If necessary,\r\n    under certain circumstances the law in some states even authorized the\r\n    use of chains.\r\n\r\n 3. Almshouse care. There has been a time in practically every state\r\n    when the poorhouse has been looked upon as the proper place for the\r\n    insane.\r\n\r\n 4. Asylum care. As a result of the agitation of Dorothea Dix and\r\n    others, mental diseases were eventually given custodial care in\r\n    asylums.\r\n\r\n 5. Modern hospital care.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Dr. S. Weir Mitchell[29] delivered the annual address at\r\nthe semi-centennial meeting of the American Medico-Psychological\r\nAssociation in Philadelphia. It was a very painful occasion for many.\r\nHis remarks may be summed up as a vigorous arraignment of the asylum\r\nmethods of that day. He severely criticized the public, the state\r\nlegislatures, boards of management and the hospital superintendents.\r\nHis principal charge was that they were operating asylums along the\r\nlines of the past and were perfectly satisfied with what they had\r\naccomplished. He pointed out the necessity of properly qualified\r\nphysicians, more scientific methods and modern treatment. \"We have\r\ndone with whip and chains and ill usage, and having won this noble\r\nbattle have we not rested too easily content with having made the\r\ncondition of the insane more comfortable?\" It seems incredible that\r\nin the case records of that day he should have found no evidences \"of\r\nblood counts, temperatures, reflexes, the eye-ground, color fields, all\r\nthe minute examinations with which we are so unrestingly busy.\" One\r\ninstitution was unable to furnish Dr. Mitchell with a stethoscope or\r\nan ophthalmoscope! One of his criticisms was that few institutions for\r\nmental diseases had a training school for nurses or any provisions\r\nfor hydrotherapy. His last words were almost a prophecy: \"Fifty years\r\nhence, when we must all have been swept away, another will possibly\r\nstand in my place and tell your history, and to him and the bountiful\r\nwisdom of time I leave it to be declared whether I was right or wrong.\"\r\nDr. Mitchell's description of the asylums and their methods was\r\nbitterly resented. Who is there today who would not feel that he was\r\nfully justified?\r\n\r\nThe time has come when we must again look to the future and prepare for\r\nit. The purely custodial care of mental diseases has led to a dread of\r\nasylums on the part of the public. There are unfortunately too many\r\nhospitals that are asylums in everything but name. The establishment\r\nof psychopathic hospitals and psychiatric clinics and the way in which\r\nthey have been welcomed by the public is suggestive. The problems of\r\nmental diseases, as far as possible, must be approached from a general\r\nhospital point of view and the psychiatric hospital of the future must\r\nhave a modern equipment, an efficient staff and adequate facilities\r\nfor the employment of the latest methods. Above all, the institutions\r\nmust be such that they will be looked upon by the community not merely\r\nas a place to which the insane may be sent for final disposition, but\r\nas hospitals where the development of mental diseases may be prevented\r\nand where recoveries may be reasonably expected if the patient is given\r\nearly treatment. This should be the principal object of the state\r\nhospital of the future. \"The concept of its beneficent ministration to\r\nthe mind diseased as any physical part of the human body,\" as Copp[30]\r\nhas pointed out, \"is just appearing in shadowy outline in public\r\nconsciousness. The effacement of this barrier to early treatment is\r\nslowly but steadily progressing. Its pace will be hastened if every\r\nmental hospital continues to become, as speedily as may be, the\r\nreal hospital in the broadest sense, with emphasis laid upon its\r\ntreatment function and subordination of its control relation within\r\nthe reasonable limit of caution. The mental hospital and the general\r\nhospital are essentially alike. Mental factors predominate in the\r\nformer, but are potent influences in the latter. The difference is\r\none of degree only. All the imperative requirements of the one must\r\nbe met by the other. They are supplementary agencies in curing and\r\nalleviating disease and must be, eventually, viewed in the same light\r\nand administered in the same spirit on even planes of humaneness and\r\nefficiency.\"\r\n\r\nOne thing should be made clear at the outset. A comprehensive and\r\nprogressive program for further development means an expenditure of\r\nmoney. If the state hospitals are to fulfill their obligations to the\r\ncommunity which they serve they must have more physicians. Provisions\r\nmust be made for directors of clinical psychiatry, pathologists,\r\ninternists, surgeons, dentists, and specialists of various kinds.\r\nExperts in hydrotherapy, massage and electrical treatments are\r\nnecessary, as well as dietitians, industrial instructors, occupational\r\nteachers, specialists in reeducational work, psychologists, social\r\nworkers, etc. Furthermore, they must be provided in sufficient numbers\r\nif anything is to be accomplished. As a matter of fact, no very great\r\noutlay of funds would be required in making a tremendous increase in\r\nefficiency. Although the institutional expenditures have increased\r\nenormously of late years, largely as a result of war conditions,\r\nincreased costs, higher wages, etc., the amount actually invested in\r\nthis humanitarian movement by the various states is not commensurate in\r\nany way with the results which are to be obtained. If we leave out of\r\nconsideration everything except the saving in dollars and cents to be\r\neffected by methods which will in many instances render a protracted\r\nhospital residence unnecessary, the outlay involved would be well\r\nwarranted. It should be brought to the attention of the public that\r\nvery few states are expending as much as one dollar per day for the\r\nmaintenance of the individual patient. Modern hospital treatment of the\r\nhighest type, under these circumstances, is manifestly impossible. The\r\ntime has come when we should no longer be satisfied with the purely\r\ncustodial care of mental cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE HOSPITAL TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the hospital for the future of the patient\r\nbegins with his arrival at the institution and the ultimate outcome\r\nof the case often depends entirely upon the developments of the first\r\nfew weeks of his residence in the wards. A complete understanding of\r\nthe patient's mental condition, the prospects of an ultimate recovery\r\nand the line of treatment to be followed can only be determined by a\r\nthorough and accurate examination on admission. This constitutes the\r\nbasis for all further procedure. If satisfactory results are to be\r\nobtained this task should be delegated to a medical officer who has\r\nhad an extended psychiatric experience. For purposes of completeness,\r\nas well as uniformity, a definite plan should be followed. The form\r\nused in writing the initial history and in recording the results of the\r\nroutine mental and physical examinations at the Boston State Hospital\r\nare described in full in the \"Medical Staff Manual\" which is furnished\r\nto all assistant physicians entering the service. This has been found\r\nto be of great assistance in the training of new men along proper lines\r\nand insures a uniformity of hospital records which is indispensable.\r\nIn a general way the form of examination employed by Meyer and\r\nKirby[31] for some years has been followed. As this scheme is fairly\r\nrepresentative of the method of procedure used by hospitals for mental\r\ndiseases throughout the country it has been thought worth while to\r\nreproduce it in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HISTORY\r\n\r\n  _Name of Physician_:      _Date_:\r\n\r\n _Name of Informant, Address, Relation to Patient_:\r\n\r\n It is often desirable to make a note on the intelligence and apparent\r\n reliability of the informant.\r\n\r\n _Residence and Citizenship of Patient_:\r\n\r\n Birthplace? Date of birth? Time in Massachusetts? If foreign born,\r\n date of arrival in U. S.? Naturalized or alien?\r\n\r\n _Family History_:\r\n\r\n It is not sufficient to ask simply the general question: Has any\r\n member of the family been insane or nervous? A great many persons will\r\n answer in the negative, whereas a detailed inquiry will often bring\r\n out a number of instances of nervous or mental troubles.\r\n\r\n Specific inquiry must be made concerning the persons of the direct\r\n ancestral lines as follows:\r\n\r\n (a) Paternal grandparents—nervous or mental disease?\r\n\r\n (b) Maternal grandparents—nervous or mental disease?\r\n\r\n (c) Father: Age, nervous or mental disease, alcoholism? If dead, age\r\n at death and cause of death?\r\n\r\n (d) Mother: Age, nervous or mental disease, alcoholism? If dead, age\r\n at death and cause of death?\r\n\r\n (e) Number of children in family (brothers and sisters of patient).\r\n Nervous or mental trouble in any of these besides patient?\r\n Psychopathic personality, alcoholism, criminality, etc.?\r\n\r\n (f) Collateral branches: mention any known cases of insanity or\r\n nervous diseases in uncles, aunts or cousins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PERSONAL HISTORY OF PATIENT\r\n\r\n 1. _Early Development_:\r\n\r\n Birthplace and age, unusual incidents attending birth, retardation\r\n in talking or walking, infantile convulsions, night terrors, fits of\r\n temper, etc.—Severe illness or infectious diseases in infancy or\r\n childhood—Sequella? Frights, shocks or injuries?\r\n\r\n 2. _Education, Intellectual and Moral Development_:\r\n\r\n Educational opportunities, time spent in school, interest in studies,\r\n progress, marks, behavior, truancy, etc.?\r\n\r\n As an adult, regarded as bright, intelligent or dullminded? Well\r\n informed or ignorant? Reading, memory, judgment?\r\n\r\n Moral responsibility, reliability, religious interests? Church\r\n affiliations?\r\n\r\n Criminal traits, tramp life, police record?\r\n\r\n 3. _Sexual Life_:\r\n\r\n Precocious interests in childhood, masturbation, abnormal practices,\r\n assaults or seduction?\r\n\r\n Love affairs and disappointments? Age at marriage or reasons for\r\n single life. Moderate or excessive sexual desires, irregularities or\r\n prostitution.\r\n\r\n Miscarriages, number of children, date of birth of youngest? If barren,\r\n what explanation; what effect on patient?\r\n\r\n Frigidity, loss of power, refusal of partner, infidelity, measures to\r\n prevent conception. Treatment of partner, abuse, separation, divorce.\r\n\r\n Perversions, abnormal methods of gratification with same or opposite\r\n sex.\r\n\r\n In women, unusual symptoms at menstrual periods; age at menopause,\r\n nervous symptoms accompanying climacterium?\r\n\r\n 4. _Diseases and Injuries_:\r\n\r\n Any previous nervous affection or symptoms, such as headaches, nervous\r\n prostration, chorea, epilepsy, hysterical attacks, etc.?\r\n\r\n Mention severe infections diseases and sequella, if any. Inquire\r\n concerning tuberculosis, rheumatism, heart disease, nephritis, etc.\r\n\r\n Venereal disease, _syphilis and gonorrhea_, full account, if possible,\r\n of how acquired, age, treatment and after affects.\r\n\r\n Severe injuries, particularly head traumata, should be described as\r\n regards their immediate and subsequent effects.\r\n\r\n 5. _Occupation_:\r\n\r\n Kinds of work undertaken, ambition, efficiency, wages, etc. Length of\r\n time in different positions, reasons for change, etc.\r\n\r\n 6. _Alcoholism and Other Toxic Influences_:\r\n\r\n Intemperate, moderate or total abstainer? If intemperate, age at which\r\n drinking began, apparent cause of same, kind of beverage consumed and\r\n approximate amounts. Periodic or steady drinker? Usual reaction to\r\n alcohol?\r\n\r\n Inquire about attacks of neuritis, delirium, hallucinatory episodes,\r\n suspicions, ideas of jealousy.\r\n\r\n _Other toxic influences_: Drug habits, occupational poisons, lead,\r\n arsenic, phosphorus, mercury, etc. Illuminating gas poisoning, nicotine\r\n intoxication.\r\n\r\n 7. _Mental Make-up or Type of Personality_:\r\n\r\n Very important because certain of the non-organic psychoses appear\r\n to be a further development of mental traits or tendencies early\r\n recognized as personal peculiarities or deviations from the normal. In\r\n addition to the points already covered under the preceding headings,\r\n the following important types should always be borne in mind and\r\n appropriate inquiries made:\r\n\r\n _Manic make-up_: Lively, active, sociable, pushing, talkative,\r\n cheerful, optimistic; may be domineering, irritable and inclined to\r\n cruelty; sometimes not very efficient, may be noted as changeable,\r\n lacking in persistence, concentration and application. May show\r\n transient blue spells or lowering of spirits.\r\n\r\n _Depressive make-up_: Gloomy, worrisome, blue natures who feel\r\n continuously inhibited or restrained and unable to make decisions;\r\n easily discouraged.\r\n\r\n _Cyclothymic make-up_: Emotionally unstable, either up or down, have\r\n blue spells or are unduly cheerful and care-free.\r\n\r\n _Shut-in make-up_: Shy, retiring, self-conscious, bashful, quiet,\r\n secretive, seclusive and unsociable. Lack of interest in opposite\r\n sex or definite aversion; often prudish and over-particular. Unusual\r\n religious interest frequent. Inclined to day-dreaming, show fondness\r\n for the abstract and mystical. Odd habits, hobbies or cranky pursuits\r\n are common.\r\n\r\n _Paranoid make-up_: Mistrustful, suspicious, tend to misunderstand;\r\n unduly sensitive, feel discriminated against and have feelings of\r\n self-importance. (These traits may be related to shut-in tendencies.)\r\n\r\n Other types of make-up include the psychasthenic, neurasthenic and\r\n hysterical; also the mentally retarded or undeveloped (feebleminded).\r\n\r\n 8. _Previous Attacks of Mental Disorder_:\r\n\r\n Obtain dates, places where treated, apparent cause, duration of attacks\r\n and general character of symptoms.\r\n\r\n 9. _Precipitating Cause of Present Psychosis_:\r\n\r\n Try to determine what occurrence or situation appeared to bring\r\n about the mental breakdown. Emotional strains, excitement, quarrels,\r\n worries, griefs, disappointments, sexual episodes, separation, deaths,\r\n childbirth, etc., financial loss, overwork, physical disease, etc.\r\n\r\n 10. _Onset and Symptoms of the Psychosis_:\r\n\r\n Take as far as possible a spontaneous account beginning with date\r\n when first symptoms were noticed in the patient. In this connection\r\n particular attention should be given to changes in behavior, in mood,\r\n in manner of speech, in attitude towards others and towards work.\r\n\r\n Appearance of suspicious, unusual interests, peculiar ideas and\r\n delusions?\r\n\r\n Hallucinations in various fields and reaction to them?\r\n\r\n Obtain as much as possible regarding trend of patient's ideas, topics\r\n of conversation and content of hallucinations. What did voices say?\r\n What was seen in visions?\r\n\r\n Forgetfulness, impairment of memory, loss of orientation and clouding\r\n of sensorium.\r\n\r\n Always inquire regarding suicidal inclinations or attempts, threats of\r\n violence, assaults or homicidal tendencies.\r\n\r\n Compare informant's statement with those given in the commitment\r\n certificate.\r\n\r\n What treatment was given at home? Name of physician in attendance?\r\n\r\n Date on which patient was taken to hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PHYSICAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\n I. _GENERAL TYPE, APPEARANCE AND CONDITION_:\r\n\r\n 1.

They are quite inclined to feel\r\nthat if no medicines are being prescribed nothing is being done for\r\nthe patient and that he could be cared for just as well at home.\r\nIn considering this question it should be borne in mind that the\r\npersons under treatment in a hospital for mental diseases are there,\r\neither because they appreciate the need of hospital care themselves,\r\nor because, as a result of mental disorders, they are incapable of\r\ndirecting their own affairs, or are, in the eyes of the law, dangerous\r\nto themselves or others. Their property and other legal interests must\r\nbe protected during their period of incompetence. Such persons are\r\nliable, if not adequately safeguarded, to enter into improper contracts\r\nor make legal conveyances that mean financial ruin to themselves as\r\nwell as others. Unfortunate sexual irregularities frequently occur.\r\nConduct disorders of various kinds are to be expected and a tendency\r\ntowards criminal acts is common to several of the psychoses. It\r\nis a well-known fact that every mentally unbalanced individual is\r\npotentially dangerous, no matter how harmless he may appear. The\r\nsuicide rate of the country as shown in one hundred of the largest\r\ncities has not fallen below fourteen per hundred thousand of the sane\r\npopulation at any time during the last twenty years. The homicide rate\r\nin thirty-one of our large cities has not dropped below eight per\r\nhundred thousand of the population since 1909. Many of these crimes\r\nwere undoubtedly committed by persons who should not have been at\r\nlarge and who were not responsible for their acts. The most important\r\nbenefit derived by the patient in the hospital is the constant personal\r\nsupervision given him by experts throughout the twenty-four hours\r\nof the day, whether he is asleep or awake. He gets the benefit of\r\nregular hours of rest and exercise, a properly regulated diet adapted\r\nto his needs, a sufficient amount of fresh air, and amusement and\r\nentertainments suited to his mental condition. He receives competent\r\nmedical, dental and nursing care and is provided with opportunities\r\nfor occupying himself in many different ways. Reading matter is always\r\navailable for those who care for it. Even religious services are held\r\nfor his benefit.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of late years is to dispense with the use of drugs as\r\nfar as possible and resort to other methods of accomplishing the same\r\nresults. One of the most important therapeutic procedures in common use\r\nin the modern hospital for mental diseases is hydrotherapy. This should\r\nbe used intelligently if any results are expected. Sending the patient\r\nto the hydriatic department where identically the same treatment is\r\napplied to all cases whether of excitement, depression, exhaustion,\r\netc., by an attendant who has no knowledge of either medicine,\r\npsychiatry or nursing may be referred to as the application of water to\r\nthe exterior, but it is not hydrotherapy. Hydriatic treatments should\r\nbe prescribed by a physician who has a thorough familiarity with that\r\nparticular therapeutic procedure and every patient should receive the\r\nform adapted to his individual needs. The treatment should be given\r\nby an expert hydrotherapist. The equipment should provide for hot\r\nair, electric light, vapor and saline baths, Sitz baths, circular,\r\nrain, fan, jet and Scotch douches, dry, hot and cold packs, etc. Much\r\ncan be accomplished by tonic, stimulating and eliminative therapy.\r\nSedative treatments are much used in hospitals for mental diseases.\r\nThe hot air bath[32] is given at from 134 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit for\r\nfrom four to ten minutes, preceded by a foot bath at from 104 to 110\r\ndegrees. The patient enters the electric light and vapor bath at the\r\nroom temperature, the baths being continued from four to eight minutes\r\nusually. The needle spray is given at a temperature ranging from 96\r\nto 102 degrees, with a pressure of from twenty to thirty pounds, and\r\ncontinued from one to two minutes. The fan douche starts at 90 degrees,\r\nis reduced gradually with a pressure of from twenty to twenty-five\r\npounds and is continued for from fifteen to twenty seconds. The jet\r\ndouche is first used at 90 degrees and gradually reduced, with a\r\npressure of from fifteen to twenty-five pounds, for from ten to twenty\r\nseconds. The Scotch douche is used at a temperature of 80 degrees\r\nalternating with 110, with from fifteen to thirty pounds pressure. It\r\nshould be used with extreme care. The same is true of vapor douches.\r\nThe saline bath contains five pounds of ordinary salt to sixty gallons\r\nof water at a temperature of 94 degrees and is continued from ten\r\nto thirty minutes. The dry pack is usually continued from twenty to\r\nforty-five minutes, although it may be used longer with safety. In the\r\nuse of the hot blanket pack the inner blanket is wrung out of water at\r\nfrom 140 to 160 degrees and must be applied with great care. Depending\r\non the condition of the patient, etc., the cold wet pack is given\r\nwith sheets wrung out of water at a temperature ranging from 50 to 60\r\ndegrees, although lower temperature may be used. \"Neutral\" wet sheet\r\npacks are often used at a temperature of from 100 to 116 degrees for\r\napproximately three-quarters of an hour, as preparatory treatments.\r\nThese measures should never be attempted by anyone who has not had an\r\nextended practical experience. Much can be accomplished by hydrotherapy\r\nin the alcoholic and toxic conditions, infective and exhaustive\r\npsychoses, manic excitements, involutional melancholia, hysterical and\r\nneurasthenic conditions, as well as in occasional cases of dementia\r\npraecox. Occupational therapy has been used to great advantage in\r\nconnection with the hydrotherapeutic treatments.\r\n\r\nIn the reception service and in the buildings for the noisy and violent\r\ncases ample facilities should be at hand for the continuous bath\r\ntreatments. Pack rooms are also desirable. There is no means at our\r\ndisposal equal in any way to the efficacy of the continuous bath in\r\ncontrolling excitements. The patient is usually kept in the tub from\r\nfive to eight hours at a temperature varying from 92 to 97 degrees and\r\naveraging 96 degrees. In some hospitals they are kept in the tubs for\r\nperiods of from two to three weeks. The continuous bath is of no value\r\nunless it means what the name implies—the continuous submersion of the\r\nbody in water. In dealing with very excited cases this necessitates\r\nthe use of a tub cover and a hammock, although sheet coverings are\r\noften used satisfactorily. Not much is to be gained by the tub bath if\r\nthe patient is to be allowed to get out and in as he pleases and only\r\ncome into partial contact with the water. The continuous bath is not\r\nwithout drawbacks. There is danger of chilling, scalding and drowning\r\neither by accident or with suicidal intent, etc. Too much care cannot\r\nbe exercised in the supervision of the bath rooms. Every tub room\r\nin the Boston State Hospital has the following rules conspicuously\r\ndisplayed:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE CONTINUOUS BATH ROOM\r\n\r\n 1. The nurse on duty in the bath room will be held personally\r\n    responsible for the safety of the patients and must be thoroughly\r\n    familiar with these rules. The nurse must never leave the room unless\r\n    relieved by some other nurse. Eternal vigilance is necessary to\r\n    prevent the chilling, scalding or drowning of the patient.\r\n\r\n 2. Patients are to be given continuous baths only on the written order\r\n    of a physician.\r\n\r\n 3. Patients going to or from the bath room must wear a nightdress or\r\n    bathrobe and slippers when not fully clothed.\r\n\r\n 4. Tubs not in good condition or not properly equipped must not be\r\n    used.\r\n\r\n 5. Only patients under treatment are allowed in the room.\r\n\r\n 6. Toilet each patient just before the bath. Patients may be removed\r\n    from the tub for toilet purposes when necessary.\r\n\r\n 7. In preparing for the bath, warm the tubs with hot water and then\r\n    regulate the temperature so that a small amount of water at 96 degrees\r\n    will be flowing continually.\r\n\r\n 8. Adjust the hammock to the tub and place the patient in the bath\r\n    resting on the hammock. Adjust the cover to the tub, with patient's\r\n    head through the neck opening unless sheets or other covers are used.\r\n\r\n 9. The temperature of the water must be taken in each tub at least\r\n    every half hour. Feel the water in each tub frequently. If it seems\r\n    too warm or too cold, take the temperature at once. If you find it\r\n    varying from 96 degrees adjust to that temperature by adding a small\r\n    amount of hot or cold water. If the temperature cannot be kept between\r\n    95 and 97 degrees, let the water out of the tub and remove the patient\r\n    immediately. The physician in charge and the chief engineer should be\r\n    notified at once. The bath tub key must be fastened to a special cord\r\n    worn by the nurse on duty. It must be delivered to the nurse in charge\r\n    of the ward when the bathroom is closed.\r\n\r\n 10. If the patient is very noisy, restless or flushed, fasten an ice\r\n    poultice to the tub cover so that as the patient lies in the water the\r\n    back of the head or neck will rest upon it. Replace with a fresh one\r\n    before the ice is entirely melted.\r\n\r\n    Intensely excited patients may have cold compresses to the neck,\r\n    changed often, for periods of 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n    Sponge all faces with cold water once an hour.\r\n\r\n 11. Patients are to be permitted to drink as much cool water (not\r\n    iced) as they desire, and must be offered a drink at least once an\r\n    hour.\r\n\r\n 12. The nurse must record the following: 1. The water temperature and\r\n     the patient's pulse rate (temporal or facial) every half hour. 2. The\r\n     amount of sleep in the bath. 3. Bowel movements. 4. Nourishment. 5.\r\n     Medicine administered. 6. Hours of each patient in the tub. 7. The\r\n     name of each nurse and the exact time of going on or off duty.\r\n\r\n 13. In case the patient shows symptoms of fainting or convulsions,\r\n     makes any attempt at drowning, shows suicidal tendencies or becomes\r\n     too violent to remain in the tub with safety, let the water out and\r\n     remove the patient at once.\r\n\r\n 14. In the event of any serious accident or injury or sudden illness\r\n     the patient should be removed from the tub at once and the physician\r\n     notified.\r\n\r\n 15. Patients are not to be allowed to feed themselves but must always\r\n     be fed by the nurse. The inlets to the bath may be closed for twenty\r\n     minutes while patients are being fed.\r\n\r\n 16. During the day the warming closet must always contain one sheet\r\n     and one towel for each patient in preparation for drying. It must also\r\n     contain washable rugs for patients coming out of the tubs to step\r\n     upon; also two blankets for emergencies.\r\n\r\n     At least one hour before the patients are to be removed from the baths\r\n     the garments they are to wear after the bath must be placed in the\r\n     closet.\r\n\r\n 17. The temperature of the room should be kept as nearly as possible at\r\n     76 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature of the room cannot be kept\r\n     above 68 degrees discontinue the bathing.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the care and treatment of mental diseases was first undertaken in\r\nour state institutions it was soon found necessary to take advantage\r\nin every way of such material assistance as could be offered by the\r\nmore intelligent class of ablebodied patients in carrying on the\r\nroutine work of the hospital. There were never employees enough to\r\ndispense with their services. In this way it came about that they\r\nwere employed in the farms and gardens, assisted with the kitchen and\r\nhousework, shared the tasks of the nurses and attendants in the wards\r\nand were busily engaged in almost every department of the hospital\r\nactivities. It became apparent that occupation, undertaken originally\r\nfor purely economical purposes, constituted one of the most important\r\ntherapeutic agents at the disposal of the institution. The next step\r\nwas the development of industries. Patients were taught by instructors\r\nto make clothing, underwear, stockings, shoes, brooms, mats, brushes,\r\nmattresses, furniture and many other useful products needed by the\r\nhospital. The end products were in every instance utilitarian. These\r\naccomplishments led to a still further development—purely occupational\r\nin character. Women were encouraged to take up such activities as rug\r\nmaking of all varieties, basketry, weaving, crocheting, embroidery,\r\nand needlework of every description. Men usually make towelling on\r\nlooms, weave rugs, renovate mattresses, do repairing of all sorts and\r\nmanufacture small articles which interest the masculine mind. Brass\r\nwork, clay modelling and making jewelry of various kinds have been\r\nextensively employed.\r\n\r\nAll of these forms of employment mean, of course, that the patient\r\nmust leave the ward and go to some place designed for the purpose. The\r\nothers, however, have not been overlooked and occupational therapists,\r\nwho devote their entire time to stimulating the interest of the\r\npatients who cannot leave the wards, on account of their mental or\r\nphysical condition, in some absorbing and diverting occupation, are\r\nan important part of the personnel of every institution. No other\r\nform of treatment employed in hospitals for mental diseases has been\r\nso productive of results. It is interesting to note that the medical\r\nofficers of all of the forces engaged in the recent war found that\r\noccupational therapy was of great value in cases of shell shock and war\r\nneuroses.\r\n\r\nThe highest development perhaps of occupational therapy has been in\r\nits application to strictly reeducational work in dementia praecox.\r\nThis consists in a graduated and systematized reeducation of interests\r\nin apparently deteriorated individuals. The success of these efforts\r\ndepends largely on the fact that very simple lines are followed at\r\nfirst. The patients are interested in marching to music, simple drills,\r\ncalisthenics, games, basketball and purely physical exercises. Some\r\ncan be induced to sort out raffia and ultimately take part in basket\r\nmaking. Others cut out pictures or put puzzles together. The women\r\nsometimes are willing to do plain sewing or make paper flowers. They\r\nprogress by easy stages to more advanced and elaborate undertakings\r\nleading eventually to occupational work in the wards or possibly in\r\nthe industrial rooms. Some of the apparently most hopeless cases have,\r\nas a result of these reeducational efforts, been able to return to\r\ntheir homes greatly improved. The mental improvement goes hand in hand\r\nwith a resumption of their interests in their former work or some new\r\noccupational venture which may have proved attractive.\r\n\r\nEvery effort should be made to avoid the possibility of long hours\r\nof idleness in the wards. When not actively employed in occupational\r\nwork, ward games, reading, etc., the patients should be taken out\r\nof doors for fresh air and exercise. This, of course, suggests the\r\nnecessity and importance of attractive surroundings. Nothing can be\r\nmore depressive or detrimental to the welfare of the patient than a\r\nprisonlike appearance either inside of the buildings or on the grounds.\r\nThe successful operation of a hospital is dependent in no small measure\r\non the amount of attention devoted to the preparation of food. There\r\nmust be a general dietary for the active ablebodied class, one for the\r\nworking patients, an entirely different one for the tuberculous and\r\nepileptic cases and a special diet for the strictly hospital wards. In\r\nan institution of any size this requires the constant supervision of\r\nseveral dietitians.\r\n\r\nThe advances of recent years in our knowledge as to the etiology and\r\nnature of general paresis have led to the introduction of highly\r\nspecialized therapeutic methods in the treatment of that disease and of\r\ncerebro-spinal syphilis. This is an important feature of the work of\r\nour hospitals at the present time. The interest recently shown in the\r\nstudy of the endocrine system has already brought about a new line of\r\ntherapy which is destined to receive much attention in the future.\r\n\r\nEven the amusements necessary for the individual are given special\r\nattention in the treatment of mental diseases. This refers not only\r\nto methods of recreation and diversion in the wards day by day but\r\nincludes moving picture shows, dances and various other special\r\nentertainments. Not the least important consideration is the patient's\r\nbodily health. This is often a determining factor in bringing about a\r\nrestoration of mental integrity. It very often happens that there are\r\ndiseases of the eye, ear, nose, throat, skin, nervous system, etc.,\r\nwhich may require attention. Dental, surgical, gynecological and other\r\nspecial treatments sometimes prevent ordinarily acute and recoverable\r\npsychoses from terminating unfavorably.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the modern hospital treatment of mental diseases may be said\r\nto consist of a direct personal supervision of the mental and physical\r\nhygiene of the patient, supplemented by such specialized therapeutic\r\nprocedures as may be indicated in the individual case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PSYCHOPATHIC HOSPITAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has already been shown, the modern hospital treatment of mental\r\ndiseases in this country is a development which represents the\r\nprogress of nearly two centuries. Satisfactory as this has been\r\nin many respects, it nevertheless leaves much to be desired. All\r\nindications point to much greater accomplishments in the future. We are\r\nemerging from an era of custodial care and entering one of prevention,\r\nscientific investigation, and highly specialized treatment along\r\nentirely different lines. The interest of the public has been aroused\r\nin a subject which has heretofore been one to be avoided by common\r\nconsent. Mental hygiene societies are no longer viewed with suspicion\r\nand curiosity. We are approaching a time when mental diseases can\r\nbe dealt with, as other conditions are, without prejudice or unjust\r\ndiscrimination. Psychiatric wards promise to become integral parts of\r\na completed medical organization. Psychopathic hospitals will soon\r\nbe found in all of our great centers of population. The outlook for\r\nspecialized institutes for purely research purposes, unfortunately, is\r\nnot so encouraging at this time.\r\n\r\nAt last there is some evidence of progress in the teaching of\r\npsychiatry in medical schools, hospitals and clinics, although only\r\na beginning has been made as yet. More noteworthy advances have been\r\nmade in other countries. The appointment of Heinroth as a professor\r\nof psychiatry at Leipsic in 1811 promised developments which did\r\nnot materialize to any great extent for many years. According to\r\nSibbald,[33] psychiatric wards or clinics were established at Würzburg\r\nin 1833, Jena in 1848, Vienna in 1853, Berlin in 1865 and at Göttingen\r\nin 1866. Scholz made provision for observation wards in a general\r\nhospital in Bremen in 1875. Fürstner opened a psychiatric clinic at\r\nHeidelberg in 1878. Hitzig accomplished the same thing at Halle in 1891\r\nand Siemerling at Kiel in 1901. The inception of the modern psychiatric\r\nclinic has generally been attributed to Griesinger.[34] In his preface\r\nto volume one of the \"Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten\"\r\nin 1868 he advocated the establishment of small hospitals in cities\r\nfor the intensive treatment of acute and recoverable mental cases. He\r\nrecommended a large staff of physicians and accommodation for from\r\nsixty to eighty patients, according to the needs of the community, but\r\nnot to exceed one hundred and fifty under any circumstances. \"In close\r\nconnection with the organization of such institutions there is a crying\r\nneed and a new, most important interest—the question of psychiatrical\r\ninstruction. This is absolutely indispensable.\" This he proposed to\r\naccomplish by establishing a highly specialized clinic to be maintained\r\nlargely by the teaching staff of a university. Griesinger's ideas\r\nwere eventually carried out in full by Ziehen in Berlin, Sommer in\r\nGiessen and Bleuler in Zurich. Perhaps nothing has had more to do with\r\nthe development of psychopathic hospitals in the United States than\r\nthe well-known clinic established by Kraepelin at Munich in 1905. It\r\noccupies a three-story building accommodating one hundred patients and\r\ncares for between fifteen hundred and two thousand cases annually.\r\nHydrotherapeutic and electrical treatments are used extensively.\r\nA certain number of beds are reserved for research purposes.\r\nPsychological studies receive a great deal of attention. The\r\nout-patient department is a prominent feature. The teaching of\r\npsychiatry is one of the important purposes of the clinic. Kraepelin's\r\nmethods have been followed rather closely here. The remarks made by\r\nPliny Earle[35] in 1867 were almost prophetic in character. \"Carbon\r\nagglomerated is charcoal, carbon crystallized is diamond. What charcoal\r\nis to the diamond, such, I believe, is the psychopathic hospital of\r\nthe present compared with the psychopathic hospital of the future....\r\nWhen the defects which I have mentioned shall have been thoroughly\r\nremedied by a comprehensive curriculum, a complete organization, a\r\nperfect systematization, an efficient administration, the charcoal now\r\njust ready to begin the process of crystallization will have become the\r\ndiamond and the world will possess the psychopathic hospital of the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\nPsychiatric research was inaugurated in this country by the\r\nestablishment of the Pathological Institute of the New York State\r\nHospitals in New York City in 1896. Its original field of investigation\r\nwas limited to the laboratory. The name was changed to \"Psychiatric\r\nInstitute\" on the appointment of Dr. Adolf Meyer as director in 1902\r\nand the establishment was removed to Wards Island, where it was\r\nprovided with clinical facilities by the Manhattan State Hospital.\r\nIt thus became the precursor of the psychiatric clinic movement in\r\nAmerica. The observation wards for the examination and commitment of\r\nmental cases, at the Philadelphia Hospital (1890) and at Bellevue in\r\nNew York City were probably the first of the kind in this country. In\r\n1902 the first psychopathic wards connected with a general hospital\r\nwere opened by the Albany Hospital. Pavilion F, as it was designated,\r\nadmitted 3,132 patients during its first twelve and one-half years.\r\nThese included persons awaiting examination and commitment, voluntary\r\npatients and cases of delirium, stupor, etc., transferred from other\r\nwards of the hospital. Of 1,038 cases admitted during a period of six\r\nyears, only 17.6 per cent were committed to state hospitals. In a total\r\nof 1,855 cases, twenty-five per cent were found to be suffering from\r\nsome form of alcoholism and twenty-six per cent from chronic mental\r\nconditions, while thirty-five per cent were cases of the acute and\r\nrecoverable class. About fourteen per cent were psychoses associated\r\nwith renal conditions, neurasthenia, hysteria, tuberculosis or\r\ntraumatism.\r\n\r\nThe Psychopathic Hospital at the University of Michigan, the first\r\nof its kind on this continent, was established at Ann Arbor in 1906\r\nas a direct result of the activities of Dr. William J. Herdman. The\r\nobjects and purposes of the hospital were shown by the provision of\r\nthe legislature for the appointment of \"an experienced investigator in\r\nclinical psychiatry, who shall be placed in charge of the psychopathic\r\nward, whose duty it shall be to conduct the clinical and pathological\r\ninvestigations therein; to direct the treatment of such patients as\r\nare inmates of the psychopathic ward; to guide and direct the work\r\nof clinical and pathological research in the several asylums of\r\nthe state, and to instruct the students of the State University in\r\ndiseases of the mind.\" It was thus an integral part of the hospital\r\nof the University of Michigan but fully coordinated with the state\r\ninstitutions. A subsequent act of the legislature changed its status\r\nto that of a \"State hospital, specially equipped and administered for\r\nthe care, observation and treatment of insanity and for persons who\r\nare afflicted mentally but are not insane.\" It also provided that a\r\nclinical pathological laboratory should be maintained for the benefit\r\nof the state hospitals. During a period of eleven years it admitted\r\nan average of 168.82 patients per year. Twenty-four per cent of these\r\nwere voluntary cases. The psychoses represented were: manic-depressive\r\ninsanity, twenty-four per cent; dementia praecox, seventeen per\r\ncent; paranoid conditions, two per cent; hysteria, seven per cent;\r\npsychopathic personality, two per cent; alcoholic psychoses, four per\r\ncent; morphine intoxication, one per cent; imbecility, two per cent;\r\ngeneral paralysis, eight per cent; cerebral syphilis, one per cent;\r\nepilepsy, two per cent; senile psychoses, one per cent; cerebral\r\narteriosclerosis, three per cent; unclassified conditions, five per\r\ncent; and not insane, two per cent. Seventy-four per cent of all the\r\ncases admitted were discharged after a residence of three months or\r\nless and eighty-two per cent after a residence of four months or less.\r\nFourteen and eight-tenths per cent of all cases were discharged as\r\nrecovered and 32.7 per cent as improved. Owing to the fact that it\r\nhas only sixty-two beds at its disposal, the number of admissions is\r\nnecessarily limited and cases are carefully selected.\r\n\r\nThe Psychopathic Hospital in Boston, the first institution of the kind\r\nestablished in this country as a department of a state hospital (The\r\nPsychopathic Department of the Boston State Hospital), was opened for\r\nthe reception of patients in 1912. The purposes of the institution were\r\nvery clearly shown by the Twelfth Annual Report of the Massachusetts\r\nState Board of Insanity (1910):—\"The psychopathic hospital should\r\nreceive all classes of mental patients for first care, examination and\r\nobservation, and provide short, intensive treatment of incipient, acute\r\nand curable insanity. Its capacity should be small, not exceeding such\r\nrequirement. An adequate staff of physicians, investigators and trained\r\nworkers in every department should provide as high a standard of\r\nefficiency as that of the best general and special hospitals, or that\r\nin any field of medical science. Ample facilities should be available\r\nfor the treatment of mental and nervous conditions, the clinical study\r\nof patients on the wards, and scientific investigation in well-equipped\r\nlaboratories, with a view to prevention and cure of mental disease and\r\naddition to the knowledge of insanity and associated problems. Clinical\r\ninstruction should be given to medical students, the future family\r\nphysicians, who would thus be taught to recognize and treat mental\r\ndisease in its earliest stages, when curative measures avail most. Such\r\na hospital, therefore, should be accessible to medical schools, other\r\nhospitals, clinics and laboratories. It should be a center of education\r\nand training of physicians, nurses, investigators, and special workers\r\nin this and allied fields of work. Its out-patient department should\r\nafford free consultation to the poor, and such advice and medical\r\ntreatment as would, with the aid of district nursing, promote the home\r\ncare of mental patients. Its social workers should facilitate early\r\ndischarge and after care of patients, and investigate their previous\r\nhistory, habits, home and working conditions and environment, heredity\r\nand other causes of insanity, and endeavor to apply corrective and\r\npreventive measures.\"\r\n\r\nThe building has a capacity of one hundred and ten beds. The\r\ninstitution may be said to differ from other psychopathic hospitals\r\nin being an establishment essentially of the temporary care type,\r\nnot designed primarily either for the reception or for the care and\r\ncustody of obviously committable cases, but rather for the observation\r\nand treatment of incipient mental disorders as well as psychopathic\r\nconditions not properly coming within the scope of the state hospitals.\r\nIt has been as a rule the policy of the court to commit directly to\r\nother institutions for the insane all cases showing clearly the\r\nnecessity of an extended hospital residence. The fact that only forty\r\nper cent of the temporary care cases have been committed shows that a\r\npreliminary period of observation before these cases are definitely\r\ndisposed of is unquestionably warranted. The legal status of cases\r\nadmitted may be described as follows:—1. Temporary care (not to exceed\r\nten days); 2. Boston Police cases (Persons suffering from delirium,\r\nmania, mental confusion, delusions or hallucinations, or who come\r\nunder the care or protection of the police); 3. Observation cases (for\r\na period of thirty-five days, pending commitment); 4. Cases pending\r\nexamination and hearing; 5. Emergency commitments (not more than five\r\ndays); 6. Voluntary admissions; 7. Cases held under complaint or\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the work done by the Psychopathic Department from 1912\r\nto 1920 shows a total of 14,922 admissions to the wards,—an average of\r\n1,865 per year. Of these, 59.77 per cent were temporary care (10 day)\r\ncases, 18.56 per cent \"Boston Police\" cases, 1.38 per cent observation\r\ncases (thirty-five days), .50 per cent emergency cases, .61 per cent\r\ncommitted \"pending examination and hearing,\" 1.02 per cent under\r\ncomplaint or indictment and 16.96 per cent were voluntary cases. The\r\nentire temporary care group, including all of the above classes except\r\nthe voluntary and criminal cases, constituted 81.34 per cent of the\r\nadmissions. It is interesting to note that the principal psychoses\r\nrepresented by the cases coming into the hands of the Boston Police\r\nare dementia praecox, alcoholic psychoses and mental deficiency. The\r\nnumber of emergency cases is very small, as is the number committed by\r\ncourts for observation. The number of voluntary admissions, an average\r\nof 316 per year, constituting 16.96 per cent of the total, is very\r\nsignificant as showing the response to be expected from the public to\r\nan opportunity for hospital treatment without the formality of any\r\nlegal procedure. Of the 14,922 cases admitted between 1912 and 1920,\r\n38.45 per cent were subsequently committed as insane and 3,797, or\r\n25.44 per cent, were returned to the community as not requiring further\r\nhospital care or treatment.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the special field covered by the Boston\r\nPsychopathic Hospital consists of temporary care cases. The principal\r\npsychoses represented by 12,252 admissions of that class were as\r\nfollows: alcoholic psychoses, 9.25 per cent; dementia praecox, 25.0 per\r\ncent; senile psychoses, 3.16 per cent; general paresis, 6.06 per cent;\r\nmanic-depressive psychoses, 10.14 per cent; arteriosclerosis, 3.23 per\r\ncent; epilepsy, 1.85 per cent; and without psychoses, 20.63 per cent.\r\n\r\nThis latter class (without psychosis) is looked upon by some as\r\nconstituting the most important field of a psychopathic hospital. It\r\nis exceedingly interesting to note the conditions which bring such\r\nindividuals to the institution. An analysis of 1,430 cases shows\r\nthe principal mental types represented to be as follows:—mental\r\ndeficiency, thirty-four per cent; psychopathic personality, 15.17 per\r\ncent; hysteria, neurasthenia and other psychoneuroses, 11.2 per cent;\r\nepilepsy, 8.04 per cent; alcoholism, 6.08 per cent; conduct disorders,\r\n4.2 per cent; syphilis, 2.03 per cent; organic brain diseases, 1.68\r\nper cent; neurosyphilis, 1.26 per cent; drug addictions, 1.4 per cent;\r\nsomatic conditions, 1.19 per cent, etc.\r\n\r\nNo less interesting and instructive is a study of the voluntary cases.\r\nAn analysis of 1,807 admissions of this type shows the following\r\ndistribution of psychoses: alcoholic psychoses, 5.64 per cent; dementia\r\npraecox, 18.43 per cent; manic-depressive, 6.81 per cent; involution\r\nmelancholia, .99 per cent; senile psychoses, 1.11 per cent; general\r\nparesis, 7.9 per cent; epilepsy, 1.05 per cent; psychoneuroses, 3.59\r\nper cent; and without psychosis, 34.64 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe work of the out-patient service includes in a general way the study\r\nof cases referred to that department from the wards of the hospital or\r\nby its social service staff; cases referred by courts, schools, social\r\nagencies, and other institutions, as well as those sent by practicing\r\nphysicians and individuals coming on their own initiative. The response\r\non the part of the public to the facilities offered by the out-patient\r\ndepartment is shown by the fact that 9,273 new cases were reported\r\nduring a seven-year period, an average of 1,324.7 per year. Fifty-seven\r\nand six hundredths per cent of these cases were adults, 17.8 per cent\r\nwere classified as adolescents, 24.25 per cent as children and .89 per\r\ncent as infants. The source of origin of these cases is exceedingly\r\ninteresting. Four and eighty-seven hundredths per cent were referred\r\nto the out-patient service by courts; 4.65 per cent, by schools; 11.77\r\nper cent, by hospitals; 9.77 per cent, by physicians; and 3.55 per\r\ncent, by individuals. Fifteen and five tenths per cent came from the\r\nwards of the Psychopathic Hospital; 9.96 per cent, from the social\r\nservice department and 13.3 per cent came on their own initiative.\r\nThe question as to why these cases are sent to an institution of the\r\npsychopathic hospital type can now be answered. Fourteen and fifty-two\r\nhundredths per cent were examined solely for the purpose of determining\r\nthe existence of probable mental diseases and 21.88 per cent on account\r\nof suspected mental defects. Four and fifty-two hundredths per cent\r\nwere sex offenders. In 8.64 per cent the only question at issue was\r\nthe possibility of a psychoneurosis and in 7.97 per cent the purpose\r\nof the examination was to ascertain whether or not syphilis was\r\npresent. The diagnoses show the nature of the cases encountered in an\r\nout-patient mental clinic. Four and eighteen hundredths per cent were\r\ncases of dementia praecox; 1.7 per cent of alcoholism; 2.26 per cent\r\nof alcoholic psychoses; 2.39 per cent of epilepsy; 15.72 per cent of\r\nmental deficiency; 9.0 per cent of psychoneuroses; 2.14 per cent of\r\nmanic-depressive insanity; 2.09 per cent of psychopathic personality;\r\n1.21 per cent of general paresis; and 2.94 per cent were unclassified.\r\nTwo and thirty-two hundredths per cent were diagnosed as suffering\r\nfrom syphilis in some form and 6.27 per cent were either delinquent,\r\ndefective, subnormal, retarded or distinctly feebleminded. In 3.76 per\r\ncent no disease was found, either mental or physical. The great bulk of\r\nthese cases were diagnosed either as mental deficiency, psychopathic\r\npersonality or epilepsy. The ultimate disposition of 2,741 cases,\r\ncovering a period of two years, serves as an index of the practical\r\noperation of such a department. In 42.03 per cent of these cases no\r\ncare or observation other than that of the out-patient department was\r\nrequired. In 1.69 per cent of the cases commitment was recommended to\r\nhospitals for mental diseases, in 7.15 per cent, to schools for the\r\nfeebleminded and in .11 per cent, to penal institutions. General or\r\npsychopathic hospital care was recommended in 11.31 per cent. In 2.74\r\nper cent of the cases a report was made to courts; in 1.61 per cent, to\r\nschools; in 18.75 per cent, to social agencies; and in 1.13 per cent,\r\nto physicians.\r\n\r\nThe functions of the social service department in a general way may be\r\nsummarized as follows:—1. The after care and supervision of patients\r\nat home; 2. Advice to families of patients in regard to their cases;\r\n3. Advice given other members of the family; 4. Financial relief; 5.\r\nReference to other social agencies or institutions; 6. Information\r\nobtained for case histories; 7. Inquiries relative to home conditions\r\nwhen discharge of a patient is under consideration, etc. The routine\r\noperation of the department is well illustrated by the annual report\r\nof the Boston State Hospital for 1920. The number under social service\r\nsupervision during the year was 428. Of these, 278 were new cases.\r\nThirty-two and thirty-seven hundredths per cent were referred by the\r\nout-patient physicians; 59.71 per cent by the ward service; 7.19\r\nper cent by other social agencies; and .73 per cent were brought by\r\nrelatives or friends. The principal reasons for their reference to the\r\nsocial service workers were shown as follows:—For medical history,\r\n50.36 per cent; assistance in securing employment, 9.35 per cent;\r\nfinancial aid, 3.6 per cent; supervision, 7.2 per cent; advice, 19.42\r\nper cent; convalescent care, 2.87 per cent; home care, 2.87 per cent,\r\netc. An analysis of the cases under supervision shows the principal\r\npsychoses represented to be as follows:—Arteriosclerosis, 1.8 per\r\ncent; general paresis, 4.68 per cent; alcoholic psychoses, 1.8 per\r\ncent; manic-depressive psychoses, 4.68 per cent; dementia praecox,\r\n16.55 per cent; paranoid conditions, 4.31 per cent; psychoneuroses,\r\n9.35 per cent; undiagnosed psychoses, 6.84 per cent; and without\r\npsychoses, 44.24 per cent. This latter group was made up mostly of\r\npsychopathic personalities (28.45 per cent) and mental deficiency\r\n(26.29 per cent). The purely social problems presenting themselves\r\nin connection with these cases were reported as follows:—Mental\r\ndisease, 75.54 per cent; physical disease, 2.16 per cent; poverty,\r\n2.88 per cent; criminality, 3.24 per cent; juvenile delinquency, 2.52\r\nper cent; sex offenses, 2.16 per cent; alcoholism, 2.16 per cent;\r\nfamily dissension, 6.12 per cent; ignorance, 2.52 per cent; and bad\r\nenvironment, .36 per cent. In addition to this, 299 discharged soldiers\r\nand 543 out-patient cases were reported as being under the supervision\r\nof the department, as well as 532 special cases studied in connection\r\nwith the investigation of syphilis.\r\n\r\nThe Psychopathic Hospital in Boston started on a new chapter in its\r\nhistory on December 1, 1920, at which time it was formally separated\r\nfrom the Boston State Hospital and became a separate institution under\r\nthe direction of Dr. C. Macfie Campbell.\r\n\r\nThe Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in\r\nBaltimore was established in 1913. An integral part of a large\r\ngeneral hospital and intimately associated with a medical school, it\r\nconforms rather closely to the plan of the German psychiatric clinics.\r\nA study of its activities shows that during a period of five years\r\n(ending January 31, 1918) the admission rate averaged 403.8 per year.\r\nFourteen and three-tenths per cent of the cases were diagnosed as\r\ndementia praecox or schizophrenic reaction and 13.7 per cent conform\r\napparently to the classification of manic-depressive psychoses. Ten\r\nand five-tenths per cent were diagnosed as neuroses or psychoneuroses;\r\n6.1 per cent as general paresis; fifteen per cent as agitated\r\ndepressions; 2.3 per cent as alcoholic psychoses; and 6.1 per cent\r\nas constitutional inferiority or constitutional psychopathic states.\r\nSeven and nine-tenths per cent were cases of anxiety neuroses, agitated\r\ndepressions or anxiety psychoses; 2.3 per cent were paranoic states or\r\nreactions; 3.5 per cent were cases of alcoholism, and 3.7 per cent of\r\ndrug habits. The dispensary service of the Phipps Clinic has reported\r\nan average of 565 cases per year, representing a total of 2,260.5\r\nvisits annually.\r\n\r\nThe work of Drs. Meyer, Hoch and Kirby at the Psychiatric Institute,\r\nof Dr. Barrett at the Psychopathic Hospital at the University of\r\nMichigan, of Dr. Southard at the Psychopathic Department of the\r\nBoston State Hospital, and that of Drs. Meyer and Campbell at the\r\nPhipps Psychiatric Clinic in Baltimore has brought the subject of\r\npsychopathic hospitals very prominently before the public. Various\r\nother establishments of a similar nature have been planned and some\r\nare in process of construction, or already in operation. The State\r\nPsychopathic Institute at Chicago and the Psychopathic Hospital of the\r\nUniversity of Iowa should be mentioned in this connection. Psychopathic\r\nhospitals have been planned for New York City and one is to be built by\r\nthe State of California. The legislature of Colorado has already made\r\nan appropriation of $350,000 for the establishment of an institution of\r\nthis type in the city of Denver.\r\n\r\nThe work already done in this field shows quite conclusively that\r\ngeneral hospital methods are not inconsistent with the developments\r\nof modern psychiatric progress. The large percentage of voluntary\r\ncases received and the number of persons consulting the physicians in\r\nthe out-patient departments shows an unexpected demand on the part of\r\nthe public for institutions of a new type. As Dr. Adolf Meyer[36] has\r\npointed out, \"Our organized system for the care of mental disorder is\r\nin many respects forbidding. It throws together all kinds of diseases,\r\nand shocks in that way the already sensitive patient who fears the\r\nworst for himself or herself. It comes at once with an outspoken\r\ndeclaration of insanity in the very commitment to a hospital, an\r\nexpression which carries a humiliation to the patient and adds insult\r\nto injury. It often means carrying the patient off to a remote asylum\r\nwhich is too widely supposed to have the inscription, 'Leave hope\r\nbehind all ye that enter here.' Helpfulness rather than coercion\r\nmust take the place of all this.\" What the psychiatric clinic may be\r\nexpected to accomplish in remedying this difficulty was summarized by\r\nDr. Meyer[37] in the following words:—\"It is eminently necessary to\r\nget model institutions in which medical students and physicians can\r\nlearn how to deal with the many problems of the disorders of the organ\r\nof behaviour from their inceptions into all their ramifications. The\r\nclinic must do the work for at least one limited district, with its\r\nout-patient and social service and consultation department, and with\r\nits hospital wards. Everything must be done to make help in mental\r\ndisorders more acceptable and convincingly helpful. More patients must\r\nlearn to look to it for help and the organization must be so as to give\r\nthe patient and the physician and the public at large a conception very\r\ndifferent from that to-day associated with insanity. It is not so much\r\nthe issue of more help to the curable, but the issue of more work near\r\nwhere the troubles begin, and work against that which breeds trouble.\r\nFor this we must learn to put the chief weight on hospitals and\r\norganizations for natural districts for intensive work rather than upon\r\nthe mere economy of large hospitals far away from where the troubles\r\ndevelop.\"\r\n\r\nSouthard has raised the question as to the correct designation of\r\ninstitutions of the psychopathic hospital type:—\"A word is again\r\nnecessary as to the meaning of the term 'psychopathic hospital.'\r\nFor various reasons the term has become so attractive in propaganda\r\nthat a comparatively large number of institutions of whatever scope\r\nhave been founded or recommended to receive the term 'psychopathic\r\nhospital,' 'institute,' 'department' or 'ward.' Thus there is\r\ndeveloping a tendency in state hospitals to denominate the receiving\r\nward 'psychopathic.' There can be no advantage in this designation\r\nother than that of calling old ideas by new names. The idea of the\r\nreceiving ward for committed cases destined to receive the ordinary\r\nprobate court group of cases is not altered or improved in any manner\r\nby the designation 'psychopathic.' The best opinion seems to be that\r\na psychopathic hospital or institute shall be an institution in which\r\nall types of mental cases, from the probate court group on the one hand\r\nup to the most dubious and difficult cases of mental disorder on the\r\nother, may be examined; but if an institution is primarily or chiefly\r\nconcerned with patients of the medicolegal, committable or custodial\r\ngroup, to serve merely as a vestibule through which committed cases\r\npass, such an institution has by no means the broad scope which the\r\nvery general term 'psychopathic' implies. The institution is not a\r\nmodified or sublimated form of receiving ward for a great district\r\nhospital.\"\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, no reason why the reception service of an ordinary\r\nstate hospital should be spoken of as constituting a psychopathic ward.\r\nThis accomplishes nothing more, perhaps, than to raise some question\r\nas to what the functions of the rest of the institution may be. The\r\ndesignation psychopathic hospital has been rather loosely used and\r\nis, as Southard has definitely shown, of American origin. It has been\r\napplied somewhat indiscriminately from time to time to practically\r\nevery form of activity related to the care and treatment of mental\r\ndiseases outside of the generally recognized state hospital field.\r\nThese may be summarized as follows:—\r\n\r\n1. Detention wards, pavilions, etc. Intended for no purpose other than\r\nthe custody of the \"insane\" pending commitment.\r\n\r\n2. Psychiatric wards of general hospitals—such as Pavilion F in\r\nAlbany. There would appear to be no reason for the use of the word\r\npsychopathic in such cases, the term psychiatric being much more\r\nclearly applicable.\r\n\r\n3. Institutes designed primarily for research only or for research and\r\ninstruction, with or without clinical facilities.\r\n\r\n4. Psychopathic hospitals. Independent units or integral parts of\r\na general hospital—with or without facilities for research and\r\ninstruction. Designed exclusively for mental cases, without regard\r\nto legal status, whether committed or voluntary, their detailed\r\nexamination and careful observation with intensive treatment in the\r\nwards for limited periods when indicated, or their supervision and\r\ndirection in out-patient departments, serving also in some instances as\r\nreceiving and distributing centers supplying other institutions.\r\n\r\nOwing to their limited size, the necessity of treating large numbers in\r\na short space of time, and the fact that institutional care is already\r\namply provided for in the existing state hospitals, the obvious field\r\nof the psychopathic hospital is primarily the acute and recoverable\r\npsychoses and the milder forms of mental disorder which may or may\r\nnot require a residence in the wards. Only a thorough examination\r\nand a brief period of observation can determine whether or not that\r\nis needed. The question at issue is largely that of determining the\r\nnecessity of a more or less indefinite committed status. These problems\r\narise particularly in dealing with the so-called psychogenic disorders\r\nand the psychopathic states—hysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia,\r\nthe psychoneuroses in general and the episodes which characterize\r\nthe psychopathic personalities. Traumatic psychoses often come into\r\nconsideration, as well as cases of cerebrospinal syphilis, toxic\r\nconditions, drug addictions, the psychoses of infection and exhaustion,\r\nand above all, of course, manic-depressive insanity and incipient forms\r\nof dementia praecox. Many of these cases require only a brief hospital\r\ntreatment and are able in a short time to return to home surroundings\r\nand resume their former occupations. Often a contact with the chronic\r\nand custodial classes is not only without advantage but actually\r\ndetrimental. The psychopathic hospitals thus exercise a sort of\r\nclearing house function and return to the community many patients who\r\notherwise would be subjected to the stigma, if there is one, of a legal\r\ncommitment. While questions relating to the public health cannot be\r\nanalyzed in terms of dollars and cents, the saving to the state which\r\nis made by substituting a short period of supervision and treatment,\r\nfor a protracted residence in an institution of the custodial class\r\namounts to millions. In view of the difficulties encountered in\r\nobtaining adequate appropriations for the proper maintenance of the\r\nenormous population now housed in our state hospitals, this is a factor\r\nwhich cannot be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MENTAL HYGIENE MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the result of an intimate personal knowledge of the subject,\r\nacquired during an extended hospital residence as a patient in both\r\npublic and private institutions, Clifford W. Beers, having recovered\r\nhis health, resumed his place in the world profoundly impressed with\r\nthe feeling that the question of mental diseases as a public health\r\nproblem was one which demanded immediate consideration. In no position\r\nfinancially to institute a campaign for the purpose of interesting\r\nthe public in the importance of topics which had not been made the\r\nsubject of general discussion in the past, he was confronted with the\r\nnecessity of securing the cooperation and support of persons who had\r\nthe means to launch such an undertaking. With this object in view\r\nhe wrote his book—\"A Mind That Found Itself,\"[38] now in its fourth\r\nedition and destined, to use the words of the \"American Journal\r\nof Insanity,\"[39] \"to become one of the classics of psychological\r\nliterature.\" There is some question as to the accuracy with which Mr.\r\nBeers analyzed the experiences through which he had passed. Although\r\nthere is no reason for questioning his mental condition when the book\r\nwas written, his conclusions were apparently formulated when he had not\r\nas yet had sufficient time in which to readjust himself and recover\r\nhis perspective. Some of his viewpoints certainly reflect a morbid\r\ncoloring of which he was probably unconscious, although at the time\r\nhe recognized in himself \"symptoms hardly distinguishable from those\r\nwhich had obtained eight months earlier when it had been deemed\r\nexpedient temporarily to restrict my freedom.\" His work was referred\r\nto as an \"autopathography\" by Farrar,[40] who made a detailed study\r\nof the various psychological trends manifested. These are more or\r\nless immaterial. The interesting feature of his book is the elaborate\r\ndescription of a common but exceedingly important psychosis written\r\nby a well educated observer with a collegiate training. Its greatest\r\nvalue, however, lies in the fact that he brings home to us so\r\ngraphically the overwhelming importance of the personal element so\r\noften overlooked by those who are accustomed to dealing with mental\r\ncases in large numbers. \"It carries the reader away from the technical\r\ndissertations, and brings him face to face with the feelings and\r\nreactions of a distorted mind, showing him the patient as a human being\r\nwith a sentient soul and not as a case.\"[41]\r\n\r\nThat the plan which Mr. Beers had formulated for an organized mental\r\nhygiene movement had a practical application was recognized at once by\r\nDr. Adolf Meyer,[42] who expressed the following views on the subject\r\nas early as 1907:—\"It will be a difficult task to find the not very\r\ncommon level-headed and well-informed persons in various parts of the\r\ncountry capable of organizing the public conscience of the people.\r\nNeglected by physicians and dreaded by the fiscal authorities, the\r\nfacts are not available today, except in fragments, mixed up with\r\ninnumerable extraneous considerations; the hospitals are closed\r\ncorporations, the press injudicious in inquiry and reform, and those\r\ncapable of judgment unable to get the facts. The crying needs persist\r\nin the meantime. Instead of a land fund (the 12,225,000 acres bill\r\nand ideal of Dorothea Dix) we must have a permanent survey of the\r\nfacts and efficient handling of what is not prevented. The experience\r\nwith what remains as inevitable experiments of nature, as well as with\r\npeople who should know better, must be put into practical form for\r\ncommunication and teaching, and brought home where it will tell; in\r\nopportunities of work and education for physicians, and cooperation\r\nbetween our educational forces and those who labor for physical\r\nhygiene and prophylaxis. Most of us are already under too definite\r\nobligations to meet the call for devoted work for the maintenance of\r\nan organization as well as can Mr. Beers. In my judgment, he deserves\r\nthe assistance which will make it possible for others to join in the\r\nwork which will be one of the greatest achievements of this country\r\nand of this century,—less sensational than the breaking of chains but\r\nmore far-reaching and also more exacting in labor. A Society for Mental\r\nHygiene with a capable and devoted and judicious agent of organization\r\nwill put an end to the work of makeshift and short-sighted opportunism,\r\nand initiate work of prevention and of helping the existing hospitals\r\nto attain what they should attain, and further of adding those\r\nlinks which are needed to put an end to conditions almost unfit for\r\npublication. What officialism will never do alone must be helped along\r\nby an organized body of persons who have set their hearts on serious\r\ndevotion to the cause. If Mr. Beers gets the means to pursue his aim he\r\nwill secure the body which will guarantee proper judgment in a cause\r\nwhich has been a mere foster-child in the field of charitable donations\r\nmerely because it seemed too difficult. Here is a man who is not afraid\r\nof the task. May he get the help to enable him to surround himself with\r\nthe best wisdom of our nation!\"\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this and many other such expressions of opinion, Mr.\r\nBeers proceeded to the organization of the first state mental hygiene\r\nsociety, that of Connecticut, which began its activities in 1908.\r\nThe National Committee for Mental Hygiene was formally organized on\r\nFebruary 19, 1909. The first few years were devoted to raising funds\r\nand making comprehensive preparations for further activities which\r\ndid not start until 1912. In the meanwhile the cooperation of many\r\nprominent philanthropists, educators, physicians, etc., was assured.\r\nThe importance of this movement is illustrated by the prominence of the\r\npersons who were willing to associate themselves with an undertaking of\r\nthis nature. The membership of the committee has included, in addition\r\nto many others, Professor William James, Dr. Lewellys F. Barker,\r\nDr. Rupert Blue, Dr. George Blumer, Dr. G. Alder Blumer, Professor\r\nRussell H. Chittenden, Ex-President Charles W. Eliot, President W.\r\nH. P. Faunce, President John H. Finley, Professor Irving Fisher, Dr.\r\nCharles H. Frazier, Cardinal Gibbons, President Arthur T. Hadley,\r\nChancellor David Starr Jordan, President Cyrus Northrop, Dr. Stewart\r\nPaton, Dr. Frederick Peterson, Professor Gifford Pinchot, President\r\nJacob G. Sherman, Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt,\r\nProfessor Henry VanDyke, Dr. William H. Welch and Ex-President Benjamin\r\nIde Wheeler. Important financial contributions were made by Professor\r\nWilliam James, Mr. Jacob A. Riis, Mr. Henry Phipps, Mrs. Elizabeth M.\r\nAnderson, Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt, Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Mrs. Willard\r\nStraight, the Rockefeller Foundation, etc. With the appointment of Dr.\r\nThomas W. Salmon as Medical Director in 1912 the committee commenced\r\nactive operations with its future success assured in every way.\r\n\r\nThe objects and purposes of the National Committee have been very\r\nadequately summarized in the following language used in one of its\r\npublications:—\"The National Committee for Mental Hygiene and its\r\naffiliated state societies and committees are organized to work\r\nfor the conservation of mental health; to help prevent nervous and\r\nmental disorders and mental defect; to help raise the standards of\r\ncare and treatment for those suffering from any of these disorders\r\nor mental defect; to secure and disseminate reliable information\r\non these subjects and also on mental factors involved in problems\r\nrelated to industry, education, delinquency, dependency, and the like;\r\nto aid ex-service men disabled in the war; to cooperate with the\r\nfederal, state, and local agencies and with officials and with public\r\nand private agencies whose work is in any way related to that of a\r\nsociety or committee for mental hygiene. Though methods vary, these\r\norganizations seek to accomplish their purposes by means of education,\r\nencouraging psychiatric social service, conducting surveys, promoting\r\nlegislation, and through cooperation with the many agencies whose work\r\ntouches at one point or another the field of mental hygiene. When one\r\nconsiders the large groups of people who may be benefited by organized\r\nwork in mental hygiene, the importance of the movement at once becomes\r\napparent. Such work is not only for the mentally disordered and those\r\nsuffering from mental defect, but for all those who, through mental\r\ncauses, are unable so to adjust themselves to their environment as to\r\nlive happy and efficient lives.\" The first few years of the committee's\r\nexistence have demonstrated conclusively that it is the most powerful\r\nfactor in promoting the welfare and interests of the insane in this\r\ncountry since the time of Dorothea Dix. The elaborate surveys which\r\nit has made of conditions existing in various states have resulted in\r\nbeneficial legislation which had been needed for years. Surveys have\r\nbeen completed in California, Tennessee, Louisiana, Pennsylvania,\r\nTexas, Connecticut, Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina, and\r\nothers are under way. It has brought about an interest in mental\r\ndiseases and mental defects such as has never been manifested before\r\nin this country. Its activities during the early part of the war\r\nwere responsible largely, if not entirely, for the attention given\r\nby the Army and Navy to matters relating to psychiatry. The National\r\nCommittee has taken a very active part in encouraging the establishment\r\nof psychiatric clinics in connection with the state hospitals. It\r\nhas been largely responsible for the psychological and psychiatric\r\nexamination of defectives in penal institutions and reformatories now\r\ngenerally recognized as being of vital importance. Its activities\r\nhave emphasized the importance of a preliminary mental examination of\r\nobviously defective individuals brought before the courts. One of its\r\naccomplishments has been the publication of a very successful quarterly\r\nmagazine, \"Mental Hygiene,\" which was undertaken in 1917 and has long\r\nsince passed the experimental stage. A summary of its activities would\r\nnot be complete without a reference to the valuable work which the\r\ncommittee has done in standardizing the reports made of institutions\r\nand compiling accurate statistics relating to mental diseases and\r\ndefects which will be of inestimable value to all who are interested in\r\nthe progress of psychiatry in this country.\r\n\r\nState mental hygiene societies now exist in Alabama, California,\r\nConnecticut, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nIowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Maine, Mississippi,\r\nMissouri, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee\r\nand Virginia. The committee on mental hygiene in New York is a\r\ndepartment of the State Charities Aid Association, which has been\r\nactively interested in matters relating to the care and treatment\r\nof the insane for many years. The chief purposes of the state\r\norganizations have been officially described as follows:—[43] \"To work\r\nfor the conservation of mental health; for the prevention of mental\r\ndiseases and mental deficiency and for improvement in the care and\r\ntreatment of those suffering from nervous or mental diseases or mental\r\ndeficiency.\" The interest of the public is stimulated by pamphlets,\r\nreports and publications of various kinds, mental hygiene exhibits of\r\nan educational nature, public lectures, mental hygiene conferences,\r\netc. The local societies have as a definite object, moreover, the\r\nencouragement of[44] \"(a) Out-patient departments for mental cases in\r\nconnection with hospitals for mental diseases and general hospitals,\r\nand independent of either of these agencies, such, for instance, as\r\ndispensaries and mental hygiene clinics, (b) Systematic psychiatric as\r\nwell as psychological examination of school children, (e) Provision\r\nfor incipient and emergency cases in psychopathic wards of general\r\nhospitals, (d) Psychopathic hospitals in which cases of mental disorder\r\nmay be treated in their earliest and most curable stages and where\r\npractical work in prevention and social service may be done, (e)\r\nIncreased institutional provision for the feebleminded and epileptic.\"\r\nOne of their most important objects is the enactment of laws in the\r\nvarious states which will take care of the insane pending commitment\r\nout of the hands of the poor authorities and delegate it to health\r\nofficers or physicians. As Dr. William L. Russell[45] has pointed out,\r\nthe mere provision of institutional care for the mental diseases of a\r\ncommunity is not the only thing to be considered, \"Unless the vital\r\nissues occasioned by mental disorders in the homes, the schools, the\r\nindustries, and in social relations are intelligently grasped and dealt\r\nwith by means of the state system, state institutions are liable to be\r\nlooked upon as a resource which is only to be appealed to when complete\r\nseparation of the patient from his usual environment has become\r\nimperative. They will still be regarded as asylums. In such case,\r\ntheir development is likely to be in the direction of great custodial\r\ncenters, and economic and so-called business consideration in their\r\nmanagement are likely to prevail over those dictated by science and\r\nhumanity. This has happened in more than one state in which state care\r\nhas been adopted under conditions of great promise. A system of state\r\ncare must, to be effective, not only be adopted, but it must be planned\r\nand developed with reference to the known needs of the sufferers from\r\nmental disorder.\"\r\n\r\nThe Canadian National Committee for Mental Hygiene, the second national\r\norganization of this type, was established at Ottawa on April 26, 1918,\r\nlargely as a result of the activities of Dr. Clarence M. Hincks of\r\nToronto University. Arrangements were at once effected for an active\r\nparticipation in war work, a comprehensive study of immigration,\r\nelaborate statistical institutional studies, the establishment of a\r\nlibrary, special investigation of delinquency and a series of lectures\r\nto be given in various parts of the Dominion. This organization has\r\nbeen an exceedingly active one from the beginning. The first number\r\nof the \"Canadian Journal of Mental Hygiene\" appeared early in 1919. A\r\nsurvey was made of Manitoba and its needs during the first year. The\r\nUniversity of Toronto announced an extension course beginning April,\r\n1919, for the special training of social workers desiring to enter\r\nthe mental hygiene field. Instruction was given in psychiatry, social\r\nand economic problems, neurology, mental tests, case work, social\r\ninstitutions, occupational therapy, child welfare, home economics\r\nand recreation. In 1919 a mental hygiene survey was made of British\r\nColumbia. Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have already requested\r\nsimilar surveys with the intention of improving the methods of caring\r\nfor mental diseases and defects in those provinces. Psychiatric clinics\r\nhave been established in connection with the Toronto University and\r\nthe Royal Victoria Hospital in Quebec. New institutions have been\r\nplanned in British Columbia and a psychopathic hospital is to be built\r\nin Toronto. In 1920 a mental hygiene committee was instituted in\r\nFrance[46] by the Minister of Hygiene, Assistance and Social Providence.\r\nThe committee is made up of about forty members, psychiatrists,\r\npathologists, physiologists, managers and magistrates. Dr. Dron,\r\nSenator and Mayor of Tourcoing, was elected chairman. The committee\r\nis to make a study of all questions relating to mental hygiene and\r\npsychiatry. It will consider particularly methods of coordinating the\r\nactivities of various organizations already at work, the creation of\r\nnew interests and spreading broadcast information on mental hygiene\r\ntopics. A representative of this society has already made a visit\r\nto this country to study methods employed here. The mental hygiene\r\nmovement has even reached South Africa. \"Mental Hygiene\"[47] has called\r\nattention to the fact that the Cape Province Society for Mental Hygiene\r\nhas actively interested itself in the provisions discussed by the\r\ngovernment for the care, education and training of the feebleminded.\r\nTwo institutions are to be opened for this purpose. The Cape Province\r\nSociety has already instituted a campaign for the purpose of organizing\r\nother local societies as well as a national council.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Beers wrote his well-known book he evidently had in mind\r\nmore particularly the amelioration of material conditions existing\r\nin institutions. He was looking forward to provision for the more\r\nhumane and scientific care of mental diseases. This is unquestionably\r\na consideration of vital importance and these objects have not\r\nbeen neglected in the practical operation of the mental hygiene\r\norganizations. Mental hygiene in its broadest sense, however, has\r\ncome to mean much more than that. The foundation of the present-day\r\nconception of mental hygiene may be said to have been laid by Adolf\r\nMeyer in 1906, when he described the fundamental principles which he\r\nbelieved to be concerned in the development of dementia praecox. He saw\r\nin this disease a disorder of the personality due to a deterioration\r\nof mental habits, in other words, to faulty mental hygiene. While his\r\nviews as to the etiology of dementia praecox have not been generally\r\naccepted, they suggested an entirely new avenue of approach to the\r\nproblem of mental diseases in general. Hoch's \"shut in\" personality\r\nand Bleuler's \"autismus\" were more or less comparable hypotheses\r\nwhich do warrant to a certain extent the tenability of such theories\r\nas were advanced by Meyer. The same may be said of some of the\r\nmental mechanisms advocated by Freud and others of the more purely\r\npsychological school of psychiatrists. This viewpoint is reflected\r\nsomewhat by White[48] in his conception of childhood as the golden\r\nperiod for mental hygiene. \"The outstanding fact that present-day\r\npsychiatry emphasizes is that mental illness is a type of reaction of\r\nthe individual to his problems of adjustment which is conditioned by\r\ntwo factors—the nature of those problems and the character equipment\r\nwith which they are met.... Mental illnesses, defects of adjustment at\r\nthe psychological level, are therefore dependent upon defects in the\r\npersonality make-up, and as this personality make-up is what it is as\r\na result of its development from infancy onward, it follows that the\r\nfoundation of those defects which later issue in mental illness are to\r\nbe found in the past history of that development.\" He protests very\r\nproperly against accepting the theory that the characteristics of the\r\npersonality are entirely the products of germ-plasm determiners moulded\r\nin strict accordance with the laws of heredity and therefore immutable.\r\n\r\nCopp[49] has called attention to the fact that the dominant figure in\r\nmental hygiene activities must eventually be the family physician,\r\nwho has an opportunity to see the beginnings of mental disorders when\r\nthey first manifest themselves. He must, therefore, be qualified to\r\nintelligently understand such conditions and be prepared to suggest a\r\nremedy. His is inevitably the first point of contact. Mental hygienists\r\nhave found a fertile and almost untouched field in our public school\r\nsystem. As Professor Burnham[50] suggests, \"It is a grave reflection\r\nupon the schools that so many of their graduates have to be reeducated\r\nin the sanitarium or the hospital.\" The hygiene movement in the school\r\npopulation, as suggested by Professor Gesell,[51] means something more\r\nthan psychological examinations and mental tests, important as they\r\nare. It means a study of the individual. He would have a new type of\r\nschool nurse or social worker, one interested particularly in \"the\r\nchild with the night terrors, the nail biter, the over-tearful child,\r\nthe over-silent child, the stammering child, the extremely indifferent\r\nchild, the pervert, the infantile child, the unstable choreic, and a\r\nwhole host of suffering, frustrated and unhealthily constituted growing\r\nminds, that we are barely aware of in a quantitative sense, because we\r\ndo not have the agencies to bring them to our attention as problems\r\nof public hygiene and prophylaxis.\" They require highly specialized\r\nsupervision and training if they are not to become future residents\r\nof our hospitals for mental diseases or possibly of institutions of a\r\nreformatory type. If such reforms as these are to be brought about in\r\nour public school system it is hardly necessary to suggest that the\r\nteacher herself must have very clear conceptions as to the significance\r\nand importance of mental training in youth.\r\n\r\nIf these matters are important in the public schools they must be even\r\nmore serious factors in higher education. Campbell[52] has raised the\r\nquestion as to how far the universities \"fulfill their responsibilities\r\nwith regard to the mental hygiene of the community? It is doubtful\r\nwhether they have attained a clear recognition of the fact that a\r\nman's mind may be richly supplied with a great variety of special\r\ninformation, that he may have attained a high intellectual level, and\r\nyet the man's life may be rendered inefficient because it rests upon\r\ninsecure foundations. An education may enable a man to solve abstruse\r\nintellectual problems, and yet leave him so hopelessly unable to cope\r\nwith a bereavement, an unsuccessful love affair, difficult marriage\r\nrelations, or even simple instructive impulses that he may lose\r\ncontrol of the direction of his life and for a period be dominated by\r\nfactors which have been almost entirely repressed in his conscious\r\nlife; the disorder may be so marked as to be included under the wide\r\nterm \"insanity.\" To rear a superb intellectual structure on such a\r\nfoundation is surely not an ideal education; it is like building\r\na house on the sand, or, to speak more hygienically, it is like\r\nbuilding a superb mansion without paying any attention to the\r\nplumbing.\" Deplorable as it may seem that such important elements in\r\nthe education of the individual have been overlooked, it is not nearly\r\nso surprising as the fact that no instruction of any consequence is\r\ngiven in psychiatry in the great majority of our medical schools.\r\nThis is a matter which is well worthy of attention and is fortunately\r\nbeginning to receive some consideration. A rather systematic campaign\r\nhas been instituted by the mental hygiene organizations to bring about\r\nsome instruction in these topics in our schools and universities,—a\r\ncampaign which promises to be productive of results sooner or later.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of the mental hygiene movement is the relation\r\nwhich it has been shown to hold to the field of industry. It must be\r\nadmitted that this is an intensely practical question. We even have a\r\nJournal of Industrial Hygiene, which has been published successfully\r\nnow for some time. The mere taking of intelligence tests for industrial\r\npurposes is only an incident. The important thing, as shown by\r\nCobb,[53] is the prevention of mental disorder by bringing about a\r\nproper relation of the worker to his environment and the elimination\r\nof causes of discontent. Beyond this there is, of course, the early\r\ntreatment of individuals before the opportunity of bringing about a\r\nproper adjustment has been lost for all time. Cobb[54] suggests that,\r\nabove all, the physician must \"forget orthodox psychiatry (as the\r\neconomist seems to be forgetting cut-and-dried political economy) and\r\ninterest himself in a dynamic, individual psychology which recognizes\r\nthe essentials of human nature and at last begins to analyze for us\r\nthe elements of which human nature really consists, looking on each\r\ncase as a human experiment in reaction to environment.\"\r\n\r\nThere would appear to be no limit to the possibilities of the mental\r\nhygiene movement. Perhaps no more comprehensive summary of its objects\r\nand purposes can be given at this time than that contained in a\r\ndefinition recently formulated by Southard:[55] \"To stem the tide\r\nof syphilis, to wage war on alcohol, to counsel against marriage of\r\ndefectives, to generalize the insane hospitals, to specialize the\r\ngeneral hospitals, to weed defects out of general school classes,\r\nto open out the shut-in personality, to ventilate sex questions, to\r\nperturb and at the same time reassure the interested public—these\r\nare infinitives that belong perhaps in a rational movement for mental\r\nhygiene. They are things the past has taught us more or less clearly to\r\ndo and in that sense the movement for mental hygiene is surely not much\r\nmore than the elaboration of the obvious.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be suggested that these are functions which properly belong to\r\nthe medical profession exclusively. A little reflection will, however,\r\nbe sufficient to show that this is not the case. Efforts have been\r\nmade for years to prevent the spread of venereal disease. Attempts\r\nwere made to accomplish this by legislative enactment. That these\r\nmethods of control have been ineffectual is now well known to everyone.\r\nContinental governments have for a long while been trying to regulate\r\nprostitution by police supervision and frequent medical inspections.\r\nThe percentage of venereal disease has, however, not been appreciably\r\nreduced by this plan and it has been repeatedly condemned by vice\r\ncommissions as a result of official investigations. It may be stated\r\nnow, I think, without fear of contradiction that this is a matter\r\nwhich must be regulated by educating the public and which can be\r\nhandled in no other way. It is a well known fact that no law can\r\nbe enforced unless it meets with public approval. The will of the\r\nmajority rules. When the effects of venereal disease are generally\r\nrecognized there will no longer be a necessity for much legislation on\r\nthe subject. This is a question of far-reaching importance. When it is\r\nrecalled that twelve per cent of the cases admitted to our hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases are suffering from general paresis or cerebral\r\nsyphilis, the necessity of a more general understanding of these\r\nconditions is readily apparent. The percentage is much higher in the\r\ndensely populated metropolitan districts.\r\n\r\nLegislative restrictions in the past were never very successful\r\nin limiting the use of alcoholic beverages. It is true that the\r\nEighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the\r\nVolstead Act have had a very material effect on the number of cases of\r\nalcoholism admitted to our institutions. The influences which resulted\r\nin alcoholism, however, will find an outlet in some other direction\r\nunless they are modified in some way. This again is largely a matter of\r\neducation. There never was a time in the history of the country when a\r\nknowledge of the effect of drugs of various kinds on the nervous system\r\nwas as important as it is today.\r\n\r\nThe history of the movement to prevent the marriage of mental\r\ndefectives is more or less familiar to all. The sentiment of the\r\ncommunity is apparently not such at this time as to encourage the\r\nregulation of the marriage of the mentally or physically unfit by\r\nlegislative restrictions. Attempts to do so have been almost a\r\nflat failure. Various states have passed laws providing for the\r\nsterilization of defective delinquents. These laws, generally speaking,\r\nhave accomplished nothing because public sentiment was not behind\r\nthem. All of these matters have been brought to the attention of the\r\npublic by prominent speakers on numerous occasions. Frequent articles\r\nhave been printed in medical journals, well-known periodicals, and even\r\nin the daily papers. Attention has been called to the mental clinics\r\nestablished here and there and repeated reference has been made to the\r\nfact that physicians at our state hospitals may be consulted at any\r\ntime on questions pertaining to mental diseases or mental defects.\r\n\r\nSomething has been accomplished along these lines. It is unfortunate\r\nthat, as a rule, people look with more or less suspicion upon\r\ninstitutions which are even now generally referred to as asylums. There\r\nare many who still believe that every hospital for mental diseases\r\nhas its padded cells and underground dungeons. There is a rather\r\nwidespread idea that the most common causes of insanity are cigarette\r\nsmoking, religion and self abuse. Even in our most progressive\r\ncommunities it has been difficult, if not impossible, to entirely\r\nprevent the temporary detention, at least, of mental cases in jails\r\nand police stations. Very few general hospitals have psychopathic\r\nwards or any realization as to the necessity of establishing them.\r\nIt is not to be denied that in many states the care of the mentally\r\nill in our public institutions is far from being what it should be in\r\nthis enlightened day. These are conditions that cannot be remedied by\r\nthe medical profession without the active assistance of leaders of\r\npublic sentiment. The fact that the importance of these questions is\r\nrecognized by prominent educators, business men, lawyers, and other\r\npersons active in the affairs of the community, and well known to the\r\npublic, will accomplish more than articles in the medical journals by\r\nphysicians. This constitutes the great field of the mental hygiene\r\norganizations. They will mould public sentiment as nothing else ever\r\nhas, in matters which relate to the mental health of the country. They\r\nwill influence legislation where it is needed in a way that no medical\r\nsociety can hope to do. Above all, they can in time bring the public\r\nface to face with the fact that mental diseases should be discussed,\r\ngenerally understood and prevented, instead of being merely concealed\r\nand misrepresented. Possibly it would not be looking too far into the\r\nfuture to express the hope that an organization composed largely of\r\nlaymen may be able eventually to accomplish something that the medical\r\nprofession has never been able to do,—induce those who frame our laws\r\nto provide medical treatment for defective delinquents instead of\r\nmerely locking them up for the protection of society. It would seem,\r\nmoreover, that the time has come when the public should insist that the\r\nmental condition of persons accused of crime be made a medical rather\r\nthan a legal question exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE ETIOLOGY OF MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of medicine there is nothing more discouraging\r\nthan the references found in literature to the views entertained\r\nfrom time to time relative to the cause of mental diseases. To a\r\ncertain extent this may be looked upon as an index of the progress\r\nof civilization. It must be admitted that it is at the same time,\r\nnevertheless, a reflection upon the medical profession which has never\r\nshown the interest in psychiatry that the importance of the subject\r\nwarrants. It has been suggested that mental diseases did not play a\r\nprominent part in ancient history, owing to the fact that the law of\r\nthe survival of the fittest automatically eliminated the insane and\r\ndefective. As Tuke[56] says, \"They perished in the course of nature, or\r\nwere stamped out of existence; many of the perverse and morally insane\r\nwere stoned to death; war destroyed a large number of feeble persons;\r\nwhile the Romans deliberately, and in the interests of the race, threw\r\ndown from the Tarpeian Rock the children who were unfit to live.\" The\r\npapyri of the fifteenth century before Christ show clearly that the\r\ndoctrine of demoniacal possession was generally entertained at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest attempts to explain the origin of mental diseases\r\nperhaps was that of Plato. \"There are two kinds of madness, one\r\narising from human diseases, the other from an inspired deviation from\r\nestablished custom.\" Hippocrates[56] had some very clearly defined\r\nviews on this subject: \"As long as the brain is at rest a man enjoys\r\nhis reason; but the depravement of the brain arises from phlegm and\r\nbile, either of which you may recognise in this manner: Those who are\r\nmad from phlegm are quiet, and do not cry out or make a noise, but\r\nthose from bile are vociferous, malignant, and will not be quiet, but\r\nare always doing something improper. If the madness be constant, these\r\nare the causes thereof; but if terrors and fears assail, they are\r\nconnected with derangement of the brain, and derangement is owing to\r\nits being heated. And it is heated by bile when it is determined to\r\nthe brain along the blood-vessels running from the trunk, and fear is\r\npresent until it return again to the veins and trunk, when it ceases.\r\nHe is grieved and troubled when the brain is unreasonably cooled and\r\ncontracted beyond its wont. It suffers this from phlegm, and from\r\nthe same affection the patient becomes oblivious.\" An interesting\r\ntheory which he evolved was that the appearance of varicose veins\r\nor hemorrhoids tended to relieve the patient's mental suffering.\r\nCelsus subscribed to the black bile doctrine. Galen's teaching was\r\nthat fatuity was due to moisture, while dryness produced sagacity. In\r\ncases where the whole body contained melancholy blood he recommended\r\nvenesection. Thick and black wine was to be avoided, \"as from it the\r\nmelancholy humour is made.\"[57] This he described as a condition of\r\nthe blood \"thickened, and more like black bile, which exhaling to the\r\nbrain, causes melancholy symptoms to affect the mind.\" The Roman custom\r\nof appealing to the household gods, sons of the Goddess of Madness,\r\nwas quite significant. Horace, in speaking of Orestes, says: \"Was he\r\nnot driven into frenzy by those wicked Furies, before he pierced his\r\nmother's throat with the reeking point of his sword? Nay, from the time\r\nthat Orestes passed for being unsound of mind he did nothing in any\r\nway to be condemned; he never dared wound with his sword either his\r\nfriend Pylades or his sister Electra; he merely abused both, calling\r\none a Fury, the other some other name suggested by his active or bright\r\nbile.\" In the story of Argive, Horace says that \"his relations cured\r\nhim with much labour and care, by expelling the disease and the bile by\r\ndoses of pure hellebore.\"\r\n\r\nLittle progress was made, if any, by the time of the Christian era. In\r\nfact, as Clouston[58] says, \"The mental pathology of the New Testament\r\nand of the early ages of Christianity was founded on the idea that the\r\ndisease was a possession of the devil, and the feeling towards this\r\nafflicted class of human beings was naturally that of repulsion and\r\nhatred, their treatment following on those lines. Neglect, the whip,\r\nchains, confinement in stone cells, starvation, unsuitable medical\r\ntreatment, speedy death were the natural results.\"\r\n\r\nPassing to the seventeenth century we find that Sennert, a professor\r\nin Wittenberg, believed that maniacs evacuated stones, iron, living\r\nanimals, etc., things not produced in the natural body and therefore\r\ncaused by demons. He also believed firmly in witchcraft. Thomas Willis\r\n(1682) is said by some to have been one of the first to suggest a\r\nrelation between insanity and pathological changes in the brain.\r\nProchaska in 1784 went so far as to say, \"We think, with Haller, that\r\nno light can be thrown upon it in any other way than by a careful\r\ndissection of the brains of fatuous persons, apoplectics, and such as\r\nhave other disorders of the understanding.\" It would appear to have\r\nbeen the belief of Pinel that the primary seat of disease in mental\r\nconditions was in the stomach and intestinal tract. Spreading from\r\nthese centers it caused a derangement of the mind when the brain became\r\ninvolved. The influence of the moon, as well as the stars, was spoken\r\nof by Hippocrates and admitted by Galen. To these ideas we owe the\r\nword lunacy which appeared in the laws of England in 1320 and may be\r\nfound there today.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the moon on the mind was taken quite seriously. Rush\r\nseems to have been somewhat in doubt on this subject and suggested the\r\nprobability of there being a kind of sixth sense involved—a perception\r\nof the state of the air, and of light and darkness, as Pritchard\r\nexpressed it, to which we are insensible in health. It was thought that\r\nthe full moon, by rarefying the air, increased the amount of light,\r\nthus affecting the mind. Dr. Rush noted that during an eclipse of the\r\nsun in 1806 \"there was a sudden and total silence in all the cells of\r\nthe hospital.\" He expressed the opinion in his \"Medical Inquiries and\r\nObservations\" in 1812 that there are few cases in which the insane feel\r\nthe influence of the moon and that the excitement resulting in such\r\ncases is to be attributed to the resulting increase of light. It is\r\ninteresting to note that von Feuchtersleben, an eminent German writer,\r\nin 1845 was unwilling to go on record as stating positively that the\r\nmoon was not a factor in the causation of insanity. Esquirol, in his\r\n\"Maladies Mentales,\" in 1838, branded this belief as a superstition,\r\nbut admitted that there were certain facts which could not be\r\noverlooked. \"It is true that the insane are more agitated at the full\r\nmoon as they are also at the dawn of day; but is it not the bright\r\nlight of the moon that excites them, as that of the day every morning?\r\nNevertheless, an opinion which has existed for ages—which has spread\r\nover all lands, and which is consecrated by popular language—demands\r\nthe most careful attention of observers.\" Dr. Allen of the York Lunatic\r\nAsylum was very firmly of the opinion that the moon had a decided\r\ninfluence on the time of death in mental diseases. This question was\r\ngiven very serious consideration by various writers as late as 1856.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile efforts were being made to ascertain the cause of\r\nmental disease by means of pathological researches. Morgagni,[59] one of\r\nthe earlier investigators, came to the conclusion that the more common\r\nlesions were in the pineal gland, although he found some induration\r\nof the brain and various other well-defined changes. Arnold (1782)\r\nthought that insanity was due to an increased density of the cerebral\r\nsubstance, particularly, according to Tuke, \"of those parts of the\r\nbrain by means of which the soul is connected with the body.\" Pinel\r\nfinally concluded that pathology had practically nothing to do with the\r\nproblem and Esquirol in 1838 wrote very discouragingly on the subject.\r\nEarly contributions of considerable importance were made, however,\r\nby Foville, Bayle, Greding, Calmeil, Guislain, Parchappe and others.\r\nThese were confined almost entirely to a study of gross or macroscopic\r\nlesions of the brain. Griesinger in 1845 reviewed the pathological\r\nchanges in the nervous system quite thoroughly as far as they were\r\nknown at that time. It must be admitted that the greater part of our\r\nknowledge of the pathology of mental diseases was acquired at a much\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\nA very definite indication of the progress, or lack of progress, made\r\nin determining the etiology of the psychoses is the list of causes\r\nagreed upon at the International Congress of Alienists[60] in 1867:—1.\r\nPhysical causes: Artificial deformities of cranium; convulsions of\r\ninfancy and dentition; cerebral congestion (primary, not that which\r\narises in the course of certain forms of insanity); organic affections\r\nof the brain; senility; pellagra; anemia; constitutional syphilis;\r\nintermittent fever; typhoid fever; acute rheumatism; gout and chronic\r\nrheumatism; organic affections of the heart; pulmonary phthisis;\r\nintestinal worms; other acute diseases; other chronic diseases;\r\nsuppression of the hemorrhoidal flux; menstrual disorders; metastasis;\r\nalcoholic drinks; abuse of tobacco; other vegetable poisons; mineral\r\npoisons (lead, mercury, coffee, etc.); insolation; intense heat;\r\nintense cold; blows and falls upon the head; other traumatic causes. 2.\r\nMoral causes: Appertain to religion; education; love (love thwarted,\r\njealousy); family affections; fluctuations of fortune; domestic\r\ntroubles; pride; disappointed ambition; fright; irritation; anger;\r\nwounded modesty; political events; nostalgia; ennui; misanthropy;\r\nsudden joy; simple imprisonment; solitary confinement.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the New York State Commission in Lunacy in its eighth annual\r\nreport published an analysis of the assigned causes of insanity\r\ngiven in 39,369 cases admitted from 1888 to 1896. Of these 11,999\r\nwere reported as unascertained. In the remaining 27,370 cases the\r\nimportant \"assigned causes\" in the order of their frequency were as\r\nfollows: Moral causes (including domestic trouble, loss of friends,\r\nbusiness anxieties, pecuniary difficulties, grief, fright, disappointed\r\naffections, disappointed ambition, political excitement, religious\r\nexcitement, etc.) 6,608, intemperance in drink 4,763, hereditary\r\npredisposition 2,095, old age 1,723, general ill health 1,681,\r\nepilepsy 1,605, ill health following overwork 1,092, masturbation\r\n1,063, puerperal (including childbirth and abortion) 773, traumatic\r\n608, climacteric 502, la grippe 442, sunstroke 402, physical diseases\r\n375, syphilis 368, cerebral diseases 312, intemperance in drink and\r\nnarcotics 277, congenital defects 223, shock from injury 167, fever\r\n147, uterine and ovarian disease 132, pregnancy 109, privation and\r\noverwork 110, etc. These are given in detail not that they throw any\r\nlight on the question of etiology but that they are quite significant\r\nas to the ideas prevalent on this subject only a few years ago. In\r\njustice to the Commission in Lunacy attention should be called to\r\nthe fact that this tabulation does not purport to give actual causes\r\nbut those officially \"assigned\" by the examining authorities or\r\nothers interested. Clouston[61] in 1911, in making a statistical study\r\nof 11,346 cases admitted to the Royal Edinburgh Mental Hospital in\r\nthe course of thirty-five years, enumerated a long list of causes\r\nshown in the hospital reports. It is interesting to note that they\r\ninclude nursing, disordered menstruation, self abuse, sexual excess,\r\nsurgical operations, bronchitis, prostatic disease, lupus, commencing\r\nmenstruation, transference of morbid action from other organs to the\r\nbrain, excessive tobacco smoking, chloroform inhalation, excessive\r\nnumber of children, religious excitement, marriage, changes of\r\nresidence, sedentary habits, political excitement, bad temper, the\r\nQueen's Jubilee, etc. As he says, \"No other disease has anything like\r\nthis list of 107 causes. A black and terrible roll it is. Poor humanity\r\nhas much to contend with to keep sound in mind.\" Analyzing these\r\nstatistical findings, Clouston concludes that \"bad heredity, congenital\r\ndefects, and previous attacks are the great predisposing causes, and\r\nthat alcohol, the crises of life, epilepsy, the various forms of brain\r\npoisons and the gross brain and nervous diseases constitute the mass of\r\nexciting causes. Together they account for over seventy per cent of the\r\ndefects and diseases of the mind that come under my observation.\"\r\n\r\nA reference to the statistical reports of the past as published by\r\nthe hospitals of this and other countries will show nothing radically\r\ndifferent until within the last few years. It will readily be observed\r\nthat fundamentals were almost entirely lost sight of and nonessentials\r\noveremphasized. Masturbation, for instance, is often a symptom of\r\ndementia praecox and other forms of mental disease, but is not now\r\nlooked upon as an important etiological factor. The immediate\r\ncause, so-called, is usually a mere incident, often not without some\r\nsignificance, but bearing little if any definite relation to the\r\nfundamental underlying condition responsible for a mental breakdown.\r\nThe studies of Meyer, Hoch, Kraepelin, Freud, Jung, Bleuler and\r\nmany others have shown that in manic-depressive insanity, dementia\r\npraecox and various other psychoses we are dealing with very definite\r\nconstitutional conditions, morbid temperaments, personality defects,\r\netc., which are responsible for the maladjustments leading to the\r\ndevelopment of psychoses. Financial reverses, domestic difficulties,\r\nthe death of near relatives, the ordinary hardships and disappointments\r\nof life, even ill health, do not as a rule mean the development\r\nof a psychosis in the normal, properly balanced individual. In\r\nthe constitutionally predisposed, the love affair, the loss of a\r\nposition, the upsetting factor, whatever it may be, is merely the\r\n\"straw that breaks the camel's back\" and is nothing more than an\r\naccident of fate, a pure coincidence. Any other comparatively trifling\r\noccurrence out of the ordinary, any difficult situation which the\r\nmakeup of the individual could not adequately meet and react to, would\r\nhave accomplished the same result. There are, however, of course,\r\ncertain psychic traumas to which these inadequate personalities are\r\nparticularly susceptible.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that without any doubt there are conditions for\r\nwhich defective heredity is largely responsible. It is often difficult\r\nto determine the actual rôle which this plays in a given case. Efforts\r\nhave been made to reduce the study of these factors to a definite\r\nscientific basis. In 1865 Gregor Mendel,[62] Abbot of Brünn, published\r\nan account of a series of experiments made by him with the common pea\r\n(pisum sativum) which was destined to revolutionize our views on the\r\n subject of heredity. On crossing a tall with a dwarf plant,\r\ntall hybrids resulted with no intermediate forms. This inheritance is\r\nsaid to be due to the presence of a definite \"determiner\" in the germ\r\nplasm. All of his hybrids being of the tall variety, he designated\r\nthat character as the \"dominant,\" the dwarf being spoken of as the\r\n\"recessive.\" On the fertilization of these hybrids he obtained another\r\ngeneration, which averages three tall plants to one dwarf. Further\r\ninvestigation showed that the dwarfs always bred true, as did about one\r\nout of three of the tall varieties, the remaining two behaving as did\r\nthe original hybrids and giving three talls to one dwarf. He therefore\r\nobserved that he was dealing with three varieties of inheritance, the\r\ndwarfs which bred true, the talls which bred true and the talls with a\r\nfixed proportion of talls and dwarfs. The phenomenon as noted by Mendel\r\nis not, however, universal in its application. Curiously enough no\r\nattention was given to Mendel's experiments until eighteen years after\r\nhis death, when his work was rediscovered by de Vries, Correns and\r\nTschermak in 1900.\r\n\r\nDavenport[63] has shown that there are six possible matings of germ\r\ncells as illustrated by the pigment of the eye:—1. Both parents,\r\npigmented iris (brown eyes) and duplex—all offspring with pigmented\r\niris and duplex; 2. Both parents brown-eyed, one duplex, one\r\nsimplex—all children brown-eyed, but half simplex; 3. One parent\r\nbrown-eyed and duplex, the other blue-eyed—all children brown-eyed\r\nand simplex; 4. Both parents brown-eyed and simplex—one-fourth of\r\nthe children brown-eyed and duplex, one-half brown-eyed and simplex,\r\nand one-fourth blue-eyed; 5. One parent brown-eyed and simplex, and\r\nthe other blue-eyed—one-half the children brown-eyed and simplex,\r\nthe other half blue-eyed; 6. Both parents blue-eyed—all children\r\nblue-eyed. It should be explained that a duplex origin means the\r\ninheritance of a character from both parents and simplex from only one.\r\nThe principles of the Mendelian laws of heredity have been applied\r\nto a study of the color of the eyes and skin, the color and form of\r\nthe hair, the stature, body weight and many other family traits such\r\nas musical knowledge, ability along artistic and literary lines,\r\nmechanical skill, etc. They have also been applied to the study of\r\nvarious diseases, such as Huntington's chorea, hereditary ataxia,\r\ndeaf-mutism, feeblemindedness, epilepsy and insanity, etc.\r\n\r\nRosanoff[64] and Orr have suggested the following hypothesis relative\r\nto the transmission of the neuropathic constitution as based on the\r\nMendelian theory:—1. Both parents being neuropathic, all children will\r\nbe neuropathic; 2. One parent being normal but with the neuropathic\r\ntaint from one grandparent, and the other parent being neuropathic,\r\nhalf the children will be normal but capable of transmitting the\r\nneuropathic constitution to their progeny, and half will themselves be\r\nneuropathic; 3. One parent being normal and of pure normal ancestry,\r\nand the other parent being neuropathic, all the children will be normal\r\nbut capable of transmitting the neuropathic makeup to their progeny; 4.\r\nBoth parents being normal, but each with the neuropathic taint from one\r\ngrandparent, one-fourth of the children will be normal and not capable\r\nof transmitting the neuropathic makeup to their progeny, one-half will\r\nbe normal but capable of transmitting the neuropathic makeup, and the\r\nremaining one-fourth will be neuropathic; 5. Both parents being normal,\r\none of pure normal ancestry and the other with the neuropathic taint\r\nfrom one grandparent, all the children will be normal; half of them\r\nwill be capable and half not capable of transmitting the neuropathic\r\nmakeup to their progeny; 6. Both parents being normal and of pure\r\nnormal ancestry, all the children will be normal and not capable of\r\ntransmitting the neuropathic makeup to their progeny.\r\n\r\nJust how much importance is to be attached to these theories is a\r\ndifficult matter to determine. A study of a considerable number of\r\nfamilies by Rosanoff[65] would appear to be very suggestive, although\r\nhis conclusions must be looked upon as fairly conservative:—\"On the\r\nwhole, taking into consideration the limited amount of material as well\r\nas the various sources of possible error, the correspondence between\r\nthe actual findings and theoretical expectation, as shown in the table,\r\nmust be regarded as strikingly close.\" On the other hand, as White[66]\r\nsays, \"In dealing with the subject of heredity, however, it must not\r\nbe forgotten that our ideas are of necessity largely founded upon\r\nhypotheses, as biological science has not yet unfolded a sufficient\r\nnumber of facts to make it possible to tell just how much, in any\r\nindividual case, must be attributed to the inherent qualities of the\r\n\"germ plasm\" and just how much to the influences of environment. The\r\nview which is pretty generally admitted among biologists at present\r\nis that there is little warrant for the belief in the Lamarckian\r\nhypothesis of the inheritance of acquired characters.\"\r\n\r\nThe New York statistical tables on heredity were discontinued in\r\n1907, at which time a total of 104,013 cases had been reported. In\r\n31,290 of these no information was available, leaving a total of\r\n72,622, excluding the not insane. A history of insanity was shown in\r\nthe paternal branch of the family in 8.6 per cent of the ascertained\r\ncases, in the maternal branch in 10.1 per cent, in both paternal\r\nand maternal in 1.7 per cent, and in collateral branches in eleven\r\nper cent,—a total of 31.4 per cent in which some form of heredity\r\nwas reported. These statistics relate only to insanity in the family\r\nhistory. There were so many sources of inaccuracy that it was not\r\nthought worth while to continue these studies after 1907. Comparisons\r\nbetween the heredity of mental cases and that of normal individuals\r\nhave been rather surprising. Koller, for instance, as quoted by\r\nKraepelin,[67] in a comparison of 370 healthy with a similar number\r\nof insane individuals found a history of psychopathic defects in the\r\nimmediate families of fifty-nine per cent of the former and 76.8 per\r\ncent of the latter. Diem[68] in 1905 made an analysis of the family\r\nhistory of 1193 healthy individuals. This was compared with 1850 mental\r\ncases. Neuropathic heredity of some kind was found in 78.2 per cent of\r\nthe mental cases and 66.9 per cent of the healthy individuals. There\r\nwas, however, a history of mental diseases in the families of 38.3 per\r\ncent of the insane patients as compared with 7.1 per cent of the normal\r\nindividuals. Somewhat different results were noted in a study of the\r\nparents. There was a paternal or maternal history of insanity in 18.1\r\nper cent of the families of the mental cases as compared with 2.2 per\r\ncent in the cases of the normal individuals. In the direct parentage,\r\nKoller found mental diseases in 57.3 per cent of the families of the\r\ninsane as compared with 28 per cent in the case of normal individuals.\r\nKraepelin states that the influence of the father is greater in\r\nheredity than is that of the mother. The father, furthermore, usually\r\ntransmits to the son while the mother influences the daughter more.\r\n\r\nHeredity varies with the psychoses, having its greatest influence in\r\nthe transmission of manic-depressive attacks, epileptic and hysterical\r\nconditions, nervousness, compulsive and impulsive insanity, sexual\r\nperversions and morbid personalities (Kraepelin). As the result of a\r\nstudy of two thousand cases, Pilcz[69] (1907) found that in alcoholism\r\nheredity was most likely to manifest itself in the form of alcoholism,\r\nepilepsy and imbecility or manic-depressive psychoses. In the\r\nprogenitors of epileptics he found epilepsy and migraine. Apoplectics\r\nshowed a family history of paralysis, arteriosclerosis, senile dementia\r\nor melancholia. Senile dementia preceded paralysis, arteriosclerosis,\r\nfeeblemindedness and dementia praecox. Tabes and paralysis apparently\r\nfrequently precede paralysis and dementia praecox. The various forms of\r\nalcoholic psychoses furthermore show a tendency to repeat themselves\r\nin the offspring of alcoholics. Similar heredity is said to be the\r\ngeneral rule in manic-depressive psychoses, epilepsy and alcoholism,\r\nand to a less extent in arteriosclerosis. Heredity, in so far as it\r\nis related to mental diseases, may be said to be largely a question\r\nof the transmission of a neuropathic or psychopathic constitution or\r\npredisposition. Various psychoses are now held to be the direct result\r\nof constitutional causes or hereditary influences. This is probably\r\ntrue of manic-depressive insanity, Huntington's chorea, involution\r\nmelancholia, dementia praecox, paranoia and paranoid conditions,\r\nepileptic psychoses, the psychoneuroses and neuroses, psychopathic\r\npersonality and mental deficiency. It is true that some of these\r\nconditions develop as the immediate results of certain predisposing\r\nfactors and that in frequent instances no evidences of heredity can\r\nbe found. It is also true that various authorities maintain that\r\na predisposition to the development of certain psychoses may be\r\nacquired. If, however, we assume that the above mentioned psychoses are\r\nconstitutional in their nature and due primarily to heredity, it may\r\nbe definitely stated that, based on recent statistical studies,\r\nhereditary influences account for from fifty-five to sixty per cent of\r\nthe mental cases admitted to our institutions. It may be pointed out,\r\nas an objection to this suggestion, that although manic-depressive\r\npsychoses often develop in an emotionally unstable or cyclothymic\r\npersonality and dementia praecox is associated with certain\r\npeculiarities of makeup, not all of these cases show clear evidences\r\nof constitutional origins. This is unquestionably true. It is equally\r\ntrue, on the other hand, that heredity is also probably very often a\r\nfactor in the production of the senile and arteriosclerotic conditions,\r\nvarious nervous diseases, alcoholism and drug habits.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the subject of heredity we are on much more certain\r\nground. There is no question whatever as to the rôle played by\r\ntraumatism, senility, arteriosclerosis, syphilis, brain and nervous\r\ndiseases, alcoholism, exogenous toxins, epilepsy, pellagra and somatic\r\ndiseases in the causation of mental disorders. In an analysis of\r\n4,079 cases examined at the Munich Clinic, Kraepelin[70] found the\r\nfollowing factors involved:—1. Physical diseases, infections and gross\r\nbrain lesions, 1.3 per cent; 2. Syphilis and metasyphilis, 10.3 per\r\ncent (general paresis 9.4 per cent); 3. Toxins—alcohol, morphine,\r\ncocaine, etc., 22.8 per cent (alcoholic psychoses 22.4 per cent);\r\n4. Traumatic neuroses and prison psychoses, 2.5 per cent; 5. The\r\npresenile and senile psychoses, arteriosclerosis, etc., 5.6 per cent;\r\n6. Dementia praecox, epilepsy, idiocy and imbecility, 27.2 per cent; 7.\r\nPsychopathic and hysterical states, and manic-depressive insanity, 30.3\r\nper cent. Conditions existing in our hospitals and clinics are somewhat\r\ndifferent. As the result of a study of over seventy thousand first\r\nadmissions to forty-eight hospitals in sixteen different states we are\r\nnow in a position to speak quite definitely as to the frequency of the\r\nconditions above referred to as etiological factors. Traumatic psychoses\r\nquite uniformly represent a little less than one-half of one per cent\r\nof the admissions to our institutions. The senile psychoses constitute\r\napproximately ten per cent and arteriosclerosis five per cent of the\r\ntotal. General paresis averages about twelve per cent in the New York\r\nhospitals and from seven to ten per cent in the other states. Cerebral\r\nsyphilis amounts to a little less than one per cent of the cases. It\r\nshould be said that in the large cities the rate for syphilis is, in\r\nsome instances at least, twice as high as that given. Brain tumor,\r\nwith all other brain and nervous diseases, only constitutes about one\r\nand one-half per cent of our admissions. Alcoholism, which has been\r\nresponsible for as high as ten per cent of all admissions, from time\r\nto time, has been decreasing gradually during the last five years and\r\nin New York in 1920 constituted less than two per cent. Epileptic\r\npsychoses in our state hospitals amount to from one to two and one-half\r\nper cent of the total. As a general rule pellagra is not a factor of\r\nany consequence, amounting to less than one-half of one per cent of\r\nthe admissions. In a few of the southern hospitals large numbers of\r\npellagra are encountered. The psychoses accompanying somatic diseases\r\nare represented by from three to four per cent of the whole number.\r\nIn addition to this, there is still a considerable number of cases\r\nreported from the hospitals as being caused by psychic trauma of\r\nvarious kinds. These represent the acute psychoses usually resulting\r\nfrom mental and emotional upsets but with nothing which definitely\r\npoints to constitutional disorders or hereditary influences.\r\n\r\nIf we speak of predisposing causes, some reference should be made\r\nto the influence of the physiological landmarks which are of so\r\nmuch significance in the life of the individual in more ways than\r\none—puberty, adolescence, the climacterium and the senium. A no\r\nless noteworthy factor in the female sex is the puerperium. These\r\nperiods of life are of tremendous importance in the development of\r\nthe psychoses. It is customary to speak of age, sex, race, civil\r\ncondition, degree of education, climate, civilization, etc., as factors\r\nin the production of mental diseases. Not much is to be said on these\r\nquestions, nor are they closely related to the subject. On January\r\n1, 1920, there were 232,680 patients in the hospitals for mental\r\ndiseases in the United States. Fifty-two per cent of these were men and\r\nforty-eight per cent women. This represents about the difference that\r\nhas been shown for many years. The reduction in alcoholic psychoses\r\nmay affect this ultimately. The striking exceptions to this ratio are\r\nMassachusetts and New York, where the number of women has slightly\r\nexceeded the men for a number of years. The admission rate for men\r\nis, however, slightly higher than that for women in both of those\r\nstates. Less than one-half of one per cent of the patients admitted to\r\nthe New York hospitals are under fifteen years of age. In that state\r\napproximately five per cent have been between fifteen and nineteen\r\nyears old. In Massachusetts the percentage of persons admitted who\r\nwere under twenty years of age has averaged 8.5 quite consistently for\r\nsome time. The admission rate, for twenty to twenty-five, twenty-five\r\nto thirty, thirty to thirty-five and thirty-five to forty years of age\r\nin Massachusetts and New York has averaged from ten to eleven per cent\r\nfor each of those periods for several years. From the age of forty\r\nto fifty the admission rate is about 8.5 per cent, and from fifty to\r\nsixty between five and six per cent. Nine per cent of the admissions in\r\nMassachusetts and eight per cent in New York are seventy years of age\r\nor over. The statistics on race, birthplace and the psychoses of the\r\nvarious races are shown in detail in the chapter on Immigration. The\r\nadmission rate in New York is almost exactly the same for the married\r\nand the unmarried, the former constituting about thirty-nine per cent\r\nand the latter forty. In Massachusetts the single first admissions\r\namount to about forty-three per cent and the married approximately\r\nforty per cent. Throughout the country generally the unmarried slightly\r\npredominate. The percentage of widowed in Massachusetts and New York\r\nvaries from thirteen to fourteen per cent. The divorced constitute\r\nonly about one per cent of all admissions. As to education, it may be\r\nsaid that about nine per cent of all first admissions are illiterate,\r\nfrom fifteen to twenty per cent can read and write only, about sixty\r\nper cent have had a high school and two per cent a college education.\r\nA study of economic conditions shows that from fifteen to seventeen\r\nper cent are dependent, from sixty to seventy per cent are rated as\r\nmarginal, and from eleven to thirteen per cent as being in comfortable\r\ncircumstances. In Massachusetts and New York about eighty-five per\r\ncent of the admissions come from a city environment and from twelve\r\nto fifteen per cent from rural communities. It is interesting to note\r\nthat in 1919 eighteen per cent of the admissions in Massachusetts and\r\nNew York were reported as being intemperate in their habits, with over\r\nfifty per cent abstinent.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be said that the important etiological factors\r\nin the production of mental disease are heredity, senility, syphilis,\r\narteriosclerosis, somatic diseases, mental deficiency, epilepsy,\r\ndiseases of the brain and nervous system, alcoholism, drugs, traumatism\r\nand mental stress and shocks of various kinds. It is hardly necessary\r\nto add that our information on this subject is far from complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION AND MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nA history of the development of our western civilization is very\r\nlargely a study of the process of assimilation of the various racial\r\nelements representing a new population. While it must be conceded\r\nthat we are indebted to European countries for much that has been\r\ncontributory to the welfare and success of American institutions, it\r\nis equally true that the tremendous increase in mental diseases and\r\ndefects here is to be attributed in no small degree to immigration.\r\nThis constitutes a problem of social and economic importance which is\r\nworthy of serious consideration. Perhaps no better evidence of this\r\nfact can be offered than a study of such statistics as are available\r\nrelating to the thirty-three millions of people coming to the United\r\nStates from other countries during the last century. This would seem\r\nto be particularly indicated at this time, in view of the fact that\r\nthe conclusion of the war has brought about the necessity of a new\r\nadjustment of our relations with other countries.\r\n\r\nImmigration to the United States has varied greatly from time to time.\r\nIt is a well known fact that the founders of our government were\r\npractically all of English, Dutch, German or Scotch-Irish extraction.\r\nUnfortunately no information of any consequence is available regarding\r\nthe aliens entering the country prior to 1820, when their study\r\nwas first undertaken by the federal authorities. As far as can be\r\ndetermined, during the ensuing ten years about 128,000 were admitted\r\nat the various ports of entry. The history of immigration since that\r\ntime has been determined very largely by existing conditions in other\r\ncountries. The famines and political disturbances in Ireland between\r\n1840 and 1850 were the occasion of a large influx, concededly of a\r\nhighly desirable type. The nature of the tide of incoming immigrants\r\nwas changed by the revolutionary troubles in Germany during the decade\r\nfollowing 1848. There was a decrease for a time during the civil war.\r\nThis was soon followed by a considerable increase which continued\r\nquite consistently until the outbreak of the world war. There would at\r\nthis time seem to be every reason for thinking that an unprecedented\r\ninvasion can be expected during the next twenty-five years as a result\r\nof conditions prevailing abroad unless some restrictions are imposed.\r\nIn 1850 and 1860 the number of Irish people in the United States\r\nexceeded the German born. The 1890 census showed a predominance of the\r\nlatter race and they have exceeded the Irish element in the population\r\nfor some time. Nearly a million Germans were admitted between 1880 and\r\n1885. Since 1890, however, the number of Irish and Germans entering\r\nhave both decreased markedly. After the Spanish-American war a great\r\nincrease in immigration was noted and the rate of admission per year\r\nreached a million in 1905, but the source of supply had entirely\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nSalmon[71] has shown that in spite of the fact that in 1882 only 12.9\r\nper cent of all incoming aliens admitted were from those countries,\r\neighty-one per cent of all immigration from Europe in 1907 came from\r\nAustria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, Poland, Portugal,\r\nRoumania, Russia, Servia, Syria and Turkey. In 1882, 87.1 per cent of\r\nthose admitted came from England, Germany, Holland, Norway, Sweden,\r\nSwitzerland and Belgium. The races represented by the new tide of\r\nimmigration, according to Salmon, were Slavic, thirty per cent,\r\nItalian, twenty-six per cent, and Hebrew, fifteen per cent, the\r\nremainder being made up of various other miscellaneous elements. This\r\nchange is shown by the fact that the immigration from Austria-Hungary,\r\nwhich amounted to only 711,926 from 1820 to 1896, increased to\r\n2,303,323 during the first decade of the present century. Five hundred\r\nand thirty-four thousand three hundred and thirty-six were admitted\r\nfrom Russia between 1820 and 1896 and 1,756,027 between 1900 and 1911.\r\nThe Italian immigration, which amounted to 676,826 between 1820 and\r\n1896, increased to 2,228,759 between 1901 and 1911 (Salmon[72]). The\r\nnumerical status of immigration by decades is shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n  From 1831 to 1840          528,721\r\n       1841 to 1850        1,604,805\r\n       1851 to 1860        2,648,912\r\n       1861 to 1870        2,369,878\r\n       1871 to 1880        2,812,191\r\n       1881 to 1890        5,246,613\r\n       1891 to 1900        3,687,564\r\n       1901 to 1910        8,795,386\r\n       1911 to 1920        6,747,381\r\n\r\nA study made by the United States Immigration Commission some years ago\r\nshowed that of 68,942 foreign born males employed in various mining\r\nand manufacturing industries, and who had been in the United States\r\nfor five years or more, only 33.3 per cent had obtained naturalization\r\npapers. Of 246,673 of this same class representing non-English speaking\r\nraces, only 53.2 per cent had learned the language of this country to\r\nany extent. A report made by the Commissioner General of Immigration\r\nshowed that of 719,906 immigrants over fourteen years of age and\r\nadmitted from 1899 to 1909, 26.6 per cent could neither read nor write\r\nand 29.8 per cent had no occupation. The following table shows the\r\npercentage of foreign born in the population of the United States from\r\ntime to time as stated in official reports:—\r\n\r\n  1850    9.7  per cent\r\n  1860   13.3   \"   \"\r\n  1870   14.4   \"   \"\r\n  1880   13.3   \"   \"\r\n  1890   14.7   \"   \"\r\n  1900   13.6   \"   \"\r\n  1910   14.7   \"   \"\r\n  1920   12.96  \"   \"  (white only)\r\n\r\nThe foreign born population naturally varies more or less in different\r\nparts of the country. In New York state it was twenty-six per cent in\r\n1870, 23.8 in 1880, 26.2 in 1890, 26.1 in 1900, 29.9 in 1910, and 26.8\r\nper cent in 1920. In Massachusetts it was 30.6 per cent in 1895, 30.2\r\nin 1900, 30.3 in 1905, 31.5 in 1910, 31.2 in 1915, and 28 per cent in\r\n1920.\r\n\r\nWe have little authentic information relative to the institution\r\npopulation prior to 1903. The United States Census Bureau in its\r\nreport of 1904 on the insane in hospitals shows that in 1903 there\r\nwere 140,312 patients, of which number 47,078, or 34.3 per cent, were\r\nof foreign birth. The percentage of foreign born in state hospitals in\r\nvarious parts of the country at that time were as follows:—\r\n\r\n  New York                46.9 per cent\r\n  Massachusetts           42.0  \"   \"\r\n  New Jersey              39.5  \"   \"\r\n  Pennsylvania            30.9  \"   \"\r\n  District of Columbia    36.7  \"   \"\r\n  Connecticut             35.4  \"   \"\r\n  Michigan                43.5  \"   \"\r\n  Illinois                41.6  \"   \"\r\n  Wisconsin               50.9  \"   \"\r\n  Minnesota               63.5  \"   \"\r\n  North Dakota            68.4  \"   \"\r\n  South Dakota            49.9  \"   \"\r\n  Montana                 57.8  \"   \"\r\n  Nevada                  63.1  \"   \"\r\n\r\nIn 1912 an investigation was made of the foreign born in the New York\r\nstate hospitals. As a result of the census taken, it was found that\r\nof 31,624 patients, 13,728, or 43.4 per cent, were foreign born. Of\r\nthis number 4,487 had been naturalized and 9,241, or 29.2 per cent\r\nof the total hospital population were aliens. At the Manhattan State\r\nHospital in New York City, out of a total of 4,570 patients 2,526 were\r\nforeign born and only 708 had been naturalized. The Central Islip State\r\nHospital at the same time had 4,438 patients. Of this number 2,803\r\nwere foreign born and only 891 were naturalized citizens. Thus, at the\r\nManhattan State Hospital 39.8 per cent and at the Central Islip State\r\nHospital 43.1 per cent of the patients were aliens. It was shown that\r\nthe average hospital residence of the insane in the state was 9.85\r\nyears. Based on the maintenance expenditures for 1912 it was estimated\r\nthat the cost to New York for caring for its 9,241 aliens in the state\r\nhospitals was $2,579,902.78 per year, and for their entire hospital\r\nresidence, over twenty-five million dollars.[73] Of the first admissions\r\nto the New York hospitals for the eight years beginning October 1,\r\n1904, and ending September 30, 1910, 46.2 per cent were foreign born.\r\nThe citizenship of the first admissions for this same period is shown\r\nby the following table:—\r\n\r\n  _Year_       _Aliens_\r\n\r\n   1905     28.4 per cent\r\n   1906     31.4  \"   \"\r\n   1907     32.6  \"   \"\r\n   1908     33.9  \"   \"\r\n   1909     33.4  \"   \"\r\n   1910     33.0  \"   \"\r\n   1911     32.9  \"   \"\r\n   1912     29.3  \"   \"\r\n\r\nIt was also shown that 14.7 per cent of the aliens admitted in 1905\r\nhad been in the United States less than three years, in 1906, 18.7, in\r\n1907, 21.8, in 1908, 20.1, in 1909, 18.1, in 1910, 15.5, in 1911, 14.9\r\nand in 1912, 18.1 per cent. The birthplace and citizenship of first\r\nadmissions to the New York state hospitals since 1912 is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:—\r\n\r\n  _Year_    _Foreign born_        _Aliens_\r\n\r\n  1913      47.0 per cent       22.5 per cent\r\n  1914      46.7  \"   \"         25.2  \"   \"\r\n  1915      47.0  \"   \"         26.4  \"   \"\r\n  1916      48.5  \"   \"         27.8  \"   \"\r\n  1917      47.8  \"   \"         27.1  \"   \"\r\n  1918      46.4  \"   \"         27.5  \"   \"\r\n  1919      46.8  \"   \"         26.4  \"   \"\r\n  1920      45.3  \"   \"         24.8  \"   \"\r\n\r\nThe percentage of the foreign born as shown by the first admissions to\r\nthe Massachusetts state hospitals during the last eleven years was as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  1910    44.88 per cent\r\n  1911    44.65  \"   \"\r\n  1912    44.40  \"   \"\r\n  1913    45.30  \"   \"\r\n  1914    45.75  \"   \"\r\n  1915    45.59  \"   \"\r\n  1916    43.87  \"   \"\r\n  1917    43.40  \"   \"\r\n  1918    43.07  \"   \"\r\n  1919    43.38  \"   \"\r\n  1920    42.18  \"   \"\r\n\r\nThe percentage of aliens as shown by the first admissions to\r\nMassachusetts hospitals was 26.40 per cent in 1918, 27.54 in 1919 and\r\n22.73 per cent in 1920.\r\n\r\nStudies of the population of the New York state hospitals show that the\r\naliens have for a period of several years constituted nearly thirty per\r\ncent of the entire number. The influence which immigration may have\r\nhad in determining the relative frequency of various psychoses in our\r\ninstitutions is an exceedingly interesting question. In speaking of the\r\nsusceptibility of certain races to special types of disease, Salmon[74]\r\nsays, \"This is particularly true of mental diseases, for if racial\r\ncharacteristics profoundly affect political, social and religious\r\nideals we must look for a similar influence upon the individual makeup\r\nwhich so largely determines trends in mental disease. All those who are\r\nfamiliar with mental diseases among the Japanese in California testify\r\nto the remarkable tendency to suicide in that race, not only in\r\ndepressed conditions but in conditions in which suicidal tendencies, in\r\nother races, are not frequent. This is in accordance with the general\r\nattitude of the Japanese toward self-destruction. The strong tendency\r\nto delusional trends of a persecutory nature in West Indian negroes,\r\nthe frequency with which we find hidden sexual complexes among the\r\nHebrews and the remarkable prevalence of mutism among Poles, even\r\nin psychoses in which mutism is not a common symptom, are familiar\r\nexamples of the influence of racial traits upon mental diseases.\"\r\nAs the result of a special study of this subject Salmon has reached\r\nthe following conclusions: \"1. The psychoses more prevalent among\r\nHebrews than in the native stock are manic depressive psychosis,\r\ndementia praecox, the psychoneuroses, and psychoses associated with\r\nconstitutional inferiority. 2. The absence of alcoholic psychoses\r\namong Hebrews is the most striking clinical fact in connection with\r\nimmigration. In 1909 there were but 3 patients with alcoholic psychoses\r\nin 448 Hebrews admitted to all the New York state hospitals. 3. The\r\nvery high prevalence of general paresis among Italians bears a direct\r\nrelation to the high prevalence of venereal diseases among Italians in\r\nNew York.... 4. Italians show a freedom from alcoholic psychoses second\r\nonly to Hebrews. 5. Italians exceed the native born in the prevalence\r\nof epileptic psychoses, infective exhaustive psychoses and dementia\r\npraecox.... 7. From the data available, alcoholic psychoses are found\r\nto be more prevalent among Slavs than among any other races of the new\r\nimmigration, but not as prevalent as among the native-born. 8. General\r\nparesis is nearly twice as prevalent among Slavs as in the native-born,\r\nbut not so prevalent as among the Italians. Dementia praecox is more\r\nprevalent among the Slavs than among the native-born.\"\r\n\r\nThe racial representation as shown by statistics of first admissions\r\nis fairly constant in New York state, at least, as is shown by the\r\nfollowing table of percentages:—\r\n\r\n      _Race_           _1916_    _1917_    _1918_    _1919_    _1920_\r\n\r\n  African                3.1       3.3       3.9       3.7       3.8\r\n  English                7.6       5.7       5.1       4.9       5.1\r\n  German                14.3      13.5      12.5      11.7      11.7\r\n  Hebrew                12.2      11.6      12.2      11.7      10.5\r\n  Irish                 19.8      19.5      17.3      16.7      16.5\r\n  Italian                6.3       6.9       7.1       8.1       8.5\r\n  Magyar                  .8        .9       1.0        .7        .8\r\n  Scandinavian           1.9       2.2       2.2       2.1       2.0\r\n  Slavonic               5.7       5.8       5.7       5.4       6.0\r\n  Mixed                 12.4      16.0      23.6      23.3      24.1\r\n  Others                 5.7       5.6       4.4       4.9       6.2\r\n  Unascertained         10.2       9.0       5.0       6.9       4.8\r\n\r\nThe 1916 report of the Commission on Mental Diseases shows the\r\nfollowing analysis of the nativity of the 34,300 first admissions to\r\nthe Massachusetts state hospitals covering a period of thirteen years\r\n(1904-1916):—\r\n\r\n   _Birthplace_       _Number_\r\n\r\n   United States      18,757\r\n   Africa                  7\r\n   Armenia                68\r\n   Austria               319\r\n   Azores                187\r\n   Canada              3,315\r\n   England             1,359\r\n   Finland               250\r\n   Germany               486\r\n   Greece                129\r\n   Ireland             5,033\r\n   Italy                 719\r\n   Nova Scotia           136\r\n   Poland                190\r\n   Russia              1,139\r\n   Scotland              381\r\n   Sweden                539\r\n   Turkey                100\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that these statistics represent birthplace\r\nand not race.

It will be noted that the\r\nHebrews and Italians have the highest rate for dementia praecox, the\r\npercentage shown by these races being much higher than any of the\r\nothers. The Germans, Italians and Hebrews, in the order mentioned,\r\nhave the highest rates for manic-depressive psychoses. The frequency\r\nof alcoholic psychoses as shown by the Irish is nearly double that of\r\nany of the others. The Slavonic race has the highest rate for general\r\nparesis, followed in close succession by the French and Germans. The\r\nhighest rate for senile and arteriosclerotic psychoses combined is\r\nshown by the races of mixed origin, the next highest by the English,\r\nclosely followed by the Irish. The most common psychosis in every\r\ninstance is dementia praecox. In the admissions to the institutions for\r\nthe criminal insane in New York the highest percentages are represented\r\nby the Irish, Italian and Hebrew races, as shown in another chapter.\r\nDuring a period of six years (1912 to 1918) a study of first admissions\r\nto the New York state hospitals shows an incidence of dementia praecox\r\nin the native-born of 75.2 per hundred thousand of the population and\r\nin the foreign born of 161.4. The importance of this is shown by the\r\nfact that over fifty per cent of the entire hospital population is made\r\nup of cases of dementia praecox.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of some supervision of immigration for the purpose of\r\npreventing the entrance of undesirable aliens has long been recognized.\r\nAs early as 1824 the state of New York tried by legislation to prevent\r\nthe admission of the insane and mental defectives. This effort was\r\na failure, probably owing to the fact that the proposed enactments\r\nwould have compelled the companies responsible for the entrance of\r\nundesirable aliens to remove them if they became a public charge. The\r\nintroduction of discordant racial elements from abroad at one time\r\ndisturbed the equilibrium of the entire country. The agitation for the\r\nrestriction of immigration before the civil war led to the formation\r\nof a political organization known as the \"Native American\" or \"Know\r\nNothing\" party, as it was usually called. It at one time had forty\r\nrepresentatives in Congress and nominated a candidate for President\r\nin 1856. These disturbed conditions led to the consideration of this\r\nsubject by Congress as early as 1838 and the Judiciary Committee\r\nrecommended legislation prohibiting the entrance of idiots, lunatics\r\nand those suffering from incurable diseases or convicted of crime.\r\nThe action of several foreign countries in pardoning murderers with\r\nthe provision that they should emigrate to the United States led to\r\na resolution of protest by Congress in 1860 and shortly thereafter\r\na statute intended to encourage immigration was repealed. An\r\ninvestigation made by the United States Immigration Commission brought\r\nto light the fact that the great influx of foreigners was largely\r\ncaused by the agents of the steamboat companies abroad and that they\r\nhad \"five or six thousand ticket agents in Galicia alone.\"[77]\r\n\r\nThe activities of those opposed to the indiscriminate entrance of\r\nobjectionable aliens led to the federal enactment of August 3, 1882.\r\nThe Secretary of the Treasury was charged with the duty of prohibiting\r\nthe landing of lunatics, idiots and persons liable to become a\r\npublic charge. The provisions for the execution of this law were not\r\nsatisfactory and it was amended by an act of 1891. This made it a\r\nmisdemeanor to bring in any of the above proscribed classes and imposed\r\na fine of over one thousand dollars upon anyone guilty of so doing.\r\nSection 11 provided that aliens entering in violation of this law could\r\nbe returned at any time within one year thereafter at the expense of\r\nthe person or persons, vessel, transportation company or corporation\r\nresponsible for their entry, and further, that those becoming public\r\ncharges within one year from causes existing prior to landing should\r\nbe considered as having entered in violation of law. The provisions\r\nof this statute were unchanged until the act of March 3, 1903. This\r\nexcluded persons insane within five years previous to landing, those\r\nhaving had two or more previous attacks at any time, paupers and all\r\nothers liable to become a public charge. Section 17 delegated to\r\nthe officers of the United States Public Health Service the duty of\r\ndetermining the condition of all immigrants. Section 20 provided that\r\naliens coming to the United States in violation of law, or who were\r\nfound to be public charges from causes existing prior to landing, could\r\nbe deported at any time within two years. Section 21 authorized the\r\nSecretary of Commerce and Labor to deport any alien within three years\r\nof entering in violation of the act.\r\n\r\nAn important step in the legislative restriction of immigration was\r\nthe amendment of Feb. 20, 1907. This made mandatory the exclusion\r\nof idiots, imbeciles, the feebleminded, epileptics, insane, all who\r\nhad been insane within five years and persons having had two or more\r\nattacks of insanity at any time, or who were likely to become a public\r\ncharge, as well as individuals not comprehended in the foregoing\r\nexcluded classes but found to be suffering from mental or physical\r\ndefects of such a nature as to affect their ability to earn a living.\r\nSection 20 provided that an alien entering in violation of law or\r\nbecoming a public charge from causes existing prior to landing should,\r\nupon the warrant of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor, be taken into\r\ncustody and deported to the country from whence he came at any time\r\nwithin three years after the date of his entry into the United States.\r\nThe cost of this removal was to be a charge upon the owners of the\r\nvessel or transportation line immediately responsible. When the mental\r\nor physical condition of the alien was such as to require personal\r\ncare or attention, the Secretary of Commerce and Labor was authorized\r\nto employ a suitable person for that purpose. This was a great step\r\nin advance. There were, however, some very great difficulties to be\r\novercome. The force placed at the disposal of the Public Health Service\r\nfor the inspection and examination of incoming immigrants was entirely\r\ninadequate and one or two men were sometimes responsible for the\r\nexamination of several thousands aliens in a day. This was, of course,\r\nimpossible. The burden of proof in showing that the mental condition\r\nwas due to causes existing prior to landing, furthermore, devolved upon\r\nthe persons requesting deportation. It was impossible in many instances\r\nto submit actual proof even where there could be no reasonable doubt as\r\nto the facts. This led to great difficulties and much dissatisfaction.\r\nAnother serious objection to the provisions of this law was the\r\nrequirement that only such persons could be deported as were likely to\r\nbecome a public charge. In many instances such persons were supported\r\nby private funds until they were no longer deportable, after which they\r\nbecame a burden upon the state in which they resided.\r\n\r\nThese conditions were much improved by the action of the Sixty-fourth\r\nCongress in 1917. This definitely excluded \"all idiots, imbeciles,\r\nfeebleminded persons, epileptics, insane persons; persons who have\r\nhad one or more attacks of insanity at any time previously; persons\r\nof constitutional psychopathic inferiority,\" etc., or \"persons not\r\ncomprehended within any of the foregoing excluded classes who are found\r\nto be and are certified by the examining surgeons as being mentally\r\nor physically defective\" or persons likely to become a public charge.\r\nSection 9 provided that it shall be unlawful for any person, \"including\r\nany transportation company,\" to bring either from a foreign country\r\nor any insular possession of the United States any alien afflicted\r\nwith idiocy, insanity, imbecility, feeblemindedness, epilepsy,\r\nconstitutional psychopathic inferiority, etc., and subjected to a\r\nfine any person or persons so doing. The Secretary of Labor was also\r\nauthorized to detail inspectors and matrons to duty on vessels carrying\r\nimmigrants, who shall \"report to the immigration authorities in charge\r\nat the port of landing any information of value in determining the\r\nadmissibility of such passengers that may have become known to them\r\nduring the voyage.\" It also provided that a mental examination of\r\nall arriving aliens should be made by medical officers of the United\r\nStates Public Health Service who shall certify all mental defects or\r\ndiseases observed. \"Medical officers of the United States Public Health\r\nService who have had special training in the diagnosis of insanity and\r\nmental defects shall be detailed for duty or employed at all ports\r\nof entry designated by the Secretary of Labor.\" Section 19 provided,\r\nthat any alien \"who within five years after entry becomes a public\r\ncharge from causes not affirmatively shown to have arisen subsequent to\r\nlanding\" shall, upon warrant of the Secretary of Labor, be taken into\r\ncustody and deported. The act also made provision for the first time\r\nfor a literacy test which has been a subject of discussion for years.\r\nThese amendments are of far-reaching importance and will eventually\r\nundoubtedly afford the hospitals considerable relief. The fact still\r\nremains, however, that the individual states are expending millions of\r\ndollars annually for the care and maintenance of an alien population\r\nwhich should have been excluded by the federal government. Under these\r\ncircumstances it would seem nothing more than fair that the states\r\nshould be reimbursed for the cost of carrying a burden for which they\r\nare in no way responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nMENTAL DISEASES AND CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of responsibility for criminal acts, once a legal\r\nproblem pure and simple, is now recognized as involving sociological,\r\npsychological and psychiatric considerations of far-reaching\r\nimportance. This viewpoint, none too thoroughly established even\r\nnow, represents the progress of several centuries, and still lacks\r\nadequate recognition in law. The eloquent protest against the legal\r\nconception of mental diseases written by Isaac Ray[78] in 1838 sounds\r\nlike a quotation from a recent medical journal. \"In all civilized\r\ncommunities, ancient or modern, insanity has been regarded as exempting\r\nfrom the punishment of crime, and vitiating the civil acts of those who\r\nare affected with it. The only difficulty, or diversity of opinion,\r\nconsists in determining who are really insane, in the meaning of the\r\nlaw, which has been content with merely laying down some general\r\nprinciples, and leaving their application to the discretion of the\r\njudicial authorities.... It is to be feared, that the principles, laid\r\ndown on this subject by legal authorities, have received too much of\r\nthat reverence which is naturally felt for the opinions and practices\r\nof our ancestors; and that innovations have been too much regarded,\r\nrather as the offspring of new-fangled theories, than of the steady\r\ndevelopment of medical science. In their zeal to uphold the wisdom of\r\nthe past, from the fancied desecrations of reformers and theorists,\r\nthe ministers of the law seem to have forgotten, that, in respect to\r\nthis subject, the real dignity and respectability of their profession\r\nis better upheld, by yielding to the improvements of the times, and\r\nthankfully receiving the truth from whatever quarter it may come, than\r\nby turning away with blind obstinacy from everything that conflicts\r\nwith long established maxims and decisions.\"\r\n\r\nA brief reference to the history of the development of the present\r\nlegal conceptions of criminal responsibility will justify the comments\r\nmade by Ray. The terms idiocy, lunacy and non compos mentis were all\r\nused by Coke in his \"Institutes of the Laws of England\" written, as\r\nnearly as can be determined, in 1625. A differentiation between the\r\nsignificance of the word idiot and non compos mentis appeared as\r\nearly as 1325 in the English statute \"De Praerogativa Regis,\" which\r\ndelegated various responsibilities to the crown that are recognized\r\nto this day. Sir Matthew Hale, about 1670, described a partial and a\r\ntotal insanity, the former not being accepted as relieving the accused\r\nof responsibility for the commitment of a crime. It is an interesting\r\nfact that we still hear the question of partial insanity seriously\r\ndiscussed. In 1723 Justice Tracy in a murder trial ruled that \"a\r\nprisoner in order to be acquitted on the ground of insanity must be\r\na man that is totally deprived of his understanding and memory, and\r\ndoth not know what he is doing no more than an infant, than a brute\r\nor a wild beast.\" As a result of this ruling a man was found guilty\r\nof attempting to murder a neighbor who sent devils and imps into his\r\nhouse at night for the purpose of disturbing his sleep. Fortunately\r\nthe sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. In 1812 the Attorney\r\nGeneral of England[79] ruled that \"a man may be deranged in his\r\nmind—his intellect may be insufficient for enabling him to conduct\r\nthe common affairs of life, such as disposing of his property, or\r\njudging of the claims which his respective relations have upon him; and\r\nif he be so, the administration of the country will take his affairs\r\ninto their management, and appoint to him trustees; but, at the same\r\ntime, such a man is not discharged from his responsibility for criminal\r\nacts.\"\r\n\r\nThe legal procedure of the present day is based very largely on the\r\ndecisions made at the time of the McNaughton trial in 1843. In this\r\ncase the Chief Justice, as quoted by Lord Lyndhurst, addressed the\r\nfollowing words to the jury: \"The point which at last will be submitted\r\nto you will be whether or not on the whole of the evidence you have\r\nheard you are satisfied that at the time the act was committed, for\r\nthe commission of which the prisoner stands charged, he had not that\r\ncompetent use of his understanding as not to know what he was doing\r\nwith respect to the act itself—a wicked and wrong thing—whether he\r\nknew it was a wicked and a wrong thing he had done, or that he was not\r\nsensible at the time he committed this act that it was contrary to the\r\nlaws of God and man.\" This case led to a very serious consideration\r\nof the subject in the House of Lords. As the result of an official\r\nrequest for an opinion, the majority of the judges of the court, all\r\nconcurring but one, expressed the view that \"to establish a defense on\r\nthe ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved that at the time of\r\nthe committing of the act the accused party was labouring under such a\r\ndefect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature\r\nand quality of the act he was doing; or if he did know it (sic) that he\r\ndid not know he was doing what was wrong.\"[80]\r\n\r\nThe importance and significance of these decisions, which one might\r\nvery readily assume to be obsolete and too ancient to be worthy of\r\nconsideration, will be made clear by a quotation from the penal code in\r\neffect in New York today. \"Sec. 1120 (Penal Law). Incompetency of idiot\r\nor lunatic. An act done by a person who is an idiot, imbecile, lunatic\r\nor insane is not a crime. A person cannot be tried, sentenced to any\r\npunishment or punished for a crime while he is in a state of idiocy,\r\nimbecility, lunacy or insanity so as to be incapable of understanding\r\nthe proceeding or making his defense. A person is not excused from\r\ncriminal liability as an idiot, imbecile, lunatic or insane person\r\nexcept upon proof that, at the time of committing the alleged insane\r\nact, he was laboring under such a defect of reason as 1, not to know\r\nthe nature and quality of the act he was doing; or 2, not to know that\r\nthe act was wrong.\" It will, I think, be conceded that we have, at\r\nleast, not lost ground in any way since 1843.\r\n\r\nNo less interesting is the legal definition of insanity in\r\nMassachusetts: \"The words 'insane person' and 'lunatic' shall include\r\nevery idiot, non compos, lunatic and insane and distracted person.\"\r\n(Chapter 4, Sec. 7, General Laws of Massachusetts.) In New York the\r\nterms lunatic and lunacy include every kind of unsoundness of mind\r\nexcept idiocy. (Chapter 22, Sec. 28, Consolidated Laws.) This would\r\npresumably include psychopathic personality and imbecility.\r\n\r\nNumerous court decisions have had a material bearing on the subject of\r\nresponsibility. It has been held in New York that partial or incipient\r\ninsanity is not a sufficient defense if there is still an ability to\r\nform a correct perception of the legal quality of the act and to know\r\nthat it was wrong. (People vs. Taylor, 138 N. Y. 398, 407 (1893)).\r\nA weak or disordered mind is not excused from the consequences of\r\ncrime. (People vs. Burgess, 153 N. Y. 561, 569 (1897)), etc. Generally\r\nspeaking, the legal methods of determining criminal responsibility\r\ndo not vary to any material extent with the different states. It is\r\nobvious that the responsibility for crime as defined by the courts is\r\nfar from harmonizing with the conception of competency entertained by\r\nthe medical profession. To the psychiatrist, if the criminal act is the\r\nresult of the mental condition it constitutes a symptom of the disease\r\nprocess. It is readily apparent from even a very brief reference to\r\nthe statutes that a person concededly suffering from paranoia, general\r\nparesis, dementia praecox or any other well-defined psychosis is still\r\ncriminally liable for his insane acts within certain limitations. From\r\na medical point of view the existence of a psychosis, if associated\r\nwith a consequent judgment defect, emotional instability, disturbance\r\nof volition, intellectual deterioration, delusional and particularly\r\npersecutory control, hallucinatory trends, ideas of reference, etc.,\r\nis of itself quite sufficient to explain criminal acts in the insane.\r\nThis, however, as has been shown, is not the legal point of view.\r\nThe accused is fully responsible unless it can be shown that he is\r\nsuffering from such a defect of reason as not to appreciate the quality\r\nor nature of his act or that the act is wrong. There is no other legal\r\nstandard. It is a well-known fact that many persons adjudged insane by\r\nthe courts and committed to our institutions are fully competent to\r\ndiscriminate between right and wrong from an ethical point of view,\r\nalthough legally held to be incompetent and unsafe to be at large.\r\nThese divergent viewpoints presumably are due to the fact that the law\r\nmoves only with a degree of dignity which theoretically guarantees\r\nabsolute security in avoiding any possible sources of error. It\r\nnevertheless is responsible for many miscarriages of justice.\r\n\r\nEfforts to remedy this state of affairs have been made repeatedly\r\nby the medical profession. The American Psychiatric Association\r\nhas devoted a great deal of time and attention to this subject,\r\nunfortunately without any very concrete results. The last\r\nofficial action taken was the unanimous approval of the following\r\nresolutions:—[81]\r\n\r\n\"Resolved: 1. That the proved rarity of wrong acquittals on the ground\r\nof insanity is the strongest evidence that the abuse of the insanity\r\nplea in criminal cases has been unwarrantably exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the insanity plea is not by any means raised as often as it\r\nshould be, to prevent the frequent miscarriage of justice arising from\r\nthe conviction and imprisonment of insane persons whose true mental\r\ncondition has not been recognized.\r\n\r\n\"3. That the abuses which have crept into the method of presenting\r\nmedical expert testimony have been largely the result of established\r\nlegal tests and procedures, although their correction does not require\r\nradical change in the laws.\r\n\r\n\"4. That inaccessibility of the evidence on both sides of the case is\r\nthe chief cause of defective medical testimony.\r\n\r\n\"5. That whenever possible the medical witness should not testify\r\nunless he has had an opportunity to make both a mental and a physical\r\nexamination of the person in whose behalf the plea of insanity is\r\nraised.\r\n\r\n\"6. That we consider the hypothetical question as ordinarily presented\r\nto be unscientific, misleading and dangerous to medical repute and\r\nthat the evidence on both sides should always be included in its\r\npresentation to medical witnesses.\r\n\r\n\"7. That in all criminal cases absolutely equal rights should be\r\naccorded the medical witnesses for both the prosecution and the defence\r\nfor the examination of the person alleged to be insane.\r\n\r\n\"8. That in our judgment the judiciary should by legal enactment be\r\nallowed more latitude in enlightening the jury and enabling it to\r\ncomprehend the nature and meaning of the medical testimony laid before\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"9. That we recommend as advisable the adoption wherever possible of\r\nthe so-called Leed's method of preliminary consultation by medical\r\nwitnesses on both sides of the case as to its status.\r\n\r\n\"10. That we advocate a freer use of appointments of commissions by the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n\"11. That a period of hospital observation of all persons committing\r\ncrimes in whose defence the plea of insanity has been raised is by\r\nfar the best method yet devised for securing impartial and accurate\r\nopinions, silencing popular clamor, avoiding prolonged and sensational\r\ntrials and saving expense to the State; also that we advocate the\r\nenactment in every State of laws similar to those of Maine, New\r\nHampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts, providing that such persons may\r\nbe committed by the court to a State hospital for the insane there to\r\nremain for such time as the court may direct pending the determination\r\nof their insanity.\r\n\r\n\"12. That it is the sense of the Association that it is subversive of\r\nthe dignity of the medical profession for any of its members to occupy\r\nthe position of medical advisory counsel in open court and at the same\r\ntime to act as expert witness in a medico-legal case.\r\n\r\n\"13. That we regard the acceptance by a physician of a fee that\r\nis contingent upon the result of a medico-legal case as not in\r\naccordance with medical ethics and derogatory to the good repute of the\r\nprofession, and advocate the regulation of the practice by legislation.\r\n\r\n\"14. That we are in favor of any legislation that will secure a\r\ndefinite standard of qualification for medical men giving expert\r\ntestimony.\"\r\n\r\nAn equal amount of consideration has been given to this important\r\nquestion from time to time by the American Institute of Criminal Law\r\nand Criminology. At a recent meeting of that organization the following\r\nrecommendations were submitted by a committee:\r\n\r\n\"1. That in all cases of felony or misdemeanor punishable by a prison\r\nsentence the question of responsibility be not submitted to the jury,\r\nwhich will thus be called upon to determine only that the offense was\r\ncommitted by the defendant.\r\n\r\n\"2. That the disposition and treatment (including punishment) of all\r\nsuch misdemeanants and felons, i.e., the sentence imposed, be based\r\nupon a study of the individual offender by properly qualified and\r\nimpartial experts cooperating with the courts.\r\n\r\n\"3. That provisions be made permitting the transfer of such\r\nmisdemeanants and felons at any time after conviction from one\r\ninstitution to another affording a different kind of treatment upon the\r\npresentation of evidence of the needs for such action satisfactory to\r\nthe court which passed sentence.\r\n\r\n\"4. That no maximum term be set to any sentence.\r\n\r\n\"5. That no parole or probation be granted without suitable psychiatric\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\n\"6. That in considering applications for pardons and commutation\r\ncareful attention be given to reports of qualified experts showing\r\nthe applicant's mental age and mental stability and that in drafting\r\nstatutes determining or defining juvenile delinquency, mental age\r\nand mental stability, within reasonable limits, be regarded as of\r\nimportance with the calendar age of the delinquent.\r\n\r\n\"In view of the foregoing and as an initial step towards the ends\r\nstated, the committee submits the following resolution and urges its\r\nimmediate adoption:\r\n\r\n\"Resolved, That the several states be urged to make provision for\r\nthe psychiatric examination, under conditions permitting prolonged\r\nobservation when necessary, of all persons convicted of a felony,\r\nmisdemeanor or other offense by properly qualified experts appointed\r\nto assist the court in reaching a decision as to the proper disposition\r\nand treatment of the offender.\"\r\n\r\nThe courts, the medical profession and the public have shown\r\nindications of a decided dissatisfaction with existing methods of\r\ndetermining criminal responsibility. This will certainly continue\r\nas long as the sole test of competency is the power of the accused\r\nto discriminate between a knowledge of right and wrong at the time\r\nwhen the act is committed. The conditions which lead to crime have\r\nbeen made the subject of scientific study by many. One of the early\r\ninvestigators in this field was Morel, who saw in the criminal a\r\npersonification \"of the various degenerations of the species.\" Much has\r\nbeen said of \"moral insanity,\" a condition referred to by Abercromby\r\nas one \"in which all the upright sentiments are eliminated while the\r\nintelligence presents no disorders.\" Lombroso advanced the theory\r\nthat criminality is a form of atavism—a reversion of man to the\r\nprimitive and savage type represented by his early ancestors. This\r\ntheory was based on a careful study of the anatomical, physiological\r\nand psychological characteristics of primitive man. His classification\r\nincluded the occasional, the emotional, the born criminal, the moral\r\ninsane, and the masked epileptic. Marro offered an anatomical basis\r\nfor the degenerative theory in the form of nutritional defects in the\r\ncentral nervous system. Ferri distinguished between criminal lunatics\r\nand emotional criminals and held crime to be \"a phenomenon of complex\r\norigin and the result of biological, physical and social conditions.\"\r\n\"Habitual criminals,\" he says, \"are the victims of a clear, evident\r\nand common mental alienation which causes the criminal activity,\"\r\nwhile the occasional offenders are to be explained by \"the impulse\r\nof opportunities more than the innate tendency that determines the\r\ncrime.\" The emotional criminal, according to Ferri, is a sane and\r\nmoral individual overcome by momentary emotional paroxysms referred\r\nto as a \"psychologic storm.\" Garofalo, on the other hand, looked upon\r\ncrime as \"an offense against the fundamental altruistic sentiments\r\nof pity and probity.\" From his point of view a criminal act was an\r\nindication of the loss of a proper sense of appreciation of the\r\nlife or property of another—a moral anomaly. The Italian school of\r\ncriminology was responsible also for the theory that criminal acts are\r\nonly the expression of epileptic symptoms. Sociological workers have\r\nattributed crime to influences which overcome the natural resistance\r\nof the individual, a variation from which is merely an inability of\r\nthe person to conform to the laws of environment. Max Nordau sees\r\nin human failings only an abnormality which he describes as \"human\r\nparasitism.\" Others look upon crime as the natural product of a modern\r\nsocial and economic system. Colajanni ascribes alcoholism, vagrancy\r\nand prostitution to poverty, but crime, he says, is \"due to necessity\r\nand to the degree and kind of education received.\" In the light of our\r\npresent knowledge the conclusion would appear to be warranted that\r\ncrime is the result of constitutional defects in the form of hereditary\r\ntendencies and arrested mental development, educational defects, a\r\ndeterioration of habits as shown by alcoholism, etc., accidental\r\ninfluences such as environment and poverty, pathological conditions,\r\nincluding epilepsy and insanity, and precipitating factors in the form\r\nof emotional disturbances.\r\n\r\nCriminality, alcoholism, poverty, prostitution and mental deficiency\r\nare closely correlated. A special committee appointed by the New York\r\nState Prison Commission has made an exceedingly interesting report[82]\r\non the relation existing between mental disease and crime. Their\r\ninvestigation shows that 21.8 per cent of 608 cases at Sing Sing,\r\nthirty-five per cent of 459 men at Auburn, twenty-two per cent of three\r\nhundred men at the Massachusetts State Prison, twenty-eight per cent of\r\nforty-nine women at Joliet, twenty-five per cent of seventy-six women\r\nat Auburn, twenty-three per cent of one hundred cases at the Indiana\r\nState Prison and thirty per cent of 150 examined at San Quentin were\r\nfound to be mentally defective. An average of 27.5 per cent has been\r\nfound in the prison population as a whole. Thirty-one and four-tenths\r\nper cent of the inmates of reformatories, training schools, workhouses\r\nand penitentiaries were found to be feebleminded. From twenty-seven\r\nto twenty-nine per cent of the inmates of penal and correctional\r\ninstitutions of the country were said to be defective. About thirty\r\nper cent of the population of the penal institutions for women in New\r\nYork were found to be feebleminded. A study of 502 selected cases at\r\nthe Psychopathic Laboratory of the Police Department of New York City\r\nin 1917 showed that fifty-eight per cent were suffering from either\r\nnervous or mental abnormalities. Of one thousand offenders examined\r\nby the medical service of the Boston Municipal Court twenty-three per\r\ncent were feebleminded, 10.4 per cent, psychopathic, 3.17 per cent,\r\nepileptic and nine per cent, mentally diseased and deteriorated;\r\n45.6 per cent in all showed abnormal mental conditions. It has been\r\nshown that one of the most important causes of recidivism is mental\r\ndeficiency. The importance of this observation may be illustrated by\r\nthe fact that of 133,047 persons admitted to the penal and correctional\r\ninstitutions of New York state sixty per cent had served previous\r\nterms. Of 25,820 persons received at institutions in Massachusetts\r\nduring one year, 57.4 per cent were recidivits. Justice Roads is\r\nresponsible for the statement that of 180,000 convictions in England in\r\none year more than ten thousand represented persons convicted upwards\r\nof twenty times previously.\r\n\r\nThe mental condition of the cases committed to the Matteawan State\r\nHospital is of great importance in a consideration of the relation\r\nof crime to the psychoses. Of 2,595 cases admitted between 1875\r\nand 1907 heredity or congenital defects were shown as etiological\r\nfactors in eight per cent of the total number. Of 793 admissions\r\nin which more definite and reliable information was available,\r\nhereditary factors were noted in either the paternal or maternal\r\nbranches of the family or both in thirty-five per cent of the cases.\r\nIn addition to this, heredity was found in collateral branches in\r\nsixteen per cent. Heredity of some kind was thus shown in 51.3 per\r\ncent of the whole number studied. Of 3,247 admissions, 46.9 per\r\ncent were noted as being intemperate in their habits. An analysis\r\nof 576 unconvicted cases in 1912[83] showed that 41.4 per cent were\r\ndiagnosed as dementia praecox, 21.1 per cent as alcoholic psychoses,\r\n6.9 per cent as paranoid conditions, 4.1 per cent as epileptic\r\npsychoses, 7.1 per cent as imbecility with excitements, 2.9 per cent\r\nas manic-depressive psychoses, 2.4 per cent as general paresis,\r\n3.1 per cent as undifferentiated depressions, 6.7 per cent as\r\nconstitutional inferiority and 2.2 per cent as not insane. An analysis\r\nof 925 cases committed as insane and charged with criminal offenses\r\nattributable to their mental condition shows the more common crimes\r\nas follows:—assault (all forms), 26.2 per cent, burglary, 7.8, grand\r\nlarceny, 8.2, petit larceny, 1, manslaughter, 1.4, murder, 18.9,\r\nhomicide (total), 22.4, rape, 3.2, and vagrancy, 4.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nNolan[84] has made an analysis of 646 first admissions to Matteawan\r\nduring a period of six years (1912 to 1918). Forty-eight per cent of\r\nthese were found to have been born in foreign countries. A striking\r\nobservation was the large proportion of male cases born in Italy (10.8\r\nper cent) and the female cases born in Ireland (11.7 per cent). Of\r\nthe various races represented it was noted that the African, which\r\nwas only responsible for 3.9 per cent of the admissions to civil\r\nhospitals, constituted 7.4 per cent of the Matteawan admissions. The\r\nraces having the largest representation were the Irish (18.7 per cent),\r\nthe Italian (12.4 per cent) and the Hebrew (10.8 per cent). The mixed\r\nraces constituted 11.3 per cent of the admissions as compared with\r\ntwenty-three per cent of the cases reported from civil institutions.\r\nAmong the male cases 11.4 per cent were charged with disorderly conduct\r\nand 26.47 per cent with vagrancy. Of the women, eighteen per cent were\r\ncharged with disorderly conduct, 16.4 with public intoxication and 39.8\r\nper cent with vagrancy and prostitution. These three groups represent\r\n74.2 per cent of all of the female cases admitted. Of the 646 criminal\r\nacts causing commitment, 34.1 per cent were classified from a legal\r\npoint of view as felonies and 65.9 per cent as misdemeanors. Only 5.3\r\nper cent were charged with murder, manslaughter, etc. Of the various\r\npsychoses represented by these cases 26.9 per cent were diagnosed as\r\ndementia praecox, seventeen per cent as alcoholic psychoses, 14.7\r\nper cent as constitutional psychopathic inferiority, 7.3 as mental\r\ndeficiency, 8.3 as manic-depressive psychoses, 11.3 as general paresis,\r\n3.6 as senile psychoses, 2.0 as paranoia or paranoid conditions, 2.2\r\nas epileptic psychoses, and 1.4 per cent as not insane. The alcoholic,\r\nconstitutionally inferior and mentally defective group constituted\r\nthirty-eight per cent of the total. Of the 165 cases diagnosed as\r\ndementia praecox it is interesting to note that eleven were charged\r\nwith homicide, ten with assault in the first degree, fifteen with\r\nburglary, thirteen with petit larceny, fourteen with disorderly\r\nconduct, and sixty-six with vagrancy or prostitution. Of the\r\nseventy-four cases of general paresis thirteen were charged with petit\r\nlarceny, eleven with disorderly conduct, and twenty-nine with vagrancy\r\nor prostitution. The homicides and assaults were committed principally\r\nby the alcoholic, dementia praecox, constitutionally inferior and the\r\ndefective cases. The burglaries and larcenies were committed largely by\r\npatients diagnosed as suffering from general paresis, dementia praecox\r\nand constitutional psychopathic inferiority.\r\n\r\nThe type of cases received at an institution exclusively for insane\r\nconvicts is naturally quite different, as shown by the admissions to\r\nthe Dannemora State Hospital in New York. Of 185 admissions covering a\r\nperiod of three years the principal psychoses represented were dementia\r\npraecox, forty-one per cent, constitutional psychopathic inferiority,\r\nnineteen per cent, manic-depressive psychoses, eight, mental\r\ndeficiency, nine, alcoholic psychoses, five, paranoid conditions, four\r\nper cent, etc.\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the defective criminal classes are not\r\nsuitable cases for either penal institutions or hospitals for the\r\ninsane. They are unable to adapt themselves to prison discipline\r\nor hospital routine and prefer to associate only with persons of\r\ntheir own kind who are given to foolish boasting of their crimes as\r\ntheir least harmful diversion. They are entirely unappreciative of\r\nany efforts made on their behalf to improve their condition or fit\r\nthem in any way for the requirements of society. They are strongly\r\ninclined to unprovoked cruelty to others. Often they manifest an\r\napparent interest in religious services, thinking it may lead to\r\nsome preferment, but not for any moral reason. They are notoriously\r\nuntruthful, unreliable and exhibit a low cunning which often deceives\r\nthose not familiar with handling individuals of that type. Curiously\r\nenough they are exceedingly critical of others and quick to notice\r\ntheir shortcomings. Sexual perversions and immoral conduct are only\r\ntoo common. Prostitution, as has already been shown, is one of the\r\nmost common failings of the female delinquent. An interesting but\r\nsuperficial knowledge of legal matters is noted very frequently and\r\nparaded with a remarkable degree of egotism which is difficult to\r\nunderstand. It is comparatively an infrequent occurrence for a prisoner\r\nto admit that he is guilty of the crime of which he has already been\r\nconvicted by a court. Only a few years since, a prisoner at Sing\r\nSing wrote the Governor of New York suggesting that his release was\r\nindicated as a moral procedure for the good of the institution, as\r\nhe was convinced from information obtained from others that he was\r\nthe only guilty man in the establishment. The habitual criminal takes\r\nlittle, if any, interest in his own relatives or family except when\r\nhe is in confinement, and feels no home ties. There is a curious lack\r\nof appreciation for the gravity of his own offense and he always\r\ncomplains of a \"frame up\" and asserts that he has not had a square\r\ndeal. Homicides even are always explained in an attempt to show that\r\nthey were justifiable or unavoidable. The most vicious of assaults\r\nare often committed on their fellow prisoners without any provocation\r\nof consequence. Experience shows that as a rule they are incapable of\r\nany sustained effort and accomplish little or nothing when left to\r\nthemselves. Tendencies to crime show not only a marked suggestibility\r\nbut a degree of impulsiveness and a lack of self control which is\r\nhighly significant.\r\n\r\nAnother type of institution for this special group of cases is strongly\r\nindicated. They should be held under an indeterminate sentence and in\r\nsome instances committed for life. As a result of hereditary defects,\r\narrested mental development, ignorance and vicious tendencies this\r\nclass furnishes the prisons with our most dangerous criminals. They\r\nshould receive separate care, with an opportunity for a special\r\neducation adapted to their individual needs. The defective classes\r\nhave for centuries been held criminally responsible and have filled our\r\nprisons with incorrigibles and recidivists. Modern civilization should\r\nplace at our disposal some means for remedying this situation other\r\nthan mere punishment for the possession of an intellectual endowment\r\nfor which these individuals are in no way responsible. The ends of\r\njustice can be served and the protection of the public assured at the\r\nsame time by a form of medical treatment for the defective delinquent\r\nwhich will look forward to his ultimate restoration to society rather\r\nthan a form of punishment which accomplishes nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHIATRY OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe psychiatry of the late war is of unusual interest from various\r\npoints of view. Never before have mental diseases or defects been\r\nlooked upon as military problems worthy of any special attention either\r\nin times of war or peace. It is true that the United States government\r\nhas maintained a hospital for the treatment of such conditions at\r\nWashington for many years, and medical officers from the army and navy\r\nhave been sent to that institution for instruction, from time to time.\r\nNo adequate provision has been made, however, in previous wars for\r\nthe special care or observation of the psychoses or neuroses, nor has\r\nany great consideration been given to a determination of the mental\r\nstatus of recruits. It is, of course, equally true that modern military\r\nmethods have brought about different conditions and given rise to new\r\nproblems. In 1917 and 1918 definite psychiatric organizations were\r\nestablished by the United States army for the first time. The services\r\nof specialists in mental diseases were utilized extensively and they\r\nwere ultimately assigned to practically all of the large hospitals.\r\nDivision consultants were soon found necessary and the active\r\ncooperation of practically every psychiatrist available in the country\r\nwas required before the armistice was declared.\r\n\r\nThis was directly due to the fact that for the first time in history\r\none of the most important problems, with which the military authorities\r\nhad to deal, was the question of mental diseases and defects. For\r\npurposes of comparison and the intelligent consideration of this\r\nimportant subject, the incidence of mental diseases in the army in\r\nthe past is of considerable interest. The rate in enlisted men, as\r\nshown by the Surgeon General's reports, varied from 1.08 per thousand\r\nin 1898 to 1.73 in 1911, and was 2.72 in 1900, the only year in which\r\nit went above two. In 1912, 1913, 1914 and 1915, when defective mental\r\ndevelopment, constitutional psychopathic states, hypochondriasis and\r\nnostalgia were included in the reports the rates per thousand were\r\nrespectively 3.45, 3.44, 4.18 and 3.82. The frequency of psychoses was\r\nhigher in the men serving in the Philippines—2.07 in 1898, 2.79 in\r\n1900, 1.45 in 1905 and 2.01 in 1911.\r\n\r\nThe ratio of mental diseases in the American and English armies has\r\nbeen higher for many years than in the French, Italian, Russian and\r\nGerman forces. Universal military service is supposed to have been the\r\nfactor producing this difference, the larger establishments naturally\r\nmore nearly representing the normal insanity rate of the country.\r\nFrom May 1, 1861, to June 30, 1866, in other words, during the civil\r\nwar period, there were 198,849 discharges for disability from the\r\nUnited States army.[85] Of this number 819 men were discharged on\r\naccount of insanity, 3,872 for epilepsy and 2,838 for various forms\r\nof \"paralysis.\" Based on the mean annual strength of the army, this\r\nrepresented a rate of .34 per thousand for insanity, 1.6 for epilepsy\r\nand 1.17 for paralysis. Based on the total number of discharges alone,\r\nit represented a rate of 6.0 per thousand for insanity, 20.8 for\r\nparalysis, and 28.3 for epilepsy or a rate for the three combined of\r\n55.1 per thousand. These statistics are for white soldiers only. The\r\nrate for colored troops, based on the total discharges, was seven per\r\nthousand for insanity, 14.3 for paralysis and thirty-six for epilepsy.\r\nNo information whatever is available as to what the term paralysis\r\nincludes in these reports. The rate per thousand in the United States\r\narmy, as has been shown, increased from approximately one in 1898 to\r\nthree in 1901, during the Spanish war, Philippine insurrection, etc.,\r\nand dropped back to one again in 1903. Weygandt,[86] who made a study\r\nof war neuroses and psychoses in 1904, gives the insanity rate per\r\nthousand of the German army during the Franco-Prussian war as .54, the\r\nAmerican troops during the Spanish war as 2.7, the British army during\r\nthe Boer war as 2.6, the Russian army during the Japanese war as 2.0,\r\nand the Bulgarian troops during the Balkan campaign .33. The German\r\nexpeditionary corps engaged in Southwestern Africa reported 4.95 per\r\nthousand and a rate of 8.28 including epilepsy and hysteria.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt ever made to provide special care for mental diseases\r\nin the field was during the Russo-Japanese war. A hospital set aside\r\nfor this purpose by the Russian army at Harbin treated between fifteen\r\nhundred and two thousand men in 1905 and 1906. It has, however, never\r\nbeen claimed that all of the mental cases reached that place. Of 1,310\r\nadmissions the following conditions were represented[87]:—epileptic\r\npsychoses, 22.5 per cent; alcoholic forms, 19.5 per cent; dementia\r\npraecox, ten per cent; confused states, nine per cent; hysterical\r\npsychoses, 7.7 per cent; general paresis, 5.6 per cent; toxic\r\nconditions, 4.8 per cent; manic-depressive psychoses, four per cent;\r\ndegenerative types, 3.5 per cent; traumatic psychoses, 3.2 per cent;\r\nand organic brain diseases, 2.9 per cent. It is interesting to note\r\nthat Steida, who analyzed the statistics of the Russo-Japanese war in\r\n1906, reached the conclusion that a psychic trauma alone was not a\r\nsufficient cause for the development of a neurosis. He attached an\r\nequal importance to prolonged physical exertion, deprivation, loss of\r\nsleep, hunger and thirst, etc. The most common disturbances following\r\nbattles were found to be hysterical excitements and confused states.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the examination of men for military service was undertaken\r\nin this country in 1917 it became apparent that one of the most\r\nfrequent causes of rejection was either mental disease or deficiency.\r\nThe second report of the Provost Marshal General to the Secretary of\r\nWar in 1919[88] showed that of all rejections during the first year of\r\nmobilization, twenty-two per cent were due to physical defects which\r\nwould interfere with duty (defects in bones, and joints, flat foot,\r\nhernia, etc.), fifteen per cent were on account of imperfections of the\r\nsense organs, thirteen per cent were for defects in the cardiovascular\r\nsystem and about twelve per cent were due to nervous or mental\r\ndiseases. The inspection at camps following the physical examination\r\nof the first million men mobilized resulted in a rejection of nine\r\nper cent on account of nervous or mental diseases. Of all causes\r\nfor rejections from the army up to February 1, 1919, according to\r\nBailey,[89] mental and nervous diseases ranked fourth numerically. The\r\n\"neuropsychiatric\" causes were:—psychoses, eleven per cent; neuroses,\r\nfifteen per cent; epilepsy, nine per cent; organic nervous diseases or\r\ninjuries, eighteen per cent; mental defects, thirty-two per cent, and\r\nconstitutional psychopathic states, nine per cent; a total of 67,417\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIn the organization of our military forces in 1917, when this country\r\nentered the war, every effort was made to take advantage of the\r\nexperience of others. Of the men returned to Canada from European\r\nbattlefields on account of disability, the nervous and mental cases\r\ncontributed ten per cent of the total at that time, as was shown by\r\nFarrar.[90] These were distributed as follows:—neurotic reactions,\r\nfifty-eight per cent; mental disease and defect, sixteen per cent; head\r\ninjuries, fourteen per cent; epilepsy and epileptoid conditions, eight\r\nper cent; and organic diseases of the central nervous system, four per\r\ncent. The first group mentioned consisted of neuroses in general and\r\nincluded the so-called cases of \"shell shock,\" which brings us to one\r\nof the most interesting problems of the war. Dean A. Worcester, in a\r\nrecent letter to the editor of _Science_, has raised the question as\r\nto whether this is a new disease. He calls attention to the following\r\nreference by Herodotus to the Battle of Marathon which occurred in the\r\nyear 490 B.C.:—\"The following prodigy occurred there: An Athenian,\r\nEpizelius, son of Capliagoras, while fighting in the medley, and\r\nbehaving valiantly, was deprived of sight, though wounded in no part of\r\nhis body, nor struck from a distance; and he continued to be blind from\r\nthat time for the remainder of his life. I have heard that he used to\r\ngive the following account of his loss. He thought that a large, heavy\r\narmed man stood before him, whose beard shaded the whole of his shield;\r\nthat this specter passed by him, and killed the man that stood by his\r\nside. Such is the account I have been informed Epizelius used to give.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature and cause of shell shock has been the subject of much\r\ncontroversy. In 1875 Ericksen called attention to the effect of intense\r\nemotional shock on the nervous system. This he explained as \"dependent\r\non molecular changes in the cord itself.\" Oppenheim's monograph in 1899\r\nwas responsible for the general use of the term \"traumatic neurosis.\"\r\nHis conception of these conditions was not accepted by Charcot, who\r\nat the time insisted that they belonged to the domain of hysteria,\r\nand were due solely to psychic traumas. Oppenheim's[91] observation\r\nof cases during the first year of the war confirmed his previous\r\nviews. He expressed the opinion in 1915 that \"in absolutely healthy\r\nand mentally normal individuals, without any trace of hereditary\r\ntaint, war trauma may cause psychoses or neuroses. The causal injury\r\nmay be of an objective, psychic or mixed nature. Violent detonations\r\nillustrate the mixed type. Their effect upon the nerve of hearing\r\nis certainly physical, but the psychic effect—terror—is also an\r\nimportant element in the resulting condition. The enormous air\r\npressure exerted by the close passage of these missiles is another\r\ninfluential factor. An element that tends to complicate etiology is\r\nthe frequent long duration of the exciting causes (prolonged and\r\ncontinuous artillery fire, a series of injuries received at brief\r\nintervals, exhaustion from various causes, lack of sleep, insufficient\r\nnourishment, extreme heat or cold, etc.).\" He admits that the symptoms\r\nindicate a combination of neurasthenic and hysterical complexes which\r\nmay be explained on a psychogenic basis, but maintains that the war\r\nhas demonstrated them to be of a different nature. An external shock\r\ncauses \"a functional disturbance of the delicate mechanism of the\r\npsychic centers shown in 1, faulty distribution of motor impulses, 2,\r\nhypo-innervation, 3, hyper-innervation, causing tremors, tonic and\r\nclonic spasms, etc., instead of single muscle actions.\" He admits that\r\na hysterical temperament may be an important factor. Max Nonne[92] in\r\n1915 called attention to the fact that conditions combining symptoms\r\nof hysteria, neurasthenia and hypochondriasis plus vasomotor changes\r\nmay occur without any history of injury and should not be called\r\ntraumatic neuroses for that reason. He felt that the sudden recoveries\r\noccurring so frequently strongly discredited any theories suggesting\r\nan anatomical basis. He expressed the opinion that the most common\r\ncause was the explosion of hand grenades and that the main factor\r\ninvolved was an emotional disturbance. Binswanger[93] was of the\r\nopinion that mechanical injuries to the nervous system were responsible\r\nfor the clinical pictures in war hysterias. He found that in a few\r\ncases only was there a history of predisposition, and maintained\r\nthat in pre-war conditions hysteria was the result of a combination\r\nof psychic traumas with physical disturbances. Exciting causes were\r\n\"over-exertion, irregular and insufficient nutrition, loss of sleep\r\nand high mental tension.\" He concludes that \"The theory of a psychic\r\nmechanism as the origin of these motor and sensory symptoms is not\r\ndemonstrable.\" \"War neurology has demonstrated that emotional shock, in\r\nconjunction with other injuries, may cause a symptom complex identical\r\nin all its details with the well known clinical picture of hysteria.\"\r\nWolfsohn,[94] from a study of one hundred psychoneuroses and one\r\nhundred cases of physical injury received on the firing line, reached\r\nthe conclusion that war neuroses are very rarely associated with\r\nexternal wounds. The vast majority of cases studied had a neuropathic\r\nor psychopathic taint, as shown in the family history in fourteen\r\nper cent of the total. A previous neuropathic constitution in the\r\npatient was found in seventy-two per cent. \"A gradual psychic shock\r\nfrom long-continued fear, together with the sudden change from quiet,\r\npeaceful environment to the extraordinary stress and strain of trench\r\nfighting, is the chief predisposing cause of war psychoneurosis in\r\nsoldiers with neuropathic predisposition.... Wounded soldiers do not\r\nsuffer from war neuroses except in rare instances.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the United States entered the war, Major, afterwards Colonel,\r\nThomas W. Salmon[95] of the United States army made an exhaustive\r\nstudy of \"The Care and Treatment of Mental Diseases and War Neuroses\r\n(\"Shell Shock\") in the British Army.\" At that time one-seventh of\r\nall discharges for disability from the British forces were due to\r\nmental and nervous disorders. As a matter of fact, they accounted for\r\none-third of all discharges for actual diseases (eliminating wounds).\r\nEngland with the advantage of three years of experience had presumably\r\ncompleted her organization to its highest efficiency. One and one-tenth\r\nper cent of the cases in the military hospitals were suffering from\r\nmental diseases. The percentage represented by the expeditionary forces\r\nwas 1.3. About six thousand \"shell shock\" cases were being admitted\r\nannually to the English hospitals. Col. Salmon estimated the admission\r\nrate at two per thousand in the troops at home and four per thousand\r\nin the expeditionary forces. The civilian rate during the same period\r\nwas about one to one thousand of the population. The confusion which\r\nexisted early in the war was shown by the fact that ten per cent\r\nof the cases sent to the Red Cross Military Hospital at Maghull as\r\nwar neuroses turned out to be insane and twenty per cent of those\r\nadmitted as mental cases at the Royal Victoria Hospital at Netley were\r\nsubsequently found to be suffering from neuroses. The first conclusion\r\nreached by Col. Salmon was that \"contrary to popular belief and to some\r\nmedical reports published early in the war, no new clinical types of\r\nmental disease have been seen in soldiers. There are no war psychoses.\"\r\nHe found that of the cases being admitted to the hospitals for mental\r\ndiseases about eighteen per cent were mental defectives, two per cent\r\nsyphilitic psychoses, twenty per cent manic-depressive insanity,\r\nfourteen per cent dementia praecox, and seven per cent epilepsy.\r\nStatistics at that time were not available on purely psychopathic\r\nconditions, owing to the classification used.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the etiology of shell shock Col. Salmon divides those\r\nconditions into four groups—1. Cases in which death is caused by\r\nexploding shells or mines without external signs of injury; 2. Those\r\nin which severe neurological symptoms follow burial or concussion by\r\nexplosions, with characteristic syndromes suggesting the operation\r\nof mechanical factors; 3. Cases in which there may or may not be\r\ndamage to the central nervous system, but showing neuroses similar\r\nto those of civil life—\"In this group of cases, in which there is\r\npossibility but no proof of damage to the central nervous system, the\r\nsymptoms present which might be attributable to such damage are quite\r\novershadowed by those characteristic of the neuroses;\" and 4. Cases in\r\nwhich even the slightest damage to the central nervous system from the\r\ndirect effect of explosions is exceedingly improbable. He also found\r\nthat hundreds of men who have not been exposed to battle conditions\r\nat all develop symptoms almost identical with those described as\r\n\"shell shock,\" many occurring in the non-expeditionary forces. The\r\npsychogenic factors involved are very well summarized by Col. Salmon\r\nin the following words:—\"The psychological basis of the war neuroses\r\n(like that of the neuroses in civil life) is an elaboration, with\r\nendless variations, of one central theme: escape from an intolerable\r\nsituation in real life to one made tolerable by the neurosis. The\r\nconditions which may make intolerable the situation in which a soldier\r\nfinds himself hardly need stating. Not only fear, which exists at some\r\ntime in nearly all soldiers and in many is constantly present, but\r\nhorror, revulsion against the ghastly duties which must be sometimes\r\nperformed, intense longing for home, particularly in married men,\r\nemotional situations resulting from the interplay of personal conflicts\r\nand military conditions, all play their part in making an escape of\r\nsome sort mandatory. Death provides a means which cannot be sought\r\nconsciously. Flight or desertion is rendered impossible by ideals of\r\nduty, patriotism and honor, by the reactions acquired by training or\r\nimposed by discipline and by herd reactions. Malingering is a military\r\ncrime and is not at the disposal of those governed by higher ethical\r\nconceptions. Nevertheless, the conflict between a simple and direct\r\nexpression in flight of the instinct of self-preservation and such\r\nfactors demands some sort of compromise. Wounds solve the problem most\r\nhappily for many men and the mild exhilaration so often seen among\r\nthe wounded has a sound psychological basis. Others with a sufficient\r\nadaptability find a means of adjustment. The neurosis provides a means\r\nof escape so convenient that the real source of wonder is not that it\r\nshould play such an important part in military life but that so many\r\nmen should find a satisfactory adjustment without its intervention. The\r\nconstitutionally neurotic, having most readily at their disposal the\r\nmechanism of functional nervous diseases, employ it most frequently.\r\nThey constitute, therefore, a large proportion of all cases but\r\na very striking fact in the present war is the number of men of\r\napparently normal make-up who develop war neuroses in the face of the\r\nunprecedentedly terrible conditions to which they are exposed.\"\r\n\r\nThe symptomatology has been briefly summarized by Col. Salmon in a way\r\nwhich cannot be improved upon:—\"Most of them can be summed up in the\r\nstatement that the soldier loses a function that either is necessary\r\nto continued military service or prevents his successful adaptation to\r\nwar. The symptoms are found in widely separated fields. Disturbances of\r\npsychic functions include delirium, confusion, amnesia, hallucinations,\r\nterrifying battle dreams, anxiety states. The disturbances of\r\ninvoluntary functions include functional heart disorders, low blood\r\npressure, vomiting and diarrhea, enuresis, retention or polyuria,\r\ndyspnoea, sweating. Disturbances of voluntary muscular functions\r\ninclude paralyses, tics, tremors, gait disturbances, contractures and\r\nconvulsive movements. Special senses may be affected producing pains\r\nand anesthesias, mutism, deafness, hyperacusis, blindness and disorders\r\nof speech. It is highly significant that, in this unprecedented\r\nprevalence of functional nervous diseases among soldiers, no symptoms\r\nunfamiliar to those who see the neuroses in civil life present\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the 170,000 cases discharged for disability in England\r\nshowed that twenty per cent were due to war neuroses. In his second\r\nLettsomian lecture Mott[96] called attention to the interesting\r\nsimilarity between shell shock following concussion and burial, and\r\nthe symptoms resulting from an acute carbon monoxide poisoning. This\r\nwas, of course, a very possible complication in trench warfare.\r\nThe headache, ringing in the ears, blurred and indistinct vision,\r\nhallucinations of sight, or actual blindness, giddiness, yawning,\r\nweariness, vomiting, cold sensations, palpitation, sense of oppression\r\non the chest, etc., so common in gas poisoning are often followed,\r\nwhen consciousness is regained, by confusion and loss of memory, with\r\nretrograde amnesia. Tremors and loss of speech are also frequently\r\nnoted. Mott reached the conclusion that shell shock, in some cases\r\nat least, was due to gas poisoning. In his third Lettsomian lecture\r\nhe discusses the symptomatology of shell shock. In some instances\r\nthere was a partial loss of consciousness, characterized by dazed\r\nstates somewhat similar to those of epilepsy. Under speech defects he\r\nincludes mutism, aphonia, stammering, stuttering and verbal repetition.\r\nHeadache in the occipital region was found to be a very common symptom.\r\nVasomotor conditions were palpitation, breathlessness, pericardial\r\npain, rapid weak pulse, low blood pressure, cold extremities, low\r\ntemperature, etc. Anesthesia and hyperesthesia or loss of pain\r\nsense also occurred, and deafness was often observed. Smoky vision,\r\nphotophobia and functional blindness were frequent eye symptoms.\r\nTremors, tics, choreiform movements, functional paralysis and gait\r\ndisturbances are also mentioned by Mott. In the Chadwick lecture he\r\nlater called attention to the presence of insomnia and terrifying\r\ndreams in practically all cases of true shell shock.\r\n\r\nIn 1917 Mott[97] reported the examination of the brains from two\r\ncases of pure shell shock. They showed a congestion of the meninges,\r\nscattered subpial hemorrhages, and congested vessels in the internal\r\ncapsule, pons and medulla. In one case there was an extravasation of\r\nblood into the substance of the lower surface of the orbital lobe. He\r\nspoke also of a general chromatolysis in the ganglion cells. Eder[98]\r\nin 1917 advanced the theory that the symptoms of neuroses are the\r\nresult of mental conflicts and that the mechanisms involved are those\r\nattributed by Freud to hysteria. As a result of an analysis of one\r\nhundred cases he reached the conclusion that mechanical shock, gas\r\npoisoning and other physical traumas were not factors in the production\r\nof these conditions. His cases occurred in persons free from hereditary\r\nor personal psychoneurotic predisposition. Chavigny in a discussion\r\nof the mental diseases in the French army asserted that psychoses and\r\nneuroses were practically unknown until trench warfare began and the\r\nuse of heavy artillery became common. From this moment psychiatric\r\nunits became necessities. Ballet and de Fursac[99] were very firmly\r\nof the opinion that shell shock was due to purely emotional reactions\r\nin predisposed individuals. \"If disturbances from explosion and\r\nfrom emotional shock, existing with or without traumatism, produce\r\nidentical results, it is evident that they have a common factor and\r\nthis common factor can be only the emotion itself. Disturbance from\r\nexplosion without external injury presupposes an emotional state, and\r\nit is from this state that it derives its causal efficacy; whatever\r\nthe etiological complex found as the cause of a condition of shock,\r\nwhether the explosion of a shell, bomb or mine, the sight of the dead,\r\nburial in a trench, wound from an explosion or a missile, there is only\r\none factor of importance, the emotional factor, which is essentially\r\nresponsible for all the neuropsychic disorders that together make up\r\nthe shock syndrome.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1915 Birnbaum summarized seventy-two articles written on war\r\npsychoneuroses in the German army up to the middle of March of that\r\nyear. On analyzing this study Hoch reached the conclusion that the rate\r\nof psychoses was only about two in ten thousand, which would appear to\r\nbe entirely too low. Birnbaum compared the statistics of various\r\nobservers showing the frequency of psychoses during the first year of\r\nthe war as follows:—\"Psychopathic constitution, hysteria, traumatic\r\nneuroses, etc., Bonhöffer, fifty-four per cent; Meyer, 37.5 per\r\ncent; and Hahn forty-three per cent. Alcoholism, acute and chronic,\r\nBonhöffer, ten per cent; Meyer, 21.5 per cent; and Hahn, twenty-one\r\nper cent. Dementia praecox, Bonhöffer, seven per cent; Meyer, 7.5 per\r\ncent; and Hahn, thirteen per cent. Epilepsy, Bonhöffer, fourteen per\r\ncent; Meyer, 11.5 per cent; and Hahn, eight per cent. Manic-depressive\r\ninsanity, Bonhöffer, three per cent; Meyer, four per cent; and Hahn,\r\ntwo per cent. General paralysis, Bonhöffer, six per cent; Meyer, 3.5\r\nper cent; and Hahn, three per cent.\" In discussing these findings Hoch\r\nsays:—\"It is clear from this table that psychopathic constitutions,\r\nvarious psychogenic reactions, hysterical and anxiety states, also\r\nexhaustive conditions—all of which are included in the first\r\ngroup—are strikingly frequent; whereas the more serious constitutional\r\ndisorders, such as manic-depressive insanity, dementia praecox and\r\nepilepsy are much rarer.\" Both Birnbaum and Bonhöffer expressed\r\nsurprise at the infrequency of manic-depressive conditions. Wollenberg\r\nfound that the individuals who broke down during mobilization, and who\r\nhad the least resistance, developed manic-depressive insanity, paranoid\r\nschizophrenias, episodic psychopathic excitements and occasional\r\nclouded states. The cases appearing at the front, on the other hand,\r\nwere largely hysterias, anxiety states and exhaustive conditions.\r\nBirnbaum described psychoses similar to those reported by Awtokratow\r\nin the Russo-Japanese war and characterized by great weariness with\r\na tendency to weeping, disturbed sleep and hallucinations related\r\ndirectly to unpleasant war experiences to which the patients had been\r\nsubjected. He attributed these to exhaustion. Lust[100] quotes Mörchen\r\nas finding only five cases of war neuroses in forty thousand prisoners\r\nat Darmstadt and found very few cases in an additional twenty thousand\r\nwhich he investigated himself.\r\n\r\nWestphal in 1915 expressed the opinion that there were neither war\r\npsychoses nor neuroses and that these conditions did not differ in any\r\nway from those described in times of peace. MacCurdy,[101] who made\r\nan elaborate study of war neuroses in 1917, described them as being\r\neither anxiety conditions or simple conversion hysterias. He looked\r\nupon fatigue as being a very important factor in the development of\r\na neurosis, with either a physical accident or a mental shock as the\r\nprecipitating cause. He defines war neuroses as \"Those functional\r\nnervous conditions arising in soldiers which are immediately determined\r\nby modern warfare and have a symptomatology whose content is directly\r\nrelated to war.\" MacCurdy found that concussion could be considered as\r\na possible factor in less than one-fourth of the cases he observed.\r\nHe refers to minute cerebral and retinal hemorrhages with blood in\r\nthe cerebrospinal fluid as an evidence that concussion is a cause in\r\nsome cases. Curschmann, Meyers, Buzzard, Farrar and various others\r\nhave noticed that the gross hysterical manifestations were extremely\r\nrare in officers. After an extended discussion of the etiology of\r\nthe war neuroses, Farrar in 1918 expressed as one of his conclusions\r\nthe opinion that \"The drift of opinion is unmistakable towards the\r\npsychogenic basis of war neuroses of all types, including shell shock.\r\nEven in the initial unconsciousness or twilight state of some duration\r\nthere is evidence that the psychogenic element may have as great if\r\nnot a greater rôle than the item of mechanical shock, although this is\r\nalso important.\"\r\n\r\nHartung[102] in 1918 reported a study of 780 cases of war neuroses\r\ntreated by him at Thal. About ninety-eight per cent were cured by\r\npsychic and mechanical treatments. One hundred and sixty-two cases\r\nshowed hysterical paralysis, the lower limbs being affected twice as\r\noften as the upper. Tremors of the head or upper limbs were present\r\nin twenty-eight per cent, hysterical convulsions in eight per cent,\r\nspeech disturbances in five per cent, hearing disorders in one per\r\ncent, cardiac and respiratory symptoms in 1.5 per cent, neuroses of the\r\ndigestive system in 1.5 per cent, and bladder disturbances in 1.5 per\r\ncent of the cases. Neurasthenia \"in the strictest sense of the word\"\r\nwas present in twenty per cent. Hurst[103] and others have spoken of\r\nendocrine disturbances in war neuroses. He includes hyperadrenalism and\r\nhyperthyroidism due to an over-stimulation of the sympathetic nervous\r\nsystem, resulting from such emotions as anger and fear. Rapid pulse,\r\nenlargement of the heart, and high blood pressure were common symptoms.\r\nThe patients in some cases showed conditions strongly suggesting\r\nGraves' disease. In addition to the circulatory disturbances there was\r\nparoxysmal sweating, the eyes were slightly prominent, sometimes with\r\nvon Graefe's sign, and pilomotor reflexes were present.\r\n\r\nAn important contribution to the discussion as to the etiology of war\r\nneuroses was the statement made by Major General Ireland[104] to the\r\nSenate Committee on Military Affairs, that of the twenty-five hundred\r\ncases of shell shock awaiting transportation to the United States,\r\ntwenty-one hundred recovered within a day or two after the armistice\r\nwas declared. He gave the incidence of mental and nervous diseases\r\nin the forces in camps in this country as 2.5 per thousand and ten\r\nper thousand overseas. Another interesting phase of shell shock was\r\nthe surprising results which various German observers obtained by the\r\nso-called \"Kaufmann\" treatment, the sudden application of a strong\r\nfaradic current. One of the most significant contributions to the\r\npsychiatric history of the war as far as this country is concerned\r\nis the statement made by Col. Salmon[105] that in the latter part\r\nof December, 1920, of the beneficiaries of the War Risk Insurance\r\nthirty-two per cent were suffering from general diseases; forty-one\r\nper cent from tuberculosis; and twenty-seven per cent from various\r\nneuropsychiatric disorders. \"The vague idea that all these men are\r\nsuffering from \"shell shock\" or other mysterious maladies developed\r\nunder the stress of modern warfare was replaced by the realization\r\nthat more than two-thirds of all neuropsychiatric patients have one or\r\nanother type of insanity.\" Of these cases sixty-six per cent had well\r\ndeveloped psychoses; nineteen per cent psychoneuroses; five per cent\r\nepilepsy; two per cent mental deficiency; and eight per cent organic\r\nnervous diseases or injuries. On December 16, 1920, there were five\r\nthousand five hundred cases receiving hospital treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nENDOCRINOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important influence exercised by the glandular structures on the\r\nhuman organism has long been recognized. Perhaps the earliest evidence\r\nof this is the study of alterations due to the removal of the sexual\r\nglands. Eunuchoidism was described by Larrey as early as 1812 in\r\nhis well-known account of the Egyptian campaign. In 1845 Bouchardat\r\nadvanced the theory that pancreatic lesions were responsible for the\r\ndevelopment of diabetic disorders. Thomas Addison in 1855 showed the\r\nexistence of a very definite disease process caused by pathological\r\nconditions in the adrenals. Mongolianism was recognized as a distinct\r\nentity by Langdon-Down in 1866. Gigantism was studied very thoroughly\r\nby von Langer in 1872. The existence of the parathyroids was unknown\r\nuntil they were described by Sandström in 1880. Weiss in 1881 showed\r\nthat the extirpation of the thyroid sometimes caused tetany. After\r\nmyxedema had been studied clinically by Charcot and others the fact\r\nthat it was clearly related to disturbances of the functions of\r\nthe thyroid gland was demonstrated by Kocher and Reverdin in 1882.\r\nAdipositas Dolorosa was described by Dercum as a form of dysthyroidia\r\nin the same year. Acromegaly was originally defined by Pierre Marie\r\nin 1886 and its relation to the hypophysis was pointed out by him.\r\nIn 1886 Möbius called attention to the part played by the ductless\r\nglands in Basedow's disease, Grawitz in 1888 showed the significance\r\nof thymic hyperplasia and Paltauf in the following year described the\r\n\"lymphato-chlorotic constitution.\" The pancreatic origin of diabetes\r\nwas elaborately outlined by von Mering and Minkowski in 1889. The\r\ninfluence exerted by glandular secretions on general metabolism was\r\ndemonstrated by Brown-Sequard in the same year. Lemoine and Launois\r\nin 1891 reported the existence of sclerosis of the blood and lymph\r\nvessels in the pancreas and Laguerse in 1893 found that the Islands of\r\nLangerhans were often involved in diabetes. Thyroigenic obesity was\r\nreported by von Hertoghe in 1896. The isolation and chemical definition\r\nof adrenalin by Takamine in 1901 was a decided step in advance.\r\nFröhlich in 1901 suggested that obesity, infantilism of the genitalia\r\nand myxedematous alterations of the skin pointed to tumors of the\r\nhypophysis. In the same year Neumann thoroughly reviewed the subject\r\nof growths in the epiphysis, submitting a study of twenty-two cases.\r\nThe various types of dwarfism were first described by von Hansemann in\r\n1902. Thyroplasia and myxedema were exhaustively studied by Pineles\r\nin 1910 and 1912. The literature on the subject of the ductless or\r\nso-called endocrine glands has grown enormously during the last two or\r\nthree decades and is shown in full by Falta and Meyers.[106]\r\n\r\nThe endocrine syndromes as now understood have been briefly summarized\r\nby Blumgarten[107] in a very graphic form as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THYROID STIGMATA\r\n\r\n _Symptoms of So-called Hyperactivity_\r\n\r\n  Exophthalmus.\r\n  Wide palpebral slits.\r\n  Tachycardia.\r\n  Nervousness.\r\n  Tremors.\r\n  Stelwag's sign.\r\n  Scanty and frequent menstruation.\r\n  Emaciation.\r\n  Periodic loss of flesh and strength.\r\n  Mild hyperthermia.\r\n  Increased basal metabolism.\r\n  Lymphocytosis.\r\n  Von Graefe's sign.\r\n  Anginoid attacks.\r\n  Hyperidrosis.\r\n  Deformities of the nails.\r\n  Dryness of the mouth.\r\n  Excessive salivation.\r\n  Vomiting attacks.\r\n  Diarrhea.\r\n  Irregular breathing.\r\n  Eosinophilia.\r\n  Increased coagulation time.\r\n  Increased emotional irritability.\r\n  Ideas of reference and persecution.\r\n  Manic symptoms.\r\n  Bluish-white teeth.\r\n  High hair line.\r\n  Hourglass contraction of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Symptoms of So-called Hyposecretion_\r\n\r\n  Precocious graying of the hair.\r\n  Drowsiness.\r\n  Anorexia.\r\n  Small stature.\r\n  Puffiness of the face.\r\n  Sallow complexion.\r\n  Scanty hair.\r\n  Deepset eyeballs.\r\n  Dull and listless cornea.\r\n  Hard, brittle nails.\r\n  Scanty eyebrows.\r\n  Cold, bluish, moist hands.\r\n  Tending to chilblains.\r\n  Irregularly developed teeth which decay easily.\r\n  Defective development.\r\n  Dry, thick, scaly skin.\r\n  Acrocyanosis.\r\n  Localized transitory edema.\r\n  Urticaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Parathyroid Stigmata_\r\n\r\n  Intermittent cramps.\r\n  Twitching of the hands.\r\n  Tetany with associated symptoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Pituitary Stigmata_\r\n\r\n  Greatly thickened nose.\r\n  Prominence of superciliary ridges.\r\n  Tendency to increased tuftings of terminal phalanges.\r\n  Coarse, heavy, overhanging eyebrows.\r\n  Protruding thick lips.\r\n  Prominent hypertrophied lower jaw.\r\n  Increased sugar tolerance.\r\n  Increased interdental spaces.\r\n  Enlarged sella tursica.\r\n  Hypertrophied nails.\r\n  Hypertrophied, thickened skin.\r\n  Short, square hands.\r\n  High carbohydrate tolerance.\r\n  Amenorrhea.\r\n  Visceroptosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n _So-called Deficiency Symptoms_\r\n\r\n  Adiposity.\r\n  Fat pads around the malleoli.\r\n  Increased development of the mammary glands.\r\n  Deposit of fat around the buttocks and the neck.\r\n  Alabasterlike skin.\r\n  Irregular menstruation.\r\n  Subnormal temperature.\r\n  Wide intercostal angle.\r\n  Fatigability.\r\n  Infantile uterus.\r\n  Slow pulse.\r\n  Sluggish mentality.\r\n  Mononucleosis.\r\n  Eosinophilia.\r\n  Leucocytosis.\r\n  Short stature.\r\n  Childlike voice.\r\n  Bitemporal headache.\r\n  Supraorbital headache.\r\n  Sterility.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Adrenal Stigmata_\r\n\r\n  Aggressive type of individual.\r\n  Increased growth of hair on body.\r\n  Masculine type of female and vice versa.\r\n  Prominent canine teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n _So-called Deficiency Symptoms_\r\n\r\n  Asthenia.\r\n  Low blood pressure.\r\n  Muscular pains.\r\n  Fatigability.\r\n  Pigmentation.\r\n  Sergent's white line.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Thymus Stigmata_\r\n\r\n  Very long stature.\r\n  High palatal arch.\r\n  Infantile epiglottis.\r\n  Lymphocytosis.\r\n  General glandular enlargement.\r\n  Abnormally long thorax.\r\n  Visceroptosis.\r\n  Eosinophilia.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Gonadal Stigmata_\r\n\r\n  Hermaphroditism.\r\n  Pale, anemic skin.\r\n  Flushes in the female.\r\n  Scanty growth of lanugolike hair.\r\n  Sparse eyebrows.\r\n  Dull, lethargic mentality.\r\n  Characteristic pyramidal pubic hair in males and flat in females.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Symptoms of So-called Gonadal Hyperactivity_\r\n\r\n  Precocious sexual activity.\r\n  Jolly, gay disposition.\r\n  Marked fecundity.\r\n  Menorrhagia or metrorhagia.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Symptoms of So-called Hyposecretion_\r\n\r\n  Infantilism.\r\n  Small, atrophic testes.\r\n  Late menstruation.\r\n  Menorrhagia.\r\n  Dysmenorrhea.\r\n  Infantile uterus.\r\n  Nervous constipation.\r\n  Deficient lateral incisors.\r\n  Sterility.\r\n  Absent lateral incisors.\r\n\r\n\r\n _Pineal Stigmata_\r\n\r\n (occur only in children)\r\n\r\n  Precocious sexual and mental development.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that he associates manic symptoms, increased\r\nemotional irritability, ideas of reference and persecution with\r\nthyroid hyperactivity and speaks of a sluggish mentality in pituitary\r\ndeficiency and gonadal stigmata. Blumgarten's summary of these\r\nconditions is very interesting: \"The study of the various stigmata\r\nshows that many of these are present regularly in certain types of\r\nindividuals. Consequently we may group individuals from an endocrine\r\nviewpoint into various types according to the prominent endocrine\r\nstigmata which they show. For example, the nervous, thin individual\r\nwith tachycardia, rather prominent eyeballs, fine, delicate hair,\r\nsuffering occasionally from gastric symptoms, suggests the thyroid\r\ntype, as does also the clean-cut, alert individual, and the young woman\r\nsuffering with amenorrhea and a tendency to obesity and lethargic\r\nmentality. On the other hand, the aggressive, energetic individual,\r\nwith the history of an ancestry subject to vascular disease, with\r\nhigh blood pressure, with abundant, unusual distribution of hair and\r\na tendency to pigmentation, suggests the adrenal type. And so does\r\nthe tired, asthenic individual with low blood pressure and Sergent's\r\nwhite line, who may have had influenza or diphtheria and even may be\r\nsuffering from tuberculosis. On the other hand, however, the heavily\r\nbuilt individual with broad, large frame, wide intercostal angle, broad\r\nnose, prominent supra-orbital ridges, prominent lips, large, square\r\nfingers, suggests the pituitary type. These individuals are very fond\r\nof meats, are heavy eaters, and are constantly subject to diseases of a\r\ngouty nature, may have a history of syphilis, are often musical and, as\r\na rule, are usually successful in their particular community.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Kaplan[108] \"such states as lack of courage, melancholy,\r\nsuicidal tendencies, dementia praecox, precocious adolescence, and\r\nimmature senility, sadism and masochism; all of these are possible\r\nmanifestations in a gonadotrop individual.\" Garretson[109] is of the\r\nopinion that the \"large group of patients generally misunderstood and\r\nfrequently classed in civil life as neurasthenics, psychasthenics,\r\nhysterics, cyclothymics, and hypochondriacs, is now capable of an\r\nintelligent analysis and rational therapy, if one will concede that\r\nthese are the victims of an endocrinic asthenia.\"\r\n\r\nAs an evidence of the influence of the endocrine glands on psychical\r\nfunctions, Falta[110] refers to \"the alteration in character that is\r\nalmost always associated with the development of Basedow's disease;\r\nto the psychical irritability, the inclination to irascibility, the\r\nmanic-euphoristic attitude of patients with Basedow's disease; to the\r\napathy and lack of interest of the myxedematous; to the characteristic\r\nquiet mental attitude in hypophysial dystrophy, and the feeling of\r\nmental want of strength in those suffering with Addison's disease;\r\nto the depressive attitude of the tetany patient, and finally to the\r\nprofound influence that the ripening of the sexual glands at the time\r\nof puberty or the loss of function of the sexual glands in castrates\r\nexercises on the psyche.\" Going into this subject more in detail Falta\r\ngives the following mental symptoms as associated with Basedow's\r\ndisease: abnormal irritability, \"immotivated\" gaiety, hasty speech,\r\nrapid flow of thoughts, a suggestion of flight of ideas, changeable\r\nmoods and terrifying dreams. He also finds an alteration in the\r\npersonality as shown by suspiciousness, capriciousness, irritability\r\nand either euphoric or depressed tendencies. Möbius compares this with\r\na condition of mild intoxication associated with maniacal periods\r\nalternating with depression. Occasional attacks of delirium with\r\nconfusion and hallucinations terminating in coma have been described.\r\nSattler, who has analyzed 150 of these cases as reported in current\r\nliterature, classifies over seventy as cases of manic-depressive\r\ninsanity. Boinet, Parhan and others have shown that depression with\r\nsuicidal inclinations may follow the ingestion of large amounts\r\nof thyroidin. Conditions of excitement have also been reported in\r\nthyroidism, and, according to Falta, are not uncommon. Brunet has\r\nexpressed the opinion that in such cases Basedow's disease acts only as\r\na precipitating factor in an individual predisposed to a psychosis.\r\n\r\nThe English Myxedema Commission found the apathy characteristic of that\r\ndisease present in all but three of 109 cases. This condition develops\r\nearly and may manifest itself in the form of a mild mental dulness.\r\nIntellectual activities are often markedly diminished and there is a\r\nslow, monotonous form of speech. Deterioration may be well developed\r\nand memory seriously impaired. The commission in its investigations\r\nfound illusions in eighteen cases, hallucinations in sixteen and\r\npsychoses in sixteen. These took the form usually of a depression\r\nwith occasional excitements. The symptoms, in some cases at least,\r\ndisappeared after thyroid treatment was instituted.\r\n\r\nThe psychic changes in cretinism have been made the subject of\r\nconsiderable study. The usual mental state is, of course, one of\r\nfeeblemindedness. Perception has been shown to be disturbed, memory is\r\nimpaired and there is a marked emotional deterioration and instability.\r\n\r\nIn the parathyroid form of tetany von Frankl-Hochwart found depressions\r\nand confused states with hallucinations. Depressions were reported by\r\nhim in fourteen of thirty-seven cases examined. Excitements were also\r\nnoted in some instances. Falta refers to \"a characteristic apathy, a\r\nwant of initiative, and a slowing of speech\" in acromegaly. In rare\r\ncases he has also noted mental exaltation. Oppenheim (1914) has called\r\nattention to cases of acromegaly presenting the picture of general\r\nparesis but due to an alteration of glandular functions and not\r\nsyphilitic in origin.\r\n\r\nFalta includes the following in his description of the symptomatology\r\nof Addison's disease: \"Almost always the disease manifests itself\r\nin ready fatigability, disinclination for work, and apathy; to\r\nthese symptoms are sometimes added headaches, poor sleep, sometimes\r\nobstinate insomnia, psychical ill humor and depression, often too,\r\nabnormal irritability; further, diminution in memory, noises in\r\nthe ears, vertigo and commonly fainting attacks, singultus, and\r\nrheumatoid pains in the back and in the extremities, sometimes, also\r\nepileptiform convulsions. Extremely stormy manifestations on the part\r\nof the nervous system may, especially in the later stages, make their\r\nappearance—violent delirium, acute confusion, convulsions, deep\r\nstupor, and coma.\"\r\n\r\nRaeder[111] has made an analysis of glandular involvements found in\r\nthe study of one hundred cases of feeblemindedness at autopsy. He\r\nclassifies these as 1, extreme changes—in which three or four glands\r\nwere involved and where there were marked anomalies of growth,\r\nunderdevelopment, disproportion of the body parts, etc.; 2, marked\r\nchanges—in which at least two glands were involved and where there\r\nwere distinct changes in growth and anomalous development; 3, moderate\r\nchanges—in which one or two glands were involved; and 4, cases where\r\nno glandular involvement was found. He noted extreme changes in ten per\r\ncent of the series, marked changes in eleven per cent, moderate changes\r\nin fifty-three per cent and none at all in twenty-six per cent. Sixty\r\nper cent of these individuals showed deviation from the normal in size,\r\nfifty-one per cent were undersized and nine per cent were above the\r\naverage height, while thirty-eight per cent were normal. The pituitary\r\nwas found to be involved in forty per cent of the one hundred cases,\r\nthe thyroid in nineteen per cent, the suprarenal in twenty-seven per\r\ncent, the sex glands in thirty-eight per cent, the thymus in twelve\r\nper cent and other glands in six per cent. He frequently found several\r\ninvolved: \"Pituitary with gonads in nine cases, was the most common\r\ndual adenosis, though there were combinations of sex and thyroid in\r\nfour instances, sex and suprarenal in four cases, and in three cases\r\nthe thyroids, pituitary and gonads were affected in triple involvement.\r\nFurthermore, there were six cases in which the gonads were combined\r\nwith three other glands; two included the gonads, thyroid, pituitary\r\nand suprarenal; two, gonads, thyroid, pituitary and thymus.\" Further\r\ninvestigation only can accurately determine the exact relation which\r\nexists between disturbance of these glands and the presence of mental\r\ndeficiency.\r\n\r\nAttention was called some time since to the fact that the injection\r\nof adrenalin leads to an increase in blood pressure. This has been\r\ndiscussed by Falta, Newburgh, Nobel and others. Neubürger[112] made a\r\nstudy of thirty-nine cases, seven of which were normal, the others\r\nincluding alcoholism, neurasthenia, manic-depressive, etc., but not\r\ndementia praecox. A fairly well marked rise of blood pressure followed\r\nadrenalin injection very quickly, reaching its maximum in from six\r\nto twelve minutes. He found the reaction diminished or absent in\r\neighty per cent of the sixty-three cases of dementia praecox which he\r\nexamined, but does not advance the claim that this can be utilized\r\nfor diagnostic purposes. Walter and Krumbach[113] found an increased\r\npressure in sixty per cent of normal control cases and obtained similar\r\nreactions in dementia praecox. Schmidt, on the other hand, confirmed\r\nthe findings of Neubürger. Emerson[114] found status lymphaticus in over\r\ntwenty-nine per cent of his cases of dementia praecox and Davis[115]\r\nfound the same condition in twenty-four per cent of war neuroses in\r\na series of over one hundred cases. These findings, however, lack\r\nconfirmation by other observers. Straus[116] includes as mental\r\nsymptoms in thyroidal disbalance: sluggish mental reactions alternating\r\nwith sparkling wit, irritability, general moodiness and depression,\r\ndifficulty in thought with inability to concentrate, forgetfulness,\r\nfatigability and somnolence.\r\n\r\nTurro[117] has shown that all of the physical evidences of\r\nfright—pallor, dilatation of the pupils, rapid pulse, cutis anserinus,\r\nperspiration, etc., can be produced experimentally by the injection of\r\nepinephrin in certain cases. Knauer and Billigheimer[118] have called\r\nattention to the striking similarity between the functional changes\r\nto be found in disturbances of the vegetative (sympathetic) nervous\r\nsystem and certain manifestations associated with fear neuroses. They\r\nattribute these disturbances to congenital inferiority, toxic sources,\r\nemotional shock or fatigue.\r\n\r\nA uniform defective development of the physical and mental personality\r\nof the individual has been designated by Lasègue as infantilismus.\r\nAs described by Di Gaspero and de Sanctis the mental status of these\r\ncases belongs to the domain of feeblemindedness and in some instances\r\nto imbecility. According to Kraepelin[119] the attention is easily\r\nattracted and as easily distracted. These individuals are inquisitive\r\nand flighty. Apprehension is defective. What they hear and see can only\r\nbe related in a fragmentary and unreliable manner. They often learn\r\nreadily and forget as quickly. Pende described the mental development\r\nas only one-third of the normal. Memory gaps are supplied by\r\nexaggeration and fabrication, as influenced by emotion or suggestion.\r\nDi Gaspero found falsification of memory in twenty per cent of\r\nhis cases. Imagination is very active with a tendency to dreamlike\r\nunrealities, wonderful tales of adventure, etc. Mental processes are\r\ninadequate, vague and uncertain. The real and the unreal are not\r\nclearly differentiated. Explanations and descriptions are inaccurate\r\nand indefinite. Standards of value, size or time are vague. The store\r\nof ideas is impoverished and associations are poor. Calculations\r\nare slow and faulty. These persons are illogical, impractical and\r\ncredulous. They are swayed by prejudices, catchwords and hasty\r\njudgment. Their range of thought is narrow and their viewpoint of life\r\nchildish. The emotional and volitional content is immature. They are\r\ncheerful but lack earnestness, and are often ambitious and boastful. At\r\nother times they are likely to be despondent, timid, anxious, fearful\r\nand lacking in self-confidence. The mood is exceedingly variable. They\r\nare not industrious, cannot apply themselves constantly to any line of\r\nwork, and tire easily. Their conduct is very uncertain and unreliable.\r\nSome have criminal tendencies. Occasionally hysterical symptoms appear.\r\nEvidences of an absence of physical development manifest themselves\r\nin all varieties of immaturity. These defects, according to Falta,\r\nare shown especially in the genitalia and the lymphatic apparatus,\r\nwith a delay in the closure of the epiphysis and the retention of a\r\nchildish physique generally. The skeletal framework shows a failure of\r\ndevelopment, the lower length of the body exceeds the upper slightly,\r\nif at all, the head is relatively large, the bones slender and the\r\npelvis infantile in type. The sexual organs and the \"vita sexualis\"\r\nare those of a child. The blood shows a large lymphocyte count and a\r\ndefinite status lymphaticus is sometimes found to be present. The hairy\r\ndevelopment of the pubis and axillary surface is slight. The internal\r\norgans are normal. True infantilism, according to Falta, is not due to\r\na glandular disturbance. He also maintains that the mind, while that of\r\na child, is normal otherwise and shows no defects. Juvenile myxedema,\r\nhypophysial dystrophy and eunuchoidism, Falta would not include with\r\nthe infantilismus group. Infantilism has been ascribed to syphilis,\r\ntuberculosis, alcoholism, etc., of the parents. Brissaud in 1907\r\nadvanced the theory that it was a hypothyroid symptom. His views have\r\nbeen supported by various other writers, although not shared by either\r\nFalta or Kraepelin. The latter has also described mental conditions\r\nmore or less suggesting feeblemindedness and associated with lesions of\r\nthe hypophysis, the pineal gland, the adrenals, the sexual glands and\r\nthe thymus.\r\n\r\nLesions in the anterior lobe of the pituitary result in gigantism or\r\nacromegaly, with a childish mentality most marked in the emotional\r\nsphere. These persons are usually indifferent, good-natured and\r\nboastful, and at the same time clumsy and inactive. A diminished\r\nactivity of the glandular portion of the hypophysis means dwarfism.\r\nLesions of the posterior or \"nervous\" lobe may cause \"dystrophia\r\nadiposo genitalis,\" the \"adipositas dolorosa\" of Dercum. The mental\r\nstatus in this condition Kraepelin compares to that described in\r\nacromegaly—apathy and indifference, with occasional restless or\r\nexcited types. The intellectual capacity may be normal, mediocre or\r\nsomewhat deficient.\r\n\r\nThe pineal gland is spoken of as having a very definite relation to\r\nsexual development. Extirpation is said to lead to rapid development\r\nof the body, the accumulation of fat and early sexual development,—a\r\ncondition described by Pellizzi as \"makro-genitosomia praecoce.\"\r\nSchüller in fifty-one cases with pineal involvements found ten\r\noccurring during the first decade of life. Death usually takes\r\nplace within a few months or years. Similar conditions result from\r\nhyperactivity of the adrenal cortex,—rapid development of the body,\r\nand particularly of the sexual organs, obesity and overgrowth of the\r\nhair and beard. Wiesel described as a \"suprarenal genital symptom\r\ncomplex\" cases of pseudo-hermaphrodism in women.\r\n\r\nLesions of the adrenal, as studies of Addison's disease show, have,\r\naccording to Kraepelin,[120] the following symptoms: weakness of memory,\r\napathy, dulness, inactivity and inhibition of growth. He also calls\r\nattention to the fact that in anencephaly, hemicephaly and microcephaly\r\ndefective development of the adrenals is very common. \"Eunuchoidismus\"\r\nand \"viriginität\" with mental symptoms due to defective development of\r\nthe sex glands are also described. The physical manifestations include\r\ndefective secondary sexual characteristics, in men in the growth of\r\nthe beard and change of the voice, and in women in the development\r\nof the mammary glands, the fat deposits and the curve of the hips.\r\nThere is a failure of sexual development and absence of menses, as\r\nwell as defective physical growth. Eunuchoidismus may manifest itself\r\nin a giantism somewhat suggesting that resulting from lesions of the\r\npituitary or in a dwarflike physical development. The former variety\r\nis characterized by an unusual height with long arms and legs. The\r\nforehead is receding, with a low hair line. The external genitals are\r\nvery small and there is little pubic or axillary hair. Ossification is\r\ndelayed. In the second form (dwarfs) the body, arms and legs are short\r\nand thick. The head is large and the neck short. The genitals are small\r\nand the penis is short and button-shaped. Hair formation is slight. The\r\nmental condition in either case is characterized by an intellectual\r\ndefect with timidity, emotional instability, helplessness and weakness\r\nof will, sometimes with an active imagination. Kraepelin also describes\r\nendocrine conditions resulting from thymic lesions—thymic idiocy,\r\nstatus thymolymphaticus—and mentions the pancreatic infantilismus\r\nreferred to by Brownell, Basedow's disease, acromegaly, pluriglandular\r\ninsufficiency and other conditions already mentioned. Kraepelin has\r\nencountered only seven \"dysadenoid\" forms in a study of 244 cases.\r\nBourneville has reported 104 cases of persistent thymus.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting contributions to the literature of\r\nendocrinology is Mott's[121] suggestion that dementia praecox is due\r\nto a combination of degenerative changes in the cortical neurones and\r\nthe generative organs. As a result of the study of twenty-two cases of\r\ndementia praecox he found that more marked pathological changes were\r\nfound in the testes than were observed in cases of manic-depressive\r\ninsanity, alcoholic psychoses, epilepsy or paranoia. The characteristic\r\nfindings consisted in regressive changes in the seminal tubules and\r\nabnormal staining reactions in the spermatozoa. He found more evidences\r\nof virility in a senile individual of eighty than in any of his cases\r\nof dementia praecox. His theory as to the pathogenesis of the disease\r\nis based on the fact that the changes in the neurones are of the same\r\ncharacter—a degeneration of the nuclear elements. These findings have\r\nnot at this time been confirmed by other observers.\r\n\r\nTimme[122] has described a psychic makeup due to subinvolution of the\r\nthymus. \"The mental picture presented by these subinvoluted thymic\r\nstates is also of great importance, for analogous to their structural\r\nlack of differentiation is their psychic makeup. They remain child-like\r\nin their character, so that they are self-centered; simple in their\r\nmental processes and imitative; looking for protection and care, and\r\nmore or less unfitted for the active struggles of life. They are\r\nobstinate and negativistic; if, however, an efficient compensation\r\ntakes place, then, although the mental development may have been\r\ndelayed, it nevertheless seems finally to reach complete maturity; and\r\nthese individuals are among the brightest and most intelligent of their\r\ncommunity.\" In cases of precocious involution of the thymus he finds\r\nthe mental condition to be of chief interest. \"They are precocious,\r\nwith much initiative, are easily aroused to anger and are resentful.\r\nThey have cruel instincts and show little inhibition. Although they\r\nseem far advanced for their years while still young, yet they never\r\nseem thoroughly to mature, and become blocked in early adolescence.\r\nThey seem to retain their impulsive, unreasoning characteristics, brook\r\nno restraint and remain constantly a prey to their easily aroused\r\nanger.\" Of thyroid insufficiency he says: \"Mentally, the patient is\r\ndull, sluggish and with little initiative. He moves slowly and thinks\r\nslowly, is extremely forgetful and his lethargy is occasionally\r\ndisturbed by outbursts of anger due probably to his maladjustment\r\nto the more quickly moving world about him.\" In his summary of the\r\nhyperthyroid makeup, Timme says: \"Both mind and body are everlastingly\r\nbusy. And not only with present problems, but anticipatory of\r\ntomorrow's as well. The patient shows no rest or relaxation. His mind,\r\nfilled with echoes of the day's troubles, prevents his falling to sleep\r\nuntil long after he retires, and he is again awake and immediately on\r\nthe \"qui vive\" as soon as daylight comes.\" Statistics on endocrine\r\nconditions are unfortunately not available as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN PROGRESS OF PSYCHIATRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remarkable accomplishments of medical science during the last\r\nfew decades may be looked upon as a fairly accurate index of modern\r\nprogress in general. Nor have these advances been confined to any\r\nlimited field. Standards of education have changed with almost\r\nstartling rapidity. The most extended course of instruction open\r\nto medical students fifty or sixty years ago covered a period of\r\ntwo years. Qualifications for entrance consisted in little more\r\nthan a demonstration of the candidate's ability to pay the required\r\nmatriculation fee. The three year course, only recently established\r\nand generally recognized, was lengthened to four years during the\r\nlatter part of the nineteenth century. The number of medical colleges\r\nhas been materially reduced and the size of the graduating classes has\r\ndecreased fifty per cent or more during the last twenty-five years\r\nas a result of the higher standards. Several of our medical schools\r\nadmit college graduates only and two years of college work is now a\r\nminimum entrance requirement in institutions of the highest type.\r\nVery few men feel properly equipped for taking up the practice of\r\nmedicine today until they have had an experience of at least a year in\r\na general hospital. The profession is tending more and more towards\r\nspecialization and the old-fashioned general practitioner is now at a\r\nconsiderable disadvantage. Ophthalmology has become almost an exact\r\nscience. Gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatrists, orthopedists,\r\nlaryngologists, neurologists and internists are looked upon as almost\r\nindispensable in a community of any size. All of these specialists are\r\nmore or less dependent on the cooperation of a pathologist, who can do\r\nnothing without a well equipped laboratory at his disposal. Surgery has\r\nlong been regarded as a specialty which required an extended training\r\nas well as years of experience.\r\n\r\nThe progress of modern medical science has been almost bewildering. It\r\nhas been a comparatively short time since the principles of antisepsis\r\nand asepsis were established by Lister. The plasmodium of malaria was\r\ndescribed in 1880. It was not until 1882 that the tubercle bacillus was\r\ndiscovered by Koch. Diphtheria was rendered an almost harmless disease\r\nby the discovery of a specific antitoxin. The uncertainties relating\r\nto the diagnosis of typhoid fever were entirely removed when the Widal\r\nreaction came into general use. The Roentgen ray has revolutionized\r\nsurgery. The diagnostic and therapeutic use of tuberculin has been of\r\ninestimable value to internal medicine. Schaudinn's discovery of the\r\ntreponema pallidum in 1905 cleared up one of the greatest scientific\r\nmysteries of modern times. The introduction of salvarsan has added\r\na new and important chapter to our history of therapeutics. The\r\nWassermann reaction represents probably the most important diagnostic\r\ndiscovery of the century. The recent studies of the so-called ductless\r\nglands have opened up new and important fields of research which\r\npromise to be far-reaching in their results. Social service, unknown\r\nonly a few years ago, is now an indispensable adjunct of the modern\r\nhospital organization. Training schools for nurses have become highly\r\nspecialized educational institutions.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said of the progress made in our knowledge of mental\r\ndiseases? Certainly much has been accomplished during the last\r\ncentury. The earliest American contributor to this branch of medicine\r\nwas Benjamin Rush (1745-1813), professor in the Medical Department\r\nof the University of Pennsylvania, member of the Continental\r\nCongress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and one time\r\nphysician-in-chief to the American armies. His \"Medical Inquiries and\r\nObservations into Diseases of the Mind,\" which appeared in 1812 was the\r\nfirst publication of the kind in this country. It is interesting to\r\nnote that he condemned the misuse of mechanical restraint, advocated\r\nhydrotherapy and recommended the appointment of instructors to\r\ndirect the employment and amusement of patients. Incidentally he was\r\nthe chairman of a committee appointed by the College of Physicians\r\nof Philadelphia to memorialize Congress and the legislature of\r\nPennsylvania on the evils of alcoholism. Reference should also be made\r\nto the fact that he opposed capital punishment, advocated the abolition\r\nof slavery and objected to the study of the classics as a required\r\npart of the college curriculum. He even favored woman suffrage. In\r\naddition to his other activities this remarkable man was treasurer at\r\none time of the United States Mint, vice-president of the American\r\nBible Society, one of the founders of Dickinson College and associated\r\nfor many years with Franklin in the work of the American Philosophical\r\nSociety. Certainly he was many years in advance of his time. When\r\nhis work on \"Diseases of the Mind\" appeared, the word psychiatry was\r\nunknown in this country. The term lunatic, which first appeared in\r\nthe English statutes in 1320, during the reign of Edward the Second,\r\nwas still in quite general use. The only state hospital for mental\r\ndiseases was the one at Williamsburg, Virginia. Such institutions were\r\nuniversally known as asylums for many years.\r\n\r\nInsanity was generally discussed in the terminology of Pinel and\r\nEsquirol as including mania, melancholia, dementia and idiocy. Those\r\nnot thoroughly familiar with the psychiatry of the past may not\r\nunderstand the sense in which the word dementia was employed. It was\r\ndefined by Esquirol in the following terms: \"There exists, therefore,\r\na form of mental alienation which is very distinct—in which the\r\ndisorder of the ideas, affections and determinations is characterized\r\nby feebleness and by the abolition, more or less marked, of all the\r\nsensitive, intellectual, and voluntary faculties. This is dementia.\" It\r\nwas looked upon usually as a terminal state following excitements or\r\ndepressions and in some rare instances as being primary in origin.\r\n\r\nThere have been many important developments in psychiatry since the\r\ndays of Benjamin Rush. The mania, melancholia and dementia of the\r\neighteenth century have apparently gone for all time. The events of\r\nthe last hundred years include more particularly the delimitation and\r\ncomplete differentiation of general paresis, the rise and fall of the\r\nparanoia concept, the description of the traumatic psychoses, the\r\nestablishment of the alcoholic insanities as clinical entities, a study\r\nof the mental diseases due to endogenous and exogenous toxins, the\r\nrecognition of the neuroses and psychoneuroses in their modern sense,\r\nthe addition of the psychopathic personalities to our classification\r\nand the definition of manic-depressive insanity, dementia praecox and\r\ninvolutional melancholia. The mental states due to somatic conditions\r\nhave been exhaustively studied and the psychoses associated with\r\nepilepsy and pellagra have been fully investigated. Psychology and\r\npsychiatry have been definitely correlated and pathological research\r\nplaced upon a firm foundation. The psychiatric phraseology of today\r\nwould have been practically meaningless to the students of Pinel.\r\nCuriously enough the word psychiatry, which goes back to nearly 1800 in\r\nthe literature of Germany and Italy has only been used for a few years\r\nin this country and England. The word psychosis is of even more recent\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThis modern era may be said to have been ushered in by the preliminary\r\nstudies made of general paresis by Haslam in 1798. These were\r\nfollowed by the researches of Bayle, Delaye and finally Calmeil,\r\nwhich definitely established the integrity of that disease as a\r\nclinical entity. Even then its specific origin was only a matter of\r\nconjecture. When Esmarch and Jessen suggested that general paresis\r\nwas a syphilitic disease in 1857, their views were rejected by men as\r\nprominent as Charcot and Déjerine. Although paranoia is a term which\r\nhas appeared in the literature of medicine for centuries, it has only\r\nhad the significance now attached to it since the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century. Its description was foreshadowed perhaps by the\r\nmonomania of Esquirol and Pritchard and the partial insanity of Rush\r\nand others. Heinroth, Griesinger, Magnan, Lasègue, Régis, Falret,\r\nMendel, Krafft-Ebing, Herz, Snell, Werner, Schüle, Ziehen, Kraepelin\r\nand many other well-known psychiatrists have played a part in the\r\nevolution of paranoia which only definitely displaced the wahnsinn,\r\nverrüchtheit, and various other designations of the earlier writers,\r\nin the neighborhood of 1890. Paranoia is a term which has only been\r\ninfrequently used since the general acceptance of Kraepelin's paranoid\r\nforms of dementia praecox. Its territory has been still further invaded\r\nby paraphrenia, the fate of which, however, is somewhat uncertain as\r\nyet. The forerunners of the psychopathic personalities were the moral\r\ninsanity of Pritchard, the insanity of degeneracy of Morel, Magnan,\r\nRégis, Lombroso, etc., and the \"demifous et demiresponsables\" of\r\nGrasset, Trélat and others. The introduction of the \"constitutional\r\ninferiority\" idea into the psychiatry of this country was directly\r\nattributable to Adolf Meyer following the work of Koch in Germany.\r\nAfter the elaborate study of alcoholism made by Magnus Huss in 1852 the\r\npsychoses due to that condition were described by Bonhöffer, Magnan,\r\nKorsakow, Kraepelin and various other writers. The psychoneuroses\r\nrepresent the developments of Brachet, who wrote on hysteria in 1847,\r\nBriquet, Oppenheim, Lasègue, Möbius, Charcot, Janet, Babinski, Beard,\r\nKraepelin and many others. To Meyer again we are indebted for the\r\nfirst exhaustive study and classification of the traumatic psychoses.\r\nThe description of amentia by Meynert in 1881 was of considerable\r\nsignificance. The first comprehensive study of mental disorders\r\nassociated with the use of cocaine was made by Erlenmeyer in 1886. The\r\nsame writer was responsible for the first elaborate investigation of\r\nmorphinism in the year following. Circular insanity was described by\r\nFalret in 1851 and again as \"folie à double forme\" by Baillarger in\r\n1854. Hecker was responsible for an event of great importance in the\r\nhistory of psychiatry when he published his description of hebephrenia\r\nin 1871. Kahlbaum in his \"Katatonia\" made a contribution which was\r\ndestined to influence the future of medicine in 1874.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile what is to be said as to the progress of pathological\r\nresearch? The earliest contribution to psychiatry from that point of\r\nview was made by Morgagni in 1761, his opinions being based on the\r\nautopsy reports in some thirteen cases. Greding in 1790 published the\r\nresults of autopsies in a series of thirty-seven cases. The findings\r\nat that time included variations in the thickness of the skull,\r\nadhesions and thickenings of the dura, changes in the consistency of\r\nthe cerebrum and cerebellum, effusions into the ventricles and various\r\ngross defects. The early writers attached a great deal of importance\r\nto the pineal gland changes. These pathological conditions were so\r\ngenerally reported, that Portal in the eighteenth century went so far\r\nas to say that \"Morbid alteration in the brain or spinal marrow has\r\nbeen so constantly observed, that I should greatly prefer to doubt the\r\nsufficiency of my senses, if I should not at any time discover any\r\nmorbid change in the brain, than to believe that mental disease could\r\nexist without any physical disorder in this viscus, or in one or other\r\nof its appurtenances.\" Pinel spoke very discouragingly, however, of the\r\nresults and Esquirol finally reached the conclusion that nothing really\r\nimportant had been accomplished after all. In his Charenton reports\r\n(1835) he expressed himself on this subject as follows:—\"However\r\nimportant may have been the researches of anatomists made during our\r\ndays into diseases which affect the mind, we may venture to repeat\r\nthat pathological anatomy is yet silent as to the seat of madness,\r\nand that it has not yet demonstrated what is the precise alteration\r\nin the encephalon which gives rise to this disease. What shall we,\r\nthen, think of the rash pretensions of those who assume that they can\r\nfix upon the diseased portion of the brain, judging merely from the\r\ncharacter of the disease?\" In 1836 Guislain summarized the various\r\nlesions found in insanity at autopsy under nine headings—congestion of\r\nthe brain or meninges or both, serous congestion of the same, cerebral\r\nsoftening, adhesions of the membranes to each other or to the brain,\r\ncerebral induration, cerebral hypertrophy, and abnormalities of the\r\nbrain or skull. The appointment of a pathologist at the Utica State\r\nHospital in 1868 as a result of the remarkable interest taken in this\r\nsubject by Dr. John P. Gray must be looked upon as one of the important\r\nevents in the history of American psychiatry. The later developments of\r\nthe nineteenth century included studies of general paresis, cerebral\r\nsyphilis, arteriosclerosis, senility, epilepsy, mental deficiency,\r\npellagra and various other somatic conditions. It may fairly be said,\r\nat least, that pathology has kept fully abreast of the progress made by\r\nclinical psychiatry during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all of these advances, the generally recognized mental\r\ndiseases, as late as 1895, included the following types:—mania,\r\nmelancholia, dementia, imbecility, idiocy, general paresis, chronic\r\ndelusional insanity or paranoia and senile insanity. This was in\r\nsubstance the psychiatry of Savage, Maudsley, Clouston, Blandfield,\r\nRégis, Chapin, Kellogg, Spitzka, Kirchoff, Berkley and many other\r\nwell-known writers of a comparatively recent date. A new era in the\r\nhistory of mental medicine was ushered in by Kraepelin when the sixth\r\nedition of his \"Psychiatrie\" appeared in 1899. This established\r\nmanic-depressive insanity and dementia praecox as clinical entities.\r\nKraepelin called attention to the fact that excitements and depressions\r\nfrequently recur in the same individual, often with frequent attacks\r\nbut with no marked tendency towards mental enfeeblement. This class of\r\ncases he grouped together as manic-depressive psychoses and pointed\r\nout certain characteristics common to the excitements and depressions\r\nincluded. He showed that certain other forms of depression marked\r\nby anxiety, fear, restlessness, self-accusation, marked suicidal\r\ntendencies, etc., were common to the involutional period of life.\r\nTo this anxious depression the name involution melancholia has been\r\napplied, although Kraepelin is now somewhat in doubt as to its\r\ndifferentiation from the manic-depressive group. To certain other\r\ncases characterized by emotional dulness, apathy, hallucinations with\r\nphantastic delusions, and in some types, mannerisms, negativism,\r\nstereotypy, verbigeration, etc., tending sooner or later towards\r\ndeterioration, he attached the name dementia praecox. This included the\r\nhebephrenia of Hecker and the katatonia of Kahlbaum.\r\n\r\nWernicke in 1906 advanced the hypothesis that psychical symptoms may\r\nbe attributed to disturbances of various association mechanisms. These\r\ninterruptions were to be found in various parts of the psychical\r\nreflex arcs. This included the psychosensory tracts or receptive\r\nmechanisms, the intrapsychical tracts or elaboration mechanisms and the\r\npsychomotor mechanisms. Manic-depressive psychoses were looked upon as\r\nrepresenting a disorder of the intrapsychic mechanism, while dementia\r\npraecox was considered to be an illustration of a disturbance of the\r\npsychomotor mechanisms. This was an exceedingly interesting but purely\r\ntheoretical scheme for putting psychiatry on a definite anatomical and\r\npathological basis.\r\n\r\nThe progress made by Kraepelin, Stransky, Wernicke, Bleuler, Ziehen\r\nand other modern psychiaters led to renewed interest in pathological\r\nresearch. This was to a considerable extent due to the suggestion\r\nof Kraepelin that dementia praecox was autotoxic and endogenous in\r\norigin. The neurons were exhaustively studied by Alzheimer and changes\r\nin metabolism thoroughly investigated by Folin and many others. To\r\nthe researches of Nissl and Alzheimer in 1904 we are largely indebted\r\nfor an accurate knowledge of general paresis. Studies of the cortex\r\nin dementia praecox by Alzheimer and many others have been extremely\r\ninteresting if not conclusive. The introduction of lumbar puncture\r\nby Quincke and the studies of the cerebrospinal fluid made by Widal,\r\nPlaut, Nonne, Mott and others were of great aid in diagnostic\r\nprocedure. These have been supplemented by the Wassermann reaction, the\r\ncolloidal gold test, etc. The isolation of the treponema pallidum in\r\nthe cortex settled the question of the identity of general paresis and\r\ncerebral syphilis for all time.\r\n\r\nAnother line of research responsible in no small measure for the\r\nremarkable progress of psychiatry during the last few decades was\r\nthat instituted by Freud, Jung and others in their studies of\r\npsychological mechanisms. It is a rather remarkable fact that it is\r\nonly in comparatively recent years that a study of the psychological\r\nprocesses of the normal mind has been looked upon as essential to an\r\nunderstanding of the mental reactions involved in the development of a\r\npsychoneurosis or psychosis. This is really the basis of Freud's work.\r\n\r\nPsychiatry may be said to be practically the only branch of medical\r\nscience in which a study of pathological processes has not been based\r\nlargely upon physiological and anatomical foundations. Our textbooks\r\nfor many years have insisted that \"insanity\" was a disease of the\r\nbrain but have not given much consideration to a correlation of the\r\nphysiology with the pathology of that organ. The application of\r\npsychological methods to psychiatric research was largely a result\r\nof the studies of hysteria by Janet. This was supplemented by the\r\nimportant contribution of Breuer and Freud in 1895 calling attention\r\nto their theories in regard to the production of the psychoneuroses\r\nby psychic traumas, usually of a sexual nature. Freud's views\r\nwere outlined more fully in his \"Selected Papers on Hysteria,\"\r\n\"Three Contributions to the Sexual Theory,\" and his studies of the\r\n\"Psychopathology of Everyday Life,\" etc. The psychological processes of\r\ndementia praecox and paranoia were subjected to elaborate studies by\r\nFreud, Jung and various other authors.\r\n\r\nThe relation existing between psychology and psychiatry has been placed\r\non a very practical basis by the studies of shell shock and other\r\nhysterical conditions so important during the recent war. Probably\r\nnothing will contribute more towards a recognition of the importance\r\nof psychiatry than the discovery made early in the war that mental\r\ndiseases and defects were responsible for more disabilities than were\r\nattributable to almost any other single cause. Certainly the inactivity\r\nof many years has been followed by an awakening which has placed modern\r\npsychiatry on a dignified plane and its progress will now compare\r\nfavorably with the accomplishments of any other branch of medicine.\r\nThe statement is, I think, justified, that psychiatry has been\r\nestablished on a thoroughly scientific basis as the result of the work\r\nof comparatively few years. We have, however, reached a stage where\r\ncareful analyses should be made of the clinical data upon which future\r\nprogress entirely depends.\r\n\r\nA brief consideration of existing conditions should be sufficient to\r\nshow this conclusively. Psychiatric literature is, and for many years\r\nhas been, characterized largely by an unfortunate absence of accurate\r\nscientific information which would warrant the conclusions reached in\r\nmany instances by the authors of our textbooks. We have been subjected\r\nto an avalanche of theories and a remarkable paucity of facts. In the\r\ndiscussion of abstract propositions where concrete evidence is not\r\nobtainable this is of course unavoidable. There has, however, been a\r\nvery noticeable oversight of many facts which the wealth of clinical\r\nmaterial in our hospitals has placed at our disposal. Our literature\r\nhas been filled with too many unsubstantiated statements. There is\r\nno reason why many of the views entertained by various authorities\r\nshould be matters of personal opinion or based entirely on individual\r\nobservation. The fact that there are over two hundred thousand cases\r\nof mental disease in the state hospitals of this country, with an\r\nadmission rate of sixty thousand annually, is sufficient evidence to\r\njustify the statement that there is no lack of material for accurate\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nA brief reference to some of the discrepancies shown in a consideration\r\nof the various psychoses will serve to illustrate the need of more\r\naccurate information on many of these subjects. In discussing the\r\npredisposing causes of mental diseases, for instance, White[123] made\r\nthe following statement, which is perfectly correct: \"An inherited\r\npredisposition to mental disorder is found in from 30 to 90 per cent\r\nof cases according to different authorities, while the average for all\r\nconditions has been estimated at from 60 to 70 per cent.\" Information\r\non this subject is certainly far from being complete or satisfactory.\r\nThe Thirty-first annual report of the State Hospital Commission shows\r\nthat of 4,492 first admissions to the New York hospitals during the\r\nyear ending June 30, 1919, 2,003, or 44.6 per cent, were reported as\r\nhaving a family history of insanity, nervous diseases, alcoholism or\r\nother neuropathic taint. As far as could be determined 55.4 per cent\r\nshowed no evidence of heredity in their family history. The necessity\r\nof further information on this important subject would appear to be\r\nobvious. The question as to the relation between syphilis and general\r\nparesis may be said to have been definitely settled for all time. The\r\norigin of this disease has, however, been the subject of controversy\r\nsince 1857. Paton[124] in a review of this discussion in 1905 states\r\nthat Gudden found a history of syphilis in 35.7 per cent of his cases,\r\nHirsch, in fifty-six per cent, Jolly, in sixty-nine, Mendel, in\r\nseventy-five, and Alzheimer, in ninety per cent. In the light of our\r\npresent knowledge this difference of opinion and experience is quite\r\ninteresting and illuminating.\r\n\r\nThe most extravagant and misleading statements made about etiological\r\nfactors, perhaps, are those which relate to the alcoholic psychoses.\r\nThis was due largely to the statements of enthusiastic propagandists\r\nwho were advocating prohibitory legislation. The facts of the matter\r\nare that when the use of liquor was unrestricted, the admission rate of\r\nalcoholic psychoses, as shown by the New York state hospital reports,\r\nhad averaged ten per cent for a number of years (1908 to 1913).\r\n\r\nFrequent contributions have been made from time to time to the\r\nliterature of psychiatry on the subject of dementia praecox. Voluminous\r\narticles have been written on its pathology, psychological mechanisms,\r\netiology, etc. Many of the theories advanced are not in harmony with\r\nwhat little definite information we possess. Many of the theses on\r\nthis subject have been based on the study of a surprisingly small\r\nnumber of cases. The statement has been made[125] that attacks either\r\nof a syncopal or epileptic nature are among the most important\r\nphysical symptoms of dementia praecox, and \"occur in about eighteen\r\nper cent of the cases.\" In his eighth edition Kraepelin speaks of\r\nconvulsive attacks of various sorts in sixteen per cent of all cases\r\nof dementia praecox, and says that they also occur in a few cases of\r\nmanic-depressive insanity. These findings are certainly not consistent\r\nwith those of other observers. In a review of eight hundred cases, five\r\nhundred of dementia praecox, one hundred and eighty of manic-depressive\r\ninsanity and sixty in each of the \"allied to\" groups, Simon[126] found\r\nconvulsions in less than one per cent of the total number of cases in\r\nwhich epilepsy or organic conditions could be definitely excluded. In\r\na study of 367 cases of dementia praecox Ullman[127] found convulsive\r\nmanifestations in 2.7 per cent of the total. He also reported seizures\r\nin 1.4 per cent of 340 cases of manic-depressive insanity. Kraepelin\r\nformerly held that recovery was to be expected in about eight per cent\r\nof the cases of hebephrenic dementia praecox and thirteen per cent of\r\nthe cases of katatonia (seventh edition). Notwithstanding this, he says\r\nin his eighth edition in one place:[128] \"Further investigations of a\r\nseries of observations carried on extensively and carefully for decades\r\nmust show how far the view, which is gaining in probability for myself,\r\nis correct, that permanent and complete recoveries of dementia praecox,\r\nthough they may perhaps occur, still in any event belong to the\r\nrarities.\" As Kraepelin himself suggests, the widely varying views on\r\nthis subject are due to different conceptions as to what constitutes\r\ndementia praecox and what is to be considered a cure. Certainly we\r\nare in need of further information. On June 30, 1918, there were\r\n37,352 patients in the state hospitals of New York.[129] Twenty-one\r\nthousand nine hundred and two cases were diagnosed as dementia\r\npraecox. Fifty-four of these were discharged as recovered during the\r\nyear. This represents 3.2 per cent of the 1,687 cases discharged as\r\nrecovered, 2.8 per cent of the 1,883 cases of dementia praecox admitted\r\nduring that period (first admissions) and .2 per cent of the 21,902\r\ncases of dementia praecox in the hospitals. The reports of the State\r\nPsychopathic Hospital at the University of Michigan show 1.19 per cent\r\nof recoveries in the cases of dementia praecox discharged during a\r\nperiod of eleven years. Reference is made to these discrepancies not\r\nin any spirit of criticism but for the purpose of pointing out the\r\nnecessity of utilizing such facts as may be available.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new about this suggestion. It was strenuously\r\nadvocated by Louis, the founder of one of the greatest French schools\r\nof medicine many years ago. This was referred to by his pupil and\r\nadmirer, Oliver Wendell Holmes, in his farewell address to the Harvard\r\nMedical School in 1882 in the following words: \"The 'numerical\r\nsystem,' of which Louis was the greatest advocate, if not the absolute\r\noriginator, was an attempt to substitute series of carefully recorded\r\nfacts, rigidly counted and closely compared, for those never-ending\r\nrecords of vague, unverifiable conclusions with which the classics of\r\nthe healing art were overloaded. The history of practical medicine had\r\nbeen like the story of Danaides. 'Experience' had been, from time\r\nimmemorial, pouring its flowing treasures into buckets full of holes.\"\r\n\r\nA determined effort has been made by the American Psychiatric\r\nAssociation to correlate the activities of the various state hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases and utilize the great wealth of clinical material\r\nwithin the walls of these institutions for such studies as may promote\r\nthe advancement of psychiatry. With this end in view a committee was\r\nappointed at the annual meeting at Niagara Falls in 1913 to formulate\r\na plan for the compilation of statistical data relating to mental\r\ndiseases. The conclusions reached by this committee are illustrated\r\nby the following quotation from their report in 1917: \"That the\r\nstatistical data annually compiled by the various institutions for\r\nthe insane throughout the country should be uniform in plan and scope\r\nis no longer open to question. The lack of such uniformity makes it\r\nabsolutely impossible at the present time to collect comparative\r\nstatistics concerning mental diseases in different states and\r\ncountries, and extremely difficult to secure comparative data relative\r\nto movement of patients, administration and cost of maintenance and\r\nadditions. The importance and need of some system whereby uniformity in\r\nreports would be secured have been repeatedly emphasized by officers\r\nand members of this Association, by statisticians of the United\r\nStates Census Bureau, by editors of psychiatric journals, and by\r\nadministrative officials in various states. We should know accurately\r\nthe forms of mental disease occurring in all parts of the country; we\r\nshould know the movement of patients in every hospital for the insane;\r\nwe should know the cost of maintenance of patients and the amounts\r\nspent for additions and improvements in every state hospital; we should\r\nbe able to compile annually complete data concerning these and other\r\nmatters, and compute rates and draw comparisons therefrom. Such data\r\nwould serve as the basis for constructive work in raising the standard\r\nof care of the insane, as a guide for preventive effort, and as an aid\r\nto the progress of psychiatry.\"\r\n\r\nA permanent committee on statistics has been maintained by the\r\nAssociation since 1913. The following statistical tables were\r\nofficially adopted some years ago and are now in general use: 1.\r\nGeneral information; 2. Financial statement; 3. Movement of patients;\r\n4. Nativity and parentage of first admissions; 5. Citizenship of\r\nfirst admissions; 6. Psychoses of first admissions, types as well as\r\nprincipal psychoses to be designated; 7. Race of first admissions\r\nclassified with reference to principal psychoses; 8. Age of first\r\nadmissions classified with reference to principal psychoses; 9.\r\nDegree of education of first admissions classified with reference to\r\nprincipal psychoses; 10. Environment of first admissions classified\r\nwith reference to principal psychoses; 11. Economic condition of first\r\nadmissions classified with reference to principal psychoses; 12. Use\r\nof alcohol by first admissions classified with reference to principal\r\npsychoses; 13. Marital condition of first admissions classified with\r\nreference to principal psychoses; 14. Psychoses of readmissions, types\r\nas well as principal psychoses to be designated; 15. Discharges of\r\npatients classified with reference to principal psychoses and condition\r\non discharge; 16. Causes of death of patients classified with reference\r\nto principal psychoses; 17. Age of patients at time of death classified\r\nwith reference to principal psychoses; 18. Duration of hospital life\r\nof patients dying in hospital, classified with reference to principal\r\npsychoses.\r\n\r\nAn elaborate statistical manual fully explaining the use of these\r\ntables has been furnished to the psychiatric hospitals of the country\r\nby the Association. Since this work has been undertaken the full\r\ncooperation of the institutions of the following states has been\r\nassured: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut,\r\nDelaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North\r\nDakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South\r\nCarolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia,\r\nWashington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, and the District of\r\nColumbia. Practically every state hospital in the United States is\r\nnow officially represented in this important movement. The success of\r\nthis undertaking has been largely due to the active cooperation of the\r\nNational Committee for Mental Hygiene through its Bureau of Statistics.\r\nIt should receive the enthusiastic support of all who are interested in\r\nthe future progress of modern psychiatry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the American Psychiatric Association first approached the problem\r\nof formulating a definite scheme for the collection of statistical\r\ndata relating to mental diseases it was immediately confronted with\r\nthe necessity of adopting an official classification of psychoses\r\npurely for purposes of uniformity. This undertaking, which suggested\r\nno difficulties at the outset, led to all kinds of unexpected\r\ncomplications and embarrassments. Classifications of \"insanity\" are\r\nalmost as old as the terms mania and melancholia and have been given a\r\ngrossly exaggerated importance by the space which for so many years has\r\nbeen devoted to a consideration of this subject in textbooks. This, if\r\nnothing else, appears to have been demonstrated quite clearly by the\r\ndiscussions of the last few years.\r\n\r\nA review of the literature of psychiatry shows that attempts to\r\nclassify the psychoses date back almost to the beginning of medical\r\nhistory. Hippocrates is said to have recognized three forms of mental\r\ndisorders—mania, melancholia and dementia, although there is some\r\nquestion as to his having used those terms in accordance with their\r\npresent significance. Celsus[130] also described three forms of\r\ninsanity. The first, which was accompanied by febrile symptoms, he\r\ntermed phrenitis. The second was characterized by sadness and caused by\r\nblack bile. The third was accompanied in some cases by false images,\r\nwhile in others the whole mind or judgment was impaired. The Roman law\r\ndivided the dementes or mad into two classes, the excited or violent\r\n(furiosi) and those deficient in intellect (menti capti). Aretaeus[131]\r\ndiscussed mania, melancholia and dementia, apparently regarding them\r\nas all manifestations of some one disease process. Melancholia, he\r\nsaid, \"does not affect all the faculties of the mind; the patients are\r\nsad and dismayed; they are without fever.\" He described it as only\r\nan initial stage of mania. Caelius Aurelianus[132] did not regard\r\nmelancholia as a form of insanity, \"from which disease it differs in\r\nthat the stomach chiefly suffers, while in Madness it is the head.\"\r\nGalen in his writings referred to amentia or dementia, imbecility,\r\nmania and melancholia.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century Felix Plater[133] devised the following\r\nclassification: 1. Mentis imbecillitas: Hebetudo, tarditus, oblivio,\r\nimprudentia. 2. Mentis consternatio: Somnus immodicus, carus,\r\nlethargus, apoplexia, epilepsia, convulsio, catalepsis, ecstasis.\r\n3. Mentis alienatio: Stultitas, temulentia, amor, melancholia,\r\nhypochondriacus morbus, mania, hydrophobia, phrenitis, saltus viti.\r\n4. Mentis defatigatio: Vigiles, insomnia. Linnaeus[134] in 1763 called\r\nhis fifth class of diseases Mentales, divided into three orders:\r\nIdeales, Imaginarii and Pathetici. Sauvages in the same year included\r\nHallucinationes, Morositates and Deliria under the heading of Vesaniae\r\nin his \"Nosologia Methodica.\" Vogel[134] in 1764 divided Paranoiae\r\ninto mania, melancholia, and amentia. Cullen in 1772 included insanity\r\nor the Vesaniae in the neuroses, divided into four groups—Amentia,\r\nMelancholia, Mania and Oneirodinia. He described eight varieties of\r\nmelancholia and three of mania. Oneirodinia included somnambulism and\r\nnightmare. According to Jelliffe, Plocquet described six varieties of\r\ndelirium in his treatise on paranoia in 1772. Pinel in 1791 limited\r\nhimself to four classes of insanity—mania, melancholia, dementia\r\nand idiotism. He looked upon melancholia as a delirium exclusively\r\ndirected upon one object or series of objects and accompanied by\r\nsadness. Idiotism was an advanced form of dementia. Esquirol in 1838\r\nmodified Pinel's scheme somewhat and described Lypemania, Monomania,\r\nMania, Dementia and Imbecility or Idiocy. The active discussion of\r\nclassifications of various kinds led Pritchard[135] to make the\r\nfollowing interesting comment in 1822: \"I cannot conceive anything\r\nmore preposterously absurd than the attempt to classify diseases with\r\nall the divisions and technology of a botanical or zoological system,\r\nand to force what is essentially disorder and confusion to assume the\r\nappearance of that order and symmetry which nature displays in the\r\narrangement of the organized world. An aetiological classification\r\nis the only mode of terminology and arrangement that can be of any\r\npractical advantage, and that is all that we have to consult.\"\r\nHe nevertheless published a classification of his own which was\r\nessentially psychological in principle, although containing nothing new.\r\n\r\nThe German school of this time was exceedingly prolific in the\r\nproduction of classifications, as will be shown by the following\r\ninteresting and elaborate scheme of Flemming's[136] published in 1844:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FAMILY-AMENTIA—MENTAL DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\n _First Group_—Infirmitas (Feeblemindedness).\r\n\r\n     Varieties:\r\n\r\n     A.

Dys. mutabilis (changeable or alternating)\r\n       2. Dys. sparsa (apathica)—General dysthymia (melancholia attonita).\r\n\r\n     _Second Order_:—Vesania anoëtos or Anoësia—Deliria of various forms.\r\n\r\n     Varieties:\r\n\r\n     A. According to types:\r\n       1. Anoësia transitoria or subita (acute)\r\n       Species:\r\n            a. A. e febre—fever delirium\r\n            b. A. e potu—alcoholism\r\n            c.

M. s. e mordo occulto—amentia occulta, which includes the\r\n               above forms.\r\n       2. Mania continua—chronic mania\r\n       3. Mania remittens—remittent mania\r\n\r\n     B. According to degree:\r\n       1. Mania adstricta seu instinctiva—partial or limited mania. (Mania\r\n          sine delirio of Pinel.) (Moral insanity, monomania.)\r\n       2. Mania sparsa—general mania.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is said to have been based on Jacobi's somato-aetiological\r\ntheory (1830) that \"there is no disease of the mind existing as\r\nsuch, but that insanity exists solely as the consequence of disease,\r\neither functional or organic, in some parts of the body system.\"\r\nHeinroth[137] saw in the various mental disorders a disturbance of one\r\nor the other of the normal functions of the mind which he divided into\r\nthree classes. \"If the cause of derangement is in relation to one of\r\nthese manifestations of mental existence—and to one or another it\r\nmust belong, since the mind is ever occupied with phenomena related\r\nto one out of the three classes—we have only to inquire to which\r\nmodification the disorder actually refers itself, or whether it affects\r\nthe feelings, the understanding, or the will. Since one of these has\r\npossession of our consciousness, or is at least predominant at every\r\npoint of time, whichever function of the mind happens to be that which\r\nis falling into disorder, by it the form of insanity is determined.\"\r\nGriesinger[138] in 1845, on the other hand, was of the opinion that\r\nall classifications must in the end return to the principal forms\r\npreviously described—mania, melancholia and dementia. In 1860 Morel\r\nannounced his well-known classification: Hereditary Insanity, which\r\nincluded imbecility and idiocy; Toxic Insanity (alcohol, lead, mercury,\r\netc., as well as cretinism); Insanity produced by the transformation\r\nof other diseases (hysterical, epileptic, hypochondriacal); Idiopathic\r\nInsanity (general paresis, etc.); Sympathetic Insanity, and Dementia,\r\n\"a terminative state.\"\r\n\r\nMaudsley spoke of Affective or Pathetic, and Ideational Insanity.\r\nThe former was divided into maniacal perversion, melancholic\r\ndepression and moral alienation. The latter included general forms\r\n(mania or melancholia), partial forms (monomania or melancholia),\r\ndementia (primary and secondary), general paralysis and imbecility.\r\nRégis described five forms of mania, five of melancholia, two of\r\ninsanity of double form, and a systematized progressive insanity.\r\nIn addition to these, he divided constitutional insanity into two\r\ngroups—the degeneracy of evolution and the degeneracy of involution.\r\nKrafft-Ebing[139] included melancholia, mania, primary dementia,\r\nexhaustion psychoses and terminal conditions in his group of\r\npsychoneuroses. Under the heading of degenerative forms he described\r\nconstitutional affective insanity, paranoia and periodical insanity.\r\nNeurasthenic, epileptic, hysterical and hypochondriacal psychoses were\r\ngrouped together under the constitutional neuroses. In addition to\r\nthis he described chronic intoxications, organic brain diseases and\r\narrested development. At a meeting of the International Congress of\r\nAlienists in 1889 the following classification was adopted: 1. Mania;\r\n2. Melancholia; 3. Periodical Insanity; 4. Progressive Systematical\r\nInsanity; 5. Dementia; 6. Organic and Senile Dementia; 7. General\r\nParalysis; 8. Insane Neurosis (hysteria, epilepsy, hypochondriasis,\r\netc.); 9. Toxic Insanity; 10. Moral and Impulsive Insanity; and 11.\r\nIdiocy. Ziehen[140] had a classification scheme which represented an\r\nadvance in some respects. Mania and melancholia were described as\r\naffective psychoses, and paranoia as an intellectual disorder. He also\r\nreferred to mixed or combined forms. Imbecility, general paresis,\r\nterminal deteriorations, etc., were grouped together under the general\r\nheading of psychoses with intellectual defects.\r\n\r\nThe British Medico-Psychological Association has had an official\r\nclassification for many years. This was quoted by Savage[141] in 1907 as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n 1. Congenital or infantile mental deficiency (idiocy or imbecility)\r\n      occurring as early in life as it can be observed:\r\n        (1) Intellectual\r\n              a. Without epilepsy\r\n              b. With epilepsy\r\n        (2) Moral\r\n 2. Insanity arising later in life:\r\n        (1) Insanity with epilepsy\r\n        (2) General paralysis of the insane\r\n        (3) Insanity with the grosser brain lesions\r\n        (4) Acute delirium (acute delirious mania)\r\n        (5) Confusional insanity\r\n        (6) Stupor\r\n        (7) Primary dementia\r\n        (8) Mania\r\n              a. Recent\r\n              b. Chronic\r\n              c. Recurrent\r\n        (9) Melancholia\r\n              a. Recent\r\n              b. Chronic\r\n              c. Recurrent\r\n       (10) Alternating Insanity\r\n       (11) Delusional Insanity\r\n              a. Systematized\r\n              b. Non-systematized\r\n       (12) Volitional Insanity\r\n              a. Impulse\r\n              b. Obsession\r\n              c. Doubt\r\n        (13) Moral Insanity\r\n        (14) Dementia\r\n              a. Secondary or terminal\r\n              b. Senile\r\n\r\nAn elaborate classification was also officially adopted by the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians of England[142] about the same time. This\r\nrecognized seven varieties of mania, seven of melancholia and six of\r\ndementia. The subject of classifications would not be complete without\r\na reference to Kraepelin. His eighth edition (1910-1915) showed the\r\nfollowing:—\r\n\r\n  1. Psychoses accompanying Injuries to the Brain:\r\n       Concussion\r\n       Traumatic delirium\r\n       Traumatic epilepsy\r\n       Traumatic enfeeblement\r\n\r\n  2.

Defective Mental Development (oligophrenia)\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the American Medico-Psychological Association\r\nin 1869 Nichols called attention to the statistical studies proposed\r\nby the International Congress of Alienists in 1867. As a result of\r\nhis efforts a series of twenty-one statistical tables was prepared\r\nand used unofficially for several years, although never formally\r\nadopted. A committee reported again on this subject in 1896, but\r\nwithout any definite action being taken. The Italian psychiatrists have\r\nhad a classification which has been in general use by them for some\r\ntime. Interest in this subject has been stimulated by the frequent\r\npublications of Kraepelin during the last thirty years. Meyer and Hoch\r\nhave been largely responsible for bringing his work to the attention\r\nof the profession in this country, and Kraepelin's classification with\r\nsome modifications has come into very general use here. It was not\r\nuntil the publication of its twenty-first annual report in 1909 that\r\nthe New York State Commission in Lunacy adopted a modern classification\r\nof psychoses.\r\n\r\nAt that time there were practically as many different forms of\r\nstatistical reports in the United States as there were hospitals. In\r\nthe meanwhile almost every textbook published during the last fifty\r\nyears has announced a new classification of mental diseases. They have\r\nbeen based on etiology, pathology, symptomatology and psychology.\r\nEnglish, French, German, Italian and American classifications\r\nhave appeared, each representing, as a rule, different schools of\r\npsychiatry. Kempf[143] would discard the term psychosis altogether\r\nand speak only of neuroses as \"more consistent with the integrative\r\nfunctions of the nervous system.\" For diagnostic purposes he proposes\r\nto separate the benign from the pernicious processes and classify them\r\naccording to their psychological mechanisms as suppression, repression,\r\ncompensatory, regression and dissociation neuroses. The easiest way\r\nout of all these difficulties, as Southard[144] has said, would be \"to\r\ndeny the existence of entities in mental disease. There are two forms\r\nof this contention; first, that mental disease is nothing more or less\r\nthan insanity, an entity itself, a genus with but one species, or\r\nsecondly, that all victims of mental disease are individually to be\r\nprovided with entities, that is, all examples of mental disease are sui\r\ngeneris. The development of psychiatry has killed the former contention\r\nstone dead, but the latter contention still flourishes to an extent\r\namong those who overstress the individual factor. And this latter\r\ncontention is bolstered up by the existence of so many psychopathic\r\npatients of whom a diagnosis cannot be rendered for practical or\r\ntheoretical reasons. However, there are no really consistent advocates\r\nof the sui generis plan of classification.\" It is interesting to\r\nnote that he concedes ... \"that the American Medico-Psychological\r\nAssociation's classification, adopted as it has been by a great number\r\nof American institutions and by the United States Government for war\r\npurposes, is a reasonably good classification and aware that its\r\nconstituent elements fairly well correspond with what all American\r\npsychiatrists agree upon.\"\r\n\r\nSouthard[145] raises the question as to how this classification can\r\nbe used for diagnostic purposes. He answers this query by suggesting\r\n\"A key to the practical grouping of mental diseases\"[146] ... \"to be\r\nfollowed, when necessary, like a botanical key in the search for\r\nthe classification of a plant.\"... \"It is a key to study and not an\r\nanalytical classification with any pretence to finality.\"... \"The plan\r\nis not so much an excursion into nosology as an essay in the technique\r\nof psychiatric diagnosis for the tyro.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem presenting itself in the adoption of a classification\r\npurely for statistical purposes was not a question of a scientific\r\ngrouping of the psychoses based on either etiological, anatomical,\r\npathological, clinical or prognostic considerations. It was a question\r\nof compiling a tabulation or list of clinical entities recognized\r\ngenerally by American psychiatrists, subject to such changes and\r\nmodifications as may be necessary to make it conform to accepted\r\nstandards. As a matter of fact, no adequate reason for a classification\r\nof mental diseases for any other than statistical purposes has even\r\nbeen advanced by the authors of our textbooks on psychiatry. They\r\ndo not contribute anything of value whatever to our knowledge of\r\nsymptomatology, diagnosis or treatment. Practically the only point\r\non which the writers of our textbooks agree is that there is no one\r\nfundamental principle upon which a satisfactory classification can be\r\nbased. It is unfortunate that tradition seems to demand the serious\r\nconsideration of a problem which many believe admits of no solution and\r\nwhich would mean little or nothing to the future of psychiatry if it\r\nwere solved. The views of the Committee on Statistics are shown by a\r\nquotation from the report made to the Association at its meeting in\r\nNew York in 1917:—\"Your Committee feels that the first essential\r\nof a uniform system of statistics in hospitals for the insane is a\r\ngenerally recognized nomenclature of mental diseases. The present\r\ncondition with respect to the classification of mental diseases is\r\nchaotic. Some states use no well-defined classification. In others the\r\nclassifications used are similar in many respects but differ enough\r\nto prevent accurate comparisons. Some states have adopted a uniform\r\nsystem, while others leave the matter entirely to the individual\r\nhospitals. This condition of affairs discredits the science of\r\npsychiatry and reflects unfavorably upon our Association, which should\r\nserve as a correlating and standardizing agency for the whole country.\r\nThe large task of your Committee therefore has been the formulation of\r\na classification which it could unanimously recommend for adoption by\r\nthe Association. The task was accomplished only after several prolonged\r\nconferences at which classifications now in use in various states\r\nand countries, and the recommendations of leading psychiatrists were\r\nconsidered. The classification finally adopted is simple, comprehensive\r\nand complete; it copies no other classification but includes the strong\r\nfeatures of many others; it meets the demands of the best modern\r\npsychiatry but does not slavishly follow any single system. In short,\r\nyour Committee has endeavored to formulate a classification that could\r\nbe easily used in every hospital for the insane in this country and\r\nthat would meet the scientific demands of the present day.\"\r\n\r\nSince the compilation of statistical data relating to the various\r\nactivities of the hospitals for mental diseases in this country was\r\ndefinitely decided upon by the Association at its meeting in 1913,\r\nthe membership of the Committee on Statistics has from time to time\r\nincluded the following:—Dr. Thomas W. Salmon, Medical Director,\r\nNational Committee for Mental Hygiene; Dr. Owen Copp, Physician in\r\nChief and Superintendent, Pennsylvania Hospital, Department for\r\nNervous and Mental Diseases; Dr. E. Stanley Abbot, Medical Director,\r\nPublic Charities Association of Pennsylvania; Dr. Henry A. Cotton,\r\nMedical Director, New Jersey State Hospital, Trenton; Dr. L. Vernon\r\nBriggs, Boston, former member of the Massachusetts State Board of\r\nInsanity; Dr. Adolf Meyer, Professor of Psychiatry, Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity; Dr. Albert M. Barrett, Professor of Psychiatry and\r\nNeurology, University of Michigan; Dr. George H. Kirby, Director\r\nof the Psychiatric Institute, New York City; Dr. Samuel T. Orton,\r\nProfessor of Psychiatry and Director of the Psychopathic Hospital,\r\nUniversity of Iowa; Dr. Frankwood E. Williams, Associate Medical\r\nDirector, National Committee for Mental Hygiene; Dr. Elmer E. Southard,\r\nDirector of the Massachusetts State Psychiatric Institute; Dr. C.\r\nMacfie Campbell, Director of the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, and the\r\nwriter. Associated with the committee officially were: Dr. August Hoch,\r\nformerly Director of the Psychiatric Institute, New York; Dr. H. M.\r\nPollock, Statistician of the New York State Hospital Commission; Miss\r\nEdith M. Furbush, Statistician of the National Committee for Mental\r\nHygiene, and various others.\r\n\r\nThe Association's classification of mental diseases at this time (1921)\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. Traumatic psychoses:\r\n      (a) Traumatic delirium\r\n      (b) Traumatic constitution\r\n      (c) Post-traumatic mental enfeeblement (dementia)\r\n      (d) Other types\r\n 2.

Concussion of the brain, referred to in the writings of\r\nHippocrates, Galen and Celsus, was first studied postmortem in 1705 by\r\nLittré. It is now discussed in all textbooks on surgery. Usually milder\r\nforms are described with evidences of shock or collapse—a brief period\r\nof unconsciousness, partial or complete, with visual and auditory\r\ndisturbances, dizziness, muscular relaxation or temporary paralysis,\r\nrespiratory symptoms, dilated pupils, weakness of the pulse, lowered\r\ntemperature, etc. Delirium and stupor or coma are associated with more\r\nsevere injuries. If the cortex is lacerated, twitchings or convulsions\r\noften occur. Returning consciousness shows various reactions—headache,\r\nvomiting, amnesia, etc., and may be succeeded by convulsions,\r\nencephalitis or mental disturbances. DaCosta[147] says that some cases\r\nare followed by a complete change in the personality, forgetfulness,\r\nheadache, insomnia, attacks of depression, lassitude and vertigo with\r\nincreased susceptibility to alcohol, heat and physical exertion.\r\nAcute surgical injuries, and compression due to growths, hemorrhages,\r\nfractures, etc., have been exhaustively studied. Compression has been\r\ndifferentiated surgically[148] by the later appearance of a gradual\r\nunconsciousness, more definite paralysis, usually on the side opposite the\r\ninjury, slow pulse and stertorous respirations, unequal immobile\r\npupils, choked disc, convulsive movements, etc. Traumatic encephalitis\r\nand meningitis have long been recognized but present no definitely\r\ncharacteristic symptoms which distinguish them from simple inflammatory\r\nreactions.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest accurate descriptions of brain injury associated\r\nwith mental symptoms was that of the well-known \"crowbar\" case. It will\r\nbe recalled that while blasting in Vermont in 1848 a man by the name of\r\nGage had an iron bar driven through the frontal region of his skull,\r\nmaking a complete recovery and living for over twelve years after\r\nthe accident. An autopsy showed that only the prefrontal cortex was\r\ninvolved. A very interesting report on his mental condition was made by\r\nDr. John M. Harlow:[149] \"His contractors, who regarded him as the most\r\nefficient and capable foreman in their employ previous to his injury,\r\nconsidered the change in his mind so marked that they could not give\r\nhim his place again. The equilibrium, or balance, so to speak, between\r\nhis intellectual faculties and animal propensities seems to have been\r\ndestroyed. He is fitful, irreverent, indulging at times in the grossest\r\nprofanity (which was not previously his custom), manifesting but little\r\ndeference for his fellows, impatient of restraint or advice when it\r\nconflicts with his desires, at times pertinaciously obstinate yet\r\ncapricious and vacillating, devising many plans of future operations,\r\nwhich are no sooner arranged than they are abandoned in turn for others\r\nappearing more feasible. A child in his intellectual capacity and\r\nmanifestations, he had the animal passions of a strong man. Previous\r\nto his injury, though untrained in the schools, he possessed a well\r\nbalanced mind, and was looked upon by those who knew him as a shrewd,\r\nsmart business man, very energetic and persistent in executing all his\r\nplans of operation. In this regard his mind was radically changed, so\r\ndecidedly that his friends and acquaintances said he was 'no longer\r\nGage.'\"\r\n\r\nVarious other cases reported have established the fact that mental\r\ndeterioration usually follows extensive injuries to the frontal lobes.\r\nWitmer[150] summarizes this as consisting of \"slight intellectual\r\ndegradation, moral and emotional perversion, deficiency of attention,\r\nand volitional inefficiency.\"\r\n\r\nA work by Ericksen in 1866 on \"Railway Injuries to the Nervous\r\nSystem\" and Page's book in 1882 on \"Injuries of the Spine\" pointed\r\nthe way to an extensive study of the so-called traumatic neuroses.\r\nThis characterization of the functional disturbances of the nervous\r\nsystem following injuries was apparently the result of a monograph by\r\nOppenheim on that subject in 1889. They had previously been considered\r\nas purely organic in origin. Traumatic hysteria was discussed very\r\nfully at various times by Charcot, whose work is so well known as to\r\nrequire no comment. In 1892 Friedmann described a vasomotor complex\r\ndue to concussion. This is accompanied by such symptoms as headache,\r\ndizziness, loss of capacity for both physical and mental work with\r\nan increased fatigability, irritability, memory defects, and changes\r\nin personality, such as sensitiveness and eccentricity with a marked\r\nintolerance to alcohol. This condition appears some time after the\r\nsymptoms of concussion and shock have subsided and may last for some\r\nmonths. Friedmann looked upon this as purely a vasomotor disturbance.\r\nIt is probably an important factor, in some cases at least, of\r\n\"shell shock\". Traumatic epilepsy may result from foci of softening\r\nor other local areas of injury to the brain. Neurasthenia, hysteria\r\nand other neuroses are now generally looked upon as being essentially\r\nfunctional and not organic in origin, although they may follow a\r\ntrauma. The simulation of these conditions has led to a great deal of\r\ndiscussion, notwithstanding the fact that Oppenheim found them in only\r\nabout four per cent of his cases. Köppen (1897) made a very elaborate\r\nstudy of the postmortem lesions in the \"traumatic neuroses\". He found\r\nthat violence to the skull often resulted in small injuries at the\r\nbase of the frontal area, at the apices of the parietal lobes or in\r\nthe occipital region. The pathological changes involved represented\r\nlocalized encephalitis with hemorrhagic infiltration. Foci of softening\r\nwere often found in the cerebral cortex. He noted coma and convulsions\r\nwith only minute areas of destruction of the basal cortex at autopsy.\r\nThis would indicate a severe irritation, probably due to circulatory\r\ndisturbances. The resulting symptoms he thought were very likely to be\r\nconfused with general paresis. In cases of extreme dementia following\r\ntraumatism he often found no pathological lesion other than a cicatrix\r\nin the cerebral cortex.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important contributions to the literature of traumatism\r\nas associated with psychoses was made by Adolf Meyer[151] in 1903.\r\nNotwithstanding the statements of such observers as Savage, appearing\r\nas late as 1905, he expressed the opinion that traumatism and general\r\nparesis are not directly related except that injuries may rarely act as\r\nprecipitating factors. He does not expect to find psychoses resulting\r\nfrom small lacerations or other similar lesions in the cortex. As a\r\nresult of his observations Meyer[152] described the following forms of\r\ntraumatic disorders:—\r\n\r\n 1. The direct post-traumatic deliria with the following subdivisions:\r\n     a. Preeminently febrile reactions;\r\n     b. The delirium nervosum of Dupuytren, not differing from deliria\r\n         after operations, injuries, etc.;\r\n     c. The delirium of slow evolution of coma, with or without alcoholic\r\n         basis;\r\n     d. Forms of protracted deliria, usually with numerous tabulations,\r\n         etc. (with or without alcoholic or senile basis).\r\n\r\n 2. The post-traumatic constitution:\r\n     a. Types with mere facilitation of reaction to alcohol, grippe, etc.;\r\n     b. Types with vasomotor neurosis;\r\n     c. Types with explosive diathesis;\r\n     d. Types with hysteroid or epileptoid episodes, with or without\r\n         convulsions (such as most reflex psychoses);\r\n     e. Types of paranoic development.\r\n\r\n 3. The traumatic defect conditions:\r\n     a. Primary defects allied to aphasia;\r\n     b. Secondary deterioration in connection with epilepsy;\r\n     c. Terminal deterioration due to progressive alterations of the\r\n         primarily injured parts, with or without arteriosclerosis.\r\n\r\n 4. Psychoses in which trauma is merely a contributing factor:\r\n     a. General paralysis, with or without traumatic stigmata;\r\n     b. Manic-depressive and other transitory psychoses, catatonic\r\n         deterioration and paranoic conditions, with or without traumatic\r\n         stigmata.\r\n\r\n 5. Traumatic psychoses from injury not directly affecting the head.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature perhaps of this classification is the\r\npost-traumatic constitution. Meyer[153] quotes Köppen's excellent\r\ndescription of this condition as follows:—\"Men who have suffered from\r\na cranial lesion in which there has been a severe damage of the brain,\r\nwith or without an injury to the cranial bones, on their recovery from\r\nthe immediate results complain especially of all kinds of sensations\r\nin the head, which they describe either as pain or as pressure with\r\nfeeling of crawling or dullness of the head, more or less definitely\r\nlocated at the point where they were hit. They frequently become\r\ndizzy, and at times even faint for a short time without any epileptic\r\nattack. Although slight attacks of dizziness may recur frequently,\r\nepilepsy with typical attacks need not develop. There is further in our\r\npatients a great irritability and nervosity. The formerly good-natured\r\nor even-tempered persons become irascible, hard to get along with;\r\nformerly conscientious fathers cease to care for their family. The\r\nirritability at times increases to excessive violence in which actions\r\noccur of which they have no remembrance; the nervous system is not only\r\nunder the influence of psychic irritation but especially susceptible\r\nto the influence of alcohol or tobacco, in even small quantities. The\r\nworking capacity of our patients is very poor. It suffers variously,\r\nalthough such individuals often give an impression of perfect capacity;\r\nand since the morbid symptoms are essentially subjective, they always\r\narouse doubts whether they could not do something at least, even if\r\nthey are unable to work in a noisy shop or on a high scaffolding. It\r\nis, however, certain that the patients are very forgetful; in giving\r\norders or doing errands they make the most incredible blunders;\r\nfrequently everything must be written down. Their capacity for thought\r\nhas suffered, as is sometimes shown, especially in the great slowness\r\nof thought. These patients are unable to concentrate their attention,\r\nnot even in occupations which serve for mere entertainment, such as\r\nreading or playing cards. They like best to brood unoccupied; even\r\nconversation is rather obnoxious. This point is so characteristic that\r\nit gives a certain means of distinction from simulation, which as a\r\nrule does not interfere with taking part in the conversations and\r\npleasures of the ward and playing at cards, which means as a rule too\r\nmuch of an effort for the brain of actual sufferers. The patients are\r\nusually advised to take light physical work, but even there they are\r\nperfectly useless. Excessive sensitiveness of their head obliges them\r\nto avoid all work which is connected with sudden jerks, bending over is\r\nespecially troublesome; and there is hardly any physical work in which\r\nthis can be avoided; the blood rushes to the head, headache increases,\r\ndizziness sets in and the work stops. Patients feel best when in the\r\nopen air, inactive and undisturbed. There are but few objective signs,\r\nsuch as increase of pulse, flushing of the face, dermatographia,\r\ntrembling and uncertainty in the Romberg position, such as is shown\r\nin all general nervosity. But the complaints are so exceedingly\r\nuniform that the uniformity of the subjective complaints justifies the\r\nconclusion that they are well founded. The picture thus is briefly\r\nthat of a mental weakness shown by easy fatigue, slowness of thought,\r\ninability to keep impressions, irritability, and a great number of\r\nunpleasant sensations, before all headaches and dizziness.\"\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly interesting to note that Schläger in discussing\r\ndisorders resulting from concussion of the brain, in 1857, as quoted by\r\nGriesinger,[154] makes the following comment on these cases:—\"Very often\r\nthe character and disposition changes; in 20 cases great irascibility,\r\nan angry, passionate manner even to the most violent outbursts\r\nof temper was remarked—less frequently over-estimation of self,\r\nprodigality, restlessness, disquietude; in 14 cases there were attempts\r\nat suicide, frequently weakness of memory, confusion.\" Meyer found,\r\nfurthermore, in his analysis \"all the possible degrees of episodes\r\nof more or less dazing and dream states; from a temporary dazed\r\nfeeling to episodes of hysteriform or epileptoid absences. Apart from\r\nthe subjective feeling of haziness, the characteristic trait is the\r\noccurrence of complete dream interpretations and peculiar fabrications,\r\nwhich color the primary traumatic insanity as well as the subacute and\r\nepisodic types, and even the paranoic type.\"\r\n\r\nKraepelin[155] describes concussion and compression, traumatic\r\ndelirium, traumatic epilepsy and traumatic mental enfeeblement. He\r\nfinds these conditions due to concussion, compression or injury to\r\nthe brain substance either at the site of traumatism or at some\r\npoint opposite. There may be contusions, lacerations of the brain\r\ntissue or hemorrhages, usually in the frontal, occipital or parietal\r\nregions. Injuries to the cortex are not demonstrable in all cases. The\r\ncirculatory disturbances he considers an important factor and thinks\r\nthat they account for smaller lesions of the cerebral tissue in many\r\ninstances where no gross changes are apparent. More or less disturbance\r\nof consciousness is to be expected in these conditions. The patient is\r\nsomewhat dull, drowsy, clumsy, forgetful and absentminded. Memory is\r\nsometimes much affected. In more severe cases there is a complete loss\r\nof consciousness which may last a few minutes only or be a matter of\r\nhours or days. On waking, the patient is bewildered and confused, with\r\na marked disturbance of apprehension. Perception is involved as in the\r\nrecognition of complicated pictures or the understanding of long and\r\ndetailed statements. A clear comprehension of events and surroundings\r\nis lacking. The patients may know that they are in a hospital without\r\nknowing what hospital it is or why they are there and are unable to\r\nrecognize persons around them. Occasionally hallucinations of sight\r\nor of hearing occur. At times delusional ideas are expressed, usually\r\nof a depressive type. They have no realization whatever of their own\r\ncondition. The memory disturbance may take the form of a Korsakow's\r\ncomplex. Memory gaps appear sometimes for events just before the\r\naccident and in other cases cover long periods of time. While as a rule\r\nevents of the remote past are retained, recent impressions are quickly\r\nlost. They cannot repeat what is read to them, do not remember\r\nthe names of persons about them, and sometimes show evidence of\r\nfalsification of memory with fabrication. All idea as to time is\r\nusually lost. Mental reactions become noticeably difficult. The patient\r\nis distractible, cannot count accurately, has difficulty in repeating\r\ndates and numbers and forms no correct judgment as to his own personal\r\naffairs. Many express themselves, however, on the other hand, with\r\ngreat facility and readiness. Some show considerable fatigability.\r\nThe mood is often elated with a tendency to facetiousness, although\r\nfrequently tearful and anxious, particularly at night. Irritable,\r\nfaultfinding trends usually appear later. As a rule they are talkative,\r\nrestless, sensitive, abusive or even insolent. Bonhöffer has reported\r\nstereotypies as well as stuporous and other catatonic types. In speech\r\nthe patients often become incoherent, make mistakes, forget words\r\nor coin new ones. Similar mistakes appear in reading and writing.\r\nAsymbolism and parapraxia are observed. Residual symptoms of the brain\r\ninjury are headaches, dizziness, fainting attacks and convulsions. The\r\npupils are contracted and do not react properly to light. The pulse is\r\nfrequently very slow.\r\n\r\nIn fractures at the base of the brain there is likely to be a\r\nhemorrhage from the ears and deafness from injuries to the labyrinth.\r\nInvolvement of the pyramidal tracts may cause unilateral weakness or\r\neven paralysis, with increased knee-jerks and occasionally a Babinski\r\nreflex. Usually the mental symptoms appear promptly after the injury.\r\nSometimes, however, there is for a while only a slight dulness.\r\nThe patients are unable to go about the house unassisted, and act\r\npeculiarly, becoming clouded or delirious after a few hours or days.\r\nImprovement begins to show itself in a few weeks as a rule unless\r\nsome intercurrent affection intervenes, but the symptoms may persist\r\nfor several months. Meningitis or abscess formation often causes\r\ndeath. These developments are usually indicated by a marked delirium\r\nor coma. There may also be paralysis, convulsions, disturbances of\r\nspeech, rise of temperature, etc. The subsidence of active delirious\r\nsymptoms is sometimes succeeded by Kraepelin's traumatic neurosis.\r\nFollowing the traumatic delirium or concussion psychosis described,\r\nmental enfeeblement sometimes appears. Clouding of consciousness is\r\nnot a factor in this condition. There is usually a complete change\r\nin the psychic personality. The patients tire easily, are incapable\r\nof sustained mental efforts, forgetful, absentminded, complain\r\nof dizziness, dulness, noises in the ears, pressure in the head,\r\nmigraine, palpitation, etc. Or they may be irritable, with outbursts\r\nof anger often alternating with apathy. Some are depressed, anxious or\r\nhypochondriacal. There is a greatly increased susceptibility to alcohol\r\nand intoxication often induces excitements, epileptiform attacks,\r\nstupors or rarely actual dreamstates.\r\n\r\nWildermuth found a history of traumatism in 3.8 per cent of his cases\r\nof epilepsy. The statistics of the German Army show 4.2 per cent. When\r\nthe convulsive manifestations are in the foreground and the picture\r\nis one of traumatic epilepsy, advanced mental deterioration may be\r\nexhibited, with impairment of mental capacity and disturbance of\r\nmemory. These cases remain apathetic, forgetful, dull, irritable and\r\nchildish. At autopsy there are often no evidences of any great injury\r\nto the brain. Occasionally extensive areas of softening may, however,\r\nbe found. Usually there is a widespread destruction of the nerve cells\r\nand their associated fibres. There is often a proliferation of the\r\nglia, with changes in the vessel walls which may be thickened and\r\ndilated, with capillary hemorrhages and softenings. Extensive areas\r\nof the cortex may be involved. Bleuler's description of the traumatic\r\npsychoses is not essentially different from that of Kraepelin.\r\n\r\nThe differentiation of these conditions as suggested in the statistical\r\nmanual of the American Psychiatric Association is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The diagnosis should be restricted to mental disorders arising as a\r\ndirect or obvious consequence of a brain (or head) injury producing\r\npsychotic symptoms of a fairly characteristic kind. The amount of\r\ndamage to the brain may vary from an extensive destruction of tissue\r\nto simple concussion or physical shock with or without fracture of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\n\"Manic-depressive psychoses, general paralysis, dementia praecox, and\r\nother mental disorders in which trauma may act as a contributory or\r\nprecipitating cause, should not be included in this group.\r\n\r\n\"The following are the most common clinical types of traumatic\r\npsychosis and should be specified in the statistical record of the\r\nhospital:—\r\n\r\n\"(a) Traumatic delirium: This may take the form of an acute delirium\r\n(concussion delirium), or a more protracted delirium resembling the\r\nKorsakow mental complex.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Traumatic constitution: Characterized by a gradual post-traumatic\r\nchange in disposition with vasomotor instability, headaches,\r\nfatigability, irritability or explosive emotional reactions; usually\r\nhyper-sensitiveness to alcohol, and in some cases development of\r\nparanoid, hysteroid, or epileptoid symptoms.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Post-traumatic mental enfeeblement (dementia): Varying degrees of\r\nmental reduction with or without aphasic symptoms, epileptiform attacks\r\nor development of a cerebral arteriosclerosis.\r\n\r\n\"(d) Other types.\"\r\n\r\nWe have not as yet, unfortunately, sufficient data at our disposal to\r\nwarrant intelligent conclusions as to the frequency of the various\r\nforms of traumatic psychoses. One hundred and twenty-seven cases\r\nreported from the New York state hospitals during a period of six years\r\nwere classified as follows:—\r\n\r\n        _Form_                       _Number_  _Per cent_\r\n\r\n  Traumatic delirium                    38        29.32\r\n  Traumatic constitution                32        25.19\r\n  Post traumatic mental enfeeblement    32        25.19\r\n  Others, not specified                 25        19.70\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly with a more definite understanding as to the delimitation\r\nof these different conditions more complete information will be\r\navailable later. We are nevertheless justified in feeling that the\r\nfrequency of the traumatic psychoses considered as a group can be\r\ndetermined with a fair degree of accuracy. Of 49,640 first admissions\r\nto the New York hospitals during a period of eight years, 161, or .32\r\nper cent, were definitely ascribed to traumatism. Twenty-one other\r\nhospitals in fourteen different states reported forty-five cases of\r\ntraumatic psychoses (.24 per cent) in 18,336 admissions. Two hundred\r\nand seventeen cases (.3 per cent) have therefore been reported in a\r\ntotal of 70,987 first admissions to forty-eight state hospitals for\r\nmental diseases in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE SENILE PSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nNever until very recently has any great importance been attached to the\r\npsychoses due solely to age or much interest manifested in them. These\r\nforms of insanity in the majority of our textbooks have appeared only\r\nunder the designation of senile dementia. This is true of the earlier\r\neditions of Krafft-Ebing and many other writers. Clouston referred to\r\nsenile dementia as one of four varieties of mental enfeeblement. \"Most\r\ncases,\"[156] he says, \"fall under three varieties. The first has as its\r\nchief characteristics depression and lethargy. The second consists\r\nchiefly of excitement, sometimes with a certain exaltation, but always\r\nwith irritability, restlessness, unreason, suspicion, and change of\r\naffection. The third variety consists chiefly of the abolition of\r\nmind in all its forms, or senile dementia, and of complete dotage. In\r\nsome cases those three varieties form three different stages in the\r\nsame case. In others they do not change.\" Régis, in a work on mental\r\nmedicine covering 668 pages in all, devoted two and one-half pages to\r\na consideration of the insanity of old age. Ziehen[157] in 1894 included\r\n\"dementia senilis\" with general paralysis, epileptic, alcoholic and\r\nterminal deteriorations in his group of \"acquired defect psychoses\" and\r\ncharacterized it as \"a chronic organic psychosis of advanced years,\r\nthe principal symptom of which is a progressive intelligence defect.\"\r\nExcitements, depressions, confusional states, deliria, deteriorations,\r\nmental mechanisms of any and all kinds, occurring late in life,\r\nwere usually disposed of without any effort at differentiation by\r\nthe very convenient method of relegating them to the obscure domain\r\nof senile dementia. This is a field which on exploration has been\r\nfound to be one of considerable interest. It has been pointed out\r\nthat manic-depressive insanity not infrequently occurs in persons of\r\nadvanced age. Uncomplicated alcoholic psychoses are not at all rare.\r\nBleuler has advanced the theory that dementia praecox and certain of\r\nthe senile conditions are similar if not identical processes. General\r\nparesis has been demonstrated in the later periods of life by modern\r\nlaboratory methods and the diagnosis confirmed at autopsy. Cerebral\r\nsyphilis certainly cannot be left out of consideration. Toxic deliria\r\nare encountered now and then. Even the psychoneuroses are possibilities.\r\n\r\nKraepelin first established the importance of involution melancholia\r\nas a form of depression warranting separate consideration. The anxiety\r\npsychoses occurring late in life have since been made the subject of\r\nexhaustive study by various observers. It was discovered that many of\r\nthe mental disturbances of the aged could be attributed directly to\r\narteriosclerosis alone. Korsakow's syndrome has been found to be as\r\nfrequently due to senility as it is to alcoholism. Some of our more\r\nmodern works on psychiatry have included very elaborate chapters on\r\npurely \"presenile\" conditions. Kraepelin[158] in his last edition devotes\r\ntwenty pages to a review of this subject.\r\n\r\nHe divides the presenile psychoses into melancholia, anxieties, late\r\nkatatonia, depressive delusional conditions, anxious delusional\r\ntypes terminating in advanced deterioration, depressive states with\r\ndeterioration, excitements and paranoid forms. The development of\r\nKraepelin's conception of melancholia has been fully discussed in\r\nanother chapter. He speaks also of the occasional occurrence of anxious\r\nconditions in late life with excitements or an exalted mood with\r\ngrandiose ideas or even paranoid manifestations. These may present a\r\ncatatonic picture with more or less inaccessibility, stereotypies,\r\npeculiar attitudes and movements, absurd resistance, impulsiveness,\r\ndesultoriness and disconnected speech. Our knowledge as to the exact\r\ncausation and nature of katatonia still being far from complete, he\r\nknows of no reason why a process of that kind should not be recognized\r\nas one of the presenile conditions. Thalbitzer suggested the name,\r\ndepressive delusional insanity (depressiven Wahnsinn), for the\r\nconditions exhibiting numerous delusions and active hallucinations\r\nwith an emotional reaction \"determined by the course of the disease.\"\r\nRehm also described a similar form associated with arteriosclerotic\r\nchanges and characterized by hallucinations of hearing, together with\r\nmannerisms and sterotypies.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[159] describes first a group of presenile cases showing the\r\ndevelopment of depressive ideas and anxious states with a progressive\r\nmental enfeeblement. Delusions of self-accusation and persecution\r\npresent themselves early in the course of the disease. Symptoms of a\r\nmore decidedly hypochondriacal type may occur later. Hallucinations and\r\nsomatic delusions also develop, often with nihilistic trends. Everyone\r\nis dead, the patient is the only one left in the world, has no legs,\r\ncannot go out of the house, has entirely disappeared, does not exist\r\nany more, etc. The consciousness is usually fairly clear, orientation\r\nis well preserved and there is no marked disturbance of thought.\r\nAnxious excitement is often an important feature. The termination\r\nis in mental enfeeblement invariably. This condition manifests\r\nitself usually at about the fortieth year. He is of the opinion that\r\nthis symptom complex cannot be considered either as belonging to\r\nmanic-depressive insanity or attributable to arteriosclerosis, nor is\r\nit catatonic in its origin.\r\n\r\nHe finds another group of cases occurring in women between forty-five\r\nand fifty years of age, characterized pathologically by striking\r\nanatomical changes and clinically by a very unfavorable course. A\r\ndepression first appears, followed by anxiety with thoughts of suicide.\r\nHallucinations do not occur as a rule. Restless and agitated excitement\r\nis a prominent symptom leading finally to confusion, clouding of\r\nconsciousness, and disorientation. This is followed by a condition of\r\nmental enfeeblement terminating in early death. Well-defined postmortem\r\nchanges have been found, such as the \"grave alteration\" described by\r\nNissl, proliferation of the glia, swelling of the protoplasmic bodies\r\nwith cell enclosures, etc., but no fibril formation. Large quantities\r\nof lipoid material are found in the surrounding vessels and in the\r\nvascular sheaths. This condition, also observed by Nitsche and Döblin,\r\nKraepelin looks upon as probably a presenile process of autotoxic\r\norigin, there being no other cause demonstrable. He does not consider\r\nthis disease process as being related to \"late katatonia,\" genuine\r\nkatatonia or manic-depressive insanity.\r\n\r\nHe would also separate out another smaller group as probably belonging\r\nto the presenile forms—cases with excitements of long duration,\r\nterminating in a marked deterioration. This condition is likely to\r\nbe of sudden onset, with depressive ideas of self-accusation, later\r\nshowing an active restlessness. These patients soon become clouded\r\nand confused, often with grandiose ideas suggesting general paresis.\r\nThey may show memory falsifications. Stuporous states occasionally\r\nintervene, followed by an active excitement. Echolalia is common.\r\n\r\nThe excitement may last for months or even for a year or more and\r\noften stops suddenly, always with deterioration later. In the\r\ncases which have come to autopsy Alzheimer has reported severe and\r\nwidespread cell alterations, fibre loss, glia reactions, and changes\r\nin the vessel walls, somewhat suggesting the pathological findings\r\nin general paresis. The cases in this group usually have been of the\r\nmale sex between sixty and seventy years of age. Kraepelin speaks of\r\nthe clinical picture as a mixture of the symptoms of general paresis,\r\nkatatonia and manic-depressive psychoses and it is usually diagnosed as\r\none or the other of these conditions.\r\n\r\nThe paranoid presenile forms occur usually in women. Consciousness is\r\nclear, although there may be a mild anxiety or hypochondriasis. The\r\npersecutory ideas are variable and changeable. Delusions of jealousy\r\nare common although hallucinations are infrequent. Memory is often\r\nsomewhat impaired and retrospective falsifications are occasionally\r\nobserved. The mood is as a rule anxious and suspicious. Suicidal\r\ntendencies often appear. Restlessness, excitement, impulsive actions\r\nand outbursts of anger are noted at times. Rarely a more cheerful mood\r\ndevelops. The disease may become stationary and show no marked changes\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nKraepelin himself seems to be very uncertain as to the significance and\r\nthe delimitation of these various presenile forms. It must be confessed\r\nthat some of the types described very strongly suggest the condition\r\nformerly looked upon by him as involutional melancholia. It will be\r\nnoted that he considers as possible etiological factors the disturbance\r\nof metabolism which may result from regressive or involutional\r\nprocesses. The differentiation from manic-depressive forms, from\r\narteriosclerotic disorders and from senile psychoses must also be\r\nlooked upon as presenting some difficulties which cannot be entirely\r\ndisregarded. Many possibilities suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the senile deteriorations Kraepelin notes particularly a loss in\r\nthe capacity of apprehension and perception, with a sluggishness of\r\nthe train of thought, a dulling of the emotions, a reduction of energy\r\nand the development of conduct disorders. Ranschburg in psychological\r\ntests noticed a lengthening of the reaction time, with a delay in the\r\nchoice of action, the reading of words, the performance of addition,\r\nand the formation of judgment. The retardation was shown particularly\r\nin psychic processes and the association time. The reactions were,\r\nmoreover, much more monotonous, irregular and unreliable than in the\r\nyoung. Memory tests also showed poor associations.\r\n\r\nThe most advanced form Kraepelin describes as senile dementia, a\r\nprogressive mental enfeeblement in which the loss of apprehension\r\nand memory becomes a conspicuous feature. The perception of external\r\nimpressions is diminished and delayed and there is a profound disorder\r\nof attention. Memory of the remote past is much better than it is for\r\ncurrent events. Retrospective falsification is a common symptom. The\r\npatient is, moreover, unable to change old viewpoints or acquire new\r\nones. Delusional manifestations such as childish egotism, foolish\r\nsuspicions or notions of impending illness develop. Grandiose ideas\r\noften occur, delusions of great wealth being common. These symptoms\r\nare transitory and come and go without apparent reason. In some cases\r\nthe hallucinations resemble those found in the alcoholic psychoses.\r\nSooner or later there is a disturbance of consciousness leading to\r\na dreamlike existence suggesting a delirium. There is a noticeable\r\ndulling of the emotional feelings. The patients become indifferent\r\nand apathetic, losing interest in their surroundings, and are often\r\nirritable and excitable. In a certain number of cases depressive\r\nstates develop, sometimes with suicidal tendencies. The delusions\r\nmay be hypochondriacal or nihilistic in character. Complaints of\r\npersecution are common. Some of the patients show a simple, childish\r\ndeterioration with seclusive tendencies. Stuporous or cataleptic states\r\nmay develop. Others become uneasy, wander in the streets, remove their\r\nclothes, collect rubbish, or show sexual excitement. Restlessness at\r\nnight is especially suggestive.\r\n\r\nDelirious excited states (\"Senile Delirium\") characterized a certain\r\nnumber of Kraepelin's cases. In these, clouding of consciousness is\r\nmarked. The presbyophrenic complex described by Kahlbaum often occurs.\r\nThese cases are fairly clear mentally at first, as far as their\r\nsurroundings are concerned, but show memory disturbances, particularly\r\nfor recent events. Orientation is lost very soon and they fail to\r\nrecognize old friends and relatives. Fabrications are resorted to for\r\nthe purpose of remedying these defects of memory and delusions are very\r\ncommon. Nevertheless, judgment about many things is well retained. In\r\nsome instances, however, orientation for time, place and person is\r\ncompletely lost. Kraepelin is in doubt as to whether presbyophrenia\r\nshould be looked upon as constituting a definite entity or only a form\r\nof senile insanity. It may last for years or terminate in a marked\r\ndeterioration. In some of the senile cases arteriosclerotic changes\r\nin the cortex are very pronounced. This is more noticeable in the\r\ndepressive and anxious forms and in the incoherent varieties. These\r\nindividuals become clouded, incoherent, and deteriorate rapidly.\r\n\r\nThere is also a characteristic paranoid form of senile psychosis.\r\nDelusions of suspicion and jealousy are common in these cases. They\r\nusually develop persecutory trends and often exhibit hallucinations\r\nof hearing. They sometimes show partial disorientation and gaps in\r\nthe memory. The mood is usually irritable and often anxious. There is\r\nvery likely to be a disturbance of sleep and often signs of physical\r\nenfeeblement. There may be neurological symptoms caused by the\r\narteriosclerotic complications, such as headache, pupillary changes,\r\ntremors of the tongue and disturbance of the reflexes. Tremors are\r\nalso shown in the writing. Paraphasia occurs and there may be sensory\r\naphasia or apraxia.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases of senile dementia Kraepelin expects to find definite\r\nlesions at autopsy. The brain weight is always decreased, sometimes\r\nto a very striking degree. The volume of the brain is reduced and the\r\nventricles enlarged. The cortex is diminished in thickness, the frontal\r\nregion being most affected. The parietal region may be involved, but\r\nnot to any such extent as in general paresis. There may be localized\r\nareas of atrophy. Pachymeningitis and hemorrhagic membranes are often\r\nfound. The microscope shows a proliferation of the glia cells and\r\nthere is often some disturbance of the layering of the cortex. Cell\r\nalterations appear, with fatty degeneration, some neurones showing\r\nlittle more than a darkly colored nucleus. The glia cells are enlarged.\r\nThere should be no marked changes in the vessels. Fatty changes in the\r\nganglion cells are very noticeable. There is also some loss in the\r\ntangential fibres.\r\n\r\nQuite characteristic of the senile brain is the occurrence of\r\nthe miliary plaques or \"drusen\" described by Redlich in 1898.\r\nFischer in 1907 reached the conclusion that these \"drusen\" were\r\npathognomonic of presbyophrenia, as he did not find them in senile\r\ndementia, in other psychoses or in normal brains. Hübner, however,\r\nnoted them in alcoholics and \"circular\" cases as well as in normal\r\nindividuals. Oppenheim also found them in the brains of the aged\r\nwhen no psychoses were observed. The interior of the plaque is a\r\nhomogeneous, dark-staining, structureless mass. Sometimes there is a\r\nclear space around this center, with club- or spindle-shaped bodies\r\nin the periphery, representing remnants probably of neurones, glia\r\ncells or axis cylinders. The whole structure is encapsulated in glia\r\nfibres. These so-called plaques were spoken of by Fischer as \"miliare\r\nNekrosen\" and by Redlich as \"miliare Sclerosen.\" Kraepelin is of the\r\nopinion that they are associated either with senile cases showing\r\narteriosclerotic changes or presbyophrenia. Alzheimer has described a\r\nsenile atrophy of the brain with wedgeshaped areas showing cell loss.\r\nThis is due to a gradual occlusion of the smaller vessels extending\r\ndown from the meninges into the cortex, and may result in a hemorrhage,\r\na softening or merely an atrophic area characterized by an absence of\r\nganglion cells. He has also described another group of cases showing\r\ncharacteristic cell changes.\r\n\r\nThis condition has been given the name \"Alzheimer's disease\" by\r\nKraepelin.[160] It is marked clinically by a gradual senile deterioration\r\nwith organic brain changes. These eases show some thought defect,\r\nloss of memory, confusion, and clouding. Later they become restless,\r\ntalkative, sing and laugh, etc. Aphasic disturbances develop early,\r\nwith paraphasia or apraxia. There are speech disturbances ending\r\nin a senseless jargon and writing becomes impossible. An advanced\r\ndeterioration ensues. Physically there is a general weakness and\r\nuncertain gait, sometimes with epileptiform attacks. The pupillary\r\nreaction may be lost and evidences of arteriosclerosis usually appear.\r\nThe disease may last for many years. At autopsy \"drusen\" are common\r\nin the cortex and almost a third of the nerve cells are found to be\r\ndestroyed. These are replaced by darkly-staining fibril bundles. There\r\nis marked neuroglia reaction, particularly around the \"drusen\" and\r\nretrogressive changes are found in the vessel walls. This disease\r\nusually appears about the fortieth year and may be looked upon,\r\nKraepelin says, as a \"senium praecox,\" although its significance is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nHe finds the senile psychoses occurring usually between the ages of\r\nsixty-five and eighty, although they occasionally appear before sixty.\r\nSeven and sixty-seven hundredths per cent of his cases were between\r\nsixty and sixty-five years of age; ten per cent between sixty-five\r\nand seventy; thirty-five per cent between seventy and seventy-five;\r\n27.8 per cent between seventy-five and eighty; 22.2 per cent between\r\neighty and eighty-five; 10.5 per cent between eighty-five and ninety;\r\nand 2.78 per cent were over ninety years of age. Of 183 cases studied,\r\ntwenty-three per cent were cases of presbyophrenia; sixty-three per\r\ncent of simple deterioration; eight per cent of arteriosclerotic\r\norigin; and the remainder, of delusional forms. More than half of the\r\ncases of presbyophrenia occurred in persons over seventy-five. The\r\nparanoid and arteriosclerotic forms occurred in younger individuals. In\r\nthe alcoholic cases the Korsakow complex was common. The analysis of\r\npresenile psychoses made by Kraepelin is, to say the least, exceedingly\r\ninteresting. Such clear-cut differentiations as he describes are,\r\nhowever, not always possible or necessary. Very few other writers have\r\ngone into the question so exhaustively, nor is his classification of\r\nthese conditions generally accepted. Bleuler[161] in 1918 in discussing\r\nthe presenile psychoses quotes Kraepelin's classification and\r\nalso refers to Gaupp's anxious depressive forms. Under the senile\r\ndeteriorations he describes \"dementia senilis\" and presbyophrenia. He\r\nalso calls attention to the fact that Binswanger spoke of a \"pre-senile\r\ndementia\" occurring between the fortieth and fiftieth years of age and\r\ncharacterized by an emotional dulness and a diminished capacity for\r\nwork. Bleuler speaks of the affective disturbances in advanced years\r\nas senile mania and melancholia, which he says may recover, the former\r\nfrequently, the latter more rarely.\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association has only attempted to cover\r\nthe principal groupings of the characteristic senile forms. The\r\ndifferentiation of these conditions as suggested in the statistical\r\nmanual is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"A well defined type of psychosis which as a rule develops gradually\r\nand is characterized by the following symptoms: Impairment of retention\r\n(forgetfulness) and general failure of memory more marked for recent\r\nexperiences; defects in orientation and a general reduction of\r\nmental capacity; the attention, concentration and thinking processes\r\nare interfered with; there is self-centering of interests, often\r\nirritability and stubborn opposition; a tendency to reminiscences and\r\nfabrications. Accompanying this deterioration there may occur paranoid\r\ntrends, depressions, confused states, etc. Certain clinical types\r\nshould therefore be specified, but these often overlap:\r\n\r\n\"(a) Simple deterioration: Retention and memory defects, reduction\r\nin intellectual capacity and narrowing of interests; usually also\r\nsuspiciousness, irritability and restlessness, the latter particularly\r\nat night.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Presbyophrenic type: Severe memory and retention defects with\r\ncomplete disorientation; but at the same time preservation of\r\nmental alertness and attentiveness with ability to grasp immediate\r\nimpressions and conversation quite well. Forgetfulness leads to absurd\r\ncontradictions and repetitions; suggestibility and free fabrication are\r\nprominent symptoms. (The general picture resembles the Korsakow mental\r\ncomplex.)\r\n\r\n\"(c) Delirious and confused types: Often in the early stages of the\r\npsychoses and for a long period the picture is one of deep confusion\r\nor of a delirious condition.\r\n\r\n\"(d) Depressed and agitated types: In addition to the underlying\r\ndeterioration there may be a pronounced depression and persistent\r\nagitation.\r\n\r\n\"(e) Paranoid types: Well marked delusional trends, chiefly persecutory\r\nor expansive ideas, often accompany the deterioration and in the early\r\nstages may make the diagnosis difficult if the defect symptoms are mild.\r\n\r\n\"(f) Pre-senile types: The so-called 'Alzheimer's disease.' An early\r\nsenile deterioration which usually leads rapidly to a deep dementia.\r\nReported to occur as early as the fortieth year. Most cases show an\r\nirritable or anxious depressive mood with aphasic or apractic symptoms.\r\nThere is apt to be general resistiveness and sometimes spasticity.\r\n\r\n\"(g) Other types.\"\r\n\r\nThe frequency of senile cases is shown by the fact that of 84,143\r\nadmissions to the New York hospitals during a period of sixteen years,\r\n12,017, or 14.2 per cent, were over sixty years of age, while 8.4\r\nper cent were between sixty and seventy years old, and 4.5 per cent\r\nbetween seventy and eighty. Of 49,640 first admissions to the New York\r\nstate hospitals during eight years 4,724 cases, or 9.52 per cent,\r\nwere diagnosed as senile psychoses. They constituted 9.63 per cent of\r\nthe admissions in Massachusetts during 1919 and 10.61 per cent of the\r\n18,336 admissions to twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other states. Of\r\n70,987 admissions to all of the institutions referred to, 6,961, or 9.8\r\nper cent, were senile psychoses.\r\n\r\nDuring a period of eight years in the New York state hospitals, when\r\nthe present classification was not adhered to absolutely, 4,724 senile\r\npsychoses were divided into types as follows:—Simple deterioration,\r\n52.01 per cent; presbyophrenia, 5.75 per cent; delirious and confused\r\nstates, 12.99 per cent; depressed and agitated forms, 8.25 per cent;\r\nand paranoid varieties, 16.23 per cent. During the same period less\r\nthan one per cent of presenile psychoses were reported. Since the\r\nAssociation's classification has been in use the same institutions\r\nshow the following distribution of 1,351 senile psychoses during 1918\r\nand 1919:—Simple deterioration, 56.24 per cent; presbyophrenia, 4.14\r\nper cent; delirious and confused states, 13.53 per cent; depressed\r\nand agitated forms, 18.65 per cent; and paranoid varieties and\r\npresenile forms, less than one per cent. The senile psychoses in the\r\nMassachusetts hospitals during 1919 were divided as follows:—Simple\r\ndeterioration, 56.94 per cent; presbyophrenia, 7.79 per cent; delirious\r\nand confused states, 7.45 per cent; depressed and agitated forms, 7.11\r\nper cent; paranoid conditions, 18.64 per cent; and presenile forms,\r\n2.03 per cent. In nineteen hospitals in other states 1,823 cases\r\nwere classified as follows:—Simple deterioration, 64.39 per cent;\r\npresbyophrenia, 11.62 per cent; delirious and confused states, 9.59 per\r\ncent; depressed and agitated forms, 4.71 per cent; paranoid conditions,\r\n6.91 per cent; and presenile forms, .27 per cent. The total of 6,842\r\ncases referred to above were, therefore, distributed as to type as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    _Type_                          _Per Cent_\r\n\r\n  Simple deterioration                 55.52\r\n  Presbyophrenia                        7.40\r\n  Delirious and confused states        11.83\r\n  Depressed and agitated forms          7.26\r\n  Paranoid conditions                  13.85\r\n\r\nFour hundred and nineteen cases reported by the Ohio state hospitals in\r\n1920 and not included in the above summary were shown as follows:—\r\n\r\n    _Type_                          _Per Cent_\r\n\r\n  Simple deterioration                 49.88\r\n  Presbyophrenic types                  6.20\r\n  Delirious and confused forms         18.61\r\n  Depressed and agitated conditions     7.39\r\n  Paranoid states                      15.75\r\n  Presenile types                       2.14\r\n\r\nThese constituted in all 14.4 per cent of the 2,895 first admissions\r\nduring the year, a much higher rate than that shown in other states. In\r\nanalyzing these findings it should be borne in mind that the American\r\nclassifications do not take into consideration presenile conditions\r\nas such, they being all reported with the senile psychoses, with the\r\nexception of involutional melancholia, which is, of course, shown\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSouthard[162] has called attention to the margin of error in the\r\ndiagnosis of senile psychoses. Forty-two cases unanimously diagnosed\r\nas \"senile dementia\" were \"reviewed clinically and anatomically, with\r\na surprisingly low general percentage of accuracy (sixty-six per cent)\r\nwhere either cerebral atrophy or cortical arteriosclerosis or both were\r\nregarded as confirmatory, and with still lower percentages: (48 per\r\ncent) where cortical arteriosclerosis was considered essential and (38\r\nper cent) where cerebral atrophy was considered essential for a correct\r\ndiagnosis.\" It is significant that exactly one-third of the cases\r\nstudied were found by Southard to more properly \"belong in a group of\r\nacute psychoses or other mental diseases occurring in old age but not\r\ndependent on recognizable senile changes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH CEREBRAL ARTERIOSCLEROSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nSufficient weight has not been attached heretofore to the important\r\ninfluence of cerebral arteriosclerosis in the production of mental\r\ndiseases. Unquestionably it has been a complicating factor in many of\r\nthe generally recognized psychoses which has not been given adequate\r\nconsideration. Its relation to involution melancholia as well as\r\nthe presenile and senile disorders has been given a great deal of\r\nattention, but cannot as yet be clearly defined. Only in its syphilitic\r\nforms can it be looked upon as contributing to the clinical picture in\r\ngeneral paresis. It is, however, productive of late deterioration in\r\nthe chronic alcoholic conditions and in the manic-depressive psychoses\r\noccurring in advanced years. It plays a part frequently in the terminal\r\nstages of dementia praecox. In paranoia and the paranoid conditions of\r\nlong standing it often becomes a factor to be reckoned with. Certainly\r\nin the differentiation of the epilepsies of the aged it must be taken\r\ninto definite account.\r\n\r\nThe importance of arteriosclerosis, a term used first by Lobstein some\r\nseventy-five years ago, has long been recognized. Osler in referring to\r\nthis subject made the following interesting comment:—\"To a majority of\r\nmen death comes primarily or secondarily through this portal. The onset\r\nof what may be called physiological arteriosclerosis depends, in the\r\nfirst place, upon the quality of arterial tissue (vital rubber) which\r\nthe individual has inherited and secondarily upon the amount of wear\r\nand tear to which he has subjected it. That the former plays the most\r\nimportant rôle is shown in the cases in which arteriosclerosis sets in\r\nearly in life in individuals in whom none of the recognized etiological\r\nfactors can be found. Entire families sometimes show this tendency to\r\nearly arteriosclerosis, a tendency which cannot be explained in any\r\nother way than that in the make-up of the machine bad material was used\r\nfor the tubing.\"\r\n\r\nOur present knowledge as to the relation of syphilis to this disease\r\nhas not changed the significance of the observations made by Osler in\r\nany way. Heredity more than any other one factor undoubtedly determines\r\nthe development of both senility and arteriosclerosis. \"When,\" as\r\nLambert[163] expresses it, \"physiological involution anticipates in time\r\nor exceeds in direction, extent and severity normal senescence, the\r\nvarious senile and arteriosclerotic disorders are the result.\" It is\r\nas a rule only in the later stages of the disease when focal symptoms\r\noccur or a psychosis develops that hospital care becomes necessary.\r\nPractically any of the vessels of the brain may be involved and it\r\nfrequently happens that more than one is affected either directly or\r\nindirectly. The neurological symptoms resulting depend entirely on the\r\nlocation and extent of the lesion. Lambert[164] has made the following\r\nexcellent anatomical classification of the more common arteriosclerotic\r\nprocesses:—\r\n\r\n  I.   Incipient type.\r\n  II.  Focal types.\r\n        (a) Trunk disorders.\r\n           1. Basilar-carotids.\r\n        (b) Branch disorders.\r\n           1. Inferior cerebellar.\r\n           2. Superior cerebellar.\r\n           3. Posterior cerebral.\r\n           4. Middle cerebral.\r\n           5. Anterior cerebral.\r\n        (c) Twig disorders.\r\n           1. Medullary.\r\n           2. Cortical.\r\n\r\nSome reference should be made, perhaps, to the focal symptoms resulting\r\nfrom more or less sharply circumscribed lesions which are productive of\r\ncertain fairly well known complexes, whether due to arteriosclerotic\r\nsoftenings, hemorrhages, or growths. These have been concisely\r\nsummarized by Barker[165] somewhat as follows:—\r\n\r\nFrontal Lobes—Lesions of the left inferior frontal in righthanded\r\npersons cause motor aphasia. Subcortical involvements cause word\r\ndumbness. Disturbances in the anterior part of the frontal region are\r\nsometimes associated with the Witzelsucht of the German writers—a\r\ntendency towards joking and witticisms.\r\n\r\nCentral and Paracentral Lobules—Contralateral sensory, motor symptoms\r\nor a combination of the two. Monoplegias, anesthesias and Jacksonian\r\nepilepsies are characteristic. Contralateral tactile agnosia and\r\napraxia occur, especially in lesions of the left hemisphere. An\r\ninvolvement of the left side may also cause a homolateral apraxia,\r\ndyspraxia or a tactile agnosia.\r\n\r\nParietal Lobes—Lesions in the anterior part cause contralateral\r\nsomesthetic disturbances, tactile agnosia or apraxia. Involvement of\r\nthe left angular gyrus may cause optic aphasia or alexia; if deep\r\nenough, hemianopsia results. The voluntary movement of the eye may be\r\ninterfered with.\r\n\r\nTemporal Lobe—Lesions in the posterior half of the first temporal may\r\ncause Wernicke's sensory aphasia and a subcortical involvement, word\r\ndeafness. Bilateral destruction of the first and transverse temporals\r\ncauses cortical deafness. Extensive bilateral lesions in the lower\r\npart of these lobes result in mind deafness. Irritative lesions in the\r\nuncinate gyrus lead to hallucinations of taste and smell, with smacking\r\nof the lips and tongue movements.\r\n\r\nIsland of Reil—Lesions of the anterior part cause symptoms resembling\r\nBroca's motor aphasia. Lesions of the posterior part result in symptoms\r\nsuggesting Wernicke's sensory aphasia. Transcortical motor and sensory\r\naphasia may result.\r\n\r\nOccipital Lobes—Lesions of the calcarine area give rise to\r\nhemianopsia, and bicortical involvements lead to cortical blindness.\r\nBilateral lesions of the lateral surface may cause mind blindness.\r\n\r\nDisturbances in the centrum ovale may cause monoplegias or\r\nmonoanesthesias, and lesions in the corpus callosum, apraxic symptoms.\r\nCharacteristic of cerebellar lesions are ataxias and disturbances of\r\nequilibrium, often with vertigo and paroxysmal vomiting.\r\n\r\nAn involvement of the corpora quadrigemina may cause pupillary changes,\r\nunilateral or bilateral paralysis of eye muscles, nystagmus, visual\r\ndisturbances, deafness and ataxia or anesthesia.\r\n\r\nLesions of the cerebral peduncles may give rise to very characteristic\r\nsyndromes. If the tegmentum and pes pedunculi (basis pedunculi) are\r\nboth involved, there may be a complete hemiplegia of the opposite side\r\nwith an oculomotor paralysis on the same side (Weber-Gubler syndrome).\r\nOr there may be in addition to this a marked tremor in the limbs of the\r\nparalyzed side (Benedikt's syndrome). A unilateral oculomotor paralysis\r\nmay be combined with a cerebellar ataxia (Nothnagel's syndrome).\r\nThe thalmic syndrome of Déjerine and Roussy shows a contralateral\r\nhemianesthesia, violent and persistent pains on the anesthetic side,\r\nhemiataxia, hemichorea or hemiathetosis, slight temporary hemiparesis\r\nand sometimes hyperesthesia. Lesions further back, possibly involving\r\nthe internal capsule, may cause hemianesthesia of touch, pain and\r\ntemperature senses.\r\n\r\nS. A. K. Wilson in 1912 called attention to a particularly important\r\nsyndrome, designated by him as \"progressive lenticular degeneration\"\r\nand characterized by dysarthria, dysphagia, general tremors of the\r\nextremities, forced laughing and crying, muscular rigidities and\r\ncontractures, with a slight intellectual impairment. Interesting\r\nfeatures of this disease complex are that it is familial in type, but\r\nnot hereditary, comes on early in life, usually progressing to a fatal\r\ntermination, and is associated with a cirrhosis of the liver which\r\nis not alcoholic in origin. At autopsy degenerations of the nucleus\r\nlentiformis have been found. J. Ramsey Hunt in 1916 called attention to\r\nthe association of both paralysis agitans and Huntington's chorea with\r\nlesions in the globus pallidus. Oppenheim has recently differentiated\r\na striatum syndrome to which he gave the name \"dystonia musculorum.\"\r\nDifficulties in writing, tremors, disturbance of the gait, rigidities,\r\ntonic and clonic movements of the muscles and other neurological\r\nsymptoms are present. Several cases reported by Abrahamson in 1920\r\nshowed definite emotional disturbances. Cecile and Oskar Vogt have\r\nrecently (1919) studied the striatum lesions from a standpoint of both\r\npathology and symptomatology. As summarized by Lhermitte[166] their work\r\nshows that athetosis, paralysis agitans, Huntington's chorea, dystonia\r\nmusculorum, probably paralysis agitans and various other neurological\r\nsyndromes are to be attributed directly to conditions involving the\r\nstriate bodies. Prominent among these are softenings and hemorrhages\r\nwhich may result from arteriosclerosis. In view of these facts a\r\ncareful study of the focal lesions associated with the arteriosclerotic\r\ndisorders is exceedingly important.\r\n\r\nThe pathological processes involved have been carefully studied by\r\nHeubner and others. He was originally of the opinion that cerebral\r\narteriosclerosis was always of specific origin. Baumgarten, however,\r\nsubsequently showed that this was not the case. The more characteristic\r\nchanges in the larger vessels manifest themselves in the form of\r\npatches of atheromatous thickening so common at autopsy. As a result\r\nof degenerative changes in the elastica and media, and a consequent\r\nweakening of the vessel wall, intimal thickening takes place. This is\r\nnot the circular, uniform, concentric involvement found in syphilitic\r\nprocesses but a localized proliferation of the intima at some one\r\npoint. There may be an infiltration of colloid and calcareous material\r\nin the media. This leads to further intimal thickening. In the smaller\r\nvessels arteriocapillary fibrosis has been described—a uniform\r\nthickening of the vessel walls with a connective tissue formation.\r\nEndarteritis obliterans, first described by Friedländer in 1876, is\r\nprobably always of syphilitic origin.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the vascular changes in the cerebral vessels\r\nKraepelin[167] finds usually atheromatous changes in the aorta and its\r\nbranches, particularly the coronaries, with ulcerations or calcareous\r\nplates, hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart, myocarditis,\r\ninterstitial nephritis and infarctions of various organs. At autopsy\r\nthe dura and pia are usually thickened and adherent, with a general\r\natrophy of the cerebral convolutions. There are often fresh\r\nhemorrhages under the membranes as well as cyst formations and\r\ndilatation of the brain ventricles. He particularly emphasizes a\r\nsplitting of the elastica in the larger cerebral vessels with a\r\nthickening and tortuosity, fatty infiltration and calcareous deposits.\r\nHyaline degeneration is common in the elastica and muscularis with\r\nfatty granular cells in the adventitia. Capillary aneurysms are often\r\nfound. Glia proliferation is to be expected in the surrounding area. A\r\ncondition described by Alzheimer as perivascular gliosis often occurs.\r\nThere is a disappearance of the perivascular nervous elements with\r\nconsequent proliferation of the neuroglia. In a general way Kraepelin\r\ndifferentiates several distinct pathological groups—a diffuse cortical\r\ninvolvement, circumscribed processes in the neighborhood of vessels,\r\nhemorrhages and softenings. There is also a loss of nerve fibres\r\nwhich are replaced by neuroglia. Binswanger has described a \"chronic\r\nsubcortical encephalitis\" due to arteriosclerosis. This consists of an\r\natrophy of the white matter due to an involvement of the deeper marrow\r\nvessels. Large gaps and lacunae are found in the course of the vessels.\r\nThere is an extensive atrophy of the fibres and there may be occasional\r\nfoci of softening. As a general rule involvement of the large vessels\r\nis liable to affect the medullary substance while sclerosis of the\r\nsmaller vessels leads to cortical disturbances. It is also possible\r\nto have extensive lesions without mental symptoms and well developed\r\npsychoses with only a slight physical basis. The site of the damage to\r\nthe vessels determines this. On the other hand, the mental condition\r\nmay be due to cardiovascular complications resulting usually in\r\nanxiety psychoses. The symptomatology may be complicated by senility,\r\nalcoholism or syphilis.\r\n\r\nClinically Kraepelin[168] divides the arteriosclerotic psychoses into\r\ndeteriorations, or milder forms of mental enfeeblement, dementias,\r\ndepressions, excitements, late epilepsies, and apoplectic dementia.\r\nIn the milder forms there is a gradual change in the entire psychic\r\npersonality, with a later development of more marked changes, either\r\nphysical, mental or both. The early symptoms are a general reduction\r\nof the mental capacity and an impairment of memory. The patient tires\r\neasily and loses all evidences of energy, with no inclination to\r\nundertake anything new. Familiar names and dates are forgotten. Recent\r\noccurrences are particularly lost to memory. The real is confused with\r\nthe false. In business the patient becomes careless and unreliable,\r\noverlooks important transactions and forgets appointments. There are\r\noften subjective feelings of impending illness. The mood becomes\r\ndepressed, whining and tearful. Irritability and outbursts of anger\r\noccasionally appear, characterized by a marked emotional instability,\r\nvarying rapidly from tears to laughter. Suicidal tendencies are\r\nsometimes noted. Mild confusional states may be induced by alcoholic\r\nindulgences. Early physical symptoms are headache, sensations of\r\nfulness and pressure in the head, followed by a feeling of dizziness,\r\nfatigue, exhaustion, debility, etc. Sooner or later, following a\r\nseizure of some kind, neurological signs appear—drooping of the\r\nmouth, lateral deviation of the tongue, weakness of an arm, dragging\r\nof one leg, loss of sensation on one side, ankle clonus, an increase,\r\ndecrease or inequality of the patellar reflexes, and sometimes a\r\nBabinski reflex. The pupils are very likely to be unequal and sluggish\r\nin reaction. The features present a tired, sleepy expression and\r\nspeech becomes tremulous and monotonous. There may be a difficulty\r\nin finding words, or the misuse of words. There are usually tremors\r\nof the fingers and movements are uncertain, the gait being unsteady.\r\nRomberg's symptom may be present. Dizzy spells and fainting attacks\r\nalso occur, sometimes followed by genuine convulsions. Apoplectiform\r\nseizures may be observed, with unconsciousness for hours or days. These\r\nmay be followed by sensory or motor aphasia, unilateral paralysis with\r\nor without disturbances of sensation, hemianopsia, alexia, agraphia,\r\nasymbolism or apraxia. Cardiac disturbances with anxieties are often\r\ncomplications. These apoplectiform and other severe attacks sometimes\r\noccur a long time after mental symptoms have appeared. They are likely\r\nto recur, mental deterioration progressing rapidly with the repetition\r\nof the seizures.\r\n\r\nApprehension is much disturbed and memory weakened, in the advanced\r\ncases of deterioration. The patients cannot remember anything for\r\nmore than a short time. They become disoriented as to time, place and\r\nperson and forget their own names. Genuine \"confabulation\" sometimes\r\nappears. There are often confusional and delirious states. The mood is\r\nfrequently depressed or anxious, sometimes irritable or quarrelsome\r\nand at times humorous. There is a group of cases showing genuine\r\ndepressions, usually with hypochondriacal delusions, sometimes with\r\ndelusions of persecution, self-accusation, and ideas of sinfulness.\r\nEven delusions of grandeur are observed. Hallucinations are not\r\ninfrequent in these cases. States of excitement may intervene with\r\noccasional delusions and confused attacks. These excitements are\r\nusually of the agitated, restless type, sometimes with suicidal\r\ninclinations. Stuporous or even cataleptic states may follow. In the\r\nhighest forms of excitement sensory or motor aphasia may develop,\r\noften with speech disturbances, sometimes of a genuine scanning\r\ntype. Paraphasias are common. The writing is ataxic or paragraphic.\r\nIdeational or motor apraxia often is a symptom. Cyanoses and other\r\nevidences of general arteriosclerotic involvement appear. There may be\r\nan albuminuric retinitis. Albumen and sometimes sugar appear in the\r\nurine. The radials and temporals are thickened or hardened and cardiac\r\nmurmurs are often found. Blood pressure is greatly increased in many\r\ninstances, although Romberg found it in only ten per cent of his cases.\r\nSleep is usually interfered with to a marked degree.\r\n\r\nIn a certain number of the more advanced cases of arteriosclerosis late\r\nepilepsies appear. The attacks usually begin between the forty-fifth\r\nand sixty-fifth years. There may be fainting spells or genuine\r\nconvulsions recurring at frequent intervals. These may be associated\r\nwith brief periods of delirium or may even occur without loss of\r\nconsciousness. Forgetfulness and mental enfeeblement soon appear in\r\nsuch cases. They also show physical changes with tremors, disturbed\r\nreflexes, paralyses, increased blood pressure, etc. Alcoholism seems\r\nto be a strongly predisposing factor in this form of arteriosclerotic\r\ndisorder. Kraepelin found that the epileptic attacks almost invariably\r\nappeared in cases which showed a previous history of alcoholic excesses.\r\n\r\nIn nearly half of his cases Kraepelin found apoplectiform attacks\r\nappearing without any marked psychosis preceding them. In some\r\ninstances no mental symptoms appeared for many years. The attacks\r\nwere, however, immediately followed, usually, by periods of confusion\r\nand clouding, sometimes of excitement and violence. The acute\r\ndisturbance as a rule subsides rather quickly and clears up partially\r\nor completely. Usually there remains a memory defect, an increased\r\nfatigability and a depressed or irritable mood. These he refers to as\r\ncases of apoplectic deterioration or mental enfeeblement. Recurrent\r\napoplectiform seizures may result in excitement, depressions or\r\ndeliria. Gradual progressive deterioration is the usual picture. As a\r\ngeneral rule the cases with marked excitements, depressions and deliria\r\nare of short duration and have a bad prognosis.\r\n\r\nKraepelin finds that the arteriosclerotic psychoses appear a decade\r\nearlier than the senile psychoses. Less than one per cent developed at\r\nthe age of forty; 2.7 per cent at forty-five; 3.7 per cent at fifty;\r\n7.4 per cent at fifty-five; twenty-two per cent at sixty; twenty-two\r\nper cent at sixty-five; 18.57 per cent at seventy; twelve per cent at\r\nseventy-five, etc. In the cases observed at a particularly early age\r\nhe believes heredity to be a very important factor. Seventy-one and\r\nfive-tenths per cent of his cases were men. Sixty-two per cent of the\r\nmen and fifty-three per cent of the women were less than sixty-five\r\nyears of age. The epileptic and demented forms appear earlier than the\r\napoplectiform variety. Arteriosclerotic involvement of the smaller\r\nvessels occurs earlier than that of the larger arteries. Kraepelin\r\nfound alcoholism more common in the history of his cases than syphilis.\r\nHe is uncertain whether specific infections can produce a genuine\r\narteriosclerosis or not.\r\n\r\nErb has shown that by the experimental injection of adrenalin into\r\nthe blood stream artificial arteriosclerosis can be produced, with\r\nan increase of blood pressure, splitting of the elastica, thickening\r\nof the vessel walls and aneurysm formation. Thoma considers alcohol,\r\ntobacco, coffee, tea, and infectious poisons important causes. Cramer\r\nfound the disease more common in innkeepers, actors, directors,\r\nofficers, bankers and parliamentarians. Alcohol, syphilis, overwork\r\nand high living are important etiological factors. Kraepelin assumes\r\nthe existence of certain metabolic products in the blood, possibly the\r\nresult of infections which affect blood pressure and the structure of\r\nthe vessel walls during a period of lowered resistance.\r\n\r\nThe pathological changes associated with the arteriosclerotic psychoses\r\nare quite clearly demarcated. Clinical differentiations, however, are\r\nnot so well established. There is some question as to the justification\r\nof the separate entities into which Kraepelin would divide the\r\narteriosclerotic processes. For statistical purposes the Association's\r\ncommittee felt that a determination of the frequency of occurrence of\r\nthe arteriosclerotic group as a whole is all that should be attempted\r\nat this time. The following suggestions were offered in the manual as\r\nto the delimitations of these conditions:—\r\n\r\n\"The clinical symptoms, both mental and physical, are varied depending\r\nin the first place on the distribution and severity of the vascular\r\ncerebral disease and probably to some extent on the mental make-up of\r\nthe person.\r\n\r\n\"Cerebral physical symptoms, headaches, dizziness, fainting attacks,\r\netc., are nearly always present, and usually signs of focal brain\r\ndisease appear sooner or later (aphasia, paralysis, etc.).\r\n\r\n\"The most important mental symptoms (particularly if the\r\narteriosclerotic disease is diffuse) are impairment of mental tension,\r\n_i.e._, interference with the capacity to think quickly and accurately,\r\nto concentrate and to fix the attention; fatigability and lack of\r\nemotional control (alternate weeping and laughing), often a tendency\r\nto irritability is marked; the retention is impaired and with it there\r\nis more or less general defect of memory, especially in the advanced\r\nstages of the disease, or after some large destructive lesion occurs.\r\n\r\n\"Pronounced psychotic symptoms may appear in the form of depression\r\n(often of the anxious type), suspicions or paranoid ideas, or episodes\r\nof marked confusion.\r\n\r\n\"To be included in this group are the psychoses following cerebral\r\nsoftening or hemorrhage, if due to arterial disease. (Autopsies in\r\nstate hospitals show that in arteriosclerotic cases softening is\r\nrelatively much more frequent than hemorrhage.)\r\n\r\n\"Differentiation from senile psychosis is sometimes difficult\r\nparticularly if the arteriosclerotic disease manifests itself in\r\nthe senile period. The two conditions may be associated; when this\r\nhappens preference should be given in the statistical report to the\r\narteriosclerotic disorder.\r\n\r\n\"High blood pressure, although usually present, is not essential for\r\nthe diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis.\"\r\n\r\nIn the 49,640 admissions to the New York state hospitals during a\r\nperiod of eight years the 2,318 cases diagnosed as psychoses with\r\narteriosclerosis constituted 4.67 per cent of the total number. In\r\ntwenty-one hospitals in other states there were 18,336 admissions, of\r\nwhich 492, or 2.68 per cent, were cases of arteriosclerosis. On the\r\nother hand, the Massachusetts hospitals show 9.63 per cent of their\r\nfirst admissions during 1919 as arteriosclerotic psychoses. There would\r\nappear to be no way to harmonize these dissimilar findings unless it\r\nis merely a question of differentiation between the senile psychoses\r\nand those due to arteriosclerosis. In a total of 70,987 admissions to\r\nall institutions, there were 3,100 cases of arteriosclerotic psychoses,\r\na percentage of 4.36. It is worthy of note that in all of the various\r\ngroups of institutions the percentage of senile and arteriosclerotic\r\ncases combined is practically the same. This would strongly suggest\r\nvarying standards of diagnosis which will undoubtedly be reconciled in\r\ntime. It is only recently that any great amount of attention has been\r\ngiven to the psychoses due to arteriosclerosis and it must be confessed\r\nthat there has been entirely too great a tendency to dismiss without\r\nfurther interest as senile psychoses all mental disturbances occurring\r\nin persons of advanced years. On the other hand, the custom of basing\r\na diagnosis of arteriosclerotic psychosis on the mere presence of an\r\nincreased blood pressure without the existence of any of the other\r\nsymptoms which characterize that condition indicates, if nothing else,\r\nthe necessity of a greater uniformity in our methods of diagnostic\r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nGENERAL PARALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral paralysis of the insane, general paresis, or dementia\r\nparalytica, as it is variously known, from the standpoint of etiology,\r\nsymptomatology and pathology, is unquestionably the most clearly\r\ndifferentiated and sharply circumscribed of the psychoses at this\r\ntime. Its history, like its pathology, is inseparable from that of\r\nsyphilis—a subject of never failing interest and importance, from the\r\ntime of the first appearance of that word in a poem (Syphilidis, sive\r\nmorbi Gallici) written by the Italian physician and poet Fracastoro\r\nin 1530. Guarinoni referred to epilepsies due to syphilis in the\r\nseventeenth century. Frequent allusions are made in the literature of\r\nthat period to manifestations of the disease in the nervous system.\r\nThomas Willis called attention to the association of paralysis with\r\nmental disorders as early as 1672. A form of mania due to syphilis was\r\ndescribed by Sanché in 1777. Jelliffe found references in literature\r\nto a specific leptomeningitis in 1766 and paraplegias in 1771. Haslam,\r\na pharmacist at the Bethlem Hospital, is said to have given a fairly\r\naccurate description of general paresis in 1798. A French writer, A.\r\nL. Bayle, is usually spoken of as having clearly differentiated the\r\ndisease in 1822. The work of Calmeil, \"De la Paralysie Consididérée\r\nchez les aliénés,\" in 1826, was, however, the first elaborate\r\nmonograph ever written on this important psychosis and established its\r\nrecognition as an entity. Griesinger looked upon it as a combination of\r\ndifferent mental conditions. Esquirol is credited with having been the\r\nfirst to describe the speech defect now considered such an important\r\nsymptom. Baillarger is said to have introduced the term dementia\r\nparalytica in 1846.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of the disease was a subject of controversy for many\r\nyears. The early writers ascribed it to sexual excesses, masturbation,\r\nalcoholism, heredity, overwork, and various other causes. It was looked\r\nupon by some as one of the sequelae of syphilis and was described as a\r\n\"meta syphilitic\" disease by Möbius and a \"para syphilitic\" disorder\r\nby Fournier. It was noted by many as occurring only in the more\r\nintellectual and highly developed races and was therefore referred\r\nto by Krafft-Ebing as a disease of \"syphilization and civilization.\"\r\nBoth Bayle and Esquirol mentioned syphilis very casually in their\r\nwritings. Sandras in 1852 spoke of it as one of the principal causes\r\nof general paresis. Its etiological importance was, however, first\r\ngiven serious consideration by Esmarch and Jessen, prominent Danish\r\nwriters, in 1857. Their views were corroborated by Steenberg in 1860\r\nand by Kjellberg in 1863. The theory of an exclusively specific origin\r\nwas not generally accepted, however, for many years. Rieger published\r\nelaborate statistics in 1886 showing that the incidence of general\r\nparesis was sixteen or seventeen times as great in syphilitics as it\r\nwas in healthy persons. The fact that a definite history of infection\r\nwas not available in many cases led to considerable doubt. Such eminent\r\nauthorities as Charcot, Binswanger and Déjerine went so far as to\r\ndeny that there was any relation between the two diseases. That some\r\nuncertainty was warranted by the information at hand is shown by the\r\nfact that Kraepelin[169] found a history of syphilis in seventy-eight\r\nper cent of his cases, while Sprengeler reported 41.5 per cent, Räcke\r\n57.3 per cent, Torkel fifty-one per cent, Marcus seventy-six per cent,\r\nHoughberg 86.9 per cent, and Alzheimer over ninety per cent. This is\r\nnot at all surprising in view of the statement made by Kraepelin[170]\r\nthat Hirschl could find a definite history of an initial lesion in\r\nonly thirty-six per cent of his cases of tertiary syphilis. Hudovernig\r\nfound that 42.3 per cent of the women suffering from syphilis did\r\nnot know when they were infected. In discussing this subject in 1897\r\nKrafft-Ebing reported the inoculation of nine paretics with syphilitic\r\nvirus without the appearance of luetic symptoms in any instance,\r\nalthough reinfections have been mentioned by other authorities.\r\n\r\nOne of the first advances which contributed materially to the\r\nultimate solution of the general paresis problem was the study of the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid by Widal, Sicard and others after the introduction\r\nof lumbar puncture by Quincke in 1890. This led eventually to\r\ndiscoveries which were of great diagnostic importance. The isolation\r\nof the spirochaeta pallidum, now known as the treponema pallidum, by\r\nSchaudinn in 1905 settled the question for all time as to the cause\r\nof syphilis. The adaptation of the principle of complement fixation,\r\nthe so-called Bordet-Gengon phenomenon, to the study of syphilitic\r\nfluids by Wassermann, Neisser and Bruck in 1906 practically removed all\r\ndoubt as to the relation between that disease and general paresis. The\r\ndemonstration of the treponema in the cortex of paretics by Moore and\r\nNoguchi in 1913 was practically the only other contribution necessary.\r\nThey have since been found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that general paresis must now be looked upon as being a\r\nmanifestation of syphilis beyond all peradventure of a doubt, it is\r\nnevertheless true that we are unable to explain why that disease does\r\nnot always yield to specific treatment. This is undeniably the case at\r\nthis time. Just why this should be so cannot be explained in the light\r\nof our present knowledge. It is, however, presumably for the same reason\r\n that tabes and other diseases of the cord and nervous system,\r\nthe specific origin of which cannot logically be questioned, are\r\nequally resistant to salvarsan and mercury, whatever that reason may be.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the findings of the Wassermann reaction became evident,\r\nrenewed efforts on the part of clinicians to find a cure for general\r\nparesis naturally followed. One of the first suggested was the\r\nSwift-Ellis treatment. This was based on the injection of salvarsanized\r\nblood serum into the subdural space of the spinal canal. Results were\r\nexceedingly encouraging for a while, but time showed that this was\r\nnot the solution of the problem. Intravenous salvarsan administration\r\nwas next tried. This, too, gave excellent results at first. The cases\r\nwhich were apparently cured, however, eventually relapsed sooner or\r\nlater in almost every instance. The intraspinous use of salvarsan in\r\nminute doses has been no more successful than the Swift-Ellis method.\r\nIntracranial subdural treatments have been tried and salvarsan has\r\neven been injected directly into the lateral ventricles. The logical\r\nconclusion is either that the destruction of the nervous tissue has\r\nalready reached a stage which is beyond repair or that the treatment\r\ndoes not reach the site of the disease.\r\n\r\nClinically we are on much safer ground. In his third\r\nedition Krafft-Ebing[171] referred to dementia paralytica as\r\n\"periencephalomeningitis diffusa,\" the term originally employed by\r\nCalmeil. \"Clinically this disease is manifested as a rule as a chronic\r\ndisease of the brain with vasomotor, psychic, and motor, functional\r\ndisturbances, progressive in course, with a duration of from two to\r\nthree years and nearly always a fatal termination.\"\r\n\r\nRégis,[172] before the cause of the disease was definitely\r\ndetermined, defined general paralysis as a \"cerebral disorder,\r\nsometimes cerebro-spinal (diffuse chronic interstitial\r\nmeningo-myelo-encephalitis) essentially characterized by progressive\r\nsymptoms of dementia and paralysis (paralytic dementia) with which\r\nare frequently associated various accessory symptoms, and especially\r\nan insanity of the maniacal, melancholic, or circular type (paralytic\r\ninsanity).\"\r\n\r\nSince the time the disease was described by Bayle, general paresis\r\nhas usually been spoken of as being represented clinically by three\r\ndifferent stages. White[173] speaks of a prodromal period, one of full\r\ndevelopment and a terminal stage. In the first period he emphasizes\r\nthe importance of physical symptoms, more particularly the oculomotor\r\nand tendon reflex disturbances. These include the sluggish reaction\r\nto light (28.3 per cent) or an actual Argyll-Robertson pupil (45\r\nper cent), with an increased, decreased or absent knee-jerk, the\r\nexaggerated form being the most common. The mental symptoms may be\r\nentirely overlooked in the first stage. There is a gradual progressive\r\ndeterioration of the personality, with a loss of efficiency,\r\nimpairment of memory, and failure of judgment. There may be episodes\r\nof excitement, depression or delirium, with or without hallucinations\r\nand delusions, the latter being either hypochondriacal or grandiose.\r\n\"The demented type, without marked delusions or sensory falsifications,\r\nis the truly typical variety of the disease and the dementia the\r\nbasal element of all forms\" (White). There may be an incipient speech\r\ndisorder and beginning tremor.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic of the second stage is a marked increase of the physical\r\nsymptoms already described, together with the appearance of seizures.\r\nMuscular weakness develops and the patient often shows a marked gain in\r\nweight. The mental symptoms are merely an exacerbation of those shown\r\nin the first stage. The expansive variety constitutes the classic form\r\nso often spoken of. There may be agitations, depressions, alternations\r\nof these symptoms or even paranoid forms.\r\n\r\nIn the third stage there is a continued exaggeration of the physical\r\nsigns of the disease with an advancing mental deterioration. The\r\npatient becomes helpless and practically speechless, contractures\r\nand bedsores develop, and death often occurs as the result of an\r\nunusually violent seizure. The description of this disease in the\r\nthree traditional stages so often referred to is practically without\r\nsignificance and of very questionable value. It is, of course, a\r\nwell-known fact that the disease may progress rapidly to a termination\r\nin two or three years or may continue for an almost indefinite period\r\nof time. It may manifest itself, furthermore, in various ways. The\r\nphysical signs show much greater constancy than the mental symptoms.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[174] describes demented, depressed, expansive and agitated\r\nforms of general paresis. The \"demented\" form he finds to be much\r\nmore common than the others. This is characterized by a progressive\r\nmental deterioration with \"paralysis.\" The onset is marked by a poverty\r\nof thought, forgetfulness, moodiness, instability and indifference.\r\nConsciousness gradually becomes somewhat clouded and the patient\r\nmore or less disoriented. Transitory delusions supervene. These are\r\nof a depressive type, somatic or expansive in nature. The delusional\r\nideas as a general rule are rather childish. Memory disorder becomes\r\nconspicuous and delirious excitements occur at times. All of this leads\r\nto a gradual deterioration. Speech defects appear sooner or later and\r\nconduct disorders are common. Kraepelin finds that fifty-three per\r\ncent of his Heidelberg cases were of the demented form. At Munich they\r\nconstituted fifty-six per cent of the men and seventy-three per cent\r\nof the women. Forty-four per cent of the cases died within the first\r\ntwo years.\r\n\r\nThe \"depressive\" form of paresis as described by Kraepelin is\r\ncharacterized by emotional depression or anxiety with delusions of\r\nvarious kinds. It may begin with a general sensation of illness and a\r\ngradual weakness of memory or intellect followed by symptoms of mental\r\ndulness. The unpleasant ideas are hypochondriacal in nature and often\r\nof an extravagant type. The delusions are quite frequently somatic in\r\norigin. Sometimes these are associated with self-accusation or there\r\nmay be complaints of persecution. Hallucinations occur at times. In\r\nspite of this deplorable state of affairs a marked indifference on\r\nthe part of the patient is the rule. Excitement, violence or suicidal\r\nimpulses nevertheless occur, and stuporous states are described.\r\nKraepelin found that the depressive form constituted twelve per cent\r\nof his cases at Heidelberg. He is of the opinion that the duration is\r\nshort, much more so than in some of the other types of the disease.\r\nFifty-eight and six-tenths per cent died within the first two years.\r\nConvulsions, however, were less frequent.\r\n\r\nThe \"expansive form,\" according to Kraepelin, may begin with an\r\ninitial depression or show excitement early. Megalomanic symptoms of\r\nthe most extravagant variety soon appear. The marked mental weakness\r\nis, however, very manifest. Hallucinations of sight and hearing\r\nare frequently present but transitory. The mood is usually happy,\r\nalthough hypochondriacal ideas occur for short periods now and then.\r\nExcitability is more common, sometimes with unusual violence. The\r\ncourse tends to a complete deterioration, with occasional exacerbations\r\nof excitement. Kraepelin found that the expansive form constituted\r\nabout thirty per cent of his Heidelberg cases. Convulsions were less\r\nfrequent and remissions more common than in other types. He found that\r\nthis form of the disease, moreover, occurred later in life. Forty per\r\ncent died within the first two years. Some cases, on the other hand,\r\nwere of long duration; one of seven, another of eight, and one of\r\nfourteen years. He also noted mixed varieties with alternations between\r\nexcitement and depression.\r\n\r\nThe \"agitated\" form as described by Kraepelin is that type in which\r\nextreme excitements predominate. It is often of sudden onset. Grandiose\r\nideas, even more extravagant than those of the expansive form, appear.\r\nA flight of ideas may be observed at times and stupor often intervenes.\r\nThe most severe cases are those which have been referred to by some\r\nwriters as \"galloping\" paresis. An actual delirium may lead to an early\r\ntermination in death. The agitated type constituted 6.3 per cent of\r\nKraepelin's cases. He finds this condition somewhat analogous to the\r\ndelirious states due to alcoholism.\r\n\r\nRemissions are more common in the agitated and expansive forms of the\r\ndisease and may vary in duration from a few months in some instances\r\nto one of fourteen years reported by Dobrschansky. Nissl confirmed\r\nthe diagnosis of paresis at autopsy in a case observed by Tuczek\r\nwhich had been stationary for nearly twenty years. Alzheimer reported\r\nanother with a known duration of thirty-two years. Kraepelin has found,\r\nhowever, that fifty per cent of his paretics die within the first two\r\nyears. He reports unequal pupils in from fifty to sixty per cent of\r\nthose examined. He also finds that pupillary irregularity is one of the\r\nearliest physical signs in many individuals. Complete loss of light\r\nreaction was found in from fifty to sixty per cent of all cases, with\r\na reduced range of reaction in from thirty to forty per cent. He found\r\nepileptiform or other attacks present in from thirty to forty per cent\r\nof those studied. Decreased or absent patellar reflexes were noted\r\nabout twice as often as were increased reflexes. In from two-thirds\r\nto three-fourths of all cases he found both the posterior column and\r\nlateral tracts of the cord involved.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic physical signs noted in all textbooks are described\r\nin detail by Kraepelin[175] as common to all of the clinical forms of the\r\ndisease. The inequality, irregularity and immobility of the pupils,\r\nthe speech defect, difficulty in writing, tremor of the lips, facial\r\nmuscles and tongue, the marked changes in both superficial and deep\r\nreflexes, the alterations in the gait, the muscular incoordination,\r\nthe presence of the Babinski reflex or ankle clonus, the sensory,\r\nmotor, vasomotor and trophic disturbances constitute a combination of\r\nphysical signs which is to be found practically nowhere else within the\r\ndomain of psychiatry. The seizures, either epileptiform, apoplectiform\r\nor resembling syncopes, are almost pathognomonic when taken into\r\nconsideration with the physical signs alone.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid is from three to five times as\r\ngreat as in normal individuals. The albumen content of the fluid is\r\nincreased about six times (Kraepelin). The increase in the globulin\r\ncontent has been very frequently referred to in the literature of\r\ngeneral paresis. Kraepelin states that it also occurs in tabes,\r\nsyphilis, brain abscess, occasional cases of extra medullary tumors,\r\nmultiple sclerosis and in some infectious diseases. He attaches a great\r\ndeal of importance to the increase in the cellular elements of the\r\nspinal fluid. \"Cases with repeated normal findings are so rare that the\r\ncorrectness of the diagnosis may be justly doubted.\" The Wassermann\r\nfindings no longer require comment. The colloidal gold test of Lange\r\nis equally well known. Nowhere else in psychiatric procedure does the\r\nlaboratory render such valuable diagnostic assistance as is the rule in\r\ncases of general paresis. A positive Wassermann reaction in the spinal\r\nfluid, the presence of an increase in the albumen and globulin\r\ncontent, with a marked lymphocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid and a\r\npositive gold test, is quite sufficient evidence on which to base a\r\ndefinite diagnosis. The results of an examination of the spinal fluid\r\nfor diagnostic purposes at the time of autopsy are highly unreliable.\r\nAn increase in the cell count, which may be misleading, is found in\r\nthe spinal fluid of non-paretics in all cases after death. The number\r\nof cells depends entirely on the time of examination. It is not at\r\nall unusual to find from one to three hundred per cubic millimeter\r\nwhen a count is made from twenty-four to forty-eight hours after\r\nthe death of the patient.[176] Another interesting fact is that the\r\npresence of sugar always shown by Fehling's solution during life\r\ncannot be demonstrated postmortem, at least after the lapse of a few\r\nhours.[177] The significance of this change is not clear. Nor is the\r\nincrease in the globulin content of the spinal fluid, when taken alone,\r\npathognomonic of either general paresis or syphilis, as was pointed\r\nout in 1909.[178] One of the most elaborate studies ever made of the\r\nspinal fluid, that of F. W. Mott, shows that this increase is due to\r\ndegenerative processes of the nervous system which may be due to a\r\nvariety of causes.[179]\r\n\r\nIn no other psychosis do we find such clear-cut pathological findings\r\nat autopsy as are readily demonstrable in general paresis. We are very\r\nlargely indebted to the exhaustive researches of Nissl and Alzheimer,\r\n(1904)[180] for our information on this subject. Macroscopically\r\nadhesions of the dura to the calvarium and of the pia to the cortical\r\nsubstance are quite common. Opacities of the meninges are practically\r\nalways present. Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica, externa or interna, is\r\ncommon, often with the formation of extensive hemorrhagic membranes.\r\nEpendymitis may be readily observed in the floor of the fourth and\r\nlateral ventricles. There is usually a reduction in the general brain\r\nweight, with atrophy of various parts, usually one side or the other\r\nof the cerebrum. The sulci are widened and the frontal lobes are often\r\nnoticeably smaller in size. Less frequently the temporal, parietal\r\nor occipital regions are affected. Often there are localized foci of\r\natrophy with cyst formation. The ventricles are frequently widely\r\ndilated, with an increase of cerebrospinal fluid.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination always shows a more or less diffuse\r\nleptomeningitis with a markedly thickened pia infiltrated with\r\nlymphocytes and plasma cells. In the superficial layers of the cortex\r\nthere is a neuroglia proliferation with characteristic \"spider cells.\"\r\nThere is an obvious disturbance of the normal layering of the cortex\r\nwhich is very striking. The adventitia of the vascular walls shows\r\nan extensive infiltration by lymphocytes and particularly by plasma\r\ncells which are often very numerous. Rod cells or \"stäbchenzellen\"\r\nas described by Alzheimer are very noticeable as are also satellite\r\ncells or free nuclei. The neurones are often diminished in number\r\nand frequently show the \"acute\" or \"grave\" alterations described\r\nby Nissl, as well as shrinkage, sclerosis, pigmentary deposits,\r\nvacuolization, etc. The characteristic axonal alteration originally\r\ndescribed by Turner as occurring in central neuritis is sometimes\r\nobserved. Degeneration of the nerve fibres may be brought out by\r\nproper staining processes. Intimal thickening of the vessel walls and\r\na capillary proliferation or budding should also be mentioned. Foci\r\nof softening sometimes are to be found in the cortex. The presence\r\nof occasional gummata is now conceded, although formerly denied by\r\nAlzheimer. The changes in the cerebellum are not essentially different,\r\nbut are usually not so conspicuous. In the cord a pachymeningitis and\r\nleptomeningitis are usually present, as well as the vascular changes\r\ndescribed above. The important findings, however, are the degeneration\r\nof the posterior columns and lateral tracts, or mixed forms involving\r\nboth of these. Owing doubtless to defects in staining technique, the\r\ndemonstration of the treponema is difficult and unsatisfactory. It\r\nmust be admitted that some of the above histopathological changes in\r\nthemselves, the cell alterations, for instance, do not, when considered\r\nalone, prove the existence of general paresis. The whole picture as\r\nshown by the microscope, however, leaves no room for argument. The\r\npostmortem diagnosis is absolutely conclusive.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the subject of general paresis without some\r\nreference to the juvenile form, first described by Clouston in 1877,\r\nwould be manifestly incomplete. Although this term may be applied\r\nto a type of the disease acquired in childhood, it is usually used\r\nas referring to hereditary syphilis. Symptoms generally appear at\r\nor before the age of puberty. As a general rule the child is more\r\nor less defective mentally from birth, although this is not always\r\ntrue. Ordinarily the course of the disease is one of progressive\r\ndeterioration, with an occasional episode of excitement. Convulsive\r\nseizures are frequent, and contractures are often noted. These cases\r\nare likely to be mistaken for idiocy and overlooked. The duration\r\nusually extends over a period of several years. The pathology is\r\npractically the same as that of the adult form of the disease. Almost\r\ninvariably a positive Wassermann is obtained on examining the blood of\r\nthe parents. It is equally interesting to note that the children of\r\nsyphilitic parents often show a positive Wassermann reaction without\r\nany evidence of paresis, or at least for some time before it develops.\r\n\r\nThe only question remaining at this time is whether general paresis\r\nand cerebral syphilis are separate and distinct disease entities. For\r\nmany years this was held to be the case. Certainly gummata and other\r\nsyphilitic processes are to be found in the brain where there is no\r\nsuch pathological picture as characterizes general paresis. In any\r\nevent the latter must be recognized as a very well defined form of\r\nsyphilis of the nervous system. In view of the very definite etiology,\r\nsymptomatology and pathology of general paresis, the various clinical\r\ndifferentiations of Kraepelin and other writers are looked upon by many\r\nas not being of very great importance. In any and all clinical types,\r\nhowever described, we are unquestionably dealing with the same sharply\r\ncircumscribed disease process. This subject is one of academic interest\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association in its classification of psychoses\r\nmade no attempt to differentiate types. For purposes of statistical\r\nstudy the following suggestions appear in the manual:—\r\n\r\n\"The range of symptoms encountered in general paralysis is too great\r\nto be reviewed here in detail. As to mental symptoms, most stress\r\nshould be laid on the early changes in disposition and character,\r\njudgment defects, difficulty about time relations and discrepancies in\r\nstatements, forgetfulness and later on a diffuse memory impairment.\r\nCases with marked grandiose trends are less likely to be overlooked\r\nthan cases with depressions, paranoid ideas, alcoholic-like episodes,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\"Mistakes of diagnosis are most apt to be made in those cases having\r\nin the early stages pronounced psychotic symptoms and relatively\r\nslight defect symptoms, or in cases with few definite physical signs.\r\nLumbar puncture should always be made if there is any doubt about\r\nthe diagnosis. A Wassermann examination of the blood alone is not\r\nsufficient as this does not tell us whether or not the central nervous\r\nsystem is involved.\"\r\n\r\nA study of the statistics of the thirteen New York state hospitals\r\nin the \"pre-Wassermann\" days and before we had acquired our present\r\naccurate knowledge of the pathology of general paresis shows that there\r\nwere 84,152 admissions during the fourteen years ending on October\r\n1, 1888. Of this number 5,697, or 6.76 per cent, were diagnosed as\r\ngeneral paresis. In the same hospitals, from 1912 to 1919 inclusive,\r\n6,374 cases of general paresis were reported,—12.71 per cent of\r\nthe 49,640 first admissions. During the years 1918 and 1919 that\r\ndisease constituted 13.19 per cent of all admissions. This apparent\r\nincrease undoubtedly is due to the fact that modern methods have\r\nmaterially improved facilities for accuracy of diagnosis. It is not\r\nat all probable that the admission rate has doubled during the period\r\nin question for any other reason. In the Massachusetts hospitals\r\nduring the year 1919, only 7.90 per cent of the first admissions were\r\ndiagnosed as general paresis. There was, however, an unusually high\r\nrate of cerebral syphilis. In twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other\r\nstates, reports based on the present classification show a total of\r\n18,336 admissions, mostly in 1917, 1918 and 1919. Of this number 1,233,\r\nor 6.72 per cent, were cases of general paresis. Thus, in a total of\r\n70,987 admissions based on the present classification of psychoses as\r\nused by the American Psychiatric Association there were 7,845 cases\r\nof general paresis in all,—a percentage of 11.05. It is, of course,\r\na well-known fact that general paresis is largely a psychosis of\r\ndensely populated communities. This is readily shown by the New York\r\nstatistics. During the year 1919, 9.6 per cent of the admissions at\r\nBinghamton were cases of general paresis. The percentage at Buffalo\r\nwas 15.5; at Gowanda, 17.3; Hudson River (Poughkeepsie), 9.0; at\r\nMiddletown, 3.7; Rochester, 8.6; St. Lawrence (Ogdensburg), 9.2;\r\nUtica, 10.1; and Willard, 13. In the institutions caring for the insane\r\nof New York City 16.3 per cent were reported at the Manhattan State\r\nHospital, 13.5 per cent at Kings Park, and 14.7 per cent at Central\r\nIslip. The percentage at the other institutions, except at Buffalo\r\nand Gowanda, which care almost entirely for residents of the city of\r\nBuffalo, is determined very largely by the transfer of patients from\r\nthe hospitals of New York City and the metropolitan district. General\r\nparesis constitutes approximately ten per cent of the commitments in\r\nthe city of Boston. On the other hand, we find an admission rate of\r\n2.3 per cent for the Vermont State Hospital (1917 and 1918), 1.5 per\r\ncent for the Central State Hospital, Virginia (1919), 2.5 per cent for\r\nthe Columbia State Hospital (South Carolina) (1918), and a period of\r\ntwo years at the Spencer State Hospital, West Virginia (1917 and 1918)\r\nwith 262 admissions and no cases of general paresis. Of 2,895 first\r\nadmissions reported by the Ohio state hospitals for the year ending\r\nJune 30, 1920, 438, or 15.12 per cent, were cases of general paresis.\r\nIt is interesting, at least, to note that Letelier[181] showed an\r\nadmission rate for this disease of seven per cent at the Casa de Orates\r\nat Santiago, Chili.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH CEREBRAL SYPHILIS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indications are at the present time that the psychiatry of the\r\nfuture will not deal with a consideration of general paralysis and\r\ncerebral syphilis, as such, but will differentiate preferably between\r\nparenchymatous and interstitial, or mesoblastic, syphilitic processes\r\nof the nervous system. The retention of the designation general\r\nparesis is little, if anything, more than a concession to the claims\r\nof tradition. Cerebral syphilis may be said in a general way at this\r\ntime to include all syphilitic involvements of the brain other than\r\ngeneral paresis, which must be accorded the precedence due to priority\r\nof recognition if nothing else. In the light of our present knowledge\r\nwe may speak in rather definite terms in considering cerebral syphilis\r\nfrom the standpoint of pathology. On an anatomical basis it is usually\r\ndivided into three forms,—the meningitic, the endarteritic and the\r\ngummatous types. It is, of course, not to be understood that these\r\nrepresent separate and distinct processes. Combined forms are nearly\r\nalways to be expected and the different types practically always\r\ncoexist more or less.\r\n\r\nThe onset of the disease may be expected anywhere from one to ten or\r\neven fifteen years from the date of the initial lesion. The early\r\nappearance of cerebral symptoms would indicate brain syphilis as\r\na general rule rather than general paresis. Oppenheim[182] in his\r\nsecond edition says that cerebral syphilis often develops within a\r\nyear after infection, a majority of the cases being noted within two\r\nyears. He finds it a very rare occurrence after ten years. \"Because,\"\r\nas Barker[183] puts it, \"of the lawlessness of the occurrence of\r\nsyphilitic lesions in the central nervous system, all clinical\r\nclassifications of these cases are based only on the predominance\r\nof certain associations of lesions.\" Certainly the pathology of the\r\ndisease is quite varied in its manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe meningeal form is the one most often encountered. This may appear\r\non the convexity or on the base of the brain and is spoken of as\r\nbeing either localized or diffuse in character. It may or may not be\r\nassociated with gummatous formations or cortical vascular involvement.\r\nThe essential process is a leptomeningitis. The pia is thickened,\r\nopaque and adherent to the cortex. The microscope shows the presence\r\nof inflammatory elements consisting largely of lymphocytes and plasma\r\ncells which may be confined entirely to the meninges or may extend\r\ndownward to the superficial cortical layers directly or by extension\r\nalong the adventitial sheaths of the vessels. An examination of the\r\ncortex, however, shows a limitation of this invasion to the immediate\r\nneighborhood of the meninges. The cortical involvement, in other words,\r\nis entirely secondary and is not the important part of the pathological\r\npicture that it always is in general paresis. The meningeal condition\r\nis practically the same in the two diseases but more likely to be\r\nlocalized in syphilitic processes. Dunlap[184] calls attention to\r\nthe important fact that in a group of cases occurring many years\r\nafter infection he found involvements of the deeper cortical layers\r\nstrongly suggesting general paresis pathologically and impossible of\r\ndifferentiation clinically. In these cases, even in the deep cortical\r\nvessel walls, occasional lymphoid and plasma cells were found, as\r\nwell as typical syphilitic endarteritis in some instances. There is\r\nfrequently, in addition to the simple meningeal involvement at the\r\nbase, a widespread gummatous infiltration of the pia-arachnoid or in\r\nsome instances numerous miliary granulomas. This is especially common\r\nin the region of the chiasm and may involve the origin of various\r\ncranial nerves, obviously in such cases determining the symptomatology\r\nto be expected. The optic and oculomotor nerves particularly are\r\naffected. The large vessels at the base are often involved either by\r\nsyphilitic inflammatory processes or by direct invasion of their walls\r\nby gummas. An extensive specific meningo-encephalitis may lead either\r\nto foci or extensive areas of actual softening.\r\n\r\nThe endarteritis which occurs in syphilis is characteristic and\r\ndiagnostic. This has been studied exhaustively by Heubner. The smaller\r\nvessels show an infiltration of lymphoid and plasma cells in their\r\nadventitia, as well as in the perivascular lymph spaces. The larger\r\nvessels show a great thickening of the intima which is consecutive, or,\r\nas Lambert described it, \"girdling\" in character. This is associated\r\nwith a splitting of the membrana elastica. The proliferated intimal\r\ntissue is very susceptible to degenerative processes. Thrombosis and\r\nthe formation of anemic infarctions may follow the obliteration of\r\nthe vascular channels. The involvement of the larger vessels may lead\r\nto very distinctive focal symptoms. Thus, as Barker[185] has pointed\r\nout, there may be an obliterating process in the middle cerebral with\r\nhemiplegia and aphasia, invasion of the basilar artery with pontile or\r\nbulbar symptoms, or an involvement of the posterior cerebral may\r\nlead to hemianesthesia or hemianopsia, while an affection of the\r\nvertebral may show a unilateral bulbar paralysis with hemianesthesia\r\nof the same side and a hemiplegia of the opposite side. The extensive\r\ninvolvements of the base are usually meningeal, with gumma formation\r\nand with a secondary endarteritis in addition. Large solitary gummata\r\nmay, moreover, occur practically anywhere in the brain, although\r\nthey are somewhat unusual. On microscopical examination they show a\r\ncharacteristic infiltration of the periphery and a caseous center. They\r\nare more likely to occur in the course of a large vessel.\r\n\r\nThe symptomatology of brain syphilis necessarily varies with the\r\nnature, extent and location of the lesion. In the earlier stages of\r\na diffuse meningitis the prominent symptoms to be expected first are\r\nheadache and dizziness. In an individual with a definite specific\r\nhistory a persistence of such symptoms should suggest salvarsan\r\ntherapy. Vomiting is a common complication. Cranial nerve palsies,\r\noptic neuritis or hemiplegia in such a case would, of course, be\r\nconclusive. Stuporous, confused or delirious states may occur, with or\r\nwithout hallucinations. When the syphilitic process is an extensive\r\none with a widespread meningitis or gummatous involvement of the base,\r\nnumerous focal symptoms are to be expected. Choked disc, optic tract\r\nlesions, paralysis of the ocular muscles, facial neuralgias, facial\r\npalsies, deafness, or anesthesias may occur. Mental deterioration\r\nnaturally advances with the progress of the disease, but the\r\npersonality is much better preserved than in general paresis. Periods\r\nof unconsciousness are not infrequent and convulsive attacks may\r\nappear. These may be general or local and paralyses often follow. These\r\nmay assume the form of a hemiplegia or may involve only certain groups\r\nof muscles. Ptosis is often noted. Paralysis of other eye muscles is\r\ncommon, and pupillary rigidity is sometimes a symptom. Hemianopsia\r\nand diplopia are often observed: An important feature of the disease\r\nis the fact that these conditions are more or less transitory and\r\nrarely become permanent. Apoplectiform attacks followed by hemiplegia\r\nare results of gummatous growth or may be associated with areas of\r\nsoftening. These are due to vascular disturbances. Aphasia is not an\r\nunusual occurrence. Hemiplegias appearing suddenly in individuals under\r\nforty years of age are likely to be of specific origin. Epilepsies\r\ndeveloping in later years should always be viewed with suspicion.\r\nThe Korsakow symptom complex has been found in some cases of brain\r\nsyphilis. Memory defect is present in most instances. When a marked\r\nmental deterioration takes place it is usually late in the disease.\r\nArgyll-Robertson pupils are infrequent in cerebral syphilis. Speech\r\ndefect is practically never so conspicuous as it is in general paresis.\r\nWriting difficulties are also much less marked. Euphoria and grandiose\r\ndelusions occasionally occur in brain syphilis but much less frequently\r\nthan in general paresis. Hemiplegias, when they occur, are much more\r\nlikely to be permanent than they are in general paresis. Paranoid\r\ncomplexes are sometimes clinical features of the disease and if they\r\npersist strongly suggest syphilis rather than paresis.\r\n\r\nThere should be a positive Wassermann reaction in the blood serum\r\nof both diseases. It is more persistent, however, in the syphilitic\r\nform. In the spinal fluid the reverse is the case and negative\r\nresults are often noted in cerebral syphilis. There is usually some\r\nincrease sooner or later in the albumen and globulin content in both\r\ndiseases. There may be a lymphocytosis in both, although usually\r\nmuch greater in general paresis. A typical colloidal gold reaction\r\nis more indicative of general paresis than syphilitic conditions.\r\nSeveral clinical groupings have been proposed. Plant, for instance,\r\nspeaks of various forms of mental deterioration, pseudo-paresis,\r\nparanoid types, epileptiform varieties, symptomatic disturbances and\r\naffective reactions suggesting manic-depressive insanity. The important\r\ncontribution made by Kraepelin[186] to the literature of this subject\r\nis worthy of careful study. He describes a syphilitic neurasthenia,\r\na mental disturbance due to the psychic effect of the disease, and\r\nvarious conditions resulting from gummatous growths. His most important\r\ngroup is a syphilitic pseudo-paralysis, which he divides into a simple\r\ndementia, delirious forms, expansive types and a variety showing\r\nthe characteristic Korsakow syndrome. He also speaks of syphilitic\r\napoplexies and epilepsy, tabetic psychoses and syphilitic paranoid\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSyphilitic neurasthenia as described by Kraepelin is an affection\r\nwhich is likely to occur early in the disease and manifest itself\r\nshortly after the initial infection. In the milder forms, evidences of\r\nnervousness appear,—difficulty of thought, irritability, disturbances\r\nof sleep, pressure in the head, with indefinite and changeable abnormal\r\nsensations and vague pains. Later, feelings of anxiety, depression,\r\ndizziness, mental dulness, a difficulty in finding words, transient\r\nweaknesses, disturbances of sensation, nausea and a slight rise of\r\ntemperature are observed. He admits that there is some question as\r\nto whether this constitutes a clinical entity and if so, whether it\r\nis directly due to the infectious process or is to be attributed to\r\npsychic disturbances. Nervous reactions of various kinds are to be\r\nfound in syphilitics without psychosis. Thus, Meyer in sixty-one cases\r\nof secondary syphilis found eighteen with sluggish pupils, thirty-two\r\nwith increased reflexes, and twelve with general nervous manifestations\r\nsuch as headache, vertigo, etc., appearing shortly after the period of\r\ninfection. In only five of these patients were there any evidences of\r\nan organic disease. In twelve tertiary cases he found indications of an\r\ninvolvement of the nervous system in only two. In thirty examinations\r\nfollowing lumbar puncture a lymphocytosis and an abnormal protein\r\ncontent were observed. Buttino, in a study of thirty syphilitics,\r\nreported that fourteen showed a diminished light reaction within one\r\nyear of the time of infection. Later, after unmistakable symptoms\r\nof cortical involvement have existed for some time, neurasthenic\r\ncomplexes are common. These take the form of a difficulty of thought,\r\nabsentmindedness, forgetfulness, and a reduction of interests. The mood\r\nmay be irritable, surly, depressed, anxious, fearful, and changeable,\r\nshowing at the same time considerable indifference and dulness.\r\nSome are quiet and reserved while others are excited and violent.\r\nSevere headaches may be common, more often at night. There are also\r\noccasional attacks of dizziness or fainting, disturbances of sensation,\r\nsleeplessness, sensitiveness to alcohol, and occasional diplopia. These\r\nare preliminary to more severe disturbances, which simulate nervous\r\nexhaustion, and are not strikingly unlike the earlier stages of general\r\nparesis. They may be differentiated by examination of the spinal fluid.\r\n\r\nAnother group of cases is characterized by conditions due to an\r\nincreased intracranial pressure. These are marked by thoughtlessness,\r\ndulness, and indifference terminating in a complete lethargy and\r\nsomnolence, during which the patient occasionally demonstrates that he\r\nis not so badly damaged mentally as he appears. Physically there may be\r\nweakness, twitchings, fainting spells, convulsions, ataxias, paralyses,\r\ndysesthesias, choked disc, etc. The basis of this disturbance is a\r\ngummatous growth, its location, of course, largely determining the\r\nsymptoms. Kraepelin suggests the possibility of getting this disease\r\npicture in a syphilitic as the result of a growth of some other kind—a\r\nglioma or endothelioma.\r\n\r\nSlightly more than a third of the cases encountered in his clinic\r\nshowed the symptom-complex which he describes as syphilitic\r\npseudo-paresis. As a rule these cases are of the simple demented\r\ntype with a general mental deterioration. The patients show some\r\ndisturbance of apprehension and attention, tire easily and are quite\r\nforgetful and dull. Delirious states may supervene, with clouding,\r\nconfusion and disorientation, as well as hallucinations of sight and\r\nhearing. Memory is markedly impaired and confabulation may be noted.\r\nJudgment is not so much interfered with as in paresis. The patients\r\nhave some insight into their condition and complain of headache,\r\ndifficulty of thought, etc. Occasional delusions are observed. These\r\nmay be of a hypochondriacal type or grandiose in character. As a rule\r\nthe mood is cheerful, but it may be depressed, anxious or fearful,\r\nwith suicidal tendencies. Sleep is disturbed and there is considerable\r\nrestlessness, usually at night. With all of these symptoms there\r\nare the physical signs of a severe cortical involvement, dizziness,\r\nfainting spells, twitchings, seizures or frank convulsions, occasional\r\nparalyses, etc. Disturbance of sensation and motion may appear with\r\na perfectly clear consciousness at times. Aphasic symptoms are not\r\nuncommon. The eye muscles are affected in many cases, with ptosis,\r\ndouble vision, strabismus, etc. The pupils are usually immobile or\r\nsluggish, frequently only one being involved. The field of vision is\r\nnarrowed and choked disc is common. Speech is affected, as well as\r\nwriting. All kinds of paralyses occur and they persist for some time.\r\nThe gait may be spastic or ataxic. The reflexes are usually increased\r\nand often different on the two sides. Romberg's sign often appears. A\r\nBabinski reflex and ankle clonus may be found. The patients are usually\r\nuntidy in their habits. Blood pressure is increased in some cases and\r\nthe pulse slow. There may be variations in temperature. Often there are\r\nevidences of old syphilitic processes on the skin surface, enlarged\r\nglands, residuals of choroiditis, etc. Usually Kraepelin found a\r\npositive Wassermann reaction in the blood, but not in the spinal fluid,\r\nwhich showed a slight cell increase, often from fifteen to twenty per\r\ncubic millimeter, rarely in larger numbers. He found the course of the\r\ndisease rapid, but with occasional remissions. There may be a sudden\r\ncollapse and death. It usually terminates, however, in a profound\r\ndementia, often with a hemiplegia and epileptiform seizures. There are\r\nother conditions suggesting general paresis. Marcus, for instance,\r\nhas described a delirious, confusional state occurring usually in\r\nthe first year after the infection, sometimes later, but as a rule\r\ndeveloping suddenly. The patients become sleepless, confused, anxious\r\nand disoriented. Numerous hallucinations appear, both of hearing and\r\nvision, usually of a very unpleasant type. The patients often become\r\nexcited and violent or even suicidal. Physical signs more or less\r\nsimilar to those already described are to be expected. According to\r\nMarcus, these cases always respond to syphilitic treatment.\r\n\r\nA small group of cases, as pointed out by Westphal, shows excitements\r\nstrongly simulating the expansive type of general paresis. This form\r\nbegins ordinarily with a depression, sometimes appearing suddenly,\r\nfollowed by irritability, marked restless excitement, headache, and\r\nfainting attacks. Usually there are hallucinations, and delusional\r\nideas of a grandiose type. Above all there are pupillary disturbances,\r\nincreased or decreased reflexes, seizures, paralyses, etc., strongly\r\nresembling paresis. All of these symptoms may disappear under\r\nsyphilitic treatment in time. Some cases, however, last for years,\r\ndying as a rule in a seizure. Kraepelin also describes at some length a\r\ngroup showing the Korsakow complex. He suggests that the fact that this\r\ncondition usually develops in alcoholics is not without significance.\r\n\r\nKraepelin is of the opinion that the mental picture is the conspicuous\r\nand characteristic feature of general paresis standing out more\r\nprominently than the physical evidences of the disease. In syphilitic\r\npseudo-paresis, on the other hand, there is a clearer sensorium without\r\nsuch marked disorientation, and memory is not usually so much affected.\r\nAt the same time, the physical signs are relatively more prominent,\r\nalthough the speech difficulty and writing defects may not be so\r\nmarked. The pupils sometimes show no changes. Hemiplegias with ankle\r\nclonus and a Babinski reflex are, however, disproportionately common.\r\nThe eye muscles are much more often involved than they are in general\r\nparesis. Loss of pain sense is not so noticeable. An advanced form of\r\ndeterioration of many years standing is against a diagnosis of paresis\r\nand favors cerebral syphilis. In these cases the physical signs drop\r\nsomewhat into the background. There are, nevertheless, stationary cases\r\nof general paresis which can be differentiated with great difficulty if\r\nat all. The development of pseudo-paresis is slower and more irregular.\r\nAfter a seizure and a paralysis there may be a long remission. The\r\ndisease, furthermore, does not, like general paresis, always terminate\r\nin death.\r\n\r\nKraepelin finds the apoplectiform type of brain syphilis very common.\r\nAfter a few premonitory symptoms such as headache, dizziness,\r\nirritability, weakness of memory, etc., a typical apoplexy takes place,\r\nleaving a hemiplegia with or without a speech defect. This sometimes\r\noccurs without any loss of consciousness. The patient presents the\r\nappearance of an ordinary hemiplegic with increased reflexes on one\r\nside and ankle clonus followed by a Babinski reflex, etc. Writing is\r\nusually affected as well as speech. There may not be another attack\r\nfor some years. There is, however, a progressive mental deterioration.\r\nOccasional confusional states or excitements may be met with. In\r\nthe meanwhile, numerous physical signs appear, papillary changes,\r\ndisturbances of the reflexes, ptosis, tremors, hemianopsia, etc.\r\nEpileptiform attacks may occur. The blood pressure is usually quite\r\nhigh. There is an increase in the cells in the spinal fluid, often with\r\na negative Wassermann, although the blood serum is positive. Death\r\nusually results from a seizure. Three-fourths of Kraepelin's cases\r\ndeveloped before the age of forty-five, which, of course, assists\r\nmaterially in the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn younger individuals usually, cerebral syphilis may manifest itself\r\nin the form of an epilepsy. Kraepelin is of the opinion that these\r\nconditions usually result from endarteritic involvements. In their\r\ndevelopment they show nothing differing in any way from an ordinary\r\nepilepsy. The attacks are usually mild at first, gradually increasing\r\nin severity, and are much aggravated by alcohol. There are, however,\r\nthe usual physical signs of brain lues and later speech defects appear.\r\nThere is eventually an emotional and intellectual deterioration. The\r\nchanges in the spinal fluid are those described as characteristic of\r\nthe other form of syphilis.\r\n\r\nKraepelin describes the paranoid forms as very uncertain in type and\r\nnot so well defined. Hallucinations and delusions play the principal\r\npart with physical disturbances in the background. They become more or\r\nless prominent, however, eventually. The patient is usually anxious,\r\nrestless, suspicious and develops delusions with characteristic ideas\r\nof jealousy on a sexual basis. Full-fledged persecutory trends also\r\nappear, usually with numerous hallucinations. Occasionally delusions\r\nof sin and self-accusation are noted, although ideas of grandeur\r\nmixed with complaints of persecution are more common. Consciousness\r\nremains undisturbed as a rule and there is no disorientation. The\r\nmood is changeable, at times depressed, tearful, anxious, irritable,\r\ncomplaining, but often cheerful and self-satisfied. There is\r\nusually more or less emotional dulness, with an indifference to the\r\nsurroundings. The emotional life is shallow and superficial. Sudden\r\nexcitements may occur at times with outbursts of anger. There are\r\nusually no striking conduct disorders. There may be occasional seizures\r\nof a mild form, fainting attacks, dizziness, rarely epileptiform\r\nattacks or slight apoplectiform symptoms. Sooner or later the physical\r\nsigns of brain syphilis develop. The course of the disease is slow.\r\nSimilar pictures are noted in tabes. The therapeutic test is not to\r\nbe relied upon too strongly in making a diagnosis or differentiating\r\nbetween paresis and syphilis. It must be remembered that after all\r\nwe are dealing here with one disease process. It has been found that\r\nin many syphilitics, even in recent cases, a positive Wassermann\r\nreaction, an increase in the cell count or in the protein content may\r\noccasionally be demonstrated in the spinal fluid.\r\n\r\nIn a study of 428 cases of neurosyphilis treated in Boston, Raeder[187]\r\nreported that 129, or practically thirty per cent, showed definite\r\nimprovement, both physical and mental. He did not make any extravagant\r\nclaims as to final results to be expected. \"The therapia praesens of\r\nneurosyphilis is but a transition state in rational syphilography.\r\nMedical science has discovered several good clues which must be\r\nfollowed up; and others ferreted out and run down before the solution\r\nof the problem is complete. Indeed the successful treatment of\r\nparesis and tabes, as well as general vascular syphilis and visceral\r\ntertiaries, such as the crippling cradio-pathia, etc., may ultimately\r\nbe realized in the field of preventive medicine. With chemotherapy,\r\nhowever, Ehrlich has doubtless found the most vulnerable approach to\r\nthe treponemiatic diseases, but further research is necessary and other\r\ncombinations must be found before the life of this anthropophagus pest\r\nis successfully snuffed out.\"\r\n\r\nWarthin[188] at autopsy found evidences of active syphilis in a series\r\nof forty-one inactive or \"cured\" cases investigated by him. Eleven of\r\nthese had been treated, were supposed to have recovered and showed\r\nno syphilitic manifestations at the time of death. Five had received\r\nan extended course of salvarsan therapy and in twenty-five there\r\nwas no history of syphilis at all. Spirochaetes were demonstrated\r\nby the Levaditi method in thirty-six of the forty-one cases—in the\r\naorta in thirty-two, in the testes in thirty-one, in the liver in\r\nfour, in the adrenals in six, in the pancreas in six, in the spleen\r\nin one and in the nervous system in five. In some of these cases the\r\nWassermann reaction was reported as negative. Warthin concluded that\r\ncured syphilis in many if not all instances is in a latent condition,\r\nspirochaetes of a low virulence still remaining active.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of statistical study the American Psychiatric Association\r\nhas not attempted any clinical differentiation of the various types\r\nof this disease, a procedure which was felt to be inadvisable at\r\nthis time. The following suggestions appear in the manual as to the\r\nclassification of psychoses due to cerebral syphilis:—\r\n\r\n\"Since general paralysis itself is now known to be a parenchymatous\r\nform of brain syphilis, the differentiation of the cerebral\r\nsyphilis cases might on theoretical grounds be regarded as less\r\nimportant than formerly. Practically, however, the separation of the\r\nnon-parenchymatous forms is very important because the symptoms, the\r\ncourse and therapeutic outlook in most of these cases are different\r\nfrom those of general paralysis.\r\n\r\n\"According to the predominant pathological characteristics, three types\r\nof cerebral syphilis may be distinguished, viz.: (a) Meningitic, (b)\r\nEndarteritic, and (c) Gummatous. The lines of demarcation between\r\nthese types are not, however, sharp ones. We practically always find in\r\nthe endarteritic and gummatous types a certain amount of meningitis.\r\n\r\n\"The acute meningitic form is the most frequent type of cerebral\r\nsyphilis and gives little trouble in diagnosis; many of these cases\r\ndo not reach state hospitals. In most cases after prodromal symptoms\r\n(headache, dizziness, etc.) there is a rapid development of physical\r\nsigns, usually cranial nerve involvement, and a mental picture of\r\ndulness or confusion with few psychotic symptoms except those related\r\nto a delirious or organic reaction.\r\n\r\n\"In the rarer chronic meningitic forms which are apt to occur a long\r\ntime after the syphilitic infection, usually in the period in which\r\nwe might expect general paralysis, the diagnostic difficulties may be\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\"In the endarteritic forms the most characteristic symptoms are those\r\nresulting from focal vascular lesions.\r\n\r\n\"In the gummatous forms the slowly developing focal and pressure\r\nsymptoms are most significant.\r\n\r\n\"In all forms of cerebral syphilis the psychotic manifestations are\r\nless prominent than in general paralysis and the personality is much\r\nbetter preserved as shown by the social reactions, ethical sense,\r\njudgment and general behavior. The grandiose ideas and absurd trends of\r\nthe general paralytic are rarely encountered in these cases.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only of comparatively late years that the hospitals of this\r\ncountry have shown the frequency of psychoses due to cerebral syphilis\r\nin their reports. Statistical studies indicate that such mental\r\nconditions are quite unusual as compared with other well recognized\r\nclinical entities. In a total of 49,640 first admissions reported by\r\nthe New York state hospitals during a period of eight years only 342,\r\nor .67 per cent, were reported as mental diseases due to cerebral\r\nsyphilis. The Massachusetts hospitals during 1919 reported only\r\ntwenty-seven cases, a percentage of .89. Twenty-one hospitals in\r\nfourteen other states, in a total of 18,336 admissions, showed only 124\r\ncases (.67 per cent) of cerebral syphilis. This represents, therefore,\r\na total of 70,987 admissions with only 493 diagnosed as psychoses due\r\nto cerebral syphilis,—a percentage of .69. When this is compared\r\nwith eleven per cent as shown by the admissions for general paresis\r\nit is probably a very fair index of the comparative frequency of the\r\ntwo diseases in our institutions. It is interesting to note that the\r\nincidence of cerebral syphilis as shown by the hospitals of the various\r\nstates is almost exactly the same. The admission rate for the Casa de\r\nOrates in Santiago, Chili, in 1918, as shown by Letelier, was .90 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH HUNTINGTON'S CHOREA, BRAIN TUMOR AND OTHER BRAIN OR\r\nNERVOUS DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nHuntington's chorea is said to have been referred to first by C. O.\r\nWaters of Franklin, N. Y., in Dunglison's \"Practice of Medicine\" in\r\n1842. An article on the subject by Irving W. Lyon also appeared in\r\nthe _American Medical Times_ in 1863. The name by which the disease\r\nis now generally known was the result of an elaborate description of\r\nits symptomatology by George Huntington in the _Medical and Surgical\r\nReporter_ in 1872. He particularly called attention to the fact that\r\nit is hereditary in origin, occurs in adult life, is associated\r\nwith suicidal tendencies and often exhibits mental symptoms. On\r\nthe important subject of heredity Huntington made the following\r\nobservation: \"If one or both of the parents have shown manifestations\r\nof the disease, and more especially when these manifestations have been\r\nof a serious nature, one or more of the offspring almost invariably\r\nsuffer from the disease if they live to adult life; and if by any\r\nchance these children get through life without it, the thread is broken\r\nand the grandchildren or great grandchildren may rest assured that they\r\nare free from the disease. Unstable and whimsical as the disease may\r\nbe in other respects, in this it is firm; it never skips a generation\r\nto manifest itself in another; as soon as it has yielded its claims,\r\nit never regains them.\" A well known monograph on the subject by Osler\r\nappeared in 1894.\r\n\r\nMcCarthy[189] refers to the mental condition associated with this\r\ndisease as \"a severe and gradually progressive deterioration,\r\nultimately ending in absolute dementia. In some cases the mental defect\r\nis noted from the onset of the symptoms, in others the mentality may\r\nremain unimpaired for years. Mental deterioration is the rule, and it\r\nis associated with a loss of memory and a tendency to self-destruction\r\nwhich gradually develops. When the mental degeneration is well marked,\r\noutbreaks of violence are sometimes noted. In one of the writer's\r\npatients, as the disease progressed, the clinical picture of paresis\r\nwas presented. The chronic delusional state is more often noted than\r\nwould be inferred from Huntington's description.\" Hamilton,[190] who\r\nmade a clinical study of a considerable series of cases in 1907,\r\nexpressed the opinion that mental deterioration occurs in the majority\r\nof instances before the onset of choreiform symptoms. He found a\r\nspecial tendency to deterioration in the cases appearing early in\r\nlife, while irritability and delusional ideas were more often observed\r\nin those developing in later years. Delusions of persecution and\r\ndeterioration, however, were symptoms more or less common to both\r\ngroups. Diefendorf,[191] in a study of twenty-eight cases in 1908,\r\ncalled attention particularly to the irritability with occasional\r\noutbursts of violence as well as attacks of despondency. He emphasizes\r\nemotional deterioration and indifference.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[192] also refers to the fact that the mental symptoms may\r\nprecede the choreiform manifestations in appearance, sometimes by a\r\nnumber of years. The patients become forgetful, defective in judgment,\r\nsomewhat dull, show a poverty of thought and an incapacity for orderly\r\nactivities. Generally there is an emotional depression, often with\r\nirritability and more rarely euphoric symptoms. Delusions gradually\r\ndevelop. These are of a persecutory nature, although ideas of grandeur\r\nappear at times. Suicidal tendencies are common. Disturbances of\r\nperception and memory may be very pronounced. The relation of the\r\npatient to his environment becomes very much confused. In some cases,\r\non the other hand, the mental symptoms are not very striking. Anxious\r\nstates, outbursts of anger or emotional excitements may appear at\r\ntimes. Appetite and sleep are often interfered with. The pathology of\r\nthis disease is not characteristic. There may be a chronic meningitis\r\nor extensive atrophies. The cells of the third layer of the cortex,\r\naccording to Kraepelin, are decreased in number with an increase of\r\nglia nuclei. The remaining cells are shrunken with deeply staining\r\nprocesses, and there is a considerable loss of tangential fibres.\r\nSclerotic changes with thickened walls are noted in the blood vessels.\r\nHyaline degeneration and miliary hemorrhages have been observed,\r\nalthough Nissl and Alzheimer found no vascular lesions worthy of note.\r\nThe cortical changes, according to Räcke, are more pronounced in the\r\ncentral convolutions, being much less conspicuous in the frontal and\r\noccipital regions. Alzheimer found the corpus striatum particularly\r\ninvolved. Here he noted a striking cell loss, with glia proliferation\r\nbut no vascular changes. D'Ormea, according to Kraepelin, traced the\r\ndisease through five generations in one family and Browning went as far\r\nback as two hundred years in another.\r\n\r\nThe observations on the subject of Huntington's chorea in the\r\nstatistical manual of the American Psychiatric Association are as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Mental symptoms are a constant accompaniment of this form of chorea\r\nand as a rule become more marked as the disease advances. Although the\r\ndisease is regarded as being hereditary in nature, a diagnosis can be\r\nmade on the clinical picture in the absence of a family history.\r\n\r\n\"The chief mental symptoms are those of mental inertia and an emotional\r\nchange, either apathy and silliness or a depressive irritable reaction\r\nwith a tendency to passionate outbursts. As the disease progresses the\r\nmemory is affected to some extent, but the patient's ability to recall\r\npast events is often found to be surprisingly well preserved when the\r\ndisinclination to cooperate and give information can be overcome.\r\nLikewise the orientation is well retained even when the patient\r\nappears very apathetic and listless. Suspicions and paranoid ideas are\r\nprominent in some cases.\"\r\n\r\nStatistical reports from American institutions show that comparatively\r\nfew cases of Huntington's chorea are committed. In 49,640 first\r\nadmissions to the New York state hospitals only forty-eight, or .09 per\r\ncent, were diagnosed as Huntington's chorea during a period of eight\r\nyears. The admission rate to the Massachusetts hospitals during 1919\r\nwas exactly the same. In twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other states\r\ntwenty-four cases (.13 per cent) in 18,336 admissions were reported as\r\nHuntington's chorea. There were only seventy-five cases (.1 per cent)\r\nin 70,987 admissions to forty-eight hospitals in sixteen different\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psychoses with Brain Tumor_\r\n\r\nBrain tumors are more common perhaps than is generally understood.\r\nCushing[193] shows that they were found in fifty-five, or 1.7 per cent,\r\nof 3,150 autopsies at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. He refers to Siedel,\r\nwho observed them in 1.25 per cent of his cases in Munich and states\r\nthat Blackburn found them in about two per cent of 1,642 autopsies at\r\nthe St. Elizabeths Hospital in Washington. He also quotes Bruns as\r\nsaying that two per cent of all neurological cases show intracranial\r\ngrowths. In the first twenty-five hundred surgical conditions admitted\r\nto the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston eight per cent were\r\ndiagnosed as brain tumor. Cushing found that 66.6 per cent of 130\r\ncarefully studied growths were gliomata. Nearly four per cent were\r\nendotheliomas. In another series of seventy cases he found twenty-seven\r\ngliomas (38.5 per cent), seventeen adenomas (twenty-four per cent),\r\nseven endotheliomas (ten per cent), five interpeduncular and mixed\r\ngrowths (seven per cent), and other forms in smaller percentages. Many\r\nof the endotheliomas have undoubtedly been included in the past with\r\nthe sarcomas. This may also be said of gliomas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cushing, growths in the brain may give rise to no\r\ndisturbance whatever, show well defined focal signs, occasion only\r\ngeneral manifestations, or have both general and focal symptoms,\r\ndepending on the location of the neoplasm. General symptoms may be\r\nbriefly summarized as follows:—headache, vomiting, choked disc,\r\nvertigo, drowsiness, convulsions, disturbances of the pulse rate,\r\nrespiration and temperature, as well as mental disorders. The focal\r\nsigns depend wholly on the site of the growth. Cushing mentions the\r\nfollowing symptom complex as resulting from lesions of the frontal\r\nlobes:—\"Indifference, unpunctuality, mental enfeeblement, loss of\r\nmemory and power of attention, change in disposition with more or less\r\nmarked irritability or taciturnity or obstinacy or jocularity, etc.,\r\noften a rambling speech, lack of realization of the illness, and change\r\nin the general conduct of life with habits of untidiness. These, in\r\ngreater or less degree, characterize most of the cases, although it is\r\noften astonishing to find how inconspicuous the symptoms may be with a\r\nvery extensive growth. They may often be of rather abrupt onset and not\r\nuntil the situation of the lesion is definitely disclosed and careful\r\ninterrogation made into the patient's previous mental state is it\r\npossible to learn that in all probability some mental alteration has\r\nbeen of long standing.\"\r\n\r\nBruns did not find psychoses associated very often with frontal\r\nlesions. Jacobi, however, in reviewing the literature of growths in\r\nthat region, found mental symptoms in forty-nine per cent. Schuster\r\nobserved them in from fifty to sixty per cent of all brain tumors.\r\nRedlich[194] described mental conditions as being either incidental and\r\nnot related to the growth, or definitely caused by it, and was even of\r\nthe opinion that the neoplasm could in some instances be the result of\r\na psychosis. Two of Redlich's patients, moderately alcoholic, showed a\r\ntypical Korsakow syndrome. He refers to the fact that in cases reported\r\nby Oppenheim, Friedrich and Fürstner, \"Witzelsucht,\" or the tendency to\r\njoke, disappeared after growths were removed from the frontal region.\r\nA patient of Begerthal, who had hallucinations, delusions and somatic\r\nsymptoms, recovered after a tubercle was excised from the paracentral\r\nlobule. A case of Friedrich's which showed an alteration of the\r\npersonality, erotic symptoms, sudden explosive laughter, poor memory,\r\netc., recovered after a sarcoma was removed from the right frontal\r\nlobe. A patient of Thoma's after three attacks of mental depression\r\nshowed a gliosarcoma in the occipital lobe at autopsy. Schuster, Bruns\r\nand Schönthal have reported cases of brain tumor with hysterical\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\nRedlich described the psychoses associated with cerebral growths\r\nas being epileptiform in character and origin and resembling\r\npost-epileptic psychoses in their symptomatology, with irritability,\r\nexcitement or violence, confusion, delirium and hallucinations, often\r\nfollowed by partial amnesia. Epileptic manifestations may occur in the\r\nform of equivalents during the development of the growth. Bernhardt and\r\nOppenheim have called attention to episodes of vertigo, irritability,\r\nexcitement, clouding and occasional delirium with amnesia following\r\nintense paroxysms of headache. These attacks also strongly suggest\r\nthe characteristics of epileptic psychoses. Nothnagel, Bernhardt,\r\nOppenheim, Schuster, Ziehen and others attribute the mental symptoms\r\nassociated with brain tumor to increased intracranial pressure\r\nproducing an anaemia. Klippel, Maillard, Vigouroux, Kaplan and others\r\nbelieve that they are due to toxins originating in the growth. This\r\nview is based largely on the appearance of psychoses similar to the\r\nKorsakow syndrome. Knapp in 1906 called attention to the prominence of\r\nmental symptoms in growths occurring in the anterior portion of the\r\ncorpus callosum. These may be associated with intellectual defects,\r\napraxia, speech disturbances and stupor. Gianelli found mental\r\ndisturbances in 209 of 318 cases examined.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[195] attributes the mental symptoms of growths to an injury\r\nof the brain structure, changes in intracranial pressure, circulatory\r\ndisturbances, and the absorption of toxic substances. A growth of\r\nconsiderable size but of slow development may permit of a readjustment\r\nof pressure, etc., and show few symptoms. On the other hand, a\r\nsmall neoplasm on account of its site or rapidity of growth may be\r\naccompanied by profound mental disturbances resulting from chemical\r\nirritation, obstruction of the aqueduct of Sylvius, or circulatory\r\ninterferences. Kraepelin quotes Schuster (1902) as finding psychotic\r\nsymptoms in all cases of growths in the corpus callosum, in two-thirds\r\nof those of the hypophysis, in one-third of those of the cerebellum and\r\nin one-fourth of the cases with involvement of the brain stem. These he\r\nlooks upon as pressure symptoms except in the case of the callosal\r\nneoplasms. Schuster was of the opinion that growths in the cortex\r\nusually lead to actual psychoses and those in the deeper areas to\r\ndementia. He found a general mental deterioration in 423 out of a total\r\nof 775 cases of brain tumor. The patients were indolent, inattentive,\r\nclumsy, forgetful, dull, tired easily and lost more and more their\r\ncapacity and inclination for sustained exertion. Thought, decision and\r\nmental processes generally, required an unusual amount of effort. The\r\npatients usually became somewhat confused and disoriented in regard to\r\ntime, place and person, as well as incoherent in speech. In many cases\r\nthere is a marked memory disturbance with a tendency to fabrication\r\nsuggesting Korsakow's psychosis. Delirious states with hallucinations\r\nsometimes accompany growths in the posterior lobes. Kraepelin has also\r\nobserved hallucinations in cases with tumor of the cerebellum. Many\r\ndevelop hypochondriacal ideas, others have delusions of persecution or\r\nself-accusation and suicidal tendencies. Rarely there are delusions of\r\ngrandeur. The mood is usually anxious, depressed and at times\r\nirritable or apathetic. Occasionally the patients may, on the other\r\nhand, be cheerful in spite of the hopeless condition they are in.\r\nThey may even show distractibility, flight of ideas, volubility and\r\nexcitement. There is more often a childish elation with a tendency to\r\njoking and facetiousness. Schuster found this more common in frontal\r\ninvolvements. Kraepelin also called attention to restlessness and\r\nexcitements often leading to violence. This may alternate with mental\r\ndulness and cataleptic states. The patients may repeat words and make\r\nmeaningless response to questions, strongly suggesting katatonia.\r\nMental dulness becomes more and more marked, however, even reaching\r\na stuporous stage. To this is added, according to the location of\r\nthe growth, focal symptoms of various kinds—headache, disturbance\r\nof vision, seizures, paralyses, aphasia, agraphia, articulatory\r\ndisturbance, ataxia, etc. Special symptoms arise where psychogenic\r\nfactors play a part,—excitements with paralyses or disturbance of\r\nperception, etc. Hysterical stigmata may appear. Cases with growths in\r\nthe frontal region occasionally simulate general paresis but should be\r\ndistinguished without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Association's statistical manual has the following to say of\r\npsychoses with brain tumor:—\r\n\r\n\"A large majority of brain tumor cases show definite mental symptoms.\r\nMost frequent are mental dullness, somnolence, hebetude, slowness in\r\nthinking, memory failure, irritability and depression, although a\r\ntendency to facetiousness is sometimes observed. Episodes of confusion\r\nwith hallucinations are common; some cases express suspicions and\r\nparanoid ideas.\r\n\r\n\"The diagnosis must rest in most cases on the neurological symptoms,\r\nand these will depend on the location, size and rate of growth of\r\nthe tumor. Certain general physical symptoms due to an increased\r\nintracranial pressure are present in most cases, viz.: headache,\r\ndizziness, vomiting, slowing of the pulse, choked disc and interlacing\r\nof the color fields.\"\r\n\r\nThe number of cases reaching hospitals for mental diseases is, of\r\ncourse, small. In 49,640 first admissions to the New York state\r\nhospitals in eight years there were sixty-seven cases (.14 per cent)\r\nof psychoses with brain tumor. In 18,336 admissions to twenty-one\r\nhospitals in fourteen other states there were eighteen cases (.09 per\r\ncent) diagnosed as psychoses with brain tumor. There were ninety-three\r\ncases (.13 per cent) in 70,987 first admissions to forty-eight\r\nhospitals for mental diseases in sixteen different states.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psychoses with Other Brain or Nervous Diseases_\r\n\r\nCerebral hemorrhages, thrombosis and embolism are more or less\r\nintimately associated etiologically, pathologically and clinically.\r\nThey all bear a rather definite relation to the general question of\r\narteriosclerosis and may all lead to cerebral softening. Apoplexy is\r\na term which was employed by Aristophanes, Demosthenes and Sophocles\r\nand has been in general use for centuries. It was known to Chaucer and\r\nwas referred to in Shakespeare's works (\"Henry IV\"). It was studied\r\nvery elaborately by Sydenham and many other early writers. Charcot and\r\nBouchard in 1864 called attention to the relation existing between\r\nmiliary aneurysms of the cerebral vessels and hemorrhages. In a study\r\nof the cerebral vascular lesions at the University College Hospital,\r\nLondon, Jones (_Brain_, 1905) found records of one hundred and sixty\r\ncases occurring during a period of sixty-five years. Of these, 123\r\nshowed hemorrhages; twenty-four, thrombosis; and thirteen were due to\r\nembolism.\r\n\r\nThomas[196] states that: \"The symptoms following acute vascular lesions\r\nof the brain, whether the process be the rupture of a vessel or its\r\nocclusion, are in many respects identical; and clinically it is often\r\nimpossible to determine which process has been effective.\" He calls\r\nattention to the fact that in thrombosis the final closure of a vessel\r\nmay occur suddenly and the symptoms develop with great rapidity. On\r\nthe other hand, the rupture of a vessel may mean the escape of only a\r\nsmall quantity of blood and after an embolism the circulation is not\r\nalways stopped immediately. In an analysis of 401 apoplectic attacks\r\nThomas found no loss of consciousness in 202 cases, although it was\r\ninterrupted or markedly disturbed in 199. Jones found a complete loss\r\nof consciousness in 47.7 per cent of 201 cases of cerebral embolism\r\nand a partial disturbance in sixty per cent. He reported consciousness\r\naffected in seventy-five per cent of his cases of cerebral hemorrhage\r\nand in 45.5 per cent of those of thrombosis. When it occurs it is\r\nusually not the initial symptom in his experience, being preceded by\r\nheadache, vertigo, weakness in certain parts of the body, etc. An\r\nanalysis of the cases of embolism reported by Virchow, however, showed\r\na sudden loss of consciousness as the initial symptom to be the general\r\nrule. Gowers is of the opinion that an initial softening is a more\r\ncommon occurrence than hemorrhage.\r\n\r\nIn the young, apoplectic attacks are usually due to cerebral softening,\r\nthrombosis following acute disease or embolism resulting from\r\nendocarditis. Between the ages of twenty and forty apoplexies usually\r\nmean syphilitic thrombosis. In the later decades of life, either\r\nhemorrhage, thrombosis, embolism or softening may occur. Thomas[197]\r\ncollected from various hospitals, statistics of 840 cases. Of these,\r\n499 showed hemorrhages and 341 softenings. He is of the opinion that\r\nthe presence of premonitory symptoms for some days indicate thrombosis,\r\nwhile shorter prodromal periods point to a hemorrhage. Rapidly\r\ndeveloping coma suggests hemorrhage, while a widespread paralysis\r\nwithout much disturbance of consciousness is more common in thrombosis.\r\nA marked fall of temperature and rise of blood pressure as a rule\r\nmeans a hemorrhage. Repeated convulsions are more often associated\r\nwith softening or embolism. If the symptoms indicate a capsular lesion\r\nit favors hemorrhage, and if of a cortical type, softenings are\r\nmore likely. A positive Wassermann reaction suggests thrombosis or\r\nsoftening. The presence of endocarditis with heart murmurs points to\r\nembolism. Thomas finds that, while the patient may recover from either\r\nof these conditions without apparent intellectual defect, he is liable\r\nto be petulant, emotional, depressed and tire easily.\r\n\r\nIn psychoses following hemorrhage, thrombosis and embolism\r\nKraepelin[198] as a rule finds very little relation between the nature\r\nof the lesion in question and the symptoms to be expected. Immediately\r\nfollowing the seizure the patients become dull, clouded, confused\r\nand disoriented, and peculiar in their behavior. This is followed by\r\nan active excitement with loud cries, resistiveness and struggling.\r\nThese acute disturbances usually subside, leaving, however, evidences\r\nof the arteriosclerosis or syphilitic endarteritis which caused the\r\nhemorrhage or thrombosis. Embolism may leave an apparently permanent\r\nmental deterioration with aphasic and paraphasic manifestations which\r\noften entirely clear up. In lesions of younger persons due to syphilis,\r\nmental enfeeblement may follow.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the psychoses accompanying paralysis agitans is very\r\ninadequate. The disease was first fully described by Parkinson in an\r\nEnglish publication in 1817, although, according to Camp, similar\r\ncases were reported by Schwarz in 1766. The etiology of this condition\r\nis unknown and the pathology is not at all definite. It seems to be\r\nthe rather general opinion of neurologists that mental disturbances\r\nare quite rare in Parkinson's Disease. Camp,[199] for instance, has\r\nthe following to say on this subject:—\"Mental conditions have also\r\nbeen described, but usually the patient's mind is entirely clear. In\r\nthe very old the changes incident to senility, such as irritability,\r\nchildishness, etc., insomnia and memory changes, might be expected and\r\nmay require special treatment. Often these patients are emotionally\r\nunstable and spells of forced weeping or laughter occur.\" Krafft-Ebing\r\nrefers to mental weakness in paralysis agitans and speaks of the\r\nfrequency of melancholia with hallucinations and suicidal impulses\r\noccurring intermittently and appearing with exacerbations of the\r\ndisease. He speaks of premature senility as playing the most important\r\netiological rôle. McCarthy[200] expresses the opinion that: \"Beyond\r\na tendency on the part of some patients to adopt a whining and\r\ncomplaining manner, the mind remains very clear; in fact, the good\r\nnature and complaisance of most of the patients, in spite of the\r\nseverity of the symptoms, is a matter of common observation. Dementia\r\nmay, however, complicate a case of the disease.\" On the other hand,\r\nParant, a French writer who made an elaborate study of this subject in\r\n1883, described three distinct varieties of mental disturbance observed\r\nby him. In the milder cases he found changes in the personality.\r\nThis is shown by irritability, egotism, restlessness, suspicion,\r\nundue sensitiveness regarding their disease, mild persecutory ideas,\r\ntendencies to depression, indifference and apathy. The second class\r\nof cases described included mental deterioration with difficulty\r\nof thought, loss of memory, etc. The third group includes definite\r\npsychoses characterized generally by depressions with or without\r\nhallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations of sight are said to be\r\ncommon. Delusions of persecution are prominent and hypochondriacal\r\nand somatic ideas frequently occur. Suicidal tendencies are very\r\npronounced. According to Ball, these episodes come and go \"with the\r\naggravation of the sensory symptoms, and they seem to disappear when\r\nthe tremor decreases or ceases entirely.\" The usual tendency in these\r\ncases, as shown by Parant, is to terminate in complete deterioration.\r\n\r\nOf the inflammatory conditions of the meninges Kraepelin[201] makes\r\nspecial reference to mental disturbances associated with tuberculosis.\r\nThe patient is depressed, anxious, irritable and apathetic, often with\r\nthe first appearance of the disease. Dulness and memory disturbances\r\nbecome more and more apparent. The patient soon becomes clouded and\r\ndisoriented, confused and delirious. Occasionally hallucinations\r\nappear. The disturbance of consciousness becomes more and more marked.\r\nThe patient becomes incoherent, restless, noisy and often violent.\r\nThe excitement may reach the stage of an actual mania with delirious\r\nconfusion. Sometimes the symptoms are strongly suggestive of katatonia.\r\nIn alcoholics a condition very similar to delirium tremens develops,\r\nterminating as a rule in stupor and coma. Speech disturbance, aphasia,\r\nconvulsions, hyperesthesia or muscular weakness may be observed in\r\nsuch cases. Other forms of meningitis are quite similar but more rapid\r\nin development and of shorter duration. In some instances, as after\r\nepidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, states of mental enfeeblement may\r\nfollow the disease.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that our information on the subject of multiple\r\nsclerosis is far from being complete. In a discussion of the mental\r\nsymptoms accompanying this condition, Henderson[202] expressed the\r\nfollowing views:—\"Cases of disseminated sclerosis which present\r\ndefinite, well marked psychoses are extremely rare. When mental\r\nsymptoms do occur, they usually come on when the condition is well\r\nadvanced, the most common symptoms are mild euphoria, labile mood,\r\napathy and dullness, and a slightly defective memory. In some\r\ncases, however, depression has been described as the outstanding\r\nfeature, while hallucinations of sight and hearing are not uncommon\r\naccompaniments. In certain cases the mental symptoms may come on\r\nearly, and these are usually of excessive severity and are rapidly\r\nfollowed by complete dementia.\" Dunlap has described cases associated\r\nwith general paresis and showing the characteristic lesions of both\r\ndiseases at autopsy. According to Kraepelin[203] mental disturbances\r\nsometimes appear before physical symptoms are observed. These take the\r\nform of depression, anxiety, fear, with occasional deliria, hysterical\r\nmanifestations, emotional dulness, variable moods and a marked\r\nirritability. Later in the disease more marked euphoric or depressive\r\ntendencies appear, with excitements and confusional states. Delusions\r\nof a persecutory nature, or ideas of grandeur may be observed.\r\nHallucinations are infrequent. According to Kraepelin, from ten to\r\nthirty per cent of the cases terminate in a general mental enfeeblement\r\nwhich is not usually of an advanced degree. He also describes a lobar\r\ncortical sclerosis with much more marked mental disturbances suggesting\r\ndementia praecox.\r\n\r\nVarious mental conditions have been attributed to tabes. Sachs[204]\r\nspeaks of depressions and neurasthenic conditions with irritability as\r\na special symptom. He has observed paranoid states and manic attacks,\r\nsometimes with periods of \"transitory dementia\" with or without\r\naphasia. He also expresses the opinion that tabetics may develop\r\nall of the symptoms of general paresis, although he says that the\r\ncoexistence of the two diseases is rare. Kraepelin[205] speaks of\r\nmilder forms of psychoses characterized by uncertainty of memory,\r\nfatigability and emotional instability. Many cases exhibit a hopeless,\r\ngloomy attitude with depression and fears, or they may be surly,\r\nirritable and quarrelsome. Others show a surprisingly good humor.\r\nThe emotional disturbances often suggest general paresis. Kraepelin,\r\nhowever, describes the characteristic psychosis of locomotor ataxia\r\nas assuming a paranoid form and quotes Meyer as reporting paranoic\r\nconditions in twenty-six tabetics and depressions of various types\r\nin fourteen. He also speaks of hallucinatory excitements resembling\r\nalcoholic conditions. These are characterized by a sudden anxiety\r\nand restlessness with hallucinations of both hearing and vision. The\r\npatients complain of poisoning and sensations of electricity, but\r\nare cheerful in mood and well oriented. This condition may last for\r\nweeks or months, ending in a sudden recovery, often with relapses.\r\nShorter hallucinatory delirious states resembling crises are also\r\nreferred to by Kraepelin. More chronic conditions are noted, with\r\nhallucinations, persecutory delusions and ideas of grandeur. Delirium\r\ntremens, manic-depressive attacks, katatonia or senile psychoses may be\r\nassociated with tabes.\r\n\r\nThe literature of medicine contains many references to acute chorea. It\r\nwas referred to, according to Paton, by Plat as early as 1614 and was\r\ndiscussed by Sydenham at some length. Wharton Sinkler, in describing\r\nchorea in Pepper's \"System of Medicine\" in 1886, made the following\r\ninteresting remarks on the mental changes involved:—\"The child is\r\nirritable and feverish, cries and laughs readily, or is sullen and\r\nmorose. Sometimes he is violent to those about him but this is rare.\r\nIntellectually the patient suffers somewhat. He is not able to study\r\nas before, and the memory may be impaired. Sometimes there is a mild\r\nform of dementia.\" Burr[206] divides these conditions into four\r\ngroups:—\"First (and this includes the vast majority), patients in\r\nwhom there is peevishness, fretfulness, some loss of the power of\r\nfixing the attention, and a slight loss of the moral sense shown by\r\ndisobedience and selfishness. Second, those showing in addition to\r\nthe above symptoms, night terrors, and transitory, visual, auditory,\r\nor other hallucinations. Third, those with distinct delirium, wild\r\nor mild, accompanied with fever. Fourth (and this group is very\r\nsmall when we remember how common chorea is), those showing stupor,\r\nor rather stupidity, and an acute dementia, which may follow the\r\ncondition described under three, or appear without any preceding\r\nmental symptoms at all severe, and which is usually accompanied with\r\ntrouble on articulation not caused by choreic movements of the lips\r\nand tongue, but the result of mental hebetude.\" White[207] refers to\r\nthe irritability and emotional instability of choreics and describes a\r\npsychosis in \"chorea insaniens\" characterized by an acute confusion,\r\nsometimes of a violent type with hallucinations, or a paranoic\r\ncondition with delusions of persecution. This may develop into a\r\nstuporous state. Kraepelin describes the psychotic manifestations of\r\nacute chorea as forms of delirium due to infection with characteristic\r\nstates of clouding, confusion, etc. Wechsler has expressed similar\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nEncephalitis lethargica is a disease which has received a great deal\r\nof attention during the last few years. The term was first applied\r\nby von Economo[208] to a series of cases observed by him in Vienna\r\nin 1917, although, as he has pointed out, similar epidemics occurred\r\nas early as in 1712. This condition is characterized particularly by\r\nlethargy, facial and oculomotor paralyses and a rise of temperature.\r\nCases were reported from England and France by various observers\r\nin 1918 and by Pothier, Neal and others in this country in 1919.\r\nIt has been suggested frequently that the disease is in some way\r\nassociated with influenza. The pathological findings have also been\r\nconfused with the African sleeping sickness due to trypanosomes.\r\nAfter such prodromal symptoms as headache, malaise and drowsiness\r\nwith muscular weakness for a few days, a lethargic or stuporous state\r\nusually develops, interrupted occasionally by delirious attacks.\r\nPtosis has been reported, sometimes with immobility of the pupils.\r\nParalyses of the facial and eye muscles are very common. Buzzard and\r\nGreenfield[209] after a review of twenty-two cases suggested the\r\nfollowing symptomatological classification:—1. Cases characterized by\r\nhemiplegia, hemianesthesia, hemianopsia, etc.; 2. Cases characterized\r\nby symptoms resembling those of paralysis agitans:—the basal ganglia\r\ngroup; and 3. Cases characterized by a disturbance of the cranial\r\nnerve functions. In a publication issued recently by the United States\r\nPublic Health Service the various types of the disease were summarized\r\nas follows:—1. A clinical affection of the third pair of nerves;\r\n2. Affections of the brain stem and bulb; 3. Affections of the long\r\ntracts; 4. The ataxic type; 5. Affections of the cerebral cortex; 6.\r\nCases with evidence of spinal cord involvement; and 7. The polyneuritic\r\ntype with involvement of the peripheral nerves. The Massachusetts\r\nDepartment of Public Health has recently recommended the use of the\r\nMacNulty classification, which is quite similar in some respects:—\r\n\r\n 1. Symptoms of a general nature referable to the central nervous system\r\n    with no localizing signs.\r\n\r\n 2. General symptoms with third nerve paralysis.\r\n\r\n 3. General symptoms with localizing signs of facial paralysis.\r\n\r\n 4. General symptoms with localizing signs extending down to the cord.\r\n\r\n 5. General symptoms with polyneuritic involvements.\r\n\r\n 6. Mild and abortive cases.\r\n\r\nAutopsies have shown meningeal and cortical congestion, degeneration\r\nof the nerve cells, and thickening of the vessels with endothelial\r\nproliferation of the glia. Venous thrombosis and multiple hemorrhages\r\nalso occur. In a study of the cerebrospinal fluid Boveri[210] found the\r\npressure slightly greater in many cases with an increase in the albumen\r\nand globulin content and a mild lymphocytosis in occasional cases. The\r\nfindings are not characteristic or of great diagnostic value. Efforts\r\nto isolate the organism responsible for this disease have so far been\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe mental symptoms associated with encephalitis lethargica have been\r\nstudied recently by Abrahamson[211]. He finds that the patient can be\r\naroused from the initial lethargy and responds quickly and coherently\r\nto questions, relapsing again into an apparent sleep. Some irritability\r\nis shown. The attitude \"expresses a desire to be left alone.\" If the\r\nsomnolence disappears it is usually followed by a period of depression.\r\nThe patient complains of weariness and inability to sleep. Choreic\r\nmanifestations sometimes occur. The somnolence may terminate, on the\r\nother hand, in a profound stupor resembling a drug intoxication with\r\na restless delirium. Even then the patient can be roused momentarily.\r\nResponses are automatic with no evidences of emotional disturbance.\r\nFlexibilitas cerea is often present. This condition may be followed by\r\na period of confusion, disorientation and amnesia suggesting Korsakow's\r\ndisease. There is usually a period of mental depression with poverty of\r\nthought. Occasional hallucinations were also observed.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly important contribution to the literature of encephalitis\r\nlethargica is an analysis recently made of the symptoms shown in\r\neighteen cases by Kirby and Davis.[212] \"The psychic disturbances of\r\nepidemic encephalitis present the general characteristics of an acute\r\norganic type of mental reaction, corresponding more specifically to\r\na toxic-infectious psychosis. In the acute stages of the disease,\r\npsychic torpor and delirium are the most frequently observed mental\r\ndisturbances although other clinical pictures may be encountered,\r\nas the Korsakoff syndrome or more complex mental disorders in which\r\nvarious affective and trend reactions give a special cast to the\r\npsychotic disturbance.\" They report two types of sleep disturbance,\r\nhypersomnia and hyposomnia. The former is characterized by drowsiness,\r\nlethargy, stupor or coma, depending entirely on the degree reached. In\r\nthe latter the patient is sleepless at night and somnolent during the\r\ndaytime. Usually delirium was present at some time in both types of\r\nthe disease. Often there was a brief period showing a mild depression\r\nor anxiety, following lethargy or delirium. Euphoria was observed\r\nin a number of instances. In the unrecovered cases they often found\r\nresiduals—\"depressive affects, emotional elevations, irritability,\r\nexplosive reactions, stubbornness, apathy, etc.\" Their findings may be\r\nsummarized perhaps in the statement that \"definitely formulated and\r\npersistent trends are infrequent in epidemic encephalitis ... we have\r\nfound much evidence of persisting emotional alteration with little\r\nevidence of organic mental defects or dementia.\"\r\n\r\nA review of the statistics of American institutions shows that\r\npsychoses associated with brain and nervous diseases other than\r\nHuntington's chorea and brain tumor, which have already been discussed,\r\nare exceedingly rare. The percentage of cases reported in the New\r\nYork hospitals was .95, in the Massachusetts institutions, 1.02, and\r\nin twenty-one other hospitals only 1.56. In a total of 70,987 first\r\nadmissions there were only 787 cases (1.1 per cent). The relative\r\nfrequency of the various forms is illustrated by the statistics of the\r\nadmissions to the New York state hospitals during a period of eight\r\nyears. Of 462 cases, 160 were diagnosed as psychoses due to cerebral\r\nembolism; twelve, to meningitis; twenty, to multiple sclerosis;\r\nthirty-eight, to tabes; thirty-four, to acute chorea; and 163, to\r\nother conditions not specified. These figures are astonishing when the\r\nfact that 49,640 patients were admitted during that time is taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ALCOHOLIC PSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Tuke,[213] one of the oldest of the Egyptian papyri in the\r\nBritish Museum (Papyrus Sallier I) makes the following very interesting\r\nreference to alcoholism:— \"Whereas it has been told me that thou hast\r\nforsaken books, and devoted thyself to pleasure; that thou goest from\r\ntavern to tavern, smelling of beer, at the time of evening. If beer\r\ngets into a man it overcomes his mind.... Thou knowest that wine is an\r\nabomination, that thou hast taken an oath that thou wouldst not put\r\nliquor into thee. Hast thou forgotten thy resolution?\" It is difficult\r\nto realize that this refers to one of the earliest periods of recorded\r\nhistory. Hebrew, Greek and Roman literature are prolific in equally\r\nsignificant testimonials to the antiquity of alcohol as an intoxicant.\r\nIt was referred to at considerable length by Aristotle, Plutarch and\r\nHippocrates. That Haslam appreciated the important relation existing\r\nbetween alcoholism and mental disorders is shown by the following\r\ncomment on this subject written in 1808:—\"Thus a man is permitted\r\nslowly to poison and destroy himself; to produce a state of irritation,\r\nwhich disqualifies him from any of the useful purposes of life; to\r\nsquander his property among the most worthless and abandoned; to\r\ncommunicate a loathsome and disgraceful disease to a virtuous wife; to\r\nleave an innocent and helpless family to the meagre protection of the\r\nparish. If it be possible the law ought to define the circumstances\r\nunder which it becomes justifiable to restrain a human being from\r\neffecting his own destruction, and involving his family in misery and\r\nruin. When a man suddenly bursts through the barriers of established\r\nopinion; if he attempts to strangle himself with a cord, to divide his\r\nlarge blood vessels with a knife, or swallow a vial full of laudanum,\r\nno one entertains any doubt about his being a proper subject for the\r\nsuperintendence of keepers; but he is allowed, without control, by a\r\ngradual process, to undermine the fabric of his health and destroy the\r\nproperty of his family.\"\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the word alcohol is of Arabic origin and was employed\r\noriginally to describe a powder used in applications to the eyebrows\r\nfor cosmetic purposes. It was subsequently used for centuries as\r\nreferring to a fine powder of any kind, as is shown by the writings\r\nof Paracelsus and others. The chemical composition of alcohol was not\r\nknown until 1808, when it was described by Lavoisier. On the other\r\nhand, Salvatori in 1817 and Hufeland in 1818 referred to dipsomania\r\nas a disorder due to alcoholism. Esquirol, Trélat and other early\r\nwriters included it in the \"partial\" insanities. Morel described it\r\nas an impulsive form of \"délire émotif\" and looked upon it as an\r\nhereditary condition. It has been classified with the periodical\r\ninsanities and even as a form of melancholia. Magnan saw in it an\r\nepisode of the insanity of degeneracy. Magnus Huss was responsible for\r\nthe introduction of the term \"chronic alcoholism\" as descriptive of a\r\npathological condition in 1852.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Caelius Aurelianus protested against the use of\r\nintoxicants in the treatment of the insane. Notwithstanding this early\r\nreference to a question of such importance, and the inauguration of\r\nthe great temperance crusade which began in 1808, it has been shown\r\nby Tuke[214] that alcoholic beverages were issued in a routine way to\r\npatients and employees of the British asylums for the insane less than\r\nforty years ago. \"Thirty superintendents hold that they have observed\r\nvery beneficial results from the course pursued. The improvement\r\nusually refers not only to the patients, but to the discipline of the\r\nasylum.\" The cost of beer supplied to the inmates at the Glamorgan\r\nAsylum at one time was reported to be as high as two hundred and sixty\r\npounds per year (Tuke). Beer was not discontinued as a regular article\r\nof diet for patients at the Derby Asylum until 1884.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 Flemming[215] in his classification of psychoses mentioned\r\nthe following forms of alcoholic insanity:— Ferocitas et morositas\r\nebriosorum, anoësia e potu, anoësia semisomnis, delirium tremens, and\r\nmania à potu. Clouston[216] described acute and chronic forms—mania à\r\npotu, dipsomania, alcoholic dementia and degeneration. Krafft-Ebing[217]\r\nspeaks of hallucinations of the inebriate, delirium tremens, alcoholic\r\nmelancholia, mania gravis potatorum, hallucinatory insanity, alcoholic\r\nparanoia, alcoholic paralysis and epilepsy. Delirium tremens he\r\nascribes either to repeated excesses (à potu nimio), abstinence (à potu\r\nintermisso), insufficient nourishment, violent emotions, pneumonia and\r\nother acute diseases, loss of sleep, injuries such as fractures, etc.\r\nBy hallucination of the inebriate (sensuum fallacia ebriosa) he refers\r\nto the transitory hallucinations of the constant drinker. Meyer[218]\r\nhas described an alcoholic constitution \"as shown by the lachrymose,\r\nprevaricating, jealous deterioration of the drinker.\"\r\n\r\nStöcker,[219] after an extended study of a considerable number of\r\ncases, came to the conclusion that alcoholism is the result of a\r\nconstitutional condition but not the cause of characteristic psychoses.\r\nOften, as was also shown by Bonhöffer, it is to be attributed to\r\na psychopathic personality either acquired or congenital. The\r\npsychoses represented by the group of patients he examined included\r\nmanic-depressive insanity, dementia praecox, hysteria, epilepsy and\r\nother miscellaneous conditions. He refers to dipsomania as an epileptic\r\nequivalent. His conclusions in brief were as follows:—\"Chronic\r\nalcoholism in the first place is a symptom of a mental disease. It may,\r\nhowever, so exaggerate stationary epilepsy, chronic mania, dementia\r\npraecox, etc., which hitherto were latent, and perhaps would remain\r\nstill latent without alcoholic abuses, that it may lead to a sudden\r\noutbreak of a turbulent disease manifestation. It may also give these\r\ndiseases peculiar traits or a peculiar coloring for some time, which\r\nabove all, may appear as the most striking phenomena, and thus cover up\r\nthe symptoms of the fundamental disorder. Furthermore, it may, also,\r\non the basis of this constitutional disease give rise to independent\r\nclinical pictures.\" Karpas[220] in commenting on this says: \"One must\r\nremember that cravings play important rôles in our mental life. Some\r\nof our cravings are gratified; others find realization in our dreams;\r\nstill others are repressed and compensated. In fact, our mental\r\nlife is nothing but a readjustment, of complex reactions. The poet\r\nfinds recourse in his phantasies; the philosopher gives vent to his\r\ntheoretical speculations; the scientist resorts to his inventions and\r\nhypothetical theories; the well balanced, normal individual seeks\r\nreadjustment in healthy activities,—art, literature, science,\r\noccupations, sport, etc., etc. But the individual with a poorly endowed\r\nconstitution finds refuge in neurosis, psychosis, alcoholism, drugs,\r\nand other vicious habits. We must recognize that alcoholism is nothing\r\nbut a compensation for a complex, the fulfillment of which was denied\r\nby reality.\"\r\n\r\nKraepelin[221] described acute and chronic alcoholism, pathological\r\nintoxication, alcoholic jealousy, delirium tremens, Korsakow's\r\npsychosis, alcoholic hallucinoses, paralysis and pseudo-paresis. In\r\nacute intoxication Kraepelin finds an inhibition of apprehension,\r\nmental grasp and the elaboration of outer impressions with a\r\nstimulation of the release of volitional impulses. A clouding of\r\nconsciousness develops, associated with emotional excitement and a\r\nweakness of will power. Perception and mental reactions are delayed\r\nand their accuracy decreased on mental tests. The discrimination\r\nbetween louder sounds is uncertain, although the sensitiveness to\r\nlighter sound impressions is increased as in the ether narcosis.\r\nBusch found a limitation of the field of vision. The preservation of\r\nmemory impressions is imperfect. A solution of mathematical problems\r\nshows a lowered mental capacity for work. The association of ideas\r\nand composition of sentences is delayed. There is a tendency to\r\nnew word formation, phrasing and rhyming, with a certain amount of\r\ndistractibility. Goal ideas are often missed, and consistent, orderly\r\nthought is not possible. Expression is rapid and impulsive, and is\r\noften characterized by a loud tone of voice.\r\n\r\nAfter larger amounts of alcohol psychomotor activities are interfered\r\nwith as shown by the writing, and ataxia appears. The reflexes show an\r\nincreased muscular tension. Physical strength is markedly lowered,\r\nalthough it may be increased for a very short time. Alcohol even in\r\nsmall amounts interferes with productive mental processes. Ideas lose\r\nin clearness and sharpness, fatigue occurs earlier and efficiency and\r\njudgment are impaired. Still larger amounts retard apprehension and\r\ncomprehension and the intoxicated person no longer knows what is said\r\nto him. All ability to control his conduct is lost. There is a tendency\r\nto repetition in speech, rhyming and jargon. Capacity for mental work\r\nis finally entirely gone and memory becomes confused. Psychomotor\r\nstimulation and excitement appear early, terminating finally in\r\nweakness. Emotional trends, at first happy and cheerful, are usually\r\nirritable, later with outbursts of anger. Sexual excitement often\r\nappears. Various physical disturbances have been described.\r\n\r\nIn the pathological or complicated intoxications as described\r\nby Kraepelin, unusual emotional disturbances such as violent\r\nexcitements occur. Anger or anxiety may develop with a clouding of\r\nthe consciousness, and lead to uncontrollable rages with impulses to\r\nassault and kill. The most marked excitements occur in epileptics.\r\nThe outburst is usually sudden in these cases and is followed by the\r\nmost senseless and unjustifiable acts. Occasionally suicide is the\r\nresult. In hysterical and psychopathic individuals alcohol may cause\r\nserious emotional disturbances, with clouding of consciousness or even\r\ndelusion formation. Chronic drinkers are very likely to have abnormal\r\nsymptoms at times. They often show a marked irritability followed\r\nby a pathetic and tearful mood. Abusive treatment of members of the\r\nfamily, jealousy, threats and violence are not uncommon. Delirious or\r\nanxious states with persecutory ideas and hallucinations are sometimes\r\nobserved. These may exist only during intoxication. Alcohol often\r\nproduces extreme excitements in cases of manic-depressive insanity,\r\ngeneral paresis and dementia praecox. Pathological changes of various\r\nkinds have been reported. In acute alcoholism Nissl found a destruction\r\nof cortical cells in some cases and a disappearance of the stainable\r\nlumps in others. The nuclei of the neurones were shrunken and sometimes\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\nVarious tests have demonstrated the limited mental capacity of the\r\nchronic alcoholic. Will power is greatly reduced and fatigability\r\nincreased. Memory and attention are affected and falsification of\r\nthe past may occur. The patient learns nothing new and forgets the\r\nimportant things. All productive efficiency is gone and interest is\r\nlost. Weakness of judgment and loss of memory capacity lead to delusion\r\nformation. These often take the form of ideas of jealousy. Delusions\r\nof persecution, poisoning or grandeur may appear from time to time.\r\nFrequently there are genuine hallucinations. Some cases terminate\r\nfinally in mental enfeeblement. Emotional changes are common in the\r\nchronic drinkers. The alcoholic humor is characteristic. The capacity\r\nfor taking things seriously has been lost and there is a tendency to\r\nundue levity, often with a marked feeling of self-satisfaction. Some\r\nindividuals, however, become moody, irritable or dull. Occasionally\r\nanxious states appear, frequently with suicidal attempts. One of the\r\ncommon symptoms of this condition is an extraordinary irritability\r\nafter drinking. This leads to quarrels, assaults and violence.\r\nConsideration for others is completely lost. These attacks are often\r\nfollowed by remorse. A prominent and significant feature of the\r\ndisease is the marked moral deterioration. All affection for family\r\nand children may be lost. Selfishness is pronounced and the patient\r\nspends all of his money for drink. Sexual excitement is sometimes\r\nan important symptom. With all of this there is a constant craving\r\nfor alcohol. The patients have no insight into their condition and\r\nattribute their headache and tremors to overexertion, etc. They always\r\ndeny using much alcohol and are absolutely untruthful on this subject.\r\nOverwork necessitates drinking, or it only happens after a death in the\r\nfamily, etc. Will power deteriorates rapidly. These individuals often\r\ncommit crimes and come into conflict with the law. Gastritis, cirrhosis\r\nof the liver and numerous other diseases complicate the situation.\r\nDizzy spells and headaches are common, as well as tremors of the\r\ntongue and fingers. Neurotic involvements are noted, with anesthesias,\r\nhyperesthesias, paresthesias, and muscular atrophies as well as speech\r\ndefects. Epileptiform attacks are not infrequent in chronic alcoholism,\r\nand were found in ten per cent of Kraepelin's cases. His investigations\r\nshowed that eleven per cent of the beer drinkers in Munich had\r\nconvulsions. Combinations of epilepsy and hysterical manifestations\r\nwith chronic alcoholism are not at all unusual. Rybakoff found a\r\nhereditary taint in 66.6 per cent of his cases while Moli reported only\r\nforty-seven per cent. Heredity was found to be a factor in thirty-seven\r\nper cent of Kraepelin's Heidelberg cases and in seventeen per cent\r\nof those at Munich. He describes various pathological findings in\r\nchronic alcoholism. Meningitis with hemorrhagic membranes is common.\r\nThe convolutions are atrophied and the ependyma of the ventricles\r\nthickened. Pigmentary deposits similar to those of senility are found\r\nin the cells and vessel walls. There is an increase of both neuroglia\r\ncells and fibres. Hemorrhages are occasionally found in the central\r\ngray matter.\r\n\r\nWhen the suspicions of the chronic alcoholic lead to well defined\r\ndelusions Kraepelin speaks of \"alcoholic jealousy\" as constituting a\r\ndistinct psychosis. The patient sees in almost everything evidences of\r\ninfidelity on the part of his wife and is often inclined to question\r\nthe legitimacy of his own children. Assaults and violence are frequent\r\noccurrences. Occasionally genuine hallucinations accompany this\r\ncondition. Suicidal and homicidal attempts are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe onset of delirium tremens, first described by Thomas Sutton in\r\n1813, is characterized by states of anxiety, fear, insomnia with\r\ndisturbing dreams, sensory excitement, hyperesthesias, flashes\r\nof light, etc. The development usually is sudden, with a loss of\r\nattention, disturbance of apprehension, restlessness, distractibility,\r\nnumerous hallucinations of the different senses, illusions, clouded\r\nstates with disorientation, tremors and ataxia. Touch, pain and\r\ntemperature sensations, according to Kraepelin, are undisturbed.\r\nThe field of vision is sometimes narrowed. Recognition of colors is\r\nuncertain. There is a marked disturbance of the equilibrium, suggesting\r\nsome lesion either of the eye muscles or of the labyrinth. A decided\r\nlengthening of the reaction time in associations has been shown by\r\nvarious observers. Sensory hallucinations are common. The ability\r\nto read correctly is entirely lost and what is read is meaningless.\r\nA paraphasic form of reading has been described by Bonhöffer. The\r\nattention cannot be held for any length of time. A dreamy clouded state\r\nis characteristic. Disorientation is usually complete in the severe\r\ncases. The hallucinations and illusions are very marked and sometimes\r\neven suggest moving pictures to the patient. Hallucinations of vision\r\nare more common than those of hearing. Peculiar skin sensations such as\r\nfeelings of electricity are spoken of. Hallucinations may be induced\r\nby pressure on the eyeball and sometimes by suggestion. There is\r\noccasionally a confusional form of speech suggesting dementia praecox,\r\nwith a tendency to coin new words and employ entirely meaningless\r\nterms. Although consciousness is not always entirely clouded, events\r\ntranspire as in a dream, always confused by innumerable hallucinations.\r\nAn occupation delirium is common, the patient imagining himself busy\r\nat his customary work. Delusional ideas regarding everything in his\r\nsurroundings are frequent. Ideas of grandeur sometimes occur. Never,\r\naccording to Bonhöffer, is there a complete disorientation as far as\r\npersonality is concerned. The patient always knows who and what he is.\r\nComplete mental confusion is not the rule. Distractibility is usually\r\nvery well developed. Bonhöffer found an inability to supply omitted\r\nwords and syllables from well known phrases and memory for test words\r\nand numbers was impaired. Articles read are repeated with many changes\r\nand omissions. Memory for remote events is usually well preserved.\r\nSometimes there is a falsification of the past. The mood is anxious,\r\nfearful, seldom irritable, at times actually humorous. Cheerfulness and\r\nfear of death occasionally alternate.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is characterized by great restlessness often\r\nwith a tendency to talkativeness. There is, however, no flight of ideas\r\nor rhyming. Delusions of persecution occur in some cases. Anesthesias,\r\nhyperesthesias, paresthesias, hypalgesias and sensitiveness of nerves\r\nand muscles are noted. Romberg's sign is present in some instances.\r\nSpeech is often ataxic and paraphasic, and in advanced eases entirely\r\nmeaningless. Tremors of the tongue and fingers are very characteristic.\r\nWriting is very much affected as a result. Epileptiform convulsions\r\nsometimes occur. Rarely focal symptoms, facial paralysis and hemiplegia\r\nappear for a short time. Reflexes are increased and ankle clonus\r\noccasionally appears. Defective papillary reaction and unequal pupils\r\nmay be found, with diplopia and muscular weakness. Sleep is seriously\r\ninterfered with. Bodily weight is reduced and blood pressure lowered.\r\nThe temperature is usually elevated and the pulse accelerated. Albumen\r\nand sometimes sugar is present in the urine. The delirium often stops\r\nas suddenly as it begins, terminating in sleep, the patient being\r\nclear when he wakes. The memory of events is not well retained on\r\nrecovery. The delirium may, however, become chronic and last for\r\nmonths. Some cases terminate in a hallucinatory feeblemindedness.\r\nThis is likely to occur in psychopathic individuals. Hallucinations\r\nof hearing are more common in such conditions. People read their\r\nthoughts and influence their minds. They are subjected to hypnotism\r\nand electricity. The delusional ideas may be of a sexual nature or\r\ngrandiose in character. The mood may be anxious or irritable. Suicidal\r\ntendencies sometimes appear. Later a humorous trend is often noted.\r\nTremors and other neurological symptoms sometimes occur. Bonhöffer\r\nfound at autopsy a considerable fibre loss in the central convolutions,\r\nthe cerebellum and the column of Goll. In the large pyramidal and\r\nmotor cells of the anterior central convolution the processes were\r\ndeeply stained. Some nuclear changes were noted and occasional cells\r\ndestroyed. Nissl described a granular degeneration of the neurones\r\nwith a prominence of the \"unstainable\" substance, together with a\r\nswelling and crumbling of the cell bodies. Alzheimer often found free\r\nnuclei near the apical processes. In the glia cells and vessel walls\r\ngranular detritus was observed. Acute and chronic cell alterations\r\nare more common in old alcoholics. Pachymeningitis hemorrhagica is\r\nsometimes found. Kraepelin considers it very doubtful whether wine or\r\nbeer drinking ever causes delirium tremens, whisky and gin being the\r\netiological factors as a general rule.\r\n\r\nKorsakow's psychosis was first described in 1887. This is characterized\r\nby a loss of memory, and falsification, with a marked tendency\r\nto disorientation, and is often due to chronic alcoholism. It is\r\npractically always accompanied by polyneuritic symptoms. According\r\nto Bonhöffer, it usually follows delirium tremens. This occurred in\r\none-fourth of Kraepelin's cases. Occasionally it begins suddenly, but\r\nas a rule gradually, during the course of a chronic alcoholism. The\r\npatients frequently complain of dizziness, headaches and fainting\r\nspells. In the foreground of this affection is the impairment of\r\nmemory. This is one of the characteristic features. The events of a\r\nfew hours ago are completely forgotten. Disorientation appears next.\r\nThis affects time more than anything else. The power of apprehension\r\nor perception is very markedly impaired (one-sixth of the normal in\r\nKraepelin's cases) and the reaction time is greatly increased. He\r\nalso found memory reduced to one-third or one-fourth of the normal on\r\nactual tests (repetition of words and syllables). Falsification of past\r\nevents is also demonstrable. This often leads to elaborate delusion\r\nformations. The mood is usually anxious at first, later indifferent,\r\ndull, suspicious, irritable, in some eases cheerful and even humorous.\r\nThe methods of life are completely changed. The patients neglect\r\nthemselves, lie in bed, etc. The physical signs are those of neuritis.\r\nMuscular pains in the limbs appear, with evidences of loss of power.\r\nParaplegias and weakness of the grip are found. Romberg's sign is\r\nfrequently present. Anesthesias, hyperesthesias or paresthesias are\r\nnoted. The reflexes are usually decreased, rarely increased. Ataxia and\r\nother difficulties of gait are common. The pulse is usually slower as a\r\nresult of involvement of the vagus. Speech difficulty, writing defects,\r\nfacial paralyses, weakness of the eye muscles, with inequality and\r\ninactivity of the pupils, are to be expected. There are usually tremors\r\nof the fingers. Epileptiform convulsions are not infrequent. Aphasia,\r\nagraphia, apraxia, monoplegia, hemiplegic, etc., are observed in many\r\ncases. Physical disturbances of various kinds due to chronic alcoholism\r\nare also present.\r\n\r\nAt autopsy acute and grave alterations are found in the cells of the\r\nsecond and third layers of the cortex. A granular degeneration (Körnig\r\nZellerkrankung) of the cells is also referred to by Nissl. There is\r\nsome fibre loss in the central convolutions and the internal capsule,\r\nas well as in the columns of Goll. Hemorrhages and thromboses are to\r\nbe found. Alzheimer found encephalitic foci with proliferation of the\r\ncells of the vessel walls sending out fibroblasts in the neighborhood,\r\nand a destruction of the nerve fibres. These foci are found in the\r\ncentral gray matter of the third ventricle, roof of the aqueduct,\r\netc. There is a formation of new vessels and an outwandering of cells\r\noften accompanied by numerous hemorrhages into the gray matter around\r\nthe aqueduct of Sylvius. Wernieke has described this process as an\r\n\"acute hemorrhagic polioencephalitis superior\" and finds it very\r\ncommonly associated with Korsakow's psychosis. It occurs, however, in\r\nother chronic alcoholic conditions. The peripheral nerves also show a\r\npolyneuritis. Bonhöffer found Korsakow's psychosis in three per cent\r\nof his delirious cases. Thirty-three per cent of Kraepelin's cases\r\nwere women and only 24.5 per cent were under forty years of age.\r\nChotzen found Korsakow's psychosis in three per cent of his male and in\r\ntwenty-one per cent of his female alcoholics.\r\n\r\nThe acute alcoholic hallucinoses as described by Kraepelin are\r\ncharacterized by well defined delusions of persecution and above all by\r\nhallucinations of hearing, with a clear sensorium. In eighty per cent\r\nof the cases the symptoms appear suddenly. Sometimes there is first an\r\nabortive delirious attack. Usually a multiplicity of hallucinations of\r\nhearing develop early. The patient hears threats and abusive language,\r\nalways directed against himself. Visual hallucinations also occur,\r\nparticularly at night. The other sensory fields are often involved.\r\nAt the same time well marked delusions manifest themselves. These\r\nsuggest every possible variety of persecution. Ideas of grandeur\r\nare sometimes observed. All of these symptoms are worse at night\r\nas a rule. Consciousness is usually fairly clear, and there is no\r\ndisorientation. There is often a mixture of anxiety and humor. Some\r\ncases, however, are irritable and suspicious. Occasionally suicidal\r\ntendencies appear. Conduct is usually not greatly disturbed and the\r\npatient continues with his regular occupation. There is considerable\r\ninsomnia and a tendency to run around a great deal and act foolishly\r\nat times. Physically, evidences of chronic alcoholism are always to be\r\nfound. The customary duration of these acute conditions is from three\r\nto eight weeks, although they sometimes last for months. In a quarter\r\nof Kraepelin's cases the termination was in deterioration. There is a\r\nstrong tendency to recurrence. The unrecovered cases are suspicious,\r\nsurly, quarrelsome and have hallucinations of hearing. This condition\r\nmay last for years. There are always occasional persecutory ideas.\r\nOne-fifth of Kraepelin's cases became chronic. Bonhöffer described a\r\nparanoid type of long duration. The hallucinoses appear usually earlier\r\nin life than Korsakow's psychosis but later than delirium tremens. In\r\nKraepelin's experience delirium tremens is three times as common as are\r\nhallucinoses. He looks upon these two conditions, however, as different\r\nclinical manifestations of \"one and the same\" disease process.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic paralysis, so called, is a mixture of chronic alcoholic\r\nsymptoms with those of general paresis. There is a mental deterioration\r\nwith ideas of grandeur, emotional dulness, hallucinations, delusions\r\nof jealousy, speech defect, tremors and polyneuritis. Epileptiform\r\nattacks are frequent. Most of these forms according to Kraepelin\r\nbelong to Korsakow's psychosis or polioencephalitis hemorrhagica\r\nsuperior. Alcoholic conditions may also be complicated by syphilis or\r\narteriosclerosis.\r\n\r\nSince the alcoholic psychoses have been generally recognized as\r\nsuch, there has been comparatively little difference of opinion as to\r\ntheir differentiation. The classification of the American Psychiatric\r\nAssociation is as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"The diagnosis of alcoholic psychosis should be restricted to those\r\nmental disorders arising, with few exceptions, in connection with\r\n_chronic_ drinking and presenting fairly well defined symptom-pictures.\r\nOne must guard against making the alcoholic group too inclusive.\r\nOverindulgence in alcohol is often found to be merely a symptom\r\nof another psychosis, or at any rate may be incidental to another\r\npsychosis, such as general paralysis, manic-depressive insanity,\r\ndementia praecox, epilepsy, etc. The cases to be regarded as alcoholic\r\npsychoses which do not result from chronic drinking are the episodic\r\nattacks in some psychopathic personalities, the dipsomanias (the true\r\nperiodic drinkers) and pathological intoxication, any of which may\r\ndevelop as the result of a single imbibition or a relatively short\r\nspree.\r\n\r\n\"The following alcoholic reactions usually present symptoms distinctive\r\nenough to allow of clinical differentiation:\r\n\r\n\"(a) Pathological intoxication: An unusual or abnormal immediate\r\nreaction to taking a large or small amount of alcohol. Essentially an\r\nacute mental disturbance of short duration characterized usually by\r\nan excitement or furor with confusion and hallucinations, followed by\r\namnesia.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Delirium tremens: An hallucinatory delirium with marked general\r\ntremor and toxic symptoms.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Korsakow's psychosis: This occurs with or without polyneuritis.\r\nThe delirious type is not readily differentiated in the early stages\r\nfrom severe delirium tremens but is more protracted. The non-delirious\r\ntype presents a characteristic retention defect with disorientation,\r\nfabrication, suggestibility and tendency to misidentify persons.\r\nHallucinations are frequent after the acute phase.\r\n\r\n\"(d) Acute hallucinosis: This is chiefly an auditory hallucinosis of\r\nrapid development with clearness of the sensorium, marked fears, and a\r\nmore or less systematized persecutory trend.\r\n\r\n\"(e) Chronic hallucinosis: This is an infrequent type which may be\r\nregarded as the persistence of the symptoms of the acute hallucinosis\r\nwithout change in the character of the symptoms except perhaps\r\na gradual lessening of the emotional reaction accompanying the\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\n\"(f) Acute paranoid type: Suspicions, misinterpretations, and\r\npersecutory ideas, often a jealous trend, hallucinations usually\r\nsubordinate; clearing up on withdrawal of alcohol.\r\n\r\n\"(g) Chronic paranoid type: Persistence of symptoms of the acute\r\nparanoid type with fixed delusions of persecution or jealousy usually\r\nnot influenced by withdrawal of alcohol; difficult to differentiate\r\nfrom non-alcoholic paranoid states or dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n\"(h) Alcoholic deterioration: A slowly developing ethical, volitional\r\nand emotional change in the habitual drinker; apparently relatively few\r\ncases are committed, as the mental symptoms are not usually looked upon\r\nas sufficient to justify the diagnosis of a definite psychosis. The\r\nchief symptoms are ill humor and irascibility or a jovial, careless,\r\nflippant, facetious mood; abusiveness to family, unreliability and\r\ntendency to prevarication; in some cases definite suspicions and\r\njealousy; there is a general lessening of efficiency and capacity\r\nfor physical and mental work; memory not seriously impaired. To be\r\nexcluded are residual defects due to Korsakow's psychosis, or mental\r\ndeterioration due to arteriosclerosis or to traumatic lesions.\r\n\r\n\"(i) Other types, acute or chronic (to be specified).\"\r\n\r\nShadwell[222] states that in twenty-six Italian asylums 18.6 per cent\r\nof their cases were directly or indirectly the result of alcoholism.\r\nTwenty-one and one-tenth per cent of the males and 4.37 per cent of\r\nthe females admitted to the institutions of Switzerland from 1901 to\r\n1904 were alcoholics. Twenty-one and thirty-seven hundredths per cent\r\nof the admissions to the hospitals in Denmark between 1899 and 1903\r\nwere suffering from alcoholic psychoses. He gives the admission rate\r\nin Austria as fourteen per cent and in France, 12.5 per cent. Clouston\r\nsome years ago estimated the admission rate in Great Britain and\r\nIreland to be about twenty per cent.\r\n\r\nPollock[223] has made a most interesting study of 1,739 cases of\r\nalcoholic psychoses, the total number admitted to the New York state\r\nhospitals between October 1, 1909, and September 30, 1912. Seventy-six\r\nand five-tenths per cent of these were men, and 23.5 per cent, women.\r\nThe different conditions represented were as follows: Pathological\r\nintoxication, .7 per cent; alcoholic deterioration, 7.7 per cent;\r\ndelirium tremens, 4.7 per cent; Korsakow's psychosis, 18.8 per cent;\r\nacute hallucinosis, 36.7 per cent; chronic hallucinosis, 2.2 per cent;\r\nparanoid states, 13.7 per cent; and all other forms, 15.5 per cent.\r\nAmong the males, acute hallucinosis predominated, while Korsakow's\r\npsychosis constituted the largest percentage in the female patients.\r\nOf the ascertained cases, .4 per cent showed a defective make-up, 10.3\r\nper cent were inferior and 89.3 per cent were reported as normal. In\r\nseventy-four per cent of the cases there was no history of insane\r\nheredity. The father of the patient was insane in 3.7 per cent of the\r\nseries and the mother in four per cent; 25.8 per cent in all had a\r\nhistory of insane heredity. Thirty and five-tenths per cent of the\r\nmale and thirty-seven per cent of the female patients had alcoholic\r\nfathers and three per cent of the men and 8.8 per cent of the women\r\nhad alcoholic mothers. Pollock found the percentage of intemperate\r\nfathers twice as high in the alcoholic psychoses as in the patients\r\nsuffering from other conditions. In 94.1 per cent of the cases there\r\nwas no family history of nervous diseases. Eighty-one and one-tenth per\r\ncent of the men and 93.4 per cent of the women came from cities. Of the\r\nmale patients 26.8 per cent were unskilled laborers; 16.1 per cent of\r\nthe women were seamstresses, and 11.7 per cent, the wives of laborers.\r\nThe alcoholic cases constituted fifteen per cent of the male, five per\r\ncent of the female, and ten per cent of the total first rate admissions\r\nduring the three years in question. The rate of alcoholic psychoses was\r\nover twice in as great in the foreign born population as in the native.\r\n\r\nThree thousand four hundred and sixty-two cases diagnosed as alcoholic\r\npsychoses were admitted to the New York state hospitals during a\r\nperiod of eight years (1912 to 1919 inclusive). Of these, pathological\r\nintoxication constituted 2.91 per cent, delirium tremens, 5.97 per\r\ncent, Korsakow's psychosis, 20.94 per cent, acute hallucinosis, 37.31\r\nper cent, chronic hallucinosis, 3.66 per cent, acute paranoid states,\r\n5.01 per cent, chronic paranoid states, 3.78 per cent, and alcoholic\r\ndeterioration, 8.34 per cent. The remainder represented miscellaneous\r\ntypes variously described. These figures, of course, relate largely\r\nto a time when there were no restrictions on the sale of alcoholic\r\nbeverages. During 1918 and 1919 the admission rate for alcoholic\r\npsychoses in New York was only 4.58 per cent. In Massachusetts in 1919\r\nit was 7.47 per cent, and in twenty-one other hospitals in various\r\nstates it was 5.04 per cent. A study of 34,935 first admissions to\r\nforty-eight hospitals in sixteen different states during 1917, 1918 and\r\n1919 showed the alcoholic psychoses to represent 5.07 per cent of the\r\ntotal number. With the advent of prohibition the alcoholic psychoses\r\nas far as this country is concerned have become a matter of little more\r\nthan historical interest. The admission rate in the New York state\r\nhospitals for 1920 was only 1.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES DUE TO DRUGS AND OTHER EXOGENOUS TOXINS\r\n\r\n\r\nOpium is a drug which has been in quite common use for many centuries.\r\nAccording to E. M. Holmes of London, it was known to Theophrastus\r\nnearly three hundred years before the Christian era and two different\r\nforms were described by Dioscorides in the neighborhood of 77 A.D.\r\nNicander (185 to 135 B.C.) discussed at some length the effects of a\r\n\"drink prepared from the tears which exude from poppy heads.\" Pliny in\r\nthe first century A.D. recorded several cases of suicide by means of\r\nopium, which he spoke of as not being a rare occurrence. The drug is\r\nsaid to have been introduced into China by the Arabs in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. An edict prohibiting opium smoking was issued by the emperor\r\nYung Cheng in 1729. It was not until 1909 that the British government\r\nagreed to completely prohibit the importation of morphine into China.\r\nThe sale and use of narcotics has, however, been regulated in India\r\nfor many years. Morphine, the first alkaloid ever discovered, was\r\nisolated and named by Sertürner, a German apothecary, in 1805. Over\r\ntwenty derivatives of opium have been reported since that time. The\r\nreal history of morphinomania, according to Erlenmeyer, began in 1864.\r\nAs far as can be determined, opium was not grown in America until 1865.\r\nIn 1906 it was estimated that over thirteen millions of people were\r\naddicted to opium smoking in China alone.\r\n\r\nThe literature of medicine contains numerous references to the mental\r\ndisturbances due to opium and morphine. Krafft-Ebing[224] says of\r\nthe habitual user that \"Intelligence, it is true, is practically\r\nspared, but the highest mental functions—character, ethic feeling,\r\nself-control, mental energy, and force—always suffer.... In severe\r\ncases we find, in addition, weakness of memory, especially defect in\r\nthe power of exact reproduction, difficulty of intellectual activity\r\nthat may reach the degree of torpor, occasionally psychic depression\r\nreaching even marked dysthymia and taedium vitae, great emotionality,\r\nand, in general, profound deficiency of resistive power to affects; and\r\nbesides, there may be episodically nervous restlessness, excitement,\r\neven attacks of fear due to vasomotor causes, and occasionally\r\nvisual hallucinations.\" He also describes hallucinatory delirious\r\nconditions due to abstinence which strongly suggest alcoholism. In\r\naddition to clouded states of the same kind, Paton[225] speaks of the\r\nearly occurrence, in chronic cases, of marked symptoms of hysteria.\r\nApprehension and anxiety develop with mild suspicions and a moral\r\ndeterioration very similar to that induced by alcohol. There may be\r\nconsiderable irritability and egotism, with a suggestion of flight\r\nof ideas and motor restlessness. Hallucinations and delusions are\r\nsometimes present, particularly if alcoholism is a complicating factor.\r\nHyperesthesias, paresthesias and anesthesias are common. Barker[226]\r\nalso speaks of a degeneration of character evidenced by ethical\r\ndefects, lying, egotism and loss of memory. Under abstinence symptoms\r\nhe includes restlessness, anxiety, despair, vomiting and delirium.\r\nWhite[227] regards the neuropathic diathesis as the most important\r\ncause of the morphine or opium habit. In habitual users he has noted\r\nhallucinated states with a paranoid coloring or a definite delirium.\r\nHe has also observed delusions of persecution and poisoning, but\r\nemphasizes the importance of the gradual mental deterioration.\r\n\r\nOne of the most elaborate studies ever made of morphinism was that of\r\nErlenmeyer,[228] whose work on this subject reached nearly five hundred\r\npages in its third edition. The mental disturbances associated with\r\nintoxication he divides into two groups—transitory and permanent.\r\nThe former includes anxious states, hallucinations of vision and\r\nstuporous attacks; the latter, the intellectual and emotional\r\ndeteriorations already described. There is a definite character\r\nchange strongly suggesting \"moral insanity,\" an artificial \"senium\r\npraecox\" being induced. He also refers to distinct psychoses resulting\r\nfrom chronic morphinism, the most common one being of the paranoid\r\nvariety. Abstinence symptoms of sudden development include collapse\r\nand delirium. Restless anxiety and insomnia may usher in a mild\r\ndelirious condition. Of these he described two forms,—one, a quiet,\r\npartially clouded dream state and another, with excitement, elation\r\nand hallucinations. The first form is the more common. The second\r\nis usually of short duration but may last for several weeks or even\r\nmonths, often manifesting paranoid ideas.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[229] calls attention to the important fact that morphine\r\nstimulates mental activities as well as inhibiting psychomotor\r\nprocesses, and is not therefore a logical drug for the production of\r\nsleep. The habitué feels himself capable of much greater exertions\r\nbut is handicapped by an inhibition of will power. This psychological\r\nmechanism determines the difference between the intoxication of\r\nmorphine and that of alcohol. Nissl found the cortical cells of dogs\r\npoisoned with morphine decreased in size but not destroyed. The\r\nstainable substance was rarefied and weakly stained, the achromatic\r\nsubstance, on the other hand, being unusually prominent. In chronic\r\nmorphinism Kraepelin found memory uncertain, mental capacity\r\ndiminished and fatigability increased. There are alternating periods\r\nof comparatively good health and dull somnolence with exhaustion or\r\nnervous restlessness. The mood is variable,—depressed, discouraged,\r\nhypochondriacal, irritable, or even confident and overbearing. Anxious\r\nstates occasionally occur at night and suicidal attempts may be made.\r\nCharacter changes are also described by Kraepelin. The patients\r\nbecome complaining, oversensitive to pain and to opposition, are\r\nindolent, irresolute, irresponsible and neglect their work. Their\r\ninterest is more and more confined to the drug. Their untruthfulness\r\nand deceitfulness are well known. Sleep is much disturbed, often by\r\nvisual hallucinations. Phantastic delusional ideas are also manifested.\r\nParesthesias and hyperesthesias are common. The reflexes are active\r\nand usually increased. The gait is unsteady or even ataxic. Speech\r\ndisturbances, paralysis of the muscles of the eye, diplopia and loss\r\nof accommodation have been noted. A typical Korsakow's complex was\r\nobserved by Heymann. Appetite is lost, bodily weakness and loss of\r\nweight appear and sugar is often present in the urine. Perspiration,\r\ndizzy spells, confusion and stupor may be caused by circulatory\r\ndisturbances. Sexual power is diminished, and menstrual disturbances\r\nare frequent. These symptoms may appear early or may not develop for\r\nyears, depending on the individual case. Kraepelin also describes\r\nforms similar to dipsomania in alcoholics. He attributes these to\r\nepileptic or hysterical constitutions. Many of his cases were decidedly\r\npsychopathic with tendencies to abuse the use of alcohol, tobacco and\r\ncoffee. Of thirty-eight patients observed by him, nineteen used only\r\none drug, ten of them were addicted to two, eight others to three, and\r\none patient to as many as five. Under abstinence symptoms he includes\r\nexhaustion, restlessness, yawning, sneezing, anxiety, chilliness,\r\noppression, sense deceptions and pains in various parts of the body.\r\nThe patient is sleepless and sometimes goes into an excitement with\r\nsuicidal inclinations. In some cases a condition develops which\r\nmarkedly resembles delirium tremens. In others, hallucinatory symptoms\r\nare more marked. These manifestations may last for several days or for\r\na few weeks. Hysterical dream states with hallucinations and convulsive\r\nseizures may also occur.\r\n\r\nCocaine was first isolated by Gardeka in 1855, but was given the name\r\nit now bears by Niemann. It did not come into extensive use until many\r\nyears later and was not employed generally in ophthalmological practice\r\nuntil about 1884. Freud in 1885 called attention to the fact that small\r\ndoses of cocaine produced a stimulation of the mental activities with\r\neuphoria and an increased capacity for both mental and physical work.\r\nMannheim,[230] who reviewed ninety-nine cases of cocaine poisoning in\r\n1891, found that the first symptoms were drowsiness and deep sleep,\r\noccasionally followed by coma and collapse. He observed that some\r\npatients became restless and excited, dizzy, laughing and crying\r\nalternately, while others were very talkative and uneasy, walking up\r\nand down with a drunken gait. Usually he found a complete amnesia\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe first study of psychoses due to cocaine was made by Erlenmeyer[231]\r\nin 1886. As he afterwards modestly observed, \"This first report on\r\ncocomania, which was founded on thirteen cases, completely exhausted\r\nthe subject, and nothing essential has been added to the symptomatology\r\nthen published.\" He found that it was almost always combined with the\r\nmorphine habit. This was probably due to the fact that cocaine, at one\r\ntime, was used extensively in the treatment of morphinism. Although the\r\nassimilation of food is not affected and gastritis was not a symptom,\r\nErlenmeyer usually found a great decrease in bodily weight, as much as\r\ntwenty to thirty per cent in some cases within a few weeks. Sleep is\r\nmuch disturbed and insomnia the rule. The most common form of mental\r\ndisturbance he found to consist of attacks of violent excitement\r\naccompanied by delusions of persecution. Dangerous, impulsive assaults\r\nmay occur. Very often, however, there were transitory confusional\r\nstates with hallucinations of hearing and vision, succeeded by a mental\r\ndeterioration and loss of memory. Visual hallucinations usually appear\r\nearly. A common and peculiar symptom is the appearance of dark spots\r\nand points on a white background, attributed by Erlenmeyer to multiple\r\nscotomata. Auditory hallucinations he also found to be frequent.\r\nSensory deceptions give rise to peculiar ideas such as the presence of\r\nthe \"cocaine bug\" which the patient often tries to catch. Volubility\r\nis another characteristic feature of the disease which he refers to.\r\nAs abstinence symptoms he describes forms of depression, with weakness\r\nof will power. Barker refers to psychoses of an acute hallucinatory\r\nconfusional type as a result of cocainism.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing speaks of episodic toxic deliria with visual and auditory\r\nhallucinations resembling those of alcohol and accompanied by delusions\r\nof persecution or jealousy with visions of multitudes of small animals,\r\netc. He has not observed delirious conditions due to abstinence.\r\n\r\nIn acute cocainism Kraepelin[232] finds an increased pulse rate, a\r\nlowering of blood pressure and the appearance of an excitement of\r\nthe intoxication type with an agreeable sensation of warmth and\r\nwell-being. There is an initial motor excitement followed eventually\r\nby weakness. This is a somewhat similar reaction to that caused by\r\nalcohol, but it is more marked. Small doses cause the habitué to feel\r\nelated, talkative and inclined to prolific writings. He feels a greatly\r\nincreased efficiency but does not show a corresponding productivity.\r\nLarger doses cause delirious excitement with a tendency to sudden\r\ncollapse. After a prolonged use of the drug a condition of nervous\r\nexcitement ensues, with an increasing susceptibility to intoxication, a\r\nmild flight of ideas, a diminished capacity for mental exertion, loss\r\nof will power and failure of memory. The patient is busy with entirely\r\nuseless activities, quite voluble, and writes incessantly. He becomes\r\nunreliable, forgetful, disorderly and careless in his conduct. The mood\r\nalternates between one of well-being, irritability, suspicious anxiety\r\nand emotional dulness. Kraepelin speaks of the great loss of weight,\r\nincreased reflexes, dilated pupils, rapid pulse, etc. Insomnia is a\r\ncommon symptom. The characteristic psychosis of cocaine, however, in\r\nhis opinion is a paranoid condition somewhat resembling the alcoholic\r\nforms. The onset is usually sudden, with irritability, suspicion\r\nand anxious restlessness, together with the sudden development\r\nof hallucinations of various kinds. Auditory hallucinations are\r\nparticularly numerous and are very active. The patient's surroundings\r\nappear strange and unreal. He sees all kinds of pictures of the most\r\nrealistic type. Tactile hallucinations are very common. The patient\r\noften shoots at his imaginary persecutors or attempts suicide to escape\r\nthem. A typical symptom is the appearance of delusions of jealousy.\r\nWith all of this the patient is usually well oriented. Only\r\noccasionally is there a clouding of consciousness and confusion.\r\nInsight is, however, always lacking. Even with a clear sensorium\r\nthe delusional ideas are firmly retained. The mood is excited,\r\nirritable, sometimes angry and exasperated, but most frequently\r\ndepressed and suspicious. The conduct is characterized by restlessness\r\nand uncertainty. There is usually a marked volubility suggesting a\r\nconscious delirium at times. The whole development of these conditions\r\nis rapid, often within a few weeks. They disappear as quickly in many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nChronic cocainism is very similar to the alcoholic conditions. From\r\na symptomatic point of view, however, the paranoid cocaine psychoses\r\noccupy relatively an intermediate position between alcoholic delirium\r\nand the paranoid states.\r\n\r\nIn experiments on dogs Nissl found a stainability of the achromatic\r\nsubstance in the neurones, a beginning shrinkage of the cell nuclei and\r\na slight increase of leucocytes in the pia and vessels.\r\n\r\nChloral-hydrate, which has been employed medicinally since 1869, is\r\nmuch less frequently a cause of mental disturbance than morphine or\r\ncocaine. Krafft-Ebing describes its use combined usually with other\r\ndrugs as causing moroseness, depression and mental dulness. He speaks,\r\ntoo, of a delirium due to sudden withdrawal. This condition, he says,\r\nmay also be caused by paraldehyde. The craving for chloral, on the\r\npart of those who have acquired the habit, is much less intense than\r\nthat for morphine or cocaine. Other drugs are very readily substituted\r\nfor that reason. A prolonged use leads to digestive disturbances,\r\nconstipation alternating with diarrhea, jaundice, flushing of the face,\r\ncongestion of the conjunctiva, fulness of the head, palpitations, weak\r\npulse, dyspnea and general malnutrition with erythematous, urticareous\r\nor pustular skin eruptions, etc. Hyperesthesias, anesthesias,\r\nparesthesias, pains in the limbs, sensations of heat and cold, tremors,\r\noccasional loss of muscular power and sometimes ataxia appear. The\r\nreflexes are usually decreased. Epileptiform convulsions have been\r\nobserved although they are infrequent. The mental disturbances of\r\nchloral have been studied by Wilson.[233] He describes the habitué as\r\n\"dull, apathetic, somnolent, disposed to neglect his ordinary duties\r\nand affairs. He passes much of his time in a state of dreamy lethargy\r\nor in deep and prolonged sleep, from which he awakes unrefreshed and\r\nin pain.\" Headache is an almost constant symptom. It is associated\r\nwith \"confusion of thought, inability to converse intelligently or to\r\narticulate distinctly, and other evidences of cerebral congestion.\"\r\nVertigo is also common. The mental state is characterized by dulness,\r\napathy and confusion, alternating with periods of irritability and\r\nrestlessness. The depression is not so marked as in morphinism.\r\nInability to concentrate the mind, loss of memory, and intellectual\r\nenfeeblement are terminal conditions. Occasionally in the worst cases\r\nhallucinations, delusions, clouding and states of excitement are\r\nobserved. Abstinence symptoms are headache, insomnia, neuralgia, pains\r\nin the limbs, nervousness, restlessness and formication. A delirium\r\nsimilar to that of alcoholism has been referred to by various writers.\r\n\r\nCasamajor[234] has described two types of mental disturbance due to the\r\nuse of bromides,—a condition of apathy with dulness and an active\r\ndelirium. The first is characterized by apathy, dulness, somnolence,\r\nweakness and failing memory, and is often observed in epileptics who\r\nhave been subjected to protracted periods of bromide treatment. He\r\nhas also reported toxic deliria showing marked hallucinations with\r\npsychomotor unrest, fabrications and paraphasia. This may be associated\r\nwith unequal, sluggish pupils, increased or unequal patellar reflexes,\r\ntremors, ankle clonus and an unsteady gait—a general condition\r\nsuggesting paresis. Hoch[235] also reported cases showing\r\nhallucinations, clouding, disorientation, amnesia, fabrications and\r\naphasic disturbances, together with physical signs simulating general\r\nparesis. O'Malley and Franz[236] described somewhat similar symptoms\r\nin a case showing dilated sluggish pupils, exaggerated knee-jerks,\r\nankle clonus, tremors and unsteady gait, etc. The mental disturbance\r\nwas characterized by a confused dreamlike state, with hallucinations,\r\nmemory defect, a disturbance of attention, and a marked tendency to\r\nfabrication. The fabrication in their opinion suggested a delirious\r\norigin rather than the Korsakow complex.\r\n\r\nThe first references to the psychoses caused by lead intoxication were\r\napparently those of Dehäne in 1771. Tanquerel des Planches published\r\nhis \"Encephalopathia Saturnina\" in 1836. He recognized three forms\r\nof this condition,—the delirious, the comatose and the convulsive.\r\nEdsall[237] describes as encephalopathies all of the cerebral symptoms\r\ndue to chronic lead poisoning. In addition to transitory hemiplegias,\r\naphasia and choreiform movements, he refers to the occurrence of\r\nhysterical manifestations, such as hemianesthesias associated with\r\noutbursts of excitement. Coma and clouded states often occur. These\r\nmay be accompanied by convulsions. In the delirious form there may\r\nbe a marked excitement with psychomotor activity. Hallucinations are\r\ncommon, particularly in alcoholic cases. Delusions of persecution are\r\nnot infrequent. There is usually a rise of temperature throughout\r\nthe attack. The delirium may last from a few days to several weeks.\r\nSymptom complexes strongly suggesting general paresis have been\r\nreported. Krafft-Ebing speaks of psychoses characterized by mental\r\ndepression, feelings of oppression, irritability, mild delusions of\r\npersecution and terrifying hallucinations. Epileptiform attacks,\r\nparalyses and tremors are also mentioned. He refers to deliria which\r\nmay arise spontaneously or follow an initial stupor, and speaks of the\r\nchronic lead psychoses as toxic hallucinatory confusional conditions.\r\nSix cases of this nature were reported by Bartens in 1887. Oppenheim\r\nhas occasionally found hysterical symptoms associated with chronic\r\nlead poisoning. Rayner[238] found mental disturbances preceded by\r\nsuch premonitory symptoms as headache, restlessness, disturbed sleep,\r\nterrifying dreams, tinnitus aurium, flashes of light, difficulty of\r\nthought, and depression. This terminated in a few days in a delirium\r\ncharacterized by anxiety and visual hallucinations. Other cases showed\r\na more marked depression and stupor, sometimes alternating with\r\ndelirium and violent excitement, accompanied by hallucinations and\r\nspeech defects. Amaurosis and convulsions are spoken of frequently as\r\ncommon symptoms. Conditions similar to general paresis have been noted\r\nby various observers.\r\n\r\nThere have been very few contributions to medical literature on\r\nthe subject of psychoses caused by arsenic. In discussing forms of\r\npoisoning due to that drug Edsall expressed the opinion that \"marked\r\npsychic symptoms are unusual.\" Casamajor makes the statement that \"in\r\nvery severe cases memory disturbances have been noted, and in some the\r\ntypical Korsakow polyneuritic psychosis.\" According to Oppenheim a\r\nrise of temperature associated with a delirium may be observed at the\r\nonset of arsenical poisoning and may also occur later in the disease.\r\nPsychoses due to arsenic were not referred to by Krafft-Ebing, Arndt,\r\nSchüle, Ziehen or Kraepelin.\r\n\r\nEdsall[239] mentions as the symptoms of chronic mercurial poisoning,\r\nheadache, restlessness, mental depression and weakness. Most striking\r\nfeatures are tremors and a peculiar emotional disturbance referred to\r\nas \"erythism.\" Tremors of the lips and facial muscles are common and\r\nspeech disturbance and choreiform movements have been noted. Symptoms\r\nsuggesting neurasthenia and hysteria have also been reported. Naunyn\r\nhas described excitements due to mercury characterized by anxiety and\r\nfears with hallucinations and sleeplessness. He also speaks of manic\r\nattacks, depressions and mental deterioration as associated conditions.\r\n\r\nArgyria or chronic silver poisoning is said to be accompanied often by\r\na marked sensitiveness and occasional episodes of actual depression due\r\nto the discoloration and pigmentation of the face.\r\n\r\nPsychoses due to various gases are occasionally encountered.\r\nIlluminating gas is a rather common means of suicide, as is shown by\r\nthe newspapers. It has been found that the cause of death in these\r\ncases is carbon monoxide, which is also often reported as responsible\r\nfor the asphyxiation of workmen in garages and other places where\r\ngasoline motors are used. This occasionally results from the improper\r\nventilation of laundries, engine rooms, gas plants, iron foundries,\r\netc. These conditions have been very fully studied by O'Malley.[240]\r\nThe mental disorders due to carbon monoxide are described as being\r\ncharacterized by a sudden attack of confusion and clouding associated\r\nwith a period of complete amnesia. There may be disturbances of\r\nattention and Korsakow's psychosis is sometimes strongly suggested,\r\nwith memory impairment and tendencies towards fabrication. This\r\ncondition may be transitory or last for many months. On recovery\r\nthe patient usually has no recollection of any events taking place\r\nafter the time of the poisoning. Immediately following the initial\r\nunconsciousness there may be excited periods or delirious states\r\nwith aphasic disturbances. In chronic cases delusions of persecution\r\nare often observed. The psychosis frequently does not develop until\r\nseveral weeks or months after the actual poisoning. Several observers\r\nhave referred to a mask-like expression of the face, with emotional\r\nindifference, apathy and outbursts of laughter. The mood has been\r\ndescribed as characterized by emotional instability. O'Malley calls\r\nattention to the important fact that the mental disturbance may have\r\nbeen the cause of suicidal attempts rather than a result of the gas\r\npoisoning. Confused delirious states due to carbon monoxide poisoning,\r\nalso conditions resembling Korsakow's disease, have been described by\r\nKraepelin. Several cases somewhat similar to that described by O'Malley\r\nhave been observed at the Boston State Hospital.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the statistics of American institutions shows that\r\npsychoses due to drugs and other exogenous poisons are quite rare in\r\nthis country. They represented only .39 per cent of the admissions to\r\nthe New York state hospitals during a period of eight years. The number\r\nadmitted to Massachusetts hospitals is still less. In a total of 70,987\r\nfirst admissions to forty-eight hospitals in sixteen different states\r\nthere were only 324 cases due to exogenous poisons. This constituted\r\n.65 per cent of the total number admitted. It is interesting to note\r\nthat during a period of eight years, when 49,640 cases were admitted to\r\nthe New York state hospitals, 154 cases of psychosis due to opium or\r\nmorphine were reported, five due to metallic poisons, eighteen caused\r\nby gases, and nine of types unspecified. No case of uncomplicated\r\ncocainism was reported during that period of time.\r\n\r\nThe 314 drug habitués in the state hospitals of the entire country as\r\nshown by the census of January 1, 1920, and reported by the National\r\nCommittee for Mental Hygiene, represented .15 per cent of the mental\r\ncases under treatment in those institutions on the same date. The 808\r\ndrug addicts shown by the same census in all of the institutions of the\r\nUnited States, both public and private, represented .34 per cent of\r\nthe mental cases reported by them. The fact that the private hospitals\r\nshowed 4.5 per cent of drug cases in the same census is significant.\r\nIt indicates that these cases are largely cared for in institutions of\r\nthat type, and furthermore, that their number is very small.\r\n\r\nThe result of the investigations made in 1919 by a committee appointed\r\nby the Secretary of the United States Treasury is of great interest in\r\nview of the number of drug psychoses treated in our state hospitals.\r\nThe committee's report[241] shows an estimated annual per capita use\r\nof opium in Italy of 1.25 grains; Germany, two grains; France, three;\r\nHolland, 3.5; and the United States, thirty-three grains. More opium\r\nis consumed here than in any other country in the world. The committee\r\nwas of the opinion that ninety per cent of it was used for other than\r\nmedicinal purposes. The estimated number of habitués in New York\r\nCity at that time as reported by the City Commissioner of Health was\r\n103,000. The questionnaire sent out by the committee to physicians\r\nregistered under the Harrison Act showed that the number of cases\r\nunder treatment for morphinism in various parts of the country was as\r\nfollows:—California, 3,338; Connecticut, 11,740; Illinois, 8,218;\r\nIndiana, 8,438; Massachusetts, 14,770; New Jersey, 5,900; New York,\r\n37,095; Pennsylvania, 10,202, etc. The estimated number of drug users\r\nin the United States was given at one million, and the amount of money\r\nexpended by them annually was said to approximate sixty-one million\r\ndollars. In view of these statements the number of psychoses reported\r\nin the hospitals is astonishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH PELLAGRA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of pellagra is shrouded in mystery. Although first described\r\nby Casal, the name now attached to the disease was suggested by\r\nFrappoli in 1771. He referred to it as of ancient origin at that time\r\nand probably identical with the \"pellarella\" reported in Milan in\r\n1578. Niles[242] is of the opinion that the peculiar malady existing\r\namong the American Indians and mentioned by Baruino in 1600 was almost\r\ncertainly pellagra. It is interesting to note that he attributed it\r\nto the use of corn. The disease was observed in Spain by Gaspar Casal\r\nin 1735 and appeared in Italy about twenty-five years later. Of the\r\n4,404 admissions to the St. Clement's Hospital at Venice between 1873\r\nand 1880 over thirty per cent showed symptoms of pellagra. In 1912,\r\naccording to Niles, the number of cases in Italy was estimated at\r\napproximately one hundred thousand. The disease was apparently first\r\nreported in France in 1818. It has been common in Egypt since 1892 at\r\nleast and is said to have occurred there as early as 1847. Cases were\r\nreported in this country by John P. Gray at the Utica State Hospital\r\nand by Tyler at the McLean Hospital, in Somerville, Massachusetts, in\r\n1863. It is now thought to have been very common in the Andersonville\r\nand Libby prisons during the civil war, although not diagnosed as such\r\nat the time.\r\n\r\nFew cases were reported in this country prior to 1907, when it was\r\nfound to be present at the Columbia, South Carolina, State Hospital\r\nby Babcock. Pellagra constituted seven per cent of the admissions to\r\nthat institution in 1908, fifteen per cent in 1909, twenty in 1910,\r\nover twenty-seven in 1911 and twenty-six per cent in 1915. Sixty-one\r\nper cent of the deaths in the hospital during the latter year were\r\ndue to that disease. The health officer of the state reported four\r\nhundred cases in South Carolina in 1909 and six thousand in 1914.\r\nBabcock is now of the opinion that pellagra undoubtedly existed for\r\ntwenty years or more at Columbia before its significance was known.\r\nIn 1910 the disease was found to be present in thirty different\r\nstates and represented about three thousand cases.[243] Of these the\r\nlargest numbers were in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina,\r\nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Illinois. The\r\nimportance of this question had already been recognized and a national\r\nconference was held on the subject at Columbia in 1909. During the\r\nsame year the governor of Illinois appointed a commission to make a\r\nthorough study of pellagra in that state. The disease has been made\r\nthe subject of elaborate investigation and study by the United States\r\nPublic Health Service and several publications have been issued by that\r\ndepartment.[244]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the extended discussion and scientific research of the\r\nlast few years, the question as to the definite etiology of pellagra\r\nhas not as yet been positively settled. The maize or Indian corn theory\r\nwas first advocated by Mazari in 1810. He believed the symptoms to be\r\ndue to a deficiency in gluten. Sette in 1826 attributed the disease to\r\na fungus (scimelpige) growing on corn and producing a poison from the\r\noil in the grain. The smut of corn, \"Ustilago Maydis,\" was suggested\r\nas a possible factor by Pari in 1860. In 1872 Lombroso formulated his\r\ntoxic theory: \"In pellagra we are dealing with an intoxication produced\r\nby poisons developed in spoiled corn through the action of certain\r\nmicroorganisms, in themselves harmless to man.\" He also announced the\r\ndiscovery of \"pellagrosein,\" a toxic substance extracted from spoiled\r\ncorn. In 1902 Ceni advanced the theory that the disease was caused\r\nby the action of certain moulds such as the aspergillus fumigatus\r\nand flavescens. The Illinois Pellagra Commission in 1911 came to the\r\nconclusion after an elaborate investigation of the subject that the\r\nprimary etiological factor involved was a living microorganism of\r\nunknown nature, that the probable source of infection was through the\r\nintestinal tract and that a deficient amount of animal protein in the\r\ndiet probably acted as a predisposing cause. Funk in 1914 suggested\r\na vitamin deficiency in the diet brought about by the consumption of\r\novermilled corn. Voegtlin[245] in the same year expressed the opinion\r\nthat the disease was essentially a chronic intoxication,—\"While the\r\nagents at work in this intoxication are as yet unknown, I am inclined\r\nto believe that toxic substances exist in certain vegetable foods, not\r\nnecessarily spoiled, which, if consumed by man over a long period of\r\ntime, may produce an injurious effect on certain organs of the body....\r\nIt is probably more than a mere coincidence that the population of\r\nthat part of the world in which pellagra is endemic lives on a mainly\r\nvegetable diet.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1916 a study was made by Koch and Voegtlin[246] of the chemical\r\nchanges found in the nervous system in pellagra which was very\r\nsignificant in its results. They found an increase in water with a\r\ndecrease in proteins and lipoids, the latter reaction being attributed\r\nto a degeneration in the white matter. There was also a relative\r\nincrease in the cholesterol content, looked upon as a compensatory\r\nprotective function tending to replace the loss in lipoids. The most\r\nmarked chemical alterations were found in the cord. On feeding monkeys\r\nand rats with an exclusive vegetable diet, changes in the chemical\r\nreaction of the brain and cord of almost exactly the same type were\r\nbrought about experimentally.\r\n\r\nGoldberger[247] in 1916 made an interesting report of a series of\r\ninvestigations carried on by the United States Public Health Service\r\nat Jackson, Mississippi. A large number of cases of pellagra were\r\ntreated by largely supplementing the dietary with fresh meats, milk\r\nand leguminous vegetables. The carbohydrate content was reduced at\r\nthe same time but corn was not entirely discontinued. Of 209 cases\r\nstudied, 172 remained under continuous observation with a recurrence of\r\nsymptoms in only one case. In a similar experiment made at the Georgia\r\nState Sanitarium seventy-two patients, all of whom had shown attacks\r\npreviously, were treated for a year without symptoms. A number of\r\nvolunteers at the Mississippi State Penitentiary were given a test diet\r\nconsisting of wheat flour, corn meal, grits, cornstarch, white polished\r\nrice, granulated sugar, cane syrup, sweet potatoes, pork fat, cabbage,\r\ncollards, turnip greens and coffee. Of the eleven convicts receiving\r\nthis diet, six developed a typical dermatitis with slight nervous and\r\ngastrointestinal symptoms. The results of these investigations were not\r\noffered by the United States Public Health Service as being conclusive\r\nand incontrovertible evidence as to the etiology of pellagra, which\r\nmust still be looked upon as being somewhat in doubt. The dietetic\r\nfactors concerned in the production of the disease have been under\r\nserious consideration for a century or more.\r\n\r\nThis information was supplemented by a study of pellagra in the general\r\npopulation of the cotton mill communities in South Carolina.[248] In\r\ncomparing the dietaries of pellagrous households with those of the\r\nfamilies escaping infection it was found that the former consumed\r\nless meat, milk, butter, cheese and eggs. The value of their diet in\r\ncalories and proteins was lower. The proteins contributed, moreover,\r\nwere more largely from cereals, peas, beans, etc. The carbohydrate\r\ncontent was also lower. They concluded that the particular points\r\ninvolved were:\r\n\r\n\"1. A physiologically defective protein supply,\r\n\r\n\"2. A low or inadequate supply of fat-soluble vitamin,\r\n\r\n\"3. A low or inadequate supply of water-soluble vitamin, and\r\n\r\n\"4. A defective mineral supply.\"\r\n\r\nThey were also of the opinion that the disease could be prevented by\r\n\"including in the diet an adequate supply of animal protein foods\r\n(particularly milk, including butter, and lean meat).\"\r\n\r\nRoberts[249] in 1920 made a study of twenty-five cases of pellagra\r\nencountered in private practice. In every instance the disease\r\ndeveloped in families provided with an abundance of food of all kinds.\r\nAn analysis of the actual consumption, however, showed that \"not one\r\nof the patients ate a well rounded, balanced diet of meat, milk, eggs\r\nor wholesome vegetables.\" Either they were suffering from a lack of\r\nnourishment in every case or they were eating practically the same\r\ndiet that Goldberger used experimentally in producing pellagra.\r\n\r\nAs defined by Barker[250] pellagra \"is a disease characterized by\r\npeculiar cutaneous, digestive, nervous and mental disturbances, usually\r\nrunning a chronic course, with periodic exacerbation, but sometimes\r\ndeveloping acutely and proceeding quickly to a fatal termination.\"\r\nHe speaks of the disease as developing during the winter months\r\nusually with neurasthenic manifestations—fatigability, insomnia,\r\nslight vertigo, and feelings of apprehension, followed by digestive\r\ndisturbances later in the spring. The parts of the skin surface exposed\r\nto the sun develop an erythema followed by a dermatitis. Nervous and\r\nmental symptoms may appear later. In some cases the disease tends\r\nto recur every spring. The skin lesions have been described as a\r\ncharacteristic \"mask\" shown on the face, the pellagrous collar, a\r\nbandlike eruption on the neck, Casal's \"necklace\" extending downwards\r\nover the sternum, the pellagrous \"butterfly,\" \"gauntlets,\" etc. The\r\nmore common digestive disorders are stomatitis and glossitis, gastric\r\ndisturbances and diarrhea. Neurological symptoms observed include\r\nhyperesthesia, paresthesia, anesthesia, tremors, paralyses, muscular\r\npains, increased reflexes and occasional convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe literature of pellagra and its associated mental disturbances has\r\nbeen elaborately reviewed by Babcock.[251] The following references\r\nappear in a comprehensive study of this subject made by him in 1910.\r\nGriesinger[252] described the pellagrous psychoses as characterized by a\r\nvague, incoherent delirium, accompanied by loquacity and loss of memory\r\nwithout any violent excitement or special disorder of the intelligence.\r\nThe depression gradually develops into a torpor of all the mental\r\npowers together with muscular weakness, a condition resembling general\r\nparesis. Mongeri[253] states that the psychoses usually begin with a\r\nperiod of depression accompanied by hypochondriacal ideas. This is\r\nfollowed by confusion and hallucinations of hearing. Delusions of\r\npersecution appear, with a marked tendency to suicide by drowning.\r\nCrimes of various kinds may be caused by the paranoid condition which\r\nusually terminates in deterioration. In speaking of chronic and acute\r\nforms Bianchi[254] says: \"The former is characterized by general\r\ndepression, melancholia, confusion, slow dementia, paresthesias and\r\nataxic gait. Contractures and subsulti are absent, although in most\r\ninstances the reflexes are exaggerated. In the acute form we have\r\nrapid elevation of temperature, 39° to 41° C.; intense neuro-muscular\r\nexcitement, subsulti, contractures, muscular rigidity, exaggerated\r\nreflexes and confusion with phases of exaltation. There are numerous\r\nintermediate forms in which we observe a great variety of psychical\r\nphenomena, and also alternations of excitement and depression. Phases\r\nof remission and of apparent recovery are observed, especially at\r\ncertain seasons.\" Régis[255] is quoted as follows: \"It is recognized\r\nthat the most common form of psychosis in pellagra is mental confusion\r\nwith melancholy or dreamy delirium. This occurs more or less markedly\r\nin most of the cases. It is manifested by inertia, a passivity, an\r\nindifference, a considerable torpor; by insomnia, hallucinations often\r\nterrifying, both of sight and hearing; by delirious conceptions\r\nwith fixed ideas of hopelessness, of damnation, of fear, anxiety,\r\npersecution, poisoning; of possession by devils and witches, of refusal\r\nof food, and so marked a tendency to suicide, and to suicide by\r\ndrowning, that Strombio gave it the name hydromania. This melancholy\r\ndepression, which can reach, in certain cases, even to stupor, is\r\nalways based upon a foundation of obtusion, of intellectual hebetude,\r\nand of considerable general debility, which becomes permanent and\r\nterminates by degrees in dementia, in proportion as the pellagrous\r\ncachexia makes new progress. It is accompanied sometimes by a\r\npolyneuritis. The mental confusion of pellagrins can, in place of\r\nchanging directly into dementia, turn to a chronic mental confusion.\r\nOne may observe in pellagra, as in every grave intoxication, a\r\nmorbid state resembling general paresis (pellagrous pseudo-general\r\nparesis). This occurs especially in the cases where instead of habitual\r\nmelancholy ideas, the patients present ideas of satisfaction and of\r\nwealth.\" Procopiu[256] found his patients \"sad, apathetic, silent;\r\nin the more advanced stage they are melancholy, and fall sometimes\r\ninto an absolute mutism, or respond with difficulty, and have the air\r\nof not understanding what is said to them. Sometimes this melancholy\r\nis accompanied with stupor, and leads the poor pellagrins into\r\ndementia.\" He also speaks of the occurrence of sudden outbursts of\r\nmanic excitement. Tanzi[257] refers to the existence of both pellagrous\r\nmania and melancholia but speaks of a characteristic amentia \"which\r\nmanifests itself acutely in loss of time and place, loss of memory,\r\nconfusion, hallucinations, and paresthesias, from which there arise\r\nmorbid impulses and delusions. Pellagrous amentia, often assumes a\r\ndepressive form, which simulates melancholia, and in some cases either\r\nfrom time to time, or throughout the whole course of the psychosis, it\r\nis accompanied by exaltation, which gives it some resemblance to mania.\"\r\n\r\nGregor[258] in 1907 made a careful analysis of seventy-two cases. He\r\nclassified these in seven groups: 1. Neurasthenia; 2. Acute stuporous\r\ndementia; 3. Amentia (acute confusional insanity); 4. Acute delirium;\r\n5. Katatonia; 6. Anxiety psychoses; and 7. Manic-depressive insanity.\r\nThe neurasthenic cases (9.72 per cent) exhibited headache, pain in the\r\ngastric region, vertigo, paresthesia and lassitude, with a sense of\r\nunrest and anxiety as well as ill-defined apprehensions. There was a\r\nsense of mental incapacity and feeling of illness, together with a mild\r\ndepression and hypochondriacal tendencies. The cases diagnosed as acute\r\ndementia (13.88 per cent) were of the same general type but with more\r\nadvanced symptoms. These showed a decided stupor, tending to remission,\r\ndeep mental depression, a sense of insufficiency and \"peculiar\r\nsubjective troubles.\" The tendency to suicide was prominent and caused\r\nthis group to be called melancholia by some. Many cases showed the\r\ngradual development of an affectless stupor. Catatonic symptoms and\r\nstereotypies occasionally occurred. Memory disturbances were well\r\nmarked in this form. The psychoses disappeared invariably with the\r\nsymptoms of the pellagra. The Amentia group (44.44 per cent) included\r\nlong-continued cases with remission and intermissions. Terrifying\r\nhallucinations and violent motor excitement appeared frequently,\r\nfollowed by a stupor which was sometimes interrupted by delirium.\r\nHallucinations were usually present and some had dream states. These\r\ncases often terminate unfavorably. Acute delirium constituted 2.7 per\r\ncent of the seventy-two cases, and katatonia occurred in 13.8 per cent.\r\nThese cases passed rapidly into dementia. Anxiety psychoses (4.16\r\nper cent) were diagnosed in a few instances, but were complicated\r\nby occasional stupors. Two and seven-tenths per cent of the cases\r\nwere classified as manic-depressive insanity. Mobley, according to\r\nBabcock, found the following types represented at the Georgia State\r\nSanitarium:—1. Acute intoxication psychosis, with psychomotor\r\nsuspension; 2. Infective exhaustive psychosis, with psychomotor\r\nretardation or excitation; 3. Symptomatic melancholia with psychomotor\r\nretardation; and 4. Manic-depressive psychoses.\r\n\r\nSinger[259] in 1915 suggested the following classification of the\r\npsychoses associated with pellagra:—\r\n\r\n 1. Disorders directly due to the pellagra toxin:\r\n   (a) Symptomatic depression; (b) Delirious pictures.\r\n 2. Disorders based on peculiarities in personal make-up, the attack of\r\n       \"insanity\" being precipitated by pellagra;\r\n   (a) Manic-depressive disorders; (b) Hysteria; (c) Psychasthenia; (d)\r\n       Dementia praecox; (e) Paranoic developments; and\r\n 3. Disorders due to definite brain changes with pellagra merely as a\r\n       complication:\r\n   (a) Arteriosclerotic dementia; (b) Senile dementia; (c) Presenile\r\n       psychoses; (d) General paralysis of the insane.\r\n\r\nHe found mental disturbances of some kind in about forty per cent of\r\nthe cases examined. As a general rule they appeared after the patient\r\nhad shown evidence of several attacks of the disease. The psychoses\r\noccurred in men between the ages of twenty-one and forty and in women\r\nbetween forty-one and sixty. About ninety-five per cent of the mental\r\ndisorders were to be attributed directly to the effect of the toxin.\r\nThe remaining five per cent represented individuals with a defective\r\nnervous organization or were purely incidental complications.\r\nSinger found peculiarities in make-up associated frequently with a\r\npredisposition to pellagra. He also expressed the opinion that chronic\r\nforms of \"insanity\" are very rarely caused by the diseases.\r\n\r\nSandy[260] made a study of 160 cases at the state hospital at Columbia,\r\nSouth Carolina, in 1916 based on a classification of psychoses quite\r\nsimilar to the one now in use. He found that thirty-five per cent\r\nof these belonged to the infective exhaustive group. As a matter of\r\nfact, this is the conclusion almost anyone would reach from reading\r\nthe observations of the earlier writers. These cases were usually\r\ncharacterized by \"more or less marked delirium, being accompanied\r\nby some confusion and disorientation, there frequently being also\r\nhallucinations accompanied by more or less agitation and restlessness.\"\r\nPhysically he found, besides well marked symptoms of pellagra,\r\nevidences of severe exhaustion, loss of weight, emaciation, fever,\r\nsordes, anorexia, and typhoid facies. \"In the milder forms of these\r\n'delirious pictures,' as Singer calls them in his contribution to the\r\nreport of the Thompson-McFadden Pellagra Commission, and as he pointed\r\nout, the periods of clouding (of consciousness) may be quite brief\r\nand episodic. In such cases in the intervals when the consciousness\r\nis practically clear, the general attitude is one of symptomatic\r\ndepression.\" Sandy found characteristic manic-depressive forms in\r\neleven per cent of the series reviewed. The depressed types were more\r\ncommon. Here he found retardation of speech and action with a dearth\r\nof ideas. In these cases he looks upon pellagra as being merely an\r\nexciting etiological factor. The prognosis was not so favorable,\r\nhowever, as it usually is in manic-depressive psychoses, death often\r\nbeing due to the development of central neuritis. In three per cent\r\nof the total he found what could only be described as symptomatic\r\ndepressions, the emotional condition not being so marked as one would\r\nexpect in the manic-depressive group. In twelve per cent a diagnosis of\r\ndementia praecox was made. In these the pellagra was merely an incident\r\nand not an etiological factor.\r\n\r\nIn several patients Sandy found a symptom complex strongly suggestive\r\nof general paresis, thus confirming the findings of other observers.\r\nThese showed speech and writing defects, absent or sluggish pupillary\r\nreaction, swaying in the Romberg position, altered deep reflexes,\r\ndisorientation, memory disorders and other evidences of deterioration.\r\nThe Wassermann reactions were negative in both the blood and spinal\r\nfluid tests and no lymphocytosis was shown on cell counts. These\r\ncases he thinks belong in the infective exhaustive group, and\r\nusually die of central neuritis, a condition already referred to and\r\ndescribed originally by Turner and Meyer. Sandy also found pellagra\r\nassociated with various senile psychoses. This group constituted ten\r\nper cent of those studied. Fourteen per cent of the series he left\r\nunclassified owing to lack of history, etc. Some of these showed\r\nsimple deterioration, others suggested neurasthenia, and some, general\r\nparesis. Of the remaining cases three were epileptic imbeciles,\r\nthree, constitutional inferiority with episodes of some kind, and\r\nthree were not insane. Cases associated with chorea and hysteria\r\nwere also observed. On analyzing these most important findings the\r\nassumption would seem to be warranted that pellagra is an incident\r\nin certain psychoses—(senility and dementia praecox), that it is a\r\nprecipitating factor in certain cases (manic-depressive), and that the\r\ncharacteristic conditions due to the disease are toxic and assume the\r\ninfective-exhaustive form, occasionally simulating general paresis.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Association's committee on statistics in the\r\ndifferentiation of these conditions is shown by the following quotation\r\non this subject from the last edition of the manual:—\r\n\r\n\"The relation which various mental disturbances bear to the disease\r\npellagra is not yet settled. Cases of pellagra occurring during the\r\ncourse of a well established mental disease such as dementia praecox,\r\nmanic-depressive insanity, senile dementia, etc., should not be\r\nincluded in this group. The mental disturbances which are apparently\r\nmost intimately connected with pellagra are certain delirious or\r\nconfused states (toxic-organ-like reactions) arising during the course\r\nof a severe pellagra. These are the cases which for the present should\r\nbe placed in the group of psychoses with pellagra.\"\r\n\r\nA study of recent statistics would tend to show that pellagra is not at\r\nthis time a factor of importance in our institutions. In Massachusetts\r\nin 1919 the admission rate for this disease was .33 per cent. In New\r\nYork state hospitals during a period of eight years it was only .03\r\nper cent. In twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other states it amounted\r\nto only 1.28 per cent. This includes a number of institutions in the\r\nsouth. There were 263 cases (.37 per cent) in 70,987 first admissions\r\nto forty-eight hospitals in sixteen different states. The admissions\r\nreported from the southern institutions indicate that pellagrous\r\npsychoses are comparatively infrequent as a rule. During the year 1918\r\npellagra constituted 10.7 per cent of the admissions to the Columbia\r\nState Hospital. During the biennial period of 1917 and 1918 the\r\nadmission rate at the Arkansas State Hospital for Nervous Diseases was\r\n8.31 per cent. None were admitted to the Spring Grove State Hospital\r\nat Catonsville, Maryland. In 1919 the admission rate at the Western\r\nState Hospital at Staunton, Virginia, was 1.14 per cent, at the Central\r\nState Hospital, Petersburg, Virginia, 1.39 per cent, and at the Georgia\r\nState Sanitarium at Milledgeville, 2.49 per cent. One and sixty-one\r\nhundredths per cent of the admissions to the Louisiana State Hospital\r\nduring 1920 were diagnosed as psychoses due to pellagra. Very few cases\r\nare reported in the northern institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH OTHER SOMATIC DISEASES\r\n\r\n\r\nMental disturbances of various types associated with somatic\r\nconditions and not sufficiently characteristic or circumscribed in\r\ntheir symptomatology to constitute definite and separate psychoses\r\nhave long been recognized. That delirium is a complicating factor in\r\ncertain acute febrile diseases has been known for centuries. Aristotle\r\ncalled attention to the occurrence of hallucinations and illusions\r\nduring the course of fevers. Hippocrates referred frequently, not only\r\nto excitements, but to delirium and phrenitis. The word \"delirus\"\r\nappears in several places in the works of Horace and many of the\r\nearly authors apparently used this term as synonymous with both mania\r\nand melancholia. That was probably true of Sennert. Flemming in 1844\r\nmentioned fever delirium, hallucinatory and delusional clouded states\r\nand an encephalitic form in addition to the various alcoholic types.\r\nSydenham referred to the mental symptoms associated with malaria and\r\nBright in his original \"Reports\" described other delirious conditions\r\nat some length. Sir Thomas Watson showed that the brain was uninvolved\r\nat autopsy in the acute rheumatic affections with apparent cerebral\r\ncomplications. Mental symptoms have, of course, been associated\r\nfor hundreds of years with meningitic processes. Diabetic coma was\r\nalso recognized long since. Griesinger is said by some to have been\r\nthe first to call attention to the psychoses caused by the acute\r\ninfections. Post febrile mental disturbances were, however, referred\r\nto by Sydenham, Baillarger, Westphal, Greenfield, Gubler and many\r\nothers. Delasiauve very elaborately described the psychoses associated\r\nwith typhoid fever in 1849. The mental disorders accompanying gout were\r\ndiscussed at considerable length by Sydenham and were referred to as\r\nearly as 1699 by Philander Misaurus.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bucknill and Tuke[261], Misaurus made the following\r\nvery interesting suggestions in an article entitled \"The Honour of\r\nthe Gout\": \"It would be worth inquiry, whether the gout is not as\r\neffectual against madness; and we may reasonably believe that it is\r\nso, if upon examination, it should be found that there are no gouty\r\npeople in Bedlam; and then for the recovery of these poor creatures to\r\ntheir wits again, it will not need much consideration, whether they\r\nought not to be excused the hard blows which their barbarous keepers\r\ndeal them, and the Therapeutic method of Purging, Bleeding, Cupping,\r\nFluxing, Vomiting, Clystering, Juleps, Apozemes, Powders, Confections,\r\nEpithemes, Cataplasms, with which the more barbarous Doctors torment\r\nthem, and instead of their learned Torture, indulged for a time only,\r\na little intemperance as to wine, or women, or so; or the scholar's\r\ndelight of feeding worthily, and sleeping heartily, whereby they might\r\nget the Gout, and then their madness were cured.\" Clouston described\r\na very definite form of phthisical insanity. Van der Kolk made the\r\nsurprising statement that phthisis and mania often alternated in\r\nregular cycles. Nasse classified the mental conditions associated with\r\nfevers as either resulting directly from the febrile disturbance,\r\nconstituting a prolongation of the delirium after the temperature\r\nsubsided, or developing during convalescence.\r\n\r\nThe German psychiatrists during the first part of the nineteenth\r\ncentury were divided into two quite separate groups. One of these\r\ninsisted that all mental diseases were purely psychic in origin, and\r\nthe other, that they were in all instances directly attributable to\r\nsomatic disease processes. The former school was ably represented by\r\nHeinroth and Ideler and the latter by Jacobi, Nasse and Friedreich.\r\nThis led to a controversy which lasted for many years. Heinroth's views\r\nwere illustrated by his statement[262] that \"Insanity is the loss of\r\nmoral liberty. It never depends upon a physical cause; it is not a\r\ndisease of the body but of the mind—a sin.... The man who has during\r\nhis whole life before his eyes and in his heart the image of God, has\r\nno reason to fear that he will ever lose his reason.... Man possesses\r\na certain moral power which cannot be conquered by any physical power,\r\nand which only falls under the weight of his own faults.... From wrong\r\ndoing springs all misfortune, including the disorders of the mind.\"\r\nHis principal work was a \"Lehrbuch der Seelenkunde,\" published in\r\nLeipsic in 1818. The teachings of the psychic school were summarized by\r\nvon Feuchtersleben[263] as follows:—\"The mind is the immediate seat\r\nof the disease, the bodily suffering is secondary. Mental disorders\r\nmay be clearly traced to their origin, Sin, Error, Passion. Diseases\r\nof the brain, on the contrary, and of all the organs, occur, even in\r\ntheir greatest intensity, without mental disturbance, as also the\r\nlatter without the former. The psychical mode of cure is that which is\r\nproperly efficient; the somatic remedies in reality act psychically;\r\nfor instance through pain, diversion of the thoughts, stupefaction,\r\nterror. Pathological anatomy has not discovered any decided relation\r\nbetween disorganization of the brain and mental disorders.\" In 1836\r\nFriedreich[264]in opposing Heinroth's views outlined thirteen reasons\r\nfor believing that all psychic disorders were somatic in origin:—\"1.\r\nBecause the mind cannot become diseased; 2. because the greater part\r\nof the causes producing those conditions is somatic; 3. because in all\r\nmental disorders there are somatic symptoms in addition; 4. because\r\nthey are too permanent for pure conditions of the mind; 5. because\r\nthey are subject to cosmical and telluric states; 6. because their\r\ncrises always take place in a material way; 7. because they are not\r\ninfrequently removed by strong material influences; 8. because the\r\nsomatic mode of cure alone has a direct sanatory effect, the psychical\r\nat most an indirect effect on the body; 9. because the occurrence of\r\npsychical indisposition on one side only, must arise from the duality\r\nof the brain; 10. because the return of reason before death occurs in\r\ncases not only of psychical, but likewise of somatic diseases, and may\r\nbe physically accounted for; 11. because mental disorders correspond\r\nwith the temperaments; 12. because it may be proved that there are\r\npsychical conditions which depend on organic causes, and are therefore\r\nvery analogous to psychical disorders; 13. because chronic delirium\r\n(mania) can be no other than febrile.\" Absurd as such discussions may\r\nseem at this time, they are no worse than the theological debates\r\nof that day. As a matter of fact, they were no more futile than the\r\nefforts still being made to classify the various psychoses on some one\r\ncommon ground, for any other than purely statistical purposes.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[265] divides the psychoses due to infection into febrile\r\ndelirium, infection delirium, acute confusional states (amentia) and\r\nexhaustions. The result of the infectious process, as he says, may be\r\nmerely to precipitate a manic-depressive psychosis, or an attack of\r\ndementia praecox, general paresis or delirium tremens. It may also\r\nbe manifested in the form of a neuritis, myelitis, encephalitis, or a\r\nmeningitis. Bonhöffer in 1910 described several forms of \"symptomatic\r\npsychoses\" due to infections and divided them into three main groups:\r\ndeliria, confusions and mental enfeeblements. He also referred to\r\nepileptiform excitements, dream states, hallucinoses, manic types and\r\namentias either hallucinatory, catatonic or incoherent in character.\r\n\r\nKraepelin speaks of several definite stages or forms of febrile\r\ndelirium. In the mildest of these there is a feeling of discomfort\r\nwith a sensation of fulness in the head and a marked sensitiveness to\r\nexternal impressions. In the second stage a suggestion of clouding\r\nbecomes apparent and perception is distorted by hallucinations and\r\nillusions. There is an increased activity of the mental processes\r\nand consciousness soon assumes a dreamlike form. Hallucinations and\r\nillusions are mixed with realities. The restlessness increases and\r\nexcitements or depressive moods may precede the appearance of the third\r\nstage. In this there is a more pronounced disturbance of consciousness\r\nwith disorientation, confusion, flight of ideas, and variable emotional\r\nreactions, sometimes with actual manic manifestations. Evidences of\r\nstuporous tendencies may appear at times. In the fourth stage a state\r\nof weakness develops, with picking at the bed clothes, tremulous\r\nmovements and a senseless muttering of words and syllables. This\r\nterminates in complete coma. In smallpox, scarlet fever, erysipelas,\r\narticular rheumatism and pneumonia there are often sudden confused\r\nexcited states, while in typhoid fever stuporous delirium is the\r\nrule. Hendriks found the mental symptoms in typhoid greater during\r\nconvalescence and not closely related to the febrile reaction. He\r\ndescribes a marked disturbance of attention with little involvement\r\nof apprehension or comprehension, but marked loss of mental capacity\r\nand sometimes a tendency to confabulation. Visual hallucinations\r\nand loss of sleep are common symptoms. Often there is restlessness,\r\ntalkativeness, indifference, carelessness and disturbances of\r\nvolition. In articular rheumatism and scarlet fever, according to\r\nKraepelin, delirium sometimes develops with sudden rise of temperature.\r\nRestlessness, talking in the sleep, volubility or dulness precede an\r\nunusually violent delirium, sometimes terminating in stupor and death.\r\nThe basis of these conditions in all cases is the toxic infection\r\ncausing the fever, changes in metabolism, circulatory disturbances\r\nand an involvement of various organs, particularly the brain. A rapid\r\nand considerable rise of temperature usually causes delirium in\r\ntyphoid, smallpox and erysipelas while it has no such effect usually\r\nin tuberculosis. This disturbance is a direct result of the influence\r\nof the toxins on the cortex. Alcoholism constitutes another well-known\r\nand common cause. In seventy per cent of the cases the duration was\r\nless than one week and the delirium disappeared with the fall in\r\ntemperature. Some cases terminate in infection delirium or they may\r\nprecipitate genuine attacks of manic-depressive insanity, dementia\r\npraecox or general paresis.\r\n\r\nThe so-called acute alteration of Nissl was a very common change found\r\nin the cortical cells at autopsy. This very generally involved the\r\nentire cortex. Kraepelin describes another characteristic alteration\r\nobserved in cases of typhoid delirium. The Nissl bodies are clumped\r\ntogether in the periphery, and are deeply stained, the processes also\r\nbeing unusually dark. Some cells show a shrunken nucleus with swollen,\r\nlightly stained bodies. Around these neurones there are usually large\r\naccumulations of elongated glia cells.\r\n\r\nIn the infection delirium, so called, the mental disturbance develops\r\nin a case where there is no hyperpyrexia or where at least there is\r\nno relation between the psychosis and the temperature. A restless\r\nexcitement ushers in the attack. Pressure in the head, mental\r\ndulness, depressed or sometimes cheerful moods, uneasiness, disturbed\r\nsleep and anxious dreams are common symptoms. Later a disturbance of\r\nconsciousness appears and a special type known as \"initial delirium\"\r\nmay develop. This is a common occurrence in typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nAschaffenburg described two forms of initial delirium. The first is a\r\nrestless condition of clouding with hallucinations and delusions. The\r\nsecond form, which may develop from the first, shows active mental\r\nexcitement. Mild in its onset, a confusional delirious state soon\r\ndevelops with flight of ideas, hallucinations, delusions, and marked\r\nanxiety. An initial delirium of this type often occurs in smallpox.\r\nThis assumes a particularly severe form with a tendency to suicide\r\nand violence, strongly resembling epileptic dream states. Seizures\r\nand epileptiform convulsions may occur. The delirium usually develops\r\nfrom the third to the fifth day of the disease and mental enfeeblement\r\nsometimes follows. The attack usually lasts from several days to a\r\nweek. It may continue as a fever delirium. About forty or fifty per\r\ncent die. Nissl in one case found a marked congestion of the vessels\r\nof the cortex, with an increase in the number of leucocytes, and a\r\nwidespread destruction of the neurones. The cell bodies were swollen\r\nand the chromatin lumps destroyed. Karyokinetic changes were noted in\r\nthe glia cells.\r\n\r\nMore or less similar delirious states occur in the course of\r\nintermittent malarial fevers. These usually take the form of a marked\r\nanxious excitement, often with stupor or a tendency to violence.\r\nThe attacks begin suddenly, last only a few hours and end in\r\nsleep. Convulsions are frequently observed. These conditions occur\r\nin the quotidian or tertian types but rarely in the quartan. The\r\ndelirium precedes a febrile disturbance or may take its place. It\r\nis apparently due to an accumulation of plasmodia in the cerebral\r\nvessels. In influenza, restlessness, confusion, anxious excitement\r\nor hallucinatory deliria may be associated with a low temperature.\r\nPolyneuritic manifestations have also been observed. The disturbance\r\nis undoubtedly caused by the influenza bacillus or the action of its\r\ntoxins on the cortex. Abscesses are found in some instances. Deliria\r\nwith phthisis are rare unless there is a tubercular meningitis. In\r\nthe septic infections, conditions with marked clouding are often\r\nobserved, and are to be attributed to embolism, metastases, etc.\r\nMuscular weakness, aphasia, perseveration and convulsions may be\r\npresent in these cases. Infection delirium also occurs in chorea.\r\nThis takes the form of a clouded dreamlike state with confusion of\r\nthought at times, hallucinations, delusions, and emotional excitement\r\naccompanied by characteristic choreiform movements. Apprehension, as a\r\nrule, is unimpaired, but attention is disturbed and the patients are\r\nforgetful and distractible. They do not have a clear grasp on their\r\nsurroundings. Occasional hallucinations appear. The mood is anxious,\r\nexcited, fearful or irritable, sometimes with outbursts of anger or\r\nthreats of suicide. The choreiform attacks are aggravated and speech is\r\naffected. The reflexes are decreased and muscular weakness develops.\r\nThe pupils are dilated and sleep is interfered with to a marked degree.\r\nThis excitement lasts for a short time only, but often recurs. In nine\r\nper cent of the cases (Kleist) death results from heart failure, septic\r\ninfection or other intercurrent diseases. Wassermann and Westphal\r\ndemonstrated streptococci in the brain in several cases of chorea.\r\nOthers have reported staphylococci in the blood. Choreic delirium is\r\nusually associated with endocarditis or rheumatic infections, and\r\noccurs in the acute type but not in the Huntington variety of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nDelirious excitements, according to Kraepelin, also occur in acute\r\ncerebrospinal inflammatory processes and may be due to furunculosis\r\nor caused by infections from the mouth or the intestinal _tract_.\r\nThere is nothing particularly characteristic in such conditions aside\r\nfrom their severity. They have been collectively described under the\r\ndesignation of \"acute delirium.\" Their differentiation depends entirely\r\non the demonstration of the source of infection. The anatomical basis\r\nfor these disturbances is always found in the cerebral cortex. The pia\r\nis infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells and leucocytes are\r\nfound in the perivascular spaces. There is also a proliferation of the\r\nglia. The \"grave\" alteration of Nissl is often demonstrable. After\r\nthe infectious process passes its maximum intensity and the delirium\r\ndisappears, \"residual\" delusions may remain with a clear sensorium.\r\nThese may last for several days or even weeks. They frequently follow\r\ntyphoid fever. Occasionally hallucinations of sight and hearing persist\r\nin the same way.\r\n\r\n\"Collapse delirium\" was first described by Hermann Weber in 1866. It\r\ntakes the form of a stuporous state with confusion of thought, dreamy\r\nhallucinations, flight of ideas, an unstable emotional condition and\r\nan active motor excitement. The onset is usually sudden, following a\r\nperiod of sleeplessness and restlessness. Disorientation occurs early\r\nand consciousness is markedly clouded. Phantastic hallucinations and\r\nillusions are frequent. Excitement and confusion are also prominent\r\nsymptoms. Flight of ideas is common and the patient often sings or\r\nexpresses himself exclusively in verse or rhymes. Senseless and rapidly\r\nchanging delusions are noted. The mood is elated, erotic, anxious or\r\nirritable, with outbursts of anger. Motor excitement is conspicuous\r\nand there is no sleep. Usually food is refused and nutrition disturbed\r\nwith a great reduction of bodily weight. This condition is of short\r\nduration, usually not more than a few days, often terminating in sleep\r\nin favorable cases. Only a confused recollection of events remains\r\non recovery. Collapse delirium, according to Kraepelin, is purely\r\nan infectious process and often occurs in pneumonia, erysipelas and\r\ninfluenza, following the subsidence of the active symptoms of the\r\ndisease. It occasionally complicates articular rheumatism and scarlet\r\nfever. The characteristic features in erysipelas are hallucinations\r\nand delusions of a delirious type, while clouded states, confusional\r\nexcitements and flight of ideas are more common after pneumonia.\r\nThe symptoms usually develop after the temperature falls and other\r\nevidences of weakness are present. Kraepelin, however, recognizes\r\ninfection as the only cause at this time, although he previously\r\ndescribed these as exhaustive conditions.\r\n\r\nAcute confusional states or amentia were described by Meynert in 1881.\r\nThese are characterized by a clouding of consciousness with multiform\r\nmanifestations of excitement both sensory and motor. Amentia is one of\r\nthe sequelae of infectious diseases. It takes the form of a subacute\r\ndevelopment of a dreamlike confusion with hallucinations, illusions and\r\nmotor excitement lasting usually for several months. It is very closely\r\nrelated to collapse delirium and the hallucinatory insanity of Hoche,\r\nFürstner and others. The early symptoms are sleeplessness and unrest.\r\nThe patients become anxious, forgetful, develop a fear of death, and\r\ncannot control their thoughts, complaining of dulness and confusion\r\nof mind. A difficult comprehension of external impressions develops.\r\nThey may be attentive and seriously troubled at not being able properly\r\nto grasp their surroundings. A decided uncertainty and restlessness\r\nresults. Everything seems changed or false. There is at first a feeling\r\nof inadequacy and a profound disturbance of thought which develops\r\ninto a well defined confusional condition. A dreamlike state follows,\r\nsometimes with a tendency to fabrications. Rhymes, phrases and words\r\nmay be repeated frequently. There is a tendency towards distractibility\r\nand flight of ideas with vague thoughts of persecution. Hallucinations\r\nsometimes become apparent, and illusions appear. The mood is usually\r\none of irritable anxiety, suspicion and mistrust, seldom with complete\r\ndulness. Occasional outbursts of anger take place. A restless behavior\r\nis noted as a rule. Sometimes suicidal tendencies occur and mild\r\nstuporous states follow.\r\n\r\nIn another group of cases depression is an especially prominent\r\nfeature as occasionally happens after typhoid fever; or states of\r\nexcitement may exist with a flight of ideas and delusions of grandeur.\r\nBefore the febrile disturbance has disappeared signs of restlessness\r\nare noted. Orientation is soon lost, apprehension is disturbed, the\r\npatient becomes distractible and begins to show hallucinations. Ideas\r\nof grandeur develop and fabrications are conspicuous and extravagant.\r\nThe mood is angry and irritable, sometimes cheerful or elated, but\r\nvery changeable. Restlessness, volubility, flight of ideas, senseless\r\nrhyming, confused writing and tendencies to sing, etc., soon appear.\r\nThe sleep is very much disturbed. Very little nourishment is taken or\r\nit is refused entirely. Bodily weight is greatly reduced. The reflexes\r\nare usually increased, the pulse slow and the temperature subnormal.\r\nThe duration of the disease is usually not more than from two to\r\nsix months. Amentia usually follows typhoid, articular rheumatism,\r\nsmallpox and cholera, and occasionally occurs after pneumonia. Symptoms\r\ninvariably develop after the fever has subsided. After typhoid the\r\ncharacteristic features are excitement with hallucinations, delusions\r\nand variable moods; after articular rheumatism, disturbance of\r\napprehension, restlessness, depression or even stupor; and after\r\nphthisis, hallucinations with preservation of consciousness and slight\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nLight forms of the infectious exhaustions, according to Kraepelin, may\r\nappear after convalescence from the more severe illnesses. The patient\r\ndoes not make a good recovery, is exhausted, cannot think clearly,\r\ntires easily and is not able to read or write letters. Mental activity\r\nis weakened and the patient remains in bed, apathetic and indifferent.\r\nConsciousness, orientation and perception are undisturbed, although\r\nhallucinations may appear when the eyes are closed or noises in the\r\nears may be noticed. The mood is gloomy, hopeless, and sometimes\r\nirritable, with sudden attacks of anxiety at night. The patient becomes\r\nsuspicious and has fears of death or poisoning. Hypochondriacal\r\nfeelings with self-accusation may develop. Food may be refused and\r\nsuicidal attempts occur. Some cases are reserved and quiet, even\r\nstuporous, expressing only a few delusional ideas at times. Sleep and\r\nappetite are affected and weight lost as a consequence. These lighter\r\nforms usually follow influenza, articular rheumatism, whooping cough,\r\ntuberculosis or chorea. The duration is ordinarily brief—a few weeks\r\nor months, followed by recovery. In some instances the disease may\r\nprogress to a complete enfeeblement of the mental processes.\r\n\r\nThe exhaustive conditions in a large group of more severe cases are\r\nushered in by a delirium or confusional state with a depressed mood.\r\nThere is first a slight anxiety. Self-accusation and persecutory\r\nideas appear early. Hallucinations of hearing and vision develop.\r\nThe patients soon become clouded, inattentive, show difficulty of\r\nthought and loss of memory, with mental dulness. All grasp upon their\r\nsurroundings is lost, they fail to recognize members of the family,\r\nand answer questions unintelligently. They have no appreciation of\r\ntheir condition and no memory for events. The mood is indifferent,\r\napathetic or whining. It may be irritable, quarrelsome or violent.\r\nUsually they lie in bed and are entirely apathetic. Sometimes they\r\nshow automatic movements and have to be fed. The conversation is\r\noften incoherent and meaningless. They are inclined to be emotional.\r\nSleep is usually interfered with and they are restless at night. The\r\nappetite is lost. Occasionally evidences of brain lesions appear with\r\nparalyses, speech disturbance or epileptiform seizures. The duration\r\nis usually a matter of a number of months. At autopsy grave cell\r\nalterations and glia reactions are common. Rod cells are also found.\r\nEndothelial proliferation is frequently observed in the vessel walls.\r\nSome cases terminate in a chronic condition which may improve somewhat\r\nin time. There may be a persistent emotional and mental enfeeblement\r\nwith indifference, loss of memory, lack of judgment and impairment\r\nof will. These \"acute dementias\" represent the terminal stages of\r\ncortical infectious processes. They have been observed after typhoid,\r\nrheumatism, erysipelas, cholera, smallpox and malaria. Usually after\r\ntubercular peritonitis or articular rheumatism there is a simple\r\nmental enfeeblement, while erysipelas is usually accompanied by mild\r\nexcitements and an elated mood. The typhoid cases usually showed\r\nirritability, with outbursts of anger and confusional states with\r\nhallucinations and delusions. They occasionally terminate in more\r\nchronic conditions with permanent deterioration.\r\n\r\nAfter typhoid, influenza and septic infections, Korsakow's\r\n\"cerebropathica psychica toxaemica\" sometimes occurs. This is the\r\npolyneuritic psychosis similar to that caused by alcohol. There is,\r\nhowever, a delirium or stupor at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe post-rheumatic psychoses have been studied exhaustively by\r\nKnauer.[266] Stuporous attacks were found in ninety-three per cent of his\r\ncases, following acute infections. He describes four groups showing\r\npsychotic manifestations:—\r\n\r\n  1. Anxious delirious excitements followed by stupor.\r\n  2. Excitements alternating with stupor.\r\n  3. Stuporous depression throughout.\r\n  4. Amentia-like excitements throughout.\r\n\r\nThe essential feature of Knauer's study was an analysis of\r\npost-rheumatic stupors. He describes these as clouded or dream\r\nstates \"not different from physiological sleep and the ordinary\r\nartificial narcoses.\" In them he sees a disturbance of apprehension,\r\nan interference with intellectual processes, a retention defect, and a\r\nloss of the power of attention. Catalepsy was found to be present in\r\nthe majority of his cases. The loss of affect was described as being\r\nmore complete than in manic-depressive psychoses. He speaks of the mood\r\nas sad, depressed, anxious, but above all, changeable.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking this group of psychoses due to somatic disease\r\nis one which requires further study. We have comparatively little\r\nstatistical information on the subject as yet. The differentiation of\r\nthese conditions as outlined in the Association's statistical manual is\r\nas follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Under this heading are brought together those mental disorders which\r\nappear to depend directly upon some physical disturbance or somatic\r\ndisease not already provided for in the foregoing groups.\r\n\r\n\"In the types designated below under (a) to (e) inclusive, we have\r\nessentially deliria or states of confusion arising during the course\r\nof an infectious disease or in association with a condition of\r\nexhaustion or a toxaemia. The mental disturbance is apparently the\r\nresult of interference with brain nutrition or the unfavorable action\r\nof certain deleterious substances, poisons or toxins, on the central\r\nnervous system. The clinical pictures met with are extremely varied.\r\nThe delirium may be marked by severe motor excitement and incoherence\r\nof utterance, or by multiform hallucinations with deep confusion or\r\na dazed, bewildered condition; epileptiform attacks, catatonic-like\r\nsymptoms, stupor, etc., may occur. In classifying these psychoses\r\na difficult problem arises in many cases if attempts are made to\r\ndistinguish between infection and exhaustion as etiological factors.\r\nFor statistical reports the following differentiations should be made:\r\n\r\n\"Under (a) 'Delirium with infectious diseases' place the _initial\r\ndeliria_ which develop during the prodromal or incubation period or\r\nbefore the febrile stage as in some cases of typhoid, small-pox,\r\nmalaria, etc.; the _febrile deliria_ which seem to bear a definite\r\nrelation to the rise in temperature; the _post-febrile deliria_ of the\r\nperiod of defervescence including the so-called 'collapse delirium.'\r\n\r\n\"Under (b) 'Post-infectious psychoses' are to be grouped deliria,\r\nthe mild forms of mental confusion, or the depressive, irritable,\r\nsuspicious reactions which occur during the period of convalescence\r\nfrom infectious diseases. Physical asthenia and prostration are\r\nundoubtedly important factors in these conditions and differentiation\r\nfrom 'exhaustion deliria' must depend chiefly on the history and\r\nobvious close relationship to the preceding infectious disease. (Some\r\ncases which fail to recover show a peculiar mental enfeeblement.) In\r\nthis group should be classed the 'cerebropathica psychica toxaemica'\r\nor the non-alcoholic polyneuritic psychoses following an infectious\r\ndisease as typhoid, influenza, septicaemia, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Under (c) 'Exhaustion deliria' are to be classed psychoses in which\r\nphysical exhaustion, not associated with or the result of an infectious\r\ndisease, is the chief precipitating cause of the mental disorder,\r\n_e.g._, hemorrhage, severe physical over-exertion, deprivation of food,\r\nprolonged insomnia, debility from wasting disease, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Of the psychoses which occur with diseases of the ductless glands, the\r\nbest known are the thyroigenous mental disorders. Disturbance of the\r\npituitary or of the adrenal function is often associated with mental\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n\"According to the etiology and symptoms the following types should\r\ntherefore be specified under 'Psychoses with Other Somatic Diseases':\r\n\r\n  \"(a) Delirium with infectious disease (specify)\r\n  \"(b) Post-infectious psychosis (specify)\r\n  \"(c) Exhaustion delirium\r\n  \"(d) Delirium of unknown origin\r\n  \"(e) Cardio-renal disease\r\n  \"(f) Diseases of the ductless glands (specify)\r\n  \"(g) Other diseases or conditions (to be specified).\"\r\n\r\nA study of 480 cases of psychoses with other somatic diseases reported\r\nfrom the New York state hospitals during 1918 and 1919 shows the\r\nfollowing types represented:—\r\n\r\n                                       _Number_  _Percentage_\r\n  Delirium with infectious diseases       68        14.16\r\n  Post-infectious psychoses              102        21.25\r\n  Exhaustion delirium                     94        19.58\r\n  Delirium of unknown origin              36         7.50\r\n  Cardio-renal diseases                   69        14.37\r\n  Diseases of the ductless glands         20         4.16\r\n  Other conditions                        91        18.90\r\n\r\nAn analysis of 140 cases from the Massachusetts state hospitals in 1919\r\nshows the following:—\r\n\r\n                                       _Number_  _Percentage_\r\n  Delirium with infectious diseases       48        34.28\r\n  Post-infectious psychoses               25        17.85\r\n  Exhaustion delirium                     26        18.57\r\n  Delirium of unknown origin               6         4.28\r\n  Cardio-renal diseases                   16        11.42\r\n  Diseases of the ductless glands          1          .71\r\n  Other conditions                        18        12.85\r\n\r\nThree hundred and sixteen cases from hospitals in nineteen other states\r\nwere reported as follows:—\r\n\r\n                                       _Number_  _Percentage_\r\n  Delirium with infectious diseases       69        21.83\r\n  Post-infectious psychoses               30         9.49\r\n  Exhaustion delirium                     75        23.73\r\n  Delirium of unknown origin              33        10.44\r\n  Cardio-renal diseases                   45        14.24\r\n  Diseases of the ductless glands         15         4.74\r\n  Other conditions                        49        15.50\r\n\r\nWe have, thus, a total of 936 cases distributed as follows:—Delirium\r\nwith infectious diseases, 19.76 per cent; post-infectious psychoses,\r\n16.77; exhaustion delirium, 20.83; delirium of unknown origin, 8.01;\r\ncardio-renal diseases, 13.88; diseases of the ductless glands, 3.84;\r\nand other conditions, 16.88 per cent. Four and one hundredth per cent\r\nof the first admissions in Massachusetts, 3.45 per cent of the New\r\nYork admissions, and 2.07 per cent of admissions to twenty-one other\r\ninstitutions during the same period of time were cases of psychoses due\r\nto other somatic diseases. They constituted 2.81 per cent of 34,935\r\nadmissions to all of the institutions above noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE MANIC-DEPRESSIVE PSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manic-depressive psychoses as first described by Kraepelin are\r\nof comparatively recent origin. The history of the clinical entities\r\nincluded in this new grouping, however, may be easily traced back to\r\nthe earliest days of psychiatry. Although these terms were not used\r\nperhaps as they came to be later, mania and melancholia were, as has\r\nalready been shown, known in the Hippocratic era, over four hundred\r\nyears before the time of Christ. They were referred to again in the\r\nworks of Aretaeus in the first century A. D. and were recognized by\r\nCelsus, Caelius Aurelianus and Galen. Daniel Sennert[267] of Wittenberg\r\n(1572-1637) defined melancholia as a \"delirium or deprival of\r\nimagination and reason, without fever, with fear and sadness, arising\r\nfrom dark and melancholy animal spirits, and occasioning corresponding\r\nphantoms.\" Mania he described as a \"delirium or deprival of imagination\r\nand reason without fear, but, on the contrary, with audacity, temerity,\r\nanger, and ferocity, without fever, arising from a fervent and fiery\r\ndisposition.\"\r\n\r\nSydenham[268] recommended bleeding, followed by purgation, as the\r\ntreatment indicated for mania:—\"Thus the humours, which in mania would\r\ninvade the citadel of the brain, are gradually drawn off towards the\r\nlower parts, a fresh bias being given to them.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Willis[269] made some very significant references to the\r\nrelation existing between mania and melancholia, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury:—\"After melancholia we have to treat of mania, which has so\r\nmany relations to the former, that the two disorders often follow\r\neach other, the former changing into the latter, and inversely. The\r\nmelancholic diathesis, indeed, carried to its highest degree, causes\r\nfrenzy, and frenzy subsiding changes frequently into melancholia\r\n(atrabiliar diathesis). These two disorders, like fire and smoke, often\r\nmask and replace each other, and if we may say that in melancholia\r\nthe brain and the animal spirit are obscured by smoke and black\r\ndarkness, mania may be compared to a great fire destined to disperse\r\nand to illuminate it.\" Morgagni,[270] \"the father of pathology,\" also\r\nsaw a close relation between these two conditions as is shown by the\r\nfollowing quotation from his \"De Sedibus et Causis Morborum;\" etc.,\r\nin 1761. \"Melancholia,\" he says, \"is so nearly allied to mania, that\r\nthe diseases frequently alternate, and pass into one another; so that\r\nyou frequently see physicians in doubt whether they should call a\r\npatient a melancholiac or a maniac, taciturnity and fear alternating\r\nwith audacity in the same patient; on which account, when I have\r\nasked under what kind of delirium the insane persons have laboured\r\nwhose heads I was about to dissect, I have had the more patience\r\nin receiving answers which were frequently ambiguous and sometimes\r\nantagonistic to each other, yet, which were, perhaps, true in the long\r\ncourse of the insanity.\" Flemming[271] in 1844 described a \"dysthymia\r\natra\" (melancholia), a \"dysthymia candida\" (cheerful dysthymia) or\r\n\"melancholia hilaris\" characterized by elation with playfulness and a\r\n\"tendency to see everything in the most pleasant and cheerful light\" as\r\nwell as a \"dysthymia mutabilis,\" an alternating variety involving both\r\nof the above forms. He also spoke of a \"dysthymia sparsa\" (apathica)\r\nor \"melancholia attonita,\" and a \"vesania maniaca\" or mania which\r\nhe divided into the acute, delirious, alcoholic, affective, and\r\npuerperal types, together with an \"occult amentia\" embracing all of\r\nthese forms. Griesinger[272] in 1845 called attention to the fact\r\nthat \"the transition of melancholia into mania, and the alternation\r\nof these two forms, are very common.\" In 1851 Falret, senior, first\r\ndescribed circular insanity in his lectures at the Salpêtrière, quoted\r\nby Tuke[273] as follows:—\"We have also to mention another case of\r\nintermittence observed between the periods of remission and excitement\r\nin the forme circulaire des maladies mentales.\" \"It is a special\r\nform which we call 'circular' and which consists, not as has been\r\nfrequently said, in a change of mania into melancholia separated by a\r\nmore or less prolonged lucid interval, but in the change from maniacal\r\nexcitement—simple overactivity of all the faculties—into mental\r\ntorpor.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1854 at the Academy of Medicine in Paris Falret presented his\r\n\"Mémoire sur la folie circulaire, forme de maladie mentale caractérisée\r\npar la reproduction successive et régulière de l'état maniaque, de\r\nl'état mélancolique, et d'un intervalle lucide plus ou moins prolongé.\"\r\nIn the same year Baillarger described his \"Folie à double forme,\"\r\nsummarized by him in a Bulletin of the Academy of Medicine as follows:—\r\n\r\n \"(1) Besides monomania, melancholia, and mania, there exists a\r\n    special form of insanity characterized by two regular periods, one of\r\n    depression, the other of excitement.\r\n (2) This form of insanity: (1) presents itself in isolated attacks;\r\n    (2) reproduces itself in intermissions; (3) the attacks may follow\r\n    each other without interruption.\r\n (3) The duration of the attacks varies from two days to one year.\r\n (4) When the attacks are short, the transition from the first to the\r\n    second period takes place suddenly, and generally during sleep. It\r\n    takes place slowly and gradually when the attacks are prolonged.\r\n (5) In the latter case, the patients seem to enter into a state of\r\n    convalescence at the end of the first period, but this return to\r\n    health is incomplete; after a fortnight, a month, six weeks or more,\r\n    the second period breaks out.\"\r\n\r\nThis was described as \"Folie à double phase\" by Bellod, \"Folie à formes\r\nalternés\" by Delaye, \"Délire à formes alternés\" by Legrand du Saulle,\r\n\"Die cyclische Psychose\" by Ludwig Kirn and \"Das circuläre Irresein\" by\r\nKrafft-Ebing.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the American Association in 1886 the classification\r\nof the British Medico-Psychological Association was adopted with the\r\nomission of moral insanity and the addition of toxic insanity. This\r\nincluded the following types of mania:—Recent, chronic, recurrent,\r\nà potu, puerperal and senile, and classified melancholia as recent,\r\nchronic, recurrent, puerperal and senile. In his \"Clinical Lectures\r\non Mental Disease\" Clouston in 1898 described eight varieties of\r\nmelancholia and six of mania, not including alternating forms. Kahlbaum\r\nin 1882, reverting apparently to the phraseology of Flemming, spoke\r\nof dysthymia, hyperthymia and mixed or circular forms—cyclothymia.\r\nMany of the conditions afterwards classified under dementia praecox he\r\ndescribed as \"vesania typica.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, based somewhat on the conceptions of\r\nGriesinger, states of mental excitement were generally characterized\r\nas mania and all depressions as melancholia. As has been shown, the\r\nview that there was some definite relation between these two conditions\r\nhad been gaining ground for many years and culminated in the \"circular\r\ninsanity\" concept. In the meanwhile over fifty varieties of mania and\r\nthirty forms of melancholia were described by various authors. Aside\r\nfrom an emotional exaltation and increased psychomotor activity, few\r\ndefinite characteristics were insisted upon in a consideration of\r\nmania. There was almost invariably a disturbance of sleep but always\r\nwith a sense of well-being and no feeling of exhaustion. The milder\r\ntype of the disease was often referred to as \"hypomania.\" In the more\r\nsevere forms varying grades of violence developed. There was at times\r\na clouding of the sensorium, a temporary appearance of hallucinations\r\nof sight and hearing, delusions of a persecutory or grandiose nature\r\nand incoherence of speech. Impulsive acts occasionally were noted\r\nduring the height of the excitement. These attacks were frequently\r\npreceded by brief periods of depression. Many cases made rather early\r\nrecoveries—others, however, were spoken of as having reached a\r\nchronic stage. Many terminated in dementia. These very often showed\r\nstereotypies, verbigeration, impulsive excitements, mannerisms and\r\nother symptoms now held to be characteristic of dementia praecox.\r\nMelancholia was looked upon as including all emotional depressions\r\nwith hallucinations and delusions as the prominent symptoms. The\r\nmental state was essentially one of sadness but with fear, agitation\r\nand anxiety appearing at times. There was, however, no attempt at any\r\ndifferentiation between psychomotor retardation with genuine depression\r\nand apathetic states or actual mental dulness. Mutism and resistiveness\r\nwere common. A refusal of food was rather to be expected. Stuporous\r\nstates with muscular rigidity frequently occurred. Various physical\r\nchanges were described. Cyanosis of the extremities was emphasized,\r\nwith loss of weight and a lowered temperature. Many of the cases\r\nwere untidy in their habits. Brief initial attacks of excitement\r\nwere mentioned as usually ushering in the disease. These depressions\r\nrecovered, became chronic, lasting for years, or terminated in a\r\npartial or complete dementia. These were in substance the views of\r\npractically all of the earlier writers on insanity.\r\n\r\nSankey[274] in 1884 included in his idiopathic psychoses due to\r\npathological conditions, general paresis and \"ordinary insanity.\" \"This\r\nis the disease which in its course presents such varying phenomena,\r\nand has thus given occasion for multiplying the names.\" Prominent\r\nin this group were the various forms of mania and melancholia and\r\nit undoubtedly included dementia praecox. \"Like other diseases it\r\nmay be artificially divided into separate stages, and this is useful\r\nfor facilitating description, but such artificial divisions must not\r\nbe looked upon as different species of disease.\" ... \"Thus, a case\r\nin the primary attack commences by symptoms of melancholy; these\r\nmay, when successfully treated, pass off, and the patient recover,\r\nor the melancholic stage may be aggravated, and the patient die in\r\nthis stage;—the disease may exhibit symptoms of violence and become\r\nacutely maniacal. There is no ground on this account to say, that the\r\npatient has a new disease, any more than the appearance of an eruption\r\nin an eruptive disease would be the inauguration of a different kind\r\nof malady.\" Although obviously he had no idea as to the fundamental\r\ndifferences between manic-depressive insanity and dementia praecox, he\r\nunquestionably was one of the first to emphasize the fact that mania\r\nand melancholia were often definite stages of one disease process.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Kraepelin described melancholia as essentially an involutional\r\ncondition. Under the heading of periodic constitutional disorders he\r\nincluded mania, circular and depressive forms, the mania, melancholia,\r\nand circular insanity of other writers. Schüle[275] in 1886 described\r\ncircular, periodical and alternating psychoses. In 1894 Ziehen[276]\r\nincluded in his classification under the heading of combined psychoses\r\na \"melancholisch-maniakalisches\" form in addition to mania and\r\nmelancholia, which he spoke of as affective psychoses.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1899 that these conditions were clearly differentiated\r\nby Kraepelin[277] and the purely emotional and recoverable forms\r\nseparated clinically from the deteriorative processes which he\r\nhas associated with dementia praecox. The former he described as\r\nmanic-depressive psychoses, which included mania, melancholia\r\nand a majority of the circular and alternating types previously\r\ndescribed. This delimitation had a prognostic as well as an important\r\nsymptomatic significance. The emotional excitements were characterized\r\nby an increased psychomotor activity, with a flight of ideas and\r\ndistractibility, usually associated with a clear sensorium. Graver\r\nforms were, however, recognized, with a clouding of consciousness, and\r\ndisorientation, occasionally terminating in stupor. Hallucinations and\r\ndelusions when present were not prominent symptoms. The depressions\r\nwere characterized by an emotional disturbance in the form of sadness\r\nwith difficulty in thinking, associated with marked retardation in\r\nspeech and a motor inhibition. More advanced stages showed clouding,\r\ndisorientation, stuporous phases and hallucinations. He also recognized\r\nalternating or circular as well as mixed types. The prognostic\r\nimportance of this clinical grouping was the tendency towards a\r\ncomplete recovery from the individual attack, with, however, an\r\nextreme probability later of a recurrence, the subsequent attacks\r\nassuming either form of the disease. As a rule Kraepelin found that the\r\nunfavorable types formerly included in the manias and melancholiac,\r\ntogether with the hebephrenia and katatonia of his fifth edition,\r\npresented the definite characteristics of the disease which he\r\ndescribed as dementia praecox. His views have been modified from time\r\nto time. For instance, he at one time excluded the involutional and\r\nanxiety psychoses from his manic-depressive group. Later these were\r\nincluded. In his last edition he has described depressed and agitated\r\nforms of dementia praecox, which would strongly suggest that his lines\r\nof demarcation were not so clear as he believed them to be in 1899. Of\r\nthe manic-depressive psychoses he says, \"Manic depressive insanity as\r\ndescribed in this chapter includes on the one hand the entire domain of\r\nthe so-called periodic and circular insanities, on the other, simple\r\nmania, the larger part of the disease process described as melancholia\r\nand also a not inconsiderable number of cases of Amentia. Finally\r\nwe include certain mild morbid emotional states, some periodical,\r\nsome continuous, which heretofore have been looked upon either as\r\nintroductory to more severe disturbances or as belonging, without being\r\nsharply circumscribed, to the domain of individual makeup. As years\r\ngo by I have become more and more convinced that these all represent\r\nmanifestations of one disease process.\" The following classification\r\nof manic-depressive psychoses was shown in Kraepelin's last edition\r\n(1913):—\r\n\r\n Manic types:\r\n   Hypomania, Acute mania, Delusional and Delirious forms.\r\n\r\n Depressive types:\r\n   Melancholia simplex, Melancholia gravis, Stupor, Paranoid, Phantastic\r\n and Delirious forms.\r\n\r\n Mixed types:\r\n   Depressive mania.\r\n   Excited depressions.\r\n   Mania with poverty of thought.\r\n   Manic stupor.\r\n   Depression with flight of ideas.\r\n   Retarded mania.\r\n\r\nThe mixed and atypical forms are of special importance, as they occupy\r\nthe middle ground between the classical types of manic-depressive\r\ninsanity and dementia praecox. It is here that difficulties arise and\r\nerrors in diagnosis are made. They have never received sufficient\r\nattention until recently. In practice many of these have undoubtedly\r\nbeen classed with the dementia praecox group. The first of these as\r\ndescribed by Kraepelin is depressive or anxious mania—characterized by\r\na depressive mood with anxiety and excitement and, at the same time, a\r\nflight of ideas. The patients are distractible, observant of everything\r\nin their surroundings, and complain that thoughts obtrude themselves\r\nupon them. Some have a mania for scribbling. Often there are delusions\r\nof persecution, sin, and hypochondriacal ideas. The mood is one of\r\nanxiety or despair. Impulsive acts are occasionally observed. They are\r\ninclined to weep, wring their hands, pull out their hair and throw\r\nthemselves on the ground.\r\n\r\nInstead of a flight of ideas there may be poverty of thought and\r\nretardation with excitement—an \"excited depression.\" The patients\r\nmay be very wordy and monotonous in expression but are entirely clear\r\nas to their surroundings. The mood is anxious and tearful, often with\r\ndelusions. There is a considerable excitement, but not of such a\r\nstormy character as in the depressive or anxious mania.\r\n\r\nMania with poverty of thought, an \"unproductive\" form, shows a more\r\ncheerful mood but without a flight of ideas. This form Kraepelin speaks\r\nof as a common one. Speech is monotonous and expressionless. The\r\npatients present almost an appearance of feeblemindedness, although\r\nexceedingly variable and changeable. The mood is cheerful and sometimes\r\nirritable. The excitement is shown by jumping around, making faces,\r\netc., but without any occupational activity. This alternates with\r\nperiods of quiet when but little is said. They show no desire to occupy\r\nthemselves in anything useful. Sudden outbursts of violence often occur.\r\n\r\nStuporous, almost cataleptic forms with occasional delusions of a\r\nhypochondriacal type, fairly well oriented and with a clear sensorium,\r\nare spoken of as \"manic stupor.\" This is interrupted by excitement and\r\nviolence, with laughter, witty remarks and even eroticism. They often\r\nhave a clear memory of all occurrences. This stuporous type may appear\r\nsuddenly in an ordinary manic attack, or take place between excitements\r\nand depressions.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an ordinary depression a flight of ideas may also\r\nreplace the usual retardation—\"depression with flight of ideas.\" The\r\ndelusions are interspersed with cheerful thoughts and the patients show\r\ncertain activities and an interest in their surroundings, although\r\nstill depressed and hopeless. When they begin to talk they complain\r\nof an inability to control their thoughts. There is an inhibition of\r\nspeech but not of thought. They may be quite prolific in writing, and\r\nmay show a characteristic flight of ideas. This condition often merges\r\ninto genuine excitement.\r\n\r\nKraepelin also speaks of an inhibited or \"retarded mania,\" showing\r\na cheerful mood with flight of ideas and psychomotor retardation.\r\nThese eases are excited, distractible, inclined to witticisms with\r\n\"klang associations,\" but lie quietly in bed. He believes that there\r\nis an inner tension manifesting itself at times in acts of violence.\r\nKraepelin also speaks of various other mixtures of depression,\r\nanxiety and excitement. Specht has described an \"irascible mania\"\r\n(Zorntobsucht) and Stransky a bashful mania (verschämte Manie). Dreyfus\r\nhas described a partial inhibition or retardation (partiellen Hemmung).\r\nHecker is responsible for a \"grumbling\" or faultfinding variety\r\nof mania (nörgelnden Formen der Manie). In any event, Kraepelin's\r\nconceptions constitute a distinct advance and have materially clarified\r\na much involved confusion of entities which seem to warrant complete\r\ndifferentiation. His views have, of course, not been universally\r\naccepted. The English school of psychiatrists has been slow in\r\nexpressing its approval of his theories. No textbook of late years\r\nhas appeared, however, in this country that has failed to recognize\r\nthe manic-depressive psychoses practically as Kraepelin originally\r\ndescribed them.\r\n\r\nThe psychological mechanisms of manic-depressive insanity have been\r\nstudied exhaustively by Karl Abraham and other psychoanalysts. He\r\nlooks upon retardation as a symbol of death and interprets it as a\r\ndefensive reaction, the patient taking refuge in a retarded state to\r\navoid contact with the outer world. The ideas of poverty associated\r\nwith depressions he considered as symbolic of an inability to love and\r\noccurring in individuals who have not obtained sexual gratification in\r\na normal way. When repression is no longer possible mania ensues and\r\nthe patient enters upon a new existence, all instinctive inhibition\r\nbeing lost. The flight of ideas he looks upon as a reestablishment\r\nof infantilism. He suggests these views, however, as tentative. The\r\ndelusions of the manic-depressive psychoses have been interpreted as\r\nan expression of repressed complexes. White[278] would explain these\r\nmechanisms as follows:—\"Manic-depressive psychosis is the type of\r\nextroversion reaction. That is, the patients instead of turning within\r\nthemselves (introversion) try to escape their difficulties (conflict)\r\nby a 'flight into reality.' This flight into reality is the manic\r\nphase of the psychosis with its flight of ideas, distractibility and\r\nincreased psychomotor activity during which the patient seems to be\r\nat the mercy almost of his environment having his attention diverted\r\nby every passing stimulus. The great activity can be understood as\r\na defense mechanism. The patient appears, by his constant activity\r\nto be covering every possible avenue of approach which might by any\r\npossibility touch his sore point (complex) and so he rushes wildly\r\nfrom this possible source of danger to that meanwhile keeping up a\r\nstream of diverting activities. He is at once running away from his\r\nconflict—into reality—and trying to adequately defend every possible\r\napproach.... This method I have described as a 'flight into reality'\r\nwhich is the characteristic of the manic phase, while the failure to\r\ndeal adequately with the difficulty is manifested by the depression\r\nof the depressive phase. In the depression the defenses have broken\r\ndown and the patient is overwhelmed by a sense of his moral turpitude\r\n(self-accusatory delusions). This sense of being sinful is the\r\nconscious appreciation of tendencies which should have been left behind\r\nto become a part of the historical past (the unconscious) in the course\r\nof the development of the psyche but which still demand expression....\r\nThe benign character of the manic-depressive group of psychoses is\r\nexplained because of their extroverted mechanism. Reality is the normal\r\ndirection for the libido and because the direction is normal they more\r\nreadily result in recovery.\"\r\n\r\nThe American Psychiatric Association, in its manual designed for\r\nthe assistance of hospitals for mental diseases in the compilation\r\nof statistical data, makes the following suggestions as to the\r\ndelimitation of the manic-depressive psychoses:—\r\n\r\n\"This group comprises the essentially benign affective psychoses,\r\nmental disorders which fundamentally are marked by emotional\r\noscillations and a tendency to recurrence. Various psychotic trends,\r\ndelusions, illusions and hallucinations, clouded states, stupor, etc.,\r\nmay be added. To be distinguished are:\r\n\r\n\"The _manic_ reaction with its feeling of well-being (or\r\nirascibility), flight of ideas and over-activity.\r\n\r\n\"The _depressive_ reaction with its feeling of mental and physical\r\ninsufficiency, a despondent, sad or hopeless mood and in severe\r\ndepressions, retardation and inhibition; in some cases the mood is one\r\nof uneasiness and anxiety, accompanied by restlessness.\r\n\r\n\"The _mixed_ reaction, a combination of manic and depressive symptoms.\r\n\r\n\"The _stupor_ reaction with its marked reduction in activity,\r\ndepression, ideas of death, and often dream-like hallucinations;\r\nsometimes mutism, drooling and muscular symptoms suggestive of the\r\ncatatonic manifestations of dementia praecox, from which, however,\r\nthese manic-depressive stupors are to be differentiated.\r\n\r\n\"An attack is called _circular_ when, as is often the case, one phase\r\nis followed immediately by another phase, e.g., a manic reaction\r\npasses over into a depressive reaction or vice versa.\r\n\r\n\"Cases formerly classed as allied to manic-depressive should be placed\r\nhere rather than in the undiagnosed group.\r\n\r\n\"In the statistical reports the following should be specified:—(a)\r\nManic type; (b) Depressive type; (c) Stuporous type; (d) Mixed\r\ntype; (e) Circular type; (f) Other types.\"\r\n\r\nDiefendorf[279] states that manic-depressive insanity comprises from\r\ntwelve to twenty per cent of the admissions to hospitals for mental\r\ndiseases. He reports defective heredity as being shown in from seventy\r\nto eighty per cent of the cases. He also found about seventy-five per\r\ncent of the patients suffering from this disease to be of the female\r\nsex. Buckley[280] states that sixty per cent of the cases give positive\r\nhistories of \"familial neuropathy and psychopathy.\" Paton[281] is of\r\nthe opinion that heredity is a factor in from eighty to ninety per\r\ncent of all cases. Hoch has called attention to the constitutional\r\nmakeup of individuals subject to manic-depressive attacks and suggests\r\nthat they are usually of a moody, morose type, unduly optimistic or\r\ntemperamentally unstable. Kraepelin[282] found suicidal tendencies in\r\n14.7 per cent of the female patients, and in 20.4 per cent of the men.\r\nNine per cent of his cases showed a manic makeup; 12.1 per cent, a\r\ndepressive temperament; 12.4 per cent were irascible or nervous; and\r\nfrom three to four per cent exhibited cyclothymic tendencies. Of the\r\ncases admitted to his clinic 48.9 per cent were depressive forms; 16.6\r\nper cent, manic; and 34.5 per cent represented both types in various\r\ncombinations. Melancholia simplex and gravis constituted 23.5 per cent\r\nof the simple forms, 13.5 per cent showed phantastic delusions and 6.1\r\nper cent anxieties. Hypomanias made up four per cent, and acute mania,\r\n9.8 per cent of the cases. Confused and stuporous states constituted\r\n8.2 per cent and compulsions, one per cent. Lighter forms constituted\r\nten per cent, and more severe types, nine per cent of the admissions.\r\nStupors and clouding were found in 4.9 per cent and delusional states\r\nin 4.9 per cent of the total. He quotes Walker as reporting, in a\r\nstudy of 674 cases, that excitements contributed eleven per cent;\r\ndepressions, 55.7 per cent; and circular forms 33.3 per cent of the\r\nmale cases; and excitements, 6.2 per cent; depressions, 70.2 per cent;\r\nand circular types, 23.6 per cent of the female admissions. In from\r\nsixty to seventy per cent of Kraepelin's cases the first attack was a\r\ndepression. In two-thirds of them, after the first mild attack there\r\nwas a remission. In one-third of the cases, the depression terminated\r\nin an excitement followed by recovery. When the disease begins with\r\na manic attack, two-thirds of the cases are followed by a remission.\r\nHe reports excitements with a duration of ten years and depressions\r\nof fourteen years standing. In a study of 703 remissions he found\r\nninety-six lasting from ten to nineteen years; thirty-four, from\r\ntwenty to twenty-nine years; eight, from thirty to thirty-nine years;\r\nand one of forty-four years. He is of the opinion that the length of\r\nremission bears no relation to the duration of the attack. Of the\r\ndepressions, 167 had a remission of six years; forty-six of 2.8 years;\r\nand twenty-seven of two years or more. Of the manic forms, fifty-three\r\nhad remissions of 3.3 years; twenty-four of 4.5 years; and twenty of\r\ntwo years or more. Manic-depressive psychoses constitute from ten to\r\nfifteen per cent of the admissions at Kraepelin's clinic. He found\r\nhereditary taint in eighty per cent of his Heidelberg cases and quotes\r\nWalker as reporting 73.4 per cent; Saiz 84.7 per cent; Weygandt, ninety\r\nper cent; and Albrecht, 80.6 per cent. A history of alcoholism was\r\nfound in twenty-five per cent and syphilis in eight per cent of the\r\nmale patients.\r\n\r\nRehm made an interesting study of the offspring of manic-depressives.\r\nOf forty-four children in nineteen families, fifty-two per cent showed\r\nevidences of psychic degenerations, twenty-nine per cent of which\r\nconsisted in an abnormal emotional makeup usually of the depressive\r\ntypes. In 157 cases from fifty-nine families, Bergamasco found that 109\r\nshowed manic-depressive psychoses. Kraepelin noted that the highest\r\npercentage of the first attacks occurred between the ages of fifteen\r\nand twenty. Reiss made a very significant analysis of the various\r\nforms of the disease manifested by individuals possessing definite\r\npredisposition. Thus, of the cases with a depressive makeup 64.2 per\r\ncent had depressive attacks, 8.3 per cent, manic, and 27.5 per cent,\r\ncombined forms. Of those with manic temperaments, 35.6 per cent had\r\ndepressive attacks, 23.3 per cent, manic, and 41.1 per cent, combined\r\nforms. Of the irritable individuals, 45.5 per cent had depressive\r\nattacks, 24.4 per cent, manic, and 30.1 per cent, combined forms. Of\r\nthe cyclothymic persons, 35.3 per cent had depressions, 11.7 per cent,\r\nexcitements, and fifty-three per cent, combined forms.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of the number of cases of manic-depressive insanity\r\nadmitted to American institutions is exceedingly interesting in\r\nview of the opinions expressed by Kraepelin. From 1912 to 1919\r\nthere were 49,640 first admissions to the thirteen New York state\r\nhospitals. Of these, 7,499, or 15.1 per cent, were diagnosed as having\r\nmanic-depressive psychoses or allied conditions. During the years\r\n1918 and 1919, when the Association's classification was officially\r\nused throughout, the percentage of manic-depressive psychoses was\r\n14.57. In the fourteen state hospitals of Massachusetts in 1919 there\r\nwere 3,011 first admissions. Two hundred and eighty-three, or 9.39\r\nper cent, of these were manic-depressive psychoses. In twenty-one\r\nstate hospitals in fourteen other states, practically all in 1917,\r\n1918 and 1919, there were 18,336 first admissions. Of these 3,409,\r\nor 18.59 per cent, were cases of manic-depressive insanity. Thus, of\r\nthe 70,987 first admissions reported from forty-eight hospitals in\r\nsixteen different states there were 11,191 cases of manic-depressive\r\ninsanity, a percentage of 15.76. This may probably be looked upon as\r\nfairly representative of the incidence of manic-depressive psychoses in\r\nAmerican institutions.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to an analysis of the various forms of manic-depressive\r\npsychoses reported, the indications are not so clear. In New York\r\nduring 1918 and 1919 there were 1,980 cases distributed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_       _Number_   _Percentage_\r\n  Manic          905        45.71\r\n  Depressive     729        36.82\r\n  Stuporous       53         2.68\r\n  Mixed          245        12.37\r\n  Circular        48         2.42\r\n\r\nDuring the eight-year period referred to above in the New York\r\nhospitals there were 6,091 cases of manic-depressive and allied\r\nconditions, classified as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_       _Number_   _Percentage_\r\n  Manic         2952        48.46\r\n  Depressive    2014        33.06\r\n  Stuporous       76         1.24\r\n  Mixed          773        12.69\r\n  Circular       199         3.26\r\n\r\nThe fourteen Massachusetts hospitals reported 672 cases in 1917 and\r\n1918, classified as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_       _Number_   _Percentage_\r\n  Manic          222        33.03\r\n  Depressive     373        55.50\r\n  Stuporous        4          .59\r\n  Mixed           66         9.82\r\n  Circular         7         1.04\r\n\r\nIn the twenty-one hospitals in fourteen other states there were 3,409\r\ncases of manic-depressive psychoses as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_       _Number_   _Percentage_\r\n  Manic         1401        41.09\r\n  Depressive    1365        46.04\r\n  Stuporous       62         1.82\r\n  Mixed          228         6.69\r\n  Circular        94         2.76\r\n\r\nThe total from all of these institutions, of 12,152 cases, was\r\nclassified as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_       _Number_   _Percentage_\r\n  Manic         5480        45.09\r\n  Depressive    4481        36.87\r\n  Stuporous      195         1.60\r\n  Mixed         1312        10.79\r\n  Circular       348         2.87\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that manic cases are more common than the depressive\r\nin New York, the number of the former being fifteen per cent greater\r\nthan the latter. In Massachusetts the number of depressive forms is\r\ntwenty-two per cent higher than the manic. In the other states the\r\ndepressive types are less than five per cent higher than the manic.\r\nIn all institutions the mixed forms are more common than the circular\r\nor stuporous. The stuporous forms constitute the smallest percentage\r\nreported in all hospitals, except in 1918 and 1919 in New York. We\r\nwould be warranted, apparently, in the conclusion that in this country\r\nmanic forms are the more common, the depressive being second in\r\nfrequency, followed by the circular and stuporous types in the order\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe statement is, I think, also warranted that there is a considerable\r\ndifference of opinion as to the classification of the different forms\r\nof manic-depressive insanity and that diagnostic procedure is far\r\nfrom being standardized. Many of these discrepancies are doubtless\r\ndue to difficulties in differentiating between certain cases of\r\nmanic-depressive psychoses and dementia praecox. The hospitals\r\nreporting lower percentages of the former usually show a much higher\r\nrate of the latter. Certainly there is room for an honest difference\r\nof opinion in many instances. It must be admitted, moreover, that our\r\nfundamental conceptions of these two great groups do not permit of a\r\nhard and fast line of demarcation between them in all cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nINVOLUTION MELANCHOLIA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Kraepelin first definitely outlined his views on dementia\r\npraecox, to which he assigned hebephrenia, although he did not at\r\nthe time include katatonia in his delimitation of that disease. He\r\nalso described melancholia in his fifth edition, classifying it as\r\nan involutional or retrograde presenile process (Das Irresein des\r\nRückbildungsalters). He had not as yet formulated his theory of the\r\nmanic-depressive psychoses although he described manic and depressive\r\nforms of periodical constitutional disorders. In 1899 he discarded the\r\nmania and melancholia of other writers altogether or rather included\r\nthem in his new manic-depressive group, but still retained melancholia\r\nas a distinct entity occurring in the involutional period of life only.\r\nAs has already been shown, melancholia is a term which had been used\r\nfor centuries and in a general way applied to depressions of any and\r\nall types. Kraepelin's manic-depressive psychoses and dementia praecox\r\nvery largely destroyed the integrity of this old-time conception. It\r\nhas been shown, furthermore, that depressive states often constitute\r\nan integral part of the picture of general paresis. Symptomatic\r\ndepressions more or less distinct in character have been associated\r\nwith a number of somatic diseases. Senile psychoses, epilepsy,\r\nvarious organic conditions, the psychoneuroses and the psychopathic\r\npersonalities have depressive manifestations well recognized and\r\nreadily classifiable.\r\n\r\nKraepelin, however, pointed out the fact that there was another group\r\nstill unaccounted for—the anxious depressions of later life, which\r\nhe included under the designation of involution melancholia and which\r\ndid not belong to the manic-depressive group. This he described as\r\nbeing preeminently a depression associated almost always with anxiety\r\nand fear as prominent symptoms. Accompanying this condition there\r\nare usually ideas of poverty, sin, or impending danger of some kind.\r\nDelusions of self-accusation are quite common. Anxious restlessness\r\nor agitated excitement is to be expected in a majority of the cases.\r\nThere is usually no clouding of the consciousness, although, as Hoch\r\nexpresses it, \"the mental horizon may be more or less narrowed to the\r\ndepressive ideas.\" The memory as a rule is not impaired. Hallucinations\r\nof sight and hearing are often present. Somatic delusions of a\r\nhypochondriacal nature occur. Insomnia is usually marked. The tendency\r\nof the disease is towards deterioration. Retardation and psychomotor\r\ninactivity are not to be expected. Melancholia is to be differentiated\r\nfrom manic-depressive insanity by the prominence of anxiety and\r\napprehension, the absence of any retardation or psychomotor inhibition,\r\nthe unusual frequency of self-accusation with ideas of sinfulness, the\r\nclearness of the sensorium, the comparatively unfavorable prognosis and\r\nthe great frequency of suicidal impulses. The age, and the absence of\r\nprevious attacks, is, of course, exceedingly important in arriving at\r\na diagnosis. The onset of the disease is usually between the ages of\r\nforty and sixty, but not infrequently it begins with the menopause in\r\nwomen, and Kraepelin states that sixty per cent of the cases occur in\r\nthe female sex. He found a history of defective heredity very common.\r\nThe precipitating factor is often some mental shock, the illness\r\nor death of friends, or disasters of various kinds. No distinctive\r\npathology of the disease has been described by Kraepelin. He was\r\nuncertain as to the rôle played by arteriosclerosis in its etiology.\r\nDiefendorf[283] reported that about one-third of the cases made complete\r\nrecoveries; twenty-three per cent were able to return to their previous\r\nsurroundings; twenty-six per cent terminated in an advanced state of\r\ndeterioration and nineteen per cent died within a period of two or\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Dreyfus,[284] at that time an assistant of Kraepelin's, made\r\nan elaborate study of the cases previously diagnosed as involution\r\nmelancholia in the Heidelberg clinic. During a period of fourteen\r\nyears, a total of seventy-nine were reported. A thorough investigation\r\nby Dreyfus showed that two-thirds of these had made complete recoveries\r\nor improved to such an extent as to be able to go home. Only eight per\r\ncent showed a marked mental deterioration. He also found that over\r\nhalf of the series had more than one attack, usually depressions.\r\nOne-third of the patients died and were thus eliminated from further\r\nconsideration. The duration of the attack was over three years in\r\none-third of the cases reviewed. Fifteen per cent recovered in from\r\nthree to five years, nine per cent in from six to eight years, and\r\neight per cent in from ten to fourteen years. He was of the opinion\r\nthat after a careful study of the hospital records the symptoms found\r\ncould all be explained on the basis of manic-depressive insanity,\r\nusually of a mixed form. Kraepelin had reported that forty-nine per\r\ncent of his cases deteriorated mentally. Dreyfus reduced this on\r\nfurther observation to only eight per cent. On analysis he found, in\r\nmany instances, brief periods of manic elation, sometimes only a matter\r\nof hours or a few days, evidences of excitability, manic suggestion in\r\nthe eagerness of the patient to communicate his troubles to others,\r\nand inhibitory processes indicated by a lack of interest, loss of\r\naffection or even difficulty of thinking. Dreyfus concluded that the\r\ndepressions of late years were not so common as had been supposed and\r\nthat a sufficient knowledge of their history showed that they had\r\nusually exhibited previous attacks. He thought that the long duration\r\nof the disease probably led to erroneous ideas as to its termination in\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nKirby[285] is of the opinion that Dreyfus based some of his findings on\r\ninsufficient evidence, as shown by his published case records:—\"In\r\na considerable number of other cases the author's conclusion that\r\nmanic-depressive symptoms were present is based on extremely meagre\r\ndata. As an illustration one case may be referred to briefly. A man\r\nfifty-three years old had an agitated depression lasting over two and\r\none-half years and terminating in recovery. The case record contains\r\nno statement of any objective inhibition or feeling of subjective\r\ninsufficiency, neither are there any statements regarding flight\r\nof ideas, or unusual loquacity. The diagnosis, however, is made of\r\nmanic-depressive insanity, with partial psychomotor inhibition and\r\nflight of ideas. The assumption that these symptoms existed is based\r\nentirely on the retrospective account from the patient, obtained three\r\nyears after recovery from the psychosis. He then declared that during\r\nthe attack he could not think calmly; it seemed that one thought\r\n\"knocked the other down,\" one thought \"hunted after the other.\" He also\r\ndescribed a feeling as if there were a cap on his head, as if he were\r\nnailed down. These retrospective statements are interpreted to mean\r\nthat there was partial psychomotor inhibition and flight of ideas. In\r\nmany other cases the reasoning is just as forced and the deductions\r\nbased on equally insufficient grounds.... The author's aim was to see\r\nif the symptoms present fitted into certain schematic formula and thus\r\nthe analysis became rather a search for diagnostic signs supposed to\r\ncharacterize a definite form of disease. Such a method leads away from\r\nconsideration of the mental disorder as a whole; a few minor features\r\nare emphasized in the picture and because the patient recovers these\r\nare raised to diagnostic importance—a little feeling of insufficiency\r\nor a slight change of mood in a disorder which ends in recovery are\r\nseized upon as evidence that a special kind of disease exists; as a\r\nmatter of fact, we would hardly miss just such symptoms in many other\r\npsychoses. There is no attempt to get below the surface, to understand\r\nthe evolution of the disorder, or to use the facts in the development\r\nin formulating the prognosis.\"\r\n\r\nIn the introduction to the book written by Dreyfus in 1907, Kraepelin\r\nnevertheless expressed the opinion that \"These results show that\r\nfor the most of these disorders which have been designated as\r\nmelancholia there now exists no sufficient reason to separate them\r\nfrom manic-depressive insanity.\" This at the time was looked upon as\r\ndefinitely settling the fate of the melancholia concept and it was\r\nabandoned by some. As a general rule, however, the psychiatrists of\r\nthis country seem to have accepted Kraepelin's original description\r\nof the disease as being thoroughly justified. To use White's words,\r\n\"Many psychiatrists still believe, although Kraepelin himself accepts\r\nDreyfus' conclusions, that there is still a place for involution\r\nmelancholia distinct from the manic-depressive group.\"\r\n\r\nIn his eighth edition Kraepelin[286] discusses melancholia as a\r\npresenile condition and reviews the whole situation in considerable\r\ndetail. He shows that symptomatic considerations alone did not guide\r\nhim in his original conception of the disease. A great deal of weight\r\nwas attached to prognosis and certain forms were separated out and\r\ndifferentiated from manic-depressive because they tended towards\r\nmental enfeeblement. He calls attention to the fact that Thalbitzer\r\ndisputed the integrity of melancholia in 1905, classifying it as a\r\nmanic-depressive reaction. After reviewing the findings of Dreyfus he\r\nadmits that the conclusions of the latter are in the main correct and\r\nthat involution melancholia as originally described cannot be retained\r\nas a definite entity. \"The significant fact still remains,\" he says,\r\n\"that single attacks of depression are disproportionately common in\r\nthe involution period.\" Hübner, for instance, found twenty-one single\r\nattacks of melancholia after the fiftieth year of age to only two\r\nsingle attacks of mania. \"The appearance of depressions, therefore,\r\nthrough the revolutions of this period of life seems to be favored\r\nto a special degree.\" He again states that he is unable to determine\r\nwhat rôle is played in the involutional depressions by beginning\r\narteriosclerosis or the onset of senile conditions. He concludes,\r\nhowever, that a form of depression, earlier described as melancholia,\r\nis still to be separated from the manic-depressive psychoses although\r\nnot entirely clear as to its significance or exact delimitation.[287]\r\n\r\nThese are the most severe and rapidly fatal forms of anxious\r\nexcitements, as a rule developing suddenly and included now in his\r\npresenile group. \"These cases are anxious, restless, sleepless,\r\nself-accusatory and show delusions of persecution.\" The delusional\r\nideas are depressive, extravagant and hypochondriacal. \"They have\r\noffended everybody; are eternally damned; Satan is coming and will take\r\nthem; he is out there. Nature has changed, everything is different, no\r\nmercy can come from heaven; there are ghosts in the house; the patients\r\nfind themselves in the infernal regions, are surrounded by hostile\r\npowers, are in a bewitched castle. They will be carried away, thrown\r\ninto a fiery furnace, their arms and legs cut off, have their throats\r\ncut in the presence of a thousand students, and be buried alive. They\r\nhave a cancer in the stomach, the husband is insane or has had a\r\nstroke.\" Suicidal attempts are frequent. Sometimes grandiose ideas are\r\nexpressed, accompanied by hallucinations. Apprehension and orientation\r\nare usually not disturbed. This is ordinarily followed by a period of\r\nviolent excitement with agitated wringing of the hands, striking the\r\nbreast, tearing the hair, etc. Confusional conditions with clouding may\r\nappear, often terminating shortly in a pneumonia, erysipelas or heart\r\nfailure. According to Nissl, widespread and well marked changes are to\r\nbe found in the brain at autopsy. There is an extensive destruction\r\nof ganglion cells, although that cannot be definitely associated with\r\nthe symptoms of the disease. Kraepelin leaves the question open as to\r\nwhether this should be looked upon as some form of \"acute delirium\"\r\nsuch as manifests itself in the course of various psychoses. The\r\ndisease is usually one of the sixth decade of life, much more common in\r\nthe female sex, and cannot without further information be definitely\r\nexcluded from the involutional processes. He concludes his discussion\r\nby saying that these conditions probably \"have some relation to the\r\nsimilar delirious senile forms to be discussed later.\" This is, of\r\ncourse, a decided modification of his original views, although it\r\nis quite clear that he still feels that there is an involutional\r\ndepression, now included, however, in the presenile group.\r\n\r\nIn his chapter on manic-depressive insanity three years later\r\nKraepelin[288] referred to this question again as follows:—\"Under these\r\ncircumstances I thought at first that the involutional depressions\r\ndescribed as special clinical forms, melancholia in the narrower sense,\r\n which seemed to show essential differences in its general\r\ncharacteristics, course, and to a certain extent in the history of its\r\ndevelopment, should be separated from manic-depressive insanity. At the\r\nsame time I was aware of the fact that in a considerable number of the\r\ninvolutional depressions, both on account of their clinical form and\r\ntheir association sooner or later with manic states, their connection\r\nwith manic-depressive insanity could not be questioned. I therefore\r\nmade an effort to establish a practical differentiation, entirely\r\nwithout satisfactory results. Further experience has demonstrated, as\r\nwas shown in the discussion of the presenile psychoses, that they do\r\nnot constitute grounds for the separation of melancholia. Deterioration\r\nis explained by the development of senile or arteriosclerotic changes.\r\nSome cases were of long duration, showing manic symptoms before\r\nrecovery. The frequency of depressions in advanced years we have\r\nlearned to be a legitimate development of the involutional period of\r\nlife. The substitution of anxious excitement for volitional inhibition\r\nhas proved to be an occurrence which is found in advancing years in\r\nthose cases which had an attack of the ordinary form in the decade\r\nbefore (as shown in our cases 1 and 2). Hübner has, moreover, made\r\nthe observation that melancholia may show retardation in one attack\r\nand not in the next. There remains, therefore, no adequate reason for\r\ndifferentiating the involutional depressions heretofore described as\r\nmelancholia from manic-depressive insanity.\"\r\n\r\nKehrer[289] has made a careful analysis of the facts brought out\r\nby Kraepelin's statistical diagram showing the various age groups\r\nrepresented by his manic-depressive cases. \"From the fifteenth year\r\nof life, at which age manic and melancholic attacks are most frequent\r\n(about twenty-five per cent), the curve of the manic attacks falls\r\nsteadily (with only two important rises at the thirty-fifth and the\r\nforty-fifth years) until it becomes less than five per cent at the\r\nseventieth year, while the curve of the melancholic conditions with\r\nequal constancy increases (with the exception of the fifty-fifth\r\nyear only), especially between the forty-fifth and fiftieth years,\r\nfrom fifty-two to seventy-four per cent and finally to eighty per\r\ncent. On the other hand, the curve of the manic first attacks falls\r\nsteadily from 28.5 per cent at the twentieth year to 3.5 per cent at\r\nthe sixtieth, with a slight increase at fifty from 12.7 per cent to\r\n13.4 per cent, while in the male sex the same curve shows no further\r\nincrease after the thirtieth year, when it reaches its maximum (33.8\r\nper cent) and even shows a particularly sharp fall, from 22.2 per\r\ncent to 5.9 per cent, between the fiftieth and sixtieth year....\r\nBased on this diagram Kraepelin concluded that the depressions of the\r\ninvolutional period, which did not show special symptoms of some other\r\ndisease entity, could not be differentiated from those of the earlier\r\nperiods of life.\"\r\n\r\nSpecht,[290] Hübner and Stransky have subscribed to these views.\r\nStransky expressed the opinion that \"there is nothing in the form\r\nof these depressions, either with or without anxiety, by which they\r\ncan be distinguished from those recognized as manic-depressive\r\ninsanity and that neither the course nor the age of onset offer any\r\nconvincing argument for their clinical independence.\" Rehm, on the\r\nother hand, held that there were depressions of the involutional\r\nperiod of life corresponding to Kraepelin's melancholia and not\r\nbelonging to manic-depressive insanity. He described these as lacking\r\nthe constitutional taint and characterized by a slow onset, without\r\nprevious attacks, fatigability, outspoken egocentric conduct,\r\nhypochondriacal delusions of the deteriorative type and the appearance\r\nof hallucinations. Bleuler,[291] Bumke, Seelert, Albrecht and others\r\nstill hold to the integrity of involution melancholia as a distinct\r\nentity. \"These forms,\" as Bleuler expresses it, \"have as a rule a much\r\nmore protracted course. They progress slowly for one or two years,\r\ncontinue to be mild, reaching their height in several years, and\r\ndecline slowly to their final conclusion. The inhibition is obscured\r\nby great restlessness, genuine agitated forms are common, they tend to\r\nrecidivism much less than the others and show also much less heredity.\"\r\nAlbrecht, in 138 cases of functional psychoses of the involutional\r\nperiod, only thirty-two of which were in men, diagnosed eighty-two as\r\ngenuine involution melancholia. In none of his cases did he find an\r\nisolated attack of mania in that period of life. He differentiates this\r\ncondition from agitated melancholia, leaving the question open as to\r\nwhether this constitutes a pernicious form or is a presenile disease.\r\nAccording to Bumke, psychic causes are more prominent in involution\r\nmelancholia than in the manic-depressive psychoses, the duration is\r\nlonger and they do not make such complete recoveries, the most common\r\ntermination being a depressive mental enfeeblement, with despondency\r\nand an anxious hypochondriacal mood. For the genetic interpretation of\r\nclimacteric melancholia as well as the other involutional forms the\r\nintimate association, according to Bumke, of endogenous with exogenous\r\nfactors is the point of greatest importance. \"Involution only brings\r\nthe barrel to an overflow; it only adds exogenous to the individual\r\nendogenous momentum so that the sum total leads to the outbreak of a\r\nmanifest psychosis.\" Seelert goes still further with the endogenous\r\nexogenous theory of Bumke. \"It depends on the type of the association\r\nwhether the organic anxiety psychosis, a melancholia or the depression\r\nof a manic-depressive insanity develops in the later period of life.\r\nIn one the endogenous factors predominate, in the other the exogenous\r\nand in melancholia (in its narrower sense) the two maintain a balance.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough, as has been noted, no characteristic pathological changes\r\nhave been associated with involutional melancholia, a condition to\r\nwhich attention was called by Adolf Meyer should be referred to here.\r\nIn 1901, in an article in \"Brain\" on \"The Parenchymatous Systemic\r\nDegenerations mainly in the Central Nervous System\" he proposed the\r\nname \"Central Neuritis\" for a terminal affection previously described\r\nby Turner in 1899 and occurring more frequently perhaps in involutional\r\nmelancholia than in any other psychosis:—\"This alteration has\r\nbeen found to occur in peculiar forms of end stages of depressive\r\ndisorders, near or after the climacteric period, alcoholic-senile\r\nand alcoholico-phthisical cachectic states, idiocy, and perhaps also\r\ngeneral paralysis (Turner's case). Ordinary infectious and cachectic\r\nstates do not, however, appear to form an important link in the\r\ncauses.\"[292] The mental condition is usually anxious, agitated and\r\napprehensive, often terminating in a delirium followed by a stupor.\r\nThe disease may last for a few days ending in death or may recover\r\nafter several weeks. It is accompanied by progressive weakness, loss\r\nof weight and wasting, a slight rise of temperature, and in many cases\r\nattacks of diarrhea. Characteristic are muscular tension with rigidity,\r\ntwitching movements, incoordination and jactitation of the limbs.\r\nThe reflexes are usually increased. The onset is often quite sudden,\r\nusually in the fourth, fifth or sixth decade of life. At autopsy a\r\nstriking condition, described as axonal alteration, is found in the\r\n\"Betz\" and other large ganglion cells generally. The cell body\r\nis somewhat swollen, the stainable substance is reduced to a\r\nstructureless powder and the nucleus is dislocated and appears\r\nconspicuously in the periphery. There is also some \"Marchi\"\r\ndegeneration of the fibre tracts in the motor areas. The regions\r\ninvolved, according to Meyer,[293] are \"the cortico-thalmic connections\r\nof the motor areas, the auditory radiation, the forceps, the pyramids,\r\nthe fillet, the restiform body, and to a lesser degree, the posterior\r\ncolumn of the cord, the intersegmental elements, and the segmental\r\nefferent motor elements.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the attitude of the psychiatrists of this country as shown\r\nby numerous expressions of opinion, the statistical committee of the\r\nAssociation felt justified in retaining involution melancholia in its\r\nclassification of psychoses for the present and collecting data for\r\nfurther consideration. The following suggestions were offered as to its\r\ndelimitation:—\r\n\r\n\"These depressions are probably related to the manic-depressive group;\r\nnevertheless the symptoms and the course of the involution cases are\r\nsufficiently characteristic to justify us in keeping them apart as\r\nspecial forms of emotional reaction.\r\n\r\n\"To be included here are the slowly developing depressions of _middle\r\nlife and later years_ which come on with worry, insomnia, uneasiness,\r\nanxiety and agitation, showing usually the unreality and sensory\r\ncomplex, but little or no evidence of any difficulty in thinking. The\r\ntendency is for the course to be a prolonged one. Arteriosclerotic\r\ndepressions should be excluded.\r\n\r\n\"When agitated depressions of the involution period are clearly\r\nsuperimposed on a manic-depressive foundation with previous attacks\r\n(depression or excitement) they should for statistical purposes be\r\nclassed in the manic-depressive group.\"\r\n\r\nIn view of the history of the development of the conception of this\r\npsychosis an analysis of the hospital statistics on this subject is\r\nof unusual interest. We now have reports of over seventy thousand\r\nfirst admissions based almost entirely on the classification at\r\npresent used by the Association. In 49,640 first admissions to the\r\nNew York hospitals during a period of eight years there were 1,351\r\ncases diagnosed as involution melancholia—2.72 per cent of the\r\ntotal. During 1918 and 1919, when the Association's classification\r\nwas followed in detail, these hospitals showed 480 cases, or 3.45 per\r\ncent of 13,588 first admissions. Twenty-one public institutions in\r\nfourteen other states reported 378 cases, or 2.06 per cent of 18,336\r\nadmissions. Two and twenty-five hundredths per cent of the admissions\r\nto the Massachusetts state hospitals in 1919 were cases of involution\r\nmelancholia. Reports from forty-eight different state hospitals show\r\nthat involution melancholia constituted 2.53 per cent of over seventy\r\nthousand admissions. This shows a remarkable similarity in standards of\r\ndiagnosis as far as this psychosis is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDEMENTIA PRAECOX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dementia praecox of today, notwithstanding the numerous theories\r\nwhich have been advanced as to its etiology and pathology and the\r\nvarious fundamental conceptions which have been evolved in the\r\ninterpretation of its mental mechanisms, is essentially the disease\r\ndescribed by Kraepelin in 1899. The designation which he applied to\r\nthis psychosis or group of psychoses was not new, having been used by\r\nMorel as early as 1860 and again by Pick in 1891. His views as to the\r\ndelimitation of the disease were, however, altogether different from\r\nthose of earlier writers and were destined to inaugurate a new era in\r\npsychiatry. The grouping which he proposed would include certain types\r\nof mania and melancholia and the psychoses of puberty and adolescence\r\ndescribed by Hecker and Kahlbaum together with various paranoid states\r\npreviously associated with paranoia, chronic delusional insanity, etc.\r\n\r\nKraepelin thus at one blow destroyed the integrity of mania,\r\nmelancholia, terminal dementia and paranoia, entities which had been\r\npractically unquestioned for centuries. This radical departure from\r\nestablished psychiatric procedure was based on his observation that\r\nvarious definite characteristics were common to certain cases in all of\r\nthese clinical groups and that they were of vital significance from a\r\nsymptomatic as well as a prognostic point of view. He called attention\r\nto the fact that excitements and depressions often recurred or\r\nalternated in the same individual without any tendency towards mental\r\nenfeeblement. An analysis of the mental mechanisms and symptomatology\r\nof these cases led to his well-known conception of the manic-depressive\r\npsychoses. Other clinical groups equally well-defined, although not so\r\nsharply circumscribed, showed consistent and progressive tendencies\r\ntowards mental deterioration. These were brought together and described\r\nas dementia praecox. This may be looked upon as a logical development\r\nof the progress made by the German school of psychiatrists. The first\r\nstep in this direction perhaps was the recognition of hebephrenia by\r\nHecker in 1871. He particularly emphasized the occurrence of this\r\ncondition at the time of puberty or during the adolescent period. This\r\nhas often been referred to as \"silly dementia.\" The preliminary stage\r\nor onset in many instances was characterized by a gradual change in\r\npersonality. This was evidenced by foolish behavior, silly actions\r\nand a failure of adjustment to the patient's surroundings often\r\nresulting in an abandonment of his usual occupation, with an evident\r\ngradual intellectual deterioration. Initial attacks of depression\r\nwere frequent, usually with hypochondriacal ideas and only occasional\r\nhallucinations or delusions. Transitory periods of excitement were\r\ncommon sequelae. The emotional reactions were characterized by their\r\nshallowness, the train of thought by incoherence, the conduct by\r\nfoolish and senseless acts and the intellectual reactions by an\r\nadvancing deterioration. \"The weakminded silliness of the disease\r\npicture,\" in the words of Krafft-Ebing, \"is partly to be explained by\r\nthe original weakmindedness of the patient, which Hecker emphasizes in\r\nthe etiology of his cases.\"\r\n\r\nA more decided step in the development of the dementia praecox concept\r\nwas the description by Kahlbaum of katatonia in 1874. This may be\r\nushered in by an early stage strongly suggesting hebephrenia but\r\nterminating usually in a depression followed by states of excitement,\r\nstupor and dementia. The characteristic features of the disease are\r\nthe peculiar catatonic stupor so-called, and forms of excitement\r\ndiffering materially from those exhibited in the manic-depressive\r\npsychoses. Hallucinations and delusions are almost invariably present.\r\nThe delusions are likely to be of a most absurd and extravagant type,\r\naccompanied by self-accusation in some instances but oftener by\r\nfeelings of influence referred to others or somatic ideas. States of\r\nmuscular tension appear early, with constrained attitudes and peculiar\r\nmannerisms. The stupor which is such a prominent feature in the picture\r\nis characterized by negativism shown by a resistance to all external\r\ninfluences, mutism and a refusal to accept food. This may be associated\r\nwith rigidity due to extreme muscular tension which is often so marked\r\nas to be described as cataleptic. Automatism may manifest itself in the\r\nform of echolalia or echopraxia. The excitements are characterized by\r\nimpulsive acts of violence. Verbigeration and stereotypy are frequent\r\nsymptoms. Remissions are rather to be expected but the tendency of the\r\ndisease is towards a marked mental deterioration in the great majority\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\nSchüle in 1886 suggested the term dementia praecox as one applicable\r\nto the psychoses of adolescence. It remained for Kraepelin, however,\r\nto establish the entity of these disease processes by including still\r\nanother type, the paranoid forms, which were left entirely unaccounted\r\nfor in the conceptions of Hecker, Kahlbaum, Schüle, Morel, Pick, or\r\nany of the earlier writers. In this group he included cases with\r\npersistent hallucinations, more or less loosely systematized delusions\r\nof persecution and gradually increasing deterioration but with little\r\nor no clouding of consciousness.\r\n\r\nIn the last edition of his book Kraepelin[294] defines dementia praecox\r\nas including \"a group of clinical pictures having the common symptom of\r\na characteristic destruction of the internal associations of the psychic\r\npersonality affecting particularly the emotional and volitional\r\nspheres\".... \"Although wide differences of opinion still exist on\r\nmany points, the conviction seems to be gaining ground more and more\r\nthat dementia praecox on the whole represents a well-defined disease\r\nentity, and that we are justified in regarding the majority at least\r\nof the apparently dissimilar clinical types here described as the\r\nmanifestations of a single disease process.\" Many objections have been\r\nraised to the name applied to this psychosis by Kraepelin. It has been\r\npointed out that complete deterioration is not always the termination\r\nto be expected in this group and that it is not always a disease of\r\nadolescence. All of this was conceded by Kraepelin. He employed the\r\nterm as one answering the purpose \"until a more thorough understanding\r\nwould suggest an appropriate designation.\" His conception of the\r\npsychosis as described in the sixth edition of his book may, I think,\r\nbe said to have received the rather general approval of the psychiatric\r\nworld. While there has been no serious attack on his delimitation of\r\nthe disease entity itself, there has been a decided controversy as to\r\nthe psychological mechanisms involved and the fundamental principles\r\nupon which his conceptions were based. Certainly no textbook of recent\r\nyears has failed to give a very serious consideration to the question\r\nof dementia praecox.\r\n\r\nStransky (1909) looked upon dementia praecox as the result of a lack\r\nof coordination of the intellect, the emotions and volition, which\r\nhe expresses as an intrapsychic ataxia. This is illustrated by the\r\ndisplacement of the affect so common in dementia praecox and its\r\nassociation with an entirely incongruous idea. Thus, the patient laughs\r\nwhile expressing an exceedingly depressing delusional belief or cries\r\nwhile telling a joke. No emotion is displayed at the statement that\r\nhe is being buried alive or torn apart by some outside agency. This\r\nwould possibly explain the unprovoked rages of the catatonic and the\r\ndiscrepancy between the catalepsy and mutism of a patient who is found\r\nto be perfectly oriented as to his surroundings and the curious fact\r\nthat he is often thoroughly clear as to the exact day and date.\r\n\r\nWernicke's theories regarding the elaboration of mental mechanisms\r\nhave already been referred to. He saw in dementia praecox and other\r\ndeteriorative processes the possibility of a dissociation of psychical\r\nreflexes due to an interruption or disturbance located in the\r\npsychomotor projection field, preventing its proper coordination with\r\nthe intrapsychic elaboration mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe psychological processes involved in schizophrenia as outlined by\r\nBleuler[295] (1911) have a very important bearing on the interpretation\r\nof the symptoms of dementia praecox. The group which he described\r\nunder this designation is a very broad one, including \"many atypical\r\nmelancholias and manias of other schools (as well as hysterical\r\nmelancholias and manias), the most of the hallucinatory confusions,\r\nmany of the amentias described by others (our conception of amentia\r\nis much narrower), some of the forms belonging to acute delirium,\r\nWernicke's motility psychoses, primary and secondary dementias without\r\nspecial designations, the most of the paranoias of other schools,\r\nespecially the hysterical paranoias and almost all of the incurable\r\nhypochondrias, nervousness, compulsions and impulsions.\" To these he\r\nadds the various \"juvenile and masturbation forms,\" a large part of the\r\ndegenerative psychoses of Magnan, many prison psychoses and the Ganser\r\nsymptom complex. In view of the fact, as Bleuler[296] expresses it, that\r\n\"The name dementia praecox, which neither leads to dementia nor\r\nis precocious in its origin, necessarily, gave rise to many\r\nmisunderstandings,\" he suggested the designation schizophrenia as more\r\nappropriate. \"Even if we cannot make a natural grouping, it would\r\nappear that schizophrenia is not a disease in the narrower sense but\r\na group of diseases somewhat analogous to the organic group, which\r\nincludes paralysis, the senile forms, etc. Schizophrenia should\r\ntherefore be spoken of really in the plural. The disease pursues a\r\nchronic course or progresses in attacks and may come to a standstill\r\nat any stage or may even regress but never to a complete restitutio\r\nad integrum. It is characterized by a specific type of alteration in\r\nthinking, feeling and relation to the outer world encountered nowhere\r\nelse. Accessory symptoms of a characteristic type are particularly\r\ncommon.... Dementia praecox in any stage may come to a stop, and\r\nmany of its symptoms partially or entirely disappear but when it\r\nprogresses further it leads to dementia and dementia of a definite\r\ntype.\" A fundamental symptom, according to Bleuler, is the disturbance\r\nof association of ideas. \"The normal association of ideas loses its\r\nstability; others enter at will and take their place. Thus the ideas\r\nlose their relation to each other and thought becomes incoherent.\"\r\nAs Hoch[297] says of this disturbance, \"Bleuler described it very\r\nextensively, and yet somehow it is not so very easy to grasp the nature\r\nof this disorder; it is evidently not so very different from Wernicke's\r\nsejunction, though free from all localizing anatomical bywork. It is\r\nconceived of as a more or less widespread primary interruption of\r\nthe associative connection of ideas. Actual or latent associations,\r\nwhich, in the normal, determine the train of thought or combinations\r\nof such ideas may remain without influence upon it in an apparently\r\naimless fashion, whereas other ideas which have no connection may\r\nintrude themselves. Hence the train of thought is scattered, bizarre,\r\nillogical, abrupt. This may be so slight that it is difficult to\r\ndiscover, and in his description of mild conditions he says it may not\r\nbe found, or only after a thorough search; it accounts for much of the\r\nscattering of ideas in chronic states, and, as we have said, it is\r\nsupposed to be the explanatory principle in acute incoherence. On the\r\nother hand, similar phenomena may be due to the action of complexes,\r\nand have to be explained psychogenically. But the psychogenic\r\nexplanation does not appear to him sufficient. It is somewhat difficult\r\nto see, especially when we consider the extensive symbolization and\r\nsubstitution, the indifference, the negativism, etc., why something\r\nbeyond these psychogenically explicable disorders is required.\" An\r\nessential feature of Bleuler's[298] concept is \"autismus.\" \"The\r\nschizophrenics lose their contact with reality, the mild cases\r\ninconspicuously here and there, the severe cases, completely\".... \"When\r\nwe allow our fancies free reign in mythology, in dreams and in many\r\nof the morbid states, thought will not or cannot concern itself with\r\nrealities; it follows the dictates of instincts and emotions. This\r\ndisregarding of the inconsistency with reality is characteristic of\r\nautistic thinking.\"\r\n\r\nIn his excellent review of Bleuler's schizophrenia already referred to,\r\nHoch[299] makes the following comments on this subject:—\"A difficult\r\nsubject is autism. By autism Bleuler means that which we have called\r\nthe shut in tendency, the more or less complete shutting out of the\r\nenvironment, or at any rate, all that which does not correspond to the\r\nwishes. It may be so marked that the patients even shut out all sensory\r\nimpressions, close their eyes and ears, make their body as small as\r\npossible by crouching. Bleuler regards this autism as a secondary\r\nphenomenon, and looks upon it as one of the results of his association\r\ndisorder, whereas the autistic thinking is the day-dreaming, the\r\nthinking without reference to reality. This autistic thinking\r\nflourishes in schizophrenia—Bleuler thinks that the schizophrenic\r\ndefect in logic makes the exclusion of a great many external and\r\ninternal facts possible, and thus gives sway to a tendency which we\r\nall have, namely, to live in fancies which suit us, something which we\r\nindulge in but do not allow to influence our conduct, but which in the\r\nschizophrenic assumes the value of reality.\" An outline of Bleuler's\r\nviews would not be complete without his definition of blocking,[300]\r\nan important symptom. \"Blocking is a sudden emotional inhibition of\r\nthe psychic processes and in itself not pathological.\" He found it in\r\nnormal individuals in nervousness and in hysteria. \"Where it is not\r\nbased on adequate psychological grounds, is generalized or of long\r\nduration, its presence warrants the diagnosis of schizophrenia.\"\r\n\r\nA study of the psychogenic factors concerned in dementia praecox\r\nled Meyer[301] to the conclusion that the psychological processes\r\nof the disease were due to abnormal mental mechanisms developing\r\nin individuals unable to adjust themselves to their surroundings.\r\n\"The general principle is that many individuals cannot afford to\r\ncount on unlimited elasticity in the habitual use of certain habits\r\nof adjustment, that instincts will be undermined by persistent\r\nmisapplication, and the delicate balance of mental adjustment and of\r\nits material substratum must largely depend on a maintenance of sound\r\ninstinct and reaction type.\" This theory is supported somewhat by the\r\n\"shut in personality\" found by Hoch[302] in his studies of the history\r\nof a large number of cases developing dementia praecox.\r\n\r\nElaborate analyses of the psychological mechanisms involved in dementia\r\npraecox have been made by Jung and others. Freud believed hysteria to\r\nbe the result of a psychic trauma. The unpleasant idea associated with\r\nthis trauma is repressed into the subconscious because the individual\r\nis unable to react to it in a normal way and it is forgotten, but not\r\nuntil it is compensated for by a hysterical symbol or symptom which\r\ntakes its place. By means of psychoanalysis, the association test and\r\nthe study of dreams the nature of the psychic trauma can often be\r\ndetermined. Jung[303] adapted these methods of study to a consideration\r\nof dementia praecox. His investigations showed that many of the\r\nseemingly meaningless manifestations of that disease are symbols or\r\nsubstitutes for buried complexes. In some instances these remain in\r\ntheir original form without transformation. Complexes associated with\r\na feeling of deficiency and injured pride may lead to suspicion and\r\ndelusions of persecution. Unfulfilled longings may be actualized in a\r\ndelirium or delusion of grandeur. Symbols and substitutes generally\r\nare said to represent complexes which are antagonistic to the ego and\r\nare therefore transformed and become unrecognizable. The peculiar\r\nsymptoms of dementia praecox as a rule are a result of the individual's\r\ninability to make compensatory readjustments. In the paranoid forms the\r\npatient entirely reconstructs his psychical life. White[304] attempts\r\nto explain the meaning of some of these delusional formations in his\r\n\"Outlines of Psychiatry\":—\"The relation of the delusion to the complex\r\nis often obvious if one is familiar with the more important of the\r\ninfantile material. A man believes himself pregnant, that a child\r\nis in his stomach. This is obviously a regression to the period when\r\nas an infant he had not understood that gestation was a particular\r\nfunction of the female. Another patient enucleated his eye (castration\r\nsymbol); a colored man of about forty years of age invented a\r\nperpetual motion machine (compensation for impotence); a man tries\r\nto invent the greatest cannon on earth (compensation for small penis\r\ncomplex); a homosexual man of the \"sissy\" type made wild claims of\r\nphysical prowess, fighting ability, and incessantly swore and used\r\nvulgar language to demonstrate his toughness (over-compensation of\r\nhomosexuality); a woman complains that her sister's husband follows\r\nher through underground passageways and shoots electricity into her\r\ngenitalia and anus (anal erotism); an oral erotic woman starves\r\nherself in order to be tube fed; oral erotic patients often cut their\r\nthroats while under the erotic pressure; patients frequently say that\r\nGod talks with them or go to Washington to see the President (father\r\ncomplex); in severe grades of introversion they sit in a dark corner,\r\nhead on breast, arms folded and legs and thighs flexed (intra-uterine\r\nposition); a young woman says her real parents are the King and Queen\r\nof Norway (Œdipus phantasy); etc. Of course much of the delusional\r\nmaterial is not so obviously related to infantile material and must\r\nbe worked out at length with the individual to determine its meaning.\r\nIt must not be forgotten that a praecox may have, however, complex\r\nreactions exactly like that of hysteria and the psychoneuroses. To that\r\nextent such a patient is hysterical or psychoneurotic.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the last edition of his textbook showed that\r\nKraepelin has somewhat revised his views on the subject of dementia\r\npraecox. He now speaks of a series of morbid pictures \"brought together\r\nunder the designation endogenous dementias for the purpose of a\r\npreliminary understanding.\" This embraces not only dementia praecox\r\nbut a new entity described as \"paraphrenia.\"[305] This includes forms\r\n\"which, contrary to the usual manifestations of dementia praecox, are\r\ncharacterized throughout their entire course by the marked prominence\r\nof a characteristic intellectual disturbance while an independent\r\nimpairment of volition and particularly an emotional alteration are\r\nlacking or only present in a mild form. For this differentiation it\r\nseems to me that no more suitable expression than \"paraphrenia\" could\r\nbe employed for the designation of the disease processes experimentally\r\nbrought together here.\" He speaks of the following types:—systematica,\r\nexpansiva, confabulans and phantastica.\r\n\r\nThe clinical forms of dementia praecox shown in his last edition are as\r\nfollows:—dementia simplex, hebephrenia, simple depressive or stuporous\r\ndementia, depressive delusional dementia, circular, agitated and\r\nperiodic forms, katatonia, paranoid types (dementia paranoides gravis\r\nand mitis, hallucinatory and paranoid feeblemindedness) and confusional\r\nspeech or schizophasia.\r\n\r\nHis views as to the delimitation of these different types should be\r\nexpressed perhaps in his own words:[306]\r\n\r\n\"Simple progressive deterioration as described by Diem under the\r\ndesignation of 'Dementia Simplex,' consists in an imperceptible and\r\ncomplete impoverishment and breaking down of the entire mental life.\"\r\n\r\nOf hebephrenia or silly dementia he says, \"In this disease picture\r\nthere stands out particularly with the progressive deterioration of the\r\nmental life, an incoherence of thought, feeling, and conduct.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the third group of dementia praecox I should like to group\r\ntogether, under the designation of simple depressive or stuporous\r\ndementia, those cases in which, after an initial depression, with or\r\nwithout the appearance of stupor, a terminal mental deterioration\r\ngradually develops.\"\r\n\r\n\"Those cases which progress to the marked development of phantastic\r\ndelusions we group together in the fourth form of dementia\r\npraecox—depressive delusional dementia.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next large group includes those cases in which severe and\r\nprotracted excitements develop.\"\r\n\r\n\"The first sub group which on account of its course we may designate as\r\nthe circular form shows the nearest relationship to the disease picture\r\njust described in that it also begins with a depression and usually\r\nmanifests active delusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a second sub group, the agitated form, we bring together those\r\ncases in which the disease begins with an excitement and then\r\nimmediately or after more or less frequent remissions and relapse\r\npasses into the terminal stage.\"\r\n\r\n\"In close relation to the cases brought together here we have to\r\nconsider a small group which either in the initial stages of the\r\ndisease or throughout its entire duration follows an outspoken periodic\r\ncourse; these amount to less than 2 per cent of all cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"The excitements of dementia praecox constitute an important part of\r\nthe clinical form—Katatonia—which we must now consider. Under this\r\ndesignation Kahlbaum described a disease picture which in turn presents\r\nthe symptoms of melancholia, mania and stupor, the unfavorable cases\r\nbeing accompanied by confusion and deterioration and is furthermore\r\ncharacterized by the appearance of certain motor seizures and\r\ninhibitions—in other words, the catatonic disorders.\"\r\n\r\n\"In many respects a dissimilar picture is shown by those cases in\r\nwhich the essential symptoms are delusions and hallucinations; these\r\nwe characterize as paranoid forms. The justification for including\r\nthem with dementia praecox I get from the fact that in them sooner or\r\nlater the delusion formation is invariably associated with a series of\r\ndisturbances which we find everywhere in the other forms of dementia\r\npraecox.\"\r\n\r\nCases \"which do begin with a simple delusion formation but which in\r\nthe further course exhibit still more clearly the peculiar destruction\r\nof the mental life and particularly the emotional and volitional\r\ndisturbances which characterize dementia praecox may be grouped\r\ntogether under the name 'dementia paranoides gravis'.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a fourth form of paranoid dementia praecox, I believe still\r\nanother group should be added, those which on the one hand show a\r\nsimilar development and the same delusion formation as the paranoid\r\ndisorders just described but which on the other hand terminate in a\r\ncharacteristic mental enfeeblement.\" These he would call 'dementia\r\nparanoides mitis'.\"\r\n\r\n\"A last very characteristic group of cases the discussion of which must\r\nbe included here, is formed by the patients with confusional speech.\"\r\nThese are the Schizophasias of Bleuler.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that in view of Kraepelin's former contributions\r\non this subject this classification must be looked upon as somewhat\r\ninvolved and confusing. It suggests an unnecessary complication of\r\nan already difficult subject to no great advantage. These varying\r\nconceptions are difficult to understand. Perhaps, as Meyer[307]\r\nexpresses it, \"the symptomatology in its first formulation in 1895,\r\nand later, emphasized too many things which prevail also in other\r\nconditions, so that altogether too many errors occurred. In four\r\nhundred and sixty-eight of Kraepelin's Munich diagnoses even between\r\n1904 and 1906, 28.8 per cent were cases subsequently considered\r\nto be manic-depressive (Zendig)—altogether too broad a margin of\r\nuncertainty.\"\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the whole situation the conclusion reached by\r\nBuckley[308] would appear to be thoroughly established:—\"Most\r\nauthorities agree, however, that the term dementia praecox includes\r\nthe psychoses which appear prior to mental maturity (early in some and\r\nmuch later in others), with a tendency to permanent mental defect in\r\nthe long run, but which may follow a chronic course, may be divided\r\ninto attacks, or may improve or stop at any stage, but never with\r\nrestoration to absolute normal health.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the elaborate investigations of Alzheimer, Sioli,\r\nKlippel, Lhermitte, Moriyasu, Goldstein, Nissl and many others,\r\nno definite pathological basis for dementia praecox has ever been\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nFor purposes of statistical study in the collection of data relative to\r\nthis disease entity, as in all other cases, the American Psychiatric\r\nAssociation has endeavored to adhere to fundamental conceptions\r\ngenerally accepted by the profession and has avoided as far as possible\r\nadherence to the tenets of any one school. For purposes of uniformity\r\nthe following suggestions were made in the \"statistical manual\" as to\r\nthe classification of psychoses to be reported under the designation of\r\ndementia praecox.\r\n\r\n\"This group cannot be satisfactorily defined at the present time as\r\nthere are still too many points at issue as to what constitute the\r\nessential clinical features of dementia praecox. A large majority of\r\nthe cases which should go into this group may, however, be recognized\r\nwithout special difficulty, although there is an important smaller\r\ngroup of doubtful, atypical, allied or transitional cases which from\r\nthe standpoint of symptoms or prognosis occupy an uncertain clinical\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\"Cases formerly classed as allied to dementia praecox should be placed\r\nhere rather than in the undiagnosed group. The term \"schizophrenia\" is\r\nnow used by many writers instead of dementia praecox.\r\n\r\n\"The following mentioned features are sufficiently well established\r\nto be considered most characteristic of the dementia praecox type of\r\nreaction:\r\n\r\n\"A seclusive type of personality or one showing other evidences of\r\nabnormality in the development of the instincts and feelings.\r\n\r\n\"Appearance of defects of interest and discrepancies between thought on\r\nthe one hand and the behavior-emotional reactions on the other.\r\n\r\n\"A gradual blunting of the emotions, indifference or silliness with\r\nserious defects of judgment and often hypochondriacal complaints,\r\nsuspicions or ideas of reference.\r\n\r\n\"Development of peculiar trends, often fantastic ideas, with odd,\r\nimpulsive or negativistic conduct not accounted for by any acute\r\nemotional disturbance or impairment of the sensorium.\r\n\r\n\"Appearance of autistic thinking and dream-like ideas, peculiar\r\nfeelings of being forced, of interference with the mind, of physical or\r\nmystical influences, but with retention of clearness in other fields\r\n(orientation, memory, etc.).\r\n\r\n\"According to the prominence of certain symptoms in individual\r\ncases the following four clinical forms of dementia praecox may be\r\nspecified, but it should be borne in mind that these are only relative\r\ndistinctions and that transitions from one clinical form to another are\r\ncommon:\r\n\r\n\"(a) Paranoid type: Cases characterized by a prominence of delusions,\r\nparticularly ideas of persecution or grandeur, often connectedly\r\nelaborated, and hallucinations in various fields.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Catatonic type: Cases in which there is a prominence of\r\nnegativistic reactions or various peculiarities of conduct with phases\r\nof stupor or excitement, the latter characterized by impulsive, queer\r\nor stereotyped behavior and usually hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Hebephrenic type: Cases showing prominently a tendency to\r\nsilliness, smiling, laughter, grimacing, mannerisms in speech and\r\naction, and numerous peculiar ideas usually absurd, grotesque and\r\nchangeable in form.\r\n\r\n\"(d) Simple type: Cases characterized by defects of interest, gradual\r\ndevelopment of an apathetic state, often with peculiar behavior, but\r\nwithout expression of delusions or hallucinations.\r\n\r\n\"(e) Other types.\"\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of reports has been received from hospitals using\r\nthis classification to warrant a preliminary survey of the information\r\navailable at this time on the subject of dementia praecox. Perhaps it\r\nwould be well to summarize first such information as is to be obtained\r\nfrom other sources. Diefendorf[309] states that dementia praecox\r\nconstitutes from fourteen to thirty per cent of all admissions to\r\ninstitutions, fifty-eight per cent of the total number being of the\r\nhebephrenic, eighteen per cent, of the catatonic, and twenty-two per\r\ncent, of the paranoid variety. Kraepelin[310] (1913) found that dementia\r\npraecox constituted ten per cent of all admissions, classified as to\r\ntypes as follows:—Silly dementia, thirteen per cent; simple depressive\r\ndementia, ten per cent; delusional depressive dementia, thirteen per\r\ncent; circular dementia, nine per cent; agitated dementia, fourteen\r\nper cent; periodic dementia, two per cent; and katatonia, 19.5 per\r\ncent. He reported a history of hereditary taint in seventy per cent of\r\nhis cases. Diefendorf found the onset of the disease in sixty per cent\r\nof all cases before the twenty-fifth year, Kraepelin, in fifty-seven\r\nper cent. Kraepelin[311] states that seizures occurred in twenty-one\r\nper cent of his cases of silly dementia and in the other types as\r\nfollows:—simple depressive dementia, seventeen per cent; delusional\r\ndepressive dementia, twenty-seven per cent; circular dementia, twenty\r\nper cent; agitated dementia, twenty per cent; katatonia, seventeen per\r\ncent; paranoid dementia gravis, three per cent and paranoid dementia\r\nmitis, five per cent. Unfortunately a survey of the other literature of\r\nthe day throws little additional light on these subjects.\r\n\r\nA study of the statistical reports made by Pollock for the State\r\nHospital Commission shows that during the five years ending on June\r\n30, 1919, dementia praecox constituted 14.42 per cent of the 2,024\r\nvoluntary cases admitted to the thirteen New York state hospitals.\r\nDuring a period of eight years ending on June 30, 1919, there were\r\n49,640 first admissions to the New York state hospitals; 12,199,\r\nor 24.57 per cent, of these were diagnosed as dementia praecox or\r\nconditions allied thereto. The \"allied\" conditions have not been shown\r\nin the New York reports since 1917. In 1918 and 1919 there were 13,588\r\nfirst admissions, 3,753, or 27.61 per cent, of which were cases of\r\ndementia praecox. This would indicate an increase in the incidence of\r\nthat disease in New York during recent years. The Massachusetts first\r\nadmissions for 1918 and 1919 show a total of 7,582 cases, 1900, or\r\n25.05 per cent, of which were dementia praecox. It will be noted that\r\nthe percentage is practically the same as that of New York for the same\r\nyears. In a group of twenty-one other state hospitals, representing\r\nfourteen different states using the Association's classification,\r\n18,336 first admissions have been reported, 3,856, or 21.03 per cent,\r\nof which were cases of dementia praecox. This represents a variation\r\nfrom the New York and Massachusetts findings which can be explained on\r\nvarious grounds, largely by the fact that these institutions represent\r\na rural population. We have thus in all 70,987 first admissions to\r\nstate hospitals, with 16,920 cases of dementia praecox, representing\r\n23.84 per cent of the total number.\r\n\r\nA consideration of the different types of this disease as represented\r\nby the various state institutions shows somewhat different results.\r\nIn New York during the years 1916-17-18-19 there were 6,135 cases of\r\ndementia praecox shown in the first admissions, classified as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Type_      _Number of Cases_   _Percentage_\r\n\r\n  Paranoid          3579              58.34\r\n  Catatonic          468               7.63\r\n  Hebephrenic       1463              23.84\r\n  Simple             625              10.19\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts in 1917-18-19 there were 2,921 cases, distributed as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Paranoid          1248              42.72\r\n  Catatonic          678              23.21\r\n  Hebephrenic        828              28.34\r\n  Simple             165               5.64\r\n\r\nIn a group of nineteen other institutions there were 3,184 cases, as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  Paranoid           800              25.12\r\n  Catatonic          438              10.61\r\n  Hebephrenic       1666              52.32\r\n  Simple             230               7.22\r\n\r\nWe have thus a total of 12,240 cases, a composite group classified\r\naccording to types as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Paranoid          5627              45.97\r\n  Catatonic         1584              12.12\r\n  Hebephrenic       3957              32.32\r\n  Simple            1020               8.33\r\n\r\nAlthough this is probably the largest group of cases of dementia\r\npraecox recorded we are, unfortunately, not warranted as yet in\r\nattempting any final conclusions. The Massachusetts and New York\r\nstatistics of late years would, I think, justify the tentative\r\nstatement, at least, that dementia praecox admissions represent\r\napproximately twenty-eight per cent of all cases coming into our\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to analyze the types of the disease as reported, it\r\nat once becomes evident that there are very divergent standards of\r\ndiagnosis. There is a radical difference shown in the consideration\r\nof the so-called simple dementia praecox with a general average of\r\n8.33 per cent. In Massachusetts there is a much higher percentage of\r\nthe catatonic forms, with a predominance in New York of the paranoid\r\nvariety. The proportion of hebephrenic types in the other nineteen\r\ninstitutions is at wide variance with the reports of Massachusetts\r\nand New York. In all probability the percentage shown in the analysis\r\nof the total number from forty-six state hospitals is not far from\r\nrepresenting conditions existing in American institutions. A careful\r\nstudy of more complete reports extending over a number of years should\r\nsettle this question to what may be spoken of as almost a mathematical\r\ncertainty.\r\n\r\nPollock and Nolan[312] have made a study of 9,124 admissions of\r\ndementia praecox to the New York hospitals during a period of six and\r\nthree-quarters years. Of these cases 52.2 per cent were men and 47.8\r\nper cent, women. The distribution shown by age groups is interesting\r\nand significant, as is shown by the following table:—\r\n\r\n  _Age Group_       _Percentage_\r\n  Under 15 years        .2\r\n  15 to 19   \"         7.8\r\n  20 \"  24   \"        20.1\r\n  25 \"  29   \"        22.0\r\n  30 \"  34   \"        16.6\r\n  35 \"  39   \"        13.5\r\n  40 \"  44   \"         8.4\r\n  45 \"  49   \"         5.3\r\n\r\nThis would not appear to suggest an adolescent origin for this disease\r\nto the extent advocated in our textbooks. The highest rate shown by\r\nmales was in the age group from twenty-five to twenty-nine years and in\r\nthe female cases, from thirty-five to thirty-nine years. Forty-nine per\r\ncent were thirty years or over at the time of admission, forty-three\r\nper cent were between twenty and thirty years of age and thirty per\r\ncent, between thirty and forty. Nineteen per cent were forty years or\r\nover at the time of admission. Pollock's[313] investigation, the most\r\nexhaustive statistical study yet made of dementia praecox, shows that\r\nfifty per cent of the cases have a family history of insanity, nervous\r\ndiseases, alcoholism or neuropathic or psychopathic traits, with a\r\nfull fifty per cent showing no evidence of unfavorable heredity. This\r\nagain is at variance with opinions usually expressed on this subject.\r\nForty-six per cent were of normal mental makeup and seventy-eight per\r\ncent intellectually normal before the onset of the psychosis. Alcohol\r\nwas an assigned etiological factor in four per cent of these cases and\r\nthere was a history of intemperance in eight per cent of the others.\r\nThe incidence of dementia praecox is more than three times as great in\r\ncities as it is in the rural districts. The average length of hospital\r\nresidence was sixteen years. The foreign born dementia praecox first\r\nadmissions were found to be principally from Austria, Germany, Hungary,\r\nIreland, Italy and Russia. Fifty-one and four-tenths per cent of the\r\ncases were natives of this country and 48.3 per cent, of foreign birth.\r\nIt is interesting to note that in 1919, 39.9 per cent of the first\r\nadmissions to the New York institutions for the criminal insane were\r\ncases of dementia praecox. The rate of admission was 37.1 per cent in\r\n1918, 20.5 per cent in 1917, 30.8 per cent in 1916 and 32.8 per cent in\r\n1915. Of the 37,607 patients in the New York state hospitals on June\r\n30, 1919, 22,036, or 58.8 per cent, were cases of dementia praecox. One\r\nhundred and thirty-eight were discharged as recovered during a period\r\nof three years. This number represented 5.2 per cent of the cases of\r\ndementia praecox discharged during that time, 2.01 per cent of those\r\nadmitted, 1.1 per cent of all discharges, and .6 per cent of all first\r\nadmissions. A review of the cause of death in 2,988 cases shows that\r\nthe rate for tuberculosis was thirty-three per cent during four years\r\nwhen there was no influenza epidemic. This constituted over fifty-nine\r\nper cent of all of the deaths due to tuberculosis during that period of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nDementia praecox with the highest admission rate of any of the\r\npsychoses, its exceedingly unfavorable recovery rate, its extreme\r\nsusceptibility to tuberculosis, and representing as it does over\r\none-half of the population of our hospitals, must unquestionably be\r\nlooked upon as the most important form of mental disease with which\r\nwe have to deal today. The number of cases of dementia praecox in the\r\nMassachusetts and New York hospitals justifies the statement that there\r\nare approximately 120,000 persons suffering from this disease in the\r\ninstitutions of the United States, their maintenance alone costing the\r\ncountry twenty-five million dollars annually. Their permanent removal\r\nwould make it possible to close at least sixty institutions larger than\r\nany state hospital in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPARANOIA AND THE PARANOID CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nA discussion of the part played by paranoia, or the paranoid\r\nconditions however characterized, in the psychiatry of the present\r\nday, is essentially a review of the final chapter in the history of\r\na psychiatric conception which is several centuries old. The word\r\nparanoia, like many other terms still in use, is of Greek origin\r\nand was apparently applied by Hippocrates in a very general way to\r\n\"madness\" of any or all forms. It almost certainly had no more definite\r\nsignificance than that, in the works of Plato and Aristotle, nor can it\r\nbe said to have been used in its modern sense by Celsus or Aretaeus.\r\nIt seems to have meant something more in the vocabulary of Vogel, an\r\neighteenth century writer. Under the heading of paranoia, according\r\nto Jelliffe,[314] Plocquet in 1772 included Paracope or delirium with\r\nsix subdivisions:—(a) pathetica, (b) phronestica, (c) entomica,\r\n(d) encephalica, (e) hyperesthetica, and (f) sympathica. It was not\r\nrecognized to any great extent by the earlier writers of the French\r\nschool, but occupied a very prominent place in the development of\r\nGerman psychiatry. Heinroth in 1818 included the paranoias in his\r\ndisorders of the intellect under the name of verrücktheit, a word that\r\nwas destined to become one of great importance later, and spoke of an\r\nexaltation of the feelings which he called \"paranoia ecstasia.\"\r\n\r\nFlemming[315] in his elaborate classification of psychoses in 1844\r\ndescribed paranoid forms of \"mania adstricta\" or partial mania\r\n(monomania). Stark, a contemporary of Flemming's, made what seems\r\nto be a very direct reference to paranoia in his discussion of\r\n\"Wahnsinn,\" as did Weiss in 1842. Von Feuchtersleben in 1845 wrote a\r\nvery exhaustive description of \"fixed delusions\" which he classified\r\nas either involving the personality (mania metamorphosis) or as being\r\nambitious, religious or relating to love (erotomania). He also spoke\r\nof a monomania or mania sine delirio which he attributed to Pinel. The\r\nexact significance of these conceptions cannot be determined.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Griesinger used the word verrücktheit as applying to a\r\nsecondary incurable condition, exhibiting delusions of persecution\r\nand grandeur and usually developing after an attack of mania or\r\nmelancholia. He also defined Wahnsinn, which he compared to Heinroth's\r\n\"paranoia ecstasia,\" as including \"states of exaltation characterized\r\nby assertive, expansive emotions, associated with persistent excessive\r\nself-estimation and extravagant fixed delusions which arise therefrom.\"\r\nMagnan spoke of \"folie systematisée progressive\" and a \"folie\r\nsystematisée des dégénérés.\" In his \"Le Délire Chronique à Évolution\r\nSystematique\" he divided paranoia into a stage of subjective analysis,\r\none of persecution and a third of transformation of the personality.\r\nLasègue described this same condition under the name of persecution\r\nmania in 1852. Falret and Ritti divided the course of this disease\r\ninto four periods, one of insane interpretations, one of visual\r\nhallucinations, one of general sensory derangement and a stereotyped\r\nstate or mania of ambition. Morel was of the opinion that these\r\npsychoses were always preceded by an initial period of hypochondriasis.\r\n\r\nPritchard described as monomania a form of insanity \"characterized by\r\nsome particular illusion or erroneous conviction impressed upon the\r\nunderstanding, and giving rise to a partial aberration of judgment.\"\r\nEsquirol devoted as many as one hundred and thirty pages to a study\r\nof monomania, which he subdivided into seven forms:—the erotic,\r\n\"raisonnante\" or moral insanity, the alcoholic, the incendiary, the\r\nhomicidal, the suicidal and the hypochondriacal.\r\n\r\nIt was probably the work of Mendel in 1881 which was responsible for\r\nthe use of the word paranoia in its modern sense. He spoke of primary\r\nand secondary paranoias.[316] The former was described as a \"functional\r\npsychosis characterized by the primary appearance of delusional ideas.\r\nThe delusions of primary paranoia, without being interfered with by\r\nany opposing ideas, control the entire mental life of the patient.\r\nThe remaining ideas not affected by morbid processes stand in close\r\nrelation, but not in conflict, with the dominating delusions. The\r\nfeelings are determined by the content of the delusions and vary with\r\nthem. In the same way the abnormalities of conduct are due to the\r\ncontent of the delusional ideas, with or without hallucinations.\" Régis\r\nin 1892 described his systematized progressive insanity as involving\r\nthree distinct stages,—one of subjective analysis, a stage either\r\nof persecution, religious exaltation or eroticism and jealousy, and\r\nfinally a megalomanic state ending occasionally in dementia. Cramer,\r\nin an elaborate review of the literature of paranoia in 1894, refers\r\nto twenty-eight different designations used by various writers in the\r\ndiscussion of this subject up to that time. Serieux and Copgras (1909)\r\ninclude deliria of interpretation and of vindication in their grouping\r\nof these conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the words of Meyer, paranoia eventually reached its high water\r\nmark in the work of Krafft-Ebing.[317] He defined it as \"a chronic\r\nmental disease occurring exclusively in tainted individuals, frequently\r\ndeveloping out of the constitutional neuroses, the principal symptoms\r\nof which are delusions.\" These are devoid of all emotional foundation\r\nand from the beginning are systematized, methodic and \"combined by the\r\nprocesses of judgment, constituting a formal delusional structure.\r\nConsciousness is not disturbed and judgment as a rule is not impaired\r\nbut is entirely based on delusional premises.\" The conduct of the\r\nindividual is determined by his hallucinations and delusions. The\r\nprocess of development is slow and the disease remains stationary for\r\nmany years, but never ends in dementia. In a study of over one thousand\r\ncases Krafft-Ebing[318] never observed a definite recovery, although\r\nlucid intervals occurred, generally in the beginning of the disease.\r\nThe taint of paranoia he describes as heredity, in the form of abnormal\r\ncharacter, psychoses, constitutional neuroses and alcoholism. In a few\r\ninstances he reported developmental defects in the brain. He found in\r\nall cases an anomaly of personality which determined the later form\r\nof the paranoia. Suspicious, retiring, solitary persons were usually\r\npersecuted. Rough, irritable, egotistical individuals developed the\r\nquerulent forms and the over-conscientious eccentrics became the\r\nvictims of religious paranoia. He attaches a considerable importance\r\nto the influence of the unconscious or subconscious mind. \"Its\r\npredominance is shown in the dreamy, romantic, enthusiastic life of\r\nsuch individuals, and in the fact that accidental delusions occurring\r\nin sickness, dream pictures, and reminiscences from reading or plays,\r\nare elaborated in the depths of the soul, and early burst forth in\r\nthe form of imperative ideas and desultory primordial delusions,\r\nwhich become latent, but later find their ultimate evaluation in the\r\ndelusional ideas of the disease.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that Krafft-Ebing speaks of precipitating\r\nfactors as puberty, the climacteric, uterine disease and onanism.\r\nThere is a definite period of incubation followed by one of full\r\ndevelopment in which judgment and reason are lost. Hallucinations\r\nof hearing were found to be the more common form, followed in the\r\norder of their numerical occurrence by disturbances of sensibility,\r\nvision, taste and smell. Persecutory ideas, moreover, were said to be\r\nmuch more frequent than delusions of grandeur. The terminal states\r\nhe speaks of as mental enfeeblements with a prominence of emotional\r\ndulness, rather than intellectual defects. He divides the disease\r\ninto original paranoia and the later or acquired forms. Original\r\nparanoia begins before or at latest during puberty. Hereditary taint\r\nis always to be found. Conspicuous features are sentimental tendencies\r\ninclining to hypochondria, eroticism with sensitiveness and emotional\r\ninstability. Delusions as to parentage are common, suggested often\r\nby the fancied or real resemblance of the patient to pictures of\r\ndistinguished personages. Transitory ideas of persecution or grandeur\r\nare nearly always present. The erotic element is more frequent in\r\nfemales. Intermissions sometimes last for years. The termination is\r\noften found in confusional states. The classic or acquired form of the\r\ndisease develops later in life, often during the involution period. Two\r\nvarieties are described,—the persecutory and the expansive. Subsidiary\r\ntypes of the former are sexual paranoia, often with delusions of\r\njealousy, and querulous insanity with mania for lawsuits. The sexual\r\ncomplex he attributes largely to masturbation or enforced abstinence.\r\nThe expansive group is divided into inventive or reformatory paranoia,\r\nthe religious and the erotic varieties (erotomania). The acquired\r\nform as described by Krafft-Ebing is quite similar to the \"folie\r\nsystematisée\" of Magnan. It conforms, moreover, in a general way to\r\nthe views expressed in the English textbooks on delusional insanity\r\nand is the paranoia of Spitzka, Chapin, Berkley, Peterson and many\r\nother American psychiatrists. This conception of the psychosis was the\r\ngenerally accepted one for many years.\r\n\r\nThe institutional reports of that day showed large numbers of paranoics\r\nin some of the hospitals. It was a disease that played an important\r\npart in many murder trials and has received more attention from the\r\ncourts and newspapers than any other form of insanity, so-called, ever\r\ndescribed in the textbooks. There was a time, according to Kraepelin,\r\nwhen from seventy to eighty per cent of the patients in the German\r\nhospitals were diagnosed as cases of genuine paranoia. Certainly that\r\ncannot be said of the institutions of this country. In the New York\r\nstate hospitals, for instance, during a period of sixteen years, from\r\nOctober 1, 1888, to September 30, 1904, when the classical form of\r\nparanoia was officially recognized in statistics, 84,152 admissions\r\nwere reported. Of this number 1,655, or 1.9 per cent, were diagnosed\r\nas cases of paranoia. At the Matteawan State Hospital for the criminal\r\ninsane during this time 1,728 admissions were shown, with no cases of\r\nparanoia. At the Dannemora State Hospital for insane convicts during\r\nthe same period there were 354 admissions, sixteen, or 4.51 per cent,\r\nof which were paranoiacs. This is exceedingly interesting but extremely\r\ndifficult to explain. It is very hard to understand why no cases of\r\nparanoia reached Matteawan during a period of sixteen years. The\r\npercentage shown in the other institutions can be looked upon as being\r\nfairly representative of the incidence of paranoia as the disease was\r\nthen understood.\r\n\r\nThe decline and fall of the paranoia concept is to be attributed\r\nto Kraepelin. In 1893 his classification included hallucinatory and\r\ndepressive forms of \"Wahnsinn,\" both accompanied by persecutory ideas\r\nto a rather prominent degree, and paranoia proper, which he described\r\nas \"Verrücktheit.\" This was defined as the \"chronic development\r\nof a permanent delusional system with complete preservation of\r\nconsciousness\". In the sixth edition of his well-known textbook, which\r\nappeared in 1899, he enlarged the dementia praecox group previously\r\ndescribed by him and added hebephrenia and katatonia to it as well\r\nas describing a new and important \"paranoid\" form of that disease.\r\nHis own reasons for this were stated as follows[319]:—\"The second\r\nclinical group\" (dementia praecox, paranoid form) \"which I am inclined,\r\nprovisionally, to include under this head, is characterized by the\r\nfact that extravagant delusions, usually accompanied by numerous\r\nhallucinations, develop in a more coherent manner, and are maintained\r\nduring a series of years, either then entirely to disappear, or to\r\nbecome entirely confused. Hitherto I have reckoned these forms, as\r\n'phantastische Verrücktheit' to paranoia, as is the general practice.\r\nIt has, however, gradually become clearer to me that they are at all\r\nevents, more nearly allied to dementia praecox than to paranoia.\r\nWhether we really have to do in this case only with a clinical variety\r\nof the former disease or a distinct malady, the future must decide.\"\r\nHe did, however, at that time still recognize a small but well defined\r\ngroup of cases as genuine paranoia. \"On the other hand, there is,\r\nwithout doubt, a group of cases, in which it is clearly recognizable\r\nfrom the outset that a permanent, immovable system of delusions\r\nslowly develops, with entire preservation of mental clearness, and\r\nof the regulation of the course of thought. It is these forms for\r\nwhich I would reserve the appellation of paranoia. It is they which\r\nnecessarily lead to a profound transformation of the entire view of\r\nlife; to a dislocation of the point of view which the patient assumes\r\ntoward the persons and events of his environment.\" In the eighth\r\nedition of his book (1913) he separates out a considerable number\r\nof cases and places them in an entirely new group designated as\r\n\"paraphrenias.\"[320] This is \"a comparatively small group in which,\r\nin spite of many similarities to the manifestations of dementia\r\npraecox nevertheless on account of the much less marked development of\r\nemotional and volitional disturbances the inner structure of the mental\r\nlife is considerably less affected, or in which at least the loss of\r\ninner unity is essentially limited to certain intellectual functions.\r\nCommon to all of these clinical forms which cannot be sharply\r\ndifferentiated is the marked prominence of delusion formation and the\r\nparanoid colouring of the disease process. At the same time there are\r\nalso alterations in the disposition, but not until the last stages of\r\nthe disease that dulness and indifference which so often are the first\r\nindications of dementia praecox.\" In other words, we are dealing with a\r\ngroup which shows the paranoid features of dementia praecox but largely\r\nlacks its deteriorative processes. This is a very decided change of\r\nviews and may be looked upon either as establishing a definite status\r\nfor a large number of cases not properly accounted for in the past\r\nor as an indication of a tendency to return to former conceptions of\r\nparanoia.\r\n\r\nOf the paraphrenias as described by Kraepelin \"approximately one-half\r\nshow that slow but progressively developing mixture of delusions\r\nof persecution and grandeur which Magnan has described under the\r\ndesignation of 'délire chronique à évolution systematique.' Certainly\r\nthis disease of Magnan's, as far as can be determined from the\r\ndescriptions available, is not a clinical entity in the sense of the\r\nviews expressed here; we would unhesitatingly include with the paranoid\r\nforms of dementia praecox many of the cases, with well developed\r\nmannerisms and the coinage of new words, which progress rapidly to\r\nmental enfeeblement. At the same time, however, 'délire chronique' with\r\nits slowly progressing forms lasting for decades includes a number of\r\ncases which form the nucleus of the first paraphrenic disease group to\r\nbe described.\" Whether or not the paraphrenia of Kraepelin is accepted\r\nas having been established, it must be conceded that the question as to\r\nwhether anything remains of the original paranoia group is one worthy\r\nof serious consideration. Many have discarded the term entirely.\r\n\r\nKraepelin's paraphrenia is divided into the following\r\nforms:—systematica, expansiva, confabulans and phantastica. The\r\nsystematic type is characterized by \"the extremely insidious\r\ndevelopment of continuously progressing delusions of persecution, with\r\nthe later appearance of delusions of grandeur without deterioration of\r\nthe personality.\" The expansive form shows \"the prominent development\r\nof delusions of grandeur with a predominant exalted mood and mild\r\nexcitement.\" The confabulans variety is a small group \"distinguished by\r\nthe prominent rôle played by falsifications of memory.\" The phantastic\r\nform shows \"a marked development of phantastic, unsystematized,\r\nchangeable delusions.\" This was the paranoid dementia praecox of his\r\nsixth edition. Of the cases heretofore assigned to the paranoia group\r\nKraepelin has expressed the opinion that about forty per cent belong\r\nto dementia praecox. \"A further somewhat larger part falls to the\r\nparaphrenic forms to be described here.\" The practically negligible\r\nremainder he apparently concedes to genuine paranoia. In his eighth\r\nedition Kraepelin states that the latter constitute less than one\r\nper cent of all admissions. He now limits the term paranoia to cases\r\narising from purely internal causes and showing a slowly developing\r\npermanent system of delusions without any disturbance of thought,\r\nvolition or conduct. The delusional formations may be of various\r\ntypes,—persecution, jealousy, self-importance (great inventions, ideas\r\nof noble birth, etc.) or they may be of a religious or erotic nature.\r\nThe \"querulents\" he now classifies with the psychogenic disorders. His\r\npresent conception does not admit of the association of paranoia with\r\nhallucinations.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and important feature, perhaps, of Kraepelin's\r\npresentation is his insistence upon internal causes only as etiological\r\nfactors. He assumes a psychopathic foundation for the development of\r\nthe disease. In more than one half of his cases he found well marked\r\npersonal peculiarities. These were manifested in some instances in the\r\nform of irritability, excitability and abnormalities of conduct. Other\r\nindividuals were suspicious, unreliable, lacking in will power and\r\nover-ambitious. Homosexual tendencies were not infrequent. External\r\nfactors, such as unpleasant experiences, may influence the form of the\r\ndelusional expressions but should not be looked upon as explaining\r\ntheir origin. They develop in an emotional soil definitely related to\r\nthe hopes and fears of the healthy individual and are to be looked\r\nupon as a morbid transformation of perfectly normal mechanisms. In\r\naddition to this he speaks of an increased self-consciousness, a\r\nnatural tendency to resistiveness, an undeveloped type of thinking,\r\npsychological compensations for the disappointments of life, evidences\r\nof developmental inhibitions, improper habits of thought leading to\r\nmorbid conceptions, etc. He refers to exaggerated self-consciousness\r\nas the fundamental basis of paranoia. In this soil delusions develop\r\nas a result of inadequate intellectual processes due to developmental\r\ninhibitions. All of these views have been elaborated more fully in\r\nhis recent discussions of the subject of \"comparative psychiatry.\"[321]\r\nThese mechanisms, he says, have not escaped the notice of the Freudian\r\nschool. Kraepelin feels, however, that their arguments \"are not based\r\neither on a clear conception of paranoia or on any evidence at all\r\nacceptable.\"\r\n\r\nBleuler's theory of the disease is summed up in the following quotation\r\nfrom his \"Affectivität, Suggestibilität, Paranoia\"[322]:—\"The exact\r\nobservation of the objective and subjective relations at the time of\r\nthe origin of the disease shows us therefore nothing more than the\r\nappearance of errors, such as occur to normal persons under analogous\r\naffects and a connection of accidental occurrences to a thought\r\ncomplex which is kept continually awake by defects and his own trends\r\nof thought, just as it is in a corresponding normal mental process.\r\nThe pathological feature is only the fixation of the error so that it\r\nbecomes a delusion, and then the further extension of the delusions so\r\nthat it finally becomes paranoia.\" In 1906 when this was written he\r\nsuggested no explanation for the extension of such errors and their\r\nfixation in an actual psychosis. This might readily be interpreted as a\r\nlogical result of the paranoic \"constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe development of paranoic states was summarized by Meyer[323] as\r\nfollows:—\"A. Feeling of uneasiness, tendency to brooding, rumination\r\nand sensitiveness, with inability to correct the notions and to make\r\nconcessions—paranoic constitution and paranoic moods. B. Appearance\r\nof dominant notions, suspicious or ill balanced aims. C. False\r\ninterpretations with self-reference and tendency to systematization,\r\nwithout or with D. Retrospective or hallucinatory falsifications, etc.\r\nE. Megalomanic developments or deterioration or intercurrent acute\r\nepisodes. F. At any period antisocial and dangerous reactions may\r\nresult from the lack of adaptability and excessive assertion of the\r\nsidetracked personality.\"\r\n\r\nFreud sees in paranoia a reversion to the homosexuality of the\r\ndevelopmental period of the individual with a projection of symptoms\r\nresulting from mental conflicts due to a repression of complexes.\r\nHe described the sexuality of the infantile period as being purely\r\nautoerotic in character, the sexual interests of the child being\r\ncentered in its own body. From this stage the object of interest is\r\ngradually transferred to other individuals of the same sex, the normal\r\nattraction to the opposite sex being a final development of later\r\nyears. Freud believes that in paranoia there is a fixation in one of\r\nthese early transitional stages. \"Persons who cannot rise completely\r\nout of the stage of narcissism and are thus prematurely fixed or\r\narrested in the evolution of their dispositions, are exposed to the\r\ndanger that a flood of libido which finds no outlet, sexualizes their\r\nsocial tendencies and reverts the sublimations achieved in the course\r\nof the development.\"[324] The resulting mechanisms may be looked upon\r\nas defense reactions. The subconscious homosexual longings of the\r\nindividual are repressed but finally admitted to full consciousness\r\nin the form of a projection, the sexual object usually being accused\r\nof persecution, thus justifying the attitude of the paranoic towards\r\nthe cause of his troubles. In erotomania the antagonism is directed\r\nnot against the homosexual object but upon some person of the opposite\r\nsex. Freud interprets the delusions of jealousy of the alcoholic as an\r\nevidence of homosexual attraction, the individual justifying himself\r\nby the charge that it is his wife and not himself who is the guilty\r\none. The delusions of grandeur he looks upon as a sweeping denial\r\nof all extraneous influences, the individual building a defense for\r\nhimself by assuming a self-aggrandizement that leaves no room for\r\nhomosexual objects. Perhaps these mechanisms are, as Meyer suggests,\r\nonly another expression of the well recognized and more or less normal\r\ntendency to accuse others of being at fault in some way when what we do\r\nourselves goes wrong. Certainly, if nothing more, they are exceedingly\r\ningenious and interesting theories. One cannot but be impressed by the\r\nextraordinary skill of Freud in discovering the sexual origin of almost\r\nany mental process with which we are familiar. The ready facility with\r\nwhich his study of sexual conflicts and repressions can be shown to\r\nserve as a complement to the anatomical, symptomatic, and prognostic\r\nhypotheses of Kraepelin is also worthy of note.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, there is considerable question as to how\r\nmuch, if anything, remains of the old-time paranoia concept. The\r\nuncertainties attending diagnosis have given rise to the modifying\r\nterm \"paranoid\" which has been very generally used for many years. It\r\nshould be remembered that paranoia when at its best only constituted\r\napproximately two per cent of all psychoses reported from institutions.\r\nThese various considerations have resulted in its not having a\r\ndistinctive place in the classification adopted by the American\r\nPsychiatric Association and it has been given official recognition as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"From this group should be excluded the deteriorating paranoid states\r\nand paranoid states symptomatic of other mental disorders or of some\r\ndamaging factor such as alcohol, organic brain disease, etc.\r\n\r\n\"The group comprises cases which show clinically fixed suspicions,\r\npersecutory delusions, dominant ideas or grandiose trends logically\r\nelaborated and with due regard for reality after once a false\r\ninterpretation or premise has been accepted. Further characteristics\r\nare formally correct conduct, adequate emotional reactions, clearness\r\nand coherence of the train of thought.\"\r\n\r\nA study of the statistics of American hospitals shows quite clearly\r\nthe importance which should be attached to the paranoid conditions.\r\nDuring 1918 and 1919 there were 13,588 admissions to the thirteen New\r\nYork state hospitals. Two hundred and fifty-six, or 1.88 per cent, of\r\nthese were cases of paranoia or paranoid conditions. During a period\r\nof eight years there were 49,640 admissions of which 1,240, or 2.5\r\nper cent, were paranoid conditions. In Massachusetts sixty-four, or\r\n2.12 per cent, of the 3,011 admissions during 1919 were reported as\r\nparanoid conditions. In twenty-one hospitals in other states there\r\nwere 18,336 admissions. Of these, 789, or 4.3 per cent, were paranoid\r\nconditions. These statistics show quite a small admission rate for\r\nthese psychoses in New York and Massachusetts. The rate in other state\r\nhospitals is noticeably higher. As the percentage for dementia praecox\r\nis considerably lower in the reports from these institutions than it is\r\nin Massachusetts and New York, it is fairly reasonable to assume that\r\nmany cases shown as paranoid forms of dementia praecox in Massachusetts\r\nand New York are classified with the paranoid conditions in the other\r\nstates. If we consider the total admissions from all of the hospitals\r\nin question, we find 2,093 paranoid conditions in all, constituting\r\n2.94 per cent of a total of 70,987 cases. It has already been shown\r\nthat paranoia, at a time when it was a well recognized entity,\r\nconstituted only 1.9 per cent of over eighty-four thousand consecutive\r\nadmissions. This clinical grouping has, therefore, obviously been\r\nenlarged by adding paranoid conditions which could not probably be\r\nclassified as well recognized types of other psychoses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE EPILEPTIC PSYCHOSES\r\n\r\n\r\nAncient history contains numerous references to epilepsy. The \"Morbus\r\nsacer\" of the Romans was apparently a subject of great interest to\r\nHippocrates,[325] who wrote, over two thousand years ago, \"The sacred\r\ndisease appears to me to be no wise more divine nor more sacred than\r\nother diseases; but has a natural cause, from which it originates\r\nlike other affections. Men regard its nature and cause as divine from\r\nignorance and wonder, because it is not at all like other diseases.\"\r\nPresumably for a somewhat similar reason the disease was also referred\r\nto as the \"Morbus Sideratus,\" it being thought that those affected\r\nwere \"star struck\" or smitten in some mysterious and supernatural\r\nmanner. By others it has been suggested that the theory regarding the\r\ndivine origin of the disease was attributable to the seizures which\r\nalways preceded the prophesies of the priests of Apollo. Herodotus is\r\nresponsible for the statement that Cambyses, the king of the Persians,\r\nwas subject to the \"sacred disease\" from birth. Such historians as\r\nHippocrates and Euripides have definitely established the status\r\nof Hercules as a confirmed epileptic. \"Morbus Herculeus\" was one\r\nof the earliest designations of the disease. It was referred to by\r\nPlutarch in his writings. Suetonius describes the emperor Caligula\r\nas unquestionably afflicted with epilepsy. No less an authority than\r\nLombroso speaks of Napoleon, Molière, Julius Caesar, Petrarch, Peter\r\nthe Great, Mohammed, Händel, Swift, Richelieu, Charles V. Flaubert,\r\nDostoieffsky and St. Paul as all being victims of the same affection.\r\nTruly this is a noble assemblage,—one which might readily make the\r\ndisease fashionable!\r\n\r\nMaudsley (\"Body and Mind\") was convinced that Swedenborg suffered from\r\na form of epileptic insanity. The following quotation from his diary\r\nwould lend some color to that theory:—\"There happened to me something\r\nvery curious. I came into violent shudderings, as when Christ showed\r\nme His Divine Mercy. The one fit followed the other ten or fifteen\r\ntimes.\" After his fifty-fifth year, according to Maudsley, Swedenborg\r\nwas permanently insane. The historian Sloan in his \"Life of Napoleon\"\r\naccepts as an established fact the statement that this great military\r\nstrategist was an epileptic. Appian's \"Roman History\" certainly\r\njustifies Lombroso's reference to Julius Caesar: \"At length, whether he\r\nlost all hope, or else for the better preservation of his health, never\r\nmore afflicted with the falling sickness and sudden convulsions than\r\nwhen he lay idle, he resolved upon a far distant expedition against\r\nthe Gatae and the Parthians.\" Washington Irving in speaking of some\r\nof the peculiar experiences of Mohammed suggests that, \"Some of his\r\nadversaries attributed them to epilepsy.\" Even a very brief review of\r\nthe historical aspects of this disease should perhaps not omit the\r\ncontribution made by Shakespeare: \"My Lord is fallen into an Epilepsie.\r\nThis is his second Fit.\" (_Othello_)\r\n\r\nEpilepsy and the mental disturbances associated with it are so\r\nintimately related that they can hardly be considered separately.\r\nNotwithstanding that fact it must be admitted that there is no sharply\r\ncircumscribed clinical entity properly definable as epilepsy. Nor is\r\nthere anything distinctive about the psychotic manifestations occurring\r\nduring the course of that disease, although Tuke's Dictionary mentions\r\nover thirty different varieties. In the most exhaustive study of\r\nepilepsy ever made in this country Spratling[326] reported that memory\r\ndefects were noted in ninety per cent of the patients examined by him.\r\nIt should be borne in mind that the group studied did not include\r\nany committed mental cases. He found from eight to ten per cent so\r\nslightly affected as to be legally \"sane,\" \"except at the brief moment\r\nof attack.\" Fifty per cent were mentally incompetent with rational\r\nintervals and forty per cent were \"continually irresponsible.\" This\r\nlatter class included from twenty to twenty-five per cent of imbeciles\r\nand idiots and from fifteen to twenty per cent recognizable as insane\r\n\"by law and medicine alike.\" The prevalence of mental disease in a\r\nhospital population composed exclusively of epileptics is shown by his\r\nstatement that of 801 patients examined at Craig Colony forty-one could\r\nnot tell their own names; 166 did not know their age; 267 could not\r\nname the year, 263 the month, and 226 the day of the week; 238 did not\r\nknow where they were; 378 were unable to state the year of their birth,\r\n183 the last place of residence, 219 the name of the institution, and\r\n248 the length of time there; in addition to this, 224 could not write\r\nwell enough to sign their own names. It is interesting to note that\r\nthe disease had its onset in 38.5 per cent of his cases before the age\r\nof ten years, in 43.5 per cent between the ages of ten and twenty,\r\nand in 9.5 per cent between the ages of nineteen and twenty-nine.\r\nGowers found that seventy-six per cent developed symptoms before\r\nthe age of twenty. Spratling classified the mental conditions found\r\nin epileptics as follows:—Psychic epilepsy, epileptic automatism,\r\npre- and postparoxysmal mental disturbances, paroxysmal states\r\n(epileptic mania), and interparoxysmal conditions. The latter included\r\ntransitory ill-humor, slight dulling or clouding of the intellect,\r\nfeeblemindedness, imbecility, idiocy, epileptic dementia and acute\r\nconfusional insanity which he says belongs to the manic-depressive\r\ngroup. He warns against the danger of classifying as dementia\r\nconditions due entirely to the use of bromides.\r\n\r\nL. Pierce Clark[327] looks upon epilepsy as the logical development\r\nof a well defined individual make-up described as the \"epileptic\r\nconstitution\" and existing from the earliest childhood. In support\r\nof that theory he has reviewed the contributions of other writers on\r\nthis subject. He found that Vogt called attention to the epileptic\r\n\"poverty of ideas, prolonged reaction time, egocentricity, many\r\nreligious reactions and acts of servility.\" Jung referred to a series\r\nof superficial associations, influencing the ideas of the patient,\r\nsomewhat similar to those occurring in imbecility and sometimes\r\nobserved in normal individuals of the uneducated class. Roemer speaks\r\nof a disturbance of \"secondary identification\" involving memory\r\npictures with special sense recognition unimpaired. Eintinger described\r\nan essential poverty of affectivity and Wiersma, periodical variations\r\nin attentiveness. Ritterhaus defined the epileptic mental content\r\nas one of poverty of ideas, prolonged reaction time, egocentricity,\r\nemotional reactions and circumstantiality. Arndt included in the\r\nepileptic character peculiar inward fervor, characteristically\r\negotistic in nature, and resembling the alcoholic temperament. Bianchi\r\nbelieved that the disease developed on a personality basis strongly\r\nsuggesting the criminal type. He spoke of an inadaptability to the\r\nenvironment, the preponderance of individualistic instinct, cruelty,\r\nlaziness, evil life, precocious and excessive development of the sexual\r\ninstinct, irascibility and impulsiveness. Turner described an epileptic\r\n\"temperament.\" He found these individuals to be egotistical, conceited,\r\npretentious in conversation, emotionally unstable and sometimes\r\nobstinate or over-religious. Hartmann and di Gaspero noted as\r\nprodromal manifestations, abnormal changes of temper, excitability,\r\nanxious fears, sudden depressions, restlessness, irritability,\r\ndistrust, memory falsifications, and violent impulses. Voisin found\r\nthat less than ten per cent of epileptics showed a perfect balance\r\nin the emotional make-up. Hübner expressed the opinion that true\r\ndipsomania occurs chiefly in epileptics. He found alternations in the\r\ncharacter of the individual in from ninety to ninety-five per cent of\r\nhis cases.\r\n\r\nClark's[328] conclusions were summarized by him as follows:—\"1. There\r\nis more or less constant affective defect in all epileptics, sane as\r\nwell as insane; that such defect is due to an inherent make-up of the\r\npsyche in which mainly an egocentricity and a highly sensitized feeling\r\nare given to the individual; and that from this constitutional make-up\r\nor alteration the ultimate deterioration of the psyche, intellectually\r\nas well as emotionally, is gradually developed, step by step, and if\r\nthe state is not corrected that this finally and logically ends in\r\nso-called epileptic dementia. 2. The epileptic alteration is seen to\r\nproceed from the mental make-up or constitution of the individual\r\nepileptic long before his malady reaches the convulsive stage and that\r\nthe one is but a further and final unfoldment of the former.\" As Clark\r\nexpresses it, \"The nucleus of this personality defect is a temperament\r\nof extreme hypersensitiveness and egotism and all that these two\r\nmain characteristics entail ... a personality defect which makes its\r\npossessor incapable of social adaptation in its best setting and which,\r\nif it remains uncorrected, renders the individual inadequate to make a\r\nnormal adult life.\" He looks upon the epileptic reaction as a \"more or\r\nless direct outcome of the epileptic's inability to stand the stress\r\nand harassments of life from which he seeks automatic or unconscious\r\nwithdrawal.\" This exhibits itself as a loss of spontaneous interest,\r\nday-dreaming, lethargy, somnolence, etc., terminating finally in\r\nepileptiform attacks when the strain becomes too great. A rather\r\ncomplete description of the \"epileptic character\" appeared in Schüle's\r\n\"Klinische Psychiatrie\" in 1886.\r\n\r\nAn analysis of these mental mechanisms leads naturally to certain\r\ntherapeutic indications. In view of the history of the bromide\r\ntherapy, since the time of its introduction by Laycock as the ideal\r\nform of treatment in 1851, such suggestions should be given serious\r\nconsideration. Clark advocates the early use of educational methods in\r\ncorrecting the defects of the epileptic constitution. Thus he would\r\nobtain control of the egocentricity and hypersensitiveness by reducing\r\nenvironmental stresses, teaching adjustment to the surroundings, and\r\nfinding suitable and normal outlets for the spontaneous desires of the\r\nindividual. He is of the opinion that in the apparently deteriorated\r\ncases mental interests can be restored and emotional and mental\r\ndilapidation greatly improved. He has reported a series of cases\r\nshowing that the frequency and severity of seizure can be greatly\r\ninfluenced \"with the more or less permanent arrest of the disorder\r\nin not a few cases.\"[329] A subsequent study of the mental mechanisms\r\ninvolved was summarized by Clark[330] in these words: \"It is fairly\r\nobvious that the mental content in epilepsy proves that the epileptic\r\nregresses from the displeasurable difficulties of life, and in the\r\nfirst states of the fit the stress alone may be uncovered; whenever the\r\npatient reaches a deeper unconscious state, he gains the level of an\r\neasily recognized sexual striving.\"\r\n\r\nKraepelin[331] would differentiate between \"symptomatic\" forms of\r\nepilepsy due to organic diseases, injuries or growths; and the\r\n\"genuine\" variety not associated with any coarse brain lesion. He\r\ndescribes as indications of impending attacks, occurring several hours\r\nor even days before, headache, irritable ill-tempered moods, general\r\ndiscomfort, weakness, palpitations, oppression, anxiety, vertigo,\r\nnausea, hot and cold sensations, sense deceptions of various kinds,\r\nmuscular twitching, sexual excitement, disturbed sleep, unpleasant\r\ndreams, etc. Binswanger found these symptoms present usually in the\r\nseverer forms of the disease. Finkh found them in twenty-five per cent\r\nof his cases. Psychic, sensory, motor and vasomotor aura are described.\r\nKraepelin after discussing first the paroxysmal attacks occurring\r\nin the disease speaks of the various forms of psychic epilepsy as\r\nconstituting the second important group of clinical manifestations\r\nto be considered. These conditions may be looked upon as pre- or\r\npost-epileptic insanity, depending on their relation to convulsions, or\r\nmay be entirely independent of them or considered as equivalents.\r\n\r\nThe most common form of psychic epilepsy he describes as periodical\r\nill-humor. It begins sometimes with sexual excitement (Ducosté). The\r\npatient becomes moody, surly, irritable, quarrelsome, gives up his\r\nwork, refuses to eat and complains of everything around him. In some\r\ncases uneasiness, gloom or depression are manifested and suicidal\r\ntendencies may develop. Consciousness is clear although the patients\r\ncomplain that they cannot think or are confused and forgetful. Some\r\nhave headache, perspire, show dilated pupils, vasomotor disturbances,\r\nnausea, etc. The picture is often complicated by alcoholic indulgence\r\nwith attacks resembling dipsomania. This sometimes results in an\r\nepileptic clouded or dream state in which the patients become\r\nblustering, abusive, and violent or make senseless journeys. They may\r\nmanifest a sudden impulse to wander from place to place without any\r\napparent reason. Sexual excitement frequently occurs, with masturbation\r\nand exhibitionism, attacks on children or homosexual tendencies.\r\nUsually there is no recollection of these episodes. Occasionally\r\nexpansive or ecstatic moods appear and rarely a flight of ideas is\r\nnoted. These attacks of ill-humor usually last from a few hours to\r\nseveral days, often disappearing suddenly. Alcoholism always lengthens\r\nthe duration. In some cases active hallucinations and clouding of\r\nconsciousness occur. Dreams are common. Others show anxious states\r\nwith hallucinations and sometimes well marked delusions. An actual\r\ndelirium may appear, although usually only for a very short time.\r\nThe hallucinations and delusions may persist for months, suggesting\r\ndementia praecox.\r\n\r\nA second large group shows a more marked clouding of consciousness.\r\nThese are the characteristic twilight or dream states of epilepsy.\r\nThought is confused, desultory, retarded or incoherent. Sometimes there\r\nis a tendency to rhyme and repeat questions, or even a genuine flight\r\nof ideas. The mood may be depressed, anxious or irritable, although\r\necstatic states occur. The patient may become quiet, inaccessible,\r\nstuporous or cataleptic. Some, however, become excited. Later, defects\r\nof memory occur and amnesic periods may extend over a considerable\r\nlength of time. The patellar reflexes may be increased and the pupils\r\ndilated and sluggish. There may be a contraction of the field of vision\r\nor disturbance of color sense, tactile sensation, smell and taste,\r\nwith muscular weakness, Babinski reflexes, speech defects, dizziness,\r\nuncertain gait, nystagmus, etc. Somnambulism is sometimes encountered\r\nin epilepsy, although it is strongly suggestive of hysteria. The great\r\nmajority of cases present the picture of a simple dreamy stuporous\r\ncondition. Apprehension is clouded, the patients become confused,\r\ncannot control their thoughts, mistake the persons around them, lose\r\nthemselves on the street, and wander away. They destroy their clothes,\r\nundress in the street, etc. Sexual excitement, exhibitionism and\r\nmasturbation are common. Characteristic dream states may appear as\r\nequivalents.\r\n\r\nA delirious confusion with hallucinations and delusions often\r\ndevelops. Some cases have a very strong religious coloring and\r\nbelieve themselves to be in heaven or hell—hear the voice of God,\r\nangels, etc. Grandiose ideas may appear and wonderful adventures are\r\nnarrated. The mood is variable and may be either anxious, cheerful or\r\nerotic. There is a marked tendency to violence and the patients may\r\nbe very restless and agitated. Delusions are common and often lead to\r\nsuicidal attempts. Some exhibit an anxious delirium accompanied by\r\nnumerous hallucinations. The patient is clouded as well as disoriented\r\nand delusions develop early. Fabrications sometimes appear in this\r\ncondition. These deliria may last a few hours or several weeks.\r\nProfound and more or less long continued epileptic stupors may\r\ncomplicate the situation.\r\n\r\nA \"conscious delirium\" of longer duration is observed in some\r\ninstances. The sensorium is not so much clouded, and the patient\r\nappears quite clear. Hallucinations and illusions usually develop\r\nearly in the attack. Pleasurable, grandiose ideas often appear. The\r\nattitude in a general way resembles that of a confused disorientation.\r\nAnxious moods may develop, or rarely cheerful tendencies. Consciousness\r\nbecomes dreamy, with hallucinations of a religious coloring. Patients\r\nwith an apparently clear sensorium may commit numerous foolish or even\r\ncriminal acts without any apparent insight into their significance.\r\nSuch conditions as this may last weeks or months. Self-accusation may\r\noccur between attacks. These individuals are quite likely to start on\r\nabsolutely aimless journeys which may be the outcome of an alcoholic\r\ndebauch. The dream state in such cases may have a decided alcoholic\r\ncoloring with characteristic hallucinations or humorous tendencies.\r\nThis may be mixed with religious ecstatic manifestations. Dream states\r\nonly occur once or twice during the lifetime of an epileptic or may be\r\ncomparatively frequent. Many patients never have them.\r\n\r\nAschaffenburg found fainting attacks in seventy-four per cent,\r\nconvulsions in forty-two per cent, stupors in forty-four, petit mal\r\nin fifty-eight, dream states in thirty-six, and ill-humor in from\r\nsixty-four to seventy per cent of his cases. In his Munich clinic\r\nKraepelin studied 515 epileptics. Eighty-six and eight-tenths per\r\ncent of them had attacks of unconsciousness, probably often reported\r\nas convulsions, 23.3 per cent had dizzy spells, 9.7 per cent stupors,\r\n15.1 per cent petit mal, 3.3 per cent attacks of various kinds\r\nwithout unconsciousness, 16.5 per cent dream states, 1.9 per cent\r\nsomnambulisms, 36.9 per cent ill-humor, 13.8 per cent excitements,\r\nmostly alcoholic complications, and 2.5 per cent had status epilepticus.\r\n\r\nAn epileptic weakmindedness develops in many cases. The field of\r\nthought is contracted and egocentric in character with delayed\r\nassociations as shown by Jung. The patient is egotistical, interested\r\nin petty details, and strongly inclined to religious tendencies. He\r\nalways minimizes the severity of the disease which, in his opinion,\r\nis improving rapidly. He is likely to develop mild paranoid ideas and\r\nfeels that he has been mistreated or that others are prejudiced against\r\nhim. These individuals are usually moody, irritable, dull, emotionally\r\nunstable and excitable. They are often overactive but not industrious.\r\nMany show a persistent \"wanderlust.\" Werther reported that between\r\nseven and eight per cent of his cases were tramps or beggars. Quite\r\na few show criminal tendencies. They nearly always have a marked\r\nsusceptibility to alcohol which greatly aggravates their symptoms.\r\nKraepelin is inclined to look upon the epileptic personality as a\r\nresult of the disease and not the soil in which it develops.\r\n\r\nIn the more advanced deteriorations or epileptic dementias there is\r\na marked mental dulness with poverty of thought, loss of memory,\r\nirascibility and occasional violence. Kraepelin refers to a genuine\r\n\"epileptic physiognomy\" which is often observed. Strabismus, nystagmus,\r\nptosis, tremors and many other neurological symptoms are frequently\r\nfound. Clark and Scripture have described a characteristic \"voice\" in\r\nepilepsy. Besta found a subnormal temperature in sixty-six per cent of\r\nhis cases. Very elaborate studies of the blood have been reported from\r\ntime to time. The secretions and excretions have been made the subject\r\nof exhaustive research and the changes in metabolism have been gone\r\ninto thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe pathology of epilepsy has been given careful consideration by\r\nAlzheimer. In cases of status epilepticus he found extensive acute\r\nalterations, more particularly in the Betz cells, with swelling of\r\nthe neurones, crumbling of the Nissl bodies, and dislocation of the\r\nnucleus to the apex. Here and there the ganglion cells were entirely\r\ndestroyed and others showed regressive changes. Karyokinetic figures\r\nare seen in the glia cells, which are usually swollen, show ameboid\r\nchanges and contain degenerative products. Accumulations of broken\r\ndown cell products are found around the vessels. A sclerosis of the\r\ncornu ammonis, usually unilateral, was reported by Bourneville in\r\n14.8 per cent, by Pfleger in fifty-eight per cent, and by Alzheimer\r\nin from fifty to sixty per cent of the cases of epilepsy examined.\r\nThis consists of an atrophy of the cells in a well defined area and\r\ntheir replacement by a network of fibres. The cells are shrunken or\r\nentirely gone, while there is a great increase in the neuroglia\r\nelements with many free nuclei. The walls of the vessels are thickened\r\nand \"stäbchenzellen\" appear. The significance of these findings is not\r\nknown. Nissl looks upon them as only a part of a general involvement\r\nof the cortex. Widespread cell changes were frequently reported by\r\nboth Nissl and Alzheimer. A marked increase in the neuroglia has been\r\nfound particularly in the superficial layers of the cortex,—the\r\nso-called \"marginal gliosis\" of Chaslin. The vessels show an intimal\r\nproliferation and a thickening of the walls, with occasional mast-cells\r\nin the lymph spaces. Ranke has called attention to the presence or\r\npersistence of \"Cajal\" cells in the ordinarily cell free layers of the\r\ncortex. These are large transversely placed ganglion cells, common in\r\nthe superficial layers of the cortex of the newborn but not found in\r\nthe normal adult brain. This condition is looked upon as a cortical\r\ndevelopment defect. These so-called \"Cajal\" cells are also found in\r\nsome of the mental deficiencies. Nevertheless it must be conceded that\r\nthere are no definitely characteristic pathological changes so constant\r\nas to render certain the differentiation of this disease postmortem.\r\n\r\nNo forms of insanity perhaps are clinically so difficult and\r\nunsatisfactory from the standpoint of classification as are the\r\nepileptic psychoses. The various mental manifestations of the disease\r\nmay very logically be described as: 1. Pre-paroxysmal episodes, 2.\r\nParoxysmal states, 3. Post-paroxysmal episodes, 4. Inter-paroxysmal\r\nconditions to be specified, as excitements, depressions, anxieties,\r\nconfusion, stupor, dream states, paranoid conditions, etc., and 5.\r\nEpileptic deterioration. There is some question as to whether the\r\nvarious psychic epilepsies, so called, are sufficiently clear-cut to\r\nconstitute clinical entities.\r\n\r\nThe delimitation of these psychoses for statistical purposes is\r\ndescribed in the Association's manual as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"In addition to the epileptic deterioration, transitory psychoses\r\nmay occur which are usually characterized by a clouded mental state\r\nfollowed by an amnesia for external occurrences during the attack. (The\r\nhallucinatory and dream-like experiences of the patient during the\r\nattack may be vividly recalled.) Various automatic and secondary states\r\nof consciousness may occur.\r\n\r\n\"According to the most prominent clinical features the epileptic mental\r\ndisorders should therefore be specified as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"(a) Epileptic deterioration: A gradual development of mental\r\ndullness, slowness of association and thinking, impairment of memory,\r\nirritability or apathy.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Epileptic clouded states: Usually in the form of dazed reactions\r\nwith deep confusion, bewilderment and anxiety or excitements with\r\nhallucinations, fears and violent outbreaks; instead of fear there may\r\nbe ecstatic moods with religious exaltation.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Other epileptic types (to be specified).\"\r\n\r\nDuring a period of sixteen years in the New York state hospitals\r\n(ending October 1, 1888) 3,167 of 84,152 admissions were cases of\r\n\"epilepsy with insanity.\" This meant an admission rate of 3.76 per\r\ncent. It must be borne in mind, however, that the differentiation\r\nbetween epilepsy with insanity and psychoses clearly due to epilepsy\r\nwas not attempted at that time. During a subsequent period of\r\neight years in the same institutions, when what is essentially the\r\npresent classification was in use, the admission rate for epileptic\r\npsychoses was 2.42 per cent. In 1919 with 3,011 first admissions to\r\nthe Massachusetts state hospitals only fifty cases (1.66 per cent)\r\nwere reported as showing psychoses due to epilepsy. Six hundred and\r\ntwelve cases, constituting 3.33 per cent of 18,336 first admissions,\r\nwere reported by twenty-one hospitals in other states. An analysis\r\nof a total of 70,987 first admissions in forty-eight state hospitals\r\ntherefore showed that 1,865, or 2.62 per cent, were epileptic\r\npsychoses. After reading the statements contained in various textbooks\r\nregarding the extraordinary frequency of epileptiform seizures in\r\ndementia praecox, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that\r\nthe percentage of epileptics has been underestimated rather than\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHONEUROSES AND NEUROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words neurosis, psychosis and psychoneurosis are of obscure origin\r\nand have had a varied significance from time to time. Murray[332]\r\ndefines psychosis as a psychological term indicating \"a change in\r\nthe psychic state; an activity or movement of the psychic organism,\r\nas distinguished from neurosis\" which he speaks of as a \"change in\r\nthe nerve-cells of the brain prior to, and resulting in, psychic\r\nactivity.\" Huxley in discussing this subject in 1871 made the\r\nfollowing differentiation: \"In all intellectual operations we have to\r\ndistinguish two sets of successive changes—one in the physical basis\r\nof consciousness and the other in consciousness itself; one set which\r\nmay, and doubtless will, in course of time, be followed through all its\r\ncomplexities by the anatomist and the physicist, and one of which only\r\nthe man can have immediate knowledge. As it is very necessary to keep\r\na clear distinction between these two processes, let the one be called\r\nneurosis and the other psychosis.\"\r\n\r\nVon Feuchtersleben used the latter word in its present psychiatric\r\nsignificance in his \"Lehrbuch der Aertzlichen Seelenkunde\" in 1845.\r\nIts repeated appearance in the first volume of the _Allgemeine a\r\nZeitschrift für Psychiatrie_ in 1844 would strongly suggest a frequent\r\nuse of the term in the German psychiatry of that day. It was unknown\r\nin English works until quite recently, although the word is found in\r\nMaudsley's \"Responsibility in Mental Diseases\" (1874)—\"No wonder that\r\nthe criminal psychosis which is the mental side of the neurosis,\r\nis for the most part an intractable malady, punishment being of no\r\navail to produce reformation.\" Lewes, in \"The Problems of Life and\r\nMind\" published after his death in 1879, makes a very significant\r\nremark: \"Pathologists call it a psychosis, as if it were a lesion of\r\nthe unknown psyche.\" Clouston's 1911 edition makes no reference to\r\npsychoneuroses as such.\r\n\r\nThe word neurosis has been much more extensively employed in medical\r\nliterature. William Cullen, a well-known professor in the University\r\nof Edinburgh, in his \"First Lines of the Practice of Physic\" in\r\n1774, said: \"I propose to comprehend, under the title of neuroses,\r\nall those preternatural affections of sense or motion which are\r\nwithout pyrexia, as a part of the primary disease.\" In his \"Synopsis\r\nNosologicae Medicae\" in 1785 he divided diseases into four general\r\nclasses: Pyrexia or febrile diseases; neuroses or nervous diseases, as\r\nepilepsy; cachexiae or diseases resulting from bad habit of the body,\r\nas scurvy; and locales, or local disease, as cancer. Brachet,[333] who\r\nwas one of the earlier writers on the subject of hysteria, defined that\r\ndisease in the following words in 1847: \"Hysteria is a neurosis of the\r\ncerebral nervous system, which manifests itself more or less brusquely\r\nby crises of general chronic convulsions and by the sensation of a\r\nglobe ascending in the course of the oesophagus, at the upper extremity\r\nof which it becomes fixed, causing there a menace of suffocation.\"\r\nBriquet, another French writer, expressed somewhat similar views\r\nin 1859. The word neurosis as now used may be said to refer to a\r\nfunctional disturbance of the nervous system, which, if directly due to\r\netiological mental factors, is spoken of as a psychoneuroses.\r\n\r\nJust what diseases are to be included under the grouping of neuroses\r\nand psychoneuroses is another question. Practically all of the older\r\nauthorities, at least, have agreed on hysteria and neurasthenia.\r\nWhen we get beyond this point, however, there are wide differences\r\nof opinion. Oppenheim, in his second edition, under the heading of\r\nneuroses, included hysteria, hypnotism and hypnosis, neurasthenia,\r\nmorbid fears, imperative ideas, astasia-abasia, traumatic neuroses,\r\nhemicrania, headache, vertigo, epilepsy, eclampsia, chorea minor,\r\nHuntington's disease, paralysis agitans and many other conditions.\r\n\r\nKrafft-Ebing[334] was responsible for the following delimitation of the\r\npsychoneuroses, which he admits to be \"somewhat dogmatic\" and has\r\nused for many years largely for didactic purposes: \"1. Parasitic,\r\naccidentally acquired diseases in individuals whose cerebral functions\r\nwere previously normal and whose disease could not be foreseen. 2.\r\nDisease based upon temporary disposition (grave physical disease and\r\nthe simultaneous action of powerful exciting causes), hereditary\r\npredisposition not excluded, but only latently present in the brain\r\nof one easily affected, but previously normal in its functions. 3.\r\nTendency to cure of the disease and infrequency of relapses. 4. Slight\r\ntendency to transmission to descendants, and when it occurs, in benign\r\nforms (psychoneuroses). 5. Typic course of the disease picture. Mania,\r\nas a rule, arises from a melancholic initial stage; and so-called\r\nsecondary conditions are the terminations of primary conditions. The\r\ndisease picture, even when it appears, has a certain duration and\r\nindependence. The whole course of the disease is quite narrowly limited\r\nin time, and goes on either to recovery or dementia. 6. No tendency to\r\nperiodicity of the attacks or the grouping of symptoms. 7. Sanity and\r\ninsanity are sharply defined, and in striking contrast.\" In this group\r\nhe includes mania, melancholia, acute curable dementia and primary\r\nhallucinatory delirium. He describes hysteria, neurasthenia, etc.,\r\nunder the psychic degenerations with paranoia and speaks of them as\r\nconstitutional neuroses. His psychoneuroses certainly do not come\r\nwithin the general acceptation of the term at this time but represent\r\nthe views of a certain school of German writers.\r\n\r\nMore recently the words neurosis and psychoneurosis have been used as\r\nsynonymous terms by many writers. Kempf has even gone so far as to\r\nsuggest discarding the word psychosis completely. In any event, the\r\nview that we should only designate as psychoneuroses such functional\r\nconditions as are clearly due to psychic causes seems to be gaining\r\nground. The term neurosis is generally applied at this time to diseases\r\nprimarily physical rather than mental in their symptomatology. The\r\nprominence of psychogenic factors has been given great weight in recent\r\nliterature. In the second edition of his work on Psychiatry, Diefendorf\r\nmakes the following statement: \"Neuroses are commonly designated as\r\na group of diseases characterized by changing and transitory nervous\r\ndisturbances, to be distinguished from psychoses by the fact that the\r\nsymptoms do not involve the mental field. But in practice psychoses\r\nwithout nervous symptoms or neuroses without mental symptoms are not\r\nencountered.\"\r\n\r\nSince the term was first introduced by Morel in 1860, many French\r\nwriters, such as Régis and Magnan, have emphasized the importance of\r\nthe insanity of degeneracy. This included moral insanity, the sexual\r\nperversions and various other psychopathic conditions as well as\r\nthe obsessions, compulsions, impulsions, phobias, doubts, etc., now\r\nrecognized as psychogenic in origin and usually assigned collectively\r\nto the psychoneuroses under the designation of psychasthenia. In his\r\nsixth edition Kraepelin included both hysteria and epilepsy in his\r\ngroup of neuroses, while constitutional peculiarities of character, as\r\nwell as compulsive and impulsive insanity with sexual perversions,\r\nwere classified under the psychopathic states (degenerative insanity).\r\nIn his seventh edition epilepsy was described as a separate entity. In\r\nthe eighth edition we find a new grouping. The psychogenic conditions\r\nare divided into nervous exhaustion (neurasthenia), the dread neuroses,\r\ninduced insanity, the paranoid conditions of the deaf, the traumatic\r\nneuroses, the prison and the \"querulant\" psychoses. Hysteria now\r\nappears separately. Under the constitutional psychopathic disorders\r\nhe discusses nervousness, compulsion neuroses, impulsive insanity and\r\nthe sexual perversions. In view of these varying conceptions which are\r\nfairly representative of the literature of the day, we are certainly\r\non safe ground in confining a consideration of the psychoneuroses to\r\nhysteria, neurasthenia, psychasthenia and various other conditions\r\ncharacterized by anxiety and fears.\r\n\r\nHysteria has long been a subject of interest and controversy. It\r\nhas been a topic of discussion since the time of Esquirol and even\r\nSydenham. It was studied exhaustively by Brachet in 1847. Briquet\r\nin 1859 defined hysteria as \"an encephalic neurosis whose apparent\r\nphenomena consist principally in the perturbation of the vital actions\r\nwhich serve to manifest the affective sensations and passions.\" Lasègue\r\nwrote an elaborate treatise on the subject in 1864. It was discussed\r\nin detail later by Möbius, Charcot and many others. To Möbius hysteria\r\nwas \"a congenital morbid mental state where diseased bodily conditions\r\nare produced by ideas.\" During the last twenty or thirty years many new\r\nand interesting theories have been advanced. Binet sees in hysteria\r\na condition of double consciousness, the two states almost entirely\r\nindependent and separated by periods of amnesia. Janet's[335] interesting\r\nconception of the disease is covered in full in his definition:\r\n\"Hysteria is a mental disease belonging to the large group of the\r\ndiseases due to weakness, to cerebral exhaustion; it has only rather\r\nvague physical symptoms, consisting especially in a general diminution\r\nof nutrition; it is above all characterized by moral symptoms, the\r\nprincipal one being a weakness of the faculty of psychological\r\nsynthesis, an abulia, a contraction of the field of consciousness\r\nmanifesting itself in a particular way; a certain number of elementary\r\nphenomena, sensations and images, cease to be perceived and appear\r\nsuppressed by the personal perception; the result is a tendency\r\nto a complete and permanent division of the personality, to the\r\nformation of several groups independent of each other; these systems\r\nof psychological factors alternate, some in the wake of others, or\r\ncoexist; in fine, this lack of synthesis favors the formation of\r\ncertain parasitic ideas which develop completely and in isolation\r\nunder the shelter of the control of the personal consciousness\r\nand which manifest themselves by the most varied disturbances,\r\napparently only physical.\" He summarized this as a complete doubling\r\n(dédoublement—literally undoubling, as translated by Corson) of the\r\npersonality. On analysis there is fundamentally much in this view\r\nstrongly suggestive of the theories of Breuer and Freud.\r\n\r\nBabinski interprets hysteria as a purely psychic functional disturbance\r\ndue to suggestion. He would eliminate from this field all symptoms\r\nwhich cannot be induced by suggestion and relieved by methods of\r\npersuasion. The ordinary physical manifestations of the disease, such\r\nas anesthesia, hyperesthesia, paralyses, convulsions, etc., Babinski\r\ndescribes as stigmata. His theories lead him to suggest \"pithiatism\" as\r\nthe correct name for hysteria.\r\n\r\nA revolutionary and epochmaking contribution to the literature of\r\nthis important subject was the publication of their \"Studien über\r\nHysterie\" by Breuer and Freud in 1895. The latter has made various\r\nfurther expositions of his views more recently. What the ultimate\r\noutcome of the hysteria problem may be, only time can determine. No\r\nconsideration of the subject, however, is complete, nor should any\r\ndefinite conclusions be attempted, without a thorough understanding\r\nof theories which have a material bearing on the mental mechanisms\r\ninvolved in all of the psychoneuroses. Breuer and Freud advanced the\r\nsuggestion that hysteria is always the result of a psychic trauma.\r\nThe mechanisms involved may be very briefly summarized. Studies of\r\neveryday life show that the peculiar amnesia often observed for certain\r\nnames and events does not mean usually in the average individual a\r\nmere fading of memory with the lapse of time. Freud found that the\r\ninability to recall things in such cases is largely due to the fact\r\nthat they are for some reason or other unpleasant in nature and\r\ntherefore not desirable to remember. They are accordingly pushed into\r\nthe background as it were, by burying them in the subconscious strata\r\nof the mind and intentionally obliterating them from memory. When the\r\nordinary well balanced individual is confronted with an unpleasant\r\nsituation he meets it as best he can, by the exhibition of normal\r\nreactions of various sorts. He treats the matter lightly, dismisses\r\nit as a joke or \"laughs it off.\" His dignity may be maintained by a\r\ndisplay of anger or resentment. The mental equilibrium may be restored\r\nby a resort to profanity, tears, violence, or even physical flight.\r\nAn emotional outlet in the form of hate or thoughts of revenge may be\r\nnecessary to settle the question and finally dispose of it by \"getting\r\nit off the mind.\" There are unpleasant situations which for various\r\nreasons cannot be met and treated in this ordinary way. The mental\r\nshock of the \"psychic trauma\" may, for instance, be the result of an\r\noccurrence which is so distasteful and repulsive as to be incompatible\r\nwith the present existence. There being no other escape from such a\r\ndifficulty, it is rejected by the psychic censor, to use Freud's\r\nexpression, and repressed or forced into the subconscious. This is\r\nthe inadequate reaction which takes place in hysteria and leads to a\r\ndissociation and rudimentary splitting of the consciousness. Freud\r\nfinds that in practically every instance the repressed and painful\r\nidea is due to a psychic trauma resulting from some incident of a\r\nsexual nature; furthermore, that it usually dates back to the time of\r\nchildhood. These buried sexual complexes are completely disposed of by\r\nwhat Freud speaks of as the process of \"conversion,\" the associated\r\naffect being radiated, as it were, into the physical sphere where it is\r\nconverted into a memory symbol in the form of an hysterical symptom.\r\nThe mental symptoms of the disease he explains as the results of the\r\nelaboration and development of hypnoid states or erotic day-dreams of\r\nthe individual. Freud[336] summarized his views in a series of formulae\r\n\"which strive to progressively exhaust the nature of hysteria\" as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"1. The hysterical symptom is the memory symbol of certain efficacious\r\n(traumatic) impressions and experience.\r\n\r\n\"2. The hysterical symptom is the compensation by conversion for the\r\nassociative return of the traumatic experience.\r\n\r\n\"3. The hysterical symptom—like all other psychic formations—is the\r\nexpression of a wish realization.\r\n\r\n\"4. The hysterical symptom is the realization of an unconscious fancy\r\nserving as a wish fulfilment.\r\n\r\n\"5. The hysterical symptom serves as a sexual gratification, and\r\nrepresents a part of the sexual life of the individual (corresponding\r\nto one of the components of his sexual impulse).\r\n\r\n\"6. The hysterical symptom, in a fashion, corresponds to the return of\r\nthe sexual gratification which was real in infantile life but had been\r\nrepressed since then.\r\n\r\n\"7. The hysterical symptom results as a compromise between two\r\nopposing affects or impulse incitements, one of which strives to\r\nbring to realization a partial impulse, or a component of the sexual\r\nconstitution, while the other strives to suppress the same.\r\n\r\n\"8. The hysterical symptom may undertake the representation of diverse\r\nunconscious nonsexual incitements, but can not lack the sexual\r\nsignificance.\"\r\n\r\nThe practical application of these theories of Freud is illustrated\r\nby the line of treatment suggested. By his method of \"catharsis\" the\r\nrepressed and forgotten painful idea is restored to the conscious\r\nsphere of the mind and a normal reaction brought about by \"affording\r\nan outlet to the strangulated affect through speech.\" To accomplish\r\nthis result it is obviously necessary to find out what the psychic\r\ntrauma was that originally caused the repression. For this purpose he\r\nuses psychoanalysis, hypnosis and the study of dreams. Psychoanalysis\r\nis nothing more or less, as Campbell says, than a sort of \"scientific\r\nconfessional\", a complete analysis of the mental mechanisms of the\r\nindividual in a search for the buried complexes. It has largely been\r\npreferred by Freud to hypnosis, the latter often being impracticable\r\nfor various reasons. The association test of Sommer was very\r\nsuccessfully adapted to the determination and explanation of buried\r\ncomplexes by Jung. Freud's views as to the analysis of dreams in\r\nthe unravelling of mental mechanisms are set forth in full in his\r\n\"Traumdeutung\" (1900). He describes a dream as being \"the more or less\r\ndisguised fulfilment of a suppressed wish.\" Owing to the activities of\r\nthe psychic censor we may have either manifest or latent dreams. The\r\nformer are recalled on waking; the latter are distorted or forgotten\r\nand indicate the repressed wish. He classifies dreams as, those which\r\nrepresent an unexpressed wish as being fulfilled, those which represent\r\nthe realization of the wish in some entirely concealed form and those\r\nwhich represent it in a form insufficiently or partly concealed.\r\nFreud justified his emphasis of the sexual element in his studies of\r\nthe psychoneuroses by the publication of his \"Drei Abhandlungen zur\r\nSexualtheorie.\" In this he calls attention to the neglected importance\r\nof sexual factors in the developing mentality of the child and shows\r\nthat these influences are manifested long before the age of puberty.\r\nHe even maintains that the normal child is homosexual as well as\r\nincestuous at a certain stage. These erotic impulses are largely\r\nunconscious and become submerged, playing an important part later in\r\nthe development of the neuroses.\r\n\r\nKraepelin has devoted one hundred and sixty pages of his work on\r\npsychiatry to a consideration of the subject of hysteria. The mental\r\nsymptoms of the disease are all described as being definitely\r\nassociated with twilight or dream states (Dämmerzustände). These he\r\nrefers to as including somnambulisms, definite excitements, attacks\r\nassuming a characteristic silly or \"puerile\" form, confusions, deliria\r\nof various kinds, the Ganser complex, prison stupors and double\r\npersonalities (retrograde amnesia). He does not accept Freud's views as\r\nto the influence of the sexual life in the etiology of hysteria.\r\n\r\nNeurasthenia was first described by Beard of New York in 1880. As has\r\nalready been shown, it was referred to by Kraepelin as one of the\r\npsychogenic neuroses. Freud is much inclined to question the existence\r\nof such an entity as the classic neurasthenia described by Beard. He\r\nfeels that most of the cases can be traced to a definite association\r\nwith some other psychosis. He does, however, recognize a neurasthenic\r\ncomplex which is entirely sexual in origin and attributes it to the\r\nexcessive masturbation of adult life. The symptoms, according to Freud,\r\nare a result of the inadequate sexual relief afforded by the habit,\r\nand are those of nervous exhaustion, a sense of pressure or fulness in\r\nthe head, spinal irritation, hyperesthesias, paresthesias, diminished\r\nsexual power, and occasionally a mild form of emotional depression. He\r\nwould also differentiate another psychoneurosis of sexual origin—the\r\nanxiety neurosis (Angstneurose). He mentions an increased irritability\r\nas a prominent symptom often in the form of an oversensitiveness to\r\nnoises. The characteristic feature, however, is a state of anxious\r\nexpectation. This may manifest itself in a mere uneasiness and general\r\ntendency towards pessimism or may approach a state of hypochondriasis\r\nwith paresthesia and annoying somatic sensations. Fear of sudden death\r\nmay be experienced. There may be physical symptoms such as disturbed\r\nheart action (palpitation or tachycardia), disturbance of respiration\r\n(dyspnea or asthmatic attacks), profuse perspiration, periods of\r\ntrembling, dizziness, attacks of inordinate appetite, diarrhea, etc.\r\nNocturnal frights are common. The symptoms as outlined above are\r\naccompanied by a marked anxiety. He finds anxious psychoses usually\r\nin women, in the form of virginal fears in adults, the anxiety of\r\nthe newly married, similar states occurring in widows or intentional\r\nabstainers, and fears occurring at the climacterium. This condition\r\nin women he believes to be due as a rule to coitus interruptus or\r\nejaculatio praecox. Similar anxieties in men, according to Freud, are\r\ndue to abstinence, frustrated sexual excitement, coitus interruptus or\r\nsenile conditions. Masturbation may also be a factor. He also admits\r\nthat there are causes other than sexual, in the form of overwork,\r\nserious illnesses, etc. The mental mechanism involved is a \"deviation\r\nof the somatic sexual excitement from the psychic, and in the abnormal\r\nutilization of this excitement occasioned by the former.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1903 Janet formulated his conception of psychasthenia, describing\r\nit as a clinical entity. In this grouping he included the obsessions\r\nof doubt, phobias, imperative ideas, impulsive obsessions, compulsions\r\nand other conditions described by various authors. The essential\r\nmechanism to be considered, according to Janet, is a \"lowering of the\r\npsychological tension.\" This results, as White expresses it, in an\r\ninadequate perception of the realities of the outside world. Meyer has\r\nspoken of psychasthenia as \"a lowering of general interest and tendency\r\nto rumination over what is accessible to the patient in his memory,\r\nbut is not squarely met, and where the normal reaction is replaced\r\nby rumination, substitutive acts and panics.\" These conditions are\r\ndescribed by Freud as belonging to the \"Zwangsneurose\" or compulsion\r\nneuroses. The obsessing ideas force themselves into the consciousness\r\nof the individual, who is perfectly clear as to their inconsistency\r\nbut cannot escape them. These he also looks upon as being of sexual\r\norigin and due to repression as in hysteria. After the unpleasant\r\nidea is repressed, however, the mechanism is different. Instead of\r\nconverting the concept into a bodily symbol, a defense reaction\r\ndisplaces the affect from the painful thought, connecting it with some\r\nentirely disinterested and innocuous idea. This process he spoke of as\r\nsubstitution. This transference, as in hysteria, takes place in the\r\nsubconscious and is not recognized by the patient as having anything to\r\ndo with his peculiar symptoms. Compulsive ideas prevent the recurrence\r\nin thought, of the repressed etiological factor. It must be conceded\r\nthat these mechanisms are exceedingly interesting from a psychological\r\npoint of view. Freud's theories have, however, met with a great deal\r\nof opposition, due apparently to the fact that all of his conceptions\r\nare based almost exclusively on the influence of the sexual life on\r\nthe human mind. The characteristic and entirely consistent Freudian\r\nanswer to this objection is that it is a \"defense reaction.\" Without\r\nattempting to determine the exact basis of the psychoneuroses the\r\nfact remains that their importance from a psychiatric point of view\r\ncannot be questioned. They constitute in a large measure the field\r\nof observation covered by the out-patient clinics and psychopathic\r\nhospitals. They played an exceedingly important part in the psychiatry\r\nof the late war.\r\n\r\nLeaving out of consideration the mental mechanisms involved, the\r\nAmerican Psychiatric Association has endeavored to collect statistical\r\ndata relating to the various psychoneuroses generally recognized, as is\r\nshown by the suggestions regarding their delimitation, in the manual:—\r\n\r\n\"The psychoneurosis group includes those disorders in which mental\r\nforces or ideas of which the subject is either aware (conscious) or\r\nunaware (unconscious) bring about various mental and physical symptoms;\r\nin other words these disorders are essentially psychogenic in nature.\r\n\r\n\"The term neurosis is now generally used synonymously with\r\npsychoneurosis, although it has been applied to certain disorders in\r\nwhich, while the symptoms are both mental and physical, the primary\r\ncause is thought to be essentially physical. In most instances,\r\nhowever, both psychogenic and physical causes are operative and we can\r\nassign only a relative weight to the one or the other.\r\n\r\n\"The following types are sufficiently well defined clinically to be\r\nspecified:\r\n\r\n\"(a) Hysterical type: Episodic mental attacks in the form of delirium,\r\nstupor or dream states during which repressed wishes, mental conflicts\r\nor emotional experiences detached from ordinary consciousness break\r\nthrough and temporarily dominate the mind. The attack is followed by\r\npartial or complete amnesia. Various physical disturbances (sensory\r\nand motor) occur in hysteria, and these represent a conversion of the\r\naffect of the repressed disturbing complexes into bodily symptoms\r\nor, according to another formulation, there is a dissociation of\r\nconsciousness relating to some physical function.\r\n\r\n\"(b) Psychasthenic type: This includes the compulsive and obsessional\r\nneuroses of some writers. The main clinical characteristics are\r\nphobias, obsessions, morbid doubts and impulsions, feelings of\r\ninsufficiency, nervous tension and anxiety. Episodes of marked\r\ndepression and agitation may occur. There is no disturbance of\r\nconsciousness or amnesia as in hysteria.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Neurasthenic type: This should designate the fatigue neuroses in\r\nwhich physical as well as mental causes evidently figure; characterized\r\nessentially by mental and motor fatigability and irritability; also\r\nvarious hyperesthesias and paresthesias; hypochondriasis and varying\r\ndegrees of depression.\r\n\r\n\"(d) Anxiety neuroses: A clinical type in which morbid anxiety or fear\r\nis the most prominent feature. A general nervous irritability (or\r\nexcitability) is regularly associated with the anxious expectation or\r\ndread; in addition there are numerous physical symptoms which may be\r\nregarded as the bodily accompaniments of fear, particularly cardiac and\r\nvasomotor disturbances; the heart's action is increased, often there is\r\nirregularity and palpitation; there may be sweating, nausea, vomiting,\r\ndiarrhea, suffocative feelings, dizziness, trembling, shaking,\r\ndifficulty in locomotion, etc. Fluctuations occur in the intensity of\r\nthe symptoms, and acute exacerbations constituting the \"anxiety attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"(e) Other types.\"\r\n\r\nThe psychoneuroses occur very infrequently in institutions for mental\r\ndiseases. In 49,640 first admissions to the New York state hospitals\r\nduring a period of eight years, only 671 cases were reported as\r\nneuroses or psychoneuroses, constituting 1.35 per cent of the total.\r\nOf this number 29.97 per cent were of the hysterical type, 37.35\r\nof the psychasthenic, 30.27 of the neurasthenic form, and 2.41 per\r\ncent were anxiety psychoses. In the Massachusetts hospitals during\r\nthe year 1919, thirty-six, or 1.19 per cent, of the 3,011 admissions\r\nreported were neuroses or psychoneuroses. Of these, 44.83 per cent\r\nwere of the hysterical, 24.14 of the psychasthenic, and 18.39 per\r\ncent of the neurasthenic forms. On analyzing 18,336 admissions to\r\ntwenty-one hospitals in other states we find 297 cases of neurosis or\r\npsychoneuroses, 1.63 per cent of the total. Of these, 44.11 per cent\r\nwere cases of hysteria, 28.28 of psychasthenia, 22.90 of neurasthenia\r\nand 4.71 per cent of anxiety psychoses. The neuroses or psychoneuroses\r\nconstituted 1.42 per cent of over seventy thousand admissions to all\r\ninstitutions. Of the 1,048 psychoneuroses reported, 35.20 per cent were\r\ncases of hysteria, 33.68 of psychasthenia, 29.19 of neurasthenia, and\r\n3.91 per cent of anxiety psychoses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH PSYCHOPATHIC PERSONALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the term psychopathic personality is probably to be\r\nattributed to the description of \"Die Psychische Minderwertigkeiten\"\r\nby Koch in 1893. These were referred to by Morel[337] as \"Psychopathic\r\nDepreciations,\" a group in which he says Koch included \"a very large\r\nnumber of these psychical manifestations, so varied in their nature\r\nand intensity which, without belonging to the class of mental diseases\r\nproper, cannot, nevertheless, be reconciled with the idea of perfect\r\nmental sanity.\" These were described as being either congenital or\r\nacquired and including psychopathic predisposition, psychopathic\r\ndefect and degeneration. To congenital defects were attributed the\r\n\"Eccentrics, disequilebrated, overscrupulous and capricious persons,\r\nfoolish, misanthropes, redressers of wrong, reformers of society,\r\netc.\" In the degenerative processes he included mental deficiencies\r\nboth intellectual and moral. Meyer,[338] who based his conception of\r\n\"constitutional inferiority\" largely on the work of Koch, says that\r\nthe latter by \"Psychische Minderwertigkeiten\" \"meant those little\r\ndefects which constitute the inferiority of the individual in the whole\r\nstrife of life, that inferiority which does not allow him to come up\r\nto an actually efficient balance in the struggle of life.... They\r\nwere oddities, peculiar nicks in the personalities of the various\r\npeople, and he designated those as constitutionally inferior.\" Koch\r\nin this grouping unfortunately included hysteria, psychasthenia and\r\nneurasthenia. Meyer eliminated these: \"I wanted to do justice to the\r\nhysterias and psychasthenias which I could define as such, but I knew\r\nthere was a whole group of cases in which the definition could not\r\nbe pushed. I also knew that it was difficult to give the definition\r\nin the downward line towards imbecility, and since it was so very\r\nhard to give the definition in the individual cases, I thought that\r\nthe least trouble would arise from making a relatively large group\r\nof 'inferiorities not sufficiently differentiated' and let those be\r\nentered under the heading of 'constitutional inferiority.'\"\r\n\r\nThe original conception of this group was that it included intellectual\r\ndefects which have subsequently been classified with the mental\r\ndeficiencies, leaving only those cases showing purely psychopathic\r\ntaints of a constitutional origin. There have been numerous other\r\ndescriptions of these conditions. Ziehen[339] included under the\r\npsychopathic constitution \"chronic, psychopathic conditions, which\r\nin their symptomatology and course not only involve defect of the\r\naffectivity but also of the intelligence, even though pronounced\r\npsychopathic symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, etc., do not\r\nintrude for any extended period. Where hallucinations and analogous\r\nsymptoms do appear they are solitary and the patient retains insight\r\ninto the condition.\" Ziehen's psychopathic constitution covers a very\r\nwide field, including not only hysteria and neurasthenia but epilepsy.\r\n\r\nThe psychopathic personalities as described today represent only\r\na modern interpretation of conditions which have been given\r\nample consideration in the psychiatric literature of the past.\r\nAn early illustration of this fact is Pritchard's definition of\r\n\"moral insanity\" in 1835:—\"A morbid perversion of the feelings,\r\naffections and active powers, without any illusion or erroneous\r\nconviction impressed upon the understanding; it sometimes coexists\r\nwith an apparently unimpaired state of intellectual faculties.\"\r\nThe psychopathic states were undoubtedly fully covered in Morel's\r\ndescription of the insanity of degeneracy in 1860. This he divided\r\ninto cases arising from constitutional nervous temperaments, moral\r\ninsanity, the feebleminded with or without morbid impulses, and those\r\nwith criminal tendencies. This conception was well summarized by\r\nDiefendorf[340]:—\"The disharmony of the intellectual and the moral\r\nfaculties is one of the most striking features of degeneracy. As in\r\nthe defects of the intellectual development, so in the moral sphere,\r\nthe condition varies from a complete arrest of moral development to\r\nall forms of moral perversion and even to an abnormal development of\r\nthe moral and emotional susceptibility. All of these conditions may\r\nexist, with a perfect development of the intellectual faculties.... The\r\nprofessional criminals should also, without doubt, be included in this\r\nclass, as they present all possible varieties of moral perversions and\r\nanomalies, all of which may exist with preservation of the intellect\r\nand even with intellectual keenness.\"\r\n\r\nMagnan described compulsions, impulsions and contrary sexual instincts\r\nas episodes of the insanity of degeneracy. The psychopaths were\r\nundoubtedly the \"déséquilibrés\" or ill-balanced individuals of\r\nRégis,[341] whose work on \"Mental Medicine\" included an exceedingly\r\nelaborate discussion of the so-called \"borderline\" conditions.\r\n\"After maturity they are complex beings, heterogeneous, made up of\r\ndisproportioned elements, contradictory qualities and defects, and\r\nas over-endowed in some directions as they are deficient in others.\r\nIntellectually, they often possess in a very high degree, the faculties\r\nof imagination, of invention, and of expression, that is to say, the\r\ngifts of speech, the arts, and poetry; on the moral side, they possess\r\na singular emotivity, or rather, sensibility. What they lack, more or\r\nless completely, is good judgment, the moral sense, and especially\r\ncontinuity or logical consecutiveness, a unity of direction in\r\nintellectual production and the actions of life. It follows, that in\r\nspite of their often superior qualities, these persons are incapable\r\nof conducting themselves in a rational manner, of following regularly\r\nthe exercise of a profession that seems well beneath their capacity, of\r\nlooking after their interests or those of their families, of carrying\r\non business prosperously or of directing the education of their\r\nchildren; their existence, therefore, constantly recommencing, is one\r\nlong contradiction between the apparent wealth of means and poverty\r\nof results. They are the utopians, the theorists, the dreamers, who\r\nare enamored with the best things but accomplish nothing. The public\r\nwhich sees only the brilliant exterior looks upon these individuals as\r\nartists and superior beings. The medal is reversed, however, to those\r\nwho are compelled to associate with them and share their existence;\r\nthey see their defects, their incapacities and evil tendencies, of\r\nwhich they are not merely the witnesses, but also the victims. Aside\r\nfrom their lack of mental poise these individuals also display an\r\nexcessive emotional sensibility and an enfeeblement of psychic energy\r\nthat reveals itself by a noticeable predominance of spontaneity over\r\nreflection and volition. Hence their inability, their instability,\r\nand their irresolution; hence also their alternations of apathy and\r\nactivity, of excitement and torpor, their violent attacks of passion\r\nand their cries of despair for the most trivial and slightest reasons.\"\r\nRégis divided the \"psychic discordances\" or disharmonies into the\r\nill-balanced, the original and the eccentric. These were all included\r\nin the degeneracies of evolution. Clouston covers this same ground\r\nfully and in a somewhat similar manner in his \"Unsoundness of Mind\"\r\n(1911).\r\n\r\nThe insanities of degeneracy have also been given considerable space by\r\nsuch Italian writers as Lombroso, Bianchi, etc. Lombroso in \"The Man\r\nof Genius\" (1888) discussed this subject as follows:—\"A theory, which\r\nhas for some years flourished in the psychiatric world, admits that\r\na large proportion of mental and physical affections are the result\r\nof degeneration, of the action, that is, of heredity in the children\r\nof the inebriate, the syphilitic, the insane, the consumptive, etc.;\r\nor of accidental causes, such as lesions of the head or the action of\r\nmercury, which profoundly change the tissues, perpetuate neuroses or\r\nother diseases in the patient, and, which is worse, aggravate them in\r\nhis descendants, until the march of degeneration, constantly growing\r\nmore rapid and fatal, is only stopped by complete idiocy or sterility.\r\nAlienists have noted certain characteristics which very frequently,\r\nthough not constantly, accompany these fatal degenerations. Such are,\r\non the moral side, apathy, loss of moral sense, frequent tendencies\r\nto impulsiveness or doubt, psychical inequalities owing to the excess\r\nof some faculty (memory, aesthetic taste, etc.) or defect of other\r\nqualities (calculation, for example), exaggerated mutism or verbosity,\r\nmorbid vanity, excessive originality, and excessive preoccupation with\r\nself, the tendency to put mystical interpretations on the simplest\r\nfacts, the abuse of symbolism and of special words which are used as an\r\nalmost exclusive mode of expression.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other very elaborate works have been published on the subject\r\nof degeneracy. One of the better known of these perhaps is that of\r\nMax Nordau on \"Degeneration\" (1894). The book of Grasset[342] on the\r\n\"Demifous et Demiresponables\" has been translated into English and\r\nconstitutes one of our most valuable contributions on this subject.\r\nGrasset credits Trélat with making the first comprehensive study of the\r\nsemi-insane in his \"La Folie Lucide,\" etc., in 1861. His classification\r\nof these conditions included imbeciles, the feebleminded, satyrists,\r\nnymphomaniacs, monomaniacs, erotomaniacs, jealous individuals,\r\ndipsomaniacs, spendthrifts, adventurers, the conceited or boastful,\r\nevildoers, kleptomaniacs, suicides and the inert and lucid manias.\r\nGrasset gives some interesting illustrations of the psychopathic traits\r\nof various men of genius. Tolstoï fell sixteen feet as a result of\r\nattempting to fly when eight years old, and whipped himself with ropes\r\nto become accustomed to pain. In school he chose a course in Oriental\r\nlanguages because everyone else was interested in law. Not being able\r\nto finish a college career in two years, he decided to go to a desert\r\nand live a purely animal life. It was necessary for him to resort to\r\ndevices of various kinds to prevent suicide. Rousseau was at various\r\ntimes a clockmaker, music master, painter and servant in addition to\r\nstudying medicine, music, theology, and botany. He dedicated a pamphlet\r\n\"to all Frenchmen who were friends of justice\" and distributed it on\r\nthe streets. One of his acts was to write a letter \"to God Almighty\"\r\nand place it under the altar of Notre Dame. Persecutory ideas were\r\nentertained by him for years. Emile Zola was evidently a psychasthenic\r\nas well as a psychopath. He counted the gas jets on the street, the\r\nnumbers on the doors, and the cabs passing by. These were added\r\ntogether. \"For a long time the multiples of three seemed to him of\r\ngood omen, then the multiples of seven were reassuring.\" \"For a long\r\ntime he was afraid he would not succeed in any proceeding on which he\r\nwas about to enter if he did not leave the house with his left foot\r\nfirst.\" Balzac had an ambulatory mania and could not be found when\r\ncalled for military service. It is said that on one occasion \"when he\r\nhad put on a handsome new dressing gown he wanted to go out into the\r\nstreet with it on with a lamp in his hand to excite the admiration of\r\nthe public.\" His father is said to have stayed in bed for twenty years\r\nwithout any reason for so doing, suddenly resuming his former mode of\r\nlife at the end of that time. Schopenhauer broke a hotel proprietor's\r\narm because he heard him talking outside of his room. He refused to pay\r\na legitimate account because his name was spelled with two p's instead\r\nof one, on the bill. He often burned his beard instead of shaving and\r\nwrote his notes in Greek, Latin and Sanskrit for fear someone would\r\nread them. In his will he left all of his possessions to soldiers and\r\nto his dog. Goethe alternated between great joy and extreme depression\r\nand had unjustifiable attacks of anger. Frederick II had such a\r\ndislike for changing his coat that he had only two or three during the\r\ncourse of his life. When Schiller wanted to meditate he had a habit of\r\nputting his feet on ice and sniffing the aroma of fermenting apples.\r\nNordau says \"that Richard Wagner is accused of having a greater degree\r\nof degeneracy than all the degenerates that we have thus far seen\r\nput together.\" Mozart played the harpsichord at three years of age,\r\ncomposed concertos at five and made a concert tour at the age of six.\r\nHe was extremely nervous and fell in love at fifteen with a girl of\r\ntwenty-five. In the last months of his life he was obsessed with the\r\nidea that he had to prepare his own funeral mass. Lombroso's theory\r\nis that \"genius is a true degenerative psychosis, belonging to the\r\ngroup of moral insanities which may temporarily spring from other\r\npsychoses and take their form, but always conserving certain special\r\ncharacteristics which distinguish it from the others.\" Although his\r\nconclusions may not be warranted it must be admitted that many men of\r\ngenius have been psychopaths.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[343] in discussing the influence of heredity on psychoses and\r\npersonalities, says, \"Hence we may, perhaps, discriminate between\r\ncongenital states of disease and morbid personalities, according as the\r\ndisturbances are apparently the expression of the morbid conditions of\r\npast generations, or seem to be purely personal abnormalities, although\r\nit is certainly impossible to make any sharp distinction.\" In 1915, in\r\nthe fourth volume of his eighth edition, Kraepelin devoted nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty pages to the subject of psychopathic personalities.\r\nThese he divides into the excitable, the unstable, the impulsive,\r\nthe eccentric, the liars and swindlers, the antisocial or enemies of\r\nsociety, and the quarrelsome.\r\n\r\nA study of the \"excitable\" psychopaths in Kraepelin's[344] clinic\r\nshowed the intellectual standard of these individuals to be above the\r\naverage. Apprehension and judgment were unimpaired even when mental\r\ninferiority was not entirely lacking. Some complained of poor memory\r\nor absentmindedness, others of a feeling of fatigue. A definite mental\r\nactivity was noted, usually of a happy mood, but occasionally with\r\ndepressive tendencies. The characteristic feature was an emotional\r\nexcitement, associated often with violent rages, without any adequate\r\nreason. The emotional reaction changed quickly to one of despair,\r\nanxiety, irritability or inaccessibility. The mood in a large number of\r\ncases was depressed and tearful, while others were cheerful and elated,\r\nlaughing and joking, or erotic. Often without any apparent cause,\r\nirritability, pessimism, unsociability, weariness of life and thoughts\r\nof suicide appeared—more particularly during menstrual periods. The\r\nemotional state as a rule was kind, affable, good-natured, tractable,\r\noften religious, sensitive or sympathetic. The patients are often\r\nspoken of as well-liked, industrious, honest and substantial citizens.\r\nSome are timid, bashful or gloomy in disposition. Others are conceited,\r\noverbearing, tyrannical, rude, unsociable and quarrelsome. Many are\r\nchildish, foolish or eccentric, highstrung and affected or untruthful.\r\nSome are unsteady, restless and over-occupied, full of schemes, rash,\r\ntalkative, gossiping, and assuming striking mannerisms. Occasionally\r\nthey are disinclined to any regular occupation, neglect their work,\r\nloaf around and are supported by their relatives. In sixty-two per cent\r\nof these cases the patients were brought to the clinic on account of\r\nsuicidal tendencies. This was due to reduced circumstances in nearly\r\nfifty per cent of the men and in seventy-one per cent of the women. In\r\nthe men marital troubles and love affairs were more common; sometimes\r\nloss of position, or death in the family, etc. Spurious attempts at\r\nsuicide of a theatrical type were frequently reported. Next to suicidal\r\ninclinations as a cause for being brought to the clinic there were\r\nassaults, attacks of rage and outbursts of despair. In any stress or\r\nanger over a disagreeable occurrence these individuals are likely to\r\nbecome abusive, shout, scream, run around, strike the head against\r\nthe wall, tear their clothes off, pull out their hair, etc. Some\r\nrush around all night in the streets in a senseless rage, improperly\r\nclothed. Occasionally they attack others unjustifiably and for no\r\napparent reason. They are exceedingly susceptible to alcohol. During\r\ntheir excitements, consciousness may be clouded. Afterwards they say\r\nthey were confused, not themselves, in a dream as it were, etc. Some\r\nhave no recollection whatever as to what was done. These excitements\r\nrarely last more than a few hours. Thirty-two per cent of the men and\r\nless than ten per cent of the women were convicted of crime, usually\r\nfor disturbing the peace, or criminal assaults, but occasionally for\r\nmuch more serious offenses. As a rule alcohol is a factor in these\r\ncases. The relations between the sexes are characterized by jealousy\r\nand quarreling. The women are particularly likely to have delusions of\r\ninfidelity. Genuine hysterical attacks occur in a certain number of\r\ncases. They often see visions and may have dizzy spells or syncopes.\r\nSomnambulism may occur. Nervous symptoms often appear—headaches,\r\nunpleasant dreams, palpitations, tremors, increased reflexes,\r\ntics, etc. The excitable cases constituted nearly one-third of the\r\npsychopaths admitted at Kraepelin's clinic. Sixty per cent of these\r\nwere women. The majority of cases were between fifteen and twenty-five\r\nyears of age. Heredity appeared to be a factor in forty-seven per\r\ncent and many showed physical defects. Fifty per cent of the men were\r\nintemperate.\r\n\r\nThe \"unstable\" psychopaths are characterized by a dominating weakness\r\nof the will. In nearly one-half of the cases the intellectual\r\nendowment is normal, some having a surprising power of comprehension\r\nand ability to take up new things, with accurate observation of their\r\nsurroundings and keen discrimination. These persons have no great\r\npersistence and do not exert themselves, are inattentive, tire easily\r\nand are distractible. They never go into things deeply and have only a\r\nsuperficial knowledge of events. They learn readily and forget quickly.\r\nThe memory is poor and unreliable. The imagination is usually very\r\nactive, with a tendency to exaggerate, dream of the impossible and\r\nrelate great stories. There is an inclination to boast and fabricate,\r\ntelling of wonderful but wholly imaginary deeds and accomplishments.\r\nThey often represent themselves to be important personages. Some show\r\nartistic talent, write plays or fantastic poetry and discuss literary\r\nand dramatic problems. They are strongly inclined to become actors. The\r\nhigher intellectual development is uniformly defective. Comprehension\r\nis not clear and judgment is immature and short-sighted. Their\r\ninterests are devoted to frivolous matters without much attention to\r\nmore important questions. They sometimes show great prospects in school\r\nbut do not fulfill them later. The mood is cheerful and conceited, with\r\na very high opinion of themselves and great ambitions. They blame their\r\nrelatives for their lack of success and claim they are not understood\r\nor appreciated. Sometimes the emotional trend is more sad and gloomy.\r\nThey complain of being unlucky, everything goes wrong. Occasionally\r\nanxieties appear, with a feeling of oppression, fear of being alone, of\r\nmental troubles or suicide. These feelings are, however, superficial\r\nin character, usually disappearing in a short time, to be followed by\r\nexcitement, outbursts of anger or anxiety. They are often quarrelsome.\r\nThe characteristic disturbance, however, is that of the will. They are\r\nentirely lacking in the capacity to stick to any one occupation. They\r\nare not punctual, are interfered with in innumerable ways and often\r\nchange their work, looking for something more suitable. Hypochondriacal\r\nnotions hamper their activities. Senseless journeys and trips are often\r\nundertaken. Some become vagabonds and tramps. They are much inclined\r\nto bad company and resort to immoderate use of tea, coffee, drugs and\r\nalcohol. Sixty-four per cent of Kraepelin's male cases and twenty per\r\ncent of the women were intemperate. The sexual habits are very often\r\nirregular and venereal diseases to be expected. Kraepelin found either\r\ngonorrhea or syphilis in twenty-two per cent of the women examined.\r\nSome exhibited homosexual tendencies. Many become spendthrifts, making\r\nextravagant and foolish purchases. They are inclined to speculate\r\nunwisely. Fifty-four per cent of the men and nearly a third of the\r\nwomen as a result of their moral deterioration come into conflict\r\nwith the courts on account of thefts, assaults, quarrels, vagrancy,\r\netc. Suicidal tendencies were shown in forty-eight per cent of the\r\nmen and sixty-five per cent of the women in Kraepelin's clinic. In\r\nmany cases these were induced by alcoholism, in other instances by\r\nfamily quarrels, etc. Often the reasons given were foolish. Hysterical\r\nattacks appear in a certain percentage of cases in the women. Some had\r\nhallucinations and confusional attacks or syncopes. Tremors, headaches,\r\nincreased reflexes and other neurological symptoms occasionally\r\nappeared. The \"unstable\" group included about one-fifth of the\r\npsychopaths observed by Kraepelin. Thirty-six per cent of these were\r\nwomen. The majority of those admitted were between the ages of fifteen\r\nand twenty-five. Heredity was a factor in forty-nine per cent of the\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe \"impulsive\" psychopaths are characterized by a domination of\r\nthe conduct by emotional impulses. The intellectual makeup of these\r\nindividuals is usually good. They often have a special bent for art,\r\nmusic, poetry, etc. They frequently show a considerable mental activity\r\nand versatility. They express themselves well, make witty remarks and\r\nappear brilliant, although they may complain of absentmindedness or\r\nfatigability. They are always conceited, born to greater things and\r\nhave a great future. There is an almost unbounded egotism in some\r\ncases. The emotional tone is good-natured, easygoing and accessible.\r\nMany are sensitive and visionary; others obstinate, inconsiderate,\r\npretentious or quarrelsome. The mood is usually high-spirited and\r\nconfident but variable. The patients are often depressed and hopeless,\r\ncomplaining of their luck. At other times they are sullen, surly,\r\nirritable and faultfinding. Many exhibit suicidal tendencies. An\r\nemotional irritability is exceedingly common, with violent outbursts\r\nof anger. Often they refuse to associate with others for a time and\r\nwill speak to no one. The three common types are the spendthrift, the\r\nwanderer and the dipsomaniac. The spendthrifts usually indulge in\r\nalcohol and naturally soon contract enormous debts. They frequently\r\nhave little insight into their condition or blame someone else\r\nfor it. Many become wanderers and go aimlessly from one place to\r\nanother—wherever their inclination leads them. The memory for these\r\nevents is good. Some inadequate reason is always offered. These\r\nwanderers usually are children between the ages of ten and fifteen.\r\nThe impulsive alcoholics may have attacks very rarely, sometimes only\r\nonce a year. Debauches are preceded by restless and moody conduct.\r\nAfter constant drinking for days or weeks they sometimes have suicidal\r\nimpulses. Sexual excitements may occur. They always show psychopathic\r\ntraits between attacks. They are unsteady, unreliable, make sudden\r\nresolutions, change their occupations and residence and lead a wild\r\nexistence with surprising adventures. Some have hysterical attacks,\r\nfainting spells, or even convulsions. The impulsive psychopaths\r\nconstituted only two or three per cent of Kraepelin's cases.\r\nPractically all were over twenty-five years of age. There was a\r\nhereditary taint in seventy-one per cent of the cases.\r\n\r\nThe \"eccentric\" psychopaths are characterized by a lack of uniformity\r\nand consistency in the mental makeup. The intellectual endowment of\r\nthese individuals is usually normal. They are often absentminded,\r\nforgetful and show a variation in productivity. Some are artists\r\nor devote themselves to inventions. Judgment is impaired and\r\nreasoning becomes distorted and onesided. There is a tendency towards\r\nexaggeration and extravagance in their viewpoints, with a leaning\r\ntowards queer notions. They are often quickwitted, versatile and write\r\nlong and wordy documents. Their mode of expression is bombastic and\r\nlabored, and the content of speech or writing, verbose, desultory,\r\nflighty and full of meaningless expressions. They show a certain\r\nshrewdness and cunning, dissimulate, resort to all kinds of evasions,\r\nand are conspicuous in their conduct. Occasionally there is a tendency\r\ntowards delusional ideas of a mild form. As a rule the mood is\r\ncheerful, although often depressed, suspicious or irritable. They are\r\nopinionated, boastful and better than others. Usually there is an\r\nemotional excitability. The patients are sensitive and irritated by\r\nsmall things, scold and complain. Sometimes they are sentimental and\r\ndreamy, with extravagant language. They often take sudden dislikes to\r\nbrothers, sisters or other members of the family. They are capricious,\r\nquarrelsome, and faultfinding. Their conduct is aimless, contrary\r\nand incomprehensible. They lose all capacity for judgment of real\r\nconditions. They cannot proceed in any orderly way in things which they\r\nare really fitted for. They do not stick to anything long, changing\r\nplans and occupations frequently. They often go about at night talking,\r\narguing and drinking. It is not unusual for them to quarrel with\r\ntheir wives or even commit assaults. The majority of these eccentric\r\npsychopaths were men over thirty-five and of degenerate families. This\r\ngroup constitutes only a small number of cases.\r\n\r\nThe \"liars and swindlers\" are characterized by an excitability of\r\nthe imaginative faculties and a variable and uncertain will power.\r\nAt first these individuals are likely to appear as unusually gifted\r\npersons. They are good-natured, present an excellent appearance and are\r\napparently well informed on almost all subjects. They have a faculty\r\nfor quoting foreign languages and sometimes are familiar with many\r\ntongues. Often they are brilliant conversationalists. On investigation\r\ntheir actual knowledge is found to be very superficial. They are\r\ninclined to art, poetry and literature. Many become interested in\r\nhypnotism or spiritualism. They are inclined to join religious sects\r\nor attach themselves to the Salvation Army. These individuals learn\r\nquickly but do not stick to things long. Their mental powers are not\r\norderly or consistent. They have an extraordinary imagination but\r\naccomplish nothing. They are liars from birth, the falsifications\r\nusually being entirely useless. Many are anonymous letter writers.\r\nThey are often unable to discriminate, themselves, between the true\r\nand the false in their own stories. These fabrications appear to be\r\nan emotional product, the imaginary occurrence practically always\r\nrelating to the individual himself. They boast of their superiority in\r\nliterary and scientific accomplishments and claim to be theologians,\r\nmathematicians, jurists, chemists, etc. In their imaginations and\r\nfabrications the patients always better themselves. In many instances\r\nthey assume pretentious titles, represent themselves as counts,\r\nprinces, etc. Sometimes they strongly suggest paranoia. In a small\r\nnumber of cases self-accusations appear and they confess to all kinds\r\nof imaginary crimes. As a rule they are elated and optimistic, but\r\noften affected and theatrical. Occasionally suicidal attempts are\r\nmade. At times general depressions or anxious states appear. Some are\r\ncoarse and deceitful. They are usually uncertain and capricious in\r\neverything. Some become spendthrifts. They are naturally cheats and\r\nswindlers; occasionally thieves. The swindling schemes resorted to are\r\ninnumerable. The use of false names and assuming of uniforms and titles\r\nof various kinds is the most common. They make purchases of all kinds\r\nwithout any ability to pay or any intention of doing so. Many refuse\r\nto pay bills without any excuse whatever. Others attempt to marry rich\r\nwomen by deceitful means and misrepresentations. Some practice medicine\r\nwithout a license; others claim damages for imaginary injuries.\r\nSexual offenses are common. If arrested they are often inclined to\r\nclaim amnesia for the period of time when the act was committed. They\r\noccasionally have genuine psychoses and hysterical attacks. These\r\nsimulate various diseases. The group of liars and swindlers constituted\r\nfrom six to seven per cent of the psychopaths in Kraepelin's clinic.\r\nSeventy-one per cent of the men were accused of crimes. The majority\r\nof cases were under twenty-five years of age. Heredity was a very\r\nimportant factor.\r\n\r\nThe \"antisocial\" psychopaths or enemies of society are characterized\r\nby a blunting of the moral elements of their makeup and a lack of\r\nadjustment to their environment. Kraepelin found that forty per cent\r\nof his cases were persons who had done well in school. They have a\r\nstrong dislike for regular occupations and avoid them in every possible\r\nway. Their behavior is variable, with a tendency to be industrious\r\noccasionally and more often lazy. Frequently they appear queer,\r\nabstracted, inattentive, dreamy, sleepy or dull. When at their best\r\nthey are not bright mentally and have no ambition or far reaching\r\ninterest. They learn quickly and forget as rapidly. Their store of\r\nknowledge is very limited. They have no capacity for going into things\r\nthoroughly and cannot acquire a higher education. They are lacking\r\nin judgment, foresight and discrimination. Many have a weakness for\r\ncheap stories of adventure, pictures of crime, etc. In expression they\r\nare usually quick as well as verbose. A characteristic is their lack\r\nof truthfulness. They are liars and braggarts. The mood is usually\r\ncheerful and confident; sometimes arrogant, surly, moody, irritable and\r\noccasionally depressed or anxious. They change unexpectedly from one\r\nmood to the other. Irritability, with outbursts of anger, is common.\r\nThey often become threatening and destructive. Eighteen per cent of\r\nKraepelin's cases attempted suicide. At least one-third of these were\r\ntheatrical attempts on account of fear of punishment. Childish vanity\r\nand conceit is a very common symptom, with boastful tendencies. A\r\nprominent feature is the lack of any deep emotional reactions. They\r\ndo not react normally and properly to their surroundings. Another\r\ncharacteristic defect is their entire lack of sympathy for anyone else.\r\nThey are likely to be cruel to animals as well as persons. They show\r\nlittle affection for parents, children or relatives and are lacking\r\nin a sense of decency and personal cleanliness. As children they\r\nare exceedingly troublesome in school. Some have to go to custodial\r\ninstitutions for care. Many are truants at school and run away from\r\nhome, becoming wanderers and vagabonds. They are inclined to sexual\r\nexcitement, irregularities and crimes of various sorts. Seventy per\r\ncent of Kraepelin's cases were thieves, beginning to steal as children;\r\ntwenty per cent were embezzlers and twelve per cent guilty of fraud\r\nor forgery. Practically every variety of crime was represented. They\r\nexhibit an extraordinary tendency to revert to criminal habits. Prison\r\nlife makes some submissive but starts others in a war against society.\r\nThey often attempt violence or make passive resistance to the law. They\r\noccasionally develop hypochondriacal tendencies. Friendly advances are\r\ngreeted with mistrust. Some are stubborn, sulky, unrepentant and have\r\nnothing to say, or lie and explain by putting the blame on others. Thus\r\nan opposition to all organized society develops. They often look upon\r\nthemselves as martyrs. Others take the situation lightly and minimize\r\nthe gravity of their position. Some seem to really see the error of\r\ntheir ways. The antisocial individuals sooner or later, like other\r\npsychopaths, are very prone to hysterical attacks, fainting spells,\r\nor even convulsions. Anesthesias and hyperesthesias may be noted.\r\nSome patients complain of headache, disturbed sleep, dreams, etc. The\r\nantisocial in Kraepelin's clinic constituted less than ten per cent of\r\nthe psychopaths, of which seventy per cent were men. Half of the women\r\nwere prostitutes. Over eighty per cent of the cases were under twenty\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual makeup of the \"quarrelsome\" psychopath is usually\r\nfairly good. As a rule these persons show a narrowing of the\r\nintellectual sphere, with, however, a well-defined shrewdness which\r\nenables them to take advantage of others. Some show a tendency to\r\npedantry and hair-splitting arguments. Memory is good but distorted\r\nby an emotional coloring. Judgment is warped and unreliable. They\r\nare credulous and accept statements without proof, but they look\r\nwith suspicion on anything not in accord with their own ideas. The\r\ninfluence of these factors leads to an emotional excitability. They\r\nare always passionate, sensitive individuals who become excited over\r\ntrivial matters. This is complicated by a marked self-confidence,\r\nminimizing their own failings. Quarrels are the inevitable consequence.\r\nEverything is exaggerated in importance. The conclusion is reached that\r\nthe neighbors and others are all organized against them. Sometimes\r\nthe feeling of enmity is transferred from one individual to another.\r\nThe patient is constantly in trouble with someone. They are almost\r\ninvariably of the male sex and usually of middle age or older when they\r\ncome under observation.\r\n\r\nFor statistical purposes the differentiation of the psychopathic\r\npersonalities has been described by the Association's committee as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n\"Under the designation of psychopathic personality is brought together\r\na large group of pathological personalities whose abnormality of makeup\r\nis expressed mainly in the character and intensity of their emotional\r\nand volitional reactions. To meet the demands of current usage, the\r\nterm for this group has been shortened from the older one \"psychoses\r\nwith constitutional psychopathic inferiority\" with which it is\r\nsynonymous. Individuals with an intellectual defect (feeblemindedness)\r\nare not to be included in this group.\r\n\r\n\"Several of the preceding groups, in fact all of the so-called\r\nconstitutional psychoses, manic-depressive, dementia praecox, paranoia,\r\npsychoneuroses, etc., may be considered as arising on a basis of\r\npsychopathic inferiority or constitution because the previous mental\r\nmakeup in these conditions shows more or less clearly abnormalities in\r\nthe emotional and volitional spheres. These reactions are apparently\r\nrelated to special forms of psychopathic makeup now fairly well\r\ndifferentiated, and the associated psychoses also have their own\r\ndistinctive features.\r\n\r\n\"There remain, however, various other less well differentiated types\r\nof psychopathic personalities, and in these the psychotic reactions\r\n(psychoses) also differ from those already specified in the preceding\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n\"It is these less well differentiated types of emotional and volitional\r\ndeviation which are to be designated, at least for statistical\r\npurposes, as psychopathic personality. The type of behavior disorder,\r\nthe social reactions, the trends of interests, etc., which psychopathic\r\npersonalities may show give special features to many cases, _e.g._,\r\ncriminal traits, moral deficiency, tramp life, sexual perversions and\r\nvarious temperamental peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\"The pronounced mental disturbances or psychoses which develop in\r\npsychopathic personalities and bring about their commitment are varied\r\nin their clinical form and are usually of an episodic character. Most\r\nfrequent are attacks of irritability, excitement, depression, paranoid\r\nepisodes, transient confused states, etc. True prison psychoses belong\r\nin this group.\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with the standpoint developed above, a psychopathic\r\npersonality with a manic-depressive attack should be classed in the\r\nmanic-depressive group, and likewise a psychopathic personality with a\r\nschizophrenic psychosis should go in the dementia praecox group.\r\n\r\n\"Psychopathic personalities without an episodic mental attack or any\r\npsychotic symptoms should be placed in the _without psychosis_ group\r\nunder the appropriate subheading.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there are no statistics which show the incidence of\r\npsychopathic personalities in the community. A study of 70,987 first\r\nadmissions to state hospitals shows that the psychoses associated with\r\nthis condition constituted only 1.12 per cent of the total number. On\r\nthe other hand, the reports of the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic show an\r\nadmission rate for psychopaths of over six per cent during a five-year\r\nperiod. When they reach a state hospital it is usually owing to the\r\ndevelopment of manic-depressive insanity or some other well-defined\r\npsychosis. The important and troublesome cases from a social point of\r\nview are those that do not reach hospitals. A much larger percentage is\r\nto be found in institutions of the correctional and penal type. There\r\nis no greater problem today than the attitude of the state towards\r\nthe psychopathic criminal. The influence of these individuals on the\r\ncommunity at large is something that we have no means of estimating at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PSYCHOSES WITH MENTAL DEFICIENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe literature of mental deficiency is almost as old as that of\r\nmedicine. Imbecility was studied at some length by Plato and Galen\r\nand was recognized by Felix Plater, who has been accredited with the\r\nfirst classification of mental diseases known (seventeenth century).\r\nFitzherbert[345] in his \"Natura Brevium\" in 1652 included the following\r\ninteresting definition of idiocy: \"He that shall be said to be a sot\r\nand idiot from his birth, is such a person who cannot count or number\r\ntwenty pence, nor tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is,\r\nso as it may appear that he hath no understanding or reason what shall\r\nbe for his profit, or what for his loss; but, if he have sufficient\r\nunderstanding to know and understand his letters, and to read by\r\nteaching or information, then it seems he is not an idiot.\" One of\r\nthe first medical writers to discuss mental defects at any length was\r\nEsquirol. In differentiating them from mental diseases he said: \"Idiocy\r\nis not a disease, but a condition in which the intellectual faculties\r\nare never manifested; or have never been developed sufficiently to\r\nenable the idiot to acquire such an amount of knowledge as persons of\r\nhis own age, and placed in similar circumstances with himself, are\r\ncapable of receiving. Idiocy commences with life, or at that age which\r\nprecedes the development of the intellectual and affective faculties,\r\nwhich are from the first, what they are doomed to be during the whole\r\nperiod of existence.\" ... \"A man in a state of Dementia is deprived\r\nof advantages which he formerly enjoyed. He was a rich man, who has\r\nbecome poor. The idiot, on the contrary, has always been in a state of\r\nwant and misery.\" An elaborate treatise on the subject of cretinism was\r\npublished by Fodéré in 1792.\r\n\r\nTredgold,[346] in discussing the etiology of mental deficiency, divides\r\nthe causes into factors indicative of, or producing, a variation of the\r\ngerm plasm and those acting directly upon the offspring. The former\r\ninclude neuropathic inheritance, alcoholism, tuberculosis, syphilis,\r\nconsanguinity and the age of the parents. Among the latter are abnormal\r\nmental and physical conditions of the mother during pregnancy, or\r\ninjury to the fœtus; abnormalities of labor, primogeniture and\r\npremature delivery; and after birth—traumatic, toxic, convulsive and\r\nnutritional factors. He found neuropathic inheritance in over eighty\r\nper cent of the cases studied. In 64.5 per cent the heredity took\r\nthe form of mental defects, insanity or epilepsy, and in eighteen\r\nper cent paralysis, cerebral hemorrhage, neuroses of various kinds,\r\nor psychoses. There was a history of alcoholism in 46.5 per cent of\r\nthe series investigated. Tuberculosis occurred in the families of\r\nthirty-four per cent, syphilis in 2.5 per cent, consanguinity in five\r\nper cent, and a marked disparity in the ages of the parents in four\r\nper cent. Factors acting directly on the offspring, either before,\r\nduring or after birth, were found to be present in sixty-five per cent.\r\nGoddard[347] in a study of 327 cases found a history of inherited mental\r\ndeficiency in fifty-four per cent, probable heredity in 11.3 per cent,\r\nneuropathic ancestry in twelve per cent, accidents of various kinds in\r\nnineteen per cent, and no ascertainable cause of any kind in 2.6 per\r\ncent of the total number.\r\n\r\nThe definition of a feebleminded person, proposed by the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians of London, and subsequently adopted by the\r\nEnglish Royal Commission, reads as follows:—\"One who is capable of\r\nearning a living under favorable circumstances, but is incapable,\r\nfrom mental defect existing from birth, or from an early age, (a) of\r\ncompeting on equal terms with his normal fellows; or (b) of managing\r\nhimself and his affairs with ordinary prudence.\" The English Mental\r\nDeficiency Act of 1913 included the following definition:—\"Persons\r\nin whose case there exists from birth or from an early age mental\r\ndefectiveness not amounting to imbecility, yet so pronounced that\r\nthey require care, supervision, and control for their own protection\r\nor for the protection of others, or, in the case of children, that\r\nthey, by reason of such defectiveness, appear to be permanently\r\nincapable of receiving proper benefit from the instruction in ordinary\r\nschools.\" It will be noted that imbeciles and idiots do not come\r\nwithin the scope of these definitions. This is due to the fact that\r\nthe term feeblemindedness as used in England includes only the High\r\nGrade Amentia of Tredgold or the Morons as defined by Goddard. The\r\nclassification of the latter is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. High Grade Morons—Those that can do fairly complicated work, with\r\nonly occasional or no supervision, run simple machinery or take care of\r\nanimals, but are unable to plan.\r\n\r\n2. Middle Grade—Those capable of doing routine institution work only.\r\n\r\n3. Low Grade—Those who are only capable of running errands, doing\r\nlight work, making beds, scrubbing or caring for rooms—if there is no\r\ngreat complexity of furniture.\r\n\r\nTredgold describes imbecility as Medium Grade Amentia and idiocy as Low\r\nGrade Amentia.\r\n\r\nThe Mental Deficiency Act of England defines idiots as \"persons so\r\ndeeply defective in mind from birth, or from an early age, as to be\r\nunable to guard themselves against common physical dangers.\" It also\r\nrefers to moral imbeciles as \"persons who from an early age display\r\nsome permanent mental defect coupled with strong vicious or criminal\r\npropensities on which punishment has had little or no deterrent\r\neffect.\" The imbecile as defined by the Royal Commission of England\r\nis \"one who by reason of mental defect existing from birth or from an\r\nearly age is incapable of earning his own living, but is capable of\r\nguarding himself against common physical dangers.\"\r\n\r\nTredgold classifies either feeblemindedness, imbecility or idiocy\r\nif due to pathological germinal variations (caused by alcoholism,\r\ntuberculosis, syphilis, etc., and manifested by amentia, insanity,\r\nepilepsy, etc.) as being either simple, microcephalic, or Mongolian.\r\nHe describes those which represent somatic modifications due to\r\ngross cerebral lesions as syphilitic, amaurotic, hydrocephalic,\r\nporencephalic, sclerotic, paralytic and other toxic, inflammatory or\r\nvascular forms. The somatic modifications due to defective cerebral\r\nnutrition he divides into epilepsy, cretinism, nutritional forms and\r\nisolation (sense deprivation).\r\n\r\nThe classification of mental defects used by Fernald at the\r\nMassachusetts School for the Feebleminded and based on mental ages\r\nis as follows:—Idiot,—low grade, less than one year; middle grade,\r\none year or more; high grade, two years. Imbecile,—low grade, three\r\nand four years; middle grade, five years; high grade, six and seven\r\nyears. Moron,—low grade, eight and nine years; middle grade, ten\r\nyears; high grade, eleven and twelve years. Fernald calls attention\r\nto the fact that the diagnosis cannot be based on the mental age\r\nalone. The intelligence quotient must be taken into consideration.\r\nThis is determined by dividing the mental by the physical age. It is a\r\ncomparison of the average intelligence of the child, using the normal\r\nas a standard. The diagnosis cannot be definitely made until the age of\r\nsixteen, or until the probable mental age at sixteen is determined.\r\n\r\nThe following definitions are used by the American Association for\r\nthe Study of the Feebleminded:—\"An idiot is a mentally defective\r\nperson having a mental age of not more than 35 months, or, if a child,\r\nan intelligence quotient of less than 25. An imbecile is a mentally\r\ndefective person having a mental age between 36 months and 83 months\r\ninclusive, or, if a child, an intelligence quotient between 25 and 49.\r\nA moron is a mentally defective person having a mental age between\r\n84 months and 144 months inclusive, or, if a child, an intelligence\r\nquotient between 50 and 74.\"\r\n\r\nTredgold expresses the opinion that \"the insanity of the feebleminded\r\nand high grade imbeciles does not, on the whole, differ from that\r\noccurring in ordinary persons.\" In sixty-two cases under his\r\nobservation he found the following forms:—Mania, thirty-two;\r\nmelancholia, sixteen; alternating mania and melancholia, six; stupor,\r\none; delusional insanity, one; and juvenile general paresis, six. He\r\nalso speaks of epileptic insanity and terminal dementia in his cases.\r\n\r\nKraepelin[348] describes certain characteristics as applying very\r\ngenerally to the mental deficiency group which he prefers to speak\r\nof as \"Oligophrenia.\" Sense perception is often interfered with\r\nby defective vision, opacities of the lens and cornea, errors of\r\nrefraction, optic atrophy or deafness. The apprehension of external\r\nimpressions may be prevented to a certain extent also by disturbances\r\nof attention. Only the sharper and stronger stimuli reach the patients\r\nas a rule and these impressions are retarded. Many occurrences escape\r\ntheir notice entirely and their sense perceptions are poor and scanty\r\nat best. Disturbances of attention are shown by the attitude, facial\r\nexpression, carriage and conduct, so that they have an appearance\r\nof apathy and indifference when their real feelings are entirely\r\ndifferent. An increased effort cannot be produced by an exertion of the\r\nwill, nor can the fatigue which such attempts result in, be overcome.\r\nRepeated tests of various kinds show a marked decrease in the power\r\nof apprehension. In profound idiocy it is difficult to determine\r\nwhether any impression can be made on the sense organs or not. When the\r\npatients react to a severe pin prick it is only after a considerable\r\ndelay, apprehension and attention being equally impaired. Schlesinger\r\nfound fifty-five per cent of his cases lacking in interest, thirty-five\r\nper cent were distractible and ten per cent showed an increased\r\nfatigability. An evidence of the lack of attention is the fact that the\r\nweakminded as a rule are not susceptible to hypnotism.\r\n\r\nThe apprehension of colors, form and dimensions is uncertain and\r\ndifficult. The patients learn to distinguish colors very late usually.\r\nThey can form no clear conception as to the outlines, surface or\r\ncontents of objects. They have considerable difficulty in putting\r\nsyllables and sentences together. They recognize the details but\r\nnot the significance of pictures. In the elaboration of impressions\r\nthey are unable to distinguish between the real and the accidental\r\nor nonessential. This gives rise to a confusion of ideas. Changes in\r\nsize, color, shape, etc, always annoy them. Their lack of observation\r\nand discrimination explains the absence of timidity in the presence\r\nof strangers which characterizes normal children. There is also a\r\ndefective apprehension of auditory impressions and they are unable to\r\nunderstand very familiar sounds. Ley showed that they were often unable\r\nto identify letters they heard pronounced. There is a marked inability\r\nto grasp the meaning of ordinary words. The sense of taste and smell\r\nis comparatively much less impaired. Very defective children object at\r\nonce to quinine when it is placed on the tongue. Nevertheless, many do\r\nnot notice unpleasant odors or even the taste of excreta, etc.,—things\r\nwhich are exceedingly offensive to normal individuals,—and are\r\nentirely indifferent as to the quality of their food. Sensory\r\ndisturbances of the skin are not very marked. In a series of\r\nesthesiometric tests, however, Ley obtained unsatisfactory \"automatic\"\r\nresponses in eighteen cases, meaningless answers in forty-eight, and\r\nintelligent responses in eleven of 127 mental defectives examined. The\r\napplication of the sense of touch in recognizing articles is acquired\r\nwith difficulty. Pain sensations are somewhat diminished also and some\r\ndefectives are apparently insensible to blows, etc. That the sense of\r\nposition and location is not well developed is often shown by coarse,\r\nawkward movements. The sense of weight and motion is lacking. Demoor\r\nfound that the feebleminded usually pointed out the larger article\r\nas being the heavier even when lighter in weight. Claparede found\r\nthis characteristic present in one per cent of ninety-seven pupils\r\nrejected as a result of mental tests, in eight per cent of the mildly\r\nweakminded, and in sixty-five per cent of the markedly defective\r\ncases. Memory is always involved. Superficial impressions are easily\r\nlost. Johnson subjected seventy-two defective children to retention\r\ntests. Seventy could correctly repeat only three numbers; sixty-six\r\nonly four; fifty-one only five; twenty-seven only six; fourteen only\r\nseven, and four only eight. Ranchburg's tests showed them to be very\r\nsusceptible to suggestion. Some defectives, on the other hand, have a\r\npeculiar faculty for remembering dates, numbers, performing feats of\r\narithmetic, etc. The memory defect is usually shown more especially\r\nby the inability to take advantage of the experience of the past. The\r\npatients learn with difficulty, read little and forget what they are\r\ntaught. The events of life leave few traces and make only a superficial\r\nimpression on them. The intellectual horizon for this reason is very\r\nlimited. Their thoughts are confined largely to the matter of clothing,\r\nfood, etc.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental obstacle in the mental progress of the defectives is\r\nthe inadequate elaboration of general impressions and conceptions.\r\nThere is an absence of any understanding of the importance of time,\r\nevents, numbers, etc. They often have no idea whatever as to the\r\nsignificance of money. Dates mean nothing usually and they are often\r\nunable to determine the time of day. The train of thought as shown\r\nby tests made by Buccola is delayed. Their poverty of thought is\r\nshown by the fact that defective children can think of only about\r\none-fourth as many words during a given time as suggest themselves\r\nto the normal child—a test suggested by Binet. Tests reported by\r\nSommer, Nathan, Binet and others show a marked delay in association\r\ntime and an impoverished mental capacity. They frequently repeat the\r\ntest word or give entirely meaningless replies. Associations do not\r\nbecome fixed on repeated tests as they do with normal individuals\r\n(Wreschner). It is not easy for them to repeat numbers, the months of\r\nthe year or days of the week backwards. They cannot supply omitted\r\nwords or syllables in sentences (Ebbinghaus test). It is hard for them\r\nto assemble picture puzzles or pieces of cards. Revesz found that it\r\nwas more difficult for them to learn to divide than to subtract or\r\nadd. Multiplication he found to be most easily acquired. They did not\r\ndo well in tests requiring any reason or judgment. They are entirely\r\nincapable of defining or explaining abstract conceptions of any kind.\r\nThey cannot explain the meaning of fables and have no appreciation of\r\nirony. Nor can they correct the most obvious faults in test sentences.\r\nThey have no insight into their own condition and no grasp on either\r\npast or present events. Their capacity for efficient occupation and\r\nemployment is much diminished. Their ability to acquire an education\r\nis also limited. Of 286 cases examined in school Schlesinger found\r\nonly fifteen per cent to be industrious in their habits. Nine per cent\r\nfailed in writing, eighteen in reading and twenty-four per cent in\r\narithmetic tests.\r\n\r\nThe emotional life is also much impoverished and unstable. There is\r\nno sense of shame and no feeling of family pride or patriotism. There\r\nis often a tendency to commit criminal acts. As a rule the mood is\r\nindifferent and apathetic—in strange surroundings they are sometimes\r\ntimid and anxious. Some feel ashamed of their speech defects and\r\nawkwardness. Others show a childish cheerfulness, or satisfaction\r\nand self-confidence. There is a tendency to uncontrollable laughter,\r\nattacks of anxiety, angry excitement, or childish despair with\r\nhysterical manifestations which disappear quickly. Usually the patients\r\nare inoffensive, manageable and well behaved, but easily susceptible to\r\nbad influences. Often they are queer, whimsical, capricious, obstinate\r\nand childish. Henneberg, who examined a large series of cases,\r\ndescribed 33.8 per cent as anxious, timid, sensitive and inclined to\r\nweep; 15.7 per cent as apathetic, dreamy, sluggish and seclusive; 12.6\r\nper cent as quiet, serious, good-natured, sociable and pleasant; 18.7\r\nas active, cheerful, shallow, playful and talkative; and nineteen per\r\ncent as rude, malicious, obstinate, irritable and bad-tempered. The\r\nsexual life is sometimes undeveloped or may show actual perversions.\r\nBonhöffer found six idiots and fifty-three feebleminded persons in\r\nan examination of 190 prostitutes. The volitional expressions of the\r\ndefective are very largely impulsive. They act without reflection or\r\nregard to consequences and are easily induced to do improper acts.\r\nThe inhibition of will is shown by the defective control of ordinary\r\nmovements in responding to commands. They are always slow in learning\r\nto walk. The childish inability to perform finer and more precise\r\nmovements does not disappear later as it does in the course of normal\r\ndevelopment. This is shown in their gait, awkward movements, etc.\r\nKraepelin interprets the tendency to bedwetting as an evidence of\r\nvolitional disturbance, also the stereotyped, rhythmical movements of\r\nthe idiot. Laser found that forty per cent of his cases had the habit\r\nof biting the finger nails.\r\n\r\nDependent upon the inhibition of volitional impulses, two clinical\r\ngroups of the feebleminded have been described by Kraepelin,—the\r\nexcitable and the apathetic or dull. The excited forms are much\r\nmore common. Schlesinger, however, found thirty-one per cent of his\r\ncases of the apathetic variety; twenty-nine per cent were excitable;\r\ntwenty-eight per cent had simple mental defects, and the remainder\r\nshowed antisocial tendencies. In the apathetic or dull form there is\r\na marked disturbance of the attention; the patient takes no interest\r\nin his surroundings, appears sluggish, awkward, emotionally dull, and\r\ndevoid of any voluntary impulse, often doing only what he is urged\r\nto do. They are usually good-natured, contented, and do simple work\r\nunder direction, in a slow and mechanical way. The lighter grades\r\nare of a dull, weak-willed, readily influenced type. They are timid,\r\nunconcerned and agreeable. The excitable variety, on the other hand,\r\nshow a purposeless, mercurial variability. Their attention is easily\r\ndistracted from one thing to another. They cannot sit still, are\r\nrestless and constantly on the go. Occasionally they are violent.\r\n\r\nThe defective control of motor impulses by the will is also shown in\r\ndefectives by the disturbance of speech and writing. Crailsheimer found\r\nspeech disturbances in 36.3 per cent of his cases, Schlesinger in\r\nthirty per cent, and Leubuscher in fifty per cent. They can often hear\r\nalthough mute, sometimes recovering their speech during an attack of\r\nexcitement. Ley reported stammering in twelve per cent of his cases and\r\nstuttering in thirteen per cent. Agrammatism and akataphasia sometimes\r\noccur. Word-blindness is also referred to as a symptom and various\r\ndisturbances of reading and writing have been observed.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kraepelin, the important developmental landmarks in\r\nthe life of the young are the acquisition of speech (one year), the\r\nbeginning of the school life (six years), the appearance (fourteen\r\nyears) and the completion (eighteen years) of sexual development. The\r\nfirst and second periods represent the relative levels of low and high\r\ngrade idiocy, the third imbecility and the fourth feeblemindedness.\r\nThis classification is somewhat similar to that of Weygandt. The\r\neducation ordinarily acquired by the higher grade of the feebleminded\r\nis somewhat limited. They may even excel in certain occasional lines\r\nof work, for example, in music, art, etc. They are usually poor in\r\nmathematics and lack interest and application as a rule. Difficult\r\napprehension and mental fatigability are to be expected. They have\r\nto go over things repeatedly, as their memory is not good. Their\r\neducation is often ample in some directions and very lacking in others.\r\nTheir judgment is onesided, their viewpoint narrow and their worldly\r\nknowledge childish. What they acquire at school is soon forgotten.\r\nThey take no interest in religion, politics or current events of\r\nimportance, and very impractical ideas are expressed on all questions.\r\nThe emotional manifestations vary. Some are agreeable, cheerful,\r\ntractable; others timid, tenderhearted, sensitive, slightly emotional\r\nor anxious. They are more likely to be obstinate, stubborn, unruly,\r\nrude, irritable, unsociable and violent-tempered. Some have periods\r\nof active excitement and become threatening, abusive and violent.\r\nOccasionally suicidal attempts are made, although they are usually not\r\ngenuine. Some are addicted to sexual excesses, lying or swindling.\r\nSexual perversions also occur in some cases. They are usually incapable\r\nof any continuous occupation and drift from one thing to another. As\r\na rule they have little conception of the value of money and spend\r\nit recklessly. They are very susceptible to alcoholism and often\r\ncommit petty crimes. Occasionally hysterical manifestations—syncopes,\r\nseizures, etc.—appear. Clouded and confused states have been\r\nobserved. Frequently impulsive tendencies are noted. In some instances\r\npsychopathic traits are very striking. Excitable, unstable, impulsive,\r\nquarrelsome and antisocial types appear as well as liars and swindlers.\r\nPeriodical excitements and depressions suggest manic-depressive forms.\r\n\r\nConsiderable confusion has been occasioned by the relation thought\r\nby some to exist between mental deficiency and dementia praecox.\r\nKraepelin[349] has spoken of an engrafted hebephrenia, as shown by the\r\nfollowing quotation from his eighth edition:—\"I made the suggestion\r\na long time ago that certain, not very frequent, forms of idiocy with\r\nwell developed mannerisms and stereotypies were an early expression\r\nof dementia praecox.\" He is of the opinion that \"the affected manners\r\nof certain idiots, as well as the associated stereotypies of attitude\r\nand movement in addition to the negativistic impulses and the\r\npermanent obstinate inaccessibility to all attempts at approach, show\r\nno relation whatever to ordinary childish peculiarities and belong\r\non the contrary to the well-known picture of dementia praecox.\" He\r\ninterprets the \"demenza precocissima\" of Sante de Sanctis and the\r\n\"dementia infantilis\" of Heller as belonging to dementia praecox rather\r\nthan the mental deficiency group. He further makes the suggestion\r\nthat \"weakmindedness existing from youth without focal symptoms, and\r\nlater leading to deterioration, is as a rule to be looked upon as\r\npfropfhebephrenia, if epilepsy and cerebral syphilis can be excluded,\r\nthe former by the absence of seizures, the latter by the results of\r\nthe Wassermann reaction.\" Engrafted hebephrenia or \"pfropfhebephrenia\"\r\nhas been studied by various observers. After an analysis of ten cases\r\nWasner reached the conclusion that feeblemindedness predisposes to\r\ndementia praecox. Weygandt and various other writers are not in accord\r\nwith Kraepelin on this subject. It is, however, generally conceded that\r\nthe occurrence of manic-depressive and other affective psychoses in\r\nmental defectives is not at all infrequent.\r\n\r\nAs special types Kraepelin described microcephalic varieties, the\r\ntuberous sclerosis of Hartdegen and Bourneville (1880), vascular and\r\nother cerebral defects, infantilismus, dysadenoid and other endocrine\r\nconditions, Mongolian idiocy, hydrocephalus, encephalitic forms,\r\netc. Alzheimer, Hammarberg, and Bourneville have made pathological\r\nclassifications of the mental deficiencies.\r\n\r\nPsychoses which render the commitment of mental defectives to hospitals\r\nfor mental diseases necessary are comparatively infrequent, as is\r\nshown by statistics. In the words of the statistical manual, \"the most\r\ncommon mental disturbances are episodes of excitement or irritability,\r\ndepressions, paranoid trends, hallucinatory attacks, etc.\" Cases\r\ndiagnosed as showing manic-depressive psychoses or dementia praecox\r\nare not shown in the mental defective group. Three and forty-eight\r\nhundredths per cent of the admissions to the Massachusetts hospitals\r\nduring 1919 were diagnosed as psychoses with mental deficiency. During\r\na period of eight years the admission rate to the New York hospitals\r\namounted to 2.8 per cent. The admissions to twenty-one institutions in\r\nother states constituted 4.33 per cent of the whole number reported.\r\nIn 70,987 admissions to forty-eight hospitals in sixteen states the\r\npsychoses with mental deficiency amounted to 3.22 per cent of all first\r\nadmissions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbot, E.
