Few tasks in literature are in\r\npractice more worrying than the responsibility of “piecing together”\r\nother people’s fragments, and “the great unknown” who in reviewing my\r\n“Leaves of Prose” thought I had found an easy way of turning myself into\r\nrespectable cement for a tessellated pavement made of other people’s\r\nchipped marble, was evidently a stranger to my particular temperament.\r\nWhere I have been free to express myself without regard to others, to use\r\nonly my own language, and utter only my own views, I have had something\r\nof the feeling of a child out for a holiday, and of course the greater\r\npart of the book is in my own words. But I have often, for obvious\r\nreasons, chosen the humbler task, because, wherever it is possible, it\r\nis good that my readers should have their impressions at first hand, and\r\nin regard to Kinglake especially, from whose non-copyright volumes I\r\nhave given many a page, his masculine tribute to Miss Nightingale is of\r\ninfinitely more value than any words which could come from me.\r\n\r\nMy publisher has kindly allowed me to leave many questions of copyright\r\nto him, but I wish, not the less—rather the more—to thank all those\r\nauthors and publishers who have permitted use of their material and whose\r\nnames will, in many instances, be found incorporated in the text or in\r\nthe accompanying footnotes. I have not thought it necessary in every\r\ninstance to give a reference to volume and page, though occasionally, for\r\nsome special reason of my own, I have done so.\r\n\r\nOf those in closest touch with Miss Nightingale during her lifetime,\r\nwhose help with original material has been invaluable, not more than\r\none can be thanked by name. But to Mrs. Tooley for her large-hearted\r\ngenerosity with regard to her own admirable biography—to which I owe far\r\nmore than the mere quotations so kindly permitted, and in most cases so\r\nclearly acknowledged in the text—it is a great pleasure to express my\r\nthanksgiving publicly.\r\n\r\nThere are many others who have helped me, and not once with regard to\r\nthe little sketch have I met with any unkindness or rebuff. Indeed, so\r\nvarious are the acknowledgments due, and so sincere the gratitude I feel,\r\nthat I scarcely know where to begin.\r\n\r\nTo Miss Rickards, for the pages from her beautiful life of Felicia\r\nSkene, I wish to record heartfelt thanks; and also to Messrs. Burns\r\nand Oates with regard to lengthy quotations from the letters of Sister\r\nAloysius—a deeply interesting little volume published by them in 1904,\r\nunder the title of “A Sister of Mercy’s Memories of the Crimea;” to Dr.\r\nHagberg Wright of the London Library for the prolonged loan of a whole\r\nlibrary of books of reference and the help always accessible to his\r\nsubscribers; and to the librarian of the Derby Free Library for aid in\r\nverifying pedigree. Also to Lord Stanmore for his generous permission to\r\nuse long extracts from his father’s “Life of Lord Herbert,” from which\r\nmore than one valuable letter has been taken; and to Mr. John Murray for\r\nsanctioning this and for like privileges in relation to the lives of\r\nSir John MacNeill and Sir Bartle Frere. To Messrs. William Blackwood,\r\nMessrs. Cassell, Messrs. G. P. Putnam and Sons, as well as to the editors\r\nand publishers of the _Times_, _Daily Telegraph_, _Morning Post_, and\r\n_Evening News_, I wish to add my thanks to those of my publisher.\r\n\r\nTo any reader of this book it will be clear how great a debt I owe to\r\nGeneral Evatt, and he knows, I think, how sincerely I recognize it. Mr.\r\nStephen Paget, the writer of the article on Miss Nightingale in the\r\nDictionary of National Biography, has not only permitted me to quote from\r\nthat—a privilege for which I must also thank Messrs. Smith Elder, and Sir\r\nSidney Lee—but has, in addition, put me in the way of other priceless\r\nmaterial wherewith to do honour to the subject of this biography. I\r\nhave long been grateful to him for the inspiration and charm of his own\r\n“Confessio Medici”—there is now this other obligation to add to that.\r\n\r\nNor can I forgo cordial acknowledgments to the writer and also the\r\npublisher of the charming sketch of Miss Nightingale’s Life published\r\nsome years ago by the Pilgrim Press and entitled “The Story of Florence\r\nNightingale.”\r\n\r\nTo my friend Dr. Lewis N. Chase I owe the rare privilege of an\r\nintroduction to Mr. Walker, the sculptor, who has so graciously permitted\r\nfor my frontispiece a reproduction of the statue he has just completed as\r\na part of our national memorial to Miss Nightingale.\r\n\r\nI desire to thank Miss Rosalind Paget for directing me to sources of\r\ninformation and bestowing on me treasures of time and of memory, as well\r\nas Miss Eleanor F. Rathbone and the writer of Sir John MacNeill’s Life\r\nfor help given by their books, and Miss Marion Holmes for permission to\r\nquote from her inspiring monograph; and last, but by no means least, to\r\nexpress my sense of the self-sacrificing magnanimity with which Miss\r\nE. Brierly, the present editor of _Nursing Notes_, at once offered me\r\nand placed in my hands—what I should never have dreamed of asking,\r\neven had I been a friend of old standing, instead of a comparative\r\nstranger—everything she herself had gathered together and preserved as\r\nbearing on the life of Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\nWhen, under the influence of certain articles in the _Times_, I\r\nundertook to write this volume for Messrs. Nelson, I knew nothing of the\r\nother biographies in the field. Nor had I any idea that an officially\r\nauthorized life was about to be written by Sir Edward Cook, a biographer\r\nwith an intellectual equipment far beyond my own, but who will not\r\nperhaps grudge me the name of friend, since his courteous considerateness\r\nfor all leads many others to make a like claim, and the knowledge that\r\nhe would put no obstacle in my path has spared me what might have been\r\na serious difficulty. Had I known all this, a decent modesty might have\r\nprevented my undertaking. But in every direction unforeseen help has been\r\nshowered upon me, and nothing but my own inexorable limitations have\r\nstood in my way.\r\n\r\nIf there be any who, by their books, or in any other way, have helped me,\r\nbut whom by some unhappy oversight I have omitted to name in these brief\r\ndocumentary thanks, I must earnestly beg them to believe that such an\r\nerror is contrary to my intention and goodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n         Introductory Chapter                                         15\r\n\r\n      I.

Girls and boys of fourteen to sixteen are already on the\r\nthreshold of manhood and womanhood, but even of children I am sure it\r\nis true that they hate to be “written down to,” since they are eagerly\r\ndrinking in hopes and ideas which they cannot always put into words, and\r\nto such hopes and ideas they give eager sympathy of heart and curiosity\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale’s Home, Embley Park, Romsey, Hants.]\r\n\r\nFor one of her St. Thomas’s nurses, among the first nine women to be\r\ndecorated with the Red Cross, the heroine of this story wrote what might\r\nwell be the marching orders of many a good soldier in the divine army,\r\nand not least, perhaps, of those boy scouts and girl guides who would\r\nlike better a life of adventure than the discipline of a big school or\r\nthe “duties enough and little cares” of a luxurious home; and as the\r\nwords have not, so far as I am aware, appeared in print before, it may be\r\nworth while to give them here:—\r\n\r\n    “Soldiers,” she wrote, “must obey orders. And to you the\r\n    ‘roughing’ it has been the resigning yourself to ‘comforts’\r\n    which you detested and to work which you did not want, while\r\n    the work which wanted you was within reach. A severe kind\r\n    of ‘roughing’ indeed—perhaps the severest, as I know by sad\r\n    experience.\r\n\r\n    “But it will not last. This short war is not life. But all will\r\n    depend—your possible future in the work, we pray for you, O my\r\n    Cape of Good Hope—upon the name you gain here. That name I know\r\n    will be of one who obeys authority, however unreasonable, in\r\n    the name of Him who is above all, and who is Reason itself—of\r\n    one who submits to disagreeables, however unjust, for the\r\n    work’s sake and for His who tells us to love those we don’t\r\n    like—a precept I follow oh so badly—of one who never criticizes\r\n    so that it can even be guessed at that she has criticism in her\r\n    heart—and who helps her companions to submit by her own noble\r\n    example....\r\n\r\n    “I have sometimes found in my life that the very hindrances\r\n    I had been deploring were there expressly to fit me for\r\n    the next step in my life. (This was the case—hindrances of\r\n    _years_—before the Crimean War.)” And elsewhere she writes: “To\r\n    have secured for you all the _circumstances_ we wished for your\r\n    work, I would gladly have given my life. But you are made to\r\n    rise above circumstances; perhaps this is God’s way—His ways\r\n    are not as our ways—of preparing you for the great work which I\r\n    am persuaded He has in store for you some day.”\r\n\r\nIt is touching to find her adding in parenthesis that before her own work\r\nwas given to her by the Great Unseen Commander, she had ten years of\r\ncontradictions and disappointments, and adding, as if with a sigh from\r\nthe heart, “And oh, how badly I did it!”\r\n\r\nThere we have the humility of true greatness. All her work was amazing\r\nin its fruitfulness, but those who knew her best feel sometimes that the\r\npart of her work which was greatest of all and will endure longest is\r\njust the part of which most people know least. I mean her great labour\r\nof love for India, which I cannot doubt has already saved the lives of\r\nmillions, and will in the future save the health and working power of\r\nmillions more.\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale would have enriched our calendar of uncanonized\r\nsaints even if her disciplined high-hearted goodness had exercised an\r\nunseen spell by simply _being_, and had, by some limitation of body or\r\nof circumstance, been cut off from much active _doing_: for so loving\r\nand obedient a human will, looking ever to the Highest, as a handmaiden\r\nwatches the eyes of her mistress, is always and everywhere a humane\r\ninfluence and a divine offering. But in her life—a light set on a\r\nhill—being and doing went hand in hand in twofold beauty and strength,\r\nfor even through those years when she lay on her bed, a secluded\r\nprisoner, her activities were world-wide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work for which she is most widely revered and loved,\r\nMiss Nightingale did three things—each leaving a golden imprint upon the\r\nhistory of our time:—\r\n\r\nShe broke down a “Chinese wall” of prejudice with regard to the\r\noccupations of women, and opened up a new and delightful sphere of hard,\r\nbut congenial, work for girls.\r\n\r\nShe helped to reconstruct, on the lines of feminine common sense,\r\nthe hygiene and the transport service of our army—yes, of the entire\r\nimperial army, for what is a success in one branch of our dominions\r\ncannot permanently remain unaccepted by the rest. And in all her work for\r\nour army she had, up to the time of his death, unbounded help from her\r\nfriend, Lord Herbert.\r\n\r\nLast, and perhaps greatest of all, she initiated, with the help of Sir\r\nBartle Frere, Sir John Lawrence, and other enlightened men of her time,\r\nthe reform of insanitary and death-dealing neglect throughout the length\r\nand breadth of India, thus saving countless lives, not only from death,\r\nbut from what is far worse—a maimed or invalid existence of lowered\r\nvitality and lessened mental powers.\r\n\r\nOne of her friends, himself a great army doctor holding a high official\r\nposition, has repeatedly spoken of her to me as the supreme embodiment\r\nof citizenship. She did indeed exemplify what Ruskin so nobly expressed\r\nin his essay on “Queens’ Gardens”—the fact that, while men and women\r\ndiffer profoundly and essentially, and life would lose in beauty if they\r\ndid not, the state has need of them both; for what the woman should be\r\nat her own hearth, the guardian of order, of health, of beauty, and of\r\nlove, that also should she be at that wider imperial hearth where there\r\nare children to be educated, soldiers to be equipped, wounded lives to be\r\ntended, and the health of this and future generations to be diligently\r\nguarded.\r\n\r\n“Think,” she said once to one of her nurses, “less of what you may\r\ngain than of what you may give.” Herself, she gave royally—gave her\r\nfortune, her life, her soul’s treasure. I read in a recent contemporary\r\nof high standing a review which ended with what seemed to me a very\r\nheathen sentence, which stamped itself on my memory by its arrogant\r\nnarrowness. “Woman,” wrote the reviewer, “is always either frustrate\r\nor absorbed;” and there leaped to my heart the exclamation, “Here in\r\nFlorence Nightingale is the answer; for in her we have one, known and\r\nread of all men, who was neither the one nor the other.” That there was\r\nsupreme renunciation in her life, none who is born to womanhood can\r\ndoubt; for where could there be any who would have been more superbly\r\nfitted for what she herself regarded as the natural lot of woman as wife\r\nand mother? But she, brilliant, beautiful, and worshipped, was called\r\nto a more difficult and lonely path, and if there was hidden suffering,\r\nit did but make her service of mankind the more untiring, her practical\r\nand keen-edged intellect the more active in good work, her tenderness to\r\npain and humility of self-effacement the more beautiful and just.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and said truly, that she did not suffer fools gladly,\r\nand she knew well how very human she was in this and in other ways, as\r\nfar removed from a cold and statuesque faultlessness as are all ardent,\r\nswift, loving natures here on earth. But her words were words of wisdom\r\nwhen she wrote to one dear to her whom she playfully named “her Cape of\r\nGood Hope”: “Let us be persecuted for righteousness’ sake, _but not for\r\nunrighteousness_.”\r\n\r\nThe italics are mine, because in their warning they seem so singularly\r\ntimely. And the entire sentence is completely in tune with that fine note\r\nwith which she ends one of her delightful volumes on nursing—\r\n\r\n“I would earnestly ask my sisters to keep clear of both the jargons\r\nnow current everywhere (for they are equally jargons): of the jargon,\r\nnamely, about the ‘rights’ of women which urges women to do all that men\r\ndo, including the medical and other professions, merely because men do\r\nit, and without regard to whether this _is_ the best that women can do;\r\nand of the jargon which urges women to do nothing that men do, merely\r\nbecause they are women, and should be ‘recalled to a sense of their duty\r\nas women,’ and because ‘this is women’s work,’ and ‘that is men’s,’ and\r\n‘these are things which women should not do,’ which is all assertion and\r\nnothing more. Surely woman should bring the best she has, _whatever_ that\r\nis, to the work of God’s world, without attending to either of these\r\ncries. For what are they, both of them, the one _just_ as much as the\r\nother, but listening to the ‘what people will say,’ to opinion, to the\r\n‘voices from without’? And as a wise man has said, no one has ever done\r\nanything great or useful by listening to the voices from without.\r\n\r\n“You do not want the effect of your good things to be, ‘How wonderful\r\nfor a _woman_!’ nor would you be deterred from good things by hearing\r\nit said, ‘Yes, but she ought not to have done this, because it is not\r\nsuitable for a woman.’ But you want to do the thing that is good,\r\nwhether it is ‘suitable for a woman,’ or not.\r\n\r\n“It does not make a thing good, that it is remarkable that a woman should\r\nhave been able to do it. Neither does it make a thing bad, which would\r\nhave been good had a man done it, that it has been done by a woman.\r\n\r\n“Oh, leave these jargons, and go your way straight to God’s work, in\r\nsimplicity and singleness of heart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    _Florence Nightingale: her home, her birthplace, and her\r\n    family._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the heart of Derbyshire there is a quaint old church, once a private\r\nchapel, and possessing, instead of a churchyard, a bit of quiet\r\ngreenness, of which the chief ornament, besides the old yew tree at the\r\nchurch door, is a kind of lovers’ bower made by two ancient elder trees\r\nwhich have so intertwined their branches as to form an arbour, where in\r\nsummer-time sweethearts can gossip and the children play. It belonged to\r\na world far away from the world of to-day, when, in the high-backed pews\r\nreserved for the “quality,” little Florence Nightingale, in her Sunday\r\nattire that was completed by Leghorn hat and sandal shoes, made, Sunday\r\nafter Sunday, a pretty vision for the villagers, in whose cottages she\r\nwas early a welcome visitor. It was just such a church as we read of in\r\nGeorge Eliot’s stories, clerk and parson dividing the service between\r\nthem, and the rustic bareness of the stone walls matched by the visible\r\nbell-ropes and the benches for the labouring people. But the special\r\nstory that has come down from those days suggests that the parson was\r\nmore satirical than Mr. Gilfil or Mr. Tryan, and it is to be feared that\r\nwhen he remarked that “a lie is a very useful thing in trade,” the people\r\nwho quoted him in Derby market-place merely used his “Devil’s text” as\r\na convenience and saw no satire in it at all. Have we really travelled\r\na little way towards honesty since those days, or have we grown more\r\nhypocritical?\r\n\r\nThe little girl in the squire’s pew grew up in a home where religious\r\nshams were not likely to be taken at their face value.\r\n\r\nHer father, who was one of the chief supporters of the cheap schools\r\nof the neighbourhood, had his own ways of helping the poor folk on his\r\nestate, but used to reply to some of the beseeching people who wanted\r\nmoney from him for local charities that he was “not born generous.”\r\nGenerous or not, he had very decided views about the education of his\r\ntwo children, Florence and Parthe. They enjoyed nearly a hundred years\r\nago (Florence was born in 1820) as liberal a course of study as any High\r\nSchool girl of to-day, and no doubt it is true that the orderliness of\r\nmind and character, at which his methods aimed, proved of countless value\r\nto Florence in those later days, when her marvellous power in providing\r\nfor minutest details without unnecessary fuss or friction banished the\r\nfilth and chaos of the first Crimean hospitals, and transformed them\r\ninto abodes of healing and of order. She grew up to be a beautiful and\r\ncharming woman, for whom men would gladly have laid down their lives; yet\r\nher beauty and her charm alone could not have secured for our wounded\r\nsoldiers in the Crimea, tortured by dirt and neglect, the swift change to\r\ncleanness and comfort and good nursing which her masterly and unbending\r\nmethods aided her commanding personal influence to win.\r\n\r\nBut this is leaping too far ahead. As yet she is only Parthenope’s\r\nlittle playfellow and schoolfellow in the room devoted to “lessons” at\r\nLea Hall, the small maiden who climbs the hill on Sundays to the church\r\nwhere the yew tree guards the door, and on week-days is busy or at play\r\nin the house that has been the home of her father’s family through many\r\ngenerations, and in the grounds of the manor that surround it.\r\n\r\nLea Hall is in that part of the country which Father Benson has described\r\nin his novel, “Come Rack, come Rope,” and the Nightingale children\r\nwere within easy reach of Dethick Hall, where young Anthony Babington\r\nhad lived. It must have added zest to their history lessons and their\r\ngirlish romancings to hear of the secret passage, which was supposed to\r\nlead right into Wingfield Manor, from the underground cellar close to\r\nthe old wall that showed still where Dethick had once reared its stately\r\nbuildings. The fact that the farm bailiff now kept his potatoes there\r\nand could not find the opening, would only make it a constant new ground\r\nfor adventure and imagination. For they would be told of course—these\r\nchildren—how Mary Stuart had once been a prisoner at Dethick, and Anthony\r\nhad vowed to be her servant in life or death and never cease from the\r\nstruggle to set her free so long as life was in him. Nor did he; for he\r\ndied before her, and it was not at Wingfield, but at Fotheringay, as\r\nthese little students very well knew, no doubt, that her lovely head soon\r\nafterwards was laid upon the block.\r\n\r\nEnviable children to have such a playground of imagination at their\r\ndoors! But, indeed, all children have that, and a bare room in a slum,\r\nor a little patch of desert ground, may for them be danced over by Queen\r\nMab and all her fairies, or guarded by the very angel who led St. Peter\r\nout of prison. Still, it is very exciting to have history written beside\r\nthe doorstep where you live, and if you grow up in a home where lesson\r\nbooks are an important part of the day’s duties, it is pleasant to find\r\nthem making adventures for you on your father’s own estate. It mattered\r\nnothing that the story would all be told by those contending against\r\nAnthony’s particular form of religion, who would be ready to paint him\r\nwith as black an ink as their regard for justice would allow. To a child,\r\nthat would rather enhance the vividness of it all. And there was the\r\nactual kitchen still standing, with its little harmless-looking trapdoor\r\nin the roof that leads into the secret chamber, where the persecuted\r\npriests used to hide when they came to celebrate a secret Mass. No\r\nwonder the two children delighted in Dethick, and wove many a tale\r\nabout it. For had they not seen with their very own eyes the great open\r\nfireplace in that kitchen, where venison used to be roasted, and the very\r\nroasting-jack hanging from its central beam where all the roof-beams were\r\nblack with age and dark with many tragic memories?\r\n\r\nDethick is but one of the three villages included in the ancient manor,\r\nthe other two are Lea and Holloway; and in the days of King John, long\r\nbefore it came to the Nightingales, the De Alveleys had built a chapel\r\nthere. Those who have read Mr. Skipton’s life of Nicholas Ferrar and know\r\ntheir John Inglesant, will be interested to hear that half this manor had\r\npassed through the hands of the Ferrars among others, and another portion\r\nhad belonged to families whose names suggest a French origin. But the\r\ntwo inheritances had now met in the hands of the Nightingales.\r\n\r\nIt is a very enchanting part of the Midlands. The silvery Derwent\r\nwinds through the valleys, keeping fresh the fields of buttercups and\r\nmeadowsweet and clover, and in the tall hedges wild roses mingle their\r\nsweetness with the more powerful fragrance of the honeysuckle, until both\r\nyield to the strange and overwhelming perfume of the elder tree. The\r\nlimestone hills, with their bold and mountainlike outline, their tiny\r\nrills, and exquisite ferns, had been less spoiled in those days by the\r\ntramp of tourists; and the purity of the air, the peacefulness of the\r\nupland solitudes, would have a wholesome share in the “grace that can\r\nmould the maiden’s form by silent sympathy.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale’s Father.]\r\n\r\nIt was a very youthful little maiden as yet who had been transplanted\r\ninto these English wilds from the glory and the sunshine of the Italy\r\nwhere she was born. After the valley of the Arno and the splendours of\r\nFlorence, it may have seemed somewhat cold and bracing at times. Rightly\r\nor wrongly, the father of the little girls—for our heroine’s sister,\r\nnamed after another Italian city, shared all her life at this time—seems\r\nto a mere outsider a little cold and bracing too. He came of a very old\r\nfamily, and we hear of his “pride of birth.” His wife, on the other\r\nhand, whom Florence Nightingale resembled, lives before us in more warm\r\nand glowing colours, as one who did much to break down the barriers of\r\ncaste and, with a heart of overflowing love, “went about doing good.”\r\nBoth were people of real cultivation—good breeding being theirs by a\r\nhappy inheritance—and each seems to have had a strong and distinctive\r\npersonality. It might not be easy to say to which of the two the little\r\ndaughter, who grew to such world-wide fame, owed most; but probably\r\nthe equipment for her life-work was fairly divided between the two.\r\nThere is no magnet so powerful as force of character, and it is clear\r\nthat her father possessed moral and intellectual force of a notable\r\nsort. Love, in the sense of enthusiasm for humanity, will always be the\r\nheaven-born gift of one in whom religion is such a reality as it was with\r\nFlorence Nightingale, but religious ardour may be sadly ineffective\r\nif defeated by the slack habits of a lifetime, or even by a moral and\r\nmental vagueness that befogs holy intentions. Mr. Edward Nightingale’s\r\ndaughters were disciplined in a schoolroom where slackness and disorder\r\nwere not permitted, and a somewhat severe training in the classics was\r\nsupplemented by the example of Mrs. Nightingale’s excellent housewifery,\r\nand by that fine self-control in manners and behaviour which in the\r\nold-fashioned days used to be named “deportment.” Sports and outdoor\r\nexercises were a part—and a delightful part—of the day’s routine.\r\n\r\nBut let us go back a few years and give a few pages to the place of\r\nFlorence Nightingale’s birth and the history of her family. Her name,\r\nlike that of another social reformer among Englishwomen, was linked\r\nwith Italy, and she took it from the famous old Italian town in\r\nwhose neighbourhood she was born. I have tried in vain to trace the\r\nauthorship[1]—was it Ruskin or some less known writer?—who said of\r\nthat town, “if you wish to see it to perfection, fix upon such a day as\r\nFlorence owes the sun, and, climbing the hill of Bellosguardo, or past\r\nthe stages of the Via Crucis to the church of San Miniato, look forth\r\nupon the scene before you. You trace the course of the Arno from the\r\ndistant mountains on the right, through the heart of the city, winding\r\nalong the fruitful valley toward Pisa. The city is beneath you, like a\r\npearl set in emerald. All colours are in the landscape, and all sounds\r\nare in the air. The hills look almost heathery. The sombre olive and\r\nfunereal cypress blend with the graceful acacia and the clasping vine.\r\nThe hum of the insect and the carol of bird chime with the blithe voices\r\nof men; while dome, tower, mountains, the yellow river, the quaint\r\nbridges, spires, palaces, gardens, and the cloudless heavens overhanging,\r\nmake up a panorama on which to gaze in trance of rapture until the spirit\r\nwearies from the exceeding beauty of the vision.”\r\n\r\nWhen on May 12, 1820, Florence Nightingale was born, her parents were\r\nstaying at the Villa Colombaia, near to this beautiful City of Flowers;\r\nand when the question of a name for her arose, they were of one mind\r\nabout it—she must be called after the city itself. They had no sons, and\r\nthis child’s elder sister, their only other daughter, having been born at\r\nNaples, had taken its ancient and classical name of Parthenope.[2]\r\n\r\nTheir own family name had changed. Mr. Nightingale, who was first known\r\nas William Edward Shore, was the only son of Mr. William Shore of Tapton,\r\nin Derbyshire, and the child who was to reform England’s benighted views\r\nof nursing, and do so much for the health, not only of our British\r\ntroops, but also of our Indian Army, was related through that family\r\nto John Shore, a famous physician in Derby in the reign of Charles the\r\nSecond, as well as to the Governor-General of India who, twenty-three\r\nyears before her birth, took the title of Baron Teignmouth. It was\r\nthrough her father’s mother, the only daughter of Mr. Evans of Cromford,\r\nthat she was linked with the family of the Nightingales, whose name her\r\nfather afterwards took. Mary Evans, her paternal grandmother, was the\r\nniece of “Old Peter,” a rich and roystering squire, who was well liked\r\nin his own neighbourhood, in spite of his nickname of “Madman Peter”\r\nand the rages that now and then overtook him. Florence Nightingale\r\nwas, however, no descendant of his, for he never married, and all his\r\npossessions, except those which he sold to Sir Richard Arkwright, the\r\nfamous cotton-spinner, came to his niece, who was the mother of Miss\r\nNightingale’s father. When all this landed property came into the\r\nhands of Mr. Edward Shore, three years before his marriage and five\r\nyears before Florence was born, his name was changed under the Prince\r\nRegent’s sign manual from Shore to Nightingale, in accordance with Peter\r\nNightingale’s will. But he continued to live in Italy for a great part of\r\nevery year until Florence was nearly five years old, though the change of\r\nownership on the English estate was at once felt under the new squire,\r\nwho was in most ways the very opposite of that “Old Peter,” of whom we\r\nread that when he had been drinking, as was then the fashion, he would\r\nfrighten away the servant-maids by rushing into the kitchen and throwing\r\nthe puddings on the dust-heap.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Nightingale, our heroine’s father, bore a character without\r\nfear or reproach. Educated at Edinburgh and at Trinity, Cambridge, he had\r\nafterwards travelled a good deal, at a time when travel was by no means\r\nthe commonplace that it is now.\r\n\r\nHe is described as “tall and slim,” and from the descriptions we have of\r\nhim it is clear that no one, even at a glance, could have missed the note\r\nof distinction in his bearing, or mistaken him for other than that which\r\nhe was proud to be, the cultivated and enlightened son of a fine old\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nWhen we read that the lady he married was daughter of a strong\r\nAbolitionist, Mr. William Smith of Parndon, in Essex, we feel that the\r\nvery name of Abolitionist belongs to a bygone past.\r\n\r\nIn those days the American Civil War was still to come, but the horizon\r\nwas already beginning to blacken for it, just as in Europe, while two\r\nhappy little girls were playing hide-and-seek in the gardens of Lea Hall\r\nand racing with their dogs across the meadows to Dethick, the hush\r\nbefore the tempest did not blind wise statesmen to those dangers in the\r\nNear East which were to overwhelm us in so terrible a war.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith, in desiring ardently the abolition of slavery, was ahead of\r\nmany Englishmen of his day. He was an eager philanthropist, who for half\r\na century represented Norwich in Parliament, and had therefore real power\r\nin urging any good cause he had at heart. His daughter Frances, when she\r\nbecame Mrs. Nightingale, did not cease to labour among the poor in the\r\nspirit of her father and of her own benevolent heart. She was a beautiful\r\nand impressive woman, and in her untiring service of others seems to have\r\nbeen just the wife for Mr. Nightingale, who was ready to further every\r\ngood work in his own neighbourhood. He, in his artistic and scholarly\r\ntastes, was as humane and enlightened as was the woman of his choice in\r\nher own skill of hand and charm of household guidance.\r\n\r\nFor Mrs. Nightingale was not only a notable housekeeper and her\r\nhusband’s companion in the world of books, she was also a woman whose\r\nindividuality of thought and action had been deepened by her practical\r\nfaith, so that even at a time when England was still tied and bound by\r\nconventions of rank, from which the last fifty years have released many\r\ndevotees, she felt the call of the Master to a deeper and wider sense of\r\nbrotherhood, and had a great wish to break through artificial barriers.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, she found many innocent ways of doing so. But she\r\ndid not know in these early days that in giving to the world a little\r\ndaughter who was akin to her in this, she had found the best way of all;\r\nfor that daughter was to serve others in the very spirit of those great\r\nones of old—S. Teresa and S. Catharine and the Blessed Joan of Arc—to\r\nwhom the real things were so real and so continually present that the\r\nworld’s voices were as nothing in comparison. This was true also of Mrs.\r\nBrowning, whose memory has already come to mind, as linked, like that\r\nof Florence Nightingale, though for quite other reasons, with the City\r\nof Flowers; and although a life of action in the ordinary sense was\r\nimpossible for the author of “Aurora Leigh,” yet it is remarkable how\r\nmuch she also did to arouse and set free her sisters, for she too, like\r\nthe others, was a woman of great practical discernment.\r\n\r\nThe little peasant maid of France, who was born to be a warrior and the\r\ndeliverer of her people, had this in common with the little English girl\r\nborn to a great inheritance and aiming at a higher and humbler estate\r\nwherein she was the queen of nurses, that both cared so much for the\r\ncommands from above as to be very little influenced by the gossip round\r\nabout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    _Life at Lea Hurst and Embley._\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence was between five and six years old when the Nightingales moved\r\nfrom Lea Hall into their new home at Lea Hurst, a house commanding a\r\nspecially beautiful outlook, and built under Mr. Nightingale’s own\r\nsupervision with much care and taste, about a mile from the old home. It\r\nis only fourteen miles out of Derby, though there would seem to be many\r\nsleepy inhabitants of that aristocratic old town—like the old lady of\r\nHendon who lived on into the twentieth century without having been into\r\nthe roaring city of London hard by—who know nothing of the attractions\r\nwithin a few miles of them; for Mrs. Tooley tells an amusing story of a\r\nphotographer there who supposed Lea Hurst to be a distinguished man and a\r\nlocal celebrity.\r\n\r\nTo some it seemed that there was a certain bleakness in the country\r\nsurrounding Lea Hall, but, though the two dwellings are so short a\r\ndistance apart, Lea Hurst is set in a far more perfect landscape. Hills\r\nand woodlands, stretching far away to Dovedale, are commanded by the\r\nbroad terrace of upland on which the house stands, and it looks across to\r\nthe bold escarpment known as Crich Stand, while deep below, the Derwent\r\nmakes music on its rocky course. Among the foxglove and the bracken, the\r\ngritstone rocks jutting forth are a hovering place for butterflies and a\r\nhaunt of the wild bee.\r\n\r\nThe house itself—shaped like a cross, gabled and mullioned, and\r\nheightened by substantial chimney-stacks—is solid, unpretending,\r\nsatisfying to the eye. Above the fine oriel window in the drawing-room\r\nwing is the balcony pointed out to visitors where, they are told, after\r\nthe Crimea “Miss Florence used to come out and speak to the people.”\r\n\r\nThe building of the house was completed in 1825, and above the door that\r\ndate is inscribed, together with the letter N. The drawing-room and\r\nlibrary look south, and open on to the garden, and “from the library\r\na flight of stone steps leads down to the lawn.” In the centre of the\r\ngarden front an old chapel has been built into the mansion, and it may\r\nbe that the prayers of the unknown dead have been answered in the life\r\nof the child who grew up under its shadow, and to whom the busy toiling\r\nworld has owed so much.\r\n\r\nThe terraced garden at the back of the house, with its sweet\r\nold-fashioned flowers and blossoming apple trees, has doubtless grown\r\nmore delightful with every year of its advancing age, but what an\r\ninterest the two little girls must have had when it was first being\r\nplanted out and each could find a home for her favourite flowers!\r\nFuchsias were among those loved by little Florence, who, as has already\r\nbeen noted, was only six years old when she and her sister and father and\r\nmother moved into Lea Hurst, and there was a large bed of these outside\r\nthe chapel. The old schoolroom and nursery at the back of the house\r\nlook out upon the hills, and in a quiet corner of the garden there is a\r\nsummer-house where Florence and her only sister, who had no brothers to\r\nshare their games, must often have played and worked.\r\n\r\nLea Hurst is a quiet, beautiful home, characteristically English and\r\nunpretending, with a modest park-gate, and beyond the park those Lea\r\nWoods where the hyacinths bloom and where it is still told how “Miss\r\nFlorence” loved to walk through the long winding avenue with its grand\r\nviews of the distant hills and woods.\r\n\r\nBut the Nightingales did not spend the whole year at Lea Hurst. In the\r\nautumn it was their custom to move to Embley, in Hampshire, where they\r\nspent the winter and early spring. They usually sent the servants on\r\nahead with the luggage, and drove by easy stages in their own carriage,\r\ntaking the journey at leisure, and putting up at inns by the way.\r\nSometimes, of course, they travelled by coach. Those of us who only know\r\nthe Derby road in the neighbourhood of towns like Nottingham and Derby\r\nnow that its coaching glories are past, find it difficult to picture\r\nits gaiety in those old coaching days, when the very horses enjoyed\r\nthe liveliness of the running, and the many carriages with their gay\r\npostilions and varied occupants were on the alert for neighbour or friend\r\nwho might be posting in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWhether in autumn or in spring, the drive must have been a joy. The\r\nvaried beauty of the Midlands recalls the lines in “Aurora Leigh” which\r\nspeak of\r\n\r\n    “Such nooks of valleys lined with orchises,\r\n    Fed full of noises by invisible streams;\r\n    And open pastures where you scarcely tell\r\n    White daisies from white dew, ...\r\n    ... the clouds, the fields,\r\n    The happy violets hiding from the roads\r\n    The primroses run down to, carrying gold;\r\n    The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out\r\n    Impatient horns and tolerant churning mouths\r\n    ’Twixt dripping ash-boughs,—hedgerows all alive\r\n    With birds and gnats and large white butterflies\r\n    Which look as if the May-flower had caught life\r\n    And palpitated forth upon the wind;\r\n    Hills, vales, woods, netted in a silver mist,\r\n    Farms, granges, doubled up among the hills;\r\n    And cattle grazing in the watered vales,\r\n    And cottage-chimneys smoking from the woods,\r\n    And cottage-gardens smelling everywhere,\r\n    Confused with smell of orchards.”\r\n\r\nDerbyshire itself, with its wild lilies of the valley, its ferns and\r\ndaffodils and laughing streams, is hardly more “taking” than the country\r\nthrough which winds the silver Trent, past Nottingham Castle, perched\r\non its rock and promontory above the fields where the wild crocus in\r\nthose days made sheets of vivid purple, and the steep banks of Clifton\r\nGrove, with its shoals of blue forget-me-not, making a dim, tree-crowned\r\noutline, with here and there a gleam of silver, as seen by the chariots\r\n“on the road.” Wollaton Park, with its great beeches and limes and\r\nglimpses of shy deer, would give gold and crimson and a thousand shades\r\nof russet to the picture.\r\n\r\nAnd farther south, at the other end of the journey, what miles of\r\norchards and pine woods and sweet-scented heather—what rolling Downs and\r\nSurrey homesteads along the turnpike roads!\r\n\r\nThough Parthenope and Florence had no brothers to play with them, they\r\nseem to have had a great variety of active occupations, both at Lea\r\nHurst and at Embley. Of course they had their dolls, like other little\r\ngirls; but those which belonged to Florence had a way of falling into the\r\ndoctor’s hands—an imaginary doctor, of course—and needing a good deal of\r\ntender care and attention. Florence seemed never tired of looking after\r\ntheir various ailments. In fact, she had at times a whole dolls’ hospital\r\nto tend. She probably picked up a little amateur knowledge of medicine\r\nquite early in life; for the poor people in the neighbourhood used to\r\ncome to her mother for help in any little emergency, and Mrs. Nightingale\r\nwas, like many another Lady Bountiful of her generation, equipped with a\r\ncertain amount of traditional wisdom and kindly common sense, aided in\r\nher case by wider reading and a better educated mind than the ordinary.\r\n\r\nFlorence, having somehow escaped measles and whooping-cough, was not\r\nallowed to run into infection in the cottages, but that did not prevent\r\nthe sending of beef-teas and jellies and other helpful and neighbourly\r\ngifts, which could be tied to her pony’s saddle-bow and left by her at\r\nthe door. She learned to know the cottagers with a frank and very human\r\nintimacy, and their homely wit touched her own, their shrewdness and\r\nsympathy met their like in her, and as she grew older, all this added\r\nto her power and her charm. She learned to know both the north and\r\nthe south in “her ain countree,” and when, later in life, she was the\r\nwise angel of hope to the brave “Tommies,” recruited from such homes,\r\nmeeting them as she did amid unrecorded agonies that were far worse\r\nthan the horrors of the battlefield, she understood them all the better\r\nas men, because she had known just such boys as they had been and was\r\nfamiliar with just such homes as those in which they grew up. According\r\nto Mrs. Tooley’s biography, the farmhouse where Adam Bede fell in love\r\nwith Hetty was just the other side of the meadows at Lea Hurst, and the\r\nold mill-wheel, where Maggie Tulliver’s father ground the corn of the\r\nneighbourhood, was only two or three miles away. Marian Evans, of whom\r\nthe world still thinks and speaks by her pen-name of George Eliot, came\r\nsometimes to visit her kinsfolk in the thatched cottage by Wirksworth\r\nTape Mills, and has left us in her earlier novels a vivid picture of the\r\ncottage life that surrounded our heroine during that part of the year\r\nwhich she spent in the Derbyshire home. The children, of course, had\r\ntheir own garden, which they dug and watered, and Florence was so fond\r\nof flowers and animals that that again was an added bond with her rustic\r\nneighbours. Flower-missions had not in those days been heard of, but she\r\noften tied up a nosegay of wild flowers for invalid villagers, or took\r\nsome of her favourites out of her own garden to the sick people whom she\r\nvisited.\r\n\r\nThe story of her first patient has already been told several times in\r\nprint, but no biography would be complete without it.\r\n\r\nShe had nursed many dolls back to convalescence—to say nothing of\r\n“setting” their broken limbs—tempted their delicate appetites with\r\ndainties offered on toy plates, and dressed the burns when her sister let\r\nthem tumble too near the nursery fire; but as yet she had had no real\r\nhuman patient, when one day, out riding with her friend the vicar over\r\nthe Hampshire Downs near Embley, they noticed that Roger, an old shepherd\r\nwhom they knew very well, was having endless trouble in getting his sheep\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“Where’s Cap?” asked the vicar, drawing up his horse, for Cap was a very\r\ncapable and trusted sheep-dog.\r\n\r\n“T’ boys have been throwing stones at ‘n and they’ve broken t’ poor\r\nchap’s leg. Won’t ever be any good no more, a’m thinkin’. Best put him\r\nout of ‘s misery.”\r\n\r\n“O Roger!” exclaimed a clear young voice, “poor Cap’s leg broken? Can’t\r\nwe do anything for him?”\r\n\r\n“Where is he?” added Florence eagerly, for the voice was that of the\r\nfuture “Queen of Nurses.” “Oh, we can’t leave him all alone in his pain.\r\nJust think how cruel!”\r\n\r\n“Us can’t do no good, miss, nor you nayther. I’se just take a cord to him\r\nto-night; ’tis the only way to ease his pain.”\r\n\r\nBut Florence turned to plead with the vicar, and to beg that some further\r\neffort should be made.\r\n\r\nThe vicar, urged by the compassion in the young face looking up to his,\r\nturned his horse’s head in the right direction for a visit to Cap. In a\r\nmoment Florence’s pony was put to the gallop, and she was the first to\r\narrive at the shed where the poor dog was lying.\r\n\r\nCap’s faithful brown eyes were soon lifted to hers, as she tenderly tried\r\nto make him understand her loving sympathy, caressing him with her little\r\nhand and speaking soothingly with her own lips and eyes; till, like the\r\nsuffering men whose wounds would in the far-off years be eased through\r\nher skill, the dog looked up at her in dumb and worshipping gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe vicar was equal to the occasion, and soon discovered that the leg was\r\nnot broken at all, but badly bruised and swollen, and perhaps an even\r\ngreater source of danger and pain than if there had merely been a broken\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nWhen he suggested a “compress,” his child-companion was puzzled for a\r\nmoment. She thought she knew all about poultices and bandages, and I\r\ndaresay she had often given her dolls a mustard plaster; but a “compress”\r\nsounded like something new and mysterious. It was, of course, a great\r\nrelief when she learned that she only needed to keep soaking cloths in\r\nhot water, wringing them out, and folding them over Cap’s injured leg,\r\nrenewing them as quickly as they cooled. She was a nimble little person,\r\nand, with the help of the shepherd boy, soon got a fire of sticks kindled\r\nin a neighbouring cottage and the kettle singing on it with the necessary\r\nboiling water. But now what to do for cloths? Time is of importance in\r\nsick-nursing when every moment of delay means added pain to the sufferer.\r\nTo ride home would have meant the loss of an hour or two, and thrifty\r\ncottagers are not always ready to tear up scant and cherished house-linen\r\nfor the nursing of dogs. But Florence was not to be baffled. To her great\r\ndelight she espied the shepherd’s smock hanging up behind the door. She\r\nwas a fearless soul, and felt no doubt whatever that her mother would\r\npay for a new smock. “This will just do,” she said, and, since that\r\ndelightful vicar gave a nod of entire approval, she promptly tore it into\r\nstrips.\r\n\r\nThen back to Cap’s hut she hastened, with her small henchman beside\r\nher carrying the kettle and the basin; for by this time he, the boy\r\nshepherd, began to be interested too, and the vicar’s superintendence was\r\nno longer needed. A message of explanation was sent to Embley that Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Nightingale might not be anxious, and for several hours Florence\r\ngave herself up to nursing her patient. Cap was passive in her hands, and\r\nthe hot fomentations gradually lessened the pain and the swelling.\r\n\r\nImagine the wonder and gratitude of old Roger when he turned up with\r\nthe rope in his hand and a leaden weight on his poor old heart! Cap,\r\nof course, knew his step and greeted him with a little whine of\r\nsatisfaction, as if to be the first to tell him the good news.\r\n\r\n“Why, missy, you have been doing wonders,” he said. “I never thought to\r\nsee t’ poor dog look up at me like that again.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” exclaimed the happy young nurse; “doesn’t he look better? Well,\r\nRoger, you can throw away the rope. I shall want you to help me make\r\nthese hot compresses.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Florence is quite right, Roger,” interposed the vicar; “you’ll\r\nsoon have Cap running about again.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I cannot thank you and the young lady enough, yer riv’rence.\r\nAnd I’ll mind all the instrooctions for he.”\r\n\r\nAs the faithful dog looked up at him, eased and content, it was a very\r\nhappy man that was old Roger. But the doctor-nurse was not prepared to\r\nlose her occupation too quickly.\r\n\r\n“I shall come and see him again to-morrow, Roger,” she said; “I know\r\nmamma will let me, when I just explain to her about it all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    _The weaving of many threads, both of evil and of good._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Florence Nightingale and her sister were working hard at history\r\nand languages and all useful feminine arts, romping in the sunny\r\nHampshire gardens, or riding amongst the Derbyshire hills, the big world\r\noutside their quiet paradise was heaping fuel for the fires of war,\r\nwhich at last, when after a quarter of a century it flared up out of its\r\nlong-prepared combustibles, was “to bring to death a million workmen and\r\nsoldiers, consume vast wealth, shatter the framework of the European\r\nsystem, and make it hard henceforth for any nation to be safe except by\r\nsheer strength.” And above all its devastation, remembered as a part of\r\nits undying record, the name of one of these happy children was to be\r\nblazoned on the page of history.\r\n\r\nAlready at the beginning of the century the first Napoleon had said that\r\nthe Czar of Russia was always threatening Constantinople and never taking\r\nit, and by the time Florence Nightingale was twelve years old, it might\r\nbe said of that Czar that while “holding the boundless authority of an\r\nOriental potentate,” his power was supplemented by the far-reaching\r\ntransmission of his orders across the telegraph wires, and if Kinglake\r\ndoes not exaggerate, “he would touch the bell and kindle a war, without\r\nhearing counsel from any living man.”\r\n\r\nThe project against Constantinople was a scheme of conquest continually\r\nto be delayed, but never discarded, and, happen what might, it was\r\nnever to be endured that the prospect of Russia’s attaining some day to\r\nthe Bosphorus should be shut out by the ambition of any other Power.\r\nNicholas was quite aware that multitudes of the pious throughout his\r\nvast dominions dwelt upon the thought of their co-religionists under\r\nthe Turkish rule, and looked to the shining cross of St. Sophia, symbol\r\nof their faith above the church founded by Constantine, as the goal of\r\npolitical unity for a “suppliant nation.”\r\n\r\nAnd Kinglake tells us with an almost acid irony of Louis Napoleon, that\r\nhe who was by the Senatus-Consulte of 1804 the statutory heir of the\r\ngreat Bonaparte, and after his exile and imprisonment had returned to\r\nFrance, laboured to show all men “how beautifully Nature in her infinite\r\nwisdom had adapted that same France to the service of the Bonapartes;\r\nand how, without the fostering care of these same Bonapartes, the\r\ncreature was doomed to degenerate, and to perish out of the world, and\r\nwas considering how it was possible at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury to make the coarse Bonaparte yoke of 1804 sit kindly upon her\r\nneck.”\r\n\r\nThe day was drawing near when a great war would seem to him to offer just\r\nthe opportunity he wanted.\r\n\r\nFar away as yet was that awful massacre of peaceful citizens in Paris in\r\n1851, with which the name of Louis Napoleon was associated as responsible\r\nfor the _coup d’état_—a massacre probably the result of brutal panic on\r\nthe part of the soldiers, the civilians, and that craven president,\r\nLouis Napoleon himself, whose conscience made a coward of him, and whose\r\nterror usually took the form of brutality—but long before that date, by\r\nhis callous plotting and underhand self-seeking, he was preparing forces\r\nwhich then made for death and terror, and by that time had more or less\r\nbroken the manhood of his beautiful Paris.\r\n\r\nYet all over the world at all times, while the enemy is sowing tares in\r\nthe field, the good seed is ripening also in the ground for the harvest;\r\nand through these same years far-off threads were being woven, ready to\r\nmake part of the warp and woof of a life, as yet busied with the duties\r\nand joys of childhood, but one day to thrill the hearts of Europe and be\r\nremembered while time shall last.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Fry, who was to be one of its decisive influences, was bringing\r\nnew light and hope into the noisome prisons of a bygone century, and we\r\nshall see how her life-work was not without its influence later on the\r\nlife of the child growing up at Embley and Lea Hurst.\r\n\r\nAnd a child nearly of Florence Nightingale’s own age, who was one day to\r\ncross her path with friendly help at an important crisis, was playing\r\nwith her sister Curlinda—Sir Walter Scott’s nickname for her real name\r\nof Caroline—and being drilled in manners in French schools in Paris and\r\nVersailles, before her family moved to Edinburgh and her more serious\r\nlessons began. This was Felicia Skene, who was afterwards able to give\r\nmomentary, but highly important help, at a critical moment in Florence\r\nNightingale’s career. Like Florence herself, she was born amid romantic\r\nsurroundings, though not in Italy but in Provence, and was named after\r\nher French godmother, a certain Comtesse de Felicité. Her two earliest\r\nrecollections were of the alarming and enraged gesticulations of Liszt\r\nwhen giving a music lesson to her frightened sisters, and the very\r\ndifferent vision of a lumbering coach and six accompanied by mounted\r\nsoldiers—the coach and six wherein sat Charles the Tenth, who was soon\r\nafterwards to take refuge in Holyrood. That was in Paris, where her\r\nfamily went to live when she was six years old, but at the time of Cap’s\r\naccident they had already moved to Edinburgh, where her chief friends and\r\nplaymates were the little Lockharts and the children of the murdered Duc\r\nde Berri. It was there that Sir Walter Scott, on the day when he heard of\r\nhis bankruptcy, came and sat quietly by the little Felicia, and bade her\r\ntell him fairy stories, as he didn’t want to talk much himself. He was an\r\nold and dear friend of her father, one link between them being the fact\r\nthat Mr. Skene was related by marriage to the beautiful Williamina Stuart\r\nwith whom Scott in his early days had fallen deeply and ardently in love.\r\n\r\nThe little Felicia was at this time a very lively child and full of\r\ninnocent mischief. Her later devotion to the sick and poor did not\r\nbegin so early as was the case with Florence Nightingale, though there\r\ncame a time when she and Florence met in after life as equals and\r\nfellow-soldiers in the great campaign against human suffering. Her\r\ntravels and adventures in Greece and her popularity at the Athenian\r\ncourt were still hidden in the future, and while Florence at Embley\r\nand Lea Hurst was gradually unfolding a sweetness of nature that was by\r\nno means blind to the humorous side of things, and a highly practical\r\nthoroughness in all she undertook, Felicia was enjoying a merry home-life\r\nunder the governorship of Miss Palmer, whom she nicknamed Pompey, and\r\nbeing prepared for confirmation by her father’s friend, Dean Ramsay. We\r\nare told of her that she might have said with Coppée, “J’ai eu toujours\r\nbesoin de Dieu.” Full of fun and of interest in life’s great adventure,\r\nfor others quite as much as for herself, religion was the moving force\r\nthat moulded the soul of her to much unforeseen self-sacrifice as yet\r\nundreamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    _The activities of girlhood—Elizabeth Fry—Felicia Skene again._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut we are wandering away from Embley and from the two daughters of the\r\nsquire, who were already the delight of the village.\r\n\r\nCap was by no means the only animal who owed much to Florence, and Peggy,\r\na favourite old pony, now holiday-making in the paddock, looked for\r\nfrequent visits and much sport between lesson hours.\r\n\r\n“Poor old Peggy, then; would she like a carrot?”\r\n\r\n“Well, where is it, then? See if you can find it, Peggy.”\r\n\r\nAnd then a little game followed, to which the beloved pony was quite\r\naccustomed—snuffing round her young mistress and being teased and\r\ntantalized for a minute or two, just to heighten the coming pleasure,\r\nuntil at last the pocket was found where the precious delicacy was\r\nhidden, and the daily feast began, a feast not of carrots only, for\r\ncaresses were of course a part of the ritual.\r\n\r\nFlorence had much good fellowship also with the wild squirrels of the\r\nneighbourhood, especially in one long avenue that was their favourite\r\nabode. They were not in the least afraid of her, and would come leaping\r\ndown after the nuts that she dropped for them as she walked along.\r\nSometimes she would turn sharp round and startle them back into their\r\nhomes, but it was easy to tempt them down again. She was quick at finding\r\nand guarding the nests of brooding birds, and suffered very keenly as a\r\nchild when the young ones were taken away from their mothers.\r\n\r\nLambs and calves soon learned that she was fond of them, and the\r\naffection was not on her side only. But among the pets that the two girls\r\nwere allowed to have, the ailing ones were always the most interesting to\r\nthe future nurse.\r\n\r\nIt cannot, however, be too strongly stated that there was nothing\r\nsentimental or lackadaisical in the very vigorous and hard-working life\r\nthat she led. It was not by any means all songs and roses, though it\r\nwas full of the happiness of a well-ordered and loving existence. Her\r\nfather was a rigid disciplinarian, and nothing casual or easygoing was\r\nallowed in the Embley schoolroom. For any work carelessly done there was\r\npunishment as well as reproof, and no shamming of any sort was allowed.\r\nHours must be punctually kept, and, whether the lesson for the moment was\r\nLatin, Greek, or mathematics, or the sewing of a fine and exquisite seam,\r\nit must come up to the necessary standard and be satisfactorily done. The\r\nmaster-mind that so swiftly transformed the filthy horrors of Scutari\r\ninto a well-ordered hospital, and could dare to walk through minor\r\ndifficulties and objections as though they did not exist, was educated\r\nin a severe and early school; and the striking modesty and gentleness of\r\nFlorence Nightingale’s girlhood was the deeper for having grappled with\r\nenough real knowledge to know its own ignorances and limitations, and\r\ntreat the personality of others with a deference which was a part of her\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nAnd if study was made a serious business, the sisters enjoyed to the\r\nfull the healthy advantages of country life. They scampered about the\r\npark with their dogs, rode their ponies over hill and dale, spent long\r\ndays in the woods among the bluebells and primroses, and in summer\r\ntumbled about in the sweet-scented hay. “During the summer at Lea Hurst,\r\nlessons were a little relaxed in favour of outdoor life; but on the\r\nreturn to Embley for the winter, schoolroom routine was again enforced on\r\nvery strict lines.”[3]\r\n\r\nIn Florence Nightingale’s Derbyshire home the experiments in methods of\r\nhealing which dispensed with drugs could not fail to arouse attention\r\nand discussion, for Mr. John Smedley’s newly-built cure-house stood at\r\nthe foot of the hill below Lea Hurst, and before Florence Nightingale\r\nwas twenty she had already begun to turn her attention definitely in the\r\ndirection of nursing. Everything tended to deepen this idea. She was\r\nalready able to do much for the villagers, and in any case of illness\r\nthey were always eager to let her know. The consumptive girl whose room\r\nshe gladdened with flowers was but one of the many ailing folk who found\r\ncomfort and joy in her presence. “Miss Florence had a way with her that\r\nmade them feel better,” they said.\r\n\r\nIn those days nursing as a profession did not exist. When it was not done\r\nwholly for love by the unselfish maiden aunt or sister, who was supposed,\r\nas a matter of course, to be always at the disposal of the sick people\r\namong her kinsfolk, it had come to be too often a mere callous trade,\r\ncarried on by ignorant and grasping women, who were not even clean or\r\nof good character. The turning of a Scutari hell into a hospital that\r\nseemed heaven by comparison, was a smaller miracle than that which Miss\r\nNightingale’s influence was destined later to achieve in changing a\r\ndespised and brutalized occupation throughout a whole empire into a noble\r\nand distinguished art.\r\n\r\nOf course it must never be forgotten that through all the centuries since\r\nthe Christian Church was founded, there had been Catholic sisterhoods\r\nwith whom the real and the ideal were one—Sisters of Mercy, who were\r\nnot only refined and cultivated gentlewomen, but the most devoted and\r\nself-sacrificing of human souls.\r\n\r\nAnd now in England, in that Society of Friends, which among Christian\r\ncommunities might seem outwardly farthest away from a communion valuing\r\nas its very language the ancient symbols and ritual of the Catholic\r\nChurch, yet was perhaps by its obedience to the inward voice more in\r\nsympathy with the sisterhoods of that Church than were many other\r\nreligious groups, there had been lifted up by Elizabeth Fry a new\r\nstandard of duty in this matter, which in her hands became a new standard\r\nof nursing, to be passed on in old age by her saintly hands into the\r\nyoung and powerful grasp of the brilliant girl who is the heroine of\r\nour story. The name of Elizabeth Fry is associated with the reform of\r\nour prisons, but it is less commonly known that she was also a pioneer\r\nof decent nursing. She understood with entire simplicity the words, “I\r\nwas sick and in prison, and ye visited me.” Perhaps it was not mere\r\ncoincidence that the words occur in the “lesson” appointed for the 15th\r\nof February—the day noted in Elizabeth Fry’s journal as the date of that\r\nvisit to Newgate, when the poor felons she was yearning to help fell on\r\ntheir knees and prayed to a divine unseen Presence. In a recent number of\r\nthe _Times_ which celebrates her centenary a quotation from her diary is\r\ngiven which tells in her own words:—\r\n\r\n    “I heard weeping, and I thought they appeared much tendered;\r\n    a very solemn quiet was observed; it was a striking scene,\r\n    the poor people on their knees around us, in their deplorable\r\n    condition.”\r\n\r\nAnd the _Times_ goes on to say, “nothing appears but those qualities of\r\nhelpfulness, sympathy, and love which could tame the most savage natures,\r\nsilence the voice of profanity and blasphemy, and subdue all around her\r\nby a sense of her common sisterhood even with the vilest of them in the\r\nlove of God and the service of man.... But the deepest note of her nature\r\nwas an intense enthusiasm of humanity. It was this which inspired and\r\nsustained all her efforts from first to last—even in her earlier and more\r\nfrivolous days—for the welfare and uplifting of her fellow-creatures;\r\nand it is only right to add that it was itself sustained by her deep and\r\nabiding conviction that it is only by the love of God that the service\r\nof man can be sanctified and made to prosper.” A letter followed next\r\nday from Mr. Julian Hill, who actually remembers her, and tells how the\r\nInstitution of Nursing Sisters which she organized grew out of her deep\r\npity for the victims of Sairey Gamp and her kind.\r\n\r\nAll this was preparing the way for the wider and more successful nursing\r\ncrusade in which her memory and influence were to inspire the brave young\r\nsoul of Florence Nightingale. Speaking of all the difficulties that a\r\nblindly conventional world is always ready to throw in the way of any\r\nsuch new path, her old friend writes: “Such difficulties Mrs. Fry and\r\nMiss Nightingale brushed contemptuously aside.”\r\n\r\nBut in our story Miss Nightingale is as yet only lately out of the\r\nschoolroom. And Elizabeth Fry’s life was by no means alone, as we have\r\nseen, in its preparation of her appointed path, for about the time that\r\nFlorence Nightingale was taking her place in the brilliant society that\r\nmet about her father’s board, and Felicia Skene was “coming out,” a new\r\nexperiment was being made by a devout member of the Lutheran Church, an\r\nexperiment which was to play an important part in the world’s history,\r\nthough so quietly and unobtrusively carried out.\r\n\r\nWe must not anticipate—we shall read of that in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    _Home duties and pleasures—The brewing of war._\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence was very happy as her mother’s almoner, and in her modest and\r\nunobtrusive way was the life and soul of the village festivities that\r\ncentred in the church and school and were planned in many instances by\r\nher father and mother. It is one of the happy characteristics of our time\r\nthat much innocent grace and merriment have been revived in the teaching\r\nof beautiful old morris dances and other peasant festivities that had\r\nbeen banished by the rigour of a perverted Puritanism, and the squire of\r\nLea Hurst and his wife were before their time in such matters. There was\r\na yearly function of prize-giving and speech-making and dancing, known\r\nas the children’s “Feast Day,” to which the scholars came in procession\r\nto the Hall, with their wreaths and garlands, to the music of a good\r\nmarching band provided by the squire, and afterwards they had tea in\r\nthe fields below the Hall garden, served by Mrs. Nightingale and her\r\ndaughters and the Hall servants, and then ended their day with merry\r\noutdoor dancing. For the little ones Florence planned all kinds of games;\r\nthe children, indeed, were her special care, and by the time the evening\r\nsun was making pomp of gold and purple in the sky above the valley of\r\nthe Derwent, there came the crowning event of the day when on the garden\r\nterrace the two daughters of the house distributed their gifts to the\r\nhappy scholars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tooley in her biography calls up for us in a line or two a vision\r\nof Florence as she was remembered by one old lady, who had often been\r\npresent and recalled her slender charm, herself as sweet as the rose\r\nwhich she often wore in her neatly braided hair, brown hair with a glint\r\nof gold in it, glossy and smooth and characteristic of youth and health.\r\nWe have from one and another a glimpse of the harmonious simplicity also\r\nof her dress—the soft muslin gown, the little silk fichu crossed upon\r\nher breast, the modest Leghorn bonnet with its rose. Or in winter, riding\r\nabout in the neighbourhood of Embley and distributing her little personal\r\ngifts at Christmas among the old women—tea and warm petticoats—her\r\n“ermine tippet and muff and beaver hat.”\r\n\r\nShe helped in the training of young voices in the village, and was\r\namong the entertainers when the carol-singers enjoyed their mince-pies\r\nand annual coins in the hall. The workhouse knew her well, and any\r\nwise enterprise in the neighbourhood for help or healing among the\r\npoor and the sad was sure of her presence and of all the co-operation\r\nin the power of her neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Herbert, with whom\r\nfor some years before the Crimea she shared much companionship in such\r\nwork. This friendship was an important influence in our heroine’s life,\r\nfor Mr. Herbert was of those who reveal to the dullest a little of the\r\ndivine beauty and love, and his wife was through all their married life\r\nhis faithful and devoted friend, so that they made a strong trio of\r\nsympathetic workers; for “Liz,” as her husband usually called her in his\r\nletters to their common friend Florence Nightingale, seemed to have fully\r\nshared his unbounded faith in the noble powers and high aims of the said\r\nFlorence, whom she too loved and admired. She was a daughter of General\r\nCharles Ashe à Court, and she and Sidney Herbert had known one another as\r\nchildren. Indeed, it was in those early days, when she was quite a little\r\nchild, that Elizabeth, who grew up to be one of the most beautiful women\r\nof her day, said of Sidney, then, of course, a mere boy, that that was\r\nthe boy she was going to marry, and that she would never marry any one\r\nelse. Many a long year, however, had rolled between before he rode over\r\nto Amington from Drayton, where he often met her, though no longer such\r\nnear neighbours as in the early Wiltshire days, and asked the beautiful\r\nElizabeth to be his wife. The intimacy between the two families had never\r\nceased, and General à Court, himself member for Wilton, had worked hard\r\nfor Sidney’s first election for the county. We shall hear more of these\r\ndear and early friends of Florence Nightingale as her story unfolds, but\r\nlet us turn now for a moment to herself.\r\n\r\nHer life was many-sided, and her devotion to good works did not arise\r\nfrom any lack of knowledge of the world. She was presented, of course,\r\nlike other girls of her order, and had her “seasons” in London as well\r\nas her share in country society. A young and lovely girl, whose father\r\nhad been wise enough to give her all the education and advantages of\r\na promising boy, and who excelled also in every distinctive feminine\r\naccomplishment and “pure womanliness,” had her earthly kingdom at her\r\nfeet. But her soul was more and more deeply bent on a life spent in\r\nservice and consecrated to the good of others. Her Sunday class, in the\r\nold building known as the “Chapel” at Lea Hurst, was but one of her many\r\nefforts in her father’s special domain in Derbyshire, and girls of every\r\nfaith came to her there without distinction of creed. They were mostly\r\nworkers in the hosiery mills owned by John Smedley, and many of them,\r\nlike their master, were Methodists. She sang to them, and they still\r\nremember the sweetness of her voice and “how beautifully Miss Florence\r\nused to talk,” as they sat together through many a sunny afternoon in the\r\ntiny stone building overlooking Lea Hurst gardens. Cromford Church, built\r\nby Sir Richard Arkwright, was then comparatively new, and time had not\r\nmade of it the pretty picture that it is now, in its bosoming trees above\r\nthe river; but it played a considerable part in Florence Nightingale’s\r\nyouth, when the vicar and the Arkwright of her day—old Sir Richard’s\r\ntomb in the chancel bears the earlier date of 1792—organized many a kind\r\nscheme for the good of the parish, in which the squire’s two daughters\r\ngave their help.\r\n\r\nBut Miss Nightingale was not of a type to consider these amateur\r\npleasures a sufficient training for her life-work, and that life-work was\r\nalready taking a more or less definite shape in her mind.\r\n\r\nShe herself has written:—\r\n\r\n    “I would say to all young ladies who are called to any\r\n    particular vocation, qualify yourselves for it as a man does\r\n    for his work. Don’t think you can undertake it otherwise.\r\n    Submit yourselves to the rules of business as men do, by which\r\n    alone you can make God’s business succeed, for He has never\r\n    said that He will give His success and His blessing to sketchy\r\n    and unfinished work.” And on another occasion she wrote that\r\n    “three-fourths of the whole mischief in women’s lives arises\r\n    from their excepting themselves from the rules of training\r\n    considered needful for men.”\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that her thought was more and more directed\r\ntowards nursing, and in various ways she was quietly preparing herself to\r\nthat end.\r\n\r\nHer interview with the Quaker-saint, Elizabeth Fry, though deliberately\r\nsought and of abiding effect, was but a brief episode. It was about\r\nthis time that they met in London. The serene old Quakeress, through\r\nwhose countenance looked forth such a heavenly soul, was no doubt keenly\r\ninterested in the ardent, witty, beautiful girl who came to her for\r\ninspiration and counsel. They had much in common, and who knows but the\r\nolder woman, with all her weight of experience, her saintly character,\r\nand ripened harvest, may yet in some ways have felt herself the younger\r\nof the two; for she had come to that quiet threshold of the life beyond,\r\nwhere a soul like hers has part in the simple joys of the Divine Child,\r\nand looks tenderly on those who are still in the fires of battle through\r\nwhich they have passed.\r\n\r\nHer own girlhood had defied in innocent ways the strictness of the Quaker\r\nrule. Imagine a young Quakeress of those days wearing, as she had done on\r\noccasion, a red riding habit!\r\n\r\nShe had been fond of dancing, and would have, I suspect, a very healthy\r\nhuman interest in the activities of a girl in Society, though she would\r\nenter into Florence Nightingale’s resolve that her life should not be\r\nfrittered away in a self-centred round, while men and women, for whom her\r\nMaster died, were themselves suffering a slow death in workhouses and\r\nprisons and hospitals, with none to tend their wounds of soul and body.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may—and without a record of their conversation it is easy\r\nto go astray in imagining—we do know that like all the greatest saints\r\nthey were both very practical in their Christianity, and did not care\r\ntoo much what was thought of their actions, so long as they were right\r\nin the sight of God. In their common sense, their humility, their warm,\r\nquick-beating heart of humanity, they were kindred spirits.\r\n\r\nThe interview bore fruit even outwardly afterwards in a very important\r\nway. For it was from Elizabeth Fry that Florence Nightingale first heard\r\nof Pastor Fliedner and his institute for training nurses at Kaiserswerth,\r\nas well as of Elizabeth Fry’s own institute for a like purpose in London,\r\nwhich first suggested the Kaiserswerth training home, thus returning in\r\never-widening blessing the harvest of its seed.\r\n\r\nHer desire was for definite preparatory knowledge and discipline, and\r\nwe of this generation can hardly realize how much searching must have\r\nbeen necessary before the adequate training could be found. Certificated\r\nnursing is now a commonplace, and we forget that it dates from Miss\r\nNightingale’s efforts after her return from the Crimea. We have only\r\nto turn to the life of Felicia Skene and her lonely labour of love at\r\nthe time when the cholera visited Oxford—some twelve years later than\r\nFlorence Nightingale’s seventeenth birthday, that is to say, in 1849-51,\r\nand again in 1854—to gain some idea of the bareness of the field. Sir\r\nHenry Acland, whose intimate friendship with Felicia dates from their\r\ncommon labours among the cholera patients, has described one among the\r\nterrible cases for which there would, it seems, have been no human aid,\r\nbut for their discovery of the patient’s neglected helplessness.\r\n\r\n    “She had no blanket,” he says, “or any covering but the ragged\r\n    cotton clothes she had on. She rolled screaming. One woman,\r\n    scarcely sober, sat by; she sat with a pipe in her mouth,\r\n    looking on. To treat her in this state was hopeless. She was\r\n    to be removed. There was a press of work at the hospital, and\r\n    a delay. When the carriers came, her saturated garments were\r\n    stripped off, and in the finer linen and in the blankets of a\r\n    wealthier woman she was borne away, and in the hospital she\r\n    died.”\r\n\r\nThis is given, it would seem, as but one case among hundreds.\r\n\r\nThree old cattle-sheds were turned into a sort of impromptu hospital, to\r\nwhich some of the smallpox and cholera patients were carried, and the\r\nclergy, especially Mr. Charles Marriott and Mr. Venables, did all they\r\ncould for old and young alike, seconding the doctors, with Sir Henry\r\nat their head, in cheering and helping every one in the stricken town;\r\nand Miss Skene’s friend, Miss Hughes, Sister Marion, directed the women\r\ncalled in to help, who there received a kind of rough-and-ready training.\r\nBut more overwhelming still was Miss Skene’s own work of home nursing\r\nin the cottages, at first single-handed, and afterwards at the head of\r\na band of women engaged by the deputy chairman as her servants in the\r\nwork, of whom many were ignorant and needed training. “By day and by\r\nnight she visited,” writes Sir Henry. “She plied this task, and when she\r\nrested—or where as long at least as she knew of a house where disease had\r\nentered—is known to herself alone.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a critical moment had arisen in the affairs of Europe. Our\r\nown Premier, Lord Aberdeen, had long been regarded as the very head and\r\nfront of the Peace Movement in England, and when he succeeded the wary\r\nLord Palmerston, it is said that Nicholas, the Czar of Russia, made no\r\nsecret of his pleasure in the event, for he saw tokens in England of\r\nwhat might at least leave him a chance of pulling Turkey to pieces.\r\nHe seems also to have had a great personal liking for our ambassador,\r\nSir Hamilton Seymour, who was fortunately a man of honour as well as a\r\nman of discretion and ready wit. The account given by Kinglake of the\r\nconversations in which the Emperor Nicholas disclosed his views, and\r\nwas not permitted to hint them merely, makes very dramatic reading. The\r\nCzar persisted in speaking of Turkey as a very sick man, whose affairs\r\nhad better be taken out of his hands by his friends before his final\r\ndissolution. Sir Hamilton courteously intimated that England did not\r\ntreat her allies in that manner; but Nicholas was not to be put off, and\r\nat a party given by the Grand Duchess Hereditary on February 20, 1853, he\r\nagain took Sir Hamilton apart, and in a very gracious and confidential\r\nmanner closed his conversation with the words, “I repeat to you that the\r\nsick man is dying, and we can never allow such an event to take us by\r\nsurprise. We must come to some understanding.”\r\n\r\nThe next day he explained how the partition should in his opinion\r\nbe made. Servia and Bulgaria should be independent states under his\r\nprotection. England should have Egypt and Candia. He had already made\r\nit clear that he should expect us to pledge ourselves not to occupy\r\nConstantinople, though he could not himself give us a like undertaking.\r\n\r\n“As I did not wish,” writes Sir Hamilton Seymour, “that the Emperor\r\nshould imagine that an English public servant was caught by this sort\r\nof overture, I simply answered that I had always understood that the\r\nEnglish views upon Egypt did not go beyond the point of securing a safe\r\nand ready communication between British India and the mother country.\r\n‘Well,’ said the Emperor, ‘induce your Government to write again upon\r\nthese subjects, to write more fully, and to do so without hesitation. I\r\nhave confidence in the English Government. It is not an engagement, a\r\nconvention, which I ask of them; it is a free interchange of ideas, and\r\nin case of need the word of a “gentleman”—that is enough between us.’”\r\n\r\nIn reply, our Government disclaimed all idea of aiming at any of the\r\nSultan’s possessions, or considering the Ottoman Empire ready to fall to\r\nbits; and while accepting the Emperor’s word that he would not himself\r\ngrab any part of it, refused most decisively to enter on any secret\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nAll through 1853 these parleyings were kept secret, and in the meantime\r\nthe Czar had failed in his rôle of tempter. In the interval the Sultan,\r\nwho perhaps had gained some inkling of what was going on, suddenly\r\nyielded to Austria’s demand that he should withdraw certain troops that\r\nhad been harassing Montenegro, and thereby rousing the Czar’s religious\r\nzeal on behalf of his co-religionists in that province. Everything for\r\nthe moment lulled his previous intention of a war against Turkey.\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor Louis Napoleon had in cold blood been driving a wedge\r\ninto the peace of the world by reviving a treaty of 1740, which had given\r\nto Latin monks a key to the chief door of the Church of Bethlehem, as\r\nwell as the keys to the two doors of the Sacred Manger, and also the\r\nright to place a silver star adorned with the arms of France in the\r\nSanctuary of the Nativity. That the Churches should fight for the key to\r\nthe supposed birthplace of the Prince of Peace is indeed grotesque. But\r\nthe old temple had in His day become a den of thieves; and even the new\r\ntemple, built through His own loving sacrifice, is ever being put to uses\r\nthat are childish and greedy.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand that, by means of this treaty,\r\nawakening the vanity and greed that cloak themselves under more decent\r\nfeelings in such rivalries, Louis Napoleon made his profit for the\r\nmoment out of the powers of evil.\r\n\r\nThe Czar’s jealousy for his own empire’s Greek version of the faith made\r\nthe triumph of this treaty wormwood to him and to his people. “To the\r\nindignation,” Count Nesselrode writes, “of the whole people following the\r\nGreek ritual, the key of the Church of Bethlehem has been made over to\r\nthe Latins, so as publicly to demonstrate their religious supremacy in\r\nthe East.” ...\r\n\r\n    “A crowd of monks with bare foreheads,” says Kinglake, “stood\r\n    quarrelling for a key at the sunny gates of a church in\r\n    Palestine, but beyond and above, towering high in the misty\r\n    North, men saw the ambition of the Czars.”\r\n\r\nThe Czars did not stand alone: “some fifty millions of men in Russia held\r\none creed, and they held it too with the earnestness of which Western\r\nEurope used to have experience in earlier times.... They knew that in the\r\nTurkish dominions there were ten or fourteen millions of men holding\r\nexactly the same faith as themselves ... they had heard tales of the\r\nsufferings of these their brethren which seemed,” they blindly thought,\r\n“to call for vengeance.”\r\n\r\nNicholas himself was a fanatic on such questions, and the end of it\r\nwas that his rage hoodwinked his conscience, and he stole a march upon\r\nEngland and France, which destroyed their trust in his honour. He had\r\nalready gathered troops in the south, to say nothing of a fleet in the\r\nEuxine; and having determined on an embassy to Constantinople, he chose\r\nMentschikoff as his messenger, a man who was said to hate the Turks and\r\ndislike the English, and who, according to Kinglake, was a wit rather\r\nthan a diplomat or a soldier. Advancing with much of the pomp of war, and\r\ndisregarding much of the etiquette of peace, his arrival and behaviour\r\ncaused such a panic in the Turkish capital that Colonel Rose was besought\r\nto take an English fleet to the protection of the Ottoman Empire.\r\nColonel Rose’s friendly willingness, though afterwards cancelled by our\r\nHome Government, at once quieted the terror in Constantinople; but the\r\nEmperor of the French cast oil upon the smouldering flame by sending a\r\nfleet to Salamis. This greatly angered Nicholas, and, although he was\r\npleased to find England disapproved of what France had done, Mentschikoff\r\noffered a secret treaty to Turkey, with ships and men, if she ever needed\r\nhelp, and asked in return for complete control of the Greek Church. This\r\nbroke all his promises to the Western Powers, and England at once was\r\nmade aware of it by the Turkish minister.\r\n\r\nPrince Mentschikoff meanwhile drew to himself an army, and the English\r\nVice-consul at Galatz reported that in Bessarabia preparations were\r\nalready made for the passage of 120,000 men, while battalions from all\r\ndirections were making southward—the fleet was even then at Sebastopol.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale.\r\n\r\n(_From the painting in the National Portrait Gallery by Augustus Egg,\r\nR.A._)]\r\n\r\nThe double-dealing of Russia was met by a gradual and tacit alliance\r\nbetween England and the Sultan; and Lord Aberdeen, whose love of peace\r\nhas been described by one historian as “passionate” and “fanatical,” was\r\nunknowingly tying his own hands by the advice he gave in his despatches\r\nwhen consulted by Turkey. Moreover, in Turkey, our ambassador, Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe, stiffened the back of Ottoman resistance against\r\nthe Czar’s wily handling of “the sick man.” Lord Stratford’s tact and\r\nforce of character had moulded all to his will, and our admiral at Malta\r\nwas told to obey any directions he received from him. Our fleets were\r\nordered into the neighbourhood of the Dardanelles, and Lord Stratford\r\nheld his watch at Therapia against the gathering wrath of the Czar. Only\r\na very little kindling touch was needed to light the fires of a terrible\r\nconflict in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    _Pastor Fliedner._\r\n\r\n\r\nA pebble thrown into a lake sends the tiny circling ripples very far,\r\nand one good piece of work leads to others of a quite different kind.\r\nPastor Fliedner, inspired by love to his Master and deeply interested\r\nin Elizabeth Fry’s efforts, began to help prisoners. Finding no nurses\r\nfor those of them who were ill, he was led to found the institution at\r\nKaiserswerth, where Miss Nightingale afterwards received a part of her\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nHis story is a beautiful one. His father and grandfather had both been\r\npastors in the Lutheran Church, and, like so many sons of the Manse, he\r\nwas exceedingly poor, but he lived to justify his name of Theodor. He was\r\nborn twenty years before Miss Nightingale, in the village of Eppstein,\r\nand perhaps he was the more determined to prove to himself and others\r\nthat he had a soul, because he was one of those plump children who\r\nget teased for looking like dumplings, and when his father laughingly\r\ncalled him the “little beer-brewer” he didn’t like it, for he was a bit\r\nthin-skinned. He worked his way bravely through school and college,\r\nGiessen and Göttingen, and not only earned his fees by teaching, but also\r\nhis bread and roof; and when teaching was not enough, he had the good\r\nsense to turn shoeblack and carpenter and odd man. He valued all that\r\nopens the eyes of the mind and educates what is highest and best. Many\r\na time, heedless of hardship and privation, he would, in his holidays,\r\ntramp long distances that he might see more of God’s world and learn\r\nmore of men and things. He taught himself in this way to speak several\r\nlanguages, learned the useful healing properties of many herbs, and\r\nother homely knowledge that afterwards helped him in his work among the\r\nsick. Then, too, the games and songs that he picked up on his travels\r\nafterwards enriched his own kindergarten. While tutoring at Cologne,\r\nhe did quite informally some of the work of a curate, and, through\r\npreaching sometimes in the prison, became interested in the lot of\r\ndischarged prisoners. It was at Cologne too that he received from the\r\nmother of his pupils kindly suggestions as to his own manners, which\r\nled him to write what is as true as it is quaint, that “gentle ways and\r\npolite manners help greatly to further the Kingdom of God.”\r\n\r\nHe was only twenty-two when he became pastor of the little Protestant\r\nflock at Kaiserswerth, having walked there on foot and purposely taken\r\nhis parishioners by surprise that they might not be put to the expense\r\nof a formal welcome. His yearly salary was only twenty pounds, and he\r\nhelped his widowed mother by sharing the parsonage with a sister and two\r\nyounger brothers, though in any case he had to house the mother of the\r\nman who had been there before him. Then came a failure in the business\r\nof the little town—the making of velvet—and though there were other rich\r\ncommunities that would have liked to claim him, he was true to his own\r\nimpoverished flock, and set forth like a pilgrim in search of aid for\r\nthem. In this apostolic journey he visited Holland and England as well\r\nas Germany, and it was in London that, in Elizabeth Fry, he found a noble\r\nkindred spirit, much older, of course, than himself, as we count the time\r\nof earth, but still full of all the tender enthusiasm of love’s immortal\r\nyouth. Her wonderful work among the prisoners of Newgate sent him back to\r\nhis own parish all on fire to help the prisoners of his own country, and\r\nhe began at once with Düsseldorf, the prison nearest home. Through him\r\nwas founded the first German organization for improving the discipline of\r\nprisons.\r\n\r\nMost of all he wanted to help the women who on leaving the prison doors\r\nwere left without roof or protector.\r\n\r\nWith his own hands he made clean his old summer-house, and in this\r\nshelter—twelve feet square—which he had furnished with a bed, a chair,\r\nand a table, he asked the All-father to lead some poor outcast to the\r\nlittle home he had made for her.\r\n\r\nIt was at night that for the first time a poor forlorn creature came\r\nin answer to that prayer, and he and his wife led her in to the place\r\nprepared for her. Nine others followed, and, by the time the number had\r\nrisen to twenty, a new building was ready for them with its own field and\r\ngarden, and Fliedner’s wife, helped by Mademoiselle Gobel, who gave her\r\nservices “all for love and nothing for reward,” had charge of the home,\r\nwhere many a one who, like the woman in the Gospel, “had been a great\r\nsinner” began to lead a new life and to follow Christ.\r\n\r\nFor the children of some of these women a kindergarten arose; but the\r\nwork of all others on which the pastor’s heart was set was the training\r\nof women to nurse and tend the poor; for in his own parish, where there\r\nwas much illness and ignorance, there was no one to do this. Three years\r\nafter his earlier venture, in 1836 when Miss Nightingale in her far-away\r\nhome was a girl of sixteen still more or less in the schoolroom, this new\r\nundertaking was begun, this quiet haven, from which her own great venture\r\nlong afterwards took help and teaching, was built up by this German saint.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the velvet industry at Kaiserswerth, in the pastor’s\r\nfirst year, had left an empty factory which he turned into a hospital.\r\n\r\nBut when it was opened, the faith needed was much like the faith of\r\nAbraham when great blessing was promised to a son whom the world thought\r\nhe would never possess; for the Deaconess Hospital, when the wards were\r\nfitted up by its pastor with “mended furniture and cracked earthenware,”\r\nhad as yet no patients and no deaconesses.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one essential of a good hospital which can be bought\r\nby labour as well as by money; and by hard work the hospital was kept\r\nadmirably clean.\r\n\r\nThe first patient who knocked at its doors was a servant girl, and\r\nother patients followed so quickly that within the first year sixty\r\npatients were nursed there and seven nurses had entered as deaconess and\r\nprobationers. All the deaconesses were to be over twenty-five, and though\r\nthey entered for five years, they could leave at any moment. The code\r\nof rules drawn up by the pastor was very simple, and there were not any\r\nvows; but the form of admission was a solemn one and included the laying\r\non of hands, while the pastor invoked the Threefold Name, saying: “May\r\nGod the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, three Persons in one God,\r\nbless you; may He stablish you in the Truth until death, and give you\r\nhereafter the Crown of Life. Amen.”\r\n\r\nIt all had a kind of homely grace, even in outward things. The\r\ndeaconesses wore a large white turned-down collar over a blue cotton\r\ngown, a white muslin cap tied on under the chin with a large bow, and a\r\nwhite apron—a dress so well suited to the work that young and old both\r\nlooked more than usually sweet and womanly in it.\r\n\r\nThe story of how the deaconesses found a head, and Fliedner a second\r\nhelper after the death of his first wife, reads rather like a Hans\r\nAndersen fairy tale.\r\n\r\nHe travelled to Hamburg to ask Amalie Sievekin to take charge of the\r\nHome, and as she could not do so, she advised him to go to her friend and\r\npupil Caroline Berthean, who had had experience of nursing in the Hamburg\r\nHospital.\r\n\r\nThe pastor was so pleased with Miss Caroline that he then and there\r\noffered her the choice of becoming either his wife or the Superintendent\r\nof the Deaconesses’ Home.\r\n\r\nShe said she would fill _both_ the vacant places, and their honeymoon was\r\nspent in Berlin that they might “settle” the first five deaconesses in\r\nthe Charité Hospital.\r\n\r\nCaroline, young though she was, made a good Deaconess Mother,[4] and she\r\nseems also to have been an excellent wife, full of devotion to the work\r\nher husband loved, through all the rest of her life. The deaconesses give\r\ntheir work, and in a sense give themselves. They do not pay for their\r\nboard, but neither are they paid for their work, though they are allowed\r\na very simple yearly outfit of two cotton gowns and aprons, and every\r\nfive years a new _best_ dress of blue woollen material and an apron of\r\nblack alpaca. Also their outdoor garb of a long black cloak and bonnet\r\nis supplied to them, and each is allowed a little pocket money. Their\r\nprivate property remains their own to control as they please, whether\r\nthey live or die.\r\n\r\nThe little account of Kaiserswerth which Miss Nightingale wrote is most\r\nrare and precious, having long been out of print, but from the copy in\r\nthe British Museum I transfer a few sentences to these pages, because of\r\ntheir quaintness and their interest for all who are feeling their way in\r\nthe education of young children:—\r\n\r\n    “In the Orphan Asylum,” wrote Miss Nightingale, “each family\r\n    lives with its deaconess exactly as her children. Some of\r\n    them have already become deaconesses or teachers, some have\r\n    returned home. When a new child is admitted, a little feast\r\n    celebrates its arrival, at which the pastor himself presides,\r\n    who understands children so well that his presence, instead of\r\n    being a constraint, serves to make the little new-comer feel\r\n    herself at home. She chooses what is to be sung, she has a\r\n    little present from the pastor, and, after tea, at the end of\r\n    the evening, she is prayed for....\r\n\r\n    “One morning, in the boys’ ward, as they were about to have\r\n    prayers, just before breakfast, two of the boys quarrelled\r\n    about a hymn book. The ‘sister’ was uncertain, for a moment,\r\n    what to do. They could not pray in that state of mind, yet\r\n    excluding them from the prayer was not likely to improve them.\r\n    She told a story of her own childhood, how one night she had\r\n    been cross with her parents, and, putting off her prayers till\r\n    she felt good again, had fallen asleep. The children were quite\r\n    silent for a moment and shocked at the idea that anybody should\r\n    go to bed without praying. The two boys were reconciled, and\r\n    prayers took place....”\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum also is a copy of the following letter:—\r\n\r\n    “MESSRS. DUBAW,—A gentleman called here yesterday from you,\r\n    asking for a copy of my ‘Kaiserswerth’ for, I believe, the\r\n    British Museum.\r\n\r\n    “Since yesterday a search has been instituted—but only two\r\n    copies have been found, and one of those is torn and dirty. I\r\n    send you the least bad-looking. You will see the date is 1851,\r\n    and after the copies then printed were given away I don’t think\r\n    I have ever thought of it.\r\n\r\n    “I was twice in training there myself. Of course, since then\r\n    hospital and district nursing have made great strides. Indeed,\r\n    district nursing has been invented.\r\n\r\n    “But never have I met with a higher love, a purer devotion than\r\n    there. There was no neglect.\r\n\r\n    “It was the more remarkable because many of the deaconesses had\r\n    been only peasants (none were gentlewomen when I was there).\r\n\r\n    “The food was poor—no coffee but bean coffee—no luxury but\r\n    cleanliness.\r\n\r\n                                            “FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    _Years of preparation._\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale, like Felicia Skene, had that saving gift of humour\r\nwhich at times may make bearable an otherwise unbearable keenness of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nHere, for instance, is her account of the customary dusting of a room\r\nin those days (is it always nowadays so entirely different as might be\r\nwished?):—\r\n\r\n    “Having witnessed the morning process called ‘tidying the\r\n    room’ for many years, and with ever-increasing astonishment,\r\n    I can describe what it is. From the chairs, tables, or sofa,\r\n    upon which ‘things’ have lain during the night, and which are\r\n    therefore comparatively clean from dust or blacks, the poor\r\n    ‘things’ having ‘caught it,’ they are removed to other chairs,\r\n    tables, sofas, upon which you could write your name with your\r\n    finger in the dust or blacks. The other side of the things is\r\n    therefore now evenly dirtied or dusted. The housemaid then\r\n    flaps everything or some things not out of her reach with a\r\n    thing called a duster—the dust flies up, then resettles more\r\n    equally than it lay before the operation. The room has now been\r\n    ‘put to rights.’”\r\n\r\nYou see the shrewd humour of that observation touches the smallest\r\ndetail. Miss Nightingale never wasted time in unpractical theorizing. In\r\ndiscussing the far-off attainment of ideal nursing she says:—\r\n\r\n    “Will the top of Mont Blanc ever be made habitable? Our answer\r\n    would be, it will be many thousands of years before we have\r\n    reached the bottom of Mont Blanc in making the earth healthy.\r\n    Wait till we have reached the bottom before we discuss the top.”\r\n\r\nDid she with her large outlook and big heart see our absurdity as\r\nwell as our shame when, pointing a finger of scorn at what we named\r\nthe superstition of other countries, we were yet content to see Spain\r\nand France and Italy sending out daily, in religious service to the\r\npoor, whole regiments of gentle and refined women trained in the arts\r\nof healing and the methods of discipline, while even in our public\r\ninstitutions—our hospitals and workhouses and prisons—it would hardly\r\nhave been an exaggeration to say that most of the so-called “nurses” of\r\nthose days were but drunken sluts?\r\n\r\nShe herself has said:—\r\n\r\n    “Shall the Roman Catholic Church do all the work? Has not the\r\n    Protestant the same Lord, who accepted the services not only of\r\n    men, but also of women?”\r\n\r\nOne saving clause there is for England concerning this matter in the\r\nhistory of that time, in the work of a distinguished member of the\r\nSociety of Friends, even before Florence Nightingale or Felicia Skene\r\nhad been much heard of. We read that “the heavenly personality of\r\nElizabeth Fry (whom Miss Nightingale sought out and visited) was an\r\never-present inspiration in her life.” From Elizabeth Fry our heroine\r\nheard of Pastor Fliedner’s training institute for nurses at Kaiserswerth,\r\nalready described in the foregoing chapter; but, before going there,\r\nshe took in the meantime a self-imposed course of training in Britain,\r\nvisiting the hospitals in London, Edinburgh, and Dublin, though, so far\r\nas the nursing was concerned, the criticisms in her own _Nursing Notes_\r\nof later years would certainly suggest that what she learned was chiefly\r\nwhat _not_ to do. Her gracious and winning dignity was far indeed from\r\nthe blindness of a weak amiability, and it can hardly be doubted that\r\nwhat she saw of the so-called “nurses” in our hospitals of those days,\r\nwent far to deepen her resolve to devote herself to a calling then in\r\ndire neglect and disrepute. Dirt, disorder, drunkenness—these are the\r\nwords used by a trustworthy biographer in describing the ways of English\r\nnurses in those days—of whom, indeed, we are told that they were of a\r\nvery coarse order—ill-trained, hard-hearted, immoral. There must surely\r\nhave been exceptions, but they seem to have been so rare as to have\r\nescaped notice. Indeed, it was even said that in those days—so strong\r\nand stupefying is the force of custom—decent girls avoided this noble\r\ncalling, fearing to lose their character if found in its ranks.\r\n\r\nBut whatever were Florence Nightingale’s faults—and she was by no means\r\nso inhuman as to be without faults—conventionality of thought and action\r\ncertainly cannot be counted among them; and what she saw of the poor\r\ndegraded souls who waited on the sick in our hospitals did but strengthen\r\nher resolve to become a nurse herself.\r\n\r\nSince she found no good school of nursing in England, she went abroad,\r\nand visited, among other places, the peaceful old hospital of St. John\r\nat Bruges, where the nuns are cultivated and devoted women who are well\r\nskilled in the gentle art of nursing.\r\n\r\nTo city after city she went, taking with her not only her gift of\r\ndiscernment, but also that open mind and earnest heart which made of her\r\nlife-offering so world-wide a boon.\r\n\r\nI do not think I have used too strong a word of the gift she was\r\npreparing. For the writer of an article which appeared in _Nursing\r\nNotes_[5] was right when, at the end of Miss Nightingale’s life, she\r\nwrote of her:—\r\n\r\n    “Miss Nightingale belongs to that band of the great ones of\r\n    the earth who may be acclaimed as citizens of the world; her\r\n    influence has extended far beyond the limits of the nation to\r\n    which she owed her birth, and in a very special sense she will\r\n    be the great prototype for all time to those who follow more\r\n    especially in her footsteps, in the profession she practically\r\n    created. We must ever be grateful for the shining example she\r\n    has given to nurses, who in her find united that broad-minded\r\n    comprehension of the ultimate aim of all their work, with a\r\n    patient and untiring devotion to its practical detail, which\r\n    alone combine to make the perfect nurse.”\r\n\r\nBut as yet she was only humbly and diligently preparing herself for the\r\nvocation to which she had determined, in face of countless obstacles, to\r\ndevote herself, little knowing how vast would be the opportunities given\r\nto her when once she was ready for the work.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring of 1849-50 she made a long tour through\r\nEgypt with Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge. On her way there she met in Paris\r\ntwo Sisters of the Order of St. Vincent de Paul, from whom she took\r\nintroductions to the schools and “miséricorde” in Alexandria. There she\r\nsaw the fruits of long and self-denying discipline among the Nursing\r\nSisters, and in the following year she visited Pastor Fliedner’s\r\nInstitute at Kaiserswerth, where, among Protestant deaconesses, the life\r\nof ordered simplicity and service showed some of the same virtues.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale’s first visit to Kaiserswerth was comparatively short,\r\nbut in the following year, 1852, she went there again and took four\r\nmonths of definite training, from June to October.\r\n\r\nA deep and warm regard seems to have arisen between the Fliedners and\r\ntheir English pupil, and the pastor’s friendship for Miss Nightingale’s\r\nrevered counsellor, Elizabeth Fry, must have been one pleasant link in\r\nthe happy bond.\r\n\r\nFliedner was certainly a wonderful man, and Miss Nightingale’s comment on\r\nthe spirit of his work was as true as it was witty. “Pastor Fliedner,”\r\nshe said, “began his work with two beds under a roof, not with a castle\r\nin the air, and Kaiserswerth is now diffusing its blessings and its\r\ndeaconesses over almost every Protestant land.” This was literally true.\r\nWithin ten years of founding Kaiserswerth he had established sixty\r\nnurses in twenty-five different centres. Later he founded a Mother-house\r\non Mount Zion at Jerusalem, having already settled some of his nurses\r\nat Pittsburg in the United States. The building for the Jerusalem\r\nMother-house was given by the King of Prussia, and, nursing all sick\r\npeople, without any question of creed, is a school of training for nurses\r\nin the East.\r\n\r\nAlexandria, Beyrout, Smyrna, Bucharest—he visited them all, and it is due\r\nto his efforts nearer home that to-day in almost all German towns of any\r\nimportance there is a Deaconess Home, sending out trained women to nurse\r\nin middle-class families at very moderate fees, and ready to nurse the\r\npoor without any charge at all.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1864, “he passed to his glorious rest”—the words are Miss\r\nNightingale’s—there were already one hundred such houses, and during part\r\nof Miss Nightingale’s visit to Kaiserswerth, Pastor Fliedner was away a\r\ngood deal on the missionary journeys which spread the Deaconess Homes\r\nthrough Germany, but they met quite often enough for each to appreciate\r\nthe noble character of the other. In all his different kinds of work for\r\nhelping the poor she was eagerly interested, and it may be that some of\r\nher wise criticisms of district visiting in later years may have been\r\nsuggested by the courtesy and good manners that ruled the visiting of\r\npoor homes at Kaiserswerth in which she shared. It was there also that\r\nshe made warm friendship with Henrietta Frickenhaus, in whose training\r\ncollege at Kaiserswerth 400 pupils had already passed muster. It should\r\nbe added that Henrietta Frickenhaus was the first schoolmistress of\r\nKaiserswerth.\r\n\r\nMr. Sidney Herbert visited Kaiserswerth while Miss Nightingale was there,\r\nand when, in the great moment that came afterwards, he asked her to go\r\nout to the Crimea, he knew well how detailed and definite her training\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nPastor Fliedner’s eldest daughter told Mrs. Tooley how vividly she\r\nrecalled her father’s solemn farewell blessing when Miss Nightingale was\r\nleaving Kaiserswerth; laying his hands on her bent head and, with eyes\r\nthat seemed to look beyond the scene that lay before him, praying that\r\nshe might be stablished in the Truth till death, and receive the Crown of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nAnd even mortal eyes may read a little of how those prayers for her\r\nfuture were fulfilled.\r\n\r\nShe left vivid memories. “No one has ever passed so brilliant an\r\nexamination,” said Fliedner, “or shown herself so thoroughly mistress of\r\nall she had to learn, as the young, wealthy, and graceful Englishwoman.”\r\nAgnes Jones, who was trained there before her work in Liverpool left a\r\nmemorable record of life spent in self-denying service, tells how the\r\nworkers at Kaiserswerth longed to see Miss Nightingale again, how her\r\nwomanliness and lovableness were remembered, and how among the sick\r\npeople were those who even in dying blessed her for having led them to\r\nthe Redeemer; for throughout her whole life her religion was the very\r\nlife of her life, as deep as it was quiet, the underlying secret of\r\nthat compassionate self-detachment and subdued fire, without which her\r\nwit and shrewdness would have lost their absolving glow and underlying\r\ntenderness. Hers was ever the gentleness of strength, not the easy\r\nbending of the weak. She was a pioneer among women, and did much to break\r\ndown the cruel limitations which, in the name of affection and tradition,\r\nhemmed in the lives of English girls in those days. Perhaps she was among\r\nthe first of that day in England to realize that the Christ, her Master,\r\nwho sent Mary as His first messenger of the Resurrection, was in a fine\r\nsense of the word “unconventional,” even though He came that every jot\r\nand tittle of religious law might be _spiritually_ fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt was after her return to England from Germany that she published her\r\nlittle pamphlet on Kaiserswerth, from which quotations have already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nHer next visit was to the Convent of St. Vincent de Paul in Paris,\r\nwhere the nursing was a part of the long-established routine, and while\r\nthere she was able to visit the hospitals in Paris, and learned much\r\nfrom the Sisters in their organized work among the houses of the poor.\r\nIn the midst of all this she was herself taken ill, and was nursed\r\nby the Sisters. Her direct and personal experience of their tender\r\nskill no doubt left its mark upon her own fitness. On her return home\r\nto complete her recovery, her new capacity and knowledge made a good\r\ndeal of delighted talk in the cottages, and Mrs. Tooley tells us how\r\nit was rumoured that “Miss Florence could set a broken leg better than\r\na doctor,” and made the old rheumatic folk feel young again with her\r\nremedies, to say nothing of her “eye lotions,” which “was enough to ruin\r\nthe spectacle folk.” She was always ahead of her time in her belief in\r\nsimple rules of health and diet and hatred of all that continual use\r\nof drugs which was then so much in fashion, and she no doubt saw many\r\ninteresting experiments at Matlock Bank in helping Nature to do her own\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale in 1854.\r\n\r\n(_From a drawing by H. M. B. C._)]\r\n\r\nAs soon as her convalescence was over she visited London hospitals, and\r\nin the autumn of 1852 those of Edinburgh and Dublin, having spent a part\r\nof the interval in her home at Embley, where she had again the pleasure\r\nof being near her friends the Herberts, with whose neighbourly work among\r\nthe poor she was in fullest sympathy.\r\n\r\nHer first post was at the Harley Street Home for Sick Governesses. She\r\nhad been interested in many kinds of efforts on behalf of those who\r\nsuffer; Lord Shaftesbury’s Ragged School labours, for instance, had\r\nappealed to her, and to that and other like enterprises she had given\r\nthe money earned by her little book on Kaiserswerth. But she always had\r\nin view the one clear and definite aim—to fit herself in every possible\r\nway for competent nursing. It was on August 12, 1853, that she became\r\nSuperintendent of the Harley Street institution, which is now known\r\nas the Florence Nightingale Hospital. It was founded in 1850 by Lady\r\nCanning, as a Home for Invalid Gentlewomen, and when an appeal was made\r\nto Miss Nightingale for money and good counsel, she gave in addition\r\n_herself_ and became for a time the Lady Superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe hospital was intended mainly for sick governesses, for whom the need\r\nof such a home of rest and care and surgical help had sometimes arisen,\r\nbut it had been mismanaged and was in danger of becoming a failure. There\r\nMiss Nightingale, we read, was to be found “in the midst of various\r\nduties of a hospital—for the Home was largely a sanatorium—organizing the\r\nnurses, attending to the correspondence, prescriptions, and accounts; in\r\nshort, performing all the duties of a hard-working matron, as well as\r\nlargely financing the institution.”\r\n\r\n    “The task of dealing with sick and querulous women,” says\r\n    Mrs. Tooley, “embittered and rendered sensitive and exacting\r\n    by the unfortunate circumstances of their lives, was not an\r\n    easy one, but Miss Nightingale had a calm and cheerful spirit\r\n    which could bear with the infirmities of the weak. And so she\r\n    laboured on in the dull house in Harley Street, summer and\r\n    winter, bringing order and comfort out of a wretched chaos, and\r\n    proving a real friend and helper to the sick and sorrow-laden\r\n    women.\r\n\r\n    “At length the strain proved too much for her delicate body,\r\n    and she was compelled most reluctantly to resign her task.”\r\n\r\nShe had worked very hard, and was seldom seen outside the walls of the\r\nhouse in Harley Street. Though she was not there very long, the effect\r\nof her presence was great and lasting, and the Home, which has now moved\r\nto Lisson Grove, has increased steadily in usefulness, though it has\r\nof necessity changed its lines a little, because the High Schools and\r\nthe higher education of women have opened new careers and lessened the\r\nnumber of governesses, especially helpless governesses. It gives aid far\r\nand wide to the daughters and other kindred of hard-worked professional\r\nmen, men who are serving the world with their brains, and nobly seeking\r\nto give work and service of as good a kind as lies within their power,\r\nrather than to snatch at its exact value in coin, even if that were\r\npossible—and in such toil as theirs, whether they be teachers, artists,\r\nparsons, or themselves doctors, it is _not_ possible; for such work\r\ncannot be weighed in money.\r\n\r\nQueen Alexandra is President, and last year 301 patients were treated,\r\nbesides the 16 who were already within its walls when the new year began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    _The beginning of the war—A sketch of Sidney Herbert._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was on April 11, 1854, that war was declared by Russia, and four days\r\nlater the invasion of the Ottoman Empire began. England and France were\r\nthe sworn allies of Turkey, and though the war had begun with a quarrel\r\nabout “a key and a trinket,” the key and the trinket were, after all,\r\nsymbols, just as truly as the flags for which men lay down their lives.\r\n\r\nEngland had entrusted the cause of peace to those faithful lovers of\r\npeace, Lord Aberdeen, Mr. Gladstone, Mr. Cobden, and Mr. Bright; but no\r\nsingle man in our “constitutional” Government is in reality a free agent,\r\nand the peace-loving members of the Cabinet had been skilfully handled\r\nby the potent Lord Palmerston, and did not perceive soon enough that the\r\nunderstanding with Turkey and with France, into which they had drifted,\r\nmust endanger the peace of Europe because the other Powers were ignored.\r\nIf the English people had been secretly longing for war—and it is said\r\nthat they had—then the terrible cup they had desired was to be drunk to\r\nthe lees: the war on which they were entering was a war of agony and\r\nshame, a war in which men died by hundreds of neglect and mismanagement,\r\nbefore a woman’s hand could reach the helm and reform the hospital\r\nordinances in the ship of State.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, before we plunge into the horrors of the Crimean War we may\r\nrest our minds with a few pages about Miss Nightingale’s friend, Mr.\r\nSidney Herbert, who became an active and self-sacrificing power in the\r\nWar Office.\r\n\r\nWhen Florence Nightingale was born, Sidney Herbert—afterwards Lord\r\nHerbert of Lea—was already a boy of ten.\r\n\r\nThose who know the outlook over the Thames, from the windows of Pembroke\r\nLodge at Richmond, will realize that he too, like Florence Nightingale,\r\nwas born in a very beautiful spot. His father, the eleventh Earl of\r\nPembroke, had married the daughter of Count Woronzow, the Russian\r\nAmbassador, and, in Sidney’s knowledgeable help afterwards at the War\r\nOffice during the Crimean War, it is not without interest to remember\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nHis birth had not been expected so soon, and there were no baby clothes\r\nhandy at Pembroke Lodge, where his mother was staying. It would seem\r\nthat shops were not so well able to supply every need with a ready-made\r\ngarment as they are in these days; so the first clothes that the baby boy\r\nwore were lent by the workhouse until his own were ready.\r\n\r\nIn later days, when he cared for the needs of all who crossed his path,\r\nuntil his people feared—or pretended to fear—that he would give away all\r\nhe had, his mother used to say that workhouse clothes were the first he\r\nhad worn after his birth, and were also clearly those in which he would\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nHe had good reason to rejoice in his lineage, for he was descended from\r\nthe sister of Sir Philip Sidney, after whom he was named. He too, like\r\nhis great namesake, was all his life full of that high courtesy which\r\ncomes of loving consideration for others rather than for self, and is\r\nnever more charming than in those who, being in every sense “well-born,”\r\nhave seen it in their fathers, and in their fathers before them,\r\nnotwithstanding that in those others who, less fortunate, whether they be\r\nrich or poor, having come of an ill brood, are yet themselves well-bred,\r\nsuch courtesy is of the courts of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s father had much individuality. Being the owner of some thirty\r\nvillages, and lord-lieutenant of the county, he was naturally a great\r\nmagnate in Wiltshire. He was very fond of dogs, and his favourites among\r\nthem sat at his own table, each with its own chair and plate.\r\n\r\nSidney was almost like an only son at home, for his elder brother,\r\nwho was, of course, the heir to Lord Herbert’s patrimony, had married\r\nunhappily and lived abroad.\r\n\r\nThe little boy seems to have been really rather like the little angels\r\nin Italian pictures, a child with golden curls and big brown eyes, with\r\nthe look of love and sunshine gleaming out of them that he kept all his\r\nlife, and there is a letter of his mother’s, describing a children’s\r\nfancy dress ball, at which she dressed him up as a little cupid, with\r\nwings and a wreath of roses, and was very proud of the result. He was\r\neither too little to mind, or if he hated it, as so many boys would,\r\nhe bore with it to please his mother, who, we are told, made as much\r\nof an idol of him as did the rest of his family. And indeed it is most\r\nwonderful, from all accounts, that he was not completely spoiled. Here is\r\nhis mother’s letter about it:—\r\n\r\n    “I never did see anything half so like an angel. I must say\r\n    so, although it was my own performance. He had on a garland of\r\n    roses and green leaves mixed; a pair of wild duck’s wings, put\r\n    on wire to make them set well; a bow and arrow, and a quiver\r\n    with arrows in it, tied on with a broad blue ribbon that went\r\n    across his sweet neck.”\r\n\r\nIn another of her letters we are told of a visit paid, about this time,\r\nto Queen Charlotte, and how the child “Boysey” climbed into the Queen’s\r\nlap, drew up and pulled down window-blinds, romped at hide-and-seek with\r\nthe Duke of Cambridge, and showed himself to be not in the slightest\r\ndegree abashed by the presence of royalty.\r\n\r\nLord Fitzwilliam, a friend and distant relation, used often to stay at\r\nPembroke Lodge and at Wilton, and seems to have been pleased by the boy’s\r\ncourteous ways and winning looks; for, having no children of his own,\r\nwhen he left most of his property to Lord Pembroke, the “remainder,”\r\nwhich meant big estates in Ireland and Shropshire, was to go to his\r\nsecond son, Sidney.\r\n\r\nThe boy loved his father with a very special intimacy and tenderness, as\r\nwe see by a letter written soon after he left Harrow and a little while\r\nbefore he went up to Oxford, where at Oriel he at once made friends with\r\nmen of fine character and sterling worth. His father had died in 1827,\r\nand he writes from Chilmark, where the rector, Mr. Lear, was his tutor,\r\nand the Rectory was near his own old home at Wilton:—\r\n\r\n    “You cannot think how comfortable it is to be in a nice little\r\n    country church after that great noisy chapel. Everything is\r\n    so quiet and the people all so attentive that you might hear\r\n    a pin fall while Mr. Lear is preaching. I like, too, being so\r\n    near Wilton, so many things here ever bringing to mind all _he_\r\n    said and did, all places where I have ridden with _him_, and\r\n    the home where we used to be so happy. In short, there is not\r\n    a spot about Wilton now which I do not love as if it were a\r\n    person. I hope you will be coming there soon and get it over,\r\n    for seeing that place again will be a dreadful trial to you.”\r\n\r\nAmong his friends at Oxford were Cardinal Manning, Lord Lincoln, who\r\nas Duke of Newcastle was afterwards closely associated with him at the\r\nWar Office; Lord Elgin, Lord Dalhousie, and Lord Canning, all three\r\nViceroys of India. It was there, too, that his friendship with Mr.\r\nGladstone began. Lord Stanmore says that Mr. Gladstone told him a year\r\nor two before his death how one day at a University Convocation dealing\r\nwith a petition against the Roman Catholic Relief Bill, to which he\r\nhad himself gone as an undergraduate outsider, he had noticed among the\r\ncrowd of undergraduates in the vestibule of the Convocation House “a tall\r\nand graceful figure, surmounted by a face of such singular sweetness\r\nand refinement that his attention was at once riveted by it, and with\r\nsuch force that the picture he then saw rose again as vividly before him\r\nwhile talking as when first seen sixty-eight years before.” Mr. Gladstone\r\ninquired the name of this attractive freshman. “Herbert of Oriel,” was\r\nthe answer. They became friends; but in those days friendships between\r\nmen of different colleges and different ages were not always easily kept\r\nup. The more intimate relations between himself and Herbert date only\r\nfrom a later time.\r\n\r\nHerbert’s noble and beautiful life was to be closely intertwined with\r\nthat of his little friend and neighbour, in one of those friendships—holy\r\nin their unselfish ardour of comradeship and service of others—which put\r\nto shame many of the foolish sayings of the world, and prove that, while\r\nan ideal marriage is the divinest happiness God gives to earthly life, an\r\nideal friendship also has the power to lift both joy and pain into the\r\nregion of heaven itself.\r\n\r\nThis was a friendship which, as we shall see, arose in the first\r\ninstance partly out of the fact that the two children grew up on\r\nneighbouring estates, and were both what Mrs. Tollemache has called\r\n“Sunday people”—people with leisure to give to others, as well as wealth;\r\nand at the end of Sidney Herbert’s life it was said that the following\r\ndescription of Sir Philip Sidney, after whom he was named, was in every\r\nparticular a description of him:—\r\n\r\n    “He was gentle, loving, compassionate, forgiving as a woman,\r\n    and yet had the dignity and valour of a man. His liberality was\r\n    so great that with him not to give was not to enjoy what he had.\r\n\r\n    “In his familiarity with men he never descended, but raised\r\n    everybody to his own level. So modest, so humble was he, and so\r\n    inaccessible to flattery, that he esteemed not praise except as\r\n    an encouragement to further exertion in well-doing. His tongue\r\n    knew no deceit, and his mind no policy but frankness, courage,\r\n    and sincerity, and ... England has had greater statesmen, but\r\n    never so choice a union of the qualities which make a Sidney.\r\n    His fame is founded on those personal qualities of which his\r\n    contemporaries were the best judges, although they may not\r\n    leave a trace in books or in history.”\r\n\r\nAnd of both might it most emphatically have been said, as was said by Mr.\r\nGladstone of one of them: “Rare indeed—God only knows how rare—are men\r\nwith his qualities; but even a man with his qualities might not have been\r\nso happy as to possess his opportunities. He had them, and he used them.”\r\n\r\nThe story of his betraying a State secret to that other friend, who was\r\nthe original of “Diana of the Crossways,” is a myth which has been more\r\nthan once disproved, and of which his biographer says that any one who\r\nknew him, or knew the real “Diana,” would have treated it with derision.\r\n\r\nBut he was always ready to bear lightly undeserved blame, just as he took\r\nit as of no account when credit that should have been his was rendered\r\nelsewhere. Take, for instance, the warrant which relieved soldiers of\r\ngood conduct from the liability of punishment by flogging. He had worked\r\nhard at this warrant, and it originated with him, although the Duke of\r\nCambridge supported him in it. But when one of his friends expressed\r\nannoyance that the praise had come to the better-known man, he replied\r\nimpatiently: “What _does_ it matter who gets the credit so long as the\r\nthing itself is done?”\r\n\r\nNor did he ever seem to care about mere material reward, and he simply\r\ncould not understand the outcry of one useful servant of the State who,\r\nwhen likely to be left out of office in prospective Cabinet arrangements,\r\nexclaimed, “And pray what is to become of _me_?”\r\n\r\nWith him, as with Miss Nightingale, giving was an untold and constant\r\njoy, and he was able to be lavish because of his great personal economy\r\nand self-denial. In all his beautiful home at Wilton, Lord Stanmore tells\r\nus, his own were the only rooms that could have been called bare or\r\nshabby, and when he was urged to buy a good hunter for himself, he had\r\nspent too much on others to allow himself such a luxury. He delighted in\r\neducating the sons of widows left by men of his own order without means.\r\n“He maintained,” we read, “at one and the same time boys at Harrow,\r\nMarlborough, and Woolwich, another in training for an Australian career,\r\nand a fifth who was being educated for missionary work. And he expended\r\nmuch in sending poor clergymen and their families to the seaside for a\r\nmonth’s holiday.” And to gentlepeople who were poor we read that the help\r\nof money “was given so delicately as to remove the burden of obligation.\r\nA thousand little attentions in time of sickness or sorrow helped and\r\ncheered them. In all these works his wife was his active coadjutor,\r\nbut” we read that “it was not till after his death that she was at all\r\naware of their extent, and even then not fully, so unostentatiously and\r\nsecretly were they performed. His sunny presence,” says his biographer,\r\n“warmed and cheered all around him, and the charm of his conversation\r\nmade him the light and centre of any company of which he formed a\r\npart.[6] There are, however, many men who are brilliant and joyous in\r\nsociety, over whom a strange change comes when they cross their own\r\nthreshold. Sidney Herbert was never more brilliant, never more charming,\r\nnever more witty than when alone with his mother, his wife, his sisters,\r\nor his children.\r\n\r\n“Nowhere was he seen to greater advantage than in his own home. He\r\ndelighted in country life, and took a keen and almost boyish interest in\r\nits sports and pursuits, into the enjoyment of which he threw himself\r\nwith a zest and fulness not common among busy men ... a good shot, a bold\r\nrider, and an expert fisherman, he was welcomed by the country gentlemen\r\nas one of themselves, and to this he owed much of his great popularity in\r\nhis own country. But it was also due to the unfailing consideration shown\r\nby him to those of every class around him, and the sure trust in his\r\nresponsive sympathy which was felt by all, high and low alike, dwelling\r\nwithin many miles of Wilton. By all dependent on him, or in any way under\r\nhis orders, he was adored, and well deserved to be so. The older servants\r\nwere virtually members of his family, and he took much pains in seeing\r\nto their interests, and helping their children to start well in the\r\nworld.”\r\n\r\n“Never,” says Lady Herbert, “did he come down to Wilton, if only for a\r\nfew days, without going to see Sally Parham, an old housemaid, who had\r\nbeen sixty years in the family, and Larkum, an old carpenter of whom he\r\nwas very fond, and who on his death-bed gave him the most beautiful and\r\nemphatic blessing I ever heard.”\r\n\r\nOf his splendid work in the War Office, and for our soldiers long after\r\nhe had laid aside War Office cares, we shall read in its due place.\r\nMeanwhile we think of him for the present as Florence Nightingale’s\r\nfriend, and her neighbour when in the south, for his beautiful Wilton\r\nhome was quite near to her own home at Embley.\r\n\r\nBefore the Crimean War began he was already giving his mind to army\r\nreform, and while that war was in progress the horrors of insanitary\r\ncarelessness, as he saw them through Florence Nightingale’s letters, made\r\nof him England’s greatest sanitary reformer in army matters, with the\r\nsingle exception of Florence Nightingale herself.\r\n\r\nThe two had from the first many tastes in common, and among those of\r\nminor importance was their great affection for animals. He was as devoted\r\nto his horse Andover as she had been to the little owl Athene, of which\r\nher sister, Lady Verney, in an old MS. quoted by Sir Stuart Grant Duff,\r\ngives the following pretty history:—\r\n\r\n    “Bought for 6 lepta from some children into whose hands it had\r\n    dropped out of its nest in the Parthenon, it was brought by\r\n    Miss Nightingale to Trieste, with a slip of a plane from the\r\n    Ilissus and a cicala. At Vienna the owl ate the cicala and was\r\n    mesmerized, much to the improvement of his temper. At Prague\r\n    a waiter was heard to say that ‘this is the bird which all\r\n    English ladies carry with them, because it tells them when they\r\n    are to die.’ It came to England by Berlin, lived at Embley,\r\n    Lea Hurst, and in London, travelled in Germany, and stayed at\r\n    Carlsbad while its mistress was at Kaiserswerth. It died the\r\n    very day she was to have started for Scutari (her departure was\r\n    delayed two days), and the only tear that she had shed during\r\n    that tremendous week was when ⸺ put the little body into her\r\n    hand. ‘Poor little beastie,’ she said, ‘it was odd how much I\r\n    loved you.’”\r\n\r\nAnd we read that before his death, Lord Herbert with a like tenderness\r\nbade a special farewell to his horse Andover, kissing him on the neck,\r\nfeeding him with sugar, and telling him he should never ride again.\r\n\r\nThat was when he was already extremely ill, though not too ill to take\r\ncare that a young priest who was dying also, but too poor to buy all the\r\ndoctor had ordered, should be cared for out of his own purse.\r\n\r\nWith him, as with Florence Nightingale, giving and helping seem to have\r\nbeen unceasing.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between them was very dear to both of them, and was warmly\r\nshared by Lord Herbert’s wife. When they all knew that death was waiting\r\nwith a summons, and that Lord Herbert’s last journey abroad could have\r\nbut one ending, even though, as things turned out, he was to have just\r\na momentary glimpse of home again, Florence Nightingale was the last\r\nfriend to whom he bade farewell. But that was not till 1861, and in the\r\nintervening years they worked incessantly together, for the good of the\r\narmy and the improvement of sanitary conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    _The Crimean muddle—Explanations and excuses._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last chapter we ended with a word about those sanitary reforms\r\nwhich were yet to come. How appalling was the ignorance and confusion in\r\n1854, when the war in the Crimea began, has now become matter of common\r\nknowledge everywhere.\r\n\r\nI note later, as a result of my talk with General Evatt, some of the\r\nreasons and excuses for the dire neglect and muddle that reigned. John\r\nBull was, as usual, so arrogantly sure of himself that he had—also as\r\nusual—taken no sort of care to keep himself fit in time of peace, and\r\nthere was no central organizing authority for the equipment of the\r\narmy—every one was responsible, and therefore no one. The provisions\r\nbought by contract were many of them rotten and mouldy, so cleverly had\r\nthe purchasers been deceived and defrauded. The clothing provided for\r\nthe men before Sebastopol, where, in at least one instance, man was\r\nliterally frozen to man, were such as would have been better suited to\r\nIndia or South Africa. Many of the boots sent out were fitter for women\r\nand children playing on green lawns than for the men who must tramp over\r\nrough and icy roads. The very horses were left to starve for want of\r\nproper hay. Proper medical provision there was none. There were doctors,\r\nsome of them nobly unselfish, but few of them trained for that particular\r\nwork. An army surgeon gets little practice in time of peace, and one\r\nlady, a Red Cross nurse, told me that even in our South African campaign\r\nthe doctor with whom she did her first bit of bandaging out there told\r\nher he had not bandaged an arm for fifteen years! But indeed many of the\r\ndoctors in the Crimea were not only badly prepared, they were also so\r\ntied up with red-tape details that, though they gave their lives freely,\r\nthey quickly fell in with the helpless chaos of a hospital without a head.\r\n\r\nEngland shuddered to the heart when at last she woke up under the lash\r\nof the following letter from William Howard Russell, the _Times_ war\r\ncorrespondent:—\r\n\r\n    “The commonest accessories of a hospital are wanting, there is\r\n    not the least attention paid to decency or cleanliness, the\r\n    stench is appalling ... and, for all I can observe, the men die\r\n    without the least effort to save them. There they lie just as\r\n    they were let gently down on the ground by the poor fellows,\r\n    the comrades, who brought them on their backs from the camp\r\n    with the greatest tenderness, but who are not allowed to remain\r\n    with them.”\r\n\r\n    “Are there,” he wrote at a later date, “no devoted women among\r\n    us, able and willing to go forth and minister to the sick and\r\n    suffering soldiers of the East in the hospitals at Scutari?\r\n    Are none of the daughters of England, at this extreme hour of\r\n    need, ready for such a work of mercy?... France has sent forth\r\n    her Sisters of Mercy unsparingly, and they are even now by the\r\n    bedsides of the wounded and the dying, giving what woman’s hand\r\n    alone can give of comfort and relief.... Must we fall so far\r\n    below the French in self-sacrifice and devotedness, in a work\r\n    which Christ so signally blesses as done unto Himself? ‘I was\r\n    sick and ye visited me.’”\r\n\r\nWhat the art of nursing had fallen to in England may be guessed from the\r\nfact lately mentioned to me by a great friend of Miss Nightingale’s, that\r\nwhen Florence Nightingale told her family she would like to devote her\r\nlife to nursing, they said with a smile, “Are you sure you would not like\r\nto be a kitchen-maid?”\r\n\r\nYet the Nightingales were, on other questions, such as that of the\r\neducation of girls, far in advance of their time.\r\n\r\nPossibly nothing short of those letters to the _Times_, touching, as they\r\ndid, the very quick of the national pride, could have broken down the\r\n“Chinese wall” of that particular prejudice.\r\n\r\nSomething may be said at this point as to what had been at the\r\nroot of the dreadful condition of things in the hospitals before\r\nMiss Nightingale’s arrival. I have had some instructive talk with\r\nSurgeon-General Evatt, who knows the medical administration of our army\r\nthrough and through, and whose friendship with Miss Nightingale arose in\r\na very interesting way, but will be mentioned later on in its due place.\r\n\r\nGeneral Evatt has pointed out to me in conversation that what is still\r\na weakness of our great London hospitals, though lessened there by the\r\nfierce light of public opinion that is ever beating upon them, was the\r\nvery source of the evil at Scutari.\r\n\r\nSuch hospitals as the London, doing such magnificent work that it\r\ndeserves a thousand times the support it receives, are, explained General\r\nEvatt, without any central authority. The doctors pay their daily visits\r\nand their code is a high one, but they are as varied in ability and in\r\ncharacter as any other group of doctors, and are responsible to no one\r\nbut God and their own conscience. The nursing staff have _their_ duties\r\nand _their_ code, but are under separate management. The committee\r\nsecures the funds and manages the finance, but it is again quite distinct\r\nin its powers, and does not control either doctors or nurses.\r\n\r\nThe Barrack Hospital at Scutari was, said the General, in this respect\r\njust like a London hospital of sixty years ago, set down in the midst of\r\nthe Crimea. There was, he said—to adapt a well-known quotation—“knowledge\r\nwithout authority, and authority without knowledge,” but no power to\r\nunite them in responsible effort. Therefore we must feel deep pity,\r\nnot indignation, with regard to any one member of the staff; for each\r\nalone was helpless against the chaos, until Miss Nightingale, who stood\r\noutside the official muddle, yet with the friendship of a great War\r\nMinister behind her, and in her hand all the powers of wealth, hereditary\r\ninfluence, and personal charm, quietly cut some of the knots of red tape\r\nwhich were, as she saw clearly, strangling the very lives of our wounded\r\nsoldiers. When I spoke of the miracle by which a woman who had been\r\nall her life fitting herself for this work, had suddenly received her\r\nworld-wide opportunity, he replied: “Yes, I have often said it was as if\r\na very perfect machine had through long years been fitted together and\r\npolished to the highest efficiency, and when, at last, it was ready for\r\nservice, a hand was put forth to accept and use it.”\r\n\r\nJust as he sought to explain the awful condition of the army hospitals\r\nat the beginning of the war; so also he, as a military doctor, pointed\r\nout to me that there were even many excuses for the condition of the\r\ntransport service, and the idiotic blunders of a government that sent\r\nsoldiers to the freezing winters of the Crimea in clothes that would have\r\nbeen better suited to the hot climate of India.\r\n\r\nThe army after the Peninsular War had been split up into battalions, and\r\nhad, like the hospitals, lost all _centre_ of authority. England had\r\nbeen seething with the social troubles of our transition from the feudal\r\norder to the new competitions and miseries of a commercial and mechanical\r\nage. Machinery was causing uproar among the hand-workers. Chartist\r\nriots, bread riots, were upsetting the customary peace. Troops were sent\r\nhither and thither, scattered over the country, and allowed a certain\r\ndegree of licence and slackness. The army had no administrative head.\r\nThere was no one to consider the question of stores or transit, and,\r\neven when the war broke out, it was treated with John Bull’s too casual\r\nself-satisfaction as a moment of excitement and self-glorification, from\r\nwhich our troops were to return as victors in October, after displaying\r\nthemselves for a few weeks and satisfactorily alarming the enemy. The\r\nmoral of it all is ever present and needs no pressing home. Not until\r\nevery man has had the training of a man in defence of his own home, and\r\nis himself responsible for the defence of his own hearth, shall we as a\r\nnation learn the humility and caution of the true courage, and realize\r\nhow much, at the best, is outside human control, and how great is our\r\nresponsibility in every detail for all that lies within it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    “_Five were wise, and five foolish._”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the great moment came, there was one wise virgin whose lamp had long\r\nbeen trimmed and daily refilled with ever finer quality of flame. She was\r\nnot alone. There were others, and she was always among the first to do\r\nthem honour. But she stood easily first, and first, too, in the modesty\r\nof all true greatness. All her life had been a training for the work\r\nwhich was now given to her hand.\r\n\r\nAmong the many women who longed to nurse and tend our soldiers, many were\r\nfast bound by duties to those dependent on them, many were tied hand\r\nand foot by the pettifogging prejudices of the school in which they had\r\nbeen brought up. Many, whose ardour would have burned up all prejudice\r\nand all secondary claim, were yet ignorant, weak, incapable. Florence\r\nNightingale, on the contrary, was highly trained, not only in intellect,\r\nbut in the details of what she rightly regarded as an art, “a craft,”\r\nthe careful art of nursing—highly disciplined in body and in soul, every\r\nmuscle and nerve obedient to her will, an international linguist, a woman\r\nin whom organizing power had been developed to its utmost capacity by a\r\nseverely masculine education, and whose experience had been deepened by\r\npractical service both at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nHer decision was a foregone conclusion, and a very striking seal was set\r\nupon it. For the letter, in which she offered to go out to the Crimea\r\nas the servant of her country, was crossed by a letter from Mr. Sidney\r\nHerbert, that country’s representative at the War Office, asking her to\r\ngo. Promptitude on both sides had its own reward; for each would have\r\nmissed the honour of spontaneous initiative had there been a day’s delay.\r\n\r\nHere is a part of Mr. Herbert’s letter:—\r\n\r\n                                               “_October 15, 1854._\r\n\r\n    “DEAR MISS NIGHTINGALE,—You will have seen in the papers\r\n    that there is a great deficiency of nurses at the hospital of\r\n    Scutari. The other alleged deficiencies, namely, of medical\r\n    men, lint, sheets, etc., must, if they ever existed, have\r\n    been remedied ere this, as the number of medical officers\r\n    with the army amounted to one to every ninety-five men in the\r\n    whole force, being nearly double what we have ever had before;\r\n    and thirty more surgeons went out there three weeks ago, and\r\n    must at this time, therefore, be at Constantinople. A further\r\n    supply went on Monday, and a fresh batch sail next week. As to\r\n    medical stores, they have been sent out in profusion, by the\r\n    ton weight—15,000 pair of sheets, medicine, wine, arrowroot in\r\n    the same proportion; and the only way of accounting for the\r\n    deficiency at Scutari, if it exists, is that the mass of the\r\n    stores went to Varna, and had not been sent back when the army\r\n    left for the Crimea, but four days would have remedied that.\r\n\r\n    “In the meantime, stores are arriving, but the deficiency of\r\n    female nurses is undoubted; none but male nurses have ever been\r\n    admitted to military hospitals. It would be impossible to\r\n    carry about a large staff of female nurses with an army in the\r\n    field. But at Scutari, having now a fixed hospital, no military\r\n    reason exists against the introduction; and I am confident they\r\n    might be introduced with great benefit, for hospital orderlies\r\n    must be very rough hands, and most of them, on such an occasion\r\n    as this, very inexperienced ones.\r\n\r\n    “I receive numbers of offers from ladies to go out, but they\r\n    are ladies who have no conception of what a hospital is, nor\r\n    of the nature of its duties; and they would, when the time\r\n    came, either recoil from the work or be entirely useless, and\r\n    consequently, what is worse, entirely in the way; nor would\r\n    these ladies probably even understand the necessity, especially\r\n    in a military hospital, of strict obedience to rule, etc....\r\n\r\n    “There is but one person in England that I know of who would\r\n    be capable of organizing and superintending such a scheme,\r\n    and I have been several times on the point of asking you\r\n    hypothetically if, supposing the attempt were made, you would\r\n    undertake to direct it. The selection of the rank and file\r\n    of nurses would be difficult—no one knows that better than\r\n    yourself. The difficulty of finding women equal to the task,\r\n    after all, full of horror, and requiring, besides knowledge and\r\n    goodwill, great knowledge and great courage, will be great; the\r\n    task of ruling them and introducing system among them great;\r\n    and not the least will be the difficulty of making the whole\r\n    work smoothly with the medical and military authorities out\r\n    there.\r\n\r\n    “This is what makes it so important that the experiment\r\n    should be carried out by one with administrative capacity and\r\n    experience. A number of sentimental, enthusiastic ladies turned\r\n    loose in the hospital at Scutari would probably after a few\r\n    days be _mises à la porte_ by those whose business they would\r\n    interrupt, and whose authority they would dispute.\r\n\r\n    “My question simply is—would you listen to the request to go\r\n    out and supervise the whole thing? You would, of course, have\r\n    plenary authority over all the nurses, and I think I could\r\n    secure you the fullest assistance and co-operation from the\r\n    medical staff, and you would also have an unlimited power of\r\n    drawing on the Government for whatever you think requisite\r\n    for the success of your mission. On this part of the subject\r\n    the details are too many for a letter, and I reserve it for\r\n    our meeting; for, whatever decision you take, I know you will\r\n    give me every assistance and advice. I do not say one word to\r\n    press you. You are the only person who can judge for yourself\r\n    which of conflicting or incompatible duties is the first or the\r\n    highest; but I think I must not conceal from you that upon your\r\n    decision will depend the ultimate success or failure of the\r\n    plan.... Will you let me have a line at the War Office, to let\r\n    me know?\r\n\r\n    “There is one point which I have hardly a right to touch\r\n    upon, but I trust you will pardon me. If you were inclined\r\n    to undertake the great work, would Mr. and Mrs. Nightingale\r\n    consent? This work would be so national, and the request made\r\n    to you, proceeding from the Government which represents the\r\n    nation, comes at such a moment that I do not despair of their\r\n    consent.\r\n\r\n    “Deriving your authority from the Government, your position\r\n    would ensure the respect and consideration of every one,\r\n    especially in a service where official rank carries so much\r\n    respect. This would secure you any attention or comfort on your\r\n    way out there, together with a complete submission to your\r\n    orders. I know these things are a matter of indifference to\r\n    you, except so far as they may further the great object you may\r\n    have in view; but they are of importance in themselves, and of\r\n    every importance to those who have a right to take an interest\r\n    in your personal position and comfort.\r\n\r\n    “I know you will come to a right and wise decision. God grant\r\n    it may be one in accordance with my hopes.—Believe me, dear\r\n    Miss Nightingale, ever yours,\r\n\r\n                                                  “SIDNEY HERBERT.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale’s decision was announced in the _Times_, and on October\r\n23 the following paragraph appeared in that paper:—\r\n\r\n    “It is known that Miss Nightingale has been appointed by\r\n    Government to the office of Superintendent of Nurses at\r\n    Scutari. She has been pressed to accept of sums of money for\r\n    the general objects of the hospitals for the sick and wounded.\r\n    Miss Nightingale neither invites nor can refuse these generous\r\n    offers. Her bankers’ account is opened at Messrs. Glyn’s, but\r\n    it must be understood that any funds forwarded to her can only\r\n    be used so as not to interfere with the official duties of the\r\n    Superintendent.”\r\n\r\nThis was written by Miss Nightingale herself, and the response in money\r\nwas at once very large, but money was by no means the first or most\r\ndifficult question.\r\n\r\nNo time must be lost in choosing the nurses who were to accompany the\r\nLady-in-Chief. It was not until later that she became known by that name,\r\nbut it already well described her office, for every vital arrangement and\r\ndecision seems to have centred in her. She knew well that her task could\r\nbe undertaken in no spirit of lightness, and she never wasted power in\r\nmere fuss or flurry.\r\n\r\nShe once wrote to Sir Bartle Frere of “that careless and ignorant\r\nperson called the Devil,” and she did not want any of his careless and\r\nignorant disciples to go out with her among her chosen band. Nor did she\r\nwant any incompetent sentimentalists of the kind brought before us in\r\nthat delightful story of our own South African War, of the soldier who\r\ngave thanks for the offer to wash his face, but confessed that fourteen\r\nother ladies had already offered the same service. Indeed, the rather\r\ngarish merriment of that little tale seems almost out of place when we\r\nrecall the rotting filth and unspeakable stench of blood and misery in\r\nwhich the men wounded in the Crimea were lying wrapped from head to\r\nfoot. No antiseptic surgery, no decent sanitation, no means of ordinary\r\ncleanliness, were as yet found for our poor Tommies, and Kinglake assures\r\nus that all the efforts of masculine organization, seeking to serve the\r\ncrowded hospitals with something called a laundry, had only succeeded in\r\nwashing _seven_ shirts for the entire army!\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale knew a little of the vastness of her undertaking,\r\nbut she is described by Lady Canning at this critical time as “gentle\r\nand wise and quiet”—“in no bustle or hurry.” Yet within a single week\r\nfrom the date of Mr. Herbert’s letter asking her to go out, all her\r\narrangements were made and her nurses chosen—nay more, the expedition had\r\nactually started.\r\n\r\nThe War Office issued its official intimation that “Miss Nightingale, a\r\nlady with greater practical experience of hospital administration and\r\ntreatment than any other lady in this country,” had undertaken the noble\r\nand arduous work of organizing and taking out nurses for the soldiers;\r\nand it was also notified that she had been appointed by Government to the\r\noffice of Superintendent of Nurses at Scutari.\r\n\r\nThe _Examiner_ published a little biographical sketch in reply to the\r\nquestion which was being asked everywhere. Society, of course, knew Miss\r\nNightingale very well, but Society includes only a small knot of people\r\nout of the crowd of London’s millions, to say nothing of the provinces.\r\nMany out of those millions were asking, “Who is Miss Nightingale?” and,\r\nin looking back, it is amazing to see how many disapproved of the step\r\nshe was taking.\r\n\r\nIn those days, as in these, and much more tyrannically than in these,\r\nMrs. Grundy had her silly daughters, ready to talk slander and folly\r\nabout any good woman who disregarded her. To Miss Nightingale she simply\r\ndid not exist. Miss Martineau was right when she wrote of her that “to\r\nher it was a small thing to be judged by man’s judgment.”\r\n\r\nAnd the spirit in which she chose the women who were to go out under her\r\nto the Crimea may be judged by later words of her own, called forth by a\r\ndiscussion of fees for nurses—words in which the italics are mine, though\r\nthe sentence is quoted here to show the scorn she poured on fashion’s\r\ncanting view of class distinction.\r\n\r\n    “I have seen,” she said, “somewhere in print that nursing is a\r\n    profession to be followed by the ‘lower middle-class.’ Shall we\r\n    say that painting or sculpture is a profession to be followed\r\n    by the ‘lower middle-class’? _Why limit the class at all?_ Or\r\n    shall we say that God is only to be served in His sick by the\r\n    ‘lower middle-class’?\r\n\r\n    “_It appears to be the most futile of all distinctions to\r\n    classify as between ‘paid’ and unpaid art, so between ‘paid’\r\n    and unpaid nursing, to make into a test a circumstance as\r\n    adventitious as whether the hair is black or brown—viz.,\r\n    whether people have private means or not, whether they are\r\n    obliged or not to work at their art or their nursing for a\r\n    livelihood._ Probably no person ever did that well which he did\r\n    only for money. Certainly no person ever did that well which\r\n    he did not work at as hard as if he did it solely for money.\r\n    If by amateur in art or in nursing are meant those who take it\r\n    up for play, it is not art at all, it is not nursing at all.\r\n    _You never yet made an artist by paying him well; but an artist\r\n    ought to be well paid._”\r\n\r\nThe woman who in later life wrote this, and all her life acted on it,\r\ncould not only well afford to let _Punch_ have his joke about the\r\nnightingales who would shortly turn into ringdoves—although, indeed,\r\n_Punch’s_ verses and illustration were delightful in their innocent\r\nfun—but could even without flinching let vulgar slander insinuate its\r\nusual common-minded nonsense. She herself has written in _Nursing Notes_:—\r\n\r\n    “The everyday management of a large ward, let alone of a\r\n    hospital, the knowing what are the laws of life and death\r\n    for men, and what the laws of health for wards (and wards are\r\n    healthy or unhealthy mainly according to the knowledge or\r\n    ignorance of the nurse)—are not these matters of sufficient\r\n    importance and difficulty to require learning by experience\r\n    and careful inquiry, just as much as any other art? They do\r\n    not come by inspiration to the lady disappointed in love, nor\r\n    to the poor workhouse drudge hard up for a livelihood. And\r\n    terrible is the injury which has followed to the sick from such\r\n    wild notions.”\r\n\r\nHappily, too, she was not blinded by the narrow sectarian view of\r\nreligion which was, in her day and generation, so often a part of the\r\nparrot belief of those who learned their English version of the faith by\r\nrote, rather than with the soul’s experience, for she goes on to say:—\r\n\r\n    “In this respect (and why is it so?) in Roman Catholic\r\n    countries, both writers and workers are, in theory at least,\r\n    far before ours. They would never think of such a beginning\r\n    for a good-working Superior or Sister of Charity. And many a\r\n    Superior has refused to admit a postulant who appeared to have\r\n    no better ‘vocation’ or reasons for offering herself than these.\r\n\r\n    “It is true we make no ‘vows.’ But is a ‘vow’ necessary to\r\n    convince us that the true spirit for learning any art, most\r\n    especially an art of charity, aright, is not a disgust to\r\n    everything or something else? Do we really place the love of\r\n    our kind (and of nursing as one branch of it) so low as this?\r\n    What would the Mère Angélique of Port Royal, what would our own\r\n    Mrs. Fry, have said to this?”\r\n\r\nHow silly, in the light of these words, was the gossip of the idle\r\nperson, proud of her shopping and her visiting list and her elaborate\r\nchoice of dinner, who greeted the news of this nursing embassy to the\r\nCrimea with such cheap remarks as that the women would be all invalided\r\nhome in a month; that it was most improper for “young ladies”—for it\r\nwas not only shop assistants who were called “young ladies” in early\r\nVictorian days—to nurse in a military hospital; it was only nonsense to\r\ntry and “nurse soldiers when they did not even yet know what it was to\r\nnurse a baby!”\r\n\r\nSuch folly would only shake its hardened old noddle on reading, in the\r\n_Times_ reprint of the article in the _Examiner_, that Miss Nightingale\r\nwas “a young lady of singular endowments both natural and acquired.\r\nIn a knowledge of the ancient languages and of the higher branches of\r\nmathematics, in general art, science, and literature, her attainments are\r\nextraordinary. There is scarcely a modern language which she does not\r\nunderstand, and she speaks French, German, and Italian as fluently as\r\nher native English. She has visited and studied all the various nations\r\nof Europe, and has ascended the Nile to its remotest cataract. Young\r\n(about the age of our Queen), graceful, feminine, rich, popular, she\r\nholds a singularly gentle and persuasive influence over all with whom she\r\ncomes in contact. Her friends and acquaintances are of all classes and\r\npersuasions, but her happiest place is at home, in the centre of a very\r\nlarge band of accomplished relatives.”\r\n\r\nGirton and Newnham, Somerville and Lady Margaret did not then exist.\r\nIf any one had dreamed of them, the dream had not yet been recorded.\r\nPerhaps its first recognized expression, in Tennyson’s “Princess” in\r\n1847, mingling as it does with the story of a war and of the nursing of\r\nwounded men, may have imperceptibly smoothed away a few coarse prejudices\r\nfrom the path Florence Nightingale was to tread, but far more effectually\r\nwas the way cleared by her own inspiring personality. Mrs. Tooley\r\nquotes from an intimate letter the following words: “Miss Nightingale\r\nis one of those whom God forms for great ends. You cannot hear her say\r\na few sentences—no, not even look at her—without feeling that she is\r\nan extraordinary being. Simple, intellectual, sweet, full of love and\r\nbenevolence, she is a fascinating and perfect woman. She is tall and\r\npale. Her face is exceedingly lovely, but better than all is the soul’s\r\nglory that shines through every feature so exultingly. Nothing can be\r\nsweeter than her smile. It is like a sunny day in summer.”\r\n\r\nShe who advised other women to make ready for the business of their lives\r\nas men make ready had been for long years preparing herself, and there\r\nwas therefore none of the nervous waste and excitement of those who in a\r\nmoment of impulse take a path which to their ignorance is like leaping in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nBut she knew well how much must depend on those she took with her, and it\r\nwas clear that many who desired to go were quite unfitted for the work.\r\n\r\nWith her usual clearsightedness she knew where to turn for help. Felicia\r\nSkene was among those whom she consulted and whose advice she found\r\nof good service. It has already been noted in these pages that Miss\r\nSkene had, without knowing it, been preparing one of the threads to be\r\ninterwoven in that living tapestry in which Miss Nightingale’s labours\r\nwere to endure in such glowing colours. Like Miss Nightingale she had\r\nreal intimacy with those outside her own order, and by her practical\r\nhuman sympathy understood life, not only in one rank, but in all ranks.\r\nBy night as well as by day her door was open to the outcast, and in\r\nseveral life-stories she had played a part which saved some poor girl\r\nfrom suicide. Full of humour and romance, and a welcome guest in\r\nevery society, she will be remembered longest for her work in rescuing\r\nothers both in body and in soul, and you will remember that, on the\r\ntwo occasions when the cholera visited Oxford, she nursed the sick and\r\nthe dying by day and by night, and did much to direct and organize the\r\nhelpful work of others. Miss Wordsworth speaks of her “innate purity of\r\nheart and mind,” and says of her, “one always felt of her that she had\r\nbeen brought up in the best of company, as indeed she had.” It was just\r\nsuch women that Miss Nightingale needed—women who, in constant touch with\r\nwhat was coarse and hard, could never become coarse or hard themselves;\r\nwomen versed in practical service and trained by actual experience as\r\nwell as by hard-won knowledge.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it chanced that after Miss Skene’s labour of love in the\r\ncholera visitation, her niece, “Miss Janie Skene, then a girl of fifteen,\r\nwho was staying in Constantinople with her parents, had gone with her\r\nmother to visit the wounded soldiers at Scutari. Shocked by their\r\nterrible sufferings and the lack of all that might have eased their\r\npain, she wrote strongly to her grandfather, who sent her letter to the\r\n_Times_, where it did much to stir up public opinion.”\r\n\r\n    “It struck Felicia,” says Miss Rickards, “that having with\r\n    great pains trained her corps of nurses for the cholera, they\r\n    might now be utilized at Scutari, her great desire being to go\r\n    out herself at the head of them. Had these events occurred at\r\n    the present day, when ideas have changed as to what ladies,\r\n    still young, may and may not do in the way of bold enterprise,\r\n    perhaps she might have obtained her parents’ permission to go.\r\n    As it was the notion was too new and startling to be taken into\r\n    consideration; and she had to content herself with doing all\r\n    she could at home to send out others.\r\n\r\n    “Her zeal was quickened by a letter she received from Lord\r\n    Stratford de Redcliffe, who had been much struck by her energy\r\n    and ability, urging her to do all she could in England to send\r\n    to the rescue.\r\n\r\n    “At once she set out as a pioneer in the undertaking,\r\n    delighted to encourage her nurses to take their part in the\r\n    heroic task.\r\n\r\n    “Meantime Miss Nightingale was hard at work enlisting recruits,\r\n    thankful to secure Felicia’s services as agent at Oxford. She\r\n    sent her friends Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge down there, that they\r\n    might inspect the volunteers and select the women they thought\r\n    would be suitable.\r\n\r\n    “The interviews took place in Mr. Skene’s dining-room, along\r\n    the walls of which the candidates were ranged.\r\n\r\n    “Kind-hearted as Mrs. Bracebridge was, her proceedings were\r\n    somewhat in the ‘Off with their heads!’ style of the famous\r\n    duchess in ‘Alice in Wonderland.’ If the sudden questions fired\r\n    at each in succession were not answered in a way that she\r\n    thought quite satisfactory, ‘She won’t do; send her out,’ was\r\n    the decided command.\r\n\r\n    “And Felicia had to administer balm to the wounded feelings of\r\n    the rejected.”[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    _The Expedition._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the thirty-eight nurses who went out with Miss Nightingale,\r\ntwenty-four had been trained in sisterhoods, Roman and Anglican, and of\r\nthe remaining fourteen, some had been chosen in the first instance by\r\nLady Maria Forrester, others by Miss Skene and Mrs. Bracebridge, but it\r\nmust be supposed that the final decision lay always with Miss Nightingale.\r\n\r\nThe correspondence that had poured in upon her and upon Mr. Herbert was\r\noverwhelming, and there was a personal interview with all who seemed in\r\nthe least degree likely to be admitted to her staff; so that she worked\r\nvery hard, with little pause for rest, to get through her ever-increasing\r\ntask in time. Each member of the staff undertook to obey her absolutely.\r\n\r\nAmong the many who were rejected, though most were unsuitable for\r\nquite other reasons, there were some who objected to this rule. Many\r\nwho were full of sympathy and generosity had to be turned away, because\r\nthey had not had enough training. Advertisements had appeared in the\r\n_Record_ and the _Guardian_, but the crowd of fair ladies who flocked\r\nto the War Office in response were not always received with such open\r\narms as they expected. Mr. Herbert was well on his guard against the\r\ncharms of impulsive, but ignorant, goodwill, and he issued a sort of\r\nlittle manifesto in which he said that “many ladies whose generous\r\nenthusiasm prompts them to offer services as nurses are little aware of\r\nthe hardships they would have to encounter, and the horrors they would\r\nhave to witness. Were all accepted who offer,” he added, with a touch of\r\nhumour, “I fear we should have not only many indifferent nurses, but many\r\nhysterical patients.”\r\n\r\nHe and his wife were untiring in their efficiency and their help.\r\n\r\nThe English Sisterhoods had made a difficulty about surrendering control\r\nover the Sisters they sent out, but Miss Nightingale overcame that, and\r\nthe Roman bishop entirely freed the ten Sisters of his communion from any\r\nrule which could clash with Miss Nightingale’s orders.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of October 21, 1854, that the “Angel Band,” as\r\nKinglake rightly names them, quietly set out under cover of darkness,\r\nescorted by a parson and a courier and by Miss Nightingale’s friends, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Bracebridge of Atherstone Hall.\r\n\r\nIn this way all flourish of trumpets was avoided. Miss Nightingale always\r\nhated public fuss—or, indeed, fuss of any kind. She was anxious also to\r\nlighten the parting for those who loved her best, and who had given a\r\nsomewhat doubting consent to her resolve.\r\n\r\nThe Quakerish plainness of her black dress did but make the more striking\r\nthe beauty of her lovely countenance, the firm, calm sweetness of the\r\nsmiling lips and steadfast eyes, the grace of the tall, slender figure;\r\nand as the train whirled her out of sight with her carefully-chosen\r\nregiment, she left with her friends a vision of good cheer and high\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nBut however quiet the setting forth, the arrival at Boulogne could not\r\nbe kept a secret, and the enthusiasm of our French allies for those who\r\nwere going to nurse the wounded made the little procession a heart-moving\r\ntriumph. A merry band of white-capped fishwives met the boat and,\r\nseizing all the luggage, insisted on doing everything for nothing.\r\nBoxes on their backs and bags in their hands, they ran along in their\r\nbright petticoats, pouring out their hearts about their own boys at the\r\nfront, and asking only the blessing of a handshake as the sole payment\r\nthey would take. Then, as Miss Nightingale’s train whistled its noisy\r\nway out of the station, waving their adieus while the tears streamed\r\ndown the weather-beaten cheeks of more than one old wife, they stood\r\nand watched with longing hearts. At Paris there was a passing visit to\r\nthe Mother-house of Miss Nightingale’s old friends, the Sisters of St.\r\nVincent de Paul, and a little call on Lady Canning, also an old friend,\r\nwho writes of her as “happy and stout-hearted.”\r\n\r\nThe poor “Angels” had a terrible voyage to Malta, for the wind, as\r\nwith St. Paul, was “contrary” and blew a hurricane dead against them,\r\nso that their ship, the _Vectis_, had something of a struggle to escape\r\nwith its many lives. They touched at Malta on October 31, 1854, and soon\r\nafterwards set sail again for Constantinople.\r\n\r\nWhat an old-world story it seems now to talk of “setting sail”!\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of November, the day before the battle of Inkermann, they had\r\nreached their goal, and had their work before them at Scutari.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who knows Scutari well has described it in summer as a\r\nplace of roses, the very graves wreathed all over with the blossoming\r\nbriars of them; and among those graves she found a nameless one, on\r\nwhich, without revealing identity, the epitaph stated, in the briefest\r\npossible way, that this was the grave of a hospital matron, adding in\r\ncomment the words spoken of Mary when she broke the alabaster box—and\r\nin this instance full of pathos—the six words, “She hath done what she\r\ncould.” And I find from one of Miss Nightingale’s letters that it was she\r\nherself who inscribed those words.\r\n\r\nUnspeakable indeed must have been the difficulties with which any\r\nprevious hospital matron had to contend, rigid and unbreakable for\r\nordinary fingers the red tape by which she must have been bound. On this\r\nsubject Kinglake has written words which are strong indeed in their\r\nhaunting sincerity.\r\n\r\nHe writes of an “England officially typified that swathes her limbs round\r\nwith red tape,” and of those who, though dogged in routine duty, were so\r\nafraid of any new methods that they were found “surrendering, as it were,\r\nat discretion, to want and misery” for those in their care.\r\n\r\n    “But,” he adds, “happily, after a while, and in gentle, almost\r\n    humble, disguise which put foes of change off their guard,\r\n    there acceded to the State a new power.\r\n\r\n    “Almost at one time—it was when they learnt how our troops had\r\n    fought on the banks of the Alma—the hearts of many women in\r\n    England, in Scotland, in Ireland, were stirred with a heavenly\r\n    thought impelling them to offer and say that, if only the\r\n    State were consenting, they would go out to tend our poor\r\n    soldiers laid low on their hospital pallets by sickness or\r\n    wounds; and the honour of welcoming into our public service\r\n    this new and gracious aid belonged to Mr. Sidney Herbert.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to explain and define Mr. Herbert’s exact position at the War\r\nOffice; how he was not only official chief there, but, “having perhaps\r\nalso learnt from life’s happy experience that, along with what he might\r\nowe to fortune and birth, his capacity for business of State, his frank,\r\npleasant speech, his bright, winning manners, and even his glad, sunshine\r\nlooks, had a tendency to disarm opposition, he quietly, yet boldly,\r\nstepped out beyond his set bounds, and not only became in this hospital\r\nbusiness the volunteer delegate of the Duke of Newcastle, but even\r\nventured to act without always asking the overworked Department of War\r\nto go through the form of supporting him by orders from the Secretary of\r\nState; so that thus, and to the great advantage of the public service, he\r\nusurped, as it were, an authority which all who knew what he was doing\r\nrejoiced to see him wield. If he could not in strictness command by an\r\nofficial despatch, he at least could impart what he wished in a ‘private\r\nletter;’ and a letter, though ostensibly ‘private,’ which came from the\r\nWar Office, under the hand of its chief, was scarce likely to encounter\r\nresistance from any official personages to whom the writer might send it.\r\n\r\n“Most happily this gifted minister had formed a strong belief in the\r\nadvantages our military hospitals would gain by accepting womanly aid;\r\nand, proceeding to act on this faith, he not only despatched to the East\r\nsome chosen bands of ladies, and of salaried attendants accustomed to\r\nhospital duties, but also requested that they might have quarters and\r\nrations assigned to them; and, moreover, whilst requesting the principal\r\nmedical officer at Scutari to point out to these new auxiliaries how best\r\nthey could make themselves useful, Mr. Sidney Herbert enjoined him to\r\nreceive with attention and deference the counsels of the Lady-in-Chief,\r\nwho was, of course, no other than Miss Nightingale herself.\r\n\r\n“That direction was one of great moment, and well calculated to govern\r\nthe fate of a newly ventured experiment.\r\n\r\n“Thus it was that, under the sanction of a government acceding to the\r\ncounsels of one of its most alert and sagacious members, there went out\r\nangel women from England, resolved to confront that whole world of horror\r\nand misery that can be gathered into a military hospital from camp or\r\nbattlefield; and their plea, when they asked to be trusted with this\r\npainful, this heart-rending mission, was simply the natural aptitude\r\nof their sex for ministering to those who lie prostrate from sickness\r\nand wounds. Using that tender word which likened the helplessness of\r\nthe down-stricken soldier to the helplessness of infancy, they only\r\nsaid they would ‘nurse’ him; and accordingly, if regarded with literal\r\nstrictness, their duty would simply be that of attendants in hospital\r\nwards—attendants obeying with strictness the orders of the medical\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n“It was seen that the humble soldiers were likely to be the men most in\r\nwant of care, and the ladies were instructed to abstain from attending\r\nupon any of the officers.”[8]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    _The tribute of Kinglake and Macdonald and the Chelsea\r\n    Pensioners._\r\n\r\n\r\nBut before continuing the story of Miss Nightingale’s expedition, we must\r\nturn aside for a moment in Kinglake’s company to realize something of the\r\ndevotion of another brave and unselfish Englishwoman who, without her\r\n“commanding genius,” yet trod the same path of sacrifice and compassion.\r\nThe words “commanding genius” were spoken by Dean Stanley of Miss\r\nNightingale, and it is of Dean Stanley’s sister Mary that a word must\r\nnow be spoken. She had been the right hand of her father, the Bishop of\r\nNorwich, and, in serving the poor, had disclosed special gifts, made\r\nthe more winning by her gentle, loving nature. Having had experience of\r\ntravel, which was much less a thing of course than it is in these days,\r\nshe was willing to escort a company of nurses chosen for work in the\r\nLevant, and at first this was all she expected to do. But there proved\r\nto be a difficulty about receiving them at Scutari, and she could not\r\nbring herself to leave them without guidance; so she quietly gave up all\r\nthought of returning to England while the war continued.\r\n\r\n    “Could she,” asks Kinglake, “see them in that strait disband,\r\n    when she knew but too well that their services were bitterly\r\n    needed for the shiploads and shiploads of stricken soldiery\r\n    brought down day by day from the seat of war? Under stress\r\n    of the question thus put by her own exacting conscience, or\r\n    perhaps by the simpler commandment of her generous heart, she\r\n    formed the heroic resolve which was destined to govern her life\r\n    throughout the long, dismal period of which she then knew not\r\n    the end. Instead of returning to England, and leaving on the\r\n    shores of the Bosphorus her band of sisters and nurses, she\r\n    steadfastly remained at their head, and along with them entered\r\n    at once upon what may be soberly called an appalling task—the\r\n    task of ‘nursing’ in hospitals not only overcrowded with\r\n    sufferers, but painfully, grievously wanting in most of the\r\n    conditions essential to all good hospital management.\r\n\r\n    “The sisters and salaried nurses,” says Kinglake, “who placed\r\n    themselves under this guidance were in all forty-six; and Miss\r\n    Stanley, with great spirit and energy, brought the aid of\r\n    her whole reinforcement—at first to the naval hospital newly\r\n    founded at Therapia under the auspices of our Embassy, and\r\n    afterwards to another establishment—to that fated hospital at\r\n    Kullali, in which, as we saw, at one time a fearful mortality\r\n    raged.\r\n\r\n    “Not regarding her mission as one that needs should aim loftily\r\n    at the reformation of the hospital management, Miss Stanley\r\n    submitted herself for guidance to the medical officers, saying,\r\n    ‘What do you wish us to do?’ The officers wisely determined\r\n    that they would not allow the gentle women to exhaust their\r\n    power of doing good by undertaking those kinds of work that\r\n    might be as well or better performed by men, and their answer\r\n    was to this effect: ‘The work that in surgical cases has been\r\n    commonly done by our dressers will be performed by them, as\r\n    before, under our orders. What we ask of you is that you will\r\n    see the men take the medicines and the nourishment ordered for\r\n    them, and we know we can trust that you will give them all that\r\n    watchful care which alleviates suffering, and tends to restore\r\n    health and strength.’\r\n\r\n    “With ceaseless devotion and energy the instructions were\r\n    obeyed. What number of lives were saved—saved even in\r\n    that pest-stricken hospital of Kullali—by a long, gentle\r\n    watchfulness, when science almost despaired, no statistics,\r\n    of course, can show; and still less can they gauge or record\r\n    the alleviation of misery effected by care such as this; but\r\n    apparent to all was the softened demeanour of the soldier\r\n    when he saw approaching his pallet some tender, gracious lady\r\n    intent to assuage his suffering, to give him the blessing of\r\n    hope, to bring him the food he liked, and withal—when she\r\n    came with the medicine—to rule him like a sick child. Coarse\r\n    expressions and oaths deriving from barracks and camps died\r\n    out in the wards as though exorcised by the sacred spell of her\r\n    presence, and gave way to murmurs of gratitude. When conversing\r\n    in this softened mood with the lady appointed to nurse him,\r\n    the soldier used often to speak as though the worship he owed\r\n    her and the worship he owed to Heaven were blending into one\r\n    sentiment; and sometimes, indeed, he disclosed a wild faith in\r\n    the ministering angel that strained beyond the grave. ‘Oh!’\r\n    said one to the lady he saw bending over his pallet, ‘you\r\n    are taking me on the way to heaven; don’t forsake me now!’\r\n    When a man was under delirium, its magic force almost always\r\n    transported him to the home of his childhood, and made him\r\n    indeed a child—a child crying, ‘Mother! mother!’ Amongst the\r\n    men generally, notwithstanding their moments of fitful piety,\r\n    there still glowed a savage desire for the fall of Sebastopol.\r\n    More than once—wafted up from Constantinople—the sound of great\r\n    guns was believed to announce a victory, and sometimes there\r\n    came into the wards fresh tidings of combat brought down from\r\n    our army in front of the long-besieged stronghold. When this\r\n    happened, almost all of the sufferers who had not yet lost\r\n    their consciousness used to show that, however disabled, they\r\n    were still soldiers—true soldiers. At such times, on many a\r\n    pallet, the dying man used to raise himself by unwonted effort,\r\n    and seem to yearn after the strife, as though he would answer\r\n    once more the appeal of the bugles and drums.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale at the Therapia Hospital.\r\n\r\n“I was sick, and ye visited me.”]\r\n\r\nKinglake’s touching description of what womanly tenderness could do for\r\nour soldiers, and of the worship it called forth, is followed by these\r\nwords:—\r\n\r\n    “But great would be the mistake of any chronicler fancying\r\n    that the advantage our country derived from womanly aid was\r\n    only an accession of nurses; for, if gifted with the power\r\n    to comfort and soothe, woman also—a still higher gift—can\r\n    impel, can disturb, can destroy pernicious content; and when\r\n    she came to the rescue in an hour of gloom and adversity,\r\n    she brought to her self-imposed task that forethought, that\r\n    agile brain power, that organizing and governing faculty of\r\n    which our country had need. The males at that time in England\r\n    were already giving proofs of the lameness in the use of\r\n    brain power, which afterwards became more distinct. Owing,\r\n    possibly, to their habits of industry, applied in fixed, stated\r\n    directions, they had lost that command of brain force which\r\n    kindles ‘initiative,’ and with it, of course, the faculty of\r\n    opportunely resorting to any very new ways of action. They\r\n    proved slow to see and to meet the fresh exigencies occasioned\r\n    by war, when approaching, or even by war when present; and,\r\n    apparently, in the hospital problem, they must have gone on\r\n    failing and failing indefinitely, if they had not undergone the\r\n    propulsion of the quicker—the woman’s—brain to ‘set them going’\r\n    in time.”\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to tell of the arrival at “the immense Barrack Hospital”\r\nat Scutari of Miss Nightingale and her chosen band. “If,” he says, “the\r\ngenerous women thus sacrificing themselves were all alike in devotion\r\nto their sacred cause, there was one of them—the Lady-in-Chief—who not\r\nonly came armed with the special experience needed, but also was clearly\r\ntranscendent in that subtle quality which gives to one human being a\r\npower of command over others. Of slender, delicate form, engaging,\r\nhighly-bred, and in council a rapt, careful listener, so long as others\r\nwere speaking; and strongly, though gently, persuasive whenever speaking\r\nherself, the Lady-in-Chief, the Lady Florence, Miss Nightingale, gave her\r\nheart to this enterprise in a spirit of absolute devotion; but her sway\r\nwas not quite of the kind that many in England imagined.”\r\n\r\nNo, indeed! Sentimentalists who talk as though she had been cast in the\r\nconventional mould of mere yielding amiability, do not realize what she\r\nhad to do, nor with what fearless, unflinching force she went straight\r\nto her mark, not heeding what was thought of herself, overlooking the\r\nnecessary wounds she must give to fools, caring only that the difficult\r\nduty should be done, the wholesale agony be lessened, the filth and\r\ndisorder be swept away.\r\n\r\nHer sweetness was the sweetness of strength, not weakness, and was\r\nreserved not for the careless, the stupid, the self-satisfied, but for\r\nthe men whose festering wounds and corrupting gangrene were suffered in\r\ntheir country’s pay, and had been increased by the heedless muddle of a\r\ncareless peace-time and a criminally mismanaged transport service.\r\n\r\nThe picture of their condition before her arrival is revolting in its\r\nhorror. There is no finer thing in the history of this war, perhaps, than\r\nthe heroism of the wounded and dying soldiers. We are told how, in the\r\nmidst of their appalling privation, if they fancied a shadow on their\r\nGeneral’s face—as well, indeed, there might be, when he saw them without\r\nthe common necessaries and decencies of life, let alone a sick-room—they\r\nwould seize the first possible opening for assuring him they had all they\r\nneeded, and if they were questioned by him, though they were dying of\r\ncold and hunger—\r\n\r\n    “No man ever used to say: ‘My Lord, you see how I am lying wet\r\n    and cold, with only this one blanket to serve me for bed and\r\n    covering. The doctors are wonderfully kind, but they have not\r\n    the medicines, nor the wine, nor any of the comforting things\r\n    they would like to be given me. If only I had another blanket,\r\n    I think perhaps I might live.’ Such words would have been true\r\n    to the letter.”\r\n\r\nBut as for Lord Raglan, the chief whom they thus adored, “with the\r\nabsolute hideous truth thus day by day spread out before him, he did not\r\nfor a moment deceive himself by observing that no man complained.”\r\n\r\nYet even cold and hunger were as nothing to the loathsome condition in\r\nwhich Miss Nightingale found the hospital at Scutari. There are certain\r\nkinds of filth which make life far more horrible than the brief moment\r\nof a brave death, and of filth of every sort that crowded hospital was\r\nfull—filth in the air, for the stench was horrible, filth and gore as the\r\nvery garment of the poor, patient, dying men.\r\n\r\nThere was no washing, no clean linen. Even for bandages the shirts had to\r\nbe stripped from the dead and torn up to stanch the wounds of the living.\r\n\r\nAnd there were other foul conditions which only the long labour of\r\nsanitary engineering could cure.\r\n\r\nThe arrival day by day of more and more of the wounded has been described\r\nas an avalanche. We all know Tennyson’s “Charge of the Light Brigade”:\r\nthat charge occurred at Balaclava the day before Miss Nightingale left\r\nEngland. And the terrible battle of Inkermann was fought the day after\r\nshe arrived at Scutari.\r\n\r\nHere is a word-for-word description from Nolan’s history of the campaign,\r\ngiven also in Mrs. Tooley’s admirable “Life”:—\r\n\r\n    “There were no vessels for water or utensils of any kind; no\r\n    soap, towels, or cloths, no hospital clothes; the men lying in\r\n    their uniforms, stiff with gore and covered with filth to a\r\n    degree and of a kind no one could write about; their persons\r\n    covered with vermin, which crawled about the floors and walls\r\n    of the dreadful den of dirt, pestilence, and death to which\r\n    they were consigned.\r\n\r\n    “Medical assistance would naturally be expected by the invalid\r\n    as soon as he found himself in a place of shelter, but many lay\r\n    waiting for their turn until death anticipated the doctor. The\r\n    medical men toiled with unwearied assiduity, but their numbers\r\n    were inadequate to the work.”\r\n\r\nThe great hospital at Scutari is a quadrangle, each wing nearly a quarter\r\nof a mile long, and built in tiers of corridors and galleries, one above\r\nthe other. The wounded men had been brought in and laid on the floor,\r\nside by side, as closely as they could lie, so that Kinglake was writing\r\nquite literally when he spoke of “miles of the wounded.”\r\n\r\nRotting beneath an Eastern sky and filling the air with poison, Miss\r\nNightingale counted the carcasses of six dead dogs lying under the\r\nhospital windows. And in all the vast building there was no cooking\r\napparatus, though it did boast of what was supposed to be a kitchen. As\r\nfor our modern bathrooms, the mere notion would have given rise to bitter\r\nlaughter; for even the homely jugs and basins were wanting in that\r\npalace of a building, and water of any kind was a rare treasure.\r\n\r\nHow were sick men to be “nursed,” when they could not even be washed,\r\nand their very food had to be carried long distances and was usually the\r\nworst possible!\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale—the Lady-in-Chief—had the capacity, the will, the\r\ndriving power, to change all that.\r\n\r\nA week or two ago I had some talk with several of the old pensioners who\r\nremember her. The first to be introduced to me has lost now his power of\r\nspeech through a paralytic stroke, but it was almost surprising, after\r\nall these long years that have passed between the Crimean day and our\r\nown day, to see how well-nigh overwhelming was the dumb emotion which\r\nmoved the strong man at the naming of her name. The second, who was full\r\nof lively, chuckling talk, having been in active service for a month\r\nbefore her arrival in the Crimea, and himself seen the wondrous changes\r\nshe wrought, was not only one of her adorers—all soldiers seem to be\r\nthat—but also overflowing with admiration for her capability, her pluck.\r\nTo him she was not only the ideal nurse, but also emphatically a woman of\r\nunsurpassed courage and efficiency.\r\n\r\n“You know, miss,” he said, “there was a many young doctors out there that\r\nshould never have been there—they didn’t know their duty and they didn’t\r\ndo as they should for us—and she chased ’em, ay, she did that! She got\r\nrid of ’em, and there was better ones come in their place, and it was\r\nall quite different. Oh yes,” and he laughed delightedly, as a schoolboy\r\nmight. “Oh yes, she hunted ’em out.” I, who have a great reverence for\r\nthe medical profession, felt rather shy and frightened and inclined\r\nto blush, but the gusto with which the veteran recalled a righteous\r\nvengeance on the heads of the unworthy was really very funny. And his\r\ngargoyle mirth set in high relief the tenderness with which he told of\r\nMiss Nightingale’s motherly ways with his poor wounded comrades, and how\r\nshe begged them not to mind having their wounds washed, any more than if\r\nshe were really their mother or sister, and thus overcame any false shame\r\nthat might have prevented their recovery. “Ah, she was a good woman,” he\r\nkept repeating, “there’s no two ways about it, a _good_ woman!”\r\n\r\nFrom Pensioner John Garrett of the 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards, I had\r\none very interesting bit of history at first hand; for he volunteered the\r\nfact that on his first arrival in the Crimea—which was evidently about\r\nthe same time as Miss Nightingale’s own, his first engagement having\r\nbeen the battle of Inkermann—Miss Nightingale being still unknown to\r\nthe soldiers—a mere name to them—she had much unpopularity to overcome.\r\nClearly jealous rumour had been at work against this mere woman who was\r\ncoming, as the other pensioner had phrased it, “to chase the doctors.”\r\nThis, of course, made the completeness of her rapid victory over the\r\nhearts of the entire army the more noteworthy.\r\n\r\n“And afterwards?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, _afterwards we knew what she was_, and she was very popular indeed!”\r\nThough he treasured and carried about with him everywhere a Prayer Book\r\ncontaining Florence Nightingale’s autograph—which I told him ought to be\r\na precious heirloom to his sons and their children, and therefore refused\r\nto accept, when in the generosity of his kind old heart he thrice tried\r\nto press it upon me—he had only seen her once; for he was camping out at\r\nthe front, and it was on one of her passing visits that he had his vision\r\nof her. He is a very young-looking old man of eighty-two, Suffolk-born,\r\nand had been in the army from boyhood up to the time of taking his\r\npension. He had fought in the battle of Inkermann and done valiant\r\ntrench-duty before Sebastopol, and confirmed quite of his own accord\r\nthe terrible accounts that have come to us of the privations suffered.\r\n“Water,” he said, “why, we could scarce get water to drink—much less to\r\nwash—why, I hadn’t a change of linen all the winter through.”\r\n\r\n“And you hadn’t much food, I hear, for your daily rations?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Oh, we didn’t have food every _day_!” said he, with a touch of gently\r\nscornful laughter. “Every _three_ days or so, we may have had some\r\nbiscuits served out. But there was a lot of the food as wasn’t fit to\r\neat.”\r\n\r\nHe was, however, a man of few words, and when I asked him what Miss\r\nNightingale was like, he answered rather unexpectedly and with great\r\npromptitude, “Well, she had a very nice figger.” All the same, though he\r\ndid not dilate on the beauty of her countenance, and exercised a certain\r\nreserve of speech when I tried to draw him out about the Lady-in-Chief,\r\nit was clear that hers was a sacred name to him, and that the bit of her\r\nhandwriting which he possessed in the little book, so carefully unwrapped\r\nfor me from the tin box holding his dearest possessions, which he\r\nuncorded under my eyes with his own capable but rather tired old hands,\r\nbetween two bouts of his wearying cough, had for long been the great joy\r\nand pride of his present quiet existence.\r\n\r\nI had a talk with others of these veterans in their stately and\r\nwell-earned home of rest in the Royal Hospital at Chelsea, and it was\r\nclear that to them all she was enshrined in memory’s highest place. This\r\nmay be a fitting moment for recording the tribute of Mr. Macdonald, the\r\nadministrator of the _Times_ Fund, who wrote of her before his return to\r\nEngland:—\r\n\r\n    “Wherever there is disease in its most dangerous form, and\r\n    the hand of the spoiler distressingly nigh, there is that\r\n    incomparable woman sure to be seen; her benignant presence\r\n    is an influence for good comfort, even among the struggles\r\n    of expiring nature. She is a ‘ministering angel,’ without\r\n    any exaggeration, in these hospitals, and, as her slender\r\n    form glides quietly along each corridor, every poor fellow’s\r\n    face softens with gratitude at the sight of her. When all\r\n    the medical officers have retired for the night, and silence\r\n    and darkness have settled down upon those miles of prostrate\r\n    sick, she may be observed alone, with a little lamp in her\r\n    hand, making her solitary rounds. The popular instinct was\r\n    not mistaken, which, when she had set out from England on her\r\n    mission of mercy, hailed her as a heroine; I trust she may not\r\n    earn her title to a higher though sadder appellation. No one\r\n    who has observed her fragile figure and delicate health can\r\n    avoid misgivings lest these should fail. With the heart of a\r\n    true woman, and the manners of a lady, accomplished and refined\r\n    beyond most of her sex, she combines a surprising calmness of\r\n    judgment and promptitude and decision of character.”\r\n\r\nThe soldier who watched for her coming, night by night, on her quiet\r\nrounds, after dark, when other nurses were by her orders resting, and\r\nwho only knew her as “the Lady with the Lamp,” has been quoted all over\r\nthe world; but it has been well said that she was also “the lady with\r\nthe brain.” Hercules had not so big a task before him when he cleansed\r\nthe Augean stables, and the swiftness with which order and comfort were\r\ncreated in this “hell” of suffering—for so it has been named by those who\r\nsaw and knew—might well be called one of the wonders of the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “A Mission of Mercy.” Florence Nightingale at Scutari.\r\n\r\n(_After the painting by J. Barratt._)]\r\n\r\nThe secret lay partly in the fact that Florence Nightingale’s whole\r\nlife had been an offering and a preparation. She knew all it had been\r\npossible for her to learn of hospital management and training. She never\r\nwasted words, nor frittered away her power. Her authority grew daily. Mr.\r\nHerbert’s support, even at so great a distance, was, of course, beyond\r\nprice. Lord Raglan soon found the value of her letters. She inspired\r\nher orderlies with utmost devotion, and it is needless to speak of what\r\nher patients themselves felt to her. Kinglake is not, like the present\r\nwriter, a woman, and therefore he can write with a good grace and from\r\nhis own knowledge what might come with an ill grace from a woman’s pen.\r\nHe shall again therefore be quoted, word for word, through a few pages.\r\n\r\n    “The growth of her dominion was rapid, was natural, and\r\n    not unlike the development of what men call ‘responsible\r\n    government.’ One of others accepting a task ostensibly\r\n    subordinate and humble, she yet could not, if she would,\r\n    divest herself of the authority that belonged to her as a\r\n    gentlewoman—as a gentlewoman abounding in all the natural\r\n    gifts, and all the peculiar knowledge required for hospital\r\n    management. Charged to be in the wards, to smooth the\r\n    sufferer’s pillow, to give him his food and his medicine as\r\n    ordered by the medical officers, she could not but speak\r\n    with cogency of the state of the air which she herself had\r\n    to breathe; she could not be bidden to acquiesce if the beds\r\n    she approached were impure; she could scarcely be held to\r\n    silence if the diet she had been told to administer were not\r\n    forthcoming; and, whatever her orders, she could hardly be\r\n    expected to give a sufferer food which she perceived to be bad\r\n    or unfit. If the males[9] did not quite understand the peculiar\r\n    contrivances fitted for the preparation of hospital diet,\r\n    might she not, perhaps, disclose her own knowledge, and show\r\n    them what to do? Or, if they could not be taught, or imagined\r\n    that they had not the power to do what was needed, might not\r\n    she herself compass her object by using the resources which\r\n    she had at command? Might not she herself found and organize\r\n    the requisite kitchens, when she knew that the difference\r\n    between fit and unfit food was one of life and death to the\r\n    soldier? And again, if she chose, might she not expend her own\r\n    resources in striving against the foul poisons that surrounded\r\n    our prostrate soldiery? Rather, far, than that even one man\r\n    should suffer from those cruel wants which she generously chose\r\n    to supply, it was well that the State should be humbled, and\r\n    submit to the taunt which accused it of taking alms from her\r\n    hand.\r\n\r\n    “If we learnt that the cause of the evils afflicting our\r\n    Levantine hospitals was a want of impelling and of governing\r\n    power, we now see how the want was supplied. In the absence of\r\n    all constituted authority proving equal to the emergency, there\r\n    was need—dire need—of a firm, well-intentioned usurper; but\r\n    amongst the males acting at Scutari there was no one with that\r\n    resolute will, overstriding law, habit, and custom, which the\r\n    cruel occasion required; for even Dr. M’Gregor, whose zeal and\r\n    abilities were admirable, omitted to lay hold, dictatorially,\r\n    of that commanding authority which—because his chief could\r\n    not wield it—had fallen into abeyance. The will of the males\r\n    was always to go on performing their accustomed duties\r\n    industriously, steadily, faithfully, each labouring to the\r\n    utmost, and, if need be, even to death (as too often, indeed,\r\n    was the case), in that groove-going ‘state of life to which it\r\n    had pleased God to call him.’ The will of the woman, whilst\r\n    stronger, flew also more straight to the end;[10] for what she\r\n    almost fiercely sought was—not to make good mere equations\r\n    between official codes of duty and official acts of obedience,\r\n    but—overcoming all obstacles, to succour, to save our prostrate\r\n    soldiery, and turn into a well-ordered hospital the hell—the\r\n    appalling hell—of the vast barrack wards and corridors. Nature\r\n    seemed, as it were, to ordain that in such a conjuncture the\r\n    all-essential power which our cramped, over-disciplined males\r\n    had chosen to leave unexerted should pass to one who would\r\n    seize it, should pass to one who could wield it—should pass to\r\n    the Lady-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n    “To have power was an essential condition of success in her\r\n    sacred cause; and of power accordingly she knew and felt the\r\n    worth, rightly judging that, in all sorts of matters within\r\n    what she deemed its true range, her word must be law. Like\r\n    other dictators, she had cast upon her one duty which no one\r\n    can hope to perform without exciting cavil. For the sake of\r\n    the cause, she had to maintain her dictatorship, and (on pain\r\n    of seeing her efforts defeated by anarchical action) to check\r\n    the growth of authority—of authority in even small matters—if\r\n    not derived from herself. She was apparently careful in this\r\n    direction; and, though outwardly calm when provoked, could give\r\n    strong effect to her anger. On the other hand, when seeing\r\n    merit in the labours of others, she was ready with generous\r\n    praise. It was hardly in the nature of things that her sway\r\n    should excite no jealousies, or that always, hand in hand with\r\n    the energy which made her great enterprise possible, there\r\n    should be the cold, accurate justice at which the slower sex\r\n    aims; but she reigned—painful, heart-rending empire—in a spirit\r\n    of thorough devotion to the objects of her care, and, upon the\r\n    whole, with excellent wisdom.\r\n\r\n    “To all the other sources of power which we have seen her\r\n    commanding, she added one of a kind less dependent upon\r\n    her personal qualities. Knowing thoroughly the wants of a\r\n    hospital, and foreseeing, apparently, that the State might\r\n    fail to meet them, she had taken care to provide herself with\r\n    vast quantities of hospital stores, and by drawing upon these\r\n    to make good the shortcoming of any hampered or lazy official,\r\n    she not only furnished our soldiery with the things they were\r\n    needing, but administered to the defaulting administrator a\r\n    telling, though silent, rebuke; and it would seem that under\r\n    this discipline the groove-going men winced in agony, for they\r\n    uttered touching complaints, declaring that the Lady-in-Chief\r\n    did not choose to give them time (it was always time that the\r\n    males wanted), and that the moment a want declared itself she\r\n    made haste to supply it herself.”\r\n\r\nAnother able writer—a woman—has said that for Miss Nightingale the\r\ntesting moment of her life met her with the coming of the wagon-loads\r\nof wounded men from the battlefield of Inkermann, who were poured into\r\nthe hospital at Scutari within twenty-four hours of her arrival. Had the\r\nsight of all that agony and of the senseless confusion that received\r\nit, led the Lady-in-Chief and her nurses to waste their power in rushing\r\nhither and thither in disorganized fear of defeat, their very sympathy\r\nand emotion dimming their foresight and clouding their brain, the whole\r\nstory might have been different. But Miss Nightingale was of those who,\r\nby a steadfast obedience hour by hour to the voice within, have attained\r\nthrough the long years to a fine mastery of every nerve and muscle of\r\nthat frail house wherein they dwell. The more critical the occasion, the\r\nmore her will rose to meet it. She knew she must think of the welfare,\r\nnot of one, but of thousands; and for tens of thousands she wrought the\r\nchange from this welter of misery and death to that clean orderliness\r\nwhich for the moment seemed as far away as the unseen heaven. There\r\nwere many other faithful and devoted nurses in the Crimea, though few,\r\nperhaps, so highly skilled; but her name stands alone as that of the\r\nhigh-hearted and daring spirit who made bold to change the evil system\r\nof the past when no man else had done anything but either consent to it\r\nor bemoan it. She, at least, had never been bound by red tape, and her\r\nwhole soul rose up in arms at sight of the awful suffering which had been\r\nallowed under the shelter of dogged routine.\r\n\r\nBefore ten days had passed, she had her kitchen ready and was feeding 800\r\nmen every day with well-cooked food, and this in spite of the unforeseen\r\nand overwhelming numbers in which the new patients had been poured into\r\nthe hospitals after Balaclava and Inkermann. She had brought out with\r\nher, in the _Vectis_, stores of invalid food, and all sorts of little\r\ndelicacies surprised the eyes and lips of the hitherto half-starved men.\r\nTheir gentle nurses brought them beef tea, chicken broth, jelly. They\r\nwere weak and in great pain, and may be forgiven if their gratitude was,\r\nas we are told, often choked with sobs.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tooley tells us of one Crimean veteran, that when he received a\r\nbasin of arrowroot on his first arrival at the hospital early in the\r\nmorning, he said to himself, “‘Tommy, me boy, that’s all you’ll get into\r\nyour inside this blessed day, and think yourself lucky you’ve got that.’\r\nBut two hours later, if another of them blessed angels didn’t come\r\nentreating of me to have just a little chicken broth! Well, I took that,\r\nthinking maybe it was early dinner, and before I had well done wondering\r\nwhat would happen next, round the nurse came again with a bit o’ jelly;\r\nand all day long at intervals they kept on bringing me what they called\r\n‘a little nourishment.’ In the evening, Miss Nightingale she came and had\r\na look at me, and says she, ‘I hope you’re feeling better?’ I could have\r\nsaid, ‘Ma’am, I feels as fit as a fightin’ cock,’ but I managed to git\r\nout somethin’ a bit more polite.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe barracks had thirteen “coppers,” and in the old days meat and\r\nvegetables had just been tossed into these and boiled together anyhow.\r\nIt is easy to imagine the greasy mess to which the fevered invalids must\r\nhave been treated by the time the stuff had been carried round to the\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nBut now, sometimes in a single day, thirteen gallons of chicken broth,\r\nand forty gallons of arrowroot found their way from the new kitchen to\r\nthe hospital wards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n    _The horrors of Scutari—The victory of the Lady-in-Chief—The\r\n    Queen’s letter—Her gift of butter and treacle._\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale’s discipline was strict; she did not mind the name\r\nof autocrat when men were dying by twenties for lack of what only an\r\nautocrat could do; and when there was continual loss of life for want\r\nof fitting nourishment, though there had been supplies sent out, as had\r\nbeen said “by the ton-weight,” she herself on at least one occasion,\r\nbroke open the stores and fed her famishing patients. It is true that\r\nthe ordinary matron would have been dismissed for doing so; she was not\r\nan ordinary matron—she was the Lady-in-Chief. To her that hath shall be\r\ngiven. She had grudged nothing to the service to which from childhood\r\nshe had given herself—not strength, nor time, nor any other good gift\r\nof her womanhood, and having done her part nobly, fortune aided her.\r\nHer friends were among the “powers that be,” and even her wealth was, in\r\nthis particular battle, a very important means of victory. Her beauty\r\nwould have done little for her if she had been incompetent, but being to\r\nthe last degree efficient, her loveliness gave the final touch to her\r\npower—her loveliness and that personal magnetism which gave her sway\r\nover the hearts and minds of men, and also, let it be added, of women.\r\nNot only did those in authority give to her of their best—their best\r\nknowledge, their closest attention, their most untiring service—but she\r\nknew how to discern the true from the false, and to put to the best use\r\nthe valuable information often confided to her. She had many helpers.\r\nBesides her thirty-eight nurses and the chaplain, Mr. Sidney Osborne,\r\nthere were her friends, Mr. and Mrs. Bracebridge, and that splendid\r\n“fag,” as he called himself, the young “Mr. Stafford,”[12] who had left\r\nthe gaieties of London to fetch and carry for the Lady-in-Chief, and—to\r\nquote Mrs. Tooley, “did anything and everything which a handy and\r\ngallant gentleman could do to make himself useful to the lady whom he\r\nfelt honoured to serve.” Among those who were most thoughtful in their\r\nlittle gifts for the wounded officers was the wife of our ambassador,\r\nLady Stratford de Redcliffe, and her “beauteous guest,” as Kinglake calls\r\nher, Lady George Paget. But Miss Nightingale’s chief anxiety was not for\r\nthe officers—they, like herself, had many influences in their favour—her\r\nthought was for the nameless rank and file, who had neither money nor\r\nrank, and were too often, as she knew, the forgotten pawns on the big\r\nchessboard. It was said “she thought only of the men;” she understood\r\nwell that for their commanders her thought was less needed.\r\n\r\n“In the hearts of thousands and thousands of our people,” says Kinglake,\r\n“there was a yearning to be able to share the toil, the distress, the\r\ndanger of battling for our sick and wounded troops against the sea\r\nof miseries that encompassed them on their hospital pallets; and men\r\nstill remember how graciously, how simply, how naturally, if so one may\r\nspeak, the ambassadress Lady Stratford de Redcliffe and her beauteous\r\nguest gave their energies and their time to the work; still remember\r\nthe generous exertions of Mr. Sidney Osborne and Mr. Joscelyne Percy;\r\nstill remember, too, how Mr. Stafford—I would rather call him ‘Stafford\r\nO’Brien’—the cherished yet unspoilt favourite of English society,\r\ndevoted himself heart and soul to the task of helping and comforting our\r\nprostrate soldiery in the most frightful depths of their misery.\r\n\r\n“Many found themselves embarrassed when trying to choose the best\r\ndirection they could for their generous impulses; and not, I think,\r\nthe least praiseworthy of all the self-sacrificing enterprises which\r\nimagination devised was that of the enthusiastic young fellow who,\r\nabandoning his life of ease, pleasure, and luxury, went out, as he\r\nprobably phrased it, to ‘fag’ for the Lady-in-Chief. Whether fetching\r\nand carrying for her, or writing for her letters or orders, or orally\r\nconveying her wishes to public servants or others, he, for months and\r\nmonths, faithfully toiled, obeying in all things her word.\r\n\r\n“There was grace—grace almost mediæval—in his simple yet romantic idea;\r\nand, if humbly, still not the less usefully he aided the sacred cause,\r\nfor it was one largely, mainly dependent on the power of the lady he\r\nserved; so that, when by obeying her orders he augmented her means of\r\naction, and saved her precious time, there were unnumbered sufferers\r\nderiving sure benefit from his opportune, well-applied help. By no other\r\nkind of toil, however ambitiously aimed, could he well have achieved so\r\nmuch good.”\r\n\r\nBut there was many a disappointment, much that did not seem “good luck”\r\nby any means, and that called for great courage and endurance. The\r\nstores, which Mr. Herbert had sent out in such abundance, had gone to\r\nVarna by mistake, and the loss of the _Prince_, a ship laden with ample\r\nsupplies, a fortnight after Miss Nightingale’s arrival, was a very\r\nserious matter.\r\n\r\nWarm clothing for the frost-bitten men brought in from Sebastopol was so\r\nbadly needed that one nurse, writing home, told her people: “Whenever\r\na man opens his mouth with ‘Please, ma’am, I want to speak to you,’ my\r\nheart sinks within me, for I feel sure it will end in flannel shirts.”\r\n\r\nEvery one had for too long been saying “all right,” when, as a matter of\r\nfact, it was all wrong. Here once again it is best to quote Kinglake.\r\n“By shunning the irksome light,” he says, “by choosing a low standard of\r\nexcellence, and by vaguely thinking ‘War’ an excuse for defects which\r\nwar did not cause, men, it seems, had contrived to be satisfied with\r\nthe condition of our hospitals; but the Lady-in-Chief was one who would\r\nharbour no such content, seek no such refuge from pain. Not for her was\r\nthe bliss—fragile bliss—of dwelling in any false paradise. She confronted\r\nthe hideous truth. Her first care was—Eve-like—to dare to know, and—still\r\nEve-like—to force dreaded knowledge on the faltering lord of creation.\r\nThen declaring against acquiescence in horror and misery which firmness\r\nand toil might remove, she waged her ceaseless war against custom and\r\nsloth, gaining every day on the enemy, and achieving, as we saw, in\r\nDecember, that which to eyes less intent than her own upon actual saving\r\nof life, and actual restoration of health, seemed already the highest\r\nexcellence.”\r\n\r\nBut, of course, what most made the men adore her was her loving\r\nindividual care for each of those for whom she felt herself responsible.\r\nThere was one occasion on which she begged to be allowed to try whether\r\nshe could nurse back to possible life five wounded men who were being\r\ngiven up as “hopeless cases,” and did actually succeed in doing so.\r\n\r\nIn all that terrible confusion of suffering that surrounded her soon\r\nafter her first arrival, the first duty of the doctors was to sort out\r\nfrom the wounded as they arrived those cases which they could help and\r\nsave from those which it seemed no human surgery could help.\r\n\r\nWhile this was being done she stood by: she never spared herself the\r\nsight of suffering, and her eyes—the trained eyes that had all the\r\nintuition of a born nurse—saw a glimmer of hope for five badly wounded\r\nmen who were being set aside among those for whom nothing could be done.\r\n\r\n“Will you give me those five men?” she asked. She knew how much might\r\nbe done by gentle and gradual feeding, and by all the intently watchful\r\ncare of a good nurse, to give them just enough strength to risk the\r\nsurgery that might save them. With her own hand, spoonful by spoonful,\r\nas they were able to bear it, she gave the nourishment, and by her own\r\nnight-long watching and tending in the care of all those details which\r\nto a poor helpless patient may make the difference between life and\r\ndeath—the purifying of the air, the avoidance of draughts, the mending of\r\nthe fire—she nursed her five patients back into a condition in which the\r\nrisks of an operation were, to say the least of it, greatly lessened. The\r\noperation was in each case successfully performed; by all human standards\r\nit may be said that she saved the lives of all the five.\r\n\r\nShe never spared herself, though she sometimes spared others. She has\r\nbeen known to stand for twenty hours out of the twenty-four, and at\r\nnight, when she had sent her day-nurses to rest, it was she herself\r\nwho watched in all the wards and silently cared for the needs of one\r\nand another. Is it any wonder that “there was worship almost in the\r\ngratitude of the prostrate sufferer, who saw her glide into his ward,\r\nand at last approach his bedside? The magic of her power over men used\r\noften to be felt in the room—the dreaded, the blood-stained room—where\r\n‘operations’ took place. There, perhaps, the maimed soldier, if not yet\r\nresigned to his fate, might at first be craving death rather than meet\r\nthe knife of the surgeon; but, when such a one looked and saw that the\r\nhonoured Lady-in-Chief was patiently standing beside him, and—with lips\r\nclosely set and hands folded—decreeing herself to go through the pain of\r\nwitnessing pain, he used to fall into the mood for obeying her silent\r\ncommand, and—finding strange support in her presence—bring himself to\r\nsubmit and endure.”[13]\r\n\r\nM. Soyer, who placed his culinary art at her service, has written a book\r\nabout his experiences in which he tells us that, after a merry evening in\r\nthe doctors’ quarters, when on his way back to his own, he saw by a faint\r\nlight a little group—shadowy in the half-darkness—in a corner of one\r\nof the corridors. A Sister stood beside Miss Nightingale with a lighted\r\ncandle that she might see clearly enough to scribble down the last wishes\r\nof the dying soldier who was supported on the bed beside her. With its\r\ndeep colouring, described as like a grave study by Rembrandt, the little\r\npicture drew the passer-by, and for a few minutes he watched unseen while\r\nthe Lady-in-Chief took into those “tender womanly hands” the watch and\r\ntrinkets of the soldier, who with his last gasping breath was trying to\r\nmake clear to her his farewell message to his wife and children. And this\r\nseems to have been but one among many kindred scenes.\r\n\r\nWe have all heard of the man who watched till her shadow fell across the\r\nwall by his bed that he might at least kiss that shadow as it passed; but\r\nfew of us, perhaps, know the whole story. The man was a Highland soldier\r\nwho had been doomed to lose his arm by amputation. Miss Nightingale\r\nbelieved that she might possibly be able to save the arm by careful\r\nnursing, and she begged that she might at least be allowed to try.\r\nNursing was to her an art as well as a labour of love. The ceaseless care\r\nin matters of detail, which she considered the very alphabet of that art,\r\nstand out clearly in her own _Notes on Nursing_. And in this instance her\r\nskill and watchfulness and untiring effort saved the man’s arm. No wonder\r\nthat he wanted to kiss her shadow!\r\n\r\nTo the wives of the soldiers she was indeed a saving angel. When she\r\narrived at Scutari, they were living, we are told, literally in holes and\r\ncorners of the hospital. Their clothes were worn out. They had neither\r\nbonnets, nor shoes, nor any claim on rations. Poor faithful creatures,\r\nmany of them described in the biographies as respectable and decent, they\r\nhad followed their husbands through all the horrors of the campaign, and\r\nnow, divided from them and thrust aside for want of space, they were\r\nindeed in sorry case.\r\n\r\nWell might Miss Nightingale write later, and well may we all lay it to\r\nheart—“When the improvements in our system are discussed, let not the\r\nwife and child of the soldier be forgotten.”\r\n\r\nAfter being moved about from one den to another, the poor women—some\r\nwives and some, alas, widows—had been quartered in a few damp rooms in\r\nthe hospital basement, where those who wanted solitude or privacy could\r\ndo nothing to secure it beyond hanging a few rags on a line as a sort of\r\nscreen between home and home. And in these desolate quarters many babies\r\nhad been born.\r\n\r\nIt was but the last drop of misery in their cup when, early in 1855,\r\na month or two after Miss Nightingale’s arrival, a drain broke in the\r\nbasement, and fever followed.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale had already sought them out, and from her own stores\r\ngiven them food and clothing; but now she did not rest until through her\r\ninfluence a house had been requisitioned and cleaned and furnished for\r\nthem out of her own funds. Next, after fitting out the widows to return\r\nto their homes, employment was found for the wives who remained. Work was\r\nfound for some of them in Constantinople, but for most of them occupation\r\nwas at hand in the laundry she had set going, and there those who were\r\nwilling to do their part could earn from 10s. to 14s. a week. In this\r\nway, through our heroine’s wise energy, helped by the wife and daughter\r\nof Dr. Blackwood, one of the army chaplains, we are told that about 500\r\nwomen were cared for.\r\n\r\nThere had already arrived through the hands of Mr. Sidney Herbert, who\r\nforwarded it to Miss Nightingale, a message from Queen Victoria—in effect\r\na letter—which greatly cheered the army and also strengthened Miss\r\nNightingale’s position.\r\n\r\n                                “WINDSOR CASTLE, _December 6, ’54_.\r\n\r\n    “Would you tell Mrs. Herbert,” wrote the Queen to Mr.\r\n    Sidney Herbert, “that I beg she would let me see frequently\r\n    the accounts she receives from Miss Nightingale or Mrs.\r\n    Bracebridge, as I hear no details of the wounded, though I\r\n    see so many from officers, etc., about the battlefield, and\r\n    naturally the former must interest me more than any one.\r\n\r\n    “Let Mrs. Herbert also know that I wish Miss Nightingale and\r\n    the ladies would tell these poor, noble wounded and sick men\r\n    that no one takes a warmer interest or feels more for their\r\n    sufferings or admires their courage and heroism more than their\r\n    Queen. Day and night she thinks of her beloved troops. So does\r\n    the Prince.\r\n\r\n    “Beg Mrs. Herbert to communicate these my words to those\r\n    ladies, as I know that our sympathy is much valued by these\r\n    noble fellows.\r\n\r\n                                                       “VICTORIA.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale agreed with the Queen in her use of the word “noble”\r\nhere, for she herself has written of the men:—\r\n\r\n    “Never came from any of them one word nor one look which a\r\n    gentleman would not have used; and while paying this humble\r\n    tribute to humble courtesy, the tears come into my eyes as I\r\n    think how, amidst scenes of ... loathsome disease and death,\r\n    there rose above it all the innate dignity, gentleness, and\r\n    chivalry of the men (for never, surely, was chivalry so\r\n    strikingly exemplified), shining in the midst of what must be\r\n    considered as the lowest sinks of human misery, and preventing\r\n    instinctively the use of one expression which could distress a\r\n    gentlewoman.”\r\n\r\nHaving transcribed the Queen’s letter, this may be a good place for\r\nadding from the letters of Sister Aloysius a little instance of Her\r\nMajesty’s homely kindness to her troops whenever she heard of any need\r\nwhich she could supply:—\r\n\r\n    “When Miss Stanley reached England, Her Majesty the Queen\r\n    (anxious, of course, to hear all about her soldiers) sent for\r\n    her; and when the interview was nearly over Her Majesty asked\r\n    her what she thought the poor soldiers would like—she was\r\n    anxious to send them a present. Miss Stanley said: ‘Oh, I do\r\n    know what they would like—plenty of flannel shirts, mufflers,\r\n    butter, and treacle.’ Her Majesty said they must have all these\r\n    things; and they did come out in abundance: Kullali got its\r\n    share of the gifts. But the very name of butter or treacle was\r\n    enough for the doctors: they said they would not allow it into\r\n    the wards, because it would be going about in bits of paper\r\n    and daubing everything. So Rev. Mother at once interposed, and\r\n    said if the doctors allowed it, she would have it distributed\r\n    in a way that could give no trouble. They apologized, and said\r\n    they should have known that, and at once left everything to\r\n    her. Each Sister got her portion of butter and treacle (which\r\n    were given only to the convalescent patients), and when the\r\n    bell rang every evening for tea she stood at the table in the\r\n    centre of the ward, and each soldier walked over and got his\r\n    bread buttered, and some treacle if he wished spread on like\r\n    jam. We told them it was a gift from the Queen; and if Her\r\n    Majesty could only have seen how gratified they were it would\r\n    have given her pleasure. One evening Lady Stratford, and some\r\n    distinguished guests who were staying at the Embassy, came,\r\n    and were much pleased to see how happy and comfortable the men\r\n    were, and how much they enjoyed Her Majesty’s gifts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n    _Letters from Scutari—Kinglake on Miss Nightingale and her\r\n    dynasty—The refusal of a new contingent._\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale’s saving sense of humour gleams forth in her letters\r\nin the most delightful way, even in the darkest days. In the following,\r\nsomething of the hugeness of her task is dimly seen through the comic\r\nbackground of the unbecoming cap that “If I’d known, ma’am, I wouldn’t\r\nhave come, ma’am.” Here is the letter just as it is given in Lord\r\nHerbert’s life. It begins abruptly, evidently quoting from a conversation\r\njust held with one of the staff nurses:—\r\n\r\n    “‘I came out, ma’am, prepared to submit to everything, to be\r\n    put upon in every way. But there are some things, ma’am, one\r\n    can’t submit to. There is the caps, ma’am, that suits one face\r\n    and some that suits another; and if I’d known, ma’am, about the\r\n    caps, great as was my desire to come out to nurse at Scutari,\r\n    I wouldn’t have come, ma’am.’—_Speech of Mrs. L., Barrack\r\n    Hospital, Scutari, Asiatic Side, November 14, 1854._\r\n\r\n    “Time must be at a discount with the man who can adjust the\r\n    balance of such an important question as the above, and I for\r\n    one have none, as you will easily suppose when I tell you that\r\n    on Thursday last we had 1,175 sick and wounded in this hospital\r\n    (among whom 120 cholera patients), and 650 severely wounded in\r\n    the other building, called the General Hospital, of which we\r\n    also have charge, when a message came to me to prepare for 510\r\n    wounded on our side of the hospital, who were arriving from the\r\n    dreadful affair of November 5, from Balaclava, in which battle\r\n    were 1,763 wounded and 442 killed, besides 96 officers wounded\r\n    and 38 killed. I always expected to end my days as a hospital\r\n    matron, but I never expected to be barrack mistress. We had but\r\n    half an hour’s notice before they began landing the wounded.\r\n    Between one and nine o’clock we had the mattresses stuffed,\r\n    sewn up, laid down (alas! only upon matting on the floor), the\r\n    men washed and put to bed, and all their wounds dressed.\r\n\r\n    “We are very lucky in our medical heads. Two of them are\r\n    brutes and four are angels—for this is a work which makes\r\n    either angels or devils of men, and of women too. As for\r\n    the assistants, they are all cubs, and will, while a man\r\n    is breathing his last breath under the knife, lament the\r\n    ‘annoyance of being called up from their dinners by such a\r\n    fresh influx of wounded.’ But unlicked cubs grow up into good\r\n    old bears, though I don’t know how; for certain it is, the old\r\n    bears are good. We have now four miles of beds and not eighteen\r\n    inches apart.\r\n\r\n    “We have our quarters in one tower of the barracks, and all\r\n    this fresh influx has been laid down between us and the main\r\n    guard, in two corridors, with a line of beds down each side,\r\n    just room for one person to pass between, and four wards. Yet\r\n    in the midst of this appalling horror (we are steeped up to our\r\n    necks in blood) there is good—and I can truly say, like St.\r\n    Peter, ‘It is good for us to be here’—though I doubt whether,\r\n    if St. Peter had been there, he would have said so.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile England, stirred to its depths by the accounts given by Mr.\r\nWilliam Howard Russell, of the sufferings of our soldiers, had begged the\r\n_Times_, in whose pages his letters appeared, to receive funds and send\r\nthem out by the hand of Mr. Macdonald, a man of vigour, firmness, and\r\ngood sense, and “loyally devoted to his duty.” Before leaving England,\r\nhe saw the Inspector-General of the army, Dr. Andrew Smith, and also the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, but was assured that Government had already provided\r\nso amply for the sick and wounded that his fund was not likely to be\r\nneeded. When he reached the Bosphorus all the official people there\r\ntalked to him in the same strain. But there leaked out through an officer\r\non duty one little fact that showed how much such assurances were worth.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that the 39th Regiment was actually on its way to the\r\nseverities of a Crimean winter with only the light summer clothing that\r\nwould be worn in hot countries. Happily, the surgeon of the regiment\r\nappealed to Mr. Macdonald, and, more happily still, Mr. Macdonald dared\r\nto go beyond his exact instructions and give help out of his fund which\r\nmight prevent illness, instead of waiting for the moment when death was\r\nalready at the door. He went into the markets of Constantinople and\r\nbought then and there a suit of flannels or other woollens for every man\r\nin that regiment.\r\n\r\nMr. Macdonald saw that he must be ready to offer help, or red tape and\r\nloyalty together would seal the lips of men in the service, lest they\r\nshould seem to be casting a slur on the army administration.\r\n\r\nThere is humour of the grimmest kind in what resulted. The chief of the\r\nScutari hospitals told him “nothing was wanted,” and on pushing his\r\ninquiry with a yet more distinguished personage, he was actually advised\r\nto spend the money on building a church at Pera!\r\n\r\n    “Yet at that very time,” says Kinglake, “wants so dire as\r\n    to include want of hospital furniture and of shirts for the\r\n    patients, and of the commonest means for obtaining cleanliness,\r\n    were afflicting our stricken soldiery in the hospitals.”\r\n\r\nThe Pera proposal—rightly described as “astounding”—led to an interview\r\nwith the Lady-in-Chief. Tears and laughter must have met in her heart\r\nas she heard this absurdity, and away she took him—money as well—to the\r\nvery centre of her commissariat, to see for himself the daily demands and\r\nthe gaping need—furniture, pillows, sheets, shirts—endless appliances\r\nand drugs—that need seemed truly endless, and many hours daily he spent\r\nwith her in the Nurses’ Tower, taking down lists of orders for the\r\nstorekeepers in Constantinople. Here was the right help at last—not\r\npretty mufflers for men in need of shirts, nor fine cambric for stout\r\nbed-linen.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the Lady-in-Chief Mr. Macdonald soon learned the truth,\r\nand the course he then took was one of the simplest kind, but it worked\r\na mighty change. He bought the things needed, and the authorities,\r\nsuccumbing at last to this excruciating form of demonstration, had to\r\nwitness the supply of wants which before they had refused to confess.\r\nSo now, besides using the stores which she had at her own command, the\r\nLady-in-Chief could impart wants felt in our hospitals to Mr. Macdonald\r\nwith the certainty that he would hasten to meet them by applying what was\r\ncalled the “_Times_ Fund” in purchasing the articles needed.\r\n\r\n    “It was thus,” adds Kinglake, “that under the sway of motives\r\n    superbly exalted, a great lady came to the rescue of our\r\n    prostrate soldiery, made good the default of the State, won the\r\n    gratitude, the rapt admiration of an enthusiastic people, and\r\n    earned for the name she bears a pure, a lasting renown.\r\n\r\n    “She even did more. By the very power of her fame, but also,\r\n    I believe, by the wisdom and the authority of her counsels,\r\n    she founded, if so one may speak, a gracious dynasty that\r\n    still reigns supreme in the wards where sufferers lie, and\r\n    even brings solace, brings guidance, brings hope, into those\r\n    dens of misery that, until the blessing has reached them, seem\r\n    only to harbour despair. When into the midst of such scenes\r\n    the young high-bred lady now glides, she wears that same\r\n    sacred armour—the gentle attire of the servitress—which seemed\r\n    ‘heavenly’ in the eyes of our soldiers at the time of the war,\r\n    and finds strength to meet her dire task, because she knows by\r\n    tradition what the first of the dynasty proved able to confront\r\n    and to vanquish in the wards of the great Barrack Hospital.”\r\n\r\nIn everything a woman’s hand and brain had been needed. It was, for\r\ninstance, of little use to receive in the evening, after barrack fires\r\nwere out, food which had been asked for from the supplies for some meal\r\nseveral hours earlier; yet that, it appears, was the sort of thing that\r\nhappened. And too much of the food officially provided, even when it did\r\nreach the patients at last, had been unfit for use.\r\n\r\nAs for the question of laundry, a washing contract that had only\r\nsucceeded in washing seven shirts for two or three thousand men could\r\nnot have been permitted to exist under any feminine management. Nor could\r\nany trained or knowledgeable nurse have allowed for a single day the\r\nwashing of infectious bed-linen in one common tub with the rest. Yet this\r\nhad been the condition of affairs before the Lady-in-Chief came on the\r\nscenes. In speaking of her work among the soldiers’ wives it has already\r\nbeen noted how she quickly hired and fitted up a house close to the\r\nhospital as a laundry, where under sanitary regulations 500 shirts and\r\n150 other articles were washed every week.\r\n\r\nThen there arose the practical question of what could be done for the\r\npoor fellows who had no clothes at all except the grimy and blood-stained\r\ngarments in which they arrived, and we are told that in the first three\r\nmonths, out of her own private funds, she provided the men with ten\r\nthousand shirts.\r\n\r\nThe drugs had all been in such confusion that once when Mrs. Bracebridge\r\nhad asked three times for chloride of lime and been assured that there\r\nwas none, Miss Nightingale insisted on a thorough search, and not less\r\nthan ninety pounds of it were discovered.\r\n\r\nThe semi-starvation of many hospital patients before Miss Nightingale’s\r\narrival, noted on an earlier page, was chiefly the result of\r\nmismanagement—mismanagement on the part of those who meant well—often,\r\nindeed, meant the very best within their power, but among whom there\r\nwas, until her coming, no central directing power, with brain and heart\r\nalike capable and energizing and alive to all the vital needs of deathly\r\nillness—alert with large foreseeing outlook, yet shrewd and swift in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nIt is at first puzzling to compare Kinglake’s picture of the confusion\r\nand suffering, even while he is defending Lord Raglan, with some of\r\nthe letters in Lord Stanmore’s “Life of Lord Herbert,” especially one\r\nfrom General Estcourt, in which he says “never was an army better fed.”\r\nBut even in this letter—dated, be it noted, a fortnight after Miss\r\nNightingale’s arrival—the next sentence, which refers, of course, to the\r\narmy in general and not to the hospitals under her management, shows the\r\nsame muddling that had pursued the hospitals until she came to their\r\naid with Mr. Herbert and the War Office at her back; for after saying\r\nthat the ration is ample and most liberal, it adds—and the italics are\r\nmine—“_but the men cannot cook for want of camp-kettles and for want of\r\nfuel_.”\r\n\r\nYet even with regard to the hospitals, it is startling to find Mr.\r\nBracebridge, in his first letter to Mr. Herbert, speaking of the Barrack\r\nHospital as clean and airy. But people have such odd ideas of what is\r\n“clean and airy,” and it would seem that he thought it “clean and airy”\r\nfor the patients to have no proper arrangements for washing, for the\r\ndrains to be in such a noisome state as to need engineering, and for six\r\ndead dogs to be rotting under the windows! I suppose he liked the look\r\nof the walls and the height of the ceilings, and wanted, moreover, to\r\ncomfort Mr. Herbert’s sad heart at a time when all England was up in arms\r\nat the mistakes made in transport and other arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe letters of the chaplain to Mr. Herbert are full of interest, and\r\nin reading the following we have to put ourselves back into the mind\r\nof a time that looked anxiously to see whether Miss Nightingale was\r\nreally equal to her task—an idea which to us of to-day seems foolish and\r\ntimorous, but which was, after all, quite natural, seeing that she was\r\nnew and untried in this particular venture of army nursing, and that half\r\nthe onlookers had no idea of the long and varied training she had had.\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR HERBERT,—I have now had near a week’s opportunity of\r\n    closely observing the details of the hospitals at Scutari.\r\n    First, as to Miss Nightingale and her company, nothing can be\r\n    said too strong in their praise; she works them wonderfully,\r\n    and they are so useful that I have no hesitation in saying some\r\n    twenty more of the same sort would be a very great blessing\r\n    to the establishment. Her nerve is equal to her good sense;\r\n    she, with one of her nurses and myself, gave efficient aid at\r\n    an amputation of the thigh yesterday. She was just as cool\r\n    as if she had had to do it herself. We are close allies, and\r\n    through Macdonald and the funds at my own command, I get her\r\n    everything for which she asks, and this is saying a great deal.\r\n\r\n    “My honest view of the matter is this: I found but too great\r\n    evidence of the staff and means being unequal to the emergency;\r\n    the requirements have almost doubled through the last two\r\n    unhappy actions at Balaclava. Still, day by day I see manifest\r\n    improvement; no government, no nation could have provided, on\r\n    a sudden, staff and appliances for accident wards miles in\r\n    length, and for such sickness as that horrid Varna dysentery.\r\n    To manage more than three thousand casualties of the worst\r\n    nature is indeed a task to be met in an entirely satisfactory\r\n    way by nothing short of a miraculous energy with the means\r\n    it would require. The men are landed necessarily in a most\r\n    pitiable state, and have to be carried up steep ground for\r\n    considerable distance, either by those beasts of Turks, who are\r\n    as stupid as callous, or by our invalids, who are not equal to\r\n    the task. Still, it is done, and as this is war, not peace, and\r\n    Scutari is really a battlefield, I am more disposed to lament\r\n    than to blame.\r\n\r\n    “There seems now, so far as I can see, no lack of lint and\r\n    plaister; there is a lack of linen,—we have sent home for it.\r\n    The surgeons are working their utmost, and serious cases seem\r\n    treated with great humanity and skill. There was and is an\r\n    awful want of shirts for the men, and socks, and such matters;\r\n    we have already let Miss Nightingale have all she applies for,\r\n    and this morning I, with Macdonald’s sanction, or, rather, in\r\n    concert with him, have sent to the Crimea a large stock of\r\n    shirts of warm serge, socks, flannel, tea, etc., etc. I spend\r\n    the best part of every day there acting, at one time as priest\r\n    to the dying, at another helping the surgeons or the men to\r\n    dress their wounds; again, I go to the landing-place and try\r\n    to work them into method for an hour or two, etc., etc. One\r\n    and all are now most kind and civil to me, meet my wishes in\r\n    every way they can. Alas! I fear, with every possible effort\r\n    of the existing establishment, the crisis is still too great;\r\n    there are wanting hundreds of beds—that is, many hundreds have\r\n    only matting between the beds and the stone floor. I slept\r\n    here Sunday night, and walked the wards late and early in\r\n    the morning; I fear the cold weather in these passages will\r\n    produce on men so crippled and so maimed much supplementary\r\n    evil in the way of coughs and chest diseases. The wounded do\r\n    better than the sick. I scarce pray with one of the latter one\r\n    day but I hear he is dead on the morrow.... I am glad to say\r\n    the authorities have left off swearing they had everything\r\n    and wanted nothing; they are now grateful for the help which,\r\n    with the fund at command, we liberally meet. The wounds are,\r\n    many of them, of the most fearful character, and yet I have\r\n    not heard a murmur, even from those who, from the pressing\r\n    urgency of the case, are often left with most obvious grounds\r\n    of complaint. Stafford O’Brien is here; he, at my suggestion,\r\n    aids my son and self in letter writing for the poor creatures.\r\n    My room is a post office; I pay the post of every letter from\r\n    every hospital patient, and we write masses every day. They\r\n    show one what the British soldier really is; I only wish to God\r\n    the people of England, who regard the red coat as a mere guise\r\n    of a roystering rake in the private and a dandified exclusive\r\n    in the officer, could see the patience, true modesty, and\r\n    courageous endurance of all ranks.\r\n\r\n    “Understand me clearly. I could pick many a hole; I could\r\n    show where head has been wanting, truth perverted, duty\r\n    neglected, etc.; but I feel that the pressure was such and of\r\n    so frightful, so severe (in one way) a character, there is such\r\n    an effort at what we desire, that I for one cry out of the past\r\n    ‘_non mi ricordo_;’ of the present, ‘If the cart is in the\r\n    rut, there is every shoulder at the wheel.’ The things wanted\r\n    we cannot wait for you to supply, in England; if the slaughter\r\n    is to go on as it has done the last fortnight, the need must\r\n    be met at once. Macdonald is doing his work most sensibly,\r\n    steadily, and I believe not only with no offence to any, but is\r\n    earning the goodwill of all.”\r\n\r\nTruth is a two-edged sword, and for purposes of rebuke or reform Miss\r\nNightingale used it at times with keenness and daring. In that sense this\r\nglowing, loving-hearted woman knew how on occasions to be stern. Her\r\nsalt never lost its savour. She was swift, efficient, capable to the\r\nlast degree, and she was also high-spirited and sometimes sharp-tongued.\r\nPerhaps we love her all the more for being so human. A person outwardly\r\nall perfection, if not altogether divine, is apt to give the idea\r\nthat there are faults hidden up somewhere. It was not so with Miss\r\nNightingale. Her determination to carry at all costs the purpose she had\r\nin hand laid her often open to criticism, for, just as she was ready on\r\noccasion to override her own feelings, so also she was ready sometimes to\r\noverride the feelings of others. Mr. Herbert judged from her letters that\r\nan addition to her staff of nurses would be welcome, but we saw that when\r\nthe new band of forty-six arrived, under the escort of Miss Nightingale’s\r\nold friend Miss Stanley, they were not admitted to the hospital at\r\nScutari, and to tell the truth, Miss Nightingale was very angry at their\r\nbeing thrust upon her, just when she was finding her own staff rather a\r\n“handful.” In point of fact, she not only wrote a very warm letter to her\r\nold friend Mr. Herbert, but she also formally gave in her resignation.\r\n\r\nThis was not accepted. Mr. Herbert’s generous sweetness of nature, his\r\nlove for the writer, and his belief that she was the one person needed\r\nin the hospitals, and was doing wonders there, led him to write a very\r\nnoble and humble reply, saying that _he_ had made a mistake—which,\r\nindeed, was true enough—in taking his well-meant step without consulting\r\nher. She yielded her point in so far as to remain at her post, now that\r\nMiss Stanley and her staff had moved on to Therapia and Smyrna, and were\r\ndoing real good there, Miss Stanley having given up all her own plans, to\r\nremain and look after the nurses who had come under her escort.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from the fact that it would have been a great hindrance to\r\ndiscipline to have forty-six women on her hands who had _not_ promised\r\nobedience to her, as had her own nurses, a little sidelight is thrown\r\nupon it all by these words in one of Miss Stanley’s own letters, speaking\r\nof the nurses under her guardianship:—\r\n\r\n    “The first night there was great dissatisfaction among them,\r\n    and a strong inclination to strike work. ‘We are not come out\r\n    to be cooks, housemaids, and washerwomen,’ and they dwelt\r\n    considerably on Mr. Herbert’s words about equality. _They are\r\n    like troublesome children._”\r\n\r\nThough our sympathy goes out to Miss Stanley, it is not impossible that\r\nMiss Nightingale’s decision may have saved Scutari from unavoidable\r\nconfusions of authority which would have been very unseemly, and from\r\nmore than a possibility of defeat in the experiment she was making, in\r\nthe eyes of all Europe, as to how far women could be wisely admitted\r\ninto military hospitals. Such confusion might have arisen, not from any\r\nfault in Miss Nightingale or Miss Stanley, but from the special work of\r\nreorganization which had to be done at Scutari, and the special code of\r\nobedience by which Miss Nightingale’s staff had been prepared for it. She\r\ndid not want for such work any “troublesome children.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n    _The busy nursing hive—M. Soyer and his memories—Miss\r\n    Nightingale’s complete triumph over prejudice—The memories of\r\n    Sister Aloysius._\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Miss Stanley’s letters give us a very interesting informal\r\nglimpse of the work that was going on and of Miss Nightingale herself.\r\nHere is one in which she describes her visit to her in the hospital at\r\nScutari:—\r\n\r\n    “We passed down two or three of these immense corridors, asking\r\n    our way as we went. At last we came to the guard-room, another\r\n    corridor, then through a door into a large, busy kitchen, where\r\n    stood Mrs. Margaret Williams, who seemed much pleased to see\r\n    me: then a heavy curtain was raised; I went through a door, and\r\n    there sat dear Flo writing on a small unpainted deal table. I\r\n    never saw her looking better. She had on her black merino,\r\n    trimmed with black velvet, clean linen collar and cuffs, apron,\r\n    white cap with a black handkerchief tied over it; and there was\r\n    Mrs. Bracebridge, looking so nice, too. I was quite satisfied\r\n    with my welcome. It was settled at once that I was to sleep\r\n    here, especially as, being post day, Flo could not attend to me\r\n    till the afternoon.\r\n\r\n    “The sofa is covered with newspapers just come in by the post.\r\n    I have been sitting for an hour here, having some coffee, and\r\n    writing, Mrs. Clarke coming in to see what I have wanted, in\r\n    spite of what I could say.\r\n\r\n    “The work this morning was the sending off General Adams’s\r\n    remains, and the arrangements consequent upon it.\r\n\r\n    “A stream of people every minute.\r\n\r\n    “‘Please, ma’am, have you any black-edged paper?’\r\n\r\n    “‘Please, what can I give which would keep on his stomach; is\r\n    there any arrowroot to-day for him?’\r\n\r\n    “‘No; the tubs of arrowroot must be for the worst cases; we\r\n    cannot spare him any, nor is there any jelly to-day; try him\r\n    with some eggs, etc.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Please, Mr. Gordon wishes to see Miss Nightingale about the\r\n    orders she gave him.’\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Sabine comes in for something else.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Bracebridge in and out about General Adams, and orders of\r\n    various kinds.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the busy life of which Miss Nightingale was the queen, though,\r\nunlike the queen-bee of the ordinary honey-hive, this queen of nurses was\r\nthe hardest-worked and most severely strained worker in the whole toiling\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nIt was early in the spring of 1855 that in the feeding department, which\r\nshe rightly considered of great importance to her invalids, she received\r\nunexpected help.\r\n\r\nThis came from M. Soyer, who may be remembered by more than one old\r\nLondoner as at one time _chef_ of the New Reform Club, where his\r\nbiography, which contains some interesting illustrations, still adorns\r\nthe library. M. Soyer begged to be allowed the command of the hospital\r\nkitchen at Scutari. He was an expert and an enthusiast, and very amusing.\r\n\r\nAlso what he offered was of no slight importance and unselfishness. In\r\nFebruary, 1855, he wrote as follows to the _Times_:—\r\n\r\n    “Sir,—After carefully perusing the letter of your\r\n    correspondent, dated Scutari, in your impression of Wednesday\r\n    last, I perceive that, although the kitchen under the\r\n    superintendence of Miss Nightingale affords so much relief,\r\n    the system of management at the large one at the Barrack\r\n    Hospital is far from being perfect. I propose offering my\r\n    services gratuitously, and proceeding direct to Scutari at my\r\n    own personal expense, to regulate that important department,\r\n    if the Government will honour me with their confidence, and\r\n    grant me the full power of acting according to my knowledge and\r\n    experience in such matters.—I have the honour to remain, sir,\r\n    your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                       “A. SOYER.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis proposal was accepted, and on his arrival at Scutari he was welcomed\r\nby Miss Nightingale in what he names, after his rather florid manner, “a\r\nsanctuary of benevolence.” There he presented his letters and parcels\r\nfrom the Duchess of Sutherland and Mr. Stafford and others, the Duchess\r\nespecially commending him to the Lady-in-Chief as likely to be of service\r\nin the cooking department. He was found to be a most valuable ally, and\r\nhis letters and writings, since published, are full of interest. He\r\nwrote home at once, saying: “I must especially express my gratitude to\r\nMiss Nightingale, who from her extraordinary intelligence and the good\r\norganization of her kitchen procured me every material for making a\r\ncommencement, and thus saved me at least one week’s sheer loss of time,\r\nas my model kitchen did not arrive till Saturday last.”\r\n\r\nThis is interesting, because it shows yet once more Miss Nightingale’s\r\nthoroughness and foresight and attention to detail—the more valuable in\r\none whose outlook at the same time touched so wide a skyline, and was so\r\nlarge in its noble care for a far-off future and a world of many nations,\r\nnever bounded by her own small island or her own church pew.\r\n\r\nSoyer’s description of her is worth giving in full, and later we shall,\r\nthrough his eyes, have a vision of her as she rode to Balaclava.\r\n\r\n    “Her visage as regards expression is very remarkable, and one\r\n    can almost anticipate by her countenance what she is about to\r\n    say: alternately, with matters of the most grave importance,\r\n    a gentle smile passes radiantly over her countenance, thus\r\n    proving her evenness of temper; at other times, when wit or\r\n    a pleasantry prevails, the heroine is lost in the happy,\r\n    good-natured smile which pervades her face, and you recognize\r\n    only the charming woman. Her dress is generally of a greyish\r\n    or black tint; she wears a simple white cap, and often a rough\r\n    apron. In a word, her whole appearance is religiously simple\r\n    and unsophisticated. In conversation no member of the fair sex\r\n    can be more amiable and gentle than Miss Nightingale. Removed\r\n    from her arduous and cavalier-like duties, which require the\r\n    nerve of a Hercules—and she possesses it when required—she is\r\n    Rachel on the stage in both tragedy and comedy.”\r\n\r\nSoyer’s help and loyalty proved invaluable all through the campaign. His\r\nvolume of memories adds a vivid bit of colour here and there to these\r\npages. His own life had been romantic, and he saw everything from the\r\nromantic point of view.\r\n\r\nWe read and know that although Sidney Herbert’s letter to Dr. Menzies,\r\nthe principal medical officer at Scutari, asked that all regard should be\r\npaid to every wish of the Lady-in-Chief, and that was in itself a great\r\nmeans of power, the greatest power of all lay in her own personality and\r\nits compelling magnetism, which drew others to obedience. The attractive\r\nforce of a strong, clear, comprehensive mind, and still more of a soul on\r\nfire with high purpose and deep compassion, which never wasted themselves\r\nin words, became tenfold the more powerful for the restraint and\r\nself-discipline which held all boisterous expression of them in check—her\r\nword, her very glance,\r\n\r\n    “Winning its way with extreme gentleness\r\n    Through all the outworks of suspicious pride.”\r\n\r\nHer strength was to be tried to the uttermost; for scarcely had her work\r\nin the hospital begun when cholera came stalking over the threshold. Day\r\nand night among the dying and the dead she and her nurses toiled with\r\nfearless devotion, each one carrying her life in her hand, but seldom,\r\nindeed, even thinking of that in the heroic struggle to save as many\r\nother lives as possible.\r\n\r\nMiss Nightingale long afterwards, when talking of services of a far\r\neasier kind, once said to a professional friend that no one was fit to be\r\na nurse who did not really enjoy precisely those duties of a sick-room\r\nwhich the ordinary uneducated woman counts revolting; and if she was, at\r\nthis time, now and then impatient with stupidity and incompetence and\r\ncarelessness, that is not wonderful in one whose effort was always at\r\nhigh level, and for whom every detail was of vivid interest, because she\r\nrealized that often on exactitude in details hung the balance between\r\nlife and death.\r\n\r\nOn their first arrival she and her nurses may, no doubt, have had to bear\r\ncold-shouldering and jealousy; but in the long agony of the cholera\r\nvisitation they were welcomed as veritable angels of light. It would\r\nbe easy to be sensational in describing the scenes amid which they\r\nmoved, for before long the hospital was filled, day and night, with two\r\nlong processions: on one side came in those who carried the sick men\r\nin on their stretchers, and on the other side those who carried out\r\nthe dead. The orderlies could not have been trusted to do the nursing\r\nthat was required; the “stuping”—a professional method of wholesale hot\r\nfomentations and rubbings to release the iron rigidity of the cholera\r\npatient’s body—was best done by skilled and gentle hands, and even in\r\n_such_ hands, so bad were the surrounding conditions—the crowding, the\r\nbad drainage, the impure water—that, despite the utmost devotion, only a\r\nsmall proportion of lives could be saved.\r\n\r\nIt was especially at this time that the feeling towards the Lady-in-Chief\r\ndeepened into a trust that was almost worship. Watchful, resourceful,\r\nunconquered, with a mind that, missing no detail, yet took account of\r\nthe widest issues and the farthest ends, she was yet full of divine\r\ntenderness for each sufferer whom with her own hands she tended; and,\r\nalthough she did not nurse the officers—she left that to others—in her\r\ndevotion to Tommy Atkins she had been known to be on her feet, as already\r\nhas been said, for twenty hours on end; and, whether she was kneeling or\r\nstanding, stooping or lifting, always an ideal nurse.\r\n\r\nThe graves round the hospitals were not dug deep enough, and the air\r\nbecame even fouler than before. To the inroads of cholera the suffering\r\nof Sebastopol patients added a new form of death. Sister Aloysius writes\r\nof these men who came in by scores and hundreds from the trenches, and\r\nwhom this Sister, greatly valued by the Lady-in-Chief, helped to nurse\r\nboth at Scutari and at Balaclava:—\r\n\r\n    “I must say something of my poor frost-bitten patients. The men\r\n    who came from the ‘front,’ as they called it, had only thin\r\n    linen suits, no other clothing to keep out the Crimean frost\r\n    of 1854-5. When they were carried in on the stretchers which\r\n    conveyed so many to their last resting-place, their clothes\r\n    had to be cut off. In most cases the flesh and clothes were\r\n    frozen together; and, as for the feet, the boots had to be cut\r\n    off bit by bit, the flesh coming off with them; many pieces of\r\n    the flesh I have seen remain in the boot.\r\n\r\n    “We have just received some hundreds of poor creatures, worn\r\n    out with sufferings beyond any you could imagine, in the\r\n    Crimea, where the cold is so intense that a soldier described\r\n    to me the Russians and the Allies in a sudden skirmish, and\r\n    neither party able to draw a trigger! So fancy what the poor\r\n    soldiers must endure in the ‘trenches.’\r\n\r\n    “It was a comfort to think that these brave men had some care,\r\n    all that we could procure for them. For at this time the food\r\n    was very bad—goat’s flesh, and sometimes what they called\r\n    mutton, but black, blue, and green. Yet who could complain of\r\n    anything after the sufferings I have faintly described—borne,\r\n    too, with such patience: not a murmur!... One day, after a\r\n    batch had arrived from the Crimea, and I had gone my rounds\r\n    through them, one of my orderlies told me that a man wanted to\r\n    speak one word to me.\r\n\r\n    “When I had a moment I went to him. ‘Tell me at once what you\r\n    want; I have worse cases to see after’—he did not happen to be\r\n    very bad. ‘All I want to know, ma’am, is, are you one of our\r\n    own Sisters of Mercy from Ireland?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘your very\r\n    own.’ ‘God be praised for that!’\r\n\r\n    “Another poor fellow said to me one day, ‘Do they give you\r\n    anything good out here?’ ‘Oh yes,’ I said; ‘why do you ask me?’\r\n    ‘Because, ma’am, you gave me a piece of chicken for my dinner,\r\n    and I kept some of it for you.’ He pulled it out from under his\r\n    head and offered it to me. I declined the favour with thanks. I\r\n    never could say enough of those kind-hearted soldiers and their\r\n    consideration for us in the midst of their sufferings.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n    _Inexactitudes—Labels—Cholera—“The Lady with the Lamp”—Her\r\n    humour—Letters of Sister Aloysius._\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of December Miss Nightingale had to rebuke very severely\r\none of her own nurses, who had written a letter to the _Times_ which made\r\na great sensation by its lurid picture of the evils in the hospital—a\r\nmisrepresentation so great that the nurse herself confessed in the end\r\nthat it was “a tissue of exaggerations”—perhaps “inexactitudes” would be\r\nour modern word.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the small-minded parochial gossips at home were wasting\r\ntheir time in discussing Miss Nightingale’s religious opinions. One who\r\nworked so happily with all who served the same Master was first accused\r\nunder the old cry of “Popery,” and then under the equally silly label\r\nof “Unitarianism.” Her friend Mrs. Herbert, in rebuking parish gossip,\r\nfelt it necessary to unpin these two labels and loyally pin on a new one,\r\nby explaining that in reality she was rather “Low Church.” The really\r\nsensible person, with whom, doubtless, Lady Herbert would have fully\r\nagreed, was the Irish parson, and his like, when he replied to some\r\nfoolish questions about her that Miss Nightingale belonged to a very rare\r\nsect indeed—the sect of the Good Samaritans.\r\n\r\nMiss Stanley tells a most amusing story of how one of the military\r\nchaplains complained to Miss Jebbut that very improper books had been\r\ncirculated in the wards; she pressed in vain to know what they were. “As\r\nI was coming away he begged for five minutes’ conversation, said he was\r\nanswerable for the men and what they read, and he must protest against\r\nsentiments he neither approved nor understood, and that he would fetch me\r\nthe book. It was Keble’s ‘Christian Year,’ which Miss Jebbut had lent to\r\na sick midshipman!”\r\n\r\nIt was a brave heart indeed that the Good Samaritan needed now, with\r\ncholera added to the other horrors of hospital suffering, and the\r\nfrost-bitten cases from Sebastopol were almost equally heart-rending.\r\n\r\nIt was early in January 1855 that Miss Stanley escorted fifty more\r\nnurses. Most of them worked under Miss Anderson at the General Hospital\r\nat Scutari, but eight were sent into the midst of the fighting at\r\nBalaclava, and of the life there “at the front” the letters of Sister\r\nAloysius give a terrible picture. We have, for instance, the story of a\r\nman ill and frost-bitten, who found he could not turn on his side because\r\nhis feet were frozen to those of the soldier opposite. And it came to\r\npass that for two months the death-rate in the hospitals was sixty per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nNight after night, the restless, lonely sufferers watched for the coming\r\nof the slender, white-capped figure with the little light that she shaded\r\nso carefully lest it should waken any sleeper, as she passed through the\r\nlong corridors watching over the welfare of her patients, and to them she\r\nwas “the Lady with the Lamp.”\r\n\r\nWe still see with the American poet:—\r\n\r\n    “The wounded from the battle-plain,\r\n    In dreary hospitals of pain,\r\n      The cheerless corridors,\r\n      The cold and stony floors.\r\n\r\n    “Lo! in that house of misery\r\n    A lady with a lamp I see\r\n      Pass through the glimmering gloom,\r\n      And flit from room to room.\r\n\r\n    “And slow, as in a dream of bliss,\r\n    The speechless sufferer turns to kiss\r\n      Her shadow, as it falls\r\n      Upon the darkening walls.”\r\n\r\n“Ah,” said to me old John Ball, the veteran of the Crimea, who had been\r\nwounded at Alma and been at Scutari a month before her arrival, so that\r\nin his later days there he saw the changes that she wrought, “ah, she was\r\na _good_ soul—she was a _good_ woman!” And through his words, and those\r\nof the other old men who remembered her, it was possible to discern a\r\nlittle of the glow, the humour, the homely maternal tenderness with which\r\nthe _Wohlgebohrene Dame_ had comforted young and old in their hours of\r\npatriotic wounding and pain.\r\n\r\nFor herself, in the long days of sacrificial service, was there any\r\nhuman solace, any dear companionship, any dawning light of love?\r\n\r\nFor us at least, the mere outsiders, to whom she is just a very practical\r\nsaint and a very great woman, “there lives no record of reply.” But we\r\nknow that, though hers was the solitary path, which yet was no solitude\r\nbecause of the outpoured love and sympathy to others, when in her\r\npresence once some one was chattering about the advantages of “single\r\nblessedness,” she, with her quick sense of humour, replied that a fish\r\nout of water might be blessed, but a good deal of effort was needed to\r\nbecome accustomed to the air!\r\n\r\nNone of the letters describing the Scutari life are more interesting than\r\nthose of Sister Aloysius, the Irish Sister of Mercy, from whose graphic\r\ndescriptions quotations have already been made.\r\n\r\n    “She and her companions had had only a few hours in which to\r\n    prepare for a long and dangerous journey, with the details of\r\n    which they were quite unacquainted, only knowing that they were\r\n    to start for Turkey at half-past seven in the morning, and\r\n    that they went for the love of God.\r\n\r\n    “‘And who is to take care of you from this to Turkey?’ asked\r\n    one of their amazed well-wishers. To which the Sisters only\r\n    replied that ‘they hoped their guardian angels would kindly do\r\n    so.’”\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the little party _did_ reach its destination safely,\r\nand “at last,” writes Sister Aloysius, “a despatch came[14] to say that\r\nfive Sisters were to proceed to Scutari, to the General Hospital; while\r\narrangements were made for the other ten Sisters to proceed to a house on\r\nthe Bosphorus, to await further orders. At once the five Sisters started\r\nfor Scutari: Reverend Mother, Sister M. Agnes, Sister M. Elizabeth,\r\nSister M. Winifred, and myself. When we reached Scutari we were shown\r\nto our quarters consisting of one little room, not in a very agreeable\r\nlocality. However, we were quite satisfied none better could be found,\r\nand for this little nook we were thankful.\r\n\r\n“Of course, we expected to be sent to the wards at once. Sister M. Agnes\r\nand the writer were sent to a store to sort clothes that had been eaten\r\nby the rats; Rev. Mother and Sister M. Elizabeth either to the kitchen or\r\nto another store. In a dark, damp, gloomy shed we set to work and did the\r\nbest we could; but, indeed, the destruction accomplished by the rats was\r\nsomething wonderful. On the woollen goods they had feasted sumptuously.\r\nThey were running about us in all directions; we begged of the sergeant\r\nto leave the door open that we might make our escape if they attacked us.\r\nOur home rats would run if you ‘hushed’ them; but you might ‘hush’ away,\r\nand the Scutari rats would not take the least notice.\r\n\r\n“During my stay in the stores I saw numberless funerals pass by the\r\nwindow. Cholera was raging, and how I did wish to be in the wards amongst\r\nthe poor dying soldiers! Before I leave the stores I must mention that\r\nSister M. Agnes and myself thought the English nobility must have emptied\r\ntheir wardrobes and linen stores to send out bandages for the wounded—the\r\nmost beautiful underclothing, the finest cambric sheets, with merely a\r\nscissors run here and there through them to ensure their being used\r\nfor no other purpose. And such large bales, too; some from the Queen’s\r\nPalace, with the Royal monogram beautifully worked. Whoever sent out\r\nthese immense bales thought nothing too good for the poor soldiers. And\r\nthey were right—nothing was too good for them. And now good-bye stores\r\nand good-bye rats; for I was to be in the cholera wards in the morning.\r\n\r\n“Where shall I begin, or how can I ever describe my first day in the\r\nhospital at Scutari? Vessels were arriving, and the orderlies carrying\r\nthe poor fellows, who, with their wounds and frost-bites, had been\r\ntossing about on the Black Sea for two or three days, and sometimes more.\r\nWhere were they to go? Not an available bed. They were laid on the floor\r\none after another, till the beds were emptied of those dying of cholera\r\nand every other disease. Many died immediately after being brought\r\nin—their moans would pierce the heart—the taking of them in and out of\r\nthe vessels must have increased their pain.\r\n\r\n“The look of agony in those poor dying faces will never leave my heart.\r\n\r\n“Week in, week out, the cholera went on. The same remedies were\r\ncontinued, though almost always to fail. However, while there was life\r\nthere was hope, and we kept on the warm applications to the last. When it\r\ncame near the end the patients got into a sort of collapse, out of which\r\nthey did not rally.\r\n\r\n“We begged the orderlies, waiting to take them to the dead-house, to\r\nwait a little lest they might not be dead; and with great difficulty we\r\nprevailed on them to make the least delay. As a rule the orderlies drank\r\nfreely—‘to drown their grief,’ they said. I must say that their position\r\nwas a very hard one—their work always increasing—and such work; death\r\naround them on every side; their own lives in continual danger—it was\r\nalmost for them a continuation of the field of battle.\r\n\r\n“The poor wounded men brought in out of the vessels were in a dreadful\r\nstate of dirt, and so weak that whatever cleaning they got had to\r\nbe done cautiously. Oh, the state of those fine fellows, so worn\r\nout with fatigue, so full of vermin! Most, or all, of them required\r\nspoon-feeding. We had wine, sago, arrowroot. Indeed, I think there was\r\neverything in the stores, but it was so hard to get them.... An orderly\r\nofficer took the rounds of the wards every night to see that all was\r\nright. He was expected by the orderlies, and the moment he raised the\r\nlatch one cried out, ‘All right, your honour.’ Many a time I said, ‘All\r\nwrong.’ The poor officer, of course, went his way; and one could scarcely\r\nblame him for not entering those wards, so filled with pestilence, the\r\nair so dreadful that to breathe it might cost him his life. And then,\r\nwhat could he do even if he did come? I remember one day an officer’s\r\norderly being brought in—a dreadful case of cholera; and so devoted was\r\nhis master that he came in every half-hour to see him, and stood over him\r\nin the bed as if it was only a cold he had; the poor fellow died after a\r\nfew hours’ illness. I hope his devoted master escaped. I never heard.\r\n\r\n“Each Sister had charge of two wards, and there was just at this time\r\na fresh outbreak of cholera. The Sisters were up every night; and the\r\ncases, as in Scutari and Kullali, were nearly all fatal. Reverend Mother\r\ndid not allow the Sisters to remain up all night, except in cases of\r\ncholera, without a written order from the doctor.\r\n\r\n“In passing to the wards at night we used to meet the rats in droves.\r\nThey would not even move out of our way. They were there before us, and\r\nwere determined to keep possession. As for our hut, they evidently wanted\r\nto make it theirs, scraping under the boards, jumping up on the shelf\r\nwhere our little tin utensils were kept, rattling everything. One night\r\ndear Sister M. Paula found one licking her forehead—she had a real horror\r\nof them. Sleep was out of the question. Our third day in Balaclava was a\r\nvery sad one for us. One of our dear band, Sister Winifred, got very ill\r\nduring the night with cholera. She was a most angelic Sister, and we were\r\nall deeply grieved.\r\n\r\n“She, the first to go of all our little band, had been full of life and\r\nenergy the day before. We were all very sad, and we wondered who would be\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n“Miss Nightingale was at the funeral, and even joined in the prayers.\r\nThe soldiers, doctors, officers, and officials followed. When all was\r\nover we returned to our hut, very sad; but we had no further time to\r\nthink. Patients were pouring in, and we should be out again to the\r\ncholera wards. Besides cholera there were cases of fever—in fact, of\r\nevery disease. Others had been nearly killed by the blasting of rocks,\r\nand they came in fearfully disfigured.\r\n\r\n“Father Woolett brought us one day a present of a Russian cat; he bought\r\nit, he told us, from an old Russian woman for the small sum of seven\r\nshillings. It made a particularly handsome captive in the land of its\r\nfathers, for we were obliged to keep it tied to a chair to prevent its\r\nescape. But the very sight of this powerful champion soon relieved us of\r\nsome of our unwelcome and voracious visitors.\r\n\r\n“Early in 1856 rumours of peace reached us from all sides. But our\r\nHeavenly Father demanded another sacrifice from our devoted little band.\r\nDear Sister Mary Elizabeth was called to a martyrs’ crown.\r\n\r\n“She was specially beloved for her extraordinary sweetness of\r\ndisposition. The doctor, when called, pronounced her illness to be fever;\r\nshe had caught typhus in her ward. Every loving care was bestowed on her\r\nby our dearest Mother, who scarcely ever left her bedside. Death seemed\r\nto have no sting.... She had no wish to live or die, feeling she was in\r\nthe arms of her Heavenly Father. ‘He will do for me what is best,’ she\r\nwhispered, ‘and His will is all I desire.’”\r\n\r\nAt Scutari Miss Nightingale’s work of reorganization was bearing swift\r\nfruit. The wives of the soldiers were daily employed in the laundry she\r\nhad established, so that they had a decent livelihood, and the soldiers\r\nthemselves had clean linen. But, of course, a great many of the soldiers\r\nhad left their wives and children at home.\r\n\r\nA money office also had been formed by the Lady-in-Chief, which helped\r\nthem in sending home their pay. It was she too who arranged for the safe\r\nreturn of the widows to England, and it was she who provided stamps\r\nand stationery for the men, that they might be able to write to those\r\ndear to them. No one had had a moment, it seemed, to give thought to\r\nanything but the actual warfare with all its horrors, until her womanly\r\nsympathy and splendid capacity came on the scene. With her there was\r\nalways little time lost between planning and achieving, and happily she\r\nhad power of every kind in her hand. Besides her own means, which she\r\npoured forth like water, the people of England had, as we saw, subscribed\r\nmagnificently through the _Times_ Fund, and with one so practical as the\r\nLady-in-Chief in daily consultation with Mr. Macdonald, there was no\r\nlonger any fear of giving to church walls what was intended to save the\r\nlives of ill-clad and dying soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Nightingale visits Balaclava—Her illness—Lord Raglan’s\r\n    visit—The Fall of Sebastopol._\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last, in the May of 1855, the Lady-in-Chief was able to see such\r\nfruits of the six months’ steady work at Scutari that the scene of her\r\nlabours could be changed, and she set out for Balaclava to inspect the\r\nother hospitals, for which, as superintendent of the ladies in the\r\nmilitary hospitals in the East, she was responsible. She wished to see\r\nfor herself what was being done for the soldiers on the field. Besides\r\nMr. Bracebridge and her nursing staff, M. Soyer accompanied her with a\r\nview to improving the cooking arrangements for the army in the field, and\r\nhe writes with his usual vividness:—\r\n\r\n    “Thomas, Miss Nightingale’s boy, the twelve-year-old drummer\r\n    who had left what he called his ‘instrument sticks’ to make\r\n    himself her most devoted slave and messenger, was also allowed\r\n    to go.\r\n\r\n    “At nine,” says M. Soyer, “we were all on shore and mounted.\r\n    There were about eight of us ready to escort our heroine to the\r\n    seat of war. Miss Nightingale was attired simply in a genteel\r\n    amazone, or riding habit, and had quite a martial air. She was\r\n    mounted upon a very pretty mare of a golden colour which, by\r\n    its gambols and caracoling, seemed proud to carry its noble\r\n    charge. The weather was very fine. Our cavalcade produced an\r\n    extraordinary effect upon the motley crowd of all nations\r\n    assembled at Balaclava, who were astonished at seeing a lady so\r\n    well escorted. It was not so, however, with those who knew who\r\n    the lady was.”\r\n\r\nLater he gives us a most characteristic glimpse of the light-hearted\r\ncourage and high spirit of his Lady-in-Chief:—\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Anderson proposed to have a peep at Sebastopol. It was\r\n    four o’clock, and they were firing sharply on both sides.\r\n    Miss Nightingale, to whom the offer was made, immediately\r\n    accepted it; so we formed a column and, for the first time,\r\n    fearlessly faced the enemy, and prepared to go under fire.\r\n    P. M. turned round to me, saying quietly, but with great\r\n    trepidation, ‘I say, Monsieur Soyer, of course you would not\r\n    take Miss Nightingale where there will be any danger?’ ... The\r\n    sentry then repeated his caution, saying, ‘Madam, even where\r\n    you stand you are in great danger; some of the shot reach\r\n    more than half a mile beyond this!’ ... ‘My good young man,’\r\n    replied Miss Nightingale in French, ‘more dead and wounded have\r\n    passed through my hands than I hope you will ever see in the\r\n    battlefield during the whole of your military career; believe\r\n    me, I have no fear of death!’”\r\n\r\nBy a little guile the eager Frenchman led the unsuspecting idol of the\r\ntroops into a position where she could be well seen by the soldiers; and\r\nwhile she was seated on the Morta, in view of them all, it hardly needed\r\nhis own dramatic outcry for a salutation to “the Daughter of England” to\r\ncall forth the ringing cheers which greeted her from the men of the 39th\r\nRegiment, and the shouts were taken up so loudly by all the rest that the\r\nRussians were actually startled by them at Sebastopol.\r\n\r\nThe darkness fell quickly, and half-way back to Balaclava Miss\r\nNightingale and her party found themselves in the midst of a merry\r\nZouave camp, where the men were singing and drinking coffee, but warned\r\nour friends that brigands were in the neighbourhood. However, there\r\nwas nothing for it but to push on, and, as a matter of fact, the only\r\nwound received was from the head of Miss Nightingale’s horse, which hit\r\nviolently against the face of her escort at the bridle rein, who kept\r\nsilence that he might not alarm her, but was found with a face black and\r\nbleeding at the end of the journey.\r\n\r\nAfter her night’s rest in her state-cabin in the _Robert Lowe_, though\r\nstill feeling used up with the adventurous visit to the camp hospitals,\r\nMiss Nightingale visited the General Hospital at Balaclava and the\r\ncollection of huts on the heights, which formed the sanatoria, and\r\nalso went to see an officer ill with typhus in the doctors’ huts. She\r\nrenewed her visit next day, when, after a night at Balaclava, she settled\r\nthree nurses into the sanatorium, and then for some days continued her\r\ninspection of hospitals and moved into the ship _London_, the _Robert\r\nLowe_ having been ordered home.\r\n\r\nWorn out by her ceaseless labours at Scutari, she had probably been\r\nspecially open to infection in the sick officer’s hut, and while on board\r\nthe _London_ it became clear that she had contracted Crimean fever in a\r\nvery bad form.\r\n\r\nShe was ordered up to the huts amid such dreadful lamentations of the\r\nsurrounding folk that, thanks to their well-meant delays, it took an\r\nhour to carry her up to the heights, her faithful nurse, Mrs. Roberts,\r\nkeeping off the sun-glare by walking beside her with an umbrella, and\r\nher page-boy Thomas weeping his heart out at the tail of the little\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nA spot was found after her own heart near a running stream where the wild\r\nflowers were in bloom, and she tells in her _Nursing Notes_ how her first\r\nrecovery began when a nosegay of her beloved flowers was brought to her\r\nbedside. But for some days she was desperately ill, and the camp was\r\nunspeakably moved and alarmed.\r\n\r\nBritain also shared deeply in the suspense, though happily the worst\r\ncrisis was passed in about twelve days, leaving, however, a long time of\r\ngreat weakness and slow convalescence to be won through afterwards.\r\n\r\nDuring those twelve days some very sharp skirmishing took place, and\r\nthere was talk of an attack on Balaclava from the Kamara side, in which\r\ncase Miss Nightingale’s hut would, it was said, be the first outpost\r\nto be attacked. Any such notion was, of course, an injustice to the\r\nRussians, who would not knowingly have hurt a hair of her head—indeed, it\r\nmay almost be said that she was sacred to all the troops, whether friends\r\nor foes. But at all events it gave her boy Thomas his opportunity, and he\r\nwas prepared, we are told, “to die valiantly in defence of his mistress.”\r\n\r\nSoyer gives a picturesque account of Lord Raglan’s visit to Miss\r\nNightingale when her recovery was first beginning. He begins by\r\ndescribing his own visit, and tells the story through the lips of Mrs.\r\nRoberts, Miss Nightingale’s faithful nurse.\r\n\r\n    “ ... I was,” he writes, “very anxious to know the actual state\r\n    of Miss Nightingale’s health, and went to her hut to inquire.\r\n    I found Mrs. Roberts, who was quite astonished and very much\r\n    delighted to see me.\r\n\r\n    “‘Thank God, Monsieur Soyer,’ she exclaimed, ‘you are here\r\n    again. We have all been in such a way about you. Why, it was\r\n    reported that you had been taken prisoner by the Russians. I\r\n    must go and tell Miss Nightingale you are found again.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Don’t disturb her now. I understand Lord Raglan has been to\r\n    see her.’\r\n\r\n    “‘Yes, he has, and I made a serious mistake. It was about five\r\n    o’clock in the afternoon when he came. Miss Nightingale was\r\n    dozing, after a very restless night. We had a storm that day\r\n    and it was very wet. I was in my room sewing when two men on\r\n    horseback, wrapped in large gutta-percha cloaks and dripping\r\n    wet, knocked at the door. I went out, and one inquired in which\r\n    hut Miss Nightingale resided.\r\n\r\n    “‘He spoke so loud that I said, “Hist! hist! don’t make such\r\n    a horrible noise as that, my man,” at the same time making a\r\n    sign with both hands for him to be quiet. He then repeated his\r\n    question, but not in so loud a tone. I told him this was the\r\n    hut.\r\n\r\n    “‘“All right,” said he, jumping from his horse, and he was\r\n    walking straight in when I pushed him back, asking what he\r\n    meant and whom he wanted.\r\n\r\n    “‘“Miss Nightingale,” said he.\r\n\r\n    “‘“And pray who are you?”\r\n\r\n    “‘“Oh, only a soldier,” was the reply; “but I must see her—I\r\n    have come a long way—my name is Raglan: she knows me very well.”\r\n\r\n    “‘Miss Nightingale, overhearing him, called me in, saying, “Oh!\r\n    Mrs. Roberts, it is Lord Raglan. Pray tell him I have a very\r\n    bad fever, and it will be dangerous for him to come near me.”\r\n\r\n    “‘“I have no fear of fever, or anything else,” said Lord Raglan.\r\n\r\n    “‘And before I had time to turn round, in came his lordship. He\r\n    took up a stool, sat down at the foot of the bed, and kindly\r\n    asked Miss Nightingale how she was, expressing his sorrow at\r\n    her illness, and thanking her and praising her for the good she\r\n    had done for the troops. He wished her a speedy recovery, and\r\n    hoped that she might be able to continue her charitable and\r\n    invaluable exertions, so highly appreciated by every one, as\r\n    well as by himself.\r\n\r\n    “‘He then bade Miss Nightingale good-bye, and went away. As he\r\n    was going I said I wished to apologize.\r\n\r\n    “‘“No, no! not at all, my dear lady,” said Lord Raglan; “you\r\n    did very right; for I perceive that Miss Nightingale has not\r\n    yet received my letter, in which I announced my intention of\r\n    paying her a visit to-day—having previously inquired of the\r\n    doctor if she could be seen.”’”[15]\r\n\r\nThe doctors, after her twelve days of dangerous illness, were urgent for\r\nMiss Nightingale’s instant return to England; but this she would not do:\r\nshe was sure that, with time and patience, she would be able once more to\r\ntake up her work at Scutari. Lord Ward placed his yacht at her disposal,\r\nand by slow degrees she made recovery, though Lord Raglan’s death, June\r\n18, 1855, was a great grief and shock to her.\r\n\r\nWellington said of Lord Raglan that he was a man who would not tell a lie\r\nto save his life, and he was also a man of great charm and benevolence,\r\nadored by his troops. He felt to the quick the terrible repulse of our\r\ntroops before Sebastopol that June, having yielded his own counsels to\r\nthose of France rather than break the alliance, and he died two days\r\nafter the despatch was written in which he told the story of this event.\r\n\r\nWriting to the Duke of Newcastle in October, he had entreated for his\r\narmy a little repose—that brave army, worn out, not only by the ordinary\r\nfatigues of a military campaign, and by the actual collecting of wood and\r\nwater to keep life from extinction, but by cholera, sickness, and the\r\nbitter purgatorial cold of a black hillside in a Russian winter.\r\n\r\n“Repose!” echoes Kinglake with sardonic bitterness, and we too echo it,\r\nremembering how, two days afterwards, it was riding through the devil’s\r\njaws at Balaclava, to hurl itself but a little later against its myriad\r\nassailants at Inkermann!\r\n\r\nRepose! uncomplaining and loyal, in the bitter grasp of winter on the\r\nheights of the Chersonese, holding day and night a siege that seemed\r\nendless, the allied armies had proved their heroism through the slow\r\ntragedy. And when at last, on the day of victory, amid the fury of the\r\nelements and the avenging fury of their own surging hearts, they grasped\r\nthe result of their patient agony, though\r\n\r\n    “Stormed at with shot and shell,\r\n    Boldly they rode and well,”\r\n\r\nthat final moment of onset did but crown the fortitude of those long,\r\nslow days of dying by inches in the slow clutch of starvation, that had\r\nbeen so much harder to bear, while they saw their comrades in the anguish\r\nof cholera and felt their own limbs freezing beneath them.\r\n\r\nBut it was doubtless a brave assault, and it was sad that their loved\r\ncommander was not there to see; for, while the Malakoff fell before\r\nthe French, it was the British troops that took the Redan—that Redan\r\nof which it has been written that “three months before it had repulsed\r\nthe attacking force with fearful carnage, and brought Lord Raglan to a\r\ndespairing death.”\r\n\r\nThere is tragedy, therefore, in the fact that when, so soon afterwards,\r\nSebastopol fell, the triumph was not his.\r\n\r\nIt was on September 8, amid a furious storm which suddenly broke up a\r\nsummer-like day, that the cannonade joined with the thunder and the final\r\nassault was made. Though the first shouts of victory came at the end of\r\nan hour, it was nightfall before the fighting ceased and the Russians\r\nretreated. Sebastopol was in flames. And before the next day dawned the\r\nlast act in this terrible war-drama was over.\r\n\r\nWithin a month of leaving Scutari Miss Nightingale was already there\r\nagain, and during these days of slowly returning strength, when she\r\nwandered sometimes through the beautiful cemetery where the strange,\r\nblack-plumaged birds fly above the cypresses and, against the background\r\nof the blue Bosphorus, the roses garland the tombs, she planned, for the\r\nsoldiers who had fallen, the monument which now stands there to their\r\nundying memory, where under the drooping wings of the angels that support\r\nit are inserted the words, “This monument was erected by Queen Victoria\r\nand her people.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n    _The Nightingale Fund—Miss Nightingale remains at her post,\r\n    organizing healthy occupations for the men off duty—Sisters of\r\n    Mercy—The Queen’s jewel—Its meaning._\r\n\r\n\r\nFar and wide spread the news of the fall of Sebastopol, and London took\r\nthe lead in rejoicings. The Tower guns shouted the victory, the arsenals\r\nfired their salutes, cathedrals and village churches rang out their\r\nwelcome to peace. There were sons, husbands, brothers, fathers, for whom\r\nthere would be no more home-coming on earth; and some who would come back\r\nbroken and maimed: but all had served their country, and heroism lasts\r\nbeyond time and death.\r\n\r\nAll through the empire arose an outcry of thanksgiving to the woman who\r\nstill remained at her post among the sick and the dying—the woman who had\r\nsaved England’s honour in the day of disgrace and neglect, and had saved\r\nalso countless lives among her brave sons.\r\n\r\nThe Queen and all her people were eager to know what there was that they\r\nmight lay at her feet. In one form only would Miss Nightingale accept the\r\ntestimony offered—namely, the means of yet further work. The Herberts\r\nknew she had longed to organize a hospital on the lines of unpaid\r\nnursing, but there was a difficulty for the moment, because she could not\r\nbring herself to leave the East until her work there was fully completed,\r\nand such a hospital must, they thought, have her presence from the first.\r\nJust now she was with Sister Aloysius at Balaclava, nursing one of her\r\nstaff, and while there an accident on the rough roads, which injured not\r\nonly herself, but also the Sister who was walking beside her, led to a\r\nthoughtful kindness from Colonel Macmurdo, who had a little carriage\r\nespecially made for her. In this little carriage, through the cutting\r\ncold and snow of a Crimean winter, she would drive about among the camp\r\nhospitals with no escort but her driver, as she returned through the dark\r\nnight at the end of her long day of self-imposed duties. Sometimes she\r\nhas stood for hours on a cold, shelterless rock, giving her directions,\r\nand when one and another of her friends entreated against such risk and\r\nexposure, she would just smile with a quiet certainty that, for all that\r\nin her eyes was her clear duty, strength and protection would certainly\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nShe was much occupied in helping and uplifting the convalescent, and not\r\nonly these, but also all the soldiers in camp in the army of occupation,\r\nwhich was for a while to be left in the East until the treaty was signed,\r\nand would necessarily be surrounded by special temptations in time of\r\npeace. Her way of fighting drunkenness—and after Sebastopol you may be\r\nsure there was a good deal of “drinking of healths”—was to provide all\r\npossible means of interest and amusement. Huts were built, clubs were\r\nformed. Stationery was provided for letters home. So effectually was\r\nevery one in England interested that, while Queen Victoria herself led\r\nthe way in sending newspapers and magazines, all through the country her\r\nexample was followed.\r\n\r\nAnd while this was going on, the great testimonial fund in London was\r\nmounting and mounting.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Cambridge, Lord Houghton, and the Marquis of Ripon were\r\nmembers of the committee. The great bankers opened their books. The\r\nchurches collected funds, _the rank and file of our impoverished army\r\nsent £4,000_, and taking Mrs. Tooley’s figures, which are doubtless\r\ncorrect, and including all ranks and all troops throughout the world, the\r\nmilitary contributions alone appear to have risen to about £10,000.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind, then Madame Goldschmidt, gave a concert, of which she\r\nherself bore all the expense, amounting to about £500, and then gave\r\nthe entire proceeds, about £2,000, to the fund. This was so warmly\r\nappreciated by some of those interested in the success of the fund that,\r\nby private subscription, they gave a marble bust of Queen Victoria to the\r\nGoldschmidts as a thank-offering.\r\n\r\nFrom the overseas dominions came over £4,000; from provincial cities,\r\ntowns, and villages in Britain, between £6,000 and £7,000, and from\r\nBritish residents abroad also a very handsome sum. Indeed, it may be\r\ntruly said that in every quarter of the globe men and women united\r\nto pour forth their gratitude to Miss Nightingale, and to enable her\r\nto complete the work so bravely begun, by transforming the old and\r\nevil methods of nursing under British rule to that ideal art in which\r\nfortitude, tenderness, and skill receive their crowning grace. It has\r\nbeen said—I know not with what exactitude—that no British subject has\r\never received such world-wide honour as was at this time laid at her feet.\r\n\r\nAt one of the great meetings Mr. Sidney Herbert read the following letter\r\nfrom one of his friends:—\r\n\r\n    “I have just heard a pretty account from a soldier describing\r\n    the comfort it was even to see Florence pass. ‘She would speak\r\n    to one and another,’ he said, ‘and nod and smile to many more,\r\n    but she could not do it to all, you know, for we lay there by\r\n    hundreds; but we could kiss her shadow[16] as it fell, and lay\r\n    our heads on the pillow again content.’”\r\n\r\nThat letter alone, we are told, brought another £10,000.\r\n\r\nThe gross amount had reached £44,000, but in 1857 Miss Nightingale\r\ndesired that the list should be closed and help be given instead to our\r\nFrench Allies, who were then suffering from the terrible floods that laid\r\nwaste their country in that year.\r\n\r\nAnd whatever she commanded, of course, was done. Alike in England and in\r\nthe Crimea, her influence was potent for all good.\r\n\r\nShe herself was still busy nursing some of the Roman Catholic members\r\nof her staff in the huts on the snowclad heights of Balaclava, and how\r\nheartily she valued them may be judged from these closing sentences of a\r\nletter to their Reverend Mother:—\r\n\r\n    “You know that I shall do everything I can for the Sisters\r\n    whom you have left me. I will care for them as if they were my\r\n    own children. But it will not be like you.”\r\n\r\nNot very far from the sanatorium on the heights above Balaclava, two new\r\ncamp hospitals had been put up, and while superintending the nursing\r\nthere, our Lady-in-Chief lived in a three-roomed hut with a medical store\r\nattached to it, where she was quite near to sanatorium and hospitals.\r\nShe and the three Sisters who were with her had not very weather-proof\r\nquarters. One of them, whose letters are full of interest, tells of their\r\nwaking one morning to find themselves covered with snow, and leading a\r\nlife of such adventurous simplicity that when the Protestant chaplain\r\nbrought some eggs tied up in a handkerchief the gift was regarded as\r\nprincely! Happily, they were able to reward the gentleman by washing his\r\nneckties, and ironing them with an ingenious makeshift for the missing\r\nflat-iron, in the shape of a teapot filled with hot water. Every night\r\neverything in the huts froze, even to the ink. But Miss Nightingale tells\r\nhow brave and entirely self-forgetful the Sisters were under every\r\nhardship and privation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Nightingale’s Medals and Decorations.]\r\n\r\nBy those who have never had the privilege of knowing such women\r\nintimately, her affection for them may be the better understood from the\r\nfollowing graphic letter written by Lord Napier:—\r\n\r\n    “At an early period of my life I held a diplomatic position\r\n    under Lord Stratford de Redcliffe in Constantinople. During\r\n    the distress of the Crimean War the Ambassador called me one\r\n    morning and said: ‘Go down to the port; you will find a ship\r\n    there loaded with Jewish exiles—Russian subjects from the\r\n    Crimea. It is your duty to disembark them. The Turks will give\r\n    you a house in which they may be placed. I turn them over\r\n    entirely to you.’ I went down to the shore and received about\r\n    two hundred persons, the most miserable objects that could be\r\n    witnessed, most of them old men, women, and children. I placed\r\n    them in the cold, ruinous lodging allocated to them by the\r\n    Ottoman authorities. I went back to the Ambassador and said:\r\n    ‘Your Excellency, these people are cold, and I have no fuel\r\n    or blankets. They are hungry, and I have no food. They are\r\n    dirty, and I have no soap. Their hair is in an indescribable\r\n    condition, and I have no combs. What am I to do with these\r\n    people?’ ‘Do?’ said the Ambassador. ‘Get a couple of Sisters\r\n    of Mercy; they will put all to right in a moment.’ I went, saw\r\n    the Mother Superior, and explained the case. I asked for two\r\n    Sisters. She ordered two from her presence to follow me. They\r\n    were ladies of refinement and intellect. I was a stranger and\r\n    a Protestant, and I invoked their assistance for the benefit\r\n    of the Jews. Yet these two women made up their bundles and\r\n    followed me through the rain, without a look, a whisper, a\r\n    sign of hesitation. From that moment my fugitives were saved.\r\n    I witnessed the labours of those Sisters for months, and they\r\n    never endeavoured to make a single convert.”\r\n\r\nThe military men were not less enthusiastic. When Colonel Connolly,\r\nbrother-in-law to Mr. Bruin, of Carlow, was travelling, after his\r\nreturn from the war, near the Bruin estate, a fellow-traveller spoke\r\ndisrespectfully of nuns. The colonel, a Protestant, not only made a warm\r\ndefence of the ladies who had nursed him in Russia and Ottoman regions,\r\nand for their sakes of all other nuns, but handed the assailant his card,\r\nsaying: “If you say another word against these saintly gentlewomen I\r\nshall call you out.” The slanderer subsided very quickly.\r\n\r\nSister Aloysius, one of those very Sisters who were with Miss Nightingale\r\nin the huts, has written in her “Memories of the Crimea”:—\r\n\r\n    “It was said at one time that the War Office was on the point\r\n    of issuing a mandate forbidding us to speak even to the\r\n    Catholic soldiers on religion, or to say a prayer for them.\r\n    However, that mandate never came; we often thought the guardian\r\n    angels of the soldiers prevented it.”\r\n\r\nIt made no difference to the loyalty of their work together that Miss\r\nNightingale was not a Roman Catholic; they all obeyed the Master who has\r\ntaught that it is not the way in which He is addressed that matters, but\r\nwhether we help those whom He gave His life to help, and in loving and\r\nserving whom, we love and serve Him.\r\n\r\nSo in London and in Balaclava the good of her influence was felt. In\r\nLondon the funds mounted, and at Balaclava the excellent work among the\r\nsoldiers still went on.\r\n\r\nHer very presence among the men helped to keep them sober and diligent,\r\nand in every way at their best, in those first months of victory when\r\nheads are only too easily turned. And she had the reward she most\r\ndesired, for she was able to speak of these brave fellows—the nameless\r\nheroes of the long campaign—as having been “uniformly quiet and\r\nwell-bred.” Those words, it is true, were spoken of the men attending the\r\nreading-huts; but they are quite in line with her more general verdict\r\nwith regard to Tommy; though, alas, we cannot stretch them to cover\r\nhis behaviour at the canteens, where we are told that much drunkenness\r\nprevailed.\r\n\r\nShe had advanced money for the building of a coffee-house at Inkermann,\r\nand had helped the chaplain to get maps and slates for his school work,\r\nand the bundles of magazines and illustrated papers, sent out from\r\nEngland in answer to her appeal, as well as books sent out by the Duchess\r\nof Kent, cheered and brightened many a long hour for the men. She was\r\nalways on the alert to help them about sending home their pay, and quick\r\nto care for the interests of their wives and children.\r\n\r\nBefore she left the Crimea, her hut was beset by fifty or sixty poor\r\nwomen who had been left behind when their husbands sailed for home with\r\ntheir regiments. They had followed their husbands to the war without\r\nleave and, having proved themselves useful, had been allowed to remain.\r\nAnd now they were left alone in a strange land and, but for Florence\r\nNightingale, the end of the story might have been bitter sorrow. But she\r\nmanaged to get them sent home in a British ship.\r\n\r\nMany a mother at home must already have blessed her; for reckless boys\r\nwho had enlisted, without the sanction of their families, had again and\r\nagain been by her persuaded to write home, and in the first months of\r\nthe war she had actually undertaken to stamp for the men any letters\r\nhome which were sent to her camp. And at Scutari she had arranged a\r\nprovisional money-order office where, four afternoons in each week, she\r\nreceived from the men the pay which she encouraged them to send home.\r\nWhen we are told that, in small sums, about £1,000 passed through this\r\noffice month by month, we realize dimly something of the labour involved,\r\nand thinking of all her other cares and labours, which were nevertheless\r\nnot allowed to stand in the way of such practical thoughtfulness as\r\nthis, we do not wonder that “the services” loved her with a love that\r\nwas akin to worship. The money, as she herself says, “was literally so\r\nmuch rescued from the canteens and from drunkenness;” and the Government,\r\nfollowing her lead, had themselves established money-order offices later\r\nat Scutari, Balaclava, Constantinople, and the Headquarters, Crimea.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that, in the “Old Country,” songs were dedicated to\r\nher as “the good angel of Derbyshire,” and that her very portrait became\r\na popular advertisement.\r\n\r\nAnd we have it on good authority that her name was revered alike by\r\nEnglish, French, Turks, and Russians.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Peace was signed at Paris on March 30, 1856, and on July\r\n12 General Codrington formally gave up Sebastopol and Balaclava to the\r\nRussians. When the last remnant of our army was ordered home and the\r\nhospitals were finally closed, Florence Nightingale was for the first\r\ntime willing to leave a post which she had held so bravely and so long.\r\nBut before she left she wished to leave a memorial to the brave men who\r\nhad fallen, and the brave women, her comrades, who had died upon that\r\nother battlefield where disease, and Death himself, must be wrestled with\r\non behalf of those who are nursed and tended.\r\n\r\nAnd so it comes to pass that among the visible tokens which the war\r\nhas left behind, is a gigantic white marble cross erected by Florence\r\nNightingale upon the sombre heights of Balaclava, where it still opens\r\nwide its arms for every gleam of golden sunlight, every reflected\r\nshimmer, through the dark night, of silvery moon and star, to hearten\r\nthe sailors voyaging northward and mark a prayer for the brave men and\r\nwomen who toiled and suffered there. It is inscribed with the words in\r\nItalian, “Lord, have mercy upon us.” But while she herself asked only\r\nmercy for herself and others, that human shortcomings might be forgiven,\r\nher compatriots were uniting to do her honour.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 1855, the _Morning Post_ printed the following\r\nannouncement:—\r\n\r\n    “The country will experience much satisfaction, though no\r\n    surprise, on learning, as we believe we are correct in stating,\r\n    that Her Majesty the Queen has, in a manner as honourable to\r\n    herself as it must be gratifying to her people, been pleased to\r\n    mark her warm appreciation of the unparalleled self-devotion\r\n    of the good Miss Nightingale. The Queen has transmitted to\r\n    that lady a jewelled ornament of great beauty, which may be\r\n    worn as a decoration, and has accompanied it with an autograph\r\n    letter—such a letter as Queen Victoria has ere now proved she\r\n    can write—a letter not merely of graceful acknowledgment, but\r\n    full of that deep feeling which speaks from heart to heart, and\r\n    at once ennobles the sovereign and the subject.”\r\n\r\nOf the symbolic meaning of this jewel the following exposition appeared\r\nin the issue of January 15, 1856, of the same paper:—\r\n\r\n    “The design of the jewel is admirable, and the effect\r\n    no less brilliant than chaste. It is characteristic and\r\n    emblematical—being formed of a St. George’s cross in ruby-red\r\n    enamel, on a white field—representing England. This is\r\n    encircled by a black band, typifying the office of Charity, on\r\n    which is inscribed a golden legend, ‘Blessed are the merciful.’\r\n    The Royal donor is expressed by the letters ‘V. R.’ surmounted\r\n    by a crown in diamonds, impressed upon the centre of the St.\r\n    George’s cross, from which also rays of gold emanating upon\r\n    the field of white enamel are supposed to represent the glory\r\n    of England. While spreading branches of palm, in bright green\r\n    enamel, tipped with gold, form a framework for the shield,\r\n    their stems at the bottom being banded with a ribbon of blue\r\n    enamel (the colour of the ribbon for the Crimean medal), on\r\n    which, in golden letters, is inscribed ‘Crimea.’ At the top\r\n    of the shield, between the palm branches, and connecting the\r\n    whole, three brilliant stars of diamonds illustrate the idea\r\n    of the light of heaven shed upon the labours of Mercy, Peace,\r\n    and Charity, in connection with the glory of a nation. On the\r\n    back of this Royal jewel is an inscription on a golden tablet,\r\n    written by Her Majesty ... recording it to be a gift and\r\n    testimonial in memory of services rendered to her brave army by\r\n    Miss Nightingale. The jewel is about three inches in depth by\r\n    two and a half in width. It is to be worn, not as a brooch or\r\n    ornament, but rather as the badge of an order. We believe the\r\n    credit of the design is due to the illustrious consort of Her\r\n    Majesty.”\r\n\r\n_Punch_, of course, had always taken the liveliest interest in Miss\r\nNightingale’s work, and having begun with friendly jesting, he ended\r\nwith a tribute so tender in its grave beauty that it would hardly have\r\nbeen out of place in a church window; for below a sketch of Florence\r\nNightingale herself, holding a wounded soldier by the hand, and with the\r\nbadge of Scutari across her breast, was a vision of the Good Samaritan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n    _Her citizenship—Her initiative—Public recognition and\r\n    gratitude—Her return incognito—Village excitement—The country’s\r\n    welcome—Miss Nightingale’s broken health—The Nightingale\r\n    Fund—St. Thomas’s Hospital—Reform of nursing as a profession._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be fairly supposed that even those benighted Philistines whose\r\nmockery had at the outset been of a less innocent quality than _Punch’s_\r\ngentle fun, now found it expedient to alter their tone, and if their\r\nobjections had been mere honest stupidity, they were probably both\r\nconvinced of their past folly and a good deal ashamed.\r\n\r\nFor Britain was very proud of the daughter who had become so mighty a\r\npower for good in the State. The Sister of Mercy whom Miss Nightingale\r\nused laughingly to call “her Cardinal” had responded on one occasion by\r\naddressing her with equal affection as “Your Holiness,” and the nickname\r\nwas not altogether inappropriate, for her advice in civic and hygienic\r\nmatters had an authority which might well be compared with that which the\r\nPope himself wielded on theological questions.\r\n\r\nAmong the doctors at Scutari was a friend of General Evatt, from whom he\r\nhad many facts at first-hand, and it was therefore not without knowledge\r\nthat, in his conversation with me on the subject, the latter confirmed\r\nand strengthened all that has already been written of Miss Nightingale’s\r\nmental grasp and supreme capacity. To him, knowing her well, and knowing\r\nwell also the facts, she was the highest embodiment of womanhood and of\r\ncitizenship. Yet, while he talked, my heart ached for her, thinking of\r\nthe womanly joys of home and motherhood which were not for her, and all\r\nthe pure and tender romance which woman bears in her inmost soul, even\r\nwhen, as in this noble instance, it is transmuted by the will of God and\r\nthe woman’s own obedient will into service of other homes and other lives.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I may here be allowed to quote a sentence from Mrs. Tooley’s\r\nadmirable life of our heroine; for it could not have been better\r\nexpressed: “No one would wish to exempt from due praise even the humblest\r\nof that ‘Angel Band’ who worked with Florence Nightingale, and still less\r\nwould she, but in every great cause there is the initiating genius who\r\nstands in solitary grandeur above the rank and file of followers.”\r\n\r\nNor was official recognition of the country’s debt to Miss Nightingale in\r\nany wise lacking. When the Treaty of Peace was under discussion in the\r\nHouse of Lords, Lord Ellesmere made it an opportunity for the following\r\ntribute:—\r\n\r\n    “My Lords, the agony of that time has become a matter of\r\n    history. The vegetation of two successive springs has obscured\r\n    the vestiges of Balaclava and of Inkermann. Strong voices now\r\n    answer to the roll-call, and sturdy forms now cluster round\r\n    the colours. The ranks are full, the hospitals are empty. The\r\n    Angel of Mercy still lingers to the last on the scene of\r\n    her labours; but her mission is all but accomplished. Those\r\n    long arcades of Scutari, in which dying men sat up to catch\r\n    the sound of her footstep or the flutter of her dress, and\r\n    fell back on the pillow content to have seen her shadow as it\r\n    passed, are now comparatively deserted. She may probably be\r\n    thinking how to escape, as best she may, on her return, the\r\n    demonstrations of a nation’s appreciation of the deeds and\r\n    motives of Florence Nightingale.”\r\n\r\nAnd in the House of Commons Mr. Sidney Herbert said: “I have received,\r\nnot only from medical men, but from many others who have had an\r\nopportunity of making observations, letters couched in the highest\r\npossible terms of praise. I will not repeat the words, but no higher\r\nexpressions of praise could be applied to woman, for the wonderful\r\nenergy, the wonderful tact, the wonderful tenderness, combined with\r\nthe extraordinary self-devotion, which have been displayed by Miss\r\nNightingale.”\r\n\r\nLord Ellesmere was right when he hinted that Miss Nightingale would\r\nbe likely to do her best to escape all public fuss on her return. The\r\nGovernment had offered her a British man-of-war to take her home; but\r\nit was not her way to accept any such outward pomp, and, almost before\r\npeople knew what had happened, it was found that she had travelled\r\nquietly home as Miss Smith in a French vessel, visiting in Paris her old\r\nfriends the Sisters of St. Vincent de Paul, and finding that by having\r\nembarked at night, at a moment when Scutari was not looking for her\r\ndeparture, her little _ruse_ had been very successful. An eager people\r\nhad not recognized under the passing incognito of Miss Smith, travelling\r\nwith her aunt, Mrs. Smith, the great Florence Nightingale whose return\r\nthey had wished to celebrate. The village gossips at Lea Hurst have it\r\nthat “the closely veiled lady in black, who slipped into her father’s\r\nhouse by the back door, was first recognized by the family butler,” and\r\nit seems a pity to spoil such a picturesque tradition by inquiring into\r\nit too closely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Nightingale Nursing Carriage.]\r\n\r\nThere was great joy among the villagers that “Miss Florence had come\r\nhome from the wars,” but it was understood that she wished to be quiet,\r\nand that bonfires and such-like rejoicings were out of the question.\r\n\r\nAlong the roads near Lea Hurst came troops of people from Derby and\r\nNottingham, and even from Manchester, hoping to catch a glimpse of her;\r\nand there is in one of the biographies a vivid account, given by the old\r\nlady who kept the lodge gates, of how the park round Lea Hurst was beset\r\nby these lingering crowds, how men came without arms or without legs,\r\nhoping to see the Queen of Nurses. “But,” added the old lady, “the squire\r\nwasn’t a-going to let Miss Florence be made a staring-stock of.” And,\r\nindeed, “Miss Florence” must have been in great need of repose, though\r\nnever to the end of her life would it seem that she was allowed to have\r\nmuch of it; for the very fruitfulness of her work made work multiply upon\r\nher hands, and her friend Mrs. Sidney Herbert knew her well when she said\r\nthat to Florence Nightingale the dearest guerdon of work already done was\r\nthe gift of more work still to do.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall never any of us fully know what it must have been to one\r\nso abounding in spiritual energy and world-wide compassion to have to\r\nlearn slowly and painfully, through the years that followed, what must\r\nhenceforth be the physical limitations of her life. When we think of\r\nthe long, careful training that had been given to her fine gifts of eye\r\nand hand in the art that she loved—for she rightly regarded nursing as\r\nan art—an art in which every movement must be a skilled and disciplined\r\nmovement—we may divine something of what it cost to bear, without one\r\nmurmur of complaint, what she might so easily have been tempted to regard\r\nas a lifelong waste of faculty. Instead of allowing herself to dwell on\r\nany such idea, gradually, as the knowledge dawned on her of what she must\r\nforego, she gave herself, with tenfold power in other directions, to work\r\nwhich _could_ be achieved from an invalid’s couch, and thus helped and\r\nguided others in that art all over the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the greetings which pleased her most on her first return to England\r\nwas an address from the workmen of Newcastle-on-Tyne, to whom she\r\nreplied in the following letter:—\r\n\r\n                                                 _August 23, 1856._\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR FRIENDS,—I wish it were in my power to tell you what\r\n    was in my heart when I received your letter.\r\n\r\n    “Your welcome home, your sympathy with what has been passing\r\n    while I have been absent, have touched me more than I can tell\r\n    in words. My dear friends, the things that are the deepest\r\n    in our hearts are perhaps what it is most difficult for us\r\n    to express. ‘She hath done what she could.’ These words I\r\n    inscribed on the tomb of one of my best helpers when I left\r\n    Scutari. It has been my endeavour, in the sight of God, to do\r\n    as she has done.\r\n\r\n    “I will not speak of reward when permitted to do our country’s\r\n    work—it is what we live for—but I may say to receive sympathy\r\n    from affectionate hearts like yours is the greatest support,\r\n    the greatest gratification, that it is possible for me to\r\n    receive from man.\r\n\r\n    “I thank you all, the eighteen hundred, with grateful, tender\r\n    affection. And I should have written before to do so, were not\r\n    the business, which my return home has not ended, been almost\r\n    more than I can manage.—Pray believe me, my dear friends, yours\r\n    faithfully and gratefully,\r\n\r\n                                            “FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the tokens of regard which the late Duke of Devonshire brought to\r\nhis old friend on her return, when he drove over from Chatsworth to Lea\r\nHurst to see her after her long, eventful absence, was a little silver\r\nowl, a sort of souvenir, I suppose, of her beloved little “Athena,”\r\nwhose death she had felt so keenly when leaving for the Crimea. Queen\r\nVictoria and the young princesses were eager to welcome Miss Nightingale\r\nto Balmoral; and in looking back on her little visit there, which seems\r\nto have been a happiness on both sides, it is interesting to see how her\r\ninfluence told upon the Crown Princess and Princess Alice in their later\r\norganization of hospital work, and to be reminded by Mrs. Tooley, whose\r\nwords we here venture to quote, that the “tiny Princess Helena was to\r\nbecome in after years an accomplished nurse, and an active leader in the\r\nnursing movement of this country; and, alas, to yield her soldier son on\r\nthe fatal field of South Africa.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, before and after this visit, Miss Nightingale was quietly\r\nreceiving her own friends and neighbours at Lea Hurst, and entertaining\r\nlittle parties of villagers from among the rustics she had so long known\r\nand loved. Rich and poor alike were all so eager to do her honour that\r\nit is impossible to speak separately of all the many forms which their\r\nexpressions of gratitude took. They included a gift from the workmen of\r\nSheffield as well as from her own more immediate neighbours, and found\r\ntheir climax in the fund pressed upon her by a grateful nation, and for\r\nconvenience called the Nightingale Fund, which was still awaiting its\r\nfinal disposal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, imagine the importance of the ex-drummer-boy Thomas, her\r\ndevoted servant and would-be defender at Balaclava, promoted now to\r\nbe “Miss Nightingale’s own man” in her home at Lea Hurst—an even more\r\nexciting presence to the villagers than the Russian hound which was\r\nknown through the country-side as “Miss Florence’s Crimean dog.”\r\n\r\nThere were still living, we are told, when Mrs. Tooley wrote her\r\ndelightful record, a few old people round about Lea Hurst who remembered\r\nthose great days of “Miss Florence’s return,” and the cannon balls and\r\nbullets they had seen as trophies, the dried flowers gathered at Scutari,\r\nand Thomas’s thrilling stories, for if he had not himself been present\r\nin the famous charge at Balaclava, he did at least know all about it at\r\nfirst-hand.\r\n\r\nSo little did any one dream that Miss Nightingale’s health had been\r\npermanently shattered that when the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, she\r\noffered to go out to her friend Lady Canning, and organize a nursing\r\nstaff for the troops. And while, with her customary business-like\r\nclearness, she proceeded to draw up a detailed account of all the\r\nprivate gifts entrusted to her for the Crimea, and took the opportunity\r\nof putting on record her tribute to Lord Raglan, the final arrangements\r\nwith regard to the Nightingale Fund were still for a time held in\r\nsuspense, in the hope that she would so far recover strength as to be\r\nable to take into her own hands the government of that institution for\r\nthe training of hospital nurses, to which it was to be devoted. When her\r\nfriend Mr. Herbert talked gaily in public of chaining her to the oar\r\nfor the rest of her life, that she might “raise the system of nursing\r\nto a pitch of efficiency never before known,” he did not foresee that\r\nthe invisible chain, which was to bruise her eager spirit, was to be of\r\na kind so much harder to bear. But when, in 1860, her health showed no\r\nsigns of recovery, she definitely handed over to others the management\r\nof the fund, only reserving to herself the right to advise. Her friend\r\nMr. Herbert was, up to the time of his death, the guiding spirit of the\r\ncouncil, and it gave Miss Nightingale pleasure that St. Thomas’s Hospital\r\nshould from the outset be associated with the scheme, because that\r\nhospital had originated in one of the oldest foundations in the country\r\nfor the relief of the sick poor, and in choosing it for the training of\r\nlay sisters as nurses, its earliest tradition was being continued. The\r\nwork of the fund began at St. Thomas’s in 1860, in the old building near\r\nLondon Bridge, before it moved into its present palace at Westminster,\r\nof which the Nightingale Training Home is a part. In those first early\r\ndays an upper floor was arranged for the nurses in a new part of the\r\nold hospital, with a bedroom for each probationer, two rooms for the\r\nSister-in-charge, and a sitting-room in which all shared. As the result\r\nof the advertisement for candidates in 1860, fifteen probationers were\r\nadmitted in June, the first superintendent being Mrs. Wardroper. The\r\nprobationers were, of course, under the authority of the matron, and\r\nsubject to the rules of the hospital. They were to give help in the wards\r\nand receive teaching from the Sisters and medical staff, and if at the\r\nend of the year they passed their examination, they were to be registered\r\nas certified nurses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Miss Nightingale visiting the Herbert Hospital, Woolwich.\r\n\r\n(_Bas-relief on the pedestal—Herbert Memorial._)]\r\n\r\nThanks to Miss Nightingale and other pioneers, the fifty years that have\r\npassed since then have made Mrs. Grundy a little less Grundyish, but in\r\nthose days she considered the whole business a terrible venture, and was\r\ntoo much occupied with the idea of possible love affairs between the\r\ndoctors and nurses to realize what good work was being done. The first\r\nyear was a very anxious one for Miss Nightingale, but all the world\r\nknows now how her experiment has justified itself and how her prayers\r\nhave been answered; for it was in prayer that she found her “quietness\r\nand confidence” through those first months of tension when the enemy was\r\nwatching and four probationers had to be dismissed, though their ranks\r\nwere speedily filled up by others.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, from among those who were placed on the\r\nregister, six received appointments at St. Thomas’s and two took work\r\nin infirmaries. There was special need of good nurses in workhouse\r\ninfirmaries, and there was also throughout the whole country a crying\r\nneed for nurses carefully trained in midwifery: lack of knowledge, for\r\ninstance, had greatly increased the danger of puerperal fever, a scourge\r\nagainst which Miss Nightingale was one of the first to contend; and it\r\nhad been wisely decided that while two-thirds of the fund should go to\r\nthe work at St. Thomas’s, one-third should be used for special training\r\nof nurses in these branches at King’s College.\r\n\r\n    “How has the tone and state of hospital nurses been raised?”\r\n    Miss Nightingale asks in her little book on “Trained Nursing\r\n    for the Sick Poor,” published in 1876.\r\n\r\n    “By, more than anything else, making the hospital such a home\r\n    as good young women—educated young women—can live and nurse\r\n    in; and, secondly, by raising hospital nursing into such a\r\n    profession as these can earn an honourable livelihood in.”\r\n\r\nIn her “Notes on Hospitals,” published in 1859, she pointed out what she\r\nconsidered the four radical defects in hospital construction—namely:—\r\n\r\n    1. The agglomeration of a large number of sick under the same\r\n    roof.\r\n\r\n    2. Deficiency of space.\r\n\r\n    3. Deficiency of ventilation.\r\n\r\n    4. Deficiency of light.\r\n\r\nHow magnificently builders have since learned to remedy such defects may\r\nbe seen in the Nightingale Wing of St. Thomas’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe block system on which St. Thomas’s Hospital is built is what Miss\r\nNightingale has always recommended, each block being divided from the\r\nnext by a space of 125 feet, across which runs a double corridor by means\r\nof which they communicate with one another. Each has three tiers of wards\r\nabove the ground floor.\r\n\r\nThe six blocks in the centre are those used for patients, that at the\r\nsouth for the lecture-rooms and a school of medicine, the one at the\r\nnorth, adjoining Westminster Bridge, for the official staff. From Lambeth\r\nPalace to Westminster Bridge, with a frontage of 1,700 feet, the hospital\r\nextends; and there would be room in the operating theatre for 600\r\nstudents. In the special wing in one of the northern blocks, reserved for\r\nthe Nightingale Home and Training School for Nurses, everything has been\r\nordered in accordance with Miss Nightingale’s wishes.\r\n\r\nTo-day the whole _status_ of nursing in Britain and British dominions\r\nis recognized as that of an honoured and certified profession, and\r\nyear by year, at St. Thomas’s alone, thirty probationers are trained,\r\nof whom fifteen pay £1, 1_s._ a week for the privilege, whereas to the\r\nother fifteen it is given gratuitously. At St. Thomas’s were trained\r\nnurses who were among the earliest to be decorated with the Red Cross,\r\nthat international badge of good army nursing throughout the world\r\nwhich, indirectly as well as directly, owed much to Miss Nightingale.\r\nHow warmly, even arduously, Miss Nightingale shared in the trials and\r\njoys and adventures of her nurses, comes out very clearly in some of\r\nher letters to one of them, whom, as a personal friend and one of the\r\nfirst nine to receive the Red Cross, she playfully named “her Cape of\r\nGood Hope.” Those tender and intimate letters, which I will not name\r\nemotional, because she who wrote them had justified emotion by ever\r\ntranslating it into useful work, made me feel to an almost startling\r\ndegree her warm, eager, dominating personality with its extraordinary\r\nmingling of utmost modesty and pleading authority. To me that personality\r\nseems to win the heart of the coldest and dullest by its ardent\r\nenthusiasm and humility, and those unpublished letters, which I was\r\nprivileged to read, brought home to me how Miss Nightingale—then an\r\ninvalid of sixty-two—literally _lived_ in the life of those pioneer\r\nnurses whom she had inspired and sent forth.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see in them how much she feared for her nurses any innocent\r\nlittle trip of the tongue, with regard to the rest of the staff, which\r\nmight set rolling the dangerous ball of hospital gossip. She puts the\r\nduty of obedience and forbearance on the highest grounds, and she draws\r\na useful distinction between the sham dignity which we all know in the\r\nhatefulness of “the superior person,” and the true dignity which tries to\r\nuplift those less fortunate, rather than self-indulgently to lean on them\r\nor make to them foolish confidences.\r\n\r\nAnd while she is all aglow with sympathy for every detail of a nurse’s\r\nwork, she entreats her friend to “let no want of concord or discretion\r\nappear to mar that blessed work. And let no one,” she adds, “be able\r\njustly to say what was said to me last month, ‘It is only Roman Catholic\r\nvows that can keep Sisters together.’”\r\n\r\nWhat she wrote when asking for recruits for St. Thomas’s at the outset\r\nstill remains the basis of the ideal held there. “We require,” she wrote,\r\n“that a woman be sober, honest, truthful, without which there is no\r\nfoundation on which to build.\r\n\r\n“We train her in habits of punctuality, quietness, trustworthiness,\r\npersonal neatness. We teach her how to manage the concerns of a large\r\nward or establishment. We train her in dressing wounds and other\r\ninjuries, and in performing all those minor operations which nurses are\r\ncalled upon day and night to undertake.\r\n\r\n“We teach her how to manage helpless patients in regard to moving,\r\nchanging, feeding, temperature, and the prevention of bedsores.\r\n\r\n“She has to make and apply bandages, line splints, and the like. She must\r\nknow how to make beds with as little disturbance as possible to their\r\ninmates. She is instructed how to wait at operations, and as to the kind\r\nof aid the surgeon requires at her hands. She is taught cooking for the\r\nsick; the principle on which sick wards ought to be cleansed, aired, and\r\nwarmed; the management of convalescents; and how to observe sick and\r\nmaimed patients, so as to give an intelligent and truthful account to the\r\nphysician or surgeon in regard to the progress of cases in the intervals\r\nbetween visits—a much more difficult thing than is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n“We do not seek to make ‘medical women,’ but simply nurses acquainted\r\nwith the principle which they are required constantly to apply at the\r\nbedside.\r\n\r\n“For the future superintendent is added a course of instruction in\r\nthe administration of a hospital, including, of course, the linen\r\narrangements, and what else is necessary for a matron to be conversant\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n“There are those who think that all this is intuitive in women, that they\r\nare born so, or, at least, that it comes to them without training. To\r\nsuch we say, by all means send us as many such geniuses as you can, for\r\nwe are sorely in want of them.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n    _William Rathbone—Agnes Jones—Infirmaries—Nursing in the homes\r\n    of the poor—Municipal work—Homely power of Miss Nightingale’s\r\n    writings—Lord Herbert’s death._\r\n\r\n\r\nA word must here be said of Mr. William Rathbone’s work in Liverpool.\r\nAfter the death of his first wife, realizing the comfort and help that\r\nhad been given during her last illness by a trained nurse, he determined\r\nto do what he could to bring aid of the same kind into the homes of the\r\npoor, where the need was often so much more terrible. This brought him\r\ninto touch with Miss Nightingale, who advised him to start a school of\r\nnursing in connection with the Liverpool Hospital. These two friends—for\r\nthey soon became trusted and valued friends, each to each—were both\r\npeople of prompt and efficient action, and one step led to another,\r\nuntil Liverpool had not only an important school of nurses for the sick\r\npoor, but also led the way throughout the country in the reform of the\r\nhitherto scandalous nursing in workhouse infirmaries. Mr. Rathbone set\r\nhis mind on securing the services of Miss Agnes Elizabeth Jones to help\r\nhim in his work, a woman of character as saintly as his own, and the\r\ndifference in their religious outlook only made more beautiful their\r\nmutual relations in this great work.\r\n\r\nMiss Agnes Jones, who has already been mentioned more than once in these\r\npages, left an undying record on England’s roll of honour. It was of her\r\nthat in 1868 Miss Nightingale wrote[17]:—\r\n\r\n    “A woman attractive and rich, and young and witty; yet a veiled\r\n    and silent woman, distinguished by no other genius but the\r\n    divine genius—working hard to train herself in order to train\r\n    others to walk in the footsteps of Him who went about doing\r\n    good.... She died, as she had lived, at her post in one of\r\n    the largest workhouse infirmaries in this kingdom—the first\r\n    in which trained nursing has been introduced.... When her\r\n    whole life and image rise before me, so far from thinking the\r\n    story of Una and her lion a myth, I say here is Una in real\r\n    flesh and blood—Una and her paupers far more untamable than\r\n    lions. In less than three years she had reduced one of the\r\n    most disorderly hospital populations in the world to something\r\n    like Christian discipline, and had converted a vestry to the\r\n    conviction of the economy as well as humanity of nursing pauper\r\n    sick by trained nurses.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was in introducing a book about the Liverpool Home and School for\r\nNurses that she wrote:—\r\n\r\n    “Nursing, especially that most important of all its\r\n    branches—nursing of the sick poor at home—is no amateur work.\r\n    To do it as it ought to be done requires knowledge, practice,\r\n    self-abnegation, and, as is so well said here, direct obedience\r\n    to and activity under the highest of all masters and from the\r\n    highest of all motives. It is an essential part of the daily\r\n    service of the Christian Church. It has never been otherwise.\r\n    It has proved itself superior to all religious divisions,\r\n    and is destined, by God’s blessing, to supply an opening the\r\n    great value of which, in our densely populated towns, has been\r\n    unaccountably overlooked until within these few years.”\r\n\r\nAs early as 1858 Miss Nightingale published “Notes on Matters affecting\r\nthe Health, Efficiency, and Hospital Administration of the British Army,”\r\nand the commission on this subject appointed in 1857 set a high value on\r\nher evidence.\r\n\r\nSomething of the development that followed along both these lines—that of\r\narmy reform and of nursing among the submerged—may be gleaned from the\r\nfollowing clear statement of fact which appeared during the South African\r\nWar, on May 21, 1900, in a great London daily:—\r\n\r\n    “In the forty and more years that have elapsed since her\r\n    return, Miss Nightingale has seen the whole system of army\r\n    nursing and hospitals transformed. Netley, which has been\r\n    visited by the Queen again this week, was designed by her, and\r\n    for the next largest, namely, the Herbert Hospital, Woolwich,\r\n    she assisted and advised Sir Douglas Galton in his plans.\r\n\r\n    “There is not a naval or military hospital on any of the\r\n    foreign stations or depôts on which she has not been consulted,\r\n    and matters concerning the health and well-being of both\r\n    services have been constantly brought before her. District\r\n    nursing owes much to her, and in this connection may be cited\r\n    a few lines from a letter which she wrote when Princess\r\n    Louise, Duchess of Argyll, was initiating a movement to\r\n    establish a home for the Queen’s Jubilee Nurses in Chiswick and\r\n    Hammersmith. ‘I look upon district nursing,’ she wrote, ‘as\r\n    one of the most hopeful of the agencies for raising the poor,\r\n    physically as well as morally, its province being not only\r\n    nursing the patient, but nursing the room, showing the family\r\n    and neighbours how to second the nurse, and eminently how to\r\n    nurse health as well as disease.’”\r\n\r\n    “Everywhere,” we read in Mr. Stephen Paget’s contribution to\r\n    the “Dictionary of National Biography,” “her expert reputation\r\n    was paramount,” and “during the American Civil War of 1862-4,\r\n    and the Franco-German War of 1870-1, her advice was eagerly\r\n    sought by the governments concerned.” The “Dictionary of\r\n    National Biography” also assures us that “in regard to civil\r\n    hospitals, home nursing, care of poor women in childbirth, and\r\n    sanitation, Miss Nightingale’s authority stood equally high.”\r\n\r\nIn what she wrote there was a homely directness, a complete absence of\r\nanything like pose or affectation, which more than doubled her power, and\r\nwas the more charming in a woman of such brilliant acquirements and—to\r\nquote once more Dean Stanley’s words—such “commanding genius”; but, then,\r\ngenius is of its nature opposed to all that is sentimental or artificial.\r\n\r\nI believe it is in her “Notes on Nursing for the Labouring Classes” that\r\nshe writes to those who are “minding baby”: “One-half of all the nurses\r\nin service are girls of from five to twenty years old. You see you are\r\nvery important little people. Then there are all the girls who are\r\nnursing mother’s baby at home; and in all these cases it seems pretty\r\nnearly to come to this, that baby’s health for its whole life depends\r\nupon you, girls, more than upon anything else.” Simple rules, such as\r\na girl of six could understand, are given for the feeding, washing,\r\ndressing, nursing, and even amusement of that important person, “baby.”\r\n\r\nAnd it is in her best known book of all that she says: “The healthiest,\r\nhappiest, liveliest, most beautiful baby I ever saw was the only child of\r\na busy laundress. She washed all day in a room with the door open upon a\r\nlarger room, where she put the child. It sat or crawled upon the floor\r\nall day with no other playfellow than a kitten, which it used to hug. Its\r\nmother kept it beautifully clean, and fed it with perfect regularity. The\r\nchild was never frightened at anything. The room where it sat was the\r\nhouse-place; and it always gave notice to its mother when anybody came\r\nin, not by a cry, but by a crow. I lived for many months within hearing\r\nof that child, and never heard it cry day or night. I think there is a\r\ngreat deal too much of amusing children now, and not enough of letting\r\nthem amuse themselves.”\r\n\r\nWhat, again, could be more useful in its simplicity than the following,\r\naddressed to working mothers:—\r\n\r\n    “DEAR HARD-WORKING FRIENDS,—I am a hard-working woman too. May\r\n    I speak to you? And will you excuse me, though not a mother?\r\n\r\n    “You feel with me that every mother who brings a child into the\r\n    world has the duty laid upon her of bringing up the child in\r\n    such health as will enable him to do the work of his life.\r\n\r\n    “But though you toil all day for your children, and are so\r\n    devoted to them, this is not at all an easy task.\r\n\r\n    “We should not attempt to practise dressmaking, or any other\r\n    trade, without any training for it; but it is generally\r\n    impossible for a woman to get any teaching about the management\r\n    of health; yet health is to be learnt....\r\n\r\n    “The cottage homes of England are, after all, the most\r\n    important of the homes of any class; they should be pure in\r\n    every sense, pure in body and mind.\r\n\r\n    “Boys and girls must grow up healthy, with clean minds and\r\n    clean bodies and clean skins.\r\n\r\n    “And for this to be possible, the air, the earth, and the water\r\n    that they grow up in and have around them must be clean. Fresh\r\n    air, not bad air; clean earth, not foul earth; pure water,\r\n    not dirty water; and the first teachings and impressions that\r\n    they have at home must all be pure, and gentle, and firm. It\r\n    is home that teaches the child, after all, more than any other\r\n    schooling. A child learns before it is three whether it shall\r\n    obey its mother or not; and before it is seven, wise men tell\r\n    us that its character is formed.\r\n\r\n    “There is, too, another thing—orderliness. We know your daily\r\n    toil and love. May not the busiest and hardest life be somewhat\r\n    lightened, the day mapped out, so that each duty has the same\r\n    hours?...\r\n\r\n    “Think what enormous extra trouble it entails on mothers when\r\n    there is sickness. It is worth while to try to keep the family\r\n    in health, to prevent the sorrow, the anxiety, the trouble of\r\n    illness in the house, of which so much can be prevented.\r\n\r\n    “When a child has lost its health, how often the mother says,\r\n    ‘Oh, if I had only known! but there was no one to tell me. And\r\n    after all, it is health and not sickness that is our natural\r\n    state—the state that God intends for us. There are more people\r\n    to pick us up when we fall than to enable us to stand upon\r\n    our feet. God did not intend all mothers to be accompanied by\r\n    doctors, but He meant all children to be cared for by mothers.\r\n    God bless your work and labour of love.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Letter from Miss FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nDec 16/96 10 South Street Park Lane W\r\n\r\nDear Duke of Westminster\r\n\r\nGood speed to your noble effort in favour of District Nurses for town “&\r\nCountry”; and in Commemoration of our Queen who cares for all.\r\n\r\nWe look upon the District Nurse, if she is what she should be, & if we\r\ngive her the training she should have, as the great civilizer of the\r\npoor, training as well as nursing them out of ill health into good health\r\n(Health Missioness), out of drink into self control but all without\r\npreaching, without patronizing—as friends in sympathy.\r\n\r\nBut let them hold the standard high as Nurses.\r\n\r\nPray be sure I will try to help all I can, tho’ that be small, here I\r\nwill with your leave let you know.\r\n\r\nPray believe me your Grace’s faithful servant\r\n\r\nFlorence Nightingale]\r\n\r\nOr in a widely different field, in that fight against one of the most\r\nimportant causes of consumption, in which she was so far ahead of her\r\ntime, what could be more clear and convincing, both in knowledge and in\r\nreasoning, than the following analysis with regard to army barracks:—\r\n\r\n    “The cavalry barracks, as a whole, are the least overcrowded,\r\n    and have the freest external movement of air. Next come\r\n    the infantry; and the most crowded and the least ventilated\r\n    externally are the Guards’ barracks; _so that the mortality\r\n    from consumption, which follows the same order of increase in\r\n    the different arms, augments with increase of crowding and\r\n    difficulty of ventilation_.”[18]\r\n\r\nHer own well-trained mind was in extreme contrast with the type of mind\r\nwhich she describes in the following story:—\r\n\r\n    “I remember, when a child, hearing the story of an accident,\r\n    related by some one who sent two girls to fetch a ‘bottle of\r\n    sal volatile from her room.’ ‘Mary could not stir,’ she said;\r\n    ‘Fanny ran and fetched a bottle that was not sal volatile, and\r\n    that was not in my room.’”\r\n\r\nAll her teaching, so far as I know it, is clearly at first-hand and\r\ncarefully sifted. It is as far as possible from that useless kind of\r\ndoctrine which is a mere echo of unthinking hearsay. For instance, how\r\nmany sufferers she must have saved from unnecessary irritation by the\r\nfollowing reminder to nurses:—\r\n\r\n    “Of all parts of the body, the face is perhaps the one which\r\n    tells the least to the common observer or the casual visitor.\r\n\r\n    “I have known patients dying of sheer pain, exhaustion, and\r\n    want of sleep, from one of the most lingering and painful\r\n    diseases known, preserve, till within a few days of death,\r\n    not only the healthy colour of the cheek, but the mottled\r\n    appearance of a robust child. And scores of times have I heard\r\n    these unfortunate creatures assailed with, ‘I am glad to see\r\n    you looking so well.’ ‘I see no reason why you should not live\r\n    till ninety years of age.’ ‘Why don’t you take a little more\r\n    exercise and amusement?’—with all the other commonplaces with\r\n    which we are so familiar.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, how like her it is to remind those who are nursing that\r\n“a patient is not merely a piece of furniture, to be kept clean and\r\narranged against the wall, and saved from injury or breakage.”\r\n\r\nShe was one of the rare people who realized that truth of word is partly\r\na question of education, and that many people are quite unconscious of\r\ntheir lack of that difficult virtue. “I know I fibbs dreadful,” said a\r\npoor little servant girl to her once. “But believe me, miss, I never\r\nfinds out I have fibbed until they tell me so!” And her comment suggests\r\nthat in this matter that poor little servant girl by no means stood alone.\r\n\r\nShe worked very hard. Her books and pamphlets[19] were important, and her\r\ncorrespondence, ever dealing with the reforms she had at heart all over\r\nthe world, was of itself an immense output.\r\n\r\nThose who have had to write much from bed or sofa know only too well the\r\nabnormal fatigue it involves, and her labours of this kind seem to have\r\nbeen unlimited.\r\n\r\nHow strongly she sympathized with all municipal efforts, we see in many\r\nsuch letters as the one to General Evatt, given him for electioneering\r\npurposes, but not hitherto included in any biography, which we are\r\nallowed to reproduce here:—\r\n\r\n    “Strenuously desiring, as we all of us must, that\r\n    _Administration_ as well as Politics should be well represented\r\n    in Parliament, and that vital matters of social, sanitary,\r\n    and general interest should find their voice, we could desire\r\n    no better representative and advocate of these essential\r\n    matters—matters of life and death—than a man who, like\r\n    yourself, unites with almost exhaustless energy and public\r\n    spirit, sympathy with the wronged and enthusiasm with the\r\n    right, a persevering acuteness in unravelling the causes of the\r\n    evil and the good, large and varied experience and practical\r\n    power, limited only by the nature of the object for which it is\r\n    exerted.\r\n\r\n    “It is important beyond measure that such a man’s thoughtful\r\n    and well-considered opinions and energetic voice should be\r\n    heard in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n    “You have my warmest sympathy in your candidature for Woolwich,\r\n    my best wishes that you should succeed, even less for your\r\n    own sake than for that of Administration and of England.—Pray\r\n    believe me, ever your faithful servant,\r\n\r\n                                            “FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd also the following letter written to the Buckinghamshire County\r\nCouncil in 1892, begging them to appoint a sanitary committee:—\r\n\r\n    “We must create a public opinion which will drive the\r\n    Government, instead of the Government having to drive us—an\r\n    enlightened public opinion, wise in principles, wise in\r\n    details. We hail the County Council as being or becoming one\r\n    of the strongest engines in our favour, at once fathering and\r\n    obeying the great impulse for national health against national\r\n    and local disease. For we have learned that we have national\r\n    health in our own hands—local sanitation, national health.\r\n    But we have to contend against centuries of superstition and\r\n    generations of indifference. Let the County Council take the\r\n    lead.”\r\n\r\nAnd how justly, how clearly, she was able to weigh the work of those who\r\nhad borne the brunt of sanitary inquiry in the Crimea, with but little\r\nexcept kicks for their pains, may be judged by the following sentences\r\nfrom a letter to Lady Tulloch in 1878:—\r\n\r\n    “MY DEAR LADY TULLOCH,—I give you joy, I give you both joy, for\r\n    this crowning recognition of one of the noblest labours ever\r\n    done on earth. You yourself cannot cling to it more than I do;\r\n    hardly so much, in one sense, for I saw how Sir John MacNeill’s\r\n    and Sir A. Tulloch’s reporting was the salvation of the army in\r\n    the Crimea. Without them everything that happened would have\r\n    been considered ‘all right.’\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Martin’s note is perfect, for it does not look like an\r\n    afterthought, nor as prompted by others, but as the flow of a\r\n    generous and able man’s own reflection, and careful search into\r\n    authentic documents. Thank you again and again for sending it\r\n    to me. It is the greatest consolation I could have had. Will\r\n    you remember me gratefully to Mr. Paget, also to Dr. Balfour?\r\n    _I look back upon these twenty years as if they were yesterday,\r\n    but also as if they were a thousand years._ Success be with us\r\n    and the noble dead—and it has been success.—Yours ever,\r\n\r\n                                            “FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see from this letter how warmly the old memories dwelt with her, even\r\nwhile her hands were full of good work for the future.\r\n\r\nThe death of Lord Herbert in 1868 had been a blow that struck very deeply\r\nat her health and spirits.\r\n\r\nIn all her work of army reform she had looked up to him as her “Chief,”\r\nhardly realizing, perhaps, how much of the initiating had been her own.\r\nTheir friendship, too, had been almost lifelong, and in every way ideal.\r\nThe whole nation mourned his loss, but only the little intimate group\r\nwhich centred in his wife and children and those dearest friends, of whom\r\nMiss Nightingale was one, knew fully all that the country had lost in him.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while for a double reason to quote here from Mr.\r\nGladstone’s tribute at a meeting held to decide on a memorial.\r\n\r\n    “To him,” said Gladstone, “we owe the commission for inquiry\r\n    into barracks and hospitals; to him we are indebted for the\r\n    reorganization of the medical department of the army. To him\r\n    we owe the commission of inquiry into, and remodelling the\r\n    medical education of, the army. And, lastly, we owe him the\r\n    commission for presenting to the public the vital statistics of\r\n    the army in such a form, from time to time, that the great and\r\n    living facts of the subject are brought to view.”\r\n\r\nLord Herbert had toiled with ever-deepening zeal to reform the unhealthy\r\nconditions to which, even in times of peace, our soldiers had been\r\nexposed—so unhealthy that, while the mortality lists showed a death\r\nof eight in every thousand for civilians, for soldiers the number of\r\ndeaths was seventeen per thousand. And of every two deaths in the army\r\nit was asserted that one was preventable. Lord Herbert was the heart\r\nand soul of the Royal Commission to inquire into these preventable\r\ncauses, and through his working ardour the work branched forth into four\r\nsupplementary commissions concerning hospitals and barracks. When he\r\ndied, Miss Nightingale not only felt the pang of parting from one of her\r\noldest and most valued friends, but she also felt that in this cause,\r\nso specially dear to her heart, she had lost a helper who could never be\r\nreplaced, though she dauntlessly stood to her task and helped to carry on\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n    _Multifarious work and many honours—Jubilee Nurses—Nursing\r\n    Association—Death of father and mother—Lady Verney and her\r\n    husband—No respecter of persons—From within four walls—South\r\n    Africa and America._\r\n\r\n\r\nHer activities were so multitudinous that it is difficult even to name\r\nthem all in such a brief sketch as this. Besides those at which we have\r\nalready glanced, prison reform, help to Bosnian fugitives, Manchester\r\nPolice Court Mission for Lads, Indian Famine Fund—merely glancing\r\ndown two pages of her biography, I find all these mentioned. She was\r\nherself, of course, decorated with the Red Cross, but M. Henri Dunant’s\r\nmagnificent Red Cross scheme for helping the wounded on the battlefield\r\nmay be said to have been really the outcome of her own work and example.\r\nFor it was the extension of her own activities, by means of the Red\r\nCross Societies, which throughout the European continent act in concert\r\nwith their respective armies and governments.\r\n\r\nShe was the first woman to be decorated with the Order of Merit, which\r\nwas bestowed on her in 1907, and in the following year she received,\r\nas the Baroness Burdett Coutts had done, the “Freedom of the City of\r\nLondon,” having already been awarded, among many like honours, the French\r\nGold Medal of Secours aux blessés Militaires, and the German Order of\r\nthe Cross of Merit. On May 10, 1910, she received the badge of honour of\r\nthe Norwegian Red Cross Society. But there was another distinction, even\r\nmore unique, which was already hers. For when £70,000 came into Queen\r\nVictoria’s hands as a gift from the women of her empire at the time of\r\nher Jubilee, so much had the Queen been impressed by the work of the\r\nNursing Association and all that had been done for the sick poor, that\r\nthe interest of this Women’s Jubilee Fund, £2,000 a year, was devoted to\r\nan Institution for Training and Maintaining Nurses for the Sick Poor; and\r\nthe National Association for Providing Trained Nurses, which owed so\r\nmuch to Miss Nightingale, was affiliated with it, though it still keeps\r\nits old headquarters at 23 Bloomsbury Square, where for so many years\r\nwould arrive at Christmas from her old home a consignment of beautiful\r\nholly and other evergreens for Christmas festivities. H.R.H. the Princess\r\nChristian is President of the Nursing Association, and Miss Nightingale’s\r\nold friend and fellow-worker, Mr. Henry Bonham Carter, is the Secretary.\r\nThe influence of Miss Florence Lees, described by Kinglake as “the gifted\r\nand radiant pupil of Florence Nightingale,” who afterwards became Mrs.\r\nDacre Craven, and was the first Superintendent-General, has been a very\r\nvitalizing influence there, and the home owes much also to her husband,\r\nthe Rev. Dacre Craven, of St. Andrew’s, Holborn. Miss Nightingale’s warm\r\nfriendship for Miss Florence Lees brought her into peculiarly intimate\r\nrelations with the home, and both the Association and the Queen’s Jubilee\r\nInstitute are the fruit of Miss Nightingale’s teaching, and a noble\r\ndouble memorial of the national—nay, imperial—recognition of its value.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Pension Fund for Nurses also, in which Queen Alexandra\r\nwas so specially interested, helped to crown the fulfilment of Miss\r\nNightingale’s early dream and long, steadfast life-work.\r\n\r\nBut equally important, though less striking, has been the growing harvest\r\nof her quiet, courteous efforts to help village mothers to understand\r\nthe laws of health, her pioneer-work in regard to all the dangers of\r\ncareless milk-farms, her insistence on the importance of pure air as\r\nwell as pure water, though she had always been careful to treat the poor\r\nman’s rooftree as his castle and never to cross his doorstep except by\r\npermission or invitation.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her father at Embley in 1874—a very peaceful death,\r\ncommemorated in the inscription on his tomb, “In Thy light we shall see\r\nlight,” which suggests in him a nature at once devout and sincere—she was\r\nmuch with her mother, in the old homes at Embley and Lea Hurst, though\r\nLea Hurst was the one she loved best, and the beech-wood walk in Lea\r\nWoods, with its radiant shower of golden leaves in the autumn, for which\r\nshe would sometimes delay her leaving, is still specially associated with\r\nher memory: and her thoughtfulness for the poor still expressed itself in\r\nmany different ways—in careful gifts, for instance, through one whom she\r\ntrusted for knowledge and tact; in her arrangement that pure milk should\r\nbe sent daily from the home dairy at Lea Hurst to those in need of it.\r\n\r\nWith faithful love she tended her mother to the time of her death in\r\n1880, and there seems to be a joyous thanksgiving for that mother’s\r\nbeauty of character in the words the two sisters inscribed to her memory:\r\n“God is love—Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.”\r\n\r\nAfter her mother’s death, when the property had passed into the hands of\r\nMr. William Shore Nightingale, she still visited her kinsman there and\r\nkept up her interest in the people of the district.\r\n\r\nAmong the outward events of her life, after her return from the Crimea,\r\none of the earliest had been the marriage of her sister Parthenope, who\r\nin 1858 became the second wife of Sir Harry Verney,[20] and her home\r\nat Claydon in Buckinghamshire was thenceforth a second home to Miss\r\nNightingale. It need hardly be said that in Sir Harry Verney’s various\r\ngenerous schemes for the good of the neighbourhood, schemes in which his\r\nwife cordially co-operated, Miss Nightingale took a warm and sympathetic\r\npleasure. His keen interest in army reform was, of course, a special\r\nground of comradeship. Miss Nightingale divided her time chiefly between\r\nher own home in South Street, Park Lane, and visits to the rooms that\r\nwere reserved for her at Claydon. One of her great interests while at\r\nClaydon, soon after her sister’s marriage, had been the building of the\r\nnew Buckinghamshire Infirmary in 1861, of which her sister laid the\r\nfoundation; and her bust still adorns the entrance hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tooley reminds us that not only was Lady Verney well known in\r\nliterary and political circles, but also her books on social questions\r\nhad the distinction of being quoted in the House of Commons. She gives\r\nmany interesting details with regard to the philanthropic and political\r\nwork of Sir Harry Verney and his family, but it is hardly necessary to\r\nduplicate them here, since her book is still available. Lady Verney’s\r\ndeath in 1890, after a long and painful illness, following on that of her\r\nfather and mother, bereaved Miss Nightingale of a lifelong companionship,\r\nand might have left her very lonely but for her absorbing work and her\r\ntroops of friends.\r\n\r\nHow fruitful that work was we may dimly see when we remember that—to\r\ninstance one branch of it only—in ten years the death-rate in the army\r\nin India, which her efforts so determinately strove to lessen, fell from\r\nsixty-nine per thousand to eighteen per thousand.[21] She strove—and not\r\nin vain—to improve the sanitary conditions of immense areas of undrained\r\ncountry, but she also endeavoured to bring home to the rank and file of\r\nthe army individual teaching.\r\n\r\nShe gives in one of her pamphlets a delightful story of men who came to\r\na district in India supposed to be fatal to any new-comer, but, strong\r\nin their new hygienic knowledge, determined _not_ to have cholera. They\r\nlived carefully, they grew their own garden produce, they did not give\r\nway to fear, and _all_, without exception, escaped.\r\n\r\nTo return for a moment to Britain, since a separate chapter is reserved\r\nfor India. She was before her day in contending that foul air was one\r\nof the great causes of consumption and other diseases. And her teaching\r\nwas ever given with courtesy and consideration. How strongly she felt\r\non this and kindred subjects, and how practical her help was, we see\r\nclearly in her letters and pamphlets. She delighted in making festivities\r\nfor companies of nurses and of her other hard-working friends. And in\r\nSt. Paul’s fine sense of the phrase, she was no “respecter of persons”:\r\nshe reverenced personality, not accidental rank. She had no patience\r\nwith those visiting ladies who think they may intrude at all hours\r\nof the day into the homes of the poor, and her quick sense of humour\r\ndelighted in many of the odd speeches which would have shocked the prim\r\nand conventional. She thought the highest compliment ever paid to her\r\nstaff of nurses who visited in the homes of the poor was the speech of\r\nthe grubby ragamuffin, who seemed to think they could wash off even the\r\nblackness of the Arch-fiend and, when being scrubbed, cried out, “You may\r\nbathe the divil.”\r\n\r\nBut with all her fun and relish of life, how sane, how practical, she was!\r\n\r\nDo you remember how she laughed at the silly idea that nothing was needed\r\nto make a good nurse except what the “Early Victorian” used to call “a\r\ndisappointment in love”?\r\n\r\nHere are other of her shrewd sayings from her _Nursing Notes_:—\r\n\r\n    “Another extraordinary fallacy is the dread of night air.\r\n    What air can we breathe at night but night air? The choice\r\n    is between pure night air from without and foul air from\r\n    within. Most people prefer the latter.... Without cleanliness\r\n    within and without your house, ventilation is comparatively\r\n    useless.... And now, you think these things trifles, or at\r\n    least exaggerated. But what you ‘think’ or what I ‘think’\r\n    matters little. Let us see what God thinks of them. God\r\n    always justifies His ways. While we are thinking, He has been\r\n    teaching. I have known cases of hospital pyæmia quite as severe\r\n    in handsome private houses as in any of the worst hospitals,\r\n    and from the same cause—viz., foul air. Yet nobody learnt the\r\n    lesson. Nobody learnt _anything_ at all from it. They went on\r\n    _thinking_—thinking that the sufferer had scratched his thumb,\r\n    or that it was singular that ‘all the servants’ had ‘whitlows,’\r\n    or that something was ‘much about this year.’”\r\n\r\nIf there had been any hope at first that Miss Nightingale might grow\r\nstrong enough to stand visibly among those who were being trained as\r\nnurses by the fund raised in her honour, that hope was now past, and when\r\nthe great new wing of St. Thomas’s was built—the finest building for its\r\npurpose in Europe—the outward reins of government had to be delivered\r\nover into the hands of another, though hers was throughout the directing\r\nhand. And the results of her work are written in big type upon the page\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nIn India and America she is acclaimed as an adored benefactress, but\r\nwhat has she not done for our own country alone? To sum up even a few of\r\nthe points on which I have touched: she initiated sick nursing among the\r\npoor, through her special appeal was built the Central Home for Nurses,\r\nshe was the pioneer in the hygienic work of county councils, and, besides\r\nthe great nursing school at St. Thomas’s, to her was largely due the\r\nreform of nursing in workhouses and infirmaries. And in 1890, with the\r\n£70,000 of the Women’s Jubilee Fund, the establishment of the Queen’s\r\nNurses received its charter.\r\n\r\nIn affairs of military nursing it is no exaggeration to say that she\r\nwas consulted throughout the world. America came to her in the Civil\r\nWar; South Africa owed much to her; India infinitely more; and so vital\r\nhave been the reforms introduced by Lord Herbert and herself that even\r\nas early as 1880, when General Gordon was waging war in China during\r\nthe Taiping Rebellion, the death-rate as compared with the Crimea was\r\nreduced from sixty per cent. to little more than three in every hundred\r\nyearly.[22]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, though she was so much more seriously broken in health\r\nthan any one at first realized, that did not prevent her incessant work,\r\nthough it did in the end make her life more or less a hidden life, spent\r\nwithin four walls, and chiefly on her bed.\r\n\r\nYet from those four walls what electric messages of help and common sense\r\nwere continuously flashing across the length and breadth of the world!\r\nShe was regarded as an expert in her own subjects, and long before her\r\nJubilee Fund enabled her to send forth the Queen’s Nurses, she was, as we\r\nhave already seen, busy writing and working to improve not only nursing\r\nin general, but especially the nursing of the sick poor; and unceasingly\r\nshe still laboured for the army.\r\n\r\nRepeated mention has been made of General Evatt, to whose memory of Miss\r\nNightingale I am much indebted.\r\n\r\nGeneral Evatt served in the last Afghan campaign, and what he there\r\nexperienced determined him to seek an interview, as soon as he returned\r\nto England, with her whom he regarded as the great reformer of military\r\nhygiene—Florence Nightingale. In this way and on this subject there arose\r\nbetween them a delightful and enduring friendship. Many and many a time\r\nin that quiet room in South Street where she lay upon her bed—its dainty\r\ncoverlet all strewn with the letters and papers that might have befitted\r\nthe desk or office of a busy statesman, and surrounded by books and by\r\nthe flowers that she loved so well—he had talked with her for four hours\r\non end, admiring with a sort of wonder her great staying power and her\r\nbig, untiring brain.\r\n\r\nHe did not, like another acquaintance of mine, say that he came away\r\nfeeling like a sucked orange, with all hoarded knowledge on matters great\r\nand small gently, resistlessly drawn from him by his charming companion;\r\nbut so voracious was the eager, sympathetic interest of Miss Nightingale\r\nin the men and women of that active world whose streets, at the time he\r\nlearned to know her, she no longer walked, that no conversation on human\r\naffairs ever seemed, he said, to tire her.\r\n\r\nAnd her mind was ever working towards new measures for the health and\r\nuplifting of her fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how eager she was to use for good every municipal\r\nopportunity, but she did not stop at the municipality, for she knew that\r\nthere are many womanly duties also at the imperial hearth; and without\r\nentering on any controversy, it is necessary to state clearly that she\r\nvery early declared herself in favour of household suffrage for women,\r\nand that “the North of England Society for Women’s Suffrage is the proud\r\npossessor of her signature to an address to Mr. Disraeli, thanking him\r\nfor his favourable vote in the House of Commons, and begging him to\r\ndo his utmost to remove the injustice under which women householders\r\nsuffered by being deprived of the parliamentary vote.”[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale’s London House, 10 South Street, Park\r\nLane (house with balcony), where she died, August 14, 1910.]\r\n\r\nWhatever could aid womanly service—as a voice in choosing our great\r\ndomestic executive nowadays undoubtedly can—had her sympathy and\r\ninterest; but what she emphasized most, I take it, at all times, was that\r\nwhen any door opened for service, woman should be not only willing, but\r\nalso nobly _efficient_. She herself opened many such doors, and her lamp\r\nwas always trimmed and filled and ready to give light and comfort in the\r\ndarkest room.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said that in describing a friend in the following words,\r\nshe unconsciously drew a picture of herself:—\r\n\r\n    “She had the gracefulness, the wit, the unfailing\r\n    cheerfulness—qualities so remarkable, but so much overlooked,\r\n    in our Saviour’s life. She had the absence of all\r\n    ‘mortification’ for mortification’s sake, which characterized\r\n    His work, and any real work in the present day as in His day.\r\n    And how did she do all this?... She was always filled with the\r\n    thought that she must be about her Father’s business.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n    _India—Correspondence with Sir Bartle Frere—Interest in village\r\n    girls—The Lamp._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to Miss Nightingale’s most monumental achievement of all,\r\nthe reform of sanitary conditions in India—a reform ever widening and\r\ndeveloping, branching forth and striking its roots deeper. Her interest\r\nin that vast population, that world-old treasury of subtle religious\r\nthought and ever-present mystical faith, may perhaps have been in part an\r\ninheritance from the Anglo-Indian Governor who was counted in her near\r\nancestry. But there can be little doubt that her ardent and practical\r\ndesire to improve the conditions of camp life in India began in her\r\nintimate care for the soldiers, and her close knowledge of many things\r\nunknown to the ordinary English subject. The world-wide freemasonry of\r\nthe rank and file in our army enabled her to hear while at Scutari much\r\nof the life of the army in the vast and distant dominions of Burma and\r\nBengal, and she had that gift for seeing through things to their farthest\r\nroots which enabled her to perceive clearly that no mere mending of camp\r\nconditions could stay the continual ravages of disease among our men.\r\nThe evil was deeper and wider, and only as conditions were improved in\r\nsanitary matters could the mortality of the army be lessened. She saw,\r\nand saw clearly, that the reason children died like flies in India, so\r\nthat those who loved them best chose the agony of years of parting rather\r\nthan take the risks, lay not so much in the climate as in the human\r\npoisons and putrefactions so carelessly treated and so quickly raised to\r\nmurder-power by the extreme heat.\r\n\r\nMuch of this comes out clearly in her letter to Sir Bartle Frere, with\r\nwhom her first ground of friendship had arisen out of their common\r\ninterest in sanitary matters.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of man Sir Bartle was may be divined from a letter to him\r\nwritten by Colonel W. F. Marriott, one of the secretaries of the Bombay\r\nGovernment, at the time of his leaving Bombay:—\r\n\r\n    “The scene of your departure stirred me much. That bright\r\n    evening, the crowd on the pier and shore as the boat put\r\n    off, the music from the _Octavia_, as the band played ‘Auld\r\n    Lang Syne’ as we passed, were all typical and impressive by\r\n    association of ideas. But it was not a shallow sympathy with\r\n    which I took in all the circumstances. I could divine some of\r\n    your thoughts. If I felt like Sir Bedivere, left behind ‘among\r\n    new men, strange faces, other minds,’ you must have felt in\r\n    some degree like King Arthur in the barge, ‘I have lived my\r\n    life, and that which I have done may He Himself make pure.’\r\n    I do not doubt that you felt that all this ‘mouth honour’ is\r\n    only worth so far as it is the seal of one’s own approving\r\n    conscience, and though you could accept it freely as deserved\r\n    from their lips, yet at that hour you judged your own work\r\n    hardly. You measured the palpable results with your conceptions\r\n    and hopes, and were inclined to say, ‘I am no better than my\r\n    fathers.’ But I, judging now calmly and critically, feel—I may\r\n    say, see—that though the things that seem to have failed be\r\n    amongst those for which you have taken most pains, yet they\r\n    are small things compared with the work which has not failed.\r\n    You have made an impression of earnest human sympathy with the\r\n    people of this country, which will deepen and expand, so that\r\n    it will be felt as a perpetual witness against any narrower\r\n    and less noble conception of our relation to them, permanently\r\n    raising the moral standard of highest policy towards them;\r\n    and your name will become a traditional embodiment of a good\r\n    governor.”[24]\r\n\r\nFrere had seen that the filthy condition of many of the roads, after\r\nthe passing of animals and the failure to cleanse from manure, was of\r\nitself a source of poison, though the relation between garbage and\r\ndisease-bearing flies was then less commonly understood, and he was never\r\ntired of urging the making of decent roads; but this, he knew, was only\r\na very small part of the improvements needed.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence with Miss Nightingale began in 1867, and in that\r\nand the five following years they exchanged about one hundred letters,\r\nchiefly on sanitary questions.\r\n\r\nIt was part of her genius always to see and seize her opportunity, and\r\nshe rightly thought that, as she says in one of her letters, “We might\r\nnever have such a favourable conjunction of the larger planets again:\r\n\r\n“You, who are willing and most able to organize the machinery here; Sir\r\nJohn Lawrence, who is able and willing, provided only he knew what to do;\r\nand a Secretary of State who is willing and in earnest. And I believe\r\nnothing would bring them to their senses in India more than an annual\r\nreport of what they have done, with your comments upon it, laid before\r\nParliament.”\r\n\r\nIn order to set in motion the machinery of a sanitary department for all\r\nIndia, a despatch had to be written, pointing out clearly and concisely\r\nwhat was to be done.\r\n\r\nFrere consulted Miss Nightingale at every point about this despatch,\r\nbut spoke of the necessity for some sort of peg to hang it on—“not,” he\r\nsaid, “that the Secretary of State is at all lukewarm, nor, I think, that\r\nhe has any doubt as to what should be said, or how—that, I think, your\r\nmemoranda have fixed; the only difficulty is as to the when....\r\n\r\n“No governor-general, I believe, since the time of Clive has had such\r\npowers and such opportunities, but he fancies the want of progress is\r\nowing to some opposing power which does not exist anywhere but in his own\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n“He cannot see that perpetual inspection by the admiral of the drill and\r\nkit of every sailor is not the way to make the fleet efficient, and he\r\ngets disheartened and depressed because he finds that months and years of\r\nthis squirrel-like activity lead to no real progress.”\r\n\r\nThe despatch with its accompanying documents went to Miss Nightingale for\r\nher remarks before it was sent out. Her commentary was as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “I find nothing to add or to take away in the memorandum\r\n    (sanitary). It appears to me quite perfect in itself—that is,\r\n    it is quite as much as the enemy will bear, meaning by the\r\n    enemy—not at all the Government of India in India, still less\r\n    the Government of India at home, but—that careless and ignorant\r\n    person called the Devil, who is always walking about taking\r\n    knowledge out of people’s heads, who said that he was coming to\r\n    give us the knowledge of good and evil, and who has done just\r\n    the contrary.\r\n\r\n    “It is a noble paper, an admirable paper—and what a present to\r\n    make to a government! You have included in it all the great\r\n    principles—sanitary and administrative—which the country\r\n    requires. And now you must work, work these points until they\r\n    are embodied in local works in India. This will not be in our\r\n    time, for it takes more than a few years to fill a continent\r\n    with civilization. But I never despair that in God’s good time\r\n    every man of us will reap the common benefit of obeying all the\r\n    laws which He has given us for our well-being.\r\n\r\n    “I shall give myself the pleasure of writing to you again about\r\n    these papers. But I write this note merely to say that I don’t\r\n    think this memorandum requires any addition.\r\n\r\n    “God bless you for it! I think it is a great work.”[25]\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a great work, and it might have been delayed for scores of\r\nyears, with a yearly unnecessary waste of thousands of lives, if she had\r\nnot initiated it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Florence Nightingale in her Last Days.\r\n\r\n(_From a drawing from memory. Copyright A. Rischgitz._)]\r\n\r\nHer words to Sir Bartle Frere at the outset had been: “It does seem that\r\nthere is no element in the scheme of government (of India) by which the\r\npublic health can be taken care of. And the thing is now to create such\r\nan element.”\r\n\r\nAs early as 1863, in her “Observations on the Sanitary State of the Army\r\nin India,” she had written:—\r\n\r\n    “Native ‘caste’ prejudices appear to have been made the excuse\r\n    for European laziness, as far as regards our sanitary and\r\n    hospital neglects of the natives. Recent railroad experience is\r\n    a striking proof that ‘caste,’ in their minds, is no bar to\r\n    intercommunication in arrangements tending to their benefit.”\r\n\r\nSir C. Trevelyan justly says that “a good sanitary state of the military\r\nforce cannot be secured without making similar arrangements for the\r\npopulations settled in and around the military cantonments; that sanitary\r\nreform must be generally introduced into India for the civil as well as\r\nthe military portion of the community.”\r\n\r\nAnd now that the opportunity arrived, all was done with wise and swift\r\ndiplomacy. The way was smoothed by a call from Frere on his old friend\r\nSir Richard Temple, at that time Finance Minister at Calcutta, asking him\r\nto help.\r\n\r\nThose who know India best, and know Miss Nightingale best, are those who\r\nare most aware of the mighty tree of ever-widening health improvement\r\nthat grew from this little seed, and of the care with which Miss\r\nNightingale helped to guard and foster it.\r\n\r\n“She was a great Indian,” her friend General Evatt repeated to me more\r\nthan once, “and what a head she had! She was the only human being I\r\nhave ever met, for instance, man or woman, who had thoroughly mastered\r\nthe intricate details of the Bengal land-purchase system. She loved\r\nIndia, and she knew it through and through. It was no wonder that every\r\ndistinguished Indian who came to England went to see Miss Nightingale.”\r\n\r\nShe bore her ninety years very lightly, and made a vision serene and\r\nnoble, as will be seen from our picture, though that does not give the\r\nlovely youthful colouring in contrast with the silvery hair, and we read\r\nof the great expressiveness of her hands, which, a little more, perhaps,\r\nthan is usual with Englishwomen, she used in conversation.\r\n\r\nIt was a very secluded life that she lived at No. 10 South Street; but\r\nshe was by no means without devotees, and the bouquet that the German\r\nEmperor sent her was but one of many offerings from many high-hearted\r\nwarriors at her shrine.\r\n\r\nAnd when she visited her old haunts at Lea Hurst and Embley she delighted\r\nin sending invitations to the girls growing up in those village families\r\nthat she had long counted among her friends, so that to her tea-table\r\nwere lovingly welcomed guests very lowly, as well as those better known\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nHer intense and sympathetic interest in all the preparations for nursing\r\nin the South African campaign has already been touched upon, as well as\r\nher joy that some of her own nurses from among the first probationers at\r\nSt. Thomas’s were accepted in that enterprise with praise and gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt would be a serious omission not to refer my readers to a very moving\r\nletter which she wrote to Cavaliere Sebastiano Fenzi, during the Italian\r\nWar of Independence in 1866, of which a part is given in Mrs. Tooley’s\r\nbook, and from which I am permitted to quote the following:—\r\n\r\n    “I have given dry advice as dryly as I could. But you must\r\n    permit me to say that if there is anything I could do for you\r\n    at any time, and you would command me, I should esteem it\r\n    the greatest honour and pleasure. I am a hopeless invalid,\r\n    entirely a prisoner to my room, and overwhelmed with business.\r\n    Otherwise how gladly would I answer to your call and come and\r\n    do my little best for you in the dear city where I was born. If\r\n    the giving my miserable life could hasten your success but by\r\n    half an hour, how gladly would I give it!”\r\n\r\nHow far she was ahead of her time becomes every day more obvious; for\r\nevery day the results of her teaching are gradually making themselves\r\nfelt. For example, it can no longer, without qualification, be said,\r\nas she so truly said in her own day, that while “the coxcombries of\r\neducation are taught to every schoolgirl” there is gross ignorance, not\r\nonly among schoolgirls, but also even among mothers and nurses, with\r\nregard to “those laws which God has assigned to the relations of our\r\nbodies with the world in which He has put them. In other words, the laws\r\nwhich make these bodies, into which He has put our minds, healthy or\r\nunhealthy organs of those minds, are all but unlearnt. Not but that these\r\nlaws—the laws of life—are in a certain measure understood, but not even\r\nmothers think it worth their while to study them—to study how to give\r\ntheir children healthy existences. They call it medical or physiological\r\nknowledge, fit only for doctors.”\r\n\r\nIn her old age, loved and honoured far and wide, she toiled on with all\r\nthe warm enthusiasm of a girl, and the ripe wisdom of fourscore years and\r\nten spent in the service of her one Master, for she was not of those who\r\never tried to serve two. And when she died at No. 10 South Street, on\r\nAugust 10, 1910—so peacefully that the tranquil glow of sunset descended\r\nupon her day of harvest—the following beautiful incident was recorded in\r\n_Nursing Notes_, to whose editor I am specially indebted for bringing to\r\nmy notice the verses in which the story is told[26]:—\r\n\r\n    “At Chelsea, under the lime tree’s stir,\r\n    I read the news to a pensioner\r\n    That a noble lord and a judge were dead—\r\n    ‘They were younger men than me,’ he said.\r\n\r\n    “I read again of another death;\r\n    The old man turned, and caught his breath—\r\n    ‘She’s gone?’ he said; ‘she too? In camp\r\n    We called her the Lady of the Lamp.’\r\n\r\n    “He would not listen to what I read,\r\n    But wanted it certain—‘The Lady’s dead?’\r\n    I showed it him to remove his doubt,\r\n    And added, unthinking, ‘The Lamp is out.’\r\n\r\n    “He rose—and I had to help him stand—\r\n    Then, as he saluted with trembling hand,\r\n    I was abashed to hear him say,\r\n    ‘The Lamp she lit is alight to-day.’”\r\n\r\n                                       F. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n    _A brief summing up._\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who write of Florence Nightingale sentimentally, as though she\r\nspent herself in a blind, caressing tenderness, would have earned her\r\nsecret scorn, not unflavoured by a jest; for she stood always at the\r\nopposite pole from the sentimentalists, and perhaps had a little of her\r\nfather in her—that father who, when he was _giving_ right and left, would\r\nsay to some plausible beggar of society who came to him for wholesale\r\nsubscriptions, “You see, I was not born generous,” well knowing that his\r\nideas of generosity and theirs differed by a whole heaven, and that his\r\nwere the wider and the more generous of the two.\r\n\r\nShe had a will of iron. That is what one of her greatest admirers has\r\nmore than once said to me—and he knew her well. No doubt it was true.\r\nOnly a will of iron could have enabled a delicate woman to serve, for\r\ntwenty hours at a time, with unwearying tenderness and courage among\r\nthe wounded and the dying. Even her iron resolution and absolute\r\nfearlessness could not prevent her from taking Crimean fever when she\r\ninsisted on visiting a second time the lonely typhus patient outside\r\nBalaclava, at a moment when she was worn out with six months of nursing\r\nand administration combined. But it did enable her to go back to her post\r\nwhen barely recovered, and, later in life, even when a prisoner within\r\nfour walls, who seldom left her bed, that will of iron did enable her to\r\ngo on labouring till the age of ninety, and to fulfil for the good of\r\nmankind the dearest purpose of her heart. Nothing is harder than iron,\r\nand that which is made of it after it has been through the furnace has\r\nlong been the very symbol of loyalty and uprightness when we say of a man\r\nthat he is “true as steel.”\r\n\r\nYes, iron is hard and makes a pillar of strength in time of need. But\r\nhe who forges out of it weapons and tools that are at once delicate\r\nand resistless, knows that it will humbly shoe the feet of horses, and\r\ncut the household bread, and will make for others besides Lombardy a\r\nkingly crown. And when iron is truly on fire, nothing commoner or softer\r\nnor anything more yielding—not even gold itself—can glow with a more\r\nsteadfast and fervent heat to warm the hands and hearts of men.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Miss Nightingale that dwells in the popular mind no\r\ndoubt owes its outline to the memories of the men she nursed with such\r\ntenderness and skill. And it is a true picture. Like all good workmen,\r\nshe loved her work, and nursing was her chosen work so long as her\r\nstrength remained. None can read her writing, and especially her _Nursing\r\nNotes_ and her pamphlet on nursing among the sick poor, without feeling\r\nhow much she cared for every minutest detail, and how sensitively she\r\nfelt with, and for, her patients.\r\n\r\nBut such a picture, as will have been made clear by this time, shows only\r\none aspect of her life-work. One of her nearest intimates writes to me of\r\nher difficulties in reforming military hospitals, and her determination\r\ntherefore to give herself later in life to the reform of civilian\r\nnursing; but in reality she did both, for through the one she indirectly\r\ninfluenced the other, and began what has been widening and unfolding in\r\nevery direction ever since.\r\n\r\nThose who knew her best speak almost with awe of her constructive and\r\norganizing power. She was indeed a pioneer and a leader, and girt about\r\nwith the modesty of all true greatness.\r\n\r\nLike Joan of Arc, she heeded not the outward voices, but, through all\r\nfaults and sorrows, sought to follow always and only the voice of the\r\nDivine One. This gave her life unity and power. And when she passed on\r\ninto the life beyond, the door opened and closed again very quietly,\r\nleaving the whole world the better for her ninety years in our midst.\r\n“When I have done with this old suit,” says George Meredith, “so much in\r\nneed of mending;” but hers, like his, was a very charming suit to the\r\nlast, and even to the end of her ninety years the colouring was clear and\r\nfresh as a girl’s.\r\n\r\nLike all strong, true, disinterested people, she made enemies—where is\r\nthere any sanitary reformer who does not?—yet seldom indeed has any one,\r\nman or woman, won deeper and more world-wide love. But that was not her\r\naim; her aim was to do the will of her Commander and leave the world\r\nbetter than she found it.\r\n\r\nSeldom has there been a moment when women have more needed the counsel\r\ngiven in one of the letters here published for the first time, when\r\nshe begs of a dear friend that her name may be that “of one who obeys\r\nauthority, however unreasonable, in the name of Him who is above all, and\r\nwho is Reason itself.”\r\n\r\nAnd as we think of the debt the world owes to Florence Nightingale and of\r\nall she did for England, for India, and not only for the British Empire,\r\nbut for the world, we may well pause for a moment on the words that\r\nclosed our opening chapter, in which she begs her fellow-workers to give\r\nup considering their actions in any light of rivalry as between men and\r\nwomen, and ends with an entreaty:—\r\n\r\n    “It does not make a thing good, that it is remarkable that a\r\n    woman should have been able to do it. Neither does it make a\r\n    thing bad, which would have been good had a man done it, that\r\n    it has been done by a woman.\r\n\r\n    “Oh, leave these jargons, and go your way straight to God’s\r\n    work, in simplicity and singleness of heart.”\r\n\r\nThe well-remembered words of Ruskin’s appeal to girls in “Sesame and\r\nLilies,” published but a few years earlier, were evidently in Miss\r\nNightingale’s mind when she wrote the closing sentences of her tribute\r\nto Agnes Jones—sentences which set their seal upon this volume, and will\r\necho long after it is forgotten.\r\n\r\n    “Let us,” she writes, “add living flowers to her grave, ‘lilies\r\n    with full hands,’ not fleeting primroses, nor dying flowers.\r\n    Let us bring the work of our hands and our heads and our\r\n    hearts to finish her work which God has so blessed. Let us not\r\n    merely rest in peace, but let hers be the life which stirs up\r\n    to fight the good fight against vice and sin and misery and\r\n    wretchedness, as she did—the call to arms which she was ever\r\n    obeying:—\r\n\r\n        ‘The Son of God goes forth to war—\r\n          Who follows in His train?’\r\n\r\n    “O daughters of God, are there so few to answer?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS BY FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE.\r\n\r\nLetter (on the Madras Famine): The Great Lesson of the Indian Famine,\r\netc. 1877.\r\n\r\nLife or Death in India.
