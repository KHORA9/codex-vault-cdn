HAYDEN,\r\n                   Little College Street, Westminster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The observations and reflections contained in the following pages, are\r\nthe results of several autumnal excursions in the line of the German\r\nSpas, undertaken partly for health, partly for recreation, and partly for\r\ninformation on a subject that now interests a large portion of English\r\ninvalids. The contents of the volume are like the objects which gave\r\nit origin. They are miscellaneous—and probably this character will be\r\nobjected to, on the principle, “ne sutor ultra crepidam.” I have yet\r\nto learn, however, why a physician should be debarred from indulgence\r\nin general observations or reflections, and confined exclusively to\r\nprofessional topics. His education, habits of thought, and knowledge\r\nof human nature do not particularly disqualify him for a task which is\r\ndaily undertaken by people of all grades of acquirement, and degrees of\r\nability. The truth is, that being too independent to write for the mere\r\npurpose of catching the approbation of others, I have followed the bent\r\nof my own inclinations, and, if taken to task by censors, have little\r\nother reason to offer for my conduct than the old one—“stat pro ratione\r\nvoluntas.”_\r\n\r\n_There is one portion of the book, however, (a very small one, some\r\ntwenty pages of letter-press) which may require some apology. The course\r\nof the Rhine leads to most of the German Spas, and is therefore traversed\r\nannually by multitudes of invalids as well as tourists. Every castle and\r\npromontory on its banks has its legend, and these traditions contribute\r\nto fix the picture of the locality in the mind’s eye, by association,\r\nfor ever afterwards. In one of my excursions, some years ago, it struck\r\nme that these legends were ~designed~, originally, each to convey some\r\nmoral precept—at all events, I became convinced that they were ~capable~\r\nof being ~moralized~. Under this impression, I condensed the principal\r\ntraditionary tales that have their ~locale~ in sight of the voyager, and\r\ndeduced what I considered to be the moral or useful precepts which they\r\nconcealed under a wild and improbable fiction. If I have failed in this\r\nattempt, the intention, at least, was good. Throughout the whole volume,\r\nmy object has been to compress into small space much useful information\r\nfor invalid or tourist, and, on all occasions, to start subjects for\r\nmeditation or reflection, well knowing, from long experience, that such\r\noccupations of the mind on a journey, are eminently conducive both to\r\npleasure and health._\r\n\r\n_In the principal or professional portion of the work, I have endeavoured\r\nto collect all the information in my power, and, in the exercise of my\r\njudgment, to sift the grain from the chaff, thus to steer clear of the\r\nextremes of exaggeration and scepticism. There has been too much of the\r\n~former~ abroad, and too much of the ~latter~ at home. Holding myself\r\nperfectly free from all obligation to subserve local interests on one\r\nside of the channel, or foster national prejudices on the other, I have\r\nspoken my mind, with equal fearlessness and, I hope, impartiality._\r\n\r\n_The typography of this volume will prove that, although I must plead\r\nguilty to the charge of “making a book,” it has not been constructed on\r\nthe approved principles of “BOOK MAKING.” By certain mechanical processes\r\nwell known “in the trade,” this slender tome might have been easily\r\nexpanded into two or even three goodly, or at least costly octavos,\r\nwithout the expenditure of a single additional line, word, or thought.\r\nBut, bearing in mind the old Greek maxim that “a great book is a great\r\nevil,” I was determined that, should my lucubrations come under this\r\nhead at all, the evil as well as the book should be on a small scale.\r\nSpa-going invalids have evils enough, God knows, to carry on their\r\nshoulders, without the addition, of a “MEGA BIBLION” in their wallets._\r\n\r\n_There is one defect in this work, however, which common honesty compels\r\nme to point out to the intending purchaser, before he parts with his\r\nmoney. If the travelling invalid expects to find here a catalogue of the\r\npost-houses, the signs of the inns, the prices of the wines, the fares of\r\nthe table-d’hôtes, the pretensions of the cuisine, &c. &c. &c., except\r\nupon very rare occasions, he will be woefully disappointed. All this\r\nspecies of information, and a great deal more, will be found in that\r\nexcellent emporium of peripatetic lore—“MURRAY’S HANDBOOK.” But even\r\nthis useful feature in the “red-book,” is not without its alloy. The\r\ncharacter of caravanserais is perpetually changing, as well as that of\r\ntheir landlords; and when one of these gets a good name in a guide book,\r\nthe afflux of travellers to that point too often causes the master to\r\nbecome proud, the servants lazy, the fare bad, and the bill exorbitant.\r\nMany a bitter anathema have I heard launched against the “Handbooks, &c.”\r\nfor leading tourists and invalids to be starved and fleeced at the “RED\r\nLION,” when they might have fared sumptuously and cheaply at the “BLACK\r\nSWAN.”_\r\n\r\n_Still, the Handbook is equally invaluable and indispensable to the\r\ncontinental traveller; and, as far as the Spas are concerned, Dr.\r\nGranville’s work is full of information on this subject. The profession\r\nand the public, indeed, are deeply indebted to Dr. Granville and Mr.\r\nEdwin Lee for opening out wider and clearer views of the continental\r\nmineral waters; but the subject itself, so far from being exhausted, is\r\nonly in its infancy of investigation. Whether we regard the constituent\r\nelements of the waters themselves, their physiological operation, or\r\ntheir remedial efficacy, there is ample room for many future inquirers._\r\n\r\n_I have now only to return my sincere thanks to the various German and\r\nother physicians on the continent, from whom I received oral, written, or\r\npublished information, and to say that I shall feel myself honoured by\r\nany future communications from the same sources, on the subject of the\r\nSpas._\r\n\r\n                                                         _JAMES JOHNSON._\r\n\r\n_Suffolk Place,

These breweries are deeply\r\nseated in the bowels of the Earth, and the art and mystery of their\r\nbrewings are far beyond the sight and cognizance of man. Whether cocculus\r\nIndicus, logwood, sloe-juice, or opium enter into their gigantic vats and\r\nboiling cauldrons, it is hard to say; but, however manufactured, they are\r\nthrown up on the surface of our globe, _pro bono publico_—greatly to the\r\ndetriment of doctors, druggists, and apothecaries, in this and in many\r\nother countries.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean distilleries are conducted on the homœopathic\r\nprinciple—viz. that of employing the minutest quantities of active\r\nmaterials—probably in order to do the least possible harm. They have many\r\nand great advantages over the homœopathic laboratories. They diffuse\r\ntheir ingredients through such immense potions of water, that, to get\r\nat a few grains of the _former_, we are obliged to ingurgitate some\r\nquarts of the _latter_. Now the mere mechanical flow of such prodigious\r\ndoses of fluid through the various outlets—the bowels, kidneys, skin,\r\n&c. must sweep away morbid secretions, and contribute to the breaking\r\ndown of obstructions in different organs, independently of the medicinal\r\nagents that are diffused through the mass of liquids in the greatest\r\npossible state of division and solution—circumstances which enable\r\nthem to permeate and penetrate through innumerable capillary tubes and\r\ncomplicated glandular apparatuses, where grosser materials could never\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nThe natural fountains of Hygeia, however, have other advantages and\r\nauxiliaries, of which the laboratory of the chemist, and the pharmacy\r\nof the practitioner are deprived. HOPE itself, though often resting\r\non fallacious and exaggerated histories of cures, contributes much to\r\nthe accomplishment of even marvellous recoveries. The severing, or even\r\nrelaxing of that chain which binds care round the human heart, and\r\naugments the sufferings and the progress of disease, is no mean ally of\r\nthe spa. It is true indeed, that the “splendid misery” of the great,\r\nand the corroding grief of the exile, cannot be thrown off by change of\r\nclimate—\r\n\r\n    Scandit æratas vitiosa naves\r\n    Cura—quid terras, alio calentes\r\n    Sole, mutamus—patriæ quis exul\r\n            Se quoque fugit?[1]\r\n\r\nBut the valetudinarian in pursuit of health, is somewhat differently\r\ncircumstanced. The change of scene and air—of food and drink—of rising\r\nand retiring—of exercise and conversation—in short, of the whole moral\r\nand physical conditions around him, effect, in many cases, such a\r\nmental and corporeal improvement, as makes easy work for the mineral\r\nwaters—especially when the extreme dilution of their contents is taken\r\ninto consideration.\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, however, that this picture is without any\r\nreverse. Many diseases—especially organic ones—are aggravated by the\r\njourney to a distant spa—by the imprudent use of the water—by the warm or\r\nhot bathing—by the enthusiasm or rather HYDROMANIA, of the spa-doctor,\r\nwho, having little acquaintance with the constitution of the patient,\r\nextols his favourite spring, and recommends it in almost every complaint.\r\nTo separate probabilities from improbabilities, and impossibilities from\r\nboth, will be attempted occasionally in the following pages, as we pass\r\nin review some of the principal resorts of invalids on both sides of the\r\nRhine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STEAMER.\r\n\r\nThe BATAVIER, all humps and hollows—the reverse of what one would expect\r\nin anything _Batavian_—and as ugly a black whale as ever floundered\r\nthrough an Arctic Ocean, received an ample cargo on the 3rd. of August\r\n183—. I shall not attempt to minutely analyse such a numerous as well\r\nas motley group, on the short acquaintance of twenty-six hours. It\r\nwas pretty evident, however, that we had on board representatives of\r\nvarious classes of society—more especially of the arts, sciences, and\r\nprofessions. The lawyer had left his clients to live in peace—the doctor\r\nhad left his patients to die in peace:—and the pastor had committed his\r\nflock to some vicarious shepherd. The merchant had handed his ledger, and\r\nthe banker his money-shovel to their clerks—and it seemed as though half\r\nthe shopocracy had left their counters in care of the shopmen.\r\n\r\nAll was bustle and confusion among the steamers starting for various\r\ndestinations—and I verily believe that the inhabitants of Pompeii\r\ndid not rush in greater haste or in greater numbers to the sea, when\r\nchased by the ashes and lava of Vesuvius, than did the inhabitants of\r\nthe metropolis to the banks of the Thames on this beautiful morning!\r\nThere were to be seen SENATORS, who had patriotically injured their own\r\nconstitutions while reforming that of their country—TAILORS from Bond\r\nStreet, going to Vienna and Athens to measure the “Corinthian pillars\r\nof the state,” on the philosophical principles of Laputa—aldermen from\r\nBucklersbury, to exude a portion of green fat and callipash in the\r\nvalleys of Switzerland—geological chemists, with hammers, bags, and\r\nblow-pipes, bound for the mountains of TAUNUS to ascertain the age of\r\nMOTHER EARTH, by means of the fish-bones, oyster-shells, and pebbles,\r\nwhich she had swallowed at some of her grand suppers—antiquarians\r\njourneying to the Roman forum to disinter the bones of M. Curtius and\r\nhis horse, which had lain so long in their marble cerements—engineers\r\nfrom a new joint-stock company to survey a line of rail-road over\r\nthe Great St. Bernard—candidates for the Traveller’s Club, going to\r\n_qualify_ by crossing some pons asinorum over the Danube—tourists of\r\nall calibres; some to make a tour simply; some to write a tour badly;\r\nbut the greater number to talk of a tour afterwards—NABOBS from the\r\nEast; some with the complexion of a star pagoda; some as pallid as a\r\nsicca rupee; and others as blue as Asiatic cholera—CANTABS, with their\r\ntutors, going to study spherics among the Alps of Oberland—OXONIANS, to\r\ncollate Greek and gibberish among the Ionian Isles—MISSIONARIES from\r\nPaternoster-row and Albemarle-street, to convert foolscap into food for\r\ncirculating libraries, and the “bitter wassers” of Germany into Burgundy\r\nand Champaigne for themselves—CONSERVATIVES flying from the “West-end,”\r\nto preserve the remnants of a shattered constitution—LANDLORDS from\r\nGreen Erin going to spend their rack-rents in the fashionable saloons of\r\nBaden Baden—ROUÉ’S from St. James’s, repairing, as a forlorn hope, to\r\nthe Cur-saals (anglice, CURSED HELLS) of Nassau and Bavaria—BACCHANALS,\r\nDEBAUCHEES, and GOURMANDS, hastening to Kissengen and Carlsbad, in hopes\r\nof restoring their jaded appetites and reducing their tumid livers—JUDGES\r\nfrom Westminster, who, in all actions of “RUS _versus_ URBEM,” had\r\nlately determined in favour of the plaintiff, without reference to the\r\njury—BISHOPS, who had left their black aprons on the Banks of the Thames,\r\nto have a peep at the lady with scarlet petticoats on the banks of the\r\nTyber—aspiring youths of enlarged views and high pretensions, determined\r\nto see the world from the summit of Mont Blanc—PALLID BEAUTIES, from\r\nPortman Square, with their anxious mammas, bound to Ems and Schwalbach,\r\nin hopes of transmuting their lillies into roses, by exchanging the\r\nmidnight waltz for the “mittag” meal, and fiery port for the sparkling\r\n“wein-brunnen”—faded belles and shattered beaux, of certain and uncertain\r\nages, repairing to Schlangenbad, for satin surfaces and renewal of youth.\r\nWe had members of both houses who had inhaled sulphuretted hydrogen gas\r\nto such an extent, in St. Stephens, during the session, as to cause\r\nviolent explosions of malodorous philippics, to the great annoyance of\r\ntheir opposite neighbours:—these were on their way to the Alps for pure\r\nair before the next eruption. Here were seen veterans from the “United\r\nService,” whose memories had survived their hopes, bound on a pilgrimage\r\nto Waterloo and Camperdown, to heave a last sigh over the setting sun of\r\nmartial glory, and the degenerate æra of insipid peace. Here were whigs,\r\ntories, radicals and revolutionists; together with men of high church,\r\nlow church, and no church doctrines, but all (incredible to relate)\r\nunanimously agreed on one principle, that of the “_mouvement_.”[2]\r\n\r\nThese and hundreds, not to say thousands of others, whose avocations,\r\nobjects, and pursuits were only known to themselves—\r\n\r\n                    ——an undistinguished crew\r\n    O’er whom her darkest wing Oblivion drew——\r\n\r\nwere rushing to the Thames, and deserting the Metropolis, as though it\r\nwere the “City of the Plague,” or the seat of Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Batavier. Honour to the man who first applied steam\r\nto locomotion. His ingenuity has enabled him to distil from water a light\r\nvapour which conquers the ocean from whence it sprang. It more than\r\nhalf diminishes the terror of the sea and the miseries of the voyage.\r\nIt brings Lisbon and Gibraltar within the same distance of London as\r\nEdinburgh used to be. Though lighter than the air we breathe, it can\r\nresist the impetuosity of the heaviest storm, and stem the torrent of the\r\nmost rapid river. It has nearly broken the trident of Neptune, and owns\r\nlittle allegiance to his sceptre. Steam may now say to the watery god,\r\nwhat the ocean monarch once said to a brother deity—\r\n\r\n    “Non tibi imperium Pelagi sævumque tridentem,\r\n    Sed mihi sorte datur.”——\r\n\r\nÆolus may unchain the winds—Boreas may bluster, and Auster may weep; but\r\nsteam heeds them not. Resistance only lends it strength, and oppression\r\nelasticity. The offspring of eternal and implacable enemies (fire and\r\nwater), its birth is invariably and necessarily fatal to its parents. The\r\nnew Being thus generated is as gigantic in power as it is transitory in\r\nexistence. Imprisoned for a moment, it bursts its barriers—regains its\r\nliberty—and dies! But these struggles for freedom work the iron wings\r\nthat impel the monster steamer through the briny waves. Deep in the\r\nwomb of this moving volcano, we see the fires of Ætna glowing—cauldrons\r\nboiling—pumps playing—chains clanking—Ixion’s wheels incessantly\r\nrevolving—steam roaring—and volumes of smoke belched upwards, to darken\r\nthe skies with artificial clouds. Could some of our forefathers rise from\r\ntheir graves, and behold a steamer flying over the waves against wind and\r\ntide, and without oar or sail, they would be not a little astonished,\r\nand curious enough to know the name of the planet to which they had been\r\nwafted after leaving their native earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA.\r\n\r\nCampbell, our immortal poet, has dedicated an amatory epistle to the\r\nsea, descriptive of her various charms. When in good humour, no lady\r\nhas a smoother face, or a more smiling countenance, and she then well\r\ndeserves the title of “mirror of the stars,” which the bard has gallantly\r\nconferred on her. But when ruffled in temper, she is one of the veriest\r\ntermagants I have ever encountered. She will then fret and foam—aye, and\r\nproceed from words to blows, knocking about her friends and her foes,\r\nlike stock-fish.\r\n\r\nMany have been the philtres and objurgations proposed for securing her\r\n“crispid smiles,” and obviating her “luxurious heavings;” but few of them\r\nare of any value. I have found it best to lie down, bandage my eyes,\r\nand let the angry Goddess have her own way. In the present instance\r\nher marine majesty was in a singularly mild mood, during the passage.\r\nA nautilus might have spread his sail and gone to sleep in safety.\r\nWe approached the low sand hills concealing a still lower surface of\r\ncountry—struck on the Brill—and after two or three rolls, the Batavier\r\ntumbled like a whale into the Maas. We were soon abreast of Schiedam,\r\nwhence volumes of smoke and vapour redolent of gin were wafted over us\r\nby the northern breeze, while a hundred windmills were whirling round\r\nas far as the eye could reach. It is curious that in Holland, the most\r\nwatery country in the world, grain is ground by means of wind; while in\r\nSwitzerland, the most windy country in Europe, corn is ground by means of\r\nwater. A moment’s reflection clears up the paradox. In Holland, water\r\nsleeps during seven days in the week, unmolested, save by the occasional\r\ncrawling of the trackschuyt:—in Switzerland, every stream leaps joyously\r\nfrom rock to rock, grinding the corn, washing the linen, spinning the\r\nflax, turning the lathes, and performing a hundred domestic services.\r\n\r\n\r\nROTTERDAM.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours after passing the Brill, we arrived at the most bustling\r\nand thriving town in Holland. A protracted line of shipping, receiving\r\nand discharging their cargoes—an even jetty or quay, planted with\r\nmajestic trees—and a long row of noble-looking houses facing the river,\r\npreclude all view of Rotterdam. It is impossible to get a prospect of\r\nany Dutch town except from its highest steeple. Immediately, as is my\r\ncustom, I ascended the spire of St. Lawrence’s cathedral, and there\r\nenjoyed a magnificent coup-d’œil of the fine sea-port, and the adjacent\r\ncountry, as far as the Hague. Each street is a kind of duplicate (double\r\nportrait) of the quay: the centre of almost every one being Macadamized,\r\nnot with granite or gravel, but with the masts, yards, decks, and high\r\nbugger-luggs of ships. This species of Macadamization not being the\r\nmost convenient for carriages or pedestrians, the broad trottoirs on\r\neach side, roughly paved and thickly planted, serve for all kinds of\r\nviators, and must give ample encouragement to corn-cutters, blacksmiths,\r\nveterinary surgeons, and coach-builders.\r\n\r\nNine-tenths of the houses present their gable-ends to the street—a\r\nhigh flight of steps leading to the hall—and a coach door at the side,\r\nleading to the court. Each mansion (where there is not an open shop)\r\nis a merchant’s castle, flanked with warehouses filled with goods,\r\nneatly furnished, and kept remarkably clean. The inhabitants differ from\r\nthose of an English town much less than the inhabitants of any other\r\ncontinental city. The women are far more fair and handsome than either\r\nthe French, Germans, or Italians—and the word “COMFORT,” unintelligible\r\nin any language but our own, is practically legible in every street of\r\nRotterdam.\r\n\r\nI made my bow to the statue of Erasmus, though the name called up some\r\nscholastic recollections, not of the most pleasant kind, as connected\r\nwith his Naufragium: after which, we perambulated this city of “ships,\r\ncolonies, and commerce,” till a late hour in the evening.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that John Bull first sets foot on any part of the\r\nContinent between Scandinavia and Cape Coast Castle, he begins to pay\r\ndaily the penalty of early-acquired and long-continued bad habits. But\r\nthis is not all. Some of his good habits stand in the way of his comfort\r\nand health. The sooner he makes up his mind to the change, the better.\r\nAnd first, of sleep. If he means to enjoy the blessings of “tired\r\nNature’s sweet restorer,” he must repair to his chamber as soon as\r\npossible after the sun has taken his evening bath in the Atlantic. And he\r\nshould spring from his couch before, rather than after, Apollo pleases\r\nto—\r\n\r\n    “Rise refulgent from Tithonus’ bed.”\r\n\r\nIn most of the continental towns, the streets are as silent as those of\r\nPompeii after ten o’clock; but the bustle begins at day-light, and he\r\nmust have taken a strong dose of opium who can sleep after that hour! The\r\ncocks are crowing, the carts are clattering, the waiters are knocking\r\nup the travellers going off by diligence or steamer, the travellers\r\nthemselves are bawling out for “eau chaude,” “warm wasser,” “boots,”\r\n“coffee,” or the “billet”—in short, the jargon of different languages\r\nresounding through the lobbies for an hour or two after day-light, would\r\nput Babel to shame. And last, not least, the eternal ding-dong of bells,\r\nespecially in Catholic countries, from dawn of day till eight o’clock,\r\nmight convince the most sceptical Protestant that PURGATORY is no fable,\r\nbut an actual punishment inflicted by the priests on this side of the\r\ngrave, as a foretaste of the future!\r\n\r\nStill, in most of the continental towns, there is an interval of five or\r\nsix hours in the night, during which the wearied limbs of the traveller\r\nmay rest, and his ears may be relieved from discordant sounds. Not so\r\nat Rotterdam. The night is infinitely more noisy than the day. It is\r\nthen that the real bustle begins at the HOTEL DES PAYS BAS, and along\r\nthe whole line of the quay. The absence of light appears to operate on\r\nthis amphibious race in the same way as it does on frogs, bats, and\r\nowls, and various animals addicted to nocturnal depredation. By midnight\r\nthe sailors of different nations begin to get sober for the second or\r\nthird time since morning, and the work of loading and unloading, craning\r\nand carting, &c. begins in good earnest. The eternal chorus of “_yo\r\nheave ho_,” from a thousand throats, o’ertopping, but not drowning the\r\nboisterous din of unutterable discord on all sides, would rouse the god\r\nof sleep from his bed of ebony, and put his prime minister, Morpheus, to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nHow the Rotterdamers preserve their lives in the midst of stagnant water\r\nsurrounding and pervading every habitation, and ingurgitated by man,\r\nwoman, and child, is only explicable on one of two principles—perhaps\r\nof both. They are accustomed to it, as the eels are to skinning:—or\r\nthe neighbouring SCHEIDAM poisons the animalculæ, and prevents their\r\npoisoning the people. There is yet one other supposition. In every\r\nhabitation and chamber of Rotterdam, and indeed of Holland, there is\r\nvery perceptible to the senses a malodorous effluvium, composed of three\r\ndifferent gases, and emanating from gin, peat and tobacco. This “tertium\r\n_quid_”—this “tria juncta in uno”—may possibly tend to counteract, or,\r\nat all events, to cover the malarious exhalations continually rising\r\nfrom a quiescent pool, into which the _debris_ of all utterable and\r\n_unutterable_ things are daily and nightly plunged![3]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAGUE.\r\n\r\nI have long been tired of rambling through museums and\r\npicture-galleries—churches and palaces—gardens and promenades; but I am\r\nabsolutely sick of the endless and reiterated descriptions of all these\r\nand a thousand other things, which every tourist delineates anew, as if\r\nhe had been the first visitor that ever saw the lions!\r\n\r\nIn these catalogues there can be nothing new, even to the fire-side\r\ntraveller, and I shall pass them by, with merely an occasional reflection\r\nor remark. I find but one or two notes in my diary of the Hague—one,\r\nthe record of a most capital BULL—not made by an Irishman, but by a\r\nDutchman—the “JEUNE TAUREAU,” by Paul Potter. This sturdy, stiff-necked,\r\nsandy-haired representative of my countrymen, is no bad sample of the\r\nbreed. I wish a certain animal of this species, which stands in Fleet\r\nStreet, with a mouth wide open, and greedy for all kinds of provender,\r\nwere to be brushed up a little, _a la Paul Potter_. I am sure it would\r\nincrease the number of spectators, if not of subscribers, to our witty,\r\nkeen, and sarcastic hebdomadal of Temple-bar.[4]\r\n\r\nAt the dull aristocratic and academic town of Leyden, we crossed a\r\nsad memorial of fallen greatness—the drivelling descendant of the\r\nmajestic Rhine, reduced to the dimensions of a canal, and, like the\r\ndegenerate offspring of some renowned hero, disgracing the line of his\r\nnoble ancestor! Restive and perverse in its last act, it only _flows_\r\nwhen the tide _ebbs_, and stands motionless during the flood. Leyden\r\nbeing a university “open to all parties,” and influenced by merit only\r\n(with a little gold), it imposes no oath on the candidates for its\r\ndegrees—whatever may be the creed of the aspirant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAERLEM.\r\n\r\nThis is a phrenological city, distinguished by a remarkable bump—the\r\nlargest “organ of music” in the world. But there is a greater lion in\r\nHaerlem than the great organ—one whose distant roarings have struck more\r\nterror into the heart of John Bull than did ever Napoleon, with his\r\nlegions at Boulogne. This monstrous birth of the French revolution—this\r\noffspring of atheism and education, in which the orthodox light is\r\nextinguished—\r\n\r\n    “Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum,”\r\n\r\nis neither more nor less than a “NORMAL SCHOOL.” As this term is not in\r\nJohnson’s Dictionary, it is inferred by our home oracles, that it exists\r\nnot in any language, ancient or modern. As I cannot give its derivation,\r\nI shall try at its definition. It is a school where “_boys and girls are\r\ntaught the rudiments of knowledge without wrangling about creeds_.” It\r\nis alike open to the Jew and the Gentile, the Protestant and Catholic,\r\nthe Baptist and Anabaptist, the Unitarian and Trinitarian. Now as each\r\nof these sects holds its own theology to be the true orthodox one, I\r\ndo not see how any _one form_ of religious instruction can be combined\r\nwith elementary education. We might as well try to force the same note\r\non all the inmates of a menagerie, as the same creed on all the elèves\r\nof a normal school. And, after all, why should theology be taken out of\r\nthe hands of the pastor, to be put into those of the pedagogue? May not\r\nletters be taught without a Liturgy—and cyphering without a Catechism? We\r\nsee that, in two of the most Protestant countries—Prussia and Holland—the\r\nsystem works well, at least peaceably. The children of various sects\r\ncan learn to read without ridiculing, and to write without stigmatizing\r\neach other’s creeds. They live in peace while acquiring the rudiments of\r\nhuman knowledge at school—and they repair to the chapels or synagogues\r\nof their parents to hear the word of God, where it is most properly\r\ndelivered. A youthful harmony or even friendship is thus generated among\r\nall persuasions, and is never afterwards entirely obliterated.\r\n\r\nBut I imagine that an unnecessary dread of this “tree of knowledge,”\r\nwhose mortal fruit—\r\n\r\n    “Brought death into the world and all our woe,”\r\n\r\nis entertained by the good people of England. Reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic do not constitute knowledge, but merely the machinery by which\r\nit may be afterwards acquired. These rudiments are, like the types of the\r\nprinter distributed in their compartments—void of learning or science in\r\nthemselves, till they are worked up by the compositor—who, himself is\r\nonly an instrument in the hands of a higher agent. “The instruction given\r\nin the schools (says an excellent observer, Mr. Chambers) is deficient\r\nof nearly all that bears on the cultivation of the perceptive and\r\nreflective faculties, and consequently the expansion of the intellect.”\r\nThis education rarely extends beyond reading, writing, arithmetic, and\r\ngeography—while the superior orders are taught the French language.\r\nAt or under 14 years of age, the child leaves school and merges on the\r\nordinary avocations of life. There is in Holland nearly a total absence\r\nof scientific instruction. Words not things are taught, and no taste is\r\ngenerated for literature. Yet this elementary education at school, and\r\nreligious instruction at home, have rendered the people remarkable for\r\norder, piety, and morality. In no other country is there so little crime\r\nor squalid poverty.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say as much for civil as for religious liberty in this\r\ncountry. The press is more completely muzzled than any cart-dog in\r\nLondon. The latter may open his jaws so far as to growl; but the press\r\nis hermetically sealed in this submarine territory. No book can be\r\ntranslated or published without the censor’s license—nay, a hand-bill,\r\nannouncing the importation of Warren’s blacking or Morrison’s pills,\r\ncannot be printed or affixed to a wall, without a license and a stamp! In\r\na conversation with an intelligent Dutchman respecting this restriction\r\non the press, I was completely silenced by the following argument. I\r\nbelieve, said the gentleman, that in your profession, _prevention_ is\r\nconsidered to be better than cure. I assented. Then, said he, I observe\r\nin all your newspapers that people are tried, and sometimes severely\r\npunished, for publishing libels, although the authors may not believe\r\nthem to be such at the time of writing them. Now the paternal Government\r\nof Holland _prevents_ such misfortunes and evils from happening to its\r\nsubjects, by examining the document before publication, and thus taking\r\non itself the responsibility, in case it should turn out afterwards to\r\nbe libellous. There was no answering this argument. The Dutch are the\r\nmost patient animals that ever lived beneath a yoke, or bowed beneath a\r\nload of taxes. Talk of John Bull’s rates and taxes! They are bagatelles\r\ncompared to those in Holland! Every species of business, from the cobbler\r\nto the ship-builder, is taxed after a graduated scale, varying from\r\na few shillings to twenty or thirty pounds annually. Every dwelling,\r\nevery window, door, fireplace—even the furniture, is taxed according to\r\nits value! The taxes on houses are more than a fourth of the rent! The\r\nnecessaries of life are, in fact, extremely dear, and were it not for\r\nthe solace of tobacco, gin, and coffee, the poorer classes of Dutchmen\r\nwould die in their dykes under the pressure of hunger and taxation,\r\nnotwithstanding their loyalty to KING, and love of VADERLAND!\r\n\r\n\r\nAMSTERDAM.\r\n\r\nHow often does the monotonized traveller in Holland and Belgium sigh\r\nfor the luxury of a zig-zag mule-track along the steep acclivity of\r\nsome alpine height, as a change of scene from the eternal right-lined\r\nchaussée, terminating out of sight, beyond the verge of the horizon,\r\nor dipping apparently, like Pharaoh’s route, into a lake or the\r\nocean! The Haerlem pavé is constantly menaced by the Zuyder-Zee on\r\nthe right, and the German Ocean on the left; but it escapes a watery\r\ngrave, and safely lands the weary tourist in Amsterdam. Ascending the\r\ntower of the Stadthouse, or palace, I cast my wondering eyes over the\r\nlargest community of beavers that ever lived upon logs, or drove their\r\nfar-fetched piles into the muddy bottom of lake or pool! Strange that\r\nthe dry land of this our globe should not afford space enough for cities\r\nor towns, without invading the Adriatic and the Zuyder-Zee for the sites\r\nof Venice and Amsterdam! From this bird’s-eye view, the confusion and\r\ncommixture of land and water is inextricable and incalculable. The city\r\nstands on nearly one hundred detached islets, connected by more than\r\nthree times that number of drawbridges—the houses rising bolt upright out\r\nof the water—each street being a quay lined with trees—and each mansion\r\na warehouse, as evinced by the crane and rope at the attic for hoisting\r\nin goods, furniture, fuel, and provisions. The space between the houses\r\nand the water, is much narrower than at Rotterdam, and I think the bustle\r\nand activity of commerce are far less conspicuous in the northern than\r\nin the southern entrepôt. The water, though capable of floating ships,\r\nis unfit for cooking or drinking—and, were it not for the springs of\r\nSeltzer, and the distilleries of Scheidam, I imagine that hydrophobia\r\nwould universally prevail.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the Amsterdammers were originally a colony from Palestine.\r\nLike the “chosen people,” they are much fonder of conveying merchandize\r\nfrom one hand to another, than of manufacturing any article of trade or\r\ncommerce. The only fabrications that I could see, were those of ships\r\nto carry, and houses to contain goods. The building of houses has long\r\nbeen limited to the re-construction of those whose foundations had given\r\nway—and naval architecture has received many checks—the annihilation\r\nof the whale-fishery among others. But the red-herring still cheers\r\nthe heart of the Hollander, and qualifies the brackish water of the\r\nZuyder-Zee. While wandering through the streets in the evening, I\r\nfound that gin-palaces were not confined to England. They are on a\r\nsplendid scale here, and frequented by better classes of society than\r\nin the British metropolis. We saw burgesses—probably burgomasters—with\r\ntheir wives, and sometimes with their children, drinking, smoking, and\r\nlistening to the dulcet sounds of Swiss or Bavarian hurdi-gurdies. This\r\nwas not quite in keeping with the grave, moral, and religious character\r\nof the Dutchman.\r\n\r\nIt is not my inclination—to say the truth, it is not my forte—to describe\r\nthe lions of Amsterdam—or of any of the other dams in this hybrid\r\noffspring of land and water. It was quite enough for me to see the\r\nshows—their pictorial delineation I leave to those of my tourist brethren\r\nwho have studied under that inimitable painter, and hero of the hammer,\r\nGeo. Robins, Esq. They can readily transmute a varnished treckschuyt\r\ninto a Cleopatra’s barge—a buggerlugg into a bust of bronze—a Flanders\r\nmare into a prancing Bucephalus—a brick trottoir into a tesselated\r\npavement—or a Belgian flat into a garden of the Hesperides. The worst\r\nof this is, that, by the time they have ascended the Rhine, or entered\r\nSwitzerland, their stock of the picturesque is expended, and they have\r\nonly the sublime to draw upon for the remainder of the tour.\r\n\r\nTo see the sights of Amsterdam, the gilders and stivers must be in\r\nperpetual motion. Even at the doors of the churches, the padré’s demand\r\nyour money for admittance into their cold, damp, and dreary tabernacles—a\r\nmost unusual practice on the Continent.\r\n\r\nIn order to vary the journey, we returned by Utrecht to Rotterdam:—but\r\nalthough the route was _alter_, the scene was _idem_—and I will not\r\ndetain the reader with any account of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATAVIAN CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\nOf all the geological ups and downs which the surface of this globe\r\npresents, none is more remarkable, or less remarked, than that which\r\nthe land of Holland has undergone. Every particle of its soil must once\r\nhave occupied some higher land or even mountain of the Continent, before\r\nit travelled down to take its bath in the ocean—ultimately to rise to\r\nnearly the level of the sea—then to be rescued from the waters, partly\r\nby the operations of Nature, and partly by the industry of man. Even\r\nnow the mighty Alps are daily crumbling down, and every shower of rain,\r\nand mountain torrent washes down its quota of soil to the Mediterranean\r\nor the German Ocean.[5] Should no volcanic revolution interrupt these\r\nwatery changes, a period must come—ten thousand years are but a dot in\r\nthe stream of time—when the high lands will be worn down into alluvial\r\ndeposits which, rising from their oceanic beds, will become annexations\r\nto the existing plains. The lower heights will of course shew the effects\r\nof this “wear and tear” sooner than the snow-clad Alps; but even these\r\nlast must one day undergo that transmutation and transplantation to which\r\nall sublunary things are destined. This is no imaginary speculation. It\r\nis not in Holland alone that we see vast tracts of land carried down from\r\nthe hills—buried in the deep, for a time—and afterwards rescued from\r\ntheir watery beds. The Delta of the Nile was once among the mountains\r\nof Abyssinia—the Sunderbunds have spread far and wide to the south of\r\nCalcutta, dividing the Ganges into a hundred mouths—extending the land\r\ninto the bay of Bengal, and sustaining myriads of animals, and even man\r\nhimself—the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence are digging the grave of the\r\nAlligagny mountains—the mighty Andes—“Giant of the Western Star,” who now\r\n\r\n    “Looks from his throne of clouds o’er half the world”—\r\n\r\nis silently and slowly suffering disintegration by the PLATA and AMAZON,\r\ncommitting its atoms to the depths of the Atlantic, thence to emerge,\r\nat some remote epoch, the habitation of races of animated beings that\r\nhave no types, perhaps, in the present or past creations. Even the\r\ncloud-capt Himalaya, whose base extends over thousands of miles, feeds\r\nwith its substance the insatiate mouths of the Indus, the Ganges, the\r\nBurrhampooter, and the Yrawaddy, whose turbid waves roll down to distant\r\nseas the alluvial tribute; themselves the unconscious ministers of an\r\nAlmighty will!\r\n\r\nThus it would appear that the _levelling_ principle is as operative in\r\nthe _physical_ as in the _moral_ world—among mountains as well as among\r\nmen. But there is one great and essential difference between the two.\r\nThe Himalaya may require thousands of years longer to wear down than the\r\nCordillera. This is merely a difference in time. But no time, or space,\r\nor circumstance can effect an equilibrium in the moral or intellectual\r\nworld. If such a level could be obtained, it would instantly perish,\r\nor recede to a greater distance than ever. Equality of this kind, like\r\nHeaven’s bright bow—\r\n\r\n    “Allures from far yet as we follow flies.”\r\n\r\nEqual right can never lead to equal might.\r\n\r\nBut to return from this digression. How is it that the Helvetian and the\r\nHollander, whose countries are the very antipodes of each other—whose\r\nmanners, customs, and pursuits are as different as Alps are from\r\nsand-hills, should yet present a more striking similarity in one moral\r\nfeature, than the inhabitants of any other two countries? Of all the\r\nnations of Europe, the Helvetians and Hollanders, inhabiting the highest\r\nand the lowest grounds in the world, are most enthusiastically attached\r\nto their native soils, and experience the greatest degree of nostalgic\r\nyearning when separated from home. The _amor patriæ_ of the Swiss is\r\nproverbial—that of the Dutchman is quite as strong, though not so well\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n“The Hollander (says Mr. Chambers,) is bred up from his infancy to have\r\nthe highest ideas of his “_Vaderland_”—of her people—her warriors—her\r\nwealth—her power. He is taught to consider this _Vaderland_ as standing\r\nhighest in the rank of nations—that every thing belonging to her is\r\n_best_. He is an admirer, without being a benefactor of his country—a\r\npatriot without public spirit—contented and self-satisfied with his\r\ncountry and every thing belonging thereto.”\r\n\r\nThe Helvetian can hardly be more enamoured of his mountains than is the\r\nHollander of his alluvial plains! But whence this coincidence? Is it that\r\nthe Dutchman remembers the _high descent_ of his native soil—that it\r\nfloated down from the Alps and other highlands—that it was redeemed from\r\nthe ocean by his labour and skill—enriched, fertilized, and adorned by\r\nthe industry of his forefathers—and, finally, that it had become, under\r\nhis fostering care, a second “Garden of Eden,” the pride of Batavians,\r\nand the envy of the world?\r\n\r\nOr is it that extremes approximate?—That the hardy Helvetian, raised\r\nabove the storm’s career, but whose—\r\n\r\n    “Rocks by custom turn to beds of down,”\r\n\r\ncan look, with feelings of pride and independence, from his airy citadel\r\nof health and activity, down on surrounding nations—whilst the phlegmatic\r\nHollander, secure from winds and waves, under the shelter of his\r\nbreak-water ramparts, surveys with kindred feelings and self-gratulations\r\nhis fertile flats, his irrigated fields, and commerce-bearing canals—his\r\nsenses steeped in that musing mood, that “fool’s paradise” suspended\r\nmidway between the excitement of gin, and the tranquillity of tobacco?\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there can be little doubt that the moral and physical\r\ncharacter—the inward temperament and outward man—are all very much\r\nmodified by the climate, the soil, and the circumstances around us. It\r\nmight not be difficult to shew that the prominent characteristics of the\r\npeople in question are modified by these external agencies. The Hollander\r\nis accustomed to watch, with the patience of a cat, for that precise\r\nperiod when the alluvial deposits on his shores have attained that level\r\nwhich permits him to stretch out his mounds of earth, and grasp the piece\r\nof newly-emerged ground for future culture:—hence his _patience_ and\r\n_vigilance_ through life, while watching the opportunity of benefiting\r\nhimself. He observes, from infancy, the labour and expense of realizing\r\nthis property in the soil:—hence his ECONOMY, even to parsimony. His\r\nclimate is damp and cold: his temperament is therefore PHLEGMATIC.\r\nThe surface of his country is flat and monotonous; without monuments\r\nof antiquity, historical renown, or classical recollections:—there\r\nis, consequently, no more POETRY in his composition than in a Dutch\r\ncheese, or a stagnant canal. Living beneath the level of the ocean,\r\nhe is liable to inundations from the watery element:—he is therefore\r\nhabitually CAUTIOUS of all contingencies. The equinoxes, the vernal\r\nand autumnal floods, the changes of the moon, are all important epochs\r\nand events in a submarine territory;—he is, therefore, a CALCULATING\r\nanimal, from his cradle to his grave. At war with the elements, he is\r\nnaturally BRAVE even to obstinacy, whether the cause be right or wrong;\r\nand will fight to the knees in blood, rather than either advance or\r\nretreat. Monotony being almost universal, ideality is nearly null:—the\r\nDutchman, therefore, smokes during the greater part of his time, in\r\ndefault of conversation—tobacco being, at once, the cause and the\r\nexcuse for TACITURNITY. In Holland there are nearly as many canals\r\nfor communication, as there are dykes for defence:—the Batavian is,\r\ntherefore, eminently COMMERCIAL:—but the limits of the soil being narrow,\r\nand the population dense, colonization became necessary, despite of the\r\n“VADERLANDSLEIFDE,” and emigration continues though the colonies have\r\ndwindled away. The intellectual views of the Hollander are nearly as\r\nlimited as his geographical. There are no mountains, whence a wide and\r\nvaried prospect can be taken in by the eye—neither are there academic\r\neminences, from which the mind can soar into the regions of literature,\r\nscience, art, or philosophy. As it is infinitely more difficult to raise\r\ndykes than children—to extend the soil, than to swell the census—so the\r\nBatavian has been a political economist long before the science was\r\ntaught by Malthus, or practised by Martineau, in this country. As a\r\nmerchant, he is honest and honourable in his negociations abroad—punctual\r\nas his pipe in receipts and disbursements at home. Exclusively\r\noccupied with the concerns of self—whether ruminating, fumigating, or\r\ncalculating—he has little time, and less inclination, to meddle with\r\naffairs of state. The measure of his patriotism is amply sufficient for\r\nan abundance of loyalty—and if “passive obedience and non-resistance”\r\nbe cardinal virtues in subjects, then the Dutch ought to be dear to the\r\nheart of their sovereign. I have no doubt that they are so. It is only a\r\nmatter of reciprocal feeling—for assuredly the sovereign is _dear_ to the\r\nDutch.\r\n\r\nEmbarking at Rotterdam, the steamer ploughs its weary way through the\r\nmuddy Maas for three long days, before it reaches Cologne. One night is\r\nspent in the malodorous town of Nymeguen—and the other on board—so that,\r\naltogether, this is one of the most monotonous voyages that could well\r\nbe projected. There is not even the satisfaction of finding one bank or\r\nplace more ugly, or more uninteresting than another—which would be some\r\nlittle variety, and afford some subject for remark. All is puddle-dock\r\nin the near, and sand-bank in the distance. Here and there the spire of\r\na church, the roof of a house, or the mast of a schuyt appears on the\r\nhorizon, for a time, and vanishes again in the blank.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOGNE.\r\n\r\nIf the narrow streets of Cologne be famous, or rather infamous, for bad\r\nsmells, it is to be recollected that the _waters_ of that ancient city\r\nare more valuable than the _wines_ of the neighbouring Rhine:—that they\r\nare carried to every corner of the earth—and prized for their delicious\r\nflavour, beyond the richest productions of Rudesheim or Johannisberg.\r\nThus good cometh out of evil—and the most grateful perfume is exhaled\r\nfrom the most malodorous city of Europe. “Give a dog a bad name,” and the\r\nsooner you shoot him the better. Yet if a stranger arrived at Cologne,\r\nby day or by night, not knowing the name of the place, he might traverse\r\nits numberless and crooked streets, without remarking more disagreeable\r\nscents than his nose would encounter on the banks of the Tiber, the\r\nArno, or the Seine—in the wynds of Auld Reekie, the Gorbals of Glasgow,\r\nthe purlieus of the Liffey—or even of father Thames, between Puddle-dock\r\nand Deptford. I will not maintain that all the little rivulets which\r\nmeander the streets of this town, after a shower of rain, are the\r\nveritable “_Eau de Cologne_” of Messieurs Farina; but I must say that\r\nthe olfactories of my fair countrywoman of the “Souvenirs,” were more\r\ndelicate than impartial, when she penned the following sentence. “But the\r\ndreadful effluvia of the black, filthy streams that defile every street,\r\npenetrated even through the folds of pocket-handkerchiefs soaked in\r\nperfume.”—_Souvenir_, p. 93.\r\n\r\nFiction being the “soul of poetry,” we need not wonder that the BARD\r\nshould seize the opportunity of having his fling at poor Cologne.\r\nAccordingly COLERIDGE exercised his wit and his acrimony in the following\r\nlines, in which he apostrophises CLOACINA, and the nymphs, “who reign\r\no’er sewers and sinks.”\r\n\r\n    “The river Rhine, it is well known,\r\n    Doth wash the city of Cologne,\r\n    But tell me nymphs, what power divine\r\n    Shall henceforth wash the river Rhine?”\r\n\r\nProbably it was this real or supposed pollution which caused the noble\r\nriver to dive into the sands, soon after passing Cologne, and hide its\r\nhead for ever. It cannot be denied that Cologne is a city of the dirty\r\nand malodorous order—and we cannot much wonder at the fact, seeing that\r\nit was Roman in the beginning, and has never changed its nature or name\r\nfrom the days of Germanicus to the present moment. After passing from\r\nthe Romans to the Franks, and from the Franks to the Germans, it became\r\na “HOLY CITY”—and that was enough to ruin Rome itself. It became, of\r\ncourse, the rendezvous of priests, monks, and nuns, and the seat of\r\nabbeys, monasteries, nunneries, and churches. Notwithstanding these\r\nmisfortunes, it rose into a rich and flourishing entrepôt of commerce,\r\nwhen its bigotted ecclesiastical government took the wise resolution of\r\nbanishing the merchants, because most of them were Jews and Protestants.\r\nThe exiles settled in other cities on the Rhine, and left the swarms of\r\nmonks and priests among their rotten relics, to starve and “stink in\r\nstate.” Here we have a key to the malodorous effluvia that penetrated\r\nthe perfumed handkerchief of the lady of the “Souvenirs”—for I will be\r\nbold enough to aver that she did not leave a nook or corner unexplored\r\nin Cologne, where anything _curious_ was to be seen. It is a great pity\r\nthat Napoleon, when he suppressed the convents and monasteries, did not\r\norder the scavengers and police to sweep out all the mouldering bones,\r\nputrefying flesh, and decomposing integuments of saints and martyrs\r\nthat have been congregated in churches, chapels, and other monastic\r\ninstitutions for two thousand years. If this had been done at Cologne,\r\nthere would have been no occasion for perfumed handkerchiefs to the noses\r\nof travellers.\r\n\r\nBy the way, where were the brains of the three magi, or _wise_ men of the\r\neast, (whose skulls are crowned and impearled here,) when they allowed\r\nthe suicidal decree to go forth against the merchants of Cologne? These\r\nrelics of the church perform miraculous cures of physical ills; but they\r\nnever, by any accident, prevent, much less punish, the perpetration of\r\nmoral mischief. The schoolmaster is much more wanted than the scavenger\r\nin Cologne!\r\n\r\n                    —— “Alchymists may doubt\r\n    The shining gold their crucibles give out;\r\n    But faith—fanatic faith—once wedded fast\r\n    To some dear falsehood—hugs it to the last.”\r\n\r\nThe first rush is made to the hotel—and the next to the Dom Kirche—an\r\nunfinished cathedral, of course—like all great abbeys—for, if finished,\r\nno more contributions could be levied. A tower of the cathedral,\r\n_intended_—abbeys, like some other places, are “paved with good\r\nintentions”—to be 500 feet high, but which only attained the altitude\r\nof 20 feet, throws all sentimental tourists into ecstasies. From its\r\nbrother, which grew up much taller, a good panoramic view of Cologne\r\nand vicinity is obtained. Then comes the tomb of skulls—the crania of\r\nthe three magi—Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar—stolen by the mother of\r\nConstantine from the Holy Land—conveyed by some mysterious agency from\r\nConstantinople to Milan—and thence pillaged by Barbarossa, and presented\r\nto the Bishop of Cologne! For 700 years these empty skulls have been\r\ngazed at by the millions of numbskulls still emptier, that have come to\r\nvisit them! They are decorated with gilt crowns, set with pearls—and\r\ntheir names are written in ruby characters!\r\n\r\nNear these holy, but harmless relics, are deposited, among many masses of\r\nbones and filth—“_les entrailles_” of Queen Marie de Medicis, together\r\nwith the head of St. Peter, &c. &c. &c. But in the church of St. Ursula,\r\nthings are done on a grander scale. The bones of 11,000 English ladies,\r\nwho were wrecked in the Rhine, _on their voyage to Rouen_!! are here\r\ndeposited—the owners having taken the veil rather than join in wedlock\r\nwith the HUNS, who then possessed the Holy City. Other records say that,\r\nin imitation of Lucretia, they sacrificed their lives to preserve their\r\nhonour—and their bones were carefully preserved from that time to this!\r\nDid the fair lady of the “Souvenirs” hold her “perfumed handkerchief”\r\nto her nose, while contemplating these blanched remains of her heroic\r\nsisterhood?\r\n\r\nThe city of Cologne measures seven miles in circumference—her streets\r\nare narrow—and her houses are high. Yet the population scarcely exceeds\r\n50,000 souls—with bodies attached to them!! Thus then, it is evident\r\nthat this Holy City is one vast cemetery, partly above, and partly\r\nunder ground—a huge museum of mouldering anatomy, useless alike to the\r\nliving and the dead, and only commemorative of the weakness, darkness,\r\nignorance, and superstition of the human mind!\r\n\r\nI confess that I was silly enough, nearly twenty years ago, to spend some\r\ndays and dollars in exploring these mummeries at Cologne; and those who\r\nprefer such pursuits to the pure air of the mountains, and the smiling\r\nlandscapes of Nature on the banks of the Rhine, may follow the example.\r\n\r\nAt nine o’clock in the morning, we left the Hotel du Rhin, and repaired\r\nto the busy banks of the river, where steam was hissing, and tourists\r\nwere bustling into the vessels. Five or six arches of the bridge suddenly\r\nslipped their cables, and swinging round by the impulse of the stream,\r\nopened a free passage for the ascending and descending boats. Away they\r\nwent upwards and downwards, full of passengers—some on the tiptoe of\r\nexpectation to see the wonders of the Rhine—others, having satisfied\r\ntheir curiosity, were winging their way home, to the chalky cliffs of Old\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RHINE.\r\n\r\nAnd here we change the land of facts for the land of fictions. We now\r\nenter the regions of romance and robbery—of love and murder—of tilts\r\nand tournaments—of dungeons deep and turrets lofty—of crusades against\r\nthe creed of the Ottoman abroad, and of forays against the property\r\nor life of the neighbour at home—of riot and revelry in the castle,\r\nand of penury and superstition in the cottage—of beetling precipice\r\nand winding river—of basaltic rock and clustering vine—of wassail\r\nwar and vintage carol. It is probable that few ascend this famous\r\nriver without experiencing some feelings of disappointment, although\r\nnone will acknowledge it, lest their taste should be condemned, and\r\nthemselves voted to be barbarians, insensible alike to the beauties of\r\nnature and the wonders of art. But the Rhine, like many a fine child,\r\nhas been spoiled—especially by poets and painters. The tourists and\r\nromance-writers, too, have combined to spoil the Rhine-child—for although\r\nall romance-writers are not tourists, yet all tourists are, _ex officio_,\r\nromance-writers.\r\n\r\nThus the mountains of the Rhine, though none of them are much higher than\r\nthe rock of Gibraltar—are represented as “stupendous”—every dingle and\r\ndell that opens between the hills, is painted as more beautiful than the\r\nvalley of Rasselas, Chamounix, or Grindenwalde—the river itself is made\r\nto flow like liquid emeralds or sapphires, though it receives so many\r\nmuddy streams, after its partial filter in Constance, that it is nearly\r\nas yellow as the Tiber, and as turbid as the Thames, before it gets\r\nhalf-way between Schaffhausen and Dusseldorf.[6] The vines too, which\r\nare strung on stunted sticks, like onions,—enclosed between rude stone\r\nterraces—and which more frequently disfigure than embellish the banks\r\nof the Rhine, are extolled beyond those of Italy, which are gracefully\r\nfestooned from tree to tree, bending down the branches with the weight of\r\ndelicious grapes. Notwithstanding these and many other deficiencies on\r\nthe one hand, and exaggerations on the other (which all will acknowledge\r\nin their hearts, though none will declare by their tongues), the Rhine\r\nis the most picturesque, beautiful, romantic, and interesting river on\r\nthe face of our globe. I have twice ascended, and thrice descended the\r\nstream, from its source in the Alps to its sepulture in the ocean—with\r\nvarious lateral excursions—and still with undiminished pleasure. But then\r\nI came to the survey with a conviction that, like all other places of the\r\nkind, it was flattered by the painter, falsified by the poet, and dressed\r\nin meretricious ornaments by the tourist and novellist. I was therefore\r\nnot disappointed, but highly gratified.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACHENFELS.\r\n\r\nKnowing, from experience, that the first twenty miles of the Rhine from\r\nCologne, are totally devoid of interest, I left my companions at their\r\nwine in the RHENISCHER, and started in the diligence for Bonn—and thence\r\nto Godesberg, where I slept. Long before sunrise I had crossed the Rhine,\r\nand threaded my way up the steeps of the Drachenfels. This is probably\r\nthe finest view on the Rhine—far superior to that which Sir F. Head has\r\ndescribed as taken from the top of a tree on the hill behind the Bad-haus\r\nat Schlangenbad.\r\n\r\n“The Drachenfels, which is the steepest of the Seven Mountains, has\r\ninfinitely the advantage of situation, rising abruptly from the river\r\nto a stupendous height, clothed midway with rich vines and foliage, and\r\nterminating in red and grey rock. On its brow are the ruins of an ancient\r\ncastle, standing on their colossal and perpendicular base—a type of man’s\r\nperseverance and power. The magnificent and picturesque prospects which\r\nencompass on all sides this enchanting spot, as if Nature, with a profuse\r\nand lavish hand, had diffused around so many and varied beauties, that\r\nhaving exhausted her wonted combination of mountain, hill, and dale, with\r\nwater, flowery mead, cultivated field, mantling forests, and luxuriant\r\nvineyards, she had by this profusion of witching scenery peculiarly\r\nmarked it for her own.” This description is not exaggerated—which\r\nis saying a great deal for it. The Drachenfels, indeed, has been\r\nimmortalized by legendary tale, poetic lore, and pictorial delineation.\r\nAn ingenious artist of the present day, (Mr. Leigh,) has recently given\r\na panoramic view from the summit of this rock, with all the fidelity and\r\nminuteness of the painter. I can corroborate the description, though\r\nI could not imitate the picture. A short extract or two will serve as\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\n“The whole of this delicious panorama was bathed in a flood of subdued\r\ngolden light, which intermingled its luscious hues with the cooler tones\r\nof twilight. As if preparing to receive the setting sun with glory, the\r\nhorizon emitted a deep yet brilliant crimson lustre, spangled with flakes\r\nof gold, while richer and more fantastic streaks of purple appeared ready\r\nto envelop its glowing form as it slowly and majestically sailed behind\r\nthe darkened curtain of the distant hills. The nearer features of this\r\nlovely scene, illumined by the silvery aspect of lingering day, were\r\ninvested with a tranquil dignity and beauty which soothed the vision as\r\nit embraced their harmonious contours, softened by the genial light.\r\nThe more distant objects partook of the hue of the glowing west, and,\r\nby their deep tone, enhanced the paler radiance of the more immediate\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\n“The character of the entire scene is extremely imposing: the site\r\nwhence it is beheld is sufficiently lofty to command an immense extent,\r\nyet not so elevated as to make all around dwindle into collections of\r\nspots. Its beauty is not of that uniform description which presents an\r\nendless succession of cultivated points, without offering any features of\r\nstriking interest; for, while on the one side, the eye glides along vast\r\nand varied plains, on the other, it ranges over all the diversities of a\r\nmountainous country, from the bare and rugged castled crags to the green\r\nuplands shelving down to picturesque valleys and streams.\r\n\r\n“To the north the series of gentle eminences and valleys lose their\r\nindividual distinctions, and blend into one extensive plain, patched\r\nwith the varied colours of their produce, and dotted with the divisions\r\nof trees and hedges which unite by their graceful lines the numerous\r\nvillages that intersect it. On this variegated expanse the serpentine\r\ncourse of the unruffled Rhine may be traced like a stream of molten\r\nsilver, flowing onwards towards Cologne, its bright bosom continuously\r\nseen, occasionally bearing specks of vessels gently descending with the\r\ncurrent. Innumerable towers and spires gleam amidst the verdant glades,\r\nor peer from the deepening woods; and as the eventide breeze flows\r\nthrough the gentle air, the pleasing and varied harmonies of chiming\r\nbells, afar and near, break upon the ear.”\r\n\r\n“On the same side, a series of gradual elevations, shelving down to the\r\nRhine, forms the commencement of the cluster of the Drachenfels, whose\r\nbold forms sweep majestically around the towering rock of the Dragon,\r\nlike the turbulent waves of the ocean against the soaring lighthouse.\r\nTurning to the west, the conical form of the Godesberg, surmounted by\r\nits picturesque towers, and relieved by the sparkling habitations at its\r\nbase, stands out conspicuously from the deeper toned ridge of hills,\r\nby which it appears shut in between Bonn and Rolandseck. Behind this\r\nwooded screen are the diversified forms of the Eifel chain, extending in\r\nvarious ramifications towards Spa, Treves, and Luxembourg, occupying the\r\nterritory between the Mosel and the Maas.”\r\n\r\n“On the shore beyond, embowered amidst the surrounding uplands, is the\r\npartially concealed town of Oberwinter; beyond which, a sharp point\r\nof land juts into the Rhine, nearly opposite the village of Unkel.\r\nFrom this point commences the interminable series of mountain summits,\r\nwhich stretch along the horizon in all the grandeur of form, harmony of\r\ncomposition, and fascination of colour. The eye rises from the placid\r\nbosom of the Rhine, in which the pure sky is serenely mirrored, and,\r\nafter dwelling with rapture on the gorgeous hues of the nearer landscape,\r\nit glides with increasing fervour over the air-drawn bulwarks which tower\r\naround this lovely scene. These choice materials of redundant Nature,\r\ntipped with the magical hues of a gorgeous sunset, and a translucent\r\ntwilight, and invested with the majesty of sweeping yet mellow shadows,\r\nsufficiently account to my own mind for the lengthened description in\r\nwhich I have with all humility indulged.\r\n\r\n              ‘——Expression cannot paint\r\n    The breadth of Nature and her endless bloom.’”[7]\r\n\r\nWhile viewing this magnificent scene from the little Caffé, perched as\r\nclose to the edge of a precipice as the ruined castle itself, it was\r\nimpossible not to recall the words of our immortal bard and country’s\r\nboast—Byron.\r\n\r\n    The castled crag of Drachenfels\r\n    Frowns o’er the wide and winding Rhine,\r\n    Whose breast of waters broadly swells\r\n    Between the banks which bear the vine,\r\n    And hills all rich with blossom’d trees,\r\n    And fields which promise corn and wine:—\r\n    And scatter’d cities crowning these\r\n    Whose far white walls along them shine.\r\n\r\n    The river nobly foams and flows,\r\n    The charm of this enchanted ground,\r\n    And all its thousand turns disclose\r\n    Some fresher beauty varying round!\r\n    The haughtiest breast its wish might bound,\r\n    Through life to dwell delighted here\r\n    Nor could on earth a spot be found\r\n    To Nature and to me more dear.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot the ruined tower of Godesberg, all lonely on a conical\r\nmount, looks like a solitary vidette on his out-post, while the seven\r\nmountains around us—\r\n\r\n          ——like giants stand\r\n    To sentinel enchanted land.\r\n\r\nIt is here that the poetry of the Rhine commences, together with its\r\nlegendary lore, and romantic scenery. After a comfortable breakfast at\r\nthe Eagle’s Nest Inn, and a slight survey of the topography of the rock’s\r\nnarrow crown, I climbed to the highest practicable part of the ruin, and\r\nseating myself securely, had several hours of leisure to contemplate the\r\nscene, and indulge in meditation. On former occasions, I had read the\r\nlegends of the Rhine, while wandering on its banks, more for amusement\r\nthan instruction, yet it never till now crossed my mind that, in the\r\ncomparatively rude ages when they were written, they might have been\r\n_intended_, each to convey some moral lesson. The more I reflected on\r\nthis subject, the more I was impressed with the idea, and, at all events,\r\nI determined to try my hand at the extraction of a moral from each tale,\r\nwhether such moral were originally intended or not. I could not do better\r\nthan begin with the—\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGEND OF THE DRACHENFELS.\r\n\r\n(_No. 1._)\r\n\r\nEvery visitor to this place is shewn the cavern, once occupied by a huge\r\ndragon, to whom the neighbouring inhabitants paid divine honours, and\r\neven offered human sacrifices. The prisoners of war were considered to\r\nbe the most agreeable victims to this Pagan monster. Among a number of\r\nrecent captives was one day found a beautiful young lady, educated in the\r\nChristian religion. Her beauty was raising a quarrel among the conquering\r\nchiefs, when the Elders advised that the cause of the contention should\r\nbe consigned to the dragon. She was accordingly led to the summit of\r\nthe rock, and chained to a tree. Multitudes were assembled to view the\r\nsacrifice. The first rays of the sun that darted into the cavern, roused\r\nthe voracious reptile, who issued from his den, and directed his tortuous\r\ncourse to the usual place of his bloody feast. As soon as he came in\r\nsight, the destined victim drew from her bosom the crucifix and image\r\nof her Saviour—fixed her eyes on the emblem of redemption—and calmly\r\nawaited her fate. The monster gazed on his lovely and helpless prey,\r\nalready within his grasp—slackened his pace—stopped—appeared petrified,\r\nwith his basilisk eyes rivetted on the virgin. She stood as firm as the\r\nrock beneath her or the faith within her! A thrill of horror ran through\r\nthe assembled crowd, and the silence that prevailed was still as the\r\ngrave. The moment of suspense was agonizing to the spectators; but\r\ncontinued only a few seconds, when the dragon sent forth a horrible and\r\nunearthly yell—darted over the precipice—and disappeared for ever! The\r\nmultitude flew to the lady, unbound her chains, and fell at her feet, as\r\nif she were an angel from Heaven. Conversion to the true faith among the\r\nneighbouring people followed—a chapel was erected on the spot where the\r\nmiraculous interposition took place—and it was thenceforth considered the\r\ncradle of Christianity in that part of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this legend is sufficiently obvious. But it goes far\r\nbeyond the miraculous interposition of Providence, too commonly and\r\ntoo impiously proclaimed in Protestant as well as in Catholic states.\r\nThe legend illustrates a great principle of human nature—the power of\r\nreligion over the fear of death—even when that death is aggravated\r\nby the horrors of merciless cruelty and ignominious torture! Nor is\r\nit any drawback on true religion that a _false faith_ will sometimes\r\nexert a similar influence in the hour of trial. The Hindoo widow mounts\r\nthe funeral pyre of her husband, under the influence of a religious\r\npersuasion that she is performing a sacred duty to the dead—and braves\r\nthe devouring element in the hope of joyful immortality. It is also true\r\nthat a few minds of a certain mould will spurn the fear of death, under\r\nthe influence of a greater fear—that of dishonour. The Roman stoics,\r\nwithout the aid of religious faith, might prefer falling on their own\r\nswords, to the disgrace of dragging the captive’s chains behind the\r\ntriumphal chariot of the conqueror:—but neither Cato nor Cassius would\r\nhave stood unmoved before the dragon of Drachenfels.\r\n\r\nThe serenity of the Christian in the hour of peril, the agony of\r\nsickness, and the approach of death, contrasts greatly with the sullen\r\nabandonment of the stoic, and the reckless desperation of the infidel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere my meditations were broken by seeing the long black banner of the\r\nsteamer wreathing over the placid river, and impinging against the sides\r\nof the hills. Descending from my airy seat, I soon joined my companions\r\non the crowded deck, and proceeded on our voyage. It is fashionable for\r\nmodern tourists to draw characteristic sketches of the passengers in\r\nsteam-boats on the Rhine. I think it is one of the worst theatres that\r\ncould be selected for that purpose. The scenery itself, and the legendary\r\ntales which fix the localities in the memory, are quite sufficient for\r\nordinary attention, without attempting to dive into the peculiarities of\r\nindividual character, which are not so easily fathomed as the sentimental\r\ntourist would have us to suppose.\r\n\r\nWe have scarcely got disentangled of the Drachenfels, when we find\r\nourselves between a ruined tower on the summit of a volcanic peak on the\r\nright, and a spruce hotel in the midst of the Rhine, on a little island\r\nto our left. The former is the far-famed Rolandseck, and the latter is\r\nthe ancient convent of Nonnenwerth converted into a modern caravansera.\r\n\r\n\r\nROLAND AND HILDEGUND, OR THE FATAL AFFIANCE.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Second._)\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Hildegund and the valiant Roland (nephew of Charlemagne)\r\nwere ardently beloved by, and betrothed to each other. Roland, however,\r\npostponed his marriage, till he had, once more, unsheathed his sword\r\nagainst the infidels in Palestine. Every day of his absence seemed a year\r\nto his Hildegund, who often listened in her bower to the praises of her\r\nlover carolled by the boatmen of the Rhine. News arrived that the Holy\r\nCity was rescued from the Saracens, and that peace was signed:—But Roland\r\nreturned not. One evening a military knight craved hospitality at her\r\nfather’s castle. He had just returned from the seat of war, and, to eager\r\nenquiries respecting Roland, related the manner of his death on the field\r\nof battle, covered with honourable wounds! The effect on the amiable\r\nHildegund may be easily conceived. After a short noviciate in the convent\r\nof Nonnenwerth, she took the veil, and next morning her lover arrived\r\nat her father’s castle, expecting to fly into her arms! Petrified by\r\nthe astounding intelligence that Hildegund was wedded to Heaven, Roland\r\nabjured all society—built himself a hermitage on the hill overlooking\r\nthe convent, and sat at its door from morning till night, listening to\r\nthe matins and vespers that ascended from the living sepulchre of his\r\nbetrothed. One day he saw a funeral on the island, and soon learnt that\r\nit was that of his Hildegund! The next day he was found dead, sitting at\r\nthe door of his hermitage, his face turned to the convent!\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this tale is homely, but not the less important on that\r\naccount. The misery resulting from long-existing affiances, where time,\r\nor space, or adverse circumstances separate the betrothed, is of daily\r\noccurrence, and comes within the observation of every one. How often do\r\nwe see females kept in this state of uncertainty till every prospect of\r\nother settlement in the world has vanished—and, after all, where the\r\nhappiness of one party is blasted for ever by the death or inconstancy\r\nof the other! Protracted courtships are bad enough; but prospective\r\nmarriages are far worse! Sat verbum sapientibus—or rather _amantibus_.\r\n\r\nA certain personage in the drama of the above legend, is deserving of a\r\npassing word—viz. the eaves-dropper—one of those unlucky tale-bearers,\r\nwhose officious tongues too often destroy the peace of whole families,\r\nand that without _malice prepense_ on the part of the babbler!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAST NUNS OF NONNENWERTH.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Third._)\r\n\r\nThe history of NONNENWERTH discloses a curious trait of human nature,\r\nwhich has seldom been noticed. In the first moral storms of the French\r\nrevolution, a number of nuns and novices of noble families, took refuge\r\nin the Sestertian convent of Nonnenwerth. They remained tranquil\r\ntill Napoleon came to the throne, when a great disaster threatened\r\nto overwhelm their peaceful asylum. The emperor was a calculating\r\nphilosopher, as well as an able general. He foresaw that monasteries\r\nand convents—especially the latter—were bad nurseries for conscripts;\r\nand therefore, in imitation of our Eighth Henry, of blessed and pious\r\nmemory, he suppressed them all, with one stroke of his pen! The nuns\r\nof Nonnenwerth petitioned for an exemption from the proscription,\r\nbut petitioned in vain. Josephine, like Juno, interceded with the\r\nsceptre-bearer, and begged that the convent on the Rhine might be made an\r\nexception to the general rule—that the nuns might be suffered to remain,\r\nand add to their number as death thinned their ranks. Napoleon, like Jove—\r\n\r\n                  “——Accorded half the prayer—\r\n    The rest, the god dispersed in empty air.”\r\n\r\nThey were permitted to retain possession of the convent during their\r\nnatural lives—after which, Nonnenwerth was to revert to the state. This\r\nwas a great concession, and the nuns were satisfied, as they themselves\r\nwere provided for—and some favourable revolution might occur when they\r\nwere gone.\r\n\r\nTime rolled on smoothly,—and, although a sister occasionally paid the\r\ndebt of nature, the event did not make a very serious impression, but\r\nonly afforded topics of reflection on the uncertainty of human life, or\r\nperhaps recalled to the memory of the living some traits of goodness\r\nand amiability in the dead, that had, somehow or other, escaped their\r\nnotice while their sainted sister resided amongst them. But every year\r\ndiminished the number of the survivors, till, at length, the vacant\r\nchambers and the contracted circle at prayers and refection, forced\r\nthemselves on the notice of even the most inobservant of the sisterhood.\r\nAnd now it was that the unwelcome question began to obtrude itself on\r\nthe thoughts of the nuns:—“Who shall go next to her long abode?” It\r\nrequired no great extent of arithmetic to shew the strength of the\r\nestablishment at present, as compared with ten or twelve years before—and\r\neach sister began to assume the office of actuary, and calculate the\r\nprobable duration of life within the walls of the convent! From this\r\ntime, the serenity of their minds was somewhat disturbed. The question\r\nwould obtrude itself on their thoughts, even in their devotions, and rise\r\noccasionally in the troubled dream.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the inexorable tyrant did not fail to knock as regularly at\r\nthe gate of the convent as at the door of the peasant’s hut on the\r\nneighbouring mountain.\r\n\r\n    “Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas\r\n    Regumque turres!”—[8]\r\n\r\nThe social circle was narrowed every year—the number of nuns fell to\r\n20—15—12! About this time a new question, still more appalling than the\r\nother, flashed across the mind of every inmate of Nonnenwerth. It was not\r\nas to who should be the _first_ to—\r\n\r\n    “Leave the warm precincts of the cheerful day,”\r\n\r\nbut who was likely to be the _last_ to wander in solitude round the\r\ndeserted chambers, recalling the well-known features of each departed\r\ntenant,—or, who was to be the _last_ on the bed of sickness or death,\r\nwithout a sister’s smile to soothe her sufferings—or a sister’s tear to\r\nmark the spirit’s flight? This new subject of reflection absorbed all\r\nothers. Even religion failed to calm the troubled imagination of frail\r\nmortals placed in such singular and unnatural circumstances! Any one of\r\nthem could reconcile herself to the idea, however triste, of dying in\r\nsociety—but none of them to the horrible thought of living in solitude,\r\nand departing unwept!\r\n\r\n    “On some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\n    Some pious drops the dying eye requires.”\r\n\r\nThis little community resembled a TONTINE, but with all the advantages\r\nof such an institution completely reversed and turned into calamities.\r\nIn the civil Tontine, every lapse of life renders the remaining lives\r\nmore valuable—in the Tontine of the convent on the Rhine, it rendered\r\nthem more miserable—the consummation, the ultimatum of human misfortunes,\r\nbeing still reserved for—THE LAST NUN OF NONNENWERTH!\r\n\r\nIn one short year of epidemic influence and moral depression, the solemn\r\nrequiem was six times heard in the convent chapel, for the repose of\r\nsouls no longer to be troubled by mundane cares or fears. This reduced\r\nthe sisterhood to six.\r\n\r\nThere are physical pains which the body cannot long sustain—and so are\r\nthere moral prospects on which the eye of reason is unable to dwell.\r\nThis was one of them. The remaining nuns took immediate steps to secure\r\nother asylums—and soon afterwards separated from each other, and from\r\nNonnenwerth—for ever! The island reverted to the state, and the convent\r\nwas converted into a caravansera, whose doors are ever open to the\r\ntravelling novice, without reference to age, sex, creed, or country.\r\n\r\nThis short history will suggest various reflections to the mind. The\r\nlegislator will see that solitude is more formidable to many minds than\r\ndeath itself—while the philanthropist will be convinced that monastic\r\ninstitutions are contrary to nature, and, as such, can never exist,\r\nwithout constant supplies from society at large. The vanity of human\r\nwishes is well illustrated by the history of Nonnenwerth. The nuns\r\nthought themselves fortunate in securing a beautiful, healthy, and\r\ntranquil asylum for life—little knowing how soon the convent would appear\r\nto them more horrible than the dungeon of a prison!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReverting from history to romance, we cannot leave the Seven Mountains\r\nwithout noticing the—\r\n\r\n\r\nTREUENFELS; OR, THE ROCK OF FIDELITY.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Fourth._)\r\n\r\nIn a lonely and desolate valley near the Rhine, some remains of a tomb\r\nare seen, with an inscription, of which the word “LIBA” only is legible.\r\nLiba was the beautiful daughter of the Chevalier Balther, and betrothed\r\nto the brave and amiable Count de Grunstein, whom she loved. But, the\r\n“days of true love seldom do run smooth.” Balther owed a grudge to the\r\npious but severe Englebert, Archbishop of Cologne, and instigated some\r\nof the prelate’s vassals, who were also indisposed to the Archbishop,\r\nto take away his life. Several of the malefactors were seized and\r\nexecuted; all confessing at the scaffold that Balther was the person who\r\nprompted them to the murder. These confessions induced the Emperor to\r\norder a troop of soldiers to burn the original conspirator’s castle and\r\nall within its walls. The order was duly executed, and, in the middle\r\nof a stormy night, the flames ascended to the apartments of Balther\r\nand Liba. The affectionate daughter, with the greatest difficulty, and\r\nwith wonderful presence of mind, conducted her aged father through a\r\nsubterranean passage, to the neighbourhood of the chateau; but not\r\nbefore the old man was dreadfully scorched by the fire. A cavern in\r\nthe mountain’s side afforded them shelter from the vengeance of the\r\nEmperor, and the affectionate daughter sustained her parent by fruits and\r\nroots collected every night in the vicinity of their retreat. Meantime\r\nBalther’s eyes were entirely destroyed by the inflammation resulting\r\nfrom the flames of the castle; but he became reconciled, or at least\r\nresigned, to his afflictions and fate. One day, he begged to be conducted\r\nto the mouth of the cavern, where he might inhale the pure air, though\r\nhe could no longer enjoy the cheerful light of Heaven. The dutiful Liba\r\nindulged the wish of her afflicted father, and, while they were sitting\r\nthere, she espied, at no great distance, her faithful lover, Grunstein,\r\nleaning in melancholy mood against a tree, his javelin and dogs at his\r\nside. The first impulse of nature was to rush into his arms, and implore\r\nhis assistance; but love and reason instantly checked her. She reflected\r\nthat the asylum in Grunstein’s castle would only expose her betrothed\r\nlover to the persecution of the Emperor. At this moment, her father cried\r\nout that he saw the sun and the blue sky, though his eyes were entirely\r\ndestroyed. The maiden looked around, and beheld a black speck in the\r\nheavens. She fell on her knees, and implored the mercy and forgiveness of\r\nthe Almighty towards her parent. Balther joined in the prayer, and, at\r\nthat instant, the thunder roared, and a flash of lightning reduced the\r\nfather to a cinder, and the pious daughter to a corpse! Grunstein roused\r\nfrom his reverie, commenced his descent, and, in his way down into the\r\nvalley, beheld the fair form of his betrothed Liba, apparently asleep—but\r\ntotally lifeless! He erected a chapel on the spot, dedicated to “Notre\r\nDame des Douleurs,” and a tomb in the rock for his Liba, where the name\r\nstill remains legible.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this tale is two-fold. It illustrates the force of filial\r\naffection, and the certainty of retributive justice.\r\n\r\nThe artful instigations of Balther, which induced others to commit\r\nmurder, evaded the law of the land, but did not escape the Eye of\r\nHeaven. The cruel and illegal steps of the Emperor, in burning the\r\ncastle, thus involving the innocent with the guilty, cannot be too\r\nseverely reprobated, though it was consonant with the tyranny of those\r\ndark ages. It may _seem_ inconsistent with divine justice, that the\r\ninnocent and affectionate daughter should have been struck down by the\r\nsame thunderbolt that hurled vengeance on her father’s guilty head. But\r\nalthough “the ways of Providence are dark and intricate” in appearance,\r\nthey are not, as the Roman philosopher asserts, “puzzled in mazes and\r\nperplexed with _errors_.” The amiable Liba may have escaped a life that\r\nmight have been embittered by the memory of her father’s fate, and\r\ntainted, in the eyes of the world, by a father’s crime. She might have\r\ninvolved her faithful lover in ruin—and thus have made a bad exchange of\r\neasy death and eternal happiness, for a lingering existence of misery and\r\ndegradation!\r\n\r\nThe fidelity of Liba, in this legend, is only a fair sample of that\r\nmoral heroism and natural affection, that pervade the breasts of the\r\ndaughter, the mother, and the wife, as compared with those of the son,\r\nthe father, and the husband. The comparison is by no means flattering to\r\nthe “stronger sex.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt a very short distance from Nonnenwerth, we pass the town of UNKEL\r\non our left hand; and here the stream of the Rhine is narrowed by some\r\nremarkable basaltic rocks on the opposite side of the river. These ought\r\nto be observed by those who have not seen specimens of this production\r\nof volcanic fire. It is the same kind of rock as that which is seen at\r\nthe Giant’s Causeway in Ireland, and at Staffa in the Hebrides. These\r\nbasaltic columns had so much obstructed the navigation of the river at\r\nthis place, that some of them were obliged to be blown up, about forty or\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\nPassing by REMAGEN on the right hand, and LINZ on the left, we soon come\r\nto the ruins of Argenfels, close to the banks of the river, with its\r\nlegendary tale, which need not be noticed. Near this we have a specimen\r\nof the FLYING-BRIDGE, so common on this and other continental rivers. A\r\nmooring is fixed in the middle of the stream, from which a long chain\r\nor rope, suspended by small boats at convenient distances, extends to\r\nthe passage-boat, which swings from bank to bank, at the end of this\r\nlong rope, exactly like the pendulum of a clock, only it is horizontal,\r\nnot perpendicular. There is no occasion for oar or sail. The helm of\r\nthe passage-boat being turned to port or starboard, the stream of the\r\nriver acting on it, swings the tail of the pendulum, with its load of\r\npassengers, from one bank to the other in a few minutes. Nothing can\r\nbe more simple or philosophical—but not one in one thousand of the\r\npassengers, up and down the Rhine, comprehend the principle.\r\n\r\nWe soon get so accustomed to “castled crags” and mouldering castles,\r\nthat we are rather surprised, on turning our eyes from the ruins of\r\nArgenfels on our left, to see an ancient chateau (Rheineck) on our\r\nright, resuscitated from the sepulchre of its forefathers, and perched\r\nin new life on an airy cliff. An old tower stands at one end, like the\r\nhead-stone of a grave, reminding the modern mansion that it too will be a\r\nruin in its turn!\r\n\r\nRheineck has undergone some of the transmigrations of Vishnou. It was a\r\nRoman fort, and bore the imperial eagle on its banner. Then it became a\r\nrobber’s castle, and received the spoils of its master, torn from their\r\nrightful owners. And now it is the residence of a philosopher (Professor\r\nHolweg)—the seat of science, letters, and humanity. It is said to be\r\nconstructed in strict imitation of the castles of feudalism on the\r\nRhine. But although Rheineck has changed masters, it is still under the\r\nprotection of the same tutelar divinity—MERCURY, among his other numerous\r\navocations, having been the god of letters as well as of robbers.\r\n\r\n    Qui feros cultus hominum recentum,\r\n    Voce formasti, catus et decoræ\r\n                                more Palestræ.\r\n\r\nPassing by Brohl on the right, we come to one of the most imposing and\r\nextensive ruins on the left—the shattered and scattered fragments of\r\nHammerstein Castle, crowning the mount and craggy rocks of the same name.\r\nThe precipices descend in rugged and jutting promontories to the shores\r\nof the Rhine, each crowned with some remains of the ancient royal and\r\nmagnificent chateau, and presenting scanty terraces of the vine, creeping\r\nup the crevices.\r\n\r\nWe soon afterwards range along the ancient town of ANDERNACH, the ruins\r\nof which, with modern towers and spires, are backed and flanked by a\r\nvast screen of basaltic mountains of sombre hue and antique grandeur.\r\nHere Drusus Germanicus erected one of his fifty towers, in his Rheinish\r\ncampaigns, and in the time of Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe banks of the river now become more approximated, and the stream\r\nmore rapid. Steam, however, bids defiance to stream, and the vessel\r\nploughs its way, though with greatly retarded velocity. There is but\r\nlittle remarkable between this and Coblentz, except the beautiful\r\nlittle town of NEIWIED, with its flying-bridge, near which Julius Cæsar\r\ncrossed the Rhine—and, eighteen centuries afterwards, General Hoche,\r\nwith the victorious French army, performed the same feat, but with far\r\nmore difficulty. Here the Jew and the Gentile—the Protestant and the\r\nCatholic—the Quaker and the Sceptic—all live upon equal terms, and with\r\nequal rights, unmolested in the free enjoyment of their various beliefs\r\nor disbeliefs—and travelling quietly towards the grave, or whatever\r\n“undiscovered country” may lie beyond that bourne, without jostling each\r\nother on the road, or forcing their creeds down the throats of their\r\nreluctant neighbours!\r\n\r\nWhen will the “liberty of conscience,” in our own proud country, be\r\nuncoupled with inequality of political rights, or unattended by the\r\nrancour of the ODIUM THEOLOGICUM!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBLENTZ.\r\n\r\nThe cities, towns, villages, hamlets, and even the houses along the\r\nRhine, bear a closer resemblance to one another (each in its class)\r\nthan in any part of the world through which I have wandered. Even the\r\nold castles, and the rocks on which they are built, are often such\r\nfac-similes of each other—that it is next to impossible for the acutest\r\nperception, joined with the most retentive memory, to retain distinct\r\nideas of these objects, passing in rapid succession before the eye of the\r\ntourist!—\r\n\r\nCOBLENTZ, like Macedon, has a river—nay, a brace of them—one brown,\r\nthe other blue.[9] As necessary consequences, there are two bridges,\r\nas unlike one another, as any two things of the same kind can well be.\r\nOne rests its foundations on the rocky bed of the Moselle—the other on\r\nthe turbid surface of the Rhine. There is a number of streets—a great\r\nnumber of houses—and a still greater number of people, amounting to\r\nsome 12,000. Then there are churches enough, considering the number of\r\nchurch-goers—and in some of them, there are more dead bodies present\r\nat divine service, than living souls. There is a palace—not that of a\r\nprince, but of justice. There is good water and good wine; but both\r\nof them are brought over the Moselle bridge. Of hotels, there is no\r\nlack; the masters and “_kellners_” of which can tell a “hawk from a\r\nhandsaw”—and more than that, they can distinguish an Englishman from a\r\nnative, as readily as they can a Thaler from a Kreutzer. Coblentz has\r\nevidently more strength than wealth—more soldiers than merchants—more\r\nshells than yolks—more articles of war than of commerce. Her high\r\nloop-holed walls along the banks of the river, with one or two wharves,\r\nshew that she is compressed into a military fortress, rather than\r\nexpanded into a fine mart of commerce!\r\n\r\n\r\nEHRENBREITSTEIN.\r\n\r\nThe following are the sentiments of two pictorial artists. “The whole\r\nsurface of the rock, glowed with the richest hues of sunset—its naturally\r\ndeep-toned and richly coloured form assuming an endless diversity of\r\ntints combined with a focus of harmonious light, and relieved by the\r\nbroad shadows of the surrounding objects.”—_Leigh._\r\n\r\n“We behold the mighty and stupendous rock of Ehrenbreitstein, crowned\r\nwith fortifications—_the Gibraltar of the Rhine_—rising in towering\r\nmajesty, and frowning in sullen grandeur on the beautiful and picturesque\r\ncity of Coblentz, casting its deep and darkened shadow over the calm and\r\nglassy surface of the Rhine beneath.”—_Tomlinson._\r\n\r\nI have been often past, and sometimes over this “broad stone of\r\nhonour,” and, I confess that, to my eye, it is about as shapeless and\r\nunpicturesque a mass of mountain as I ever beheld. It is a huge truncated\r\ncone—the lower-fourth of an enormous sugar-loaf—an Egyptian pyramid, cut\r\ndown to the first floor—or rather it is a gigantic butcher’s block, on\r\nwhich a good bit of _mangling_ has been done in its time. There is really\r\nbut little that excites interest about the fortress, except its massive\r\nand passive strength—its _vis inertiæ_—its impenetrability by shot or\r\nshells. You might as well batter BEN NEVIS as Ehrenbreitstein! You might\r\nsweep its rugged brow of every man, mortar, parapet, and bastion, but\r\nthe rugged, dogged rock would stand in all its “brute force,” unmoved by\r\nthe iron showers that fell on its head!\r\n\r\n“The GIBRALTAR of the Rhine!” No man who ever viewed that renowned\r\nfortress, would have made the comparison. I resided on the rock several\r\nmonths, and every feature of it is as fresh in my mind’s eye, as it was\r\n40 years ago, when I last left it. Imagine a gigantic rock rising out of\r\nthe ocean to a height of fifteen hundred feet, connected with the main\r\nland only by a narrow, low isthmus of sand—with three sides perpendicular\r\n(North, East, and South), and one sloping at an angle of 45 degrees from\r\nthe summit of the mountain to the water’s edge, sprinkled with little\r\ngardens and lodges—while the sea-line is bristled with batteries and\r\nflanked by spit-fire tongues, bearing the heaviest artillery, behind\r\nwhich lies a town, containing specimens of every nation between the\r\nGanges and the Atlantic. Through the perpendicular cliffs that overhang\r\nthe neutral ground, vast galleries for cannon, and profound excavations\r\nfor ammunition, are cut, tier over tier, pointing destruction upon every\r\nfoot of the isthmus below. Then the ruins of the old Moorish castle,\r\nperched on the crags at one extremity of the rock, while EUROPA POINT,\r\na high table-land a hundred feet above the level of the sea, stretches\r\nout to the South, like a splendid parade, with barracks, hospitals, &c.\r\nBut oh! from O’Hara’s tower on the summit, what a glorious prospect! The\r\nboundless and tideless Mediterranean to the East—the vast and heaving\r\nAtlantic to the West—the fantastic mountains of Grenada to the North—and\r\nAfrica fading away towards Carthage and Algiers to the South.\r\n\r\nThere is not, there cannot be a spot on this earth where such an\r\nextensive, magnificent, varied, and beautiful view (one hundred miles in\r\nradius) can be obtained, as from the summit of Gibraltar—a spot unique,\r\nbetween two mighty oceans, and two great continents—having Africa and\r\nEurope, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, as it were, at your feet!\r\n\r\nIs it nothing to stand on one of the “PILLARS OF HERCULES” and\r\ncontemplate the other within a few miles of you? Descending into St.\r\nMichael’s cave, near the apex of the rock, we find ourselves surrounded\r\nby thousands and tens of thousands of stalactitic figures, assuming the\r\ngrotesque forms of everything which the most fertile imagination could\r\nconceive—dispersed through caverns where human step has never been able\r\nto trace the depth or extent—and supposed to form subterranean, or rather\r\nsubmarine, communications with the opposite fortress of Ceuta in Africa!\r\nWander through the town, and you will observe the costume, the language,\r\nthe manners, the habits, the productions, the features—almost the\r\npassions and thoughts of every people on earth—from the Calmuc Tartar of\r\nthe East, to the Red Indian of the West—from the Laplander of the North,\r\nto the Hottentot of the South. To compare Gibraltar with Ehrenbreitstein,\r\nthen, is to compare “Hyperion with a Satyr”—or Vesuvius with the\r\nfunnel of a steam-boat. I leave the prodigies of valour performed by\r\nEnglishmen, in taking and retaining the key of the Mediterranean, out\r\nof the question, believing that Prussian arms would, under similar\r\ncircumstances, have achieved equal exploits. Of all nations, _we_ have\r\nthe least reason to doubt the prowess of Prussia. She fought at our side,\r\nwhen the destinies of Europe vibrated in the balance!\r\n\r\n\r\nCOBLENTZ TO MAYENCE.\r\n\r\nBetween Cologne and Coblentz it is mere child’s play for the tourist.\r\nThe stream is wide, and the attractive objects are so reasonably distant\r\nfrom one another, that the traveller has time to consult his map, peruse\r\nSchreiber, and even con over some of the shorter legends, between castle\r\nand castle. But it is another affair above Coblentz. The stream becomes\r\nmore confined and tortuous—the banks more abrupt and contiguous—the\r\nruins, towns, and villages more numerous—the embarkations and\r\ndebarkations more frequent, with all their consequences of hurly-burly\r\namong the passengers, topsyturvy of luggage, scrambling after books,\r\ncharts, and sacs-de-nuits, bowings, kissings, and embracings, or, as\r\nHood would say, “omni-bussings,” among goers and comers, together with\r\nthe clattering of plates and dishes, and the chattering of all known and\r\nunknown tongues—these, and many other interruptions, sadly discompose\r\nthe contemplations of the philosopher, and the musing meditations of the\r\ntourists in pursuit of the picturesque, or the Syntaxes in search of the\r\nsublime.\r\n\r\nThe “Rhenish Confederacy” must have had a most salutary influence in\r\nfraternising the people of these provinces. Not only does every German\r\nin the steamer salute his “cousin Germans” on both cheeks; but, if\r\nhis neck were long enough, he would kiss every man, woman, and child,\r\non both banks of the river, from Cologne to Constance! These palpable\r\ninosculations, however, being impracticable, the caps and hats are\r\nconverted into social telegraphs, which\r\n\r\n    “Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,”\r\n\r\nand establish a chain of sympathies and reciprocities between land and\r\nwater along the whole course of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOLZENFELS.\r\n\r\nWe have proceeded but a little way above Coblentz, when we find ourselves\r\nbetween two remarkable ruins—one on the banks of the Lahn, (Lahenec), and\r\none on our right—STOLZENFELS. This last has a short legend attached to\r\nit, which may be glanced at, _en passant_.\r\n\r\nThe robber chief of this strong-hold was remarkable, even among the\r\nRhine-robbers, for cruelty and ferocity. This was not all. He contemned\r\nthe gods, and laughed at religion as the superstition of the ignorant.\r\nIn the intervals of robbery and murder, he amused himself with tormenting\r\nhis vassals, whose lives hung upon the mere caprice of their tyrant\r\nlord. One evening, while carousing and scoffing, the light of the moon\r\nwas suddenly obscured—flocks of ravens flew screaming through the\r\nair—darkness overspread the Rhine—and distant thunder was heard growling\r\namong the mountains. The Stolzenburger turned pale, and, for the first\r\ntime in his life, fell on his knees to pray. Before he could utter a\r\nword, a dreadful crash was heard—a thunderbolt had struck the castle—and\r\nthe tyrant was buried in the ruins!\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nA death-bed repentance may be better than none; but that piety which is\r\nextorted by terror, hardly deserves the name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe long and straight reach of the river, from the entrance of the Lahn\r\nto the chateau of Liebneck, presents no striking feature, except the\r\nfrowning castle (now an hospital) of MARKSBURG, crowning an apparently\r\ninaccessible mountain, which modern art might render impregnable. In\r\nanother reach or two, we pass Boppart, and come to the scene of a\r\nlegendary tale.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROTHERS; OR, LIEBENSTEIN AND STERNFELS.\r\n\r\n“The course of true love never did run smooth.”\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Fifth._)\r\n\r\nA little above BOPPART, but on the opposite side of the river, two\r\nmouldering ruins, on two craggy rocks, close to each other, arrest the\r\nattention of even the most indifferent passenger. The legend attached\r\nto them is of a very melancholy character. A nobleman had two sons and\r\nan amiable ward, of whom both of the brothers were enamoured. The elder\r\nresigned his pretensions, and retired to Rheuse, a part of the family\r\nestate. The younger was affianced to, and beloved by, the beautiful\r\nward, ELOISE, whose name deserves to be transmitted to posterity. The\r\nHoly, but insane Crusades, however, induced the intended bridegroom to\r\njoin the military bigots of that day, in a war of extermination against\r\nthe Musselmen. The result of his religious zeal was the conquest—not\r\nof the Holy City, but of a Grecian mistress, with whom he returned to\r\nhis castle on the Rhine. The elder brother (Liebenstein), incensed at\r\nthis double crime (profanation of the crusade and breach of his vows to\r\nthe lady), challenged him to mortal conflict. The amiable ward (Louisa)\r\nrushed between the combatants—prevented fratricide—and immediately took\r\nthe veil. The guilty pair led, at first, a riotous, but soon a wretched\r\nlife. The Grecian lady proved faithless, and eloped! The brothers became\r\nreconciled—lived in the contiguous castles, whose ruins are still\r\nseen—and died without issue!—The property of the ward was dedicated\r\nto the purpose of founding a convent (Bornhoffen) at the foot of the\r\nmountain on which the castles were built. As to the brothers—\r\n\r\n    They never enter’d court or town,\r\n      Nor looked on woman’s face,\r\n    But childless to the grave went down,\r\n      The last of all their race.\r\n    And still upon the mountain fair,\r\n      Are seen two castles gray,\r\n    That, like their lords, together there\r\n      Sink slowly to decay.[10]\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nThe darker features of this drama are every day seen on the stage of\r\nlife. Lovers’ vows plighted, soon to be broken—man’s promises of eternal\r\nlove cancelled—women’s hopes and happiness blighted—but perfidy sooner or\r\nlater punished.\r\n\r\nIt was enough for Sternfels to bring home a mistress from Palestine,\r\nwithout parading his guilty partner before the eyes of his betrothed and\r\ninsulted Louisa. Yet this, _and worse_, we every day witness! Sternfels’\r\npunishment was not light. The ingratitude of his mistress, and a life of\r\nsolitude and remorse, were severe chastisements!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWinding along from the ruins last-mentioned, we come to a very striking\r\nobject, a little short of St. Goar, which attracts the attention of all\r\npassengers. It is a dismantled fortification, still black with the powder\r\nby which it was blown up in the French revolution. The RHEINFELS was\r\nlong a robber-fortress of the first water, and its tyrant chiefs carried\r\ntheir depredations and extortions to such a height as to league all the\r\nadjacent provinces against them. The chiefs held out and defied the\r\ncountry; but at length the strong-hold fell—and, with it, the whole of\r\nthe brigand castles on both sides of the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\nLURLEY, OR THE ECHO.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Sixth._)\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after passing the ruins of the Rheinfels, we enter a\r\nnarrow and sombre river gorge, where the stream is impetuous, turbulent,\r\nand tortuous; the cliffs of dark basalt rising almost perpendicular,\r\nbut in rugged strata or layers, inclining in all directions from the\r\nhorizontal to nearly the vertical. Here the Rhine like its sister the\r\nRhone—\r\n\r\n                  ——“Cleaves its way between\r\n    Rocks that appear like lovers who have parted\r\n    In haste; whose mining depths so intervene,\r\n    That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted.”\r\n\r\nAnd here is still heard that prattling nymph, Miss ECHO, who, like many\r\na descriptive tourist, repeats her parrot-note for the tenth time—with\r\nno other variation than that of diminished force and distinctness. This\r\nlady, who, when young, was dismissed from the skies for allowing her\r\ntongue to wag too freely, has since endured the severe punishment of\r\nkeeping silent, except when spoken to! She is not permitted to ask, but\r\nonly to iterate questions—having the privilege, on some rare occasions,\r\nand in some peculiar places, of repeating the said question, or rather\r\nthe last word or syllable of it twice or even many times. The present\r\nspot is one of these favourite localities—and the voices which she\r\nloves to hear and to imitate are those of the cannon, the bugle, and\r\nthe horn. The clanking and plashing of the steamers are unfavourable to\r\nthe delicate iterations of Echo, and often drown her voice entirely.\r\nThough not so witty as her sister of Killarney, who answers, instead of\r\nrepeating the questions put to her, yet she occasionally cracks a joke on\r\nthe mayor of the neighbouring town, when some stentorian German bawls out\r\nfrom the opposite rock, “_Who is the mayor of Oberwesel?_” The damsel,\r\nwith a faint but clear titter, replies, “_esel_”—or ass! so that lord\r\nmayors on the banks of the Rhine, as well as of the Thames, are sometimes\r\ntreated with ridicule.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that boat-wrecks, raft-wrecks, and loss of\r\nlife were of frequent occurrence in a locality like this, where the\r\nrapid stream is twisted into whirlpools, between rugged banks, the very\r\nproximity of which increases the difficulty of the passage, and the\r\ndanger of drowning, where the vessel or flotilla is stranded. The eddying\r\nsurge, the sunken rock, and the serrated perpendicular shore, in a dark\r\nand tempestuous night, must render the navigation of this dreary ravine\r\nmost hazardous—and escape, in case of an overturn, all but hopeless.\r\n\r\nThat a place so singular and so perilous, coupled with a remarkable and\r\nmusical echo, should become the scene of some popular or superstitious\r\nlegend, is not at all wonderful. Accordingly a fourth SIREN was added to\r\nthe classical list, and located on the banks of the Rhine, instead of the\r\ncoast of Sicily, to lure (lurlei) the enchanted mariner from his helm or\r\noar, by her melodious song, and wreck himself and bark on the treacherous\r\nrocks. Lurley carried on the trade of her elder sisters for some time,\r\nwith considerable success, but not without some redeeming qualities; for\r\nshe often pointed out the best places for the poor fishermen to cast\r\ntheir nets. At length a young Palatine Count determined to emulate the\r\nhero of Ithaca, and break the spell of the enchantress. For that purpose\r\nhe embarked on the Rhine, and steered towards the dangerous pass, but\r\nwithout taking the precaution of the wily Greek, to stop the ears of\r\nthe crew with wax, and cause himself to be bound to the mast. As the\r\ncount’s barge approached the rocks, Lurley poured forth one of her most\r\nmelodious lays over the face of the river. The men dropped their oars,\r\nand the count’s senses were all absorbed in listening to the divine\r\nstrains. A sudden eddy of the stream whirled the boat’s head towards the\r\nshore—another dashed her against the rocks—and, in another instant, all\r\nwere engulphed in the boiling whirlpool!\r\n\r\nThis catastrophe caused a great sensation, and the count’s father sent a\r\nveteran warrior, with a select party of soldiers, to surround the rock,\r\nand seize the sorceress. On approaching the summit, Lurley was seen for\r\nthe first time by human eyes, with arms, ankles, and neck encircled with\r\ncorals, and even her flowing tresses braided with the same emblems of the\r\ndeep. She demanded their purpose. The veteran announced his determination\r\nto force her into the Rhine, there to expiate the death of the young\r\ncount. Lurley replied, by throwing her corals into the river, singing at\r\nthe same time—\r\n\r\n    Entends ma voix, puissant Pere des eaux,\r\n    Fais parter, sans delai, tes rapides chevaux.\r\n\r\nInstantly a great storm arose—the river boiled with foam—and two towering\r\nwaves, bearing some resemblance to milk-white steeds, surged along the\r\nrock, and bore UNDINE (for such was the nymph) to her paternal grottoes\r\nunder the waters. From that time the song of Lurley was never heard; but\r\nher spirit still hovers about her favourite rocks, and mimicks the voices\r\nof the boatmen as they pass the place.\r\n\r\nThe veteran warrior returned to the count’s father, and was agreeably\r\nsurprised to find the son safely returned to his paternal mansion by the\r\nkind UNDINE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA contemplation of this locality irresistibly leads me to the conclusion\r\nthat, here existed in some remote period, a cataract, similar to that\r\nnow existing, but rapidly crumbling down, as at Schaffhausen. The\r\nalluvial plains between Heidelberg and the present bed of the Rhine,\r\nwere unquestionably a large lake, which would be drained by the wearing\r\ndown of a cataract at some lower part of the river. When the falls of\r\nthe Rhine at Schaffhouse are reduced to mere rapids, it is probable that\r\nthe lake of Constance will become an alluvial valley. The valley of the\r\nRhone was once a lake, till the flood-gate at St. Maurice gave way, and\r\nconverted the lake into a plain. The huge walls of basaltic rock piled up\r\nin strata on each side of the Rhine at Lurley, torn by fire and worn by\r\nwater, draw the mind to contemplate the myriads of years which must have\r\nrolled along, since first they upsprung from the bowels of the earth in\r\nliquid lava—and the countless ages required to form this sombre gorge by\r\nthe mere attrition of the unceasing current!\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOMBERG.\r\n\r\nWhile passing the picturesque little town of Oberwesel, and just beyond\r\nthe Lurley-rocks, we raise the eye to the ruins of SCHOMBERG, possessing\r\nsome interest to the British traveller, as the patrimonial castle of\r\nDuke Schomberg, who lost his life in the battle of the Boyne. Alas!\r\nthat the very name of a mouldering ruin should, after the lapse of a\r\ncentury and a half, engender in the breasts of the same people, living\r\nunder the same government, professing the same religion, speaking the\r\nsame language, and having the same interests, such deadly sentiments of\r\nhatred and animosity! No two feudal robbers and enemies on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, ever viewed each other with such cut-throat propensities, as\r\ndo the Orange-man and White-boy on the banks of the Boyne! A century\r\nand a half hence, when the fiery passions of the present day shall\r\nhave long been quenched in the grave, and the immortal spirits shall\r\nbe awaiting the verdict of a final tribunal, posterity will scarcely\r\nbelieve that, amongst their ancestors, Christian charity meant murderous\r\nextermination—and that the surest road to Heaven was that which was\r\ntracked with the blood of our neighbours! The glorious orb of day shines\r\nas joyously over those mouldering ruins, as when the proud castle first\r\nrose in majesty over the frowning precipices—nay, as when the Rhine\r\nitself first began to trickle from the virgin snows of the Alps:—and why\r\nshould not the heavenly light of Christianity shed its benign influence\r\nover the professors of that faith, as well now, as when the REDEEMER\r\ninculcated charity and forbearance during his mission on earth? No! It\r\nis much easier to preach than to practise the Christian virtues—and the\r\nformer is considered the more efficacious of the two, by the disciples of\r\nFAITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN SISTERS; OR, THE FATE OF COQUETTES.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Seventh._)\r\n\r\nCUPID is not a god that may be safely tampered with. His arrows are\r\nsharp, his feelings are keen, and his resentments are sometimes\r\nimplacable. Seven beautiful sisters resided in the castle of Schomberg,\r\noverhanging the Rhine; and their hearts were as insensible to love as\r\nare the seven rocks in that river near Oberwesel, which now bear their\r\nnames. Their charms and their wealth attracted crowds of suitors from\r\nvarious quarters. The sisters, however, gave smiles to all, yet favours\r\nto none of their admirers. Proffers of marriage were always declined,\r\nand sometimes treated with levity. Vanity was their ruling, almost their\r\nonly passion, and adulation was its food. Their public suitors were the\r\nsubjects of their private merriment. But mischief sometimes mingled with\r\ntheir mirth. By words, looks, or demeanour, they occasionally seemed to\r\nshew a preference to certain of their admirers. This led to jealousies,\r\nquarrels, bloodshed, and even death. The ranks, however, were constantly\r\nfilled up by adventurous and ardent lovers, as the Byzantine throne\r\n(according to Gibbon) was never without a tenant, though the grave was\r\nalways ready dug at its foot! But beauty, which is the gift of Nature\r\nand Chance, is the first charm which falls before the hand of Time. The\r\nsisters had only this one personal attraction, and it began to fade. The\r\nsuitors diminished in number, and at length totally disappeared! It was\r\nthen too late to remedy the evil of their own vanity and cruelty. The\r\nscene of their former flattery had now become insupportable, and they\r\nprepared to remove across the Rhine to a sequestered retreat, where their\r\nwounded pride and present humiliation might alike be buried in obscurity.\r\nThey selected a dark night for leaving their castle and passing the\r\nriver. When near the LURLEY ROCKS, the gnome of that place, who had\r\noften witnessed the imprudent and unfeeling conduct of her neighbouring\r\nsisters, lured the boatmen towards a treacherous sunken shoal, when\r\nthe vessel was overturned, and all were buried in a watery grave! The\r\nSeven Sisters are still seen occasionally, in very low states of the\r\nriver, raising their heads out of the water, in the form of rocks, and\r\nstruggling with the foaming and impetuous current!\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nThe moral of this short legend is transparent. The coquette, the flirt,\r\nthe jilt, is a kind of moral swindler who, having no feelings or\r\naffections herself, trifles with those of others. It must be confessed\r\nthat there are similar characters among the other sex, who are, if\r\npossible, still more reprehensible. But the female who plays this\r\ndisreputable game, runs a greater risk, for obvious reasons, than the\r\nmale deceiver. The foregoing legend illustrates the danger of relying on\r\nmere personal charms, as the great magnet of attraction. Qualities and\r\naccomplishments of mind are more durable, and more to be depended on,\r\nthan beauty of form or feature!\r\n\r\n\r\nPFALZ.\r\n\r\nThe robbers of the Rhine were not content with building depôts for\r\nstolen, or rather plundered goods, on every eminence, and levying\r\n“black mail” on every kind of land carriage; but they invaded “the free\r\nnavigation of the Rhine,” as some of their descendants now do. A rock\r\non the river whereon to erect a toll-bar was a great treasure in days\r\nof yore. The quadrupeds of the mouse-tower were much less voracious and\r\ngraminivorous, than the bipeds of the same. The latter might not perhaps\r\nhave nibbled at the body of a bishop, but they took good care to shear\r\nhis flocks, in their transit up and down the Rhine. Nearly opposite CAUB\r\nwe pass close to an object which looks like a dwarf castle, sailing up\r\nthe stream on the back of a whale. This was a very convenient edifice\r\nfor the Rhenish palatines of the adjacent castle of _Stahlee_. It served\r\nthe purpose of a custom-house, to collect the “rint,” and a prison to\r\nsecure the refractory:—in other words, it performed the double function\r\nof dungeon and douane. One of the involuntary tenants of this narrow\r\ncrib, was the own and the only daughter of Conrad, the palatine himself,\r\nwhose name was Agnes. The lady had been betrothed, with her parents’ and\r\nher own consent, to Henry Duke of Brunswick; but a king having offered\r\nhis hand, Conrad commanded her to change her affections, and set them\r\non a higher rank than that of a duke. Agnes demurred in her own breast,\r\nthough not openly; for affection, like faith or belief, will not come\r\nor go at our own bidding—much less at that of another. In the temporary\r\nabsence of the father, Agnes, with the consent and privity of her\r\nmother, was privately married to the duke. When Conrad learnt this, he\r\nordered his daughter to the Pfalz, till the marriage could be dissolved.\r\nMeantime it soon became evident that certain proofs of prior attachment\r\non the part of Agnes, would be too unequivocal to escape the notice of\r\nthe regal suitor, if the marriage were annulled; and Conrad, after a\r\ndouble confinement of Agnes in the Rhine prison, became reconciled to the\r\nduke—and all ended happily.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPassing BACHARACH and the “ARA BACCHI,” which shews its propitious face\r\nin fertile vintages, we soon come to LORCH, where we have a legend that\r\nmust not be passed unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPTATION, OR THE HALL OF A HUNDRED MIRRORS.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Eighth._)\r\n\r\nThree students from Nuremburg, determined, during one of their vacations,\r\nto make the tour of the Rhine. Arrived at Lorch, they learnt that the\r\nsombre and triste valley of Wesperthal, behind Mount Kedrick, was\r\nthe habitation of hobgoblins, who failed not to harass and frighten\r\nevery one who penetrated into its dreary recesses. This account only\r\nstimulated their curiosity, and tempted their courage. They therefore\r\nrepaired to the valley, and were soon treading on fairy ground. While\r\nwandering about, they came to an enormous mass of rock, bearing some\r\nrude resemblance to an old castle. In its sides were several apertures,\r\nlike gothic windows, and its summit was something in the shape of a\r\ndome. Presently at one of these apertures there appeared three young\r\nladies of surpassing beauty, who, instead of frowning on the young\r\ncavaliers, invited them, by their smiles and signals, to approach the\r\ncastle. They soon found a narrow door, through which they entered, and\r\npassing along a kind of avenue, they came to a stair-case, which they\r\nmounted, and entered a vast and magnificent vestibule. They had scarcely\r\ntime to cast a glance around them, when they were involved in the most\r\nCimmerian darkness. After groping about, for some time, they discovered\r\na door, which they managed to force open, when they found themselves in\r\na splendid hall, illumined by hundreds of chandeliers, and covered from\r\nthe dome to the floor with brilliant mirrors. But instead of finding\r\nthe three nymphs, who had beckoned them from the windows, they were\r\nastounded by the sight of at least three hundred, who all stretched out\r\ntheir hands, at once, while welcoming the three youths to their father’s\r\nmansion! The students were stupified, not knowing which to address,\r\nor whom to salute, so bewildered were they by the reflection of three\r\nhundred beauties, and double that number of hands, from the surrounding\r\nmirrors! Their embarrassment was not lessened by the peals of laughter\r\nset up by the mischievous nymphs. In the midst of this scene, a door\r\nopened, and a venerable old man, with locks like snow, but clothed in\r\njet black vestments, entered. “Welcome, my children,” said he; “you are\r\ncome, no doubt, to demand my daughters in marriage. You shall have them,\r\nand with each a hundred weight of solid gold. But there is one condition.\r\nMy daughters have lost their pet birds, and you must search for them,\r\nand bring them back from yonder wood.” “_Take each your partner_,” then\r\nsaid the old man, in a voice of thunder. The youths stepped forward,\r\neach to seize the hand of his mistress—but grasped only empty air. At\r\nthis, the father joined his daughters in a peal of laughter. When the\r\nmerriment had subsided, the old man led the young suitors to the real\r\nnymphs, whose salutes assured the students that they were real flesh and\r\nblood, and whose beauty soon captivated their whole souls. They were now\r\neager to fulfil the condition imposed upon them. “You will recognize the\r\nSTARLING,” says the old man, “by the riddles which it has got by rote\r\nand is always propounding—the ROOK by its hoarse croak—and the MAGPIE,\r\nby the burthen of its chatter, being the birth, parentage, and education\r\nof its grandmother.” They set out for the forest, and soon found the\r\nthree birds, perched on the branch of an oak, chattering and chanting the\r\nditties which they had been taught in the chateau. I have only room for\r\nthe magpie’s theme—\r\n\r\n    “Ma grand-mêre etait une pie,\r\n    Qui pondait des œufs d’ou sortaient des pies.\r\n    Et si elle n’etait pas morte,\r\n    Elle serait encore en vie.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe young gentlemen soon secured the pet birds, and returned with them\r\nto the castle. But what a change presented itself to their horrified\r\nsenses! The chateau was gray with moss—the hall deprived of its mirrors\r\nand lustres, and only exhibiting naked walls! In three niches, sate\r\nthree withered, tawny, toothless hags, with wine and fruit before them,\r\non three small tables! They instantly rose, and stretched out their\r\nwrinkled, yellow, and skinny arms to embrace their lovers, while they\r\nmumbled and snivelled, from mouths and noses, their nauseous welcomes,\r\nand most loving assurances of eternal attachment and fidelity! To add\r\nto the mortification of the bridegrooms, the three pet birds joined\r\ntheir mistresses in such a chorus of squallings, croakings, and\r\ncatterwaullings, that the young men were obliged to stop their ears to\r\nkeep out the infernal din! Meanwhile the withered witches led their\r\nparamours to the tables, and presented them refreshments, for which they\r\nhad little stomach. Each, however, took a glass of exquisite wine, which\r\nthey had scarcely swallowed, when they fell into a state of complete\r\ninsensibility! When they awoke, which was not till mid-day, they found\r\nthemselves lying among prickly bushes at the foot of a tall rock, worn\r\ninto furrows by the storms and rains, their limbs so cold and stiff that\r\nthey had the greatest difficulty in retracing their steps! While dragging\r\ntheir weary limbs along, they were saluted from every projecting rock\r\nby the old hags—and from every branch of tree by the chatterings and\r\ncroakings of the cursed pet birds! On clearing the valley, the young\r\ngentlemen made a vow never again to pay attention to the allurements of\r\nfemale beauty, when proffered on the “voluntary system” of the nymphs of\r\nWESPERTHAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nI think the allegory of Wesperthal is little inferior to that of CIRCE,\r\nor even of the Syrens. It combines, indeed, the morals of both. Under\r\nthe head of curiosity and thirst of rash adventure, are shadowed forth\r\nthe headstrong passions of youth. Then the allurements and temptations\r\nby which they are so easily led from the paths of virtue—the Cimmerian\r\ndarkness in which they are plunged—the blaze of false light, glittering\r\ntinsel, and meretricious splendour that attracts them on to their\r\nruin—the penalties which are soon exacted from this short-lived\r\nfelicity—the stupor in which their senses are drowned—and the remorse and\r\nhorror in which they finally wake from the delirium of “passion’s wild\r\ncareer.”\r\n\r\nAmong some sly strokes of irony conveyed in this allegory, the\r\naccomplishments of the “pet birds” are biting satires on the education\r\nand mental habits of their mistresses in the chateaus of that time.\r\nHappily for us, there are _now_ no charades of the starling, croakings of\r\nthe rook, or magpie chatterings about ancestral honours, among the wives\r\nand daughters of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL’S LADDER.\r\n\r\nRUTHELM AND GARLINDA, OR LOVE REWARDED AND INHOSPITALITY PUNISHED.\r\n\r\n“Omnia vincit amor.”\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Ninth._)\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a doubt that the legend of the “DEVIL’S LADDER,” was\r\nclearly intended to convey a double moral, as will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nOver the little town of LORCH, rises abruptly the craggy, and apparently\r\ninaccessible mountain of KEDRICK, on which is a solitary tower. SIBO,\r\nthe Chief of Lorch, was a gloomy, eccentric, and rather misanthropic\r\ncharacter. One stormy night, a decrepid old creature, of extremely\r\ndwarfish stature, rapped at his door, and demanded the usual rights of\r\nhospitality, commonly accorded in that age of chivalry. SIBO drove him\r\nfrom his gate with rudeness, and even brutality. Next day, when the\r\ndinner-bell rang, GARLINDA, the only child of SIBO, a beautiful girl,\r\ntwelve years of age, was nowhere to be found! Search was made in all\r\ndirections, but in vain. A shepherd, however, reported that, early in the\r\nmorning, he saw a young girl, who was culling flowers at the foot of the\r\nKedrick, surrounded and seized by a number of little old men, who climbed\r\nwith her up the mountain. The chevalier cast his eyes towards the summit\r\nof the steep, and clearly discerned his daughter there, who appeared to\r\nbe stretching her arms towards her parent’s habitation! The vassals were\r\nsummoned, and numerous efforts were made to scale the rock; but every\r\nattempt was frustrated by fragments of stone coming down the precipices\r\nwith such fury, that the men were forced to fly for their lives. The\r\nwretched SIBO now endeavoured by penances, prayers, donations to the\r\nchurches, monasteries, and convents, as well as distributions among the\r\npoor, to propitiate the powers above, and regain his only child. Heaven\r\nseemed hardened against him, and the gnomes of Kedrick retained their\r\ncaptive. The only consolation of the father was, that Garlinda was seen\r\nat sunrise and sunset, looking from her airy prison down to the valley\r\nof Lorch. Days, months, and years rolled on, without any prospect of\r\nregaining his lost treasure. Meantime, every care was taken of Garlinda’s\r\nhealth and comfort by the fairies of the rock—and especially by an aged\r\nfemale gnome, who watched her assiduously, and occasionally gave her\r\nhopes of deliverance from captivity.\r\n\r\nFour years had now elapsed, and SIBO gave up all expectation of\r\nrecovering his daughter; when RUTHELM, a brave young knight, who had\r\ndistinguished himself in the wars against the Infidels, returned to the\r\nplace of his nativity, near Lorch. On learning the fate of Garlinda,\r\nhe determined to effect her rescue, or sacrifice his life. Her father\r\npromised the hand of the lady to her deliverer. Ruthelm reconnoitred,\r\nwith anxious eye, every side of the rocky mountain; but no part offered\r\nthe least prospect of escalade. It rose like a rugged wall in every\r\ndirection! Returning to his chateau in pensive meditation, he met a\r\ndiminutive dwarf on the road, who accosted him, and asked him if he had\r\nheard the story of Garlinda’s captivity on the summit of Kedrick? On\r\nreplying in the affirmative, the dwarf hinted that he could effect her\r\nfreedom if Ruthelm promised to marry her. The lover eagerly closed with\r\nthe proposal, and the dwarf vanished from his sight.\r\n\r\nThe youthful knight began to fear that the promise of the dwarf was a\r\ndeception, when an aged female gnome stood before him, and presenting him\r\nwith a small bell, desired him to repair to the valley of Wesperthal, a\r\ngloomy and haunted ravine behind the Kedrick, and there seek the entrance\r\nof a deserted mine, which he would recognize by two old pine trees that\r\ngrew at its mouth. When he had descended a few steps into the mine, he\r\nwas to ring the bell thrice, and abide the result. Ruthelm was punctual\r\nto the directions, and found the place. As soon as the bell was rung,\r\na light was seen rising from the bottom of the mine, and presently a\r\ndwarf appeared, and demanded what Ruthelm wanted. He related the promise\r\nof the female dwarf, and her injunction to ring the bell which she had\r\ngiven him. The dwarf examined the bell. The inhabitant of the mine\r\ncommanded Ruthelm to be at the foot of the mountain before the dawn of\r\nnext morning. Then drawing a small trumpet from his girdle, he sounded\r\nit thrice, when instantly the ravine and the whole valley swarmed with\r\ngnomes carrying ropes, hatchets, saws, and hammers. In a few minutes\r\ntrees were heard falling down the sides of the ravine, felled by the axes\r\nof the gnomes, while hundreds of these nimble gentry were busily employed\r\nin forming the wood into the different parts of the ladder.\r\n\r\nRuthelm slept little that night, and was at his post before the dawn of\r\nmorn. He found the ladder placed against the perpendicular precipice, and\r\nreaching to its highest pinnacle. He began to mount the ladder; but the\r\nterrific vibrations and oscillations of the slender machine, required all\r\nthe courage of a hero, and all the devotion of a lover—\r\n\r\n                  ——lest the deficient sight\r\n    Topple down headlong.——\r\n\r\nAt length he reached the summit of the rock, and was rewarded for his\r\nhazard, by the sight of Garlinda reclining asleep in a bower of roses and\r\neglantine. Her beauty surpassed all that had been reported, even by her\r\nown friends. While gazing on the sleeping nymph, she awoke, and Ruthelm\r\ndropped on his knee. At that instant the little old man, who had carried\r\noff Garlinda, stood before them, and, with frowning looks, demanded the\r\nname of the intruder, the cause of his visit, and the means by which\r\nhe had ascended the mountain? Ruthelm firmly replied, that he came to\r\ndeliver Garlinda from her prison, and restore her to an affectionate, but\r\nbroken-hearted parent—that the means of his access would be explained\r\nby the bell, which he held in his hand. Garlinda, at these words, burst\r\ninto a flood of tears, and entreated the dwarf to allow her to visit\r\nher father. The dwarf paused for a moment, and then replied:—“Your\r\nfather, Garlinda, has been amply punished for his inhospitality, and you\r\ndeserve reward for your patience and resignation. For you, Sir Knight,\r\n(addressing Ruthelm,) the jewel you seek is not yet purchased, even\r\nby the perils you have encountered. A more dangerous task remains—the\r\ndescent from this mountain. You must return by the ladder; I will conduct\r\nGarlinda by a secret path to her father’s mansion.”\r\n\r\nRuthelm, in descending the ladder, found infinitely more difficulty than\r\nin his ascent: and several times his head turned giddy, and he was nearly\r\nprecipitated to the bottom of the ravine. When he reached Sibo’s castle,\r\nhe found the daughter in the arms of her father, who was weeping for joy.\r\nSIBO, from that moment, kept his gate open to every object of distress—a\r\npractice which was continued by Ruthelm and Garlinda, during a long\r\nseries of years.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORAL.\r\n\r\nTo counterpoise the baser passions and propensities of our nature,\r\nthe Omniscient Creator has implanted others in the human breast of an\r\nennobling kind. Thus charity and benevolence antagonise selfishness and\r\navarice. But these passions and propensities, good and bad, are not left\r\nto contend with each other in anarchy, like jarring elements. Over them\r\nis placed a power without passion, an emanation from the Deity, designed\r\nto control the vicious and foster the virtuous workings of the spirit,\r\neither by direct influence, or, which is more common, by nullifying the\r\nbad by the good propensities.\r\n\r\nIt is this God-like REASON, which distinguishes MAN from the BRUTE\r\ncreation. The latter have but one governing passion or INSTINCT, each,\r\nfrom which they cannot deviate, and which never fails to lead them to\r\ntheir proper objects. But even in MAN, and especially in uncultivated\r\nstates of mind, REASON is too often unequal to the governance of\r\nthe unruly passions, and requires the aid of another and higher\r\npower—RELIGION.\r\n\r\nReason may, and too often does, err; but instinct is as undeviating\r\nin its course as the earth in its revolutions round the sun. Whenever\r\nthe voice of Reason and the dictates of Religion are resisted, and\r\nultimately disregarded, some prominent passion from the vicious side of\r\nhuman nature is sure to gain and to retain the mastery. The consequences\r\nneed not be told! Every day that vice retains possession of the soul,\r\ndiminishes the chance of virtue regaining the ascendancy:—Hence the evil\r\nof procrastination in the work of reformation!\r\n\r\nBut to return. Hospitality to the stranger, and charity to the indigent\r\nare virtues so universally acknowledged, that few are bold enough to\r\ndeny them in theory, though there are many SIBOS who are chary of the\r\npractice. The sums which were lavished on monasteries and convents, in\r\nuseless remorse, would have saved the Chieftain of Lorch many a bitter\r\nhour of reflection, had they been judiciously applied to the relief of\r\npenury and misfortune, before he was made to taste the bitter cup of\r\nanguish himself!\r\n\r\nThe other part of the legend illustrates the well-known fact that—\r\n\r\n    “Love will hope where Reason would despair.”\r\n\r\nAnd not only hope, but accomplish things apparently impossible of\r\nachievement. Ruthelm was not the only one who has fallen in love\r\nof unseen objects, and only known through pictorial or descriptive\r\nrepresentations. Few have passed the juvenile period of life without\r\nhaving some imaginary goddess or hero in their thoughts, endowed with all\r\nthe virtues and charms which—\r\n\r\n    “Youthful poets fancy when they love.”\r\n\r\nWhether time and experience have always _realized_ (as Jonathan would\r\nsay) these golden dreams, can only be determined by the knowledge of each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLeaving Lorch, then, on our left, (in ascending the river) our attention\r\nis strongly attracted to a renovated chateau on our right—RHEINSTEIN.\r\nHere we must halt for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRIDAL OF RHEINSTEIN; OR, THE RUNAWAY MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Tenth._)\r\n\r\nAbout midway between Lorch and Bingen, on our right hand, stands the\r\nrenovated castle of Rheinstein, on a romantic eminence, and very near\r\nthe Rhine. It is no longer a desolate pile of ruins, but the habitation\r\nof a royal prince of Prussia, whose proud banner floats on its lofty\r\nturret. No destructive missile or drawn sword now repels the inquisitive\r\nstranger. The draw-bridge falls at the approach of Jew or Gentile, rich\r\nor poor—and the renovated halls are thrown open to the inspection of all\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nTradition informs us that the original castle was inhabited by a\r\nBaron Sifred, a dissolute young robber, who carried off from France,\r\na beautiful maiden, and detained her in durance vile within his\r\nimpregnable fortress. The captivity of the lady, however, made a\r\nwonderful revolution in the baron’s life. The noise of revelry and arms\r\nwas superseded by the sounds of the lute—and YUTTA became the bride of\r\nSIFRED. Twelve months of love and happiness flew rapidly round, and Yutta\r\npresented her husband with a pledge of their affection—a female child.\r\nThe mother survived the birth only a few hours. The baron shut himself up\r\nin his castle, and dedicated his time to the education of his daughter.\r\n\r\nGuerda grew up to the delight of her father’s declining years—and to the\r\nrelief of wandering pilgrims, who sought refuge in the castle, and who\r\nsounded the fame of Guerda’s beauty far and near.\r\n\r\nHosts of suitors now flocked to the castle, but they were referred by\r\nSifred to an approaching tournament at Mayence, where his daughter would\r\nselect the most valiant knight. Her appearance at the assemblage excited\r\nuniversal admiration; and two knights determined to win her hand—Kuno\r\nof Reichenstein, and Conrad of Ehrenfels. The latter was the elder,\r\nand of a fierce disposition—the former was evidently preferred by the\r\nlady. Notwithstanding prodigies of valour, Kuno was defeated, and Conrad\r\nclaimed the hand of Guerda. The father received the victor as his future\r\nson-in-law; while the dejected Kuno prepared to join an expedition to\r\nPalestine. The hapless Guerda was overwhelmed with grief; but her father\r\nwas inexorable! The day of the nuptials was fixed—the cavalcade, with\r\nGuerda, the pallid victim of parental tyranny, mounted on a milk-white\r\nsteed, proceeded towards the chapel, which was midway between the castle\r\nof her father and that of Kuno of Reichenstein. When near the sacred\r\nedifice, Guerda’s horse suddenly reared and plunged, endangering the life\r\nof the bride. Conrad, while endeavouring to seize the reins, received\r\na dreadful kick from the furious steed, which prostrated him on the\r\nground. The animal immediately darted forward, like an arrow from a bow,\r\nand never stopped till he carried the betrothed to the very gate of\r\nKuno’s castle. Her lover, who witnessed this exciting scene, flew to the\r\ngate—gave admittance to Guerda—dropped the portcullis—and secured the\r\ntreasure! Conrad was killed by the blow from the steed, and Sifred soon\r\nafterwards gave consent to the nuptials of Kuno and Guerda.\r\n\r\nWould that, in every mercenary and ill-assorted match, the bride were\r\nmounted on so spirited and sensible a palfrey as that of Guerda, when\r\nproceeding to the altar! The _runaway_ marriage of Rheinstein was far\r\npreferable to many of those slow and stately processions which attend the\r\ncontracts of fashionable modern life!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAT OR MOUSE-TOWER.\r\n\r\n(_Legend the Eleventh._)\r\n\r\nIt appears that there were corn-laws, or at least corn-monopolists,\r\nin days of yore as well as now. A dignitary of the church (not _our_\r\nchurch), the bishop of Mentz, had well-stored granaries, and fared\r\nsumptuously. A time of scarcity arrived. The populace begged for bread;\r\nbut the bishop would only give them blessings. These would not fill the\r\nstomach, and the clamour becoming louder, the bishop waxed wroth. He\r\nflung open one of his granaries containing but little grain. The people\r\nrushed in—he bolted the doors—and set fire to the building! Murder will\r\nbe out, sooner or later, and even punished in this world. The rats and\r\nthe mice took up the cause of their masters. They cut through the floors\r\nand ceilings of the palace—nibbled holes in the arras—and poked their\r\nlittle noses through to smell the fat bishop. This was notice to quit, or\r\nfurnish a cannibal supper for the unwelcome intruders.\r\n\r\n      “They gnawed the arras above and beneath,\r\n    They ate each savoury dish up.\r\n      And shortly their sacrilegious teeth\r\n    Began to nibble the bishop!”\r\n\r\nThe holy man betook himself to a tower in the middle of the Rhine; (Tours\r\ndes Rats) but the nimble little quadrupeds swam across in legions—scaled\r\nthe tower—and devoured the bishop!\r\n\r\n    One morning his skeleton there was seen,\r\n      By a load of flesh the lighter,\r\n    They had picked his bones uncommonly clean,\r\n      And eaten his very mitre!\r\n\r\nThe moral is good, though the tale is improbable. But if the AUTO DA FÉ\r\nof the bishop was a romance, the atrocity of the action has too often\r\nbeen surpassed even in our time—and that by “butcherly blockheads” in the\r\ncause of bigotry and superstition, though in the name of religion!\r\n\r\nI suspect that the moral of the “Mouse or Rat Tower” lies much deeper\r\nthan is supposed. It seems to indicate that, although the rich and the\r\npowerful may sometimes evade the law, they can never escape punishment.\r\nThe inward monitor cannot be stifled, cross what rivers, seas, or\r\nmountains we may—\r\n\r\n    “Cœlum non animum mutant\r\n              qui trans mare currunt.”\r\n\r\nwhich I would liberally translate thus:—\r\n\r\n    O’er sea and land the guilty flies,\r\n      To blunt the stings of conscience keen;\r\n    Vain hope! That “worm that never dies,”\r\n      Preys on his vitals all unseen!\r\n\r\nThe mice were meant to represent the conscience of the cruel bishop, from\r\nwhich, neither the streams of the Rhine nor the battlements of the tower\r\ncould protect him.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF SCENE.\r\n\r\nAfter passing BINGEN, the poetry of the Rhine disappears—or sinks into\r\nsmooth but unimpassioned prose. The “castled crags” and precipitous\r\ncliffs soften down into sloping glades and country villas—the river\r\nwidens, and becomes studded with innumerable islets, verdant to the\r\nwater’s edge—the majestic and romantic features of the scenery are\r\nchanged into the beautiful and the fertile—it is like turning from the\r\nstatues of Mars and Bellona to those of Cupid and Psyche! The legends\r\nand tales vanish with the rocks and ruins where they had a “local\r\nhabitation”—romance degenerates into reality—the fervid imagination\r\nis softened down into sober judgment—and the excitement of admiration\r\nsubsides into the tranquillity of reflection! The eye is spoiled for the\r\ncharms of the wide-spread Rhinegau, teeming with the grape, and with\r\nevery necessary of life; yet the landscape is loveliness itself. What it\r\nhas lost in sublimity, it has fully gained in beauty.\r\n\r\nThe sun had just set beneath the horizon, and while—\r\n\r\n    “Twilight’s soft shades stole o’er the village green,\r\n    With magic tints to harmonize the scene,”\r\n\r\nour contemplations were broken by the steamer suddenly sheering alongside\r\nthe jetty at Biberich, and discharging its cargo of human beings close\r\nto the royal palace of Nassau. After the usual bustle attendant on the\r\ntransmigration of souls, bodies, and baggage, from water to land, we were\r\nsafely deposited, in less than an hour, at the Adler Hotel, within a\r\nstone’s throw of the celebrated KOCHBRUNNEN, or chicken-broth distillery\r\nat Wisbaden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWISBADEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most celebrated spas in Germany—and more frequented,\r\nas a _medicinal spa_, than any other by our countrymen and women. It\r\nis only four miles from Biberich, near Mayence, and is very pleasantly\r\nsituated, with a ridge of the Taunus to the north-east, while the country\r\nis open between it and the Rhine, in the opposite quarter. It is a very\r\nhandsome town, of seven or eight thousand souls, and the capital of the\r\nduchy of Nassau. It is, itself, in a slight depression of the ground,\r\nbut not so much as to impede a free circulation of air. Wisbaden is\r\nhealthy, though rather warm, owing, probably, to the hot springs under\r\nthe surface. The temperature, however, renders it a good winter residence\r\nfor those who are unable or disinclined to seek the shores of Italy or\r\nother southern localities. The neighbouring country produces all the\r\nnecessaries of life in abundance, and the vicinity of Frankfort, Mayence,\r\nand the Rhine, secures it the luxuries, when required. Excellent water\r\nis conducted from the Taunus for the use of the town. The CURSAAL is the\r\nmost magnificent in Europe—the hotels are numerous and good—the walks and\r\nrides exceedingly varied, cheerful, and salubrious. There are from ten\r\nto fifteen thousand annual spa-drinkers and bathers—while a far greater\r\nnumber spend a short time at Wisbaden for pleasure. A considerable number\r\nof the hotels have bathing establishments—the Eagle is the oldest—and\r\nis well appointed. In turning up from this hotel towards the Cursaal,\r\nwe stumble on the KOCHBRUNNEN, (the scalding spring,) the grand source\r\nof the drinking waters, and also of several baths. It has rather a mean\r\nappearance, and the water looks rather of a greenish-yellow colour, and\r\nseems turbid in the well, with a scum over a part of it, which is called\r\n“_cream_,” and is considered by the chemists as a peculiar animal or\r\nextractive matter, whose nature and source are unknown. The taste is that\r\nof weak chicken-broth with rather too much salt. There are upwards of\r\nnine hundred baths in the different establishments.\r\n\r\nThe plantations, extending from the back of the Cursaal to the old ruin\r\nof Sonnenburg Castle, are very beautiful—and thence are paths cut among\r\nthe umbrageous woods to the PLATTE, the Duke’s Summer-house, on one of\r\nthe mountains of Taunus, whence a magnificent view is obtained—Rhineward\r\nand Inland.\r\n\r\nThe road to Schwalbach and Schlangenbad present fine airy drives and\r\nwalks over high, open, and unwooded grounds, communicating health and\r\nvigour to the enfeebled frame.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, the Romans were well acquainted with Wisbaden, and\r\nclose to the Kochbrunnen, in the Romerbad, may be still seen the remains\r\nof several Roman baths—and one in particular having two springs of its\r\nown. But the monuments of antiquity in this place are numerous.\r\n\r\nThree grand theories respecting the causes and sources of thermal springs\r\ndivide the transcendental philosophers, naturalists, and physicians of\r\nGermany. These are the electro-chemical—the volcanic—and the vital.\r\nWURZER expresses the opinions of the first class thus:—“As Nature is\r\nperforming her operations in her immense laboratory, she has here a\r\n_galvanic apparatus_ of immense size. Extensive masses of mountains,\r\n_perhaps_ of unfathomable depth, _probably_ form the individual plates of\r\nthis voltaic column.” This is tolerably bold. While Brand and Faraday are\r\ndissolving metals by the tiny galvanic apparatus in Albemarle Street,\r\nNature is manufacturing mineral waters at Wisbaden, Ems, and Carlsbad,\r\non a magnificent scale! Lichtenberg, however, surpasses Wurzer in the\r\nsublimity of his ideas on this subject.\r\n\r\n“In the distilling operations of Nature, the belly of her retort\r\nsometimes lies in Africa—its neck extending all over Europe—whilst its\r\nrecipient is in—Siberia.”!!\r\n\r\nBischoff, Struve, Kastner, and others, are more moderate in their\r\nflights. They ascribe the origin of some thermal springs to volcanic\r\noperations in the bowels of the earth—of other springs to the gradual\r\nsolution of their component parts in subterranean reservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe third class of philosophers have boldly cut the Gordian knot, instead\r\nof untying it, and erected thermal springs and mineral waters generally\r\ninto _animated beings_ which transfuse their vitality into the bodies of\r\nthe spa-drinkers, and thus cure all diseases!\r\n\r\n“These and similar observations (says Dr. Peez, of Wisbaden,) compel\r\nus to admit the existence of a _peculiar vital principle in mineral\r\nwaters, communicating to the human body either an attractive faculty more\r\nconsonant with the medicinal component parts of the water; or, acting by\r\nitself as a healing power upon the diseased organism_.”[12]\r\n\r\nThe _italics_ are those of Dr. Peez, and not mine. German mysticism could\r\nhardly be expected to go farther. But it has outdone itself, as the\r\nfollowing extract will shew:—\r\n\r\n“The partial effect of the medicinal component parts of mineral waters\r\nis pushed back, as it were, retreating under the ægis of a general power\r\nwhich directly excites the autocracy of the animated animal body, and\r\n_compels it to act according to the particular quality of the mineral\r\nspring determined by its component parts_.”—(104.)\r\n\r\nHere we have a good specimen of German ideality, and transcendental\r\nmystification![13]\r\n\r\nMy friend, Dr. Granville, like every other man of genius, has a hankering\r\nafter a theory; but he was too shrewd not to see that this monstrous\r\nGerman hypothesis of “vitality” would be too large even for the swallow\r\nof John Bull. He has therefore substituted a much more rational and\r\nintelligible reason for the effects of thermal spas—namely, their\r\n_caloricity_, as differing materially from that of common water heated\r\nto the same degree of temperature. It is very easy to conceive that\r\ncauldrons that have been kept boiling in the bowels of the earth for\r\nthousands of years, will have diffused the caloric more uniformly and\r\nminutely through the waters, and dissolved more completely the mineral\r\ningredients, than pots and kettles in the laboratory of the chemist.\r\nThis, in all probability, is the solution of the mystery respecting the\r\nsuperior efficacy of thermal spas.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the Kochbrunnen is as follows:—Forty-four grains of\r\ncommon salt—five of muriate of lime—one and a half of carbonate of lime,\r\nout of fifty-nine grains in the pint. The remaining nine grains are not\r\nworth enumerating, as the salt and lime are clearly the main ingredients.\r\nThere are only seven cubic inches of carbonic acid gas in the pint. The\r\ntemperature is little short of 160° of Fahrenheit. Let us begin with\r\nthe baths. At a temperature of 86° to 90°, the bath generally occasions\r\na slight sensation of chilliness, which goes off in a few minutes, and\r\nis succeeded by a feeling of comfort—serenity of mind—and ultimately a\r\ndegree of weariness or lassitude, inclining the bather to lie quiet and\r\nrepose himself. The volume of the body rather diminishes than expands,\r\nand the skin of the hands and feet are gently corrugated—the pulse\r\nbecomes slower and softer—irritability is lessened—spasmodic feelings (if\r\nthey existed,) disappear under the soothing influence of the waters on\r\nthe nervous system and circulation—the functions of the intestinal tube\r\nare encreased, as are those of the skin, kidneys, and various glandular\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nAt a temperature of 94° to 98°, the bather, at the moment of immersion,\r\nexperiences an agreeable sense of warmth—the vital powers are exalted,\r\nand all the functions of the organs are put into a state of increased\r\nactivity. The pulse expands and quickens, but is still soft—and all the\r\nsecretions and excretions are augmented after leaving the bath.\r\n\r\nAs the weight of the body is increased from half-a-pound to a pound\r\nand a half, while immersed, there can be no doubt that a considerable\r\nabsorption takes place. At above 98°, or blood heat, the bath\r\nexcites the pulse and renders it both full and hard—embarrasses the\r\nbreath—flushes the face—reddens the whole surface of the body—excites\r\nperspiration—powerfully draws the circulation to the skin—and not seldom\r\ncauses head-aches, vertigo—and even apoplexy. Douches and shower-baths\r\nare often ordered before the plunging or vapour-bath. Lavements of the\r\nspa-water are also employed—and it is said with good effects, relieving\r\nthe stomach from the ingurgitation of so much fluid.\r\n\r\nPreceding, and sometimes during the cure, the following phenomena occur\r\nin a majority of cases, in addition to those already described:—viz.\r\na prostration of strength—headaches—giddiness—constriction\r\nover the eyes—drowsiness. In some cases, there will be\r\nconstipation—loaded tongue—loss of appetite—oppression about the\r\nchest—feebleness of the limbs—nervous irritability—disturbed\r\nsleep—perspiration—palpitations—eruptions on the skin. These symptoms\r\nare acknowledged by the spa-practitioners themselves to indicate an\r\ninconvenient use either of the baths or the drink—or some abnormal\r\nsusceptibility of the constitution—or some impropriety of regime.\r\nThey soon disappear by lessening the application of the remedy, and\r\ntaking some aperient medicine—an omission, however, which most of the\r\nspa-doctors are sure to make, trusting, as they do, almost entirely to\r\nthe operation of the waters.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to remark that, the rheumatic and gouty who resort to\r\nthese waters, (and they are by far the most numerous classes,) must\r\nexpect to suffer a considerable increase of their complaints at the\r\ncommencement—amounting often to acute pain and even inflammation of the\r\nparts affected. The local medical authorities represent these as the sure\r\nprecursors of great relief, if not a radical cure of the maladies in\r\nquestion. I would advise patients to be on their guard in this respect.\r\nThe first two individuals whom I fell in with at Wisbaden, and whom I\r\nformerly attended, were in imminent danger of their lives, from the\r\neffects of drinking and bathing in the waters. One was on the verge of\r\napoplexy—and the other in a fair way for a rheumatic fever. Both were\r\nsoon relieved by aperients, colchicum, and starvation.[14]\r\n\r\nThere is another class who experience no uncomfortable symptoms during\r\nthe use of the waters, which operate by the skin, the kidneys, and the\r\nbowels—and these proceed quickly and favourably to a restoration of\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThere is still a third class who experience no relief from the waters,\r\nbut rather an exasperation of all their maladies. The spa doctors give\r\nthem this consolation, that, long after their return to their homes, they\r\nwill probably get much better—or quite well! The following passage from\r\nDr. Peez, should awaken precaution.\r\n\r\n“Let us now take into consideration a phenomenon we observe first after\r\npatients have for some time been drinking, or bathing in, the thermal\r\nwater of Wisbaden, and which might alarm timorous minds. The reaction\r\ntaking place in the beginning of the patient’s making use of the water,\r\nmentioned above, returns with _some individuals_. I have observed this\r\nbeing the case particularly with females of a hysteric disposition,\r\nattended with a _tendency_ to hemorrhoïdal complaints, who, for that\r\nreason, were very irritable. Bathing in, and drinking thermal water\r\nof this place for a fortnight, three weeks, and longer, are extremely\r\nfavorable,—each day is attended with additional success: one ailment\r\nafter the other disappears; a pause then ensues, the irritability of\r\nthe body rises—the patient’s sleep grows restless; some complain of\r\npalpitating of the heart, oppression of the chest, and slight vertigo. In\r\nthis case it is necessary to cease bathing, at least for some days, and\r\nto observe what nature means by that excitation. This, however, commonly\r\nceases in the course of a few days, when the patient may again take the\r\nbath without hesitation, and with advantage, provided he be careful to\r\nfollow the direction of his physician. Others, however, in that case have\r\nattained to the limits of bathing, prescribed by nature, and if they\r\nobstinately transgress these laws, their career on the road to recovery\r\ntakes a retrograde turn. I have seen such improvident bathers, who,\r\nnot knowing the nature of these phenomena, continued bathing without\r\nconsulting their physician, were seized with spasms, spitting of blood,\r\nand other ailments.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by Dr. Richter, that as the greater number of patients at\r\nWisbaden are afflicted with gouty or rheumatic complaints, so they must\r\nexpect to experience the specific effects of the waters more sensibly\r\nthan other people. It is not uncommon therefore for these to suffer, at\r\nthe beginning of the course, very high states of excitement, pain, and\r\neven inflammation of the parts involved in the original malady. This\r\nmay be encouragement to perseverance; but it may also prove extremely\r\nhazardous. The following case from Dr. Peez, will exemplify this remark.\r\n\r\n“The abdomen of a lady aged 52 years, having been afflicted for a\r\nlong time with _plethora abdominalis_, began at last to swell and to\r\ngrow hard, her complexion being tinged with a greyish-yellow colour,\r\nwhilst her organs of digestion were impaired at the same time. She was\r\nparticularly alarmed by occasional palpitations of her heart, most\r\ncommonly troubling her at night, and obliging her to quit her bed. Having\r\nbathed in, and drunk, our thermal water, the palpitations grew more\r\nviolent, and rendered it necessary that a small quantity of blood should\r\nbe taken from her occasionally.”\r\n\r\nIn the third week of the course, she was seized with a copious\r\n_purgation_ of morbid secretions, when the palpitations vanished—the\r\nabdomen became soft—the complexion cleared—and she was soon well.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that this good lady laboured under congestion of the\r\nliver, jaundice, and loaded bowels. Nature rescued her from the heat of\r\nthe Kochbrunnen, by a process which ought to have been instituted three\r\nweeks before.\r\n\r\nI shall endeavour to shew in other places, that these crises, spa-fevers,\r\nbad-sturms, and re-actions, described by the foreign writers on the Spas,\r\nare often attributable to the want of combining some mild mercurial\r\nalterative and aperient with the use of the waters. Many cures are\r\nprevented or rendered ineffectual by the dread of mercury entertained by\r\nthe German physicians.\r\n\r\nThe following AUXILIO-PRESERVATIVE (if I may so term it), will be found\r\nof essential service every night before taking the morning waters.\r\n\r\n    ℞.

R. avers, “the waters and baths of Wisbaden are eminently\r\nbeneficial.” The baths, when assisted by the internal use of the waters,\r\nbring anomalous and latent gout into its proper place and form—into the\r\nextremities, thus relieving the interior.\r\n\r\n3. _Paralysis, general or local_—the sequence of apoplectic attacks,\r\nor the consequences of metastases of gout, rheumatism, or cutaneous\r\neruptions from the surface to the brain or spine—also those paralytic\r\naffections occasioned by the poisons of lead, arsenic, mercury, &c.\r\nor contusions or other injuries of the head and back. Dr. Richter\r\ncautiously observes that, during the use of the Wisbaden waters for the\r\nforegoing class of complaints, it will often be necessary to bleed, cup,\r\nor leech, as well as to take aperient medicines from time to time, under\r\nthe guidance of the medical attendant.\r\n\r\n4. _Scrofulous complaints_, of all kinds and degrees.\r\n\r\n5. _Rheumatism_, with its various consequences. Of course it is _chronic_\r\nrheumatism that is here meant, with enlargements of joints, contractions,\r\neffusions into the capsular ligaments, &c. which attend on and follow\r\nthat painful class of diseases.\r\n\r\n6. The _sequences of mercurial courses_ for various diseases, both in\r\nthis country and between the tropics.\r\n\r\n7. _Several pulmonary complaints_, occasioned by repressed gout,\r\nrheumatism or cutaneous eruptions.\r\n\r\n8. The Wisbaden waters (like many other mineral springs) are lauded as\r\nefficacious in certain complaints and defects of both sexes, which it is\r\nnot convenient or proper to notice in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-INDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nDr. Richter dedicates a chapter to those complaints which are not\r\nbenefited, but injured by the waters of Wisbaden.\r\n\r\n1. All _acute_ diseases—that is to say, diseases accompanied by fever or\r\ninflammation, are totally and entirely prohibited from these waters. But\r\nthis is not all. Wherever there is febrile action in the constitution, or\r\nlocal inflammation, however subacute, or even chronic, the use of thermal\r\nsprings, either as drink or baths—but especially the baths—is dangerous.\r\n“These waters, internal and external, will excite the circulation and\r\nnervous system (already too much exalted) into the most dangerous\r\nreactions, and lead to the most deplorable consequences.” P. 43.\r\n\r\nPhthisical affections, except in the earliest stage, and before any\r\nmaterial change has taken place in the lungs, preclude the idea of\r\nutility from these waters. Emaciation, from internal suppuration in any\r\norgan, and resembling phthisis, forbids the waters of Wisbaden. The\r\nsame may be said of cachectic habits, where the blood is broken down,\r\nand the solids wasted. Dropsy of the chest, abdomen, or skin will be\r\nprejudiced by these sources—and in short, all diseases connected with,\r\nor dependent on defect of vital energy; or, in other words, debility of\r\nconstitution generally. Catarrhal affections of kidneys and bladder—fluor\r\nalbus—severe derangement of the digestive organs, (grand derangement\r\ndes organs de la digestion)—chronic diarrhœa, &c. with emaciation, will\r\nderive no benefit but injury from these waters. All tendency to spitting\r\nof blood—all enlargements of the glandular abdominal organs with debility\r\nand wasting, prohibit the use of Wisbaden waters. The same holds good\r\nwith respect to stony concretions in the kidneys or bladder—biliary\r\nconcretions in the gall-bladder or ducts—scirrhous formations in any of\r\nthe organs of the interior, or exterior parts—all organic affections of\r\nthe heart or large vessels—epilepsy—catalepsy—St. Vitus’s dance—very\r\ninveterate forms of gout, with chalk-stones, paralytic lameness, and\r\nconsiderable debility. In some of these last cases, Dr. R. thinks that,\r\nwhen directed with skill and caution, the waters may afford some relief\r\nthough nothing like a cure. Sterility, with constitutional exhaustion and\r\ndebility, has little to hope from Wisbaden.\r\n\r\nThe reader will here perceive a long list of maladies which the Wisbaden\r\nwaters will not cure, but aggravate. It is very rare for a spa-doctor\r\nto offer any such list. Their springs are panaceas for all the ills to\r\nwhich flesh is heir. There is a passage in Dr. Peez’s work respecting\r\nthe baths which deserves attention. He remarks that there is a point of\r\n_saturation_ in the use of thermal waters, beyond which it is dangerous\r\nto proceed. But this point of saturation is difficult to ascertain. The\r\nfollowing is not very consolatory.\r\n\r\n“The temperature of the bath must be made to correspond as exactly as\r\npossible with their individuality. Baths that are but _one_ degree\r\ntoo warm or too cool, will very soon produce the point of saturation.\r\nNeither is it advisable that such a person should bathe daily, nor, in\r\nthe beginning, stay in the bath longer than 15-25 minutes: for his great\r\nirritability very easily provokes in the very beginning those excitations\r\nthat are the forerunners of critical secretions and accelerate the\r\nappearance of the symptoms of overbathing, and if the patient be not\r\nexposed to the danger of a violent artificial fever, the success of his\r\ncure is, at least, rendered very doubtful. He is, in this case, obliged\r\nto discontinue bathing so long that the time intended to have been spent\r\nin bathing passes, or must be prolonged considerably.” 161.\r\n\r\nIn many people this critical point of _saturation_ is announced by very\r\nrestless sleep, disturbed by dreams—or somnolency by day—tenderness\r\nof the eye to light—uneasiness, despondency, and anxiety, without any\r\nadequate cause—derangement of the digestion—loaded tongue. If these\r\nsymptoms be overlooked or disregarded, phenomena of more importance\r\npresent themselves, such as palpitations—difficulty of breathing—profuse\r\nsweats—nausea—and finally a fever. Dr. P. is very averse to any active\r\nremedies to reduce the fever of over-bathing, and especially bleeding or\r\npurging. He advises that nothing be done but to desist from bathing, and\r\nto take some cooling acidulous waters, as those of Selters or Fackingen.\r\n\r\nThe same author assures us that the Wisbaden waters are extremely easy of\r\ndigestion—that they improve the appetite—open the bowels, in a majority\r\nof cases—are eminently diuretic—but occasionally produce constipation.\r\nFrom all that I could observe myself, these waters have very little\r\naperient effect.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate the diseases for which the Wisbaden waters are renowned\r\nwould require a small volume—at least according to the testimony of\r\nPeez. In one word, they cure all diseases in general, and many others\r\nin particular!! On looking over the works of spa-doctors, we must come\r\nto one or other of the following conclusions, viz. there must either be\r\na universal conspiracy among the faculty of Europe against spas, and in\r\nfavour of their own monopoly of thinning the ranks of the population by\r\nphysic—or the world is deaf to the entreaties of the water-doctors, and\r\ndesire not to be cured—or, what is not quite impossible, the virtues\r\nof mineral waters are a little too much extolled by those who have the\r\nadministration of them. It is perhaps fortunate for the world that one or\r\nother of these prejudices or infatuations prevail—otherwise there would\r\nbe no bills of mortality—no doctors—no undertakers—in short, man would be\r\nimmortal even in this world!\r\n\r\nThere will still be a considerable number, however, of afflicted beings\r\nwho will not despise the blessings so freely and so cheaply offered by\r\nthe high priests of Hygeia.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty well known that a kind of monomania prevails among all\r\nclasses on the Continent respecting hæmorrhoids—a complaint almost as\r\nmuch dreaded by the English as it is courted by foreigners. By the people\r\nit is considered quite a god-send—the absence of it being a calamity,\r\nand its presence a talisman against every malady—by the physician,\r\nits sanative powers are represented as only inferior to the waters of\r\nWisbaden, Kissengen, or Carlsbad. By the physiologist and pathologist\r\nhæmorrhoids are calculated to bear the same relation to the constitution\r\nthat the safety-valve does to the steam-engine. Without the one, the\r\nboiler would burst—without the other the German would die. In a word, the\r\nGerman had rather live without his pipe, than without his piles!\r\n\r\nTo the deficiency, absence, or interruption of hæmorrhoids are attributed\r\nchiefly all those obstructions of the abdominal viscera which lead to\r\ndropsy and other fatal diseases. The waters of Wisbaden are represented\r\nas having the normal or salutary power of restraining piles, when\r\nin excess—encouraging them when languid—and reproducing them when\r\naccidentally arrested. HYPOCHONDRIASIS is one of the grand forms in which\r\nsuppressed hæmorrhoids harasses the patient for years, according to the\r\ncontinental pathology.\r\n\r\n“How often,” says Dr. Peez, “does it, however, happen, that an abdominal\r\ndisease exclusively confined to the nervous system, suddenly changes its\r\ncharacter, preferably affecting the bloodvessels, and thus is transformed\r\ninto an active hemorrhoïdal disorder!\r\n\r\n“I have had occasion to observe the case of a husbandman, who had been\r\nsuffering the torments of hypochondria for some years; he was emaciated\r\nand ill fed. His means did not allow him to attempt a radical cure,\r\nand he applied only from time to time for my assistance, when his\r\nsufferings were most painful. In spring 1821 he was suddenly seized with\r\npalpitations of the heart, and when these ceased, his pulse continued\r\nfor some months to be full and hard, as in the case of fever. Discerning\r\nthe character of his disorder, I made him come to Wisbaden. Here he took\r\nhalf-baths, drank the water in copious doses, and was cupped in his\r\nlegs several times. In twelve days the hemorrhoïds declared themselves\r\nin the usual shape and delivered him from his melancholy, anxiety, and\r\noppression of the stomach, which had tormented him so long.” 196.\r\n\r\nDr. Peez informs us that the sequences of tropical diseases are radically\r\ncured by the Wisbaden springs.\r\n\r\n“Among the consequences of these endemic diseases of the Indies we must\r\nreckon: tumefactions of the liver, and the spleen, which frequently are\r\nencomous, as well as other tumors in the cavity of the abdomen: swellings\r\nand obstructions of the intestinal glands (which frequently also are the\r\nproducts of malignant cutaneous diseases, peculiar to the torrid zone),\r\nobstinate jaundice, spasms of the stomach, accompanied with a vomiting of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n“The English and Dutch physicians have these many years been in the\r\nhabit of sending patients of this class to Carlsbad or Wisbaden, after\r\nthose of the former first had tried Cheltenham to no purpose; and these\r\ntwo springs produce, in the above mentioned diseases, an effect really\r\nwonderful.” 198.\r\n\r\nNow we were told by the more cautious and candid Dr. Richter, a page\r\nor two back, that “all enlargements of the glandular abdominal organs,\r\nwith debility,” were diseases not to be remedied by these waters. All\r\nthese morbid growths are attended and nourished by more or less of\r\nchronic inflammation, and in these cases the Wisbaden, or any other\r\nthermal baths, are more likely to do harm than good. The aperient waters\r\nof Kissengen or Pulna are far more efficacious and safe. Dr. P. has a\r\nchapter on the efficacy of these waters in “paralysis the consequence\r\nof apoplexy.” Now every physician knows that the cause of the paralysis\r\nsucceeding apoplexy is the clot of blood effused in the attack, and the\r\ndamage which the brain has received in the neighbourhood of that clot.\r\nNature, at length, absorbs the effused blood, or surrounds it with a sac,\r\nand then the adjacent brain gradually recovers its function, if within\r\nthe power of nature, and the motion of the paralyzed limb is regained\r\nin proportion. How this salutary process is to be accelerated by the\r\nbaths or waters of Wisbaden, I cannot imagine; but I can very easily\r\nconceive that these warm baths may readily interrupt the work of nature,\r\nand convert a paralysis into an apoplexy. Such conversions, in fact, do\r\noccur every year at the German thermal spas. He says, “paralysis arising\r\nfrom _plethora_ will be cured with more facility by means of the thermal\r\nwaters, than that which is caused by the accumulation of lymph in the\r\nbrain or the spinal marrow.” This doctrine may be true in one sense, but\r\nit is dangerous in another. Paralysis from plethora is undoubtedly more\r\nsusceptible of cure than dropsy of the brain or spine; but it must be a\r\nmost hazardous attempt to try the waters of Wisbaden for plethora of the\r\nbrain or spinal-marrow.\r\n\r\nOur author’s directions for using the waters appear unobjectionable, and\r\ntherefore I shall cull out some of his chief rules.\r\n\r\n1. The waters ought to be drunk fasting, and before the bath—using gentle\r\nexercise and cheerful conversation between each draught. The cup should\r\nnever be emptied at once, but sipped slowly. Some people may drink four\r\nhours after dinner, but in less quantities and at a lower temperature.\r\n\r\nIn gouty affections, and where the skin is torpid, the water should be\r\ndrunk as hot as possible—and even in bed, if necessary. Some find it\r\nbetter to drink it luke-warm, and mixed with a little milk. Half an hour\r\nafter finishing the waters, breakfast, (chocolate, coffee, or egg-milk,\r\nor broth with the yolk of an egg,) may be taken. “The less nourishment\r\nthat is taken between drinking and bathing the better.” Half an hour\r\nor an hour should elapse even after the lightest breakfast, before the\r\nbath. It is dangerous to bathe when heated or perspiring. “Persons taking\r\na whole bath, should immerse themselves into the water only by slow\r\ndegrees, up to the neck, having previously sponged the chest and abdomen\r\nwith the bath water.” If seized with headache or vertigo in the bath, it\r\nis too hot, and ought to be left immediately. Baths in which you perspire\r\nare too hot, spoil the appetite, weaken the patient, and put him out of\r\nhumour all day. “All baths, even those of common water—sometimes cause\r\na sensible congestion of blood in the head.” The head should then be\r\nsponged with cold water. Great care should be taken to avoid sleep in the\r\nbath—or even after a hot bath—but after a tepid bath it may be allowed.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is very beneficial to use friction, by means of a brush\r\nor sponge, whilst in the bath. The duration of the bath is a quarter of\r\nan hour to an hour and a half. People should always begin with the short\r\nperiod—and not too high a temperature. Where it is desirable to encourage\r\ngentle perspiration after the bath, the patient should go to bed.\r\n\r\nAs all sudden extremes are repugnant to nature, invalids, when travelling\r\ntowards watering-places, should begin to adopt the regimen and hours\r\nwhich they must follow at the spas. A few tepid baths of plain water are\r\nuseful preparations, and light cooling diet, should be employed for a\r\nweek or two before arriving at the spa.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch of the motives, hopes, and prospects which lead\r\ninvalids to spas—and their routine of life and enjoyments at those\r\nplaces, is drawn by a SPA DOCTOR of twenty years’ standing. It is nearly\r\nfree from the sins of commission—but not of _omission_. It is penned _en\r\ncouleur de rose_—and, like the speech of an advocate, it slurs over all\r\nfeatures of the case that might seem disadvantageous to the cause of the\r\nclient. I shall supply some deficiencies at the end.\r\n\r\n“It is owing, in a great measure, to the enlivening influence which a\r\ntemporary residence at some watering-place exercises on the mind of the\r\nvisitor, that the most successful results are obtained there, and which\r\nthe best endeavours of the regular physician can seldom effect at home.\r\n\r\n“Persons not labouring under serious disorders—such as men of business,\r\nwho purpose only to repose from the fatigues with which the performance\r\nof their official duties is attended, and to partake of the amusements\r\nafforded by bathing-places—the man of letters, who takes refuge in them\r\nfor relaxation from his serious studies;—the tender mother, resorting to\r\nthem to obtain relief for a beloved daughter—all these have disengaged\r\nthemselves, as much as possible, from the trammels of their professional\r\nand domestic occupations and relations, and enter this new world with\r\nrenovated spirits. The cheerful and gay life of a bathing-establishment\r\npresents to all of them charms with which they were entirely unacquainted\r\nbefore. Individuals of all ranks, gathering there from neighbouring\r\nparts and the most distant countries, united there within narrow\r\nconfines, mostly for one and the same purpose, meet for the first time\r\nin that motley assemblage, and also hail each other, perhaps, for the\r\nlast time, for a long series of years. This variety, this contact of\r\nindividuals, frequently distinguished by high rank and eminent talents\r\nand accomplishments, enhances the charms of indiscriminate social\r\nintercourse, and adds an additional value even to the patient’s solitary\r\nhours, as I have frequently experienced myself, by ushering in the dawn\r\nof a happier futurity.\r\n\r\n“The variety of interesting objects that present themselves to his\r\nview, attracts his attention, and occupies his eyes and imagination,\r\nand kindred spirits find many opportunities at watering-places to meet\r\nand to form familiar connexions. A common purpose, the same society,\r\nthe participation of the same amusements and pleasures, facilitate the\r\nformation of many interesting connexions. The opportunities of mutual\r\nintercourse are numerous: the social meetings are not hampered by the\r\ntrammels of ceremony, and we readily acknowledge and enjoy mental and\r\nsocial talents wherever we meet with them.\r\n\r\n“The patients meet early in the morning on the public walks and at the\r\nwells. There they interchange their wishes and hopes of recovery. Many\r\nare on the eve of returning health; and, encouraged by the improving\r\nstate of convalescents whom they daily see, or by the perception of\r\nencreasing strength, feel themselves elated with the pleasing hope of\r\nexperiencing in their own persons the successful results of bathing\r\nwhich they behold in others. New hopes awake in others that are still\r\ngroaning under the burden of severe and painful disorders, when they hear\r\nmany of their acquaintances bless the beneficent spring that has restored\r\nto them health and the means of enjoying life.\r\n\r\n“Here plans for the amusements of the day are discussed, appointments\r\nfor shorter or longer excursions made, according to the strength and\r\ninclination of each individual; and these excursions, this enjoyment of\r\nthe open air, contribute a great deal to heighten the salubrious efficacy\r\nof the wells. A cheerful mind exercises the most happy influence on\r\nthe body, and who could indulge his melancholy bent and remain a cool\r\nobserver amidst the charms of nature and in the society of persons that\r\nare endeavouring to enjoy them?\r\n\r\n“Now the patient takes the bath, and is happy to remain in the congenial\r\nfluid to which earth communicates her vital warmth; he feels himself\r\nstrained more closely to the bosom of our common mother, whilst he is\r\nsurrounded by the salubrious liquid, issuing from her womb, and joyfully\r\npresages the tendency of her mysterious powers.\r\n\r\n“After the bath the patient regularly indulges himself with a few hours\r\nof rest, which affords him additional enjoyment. He notes down what he\r\nhas seen and heard, reads, writes, or directs his steps to the colonnade\r\nof the _Cursaal_, (pump-room,) where a select band of performers on wind\r\ninstruments gives an additional zest to the charms of the morning hours,\r\nuntil the company meet in the dining-hall, where they sit down to a\r\ncomfortable dinner, seasoned by the sweet sounds of excellent music.\r\n\r\n“Happy would it be if temperance and a sensible conversation did always\r\ncharacterise these meals, and if all would be mindful, that the offended\r\nNaiad severely punishes all kinds of excess, by which the strict regimen\r\nshe requires, is profaned!\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon the plans formed in the morning are executed, each\r\npatient trying the strength he has regained;—and, in the evening, the\r\nlovers of dancing repair to Terpsichore’s temple; whilst others spend\r\nthe evening in one of the parties that are formed in every bathing\r\nestablishment. After the fatigues of the day, a balmy sleep, which is\r\ninterrupted no more by restlessness, improves the encreasing strength,\r\nand the dreams that formerly were the mirrors of a melancholy reality,\r\nare superseded by cheerful sports of fancy.\r\n\r\n“These are the general outlines of a life that may be led at a\r\nmuch-frequented watering-place, and by many is realized in a shape still\r\nmore pleasing and refined. The great diversity of enjoyments that may\r\nbe procured at these places, allots to each as much as he may want, and\r\nsometimes even more than many a one desires.”[15]\r\n\r\nBut is there no drawback on this scene of sunshine? Do all experience\r\nthe invigorating influence of returning health? No. Not one half! Do the\r\nhypochondriacs who resort to Wisbaden in shoals, throw off their load\r\nof mental despondency and bodily infirmities? Let Dr. Granville, who\r\nis not inclined to depreciate spas in general—and “SPAS OF GERMANY” in\r\nparticular, decide the question.\r\n\r\n“What a dreadful picture of human wretchedness the hypochondriac at\r\nWiesbaden presents! He is sombre, thoughtful, or absent, in the midst\r\nof a laughing world. For ever brooding over his fate, his disease\r\nabsorbs the whole of his attention. He disdains even the most trifling\r\nconversation with his fellow-creatures, and flies from those ephemeral\r\nacquaintances which are so easily formed at watering-places, exactly\r\nbecause one cares little how soon after they are forgotten. In fact, he\r\nwould feel himself alone in the world, and never concern himself about\r\nthose around him, did he not envy their healthy looks, their firmer\r\nmuscles, and their sounder stomachs, which can sustain an indigestion\r\nwith impunity!”\r\n\r\nThere are a great many others, besides hypochondriacs, who are destined\r\nto feel the melancholy effects of blighted hopes in these last resorts of\r\nsuffering—and who turn their weary steps homewards, without the cheering\r\nexpectations that gilded their journey to a foreign land!\r\n\r\nBut is there no risk of receiving, in exchange for dear-bought health, a\r\nmoral contagion that poisons the springs of life, and saps the foundation\r\nof every virtue? Beneath the gilded domes of that splendid mansion—that\r\npalace of Plutus—that CURSAAL, or _Curst Hell_—the dæmons of play exhibit\r\ntheir piles of glittering ore—those “irritamenta malorum—\r\n\r\n    “From night till morn, from morn till dewy eve,”\r\n\r\nfamiliarizing the uninitiated eye to scenes of desperate\r\nspeculation—imbuing the soul with the wicked thirst of gold unjustly\r\nacquired—of plunder, without fear of punishment—of robbery, without\r\ndanger of the gallows! The atmosphere of this Pandemonium—for the\r\ndevils are in legions here—is too infectious to be long resisted. The\r\nopen manner in which the vice is practised by day, and by night—in the\r\npresence of multitudes of all ages, nations, and both sexes—on the\r\nsabbath of the Lord, as well as on the day of work—this legalization,\r\nnot merely permission of a violation of morality, religion, and social\r\norder, which, in England, must skulk in holes and corners—the kind of\r\nsocial heroism with which the most destructive vicissitudes of fortune\r\nare borne by some of the hardened haunters of these splendid hells—these\r\nand various other circumstances combine to mask the hideous mien of the\r\nmonster, and strip the crime itself of half its horrors, till, by daily\r\npresentation, it becomes at length endurable without terror, and embraced\r\nwithout remorse! The neophyte has no sooner wound up his courage to the\r\nstaking of his piece of gold, than the spell of security is broken—the\r\ncharm of serenity is dissolved—the flood-gate of the passions is thrown\r\nopen—the “_auri sacra fames_” takes possession of the soul—and the dæmon\r\nof the night enrols one more name on the list of his victims!\r\n\r\nThe Spartan practice of exhibiting the drunken slave to disgust the\r\nrising generation with the vice of inebriety, was a doubtful experiment\r\nat best—but, in the present case, there can be no doubt at all as to its\r\ninapplicability. There is always seen a certain proportion of the fair\r\nsex round the gambling-tables—many of them playing with quite as much\r\ndesperation as the men. It is melancholy to state that, we too often see\r\ndelicate English females squeezing in between parded Jew and whiskered\r\nGerman, to stake their gold or silver on the gyrations of a ball or the\r\ncolour of a card!\r\n\r\nHere is an excellent NORMAL SCHOOL, where the wives, and daughters, and\r\nsons of our nobility and gentry can learn the rudiments—“_and something\r\nmore_”—of heartless vice and headlong dissipation, without reference\r\nto sectarian creed, theological faith, or national religion;—while the\r\nchildren of the Protestant peasant and mechanic would be contaminated by\r\nthe presence of Catholic or Dissenter in the same grammar-school, when\r\nacquiring the rudiments of reading and writing! If this be not “straining\r\nat gnats and swallowing camels,” I know not what is!\r\n\r\nAnd here I may glance at a curious species of one-sided morality strictly\r\nenforced by the late Duke of Nassau—the prohibition of gambling in the\r\n“CURST-HELLS,” among his own subjects; while free permission is given\r\nto all foreigners to rob and plunder each other at roulette and rouge\r\net noir, in the open day—Sundays and Saturdays! When I said _free_\r\npermission, I was wrong. The license to gamble is sold to the bankers\r\nof each Cursaal (curst hell) for a large sum—which goes into the ducal\r\ntreasury. I puzzled my brains, for a long time, in the attempt to\r\ndiscover the _principle_ of this law, and at length found it, as far off\r\nas China. The geographers of that country represent the Celestial Empire\r\nas occupying nearly the whole of the dry land of this globe—the various\r\nother countries of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, being located as\r\nsmall islands dotted in the ocean, and inhabited by BARBARIANS. Now it is\r\nclear that the late Duke considered his Duchy of Nassau as the Celestial\r\nEmpire of Europe, the other nations, as Russia, Prussia, Austria, Italy,\r\nSpain, England, America, &c. being mere barbarians, whose morals were not\r\nworth preserving—whose souls were not worth saving—and whose gold alone\r\nwas worth gathering into the royal exchequer at Biberich![16]\r\n\r\nThe young sovereign of Nassau has now a good opportunity of signalizing\r\nhis accession to power by abolishing the gambling tables of the Cursaals.\r\nThe income derived from the licensing of “hells” cannot yield good\r\ninterest here or hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADLER, OR EAGLE BATH.\r\n\r\nIt is not my custom to entertain my readers with the names of hotels,\r\nthe prices of wines, or the hours of table-d’hôtes. These pieces of\r\ninformation I leave for others. The present anecdote is an exception\r\nto the general rule. Having arrived late at Wisbaden, we put up at\r\nthe nearest hotel, which was the Adler, or Eagle, the one where Dr.\r\nGranville resided, and the locality of which is not considered the very\r\nbest by him. We found it a very good hotel, and well supplied with\r\nexcellent baths. Early next morning, my friend Mr. Cooper, of Brentford,\r\nand myself, took out our tickets from the “BADE-MAITRE” in the hall,\r\nand strolled round the establishment, without meeting with any person\r\nwhatever. As several of the baths were standing open, we went into the\r\nfirst two that struck our fancy, and bathed. I observed an unusual\r\nquantity of the scum or cream on the surface of mine, and which I could\r\nhave dispensed with. I took the opportunity, however, of examining this\r\ncream, by means of four out of the five senses, viz. by sight, touch,\r\ntaste, and smell. Before I left the bath I came to a conclusion as to\r\nits nature and origin. I have not a doubt that, at the great deluge, an\r\nimmense posse of white antediluvian bears, then as large as elephants,\r\nwere swept from the polar regions, and hurled headlong into the great\r\ncauldron beneath Wisbaden. There they have been simmering from the days\r\nof Noah—their flesh, fat, and marrow oozing up daily, in the shape of\r\ncream or bear’s grease, as well as broth, through the Kochbrunnen,\r\ngreatly to the advantage of the Wisbadenites, and the benefit of those\r\nafflicted with gout, rheumatism, and the stiff-joints of old age.[17] I\r\nam astonished that Dr. Granville and Sir Francis Head should have framed\r\nso puny an hypothesis as that of the KOCHBRUNNEN and CHICKEN-BROTH.\r\nWhy, I appeal to every one who has travelled in Germany, whether it\r\nwould be possible to extract an ounce of fat from all the cocks, hens,\r\nand chickens in Nassau, even if stewed in a Papin’s digester for six\r\nmonths together. No, no. The cream and broth of the Kochbrunnen are the\r\nveritable essence and decoction of the antediluvian bear, spiced perhaps\r\nwith a sprinkling of the “organic remains” of wolves, tigers, jackalls,\r\nhyenas, and other small gear.\r\n\r\nWhile I was dressing after my dip in this delectable soup, and carrying\r\nout the details of my theory, a series of heavy blows and unintelligible\r\nvociferations at the door, induced me to think that the hotel was on\r\nfire, or that the Kochbrunnen had exploded. I hastily drew the bolt,\r\nwhen in rushed the infuriated bath-master’s cad, with his Medusa-faced\r\ncadess, breathing forth all kinds of imprecations on my devoted head;\r\nand, from their gestures and actions, menacing me with a drowning instead\r\nof a plunging bath! I instantly threw myself into a posture of defence,\r\ndetermined, if I must drink the bear’s broth again, that the cad or his\r\ngentle mate should have the first gulp. On seeing this, they retreated a\r\nfew feet but still kept up a roar of abuse, till I had finished dressing,\r\nwhen my friend Cooper joined in the affray. The assailants followed us,\r\ntill I had nearly got to the bad-master’s office, where, opening one of\r\nDr. Granville’s volumes, which I had under my arm, I pointed out the\r\nnotice (not too favourable) which had been already taken of the Adler,\r\nand told him that I, too, was a SPA-TOURIST, and would render his baths\r\neither famous or infamous, by the portrait which I should draw of them,\r\nas a warning to my countrymen. The bath-master was astonished, and not a\r\nlittle terrified. He immediately summoned his cad and cadess, informing\r\nthem that the English gentleman was an AUTHOR, and threatened to publish\r\nin England an unfavourable account of the hotel and baths. The “_cream_”\r\nof the jest soon came out. It appeared that a dandy of sixty—a Cupid\r\nof the grand climacteric, had occupied for the season the bath which I\r\nused, taking care that the water should be turned in over night, in order\r\nthat the cream, or bear’s grease, should have time for concretion on\r\nthe surface, and thus “smoothe the wrinkled brow,” as well as lubricate\r\nthe unpliant joints, of this veteran Adonis. The denouement disarmed\r\nme of my wrath, especially when I recollected that, in this land of\r\nminute regulations, I ought not to have descended into a vacant bath,\r\nwithout the express sanction of the bad-master’s cad, in the subterranean\r\nregions. The hotel itself is a very excellent one, and its master,\r\nwho speaks English, a very civil and obliging host. I recommend it to\r\nmy countrymen, with this proviso, that they never go into a bath that\r\nhas an unusual proportion of bear’s grease on the surface, without the\r\ncad’s permission, lest they spoil the watery mirroir of some antiquated\r\nNarcissus, who hopes—vain hope!—by means of baths and broths, to relume\r\nthe lack-lustre eye—to efface the time-ploughed furrows from the faded\r\ncheek—to communicate elasticity to the indurated muscle—vital heat to\r\nthe stagnant veins—activity to the body, and energy to the mind:—and\r\nall these, _after_ the allotted hours of human existence have danced\r\ntheir giddy rounds[18]—after the cup of enjoyment has over-flowed, times\r\nwithout number, and is now drained to the dregs—_after_,\r\n\r\n    “The soul’s dark cottage battered and decayed,”\r\n\r\nhas begun to afford feeble shelter against the storms of moral adversity,\r\nand the stings of physical infirmity—_after_ the discovery of Solomon,\r\nthat “all is vanity,” has been amply verified! That humanity should\r\nstill cling fondly to the cheerful clay, _after_ all these warnings, is\r\nnot wonderful, because it is the natural impulse and instinct of every\r\nanimated being, from the gnat to the elephant. But that reasoning man,\r\nand woman too, should attempt, not merely to conceal the ravages of\r\ntime, but deck them out in the false colours of youth, is a mortifying\r\nreflection and preposterous exhibition! We see it however, every day—and\r\nthe Adonis of the Adler is an exquisite specimen.\r\n\r\nI shall close this Chapter with an extract from a little work on the Spas\r\nof Nassau, published in 1839, by my friend Mr. Lee, who practised three\r\nyears at Wisbaden, and made himself well acquainted with the remedial\r\nefficacy of these waters.\r\n\r\n“It is becoming evident in England, that the high reputation which\r\nthe Wisbaden springs have always enjoyed, for the cure and relief of\r\ngouty and rheumatic affections, has not been over estimated, from the\r\nnumbers who annually return home in an improved state, several of whom\r\nhaving for years been subject to repeated attacks of gout, have escaped\r\nany recurrence after a course of the baths, during the whole winter\r\nand spring, and have returned in subsequent seasons greatly improved\r\nin appearance, more for the purpose of more effectually preserving\r\nthemselves from a relapse, than from any actual necessity. In cases\r\nof long standing, of the atonic kind, with or without deposition of\r\ncalcareous matter in the joints, occurring in persons beyond the middle\r\nperiod of life, the Wisbaden baths are calculated to render the most\r\neminent service; indeed, according to Dr. Peez, the more inveterate the\r\ngout is, the more effectually can it be combated by these waters. Though\r\nbathing is the essential part of the treatment, it is advisable in most\r\nof these cases to combine with it the internal use of the water. Mild\r\ndouching will also tend very much to the dispersion of local swellings,\r\npuffiness, stiffness of the joints, of the wrist, fingers or foot, and\r\nalso of chalky concretions, _although it should not be used if there be a\r\ntendency to inflammatory action, nor until a certain number of baths have\r\nbeen taken_. During an attack, the baths will require to be suspended,\r\ntill the more severe symptoms have subsided; when the patient may again\r\nbegin, by previously drinking the water, while confined to his room. In\r\ngeneral, patients who have been accustomed to free living do not bear\r\na low regimen, and will be the better, after the inflammatory symptoms\r\nare allayed, for being allowed some solid food if an inclination be felt\r\nfor it; care being taken, that the quality be plain and light, and that\r\nthe quantity be small. In cases of erratic, irregular, or repelled gout,\r\nthese baths will also most probably be productive of great benefit,\r\nand not unfrequently cause the morbid action to restrict itself to one\r\nspot; a more regular attack being sometimes induced, previous to an\r\namelioration taking place. Persons who have only experienced two or\r\nthree attacks, but in whom the predisposition is strong, may generally\r\nexpect to derive permanent benefit from the baths; provided they are\r\nsubsequently cautious in their mode of living, and do not indulge too\r\nfreely in the pleasures of the table; on the other hand, where there\r\nis much tendency to acute inflammation, in persons of a plethoric or\r\nhighly irritable habit, I should consider Wisbaden less likely to suit\r\nthan a warm alkaline spring, as Vichy or Teplitz. I should be inclined\r\nalso to counsel many young persons, in whom the gout developed itself\r\nat an early age, in consequence of a strong hereditary tendence, to\r\ngive the preference to a spring of this kind; though it is probable\r\nthat they would equally derive advantage from Wisbaden. It cannot be\r\nexpected however, that a single course of the waters would suffice to\r\neradicate the disease; and, in order to have the chance of a permanent\r\ncure, persons afflicted with gout would do well to return, for two\r\nor three consecutive seasons, to the springs from which they derived\r\nbenefit; passing the intervening months in a suitable climate, and paying\r\nattention to the regulation of their diet and mode of living.\r\n\r\n“As the mornings are frequently chilly, and it is of importance to\r\nprevent the action of a cold atmosphere on the surface of the body, while\r\nunder a course of bathing, I do not in general recommend, to English\r\npatients, the very early hours of rising and drinking the water, adopted\r\nby the Germans; six, or half-past, will be sufficiently early, even for\r\nthose who take their bath before breakfast, and for those who do not,\r\nany time between that hour and half-past seven; breakfast being taken\r\nan hour after drinking, and consisting of tea or coffee, according as\r\nthe one or other is found best to agree. Those who dine at one o’clock,\r\nshould again drink about seven in the evening; while for those persons\r\nwho prefer dining at four, or later, from two to three will be the\r\nbest time for taking their second dose. The effects of the water are\r\nthus better sustained than when the whole quantity prescribed is taken\r\nin the morning, and an interval of four-and-twenty hours allowed to\r\nelapse between the periods of drinking; the water is often thus better\r\ndigested, and is well borne, when the distention of the stomach by the\r\nsame quantity if taken before breakfast, would disagree and give rise to\r\nunpleasant symptoms, or occasion a too active operation upon the bowels\r\nor kidneys.—It is also advisable, when a full course of these and other\r\nmineral waters is required, to recommend a temporary suspension of the\r\ncourse, and change of air for three or four days, after a certain period\r\nof drinking and bathing has elapsed; by this means, the system is not too\r\nearly saturated, and the patient returns to resume the use of the water,\r\nin a more fit state for its absorption, and with a greater probability of\r\nmore durable benefit.\r\n\r\n“Most chronic rheumatic affections will be removed or greatly relieved\r\nby the Wisbaden baths. In the slighter cases, not of long standing, a\r\nshort course, for about three weeks, will be frequently sufficient. In\r\nthe more intractable cases of articular and muscular rheumatism, as also\r\nin the pains of a rheumatic nature affecting the face, head, and other\r\nparts; a more prolonged course will often be required, combined with the\r\nuse of the douche. In some cases the hot bath, vapour-bath, or douche,\r\nmay be advantageously employed, especially in elderly persons whose\r\nskin is dry, and seldom perspirable. Where however the complaint has\r\nsupervened upon, or has been continued from an acute attack, in which any\r\nsymptoms of the heart or pericardium being affected, were present—which\r\nis more frequently the case than is generally supposed—it would be well\r\nto ascertain, by auscultation and percussion, that none of those symptoms\r\nremain, as they would very likely be aggravated by the employment of\r\nthe water. Those rheumatic affections depending upon long exposure to\r\nwet or cold, to which military men on duty are peculiarly subject, are\r\nespecially relieved by these baths. Two or three bad cases of this kind\r\nfell under my observation last year, in which the most beneficial and\r\nunexpected results followed a full course of the waters. One gentleman\r\nin particular who returned from India invalided, was scarcely able to\r\nget about with the assistance of a stick; who was sceptical of the\r\npower of mineral waters, and not over-attentive with respect to his\r\ndiet, recovered the comparatively free use of his limbs before he left\r\nWisbaden, and was completely restored when I met him about a month\r\nafterwards, in a steamer on the Mediterranean, being on his way to rejoin\r\nhis regiment.”\r\n\r\n“Those nervous pains recurring in paroxysms affecting the branches\r\nof particular nerves of the face, head, or extremities, to which the\r\nterm neuralgia or tic is generally applied, and which not unfrequently\r\noriginate from a rheumatic or gouty diathesis, from the suppression of\r\nhabitual discharges, or of cutaneous eruptions—which causes, though\r\nperhaps somewhat exaggerated by continental practitioners, are not\r\nsufficiently attended to in England—are more likely to be relieved\r\nand cured by a properly directed course of mineral waters, than by\r\npharmaceutical remedies or local applications. To many of these cases\r\nWisbaden would be exceedingly applicable, especially when the functions\r\nof the skin are sluggishly performed, and there exists a congested state\r\nof the abdominal or pelvic viscera, with retardation or irregularity\r\nof the periodical secretion in females. In those cases which appear to\r\narise from other causes, as moral influences, a high state of nervous\r\nexcitability, &c., I should be more inclined to recommend waters of a\r\ndifferent kind, of which I shall have to speak presently. Water or vapour\r\ndouches may in general be advantageously combined with the baths and the\r\ninternal use of the same water—or of a water of a different nature, as\r\nthat of Homburg, Marienbad, &c. according as circumstances may seem to\r\nindicate their employment.\r\n\r\n“The state of abdominal plethora, with congestion of the liver, and\r\nobstruction in the circulation of the vena portæ, termed by the Germans\r\n_Unterleibsvollblütigkeit_, with its consequences, as impaired digestion,\r\ndeficient or vitiated biliary secretion, piles, &c.—occurring for the\r\nmost part in persons about or beyond the middle period of life, who\r\nhave been addicted to the pleasures of the table, and marked by more or\r\nless protuberance of the abdomen, with diminished muscular and nervous\r\nenergy—is one well calculated to be relieved by the use of the Wisbaden\r\nwaters internally and externally employed. The baths, by exciting\r\nthe activity of the nervous and vascular systems, and by determining\r\npowerfully to the surface, tend most materially to equalize the\r\ncirculation and remove the internal congestion, while by the internal use\r\nof the water the secretions of the mucous membranes, of the alimentary\r\ncanal, of the liver and kidneys, are improved in quality, and often\r\nperceptibly increased in quantity;—at the same time that the mesenteric\r\nglands and absorbent vessels are stimulated to increased activity,\r\nand the digestion is consequently improved. Even when, under these\r\ncircumstances, the drinking of the water is not followed by immediate\r\nsensible effects, either upon the bowels or kidneys, it is frequently\r\nnot the less efficient on that account, and unless some inconvenience be\r\nexperienced, it should be persisted in, as after a certain time copious\r\ncritical evacuations will often occur, and be followed by immediate\r\nrelief; whereas were similar effects produced by artificial means, as the\r\nexhibition of drugs, the relief would only be temporary, and the frequent\r\nrepetition of the same or analogous measures, would be necessary, and\r\nwould tend but little to the permanent amelioration of the patient. In\r\nseveral of these cases, especially where there exists hardness or tension\r\nin the region of the liver, spleen, or in other parts of the abdomen, the\r\ndouche will be of material assistance in the treatment.”\r\n\r\n“In many cases of paralysis, baths of mineral waters offer the most\r\nefficient, and often the only means of arousing the nervous energy of\r\nthe system, and of the paralysed parts; and few have a more beneficial\r\ninfluence in this way than those of Wisbaden; but here again it cannot\r\nalways be determined beforehand, that baths of this kind will be more\r\neffectual than those of other springs containing but a small proportion\r\nof solid and gaseous substance, as the latter occasionally succeed after\r\nthe failure of the former. In the obscurity which still envelops the mode\r\nof action of mineral baths, this cannot be satisfactorily accounted for,\r\nexcept upon the principle of idiosyncrasy, or by the supposition that\r\nthe disturbing action of a thoroughly impregnated spring is less adapted\r\nto certain of these cases, than the more tranquilizing and sedative\r\ninfluence of a simple thermal, or slightly alkaline, warm spring. In most\r\ninstances, however, where there does not exist a high degree of nervous\r\nexcitability, or tendency to fulness in the cerebral vessels, the baths\r\nof Wisbaden may be used with great prospect of advantage; especially when\r\nthe complaint is of a rheumatic origin, depending upon the impression\r\nof poisonous influences upon the nervous system, as malaria, the abuse\r\nof mercury, or the employment of this and some other metals by workmen;\r\nas also in those cases, where the disease appears to be of a purely\r\nlocal nature, not connected with cerebral disease, but arising from\r\ndeficient energy of the nerves of the part, or of the spinal marrow,\r\nconsequent upon exposure to cold and wet, or other analogous causes.\r\nEven in paralysis affecting a limb or one side of the body, remaining\r\nafter an apoplectic seizure, baths of this and other mineral waters\r\nmay often be advantageously employed, provided there be no symptoms of\r\ncerebral congestion, or organic disease. Plethoric individuals, and those\r\nwhose digestive organs are disordered, will frequently require some\r\npreparatory treatment, previous to using the baths, in paralytic, as well\r\nas in other diseases. These, then, are the principal diseases which the\r\nWisbaden waters are more especially calculated to relieve, and in which\r\ntheir use in the form of baths and douches is the most essential part of\r\nthe treatment. There are besides various other complaints to which the\r\nexternal or internal use of the water, or both combined, is extremely\r\nsuitable, in common with several other mineral springs; but of which\r\nthe peculiar circumstances of each case require to be investigated, in\r\norder to enable the practitioner to decide upon the springs likely to be\r\nmost effectual. Of these, many scrofulous affections will be cured or\r\ngreatly ameliorated by the internal and external application of these\r\nwaters; particularly enlarged lymphatic glands of various parts, and of\r\nthe mesentery, occurring in children or young persons of a torpid habit,\r\nwith tumid upper lip and abdomen, a vitiated state of the intestinal\r\nsecretions, and a harsh dry condition of the skin. Here the exciting and\r\nresolvent powers of the waters are exceedingly effectual, by improving\r\nand augmenting the secretions of the alimentary canal, and of the skin;\r\nand, by stimulating the absorbent and vascular systems, mostly cause the\r\nspeedy diminution of glandular or bony swellings.\r\n\r\n“Another case, in which the Wisbaden springs are often eminently\r\nserviceable, is, where there is a general disordered state of the health,\r\nwithout the existence of any actual disease, or material derangement of\r\nany particular functions, except perhaps impaired digestive powers—as is\r\nvery frequently seen in Londoners, and inhabitants of other large cities,\r\nclosely engaged in trading, mercantile or professional occupations; as\r\nalso in those who have been resident in a tropical or unhealthy climate:\r\nsuch a state, though relieved and palliated for a time by medicines, not\r\nunfrequently terminates in serious functional or structural disease,\r\nif allowed to continue for a long period—and nothing would tend more\r\neffectually to its removal than temporary absence from the cares of\r\navocation, change of air and mode of life, and the employment of a\r\nmineral spring like Wisbaden, followed by that of a chalybeate water, in\r\nthose cases where it is not counterindicated.\r\n\r\n“The same may be said of several cases of hypochondriasis, with\r\ndisordered digestive powers, to which Wisbaden is applicable, both on\r\naccount of its waters, tending to rectify the deranged state of the\r\ndigestive organs, and also from the beneficial influence which would be\r\nexerted in most instances on the patient’s _morale_, by the movement of\r\nthe place, its cheerful appearance, the beauty of its environs, and the\r\nneighbourhood of so many objects of interest. To some patients of this\r\nclass, tepid bathing with the internal use of a cold gaseous spring is\r\nmost applicable. To others again, certain other mineral springs are best\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\n“The suppression or painful performance of periodical functions peculiar\r\nto females, is frequently benefitted by the Wisbaden baths; especially,\r\nif the cause be cold, checked perspiration, or a congested state of the\r\nabdominal or pelvic viscera. Some syphilitic affections, especially\r\nwhere much mercury has been employed, and certain chronic cutaneous\r\ndiseases, as psoriasis, impetigo, &c. where the skin is generally in\r\na dry state; as also eruptions of the face depending upon derangement\r\nof the alimentary canal or liver, will often be removed, by baths of a\r\nwarm saline water, like Wisbaden; and likewise by sulphurous or alkaline\r\nsprings, either alone, or combined with the internal use of the same, or\r\nsome other mineral water. In certain bronchial and laryngeal affections,\r\nwith cough, and scanty or deficient expectoration, the Wisbaden baths,\r\ncombined with the internal use of the water, and the inhalation of its\r\nvapour, may be expected to be of material advantage.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, these springs, like most others, will generally be\r\nprejudicial in organic disease of the lungs, heart, or large vessels, in\r\ndisorganisation of the abdominal or pelvic viscera, with fever, profuse\r\nhemorrhagy or discharges _per vaginam_, either depending upon relaxation\r\nor upon the presence of hypertrophy, polypus, or other structural\r\ndisease.”[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHLANGENBAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive cook-shop and laboratory under Wisbaden have communicated\r\nno small portion of caloric to the air, as well as to the waters of that\r\nplace. We no sooner begin to ascend the slopes or ridges of the Taunus\r\nthan we experience a remarkable transition from languor and oppression\r\nto vigor and elasticity—not confined to the _physique_, but extending\r\nalso to the _morale_. Of the two roads from Wisbaden to Schlangenbad, we\r\npreferred the mountainous, or inland route, to that along the Rhine, for\r\nthe sake of a bracing air and a boundless prospect. We trotted merrily\r\nalong the hills and vales of the Taunus, over a Macadamized road, till,\r\nin two hours, we found ourselves, all at once, in a romantic dell or\r\nvalley, bounded on both sides, by densely wooded mountains rising nearly\r\nperpendicular, from the narrow space between. In this small compass\r\nrise three or four huge buildings, white as snow, and each having more\r\nwindows than there are days in the year. I set them down as manufactories\r\nof cotton or cutlery, but the absence of all clanking of machinery or\r\nhissing of steam, soon undeceived me. On driving into a little square\r\nbetween the two principal Hoffs, all was silent as Pompeii—and not a\r\nhuman being was seen in any direction. There was no competition here\r\nbetween the two chief hotels—both belonging to one master—and he the\r\nsovereign of the country. As it was about 12 o’clock, all true Germans\r\nwere in their holes and corners, meditating on, and preparing for\r\nthe grand _business_ of the day—the onslaught of the _couteau_ and\r\n_fourçhette_ at the _mittag_ table-d’hôte. To the Serpent’s Bath, the\r\nintervening hour was dedicated. The cosmetic and renovating qualities\r\nof the Schlangenbad are nearly as far-famed now as the cauldron of\r\nMedea was, in days of yore. The Old Man of the Brunnens dipped his\r\npencil in prime copal _varnish_, when he _embellished_ the baths of\r\nthis sequestered valley. The description is a real bijou of its kind,—a\r\ndiamond of the first _water_—equally profitable to the pen of the painter\r\nand the purse of the royal proprietor!\r\n\r\n“The baths at Schlangenbad are the most harmless and delicious luxuries\r\nof the sort I have ever enjoyed; and I really quite looked forward to\r\nthe morning for the pleasure with which I paid my addresses to this\r\ndelightful element. The effect it produces on the skin is very singular;\r\nit is about as warm as milk, but infinitely softer: and after dipping\r\nthe hand into it, if the thumb be rubbed against the fingers, it is said\r\nby many to resemble satin. Nevertheless, whatever may be its sensation,\r\nwhen the reader reflects that people not only come to these baths from\r\nRussia, but that the water in stone bottles, merely as a cosmetic,\r\nis sent to St. Petersburg and other distant parts of Europe, he will\r\nadmit that it must be soft indeed to have gained for itself such an\r\nextraordinary degree of celebrity: for there is no town at Schlangenbad,\r\nnot even a village—nothing therefore but the real or fancied charm of\r\nthe water could attract people into a little sequestered valley, which\r\nin every sense of the word is out of sight of the civilised world; and\r\nyet I must say, that I never remember to have existed in a place which\r\npossessed such fascinating beauties; besides which, (to say nothing of\r\nbreathing pure dry air,) it is no small pleasure to live in a skin, which\r\nputs all people in good humour—at least with themselves. But besides the\r\ncosmetic charms of this water, it is declared to possess virtues of more\r\nsubstantial value: it is said to tranquillize the nerves, to soothe all\r\ninflammation; and from this latter property, the cures of consumption\r\nwhich are reported to have been effected, among human beings and cattle,\r\nmay have proceeded. Yet whatever _good_ effect the water may have upon\r\nthis insidious disorder, its first operation most certainly must be to\r\nneutralize the _bad_ effect of the climate, which to consumptive patients\r\nmust decidedly be a very severe trial, for delightful as it is to\r\npeople in robust health, yet the keenness of the mountain air, together\r\nwith the sudden alternations of temperature to which the valley of\r\nSchlangenbad is exposed, must, I think, be anything but a remedy for weak\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\n“The effect produced upon the skin, by lying about twenty minutes in the\r\nbath, I one day happened to overhear a short, fat Frenchman describe to\r\nhis friend in the following words—‘_Monsieur, dans ces bains on devient\r\nabsolument amoureux de soi-même!_’ I cannot exactly corroborate this\r\nGallic statement, yet I must admit that limbs, even old ones, gradually\r\ndo appear as if they were converted into white marble. The skin assumes\r\na sort of glittering, phosphoric brightness, resembling very much white\r\nobjects, which, having been thrown overboard, in calm weather within the\r\ntropics, many of my readers have probably watched sinking in the ocean,\r\nwhich seems to blanch and illuminate them as they descend. The effect is\r\nvery extraordinary, and I know not how to account for it, unless it be\r\nproduced by some prismatic refraction, caused by the peculiar particles\r\nwith which the fluid is impregnated.\r\n\r\n“The Schlangenbad water contains the muriates and carbonates of lime,\r\nsoda, and magnesia, with a slight excess of carbonic acid which holds the\r\ncarbonates in solution. The celebrated embellishment which it produces\r\non the skin is, in my opinion, a sort of corrosion, which removes tan,\r\nor any other artificial covering that the surface may have attained from\r\nexposure and ill-treatment by the sun and wind. In short, the body is\r\ncleaned by it, just as a kitchen-maid scours her copper saucepan; and the\r\neffect being evident, ladies modestly approach it from the most distant\r\nparts of Europe. I am by no means certain, however, that they receive any\r\npermanent benefit; indeed, on the contrary, I should think that their\r\nskins would eventually become, if anything, coarser, from the removal\r\nof a slight veil or covering, intended by nature as a protection to the\r\ncuticle.\r\n\r\n“But whether this water be permanently beneficial to ladies or not, the\r\nsoftness it gives to the whole body is quite delightful: and with two\r\nelements, air and water, in perfection, I found that I grew every hour\r\nmore and more attached to the place.”\r\n\r\nThis glowing description of the Old Man has worked a greater miracle\r\nthan that of changing water into wine. It has actually transmuted the\r\nspring of Schlangenbad into liquid gold—_aurum potabile!_ If the author\r\nbe accused of “exaggeration”—(now a dangerous term)—he may quote the\r\nsentiments of the ESCULAPIUS—the Apollo of the place.\r\n\r\n“Never did bath produce such delightful sensations as the Serpent’s Bath\r\nat Schlangenbad. These salubrious waters exert on the body an agreeable\r\nand gentle pressure—voluptuously expand the limbs—and tranquillize the\r\nnerves and the blood. You rise from the waters of Schlangenbad _like a\r\nPhœnix from its ashes_. Youth becomes more beautiful—more brilliant—and\r\nold age is imbued with new vigour.”[20]\r\n\r\nWell done Dr. Fenner! You have beaten the “Old Man of the Brunnens”\r\nfairly out of the field! Why the very waters themselves must have blushed\r\nwhen they saw the account of these their miraculous qualities—and the\r\nserpents must have waltzed merrily round the pine trees that overhang the\r\nsource of the magic Brunnen.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the whole is little more than an ingenious romance, closely\r\nallied to the legends of the neighbouring Rhine—as the story of the\r\nDrachenfels, for example. It is unnecessary to comment on the PHŒNIX\r\nof Dr. Fenner. That fabulous bird speaks for itself; but Sir F. Head’s\r\naccount requires some remark. In the first place, the appearance of the\r\nlimbs and body of the bather, is precisely the same as in other clear\r\nand tepid waters, as those of Wisbaden, Baden-Baden, Wildbad, &c.—or,\r\nindeed, in plain water. The “glittering phosphoric brightness,” and\r\nthe blanching and illumination of sinking bodies in tropical seas, are\r\nall the offspring of a fanciful or poetical imagination. Then again,\r\nthe soapy, satiny, and unctuous feel communicated by the Schlangenbad\r\nwaters, is not peculiar to them. The first time I ever bathed in the\r\nEms waters, many years ago, I remarked this, and can never forget the\r\nsense of _bien-être_ which I then experienced. And no wonder, for the\r\nwaters of Ems are infinitely more alkaline—especially in the baths—than\r\nthose of Schlangenbad. The effects, however, of these last on the skin,\r\nappeared to me more marked and pleasant than those of Wildbad, Wisbaden,\r\nor Baden-Baden. The tranquillity and sedative qualities of the Serpent’s\r\nBath are somewhat exaggerated by the “OLD MAN,” and outrageously so\r\nby Dr. Fenner; but nevertheless they possess these influences to a\r\nconsiderable extent.\r\n\r\nAnd here I must say that my friend Dr. Granville appears to have viewed\r\npoor Schlangenbad with a jaundiced eye.[21] The waters of the Kochbrunnen\r\nmay have stirred up the bile—for assuredly the waters of Schlangenbad\r\nare clearer, and the mountains are higher, and the trees are larger than\r\nhe has represented them. The very description of Captain Head proves the\r\ntransparency of the waters—and the following passage from Mr. Lee, which\r\nI can corroborate, will remove the stigma from the baths themselves.\r\n\r\n“The bathing-cabinets, notwithstanding the depreciating terms in which\r\nDr. Granville has spoken of them, are exceedingly convenient, more so,\r\nindeed, than at most other baths, and infinitely superior to the closets\r\nfor undressing adjoining the piscinæ at Wildbad. They are for the most\r\npart lofty and well ventilated, and are divided into a dressing-room and\r\na large and spacious marble _baignoire_ capable of containing five or\r\nsix persons; though it is only intended for a single person; bathing in\r\ncommon not being the practice at Schlangenbad. The bather consequently\r\nis not obliged to lie down in water about two feet deep, but has ample\r\nspace to play or move about, the water being admitted in large quantity,\r\nso as to rise nearly breast-high; the temperature can also be increased\r\nby the bather, at pleasure, by admitting more warm water, though some\r\npersons, in the height of summer, prefer bathing in the water at its\r\nnatural temperature,—about 22° Reaumur. A bath of this water, like others\r\nof the same class, imparts softness to the skin, with a pleasurable\r\nsensation while it lasts, and a feeling of _bien-être_ for the remainder\r\nof the day.”[22]\r\n\r\nThe waters of Schlangenbad contain only about six grains of solid\r\nsubstances in the pint—half of which is carbonate of soda—and very little\r\ncarbonic acid gas. Small as these ingredients are, they are larger than\r\nthose in the waters of Wildbad, or Pfeffers. They are, as Captain Head\r\nobserves, safe waters, both for bathing and drinking. The temperature\r\nbeing about 86°—something higher than Buxton, they may be used by many\r\npeople without any artificial increase. But, generally speaking, it will\r\nbe prudent to raise them ten or twelve degrees for gouty and rheumatic\r\npatients. Every body knows—or has been told—that the medicinal virtues of\r\nSchlangenbad waters were discovered by a hide-bound heifer—and proved by\r\na young lady under a similar state of skin. Whether this story be true or\r\nfabulous, I cannot tell; but I apprehend that its cosmetic and satinizing\r\nproperties are those which draw most of its foreign customers from the\r\nshores of the Baltic, and the banks of the Thames. Captain Head justly\r\nsuspects the durability of the satin skin—and there is little doubt that\r\nif half a pound of soda or potash were added to a common warm bath in\r\nEngland, the same softness of surface would be the result.\r\n\r\nI do not much wonder that the “Old Man” should have become enamoured\r\nof Schlangenbad, considering the disposition which he evinced for\r\nsolitude, contemplation, and reflection. The locality is well adapted for\r\nall these. Society is so concentrated in this little valetudinarium,\r\nand so quiet withal, that human nature may be studied with a kind\r\nof “microscopic eye,” and all its modifications, peculiarities, and\r\neccentricities noted without distraction or bustle. On the mountain’s\r\nromantic brow, under the shade of the sombre pine, and in the stillness\r\nand serenity of the forest, the mind has ample time to meditate on, and\r\ninwardly digest the observations made in the little miniature world below.\r\n\r\nAs one o’clock approached, the solitude of Schlangenbad began to exhibit\r\nsome symptoms of change. From various points of the compass isolated\r\nindividuals, bearing the marks of illness, were seen carefully picking\r\nout the softest—or, at all events, the _smoothest_ stones of the pavé,\r\nover which to wend their way, towards what an Irishman would call “three\r\ncentres” of attraction. Soon afterwards, we heard three or four bells\r\nsimultaneously sounding, when immediately the solitary videttes were\r\nsucceeded by whole columns marching to their appointed rendezvous. Never\r\ndid veteran Roman phalanx advance with more steady pace—more death-like\r\nsilence—or more inflexible resolution, to the assault of barbarian\r\nfoe, than does a German corps—men, women, and children—to the work of\r\ndemolition at a mittag table-d’hôte.\r\n\r\nFalling into the ranks of the largest column, we soon found ourselves in\r\nthe salle-a-manger of the New Bad Haus, where about one hundred sat down\r\nto dinner. There was a fair proportion of English—full an eighth of the\r\nwhole. There is little difficulty in distinguishing the German from the\r\nBritannic guests. The sallow complexion, black and broken teeth, matted\r\nlocks, extravagant mustachios—and transcendental salutations at meeting\r\nand parting—are some of the most prominent features of distinction; yet\r\nthere are many others of a minor cast.[24] An inferiority in the cloth\r\nof the coat—a peculiarity in what a sailor would call “the cut of the\r\njib”—enormous rings on the fingers, and brooches in the breast, are\r\ncharacteristic of our German neighbours. Independently of these, you may\r\nsmoke a German in any part of the room—or scent him at a quarter of a\r\nmile’s distance in the open air, if the wind be favourable. For although\r\nhe ceases to smoke when he begins to eat, yet from one pocket the reeking\r\npipe is exhaling its odours—while from the other, a load of the “cursed\r\nweed” itself is diffusing its aroma in all directions. But I find that\r\nI have been mistaken in giving a truce to smoking during the act of\r\neating. The fair author of “Souvenirs” has corrected me. “Yonder is an\r\nold gentleman actually eating and smoking at the same time—the long pipe\r\nbeing pushed into one corner of his mouth, so as to leave an entrance in\r\nfront for the spoon or fork.” On reading this passage, I could not help\r\nfeeling certain anatomical and physiological difficulties in the way of\r\nthis triple function of mastication, smoking, and swallowing, being all\r\nsimultaneous. I believe I can explain the phenomenon, however, without\r\nquestioning the fact of the fair writer. Every person must have seen a\r\nhorse eat oats and hay, with the bit of the bridle in his mouth. It was\r\nso with the old gentleman. All Germans have numerous vacancies among\r\ntheir grinders, and the one in question was able to keep his pipe ready\r\nlit for service between the courses, in one corner of his mouth. But it\r\nis certain that the triple or even double function of smoking and eating\r\nsimultaneously, is next to impossible.\r\n\r\nThese external peculiarities of the German are probably not more striking\r\nto John Bull, than are the singularities of the latter to the German. As\r\nto internal qualities—moral and intellectual—my conviction is, that the\r\nGerman has far more head and heart than nine-tenths of his continental\r\nand insular neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the more I have seen of the Germans, the more I admire their\r\nhonesty, zeal, single-heartedness, quietude, order, hospitality,\r\nlearning, and humanity. These solid qualities leave the little personal\r\npeculiarities which I have sketched above, as “dust in the balance.”\r\n\r\nIt is not quite so easy to discriminate between the German ladies and\r\nthose of our own country, as between the gentlemen of the two nations.\r\nOne reason is, that the German ladies do not smoke long pipes, and wear\r\nlong mustachios. I shall not libel the sex, as Pope has done, by making\r\nthe colour of the hair the characteristics of women:—\r\n\r\n    “And best distinguished by black, brown, or fair.”\r\n\r\nThere is one peculiarity in the manners of the German fair (besides\r\na certain “je ne sçais quoi,”) which is, their BOWING instead of\r\nCURTSEYING, on meeting or parting from friends—and that quite as low\r\nas their brothers, fathers, and husbands. This was the reason of my\r\nintroducing the term “_bussel_-rending” in the description of a German\r\nSALAAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE-D’HÔTE.\r\n\r\nNot being deeply versed in the science of gastronomy and its\r\nnomenclature, I shall introduce the following order and succession\r\nof dishes as drawn by a fair countrywoman (Souvenirs of a Summer in\r\nGermany,) whose fidelity of description cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\n“First, as usual, was the soup—then the invariable boiled beef, with its\r\naccompaniments of pickled cucumber, onions, or sour krout. After the\r\nbeef, is a course of cutlets, sliced raw ham, omelettes, and vegetables.\r\nThen come partridges, chickens, sausages, ducks—all which are replaced\r\nby various kinds of fish—some so besauced and bedecked with garnishes,\r\nthat they are hardly recognizable as belonging to the finny tribe—and\r\npyramidical dishes of cray-fish. The puddings come next, with smoking\r\nboats of fruit and wine-sauce. Is this the finale? Not at all. The\r\npudding is a kind of æra, whence fresh courses take their date. A more\r\nformidable array of dishes next makes its appearance. Roast joints—req,\r\n(a kind of deer,) geese, turkeys, hares, &c. &c. with innumerable\r\nsatellites of preserved pears, plums, cherries, salads, &c. This\r\nsubstantial course is followed by sweets—cherry tarts—enormous cakes,\r\nall spices and vanille with a snowy summit of powdered sugar—custards,\r\ncreams, &c. The dessert and bon-bons close the proceedings.”\r\n\r\nNow, it is to be observed, that this was the bill of fare at Schwalbach\r\nor Schlangenbad, where nine-tenths of the guests are notoriously\r\ninvalids. It would scarcely serve for a dejeuner a la fourçhette at the\r\nsumptuaries of Baden or Wisbaden. The fair authoress admits that the\r\nGerman partakes of every dish; but argues that he does not eat more\r\nin the aggregate than the Englishman. This statement is so decidedly\r\ncontrary to all observation, that I can only account for it by supposing\r\nthat the fair lady noted more accurately the compliments to “la belle\r\nAnglaise,” proceeding out of the mouths of her favourite Germans, than\r\nthe provender which proceeded in a contrary direction. Is it likely that\r\nthe keeper of a German hotel would dress more dishes than are generally\r\nconsumed, seeing that the price of the whole dinner is under two\r\nshillings? Not he indeed. The fact is undeniable that the Germans—indeed\r\nall the continentals who can afford it, eat not only a greater variety\r\nand complication of “dishes tortured from their native taste,” but a\r\ngreater quantity in the aggregate. The question naturally arises—what is\r\nthe consequence? Compare the complexions of the Germans and English. No\r\none will attempt to deny that the contrast is most striking. The tints of\r\nhealth predominate in the looks of the Islanders—pallor and sallowness\r\nin those of the Continental. But the lady may reply—“nimium ne crede\r\ncolori”—complexion, like beauty, is only skin-deep. Be it so. We shall\r\nlook deeper. Let us follow the example of the horse-dealer, and examine\r\nthe teeth. If my fair countrywoman has preserved any “souvenirs” of these\r\nimportant actors in the drama of human life, she will not be inclined to\r\nmaintain that a German is like an elephant—with a mouth full of ivory.\r\nI never saw the hearty laugh of an honest German, without thinking of a\r\ntemple—whose portal consisted of broken columns of ebony. If 40 Germans,\r\nat the age of 40, were compared with the same number of English, at\r\nthe same age—all taken indiscriminately from the streets of Vienna and\r\nLondon—what would be the comparative number of sound teeth in the heads\r\nof the two classes? I shall attempt a calculation presently; mean time,\r\nit will be admitted on all hands, that the Germans are woefully afflicted\r\nwith unsound teeth. What is the reason? A pair of mill-stones will\r\ngrind only a certain quantity of corn—or last only a certain number of\r\nyears. It is the same with the human mill-stones, or molares. They will\r\nonly grind a certain quantity of food, or do a certain amount of labour,\r\nbefore they are worn out, like their namesakes in the mill. Now if the\r\nGermans eat one-third more than the English—and I firmly believe they\r\ndo—then their teeth have one-third more of work, and ought to experience\r\na corresponding degree of wear and tear. This, however, will not account\r\nfor the premature decay of the teeth, but only for their wearing out\r\nsooner than under other circumstances. We must seek deeper for the\r\ncauses. As the millstones are spoiled and rendered useless by allowing\r\nimproper things to be mixed with the grain, as pebbles, &c. so the teeth\r\nare injured by the quality as well as by the quantity of our food. The\r\noils, acids, tobacco, and other deleterious substances, for ever mixing\r\nwith continental meals, must greatly injure the organs of mastication as\r\nwell as of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe human frame is a congeries of organs, all in harmony, when in health,\r\nand each assisting the others. But when we deviate from simplicity and\r\ntemperance, these same organs quarrel with each other, to the detriment,\r\nand sometimes to the destruction of the whole constitution. The stomach\r\nis one of those patient and willing organs that will work wonders for\r\nyears and years; but at length it will rebel—and even retaliate. The\r\nteeth, which have long sent down immoderate quantities of food, too\r\noften of the most abominable composition, for the stomach to grind over\r\nagain, become visited with pains and penalties by the offended organ,\r\nunder the vain hope that less work will be done in the upper mill.\r\nThe warning is unheeded; and then the stomach begins the process of\r\ndemolition in good earnest. It is in this state of, what the geologists\r\nwould call “transition,” that we see the teeth of the Germans—and, it\r\nmust be confessed, of the English sometimes also—in a state disagreeable\r\nto the eye, offensive to the nose, and injurious to the health. The\r\nstomach, which has inflicted this punishment on the mouth, so far from\r\nbeing benefitted thereby, is still farther injured by the failure of\r\nmastication; and then the various organs and functions of the body become\r\ninvolved in the consequences of long-continued deviations from the paths\r\nof Nature, simplicity, and temperance!\r\n\r\nIf this penalty be still considered as imaginary, I shall adduce more\r\ncogent arguments. The bills of mortality contain very stubborn facts.\r\nLet us take the two capitals of Germany and England—Vienna and London.\r\nIn the _former_, one twenty-fourth of the population goes to the grave\r\nannually:—in the latter (London) one-fortieth part only. In the language\r\nof the insurance-offices, “the value of life is more than one-third\r\ngreater in London than in Vienna.” Now this difference will surely\r\nnot be attributed to climate merely—since the continentals themselves\r\nanathematize the climate of England, and the fogs of London, as most\r\n“horrid.” Here then we have some clue to the comparative number of teeth\r\nin individuals of the same age, at home and abroad. We shall probably\r\nfind the proportion of 24 to 40 (the ratio of mortality) as exhibiting a\r\nfair estimate of the number of teeth in equal masses of the population\r\nin Germany and England. Thus, for example, if the Englishman, at the age\r\nof 50, have twenty teeth in his head, the German, at the same period of\r\nlife, will have only twelve, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the table-d’hôte. A glance round the “SALLE-A-MANGER”\r\nbrought a strong conviction on my mind, that FAME had either exaggerated\r\nthe virtues of the Serpent’s Bath, or had excited hopes that would\r\nseldom be realized. A majority of the guests were females; and not a\r\nfew of these were of a certain—or rather of an _uncertain_, age. Of\r\nthe males, the greater number were evidently dandies in decay. I never\r\nremember to have seen, in the same compass, a greater variety of feature\r\nand complexion—indicating a re-union, in this sequestered spot, of\r\nindividuals from various and remote regions. But however diversified in\r\nexternal physiognomy, there was one point in which there was a wonderful\r\ncoincidence and similarity—that point was—_not_ the point of BEAUTY. It\r\nis with mortification, I confess, that the English portion of the guests\r\ndid not form a prominent exception to the general rule. To say the truth,\r\nthe whole company exhibited sorry samples of the great European and\r\nTransatlantic family;—and if appetite was any index, the majority had\r\nmet here, partly for health, but principally for—RE-_creation_. How far\r\nthe transmutation from age to youth—from decrepitude to vigour—from the\r\nwrinkled skin to the polished surface, was effected by plunges in the\r\nSerpent’s Bath, I had not time to ascertain. I candidly acknowledge that\r\nI never saw a _real_ phœnix—but if _these_ were specimens of Dr. Fenner’s\r\nphœnixes, “rising from their ashes,” then I must say that they very much\r\nresembled a batch of old cocks and hens roosting at Schlangenbad during\r\nthe molting season.\r\n\r\nThe first impression which a stranger receives, while prying through\r\nSchlangenbad, is that the waters have an uglifying rather than a\r\nbeautifying effect on the human frame. This is erroneous. We do not\r\ngo through the wards of an hospital to search for samples of rude\r\nhealth—neither ought we to go to Schlangenbad for specimens of smooth\r\nskin and delicate complexion.\r\n\r\nWe rambled through winding and umbrageous paths up the mountain behind\r\nthe Old Bad-haus, to its summit—and I think there are few places in\r\nthe world better adapted to profound meditation, while, at the same\r\ntime, inspiring the most pure, bracing, and salubrious atmosphere. I\r\ndescended in a contemplative mood, when I stumbled into a long kind of\r\ngallery or hall, which looked like an enclosed promenade. There the\r\naccursed ROULETTE-table met my eye and excited my choler. What! In this\r\nvalley of Rasselas—in this asylum of health—in this peaceful retreat\r\nfrom the stormy passions of the city—to find the symbol of Hell, and\r\nthe instrument of the devil, was more than I could bear with patience!\r\nTrue, it was deserted. Not a human being was seen in the place; but its\r\npresence indicated too surely the work of destruction that would go on\r\nin the evening. Julius Cæsar, I think, observed that the Germans, in his\r\ntime, were so passionately addicted to gambling, that, when they had lost\r\nall their money and goods, they would stake their wives and children! It\r\ntherefore seems to be impossible to eradicate this dreadful propensity\r\nfrom the German mind. Still the public exercise of it might be prevented.\r\nThe King of Saxony prohibits and _prevents_ smoking in Dresden! If such a\r\nmiracle as this can be wrought in Germany, we need not despair, even of\r\ngambling!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHWALBACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wizzard of Nassau—the knight of the “Bubbles,” has wrought a real\r\nmodern miracle—the transmutation of water into wine, or rather into\r\nnectar.\r\n\r\n    “The conscious Brunnens saw their god and blushed.”\r\n\r\nEvery spring in the Duchy has danced more merrily, and bubbled more\r\nbriskly to the beams of the rising sun, since the children of Albion have\r\nswarmed round the living fountains, in search of health or amusement.\r\nWell may Dr. Fenner say—“cette reputation est due surtout aux Anglais.\r\nLa plume caustique de HEAD a puissament contribué à nous faire-faire une\r\nconnaissance plus intime avec cette nation.” The pen of Sir Francis may\r\nbe likened to the bath of Schlangenbad—\r\n\r\n    “Nullum tetigit quod non ornavit.”\r\n\r\nBy “ornavit” I do not mean the _embellishment_ which is sometimes\r\nsynonymous with exaggerations or distortions; but merely that charm which\r\nthe pen of genius can throw round the most common subjects. Schwalbach is\r\nstill as it was, in a deep narrow valley—and invisible till we are within\r\na few hundred yards of it. The houses, though more generally painted, and\r\ngreatly increased in number since the time of the “Old Man,” are still as\r\nthough they had been shaken in a bag and scattered through the ravine,\r\nwithout the slightest regard to order or regularity. Sir Francis could\r\nfind no shops in his time—now he would find a bazaar! The town is still\r\nsomewhat in the form of a Y or a fork, at the end of one prong of which\r\nis the STAHL-BRUNNEN—while the other prong, or rather prongs, boasts\r\nof two hygeian fountains—the WEIN-BRUNNEN and the PAULINEN-BRUNNEN.\r\nThe WEIN-BRUNNEN is the most powerful—the STAHL-BRUNNEN is the most\r\npalatable—and the PAULINE is the most fashionable. The climate of this\r\nplace, according to the testimony of Dr. Fenner, supported by that of Sir\r\nF. Head and others, is very pleasant and salubrious. On the hills we have\r\ncool breezes—in the valley shelter from cold winds—in the woods, ample\r\nshade beneath umbrageous foliage, when the sun is powerful and the heat\r\noppressive.\r\n\r\nWhen the “bad humours” of the spa-going invalids have been washed away by\r\ncopious libations at Aix-la-Chapelle, Ems, and Wisbaden—when the gouty\r\nand misshapen limbs have shrunk into “the lean and slippered pantaloon,”\r\nbeneath the powerful influence of the Kochbrunnen, the Ragoczy, and the\r\nSprudel—when the purple nose of the alderman has faded into the pale\r\nproboscis—when the turgid liver, the tumid spleen, and the over-fed\r\ncorporation have receded within the normal boundaries of a double-reefed\r\nwaistcoat—when the knotty and contracted joints of rheumatic gout have\r\ntaken their departure, leaving a legacy of the crutches—when—\r\n\r\n    “Wrapp’d in his robe, white LEPRA hides his stains,\r\n    Robb’d of his strength, but unsubdued his pains”—\r\n\r\nwhen tottering palsy has been discharged from Wisbaden and Wildbad,\r\nas much reduced in general, as recruited in local power—when blighted\r\nambition, wounded pride, ruined fortunes, and corroding cares, have\r\nsapped the energies of mind and body, and marked their impress on the\r\npale and sickly countenance—when the “green and yellow melancholy” of\r\nhopeless love or severed affections wanes to the alabaster hue on the\r\nmaiden’s cheek—then SCHWALBACH, with its ruby fountains and sparkling\r\ngases, comes to the rescue, and works as many miracles and metamorphoses\r\nas steel and carbonic acid can any where effect. The saline spas of\r\nGermany are all of the radical cast. They are qualified to break down\r\nand expel the rotten and decayed parts of the constitution—but they can\r\nseldom build up or repair the vacant spaces. The chalybeate spas, among\r\nwhich SCHWALBACH holds a distinguished rank, unite the principles of\r\nconservatism and reform. They are calculated to preserve the original\r\nconstitution, and to _re_-form those portions that have been pulled down\r\nand extruded by the “_mouvement_,” or radical waters of the saline class.\r\n\r\nIn none of the three springs is there more than three-fourths of a grain\r\nof iron to the pint—and in the Pauline—the most fashionable one—there is\r\nlittle more than half a grain; but it contains nearly 40 cubic inches\r\nof carbonic acid gas to the pint, which, with six grains of carbonate\r\nof sodium, two grains of carbonate of lime, and nearly three grains of\r\nmagnesia, makes it the most ætherial and aperient of the three sisters.\r\nThe water of the Wein-brunnen is limpid, pleasant to the taste, and\r\nsparkling like champaigne. It is very easy of digestion, even when taken\r\nin considerable quantity. Almost immediately after being swallowed,\r\nit produces an agreeable warmth in the stomach, and thence diffuses a\r\nsensation of comfort, nearly amounting to pleasure, through the whole\r\nframe. It acts gently on the bowels in most cases. It is easily preserved\r\nin bottles for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThe Stahl-brunnen is the greatest favourite with the ladies. It contains\r\nabout three-fourths of a grain of iron, and little more than three grains\r\nof other substances in the pint. It is sharper and rougher to the taste,\r\nand has more of the inky gout than either of the other springs. It is\r\nalso much more refreshing and exhilarating. The carbonic acid is very\r\nabundant. The waters more nearly resemble Champaigne than the other\r\nsources, and quickly diffuse a powerful energy over the whole frame.\r\nFormerly these waters caused an eruption on the skin; but they do not so\r\nat present.\r\n\r\nThe Pauline was only discovered in 1828, at a depth of fourteen feet. The\r\nquantity it discharges is prodigious. The taste is extremely agreeable\r\nand refreshing. It is one of the mildest and purest chalybeates that is\r\nknown. It is very easy of digestion, and operates very gently on the\r\nbowels. By quickly amalgamating itself with the blood, it is rapidly\r\ndiffused through every organ and tissue of the body, producing favourable\r\nchanges there, and proving a general restorative. The vigor which it\r\ninspires is remarkable from day to day—and the change of complexion from\r\npale to rosy, is equally surprising.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Schwalbach, generally belong to the class of æthereal or\r\nvolatile chalybeates—very agreeable to the palate, and producing a slight\r\nand temporary feeling of intoxication. Their chief ingredients are steel\r\nand carbonic acid, in such a state of combination as gives the iron a\r\ngreat efficacy in consequence of its minute solution in the waters.\r\n\r\n“At the same time (says Dr. Fenner,) that this spring causes agreeable\r\nsensations in the palate and stomach, it excites the muscular fibres\r\nand the nerves of the whole alimentary canal, into a state of\r\nactivity—invigorates the circulation—corrects the secretions—increases\r\nthem when defective—and gives new vigor to the whole process of digestion\r\nand nutrition. In doing this it enlivens the spirits, and imparts tone to\r\nthe intellectual functions.”\r\n\r\nThe indications for using the Schwalbach chalybeates, according to the\r\nsame authority, are the following:—\r\n\r\n1. In atony or debility of the stomach and bowels, whether from natural\r\nconstitution, or from excesses previously committed—whether isolated\r\nfrom other complaints, or connected with affections of other organs, as\r\nthe liver, spleen, &c. This atony eventuating in difficult, painful,\r\nor imperfect digestion, with all its consequences, is remedied by the\r\nwaters. It is in these kinds of complaints that the Stahl-brunnen is\r\nchiefly employed—“the Wein-brunnen being too strong, and the Pauline too\r\nvolatile.” Strict regimen, in such cases, is indispensible.\r\n\r\n2. When the blood is in a watery or deteriorated condition—when it is\r\ndeficient in red globules—and consequently not fitted to support the\r\nenergies of the muscles, the tone of the nerves, or the functions of the\r\ngreat organs of assimilation, secretion, &c. It is in such cases that\r\nthe chalybeates produce their most brilliant and unequivocally good\r\neffects. Females, from the delicacy of their constitutions, the effects\r\nof civilization, and certain disorders to which their sex subjects them,\r\nare the peculiar votaries of these springs. Hence those affected with\r\nchlorosis—with hæmorrhages—with menorrhagia—hysteria—obstructions, &c.\r\nare seen flocking to Schwalbach, there to regain strength, colour, and\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n“Quels que les noms des maladies qui se developpent, ici le malade peut\r\nesperer, avec raison, d’etre gueri. Quelques semaines suffisent souvent\r\npour regenerer ses humeurs d’une maniere sensible.”\r\n\r\nAlthough this is the assurance of a SPA DOCTOR, yet the nature of these\r\nwaters, and the reputation they have obtained, produce a considerable\r\ndegree of confidence in the assertion of Dr. Fenner.\r\n\r\n3. In great weakness of the nerves, and where their influence is not\r\nsufficient to impart energy to the various functions, particularly of\r\nchylification and sanguification, the chalybeates of Schwalbach are said\r\nto have proved eminently serviceable. Dr. Fenner asserts their efficacy\r\nin hypochondriasis, hysteria, melancholia, and in partial and complete\r\nparalysis. In sterility they have also acquired considerable reputation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTER-INDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Schwalbach have limits to their medicinal agency, and are\r\neven injurious in many states of disease.\r\n\r\n1. In plethoric states of the constitution, accompanied by irritable\r\ncondition of the heart and great vessels—in sanguineous temperaments—and\r\nin all cases where there is a tendency to local inflammation or general\r\nfever—or even to congestion in any of the organs or tissues of the body.\r\n“High attacks of acute inflammation, of hæmorrhage, and of apoplexy, have\r\nfollowed the imprudent employment of these chalybeates.”—_Fenner._\r\n\r\n2. In those cases of indigestion, connected with, or dependent on,\r\norganic disease of stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, or mesenteric glands,\r\nthese waters would be improper and hurtful.\r\n\r\n3. But the chalybeates of Schwalbach are not to be recommended in cases\r\nwhere the vital powers are _greatly_ prostrated—the blood and humours\r\nextremely vitiated—or the nervous system too much shattered. “Those\r\nwho venture on these waters, under such circumstances, and where the\r\nconstitution is at so low an ebb,—‘trouvent, loin des siens et de leur\r\npatrie, une mort certaine et premature.’”—_Fenner._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe waters are taken fasting. The best season is the spring and summer.\r\nFrom one to three glasses are prescribed, with a quarter of an hour’s\r\nexercise between each glass. After this a light breakfast, where the bath\r\nis not used.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATHS.\r\n\r\nThese are prescribed in the morning, after taking a glass or two of the\r\nwaters. They are generally given at a low temperature, such as 90° of\r\nFahrenheit, unless ordered otherwise. They therefore are several degrees\r\nlower than the heat of the bather’s blood, and about the same heat as the\r\n_external_ surface of the body. They feel neither warm nor cold; but it\r\nis asserted by Sir F. Head, who used them for some time, that they impart\r\na feeling of invigoration soon after immersion—and “he could almost have\r\nfancied himself lying with a set of hides in a tan-pit.” The same author\r\nremarks that they are very apt to produce—“headaches, sleepiness, and\r\nother slightly apoplectic symptoms.” He thinks these effects must result\r\nfrom not immersing the head as well as the body. In this he is mistaken.\r\nThe best way to avoid such consequences is to keep the head cool—and the\r\natmosphere of the bath is and must be many degrees below that of the\r\nwater. The bare head will therefore be cooler out of the bath than in it.\r\nBut the fact is, that the symptoms above-mentioned are not seldom apt to\r\noccur in all tepid and warm baths, from the action of the waters on the\r\nnervous and vascular systems of the surface, producing an excitement and\r\ndetermination to the brain. They should be taken as warnings, and not be\r\ntrifled with.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the waters of Schwalbach, from what I could learn on\r\nthe spot, and from those who have prescribed them, and used them, are\r\nvery useful and mild chalybeates, which may be considered as a kind of\r\n“FINISH,” after the powerful alterative waters of Wisbaden, and the\r\nstrong alkaline waters of Ems;—always remembering that SCHLANGENBAD is to\r\ngive a _polish_ to the surface at the end of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN SOCIETY AND MANNERS.\r\n\r\nThere are few places where a stranger can have a better coup-d’œil\r\nof German habits and manners, than at the SPAS; where all ranks and\r\nclasses, from the prince to the peasant, are jumbled together, without\r\never jostling each other. They drink together, bathe together, walk\r\ntogether, talk together, smoke together, joke together, dine together,\r\nmuse together, sup together—and, then go to bed, all with the greatest\r\ndecorum, quietude, civility—and I may add, ceremony.\r\n\r\n“The company,” says Sir F. Head, “which comes to the brunnens for\r\nhealth, and which daily assembles at dinner, is of a most heterogeneous\r\ndescription, being composed of princes, dukes, barons, counts, &c. down\r\nto the petty shop-keeper, and even the Jew of Frankfort, Mainz, and other\r\nneighbouring towns; in short, all the most jarring elements of society,\r\nat the same moment, enter the same room, to partake together, the same\r\none shilling and eight-penny dinner—still, all those invaluable forms\r\nof society which connect the guests of any private individual were\r\nmost strictly observed; and, from the natural good sense and breeding\r\nin the country, this happy combination was apparently effected without\r\nany effort. No one seemed to be under any restraint, yet there was no\r\nfreezing formality at one end of the table, nor rude boisterous mirth\r\nat the other. With as honest good appetites as could belong to any set\r\nof people under the sun, I particularly remarked that there was no\r\nscrambling for favourite dishes;—to be sure, here and there, an eye was\r\nseen twinkling a little brighter than usual, as it watched the progress\r\nof any approaching dish which appeared to be unusually sour or greasy,\r\nbut there was no greediness, no impatience, and nothing which seemed\r\nfor a single moment to interrupt the general harmony of the scene; and,\r\nthough I scarcely heard a syllable of the buzz of conversation which\r\nsurrounded me; although every moment I felt less and less disposed to\r\nattempt to eat what for some time had gradually been coagulating in my\r\nplate; yet, leaning back in my chair, I certainly did derive very great\r\npleasure, and I hope a very rational enjoyment, in looking upon so\r\npleasing a picture of civilized life.”\r\n\r\nIt must be candidly confessed that this scene, which is every where the\r\nsame, exhibits a striking contrast to spa-society in England, where\r\neach class forms a clique that repels its neighbour, as one electrified\r\nball repels another. It is therefore highly desirable that the _cause_\r\nof this happy concordance throughout the whole chain of society on the\r\nContinent, should be ascertained, in order, if possible, to introduce it\r\ninto our own country. Sir F. Head seems to attribute it to a high degree\r\nof _civilization or refinement_. “I fear it cannot be denied that we\r\nislanders are very far from being as highly polished as our continental\r\nneighbours.” If civilization consist in _civility_, I admit the truth of\r\nthis assertion. But a Gentoo is even more _civil_ than a German—and a\r\nChinese is more ceremonious than either—yet we do not place the Hindoo or\r\nthe Hong at the very top of the tree of civilization.\r\n\r\nBut I apprehend that this harmonious amalgamation of all ranks and\r\nclasses in Germany is not to be traced to one, but to several causes. I\r\nwould attempt to account for the phenomenon by one, or more, or all of\r\nthe following circumstances.\r\n\r\n1. Natural disposition.—2. Education, inducing habit.—3. Comparative\r\npaucity of trade, commerce, and manufactures.—4. Government.\r\n\r\n1. We see peculiarities in the natural dispositions of nations, as\r\nwell as of men. Some evince a disposition to music, another to arms,\r\na third to navigation, a fourth to agriculture, a fifth to commerce,\r\n&c. The Germans may have a natural disposition to order, quietude, and\r\npoliteness. Of this I am by no means sure.\r\n\r\n2. What is man, individually or collectively, but the creature of those\r\ncircumstances in which he is placed?—of the elements around him—of the\r\neducation impressed on him—of the religion within his breast—of the\r\nexamples before his eyes? In all the lauded and laudable traits of\r\ncharacter delineated by Sir. F. Head, the German has been trained from\r\nhis infancy—and from these he has neither inducement nor inclination to\r\ndeviate.\r\n\r\n3. The third circumstance I consider to be very operative. The struggles,\r\nthe collisions, the jealousies—the host of evil and of exciting passions,\r\nwhich agitate a commercial, trading, maritime, and manufacturing country\r\nlike England, have, comparatively, no field in Germany; where life is\r\nfar more allied to agricultural and pastoral, than to commercial and\r\nmanufacturing pursuits. There is as much difference between the Germans\r\nand the English, generally, as between the peasantry of Lincolnshire and\r\nthe mechanics of Birmingham—between the chaw-bacons of Hampshire, and the\r\nblack and white devils of Merthyr-Tidvill and Sheffield.\r\n\r\n4. _Government._—I attribute no small share to this class of influential\r\ncauses in modifying the manners of a nation. In absolute monarchies,\r\nwhere the will of the sovereign is the law of the people, the _latter_\r\nare not likely to be so frisky, boisterous, and turbulent, as under a\r\nlimited and constitutional government, inclining to democracy, where the\r\nvox populi is not seldom the vox Dei—and where—\r\n\r\n                    ——Imprisoned factions roar,\r\n    And rampant Treason stalks from shore to shore.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I shall allude to the minuteness with which the\r\nGerman governments regulate the most trifling concerns of life, when\r\nmentioning that a passenger in a public diligence is forbidden to move\r\nfrom the seat allotted to him, to the next vacant one at his side,\r\nwithout permission from the post-master of the first town at which the\r\nconveyance stops! In such countries would the Age, the Satirist, or even\r\nthe TIMES be long allowed to take liberties with crowned heads, courts,\r\nor ministers? No verily! Their tongues would soon be as smooth, and\r\ncivil and ceremonious, as those of the crowds of spa-drinkers around the\r\nWein-Brunnen of Schwalbach![25]\r\n\r\nWhether the state of things on the South side of the Channel be better\r\nor worse than that on the North, I presume not to say. Davus sum, non\r\nŒdipus. But I think I have proved that, while these differences exist,\r\nthe manners and habits of Germany are not likely to blend or amalgamate\r\nwith those of England. Nothing, I think, would produce this fusion of\r\nthe two people, except some strange geographical revolution that might\r\nconvert the British Isles into a small appendix to the Continent; without\r\n“ships, colonies, or commerce”—without iron mines or coal mines—without\r\ncotton or cutlery—without fisheries or factories—without steam-engines\r\nor printing-presses—but above all, without that great national or normal\r\nschool of agitation—the PARLIAMENT—where deputies learn to “speak\r\ndaggers,” and chartists are encouraged to make pikes—where orations\r\nare directed not to the ears of the COMMONS, but to the eyes of the\r\nCONSTITUENTS—where the campaign is opened with a speech recommending\r\nconcord; carried on with speeches full of discord; and concluded with a\r\nspeech of gracious accord—finally, where multiplicity of _motion_ in the\r\nbeginning is synonymous with paucity of _action_ in the end. When all\r\nthese incentives to turbulence shall have vanished, and also when English\r\nstomachs shall prefer sour krout and rancid oil to roast beef and brown\r\nstout, then, and not till then, may Sir Francis hope to see his favourite\r\nGerman _polish_ and Gallic _varnish_ lacquering over the rough manners of\r\nhis native Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEIDELBERG.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany a time have I dragged my weary limbs up the series of steep terraces\r\nthat lead to the old red Castle of Heidelberg. Not being able to feign\r\necstasies which I do not feel, I fear I shall give great offence to those\r\nsentimental tourists who discover in this town, castle, and surmounting\r\nhills, romantic views and picturesque beauties of the first order. Upon\r\nthis, as upon all other occasions, I appeal to the unbiassed feelings\r\nof the traveller himself. The mouldering ruins of the Red Castle have\r\nsomething about them too modern for antiquity, and too antiquated for\r\nthe modern. I am unable to give any _architectural_ explanation of this\r\nimpression—unless it be the following:\r\n\r\n    “I do not like thee Mr. Bell,\r\n    The reason why, I cannot tell!”\r\n\r\nThe view from the Castle, and from the Botanical Garden above it, over\r\nthe alluvial plain that stretches to the Rhine, and embracing the country\r\nto the West of that river, is interesting, but neither striking nor\r\nromantic. The tiny NECKAR, that meanders along its rocky bed, in the\r\ntravelling season, excites our apprehensions lest it should fare the fate\r\nof the Arethusa, and disappear altogether. When heavy rains descend among\r\nthe mountains of the Black Forest however, it makes up for its torpidity\r\nin the dry weather, and thunders past Heidelberg in great foam and fury.\r\n\r\nIn rambling through the streets of Heidelberg, whose University is one\r\nof the crack seminaries in Germany, we cannot help recognizing the\r\nstudents, although deprived of their red caps and long hair, by order of\r\nGovernment. They have a semi-academic, semi-barbarous,—or, perhaps, more\r\nproperly speaking, a semi-ruminating, semi-fumigating appearance, not\r\nvery distantly allied to the revolutionary or bandittal.\r\n\r\nThe German students of this and other Universities having ineffectually\r\nendeavoured to regenerate—_id est_—to revolutionize their country, were\r\nput under the _ban_ of Austria and Prussia, a procedure which very\r\ncompletely secured them against doing any mischief—_to the State_. Thus\r\ncramped in their generous and patriotic enterprize to involve society\r\nin war, they formed societies for warring among themselves, called the\r\nVERBONDUNGS, or congresses, for regulating, arranging, and conducting\r\nduels!! The following graphic description of one of these fights, was\r\ndrawn up on the scene of action, in November 1839, by an eye-witness.\r\n\r\n“On Wednesday last, as I took my customary walk after dinner, a friend\r\ncame up to me, and told me that he perceived by various circumstances\r\nthat a ‘lorgehen’ was about to take place. He pointed out to me a\r\nman sauntering lazily along the bridge, with a basket slung over his\r\nshoulder, and who stopped at every minute to look down into the water, or\r\nwatch a barge dragged with difficulty against the stream by its single\r\nhorse. An old woman sat at the corner of a house, a short distance up the\r\nriver, in a position which commanded a view of the bridge and the road\r\nfrom the town, and a man pushed a boat about objectless in the middle of\r\nthe river. These, to the initiated eye, gave certain evidence of what was\r\ngoing on; these persons being all employed in watching, that an alarm\r\nmay be given in case of the police gaining information of the affair.\r\nWe walked for some distance up the right bank of the Neckar, till we\r\narrived at the opening of a mountain gorge, down which a small stream\r\nrushed impetuously, and from which a girl was apparently filling her\r\npails. We ascended this pass for a short distance till we arrived at a\r\ndirty, dilapidated house, which my companion pointed out as the scene of\r\nthese disgraceful combats. We ascended to the door of the beer-shop by a\r\nflight of broken steps, and passed through a passage into a yard, where\r\ntwo men were grinding, to the highest pitch of sharpness, a long, thin,\r\nbasket-handled rapier; the blade resembled, in shape and sharpness, two\r\nblades of a pen-knife placed back to back. In a few minutes we mounted\r\nto the first floor, and traversing a low room set out with tables and\r\nbenches for refreshment, passed into a lofty and spacious saloon, without\r\nfurniture of any sort, but a few forms placed against the walls, and a\r\ntable with towels and a basin of water, in one corner. In the opposite\r\ncorner of the room, at about four yards apart, were marked upon the\r\nfloor two letters in chalk; these, the initials of the verbondungs to\r\nwhich the combatants belonged, marked the position of the fighters. A\r\nfew students stood listlessly about, smoking or talking in whispers. A\r\nman entered, and threw down near the scene of action a bundle of swords,\r\na huge, thickly stuffed glove, reaching to the shoulder, and a piece\r\nof matting resembling a mattress, to be tied round the middle of the\r\nsecond, to guard against chance thrusts. Thus some minutes passed, till\r\nat length one of the gladiators themselves appeared. He was a short,\r\nbut strongly and beautifully proportioned young man, having a pleasing\r\ncountenance, with a thin silky moustache, and long glossy, black hair,\r\nreaching far below his cap, which was drawn closely over his eyes, and\r\nbore the colours of his club. His body, from the chest downwards, was\r\nenveloped in a thickly stuffed leather apron, impervious to every blow,\r\nbut slashed and stained in a hundred places from the effects of former\r\ncontests. The neck was covered also with a thick defence, above which\r\nhe could hardly lift his chin. Lastly, his right arm was bandaged, and\r\nwrapped so carefully with paddings, that it was necessary to have a\r\nperson to support it until the moment of fighting. The body was only\r\ncovered by a ragged and dirt-soiled shirt. Thus equipped, with his\r\nsword-arm resting on the neck of a companion, the little hero began to\r\nwalk up and down the room to promote circulation and to exercise the\r\nlimbs. In a few minutes his antagonist entered, habited in the same\r\nmanner, his cap decked with his peculiar colour, resting his arm likewise\r\non a friend. He was a tall and handsome youth, his face was pale as\r\ndeath, but his step was firm as he paced the saloon for the same purpose\r\nas the other. At this minute not a sound was heard but the tramping of\r\nthe two combatants and their seconds as they passed and repassed each\r\nother without the slightest regard. Neither of them spoke a word, and the\r\nseconds but seldom addressed to them in a whisper some sentence of advice\r\nor caution. Presently a movement was observed towards the approaching\r\nscene of action; the few and almost indifferent spectators drew round,\r\nand a chair was placed within, beside which the judge stood to mark\r\nthe number of the rounds. The combatants were led to their respective\r\nposts, their right arms extended, holding their rapiers in hand, and\r\nresting still on the arm of a friend. The seconds planted themselves\r\nat their left side, equipped in their defensive trappings, and holding\r\nabove their heads a blunted sword. ‘_Silentium!_’ exclaimed the judge.\r\nThe quiet which reigned before became instantly doubly quiet. One second\r\ncried aloud, ‘_Verbindite Kling_’ (‘fasten blades’ literally), placing\r\nat the same time, the point of his mock weapon a little in advance of\r\nhis principal, the other doing likewise. ‘_Los_’ instantly followed, and\r\nthe glittering swords of the two gladiators were crossed for battle. A\r\nmoment they looked at one another, then their blades flashed in the air,\r\na blow was struck and parried, and the seconds struck their arms up with\r\na cry of ‘Halt!’ The heavy sword arm was again rested on the attendants,\r\nand a moment’s pause ensued. ‘_Silentium!_’ repeated the judge, and\r\nanother round began. Whenever a blow was aimed, whether it took effect\r\nor not, the seconds interfered, and the round was ended. Thus they\r\ncontinued through twenty-two onsets without pause, except to replace\r\na broken blade, or for a fresh cap on the head of the combatants. The\r\nlatter of the two was a wary swordsman, who had fought frequently before.\r\nHe watched cautiously the movement of his adversary, and, whenever his\r\nstroke failed, made a quick and well-directed blow at his head. He,\r\nthough it was his first battle, guarded well: but at length the blade\r\nof his opponent passed like lightning through his cap, and inflicted\r\nan awful wound on his head. A large space was laid bare, and his whole\r\nperson deluged in blood: his long thick hair hung matted and discoloured\r\nover his shoulders. In a few moments, however, he retaliated fully\r\nupon his antagonist, his face was laid open from the ear to the nose,\r\neffectually marking him for life. In all, five wounds were given, three\r\nof which the smaller of the two received, having, besides that on the\r\nhead, one under the right arm and one under the ear; the other had also\r\na gash under the ear. In about twenty minutes the number of onsets was\r\ncompleted; the combatants retired, their padding was taken off, and the\r\nworst part of the affair began—namely, the sewing up of the wounds. Here\r\nthey are in the habit (as if to punish as much as possible the folly of\r\nthese duels) of _sewing_ up even comparatively trifling wounds, so that\r\nthe mark is seen certainly for years after its infliction. The tall man\r\nin a short time was able to walk home; the other, however, was compelled\r\nto have a carriage, so weak had he become from loss of blood. This, I\r\nmust tell you, was an unusually bloody combat, as in two others, which I\r\nsaw immediately after, not a single wound was given. The average number\r\nof duels taking place daily is seven: the consequence is, that every\r\nthird man you meet in the street has a gash across his face.”\r\n\r\nBad as is British pugilism, it is exceeded in atrocity by this barbarous\r\nsystem of German duelism. What says the government to it? Virtually\r\nand literally this:—“you are naughty boys, and deserve to be punished\r\nfor thus hacking and carving each other; but, as paternal solicitude\r\nfor the happiness of our loving subjects is our ruling principle, we\r\nwill—_pension a surgeon to sew up your wounds_. There, now, be gone—but\r\nmind, young gentlemen! no _political_ discussion in your verbondungs!\r\nIf you are ever caught at _that_, perpetual incarceration will be your\r\nlot!” This is literally the fact. The state not only winks at this Gothic\r\nwar among the students, but pays a state surgeon for attending the\r\nwounded![26]\r\n\r\nThe parents of youths going to universities of all kinds, have some\r\nreason for anxiety—if they knew all:—but the VERBONDUNGS of Germany are a\r\ndisgrace to civilized Europe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBADEN-BADEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong almost the whole way from Wisbaden to Baden-Baden, we have Belgium\r\non our right, and Devonshire on our left. The road, which generally\r\nskirts the bases of the undulating hills to the eastward, has hardly\r\na rise or fall, the alluvial and fertile plain stretching away to the\r\nRhine, till the mountains of Alsace arrest the attention on the western\r\nbank of that river. The whole space between the hills and the river, was,\r\nindisputably, a lake, at some remote period, drained by the breaking down\r\nof some obstruction to the stream—probably in the vicinity of the present\r\nLurley-rocks.\r\n\r\nFive or six miles from Rastadt and the Rhine, embosomed in a narrow dell,\r\nand encircled by steep and wooded hills, lies the far-famed BADEN-BADEN.\r\nThe comparative localities of Wisbaden and this place, might be imagined\r\nby supposing the former to be a saucer, and the latter an egg-cup. And\r\nyet the air of Baden, though in an egg-cup, is fresher if not purer, than\r\nthat of its celebrated rival of Nassau, where there are no eminences of\r\nany altitude within some miles of the town. It is true that the thermal\r\nsprings of Wisbaden are a few degrees higher in temperature than those of\r\nBaden, but this is quite insufficient to account for the difference of\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nA very few visits to the wells in the morning, the hells in the evening,\r\nand the hotels in the middle of the day, will convince any observant\r\ntraveller that three-fourths of the sojourners at Baden, go there to\r\ndrink wine rather than water—and to lose money, rather than regain health.\r\n\r\nThe thermal springs here are of great antiquity. They served to scour the\r\nRoman legions stationed at Baden, in the days of Aurelian, as they now\r\ndo to scald the pigs and poultry of the butchers and poulterers of the\r\nsame place. The far-famed Ursprung issues from the ruins of an old Roman\r\nstructure on the side of a hill overlooking the town, at a temperature\r\nof 154 degrees of Fahrenheit, and in quantities sufficient to wash and\r\ndrench the whole town, visitors and all. The water is translucid, and\r\ntastes much less either of the chickens or salt, than its contemporary of\r\nthe Kochbrunnen at Wisbaden. It has, however, especially in the baths,\r\na very faint odour of bear’s grease, or green fat, which I have noticed\r\nwhen speaking of the Kochbrunnen. The whole of the solid contents in\r\na pint of the water, are only about 24 grains, of which common salt\r\nmakes 16 grains, the other ingredients being chiefly lime, in different\r\ncombinations with sulphuric, muriatic, and carbonic acids. There is just\r\niron enough for the chemists to swear by—but not for the drinkers to\r\ndistinguish by taste.\r\n\r\nWhatever may _have_ been the reputation of the Baden waters, taken\r\ninternally, I apprehend that their fame is not very great in the present\r\nday. On several successive mornings, between five and eight o’clock, at\r\nthe Ursprung, I never could muster more than 130 bibbers—many of whom\r\nappeared to have been attracted to the Paleotechnicon from curiosity\r\nrather than in search of health. Except occasionally a fashionable\r\nlady’s-maid, or governess, no English were seen at the spring. The waters\r\nbeing led, however, into all the principal hotels, where there are\r\nbaignoires in abundance, the number of bathers outstrip very considerably\r\nthe number of bibbers. Although the waters of Baden are neither so potent\r\nwhen drunk, nor so stimulant when bathed in, as those of Wisbaden and\r\nmany other places, yet they manage to do a fair proportion of the annual\r\nmischief occasioned by hot mineral springs in general. Thermal spas and\r\nquack doctors, indeed, have more good luck than usually falls to the lot\r\nof men and things. They completely reverse the order of events in the\r\nmoral world. Their good actions are graven on _brass_—their evil deeds\r\nare written in _water_. Unless some illustrious character receive his\r\nquietus in a hot bath—as the Duke of Nassau did at Kissengen—\r\n\r\n    “Abstulit clarum cita mors Achillem”—\r\n\r\nwe seldom hear a word about the inferior souls who are deprived of their\r\nterrestrial tenements by the boiling Kochbrunnen, Ursprung, or Sprudel.\r\nAnd, when a great man actually falls a sacrifice, sufficient mischief\r\nis done before his death, by his example and recommendation. It is well\r\nknown that the Duke of Nassau’s preference of the Kissengen waters to\r\nthose of his own Wisbaden, drew many illustrious patients to the former\r\nsprings, who would have been contented with the latter. That the hot\r\nmineral baths produce a powerful effect even in health, and still more\r\nin disease, we have ample proofs. We need only take the testimony of my\r\nfriend Dr. Granville himself, who will not be suspected of any prejudice\r\nor timidity in respect to these agents. “One of the first effects of the\r\nhot water bath at Baden (and I may say the same of Toplitz, Carlsbad,\r\nWisbaden, &c.) produced on me, was an almost irresistible inclination to\r\nfall asleep. To resist this is of the utmost consequence.” “The operation\r\nof bathing in water endowed with much power, from heat and other\r\ncircumstances, is not to be viewed lightly. Much mischief has arisen—nay,\r\nfatal results have followed, from its indiscriminate adoption. A rich\r\nmerchant, who, but a few hours before, had been noticed on the public\r\npromenade after dinner, on the day after our arrival, was found dead in a\r\nbath at 8 o’clock of the same evening. A lady was pointed out to me, who\r\nhad lost the use of her limbs after using three hot baths.”\r\n\r\nThe injurious effects of hot baths, even of common water, are daily\r\nwitnessed at home—and these agents are still more powerful abroad. Their\r\nphysiological effects on the normal or healthy constitution, as mentioned\r\nabove, by Dr. Granville, I certainly did not experience in my own\r\nperson; but this might be from the thickness of my skull, the hardness\r\nof my brain, or the weakness of my circulation. The sensations produced\r\nby these baths were always of the most pleasant kind, with far more\r\ndisposition to ruminate than to sleep. In these effects, indeed, consists\r\nmuch of the danger. There are few diseases, however unsuited for hot\r\nbathing, that do not appear to be soothed or mitigated, at first, by this\r\nagent—and this apparent relief throws the practitioner off his guard, and\r\nleads the patient to extol the remedy, and persevere in the hazardous\r\nexperiment, till the mischief actually occurs. There is, in truth, much\r\nless danger from improper drinking of mineral waters, than bathing in the\r\nsame. The stomach or other organs are pretty sure to give ample notice of\r\napproaching injury from the imprudent use of mineral waters internally\r\ntaken. Not so in the case of bathing. While the train of destruction is\r\npreparing—nay, at the moment when the match is applied to the train,\r\nthe victim is lulled into a fatal security, not only by the absence of\r\npainful feelings, but by the positive induction of sensations the most\r\npleasurable.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to reiterate the precautions already stated in other\r\nplaces, as to the use of warm and hot bathing here. Rheumatic, gouty,\r\nparalytic, and cutaneous affections are those which can reap much benefit\r\nfrom the URSPRUNG—and, in these cases, all inflammatory and congestive\r\nstates of the constitution, as well as of particular organs, should be\r\ncarefully removed, before the waters are used, either internally or\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to resuscitate ample testimonies, lay and professional,\r\nto the _miraculous_ efficacy of the BADEN springs, in all diseases,\r\ncurable and incurable. An attendance among the fragments of antiquity\r\nround the Ursprung must convince the most credulous that BADEN, as I\r\nsaid before, is not the Pool of Bethesda, as far as its healing virtues\r\nare concerned, though its waters are daily “troubled” by angels somewhat\r\ndifferent from those that descended, for benevolent purposes, near the\r\nHoly City. BADEN is, in fine, neither more nor less than a fashionable\r\nplace of pleasure, dissipation, vice, and gambling—abounding in\r\nhot-baths, hells, hotels, scandal, and good scenery.\r\n\r\nThe last item in the above list has been most grossly exaggerated, as any\r\none will acknowledge who has visited the place and compared its scenery\r\nwith the following bombast.\r\n\r\n“The surpassing _grandeur_ of the scenery has been so constantly dwelt\r\nupon, that the hopeless task of description is unnecessary. Should you\r\nlove all that is _awful_, sombre, wild, and _grand_ in scenery, wander\r\nbut _half a mile_ from town, and you may be lost amid the dark valleys\r\nthat wind through the pine-covered mountains.”—_Mrs. Trollope._\r\n\r\nNow I most positively deny that there is anything either grand, or awful,\r\nor sublime, in the scenery of Baden. The valley is picturesque, romantic,\r\nor even beautiful—and the view from the ruins of the old castle (rather\r\nmore than half-a-mile, by the way, from the town) is extensive and very\r\nfine; but the sublime and the awful do not enter into the composition of\r\nBaden scenery. You must wander among the Alps for these.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES\r\n\r\n_Written at the VIEUX CHATEAU, August, 1834._\r\n\r\n    The pine-clad mountains boldly rise\r\n      Round BADEN’S hot and healing spring;\r\n    And cloudless are the azure skies,\r\n      With HEALTH on every Zephyr’s wing.\r\n\r\n    But ah! in this romantic dell,\r\n      Where streams of life for ever flow,\r\n    The demons of destruction dwell,\r\n      With VICE, the harbinger of woe!\r\n\r\n    That horrid thirst of other’s gold—\r\n      Those hell-born passions pent within,\r\n    Corrupt alike the young and old,\r\n      For “sin doth always pluck on sin!”—\r\n\r\n    At tables piled with many a heap\r\n      Of ore from Earth’s dark entrails torn,[27]\r\n    The harpy brood their vigils keep\r\n      From dewy eve till rosy morn.\r\n\r\n    Hither the pamper’d landlords hie—\r\n      While shivering tenants pine for bread—\r\n    Transform’d to brutes in Circe’s stye,\r\n      To every Christian precept dead!\r\n\r\n    The prince, the peasant, and the peer,\r\n      The soldier, cit, and baron bold,\r\n    On equal terms assemble here—\r\n      The race is not for rank—but gold!\r\n\r\n    And whilst the whirling ball flies round,\r\n      In dread suspense the gamester stands—\r\n    It drops—and quick each shining mound\r\n      Dissolves—and shifts to other hands.\r\n\r\n    Shall Albion’s sons and daughters roam\r\n      To Baden’s fonts for “change of air,”\r\n    And bring these foreign vices home—\r\n      Abhorr’d—endured—but _practis’d_ there![28]\r\n\r\n    Haste then, my friend, from scenes like these—\r\n      And scale the mountain’s airy height—\r\n    Inhale the morning’s balmy breeze,\r\n      And contemplate the landscape bright:—\r\n\r\n    That glorious view of hills and dales—\r\n      Of fertile plains and winding Rhine—\r\n    Of forests vast—romantic vales—\r\n      And slopes that “teem with corn and wine.”\r\n\r\n    Or hie thee to the healing wave,\r\n      By Heaven to suffering mortals sent—\r\n    The cold and palsied limbs to lave,\r\n      Or soothe the joints with torture rent.—\r\n\r\n    But ye, whom HEALTH, or pleasure calls,\r\n      To seek that prize in distant lands,\r\n    Avoid, as ye would death, those halls,\r\n      Where dwell the DÆMON-ROBBER bands!\r\n\r\nLest I should be suspected of taking a cynical view of Baden-Baden, I\r\nshall adduce the following quotations from Dr. Granville.\r\n\r\n“Here men, as well as women, took their places at, or stood round,\r\nthe several tables of “ROULETTE” and “ROUGE-ET-NOIR,” which were in\r\nfull play. One only remark I will venture to make in reference to\r\nthis subject—and that remark will be an expression of deep sorrow, at\r\nhaving observed the daughters of Englishmen, to all appearance highly\r\nrespectable, joining the circle of such as pressed round the tables, to\r\nstake their _petite pieces_, and be elbowed by some rude fellow-gambler,\r\nwho had probably as little character as he had money to lose.”\r\n\r\nI am happy to say that in the interval between 1834 and 1839, when I\r\nlast visited Baden, some improvement seemed to have taken place in this\r\nrespect, especially among our fair countrywomen. I saw very few of them\r\nin the act of gambling, but the sight of such scenes—during the whole of\r\nthe Sabbath day—is most injurious to our youth of both sexes! I cannot\r\nsay so much for the balls in the evening. They are the same now as when\r\nDr. Granville wrote.\r\n\r\n“Away whirled the galoppe-dancers in giddy circles, until the very\r\nbreathing of the fair partners became audible, and their countenances\r\nlost all traces of placid loveliness. And the rude grasp and _étroite\r\nliaison_, during such dances—do they become the modest nature of\r\nan Englishwoman—or of any woman? Oh, it grieved me to see the\r\ngraceful—elancé—and exquisitely elegant Mrs. M——, at the slightest\r\ninvitation from a booted hussar, or an embroidered _attaché_, or a\r\ndisguised _vaurien_ of the lowest class, plunge with them into all the\r\nattitudes, now violent, and now languishing, of a dance better suited for\r\nbacchanalian or Andalusian representation! And she bore on her alabaster\r\nand shining cheek, the deep round flush of consumption, which parched\r\nher lips, and made her fly, at the termination of each performance, to\r\nthe refreshment-room with her partner—there to quench, with perilous\r\nexperiment, the inward fever, by an ice dissolved in freezing water;\r\nwhile the big drops of moisture stood on her forehead, or trickled down\r\nher face, increasing the general disorder of her appearance.”\r\n\r\nYes! The ROULETTE and the WALTZ are the veritable “normal schools of\r\n_agitation_” for the sons and daughters of the nobility and gentry of\r\nthe—happy, pious, and Protestant England!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILDBAD, OR THE ELYSIAN FOUNTAIN OF THE BLACK FOREST.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe glowing description of this mineral spring, and the all but magical\r\neffects of its baths on the human frame, as given by Dr. Granville,\r\nhave led hundreds of additional visitors to the sequestered valley of\r\nthe Enz—some in quest of health, but many to satisfy curiosity, and\r\ntest the picture which has been drawn in such flattering colours by the\r\ntalented author of the “SPAS OF GERMANY.” The difficulties, however,\r\nwhich Dr. Granville experienced in his journey from Baden-Baden to\r\nWildbad, must have deterred a great number of spa-tourists from visiting\r\nthe Elysian fountain of the Black Forest. The journey occupied thirty\r\nhours, including one whole night on the road. We accomplished it in eight\r\nhours, by an excellent road, with the same pair of horses, and with ample\r\nleisure to lunch and rest midway. This route lies through some of the\r\nmost beautiful, picturesque, and romantic scenery on the Continent. It is\r\nonly thirty English miles, six or seven of which Dr. Granville pursued,\r\nwhen by some strange intelligence or mistake, he turned to the _right_,\r\nat Guernsbach, and went _wrong_ all the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nSick of the frivolities and dissipations of Baden-Baden, we started at\r\neight o’clock in the morning for Wildbad; and, wending our course up a\r\nsteep acclivity, everywhere covered with pines, we passed the _Mercurius\r\nBerg_, with its altar dedicated to the god of thieves—\r\n\r\n    “Calidum quicquid placuit jocoso\r\n                      condere furto”—\r\n\r\njust as the Romans had left it, together with the frowning ruins of\r\nEberstein, where thievery rose to the rank of robbery, and was christened\r\nunder the high-sounding title of FEUDALISM! The higher we ascended, the\r\ndenser became the woods, and the darker the road. There is something\r\npeculiarly sombre and solemn in the pineries of the Schwartswald, through\r\nmany parts of which I had formerly journeyed. The vast extent of the\r\nforest, the great number and altitude of the hills and mountains, the\r\ngigantic growth and height of the trees, the darkness of the foliage, and\r\nthe intensity of the silence, occasionally augmented rather than broken\r\nby the distant and scarcely audible stroke of the woodman’s axe, all\r\ncombine to form a scene of solitude well adapted for contemplation and\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour’s labour, we gained an open space, when the eye has an\r\nopportunity of ranging over a sea of peaks and mountains to the South and\r\nEast, all clothed in the dark green livery of the pine to their utmost\r\nsummits. To the North and West the prospect was nearly as unlimited as\r\nfrom the Alte-Schloss, from Radstad and the Rhine up the valley of the\r\nMourg to Guernsbach, which seemed like a white speck on the river at a\r\nprodigious depth below us. Down to this little town we cautiously slid,\r\nwith drags on the wheels, winding in serpentine courses, often along the\r\nbrinks of dangerous ravines, but every little vale or valley cultivated\r\ntill the forest forbad the plough, the spade, and the scythe. The little\r\ntown of Guernsbach, built on both sides of the Mourg, with a good bridge\r\nacross, contains nearly two thousand inhabitants—almost all of whom\r\nlive _by_ the produce of the mountains, and a good number of the poorer\r\nclasses _in_ the woods themselves. Here the raftlets and rafts are seen\r\ndescending to the Rhine, afterwards to aggregate into flotillas carrying\r\nhundreds of rowers, steerers, and navigators,—and conveying the Black\r\nForest into the flats of Holland. But a little farther on, I shall take\r\nmore notice of this immense traffic and source of wealth. The Castle\r\nof Eberstein and the church crown the heights over the town. Here Dr.\r\nGranville, instead of crossing the bridge, turned up along the banks of\r\nthe Mourg, and had to go all the way to Stuttgardt, on his way to Wildbad.\r\n\r\nFrom Guernsbach we ascended another lofty mountain to the romantic\r\nvillage of Laffenau. The prospect of the valley of the Mourg, with\r\nGuernsbach on its banks, and a sea of pine-clad heights in every\r\ndirection, is most beautiful. Near Laffenau we have the “TEUFELS MUHLE,”\r\nor Devil’s Mill, with its legendary tale—briefly as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe PRINCE OF DARKNESS took it into his head, once on a time, to turn\r\nparson, and to preach from a chair or pulpit, still called by the name\r\nof that right reverend divine. His audience became more numerous than\r\nenlightened, when an angel, from quite a different quarter, pitched his\r\ntent on a neighbouring peak, and held forth in opposition to the man in\r\nblack. The eloquence of the new preacher drew away great numbers from\r\nthe old. Satan, in hopes of disturbing the congregation of his rival,\r\nvented his rage in some caverns in the rock, and in growls and groans\r\nthat resembled thunder. But still the audience of the new preacher\r\nmultiplied. This was more than any preacher, human or divine, could bear;\r\nand the old gentleman forthwith built himself a mill, the noise of which,\r\ntogether with the _diabolical_ hootings, yells, and howlings of the\r\nmiller and his men, he hoped would distract the audience of the orthodox\r\necclesiastic. Even this would not do, and his reverence of the cloven\r\nfoot and long tail betook himself from words to things. He hurled masses\r\nof rock across the valley against the successful candidate for popular\r\napplause, with as much ease as a man would pitch quoits. This was “too\r\nbad;” and therefore a bolt from Heaven was directed against this teacher\r\nof impieties which demolished the mill, and prostrated the miller and his\r\ncrew amongst the ruins! The disturber of the peace fell with such force\r\namong the rocks that the print of his body remains evident to the present\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n    The tale may be false, or the tale may be true,\r\n    As I heard it myself, I relate it to you.\r\n\r\nThe legend concludes with one piece of intelligence, to the truth of\r\nwhich most people will assent: namely, that after the above event, the\r\narch enemy has seldom ventured to hold forth from the pulpit, _in propria\r\npersona_, but has employed a great number of emissaries in human shape,\r\nwho disseminate among mankind, and some of them _ex cathedra_, too, those\r\n“false doctrines, heresies, and schisms,” which scandalize the church and\r\ncause dissensions among the people.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few miles, the whole route from Baden-Baden to\r\nNuenburg, is a series of steep mountains and narrow valleys, presenting\r\nthe greatest variety of scenery, from the picturesque and beautiful, up\r\nto the romantic, wild, and savage character. A thunder-storm, with heavy\r\nrain the preceding night—and now a beautiful day, with brilliant sun,\r\ngave us every advantage; while the mountain air, with active and passive\r\nexercise in alternation, produced, at once, sensations of health and\r\nhunger, so little felt in the close and deep valley of dissipation which\r\nwe had left behind us at Baden.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHWEIN-GENERAL.\r\n\r\nIt was on the summit of a lofty mountain between Laffenau and Herrenalb,\r\nthat we fell in with one of those generals, or, I should rather say,\r\n_field_-marshals, (immortalized by the “Old Man of the Brunnens”)\r\nwho, with three or four aid-de-camps, was marching and manœuvering a\r\n“swinish multitude” of raw recruits among these alpine heights. They were\r\nevidently less a fighting than a foraging party, levying contributions\r\non every thing edible in these sombre pineries. It was also manifest\r\nthat, whether from the morning air or the supperless night, they were\r\nby no means over nice, either in their olfactory or gustatory senses;\r\nfor nothing seemed to come amiss to them, or to prove unsavoury or\r\nindigestible. But although provender turned up at almost every step,\r\nthey were a grumbling and grunting, as well as an awkward squad, and so\r\nprone to predatory excursions, that the schwein-general and his staff\r\nwere constantly flogging them into the regular ranks. Their long legs\r\nand lank sides shewed that their fare was not of the most fattening\r\nnature—or, that they had little else than predatory rations to live\r\nupon. They had been called out early that morning, by bugle and horn,\r\nfrom their various bivouacs in Laffenau, with more appetite than order,\r\nfor their mountain drill. The general (or field-marshal) with his\r\naid-de-camps, and some vigilant videttes, of the canine species, had no\r\nsmall difficulty in compelling their guerilla corps of maurauders to keep\r\n“close order;” for they were constantly deploying to the right and to the\r\nleft—shooting a-head—or straggling in the rear, despite the proclamations\r\nof the general, the stripes of the subalterns, and the biting rebuffs of\r\nthe quadrupeds, who, ever and anon, _lugged_ back into the ranks some\r\nlong-faced and bleeding deserter, amid the grunts and groans of his\r\nsympathising companions, on whom, however, these summary sentences of a\r\ndrum-head, or rather mountain-head, court-martial appeared to make but a\r\ntransient impression.\r\n\r\nOn taking leave of General Swein, I could not help making some “odious\r\ncomparisons” between him and some other generals, “_melioris notæ_,” in\r\nvarious parts, and at various epochs of this world. HE did not, like too\r\nmany of his order, lay villages in ashes, and massacre the inhabitants\r\nwhen rushing from the flames—or deliver their wives and daughters to the\r\ntender mercies of an enfuriate soldiery—HE did not murder his prisoners\r\nin cool blood, by nailing them to trees, as marks for an undisciplined\r\nrabble of fanatic banditti to exercise their muskets—HE did not drag\r\ncitizens of a free state from their homes, and consign them to the\r\nmines and wilds of Hyperborean regions—HE did not mock the forms of\r\nHEAVENLY justice, and slaughter the victims of his ambition or revenge\r\nin the fosse or on the glacis—HE did not turn the fertile district into\r\na frightful desert, as the effectual means of ensuring peace—(“ubi\r\nsolitudinem faciunt, pacem vocant”)—HE did not perform these or any\r\nsimilar exploits, and, _therefore_, he has had no pious advocate to\r\njustify his crimes, or impartial historian to record his virtues!\r\n\r\nDescending by a long and zig-zag road from the Swine-General’s camp,\r\nwe arrive at HERRENALB, situated in a romantic glen, enclosed by lofty\r\nmountains. Here we lunched, and rested our horses, who certainly had\r\nbetter fare than their masters. Black bread, bad butter, hard eggs, and\r\nchopped hay for tea, were devoured without grumbling, in consequence of\r\nthe canine appetite acquired on the alpine heights. On leaving Herrenalb,\r\nwe pass on our left, one of the most singular and fantastic groups of\r\nbasaltic rocks which I have anywhere seen. They appear like a gigantic\r\nfortress, with buttresses and embrasures. A traveller has remarked\r\nof these productions of subterranean fire, that—“on croirait qu’une\r\nimagination fantastique a presidé a leur formation.” They probably issued\r\nfrom a deep-seated volcano, in the form of molten lava, at the time when\r\nStaffa and the Giant’s Causeway rose from the bowels of the earth, and\r\ncongealed in pillars on the shores of Antrim and Argyll.\r\n\r\n    “Firm on its rocky base each pillar stands—\r\n    No chissel’d shaft, no work of mortal hands.\r\n    Ere man had ceased in savage woods to dwell—\r\n    Roots for his food, his drink the crystal well;\r\n    Ere cities grew, or Parian marble shown,\r\n    Yon columns stood—and stand while they are gone.”\r\n\r\nFrom these “fragments of an earlier world,” these real monuments of\r\nantiquity, compared with which, the Pyramids of Egypt are as mushrooms of\r\nyesterday, and whose rugged brows the rains and tempests of ten thousand\r\nyears have not yet smoothed, we ascended to a great height, and reached\r\na comparatively open and partially cultivated country, between FRAUENALB\r\non the left, and ROTHENSAL on the right. This alpine plateau continued\r\nfor six or seven miles—the prospect towards the North and West being of\r\ngreat extent, over a fine champaigne country which, from this altitude,\r\nappeared like an immense plain. The South and East presented a vast\r\nsea of mighty mountains, the insurgent billows of which were feathered\r\nwith perennial forests. After doubling the North-western extremity of\r\na high alpine ridge, we turned short round to the right—plunged into a\r\ndeep wood—and descended quickly by a precipitous route to the town of\r\nNUENBURG, situated on the foaming Enz, in a narrow and gloomy valley.\r\nHere we got black bread and water for the horses, and Seltzer water with\r\nwine for ourselves. While the horses were resting, we scrambled up to\r\nthe ancient chateau, now occupied by the foresters. From this there is a\r\ngood view of the valley of the Enz, for a few miles above and below the\r\ntown. The valley is here not more than five or six hundred yards broad at\r\nthe bottom, with the river in the centre, and the pine mountains rising\r\nabruptly on both sides. We had now about eight miles to Wildbad, close\r\nalong the right bank of the river, and consequently with only a gentle\r\nascent the whole way.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Wildbad, between Nuenburg and the town of Wildbad, is about\r\n1400 feet above the level of the sea—and the mountains on each side about\r\n1500 above the river. It resembles a good deal the _Vallée d’Enfer_, well\r\nknown to most travellers. There is but a narrow border of cultivated\r\nground on each side of the Enz—in some places not exceeding two or three\r\nhundred yards—in others, creeping up the steep acclivities nearly a\r\nquarter of a mile. Hay, corn, and potatoes are the chief productions of\r\nthe valley. The pine occupies every slope not cultivated; the forest, on\r\neach side, presenting a serrated border, the salient angles sometimes\r\ncoming nearly down to the banks of the stream—the interspaces being\r\noccupied with potatoes or some culinary vegetable. But the Enz itself\r\npresents more bustle and activity than its banks. Small and precipitous\r\nas is the torrent, it is made to carry the mountains—or at least their\r\nforests, on its slender back. The flotteurs or rafters are a race and\r\ncraft distinct from the wood-cutters, who hew the trees in the mountains,\r\nand hurl them down their steep sides to the river. The Enz falls 370\r\nfeet in the short distance of nine miles between Wildbad and Nuenburg,\r\nand yet they manage to float down numerous rafts, or rather raftlets,\r\ntwo or three hundred feet in length, along this trajet. The method is\r\nsimple but ingenious. At convenient distances, dikes or dams are run\r\ndiagonally across the stream, with a sluice or flood-gate in the centre.\r\nWhen the gate is shut, the back-water accumulates so as to float the raft\r\nfrom the next dam higher up. The rafts are narrow, but very long and\r\njointed. When one, two, or more have arrived at the dam, the head of the\r\nraft is brought close to the sluice—the gate is opened—and away darts\r\nthe raft, with a loud noise and fracas—dashing against the rocks—each\r\njoint, as it passes over the dam, rising up like the dorsal fin of a huge\r\nwhale rolling about in the sea. In this way they are conveyed from the\r\nmountains to the Rhine—the raftlets augmenting in breadth, or number of\r\ntrees, in proportion as the stream augments and enlarges into a river. As\r\nevery mountain must have a valley, so every valley must have a rivulet.\r\nHowever small the stream, it can be dammed so as to float one tree at\r\na time—and when contributary streamlets from the mountains enlarge the\r\nparent stream, the raftlets increase in size also. Thus the main wealth\r\nof Wildbad is constantly floating down the Enz, consigned to distant\r\ncountries, but leaving profit for the merchant, and affording employment\r\nfor thousands and thousands of the industrious poor. The raftlets grown\r\ninto rafts, having arrived at the Rhine, change hands, and the local\r\nboucherons, or floaters, return to their native valleys to renew their\r\nlabours from spring till the approach of winter. The aggregated rafts now\r\nbecome FLOTILLAS, capable of bearing an army on their backs, and actually\r\ninhabited by four or five hundred—not seamen but raftmen, while they\r\nglide down the majestic stream of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nLet us see whether this animated scene of industry, hilarity, and wealth\r\nhas any back-ground to the picture—any alloy to the pure metal. Many a\r\ngaudy tissue, embroidered robe, and sparkling gem, has been produced by\r\nsordid hands, amidst penury, disease, and despair! The wood-cutter of\r\nthe Black Forest mountains leads a gloomy and miserable life. His labour\r\nis eternally the same—affording no food or reflection for the mind—the\r\nworkmen being secluded in dark and dreary forests for days, weeks, and\r\nmonths, without any communication with their families; while their\r\nchildren are entirely neglected, as far as education is concerned! They\r\nare, as it were, cut off from human society—become morose, taciturn,\r\nmelancholic—or even misanthropic. What is worse, they are frequently\r\nbrought home maimed, lamed, or stricken with some dangerous or fatal\r\ndisease! They almost always die prematurely. Yet the facility of gaining\r\na livelihood by cutting and floating wood, leaves very few inhabitants\r\nof this valley inclined to pursue any mechanical occupation. The trees,\r\nwhen felled and the branches lopped off, are dragged in traineaus to the\r\nedges of the declivities, from whence they descend along cleared tracks,\r\nor a kind of wooden tunnel, by their own weight, to the vicinity of the\r\nriver. A little field of potatoes—a wooden hut—a couple of goats to feed\r\nthe children—and a pig to be killed at Christmas—constitute the whole\r\nriches of the woodman, whether of mountain or valley.\r\n\r\nAfter a very pleasant drive of nine miles along the right bank of the\r\nEnz, we came suddenly upon the little town of Wildbad, now celebrated for\r\nthe divine effects of its baths on the human frame. The town contains 279\r\ninhabited houses, and 115 buildings of other kinds. It is nearly equally\r\ndivided by the foaming little Enz, the backs of houses, on each side of\r\nthe valley, being actually built against the feet of the mountains. As\r\nthese are some 1500 feet high, an hour, at least, of the rising, and\r\nanother of the setting sun, are unseen and unfelt in Wildbad—except in\r\nthe curious phenomenon of the sunshine creeping down the western mountain\r\nin the morning, and up the eastern mountain in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Wildbad lies nearly North and South, and consequently the\r\nwinds are felt only in those two directions. The temperature of the\r\natmosphere necessarily varies considerably, but cold prevails over heat.\r\nSnow ordinarily lurks on the summits of the mountains from the middle\r\nof November till the middle of May. From the first of July till the\r\nmiddle of August, the heat is generally great. “In a hot summer (says\r\nProfessor Heim) the temperature is almost insupportable about mid-day,\r\nwhen the breeze is scarcely perceptible in the depth of the valley.” In\r\nJune, July, and August, the thermometer in Wildbad mounts occasionally to\r\n90, in the hottest days—and falls correspondingly in the winter. In the\r\nseason (months of June, July, August, and September) of 1834, there were\r\n47 clear days—five thunder-storms—and 34 rainy days. In 1837—35 clear\r\ndays—44 rainy days—and 11 thunder-storms. During the years 1834-5-6 and\r\n7, the mean temperature of the four summer months, at mid-day, was 66° of\r\nFahrenheit, which is very moderate. Lightning has never struck any of the\r\nhouses in Wildbad—the contiguous mountains proving excellent conductors.\r\nThere are no peculiar diseases at Wildbad, except those produced by\r\nscanty food and hard labour. Scarcely any goitres or cretins are seen\r\nhere. The inhabitants hardly ever take any other medicines than the warm\r\nwaters of the place. Doctors would inevitably starve here, were it not\r\nfor the foreign visitors. The water of Wildbad is excellent, both for\r\ncooking and drinking. Pulmonary complaints are exceedingly rare in this\r\nvalley, and indeed in the Black Forest generally. The same may be said of\r\ngoitre and cretinism.\r\n\r\nWe took up our quarters at the BEAR, exactly opposite the baths, and had\r\nno reason to complain of our accommodations in this hotel. My chamber\r\nwas in the back of the house, just over the noisy little Enz; but its\r\nmurmurings only lulled me to a sound sleep, after the keen mountain air,\r\nand the healthy exercise of the day.\r\n\r\nIt is only within these few years that Wildbad has become much known,\r\nthrough the writings of Drs. Flicker and Granville. Professor Heim has\r\nnow added to the means of its publicity. In 1830, the number of bathers\r\nwas 470—in 1837, 1,003—in 1838, the number was 1,235. In this list, the\r\nreal bathers and drinkers only are inscribed. The mere passengers of a\r\nday or two are omitted. In 1837, there were only ten English, who used\r\nthe waters. In 1838, there were 130. In 1839, about the middle of August,\r\nwhen I was there, the number had still encreased. The accommodations\r\nhitherto have been insufficient. In this year, 1840, a new and grand\r\nedifice will be completed, capable of contributing to the comfort—would\r\nthat it may not add to the gambling luxury or destruction of—a large\r\nnumber of visitors! The PALACE, which is close to the baths, is open to\r\nthe public—in fact, it is a hotel, for the refreshment of body and mind.\r\nIt would be unjust, not to commemorate here the wise, salutary, and\r\nbeneficent injunction against GAMBLING, which is rigorously enforced by\r\nthe government. May it continue in force, _per omnia secula seculorum_!\r\n\r\nThe warm baths of Wildbad issue from several sources in the granite\r\nrock; but are collected into four basins, isolated from each other, and\r\nunder particular regulations. Just opposite the Bear Hotel is the place\r\nfor drinking the waters, a few feet below the surface of the square\r\nor market-place. There are two spouts, and I observed for two hours\r\nthe devotees of this Hygeian spring. I should have little hesitation\r\nin swearing that there was not a single malingerer (to use a military\r\nphrase for one who _feigns_ disease,) in the whole group, amounting to\r\nabout sixty or eighty. They all bore intrinsic marks of indisposition;\r\nbut the maimed, the lame, the paralytic, and the rheumatic, constituted\r\nnine-tenths of the assemblage. I had an early note from Professor Heim,\r\npolitely offering to shew me the baths. With him I proceeded to the\r\nFURSTENBAD, or Prince’s Bath, in which Dr. Granville bathed. On entering\r\nthe BAD, I found it occupied by two persons—one quite naked, the other\r\nwith white drawers on—while Dr. Fricker, who stood on the steps with\r\na watch in his hand, was directing the operations. I naturally shrunk\r\nback, with an apology for intruding; but my kind and honest friend, Dr.\r\nHeim, pushed me forward, observing, that there was “no offence.” The\r\nbather was a Russian General, Comte ——, and he who sat behind him in the\r\nbath, rubbing his back, was the bad-meister. I entered into conversation\r\nwith the General and his medical director, and found them agreeable,\r\nintelligent, and frank communicants. The douche having been applied, and\r\nthe bathing process finished, I withdrew for a quarter of an hour, while\r\nthe bath was preparing for myself. Most of my readers must have read or\r\nheard of these celebrated waters by Dr. Granville, and I must here record\r\nhis account of the surprising sensations which they produce on the human\r\nframe immersed in them.\r\n\r\n“After descending a few steps from the dressing-room into the bath-room,\r\nI walked over the warm soft sand to the farthest end of the bath, and I\r\nlaid myself down upon it, near the principal spring, resting my head on\r\na clean wooden pillow. The soothing effect of the water as it came over\r\nme, up to the throat, transparent like the brightest gem or aquamarine,\r\nsoft, genially warm, and gently murmuring, I shall never forget. Millions\r\nof bubbles of gas rose from the sand, and played around me, quivering\r\nthrough the lucid water as they ascended, and bursting at the surface to\r\nbe succeeded by others. The sensation produced by these, as many of them,\r\nwith their tremulous motion, just _effleuraient_ the surface of the body,\r\nlike the much vaunted effect of titillation in animal magnetism, is not\r\nto be described. _It partakes of tranquillity and exhilaration; of the\r\necstatic state of a devotee, blended with the repose of an opium eater.\r\nThe head is calm, the heart is calm, every sense is calm; yet there is\r\nneither drowsiness, stupefaction, nor numbness; for every feeling is\r\nfresher, and the memory of worldly pleasures keen and sharp._ But the\r\noperations of the moral as well as physical man are under the spell of\r\nsome powerfully tranquillising agent. It is the human tempest lulled\r\ninto all the delicious playings of the ocean’s after-waves. From such a\r\nposition I willingly would never have stirred. To prolong its delicious\r\neffects what would I not have given! but the bad-meister appeared at the\r\ntop of the steps of the farther door, and warned me to eschew the danger\r\nof my situation; for there is danger even in such pleasures as these, if\r\ngreatly prolonged.\r\n\r\n“I looked at the watch and the thermometer before I quitted my station.\r\nThe one told me I had passed a whole hour, in the few minutes I had\r\nspent according to my imagination; and the other marked 29½° of Reaumur,\r\nor 98¼° of Fahrenheit. But I found the temperature warmer than that,\r\nwhenever, with my hand, I dug into the bed of sand, as far down as the\r\nrock, and disengaged myriads of bubbles of heated air, which imparted to\r\nthe skin a satiny softness not to be observed in the effects of ordinary\r\nwarm baths.\r\n\r\n“These baths are principally used from five o’clock in the morning until\r\nseven, and even much later; and again by some people in the evening.\r\nThe time allowed for remaining in the water is from half an hour to an\r\nhour; but it is held to be imprudent to continue the bath to the latter\r\nperiod, as experience has shown that such sensations as I felt, and\r\nhave endeavoured to describe, prove ultimately too overpowering to the\r\nconstitution, if prolonged to excess.”[29]\r\n\r\nDr. Kerner, who preceded Dr. Granville, makes use of the following\r\nexpressions, quoted by the latter author.\r\n\r\n“The use of the Wildbad waters cannot be too much commended. They serve,\r\nindeed, _to make the old young again_; while younger persons, who have\r\nbecome prematurely old, owing to exhaustion, and those who are exhausted\r\nby close application and incessant fatigue, _rise out of these baths with\r\nnew strength and youth_.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I called to mind these identical expressions, as applied\r\nby Dr. Fenner to the Serpent’s Bath at Schlangenbad, and remembered\r\nalso my disappointment; yet I could not divest myself of the pleasing\r\nanticipations that Wildbad would realize the effects recorded by my\r\nfriend Dr. Granville, and that I should retreat from this romantic valley\r\nat least ten years younger than when I entered it. I dispensed with the\r\nattendance of the bad-meister—locked the door—descended into the bath—and\r\ncreeping to the identical spot where Dr. Granville experienced the\r\n“ecstatic state of a devotee, blended with the repose of an opium-eater,”\r\nI waited, not without some impatience, the advent of this fore-taste of\r\nParadise. But no such good fortune awaited me! I eyed the gas bubbles\r\nthat rose around me, not indeed “in millions,” nor even in dozens—but\r\nso sparingly that I could have easily numbered them, eager though they\r\nhad been to “quiver through the lucid water” in their ascent to greet\r\nmy friend and confrere a few years previously. With every wish to be\r\npleased, and with the most minute attention to my own sensations, I must\r\nconfess that I experienced no effects from the waters of Wildbad, other\r\nthan I did from baths of similar temperature and composition, as those\r\nof Schlangenbad, Baden, and Pfeffers.[30] They have the same advantage\r\nas the Pfeffers, in maintaining the same temperature, however long we\r\nmay remain in them—the stream running in and out of the baths. Whether\r\nthis may not sometimes tempt the bad-meisters to save the trouble and\r\ntime of emptying the baths after each bather, I do not profess to know.\r\nWith respect to the bed of warm sand at the bottom, I think it is more\r\npleasant to the feelings than to the imagination. It is impossible that\r\n_it_ can be changed; and the idea of lying down in a bed which a leper\r\nmay have just left, is not the most pleasant in the world. For myself, I\r\nshould prefer the clean marble, or even the wood to this substratum of\r\nsand. It is but justice to state, that there is a rule for all persons\r\nto go through the quarantine of a plain bath before commencing the\r\nmedicinal. Such a rule, however, was not imposed upon me—nor I believe,\r\non the generality of casual bathers. I stayed in the bath half an hour,\r\nand felt exceedingly refreshed by it. I have no hesitation, therefore,\r\nin giving it as my opinion that the waters of Wildbad are inferior to\r\nnone, in their medicinal agency, as baths of a non-stimulant and simple\r\nkind. Their improper use is not nearly so hazardous as those of Wisbaden,\r\nKissengen, or Carlsbad, whose saline ingredients act powerfully on the\r\nsentient extremities of the nerves of the skin, and too often excite\r\ndangerous commotions in the animal economy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the day I fell in with my bath acquaintance, Count ——,\r\nthe Russian General, and had a long conversation with him. He had been in\r\nthe memorable campaign of 1812, and had, for some years, laboured under a\r\nparalytic affection of the lower extremities. He assured me that in four\r\nor five weeks of these baths and douches, he had regained a good deal of\r\npower in his limbs; but his general strength had decreased, and he was\r\nabout to repair to Schwalbach, in hopes that the chalybeate springs there\r\nwould invigorate his constitution. We had a polite invitation to a fête\r\nat the palace that evening, from the gallant General.[31]\r\n\r\nIn respect to the “bathing in company,” I confess I have a repugnance to\r\nit on many accounts, only one of which I shall state. The pleasure of\r\nconversation, in such places, is dearly purchased by the impossibility,\r\n(for the bather must go in a light dress,) of employing friction and\r\nshampooing on the naked surface—one of the greatest luxuries and salutary\r\nprocesses that can possibly be practised in warm-baths of any kind. This\r\nobjection alone is entirely fatal to the “community of bathing,” laying\r\naside the indelicacy of the thing.[32]\r\n\r\nThe douches are easily and simply performed by a kind of pump and hose,\r\nby which the warm water is directed against any part of the body, and\r\nwith any degree of force. A new source was discovered last year, near\r\nthe Furstenbad, which will greatly extend the means of bathing singly.\r\nAlready the refuse waters from the baths are sufficient to turn a mill as\r\nthey run out from the baths to the Enz—the river never freezing in the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nIn chemical and physical properties, the waters of Wildbad closely\r\nresemble those of Pfeffers and Schlangenbad. They are clear and\r\nodourless; but have a mawkish taste. In a pint, Professor Sigwart found\r\n3½ grains of saline matters, of which nearly 2 grains were common\r\nsalt—half a grain of carbonate of soda—and nearly the same of sulphate\r\nof soda. The other ingredients are chips in porridge, if we except a\r\nmere trace of iron. When boiled, it disengages a very trifling quantity\r\nof carbonic acid gas. The air which bubbles up from the waters contains\r\n(according to Gaeger and Gaertner) five parts of carbonic acid—7 of\r\noxygen—and 88 of azote. Since that analysis, it has been found that\r\nthere is little or no oxygen in the air. The temperature varies in the\r\ndifferent sources from 88° to 99° of Fahrenheit. It is quite independent\r\nof summer, winter, storms, or calms.\r\n\r\nWhen waters, so simple as scarcely to differ from the purest spring used\r\nfor drink, produce medicinal effects, the cause is attributed to some\r\nmysterious power, incognizable by the senses and inimitable by human art.\r\n\r\n    Arcana Dei miraculis plena.\r\n\r\nProfessor Heim takes up the same hypothesis as others before him, and\r\nDr. Granville among the rest, that the caloric of mineral waters is of\r\na _specific_ kind, analogous to the vital heat of the body. “It is a\r\nheat incorporated with the water by a chemico-vital process.” “And as no\r\nexternal warmth can supply the body with _vital_ heat, so no artificially\r\ncreated temperature can be a real substitute for the natural heat of\r\nthermal springs.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature, then, of the Wildbad waters being that of the human\r\nblood, immersion in them produces but a slight sensation of heat, the\r\nsurface of our bodies being below that of our blood in temperature. The\r\nsensation is that of _comfort_—a word not to be more nearly translated\r\ninto French than by the term “_bien-être_.” Here Professor Heim quotes,\r\nof course, Dr. Granville’s description of the “ecstatic” feelings which\r\nhe experienced in these waters. He adds:—“But another circumstance which,\r\nmore than all the rest, conduces to this favourable impression, is the\r\n_dynamic combination_ (le lien dynamique) of the solid and gaseous\r\nelements—the spirit of the water—received from the hand of Nature, in the\r\nbowels of the earth. It is this general impression on the whole human\r\norganism, which effects the cure of divers sufferings and maladies, by\r\nawakening and reviving the vital powers enfeebled or prostrated—and thus\r\nrestoring activity to the circulation and to the nervous system, through\r\nwhich a reaction and energy is communicated to all the functions of the\r\nbody.”\r\n\r\nThese effects, Prof. Heim acknowledges, cannot be accounted for by the\r\nchemical composition of the water. The cosmetic qualities of Wildbad and\r\nSchlangenbad, he thinks, may be _partly_ owing to the soda contained in\r\nthem, which forms a kind of oily soap on the surface, and gives it that\r\nfeeling of lubricity and softness, so much vaunted: but he believes it to\r\nbe _principally_ owing to the peculiar power of the bath to invigorate\r\nthe functions of the skin as well as of the internal organs—a power\r\ngreater, he maintains, in the waters of Wildbad than of Schlangenbad.\r\n\r\nAlthough these waters generally produce an exciting or exhilarating\r\neffect, yet in a certain number of instances, they cause a sense of\r\nlassitude and heaviness in the extremities, with an inclination to\r\nsleep, especially after leaving the bath. These effects are commonly\r\nattributable to improper use of the baths, or staying too long in them,\r\nin consequence of the pleasant feelings derived from them. Dr. H.\r\nrecommends all persons to stay but 10 or 15 minutes in the bath at first,\r\ngradually increasing the time to half or three-quarters of an hour. In\r\nsome, the head is affected with vertigo—in others, there is oppression on\r\nthe chest—all which soon go off, after five or six baths.\r\n\r\n“It is to be remembered that a majority of the bathers experience the\r\n‘reaction fever’ (fièvre de réaction) in the course of the treatment.\r\nThe period of its occurrence is uncertain, and often it is so slight as\r\nto pass almost unobserved by the patient. This, however, is the critical\r\nmoment precursory of the cure. This state of irritation seldom lasts more\r\nthan a few days, and generally disappears without any internal medicine.\r\nThis reaction is precisely that which ought to inspire the greatest\r\nhopes in the patient, as it announces a change in his constitution, and\r\na victory over his malady. The disagreeable sensations, however, which\r\nhe feels, often puts him out of humour with the baths, especially if old\r\npains and discomforts, that had ceased, now re-appear, which they often\r\ndo. He becomes impatient and morose, when he is re-visited by rheumatic\r\npains, neuralgia, gout, hæmorrhoids, &c. which he had thought to be\r\nextinct. Such re-action, however, is indispensable towards the victory of\r\nnature and the baths over the disease for which they were employed. The\r\nwaters of Wildbad, indeed, are remarkable for this reproduction of old\r\ndisorders, at the moment they are eradicating the more recent ones.”\r\n\r\nThese most important properties of the waters of Wildbad are passed\r\nentirely unnoticed by Dr. Granville, and from my own knowledge, several\r\nEnglish have left Wildbad, at the very time they were on the point\r\nof experiencing the greatest benefits. This reaction or bath-fever,\r\nis common, as I have shewn, to most of the medicinal waters, as was\r\nseen under the head of Wisbaden, Kissengen, &c. At the former place I\r\nsaw several well-marked instances of it, and satisfied myself of its\r\nreality. I have not found any description of it in the accounts of\r\nthe German Spas published in England. It is a subject of the greatest\r\nimportance to the invalid.\r\n\r\nThe following case is related by Dr. KAISER, formerly director of these\r\nbaths. I have greatly abridged it.\r\n\r\n“An officer, aged 26 years, fell down a flight of stone stairs,\r\nand pitched on the right haunch, or hip-bone. He was stunned to\r\ninsensibility, from which he slowly recovered. When examined, the right\r\nleg and thigh were cold as ice, but no fracture or dislocation could be\r\ndiscovered. He was confined several weeks to his bed; and then could\r\nonly hobble about on crutches with great pain. At length he was able to\r\ndispense with the crutches, but every motion of the limb caused great\r\nagony. He tried the waters and baths of Wisbaden; but experienced no\r\nbenefit. Thirteen months after the accident, and when the excruciating\r\npains had rather gained than lost force, he came to Wildbad. The first\r\nbath produced no sensible effect. The second called forth some pains in\r\nthe loins, where he had felt no inconvenience previously. These augmented\r\nafter the third bath till the seventh, when they became so violent, that\r\nhe could not stand, and was confined to his bed. At this time he suddenly\r\nexperienced a most painful sense of coldness in the right foot, which was\r\nsucceeded by heat, reaction, and ultimately a profuse perspiration over\r\nthe whole limb, and even in the loins. From that time he was able to move\r\nthe leg without pain, and quickly regained the power of walking without a\r\nstick.”\r\n\r\nThe Wildbad baths are celebrated for the removal of those various pains\r\nand aches which not seldom attend old gunshot and other wounds. A case is\r\nrelated of an officer who had been wounded in the arm by a musket-ball in\r\nthe late war, and who was harassed by pains in the site of the wound for\r\nmany years afterwards. The use of the Wildbad baths re-opened the wound,\r\nfrom whence a piece of flannel was discharged, and the pains ceased.\r\n\r\nThese waters are considered to be specific in certain female complaints\r\nwhich are difficult of removal, and subversive of health, in too many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n“La proprieté de rajeunir, que les dames vantent tant dans le bain de\r\nWildbad, il faut moins la chercher dans sa vertu cosmetique, que dans la\r\ncirconstance que je viens de signaler.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be remarked that it is not in all persons that the re-action\r\nabove alluded to takes place. In many there is a gradual amelioration of\r\nhealth, without any perturbation of the constitution, and only marked by\r\nan encreased action in the functions of the skin and kidneys—sometimes of\r\nthe bowels.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, says Professor Heim, where the malady is obstinate,\r\nthere is a greater struggle in the constitution, attended with\r\nconsiderable fever, disorder of the secretions, irritation of the\r\nnervous system, full pulse, restless nights, distressing dreams, loss\r\nof appetite, dry hot skin, occasional hæmorrhoidal discharges, purging,\r\ngouty attacks, cutaneous eruptions, &c. which precede a restoration of\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\nThese are trials which require the fortitude of the patient, and the\r\nvigilance of the physician. It is not to be wondered at that, when they\r\noccur in the stranger, and especially in the English invalid, who has\r\nlittle confidence in the foreign practitioner, and finds himself ill in\r\na secluded valley like that of Wildbad, great alarm should be produced,\r\nand much prejudice raised against the baths and waters of the place.\r\nThe worst of it is, that a similar train of disorders may arise from an\r\ninjudicious use of the baths, and where no salutary crisis is the result.\r\n\r\n    Notre mal s’empoisonne\r\n    Du secours, qu’on lui donne!\r\n\r\nThese are circumstances which ought to be pointed out to our countrymen\r\nand women, who are too often led to distant mineral waters and baths\r\nby flowery descriptions and miraculous cures, without any warning as\r\nto the consequences that may ensue—whether salutary or dangerous. The\r\nconcealment of this spa or bath fever, is any thing but beneficial either\r\nto the waters or the water-drinkers. It deceives the one, and injures the\r\nreputation of the other. The local physicians of these mineral springs\r\nnever omit to point out the consequences of bathing in, and drinking the\r\nwaters, as I have already shewn by several quotations; and it is highly\r\ndesirable that all spa-goers should be aware of them.[33]\r\n\r\nCutaneous eruptions are frequent consequences of the Wildbad waters, and\r\nare considered salutary. The kidneys, next to the skin, shew the greatest\r\nsensibility to the action of these waters. In some people (especially\r\nwhere the waters are drunk as well as bathed in,) a most copious and\r\nclear secretion is produced; but this is seldom a critical or salutary\r\ndischarge. It is when the secretion from the kidneys is deep-coloured,\r\nsedimentous, and exhaling a peculiar odour, especially in gouty subjects,\r\nthat benefit may be confidently anticipated. The bowels are seldom\r\nacted on by these waters—more frequently, indeed, constipation is the\r\nresult, requiring aperient medicine both before and during the course.\r\nThe hæmorrhoidal and monthly periods are promoted by the waters, thus\r\nrelieving plethoric fulness of the abdominal organs.\r\n\r\n“In dispositions to rheumatism, cutaneous complaints, erysipelas,\r\ncatarrhal affections, neuralgia, chlorosis (green sickness,) tubercles,\r\nscrofula, difficult and premature accouchments, the waters of Wildbad\r\nare strongly recommended.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Heim warns the patient not to be discouraged, even if he leaves\r\nthe waters unrelieved, or worse than when he commenced the course. The\r\ncure will often follow, when the individual has regained his home, weeks\r\nor months after leaving Wildbad.\r\n\r\nIt is only since 1836, that a source of waters for drinking has been\r\ndiscovered and established at Wildbad. The mineral ingredients do not\r\nmaterially differ from those of the baths. They are now very generally\r\nused in conjunction with the latter, and are found to be very useful\r\nauxiliaries. They sit lightly on the stomach, and prove rather aperient\r\nthan otherwise. They increase the appetite, and promote materially the\r\naction of the skin, kidneys, and glandular organs generally.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISORDERS FOR WHICH THE WATERS OF WILDBAD ARE CHIEFLY USED.\r\n\r\nDr. Fricker has laid open to Professor Heim the records of 25 years’\r\nobservation and experience of these waters; from which, and also from his\r\nown practice, the latter physician has, in ten chapters, classified the\r\nmaladies for which the baths and waters have been employed, detailing\r\nnumerous cases, and superadding commentaries of his own. It will be\r\nnecessary to skim lightly over the heads of these chapters, in order\r\nto shew the properties of the Wildbad spa in its direct application to\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nI. _Rheumatism, Gout, and their Consequences._—“Our baths have always\r\nmaintained great reputation for the cure of these two classes of\r\ntormenting maladies, arising from different causes, but presenting many\r\ntraits of character in common.” The author cautions the bather against\r\nusing the baths, where there is any acute or even subacute inflammation\r\nin the joints, muscles, or internal organs. It is in the _chronic_ and\r\npainful forms of gout and rheumatism, together with their numerous\r\nconsequences, that the Wildbad waters will be found beneficial—indeed,\r\naccording to the authors abovementioned, almost infallibly curative.\r\nMessrs. Fricker and Heim trace many cases of tic, vertigo, deafness,\r\naffections of the sight, asthmatic coughs, intermissions of pulse,\r\ntracheal and bronchial affections, &c. to suppressed gout and rheumatism,\r\nas they are often removed by the baths and waters. Fifteen cases in\r\nillustration are detailed with great minuteness by Dr. Heim, to which the\r\nWildbad bather may refer on the spot.\r\n\r\nII. _Affections of the Spinal Marrow, and its Consequences,\r\nParalysis._—Diseases of the spinal marrow are seldom recognized in their\r\nearly stages, not indeed till symptoms of paralysis begin to shew\r\nthemselves in the limbs. This class of complaints is daily augmenting\r\nin number, as the baths of Wildbad can testify. These waters have, says\r\nM. Heim, often dissipated the symptoms which usually precede attacks of\r\nparalysis, and therefore, if used early, would be more useful than when\r\ntaken after the paralysis is actually developed. But even here, it is\r\naverred that the progress of the malady is frequently arrested, and an\r\namelioration procured.\r\n\r\nWhen the paralysis of the lower extremities is complete—when the\r\nindividual is no longer able to walk or stand, without assistance, the\r\nwaters of Wildbad have often produced wonderful effects in restoring\r\npower—indeed it is curious that, according to the physicians aforesaid,\r\nthese baths are frequently more successful in these cases than in those\r\nwhich are not so far advanced towards a complete paralysis. An immense\r\nnumber of cases are detailed by Dr. Heim under this head; and I am\r\ntempted to extract one, which is the case of a countryman of our own.\r\n\r\n“A young English gentleman, after bathing in a river, the water of which\r\nwas very cold, became completely paralytic of the lower extremities.\r\nHe came to Wildbad, and, without consulting any physician, commenced\r\nthe warmest of the baths. At the end of a fortnight he found himself so\r\nconsiderably improved, that he was able to lay aside his crutches, and\r\nwalk by the aid of a cane. At this time the coronation of our youthful\r\nqueen was announced, and the patient determined to assist at the\r\nceremony. He bore the journey well—and returned to Wildbad after a few\r\nweeks, without any relapse. He took a second course of the baths, and\r\nleft Wildbad ultimately in a very improved condition.”\r\n\r\nThose paralyses which affect one side only, are almost universally\r\nthe result of an apoplectic attack. “When these attacks have been\r\noccasioned by suppressed hæmorrhoidal discharges—eruptions of the skin\r\nsuddenly extinguished—engorgements or obstructions of the organs of\r\nthe abdomen—female obstructions at a certain period of life—metastases\r\nof gout or rheumatism—in such cases of hemiplegia, the Wildbad waters\r\nhave proved serviceable, and it is delightful to see so many of these\r\nparalytics leave Wildbad every season, with firm steps, although confined\r\nfor years previously to the couch, or crutches.”\r\n\r\nProfessor Heim wisely cautions those who have been of a plethoric\r\nconstitution, from too free an use of the baths, till they have\r\nascertained how they agree with their constitutions. Before any\r\namelioration takes place, the patient generally experiences some pricking\r\npains and tinglings in the paralyzed parts, followed by a sense of\r\nheat, perspiration, and increase of feeling. To these symptoms succeed\r\na gradual restoration of muscular power, accompanied by a sense of\r\nelectrical sparks passing along the nerves. Numerous cases of paralysis\r\nof one side are detailed by Dr. Heim.\r\n\r\nIII. and IV. These chapters are dedicated to paralysis occasioned by\r\npoisons—and also to cases of local paralyses of particular nerves—as\r\nthose of the face. I must pass them over. The waters appear to have been\r\nuseful in many of these instances.\r\n\r\nThe 5th Chapter relates to affections of the joints—to\r\nlumbago—sciatica—white swellings of the knee—contractions, &c., in which\r\nthe baths of Wildbad are lauded. One caution, however, is invariably\r\nenjoined—not to use the waters while there is any inflammation actually\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nThe SIXTH CHAPTER is on diseases of the bones, with numerous cases, which\r\nI shall pass over.\r\n\r\nThe SEVENTH CHAPTER treats of diseases of the skin,\r\ncured or relieved by the Wildbad baths and waters.\r\nHerpes—ringworm—prurigo—pityriasis—acne—inveterate itch—fetid\r\nperspirations, &c. &c. are said to be those which receive most advantage\r\nfrom these waters. Indeed I think it probable that the eulogiums are not\r\nmuch exaggerated as to this class of complaints.\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII. relates to scrofula and glandular affections generally. In\r\nsuch complaints it is of the greatest consequence to conjoin the internal\r\nwith the external use of the waters of Wildbad. These waters are much\r\nemployed by people with goitre, and Drs. Fricker and Heim consider them\r\nvery beneficial in enlargements of the liver, spleen, and even of the\r\nmesenteric glands.\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX. Wildbad appears to have attained some considerable reputation\r\nin female complaints. Next indeed in number to the class of lame and\r\nparalytic patients, which I saw around the baths and waters of this\r\nplace, were the chlorotic females, whose countenances exhibited the\r\n“green and yellow melancholy” of Shakespeare’s “love-sick” maiden—\r\n\r\n                    ——“She never told her love,\r\n    But let concealment, like a worm i’th’bud,\r\n    Feed on her damask cheek.”\r\n\r\nThere are more ailments than love-sickness, however, which cause the\r\nyouthful maid to “pine in thought,” and exchange all her lillies for\r\nthe pallid rose—the sparkling expression for the lack-lustre eye—and\r\nthe elasticity of youth for the languor of premature old age. For the\r\nirregularities and obstructions that generally lead to this chlorotic\r\nstate, the baths and waters of Wildbad are strongly recommended. Dr.\r\nHeim avers that, of late years, he has only failed in one instance to\r\nbring these females to a state of regularity and health—where no organic\r\ndisease existed. Although this is rather a startling assertion, yet the\r\nconcourse of female invalids to this place, bearing such unequivocal\r\nmarks of a particular class of ailments, offers a fair presumption that\r\nmany receive benefit there, else the numbers would diminish instead of\r\nincreasing from year to year. I can also easily believe that a course of\r\nthese baths, with the daily ingurgitation of large potions of a simple\r\ndiluent water, may remove many obstructions, and, at all events, bring\r\nthe constitution into that condition in which some good chalybeate, as\r\nSchwalbach, Spa, or Brockenau, might exert a powerful influence on the\r\nrestoration of health.\r\n\r\nThe new spring for drinking is at a temperature of 92°, and contains four\r\ngrains of saline substances in the pint, of which two are muriate of soda\r\nor common salt. It is used like other thermal waters, and is slightly\r\naperient, but chiefly alterative.\r\n\r\nThe public walks to the southward of the town, extend nearly a mile along\r\nthe noisy Enz, and are very pleasant. A contemplative philosopher might\r\nthere indulge his sublime speculations—the poet his “wayward fancies”—and\r\nthe devotee his celestial meditations, with little interruption.\r\n\r\nThe counter-indications, or disorders not benefited, but aggravated\r\nby the waters of Wildbad, are not materially different from those\r\nmentioned under the head of other thermal springs—as plethora, or\r\nfulness—tendency to apoplexy, to hæmorrhage of any kind, or to\r\nengorgements or inflammations of any of the internal organs. Neither are\r\nthey proper in cases of considerable debility. They are not to be used\r\nin inveterate catarrhal affections of the kidneys or bladder, attended\r\nwith wasting of strength, and probably with organic disease—in chronic\r\ndiarrhœa—diabetes—internal suppurations—confirmed phthisis—indurations\r\nof spleen or liver in an advanced stage—dropsies—scirrhus and\r\ncancer—biliary and urinary calculi—organic diseases of the heart—varicose\r\nveins—hypochondriasis and hysteria, with debility—original or idiopathic\r\nepilepsy, chorea, catalepsy and other convulsive affections of this\r\nnature—sterility dependent on organic disease of the reproductive\r\nviscera—alienation of mind, &c. On no account should women in a state of\r\npregnancy use the baths or waters of Wildbad.\r\n\r\nI have now presented the reader with all the information which I could\r\ncollect on the spot, from the conversations and writings of those best\r\nacquainted with the nature and properties of the waters. Most of the\r\nEnglish spa-goers will be disappointed in the magic effects of the\r\nbaths, as somewhat highly-coloured by Dr. Granville—and will consider\r\nthe locality as too sombre; while the appearance of the bathers and\r\ndrinkers—being veritable invalids—many of them on crutches, and many\r\napparently on their way to the grave—will prove anything but cheering\r\nto the British hypochondriac, and the sensitive nervous female. A\r\nconsiderable number of English leave Wildbad in a day or two after\r\narriving there—and of the few who take the waters, the majority become\r\nalarmed at the spa-fever or irritation, abandoning the waters at the very\r\ntime they are likely to prove serviceable.\r\n\r\nTo those, however, who prefer quietude to fashionable frivolity—and a\r\nsecluded glen to a dashing, gambling Kursaal, the baths and waters may\r\nprove serviceable in many of the complaints above enumerated. I would\r\nadvise all who sojourn at Baden-Baden, or who pass near Wildbad, to\r\nvisit this place, were it only for curiosity, and the singular scenery\r\nof its neighbourhood. The journey from Baden-Baden is an easy one of a\r\nsingle day—but that day should be a fine one, else all the pleasures of\r\nthe excursion will be lost. In fine, I can conscientiously aver that, in\r\nrespect to Wildbad, I have neither exaggerated its merits—\r\n\r\n    “Nor set down aught in malice.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHAFFHAUSE.\r\n\r\nWinding through the sombre solitudes of the Black Forest, we enter the\r\n_Vallée d’Enfer_, through the narrow and frowning pass, where MOREAU\r\nstemmed the torrent of the Austrian legions, as did Leonidas the myriads\r\nof Xerxes in the Straits of Thermopylæ. Little did that able but\r\nunfortunate general dream, during his memorable retreat through the Black\r\nForest, that, a few years afterwards, he would meet his death from the\r\nmouth of a French cannon, while combatting in the ranks of the Allies.[34]\r\n\r\nWhat a curse would _foreknowledge_ prove to man, although so ardently\r\ndesired by curious and eager mortals! A single glance through the\r\ntelescope of futurity would render us miserable for life! If good was in\r\nstore, we would relinquish all efforts to obtain it, as being certain.\r\nEvery day would seem an age till the happiness arrived—and when it came,\r\nall relish for it would be gone. On the other hand, if the glass showed\r\nmisfortune, sickness, and sorrow in the distance—the prospect would soon\r\ndrive the wretch insane!\r\n\r\n    Oh blindness to the future wisely given!\r\n\r\nThe DISPOSER of events alone can be the safe depository of prescience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRHINEFALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always experienced some degree of disappointment at the sight\r\nof waterfalls. Where the volume of water is great, the fall is,\r\ncomparatively trifling—and where the descent is from a great height,\r\nthen the stream is insignificant. If the NIAGARA could be translated to\r\nthe Staubach, and the mighty St. Lawrence thundered from a height of\r\neight hundred feet into the valley of Lauterbrunnen, the scene would be\r\nawfully grand, and sufficient to startle the Jaungfrau on her icy throne.\r\n\r\nThe Rhine, at Schaffhause, falls about seventy or eighty feet, and is by\r\nno means impressive, even when viewed from the camera obscura directly\r\nopposite the cataract. We drove from the town on a beautiful moonlight\r\nnight, and descending the stairs on the left bank of the river, we came\r\nclose to the water’s edge, and also to that of the fall itself. Here is\r\nthe spot to see and hear the deluge of water, all sparkling with foam, in\r\nthe mild light of the moon, come thundering from aloft, and threatening\r\nevery instant to overwhelm the spectator in the boiling flood. If terror\r\nbe a source of the sublime, there certainly is some degree of this\r\nemotion, mixed with the contemplation of a vast mass of water rolling\r\ndown from a great height, apparently in a direct course towards us. The\r\nroar of the cataract, too, is unlike that of any other sound, and adds\r\nconsiderably to the effect produced on the sense of sight.\r\n\r\nI do not know how the association of ideas first commenced, but I never\r\nsee a great waterfall, or a rapid river, without their suggesting\r\nthemselves as emblems of time or eternity. The torrent rolling along in\r\nthe same course through countless ages—\r\n\r\n    “In omne volubilis ævum”—\r\n\r\nwithout change or rest, is calculated to excite reflections on the great\r\nstream of time itself—and that inconceivable abyss—eternity—to which it\r\nleads. But all things move in circles. The water that runs in the river,\r\nmust _first_ fall from the clouds—and the rains that descend from the\r\nair, must _first_ rise from the earth. And so, perhaps, time and eternity\r\nmay be but parts of one vast, immeasurable, and incomprehensible cycle,\r\nwithout beginning, middle, or end!\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, ere many centuries roll away, the falls of the\r\nRhine will become merely a rapid. The stream has worn down four or\r\nfive channels in the rocky barrier, leaving three or four fragments,\r\nresembling the broken arches or piers of a natural bridge, standing up\r\nmany feet above the surface of the water where it begins to curl over the\r\nprecipice. The centre fragment is much higher than its brethren, and it\r\nis surmounted by a wooden shield, (how they managed to place it there is\r\nnot easily imagined,) with the arms and motto of Schaffhause.\r\n\r\n    “Deus spes\r\n    Nostra es.”\r\n\r\nThe torrent, thus split into four or five divisions, has given rise to\r\nsome extravagant comparisons, one of which is their similitude to five\r\nfoaming white steeds, that have broke away from their keepers.\r\n\r\n    Hark! ’tis the voice of the falling flood!\r\n      And see where the torrents come—\r\n    Thundering down through rock and wood,\r\n      Till the roar makes Echo dumb!\r\n\r\n    Like giant steeds from a distant waste,\r\n      That have madly broke away,\r\n    Leaping the crags in their headlong haste,\r\n      And trampling the waves to spray.\r\n\r\n    Five abreast! as their own foam white—\r\n      Their wild manes streaming far—\r\n    A worthy gift from a water-sprite\r\n      To his Ocean-monarch’s car![35]\r\n\r\nThe next best place to that which I have mentioned, for viewing the\r\nfalls, is in a boat, brought as close as prudence will permit to the\r\nboiling eddies. In a camera obscura opposite the falls, is a reflected\r\npicture of the cataract—but I cannot imagine why it should be preferable\r\nto the real object before our eyes.\r\n\r\nThere is a “German Switzerland” on the banks of the Elbe—and so is\r\nthere a “Swiss Germany” on the banks of the Rhine. From Schaffhause to\r\nConstance, Zurich, Berne, and even Geneva, the country is pretty and well\r\ncultivated; but it is not SWITZERLAND till we get past the above points,\r\nand penetrate among the mountains. For the same reason that we should\r\nascend the Rhine from Holland, we ought to enter Switzerland from the\r\nNorth, so that the grandeur and majesty of the scenery may be always on\r\nthe increase till we ascend the Splugen, the St. Gothard, the Simplon,\r\nthe St. Bernard, or the Mount Cenis.\r\n\r\nPursuing our route to the next SPA on the list of this tour, we come to\r\nZurich.\r\n\r\nZurich, like Geneva, is situated between a placid lake and a crystal\r\nriver. Lake Leman, having filtered its waters, discharges them through\r\nthe “blue and arrowy Rhone,” into the tideless Mediterranean, not to pass\r\non to the vast Atlantic, but again to rise in exhalations to the clouds,\r\nand fall—Heaven knows where. The lake of Zurich has a different taste. It\r\nsends its purified waters through the Limmatt, to mingle with the Rhine,\r\n(also freed from impurities in the lake of Constance,) and thence to find\r\nits way to the great Northern Ocean—probably to visit the Thames, the\r\nOhio, or even the Ganges, before it makes another aerial voyage to the\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nThe scenery about Zurich is tame and insipid, compared with that about\r\nGeneva, where the Jura and the high Alps in the distance, contrast with\r\nthe lovely Pais de Vaud in the vicinity of the lake.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE OF WALLENSTADT.\r\n\r\nThis lake, which is only a good day’s journey from Zurich, presents, in\r\nmy opinion, the finest lake-scenery in Switzerland. The mountains, on\r\nthe northern shore, rise almost perpendicularly to the height of five or\r\nsix thousand feet, sprinkled with ledges of rock, on which are perched\r\nthe shepherd’s chalet, and giving footing and scanty nutriment to the\r\npine and alpine shrubs and flowers. The mountains on the southern side\r\nare equally high, but not so perpendicular in their descent to the lake;\r\nbut the whole circle of scenery is most magnificent. The transit of the\r\nlake is east and west, a distance of some twelve or thirteen miles, and\r\nthe passage is usually favoured by a kind of trade wind, which blows from\r\nthe westward during one part of the day, and from the eastward during\r\nthe other. The little village of WESEN, is the point of embarkation from\r\nthe Zurich side, and is situated most romantically under stupendous\r\nmountains. We started at two o’clock, with carriage, horses, and live\r\nlumber, in the passage-boat, which did not convey much idea of safety,\r\nbeing low, flat, and rigged with a tall frail mast and square sail.\r\nThe dangers of the Wallenstadt navigation are, no doubt exaggerated;\r\nbut it is evident that, along the whole of the northern board of the\r\nlake there is but one small spot where a boat could put in for safety\r\nin a storm. Along this shore we sailed with a fine breeze, and enjoyed\r\nthe prospect of one of the finest scenes in Switzerland. The mountains\r\non the northern board are so high and precipitous, that I think it is\r\nphysically impossible for a gale of wind to blow direct on the shore,\r\nwhen a boat comes close to the rocks. It could only be by the impulse of\r\nthe waves that a boat might be forced amongst the breakers. Accidents,\r\nhowever, very seldom happen. The afternoon was clear sunshine—the boatmen\r\nabandoned the oars, being wafted along by a fine breeze—the song was\r\ncommenced—and the RANZ DE VACHE was returned from the ledges of rock, and\r\npatches of vegetation among the cliffs, by many a blithsome shepherd,\r\ntending his flocks, or collecting his little autumnal harvest—the long\r\nand slender cataracts poured in sheets of gauze along many a craggy\r\nprecipice—and the whole scene was kept as a moving panorama by the steady\r\nprogression of the boat.\r\n\r\nIn the enjoyment of Swiss or Alpine scenery, everything depends on the\r\nstate of the atmosphere, and on that of our health and spirits at the\r\ntime. Hence it is that one person is delighted with a prospect, which\r\nanother passes without pleasure or surprize at all. Of this I am certain,\r\nthat a good view of this lake’s scenery can never be erased from the\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nWe landed at the little town of Wallenstadt, situated near the lake, in\r\na marshy and malarious locality, often inundated by the floods, and very\r\ninsalubrious. No traveller should sleep here, as the distance to SARGANS\r\nis only eight or nine miles.\r\n\r\nWe slept at this rook’s nest, perched on an eminence above malarious and\r\nalluvial marshes, and at the foot of a high and craggy mount, from the\r\nsummit of which there is a superb prospect of the Rhine on its way to\r\nConstance, and of a sea of Alps, of all altitudes—many of them shining\r\nwith snow and glaciers. Those who do not like to mount the Scholberg, may\r\nstill enjoy a magnificent panorama from the ruins of an old chateau just\r\nabove Sargans, and which is of very easy access. The town itself presents\r\nbetter air than fare—the two inns being little better than _cabarets_,\r\nbut health and appetite compensate well for coarse viands and hard beds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBATHS OF PFEFFERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the strange places into which man has penetrated in search of\r\ntreasure or health, there is probably not one on this earth, or under it,\r\nmore wonderful than the BATHS OF PFEFFERS, situated in the country of\r\nthe Grisons, a few miles distant from the Splugen road, as it leads from\r\nWallenstadt to Coire. They are little known to, and still less frequented\r\nby the English; for we could not learn that any of our countrymen had\r\nvisited them during the summer of 1834.\r\n\r\nHaving procured five small and steady horses accustomed to the locality,\r\na party of three ladies and two gentlemen[36] started from the little\r\ntown of Ragatz on a beautiful morning in August, and commenced a steep\r\nand zig-zag ascent up the mountain, through a forest of majestic pines\r\nand other trees. In a quarter of an hour, we heard the roar of a torrent,\r\nbut could see nothing of itself or even its bed. The path, however, soon\r\napproached the verge of a dark and tremendous ravine, the sides of which\r\nwere composed of perpendicular rocks several hundred feet high, and at\r\nthe bottom of which the TAMINA, a rapid mountain torrent, foamed along\r\nin its course to the valley of Sargans, there to fall into the upper\r\nRhine. The stream itself, however, was far beyond our view, and was only\r\nknown by its hollow and distant murmurs. The ascent, for the first three\r\nmiles, is extremely fatiguing, so that the horses were obliged to take\r\nbreath every ten minutes. The narrow path, (for it is only a kind of\r\nmule-track,) often winded along the very brink of the precipice, on our\r\nleft, yet the eye could not penetrate to the bottom of the abyss. After\r\nmore than an hour of toilsome climbing, we emerged from the wood, and\r\nfound ourselves in one of the most picturesque and romantic spots that\r\ncan well be imagined. The road now meanders horizontally through a high,\r\nbut cultivated region, towards, the village of Valentz, through fields,\r\ngardens, vineyards, and meadows, studded with chaumiers and chalets,\r\nperched fantastically on projecting ledges of rock, or sheltered from the\r\nwinds by tall and verdant pines. The prospect from Valentz, or rather\r\nfrom above the village, is one of the most beautiful and splendid I have\r\nanywhere seen in Switzerland. We are there at a sufficient distance from\r\nthe horrid ravine, to contemplate it without terror, and listen to the\r\nroaring torrent, thundering unseen, along its rugged and precipitous bed.\r\nBeyond the ravine we see the monastery and village of Pfeffers, perched\r\non a high and apparently inaccessible promontory, over which rise alpine\r\nmountains, their sides covered with woods, their summits with snow, and\r\ntheir gorges glittering with glaciers. But it is towards the East that\r\nthe prospect is most magnificent and varied. The eye ranges, with equal\r\npleasure and astonishment, over the valley of Sargans, through which\r\nrolls the infant Rhine, and beyond which the majestic ranges of the\r\nRhetian Alps, ten thousand feet high, rise one over the other, till their\r\nsummits mingle with the clouds. Among these ranges the SCESA-PLANA, the\r\nANGSTENBERG, the FLESCH, (like a gigantic pyramid,) and in the distance\r\nthe Alps that tower round Feldkirck are the most prominent features.\r\nDuring our journey to the baths, the morning sun played on the snowy\r\nsummits of the distant mountains, and marked their forms on the blue\r\nexpanse behind them, in the most distinct outlines. But, on our return,\r\nin the afternoon, when the fleecy clouds had assembled, in fantastic\r\ngroups, along the lofty barrier, the reflexions and refractions of the\r\nsolar beams threw a splendid crown of glory round the icy heads of the\r\nRhetian Alps—changing that “cold sublimity” with which the morning\r\natmosphere had invested them, into a glow of illumination which no pen\r\nor pencil could portray. To enjoy the widest possible range of this\r\nmatchless prospect, the tourist must climb the peaks that overhang the\r\nvillage, when his eye may wander over the whole of the Grison Alps and\r\nvalleys, even to the lake of Constance.\r\n\r\nFrom Valentz we turned abruptly down towards the ravine, at the very\r\nbottom of which are the BATHS OF PFEFFERS. The descent is by a series\r\nof acute and precipitous tourniquets, requiring great caution, as the\r\nhorses themselves could hardly keep on their legs, even when eased of\r\ntheir riders. At length we found ourselves in the area of a vast edifice,\r\nresembling an overgrown factory, with a thousand windows, and six or\r\nseven stories high. It is built on a ledge of rock that lies on the\r\nleft bank of the TAMINA torrent, which chafes along its foundation. The\r\nprecipice on the opposite side of the Tamina, and distant about fifty\r\npaces from the mansion or rather hospital, rises five or six hundred\r\nfeet, as perpendicular as a wall, keeping the edifice in perpetual shade,\r\nexcept for a few hours in the middle of the day. The left bank of the\r\nravine, on which the hospital stands, is less precipitous, as it admits\r\nof a zig-zag path to and from the Baths. The locale, altogether, of such\r\nan establishment, at the very bottom of a frightful ravine, and for ever\r\nchafed by a roaring torrent, is the most singularly wild and picturesque\r\nI had ever beheld; but the wonders of Pfeffers are not yet even glanced\r\nat.[37]\r\n\r\nFrom the western extremity of this vast asylum of invalids, a narrow\r\nwooden bridge spans the Tamina, and by it we gain footing on a small\r\nplatform of a rock on the opposite side. Here a remarkable phenomenon\r\npresents itself. The deep ravine, which had hitherto preserved a width\r\nof some 150 feet, contracts, all at once, into a narrow cleft or\r\ncrevasse, of less than 20 feet, whose marble sides shoot up from the bed\r\nof the torrent, to a height of four or five hundred feet, not merely\r\nperpendicular, but actually inclining towards each other, so that, at\r\ntheir summits, they almost touch, thus leaving a narrow fissure through\r\nwhich a faint glimmering of light descends, and just serves to render\r\nobjects visible within this gloomy cavern. Out of this recess the Tamina\r\ndarts in a sheet of foam, and with a deafening noise reverberated from\r\nthe rocks within and without the crevasse. On approaching the entrance,\r\nthe eye penetrates along a majestic vista of marble walls in close\r\napproximation, and terminating in obscurity, with a narrow waving line of\r\nsky above, and a roaring torrent below! Along the southern wall of this\r\nsombre gorge, a fragile scaffold, of only two planks in breadth, is seen\r\nto run, suspended—as it were—in air, fifty feet above the torrent, and\r\nthree or four hundred feet beneath the crevice that admits air and light\r\nfrom Heaven into the profound abyss. This frail and frightful foot-path\r\nis continued (will it be believed?) nearly _half a mile_ into the marble\r\nwomb of the mountain! Its construction must have been a work of great\r\ndifficulty and peril; for its transit cannot be made even by the most\r\ncurious and adventurous travellers, without fear and trembling, amounting\r\noften to a sense of shuddering and horror. Along these two planks we\r\ncrept or crawled, with faltering steps and palpitating hearts. It has\r\nbeen my fortune to visit most of the wonderful localities of this globe,\r\nbut an equal to this I never beheld.\r\n\r\n“Imagination, (says an intelligent traveller,) the most vivid, could\r\nnot portray the portals of Tartarus under forms more hideous than those\r\nwhich Nature has displayed in this place. We enter this gorge on a bridge\r\nof planks (pont de planches) sustained by wedges driven into the rocks.\r\nIt takes a quarter of an hour or more to traverse this bridge, and it\r\nrequires the utmost precaution. It is suspended over the Tamina, which\r\nis heard rolling furiously at a great depth beneath. The walls of this\r\ncavern, twisted, torn, and split (les parois laterales contournées,\r\nfendues, et dechirées) in various ways, rise perpendicular, and even\r\nincline towards each other, in the form of a dome; whilst the faint light\r\nthat enters from the portal at the end, and the crevice above, diminishes\r\nas we proceed;—the cold and humidity augmenting the horror produced by\r\nthe scene. The fragments of rock sometimes overhang this gangway in such\r\na manner, that the passenger cannot walk upright:—at others, the marble\r\nwall recedes so much, that he is unable to lean against it for support.\r\nThe scaffold is narrow, often slippery; and sometimes there is but a\r\nsingle plank, separating us from the black abyss of the Tamina.[38] He\r\nwho has cool courage, a steady eye, and a firm step, ought to attempt\r\nthis formidable excursion (épouvantable excursion) in clear and dry\r\nweather, lest he should find the planks wet and slippery. He should start\r\nin the middle of the day, with a slow and measured step, and without a\r\nstick. The safest plan is to have two guides supporting a pole, on the\r\ninside of which the stranger is to walk.”\r\n\r\nWe neglected this precaution, and four out of the five pushed on, even\r\nwithout a guide at all. At forty or fifty paces from the entrance the\r\ngloom increases, while the roar of the torrent beneath, reverberated from\r\nthe sides of the cavern, augments the sense of danger and the horror of\r\nthe scene. The meridian sun penetrated sufficiently through the narrow\r\nline of fissure at the summit of the dome, to throw a variety of lights\r\nand of shadows over the vast masses of variegated marble composing the\r\nwalls of this stupendous cavern, compared with which, those of Salsette,\r\nElephanta, and even Staffa, shrink into insignificance. A wooden pipe,\r\nwhich conveys the hot waters from their source to the baths, runs\r\nalong in the angle between the scaffold and the rocks, and proves very\r\nserviceable, both as a support for one hand while pacing the plank,\r\nand as a seat, when the passenger wishes to rest, and contemplate the\r\nwonders of the cavern. At about one-third of the distance inward, I\r\nwould advise the tourist to halt, and survey the singular locality in\r\nwhich he is placed. The inequality of breadth in the long chink that\r\ndivides the dome above, admits the light in very different proportions,\r\nand presents objects in a variety of aspects. The first impression which\r\noccupies the mind is caused by the cavern itself, with reflection on the\r\nportentous convulsion of Nature which split the marble rock in twain,\r\nand opened a gigantic aqueduct for the mountain torrent.[39] After a few\r\nminutes’ rumination on the action of subterranean fire, our attention\r\nis attracted to the slow but powerful operation of water on the solid\r\nparietes of this infernal grotto. We plainly perceive that the boisterous\r\ntorrent has, in the course of time, and especially when swelled by rains,\r\ncaused wonderful changes both in its bed and its banks. I would direct\r\nthe attention of the traveller to a remarkable excavation formed by the\r\nwaters on the opposite side of the chasm, and in a part more sombre than\r\nusual, in consequence of a bridge that spans the crevice above, and leads\r\nto the Convent of Pfeffers. This natural grotto is hollowed out of the\r\nmarble rock to the depth of 30 feet, being nearly 40 feet in width, by\r\n26 feet in height. It is difficult not to attribute it to art; and, as\r\nthe whole cavern constantly reminds us of the Tartarean Regions, this\r\nbeautifully vaulted grotto seems to be fitted for the throne of Pluto and\r\nProserpine—or, perhaps, for the tribunal of Rhadamanthus and his brothers\r\nof the Bench, while passing sentence on the ghosts that glide down this\r\nAcheron or Cocytus—for had the TAMINA been known to the ancient poets, it\r\nwould assuredly have been ranked as one of the rivers of Hell.\r\n\r\nOne of the most startling phenomena, however, results from a perspective\r\nview into the cavern, when about midway, or rather less, from its portal.\r\nThe rocky vista ends in obscurity; but gleams and columns of light burst\r\ndown, in many places, from the meridian sun, through this “palpable\r\nobscure,” so as to produce a wonderful variety of light and shade, as\r\nwell as of bas-relief, along the fractured walls. While sitting on the\r\nrude wooden conduit before alluded to, and meditating on the infernal\r\nregion upon which I had entered, I was surprised to behold, at a great\r\ndistance, the figures of human beings, or thin shadows (for I could not\r\ntell which), advancing slowly towards me—suspended between Heaven and\r\nearth—or, at least, between the vault of the cavern and the torrent of\r\nthe Tamina, without any apparent pathway to sustain their steps, but\r\nseemingly treading in air, like disembodied spirits! While my attention\r\nwas rivetted on these figures, they suddenly disappeared; and the first\r\nimpression on my mind was, that they had fallen and perished in the\r\nhorrible abyss beneath. The painful sensation was soon relieved by the\r\nreappearance of the personages in more distinct shapes, and evidently\r\ncomposed of flesh and blood. Again they vanished from my sight; and,\r\nto my no small astonishment, I beheld their ghosts or their shadows\r\nadvancing along the opposite side of the cavern! These, and many other\r\noptical illusions, were caused, of course, by the peculiar nature of the\r\nlocality, and the unequal manner in which the light penetrated from above\r\ninto this sombre chasm.\r\n\r\nSurprise was frequently turned into a sense of danger, when the parties,\r\nadvancing and retreating, met on this narrow scaffold. The “laws of\r\nthe road” being different on the Continent from those in Old England,\r\nmy plan was to screw myself up into the smallest compass, close to the\r\nrock, and thus allow passengers to steal by without opposition. We found\r\nthat comparatively few penetrated to the extremity of the cavern and the\r\nsource of the Thermæ—the majority being frightened, or finding themselves\r\nincapable of bearing the sight of the rapid torrent under their feet,\r\nwithout any solid security against precipitation into the infernal gulf.\r\nTo the honour of the English ladies, I must say that they explored\r\nthe source of the waters with the most undaunted courage, and without\r\nentertaining a thought of returning from a half-finished tour to the\r\nregions below.[40]\r\n\r\nAdvancing still farther into the cavern, another phenomenon presented\r\nitself, for which we were unable to account at first. Every now and then\r\nwe observed a gush of vapour or smoke (we could not tell which) issue\r\nfrom the further extremity of the rock on the left, spreading itself over\r\nthe walls of the cavern, and ascending towards the crevice in the dome.\r\nIt looked like an explosion of steam; but the roar of the torrent would\r\nhave prevented us from hearing any noise, if such had occurred. We soon\r\nfound, however, that it was occasioned by the rush of vapour from the\r\ncavern in which the thermal source is situated, every time the door was\r\nopened for the ingress or egress of visitors to and from this natural\r\nvapour-bath. At such moments the whole scene is so truly Tartarean, that\r\nhad Virgil and Dante been acquainted with it, they need not have strained\r\ntheir imaginations in portraying the ideal abodes of fallen angels,\r\ninfernal gods, and departed spirits, but painted a HADES from Nature,\r\nwith all the advantage of truth and reality in its favour.\r\n\r\nOur ingress occupied nearly half an hour, when we found ourselves at\r\nthe extremity of the parapet, on a jutting ledge of rock, and where the\r\ncavern assumed an unusually sombre complexion, in consequence of the\r\ncliffs actually uniting, or nearly so, at the summit of the dome. Here,\r\ntoo, the TAMINA struggled, roared, and foamed through the narrow, dark,\r\nand rugged gorge with tremendous impetuosity and deafening noise, the\r\nsounds being echoed and reverberated a thousand times by the fractured\r\nangles and projections of the cavern. We were now at the source of the\r\nTHERMÆ. Ascending some steps cut out of the rock, we came to a door,\r\nwhich opened, and instantly enveloped us in tepid steam. We entered a\r\ngrotto in the solid marble, but of what dimensions we could form no\r\nestimate, since it was dark as midnight, and full of dense and fervid\r\nvapour. We were quickly in an universal perspiration. The guides hurried\r\nus forward into another grotto, still deeper in the rock, where the steam\r\nwas suffocating, and where we exuded at every pore. It was as dark as\r\npitch. An owl would not have been able to see an eagle within a foot of\r\nits saucer eyes. We were told to stoop and stretch out our hands. We did\r\nso, and immersed them in the boiling—or, at least, the gurgling, source\r\nof the PFEFFERS. We even quaffed at this fountain of Hygeia.\r\n\r\nOften had we slept in damp linen, while travelling through Holland,\r\nGermany, and Switzerland. We had now, by way of variety, a waking set\r\nof integuments saturated with moisture _ab interno_, as well as _ab\r\nexterno_, to such an extent, that I believe each of us would have weighed\r\nat least half a stone more at our exit than on our entrance into this\r\nstew-pan of the Grison Alps.\r\n\r\nOn emerging into the damp, gelid, and gloomy atmosphere of the cavern,\r\nevery thing appeared of a dazzling brightness after our short immersion\r\nin the Cimmerian darkness of the grotto. The transition of temperature\r\nwas equally as abrupt as that of light. The vicissitude could have\r\nbeen little less than 50 or 60 degrees of Fahrenheit in one instant,\r\nwith all the disadvantage of dripping garments! It was like shifting\r\nthe scene, with more than theatrical celerity, from the Black Hole\r\nof Calcutta to Fury Beach, or the snows of Nova Zembla. Some of the\r\nparty, less experienced in the effects of travelling than myself,\r\nconsidered themselves destined to illustrate the well-known allegory\r\nof the discontented—and that they would inevitably carry away with\r\nthem a large cargo of that which thousands come here annually to get\r\nrid of—RHEUMATISM. I confess that I was not without some misgivings\r\nmyself on this point, seeing that we had neither the means of changing\r\nour clothes nor of drying them—except by the heat of our bodies in the\r\nmountain breeze. The Goddess of Health, however, who is nearly related\r\nto the Genius of Travelling, preserved us from all the bad consequences,\r\nthermometrical and hygrometrical, of these abrupt vicissitudes.[41]\r\n\r\nWe retrograded along the narrow plank that suspended us over the\r\nprofound abyss with caution, fear, and astonishment. The TAMINA seemed\r\nto roar more loud and savage beneath us, as if incensed at our safe\r\nretreat. The sun had passed the meridian, and the gorge had assumed a\r\nfar more lugubrious aspect than it wore on our entrance. The shivered\r\nrocks and splintered pinnacles that rose on each side of the torrent,\r\nin gothic arches of altitude sublime, seemed to frown on our retreating\r\nfootsteps—while the human figures that moved at a distance along\r\nthe crazy plank, before and behind us, frequently lost their just\r\nproportions, and assumed the most grotesque and extraordinary shapes\r\nand dimensions, according to the degree of light admitted by the narrow\r\nfissure above, and the scarcely discernible aperture at the extremity\r\nof this wonderful gorge. The TAMINA, meanwhile, did not fail to play\r\nits part in the gorgeous scene—astonishing the eye by the rapidity of\r\nits movements, and astounding the ear by the vibrations of its echoes.\r\nIt seemed to growl more furiously as we receded from the depths of the\r\ncrevasse.\r\n\r\nAt length we gained the portal, and, as the sun was still darting his\r\nbright rays into the deepest recesses of the ravine, glancing from\r\nthe marble rocks, and glittering on the boiling torrent, the sudden\r\ntransition from Cimmerian gloom to dazzling day-light, appeared like\r\nenchantment. While crossing the trembling bridge, I looked back on a\r\nscene which can never be eradicated from my memory. It is the most\r\nsingular and impressive I have ever beheld on this globe, and compared\r\nwith which, the BRUNNENS are “bubbles” indeed![42]\r\n\r\nWhile examining the waters, the baths, and the internal economy of\r\nthe vast VALETUDINARIUM that stands in this savage locality, the bell\r\nannounced the approach of the second, or superior dinner, which happened\r\nthat day to be rather later than usual. The SALON, overlooking the\r\ntorrent of the Tamina, was soon replenished with guests of the better\r\norder; the canaille, or swarm of inferior invalids having dined two hours\r\nor more previously, in the common SALLE A MANGER. It needed but little\r\nprofessional discrimination to class and specify them. The majority\r\nproclaimed the causes of their visits to the Pfeffers. Rheumatism,\r\nscrofula, and cutaneous diseases, formed the prominent features in this\r\nmotley assemblage. Invalids, with chronic complaints, real or imaginary,\r\nsuch as abound at all watering places, foreign and domestic, were mingled\r\nin the group; while a small portion, including our own party, evinced\r\nanything but corporeal ailments—unless a “CANINE APPETITE” at a genuine\r\nGerman _table-d’hôte_ may be ranked among the evils to which English\r\nflesh is heir. Some monks, from the neighbouring monastery, (to which the\r\nBaths belong,) took rank, and indeed precedence, in this small division.\r\nThe mountain breeze and fervid sun of the Convent of Pfeffers had bronzed\r\nthem with much of that nut-brown complexion, which travelling exercise in\r\nthe open air had conferred on their British visitors; while their sleek\r\ncheeks and portly corporations proved, almost to a demonstration, that\r\nthe holy fathers descended into the profound ravine of the Tamina to\r\ngive their benediction to the waters, rather than to drink them—and to\r\nadd a sacred zest to the viands of the REFECTORY, by the alacrity with\r\nwhich they swallowed them. Their appearance illustrated the truth of the\r\nadage—“What will not poison will fatten.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERS OF PFEFFERS.\r\n\r\nThe Waters of PFEFFERS have neither taste, smell, nor colour. They\r\nwill keep for ten years, without depositing a sediment, or losing\r\ntheir transparency. But we are not to infer that they are destitute of\r\nmedicinal powers, because they possess no sensible properties. In their\r\nchemical composition, they have hitherto shewn but few ingredients;\r\nand those of the simpler saline substances, common to most mineral\r\nsprings.[43] It does not follow, however, that they contain no active\r\nmaterials because chemistry is not able to detect them. Powerful agents\r\nmay be diffused in waters, and which are incapable of analysis, or\r\ndestructible by the process employed for that purpose. The only sure test\r\nis EXPERIENCE of their effects on the human body. It is not probable that\r\nthe Baths of Pfeffers would have attracted such multitudes of invalids,\r\nannually, from Switzerland, Germany, and Italy; and that for six\r\ncenturies, if their remedial agency had been null or imaginary.[44] Their\r\nvisitors are not of that fashionable class, who run to watering-places\r\nfor pleasure rather than for health—or, to dispel the vapours of the\r\ntown by the pure air of the coast or the country. Yet, as human nature\r\nis essentially the same in all ranks of society, I have no doubt that\r\nmuch of the fame acquired by the Baths of Pfeffers, has been owing to the\r\nauxiliary influence of air, locality, change of scene, moral impressions,\r\nand the peculiar mode of using the waters. Their temperature—100° of\r\nFahren.—certain physical phenomena which they evince, and the nature of\r\nthe diseases which they are reported to cure, leave little doubt in my\r\nmind that their merits, though overrated, like those of all other mineral\r\nsprings, are very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe disorders for which they are most celebrated, are rheumatic and\r\nneuralgic pains, glandular swellings, and cutaneous eruptions. But they\r\nare also resorted to by a host of invalids afflicted with those anomalous\r\nand chronic affections, to which nosology has assigned no name, and for\r\nwhich the Pharmacopœia affords very few remedies. As the Baths belong to\r\nthe neighbouring Convent of Pfeffers, and, as the holy fathers afford\r\nnot only spiritual consolation to the patients, but medical assistance\r\nin directing the means of cure, there is every reason to believe, or, at\r\nleast, to hope, that the moral, or rather divine influence of Religion\r\nco-operates with mere physical agency, in removing disease and restoring\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nThe Waters of Pfeffers are led from their sombre source in the cavern,\r\nalong the narrow scaffold before described, into a series of baths\r\nscooped out of the rocky foundation of this vast hospital, each bath\r\ncapable of accommodating a considerable number of people at the same\r\ntime. The thermal waters are constantly running into and out of the\r\nbaths—or rather through them, so that the temperature is preserved\r\nuniform, and the waters themselves in a state of comparative purity,\r\nnotwithstanding the numbers immersed in them. The baths are arched\r\nwith stone—the window to each is small, admitting little light, and\r\nless air:—and, as the doors are kept shut, except when the bathers are\r\nentering or retiring, the whole space not occupied by water, is full of\r\na dense vapour, as hot as the Thermæ themselves. The very walls of the\r\nbaths are warm, and always dripping with moisture. Such are the SUDATORIA\r\nin which the German, Swiss, and Italian invalids indulge more luxuriously\r\nthan ever did the Romans in the Baths of Caracalla. In these they lie\r\ndaily, from two, to six, eight, ten—and sometimes sixteen hours![45] The\r\nwhole exterior of the body is thus soaked, softened—parboiled; while\r\nthe interior is drenched by large quantities swallowed by the mouth—the\r\npatient, all this while, breathing the dense vapour that hovers over the\r\nbaths. The Waters of Pfeffers, therefore, inhaled and imbibed, exhaled\r\nand absorbed, for so many hours daily, must permeate every vessel,\r\npenetrate every gland, and percolate through every pore of the body. So\r\nsingular a process of human maceration in one of Nature’s cauldrons,\r\nconducted with German patience and German enthusiasm, must, I think,\r\nrelax many a rigid muscle—unbend many a contracted joint—soothe many an\r\naching nerve—clear many an unsightly surface—resolve many an indurated\r\ngland—open many an obstructed passage—and restore many a suspended\r\nfunction. The fervid and detergent streams of the Pfeffers, in fact,\r\nare actually turned, daily and hourly, through the Augean stable of the\r\nhuman constitution, and made to rout out a host of maladies indomitable\r\nby the prescriptions of the most sage physicians. The fable of MEDEA’S\r\nrevival of youthful vigour in wasted limbs is very nearly realized in the\r\nmountains of the Grisons, and in the savage ravine of the TAMINA. Lepers\r\nare here purified—the lame commit their crutches to the flames—the tumid\r\nthroat and scrofulous neck are reduced to symmetrical dimensions—and\r\nsleep revisits the victim of rheumatic pains and neuralgic tortures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPATHY, HYDRO-SUDO-PATHY—OR HYDROTHERAPEIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the titles given to a system of healing human maladies by\r\nmeans of perspiration and cold water. It is making rapid progress\r\nin Germany, that land of ideality—and the tribe of other pathys.\r\nHomœopathy—allopathy—and even spa-pathy are in danger. Although it is no\r\nnew system, being practised for a long time by the Russians, yet it is\r\nonly about fifteen years since Priestnitz, a Silesian peasant, introduced\r\nit amongst his native mountains, and in a shape and manner differing\r\nsomewhat from the Russian practice.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the application of cold water to the surface\r\nof the body, whether generally or locally, is a powerful agent, when\r\nskilfully managed. The chill that is painfully felt on the first\r\nplunge—the recoil of the circulation from the surface to the great\r\ncentral organs and vessels—the shrinking of all external parts—the rapid\r\nabstraction of animal heat—the hurried respiration—and last and most\r\nimportant of all—the reaction which follows the bath—are all important\r\nphenomena, that may work much good or evil in the animal economy,\r\naccording as they are watched and regulated. The reaction after the cold\r\nbath is not less curious than the recoil. The heart and great internal\r\norgans seem overwhelmed and stunned, for a time, by the first shock.\r\nBut soon after emerging from the bath, they begin to recover energy,\r\nand to free themselves from the volume of congested blood, under which\r\nthey laboured. They then drive the circulation to the surface with\r\nincreasing force, filling and distending the vessels of the skin beyond\r\nthe normal or medium condition. With this distension comes a glow of\r\nheat all over the body, and a feeling of elasticity, or bien-être, which\r\nit is difficult to describe. A third series of phenomena now commence.\r\nAll the glandular organs of the body now take on an augmented degree of\r\nactivity, and their secretions become more copious than before the bath.\r\nContemporary with this increase of secretion internally, the skin itself\r\nacts more vigorously, and not only the insensible, but the sensible\r\nperspiration becomes more copious. In fact, the cold bath gives rise to\r\na series, or rather three series of phenomena, very closely resembling\r\na paroxysm of ague—viz. the cold, hot, and sweating stages. After a few\r\nhours all the functions return to their normal or usual routine of duty.\r\n\r\nBut things do not always run thus smoothly. If any particular internal\r\norgan be much disordered in function, or at all changed in structure,\r\nit is very apt to be so overpowered by the recoil or first shock of the\r\ncold bath, that when reaction comes on, it is only partial and imperfect,\r\nin consequence of the weak organ or organs remaining in a state of\r\ncongestion, and incapable of freeing themselves from the overplus of\r\nblood determined upon them by the retreat of the circulation from the\r\nsurface. Then we have headache, lassitude, drowsiness, general malaise,\r\nor local uneasiness, imperfect reaction, scanty or disordered secretions,\r\nwith many other uncomfortable feelings, instead of that elasticity and\r\nbuoyancy which have been already noticed.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further on the cold bath, let us glance at the peculiar\r\nmanner in which it is employed by the hydro-therapeutic doctors of\r\nGermany, who have now establishments in many of the principal towns.\r\n\r\nAbout four or five o’clock in the morning, the patient is wrapped up\r\nto the chin (while in bed) in a thick woollen shirt. Outside of this\r\nis placed another covering of down, fur, or any warm and impermeable\r\nmaterial. In a short time the disengagement of animal heat from the body\r\nthus enveloped, forms a fervid atmosphere around him, which soon induces\r\na copious perspiration, in the greater number of individuals. It has\r\nbeen observed that, in diseased parts, as for instance, in the joints\r\nof gouty people, the perspiration was longest in breaking out. When the\r\nskin is obstinate, friction and other means are used to accelerate the\r\ncutaneous discharge. When the physician judges that the perspiration has\r\nbeen sufficient, the patient is quickly disrobed and plunged into a cold\r\nbath, which is kept ready at the side of his bed. The first shock is very\r\nunpleasant; but that over, the invalid feels very comfortable, and when\r\nthe process is likely to prove favourable, there is frequently observed\r\non the surface of the water a kind of viscid scum, the supposed morbid\r\nmatter thrown off from the body. The period of immersion in the cold\r\nbath is carefully watched, for if protracted too long it proves hurtful,\r\nor even dangerous. Some people will not bear the cold immersion above a\r\nminute—others are allowed to remain till the approach of a second shiver.\r\nWhere the patient is very delicate or weak, the temperature of the bath\r\nis raised a little. In other cases, the bath is artificially depressed\r\nbelow the natural temperature of the water.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the bath, the patient is quickly dressed, and\r\nimmediately commences exercise, and drinks abundantly of cold water. The\r\nlimit to this ingurgitation is sense of pain or weight in the stomach.\r\nThe patient, although rather averse to the cold drink at first, soon\r\nbecomes fond of it, and will swallow fifteen or twenty goblets with a\r\nkeen relish. After the promenade and cold drink is over, a nourishing\r\nbreakfast is taken. All stimulating or exciting beverages are entirely\r\nprohibited. The appetite generally becomes keen, and the digestion,\r\neven of dyspeptics, strong and effective during this course. Between\r\nbreakfast and dinner is variously employed, according to the strength of\r\nthe patients or the nature of the disease. Some take riding or pedestrian\r\nexercise—others gymnastics—and a few have more cold water, as a plunging\r\nor shower bath.\r\n\r\nThe dinner is to be light, and soon after mid-day. It is generally taken\r\nwith a keen appetite. During the three or four hours after dinner, all\r\nexercise of mind or body is forbidden, but sleep is not to be indulged\r\nin. Towards evening, some of the stronger patients repeat the same\r\nprocess which they underwent in the morning; but those who are weak,\r\nor in whom the crisis is approaching, only take cold water to drink in\r\nmoderation. After a slight supper the patient retires to sleep, in order\r\nthat he may early resume the routine of the water-cure.\r\n\r\nThe professors of this system vary the mode of application almost\r\ninfinitely—especially the external application of the cold water,\r\naccording to the general or local seat of the complaint. They act\r\nvery much on the doctrine of revulsion or derivation. Thus when there\r\nare symptoms of fulness or congestion about the head or the chest, a\r\nhalf-bath or hip-bath of cold water is employed, disregarding the first\r\nimpression of cold on the lower parts of the body, but looking to the\r\n_reaction_ which is to take place there, and to the consequent derivation\r\nof blood from the head and chest. Foot-baths, cold lotions, fomentations,\r\nand poultices are variously used, according to the nature or seat of the\r\nmalady.\r\n\r\nLike the spa waters, this HYDROTHERAPEIA produces, in a great many\r\ninstances, a CRISIS. For some days the patients feel themselves much more\r\nenergetic and comfortable than before the course was begun; but after a\r\ntime “a veritable state of fever is produced, the result of this general\r\neffervescence.”[46] Then the symptoms of the complaint, whatever it may\r\nbe, are all exasperated and acquire an increase of intensity—even old\r\ndiseases, that were forgotten, will sometimes re-appear—but all this\r\ncommotion is the precursor of a salutary crisis and a return to health. A\r\nkind of prickly heat, with itching of the skin, is a common occurrence in\r\nthe course of the cure. “The effects produced even on organic diseases by\r\nthis hydro-therapeutic treatment would convince the most sceptical of its\r\nwonderful efficacy.”—_Engel._\r\n\r\nThe diseases to which this remedy is now applied in Germany are numerous\r\nand very different. Fevers, even of the most inflammatory kind, are\r\nsaid to yield to it. Pure inflammations of vital organs are fearlessly\r\nsubmitted to it. The first case related by Dr. Engel, is one of\r\npneumonia, well marked, in a young girl who had been exposed to a current\r\nof cold air after violent exercise in the heat of the day. Dr. Weiss\r\nordered her to be enveloped in a blanket, wet with cold water, and then\r\nother blankets over the wet one, with plenty of cold water to drink.\r\nSome amelioration of the symptoms followed; but in two hours they were\r\nagain intense. Two foreign physicians accompanied Dr. E. to the bed-side\r\nof the patient, and prognosticated a fatal termination unless she were\r\nbled, and the cold water treatment declined. Dr. E. with the greatest\r\nconfidence, ordered the blanket to be again wetted with cold water. This\r\nsecond application was followed by increase of the burning heat, and also\r\nby delirium. Notwithstanding the remonstrances of the foreigners, Dr. E.\r\nwas still firm in his purpose—and ordered the wet blankets to be applied\r\nevery half-hour. No change took place till after the sixth application,\r\nwhen the kidneys acted copiously. The seventh application was followed by\r\ndiminution of the thirst and heat—the patient became more tranquil—began\r\nto perspire—and fell into a short sleep. The perspiration continued\r\ncopious for twenty-two hours, and was kept up by the drinking of large\r\nquantities of cold water. The perspiration having ceased, the patient\r\nwas put into a cold half-bath (slipper) where the respiration became\r\nmore free. On being taken out and covered over she perspired copiously.\r\nThe wet blankets were now applied only twice a day, with an occasional\r\nhalf-bath. On the fifth day she was well. (Weiss.)\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther, it will be proper to explain that the\r\ntransition from a hot bath to a cold one, even in a state of\r\nperspiration, is not half so dangerous as most people imagine. It is\r\nwell known that if we jump out of hot water into cold, we resist the\r\nshock, and bear the effects of the latter better than if we took the\r\nplunge without any preparation. But then there is a strong prejudice that\r\n_perspiration_ is an insuperable bar to the application of cold water to\r\nthe surface. If the individual has come into a state of perspiration from\r\nbodily exercise, and especially if he be fatigued or exhausted—then the\r\ncold water would be dangerous. But this is not the case, to any extent,\r\nwhen he is warmed either by the hot bath, or by the accumulation of\r\nheat generated in his own body. This is proved by authentic facts which\r\nhave come under my own observation. Forty years ago, when the Russian\r\ntroops were encamped in the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, the soldiers\r\nconstructed rude stone huts or ovens along the beech, for vapour baths.\r\nInto these they put stones, and heated them by fire, when they poured\r\nwater over them, and thus filled the hut with a dense vapour. When the\r\nmen had continued in this rude vapour-bath till they were in a state of\r\nperspiration, they leaped into the sea, and swam about till they were\r\ntired. All this was done, partly for health, partly for pleasure. It is\r\nwell-known to all northern travellers that the Russians are in the habit\r\nof steaming themselves in the vapour-baths, and then directly rolling\r\nthemselves in the snow. Every one, too, must have observed postillions\r\ndashing their foaming and perspiring horses into any convenient water at\r\nthe end of their journey, without the least fear of their animals being\r\ninjured by the dip.\r\n\r\nHere then is a complete counter-part, or rather prototype of the\r\nHYDRO-SUDO-PATHY, as already described. But there is one process which\r\nwill appear incredible to most people—that of procuring perspiration\r\nby means of blankets wetted with cold water. Let us see whether an\r\nillustration of this may not be found. Every one who has read the\r\nWaverly Novels must have been struck with the singular practice pursued\r\nby some Highlanders (outlaws I think) who were obliged to pass many\r\nwinter nights unsheltered on the freezing mountains. When they were\r\ndesirous of sleeping, they dipped their plaids in the freezing water of\r\nthe nearest pool or stream, and, wrapping themselves in this dripping\r\nand gelid mantle, went quietly to sleep! So long as the plaid kept wet,\r\nthe Highlander kept warm, and slept soundly; but the moment it got dry,\r\nthe man was awoke by the cold, and proceeded to the brook or stream\r\nto saturate his bed-clothes again with cold water. Here we have the\r\nprototype of the German process described in the case of the girl with\r\ninflamed lungs. By what process of _reasoning_ the Silesian peasant and\r\nthe Celtic mountaineer, arrived at the knowledge of these curious facts,\r\nwould be difficult to imagine. There was probably no reasoning in either\r\ncase, but chance, observation, and experience.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes more easy to explain a phenomenon when discovered, than\r\nto arrive at it by any process of reasoning previously. The wet plaid\r\nby confining the animal heat of the Highlander, soon occasioned a warm\r\natmosphere around his body, which kept him comfortable. But as soon\r\nas the plaid got dry and its texture _pervious_, then the animal heat\r\nrapidly escaped, and the feeling of cold dispelled sleep. In the case\r\nof pneumonia related by Dr. Weiss, the wet blanket was surmounted by\r\nseveral other blankets, which effectually prevented the escape of animal\r\nheat, which would soon accumulate and eventuate in perspiration. In such\r\ncases there would be a chill at first, succeeded by reaction, heat, and\r\ntranspiration. We see this exemplified every day, where cold lotions\r\nare applied to an inflamed part. If the clothes are defended from the\r\nexternal air, they soon become warm, and form a fomentation—whereas,\r\nif exposed to a current of air, they will almost freeze the part by\r\nevaporation. Dr. Weiss’s patient would never have perspired, if the wet\r\nblanket had not been covered by dry ones.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to glance at some other cases recorded by the\r\nprofessors of hydropathy.\r\n\r\nDr. Engin relates the following cases of catarrhal and rheumatic fever.\r\nA delicate female, aged 30 years, was taken ill on the 27th of April\r\n1837, with the abovementioned complaint, but was under an allopathic\r\ndoctor till the 30th, when Dr. E. found her labouring under acute pains\r\nin the joints—inflamed throat—difficulty of swallowing—joints swelled\r\nand red—inability to move—pulse 100. The patient was enveloped in a cold\r\nwet blanket, over which several dry ones were placed, twice a day, for\r\nthree days consecutively. She soon began to perspire copiously each time\r\nof application. On the fourth day she was plunged into a cold bath while\r\ndeluged with sweat. This was repeated twelve days in succession, the\r\ninflamed joints being kept, in the intervals, covered with cold wetted\r\ncloths. During all this time she was ordered to drink plenty of cold\r\nwater. The fever and all the other symptoms gradually diminished, and\r\nfinally disappeared. Towards the end of the treatment a critical eruption\r\nappeared on the skin.\r\n\r\nThis was certainly as unfavourable a case for the hydropathic treatment\r\nas could well be imagined; and the fact of its being put in practice,\r\neven with impunity, may afford matter for reflection.\r\n\r\nCases are detailed by Dr. Engin and others, where scarlatina, erysipelas,\r\nherpes, and other cutaneous eruptions, were treated on hydropathic\r\nprinciples, and seemingly with success. Hæmorrhages of various kinds,\r\nfrom nose, lungs, bowels, &c. are subjected to this treatment, as well\r\nas a host of chronic maladies, including constipation, hæmorrhoids,\r\namenorrhœa, chlorosis, liver complaints, jaundice, gout, rheumatism,\r\nmelancholia, hypochondriasis, hysteria, epilepsy, tic douloureux,\r\ngastrodynia, scrofula, rickets, &c.\r\n\r\nNow, although I should be far from recommending this practice in many\r\nof the complaints where it has been employed, yet, as the institutions\r\nfor the hydropathic treatment are now spread all over Germany, and open\r\nto the inspection of all medical men, (unlike the hocus-pocus fraud,\r\nmystery, and deception of homœopathy,) it would be unwise not to examine\r\ninto a system which shocks our prejudices rather than runs counter to\r\nhistorical facts and philosophical reasoning.\r\n\r\nAt all events, this system corroborates a practice which I have\r\nnow followed and publicly recommended for many years; namely, the\r\n“CALIDO-FRIGID SPONGING, or LAVATION.” This consists in sponging the\r\nface, throat, and upper part of the chest, night and morning, with _hot_\r\nwater, and then immediately with _cold_ water. I have also recommended\r\nthat children should be habituated to this sponging all over the body,\r\nas the means of inuring them to, and securing them from, the injuries\r\nproduced by atmospheric vicissitudes. It is the best preservative\r\nwhich I know against face-aches, tooth-aches, (hot and cold water\r\nbeing alternately used to rinse the mouth,) ear-aches, catarrhs, &c.\r\nso frequent and distressing in this country. But its paramount virtue\r\nis that of preserving many a constitution from pulmonary consumption,\r\nthe causes of which are often laid in repeated colds, and in the\r\nsusceptibility to atmospheric impressions.[47]\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST PILGRIMAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Second Pilgrimage.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMIN DE MER—CHEMIN DE FER.\r\n\r\nA short run of fourteen hours from the Tower, on a road as smooth as that\r\nof the Great Western Railway, deposited us safely at Ostende—a kind of\r\nflat and fortified Gravesend, where John Bull, as far as tongue and table\r\nare concerned, is as much at home as if he were in Deptford or Greenwich.\r\nAt six in the morning, every thing is bustle among the baggage, and\r\nit requires half a dozen omnibuses to convey travellers, trunks,\r\nclothes-bags and band-boxes from the hotels to the station. And here I\r\nwould advise every passenger to mark the _destination_ on every package,\r\nand take care of the receipt ticket, otherwise he may find, on his\r\narrival at Brussels, Liege, or Antwerp, that his luggage has travelled to\r\nquite a different quarter, requiring a “reclamation” to be sent along the\r\nlines, and perhaps two or three days’ delay! One of my trunks, and that\r\ntoo, the one containing the “sinews of war,” was “absent without leave,”\r\nwhen I reached Brussels, and was afterwards found lying in the office at\r\nGhent!\r\n\r\nShort as was our passage to the Station by the OMNIBUS, it gave rise to a\r\nwarm discussion respecting this very convenient and economical vehicle,\r\nwhich was considered by one of the party as a great recent improvement on\r\nhackneys, cabs, and stage-coaches. An Irish Tutor, however, who was one\r\nof the company, maintained that the OMNIBUS was in common use more than\r\ntwo thousand years ago, in every country between the banks of the Ganges\r\nand the pillars of Hercules. This was so startling an assertion that the\r\ngentleman was called on for proof. “That I will give,” said he, “from the\r\ntenth Satire of Juvenal, which commences thus:”—\r\n\r\n    “OMNIBUS in terris quæ sunt à gadibus usque\r\n    Auroram et gangem.”——\r\n\r\nThe cockneys stared at each other, and one or two gentlemen laughed most\r\nimmoderately. The DOMINE proceeded to translate the passage for the\r\nbenefit of the ladies, and others who might not possess a knowledge of\r\nthe dead languages.\r\n\r\n“_Omnibus in terris_” there are OMNIBUSES in all countries, “_quæ sunt_,”\r\nthat lie, “_a gadibus_,” between Cadiz, “_auroram et gangem_” and the\r\nbanks of the Ganges.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious distortion of the celebrated passage in Juvenal, was\r\ndelivered with such assumed gravity and apparent honesty, that it carried\r\nconviction to nine-tenths of the passengers, and those few who detected\r\nthe sophistry, were so much pleased with the joke, that they applauded\r\nthe learning of the Theban. Nor would it have been very easy to prove\r\nthat he was _literally_ wrong. “OMNIBUS” was in use wherever the latin\r\nlanguage prevailed; and though not specifically designed as a vehicle\r\nfor _passengers and luggage_, it was employed to carry _all kinds of\r\nthings_—hence the application of it to the modern and very useful Noah’s\r\nArk on four wheels.\r\n\r\nA good deal of scepticism has been expressed respecting the “flying\r\nDutchman” of the novelist and others. But I do not see why we should\r\nnot have a “flying Dutchman,” seeing that we have “flying Belgians.”\r\nIf, in the good old times of Marlbro’, Napoleon, and Wellington, a\r\ntrain of artillery moving at the rate of ten or twelve miles an hour,\r\nwas called a _“flying” train_, surely a train going at the rate of\r\ntwenty-five or thirty miles an hour, and carrying a small army with its\r\nbaggage on its back, deserves the epithet of a “_flying train_.” Never\r\nwas country better calculated for rail-roads than a great portion of\r\nHolland and Belgium. You have only to lay down sleepers and rails in\r\nany direction, and all is ready for the engine. Nor is there any extra\r\nexpence required for guarding man or beast against accidents. The train\r\nbrushes along the sides or gable of a cottage—dashes through the centre\r\nof a village—plunges through the suburbs of a city—skips over a public\r\nroad without disturbing a stone of the pavé—darts over a canal—and all\r\nwith scarcely a rail or fence to prevent intrusion on the lines. The\r\nBelgians are either very cautious, or very reckless of life. You will\r\nsee men, women, and children standing or sitting within six feet of the\r\ntrains; but no accident seems ever to occur. As for cattle straying on\r\nthe rail-roads, there is little danger of that; for you may travel from\r\nOstende to Liege, without seeing ox or ass, cow or calf, sheep or goat—or\r\nanything with four legs—except in the towns. All is corn, hay, potatoes,\r\nand clover—or clover, potatoes, hay and corn—or some combination of these\r\nfour staple articles.\r\n\r\nBut neither rail-roads nor love are found to run always smooth. As we\r\napproach Liege the ground becomes so rugged, and the hills so steep, that\r\ntunnels of prodigious length and depth are necessary to complete the\r\nline to Liege, Aix, and Cologne. It is said the Americans contemplate a\r\nperforation of the Allighany Mountains, in order that rail-roads may be\r\nextended to Kentucky. The task will not be much less difficult to connect\r\nOstende with the Rhine. But the persevering industry of Germans—the\r\n“improbus labor”—will conquer all obstructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTWERP ROUTE.\r\n\r\nWhile the train is flying along between Brussels and Liege, let us glance\r\nat the Antwerp route. It is generally preferred to that of Ostende—though\r\nfor what good reason I am ignorant. The land is surely more natural to\r\nman than the water. True the difference between the two routes consists\r\nchiefly in the length of the river voyage; but, of all the navigations\r\nwhich I have ever experienced round this globe, the “NAVIGATION OF THE\r\nSCHELDT,” is amongst the most insipid and monotonous. To me, too, it\r\nrecalled scenes the most triste, and reminiscences the most dolorous.\r\nThe very lapse of time itself (31 years) since I first anathematized its\r\nmalodorous and malarious banks, is not a very pleasing retrospect. But\r\nthe recollection of what passed there in 1809, can never be called up\r\nwithout pain and mortification!\r\n\r\nWhile the steamer was ploughing her weary way between Flushing and\r\nCadsand, MEMORY, that mysterious power, quickly reproduced the drama,\r\non which the curtain had fallen for more than thirty years! The hundred\r\npendants floating in the air—the masses of troops, whose polished arms\r\ngleamed in the sun—the frowning and hostile ramparts and batteries on\r\neach side of the pass covered with thousands of soldiers and citizens—the\r\ndaring rush of three men-of-war (in one of which, the VALIANT of\r\nseventy-four guns, I then was,) into the Scheldt, while shells were\r\nbursting over us, and the heavy shot whistling through our rigging—the\r\ndebarkation of the British troops—the bombarding and battering of\r\nFlushing—the conflagration of the town—the sorties of the garrison,\r\nrepulsed, scattered, and driven back by British bayonets, as quickly and\r\ncertainly as the Ocean’s surge is shivered into foam by the perpendicular\r\nrocks—the devastation of the ramparts by the showers of shot and shells\r\nfor ever thundering against them—the awful preparation for storm—the\r\ncapitulation of the garrison;—all these and many other scenes rose on the\r\nintellectual mirror, and flitted round the mental diorama, as fresh as\r\nwhen they were first spread before the material eye.\r\n\r\nThen came the still darker side of the drama, on which Memory, even yet\r\nshudders to dwell! Our hopes and expectations scattered on the winds—the\r\ngreat object of the Expedition (French fleet) secured beyond our reach,\r\nthough before our eyes—while our luxurious commander was employed in\r\neating turtle and throwing the _shells_ at the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe stimulus of action, the expectation of booty, and the prospect of\r\nbattle being withdrawn, vexation and disappointment prepared the way\r\nfor the deadly poison of malaria. Now came the “foul fiend of the fens”\r\nin a hundred horrid forms; and, like a destroying angel, mowed down the\r\nranks of our legions, lingering on these pestiferous plains in disgust or\r\ndespair! Happy were they who fell victims, at once, to the destructive\r\nagent. Many of those who survived the endemic, were harassed to their\r\ndying days by repeated attacks of the Walcheren malady.\r\n\r\nYet, on both sides of the river, the country is a luxurious\r\ngarden,—teeming, equally, with the necessaries of life and the seeds of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city of Antwerp itself is worthy of a visit, there being numerous\r\npaintings by the Flemish masters of the art, while the citadel calls\r\nforth exciting recollections of valiant assaults, and equally gallant\r\ndefences.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIEGE.\r\n\r\nLiege is quite metamorphosed—revolutionised—or, more properly speaking,\r\n_Cockrellized_—within the last twenty years. In times of war, it\r\npresented a picture of peace—and now, in times of peace, it exhibits the\r\nbustle of war. It is no longer the quiet abode of burghers, as in the\r\ndays of Quentin Durward! In every direction you observe tall chimnies\r\nbelching forth volumes of dense smoke—forges roaring—steam-engines\r\nsobbing hammers clattering—and files grating—all in the preparation and\r\nconstruction of various kinds of destructive weapons, from a 42-pounder\r\nto a pitchfork! Liege, in fact, is now the Brumagem of Belgium, and\r\ncan rival the great British manufactory of metals in no small degree.\r\nMusket-barrels can be procured at Liege for three shillings each! Let\r\nEngland look to her corn-laws! The “factory system” has not greatly\r\nimproved the manners, habits, or morals of Liege. Those who have not\r\nvisited this place for ten or fifteen years are astonished at the\r\ndifference among the lower order of the people.\r\n\r\nThe country around Liege, and between that city and Aix and Spa, is\r\nmagnificent—equal in beauty, cultivation, and fertility, to the finest\r\nparts of Devonshire—or indeed of any other shire in England. Unlike\r\nFrance and many parts of the Continent, the country here is spangled with\r\nhandsome villas and neat cottages in every direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUDE FONTAINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout six miles from Liege, on the road to Spa, most beautifully\r\nsituate, lies the little warm spring of the above name. The waters are\r\nlimpid, inodorous, and tasteless. The temperature is 90½° of Fahrenheit.\r\nThe specific gravity is that of common water. It contains small\r\nquantities of carbonic, sulphuric, and muriatic acid, and also some lime.\r\nOne hundred pints of this spring yielded 240 grains of saline matters—of\r\nwhich 88 were common salt—91 carbonate of lime—14 sulphate of lime—15\r\nmuriate of magnesia—12 alumine—and 15 silice. They are, therefore, very\r\nanalogous to the waters of Pfeffers, Wildbad, and Schlangenbad—and may\r\nbe used for the same purposes as their more celebrated contemporaries.\r\nThey may be reached in nine or ten hours from Ostende, by the rail-road.\r\nA young lady from England, who bathed in these waters once, and sometimes\r\ntwice a day, remarked that she always “felt like eel” after leaving them,\r\nand throughout the same day. I do not exactly know what the “eel-feel”\r\nis, but I can easily believe that it is not precisely that which the eel\r\nitself experiences when it changes its mud-bath for the hands of the cook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPA.\r\n\r\n    “Heureux qui s’ecartant des sentiers d’ici bas,\r\n    A l’ombre du desert allant cacher ses pas.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThirty miles South of AIX-LA-CHAPELLE, and twenty-four South-east\r\nof Liege, embosomed in a sombre but rather romantic valley of the\r\nArdennes, lies SPA, formerly one of the most aristocratic and celebrated\r\nchalybeates of Europe.\r\n\r\nWe proceed from Liege to Spa along the valley of the Vesdre, and a more\r\nbeautiful drive can hardly be met with. I do not think it inferior to the\r\nbanks of the Meuse, and it certainly is much more _beautiful_ than many\r\nparts of the Rhine. The sides of the valley are clothed with wood, or\r\ncultivated carefully, from their very summits, and studded with beautiful\r\nvillas, cottages, and hamlets, in all directions. At every winding, we\r\nsee hundreds of men at work, carrying the new rail-road over rivers and\r\nthrough the solid rock.\r\n\r\n“Cette route charmante decouvre à chaque detour de ravissants vallons qui\r\nlaissant aperçevoir au loin des maisons de plaisance, de vieux chateaux,\r\net de riants villages. Les cotes escarpées des montagnes qui en dessinent\r\nles sinuositées parsemées d’arbres, de rochers, et de precipices.”\r\n\r\nAt the village of Pepinsterre, about sixteen miles from Liege, we quit\r\nthe Aix-la-Chapelle road, and turn up to the right. The whole way from\r\nthis to Spa is a constant ascent, the air becoming more bracing, and the\r\nscenery more wild, or of the Ardennes-forest character, till we approach\r\nthe town through a triple avenue, the centre one a pavé, and the side\r\nones for walking or riding. Spa itself lies in a very picturesque dell,\r\nthe eastern side of which is very abrupt, and covered with wood. The\r\nhouses are all white and clean, and the locale, altogether, pleased me\r\nmore than almost any spa I had previously visited.\r\n\r\nYet the place is comparatively abandoned! We saw very few English there,\r\nand up to the 23d July, 1840, only about a thousand names were entered on\r\nthe books, many, perhaps most, of whom were casual visitors, or merely\r\npassengers to other spas! I fear the good citizens of Spa will not erect\r\na statue to Sir Francis Head.\r\n\r\nA catalogue of the emperors, kings, queens, princes, and nobility of all\r\ngrades (laying aside the gentry and bureaucracy) who have lined their\r\nribs with steel, and tanned their slender chylopoietics in the Pouhon or\r\nGeronsterre, would fill a volume. Our countrymen bear a conspicuous part\r\nin this roll of worthies. Henry the Third, of France, visited Spa in the\r\nsixteenth century—in the same, Charles Stuart, having lost his kingdom,\r\nrepaired to Spa to regain his health. In 1717, PETER THE GREAT drank the\r\nwaters of the Pouhon and Geronsterre—in one single year, (1783,) the list\r\nof princes, dukes, and princesses, alone, amounted to 33, besides the\r\nhosts of inferior gentry.\r\n\r\nThe following history of one of our countrymen, recorded by HENRY DE\r\nSTEERS, the Sydenham of Spa, is not a little curious:—“In 1620, arrived\r\nhere a Milord Anglais, accompanied by his medical attendant. The\r\nCollege of Physicians in London, who had been consulted in this case,\r\ninstead of putting Milord into a strait-waistcoat—or, at all events,\r\nunder surveillance, recommended him to the care of De Steers, at Spa.\r\nThis unfortunate gentleman laboured under monomania of three distinct\r\nforms, which attacked him periodically, and in succession. During the\r\nfirst ten days of every month, he neither ate, nor drank, nor spoke. He\r\nkept to his room all the time. On the eleventh morning he would rise\r\nfrom his bed early, go out a hunting, and come home hungry, eating and\r\ndrinking enormously. This was his occupation during the second decade of\r\nthe month. In the third decade, the scene entirely changed. He became\r\npassionately fond of music, and squandered hundreds upon the squallini’s\r\nof that day. At the end of the month the taciturnity and fasting, &c.\r\nreturned.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that De Steers, being unable to prevail on\r\nthe monomaniac to drink the Spa waters, the patient returned to England,\r\nand became a furious and confirmed maniac.\r\n\r\n“As soon,” says Dr. Dordonville, “as the roads to Spa were rendered\r\npassable, the English, travellers by disposition, and great admirers\r\nof the picturesque, thronged to the fountains, and filled the town by\r\ntheir magnificence. They loved to expend their riches; and those, whose\r\nenergetic passions threw them into dissipation, introduced a fatal and\r\nruinous luxury.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the caprice of fashion, and the attractions of other\r\nwatering-places have damaged Spa, it is still resorted to by many people\r\nof this country, and great numbers from France, Belgium, and Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUHON.\r\n\r\nThis is the most ancient of the springs. It is situated in the middle\r\nof the town, surrounded by a marble basin, whence is bottled immense\r\nquantities of the waters for France, England, Holland, and Germany.\r\nSteers, who practised here for twenty-five years, is not behind his\r\nbrethren of the spas, in his eulogies of the Pouhon waters. “They have\r\nan agreeable tartness, and have worked many miracles. Their effects are\r\nall but supernatural, and have excited the curiosity and admiration of\r\nphysicians and philosophers who have come here from various countries.”\r\n\r\nIt is very clear when received into a glass, which becomes covered on the\r\nsides with bubbles of air, that also rise on the surface. The acidulous\r\nand piquant taste is succeeded by a smack of steel. On standing for\r\nsome time there is a deposition of iron at the bottom of the glass, in\r\nconsequence of the disengagement of carbonic acid. Peter the Great, who\r\ncame here exhausted, and menaced with dropsy, completely recovered—and\r\nhis statue stands over the Pouhon as no mean certificate of the medicinal\r\npowers of the spring.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND SOURCE, SAUVENIERE, is half a league out of the town, and\r\nsituated in a romantic spot. This spa contains less iron than the Pouhon,\r\nand used to precede the others in drinking.\r\n\r\nThe GERONSTERRE was known to DE STEERS. It is to the south of the town,\r\nbut now of easy access by a beautiful road. This spring disengages some\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas, which distinguishes it from the others.\r\n\r\nThe TONNELET is situated between the Pouhon and Sauveniere, and has three\r\nsprings, all of the same quality.\r\n\r\n_Constituents of One Gallon (231 Cubic Inches)._\r\n\r\n  +-----------+------+--------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+\r\n  |           |Carb.-|Solid   |Muriate|Carbonate|Carbonate|Oxide |       |\r\n  | SOURCES.  |Acid  |Matters.|  of   |   of    |   of    | of   |Temper-|\r\n  |           |Gas.  |        | Soda. |  Soda.  |  Lime.  |Iron. |ature. |\r\n  |           |Cub.  |Grains  |Grains | Grains  | Grains  |Grains|       |\r\n  |           |Inch. |        |       |         |         |      |       |\r\n  +-----------+------+--------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+\r\n  |POUHON     | 262  | 27     |   1   |   2¼    |   9     |  5¼  | 50°F. |\r\n  |GERONSTERRE| 168  | 12½    |    ½  |   1½    |   5¼    |  1   | 49°   |\r\n  |SAUVENIERE | 241  |  8½    |    ¼  |    ½    |   3¾    |  2¼  | 49°   |\r\n  |TONNELET   | 280  |  5½    |  ..   |  ..     |   1½    |  2¾  | 49°   |\r\n  +-----------+------+--------+-------+---------+---------+------+-------+\r\n\r\nFrom the above it will be seen that iron and large quantity of carbonic\r\nacid gas are the main ingredients in the spa waters—and consequently that\r\nthey are simple chalybeates—without aperient qualities.\r\n\r\nSuperb baths have been erected near the Pouhon, for the accommodation of\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL AGENCY.\r\n\r\nM. Dordonville is the most recent author on the Spa waters, as he has\r\nresided there for many years, on account of his own health. According\r\nto him, the first perceptible effect of drinking the Spa waters,\r\nespecially if taken on an empty stomach, is a slight affection of the\r\nhead resembling that which results from taking champaign. Four or five\r\nglasses suffice to produce this phenomenon, especially at first. As this\r\narises from the carbonic acid gas, it is very transitory. This abundance\r\nof gas renders these waters very pleasant to drink, but they are far\r\nfrom agreeable when the gas has escaped—and they are then less easy of\r\ndigestion. Hence the bottled waters are far less efficacious than at\r\nthe sources. Since the mania of Broussais, it has not been uncommon\r\nfor French visitors to take the waters mixed with gum Arabic, by which\r\nprecious mess the springs were rendered nauseous and indigestible. We may\r\nagree with Dr. Dordonville that the action of Spa waters is not confined\r\nto the stomach, but extends to various organs with which the stomach is\r\nbound in sympathy. This applies to debility of the digestive organs and\r\nits consequences; but we must be cautious how we employ this chalybeate\r\nwhere there are any obstructions or engorgements of other viscera, merely\r\nbecause they are diuretic, and promote absorption. Both De Steers of\r\nold, and Monsr. Dordonville, of the present day, assure us that these\r\nwaters require to be taken in large doses, and for a considerable time,\r\notherwise they will do harm instead of good. “Those who cannot take them\r\nin this manner ought to desist from taking them at all.” Mons. D. has\r\nseen many people who have taken from 300 to 350 ounces of the waters\r\ndaily. PETER THE GREAT generally took twenty-one glasses (three ounces\r\neach) every morning. Dr. D. however, wisely leaves it to the feelings of\r\nthe patient, how many goblets he daily takes.\r\n\r\nThese waters have been found very beneficial in chronic diarrhœa, as\r\nmight indeed be expected; but _large quantities_ of any liquid taken\r\nin such cases, are detrimental, especially when conjoined with the\r\npedestrian exercises that are recommended. We can hardly subscribe to the\r\ndoctrine that these chalybeates are beneficial in obstructions of the\r\nliver, and enlargments of the spleen—especially the former, considering\r\nthat they have no aperient quality. The same observation applies to\r\nenlargement of the mesenteric glands.\r\n\r\nOn the kidneys they have an evident action, and DE STEERS, the Sydenham\r\nof his day, calls them _vesical_.\r\n\r\n“The waters of Spa remove heat of the kidneys and bladder, and expel\r\ngravel more effectually than any other remedy.”\r\n\r\nOne of the most general effects of these waters is an increase of\r\nappetite, and most patients acquire flesh as well as strength under their\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, to people of pallid complexions—leucophlegmatic\r\nconstitutions—and general debility, without organic disease, that these\r\nwaters may be very useful. The pallid female, affected with complaints\r\npeculiar to the sex, may expect to acquire a healthy complexion, and\r\ngeneral strength from the waters of Spa, assisted by mountain air and\r\ndaily exercise. Sterility is one of the many maladies for which they are\r\nloudly praised by the resident physicians.\r\n\r\nThe sulphuretted chalybeate of the Geronsterre is recommended by Dr.\r\nD. in tuberculous affections of the lungs—a recommendation which needs\r\nconfirmation, as the Americans say.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIMEN.\r\n\r\nM. Dordonville remarks that no small portion of those who come to Spa,\r\ndo so for pleasure, and not for health. These may eat and drink and\r\nexercise as they would at home. But the invalid must pursue a systematic\r\nregimen. The ancients always recommended aperient medicine previously to\r\ntaking mineral waters—and even De Steers made a point of giving a gentle\r\npurgative to his patients every eight or ten days. The horror of opening\r\nmedicine entertained by people on the continent, medical men and all, is\r\nproductive of infinite mischief, when chalybeate waters, and all those\r\nnot aperient, are used. M. Dordonville cautions the drinkers of Spa very\r\nstrongly against exposure to cold—a necessary advice in a mountainous\r\nregion, where vicissitudes of temperature are frequent. The waters are\r\nbest taken early in the morning fasting; or before meals. Some people\r\ndrink them at their meals, without injury. Most of the inhabitants of Spa\r\nhave no other beverage. In affections of the chest they may be mixed with\r\nmilk—especially those of the Geronsterre. M. Dordonville considers the\r\nSpring as the best season for the waters of Spa, and regrets that tyrant\r\nfashion prevents invalids from coming to these waters till the middle\r\nof Summer, or even till Autumn. From five to fifteen minutes’ interval\r\nbetween the glasses is to be observed, with exercise during that time.\r\nHe recommends a light breakfast to be taken at the fountains, after the\r\nwaters, where delicious milk, fresh eggs, good butter, and bread can\r\nalways be had. From twenty to forty, or even sixty days are necessary for\r\na complete course of the waters. The same physician cautions us against\r\ncompound dishes or the least approach to repletion while taking the Spa.\r\n“The great rock on which patients split is the pleasures of the table.”\r\n\r\nThe environs of Spa are very picturesque, and even romantic—the rides and\r\npromenades being extensive and varied in this mountainous region. The\r\nrailway from Ostende or Antwerp takes the invalid or visitor to within\r\ntwenty-four miles of the Spa, and will soon take him within six miles of\r\nthe town: and therefore the place may be reached on the third day from\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nSpringing from my couch at five o’clock, in the morning after my arrival,\r\nI first drank a large tumbler of the Pouhon, and started up the mountain\r\nfor the Geronsterre. The ascent is constant and rather steep; but the\r\nmountain air gave me fresh vigour, and I reached the fountain (three\r\nmiles) without the slightest fatigue. It is prettily situated in a kind\r\nof pleasure-ground, with shaded walks and pleasant benches for promenade\r\nor repose, while taking the waters. The water itself did not convey\r\nto my olfactory nerves that decided odour of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nwhich Dr. Dordonville maintains it does. It certainly tastes somewhat\r\ndifferent from the Pouhon, and they urge you to swallow it quickly, lest\r\nthe malodorous gas should escape. It was in vain that I told the Nymph\r\nof the Spring that I was not sick, but only drinking the waters from\r\ncuriosity. Still she urged, and so did some of the drinkers, that the\r\nmost precious ingredient would vanish into air, if I did not gulp it down\r\nin an instant: I now took an eastern road over the brow of the mountain,\r\nthrough a wild forest, but along a good road, and reached the SAUVENIERE,\r\nafter a long walk of nearly three miles. Here I quaffed at the source\r\nwhence the Duchess of —— imbibed new life, or at least renovated health,\r\nand hung up her votive tablet, in the shape of a dome and colonnade, in\r\ngratitude to the fountain and its tutelar saint, Apollo. It tasted to my\r\npalate much more inky than its neighbour the Geronsterre, as, indeed, it\r\nought to do, having more than double the quantity of iron, and nearly\r\nhalf as much as the Pouhon.\r\n\r\nFrom thence I turned down a narrow road to the TONNELET, about a mile\r\ndistant from the Sauveniere. It was the briskest of them all, to my\r\npalate, containing more carbonic acid gas than even the Pouhon. The\r\nchalybeate taste was very marked, and the water, upon the whole, very\r\npleasant. By this time I had swallowed four large tumblers of mineral\r\nwater, and walked seven miles before breakfast, which was very well for\r\nthe first morning. I experienced no sensation whatever about my head,\r\nnor any other than a sense of fulness in the stomach, and very little\r\nappetite. Another walk of more than a mile to the town, dissipated the\r\nsense of fulness and brought me an excellent appetite, which was again\r\nremoved by eggs, coutelets, potatoes, and coffee, at the hotel de Pays\r\nBas. After breakfast, the pedestrian exercise was again resumed, and the\r\nheights to the eastward of the town, with all their devious and intricate\r\npaths, were carefully explored. The views from these heights are various\r\nand beautiful—the air delicate and exhilarating. Descending to the town,\r\nand resting half an hour, I repaired to the bathing establishment, close\r\nto the Pouhon, and ordered a mineral water bath, at a temperature of\r\n98°. I found that the bath-master trusted entirely to his hand, for the\r\nregulation of temperature, and on testing this “rule of thumb” by the\r\nthermometer, he had only made a mistake of six degrees, the instrument\r\nexhibiting 104°, instead of 98°. This, however, is very common at all\r\nbathing places. The chalybeate bath produced in me no other sensations\r\nthan those arising from saline or plain baths elsewhere. The carbonic\r\nacid was all gone, and the water tasted merely mawkish. It has very\r\nlittle of the stimulating effects of the Wisbaden or other potent waters.\r\nAlthough I did not rise from the bath “rajeuné comme un Phœnix,” I\r\nexperienced great refreshment after twelve miles’ walking-exercise, and\r\nrepaired to the three o’clock table-d’hôte in the PAYS BAS, with more\r\nnatural appetite than I had felt since leaving Modern Babylon. A siesta\r\nof an hour after dinner was equally pleasant and salubrious. After some\r\nramblings about the town, a visit to the Redout finished the day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe magnificent “grande salle” in this splendid edifice, was occupied\r\nwith the ball, while the “DÆMON-ROBBER bands” were plying their vocation\r\nat the end of the room. The play, however, seemed to go on languidly;\r\nand the waltz appeared to have more attractions for the company than the\r\nroulette. The dancers and spectators were by no means _distinguée_. There\r\nwas not one fine woman in the room. We did not distinguish more than\r\nhalf a dozen English in the whole assembly. They were almost all French,\r\nFlemish, and a few Germans.\r\n\r\nThus ended a SPA-DAY in the Ardennes. I do not recommend an imitation\r\nof it to all those who go to Spa for health. But if the pedestrian\r\nexercise were superseded by equestrian or carriage exercise, I think a\r\nmore effectual plan for the recovery of health could hardly be devised.\r\nTo those who are very delicate, the paths that are cut along the face of\r\nthe wooded precipices overhanging the town, afford most beautiful walks,\r\nsheltered from the winds, and commanding pleasing prospects of Ardennes\r\nscenery. The air there is bracing and elastic.\r\n\r\nIt is not likely that such a “HAVEN OF HEALTH” as this is, should be\r\nwithout its Cursaal, or gambling-table. The two grand hells are the\r\nRedout and the Vauxhall. A few years before the Revolution the Church\r\nsustained some damage in slander by these mansions of morality. It\r\nappears that the Bishop of Liege, who united a temporal with an eternal\r\nconcern for the souls of the good citizens, had granted a monopoly of\r\nfifty years gambling to the proprietors of the Redout—of course without\r\nany other consideration than the advancement of religion and the good of\r\nthe people. But a rival establishment (Vauxhall) having been started,\r\nthe Bishop issued an ordonnance against the new tables, as not being\r\northodox. An appeal was made to the legislature, and the holy canon was\r\nreversed, on the principle that, as in a free state like that of Liege,\r\n“every man had a right to do as he liked with his own”—and as gambling\r\nwas not contrary to law, so the Bishop had no right to grant a monopoly\r\nto gamblers. This was an awkward affair; but an amicable arrangement\r\nwas soon made between the Bishop and the proprietors of the two hells,\r\nby which the man of God modestly declined a tenth of the spoil, and\r\nonly accepted a _third_ of the profits of the tables at the end of each\r\nseason! “Le PRINCE EVEQUE recevra le tiers DES BENEFICES que se feront\r\ndans ces deux maisons sur les jeux, apres la saison des Eaux.”\r\n\r\nIn this way things went on smoothly for a while; when lo! a third CURSAAL\r\nraised its lofty head to share the spoils of hazard with the noble firm\r\nof “BISHOP, REDOUT, and VAUXHALL.” This was too much for the conscience\r\nof M. L’EVEQUE. He justly considered that two royal roads to the regions\r\nof his “FRIEND IN BLACK” were amply sufficient—and that to open a third\r\nwould only be adding another facility to the already “_faciles descensus\r\nAverni_.” He therefore sent a file of “gens-d’armes” to turn the tables\r\non these scoffers at the holy command of their Bishop, which led to wars\r\nand bloodshed. The Bishop, finding his palace of Liege rather warm for\r\nhim, appealed to the Emperor of Germany—or rather to Prince Metternich,\r\nthen at Coblentz. Metternich decided in favour of the original hells, as\r\nbeing under the benediction of the Bishop, or perhaps of the Pope—and\r\ntherefore incapable of doing any thing inconsistent with the orthodox\r\nreligion! Soon after this, Metternich and his master had more important\r\ngames to play in the French Revolution, and how Mons. LEVOZ, the\r\nunfortunate proprietor of the new Cursaal fared, this deponent knoweth\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nSpas are under the dominion of more influences than fashion. Who could\r\nhave supposed that the medicinal virtues of mineral waters should be\r\ndeteriorated or even destroyed by POLITICS. Yet such is the case. While\r\nHolland and Belgium were under one crown, the Dutch dolls flocked\r\nannually in great numbers to paint their cheeks in the Pouhon or\r\nGeronsterre, returning to their dykes with a cargo of steel that secured\r\nthem, for ten months, against the damps and debilities of their vapoury\r\natmosphere. But no sooner had the “Braves Belges” revolted, than the\r\nchalybeates of Spa lost all their efficacy, and grass is now likely to\r\ngrow, and water to run in the streets of this celebrated place! The Dutch\r\nand most of the English at present resort to the Brunnens of Nassau—the\r\nchalybeates of Brucknau—or the boiling Sprudel, for that health and\r\nrenovation which they used to seek and obtain in the forest of the\r\nArdennes!\r\n\r\nIt would be equally useless and impertinent in me to attempt a revulsion\r\nin the tide of spa-goers; yet, when I reflect on the locality of Spa—its\r\nfacility of access (forty-eight hours from London)—the efficacy of\r\nits waters—the salubrity of its air—the variety of its promenades and\r\ndrives—the excellence of its hotels—the cheapness of living—and the\r\nseclusion which is attainable by all—I cannot help regretting that\r\nfashion, caprice, or some inexplicable spell should turn the tide of\r\nBritish invalids so completely from SPA, and impel it with irresistible\r\nimpetus towards the BRUNNENS of GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIX-LA-CHAPELLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntiquity is to a city what noble blood is to an individual. The _former_\r\nmay fall into decay, and the _latter_ into poverty; but the pride of\r\nancestry supports them both in their fallen greatness. The Romans had\r\nexcellent olfactories, and a keen scent for steam or sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen gas, wherever these issued through cracks or fissures of the\r\nearth, in their wide domains. They were very fond of warm baths—and very\r\nwisely made frequent use of them with no small advantage, considering\r\nthat these Lords of the Creation had no linen shirts, and wore thick\r\nwoollen, and probably somewhat greasy garments next the skin. The\r\nboiling cauldron under Aix poured forth its nauseous and malodorous\r\nbroth as freely when Cæsar was mustering his legions on the banks of the\r\nRhine, or when Charlemagne, many a century afterwards, was uniting his\r\nFranco-German subjects in the same place, as now, when the “DAMPSCHIPPE”\r\nand “CHEMIN DE FER” are daily bringing hundreds of customers and guests\r\nfrom the distant shores of Albion and Erin. Innumerable Roman relics are\r\nhere found—and actual baths were discovered, where the brother of Nero\r\nprobably bathed.\r\n\r\nAix is situated in latitude 50° in the midst of a gentle valley,\r\nenvironed, at some distance, by well-wooded hills. The substratum is\r\ncalcareous, but there are unequivocal marks of volcanic agency in the\r\nneighbourhood. The town, like London, presents an old city environed by\r\na new one—especially towards the Borcette. The old town, in which almost\r\nall the hotels, and indeed the baths are situated, is very irregular, and\r\ncedes to few continental cities in the roughness of its pavements.\r\n\r\nThe FONTAINE ELISÉE, the chief or only place for drinking the waters, is\r\nsituated exactly between the old and new towns, close to the theatre,\r\nand is one of the handsomest places of the kind amongst the spas of\r\nGermany—forming a remarkable contrast with the Hygeian fonts of Ems,\r\nWisbaden, and Baden-Baden. In the midst of the façade, 270 feet in\r\nlength, rises the rotunda (resembling the Temple of Vesta at Rome)\r\nnearly fifty feet in height, supported by columns, flanked by two open\r\ncolonnades ending in cafées, and fronted by a promenade among trees. The\r\nfountain, from which issue two streams, is situated ten or twelve feet\r\nbelow the colonnade, at the bottom of two flights of marble steps—one\r\nfor descending to the font, and the other for ascending from it. There\r\nis ample space in front of the fountain for slowly bibbing the fervid\r\nspring. The whole is surmounted by a marble bust of Hygeia—taken from\r\na German Princess—and certainly exhibiting more benignity of mein than\r\nbeauty of feature. The two High Priests who fill the glasses from the\r\ntwo streams, have no _sinecure_ of it from six till eight o’clock every\r\nmorning. I counted 300 drinkers the first morning—and then, being tired,\r\nI counted no more. It must be the reputation, and not the taste or\r\nflavour of these waters, that draws such multitudes of invalids to them\r\nevery year. The odour of sulphur is exceedingly strong—the temperature\r\n129° Fahrenheit—the taste most nauseous—exactly resembling the washings\r\nof a gun-barrel, with a dash of rotten eggs. It is astonishing how soon\r\nthe palate and olfactories get reconciled to these and other malodorous\r\nwaters. On the second morning I felt little or no repugnance to them.\r\nThey are clear as crystal.\r\n\r\nThe best baths are at the HOTEL DE L’EMPEREUR (where the superior and\r\nhottest source is found), and which is also a very good hotel. The maitre\r\n(Mr. Nuellens) is a pleasant fellow, who speaks English, and is very\r\nattentive to his guests.\r\n\r\nAs Aix-la-Chapelle is not a place of resort for those who seek pleasure\r\nonly, the great body of the real visitors are really invalids, or think\r\nthemselves such. The few attendants on sick friends are seldom seen\r\ntaking either the waters or baths.\r\n\r\nAt such a place the experienced eye of the physician can detect, with a\r\ntolerable approach to accuracy, the prevailing maladies for the removal\r\nof which these waters are employed. The drinkers can readily be divided\r\ninto three, if not four classes. 1st. I observed a certain proportion,\r\nchiefly females—perhaps a twentieth or thirtieth part of the whole,—who\r\nwere clearly “malades imaginaires”—and whose complexions, features,\r\ngait, voices, and condition of body, evinced the absence of all organic\r\ndisease, or even functional disorder, of any consequence. They appeared,\r\nhowever, to be full as anxious to imbibe the prescribed quantity of this\r\nterrible compound of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, muriate of soda and a few\r\nother salts, as any of their neighbours, who shewed too evident marks of\r\ncorporeal sufferings.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND CLASS—and by far the most numerous—were those whose\r\ncountenances and tout-ensemble indicated the presence of various\r\nfunctional disorders—more especially stomach complaints, biliary\r\nobstructions, cutaneous affections, and uterine derangements. A large\r\nproportion of these were likely to benefit from the sulphur salines of\r\nAix. The THIRD CLASS could not be mistaken. The melancholy sequences of\r\napoplectic attacks (paralysis)—swelled limbs—dropsical effusions of the\r\nbody—jaundice,—enlarged livers and spleens—diseases of the heart—last\r\nstages of indigestion—kidney diseases—panting asthma—hectic cough—in\r\nshort, the long black catalogue of organic diseases, which no waters but\r\nthose of oblivion could ever wash away.\r\n\r\nYet hope, which clings to the human heart, had collected this unfortunate\r\nclass—and not in very small numbers—round the fountain and the baths—to\r\nreturn to their homes with blighted expectations, there to linger out a\r\nwretched existence!\r\n\r\nThe German physicians appear to be convinced that mineral springs are\r\nnot merely waters impregnated with various mineral and gaseous matters,\r\nwith or without increase of temperature; but that they are possessed of\r\n_vitality_—living beings, in fact, whose life is transfused into the\r\nhuman organism, thereby communicating energy to the solids and purity\r\nto the fluids of our bodies—in other words, correcting and expelling\r\ndisease and restoring health! Even the venerable ALIBERT was smitten with\r\nthis German transcendentalism, and he observes of the Aix waters—“these\r\nsprings, under the empire of Nature, most undoubtedly enjoy a species of\r\n_vitality_ (une sorte de vitalité) in common with other living bodies\r\non this globe. They are _animated_ by a multitude of principles, which\r\nwill long, perhaps for ever, elude the most laborious researches of\r\nchemistry. The waters of Aix-la-Chapelle, whether used internally or in\r\nbaths, act as potent restorers of vital energies. Their constituents are\r\npowerfully aided in efficacy by the high temperature and the impregnation\r\nof divers gases. Taken internally they excite the action of the abdominal\r\nviscera—detach mucosities and other morbid secretions, and evacuate them\r\nby the bowels, kidneys, and skin. The inhalation of the vapour rising\r\nfrom these waters has been very serviceable in many cases of pulmonary\r\naffections.”\r\n\r\nThis _vitality_ hypothesis did not escape the notice of my friend Dr.\r\nGranville, who appears, however, to have thought it rather too large\r\nfor John Bull to swallow, without some qualification. He therefore\r\nsubstituted “caloricity” for “vitality,” in order that so good an idea\r\nmight not be lost—and that some _mysterious_ agency might aid the natural\r\noperation of the German spas. This mode of explaining the _ignotum_ by\r\nthe _ignotius_ is, no doubt, very ingenious; but, for my own part, I\r\nshall at once acknowledge my ignorance, not only of the manner in which\r\nmineral waters are formed in the bowels of the earth, but of their\r\n_specific_ action (if any) on the human frame.\r\n\r\nThe spa doctors candidly allow that the waters of Aix, “if taken too hot\r\nand in quantities too large, may produce irritation, and even purgation.\r\nBut the latter is not a very common effect of these waters. In small\r\ndoses they are favourable to digestion; and, taken in moderation,\r\nthey are not calculated to weaken.” As baths, these waters act on the\r\nsurface, and, by sympathy, on the internal organs, exciting the nervous,\r\nsecreting, and circulating organs. The temperature of the blood (98°) is\r\nconsidered the best for the bath. “If taken at a higher degree, or too\r\noften, they are dangerous.”\r\n\r\nLet us now advert to the bill of fare which Alibert, Monheim, Zillerland,\r\nDordonville, Reumont, and others, have spread before the invalids\r\nresorting to Aix-la-Chapelle. I shall endeavour, here and elsewhere, to\r\nform some scale or estimate of the probable, doubtful, and dangerous\r\nagency of the waters and baths.\r\n\r\n    1. PROBABLE.—2. DOUBTFUL.—3. DANGEROUS.\r\n\r\n    Difficult digestion, without organic disease (1)—Acidities\r\n    in the stomach and bowels (1)—Cramps in the stomach\r\n    (1)—Coliques (1)—Worms (1)—Constipation (2)—Mesenteric\r\n    obstruction (1)—Obstruction of liver (1)—Of Spleen (1)—Of\r\n    Kidneys (2)—Hypochondriasis (2)—Hysteria (1)—Hæmorrhoids\r\n    (1)—Want of sleep (2)—Jaundice (1)—Dropsy (2)—Derangement\r\n    of monthly health (1)—Sterility (2)—Diarrhœa (2)—Chronic\r\n    dysentery (2)—Chronic catarrh (2)—Renal and vesical calculi\r\n    (2)—Glandular enlargements (1)—Scrofula (1)—Tubercles of the\r\n    liver (2)—Rheumatism, fixed or wandering (1)—Gout, if perfectly\r\n    chronic (1)—Cutaneous eruptions, chronic and not inflammatory\r\n    (1)—Morbid effects of mercury (1)—Effects of mineral poisons,\r\n    as of lead (1)—Deafness (2)—Loss of voice (2)—Weak vision\r\n    (2).—These waters are contra-indicated in hæmorrhages—tendency\r\n    to apoplexy—(though they are said to be sometimes useful in the\r\n    paralysis following apoplexy.)\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a tolerably copious list of maladies which may be\r\nbenefitted by the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle—and from their sensible\r\nqualities and long-established reputation, there is little doubt but that\r\n_fashion_ has drawn away from them to other more favoured places, many\r\nwho would have derived great advantage from their use. The remarks on\r\ndrinking, bathing, and preparatory measures, will be found under the head\r\nof EMS, to prevent repetition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORCETTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half from the “Fontaine Elisée,” in a romantic little\r\ndell, over which the rail-road will soon pass, lies Borcette. The waters\r\nresemble those of Aix-la-Chapelle, but they are (one of the sources)\r\nentirely devoid of the sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The temperature is\r\nabout 150° Fahr. The water is clear, and has an acidulous taste. There is\r\none source where the waters are sulphurous. Latterly a chalybeate spring\r\nhas been discovered here. Borcette is more quiet, and the air fresher\r\nthan in the town, and the baths are a good deal frequented. The new town,\r\nfrom the Fontaine Elisée to Borcette, is very handsome, and the theatre\r\nis a most beautiful building.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIX-LA-CHAPELLE\r\n\r\nPresents more Lions than the “Vitalised Waters” of Alibert. Within its\r\ncathedral are preserved some of the most venerable relics that ever pious\r\nCatholic bowed to in adoration—relics—\r\n\r\n    “Which Jews might kiss and Infidels adore”—\r\n\r\ntrophies over time, which might make St. Januarius blush, and give the\r\nhead of the church a fit of the jaundice! A tithe of these cannot be\r\nnoticed. 1. The robe of the Virgin Mary which she wore at the nativity.\r\nIt is made of cotton, and is five feet and a half in length.—2. A nail\r\nfrom the holy cross.—3. The head of St. Anastasius.—4. One link of the\r\nchain which bound St. Peter in prison.—5. Some of the oil which flows\r\nfrom the tomb of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai, and which is possessed of\r\nmiraculous powers in curing various diseases!—6. Several fragments of the\r\nROD OF AARON.\r\n\r\nWho would believe that this rod of Aaron has never once scourged the\r\nDemon of Play and his disciples, who carry on their diabolical works in\r\nthe depth of night, under the very nose of Charlemagne, surrounded as\r\nhe is by such stupendous relics, and aided by the prohibition of the\r\nPrussian government?[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo German spa is better known to the English than EMS, lying in a narrow\r\nvalley of the Lahn river, only six miles from Coblentz, in the Duchy of\r\nNassau. The town is built on the right bank of the little river, and the\r\nslate hills rise almost perpendicularly behind it. The sun’s beams are\r\ncollected into a focus there, during a great part of the day, and the air\r\nis hot and sultry. These hills, on both sides, are covered with vines,\r\ntrees, or cultivation. The walks about Ems are not so well shaded as at\r\nWisbaden and some other watering-places in Nassau; but there are plenty\r\nof donkeys and guides to take the invalids up to the higher grounds for\r\npure air. The environs are very pretty, especially the road to Nassau,\r\nabout five miles from Ems.[49]\r\n\r\nThese waters did not escape the notice of the Romans, whose coins and\r\nother vestiges have been found there. The waters issue from the foot of\r\nthe eastern slate mountain (Mont de Bains) and their sources are hidden\r\nfrom human eye and investigations.[50] They are clear and transparent as\r\ncrystal, when first drawn in a clean glass. The chief fountains are the\r\nKESSELBRUNNEN and the KRACHENCHEN—the _first_ has a temperature of 115°\r\nof Fahrenheit—the _latter_, only 83°. These are the drinking springs.\r\nThere are several others, varying in temperature from 80° to 124°, and\r\nused as baths. Some of them are about the temperature of the blood,\r\nand fit for general bathing, without increase or reduction. They have\r\nthe taste of chicken-broth, with a slight smack of iron. They preserve\r\ntheir physical qualities (excepting temperature) for forty-eight hours,\r\nuncorked—when corked and sealed, they are said to keep good for several\r\nmonths. They are light and easy of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe Ems waters are eminently alkaline. A pint (of the Kesselbrunnen)\r\ncontains 20 grains of bicarbonate of soda—two of carbonate of the\r\nsame—two of carbonate of magnesia—one of sulphate of soda—one of common\r\nsalt (muriate of soda)—and a very minute trace of iron. All the springs\r\ncontain nearly the same ingredients—but the Krachenchen shews much\r\nmore carbonic acid gas than the Kesselbrunnen, on account of its lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThilenius (the elder and younger) the Nestors of Ems, make the following\r\nobservations on the waters.\r\n\r\n“They operate on the human constitution mildly but efficiently, with\r\nlittle disturbance to the functions of the body. On this account\r\nthey agree well with delicate persons, whose nerves are morbidly\r\nsensitive,—the sad effects of mental emotions, civilized life, and\r\nother debilitating causes. They are, therefore, peculiarly suited to\r\nthe female constitution.—They may be employed, too, in advanced stages\r\nof disease, where other mineral waters of more exciting qualities,\r\nwould be inadmissible. Their alkaline properties enable them to resolve\r\nobstructions, and free the functions of the kidneys, skin, liver, and\r\nvarious other secreting organs—especially the uterine vessels. They\r\ncorrect tenacious and morbid bile, as well as acidities—and thus prove\r\naperient in a mild degree. Their intimate connexion with carbonic and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas enables them to give activity to the secreting\r\nvessels, and evacuate unhealthy humours, while they give vigour to the\r\nwhole organism, oppressed by chronic diseases. They have, at the same\r\ntime, a soothing and tranquillizing effect on the nervous system. No\r\nwaters, with the exception of Schlangenbad, produce such a pleasing and\r\nsalutary operation on the skin, which they cleanse, soften, and leave\r\nin a sattiny state, thus improving the complexion, and clearing the\r\npores. They are potent in discussing glandular swellings, and promoting\r\nabsorption of abnormal deposits.”\r\n\r\nThe foregoing exposition of the general effects of the Ems waters is more\r\nrational, modest, and just, than we shall usually find in the eloges of\r\nmost other spa doctors. We shall now give a catalogue of the particular\r\nmaladies for which these waters are specially recommended—marking, as\r\nusual, the probable, the doubtful, and the dangerous, with the numbers 1,\r\n2, and 3.\r\n\r\n    [1. PROBABLE. 2. DOUBTFUL. 3. DANGEROUS.]\r\n\r\n    They are represented as prompt and efficacious in all\r\n    complaints dependent on ACIDITIES (1)—Glairy accumulations\r\n    in the bowels (1)—Foul humours in the blood (1)—Spasms\r\n    of the stomach (2)—Colics and vomitings (2)—Indigestion\r\n    (1)—Irregularity of bowels (1)—Flatulence (2)—Loss of\r\n    appetite (1)—Sense of distention and malaise after food\r\n    (1)—Embarrassments of the chest (2)—Neglected catarrhs\r\n    (1)—Inveterate coughs (1)—Asthma (2)—Hæmorrhage from the lungs\r\n    (2)—Hooping-cough (1)—Loss of voice (1)—Obstinate jaundice\r\n    (1)—Gall-stones (1)—Gravel (1)—Hypochondriasis (1)—Rheumatism\r\n    and gout (1)—Spleen (2)—Hysteria (2)—Chorea (2)—Epilepsy\r\n    (2)—Chlorosis or green sickness (1)—Uterine obstructions and\r\n    irregularities (1)—Painful periods (1)—Leucorrhœa (1)—Swellings\r\n    of the limbs (1)—Induration and enlargement of glands\r\n    (1)—Sterility (2)—Paralysis (1)—Nervous and intermittent\r\n    fevers of long standing (2)—Lameness (1)—Commotions of the\r\n    brain or spinal marrow (2)—(the baths in such cases might be\r\n    dangerous)—Neglected syphilitic affections (1)—Morbid effects\r\n    of mercury injudiciously administered (1)—Ascites otherwise\r\n    incurable (2)—Diseases of the skin (1)—Fistulæ (2)—Goitre\r\n    (1)—Dropsy (2)—Inveterate inflammation of the Eyes (2)—Rickets\r\n    of children (2)—Curvature of spine (2)—Scald-head (1).\r\n\r\nFrom this ample _carte des maladies_ (and I have omitted several which\r\nwill not bear publication in this country) the valetudinarian will be\r\nable to select the dish that suits his taste—or rather the evil which\r\nhe wishes to discharge. I have endeavoured to estimate the value of\r\nthe remedy. Thilenius, indeed, expresses an apprehension that readers\r\nmay be sceptical as to the power of one remedy curing so many and such\r\ndifferent diseases. But he says—“let the sceptic come and see.” Who\r\ncan combat the following argument?—“The result of our most profound\r\nresearches is the firm persuasion that mineral waters are the gifts of\r\nDivine mercy to suffering humanity.” The same might be said of every\r\nmedicine; but medicines often do harm, and so do mineral waters, unless\r\nadministered with prudence. It will be seen that the stigma of No. 3\r\n(dangerous) has been affixed in no instance to the Ems waters; but this\r\napplies to drinking them and not to bathing. I cannot too often repeat my\r\nconviction that there is far more mischief produced by spa-bathing than\r\nby spa-bibbing—especially in the case of the Ems waters, which are by no\r\nmeans of such an exciting nature as those of Wisbaden and several other\r\nwarm springs. In every case where there is either local inflammation or\r\nconstitutional excitement, these and other thermal waters are dangerous\r\nas baths. Thilenius himself remarks as follows:\r\n\r\n“The condition of the body, when these waters are used, may be compared\r\nto that in which a kind of fever exists. It includes a period of four\r\nor six weeks, or even longer, in inveterate maladies. In this period,\r\nthe waters exert their influence for the removal of the disease. This\r\ninfluence is felt, sooner or later. It is more or less distinctly\r\nperceptible, according to the nature of the complaint. It manifests\r\nitself, generally, by a kind of languor, in which the patient expresses\r\nhimself as being ‘affected by the waters.’”\r\n\r\nThe waters of Ems have had greater reputation in affections of the\r\nchest than most other mineral springs, in consequence of the strong\r\nrecommendation of Hufeland, who observes:—“We know how few mineral\r\nsprings there are that can be used with safety in diseases of the lungs.\r\nPatients with such affections are commonly prohibited from visiting a\r\nmineral spring. Here the reverse is the case; and, in my opinion, Ems\r\nstands alone, with Selters, in this respect.”\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident, however, that it is in the more incipient cases of\r\npulmonary diseases only, that Ems could be of any service—namely, where\r\nthe tubercles are few in number, and in an unexcited condition—where the\r\ncough is slight, and the expectoration merely mucous, without fever or\r\nemaciation. In affections of the trachea, however, dependent on chronic\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane, the waters and locality of Ems have\r\nbeen found highly beneficial, as the crowds of people from all parts of\r\nGermany can testify. It really would be well worth trying Ems, in such\r\ncases, before undertaking a long journey to Pisa or Rome.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written, and while staying at Ems, in July, 1840, I\r\nmet with a recent work by Dr. Doring, bath physician at Ems, from which I\r\nthink it proper to make some extracts.\r\n\r\n“Among all the maladies which are alleviated or cured by the waters of\r\nEms, the affections of the chest are of the first consideration.\r\n\r\n1. _Pulmonary Complaints having their origin in other parts of the\r\nbody._—Where these result from congestion or engorgement of the viscera\r\nof the abdomen, connected with gout.\r\n\r\n2. _Loss of voice, hoarseness, &c._\r\n\r\n3. _Chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane of the larynx, trachea,\r\nand bronchia._—When this affection has attained the name and nature of\r\npituitary phthisis, the waters of Ems work wonders, especially where\r\nthis state depends on latent gout, rheumatism, or repelled cutaneous\r\ncomplaints. The KESSELBRUNNEN is very efficacious in such conditions of\r\nthe mucous membrane. If the malady has not advanced beyond the limits of\r\ncurability, the warm baths prove auxiliary to the internal use of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n4. _Chronic inflammation of the substance of the lungs themselves._\r\n\r\n5. _Debility of the chest._—However vague and inexact this term, there\r\nis a _disposition_ to pulmonary disease to which it may be applied, and\r\nwhich it is of great importance to recognize. One of the chief symptoms\r\nis a susceptibility to colds, or irritability of the mucous membrane\r\nof the chest, accompanied by oppression, weight, and hacking cough. If\r\nthis be neglected, it may lead to serious disease. A protracted course\r\nof the Kesselbrunnen, repeated for several seasons, has been found very\r\nefficacious in such states of the respiratory apparatus.\r\n\r\n6. _Tubercles of the lungs; or pulmonary consumption._—This dreadful\r\nmalady, which cuts off such prodigious numbers of the human race, is more\r\nfrequently arrested in its progress by the KESSELBRUNNEN, than by any\r\nother remedy. At the same time it is proper to remark that neither this\r\nnor any other remedy will prove efficacious, if the disease be confirmed.\r\nIt is where the tubercles are in a nascent or latent state, that the\r\nEms waters tend to purify the blood, and prevent further deposition\r\nof tuberculous matter in the air-cells. Perhaps, too, they may cause\r\nabsorption of those already deposited. It need hardly be urged that the\r\nearlier the waters are used the better.\r\n\r\n7. In obstinate and neglected _catarrhs of the mucous membrane of the\r\ntrachea and larynx_, the Kesselbrunnen has produced the most beneficial\r\neffects.\r\n\r\n8. _Spitting of blood._—If this proceeds from irritability of the lungs\r\nthemselves—from active congestion—or general plethora, the Ems waters\r\nwill be absolutely injurious. But if the hæmorrhage be symptomatic of\r\ndisordered conditions of the liver and other abdominal organs, then, the\r\nEms waters taken internally, but not as baths, may prove serviceable. The\r\nsame reasoning will apply to asthma.\r\n\r\n9. _Scrofula._—Daily experience has proved the efficacy of the alkaline\r\nwaters of Ems in scrofulous affections generally.\r\n\r\n10. _Nervous disorders._—The waters of this spa have a singularly\r\nsoothing and tranquillizing effect on the nervous system, as great\r\nnumbers of patients can annually testify. Hence they are much used\r\nin hypochondriasis, neuralgia, tic douloureux, periodical head-aches,\r\nchorea, &c.\r\n\r\n11. _Congestions_ of the liver and abdominal organs\r\ngenerally—hæmorrhoids—jaundice—engorgements and indurations\r\nof the uterus, ovaries, &c.—colics, cramps, and epigastric\r\npains—heart-burns—vomitings, &c. These are all ameliorated or cured by\r\nthe waters of Ems.\r\n\r\n12. _Gout._—The action of the Ems waters on the constitution is to throw\r\nout the morbid matter from the blood—the cause of this painful malady in\r\nall the normal and irregular forms. At the same time, if the malady be of\r\nlong standing, and the individual of weakly constitution, the waters of\r\nWisbaden or Carlsbad will be more efficacious than those of Ems.\r\n\r\n13. _Rheumatism._—The same observations will apply to this as to gout.\r\n\r\n14. _Chronic eruptions and ulcerations of the skin_ are greatly\r\nbenefitted by this spa.\r\n\r\n15. _Disorders of the urinary organs._—In no class of disorders have the\r\nEms waters gained more reputation than in this, including catarrh of the\r\nbladder, gravel, stone, diabetes, &c.\r\n\r\n16. _Catamenial irregularities._—Females from all parts of Europe resort\r\nto the waters of Ems for the cure of these troublesome complaints,\r\nincluding sterility, chlorosis, &c.”[51]\r\n\r\nI have introduced this quotation from one of the most recent writers on\r\nthe waters of Ems, and himself a practitioner there, of considerable\r\nrepute; but do not, and cannot vouch for the strict accuracy of all the\r\nobservations contained in it. As in most of the writings of spa doctors,\r\nit must be taken “cum grano salis.”\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTERINDICATIONS.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Doring, these are as follow:—\r\n\r\n1. The Ems waters are hurtful in all acute or subacute inflammations of\r\nany organ or structure whatever.\r\n\r\n2. In people of florid complexions or plethoric constitutions, especially\r\nif there be any disposition to hæmorrhages, or determination to the head.\r\n\r\n3. In dropsical effusions of chest, abdomen, or cellular membrane.\r\n\r\n4. In organic diseases of heart or great vessels.\r\n\r\n5. In confirmed consumption, and in marasmus from whatever cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINT OF SATURATION, OR CRISIS.\r\n\r\nThe Crises produced by the waters of Ems are not so distinct and\r\nfrequent as those resulting from some of the more potent spas. They\r\nact more gently and more slowly than the generality of mineral waters.\r\nNevertheless, the following observations of Dr. Doring are to be\r\ncarefully attended to.\r\n\r\n“There are certain cases, constitutions, and forms of disease, in\r\nwhich it would be unsafe to continue the Ems waters up to the point\r\nof saturation. Thus if, after two or three weeks’ course, there occur\r\nlittle indispositions or discomforts—feelings of debility—a sense of\r\nprostration—a change of usual temper—an increase of sensibility; or\r\neven an irritability or moroseness—an unusual propensity to sleep, with\r\nagitating dreams—a loss of appetite—or, on the contrary, a thirsty\r\nwhite tongue, bitter taste in the mouth, oppression and distention of\r\nstomach, derangement of bowels and kidneys, and acceleration of pulse—it\r\nis then time to lessen the quantity of the waters, or entirely to stop\r\nthem for some days. The foregoing are indications of over-drinking, or\r\nover-bathing, to which the term _ueberbaden_ is given, and should never\r\nbe neglected.”\r\n\r\nAs at Wisbaden, there is occasionally an eruption on the skin, after a\r\nfew baths, and this is considered to be critical.\r\n\r\nThilenius, contrary to the custom of most of the spa doctors, admits\r\nthat, although the waters alone cure many disorders, yet, in a great\r\nmany cases, appropriate medicines are absolutely necessary. He contends,\r\nhowever, and I believe with justice, that many diseases give way to the\r\ncombination of the waters and medicine, which resist the latter, if\r\nunaided by the former.\r\n\r\nThe preparation for the waters of Ems, as of all other mineral springs,\r\nis of the greatest importance, and is but too little attended to. Many\r\npatients repair to these sources, either exhausted by long-continued\r\nillness and the fatigues of the journey, or in a state of excitability\r\nfrom tonics and other medicines. In the one case some restorative\r\nremedies are to be exhibited, and in the other, quietude and saline\r\naperients are necessary before the waters are used, internally or\r\nexternally. Temperance is indispensible both before and during the use of\r\nthe waters.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR TAKING THE WATERS AND BATHS.\r\n\r\nThe best season is between the beginning of May and the end of September.\r\nThe waters are taken early in the morning. Weakly persons should begin\r\nwith small portions, till they are accustomed to the springs. The morning\r\nis also considered the best time for bathing. The patient should immerse\r\nhimself slowly—first to the knees—and afterwards the whole body, having\r\nfirst sponged the face and neck. Those who are subject to determinations\r\nof blood to the head should keep a handkerchief moistened with cold\r\nwater to the head during the bath. A bladder of cold water is still\r\nbetter. The individual should not lie quiet in the bath, and much less\r\nshould he go to sleep. He should keep constantly rubbing or sponging\r\nthe body or limbs—and if not able to do this, a servant should do it\r\nfor him. He should not remain more than ten minutes in the water, at\r\nfirst—and he should gradually increase the time to half an hour or more.\r\nThose whose skins are very sensitive ought to bathe in a flannel dress.\r\nThe temperature should be from 94° to 98° of Fahrenheit. On leaving the\r\nbath, the individual ought to wrap himself up in a warm sheet, and when\r\ndry to dress himself. It is recommended then to retire to his bed-room\r\nand remain lying on the bed for a quarter or half an hour, but without\r\nsleeping. Those who are aged, weakly, or nervous, may take a glass of\r\nmilk or a cup of coffee, after the bath. Most people can take a glass\r\nof milk and Ems waters mixed. The latest time for bathing is two hours\r\nbefore dinner. One bath in the day is quite sufficient.[52]\r\n\r\nThe waters are drunk, sometimes before, sometimes after bathing. They\r\nshould be sipped warm at the source, otherwise some of their volatile\r\nqualities are lost. The quantity taken, like that of food, must be\r\nregulated by the power of digestion. Too much water, like too much food,\r\nwill produce the same distention and discomfort of stomach. The same\r\ntemperance and frugality is necessary in both cases. From two to three\r\nwine-glassfuls of the waters taken twice, thrice, or four times, at\r\nintervals of a quarter of an hour, will in general be sufficient. Some\r\ncow’s or goat’s milk may be mixed with the waters. Gentle exercise,\r\nbetween the doses of water, is essentially necessary. In some cases it\r\nmay be proper to take a few glasses of the waters two or three hours\r\nafter dinner—not sooner.\r\n\r\nAsthmatic people, and those labouring under serious maladies of vital\r\norgans, are recommended to take a few glasses of the waters in their\r\nbeds, early in the morning—but never to exceed a pint in this way.\r\n\r\nA light breakfast may be allowed in half an hour or an hour after the\r\nlast tumbler of water at the springs. It is fortunate that near this, as\r\nnear most alterative waters, there is a chalybeate—viz. Schwalbach—where\r\nthe patient may be very conveniently sent, when no farther progress\r\nis likely to be made at Ems; or where a tonic is necessary after the\r\ndebilitating effects of the latter have taken place. Those who cannot\r\nvisit Ems may take the bottled waters at a distance, with very little\r\nloss of virtue. They will keep for several months. They are used with\r\nconsiderable benefit _en lavement_. Of the _douches_ or local application\r\nof the waters to the ailing region, I need not speak.\r\n\r\nThe regimen, while taking these and other waters, is of some\r\nconsequence. Coffee or chocolate half an hour after the last glass, with\r\nbread but no butter, is the rule of the day at Ems. Tea is prohibited,\r\nas too much favouring perspiration—a rather unnecessary precaution I\r\nimagine. A liquid preparation of rice (called _content_) with some spice,\r\nis recommended to those of very nervous temperaments for breakfast.\r\nBetween breakfast and dinner, some light avocation, conversation, or\r\nreading—after which a promenade. Temperance is essentially necessary at\r\nthese waters, as they generally excite the appetite. The dinner hour\r\nof one o’clock at the TABLE-D’HÔTES is a great bore to all who are not\r\ndownright ill—and these had better dine at home. The siesta is condemned\r\nin strong terms by Thilenius, if there be any fulness about the head,\r\nor if the individual be plethoric; but to the weakly this indulgence is\r\nallowed. The early dinner draws after it, as a necessary consequence,\r\nsome supper—so that, upon the whole, the four o’clock dinner, without\r\nsupper, will be found the most convenient and salutary.\r\n\r\nOf the gambling-tables I shall take another opportunity to speak: mean\r\ntime the following remark of Thilenius will not be inappropriate here.\r\n\r\n“He who cannot gamble _without losing his temper_, should avoid the\r\nhazard-tables.” This is easy morality! The physical effects of passion\r\nand all the horrible emotions of mind at roulette, are merely considered\r\nas hurtful to the body of the bather; but no idea appears to be\r\nentertained that these are detrimental to the soul as well as to the\r\nbody. The fact is, however, that none but gamblers by profession, and not\r\nall of them, can win or lose money without passion, although they may\r\ncontrive not to shew it strongly in their countenances. In every point\r\nof view, therefore, moral and physical, these hells on earth ought to be\r\nshunned as eagerly as those of the nether regions.\r\n\r\nI may now make a few cautionary remarks on the dangers of bathing and\r\ndrinking the waters of Ems, and indeed of mineral waters (thermal) in\r\ngeneral—a subject little touched upon by writers at the spas themselves.\r\nI cannot too often or too strongly warn every one against warm baths,\r\nwho has the slightest degree of local chronic inflammation going on in\r\nany of the organs of the body, as evinced by white tongue, dryness of\r\nskin, accelerated pulse, evening thirst, or scanty action of the kidneys.\r\nThe exciting mineral waters, taken internally or externally, will be\r\nalmost certain to raise the chronic into a subacute, or even acute,\r\ninflammation, with a corresponding grade of constitutional irritation. Of\r\nthis I have seen many instances, both at home and abroad. The existence\r\nof such conditions should be carefully ascertained before the spa is\r\nintroduced: and proper means taken to remove all traces of inflammation.\r\nBut even where there is no proof of any inflammatory action, the state\r\nof plethora or general fulness of the vessels renders warm bathing\r\nhazardous. In all, or almost all organic diseases of internal parts,\r\nespecially of the heart, brain, or lungs, the warm bath is to be\r\neschewed. The tide of the circulation carried to the surface by the hot\r\nbath, must have a subsequent recoil, and then the weakened organ may\r\nsuffer. Besides, the warm and, still more, the hot bath excites the heart\r\nand great vessels into increased activity for the time, and the blood\r\nis carried with greater force towards the brain, endangering congestion\r\nthere. But what are the admonitory symptoms or phenomena by which the\r\npatient may judge, when danger is approaching? The spa doctor is not\r\nalways at hand, in these emergencies. He is often too much employed\r\nat such times. When giddiness, sleepiness, chilliness, confusion of\r\nthought, weariness, head-ache, pains in the limbs, unusual sounds in the\r\nears, sparks before the eyes, loss of appetite, oppression after food,\r\nfeverishness, thirst, languor, depression of spirits, inability to sleep\r\nat the usual hour, malaise or, in fact, any uncomfortable feeling, not\r\npreviously felt, occurs soon after drinking the waters, and especially\r\nafter bathing, and if these, or any of these recur after the second or\r\nthird day, let the waters be suspended till advice is taken. I am well\r\naware that the spa-doctors will say—“oh these are critical, or even\r\nfavourable symptoms, demonstrating the efficiency of the spring.” All I\r\nsay is—_Beware!_ you are standing on a precipice!\r\n\r\nWe must now take leave of Ems. It is a very hot place in warm weather,\r\nand I must say that the exterior and interior of the houses are not in\r\nthe most perfect accordance. The fogs are frequent in the mornings,\r\nand the heat oppressive in the middle of the day. Few people can\r\nsleep without some of the windows being kept open, and the danger of\r\ncatching colds is not inconsiderable. The reputation of the waters is\r\nvery extended. The Empress of Russia and her daughter were swallowing\r\nthem freely while we were there (1840), and seemed to require them or\r\nsome other restoratives, as they exhibited any thing but hyperborean\r\ncomplexions. Several physicians have recommended a residence at this spa\r\nduring the Winter; and I am inclined to think that it would not be a bad\r\nsejour for people with tracheal affections, or irritable conditions of\r\nthe mucous membrane of the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKFORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis celebrated city has changed its nature, but not its name—the\r\n_latter_ being now more appropriate than ever. It is a FREE-FORT,\r\nthat is, it is free from fort or citadel—rampart or fosse—glacis\r\nor sallyport—cannon or mortar—shot or shells! All these have been\r\nconverted into much better things—gardens, shrubberies, and promenades.\r\nFrankfort, I apprehend, has more of nominal freedom than real liberty.\r\nThe protection of the German potentates is stronger, no doubt, than her\r\nancient walls; but she is as much under the surveillance and control of\r\nthese “HIGH MIGHTINESSES,” as ever she was under that of her military\r\ncommandants, when a first rate fortress. Be that as it may, Frankfort is\r\nnow a great emporium or re-union of commerce and carriages—of Jews and of\r\nGentiles—of bankers and of brokers—of lenders and of venders—of consuls\r\nand of caléches—of voitures and of retours—of envoyés and employés—in\r\nfine, it is a large “normal school” for studying the first lines of\r\ndiplomacy, trickery, traffic, and stock-jobbery.\r\n\r\nThe old and the new portions of the city present a curious contrast—youth\r\nand beauty united to age and ugliness!\r\n\r\nOne of the great lions of Frankfort is the cemetery, a few miles out of\r\ntown. It is a huge “painted sepulchre,” marble without, and mummy within.\r\nThis “city of the dead,” is not much smaller than its neighbour of the\r\nliving. True, the mansions are on a smaller scale, and the chambers are\r\nlow, dark, and unventilated; yet their inhabitants—\r\n\r\n    “Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,”\r\n\r\nshew no symptoms of discontent, feuds, or family quarrels. They sleep\r\nwithout dreams, unagitated by the habitual passions which invade the\r\nbosoms of those whom they have left in the busy city on the banks of\r\nthe Main. If the rage for cemetrical building goes on at the present\r\nrate of impulse, a time must come, when the cities of the dead will\r\nequal, both in number and extent, those of the living—and necessity\r\nwill then compel the _latter_ to have recourse to the ancient mode of\r\nsepulture—incineration. A small urn, instead of a costly tomb, will then\r\nhold the ashes of our friends and ourselves, without any encroachment on\r\nthe soil that supplies us with food, fuel, and raiment. And, after all,\r\nthis seems a less revolting process of preserving some frail memorial of\r\nthose we loved and honoured, than that of committing them to the earth,\r\nthere to “lie in cold obstruction, and to rot,” the prey of worms, and\r\nall crawling things!\r\n\r\nI believe there are few people, of reflective minds, who can wander round\r\nthe splendid cemetery or lonely churchyard, perusing the brief memoirs of\r\nthe silent inhabitants below, without feeling some of those sentiments\r\nand emotions, which Hervey cloathed in language. These records of the\r\ndead, short as they are, will be found, each, to contain at least two\r\nfacts or truths—the birth and death of the individual. I wish as much\r\ncould be always said for the lengthy biographies of the living! These\r\nauthentic documents—these “bills of mortality”—teach us one important\r\ntruth, viz.—that LIFE is a loan, and not a gift, granted to a piece\r\nof clay, without interest indeed, but with the power of resumption at\r\nthe pleasure of the lender, with or without notice. DEATH, again, is\r\nnothing more than the payment of a debt—the surrender of a policy. Has\r\nman any just cause to murmur at the shortness or uncertainty of life,\r\nbecause the vital spark animates, without solicitation, his atom of\r\nearth—sparkles for a few moments—is extinguished by the same invisible\r\nhand—and is reduced again to dust? If this be all, if the brief existence\r\nof man be “rounded by a sleep,” he has little cause to be proud of the\r\nintelligence which distinguishes him from the inferior animals. HE alone,\r\nof all created beings, knows that he must die—a bitter thought at all\r\ntimes—and cruelly bestowed, if death be annihilation! As we see no proofs\r\nof injustice in the other works of the Creator, it is fair to presume\r\nthat there is none here, and that the fore-knowledge of death in this\r\nworld is indicative of life in another.\r\n\r\nIf an inhabitant of another planet were to visit our cemeteries,\r\ngraveyards and churches, perusing the necrological literature of those\r\nlocalities, he would soon come to the conclusion that this our little\r\nGlobe was a perfect Paradise, inhabited by the most amiable of all God’s\r\nfinite creatures. Every stone would present him authentic proofs that\r\nthe whole community consisted of affectionate fathers, loving husbands,\r\nvirtuous wives, indulgent parents, dutiful children, and sincere friends!\r\nWhat would be his astonishment when, on mixing in the busy haunts\r\nof men, he found them everywhere engaged in public wars or private\r\nquarrels—in litigations, persecutions, robberies, and assassinations—torn\r\nwith all the vile passions of envy, hatred, malice, jealousy, and\r\nmalevolence—distorting the good actions of their neighbours, and\r\nexaggerating their failings—violating the laws of Nature, and evading the\r\nlaws of man—in fine, exhibiting a picture the very reverse of that which\r\nhe found delineated on the tablets of the departed!\r\n\r\nIn this perplexity, he would fly back to his native planet, and report\r\nthat the inhabitants of TERRA were a race of beings inexplicable in their\r\ncharacter—the dead all ANGELS—the living all DEVILS! And yet nothing\r\nwould be more erroneous than such a report. The haunts of the living and\r\nthe habitats of the dead—the city and the cemetery—the cheerful village\r\nand the country church-yard, being found to contain the same relative\r\nproportion of good and evil spirits. The reason of the discrepancy above\r\nalluded to, has been appreciated in all ages—“de mortuis nil nisi bonum.”\r\nThe shroud is our last and kindest mantle. Its texture is so close as to\r\nconceal all our vices—but at the same time so transparent as to reveal\r\nall our virtues. It is not then on tombstones that we are to seek for\r\ntruth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKISSENGEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is comparatively a young cub amongst the great spa-lions of the\r\nContinent; but it is one that is likely to attain an immense size. Dr.\r\nBalling, resident physician at this spa, and, still later, Dr. Welsch,\r\nson-in-law of Dr. Maas, have published on these waters.\r\n\r\nKissengen is situated almost in the heart of Germany, in the kingdom\r\nof Bavaria, and can be reached in two or three days from Frankfort.\r\nThe waters issue from the earth in a valley stretching from north to\r\nsouth—the surrounding heights, covered with woods, and not averaging\r\nmore than 600 feet in altitude. The valley itself is fertile in corn,\r\nwine, and fruits. The little river SAALE runs through the centre of it.\r\nKissengen is nearly equidistant from Wurtsburg, Bamberg, Meiningen, and\r\nFulda. Its latitude is 49° 50´, north—and it is not more than 600 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.[53] The temperature, from April till October,\r\nis moderately warm. In consequence of the great evaporation of saline\r\nwater at the salt springs, the atmosphere is a good deal impregnated with\r\nsaline principles, and is similar to sea-air. It is considered beneficial\r\nin all scrofulous affections.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many mineral springs here, but it will only be\r\nnecessary to notice the Maxbrunnen—Ragotzy—Pandur—Soolensprudel—and\r\nTheresienbrunnen.\r\n\r\n1. _Maxbrunnen._—This rises near the Cursaal and Conversation-house, with\r\na bubbling or boiling noise—clear as crystal, and exhaling its gaseous\r\npearls with great rapidity. The carbonic acid gas adheres to the sides\r\nof a glass and gives the water a milky appearance. All the springs of\r\nKissengen abound in this gas. The temperature is 52° Summer and Winter.\r\nThe taste is acidulous and refreshing. According to Kastner (1833) a pint\r\nof this spring contains nearly 30½ grains of solid matters, and 31 inches\r\nof carbonic acid gas. The principal ingredients are 18½ grains of muriate\r\nof soda—1 grain ditto of potash—3 grains muriate of magnesia—2½ grains of\r\ncarbonate of lime—1½ grains of sulphate of soda—1 grain sulphate of lime.\r\nThis spring contains no trace of iron.\r\n\r\n2. _Ragoczy, or Ragotzy._—At the southern extremity of the colonnade is\r\nseen this spring, together with that of the PANDUR. The Ragoczy rises\r\nwith considerable noise, discharging air-bubbles freely. The water is not\r\nso clear as that of the Maxbrunnen—having a blueish cast. The temperature\r\nis nearly the same as the other. The taste is salt and bitter, with\r\na degree of astringency. But the taste varies very much from day to\r\nday—at one time the salt, at another the bitter, predominates, with,\r\noccasionally, a ferruginous savour. It requires four large pumps to\r\nexhaust the spring.\r\n\r\nThe pint contains 85 grains of solid matters, and 26 cubic inches of\r\ncarbonic acid gas. Of these 85 grains, 62 are common salt—6 muriate of\r\nmagnesia—3 carbonate of lime—2 carb. magnesia—2 sulphate of soda—2\r\nsulphate of lime—2 silex. The other six grains are immaterial, except the\r\nsubcarbonate of iron, of which there are three-quarters of a grain in\r\neach pint.\r\n\r\n3. _The Pandur._—Only 34 feet distant from the Ragoczy, the Pandur\r\nsprings to light, with great noise and bubbling. Its taste is more salt,\r\nbitter, pure, and piquant than that of the Ragoczy—“and is much more\r\nrelished by the ladies.” It is so plentiful that it can furnish from\r\neight hundred to a thousand baths daily. The pint contains 76 grains of\r\nsolids—of which, 57 are muriate of soda—5 muriate of magnesia—5 carbonate\r\nof lime—2 carb. of magnesia—about half a grain of subcarbonate of iron—1¾\r\ngrs. of sulphate of soda—28 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n4. _Soolensprudel._—About a mile from the foregoing springs, and in\r\nthe middle of the valley, near the bank of the river, this remarkable\r\nspring was discovered by boring 311 feet through the earth. It does not\r\nflow in an even uninterrupted stream, but rises and falls at irregular\r\nperiods—often with a noise resembling cannon. It generally ebbs and\r\nflows eight or nine times in the twenty-four hours. When the water is\r\nat its greatest height, it boils, and roars, and foams at a great rate.\r\nThis spring rises through a salt-water mine, if the expression can be\r\nused. Its solid contents are enormous, namely 172 grains in the pint! Of\r\nthese, common salt alone amounts to 107½ grains—muriate of magnesia 24½\r\ngrains—muriate of lime 4 grains—sulphate of soda 25 grains—carbonate of\r\nmagnesia 6½ grains—carbonate of lime 1½ grains—subcarbonate of iron not\r\nquite half a grain—carbonic acid gas 30½ cubic inches. From this it will\r\nbe seen that, in solid ingredients, the Soolensprudel outstrips all the\r\nother springs. In temperature too, it differs from the others, being 66°,\r\nor as nearly as possible that of the sea.\r\n\r\n5. _Theresienbrunnen._—This springs from a depth of 140 feet, and\r\ndischarges itself with a bubbling noise like the others. The water is\r\nclear as crystal, and whitens the sides of the glass with the carbonic\r\nacid gas. The temperature is 52 or 3°. The taste is tart, saltish,\r\nagreeably pleasant and refreshing. The quantity furnished is abundant.\r\nThere are 29½ grains of saline matters in the pint, with 28½ cubic inches\r\nof carbonic acid gas. Of these, 18½ grains are muriate of soda—2¾ muriate\r\nof magnesia—2½ carb. magnesia—2 carb. lime—1½ sulphate of soda, with some\r\nslight quantities of minor ingredients.\r\n\r\nBetween this spring and the Maxbrunnen there is a considerable affinity;\r\nbut the Theresienbrunnen has the advantage, in possessing a greater\r\nproportion of carbonic acid gas, by which the saline matters are held in\r\nmore complete solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL EFFECTS AND PROPERTIES OF THE KISSENGEN WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe various springs, in their physical and chemical properties, have\r\none common and characteristic physiognomy. They rise from mountains\r\nof the same formation, and with more or less identity of force. They\r\nall contain abundance of muriate of soda and carbonic acid gas.\r\n“Mineral waters, however, cannot be estimated merely by their physical\r\nand chemical qualities. Each spring is an organic whole (_ensemble\r\norganique_), and possesses its peculiar mode of existence—‘et a sa\r\npropre maniere d’etre.’”[54] “In general, the springs of Kissengen,\r\nwhen taken internally, excite the nutritive functions of the body—alter\r\nthem—promote the various secretions and excretions—and thus resolve,\r\npurify, and re-organise the animal machine.”[55] In addition to these\r\neffects (which an ordinary mortal might be content with), the springs\r\nof Ragoczy and Pandur possess a strengthening and tonic quality, in\r\nconsequence of the iron which they contain. The Soolensprudel, whether\r\ntaken alone, or mixed with the Ragoczy, acts briskly as an aperient.\r\n“In this combination of tonic with alterative properties, the Kissengen\r\nwaters (Ragoczy and Pandur), have no equals in the spas of Germany.” “In\r\nall the other spas it is the solvent principle (principe resolutif) which\r\npredominates—in these, the various principles are united harmoniously.”\r\nThe efficacy of these waters is greatly increased by a series of baths of\r\nthe same. The order of these baths is ranged as follows:—the Maxbrunnen\r\nis gently exciting, and at the same time tranquillizing—the Pandur is\r\nsolvent and promotes the secretions—the Ragoczy, alterative and tonic—the\r\nSoolensprudel profoundly penetrating and strongly solvent. The sensible\r\neffects of these baths are of a refreshing, animating nature—altering and\r\nbringing the functions of the skin into a normal or healthy condition,\r\nand establishing the harmony between the cutaneous surface, and the\r\nvarious organs and membranes of the interior—thereby dispersing disorders\r\nof those parts. To these effects Dr. Balling adds those which result from\r\nthe absorption of the finer and more soluble ingredients of the waters,\r\nwhich pervade all the organs and tissues through the medium of the\r\ncirculation. The doctor asks, where are to be found such baths as these,\r\ncontaining such various minerals, and so easy of combination, as to meet\r\nevery variety of malady?\r\n\r\n“These mineral waters (internally and externally) applied to the\r\nsurface—taken into the circulation—or digested in the stomach or\r\nduodenum, oppose themselves, in the living organism, to morbific\r\nmatters—afterwards exciting and assisting nature to expel these morbid\r\nprinciples from the body. _In this case an irritation, a re-action\r\nis established throughout the whole constitution, converting chronic\r\ndiseases into those of a greater or less degree of acuteness, accompanied\r\nby febrile symptoms._ This fever assumes a septenary type, lasting,\r\nsometimes one week, sometimes two. In this stage _it requires the\r\ngreatest care on the part of the patient, and the greatest vigilance and\r\nskill on the part of the physician, to manage this febrile period, so as\r\nnot to let it run too high, nor yet to fall short of the salutary range_.\r\nIt is only in this stage, that the diseased organism perceives its\r\nmalady—and it is absolutely necessary that the patient should feel ill,\r\nif he hopes to recover his health.”[56]\r\n\r\nDr. Balling is perfectly right when he says that this febrile re-action\r\nrequires the greatest skill and care. But is it not evident that among\r\nthe shoals of patients who take the waters of Kissengen, or any other\r\nwaters of the kind, several must experience danger, and some even fatal\r\neffects, from this re-action? We may be sure that the late Duke of Nassau\r\nhad the best advice at Kissengen, and yet he lost his life by the warm\r\nbath there!\r\n\r\nThe waters of Kissengen are recommended by our author with dietetic and\r\nprophylactic intentions, to prevent diseases and correct a disposition to\r\nthem, as well as to remove them when fully developed.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Maxbrunnen are excellent means for preserving the\r\nconstitution from dispositions, or, as they are termed, predispositions\r\nto diseases, arising from original taint, or following attacks of acute\r\ninflammatory complaints.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Maxbrunnen internally, and of the Pandur in baths,\r\nhave been used for many years _dietetically_ as preventive of scrofula,\r\nin those whose parents had been strumous, or who themselves shewed\r\na tendency to it—and also of affections of the mucous membrane of\r\nthe chest, and also of the abdomen. They are used habitually against\r\ndisposition to venous congestion of the abdominal viscera, the prolific\r\nsource of gout, hypochondriasis, hæmorrhoids, cutaneous eruptions. Among\r\nthe chief symptoms of the abdominal plethora, Dr. B. adduces acidity,\r\ndisagreeable taste in the mouth, uneasy digestion, tension and fulness\r\nof the hypochondria, sense of oppression at the chest, turbid urine,\r\nirregular bowels, constipation, dry skin, or malodorous perspirations,\r\neruptions on the surface, &c. For these symptoms the Ragoczy and Pandur\r\nare reckoned heroic remedies.\r\n\r\nAmong the maladies actually developed, or developing themselves, Dr.\r\nB. has arranged the following, with short remarks on each, as being\r\npeculiarly under the influence of the waters of Kissengen.\r\n\r\n1. _Catarrhal affections_ of the mucous membrane of the chest, so far\r\nadvanced as to be threatening phthisis, have been cured or greatly\r\nbenefitted by the waters of this spa. They are said to be equally\r\nefficacious in affections of the mucous membrane of the kidneys, bladder,\r\nand uterine system, as well as of the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\n2. _Rheumatic complaints._—Great numbers of patients afflicted with the\r\nlarge tribe of rheumatic affections, resort annually to Kissengen for\r\nrelief, and, as is asserted, with remarkable success.\r\n\r\n3. _Scrofula_, developed, as well as brooding in the constitution—now\r\nso universally diffused among society—has, in the waters of Kissengen,\r\na powerful remedy—more especially enlargement of the mesenteric glands,\r\ntubercles of the lungs, &c. Many unmarried females present a complication\r\nof scrofulous and nervous symptoms, indicated by enlargement of the\r\nmesenteric glands, pains and tenderness of the abdomen, hysteria,\r\nirregular menstruation, and numerous symptoms of disordered digestion.\r\nThese are much benefitted, if not cured, by the Kissengen waters.\r\n\r\n4. _Hæmorrhoidal affections._—The Ragoczy and Pandur are famous in these\r\ncomplaints, so prevalent on the Continent, and regarded with so much\r\nimportance there. It will be a sufficient specimen of German pathology\r\non this point, to remark that the very enlightened physician whose work\r\nI am quoting, looks upon latent piles as indicated by the following\r\nsymptoms: viz.—head-aches—perspirations—pain in the spleen—cutaneous\r\neruptions—vertigo—diarrhœa—asthma—blennorhagia—ovarian tumors—weakness of\r\nsight—spectral images before the eyes—vomiting of blood—swellings of the\r\nliver, uterus, &c.—discharges of blood from the kidneys, bowels, &c. “In\r\nall these masked forms of hæmorrhoids, the waters of Kissengen are more\r\nor less beneficial.” p. 49.\r\n\r\n5. _Gouty affections._—Where gout wanders about, and annoys the internal\r\norgans, the waters of this spa are asserted to be of great efficacy.\r\n\r\n6. _Cutaneous eruptions._—These are looked upon as only external signs of\r\ninternal affections—especially of disorder in the abdominal viscera, for\r\nwhich the Kissengen spas are almost specific.\r\n\r\n7. _Hypochondriasis._—The vast number of hypochondriacs who annually\r\nresort to Kissengen, are, Dr. B. thinks, incontestible proofs of the good\r\neffects of the waters. Considering that hypochondriacs run every where,\r\nand seldom get cured, this proof is rather equivocal.\r\n\r\n8. _Hysteria_, in all its various forms.—9. Melancholia.—10. Asthma—when\r\ndependent on abdominal affections.\r\n\r\n11. _Stomach complaints._—12. Affections of the bowels.—13. Ovarian and\r\nuterine diseases.—14. Neuralgic affections, tic douloureux, &c.—15.\r\nDebility.—16. Various complaints following acute diseases, as fevers,\r\ninflammations, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL EFFECTS AND MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF THE DIFFERENT SPRINGS.\r\n\r\n1. _Maxbrunnen._—This water, when taken early in the morning, causes a\r\ncertain degree of irritation in the fauces and nose, that leads to slight\r\ncough or sneezing, succeeded by a sensation of heat in the stomach, and\r\nnot unfrequently by some confusion or giddiness in the head, as if from\r\nwine. These phenomena are speedily followed by a comfortable feeling,\r\nrefreshment, and agility. After a few glasses of the water are drunk,\r\nthe secretion from the kidneys is augmented considerably, followed by\r\nperspiration—and ultimately by some action on the bowels. This last\r\neffect, however, does not generally take place till after the waters have\r\nbeen used for a few days. The mucous secretion, however, both from the\r\nbowels and air-tubes is always increased—especially if there had been\r\npreviously any tracheal or bronchial affection. This spring is found\r\nto be most beneficial to people of bilious, phlegmatic, and plethoric\r\ntemperaments. People who shew a decided disposition to catarrhal\r\naffections, or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the lungs, will\r\ndo well to mix the Maxbrunnen water with an equal quantity of whey.\r\nScrofula, chronic bronchitis, indigestion, and other affections, are\r\nbenefitted by these waters.\r\n\r\n2. _Ragoczy._—A glass of this water taken fasting, causes a refreshing\r\nwarmth in the stomach, followed by some degree of distention, with\r\nslight eructations of gas. The head next becomes affected, with a\r\nsense of pressure in the front, and even some degree of giddiness. If\r\nsufficient exercise be taken between each glass, a gentle perspiration\r\noccurs—the kidneys act more freely—and phlegm is expectorated from the\r\nmucous membrane of the air-passages. All these symptoms are generally\r\nfollowed by two or three actions on the bowels. This cycle of phenomena\r\noccupies from two to four hours, when the symptoms all subside, and\r\nthe patient feels comfortable during the remainder of the day. These\r\nphenomena continue for some days—and as the appetite augments, it is too\r\noften indulged freely, with inconvenience. At the end of a few days,\r\nall the functions of the body, but especially the mucous secretions,\r\ntake on a considerable degree of activity—and the secretions themselves\r\nbecome changed in quality as well as quantity. From the end of the first\r\nweek till the end of the second, the general state of health is much\r\naltered, in consequence of the excited condition of the whole organism,\r\nwhich is now roused into action against the malady. “The patient becomes\r\nirascible, capricious, discontented;—the waters no longer render him\r\ncomfortable, brisk, or increase his appetite:—on the contrary, the tongue\r\nbegins to be furred, the appetite to fail, the secretions to become\r\nirregular and morbid, not only from the bowels, but from the other\r\nmucous membranes, and even the skin, which often exhales a peculiar\r\nacidulous odour.” The urinary secretion gets thick and sedimentary, with\r\na predominance of acid or alkali, and a scum over its surface. If the\r\nliver or spleen were affected, they now become softer, and the abdomen\r\nis sensible to pressure. The same is observed in the other abdominal and\r\npelvic organs when previously affected. In short, when the patient begins\r\nto think that the waters are disagreeing with him, and making him ill,\r\nthe Doctor is of a very different opinion, viewing this re-action as a\r\nsalutary effort of Nature, assisted by the waters, to expel the morbific\r\nmatter or cause of disease from the system.[57]\r\n\r\n3. _The Pandur._—The physical effects of this spring are nearly the same\r\nas those of the Ragoczy. It acts a little more strongly on the kidneys,\r\nskin, and bowels. On this last account it is a most useful spring in all\r\nabdominal congestions, torpid bowels, and sluggish liver. On the same\r\naccount also (its aperient qualities) it causes less of the re-action\r\ndescribed above, affects the head much less than the Ragoczy, and also\r\nthe chest. The effects of the Pandur, when taken in the evening, are\r\nworthy of notice. If two or three glasses are taken in the evening,\r\nit has a calming, tranquillizing effect on the whole system—promotes\r\nsleep—or produces it if the individual were previously wakeful. At the\r\nsame time it promotes perspiration, and secretion from the kidneys;\r\nbut does not act on the bowels—unless a large quantity be taken. About\r\neight or nine in the morning, however, it opens the bowels comfortably,\r\nespecially if assisted by a few morning glasses of the same water. In\r\nthis respect it differs greatly from the Ragoczy—which cannot be taken\r\nin the evening. It is also an important auxiliary to the Ragoczy. The\r\nPandur is preferable to the Ragoczy in all cases where an alterative,\r\nsolvent, and aperient effect is more desirable than a tonic. It is\r\nfitter for young females affected with abdominal and uterine plethora—or\r\nindeed plethora of any part, than the neighbouring spring. It is also\r\nmore profitable in nervous, irritable habits than the other. Where\r\nconstipation obtains, it is peculiarly useful.\r\n\r\n4. _Soolensprudel._—It is only about two years (before March 1839)\r\nthat this water has been used internally. It is strongly purgative\r\nand solvent. Two or three glasses taken fasting, are sure to produce\r\none, or even several evacuations from the bowels, without griping or\r\ninconvenience. Although there is a very small quantity of iron in the\r\nSoolensprudel, yet, in combination with the carbonic acid gas, it does\r\nnot weaken the digestive organs, so much as some other waters of the\r\nsaline kind. It may be given, as an aperient, in all cases where the\r\nRagoczy and Pandur are proper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATHS.\r\n\r\nThe effects of all the Kissengen waters, when used as baths, have a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to each other. The plus or minus of carbonic\r\nacid gas, and of iron, make the chief differences. As the baths have\r\nhardly ever been employed without the internal use of the waters, their\r\neffects cannot be positively ascertained as under other circumstances.\r\nThe general phenomena, however, may be stated as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe patient feels soothed, refreshed, and even strengthened, by the first\r\nfew baths; but about the seventh day, the symptoms of re-action commence,\r\nand then the pleasing sensations of the bath disappear—and he feels\r\nenfeebled and uncomfortable after leaving the water. These phenomena\r\nincrease. The skin becomes relaxed—slightly reddened, and copious\r\nperspirations break out—or if not, the kidneys act vigorously. If there\r\nbe any cutaneous eruptions, they increase, become inflamed, and discharge\r\nfreely. Rheumatic and gouty pains are exasperated, and sometimes carried\r\ninto a state of acute inflammation, with fever, which lasts three or four\r\ndays, and then disappears. In such cases, the baths must be discontinued\r\nfor a short time. In general, most of the diseases which are ultimately\r\ncured by the baths and waters, are, for a certain period, rendered\r\nworse. In the course, or rather towards the end of this re-action,\r\ncertain critical evacuations take place, more especially from the skin,\r\naccompanied by a peculiar odour—or boils or other eruptions break\r\nforth—or depositions take place in the urine, sometimes even of blood—or\r\nby the bowels. This crisis past, a state of amelioration takes place, and\r\nnow the baths should be discontinued, not at once, but gradually.\r\n\r\nThe morbid conditions which require the baths _more_ than the drinking\r\nof the waters are—chronic affections of the skin—rheumatic and gouty\r\ncomplaints, whether external or internal—neuralgic affections—complaints\r\ndriven from the surface to the interior.\r\n\r\nWe need not dwell on the slight differences which take place in the use\r\nof the baths of the Maxbrunnen, Pandur, and Ragoczy. The baths of the\r\nSoolensprudel deserve a remark or two. The baths of this source are more\r\npowerful than those of the others, often producing considerable heat\r\nand irritation of the skin, accompanied by corresponding re-action of\r\nthe system generally—even to fever, which requires marked and vigilant\r\nattention, otherwise very serious consequences may result. At the same\r\ntime, it may be observed that the baths of the Soolensprudel are less\r\ndisposed to affect the head and the chest, than other baths of weaker\r\npowers, if used with caution. They have hitherto been chiefly employed\r\nin cases of confirmed scrofula, both external and internal—in uterine and\r\novarian affections—in inveterate rheumatic and gouty complaints.\r\n\r\nIn the after-cure, the waters of Bocklet and Bruckenau, chalybeates both,\r\nare almost essential, to restore the strength, after the alterative\r\nand aperient waters of Kissengen, and after the struggle which the\r\nconstitution has had with the malady.\r\n\r\n1. _Season._—Dr. Balling conceives that different complaints require\r\ndifferent periods of the season for their removal by the waters of\r\nKissengen. In general, however, the time is from the middle of Spring\r\ntill the end of Autumn.\r\n\r\n2. _Preparation._—Dr. B. gives us some advice on this point, which we can\r\nseldom follow—namely, to dismiss all care, before we visit Kissengen!—to\r\nbring with us a statement of our case from the physician in ordinary—to\r\nbring warm clothing, adapted to Winter as well as Summer—not to bring\r\nunnecessary family and servants—to travel leisurely from home to\r\nKissengen—to rest a few days after the journey, before the waters or\r\nbaths are taken, and consult with the physician of the place.\r\n\r\n3. _Mode of taking the waters._—The time is from six till eight o’clock\r\nin the morning. The quantity of the waters taken must depend on the\r\ncapability of the stomach to digest them. As there is much carbonic\r\nacid gas in the waters, they ought to be drunk quickly, each portion.\r\nThe Ragoczy and Pandur are generally taken cold; but, in particular\r\ncases, the chill may be taken off them. Ten or twelve minutes should\r\nintervene between each goblet of the waters. The first glasses are more\r\neasily digested than the later ones. Easy walking between the glasses is\r\nbeneficial. All persons disposed to congestions about the head or chest,\r\nas evinced by giddiness, or oppression in the act of breathing, should be\r\nvery cautious and moderate in the use of these waters. In the period of\r\nre-action, the symptoms should be marked by the patient and communicated\r\nto the physician. Breakfast may be taken in half an hour after the last\r\ngoblet of water. If the waters are taken in the evening, it should be\r\nfour or five hours after dinner. These regulations apply chiefly to the\r\nRagoczy and Pandur. The Maxbrunnen spring is generally drunk with a\r\nmoderate proportion of whey or milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATHS.\r\n\r\nThe waters of the Maxbrunnen remain clear when heated. The others become\r\na little turbid by the heat. Patients are recommended not to bathe in\r\nany of these waters for three or four days after their arrival. They\r\nshould be taken for some days internally, before the baths are used, in\r\norder that the bowels may be free, and the secretions improved. They\r\nought to be employed to the point of saturation—which generally takes\r\nplace in a shorter time than by the drinking of the waters. The baths are\r\ntaken before noon, and after drinking the waters, before breakfast—or in\r\nthe evening. The baths, however, may be taken two hours after a light\r\nbreakfast—and are more agreeable to most people at this time than before\r\nthe repast. Once a day is often enough. They are generally raised to 96°\r\nor 98° of Fahrenheit—and half an hour is the usual period of immersion.\r\nIt is prudent not to stay in more than ten or fifteen minutes at first,\r\nand to gradually increase the period, till it comes to thirty or forty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n“Patients who are disposed to convulsions, vertigo, faintings, or fulness\r\nabout the head, should not use these baths but with extreme caution. Such\r\npeople ought to keep the head covered with cloths wet with cold water\r\nduring immersion.”[58] These baths are absolutely prejudicial, if the\r\npatient goes in when heated, perspiring, or excited by passions of the\r\nmind. The bather ought not to plunge at once into the bath, but first to\r\nsponge the chest and stomach with the warm water. It is hurtful to read\r\nin the bath, and more so, to go to sleep. On the contrary, the bather\r\nshould keep in constant motion, to use friction with his own hands over\r\nthe chest and abdomen. “If, during immersion, the patient be seized\r\nwith feverish heat, chilliness, shivering, head-ache, oppression on the\r\nchest—or any kind of malaise, he should immediately quit the bath, and\r\nexamine whether or not the temperature has been too high or too low. He\r\nshould dress himself quickly on leaving the bath, and take some turns in\r\nthe dressing-room before going into the open air. Gentle exercise after\r\nthe bath is very beneficial.”\r\n\r\nThe point of saturation from the baths is considered by Dr. Balling as a\r\nmatter of great importance. This point is not attained till the morbific\r\nmatters are expelled from the constitution, and all the secretions\r\nhave become healthy and natural—especially those from the intestinal\r\ncanal. The time necessary for attaining this desirable condition will\r\nbe different in different constitutions—and in different diseases.\r\nGenerally speaking, it requires two weeks of the bath. After this period\r\nthe patient and physician should be on their guard, and watch well the\r\nphenomena as they occur.\r\n\r\nThe effects of these waters on the human organism do not cease when the\r\ndrinking and bathing are left off. They often continue for a long time,\r\nand complete the cure which was left incomplete at the spa. It but too\r\nfrequently happens that, when patients experience no relief at medicinal\r\nspas, they are told to hope for a cure from the _consecutive_ effects\r\nof the waters. They are often disappointed. In respect to the Kissengen\r\nsprings, we are informed by Dr. Balling, that unless they produce the\r\n_reaction_ already described, during the time the patient is using\r\nthem, no _consecutive_ effects are to be expected. But, on the other\r\nhand, if the reaction clearly shews itself at the springs, considerable\r\nconsecutive effects, of a salutary nature, may be confidently looked\r\nfor—and the remainder of the cure may be safely trusted to nature at\r\nthe patient’s own home. The system of diet enjoined by the Kissengen\r\nphysicians, and Dr. Balling in particular, is nearly as rigid as at most\r\nof the other spas, where certain doctors have hobbies which they ride to\r\ndeath beyond the Rhine as well as in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock in the morning the band marches and plays through the\r\nmiddle of the town to the garden, summoning the sick to their morning\r\npotations. “It is here,” says Dr. B. “that a most curious scene presents\r\nitself to the musing eye. Eight hundred or a thousand invalids (for\r\ncomparatively few others go to Kissengen) are quickly assembled in the\r\nwalks of the “JARDIN DE CURE,” of all conditions and ages—the prince\r\nby the side of the tradesman—the queen by that of the peasant girl—all\r\nhaving but one object in view, the recovery of health. Nothing can be\r\nmore interesting than the general physiognomy which characterises the\r\nwhole moving mass of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe great spas present a morbid physiognomy each peculiar to\r\nitself. Carlsbad exhibits the yellow and earthy—Ems the pallid and\r\nhectic—Pyrmont, the pale chlorosis—the “green and yellow melancholy” of\r\nthe love-sick maiden. Kissengen has its peculiar physiognomy—but it is\r\na deceitful one—a countenance of morbid fulness and floridness, little\r\nindicative of the grave maladies which lie concealed.”\r\n\r\nThis garden is of considerable extent, and contains numerous walks. Those\r\nwho like to be in the crowd may find their wishes satisfied in the middle\r\nalleys—those who are fond of solitude, may indulge their meditations\r\nin the remote paths. Those who are fond of comparing notes with their\r\nbrother and sister sufferers, have ample means of doing so, in this\r\nasylum of valetudinarians.\r\n\r\nAt eight o’clock all disperse to their breakfasts; after which they\r\neither repose for an hour or two, or take some walking exercise. At\r\neleven o’clock, the bathing process commences, after which another\r\npromenade or repose—and then the one o’clock dinner. After dinner,\r\nand perhaps a cup of coffee, the promenades in the garden, and the\r\nexcursions into the country are made. In the evening, the garden, the\r\nconversation-halls, theatre, and gambling-tables, are the great places of\r\nresort.[59]\r\n\r\nI shall conclude with the following remark of Dr. Balling.\r\n\r\n“In speaking of the gaming-tables of the Kurhaus, which are open from\r\nthree till ten o’clock every afternoon, it is to assert, in the most\r\npositive manner, that all such games are eminently injurious to invalids,\r\nand greatly obstruct the cure of their complaints. This is the case\r\nwhether the individual wins or loses money. In the state of excitement,\r\nalmost febrile, produced by the waters themselves and the re-action of\r\nthe constitution, the valetudinarian runs the risk of some dangerous\r\nperturbation in the animal organism, which may cost him his life, and, at\r\nall events, must interrupt the salutary operation of the springs.”\r\n\r\nP.S.—On visiting these waters in August, 1840, I found that the number\r\nof English invalids had somewhat decreased during that season. The\r\nreputation of the waters, however, is evidently on the increase. I saw\r\nseveral English who had experienced considerable benefit in stomach\r\ncomplaints; whilst others complained much of the bad effects of the\r\nwaters on the head and nervous system. They are powerful waters, and\r\nrequire attention. The spa doctors of Kissengen now enjoin a most\r\nrigid system of diet, which greatly aids the medicinal effects of the\r\nwaters. No wine is allowed. The food is confined to soup and a little\r\nmeat, without any pudding, fruit, vegetables, or made dishes of any\r\ndescription! This dietary, with early hours and plenty of water, must\r\ngo a good way to insure restoration of health, independently of the\r\nmedicinal ingredients in the springs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOCKLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the waters of Carlsbad or Kissengen have washed away the\r\nsuperfluous green fat and ill-assimilated roast-beef from the body of\r\nJOHN BULL—the sour krout and rancid sausages from the GERMAN—and the\r\ncaviare and train oil from the RUSS—then these worthy personages repair\r\nto BOCKLET or BRUCKENAU, to undergo a very different process from that\r\nof depuration—namely, to have their ribs lined with steel, and their\r\nstomachs converted into gizzards. According to my information, those\r\nwho come to these acidulous chalybeate springs with digestive organs in\r\na state analogous to that of blotting-paper, go away from them, with\r\nthe same organs in a condition very closely resembling well tanned\r\nsole-leather!\r\n\r\nThe visitors of Carlsbad and Kissengen, are all radical reformers,\r\ntearing up by the roots the numerous vices and abuses that have crept\r\ninto their constitutions;—but at Bocklet and Bruckenau, they become\r\neminently conservative—carefully rebuilding the various dilapidated\r\nportions of the body corporate in the firmest manner, and on the most\r\ndurable foundations.\r\n\r\nBocklet is only half-a-dozen miles from Kissengen, and the waters contain\r\nlittle more than two-thirds of a grain of iron to the pint; but then\r\nthere are 31 cubic inches of free carbonic acid gas, which confer on\r\nthe iron the greatest possible state of solution, and consequently the\r\ngreatest degree of energetic action on the human frame. In the pint of\r\nthis water, also, there are 27 grains of muriate of soda—six grains of\r\nsulphate of soda—seven grains of carbonate of lime—nearly two grains\r\nof carbonate of magnesia, with some slight saline impregnations, of no\r\ngreat importance. The whole of the solid contents are between 40 and 50\r\ngrains in the pint. These ingredients, however, gently modify the action\r\nof the iron, and render the water much safer, in many complaints and\r\nconstitutions, than the purer chalybeates (as for instance Bruckenau)\r\nwhere the astringency and stimulation of the steel are unmitigated by\r\nsaline counter-poises. Dr. Hans, the Apollo of Bocklet, is loud in\r\nthe praises of these waters, taken internally and used as baths—and\r\nindeed, from their composition and their physiological action, I think\r\nit probable that they are of greater utility, and applicable to a wider\r\nrange of diseases than any other chalybeate in Germany, or perhaps in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nAt no spa do the applicants live more completely _en famille_ than\r\nhere—all dining, drinking, and promenading together, sans ceremonie.\r\n\r\nThe cuisine at Bocklet appears to be under the superintendence of the\r\ndoctor. We dined at the one o’clock table-d’hôte, and had nothing but\r\nsoup—some bouilli—and roast chicken, instead of the endless courses\r\nat other table-d’hôtes. The whole, with a pint bottle of wine, cost\r\nabout eighteen-pence for each person! Bocklet, however, seems but\r\nlittle frequented, compared with Bruckenau, though its waters are of an\r\nexcellent quality. The drive from Kissengen along the side of the Saal,\r\nis very pleasant, and passes the Soolensprudel and salt works, which we\r\nstopped to examine. The Soolensprudel was in high feather, foaming and\r\nboiling over into conduits that conveyed it to the baths. It is well\r\nworth seeing.\r\n\r\nThere are some pleasant excursions in the neighbourhood, where time may\r\nbe killed, and health promoted by the same process.\r\n\r\nThe air for a mile or two around the salines strongly resembles sea\r\nair, where there is much sea-weed on the shore. It is very grateful and\r\nrefreshing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUCKENAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the distance of sixteen miles from Kissengen, a route requiring\r\nfive hours and a half, with strong horses, over a road which is by no\r\nmeans abundant in good scenery, but exuberant of steep hills and rough\r\ncauseways, lies BRUCKENAU, between two lofty and wooded hills, in the\r\npretty but certainly not romantic valley of the SINN—a chalybeate much\r\nfrequented, even by royalty—the King of Bavaria having a residence\r\nthere for taking the waters in the spa-season. There are three or four\r\nsprings—two, the Sinnberger and Wernarzer, close together, on the left\r\nbank of the river—resembling tolerable, and only tolerable, soda-water,\r\nin taste, having scarcely any savour of steel—and containing not more\r\nthan a grain of solid matters in the pint. The former of these is much\r\nused in calculous complaints—scrofula—and chronic affections of the\r\nmucous membrane of the lungs. Dr. Schipper affirms that the water of the\r\nSinnberger possesses a peculiar, or rather specific influence on the\r\nskin, in the promotion of perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe Wernarzer is nearly the same in taste and composition; but is more\r\nused in dyspeptic complaints, or morbid sensibility of the gastric and\r\nintestinal nerves.\r\n\r\nIt is on crossing the little river Sinn, that we come to the lion of\r\nthe place—the BRUCKENAUER, springing up under a large red pavilion, and\r\ndischarging its contents through four tiny wooden tubes, into a circular\r\nbasin, encrusted with the red oxide of iron. I saw none of the commotion\r\nwhich Dr. Granville describes; on the contrary, the Bruckenauer is one\r\nof the most quiet and placid wells which I have ever seen, considering\r\nthat the water contains 36 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas to the pint,\r\nwhich ought to make it as frisky as Champagne. It is pleasant to the\r\ntaste; but not more so than the Weinbrunnen at Schwalbach—the Pouhon at\r\nSpa—or the Pandur at Kissengen. In fact, I was greatly disappointed, as\r\nfar as taste is concerned, in the waters of Bruckenau, so exaggerated\r\nare the accounts which have been published respecting their ethereal,\r\nsparkling, exhilarating, piquant qualities.\r\n\r\nThe chalybeate nature of the Bruckenauer is unequivocally evinced by\r\nthe great deposition of iron on all parts of the basin in which it is\r\ncontained—and by the strong iron gout which it leaves in the mouth\r\nafter being swallowed. Although there is only a quarter of a grain of\r\nsteel in the pint, yet this mineral is at its maximum of oxidation,\r\nin consequence of the great proportion of carbonic acid gas, and the\r\nBRUCKENAUER is therefore held to be the clearest and most pure chalybeate\r\nin the world. The physiological effects of this spa are considered to be\r\nhighly stimulating, tonic, and astringent—augmenting the velocity of the\r\ncirculation, and the volume of the pulse—oxygenating the blood—giving\r\ntone to the body, and colour to the lips and cheeks of the blanched\r\nfemale. In addition to these valuable qualities, the Bruckenau waters\r\nare said to possess the opposite ones—of tranquillizing (“arresting\r\nevery symptom of irregular mobility,”) of the nervous system. Now, if\r\nall the spa-doctors, between Carlsbad in the East, and Saratoga in the\r\nWest, combined to certify this fact, I would remain sceptical. I will\r\nnot maintain that such conflicting qualities are incompatible with each\r\nother; but it would require very weighty facts to induce me to believe\r\nthat they co-exist in this pure chalybeate spring.\r\n\r\nBruckenau is to Germany what Tonbridge Wells is to England. Although the\r\n_latter_ spa contains much more iron than the Continental one, Bruckenau\r\nhas greatly the advantage in the large proportion of carbonic acid gas,\r\nrendering the German chalybeate infinitely more tonic than the English.\r\n\r\nThe water of Bruckenau, then, like all pure tonics, is a powerful engine\r\nin skilful hands; but a dangerous weapon when wielded without judgment.\r\nDebility, or at least a feeling of debility, attends almost every\r\ndisease, whether acute or chronic. To remove this symptom is the constant\r\nprayer of the patient, and the great embarrassment of the practitioner,\r\nwho knows that those remedies which augment the general strength, too\r\noften increase the activity and danger of the local disorder. It must\r\nbe owned that in medicine, as well as in other professions, there are\r\nindividuals who, for the sake of ill-got fame and sordid pelf, will\r\npander to the appetites, prejudices, and ignorance of the public, and,\r\nthrough the agency of food and physic, force, as it were, the general\r\nstrength beyond the level at which the local malady can be safely\r\nremedied. The fire is smouldered but not extinguished, and is sure to\r\nbreak out, sooner or later, with redoubled violence. But the object of\r\nthe doctor is attained—the fees are secure, and his skill is already\r\nattested by the deluded victim, who is ashamed afterwards to recall the\r\ntestimony. The attempt to restore general health or strength by tonics\r\nor chalybeates, where there exists a local disorder of any organ or\r\nstructure, is not merely illusory, but prejudicial or even dangerous.\r\nHence the necessity of an accurate examination of all the organs, before\r\na course of tonics is entered on at home, or a journey to a chalybeate\r\nspa abroad. Much expense, fatigue, and disappointment would be saved\r\nby such a preliminary investigation. It is in cases where the general\r\nhealth and strength are breaking down under _functional disorder_, and\r\nwhere this disorder is corrected by other spas or proper medicines, that\r\nthe chalybeates of Spa, Schwalbach, Bruckenau, or Bocklet, act like a\r\ncharm in restoring energy to the constitution, taken internally and used\r\nexternally.\r\n\r\nThe chalybeate bath requires caution and attention, as well as the\r\ndrinking of the waters. Although much of the iron is lost by the escape\r\nof the carbonic acid gas, still the corrugation, redness, and roughness\r\nof the skin produced by immersion in the chalybeate bath indicate a\r\npowerful agency, and when lassitude, drowsiness, head-ache, or sense\r\nof exhaustion follow the bath, the patient should be on his guard, and\r\neither desist, or report to the bath physician.\r\n\r\nThere must be an especial freedom from all organic disease, and even\r\nfrom functional disorder—especially disordered function of the liver or\r\ndigestive apparatus, attended with morbid secretions, where such a pure\r\nand powerful chalybeate as Bruckenau can be safely employed.\r\n\r\nThe King of Bavaria has erected here a Cursaal apparently intended to\r\nrival, or rather to eclipse its celebrated namesake of Wisbaden. It is\r\na structure of great height, dimensions, and decorations, surrounded\r\non all sides by a fine open colonnade, and presenting a noble portico.\r\nAt the table-d’hôte, of one o’clock, there sate down about eighty or a\r\nhundred guests; but many of them were, no doubt, visitors from Kissengen.\r\nThey seemed to defy the rigid injunctions of the Kissengen doctors, and\r\nprobably considered that during the “NACH-KUR” or after-cure, and while\r\nthey were lining their ribs with steel, they ought to have a commensurate\r\nlatitude in the enjoyments of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANZENSBAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the distance of three short miles from the town of Eger or Egra,\r\nin Bohemia, lies Franzensbad, a spa of considerable reputation. The\r\nsituation is not very pleasant, being rather bare of wood and shade, and\r\nthe surrounding country by no means picturesque. The town, or village,\r\nin fact, is in the midst of a great bog, and the houses, like those\r\nof Amsterdam and Venice, are built on piles driven into the ground.\r\nFranzensbad is a colony from Egra, and dates only from 1795. It took its\r\nname from the principal source—FRANZENSQUELLE. The houses are modern,\r\nclean, and cheerful—the walks, though not yet sufficiently numerous or\r\nshaded, are in progress—and the bazaars furnish all kinds of necessaries,\r\nand even luxuries, to the spa-goers.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. FRANZENSQUELLE, OR BRUNN.\r\n\r\nThis is the lion of the place, and is the first spring on which we\r\nstumble on our way from Eger. Its name was formerly the Egra, and its\r\nwaters, which are now exported to every corner of the earth, still go\r\nby the name of Eger water. It is supposed to have been known for eight\r\nhundred years past. The spring is placed under a circular temple, from\r\nwhich the bazaar colonnade stretches round two sides of a square. It\r\nsends forth 275 cubic inches of water per minute, at an invariable\r\ntemperature of about 49°. The water of this well is clear as crystal,\r\nand discharges great numbers of bubbles of gas, which coat the sides of\r\nthe glass. It is a long time before it becomes turbid in the vessel.\r\nIn the course of several days it begins to be decomposed, and lets fall\r\nsome particles of oxide of iron. This spring is in continual agitation,\r\nemitting with some noise its carbonic acid gas. It has no odour of any\r\nkind, and the taste is very pleasant, piquant, and refreshing. The\r\naprès-gout, or after taste is decidedly chalybeate. Mixed with a fourth\r\npart of white wine and some sugar, the Franzensquelle forms a remarkably\r\nagreeable beverage. If the sugar be in fine powder, and briskly stirred\r\nabout in the glass, the whole foams up like Champagne.\r\n\r\n_Physiological properties._—The Franzensquelle is considered by all the\r\nbest medical authorities on the subject, as at one and the same time,\r\nsolvent, strengthening, and stimulant. Its chief contents are as follows:\r\nin a pint or pound of the water, there are 34 grains of solid matters,\r\nand 30½ cubic inches of carbonic acid gas. The chief ingredients are ¾\r\ngrain of silex—6⅓ grs. bicarbonate of soda—one third of a grain of oxide\r\nof iron—1¼ grain of carbonate of lime—19 grains sulphate of soda—7 grains\r\nof muriate of soda—in all 34 grains.[60]\r\n\r\nAlthough it contains one-third of a grain of steel, and that minutely\r\ndissolved by means of the carbonic acid, yet the Franzensquelle may be\r\nadministered to people who are both irritable and debilitated, without\r\nany danger of proving too heating or exciting.\r\n\r\nIts internal use produces the following effects. 1. It acts on the\r\nnervous system, which it strengthens, tranquillizes, and diminishes\r\nirritability. 2. On the muscular system it exerts a tonic effect. 3.\r\nOn the vascular system it produces an increase of activity—accelerates\r\nthe circulation—augments the red colour of the blood, as well as the\r\nanimal heat of the body. It also increases the functions of digestion,\r\nassimilation, and nutrition. 4. It dissolves mucus in the bowels, expels\r\nworms, and rarely produces constipation. On the venous circulation of\r\nthe liver it is believed to act in a very salutary manner—dissipating\r\ncongestions in that quarter. 5. On the uterine system it acts vigorously,\r\nproving both tonic and stimulant. Hence it is much used by females of\r\npale complexions, watery blood, and various derangements peculiar to\r\nthe sex. 6. The water of this spring is diuretic, and beneficial to\r\nthe kidneys, when their function is disturbed. 7. It is asserted that\r\nthe Franzensquelle is useful in relaxed states of the mucous membrane\r\nof the trachea and bronchia. The union of a solvent and tonic property\r\nis attributed not so much to the combination of saline and chalybeate\r\ningredients, as to their antagonism, thus producing a new agent of\r\nspecific powers. And here I consider it better to take the opinion of\r\nthe venerable Hufeland, on these waters, than the assertions of the\r\nspa-doctors themselves. The following sentiments were published by the\r\ncelebrated Prussian physician in 1822.\r\n\r\n“When I speak of the waters of Franzensbad, it is as of an old and valued\r\nfriend. The renown of these waters has continued ever since the days of\r\nHoffman, and I myself have witnessed many remarkable cures effected by\r\nthem. In 1820, I drew a parallel between the waters of Franzensbad and\r\nthose of the Kreutzbrunn, at Marienbad—all from personal observation. It\r\nwas long the custom in Berlin and other large towns, for the merchants,\r\nmen of letters, politicians, and, in fact, the greater part of the\r\nbureaucracy, to tear themselves from their various occupations, and\r\ntake the waters of Franzensbad for a month. They almost all laboured\r\nunder a complication of functional disorders, as difficult and painful\r\ndigestion, constipation, deranged secretions, or gouty affections. While\r\ntaking the waters, they were separated from their offices—kept early\r\nhours—lived temperately—and enjoyed exercise in the open air. The effects\r\nwere remarkable. They laid in a stock of health for the remainder of the\r\nyear—and thus prevented functional disorders from advancing into changes\r\nof structure. Frederick the Great was one of those who profited by the\r\nwaters of Franzensbad. This illustrious monarch often became a prey to\r\nthe most miserable feelings and gloomy sentiments. In 1748, this state\r\namounted to a high degree, aggravated by a tertian fever and various\r\ngouty affections. At this period the king considered that his days were\r\nnumbered, and that his last ones were at hand. His physician prevailed\r\non him to try the waters of Egra (Franzensbad), where he completely\r\nrecovered his health, and lived to an advanced old age.”\r\n\r\n“Although the waters of Franzensbad belong to the chalybeate class,\r\ntheir properties are quite peculiar. They are very ethereal, and combine\r\nso much saline matters with the iron, that they are penetrating, easy\r\nof digestion, tonic, exciting, animating without heating, solvent of\r\nobstructions, aperient, and favourable to the promotion of healthy\r\nsecretions and excretions. These waters are incomparable when the\r\nobject is to purge without debilitating—to increase the activity of the\r\nblood-vessels without heating or producing congestion—to strengthen\r\nwithout constipating. It follows from this, that there are few chronic\r\nmaladies for which these waters are not an effectual remedy—and few\r\npersons who will not bear their operation well.\r\n\r\n“I shall now briefly allude to the principal complaints to which the\r\nwaters of Franzensbad are particularly applicable.\r\n\r\n“In the first rank stands HYPOCHONDRIASIS, especially if accompanied by\r\natony of the bowels, congestion of the abdominal vessels, constipation,\r\nhæmorrhoidal tendency, or determination of blood to any of the vital\r\norgans. In such cases _pure_ chalybeates would only augment the evil;\r\nwhereas the saline chalybeates are of the greatest benefit. Chronic\r\nnervous affections, with or without cramps or spasms of stomach and\r\nbowels, are a class that derive great advantage from these waters. The\r\nsame may be said of all chronic disorders, the sequel of long-continued\r\nindigestion, with flatulence, acidities, and eructations. Hæmorrhoids,\r\nwhether fluent or dry, are ameliorated or removed by the waters of\r\nFranzensbad. They are almost specific in biliary derangements, from\r\ntorpid liver up to actual jaundice. Finally, in reverting to the case\r\nof Frederick the Great, I can aver that, for the long catalogue of\r\nhuman afflictions, the consequences of sedentary lives, full living,\r\nanxieties of mind, and crowded cities, the waters of Franzensbad are\r\ninimitable—even if only taken for a month each season. I have frequently\r\nordered them, and with great advantage, in affections of the mucous\r\nmembranes of the chest—and even where there were strong indications of\r\ntubercles in the lungs. In these last cases, however, it will be prudent\r\nto exhibit them in combination with warm milk—especially asses milk. In\r\nchronic affections of the kidneys and bladder—in gravel and calculus, I\r\nhave given the waters with benefit. These waters are not injured by time\r\nor carriage.”\r\n\r\nSuch are the sentiments of the celebrated Hufeland, and I have preferred\r\nthem to the statements of the spa doctors themselves, for very obvious\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE SALZQUELLE.\r\n\r\nThis spring is situated in a turfy meadow a few hundred yards to the\r\neastward of the Franzensbrunn, at the end of a long colonnade. It is\r\ndefended from the rain by a circular dome. It throws up 133 cubic inches\r\nof water per minute. It is perfectly clear, and disengages much carbonic\r\nacid gas. It takes a good while to become decomposed, when it throws down\r\nsome whitish flakes, but no oxide of iron. It has no odour, and the taste\r\nis brisk and refreshing, rather alkaline, but not in the least chalybeate.\r\n\r\n_Contents._-¼ grain of silex—7 grs. of bicarbonate of soda—a mere trace\r\nof iron—1½ gr. carbonate of lime—13½ grs. sulphate of soda—7 grs. of\r\nmuriate of soda—total about 30 grains, with 20 cubic inches of carbonic\r\nacid gas in the pint.\r\n\r\nFrom the above analysis it is evident that the SALZQUELLE differs\r\nnot essentially from the Franzensbrunn, except in the iron, which is\r\ninfinitely greater in quantity in the latter than in the former. The\r\nSalzquelle bears considerable analogy to the waters of Carlsbad and\r\nMarienbad. It is equally penetrating, solvent, and easy of digestion\r\nas the Franzensquelle, but less irritating, and more refreshing. Weak\r\npeople, and those who are disposed to congestions of blood, bear this\r\nspring better than its chalybeate neighbour. Hufeland, in 1823, published\r\nthe following opinion.\r\n\r\n“Franzensbad has gained much by the discovery of the saline (Salzquelle)\r\nspring. I am acquainted with all the German spas, and have no hesitation\r\nin stating that this source is quite peculiar in its nature, and hitherto\r\ninscrutable. The physiological action of this spring is equally mild and\r\npenetrating, promoting the secretions rather than the evacuations. The\r\nwaters of this source are more easily borne than those of the chalybeate.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE COLD SPRUDEL.\r\n\r\nThis is a small circular well, close to another very large and oval\r\none, both of which are at a short distance behind the bazaar colonnade.\r\nThis water is in continual motion, like its more celebrated namesake at\r\nCarlsbad; but does not leap so high, and is quite cold. It furnishes\r\n3648 cubic inches of water per minute. When poured into a glass it is\r\nclear and effervescent. The taste is agreeable, refreshing, and slightly\r\nchalybeate. It has no flavour; the quantity of carbonic acid gas which it\r\ndisengages while drinking, often causes sneezing.\r\n\r\n_Contents._—6⅓ grs. bicarb, soda—⅒ gr. of oxide of iron—1¼ gr. carb.\r\nlime—20 grs. sulphate of soda—6½ muriate of soda—total 33½ grs. in the\r\npint, with about 30 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nFrom the above analysis it appears that the Cold Sprudel holds a place,\r\nboth chemically and medicinally, intermediate between the Franzensquelle\r\nand the Salzquelle. It is more solvent and aperient than the _former_—but\r\nmore exciting and irritating than the _latter_. It is unnecessary to go\r\ninto details as to the cases in which the one source is preferable to\r\nthe other. A combination or alternation of the two will often be more\r\nbeneficial than an exclusive use of either.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. LOUISENBRUNN.\r\n\r\nClose to the Sprudel, and under the same canopy, boils up in prodigious\r\nquantities, the Louisenquelle. The basin is of a large oval form, and\r\ncontains several springs within itself. It disgorges 27,056 cubic inches\r\nof water per minute! It is in perpetual agitation, like its neighbour\r\nthe Sprudel, and serves exclusively for bathing. The carbonic acid gas\r\nboils up in large and innumerable bubbles, with considerable noise. It\r\nappears turbid in the basin, but is perfectly clear in a glass. The taste\r\nis quite as pleasant as that of the Franzensquelle, but without the\r\nafter-taste of ink produced by the latter source.\r\n\r\n_Contents._—⅑th of a grain of silex—4 grs. of bicarbonate of soda-¼ of a\r\ngr. of carbonate of iron—1¼ gr. carb. lime—16 grs. sulphate of soda—5\r\ngrs. muriate of soda—total 27 grains, with 24½ cubic inches of carbonic\r\nacid gas in the pint. It may be stated that the waters of Franzensbad are\r\nused externally as baths—cold, tepid, or warm, in all the diseases and\r\ndisorders for which the same waters are used internally.\r\n\r\nP. S.—Since the above was written I have received the following\r\ninformation from a most talented pupil of St. George’s Hospital (Mr.\r\nSPITTA), respecting a new source which had not been quite in operation\r\nwhen I visited Franzensbad.\r\n\r\n“One source yet remains to be noticed, of recent date truly, but still\r\nby no means to be overlooked—the Weisenquelle, or Source de la Prairie.\r\nIt is situated still further eastward of the Franzensquelle than the\r\nSalzquelle; and is principally remarkable for containing a small quantity\r\nof sulphur in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nDrs. Kœstler and Palliardi have each published a small paper on its\r\nvirtues.\r\n\r\nIt contains the most salt of any of the wells at Franzensbad. In sixteen\r\nounces there are 25.6554 grains of sulphate of soda—9.3254 of chloride\r\nof sodium—8.9787 of bicarbonate of soda—besides carbonates of lime,\r\nmagnesia, iron, (.1780 gr.) magnesia, stronthian and lithion, phosphate\r\nof lime, subphosphate of alumina, and silica, each in small quantities;\r\ntogether with .0588 of a peculiar salt termed by Zembsch the analyst,\r\n“quellsaures eisenoxydul,” or oxide of iron in combination with an acid\r\npeculiar to this well—making in all 46.6903 grains of saline matter.\r\n\r\nThis source gives off a great quantity of carbonic acid, and when you\r\napproach it the well-known odour of sulphuretted hydrogen is immediately\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nAccording to the same chemist, Zembsch, 16 ounces contain 30.691 grs. of\r\nfree carbonic acid, and .162 gr. of sulphuretted hydrogen. Its medicinal\r\nproperties are like the other springs, aperient and antacid, but from\r\nits containing so much salt, and so little iron, it forms a sort of\r\nintermediate spring between the Salzquelle, which has the merest trace,\r\nand the Franzensquelle, which contains about one third of a grain of that\r\nmetal in the pint.\r\n\r\nIt is not so much employed as the other springs; so that its specific\r\neffects dependent on the sulphur it contains have not as yet been very\r\ndistinctly observed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS BATHS.\r\n\r\nThese and the Mud-baths to be presently described, are becoming very\r\nfashionable in Germany. From every inch of surface in the peat bog\r\naround Franzensbad, carbonic acid gas is constantly issuing forth in\r\nsuch quantities that its extrication is audible and visible, wherever\r\nthere is water on the ground. To have a reservoir of this gas, it is\r\nonly necessary to build a house, and prevent the carbonic acid from being\r\ndispersed in the air. It is there collected, and baths and douches are\r\nconstructed for its ready application to the body generally, or to any\r\nparticular part thereof. The Gas-bath or building at Franzensbad, stands\r\nwithin thirty or forty yards of the Franzensquelle, and from the ground\r\nof this house, which is of very moderate extent, there issues 5760 cubic\r\n_feet_ of gas every twenty-four hours!! There is little doubt that the\r\nextrication of carbonic acid is equally plentiful in any and every part\r\nof the bog in which the town is situated. I should think that to go to\r\nsleep on the ground, in a calm Summer’s night, would be inevitable death.\r\nAs it is, the good people of Franzensbad, inhabitants and visitors, must\r\nbe perpetually inhaling an atmosphere well impregnated with this gas. I\r\ndo not suppose, however, that this is productive of any injurious effects.\r\n\r\nThe gas is conveyed into the bath through a cock at the bottom, and\r\nthe patient, being either dressed or undressed, sits down on a little\r\nstool, while a wooden lid or cover, with a hole that fits tolerably\r\nclose to the neck, is placed over the body, the head being in the open\r\nair. They have small tubes through which they can apply the gas to the\r\neyes, ears, or any part of the body, in a stream, the velocity of which\r\ncan be augmented or diminished at pleasure. They can also diminish the\r\nintensity of the gas by applying a piece of muslin or taffeta over the\r\npipe, or over the eyes or ears that are subjected to the stream. I did\r\nnot try the gas baths here, but at Marienbad I used them generally and\r\nlocally, accompanied by my kind friend Dr. Herzig of that place. Standing\r\nin the bath, the cock was turned without my being aware of it, and, in\r\na few seconds, I felt a sense of heat ascending quickly along my legs\r\ntowards the body. Without thinking of the gas I stooped, and put my head\r\ndown towards the aperture of the tube, by which I inhaled as much of\r\nthe carbonic acid as caused a sudden faintness. Dr. H. and the bathman\r\nquickly extricated me from my perilous situation, and I went on with\r\nthe bath, while my head was in the open air. I found that the following\r\nrepresentation of the sensible, and physiological effects of the bath, as\r\ngiven by Baron Aimé, is sufficiently correct. 1. The gas excites and even\r\nirritates the skin, producing a pricking, and soon afterwards a strong\r\nitching on the surface, accompanied by heat, and ultimately perspiration.\r\n2. The gas stimulates the nerves of all parts to which it is applied.\r\nI had a stream directed on my eyes, which caused a most profuse flow\r\nof tears, with strong sense of heat. When it was applied to my ears, a\r\nsense of heat, and a considerable noise were the effects produced.[61]\r\n3. It is asserted by physicians of the Continent that this gas is\r\nextremely useful when applied to old, ill-conditioned, and irritable\r\nulcers, as soothing and promotive of healthy discharge, and ultimately of\r\ncicatrisation. 4. Although the breathing of this gas is as mortal as that\r\nof the Grotto de Cane, yet if diluted with plenty of atmospheric air, it\r\nis thought that it might prove serviceable in some states or stages of\r\nphthisis, asthma, &c. 5. The action of this gas on the eyes and ears I\r\nhave already mentioned. Its remedial agency is much extolled in certain\r\ndisorders or diseases of those organs, attended with atony or morbid\r\nirritability of their nerves and structures. 6. These baths are chiefly\r\nemployed in cases of paralysis attended with stiffness, feebleness, or\r\nspasmodic movements. 7. In chronic, inveterate affections of a gouty or\r\nrheumatic nature—chronic sores—glandular swellings—and various cutaneous\r\ncomplaints, the gas baths are applied, and, as is affirmed, with success.\r\n8. In uterine affections, irregularities, &c. attended with torpor,\r\ndebility, and irritability.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole I am disposed to think that the gas baths are active\r\nagents, and that they may be made useful ones, when carefully applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUD BATHS.\r\n\r\nAmong the novelties—transcendentalisms, or, as some would call them,\r\nextravaganzas, of Germany, the MUD BATHS deserve the “passing tribute”\r\nof a short notice. But alas! there is “nothing new under the sun”—or\r\nunder the earth. To the mud of the Nile and the Ganges, virtues almost\r\nmiraculous—even the creative power of life—have been attributed, time\r\nimmemorial. Who does not know that the life of MARIUS was preserved by a\r\nmud-bath in the Minturnian marshes?—The instincts of animals, too, are\r\nnot to be overlooked: We all know the extreme tenacity of life possessed\r\nby eels—owing perhaps to their frequent use of mud-baths. Swine are\r\nproverbially subject to cutaneous complaints, especially measles; to\r\nprevent or cure which, Nature seems to prompt the daily employment of\r\nmud-baths, in the Summer season. A remarkable instance of the force of\r\ninstinct is afforded by the Indian buffalo. That animal immerses himself\r\ndaily, during the hot season, in mud, up to the very nose; by which\r\nmeans, we may conclude that he avoids the jungle fever, or cures himself\r\nof liver-complaints. The alligator offers another example. When he has\r\nswallowed a buffalo or a tiger, he buries himself up to the nose in mud,\r\non the oozy shores of the Ganges, no doubt for the promotion of digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to multiply the virtues of mud-baths. Those who desire\r\nocular proofs must repair to Franzensbad in Bohemia, where they will\r\nsee—not mud but bog-baths in perfection; though they are now also got up\r\nvery well in Marienbad, Carlsbad, Teplitz, and other fashionable spas.\r\n\r\nI have alluded to the plentiful supply of bog which the immediate\r\nvicinity of Franzensbad offers to the mud-bathers. This earth contains\r\nthe following materials:—viz: The fibres of plants not decomposed, and\r\nwhose organization is recognizable—matters soluble in water, such as\r\nvegetable substances rich in carbon, and of a yellow colour;—sulphate of\r\nlime—sulphate of magnesia—sulphate of iron—alum—bituminous extractive\r\nmatter—oxide of iron—fine sand.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the mere boggy material of the mud-bath contains many\r\nsubstances that may and do exercise a considerable physiological action\r\non the body; and medicinal agency on the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe peat bog is carried to the neighbourhood of the baths, and there\r\nallowed to dry to some extent. It is then sifted and separated from the\r\nwoody fibres and coarser materials, when it is mixed with the mineral\r\nwater of the Louisenquelle into the consistence of a very soft poultice.\r\nIn this state it is heated by steam to a temperature varying from 80° to\r\n100° of Fahrenheit, when it is ready for the bather, being worked up by\r\nmeans of wooden instruments and the hands into a complete black amalgam.\r\nI took the mud-bath here, at Marienbad, and Carlsbad, and do not regret\r\nthe experiments. I confess that, at first, I felt some repugnance, not\r\nfear, in plunging into the black peat poultice; but when up to the chin\r\n(temperature 97°) I felt more comfortable than I had ever done, even\r\nin the baths of Schlangenbad, Wildbad, or Pfeffers. The material is so\r\ndense, that you are some time in sinking to the bottom of the bath—and\r\nI could not help fancying myself in Mahomet’s tomb, suspended between\r\nHeaven and Earth, but possessing consciousness, which I fear the prophet\r\ndid not enjoy. There was one drawback on the mud-bath, or peat-poultice.\r\nWe cannot roll about, like a porpoise or whale, as in the water-bath,\r\nwithout considerable effort, so dense is the medium in which we lie;\r\nbut I found that I could use friction to all parts of the body, with\r\ngreat ease, in consequence of the unctuous and lubricating quality of\r\nthe bath. After twenty minutes’ immersion, I felt an excitement of the\r\nsurface, quite different from that of the common mineral warm baths—even\r\nof those of Wisbaden, Kissengen, or Schwalbach—attended, as I fancied, by\r\nelevation of spirits.\r\n\r\nWhilst I was thus philosophizing, like Diogenes in my tub, the thought\r\ncame across my mind that I would have a dive in the sable mixture. I knew\r\nthat the sun and winds had so tanned my complexion, that IT would not\r\nsuffer by immersion; and if my hair should get dyed black, the change\r\nwould certainly be for the better. I therefore disappeared like an eel\r\nin the mud; but, on emerging from the bog, I thought I should have been\r\nsuffocated before I cleared my face from the tenacious cataplasm. I had\r\nnow been nearly half an hour in the Schlammbad, and prepared to quit, as\r\nthe mixture was fast cooling down, and the heat could not be kept up, as\r\nin the water-bath. On raising myself slowly and perpendicularly, with at\r\nleast twenty pounds of mud on my surface, I caught a full length portrait\r\nof myself in the glass, and I think the view would have sickened\r\nNarcissus of self-contemplation for ever!! I was really shocked at my\r\nsudden metamorphosis into the Œthiopian, and began to doubt whether I\r\nshould ever “change my hue” again. The warm water-bath was close at hand,\r\nbut I had the presence of mind not to jump into it at once, as I should,\r\nin that case, render it a black wash-tub; but by clearing away with both\r\nhands, some sixteen or eighteen pounds of peat varnish from my body, I\r\nrolled into the clear fluid, where it required half an hour’s rubbing and\r\nscrubbing to purify myself from the “Bain de Boue.” Both on this, and on\r\nsubsequent occasions, at Marienbad, Carlsbad, and Teplitz, I experienced\r\na degree of exhilaration, strength, and elasticity from the mud-bath,\r\nwhich I had never done from any other. The iron in these baths, instead\r\nof corrugating the skin, as I expected, imparts to it a glossy or sattiny\r\nfeel and softness quite peculiar—and much more in degree than the waters\r\nof Schlangenbad.\r\n\r\nThe bog-earth is well picked, and in some places sifted, so as to remove\r\nall the fibrous and woody parts, leaving the fat unctuous substance to be\r\nmixed with the mineral water of the place. In general these baths produce\r\na pricking sensation, and sometimes an eruption on the skin, an effect\r\nwhich I did not experience.[62] They are therefore much used in old\r\nand obstinate cutaneous complaints, as well as in glandular swellings,\r\nsequences of gout, rheumatism, &c. They are very exciting to the nervous\r\nsystem, and should not be used where there are any local inflammations,\r\nor much general excitability of the constitution. They do not lose their\r\nheat so rapidly as the water-baths, and consequently they maintain the\r\nvolatile and penetrating principles longer than the latter. They are much\r\nemployed in paralysis, chronic ulcers, and cutaneous affections.\r\n\r\nHere and at other spas where mud-baths are employed, I met with several\r\nveteran warriors, whose aching wounds reminded them too often of\r\nbattlefields and bloody campaigns. They almost all agreed in attributing\r\nmore efficacy to these than to the common baths—and I think, from what I\r\nhave seen, heard, and felt, that there is much truth in these statements.\r\nThe Schlammbads have one advantage over the others, which is more prized\r\non the Continent than in England—the facilities which they afford the\r\nbathers, both male and female, of receiving morning visits from their\r\nfriends while in the mud, and that without any violation of delicacy,\r\npropriety, or decorum; for there, persons are more completely veiled than\r\nin any dress, even of the most dense and sable furs of Russia. An English\r\nlady of rank, at Teplitz, was visited by her physician and friends while\r\nimmersed to the chin in peat-bog. They read to her, and conversed with\r\nher till the signal was given for exchanging the black varnish for the\r\nlimpid and purifying wave, when they retired.\r\n\r\nThe rules for taking the Franzensbad waters and baths do not vary\r\nmaterially from those of other spas. The following concise direction is\r\nfrom the pen of Dr. Clarus.\r\n\r\n“A complete course of these waters requires at least four weeks. When it\r\nis thought desirable to take of more than one source, the change from\r\none well to another should not be abrupt, but gradual. We may commence\r\nwith one glass of the Salzquelle, and each day increase by the glass,\r\ntill, in a week, we come to six or seven glasses, taken at intervals of a\r\nquarter of an hour. After this period, the Salzquelle is to be decreased,\r\nglass by glass, and replaced by the Cold Sprudel. This change is to go\r\non during the second week. At the end of a fortnight, the Cold Sprudel\r\nis to be changed, in the same gradual manner, for the Franzensquelle,\r\nwhich is to be continued till the end of the course, unless some\r\ncircumstances arise to alter the arrangement. Those who are of very\r\nweakly constitutions, and especially if they labour under any pulmonary\r\ncomplaint, will do well to add some warm milk or whey to the mineral\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nThe baths are generally taken about two hours after breakfast. They ought\r\nnot to be taken unless the bowels are daily opened, either by the waters\r\nor by aperient medicine. The temperature of the baths should be about 98°\r\nof Fahrenheit, or that of the blood.\r\n\r\nBaron Aimé has collected from various sources a host of cases, of all\r\nkinds of maladies, cured or relieved by the waters of Franzensbad; but\r\ninto these it is unnecessary to go. Here the tyrant fashion has caused\r\na comparative desertion for the more attractive localities, if not more\r\nsanative springs, of Marienbad, Carlsbad, and Teplitz. The qualities\r\nof the mud, and the profusion of the gas, at Franzensbad, however, may\r\nprobably turn the current by and bye in its favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter from Mr. Spitta to Dr. Johnson._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,—I cannot quit the subject of Franzensbad without entering\r\ninto some detail on the celebrated Mud-baths. One hears much of mud-baths\r\nat different spas of Germany: but a _genuine_ Schlammbad is _seen_ only\r\nin Bohemia, and especially at Franzensbad.\r\n\r\nThe mud is obtained, as you are undoubtedly aware, from a large bog or\r\nmoor, situated at the back of the Louisen and Caltsprudel wells, which,\r\naccording to Dr. Kœstler, who accompanied me to examine it, is nine miles\r\nby three in extent; and he tells me also that the same schlamm extends\r\nto a _depth_ of 20 feet. Indeed the whole village may be said to be\r\nresting on this peat-earth; for you cannot dig up the soil to any depth\r\nwithout discovering it. The surface of the moor looked singularly black\r\nand barren; here and there, however, I discerned some yellow and white\r\nefflorescences. The yellow was by far the most abundant; and, wishing to\r\nknow its composition, I collected a considerable quantity and brought it\r\nto England. It is a highly acid salt, permanently reddening litmus paper,\r\nand extremely styptic and acid to the taste. I dried some carefully;\r\nand found that 100 grains which had been completely desiccated, yielded\r\n97.6 grains soluble in distilled water. The solution was dark brown,\r\nof the colour of beer, and contained an acid per-sulphate of iron. The\r\nremaining 2.4 grains consisted principally of iron in combination with\r\nsome vegetable acid, or extractive matter.\r\n\r\nI was sorry I could not collect sufficient quantity of the white\r\nefflorescence for examination. I merely remember its _taste_ to have been\r\nequally styptic and disagreeable as the yellow.\r\n\r\nThere are several minerals found in this moor. I am indebted to Dr.\r\nPalliardi (one of the resident medical men) for a good specimen of blue\r\nphosphate of iron; of the hydrated red oxyd of iron; and for one of\r\ngreat interest discovered _there_ by himself, termed _Kieselguhr_. This\r\nsubstance was first described by Professor Ehrenberg, of Berlin, to be an\r\naggregation, or to speak more accurately, the shells of a collection of\r\ndifferent species of infusoriæ. It is said to be pure silica—it is white;\r\nextremely light and friable, and forms one of the most beautiful objects\r\nfor the microscope I have seen. I have a great quantity; and shall be\r\nhappy to furnish yourself, or any friend that may desire it, with a\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether you visited Dr. Palliardi’s study; it would have\r\nbeen well worth the trouble. He is at once a mineralogist, a botanist,\r\nan ornithologist, entymologist, chemist, and physician. I was pleased at\r\nthe simplicity with which they made a mud-bath—they merely picked and\r\nsifted the mud (the sun having previously, to a certain extent, dried it)\r\nand digested it in the water of the Louisenquelle warmed by steam. The\r\nappearance of a bath when ready is anything but prepossessing; I must\r\nconfess, however, on making the trial, I was agreeably disappointed.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my qualms, Dr. Kœstler insisted on my taking one, and\r\nmaking myself acquainted with his darling Schlammbads from personal\r\nexperience; and I must say, when quietly seated in the mire, the\r\nsensations were by no means disagreeable. In other hot mineral baths\r\nI almost invariably experienced an oppression and anxiety at the\r\nchest; but here, I know not why, the breathing was quite natural, and\r\nnot at all hurried. The black mess was extremely acid, violently and\r\ninstantaneously reddening litmus paper; and it exhaled a peculiar odour\r\nwhich I can compare to nothing but to blacking. Its taste was styptic\r\nand saline—styptic evidently from some salt of iron, and more saline\r\nthan the water of any other mineral bath. This is no more than would\r\nbe expected when the quantity of salt it contains is considered. I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Kœstler that every bath requires 250lbs. of schlamm, in\r\nwhich are contained 33lbs. of salts. And this statement I should imagine\r\nto be tolerably correct, for I find that 120 grs. of this mud yield 15.5\r\ngrains of matter soluble in water. The solution is light brown, very\r\nacid, and contains the following substances: 1. A volatile acid, which\r\nwas separated by distillation at temp. 230 circ. and which had many of\r\nthe leading characters of acetic acid, and on which the peculiar odour\r\nof the bath depends.—2. Some fixed extractive matter in combination\r\nwith iron.—3. A large quantity of the persulphate of iron; and 4. some\r\nsulphate of soda.\r\n\r\nIn examining this specimen, I was mostly struck with the very large\r\nquantity of iron, and the comparative small quantity of other saline\r\nmatter. For a wonder it contained no _chloride_. There is a salt kept by\r\nthe chemists at Franzensbad, purporting to be the salt contained in the\r\nmud. Had they said—made from the mud, they would have been correct. It\r\nis perfectly neutral and efflorescent, and is nothing else but sulphate\r\nof soda, with just sufficient persulphate of iron left unremoved, to\r\ntinge its solution. The fact is—it is prepared by neutralising the acid\r\nsolution of the mud by _carb. soda_, and thus precipitating the iron, and\r\nretaining the salt of Glauber in solution—one or two crystallisations\r\nfurnish it tolerably pure. The opinion that it contained the phosphate of\r\nsoda and phosphate of iron, is unfounded.\r\n\r\nIn many respects, the mud-bath is unique in its action on the human\r\nbody. From the quantity of saline matter it holds in solution, it acts\r\nas a powerful stimulus to the skin, exciting the capillaries to renewed\r\nexertions; hence its great use in gouty and rheumatic paralysis. The\r\nchalky and fibrinous depositions which form this disease are absorbed\r\nunder its influence; and so effectual is it, that Dr. Kœstler, the\r\noracle of Franzensbad, will prophecy the recovery of a patient from this\r\ndisheartening complaint, after the far-famed hot springs of Teplitz have\r\nbeen tried in vain.\r\n\r\nIt is to this same property perhaps that its influence in chronic painful\r\naffections of single nerves is to be attributed. The point whether salt\r\nis actually absorbed from a bath is not, I believe, absolutely decided;\r\nbut certainly, if the fact be true, as is my firm belief, it is worthy of\r\nremark to those patients who look for the tonic effect of the absorption\r\nof iron into the blood, that it is in the mud-baths only that this metal\r\nis contained in a soluble state. In the baths of _Schwalbach_, so famous\r\nfor chlorosis, there is plenty of iron; but it is in the form of an\r\ninsoluble carbonate: yet it is stated to be absorbed by the skin, and to\r\nproduce its well-known effect on the coloring matter of the blood; it\r\nhas always appeared to me that, provided chlorotic patients could bear\r\nthe stimulation applied to the surface, the mud-baths of Franzensbad\r\nwould be pre-eminently serviceable. This remark applies equally to some\r\nforms of hysteria; and to those irregular muscular contractions of the\r\nlimbs termed chorea. Indeed it is to the absorption of this iron, I deem\r\nthat the exhilarating effect universally experienced after their use is\r\nto be attributed. Dr. Kœstler quoted to me two cases of diabetes, in\r\nwhich these baths were extremely useful; he could not however say were\r\nactually effectual. In conclusion, cutaneous affections of a chronic\r\ncharacter, unattended by fever, will be most effectually benefitted;\r\nand I believe that these very obstinate complaints, which baffle in\r\nso determined a manner the skill of the medical man, will derive more\r\nbenefit from the mud-baths of Franzensbad than from any other mineral\r\nbaths, with one exception—those of Kreuznach. I have entered more fully\r\nthan I had originally purposed into this subject; but I trust that its\r\nvery great interest, both in a scientific and medical point of view, will\r\nbe deemed a sufficient apology for trespassing so long on your patience.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                         Your’s very sincerely,\r\n\r\n                                                        ROBERT J. SPITTA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIENBAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the distance of sixteen or eighteen English miles from Eger, lies\r\nthe now celebrated spa of Marienbad, though a place of yesterday,\r\ncomparatively speaking. It is situated in a gorge or small valley between\r\ncheerful and pine-clad hills; and the houses being all modern, look\r\nextremely well. Numerous shady walks are constructed in every direction;\r\nand two murmuring and crystal streams run rapidly down the valley.\r\nThree of the springs are within a few hundred yards of each other—viz.\r\nThe Kreuzbrunn, the Carolinenbrunn, and the Ambrosiusbrunn. The\r\nFerdinandsbrunn, lies about a mile out of the village. There is another\r\nspring still farther in the woods, which contains only 7/10ths of a grain\r\nof solid matter in the pint of water. It is called the Marienbrunnen.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE KREUZBRUNN.\r\n\r\nThis is the lion of the place. It is the strongest of them all—its\r\npredominant qualities being _solvent_, with an ulterior stimulant and\r\ntonic property. It boils up under a beautiful building resembling a small\r\nGrecian temple, from the entrance of which a fine shaded promenade,\r\nwith a bazaar on one side, and a dell on the other, extends to the\r\nCarolinenbrunnen. In a pint of this spa there are 28½ grains of sulphate\r\nof soda—10 grains of muriate of soda—7½ ditto of carbonate of soda—3\r\ngrains of carbonate of lime—2 of carbonate of magnesia—⅒th of a grain of\r\niron—some vegetable extract, &c. making 52 grains in the whole. The cubic\r\ninch of water contains about a cubic inch of carb. acid gas.\r\n\r\n_Physiological Effects._—This water sits easy on the stomach. Five or\r\nsix glasses are generally taken in the morning, without inconvenience,\r\nand even with pleasure. When impurities, however, exist in the stomach\r\nor bowels, the Kreuzbrunnen often causes sickness or disagreeable\r\neructations, and then some opening medicine should be taken. If this\r\nwater causes a sense of distention, weight, or oppression at the\r\nstomach—or diarrhœa, or loss of appetite, it is a sign that the water is\r\ntaken in too large quantity—or taken too fast—or taken too long—or, in\r\nfine, that it is not agreeing with the individual. Very often, however,\r\nit is more owing to errors of diet than to the nature of the waters that\r\nthese phenomena occur.\r\n\r\nIn general the appetite is increased by the Kreuzbrunn, after the third\r\nor fourth day. It augments considerably the action of the kidneys, the\r\nwater becoming more pale and copious—and this effect generally continues\r\nduring the period of the cure. It acts on the bowels also—five or six\r\nglasses usually operating two or three times. The exported water is\r\nmore aperient than that taken at the source. The evacuations are often\r\nof a green, black, or brown colour—or glairy, and gelatinous. Sometimes\r\ndark coagulated blood is passed. When the motions become watery, the\r\nKreuzbrunn is not answering the purpose. The discharges above-mentioned\r\nafford indescribable relief to the sufferer.\r\n\r\nThings do not always, however, proceed so quietly. Occasionally\r\nthe abdomen becomes distended—the pulse accelerated—the bowels get\r\nconfined—and the fears of the hypochondriac are then greatly augmented.\r\nAccording to Dr. Heidler, Dr. Herzig, and others, these symptoms are\r\n_critical_, and soon disappear, when Nature has accomplished her object\r\nby a discharge of vitiated excretions. It is quite a mistaken notion that\r\nthe dark or green colour of the motions is owing to the minute proportion\r\nof steel contained in the water.\r\n\r\nThe _circulation_ is sometimes disturbed. The head becomes giddy,\r\nthe chest oppressed, the pulse hard and frequent—with a sense of\r\nprostration, or, on the contrary, of excitement. These are considered\r\nby the authorities above-mentioned, as precursors of the critical\r\ndischarges, and return of health. In many cases such stormy crises do\r\nnot take place, and the cure is effected gradually and imperceptibly. In\r\npeople of plethoric habits and irritable temperaments, when any of the\r\nforegoing symptoms occur, it is safest to mix the water with some warm\r\nmilk, or allow the carbonic acid gas to escape before it is taken. The\r\nKreuzbrunnen, however, is one of those solvent, and, at the same time,\r\ntonic waters (according to Dr. Heidler) that may be taken by almost every\r\none, whatever the age, sex, or constitution, with little or no danger,\r\neven where there are complications of organic diseases of the heart,\r\nlungs, or great vessels. In such cases, the dilution with warm milk\r\nand the extrication of the gas, will be proper. Dr. Heidler cites the\r\ncase of a young lady who came to Marienbad labouring under sympathetic\r\nhectic fever, and who had had hæmoptysis. The stomach would retain no\r\nfood—especially the dinner. Constipation was obstinate, and nocturnal\r\nperspirations were profuse. The Kreuzbrunn waters were taken, and, after\r\neight days, the fever ceased. In four weeks more the stomach became\r\nretentive. Next Summer, however, she returned to Marienbad, with the\r\nevening vomitings as before. Eight days’ course of the waters dispelled\r\nthe sickness, and she recovered her health. The physicians of Marienbad\r\nexhibit the Kreuzbrunn to people who have had apoplectic attacks,\r\nprovided all symptoms of congestion be removed before the waters are\r\nbegun. In hæmorrhoidal and other sanguineous fluxes, the same source may\r\nbe used; but in moderate quantities.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Kreuzbrunn on the nervous system are much dwelt on\r\nby Dr. Heidler and the other practitioners. They are considered to be\r\nantispasmodic, and are highly praised in the numerous and Proteian forms\r\nof hysteria, hypochondriasis, weakness of stomach, &c. Many patients of\r\nthis kind recover at the Kreuzbrunn, after vainly trying more tonic and\r\nchalybeate springs elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn cases of pure debility, both of body and mind, the more tonic waters\r\nof the Carolinenbrunn (to be presently noticed) are prescribed, together\r\nwith baths of the same. This water is much used in tremors of the limbs,\r\nparalysis from mere weakness, or from losses of blood, excesses, severe\r\nillnesses, distresses of mind, &c. It is to be remembered, however,\r\nthat mere debility is but seldom the cause of these nervous sufferings;\r\nand that the feelings of lassitude and exhaustion, the small pulse,\r\ncold extremities, cramps and spasms, so frequent among hypochondriacs,\r\nare generally symptoms or effects of congestion in the vessels of the\r\nliver and abdominal organs, giving rise to irritation in the nervous\r\nsystem, constipation, and morbid secretions. The classes of people who\r\nbecome hypochondriacal are those who have lived well, both in food and\r\ndrink, and who have led an idle life, mental and bodily. In such, the\r\npathological condition above-mentioned is likely to occur. The action of\r\nthe Kreuzbrunn is eminently calculated to clear away viscid and unhealthy\r\nsecretions, and rouse the circulation of the liver and glandular organs\r\nof the abdomen. The Marienbad physicians employ the Kreuzbrunn in\r\ngravelly complaints, but in small quantities, and with good effects\r\napparently.\r\n\r\nThe physiological action of this water on the lymphatic or absorbent\r\nsystem, is very striking, as might be expected. Tumours of the glands,\r\nespecially if not of long-standing, disappear or greatly diminish during\r\na course of the Kreuzbrunn. Cutaneous complaints are generally cured or\r\nameliorated by the same waters assisted by baths.\r\n\r\nBut it is chiefly in chronic complaints of the abdominal, and\r\nespecially of the digestive organs, that the Kreuzbrunn is\r\nfamous. The symptoms which indicate the use of these waters,\r\naccording to Dr. Heidler and the other physicians of Marienbad,\r\nare the following:—yellow, pale, or cachectic complexion—loss of\r\nappetite—distaste of food—sickness—furred tongue with bitter taste\r\nin the morning—acid or rancid eructations—oppression or cramps about\r\nthe stomach—distention and tenderness of the abdomen, local or\r\ngeneral—colics—kidney-affections—constipation—diarrhœa—dysury—deposits\r\nin the water—irregularities of\r\nfemales—sterility—leucorrhœa—hypochondriasis—hysteria—epilepsy—various\r\nand anomalous nervous affections—headaches of all kinds—giddinesses\r\nand vertigo—noise in the ears—sleeplessness—asthma—anxiety about\r\nthe chest—palpitation of the heart—languor of the muscles—cold\r\nextremities—feeble circulation—atrophy, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. FERDINANDSBRUNN.\r\n\r\nThis spring lies about a mile out of the town, and has a greater\r\naffinity to the Kreuzbrunn than any of the other wells of Marienbad. Its\r\nconstituents are as follow:—In the pint there are 17 grains of sulphate\r\nof soda—7 grains of muriate of soda—6½ carbonate of soda—3 of carbonate\r\nof lime—2 of carb. magnesia—⅓rd of a grain of carbonate of iron—traces of\r\ncarbonates of strontia, manganese, and lithian—in all 36½ grains—with 146\r\ninches of carbonic acid gas to 100 cubic inches of the water.\r\n\r\nFrom the above analysis it will be seen that the Ferdinandsbrunn contains\r\nnearly three times as much steel as the Kreuzbrunn, with considerably\r\nmore of carbonic acid gas; but it contains much less of the sulphates\r\nand muriates of soda. Hence it is more tonic, and less aperient than the\r\nmaster-spring, the KREUZBRUNN. The water is clear and transparent in the\r\nglass—sparkles like champagne—and has a most agreeable refreshing taste.\r\nIt leaves a slight smack of ink on the palate. It may be administered\r\nin the same class of maladies as the Kreuzbrunn is applied to—and that\r\neither simultaneously, alternately, or successively. Thus, where the\r\nsolvent powers of the former spring are still wanted, but the debility\r\nof the patient requiring a more tonic source, the Ferdinandsbrunn may\r\nbe advantageously conjoined with the Kreuzbrunn, or substituted for it\r\nduring a period. It may be as well to cite a case or two here from my\r\nfriend Dr. Heidler.\r\n\r\n“A gentleman, 60 years of age, who had led a sedentary life, and\r\nexperienced much trouble of mind, became extremely hypochondriac.\r\nWhen he arrived at Marienbad, his complexion was cachectic—eyes dull\r\nand sunk—tongue furred—appetite gone—abdomen distended, but not\r\ntender—hæmorrhoids—bowels inactive—discharge of bloody mucus occasionally\r\nwith the motions—some eruption on the skin—slight wandering gouty\r\npains—skin dry—pulse small and slow. The Kreuzbrunn was first tried,\r\nbut produced watery evacuations, and distention of the stomach. The\r\nFerdinandsbrunn was therefore substituted at the end of ten days.\r\nThis water, in conjunction with mud-baths, produced, in the course of\r\nfive weeks, the most salutary effects, clearing the patient of his\r\nhypochondriasis, and nearly the whole of the other symptoms.”\r\n\r\n_Case the second._—“A gentleman, 50 years of age, who had lived\r\nwell, became weak and cachectic after some considerable hæmorrhoidal\r\ndischarges—one of them amounting to several pints of blood in one day.\r\nHe had derived considerable advantage from the waters of Carlsbad the\r\npreceding year, but it increased the intestinal hæmorrhage. On his\r\narrival at Marienbad, he presented the following symptoms:—complexion\r\npale, and inclining to a yellow tint—lips bloodless, as was\r\nthe tongue, and even the palate—swelling of the eye-lids—small\r\nappetite—sleeplessness—rose from bed more fatigued than when he lay\r\ndown—great difficulty of breathing, but without any symptoms of water in\r\nthe chest, on ascending stairs—abdomen distended, but soft, and without\r\ntenderness—constipation and diarrhœa alternately—the pulse feeble and 85\r\nto 95—skin rough and dry.\r\n\r\n“The Kreuzbrunn was tried, but caused oppression at the\r\nstomach—diminution of appetite, and watery evacuations. The\r\nFerdinandsbrunn was then employed, and agreed better, and produced more\r\nconsistent motions, but very unhealthy—some blood was passed each time\r\nfrom the hæmorrhoidal vessels. The appetite soon increased—the digestion\r\nimproved—and sleep became more refreshing. Towards the end of the course,\r\nwhich lasted five weeks, he was able to go up stairs without difficulty.\r\nHe returned two years afterwards to Marienbad, with the same symptoms,\r\nand was again relieved.”\r\n\r\nThe Kreuzbrunn is preferable to the Ferdinandsbrunn, where the invalid is\r\nof sanguine temperament, robust, inclined to apoplexy, or hæmorrhages.\r\nAlso for females who are subject to miscarriages—and, in general, for all\r\nthose who shew a tendency to fulness or congestion in any of the vital\r\norgans—diseases of the chest—derangements of the circulation—inflammatory\r\ncomplaints—and diseases of children.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. CAROLINENBRUNN AND AMBROSIUSBRUNN.\r\n\r\nThese two springs are near each other, and only a few hundred yards\r\ndistant from the Kreuzbrunn. They come under the head of “acidulous\r\nchalybeates,” and only differ from each other in strength—the\r\nCarolinenbrunn being rather more potent than the Ambrosiusbrunn, as the\r\nfollowing analysis will show. The CAROLINENBRUNN contains in the pint of\r\nwater, 2½ grains of sulphate of soda-½ grain muriate of soda—⅔rds of a\r\ngrain of carbonate of soda—nearly a grain of carbonate of lime—3 grains\r\nof magnesia—⅓rd of a grain of carbonate of iron—in all amounting to about\r\n9 grains—and 123 cubic inches of carbonic acid gas in 100 cubic inches of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe AMBROSIUSBRUNN contains only six grains of solid matters in the\r\npint—the iron being only ¼ of a grain. The other ingredients are the same\r\nin kind as in the Carolinenbrunn, but one-third smaller in quantity. The\r\ncarbonic acid gas is also rather smaller in quantity.\r\n\r\nDr. Heidler considers the Ambrosiusbrunn as bearing considerable\r\nanalogy to Bruckenau, Bocklet, and the Stahlbrunn at Swalbach; but\r\nas far as the chemical composition is concerned, there is much\r\ndifference, as may be perceived by reference to those springs. Dr. H.\r\nprefers the Ambrosiusbrunn for children, and also for adults of very\r\nweak and delicate constitutions, as preparatory to the water of the\r\nCarolinenbrunn. It is easy of digestion, and may be taken for a long\r\ntime, without inconvenience. It is very useful in gravelly complaints.\r\n\r\nThe Carolinenbrunn is of more extensive application than the\r\nAmbrosiusbrunn; but much less so than the Kreuzbrunn, or even the\r\nFerdinandsbrunn. Experience has shewn that the “_acidulous chalybeates_,”\r\nwhose properties are exciting and tonic, are much less useful in chronic\r\ndiseases than those which are solvent, and which produce crises in the\r\ncourse of their operation—especially through the medium of the bowels and\r\nthe kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of the Carolinenbrunn on the stomach is excitant\r\nand refreshing, like all other acidulous springs. It has been generally\r\nused by the inhabitants as common drink; and yet it does not digest so\r\neasy, among the invalids, as the other springs of Marienbad—many of them\r\nexperiencing weight and oppression at the epigastrium, particularly\r\nif they are weak and irritable constitutions, or labouring under any\r\ncongestion or engorgement of the abdominal organs. It is much less\r\naperient than the Kreuzbrunn and the Ferdinandsbrunn—indeed it often\r\nconfines the bowels, and then the patient must take some of the other\r\nwaters with the Carolinenbrunn or aperient medicine. This spring is the\r\nstrongest in iron of all the others. It bears the greatest affinity to\r\nSchwalbach and Spa; but is a stronger chalybeate, and contains more\r\ncarbonic acid gas than they do. It leaves an _après-gout_ of steel on the\r\npalate, as also of sulphur.[63]\r\n\r\nThe Carolinenbrunn may be classed amongst the exciting and tonic waters.\r\nIt moderately excites the circulation and the nervous system, by a\r\ntransient stimulation, which does not leave a debility behind. Although\r\nit is not aperient, it rarely produces astringent effects, like bark,\r\nsteel and other tonics. It augments the action of the kidneys—and may\r\nbe said to gently increase the activity of the whole organism, without\r\nchecking any of the secretions. It is therefore prescribed, with much\r\nadvantage, in all cases of pure debility, and unattended with any fever\r\nor local inflammation. Care ought always to be taken that the bowels\r\nare cleared of all impurities before this water is used, and that\r\nconstipation is guarded against during the course. It is used in baths.\r\nThe rules for using the waters are not materially different from those\r\nenforced at other spas. The season lasts from the beginning of May till\r\nthe end of September.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATHS.\r\n\r\nThe baths of Marienbad are on a splendid scale—including the mineral\r\nwater—the gas—and the mud baths. The grand source of the waters for\r\nbathing is the MARIENBRUNN, which furnishes 5280 cubic feet of water in\r\n24 hours. The basin is large and capacious—entirely covered over—and the\r\ncarbonic acid gas boils up in all directions, and in globes and globules\r\nof all sizes, with astonishing vehemence and agitation. The disengagement\r\nof gas here is, in my opinion, much more striking and wonderful than at\r\nthe Cold Sprudel and its neighbour at Franzensbad. There is always a\r\nthick stratum of this deadly gas incumbent on the surface of the water.\r\nThere is an admixture of sulphuretted hydrogen gas with the carbonic.\r\nAll the experiments that are made on animals at the famous Grotto del\r\nCane, near Naples, may be repeated here with perfect success. The\r\nMarienbrunn is more elevated than the bathing-establishments, so that the\r\nwater is conveyed fresh from the source, through pipes that prevent all\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE BATHS.\r\n\r\n1. Soon after entering the bath—say at blood heat—innumerable globules\r\nof carbonic acid gas are seen on the surface of the body. 2. Many people\r\nperceive a redness of the skin, soon after immersion, accompanied by a\r\nsense of heat, even when the bath is not above 88° or 90° of Fahrenheit.\r\n3. Some people of irritable and sensitive constitutions, on the contrary,\r\nexperience a slight shiver, even when the temperature of the water is\r\nabove that of the blood. This phenomenon is, however, rare. 4. The bath\r\noccasions a prompt and copious secretion from the kidneys. 5. Many\r\npeople who have had old wounds, fractures, or ulcers, feel pains in the\r\nparts, while immersed in the water. 6. The same may be said of gout\r\nand rheumatism; and this renewal of pains is considered a favourable\r\nomen. 7. Old and ill-conditioned ulcers soon assume a more healthy\r\nappearance under the use of the baths, and take on a more active, or\r\neven inflammatory condition. Ulcers ought to be covered with oil-silk\r\nor other defence while the patient is in the bath. 8. In the course of\r\nthe bathing—generally after ten or fourteen days, any eruptions that\r\npreviously existed become more developed—and very often new cutaneous\r\neruptions come out. These are considered to be more or less salutary.\r\n\r\nThe Marienbrunn water is much weaker than the Kreuzbrunn and other\r\ndrinking springs, and is soon decomposed by exposure to the atmosphere.\r\nThese baths are contra-indicated, or even prejudicial in cases of dropsy,\r\nphthisis, aneurysms, irritations or inflammations of any important\r\norgan, especially if accompanied by fever or suppuration—disposition to\r\nhæmorrhages, or vomitings of blood—disposition to miscarriage—paralyses\r\nthe result of apoplexy. With these exceptions there are few chronic\r\ndiseases which may not be benefitted by the Marienbad baths in\r\nconjunction with the internal use of the waters.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly, however, in gout, rheumatism, tic-douloureux, paralytic\r\ndebility without preceding apoplexy or affection of the head, scrofula,\r\ncutaneous eruptions, stiffness and contractions of joints, and old sores,\r\nthat the baths of Marienbad are recommended as essential auxiliaries to\r\nthe waters internally. The baths are generally used at a temperature of\r\n94° to 98°, and at any time of the day except when digestion is going on\r\nafter dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUD-BATHS.\r\n\r\nThese are in great requisition at Marienbad. The peat bog is found near\r\nthe spa. It is of a very dark brown colour—friable when dried, and\r\nunctuous to the feel when wetted. It is here, as elsewhere, the product\r\nof vegetable matters decomposed by water, and highly impregnated with\r\ncarbonic acid gas and sulphuretted hydrogen, which gases are disengaged\r\nin prodigious quantities. Much sulphur is found in this earth, together\r\nwith various mineral salts, as hydro-chlorate of soda, sulphate of\r\nsoda—sulphates of lime and magnesia—carbonate of iron—silex—alum—bitumen,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nBesides the general effects of hot, warm, and tepid baths of mineral\r\nwater, the mud-baths exhibit effects peculiar to themselves. They may be\r\ntaken at a higher temperature than water-baths, without inconvenience.\r\nThey are never employed cold. They excite the skin much more than\r\nthe liquid baths,—cause a greater degree of redness—bring out more\r\neruptions—and stimulate the nerves of the surface, as well as the\r\nvessels. They are employed by the Marienbad physicians in all those cases\r\nwhere the mineral-water baths are used. They are preferred, however,\r\nto the latter, in all those maladies where the natural and salutary\r\ncrisis takes place chiefly through the excretories of the surface, and\r\nby determination to the joints, as in gout; and in those cases where the\r\ndisease is attributed to checked perspiration. The mud-baths are much\r\nemployed by Dr. Heidler, Dr. Herzig, and others, as local applications in\r\nvarious local maladies, as, for example, in swellings and stiffness of\r\nthe joints—old wounds—ulcers—neuralgic affections, &c.\r\n\r\nAs the stratum of mud in contact with the body soon loses some of its\r\ncaloric, it is proper and even necessary, to keep moving about in the\r\nbath, and using friction with the hands as well as motion with the limbs.\r\nThe fluid bath, which is placed at the side of the mud-bath, loses\r\ntemperature also, while the bather is in the latter, and as it is often a\r\nmoveable tub, warm water cannot be always added to it—therefore it should\r\nbe two or three degrees higher than usual when operations are commencing.\r\nNo time should be spent in the washing-bath longer than is necessary for\r\ncleaning the surface of the body.\r\n\r\nHaving used the mud-baths both at Franzensbad and Marienbad, and\r\naccurately watched their effects on my own person, I can aver that I\r\nperceived no difference, either in sensible properties or physiological\r\nresults, between the mud-baths of the two places. I always felt more\r\nexhilarated through the day, when I used the mud, than when I took the\r\ncommon mineral-water bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS-BATHS.\r\n\r\nAt Marienbad, as at Franzensbad, the carbonic acid gas rises from the\r\nearth in such abundance, that it is only necessary to inclose a piece\r\nof ground and form a reservoir, when the deadly mephitic gas collects\r\nin such quantities as would destroy the whole population of those spas\r\nin a few minutes! But as the most potent poisons have been converted\r\ninto the most efficient remedies, so has this deleterious emanation from\r\nthe bowels of the earth, been made an instrument for restoring various\r\nlost powers in the human frame. The application of this gas is only of\r\nmodern date. The first notice I have seen is in the Dict. des Sciences\r\nMedicales, 1812. Since then Dr. Heidler, Dr. De Carro, and others have\r\npublished on this subject. The gas-bath was first used at Marienbad about\r\ntwenty years ago, on the following occasion. Dr. Struve, of Dresden, had\r\nbeen using the waters and baths of Marienbad for a painful affection\r\nof the left thigh and leg, which prevented him from walking without\r\ncrutches, and, on any little exertion, caused the most excruciating pain.\r\nA number of lymphatic glands were swelled in the course of the vessels of\r\nthat limb, and the vessels themselves were enlarged and inflamed, though\r\nthe limb was emaciated. He had a gorged liver and hæmorrhoids. He exposed\r\nthe afflicted member daily to the action of the carbonic acid gas, which\r\nalways floats on the surface of the Marienbrunn; and the following were\r\nhis words:—“I soon felt an agreeable warmth creep up the limb exposed to\r\nthe gas, which went on increasing, accompanied by a sense of formication\r\n(creeping of ants) over the skin. After half an hour’s application, on\r\nthe first trial, I removed from the Marienbrunn, by the aid of my servant\r\nand crutches; but my astonishment was great, when I found that I could\r\nput my foot to the ground with increased power, and that the painful\r\ntitillation soon subsided. In the course of a few days the power of the\r\nlimb was so far augmented that I was able to walk without crutches or\r\neven a stick. I continued, however, the Kreuzbrunn water internally—the\r\nmud-poultices to the limb—and the gas-bath for three weeks, when the cure\r\nwas complete and permanent.”[64]\r\n\r\nThis almost miraculous cure attracted Dr. Heidler’s attention to the\r\nsubject, and, from that period, he has made numerous experiments on other\r\npatients, with this new remedy, as well as on himself personally, and\r\npublished the results in the year 1819, at Vienna. The succeeding year\r\nsix gas-bathing chambers were constructed, and now, (August 1840) this\r\ngas-bathing establishment is on the completest scale of perfection. The\r\nCount St. Leu, and Marshal Schwarzenberg, were among the first patients\r\nwho used the gas-baths after their establishment in 1819. The physicians\r\nof Marienbad have, ever since the last-mentioned period, employed this\r\nremedy in a great number of cases and diseases, and, they informed me,\r\nwith great advantage.\r\n\r\nThe sensible effects are chiefly as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A sensation of heat (sometimes preceded by a slight coldness) very\r\nsoon is felt after entering the gas-bath, beginning at the feet and\r\nmounting upwards over the whole body, in the majority of cases, but,\r\nin others, it is most sensibly experienced in those parts of the body\r\nor limbs which are or were the seats of diseases. In the abdomen, and\r\nespecially in the lower parts of the pelvis, this pleasant sensation of\r\nheat is more felt than in the chest—a fact which led to the application\r\nof gas to certain complaints in both sexes attended with torpor and\r\ndebility of particular functions.\r\n\r\n2. A sensation of twitching, formication, and even pain, is often the\r\nresult of the gas-bath, especially in parts which have formerly been\r\nthe seat of fractures, sprains, wounds, or severe gout or rheumatism.\r\nThese pains are so acute as sometimes to force the patient to quit\r\nthe bath before the usual time has expired. On the other hand, most\r\nexcruciating pains of rheumatism, tic, &c. unaccompanied by inflammation,\r\nhave been instantaneously relieved by the application of the gas. 3.\r\nPerspiration is generally produced or augmented by the bath, either at\r\nthe time of immersion, a few hours afterwards, or in the following night.\r\n4. The gas-bath sometimes brings on, at others regulates, periodical\r\ndischarges, hæmorrhoidal or otherwise. 5. The gas-bath is exciting or\r\neven irritating to the organs of respiration, and should not be used\r\nwhere there is any inflammatory action or congestion in the chest. 6. If\r\na certain proportion of the gas gets mixed with the common air, and is\r\nthus breathed, it produces giddiness, vertigo, anguish at the pit of the\r\nstomach, and oppression about the lungs. If the _pure gas_ is breathed,\r\ninstant death is the result. A few years ago the life of a female peasant\r\nwas lost by the stupidity of her husband, who put the cover of the bath\r\nover her head, instead of being round her throat. No one is now allowed\r\nto take a gas-bath without the medical or some experienced attendant.[65]\r\n\r\nThe carbonic acid gas is generally employed here in commixture with a\r\nsmall proportion of sulphuretted hydrogen gas.\r\n\r\nThe mode of action of the gas-bath being decidedly stimulant, it\r\nshould never be employed where stimulants are improper. The disorders\r\nin which it is most employed by Dr. Heidler, Dr. Herzig, and other\r\nphysicians at Marienbad, are the following:—1. Suppressed or scanty\r\nmenstruation—especially after the waters and common baths have been\r\nused without effect. 2. Suppressed hæmorrhoidal discharges, in which\r\nthe mineral waters may also be employed. 3. In scrofulous ulcers\r\nand swellings, aided by the mud-baths and mineral water. 4. Various\r\nderangements of digestion, where there is no plethora of any of the\r\nabdominal organs. 5. In gouty affections of a painful kind, without\r\nactual inflammation, and where the other baths and waters have proved\r\nineffectual. In such cases, the gas-baths often bring out an acid and\r\nfætid perspiration on the pained part. 6. In some chronic affections of\r\nthe sight, as amaurosis, not accompanied by inflammatory symptoms, the\r\nlocal application of the gas has been found useful: also in deafness\r\ndependent on torpor of the nerves and membranes of the ear, or where\r\nthe natural secretion is defective or nul. Great caution, however, is\r\nnecessary in the local application of streams of this gas to the eyes or\r\nears, where there is any tendency to vertigo, or fulness about the head.\r\n\r\nThe gas-baths are taken locally or generally. In the general bath\r\nthe patient should be lightly cloathed, as the gas generally induces\r\nperspiration. When it is used locally, by way of douche, it may often be\r\napplied to the naked part, or with a gauze covering over the surface,\r\nespecially if to the eyes. Care should always be taken to prevent the\r\nintroduction of gas into the lungs—or even into the mouth or nose, lest\r\ndisagreeable consequences should ensue.\r\n\r\nThis new remedy has attracted individuals of both sexes to Franzensbad\r\nand Marienbad, from the wilds of Russia, and from various parts of the\r\nSouth and centre of Europe. Those who come with the greatest anxiety, and\r\nwith the most ardent hopes, or at least expectations, to the gas-baths,\r\nare such as have long sighed, but sighed in vain, to become—\r\n\r\n    “The tenth transmitters of some foolish face,”\r\n\r\nplacing, apparently, more faith in the physical operation of the waters,\r\nbaths, and gases of the spas, than in the intercession of saints or\r\neven the prayers which they had offered up at the shrine of the Madonna\r\nherself! How far and how often the gas-baths have wrought the happy\r\nrevolution, I cannot say. The doctors have firmly asserted, and the\r\npatients have willingly believed the “flattering tale.” As the gas-baths\r\nare seldom trusted to alone, it is impossible to say with accuracy, what\r\nshare they have in the general restoration of health, and the consequent\r\ninvigoration of the constitution. Upon the whole, I left Marienbad with\r\nthe strong conviction on my mind, that its waters and baths were among\r\nthe most efficient in the list of the German spas.\r\n\r\nThe valley of Marienbad is well sheltered, and surrounded by pines in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of the spa; but we have only to mount a couple\r\nof miles on the Carlsbad road, when we get into a high open country,\r\nwith a bracing air and a boundless prospect. Some parts of this route\r\nare extremely picturesque—I would almost say romantic, especially a few\r\nmiles from Marienbad, where the road winds down a precipice in numerous\r\ntourniquets, into a valley surrounded on all sides by steep acclivities,\r\nsome bare and rugged, others crowned with woods. A rivulet roars\r\nthrough the valley, and a village, a convent, and some factories, give\r\ncheerfulness and animation to the scene.\r\n\r\nP.S.—Before quitting the subject of the Marienbad waters, I must dedicate\r\na few lines to a small brochure on these waters, published by my friend\r\nDr. Herzig, in the Summer of 1840.\r\n\r\n    Die Heilung der Krankheiten, mit hulfe des Kreuzbrunnen zu\r\n    Marienbad. Von Dr. L. Herzig.—The Cure of Diseases by the help\r\n    of the Marienbad Waters.\r\n\r\nThe water of the Marienbad springs has a soothing effect on the nervous\r\nsystem, and checks vomiting and pain in the stomach and bowels, in\r\nconsequence partly of the carbonic acid contained in the water, and\r\npartly of its property of increasing all the secretions.\r\n\r\nIn plethoric persons it often proves stimulating, and causes headache,\r\nredness of face, and feelings of cerebral congestion—owing probably to\r\nthe carbonic acid and the iron contained in it.\r\n\r\nIts most marked effect is to increase all the secretions, especially\r\nthose of the bowels, liver, kidneys and skin—large quantities of mucus\r\nare discharged with the stools. The mucous secretions of the bladder, and\r\nalso of the vagina, are usually much increased at first, but subsequently\r\ngreatly diminished, when these organs are in a state of weakness. Various\r\nforms of cutaneous eruption often make their appearance, and rheumatic\r\nand gouty pains are usually increased at first, but subsequently\r\ndisappear during the use of the waters.\r\n\r\nThe digestive and nutritive functions are quickened and invigorated,\r\nand the patients acquire strength and liveliness, in consequence of\r\nthe improved state of the intestinal secretions. The Kreuzbrunn waters\r\nat Marienbad produce similar effects to those of the Carlsbad and the\r\nKissengen waters; but the former are more purging and evacuant, and act\r\nless upon the vascular system, and more upon the digestive functions than\r\nthey do.\r\n\r\nThe diseases in which the Marienbad waters are most useful, are—\r\n\r\n1. All congested states of the _portal_ system of veins, indicated by\r\ntorpid bowels, loss of appetite, hæmorrhoids, and gouty complaints;\r\nand the various diseases connected with inactivity of the abdominal\r\ncirculation, such as hypochondriasis, dyspepsia, morbid sensibility,\r\nheadaches, &c. Numerous cases of chronic rheumatism and gout, which are\r\nso frequently associated with congestion of the vena portæ, are relieved\r\nby the use of the Marienbad waters.\r\n\r\n2. Diseased state of the mucous membranes, such as some obstinate\r\ncatarrhs, affections of the mucous coat of the bladder, uterus, &c.\r\n\r\n3. Plethora, sanguineous congestions, crampy pains of the limbs, absent\r\nor difficult menstruation, and the numerous morbid symptoms dependent\r\nupon this state.\r\n\r\n4. Torpor of the bowels, and its host of attendant evils.\r\n\r\n“By means of its property of increasing all the secretions and excretions\r\nof the body, and of bringing out cutaneous eruptions and gouty affections\r\nto the limbs, the Kreuzbrunn waters at Marienbad are an excellent remedy\r\nin numerous diseases which depend either upon a plethoric state of the\r\nabdominal circulation, or upon the accumulation of impurities in the\r\nbowels, or upon an unhealthy condition of the mucous membranes. At the\r\nsame time, they subdue the morbid irritability of the whole system, or of\r\nindividual parts; they remove congestions, plethora, and various evils\r\ndependent upon these. They are especially useful in all cases where\r\nNature herself seems to be striving to induce either an increase of the\r\nsecretions, or a flow of blood from certain parts, as the nose, anus, &c.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Marienbad waters do not prove sufficiently aperient, a small\r\nportion of Glauber or Epsom salts may be added to it. In some cases, the\r\nwaters will agree better, if previously heated; and in others, they are\r\nusefully combined with a little warm milk, or with a small portion of\r\nwine.\r\n\r\nDr. Herzig is an attentive physician, who speaks English, and may be\r\nusefully consulted by my countrymen. I have also to express my grateful\r\nthanks to Dr. Heidler, the spa physician of Marienbad, for his kindness\r\nand attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARLSBAD.\r\n\r\n              ——fælix per secula mana,\r\n    Fons sacer, humano generique salutifer esto,\r\n    Redde seni validas vires. Pavidæque Puellæ,\r\n    Formosam confer faciem, morbisque medere\r\n    Omnibus, et patrias accedat lætior oras,\r\n    Quisquis in hæc lympha fragiles immerserit artes.[66]\r\n\r\n    Sacred Font! flow on for ever,\r\n      Health on mankind still bestow—\r\n    If a virgin woo thee—give her\r\n      Rosy cheeks and beauty’s glow:—\r\n    If an old man—make him stronger—\r\n      Suffering mortals soothe and save—\r\n    Happier, send them home, and younger,\r\n      All who quaff thy fervid wave!\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is denominated the KING of the Spas, whilst Baden-Baden is the\r\nQUEEN. I wish his majesty of the “WARM WASSERS” had condescended to hold\r\nhis noisy court a little nearer to that of his royal consort. Two hundred\r\nand thirty miles from Frankfort, through a country that is not always\r\nvery smooth, or very interesting—with dust in some places half a foot\r\ndeep on the roads—the thermometer at 80°—and the rate of progression five\r\nmiles an hour, is a tolerable sacrifice to the hygeian goddess of the\r\nSprudel! It is not improbable that many of those who travel to Bohemia,\r\nin search of health, might find it in various other directions, and much\r\nnearer their own doors. The journey itself requires some good stamina, as\r\nwell as resolution, and, if borne well, gives promise of success at the\r\nSprudel.[67]\r\n\r\nI suppose Carlsbad claims the prerogative of curing by the “_Royal\r\ntouch_,” all those maladies that resist the powers of his subject\r\nspas—and even of the Queen’s own at Baden.\r\n\r\nI think I have discovered one cause of the great efficacy of the Carlsbad\r\nwaters, which has escaped the notice of the spa doctors, including my\r\nfriend Dr. Granville. In travelling to Bohemia, the invalid must, on a\r\nmoderate calculation, swallow full a pound of sand and dust on the road.\r\nThis being mixed with an indefinite quantity of grease, oil, and vinegar,\r\nat the hotels, forms a kind of amalgam, resembling “_fuller’s earth_,”\r\nthe clearing away of which, by the hot and alkaline waters of Carlsbad,\r\nmust leave the stomach, liver, kidneys, and other internal organs, as\r\nbright and shining as a newly-scoured copper kettle.\r\n\r\nIt is ascertained that Carlsbad is built on a thin crust of limestone,\r\nforming a dome over several immense cauldrons of boiling mineral water.\r\nAt present the chief crater of this aqueous volcano offers a safety-valve\r\nfor all the superfluous soda-water unconsumed by the subterranean\r\nspa-goers; but it has often been feared that the whole dome may one day\r\nfall in, when the bibbers and bathers, the ramblers and gamblers, the\r\nsick and the sound, will all have a dip in the Sprudel at its natural\r\ntemperature, and without the expense of 48 kreutzers for the bath!\r\n\r\nOn some occasions the usual vent of the Sprudel has become obstructed,\r\nand then the ground in the neighbourhood has trembled and vibrated, as if\r\nfrom an earthquake. At one time the pent up water burst out in the bed of\r\nthe river: and here they have formed a large shield of wood and stones,\r\nclasped with iron, with a plug or safety-valve in the centre, along the\r\nsides of which the steam and water now oozes out, and the aperture can be\r\nenlarged at any moment by removing the plug, when another Sprudel rises\r\nin the middle of the Teple.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, Carlsbad may now be considered as the grand “MAISON DE\r\nSANTÉ” of Europe, where the patients support themselves, on the principle\r\nof the Sanataria in general, and where Mr. Owen might find his social\r\nsystem almost perfect. Thus we have at Carlsbad (and indeed at most of\r\nthe great German spas,) our food in common—our physic in common—and even\r\nour physician in common. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and\r\ngardens and walks where we exercise, are all in common. The socialists\r\nmight even find little reason to complain of that “accursed thing,”\r\nMATRIMONY, for although _matches_ are occasionally projected at Carlsbad,\r\nI believe that _marriage_ is seldom perpetrated there.[68]\r\n\r\nThis great valetudinarium then presents four or five wards or hygeian\r\nfountains, of which the SPRUDEL stands most conspicuous. I was\r\ncompletely disappointed at the first sight of this lion of the Spas.\r\nThe descriptions and drawings of the spring are most outrageously\r\nexaggerated. One would expect to see a fountain of boiling fluid rising\r\nto a height of six or eight feet, and falling down in fervid and foaming\r\nshowers. No such thing. During half the time, it does not rise above the\r\nlevel of the kettle in which it boils; and is often below that mark. Then\r\nit mounts a foot or so, and every now and then spirts a small irregular\r\nand ragged pillar or column of foaming water to a height of two, three,\r\nor perhaps four feet above the reservoir. More frequently, however, it\r\nsquirts a jet of water to one or the other side of the kettle, which\r\nsplashes into the conduits that carry it off. The whole of the kettle,\r\nreservoir, and exits are coated with calcareous deposits, and, in many\r\nparts covered with green matter, the bodies or receptacles of animalculæ.\r\nStill the Sprudel is a stupendous ebullition of hot medicinal water from\r\nsome infernal laboratory, amply sufficient for the expurgation of a whole\r\nnation! The temperature of the water is 168° of Fahrenheit, each pint\r\ncontaining about 44 grains of solid matters, of which the sulphates,\r\ncarbonates, and muriates of soda form 37 grains. A trace, and merely a\r\ntrace, of iron is found in the water. Some very recent analyses have also\r\ndetected traces of iodine, and of an animal substance, together with some\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas. Its taste is certainly not very agreeable and\r\nrather mawkish—and though clear at the fountain, it is turbid when cold.\r\nIt very much resembles the Cockbrunnen in savour.\r\n\r\nThe second spring is the MUHLBRUNN, whose temperature is nearly 30°\r\nbelow that of the SPRUDEL; but whose constituent salts are the same.\r\nNevertheless this difference of temperature is supposed to produce a\r\ndifference in the taste of the water, and renders it more acceptable to\r\nthe stomachs, or at least to the palates, of many of the drinkers at\r\nCarlsbad.[69]\r\n\r\nThe NEUBRUNN is separated from the former source only by a covered walk,\r\nand marks 144° of heat. It did not appear to me to be so much in vogue at\r\nthis fashionable watering-place, as the Muhlbrunnen.\r\n\r\nBehind the Neubrunn there is a hill, cut into terraces and gravelled\r\nwalks, where rises the THERESIENBRUNN—a spring much frequented by the\r\nladies, and indeed by both sexes. The temperature is only 134° of\r\nFahrenheit, and the water is almost tasteless. These three (with the\r\nHygienequelle, close to the Sprudel) are the chief springs, which are\r\nmuch frequented by the great mass of bibbers at Carlsbad.[70]\r\n\r\nThe waters of all the springs deposit abundance of calcareous matters,\r\nwhich crystallize in stalactites of all shapes and hues, called\r\n_Sprudelstein_, and give employment to numerous hands in the formation\r\nof snuff-boxes and various kinds of bijoux.[71] As incrustations form on\r\nthe surfaces of any woody, mineral, or vegetable substance immersed in\r\nthese waters, a fear is sometimes engendered in timid minds that similar\r\nincrustations might form in the stomach, bowels, or kidneys of those\r\nwho drink them! It has been proved by Dr. De Carro and others, that the\r\nstalactitious deposits will not take place on any _animal_ substance,\r\nwith the exception of the teeth. Even here, the quantity of stony matter\r\nis so small in a dozen beakers of the Sprudel, that nothing is to be\r\napprehended to the teeth on this score. It would, perhaps, be a happy\r\ncircumstance for Germany, if the Sprudel had the faculty of encrusting\r\nthe teeth with a calcareous enamel! If such were the case, the whole of\r\nthe five springs at Carlsbad would be insufficient to supply dentrifice\r\nvarnish enough!\r\n\r\nA serio-comic anecdote is related of a hypochondriac, who had drunk of\r\nthese waters for some weeks before the _petrifying_ thought flashed\r\nacross his mind, (in consequence of some uneasy sensations in his\r\nstomach) that incrustations were forming in his interior. From that\r\nmoment he became firmly convinced that snuff-boxes, heads of canes,\r\nMadonnas, and even crucifixes, were torturing his entrails! He drenched\r\nhimself daily with drastic purgatives—but, unfortunately, no stalactites\r\ncame forth: on the contrary, his inward pains and miseries were increased\r\nby the very means that were employed to expel the enemy! Whether he ever\r\nrecovered from his imaginary sufferings is not known.\r\n\r\nAnother source of terror to the timid and nervous drinkers at Carlsbad\r\nhas lately arisen. A learned German philosopher has discovered living\r\nfossil animalculæ in the waters of Carlsbad. Now if these little\r\nsalamanders can “live and move, and have their being,” in the Sprudel at\r\na temperature of 167°—or rather in the bowels of the earth, where the\r\nwater is at the boiling point, or even in the form of steam, it may well\r\nbe supposed that they would thrive luxuriously in the temperate climate\r\nof the human stomach, where the heat does not exceed 98° of Fahrenheit.\r\nHowever, the drinkers of the Thames water need have no fears respecting\r\nthe INFUSORIA of Carlsbad, which would soon be devoured by the proteiform\r\nmonsters which are daily ingurgitated by the citizens of London.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that some of the philosophic spa doctors have\r\nbroached the doctrine, that mineral waters are merely _secretions_ from\r\none great watery being residing deep in the bowels of the earth! As the\r\nsecretions from the human body are very various, so the secretions from\r\nthe mother Spa are almost innumerable, and thus the infinite variety of\r\nmineral waters is readily explained and accounted for. Q. E. D.[72]\r\n\r\nThe situation of Carlsbad is very picturesque—I might say romantic. It\r\nmight be pretty well characterised by a single line, descriptive of a\r\nvery different locality—the valley of the UPAS TREE:\r\n\r\n    “Rocks rise on rocks and fountains gush between.”\r\n\r\nThe town is built partly in the valley, partly on the ledges of granite\r\nrocks that rise abruptly behind it, to a height of 1500 feet, while the\r\nlazy TEPLE—\r\n\r\n    “Slow as Lethe’s stream,”\r\n\r\ncreeps at a snail’s space through the vale, contrasting remarkably with\r\nthe boisterous, foaming, upheaving, and boiling SPRUDEL, that gushes from\r\nunknown and unfathomable depths in the bowels of the earth, carrying\r\nhealth and life to its unnumbered votaries.\r\n\r\nCarlsbad cures, as a matter of course, nine-tenths of human maladies;\r\nbut as King of the Spas, it has a royal prerogative of a curious and\r\nimportant nature—namely, the power of curing those diseases which\r\nresist the virtues of all other spas and all other remedies! In answer\r\nto a question, “why Carlsbad sustained its reputation undiminished?”\r\nHUFELAND replied—“C’est qu’il guérit des maux rebelles a tout autre moyen\r\ncuratif.” It is true that, if we take the testimonies of the other spas,\r\nnone of which admit their fallibility in any case, this prerogative of\r\nCarlsbad would be little more than a sinecure; but the promises of spa\r\ndoctors, like the waters which they prescribe, must be taken _cum grano\r\nsalis_; and we may safely conclude that some maladies present themselves\r\nat the Sprudel which have resisted the Cockbrunnen, as well as many other\r\nbrunnens between the Rhine and the Danube.[73]\r\n\r\nThe attestations to the power of the Carlsbad prerogative would fill\r\na volume. One just before me, as recorded by Dr. Granville, on the\r\nauthority of a British nobleman, well known in the world of wit, is\r\nworthy of notice. Lord A——, it appears, through the efficacy of the\r\nCarlsbad waters, “had lost a _pleuritic adhesion_ under the sternum (or\r\nbreast bone) the consequence of neglected inflammation in the chest,\r\nwhich had annoyed him for a long time, and resisted all curative means.\r\nThe complaint made him short-breathed in ascending hills, and gave him\r\na dragging sensation whenever he sneezed—all which symptoms have since\r\ndisappeared.”\r\n\r\nWhether his lordship’s breathing, and consequently his years, have been\r\nlengthened by the dissolution of substernal _adhesions_, or by certain\r\n_corporate reforms_ effected by the Sprudel, may admit of some doubt;\r\nbut the narrative shews on what sort of evidence the miracles of the\r\nspas sometimes rest! Not that this evidence is worse than we have often\r\nat home—witness the attestation on oath by a nobleman, that he saw St.\r\nJohn Long extract quicksilver from the brain of a man who had taken\r\nmercury—and the solemn assertions of grave and learned doctors, that an\r\nIrish girl could see through her navel, and hear with the points of her\r\nfingers!!\r\n\r\nIf we estimate the number of cures by the number of candidates, this spa\r\nmust be “a sovereign remedy” for many of our ills. But this criterion\r\nis not always correct. It is not always the physician who sees most\r\npatients that cures most diseases. But Carlsbad, like other bads, has\r\na very convenient postern to retreat through, when hard pressed for\r\ntestimonials. Thus, if the first season fails, the most confident hopes\r\nare held out that the second will succeed. If the second turn out a\r\nmiscarriage, then the third will prove infallible! It requires no ghost\r\nto prophesy that, if the pilgrim of the spas goes two successive years\r\nto Bohemia, without relief, the third pilgrimage will, in all human\r\nprobability, be to that “undiscovered country,” whence no invalids return\r\nto tell their tale of disappointment! If a patient die at home, it is\r\nbecause he did not visit Carlsbad—if at Carlsbad, because he came too\r\nlate.\r\n\r\nThe waters of Carlsbad were formerly used almost entirely as baths—but\r\nnow it is just the reverse—they are chiefly taken internally. In former\r\ntimes the bathers passed eight or ten hours in the baths, as they now do\r\nat Leuk, Baden, and Pfeffers. My friend De Carro thinks that, formerly,\r\ncutaneous complaints were more rife—and now, that liver and stomach\r\naffections are the prevailing maladies—hence the change from bathing to\r\ndrinking at this celebrated spa. There may be some truth in this. The\r\ntaste of these waters very much resembles that of weak chicken-broth,\r\nwith a flat and alkaline savour. It has been seen that SODA, combined\r\nwith sulphuric, muriatic, and carbonic acids, is the chief agent in the\r\nCarlsbad waters. Soda uncombined with acids, either out of or in the\r\nbody, has rather a deleterious effect on the organs of circulation and\r\ndigestion. “But the Carlsbad water (says Chev. De Carro) though used for\r\na long time, reanimates, vivifies, excites the appetite, and promotes\r\ndigestion—thus with proper regimen, restoring the patient to health.”\r\nDoubtless the efficacy of the waters is augmented by the admixture,\r\nhowever small in quantity, of other elements, as the oxide of iron, the\r\ncarbonic acid, the iodine, and materials yet unknown, diffused in extreme\r\nsolution, through a fluid of a very high temperature, which enables the\r\ncomponent parts of the spring to permeate the minutest vessels of the\r\nbody. The Carlsbad salts are found in the renal secretion, as well as in\r\nthe cutaneous transpiration, after being taken internally. These waters\r\nact by exciting the stomach, bowels, kidneys, liver, and abdominal\r\norgans generally, augmenting the secretions and excretions—especially\r\nthose of the intestines, sometimes it is said even to purgation, when\r\nthey are taken in considerable quantity. This effect, however, must be\r\nrather unfrequent, for I found no one, including myself, who experienced\r\nit. “They excite the circulation, so as frequently to produce palpitation\r\nof the heart, and determination of blood to the head. This water augments\r\nthe activity of the absorbents; but it is not till after its other\r\noperations, that it acts as a direct TONIC.” Purgation is not considered\r\nby the Carlsbad doctors as essential to its beneficial agency, which is\r\noften produced without any action on the bowels, but only on the various\r\nsecretions already mentioned. In all cases, however, it is necessary\r\nto guard against constipation, by adding some Carlsbad salts to the\r\nwater, or exhibiting some other aperient. Although these waters contain\r\nno sulphuretted hydrogen gas, or extremely little, they produce fætid\r\neructations from the stomach when drunk—but they have not a corresponding\r\neffect on the alvine evacuations. “The operation of the Carlsbad\r\nwaters, in fact, is what is called ‘_alterative_,’ or ‘_deobstruent_;’\r\nand as such they are applicable to a long list of maladies arising\r\nfrom congestion or obstruction in the abdominal organs, particularly\r\nthe liver, spleen, mesentery and other glandular viscera, attended by\r\ndebility of the stomach, heart-burn, acidity, distention, eructations,\r\nconstipation, jaundice, biliary concretions, hypochondriasis,\r\nhæmorrhoids, head-aches, giddiness, gouty feelings, cutaneous eruptions,\r\nscrofula, and urinary obstructions.”[74]\r\n\r\nThis is an encouraging picture, but I have no reason to consider it as\r\novercharged. Dr. De Carro observes, that it is impossible to explain\r\nthe _modus operandi_ of such simple and minute ingredients on the human\r\norganism. “Whoever, he remarks, has experienced a crisis (called also the\r\nspa fever—the bad-sturm, &c.) in his own person, will never doubt the\r\npower of the Carlsbad waters.”\r\n\r\nDr. De C. compares the action of the Carlsbad waters on the human frame\r\nto a good filter that separates all impurities from the constitution.\r\n\r\n“Hypochondriacal affections appear nowhere under more various forms\r\nthan at Carlsbad; and the misanthropic and pusillanimous feelings of\r\nthose unfortunate beings, passing, without known motives, from hope\r\nto despondency, from moroseness to exaltation, deserve the greatest\r\nindulgence and sympathy. When we see so many hepatic and splenetic\r\npatients whose temper depends entirely on the state of their abdominal\r\nfunctions, we feel disposed to forgive the materialism of the ancients,\r\nwho placed the seat of so many passions in the liver; we remember\r\nunwillingly the _Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur_, the _jecur\r\nulcerosum_ of Horace, as synonymous of _jealousy_ and _violent love_, and\r\nwe understand how they could say that men _splene rident, felle irascunt,\r\njecore amant, pulmone jactantur, corde sapiunt_.”\r\n\r\nThe worthy Doctor deplores the disappointments and mortifications which\r\nmany invalids from far distant lands annually experience here, when they\r\nlearn, to their grief and dismay, that the mineral waters are totally\r\ninapplicable to their maladies! They have then only the alternative\r\nof laying their bones in Bohemian soil, or undertaking another long,\r\nfatiguing, and expensive journey towards their native land. Dr. De\r\nCarro blames the ignorance which prevails among the faculty generally,\r\nrespecting the medicinal properties of the Carlsbad and other spas. But\r\nthe spa doctors themselves, and spa tourists, are not entirely blameless.\r\nThe exaggerated accounts that are published respecting the _miraculous_\r\npowers of almost every spa in Germany, are quite sufficient to mislead\r\npractitioners and patients who have no personal knowledge of these\r\nvaunted springs. One great object of the present volume is the attempt\r\nto sift the grain from the chaff, or to filter these waters and depurate\r\nthem of their gross crudities and absurdities.\r\n\r\n“The Carlsbad waters (says Dr. De C.) are detrimental when there are any\r\nsymptoms of inflammation, congestion, or vertigo present. If these exist\r\non the arrival of the invalid, they must be removed before he takes the\r\nwaters; if they occur during the use of the waters, these last must be\r\nimmediately discontinued.”\r\n\r\nDr. De C. observes, that these springs are detrimental in phthisis or\r\nany grade of pulmonary complaint—and that, in general, they aggravate\r\n_organic_ diseases of all kinds, and hasten their march. Here then is a\r\nrule which applies to many of the spas besides Carlsbad—namely, that the\r\nconstitution should be free from inflammation, congestion, and structural\r\nchanges in any organ, before the waters can be safely taken. Dropsical\r\naffections, even where no organic disease can be detected as their cause,\r\nare aggravated by the Carlsbad waters. Dr. De C. relates a melancholy\r\ninstance of a nobleman who was sent there from a great distance—only to\r\ndie of dropsy.\r\n\r\nIn chlorotic and amenorrhœal disorders, Carlsbad waters are beneficial;\r\nnot so much from the minute quantity of iron they contain, as from their\r\nstimulant and deobstruent qualities. Females ought not to use these\r\nwaters at all times.\r\n\r\nA painful complaint which often presents itself at Carlsbad is _biliary\r\ncalculi_. Dr. De C. thinks that the waters are almost specific in such\r\ncases. He lately attended an invalid who had come from a great distance\r\nto Carlsbad. On the third day of using the waters a prodigious number of\r\ngall-stones, of all sizes, were expelled. He has often found gravel to\r\nbe expelled from the kidneys and bladder during the use of these waters;\r\nbut he does not vouch for their _lithontriptic_ powers—that is, their\r\npower of _dissolving_ urinary calculi, although this quality has been\r\nattributed to them by some physicians.\r\n\r\nIt is in chronic gout, especially of the wandering and misplaced kind,\r\nthat the Carlsbad waters have acquired considerable renown, disputing\r\nthe palm with Wisbaden itself. It is in general necessary to take some\r\nchalybeate waters, in such cases, after the course at Carlsbad is\r\ncompleted. It is acknowledged by Sir John De Carro, that more than one\r\nvisitation to Carlsbad will be necessary in gouty affections of any\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nIn the nervous tremors occasioned by quicksilver, these waters have been\r\nfound very beneficial, both internally and externally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARLSBAD STURM, OR CRISIS.\r\n\r\nFrom the age of 35 years, Dr. De Carro was subject to severe attacks of\r\ngout, each attack generally lasting ten or fifteen days, followed by\r\nmuch debility, with great tenderness of the feet. The intervals were\r\nof various duration—sometimes months—sometimes years. The complaint\r\nis hereditary in his family for four generations. About fifteen years\r\nago (1825) one of the paroxysms ceased suddenly on the third day,\r\nfollowed by alarming symptoms—difficulty of breathing—irritation about\r\nthe throat—total loss of sleep—copious muco-purulent expectoration,\r\nof an acrid and acid taste—rapid emaciation—cadaverous expression of\r\ncountenance—and all the symptoms of approaching laryngeal phthisis. From\r\nthese, however, he gradually emerged; but a sense of constriction in\r\nthe trachea remained, occasioning loss of voice and many uncomfortable\r\nfeelings. In April 1826, many of the symptoms above-mentioned returned,\r\nwith considerable violence, and the Dr. removed from Vienna to Carlsbad.\r\nThe waters of this spa are not beneficial in pulmonic complaints\r\ngenerally, but Dr. De C. considered his own malady as misplaced gout,\r\nand he commenced the waters on the 17th of May, at the Neubrunn. “During\r\nthe first three days he felt no effect whatever. He had been unable to\r\nget higher than seven goblets daily; but, on the fourth day, he felt as\r\nif he were drunk—lost his appetite—staggered on his legs—had indistinct\r\nvision—burning cheeks—excited and agitated circulation—overwhelming\r\ndrowsiness, and total inability to read or write. These violent\r\nsymptoms continued for three days, and were _much mitigated by copious\r\nevacuations_, (tres soulagé par des evacuations copieuses) and, the storm\r\nhaving subsided, he continued the course of waters for six weeks, without\r\nfurther inconvenience. The bowels became regular, and there was a copious\r\nbut fætid secretion from the kidneys during the whole time. All the\r\nsymptoms of misplaced gout disappeared.”[75]\r\n\r\nDr. De C. observes that, had he not been a physician, he would have\r\nlooked upon the above symptoms as forerunners of apoplexy. I am quite\r\nconfident that they were so, and that the apoplexy was warded off by the\r\n“copious evacuations” that were procured, whether by nature or art. I\r\nhave seen several instances of this “BAD-STURM,” and have no doubt of\r\ntheir being owing to some inflammatory action going on in some part\r\nof the body (as was clearly the case in the present instance), or to\r\nthe neglect of aperient medicine taken in conjunction with the waters.\r\nThe misplaced gout, such as Dr. De C. presented, is readily relieved by\r\nsaline aperients, with small doses of colchicum and counter-irritation,\r\nwithout the risk of the “BAD-STURM,” which is a violent conflict between\r\nthe constitution and the remedy. It is when the complaint is quiescent,\r\nand all inflammatory symptoms removed, that the Carlsbad and other\r\nmineral waters are beneficial.\r\n\r\nDr. De Carro has a short chapter on the East and West Indian invalids who\r\nresort to Carlsbad annually, for the relief of broken-down constitutions,\r\nand especially for affections of the liver, the spleen, and for the\r\nconsequences of intermittent and remittent fevers contracted within\r\nthe tropics. The worthy doctor, who has the usual dread of mercury, so\r\nwidely infecting the Continental faculty, seems to hint pretty broadly\r\nthat many of the Anglo-Oriental and Occidental diseases, are as much\r\nowing to the remedies as to the climate. Be this as it may, he gives the\r\npagoda-complexioned gentry great hopes of benefit from the waters of the\r\nSprudel.\r\n\r\nThe regime laid down by Dr. De Carro, is rather more liberal than by\r\nsome of his confreres at the German Spas. Breakfast should not be taken\r\ntill an hour after finishing the last goblet. Besides the exercise\r\nwhich is taken while drinking the waters, he recommends half an hour’s\r\npromenade after leaving the spring, if the patient be not too fatigued.\r\nThe breakfast itself may be coffee, tea, or chocolate, according to\r\nthe habits or inclinations of the invalid. Coffee is rather hazardous\r\nwhere there is any tendency to inflammatory action in the constitution.\r\nThe bread and the cream are excellent at Carlsbad. _Dejeuners a la\r\nfourçhette_ are inadmissible here. The dinners at Carlsbad are very\r\nabstemious, as the TRAITEURS are obliged to regulate them by the orders\r\nof the faculty. They present no temptation to commit excesses. A very\r\ntemperate use of plain and well-boiled vegetables is permitted. Salads,\r\ncheese, herrings, anchovies, and all raw fruit are strictly forbidden.\r\nThe supper should be a little soup—and the time of going to bed is ten\r\no’clock at the latest. Gambling is forbidden. The beer of the place, and\r\nlight wines are permitted. The Bohemian, Hungarian, and Austrian wines\r\nare wholesome; but those of the Rhine, the Rhone, and Moselle may be\r\nused. It is recommended to keep the mind tranquil and contented! Alas!\r\nthe prescription is easily written, but what pharmacy can supply the drug?\r\n\r\nThe season at Carlsbad extends from the first of May till the 30th of\r\nSeptember. It is divided into three epochs. From the 1st of May till\r\nthe 15th June, those who love quietude, economy, and health, will go to\r\nthe spa. From the latter period till the middle of August, when the air\r\nis nearly as hot as the waters, CARLSBAD swarms, like a bee-hive, with\r\nlegions of invalids and their friends, who lead, as Dr. De Carro says,\r\n“une vie bruyante,” and pay handsomely for their accommodations. The\r\nlast six weeks, like the first, are more quiet, cool, and reasonable in\r\nexpense. Those, too, who are anxious to have long interviews with their\r\ndoctors, and pour out all their complaints into his attentive ear, will\r\navoid the hot and fashionable season, and prefer the beginning or end.\r\n\r\nIt is remarked by Dr. De C. that a considerable number of people annually\r\nresort to Carlsbad without any other complaint than constipation of the\r\nbowels, obliging them to be constantly taking aperient medicine. “The\r\nwaters of Carlsbad generally establish the regularity of the bowels, and\r\nduring their use no aperient medicine whatever should be taken.” As the\r\ncauses of constipation are chiefly sedentary avocations, there is little\r\ndoubt but that a journey to Bohemia, and the waters of the Sprudel, will\r\ngenerally obviate this troublesome complaint or inconvenience; but I\r\ngreatly doubt whether the Carlsbad waters will prevent its return, when\r\nthe causes come again into operation.\r\n\r\nHere our worthy author enters his protest against the codes of minute\r\ninstructions which are often issued by far distant practitioners, who\r\nhave no personal knowledge of the spas, for the guidance of the patients,\r\nand by which they are often led into great errors or even dangers, by\r\nneglecting to consult some physician on the spot, respecting the proper\r\nwaters to drink and the best mode of taking them. All indeed that the\r\ndistant physician ought to do is, to investigate well the complaint, and\r\nrecommend such spa as he deems proper, leaving the details of application\r\nto the discretion of the medical practitioner on the spot.[76]\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Dr. De Carro, many monographs on the Carlsbad\r\nwaters have appeared by different authors, some of which have been\r\nnoticed in the annual ALMANACK of Carlsbad, composed and published by\r\nDr. De Carro himself. This little annual is of a miscellaneous nature,\r\ncombining amusement with information, and never omitting _one particular_\r\nitem—a list of all the visitors, with their titles, avocations, rank, and\r\n_celebrity_—where there is any fame. It may be as well to glance at some\r\nof these monographs, so as to pick out as much information from them as\r\nwe can.\r\n\r\nDr. Bamberg, of Berlin, published a paper on the modern practice of\r\nCarlsbad, in the year 1835, from which I shall collect a few facts\r\nor opinions. Dr. B. was astonished to find at least ten drinkers at\r\nthe NEUBRUNN or MUHLBRUNN for one at the “Old Man of the Valley,” the\r\nsplendid SPRUDEL. The Theresebrunn too, was not less frequented than her\r\nsister Naiads. It appears that a spa-doctor, now dead, had denounced the\r\nSprudel as a most dangerous water on account of its high temperature, and\r\nprejudicing the visitors against it, by alleging, when other arguments\r\nfailed, that it mounted up to the head with the same force and velocity\r\nwith which it springs from its hidden source! The prejudice was\r\nerroneous. All the waters are from the same source, and the temperature\r\nof the Sprudel is generally as low as that of the others before it\r\nreaches the stomach. The Carlsbad doctors, however, are often greatly\r\nteazed by the directions brought by visitors from their own physicians,\r\nrespecting the particular springs which they are to use. Some prejudice\r\nstill hangs over the Sprudel, and that it is generally looked upon as of\r\nsuperior power to the others, is proved by the character of the drinkers\r\nthere. The sick are more seriously ill—their aspects more sinister—and\r\ntheir figures more demonstrative of organic diseases at the Sprudel than\r\nelsewhere. But fashion comes in to the aid of prejudice. The Archipelago\r\nformed by the Neubrunn, Muhlbrunn, and Theresebrunn, is decorated so\r\nelegantly, and the temperature so drinkable, as the water rises from its\r\nsource, that we need not wonder at the multitudes that crowd around them,\r\nespecially when the physicians assure their patients that the waters of\r\nthese fountains are precisely the same as the Sprudel.\r\n\r\nThe Sprudel possesses two very curious and clashing properties—that of\r\ncreating stony concretions where they did not previously exist, and of\r\ndissolving them when already formed—like the famous sword of antiquity,\r\nwhose rust healed the wound inflicted by its edge. The Carlsbad waters\r\nhave the power of dissolving calculi in the human bladder, and are much\r\nresorted to for that purpose. Dr. Bigel, of Warsaw, has published his own\r\ncase, in a letter to Dr. De Carro, some particulars of which may here be\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nDr. B. became affected with calculus after the age of 60 years, having\r\npreviously passed several renal calculi, and was operated on by the\r\nlithotritic apparatus. The stone was smashed, but several of the\r\nfragments could not be discharged afterwards. He was then conveyed in\r\na kind of litter many hundreds of miles to Carlsbad, where he took the\r\nwaters under the direction of Dr. De Carro. On the third day of taking\r\nthe Theresebrunn, and that in small quantities, Dr. B. became affected\r\nwith fever, such as he experienced after the operation of lithotrity.\r\nThis was relieved by copious perspirations. Returning to the waters, a\r\nsimilar attack of fever was kindled up on the fifth day—but with it the\r\nexpulsion of several fragments of stone, and much solace in the organ.\r\nThe fragments, which had hitherto been of a dark brown colour, were now\r\nwhite, and their surfaces smooth and polished. The white colour was\r\nfound to penetrate to some depth from the surface. Dr. B. changed from\r\none spring to another of higher temperature, till he finished with the\r\nSprudel. At each of the sources he passed pieces of stone, and after\r\ntheir disappearance for a fortnight, the bladder was explored, and no\r\nmore calculi were discoverable. All uneasiness in the bladder ceased from\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nDr. Creutzburg made some experiments on urinary calculi subjected to the\r\naction of the Carlsbad waters, and the results appear to be favourable\r\nto the idea that these waters are beneficial in calculous complaints. And\r\nnow, when lithotrity is so frequently employed, instead of lithotomy,\r\nthese waters may prove eminently useful in polishing and softening the\r\nfragments left after the operation.\r\n\r\nBut the waters of Carlsbad do not limit their powers to the solution or\r\nexpulsion of vesical calculi; they have done wonders in people afflicted\r\nwith biliary concretions. Dr. De Carro had a patient, aged 40 years,\r\nwho evacuated daily, by means of the waters, not only large quantities\r\nof gravel, but numbers of gall-stones, of various shapes and sizes.\r\nLiver-complaints occupy a considerable figure among the maladies which\r\nare treated at Carlsbad—and biliary calculi are very frequently observed\r\nthere. Dr. De Carro has related numerous instances where the baths and\r\nthe waters of Carlsbad have appeared to dislodge the gall-stones, and\r\ncarry them off by the bowels.\r\n\r\nThe Carlsbad baths, which are now much more used than formerly, often\r\nbring forward masked gout, rheumatism, or neuralgic pains that had lain\r\nmore or less dormant in the constitution for months or years.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting these celebrated waters, I must take a short notice of a\r\nlittle work just published by a rising young physician of Carlsbad, whose\r\nacquaintance I had the pleasure of making there.\r\n\r\n    (_From the Medico-Chirurgical Review._)\r\n\r\n    Geschichte von Karlsbad. Von Dr. Hlawaczek.—History of Carlsbad.\r\n\r\nThe learned author gives a most elaborate account of almost every work\r\nthat has been published on these famous waters, since their discovery\r\nby the Emperor Charles IV. in the sixteenth century. His book is, in\r\nshort, a catalogue raisonnée of the writings of his predecessors. The few\r\npractical observations contained in it may be thus stated:\r\n\r\nThe medicinal powers of the Carlsbad waters are the following:\r\n\r\n1. They invigorate the primæ viæ, and dislodge from them all impurities\r\nand accumulations. Hence in various forms of dyspepsia, arising from\r\na sedentary life, from torpor of the bowels, &c. they are especially\r\nuseful; also in chronic jaundice, obstinate head-aches accompanied with\r\nconstipation, &c.\r\n\r\nWith such patients the use of the Carlsbad waters often act as an emetic\r\nfor the first day or two.—Corpulent indolent persons, who feed too much\r\nand take little exercise, are always benefitted.\r\n\r\nIn all obstructed and infarcted states of the abdominal viscera, the\r\nuse of the Carlsbad waters may be recommended. Hence, in many cases\r\nof hypochondriasis and hæmorrhoids, they are beneficial: also in\r\nenlargements of the liver, spleen, and mesenteric glands.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these maladies, we may enumerate many cases of\r\namenorrhœa and dysmenorrhœa—diseases which are so often dependent upon\r\naccumulations in the bowels and general torpor and plethora of the system.\r\n\r\n2. The Carlsbad waters have the effect of freeing the blood of\r\nacrimonious particles, either by neutralising and discharging them out of\r\nthe body, or by causing a metastasis and derivation of them to the joints\r\nor to the skin. Hence in various forms of _internal_ gout and rheumatism,\r\nthey are singularly useful; the disease being often drawn from the\r\ninternal viscus which may happen to be affected to some outward part.\r\n\r\n3. The Carlsbad waters cleanse the urinary passages of calculous deposits.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, they often effect a cure in a number of anomalous diseases,\r\nwhose causes are not known, and to which indeed, a name cannot be given;\r\nas, for example, loss of power and feeling in the limbs, a tendency to\r\nsyncope followed by cramps, some cases of epilepsy and asthma; also in\r\ncertain disturbances of the mental functions. In all these cases, the\r\nCarlsbad waters seem to act as an _alterative_.\r\n\r\nThe venerable _Hufeland_ published in 1815, a treatise on the chief\r\nmedicinal springs in Germany. He recommends the use of the Carlsbad\r\nwaters in cases of constipation, tympanites, incipient disorganisation\r\nof the stomach and bowels and other abdominal viscera, more especially\r\nof the liver, of chronic jaundice, of congestion of the mesenteric and\r\nportal veins; also in nervous ailments, as amaurosis, hypochondriasis,\r\nand in various forms of calculous disease. He also strongly recommends\r\nthem in most of the forms of gout. The Carlsbad waters, in addition to\r\ntheir purgative qualities, are possessed of remarkable alterative powers,\r\nso that often they effect quite a change in the state of the blood and\r\nother fluids of the body, depriving them of all acrimonious and hurtful\r\nparticles, and restoring them to a condition of health. Hence their\r\nstriking utility in numerous cases of cachexia, which are irremediable by\r\nordinary medical treatment.—HLAWACZEK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALETUDINARIUM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is often more easy to ascertain the internal condition of the body\r\nthrough the medium of external phenomena, than that of the mind through\r\nthe physiognomy of the countenance. To the experienced observer, the\r\ncomplexion, the expression, the eye, the gait, the tone of voice, the\r\nfigure, the proportion of the different parts of the body, and many other\r\nindications incapable of description, convey very authentic information\r\nrespecting the condition of organs and structures that are far removed\r\nfrom sight. It is in a great SANITARIUM like this, where invalids are\r\ngathered from all quarters of the world, that a young physician, under\r\nthe guidance of an old one, might beneficially study the _physiognomy_\r\nof diseases. For, although the greater number of spas have much that is\r\ncommon, both as respects the waters and the maladies for which they are\r\ntaken, yet each spa, or at least, each class of spas, exhibits some\r\ncharacteristic features among the mass of visitors, indicative of the\r\nmaladies which led them to the Hygeian fountains of the place. Thus it\r\nis impossible to stand long at the FONTAINE ELISÉE of Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\nwithout discerning a large sprinkling of cutaneous complaints, however\r\ncarefully they may be concealed by the wearers of them. It is in vain\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n    “Wrapp’d in his robe white LEPRA hides his stains,”\r\n\r\nthe features of the LEPER disclose the worm that torments him by day\r\nand by night. The French and Germans are universally imbued with the\r\ndoctrine that the repression of a certain malady, which has got the\r\nmusical soubriquet of “SCOTCH-FIDDLE,” is the cause of half the evils\r\nto which flesh is heir. On this account, the continental folks have a\r\ngreat longing, or rather a violent _itching_ for sulphureous waters.\r\nThe slightest odour of sulphuretted hydrogen gas in a newly-discovered\r\nspring, is a real treasure—and in the old ones, it is sure to preserve\r\nreputation to endless ages!\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring mineral source—SPA—together with SCHWALBACH, BROCKENAU,\r\nBOCKLET, and other chalybeate springs, attract a different class of\r\nvotaries—namely, the pallid, the debilitated, the leucophlegmatic—those,\r\nin fact, who have been sucked, and left bloodless by vampyre diseases.\r\n\r\nThe emblem of WISBADEN might be a swelled and gouty foot—that of WILDBAD\r\na crutch, or a hobbling paralytic invalid—KISSENGEN, the tumid liver and\r\ngreen fat—MARIENBAD, the paunch of Falstaff, and the jaundiced eye.\r\n\r\nBut CARLSBAD presents a greater medley than any of the other spas that I\r\nhave visited. When we contemplate, even for a single morning, the crowds\r\nthat surround the Sprudel alone, presenting specimens of almost every\r\nhuman infirmity, not in solitary cases, but often in trains of twenties\r\nor thirties in succession—when we consider that, in these various\r\nspecimens, there are many that are of a diametrically opposite nature\r\nto each other—yet all cured or relieved by an upheaving fountain that\r\nnever varies in temperature, taste, or composition—doubts may well arise\r\nwhether there is not some truth in the sarcastic remark of an eminent\r\nphilosopher,—that “there are more false _facts_ than false _theories_\r\nin physic.”—But there is something to be said PER CONTRA. 1st. Many\r\ncomplaints which are thought and believed to be cured by mineral waters,\r\nare only _relieved pro tempore_—and the contradiction seldom or never\r\nappears. 2d. Many different diseases are produced by the _same causes_\r\nacting on different constitutions. Thus luxurious living and idleness\r\nwill, in one person, induce gout—in a second, hæmorrhoids—in a third,\r\nliver complaint—in a fourth, rupture of a bloodvessel in the lungs—in a\r\nfifth, congestion in the brain—in a sixth, paralysis—in a seventh, stone\r\nin the kidney or bladder,—and the list might be far extended. Now, if\r\nthe same cause or class of causes produce such a number of different\r\nmaladies; there is nothing unreasonable in the supposition that the same\r\nremedy, or class of remedies, may be useful in abating or even removing\r\nthose varied disorders.\r\n\r\n3d. With the exception of a few specific remedies, such as mercury,\r\nsulphur, colchicum, and ergot, with the real nature of whose\r\nphysiological operation on the human frame little is known, almost all\r\nthe other medicinal agents act through the medium of the digestive\r\norgans, the liver, the kidneys, and the skin. Now, the mineral waters of\r\nsuch spas as Wisbaden, Kissengen, Marienbad, Carlsbad, &c. act through\r\nthese organs also, and contain the elements of many of our most efficient\r\nremedies. They have, besides, great advantages over ordinary medicines at\r\nhome, in consequence of the exercise of travelling, the change of air,\r\nand the alteration of habits that precede the course of the waters.\r\n\r\n4. Through what channels do the noxious _physical_ agents enter the\r\nconstitution and produce disease? Through the digestive organs and skin,\r\nwithout doubt,—to which may be added the lungs, which may imbibe the\r\nprinciples of disorder with the oxygen from the air we breathe.\r\n\r\n5. But there is a great class of _moral_ causes of diseases, acting on\r\nthe body through the medium of the mind—a class so extensive that PLATO\r\nconsidered it to be the origin of all corporeal maladies!\r\n\r\n6. Against these moral agents the great spas possess powerful auxiliary\r\ncounter-agents, _as preventives_, in the form of amusements on the spot\r\nand abstraction from cares. They also present the means of removing (if\r\nremoveable) the effects which these moral causes have already inflicted\r\non the bodily frame.\r\n\r\n7. The far greater number of physical remedies act by altering and\r\nimproving disordered functions and secretions—by evacuation—and by\r\nimparting tone to debilitated organs or the whole constitution.\r\n\r\n8. It must be allowed that mineral waters contain, to a very considerable\r\nextent, the requisite ingredients for fulfilling one or all of the\r\nforegoing indications.\r\n\r\n9. It is often found to be beneficial to combine tonics, alteratives,\r\nand aperients in the same formula or prescription, in order that the\r\nthree indications alluded to, may be simultaneously accomplished.[77]\r\nIt is undeniable that some of the spas contain within themselves this\r\ncombination of chalybeates, aperients, and alteratives, either of which\r\ningredients can be increased at pleasure on the spot.\r\n\r\n10. The medicinal agents in the mineral waters, though in much smaller\r\nquantities than when given in prescriptions, have a much better chance of\r\nsuccess, in consequence of their being so largely diluted by the hand of\r\nNature, and the temperature of the diluent being so very high, in most of\r\nthe springs.\r\n\r\n11. The early hours, and the exercise taken while drinking mineral\r\nwaters, have powerful influence in promoting their salutary operation.\r\nHow many invalids, in England, would start from their beds at five\r\no’clock in the morning, to drink salt and water till seven or eight\r\no’clock, using their limbs all the time in locomotion? very few!\r\n\r\n12. The warm bathing, which generally precedes or accompanies the\r\ndrinking of the waters, has also great effect in augmenting the medicinal\r\nagency of the waters taken internally. The circulation is drawn to the\r\nsurface—the insensible perspiration augmented—and various internal organs\r\nsympathise with the skin and are relieved from habitual congestion.\r\n\r\n13. The habit of early rising, which is unavoidable at the great spas,\r\nleads to many other good habits. Early meals and early bed-going follow\r\nof course, and of consequence. The excursions in the middle of the day,\r\nundertaken while devoid of care, and free from business, contribute not a\r\nlittle to the efficacy of the spas, and to soundness of repose at night.\r\n\r\n14. When I observed that many of the German spas combined tonic, with\r\naperient, and alterative qualities, I by no means averred that these\r\nqualities were always well proportioned for all complaints and various\r\nconstitutions. On the contrary, they are often very deficient in one\r\nor other of these qualities—and it is by overlooking this defect, and\r\ntrusting solely to the remedial agency of the waters, that continental\r\nphysicians commit a grand mistake—especially in the treatment of British\r\npatients.\r\n\r\n15. The digestive organs of our continental neighbours are habitually in\r\na far more tender and excitable condition than those of our countrymen,\r\nin consequence of their greasy and sloppy food, and the poverty and\r\nacidity of their wines and other drink. They cannot, therefore, bear\r\nmedicines of any strength, without great suffering. Relying on identity\r\nof constitution, the mineral waters are often administered ineffectually\r\nby foreign physicians to the people of these islands. These last are\r\nwashed and drenched, from day to day, and from week to week, while the\r\nglandular organs (the liver in particular) not directly affected by the\r\nwaters, become torpid in function, and vitiated in their secretions.\r\nHence it is that, after a week or a fortnight, much derangement takes\r\nplace in the digestive organs—febrile irritation is set up—the nervous\r\nsystem is impaired—and then, when the patient declares that the\r\nwaters are disagreeing with him, the SPA DOCTOR consoles him with the\r\ninformation that the spa-fever or crisis has come, and, if he lives\r\nthrough it, he will be much better than before it commenced! All this, in\r\nnine cases out of ten, might be prevented by taking a small dose of blue\r\npill—a couple of grains, for instance—over night. In this case, a much\r\nsmaller quantity of the waters would be sufficient in the morning, and\r\nthe liver and other glands would be roused to simultaneous action with\r\nthe bowels. The physicians of Cheltenham and Leamington act on this plan,\r\nand render the course of waters far more beneficial than they otherwise\r\nwould be. The crisis or spa-fever appears to me an act of salutary\r\nrebellion, on the part of Nature, against the injudicious employment of\r\nthe waters, and an effort to restore the equilibrium of function among\r\nthe great organs, which equilibrium has been disturbed by the waters\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n16. It is a well-known fact that soldiers, sailors, and even civilians,\r\nwill recover from illness much sooner in a public hospital than in their\r\nown homes—although attended by the same physician or surgeon. The same\r\napplies to infirmities of mind as well as of body. The individual who\r\nbecomes insane, has infinitely less chance of recovery at home amongst\r\nhis friends, than among strangers in an asylum. A great valetudinarium,\r\nlike the spas, comes under the same rule. How is this to be accounted\r\nfor? I have heard the aphorism of Rochefaucault quoted in explanation,\r\nviz. “that we derive pleasure from the sight of misery and suffering in\r\nothers, even when they are our dearest friends.” From long acquaintance\r\nwith human nature, I venture to say that, in this celebrated aphorism—or\r\nrather sophism—the author of it only stated _half_ a fact, and drew from\r\nthat half fact a _false_ inference. The emotion which we involuntarily\r\nexperience at the sight or the intelligence of misfortune or affliction\r\nin others, whether strangers or friends, is not unmixed—but a compound of\r\n_commiseration_ for the afflicted, and a feeling of _secret satisfaction_\r\n(magnified by Rochefaucault into _pleasure_) at our own immunity from\r\nthe evil. Two sailors are on the lee yard-arm furling the mainsail in\r\na tempest. The ship lurches—the yard-arm is swept by a wave—and one\r\nof the sailors is torn from his hold, and plunged into the deep. Will\r\nthe French philosopher persuade us that the seaman, who clings to the\r\nyard and escapes death, feels _pleasure_, unmixed with sorrow, at the\r\nsight of his drowning mess-mate? The poet, who saw and described a\r\ncatastrophe identical with the above, but on a larger scale, was far from\r\nentertaining the sentiment of the philosopher.\r\n\r\n    “Bereft of power to help, their comrades see\r\n    Their late companions die beneath their lee,\r\n    With fruitless _sorrow_ their lost state _bemoan_.”\r\n\r\n17. But there are other and adequate causes assignable for the more\r\nrapid recovery of health in public places of resort for invalids, than\r\nin private life. Man is the creature of habit; and habit results chiefly\r\nfrom imitation. In a great watering-place, we acquire, or at least comply\r\nwith, habits which we would not attempt at home. How many delicate and\r\nfashionable invalids would start from their couches at sun-rise every\r\nmorning, in London, and drink repeated draughts of nauseous compounds\r\nbefore breakfast? How many would dine at one, instead of seven o’clock?\r\nHow many would retire to bed at nine o’clock, instead of midnight or\r\nlater? How many gourmands and Bacchanalians, in England, would comply\r\nwith the rigid rules of abstemiousness enjoined by the spa doctors, and\r\nwhich they dare not infringe, lest the disobedience might render the\r\nwaters useless, or even injurious?\r\n\r\nThe revolution in social, but insalutary habits alone, would cure half\r\nthe _disorders_ for which the aristocratic valetudinarian flies to the\r\nspas. If the maxim of Rochefaucault, too, have any foundation in truth,\r\nwhat a prodigious source of pleasure must the spa-goer find in the\r\ndifferent watering-places, where he daily contemplates almost the whole\r\nof the moving mass of mortals around him labouring under more or less of\r\nbodily suffering! But, admitting the less humiliating explanation which\r\nI have attempted of the philosophical maxim, the result will not be\r\nmaterially different. Every one affected by _disorders_ at all curable,\r\nwill see many around him who are evidently afflicted by _diseases_ beyond\r\nthe reach of remedy. While commiserating the fate of their neighbours,\r\nthey have a pleasing consciousness and assurance that they themselves\r\nare not in such a hopeless condition. As for the victims doomed to an\r\nearly grave, _they_ never despair. They see daily recoveries going on\r\naround them—and HOPE, “that comes to all,” does not withhold its balmy\r\ninfluence even from them! The resounding Sprudel is pouring forth its\r\nhealing waters for the incurable as well as for the curable, whilst the\r\nveil of mystery that hangs over its origin and source, exaggerates, on\r\nthe well-known principle, “_omne ignotum pro magnifico_,” the virtues of\r\nits miraculous qualities! The season of the year in which the journey is\r\nmade and the waters taken, is not a little favourable to the recovery of\r\nhealth, and, combined with the sanguine expectations of recruited vigour\r\nand emancipation from sufferings, gives wonderful efficacy to the spa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTEIN, commonly called WILDBAD GASTEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nGastein, Pfeffers, and Teplitz are triplet sisters of the same qualities,\r\nphysical and medicinal. They are so pure that they may be, and are used\r\nas spring water for drinking and culinary purposes. The locality of\r\nGastein is only inferior in romantic scenery to that of Pfeffers. It is\r\nmuch superior to that of Wildbad. It is situated on the frontiers of the\r\nDuchy of Salzburg and Carinthia, in the midst of mountains ten thousand\r\nfeet in height, and its fervid springs, several in number, rise on the\r\nborders, and in the very middle of a cataract that foams and flies over a\r\nprecipice, with a noise like thunder, into an abyss of nearly 300 feet in\r\ndepth. It is the little river ACHE that descends from the mountains, and\r\nforms the striking feature of the landscape at Gastein, which was once a\r\nplace of wealth and consequence, by reason of the neighbouring mines; but\r\nis now only a valetudinarium for the recovery of health. The people of\r\nthis neighbourhood are of remarkably robust and vigorous constitutions,\r\nwell made, and handsome in appearance—pastoral in their habits, and\r\nsimple in their manners.\r\n\r\nThere are six available springs, besides those which rise in the bed\r\nof the torrent. The highest is the Prince’s Well, near the Chateau,\r\nand which is a very abundant source—furnishing 13,680 cubic feet of\r\nwater in the 24 hours—the temperature being always 37° of Reamur, or\r\n115° Fahrenheit. It is used conjointly with the water of an adjoining\r\nspring, called the “DOCTOR’S WELL,” which is one or two degrees higher\r\nin temperature. This last furnishes 3,600 cubic feet of water in the\r\n24 hours. These two sources supply, by means of a pump, the new baths\r\nnear the Chateau. Another is named after the Emperor Francis—and another\r\nstill, that of the Hospital, at the foot of the Richeuibein, throwing up\r\nthe astonishing quantity of 72,720 cubic feet of hot water in the day and\r\nnight! All these springs are on the right bank of the ACHE; but there are\r\nother sources on the left bank also—the aggregate of all being upwards of\r\none hundred thousand cubic feet of mineral water in the 24 hours.\r\n\r\nThere are ten or a dozen establishments for bathing at Gastein—some of\r\nthem not the most splendid or convenient in the world. The practice of\r\nbathing in common is not very unusual here, and consequently upwards of\r\n150 people may bathe at the same time. The complaint of Dr. Granville,\r\nthat the baths are seldom completely emptied during the day, is not\r\nwithout foundation in truth. Gastein is now probably the only place where\r\nmen and women bathe together.\r\n\r\n“The common bath (says Dr. Streinz) in which gentlemen and ladies\r\nassemble together, contains 365 cubic feet of water, and requires\r\nnearly four hours to fill it. It will accommodate fifteen or sixteen\r\npersons, who can walk about in the water, or rest upon seats which are\r\nfixed there for the purpose. At each side of the bath there is a large\r\ndressing-room, one for the men, the other for the women. Around the bath\r\nruns a gallery, where the friends or acquaintances of the bathers can\r\nassemble, and enter into conversation with them.”[78]\r\n\r\nIt is quite useless to go into minute topographical details. Those who\r\nrepair to Gastein will not need them—and those who stay at home will not\r\nread them. We shall therefore proceed to the properties of the waters\r\nthemselves. It has been already observed that they are purer than any\r\nspring water, and so clear that you can discern particles of gravel\r\nat a depth of some feet. They spring from the earth without noise or\r\nbubbling. In certain damp states of the atmosphere, and preceding rains,\r\nsome people have perceived a slight odour of sulphuretted hydrogen gas\r\nin these springs; but it is so questionable that they may be used as\r\ncommon beverage. They suffer no change, when exposed to the air, nor\r\ndeposit any matter. Their temperature has been stated. When polished\r\nsilver is immersed for four or five hours in these springs it becomes\r\ntinged of a brownish yellow colour, not easily effaced. The water leaves\r\nincrustations on wood or other articles exposed to its action, which\r\nincrustations are soft, astringent, and bitter to the taste. These waters\r\nhave a remarkably vivifying effect on flowers, fruits, and vegetables\r\nexposed to their influence. In a pint of the water there is about 2⅔\r\ngrs. of solid matters, chiefly sulphate and muriate of soda, with a\r\nminute trace of iron. When brought near the magnetic needle it draws the\r\nloadstone sensibly towards it, which quality diminishes as the water\r\ncools. It has been ascertained that the Gastein water is composed of\r\nthree, instead of two atoms of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen.\r\n\r\nThese waters are used as common baths—vapour-baths—and taken internally.\r\nThe douches are also much employed. Their remedial powers, seeing that\r\nthey have no chemical properties worth notice, have called forth much\r\nspeculation—the conclusion, however, being, that the cause of this\r\nmedicinal agency is veiled from human ken. This being the case, our\r\nobject is to investigate the actual effects of waters so pure on the\r\nhuman frame. This, which is mere matter of observation, is far from\r\nbeing an easy matter. Spa doctors become unintentionally prejudiced—and\r\nspa tourists are often credulous—while patients themselves are often\r\ndeceived—attributing virtues to the waters which sprang from various\r\nother causes that received no credit at the time. It is affirmed by Dr.\r\nStreinz and others, that the waters of Gastein, whether used internally,\r\nor externally, or both, produce a certain degree of excitation in the\r\nhuman constitution, evinced by some increase of temperature in the\r\nbody—of power in the muscles—of animation in the eye and countenance—of\r\nclearness in the complexion—of acceleration in the circulation—of\r\nactivity in the nervous system—of exhilaration of spirits. Those who\r\nbathe in them experience (as they say) unusual pleasurable sensations.\r\nThe surface of the body becomes soft and smooth, with a slight but\r\npleasant pricking, and sometimes a minute vesicular eruption. Dr.\r\nGranville’s description of the effects of the Gastein baths, however, is\r\ndirectly the reverse of Dr. Streinz, who observed them so long in others,\r\nand experienced them in his own person.\r\n\r\n“The effect (says Dr. G.) produced by the water on the skin of the hands\r\nduring the first ten minutes of immersion in it was curious. The bath\r\ncorrugated and crisped it as if the hands had been held in very hot\r\nwater for a considerable time; and on passing my hand all over the body,\r\npreviously to the skin of the fingers becoming crisp—in fact almost\r\nimmediately after going into the bath—instead of gliding smoothly and\r\noilily down it, as at Wildbad, it felt ruvid, and the two surfaces seemed\r\nto meet with resistance, as if a third body, slightly rough, like the\r\nfinest sand, lay between them.”\r\n\r\nHere then we have two physicians giving diametrically opposite accounts\r\nof the physical phenomena produced by the same waters—shewing how little\r\ndependence can be placed on individual descriptions—the said phenomena\r\nvarying according to the temperament, state of health, or even temper of\r\nmind of the personal observer!\r\n\r\nIt is stated by the German physicians that, after the third or fourth\r\nbath, some indisposition is usually felt—some giddiness about the head,\r\nand a relaxation, or sense of weakness in the limbs. These symptoms\r\ndisappear in a day or two by repose and abstinence. The use of these\r\nwaters renders people more susceptible of atmospheric impressions, of\r\nthe electric kind, especially before or during a storm, accompanied by a\r\nsense of prostration or exhaustion, and heaviness about the head, with\r\ndepression of spirits. The internal exhibition of these waters promotes\r\nthe action of the bowels, and still more of the kidneys, attended\r\nby increase of appetite. The deposits of this water are extolled as\r\napplications to old wounds and inveterate ulcers.\r\n\r\n“Long and multiplied experience (says Dr. Streinz) has proved that\r\nthe bathe of Gastein re-animate the vital powers that were almost\r\nextinct—comfort and give tone to the flabby limbs—communicate new\r\nand vivifying heat to the blood—vigor to the nerves—and, through\r\nthe medium of the magnetico-galvanic principle, re-establish the\r\nactivity of the whole animal organism. Those who labour under direct\r\ndebility, are those who have experienced most benefit from these\r\nwaters—as those who have lost their strength from excessive efforts\r\nof the mind, large discharges of blood, or too copious and violent\r\nevacuations of any kind—those who have never perfectly recovered from\r\nsevere acute diseases—who labour under disorders of the digestive\r\norgans—tremors—hypochondriasis—hysteria—neuralgic pains—inveterate\r\ngout and rheumatism—paralysis—contractions—affections of the\r\nspine—scrofula—mercurial diseases, &c. Their exciting qualities, however,\r\nrender it necessary that both patient and physician should watch their\r\nphysiological action on the body, and observe a very mild and abstemious\r\nregimen.”\r\n\r\nDr. Granville appears to be quite as confident in the efficacy of the\r\nGastein waters as Dr. Streinz, Dr. Storch, or any of the most sanguine of\r\nhis German brethren.\r\n\r\n“I have no more doubt of the power which this mineral spring possesses,\r\nin the diseases for which it has been recommended, than I have of the\r\neffect of bleeding in subduing inflammation.”\r\n\r\nMy friend’s “grain of faith” is not like that of a mustard-seed—it is as\r\nlarge as a cocoa-nut! At all events, I cannot swallow it; and entertain\r\nvery strong doubts indeed of the efficacy of Gastein water in such a\r\nmultiplicity of serious diseases as are comprehended in Dr. Granville’s\r\nor Dr. Streinz’s catalogue. I can easily conceive that these waters,\r\nassisted by the mountain air, the romantic scenery, and the journey to\r\nthe place, may produce all the effects which can be expected from such\r\nwaters as Pfeffers, Wildbad, and Schlangenbad; but that they can work\r\nlike magic I entirely disbelieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether we view this ancient capital of Bohemia from the bridge below, or\r\nthe monastery above, we must acknowledge that, next to Constantinople,\r\nPrague is the most picturesque city in Europe. It is, however, from\r\nthe central arch of the longest bridge in Germany, and certainly the\r\nmost _sainted_ one, that we have the finest view of a vast amphitheatre\r\nrising tier above tier, from the broad stream of the Moldau, till the\r\nhighest ridges of the precipices seem groaning under the massive piles\r\nof buildings that crown their brows. The huge structure, called the\r\nHRADSCHIN, the palace of the Bohemian kings—frowns over endless domes,\r\nspires, turrets, minarets, churches, convents, and cathedrals. The eye\r\ncomes down at length to a bridge more holy, though not more handsome,\r\nthan the Santa Trinita over the Arno. There are nearly as many saints\r\nstanding on the parapets here as there are sinners traversing the body\r\nof the bridge! The master saint (St. John Nepomuck) was a priest, who,\r\nrefusing to disclose the secrets of the confessional, was pitched into\r\nthe Moldau by King Winceslaus for his contempt of court. But murder will\r\nnot sleep; and a flickering flame hovered over the spot where the priest\r\nlay in his watery shroud, till he was discovered, and his body encased\r\nin a gorgeous silver shrine, which may be still seen in the cathedral\r\n(enclosed within the Hradschin) and is, perhaps, the most costly tomb\r\nin the world. The silver alone weighs thirty-seven hundred weight! The\r\nbody of the sainted priest lies in a crystal coffin of great value! The\r\nlions of Prague would require a volume for description, and as Murray\r\nhas dedicated twenty-seven columns to short notices of the chief objects\r\nof curiosity, I shall not say a word on this head. Three or four days, or\r\na week, may be well occupied here, and the environs are very pretty. But\r\nit is worthy of notice that, in this beautiful and picturesque capital of\r\nBohemia, the average duration of life, is one-third less than in London!\r\nThe annual mortality in Prague, is one in twenty-two. In London it is not\r\nmore than one in thirty-two. The Jews, who are here, as at Rome, crowded\r\ninto a low and dirty quarter on the banks of the river, are longer lived\r\nthan their tyrannical Christian oppressors. They are also more prolific.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days very pleasantly at Prague; but when preparing to\r\nstart for Teplitz, I was horrified at finding that I had lost the receipt\r\nfor my passport—and that too, in Austria! The Commissionaire at the “DREI\r\nLINDEN,” seemed even more terrified than myself, and thinking he would\r\ncontrive to make a job of the business, I marched off to the Bureau, and\r\ncandidly stated the loss I had sustained. The officer, having cast a\r\nscrutinizing glance at me, took down a huge pile of passports, and soon\r\nsingled mine out. “Voila, Monsieur, votre passport,” was all he said,\r\nand he never made the least difficulty, or seemed to consider it the\r\nslightest favour, to deliver me the precious document, without producing\r\na receipt! I say again, and again, the Austrian police is grossly\r\nslandered. They are the most civil and polite on the Continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEPLITZ.[79]\r\n\r\n\r\nA long journey of sixty odd miles from Prague, through a country varied,\r\nand often interesting, brings us to the fertile valley of Teplitz studded\r\nwith chateaux and villas, and well cultivated. The hills and mountains,\r\nfor many miles before we reach Teplitz, are all conical and volcanic.\r\nThis is the great WASH-TUB of Germany. What prodigious masses of exuviæ,\r\nsuds, and sordes, must annually float down the Elbe to fertilize its\r\nshores! Three great public baths (and now a fourth, at Schoneau) for\r\nmen, women, and children, respectively, display an immense number of\r\nhuman beings—all Adams and Eves without fig-leaves—immersed in water\r\nat a temperature sometimes of 114° of Fahrenheit, inhaling a dense\r\nsteam, through which you could formerly have scarcely distinguished\r\nthem—panting, perspiring, and streaming blood from scarifications on\r\ntheir backs to prevent their brains from being torn up by the excited\r\ncirculation! Such _was_ a picture from which DANTE might have drawn some\r\nof his scenes in the inferno—except that here, it was not the “PURGATORY”\r\nof guilty souls, but the “expurgatorium,” of unclean bodies.[80]\r\n\r\nThe natural temperature of these waters is from 120° to 84°—and the\r\nchief ingredient is carbonate of soda—about two or three grains in the\r\npint.[81] The private baths are upwards of eighty in number, in the\r\ntown, besides the long range of most elegant new baths in the village\r\nof Schonau—decidedly the most superb bathing-places in Europe, and\r\nare in full request from morn till dewy eve. The water is limpid, and\r\nsoon after immersion in a blood-heat temperature, or even lower, the\r\nsurface of the body (according to Dr. Granville) becomes rough, rigid,\r\nand even wrinkled—a condition that obtains for some time after leaving\r\nthe bath.[82] Perspiration also is visible on the skin, in big round\r\ndrops, while the individual is proceeding to dry and dress. At a higher\r\ntemperature than that of the blood—say from 108° to 112° or 114°, the\r\naction of the bath on the circulation and excitability is emphatic, and\r\nmust often be extremely dangerous. The excitation first induced, is, and\r\nmust be followed by a corresponding degree of depression or exhaustion.\r\nThe reputation of the Teplitz baths is probably as much founded on the\r\nhigh temperature at which they are used, as on the composition of the\r\nwaters themselves. There ought to be a mart at Teplitz for the sale of\r\ncast-off or second-hand crutches! “I may state (says Dr. Granville) that\r\nthe specific virtue of these baths lies in the power they possess of\r\nrestoring a cripple—it matters little from what cause—to perfect motion\r\nand elasticity.” Among the list of maladies that may be perfectly cured\r\nhere, we have—“all cases of suppressed gout, chronic rheumatism, diseases\r\nof the articulations, paralytic affections, contracted limbs, old\r\nwounds, night pains in the bones, and many other diseases.”—_Granville._\r\nAgain, Dr. G. avers that—“with proper management I should not despair of\r\nrecovering _from all his ailments_, the most pitiable object of gouty\r\ntyranny.” These are strong assurances. But I would strenuously caution\r\nthe victim of suppressed gout respecting the baths of Teplitz, where the\r\ntemperature is much higher, though the ingredients are not much stronger\r\nthan in the waters of Wildbad or Pfeffers.\r\n\r\nA physician, though young in years, yet of good promise, at Teplitz,\r\n(Dr. Richter) has written an interesting little work on these waters, and\r\nas it is in French, I would recommend it to the perusal of those who go\r\nto Teplitz for the purpose of bathing. During my stay at this celebrated\r\nspa, I had the advantage of Dr. Richter’s company and experience through\r\nthe whole of the bathing establishments, and, through his influence,\r\nwas permitted (being only a doctor) to visit the public baths—even\r\nthose in which the women were bathing, with the greatest facility. It\r\nwas at Schonau that I first saw the female bath in full operation.\r\nThere might be about twenty women in the basin, when Dr. R. and myself\r\nentered. There was a slight commotion among the bathers on my first\r\nappearance, which quickly subsided, when my profession was announced and\r\nmy privilege explained. Dr. R. published his work in 1840, and it is the\r\nmost authentic guide and authority on the subject. I shall here give a\r\ncondensed analysis of the small volume.\r\n\r\nThe various sources of the waters here differ but little in their\r\nchemical, physical, or even thermal properties. The water is limpid, and\r\ndoes not become turbid by standing, nor does it disengage bubbles of gas\r\nor air, with the exception of the Gartenquelle. The temperature varies\r\nfrom 120° Fahrenheit (the Hauptquelle), to 80° (the Gartenquelle). The\r\ntunnels and reservoirs over which the waters pass become coated with\r\na brownish-yellow substance, composed chiefly of silex and acidulated\r\noxide of iron. There are other depositions and incrustations into which\r\nthe carbonates of lime and magnesia, as well as manganese and strontia,\r\nenter. In the wells of Steinbad, Stadtbad, and Gartenquelle, there have\r\nbeen observed various _thermal oscillatoria_. These waters do not present\r\nthe same slowness in boiling and cooling that some other hot spas have\r\nevinced.\r\n\r\nThe great disproportion between the physiological action and the\r\nchemical composition of the Teplitz waters, has given rise to numerous\r\nspeculations, and support the grand argument that there is an occult\r\nquality in mineral waters which defies our minutest chemistry. One thing\r\nis obvious, that these waters are alkaline, saline, and chalybeate—and\r\nconsequently that they possess, at one and the same time, solvent and\r\ntonic qualities, which are greatly augmented by their temperature. Dr.\r\nR. very properly investigates their physical and physiological action,\r\naccording as they are applied hot, warm, tepid, or cold to the body. They\r\nmay be termed hot, when above 100°—very hot when approaching to 120°—warm\r\nat blood-heat (98°)—tepid, when under 90°—and cold at the temperature of\r\nthe earth or air.\r\n\r\nThe very hot bath (110° to 115°) produces quickly a general excitation\r\nof the circulation and sensibility, like all other hot waters. It\r\naugments the secretions, ending in considerable perspiration—and followed\r\nultimately by relaxation in the muscular and fibrous systems, and a\r\ngeneral softening of all the solid parts. When the bath is very warm, we\r\nhave often, in addition to the foregoing phenomena, oppression at the\r\nchest—anxiety—palpitation—vertigo—dimness of sight—heaviness about the\r\nhead—syncope—and even apoplexy. It need hardly be added, that baths at\r\nsuch a temperature as to induce the foregoing train of symptoms, are very\r\ndangerous, and hardly ever necessary.\r\n\r\nBut even at a moderate temperature—96° or 98°—these baths produce,\r\nafter a few days, sleeplessness, constipation, great disposition to\r\nperspiration, emaciation, susceptibility to cold or damp, aggravation\r\nof gouty or rheumatic pains, the aching of old wounds, prostration of\r\nstrength, &c. These occur about the eighth day, and, after more or less\r\nduration, gradually disappear. After this period, there generally appears\r\nan eruption on the skin, of a whitish yellow or red colour, accompanied\r\nby considerable itching, discharging a watery humour, and finally\r\ndesquamating, with occasionally some fever.\r\n\r\nIf the baths be continued longer, the prostration and lassitude\r\nincrease, accompanied by great irritability and moroseness, loss of\r\nappetite, furred tongue, nausea, fætid eructations, repugnance to the\r\nbath, wandering pains in the limbs—in fine, fever is kindled up, with\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane of the stomach and bowels. This is\r\nwhat the Germans call “DAS UEBERBADEN,” or over-bathing—and occurs after\r\neighteen or twenty baths—sometimes not till after forty or sixty.\r\n\r\nDr. Richter conceives that, in all cases where it is deemed proper to\r\nstimulate the circulation and the lymphatics—to rouse the energy of\r\nthe nervous system when paralyzed—to excite strongly the functions of\r\nthe skin—to depurate bad humours—to expel a morbid principle from the\r\nconstitution or the internal organs—to relax contracted tendons or\r\nmuscles—to reduce abnormal or morbid growths—it will be necessary to\r\nhave recourse to the HOT baths of Teplitz, watching their effects, and\r\nmoderating their action from time to time, according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe _warm_ baths (95° to 100°) re-animate the human organism—cause a\r\nsense of comfort (bien-être)—gently excite the circulation—equalize the\r\nexcitability of the nervous system—and impart elasticity to the muscles.\r\nThey do not cause perspiration: but rather absorption of fluids, internal\r\nas well as external—resolve enlargements of glands or other parts—correct\r\nacidity—prove diuretic—and excite the healthy action of the uterine\r\nsystem. The symptoms of “OVER-BATHING,” described under the head of hot\r\nbaths, less frequently occur, with the warm bath—are more moderate in\r\ndegree, when they do occur—and are longer in making their appearance. It\r\nis needless to observe that these are much safer than the hot baths.\r\n\r\nThe tepid baths of Teplitz (84° to 94°) diminish nervous\r\nirritability—dispose to sleep—render the respiration slower—soften and\r\nabate the action of the heart and arteries—diminish the size of external\r\nparts—increase the action of the kidneys and internal glands—promote\r\nabsorption. With this temperature of the waters, the symptoms of\r\n“over-bathing” seldom appear. It may be remarked, that they have here,\r\nas at Wildbad, baths where the waters rise through the sand at the bottom\r\nof the basin. As the spring is constantly rising and running away, the\r\ntemperature cannot be regulated, and those springs are selected for\r\nthe sand-baths, where the temperature is about blood-heat. The same\r\nadvantages are attached to the sand-baths here, as at Wildbad—namely,\r\nthat the waters are always running in and out of the bath, which is kept\r\nat the same degree of heat always. The same advantage attaches to the\r\nstone-baths at Pfeffers, and the latter are, I think, more cleanly—at\r\nleast to the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe internal use of the Teplitz waters is considered favourable to the\r\nphysiological or remedial action of the baths. They have some aperient\r\nproperties—promote mucous and other secretions—but their chief action is\r\non the absorbents, and therefore they are most used in those cases where\r\nthere are tumours to be dispersed, or abnormal growths to be removed.\r\nThere can be little danger in drinking such pure waters as those of\r\nTeplitz.\r\n\r\nThe special or particular maladies for which the waters and baths\r\nof this place have long been renowned, were already stated in the\r\nextract from Dr. Granville. Dr. Richter has dedicated a chapter to\r\nthe _modus operandi_ of the Teplitz baths on gout, both local and in\r\nits complications with affections of the digestive organs, lungs,\r\nheart, &c.—on chronic rheumatism, in its various seats, and with\r\nits painful consequences, as swellings of the joints, ankylosis,\r\nmuscular contractions, loss of power, &c.—_paralysis_, numbers of\r\npatients affected with which, come annually to Teplitz, to throw\r\naway their crutches, and—“retourner gaiement dans leurs foyers.”\r\nThe noise, however, of a brilliant cure too often brings to Teplitz\r\nparalytic sufferers, with organic diseases of the brain or spine, and\r\ntherefore beyond the reach of all remedy. Rickets, disease of the\r\nhip-joint, and spinal distortion, are said to be eminently relieved,\r\nand often cured by the Teplitz waters. The same may be said of various\r\ncutaneous diseases, especially in their chronic forms—suppression\r\nof the natural or habitual evacuations—ulcers—disposition to gravel\r\nand stone—old and painful wounds, healed or open—diseases resulting\r\nfrom metallic fumes—swellings and engorgements of the liver, spleen,\r\nand other abdominal organs—hæmorrhoids—nervous asthma—chronic\r\nsickness—colics—hysteria—hypochondriasis—derangements peculiar to\r\nfemales—sterility—in short, three fourths of human affections, in their\r\nchronic or tedious conditions!\r\n\r\nThe counter-indications are here much the same as at the other thermal\r\nsprings—namely, states of plethora, local or general—and all dispositions\r\nto inflammatory or feverish affections. The cautions and precautions need\r\nnot be repeated in this place.\r\n\r\nMud-baths have been established at Teplitz since 1835—one establishment\r\nis at the Stadtbad—the other at the Schlangenbad. The peat-bog it found\r\nto the north of the town, and contains, according to the analysis of\r\nMessrs. Wolf and Pleische, the sulphates, muriates, carbonates, and\r\nhumates of soda—lime—magnesia—iron—and much ulmine and other organic\r\nremains. They are prepared in the same manner as at Franzensbad and other\r\nplaces, and are much used in cutaneous complaints—rheumatism and gout of\r\nobstinate character—deformities and nodosities, the sequences of these\r\nmaladies—neuralgic and paralytic affections—metallic diseases—tumours and\r\nindurations of glandular structures, as of the liver, spleen, mesentery,\r\novaries, &c. They are wisely forbidden in organic diseases of the heart\r\nand other vital viscera, in high grades of nervous irritability, and in\r\nall predispositions to hæmorrhages, on account of their high powers of\r\nstimulation. An English lady of rank was using them here, and spoke in\r\nhigh terms of their salutary effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nThe town of Teplitz is not very interesting. The street that leads\r\nfrom the MARKET-PLACE to the PLACE DU CHATEAUX, is chiefly composed of\r\nhotels—none of them of first-rate character. From the Prince de Clairy’s\r\npalace (which looks like a cotton-factory in Manchester) we turn down\r\nan abrupt little street to the great bathing-places—including the\r\nHerrenhaus, and the gardens behind, where the waters are drunk by a very\r\nfew persons. The gardens behind the Prince de Clairy’s residence are\r\numbrageous and pleasant; but the masses of stagnant, or almost stagnant,\r\ngreen water, amongst them, are neither agreeable to the eye nor healthy\r\nto the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood of Teplitz is very beautiful and picturesque. A walk\r\nof fifteen minutes up a steep ascent from the Herrenhaus takes us to the\r\nSPITALBERG, from the summit of which, where there is an imitation of a\r\nruin, a fine view may be taken of Teplitz and the surrounding country\r\nfor twenty miles in every direction. A still finer and more extensive\r\nview is had from the SCHLOSSBERG, two miles distant from Teplitz, and\r\nmounted without much difficulty. The mountain is crowned with the old\r\nruin of a strong castle, from which a magnificent panorama is seen. To\r\nthe South-East we contemplate Boreslau, and the numerous conical heads of\r\nthe Mittlegebirge mountains, as far as Aussig, where the silver Elbe is\r\nseen flowing along.—To the North-East is the long line of the Erzgeberg\r\n(Metalliferous) mountains, the frontiers of Saxony—while directly North,\r\nthe battle-field of Culm, with its three brazen monuments, lies stretched\r\nbefore us, with all its historical associations and recollections of the\r\nbrave but bloody deeds which were there enacted, even in our own days!\r\n\r\nThe history of the Schlossberg is veiled in obscurity. It was a rebel’s\r\nor perhaps a robber’s citadel, some eight hundred years ago; but has\r\nbeen a mass of ruins since the time of the Hussites. It was partially\r\nrebuilt, in the fifteenth century, by John de Wresowec, and its praises\r\nwere chanted by the poet MITIS.\r\n\r\n            ——Cujusdam refulgent\r\n    Mænia vixque non attingentia nubes,\r\n    Quæ WRESOWICHIA jecit de stirpe Joannes.\r\n\r\nThe walls which then “all but reached the clouds,” have now, all but\r\ncrumbled into dust, like Wresowec and all his ancestors and descendants!\r\nIt was from this ruin that the Emperor of Russia, the Emperor of Austria\r\nand King of Prussia surveyed, with no small anxiety—perhaps fear—the\r\ngreat events that passed underneath them on the field of Culm.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, Teplitz may be considered as the most fashionable\r\nbathing-place in all Germany—scarcely a season passing, without crowned\r\nheads and flocks of nobility coming here to rid themselves of bodily\r\ninfirmities or cares of the mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Translation of a Note received from Dr. Richter, of Teplitz, (by Mr.\r\nSpitta) dated 18th Sept. 1840._\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,—In my little work on the waters of this place, I find I\r\nhave entirely omitted to mention the subject of PARALYSIS, occasioned\r\nby mechanical injuries, and especially those which sometimes follow\r\ndifficult accouchements. On this topic, Dr. Siebold, one of the most\r\neminent obstetrical practitioners in Germany, has published his opinions,\r\nand strongly recommends the baths of Teplitz, as more efficacious than\r\nany other remedy.\r\n\r\nI omitted also, in my “ENVIRONS OF TEPLITZ,” to allude to the mineral\r\nwaters of Püllna, Sedlitz, and Saidschitz, so celebrated all over Europe,\r\nand which are situated at four leagues from Teplitz, on the Carlsbad\r\nroad. The village of Püllna lies in a beautiful plain, two or three\r\nhundred yards from the Chaussee, on the right; and the mineral springs\r\nthemselves are close to the road. I refer you to Mr. Spitta for further\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nP.S.—A rail-road is forming between Dresden and Prague, to run by\r\nTeplitz. This will render the communication between London, Teplitz, and\r\nCarlsbad, extremely easy and quick.\r\n\r\nI am, dear Sir,\r\n\r\n                              Your’s truly,\r\n\r\n                                                THEODORE L. RICHTER, M.D.\r\n\r\n_Teplitz, 18th Sept. 1840._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Paper of Mr. Spitta’s on the Waters of Püllna, &c._\r\n\r\nWithin a morning’s drive from Teplitz, are situated three mineral\r\nsprings, little known, yet in many respects extremely interesting—Püllna,\r\nSaidschitz, and Sedlitz. They all yield a water of a similar nature, rich\r\nin the sulphates of magnesia and soda; and which is so peculiarly bitter,\r\nas to have acquired the title of “Bitterwasser.”\r\n\r\nHaving heard so much of this bitterwasser in Germany, and of the powders\r\nof Sedlitz at home, I was anxious to ascertain the true nature of the\r\nsprings; and see if they really afforded a mineral water so agreeable\r\nand salutary as we get in England by dissolving our “genuine _Sedlitz_\r\npowders.” I proposed an excursion, and Dr. Richter, of Teplitz, with his\r\nusual urbanity, kindly accompanied me.\r\n\r\nSo near as Teplitz is to these springs, it will doubtless appear strange\r\nto others as it did to me, that, no one, not even the people at the\r\npost-office, where we ordered the carriage, could tell us their exact\r\nposition. So great a traffic! so much Sedlitz salt prepared! one hardly\r\nknew how to account for such ignorance. Püllna, indeed, they had heard\r\nof; for, being on the road from Carlsbad to Teplitz, it could not well\r\nhave been overlooked; Saidschitz was conceived, by possibility, to exist;\r\nbut, as to poor Sedlitz, where all our powders come from, its very\r\nexistence was denied; nor was it, till we were within a mile, that we\r\nlearnt its situation from a few wandering peasants.\r\n\r\nI may mention a few of the general characters of these bitterwasser\r\nsprings before noticing each separately. Their method of formation is\r\npeculiar. Large circular holes are dug into a stratum of earth, which\r\ncontains the saline ingredients; in these the rain-water is allowed to\r\ncollect: it dissolves the salts, and yields the bitterwasser. It is\r\nreally very remarkable, that a stratum of soil should be found containing\r\nso large an amount of saline ingredient; and not the less singular, that\r\nit is of so limited an extent; thus, at Saidschitz, it has a diameter\r\nof about a quarter to half a mile; and a well dug beyond this area will\r\nyield no bittersalz. The soil is easily recognized by its yellow-white\r\ncolour, and by the fact that nothing grows upon it. The plautago indeed,\r\nand some species of hieracea (hawk’s weed) exist there; and I had the\r\ncuriosity to bring home a specimen of the former plant, because the man\r\nwho had been some years in charge of the wells at Saidschitz, knew the\r\ncharacter of the soil, and judged of the propriety of sinking another\r\nwell in any given spot, by its presence or absence.\r\n\r\nIn a geological point of view, these springs are not without interest.\r\nThey are, if I may be allowed so botanical a comparison, a completely\r\ndifferent genus of the great class “mineral spring.” It has been\r\nasserted, that mineral springs in general are formed by solution of\r\nthe salts in the neighbouring mountains, by the rain-water which\r\npasses through them. This opinion, for many reasons, has _seemed_ to\r\nme erroneous; but these springs furnish a _proof_ by analogy, of great\r\nweight. For here are springs really formed by such an artificial method;\r\nand what happens? The soil furnishes (which is not the case with the soil\r\nin the neighbourhood of any other springs) the same water by artificial\r\ndigestion. The late Dr. Struve succeeded in this manner in forming a\r\nvery capital Püllna. Again, these springs formed so artificially are\r\nuninfluenced, like others, by volcanic shocks, and earthquakes. The\r\nHauptquelle, at Teplitz, stopped for a moment, during the earthquake at\r\nLisbon, and then rushed forth with redoubled violence. Many other sources\r\nalso have been similarly affected. Indeed, from Lyall’s account, it\r\nseems to be no uncommon circumstance: and new ones have even risen into\r\nexistence, at such awful crises. On they go, however, the bitter springs,\r\nfrom year to year, totally regardless. They have no fixed temperature;\r\nbecause, as I presume, they are not in connexion with the centre of the\r\nearth. They have no fixed level of water, from the same cause. They vary,\r\non the contrary, like all other common springs at the surface, with the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere, and the quantity of water which percolates\r\nthe earth to supply them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAIDSCHITZ.\r\n\r\nThe first we visited was Saidschitz, about three hours drive from\r\nTeplitz: and I would advise none but those anxiously desirous of medical\r\nobservation, to venture there. The road is shocking; at one part I was\r\nwalking, whilst my friend Dr. Richter was reclining in the carriage.\r\nSuddenly a large rut appeared, and I feel convinced, that, had not the\r\ncoachman and myself propped up the side of the carriage, which was\r\nfalling towards us, it would, with all its professional contents, have\r\nbeen quietly precipitated.\r\n\r\nArrived at length, and eager to taste the water, of which so much had\r\nbeen said, I swallowed some of the most nauseous physic it is possible\r\nto prescribe. Instead of the nice saline draught which _our_ Sedlitz\r\npowder makes, of tartrate of soda and potash, rendered even effervescent\r\nby the succeeding additions of carbonated soda and tartaric acid, the\r\nbitterwasser of Saidschitz consists of a strong solution of Epsom and\r\nGlauber’s salts; and I need not say that the term “bitterwasser” is most\r\nappropriately applied. There are twenty-two wells at Saidschitz, all\r\ncapable of furnishing a large quantity of water, though few only are in\r\nactual use. They are included, as I previously said, within an area of\r\nabout a quarter of a mile; and each well is covered with a small wooden\r\nshed, like a hay-cock. When drawn, the water is quite clear, and without\r\nany bubbles of carbonic acid. It has no smell, but a slightly brown\r\ncolor, depending on the presence of a peculiar acid, termed by Berzelius\r\nthe “_chrenic_” (χρηνη, source). It undergoes no alteration by standing.\r\n\r\nMost of these properties would have been anticipated from an inspection\r\nof the following analysis[83] published by Professor Berzelius.\r\n\r\nSixteen ounces contain,\r\n\r\n  Sulphate of soda                               46.8019\r\n  Sulphate of potash                              4.0965\r\n  Sulphate of magnesia                           84.1666\r\n  Sulphate of lime                               10.0776\r\n  Chloride of magnesium                           2.1696\r\n  Iodide of magnesium                              .0368\r\n  Nitrate of magnesia                            25.1715\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia                           3.9858\r\n  Chrenate of magnesia                            1.0667\r\n  Oxyde of iron and manganese                      .0192\r\n  Oxyde of tin with traces of oxyde of copper      .0307\r\n  Silica                                           .0360\r\n  Bromine and fluorine                            traces\r\n  Ammonia                                         traces\r\n                                                --------\r\n                                                177.6589\r\n                                                --------\r\n\r\nThe water is not allowed to be bottled at Saidschitz, but is sent to\r\nBilin, a little town about two hours drive from Teplitz, for that purpose.\r\n\r\nSaidschitz salt however is prepared there in considerable quantities.\r\nThe water is evaporated to a proper degree of concentration, when the\r\nthree sulphates of soda, potash, and magnesia, crystallize. They present\r\ncrystals of large size. Again dissolved and concentrated, the latter salt\r\nis separated from the two former by its greater solubility; and the new\r\nsolution, when crystallized, furnishes the Saidschitz salt—a tolerably\r\npure sulphate of magnesia. The popular term in Germany for sulphate\r\nof magnesia corresponding to our “Epsom salt” is “bittersalz;” but it\r\nis known also as Saidschitz and Püllna salz; so that, if you enter a\r\nchemist’s, and demand a salt with either of the above titles, he will\r\nsupply you from a certain bottle, labelled sal-amarum. If you ask for\r\nSedlitz-salt, he will smile at your ignorance, and quietly tell you he\r\ndoes not keep it; and for this, we shall presently see, there is the very\r\nbest of reasons. The prince is said to get about 1200 florins of good\r\nAustrian money annually by his salt making.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEDLITZ.\r\n\r\nIt is but a quarter of an hour’s drive from Saidschitz to Sedlitz; a name\r\nbetter known, perhaps, in England, than that of any other spa in Germany.\r\nFor who has not had a Sedlitz? a _genuine_ Sedlitz? or who has not bought\r\na box of these powders, with the acid in the blue and the alkali in the\r\nwhite paper? as though the wondrous spring could produce a salt, acid or\r\nalkaline, at the pleasure of the chemist who dispensed it?\r\n\r\nLarge manufactories indeed must be there! and how thriving a village\r\nSedlitz must be!! A few miserable hovels, however, soon undeceive you,\r\ntenanted by the poorest of the poor. There are nine springs, not separate\r\nfrom the village of the same name, as at Saidschitz, but interspersed\r\namong the houses; and really it requires no small discernment to\r\ndistinguish which are dwelling-houses, and which represent the wooden\r\nsheds covering the wells. Spring, No. 2, is the only one in use; and\r\nwell, No. 2, the only one supplied with a bucket. The bucket was lowered\r\nby a rope and windlass (just conceive how civilized a bath-place); and\r\nbrought up, full of water, for our inspection. I was not caught twice;\r\nI did not venture to taste this Bitterwasser with so much rashness. Its\r\ntaste, color, and other physical properties, are exactly similar to\r\nthose of Saidschitz-water, except that they are rather less marked, from\r\nits containing a smaller quantity of mineral ingredients. The following\r\nanalysis by Professor Steinmann will be interesting.\r\n\r\nSixteen ounces contain,\r\n\r\n  Sulphate of soda                                        17.446\r\n  Sulphate of potash                                       4.414\r\n  Sulphate of magnesia                                    79.555\r\n  Sulphate of lime                                         4.144\r\n  Chloride of magnesium                                    1.061\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia                                    0.201\r\n  Carbonate of lime                                        5.297\r\n  Carbonate of stronthian                                   .009\r\n  Carbonate of protoxyde of iron and manganese, alumina,\r\n    silica and extractive                                   .050\r\n                                                         -------\r\n                                                         112.177 grs.\r\n                                                         -------\r\n  Carbonic acid gas                                        3.461 grs.\r\n\r\nBut where is the salt-manufactory, asked Dr. Richter? The woman was\r\nastonished—she knew not, nor had she ever heard of such a thing, although\r\nshe had been in charge of the wells for thirty years. Her aged mother\r\nsolved the difficulty. About thirty-three years ago. Prince Lobkowitz\r\nrented Sedlitz of the “ordre des chevaliers de l’etoile rouge,” and then\r\na salt apparatus was in action. Finding, I presume, that Saidschitz was\r\na more prolific source of bittersalz, he stopped the process at Sedlitz;\r\nso that absolutely, for the thirty-three long years that we have been\r\ndrinking and enjoying our _genuine_ Sedlitz powders, not a single atom of\r\nsalt has been prepared.\r\n\r\nBut it is said, Saidschitz salt has been prepared, it imports little,\r\nthat the mere name should have been mis-spelt. I answer—truly; a mere\r\nverbal error is of no moment; but when it is found, that the salt of\r\nSaidschitz and Sedlitz waters is sulphate of magnesia or Epsom salts;\r\nand when further it is observed, that the renowned Sedlitz powders are\r\ncomposed, for the most part, of Rochelle salt, or the triple tartrate\r\nof potash and soda, I confess, it seems that more than a verbal error is\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nLike Saidschitz, the waters of Sedlitz are bottled at the establishment\r\nof Prince Lobkowitz, at Bilin. Some is sent into Germany; by far the\r\ngreater part goes to Paris; none to England. The bottles are known by\r\nthe peculiar manner in which they are stopped; they have metal collars\r\nround the necks, on which metal caps are screwed. It is a singular\r\ncircumstance, that, at Teplitz, not a single bottle of Sedlitz water\r\ncould be obtained.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting Prince Lobkowitz and his springs, I may notice another\r\ningenious application of the Saidschitz water. At Bilin there is a\r\nmineral spring, containing the carbonate of soda, about 23 grains in\r\nthe pint. The result is anticipated. It is concentrated considerably by\r\nevaporation, and mixed with the Saidschitz water, also much concentrated;\r\na double decomposition of the proximate elements of the carbonate of soda\r\nin the one, and the sulphate of magnesia in the other water, ensues: and\r\na very capital carbonate magnesia is precipitated. The prince is said\r\nto add 500 more florins of good Austrian money to his income by this\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPÜLLNA,\r\n\r\nThe last of the three bitter springs, lying on the road from Carlsbad\r\nto Teplitz, is the property of the village of that name, close by, but\r\nis rented at present, by a private individual. Compared with the two\r\nformer, it is quite an elegant spot. There is even a small white hotel\r\nopposite the wells; where, if fortune smiles, and you are in time for\r\nTable-d’hôte, you may get a dinner; but if not, you must fare, as we did,\r\non “butter-brod.” It contains, moreover, a few baths, supplied with water\r\nfrom the springs; and one patient, Baron Christophe de Campenhausen, with\r\nhis medical attendant, was resident there for the cure. An attempt at\r\na registry of the visitors is also made. About thirty people, perhaps,\r\nmay have seen Püllna, certainly not more than half a dozen English. Of\r\nthe three bittersprings, the waters of Püllna have been by far the most\r\ndrank—it is said that 300,000 of the Püllna dumpty bottles are annually\r\ncirculated. Bittersalz is also made here in considerable quantity.\r\n\r\nThe wells are scattered over a larger area than either at Saidschitz or\r\nSedlitz; but have the same odd appearance. The physical characters of\r\na bitterwasser, its yellow tint, oily consistence, and horribly bitter\r\ntaste, are here most strongly marked. The last analysis (which I obtained\r\nat Püllna) is by Dr. Ticinus, professor of chemistry at Dresden; and it\r\nwill be seen how extremely concentrated a water it is.\r\n\r\nSixteen ounces contain—\r\n\r\n  Sulphate of soda                      10.125\r\n  Sulphate of potash                    82.720\r\n  Sulphate of magnesia                  96.975\r\n  Sulphate of lime                        .800\r\n  Chloride magnesium                    19.120\r\n  Bromide magnesium                       .588\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia                  2.280\r\n  Carbonate of lime                       .760\r\n  Carbonate of iron                     traces\r\n  Nitrate of magnesia                    4.602\r\n  Crenate of magnesia                    4.640\r\n  Phosphate of soda                       .290\r\n                                       -------\r\n                                       222.900\r\n                                       -------\r\n  Carbonic acid gas          .49 cubic inches.\r\n\r\nI shall add but one word on the medical properties of the bitterwassers.\r\nAs a glance at the analyses would anticipate, they are solvent and\r\ndiuretic. They are aperient, however, without being at the same time\r\nstimulating; as is the case with the Salzbrunn at Franzensbad, from its\r\nabundance of carbonic acid, and with the Carlsbad water, from its heat.\r\nThey, especially the Püllna, which is employed the most frequently, are\r\ntoo strong to be taken pure. One-third to the half of a dumpty bottle,\r\nwith an equal quantity of luke-warm water, will be found an efficient and\r\ntolerably palatable dose. A medicine of this kind, repeated regularly\r\nevery morning, is of the greatest advantage to persons habitually costive\r\nfrom sluggishness of action in the muscular fibre of the intestine,\r\nbrought on by sedentary lives, much study at late hours, &c. If this\r\nstate be accompanied with hæmorrhoids, the remedy, from its gentle\r\neffect, is still more valuable. In congested states of the liver and\r\nspleen, they are efficient; blood is determined to the intestine, to\r\nthe relief of the portal vessels. In actual jaundice, they are even\r\nprescribed with advantage.\r\n\r\nIn mentioning the leading properties of these bittersprings, I do not\r\nthink I should be inclined (were he willing) to send a patient there; for\r\nI should expect to hear, either that he had been upset in his journey, or\r\nstarved on his arrival. But I have another motive. From the very nature\r\nof the water, containing so little carbonic acid, and so little iron, it\r\ncan be imitated with great success. I saw Struve’s process at Dresden;\r\nand I have taken that made at the Brighton spa, with all the effect of\r\nthe original and genuine Püllna. It seemed to me a remedy worthy of more\r\npatronage than it had hitherto received.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would not wish, from what I have said, to depreciate the\r\ncharacter of our very old and tried friend, the “Sedlitz.” On the\r\ncontrary—I hold him in much veneration. One word only I would add to his\r\ntitle—I would call him the “GENUINE (LONDON) SEDLITZ POWDER.”\r\n\r\n                                                        ROBERT J. SPITTA.\r\n\r\nP.S.—I may as well state here, for the information of travellers, and\r\nespecially of invalids, the ready means of communication that now exist,\r\nindependent of the rail-road abovementioned.\r\n\r\n  From Teplitz to Tetchen                                        4 hours.\r\n  From Tetchen (through the heart of Saxon Switzerland by\r\n    steamer) to Dresden                                         12   ”\r\n  From Dresden to Magdeburg (passing through Leipzig—rail-road)  8   ”\r\n  Magdeburg to Hamburg (steam)                                  14   ”\r\n  Hamburg to London                                             48   ”\r\n                                                               ---\r\n  Total                                                         86 hours.\r\n                                                               ---\r\n\r\nThe whole run may be done in six days; the traveller sleeping every night\r\nin his bed, and undergoing no fatigue whatever in the day. The opposite\r\ncourse will require an additional day, on account of the stream of the\r\nElbe, but may be performed with great ease by all, to whom economy of\r\ntime, money, and bodily exertion is of any moment. It is only an easy\r\nday’s journey from Teplitz to Carlsbad, and 24 miles from thence to\r\nMarienbad. The route through Saxon Switzerland alone, will well repay the\r\njourney, which is almost all by water, and the far greater part by river\r\nsteaming, where there is no chance of sea-sickness. In fine, the line of\r\nthe Elbe offers, as it were, an invalid carriage, by which the most frail\r\nvaletudinarian, or the most crippled victim of gout or rheumatism, may\r\nrepair to the great fountains of health in Bohemia, with almost as much\r\nease as if reposing in an arm-chair. J. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELBE—SAXON SWITZERLAND. TEPLITZ TO TETCHEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULM.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Teplitz, we pass through a highly picturesque country, full\r\nof mountain scenery, but not of that Alpine grandeur which excludes\r\nfertility, cultivation, and beauty, till we come to the Thermopylæ of\r\nBohemia—the battle-field of Culm—whose history, though “Ære perennius,”\r\nis yet commemorated by three monuments—the Russian and Prussian dedicated\r\nto the memory of those heroes who fell in the combat—the Austrian, to\r\nthe general who turned the fortune of the day—and changed a doubtful\r\nand sanguinary battle into a splendid and decided victory.[84] The\r\nthree monuments are of very different stature and dimensions. The first\r\nwe come to is the Russian, a Gothic pyramid of cast iron, of great\r\nheight, bearing on its summit the figure of Fame. The portrait of the\r\nhero OSTERMAN, who, with 8000 Russians, checked Vandamme and 40,000\r\nFrenchmen, is sculptured on one side. This monument is like Russia\r\nitself, infinitely more colossal than either of the others. The Prussian,\r\nlike its kingdom, is the smallest of all—while the Austrian, is next\r\nin dimensions to the Russian, and dedicated, as was observed, to the\r\nhero who conquered, and not to those who fell in the battle. After all,\r\nthis was perhaps the wisest plan. The living hero would feel pride and\r\npleasure in contemplating the monuments; but, alas!\r\n\r\n    “Can storied urn or animated bust\r\n      Back to its mansion draw the fleeting breath?\r\n    Can honour’s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\n      Or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death?”\r\n\r\nNo! the blood of the brave has, no doubt, fertilized the soil of this\r\nbeautiful valley, while the bodies of heroes, who drew their natal breath\r\non the banks of the Gneiper and the Vistula—the Elbe and the Danube—the\r\nRhine and the Rhone—the Seine and the Tiber, have served to fatten the\r\nbirds and beasts of prey, as well as the mould of mother-earth—migrating\r\ninto myriads of new existences, and completing the mysterious circle of\r\nthe SAMIAN SAGE!\r\n\r\nWhen we glance at this infinitessimal speck of human consciousness and\r\nidentity, surrounded and swallowed up by the countless cycles of other\r\nand ephemeral modes of existence, we may well marvel that MAN—reasoning\r\nman—should be the only creature on this globe who wages eternal\r\nwar—against his own species! One would think that the span of human life\r\nwas narrow enough, without abridging or annihilating it by fire, famine,\r\nand the sword! War indeed is a game which—\r\n\r\n                        ——were their subjects wise,\r\n    Kings _could_ not play at.\r\n\r\nIt is rather singular that, in our days, at least, though monarchs\r\noccasionally lose their crowns in these games of _hazard_, they rarely\r\npart with their heads at the same time.\r\n\r\nThree Emperors and a King played one of those fearful games of _hazard_\r\nin the valley of Culm. From the summit of the Schlossberg the royal\r\nEagles of Austria, Russia, and Prussia beheld, with astonishment, if\r\nnot dismay, the sudden and unexpected descent through a gorge in the\r\nErzebirge mountains, the fierce, the rapacious, and the ferocious\r\nVANDAMME, at the head of forty thousand Frenchmen, flushed with the\r\nvictory of Dresden (27th August, 1813) and pouncing on the scattered\r\ntroops of the allies in the valley, quite unprepared for such an\r\nunexpected onslaught! The “COCK OF THE NORTH,” and HE of the Danube,\r\n“immediately retired.” Not so the regal bird, with two heads, from\r\nthe Elbe and the Oder. He clapped his sable wings, as he snuffed the\r\nsulphurous fumes from the roaring cannon—directed several movements of\r\nthe allies below—and presented a wall of steel, to a cloud of cossacks,\r\nflying before the enemy—thus compelling them to face their foes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, OSTERMAN and his eight thousand Russians slowly and doggedly\r\nretreated (fighting) before Vandamme and his forty thousand French,\r\ntill within two miles of Teplitz, when the Gallic general considered\r\nthe crowned heads as inevitably within his grasp! Here the Muscovites\r\nstopped short—wheeled round—and crossed the narrow valley, like an avenue\r\nof knotted oaks that might be borne down or torn up by the furious\r\nstorm or lightning’s flash, but never would bend. It was in vain that\r\nthe “ferocious” Vandamme brought up line after line of his men against\r\nthe northern phalanx. They were repulsed, one after the other, as the\r\nbasaltic columns of Staffa repel the onsets of the Atlantic surge! As\r\nindividuals fell in the Russian ranks, the lines instantly closed again,\r\nas if by a vital and instinctive movement of the whole body! When the\r\nlast column of Vandamme had failed to break the Russian phalanx, the\r\nfurious and disconcerted Frank retreated in his turn, and encamped on the\r\nfield of Culm for the night. This gave time for the panic-stricken and\r\ndisordered allies to collect, combine, and arrange for the grand struggle\r\nof the coming day. The dawn (30th August) had not yet unveiled the peaks\r\nof the surrounding mountains, when all were ready and panting for the\r\nsanguinary conflict.\r\n\r\n    By torch and trumpet soon array’d,\r\n    Each horseman drew his battle-blade,\r\n    And furious every charger neigh’d,\r\n      To join the dreadful revelry.\r\n\r\n    Then flew the steed, to battle driv’n—\r\n    Then shook the hills, with thunder riven—\r\n    And louder than the bolts of heaven,\r\n      Far flash’d the red artillery!\r\n\r\nThe allies under Schwartzenburg may now have outnumbered the French\r\nunder Vandamme, but their _morale_ was depressed by the recent disasters\r\nat Dresden, and their _physique_ exhausted by their almost superhuman\r\nexertions in dragging their cannon, baggage, and ammunition over the\r\nrugged summits of the Bohemian mountains. On the other hand, the French\r\nwere elated beyond measure by the recent and successive victories of\r\nLutzen, Botzen, and Dresden—but still more by the star of Napoleon,\r\nwhich was now rising, like a Phœnix from the ashes of Moscow, and\r\napproaching its second zenith on the banks of the Elbe. Daylight,\r\nhowever, had scarcely enabled the armies to distinguish friend from\r\nfoe, when they rushed simultaneously into mortal conflict. Vandamme lay\r\nbetween a great crescent of the allies on the West, and the towery ridge\r\nof Erzeberg in his rear, and from which he had descended the preceding\r\nmorning. The “fiery Frank” fought like a tiger encompassed and goaded\r\nby hunters—while the “furious HUN” successfully repelled his repeated\r\nefforts to break the line of the allies, and even drove him nearer and\r\nnearer to the mountain behind. The pass of the Erzeberg, through which\r\nVandamme descended into the valley, now presented the only opening by\r\nwhich he could effect his egress out of it. The order for retreat was\r\ngiven; but what was the surprize of the French on entering the defile\r\nfrom below, when they beheld a body of Prussians enter it from above! The\r\nsurprize and consternation, however, were mutual. Kleist, who, with five\r\nor six thousand Prussians, had been wandering among the mountains since\r\nthe disaster of Dresden, and who was now hurrying to Teplitz to join the\r\nallies, was thunderstruck to see the French scrambling up the defile to\r\nmeet him, and considered his retreat as cut off. Vandamme looked upon\r\nhimself as in precisely the same predicament. Kleist knew that the French\r\ncolumns were pressing onward in his rear—Vandamme knew full well that the\r\nAustro-Prusso-Russian army was close at his heels. The object of each\r\ncorps in the defile was therefore to cut through its opponent, and escape\r\nin the direction of its friends. Under these impressions, they rushed\r\ninto tumultuous combat, and were soon mingled in inextricable confusion.\r\nThe officers of one corps were sometimes in the midst of the soldiery of\r\nthe other, and _vice versa_—all fighting pell-mell like two hostile mobs,\r\nwithout order or command—individually rather than collectively—often\r\nwresting the arms from their opponents, and fighting with the weapons of\r\ntheir enemies! So desperate a struggle on such a precipitous pass, was\r\nnever, perhaps, witnessed since the days of Leonidas in the Straits of\r\nThermopylæ! The Prussians had the vantage ground, inasmuch as their own\r\nweight gave them an increased momentum in rushing down the declivity—the\r\nFrench had greatly the advantage in numbers, both in horse and foot; but\r\nKleist prevailed, and Vandamme and his army were hurled back into the\r\nvalley below, when the allies closed round them and the Gallic Eagles\r\nsurrendered!\r\n\r\nOn the field of Culm the sable wing of destiny threw a shade over the\r\nstar of Napoleon, which never afterwards regained its splendour, or\r\nstayed its downward course, till it sunk in the far Atlantic. On the\r\nplains of Marne and Waterloo, indeed,[85] that star emitted some vivid\r\ncorruscations; but they only tended to exhaust its fire and accelerate\r\nits fall!\r\n\r\n\r\nTETCHEN.\r\n\r\nFull of ruminations on the vicissitudes of human life—the vanity of\r\nman’s hopes—and the nothingness of his works—we drove through a highly\r\npicturesque valley, at the foot of the last range of the Bohemian\r\nmountains, till we suddenly debouched on the silvery Elbe, at the\r\nbustling and boating little town of Tetchen. The first object which\r\narrested our attention was a huge pile of white buildings standing on a\r\nbold and jutting promontory some seven or eight hundred feet above the\r\nright bank of the river, with thrice as many windows in its walls as\r\nthere were eyes in the head of Argus. Various were our conjectures as\r\nto whether the edifice before us was an immense barrack, an overgrown\r\nconvent, where half the daughters of Bohemia might prepare for another\r\nworld, or a great factory? Even the oracular authority of the “RED-BOOK”\r\ncould not persuade us that it was a palace. The river at this place\r\nis always crowded with boats of all shapes and sizes laden with\r\nmerchandize—chiefly hewn stone from the rocky banks, and timber from\r\nthe pine-clad mountains. We had some difficulty in getting the carriage\r\nalong between a precipice on the left, and the stream on our right, but\r\nat length got safely housed in the JOSEPHSBAD Hotel—“in one of the most\r\nromantic situations which the banks of the river Elbe afford.”—_Murray._\r\nHere we learnt that the great pile of building was actually the palace\r\nor castle of Count Thun, and crossing the ferry we scrambled up through\r\na straggling town to the rear of the castle, and then climbed up a road\r\nof rock that led to the chateau, and which was steep enough for goats,\r\nthough the tracks of wheels, worn in the smooth and precipitous stone,\r\nshewed that less agile animals than the ibex had dragged their weary\r\nway to the summit. The view from the castle is remarkably picturesque,\r\nthough rather hemmed in by hills, rocks, and mountains—the winding Elbe\r\nsoon disappearing in the dark ravines of SAXON SWITZERLAND. Count Thun’s\r\nlibrary is, I believe, the great lion of the castle; but as I never\r\ncould derive much amusement or information from a survey of the backs of\r\nbooks, we returned to our eagle’s nest, the Josephsbad, and slept sound\r\nover the murmuring Elbe. There is a chalybeate spring here of some local\r\nreputation, and certainly an invalid could not easily select a more\r\nromantic spot for the restoration of health than Tetchen.\r\n\r\nWe embarked in a gondola early in the morning, and immediately entered\r\n“SAXON SWITZERLAND,” a tract of country extending from Tetchen to the\r\nneighbourhood of Dresden, and perfectly unique in character, bearing\r\nlittle or no resemblance to Switzerland, or to any other country in the\r\nworld through which I have passed. It has none of the snowy solitudes,\r\nthe sparkling glaciers, or the majestic altitude of the Alps; but it\r\nhas a geographical and geological physiognomy, of which there is “nil\r\nsimile aut secundum” on this globe. The river runs through a gorge, which\r\nis, in fact, a gigantic excavation—a huge crevasse—a profound chasm, in\r\nthe rocky bed of an antediluvian ocean, disclosing glimpses of “the\r\nworld before the flood,” and letting out some of the “secrets of the\r\nprison-house.” Whether this ocean-bed was raised from its dark abyss by\r\nthe agency of subterranean fire, or was left uncovered by the subsidence\r\nof the superincumbent sea, may admit of question; but no doubt can be\r\nentertained as to the formation of those rocky walls that now rise a\r\nthousand feet high on each side of the stream. They are piled, layer\r\nover layer, in strata of different thickness and different density—but\r\nall as horizontal as the ocean under which they once lay. They were all,\r\ntherefore, depositions from the sea, and considering that most of these\r\nstrata are hard enough to form millstones, imagination is lost in the\r\nvain attempt to estimate the countless ages that must have rolled away\r\nduring the deposition and consolidation of even a single stratum—how many\r\nmillions of years, then, must it have required to form layer over layer,\r\nof this immense crust, at the bottom of the ocean, leaving aside the\r\nunknown intervals that must have elapsed between the various deposits!!\r\nAgain, the elevation of the earth, or the subsidence of the waters, so as\r\nto produce the complete denudation of this rocky district, could not but\r\noccupy ages of ages. In whatever way this long chain of stratifications\r\ntook place, it is quite evident that it was long subjected to powerful\r\ncurrents. The layers are all grooved and furrowed _horizontally_, in the\r\nline of the river, and not _perpendicularly_, as by rains descending\r\nalong their sides. It is true they are often split perpendicularly and\r\nirregularly; but this is quite the work of time and decay—not at all\r\nlike the horizontal smoothing, the consequence of long-continued watery\r\nfriction. Some travellers have supposed that the river Elbe has hewn its\r\nway through these rocks and formed the huge ravine on the principle—\r\n\r\n    “Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed sæpe cadendo.”\r\n\r\nBut as the very summits of the rock (800 feet high) shew the same proofs\r\nof horizontal “wear and tear” as the lowest strata, what must have\r\nbeen the state of the surrounding country, when the Elbe was 800 feet\r\nabove its present level? It was covered with water, and the grooves\r\nin the rocks were the effects of currents, not rivers—in other words,\r\nthey are _diluvial_ and not _fluvial_ phenomena. But the banks of this\r\nstream are not the only places here which exhibit proofs and records of\r\na deluge. The neighbouring country, especially on the right bank, and\r\nwhere no rivers exist, is studded with “fragments of an earlier world,”\r\nall bearing the same marks of watery attrition, from their highest to\r\ntheir lowest strata. Although many of these “splinter’d pinnacles,”\r\nare columnar in shape, they are tabular in construction—all shewing\r\nhorizontal strata (where they have not tumbled down), and all evincing a\r\ngreater wear and tear of the interstitial materials between the layers,\r\nthan of the layers themselves—another proof of the lateral and not\r\nperpendicular action of the waters by which they were worn smooth.\r\n\r\nWe descended slowly in our gondola, the day being splendidly clear,\r\nand the wind blowing fresh against us, which retarded our progress,\r\nbut favoured our examination of the infinitely varied scenery in this\r\nromantic gorge. At Neidergrund, on the left bank, we were stopped by the\r\nlast Austrian Douane, for examination of passports; and then continued\r\nour descent. At this place, however, there is a huge fragment of rock\r\nwhich must have rolled from the adjacent cliff, at some remote period,\r\nbut which is now perfectly smooth in every part of its surface, from\r\nthe friction of the floods. In this stone, there is also a polished\r\nexcavation, with a narrow door, in which, it is said, a pious hermit\r\nonce resided. Hence its name—“MONCHENSTEIN.” It is worth examining while\r\nthe tardy Douanier is poring over your passport, and filling unmeaning\r\ncolumns in his musty journals.\r\n\r\nA league farther on, where the right bank rises like a wall to a\r\nstupendous height, and demonstrating the stratifications with peculiar\r\ndistinctness, we come to a huge pile of buildings, overhung by massive\r\ncrags of rocks, and forming a douane, police-station, and hotel. Here\r\nwe encounter the Saxon Custom-house, where our trunks were opened and\r\nexamined—an operation which was never once performed by Prussian,\r\nBavarian, or Austrian, during our whole journey. And here I must do the\r\nAustrians, who are represented as so very _austere_ in their police and\r\ndouanes, the justice to say that, in no part of their dominions did we\r\never experience the slightest interruption or inconvenience in respect to\r\npassports; nor did they ever ask us for the key of a trunk on entering,\r\ntravelling through, or quitting their territories.\r\n\r\nFrom this place (Herrnskretchen), excursions are often made, by\r\npeople who have plenty of time on their hands, to the summit of the\r\n“WINTERBERG,” where a very extensive prospect of Saxon Switzerland and\r\nthe Bohemian ranges is obtained. The mountain prospect is hardly worth\r\nthe toil of the mountain journey. Better prospects are obtained from\r\ntwo points to be presently noticed, where the view, though not quite so\r\nwide, is infinitely more distinct and striking, and where the points\r\nthemselves possess the highest degree of interest, which the summit of\r\nthe Winterberg does not. The PREBERCHTHOR, however, a league and a half\r\nfrom Herrnskretchen, is worth seeing. It is a gigantic natural arch of\r\nrock, exhibiting well the stratified formation, and looking like the\r\nportal of some enchanted castle, being 60 ells (French) in height, the\r\nsame in breadth, and 30 in depth. The arch itself is 1400 feet and more\r\nabove the level of the sea. The summit, or key-stone of the arch forms a\r\nkind of narrow slanting platform, 30 or 40 feet in length, from which a\r\nromantic prospect opens on the view.\r\n\r\nThe Kuhstall (or cow-house) is another natural arch, where the strata of\r\nrock appear to be somewhat bent as they stride over the aperture below.\r\nVarious other “disjecta membra” of an antediluvian world are scattered\r\nabout between the Winterberg and Schandau.\r\n\r\nWe remained but a short time at Schandau; and, after dinner, hired a\r\ngondola, where a female rowed manfully against the breeze, assisted by\r\nher husband and brother, and in a couple of hours we reached\r\n\r\n\r\nKŒNIGSTEIN.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the lions of Saxon Switzerland—a kind of jung-frau\r\nfortress that has never yielded to shot, shell, or escalade. It is\r\nsituated on the left bank of the river, near the town of Kœnigstein, from\r\nwhence we ascended by a long and steep road that required full an hour\r\nbefore we arrived at the gate of this impregnable fortress. The Saxon\r\nwar minister being governor of Kœnigstein, our passports procured us\r\nadmission, with an orderly to shew us round. One of the most prominent\r\nfeatures of this country is, the projection from its surface of numerous\r\ntruncated cones of the same kind of stratified rock which compose the\r\nbanks of the Elbe. They rise almost perpendicularly from plain or hill,\r\nto various heights of one hundred to seven or eight hundred feet, with\r\na flat surface on the top, like a sugar-loaf with its upper third cut\r\noff. Kœnigstein is one of the largest of these natural forts, and the\r\nstrongest. It springs from an elevated ground, and is at least fifteen\r\nhundred feet above the level of the Elbe that flows at its base. The\r\nwalls are not columnar, but masses of horizontal strata piled upon one\r\nanother, precisely like those composing the banks of the river, the\r\nhighest as well as lowest layers presenting the same horizontal “wear\r\nand tear,” produced by the action of long-continued currents of water.\r\nThe plateau on the summit of this antediluvian citadel occupies a space\r\nof two or three acres, which, considering the locality, supports a good\r\ndeal of vegetation, trees, and fruit. Excavations in the rock serve\r\nas bomb-proofs for provisions, ammunition, and military barracks, if\r\nassailed. The plateau is encircled by a coronet of cannon and mortars,\r\nand in the spaces between the embrasures, immense heaps of stones are\r\npiled up, to be hurled on the heads of those who ventured to approach\r\nthe rocky ramparts of this aerial fortress. Down through the centre of\r\nthe rock a well is bored to the depth of 1800 feet, and from this source\r\nan abundant supply of excellent water is drawn up by a wheel, like a\r\ntread-mill, worked, or rather walked, by half a dozen soldiers. In the\r\ncentre of the plateau there is a circus, where the governor with one of\r\nhis aide-de-camps was galloping round, for air and exercise.\r\n\r\nWe made the entire circuit of the ramparts, and from these the most\r\nextensive views are taken in every direction, embracing scenery so\r\nstrange, romantic, and beautiful, that no language can do it justice—nor\r\npencil neither! At its eastern base flows the winding Elbe, and directly\r\nopposite, on the other side of the stream, rises LILIENSTEIN, about\r\nthree miles distant from Kœnigstein, and of a precisely similar shape\r\nand composition. A German prince, who was also a Polish king, had the\r\ncourage and dexterity to scale the _Lilienstein_, and was so proud of\r\nthe exploit, that he commemorated it by an inscription near the place of\r\nascent. Napoleon, in one of his German forays, succeeded, with incredible\r\nlabour and difficulty, to elevate some guns to the summit of this\r\ngigantic rock, in order to batter Kœnigstein, but his labour was lost,\r\nfor the shot fell short of the sister fortress. But Kœnigstein might\r\nhave laughed at Bonaparte even if his cannon could have swept the houses\r\nfrom the plateau of the Saxon strong-hold. It would have remained as\r\nimpregnable as ever. The view from this spot takes in the whole or nearly\r\nthe whole of Saxon Switzerland, and extends to thirty or forty miles in\r\nevery direction—from the Winterberg to DRESDEN, the towers of which are\r\nplainly visible. All the peculiar rocks in the shape of truncated cones,\r\nas well as those masses of pillars and cliffs about the Bastei, are\r\ndistinctly seen from Kœnigstein. Mr. Russell has the following passage in\r\nhis work on Germany.\r\n\r\n“The striking feature is, that in the bosom of this amphitheatre, a plain\r\nof the most varied beauty, huge columnar hills start up at once from the\r\nground, at great distances from each other, overlooking in lonely and\r\nsolemn grandeur, each its own portion of the domain. _They are monuments\r\nwhich the Elbe has left standing to commemorate his triumph over their\r\nless hardy kindred._ The most remarkable among them are the Lilienstein\r\nand Kœnigstein, which tower, nearly in the centre of the plain, to a\r\nheight of above 1200 feet above the Elbe.”\r\n\r\nI have marked a sentence, in italics, because it conveys an erroneous\r\nidea. It may be poetical; but it is not philosophical. If the Elbe was\r\nthe Deluge, or the Deluge was the Elbe, all well. But I think Mr. Russell\r\nwould hardly contend for this identity. The fact is, that the DELUGE wore\r\naway the softer parts from around Kœnigstein, Lilienstein, and all the\r\nother Steins, ten thousand, or, more likely, ten million of years before\r\nthe Elbe was born! The diminutive stream of the river merely conducted\r\nits rills from the mountains through the bottom of the chasm hollowed out\r\nby the mighty currents of an antediluvian ocean.\r\n\r\nIt required two hours to visit the cloud-capt towers and frowning\r\nbattlements of this impregnable citadel, whose walls were not built by\r\nhuman hands, but constructed beneath the waters of some mighty deep.\r\nThe magnificent and singular scenery which everywhere bursts on the\r\nastonished eye from the cannon-crown’d crest of Kœnigstein, can never be\r\nerased from the memory.\r\n\r\nWe descended from the fortress to the town, tired, hunger’d, but highly\r\ngratified by the excursion. Fickle Fortune is not always profuse of\r\nher gifts. The feast of the eye this day was purchased by a fast of\r\nthe stomach. Notwithstanding the care we had taken to order the “HUHN\r\nGEBRATEN,” the “SCHINKEN,” the “KARTOFLEN,” and other little matters\r\nfor dinner, all of which were civilly promised, with a hearty “ja wohl\r\nmynheer,” into the bargain; yet, to our mortification, up came the\r\ninfernal or at least the eternal dish—mutton-chops, composed of old meat\r\npounded into a paste, squeezed into a mould, fried with butter, covered\r\nwith flour, and pierced with the ribs of some “_schaf_” that might have\r\nbeen slaughtered the preceding year! Remonstrance was vain, and complaint\r\nwas unavailing. Dish after dish was returned untouched—and dish after\r\ndish of the _same materials_, came back again, in other forms! With a\r\nsorrowful heart and an empty stomach, I called to mind the first line of\r\nOvid’s Metamorphoses—\r\n\r\n    “In _nova_, fert animus, _mutatas_ dicere _formas_,\r\n    _Corpora_.”\r\n\r\nAs a forlorn hope, we requested some cheese; when, lo, after a quarter\r\nof an hour’s expectation, in came a wedge exhaling such a complication\r\nof all horrible and unutterable odours, that we were glad to launch\r\nit out of the window among the pigs—and even they scampered off in\r\nall directions at the sight, sound, and smell of this unexpected\r\nand apparently unwelcome visitor! Good comes out of evil. This last\r\nconsummation of our miseries fortunately obliterated our appetites\r\nas effectually as a fit of sea-sickness in a gale of wind. The beds\r\nwere as bad as the board, and the smell of the cheese seemed to have\r\ncalled forth myriads of the most minute, agile, and animated beings,\r\nwho appeared to _leap_ and skip with joy, over our beds and round our\r\ndormitory—but whether in search of the savoury “kase,” or bent on more\r\nsanguinary depredations, I will not pretend to decide. This I know, that\r\nthe frolicksome gambols of these black and saltant imps conduced but\r\nvery little to sleep, notwithstanding the lightness of our supper. Mr.\r\nMurray says that the INN at Kœnigstein is “tolerable.” It may be so, but\r\nthe INMATES are intolerable! I do not think that Horace spent a worse\r\nnight in the Pontine fens, when he was assailed, on one side by the “mali\r\nculices,” and on the other, by the “ranæ palustres.” We had not the\r\n“_mali culices_,” it is true—but we had far worse customers, the _mali\r\npulices!!_ In fine, it was the “frogs and flies” of Treponti in Italy,\r\n_versus_ the “fleas and cheese” of Kœnigstein in Germany. I would pit the\r\n_latter_ against the _former_ any Summer’s night of the year!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASTEI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Kœnigstein early on a beautiful morning in our gondola, and in\r\ntwo hours we were housed in New Raden, at the foot of the BASTEI. Having\r\nprocured a guide, we commenced a laborious and steep zig-zag ascent\r\ntowards the summit of the arch-lion of Saxon Switzerland. It required an\r\nhour or nearly so, to accomplish this task—each tourniquet of the ascent\r\nopening out more and more extended and splendid prospects. At length we\r\ngot into the “regio petrea,” or stony region—sometimes winding round the\r\nbases of huge cliffs—sometimes squeezing through narrow fissures of the\r\nrock—and at others, crossing profound chasms over slender wooden bridges,\r\nor rather foot-paths. When almost despairing of gaining the summit before\r\nour strength was exhausted, we suddenly found ourselves on a small but\r\nlevel platform, on the highest pinnacle of the Bastei, and commanding a\r\ncomplete view, not only of the immense mass of splintered rocks around\r\nus, but of the whole country in every direction. In all my peregrinations\r\nround this globe, I never met with any locality or prospect similar to\r\nthe one which burst on my astonished sight at this place!\r\n\r\n    I’ve travers’d many a mountain strand,\r\n    Abroad and in my native land;—\r\n    And it has been my fate to tread,\r\n    Where safety more than pleasure led—\r\n        But by my Halidome—\r\n\r\n    A scene so rude, so wild as this—\r\n    Or so sublime in barrenness,\r\n    Ne’er did my wandering footsteps press,\r\n        Where’er I chanc’d to roam!\r\n\r\nWe stood on the verge of a tremendous precipice, eight hundred feet in\r\nheight, and overhanging the Elbe below. Though its brow is fringed with\r\nan iron ballustrade, I observed that very few ventured to look over the\r\nfrightful bourne,\r\n\r\n    “Lest the brain turn and the deficient sight\r\n    Topple down headlong.”\r\n\r\nIn the opposite direction, rises one of the most singular scenes that\r\never opened on the human eye. The billows of an angry ocean suddenly\r\nconverted into stone, while agitated by a furious hurricane, might\r\nconvey some, but a very imperfect, idea of this astonishing locality.\r\nThe fractured rocks, though all presenting the stratifications so often\r\nmentioned, and most of them still horizontal, assume almost every shape\r\nand form that imagination bodies forth in the autumnal clouds that range\r\nthemselves along the western horizon, as the cortege of a setting sun, on\r\na beautiful evening. Pyramids, cliffs, spires, columns, ruins, cupolas,\r\nturrets, battlements, castles, colossal statues and fantastic figures—of\r\neverything, in short, which a fertile fancy can conjure up in the animate\r\nor inanimate world.[86]\r\n\r\nAfter the first emotions of surprize and astonishment have subsided, we\r\nbegin to ask ourselves what convulsion of Nature could have produced\r\nthis scene of devastation, destruction, and dislocation? Was it an\r\nearthquake?—a volcano?—or a DELUGE? Coupling this last idea with the\r\nacknowledged fact that all these fractured rocks were once a series\r\nof level and solid strata at the bottom of the ocean, the remarkable\r\nexpression in Holy Writ rushed on the mind—“And the fountains of\r\nthe great deep were broken up.” Whether this indescribable scene of\r\ndisruption and dilapidation was produced by any one of those three\r\ncauses, or by all in succession, must for ever remain a secret sealed\r\nfrom human ken,—but it is abundantly evident, from the vast masses\r\nof debris along the banks of the river, that the winds and rains are\r\nconstantly disintegrating the softer materials of this “MER DE PIERRES,”\r\nand carrying them down towards the stream of the Elbe, which acts its\r\npart in conveying them to the bed of the great Northern Ocean, there to\r\nform new deposits, preparatory to some other revolution in our planet,\r\nwhich may once more raise the bed of the sea into terra firma—and\r\noverwhelm our mountains and plains in unfathomable depths of the vast\r\nwatery element!\r\n\r\nVarious paths are formed among the intricacies of the rocks here, and\r\nseats formed for contemplating\r\n\r\n    “Craggs, knolls, and mounds confusedly hurl’d,\r\n    The fragments of an earlier world.”\r\n\r\nAnd few minds can dwell on such a scene without profound reflections\r\non that Almighty POWER whose operations are displayed here on such a\r\nstupendous scale.\r\n\r\nThe external or distant views from the Bastei are still more striking\r\nthan those from the fortress of Kœnigstein—more varied in their\r\ncharacter, and having Kœnigstein itself, and also Lilienstein, as most\r\nprominent features in the landscape. The rocky mounds in the same shape\r\nas the Lilienstein, which stand up in every direction, are all seats of\r\nlegendary tales, nearly as numerous as those of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nWe were not a little surprized to find in this eyrie a very comfortable\r\nhotel—the romantic situation of which has no equal in Europe, or in the\r\nworld. But we were still more astonished to find horses and carriages\r\nin the court-yard of the inn! We were, at first, inclined to disbelieve\r\nthe evidence of our own senses: but soon discovered that the northern\r\napproach to the Bastei admits of a good carriage road, so that invalids\r\nor weakly tourists may ascend to the very edge of the plateau on the\r\nsummit of the highest rock, without the slightest fatigue. Near the\r\nhotel, there is seen a gigantic excavation in the rock, five times the\r\nsize of the Coliseum in Rome, and very much in the form of a huge natural\r\namphitheatre, surrounded by a towering rocky wall, of immense height,\r\nwhich wall is crowned by a great variety of grotesque and colossal\r\nfigures, bearing more or less resemblance to animals and artificial\r\nconstructions. Here is a very loud and distinct echo, which adds to the\r\ninterest of a scene quite unique on the face of this globe.\r\n\r\nWe descended by the same path by which we ascended, enjoying the\r\nprospects from various points, and bidding adieu to the most interesting\r\nspot we had ever visited.\r\n\r\n\r\nELBE to DRESDEN.\r\n\r\nOur little gondola floated down the silver Elbe towards Dresden on\r\na beautiful day, the right bank of the river still preserving its\r\nsuperiority of scenery over the left. Indeed I think the former bank\r\nlittle, if at all, inferior to even the best parts of the Rhine—besides\r\nthe advantage of innumerable white villas, vineyards, gardens, and\r\norchards, scattered from the summit of the hills down to the water’s edge.\r\n\r\n\r\nPILLNITZ.\r\n\r\nPassing the fortified town of PIRNA a on the left, we arrived at the\r\nsummer residence of the royal family at PILLNITZ; but too late to avail\r\nourselves of the permission given to foreigners to see, from a contiguous\r\ngallery, the regal banquet at dinner-hour. The lions had not only\r\nfed, but fled—perhaps to realize our nursery estimate of the felicity\r\nattendant on crowns and sceptres—\r\n\r\n    “The KING was in his cabinet, counting out his money:\r\n    The QUEEN was in the drawing-room, eating bread and honey.”\r\n\r\nI certainly feared that the faithful adhesion of Saxony to the fortunes\r\nof Napoleon, though it saved the “galleries” and “green vaults” of\r\nDresden, had not tended to an overflow of the royal treasury—and I was\r\nquite sure that the battle of Leipsic and the Congress of Vienna had by\r\nno means enlarged the territories of the Saxon Monarch. As to the Queen,\r\nBoney’s inordinate love of _bees_ must have greatly thinned the ranks\r\nof her majesty’s hives on the sunny banks of the Elbe, and diminished\r\nthe supply of honey for the use of herself and maids of honour.[87] Be\r\nthat as it may, I sincerely hope that no _Saxon_ queen will ever be\r\nreduced from bread and honey to bread and _cheese_—for in that event, her\r\nmajesty’s case would be hopeless.\r\n\r\nWe greatly regretted that we had not a glimpse at that magnificent\r\nlioness of Pillnitz, the Princess Amelia, sister to the monarch, and\r\nPLAYWRITER to Germany in general. How she, as a Saxon princess, contrived\r\nto depict on the stage, “the domestic manners of the Germans,” as Mrs.\r\nJameson very artfully terms her dramas, is beyond my comprehension,\r\nunless she imitated the Eastern Princes of former days, who went _incog._\r\namong their subjects. Be this as it may, I confess I do not see any\r\ndelineation of character in these plays that might not be picked up in\r\nthe library, theatre, and drawing-room, by any clever girl of Princess\r\nAmelia’s calibre and talents. There is a clearer insight into domestic\r\nmanners in one of Horace’s Odes or Satires (vide Sat. VIII.,) than in the\r\nwhole of the Princess’s plays put together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe approached this city on a beautiful evening—its numerous spires\r\nand domes, its raised terraces, shaded promenades, broad river, and\r\nhandsome bridge, making a favourable impression on the stranger’s mind.\r\nThe bridge, though said to be the finest in Germany, would make a sorry\r\nfigure alongside of our Waterloo—and it bears on its centre arch a\r\nmemorial that is not likely ever to appear on any bridge that crosses\r\nthe Thames—the marks of a blow-up by a French General. The memorial,\r\nhowever, is not very complimentary to the Gallic soldiers, who performed\r\nthe exploit to prevent the allies from running—_after them_! I wish\r\nthe bridge regulation over the Elbe was enforced on all bridges, and\r\neven streets—viz. that of compelling passengers to take the right-hand\r\nside, by which they avoid jostlings or collisions. The new town, on the\r\nright bank, is the unfashionable one—the old one, the reverse—though the\r\nstreets of the latter are narrow, the houses high, and very dull as well\r\nas unadorned.\r\n\r\nYou have scarcely descended from the bridge on the left bank, when\r\nyou find yourself entangled between a palace, a church, a theatre,\r\nand a minister’s huge hotel, or rather bureau. Here I observed what I\r\nhad hitherto scouted—an “iter ad astra”—a ROYAL ROAD TO HEAVEN. From\r\nthe windows of the palace a royal arch strides across the street, and\r\nenters the Catholic church, high up, near the regal box or pew over the\r\naltar!—On the opposite side rises the theatre. Thus RELIGION sits calmly,\r\nbut proudly, between Comedy and Carousel; and the same musical corps\r\nwhich “swell the notes of praise” in the solemn anthem of morning mass,\r\nfill the air with the dulcet notes of Terpsichore, in the evening Opera.\r\nSuch easy transitions would excite some remark in holy England—though\r\nthere is nothing, after all, in these double duties of the vocal\r\ntrain—“vox et pretærea nihil.” But the sight of an English king going\r\nevery Sunday to mass would astonish his Protestant subjects. Not so in\r\nDresden. The Saxons are just as much Protestants as the British are;\r\nyet they take no umbrage at their monarch preferring the Romish to the\r\nreformed ritual!! Would that such peaceable and charitable sentiments\r\nwere universal in the world!\r\n\r\nThe palace itself is the most strange, straggling, and sombre mass or\r\nrather chaos of state prisons that ever monarch inhabited—unless it\r\nis HE of the Tartarian regions. It runs up the side of one street—down\r\nthat of another—cuts a third in two—swallows up a fourth in toto—and\r\nthen scatters itself into squares, courts, platzes, galleries, museums,\r\n&c. from which a stranger would find no small difficulty in extricating\r\nhimself, except by the aid of Ariadne’s clue, or a rope-yarn longer\r\nthan any that was ever spun by a Greenwich pensioner. No wonder that\r\ntheir majesties take their annual departure from this gloomy abode most\r\npunctually on the first day of May, to enjoy the pure air and romantic\r\nprospects of Pillnitz and the Bastei.\r\n\r\nThe picture-galleries here have procured for Dresden the title of\r\n“the FLORENCE of GERMANY.” I think the “GREEN VAULTS,” and “PORCELAIN\r\nMANUFACTORIES,” entitle it to the additional appellations of “Royal\r\nToy-shop of Saxony,” and “China-Warehouse of Europe.”\r\n\r\nAs good Protestants we first went to the cathedral—but as service was\r\nover we climbed to the summit of the dome, and there we had a most\r\ncomplete panoramic view of Dresden and the surrounding country, renewing\r\nour acquaintance with our old friends Kœnigstein and Lilienstein, which\r\nstand proudly forth as gigantic guardians of an enchanted land. The dome\r\nof the cathedral is the first spot which a stranger should visit, as it\r\nis the only place which spreads everything before him, as on a map, and\r\nall in their just proportions and distances. The city of Dresden is by\r\nno means extensive, even when including the old and new town; but the\r\nsurrounding and distant country presents scenery of great variety and\r\nbeauty. The southern views take in Saxon Switzerland—the northern, the\r\nfertile plains and vales that stretch away towards Leipzig and Berlin.\r\nIt is from this elevated position that the great field of battle between\r\nNapoleon and the allies (26th and 27th of August 1814) now smiles in\r\npeace and cultivation, instead of being bristled with cannon, and strewed\r\nwith human sacrifices at the altar of Mars. The fortifications are\r\nnow levelled to the ground, or converted into beautiful shaded walks,\r\ngardens, and groves, that lead out to meet a laughing landscape in every\r\ndirection. One, and only one, melancholy object arrests the wandering\r\neye of the delighted observer—the monument of MOREAU, on the spot\r\nwhere he fell by the side of the Emperor Alexander. A plain free-stone\r\nblock commemorates at once, the death of the “HERO MOREAU,” and the\r\nlast victory of Napoleon! From that moment, the star of this “child\r\nof destiny” began to fade in lustre, and descend from its meridian.\r\nThe battle of Culm and the disastrous defeat at Leipzig completed the\r\nliberation of Germany; whilst the struggles in France and Belgium\r\nafterwards, were only the pangs of a dying giant!\r\n\r\nIt appeared that FORTUNE had, in Napoleon’s case, determined to wipe the\r\nstain of fickleness from her character; but that she became exhausted by,\r\nor, almost ashamed of, pouring incessant favours on a man, whose talents\r\nwere as brilliant as his ambition was boundless; and whose philanthropy\r\nwas so weak that the blood of the whole human race would scarcely have\r\nsatiated his thirst of power, while the faintest hope of attaining\r\nor retaining it remained!—a man without moderation in prosperity,\r\nmagnanimity in adversity, fidelity in matrimony, philosophy in exile, or\r\nreligion in death.[88] He expired in the crater of an extinct volcano—a\r\nsuitable sepulchre for one who had grown up amid revolution, storms,\r\npolitical earthquakes, and the thunders of war. His ashes, which reposed\r\nin peace during twenty years, have been exhumed from the grave, and\r\ncast like a fire-brand upon a huge pile of the most inflammable and\r\ndestructive combustibles that were ever amassed for the explosion of\r\nanother moral volcano!\r\n\r\n    Paci funesta dies! en tristia erynnis—\r\n    Atlantiaca pulsa resurgit humo!\r\n    Ecce alias tœdas Helenæ, atque incendia Trojæ\r\n    Oceani, oceani prodita claustra vomunt!\r\n\r\nIt was for a nation like France, to demolish the altar of the living God\r\n(to use the words of Montalivert) to make room for the ashes of a Deist\r\ndead!\r\n\r\nWhile memory retraces the page of history, written in blood on the\r\nsmiling landscape beneath us, the eye rests once more on the pyramidal\r\nblock which marks the fall of one of the ablest and best children of the\r\nrevolution. Some dastard, under the cover of night, nearly effaced the\r\nword “HERO,” and substituted for it that of “TRAITOR.” Man is judged\r\nin this world by his _actions_—in the next world by his _motives_. If\r\nMOREAU warred against his country, he was a traitor—if he warred against\r\na tyrant, who usurped the sceptre and destroyed the liberties of his\r\ncountry, he was a PATRIOT.\r\n\r\nTaking a last circumspective view of the splendid prospect around us,\r\nwe descended from the dome of the cathedral, and bent our steps to the\r\nCatholic church, where high mass was about to be celebrated. Here we\r\nfound a sacred precept at once completely violated. “Whom God has joined\r\nlet no man separate.” But the wife is here severed from her husband, and\r\nthe sister from the brother—for what good purpose I am unable to divine.\r\nIf the two sexes are not allowed to pray together, lest the scandal\r\nof assignations should result, the priesthood of Saxony are as little\r\nacquainted with human nature as they are with the Aborigines of New\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\nBut what becomes of this regulation, when we see that it only extends\r\nto the PIT, while in the galleries of this holy opera (for high mass is\r\nneither more nor less than a sacred drama), the ladies and gentlemen are\r\nallowed to listen and laugh—or peradventure to pray, during the service?\r\n\r\nThe music here is said to be the best in Germany—and I suppose it must\r\nbe so. If the object of sacred music be the elevation of the soul to\r\nthe highest pitch of religious fervor and devotional enthusiasm, the\r\naccomplishment of that object may be doubted where a multiplicity of\r\nviolins and other instruments drown rather than accompany the choir and\r\nthe organ. There is, however, one exception to this doubt. When, in the\r\nperformance of the solemn _requiem_, and at the words—\r\n\r\n    Tuba, mirum spargens sonum\r\n    Per sepulchra regionum,\r\n    Coget omnes ante thronum—\r\n\r\nthe trumpet pours its loud notes along the vaulted roof of some lofty\r\ncathedral, which reverberates them on the crowd below, in imitation of\r\nthe “LAST TRUMP,” whose awful sounds shall penetrate every grave on this\r\nglobe—burst the marble cerements of the tomb—and summon their shivering\r\ntenants to the foot-stool of their God—the effect is almost magical! And\r\nwell it may be so. The very idea of such a stupendous and miraculous\r\nevent, involving the hopes and fears, the rewards and punishments, the\r\neternal peace or endless misery of the whole human race, is sufficiently\r\nastounding and overwhelming in itself; but when heightened by the most\r\nartful and gorgeous imitation that human ingenuity could invent or\r\neffect, the impression is beyond description or even conception!\r\n\r\nThe picture-galleries are the master-lion of Dresden, and as a mere\r\ncatalogue of the paintings—not a “catalogue raisonnée”—fills a goodly\r\noctavo volume, the reader may be assured that I will not, even if I\r\ncould, inflict on him a critical notice of this celebrated collection,\r\nreiterated _ad nauseam_, by so many connoisseurs in the art and mystery\r\nof the craft. Would that the pictorial critics would keep their\r\nunintelligible jargon and puzzling lingo to themselves! How many hundreds\r\nand thousands of the visitors of galleries have the cup of enjoyment\r\ndashed from their lips, while admiring paintings, by hearing some pert\r\nhypercritic condemn them as deficient in “depth of shade,” “breadth of\r\ncolour,” “truth of tint”—or some arbitrary quality which his brain has\r\nengendered to bewilder the uninitiated, and display his own refinement of\r\ntaste and judgment! Then the host of pseudo-critics, who prick up their\r\nears and catch the _fiats_ of the connoisseur, become actual pests in the\r\ngalleries, retailing the DICTA of their superiors, and scattering doubts\r\nand dissentions among the confiding crowd—\r\n\r\n            ——Spargere voces\r\n    In vulgum ambiguas.——\r\n\r\nIn such a prodigious collection the great majority of pictures must be\r\nof inferior note, and unworthy of attention. There are, however, a vast\r\nnumber of gems and chef-d’œuvres, and on these, the traveller will,\r\nalmost always, find artists (male and female) constantly employed in\r\ncopying—many of them for their daily bread—not a few, as amateurs, even\r\nof the highest rank in life. Here, then, are a series of guides, more\r\npractical than all the critics which commit their lucubrations to the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nAlthough Saxony is a Protestant _state_, it is a Catholic _kingdom_, and\r\ntherefore there is a good sprinkling of sacred subjects in the Dresden\r\ngalleries. The intentions of delineating the mysteries of our holy\r\nreligion on canvas, may be pious, but the attempt to do so is little less\r\nthan impious. What required the miraculous power of a Deity to effect,\r\nis not likely to be imitated in oil and colours by the hands of MAN. The\r\ngreat truths of RELIGION are addressed to the heart rather than to the\r\neye—to the internal feelings rather than to the external senses—to faith\r\nrather than to demonstration. Let the painter beware how he tries to\r\nreduce _these_ to sensible and visible representations!\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, the stranger will always find artists and artistes\r\nbusy in copying Bellini’s “CHRIST”—Titian’s “Tribute Money”—the same\r\npainter’s “Mistress”—Veccio’s “Virgin and Infant”—P. Veronese’s\r\n“Adoration of the Virgin and Child”—“The Finding of Moses”—Giorgione’s\r\n“Meeting of Jacob and Rachael”—“The Marriage of the Doges of Venice with\r\nthe Sea”—the “Four Doctors of the Church,” by Dosso Dossi—Raphael’s\r\n“MADONNA DE SAN SISTO,” the jewel of the gallery, which was bought\r\nfor £8000—Corregio’s “Virgin and Child”—the “Virgin and Infant in\r\nthe Manger,” the second gem of Dresden paintings,—the “Recumbent\r\nMagdalene”—“the Sacrifice of Isaac,”—“Venus and Bacchus”—Rubens’ “Descent\r\nof the Fallen Angels”—Van Dyk’s “Charles I. and Family”—Rembrandt’s “Own\r\nSelf and Wife”—Poussin’s “Discovery of Moses in the Bullrushes”—Claud’s\r\n“Acis and Galatea,” &c. These and scores of others are in perpetual\r\ntransition from the walls of the galleries to the easels of the\r\ncopyists—hence a common complaint that such collections as these give the\r\nhighest encouragement to imitators, and almost annihilate originality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN VAULTS.\r\n\r\nThis royal toy-shop—this magnificent museum of costly curiosities,\r\nmight satiate the eyes and appetites of all the Arabian princes and\r\nprincesses—of all the Persian shaws and Peruvian monarchs, that ever\r\nlived—nay, it might leave the GRAND MOGUL himself (could his court be\r\nre-established in Hindostan) nothing to wish for or want!\r\n\r\n“Whoever,” says an intelligent traveller, “takes pleasure in the glitter\r\nof precious stones—in gold and silver, wrought into all sorts of royal\r\nornaments, into every form, however grotesque, that art can give\r\nthem, _without any aim at either utility or beauty_, will stroll with\r\nsatisfaction through the apartments of this gorgeous toy-shop. They are\r\ncrowded with crowns and jewels, and regal attire of a long line of Saxon\r\nprinces;[89]—vases and other utensils seem to have been made merely as a\r\nmeans of expending gold and silver—the shelves glitter with caricatured\r\nurchins, whose bodies are often formed of huge pearls, or of egg-shells,\r\nto which are attached limbs of enamelled gold. One is dazzled by the\r\nquantity of gems and precious metals that glare around him:—he must even\r\nadmire the ingenuity which has fashioned them into so many ornaments and\r\nunmeaning nick-nacks. But there is nothing that he forgets more easily,\r\nor that deserves less to be remembered.”\r\n\r\nMr. Russell’s opinion has been cavilled at, as not giving sufficient\r\npraise to the merit of patience labour and skill that have been expended\r\non this royal collection. If these had resulted in things that were\r\neither useful or ornamental, the merit might have been granted; but\r\nneither the one nor the other has been the consequence of an expense\r\nequal to that of the national debt. The best exception to this general\r\ncensure is—“the COURT OF THE GREAT MOGUL,” representing the Emperor\r\nAURENGZEBE upon his throne, surrounded by his guards and courtiers, in\r\nappropriate costumes, according to the description of Tavernier. There\r\nare 132 figures, all of pure enamelled gold, which cost DINLINGER eight\r\nyears’ labour, and the Saxon treasury eighty-five thousand dollars! This\r\nis decidedly the most elaborate and meritorious work in the Green Vaults;\r\nbut is it more so than that which was proposed by DINOCRATES—the carving\r\nof Mount ATHOS into a statue representing Alexander? I think the latter\r\nwas the more noble of the two. The Macedonian project would have given\r\noccupation and subsistence to tens of thousands of labourers for half a\r\ncentury—the _materials_ being barren rock. The Saxon enterprize occupied\r\nonly one man for eight years—the material being pure gold, and precious\r\njewels. But as men, women and children will run after pretty baubles,\r\nglittering gewgaws, and rare curiosities—and as a tax of one shilling\r\na head is levied in the Green Vaults, a tolerable revenue is derived\r\nfrom this royal shew-shop, independent of the constant influx of wealth\r\nfrom the legions of travellers that ascend and descend the Elbe. It is\r\nbut justice to acknowledge that the curators who attend visitors around\r\nthese costly treasures, are polite and accomplished gentlemen, who speak\r\nvarious languages, and are ever ready to afford the fullest information\r\non every subject. These vaults, the picture-galleries, and armoury, &c.\r\nare open every day in the week to the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSTKAMMER.\r\n\r\nIf a tour through the Green Vaults excites reflections on the ingenuity\r\nwhich man has evinced in carving inanimate materials into the shapes\r\nand forms of various living things, an inspection of the immense\r\narmoury here, is calculated to call forth emotions of a very different\r\ndescription! Here we find the ingenuity of man exerted and tortured\r\nin the invention of innumerable deadly weapons by which his fellow\r\nman may be carved into fragments, pierced with wounds, or battered\r\ninto mummies![90] The Rustkammer certainly leaves the Tower of London\r\nat immeasurable distance in the rear, not only for the variety of\r\ninstruments used in general warfare, but for those which were employed\r\nin tilts, tournaments, and the chase. Here we see not merely the arms\r\nof the feudal ages, but the horses, the knights themselves, and all the\r\ntrappings and accoutrements thereunto belonging.\r\n\r\nThe prodigious labour and wealth expended on man, horse, armour, and\r\ntrappings, excite our astonishment rather than our admiration. The great\r\nvariety of drinking vessels, horns, goblets and cups of all dimensions,\r\nand adapted for all depths of potation, would have charmed the heart of\r\nthe Baron of Bradwardine, and, well nigh eclipsed the “BLESSED BEAR”\r\nof that hospitable old Highlander! But what shall we say to the armour\r\nof those days—for instance, that of Augustus the Second, surnamed the\r\nStrong? The French giant, who displayed his powers some years ago, at the\r\nAdelphi theatre, would hardly strut under it, weighing, as it does, more\r\nthan two hundred pounds!\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that—“were Europe thrown back, by the word of an\r\nenchanter, into the middle-ages, Saxony could take the field, with a\r\nduly equipped army, sooner than any other power. We cannot easily form\r\nany idea of the long practice which have been necessary to enable a man\r\nto wear such habiliments with comfort, much more to wield such arms with\r\nagility and dexterity. But the young officers of those days wore armour\r\nalmost as soon as they could walk, and transmigrated regularly from one\r\niron shell into another, more unwieldy than its predecessor, till they\r\nreached the full stature of knighthood, and played at broad-sword, _with\r\nthe weight of a twelve-pounder on their backs_, as lightly as a lady\r\nbears a chaplet of silken flowers on her head in a quadrille.”\r\n\r\nThe “_twelve-pounder_” on the back is a pretty considerable bounce, far\r\noutstripping Jonathan’s sea-serpent, since a “twelve-pounder” would\r\nweigh at least fifteen hundred pounds! But let that pass. No discipline\r\nor early tuition would enable a person of the present day to fight in\r\nthe armour of the middle-ages. It would require a series of generations\r\ntrained in the habits, diet, and manners of those times, to produce\r\na progeny capable of enduring such coats of mail, or wielding such\r\nHerculean weapons as were in use seven hundred years ago. The present age\r\ndoes not yield to that of any former period, in heroic deeds or personal\r\ncourage; but science now supersedes brute force, and the energies of the\r\nbrain amply compensate for diminution of muscular strength.[91]\r\n\r\nAs there is but one step from the sublime to the ridiculous—from solemn\r\ntragedy to laughing farce—so are there only a few paces between the\r\ngreat magazine of toys in the green vaults, and the great magazine\r\nof manslaughter in the Rustkammer. From these depôts we turn away,\r\nmore in pity than in admiration, to repositories of a very different\r\nkind—those of the peaceful arts, that mingle with, and contribute to, our\r\ndomestic comforts and social enjoyments, and which combine elegance with\r\nornament, and utility with beauty. Need I allude to the Saxon porcelaine,\r\ncelebrated over Europe and the world.\r\n\r\nI own that I entertained a secret hope that the number of _other_ lions\r\nin this city would drive _this_ particular one out of the memory of my\r\nbetter-half. I had three reasons for this hope or wish:—1st, the saving\r\nof expense—2d, of carriage and breakage—3d, of—smuggling! But I had\r\ncalculated without my host. Just when we had come to the conclusion, that\r\nwe had now seen all the sights, it was suddenly recollected that the\r\nbest of all was happily yet in reserve—the porcelaine manufactory! No.\r\nYou may as well attempt to drag a lady from Geneva without purchasing\r\ntrinkets, as from Dresden without buying China. A compact, however, was\r\nsigned, that we were only to enjoy the luxury of viewing the repository,\r\nwithout encumbering our luggage with any of its precious but brittle\r\nwares. Nevertheless, it happened that some of the articles were found to\r\nbe so “dog cheap,” and so pretty withall, that, to leave the Elbe without\r\ntaking away some specimens of its renowned manufactures, was considered\r\nto be a kind of travelling solecism, if not a porcelaine suicide! It was\r\nurged, moreover, that the _ad valorem_ duty, at an English Custom-house,\r\nwould be—next to _nothing_. I strongly suspect that this prophecy, like\r\nmany others, tended to fulfill itself, and that the _duty_ was, as\r\npredicted, next to _nothing_!\r\n\r\nWe had been bored, for some days, by the Laquais de Place, to make an\r\nexcursion to a place called Tharand, about ten miles from Dresden, a\r\nlocality which was represented as the ne plus ultra of all that is\r\nsublime and beautiful in natural scenery—and moreover, that it was\r\nvisited by every traveller who passed through Dresden. So we posted off\r\none fine morning, and arrived at this valley of Rasselas. We found it\r\nsituated where three narrow and steep defiles meet at one point, and\r\nwhere the ruins of an old castle, perched on a sharp promontory, overlook\r\na small village on one side, a watering-place on the other, and the road\r\nto Dresden in front. The locality has nothing of the sublime, little\r\nof the beautiful, and less of the romantic in its composition. It is a\r\npicturesque spot, but not worth the trouble of going three miles to see\r\nit. The lacquais de place will always endeavour to eke out an additional\r\nday’s boar hunting, when lionizing is at an end.\r\n\r\nOf the Dresdenese themselves, it is “not my hint to speak.” They are like\r\nmost other people under similar latitudes, institutions, and governments.\r\nLike most continental folks, they are fond of sitting in the open air,\r\nsmoking their pipes and sipping their coffee. And no wonder. The air of\r\nthe Bruhl Terrace, raised above the Elbe, and commanding a fine view\r\nof the opposite bank, as it stretches away towards Saxon Switzerland,\r\ncontrasts wonderfully with the stagnant atmosphere and gloomy apartments\r\nof their own houses. The demolition of the fortifications round Dresden\r\nhas given such lungs to the Saxon metropolis as must greatly increase the\r\nlongevity of its inhabitants—contrary to what is likely to occur to the\r\n“heroes of the barricades,” who will now be barricaded, with a vengeance!\r\n\r\nSaxony being a favourite pupil of the “Grande Nation,” the “glorious days\r\nof July” were rehearsed on the banks of the Elbe, and a representative\r\nconstitution was extorted, without much force, from the king. The\r\nconversion of one archon (mon-arch) into three hundred archons elected by\r\nthe people, and forming the “tiers etat,” or house of representatives,\r\ndid not realize the golden dreams of the country. On the contrary, as the\r\nodious task of levying taxes was shifted from the shoulders of the king,\r\nwho was always economical, to be divided among 300 representatives, the\r\nlatter body nearly doubled the taxes, being now mere tools of the court!\r\n\r\nHowever, the Saxons have obtained important privileges, and great\r\nextension of the franchise. Among other valuable rights acquired, by\r\nthe people, is that of _electing their executioner_! This interesting\r\nfunctionary is considered a kind of gentleman—at least he is an officer\r\nof state, which is next thing to it—and has a house, land, and several\r\nperquisites attached to the office. Among these last is a claim to the\r\nbodies of all horses and cattle that die a natural death. This revenue\r\nfrom hoofs, horns, and hides, is said to be very considerable. It would\r\nbe equally amusing and edifying to hear the professions and promises of\r\nthe candidate for _headsman_[92] delivered from the hustings, during the\r\ncanvass. One of the promises or temptations held out by this “limb of the\r\nlaw”—this “_sharp_ practitioner”—this member of the _executive_—would,\r\ndoubtless, be that, should any of his constituents honour him with their\r\ncustom, he would be happy to _serve_ them, on the shortest notice, on the\r\nmost liberal terms, and with the utmost _dispatch_!\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESDEN to LEIPZIG.\r\n\r\n    Swift as CAMILLA scours along the plain—\r\n    So darts on iron wings the thundering TRAIN.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine possesses the all but miraculous power of contracting\r\nspace and expanding time. Thus, it compresses the sixty-two miles between\r\nDresden and Leipzig into fifteen miles—while it enables a three hours’\r\nrun by rail to throw off an expansion of ten spare hours to see the\r\ngreat emporium of books on the banks of the Estler, which hours would\r\notherwise be spent in traversing the most monotonous road that ever man\r\nor beast drew their weary limbs along! Corn, corn, nothing but corn, or\r\nthe bare stubble from which it was cut, meets the tired eye between the\r\ncity of the pallet and the city of the pen. We become as sick, indeed,\r\nof wheat and oats, as the unwashed artisan of Birmingham is of the laws\r\nthat confine these oceans of grain to the banks of the Elbe and the\r\nVistula, instead of being diffused through the factories and work-shops\r\nof England—to appease the hunger and invigorate the limbs of a dense and\r\nmanufacturing population. The rapidity of the train, the clanking of\r\nthe machinery, the belching of steam, the evolution of smoke, and the\r\nscattering of burning cinders, render the three hours’ journey bearable\r\nenough. There is but one long tunnel, (between Dresden and Magdeburg)\r\nthrough which the train runs and roars and spits its fires—while at\r\nanother place, it leaps clean over the river Elbe! A rail-road in the\r\nNorth of Germany is quite an oasis in the desert. One hundred and forty\r\nmiles from Dresden to Magdeburg, with Leipzig in the centre, occupy only\r\nseven or eight hours, instead of three or four toilsome days by the\r\nsnail-post.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEIPZIG.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving had a good deal—perhaps too much—to do with books, I had some\r\ncuriosity to see this great mart of BUCKHANDLUNGS—at once the cradle and\r\nthe grave of literature! The first thing that strikes the stranger is\r\nthe eternal “BUCKHANDLUNG” over every second door in the city. The next,\r\nis the paucity of carriages—a drowsky or a private vehicle being rarely\r\nvisible. The third object is perpetually reminding us, not without sighs\r\nand groans, of the smooth trottoirs over which we were wont to glide in\r\nmodern Babylon. Of all the towns through which I have limped and hobbled\r\nin my journey of life, Leipzig bears the palm for maiming and laming\r\nthe unfortunate visitor, by means of its sharp stones and uneven pavée.\r\nI wonder that the seven-leagued and iron-shod boots of the students,\r\ntogether with the innumerable tomes of _heavy literature_ that are\r\nbiennially carted through the streets of Leipzig, have not ground off the\r\nangles from the said stones. Yet they have not.\r\n\r\nAs I was unwilling to do the penance of Peter Pindar’s pilgrim, I\r\ndirected my steps to the observatory, and mounted its highest balcony,\r\nwhen Leipzig and its contiguous battle-field lay stretched beneath me.\r\nThe astronomer kindly pointed out the topography of the city and its\r\nvicinity, with minute details of the great combat which he himself\r\nhad witnessed. Leipzig is a curious compound of the modern and the\r\nantique—one side being new and the other old. But in every street,\r\nbustle and business went on, while on every countenance thought and\r\nreflection were so visibly painted that one would suppose the whole of\r\nthe books that came to the two fairs were studied by the inhabitants.\r\nThe demolition of the fortifications has secured the Leipzigers two\r\nthings—the presence of healthful walks, and the absence of bloody\r\nsieges—blessings and curses which the Parisians seem neither to desire\r\nnor dread. Cities should never be converted into fortresses. The extent\r\nof the works and the number of the people are causes of weakness and\r\nnot strength. A fortress should only contain soldiers, who can lay in\r\nprovisions against long investment, and on whom, not on citizens, the\r\nhorrors of war should fall.\r\n\r\nI have said that this city is the cradle of literature. No\r\nbiblio-parturient author in Germany would think of being confined, and\r\ndelivered of his bantling of the brain, without the aid of a Leipzig\r\naccoucheur. Whether his cerebro-gestation may have lasted nine months,\r\nor, as Horace directs—as many years—\r\n\r\n    “Nonum prematur in annum,”\r\n\r\nMr. Brockhaus, or some of his obstetrical brethren in Leipzig, must usher\r\nthe “NOUVEAU NÉ” into light.\r\n\r\nBut I have also said that Leipzig is the grave as well as the cradle of\r\nliterature, or rather of its authors. At every fair there is a number of\r\nfairies on the look out for every promising birth, which is immediately\r\nkidnapped—wrested from its lawful parents—and sold in distant markets!\r\nIn other words:—whenever a work of merit, or apparent merit, appears in\r\nthe Leipzig fair, it is pounced upon by literary sharks and vultures from\r\nFrankfort, Wirtemburg, and other places, and instantly reprinted for the\r\nbenefit of those who have gone to no outlay in brains or money! It is in\r\nvain that authors and publishers complain. The _former_ are told that,\r\nalthough they have pocketed nothing by their long literary toil, they\r\nhave earned reputation, which is greatly superior to sordid gold; while\r\nthe publishers are laughed at for their foolish speculations! Hence it\r\nis, that authors of the most splendid talents and universal renown, are\r\noften forced to publish by subscription—a mode that would damn, or at\r\nleast, degrade them in the eyes of a British public. It may be said that—\r\n\r\n    “All partial ill is universal good,”\r\n\r\nand that, though authors and booksellers are defrauded, the public are\r\ngainers. But private industry is as deserving of protection as private\r\nproperty—and there can be no doubt that many men of great talent and\r\nlearning are discouraged by these piracies, and deterred from embarking\r\nin literary labours. This uncertainty too prevents all liberal outlay on\r\npaper and type, both of which are disgracefully bad in Germany.\r\n\r\nLeipzig is not without interesting associations and reminiscences. But\r\nsome of the historical are too remote—some too recent—to be dwelt on\r\nhere. The poetical are too extravagant—and the literary too mystified\r\nfor much notice in this place. Yet we cannot bid adieu to this cradle\r\nand grave of literature, without a passing thought on two of its\r\nmagnates—Gottsched and Klopstock—the _former_, the father of modern\r\nGerman learning—the _latter_, the Goliath of the same. Gottsched was born\r\nto be a great man—for his stature was such that he abandoned, through\r\npure modesty, his native land, and took refuge in Leipzig, lest he should\r\nbe promoted to the rank of a grenadier in the army of Frederick the\r\nGreat. There he claimed the character of an universal genius, acting,\r\nat once, the philosopher, grammarian, critic and poet. But his body was\r\nbigger than his brains, and he is now consigned to oblivion—perhaps\r\nunjustly so. His language then (1740-60) was just emerging from\r\nbarbarism. It was a period of transition, and shewed no signs of\r\nvigorous life. “He introduced a more cultivated style—attacked pedantic\r\nextremes—and excited useful controversy.”\r\n\r\nPassing over Schlegel, Gellert, and other literary lions of Leipzig, we\r\nmust bear in mind that it was from this mart of learning that the great\r\nKlopstock, like a huge gymnatus electricus, caused Europe to vibrate by\r\nthe birth of his Messiah. “It roused all Germany from Leipzig to its\r\ncircumference; and Bodmer, from the valleys of Switzerland, hailed its\r\nauthor as the morning-star of a new æra.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRETROSPECTIVE VIEW FROM THE TOWER OF THE OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nHe must be a stoic, or something more, who can stand on this time-worn\r\ntower, without recalling to mind those stupendous events which occurred\r\na quarter of a century ago, around the base of the building. No event,\r\nancient or modern, can at all compare with the battles around Leipzig,\r\nin Oct. 1814: whether we look to the magnitude of the armies—the\r\ndiscipline, valour, and enthusiasm of the men—the talents and skill\r\nof the commanders—or the momentous object for which they fought. Six\r\ncrowned heads—three Emperors and three Kings—were present at these\r\nterrific conflicts, and witnessed the carnage and havoc among FIVE\r\nHUNDRED THOUSAND soldiers engaged for several days and nights in mortal\r\ncombat!! This was not the undisciplined rabble, or the effeminate retinue\r\nof an Oriental despot, crossing the Hellespont in pride and ignorance;\r\nbut veterans from every country between the mountains of Norway and the\r\nmouths of the Danube—between the Atlantic on the West and Siberia in\r\nthe East. These battles were not for mere victory, or to decide some\r\npolitical quarrel between two or more states. No. It was for the very\r\nexistence of sceptres—for the independence or subjugation of every empire\r\nand kingdom in Continental Europe. The struggle was between the oppressor\r\nand the oppressed—between Napoleon the aggressor, and the allied\r\nSovereigns, as defenders of their crowns, hearths, and altars. The one\r\narmy had the disgrace of a hundred defeats to obliterate and avenge—the\r\nother the laurels of a hundred victories to preserve and sustain. The\r\nFrench fought for the glory of their country, or rather of their Emperor,\r\nand the conquest of Europe—the Allies, for the liberation of their soil\r\nfrom thraldom, and the repulsion, if not the deposition, of a tyrant\r\ninvader.\r\n\r\nSuch a prodigious accumulation and concentration of martial\r\nhosts,—excited, agitated, and impelled by the fiercer passions of our\r\nnature—by ambition, hatred, and revenge—portended the approach of some\r\ngreat crisis in the affairs of the world. The feeling on both sides was,\r\nevidently, “aut Cæsar aut nullus.” The grand crisis was indeed at hand.\r\nThe benignant STAR of Peace and Justice was about to rise, in splendour,\r\nfrom the East;—while the malignant METEOR OF WAR, that had scattered, for\r\ntwenty years, plague, pestilence and famine over a groaning world, was\r\nabout to descend from its bad eminence, and be extinguished for ever in\r\nthe Atlantic surge.\r\n\r\nNapoleon, with all his strength of mind, was superstitious; having some\r\npeculiar notions about fate, and destiny, and stars and fortune—as though\r\nthese imaginary beings had any power to control the laws of Nature, or\r\ninterfere between cause and effect, whether in the moral or physical\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that, when, in the night of the 15th October,\r\nNapoleon saw three “DEATH-ROCKETS” rise from the southern horizon,\r\nstreaming their pale but brilliant light high through the Heavens—and,\r\nwhen, immediately afterwards, he beheld four blood-red meteors springing\r\nup far far to the northward, indicating too plainly that the signal\r\nfrom the grand Austro-Russian army in the South was answered by the\r\nSwedo-Prussian in the North, his moral courage may have experienced a\r\nmomentary depression, and his superstition an alarm! There was little\r\ntime, however, for reflection. Action, action was soon required. At the\r\ndawn of day the Austro-Russian army attacked the whole southern front\r\nof the French position with great fury but no success. Six desperate\r\nattempts were reiterated, one after the other—but all failed! This was\r\ndiscouraging enough—worse remained behind. The moment of exhaustion among\r\nthe allied troops was seized upon by Napoleon, who, by one gigantic\r\neffort, pierced and penetrated the very centre of the allied line, while\r\nMurat, Maubourg, and Kellerman, dashed through the gap with the whole\r\nof the cavalry! At this moment of frightful peril, when the torrent of\r\nFrench troops was pouring through the fatal breach with irresistible\r\nimpetuosity, shouting and exulting in the successful exploit, ALEXANDER\r\ncalled to his faithful Cossack guards, and pointing to the column of\r\nFrench cavalry that was thundering forward in the rear of the allies,\r\naddressed a few, and but a few words to them—probably not dissimilar from\r\nthose of our own poet, at another terrific combat—\r\n\r\n                    ——on ye brave,\r\n    Who rush to glory or the grave—\r\n    Wave, Cossacks! all your banners wave!\r\n      And charge with all your chivalry!\r\n\r\nThe valorous Pulk right well fulfilled the emperor’s order. The “furious\r\nHuns” sprang, like tigers, on the “fiery Franks,” and not only charged\r\nand checked the headlong torrent, but rolled back the dense mass of\r\ncavalry at the point of their spears, with destructive carnage, through\r\nthe opening by which it had penetrated the Austro-Russian line. Thus,\r\nat the moment when all appeared lost for the allies, a handful of\r\nsemi-savages from the banks of the Don overwhelmed the finest body of\r\nFrench horse that ever paraded on the banks of the Seine—and that with\r\nthe King of Naples at its head!\r\n\r\nAfter this rebuff, the fickle goddess forsook her favourite child! The\r\nassailing armies hemmed in, closer and closer, the contracting circles of\r\nNapoleon’s troops, and after days of ineffectual struggles to revive a\r\nsinking cause, the hero of a hundred victories was obliged to sue for an\r\narmistice! No answer being returned, the mortified emperor prepared for\r\nretreat. But even here Fortune turned her back on him. The Saxon troops\r\nthrew off their allegiance, and even fired on their former companions in\r\narms, while endeavouring to extricate themselves from the western gate\r\nof Leipzig! The only bridge, too, by which they could escape, was blown\r\nup by mistake, while twenty-five thousand Frenchmen were left prisoners\r\non the other side! Napoleon with difficulty reached the western bank of\r\nthe Estler—Poniatouski was drowned in that muddy ditch—and a mere wreck\r\nof the Gallic army reached the Rhine. From that day, the star of Napoleon\r\ndescended till its light was quenched for ever in the western wave! Of\r\nall the auxiliaries and mercenaries which various passions, propensities,\r\nnecessities, or interests had attracted round the standard of the\r\nvictorious emperor, ONE ONLY remained true to its trust in the memorable\r\nretreat from Leipzig! Italians, Bavarians, Saxons, Swedes—\r\n\r\n    “All, all forsook the friendless guilty mind,\r\n    But faithful Poland lingered still behind.”\r\n\r\nIt may not require any great fortitude to meet the scowl or scorn of\r\nour enemy, whether conqueror or conquered; but he must have nerves of\r\niron who can look in the face of _friend betrayed_. The sight of the\r\ngallant and deceived Poles, bearing nobly the hardships and miseries of\r\na disastrous flight, might have wrung tears of remorse from Napoleon’s\r\neyes. But he had no heart. Egotism was the nutriment on which even his\r\nambition fed. What said he, when viewing the wretched remains of his army\r\nwhen it halted at Erfurt, on the 23d of October? “_They are a set of\r\nscoundrels, who are going to the devil._” Retributive justice ordained\r\nthat HE HIMSELF should not be far behind them!\r\n\r\nThe Tower of the Observatory stands close to the Estler and the scene of\r\nthe dreadful evacuation of the town, the death of Poniatouski, and the\r\nblowing up of the bridge. It also commands a view of most of the theatres\r\nof operations during the successive battles, besides an excellent\r\nbird’s-eye view of the town itself. No one should fail to visit this\r\nspot, and recall the mighty events which occurred around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGDEBURG to HAMBURG.\r\n\r\nA good railroad whisks us along, through monotonous corn-fields, from\r\nLeipzig to Magdeburg, in three or four hours. This is the strongest\r\nfortification (always excepting Kœnigstein) on the Elbe—and contains more\r\nthan fifty-thousand people, garrison and all. It is, or rather _was_,\r\nin Saxony; but, thanks to the auspices of Napoleon, in favour of his\r\npet of Dresden, it is now Prussian, and likely to be long so. It is of\r\nimmense extent, and would require thirty or forty thousand men to defend\r\nit—consequently double that number to invest it. As all great virtues\r\nare assailed by virulent abuse, so all strong cities are honoured with\r\nlong sieges. The history of Magdeburg should be printed and posted on the\r\ngates of Paris. It has had its ups and downs in its day. It was besieged\r\nmany a time, and sometimes taken. Although it repulsed the famous Count\r\nWallenstein, in the thirty years’ war, it fell, after two years’ siege,\r\nbefore the magnanimous Tilley (1631), who sacked the city; but in his\r\nhumanity, spared the whole of the inhabitants—except THIRTY THOUSAND,\r\nwhom he massacred, without distinction of age or sex!! These are among\r\nthe “splendid miseries” to which fortified towns and cities have been\r\nentitled, time immemorial—from the days of Alexander and TITUS, to those\r\nof Napoleon and Wellington—from the sacred heights of Solyma, to the\r\nsandy plains of Haerlem! This doubtful glory—this dangerous pre-eminence,\r\nappears to be the height of a great people’s ambition—though it is\r\nprobable that a nation’s strength has more in its moral courage and\r\nphysical energies, than in dead walls and deep ditches.\r\n\r\nA steamer starts at five o’clock every morning from Magdeburg to Hamburg,\r\nand when the Elbe is not very low, the passage may be performed in one\r\nday. But fortunately, or unfortunately, we had not had a wet day, or\r\nhardly a cloud in the sky, from the day we left London, till our return\r\nto that metropolis, and therefore the river was so shallow, that we were\r\nforty-eight hours on the voyage. There never was a vessel that had a\r\ngreater partiality for the ground than ours—and when once her keel and\r\nthe sand came in contact, it was as difficult to separate them as to\r\ndisengage two furious mastiffs joined in mortal combat. Our captain, too,\r\nhad a singular method of loosening his vessel from her hold on the shoal.\r\nInstead of carrying out an anchor astern, and dragging her off in that\r\ndirection, as we drag dogs from one another by their tails, he invariably\r\ntook the anchor out a-head, and after prizing the vessel as far forward\r\non the bank as possible, he then tried the retrogressive plan, and, of\r\ncourse, succeeded, though sometimes after two or three hours’ delay. At\r\nlength we came to a dead stop—for there was not three feet water in any\r\npart of the river; so we were obliged to shift into another steamer,\r\n“_below bar_” and jogged along, as above the barrier, but more of our\r\ntime passed aground than afloat. However, we had a very pleasant society\r\non board—people from various countries—very good table-d’hôte—but, as\r\nthe weather was fine, and the berths close and crowded, I picked out the\r\nsoftest plank I could find on deck, and slept in the open air, during our\r\ndescent of the Elbe. There is little or no improvement of the scenery\r\nbetween Dresden and the mouth of the river. The Elbe pays a heavy fine\r\nin the shape of monotony for its short but romantic route through Saxon\r\nSwitzerland!\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMBURG.\r\n\r\nFrom the muddy wharves and quays, we scramble up through steep streets,\r\nevery second house having an inscription, or rather an advertisement in\r\nEnglish on its walls or over the door Of the Babel tongues that salute\r\nthe ear in every part of this city, the English seems to hold the next\r\nrank to German and Dutch. Whether it was from the lowness of the Elbe,\r\nand the long drought, I know not, but the canals that penetrate far\r\nup several of the streets, appeared abominably filthy and malodorous.\r\nThree-fourths indeed of their bottoms were bare of water, and only\r\nexhibited reeking mud, well impregnated with all kinds of animal and\r\nvegetable debris, and admirably calculated to spread pestilential\r\ndisorders through the city.\r\n\r\nAt length we got to what might be termed “the West End,” though it is\r\nhere the North or North-East quarter, and the scene is entirely changed.\r\nWe find ourselves, all at once, on the borders of a spacious lake, which\r\nis narrowed in the middle, and spanned there by a bridge, exhibiting on\r\nits surface numerous pleasure-boats, and on its banks a succession of\r\nhandsome buildings. Shaded walks and terraces are constructed along the\r\nshores, so that these lakes (for they may be considered as two formed\r\nby a bridge) really present a most refreshing picture to the eye in\r\nSummer, and furnish a magnificent skating-plain in Winter. The levelled\r\nfortifications are now converted into superb and extensive promenades,\r\ngardens, and shrubberies, exhibiting a pleasing contrast to the endless\r\nbatteries, fosses, and bastions of Magdeburg and other fortified towns.\r\nNo city or town on the Continent, that I have seen, presents anything\r\nlike the BUSTLE of BUSINESS that is going forward in every street of\r\nHamburg. Leipzig is nothing to it, since it wants all the elements and\r\nmateriel of maritime commerce. The great hotels face the lake (which, by\r\nthe bye, is a monstrous dam formed by a dribbling stream, the Alster)\r\nand the _Salles-a-Manger_ there, shew us that we are almost clean out\r\nof Germany, and nearly in the heart of old England. The table-d’hôte\r\nis at four o’clock, where good substantial joints and dishes dance\r\nmerrily round the table, and are eagerly demolished by stomachs sharply\r\nwhetted on the exchange, the bureaus, warehouses, and shops of this most\r\nsingular entrepôt of European merchandize; The Hamburghers and Leipzigers\r\nappear to belong to the class of ruminating animals, who flock to the\r\ntable-d’hôte for the purpose of swallowing, or rather bolting their\r\ndinners, dispensing entirely with the process of mastication, and leaving\r\nthe triple functions of rumination, digestion, and calculation to go on\r\nsimultaneously, not successively, by which many hours of valuable time\r\nare daily gained for the dispatch of business. I will not maintain that\r\nthis bolting system, followed by the hard labour of two important organs,\r\nthe head and the stomach, at one and the same time, is equally as well\r\ncalculated for the preservation of health as for the accumulation of\r\nwealth; but probably it is not more insalubrious than the ennui, the\r\ninertion, the eternal pipe, and the poisonous dishes of the noncommercial\r\nGermans in general.\r\n\r\nIt is upon the same principle of economy of time, and division of labour,\r\nthat the Hamburghers hire professed mourners to weep and wail over their\r\ndeceased relatives. By this ingenious procedure the business of the\r\nliving is not interrupted by the departure of the dead—perhaps not even\r\non—\r\n\r\n    The first dull day of nothingness—\r\n    The last of suffering and distress!\r\n\r\nWhen the Hamburghers levelled their fortifications to the ground, they\r\ntook care to leave certain portals or barriers standing, by which\r\nthey might be enabled to levy contributions on—“the stranger within\r\ntheir gates,” as well as on those who are outside. The nocturnal tax\r\non ingress and egress increases with every hour after sunset, and the\r\nbustle and confusion occasioned by the embarkations and debarkations\r\nof steam-travellers with their luggage, baffle all description. The\r\ndrowskies and their cads, the porters and their wads, the janitors,\r\nthe police, and the watermen—all jumbled in the darkness of the night\r\nabout the water-gate of the city—all vociferating in the most discordant\r\njargon; but all united in the strictest harmony of action, as to one\r\noperation—the patriotic endeavour to empty the passengers’ purses of\r\nevery stray mark that might be encumbering their pockets—such a scene is\r\nnot easily delineated, nor will it be forgotten!\r\n\r\nA good steamer, fair weather, and a pleasant company, rendered a\r\nforty-eight hours’ run to modern Babylon an agreeable variety in the\r\nchequered scenes of a long tour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTIC TRAITS OF GERMANY AND THE GERMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now brought my various perambulations (at various times) through\r\nGermany to a close, it might be thought possible that a traveller could\r\nform some definite idea—or draw some distinctive character of the\r\npeople themselves. This is more easy in theory than in practice. If\r\nan intelligent Japanese were conveyed through the air to Connaught or\r\nKerry, and dropped there for a month, to observe the manners, habits, and\r\ncharacter of the inhabitants:—if he were thence deposited in Yorkshire,\r\nfor an equal time—then among the mountains of Wales—and finally in the\r\nHighlands of Scotland: and if, after all this, “he returned to the place\r\nfrom whence he came,” and was asked for some characteristic sketch of the\r\nBritish nation, he would be not a little puzzled. In the first place, he\r\nwould assert that he had visited four nations, differing as much from\r\neach other as the shamrock differs from the rose, or the thistle from\r\nthe leek. They differed in appearance, language, dress, manners, diet,\r\ndrink, avocations—soil—climate—and, for aught he knew, in religious\r\ncreeds. If pressed for some one characteristic common to all, he might be\r\ntempted to reply that the only one thing in which they all agreed was—_to\r\neat potatoes_. However varied were the other component parts of their\r\nfood, they all _ate potatoes_. Now if, within the narrow boundary of the\r\nBritish Isles, we find such diversity among their inhabitants, what may\r\nwe expect in that huge democracy of autocracies that stretches from the\r\nBaltic to the Adriatic—from the banks of the Rhine to the confines of the\r\nRuss—which extends over a surface of fifty thousand square miles—bears a\r\npopulation of 38 millions of souls—and, what is still more remarkable,\r\nsustains a weight of 38 sovereignties, of all shapes and sizes, from\r\nImperial Austria, of 12,000 square miles, down to the principality of\r\nLichtenstein, covering the enormous area of ten or eleven! Throughout\r\nthese vast and varied territories, there is diffused all the varieties\r\nof physical organization, moral temperament, and intellectual capacity,\r\ncharacteristic of the great European family. And yet there is a certain\r\ndegree of family likeness in these 38 sovereignties, that can hardly be\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n                ——Facies non omnibus una,\r\n    Nec diversa tamen.——\r\n\r\n1. _Physiognomy._—The large head, the square face, the blue eyes, the\r\nhonest countenance, the solemn gait, the modest mein, and the punctilious\r\nmanners of the German, are everywhere conspicuous.\r\n\r\n2. _The Language._—This, it must be confessed, is grating enough to\r\nthe ear; but it is far more disagreeable to the eye! When will Germany\r\ndiscard that barbarous, or at least Gothic system of hieroglyphics,\r\nby which bad paper is disfigured by worse type! There is something so\r\nsingular, not to say startling, in the German language, that if a mummy\r\nwho had slept in one of the Pyramids since the days of Sesostris were to\r\nawake among a mixed company of antiquarian unrollers, the German tongue\r\nwould surely be the first to tickle its withered ears.\r\n\r\n3. _Ideology._—The Germans are great dreamers—magnificent dreamers. The\r\nItalian may imagine, the Frenchmen invent, the Spaniard may ruminate,\r\nand the Dutchman may calculate; but it is the German who can DREAM while\r\nwide awake. A German will dream you a dream, as long (to use a nautical\r\nphrase) as the main-top-bow-line; or rather as an epic poem, and as full\r\nof reality as the latter.\r\n\r\n4. If the four British races were unanimous only in one thing—the eating\r\nof potatoes;—the 38 sovereignties beat them in this respect. All ranks\r\nand classes smoke tobacco—and both sexes devour sour-krout, grease, and\r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n5. The PATIENCE of the German is proverbial. He is patient in\r\npolitics, affliction, adversity—and, what is still more commendable,\r\nin _prosperity_. Hence he wins and loses at the gaming-table with more\r\nequanimity than any other man.\r\n\r\n6. In RELIGION, Germany presents nearly as many creeds as principalities.\r\nThese, however, shoot forth from the Reformed Church. Popery is too\r\npoor a soil for the growth of “heresies and schisms.” It will not bear\r\na plurality of faiths. If Catholicism be not the true belief, we must\r\nadmit that Catholics are the true believers. Of all the deviations from\r\nthe Protestant Church in Germany, _Rationalism_ and _Scepticism_ are\r\nthe most prominent and dangerous. Speaking of the latter, Dr. Hawkins\r\nobserves:—“We must anticipate, however reluctantly, that, not only\r\nin Germany, but in some other parts of Europe, the heaviest calamity\r\nimpending over the whole fabric of society is the lengthening stride of\r\nbold Scepticism.” And, after describing the tenets of the RATIONISTS, the\r\nsame authority remarks:—“They consequently disclose to us the frightful\r\nfact, that all the essential doctrines of Christianity are unreservedly\r\nrejected.” A question might here be asked: is this widespreading state of\r\nno belief—of no religion—preferable to Catholicism, mixed up with a few\r\nsuperstitions and errors?\r\n\r\nWe hear constant complaints that Popery is on the increase. How can it\r\nbe otherwise? Where and when was UNION not a source of strength, and\r\nDIVISION of weakness? The Protestant _High_ Church is like a brilliant\r\nmeteor shooting through the air in splendour and brightness; but\r\nconstantly detaching from its own body some vital elements of its own\r\nexistence. The Catholic Church, on the other hand, is like a snow-ball\r\nrolling along the ground, with apparent humility, a dense and cohesive\r\nmass, alike tenacious of that which it possesses, and attractive of that\r\nwhich falls in its way.[93]\r\n\r\n7. _Affability._—I have before remarked, and it is remarked by all\r\ntravellers, that, in no part of Europe or the world, are affability,\r\namenity, and suavity of manners, in social intercourse, more conspicuous\r\namong all classes, orders, genera, and species of society, than in\r\nGermany; or a more complete absence of all prominent or repulsive\r\ndistinction of ranks. I endeavoured to account for this by education,\r\nhabit, and example. But there is one other cause adduced by Dr. Hawkins,\r\nwhich I overlooked—the numerous sovereignties and states into which\r\nGermany is divided, the very inter-collisions of which tend to preserve\r\na smoother surface, and a greater equilibrium of urbanity, than under\r\none great monarchy, or even republic. I shall attempt to illustrate this\r\nmoral phenomenon by a physical one. Let us take two small and tranquil\r\nlakes, one to represent England, and the other Germany. Let a large stone\r\nbe dropped into the centre of the _former_, and we shall quickly observe\r\na series of waves or undulations, rolling in excentric circles to the\r\nremotest edges of the water, in every direction—all parallel, all close\r\nto each other, but never touching or mingling. This exactly represents\r\nthe gradations of rank, classes, professions, and avocations in England.\r\nThey diverge from the central monarchy in parallel lines down to the\r\npeasant—always in close approximation; but never touching or amalgamating.\r\n\r\nInto the other lake, let 38 stones, of various shapes and sizes\r\n(corresponding with the 38 sovereignties) be precipitated in as many\r\ndifferent parts of the glassy mirror. What shall we see? Not the series\r\nof distinct waves rolling from centre to circumference—but a chequered\r\nsurface where one undulation is broken, crossed, or neutralized by\r\nanother, and where large or definite circles of waves are nowhere\r\nperceptible. The application of this simile to German society requires no\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n8. _Education._—It is acknowledged that, in no other country is education\r\nso cheaply and amply provided as in Germany. It is remarked by Dr.\r\nHawkins, that the _results_ of education in Germany and in England,\r\nare very different. In the _former_, the student is almost entirely\r\nengrossed by the physical and practical sciences—whilst the English\r\none is very much occupied with theology, morality, classics, poetry,\r\nand rhetoric. “Yet in the end, the Englishman becomes most practical,\r\nand the German the most theoretical and sentimental.” With all due\r\ndeference to Dr. Hawkins, I doubt or rather deny the fact, that the\r\npractical _education_ of the German renders him theoretical: or that the\r\ntheoretical _education_ of the Englishman makes him practical. Will Dr.\r\nH. maintain that a good education in the physical and practical sciences\r\nwould convert an Englishman into a theorist or sentimentalist? No, it\r\nwould not. It is not the education, but the different circumstances\r\nin which the two people are placed, after leaving the schools, that\r\nproduce the contrast noticed by Dr. Hawkins. A complaint is made that\r\nthis facility of education leads to surplus candidates for professional\r\nhonours; and the German governments endeavour to divert the aspirants\r\ninto other channels than the learned professions. But where is there\r\n_not_ this surplus? In England, where education is expensive enough, the\r\nranks of the church, bar, and medicine, are crowded to suffocation. Two\r\ncauses of this operate in Germany. The cheapness of education—and the\r\ncheapness of living afterwards.—Two or three in England—the redundancy of\r\npopulation, and the choaking up of the war-channels, those waste-pipes\r\nand safety-valves of society. To these may be added the restless ambition\r\nof the shopocracy to push some of their sons into the carriage from\r\nbehind the counter.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the English consider that education (among the\r\nlower classes) without a particular creed, is worse than no education\r\nat all. The real, though not the acknowledged meaning of this is, that\r\neducation, or knowledge, is, in the abstract, or _per se_, an evil rather\r\nthan a good. It would be much better to openly and candidly maintain this\r\ndoctrine at once, than mystify it under the term “religious instruction,”\r\nthat is, instruction combined with a _particular_ creed. An ingenious\r\ncasuist might easily shew—perhaps prove—the truth of the anti-education\r\ndoctrine. Beginning with the Garden of Eden, he might quote Scripture\r\nthat knowledge first\r\n\r\n    “Brought death into this world, and all our woe.”\r\n\r\nAnd descending along the stream of time, he might adduce proofs that,\r\nin exact proportion as nations advanced in knowledge, they became\r\ndiscontented, refractory, immoral, and irreligious. But though it is\r\nmaintained by the High Church party in England, that a particular creed,\r\nwithout knowledge, is preferable to knowledge without a particular\r\ncreed; yet it is confessed that the _latter_ is not always an infallible\r\ncorrector of the evil inherent in learning. We too often find sin and\r\nscience in those academic bowers where the thirty-nine Articles are\r\nregularly inculcated, and implicitly believed.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, in Germany, reading, writing, and arithmetic—Greek,\r\nLatin, and mathematics—astronomy, geography, and navigation—anatomy,\r\nphysic, and surgery, &c. &c. are taught in public seminaries without\r\nreference to any other creed than that of the general truth of\r\nChristianity as contained in the New Testament.\r\n\r\nSome few particulars of the system of education in Prussia, may not be\r\nuninteresting.\r\n\r\nEvery department has a board of education, which employs\r\nschool-inspectors, residing in the chief towns. Every circle and parish\r\nhas also its school-board—and every school its proper inspectors. The\r\nclergyman of the parish is, _ex officio_, one of the inspectors. The\r\nwhole system is under the cognizance and control of the Minister of\r\nPUBLIC INSTRUCTION, assisted by a Council. The seminaries are divided\r\ninto—1. Elementary or Primary Schools—2, Burgher, or Middle Schools—3,\r\nUniversities.\r\n\r\nParents unable to prove that they can give their children a competent\r\neducation at home, are compelled to send them to school at the age of\r\nfive years. Masters are obliged to give their servants and apprentices a\r\nsuitable education between the seventh and fourteenth year. No child can\r\nbe removed from the school till examined by the inspectors. Poor parents\r\nare furnished with the means of sending their children to school. The\r\nschools are supported by endowments—tax upon property—and contributions\r\nfrom the affluent. The schools are built in healthy places, with\r\nplaygrounds, gymnasiums, &c. “The first law of every school is to train\r\nup the young so as to implant in their minds a knowledge of the relation\r\nof man to God—and to excite them to govern their lives according to the\r\nspirit and precepts of Christianity.” The daily occupations begin and end\r\nwith a short prayer and some pious reflections. The New Testament shall\r\nbe given to those who can read. The more advanced scholars shall have the\r\nBible. “This book shall also be used for the religious instruction in\r\nall the classes of gymnasiums (or middle schools.)” “Clergymen are to\r\nseize every opportunity, whether at church or on visits of inspection, of\r\nreminding teachers of their high and holy mission, and the scholars of\r\ntheir duty towards the public instructors.” There are numerous “normal\r\nschools” for training up schoolmasters. Of all the children in Prussia,\r\nbetween the age of seven and fourteen years, it is calculated that\r\nthirteen out of every fifteen, are educated in the national schools.\r\n\r\n9. _Learning._—That depth of erudition should be a necessary sequence of\r\ncheap education may admit of question, or, at least of cavil; but one\r\nthing is certain, that, whether as a _post hoc_, or a _propter hoc_,\r\nthis article is more abundant in Germany than in any other country.\r\nGermany is, in fact, the great European granary of learning—a granary\r\nsadly infested with rats and mice from poorer soils—whole shoals of these\r\nvermin being seen crossing the Rhine annually, with all the voracity\r\nevinced by their forefathers, when in pursuit of the Bishop of Maintz!\r\n\r\nBut Germany is also a vast MINERY, where thousands are digging in the\r\ndark, during the best years of their lives, extracting the most precious\r\nliterary lore from the masses of rubbish in which it lies concealed.\r\nAround the mouths of these mines are always hovering certain birds of\r\nprey, of passage, and of furtive propensities, which, under cover of the\r\nnight, commit depredations on the shining ore that is rescued from its\r\ngrave by the laborious miner. Among these are the literary cormorant,\r\nthe gull, the daw, and the magpie, who no sooner get _crammed_ with the\r\nGerman spoils, than they fly off to their roosts and nests to exhibit\r\nthem as the legitimate produce of their own industry. I have known more\r\nthan one, two, or three of these daws who, having plumed themselves in\r\nGerman feathers, strutted as proudly as if their habiliments had been of\r\ngenuine indigenous growth!\r\n\r\nThe German seems to court, and to cultivate LEARNING for the sake of\r\nitself, rather than of its attendant advantages. He climbs the rugged\r\nsteeps of science—wanders over the flowery fields of literature—or\r\nexplores the dark and mysterious labyrinths of metaphysics—with little\r\nhope, and less prospect of reaping more than empty fame,—and that too\r\noften posthumous! Yet the German is as modest in the profession, as he is\r\nindustrious in the pursuit of knowledge. In his patient researches, he is\r\nhardly ever led aside to the right or to the left, by ambition, vanity,\r\nor avarice. Truth is his object—accuracy, impartiality, and laborious\r\nresearch, are the channels through which he reaches it. Not that he is\r\ninsensible to honours of all kinds. On the contrary, like the whole of\r\nhis countrymen, a ribbon, a cross, or a star, is to him not only a symbol\r\nof distinction but an object of worship.\r\n\r\nThe German illuminati, whether literary, philosophic, or scientific,\r\nimmersed in their libraries and laboratories, far removed from the\r\nexcitement of politics, commerce, arts, or manufactures, not seldom lean\r\nto the speculative, rather than to the practical—to the mysterious,\r\nrather than to the obvious.—Hence the transcendental dreams and\r\nextravagant experiments, which daily rise, like meteors, from this land\r\nof ideality and metaphysics, soon to dissolve in air—thin air. Yet these\r\neccentricities are not attributable to peculiarity of education, or\r\nidiosyncrasy of constitution; but to those extrinsic circumstances in\r\nwhich the German is placed.\r\n\r\n10. _The Press._—The freedom with which this powerful engine is wielded\r\nin the different states of Germany, varies very much. Between Vienna\r\nand Leipzig-liberty of the press, there is nearly as much difference\r\nas between Negro freedom in Virginia and London. But the censorship\r\nexists everywhere. The manuscript of volume, magazine, or newspaper must\r\nfirst undergo the revisal of the phlegmatic and inexorable CENSOR, who\r\nstrikes out or alters every passage or paragraph which has any tendency\r\nto exercise the imagination, excite the feelings, or appeal to the\r\npassions. This at least, is the policy of Austria. Now it would require\r\nbut little ingenuity to prove—or at least, persuade, that this is the\r\nvery _ne plus ultra_ of good government. What engines are so potent\r\nin the origination and propagation of evil as imagination, feeling,\r\npassion? How praiseworthy is it in the Austrian Emperor to stifle and\r\nsuppress all combustible materials of this kind!—How beneficial would the\r\nCensorship prove in England! Take, for instance, the subject of LIBEL—so\r\nwell calculated to introduce all kinds of hatred and ill-will amongst\r\nBritons. The AGE or the SATIRIST might, without the possibility of\r\n_prevention_, assert that “the QUEEN was—anything but a gentlewoman:”—and\r\nthat “the Chancellor of the Exchequer was lately _detected in picking the\r\npocket_ of one of his neighbours on the treasury bench!!” Now if such\r\nparagraphs came before an Austrian Censor, that redoubtable OFFICIAL\r\nwould either erase them entirely and cite the audacious editor before one\r\nof the tribunals, or substitute something like the following:—“From all\r\nparts of the country congratulatory addresses are pouring in upon her\r\nMAJESTY, in consequence of the recent happy event.” And in respect to the\r\nalleged PICK-POCKET, it would probably run thus:—“The recent financial\r\nmeasure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the imposition of a tax on\r\nrent-gatherers), has given universal satisfaction to all classes of the\r\ncommunity—with the exception, perhaps, of Daniel O’Connel, M.P., who\r\nopposed the measure so stoutly in parliament.”\r\n\r\nBut the _prevention_ of all sources of excitement and irritation\r\namongst the community, so much preferable to the _punishment_ of them\r\nafterwards, would not be the only advantage of a shackled, that is, a\r\ncensored PRESS. The great majority of writers, who, being defective\r\nin imagination, feeling, and passion—in other words, of GENIUS—are\r\nnow consigned to oblivion, would, under the paternal Austrian system,\r\nspring up in myriads, and greatly tend to render the Plumbean rule of\r\nauthority a veritable wand of Mercury, soothing the great mass of\r\nsociety into soporific torpor, and silencing effectually those turbulent\r\nspirits of the age, who stir up men’s minds to mischief! Away then with\r\nthose hot-headed enthusiasts who prefer a “LIBERTAS PERICULOSA” to the\r\nAustro-patriarchal system of “SERVITUDO QUIETA,” where the fiat of the\r\nsovereign is the fate of the subject!!\r\n\r\nThen think of the incalculable benefit that would accrue to society from\r\nthe suppression of those myriads of critical and political reviewers,\r\ntrimestral, mestral, hebdomadal, and diurnal, who batten and fatten on\r\nthe vitals of authors, scattering their quivering members to the winds,\r\nor flinging them about, like firebrands, to inflame the passions of the\r\ncommunity! In fine, till PRINCES muzzle the press, there will be no\r\nmillennium between them and their PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n11. _Domestic Manners._—A treatise on the _domestic_ manners of the\r\nFrench and Germans, is like an essay on the rail-roads of the Alps in the\r\ndays of Hannibal—or steam-navigation in the voyage of Nearchus—or the\r\nmariner’s compass in the Periplus of Hanno. Let us hear the testimony of\r\none who resided long in Germany, and was intimate with their habits and\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n“The Germans are not so domestic as the English, yet perhaps more so\r\nthan the French. The taste of the _middle and lower classes_ carries\r\nthem necessarily to public gardens, coffee-houses, the table-d’hôte,\r\nand the theatre. A large portion of the male population dine daily\r\nat the table-d’hôte, and here a considerable portion of their time\r\nis dissipated. The _higher orders_, in addition to the theatre,\r\nderive one of their chief gratifications from a Summer visit to some\r\nof the mineral springs; and here they live all together in a family\r\nmanner—entire families at these bathe dine and sup, and even breakfast in\r\npublic.”—_Bisset Hawkins._\r\n\r\nIt is really no paradox, therefore, to say that an insight into\r\n_domestic_ manners in Germany, will be best acquired in _public_—where\r\nall classes, high, middle, and lower orders “live and move and have their\r\nbeing!”\r\n\r\n12. _Women._—Perhaps in no country of Europe (as indeed the preceding\r\nsection would indicate) are the barriers around female honour more feebly\r\nraised, or less vigilantly guarded;—yet in no country is female virtue\r\nmore free from stain. “Here the temperament of woman is cast in a happy\r\nmould. Gentle, kind, unambitious, unaffected, she is less intent upon\r\nadorning herself, than in administering to the happiness of those around\r\nher. She is fenced round with few artificial restraints; and, in society,\r\nshe often meets with too much laxity of opinion and usage. Her full and\r\nconfiding heart requires a helpmate on whom to lean through life. This\r\nsupport granted to her, she generally exhibits all the domestic virtues\r\nin their vernal bloom.”\r\n\r\nTo this it has been objected that, the number of children born out of\r\nwedlock in Germany, is infinitely greater than in England. Thus, in the\r\ngreat city of Prague, more than a third of the children born annually are\r\nillegitimate. But mistresses may be virtuous without being married—and\r\nthey may be married without being virtuous. In many countries marriage\r\nis only a civil, and not a religious rite. The neglect of that ceremony,\r\ntherefore, _in such countries_, involves neither sin, nor crime, nor\r\ndisgrace. The slender _liaison_ of affection is often stronger and more\r\ndurable than the massive chains of matrimony. The frequency of these\r\n_liaisons_, therefore, is to be attributed to the influence of public\r\nsentiment, rather than to depravity of the female heart. The facilities,\r\nindeed, of effecting divorce in many Protestant States of Germany\r\nrender the tie of marriage little more than a nominal bond that can be\r\nconveniently cancelled, when passions cool, tempers clash, or interests\r\npredominate!\r\n\r\n13. _Morality._—Although there can scarcely be genuine RELIGION without\r\nmorality; yet there may be great display of MORALITY without religion.\r\nGermany affords a proof and illustration. In no other country is there\r\nless of RELIGION—in none is there less of CRIME. The apparent paradox\r\nis easily solved. Crime is punishable by the laws of man, in this\r\nworld;—irreligion is punishable by the laws of God, in another. In a\r\ncountry where little or no religion prevails, and consequently where\r\nthere is little or no belief in future rewards and punishments, it\r\nmay readily be supposed that the fear of the magistrate is much more\r\nefficient than the fear of the Lord.\r\n\r\n14. _Socialism._—Smoking is not so sociable an affair in Faderland\r\nas in some other countries. In this respect, indulgence in tobacco\r\npresents a great contrast to that in tea. If you visit a cigar divan\r\nin London, or an estaminet in Paris, you will find “the flow of soul,”\r\nif not the “feast of reason,” in conjunction with the fumes of the\r\n“cursed weed.” Not so beyond the Rhine. The German shrinks within the\r\ncloudy atmosphere of his pipe, like a snail within its shell, and there\r\nremains imperturbable, immoveable, and insensible to the external\r\nworld. Meanwhile the soul retires to some remote nook or corner of the\r\nbrain—probably the pineal gland—and there taking its metaphysical siesta,\r\ndreams of all imaginable and unimaginable things! This appears to be the\r\nreal explanation of the idealism, mysticism, and transcendentalism of the\r\nGerman character.\r\n\r\n15. TIME.—By half the world or more—by all who have much to do, whether\r\nby the head, the hands, or the feet—TIME is regarded next to health,\r\nas the most valuable article: by the other half—or a large portion of\r\nit—TIME is looked upon as little better than a drug, and readily bartered\r\naway for the merest trifles!—Nay, it is often voted to be a great\r\nBORE, and a thousand ways and means are invented to kill the bore. In\r\nGermany TIME is not over-rated, on the one hand, nor despised or hated,\r\non the other. All Germans have something to do (for who is without his\r\npipe), and few have very much work on hand. The German, therefore,\r\ntakes everything leisurely and coolly—never permitting himself to be\r\nhurried or flurried—even by the sound of the dinner-bell, or the march\r\nto the table-d’hôte. It is seldom of any use to bribe the waiter or the\r\npostillion to increased velocity. The cook and the horses not being\r\nparticipators of the _douceur_, are not at all inclined to assist in the\r\ncompletion of the implied contract between the other parties. The German\r\nnever attempts to “KILL TIME,” well knowing that in such a conflict the\r\nenemy must be ultimately victorious. But he daily and hourly offers him a\r\n_narcotic_, by which his scythe may be blunted, and his ravages obscured.\r\n\r\nOf all the mythological divinities, TIME is most familiar to us, through\r\nthe medium of his works:—for he himself is invisible, inaudible,\r\nintangible. TIME is cloathed, on one side, with flesh and blood:—the\r\nother is a naked skeleton. In his right hand he holds a wand, by which\r\nhe calls into existence, every instant, countless myriads of beings\r\nthroughout the animal and vegetable world—leading them forward to\r\nmaturity and age. His skeleton hand is clenched on a crooked falchion,\r\nwith which he smites, destroys, and annihilates everything which he had\r\npreviously created—thus realizing the fabled monster that eternally\r\ndevours its own progeny![94] It is a melancholy spectacle—but it could\r\nnot have been otherwise! It is possible that the Almighty could have\r\ncreated a single pair immortal—but the power of multiplying could not\r\nhave been conferred without the penalty of death!\r\n\r\nTyrannical, inexorable, and pitiless, as he is, yet TIME is not without\r\nsome redeeming qualities. 1mo. He is strictly _impartial_. He slackens\r\nnot his pace at the command of the monarch—he hurries not his steps\r\nat the prayer of the slave. 2do. TIME mitigates every _moral_ ill\r\nthat is unattended with culpability or remorse: and although he too\r\noften aggravates _physical_ maladies, yet he invariably diminishes\r\nour sensibility to pain, and thus tends to reconcile us to our lot of\r\nsuffering. 3tio. He is sure to remove from the sphere of their operations\r\nall tyrants, oppressors, and evil-doers; thus giving the world a chance\r\nof better successors. 4to. TIME is a great enemy to personal beauty,\r\nof feature or form—apparently deeming such qualities to be dangerous\r\naccompaniments to length of years. On the other hand, he is more\r\nfavourable to virtue, honour, morality, and RELIGION, of which TIME\r\n_alone_ never deprives the individual till the curtain falls.\r\n\r\nOn TIME PAST, hallowed in memory and mellowed by distance, we look back\r\nas on an old and valued friend, whom we did not sufficiently appreciate\r\nwhile living, but who is now lost to us for ever.\r\n\r\nTIME PRESENT we too often contemplate through the haze of prejudice,\r\npassion, or impatience; underrating his value, overlooking his flight,\r\nand neglecting the advantages which he offers, till, all at once, we find\r\nthat TIME PRESENT has changed into TIME PAST, and vanished from our grasp!\r\n\r\nTIME TO COME—is that fairy-land of promise—of air-built castles—of\r\nhopes that are seldom to be realized, of fears that are generally\r\nexaggerated—of phantoms, good and evil, conjured up by imagination on the\r\ndim horizon of our mental vision, which dissolve as we approach, or fly\r\nas we follow!! Yet these phantoms of futurity form the solace and the\r\nmisery of half the world!\r\n\r\n16. _Titles, Decorations, &c._—From the savage, with the ring in his\r\nnose—the serjeant, with the tassel on his shoulder—the prince, with the\r\nstar on his breast—up to the monarch, with the diadem on his brow—all and\r\nevery of the human race, are nearly insatiable in the pursuit of honours,\r\ntitles, distinctions, or decorations. I do not presume to determine what\r\nnation or people most _desire_ these pomps and vanities; but I think it\r\nwill be allowed that the Germans are not behind their neighbours in the\r\n_display_ of them. The French may dispute the palm on this point; but I\r\ndoubt whether they will gain the victory. JOHN BULL appears to be the\r\nleast ostentatious of the European family, often pocketing his stars and\r\ngarters, when travelling, by which he saves in money what he loses in\r\neclat.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this weakness of the German and Frenchman is very pardonable.\r\nThose who have _fairly_ earned honours are under no obligation to conceal\r\nthem; and those who have not done so, are not called upon to proclaim the\r\nsecret—especially as so many of their friends and neighbours are always\r\nready to kindly perform that office gratuitously.\r\n\r\n17. _Aerophobia._—From one end of Germany to the other, among all\r\nages, ranks, and professions, an _AEROPHOBIA_, or dread of fresh air,\r\nuniversally prevails! If you take a seat in the diligence or eilwagen,\r\nyour German neighbour in the corner closes the windows immediately, lest\r\na breath of pure air should enter the vehicle. On arriving at the hotel,\r\nhalf poisoned by the disoxygenated atmosphere of the coach, and enter\r\nyour chamber, you find all the windows securely fastened, and the air of\r\nthe apartment a mass of heavy mephitic vapour, like that which issues\r\nfrom a long unopened tomb. If you descend to the spies-saal, where the\r\nair is still farther vitiated by the fumes of tobacco, and throw open a\r\nwindow, you are stared at by the ober-kellner, the under-kellner, and\r\nevery “GAST” in the “HAUS,” as a person deranged. I had long puzzled my\r\nbrains to account for this aerophobic phenomenon, and, at last, traced\r\nits cause to the GERMAN STOVE—that black brewery of mephitism, which,\r\nbearing a mortal antipathy to the fresh air of Heaven, imbues every one\r\nwho sits near it with the same prejudice. In fine, the German exhibits as\r\ngreat a horror of oxygen, as he does a mania for azote!\r\n\r\nAnd what is the consequence of this?—Why, that the Germans are ten times\r\nmore susceptible of colds, rheumatism, face-aches, and tooth-aches,\r\nthan the English, who live in a far more variable, wet, and ungenial\r\nclimate. This aerophobia is one of the causes too, of that sallow,\r\nunhealthy aspect which all Germans, who are not forced to be much in the\r\nopen air, exhibit. It is no wonder that they swarm like locusts round\r\ntheir numberless spas, in the Summer, to wash away some of those peccant\r\nhumours engendered by their diet, and fermented by their stoves.\r\n\r\n18. _Female Peasantry._—Among a barbarous people, we always find that\r\nthe weaker sex have the harder work. It is not very flattering nor yet\r\ncreditable to the pride of civilization, that in many parts of Europe,\r\nand even in Germany, the female peasant is little more than a beast of\r\nburthen, with worse food and more care than the ox or the horse. Wherever\r\nwe see three persons employed in agricultural labour, two of them are\r\nsure to be women. They cut the corn, and thrash out the grain—dig the\r\npotatoes, and carry them home—whilst the large baskets on their backs\r\nare filled with everything that requires transportation from the fields\r\nto the house, or from the house to the fields. One of the most revolting\r\ninstances of this female slavery which I have seen, was in Belgium,\r\nwhere, on the line of the railway, we observed women sitting with large\r\npanniers on their backs, into which the men were shovelling the earth,\r\ngravel, and stones, to be carried away by the females—many of them young\r\nwomen! Every time that the earth or gravel was thrown into the pannier,\r\nthe shock caused a violent vibration of the whole female frame, from head\r\nto foot! The sight was really disgusting.\r\n\r\nIn travelling through many parts of Germany we are often surprised at the\r\npaucity of men, and cannot help wondering where they are, or what they\r\nare doing! Women are the universal drudges here!\r\n\r\n19. _Status quo._—Among all ranks and classes of Society in Germany,\r\nfrom the prince to the peasant, there is, or there _appears_ to be, a\r\ncomplete amalgamation, approximation—in fine, an _equalization_ in one\r\nthing—POLITENESS. But the approximation goes no farther than the hat, the\r\ncap, and the bow. It would be almost as easy for a Pariar in India, or a\r\nLadrone in China to break the boundaries of his cast, and rise through\r\nthe ranks above him, as for a German of low grade to mount into the\r\ncircles of the nobility. Each ascending series is all but hermetically\r\nsealed against the inferior one! What is impossible to be done, is not\r\ntherefore attempted—perhaps it is scarcely desired. All this is reversed\r\nin England. Here we have but very little reciprocity of external and\r\nformal civility among the different ranks; but the barriers between them\r\nare to easily—or at least so frequently overleaped, that almost every\r\nindividual has an ardent wish, and is engaged in a constant struggle to\r\nrise above the grade in which Nature or accident placed him at birth.\r\nIt is evident that this contrasted state of things, quite independent\r\nof politics, must produce tranquillity, if not content, in the one\r\ncountry—commotion and even strife in the other. At the same time it\r\ngenerates industry, energy, and enterprize in England.\r\n\r\n20. _Locomotion._—It is passing strange that the mercurial brains of our\r\nFrench neighbours should never have infused any quicksilver into the\r\nheels of their horses! No. There they go at the old jog-trot of five\r\nmiles an hour, over the “long rough road,” which seems as if it had\r\nbeen stretched out over hill and dale, by some invisible and gigantic\r\napparatus, into a straight and narrow line, which is as tiresome to the\r\neye of the traveller as it is to the limbs of the horses. In plodding\r\nGermany, however, we do not expect velocity in man or beast—or that the\r\nschnell-post should go at any other rate than the snail’s pace. In that\r\ncountry time and space seem to be confounded or amalgamated;—a league\r\nsignifying an hour, and an hour a league, the word “STUNDE” (derived no\r\ndoubt from “_stand_”) being applicable to either or both.\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons, indeed, for the tardiprogression of a German\r\nvehicle, independently of the breed and the build of those animals that\r\ndraw it along. _First._ The German never does anything in a hurry. He has\r\nmore time on his hands than any other man. His days are longer—his nights\r\nare longer (though his beds are shorter) than those of an Englishman. Why\r\nthen should he hurry over the pleasant journey, or curtail the salutary\r\nrange of travelling exercise?—_Secondly._ A German’s luggage is twice\r\nthe size and weight of an Englishman’s, besides the huge crate in which\r\nit is stowed above or behind the carriage. _Thirdly._ There is an outlay\r\nof time, labour, and expense in frequently cleaning the harness of the\r\nhorses—the body, the wheels, or the leather of a carriage. This outlay is\r\nprudently avoided by the German, who trusts to the winds and rains for\r\ndisencumbering his harness and eilwagen of some layers of those weighty\r\nand numerous incrustations that have slowly formed on their surface.\r\n_Fourthly._ There are no Collinge’s patent axletrees in Germany, which\r\nwill hold oil for a month; and although the post-master charges some\r\nkreutzers for “grease” at every station, small is the portion of that\r\nlubricating article which reaches the hot and creaking gudgeons of the\r\nponderous locomotive!\r\n\r\nBut the primary and fundamental cause of tardiprogression in Germany may\r\nbe traced to the roads themselves, which, though much improved in many\r\nplaces, are still villainously bad, and require the hardest and heaviest\r\nwood and iron to withstand the tremendous succussions which the vehicle\r\nis destined to experience at every step. Besides, as the German chaussée\r\nmarches straight forward over hill and dale, without deigning to wind\r\nround the one, in order to evade the other, so the SCHNELL-POST must\r\nnecessarily go at a snail’s pace to the end of the chapter—or, at all\r\nevents, to the end of the journey.\r\n\r\n21. _The Burschen._—Perhaps no country, except Germany, _could_ generate,\r\nor _would_ tolerate a large class of the rising generation—students by\r\nprofession, but demi-ruffians by habit—who are organized in clubs, and\r\nbanded in clans, for no other purpose but the violation of all law,\r\norder, decency, and morality! The supreme felicity of the Burschen\r\nis to swill beer, smoke tobacco, and fight duels. If they submit one\r\nhour in the twenty-four to the rule of the professor, they rule him,\r\nand tyrannize over others during the remainder of the day. Most of\r\nthe hours that can be spared from duelling, fencing, and dancing, are\r\ndedicated to what they term “_renowning_”—that is, of working all kinds\r\nof mischief—enacting all sorts of absurdities—attracting everybody’s\r\nattention—and earning every one’s contempt and detestation. The evening\r\nand much of the night are spent in the ale-house, where the summit of the\r\nBurschen’s ambition is, who can drink most beer, smoke most tobacco—and\r\nvociferate with the loudest voice—\r\n\r\n    “Though wine, it is true, be a rarity here.\r\n    We’ll be jolly as gods with tobacco and beer.\r\n                “Vivallerallerallera.”\r\n\r\nWhile bellowing about liberty, justice, honour, and truth, the Burschen\r\nwill tyrannize over others with the most despotic sway—break the sword of\r\njustice over the victim’s head—trample on the laws of honour—and violate\r\nthe sacred truth!\r\n\r\n“Full of lofty unintelligible notions of his own importance—misled by\r\nludicrously erroneous ideas of honour—the true BURSCHE swaggers and\r\nrenowns, choleric raw and overbearing. He measures his own honour by\r\nthe number of _scandals_ (duels) he has fought; but never wastes a\r\nthought on what they have been fought for. He does not fight to resent\r\ninsolence; but he insults, or takes offence, that he may have a pretext\r\nfor fighting. The lecture-rooms are but secondary to the fencing-school.\r\n_That_ is his temple—the rapier is his god—and the “COMMENT” (the\r\nBurschen laws) is the Gospel by which he swears.”[95]\r\n\r\nSuch is the BURSCHEN, or collegiate youth of Germany. The fraternity\r\nitself is called the “LANDSMANNSCHAFTEN”—a confederation of various clans\r\nfor the double purpose of fighting among themselves, and defending\r\nthe corps against the Philistines, as the rest of the world is called!\r\nFortunately for society, this odious freemasonry which is forced on\r\nthe student at first, is dropped with the cap, long hair, uncouth\r\ncoat, and Jack-boots, the moment he bids adieu to Alma Mater—and he\r\nsettles down among his brethren the PHILISTINES, discharged from the\r\nLANDSMANNSCHAFTEN, like an old soldier from the army, with nothing\r\nbut honorable(?) scars to remind him of the days of “renowning” and\r\n“scandalizing,” in Gottingen, Jena, Leipzig, or Heidelburg. It is said,\r\nbut I doubt the assertion, that this three years’ training in habits the\r\nmost objectionable, seldom, if ever, exerts any influence on the citizen\r\nin after-life—and that he becomes as peaceable, civil, and obedient\r\nto the laws, as those who had never set foot within the walls of a\r\nuniversity.\r\n\r\nBe this AS IT may, it becomes a serious question whether initiation into\r\nthe Eleusinian mysteries and eccentric, not to say barbarous, habits of\r\nthe Burschen, be conducive to the welfare of British youth? The effects\r\nof English universities are not always thrown off with the cap and gown!\r\nLet parents ponder on the LANDSMANNSCHAFTEN.\r\n\r\n22. _German Cookery._—I am not going into a disquisition on continental\r\ncookery in general, nor on German in particular. Man has been\r\ncharacterized as a “COOKING ANIMAL,” and if refinement in this noble art\r\nand science be a proof of civilization, our Gallic and Saxon neighbours\r\nmust stand unrivalled. The New Zealander, who roasts his hog, his dog,\r\nand his prisoner in the same oven, sinks very low on the gastronomic\r\nscale—not on account of his canine or cannibal predilections, but\r\nbecause he cannot so mystify and transform the original materials of his\r\nlaboratory—the genera and species of his animal and vegetable stock—as to\r\ndefy Orfila himself to ascertain whether they had been inhabitants of the\r\nair, the earth, or the “waters under the earth.” As I think I have made\r\na small discovery that may prove of some importance in the cuisine of my\r\nnative land, I shall here communicate it, _pro bono publico_.\r\n\r\nIn almost all the cities, towns, and even villages of Germany, we find\r\non the bill of fare certain dishes that are great favourites with JOHN\r\nBULL—namely, beef-steaks—mutton-chops—veal cutlets—pork-chops—lamb-chops,\r\n&c. To be sure the titles are not very easily pronounced; but the kind\r\nhost is always ready to furnish you with rind-fleisch, schwein-fleisch,\r\nlamms-fleisch, kalbfleisch, or hammelfleisch, without doubt or delay.\r\nWhen these come on the table, they are so nicely browned, and crusted\r\nover with bread-crumbs, flower, butter and other mysterious compounds,\r\nthat, except by the external figure, and the protuberant rib, no\r\ndiscrimination between the different dishes could possibly be made. Nor\r\nwill the taste detect schweins-fleisch from any of the other fleshes. All\r\nagree, however, in the tenderness, flavour, and delicacy of the steaks,\r\nchops, and cutlets. Then, again, they remark, how well the fat is taken\r\noff, leaving nothing but the meat; while the bone comes out as easy\r\nand as clean as if it had been boiled and scraped in a separate vessel!\r\nThese eulogies attracted my attention, and I began to examine the chops\r\nand steaks accurately. A very slight dissection demonstrated, beyond a\r\ndoubt, that all was a composition. A few further intrusions into the\r\ncuisines explained the whole matter, without difficulty. The cold meat,\r\nof every description, is pounded in a mortar, with pepper, salt, and\r\nspices. When wanted, it is pressed into moulds (like butter) according\r\nto the shape required—an old rib or bone is thrust into one end of the\r\nchop—the whole is well covered with crumbs of bread, flour, or other\r\nhabiliments—made smoking hot in the oven—and brought to table as most\r\ndelicious mutton-chops, veal cutlets, pork-chops, beef-steaks—or—anything\r\nyou please to demand.\r\n\r\nDo I blame or criticise this ingenious manufacture? Far from it. The\r\npounded and compounded chops and steaks are better than original ones—are\r\neasy of digestion—require little or no mastication—are savoury to the\r\ntaste, and warm to the stomach—and, what is of some consequence, they\r\nare economical, and always ready for dressing at any hour of the day\r\nor night. The only part of the compound to which I object, is the\r\n_bony-part_. These bones remain in the kitchen, like heir-looms, serving\r\nfrom generation to generation, as far as I know, and if the cook takes\r\nthe trouble to wash them daily, with the spoons’ and forks, my objection\r\nvanishes at once. The above discovery explained an enigma which often\r\npuzzled me when travelling on the Continent—namely, the impossibility of\r\ngetting cold meat at a hotel—even a few hours after the most splendid\r\ntable-d’hôte.\r\n\r\nI can have no reason—or at all events no right, to question the taste of\r\nour continental neighbours in the preparation of their food. To German\r\ncookery, German spas, German baths, and German waggons, I owe the loss\r\nof fifteen pounds in weight, and that in a late tour of two months. But\r\nthen the lost flesh was London fed—and I gained in strength far more in\r\nproportion than I lost in weight. This may prove a valuable hint to the\r\nrace of aldermen, and many others besides.\r\n\r\n23. _Gallic and German Patriotism compared._—The temperature of a\r\nFrenchman’s patriotism seldom reaches the boiling, or even the fever\r\npoint, unless he is, in act or imagination, the aggressor or agitator.\r\nIt requires the fuel of pride, ambition, glory, revolution, or conquest,\r\npresent or prospective, to keep up the steam of national enthusiasm among\r\nour Gallic neighbours. Not so beyond the Rhine. A German’s patriotism\r\nrises in proportion as “FADERLAND” is borne down by misfortunes, or\r\ntrode upon by the foot of the haughty foreigner. The flame of devotion\r\nto country never burns with greater intensity in a German’s breast, than\r\nwhen it is apparently extinguished by the pressure of the victorious\r\nenemy. Both these propositions are proved by history. Every one knows\r\nthe sacrifices which the people of France made in the late war, while\r\nNapoleon was trampling on the liberties of Europe. Yet, when the tide\r\nof his glory ebbed, and the energies of Germany and other countries\r\ncarried forward the contest into the heart of France—the French nation\r\nsunk into apathy, stupor, or indifference. So, on a recent occasion,\r\nwhen the thunder of British cannon demolished the ramparts of a Syrian\r\ndespot—a vice-regal slave-driver—and reverberated from the pyramids to\r\nMontmartre, the flame of patriotism glowed in every Frenchman’s breast,\r\nfrom the Mediterranean to the Moselle—and already the MARSELLAISE hymn\r\ndepicted the EAGLES, as pluming their wings and wafting their flight over\r\nthe Alps and the Rhine—over the Tyber and the Thames! For, although the\r\nword “patriotism” means, in all other languages, the love of natal soil,\r\nyet in the French vocabulary, it signifies the love of revolution at\r\nhome, or of conquest and spoliation beyond the limits of France.[96] The\r\nwanton and threatening insult, though only prospective and intentional,\r\nwhich she lately held out to Europe, called forth a “GERMAN MARSELLAISE,”\r\ntuned to true patriotic principles, and containing no menace—no allusion\r\nto former invasions of France, and capture of her capital. The whole\r\nburthen of the song, and conclusion of each verse, breathed only the\r\nfirm resolution to resist aggression, and preserve their “Faderland”\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n    “No, never shall they have it, our free-born German Rhine,\r\n    Till deep beneath its surges, our last man’s bones recline!”\r\n\r\nGerman patriotism, in the long run, will prove superior to Gallic\r\nambition. The love of country is a nobler and safer passion than the love\r\nof conquest.[97]\r\n\r\nThe French tell us that the English are detested on the Continent—but\r\nto adduce any reason for this, would be quite unlike a Frenchman—whose\r\nassertion needs not the vulgar auxiliary of proof. The only plausible\r\ncause which he might urge for this anti-Britannic hatred, is the fact\r\nthat the English assisted the continental nations to drive the French\r\nback over the Rhine, and up to the Boulevards—hence the detestation of\r\nGermany, Russia, Spain, &c. against England! This is quite the Gallic\r\nstyle of ratiocination.\r\n\r\n24. _Prisons._—There would seem to be two, if not more, kinds of\r\nliberty—political and personal; or national and individual. They do\r\nnot always run parallel. When our Gallic neighbours placed the CAP OF\r\nLIBERTY on the head of a COURTEZAN, and worshipped her as a GODDESS, the\r\nprisons were overflowing, and most of the inmates lost their caps—in\r\nwhich their heads happened to be at the time! No one will contend that\r\nGermany is overburthened with political liberty—but I believe that the\r\nproportion of out-door to in-door prisoners there, is as great as in this\r\ncountry. To say the truth there are not many temptations to take up free\r\nquarters within the walls of a German prison—for although HOWARD, that\r\ngreat practical reformer of “proved,” that is to say, _approved_ abuses,\r\nwas there; yet the hard labour, low fare, bastinado for men, and whip\r\nfor women, afford little encouragement to transgression of the laws. To\r\nthe honour of Austria be it said, that the functionaries are strictly\r\nenjoined to apply the whip and bastinado, with all due regard to the\r\n_moral feelings_ of the prisoners, and with the most scrupulous attention\r\nto the forms and ceremonies prescribed for those occasions!\r\n\r\nIn respect to food, the following is the Austrian dietary. “The prisoner\r\nhas one pound and a half of bread _per diem_—a farinaceous dish with milk\r\nthrice a week—and on Sundays a soup, with a quarter of a pound of meat,\r\nand the farinaceous dish again.” _Hawkins._ This, it must be confessed,\r\nis meagre fare; but _half_ of what the prisoner can earn, _beyond his\r\ndaily task_, is given to him for the purchase of additional comforts.\r\n\r\nInstruction, both religious and lay, is provided by the state—consisting\r\nof reading and sometimes of arithmetic—but not _writing_, as that might\r\nlead to correspondence not entirely composed of love-letters or letters\r\nof love! It is clear, indeed, that the Emperor of Austria (though himself\r\na PAPIST) has no great faith in the dogma of a POPE—\r\n\r\n    “HEAVEN first taught _letters_ for some wretch’s aid.\r\n    Some banished lover, or some _captive maid_.”\r\n\r\nAt all events, Prince Metternich has not recommended his master to follow\r\nthe example of HEAVEN in teaching his subjects to write _letters_; nor\r\nis it likely that the veteran and wily minister will introduce a penny\r\npostage, to enable the subjects of the whip and bastinado to—\r\n\r\n    “Waft a _sigh_ from Indus to the Pole.”\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are many good points about German prison-discipline.\r\nThe classification of the prisoners—the separation of the juvenile from\r\nthe hardened offenders—the law of rendering labour the only means of\r\nprocuring anything like comfortable diet—the regularity of religious\r\ninstruction and duties—the laudable exertion of Government to reinstate\r\nthe liberated and punished prisoner in the social position previously\r\noccupied—not forgetting the humane injunction never to hurt the\r\n_feelings_ of the flogged—are all worthy of praise and imitation.\r\n\r\n25. _Beds and Bed-rooms._—A German sleeping-room presents a real\r\nparadox—beds that are at once plural and singular—plural in number, but\r\nsingular in office. One would suppose that all the men in that country\r\nwere monks, and all the women nuns. You look in vain for the large and\r\ncomfortable bed, on which John Bull and his spouse are accustomed to\r\nrepose when at home. Nothing of the kind will you see here! From the\r\nmoment that a married couple set foot on the Continent, the wife is\r\ndivorced, if not “_a mensa_” at least “_a thoro_.” I have said that the\r\nGerman beds are _singular_. They are so in every sense of the word! In\r\nother countries, they are designed to promote rest and sleep. In this\r\nthey act like strong coffee or green tea taken at ten o’clock. In a\r\nGerman bed, the two extremities of the victim are “perched up aloft,”\r\nwhile the body is “under hatches.” The only personage who can attain\r\nanything like horizontality in these cribs, is the corporation gourmand\r\nafter a good eight o’clock table-d’hôte. If he turn in, or rather turn\r\n_over_ on his face, with his feet on the taffrail, and his stomach\r\nstowed in midships, he will be able to bring his head, his spine, and\r\nhis heels into something approaching a right line. In this position he\r\nwill have the great advantage of sleeping on his supper, and thus evading\r\nthe pressure of the night-mare. When the woolsack is laid over the\r\ntraveller’s body, the whole resembles the old moon in the lap of the new.\r\n\r\nIt is very fortunate for John and Jane Bull that before they sojourn\r\nlong in Germany their travelling constitutions will have begun, like\r\nnew clothes, to suit them—and, which is of greater consequence, they\r\nwill have got rid of the most inconvenient article, by far, of their\r\nluggage—(and that is saying a good deal, when a lady’s baggage is in\r\ntransit)—namely the—idea of COMFORT—an article which even the douanier\r\nnever searches for, as being not only out of his beat, but out of his\r\nmother tongue!\r\n\r\nMany circumstances had, long ago, impressed me with a high sense of the\r\nvalue of a TRAVELLING CONSTITUTION, as a kind of Mackintosh against\r\n“skiey influences;” but none more so than an occasional glimpse at the\r\nmysteries of the laundry. If a traveller happens to forget some valuable\r\narticle at his hotel, and hastens back to his chamber about mid-day,\r\nhe will be rather surprized to find the bed-linen on the floor, nicely\r\nsprinkled with water, preparatory to a squeeze under a high-pressure\r\nengine, which renders it of a glossy smoothness, and diffuses the watery\r\nelement so equally, that it feels delightfully cool to the next—and\r\neven to the tenth tenant of the caravansera! I fear that this is often\r\nthe case nearer home, and where there is no “_travelling constitution_”\r\nto resist the vapour-bath of exhalent sheets in our foggy and cold\r\natmosphere! The contracts between masters and chamber-maids for the\r\nsupply of damp linen to hotels, are too often contracts for the supply\r\nof coughs, consumptions, and rheumatisms to travellers—greatly to the\r\nadvantage of doctors, druggists, and undertakers afterwards!\r\n\r\nTourists who can afford space for leather sheets among their luggage,\r\nshould take these useful articles with them, as there are more maladies\r\nthan colds and rheumatisms _contracted_ in caravanseras, and for which\r\nthere is no provision made in the _contract_ between host and passenger.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged, however, that, of late years considerable\r\nimprovements have taken place in the bedding line. In several parts of\r\nGermany, in the Autumn of 1840, we found very comfortable mattresses,\r\nblankets, coverlets, and sheets, to our no small joy and surprize.\r\n\r\n26. _German Stove_ versus _English Chimney_.—That a room heated by\r\ninvisible caloric—with an atmosphere stagnant as the dead sea, humid\r\nas a Scotch mist, and odoriferous as a slaughter-house—should prove\r\nmore congenial to the lungs of persons in the first or last stage of\r\nconsumption, than an apartment with a blazing fire at one end, a large\r\ncolumn of hot air rushing up the chimney, and a thousand tiny streams\r\nof cold air stealing in through the chinks and crevices of doors and\r\nwindows, I do not, for a moment, deny. But, that the general balance of\r\nsalubrity is on the side of the German stove, and against the English\r\nfire-place, I very much doubt. I admit that the air of an English room,\r\nheated by fire, is frequently changing the degree of its temperature,\r\nnot only as a whole, but in different parts of the same chamber. This is\r\nthe alpha and omega of Continental objections to the English plan—and it\r\nwould not be difficult to show that this variability of heat, so much\r\ncomplained of, is a powerful preservative against atmospheric disorders\r\nin general. Nothing is more certain than that the most effectual way of\r\ncounteracting the effects of sudden changes in the temperature of the\r\nair around us, is to _habituate_ ourselves to these vicissitudes. It is\r\nin this way, that daily sponging of the face, throat, and other exposed\r\nparts of the body, first with hot, and then immediately with cold water,\r\ngenerally prevents face-aches, ear-aches, tooth-aches, and catarrhs, by\r\nhabituating those parts to changes of temperature. And it is on this\r\nprinciple, that a person who has been for some time in an English room,\r\nwhere variations prevail, goes out into the open air afterwards, with far\r\nless risk than he who has been for an equal time in an actual sudatorium,\r\nat a high and unvarying range of temperature. But let us look a little\r\nmore closely into the affair. In the room heated by a German stove and\r\nconsequently where there cannot be a free ventilation, every individual\r\nis breathing the identical air that has circulated through the lungs of\r\nevery other individual in the same place—through the air-cells of the\r\nscrofulous, the scorbutic, the asthmatic, the consumptive, &c.—air that\r\nis not only deprived of its oxygen, but loaded with animal effluvia of\r\na very questionable character! Add to these the malodorous essence of\r\ntobacco, much of which must drip down the throat, as well as into the\r\nreceptacle below the bowl of the pipe, during the day, to be exhaled in\r\n_poisonous_ gases through the rooms at night! All must have experienced\r\nthe debilitating effects of disoxygenated air in crowded rooms, even\r\nwhere there were various facilities of ingress and egress for the breath\r\nof Heaven. But where these facilities are wanting, the depression of the\r\nvital energies is indescribable. In short, I am of opinion that nothing\r\ncan compensate for the ventilation produced by the English chimney.\r\nThose who stand or sit near a partially opened door, or a broken pane of\r\nglass, may catch cold, or face-ache, or rheumatism, it is true; but if I\r\nam to die or to suffer from atmospheric influence, let me do so in pure,\r\nrather than in mephitic air!\r\n\r\nI have grounded these reasonings on salubrity alone—leaving _comfort_\r\nout of the question—as indeed it must be round the German stove! Why,\r\nthe very sight of a cheerful fire in a Winter evening, is worth a German\r\nstove with the table-d’hôte thrown into the bargain! In a good fire we\r\nhave company, conversation, and even meditation. I do not wonder that the\r\nPersees adore fire, as an emanation from the sun itself. I much doubt\r\nwhether the Egyptians would have worshipped a German stove, even when\r\nthey were so over-godly as to deify cats and crocodiles! But, to give\r\nthe devil his due, the German stove is not without some good qualities.\r\nIt is cheap—it does not set fire to ladies’ dresses—nor cause chilblains\r\nby scorching the fingers and toes in frosty weather. But as a drawback\r\nupon these negative good qualities, it renders the Germans a race of\r\nhot-house plants, who shiver in the blast whenever they issue from their\r\nvapour-baths, and are infinitely more liable to take cold than if they\r\nhad come from an English room.\r\n\r\nThe introduction into this country of the ANGLO-GERMANIC stove—that\r\nunsightly and unsocial laboratory of sulphur and suffocation—will not, I\r\nthink, succeed. It is bad enough in Germany, where the Dutch tiles with\r\nwhich it is covered, emit no bad smell, and have a comparatively light\r\nand cheerful appearance; but here the hybrid iron mass—that dark lantern,\r\n“cui lumen ademptum”—is positively a nuisance. It may be borne, and even\r\nprove useful, in large halls, where there are constant currents of cool\r\nair. In a sitting-room or other chamber, it is very offensive—at least\r\nto my senses, from its metallic and sulphurous emanations. I had rather\r\npitch my tent in the crater of Vesuvius, the valley of Solfatera, or the\r\nhut of a charbonnier in the Maremma, than in the vicinity of that sable\r\ndistillery of “Northumberland diamonds,” from which every ray of light\r\nhas been previously extracted by the gasometer.\r\n\r\n27. _Verlobung, or betrothing._—The German system of affiance appears\r\nto me to be a long courtship, and “something more.” It is a kind of\r\n“little-go,” or ante-marriage contract, attended with form, ceremony, and\r\nsequences. The affianced pair send out their cards bound together in the\r\nsilken bonds of Hymen, in perspective—are waited on and congratulated\r\nby their friends,—are always invited together to parties, where they\r\nsit next each other at table, engross each other’s conversation, and\r\nappear like—or rather _unlike_, man and wife. At page 24 of this volume,\r\nI ventured some observations on the danger and the miseries that often\r\nattend on affiances, or long-promised marriages. Notwithstanding the\r\napproval of Mrs. Jameson, I still hold my opinion. That lady indeed, is\r\nnot blind to some of the consequences of the verlobung. One of them will\r\nbe sufficient. “As the bridegroom is expected to devote every leisure\r\nmoment to the society of his betrothed—as he attends her to all public\r\nplaces—as they are invariably seated next each other,—_they have time\r\nto become tolerably tired of each others’ society before marriage, and\r\nhave nothing left to say_.” This is a charming prospect for matrimony!\r\nThe soft looks, the fine speeches, the glowing sentiments, nay even the\r\npretty riens, are all expended during the protracted affiance, and when,\r\nat last, the knot is tied indissolubly, the gallant gay lothario is, as\r\nRosalind says—“gravelled for lack of matter.”\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Jameson says that this long state of probation enables the\r\nparties to study well their respective characters, and detect failings\r\nand faults which a short courtship would be apt to over-look. Now the\r\naffiance is either binding or not binding. If the latter, of what use is\r\nit? If the _former_, it is small consolation to the bride or bridegroom\r\nto ascertain the causes of future misery before even Hymen lights his\r\ntorch! But who is unaware that courtship is a kind of warfare, in which\r\nthe belligerents take good care to mask their weak points and magnify\r\ntheir strong positions. The Germans themselves, indeed, have an adage\r\nthat runs in little accordance with the tedious VERLOBUNG.\r\n\r\n    “Early woo’d and early won,\r\n    Was never repented under the sun.”\r\n\r\n28. _March of Population._—Nothing exhibits a greater contrast between\r\nEngland and the Continent than the progress of population. I believe it\r\ngoes on at least three times as fast in the British Isles as in France\r\nand Germany. Many causes may be assigned for this disproportion. The\r\nimmense outlet for redundant population in our colonies—the prodigious\r\nextent of our commerce and manufactures—the early period of marriage,\r\nespecially in Ireland—these are among the chief causes of the rail-road\r\nspeed at which the multiplication of mankind goes on in this country.\r\nOn the Continent, it is just the reverse. The pace of population there\r\nis quite “_a la schnell-post_.” But lest this degree of velocity should\r\nendanger the state waggon, government (in many parts of Germany)\r\nhas affixed a drag to the wheels, in the shape of a law prohibiting\r\nmatrimony, unless the high contracting parties can produce proof of their\r\npossessing ways and means for supporting themselves and families. If\r\nthis regulation obtained in Great Britain, it would stop one half of the\r\nmarriages in Scotland, two-thirds of those in England, and nine-tenths\r\nof those in Ireland. Here is a hint for the Poor Law Commissioners, that\r\nmay induce them to bring a Bill into Parliament for the prevention of\r\nimprudent marriages, which would be more effectual in checking pauperism\r\nthan the terrors of the workhouse.\r\n\r\nBut, when we consider that colonization and commerce carry off an\r\nimmense redundancy of British population, how are we to account for the\r\n_permanent_ or domiciliated population of these islands increasing so\r\nmuch more rapidly than that of the Continent, where the safety-valves are\r\nof such narrow dimensions? There are some causes of these different rates\r\nof progression, which are little known in this country; but the chief\r\ncause must be the greater degree of prudence exercised by the people of\r\nFrance and Germany than by the people of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n29. _Poetry._—The transition from population to poetry is not so abrupt\r\nas might at first appear; for although we may have population without\r\npoetry, we shall rarely have poetry without population. Looking at the\r\n_words_ of the German language, a stranger to that language would be apt\r\nto conclude that it must be as difficult to mould them into music or\r\npoetry, as to convert hob-nails into ivory teeth—the bristles of a boar\r\ninto the ermine of a judge—or the rocks of Iona into columns of crystal.\r\nYet nothing would be a more erroneous prejudice than this conclusion.\r\nThe German, like the English language, is so rich in _synonimes_, as to\r\nafford every facility for the intonations of the musician, and variety\r\nof expression of the poet. The poverty of the French language in this\r\nrespect, presents a remarkable contrast to the German and English. French\r\npoetry must have the jingle of rhyme to make it bearable by the ear. A\r\nFrench poem in blank verse, would be like a monkey striding along on huge\r\nstilts, exciting roars of laughter from the spectators. But this poverty\r\nin synonims, renders the French language more precise, and the individual\r\nwords less equivocal than in any other. Hence its universal advantages in\r\ndiplomatic communications, where the synonims of other tongues would give\r\nrise to perpetual ambiguity and quibble.\r\n\r\nA curious, not to say ludicrous, attempt has lately been made by an\r\nAmerican author to transplant the poetry of Goethe and Schiller into\r\nEnglish by _literal_ translation, the said author maintaining that\r\npoetry _will_ be poetry _still_; and that the more close and servile\r\nthe traduction, the better will the spirit of the original poetry be\r\npreserved! The following rather favourable specimen of this attempt\r\nto clothe German ideas in English words, is quite a “curiosity of\r\nliterature,” and worth preserving.\r\n\r\n“TO A NATURALIST.\r\n\r\n    “‘_What Nature hides within_’—\r\n    O thou Philistine!—\r\n    ‘_No finite mind can know._’\r\n    My friend, of this thing\r\n    We think thou needest not\r\n    So oft remind us:\r\n    We fancy: Spot for spot\r\n    _Within_ we find us.\r\n    ‘_Happy who her doth win_\r\n    _The outmost shell to show!_’\r\n    Now that these sixty years I’ve heard repeated,\r\n    And, oft as heard, with silent curses greeted.\r\n    I whisper o’er and o’er this truth eternal:—\r\n    Freely doth nature all things tell;\r\n    Nature hath neither shell\r\n    Nor kernel;\r\n    Whole every where, at each point thou canst learn all.\r\n    Only examine thine own heart.\r\n    Whether _thou_ shell or kernel art.”[98]\r\n\r\nNow if any Transatlantic Philistine can crack the shell of this German\r\nnut, and extract an eatable kernel, he must possess a MANDUCATOR pretty\r\nconsiderably stronger than that with which SAMPSON cracked the skulls of\r\nthe ancient Philistines in the Holy Land—the jaw-bone of an ass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The following is a rough attempt at a free translation of the above\r\ncelebrated passage in Horace.\r\n\r\n    Behind the gilded coach pale Care ascends,\r\n    And haunts his victim wheresoe’er he wends,\r\n    On foreign shores the exile tries, in vain,\r\n    To banish thought, and fly from mental pain.\r\n\r\n[2] A gentleman, to whom I was remarking on the universal desire for\r\nCHANGE, evinced by passengers of every kind of politics and religion,\r\nobserved that he, at least, was an exception. “I am going (said he) to\r\ncross the Pontine Marshes by the ancient road—the VIA ROMANA. Now it\r\nmust be admitted that, in so doing, I am holding to the grand principle\r\nof the _conservatives_ and _Chinese_—‘STARE SUPER VIAS ANTIQUAS.’” I\r\nacknowledged the ingenuity of the argument; but questioned the policy of\r\nthe measure. I counselled him not to “stare” it too long on the “Vias\r\nAntiquas” of the Pontine fens, but rather to keep _moving_ there, lest\r\nhis own constitution should shortly afterwords come in need of _reform_.\r\n\r\n[3] Mr. Chambers alludes to a curious custom in Holland—that of the\r\nfemales sitting on chafing-dishes or, in fact, warming-pans. This custom\r\nis prevalent in many parts of Germany, and is universal among the better\r\nclasses of women in Italy. It is not on account of the dampness of the\r\nclimate that it is adopted; but because there are no fire-places, where\r\na female can have the luxury of putting her feet on the fender, by a\r\ncheerful fire, while conversing with her friend or reading a novel. The\r\natmosphere of a continental apartment, already vitiated by the vile\r\nGerman stove, is rendered still farther malodorous as well as malarious\r\nby the fumes from the foot-stool or warming-pan.\r\n\r\n[4] With another painting I was more at home—Rembrandt’s “Dissection.”\r\nIt has been said by a connoisseur that—“the corpse is less an image of\r\ndeath than a vehicle of colour. It adjusts the equilibrium of _warmth\r\nand coolness_, and supplies a focus of _brilliancy_ which irradiates the\r\nwhole scene.” I doubt whether this picture was painted from _life_ (I see\r\nI am infected by the neighbouring bull), for such a corpse has never come\r\nbefore me in the various dissecting-rooms which I have visited.\r\n\r\n[5] The Mer de Glace, for instance, is perpetually bearing on its surface\r\nenormous blocks of rock detached from the sides of Mont Blanc, and\r\ntravelling onward, however slowly, to the Rhone, and to the Sea.\r\n\r\n[6] “Its ample volume (Rhine) of water from bank to bank, bearing a\r\ngreater resemblance to the Thames at Westminster, than any river with\r\nwhich I am acquainted.”—_Chambers_, p. 49.\r\n\r\n[7] Leigh’s Rhenish Album, 1840.\r\n\r\n[8] I have attempted a liberal rather than a literal translation of this\r\nremarkable passage in Horace.\r\n\r\n    At palace gate and cottage door\r\n      Death knocks alike, nor long nor loud—\r\n    The shuddering tenant, rich or poor,\r\n      Next morn lies folded in the shroud.\r\n\r\n[9] Although the blue-eyed Maid of the Moselle, and the yellow-haired\r\nLord of the Rhine do not appear, at first, to relish the marriage that\r\nhas been suddenly and unceremoniously forced upon them; yet they soon get\r\nreconciled, and afterwards set a good example to married folks on land.\r\nThey jog on harmoniously through rough and smooth, to the end of the\r\nmatrimonial journey, without altercations or recriminations—and without\r\napplication to Doctors’ Commons for divorce, alimony, or pin-money!\r\n\r\n[10] Planché.\r\n\r\n[11] Of these lines I shall attempt a rude translation.\r\n\r\n    Grand-mamma was a MAG, who laid eggs by the score;\r\n    And had she not died, might have laid many more.\r\n\r\n[12] The Mineral Waters of Wisbaden. By Dr. Peez, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[13] In a Note to page 127 of Dr. Peez’s work, we have the following\r\nwords:—“There are some chemists, as for example, the Aulic Councillor\r\nSTRUVE, (_evidently actuated by mercantile motives_) who charge us with\r\npurposely attempting to involve the origin and efficacy of mineral\r\nsprings in a magic gloom.” This is not a very _liberal_ insinuation!\r\n\r\n“_Mercantile motives!_” What motives led the doctor to study, and now\r\nto practise physick?—_Answer._ Merely to heal the sick without fee or\r\nreward. What are the motives which lead the lawyer to waste his time and\r\nhealth by the midnight lamp, studying Coke upon Littleton?—_Answer._ The\r\nprospective pleasure of pleading the causes of those who come into court\r\n“in forma pauperis”! But then there is the parson. He spends years of\r\nhis life and thousands of his money at Oxford and Cambridge, studying\r\ntheology and mythology—with the view of going forth to preach the word\r\nto Jew and Gentile, and without the most remote prospect of worldly\r\nadvantage! _Mercantile motives, indeed!_ Dr. Struve with great labour,\r\nexpense, and skill, has imitated the Wisbaden waters, so that those who\r\nare unable to ascend the Rhine, may yet drink at the Kochbrunnen, without\r\nfeeing the SPA DOCTOR.\r\n\r\n[14] The fatal effects of hot-bathing in the case of the late Duke of\r\nNassau, have been alluded to, when speaking of the EMS waters.\r\n\r\n[15] Mineral Wells of Wisbaden, p. 360-6.\r\n\r\n[16] If Æachus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus still retain their seats on a\r\ncertain bench beyond the Styx, I opine that many of the petty sovereigns\r\nof Germany may be taken to task about the revenue which they gained in\r\nthe upper regions by selling licenses to gambling-houses.\r\n\r\n[17] It is not long since an antediluvian elephant was discovered on the\r\nshores of Siberia, and whose flesh was eatable by the dogs and wolves of\r\nthat country.\r\n\r\n[18] The _average_ duration of human life in London is 40 years, in the\r\ncountry, from 40 to 60, according to the salubrity of the place.\r\n\r\n[19] Lee on the Mineral Waters of Nassau, 1839.\r\n\r\n[20] “Vous sortez des eaux de Schlangenbad _rajeuni cum un Phœnix_—la\r\njeunesse y devient plus belle, plus brillante, et l’age y trouve une\r\nnouvelle vigeur.”—Fenner, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[21] “The people of England have flocked within the last few years to\r\nSchlangenbad, to bathe in its _foul_ water, drawn from tanks and used in\r\ntubs.”—Granville, vol. 1, p. 132.\r\n\r\n[22] I would advise Dr. Granville not to revisit the “Brunnens,” as\r\na very considerable prejudice exists against him there—especially at\r\nSchlangenbad, where I understood, they were training a band of serpents\r\nto hiss him out of the valley, should he ever re-enter it. Be this as\r\nit may, I think he stands little chance of receiving an “ORDER” from\r\nthe Duke of Nassau—unless it be such a one as two of his brethren (Drs.\r\nDowney and Lee,) received in the Summer of 1839—an “ORDER” to quit the\r\nduchy in forty-eight hours.[23] This was neither a _civil_ nor a military\r\norder, but through the police: it was one which my friend, Theodore Hook,\r\nwould be very apt to call an “ORDER OFF THE BATH.” I suspect, indeed,\r\nthat this would be my own fate, as well as that of Dr. Granville—but for\r\nvery different reasons—not for depreciating the virtues of the waters,\r\nbut for stigmatizing the licenses of the hells.\r\n\r\n[23] This was, upon the whole, a liberal “notice to quit;” since it would\r\nbe difficult, I imagine, to point out any spot in the dukedom, whence an\r\n“exeat regno” might not be practicable in forty-eight minutes, on a good\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n[24] One would suppose from the number, profundity, and duration of\r\nthese salaams, that Germans, of all ages and both sexes, had studied in\r\nthe “Imperial Academy of Ceremonies” at Pekin. Such outrageous bowing,\r\ncap-doffing, pipe-squaring, spine-wriggling, and _bussel_-rending, I\r\nnever beheld in any other country, except the Celestial Empire. The\r\nGerman, indeed, is taught civility or politeness from infancy, and far am\r\nI from censuring this overplus of amenity.\r\n\r\n[25] It must, at the same time, be confessed that, in Germany, all this\r\nquietude, order, and decorum, _appear_ to be the result of a spontaneous\r\ndisposition of the people. There is no _visible_ governing or directing\r\npower—no policemen at the corner of every street, or gens-d’armes\r\nwatching their movements! All is _seemingly_ automatic. Yet there\r\nmust be some strong arm behind the scene—much careful pre-arrangement\r\nand organization to effect this tranquillity and regularity. We see a\r\nsteam-carriage fly along a rail-road, without any outward or visible\r\nimpelling power; but what complicated machinery is stowed inside? What\r\nvast labour was expended before the automaton started on the road! So it\r\nmay be with Germany.\r\n\r\n[26] See a verification of these facts in the MORNING CHRONICLE, of\r\nSaturday, December 14th, 1839.\r\n\r\n[27] Effodiuntur opes irritamenta malorum.\r\n\r\n[28]\r\n\r\n    “Vice is a monster of such horrid mein,\r\n    That to be hated, needs but to be seen—\r\n    But seen too oft—familiar with his face,\r\n    We first endure—then pity—then embrace.”\r\n\r\n[29] Granville, vol. 1, p. 110.\r\n\r\n[30] I do not, for one moment, doubt the fidelity of Dr. Granville’s\r\ndescription; but I am convinced that the effects which he describes were\r\nmore owing to some happy mood in which he was at the time, than to any\r\npeculiar properties of the waters. Let us remember the expression of\r\nthe Frenchman in the Serpent’s Bath at Schlangenbad—“_dans ces bains on\r\ndevient absoluement amoreux de soi-même_.” Now, I do not see why Dr. G.\r\nmight not have “fallen in love with self,” in the baths of Wildbad, as\r\nwell as Monsieur in those of Schlangenbad.\r\n\r\n[31] “Chargé par son Excellence Mons. le Comte De Witt, General au\r\nservice de la Russie, j’ai l’honneur d’avertir Mons. le Docteur Johnson,\r\nqu’il est prié de se trouver a la fête que Mons. le Comte donnera ce soir\r\nau Palais Royal.\r\n\r\n                                          “Wildbad, Aug. 18, 1839. HEIM.”\r\n\r\nCircumstances did not permit me to accept the kind invitation, and I\r\ncan only thus return my thanks to Count De Witt for his politeness to a\r\ncasual bath-acquaintance.\r\n\r\n[32] The public and promiscuous bathing of both sexes, so common on\r\nthe Continent, is more easily condemned by prejudice than convicted\r\nby argument. I confess that I was fairly beaten out of the field by a\r\nGerman philosopher, while discussing the point. _First_, he urged the\r\nantiquity of the practice—the Romans having public baths for both sexes\r\nindiscriminately, on a most magnificent scale. The larger the bath,\r\nhowever, the less the objection, and _vice versa_, which he acknowledged.\r\n_Secondly_, he asked me what there was in the element _water_, to render\r\npromiscuous assemblages of the sexes more indelicate than in the element\r\nair? I answered that in the latter element the people were dressed.\r\nDressed! he exclaimed. Why in the _bath_ they are closely clothed from\r\nthe chin to the soles of the feet; while in the _ball-room_ the ladies\r\nexclude dress from every spot which they dare expose without outraging\r\ndecency! There was no denying this. He added that, it was surely as\r\nunobjectionable for invalids of both sexes to walk and wade about in the\r\nbath, during the open day, as for people in high health to waltz about\r\nin crowded assemblies, during the middle of the night. On observing\r\nthat the English were shocked at the practice of bathing promiscuously,\r\nbecause their eyes were unaccustomed to the sight; he replied, “exactly\r\nso—and the Germans, who are accustomed to it, feel nothing at all on the\r\noccasion.” The only objection on which I was obliged to fall back, was\r\nthe loss of friction and shampooing in the bath—a drawback which the\r\nGerman admitted as unavoidable in public baths, but which, he maintained,\r\nwas, in some degree, compensated for by the pleasure of conversation and\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\n[33] The “AUXILIARY” which I have recommended to be taken over night,\r\nwhile using the waters of WISBADEN, would prevent or mitigate the\r\nspa-fever, or “bad-sturm” of WILDBAD, without any abatement of the\r\nmedicinal effects of the waters.\r\n\r\n                                                                    J. J.\r\n\r\n[34] This child of the Revolution, and of fickle fortune, fell at the\r\nbattle of Dresden, and his body lies interred on the frozen banks of the\r\nNeva!\r\n\r\n[35] Planché.\r\n\r\n[36] Mr. and Miss Hayward, Mrs. and Miss Johnson (now Mrs. Jackson) and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n[37] Since the foregoing account was drawn up—now nearly six years\r\nago—great improvements have taken place in the Baths of Pfeffers. A good\r\nroad for char-a-bancs and light cars is constructed from Ragatz to the\r\nBaths, and the whole establishment has been taken out of the hands of the\r\nmonks of the neighbouring monastery, and put into lay hands. The Bad-haus\r\nis improved, and better accommodations are provided for strangers. I\r\nshould not be surprized if this place becomes fashionable one day, and\r\neclipses Wildbad and Toeplitz!\r\n\r\n[38] “Le pont est etroit, souvent glissant, et quelquefois on n’est\r\nseparé que par une seule planche du noir abîme de la TAMINA.”\r\n\r\n[39] It is surprising that the author of the “Voyage Pittoresque en\r\nSuisse,” and even Dr. Ebell, should have been led into the monstrous\r\nerror of imagining that the torrent of the Tamina had, in the course of\r\nages, hollowed out of the marble rock this profound bed for itself. We\r\nmight just as well suppose, that the bed of the Mediterranean had been\r\nscooped out by the waters of the Hellespont, in their way from the Black\r\nSea to the Atlantic. The mountain was rent by some convulsion of Nature,\r\nand apparently from below upwards, as the breadth, at the bed of the\r\nTamina, is far broader than the external crevice above.\r\n\r\n[40] This has not always been the case. The talented authoress of\r\n“Reminiscences of the Rhine,” &c. appears to have lacked courage for\r\nthis enterprise, though her beautiful daughters advanced to the further\r\nextremity of the gorge.\r\n\r\n[41] This circumstance illustrates, in a very remarkable manner, the\r\neffects of passing from a hot, or vapour-bath, into cold air or water.\r\nThe immunity is nearly certain. The hotter the medium from which we start\r\ninto the cold, the less danger there is of suffering any inconvenience.\r\nThis principle in Hygiene is more understood than practised. It will be\r\nadverted to farther on.\r\n\r\n[42] Lest I should be suspected of exaggeration, in this account of\r\nthe Baths of Pfeffers, I shall here introduce a short extract from\r\n“REMINISCENCES OF THE RHINE,” &c. by Mrs. Boddington—a work eulogised\r\nto the skies in the Edinburgh Review, and its author represented (and,\r\nI understand, deservedly) as a lady of very superior talents and strict\r\nveracity. After some slight notice of the Bath-house, Mrs. B. proceeds\r\nthus:—\r\n\r\n    “Behind rolls the stormy Tamina, hemmed in at one side by the\r\n    dark Bath-house and the impending cliffs, while, on the other,\r\n    a giant wall of perpendicular rock, starting up daringly, and\r\n    shutting out the world—almost the light of Heaven—closes up\r\n    the scene. Our guide proposed that we should visit the mineral\r\n    springs that boil up from the depth of an awful cavern, several\r\n    hundred paces from the Bath-house. A bridge, thrown from rock\r\n    to rock, crosses the flood, and a narrow ledge of planks,\r\n    fixed, I know not how, against the side of the rock, and\r\n    suspended over the fierce torrent, leads through a long dark\r\n    chasm to the source. I ventured but a little way; for, when I\r\n    found myself on the terrifying shelf, without the slightest\r\n    ballustrade, and felt it slippery, from the continual spray,\r\n    and saw nothing between us and the yawning gulf, to which\r\n    darkness, thickening at every step, gave increased horror, I\r\n    made a few rapid reflections on foolhardiness, and retreated.”\r\n\r\nThe following lines were found in an Album at an Inn in the Canton of\r\nGlarus, in the Summer of 1825, written by an anonymous English tourist,\r\nimmediately after visiting the Baths of Pfeffers.\r\n\r\n[Communicated by C. Raine, Esq.]\r\n\r\n    Oft hast thou marvell’d much, I trow.\r\n    At him who twirl’d with well pois’d toe\r\n        On Strasburg’s pointed spire:—\r\n    Or him who, on the quivering slope\r\n    Of the tight-brac’d elastic rope,\r\n        Could bound in air much higher:—\r\n    But had they quaffed the fervid wave\r\n    In PFEFFERS’ dark and vapoury cave—\r\n        (Those half adventurous people)—\r\n    And paced the dizzy, fragile plank\r\n    Along the chasm’s terrific flank,\r\n    They then had scorned the paltry prank\r\n        Of dancing on a steeple.\r\n\r\n[43] In an old account of the baths we find the following passage:—“The\r\nwater of these baths is extremely clear, without taste or smell. It bears\r\nwith it the most subtle spirits of sulphur, nitre, vitriol, and divers\r\nmetals—amongst others, GOLD.”\r\n\r\n[44] In many people they produce slight vertigo—in more, they act freely\r\non the bowels. They were discovered in the 12th century, by two chasseurs\r\nfrom the neighbouring monastery, who were seeking birds’ nests in the\r\nravine of the Tamina. For a long time they could only descend to these\r\nbaths by means of ropes; but at length human ingenuity formed zig-zags\r\nalong the rocks. As if every thing relating to these waters should\r\npartake of the wonderful, it may be mentioned that they begin to flow in\r\nMay, when the Summer is approaching—are at their acmé when the skies are\r\nfervid and the land parched with thirst, yielding 1500 pints of water\r\nevery minute—and cease entirely in September, when the rains begin to\r\nfall, and the mountain streams to pour freely along every declivity!\r\n\r\n[45] A German writer informs us that the country people stay in these\r\nbaths from Saturday night till Monday morning. “Tous les Samedis on voit\r\naccourir à Pfeffers une multitude de gens des campagne voisines, et ils\r\nrestent dans le bains jusqu’au Lundi matin pour provoquer la sueur.”\r\n\r\n[46] Dr. Engel, of Vienna.\r\n\r\n[47] For further particulars, see the Third Edition of my “ECONOMY OF\r\nHEALTH,” or Stream of Human Life, &c.\r\n\r\n[48] Unfortunately I find that gambling _is_ permitted in Aix by the\r\nPrussian government to all non-residents!\r\n\r\n[49] In the interval between 1834 and 1840, when I last visited this\r\nplace, Ems has been completely metamorphosed. I could scarcely recognize\r\nit, so much has it been embellished and improved. It is now one of the\r\nprettiest spas in Germany. A line of handsome buildings, a mile in\r\nlength, with a magnificent Cursaal in the centre, stretches along the\r\nLahn, while new edifices are fast rising on the other side of the river.\r\nBeautiful promenades are formed all along this line, between the houses\r\nand the Lahn, while two bands of music play several hours in the day. The\r\nview from the highest point of the Morshutte, is very picturesque.\r\n\r\n[50] A short time ago Ems had nearly shaken the foundation of Carlsbad.\r\nOn cutting down, with incredible labour, through a bed of schistus and\r\nother rock, on the opposite side of the Lahn, a spring boiled up with\r\na force equal to that of the Sprudel, and at a temperature of 168° of\r\nFahrenheit! The inundation, by infiltration, from the Lahn, overpowered\r\nthe efforts of the workmen, and the enterprize was abandoned. Various\r\nfragments of masonry and wood were found in this place, rendering it\r\nprobable that, at some remote period—perhaps in the time of the Romans,\r\nthere was a thermal fountain in this place. The water is still seen\r\nboiling up from the bed of the river at this place, and, on immersing my\r\nthermometer in the water of the Lahn there, the mercury stood at 104°.\r\n\r\n[51] Ems, Les Eaux Thermales. Par M. Doring, 1839.\r\n\r\n[52] Dr. Doring affirms that bathing in the Ems waters is quite as\r\nsalutary in Winter as in Summer.\r\n\r\n[53] By far the pleasantest way to Kissengen is the cross-road, leaving\r\nWurtzburg far to the right. It will occupy about two and a half days’\r\nposting from Frankfort, through a highly picturesque and beautiful\r\ncountry. Aschaffenburgh is the first night’s resting-place. The second\r\ndays’ journey leads through a portion of the ancient Hercynian forest,\r\nand presents very fine scenery.\r\n\r\n[54] Balling, p. 33.\r\n\r\n[55] Ibidem.\r\n\r\n[56] Balling, p. 38-9.\r\n\r\n[57] It is a little remarkable that Dr. Granville scarcely makes any\r\nallusion to this reactive process so conspicuous in the Kissengen\r\nwaters—and which is dwelt upon by the writers on all the energetic spas\r\nof Germany. It is by far the most important phenomenon which medicinal\r\nwaters present, and requires the most vigilant attention. I have not the\r\nleast doubt that it is owing to the want of light aperient alteratives\r\ntaken over night, by which the biliary and other glandular secretions are\r\nkept in a state of activity, corresponding with the action kept up on the\r\nbowels by the waters.—_See the Section on Carlsbad._\r\n\r\n[58] It would have been well if the late Duke of Nassau had observed this\r\nrule—or rather if he had avoided these baths entirely.—_J.J._\r\n\r\n[59] By the way, those visitors, who merely pass a day or two at\r\nKissengen, without any intention of taking the waters, have reason to\r\ncomplain of the tax imposed on them by the King of Bavaria. When the\r\n“reckoning” comes in, they find two florins for each person in the party\r\ncharged by the master of the hotel. I believe, however, that this is\r\nan imposition of the hotels, and that four or five days’ residence are\r\nallowed, before the tax is due.\r\n\r\n[60] It may be proper to state that, in a more recent analysis by\r\nProfessor FROMMSDORFF, some other ingredients were discovered, although\r\nthe aggregate quantity of saline matters was 34 grains, as above. The new\r\nmatters were very minute quantities of oxide of manganese—carbonate of\r\nlithion—carbonate of strontian—and phosphate of magnesia.\r\n\r\n[61] The Baron suggests the more frequent application of this gas to\r\ncertain complaints of both sexes which are regarded with no small anxiety\r\nby both parties. _Verbum sat._\r\n\r\n[62] Dr. Clarus, Dr. Granville, and others state that the skin exhales\r\nan acid odour, and even feels salt to the tongue for several hours after\r\nleaving the bath. This I did not perceive in my own case at all.\r\n\r\n[63] There is another source in the forest, ten minutes walk from the\r\nKreuzbrunn, which contains double the quantity of solid materials found\r\nin the Carolinenbrunn, termed Waldbrunnen.\r\n\r\n[64] Heidler, p. 334.\r\n\r\n[65] The apparatus at Marienbad are admirably constructed, both for\r\nsafety and efficacy. The hole in the lid of the bath embraces, by the\r\naid of a handkerchief, so well the throat, that no gas escapes, while\r\nthe patient suffers no difficulty of breathing. The gas enters by a tube\r\nat the bottom of the bath, and the superfluity is carried off by several\r\nothers that enter near the top. Some covering is proper over the part\r\nexposed to the _current_ of the gas from the pipe, to prevent taking\r\ncold—as the clothes do not, in the slightest degree, diminish the action\r\nof the gas on the body or members, provided they are light and thin.\r\n\r\n[66] Lobkowitz. Ode to the Sprudel—nearly 300 years ago.\r\n\r\n[67] The route by the Elbe, from Hamburg, through Dresden and Saxon\r\nSwitzerland, will now render the journey from London easy.\r\n\r\n[68] _Note from Mr. Spitta to Dr. Johnson._\r\n\r\nThe ancient history of _Carlsbad_ is interesting: it shews the powers of\r\nmendacious tradition. There is a certain mountain on the left bank of the\r\nTeple, termed _Hirschensprung_ [Spring of the stag], which carries in its\r\nvery name a wondrous tale.\r\n\r\nAs early as the middle of the fourteenth century, Charles IV. Emperor\r\nof Germany, and King of Bohemia, was pursuing a stag, and the animal,\r\npressed closely by the hounds, ascended that lofty mountain. The\r\nhuntsmen, unable to follow, on account of the steepness of the ascent,\r\nwere returning by the bank of the river, supposing they had lost their\r\ngame, when—imagine their surprise—they heard the cries of the scalded\r\nanimal on the opposite side. The cause was easily explained. In the last\r\ndespairing hope of escape, the animal had made a leap, from the top of\r\nthe Hirschensprung, over the Teple; and had fallen, quite accidentally,\r\ninto the boiling, bubbling Sprudel. The distance, as the crow flies,\r\nmay be a mile, perhaps a mile and a half (more or less), a difference\r\nin tradition’s eye, of no importance. Thus the stag was found, and the\r\nSprudel discovered, simultaneously. Tradition’s stories are always\r\ncomplete. King Charles happened to have a bad leg, for which (of course)\r\nthe exercise of hunting was beneficial; he happened to try the waters,\r\nand happened to get well. The place henceforth assumed his name, Carlsbad\r\n(Charles’ bath), and rose by degrees to the importance it now possesses.\r\n\r\n[69] Although the proportion of iodine and other materials, appears small\r\nto the ALLOPATH, it is reckoned prodigious by the HOMŒOPATH, who indeed,\r\nconsiders that the surplus waters which flow from the Sprudel into the\r\nTeple, are quite sufficient to impregnate the stream of the Elbe at\r\nHamburgh abundantly for all medicinal purposes. M. Creutzburg calculates\r\nthat, in the course of a season at Carlsbad, during which he drank 404\r\ngoblets of the waters, there were 3¼ grains of hydriodate of soda, in\r\nthat quantity. The quantity of carbonic acid gas in the pint is about 12\r\ncubic inches.\r\n\r\n[70] There is another spring, the Bernard’s Brunnen, near the New\r\nBrunnen, which has a temperature as high as that of the Sprudel; but I\r\nbelieve it is seldom used. The Schlossbrunnen, much higher up the hill,\r\nis the least hot of all—and the Marktbrunnen, near the Muhlbrunn, is next\r\nto it in temperature. It exhales some odour of sulphur.\r\n\r\n[71] _Note from Mr. Spitta._\r\n\r\nI brought home one of the pretty stamps, made of Sprudelstein; and\r\nhad the cruelty to break it up for chemical examination. I found it\r\nto be composed, as stalactites in all parts of the world are, of the\r\nearthy carbonates; which, originally held in solution by carbonic acid\r\ngas, are precipitated on its escape. The Sprudel contains a very small\r\nquantity of carbonic acid, only sufficient, as Beecher has observed,\r\nto keep its earthy carbonates in solution. As the water approaches\r\nthe exit of the cauldron, and the gas ceases to be under pressure, it\r\nresumes its wonted elasticity, passes quietly off with the vapour which\r\nissues from the boiler, and leaves its irony carbonates, sticking to\r\nthe edge of the reservoir. Carbonate of lime is the main ingredient of\r\nthe Sprudelstein—it contains besides, carbonate of magnesia and iron;\r\nto the latter, its reddish-brown colour is to be attributed. There is\r\na portion of iron also, as peroxyde; and minute traces of one or two\r\nother substances. With regard to the incrustations: they are nothing\r\nmore nor less than _petrifactions_ (as they are called), made exactly in\r\nthe same manner as other petrifactions, by the deposition of the _earthy\r\ncarbonates_. The difference in colour from other petrifactions arises\r\nfrom the difference in the composition of the Sprudel water and the water\r\nin other parts, where the _white_ incrustations are formed. The Sprudel\r\ncontains a small quantity of the _carbonate of iron_. This is deposited\r\nwith the carbonates of lime and magnesia; and hence the brown colour.\r\n\r\n[72] “Le celebre Carus a publié une tres-interessant Memoire sur les\r\nEaux Minerales, sur leur vitalité, sur leur formation dans le sein de la\r\nterre, qu’il considere comme un _organism animé_, dont ces eaux sont les\r\nsecretions, aussi differentes entre elles que les fluides elaborés par\r\nles divers organs secretoires du corps humain.”—DE CARRO.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the idea of daily ingurgitating such lots of\r\n_secretions_ from some “great unknown” animal in the bowels of the earth,\r\nis not a very comfortable one, and requires a stouter _stomach_ than that\r\nwhich is necessary for the digestion of the bear’s broth at Wisbaden.\r\nThere is one consolation, that the whole is a dream; since there is just\r\nas much proof or probability of the Spas of Germany being a _secretion_\r\nfrom a living animal, as that the German Ocean is a secretion from\r\nNeptune or Amphitrite.\r\n\r\n[73] The remarkable influence of mind over matter, and hope over both,\r\nwas exemplified in 1839, in the person of Surgeon Fraser, of the Bombay\r\nestablishment. Being reduced almost to a skeleton by a disease, the\r\nnature of which could not be ascertained, he happened to see my review of\r\nDr. Granville’s book, and immediately determined to travel _over-land_\r\nto Carlsbad. He embarked in a steamer for Suez—thence was carried in a\r\nlitter between two camels across the Desert—embarked again at Alexandria\r\nfor Constantinople—thence through the Black Sea up the Danube, and on to\r\nCarlsbad, all this journey being sustained by hope, aided by “change of\r\nair.” At Carlsbad the waters were eagerly taken; but alas! were found to\r\ndo no good! He lost confidence in them, and proceeded to Marienbad in\r\na litter. He died two days after his arrival there, and left his bones\r\nin Bohemia! There is little doubt that had he travelled on, instead of\r\nstopping at Carlsbad, he might have reached his native mountains in the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\nOn dissection the disease was found to be in the mesenteric glands.\r\n\r\n[74] Carlsbad; ses Eaux Minerales. Par De Carro.\r\n\r\n[75] Sur les Eaux, p. 167.\r\n\r\n[76] It is a curious fact that the waters of Carlsbad often cause a\r\nswelling of the ankles, especially in females. Hoffman was the first who\r\nnoticed this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n[77] An English physician has realized a fortune by prescribing on this\r\nplan, and enforcing a strict system of diet. The combination used is very\r\nnearly the following:—\r\n\r\n  ℞. Infus. rosæ c. ℥viss.\r\n     Acidi sulph. dil. ʒiss.\r\n     Magnes sulphat. ℥j.\r\n     Tinct. gent. c. ℥ss.\r\n     Sulphatis ferri gr. vij.\r\n  Misce ft. mistura, capt. coch. ij. mag. primo mane et meridie.\r\n\r\nI prefer the following formula.\r\n\r\n  ℞. Extr. col. comp.\r\n     Pil. rhei. comp. aa ℈j.\r\n     —— hydrargyri gr. vj.\r\n     Ol. cassiæ, gtt. iv.\r\n  Misce ft. pil. xij. capt. i. vel. ij. hora somni omni nocte.\r\n  ℞.

In\r\n_both_ forms, there is some chemical decomposition, but the physiological\r\neffects are good.—J. J.\r\n\r\n[78] Les Bains de Gastein, p. 34.\r\n\r\n[79] Erroneously spelled Toeplitz by most travellers.\r\n\r\n[80] This was the picture which presented itself to Dr. Granville four\r\nor five years ago; but all is now changed. A dispute arose between the\r\ndoctors and the town council of Teplitz, as to the necessity or propriety\r\nof having the process of bleeding and bathing simultaneously carried\r\non—the doctors being _pro_, and the authorities _con_. Some of the\r\ndoctors, however, ratted, and declared that the practice of cupping was\r\nseldom necessary; and that, where it was deemed prudent, the operation\r\nmight be performed out of the bath, and without any flow of blood into\r\nthe water. The practice is now, therefore, almost entirely discontinued.\r\n\r\n[81] The whole of the solid contents of the various springs amounts to\r\nabout five grains in the pint, with a little iron.\r\n\r\n[82] This effect did not take place in my own person, nor in that of\r\nany other with whom I conversed on the subject. Dr. Richter, the latest\r\nwriter on the waters, does not mention it in his work, and he told me he\r\nhad very seldom observed it in the persons of bathers.\r\n\r\n[83] This analysis, as well as that of Sedlitz, I obtained at Bilin, at\r\nthe establishment of Prince Lobkowitz; and they are interesting as being\r\nthe most recent yet published. This appeared in 1840.\r\n\r\n[84] In the “HANDBUCK,” Mr. Murray has committed a mistake in killing\r\nPrince Colleredo here, instead of making him the fortunate soldier—“qui\r\ndecida la journée.”—Commend me to the Austrian policy. No man knew better\r\nthan Prince Metternich that one good living General was worth the full\r\nof a church-yard of dead ones. Colleredo fought hard, and distinguished\r\nhimself at the battle of Leipzig after the battle of Culm.\r\n\r\n[85] February 1814, and July 1815.\r\n\r\n[86] Many of the rocks have acquired distinct and permanent appellations\r\nfrom their rude, but often striking similitudes to animals and other\r\nobjects. More than one or two royal personages have here their profiles\r\n_en gigantesque_, encompased by other figures of more ignoble character,\r\nas “La grande Oie”—“La petite Oie”—“La Pierre de Merles”—“La Pierre de\r\nMiel”—“Pierres des Ours,”—“Pierre d’Agneau”—“Pierre de Fourterelle,” &c.\r\n\r\n[87] Did Napoleon adopt the BEE as his emblem, because that animal is\r\nequally expert in extracting the honey and implanting the sting?\r\n\r\n[88] His own words, as reported by Las Casas, were—“I was a Mahomedan in\r\nEgypt—a Catholic in France. I do not believe in forms of religion; but in\r\nthe existence of a Deity.” There is not an infidel or sceptic from the\r\nNorth to the South Pole, who doubts the existence of a God—provided he\r\nhas sense or reason enough to be able to distinguish his right hand from\r\nhis left. It was fortunate, perhaps, for Napoleon’s mental sufferings\r\nthat he believed not in a future state of existence, otherwise the ghost\r\nof D’Enghien would have stood by his death-bed, and rendered his last\r\nmoments most horrible! I need not allude to his divorce of Josephine, for\r\nhis character in matrimony!\r\n\r\n[89] These regalia are now removed to some other place. 1840.\r\n\r\n[90] A dagger is here preserved which, on entering the body, separates\r\ninto three parts, rendering extraction more dangerous than the primary\r\nwound!\r\n\r\n[91] By the way, the extreme care which the heroes of antiquity, as well\r\nas those of the middle-ages, took to cover every part of their bodies\r\nwith brass and iron plates, does not exhibit any very striking proof of\r\ntheir courage. Why should they not have fought without armour, trusting\r\nto activity, bravery, and strength, rather than to coats of mail? In the\r\nbest days of the Roman legions, they fought without armour.\r\n\r\n[92] In Saxony, the punishment of death is by decapitation.\r\n\r\n[93] From the researches of the Rev. Mr. Gleig, Scepticism has invaded\r\nthe Catholic camp!\r\n\r\n“But, even in Catholic countries, the cloven-foot of Scepticism is for\r\never thrusting itself from beneath the priest’s robe; while amongst\r\nthe Protestants, _to believe God’s word, as it is written, forms the\r\nexception to the general rule which Rationalism has established_.”—Vol.\r\nI. preface.\r\n\r\n[94] He might be represented as a person with two shadows. The shade\r\nbehind (time past) is tolerably distinct—that which is before (time to\r\ncome) is dim in the extreme, and ill-defined.\r\n\r\n[95] Russell’s Germany, Vol. I. pp. 123.\r\n\r\n[96] This trait in Gallic character has never been more clearly\r\ndiscerned, or more cleverly met than by Viscount Palmerston.
