It is, therefore, essentially an East Anglian Charity, and I\r\ndwell especially on this point, because, being situated at Colchester,\r\nI think there is an impression in certain quarters, that this\r\ninstitution is less intimately connected with this locality than some\r\nother charities, the claims of which are periodically brought under\r\nour notice. I feel that the managing body themselves have been to\r\nblame for this impression, from having in the first instance adopted\r\nthe ill-advised name of Essex Hall--a name, however, now abandoned, as\r\ntending to convey the impression that it was an Essex charity,\r\nwhereas, as I have before said, it is an institution intended for the\r\ncare and treatment of Idiots from the four Eastern Counties of\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, and Essex.\r\n\r\nI have so often been called upon to plead the cause of this charity\r\nbefore a Norfolk audience, that I should have preferred that some\r\nother person had been selected to represent the Asylum at this\r\nmeeting; for when the subject of the appeal is always the same, it is\r\ndifficult to prevent one's thoughts from occasionally running in a\r\nsimilar channel as on former occasions; the Board of Directors having,\r\nhowever, invited me to act as one of their deputation, I acceded to\r\ntheir request with the greater readiness, as it affords me the\r\nopportunity, on the part of the authorities of the Asylum, of\r\nexpressing our grateful thanks to his Grace the Duke of Norfolk for\r\nthe honour he has done us by his presence here to-day, thus evincing\r\nthe interest he takes in the charitable institutions of the county, by\r\nconsenting to preside over a public meeting in the historical city of\r\nNorwich.\r\n\r\nIn the few words that I shall address to you, I wish particularly to\r\navoid falling into the error common to many speakers--that of\r\nexaggerating the importance of the subject they are treating. Many a\r\ngood cause has been damaged by the indiscretion of its own advocates,\r\nwho, in their undue zeal, endeavour to impress their audiences with\r\nthe notion that the particular charity for which they plead is the one\r\nabove all others that has a paramount claim on the support of a\r\nphilanthropic public. Now, I have no desire to produce a sensational\r\neffect, or to create an artificial interest in my subject by indulging\r\nin the language of hyperbole. I have a plain unvarnished tale to tell,\r\nthat requires no meretricious adornment to arrest your attention, for\r\nI am here to plead the cause of an unfortunate branch of the human\r\nfamily, who, by the very nature of their infirmity, are unable to say\r\na single word for themselves, and whose mute appeal must excite\r\nuniversal sympathy.\r\n\r\nHappily, we live in an age when the spirit of philanthropy is abroad,\r\nand all that Christian sympathy can suggest is being done to relieve\r\nthe sick and suffering poor. Amidst all the boasted culture of\r\nantiquity there existed no hospital; go to Athens and to Rome, those\r\nseats of early civilization, and you will find at the former the ruins\r\nof the Acropolis, and those of the Coliseum at the latter, but no\r\ntrace of the remains of a hospital or asylum; whereas in the present\r\nday, hospitals and asylums are springing up in every locality, and\r\nEast Anglia is certainly no exception to the rule, abounding, as it\r\ndoes, in charitable institutions of every description, the object of\r\nwhich is to improve the condition of the labouring class, and to\r\nlessen the ills that flesh is heir to; and it may truly be said, as\r\nfar as this country is concerned, that--\r\n\r\n    \"The quality of mercy is not strain'd;\r\n    It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven\r\n    Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless'd:\r\n    It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst admitting all this, I maintain that there is an unfortunate\r\nclass--that of idiots--which has not hitherto received that share of\r\nattention to which it is entitled. Why is this? Is it due to a\r\npampered selfishness which has chosen to draw a curtain of\r\nindifference around this unfortunate branch of the human race? Is the\r\nfountain of charity frozen up in East Anglia? Nothing of the kind,\r\nand I think this apparent neglect is mainly due to a misconception as\r\nto the nature of idiocy, and as to the amount of amelioration of which\r\nthe subjects of this unfortunate infirmity are susceptible. It is with\r\nthe view of removing this erroneous impression, that I have been\r\nrequested to say a few words to you about idiocy, from a scientific\r\npoint of view, my desire being to instruct the mind of the public as\r\nto the nature and character of the evil to be contended with, as to\r\nthe probability of alleviating it, and as to the means best adapted to\r\nthe attainment of this object.\r\n\r\nIn the few remarks that I shall make, I hope to show you that the\r\nstudy of idiocy is fraught with interest, not only to the man of\r\nscience and the philanthropist, but to the political economist, the\r\nstatesman, and the theologian. If it be asked what possible connection\r\nthere can be between theology and idiocy, I would say, that if time\r\npermitted, I could show that the study of the nature and attributes of\r\nthe idiot has a striking bearing on the much-disputed question of the\r\nconnection between matter and mind, and also that it points to a\r\nconclusion directly opposed to the materialistic tendencies of the\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF IDIOCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat confusion exists in the public mind as to the nature of idiocy.\r\nWhat is an idiot? Dr. Séguin, a celebrated writer on this subject, has\r\ndescribed idiocy as a \"specific infirmity of the cerebro-spinal\r\ncentre,\" a definition which I need not say applies to a variety of\r\ninfirmities to which flesh is heir, and such a definition only serves\r\nas a cloak for ignorance. Shakespeare, that wonderfully accurate\r\nobserver of human nature, in several of his dramas has given a very\r\ngood description of the acts of the idiot, who, he says, is \"one who\r\nholds his bauble for his God;\" and again, as \"one who tells a tale\r\nfull of sound and fury, signifying nothing.\" But neither he nor the\r\npsychologists of his day knew enough of the natural history of the\r\nidiot to attempt a logical definition.\r\n\r\nAs I have spent a great deal of time in the investigation of obscure\r\npoints of cerebral pathology, of course the question of the idiot has\r\nnot escaped my attention, and I submit the following definition:--\r\n\r\nAn idiot is a human being who possesses the tripartite nature of\r\nman--body, soul, and spirit, σωμα, ψυχη, πνευμα, but who is the\r\nsubject of an infirmity consisting, anatomically, of a defective\r\norganisation and want of development of the brain, resulting in an\r\ninability, more or less complete, for the exercise of the\r\nintellectual, moral, and sensitive faculties. There are various shades\r\nand degrees of this want of development, from those whose mental and\r\nbodily deficiencies differ but slightly from the lowest of the\r\nso-called sound-minded, to those individuals who simply vegetate, and\r\nwhose deficiencies are so decided as to isolate them, as it were, from\r\nthe rest of nature.\r\n\r\nDr. Langdon Down[1] divides Idiocy into three primary groups:\r\nCongenital, Developmental, and Accidental. The Congenital includes all\r\ncases which at the period of birth manifest signs of the defective\r\nmental power. The Developmental group includes cases where the child\r\nmanifests an average intelligence through infancy, but he is born with\r\na proclivity to a mental break-down during one of the developmental\r\ncrises, such as the first dentition, the second dentition, and\r\npuberty; the brain and nervous power are sufficient for their early\r\nyears, but are insufficient to carry them through evolutional stages.\r\nThe Accidental group includes cases where the child has been born with\r\na normal nervous system, when unfortunately a fall, a fright,\r\nepilepsy, or some other cause may lead to a mental break-down, not of\r\na genetic, but of a purely accidental origin. The various forms of\r\nidiocy are described in minute detail by Dr. Ireland,[2] to whose\r\nclassical work I would refer those who may desire further information\r\non this subject.\r\n\r\nThe first idiot that attracted the attention of scientific men was\r\nlooked upon as a savage man, and every treatise on the subject\r\ncontains some allusion to the so-called savage of the Aveyron, who\r\nexcited so much curiosity, speculation, and interest among the\r\npsychologists of Paris in the early part of the present century.\r\n\r\nIn old books on medical nomenclature idiocy was classed amongst the\r\nvarieties of insanity, and the visitor to a lunatic asylum half a\r\ncentury ago, would find the idiot skulking in the corner of a\r\ncourtyard chained to a staple, and lying on a litter of straw; in\r\nfact, he was considered and treated more like a wild beast than a\r\nhuman being. He had but little talent given, and by neglect or abuse\r\nthat little was lost; until, growing more and more brutal, he sank\r\nunregetting and unregretted into an early grave, without ever being\r\ncounted as a man. Now, idiocy is not a form of insanity, and it is\r\nmost important that no confusion should exist in the public mind upon\r\nthis point, as the association of idiots and insane patients in the\r\nsame asylum is a positive disadvantage to both classes. It is always a\r\npainful thing to see idiot children, whose mental faculties and\r\nphysical powers, as I shall presently show, are capable of much\r\ndevelopment and improvement, wandering, without object or special\r\ncare, about the wards of a Lunatic Asylum. They cannot receive there\r\nthe training and supervision they specially require, and they often\r\nseriously interfere with the comfort of the other inmates, and meet in\r\nreturn, with ridicule and unkindness; moreover, their presence is a\r\nserious obstacle to the complete recovery of convalescent lunatics. I\r\ndesire especially to press this point upon the legislators of the\r\ncountry, and, as in this county, our union houses are far too large\r\nfor the requirements of the age, I would suggest that one or more of\r\nthem might, with advantage, be devoted to the care and treatment of\r\npauper idiots.[3]\r\n\r\nInsanity is a loss more or less complete of faculties formerly\r\npossessed, it consists of a perturbation of the mental faculties after\r\ntheir complete development, it begins with average intelligence which\r\ngradually diminishes; whereas idiocy begins with a low amount of\r\nintelligence, which, in many instances, gradually increases; the\r\ndifference has been thus beautifully described by a French\r\npsychologist, \"_L'homme en démence est privé des biens dont il\r\njouissait autrefois, c'est un riche devenu pauvre. L'idiot a toujours\r\nété dans l'infortune et la misère._\" (The man that is mad is deprived\r\nof possessions which he formerly enjoyed, it is a rich man become\r\npoor; whereas the idiot has always been in misfortune and misery.) The\r\ndistinction between the idiot and the insane is clear and marked. The\r\nmadman suffers from abnormal development of brain, the idiot from an\r\nill-developed brain--the mind of the madman is not in proper balance,\r\nin the idiot it is not in proper power.\r\n\r\nThe poor idiot (the word being derived from the Greek ιδιοτης[4]) is\r\nalone in the world; isolated as it were from the rest of nature, he\r\nsees but does not perceive, he hears but does not understand or\r\nappreciate; the organs of sight and hearing may be perfect and yet\r\nuseless; the impressions formed upon the optic and auditory nerves are\r\nduly transmitted to the sensorium, but no idea is there excited; he\r\ncares for nothing, and is alike indifferent to the grandeur as to the\r\nbeauties of Nature; he stands unmoved at the thunder clap, the foam of\r\nthe rushing cataract, or the roar of the mighty ocean; he heeds not\r\nthe hum of the insect world or the song of the early lark, that winged\r\nchorister of the air; the star-bejewelled canopy of heaven, the\r\nmountain landscape lighted up with all the purple splendour of the\r\nsetting sun, all these are nothing to him--he is a soul shut up in\r\nimperfect organs.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See an interesting article on Idiocy, by Dr. Langdon Down,\r\n\"Quain's Dictionary of Medicine.\" Vol. I., p. 926.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Idiocy and Imbecility,\" by W.W. Ireland, M.D. P. 36.\r\n\r\n[3] I am glad to find that this question of the depletion of our\r\nworkhouses is engaging the attention of Boards of Guardians, as shown\r\nby a meeting lately held in Norwich, to consider the propriety of\r\nreducing the number of workhouses in the district. At this conference,\r\nwhich was attended by delegates from various unions, Mr. Bartle H.T.\r\nFrere stated that the Aylsham workhouse, originally built for 619\r\npersons, had never had more than 117 inmates during the past eleven\r\nyears; and that in other unions, not more than a quarter of the actual\r\nworkhouse accommodation was utilized, although a complete staff of\r\nofficials was kept in each union. Mr. Frere pointed out the folly of\r\nkeeping up such elaborate machinery, for such totally inadequate\r\nresults, and that an enormous saving would be effected by the\r\namalgamation of two or more unions for the purpose of housing their\r\npauper population.\r\n\r\n[4] This term is applied by the Greek writers to a person unpractised\r\nor unskilled in anything--one who has no professional knowledge,\r\nwhether of politics or any other subject, and it seems to have\r\ncorresponded with our word layman; thus, Thucydides, in describing the\r\nplague that broke out at Athens during the Peloponnesian War, in\r\nspeaking of a physician and a layman, uses the phrase ιατρος καἱ\r\nἱσιωτης; Plato also uses the word in the same sense (Legg. 933 D), and\r\nthe same author, in contrasting a poet with a prose-writer, uses the\r\nphrase, \"εν μéτρω ὡς ποιητης, ἡ ἁνευ μéτρου ὡς ιδιωτης\" (Phaedr. 258\r\nD). I doubt very much the appropriateness of the word idiot as applied\r\nto these unfortunate creatures, and I think the American term of\r\nFeeble-minded more correctly represents their condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF IDIOCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be utterly impossible in the short time allotted to me, to\r\nenter at any length upon the various causes of idiocy, a study of\r\nwhich is, however, fraught with many a useful lesson. Suffice it to\r\nsay that as the cause is always antecedent to any personal history of\r\nthe child, idiocy is never dependent on the idiot himself, who has\r\nnever become so through any vices of his own; he being in many\r\ninstances the feeble expression of parental defects, and sometimes of\r\nparental vices, and is therefore more an object for commiseration than\r\ncertain lunatics, who, in many instances, have become so through\r\nfaults of their own. As to the social aspect of idiocy, it recognises\r\nno distinction of rank; it may occur in the homes of the affluent, or\r\nin the hovels of the most indigent. It is found in all civilised\r\ncountries, but it is not an evil necessarily inherent in society, and\r\nis the result of the violation of natural laws, in some way or other,\r\nand at some time or other, and the effect may not show itself for two\r\nor three generations. A very large class of persons ignore the\r\nconditions upon which health and reason can co-exist; they pervert the\r\nnatural appetites of the body, and the natural emotions of the mind,\r\nand thus bring down the awful consequences of their own ignorance upon\r\nthe heads of their unoffending children.\r\n\r\nIdiocy may be a congenital infirmity, or may be developed in early\r\ninfancy. In the first category, the cause must necessarily be traced\r\nto intra-uterine life, and must be sought for in the history of the\r\nparents; in the second class, the cause may sometimes depend upon\r\nparental defects, and sometimes is due to a cerebral affection\r\noccurring soon after birth, but even in this class of cases,\r\nhereditary predisposition must be considered as a powerful factor in\r\nthe genesis of the disease. In fact, the development of idiocy,\r\nwhether congenital or otherwise, is in most instances to be attributed\r\nto an hereditary morbid vice, and it is one of the most common and\r\nstriking forms of the degeneration of the human species.\r\n\r\nHereditary tendencies have much to do with the development of physical\r\ndefects and bodily ailments, and this result is especially apparent\r\nin diseases of the nervous system; and there can be no doubt that\r\nheredity is a potent factor in the production of idiocy. Dr. Ireland\r\nsays, \"idiocy is, of all mental derangements, the most frequently\r\npropagated by descent;\" and the statistics of Ludwig Dahl, of\r\nChristiana, showed that fifty per cent. of idiots had insane\r\nrelations, those of Dr. Fletcher Beach showed a history of hereditary\r\npredisposition in 76 per cent., whilst those of Moreau, of Tours, give\r\na proportion as high as 90 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn thus expressing myself, I should be sorry that my remarks should be\r\nconstrued as intended to cast any imputation upon those who have\r\nunfortunately an idiot in their family; the cause of the evil may be\r\nin some remote progenitor, for the transmission of the infirmity is\r\nnot always direct, and the neurotic tendency may skip a generation, or\r\nbe traced even further back.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intemperance._ One of the most fruitful causes of idiocy is the\r\n_abuse_--mark, I do not say the _proper use_--of alcoholic stimulants,\r\nwhich tends to bring families into a low and feeble condition, which\r\nthus becomes a prolific cause of idiocy in their children. From a\r\nreport on idiocy, by Dr. Howe and other Commissioners appointed by the\r\nGovernor of Massachusetts to ascertain the causes of this calamity in\r\nthat State, it is stated that \"out of 359 idiots, the condition of\r\nwhose progenitors was ascertained, 99 were the children of inveterate\r\ndrunkards;\" and the report goes on to say further, \"that when the\r\nparents were not actually habitual drunkards, yet amongst the idiots\r\nof the lower class, not one quarter of the parents could be considered\r\nas temperate persons. From a table drawn up by the late Dr. Kerlin, an\r\nAmerican physician, in which the causes of the infirmity are given in\r\n100 cases of idiotic children, I observe that in 38 of the number,\r\nintemperance on the part of the parents is traced as an accessory,\r\nmain, direct, or indirect cause.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the British Medical Association, held at\r\nCambridge, Dr. Fletcher Beach read a paper on the Intemperance of\r\nParents as a predisposing cause of idiocy in children. In 430\r\npatients, he was enabled to trace a history of parental intemperance\r\nin 138 cases, or 31·6 per cent.; of this number, 72 were males and 66\r\nfemales.\"[5]\r\n\r\nOther observers lay less stress upon parental intemperance as a cause\r\nof idiocy. Dr. Wilbur found that out of 365 cases in the State of\r\nIllinois, only eight cases were assigned to the abuse of drink in the\r\nparents; and Dr. Shuttleworth could trace this cause in only 16·38 per\r\ncent. of the cases observed by himself and by Dr. Fletcher Beach;[6]\r\nthe same writer, under the head of toxic idiocy, mentions the case of\r\nan idiot boy, who was said to have been brought up on porter instead\r\nof milk. It will therefore be seen that there exists a great\r\ndifference of opinion about the influence of intemperance of the\r\nparent in the causation of idiocy; but although statistics may vary\r\nupon this point, there cannot be a doubt that the children of drunken\r\nparents inherit an unhealthy nervous system, which in many cases\r\nculminates in idiocy.\r\n\r\nIdiocy is especially prevalent in Norway, and Ludwig Dahl, a Norwegian\r\nwriter, says that to the abuse of brandy, especially in the fathers,\r\nbut also in the mothers during pregnancy, may be assigned an\r\nimportant, perhaps the most important, influence in the production of\r\nthe large number of idiots in that country.\r\n\r\nIn considering this question, we must bear in mind that intemperance\r\nis only a relative term; for in the early part of the century we read\r\nof our ancestors indulging in a bottle of port wine to each\r\nindividual, without, it seems, incurring the charge of drunkenness.\r\nThere cannot be a doubt, however, that the habitual use of alcohol,\r\nwithout being carried to the extent of actual intoxication, is\r\ncalculated to cause a low and feeble condition of the body, and thus\r\nconduce to the production of idiocy in the offspring; for we may\r\nfairly assume that what too severely tries the nervous system in one\r\ngeneration will appear in their descendants.[7] Without, therefore,\r\nexaggerating the influence of alcohol on the genesis of idiocy, I\r\nthink I shall not be deviating from the path of strict scientific\r\naccuracy, if I say that over indulgence in alcoholic beverages is\r\ncalculated to produce a low state of vitality, and a degeneration of\r\nnerve tissue which may culminate in the development of idiocy in\r\nsubsequent generations.[8]\r\n\r\nJust now that the attention of the Legislature is being prominently\r\ncalled to the treatment of habitual drunkards, it cannot be too widely\r\nknown that their innocent offspring are but too frequently the victims\r\nof the brutish excesses of their parents, who, a few years ago, were\r\nwell described by the then Secretary of State for the Home Department,\r\nwhen receiving a deputation on the subject, as not quite criminals nor\r\nquite lunatics, although nearly approaching both classes in many\r\ncases. The above statistics fully corroborate the pertinency of Lord\r\nCross's remarks.\r\n\r\nI do not allude to these facts with the view of casting any reflection\r\nupon the poor, honest, and temperate East Anglian labourer, who may be\r\nafflicted with the calamity of having an idiot child; but I merely\r\nmention them in order that they may serve as an additional caution\r\nagainst habits of intemperance, and may strengthen the hands of that\r\nnoble band of philanthropists who are endeavouring to check the\r\ntorrent of this hideous vice so prevalent in the present day.\r\n\r\n_Consanguine Marriages._ There is no point connected with the\r\ncausation of idiocy that has given rise to so much controversy as the\r\nmarriage of near relations; formerly one of the most popular notions\r\nwas that consanguineous marriages were among the most common causes of\r\nidiocy, whereas the researches of later observers have tended to\r\nmodify, to a considerable extent, this sweeping assertion.\r\n\r\nDifferent observers have furnished different results, as to the\r\nproportion of idiots found to be the offspring of consanguine\r\nmarriages; thus Dr. Grabham's statistics give the proportion as about\r\n2 per cent., Dr. Langdon Down's rather more than 5 per cent., and Dr.\r\nShuttleworth's less than 5 per cent. The statistics of the Eastern\r\nCounties' Asylum, kindly supplied to me by Mr. Turner, the Resident\r\nSuperintendent, show that about 6·5 per cent. were the offspring of\r\ncousins.\r\n\r\nOf 359 cases observed by Dr. Howe, 17 were known to be the children of\r\nparents nearly related in blood. The history of these 17 families, the\r\nheads of which being blood relatives intermarried, showed that there\r\nwere other causes to increase the chances of an infirm offspring,\r\nbesides that of intermarriages, as most of the parents were\r\nintemperate or scrofulous; some were both the one and the other. There\r\nwere born unto them 95 children, of whom 44 were idiotic, 12 others\r\nwere scrofulous and puny, one was deaf, and one was a dwarf! In one\r\nfamily of 8 children, 5 were idiotic.[9]\r\n\r\nDr. Ireland, who has investigated this point with great minuteness,\r\npertinently remarks that it has been the custom to collect instances\r\nof cousins who have married, and have had unhealthy children, as if\r\nthis never happened to anyone else; and he adds that \"the proper way\r\nto examine the question clearly, is to find what is the proportion of\r\nmarriages of blood relations in a given population, and then to\r\ninquire if there be in the issue of such marriages a larger percentage\r\nof insane, idiotic, or otherwise unhealthy children.\"[10]\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a doubt that consanguinity has hitherto been\r\nconsidered too great a factor in the production of idiocy, and that in\r\nweighing the evidence, we must not lose sight of the fact that in many\r\ncases recorded, other factors beside intermarriage of relatives have\r\ncontributed concurrently to the development of the mental defect.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Educational Overpressure._ There is one cause of idiocy which has\r\nbeen pointed out by Dr. Séguin, and which he says is due to the\r\nunsatisfactory social conditions under which women of the present day\r\nexist. \"As soon,\" he says, \"as women assumed the anxieties pertaining\r\nto both sexes, they gave birth to children whose like had hardly been\r\nmet with thirty years ago.\"[12]\r\n\r\nGreat prominence has lately been given to this subject by an oration\r\non \"Sex in Education,\" by Sir James Crichton Browne, at the Medical\r\nSociety of London, in which he called attention to the \"growing\r\ntendency to ignore intellectual distinctions between the sexes, to\r\nassimilate the education of girls to that of boys, and to throw men\r\nand women into industrial competition in every walk of life.\"\r\nElsewhere, he adds, that \"to throw women into competition with men is\r\nto insure to them a largely increased liability to organic nervous\r\ndisease.... Woe betide the generation that springs from mothers\r\namongst whom gross nervous degenerations abound.\" Sir J.C. Browne\r\nsupports his views by showing that there are organic cerebral\r\ndifferences between men and women, and that therefore they must be\r\neducated in different ways, being destined to play different parts on\r\nthe stage of human life.[13]\r\n\r\nThe above views of Sir J.C. Browne have not remained unchallenged, and\r\nthe eminent psychologist has found uncompromising opponents in Mrs.\r\nGarrett Anderson and others, who stoutly refuse to recognise the\r\nposition of the \"_Tacens et placens uxor_\" of old-time dreams. Mrs.\r\nAnderson, who, I need scarcely add, writes most temperately upon this\r\nmatter, in alluding to Sir J.C. Browne's assumption of the\r\nintellectual difference between men and women, remarks, \"All I would\r\nventure to say is that, if it could be proved that an average man\r\ndiffers from an average woman as much as Newton differed from a\r\ncretin, it would still be well to give the cretin all the training\r\nwhich he was capable of receiving.... When we hear it said that women\r\nwill cease to be womanly if they enter professions or occasionally\r\nvote in parliamentary elections, we think that those who conjure up\r\nthese terrors should try to understand women better, and should rid\r\nthemselves of the habit of being frightened about nothing.\"[14]\r\n\r\nThe limits of this essay will not permit me to dwell at any great\r\nlength on the important question under consideration. There cannot be\r\na doubt that the tendency of the present age is to encourage women to\r\nchoose careers and to accept burdens unfitted for them. In thus\r\nexpressing myself, I distinctly deprecate any hostility to the woman's\r\nmovement of the present day, which rests on the claim for women for an\r\nopen career; and I should be glad to see our universities ignore the\r\nancient and exploded prejudices, which led to the long subjection of\r\nwomen to hardship and inequality. They ask for the same facilities as\r\nare enjoyed by men, and they have amply shown that they can compete\r\nwith men in intellectual pursuits, and all they ask is to be allowed\r\nto compete on equal terms. I therefore cordially welcome the gradual\r\nemancipation of women from comparative subjection to comparative\r\nfreedom; but the multifarious fields of energy and usefulness open to\r\nmodern women, have brought with them disadvantages as well as gains.\r\n\r\nWhilst, therefore, unreservedly admitting the claims of the _fin de\r\nsiècle_ woman to freedom of action and to intellectual equality, I\r\nmust think there are certain branches of study, described by a modern\r\nwriter as belonging to the \"gynagogue\" class, which are less suited to\r\nwomen than some others; and amongst these, I would name the abstruse\r\nstudy of mathematics, for although success in this branch of knowledge\r\nmay lead to a brilliant career as a high wrangler, I think that a\r\nfemale mathematical athlete is not suited for the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of maternity, and that the mental endowments of her\r\nchildren are likely to be below the average.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that I am treading on dangerous and delicate ground,\r\nbut although I would not discourage the highest aspirations of women,\r\nwhether of an intellectual, social, or æsthetic character, I must\r\nthink that a word of caution is necessary against the overpressure of\r\nthe present day in the direction above indicated.[15] With every\r\ndesire to treat this question from a liberal point of view, I desire\r\nto emphasise the fact that men and women have different parts to play\r\non the stage of life, and should be trained differently; but provided\r\nmental overpressure is guarded against, I have no fear of women\r\nengaging in certain occupations which custom has not hitherto\r\nrecognised as feminine, and experience has shown us that they may be\r\nsafely left to follow the promptings of their own powers and\r\ninstincts.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmongst the various other predispositions to idiocy, I would mention\r\nscrofula, which, according to Dr. Ireland, is the remote cause of\r\ntwo-thirds of all cases; phthisis and epilepsy in the parents are also\r\npotent factors in the development of idiocy in their offspring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the question of the cause of idiocy, I should like to\r\nsay a word or two about what is technically called its histology and\r\nits pathological anatomy. What is there in the brain that makes one\r\nman a senior wrangler and another an idiot? What is it that unfits one\r\nperson for the discharge of the ordinary duties of domestic and social\r\nlife, and endows another with capacities adapted for a statesman, a\r\nmathematician, or a philosopher? Is it a defect in the quantity or in\r\nthe quality of the nervous matter of the brain? Does it depend on a\r\nmalformation of the cranium, on the size or shape of the head? does\r\nthe form of a cranium illustrate the quality of the mind whose\r\ncerebral substratum it encloses, or can genius of a high order\r\nenshrine itself in a comparatively narrow and malconstructed\r\ntenement?[16] Does mental capacity depend on the size or weight of the\r\nbrain, or on the degree of complexity of the cerebral convolutions, or\r\non their symmetry in each hemisphere?[17] Upon this point, I am bound\r\nto tell you that science speaks with a somewhat uncertain sound,\r\nvolumes having been written upon it without any definite solution or\r\ntangible result.\r\n\r\nAn eminent Italian psychologist, Dr. Mingazzini, in a recent work on\r\nthe study of the cerebral convolutions, shows that in men of genius,\r\nthe brain offers no certain indications of intellectual eminence,\r\neither by the greater richness of the frontal or the parietal lobes;\r\nand in support of this opinion he cites the researches of Wagner,\r\nwhich showed that, in the development and richness of the\r\nconvolutions, the brains of many celebrated Gottingen professors were\r\ninferior to those belonging to individuals of low intellectual\r\ncapacity.[18]\r\n\r\nThe average brain weight in man may be said to range from 40 to 52-1/2\r\nounces, and in women from 35 to 37-1/2 ounces; the question of the\r\nincrease in size and weight of the brain, in proportion to\r\nintellectual power, is by no means determined; statistics exist of the\r\nweight of 23 eminent men, the list being headed by Cuvier, the\r\nnaturalist, whose brain weighed 64-1/2 ounces, whilst that of the\r\norator, Gambetta, weighed only 39 ounces, being much below the average\r\nweight in the adult male; an imbecile died at the Montrose Asylum,\r\nwhose brain weighed 63 ounces, and the heaviest brain on record, which\r\nweighed 67 ounces, was that of a bricklayer, who could neither read\r\nnor write; it must therefore be conceded that no definite statement\r\ncan be made as to the relation that brain weight has to\r\nintelligence.[19]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that idiots always presented some obvious\r\nmalformation of the cranium or skull. This is by no means necessarily\r\nthe case; one of the most remarkable cases of idiocy that has come\r\nunder my notice was that of a child with a well-formed head,\r\nremarkably handsome face, and a well-proportioned body.\r\n\r\nDr. Ireland says, \"the principal anomalies met with in the skull of\r\ngenetic idiots are flatness of the head behind, a rapid\r\nslope of the clivus, an osseous rim round the foramen magnum,\r\nunsymmetrical size of the cavities on each side, irregularities in the\r\nwings of the sphenoid, and differences in the size and shape of the\r\njugular and other foramina; but these appearances are not constant,\r\nand often the skull is quite regular, both in structure and\r\ncapacity.\"[20]\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted writers on the subject, after stating that a\r\nnumber of scientific men had spent thirty years in measuring and\r\nweighing the heads of idiots, sums up their conclusions as follows:--\r\n\r\n1st. There is no constant relation between the development of the\r\ncranium and the degree of intelligence.\r\n\r\n2nd. The dimensions of the anterior part of the cranium, and\r\nespecially of the forehead, are, at least, as great among idiots as\r\nothers.[21]\r\n\r\n3rd. Three-fifths of idiots have larger heads than men of ordinary\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n4th. There is no constant relation between the degree of intelligence\r\nand the weight of the brain.[22]\r\n\r\n5th. Sometimes the brain of idiots presents no deviation in form,\r\ncolour, and density from the normal standard; it is, in fact,\r\nperfectly normal.\r\n\r\nAfter such a statement as this, I can readily imagine that some of you\r\nmay say, it seems to us that you doctors really know but little about\r\nthe genesis of idiocy. I am afraid this is, to some extent, true. We\r\nare only on the threshold of inquiry, and science of to-day is unable\r\nto bridge over the gulf that separates matter from mind.\r\n\r\nModern investigation, however, does not quite bear out the above\r\nsweeping statements in their integrity, although the most conflicting\r\ntheories have been enunciated. Doubtless, attention has been too much\r\nconcentrated on the gross morphology of the brain, without taking into\r\naccount microscopical appearances. Dr. Shuttleworth, in giving the\r\nresult of his long experience at the Royal Albert Asylum says, \"We\r\nhave occasionally found, when least expected, extraordinary defects in\r\nbrain conformation;... microscopic examination will discover in many\r\ninstances some abnormality of structure, such as the preponderance of\r\nsimply formed braincells devoid of processes, denoting persistence of\r\nfœtal structures; or, on the other hand, degenerative changes\r\nresulting from inflammatory atrophy.\"[23]\r\n\r\nProfessor Luys, of Paris,[24] gives the result of the examination of\r\nthe brain of 14 idiots, the anomalies observed being want of symmetry\r\nin the frontal lobes, and partial atrophy of the cortical folds\r\nespecially of the frontal convolutions.[25]\r\n\r\nQuite recently, Dr. Andriessen, at a meeting of the Leeds and West\r\nRiding Medico-Chirurgical Society, exhibited specimens of the brains\r\nof epileptic idiots, which showed conditions of microgyria with\r\natrophy and sclerosis of the convolutions.\r\n\r\nIn considering the pathology of idiocy, I think sufficient attention\r\nhas not been given to the chemical constitution of the cerebral\r\nsubstance. The most extravagant notions were at one time prevalent as\r\nto the rôle played by phosphorus in the animal economy; the Dutch\r\nnaturalist, Moleschott, maintaining that \"without phosphorus there was\r\nno thought.\" A celebrated chemist, Couerbe, also considered\r\nphosphorus to be the exciting principle of the brain, and according to\r\nhim, the brain of ordinary men contained 2-1/2 per cent. of\r\nphosphorus, that of the idiot 1-1/2, and that of the madman 4 to\r\n4-1/2; from these data he concluded, \"that the absence of phosphorus\r\nin the brain reduced man to the condition of the brute; that a great\r\nexcess of this element irritated the nervous system and plunged the\r\nindividual into the frightful delirium which we call madness; and that\r\na medium proportion re-established the equilibrium and produced the\r\nadmirable harmony which is none else than the soul of the\r\nspiritualists.\"[26] Professor Janet, in criticising the above theory,\r\nremarks that the brain of fishes, who do not pass for great thinkers,\r\ncontains a large amount of phosphorus, also that the statistics of M.\r\nLassaigne have shown that the brain of madmen does not contain more\r\nphosphorus than that of sane individuals.[27]\r\n\r\nThe late Bishop of Carlisle, in rebutting this phosphorus theory,\r\nremarks, \"Why should we not go further and assert that there could be\r\nno thought without carbon or without any other element of which the\r\nhuman body is composed; for you can have no actual thought without a\r\nliving creature, and no living creature without a body, and no body\r\nwithout carbon.\"[28]\r\n\r\nI have treated the subject of the Chemistry of the Brain at\r\nconsiderable length in my treatise on \"Aphasia and the Localisation of\r\nArticulate Language,\" to which book I would refer those who desire\r\nfurther information in reference to the connection between the amount\r\nof phosphorus and intellectual vigour.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] The question of the influence of alcoholic stimulants on the\r\ndevelopment of mental disease formed a prominent feature in the\r\nproceedings of this congress, and it is also a subject which is just\r\nnow engaging the attention of pathologists in all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n[6] \"Mentally-deficient Children, their treatment and training.\" By\r\nG.E. Shuttleworth, M.D. Page 36.\r\n\r\n[7] Toussenel, a French writer, says \"La plupart des idiots sont des\r\nenfants procréés dans l'ivresse bacchique. On sait que les enfants se\r\nressentent généralement de l'influence passionelle qui a présidé à\r\nleur conception.\" At a discussion at the Obstetrical Society, Dr.\r\nLangdon Down is reported to have entertained similar views.\r\n\r\n[8] I would refer those who may wish to pursue the inquiry as to the\r\nbaneful influence of alcohol on the human frame, to the celebrated\r\nCantor Lectures on Alcohol, by my friend Sir B.W. Richardson, in which\r\nhe introduces the physiological argument into the temperance cause,\r\nasserting that alcohol cannot be classified as a food; that\r\ndegeneration of tissues is produced, that it neither supplies matter\r\nfor construction nor production of heat, but, on the contrary,\r\nmilitates against both. Sir B.W. Richardson's latest views upon this\r\nsubject are developed in the pages of the \"Hospital\" for February 1st\r\nand March 14th, of this present year.\r\n\r\nIn France, M. Lunier, Inspector of Asylums, has shown that the\r\ndepartments in which the consumption of alcohol had increased most,\r\nwere those in which there had been a corresponding increase of\r\ninsanity, and this was shown most strikingly in regard to women, at\r\nthe period when the natural wines of the country gave way to the\r\nconsumption of spirits.\r\n\r\nIn Sweden, Dr. Westfelt has lately made a communication to the\r\nStockholm Medical Society, containing the statistics of alcoholic\r\nabuse and its results in Sweden. He calculates that at least from 7 to\r\n12 or 13 per cent. among males, and from 1 to 2 per cent. among\r\nfemales, of all cases of acquired insanity, are due to the abuse of\r\nalcohol; and in reference to its influence on progeny and race, he\r\nshows that a steady diminution of the population was coincident with a\r\nperiod when drunkenness was at its greatest height.\r\n\r\n[9] \"On the Causes of Idiocy.\" By S.G. Howe, M.D. Page 35.\r\n\r\n[10] \"Op cit,\" page 19.\r\n\r\n[11] That eminent clinical observer, the late Professor Trousseau, in\r\ntreating of the influence of consanguine marriages, gives the history\r\nof a Neapolitan family, in which an uncle married his niece. There had\r\npreviously been no hereditary disease in the family; of the four\r\nchildren, the issue of this marriage, the eldest daughter was very\r\neccentric; the second child, a boy, was epileptic; the third child\r\nvery intelligent; and the fourth was an idiot and epileptic. \"Clinique\r\nMédicale de l'Hôtel-Dieu de Paris.\" Tome ii., page 87.\r\n\r\n[12] \"New Facts and Remarks concerning Idiocy,\" by E. Séguin, M.D., p.\r\n28. Dr. Séguin has been a voluminous contributor to the literature of\r\nIdiocy, and for many years his writings were the only available source\r\nof information on the management and education of idiots.\r\n\r\n[13] Sir J.C. Browne, in speaking of the brain of men and women, says\r\nthere can be no question of inferiority or superiority between them\r\nany more than there can be between a telescope and a microscope; but\r\nthey are differentiated from each other in structure and function, and\r\nfitted to do different kinds of work in the world. He maintains that\r\nthe weight of the brain is less in women than in men, that the\r\nspecific gravity of the grey matter is less, that the distribution of\r\nthe blood varies in the two sexes to a considerable extent, and that\r\nthe blood going to the female brain is somewhat poorer in quality than\r\nthat going to the male brain, and contains four millions and a half\r\ncorpuscles to the cubic millimetre, instead of five millions in the\r\ncase of the male.\r\n\r\n[14] It seems that one of their own sex is of a different opinion, as\r\nin a series of articles in the \"Nineteenth Century\" for 1891 and 1892,\r\nMrs. Lynn Linton strongly deprecates any departure from the\r\ncomparatively restricted area of usefulness hitherto open to women,\r\nand she even baldly states that it is for maternity that women\r\nprimarily exist! She also adds, \"be it pleasant or unpleasant, it is\r\nnone the less an absolute truth--the _raison d'être_ of a woman is\r\nmaternity ... the cradle lies across the door of the polling booth and\r\nbars the way to the senate.\"\r\n\r\nIn a powerful article in the same serial, entitled \"Defence of the\r\nso-called Wild Women,\" Mrs. Mona Caird severely criticises Mrs. Lynn\r\nLinton's views as to the restrictions she would impose upon the\r\nfreedom of women to choose their own career.\r\n\r\n[15] Although the injurious effects of overpressure in education have\r\nbeen principally referred to in the education of girls, the same\r\npernicious results may accrue in the case of boys. Dr. Wynn Westcott,\r\nin his work on \"Suicide,\" states that during the last few years there\r\nhave been several English cases of children killing themselves because\r\nunable to perform school tasks. He also says that child-suicide is\r\nincreasing in England and in almost all Continental states, and that\r\nthe cause in many cases is due to overpressure in education. Dr.\r\nStrahan, writing upon the same subject, in his treatise on \"Suicide\r\nand Insanity,\" corroborates Dr. Westcott's views, and remarks that\r\nfifty years ago, child-suicide was comparatively rare; but that during\r\nthe last quarter of a century it has steadily increased in all\r\nEuropean states, and that the high-pressure system of education is\r\ngenerally considered as the cause of it.\r\n\r\nIf any apology be needed for dwelling at such length on the evils of\r\nthe educational overpressure so prevalent in our days, I would observe\r\nthat it has an indirect bearing upon the causation of idiocy; for\r\nalthough the sinister results recorded by Drs. Westcott and Strahan\r\nmay be comparatively rare, still, consequences of a more remote\r\ncharacter may ensue, for the injury done to the nervous system is\r\ncumulative and transmissible from generation to generation, and a\r\nneurotic tendency may be engendered in the offspring of those who have\r\nbeen exposed to this evil, which may manifest itself in the appearance\r\nof idiocy or some lesser form of mental defect.\r\n\r\n[16] One of the most distinguished French psychologists, has thus\r\nexpressed himself on this point--\"Dans des réunions ou l'idiotisme\r\nétendait son triste niveau, il m'est arrivé plusieurs fois de\r\nrencontrer des crânes, qui dans leur partie frontale eussent fait\r\nhonneur aux hommes les plus justement célèbres, et où l'on eût pu\r\ntrouver avec avantage les organes de toutes les sortes d'esprit, de\r\ncelui même qui apprend à rire des mystifications et des sots.\"--_Rejet\r\nde l'Organologie Phrénologique_, par F. Lelut, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[17] Dr. Wilmath, of the Pennsylvania Institution for Feeble-minded,\r\nreports that in six brains the island of Reil was exposed through\r\ndefective development of the 3rd frontal convolution; in four cases,\r\non both sides; in two cases, on one side only.--_Notes on the\r\nPathology of Idiocy._\r\n\r\n[18] Il Cervello in Relazione con i Fenomeni Psichici. Studio sulla\r\nmorfologia degli emisferi cerebrali dell'uomo, Torino, 1895. P. 89.\r\n\r\nThis is a work of great merit, in which the author compares the\r\nstructure of the brain of man with that of other primates; he then\r\ntreats of the morphology of the brain in different races, in\r\ncriminals, in the insane, in deaf mutes, and in microcephales. An\r\nextremely interesting chapter is that devoted to the assumed\r\ndifference of the cerebral hemispheres in the two sexes, containing\r\nstatistical tables constructed by Dr. Mingazzini himself and others.\r\nAlthough he mentions certain minor differences that have been noticed\r\nby different observers, he summarises his own opinion by the statement\r\nthat, \"from the numerous but incomplete observations upon this\r\nsubject, it may be concluded with certainty that essential differences\r\ndo not exist\" (si può inferire quasi con certezza che differenze\r\nessenziali non esistono).\r\n\r\n[19] Further information as to brain weight and cranial capacity, will\r\nbe found in the author's treatise on \"Aphasia and the Localisation of\r\nArticulate Language,\" chapter xii. (_Prize Essay of the Academy of\r\nMedicine of France._)\r\n\r\n[20] Op. cit., page 64.\r\n\r\n[21] The attention of the medical profession has lately been called to\r\nthe obstetric aspect of idiocy, and I would refer those who take an\r\ninterest in this subject to the valuable statistics of Dr. Langdon\r\nDown, which contain the result of his inquiries into the history of\r\n2,000 cases of idiocy that have come under his observation; from which\r\nit would seem that primogeniture plays an important part, as no less\r\nthan 24 per cent. of all the idiot children observed were primiparous.\r\nThe increased difficulty of parturition seemed to be an important\r\nfactor. In reference to the use of the forceps in delivery as an\r\nassigned cause of idiocy, Dr. Down says, \"there is no evidence that\r\ninstrumental interference has any injurious influence on the mental\r\ncondition of the children, but he thinks that those who delay the use\r\nof the forceps incur a much greater risk from the prolongation of\r\npressure, resulting in suspended animation, which condition should be\r\nespecially avoided. Of Dr. Down's 2,000 cases, the ratio of males to\r\nfemales was 2·1 to 0·9. This was probably due to the larger size of\r\nthe head giving rise to the prolonged and difficult parturition,\r\ncontinued pressure, and suspended animation.\"--_Obstetrical Journal_,\r\nvol. iv., p. 681.\r\n\r\n[22] Dr. Hammond, Professor of Diseases of the Nervous System at\r\nBellevue College, New York, has published some interesting statistics\r\nin reference to the relative weight of the brain, as compared with\r\nthat of the body, in various classes of vertebrate animals, by which\r\nhe shows that there is no definite relation between the intelligence\r\nof animals and the absolute or relative size of the brain. Thus, he\r\nsays, \"the canary bird and the Arctic sparrow have brains\r\nproportionately larger than those of any other known animals,\r\nincluding man, and yet no one will contend that these animals stand at\r\nthe top of the scale of mental development. Man, who certainly stands\r\nat the head of the class of mammals, and of all other animals, so far\r\nas mind is concerned, rarely has a brain more than one-fiftieth the\r\nweight of the body, a proportion which is much greater in several\r\nother mammals, and is, as we have seen, exceeded by many of the\r\nsmaller birds.\"\r\n\r\n[23] Clinical Lecture on Idiocy, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[24] L'Encéphale, March 1881, p. 82.\r\n\r\n[25] At a meeting of the Medico-Psychological Society of Paris, my\r\nfriend M. Auguste Voisin exhibited plates of the brains of idiots who\r\nhad only begun to speak at the age of from three to five years, in\r\nwhich the frontal and first parietal convolutions were rectilinear\r\nwithout secondary folds, resembling the fœtal condition of the\r\nconvolutions at the sixth month of intra-uterine life.\r\n\r\n[26] The imagination of certain psychologists seems to have gone\r\nrampant upon this subject; one writer, M. Moreau, of Tours, maintained\r\nthat genius was a nervous disease--\"le génie est une névrose\"; and in\r\norder that there may be no mistake about his meaning, he adds that\r\n\"the constitution of many men of genius is in reality the same as that\r\nof idiots!\" M. Moreau's doctrine may thus be summarised in his own\r\nwords--\"Les dispositions d'esprit qui font qu'un homme se distingue\r\ndes autres hommes par l'originalité de ses pensées et de ses\r\nconceptions, par son excentricité on l'énergie de ses facultés\r\naffectives, par la transcendance de ses facultés intellectuelles,\r\nprennent leur source dans les mêmes conditions organiques que les\r\ndivers troubles moraux, dont _la folie et l'idiotie_ sont l'expression\r\nla plus complète.\"\r\n\r\n[27] Le Cerveau et la Pensée, par Paul Janet Membre de l'Institut.\r\nParis, 1867, p. 58. This learned treatise contains an immense deal of\r\ninformation in reference to the mysterious connection between matter\r\nand mind, and I have found it of great service to me in my\r\npsychological researches.\r\n\r\n[28] \"Nineteenth Century,\" March, 1880, p. 509.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATTER AND MIND.\r\n\r\n  \"Quare frustra sudaverit, qui cœlestia religionis arcana nostræ\r\n  rationi adaptare conabitur.\" _Bacon, \"De Augmentis Scientiarum.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the study of idiocy was of great interest\r\nto the theologian, for I can imagine no more powerful weapon for\r\ncombating the materialistic tendencies of the day than is furnished by\r\na consideration of the natural history of the idiot. This is neither\r\nthe time nor the place for me to enter into the question of the\r\nmysterious connection between matter and mind, a subject which I have\r\ndeveloped at some length in my published works.[29] In my various\r\npublic appeals on behalf of the Asylum for Idiots, I have also usually\r\ntaken the opportunity of pointing out how the experience afforded by\r\nthe study of idiocy is utterly opposed to the extravagant dogmas of\r\nthe materialistic school, and to the crude notions which\r\npseudo-science has engendered; and I have also shown how the results\r\nof idiot training furnish a forcible demonstration of the dualistic\r\ntheory of mind and matter, upon which science reposed till the times\r\nof Spinosa, Laplace, Haeckel, Huxley, and others.\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-philosophers of our time have bewildered the public mind by\r\nthe wild flights of their imagination; thought, the so-called\r\nspiritual attributes of man, are merely a function of brain\r\nprotoplasm; the brain, say they, secretes thought, just as the liver\r\nsecretes bile, or as oxygen and sulphur produce sulphuric acid, and\r\nall the varied phenomena of nature are nothing more than the molecular\r\nchanges of matter; the operations of the mind are but the products of\r\nthe caudate cells of the brain, and volition and consciousness are\r\nmere physical manifestations. They see only the physio-chemical side\r\nof nature, they utterly ignore any spiritual attribute in man, they\r\nregard metaphysics as a relic of mediæval superstition, and they\r\nassert that all mental operations are bodily functions, and simply the\r\nresult of some molecular or atomic change in the brain; indeed, the\r\nGerman philosophers go so far as to say that life itself is only a\r\n\"special and most complicated act of mechanics;\"[30] that there is no\r\nreal distinction between living and dead matter, and that vitality is\r\na metaphysical ghost (_ein metaphysisches Gespenst_).[31]\r\n\r\nAt the International Psychological Congress held in Paris, in 1878, at\r\nwhich it was my privilege to be present, Professor Mierzejewski, of\r\nSt. Petersburg, laid before the congress the result of his elaborate\r\nexperiments on the brains of idiots, his communication being\r\nillustrated by casts of the brains of idiots, and also of certain\r\nanimals, and the learned Russian professor's conclusions strongly\r\nmilitated against the theories of the philosophers of whom I have been\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the great value and import of Dr.\r\nMierzejewski's investigations, I must remind you that the human brain\r\nis composed of two kinds of nerve structure, of an essentially\r\ndifferent nature, grey matter and white matter. Examined\r\nmicroscopically, the grey matter is found to be composed of cells,\r\nwhile the white matter consists of fibres; their function also is\r\ndifferent, the former being regarded as the generator of nerve force,\r\nwhile the latter simply serves as the medium by which this force is\r\ntransmitted. As the manifestation of the intellectual powers is\r\nsupposed to be in some way connected with the development of the grey\r\nmatter of the cerebral convolutions, one would expect to find in\r\nidiots a deficiency of this element of brain tissue.[32] Dr.\r\nMierzejewski maintained that this is by no means the case, and he\r\nmentioned an instance of an idiot in whose brain the surface of grey\r\nmatter was enormous. So it would seem that there is no fixed relation\r\nbetween the amount of grey matter of the brain and intellectual power,\r\nfor richness of grey substance and abundance of nerve cells may be\r\naccompanied by idiocy.\r\n\r\nNow, as these startling statements of the Russian professor were not\r\nmade in a hole and corner, but were enunciated in the presence of\r\nleading psychologists from all parts of the world, I felt myself\r\njustified in telling the materialists that they must be faced, and\r\neither answered or admitted as correct; and as my comments upon these\r\nexperiments were subsequently published in a leading London periodical\r\nand widely circulated, I am now justified in assuming that the\r\ninferences I then drew from these remarkable experiments cannot be\r\ncontroverted, and that the time has not yet arrived when the broad\r\ndistinctions between mind and matter are to be obliterated, and man\r\nreduced to a mere automaton, a creature of a blind necessity.\r\n\r\nWithout unduly exaggerating the importance of Dr. Mierzejewski's\r\nexperiments, it must be admitted that very great interest attaches to\r\nthem at this juncture, when attention is so widely directed to the\r\nmysterious connection between matter and mind. Unhappily, instead of\r\nsolving the question, the Russian professor's researches tend to\r\nshroud it in a still deeper mystery, and show that what has been\r\ntermed the \"slippery force of thought--the _vis vivida animæ_\"--cannot\r\nbe weighed in the balance; and they fully justify the eloquent\r\nlanguage of a recent writer when he says, \"Far more transcendent than\r\nall the glories of the universe is the mind of man. Mind is indeed an\r\nenigma, the solution of which is apparently beyond the reach of this\r\nvery mind, itself the problem, the demonstrator, the demonstration,\r\nand the demonstrants.\"\r\n\r\nThose who maintain that the brain is the organ of the mind, do not\r\ntell us what we are to understand by organ, brain, or mind; they seem\r\nto me to confound two things, the one with the other. In fact, they\r\nmake no distinction between thought, mind, consciousness, and the\r\n_instrument_ by which these attributes become externally manifested.\r\nIt is true, we have no evidence to show that the mind can operate\r\nindependently of the nervous system; on the contrary, all\r\nphysiological data bearing upon the question of this mutual relation,\r\ngo to prove that where there is no nervous system there are no mental\r\nmanifestations. Moreover, as G.H. Lewes says, \"It is the man, and not\r\nthe brain, that thinks: it is the organism as a whole, and not one\r\norgan, that feels and acts.\"[33]\r\n\r\nEvery faculty manifests itself by means of matter, but it is important\r\nnot to confound the faculty with the corporeal organ upon which the\r\nexternal manifestation of such faculty depends. The word organ is the\r\nname given to a part of the human frame by which we have sensation,\r\nand by means of which we do a certain act or work; such are the organs\r\nof sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. All these organs are\r\npassive, and require to be operated on _ab extra_, precisely in the\r\nsame way as the musical organ, which is an instrument constructed by\r\nman, requires man's interference for the production of musical sounds.\r\n\r\nWhen a musician sits down to a piano, the music cannot be said to be\r\nin the instrument, but in the soul of the performer. If the instrument\r\nbe in good order, the inspiration of a Thalberg or of a Liszt will\r\nbecome apparent; break the cords or otherwise damage the instrument,\r\nand nothing but discordant strains are produced, the musical faculty\r\nof the performer, however, remaining unaffected. We are all familiar\r\nwith Plato's celebrated dialogue on the Immortality of the Soul, where\r\na disputant with Socrates inquires if the soul is not like the\r\nharmony of a lyre, more beautiful, more divine than the lyre itself,\r\nbut yet is nothing without the lyre, vanishing when this instrument is\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nLet me further illustrate this point by an allusion to the electric\r\ntelegraph, by means of which ideas and words are transmitted from mind\r\nto mind with a rapidity to which ordinary language cannot attain. Now,\r\nthe electrical battery may be not inaptly compared to the brain, and\r\nthe telegraph wires to the nerves which emanate from it. If the\r\nbattery be out of order, or the telegraph wires be broken, this\r\nlightning language, by which mind speaks to mind, becomes impossible.\r\nIn the same way, idiocy may be considered as a disease of the\r\ninstrument rather than of the performer; the idiot's brain is damaged\r\nand has become an unfit instrument for the outward manifestation of\r\nthe powers of the mind, but the lowest idiot possesses the germs of\r\nintellectual activity and moral responsibility; and within his\r\nmalconstructed organism, there lies concealed in its fragile, fleshly\r\ncasket, a precious jewel of immortality--an imperishable essence that\r\nis destined to live on for ever and for aye, through countless æons of\r\ntime, when the dicta of these dreamers of whom I have been speaking,\r\nto use the language of one of them, \"shall have melted away like\r\nstreaks of morning cloud into the infinite azure of the past.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat it, we must take care not to confound the organ with the\r\nperson who possesses this organ: the eye is not that which sees, it is\r\nonly the organ by which we see; the ear is not that which hears, it is\r\nonly the organ by which we hear. Precisely in the same way and in the\r\nsame sense, the brain is the organ of mind, the organ by which our\r\nmental faculties become _externally_ manifested. That it cannot be\r\notherwise is shewn by the results of memory. The brain is of a\r\nperishable nature, its atoms are constantly changing; the body is\r\ncontinually throwing off old particles and appropriating new ones,\r\nevery breath that is drawn, and every exertion that is made, cause\r\nsome minute change in the bodily frame-work, so that it is never\r\nentirely the same;[34] there is no person, therefore, who has the same\r\nbrain that he had 20 years ago; and the vivid impressions of the past\r\nare utterly inexplicable on the supposition that mental activity is a\r\nmere function of any perishable organ like the brain, but they\r\nnecessitate the conclusion that mind and body, spirit and matter, are\r\ntwo entirely heterogeneous substances, and that mind--the concrete\r\n_Ego_--is independent of the material organ by which its external\r\nmanifestation is alone possible.[35]\r\n\r\nHowever tempting it might be, I feel I must not trespass any further\r\nby dwelling on the mysterious connection between matter and mind, a\r\nsubject the complete comprehension of which is beyond the limits of\r\nour finite capacities. As Goethe philosophically remarks, \"We are\r\neternally in contact with problems. Man is an obscure being, he knows\r\nlittle of the world, and of himself least of all.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the great Roman orator, nearly 2,000 years ago,\r\nwith prescient eye, foresaw the attempts that would hereafter be made\r\nto pry into the hidden mysteries of Nature, when he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Latent ista omnia, Luculle, crassis occultata et circumfusa tenebris,\r\nut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, quæ penetrare in cœlum,\r\nterra intrare possit.\"\r\n\r\nThese lines of Cicero would seem to be peculiarly applicable to\r\ncertain modern philosophers, who, in their attempts to bridge over the\r\ngulf--the impassable gulf--which separates matter from mind,\r\npersistently ignore the fact that there are certain things which, from\r\ntheir very nature, are beyond the pale of precise knowledge, and which\r\ncannot be determined by physical investigation--which, in fact, lie\r\noutside the sphere of man's intellect. I believe the question I am\r\ndiscussing is one of these, and that, although we may grope with the\r\ntaper of science into the dark caverns whence seem to issue the\r\nsprings of humanity, we shall probably fail to understand the\r\nmysterious connection between matter and mind, a theme essentially\r\nbeyond the grasp of human intelligence, and which cannot be fathomed\r\nby the puny plummet of human thought or touch.\r\n\r\nThe study of the idiot is calculated to elucidate this overwhelmingly\r\nimportant subject, and I believe the Idiot Asylum is destined to\r\nbecome the arena and battlefield on which this great question will\r\nhave to be fought out.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] \"Darwinism Tested by Language,\" Rivington, 1877; \"Aphasia or Loss\r\nof Speech, and the Localisation of the Faculty of Language,\" 2nd\r\nedition, Churchills, 1890. The reader is referred to these treatises,\r\nand especially to his work on Darwinism, for a fuller exposition of\r\nthe author's views, here only incidentally sketched; and also for a\r\nmore complete knowledge of the scientific facts and different\r\nauthorities quoted in support of the position here taken in reference\r\nto the connection between Matter and Mind.\r\n\r\n[30] \"Das Leben ist nur ein besonderer, und zwar der complicirteste\r\nAct der Mechanik; ein Theil der Gesammtmaterie tritt von Zeit zu Zeit\r\naus dem gewöhnlichen Gange ihrer Bewegungen heraus in besondre\r\norganisch-chemische Verbindungen, und nachdem er eine Zeit\r\nlang darin verharrt hat, kehrt er weider zu den allgemeinen\r\nBewegungsverhältnissen zurück.\"--\r\n\r\n_Gesammte Abhandlungen zu wissenschaftlicher Medicin_ s. 25.\r\n\r\n[31] One of the leaders of scientific thought in this country tells us\r\nthat \"Life is composed of ordinary matter, differing from it only in\r\nthe manner in which its atoms are aggregated,\" and it has been gravely\r\nstated that the production of man in the chemist's retort may be\r\nrecorded as one of the future discoveries of the age!\r\n\r\nA clever French writer, commenting on these purely hypothetical\r\nstatements of the \"mechanistic school,\" makes the following\r\nappropriate remarks--\r\n\r\n_\"Quand on nous dit que l'organisme des êtres vivants n'est qu'un\r\nlaboratoire où tout se passe en combinaisons et en compositions des\r\néléments matériels primitifs, on oublie que ce laboratoire est habité\r\npar un hôte intime, le principe vital qui ne fait qu'un avec les\r\néléments en fusion.

Vacherot, Revue des Deux\r\nMondes,\"_ 1878.\r\n\r\n[32] In an original and very remarkable essay, entitled \"The Brain not\r\nthe Sole Organ of the Mind,\" Dr. Hammond, of New York, says, \"There is\r\nno exception to the law that mental development is in direct\r\nproportion to the amount of grey matter entering into the composition\r\nof the nervous system of any animal of any kind whatever; and that in\r\nestimating mental power, we should be influenced by the absolute and\r\nrelative quantity of _grey nerve tissue_, in which respect we shall\r\nfind man stands pre-eminent, although, as we have already seen, his\r\nbrain, _as a whole_, is relatively much smaller than that of many\r\nother animals; and it is to this preponderance of grey matter that Man\r\nowes the great mental development which places him so far above all\r\nother living beings. As this grey tissue is not confined to the brain,\r\nbut a large proportion of it is found in the ganglia of the\r\nsympathetic and some other nerves, and as an amount second only to\r\nthat of the brain in quantity--and, indeed, in some animals larger--is\r\npresent as an integral constituent of the spinal cord, Dr. Hammond\r\ninfers, and he cites numerous experiments in support of this\r\ninference, that mental power must be conceded to the spinal cord, and\r\nthat the brain can no longer be considered as the sole organ of the\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n[33] \"The Physical Basis of Mind.\" Page 441.\r\n\r\n[34] The late Bishop of Carlisle illustrates the independence of the\r\nEgo, by an allusion to moral feelings. \"A murderer,\" he says, \"is\r\nconvicted twenty years after the offence had been committed, or he\r\ngives himself up after so many years, because his memory and his\r\nconscience make his life miserable. He has no doubt as to the fact\r\nthat the person who did the deed of darkness years ago, is the same\r\nperson as he who feels the pangs of remorse to-day. Every material\r\nparticle in his body may have changed since then, but there is a\r\ncontinuity in his spiritual being out of which he cannot be argued,\r\neven if any ingenious sophist should attempt the task.\"--_Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, March, 1880, p. 510.\r\n\r\n[35] To those who may wish to pursue this subject further, I recommend\r\na perusal of an essay on \"Materialistic Physiology,\" in the _Journal\r\nof Psychological Medicine_ for April, 1877. In this article, the\r\nwriter, Dr. Winn, seems to share my views as to the paramount\r\nimportance of boldly facing this matter, when he says--\r\n\r\n\"The unphilosophical and extravagant dogma, that matter can think, is\r\nnow so loudly and confidently asserted, and so widely spread by a\r\nnumerous class of medical men and physiologists, both in this country\r\nand abroad, that the time has arrived when a doctrine so fallacious,\r\nand so fraught with danger to the best interests of society, should be\r\nfairly and carefully scrutinised. It is not by mere assertion, or the\r\nuse of obscure and pedantic language, that such a theory can be\r\nestablished; and if it can be shown that the arguments on which it is\r\nbased are shallow and speculative, words can scarcely be found too\r\nstrong to censure the recklessness and folly of those who promulgate\r\nviews so subversive of all morality and religion.\r\n\r\n\"The physicists have utterly failed to establish their position. They\r\nwere asked to prove by inductive reasoning the truth of their theory,\r\nthat the universe is the mere outcome of molecular force, and their\r\ndefence has been clearly proved to be of the most evasive and\r\ninconclusive character.\r\n\r\n\"The doctrines of the modern school of materialistic physiology are\r\npermeating all classes of society, and it is these doctrines, based on\r\nthe assumption that mind is a mere function of the brain--an\r\nassumption that, if true, would reduce man to the level of the beasts\r\nthat perish--that we are offered as a substitute for the belief in the\r\nimmateriality of the mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe essay from which the above quotations are taken is full of sound\r\nand logical reasoning, and the writer's position is not supported by\r\nmere _theoretical statements_, but by arguments drawn from\r\n_well-accredited facts_ in anatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PNEUMA, OR SPIRITUAL ATTRIBUTE OF THE IDIOT.\r\n\r\n    Ὁ δε νους εοικεν εγγινεσθαι ουσια\r\n    τις ουσα, και ου φθειρεσθαι.\r\n\r\n                                Aristot. _De Anima_, I. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the instrument by which the manifestation of mind is alone\r\npossible is undoubtedly damaged in idiots, they were formerly supposed\r\nnot to belong to the human family, and their place in the order of\r\ncreation was disputed. All admitted that they had the σωμα, or\r\nmaterial part of our nature; they also conceded to them the ψυχη, or\r\nprinciple of animal life, but they considered that the πνευμα, or\r\nspirit of immortal life--that which essentially differentiates man\r\nfrom the brute--was absent in the idiot. This idea seemed to have been\r\nentertained by a great theologian of the 16th century, who, on being\r\nasked by a father what he was to do with his idiot boy, replied that\r\nthe child might be drowned as he possessed no soul! Times are happily\r\nchanged. We don't admit the lawfulness of drowning idiots in these\r\ndays, but we teach them to swim against the adverse currents to which\r\nthey are exposed; we buoy them up on the tempestuous waves of life; we\r\npilot them through the rocks and shoals of their ill-starred career\r\ntill their chequered race is run, and they are safely landed in the\r\nhaven of everlasting rest.\r\n\r\nNot only in the 16th century, but certain philosophers of a later date\r\nhave questioned the idiot's place in creation, and have disputed\r\nhis right to be classed among the human family; and some\r\nscientists--believers in the so-called doctrine of Evolution, as\r\napplied to the Descent of Man--have gone so far as to pretend that the\r\nbrain of the microcephalic idiot is so far removed from the human\r\ntype, as to constitute him a connecting link between man and the\r\nanthropoid apes! Now, the interesting results of our training\r\ninstitutions, showing _the capacity for progressive improvement_ which\r\nexists in the idiot, gives the lie to this absurd and purely\r\nsensational hypothesis.\r\n\r\nHere let me add that I strongly deprecate introducing the _odium\r\ntheologicum_ into the discussion of this subject, being fully\r\nconscious of the futility of attempting to check an unwelcome or\r\ndistasteful theory by means of ecclesiastical censures; and I further\r\nadmit that in anything like a scientific demonstration of truth, an\r\nappeal to the affections would be absurdly out of place.[36] Moreover,\r\nI should not reject the Darwinian theory from any sensational notion\r\nthat its adoption was derogatory to Man's dignity, and I fully echo\r\nthe sentiment of the naturalist who said that he would prefer being\r\ndescended from a good honest monkey, than to be obliged to avow\r\nhimself the offspring of certain fanatical enemies of scientific\r\nknowledge and progress; but I do complain of the tendency of the\r\npresent day to accept new ideas without knowing or caring how to sift\r\nthem. Everything is hypothetical, and allowed to enter the mind\r\nthrough the ivory gate of fancy; and on purely hypothetical premises,\r\nan attempt is made to found conclusive arguments. Strip the assertions\r\nof all their vagueness and superficial varnish, and reduce them to a\r\nskeleton of logical statement, and we shall see how much is assumed\r\nand how little is proved; and we shall find that we are asked to\r\naccept a chain of hypotheses, as if it were an induction founded on\r\nascertained and indisputable facts. In thus expressing myself, I wish\r\nto add that the ultimate goal of the scientist is the establishment of\r\ntruth, and I should as soon attempt to stop the progress of the\r\navalanche that has become dislodged from the mountain top, as to try\r\nto bar the path of scientific progress, or to extinguish the torch of\r\ndiscovery. The tide of scientific truth will continue to flow on in\r\nspite of the modern Canutes, who may utter from time to time their\r\nimperial commands to stay its course. _Magna est veritas et\r\nprevalebit._\r\n\r\nThe supporters of evolution base their arguments upon the remarkable\r\nresemblance between the brain of man and that of certain other\r\nanimals. Now, I admit this striking analogy; I admit that every chief\r\nfissure and fold in the brain of man has its counterpart in that of\r\nthe gorilla and the ourang-outang; and I am not prepared to deny the\r\nstatement, that as far as the organ of intelligence is concerned,\r\nthere is no very striking physical difference between him who weighs\r\nthe stars and makes the light tell its secrets as to the constitution\r\nof distant worlds, and the howling senseless brute, who lives merely\r\nto satisfy his animal appetites. All animals of the vertebrate type\r\nare constructed on a plan which is essentially similar, not only as\r\nregards their skeleton, but as regards their brain. I don't deny that\r\nman is an animal, and that he has the essential properties of a\r\nhighly organised one; but what I do maintain is, that the brain, after\r\nall, is merely an _instrument_ by which the high psychological\r\nattributes peculiar to man become _externally_ manifested.[37] Thought\r\nis not phosphorus, as some would have us believe; the human mind is\r\nnot the result of a mere molecular arrangement of cerebral matter.\r\nThere is something over and above all this, and the very resemblance\r\nof man's physical nature to that of some members of the brute\r\ncreation, proves beyond all doubt that his superiority to them is\r\nhyperphysical, and I fully endorse Mr. Froude's philosophical remarks,\r\nwhen he says, \"It is nothing to me how the Maker of me has been\r\npleased to construct the organised substance which I call my body. It\r\nis mine, but it is not I. The νους, the intellectual spirit, being an\r\nουσια--an essence--I believe to be an imperishable something which has\r\nbeen engendered in me from another source.\" The unhappy idiot, that\r\nstricken member of our race, possesses the tripartite nature of\r\nman--for he has not only the σωμα or material part, and the ψυχη or\r\nprinciple of animal life, but he also undoubtedly possesses the πνευμα\r\nor principle of immortal life.\r\n\r\nThe above statement could be amply borne out by a reference to cases\r\nwhich have been observed in idiot asylums. I will, however, mention\r\nbut three:--An idiot boy has been known to retire alone, when there\r\nwas a thunderstorm, to ask God to take care of his father, who was a\r\nsailor. A former superintendent of our Asylum, the late Mr. Millard,\r\nnoticed one of the inmates praying in private, and on saying to the\r\nboy, \"God hears prayer,\" he quietly observed, \"Yes, and answers it,\r\ntoo.\" A little boy in the Massachussetts Asylum for Idiots was in\r\ndeclining health, and became, during his dying illness, an object of\r\ngreat interest to the matron and attendants. Unbidden, he said his\r\nprayers frequently, and putting up his little hand, he muttered, \"Me\r\nwant to go up! me want to go up!\" Surely he was thinking of some sort\r\nof hereafter, because he added distinctly, \"They'll say, here comes\r\none of the boys from the Boston School for Idiots.\" The approach of\r\ndeath seemed to awaken his spiritual life; out of the decaying body\r\nappeared to rise the growing soul, for, after repeating the verse of\r\na hymn, the spirit of this simple child became liberated from its\r\nearthly tenement--its material habitat--the connection between matter\r\nand mind was severed, and, to use the touching language of his\r\nbiographer, \"this poor little idiot boy bade a long adieu to his\r\nsorrowing friends, and doubtless there was then joy in heaven, as the\r\nrecording angel wrote in the Book of Life the name of George\r\nTobey.\"[38]\r\n\r\nIn an interesting essay published many years ago, entitled, \"A Morning\r\nat Essex Hall, Colchester,\" its author, the Rev. Edwin Sidney, in\r\ndescribing his visit to the Asylum, remarked that, \"The conduct of\r\nthose who go to Church on Sunday is very decorous. One of the most\r\ncheering things in connection with these objects of benevolent\r\nsolicitude, is the capability some of them manifest in receiving and\r\nbeing comforted by religion. There are amongst them instances of high\r\nconscientiousness and piety, which might be examples to such as are\r\ngifted with unimpaired faculties.\"\r\n\r\nIf any apology be due for pointing out how the mysterious connection\r\nbetween mind and matter may be illustrated by a study of idiocy, I\r\nwill observe that the subject is of such absorbing interest that it is\r\nwell that it should occasionally be removed from the heated arena of\r\nbiological bias, into the calmer and more judicial atmosphere of the\r\nclass of readers who may be interested in the important subject I am\r\nendeavouring to elucidate.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] I strongly deprecate, as lamentably wrong and needless, the\r\nviolent language sometimes used by writers on both sides of this great\r\ncontroversy of the origin of man. If the _odium theologicum_ may have\r\ninspired some of the opponents of evolution, it is undeniable that\r\nthere is strong evidence of an _odium antitheologicum_ amongst not a\r\nfew of the supporters of this doctrine, who indulge in abusive\r\nepithets, launching into personalities of a most objectionable kind;\r\nfor instance, we are informed that \"orthodoxy is the Bourbon of the\r\nworld of thought; it learns not, neither can it forget.\" Now I protest\r\nagainst the attempt to obscure argument by appeals to the passions and\r\nto prejudice. Science and Theology should not be regarded as two\r\nopposing citadels, frowning defiance upon each other, but their\r\nvotaries should look upon each other as co-labourers in the cause of\r\ntruth, and they should welcome light and knowledge from whatever\r\nquarter it may come, being fully convinced that all systems and\r\ntheories irreconcilable with truth, are built upon the sand, and must\r\nultimately be swept away.\r\n\r\n[37] One of our popular novelists, Sir Walter Besant, has\r\nphilosophically said, \"there is between the condition of Man and the\r\nBrute an interdependence which cannot but be recognised by every\r\nphysician. So greatly has this connection affected some of the modern\r\nphysicians, as to cause doubt in their minds whether there be any life\r\nat all hereafter; or if when the pulse ceases to beat, the whole man\r\nshould become a dead and senseless lump of clay. In this they confuse\r\nthe immortal soul with the perishable instruments of brain and body,\r\nthrough which in life it manifests its being and betrays its true\r\nnature, whether of good or evil.\"--_Faith and Freedom._\r\n\r\n[38] Cases like this would seem to illustrate the truth of the\r\nstatement of that great philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne, when he says,\r\n\"Thus it is observed that men sometimes, upon the hour of their\r\ndeparture, do speak and reason about themselves. For then the soul,\r\nbeing more freed from the ligaments of the body, begins to reason like\r\nherself, and to discourse in a strain above mortality.\"--_Religio\r\nMedici_, p. 208.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT AND RESULTS.\r\n\r\n    \"Distinguish'd link in being's endless chain,\r\n    Midway from nothing to the Deity.\r\n    Though sully'd and dishonour'd, still divine,\r\n    An heir of glory, a frail child of dust.\r\n    Helpless immortal!\"--_Young._\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the census of 1881, there were about 32,717 idiots and\r\nimbeciles in England and Wales; the Census Commissioners, however,\r\nascertained that owing to the reticence of parents, the returns were\r\nfar from trustworthy, and, after careful inquiry, they estimated the\r\ntotal number of idiots and imbeciles at 41,940; of these, it is\r\ncalculated that about 3,000 cases belong to the four Eastern Counties.\r\nOf this number, it is estimated that, after deducting pauper and other\r\ncases not considered suitable for this charity, there remain at least\r\n1,000 idiots who need the benefits of the Eastern Counties' Asylum,\r\nwhereas, our present accommodation is limited to 250 cases.[39]\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors being forcibly impressed with their inability\r\nadequately to supply the wants of the district, have recently\r\ninstituted a Permanent Endowment Fund. As the institution is mainly\r\nsupported by voluntary contributions, the fluctuating nature of which\r\nhas often caused considerable anxiety, the Board has felt the\r\ndesirability of placing a considerable portion of their resources on a\r\nmore solid basis; and it is with the view of giving stability and\r\npermanence to the work of the Asylum, that the Endowment Fund has been\r\nstarted, which it is proposed shall be inalienable, the interest only\r\nbeing used for the purposes of the Institution. In the year 1891,\r\nH.R.H. the Prince of Wales, with the view of furthering this object,\r\ngraciously consented to preside at a Festival Dinner, at the Hotel\r\nMetropole, London, which resulted in an immediate contribution of\r\n£6,000. This fund, started under such happy auspices, has already\r\nreached the sum of £25,334 12s. 8d., which it is hoped may eventually\r\nreach £50,000, the amount which the Directors think indispensable to\r\ninsure the efficient maintenance of the Asylum.\r\n\r\nNow let us bring this matter home to ourselves. Where are the 3,000\r\nunhappy blighted individuals that claim the Eastern Counties for their\r\nhome? It is true that some of them are in the homes of the affluent,\r\nbut the greater number are in the cottages of the poor, where the\r\ntrouble of providing for one such member often reduces a working\r\nfamily to pauperism; the poor child beloved by its parents, is,\r\nperhaps, loathed by their neighbours, is avoided by other children,\r\nhidden from visitors, a constant care and sorrow to the mother, a\r\nsource of anxious foresight to the father; in fact, the poor idiot\r\nchild is like a Upas tree, that poisons the whole atmosphere around\r\nit, and the burden of his presence in a poor man's family is a new\r\nweight added to the load that was already sinking them down. Perhaps\r\nyou may say, we agree with you, we lament as you do, that the narrow\r\nhome of the humble artisan should be rendered intolerable\r\nby the presence of these stricken members of our race; but, we have\r\nbeen given to understand, that if not absolutely incurable, but very\r\nlittle can be done for them, that they baffle the efforts of the most\r\nzealous educators, and are almost beyond the reach of human sympathy.\r\n\r\nNow this was the language generally used half a century ago, and a\r\ncelebrated French authority on the subject, Esquirol, considered that\r\nidiots were what they must remain for the rest of their lives; that\r\nthere was no possibility of ameliorating their condition, and that no\r\nmeans were known by which a larger amount of intelligence could be\r\ndeveloped in them.[40] In fact, an effort to ameliorate the condition\r\nof the congenital imbecile was regarded by psychologists and\r\nphysicians as absolutely hopeless, and the standard \"Dictionnaire de\r\nMédecine,\" published in 1837, broadly stated that it was useless to\r\nattempt to combat idiotism; in order that the intellectual exercise\r\nmight be established, it would be necessary to change the conformation\r\nof organs which are beyond the reach of all modification. So great was\r\nthe pessimism prevalent on this subject, that it was insinuated that\r\nthe idea of teaching an idiot could only enter the brain of one\r\nsomewhat closely allied to that class!\r\n\r\nNow, I am happy to tell you, that in the broad daylight of the\r\nnineteenth century, science gives an emphatic denial to this\r\nstatement. Yes, the results obtained at our own Asylum and elsewhere,\r\nshow that much, very much, may be done for the unhappy idiot, who in a\r\nprivate house is an intolerable incubus, but who, under proper\r\ntraining in a suitable asylum, becomes sociable, affectionate, and\r\nhappy. It has been shown that in the majority of cases, the idiot may\r\nnot only cease to be a source of annoyance and danger to those around\r\nhim, but by care and training he may be made able to contribute to his\r\nown sustenance; the knowledge of simple trades of a mechanical kind,\r\nsuch as that of a carpenter, shoemaker, or tailor, has been reached by\r\nsome, and household industrial pursuits have fitted others for\r\ndomestic usefulness.\r\n\r\nA celebrated German authority, Herr Saeger, of Berlin, has stated that\r\nin his establishment he had indubitable cases of idiocy, in which the\r\nhead was small and malformed, yet in which the results of education\r\nwere so triumphant, that they were ultimately able to mix with the\r\nworld without being recognised as idiots. Further, he tells us that\r\nin one instance a young man underwent confirmation without the priest\r\nsuspecting that he had been delivered from idiocy.\r\n\r\nDr. Shuttleworth records the case of an inmate of the Royal Albert\r\nAsylum, who became, under instruction, an expert joiner, and from\r\nbeing a very imp of mischief, grew up into a well-conducted,\r\nself-reliant youth, and ultimately emigrated to one of our colonies,\r\nand when he was last heard of, he was practising his trade in a\r\nleading city.[41]\r\n\r\nEqually satisfactory results have been obtained in our own Asylum. A\r\nfew years ago, a boy of eight was admitted into our Asylum, who was\r\nquite unmanageable at home, a terrible incubus in the household of\r\nwhich he formed part, and the constant subject of jeers and derisions\r\non the part of the other juveniles of the village. After about six\r\nmonths' systematic training, one of the officials of the Asylum wrote\r\nto inform me that the boy had so much improved that he was afraid the\r\nCommissioners of Lunacy, at their next visit, would consider the boy\r\nno longer a fit subject for detention in the Asylum. Being on a short\r\nvisit to his relatives, who reside near Norwich, he was brought to me\r\nfor inspection, when I was struck with the miraculous transformation\r\nthat had been effected; from a restless, destructive boy, he had been\r\nchanged into a well-conducted lad, and he had actually been taught to\r\nwrite. At my request, he wrote very legibly his name and address, with\r\nthe date, \"James Smith, Colchester;\" but he made a little mistake in\r\nthe date, writing backwards, in the Chinese fashion--it being\r\nSeptember 29th, he wrote \"September 92nd!\" This same boy was regularly\r\nemployed as one of the gardeners to the institution, and has recently\r\nbeen discharged, and is now earning his own living as gardener in a\r\nprivate family. This case illustrates a peculiarity not infrequently\r\nremarked in the inmates of an idiot asylum, that is the remarkable\r\npropensity they have for imitation and shamming. This boy came to stay\r\nwith his relatives in Norfolk for a few weeks, when every few days he\r\nwould have an epileptic fit. When his holiday was over and he had\r\nreturned to the Asylum, these fits recurred, and were, of course,\r\nreported to the medical attendant, who had a shrewd suspicion the boy\r\nwas shamming. He thereupon said to the attendant: \"The next time a fit\r\ncomes on, I must apply a redhot iron to the soles of the feet, it will\r\nhurt him, but it will cure him.\" From that time the boy had no\r\nepileptic fits!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thyroid Treatment of Idiocy._--My sketch of the treatment of Idiocy\r\nwould be incomplete without an allusion to the injection or internal\r\nadministration of a preparation of the thyroid gland of the sheep, a\r\nmethod of treatment brought into notoriety by Professors Kocher and\r\nSchiff, on the continent, and by Professor Victor Horsley, Dr. Murray,\r\nand others in this country. Numerous cases have been published\r\nclaiming successful results, and the thyroid treatment has been spoken\r\nof as a cure for at least one of the forms of idiocy.\r\n\r\nWithout quite endorsing this sweeping and enthusiastic statement,\r\nthere cannot be a doubt that this method opens up a hopeful vista in\r\nthe treatment of idiocy; in fact, Dr. Ireland has furnished me with\r\nthe particulars of a girl, aged five years, treated by thyroid juice,\r\nin whom \"the improvement was so decided that it seemed an escape from\r\nidiocy into normal intelligence.\"[42]\r\n\r\nA striking instance of the good results of thyroid treatment has\r\nlately occurred in the Eastern Counties' Asylum, the particulars of\r\nwhich have been kindly furnished to me by Mr. Kirkby, the Resident\r\nMedical Officer. Esther C., aged 19, was admitted Nov. 8th, 1894, with\r\nmarked symptoms of Sporadic Cretinism. She was at once put on thyroid\r\ntreatment, beginning with half a five-grain tabloid gradually\r\nincreased to a tabloid once, twice, and sometimes three times a day,\r\nintermitting them for short periods. Latterly, she has been taking one\r\ntabloid a day. Under this treatment, she has gained 10 lbs. in weight,\r\nand has grown 5 inches; the features are not so coarse, the previous\r\nmyxœdematous condition of the subcutaneous tissues has subsided, the\r\noutline of the features having become more defined, and the skin which\r\nwas formerly dry and rough, has become soft and naturally moist,\r\nhaving lost a great deal of its puffiness; but the most obvious change\r\nin the patient is the disappearance of the two prominent elastic\r\nswellings (pseudo-lipomata) which formerly occupied the posterior\r\ntriangle of the neck on each side. The mental condition has also\r\nimproved, she takes more interest in amusements, and her voluntary\r\nmovements are much more rapid. This patient is still under\r\nobservation, and the results hitherto attained afford a favourable\r\nillustration of the beneficial effects of this mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the New York Academy of Medicine of March 12th, 1896,\r\nDr. Emily Lewi reported the history of a very marked case of Cretinism\r\nin a girl, aged 13 months, who was put on thyroid treatment;\r\nimprovement was noted in a week, and the child grew gradually\r\nintelligent. At this same meeting, Dr. G.M. Hammond expressed the\r\nopinion, that for thyroid treatment to be effectual, it must be begun\r\nin early life.[43]\r\n\r\nMy colleague, Dr. Burton-Fanning, has recently shown me a case of\r\nCretinism under his care, at the Lind Infirmary for Children, in which\r\nthyroid treatment produced the most favourable results, not only of a\r\nphysical, but of a psychical character. Although the child was four\r\nyears old, he had not previously spoken a word, and understood\r\nnothing; but during the treatment, his expression became much less\r\nvacant, and the faculty of speech was roused into action.\r\n\r\nSeveral valuable contributions have lately been made to our knowledge\r\nof the effects of thyroid feeding, more especially in the treatment of\r\ninsanity, not however the less valuable as a guide to its probable\r\nbenefit in idiocy. I wish more especially to allude to the researches\r\nof Dr. Lewis C. Bruce, at the Royal Asylum, Edinburgh, as reported in\r\nthe \"Journal of Mental Science\" for January and October, 1895. There\r\nis much in the above essay that I could profitably comment upon, but I\r\nwill content myself with saying that the outcome of these researches,\r\nwhich intimately concern the treatment of idiocy, is that Dr. Bruce\r\nhas established the fact that thyroid feeding acts as a direct\r\ncerebral stimulant, which he thinks \"may prove advantageous in cases\r\nwhere the higher cortical cells remain in an anergic condition.\" Dr.\r\nBruce mentions the case of a patient who had not spoken for several\r\nmonths; one day, during the administration of the thyroid extract, he\r\nsuddenly began to talk, and soon became quite communicative.\r\n\r\nWhilst these pages are passing through the press, M. Auguste Voisin,\r\nPhysician to La Salpêtrière, has had the courtesy to send me detailed\r\nparticulars of a case of insanity in which the success of the thyroid\r\ntreatment was phenomenal. The patient was a female, aged 25, and her\r\nmental derangement assumed the form of religious monomania, insomnia,\r\nand aural hallucinations; there was great emaciation, dryness of the\r\nskin, and cold extremities.[44]\r\n\r\nNo benefit having resulted from six months' treatment, including\r\nhypnotism, M. Voisin determined to try the subcutaneous injection of\r\nsterilised thyroid juice. After a few weeks of this treatment, a\r\nnotable amelioration was observed; shortly afterwards all her\r\nunfavourable symptoms disappeared, and she was discharged cured.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features in this case is the result of the\r\nanalysis of the blood, as to its corpuscular richness. Before thyroid\r\ntreatment was commenced, the number of corpuscles was only 2,225,000\r\nper cubic millimetre; after the cure by the thyroid juice, the number\r\nwas more than doubled, being 4,774,000 per cubic millimetre. In Dr.\r\nLewis Bruce's cases, to which I have already referred, the result was\r\nthe reverse of that observed by M. Voisin; for in the eight\r\nuncomplicated cases recorded by Dr. Bruce, with one exception, there\r\nwas in all of them a diminution in the number of red corpuscles.\r\n\r\nAt the discussion on Myxœdema, at the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical\r\nSociety, to which I have already alluded, Dr. Alexander Bruce showed a\r\ncase of myxœdema under the care of Professor Fraser, in the Royal\r\nInfirmary, in which, as the result of thyroid feeding, a condition of\r\nrelative anæmia had been developed. The patient had no murmurs when\r\nadmitted, but since the administration of thyroid preparations, basal\r\nand mitral systolic bruits had developed themselves. It is further\r\nstated that the blood corpuscles had fallen from 4,600,000 to\r\n3,700,000, and hæmoglobin from 78 per cent. to 59 per cent.[45]\r\n\r\nFurther researches would therefore seem to be necessary, before we can\r\narrive at a satisfactory conclusion as to what effect the thyroid\r\ntreatment has upon the blood.\r\n\r\nPossibly the dose of the thyroid preparation may be an important\r\nfactor in the result, for Dr. Byrom Bramwell, in an important and\r\nexhaustive monograph upon this subject, says, that anæmia is apt to be\r\nproduced by large doses of the remedy; and he mentions a case where\r\nthe red blood corpuscles and the hæmoglobin underwent a marked\r\ndiminution during the period of acute thyroidism, but rapidly\r\nincreased under the subsequent administration of small doses of the\r\nremedy.[46]\r\n\r\nThe subject of blood analysis is most important, as tending to throw\r\nsome light upon a matter at present but little understood, namely the\r\nphysiological effect of thyroid preparations upon the blood.\r\n\r\nDr. Telford-Smith has reported four cases of Sporadic Cretinism\r\ntreated by thyroid extract at the Royal Albert Asylum, Lancaster, when\r\na well-marked improvement was noticed in each case. The clinical\r\nhistory of these cases is given with minute detail by Dr.\r\nTelford-Smith, and is well worthy of close study by those interested\r\nin this subject.[47]\r\n\r\nQuite recently, at the Annual Meeting of the British Medical\r\nAssociation, held at Carlisle in August of the present year,\r\ncommunications were read on the Thyroid Treatment of Cretinism and\r\nImbecility, by Dr. Rushton Parker, Dr. Telford-Smith, Dr. John\r\nThomson, and others. An animated discussion ensued, the tendency of\r\nwhich pointed to the undoubted advantages both physically and mentally\r\nof the use of this remedy.\r\n\r\nAlthough the physiological effects of thyroid feeding may not be\r\ndefinitely recognised and understood, there is overwhelming evidence\r\nto show that it produces marked psychical results, that it acts as a\r\ndirect cerebral stimulant, and we have every reason to rely upon it as\r\na valuable adjuvant to our treatment of idiocy; and it is not too much\r\nto say that the treatment of this infirmity, as well as of other\r\nmental defects, by thyroid extract or some other preparation of the\r\nthyroid gland, is one of the greatest triumphs of modern medicine; but\r\nmuch still remains to be learnt, as Professor Victor Horsley remarks,\r\n\"So definite and pronounced is the cachexia thyroidectomica, that few\r\nsubjects in the range of pathology offer a more fruitful and inviting\r\nfield of research.\"[48]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craniectomy._--The operation of Craniectomy (that is the cutting of\r\nstrips of bone from the cranium) has been recommended and practised in\r\ncases of microcephalic idiocy, an operation suggested upon the theory\r\nof premature synostosis, or closure of the cranial sutures, thus\r\ncausing an arrest in the development of the subjacent cerebral tissue.\r\nAlthough I could not omit a reference to this operation, it has not\r\nmet with general acceptance, and one of the most recent writers on\r\nthis subject, M. Bourneville, physician at Bicêtre, discourages it\r\naltogether; and from his examination of the skulls of a number of\r\nidiots, he affirms that \"in the immense majority of cases, there was\r\nno premature synostosis, and that neither normal anatomy,\r\npathological anatomy, or physiology, justified the operation of\r\nCraniectomy.\"[49] The late Sir George Humphry was of the same opinion,\r\nas, after an examination of 19 microcephalic skulls, he said, \"There\r\nis nothing to suggest that the deficiency in the development of the\r\nskull was the leading feature in the deformity, or anything to give\r\nencouragement to the practice lately adopted in some instances of a\r\nremoval of a part of the bony case, with the idea of affording more\r\nspace and freedom for the growth of the brain.\"[50]\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the New York State Medical Society, Professor\r\nDana read a paper on Craniectomy for Idiocy and Imbecility, and he\r\ngave the following result of 81 cases:--In 35, there was improvement;\r\nin 22, no improvement; and death ensued in 24 cases. The conclusion at\r\nwhich Professor Dana arrives is that \"it is largely through its\r\npedagogic influence that an improvement takes place, and that the\r\noperation is allied in its effect to a severe piece of castigation!\"\r\nDr. Dana freely admits that this view of craniectomy for idiocy and\r\nimbecility lends itself readily to humour, and it would seem that he\r\nintended to kill the operation by ridicule.[51]\r\n\r\nOf course, Dr. Ireland has something to say upon this point, and after\r\na brief review of the literature of the subject, he says: \"So many\r\ncases have been collected of microcephales with open sutures, that it\r\nis not likely that anyone will continue to hold that the small size of\r\nthe brain is owing to the sutures closing in, and thus hindering their\r\ngrowth. Even in those cases where the sutures have closed in before\r\nbirth, the question still remains whether the brain ceased to grow\r\nbecause the sutures are closed, or whether the sutures closed in\r\nbecause the brain ceased to grow; or, lastly, whether both the brain\r\nand its coverings ceased to grow under a common cause.\"[52]\r\n\r\nThe benefits to be derived in apparently hopeless cases of idiocy,\r\nfrom the systematic and persevering use of all the modern adjuvants\r\nand appliances now available for treatment, are now so universally\r\nrecognised, that it would be superfluous to dwell further on this\r\npoint. Science has done much for the idiot, and she will do more, for\r\nher motto is \"Excelsior,\" and her votaries are not content to linger\r\nwith complacency on the heights already attained, but they look for\r\nthe period when, by the powerful lever of an enlightened philanthropy,\r\nthis benighted race shall be raised from the grovelling level of the\r\nbrute, to the highest attainable pitch of bodily perfection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI trust that I have said enough to justify an earnest appeal for\r\nsympathy with this unfortunate branch of the human family. I have\r\nendeavoured to show that a great social evil exists amongst us, and\r\nthat duty and interest should alike concur to induce us to face this\r\nevil and to master it. I have endeavoured to point out how the care\r\nand training of the idiot has become one of the recognised obligations\r\nof a philanthropic public. At the Eastern Counties' Asylum, we are\r\ntrying to mitigate as far as we can this great social calamity, and\r\nour efforts have hitherto been crowned with unlooked-for success. We\r\nare doing a grand and glorious work, and I ask you to come and help\r\nus; the Board of Directors, a noble band of philanthropists, who\r\ndevote a considerable amount of time to the objects of this charity,\r\nask you to come and help us; nay, more, from the cottage homes in East\r\nAnglia rendered miserable by the presence of these unhappy beings, a\r\nthousand voices cry to you with trumpet tongue, \"Come and help us.\"\r\n\r\nWe have in the Eastern Counties' Asylum an institution admirably\r\nadapted for the care and treatment of the idiot; standing in its own\r\ngrounds of seven acres, it is furnished with all the machinery\r\nnecessary to grapple with this great social calamity, and by the\r\njudicious combination of medical, physical, moral, and intellectual\r\nagencies, we are enabled to develop and regulate the bodily functions\r\nof the idiot, to arouse his observation, to quicken his power of\r\nthought, and thus develop the sensitive and perceptive faculties; and\r\nwe have not only succeeded in raising these poor creatures from a\r\nstate of hopeless degradation to a state of comfort and usefulness,\r\nbut we have, in many instances, succeeded in kindling up in their\r\ndark and twilight minds some dim anticipations of a brighter world;\r\nthe veil which obscured their intellect has been rendered transparent,\r\nand to use the language of the bard of Avon, we have been privileged\r\nto observe that--\r\n\r\n    \"As the morning steals upon the night,\r\n    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses\r\n    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\r\n    Their clearer reason.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Asylum proper, the Board has lately purchased a\r\nfarm-house with 32 acres of land, immediately adjoining the main\r\nbuilding. By means of this welcome acquisition, increased\r\naccommodation is afforded, and facilities are given for drafting off\r\nsome of the most tractable patients who require less supervision than\r\nthe majority of the inmates; moreover, farm work has proved very\r\nuseful in training some of the patients who come from agricultural\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crossley House._--Our area of usefulness has recently been extended\r\nby the munificent gift of Sir Savile Crossley, Bart., of a\r\nConvalescent Home, at Clacton-on-Sea. The building has accommodation\r\nfor twenty patients; it stands facing the sea, in its own grounds of\r\nnearly an acre, and its privacy is secured by a walled-in garden, in\r\nwhich the inmates are able to take ample exercise. As a large number\r\nof our patients suffer from scrofula, or from some tubercular disease,\r\nthe want has been long felt of a seaside adjunct, where such patients\r\ncould be treated in the initial stage. Thanks to Sir Savile Crossley's\r\nprincely gift, we now possess this valuable addition to our medical\r\nresources, the advantages of which cannot be too highly estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ladies' Association._--The valuable additions that have recently\r\nbeen made to the Asylum, thus largely increasing the accommodation for\r\npatients, have necessarily entailed a largely increased expenditure,\r\nwhich could not have been met by the current income, had not the\r\nladies of East Anglia come forward with great earnestness to help the\r\nobjects of this Asylum by individual and energetic efforts; and one of\r\nthe most interesting events of the last few years has been the\r\nformation of a Ladies' Association, the establishment of which is\r\nentirely due to the earnest and devoted efforts of the Marchioness of\r\nBristol. Its object is to disseminate information respecting the\r\nworking of the Asylum, to secure admission for necessitous cases, and\r\nto organise and carry out annually house to house collections for its\r\nfunds. H.R.H. the Princess of Wales has given her countenance to this\r\nmovement by graciously accepting the office of Patroness, several\r\ninfluential ladies have consented to act as presidents over the\r\nvarious districts into which the four counties have been divided, and\r\nas many as 1,400 ladies are engaged in this philanthropic work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSSLEY HOUSE, CLACTON-ON-SEA.]\r\n\r\nThe success attending this movement has been phenomenal. During the\r\nfirst year of its operation, the substantial sum of £1,868 6s. 10d.\r\nwas handed over to the general fund, this amount having been obtained\r\nfrom upwards of 20,000 contributors, who had thus the opportunity of\r\njoining in this good work, and whose aid could not have been secured\r\nin any other way. The efforts of these charitable ladies have been\r\ncrowned with such signal success, that the large sum of £9,473 5s. 9d.\r\nhas been added to the funds of the Asylum.[53] This substantial help\r\nis very gratifying to the Directors of the Institution, who now rely\r\nupon the Ladies' Association for nearly a fourth part of their income;\r\nand it is not too much to say that the future success of the Asylum is\r\nintimately connected with the continuance of the efforts of these\r\nphilanthropic ladies, who seem to me to be influenced by the noble\r\nsentiments lately expressed by one of their number, that \"The simple\r\nobligation of all thoughtful women, is that of making the world within\r\nour reach the better for our being, and gladder for our human speech.\r\nIt is a work such as this that I am sure stirs us up to feel that we\r\nmust also give our help, our sympathy, our lives for other people, and\r\nin this work lies the elements of unselfishness.\"[54]\r\n\r\nAll honour to these ladies, who, having learnt the elementary truth\r\nthat privileges involve responsibilities, instead of hiding their\r\ntalents in the napkin of selfishness, prefer to go forth as messengers\r\nof mercy, to try and flash the electric fire of philanthropy into the\r\nslumbering hearts of others, and to induce them to join in their\r\ngrand and good work. They thus become a force and a factor of\r\ninfluence with all around them, and their reward will be the\r\nsatisfaction of feeling that they are contributing their part in the\r\ngreat work of elevating these stricken members of our race, from their\r\npresent unhappy and degraded condition to a higher position in the\r\nscale of created intelligence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI trust I have said enough to show that the idiot ought and must be\r\ncared for; and in asking for your support, I will also ask you whether\r\nanything can be more gratifying than, as the result of scientific\r\ntreatment, to see the idiot standing erect, asserting his birthright,\r\nand claiming brotherhood with the rest of the human family.\r\n\r\nTrue philanthropy never stops short of the remotest boundary of human\r\nwant, and in urging upon you the claims of the Eastern Counties'\r\nAsylum for Idiots, I would have you remember that I am pleading for a\r\nclass who cannot plead for themselves, and whose very silence is\r\neloquent with an appeal for your merciful aid.\r\n\r\nRemember that these poor stricken individuals are members of the human\r\nfamily. They are heirs with us of all that human beings may hope for\r\nfrom the hands of a common Father. They possess the rudiments of all\r\nhuman attributes, especially the distinctive attribute of educability\r\nand of progressive improvement; their bodies are the vehicles which\r\ncarry souls never destined to perish, through the series of ages, and\r\nwhen the walls of the cottages of clay in which their better part has\r\nsojourned collapse, and they mingle with their kindred dust, the freed\r\ninhabitants shall wing their way to brighter regions and to a more\r\nenduring home, and will thus illustrate the beautiful sentiment of one\r\nof our modern poets, when he said:\r\n\r\n    \"In death's unrobing room we strip from round us\r\n      This garment of mortality and earth,\r\n    And breaking from the embryo-state which bound us,\r\n      Our day of dying is our day of birth.\"\r\n\r\nEach person here belongs to one of two classes. Either you have one of\r\nthese unhappy beings in your own immediate circle, or you have not. If\r\nyou have, you can feel all the more for those who are similarly\r\nafflicted with yourselves, but have not your means for mitigating\r\ntheir dire distress, and you will think of the narrow home of the\r\nhumble artisan or labourer, rendered intolerable by the constant\r\npresence of one of these afflicted members of our race. If, on the\r\nother hand, you have been spared this overwhelming calamity in your\r\nown family, and have had the joy of watching the dawn of infant\r\nintelligence, and have experienced the delight of seeing the\r\ncapacities shown in the early life of your own children gradually\r\nripen and develop into the intelligence of manhood, you will look with\r\nan eye of pity on the numerous households rendered miserable by the\r\nintolerable incubus of the presence in their midst of an idiot child,\r\nand will, I am sure, consider any assistance you can render to so good\r\na cause in the light of a thank-offering.\r\n\r\nThe wear and tear of an excitable idiot child has wrecked many a\r\nfamily and reduced it to pauperism, for not only is such child a dead\r\nweight on the material prosperity of the family, but the hands of\r\nthose who have to work for their livelihood, are sadly tied and\r\nhampered, when such an inmate has to be constantly looked after in the\r\nhome; the labour by which the household is supported is often\r\ninterrupted by one who can contribute nothing to the common stock, and\r\nthe time which is so precious to hard-working people must, in part at\r\nall events, be occupied in caring for the one, who, if uncared for\r\nand neglected, must sink lower in the social scale and fall into a\r\nstill more degraded condition. The care and treatment of the idiot,\r\ntherefore, becomes a vital question of Political Economy; for by\r\nrelieving a household of the burden and anxiety incident to the care\r\nof the afflicted child, the parents are enabled to devote all their\r\nenergies to the support of their family. Moreover, there is often a\r\nmoral aspect corresponding with the mental aspect of this question,\r\nand the presence of an idiot often becomes a source of real danger.\r\nOur able superintendent, Mr. Turner, in his interesting report for the\r\nyear 1895, has illustrated the terrible anxiety caused by the presence\r\nof an idiot child in the homes of the poor, by the history of an\r\ninmate of our Asylum, who, when at home, being left to mind the baby,\r\nblacked its face all over with soot, so that when his mother returned,\r\nshe might think she had a black baby. On another occasion, his little\r\nsister wanted some water, and he told her to drink out of the kettle\r\non the fire, by which she nearly lost her life. This boy, who was\r\nevidently a type of the mischievous class of idiots, was once turned\r\nout of the Parish Church during service, for pricking another boy with\r\na pin, so that he yelled out and disturbed the whole congregation. Two\r\ncases of murder by idiots have been recorded in a report of the\r\nCommissioners on Idiocy to the General Assembly of Connecticut; an\r\nidiot girl, being left alone with an infant, killed it by striking it\r\non the head with a flat iron; and another vicious idiot killed a man\r\nwho was working with him, by striking him on the head with a shovel.\r\nEsquirol also records the case of an idiot in the Salzburg Hospital,\r\nwho killed a man by severing his head from his body with a hatchet,\r\nand then calmly seated himself by the side of the dead body.[55]\r\n\r\nPhilanthropists of the Eastern Counties of England, many of you have\r\nbeen long accustomed to sympathise with suffering and want; here is\r\nanother outlet for your charitable efforts. The most illustrious\r\nlandowner in East Anglia has recently extended his Royal patronage to\r\nthis institution, especially established for the care of idiots from\r\nthe four counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, and Cambridgeshire; and\r\nhis Royal Consort the Princess of Wales has most graciously consented\r\nto accept the position of Patroness of the Ladies' Association, thus\r\nshowing the deep interest that is felt by their Royal Highnesses in\r\nthis important Eastern Counties' Charity. I ask you to follow their\r\nnoble example; I ask you to come and help us in our attempts to rescue\r\na large section of the human family from the worse than Cimmerian\r\ndarkness in which they have been hitherto enshrouded; come and help us\r\nto awaken faculties hitherto dormant, to restore lost minds, to arouse\r\nthese unhappy beings from a moral death to a new birth of perception\r\nand feeling; come and help us in arousing the slumbering power to\r\nutterance, and you shall hear the once silent tongue eloquent with the\r\noutgushings of a liberated spirit.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate and to emphasise the statement,\r\nthat these unfortunate members of the human family possess the\r\ntripartite nature of man--body, soul, and spirit--σωμα, ψυχη, πνευμα;\r\nthey have the _germ_ of intellectual activity and of moral\r\nresponsibility, and this germ, cherished and nourished by the genial\r\nwarmth of human kindness, fenced round and protected from the blasts\r\nand buffetings of the world by the cords of true philanthropy, watered\r\nby the dew of human sympathy, although possibly only permitted to bud\r\nhere, is destined hereafter to expand into a perfect flower, and\r\nflourish perennially in another and a better state of being.\r\n\r\n    \"Eternal process moving on,\r\n    From state to state the spirit walks.\r\n    All these are but the shattered stalks\r\n    Or ruined chrysalis of one.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] A society has lately been formed under the name of \"The National\r\nAssociation for promoting the welfare of the Feeble-minded,\" the\r\nobject of which is to establish homes for defective and feeble-minded\r\nchildren of a class more highly-endowed with intelligence than those\r\nwho would be received into an ordinary idiot asylum; statistics having\r\nshown that ignorance and mental dulness tend to crime in various\r\nforms. Without expressing any very decided opinion upon the above\r\nproject, it seems to me that the unnecessary multiplication of\r\ncharitable institutions is itself an evil, and is not calculated to\r\npromote efficiency or economy; and if special provision is made for\r\nthose just above the highest class of idiots, as is proposed, the\r\npresent Idiot Asylums must necessarily suffer. Without, therefore, in\r\nany way disparaging the above scheme, I would suggest great caution in\r\nreference to it, as it is impolitic and unwise to make fresh demands\r\nupon a philanthropic public, unless the need for it is clearly\r\nestablished, as the result must inevitably be the diversion of funds\r\nfrom existing institutions already doing a good and charitable work.\r\n\r\n[40] Maladies Mentales, Tome ii., p. 76, par E. Esquirol, médecin en\r\nchef de la maison royale des aliénés de Charenton. \"Les idiots sont ce\r\nqu'ils doivent être pendant tout le cours de leur vie. On ne conçoit\r\npas la possibilité de changer cet état. Rien ne saurait donner aux\r\nmalheureux idiots, même pour quelques instants, plus de raison, plus\r\nd'intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n[41] \"Mentally deficient children,\" page 110.\r\n\r\n[42] This painstaking observer has investigated this subject in an\r\ninteresting communication on Sporadic Cretinism in the \"Edinburgh\r\nMedical Journal\" for May, 1893. Dr. Ireland considers Sporadic\r\nCretinism to be a congenital or infantile form of myxœdema, and\r\nbearing in mind the increasing mental torpor which has followed the\r\nablation of the thyroid gland performed by Kocher, and the cretinoid\r\ncondition induced in monkeys by the removal of the thyroid by Horsley,\r\nhe is drawn to the conclusion that this gland secretes and pours\r\nsomething into the blood which has a powerful effect upon the\r\nnutrition and function of the brain, and of the whole organism, and\r\nthese views receive a certain amount of confirmation from the fact\r\nthat in most cases of Sporadic Cretinism the thyroid gland is totally\r\nwanting. Dr. Ireland also expresses the opinion, in which I fully\r\nconcur, that there is too much solidism in our pathology, and that the\r\nvital powers of the blood have been too much overlooked.\r\n\r\nAlthough the effect of thyroid treatment in the idiot is still _sub\r\njudice,_ there is overwhelming testimony of its value in Myxœdema, an\r\nallied affection; and I would refer those who desire further\r\ninformation upon this matter to an important discussion at the\r\nEdinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society, in February, 1893, arising out\r\nof papers read by Professor Greenfield, Dr. Byrom Bramwell, Dr.\r\nLundie, Dr. Dunlop, and Dr. John Thomson, when important additions\r\nwere made to the literature of this affection by Dr. Affleck, Dr.\r\nGeorge Murray, and others, whose matured views will form a valuable\r\ncontribution to our knowledge of this somewhat obscure subject.\r\n\r\n[43] \"Pediatrics,\" May, 1896, p. 460.\r\n\r\n[44] I give M.

The author\r\nof the above treatise is one of the most prolific French writers on\r\nIdiocy, and I desire to call especial attention to that part of the\r\nwork which embraces the Medico-Pedagogic Treatment of Idiocy. In this\r\nsection, M.

It stands in its own grounds of six acres, near the Railway\r\nStation, and is supported by voluntary contributions. There is a small\r\nFarm attached to the Asylum and a Sea-side Branch at Clacton-on-Sea,\r\nand there is accommodation for 250 patients. Those whose friends are\r\nunable to pay for their care and maintenance, are elected to the\r\nbenefits of the Asylum by the votes of the Subscribers, and, subject\r\nto the rules and regulations, are admitted for five years. It is\r\nexpected, however, that some contribution should be made if possible.\r\nAfter residence in the Asylum for 3-1/2 years, and if it is found that\r\npatients are unable to be taught wholly or partly to maintain\r\nthemselves, they may be re-elected for additional terms of five years,\r\nand a small proportion are allowed to be re-elected for life. Insane\r\npersons, and cases suffering from confirmed Epilepsy, are not eligible\r\nfor admission. Paying Patients are admitted by the Board of Directors,\r\nwithout election, at any time, the charges varying according to the\r\ncircumstances of the friends and their requirements. Separate sitting\r\nand bedroom accommodation, with the advantage of a special Attendant\r\nor Nurse, is provided when wished, such an arrangement combining the\r\nquietude and comfort of a private residence with the hygienic,\r\neducational, and training resources of a Public Institution. The\r\nAsylum is under the personal charge of Mr. and Mrs. J.J. C. Turner,\r\nSuperintendent and Matron, and there is likewise a Resident Medical\r\nAttendant.\r\n\r\nThe Elections occur in the Spring and Autumn, and are held in the\r\nprincipal towns of the Eastern Counties. Donors of Five Guineas are\r\nentitled to a Life Vote, and Annual Subscribers of Half-a-Guinea to\r\ntwo votes annually, the right of Voting as regards higher sums being\r\nincreased in the same proportion. Contributors may individually\r\nexercise the right of Voting, or transfer the same to the House\r\nCommittee of the Asylum or to any Local Committee.\r\n\r\nReports, Forms of Application for Admission, and any other information\r\nwill be supplied by the Secretary, Mr. John J.C. Turner, Asylum,\r\nColchester.\r\n\r\nThe Board of Directors earnestly appeal for Annual Subscriptions and\r\nDonations to enable them to carry on this important work. Since 1884\r\nthe Annual Subscriptions have been reduced, owing to deaths and\r\ndiscontinuance, by upwards of £1,000. The applications for admission\r\nare numerous and urgent, and the present expenditure exceeds £7,000\r\nannually, towards which only £800 is forthcoming from invested\r\nCapital. Only those who are brought into close contact with mental\r\naffliction can adequately realise the sad trial and immense anxiety of\r\nhaving an Idiot child, and where this affliction has not been\r\nexperienced, it is hoped that some sum, however small, will be given\r\nas a thank-offering.\r\n\r\n    JOHN J.C.

It teems with\r\nillustrative cases, and is essentially one for the student of Aphasia\r\nalways to have by him, in order that he may readily refer to it from\r\ntime to time; any case he may have under his care will indeed be rare\r\nif he cannot find an allusion to a parallel one in Dr. Bateman's book.\r\n\r\n\"We think that the author was very well advised in extending chapter\r\nxii., for there are grouped together a number of interesting facts on\r\nimportant topics, such as the difference between the convolutions of\r\ncriminals and of intellectual men, the difference in the microscopic\r\nstructure of the brain, the cranial capacity, and other subjects of\r\nwhich it is usually difficult to find any mention.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _London Medical Recorder_.\r\n\r\n\"The numerous clinical cases form a valuable feature in this book.\r\nThese illustrative records have been gathered from a wide range of\r\nreading and experience, and hardly any case of importance bearing on\r\nthe subject appears to have escaped notice. As a work of reference,\r\nthen, this volume will be indispensable to all who are interested in\r\nthe study of nervous diseases.\"\r\n\r\n    From _Nature_.\r\n\r\n\"A useful part of this work is a chapter on the Medical Jurisprudence\r\nof Aphasia. This is a subject which we believe has not been touched\r\nupon in any previous English text-book, and it is of the greatest\r\nimportance. To summarise briefly, we may say that Dr. Bateman's work\r\nis one that should be read by everyone interested in the faculty of\r\nlanguage, or in diseases of the nervous system. It contains an\r\nenormous amount of valuable material, which has been put together by\r\ngreat labour, and is written by one who has devoted many long years to\r\nhis subject.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _Solicitor's Journal_.\r\n\r\n\"This book is a second and greatly-enlarged edition of a treatise\r\npublished some years since by Dr. Bateman. It gained a prize, on the\r\nrecommendation of the French Academy of Medicine, in 1891, and its\r\nauthor has recently received the honour of knighthood, in recognition\r\nof his distinguished labours.\r\n\r\n\"While the whole work possesses great scientific interest, chapters v.\r\nand x. are of peculiar value to general and legal readers. In the\r\nlatter, the Jurisprudence of Aphasia is dealt with. This question has\r\nnot hitherto been treated by any British author, although it involves\r\nissues of such frequent occurrence and general importance as the\r\ncapacity of speechless persons to make a will and to manage their\r\naffairs, and their civil and criminal responsibility. Having examined\r\nthis part of Dr. Bateman's treatise with the utmost care, we have no\r\nhesitation in commending it heartily to our readers as an able\r\nexposition of a difficult subject, enriched by illustrations from\r\nContinental Jurisprudence.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _Norfolk Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n\"In the goodly volume of over 400 pages before us, we have substantial\r\nproof of the perfection that may be attained by Theory and Practice,\r\nwalking and working hand in hand. An eminent physician, whose great\r\nenergies and rare knowledge of therapeutics are apparently absorbed in\r\nthe everyday exercise of his noble profession, has yet found time for\r\ndeep research and original speculation in one of the most fascinating\r\nregions in the whole range of Neuro-pathology. The result is such as\r\nonly the well-directed devotion of a life-time could have produced.\r\nHere, in one, we have a student's text-book, a scientist's guide and\r\ncompanion, and, lastly, a psychological treatise certain to attract a\r\nlarge share of attention at the hands of the intelligent general\r\nreader. For the medical profession it possesses, without doubt, a\r\nprimary interest--yet, withal, it is replete with interest to the\r\ngeneral reader.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINENTAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\n_Les Archives de Neurologie_, Vol. xx.\r\n\r\n\"Ce livre est la deuxième édition considérablement augmentée du traité\r\npublié il y a vingt ans et bien connu de nos lecteurs.\r\n\r\n\"N.B.--Ce livre est parfaitement au courant de la science actuelle.\"\r\n\r\n    _La Revue de l'Hypnotisme._\r\n\r\n\"L'ouvrage du docteur Bateman a déjà reçu un accueil favorable de\r\nl'Académie des sciences et de l'Académie de médecine de Paris. En le\r\nprésentant à la Société de Biologie, le Président, M. Brown-Séquard, a\r\nfait un éloge mérité de ce remarquable ouvrage aussi savant\r\nqu'original.\r\n\r\n\"Le livre du docteur Bateman apporte une contribution précieuse à la\r\nmédecine psychologique. M. Bateman a compulsé toute la littérature\r\nscientifique de l'Europe et de l'Amérique sur le sujet qu'il a traité,\r\net ses études faites pendant plus de vingt années sur les cas qu'il a\r\nrencontrés à l'hôpital de Norwich et dans sa clientèle privée, lui ont\r\npermis d'arriver a des conclusions véritablement pratiques.\"\r\n\r\n    _Annales d'Hygiène Publique et de Médecine Légale_,\r\n    Tome xxvi., p. 583.\r\n\r\n\"La première édition du traité de M. Bateman avait été très\r\nfavorablement accueillie du public médical. La seconde édition,\r\naugmentée d'observations nouvelles, tenue au courant des progrès de la\r\nscience, n'aura pas moins de succès.\r\n\r\n\"Les premiers chapitres du volume sont consacrés a l'historique de\r\nl'aphasie et de la localisation de la faculté du langage articulé:\r\nl'auteur y rend pleine justice aux auteurs français, Broca, Trousseau,\r\nCharcot, &c., qui ont les premiers soulevé cette question délicate. Le\r\nchapitre iv. contient les observations personnelles de M. Bateman dont\r\nbeaucoup ont été recueillies dans son service à l'hôpital de Norfolk\r\net Norwich. Dans le chapitre suivant M. Bateman étudie et analyse la\r\nfaculté de parler, la parole articulée, résume les opinions de Max\r\nMuller, de Whitney, de Parchappe, &c. La parole est un acte\r\nphysico-psychique, composé de deux éléments, l'un somatique et\r\nmatériel, le mouvement, l'autre psychique, la parole interne, le\r\nλογος. Le langage est donc une fonction à la fois impressive\r\net expressive. La fonction impressive nécessite l'action de l'ouïe, de\r\nla vue ou d'un des sens, c'est la fonction sensorielle du langage;\r\nl'autre résulte d'une action musculaire, et constitue la fonction\r\nmotrice. Le langage articulé est l'apanage de l'homme seul.\r\n\r\n\"L'auteur décrit ensuite le mécanisme du langage, les organes de la\r\nvoix, le larynx; il étudie plus loin les différents types de langage;\r\nil montre que le langage articulé n'est pas le seul moyen que l'homme\r\nait d'exprimer sa pensée, il oppose le langage naturel au langage\r\nartificiel ou acquis, &c.\r\n\r\n\"Avec les chapitres suivants nous entrons dans la pathologie; M.\r\nBateman y décrit l'agraphie, l'aphasie dans toutes ses formes et\r\nvariétés. Il étudie ses causes, son diagnostic, son pronostic, son\r\ntraitement, son importance en médecine légale; enfin dans les derniers\r\nchapitres, M. Bateman s'occupe plus généralement de la localisation de\r\nla parole, et il résume les opinions des physiologistes les plus\r\ncélèbres depuis Gall jusqu'à Barnard Davis, Flower, Broca, &c.\"\r\n\r\n    _Comptes Rendus de la Société de Biologie_, Tome ii., No. 30.\r\n\r\n\"Au nom de l'auteur, le Dr. Frédéric Bateman, je présente à la Société\r\nun exemplaire de la seconde édition de son célèbre ouvrage sur\r\nl'aphasie. Les progrès considérables de nos connaissances, durant les\r\nvingt dernières années, sur les diverses espèces d'aphasie, sont\r\nexposés avec une grande clarté dans ce remarquable ouvrage aussi\r\nsavant qu'original, le plus complet qui existe sur la matière dont il\r\ntraite.

Im 4. Kapitel finden wir einige\r\neigene Beobachtungen des Autors. Kapitel 5 bringt die Definition der\r\nAphasie und die Entwickelungsgeschichte der Sprache. In Kapitel 6 und\r\n7 wird die Klassification der Sprache abgehandelt. Mitunter fehlen dem\r\nSprechenden nur die Substantiva, oder ganz bestimmte Worte, oder eine\r\nbestimmte Landessprache; in anderen Fällen von Aphasie werden nur\r\nbestimmte Phrasen beständig wiederholt etc. Auch die Schriftstörungen\r\nund die Anomalien der Mimik und Zeichensprache bei der Aphasie werden\r\nbesprochen; ferner die Affectausdrücke, Bedeutung der Injectionen, der\r\nhysterische Mutismus u. s. w. Im 8. Kapitel werden die ätiologischen\r\nFactoren der Aphasie hervorgehoben: Angeborene Stummheit,\r\nSprachstörungen der Idioten; Aphasie in Folge von Exostosen der\r\nSchädelknochen; Thrombose, Embolie der Gehirnarterien; ischämische\r\nErweichung, etc. Kapitel 9 behandelt die Diagnose, Prognose, Therapie,\r\nwährend im folgenden Kapitel die Rechtsfragen der Aphasischen erörtert\r\nwerden. In den letzten Kapiteln 11 und 12 geht der Verf., soweit die\r\nbetreffenden Gegenstände zur Aphasie in Beziehung treten, auf den\r\nHypnotismus ein, den anatomischen Sitz, die mikroskopischen Befunde,\r\nauf die Physiologie und Psychologie der Sprache, die experimentelle\r\nPathologie, die allgemeine Anthropologie, auf die Hirnchemie etc.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN & COLONIAL NOTICES.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Montreal Medical Journal_.\r\n\r\n\"The learned author of this work was the first to publish in English a\r\ntreatise on Aphasia. Not the least interesting part of the work is\r\nthat referring to the author's own contributions. The subject of\r\nAphasia is treated in all its relations, and in all its forms and\r\nmodifications.\r\n\r\n\"There is certainly no work in the English language which gives such a\r\nfull and accurate account of this abstruse subject. The author is to\r\nbe congratulated on having produced a work that will be a standard\r\nauthority on loss of speech.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _American Journal of Insanity_.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this book of Dr. Bateman's is\r\nthe singular spirit of scientific fairness that characterizes its\r\nevery utterance, so conspicuous and so anomalous is this, that it is\r\nworthy of special mention.\r\n\r\n\"It is a book which no student of medicine, of language, or of\r\npsychology can afford to be without.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _New York Medico-Legal Journal_.\r\n\r\n\"This is a book which will interest all neurologists, and reflects\r\ngreat credit on its author, for the research and care, as well as\r\nfairness of the discussion, which is raised between the several\r\nschools of thought.\r\n\r\n\"That part of the work most interesting to us is the chapter on the\r\nMedical Jurisprudence of Aphasia, the hints on criminal Anthropology,\r\nthe Chemistry of the Brain, and the question of Localisation of the\r\nFaculty of Speech.\r\n\r\n\"The work on the whole is a very valuable contribution to the\r\nliterature of Aphasia, and will be welcomed by all Neurologists.\"\r\n\r\n    From the _Alienist and Neurologist_.\r\n\r\n\"This is a valuable contribution to the history and literature of the\r\nsubject, a subject not yet too old to have lost its interest to either\r\nprofessional or lay reader.\r\n\r\n\"No library of the literature of Aphasia, however, would be complete\r\nwithout this book.
