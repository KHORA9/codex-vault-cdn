I have written a great many magazine\r\narticles, but never one which attracted so much attention as this. The\r\nfirst day the magazine was on the news-stands, I received a telegram\r\nfrom a man in Washington who had begun to fast and wanted some advice;\r\nand thereafter I received ten or twenty letters a day from people\r\nwho had questions to ask or experiences to narrate. At the date of\r\nwriting eight months have passed, and the flood has not yet stopped.\r\nThe editors of the _Cosmopolitan_ also tell me that they have never\r\nreceived so many letters about an article in their experience. Still\r\nmore significant was the number of reports which began to appear in\r\nthe news columns of papers all over the country, telling of people who\r\nwere fasting. From various sources I have received about fifty such\r\nclippings, and few but reported benefit to the faster.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of this interest, I was asked by the _Cosmopolitan_\r\nto write another article, which appeared in the issue of February,\r\n1911. The present volume is made up from these two articles, with the\r\naddition of some notes and comments, and some portions of articles\r\ncontributed to the _Physical Culture_ magazine, of the editorial\r\nstaff of which I am a member. It was my intention at first to work\r\nthis matter into a connected whole, but upon rereading the articles\r\nI decided that it would be better to publish them as they stood. The\r\njournalistic style has its advantages; and repetitions may perhaps be\r\npardoned in the case of a topic which is so new to almost every one.\r\n\r\nI have reproduced in the book several photographs of myself which\r\nappeared in the magazine articles. Ordinarily one does not print his\r\npicture in his own books; but when it comes to fasting there are many\r\n\"doubting Thomases,\" and we are told that \"seeing is believing.\"\r\nThe two photographs of myself which appear as a frontispiece afford\r\nevidence of a really extraordinary physical recuperation; and the\r\nreader has my word for it that there was nothing in my way of life to\r\naccount for it, except three fasts, of a total of thirty days.\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter to be referred to. Several years ago I\r\npublished a book entitled \"Good Health,\" written in collaboration\r\nwith a friend. I could not express my own views fully in that book,\r\nand on certain points where I differed with my collaborator, I have\r\ncome since to differ still more. The book contains a great deal of\r\nuseful information; but later experience has convinced me that its\r\nviews on the all-important subject of diet are erroneous. My present\r\nopinions I have given in this book. I am not saying this to apologize\r\nfor an inconsistency, but to record a growth. In those days I believed\r\nsomething, because other people told me; to-day I know something else,\r\nbecause I have tried it upon myself.\r\n\r\nMy object in publishing this book is two-fold: first, to have something\r\nto which I can refer people, so that I will not have to answer half\r\na dozen \"fasting letters\" every day for the rest of my life; and\r\nsecond, in the hope of attracting sufficient attention to the subject\r\nto interest some scientific men in making a real investigation of it.\r\nTo-day we know certain facts about what is called \"autointoxication\";\r\nwe know them because Metchnikoff, Pawlow and others have made a\r\nthorough-going inquiry into the subject. I believe that the subject of\r\nfasting is one of just as great importance. I have stated facts in this\r\nbook about myself; and I have quoted many letters which are genuine and\r\nbeyond dispute. The cures which they record are altogether without\r\nprecedent, I think. The reader will find in the course of the book\r\n(page 63) a tabulation of the results of 277 cases of fasting. In this\r\nnumber of desperate cases, there were only about half a dozen definite\r\nand unexplained failures reported. Surely it cannot be that medical men\r\nand scientists will continue for much longer to close their eyes to\r\nfacts of such vital significance as this.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to be the discoverer of the fasting cure. The subject\r\nwas discussed by Dr. E. H. Dewey in books which were published thirty\r\nor forty years ago. For the reader who cares to investigate further,\r\nI mention the following books, which I have read with interest and\r\nprofit. I recommend them, although, needless to say, I do not agree\r\nwith everything that is in them: \"Fasting for the Cure of Disease,\"\r\nby Dr. L. B. Hazzard; \"Perfect Health,\" by C. C. Haskell; \"Fasting,\r\nHydrotherapy and Exercise,\" by Bernarr Macfadden; \"Fasting, Vitality\r\nand Nutrition,\" by Hereward Carrington. Also I will add that Mr. C. C.\r\nHaskell, of Norwich, Conn., conducts a correspondence-school dealing\r\nwith the subject of fasting, and that fasting patients are taken\r\ncharge of at Bernarr Macfadden's Healthatorium, 42d Street and Grand\r\nBoulevard, Chicago, Ill., and by Dr. Linda B. Hazzard, of Seattle,\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FASTING CURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECT HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nPerfect Health!\r\n\r\nHave you any conception of what the phrase means? Can you form any\r\nimage of what would be your feeling if every organ in your body were\r\nfunctioning perfectly? Perhaps you can go back to some day in your\r\nyouth, when you got up early in the morning and went for a walk, and\r\nthe spirit of the sunrise got into your blood, and you walked faster,\r\nand took deep breaths, and laughed aloud for the sheer happiness of\r\nbeing alive in such a world of beauty. And now you are grown older--and\r\nwhat would you give for the secret of that glorious feeling? What\r\nwould you say if you were told that you could bring it back and keep\r\nit, not only for mornings, but for afternoons and evenings, and not\r\nas something accidental and mysterious, but as something which you\r\nyourself have created, and of which you are completely master?\r\n\r\nThis is not an introduction to a new device in patent medicine\r\nadvertising. I have nothing to sell, and no process patented. It is\r\nsimply that for ten years I have been studying the ill health of myself\r\nand of the men and women around me. And I have found the cause and the\r\nremedy. I have not only found good health, but perfect health; I have\r\nfound a new state of being, a new potentiality of life; a sense of\r\nlightness and cleanness and joyfulness, such as I did not know could\r\nexist in the human body. \"I like to meet you on the street,\" said a\r\nfriend the other day. \"You walk as if it were such fun!\"\r\n\r\nI look about me in the world, and nearly everybody I know is sick. I\r\ncould name one after another a hundred men and women, who are doing\r\nvital work for progress and carrying a cruel handicap of physical\r\nsuffering. For instance, I am working for social justice, and I\r\nhave comrades whose help is needed every hour, and they are ill!\r\nIn one single week's newspapers last spring I read that one was\r\ndying of kidney trouble, that another was in hospital from nervous\r\nbreakdown, and that a third was ill with ptomaine poisoning. And in my\r\ncorrespondence I am told that another of my dearest friends has only a\r\nyear to live; that another heroic man is a nervous wreck, craving for\r\ndeath; and that a third is tortured by bilious headaches.[1] And there\r\nis not one of these people whom I could not cure if I had him alone for\r\na couple of weeks; no one of them who would not in the end be walking\r\ndown the street \"as if it were such fun!\"\r\n\r\nI propose herein to tell the story of my discovery of health, and I\r\nshall not waste much time in apologizing for the intimate nature of\r\nthe narrative. It is no pleasure for me to tell over the tale of my\r\nheadaches or to discuss my unruly stomach. I cannot take any case but\r\nmy own, because there is no case about which I can speak with such\r\nauthority. To be sure, I might write about it in the abstract, and\r\nin veiled terms. But in that case the story would lose most of its\r\nconvincingness, and so of its usefulness. I might tell it without\r\nsigning my name to it. But there are a great many people who have read\r\nmy books and will believe what I tell them, who would not take the\r\ntrouble to read an article without a name. Mr. Horace Fletcher has set\r\nus all an example in this matter. He has written several volumes about\r\nhis individual digestion, with the result that literally millions of\r\npeople have been helped. In the same way I propose to put my case on\r\nrecord. The reader will find that it is a typical case, for I made\r\nabout every mistake that a man could make, and tried every remedy, old\r\nand new, that anybody had to offer me.\r\n\r\nI spent my boyhood in a well-to-do family, in which good eating was\r\nregarded as a social grace and the principal interest in life. We had a\r\ncolored woman to prepare our food, and another to serve it. It was not\r\nconsidered fitting for children to drink liquor, but they had hot bread\r\nthree times a day, and they were permitted to revel in fried chicken\r\nand rich gravies and pastries, fruit cake and candy and ice-cream.\r\nEvery Sunday I would see my grandfather's table with a roast of beef\r\nat one end, and a couple of chickens at the other, and a cold ham at\r\none side; at Christmas and Thanksgiving the energies of the whole\r\nestablishment would be given up to the preparation of delicious foods.\r\nAnd later on, when I came to New York, I considered it necessary to\r\nhave such food; even when I was a poor student, living on four dollars\r\na week, I spent more than three of it on eatables.\r\n\r\nI was an active and fairly healthy boy; at twenty I remember saying\r\nthat I had not had a day's serious sickness in fourteen years. Then\r\nI wrote my first novel, working sixteen or eighteen hours a day for\r\nseveral months, camping out, and living mostly out of a frying-pan.\r\nAt the end I found that I was seriously troubled with dyspepsia; and\r\nit was worse the next year, after the second book. I went to see a\r\nphysician, who gave me some red liquid, which magically relieved the\r\nconsequences of doing hard brain-work after eating. So I went on for a\r\nyear or two more, and then I found that the artificially-digested food\r\nwas not being eliminated from my system with sufficient regularity. So\r\nI went to another physician, who gave my malady another name, and gave\r\nme another medicine, and put off the time of reckoning a little while\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nI have never in my life used tea or coffee, alcohol or tobacco; but\r\nfor seven or eight years I worked under heavy pressure all the time,\r\nand ate very irregularly, and ate unwholesome food. So I began to\r\nhave headaches once in a while, and to notice that I was abnormally\r\nsensitive to colds. I considered these maladies natural to mortals, and\r\nI would always attribute them to some specific accident. I would say,\r\n\"I've been knocking about down town all day\"; or, \"I was out in the\r\nhot sun\"; or, \"I lay on the damp ground.\" I found that if I sat in a\r\ndraught for even a minute I was certain to \"catch a cold.\" I found also\r\nthat I had sore throat and tonsilitis once or twice every winter; also,\r\nnow and then, the grippe. There were times when I did not sleep well;\r\nand as all this got worse, I would have to drop all my work and try to\r\nrest. The first time I did this a week or two was sufficient; but later\r\non a month or two was necessary, and then several months.\r\n\r\nThe year I wrote \"The Jungle\" I had my first summer cold. It was haying\r\ntime on a farm, and I thought it was a kind of hay-fever. I would\r\nsneeze for hours in perfect torment, and this lasted for a month, until\r\nI went away to the sea-shore. This happened again the next summer, and\r\nalso another very painful experience; a nerve in a tooth died, and I\r\nhad to wait three days for the pain to \"localize,\" and then had the\r\ntooth drilled out, and staggered home, and was ill in bed for a week\r\nwith chills and fever, and nausea and terrible headaches. I mention all\r\nthese unpleasant details so that the reader may understand the state\r\nof wretchedness to which I had come. At the same time, also, I had a\r\ngreat deal of distressing illness in my family; my wife seldom had a\r\nweek without suffering, and my little boy had pneumonia one winter, and\r\ncroup the next, and whooping-cough in the summer, with the inevitable\r\n\"colds\" scattered in between.\r\n\r\nAfter the Helicon Hall fire I realized that I was in a bad way, and\r\nfor the two years following I gave a good part of my time to trying\r\nto find out how to preserve my health. I went to Battle Creek, and\r\nto Bermuda, and to the Adirondacks; I read the books of all the new\r\ninvestigators of the subject of hygiene, and tried out their theories\r\nreligiously. I had discovered Horace Fletcher a couple of years\r\nbefore. Mr. Fletcher's idea is, in brief, to chew your food, and chew\r\nit thoroughly; to extract from each particle of food the maximum of\r\nnutriment, and to eat only as much as your system actually needs. This\r\nwas a very wonderful idea to me, and I fell upon it with the greatest\r\nenthusiasm. All the physicians I had known were men who tried to cure\r\nme when I fell sick, but here was a man who was studying how to stay\r\nwell. I have to find fault with Mr. Fletcher's system, and so I must\r\nmake clear at the outset how much I owe to it. It set me upon the right\r\ntrack--it showed me the goal, even if it did not lead me to it. It made\r\nclear to me that all my various ailments were symptoms of one great\r\ntrouble, the presence in my body of the poisons produced by superfluous\r\nand unassimilated food, and that in adjusting the quantity of food to\r\nthe body's exact needs lay the secret of perfect health.\r\n\r\nIt was only in the working out of the theory that I fell down. Mr.\r\nFletcher told me that \"Nature\" would be my guide, and that if only I\r\nmasticated thoroughly, instinct would select the foods. I found that,\r\nso far as my case was concerned, my \"nature\" was hopelessly perverted.\r\nI invariably preferred unwholesome foods--apple pie, and toast soaked\r\nin butter, and stewed fruit with quantities of cream and sugar. Nor did\r\n\"Nature\" kindly tell me when to stop, as she apparently does some other\r\n\"Fletcherites\"; no matter how much I chewed, if I ate all I wanted I\r\nate too much. And when I realized this, and tried to stop it, I went,\r\nin my ignorance, to the other extreme, and lost fourteen pounds in as\r\nmany days. Again, Mr. Fletcher taught me to remove all the \"unchewable\"\r\nparts of the food--the skins of fruit, etc. The result of this is\r\nthere is nothing to stimulate the intestines, and the waste remains in\r\nthe body for many days. Mr. Fletcher says this does not matter, and\r\nhe appears to prove that it has not mattered in his case. But I found\r\nthat it mattered very seriously in my case; it was not until I became\r\na \"Fletcherite\" that my headaches became hopeless and that sluggish\r\nintestines became one of my chronic complaints.\r\n\r\nI next read the books of Metchnikoff and Chittenden, who showed me\r\njust how my ailments came to be. The unassimilated food lies in the\r\ncolon, and bacteria swarm in it, and the poisons they produce are\r\nabsorbed into the system. I had bacteriological examinations made in\r\nmy own case, and I found that when I was feeling well the number of\r\nthese toxin-producing germs was about six billions to the ounce of\r\nintestinal contents; and when, a few days later, I had a headache, the\r\nnumber was a hundred and twenty billions. Here was my trouble under the\r\nmicroscope, so to speak.\r\n\r\nThese tests were made at the Battle Creek Sanitarium, where I went\r\nfor a long stay. I tried their system of water cure, which I found a\r\nwonderful stimulant to the eliminative organs; but I discovered that,\r\nlike all other stimulants, it leaves you in the end just where you\r\nwere. My health was improved at the sanitarium, but a week after I left\r\nI was down with the grippe again.\r\n\r\nI gave the next year of my life to trying to restore my health. I spent\r\nthe winter in Bermuda and the summer in the Adirondacks, both of them\r\nfamous health resorts, and during the entire time I lived an absolutely\r\nhygienic life. I did not work hard, and I did not worry, and I did not\r\nthink about my health except when I had to. I lived in the open air\r\nall the time, and I gave most of the day to vigorous exercise--tennis,\r\nwalking, boating and swimming. I mention this specifically, so that\r\nthe reader may perceive that I had eliminated all other factors of\r\nill-health, and appreciate to the full my statement that at the end of\r\nthe year's time my general health was worse than ever before.\r\n\r\nI was all right so long as I played tennis all day or climbed\r\nmountains. The trouble came when I settled down to do brain-work. And\r\nfrom this I saw perfectly clearly that I was over-eating; there was\r\nsurplus food to be burned up, and when it was not burned up it poisoned\r\nme. But how was I to stop when I was hungry? I tried giving up all the\r\nthings I liked and of which I ate most; but that did no good, because I\r\nhad such a complacent appetite--I would immediately take to liking the\r\nother things! I thought that I had an abnormal appetite, the result of\r\nmy early training; but how was I ever to get rid of it?\r\n\r\nI must not give the impression that I was a conspicuously hearty eater.\r\nOn the contrary, I ate far less than most people eat. But that was no\r\nconsolation to me. I had wrecked myself by years of overwork, and so\r\nI was more sensitive. The other people were going to pieces by slow\r\nstages, I could see; but I was already in pieces.\r\n\r\nSo matters stood when I chanced to meet a lady, whose radiant\r\ncomplexion and extraordinary health were a matter of remark to\r\neveryone. I was surprised to hear that for ten or fifteen years, and\r\nuntil quite recently, she had been a bed-ridden invalid. She had lived\r\nthe lonely existence of a pioneer's wife, and had raised a family under\r\nconditions of shocking ill-health. She had suffered from sciatica and\r\nacute rheumatism; from a chronic intestinal trouble which the doctors\r\ncalled \"intermittent peritonitis\"; from intense nervous weakness,\r\nmelancholy, and chronic catarrh, causing deafness. And this was the\r\nwoman who rode on horseback with me up Mount Hamilton, in California, a\r\ndistance of twenty-eight miles, in one of the most terrific rain-storms\r\nI have ever witnessed! We had two untamed young horses, and only\r\nleather bits to control them with, and we were pounded and flung\r\nabout for six mortal hours, which I shall never forget if I live to\r\nbe a hundred. And this woman, when she took the ride, had not eaten a\r\nparticle of food for four days previously!\r\n\r\nThat was the clue to her escape: she had cured herself by a fast.\r\nShe had abstained from food for eight days, and all her troubles had\r\nfallen from her. Afterwards she had taken her eldest son, a senior\r\nat Stanford, and another friend of his, and fasted twelve days with\r\nthem, and cured them of nervous dyspepsia. And then she had taken a\r\nwoman friend, the wife of a Stanford professor, and cured her of\r\nrheumatism by a week's fast. I had heard of the fasting cure, but this\r\nwas the first time I had met with it. I was too much burdened with\r\nwork to try it just then, but I began to read up on the subject--the\r\nbooks of Dr. Dewey, Dr. Hazzard and Mr. Carrington. Coming home from\r\nCalifornia I got a sunstroke on the Gulf of Mexico, and spent a week in\r\nhospital at Key West, and that seemed to give the _coup de grace_ to my\r\nlong-suffering stomach. After another spell of hard work I found myself\r\nunable to digest corn-meal mush and milk; and so I was ready for a fast.\r\n\r\nI began. The fast has become a commonplace to me now; but I will assume\r\nthat it is as new and as startling to the reader as it was to myself at\r\nfirst, and will describe my sensations at length.\r\n\r\nI was very hungry for the first day--the unwholesome, ravening sort\r\nof hunger that all dyspeptics know. I had a little hunger the second\r\nmorning, and thereafter, to my very great astonishment, no hunger\r\nwhatever--no more interest in food than if I had never known the\r\ntaste of it. Previous to the fast I had had a headache every day\r\nfor two or three weeks. It lasted through the first day and then\r\ndisappeared--never to return. I felt very weak the second day, and a\r\nlittle dizzy on arising. I went out of doors and lay in the sun all\r\nday, reading; and the same for the third and fourth days--intense\r\nphysical lassitude, but with great clearness of mind. After the fifth\r\nday I felt stronger, and walked a good deal, and I also began some\r\nwriting. No phase of the experience surprised me more than the activity\r\nof my mind: I read and wrote more than I had dared to do for years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nDuring the first four days I lost fifteen pounds in weight--something\r\nwhich, I have since learned, was a sign of the extremely poor state of\r\nmy tissues. Thereafter I lost only two pounds in eight days--an equally\r\nunusual phenomenon. I slept well throughout the fast. About the middle\r\nof each day I would feel weak, but a massage and a cold shower would\r\nrefresh me. Towards the end I began to find that in walking about I\r\nwould grow tired in the legs, and as I did not wish to lie in bed I\r\nbroke the fast after the twelfth day with some orange-juice.\r\n\r\nI took the juice of a dozen oranges during two days, and then went on\r\nthe milk diet, as recommended by Bernarr Macfadden. I took a glassful\r\nof warm milk every hour the first day, every three-quarters of an hour\r\nthe next day, and finally every half-hour--or eight quarts a day. This\r\nis, of course, much more than can be assimilated, but the balance\r\nserves to flush the system out. The tissues are bathed in nutriment,\r\nand an extraordinary recuperation is experienced. In my own case I\r\ngained four and a half pounds in one day--the third--and gained a total\r\nof thirty-two pounds in twenty-four days.\r\n\r\nMy sensations on this milk diet were almost as interesting as on the\r\nfast. In the first place, there was an extraordinary sense of peace and\r\ncalm, as if every weary nerve in the body were purring like a cat under\r\na stove. Next there was the keenest activity of mind--I read and wrote\r\nincessantly. And, finally, there was a perfectly ravenous desire for\r\nphysical work. In the old days I had walked long distances and climbed\r\nmountains, but always with reluctance and from a sense of compulsion.\r\nNow, after the cleaning-out of the fast, I would go into a gymnasium\r\nand do work which would literally have broken my back before, and I\r\ndid it with intense enjoyment, and with amazing results. The muscles\r\nfairly leaped out upon my body; I suddenly discovered the possibility\r\nof becoming an athlete. I had always been lean and dyspeptic-looking,\r\nwith what my friends called a \"spiritual\" expression; I now became as\r\nround as a butter-ball, and so brown and rosy in the face that I was a\r\njoke to all who saw me.\r\n\r\nI had not taken what is called a \"complete\" fast--that is, I had not\r\nwaited until hunger returned. Therefore I began again. I intended only\r\na short fast, but I found that hunger ceased again, and, much to my\r\nsurprise, I had none of the former weakness. I took a cold bath and\r\na vigorous rub twice a day; I walked four miles every morning, and\r\ndid light gymnasium work, and with nothing save a slight tendency to\r\nchilliness to let me know that I was fasting. I lost nine pounds in\r\neight days, and then went for a week longer on oranges and figs, and\r\nmade up most of the weight on these.\r\n\r\nI shall always remember with amusement the anxious caution with which\r\nI now began to taste the various foods which before had caused me\r\ntrouble. Bananas, acid fruits, peanut butter--I tried them one by one,\r\nand then in combination, and so realized with a thrill of exultation\r\nthat every trace of my old trouble was gone. Formerly I had had to lie\r\ndown for an hour or two after meals; now I could do whatever I chose.\r\nFormerly I had been dependent upon all kinds of laxative preparations;\r\nnow I forgot about them. I no longer had headaches. I went bareheaded\r\nin the rain, I sat in cold draughts of air, and was apparently immune\r\nto colds. And, above all, I had that marvellous, abounding energy, so\r\nthat whenever I had a spare minute or two I would begin to stand on\r\nmy head, or to \"chin\" myself, or do some other \"stunt,\" from sheer\r\nexuberance of animal spirits.\r\n\r\nFor several months after this experience I lived upon a diet of raw\r\nfoods exclusively--mainly nuts and fruits. I had been led to regard\r\nthis as the natural diet for human beings; and I found that so long\r\nas I was leading an active life the results were most satisfactory.\r\nThey were satisfactory also in the case of my wife, and still more\r\nso in the case of my little boy; the amount of work and bother thus\r\nsaved in the household may be imagined. But when I came to settle down\r\nto a long period of hard and continuous writing, I found that I had\r\nnot sufficient bodily energy to digest these raw foods. I resorted\r\nto fasting and milk alternately--and that is well enough for a time,\r\nbut it proves a nervous strain in the end. Recently a friend called\r\nmy attention to the late Dr. Salisbury's book, \"The Relation of\r\nAlimentation to Disease.\" Dr. Salisbury recommends a diet of broiled\r\nbeef and hot water as the solution of most of the problems of the\r\nhuman body; and it may be believed that I, who had been a rigid and\r\nenthusiastic vegetarian for three or four years, found this a startling\r\nidea. However, I make a specialty of keeping an open mind, and I set\r\nout to try the Salisbury system. I am sorry to have to say that it\r\nseems to be a good one; sorry, because the vegetarian way of life is\r\nso obviously the cleaner and more humane and more convenient. But it\r\nseems to me that I am able to do more work and harder work with my mind\r\nwhile eating beefsteaks than under any other _régime_; and while this\r\ncontinues to be the case there will be one less vegetarian in the world.\r\n\r\nThe fast is to me the key to eternal youth, the secret of perfect and\r\npermanent health. I would not take anything in all the world for my\r\nknowledge of it. It is Nature's safety-valve, an automatic protection\r\nagainst disease. I do not venture to assert that I am proof against\r\nvirulent diseases, such as smallpox or typhoid. I know one ardent\r\nphysical culturist, a physician, who takes typhoid germs at intervals\r\nin order to prove his immunity, but I should not care to go that far;\r\nit is enough for me to know that I am proof against all the common\r\ninfections which plague us, and against all the \"chronic\" troubles.\r\nAnd I shall continue so just as long as I stand by my present resolve,\r\nwhich is to fast at the slightest hint of any symptom of ill-being--a\r\ncold or a headache, a feeling of depression, or a coated tongue, or a\r\nscratch on the finger which does not heal quickly.\r\n\r\nThose who have made a study of the fast explain its miracles in the\r\nfollowing way: Superfluous nutriment is taken into the system and\r\nferments, and the body is filled with a greater quantity of poisonous\r\nmatter than the organs of elimination can handle. The result is the\r\nclogging of these organs and of the blood-vessels--such is the meaning\r\nof headaches and rheumatism, arteriosclerosis, paralysis, apoplexy,\r\nBright's disease, cirrhosis, etc. And by impairing the blood and\r\nlowering the vitality, this same condition prepares the system for\r\ninfection--for \"colds,\" or pneumonia, or tuberculosis, or any of the\r\nfevers. As soon as the fast begins, and the first hunger has been\r\nwithstood, the secretions cease, and the whole assimilative system,\r\nwhich takes so much of the energies of the body, goes out of business.\r\nThe body then begins a sort of house-cleaning, which must be helped by\r\nan enema and a bath daily, and, above all, by copious water-drinking.\r\nThe tongue becomes coated, the breath and the perspiration offensive;\r\nand this continues until the diseased matter has been entirely cast\r\nout, when the tongue clears and hunger reasserts itself in unmistakable\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe loss of weight during the fast is generally about a pound a day.\r\nThe fat is used first, and after that the muscular tissue; true\r\nstarvation begins only when the body has been reduced to the skeleton\r\nand the viscera. Fasts of forty and fifty days are now quite common--I\r\nhave met several who have taken them.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the fast is a cure for both emaciation and\r\nobesity. After a complete fast the body will come to its ideal weight.\r\nPeople who are very stout will not regain their weight; while people\r\nwho are under weight may gain a pound or more a day for a month. There\r\nare two dangers to be feared in fasting. The first is that of fear. I\r\ndo not say this as a jest. No one should begin to fast until he has\r\nread up on the subject and convinced himself that it is the thing to\r\ndo; if possible he should have with him someone who has already had the\r\nexperience. He should not have about him terrified aunts and cousins\r\nwho will tell him that he looks like a corpse, that his pulse is below\r\nforty, and that his heart may stop beating in the night. I took a\r\nfast of three days out in California; on the third day I walked about\r\nfifteen miles, off and on, and, except that I was restless, I never\r\nfelt better. And then in the evening I came home and read about the\r\nMessina earthquake, and how the relief ships arrived, and the wretched\r\nsurvivors crowded down to the water's edge and tore each other like\r\nwild beasts in their rage of hunger. The paper set forth, in horrified\r\nlanguage, that some of them had been seventy-two hours without food.\r\nI, as I read, had also been seventy-two hours without food; and the\r\ndifference was simply that they thought they were starving. And if at\r\nsome crisis during a long fast, when you feel nervous and weak and\r\ndoubting, some people with stronger wills than your own are able to\r\narouse in you the terrors of the earthquake survivors, they can cause\r\ntheir most direful anticipations to be realized.\r\n\r\nThe other danger is in breaking the fast. A person breaking a long\r\nfast should regard himself as if he were liable to seizures of violent\r\ninsanity. I know a man who fasted fifty days, and then ate half a\r\ndozen figs, and caused intestinal abrasions from which he lost a great\r\ndeal of blood. I would dwell more upon this topic were it not for my\r\ndiscovery of the \"milk diet.\" When you drink a glass of milk every\r\nhalf-hour you have no chance to get really hungry, and so you glide, as\r\nif by magic, from a condition of extreme emaciation to one of blooming\r\nrotundity. But very frequently the milk diet disagrees with people; and\r\nthese have to break the fast with very small quantities of the simplest\r\nfoods--fruit juices and meat broths for the first two or three days at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter by narrating the experiences of some other\r\npersons with the fasting cure. With the exception of one, the second\r\ncase, they are all people whom I know personally, and who have told me\r\ntheir stories with their own lips.\r\n\r\nFirst, I give the case of my wife. She has always been frail, and\r\nsubject to sore throats since girlhood. In the past five years\r\nshe has undergone three major surgical operations and had several\r\nserious illnesses besides. Two years ago she had a severe attack of\r\nappendicitis. The physician made a wrong diagnosis, and kept her alive\r\nfor about ten days with morphine. She was then too low to risk an\r\noperation, and was not expected to live. It was several months before\r\nshe was able to walk again, and she had never fully recovered from the\r\nexperience. When she began the fast she was suffering from serious\r\nstomach trouble, loss of weight, and neurasthenia.\r\n\r\nI did not think that she would be able to stand a fast. She had more\r\ntrouble than I--some nervousness, headache and nausea. But she stood\r\nit for ten days, when her tongue cleared suddenly. She had lost twelve\r\npounds, and she then gained twenty-two pounds in seventeen days. She\r\nthen took another fast of six days with me, and with no more trouble\r\nthan I experienced the second time--walking four miles every morning\r\nwith me. She is now a picture of health, and is engaged in accumulating\r\nmuscle with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nSecond, a man well on in life, who had always abused his health. He\r\nsuffered from asthma and dropsy, and was saturated with drugs. He\r\nhad not been able to lie down for several years. He weighed over 220\r\npounds, and his legs were \"like sacks of water, leaking continually.\"\r\nHis kidneys had refused to act, and after his doctors had tried all\r\nthe drugs they knew, he was told that he was dying. His brother, who\r\nnarrated the circumstances to me, persuaded him not to eat the supper\r\nthat was brought in to him, and so he lived through the night. He\r\nfasted seven days, and went for four weeks longer on a very light diet,\r\nand is now chopping wood and pitching hay upon his farm in Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThird, a young physician, as a college boy a physical wreck from\r\ndissipation, now twenty-four. \"A born neurastheniac.\" He was attacked\r\nby appendicitis twice in succession. He fasted five days after the\r\nlast attack, and six days later on. Gained thirty-five pounds, and is\r\na splendidly developed athlete; he runs five miles in 26 minutes 15\r\nseconds, and rode a wheel 500 miles in seven days.\r\n\r\nFourth, a young lady, who had suffered a nervous collapse caused by\r\noverwork and worry. The bones of her spine had softened; her hipbones\r\ntilted upwards three-quarters of an inch; she was \"barely able to\r\ncrawl on two sticks.\" She fasted ten days, and again eight days, and\r\ntook the milk diet for six weeks. I have seen her every day for the\r\nlast eight or ten weeks, and I do not think that I ever met a woman who\r\nimpressed me as possessing more superabundant and radiant health.\r\n\r\nFifth, a young man, injured in a railroad wreck; a rib broken and the\r\nouter lining of the lungs punctured. Still has an opening for drainage,\r\ncaused by chafing of the membranes. Suffered in succession attacks of\r\nbronchitis, typhoid, pneumonia and pleurisy. Was reduced from 186 to\r\n119 pounds, and had planned to take his life. Fasted six days, gained\r\ntwenty-seven pounds, and plays tennis vigorously, in spite of having an\r\nopening in his chest. Recently walked 442 miles in eleven days.\r\n\r\nSixth, a lady, married, and in middle life, a life-long sufferer\r\nfrom stomach trouble; had experienced six attacks of inflammatory\r\nrheumatism, resulting in valvular heart disease and the loss of the\r\nuse of her limbs. Fasted four times--four, eight, twenty-eight, and\r\nfourteen days. I can best describe her present condition by saying that\r\nall this summer she arose every morning at daybreak, walked four and a\r\nhalf miles, went for a swim, and then walked home for breakfast.\r\n\r\nSeventh, an Episcopal clergyman, who had suffered almost all his life\r\nfrom indigestion; had an acute attack of gastritis, followed by nervous\r\nprostration and complete breakdown. Specialists had diagnosed his case\r\nas \"prolapsed stomach and bowels, autointoxication and neurasthenia,\"\r\nand told him that he could not expect to get well in less than five\r\nyears. He was so emaciated that he could hardly creep around, and,\r\ndespite the fact that he had a wife and six children, was contemplating\r\nsuicide. He fasted eleven days, and then gained thirty pounds. I am\r\nprepared to testify that he is the most hard-working, cheerful and\r\nathletic clergyman it has ever been my fortune to meet.\r\n\r\nI have taken some trouble to investigate the subject of the fast, and\r\nto meet people who have been through the experience. I could give a\r\ndozen more cases such as the above if space permitted. I know one\r\nman who reduced his weight from 365 pounds to 235. I know one little\r\ngirl whose spine was bent in the shape of a letter U lying sideways,\r\nand who, by means of fasting and a diet of fruits exclusively, has\r\ncome four inches nearer to straightness in a few months. She has the\r\ncomplexion of perfect health, and is rapidly recovering the use of arms\r\nand legs, which were paralyzed years ago.\r\n\r\nThe reader may think that my enthusiasm over the fasting cure is due to\r\nmy imaginative temperament; I can only say that I have never yet met a\r\nperson who has given the fast a fair trial who does not describe his\r\nexperience in the same way. I have never heard of any harm resulting\r\nfrom it, save only in cases of tuberculosis, in which I have been told\r\nby one physician that people have lost weight and not regained it.\r\n\r\nI regard the fast as Nature's own remedy for all other diseases. It is\r\nthe only remedy which is based upon an understanding of the fundamental\r\nnature of disease. And I believe that when the glad tidings of its\r\nmiracles have reached the people it will lead to the throwing of 90\r\nper cent of our present _materia medica_ into the waste-basket. This\r\nmay be unwelcome to those physicians who are more concerned with their\r\nown income than they are with the health of their patients; but I\r\npersonally have never met any such physicians, and so I most earnestly\r\nurge it upon medical men to investigate the extraordinary and almost\r\nincredible facts about the fasting cure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after the above was completed the writer had another\r\ninteresting experience with the fast. He had occasion to do some work\r\nwhich kept him indoors for a couple of weeks, under considerable\r\nstrain; and after that to spend the greater part of a week in the\r\ndentist's chair suffering a good deal of pain; and finally to spend\r\ntwo days and nights in a railroad train. He arrived at his destination\r\nwith every symptom of what long and painful experience has taught him\r\nto recognize as a severe attack of the \"grippe.\" (The last attack laid\r\nhim up in hospital for a week, and left him so reduced that he could\r\nhardly stand.) On this occasion he fasted, and although circumstances\r\ncompelled him to be up and about during the entire time, every trace\r\nof ill-feeling had left him in two days. Having started, however, he\r\ncontinued the fast for twelve days. During this time he planned a play,\r\nand wrote two-thirds of it, and he has reason to think that it is as\r\ngood work as he has ever done. It is worth noting that on the eighth\r\nday he was strong enough to \"chin\" himself six times in succession,\r\nthough previous to the fasting treatment he had never in his life been\r\nable to do this more than once or twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n     A LETTER TO THE NEW YORK TIMES\r\n\r\n     (_unfit to print_)\r\n\r\n     ARDEN, DEL., May 31, 1910.\r\n\r\n     EDITOR OF THE _Times_, New York City,\r\n\r\n     DEAR SIR,--Some time ago your news columns contained a despatch to\r\n     the effect that three young ladies in Garden City, Long Island,\r\n     were undertaking a three days' fast as a result of reading a\r\n     magazine article recommending this measure. In your editorial\r\n     referring to this despatch, you say that the ladies are \"the\r\n     victims of a shallow and unscrupulous sensationalist.\" As I am the\r\n     writer of the magazine article in question, I presume that this\r\n     means me. I did not intend to make any reply to the remark, as I\r\n     figure that I must have long ago lost whatever reputation could\r\n     be taken from me by newspaper comments. Thinking the matter over,\r\n     however, I concluded that I would venture a mild protest, not on\r\n     my own account, but for the sake of the important discovery of\r\n     which I told in the article in question.\r\n\r\n     It is one of the privileges incidental to owning a newspaper that\r\n     one can call other people names with impunity, and can always have\r\n     the last word in any argument. Will, however, your sense of fair\r\n     play give me the privilege of asking you to state just what you\r\n     meant by the slur in question? In the magazine article I stated\r\n     that I had taken several fasts of ten or twelve days' duration,\r\n     with the result of a complete making over of my health. I presume\r\n     that the writer of the editorial had read the article before he\r\n     condemned it. Am I to understand that he got from the article the\r\n     impression that I was telling lies, and that I had never really\r\n     taken the fasts as I said I had taken them? Or was it his idea\r\n     that I exaggerated the benefits derived therefrom, in order to\r\n     make \"victims\" of the three young ladies in Garden City?\r\n\r\n     I might say that I took the fasts in question in an institution\r\n     where hundreds of people were fasting anywhere from three to fifty\r\n     days; that during the entire time I was under the observation of\r\n     many people; my weight was taken regularly every day, and all\r\n     the symptoms which I described were observed by physicians and\r\n     friends. May I also call attention to the fact that I published\r\n     in the article two photographs, one of which was taken four years\r\n     ago, and the other of which was taken after the fasting treatment?\r\n     The contrast between these two photographs was sufficiently\r\n     striking, it seems to me, to impress anyone. May I also call\r\n     attention to the fact that the article was found of sufficient\r\n     interest to be published in one of the most representative of\r\n     the English monthlies, the _Contemporary Review_? Also that the\r\n     _Contemporary Review_ appended to the article the testimony of\r\n     half a dozen people whose cases I had myself observed, and whose\r\n     letters I have in my possession?\r\n\r\n     I fully recognize the fact that many of the things for which\r\n     I stand as a writer are abhorrent to you, but surely that is\r\n     no reason for condemning recklessly and blindly an important\r\n     discovery concerning human health, simply because I happen\r\n     to be the person who is telling about it. Setting aside all\r\n     personalities, and simply in the interest of the discovery in\r\n     question, I respectfully invite you to make an investigation of\r\n     the claims which I have set forth in that article. Let me give you\r\n     the names of some people who have fasted either under my direction\r\n     or in my presence, and who will tell a representative of your\r\n     paper of the results it has brought to them. I can tell you of a\r\n     dozen such people. Also, perhaps by way of preliminary, you might\r\n     be willing to publish as an appendix to this letter of mine the\r\n     communication from another of my \"victims,\" omitting the name of\r\n     the writer unless you obtain permission to use it.\r\n\r\n     Yours truly,\r\n\r\n     UPTON SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAppended to the above was the letter which the reader will find in the\r\nAppendix, page 111. The _Times_ did not publish this letter, nor did it\r\npay any attention to several letters of protest which followed. I leave\r\nit to the reader to judge whether the silence of the paper was one of\r\ndignity or of fear. The following despatch from the New York _World_ of\r\nMay 17, 1910, records the experiences of the Garden City ladies, and\r\nmakes clear how much in need of sympathy my \"victims\" were.\r\n\r\n\r\n     All three of the young women are in rare spirits. They have gone\r\n     about their usual occupations and recreations, and Mrs. Trask\r\n     found time yesterday to talk about the single tax in the course of\r\n     a conversation that had to do primarily with her newer interest.\r\n\r\n     \"We are getting the most extraordinary number of letters about\r\n     this adventure of ours,\" Mrs. Trask said. \"They began to come the\r\n     first day, and to-day there were lots of them. They come from some\r\n     of the most unexpected places and they contain some of the most\r\n     unexpected things.\r\n\r\n     \"What most astonishes me is that of all those who write to tell\r\n     us that they have tried just what we are doing, not one has told\r\n     us of a failure. There isn't any reason why they shouldn't write\r\n     to say that we are foolish and that we can't hope to gain what we\r\n     want, but dozens of them have reiterated the promise that we'll\r\n     never regret having made our experiment.\r\n\r\n     \"One New York woman told us something that we had wondered about\r\n     more than once. Her husband had suffered greatly from rheumatism,\r\n     and finally he tried fasting. Not dieting like ourselves, but\r\n     fasting. He went without food of any kind, she said, for nineteen\r\n     days. He kept on at his work, too, which was the thing we had been\r\n     wondering about.\r\n\r\n     \"We've heard from another physician, too. He lives in Boston and\r\n     has made a specialty of dietetics. He warned us not to stick too\r\n     closely to milk, because we'd find that after a day or two it\r\n     would quit being of the service it had been at first. People we\r\n     never heard of tell us that thus and so was their experience, and\r\n     when we measure our own discoveries beside theirs we find new and\r\n     convincing evidence that we picked the true way to the end we\r\n     hoped to reach.\r\n\r\n     \"I know that for myself I'll have reason to be grateful always\r\n     that I took this up. We have been greatly benefited.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] The first two of these, Edmond Kelly and Ben Hanford, have since\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME NOTES ON FASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn relation to the article, \"Perfect Health,\" I received some six or\r\neight hundred letters from people who either had fasted, or desired to\r\nfast and sought for further information. The letters showed a general\r\nuniformity which made clear to me that I had not been sufficiently\r\nexplicit upon several important points.\r\n\r\nThe question most commonly asked was how long should one fast, and how\r\none should judge of the time to stop. I personally have never taken a\r\n\"complete fast,\" and so I hesitate in recommending this to any one. I\r\nhave fasted twelve days on two occasions. In both cases I broke my fast\r\nbecause I found myself feeling weak and I wanted to be about a good\r\ndeal. In neither case was I hungry, although hunger quickly returned.\r\nI was told by Bernarr Macfadden, and by some of his physicians, that\r\nthey got their best results from fasts of this length. I would not\r\nadvise a longer fast for any of the commoner ailments, such as stomach\r\nand intestinal trouble, headaches, constipation, colds and sore throat.\r\nLonger fasts, it seems to me, are for those who have really desperate\r\nailments, such deeply-rooted chronic diseases as Bright's disease,\r\ncirrhosis of the liver, rheumatism and cancer.\r\n\r\nOf course if a person has started on a fast and it is giving him no\r\ntrouble, there is no reason why it should not be continued; but I do\r\nnot in the least believe in a man's setting before himself the goal of\r\na forty or fifty days' fast and making a \"stunt\" out of it. I do not\r\nthink of the fast as a thing to be played with in that way. I do not\r\nbelieve in fasting for the fun of it, or out of curiosity. I do not\r\nadvise people to fast who have nothing the matter with them, and I do\r\nnot advise the fast as a periodical or habitual thing. A man who has\r\nto fast every now and then is like a person who should spend his time\r\nin sweeping rain water out of his house, instead of taking the trouble\r\nto repair his roof. If you have to fast every now and then, it is\r\nbecause the habits of your life are wrong, more especially because you\r\nare eating unwholesome foods. There were several people who wrote me\r\nasking about a fast, to whom my reply was that they should simply adopt\r\na rational diet; that I believed their troubles would all disappear\r\nwithout the need of a fast.\r\n\r\nSeveral people asked me if it would not be better for them to eat very\r\nlightly instead of fasting, or to content themselves with fasts of two\r\nor three days at frequent intervals. My reply to that is that I find it\r\nvery much harder to do that, because all the trouble in the fast occurs\r\nduring the first two or three days. It is during those days that you\r\nare hungry, and if you begin to eat just when your hunger is ceasing,\r\nyou have wasted all your efforts. In the same way, perhaps, it might\r\nbe a good thing to eat very lightly of fruit, instead of taking an\r\nabsolute fast--the only trouble is that I cannot do it. Again and again\r\nI have tried, but always with the same result: the light meals are\r\njust enough to keep me ravenously hungry, and inevitably I find myself\r\neating more and more. And it does me no good to call myself names about\r\nthis, I just do it, and keep on doing it; I have finally made up my\r\nmind that it is a fact of my nature. I used to try these \"fruit fasts\"\r\nunder Dr. Kellogg's advice. I could live on nothing but fruit for\r\nseveral days, but I would get so weak that I could not stand up--far\r\nweaker than I have ever become on an out-and-out fast.\r\n\r\nOne should drink all the water he possibly can while fasting, only not\r\ntaking too much at a time. I take a glass full every hour, at least;\r\nsometimes every half hour. It is a good plan to drink a great deal of\r\nwater at the outset, whenever meal time comes around, and one thinks of\r\nthe other folks beginning to eat. I drink the water cold, because it is\r\nless trouble, but if there is any hot water about, I prefer that. Hot\r\nwater between meals is an immensely valuable suggestion which I owe to\r\nDr. Salisbury.\r\n\r\nOne should take a bath every day while fasting. I prefer a warm bath\r\nfollowed by a cold shower. Also one should take a small enema. I find a\r\npint of cool water sufficient. I received several letters from people\r\nwho were greatly disturbed because of constipation during the fast.\r\nPeople apparently do not realize that while fasting there is very\r\nlittle to be eliminated from the body. (Of course, there are cases,\r\nespecially of people who have suffered from long continued intestinal\r\ntrouble, in which even after three or four weeks the enema continues to\r\nbring away quantities of dried and impacted fæces.)\r\n\r\nMany of the questions asked dealt with the manner of breaking the fast;\r\nI suppose because I had been particular to warn my readers that this\r\nwas the one danger point in the proceeding. I told of my experience\r\nwith the milk diet, and I received many inquiries about this. My answer\r\nwas to refer the writers to Bernarr Macfadden's pamphlet on the milk\r\ndiet, as I took this diet under his direction and have nothing to\r\nadd to his instructions. I might say, however, that I was never able\r\nto take the milk diet for any length of time but once, and that after\r\nmy first twelve-day fast. After my second fast it seemed to go wrong\r\nwith me, and I think the reason was that I did not begin it until a\r\nweek after breaking the fast, having got along on orange juice and\r\nfigs in the meantime. Also I tried on many occasions to take the milk\r\ndiet after a short fast of three or four days, and always the milk has\r\ndisagreed with me and poisoned me. I take this to mean that, in my own\r\ncase, at any rate, so much milk can only be absorbed when the tissues\r\nare greatly reduced; and I have known others who have had the same\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nWhile I was down in Alabama, I took a twelve-day fast, and at the end\r\nI was tempted by a delicious large Japanese persimmon, which had been\r\neyeing me from the pantry shelf during the whole twelve days. I ate\r\nthat persimmon--and I mention that it was thoroughly ripe; in spite\r\nof which fact it doubled me up with the most alarming cramp--and in\r\nconsequence I do not recommend persimmons for fasters. I know a friend\r\nwho had a similar experience from the juice of one orange; but he was\r\na man with whom acid fruit has always disagreed. I know another man\r\nwho broke his fast on a Hamburg steak; and this also is not to be\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIt has been my experience that immediately after a fast the stomach\r\nis very weak, and can easily be upset; also the peristaltic muscles\r\nare practically without power. It is, therefore, important to choose\r\nfoods which are readily digested, and also to continue to take the\r\nenema daily until the muscles have been sufficiently built up to make\r\na natural movement possible. The thing to do is to take orange juice\r\nor grape juice in small quantities for two or three days, and then go\r\ngradually upon the milk diet, beginning with half a glass of warm milk\r\nat a time. If the milk does not agree with you, you may begin carefully\r\nto add baked potatoes and rice and gruels and broths, if you must; but\r\ndon't forget the enema.\r\n\r\nPeople ask me in what diseases I recommend fasting. I recommend it for\r\nall diseases of which I have ever heard, with the exception of one in\r\nwhich I have heard of bad results--tuberculosis. Dr. Hazzard, in her\r\nbook, reports a case of the cure of this disease, but Mr. Macfadden\r\ntells me that he has known of several cases of people who have lost\r\ntheir weight and have not regained it. There is one cure quoted in the\r\nappendix to this volume.\r\n\r\nThe diseases for which fasting is most obviously to be recommended\r\nare all those of the stomach and intestines, which any one can see\r\nare directly caused by the presence of fermenting and putrefying food\r\nin the system. Next come all those complaints which are caused by the\r\npoisons derived from these foods in the blood and the eliminative\r\norgans: such are headaches and rheumatism, liver and kidney troubles,\r\nand of course all skin diseases. Finally, there are the fevers and\r\ninfectious diseases, which are caused by the invasion of the organism\r\nby foreign bacteria, which are enabled to secure a lodgment because of\r\nthe weakened and impure condition of the blood-stream. Such are the\r\n\"colds\" and fevers. In these latter cases nature tries to save us, for\r\nthere is immediately experienced a disinclination on the part of the\r\nsick person to take any sort of food; and there is no telling how many\r\npeople have been hurried out of life in a few days or hours, because\r\nignorant relatives, nurses and physicians have gathered at their\r\nbedside and implored them to eat. I can look back upon a time in my own\r\nexperience when my wife was in the hospital with a slow fever; they\r\nwould bring her up three square meals a day, consisting of lamb chops,\r\npoached eggs on toast, cooked vegetables, preserves and desserts; and\r\nthe physician would stand by her bedside and say, in sepulchral tones,\r\n\"If you do not eat, you will die!\"\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Arthur Brisbane, wrote me a gravely disapproving letter\r\nwhen he read that I was fasting. I had a long correspondence with him,\r\nat the end of which he acknowledged that there \"might be something in\r\nit.\" \"Even dogs fast when they are ill,\" he wrote; and I replied, \"I\r\nlook forward to the time when human beings may be as wise as dogs.\"\r\nI read the other day an amusing story of a man who made himself a\r\nreputation for curing the diseases of the pampered pets of our rich\r\nsociety ladies. They would bring him their overfed dogs, and he would\r\nshut them up in an old brick-kiln, with a tub of water, and leave them\r\nthere to howl until they were hoarse. In addition to the water he would\r\nput in each cell a hunk of stale bread, a piece of bacon rind, and an\r\nold boot. He would go back at the end of a few days, and if the bread\r\nwas eaten he would write to the fond owner that the dog's recovery was\r\nassured. He would go back in a few more days, and if the bacon rind\r\nwas eaten would write that the dog was nearly well. And at the end of\r\nanother week, he would go back, and if the old boot was eaten he would\r\nwrite to the owner that the dog was now completely restored to health.\r\n\r\nSeveral people wrote me who were in the last stages of some desperate\r\ndisease. Of course they had always been consulting with physicians,\r\nand the physicians had told them that my article was \"pure nonsense\";\r\nand they would write me that they would like to try to fast, but that\r\nthey were \"too weak and too far gone to stand it.\" There is no greater\r\ndelusion than that a person needs strength to fast. The weaker you are\r\nfrom disease, the more certain it is that you need to fast, the more\r\ncertain it is that your body has not strength enough to digest the food\r\nyou are taking into it. If you fast under those circumstances, you will\r\ngrow not weaker, but stronger. In fact, my experience seems to indicate\r\nthat the people who have the least trouble on the fast are the people\r\nwho are most in need of it. The system which has been exhausted by the\r\nefforts to digest the foods that are piled into it, simply lies down\r\nwith a sigh of relief and goes to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe fast is Nature's remedy for all diseases, and there are few\r\nexceptions to the rule. When you feel sick, fast. Do not wait until the\r\nnext day, when you will feel stronger, nor till the next week, when\r\nyou are going away into the country, but stop eating at once. Many of\r\nthe people who wrote to me were victims of our system of wage slavery,\r\nwho wrote me that they were ill, but could not get even a few days'\r\nrelease in which to fast. They wanted to know if they could fast and\r\nat the same time continue their work. Many can do this, especially if\r\nthe work is of a clerical or routine sort. On my first fast I could not\r\nhave done any work, because I was too weak. But on my second fast I\r\ncould have done anything except very severe physical labor. I have one\r\nfriend who fasted eight days for the first time, and who did all her\r\nown housework and put up several gallons of preserves on the last day.\r\nI have received letters from a couple of women who have fasted ten or\r\ntwelve days, and have done all their own work. I know of one case of a\r\nyoung girl who fasted thirty-three days and worked all the time at a\r\nsanatorium, and on the twenty-fourth day she walked twenty miles.\r\n\r\n\r\nFASTING AND THE DOCTORS\r\n\r\nA most discouraging circumstance to me was the attitude of physicians,\r\nas revealed in the correspondence that came to me. Mostly I learned of\r\nthis attitude from the letters of patients who quoted their physicians\r\nto me. From the physicians themselves I heard practically nothing. We\r\nhave some one hundred and forty thousand regularly graduated \"medical\r\nmen\" in this country, and they are all of them presumably anxious to\r\ncure disease. It would seem that an experience such as mine, narrated\r\nover my own signature, and backed by references to other cases, would\r\nhave awakened the interest of a good many of these professional men.\r\n\r\nOut of the six or eight hundred letters that I have received, just two,\r\nso far as I can remember, were from physicians; and out of the hundreds\r\nof newspaper clippings which I received, not a single one was from any\r\nsort of medical journal. There was one physician, in an out-of-the-way\r\ntown in Arkansas, who was really interested, and who asked me to let\r\nhim print several thousand copies of the article in the form of a\r\npamphlet, to be distributed among his patients. One single mind, among\r\nall the hundred and forty thousand, open to a new truth!\r\n\r\nIn the _English Review_ for November, 1910, I find an article entitled\r\n\"Bone-setting and the Profession, by Fairplay.\" It is a narrative of\r\nthe experience of the writer and some of his friends with Osteopathy,\r\nbeing a defence of that method of treatment in cases of bruises and\r\nsprains. I quote the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"Harvey's statement about the circulation of the blood was met with\r\nscorn by the doctors, who called him in derision the 'Circulator.'\r\nSimpson's discovery of the use of chloroform was scouted by them as\r\nincredible, some even declared it to be 'impious,' and a 'defiance of\r\nthe will of God.' Elliotson's use of the stethoscope called forth the\r\nrage of the protected society as a body: the _Lancet_ described him as\r\na 'pariah of the profession.' The ignorant scorn and slander broke his\r\nheart; but to-day the stethoscope is in constant use, and is recognized\r\nas one of the most important aids to a correct diagnosis.\"\r\n\r\nIt might also be of interest to quote the note which one finds appended\r\nto this remarkable article: \"The Editor was amused to find that the\r\n_Lancet_ refused the advertisement of the above article, thereby\r\nconfirming what the writer alleges against the ring.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I realize what a difficult matter it is for a medical man\r\nto face these facts about the fast. Sometimes it seems to me that we\r\nhave no right to expect their help at all, and that we never will\r\nreceive it. For we are asking them to destroy themselves, economically\r\nspeaking. We do not expect aid from eminent corporation lawyers when\r\nwe set out to overthrow the rule of privilege in our country; and it\r\nmust be equally difficult for a hard-worked and not very highly paid\r\nphysician to contemplate the triumph of an idea, which would leave no\r\nplace for him in civilization. In an article contributed to _Physical\r\nCulture_ magazine for January, 1910, I stated that in the course of\r\nmy search for health I had paid to physicians, surgeons, druggists and\r\nsanatoriums not less than fifteen thousand dollars in the last six or\r\neight years. In the last year, since I have learned about the fast,\r\nI have paid nothing at all; and the same thing is true, perhaps on a\r\nsmaller scale, of every one who discovers the fasting cure. As one man,\r\nwho wrote me a letter of enthusiastic gratitude, expresses it: \"I have\r\nspent over five hundred dollars in the last ten years trying to get\r\nwell on medicines. It cost me only thirty cents to use your method, and\r\nfor that thirty cents I obtained relief a million-fold more beneficial\r\nthan from five hundred dollars' worth of medicine.\"\r\n\r\nNot so very long ago I saw a report in some metropolitan newspaper to\r\nthe effect that the medical profession was greatly alarmed over the\r\ndecrease in its revenues--it being estimated that the income of the\r\naverage physician to-day was less than half of what it had been ten\r\nyears ago. All this, I think, is directly attributable to the spread of\r\nknowledge concerning natural methods in the treatment of disease--and,\r\nmore important yet, of natural methods in the preservation of health.\r\nOnly the other day I was talking with a friend who was a teacher in\r\na small college in the Middle West. There was a physician regularly\r\nemployed to attend the girl-students, but several of the teachers\r\nbecame interested in the fasting cure, and whenever they learned of\r\nany illness they would go to the girl and start her on a fast; as a\r\nresult, the physician lost considerably more than half his practice. In\r\nthe same way, I myself recently started several people in a small town\r\nto fasting, and every time I saw the local physician driving by in his\r\ncarriage I marvelled at the courtesy and cordiality he displayed; for\r\nbefore I had left that place I had cured half a dozen of his permanent\r\ncustomers--people to whom he had been dispensing pills and powders\r\nevery few weeks for a dozen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HUMORS OF FASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing these words, it has been just six months since I\r\npublished my first paper upon fasting, and I am still getting letters\r\nabout it at the rate of half a dozen a day. The tent which I inhabit\r\nis rapidly becoming uninhabitable because of pasteboard boxes full of\r\n\"fasting-letters\"; and the store-keeper who is so good as to receive my\r\ntelegrams over the 'phone, is growing quite expert at taking down the\r\nsymptoms of adventurers who get started and want to know how to stop. I\r\ncould make quite a postage-stamp collection from these letters--I had\r\none from Spain and one from India and one from Argentina all in the\r\nsame day. I am sure I might have kept a sanatorium for those people who\r\nhave begged me to let them come and live near me while they were taking\r\na fast. One woman writes to ask me to name my own price to take charge\r\nof a case of elephantiasis which has been given up by all the experts\r\nin Europe!\r\n\r\nAlso, I could fill an article with the \"humors\" of these letters. One\r\nwoman writes a long and anxious inquiry as to whether it is permissible\r\nto drink any _water_ while fasting; and then follows this up with a\r\nspecial delivery letter to say that she hopes I will not think she is\r\ncrazy--she had read the article again and noted the injunction to drink\r\nas much water as she can! And then comes a letter from a man who wants\r\nto know if I really mean it all; do I truly expect him to eat nothing\r\nwhatever--or would I call it fasting if he ate just nuts and fruit now\r\nand then? Quite recently I was talking with a physician--a successful\r\nand well-known physician--who refused point-blank to believe that a\r\nhuman being could live for more than four or five days without any sort\r\nof nutriment. There was no use talking about it--it was a physiological\r\nimpossibility; and even when I offered him the names and addresses of a\r\nhundred people who had done it, he went off unconvinced. And yet that\r\nsame physician professes a religion which through nearly two thousand\r\nyears has recommended \"fasting and prayer\" as the method of the soul's\r\nachievement; and he will go to church and listen reverently to accounts\r\nof a forty-day fast in the wilderness! And he lives in a country in\r\nwhich there are sanatoriums where hundreds of people are fasting all\r\nthe time, and where twenty or thirty-day fasts occasion no more remark\r\nthan a good golf-score at a summer hotel!\r\n\r\nIf you have any doubt that such fasts are taken, you can very quickly\r\nconvince yourself. Less than a year ago I saw a man completing a\r\nfifty-day fast; I talked with him day by day, and I knew absolutely\r\nthat it was all in good faith. The symptoms of fasting are as distinct\r\nand unmistakable as are, for instance, those of smallpox; you could\r\nno more persuade an experienced person that you are fasting when you\r\nare not fasting, than you could persuade a bacteriologist that you had\r\nsleeping-sickness when you were merely lazy.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a very small boy, I recall that a Dr. Tanner took a\r\nforty-day fast in a museum in New York; and I recollect well the\r\nconversation in our family--how obvious it was that the thing must be a\r\nfake, and how foolish people were to be taken in by so absurd a fake.\r\n\"He gets something to eat when nobody's looking,\" we would say.\r\n\r\nBut then what about his weight? Here is a man, going along day by day,\r\nyear in and year out, weighing in the neighborhood of a hundred and\r\nfifty pounds; and now, all of a sudden, he begins to lose a pound a\r\nday, as regularly as the sun rises. How does he do it?\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" we would say, \"he must work hard and get rid of it.\"\r\n\r\nBut how can a man do that, when he had no longer enough muscular tissue\r\nleft to support his weight? And when his pulse is only thirty-five\r\nbeats to the minute?\r\n\r\nThen, says the reader, perhaps he goes to a Turkish bath, and sweats it\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBut ask any jockey how he'd like to take a Turkish bath every day\r\nfor fifty days! And how he would stand it when his arms and thighs\r\nwere so reduced that you could meet your thumb and forefinger around\r\nthem, and could plainly trace the bones and the blood vessels! And\r\nthen again, there is the tongue. If you take a fast and really need\r\nthe fast, you will find your tongue so coated that you can scrape it\r\nwith a knife-blade. And if you break your fast, your tongue will clear\r\nin twenty-four hours; nothing in the world will coat it again but\r\nseveral days more of fasting. How would you propose to get around that\r\ndifficulty?\r\n\r\nSuch ideas have to do with fasting as seen by the outsider. I recollect\r\nreading a diverting account of the fasting cure, in which the victim\r\nwas portrayed as haunted by the ghost of beefsteaks and turkeys. But\r\nthe person who is taking the fast knows nothing of these troubles,\r\nnor would there be much profit in fasting if he did. The fast is not\r\nan ordeal, it is a rest; and I have known people to lose interest in\r\nfood as completely as if they had never tasted any in their lives. I\r\nknow one lady who, to the consternation of her friends and relatives,\r\nbegan a fast three days before Christmas and continued it until three\r\ndays after New Year's; and on both the holidays she cooked a turkey and\r\nserved it for her children. On another occasion, during a week's fast,\r\nshe \"put up\" several gallons of preserves; the only inconvenience being\r\nthat she had to call in a neighbor to taste them and see if they were\r\ndone. I myself took a twelve-day fast while living alone with my little\r\nboy, and three times every day I went into the pantry and set out a\r\nmeal for him. I was not troubled at all by the sight of the food.\r\n\r\nThe longest fast of which I had heard when my article was written\r\nwas seventy-eight days; but that record has since been broken, by a\r\nman named Richard Fausel. Mr. Fausel, who keeps a hotel somewhere in\r\nNorth Dakota, had presumably partaken too generously of the good cheer\r\nintended for his guests, for he found himself at the inconvenient\r\nweight of three hundred and eighty-five pounds. He went to a sanatorium\r\nin Battle Creek and there fasted for forty days (if my recollection\r\nserves me), and by dint of vigorous exercise meanwhile, he got rid of\r\none hundred and thirty pounds. I think I never saw a funnier sight\r\nthan Mr. Fausel at the conclusion of this fast, wearing the same\r\npair of trousers that he had worn at the beginning of it. But the\r\ntemptations of hotel-keeping are severe, and when he went back home,\r\nhe found himself going up in weight again. This time he concluded to\r\ndo the job thoroughly, and went to Macfadden's place in Chicago, and\r\nset out upon a fast of ninety days. That is a new record--though I\r\nsometimes wonder if it is quite fair to call it \"fasting\" when a man is\r\nsimply living upon an internal larder of fat.\r\n\r\nIt must be a curious experience to go for three months without\r\ntasting food. It is no wonder that the stomach and all the organs of\r\nassimilation forget how to do their work. The one danger in the fasting\r\ntreatment is that when you break the fast, hunger is apt to come back\r\nwith a rush, while, on the other hand, the stomach is weak, and the\r\nutmost caution is needed. If you yield to your cravings, you may fill\r\nyour whole system with toxins, and undo all the good of the treatment;\r\nbut if you go slowly, and restrict yourself to very small quantities of\r\nthe most easily assimilated foods, then in an incredibly short time the\r\nbody will have regained its strength.\r\n\r\nMy experience has taught me that it is well not to be too proud at such\r\na time, but to get some one to help you. And it ought to be some one\r\nwho has fasted, for a person at the end of a fast is an agitating sight\r\nto his neighbors, and their one impulse is to get a \"square meal\" into\r\nhim as quickly as possible. Quite recently there was one of my converts\r\ncamping on my trail in New York City, and he called at the home of a\r\nrelative of mine, an elderly lady, who does not take much stock in\r\nmy eccentricities. I shall not soon forget her description of his\r\nappearance--\"I thought he was going to die right there before my eyes!\"\r\nshe said. And no wonder, since the poor fellow had climbed four flights\r\nof stairs to the apartment. \"I know you'll get into trouble,\" added my\r\nrelative, \"if you don't stop advising people to do such things!\"\r\n\r\nI was interested enough in the question of fasting to spend some time\r\nat a sanatorium where they make a specialty of it. One can see a sicker\r\nlooking collection of humans in such a place than anywhere else in the\r\nworld, I fancy. In the first place, people do not take the fasting\r\ncure until they are looking desperate; and when they have got into the\r\nfast they look more desperate. At the later stages they sometimes take\r\nto wheelchairs; and at all times they move with deliberation, and\r\ntheir faces wear serious expressions. They gather in little groups and\r\ndiscuss their symptoms; there is nothing so interesting in the world\r\nwhen you are fasting as to talk symptoms with a lot of people who are\r\ndoing the same thing. There are some who are several days ahead of you,\r\nand who make you ashamed of your doubts; and others who are behind you,\r\nand to whom you have to appear as an old campaigner. So you develop an\r\n_esprit de corps_, as it were--though that sounds as if I were trying\r\nto make a pun.\r\n\r\nAll this may not seem very alluring; but it is far better than a\r\nlife-time of illness, such as many of these people have known before. I\r\nnever knew that there was such terrible suffering in the world until I\r\nheard some of their stories; they would indeed be depressing company,\r\nwere it not for the fact that now they are getting well. The reader may\r\nanswer sarcastically that they _think_ they are. But every Christian\r\nScientist knows that this comes to the same thing; and I have talked\r\nwith not less than a hundred people who have fasted for three days or\r\nmore, and out of these there were but two or three who did not report\r\nthemselves as greatly benefited. So I am accustomed to say that I\r\nwould rather spend my time in a fasting sanatorium than in an ordinary\r\n\"swell\" hotel. The people in the former are making themselves well and\r\nknow it; while the people in the latter are making themselves ill, and\r\ndon't know it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SYMPOSIUM ON FASTING\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently I published a request that those who had tried the fast as the\r\nresult of my advocacy would write to advise me of the results. I stated\r\nthat I desired to hear unfavorable results as well as favorable; that I\r\nwanted to get at the facts, and would tabulate the results exactly as\r\nthey came. The questions asked were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n     1. How many times have you fasted?\r\n\r\n     2. How many days on each occasion?\r\n\r\n     3. From what complaints did you suffer?\r\n\r\n     4. Were these complaints ever diagnosed by regular physician? If\r\n     so, give the names and addresses of these physicians.\r\n\r\n     5. Do you consider that you were definitely benefited by the\r\n     fasts? If so, in what way?\r\n\r\n     6. For how long did the benefit continue?\r\n\r\n     7. Do you consider that you were completely cured?\r\n\r\n     8. Do you consider that you were definitely harmed? If so, in what\r\n     way?\r\n\r\n     9. Have you ever been examined by any regular physician since the\r\n     cure? If so, give name and address.\r\n\r\n     10. Are you willing that your name and address should be quoted\r\n     for the benefit of others?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total number of fasts taken was 277, and the average number of days\r\nwas 6. There were 90 of five days or over, 51 of ten days or over,\r\nand 6 of 30 days or over. Out of the 109 persons who wrote to me, 100\r\nreported benefit, and 17 no benefit. Of these 17 about half give wrong\r\nbreaking of the fast as the reason for the failure. In cases where the\r\ncure had not proved permanent, about half mentioned that the recurrence\r\nof the trouble was caused by wrong eating, and about half of the rest\r\nmade this quite evident by what they said. Also it is to be noted that\r\nin the cases of the 17 who got no benefit, nearly all were fasts of\r\nonly three or four days.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the complete list of diseases benefited--45 of the cases\r\nhaving been diagnosed by physicians: indigestion (usually associated\r\nwith nervousness), 27; rheumatism, 5; colds, 8; tuberculosis, 4;\r\nconstipation, 14; poor circulation, 3; headaches, 5; anæmia, 3;\r\nscrofula, 1; bronchial trouble, 5; syphilis, 1; liver trouble, 5;\r\ngeneral debility, 5; chills and fever, 1; blood poisoning, 1; ulcerated\r\nleg, 1; neurasthenia, 6; locomotor ataxia, 1; sciatica, 1; asthma, 2;\r\nexcess of uric acid, 1; epilepsy, 1; pleurisy, 1; impaction of bowels,\r\n1; eczema, 2; catarrh, 6; appendicitis, 3; valvular disease of heart,\r\n1; insomnia, 1; gas poisoning, 1; grippe, 1; cancer, 1.\r\n\r\nThere follows a brief summary of some of the most interesting cases. A\r\nnumber of longer letters will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Lulu Wallace Smith, 324 W. White Oak Ave., Monrovia, Cal. Age 28.\r\nFasted 30 days for appendicitis and peritonitis, diagnosed by four\r\nphysicians. \"Yes, indeed, I have definitely been benefited by fasting.\r\nMy stomach is not distressed after meals, I have regular evacuations\r\nof the intestines, which I had not had since I was seventeen. I feel\r\nperfectly healthy and look the same.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam N----. Syphilis, with advanced ulcers in throat. Physicians\r\ndeclared the case hopeless. Complete disappearance of symptoms after\r\nfour day's fast, but they gradually reappeared, and longer fast\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nDora Jordan, Connersville, Md. Indigestion, extreme nervousness,\r\nneuralgia in its worst form. Fasted thirty days; did most of cooking\r\nfor a family of five, was at no time tempted to eat. \"I am no longer\r\ntroubled with the old diseases, and weigh more than ever before. After\r\nmy fast I felt as happy and care free as a little child.\"\r\n\r\nC. L. Clark, Greenville, Mich. Nervous, poor digestion. Fasted nine\r\ndays. \"I have been wonderfully benefited, and am a rabid convert.\r\nAlas, for the poor mortal who shows the faintest spark of interest in\r\nmy fast--I hand him the whole works, lock, stock and barrel! I feel\r\na new power and new incentive in life. Whenever I see a sick person,\r\nI feel like telling him that for all he knows to the contrary, good\r\nhealth has been and may be only eight or ten days away and waiting for\r\nyears for him to claim it.\"\r\n\r\nT. S. Jacks, Muskegon, Mich. Twenty days, followed by shorter fasts,\r\nfor stomach trouble, diagnosed by Dr. M---- as cancer. \"He advised\r\nme to be operated on. Since my fast, three years ago, I have had no\r\ntrouble with my stomach. I am entirely cured, and am enjoying fine\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\nGordon G. Ives, 147 Forsythe Bldg., Fresno, Cal. \"Have fasted a good\r\nmany times since 1899, to cure catarrh of stomach, constipation,\r\ndeafness of four months' standing, neuralgia, etc. Duration, from\r\none to sixteen days. Never failed in accomplishing a cure. Benefit\r\ncontinued until I had over-eaten for a long time. Complaints were never\r\ndiagnosed by regular physicians, as I got on to them in 1894.

I fasted nineteen\r\ndays and was completely cured; I received no harm, and have been\r\nexamined since by a physician. I weigh 114 lbs. now and before my fast\r\nweighed 100 lbs. I never felt better in my life than I do at present.\r\nDo not know that I have a pair of lungs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above tabulation of results, it should be\r\nspecified that it does not include any of the cases quoted elsewhere in\r\nthe book; it includes some of the letters given in the Appendix, but\r\nnot all. Thus it will appear that there are many more than 277 cases of\r\nfasting recorded in this volume. The reason that I did not summarize\r\nin the tabulation all the letters I have received is, that I wished to\r\ngive only those which were sent to me in answer to my definite series\r\nof questions, so that I might be sure of getting the unfavorable as\r\nwell as the favorable reports. Recently a well-known physician who\r\nedits a magazine of health came out in vehement opposition to the\r\nfasting cure, maintaining that we hear only of the cases which are\r\nsuccessful, and do not hear of the disastrous failures. In reply to\r\nthis, I wrote to him suggesting that he publish my series of questions\r\nin his magazine, thus giving his readers an opportunity to make me\r\nacquainted with the unsuccessful cases. This, however, the physician\r\ndeclined to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH DURING THE FAST\r\n\r\nThere was much newspaper discussion of my fasting papers--most of\r\nit being sarcastic. The most biting comment that I recall came from\r\nsomewhere out West, and ran about as follows: \"A Seattle man fasted\r\nforty days for stomach trouble. His stomach is troubling him no\r\nlonger. He is dead.\" I set to work to find out about this case, and\r\nI give the facts on page 137. I also saw a report from the London\r\n_Daily Telegraph_ to the effect that a man had died in South Africa\r\nas a result of trying my \"cure.\" How many thousands of people tried\r\nit and lived, I do not know; but horrified relatives and enterprising\r\nnewspaper writers would see that the public was informed about any that\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility or probability of death during a fast, I have one\r\nor two points to note:\r\n\r\nFirst, a good many sick people are dying all the time. It would be an\r\nargument for fasting if it saved any of them. It is no argument against\r\nfasting that it fails to save them all. No one would think of bringing\r\nit up against his surgeon or his family physician that he occasionally\r\nlost a patient.\r\n\r\nSecond, people might die very frequently, without that being an\r\nargument against the cure. It might simply be a consequence of the\r\ndesperately ill class of people who were trying it. A doctor who had a\r\nnew method of healing, and was permitted to use it only upon those whom\r\nall other doctors had given up, would be considered successful if he\r\neffected even an occasional cure. I would wager that of the people who\r\nread my article and set out to fast, practically all had been suffering\r\nfor many years, and had given the \"regular\" physicians unlimited\r\nopportunity to work on them.\r\n\r\nThird, it may be set down as absolutely certain that no one ever died\r\nof starvation while fasting. The essential feature of the fast is that\r\nafter the first two or three days all hunger ceases; and that any one\r\ncould die of lack of food without feeling a desire for food, is absurd\r\nupon the face of it. Nature simply does not work that way. It reminds\r\nme of a young lady who once told me that she would not go to sleep with\r\na mouse in the room, because she imagined the mouse might nibble off\r\nher ear without waking her!\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility that you might starve, during those first days\r\nwhile you _are_ hungry--the answer is simply that you _don't_. It is\r\nperfectly true that men have died of starvation in three or four days;\r\nbut the starvation existed in their minds--it was fright that killed\r\nthem. That they did not truly starve is proven by my letters from\r\nseveral hundreds of people who have fasted over that time, and who are\r\nalive to tell of it.\r\n\r\nThere are conditions in the human body which lead to death inevitably;\r\nand some of these conditions are beyond the power of the fast to\r\nremedy. When a person so afflicted sets out to fast, and dies in spite\r\nof the fast, the papers of course declare that he died because of\r\nthe fast. Dr. L. B. Hazzard of Seattle has published a very useful\r\nlittle book, \"Fasting for the Cure of Disease,\" in which she tells\r\nof two cases of \"death from fasting,\" where the autopsy revealed\r\nconditions with which the fast had no connection, and which made death\r\ncertain. Chances of that sort one has to take in life. You may have\r\na blood vessel in such a state that when you run after a street car\r\nthe increased pressure will cause it to burst; but you do not on that\r\naccount declare that no man ought to exert himself violently.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the part that mental disturbances may play in the\r\nfast, I will cite the case of a woman friend who started out to fast\r\nfor a complication of chronic ailments. She was rather stout, and did\r\nnot mind it at all--was going cheerfully about her daily tasks; but her\r\nhusband heard about it, and came home to tell her what a fool she was\r\nmaking of herself; and in a few hours she was in a state of complete\r\ncollapse. No doubt if there had been a physician in the neighborhood,\r\nthere would have been another tale of a \"victim of a shallow and\r\nunscrupulous sensationalist.\" Fortunately, however, business called\r\nthe husband away again, and the next day the woman was all right,\r\nand completed an eight-day fast with the best results. Bear this in\r\nmind, so that if you wake up some morning and find your temperature\r\nsub-normal and your pulse at forty, and your arms too weak to lift you,\r\nand if your friends get round you and tell you that you look like a\r\nmummy out of a sarcophagus of the seventeenth dynasty, and that I am a\r\nSocialist and an undesirable citizen--you may be able to smile at them\r\ngood naturedly and tell them that you will never again eat until you\r\nare hungry.\r\n\r\nI have thought over the cases of failure of the fast, where I have been\r\nable to inquire into all the circumstances, and I think I can make\r\nthe statement that I do not know a case which might not be attributed\r\neither to the influence of nervous excitement, or to unwise breaking of\r\nthe fast. In the last batch of letters was one with a printed account\r\nof the disastrous results of a three weeks' fast taken by a woman.\r\nIt is an example of about all the blunders that I can think of. She\r\ndescribes herself as occupying \"a responsible office position,\" which\r\ntaxed her strength to the utmost; and she tried to do this work all\r\nthe time she was fasting. She would get up and go to work when she was\r\n\"scarcely able to drag one foot after another.\" On about the nineteenth\r\nday her mother arrived, and then I quote: \"She almost dropped at sight\r\nof me, for I had not given a hint as to my condition; but despite my\r\nprotests, she sent for the doctor at once. My! Didn't he scold, and\r\ntell me what was what! Mother's heart was so torn with sorrow and pity\r\nthat she hadn't the heart to reproach me for my three weeks' orgy of\r\nfasting. She thought I had paid dearly for my folly.\" I don't think\r\nit necessary to say anything more, except that I feel sorry for the\r\nvictim, and that I am glad to know this happened two years ago, so that\r\nI am not to blame for the results.\r\n\r\nBy way of contrast with this case I will quote the following letter,\r\nwhich will show the reader the kind of experience that makes fasting\r\nenthusiasts: \"My wife and I have each nearly reached our seventy-second\r\nyear. I was born a physical wreck. A dozen years ago we began taking\r\nshort fasts, from three to eleven days' duration, for all our ills\r\nof the flesh. But each of us had chronic troubles of forty years'\r\nstanding, which seemed growing no better. And finally, two years ago\r\nlast July, my wife said she was going to take a 'conquest fast' if\r\nit killed her, for she was tired of living with her present ills. I\r\nthought it a good time to try a little conquest fasting on my own hook.\r\nI had no fear of the result. I knew that nature would tell me when I\r\nhad fasted long enough. So we began an absolute fast from all food\r\nexcept distilled water and fresh air. We lived in fresh air night and\r\nday. We took copious enemas daily, and I took a cabinet sweat, followed\r\nby a cold plunge every other day. I knew that I must have many years of\r\nfilth accumulation in my bowels. And the amount of putridity that came\r\nfrom my bowels the first twenty-five days of the fast was amazing.\r\n\r\n\"After fasting twenty-eight days I began to be hungry, and broke my\r\nfast with a little grape juice, followed the next day with tomatoes,\r\nand later with vegetable soup. My wife began to be hungry after fasting\r\nthirty-one days, and broke her fast in a similar manner to myself.\r\n\r\n\"It is now two years since we took the conquest fast, and my wife has\r\nno return of her former troubles. And I am enjoying all the mental\r\nand physical pleasures which come from clean bowels. We think we\r\nhave learned how to live that we will never need another fast. Soon\r\nafter the fast I was examined by Dr. S----, the leading surgeon of\r\nLos Angeles and Southern California, who pronounced me as being the\r\nmost wonderful person he ever met regarding softness of arteries, and\r\nsuppleness of body, for my age.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFASTING AND THE MIND\r\n\r\nThe reader will observe that I discuss this fasting question from a\r\nmaterialistic view-point. I am telling what it does to the body; but\r\nbesides this, of course, fasting is a religious exercise. I heard\r\nthe other day from a man who was taking a forty-day fast, as a means\r\nof increasing his \"spiritual power.\" I am not saying that for you\r\nto smile at--he has excellent authority for the procedure. The point\r\nwith me is that I find life so full of interest just now that I don't\r\nhave much time to think about my \"soul.\" I get so much pleasure out\r\nof a handful of raisins, or a cold bath, or a game of tennis, that I\r\nfear it is interfering with my spiritual development. I have, however,\r\na very dear friend who goes in for the things of the soul, and she\r\ntells me that when you are fasting, the higher faculties are in a\r\nsensitive condition, and that you can do many interesting things with\r\nyour subliminal self. For instance, she had always considered herself\r\na glutton; and so, during an eight-day fast, just before going to\r\nsleep and just after awakening, she would lie in a sort of trance and\r\nimpress upon her mind the idea of restraint in eating. The result, she\r\ndeclared, has been that she has never since then had an impulse to\r\nover-eat.\r\n\r\nThere are many such curious things, about which you may read in the\r\nbooks of the yogis and the theosophists--who were fasting in previous\r\nincarnations when you and I were swinging about in the tree-tops by\r\nour tails. But I ought to report upon one fasting experiment which\r\nresulted disastrously for me. Earlier in this book I told how I had\r\nbeen able to write the greater part of a play while fasting. Shortly\r\nafterwards I plunged into the writing of a new novel, and as usual I\r\ngot so much interested in it that I wasn't hungry. I said that I would\r\nfast, and save the eating time, and the digesting time as well. So I\r\nwould sit and work for sixteen hours or more a day, sometimes for six\r\nhours at a stretch without moving. After two or three days of this I\r\nwould be hungry, and would eat something; but being too much excited\r\nto digest it, I would say, \"Hang eating, anyhow!\"--and go on for\r\nanother period of work. I kept that up for some six weeks, and I turned\r\nout an appalling lot of manuscript; but I found that I had taken off\r\ntwenty-five pounds of flesh, and had got to such a point that I could\r\nnot digest a little warm milk. I cite this in order that the reader may\r\nunderstand just why I take a gross and material view of fasting. My\r\nadvice is to lie round in the sun and read story-books and take care of\r\nyour body, and leave the soul-exercises and the nervous efforts until\r\nthe fast is over. But all the same, I know that there will be great\r\npoetry written some day, when our poets have got on to the fasting\r\ntrick--and when our poets care enough about their work to be willing to\r\nfeed it with their own flesh.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about the fast is that it sets you a new standard of\r\nhealth. You have been accustomed to worrying along somehow; but now you\r\ndiscover your own possibilities, and thereafter you are not content\r\nuntil you have found some way to keep that virginal state of stomach\r\nwhich one possesses for a month or two after a successful fast. It\r\nmust mean, of course, many changes in your life, if you really wish\r\nto keep it. It means the giving up of tobacco and alcohol, and a too\r\nsedentary life, and steam-heated rooms; above all else, it means giving\r\nup self-indulgent eating.\r\n\r\nA couple of years ago my wife and myself made the acquaintance of\r\na young lady patient in a sanatorium, who was in a much run-down\r\ncondition, anæmic and nervous. We persuaded her to take a fast of\r\nfive or six days, and afterwards take the milk diet, as the result of\r\nwhich she went back to her home in Virginia with what she described\r\nas \"smiles and dimples and curves and bright eyes.\" She was so\r\nenthusiastic about the cure that she proceeded to apply it to all her\r\nfamily and her friends; and some time afterwards she wrote my wife\r\na most diverting account of her adventures. After some persuasion I\r\nsecured her permission to quote her letter, having duly omitted all the\r\nnames. It makes clear the thorny path which the fasting enthusiast has\r\nto travel in this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I will try in a very limited space of time to tell you what\r\n     keeps me a slave here at home. I got Mr. X---- down from ----\r\n     to put papa and mamma on the fasting cure--papa had a bad case\r\n     of grippe--mamma had indigestion. My oldest married brother is\r\n     in dreadful health, and his wife and baby are not well. I wore\r\n     myself nearly out trying to get them well, and at the same time\r\n     trying to pick up some threads of long neglected social duties.\r\n     People were beginning to call me \"stuck-up\" (horrid vulgar term),\r\n     so unless I wanted to make enemies of the wives and daughters\r\n     of papa's and brother's business friends, I had to go to a few\r\n     parties and pay some long-neglected calls. I did it all, and then\r\n     decided to have Mr. X---- come to help me. I got papa and mamma\r\n     and M---- and _her baby_(!) on a fast--and then woe is me--I had\r\n     to get them off again! They had various and alarming symptoms due\r\n     to their ignorance of the methods, and the wild interest of the\r\n     town medicine-men. The family doctor gave me a \"straight talk\" and\r\n     asked me if I was going to try _to kill my father and mother_.\r\n     Papa would not give up his cigarettes, and a \"toddy\" now and then.\r\n     M----'s baby lost four pounds while his mother was fasting. All\r\n     the doctors' wives came to call, and beset me with questions--and\r\n     I had the d---- of a time. But I stood by my guns. When the\r\n     overfed, self-indulgent family all got to vomiting at once, my\r\n     hands were full, and I nearly had nervous prostration before I got\r\n     order out of the bedlam I had stirred up.\r\n\r\n     Well, they got over the fast and on to the milk. Then I had to\r\n     tend to the milk myself or they refused to drink it. Finally mamma\r\n     got to feeling so well that she sat up, and planned big course\r\n     dinners and invited people to eat them. She began to order new\r\n     clothes for the kids, new furnishings for the house, and started\r\n     in to live her disorderly, ungodly \"Southern hospitality\" life all\r\n     over again. Our senator died and mamma got into politics in the\r\n     new election; and Cousin J---- got drunk, and I had to go with him\r\n     to the Keeley Institute, etc., etc. Surely there is a heaven for\r\n     saints like me. I did not fly the roost as I was tempted to do,\r\n     but I answered midnight calls of the spoiled, nauseated ones, and\r\n     fixed hot-water bags, quelled riots among the meat-eating servants\r\n     and hungry children--and swore I'd win! I did. Well, I got things\r\n     going in fine order at last, with papa cured of his grippe and an\r\n     old case of kidney trouble. Mamma is now comfortably eating boiled\r\n     ham and stuffed peppers, and fruit cake and cherry pie, and green\r\n     olives and what not at the same meal. She is well, though. But\r\n     of course she will get sick again. Papa, the only sane member of\r\n     our family, is still holding on to the milk, taking four quarts\r\n     of buttermilk a day, and he is flourishing, thank heaven! M----\r\n     is still bilious, having broken her fast with hard-boiled eggs\r\n     and pork chops. And I am still living, in spite of having been to\r\n     Keeley, and incidentally having danced all night (with a low-neck,\r\n     short-sleeved gown on!) at the ---- Club ball, sat through several\r\n     dinners and bridge parties into the \"wee sma' hours,\" and had\r\n     two men propose to me with the prelude, \"You are the nicest,\r\n     most refined, and most lovable girl in the world if you _are_ a\r\n     crank.\" Wasn't that a nice beginning for a proposal of marriage?\r\n     I accepted them both on condition that I be allowed to remain a\r\n     crank.\r\n\r\n     Well, the next chapter began with an old lover who had married\r\n     another woman. He came to see me and said he had a tape-worm! Ye\r\n     gods--such romance! His wife had stomach and intestinal trouble.\r\n     I turned Mr. X---- over to them, and them over to Mr. X----. The\r\n     lady got along, but the poor man with a wild beast inside him\r\n     got so sick after an eight-day fast that he wanted to have me\r\n     mobbed, sent for two trained nurses and four doctors--this is no\r\n     exaggeration--the doctors looked at me, and looks were as plain as\r\n     words--\"You little devil! You did it for pure meanness.\" For three\r\n     days my poor friend had the doctors giving him hypodermics, and\r\n     he never stopped vomiting until we were all nearly dead. Then he\r\n     quieted down, got well, ate a beef-steak with a few dozen oysters\r\n     and mushrooms, and took me riding in his new automobile. The grim\r\n     humor in the whole thing is that if I had not gotten my roses and\r\n     dimples and curves and bright eyes back by fasting, this man would\r\n     never have taken me riding in his new automobile. Take a tip from\r\n     me--all the good nursing and friendly efforts in behalf of the\r\n     health of my friends did not endear me to them one half as much\r\n     as the plump, rosy smile I wore with my new silk gown. The first\r\n     day our sick friend went out in his car--alas for the ways of\r\n     human nature--masculine human nature, I mean--I told him so. And\r\n     he agreed with me and ended by saying, \"Darn an ugly woman--I'll\r\n     forgive a pretty one _anything_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDIET AFTER THE FAST\r\n\r\nMany people write me, begging me to outline for them the ideal diet.\r\nI used to do that sort of thing, but I have stopped; having come to\r\nrealize that we are still at the beginning of our diet-experiments.\r\nI have done a good deal of experimenting myself, and have made some\r\ninteresting discoveries. I have lived for a week on fruit only, and\r\nagain on wheat only; I have lived for three weeks on nothing but\r\nmilk, and again on nothing but beef-steak. I have lived for a year\r\non raw food, and for over three years I professed the religion of\r\nvegetarianism. For the last two months I have lived on beef-steak,\r\nshredded wheat, raisins and fresh fruit; but by the time this book\r\nappears I may be trying sour milk and dates--somebody told me about\r\nthat the other day, and it sounds good to me. Some of my correspondents\r\nobject to my willingness to try new diets; they write me that they find\r\nit bewildering, and think it indicative of an unstable mind. They do\r\nnot realize that I am exacting in my demands--I want a diet which will\r\npermit me to overwork with impunity. I haven't found it yet, but I am\r\non the way; and meantime I make my experiments with a light heart, for\r\nI always know that if anything goes wrong, I can take a fast and start\r\nafresh.\r\n\r\nThe general rules are mostly of a negative sort. There are many kinds\r\nof foods, some of them most generally favored, of which one may say\r\nthat they should never be used, and that those who use them can never\r\nbe as well as they would be without them. Such foods are all that\r\ncontain alcohol or vinegar; all that contain cane sugar; all that\r\ncontain white flour in any one of its thousand alluring forms of\r\nbread, crackers, pie, cake, and puddings; and all foods that have been\r\nfried--by which I mean cooked with grease, whether that grease be lard,\r\nor butter, or eggs or milk. It is my conviction that one should bar\r\nthese things at the outset, and admit of no exceptions. I do not mean\r\nto say that healthy men and women cannot eat such things and be well;\r\nbut I say that they cannot be as well as they would be without them;\r\nand that every particle of such food they eat renders them more liable\r\nto all sorts of infection, and sows in their systems the seeds of the\r\nparticular chronic disease that is to lay them low sooner or later.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of other things, which I do not rate as quite so\r\nbad, but which we bar in our family--simply because they are not\r\nso good. For instance, I am inclined to regard beans as being too\r\ndifficult of digestion and too liable to fermentation to be eaten\r\nby any one who can get anything better. And I personally do not\r\neat peanuts, because I have found that I do not digest them; and I\r\ndo not use milk (except in the exclusive milk diet), because it is\r\nconstipating, and I have a tendency in that direction. Almost everyone\r\nwill discover idiosyncrasies of that sort in his own system. One person\r\ncannot digest cheese, another cannot digest bananas, another cannot\r\nstand the taste of olive oil. You may read a glowing account of some\r\ndiet system by which some other person has worked miracles, and you may\r\ntry it, and persist in it for a long time, and finally come to realize\r\nthat it was the worst diet you could possibly have been following. I\r\nhave always counted orange juice as the ideal food with which to break\r\na fast; yet a friend whom I was advising broke his fast with the juice\r\nof half an orange, and had a violent cramp. He had been so confiding in\r\nmy greater knowledge that he had omitted to tell me that any sort of\r\nacid fruit had always made him ill.\r\n\r\nSuch things as this are of course not natural; but a perfectly normal\r\nand well person is, under the artificial conditions of our bringing up,\r\na very great rarity; and so we all have to regard ourselves as more or\r\nless diseased, and work towards the ideal of soundness. We must do this\r\nwith intelligence--there is no short cut, no way to save one's self the\r\ntrouble of thinking.\r\n\r\nI used to think there was. I would discover this or that wonderful new\r\ndiet-wrinkle, and I would go round preaching it to all my friends, and\r\nmaking a general nuisance of myself. And some one would try it, and it\r\nwould not work; and often, to my own humiliation, I would discover that\r\nit was not working in my own case half so well as I had thought it was.\r\n\r\nBy way of setting an ideal, let me give you the example of a young lady\r\nwho for six or seven months has been living in our home, and giving\r\nus a chance to observe her dietetic habits. This young lady three\r\nyears ago was an anæmic school-teacher, threatened with consumption,\r\nand a victim of continual colds and headaches; miserable and beaten,\r\nwith an exopthalmic goitre which was slowly choking her to death. She\r\nfasted eight days, and achieved a perfect cure. She is to-day bright,\r\nalert and athletic; and she lives on about twelve hundred calories\r\nof food a day--one half what I eat, and less than a third of the\r\nold-school dietetic standards. Occasionally she will eat nut butter,\r\nor sweet potato, or some whole wheat crackers with butter, or a dish of\r\nice-cream; but at least ninety per cent of her food has consisted of\r\nfresh fruit. Meal after meal, day after day, I have seen her eat one\r\nor two bananas and two or three peaches, or say, a slice of watermelon\r\nor canteloupe; at some meals she will eat only the peaches, and then\r\nagain she will eat nothing. A dollar a week would pay for all her food;\r\nand on this diet she laughs and talks, reads and thinks, walks and\r\nswims with my wife and myself--a kind of external dietetic conscience,\r\nwhich we would find it hard to get along without. And tell me, Dr.\r\nWoods Hutchinson, or other scoffer at the \"food-faddists,\" don't you\r\nthink that a case like this gives us some right to ask for patient\r\ninvestigation of our claims? Or will you stand by your pill boxes and\r\nyour carving-knives and the rest of your paraphernalia, and compel us\r\nto cure all your patients in spite of you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF MEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nI am asked many questions as to my attitude toward the question of\r\nmeat-eating. I was brought up on a diet of meat, bread and butter,\r\npotatoes, and sweet things. Four years ago when I found myself\r\ndesperately run down, suffering from nervousness, insomnia, and\r\nalmost incessant headaches, I came upon various articles written by\r\nvegetarians, and I began to suspect that my trouble might be due to\r\nmeat. I went away on a camping-trip for several weeks, taking no meat\r\nwith me, and because I found that I was a great deal better, I believed\r\nthat the meat had been responsible for my trouble. I then visited the\r\nBattle Creek Sanitarium, and became familiar with all their arguments\r\nagainst meat, and thereafter I did not use it for three years. I called\r\nmyself a vegetarian; but at the same time I realized that I differed\r\nfrom most vegetarians in some important particulars.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I had never taken any stock in the arguments for\r\nvegetarianism upon the moral side. It has always seemed to me that\r\nhuman beings have a right to eat meat, if meat is necessary for their\r\nbest development, either physical or mental. I have never had any\r\nsympathy with that \"humanitarianism\" which tells us that it is our duty\r\nto regard pigs and chickens as our brothers. I was listening the other\r\nday to one of these enthusiasts, who had been reading aloud one of the\r\n\"Uncle Remus\" stories, and who went on in touching language to set\r\nforth the fact that his vegetable garden constituted one place where\r\n\"Bre'r Rabbit\" was free to wander at will and to help himself; and he\r\ndescribed how happy it made him to see these gentle animals hopping\r\nabout among his cabbages, having lost all their fear of him. That sort\r\nof thing will work very well so long as it is confined to one farm,\r\nand so long as there is a hunting season upon all the other farms in\r\nthe locality; but let the humanitarians proceed to apply their regimen\r\nin a whole state, and they will soon have so many billions of rabbits\r\nhopping about among their cabbages that they will have to choose\r\nbetween shooting rabbits or having no cabbages.\r\n\r\nThe reader, I presume, is familiar with calculations which show\r\nthe rate at which rabbits multiply, how many tens and hundreds of\r\nmillions would be produced by a single pair of rabbits in ten years.\r\nIt should be quite obvious that the time would come when all human\r\nbeings would be spending their energies in planting gardens to support\r\nrabbits; and that if ever they stopped planting gardens, there would\r\nbe a famine for the rabbits, with infinitely more suffering than is\r\ninvolved in the present method of keeping them down. Also, even though\r\nthe humanitarians might have their way with men, the hawks and the\r\nowls and the foxes would probably remain unregenerate. I remember,\r\nwhen I was a small boy, being sternly rebuked by an agitated maiden\r\nlady who discovered me throwing stones at a squirrel. Not so many\r\ndays afterwards, however, the lady discovered the squirrel engaged in\r\ncarrying off young birds from a nest outside her window, and she found\r\nher theories about \"kindness to dumb animals\" rudely disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe same thing, it seems to me, is still more true of domestic animals.\r\nDomestic animals survive on earth solely because of the protection\r\nof man, and for the sake of the benefits they bring to him. If it is\r\nnecessary to human health and well-being to slaughter a cow rather than\r\nto wait and let her die of old age and lingering disease, it seems to\r\nme that nothing but mawkish sentimentality would protest.\r\n\r\nIt is pointed out to us what places of cruelty and filth our\r\nslaughter-houses are; the reader may believe that I learned something\r\nabout this in my preparations for the writing of \"The Jungle.\" But\r\nthen this is not necessarily true about slaughter-houses--any more\r\nthan it is necessarily true that railroads must kill and maim a couple\r\nof hundred thousand people in this country every year. In Europe they\r\nhave municipal slaughter-houses which are constructed upon scientific\r\nlines, and in which no filth is permitted to accumulate; also they\r\nhave devised means for the killing of animals which are painless. In\r\nthe stockyards I have seen a man standing upon a gallery, leaning over\r\nand pounding at the head of a steer with a hammer, and making half a\r\ndozen blows before he succeeded in knocking down the terrified animal.\r\nIn Europe, on the other hand, they fit over the head of the animal a\r\nleathern cap, which has in it a steel spike; a single tap upon the\r\nhead of this spike is sufficient to drive it into the animal's brain,\r\ncausing instant insensibility.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be borne in mind also that the sufferings of dumb animals\r\nare entirely different from our own. They do not suffer the pains of\r\nanticipation. A cow walks into a slaughter-house without fear, and\r\nstands still and permits a leathern cap to be fitted over its head\r\nwithout suspicion; and while it is placidly grazing in the field, it\r\nis untroubled by any consciousness of the fact that next week it will\r\nbe hanging in a butcher's shop as beef. I recall in this connection\r\nan observation of that wise philosopher, Mr. Dooley, concerning the\r\ninhumanities of vegetarianism. He said that it had always seemed to\r\nhim a very cruel thing \"to cut off a young tomato in its prime, or to\r\nmurder a whole cradle full of baby peas in the pod.\"\r\n\r\nThese things will convince the devotee of the religion of vegetarianism\r\nthat I am a lost soul, and always have been. Perhaps so. I try to\r\nguide my conduct by scientific knowledge; what I ask to know about the\r\nquestion of meat-eating is the actual facts of its effect upon the\r\nhuman organism--the amount of energy which it develops, the diseases\r\nwhich it causes, or, on the contrary, the immunity to disease which it\r\nclaims to confer; also, of course, its cheapness and convenience as\r\nan article of diet. Some evidence of this sort we possess; but very\r\nlittle, it seems to me, in proportion to the importance of the subject.\r\nProfessor Fisher has conducted some thorough experiments as to the\r\ninfluence of meat-eating upon endurance, which seem to develop the\r\nfact that vegetarians possess a far greater amount of endurance than\r\nmeat-eaters. These experiments are what we want, but they seemed to me,\r\nwhen I read them, to be weak in one or two important particulars. They\r\ndid not tell us what the vegetarians ate, nor what the meat-eaters ate.\r\nThose who are vegetarians at the present day are very apt to be people\r\nwho have given some thought to the question of diet, and have attempted\r\nto adopt sounder ways of life; while, on the other hand, meat-eaters\r\nare generally people who have given no thought to the question of\r\nhealth at all--they are very apt to be smokers and drinkers as well as\r\nmeat-eaters. Also it is to be pointed out that endurance is not the\r\nonly factor of importance to our physical well-being.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous expositions of the greater liability of meat\r\nto contamination. Dr. Kellogg, for instance, has purchased specimens\r\nof meat in the butcher-shops, and has had them examined under the\r\nmicroscope, and has told us how many hundreds of millions of bacteria\r\nto the gram have been discovered. This argument has a tendency to appal\r\none; I know it had great effect upon me for a long time, and I took\r\nelaborate pains to take into my system only those kinds of food which\r\nwere sterilized, or practically so. This is the health regimen which\r\nis advocated by Professor Metchnikoff; one should eat only foods which\r\nhave been thoroughly boiled and sterilized. I have come, in the course\r\nof time, to the conclusion that this way of living is suicidal, and\r\nthat there is no way of destroying one's health more quickly. I think\r\nthat the important question is, not how many bacteria there are in the\r\nfood when you swallow it, but how many bacteria there come to be in\r\nfood after it gets into your alimentary canal. The digestive juices\r\nare apparently able to take care of a very great number of germs;\r\nit is after the food has passed on down, and is lodged in the large\r\nintestine, that the real fermentation and putrefaction begin--and these\r\ncount for more, in the question of health, than that which goes on in\r\nthe butcher-shop or the refrigerator or the pantry.\r\n\r\nDo not misunderstand what I mean by this. I am not advocating that\r\nanyone should swallow the bacteria of deadly diseases, such as typhoid\r\nand cholera; I am not advocating that anyone should use food which\r\nis in a state of decomposition--on the contrary, I have ruled out of\r\nmy dietary a number of foods in common use which depend for their\r\nproduction upon bacterial action; for instance, beer and wine, and\r\nall alcoholic drinks, all kinds of cheeses, sauerkraut, vinegar, etc.\r\nMy point is simply that the ordinary healthy person has no reason for\r\nterrifying himself about the common aërobic bacteria--which swarm\r\nin the atmosphere, and are found by hundreds of millions in all raw\r\nfood, and in cooked food which has not been kept with the elaborate\r\nprecautions that a surgeon uses with his instruments and linen; also\r\nthat the real problem is to take into the system those foods which can\r\nbe readily digested and assimilated, and which afford the body all the\r\nelements that it needs to keep itself in the best condition for the\r\ninevitable, incessant warfare with the hostile organisms which surround\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSo far as meat is concerned, of course no sensible person would use\r\nmeat which showed the slightest trace of being spoiled, nor any meat\r\nwhich had been canned, or ground up and made into messes, such as\r\nsausage. If one uses reasonably fresh meat, the bacteria which may\r\nbe on the outside of it will be killed by proper cooking. And so the\r\nquestion is, it seems to me, what does meat do after it gets into the\r\nstomach? And that is a matter for practical experiment, which very few\r\npeople have made, so far as I have any information. Innumerable people\r\nare eating meat, of course; but they are eating it in combination with\r\nall other kinds of destructive foods, and they are eating it prepared\r\nin innumerable unwholesome ways. So far as I know, no scientist has\r\never taken a group of normal men and kept them for a certain period\r\nupon a rational vegetarian diet, and then put them for another period\r\nupon a diet containing broiled fresh meat, and made a thoroughly\r\nscientific study of their condition, as, for instance, Professor\r\nChittenden did for his \"low proteid\" experiments.\r\n\r\nFor about a year previous to reading about Dr. Salisbury's \"meat diet,\"\r\nI had been following the raw-food regimen. I had gained wonderful\r\nresults from this, and I had written a good deal about it; but I had\r\ngot these results while leading an active life, and not doing hard\r\nbrain-work. I found continually that when I settled down to a sedentary\r\nlife, and to writing which involved a great nervous strain, I began to\r\nlose weight on raw food; and if I kept on with this regimen, I would\r\nbegin to have headaches, and other signs of distress from what I was\r\neating. As an illustration of what I mean, I might say that quite\r\nrecently I plunged into a novel in which I was very much absorbed, and\r\nI lost twelve pounds in sixteen days; and this, it must be understood,\r\nwithout changing my diet in the slightest particular. I went on with\r\nthe work for about six weeks, and by that time I had lost twenty\r\npounds. In explaining this to myself, I was divided between uncertainty\r\nas to whether I was working too hard, or whether I was eating too much.\r\nFinally I took the precaution to weigh what I was eating, and to make\r\nquite certain that I was eating no more than I had been accustomed\r\nto eat during periods when I had remained at my normal weight. I then\r\ncut the quantity of my food in half, and found that I lost much less\r\nrapidly. This served to convince me that the trouble lay in the fact\r\nthat I had not sufficient nervous energy left to assimilate the food\r\nthat I was taking.\r\n\r\nAnd I have known others to have this same experience. Bernarr\r\nMacfadden, in particular, told me that he could not get along upon\r\nthe nut and fruit diet while closely confined in his office, and that\r\nhe found the solution of his problem in milk. Inasmuch as there is\r\nnothing that poisons me quite so quickly as milk, I had to look farther\r\nfor my solution. As a matter of fact, I had been looking for this\r\nsolution for more than ten years, though it is only quite recently that\r\nI had come to understand the problem clearly. It is a problem which\r\nevery brain-worker faces; and I am sure, therefore, that there will\r\nbe many who will find the report of my experiments and blunders to\r\nbe of interest to them. I have tried, under these circumstances, all\r\nkinds of the more digestible foods--toast, rice, baked potatoes, baked\r\napples, milk, poached eggs, and so on; always I have found that these\r\nfoods digested perfectly, but they poisoned my system because of their\r\nconstipating effect; and this was a dilemma which I was never able to\r\nget around.\r\n\r\nI now read Dr. Salisbury's book, \"The Relation of Alimentation to\r\nDisease.\" Many of his experiments I found extremely interesting. Dr.\r\nSalisbury described the consequences of the ordinary starch and sugar\r\ndiet as making a \"yeast-pot\" of one's intestinal tract. I found in my\r\nown case many of the symptoms which he described, and I determined to\r\nsee what would be the effect of the meat diet in my case.\r\n\r\nI began the experiment with reluctance. I had lost all interest in the\r\ntaste of meat, and I had a prejudice against it; I hated the smell of\r\nit, and I hated the feeling of it, and I was prepared for the direst\r\nconsequences, according to the prophecies of my vegetarian friends. I\r\nshould not have been at all surprised if I had been made very ill by\r\nmy first meal. I was prepared to allow for that, supposing that after\r\nthree years I had perhaps forgotten how to digest meat. To my surprise,\r\nhowever, I found no difficulty at all. I soon gave up preparing the\r\nmeat according to the elaborate prescription of Dr. Salisbury, and\r\ncontented myself simply with eating good lean beef-steak. I continued\r\nthe experiment for two weeks, living upon meat exclusively. I found\r\nthat all my symptoms of stomach trouble disappeared, and I had no\r\nheadaches whatever. I got quite weak upon the exclusive diet, but this\r\nwas according to Dr. Salisbury's statement; just as soon as I added a\r\nlittle shredded wheat biscuit and dried fruit to the menu this trouble\r\ndisappeared, and I gained in weight with great rapidity, and was soon\r\nback where I had been before.\r\n\r\nI did not continue the diet, owing partly to distaste for it, and\r\npartly to the inconvenience of it. I had accustomed myself to the\r\nraw food way of living, and any one who knows what this means can\r\nunderstand my distaste for washing plates and scraping frying-pans, and\r\ngoing to the bother of getting fresh meat and keeping it and cooking\r\nit. Also, of course, there was the item of expense. Upon the raw-food\r\ndiet I had been able to live for ten cents a day. I am never accustomed\r\nto spending more than thirty or forty cents a day, even when indulging\r\nin abundant fresh fruit.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I ought also to specify that a good deal of the success of the\r\ndiet may have been owing to the hot-water regimen which is a part of\r\nit. An hour or two before every meal one is supposed to sip at least\r\na pint of very hot water, which has the effect of cleansing out the\r\nstomach, and stimulates peristaltic action to a remarkable degree. I\r\nhad been accustomed to drink hot water while fasting, but I had never\r\ntaken it systematically, as I did at this time. It is a trick well\r\nworth knowing about.\r\n\r\nI ought also to mention the fact that I suggested to several others\r\nthat they try this meat diet. One of them, a friend who had been\r\neating raw food at my suggestion, with the very best results, began\r\nthe experiment and continued for three days, and the results were\r\nmost disappointing. This friend, a woman in middle years, became very\r\nill, with all the symptoms of stomach trouble, diarrhoea, and general\r\npoisoning. She wrote me that she gave up the diet at the end of three\r\ndays, because she saw no use in making herself desperately ill. She\r\nadded: \"I followed the regimen in every smallest detail, precisely\r\naccording to Dr. Salisbury's direction. You know me, and you know that\r\nwhen I do a thing I do it thoroughly, so there is no need to say any\r\nmore about that.\" Which only goes to show that, as the proverb has it,\r\n\"One man's meat is another man's poison.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Salisbury recommends the meat diet especially in cases of\r\ntuberculosis. He finds that the predisposing cause of this disease\r\nis \"vegetable fermentation.\" He declares that the excessive starch\r\nand sugar diet leads to the production of yeast spores and other\r\nferments in the intestinal tract, and that these are absorbed into\r\nthe circulation and ultimately clog the small capillaries in the\r\nlungs. Dr. Salisbury's theory was set forth over thirty years ago, and\r\nthat was before Koch had made his discovery of the tubercle bacillus.\r\nThis discovery would seem to put Dr. Salisbury's theory out of court\r\naltogether; but as we physical culturists are inclined to suspect,\r\nthere are causes of disease lying behind the attack of the specific\r\nbacillus. These causes are a depleted blood supply and a weakened\r\nsystem; and it seems to me, from what I have observed of consumptives\r\nand their diet, that Dr. Salisbury's theories fit in very well indeed\r\nwith the Koch theory.\r\n\r\nI wrote recently to Professor Chittenden to ask him what, in his\r\nopinion, would be the effects of the meat diet upon tuberculosis.\r\nHe replied that he knew no reason for believing that it would be of\r\nspecial benefit but that the whole subject of diet in tuberculosis\r\nseemed to him to be one concerning which there was urgent need of\r\nexperiment and investigation. This is unquestionably the case. I know\r\nno two physicians who seem to agree in the diets they prescribe to\r\nconsumptives, and I have never met two consumptives who followed the\r\nsame regimen. The general idea seems to be to stuff as much food in\r\nyour system as you possibly can, especially milk and raw eggs; and it\r\nseems to me quite certain that, whatever system may be correct, this\r\nsystem is incorrect.\r\n\r\nThis much seems to me to be clear: tuberculosis is a disease brought\r\nabout by under-nourishment. It is a disease to which the poor are\r\nespecially liable; and while this is undoubtedly in part due to bad\r\nair, it is also due to bad feeding. And when ignorant people wish to\r\nlive cheaply, the foods they eat are the sugar and starch foods. I\r\nremember in Thoreau's \"Walden\" he sets forth how he lived for many\r\nmonths upon five or six dollars' worth of food. He does not give the\r\namount of the food by weight, so of course we cannot tell exactly; but\r\nhe gives the prices he paid, and the leading articles in his diet were\r\nflour, rice, corn-meal, molasses, sugar and lard. One is, therefore,\r\nperfectly prepared to learn that Thoreau died of consumption. And\r\nthe same thing, I believe, will happen to a good many enthusiastic\r\nvegetarians of my acquaintance. They have given up meat, and they have\r\nmade up for it by increasing their consumption of bread and crackers,\r\nrice and potatoes, and prepared and predigested cereals, which they eat\r\nwith cream and sugar. Even when they use high proteid food, it is in\r\nsome form such as beans, which contain a great deal of starch, and in\r\na form which is difficult of digestion. As a result of this, they are\r\nthin and anæmic looking--they do not seem to be able to put on flesh by\r\nmeans of intellectual fervor and an optimistic philosophy. The result\r\nof my meat-diet experiment has been to convince me yet more firmly\r\nthat the cooked-vegetable diet is the worst diet in the world for\r\nmyself. (I am content to phrase it that way, and leave it for others\r\nto find out about their own case.) There has been some agitation in\r\nvegetarian circles since the report has gone around that I have become\r\na backslider, and have gone back to the flesh-pots. I state the facts\r\nhere for what they may be worth to others. I shall never call myself a\r\n\"vegetarian\" again--though I shall be a vegetarian the greater part of\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nFor it should be noted, of course, that the objections which I have\r\nbrought against the cooked vegetarian diet do not apply at all to the\r\nraw-food diet, which is entirely a different matter. If one lives upon\r\nnuts, whole grains boiled or shredded, salad vegetables and fruits,\r\nhe does not get an excess of either starch or sugar, but a perfectly\r\nbalanced dietary, every article of which is rich in natural salts--in\r\nwhich the starchy foods, and especially the prepared cereals, are\r\nfatally deficient. Such a diet can be followed by any person in normal\r\nhealth, who is leading a physically active life. I have known a number\r\nof people, old and young, to start out upon this way of life without\r\nany preliminaries, and they have noted a great gain in health and\r\nefficiency, and have had no trouble of any sort. This diet is as cheap\r\nas the bean and white flour and rice diet of the ordinary \"vegetarian,\"\r\nand it is, by all odds, the simplest and most convenient diet in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI have been accustomed all my life to think of meat as a very \"heavy\"\r\narticle of food, an article of food suited for men doing hard physical\r\nlabor; it is a curious fact that the view I am setting forth here is\r\nprecisely the opposite. So long as I am doing hard physical labor,\r\nwhether it is walking ten miles a day, or playing tennis, or building a\r\nhouse, I get along perfectly upon the raw food; but when I settle down\r\nfor long periods of thinking and writing--often sitting for six hours\r\nwithout moving from one position--I find that I need something else,\r\nand nothing has answered that purpose quite so well as beef-steak. It\r\nappears to be, so far as I am concerned, the most easily digested and\r\nmost easily assimilated of foods. And because the work that I am doing\r\nseems to me to be important, I am willing to make the sacrifice of\r\nmoney and time and trouble which it necessitates. My diet at such times\r\nwill consist of beef or chicken, shredded wheat biscuit, and a little\r\nfruit. If any one is disposed to follow my example and make this\r\nexperiment, I beg to call his attention especially to the fact that I\r\nname these three kinds of food, and none others; and that I mean these\r\nthree kinds and none others. The main trouble with advising anybody to\r\neat meat is that he proceeds to eat it in the everyday world, where\r\nit means not the eating of broiled lean beef, but also of bacon and\r\neggs, and of bread and butter, and of potatoes with cream gravy, and of\r\nrice pudding and crackers and cheese and coffee. Please do not proceed\r\nto eat these things and then hold meat-eating responsible for the\r\nconsequences.\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment wish to give the impression that I believe that\r\nmeat-eating is necessary to a normally active person, or that humanity\r\nwill always continue to eat meat. No invention of science can ever make\r\nmeat as cheap a food as nuts and fruit, and nothing can ever make it\r\nas beautiful or attractive a food, nor as clean a food, nor as easily\r\nprepared a food. I believe that children can be brought up without\r\nknowing the taste of meat, and can be trained to lead normal and active\r\nlives from the very beginning, and can live on the raw-food diet and\r\nthrive. What I am discussing here are my own experiences, and I do not\r\nregard myself as a normal specimen of humanity, because I work a great\r\ndeal harder than anybody has a right to work. I do that because there\r\nare so many idle and useless people in the world at present--and some\r\nhave to make martyrs of themselves, until conditions of injustice and\r\ncruelty have been done away with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nSOME LETTERS FROM FASTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON, ONTARIO, May 2, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your article in a recent magazine very greatly interested\r\nme. My sister, on her way home from a five-and-a-half-weeks' visit\r\nin Boston and New York, where she had been endeavoring to discover\r\nthe causes of her frightful headaches, bought that number of the\r\nmagazine and read your experience, with, as you can well imagine, a\r\ndeep interest. In Boston she had consulted one of the two physicians\r\nsupposed to head the profession (as consultants) in that city. This\r\nman told her she had Bright's disease and leakage of the heart, and\r\nhe gave her ten years to live--if she was very careful. As she has\r\nfive children under twelve years of age, this was a sad outlook. She\r\nweighed 122 pounds when she left--and this was the lowest weight since\r\nearly girlhood--but on her return, weighed on the same scales in the\r\nsame clothing, she was only 108 pounds. She looked _very_ bad, and her\r\nspirits were at zero.\r\n\r\nYour article appealed to her, and she would have unhesitatingly tried\r\nyour remedy, but that she was pregnant, and thought it would probably\r\nmean the child's death. The Boston obstetrician, who was consulted,\r\nsaid, if the other doctor's diagnosis was correct, the child would have\r\nto be taken at eight months.\r\n\r\nAfter reading your experience, I said to my sister: \"You cannot perhaps\r\nfollow Mr. Sinclair's example, but you can approximate to it. If you\r\ngo to your own doctor he will undoubtedly send you to some sanatorium\r\nwhere the patients are fairly stuffed. Suppose you come over to my\r\nplace each noon and take dinner, having eaten only _a very light\r\nbreakfast_; then rest from two to five, take a long bath when you rise,\r\ngo for a walk from six to six-thirty, and then to your own home for\r\ntea, taking only a shredded wheat biscuit for that meal.\"\r\n\r\nMy sister consented, and on Saturday was weighed. On that light diet,\r\nand in twelve days, she had gained fourteen pounds. Her color is\r\nreturning, she does not tire as she did, and we are full of hope that\r\nshe may recover.\r\n\r\nMy object in writing was to thank you for your frank recital of ills\r\nand aches and their cure, and to get from you the names of the books to\r\nwhich you referred.\r\n\r\nSeveral of my friends have read your articles on my recommendation, and\r\none at least is seriously considering a lengthened fast. Reading the\r\narticle took me back to the \"no-breakfast régime,\" which I followed for\r\nfive years, and then, for no especial reason, abandoned. Already I feel\r\nmuch better.\r\n\r\nSincerely and gratefully,\r\nM. R. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKOWHEGAN, MAINE, May 30, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I read your article in the _Cosmopolitan_ with deep\r\ninterest, and am to-day on my seventh day's fast. My sensations thus\r\nfar are exactly like yours. I shall fast until hunger returns, if it\r\ntake a month.\r\n\r\nMy age is forty-eight, and I have enjoyed the best of health nearly all\r\nmy life. Even now my digestion is all right, but for five years or so I\r\nhave been troubled with rheumatism, not the painful, swelling sort, but\r\nlame joints.\r\n\r\nI tried \"Fletcherism,\" and for the last nine months have done my best\r\nto live up to his suggestions, but fell down, exactly as in your own\r\ncase. I can't tell what to eat, or when I have eaten enough.\r\n\r\nWhether this fast of yours does me any permanent good or not, my joints\r\ncertainly move better to-day than for six months, and I have every\r\nconfidence in the theory. The physicians here to a man all laugh at me,\r\nlikewise my friends. I had lost ten pounds in weight at the end of the\r\nsixth day; I lost three the first, two each for the next two days, and\r\na pound a day for the next three days.\r\n\r\nYou speak of an unmistakable appetite. I could eat, of course, now,\r\nthough I have no appetite, and I am wondering how I shall know when a\r\nreal appetite returns. Mrs. W. is as keen to try the fasting cure as\r\nI, and her condition is very like Mrs. Sinclair's, but I thought one\r\nmember of the family was enough for the first try-out. Please pardon\r\na total stranger for encroaching upon the time of a busy man, but in\r\nthe hunt for health, without which life is not worth living, one will\r\ndo things he would not otherwise think of. For your information I will\r\nsay that I have attended to my office and business every day since my\r\nfast began, walking to my home and back at least three times daily, for\r\nthe exercise; driving a touring-car nights and Sunday, for pleasure,\r\nexactly as though there had been no change in my habits. The strangest\r\npart of the experience is that I feel so well, and except for a slight\r\nfaintness, feel perfectly well to-day. Say--but I was hungry for the\r\nfirst two days!\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nHERBERT WENTWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLYDE PARK, MONT., May 17, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was much interested in your article in the _Cosmopolitan_\r\non \"Starving for Health's Sake.\" For some time before I read it I\r\nhad been troubled with a coated tongue and a nasty, bitter taste in\r\nmy mouth. When I read the article my complaint was probably at its\r\nworst. I consulted a doctor, who gave me some capsules to clean out my\r\nintestinal canal, so he said. I asked him what I could eat and he said,\r\n\"The less you eat the better.\" So I ate nothing for a week. Everything\r\nconnected with my fast for that week was just as you described it--a\r\nravenous hunger on the second day and after that no hunger at all.\r\nHowever, the coated tongue was still there, and when I next saw the\r\ndoctor I mentioned your article and said you recommended rectal\r\ninjections. He said he read your article and approved of it, and said\r\nafter a thorough examination that I had an impaction of the colon. He\r\nsaid he would give me something to work on my colon and also added that\r\nif I fasted long enough the impaction would move out of itself. He also\r\nrecommended injections. On the 25th day, although the coated tongue\r\nand nasty taste were still with me, I commenced eating again, as there\r\nwas so much work to do on the ranch, and I had to do it, as hired help\r\nwas scarce. I drank nothing but tepid water and very thin lemonade,\r\nslightly sweetened, during my fast of twenty-four days. I dropped from\r\n175 pounds to 143 pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is a week now since I broke my fast and I am rapidly gaining weight.\r\nYesterday I weighed 152 pounds. However, as I said, I still have the\r\ncoated tongue, although not so bad as formerly, and when I regain more\r\nweight, I'm going to begin another fast. I am fifty-three years of age,\r\nand have never used tea, coffee, whisky, or tobacco. I want to read up\r\non the subject, so that when I begin again I'll know what to do. Your\r\narticle was all the literature I had on the subject, and it may have\r\nbeen incomplete in a great many important particulars.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\nROBERT AITKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHICAGO, ILL., May 22, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I think you will be interested to learn the experience of my\r\nwife, who tried your fast, with the same results as your wife, over\r\nwhich we are very much delighted.\r\n\r\nAllow me to say that it was all done on the quiet, and no one knew of\r\nit until it was all over. And then, of course, every one thought she\r\nwas raving crazy, but she has since shown her friends that it was just\r\nthe thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it appealed to her, and she went into it with\r\n_faith_. She fasted for eleven days, after the second day was never\r\nhungry at all, and really began to take nourishment before she was\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing came out exactly as in your cases and was most\r\ninteresting. She had temperature the first two days and ate crushed\r\nice. After that, hot or cold water as desired. The tongue was coated\r\nvery badly and her breath very bad. The tongue cleared very slowly and\r\nwas quite discouraging, but after a few days was clear again. She lost\r\nover ten pounds, all of which has been regained and more, too, and she\r\nis gaining all the time. Complexion very clear, and the picture of\r\nhealth. Appetite great, eats everything, no aches or pains of any kind,\r\nand, best of all, no constipation, which was what she tried the fast\r\nfor. She lost no strength to speak of and didn't have to take to bed at\r\nall; in fact, did everything about the house as usual.\r\n\r\nEverything has been fine now for three weeks, and if the troubles\r\nreturn, she is to fast again and do it right, and will take no\r\nnourishment until the tongue clears.\r\n\r\nShe took internal baths nearly every day, and was astonished at\r\nthe results when nothing but water was being taken. While we don't\r\nrecommend it for every one, it certainly has been a godsend in this\r\ncase, and I believe because it was done right and with faith that it\r\nwas just the thing for her. You certainly have one convert, and if this\r\ninterests you, shall be pleased to know it.\r\n\r\nYours very sincerely,\r\nC. D. F.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOXVILLE, TENN., June 5, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to you for a\r\nrestoration to such health of body and clarity of mind as I have not\r\nknown since my sixteenth year, when first I entered the high school.\r\nThat was twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nI read your article, \"Starving for Health's Sake,\" in the\r\n_Cosmopolitan_, and, as you may recollect, asked you for information as\r\nto certain books treating of the fast as a cure for disease.\r\n\r\nInstead of answering me fully, you referred my case to the Bernarr\r\nMacfadden Institution in Chicago, for which I thank you, but I did not\r\ngo there because I had neither time nor money for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThrough a local book-dealer I ordered a copy of \"Fasting, Hydrotherapy\r\nand Exercise,\" but after two weeks of waiting it failed to arrive, so\r\nwith your _Cosmopolitan_ article as my only guide and sum total of\r\nknowledge as to the fast, I quit eating on May 13 and did not take\r\nanything except water until the morning of May 26. Even then I was not\r\nhungry, but as I did not care to remain away from work any longer I\r\nbroke the fast on the morning of the 26th. I lost thirteen pounds in\r\nweight, but was never too weak not to move around. I worked in the\r\noffice for seven days, and the balance of the time remained at home,\r\nbasking in the sunshine and reading constantly.\r\n\r\nMy health and appetite are in such perfect condition I can eat anything\r\nwithout fear of ulterior consequences.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the fast, I have sloughed off all my impedimenta of\r\ndisease. Constipation of ten years' standing is gone as if by magic.\r\nPiles and resulting pruritis of eight years' tearing torture are\r\nnightmares of the past. Bronchitis and eczema of scalp have vanished.\r\nAsthma, due to nervous sympathy with the pneumogastric nerve, is\r\nno more. Catarrhal deafness, sore throat, intestinal catarrh, and\r\na general neurasthenic condition have left me. Work was never so\r\npleasant. I cannot get enough of physical exercise, it seems; my\r\nmuscles seem to grow stronger as the exercise proceeds, and my weight\r\nis going upward about a pound daily. I am now three pounds heavier than\r\nI was before my fast began.\r\n\r\nLife was never so beautiful, hope and joy never so green, the future\r\nfor me and humanity's great movement toward a better day and higher\r\ngood of existence never seemed so reasonable and possible of every\r\nrealization as now, in the full possession of physical health and\r\nmental strength which have come back to me.\r\n\r\nHeretofore my work has been wrought out in pain.\r\n\r\nI am through with drugs. I graduated from allopathy long ago, then took\r\nup homeopathy and have now discarded it. I have spent over $500 in the\r\nlast ten years trying to get well on medicines. These professional\r\nquacks bled me for a living and knew not how to cure me. Your article\r\nwas written in the spirit of wishing to help suffering man. It cost me\r\nonly thirty cents to use your method, viz.: six feet of rubber tubing\r\nto make a siphon to take two enemas daily. For that thirty cents I\r\nobtained relief a million-fold more beneficial than from $500 worth of\r\nmedicine. Nay more, from your fasting idea I got rid of $500 worth of\r\npoisoning during ten years of medical superstition.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\nH. E. HOOVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHWEST SOCIETY ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, SEATTLE, WASH.\r\nNov. 5, 1910.\r\n\r\nEDITOR _Cosmopolitan_ MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nAm enclosing clipping which shows that prominent men up here in the\r\ngreat Northwest are not afraid to try out certain methods of fighting\r\ndisease merely because they are thought to be \"new\" or \"faddy\" (tho' in\r\ntruth the fast cure is as old as the Old Testament).\r\n\r\nThe value of Professor Colvin's fast experience seems to be that he has\r\ngiven to the world the best method of breaking the fast and getting\r\non to a solid-food diet. Upton Sinclair said the breaking of the fast\r\nis the most important part of it, and would be the most dangerous were\r\nit not for the great natural food, milk, which tides you over. But he\r\nfails to remember there are thousands with whom milk does not agree,\r\nsick or well.\r\n\r\nShortly after interview noted in enclosed clipping from Seattle\r\n_Times_, Professor Colvin attempted to begin to break the fast with\r\norange juices and utterly failed. He then tried milk and was made so\r\nsick that he had to fast for three more days to get into a condition\r\nto break the fast. He then started in with a very light veal broth\r\n(not soup, nor tea). He soon got so he could take a cup of it every\r\nhour and a half. To get on to solid food he tried a few crackers with\r\nthe broth, but found too much soda in the crackers and abandoned their\r\nuse. Finally he hit upon the very thing that fitted the condition of\r\nhis body, dry whole-wheat bread toasted. This toasted whole-wheat bread\r\nhe had his cook crush with a rolling pin into a powder and each day\r\nmixed more of it with the cup of broth. After this he filled the cup\r\nthree-fourths full of this toast powder and only poured in as much\r\nbroth as the dust would absorb, making a solid gruel, which was very\r\nappetizing and nourishing (so much so that the professor continues to\r\nuse it for breakfast food though his fast is closed). Now to this gruel\r\nhe added mashed baked potato from time to time (more each time) until\r\nhe virtually supplanted the toast dust. From this he went to baked\r\napple, thence to raw eggs, thence to macaroni, thence to pigeon squab,\r\nand thence to solid earth.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that his discovery of the broth-toast-gruel method is\r\na great discovery. Especially so for those who live in the cities and\r\ncannot be sure as to the absolute purity of their milk. Even when the\r\nmilk diet can be used it does not afford a solution for getting off of\r\na liquid diet on to a solid food basis.\r\n\r\nIn your July number appears a letter from Mr. Buel of New York in which\r\nhe says that it would be almost criminal to permit any one advanced\r\nin years to enter upon the dangerous folly of the \"fast cure.\" I am\r\nenclosing you a clipping from the _Oregonian_, telling of the fasting\r\nexperiences of Professor Colvin's friend, Rev. J. E. Fitch. Rev. Fitch\r\nis 81 years of age and a year ago took it into his head to out-fast\r\nMoses. Holy Writ says that Moses fasted 40 days, and to prove to his\r\ncongregation that one did not have to be superstitious to believe some\r\nof these Old Testament tales, Rev. J. E. Fitch, at the age of 80,\r\nfasted fifty days; and instead of losing flesh towards the last part of\r\nhis fast actually gained in weight. He is as vigorous to-day as he was\r\nat 21.\r\n\r\nYour Mr. Buel spoke of fasters as cranks and faddists and intimated\r\nthat your solid citizen would not thus be led astray. Professor Colvin\r\nis not a crank but one of our best citizens, being well known both in\r\nthis country and Europe, and spoken of as the probable president of\r\nthe Pan-American University to be located in Porto Rico.\r\n\r\nVery respectfully,\r\nTHOS. F. MURPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\n210 Merriman Ave.,\r\nASHEVILLE, N. C., 9/11/10.\r\n\r\nMR. UPTON SINCLAIR,\r\nARDEN, DEL.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After fasting for ten days I went off for ten days. Then\r\non for seventeen days, during which time I got rid of a long list\r\nof troubles, except a cough, for which I underwent examination by a\r\nspecialist. I found I had tuberculosis. The entire upper right lobe of\r\nmy lung and about half of the left upper lung being affected. Now I\r\nam up here making a very rapid recovery. I consider that the fasts I\r\ntook were the best things that could have happened for me, since they\r\neliminated a bunch of troubles that are nearly always present with\r\ntuberculosis, such as indigestion, sore throat, rheumatism, etc. All of\r\nthese left me, and I never felt better in my life than since fasting.\r\nI do not believe that such a rapid recovery as I am making could be\r\npossible had I not fasted. Fasting did not cure the tuberculosis,\r\nbut it gave me an excellent stomach, with which to fight it, and\r\ntuberculosis will always give way to a good stomach. I did not know I\r\nhad tuberculosis when I started fasting, but I now know, since learning\r\nmore about the disease, that I had the trouble in an active state\r\nmore than nine months before I fasted. My cough got very tame during\r\nthe fast and very nearly disappeared, but returned as I increased the\r\namount of food I took after breaking the fast, but at no time did it\r\nget as bad as it was previous to the fast. I weighed 172 lbs. in May,\r\nwhen I began my fasting and dropped to 148 lbs., and now weigh 180\r\nlbs. and never felt better in my life. Have but a slight spot of the\r\ntuberculosis affection left in my right lung.\r\n\r\nWhile I would not recommend others affected with tuberculosis to fast,\r\nI would ask that if you have any letters from consumptives who have\r\nfasted I would appreciate a copy.\r\n\r\nROLAND A. WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND, Sept. 10, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SINCLAIR,--Your article \"The Truth about Fasting\" in August\r\n_Physical Culture_ to hand this week has much interested me. The\r\nquestions you ask at end of article will, I hope, receive many replies,\r\nand give much information regarding the fasting cure. I, personally,\r\ncan supply a considerable amount of just such information as you\r\nrequire, but the fact that I am a druggist in business precludes\r\nthe giving of such for publication until drugs and I part company.\r\nLet me explain. A little under four years ago I came upon a copy of\r\n_Physical Culture_. It interested me and I followed up the reading\r\nby subscribing, and obtaining various books--Dewey's, Hazzard's,\r\nCarrington's, Desmond's, Eales', Bell's and others. I became quite\r\nconvinced that about 99 per cent of usual medical treatment was wrong,\r\nand, in fact, actually detrimental, and often death-dealing to those\r\nwho were in search of health. More and more I felt that I was doing a\r\nbig injustice to those who applied to me for help, and an accessory\r\nin bad practice by the dispensing of physician's prescriptions. Yet I\r\nknow that, like myself, the great bulk of the doctors and chemists were\r\nacting innocently and even conscientiously when recommending drugs and\r\npracticing the accepted drug and surgical treatments. The belief that\r\ndrugs cure disease is so deeply rooted in the average human mind, and\r\nthe teachings in medical and druggists' colleges so universal, and even\r\nthorough, that doctors and druggists can hardly be blamed for holding\r\nto their mother-loves.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had an open mind, and a desire to hand out a square deal,\r\nand decided to make a practical test of the new teachings that had come\r\nmy way.\r\n\r\nI started by carefully selecting my patients--those who I believed had\r\na fair amount of intelligence, and whose ailments had supplied them\r\nwith a fairly long course of pain, worry and expense. Being a druggist\r\nin business, it would have been a very foolish thing for me to have\r\nwholly condemned drugs. And that is one reason why I selected chronics\r\nfor a start--I was able to use the argument that as drugs had had a\r\nlong and faithful trial, and had proven valueless in curing, a fast of\r\nnine or ten days would be, at least, worth a trial. My first case was a\r\nlady about thirty-five years of age. Complaint, badly swollen, highly\r\ninflamed and ulcerated leg, extending from two inches below knee to\r\none inch above ankle, and more than half way around. She proved a good\r\npatient. The leg had been bad with more or less severity for fourteen\r\nyears, and had been treated by several doctors, druggists, and others.\r\nShe started on an immediate fast. Within twenty-four hours after fast\r\ncommenced, the inflammation decreased; by the end of the fourth day it\r\nhad entirely subsided, and by the end of the eighth day not a vestige\r\nof the trouble remained. This fast took place over two years ago--she\r\nhas held reasonably well to the simple foods I advised, and so far\r\nthere has been no return of the ailment. Her general health has very\r\nconsiderably improved.\r\n\r\nSince then I have treated, perhaps, fifty cases by fasting, and many\r\nothers by simple dieting. Many complete cures have been effected that\r\nordinary medical methods had entirely failed to benefit. My list\r\ncomprises many ailments, ranging from one to forty-five years in\r\nevidence, while the patients themselves have ranged in age from one\r\nyear to eighty-five years.\r\n\r\nX. ----\r\n\r\n\r\nHASTINGS, MICH., Sept. 11, 1910.\r\n\r\nEDITOR, THE _Cosmopolitan_.\r\n\r\nEvery reader of your magazine owes you a vote of thanks for the Upton\r\nSinclair article on fasting.\r\n\r\nMr. Sinclair said, \"There are three dangers attending the fast.\" In my\r\ncase there were four--the danger of being sent to the Insane Asylum.\r\n\r\nAll my neighbors and relations had the utmost contempt for what they\r\ntermed \"my craziness.\" But notwithstanding all this, I fasted fourteen\r\ndays, and stomach trouble, heart trouble, kidney trouble, chronic\r\ncatarrh, and rheumatism, which for years had made life a burden, are\r\nno more. I do not have to tell my friends, at this date, that it was a\r\nsuccess, they know it. My family physician has since said that it was\r\nprobably the best thing I ever did in my life.\r\n\r\nI consider myself greatly indebted to you for furnishing me so\r\nefficient a remedy, free of cost.\r\n\r\nGratefully yours,\r\n\r\nMRS. E. L. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nUPTON SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yes, you may use my name in connection with my experience.\r\n\r\nAs I did not take a complete fast the first time, I began again Sept.\r\n4th, and fasted thirteen days, when natural hunger returned. Had none\r\nof the unpleasant experiences of the first fast. Was able to be on my\r\nfeet and work more than at any time in years.\r\n\r\nChronic rheumatism had caused sinewy swelling of my knee joints, that\r\nin turn had caused numbness of the feet and lower limbs, making it\r\nimpossible for me to be on my feet. What I have suffered with them from\r\njar of people walking across the room, or brushing against them, cannot\r\nbe told. The first fast removed all the pain and soreness. The last\r\nfast has brought them down to normal or nearly so. I am confident that\r\nI shall soon be able to walk any reasonable distance.\r\n\r\nYou are certainly entitled to a place among the public benefactors of\r\nthe age for giving to the people the knowledge you had gained by the\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nGratefully yours,\r\n\r\nMRS. E. L. RAYMOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n20 Bowdoin St., BOSTON, MASS.\r\nAug. 1, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have just read with much interest your article in\r\n_Physical Culture_ and am minded to send you a brief account of my\r\nexperience, which has been in some respects more full than your own.\r\nIn speaking thus, I refer to the fact that my fasts, though not of so\r\nlong duration as many reported, were complete in this: that my blood\r\nand tissue had cleaned up, my mouth was sweet, tongue moist, and there\r\nwere plenty of the digestive fluids and a call for good plain wholesome\r\nfood, which was slowly eaten and perfectly digested, and my appetite\r\nwas perfectly satisfied with a very moderate amount.\r\n\r\nI suffered severely from indigestion and rheumatism, and made up my\r\nmind to try the effect of complete abstinence from food till I was\r\nbetter. I was familiar with the writings of Dr. Dewey and was well\r\nconvinced that he was correct in his views. I was in my office the\r\nmorning of Jan. 1st, and the bookkeeper remarked as to how ill I\r\nlooked. Seven days after that (the first seven days of my fast) I was\r\nin again, and he spoke of my greatly improved appearance, said I\r\nlooked very much better. He did not know nor did I tell him the reason\r\nfor the improvement. On the 12th day--the first after I had broken the\r\nfast--he said I looked much better, which was also true, but when I\r\ngave him an explanation of the reason, he would not believe in it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn none of the four fasts which I have taken have I set any time limit\r\nor taken it as a stunt at all, but only have been guided by conditions\r\nas they developed. In no instance have I failed, and in no case was\r\nfood a temptation to me until natural hunger returned. It seems to me\r\nan error to attempt to gauge the length of the fast. We ought to be\r\ngoverned by nature's direction. A \"wise dog\" knows when he needs to\r\nfast, and fasts till he wants food. It seems to me when we get to that\r\npoint of wisdom, to know as much as the dog, we will know enough to go\r\nby intelligent needs instead of the clock.\r\n\r\nMy experience is not in accord with the view expressed in your article\r\nas regards weakness of stomach and lack of peristalsis after fasting.\r\nIt is my experience that after a complete fast any plain food desired\r\ncan be taken without harm. I do not favor imprudence, of course, but I\r\ndo not think that there is any good reason for being compelled to take\r\nfluid foods unless one desires to. My longest fast was nineteen days.\r\n\r\nC. D. NORRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n39 Rue Singer, PARIS, FRANCE.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I read your article in the May _Cosmopolitan_ and was very\r\nmuch impressed with the ideas you advocated. I had for twenty years\r\nbeen troubled with constipation, which caused colds and grippe, besides\r\nmaking me very sluggish. Being a singer and teacher, these things were\r\ngreat handicaps on my work, so after reading your article I decided to\r\ntry it. I was in Paris studying singing with Oscar Seagle and Jean de\r\nReszke, and of course I needed to be at my very best all the time, but\r\nI wasn't. I couldn't keep from taking cold, which always knocked me\r\nout of a week or two of work. So when my teachers went away for their\r\nvacation, I decided to start the fast, and on July 31 I did so. Being\r\na coffee \"toper,\" it made it very hard for me to give up my breakfast\r\ncup of strong black coffee, but I did it and the first three or four\r\ndays I nearly lost my mind. Never experienced anything in my life that\r\nrequired so much will power. However, I stuck to it, but I was very\r\nhungry and had a splitting headache for four days, after which it got\r\na little better. Then about the fifth day, as my hunger began to leave\r\nme, I began to break out as if I had measles--this kept up for five\r\nor six days. To add to that, my mouth and throat became inflamed and\r\nvery sore, and that didn't cure up until about the twelfth day of the\r\nfast. I was exceedingly miserable all these days, but I realized how\r\nmuch I needed something of the kind to get the terrible poison out of\r\nmy system, so I just held on and drank much water, and walked in the\r\nsunshine all I could. My tongue had a thick coat on it and I had a\r\nterrible bilious taste in my mouth for twelve days. I believed it would\r\ntake about twenty days to fix me up just right, so I was going ahead\r\nwhen I suddenly decided to make a hurried business trip back to Texas;\r\nso on the fourteenth day I sailed from Cherbourg without having broken\r\nmy fast.\r\n\r\nI carried a dozen oranges on board with me to make sure. When I began\r\nto breathe the salt air I got hungry, so on the fifteenth day I began\r\nto eat oranges and kept it up for a day and a half and then tried to\r\nget some milk, but could get none that was good, and most of what I got\r\nwas of the condensed variety. I did the best I could for four days,\r\nwhen my system rebelled and became clogged up and I took another cold\r\nas usual. So I decided not to eat another mouthful on that ship, and I\r\nkept the fast up until I got to Ft. Worth. Then I went at the matter\r\naccording to your instructions, and the results were perfect. I took\r\nup oranges for two days, then went on the milk diet for two days, then\r\nbegan on the boiled wheat. The results have been highly satisfactory.\r\nGoing from a cold climate like Paris into a veritable inferno like\r\nTexas in summer made it very hard on me, but the wheat diet did\r\neverything for me and gave me unusual strength and vigor even in that\r\nhot climate where vigor doesn't abound much in hot weather. All my\r\ntroubles seemed to disappear. I had not sung a tone since I began the\r\nfirst fast in Paris, so I began to practice again, and I never realized\r\nsuch a change in anything. Everything went so easy and all my friends\r\nsaid that they never saw such improvement in a human voice. I have\r\nnever even desired to taste coffee. I am living on wheat, nuts, all\r\nkinds of fruit and vegetables, and the result is everything you said it\r\nwould be. I have completed my business in Texas and will start back to\r\nParis to-day. I am preparing myself for the journey this time. I have\r\na large \"thermos\" bottle which I have filled with wheat and will carry\r\nplenty of fruit and nuts.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your information along the line of health.\r\nYou have been a great blessing to me, and I am sure you have been also\r\nto thousands of others.\r\n\r\nANDREW HEMPHILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOMAHA, NEB.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SINCLAIR,--I was so fascinated with the story of your fast\r\nthat I immediately made the experiment for myself, abstaining entirely\r\nfrom food of any kind for five days.\r\n\r\nI had no particular ailment which seemed to need the fast cure, but\r\nfelt impelled to do a little investigating on my own account.\r\n\r\nI kept a diary in which I recorded each day's experience, including\r\nloss in weight, effect of cold bath, amount of exercise taken, etc.\r\nWithout going into details, I can simply say I was astonished by the\r\nresults. While in one respect my experience differed from yours, in\r\nthat the desire for food did not entirely cease at any time, I was\r\nsurprised to find how easily it could be controlled after the first\r\nday. Since the fast I have kept on drinking large quantities of pure\r\nwater--resulting in a gain in weight of twelve pounds, increased\r\ndigestive powers and a wonderfully improved appetite.\r\n\r\nI am frank to say I was never so pleased with, nor so greatly benefited\r\nby anything ever previously extracted from a magazine article.\r\n\r\nR. E. WHEELER.\r\n\r\n\r\n750 PENOBSCOT B'LD'G, DETROIT,\r\nOct. 19, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SINCLAIR,--Complying with your suggestion, will hurriedly\r\nand briefly group my experiences through a fast which I took largely\r\nbecause of your persuasive article on that subject. I absorbed the\r\ninformation you gave as well as I could, and having been a great\r\nsufferer for over twenty years with stomach and bowel troubles, began\r\na fast which I continued for nearly eleven days, adhering scrupulously\r\nto the program outlined by you, in so far as I could practically do\r\nso, except I took only one bath (tepid) daily before retiring and\r\nomitted the enemas after the fifth day. Am fifty-seven years of age,\r\npowerfully built and athletic in habit and practice. Normal weight\r\naround two hundred pounds, height six feet one and one-half inches.\r\nVarious causes reduced my weight some four years ago to about one\r\nhundred and eighty-five pounds, and almost constant non-assimilation\r\nof foods prevented my regaining normal weight. Weight an hour previous\r\nto my last lunch prior to the fast, one hundred and eighty-six pounds;\r\nlost fourteen pounds during the fast, eight of which fell off me the\r\nfirst three days. My indigestion had for years been accompanied by\r\ndistressing, persistent constipation. This did not yield until the\r\nafternoon of fourth day of fast, when my entire intestinal functions\r\nseemed to become normal, and although I had taken no food, solid or\r\nliquid, no fruit juices, coffee, tea or milk, absolutely nothing in\r\nfast except Detroit River water, hot or cold, as fancy suggested, after\r\nthe fourth day the bowels inclined to movement at least twice during\r\neach twenty-four hours. Lost strength gradually throughout fast, but\r\nlooked after essentials in my office from six down to three hours the\r\nlast day. I had no pronounced desire for food from first to last.\r\nTongue remained heavily furred throughout the fast, breath offensive,\r\neven to myself. I sat at table at breakfast and evening meals, serving\r\nsame, but using only a cup or two of hot water as my portion. Voice\r\nlost resonancy and timbre, and I finally felt so enervated that I broke\r\nthe fast--juice of an orange first evening, and of five oranges the\r\nsecond day; of six oranges the third day, during which I also sipped a\r\nquart of rich milk, hot. Fourth day ate six oranges, two quarts milk,\r\nslice of old bread and about three-fourths pound juicy steak, after\r\nwhich I soon began to eat more than the usual quantity of wholesome\r\nfood. For over four months had no indigestion, bowels regular and\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nI am hoping to see my way clear to fast again soon, for am needing\r\na brace physically.... I owe you grateful thanks for inciting me to\r\nundertake the remedy.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes for your continued success, usefulness and happiness.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nM. E. HALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my discussion of the question of what to eat, I have referred to the\r\nmeat diet, and also to the raw-food diet. By way of throwing further\r\nlight upon the problem, I reprint here two letters, one by a follower\r\nof Dr. Salisbury, and the other by a man whom I was instrumental in\r\nstarting upon raw food. The latter article is reprinted from _Physical\r\nCulture_, by courtesy of Mr. Bernarr Macfadden. The reader may find it\r\ndifficult to understand how two people can have had such apparently\r\ncontradictory experiences. I myself, however, have no doubt of the\r\nliteral truth of their statements, for I know dozens of people who are\r\nthriving upon each of these diets. It is to me only a further proof of\r\nthe fact that our knowledge of this subject is as yet in its infancy,\r\nand that all one can do is to experiment, and find out what system best\r\nagrees with his own organism.\r\n\r\n\r\n504 West Second St.,\r\nLOS ANGELES, CAL., July 28, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As you say in the August _Physical Culture_ that you would\r\nlike to hear the experiences of fasters, I will tell you of mine. In\r\n1889-1890 I was very sick with catarrh of the stomach and bowels, which\r\ndeveloped into consumption of the bowels accompanied by inflammatory\r\nrheumatism. On May 1st, 1890, I went to the office of Dr. James H.\r\nSalisbury and treated with him for one year. During the first nine\r\nmonths I ate nothing but Salisbury steaks, beginning with one ounce per\r\nmeal and increasing gradually as I could assimilate it to one pound per\r\nmeal, and drank a pint of hot water an hour and a half before meals and\r\nat bedtime. Salisbury steak, as you probably know, is beef pulp,--round\r\nsteak with all fat and fibres removed. I dropped weight rapidly, going\r\nfrom 140 pounds to 90 pounds as this loss was diseased flesh. I then\r\ngained as rapidly on beef alone and this was good hard flesh. During\r\nthe next three months he allowed me a slice of toasted bread at two\r\nmeals daily in addition to the meat. For the past twenty years I have\r\neaten meat three times a day with other foods, consequently have not\r\nneeded a physician in that time. I have foolish spells occasionally\r\nand indulge in fruit, vegetables and cereals, and destroy the proper\r\nratio, viz: 2/3 of meat to 1/3 of other foods, then I begin to get out\r\nof shape and this brings me to my fasting experiences,--about eight of\r\nthem in the last seventeen years and lasting from five to fifteen days\r\naccording to the time it took for my tongue to clear off. I find that\r\nthe more hot water I drink the quicker it clears; during the last fast\r\nthree years ago I drank one quart every two hours through the day. I\r\ngot my stomach so clean that the water tasted sweet--this is the test\r\nof a clean stomach.\r\n\r\nFasts have benefited me and I recommend them, as few people will\r\nlive on beef till their blood gets pure; that an exclusive diet of\r\nbeef _will_ make pure blood I saw demonstrated in New York at Dr.\r\nSalisbury's by microscopic tests of my own blood and that of others.\r\nWhen you are in this condition you can expose yourself as much as you\r\nlike without danger of taking cold. If people suffering with stomach\r\nand intestinal troubles, Bright's disease, diabetes, rheumatism,\r\nsciatica, or tuberculosis, would eat nothing but beef pulp and drink\r\nhot water before meals they would be cured in nine cases out of ten,\r\nas this was Dr. Salisbury's average of cures when they stuck to the\r\ntreatment. I acknowledge that one gets rid of a lot of diseased tissue\r\nwhile fasting, but not more rapidly than on the beef diet, and the\r\nlatter has the advantage that one is making good blood all the time. I\r\nconsider that you are doing a great work in recommending the fast cure,\r\nand agree with you that _Hamburg_ steak is not the best food to break a\r\nfast with, as it contains 1/4 to 1/3 of fat and \"animal fat is a lower\r\nform of organization, in fact is often a process of degeneration.\" I\r\nhave seen several Salisbury patients have slight bilious attacks from\r\neating over-fat beef, but they quickly recovered by eating leaner beef.\r\nBeef pulp is the best thing to eat after a fast as it is absorbed\r\nquickly into the circulation and I never saw a patient whose stomach\r\nwas too weak to digest it in small quantities, well broiled. I believe\r\nin dry foods, well masticated,--no slops.\r\n\r\nDr. Salisbury said to me \"a man whose food is beef can live in a hole\r\nin the ground and be healthy.\" His last words to me were, \"Stick to\r\nbeef and hot water the rest of your life and nothing but old age will\r\nkill you barring accident.\" I asked him how long he had lived on this\r\ndiet, he replied, \"thirty years.\"--\"Do you expect to die of old age?\"\r\n\"Sure.\" He died August 23rd, 1905, at the age of eighty-two from\r\nthe result of an accident. He was a most scientific and successful\r\npractitioner; but nearly all physicians, aside from those he cured,\r\ncalled his treatment a farce and a delusion because his teachings if\r\ngenerally followed would put the majority of them out of business. One\r\nNew York doctor told me while I was on the diet \"unless you give up\r\nbeef and hot water you will not live five years--you will wear your\r\nkidneys out.\" I replied, \"you doctors say I am going to die anyway, so\r\nI might as well die clean.\" I immediately increased my hot water from\r\none pint to one quart before each meal and have kept it up ever since.\r\nWhen I began drinking hot water I had a slight kidney and bladder\r\ntrouble; this has disappeared; the constant flushing has strengthened\r\nthese organs,--I am now sixty-four.\r\n\r\nCold water before meals is better than none, but is not as good as hot\r\nwater, as the latter does not chill the stomach or gripe one, and acts\r\nas a tonic on the internal organs; is more quickly absorbed and starts\r\nperspiration, causing the skin to share with the kidneys the work of\r\neliminating waste matter. If a person is not very sick he can eat his\r\nround steak (after removing the fat) ground without removing the fibre.\r\nFor a regular Salisbury steak leave the knife loose and clean the\r\ngrinder frequently.\r\n\r\nYou have a large contract in trying to force medical men to recognize\r\nthe fast cure. They even told me, \"while we think you are honest, you\r\nare mistaken; you did not see Dr. Salisbury perform the cures you think\r\nyou saw.\" The Doctor considered me one of his star patients; he said I\r\nwas as far gone as any man he ever saw cured by the treatment, and that\r\nhe would rather have three cases of tuberculosis of the lungs than one\r\nlike mine, my disease being in the last stage.\r\n\r\nYou can do as you like with this letter. I write simply to strengthen\r\nyou. Persist, you are on the right track at last. You are no \"shallow\r\nsensationalist.\" I like your writings.\r\n\r\nVery sincerely,\r\nJAS. Y. ANTHONY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRUIT AND NUT DIET\r\n\r\nFrom early childhood until January 9, 1910, or about twenty years\r\nin all, I had been a sufferer from asthma, and chronic catarrh in\r\naddition. As a child I was sick a great deal of the time, having\r\nregular attacks every few weeks, of such little troubles as bilious\r\nfevers, chills and la grippe, with pneumonia, typhoid, measles,\r\nwhooping cough and the like sprinkled in at times. I have taken\r\ngallons of castor oil, and pounds of calomel and quinine, I think. I\r\ndon't believe I ever had more than one cold, but I was never really\r\nfree of that.\r\n\r\nThe first attack of asthma came shortly after the disappearance of a\r\nsevere case of eczema, and from that time on throughout the entire\r\ntwenty years, I did not pass a single moderately cold night without\r\nhaving at least one, and more often, two and three spasms of asthma\r\nduring the night. These were relieved temporarily, only after sitting\r\nup in bed and inhaling, for several minutes, the smoke from a green\r\npowder which I burned for that purpose. Frequently attacks would last\r\ncontinually for three and four days or a week, during which time\r\nI was not able to draw a single free breath, and would suffer so\r\nintensely that on many occasions I felt as if I was breathing my last.\r\nI mention all this for fear some Salisbury followers may doubt that\r\nmine was a real genuine case of asthma. In that case, I think I can get\r\nsatisfactory evidence from our family physician and others who were\r\nwith me a great deal during that time.\r\n\r\nAs I grew older, and about the time I went to work for myself, I began\r\nto be interested in physical culture methods, and noticed a great\r\nimprovement by exercising and cutting down my diet, and afterwards\r\nadopting the two-meal-a-day plan. However, there was one thing which is\r\nstrongly emphasized in these methods that did not work with me at the\r\ntime, but seemed to make the asthma worse; and that was the fresh air\r\nidea. I always had better results, and the attacks were less frequent\r\nand not so severe, when I closed the windows and doors, and filled the\r\nroom with the smoke and fumes of the remedy I used. That was due mostly\r\nto the narcotic effect of the remedy when breathing the smoke and fumes\r\ncontinually. I mention this for fear some one may suggest that the\r\nultimate permanent relief was brought about simply by breathing fresh\r\nair continually when I did begin to open the windows.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, I ate meat with each meal, or twice daily.\r\n\r\nI began to notice that nuts and especially pecans, of which I am\r\nparticularly fond, and which are quite plentiful in that part of the\r\ncountry in which I live, seemed to have a decidedly bad effect on my\r\nasthma, and a greater part of the time I would not touch them on this\r\naccount. At that time, however, I had the impression that generally\r\nprevails among a large majority of people, that nuts or fruits were\r\nonly good for eating between meals, or as a dessert at the end of a\r\nmeal, and in addition to the regular food that was eaten; and that was\r\nthe way I had eaten them.\r\n\r\nMr. Upton Sinclair's first article in the _Physical Culture_ magazine\r\non the fruit and nut diet was the first hint I ever had that fruit\r\nand nuts eaten alone as a diet had any real substantial food value.\r\nFrom this time on I began experimenting with short fasts of one meal\r\nor one day, and also began substituting fruit for some meals, and at\r\nthe same time cut down my meat eating from twice daily to two or three\r\ntimes a week. I noticed a great improvement in both asthma and catarrh,\r\nalthough I continued having attacks of asthma almost every night, as\r\nthis was during the winter and most of the nights were quite cold.\r\n\r\nAfter the appearance of his second article, I determined to try this\r\ndiet out in my own case, hoping to lessen the attacks of asthma at\r\nleast, never dreaming of the real surprise that was in store for me. I\r\nfasted the last two days of December, 1909, and started in January 1st,\r\neating mostly acid fruits, such as lemons, oranges, grape fruit, etc.\r\n(This in order to relieve the constipation that I was then, and had\r\nbeen troubled with more or less for the past two or three years.) As a\r\nresult of the fast, and of what might be termed a partial fast for a\r\nfew days after, I lost several pounds in weight, which I did not regain\r\nuntil after I had been eating other fruits for several days, such as\r\ndates, figs, bananas and apples, also all kinds of nuts, including the\r\nmuch dreaded pecan, which seemed to cause so much trouble before.\r\n\r\nOn the night of January 8, 1910, I had my last attack of asthma, and\r\nhave had none since. By that time my bowels were perfectly free, and\r\nall traces of constipation gone. The night of the 9th I spent in\r\npeaceful, dreamless sleep, my head perfectly clear of any cold or\r\ncatarrh, enabling me to breathe freely through my nose during sleep,\r\nwhich had never been possible before this. Although the temperature\r\noutside was a little above zero, and stood close around there during\r\nthe greater part of January and February where I was, two windows in\r\nmy room were wide open all of the time, and I slept between them; also\r\nthere was no stove or other heating appliances in the room to warm me\r\non retiring and arising.\r\n\r\nI stuck rigidly to the fruit and nuts, living on them alone until\r\nthe weather began to grow warmer. I then grew so confident, that I\r\ngradually lapsed into a general raw-food diet, and later on, to a\r\npartly raw and partly cooked diet, but no meat at all, save at times,\r\nwhen it was necessary in order to avoid unpleasant controversies and\r\nexplanations among people who knew nothing on the subject, and were\r\ntherefore sceptical, and often inclined to ridicule me.\r\n\r\nWith the return to cooked foods, came a return of constipation, and\r\nwith it, traces of the old cold or catarrh. This is one thing I noticed\r\nin particular; that when my bowels were moving freely, then and only\r\nthen was I free of catarrh or cold. I am situated at present where I am\r\naway from the influences of kind-and-well-meaning friends and members\r\nof my own family, so am living on a raw-food diet entirely, doing heavy\r\ngymnasium work every day, also quite a bit of study and other brain\r\nwork besides, which in all keeps me quite busy most of the day. I am\r\nenjoying the best of health in every particular all the while.\r\n\r\nH. MITCHELL GODSEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RADER CASE\r\n\r\nMr. L. F. Rader of Olalla, Wash., died at 12.15 P. M., May 11, 1910, at\r\n123½ Broadway North, in the forty-seventh year of his age. Mr. Rader's\r\nphysical history is one of intermittent suffering. As the result of an\r\naccident in childhood in which he was internally injured, his youth\r\nand early manhood were filled with a succession of most acute attacks\r\nof painful illness. About fifteen years ago he deserted the orthodox\r\nmeans of treatment and turned to what is now known as the natural or\r\ndrugless method, with the consequence that he experienced the first\r\nrelief he had ever known. Three years ago he lay ill for three months,\r\nand after again submitting to medical treatment he turned to the fast\r\nand to me. In fourteen days he was up and about, and in a month he was\r\nable to attend to his ordinary business. Since then he had no return\r\nof acute symptoms until March 31 of this year, when, after unwonted\r\nphysical exercise and a heavy meal, he was seized with severe pains in\r\nthe intestines, which compelled him to take to his bed. His stomach\r\nrejected food, and within a week the taking of water brought nausea. I\r\nwas then called to diagnose the case and to direct treatment. I made\r\nthe statement at that time to Mrs. Rader that there seemed but little\r\nchance for his recovery, but tried the administration of fruit juices\r\nand light broths.\r\n\r\nThe point was soon reached, however, when Mr. Rader refused any\r\nsustenance, since it resulted only in nausea and excruciating pain.\r\nIn the meanwhile the patient came to Seattle, and went to the Hotel\r\nOutlook with every symptom showing the relief that is the logical\r\nsequence of removing food temporarily from a system struggling to\r\nright abnormal conditions. Things progressed smoothly until meddlesome\r\noutsiders interfered and caused the city health officials to take\r\ncognizance of the fact that a man was \"starving\" in the hotel. Without\r\nwarrant Mr. Rader's rooms were entered, and he was confronted by\r\nDrs. Bourns and Davidson, who endeavored to persuade him to return\r\nto orthodoxy and to the care of the orthodox physicians. Mr. Rader's\r\nindignant repudiation is of record, as is also the result of the\r\nattempt to declare him insane.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the latter, after his removal to a quiet,\r\ncomfortable room in the upper part of the city, an order of the court,\r\nobtained in some manner by the health officials, sent the humane\r\nofficers to the rescue, and the house was watched and guarded while the\r\nfaithful nurses prevented forcible entry attempted by these servants\r\nof the people. The latter even went so far as to raise ladders to\r\nthe window of Mr. Rader's room, and with display of weapons tried to\r\nforce the catches in the vain effort to serve the writ which was their\r\nexcuse. To prevent their seeing the patient and to save him as much\r\nas possible from the noisy disturbance, I carried him to the bath and\r\nlocked the door. I then climbed from one window to another across a\r\ncourt into the next flat in order to call the attorney for the humane\r\nsociety, who took the needful steps that eventually recalled the writ.\r\nIn the meanwhile Mr. Rader had suffered mentally to such an extent that\r\nhis life was despaired of for many hours, and he never fully recovered\r\nfrom the nervous shock, which undoubtedly hastened his end. Until the\r\ncoming of these officers he was able to walk from his room to the bath,\r\nbut afterwards he continually begged to be protected from outsiders and\r\nto be permitted to die, if need be, in peace.\r\n\r\nWhen the death of a patient under my care occurs I am most anxious that\r\nno stone should be left unturned to exhibit the cause. In this, my\r\nseventh death in four years' practice in Seattle, I find my diagnosis\r\nand prognosis completely corroborated. I was assisted in the autopsy by\r\ntwo old-line physicians and by the deputy coroner. The results of the\r\npost-mortem examination were as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. Rader's viscera showed the most abnormal characteristics it has\r\nbeen my fortune to observe in years of post-mortem work. The lungs\r\nwere adherent at every point to the pleural cavity as well as to the\r\ndiaphragm in places. The heart in fair condition. Stomach dilated and\r\nprolapsed. Gall bladder in three distinct pouches, any one of which was\r\nthe size of the normal sac, and two of these sections were filled with\r\n126 gall stones of one grain to half an ounce in weight; the largest\r\nwas 3 inches in circumference one way and 4 inches the other way. The\r\nsmall intestines collapsed to the pelvis and midway intussuscepted\r\nso that a section of two measured yards occupied but five inches in\r\nlength; portions of these were of infantile development. The transverse\r\ncolon lay anterior to the descending colon throughout its extent,\r\nwhile the ascending and descending colon showed infantile size and\r\ncartilaginous structure. The sigmoid bend and rectum were of diameter\r\nnot larger than the adult thumb and in advanced cartilaginous state.\r\nThe kidneys fair; the liver enlarged and badly congested.\r\n\r\nThe conditions exhibited were such that the wonder in any mind\r\npractised in the care of the human body lies in the thought that nature\r\nwas able to preserve under these handicaps this man's life until the\r\nforty-seventh year. To me this is proof positive that \"man does not\r\nlive by bread alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts given may easily be verified. Mr. Rader fasted because he\r\nhad to fast. He could not take food in any sort or in any manner, and\r\nhis death occurred because of organic disease beyond repair. He was\r\nnever without water and fruit juices; vegetable broths and prepared\r\nfoods were given whenever the occasion seemed to present itself, but\r\nalways with painful consequences. During the month of April he was\r\nvirtually fasting, although food was supplied as mentioned. It is not\r\nat all remarkable in my work to have patients abstain from food for\r\nthirty, forty, and fifty days, although by far the greater number do\r\nnot require this length of time.\r\n\r\nCriticized as I have been for my methods, and realizing that the\r\ncombined efforts of the old schools are aimed at what it eventually\r\nmeans, perhaps a definition may not prove amiss:\r\n\r\nStarvation consists in denying food, either by accident or design, to a\r\nsystem clamoring for sustenance.\r\n\r\nFasting consists in intentional abstinence from food by a system\r\nnon-desirous of sustenance until it is rested, cleansed, and ready for\r\nthe task of digestion. Food is then supplied.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the health and humane officers in the Rader case is not\r\nthe first instance of their methods of procedure that it has been my\r\nfate to experience. In the latter part of January, 1908, I had under my\r\ncare Mrs. D. D. Whedon, a young married woman in a critical state of\r\nhealth, mother of one child and about to become the mother of another.\r\nOfficious neighbors complained to the authorities that the child was\r\nbeing subjected to the fasting method and was slowly starving. Without\r\nwarrant these creatures of authority entered the apartments of Mrs.\r\nWhedon, subjected her to a bodily examination against her will and\r\nprotests, took her child from her by force, and when her husband\r\nattempted to regain possession of his daughter, they arrested him for\r\nresisting an officer and had him placed in the city jail. I also was\r\ncharged at this time with practising medicine without a license, an\r\naccusation that was quashed on appeal to the superior court.\r\n\r\nI rather court an investigation of my work and its results, successful\r\nand unsuccessful. Thus far the methods pursued by those antagonistic\r\nhave been the very ones that have succeeded in informing the world\r\nat large that the work is here, that it progresses, else why the\r\nfuror? It is here to stay and to do what the truth eventually always\r\ndoes--prevail.\r\n\r\nThe autopsies in each of the several deaths that have occurred in\r\nmy practice in the city of Seattle have exhibited organic disease,\r\nthe origin of which lay in the early years of life. In all of these\r\nbodies arrested development of one or other of the vital organs\r\nwas in evidence, and in the majority the injured intestines showed\r\ncartilaginous structure and deformation that must have required either\r\nviolent shock or continued functional disturbance to produce. In view\r\nof the fact that these instances cover subjects who had endeavored to\r\nfollow orthodox methods until orthodoxy proved unavailing, and who then\r\nturned to the fast and its accompaniments, I feel perfectly confident\r\nin declaring that early drug treatment is responsible for later and\r\nfatal disease. Nature had endowed each of these patients with strong\r\nvitality; each of them had suffered from severe functional disorder in\r\ninfancy; each had been drug-drenched.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there is no drug that is not a poison, stimulating\r\nor paralyzing in result, and in infancy the latter is doubly apparent\r\nand appalling. It needs but the parallelism between the effect of\r\nan application of a glass of brandy upon an infant and an adult to\r\nemphasize this statement. Consider then the consequences of repeated\r\ndosings for fevers, colic, colds, and the varied category of infantile\r\ndisease, and conceive the results upon tender, growing, human bodies.\r\nNot one of us but has these sacred relics of the days of powdered\r\ndried toads and desiccated cow manure to blame for organs arrested in\r\ndevelopment or functionally ruined.\r\n\r\nThe principle embodied in the intelligent application of fasting for\r\nthe cure of disease is not to be crushed by vilification. The knowledge\r\nof it, thanks to strenuous attacks by the medical profession, has\r\nbeen distributed gratis throughout the English-speaking world; and my\r\nown part in the work of propaganda has been made more than easy by\r\nopposition displayed. I believe that I have a cause to defend, a truth\r\nto uphold, a principle for which, if need be, I shall die fighting.\r\n\r\nLINDA BURFIELD HAZZARD.\r\n\r\nSEATTLE, WASH., May 16, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORACE FLETCHER'S FAST\r\n\r\nDec. 11, 1910.\r\n\r\nMR. HORACE FLETCHER,\r\nCare EDITOR OF _Good Health_,\r\nBATTLE CREEK, MICH.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. FLETCHER,--It must have been a year and a half ago that we\r\nhad our talk on the subject of fasting; you promised me that you would\r\ninvestigate it. I have only just seen the copy of the November _Good\r\nHealth_, and discovered that you carried out your promise. There are\r\nsome things in connection with your account about which I want to ask\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYou say that you have come to agree with Dr. Kellogg, that\r\nautointoxication continues during the fast; and that your reason\r\nfor this is that at the end of a couple of weeks you found yourself\r\ndeveloping weakness, bad breath, coated tongue, etc. You broke your\r\nfast because these symptoms grew worse and worse. Now surely if a\r\nperson is going to give a fair trial to the claims of the fasters,\r\nhe should follow their instructions, and he should not proceed in\r\nopposition to their most important advice. You say that for four days\r\nyou took no water, and that after that you took only a pint or so a\r\nday. In this you violated the leading injunction of every advocate of\r\nfasting with whose writings I am acquainted; I have read the books of\r\nBernarr Macfadden, C. C. Haskell, and Dr. L. B. Hazzard, all of whom\r\nhave treated scores and hundreds of patients by means of the fast, and\r\nall of whom are strenuous on the point that one should drink as much\r\nwater as possible. I myself while fasting have taken at least a glass\r\nevery hour. I believe that a very great deal of your trouble may have\r\nbeen caused by your procedure in this respect.\r\n\r\nAnother point which you do not mention is whether or not you took an\r\nenema during the fast. This is a very important point. It may very well\r\nbe true that poisons are excreted into the intestinal tract, and that\r\nowing to lack of food they are re-absorbed; if we can aid nature by\r\nwashing these poisons out at once, can we not overcome this difficulty?\r\nMay not the reason for the non-success of your fast lie here?\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the fast leads to constantly increasing\r\nautointoxication, how do you account for those phenomena which are\r\nsummed up in the phrase, \"the complete fast\"? I personally do not\r\nadvocate the complete fast; I only advocate the investigation of it.\r\nI have never taken one, but I have letters from many people who have\r\ntaken them, and they are in agreement upon the point that there comes a\r\ntime during the fast when the tongue clears, the breath becomes pure,\r\nand hunger manifests itself in unmistakable form. How can this possibly\r\nbe true if Dr. Kellogg's explanation of the symptoms of fasting is\r\ncorrect? Would it not happen just to the contrary, would not the\r\nsymptoms of autointoxication increase, until death through poisoning\r\nresulted?\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg's argument is a very plausible one; for many years it\r\nsufficed to keep me from trying the experiment of the fast. I know\r\nthat it has kept many other people. His claim is, in brief, that\r\nduring the fast the body is living off its own tissue; that we are\r\ntherefore meat-eaters, and even cannibals, while fasting. We are living\r\non a kind of food which is over-rich in proteid, and which generates\r\nexcessive quantities of uric acid, indican, etc. This, as I say, sounds\r\nplausible, but I found by actual experiment that the facts do not\r\nwork out according to the theory. I myself have taken a week's fast\r\nrecently, with perfect success. During this time I had not one particle\r\nof weakness or trouble of any sort. Perhaps it may be that my body was\r\nexcreting undue amounts of uric acid and indican, but I did not know\r\nit, and it did me no harm so far as I could discover. I am much less\r\nafraid of the consequences of living from my own body tissue, since I\r\nhave tried for myself the experiment of living on the tissues of other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nI am trying to get at the truth about these questions, and I know that\r\nyou are trying to do it also. For three years I did myself incalculable\r\nharm by accepting blindly statements that meat was the prime cause\r\nof autointoxication, together with other high proteid food. I lived\r\non starches and sugars, grew pale and thin and chilly, and, as I was\r\naccustomed to phrase it, was never more than fifteen minutes ahead of a\r\nheadache. I can give myself a headache at any time at present by two or\r\nthree days of eating rice, potatoes, white flour, and sugar. Apparently\r\nI cannot give it to myself by eating any possible quantity of broiled\r\nlean beef. So far as I can make out, beef is the one article of diet\r\nwhich never does me any harm, no matter how much of it I eat. The same\r\nthing is true, apparently, with my little boy.\r\n\r\nI wish you would tell me what you think about all this. I wish that I\r\ncould induce you to try the experiment of fasting again with the use of\r\nthe enema and the copious water drinking. Still more do I wish that you\r\ncould be induced to try it with some people who need it--some people\r\nwho are desperately ill, and who have not been able to get well by\r\nfollowing the low proteid diet.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nUPTON SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORWICH, CONN., U. S. A. Dec. 23, 1910.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SINCLAIR,--Your valued favor of the 14th inst. received\r\nenclosing copy of your letter to Horace Fletcher. I have read your\r\nletter to Mr. Fletcher with much interest, and I have also read Mr.\r\nFletcher's letter to Dr. Kellogg in _Good Health_.\r\n\r\nI am so crowded with work that I cannot take the time to write you on\r\nthis subject of Fasting as I would like. I have had nearly seventeen\r\nyears' experience studying and practising the \"no-breakfast plan and\r\nfasting for the cure of disease.\" I have followed the no-breakfast\r\nplan all that time without a single break, and I know it has been\r\nof exceedingly great value to me. It has also been my privilege and\r\npleasure to advise in thousands of cases covering nearly all forms of\r\ndisease, and where the Law of Fasting has been followed faithfully,\r\nthere have always been splendid results.\r\n\r\nAside from the omission of the breakfast, I have fasted a great\r\nmany times from one day to four weeks, and always the results have\r\nbeen beneficial. This could not have been the case if Dr. Kellogg's\r\ncontention is correct, that autointoxication continues and increases\r\nduring a fast. If his idea is correct on this point, instead of one\r\nimproving and at last overcoming the disease entirely, there would not\r\nonly be a continuation of the disease but an increase, and death would\r\nnaturally result. Should autointoxication continue and increase while\r\none is fasting, the time would not come when the tongue would be clean\r\nand natural hunger manifest itself. On the contrary, there would be an\r\nincrease of the coating on the tongue until death finally resulted.\r\n\r\nI think if Mr. Fletcher had continued his fast until his tongue had\r\nbecome clean, which certainly would be the case, he would have written\r\na very different letter. In the case of Mrs. Tarbox, whose letter\r\nI enclose, on the thirty-seventh day of her fast, her tongue was\r\nperfectly clean and she had natural hunger, and she was well on the way\r\nto recovery from the terrible cancerous growth and condition in which I\r\nfound her. Since Mrs. Tarbox' cure, I have had several other cases of\r\ncancer cured through fasting. You will note the case of Mrs. Hobson,\r\ncopy of whose letter I enclose, and the case of Mr. Davis is another\r\nvery interesting case as well as that of Mrs. Osborne. These persons\r\nwould not have been cured if autointoxication had been going on and\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\nDr. Dewey's contention I know to be true, that during a fast the heart,\r\nlungs, and brain are supported by the predigested food stored up in\r\nthe body. These organs take the nourishment and not the poison, for\r\nduring a fast the eliminating organs work to the very limit to force\r\nthe poison out of every cell of the body, so that during a fast all\r\nthe poison in the body is growing less every hour, and when it is all\r\neliminated natural hunger manifests itself, the tongue is clean, and\r\nthe patient is ready to build up and have a clean physical organism.\r\nThe use of the enema is exceedingly important during a fast. I believe\r\nthat it hastens the cure at least twenty-five per cent, and perhaps\r\nmore than that.\r\n\r\nMr. Fletcher's own letter is to my mind a refutation to Dr. Kellogg's\r\nclaim as to the continuation and increase of autointoxication, for he\r\ntells the benefits that he has received during his fast of seventeen\r\ndays, and those benefits would have been greatly increased if he had\r\ncontinued the fast until his tongue was clean. His sense of taste had\r\nbecome so refined by the fast that his food was more delicious than\r\never before, which showed that the refining process had been going on\r\nall through his body. Another benefit that he mentions is the lessening\r\nof his desire for sugar, that he is satisfied with the sugar sweet that\r\nis in the food itself, which is so much more healthful than the cane\r\nsugar. Another thing that he speaks of is the reduction in his weight,\r\nwhich he needed. I sincerely hope that Mr. Fletcher will fast again,\r\nand make it a complete fast, for I think he will have a very different\r\nstory to tell from what he tells in this letter.\r\n\r\nCHARLES COURTNEY HASKELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDec. 28, 1910.\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SINCLAIR,--I have your letter of the 14th inst. and its\r\nenclosures.\r\n\r\nTo those who have carefully and scientifically undergone or advised the\r\nfast, the cause of the symptoms that Dr. Kellogg and all of the rest of\r\nus recognize as indicating self-poisoning, is readily discovered to\r\nlie in the inability of the organs of elimination to promptly convey\r\nfrom the body the products of food supplied in excess of digestion.\r\nIt is a conclusion that cannot be escaped that, when the refuse from\r\nbroken-down tissue and from food ingested beyond the needs of the\r\nbody is discharged into the intestines, and when means of removal\r\nare not at hand, re-absorption at once begins and continues until\r\nthe canal is cleansed. Self-poisoning, autointoxication, ensues, and\r\nall of its symptoms were emphatically shown in the fast of seventeen\r\ndays that Mr. Fletcher essayed. These results are also often observed\r\nwhen feeding is in progress, and in this connection I refer to an\r\narticle written by Dr. Kellogg for _Good Health_ in the summer of\r\n1908. In it he says, \"The writer's observations, extending over a\r\nconsiderable number of years, have brought him to the conclusion that\r\nthe cases which are benefited by fasting are practically without\r\nexception cases of autointoxication, generally cases of intestinal\r\nautointoxication, though perhaps also including some cases of metabolic\r\nautointoxication.\" It seems to me that the Doctor has not made it quite\r\nclear just why, if the fast is the certain producer of the condition,\r\nhe recommends it for the cure of the condition. Perhaps \"similia\r\nsimilibus\" or \"the hair of the dog theory\" is implanted in the Doctor's\r\nego.\r\n\r\nAs we review the situation, covering in origin thousands and thousands\r\nof years of wrong living, the facts are patent. The processes of\r\ndigestion and assimilation as functions have long since lost natural\r\nexpression. Drugs and heredity have created in them an inability to\r\ncope with their work without assistance, and have in many instances\r\ncaused a positive cessation of normal action.\r\n\r\nDr. Kellogg would have us accept his dictum that the cause of loss of\r\nweight during the fast is to be found in the impoverished state of\r\nthe blood, and in the fact that, food being denied, no up-building of\r\ntissue can occur. Can he explain in this manner the wasting of tissue\r\nin illness when food is regularly supplied? It should be readily\r\nunderstood that, in either instance, the process of elimination of\r\ndecomposed excess food has at last become the predominant function of\r\nthe diseased system. Fasting is the voluntary act that permits rapid\r\naccomplishment of the result; and disease itself is but Nature's\r\nattempt to cleanse and purify by means of elimination. The longer\r\nthis thought is dwelt upon, and the more its details are verified by\r\nexperiment, the stronger becomes the conviction that we are facing the\r\ntruth of the matter.\r\n\r\nWhen coated tongue, foul breath, and vertigo appear, whether feeding or\r\nfasting, hunger is absent. It must have disappeared many days before\r\nthese signs became acute, although Nature's warnings did not fail of\r\ndisplay. The sensation of hunger, the desire for food for the purpose\r\nof restoring cell life, is the human body's greatest natural safeguard.\r\nA sentinel of lower rank is the sense of taste, which, however, like\r\nother outposts, often becomes debauched and valueless. But hunger never\r\ncan be turned from its protecting task, and it cannot be stimulated\r\ninto action. Hunger is the one natural function that is incorruptible,\r\nfor once abused it withdraws. Its deceptive counterpart, appetite, is\r\nthe product of taste-stimulation, and, as Mr. Fletcher says, takes upon\r\nitself the guise of habit. Or, as expressed in the text of my book,\r\n\"Appetite is craving; Hunger is desire. Craving is never satisfied;\r\nbut Desire is relieved when Want is supplied. Eating without Hunger\r\nor pandering to Appetite at the expense of Digestion makes Disease\r\ninevitable.\"\r\n\r\nHad real normal hunger been present when Mr. Fletcher broke his fast,\r\nthe demand for food would have been so great and so insistent that no\r\ndenial would have been tolerated. Mr. Fletcher states that he did not\r\nwant food until he had tasted it,--a clear case of taste-stimulation\r\nor appetite. Even this was momentary and was but the expiring flame\r\nof taste relish left after seventeen days free from the progressive\r\naccumulation of excess food. Despite his care in the selection and the\r\nmastication of his food, Mr. Fletcher must still have continually eaten\r\nwithout hunger, and must, as a result, have stored within his system an\r\nunusual amount of material beyond the needs of his body. Had this not\r\nbeen true, he would not have exhibited the coated tongue, foul breath,\r\nand vertigo. Hunger would have been ever present, and it would have\r\nbeen impossible for him to fast.\r\n\r\nMy only comment upon the neglect of the enema that seems to have\r\noccurred in the conduct of Mr. Fletcher's fast is that it was a most\r\nvital error. The enema is absolutely necessary. The question of diet\r\nalso need not be discussed, for experience shows that the feeding of\r\nthe body is a matter of individual requirement. If normal physical\r\nbalance be ever reached, fixed laws to govern the diet problem could be\r\nformulated. In its present state, argument resolves itself into mere\r\nutterances of individual opinion and prejudice.\r\n\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\nLINDA BURFIELD HAZZARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Transcriber's note:                              |\r\n|                                                 |\r\n|Obvious typographic errors have been corrected.  |\r\n|                                                 |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------+",
