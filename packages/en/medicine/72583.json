The design, then, of the present Work,[1]\r\nis to give a translation of all the genuine remains of the GREAT\r\nHIPPOCRATES, along with such an amount of illustration as may be\r\nsufficient to render them intelligible to any well-educated member\r\nof the profession at the present day. It was understood, indeed,\r\nwhen I first engaged in this undertaking, that I was merely to give\r\na faithful translation of the original; but I soon became satisfied,\r\nthat a considerable amount of illustration, in the form of Annotations,\r\nArguments, and so forth, would be indispensable to the general utility\r\nof such a publication. It is well known that many parts of my author’s\r\nworks are very obscure, owing to the conciseness of the language,\r\nand the difficulty which now exists of properly apprehending the\r\nviews entertained on certain abstruse questions at so very distant\r\na period; and, consequently, it will readily be understood, that a\r\nsimple version, without either comment or illustration, would have\r\nbeen nearly as unintelligible to most of my readers as the original\r\nitself. And that the works of Hippocrates stand in need of illustration\r\nis rendered apparent from the number of commentaries which have been\r\nwritten upon them in all ages, commencing almost with his own time.\r\nBut whether or not I have been fortunate enough to give just such an\r\namount of illustration as was necessary, and have taken proper care at\r\nthe same time not to load my pages with superfluous matters of this\r\ndescription, must be left to the judgment of my readers to determine.\r\nHowever, I may be permitted to say, that whatever value shall be put\r\nupon my performances in this line, I have certainly spared no pains\r\nto make myself well acquainted with the true doctrines of my author,\r\nand that for this purpose I have consulted all the best authorities to\r\nwhich I could obtain access, from the commentaries of Apollonius and\r\nGalen down to the learned labors of several continental scholars, my\r\ncontemporaries, especially Dr. Ermerins, of Holland, and MM. Littré and\r\nMalgaigne, of France. I flatter myself it will also be admitted, that I\r\nhave further collected from a variety of sources, a considerable store\r\nof valuable material, for which I am in nowise indebted to any of my\r\npredecessors in the same field of research.\r\n\r\nConsidering how scanty all the information is which the English\r\nlanguage can supply on many questions connected with the medical\r\nliterature of the ancients, I have judged it necessary to enter into a\r\ndiscussion of several of those subjects, in order to prepare my readers\r\nfor understanding the doctrines of my author. These are contained in\r\nthe Preliminary Discourse, and will be found to relate principally to\r\nthe origin of Grecian Medicine, to the Biography of Hippocrates, and\r\nan analysis of the works which bear his name, and to an exposition\r\nof the principles of the Physical Philosophy which form the basis of\r\nmost of the hypotheses which occur in the Hippocratic Collection.\r\nHaving bestowed much pains on the illustration of the philosophical\r\ntenets of the ancients, I shall feel anxious to learn how far the\r\njudgment pronounced by me on various controverted points is approved\r\nof by persons possessing the necessary degree of information to enable\r\nthem to form a correct estimate of them, along with a proper degree\r\nof candor in judging between the conventional opinions of the present\r\ntime, and those which prevailed in so remote an age.\r\n\r\nThat I have imposed upon myself a very serious additional task, by\r\nengaging not only to give a true version of the language of my author,\r\nbut also to expound his opinions, and place them, so to speak, in\r\njuxtaposition with those of the present age, will be readily admitted;\r\nand I have reason perhaps to apprehend, that I have thereby exposed\r\nmyself to the strictures of a certain class of critics, who have formed\r\nto themselves a very different ideal of the duties of a translator,\r\nfancying that he ought merely to concern himself with the words of the\r\noriginal author, and not venture to sit in judgment on the doctrines.\r\nI shall not attempt, however, any formal defense of the method which\r\nI have pursued, but may be allowed to remark, that, if I shall be\r\nfound to have failed in satisfying the reasonable expectations of such\r\nreaders as are sincerely desirous of becoming familiarly acquainted\r\nwith the opinions of an author, whom I verily believe to be the highest\r\nexemplar of professional excellence which the world has ever seen, it\r\nis not from want of zeal in the discharge of the arduous duties which I\r\nhad undertaken.\r\n\r\nI have little left to say in this place respecting most of the critical\r\nsubjects connected with the work, as I have entered at considerable\r\nlength into the discussion of these matters in the Preliminary\r\nDiscourse. It is proper, however, to acknowledge that I have derived\r\ngreat assistance from M. Littré’s excellent edition, of which the\r\nparts already published embrace all the treatises here given, with the\r\nexception of the last four. On all occasions I have freely availed\r\nmyself of his labors, more especially in amending the text, in which\r\nrespect his edition undoubtedly surpasses all those which preceded\r\nit. I have also not neglected to consult all the other standard\r\neditions, especially those of Foës, Van der Linden, and Kühn, and\r\nlikewise, as will be seen, many other editions of separate treatises,\r\nso that, altogether, I trust it will be found that I have not often\r\nfailed in attaining the true meaning of my author, as far as it can\r\nnow be ascertained. I am aware, indeed, that, situated as I am, at a\r\ndistance from public libraries, and deprived of personal intercourse\r\nwith learned men of congenial pursuits whom I could consult in cases\r\nwhere I felt myself in doubt, I have labored under disadvantages which\r\nmay render my work not so perfect in all respects as could have been\r\nwished; and that, by sending it to the press as soon as completed, it\r\nis not unlikely I may have left it disfigured by certain blemishes\r\nwhich _multa dies et multa litura_ might have enabled me to remove.\r\nBut the urgency of my other professional and private concerns forbade\r\nme to devote much longer time to any one task, however interesting or\r\nimportant; while the weight of increasing years, and the confirmed\r\nconviction of the endless nature of literary research on such a subject\r\nas this, disposed me, on the present occasion, to keep in mind the\r\nsolemn admonition of my Author, that “Life is short, and Art is long.”\r\n\r\n                                                               F.

Their great\r\nexcellence has been acknowledged in all ages, and it has always been a\r\nquestion which has naturally excited literary curiosity, by what steps\r\nthe art had attained to such perfection at so early a period. This\r\ninvestigation, however, is attended with peculiar difficulties, and\r\nhas never been marked by any very satisfactory results. At one time,\r\nindeed, it was usual to solve the question by supposing that Greece\r\nhad derived all the arts and sciences, in a state of considerable\r\nadvancement, from the oriental nations, who are admitted to have\r\npossessed a considerable degree of civilization before the Hellenic\r\nrace became distinguished for intellectual development.[2] The question\r\nwith regard to the origin of Medicine was thus supposed to have met\r\nwith a satisfactory solution. For, it being generally admitted that the\r\nHippocratic Medicine had emerged from the schools of philosophy, and it\r\nhaving been assumed as incontrovertible that the early philosophy of\r\nthe Greeks had been derived from the East, the inference appeared to be\r\nquite legitimate that medicine, in a state of considerable advancement,\r\nhad been imported from the same quarter. Recent research, however, has\r\ncast great doubts on the supposed descent of Grecian philosophy from\r\na foreign source, and it is now pretty generally admitted that the\r\nOrientals, in early times, had never made any considerable progress in\r\nmental science.[3] Instead, then, of looking upon philosophy as having\r\nbeen an exotic production in the land of Hellas, we have every reason\r\nto believe that it was, what its inhabitants, in the noble pride of\r\npolitical freedom and intellectual superiority, boasted that their\r\nforefathers had been, namely, “the offspring of their own soil.”[4]\r\nSince the philosophy of the Greeks was indigenous, there is every\r\nreason to suppose that their medicine was so in like manner. How long\r\nthe union between medicine and philosophy had subsisted before the time\r\nof Hippocrates, has not been determined upon any contemporary evidence,\r\nbut the disciples of Pythagoras, in after ages, did not hesitate to\r\nascribe to him the honor of effecting this alliance.[5] However this\r\nmay be, it appears to me very doubtful whether these philosophers ever\r\npractised medicine as a craft. Indeed, it is much more likely that they\r\nmerely speculated upon the phenomena of disease. Thus we shall see\r\nafterwards, that Plato himself did not discard speculative medicine\r\nfrom his system of philosophy, although we are quite sure that he\r\nnever practised it as an art. But this connection between medicine and\r\nphilosophy was by no means regarded, in after times, as having been\r\nfavorable to the advancement of the former, for we find Hippocrates\r\ncomplimented by Celsus for having brought about a separation between\r\nthem.[6]\r\n\r\nIt is clearly established that, long before the birth of philosophy,\r\nmedicine had been zealously and successfully cultivated by the\r\nAsclepiadæ, an order of priest-physicians that traced its origin to\r\na mythical personage bearing the distinguished name of Æsculapius.\r\nTwo of his sons, Podalirius and Machaon, figure in the Homeric poems,\r\nnot however as priests, but as warriors possessed of surgical skill\r\nin the treatment of wounds, for which they are highly complimented by\r\nthe poet. It was probably some generations after this time (if one may\r\nventure a conjecture on a matter partaking very much of the legendary\r\ncharacter) that Æsculapius was deified, and that Temples of Health,\r\ncalled _Asclepia_, presided over by the Asclepiadæ, were erected\r\nin various parts of Greece, as receptacles for the sick, to which\r\ninvalids resorted in those days for the cure of diseases, under the\r\nsame circumstances as they go to hospitals and spas at the present\r\ntime. What remedial measures were adopted in these temples we have no\r\nmeans of ascertaining so fully as could be wished, but the following\r\nfacts, collected from a variety of sources, may be pretty confidently\r\nrelied upon for their accuracy. In the first place, then, it is well\r\nascertained that a large proportion of these temples were built in\r\nthe vicinity of thermæ, or medicinal springs, the virtues of which\r\nwould no doubt contribute greatly to the cure of the sick.[7] At his\r\nentrance into the temple, the devotee was subjected to purifications,\r\nand made to go through a regular course of bathing, accompanied with\r\nmethodical frictions, resembling the oriental system now well known\r\nby the name of _shampooing_. Fomentations with decoctions of\r\nodoriferous herbs were also not forgotten. A total abstinence from food\r\nwas at first prescribed,[8] but afterwards the patient would no doubt\r\nbe permitted to partake of the flesh of the animals which were brought\r\nto the temples as sacrifices. Every means that could be thought of was\r\nused for working upon the imagination of the sick, such as religious\r\nceremonies of an imposing nature, accompanied by music, and whatever\r\nelse could arouse their senses, conciliate their confidence, and in\r\ncertain cases, contribute to their amusement.[9] In addition to these\r\nmeans, it is believed by many intelligent Mesmerists of the present\r\nday, that the aid of Animal magnetism was called in to contribute to\r\nthe cure;[10] but on this point the proof is not so complete as could\r\nbe wished. Certain it is, however, that as the Mesmerists administer\r\nmedicines which are suggested to the imagination of patients during the\r\nstate of clairvoyance, the Asclepiadæ prescribed drugs as indicated in\r\ndreams. These, indeed, were generally of a very inert description; but\r\nsometimes medicines of a more dangerous nature, such as hemlock and\r\ngypsum, were used in this way,[11] and regular reports of the effects\r\nwhich they produced were kept by the priests in the temples. It is\r\nalso well known that the Asclepiadæ noted down with great care the\r\nsymptoms and issue of every case, and that, from such observations,\r\nthey became in time great adepts in the art of prognosis. When we come\r\nto an analysis of the different Hippocratic treatises, it will be seen\r\nthat there is strong reason to believe we are still possessed of two\r\ndocuments composed from the results of observations made in the ancient\r\nTemples of Health. It would also contribute much to the increase of\r\nmedical knowledge in this way, that the office of priesthood was\r\nhereditary in certain families, so that information thus acquired\r\nwould be transmitted from father to son, and go on accumulating\r\nfrom one generation to another.[12] Whether the Asclepiadæ availed\r\nthemselves of the great opportunities which they must undoubtedly\r\nhave had of cultivating human and comparative anatomy, has been much\r\ndisputed in modern times; indeed, the contrary is expressly maintained\r\nby some eminent authorities, such as Gruner[13] and Sprengel.[14]\r\nBut it will be shown in another place, that there is good reason for\r\nbelieving that these two scholars have greatly underrated the amount\r\nof anatomical knowledge possessed by Hippocrates, and his predecessors\r\nthe priest-physicians in the Temples of Health. Moreover, it is worthy\r\nof remark, that Galen holds Hippocrates to have been a very successful\r\ncultivator of anatomy.[15] Galen further states, upon the authority of\r\nPlato,[16] that the Asclepiadæ paid no attention to dietetics; but this\r\nopinion would require to be received with considerable modification,\r\nfor, most assuredly, whoever reflects on the great amount of valuable\r\ninformation on this subject which is contained in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises, will not readily bring himself to believe that it could have\r\nbeen all collected by one man, or in the course of one generation. It\r\nis worthy of remark, moreover, that Strabo, whose authority I need\r\nscarcely say stands deservedly high in all literary matters, does not\r\nhesitate to affirm that Hippocrates was trained in the knowledge of\r\ndietetics, from documents preserved in the Asclepion of Cos.[17] That\r\ngymnastics, as stated by Galen,[18] wire not recognized as a regular\r\nbranch of the healing art, until the age of Hippocrates, is indeed\r\nnot improbable, and this perhaps is what Plato meant when he says\r\nthat the Asclepiadæ did not make any use of the pedagogic art until\r\nit was introduced by Herodicus. But at the same time there can be no\r\ndoubt, as further stated by Galen,[19] that exercise, and especially\r\nriding on horseback, constituted _one_ of the measures used by\r\nthe Asclepiadæ for the recovery of health, having been introduced by\r\nÆsculapius himself.\r\n\r\nOf the _Asclepia_ we have mentioned above, it will naturally be\r\nsupposed that some were in much higher repute than others, either from\r\nbeing possessed of peculiar advantages, or from the prevalence of\r\nfashion. In the beginning of the fifth century before the Christian\r\nera, the temples of Rhodes, Cnidos, and Cos were held in especial\r\nfavor, and on the extinction of the first of these, another rose up in\r\nItaly in its stead.[20] But the temple of Cos was destined to throw the\r\nreputation of all the others into the background, by producing among\r\nthe priests of Æsculapius the individual who, in all after ages, has\r\nbeen distinguished by the name of the GREAT HIPPOCRATES.[21]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding, however, to give a brief sketch of his biography, I\r\nmay state, partly by way of recapitulation, and partly in anticipation\r\nof what will be found in a subsequent part of this work, the leading\r\nfacts which are known relative to the state of medicine before his time.\r\n\r\n1. The origin of Grecian medicine is involved in impenetrable darkness,\r\nbeing anterior to all authentic history, and nothing being known either\r\nas to its rise or the steps by which it grow up to be a regular art.\r\n\r\n2. There is no reason to suppose that the germs of medical science, any\r\nmore than those of philosophy, had been originally imported into Greece\r\nfrom the East.\r\n\r\n3. The earliest practitioners of medicine concerning whom we have any\r\nauthentic information, were the Asclepiadæ, or priest-physicians, who\r\nendeavored to cure the sick partly by superstitious modes of working\r\nupon the imagination, and partly by more rational means, suggested by\r\nobservation and a patient study of the phenomena of disease.\r\n\r\n4. Though the men of letters who directed their attention to the\r\nphenomena of disease, as constituting a branch of philosophy, may in\r\nso far have improved the theory of medicine by freeing it from the\r\ntrammels of superstition, it is not likely they could have contributed\r\nmuch to the practice of medicine, which is well known to be founded on\r\nobservation and experience.\r\n\r\n5. Though there can be little or no doubt that the priest-physicians,\r\nand the philosophers together, were possessed of all the knowledge of\r\nmedicine which had been acquired at that time, it is not satisfactorily\r\nascertained by what means the art had attained that remarkable degree\r\nof perfection which we shall soon see that it exhibited in the hands of\r\nHippocrates. But I must now proceed with my Sketch of his Life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat Hippocrates was lineally descended from Æsculapius was generally\r\nadmitted by his countrymen, and a genealogical table, professing to\r\ngive a list of the names of his forefathers, up to Æsculapius, has\r\nbeen transmitted to us from remote antiquity. Although I am well aware\r\nthat but little reliance can be put on these mythical genealogies, I\r\nwill subjoin the list to this section, in order that it may be at hand\r\nfor reference, as many allusions will have to be made to it in the\r\nsubsequent pages.[22]\r\n\r\nOf the circumstances connected with the life of Hippocrates little\r\nis known for certain, the only biographies which we have of him being\r\nall of comparatively recent date, and of little authority. They are\r\nthree in number, and bear the names of Soranus Ephesins, Suidas, and\r\nTzetzes. Of the age in which the first of these authors flourished,\r\nnothing is known for certain; the second is a lexicographer, who lived\r\nin the beginning of the eleventh century; and the third flourished\r\nin the twelfth century. The birth of Hippocrates is generally fixed,\r\nupon the authority of Soranus, as having occurred in the first year\r\nof the 80th Olympiad, that is to say, in the 460th year before the\r\nvulgar era. On this point, however, I must say that I see no good\r\ngrounds for the unanimity of opinion which has generally prevailed\r\namong modern scholars. In fact, the counter-evidence of Aulus Gellius\r\nhas always appeared to me to be unjustly overlooked, as I cannot\r\nbut think that his authority ought to rank much higher than that of\r\nSoranus, of whom nothing is known, not even the century in which he\r\nlived. Aulus Gellius, then, in an elaborate disquisition on Greek and\r\nRoman chronology, states decidedly that Socrates was contemporary with\r\nHippocrates, but younger than he.[23] Now it is well ascertained, that\r\nthe death of Socrates took place about the year 400 A.C., and\r\nas he was then nearly seventy years old, his birth must be dated as\r\nhappening about the year 470 A.C. This statement would throw\r\nthe birth of Hippocrates back several years beyond the common date,\r\nas given by Soranus. There is also much uncertainty as to the time\r\nof his death: according to one tradition he died at the age of 85,\r\nwhereas others raise it to 90, 104, and even 109 years. These dates\r\nof his birth and death, although vague, are sufficient to show that\r\nthe period at which we may reasonably suppose he had practised his\r\nprofession with the greatest activity and reputation, must have been\r\nthe latter part of the fifth century A.C. It will readily\r\noccur to the reader, then, that our author flourished at one of the\r\nmost memorable epochs in the intellectual development of the human\r\nrace. He had for his contemporaries, Pericles, the famous statesman;\r\nthe poets Æschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Pindar;\r\nthe philosopher Socrates, with his distinguished disciples Plato\r\nand Xenophon; the venerable father of history, Herodotus, and his\r\nyoung rival, Thucydides; the unrivalled statuary, Phidias, with his\r\nillustrious pupils, and many other distinguished names, which have\r\nconferred immortal honor on the age in which they lived, and exalted\r\nthe dignity of human nature. Nor was Greece the only region of the\r\nearth remarkable at this time for moral and intellectual improvement;\r\nfor, if we may believe oriental chronology, Confucius and Zoroaster had\r\ngone off the stage of life only a very few years before the dawn of\r\nthis celebrated age of Grecian superiority in the arts and sciences.\r\nHippocrates, it thus appears, came into the world under circumstances\r\nwhich must have co-operated with his own remarkable powers of intellect\r\nin raising him to that extraordinary eminence which his name has\r\nattained in all ages. From his forefathers he inherited a distinguished\r\nsituation in one of the most eminent hospitals, or Temples of Health,\r\nthen in existence, where he must have enjoyed free access to all the\r\ntreasures of observations collected during many generations, and at\r\nthe same time would have an opportunity of assisting his own father in\r\nthe management of the sick.[24] Thus from his youth he must have been\r\nfamiliar with the principles of medicine, both in the abstract and in\r\nthe concrete,--the greatest advantage, I may be permitted to remark,\r\nwhich any tyro in the healing art can possibly enjoy. In addition to\r\nall this, he had excellent opportunities of estimating the good and\r\nbad effects resulting from the application of gymnastic exercises in\r\nthe cure of diseases, under the tuition of Herodicus, the first person\r\nwho is known for certain to have cultivated this art as a branch of\r\nmedicine.[25] He was further instructed in the polite literature and\r\nphilosophy of the age, by two men of classical celebrity, Gorgias\r\nand Democritus; the latter of whom is well known to have devoted\r\nmuch attention to the study of medicine, and its cognate sciences,\r\ncomparative anatomy and physiology.\r\n\r\nInitiated in the theory and first principles of medicine, as now\r\ndescribed, Hippocrates no doubt commenced the practice of his art in\r\nthe Asclepion of Cos, as his forefathers had done before him. Why he\r\nafterwards left the place of his nativity, and visited distant regions\r\nof the earth, whither the duties of his profession and the calls of\r\nhumanity invited him, cannot now be satisfactorily determined. The\r\nrespect paid to him in his lifetime by the good and wise in all the\r\ncountries which he visited, and the veneration in which his memory\r\nhas been held by all subsequent generations, are more than sufficient\r\nto confute the base calumny, invented, no doubt, by some envious\r\nrival, that he was obliged to flee from the land of his nativity in\r\nconsequence of his having set fire to the library attached to the\r\nTemple of Health, at Cnidos, in order that he might enjoy a monopoly\r\nof the knowledge which he had extracted from the records which it had\r\ncontained.[26] Certain it is, that he afterwards visited Thrace, Delos,\r\nThessaly, Athens, and many other regions, and that he practised, and\r\nprobably taught, his profession in all these places.[27] There are many\r\ntraditions of what he did during his long life, but with regard to\r\nthe truth of them, the greatest diversity of opinion has prevailed in\r\nmodern times. Thus he is said to have cured Perdiccas, the Macedonian\r\nking, of love-sickness; and although there are circumstances connected\r\nwith this story which give it an air of improbability, it is by no\r\nmeans unlikely that he may have devoted his professional services to\r\nthe court of Macedonia, since very many of the places mentioned in\r\nhis works as having been visited by him, such as Pella and Acanthus,\r\nare situated in that country; and further, in confirmation of the\r\nnarrative, it deserves to be mentioned, that there is most satisfactory\r\nevidence of his son Thessalus having been court physician to Archelaus,\r\nking of Macedonia;[28] and it is well ascertained that another of his\r\ndescendants, the Fourth Hippocrates, attended Roxane, the queen of\r\nAlexander the Great.[29] Our author’s name is also connected with the\r\ngreat plague of Athens, the contagion of which he is reported to have\r\nextinguished there and in other places, by kindling fires.[30] The only\r\nserious objection to the truth of this story is the want of proper\r\ncontemporary evidence in support of it. It is no sufficient objection,\r\nhowever, that Thucydides, in his description of the circumstances\r\nattending the outbreak of the pestilence in Attica, makes no mention\r\nof any services having been rendered to the community by Hippocrates;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, he states decidedly that the skill of the\r\nphysicians could do nothing to mitigate the severity of this malady.\r\nIt is highly probable, that, if Hippocrates was actually called upon\r\nto administer professional assistance in this way, it must have been\r\nduring one of the subsequent attacks or exacerbations of the disease\r\nwhich occurred some years afterwards. We know that this plague did\r\nnot expend its fury in Greece during one season, and then was no more\r\nheard of; but on the contrary, we learn that it continued to lurk\r\nabout in Athens and elsewhere, and sometimes broke out anew with all\r\nits original severity. Thucydides briefly mentions a second attack of\r\nthe plague at Athens about two years after the first,[31] attended\r\nwith a frightful degree of mortality; nor is it at all improbable\r\nthat this was not the last visitation of the malady. Though the\r\nname of Hippocrates, then, may not have been heard of at its first\r\ninvasion, it is not at all unlikely that, after he had risen to the\r\nhead of his profession in Greece, as we know that he subsequently\r\ndid, he should have been publicly consulted regarding the treatment\r\nof the most formidable disease which was prevailing at the time.[32]\r\nWhat adds an appearance of truth to the tale is, that several of the\r\ngenuine works of Hippocrates, which were probably published in its\r\nlifetime, relate to the causes and treatment of epidemic and endemic\r\ndiseases.[33] That the magistrates of Athens, then, should have applied\r\nto him as the most eminent authority on the subject, to assist them\r\nin their sanitary regulations[34] during the prevalence of this great\r\npestilence, is so far from being improbable, that I think it would have\r\nbeen very extraordinary if they had omitted to consult him, seeing that\r\nhe was undoubtedly looked up to as the _facile princeps_ among\r\nthe physicians of the day. That his services in this way have been\r\nexaggerated by the blind admiration of his worshipers, both at that\r\ntime and in after ages, may be readily admitted; but this circumstance\r\nought not to make us reject the whole story as being fabulous. I\r\nrepeat, then, that although this part of the history of Hippocrates\r\nbe not vouched by any contemporary evidence, it is by no means devoid\r\nof probability, while the objections which have been started to it by\r\nmodern authorities have not so much weight as is generally supposed.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance in the life of Hippocrates, for the truth of\r\nwhich Soranus, Suidas, and a host of ancient authorities concur\r\nin vouching, namely, that he refused a formal invitation to pay a\r\nprofessional visit to the court of Persia, is rejected with disdain\r\nby almost all the modern scholars who have touched upon this subject.\r\nBut was it an uncommon thing for the king of Persia to manœuvre in\r\nthis way with Grecian talent in order to attract it to his court? So\r\nfar is the contrary known to be the case that, as every person who\r\nis familiar with the early history of Greece must be well aware, the\r\nmanner in which “the Great King” rendered himself most formidable to\r\nthe Grecian Republics after the humiliating defeats which the military\r\nforces of Persia had sustained at Marathon, Salamis, and Platæa, was\r\nby intriguing with all those distinguished persons in Greece who would\r\nrender themselves accessible to his bribes and flatteries, and thus\r\nendeavoring to detach them from the cause of their country. Of this\r\nwe have notable examples in the case of two illustrious individuals,\r\nwho were nearly contemporary with Hippocrates--I mean Pausanias and\r\nThemistocles. Moreover, it is well known that Grecian physicians at\r\nall times were in high repute at the court of Babylon;[35] witness\r\nCtesias, the contemporary and kinsman of Hippocrates,[36] who was court\r\nphysician to the king of Persia, and was employed in that capacity in\r\nthe most serious emergencies.[37] What more natural, then, or more\r\nlikely to happen, than that the king of Persia, when he saw his country\r\noverrun by the plague,[38] should seek advice from a neighboring\r\npeople, whose superiority to his own subjects in all the arts of war\r\nand peace he and his predecessors had learned from sad experience? I\r\nreadily admit that the letters in the Hippocratic Collection which\r\nrelate to this story can scarcely be received as genuine; but does this\r\nprove that the event upon which they are made to turn is also devoid\r\nof truth? I can see no probability in this supposition; for whether\r\nwe regard these documents as willful forgeries, executed with the\r\nfraudulent intention of palming them on the literary world as genuine\r\nproductions, or whether we look upon them as mere exercises made on\r\ngiven subjects by the Sophists or Scholiasts to display their ability\r\nin sustaining an assumed character, it would have been preposterous\r\nto make them relate to stories of which every person of that age must\r\nhave been able to detect the falsehood. Were any person at the present\r\nday, from whatever motive, desirous of palming upon the public certain\r\nletters said to have been written by the celebrated John Hunter, he\r\nwould surely not be so imprudent as to endeavor to pass off as genuine\r\na correspondence purporting to have taken place between him and the\r\nking of France, as every one at all acquainted with professional\r\nbiography, would at once perceive that the authenticity of the\r\ndocuments in question was completely disproved by the falsity of the\r\nnarrative upon which they are founded. Seeing, then, that these letters\r\nare admitted on all hands to be very ancient, that is to say, of a date\r\nnot much later than the time of Hippocrates, we may rest assured that\r\nthe main facts to which they allude were believed at the time to be of\r\nan authentic nature.\r\n\r\nFor the like reasons I am disposed to think that, although the letters\r\nin the Collection which refer to a pretended correspondence between him\r\nand Democritus are most probably to be regarded as spurious, it is far\r\nfrom being improbable that the physician may have rendered the services\r\nof his profession to the philosopher. Had there been no grounds\r\nwhatever for this story, why so many ancient authors should have agreed\r\nin giving credit to it I cannot imagine.\r\n\r\nAccording to all the accounts which have come down to us of his life,\r\nhe spent the latter part of it in Thessaly, and died at Larissa, when\r\nfar advanced in years. The corruptions with regard to numbers which,\r\nin the course of transcription, have crept into all works of great\r\nantiquity, sufficiently account for the differences already mentioned\r\nin the statements respecting his age at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nThese are all the particulars of any importance which can now be\r\ngathered regarding the life of him who has been venerated in all\r\nages as “The Father of Medicine.” That they are scanty and rather\r\nunsatisfactory, must be admitted; but yet what more, in general, can we\r\ndesire to know respecting the biography of a physician than the manner\r\nin which he was educated, how he was esteemed by his contemporaries,\r\nand what he did and wrote to reflect credit on his profession? The\r\napprobation and gratitude of those who have consulted him for the cure\r\nof their maladies are the best testimony to the public character of a\r\nphysician, and the estimation in which his writings are held by the\r\nmembers of his own profession is what constitutes his professional\r\nreputation. I need scarcely say that, as a medical author, the name\r\nof Hippocrates stands pre-eminently illustrious. In this way he has\r\nleft monuments of his genius more durable than the marble statues\r\nof Phidias, his contemporary, and as enduring as the tragedies of\r\nSophocles, or the Olympian odes of Pindar.\r\n\r\nIn the next section I intend to give a careful analysis of all\r\nthe writings which have come down to us from antiquity under\r\nthe name of Hippocrates, and to state clearly the grounds upon\r\nwhich some are to be received as genuine, and others rejected as\r\nsupposititious. I shall conclude the present section, although it\r\nmay appear that I am anticipating some things which had better have\r\ncome after the succeeding one, with a brief account of our author’s\r\ngeneral principles, both as regards the theory and the practice of\r\nmedicine; and in doing this I mean not to confine myself strictly\r\nto the treatises which are acknowledged to be genuine, as they are\r\nunfortunately so few in number, that we are often obliged to guess at\r\nthe tenets of our author from those held by his immediate successors\r\nand disciples.\r\n\r\nThe opinions which he held as to the origin of medicine, and the\r\nnecessities in human life which gave rise to it, are such as bespeak\r\nthe soundness of his views, and the eminently practical bent of his\r\ngenius. It was the necessity, he says,[39] which men in the first\r\nstages of society must have felt of ascertaining the properties of\r\nvegetable productions as articles of food that gave rise to the science\r\nof Dietetics; and the discovery having been made that the same system\r\nof regimen does not apply in a disordered as in a healthy condition of\r\nthe body, men felt themselves compelled to study what changes of the\r\naliment are proper in disease; and it was the accumulation of facts\r\nbearing on this subject which gave rise to the art of Medicine. Looking\r\nupon the animal system as one whole, every part of which conspires and\r\nsympathizes with all the other parts, he would appear to have regarded\r\ndisease also as one, and to have referred all its modifications to\r\npeculiarities of situation.[40] Whatever may now be thought of his\r\ngeneral views on Pathology, all must admit that his mode of prosecuting\r\nthe cultivation of medicine is in the true spirit of the Inductive\r\nPhilosophy; all his descriptions of disease are evidently derived from\r\npatient observation of its phenomena, and all his rules of practice are\r\nclearly based on experience. Of the fallaciousness of experience by\r\nitself he was well aware, however, and has embodied this great truth in\r\na memorable aphorism,[41] and therefore he never exempts the apparent\r\nresults of experience from the strict scrutiny of reason. Above all\r\nothers, Hippocrates was strictly the physician of experience and common\r\nsense. In short, the basis of his system was a rational experience, and\r\nnot a blind empiricism, so that the Empirics in after ages had no good\r\ngrounds for claiming him as belonging to their sect.[42]\r\n\r\nWhat he appears to have studied with particular attention is the\r\nnatural history of diseases, that is to say, their tendencies to a\r\nfavorable or fatal issue; and without this knowledge, what can all\r\nmedical practice be but blind empiricism?--a haphazard experiment,\r\nwhich perchance may turn out either to cure or to kill the patient?\r\nIn a word, let me take this opportunity of saying, that the physician\r\nwho cannot inform his patient what would be the probable issue of his\r\ncomplaint, if allowed to follow its natural course, is not qualified to\r\nprescribe any rational plan of treatment for its cure.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguishing characteristics, then, of the\r\nHippocratic system of medicine, is the importance attached in it to\r\n_prognosis_, under which was comprehended a complete acquaintance\r\nwith the previous and present condition of the patient, and the\r\ntendency of the disease. To the overstrained system of Diagnosis\r\npractised in the school of Cnidos, agreeably to which diseases were\r\ndivided and subdivided arbitrarily into endless varieties, Hippocrates\r\nwas decidedly opposed; his own strong sense and high intellectual\r\ncultivation having, no doubt, led him to the discovery, that to\r\naccidental varieties of diseased action there is no limit, and that\r\nwhat is indefinite cannot be reduced to science.[43]\r\n\r\nNothing strikes one as a stronger proof of his nobility of soul, when\r\nwe take into account the early period in human cultivation at which he\r\nlived, and his descent from a priestly order, than the contempt which\r\nhe everywhere expresses for ostentatious charlatanry, and his perfect\r\nfreedom from all popular superstition.[44] Of amulets and complicated\r\nmachines to impose on the credulity of the ignorant multitude, there\r\nis no mention in any part of his works. All diseases he traces to\r\nnatural causes, and counts it impiety to maintain that any one more\r\nthan another is an infliction from the Divinity. How strikingly the\r\nHippocratic system differs from that of all other nations in their\r\ninfantine state must be well known to every person who is well\r\nacquainted with the early history of medicine.[45] His theory of\r\nmedicine was further based on the physical philosophy of the ancients,\r\nmore especially on the doctrines then held regarding the elements of\r\nthings, and the belief in the existence of a spiritual essence diffused\r\nthrough the whole works of creation, which was regarded as the agent\r\nthat presides over the acts of generation, and which constantly strives\r\nto preserve all things in their natural state, and to restore them\r\nwhen they are preternaturally deranged. This is the principle which\r\nhe called Nature, and which he held to be a _vis medicatrix_.\r\n“Nature,” says he, or at least one of his immediate followers says, “is\r\nthe physician of diseases.”[46] His physical opinions are so important,\r\nthat I have resolved to devote an entire section to an exposition of\r\nthe ancient doctrines on this head. (See Sect. III.)\r\n\r\nThough his belief in this restorative principle would naturally\r\ndispose him to watch its operations carefully, and make him cautious\r\nnot to do anything that would interfere with their tendencies to\r\nrectify deranged actions, and though he lays it down as a general\r\nrule by which the physician should regulate his treatment, “to do\r\ngood, or at least to do no harm,”[47] there is ample evidence that on\r\nproper occasions his practice was sufficiently bold and decided. In\r\ninflammatory affections of the chest he bled freely, if not, as has\r\nbeen said, _ad deliquum animi_,[48] and in milder cases he practised\r\ncupping with or without scarification.[49] Though in ordinary cases\r\nof constipation he merely prescribed laxative herbs, such as the\r\nmercury (_mercurialis perennis_),[50] beet,[50] and cabbage,[50] he\r\nhad in reserve elaterium,[51] scammony,[52] spurges,[53] and other\r\ndrastic cathartics, when more potent medicines of this class were\r\nindicated. And although when it was merely wished to evacuate upwards\r\nin a gentle manner, he was content with giving hyssop,[54] and other\r\nsimple means, he did not fail, when it was desirable to make a more\r\npowerful impression, to administer the white hellebore with a degree\r\nof boldness, which his successors in the healing art were afraid\r\nto imitate.[55] A high authority has expressly stated that he was\r\nthe discoverer of the principles of derivation and revulsion in the\r\ntreatment of diseases.[56] Fevers he treated as a general rule, upon\r\nthe diluent system, but did not fail to administer gentle laxatives,\r\nand even to practise venesection in certain cases.[57] When narcotics\r\nwere indicated, he had recourse to mandragora, henbane, and perhaps to\r\npoppy-juice.[58]\r\n\r\nIn the practice of surgery he was a bold operator. He fearlessly,\r\nand as we would now think, in some cases unnecessarily, perforated\r\nthe skull with the trepan and the trephine in injuries of the head.\r\nHe opened the chest also in empyema and hydrothorax. His extensive\r\npractice, and no doubt his great familiarity with the accidents\r\noccurring at the public games of his country, must have furnished him\r\nwith ample opportunities of becoming acquainted with dislocations\r\nand fractures of all kinds; and how well he had profited by the\r\nopportunities which he thus enjoyed, every page of his treatises “On\r\nFractures,” and “On the Articulations,” abundantly testifies. In fact,\r\nuntil within a very recent period, the modern plan of treatment in such\r\ncases was not at all to be compared with his skillful mode of adjusting\r\nfractured bones, and of securing them by means of waxed bandages. In\r\nparticular, his description of the accidents which occur at the elbow-\r\nand hip-joints will be allowed, even at the present day, to display\r\na most wonderful acquaintance with the subject. In the treatment of\r\ndislocations, when human strength was not sufficient to restore the\r\ndisplacement, he skillfully availed himself of all the mechanical\r\npowers which were then known.[59] In his views with regard to the\r\nnature of club-foot, it might have been affirmed of him a few years\r\nago, that he was twenty-four centuries in advance of his profession\r\nwhen he stated that in this case there is no dislocation, but merely a\r\ndeclination of the foot; and that in infancy, by means of methodical\r\nbandaging, a cure may in most cases be effected without any surgical\r\noperation. In a word, until the days of Delpech and Stromeyer, no\r\none entertained ideas so sound and scientific on the nature of this\r\ndeformity as Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nBut I must not allow my enthusiastic admiration to carry me too\r\nfar. I will therefore conclude the present section by making a few\r\nobservations on the peculiar style of our author’s writings. According\r\nto Galen, whose extensive acquaintance with Greek literature rendered\r\nhim a most competent judge, the characteristics of his style are\r\nextreme conciseness, precision, and, in certain cases, obscurity, as\r\nthe natural result of labored brevity.[60] To these traits of character\r\nhe adds, elsewhere, that Hippocrates makes it a rule to avoid all\r\nsuperfluity of discussion and unnecessary repetitions, and never says\r\nmore than what is indispensable.[61] Now, it is no proper objection\r\nto this general view of the character of his style, as stated by M.\r\nLittré, that it is not the same in all his works; as, for example,\r\nin his treatise “On Airs, Waters, and Places,” where the style is\r\ncertainly not so laconic as in some of his others; although, even with\r\nregard to it, I must be permitted to say that I agree with a most\r\ncompetent authority, the late Dr. Coray, that its style is remarkable\r\nfor conciseness.[62] And, indeed, if brevity of expression, bordering\r\nat times upon obscurity, be not the characteristic of the style of\r\nHippocrates, we must admit that his mode of composition is not in\r\naccordance with the taste of his age. There can be no doubt that the\r\nstyle of Hippocrates is nearly akin to that of his contemporary,\r\nthe historian Thucydides, which is thus described by a very acute\r\nand original critic: “The most obvious and characteristic of his\r\npeculiarities is an endeavor to express as much matter as possible\r\nin as few words as possible, to combine many thoughts into one, and\r\nalways to leave the reader to supply something of his own. Hence his\r\nconciseness often becomes obscure.”[63] I would beg leave to add that\r\nother peculiarities in the style of Thucydides, which are severely\r\nanimadverted upon by Dionysius, may be clearly recognized also in the\r\nwritings of Hippocrates, especially irregularities of syntax, with a\r\nsomewhat rude and inartificial mode of constructing his sentences. I\r\nmention this the rather that the English reader may not expect to find\r\nin my translation any of those well-turned periods and graceful modes\r\nof construction by which elegant composition is now distinguished. I\r\nwish it to be known that in making this translation, I have followed\r\nthe example of the modern authority lately referred to, that is to\r\nsay, I have been more studious of fidelity than of elegance, and have\r\nendeavored to give not only the matter, but also the manner, of my\r\nauthor.[64]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs promised above, I here subjoin that Mythical Genealogy of\r\nHippocrates from Tzetzes.\r\n\r\nÆsculapius was the father of Podalirius, who was the father of\r\nHippolochus, who was the father of Sostratus, who was the father\r\nof Dardanus, who was the father of Crisamis, who was the father of\r\nCleomyttades, who was the father of Thedorus, who was the father of\r\nSostratus II., who was the father of Theodorus II., who was the father\r\nof Sostratus III., who was the father of Nebrus, who was the father of\r\nGnosidicus, who was the father of Hippocrates I., who was the father of\r\nHeraclides, who was the father of HIPPOCRATES II., otherwise\r\ncalled the GREAT HIPPOCRATES. (Chiliad. vii., 155.)\r\n\r\nI may also add a few particulars, deserving to be known, respecting\r\nthe family of Hippocrates. As Galen relates, he had two sons, Thessalus\r\nand Draco, each of whom had a son who bore the name of Hippocrates.\r\n(Comment. ii., in Lib. de Nat. Human.) It thus appears that there were\r\nin the family four persons of the name of Hippocrates, closely related\r\nto one another. First, the father of Heraclides, and grandfather\r\nof Hippocrates II.; second, Hippocrates II., our author; third and\r\nfourth, his grandchildren, the sons of Thessalus and Draco. Besides\r\nthese, three or four other members of the family bearing the name of\r\nHippocrates are enumerated by Suidas. Of Thessalus, it is related by\r\nGalen (l.c.) that he adhered strictly to the principles of his father,\r\nand became physician to Archelaus, king of Macedonia. Of Draco little\r\nmention is made, only it is well known that he also followed his\r\nfather’s profession. But of all the family of Hippocrates the Great,\r\nPolybus, his son-in-law, is the most celebrated. Galen calls him the\r\ndisciple of Hippocrates and successor in his school, and adds, that he\r\nmade no innovations on the doctrines of his teacher. (Comment. i., in\r\nLibr. de Nat. Hum.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II.\r\n\r\n      DISQUISITION ON THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE DIFFERENT TREATISES\r\n              WHICH HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO HIPPOCRATES.\r\n\r\nThere can scarcely be a doubt that Hippocrates followed the practice\r\nwhich we know to have been adopted by almost all the great writers of\r\nantiquity with regard to the publication of their works, namely, that\r\nof publishing them separately, at the time they were composed. We know,\r\nfor example (to begin with a distinguished author, regarding whom our\r\ninformation is particularly ample), that Horace published his books of\r\nsatires, epistles, odes, and epodes separately, and at different times;\r\nand that the collection of them in its present form was not compiled\r\nuntil after his death.[65] We have every reason for concluding that\r\nthe same rule was followed by Martial,[66] Cicero,[67] and other Roman\r\nauthors. It is further well ascertained (to come to a period not far\r\nremoved from the age of Hippocrates) that Plato[68] and Aristotle[69]\r\nlikewise gave their works to the literary world upon the same plan. We\r\nhave every reason, therefore, to suppose that Hippocrates published\r\nseveral of his works separately, in his life time; and indeed Galen\r\noften expresses himself so as to leave little or no ground for doubt\r\non this point.[70] It would be most interesting and important then to\r\nknow, were this possible, in what order the different works of our\r\nauthor were published. But unfortunately this is a question which we\r\nhave no proper data for solving satisfactorily, only as the “Aphorisms”\r\nare evidently made up in a great measure of conclusions drawn from the\r\nresults of discussions and observations recorded in other of his works,\r\nwe have every reason to infer that this important work was among that\r\nlatest of his literary labors.[71] But although we may not be able to\r\ndetermine the order in which the different pieces were composed and\r\npublished, we need have no hesitation in deciding with all the best\r\nauthorities, ancient and modern, that all the following treatises\r\nwere composed by him, and, from the first, obtained the sanction of\r\nhis name, viz.: the “Prognostics;” the “First and Third Epidemics;”\r\n“On Regimen in Acute Diseases;” “On Airs, Waters, and Places;” “On\r\nWounds of the Head;” the “Aphorisms.” It is in so far satisfactory,\r\nthen, to know, that respecting the authorship of these works there has\r\nnever been any reasonable question, and that whoever entertains doubts\r\non this point of literary history, ought, on the same principles of\r\ncriticism, to dispute the authenticity of the “Protagoras” and “Phædo”\r\nof Plato; of the “History of Animals” and “Politics” of Aristotle; and\r\nof the “Olynthiacs” and “Philippics” of Demosthenes. In a word, nothing\r\nbut the most lawless spirit of scepticism can lead any one to challenge\r\nthe genuineness of the works which I have just now enumerated. These,\r\nhowever, it will be seen, constitute but a very small portion of the\r\ntreatises contained in the Hippocratic Collection; and with regard\r\nto a very great number of the others, it is unfortunately not only\r\nimpossible to bring any competent evidence of their genuineness, but it\r\nis also quite apparent that they betray marks of an entirely different\r\nauthorship; and this is abundantly obvious, whether we look to the\r\nmatters which they contain, or the manner in which these are given.\r\nThus in some of the treatises we discover hypothetical doctrine and\r\nrules of practice utterly at variance with those which are contained in\r\nthe works of acknowledged authenticity; and in some of them, instead\r\nof that nervous conciseness which, as we have already stated, has\r\nalways been held to be characteristic of the style of Hippocrates, we\r\nfind an insipid verbosity and vagueness of expression, which clearly\r\nstamp them as being productions of a very different hand. But, besides\r\nthis internal evidence which we have to assist us in forming a correct\r\njudgment on these works, we fortunately still possess a considerable\r\nnumber of ancient Commentaries, written expressly in illustration of\r\nthem, from which, in many instances, modern critics have been enabled\r\nto draw very satisfactory data for forming a correct judgment on\r\nthe points at issue. Before proceeding further, it is but fair to\r\nacknowledge that I have freely availed myself of the labors of Vander\r\nLinden, Ackerman, Gruner, Littré, and other learned men, who have\r\npreceded me in this field of investigation, but at the same time I may\r\nventure to assure the reader that there is scarcely a passage in any of\r\nthe ancient authorities, bearing on the points in discussion, which I\r\nhave not examined carefully for myself.\r\n\r\nThe oldest commentator of whom we have any mention, is the\r\ncelebrated Herophilus, who flourished about the year 300 A.C.[72] But\r\nof his Commentaries we have no remains, nor of those of the other\r\ncommentators down to Apollonius Citiensis, a writer of the first\r\ncentury A.C. His Scholia on the Hippocratic treatise, “De Articulis,”\r\nalong with those of Palladius, Stephanus, Theophilus, Meletius, and\r\nJoannes Alexandrinus, all writers of an uncertain date, but certainly\r\nmuch later than the Christian era, were published by the late Dr.\r\nDietz, at Konigsburg, in 1834. To these we have to add two others, of\r\nmuch higher celebrity, namely, Erotian, who lived during the reign\r\nof Nero, and the famous Galen, who, it is well known, flourished in\r\nthe latter part of the second century, P.C. It is from the works of\r\nthese two writers that the most important facts are to be elicited,\r\nfor forming a correct judgment respecting the authenticity of the\r\nHippocratic treatises. As we shall have occasion to quote their\r\nopinions on the different heads of our inquiry, it would be useless to\r\noccupy room by giving their entire list in this place. Suffice it to\r\nsay, that Erotian rarely assigns any reason for admitting the treatises\r\ninto his list of genuine works, and that Galen generally rests his\r\njudgment, when he assigns any grounds for it, upon the evidence of\r\npreceding authorities, and upon what he holds to be the characteristics\r\nof the doctrines and style of Hippocrates. These, assuredly, are most\r\nsound and legitimate principles of criticism; but it has been often\r\nsupposed, that in applying them the great commentator is at times very\r\ndogmatic, and not always consistent with himself. But, upon the whole,\r\nall must allow that Galen is our best guide on the subject of our\r\npresent inquiry. And, moreover, it is from his works especially that we\r\nare enabled to glean whatever information we possess with regard to the\r\nopinions of the earlier commentators, from Herophilus down to his own\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to give a brief sketch of the labors of modern\r\ncritics in this department.\r\n\r\nThe earliest modern authority is Lemos, whose work was published in\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. It appears that he follows almost\r\nentirely the opinions of Galen, and seldom or never ventures to\r\nexercise an independent judgment of his own.\r\n\r\nThe work of Mercuriali is a much more elaborate and important\r\nperformance, and his principles of judgment appear to me most\r\nunexceptionable, being founded entirely upon ancient authority and\r\npeculiarity of style; only it may, perhaps, be objected, that he rather\r\nexaggerates the importance of the latter at the expense of the former;\r\nfor it must be admitted that very contradictory conclusions have\r\nsometimes been founded on imaginary peculiarities of style. I cannot\r\nagree with M. Littré, however, that the whole system of Mercuriali is\r\nfounded on a _petitio principii_; as if, before describing the\r\nstyle of his author, he ought to have decided which were his genuine\r\nwritings.[73] For, as already stated, any one is perfectly warranted in\r\nassuming that certain of the works which bear the name of Hippocrates\r\nare genuine, and from them, and the general voice of antiquity,\r\nMercuriali was further justified in deciding what are the peculiarities\r\nof the style of Hippocrates, and in applying them as a test of the\r\ngenuineness of other works which had been attributed to the same\r\nauthor. Mercuriali divides the Hippocratic treatises into four classes,\r\nas follows: The first comprehends those which bear the characters of\r\nhis doctrine and style. The second comprises those which are composed\r\nof notes taken from memory, and published by Thessalus, Polybus, or\r\nother of his disciples, and contain foreign matter interpolated with\r\nthem. The third class consists of those which have not been composed by\r\nHippocrates, but are the work of his sons or disciples, and represent\r\nhis doctrines with greater or less exactness. The fourth includes those\r\ntracts which have nothing to do with the school of Hippocrates. As\r\nthe views and principles of Mercuriali accord, in the main, very well\r\nwith my own, I think it proper to set down his classification of the\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\n         CLASSIS I.\r\n\r\n    1.

De Hominis Structura         }\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may venture to affirm, without much risk of challenge, that\r\nthe works of no ancient author owe more to the exertions of a single\r\nindividual than those of Hippocrates due to the labors of Foës. Of his\r\nexcellencies as an editor, and expositor of the meaning of his author,\r\nI will have occasion to speak afterwards; and here I shall merely state\r\nregarding him, that as a critic called upon to decide with regard to\r\nthe authenticity and spuriousness of the different works, his merits\r\nare by no means proportionally high. He rarely or never ventures to\r\ndiffer from Galen, and everywhere evinces so easy a disposition to\r\nrecognize the works in question as being the productions of his beloved\r\nauthor, that his opinion on any point connected with their authenticity\r\nis not deserving of much weight.\r\n\r\nHaller arranges the Hippocratic treatises in the following classes:\r\nThe first contains those which in all ages have been admitted as being\r\ngenuine.[75] The second embraces those which contain doctrines at\r\nvariance with those “of the divine old man,” or inventions of a later\r\ndate, or vices which Hippocrates disclaims. The third embraces those\r\nwhich are manifestly spurious, as is obvious from their being mere\r\ncompendia of the works of Hippocrates, or which betray a manner totally\r\nat variance with his. The fourth embraces a certain number of pieces\r\nnot contained in the preceding classes. Such is Haller’s arrangement,\r\nwhich, however, is not entitled to much consideration; for the\r\nillustrious author himself seems to admit, candidly, that his critical\r\nknowledge of the language was too slender to warrant him in trusting\r\nhis own judgment when it came into collision with any high authority,\r\nsuch as Foës; and, moreover, it would appear, that his edition of the\r\nworks of Hippocrates had been got up in a very slovenly manner, by some\r\nincompetent person, after his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nGruner is one the most learned and original of our authorities on the\r\nliterature of the Hippocratic works.[76] His decision, with regard to\r\nthe authenticity of the different pieces, is made to rest mainly on\r\ninternal evidence, that is to say, upon their possessing the proper\r\ncharacteristics of the language and style of Hippocrates. These he\r\nis at great pains in showing to be, in the first place, brevity,\r\napproaching to the laconic, which he justly holds with Galen[77] to\r\nbe one of the most striking peculiarities of the ancient style of\r\nwriting. To conciseness and simplicity, he adds gravity of manner,\r\nand an absence of all subtlety of reasoning. This last trait in the\r\nliterary character of Hippocrates I hold to be particularly apparent in\r\nthe works which are generally admitted to be genuine. Some stress is\r\nalso laid by him on the use of the Ionic dialect, but this is a most\r\nfallacious criterion, and had better have been left out of the question\r\naltogether; as there is good reason to believe that great liberties\r\nwere used with the language of Hippocrates by the ancient editors and\r\ncommentators, more especially by Artemidorus Capito, who lived a short\r\ntime before Galen.[78] And besides, as every person who is generally\r\nacquainted with Greek literature knows, although the Ionic dialect in\r\nthe age of Hippocrates had been fused into the Attic,[79] for several\r\ncenturies afterwards it continued to be arbitrarily used by many\r\nwriters, both of prose and verse, owing to the high character which it\r\npossessed, as being the dialect of the Homeric poems. Hence it is used\r\nin later times, not only by the poets such as Quintus Smyrnæus, Nonnus,\r\nand Oppian, but also by at least one great medical author, I mean\r\nAretæus. It would appear, however, that Gruner himself was sensible\r\nthat much stress ought not to be laid on peculiarity of dialect; for,\r\nin resuming his conclusions as to the proper tests of genuineness\r\nin judging of the Hippocratic writings, he determines them to be\r\nconciseness and gravity of language, paucity of reasoning, and accuracy\r\nof observation, along with the authority of the ancient critics, that\r\nis to say, of the commentators. Now, it certainly must be admitted\r\nthat, taken together, these principles are most just and reasonable;\r\nonly it is apparent, that, like Mercuriali, he has ranked last what he\r\nought to have laid most stress upon, namely, ancient authority. For,\r\nas remarked above, unless ancient authority had previously determined\r\ncertain works in the Collection to be genuine, the modern critic would\r\nhave had no premises from which he could have drawn conclusions as to\r\nthe characteristics of our author’s style. Starting, then, from the\r\nprinciples now stated, Gruner arranges the works of Hippocrates in two\r\ndivisions, namely, the genuine and the supposititous. We shall only\r\ngive the former list, which embraces the following ten treatises:\r\n\r\n    1. Jusjurandum.\r\n    2. Aphorismi.\r\n    3. De Aëre, Aquis, et Locis.\r\n    4. Prænotiones.\r\n    5. Prædictionum, ii.\r\n    6. De Officina Medici.\r\n    7. Popularium Morborum, i., iii.\r\n    8. De Victu Acutorum.\r\n    9. De Vulneribus Capitis.\r\n    10. De Fracturis.\r\n\r\nIt will be shown below that in this list he has admitted one work\r\n(Prædict. ii.), which certainly has not sufficient claims to the place\r\nwhich he has assigned it; and, on the other hand, he has acted most\r\ninconsistently in rejecting the work “De Articulis,” while he admitted\r\n“De Fracturis,” for, as we shall see, there is the strongest reason for\r\nbelieving that the two originally constituted one work. But the truth\r\nof the matter is, that Gruner having hastily adopted the notion that\r\nHippocrates was altogether ignorant of human anatomy, the celebrated\r\npassage in this treatise which so strikingly alludes to the dissection\r\nof the human body[80] would decide him to reject it from his list of\r\ngenuine works.\r\n\r\nThough Le Clerc, in his “History of Medicine” (b. iii.), shows himself\r\nto be well acquainted with the fact that many of the treatises ascribed\r\nto Hippocrates are supposititious, he nowhere lays down any rules for\r\ndistinguishing the genuine from the spurious, only he insists strongly\r\non conciseness as being one of the most striking characteristics of the\r\nstyle of Hippocrates, and shrewdly remarks that the treatises which\r\nabound most in reasoning are those which are most suspected of being\r\nspurious.\r\n\r\nSchulze also, in his “History of Medicine,” with much learning\r\nand excellent judgment, enters cursorily upon the examination of\r\nthe question regarding the genuineness of the works ascribed to\r\nHippocrates, but he scarcely ever deviates from the rules laid down\r\nby Mercuriali and Le Clerc. Indeed, he almost always agrees with the\r\nlatter. We shall have occasion to refer pretty frequently to his\r\nopinions when we come to give our own judgment on the authenticity of\r\nthe particular treatises contained in the Hippocratic Collection.\r\n\r\nAckerman,[81] in the first place, gives an elaborate and very lucid\r\nexposition of the labors of all preceding critics in the same line,\r\nand then proceeds to deliver his own opinions _seriatim_ on the\r\ndifferent treatises. He rests his judgment generally on the authority\r\nof the ancients, and more especially of Erotian and Galen; and in so\r\ndoing, M. Littré thinks he acted so judiciously, that he does not\r\nhesitate to pronounce Ackerman to be the safest guide which we can\r\nfollow. Like Gruner, he divides the works into two classes, the genuine\r\nand the spurious. The former list is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. Epidemica, i., iii.\r\n    2. Prænotiones.\r\n    3. Prædictorum, ii.\r\n    4. Aphorismi.\r\n    5. De Victu Acutorum.\r\n    6. De Aëre, Aquis, Locis.\r\n    7. De Vulneribus Capitis.\r\n\r\nThis, it will be remarked, is the smallest list which we have yet\r\nencountered, and one cannot but feel saddened to find the remains of\r\nthe great Hippocrates thus reduced to so small a compass. We shall\r\nhave occasion, however, by and by, to show that Ackerman has been\r\ntoo unsparing in applying the obelisk[82] to treatises of suspected\r\nauthenticity.\r\n\r\nGrimm, the German translator of Hippocrates, professes also, like\r\nAckerman, to be guided principally by ancient authority, such as that\r\nof Galen and Erotian, but he only reposes full confidence in it when\r\nconfirmed by internal evidence. The style, he says, should be simple,\r\nbrief, and expressive, and the language in accordance with the epoch.\r\nHe adds, no hypothesis, no subtlety, however ancient, no extraordinary\r\nremedies or modes of treatment, should be found in these books.\r\nStarting from these principles, which, it will be remarked, are rather\r\nfancifully laid down, Grimm reduces the number of genuine works to the\r\nfollowing very meagre list:\r\n\r\n    1. Popularium Morborum, i., iii.\r\n    2. Prognostica.\r\n    3. Aphorismi.\r\n    4. De Victu Acutorum, p. i.\r\n    5. De Aëre, Aquis, Locis.\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to remark, in this result of Grimm’s inquiry,\r\nindications of that bold spirit of scepticism for which the learned\r\ncriticism of Germany has been distinguished of late--the spirit of her\r\nWolfs and Lachmans, of her Asts and Schliermachers, which has deprived\r\nthe Iliad and Odyssey of their ancient authorship, and reduced the\r\nbulky tomes of Plato to a very small volume. It is impossible not to\r\nadmire the learning, the ingenuity, and the love of truth which these\r\ncritics display, but surely the sober judgment of other scholars,\r\nnot infected with the same spirit of innovation, will pause before\r\nacquiescing in the justness of a verdict which would deprive so many\r\nimmortal performances of the _prestige_ with which they have so\r\nlong been regarded. For my own part, I would venture to say, _pace\r\ntantorum virorum_, that these learned critics are deficient in a\r\npractical acquaintance with the laws of evidence, and do not properly\r\ntake into account that, in matters of common life, negative evidence is\r\nnever allowed to bear down positive, unless the former be remarkably\r\nstrong, and the latter particularly weak. When, then, the voice of\r\nantiquity pronounces strongly and consistently in favor of any work, no\r\nnegative evidence, unless of a very remarkable character, ought to be\r\nallowed to counterbalance the positive. In short, what I object to in\r\nGrimm is, that he gives an undue preponderance to the internal evidence\r\nover the external, that is to say, over the traditionary evidence of\r\nantiquity, and that in this respect he goes to greater lengths than\r\neven Gruner and Ackerman.\r\n\r\nKurt Sprengel is the author of a separate work on the Hippocratic\r\nwritings[83] which I have not seen, but I have reason to believe that\r\nthe substance of it is contained in his “History of Medicine,” where\r\n(t. i., p. 295) he enters into a very elaborate disquisition on the\r\nauthenticity of the works ascribed to Hippocrates. He insists much, as\r\na test of authenticity, upon the style, which, in imitation of Galen,\r\nhe describes as being concise and laconic to a degree which sometimes\r\nrenders it obscure. Hippocrates, he adds, avoids all superfluous\r\ndiscussion and unseasonable repetitions, and expresses himself as\r\nbriefly as possible, without adding conditions or restrictions. He\r\njustly remarks, that what Celsus says of Hippocrates, namely, that he\r\nseparated philosophy from medicine, must be received with considerable\r\nlimitations, and not in too strict a sense, as if there were no\r\nphilosophical tenets in his works. On the other hand, Sprengel uses\r\nthese philosophical doctrines as a guide for determining the date of\r\nthe different treatises. This is a new, and no doubt a very important,\r\nelement in the criticism of these works; but it is one very liable to\r\nbe abused, as our information on many occasions, with regard to the\r\nintroduction of new doctrines in philosophy, is by no means such as\r\ncan be safely trusted to. Sprengel’s opinion on the various works in\r\nquestion we shall have occasion to state when we come to revise them\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed to the examination of the labors of two very learned\r\nand ingenious critics, Link and Petersen, who, treading in the\r\nfootsteps of Sprengel, have expended much research in endeavoring to\r\nsolve the question regarding the date of the Hippocratic treatises, by\r\nconsidering the philosophical and pathological theories which prevail\r\nin them. I think it right to state that I have not had an opportunity\r\nof consulting the work of Link, and therefore have been obliged to\r\njudge of his opinions, in a great measure, from Petersen’s essay, which\r\nis professedly based on the principles of Link. Of Peterson’s little\r\ntract, I have no hesitation in declaring that I have seldom seen a work\r\nof the kind which displays more critical acumen and deep research; and\r\nalthough I cannot bring myself to subscribe to many of his general\r\nconclusions, I feel bound in gratitude to acknowledge the benefits\r\nwhich I have derived from many of his special investigations.[84] On\r\none important point, which he is at great pains to make out, I have\r\nalready stated that I am disposed to agree with him, namely, respecting\r\nthe date of our author’s birth, which I certainly think he has proved\r\nby the most unexceptionable authorities to have been considerably\r\nearlier than as generally stated. Petersen divides the Hippocratic\r\nworks into nine classes, in the following chronological order:--The\r\nfirst contains those treatises in which the flow of bile and phlegm\r\nis considered to be the cause of disease;[85] the second recognizes\r\nfire,[86] and the third, air, as the principle of things;[87] in the\r\nfourth, bile and phlegm are spoken of as the primary humors of the\r\nhuman body;[88] in the fifth, spirit (πνεῦμα) and humidity are held to\r\nbe the first principles of generation;[89] in the sixth, the elements\r\nof the body are held to be contrary to one another;[90] in the seventh,\r\nyellow and black bile, phlegm, and blood are set down as being the\r\nprimary humors of the human body:[91] in the eighth bile, water,\r\nphlegm, and blood are held to be the primary humors;[92] and in the\r\nninth, fire and water are held to be the principles of things.[93]\r\n\r\nNow, assuredly, no reasonable person will deny to the author of this\r\ndistribution the praise of great boldness and originality of thought.\r\nWe may well apply to him the words of the poet, that if he has failed\r\nin attaining his object, “magnis tamen excidit ausis.” For my own\r\npart, I cannot but regret to see so much talent and research expended\r\nupon conjectural points of criticism, which, from their nature, can\r\nnever be determined with any degree of certainty; for, after all his\r\nlabors, few scholars, I venture to predict, will prefer being guided\r\nby his hypothetical reasoning, however ingenious, rather than by the\r\nauthority of the ancient commentators. I must also use the liberty to\r\nremark, that M. Petersen appears to me to have no well defined ideas\r\nregarding the doctrines which the ancient philosophers held respecting\r\nthe elements of things. For example, when he states, as the basis of\r\nthe theory which prevails in the tract “On Ancient Medicine,” that the\r\nelements are the contraries to one another, he evidently confounds the\r\nelements, namely, fire, air, earth, and water, with the powers, or, as\r\nwe should now call them, the qualities, hot, cold, moist, and dry. (See\r\nthe next Section.) And although, in the treatises “On the Seventh Month\r\nFœtus,” and “On the Eighth Month Fœtus,” much and deserved importance\r\nis attached to heat as the prime mover of conception, and although, in\r\nthe treatise “On Airs,” the importance of air as a cause of disease\r\nbe strongly insisted upon, one is not warranted, as he contends, in\r\nconcluding that the authors of these treatises recognize respectively\r\nfire and air as the first principle of all things. M. Littré, also, in\r\nhis candid reviews of M. Petersen’s work, points out some very striking\r\noversights which M. Petersen has committed in his arrangement of the\r\ndifferent treatises.[94]\r\n\r\nI now come to M. Littré, who, in the Introduction to his edition of\r\nHippocrates, has certainly surpassed all who went before him, in the\r\nextent of his labors on the general literature of the Hippocratic\r\nTreatises. How highly I estimate his work I need not here stop to\r\ndeclare; indeed the reputation it has already gained is so established,\r\nthat it would be vain to blame and useless to praise it. I have to\r\nexpress my regret, however, in entering upon my exposition of his\r\nopinions, that they are given in a very expanded form, and with a\r\ndegree of diffuseness, _plus quam Galenica_, so that I find it\r\ndifficult, within my necessary limits, to convey to the reader a\r\ndistinct view of the very important matters which M. Littré has brought\r\ntogether to bear upon his subject.\r\n\r\nHe is at great pains to establish the following positions with regard\r\nto the various treatises contained in the Collection which bears the\r\nname of Hippocrates: 1st. That the Collection did not exist in an\r\nauthentic form, earlier than the date of Herophilus and his disciples,\r\nthat is to say, until nearly 100 years after the death of Hippocrates.\r\n2d. That it contains portions which certainly do not belong to\r\nHippocrates; and, 3d, also Collections of Notes, etc., which would\r\nnever have been published by the author in their present form; and,\r\n4th, Compilations, which are either abridged, or copied word for word\r\nfrom other works which still form part of the Collection. 5th. As the\r\ndifferent treatises do not belong to the same author, so neither were\r\nthey all composed at the same time, some being much more modern than\r\nthe others. 6th. We find in the Collection mention made of numerous\r\ntreatises written by the followers of Hippocrates, which are now lost,\r\nand which were no longer in existence when the Collection was first\r\npublished. 7th. The most ancient writers do not know, for certain,\r\nto whom the several works forming the Collection belonged; 8th, with\r\nthe exception of a small number, which all of them, for one reason or\r\nanother, agreed in attributing to Hippocrates himself.[95]\r\n\r\nI have now a few observations to make upon each of these positions.\r\nThe first, which is a most important one in connection with our present\r\nsubject, I regret to say, is, I think, by no means satisfactorily made\r\nout by M. Littré. He shows, it is true, that Herophilus is the first\r\ncommentator on any of the Hippocratic Treatises of whom there is any\r\nmention, but all we know of his labors in this line merely amounts to\r\nthis, that he had commented on certain passages in the “Prognostics,”\r\nand probably also in the “Aphorisms,”[96] but I do not see that this\r\namounts to any proof either that the Collection was or was not formed\r\nin his time. The proof of the second position is made to rest upon\r\na fact, which has attracted the attention of all the critics on the\r\nHippocratic Treatises, namely, that a memorable description of the\r\nveins, which appears in the Hippocratic treatise “On the Nature of\r\nMan,” is published by Aristotle, in the third book of his “History of\r\nAnimals,” as the production of his son-in-law, Polybus. Now, M. Littré\r\nargues here, that as the publication of the Aristotelian Collection did\r\nnot take place until long after that of the Hippocratic, the persons\r\nwho made the latter could not have taken the passage in question from\r\nthe other, and the only way in which we can account for the change\r\nof title, is by supposing that the works of Polybus had retained the\r\nname of their true author in the days of Aristotle, but had lost it\r\nat the time the Hippocratic Collection was made. Hence he infers that\r\nthe Hippocratic Collection must have been made subsequently to the\r\ntime of Aristotle.[97] But I must say that I do not recognize the\r\nforce of this argument; for, although the whole of Aristotle’s works\r\nwere not published in a collected form, until the time of Apellicon,\r\nwe have every reason to believe that many of his works were published\r\nseparately, in his own lifetime. The fact, then, would rather tell the\r\nother way, and it might be argued, that the Hippocratic Collection must\r\nhave been made before the time of Aristotle, otherwise the persons\r\nwho made it would never have fallen into the mistake of attributing\r\nto Hippocrates a passage which so high an authority as Aristotle had\r\nreferred to Polybus. But the truth is, that we are not entitled to\r\ndraw any positive inference from all this, with regard to the epoch in\r\nquestion. It is well known that, in all ages, literary publications\r\nhave sometimes come abroad into the world in an anonymous shape; and it\r\nneed excite no surprise that with regard to the fragment in question,\r\nas in many other cases, there should have been a diversity of opinion\r\nas to its authorship.\r\n\r\nThe third we shall see fully made out in our analysis of the different\r\ntreatises given below.\r\n\r\nThe fourth will also be clearly proved, when we come to the examination\r\nof certain treatises, as, for example, the “Officina Medici.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth is not made out to my satisfaction. M. Littré, however,\r\nthinks it is satisfactorily proved that the latest epoch of these\r\nproductions does not come lower down than Aristotle and Praxagoras,\r\nand none so low as Erasistratus and Herophilus. Hence he draws the\r\nconclusion that the Collection must have been made between the time of\r\nAristotle and Herophilus.[98]\r\n\r\nThe sixth we shall see clearly made out, in our critique on the\r\nseparate treatises.\r\n\r\nThe seventh is abundantly evident from what has been already stated,\r\nand will be made more apparent in the subsequent parts of this Section.\r\nBut there is nothing peculiar to the Hippocratic Collection in all\r\nthis, for there is as great uncertainty respecting many of the works\r\nascribed to Plato, and other collections of pieces which have come\r\ndown to us from high antiquity. Nay, every person who is conversant\r\nwith biblical criticism must be aware how difficult it has proved to\r\ndetermine the authorship of many of the Psalms which bear the sainted\r\nname of King David.[99]\r\n\r\nIn support of the eighth position, little need be said in addition\r\nto what has been already stated. I need only repeat briefly that we\r\nhave as much certainty that some of the treatises in the Hippocratic\r\nCollection are genuine, as we have that any other ancient works which\r\nhave come down to us are the productions of the authors whose names\r\nthey bear. But I hasten to give M. Littré’s distribution of the\r\ndifferent works in the Collection. He divides them into the following\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n    CLASS I.--The Works which truly belong to Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n    1. On Ancient Medicine.\r\n    2. The Prognostics.\r\n    3.

The first Book of Doses--the Small.\r\n\r\n    CLASS XI.--Apocryphal pieces--Letters and Discourses.\r\n\r\nSuch is the classification of M. Littré, which he professes to have\r\nfounded on the four following rules, or principles: firstly, on the\r\nauthority of direct witnesses, that is to say, of authors who preceded\r\nthe formation of the Alexandrian Library; secondly, on the consent of\r\nthe ancient critics; thirdly, on the application of certain points\r\nin the history of medicine, which appear to him to offer a date, and\r\nconsequently a positive determination; fourthly, on the concordance of\r\nthe doctrines, the similitude of the writings, and the characters of\r\nthe style. Of these rules, the one which he professes to have been most\r\nguided by is the first, all the others being of subordinate importance.\r\nFrom what has now been stated, the reader will not fail to remark that\r\nthe principles upon which the classification of Littré is founded\r\nscarcely differ at all from those of Ackerman. The reasonableness of\r\nthese rules, moreover, no one, I presume, will venture to call in\r\nquestion, whatever may be thought of the judgment with which they\r\nare applied in particular instances. My own opinions on this point I\r\nneed not state here, as they will come out more properly in my own\r\ndisquisition on the characters of the particular treatises.\r\n\r\nBut, before concluding this part of my task, I must not neglect to\r\nnotice the learned labors of a much esteemed friend and countryman--the\r\nfirst, the last, the only, scholar (I lament to say) which England\r\nhas produced in this department of ancient criticism--Dr. Greenhill,\r\nof Oxford, who, in his excellent article on _Hippocrates_ in\r\nSmith’s “Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology,” enters\r\ninto a very elaborate disquisition on the authenticity of the various\r\nworks which compose the Collection. His general distribution appears\r\nto me to be very ingenious, and his judgment in particular cases most\r\ncorrect, but it is proper I should state that I, perhaps, am scarcely\r\nqualified to pronounce an impartial judgment on this point, having had\r\nthe honor of being consulted by the author, as he himself candidly\r\nacknowledges, while he was employed on this task. On the following page\r\nis his tabular view of the different divisions and subdivisions of the\r\nCollection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving now finished this survey of the labors of preceding inquirers,\r\nI proceed to state the results of my own investigations in the same\r\ndepartment; and in doing so, I shall give _seriatim_ the evidence\r\nfor and against the authenticity of the different treatises, along\r\nwith my own decision in every instance. And, in order to add to the\r\nvalue of this disquisition, I mean to give an abstract of the contents\r\nof those works which I look upon as spurious, that the reader may be\r\nenabled to compare the doctrines contained in them with those which are\r\ndelivered in the treatises which are recognized as genuine. Moreover,\r\nit is my object that the present volume should contain a summary of all\r\nthe valuable matters to be found in the Hippocratic Treatises, whether\r\ngenuine or not.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, I must state the _rules by which I test\r\nthe genuineness of the works in the Hippocratic Collection_:\r\n\r\n1. All the works which are acknowledged as genuine by the ancient\r\ncommentators and lexicographers which have come down to us, and\r\nespecially by Erotian and Galen, are to be admitted as such, unless\r\nit can be shown that still older authorities held a different opinion\r\nregarding them, or that they contain doctrines and views decidedly at\r\nvariance with those contained in the treatises which all allow to be\r\ngenuine, or that the style and mode of handling the subject matter be\r\naltogether different from the well-known method of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n2. The peculiar style and method of Hippocrates are held to\r\nbe--conciseness of expression, great condensation of matter, and\r\ndisposition to regard all professional subjects in a practical point\r\nof view, to eschew subtle hypotheses, and modes of treatment based on\r\nvague abstractions.\r\n\r\n                   The Hippocratic Collection consists of\r\n                                    |\r\n            +-----------------------+------------------------+\r\n            |                       |                        |\r\n Works certainly written    Works certainly not    Works _perhaps_ written\r\n     by Hippocrates,            written by             by Hippocrates,\r\n       Class I.[101]             Hippocrates.

No treatise is to be received as genuine which is not recognized\r\nas such by any one of the ancient authorities, however strong a case\r\nmay be made out in favor of its claims by modern critics from internal\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n           I. Περὶ ἀρχαίης ἰητρικῆς--_On Ancient Medicine_.\r\n\r\nOf all the treatises which are recognized as the genuine productions\r\nof “The Great Hippocrates,” by M. Littré, this is decidedly the one\r\nwhich possesses the most questionable title to that honor. The only\r\nancient authority that admits it as such is Erotian; it is passed\r\nover unnoticed by Galen and Palladius; and Athenæus does not scruple\r\nto affirm, respecting it, that some considered the one half of it\r\nspurious, and others the whole. (Deipn., ii., 16.) Foës, Schulze, and\r\nZuinger,[109] are almost the only modern names in its favor; and it is\r\nrejected by Mercuriali, Gruner, Conringius, Ackerman, and Kühn.[110]\r\nThe grounds, however, upon which Ackerman decides against its\r\nauthenticity are of little weight, namely, that as it is stated in it\r\n(§ 1, 2) that medical works were numerous at the time it was composed,\r\nthis circumstance implies a date considerably posterior to Hippocrates.\r\nBut it is to be borne in mind, that Xenophon, who was almost\r\ncontemporary with Hippocrates, puts into the mouth of Socrates, who\r\nwas certainly nearly of the same age, the saying, that there were many\r\nmedical works then in existence (Memorab., iv.), so that at all events\r\nthe argument of Ackerman falls to the ground. M. Littré, moreover,\r\nespouses its claims with remarkable zeal, and persuades himself that\r\nhe has settled this point by showing that a passage in the Phædrus\r\nof Plato,[111] which is quoted by Galen, as referring to a sentiment\r\ncontained in the Hippocratic treatise “De Natura Pueri,”[112] does, in\r\nfact, have reference to the work now under consideration. This position\r\nhe labors hard to establish, and succeeds at last so much to his own\r\nsatisfaction, that he does not hesitate to declare, as the result of\r\nhis elaborate disquisition, “that he had demonstrated the treatise “On\r\nAncient Medicine” to be the work of Hippocrates.”[113] Now, I must be\r\npermitted to say, with great deference to M. Littré, that his prolix\r\nprocess of argumentation, spun out as it is over twenty-six pages, does\r\nnot carry the same conviction to my mind as it does to his own.[114]\r\nBut still, as this treatise has, at all events, one ancient authority\r\nin its favor, and as the matter contained in it appears to me to be\r\nhighly valuable, I have not scrupled to follow the example of M. Littré\r\nin placing it at the head of the Works of Hippocrates. I shall have\r\noccasion to say more on the contents of it in the Argument prefixed to\r\nmy translation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   II. Προγνωστικόν--_Prognostics_.\r\n\r\nOf the genuineness of this work there has never been any question,\r\nso far as I am aware, from the time of the earliest of the ancient\r\ncommentators, Herophilus, down to the present day.[115] That it is an\r\nadmirable specimen of the plan upon which the Hippocratic practice was\r\nfounded, there can be no doubt. The most important critical question\r\nto be decided with regard to it is the relation it bears to two other\r\ntreatises on the same subject, namely, the “Prorrhetica,” and “Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones,” whether the “Prognostics” be founded on them, or whether\r\nthey be made up from the “Prognostics.” This question will come more\r\nproperly to be discussed in the Argument to the “Prognostics.”\r\n\r\nOf this treatise there have been the following translations into\r\nEnglish:\r\n\r\n    “The Booke of the Presages of the Divine Hippocrates, divided\r\n    into three parts, etc. By Peter Low, Arrelian Doctor in the\r\n    Faculty of Chirurgery in Paris. Lond., 1597.”\r\n\r\n    “The Prognostics and Prorrhetics of Hippocrates, translated\r\n    from the original Greek, with large annotations, critical and\r\n    explanatory; to which is prefixed a short account of the Life\r\n    of Hippocrates. By John Moffat. Lond., 1788.”\r\n\r\n    “Hippocrates on Air, Water, and Situation: or, Prognostics,\r\n    etc. By Francis Clifton, M.D. Lond., 1734.”\r\n\r\nOf these the last is the only one which possesses the slightest claim\r\nto consideration. It is the work of a scholar, who had evidently\r\npaid the most studious attention to his author with the intention of\r\npublishing a new edition of his works, a design, by the way, which\r\nit is much to be regretted, that he did not live to execute. What\r\nbecame of his literary labors in this department I have never been\r\nable to ascertain. The greatest fault I find with his translation\r\nis the quaintness of his style; for it cannot be alleged of him, as\r\nof Moffat, that he often mistakes the meaning of his author. The\r\ntranslations of the latter are utterly worthless, in fact, they are\r\ndisgraceful to the translator, who ought to have been ashamed to engage\r\nin a task for which he was so utterly unqualified. The translations\r\nby Low are done in a strangely antiquated style, and otherwise have\r\nnothing to recommend them on the score of fidelity. Moreover, all\r\nthese translators introduce confusion into the subject by mixing up\r\ntogether the contents of the “Prognostica,” “Prorrhetica,” and “Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones.” Even Clifton is guilty of this indiscretion, although\r\nbetter might have been expected from him; for, considering how well\r\nacquainted he appears to have been with the spirit of his author,\r\nhe ought to have been able to appreciate properly the obligations\r\nwhich Hippocrates had conferred on his profession by methodising\r\nsubject-matters which had previously been destitute of scientific\r\narrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     III. Ἀφορισμοί--_Aphorisms_.\r\n\r\nThat the greater part of the Book of Aphorisms is the work of\r\nHippocrates himself there can be little or no doubt, but that it\r\ncontains interpolations, some of which are of high antiquity, is\r\nequally indisputable. This is distinctly stated by Galen.[116] On this\r\nsubject I would beg leave to quote the remarks of Dr. Greenhill: “Some\r\ndoubts have arisen in the minds of several eminent critics as to the\r\norigin of the Aphorisms, and, indeed, the discussion of the genuineness\r\nof this work may be said to be an epitome of the questions relating to\r\nthe whole Hippocratic Collection. We find here a very celebrated work,\r\nwhich has, from early times, borne the name of Hippocrates, but of\r\nwhich some parts have always been condemned as spurious. Upon examining\r\nthese portions, which are considered to be genuine, we observe that\r\nthe greater part of the first three sections agrees almost word for\r\nword with passages to be found in his acknowledged works; while in the\r\nremaining sections we find sentences taken apparently from spurious or\r\ndoubtful treatises, thus adding greatly to our difficulties, inasmuch\r\nas they sometimes contain doctrines and theories opposed to those\r\nwhich we find in the works acknowledged to be genuine. And these\r\nfacts are (in the opinion of the critics alluded to) to be accounted\r\nfor in one of two ways; either Hippocrates himself, in his old age\r\n(for the Aphorisms have always been attributed to this period of his\r\nlife), put together certain extracts from his own works, to which were\r\nafterwards added other sentences taken from later authors; or else,\r\nthe collection was not formed by Hippocrates himself, but by some\r\nperson or persons after his death, who made aphoristical extracts from\r\nhis works, and from those of other writers, of a later date, and the\r\nwhole was attributed to Hippocrates, because he was the author of the\r\nsentences that were most valuable and came first in order. This account\r\nof the formation of the Aphorisms appears extremely plausible, nor does\r\nit seem to be any decisive objection to say, that we find among them\r\nsentences which are not to be met with elsewhere; for when we recollect\r\nhow many works of the old medical writers, and perhaps of Hippocrates\r\nhimself, are lost, it is easy to conceive that these sentences may have\r\nbeen extracted from some treatise that is no longer in existence. It\r\nmust, however, be confessed, that this conjecture, however plausible\r\nand probable, requires further proof and examination before it can be\r\nreceived as true.”[117] The fact of the matter is, that interpolation\r\nis a mode of corruption from which few works of antiquity have escaped\r\naltogether free, and it was, no doubt, often practised upon them in\r\na very innocent manner, and without any fraudulent intention. Thus,\r\nwhen the subject treated of by any author came afterwards to receive\r\nany notable improvements or alterations, the possessors of such a\r\nwork would naturally mark them down on the margins of their MS., and\r\nthese annotations in the course of transcription would often come to\r\nbe incorporated with the genuine text. Such a work as the Aphorisms,\r\nconsisting of detached sentences, was particularly liable to suffer in\r\nthe manner now adverted to. Another mode of vitiation, which has been\r\nfrequently practised upon ancient works, is the addition of appendices\r\nto them. Every classical reader must be aware that the Odyssey of Homer\r\nis generally admitted by the critics to have come down to us in this\r\nstate; nay, many learned divines do not scruple to admit that certain\r\nportions of the Sacred Volume have not been exempt from this casualty.\r\nI may mention that the last chapter of the Pentateuch, the last Psalm\r\nin the Septuagint, and even the last chapter of the Gospel of St. John,\r\nhave been suspected, by very able critics, of being appendices. I have\r\nstated in another place (PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., p. 437),\r\nthat an addition in this way has probably been made to the medical\r\nworks of Aëtius. On the addition of appendices to works, see further,\r\nGalen (de Placit. Hippocrat. et Plat., vi., 3). Taking all this into\r\naccount, it need excite no wonder that an appendix should have been\r\nadded, by some unknown hand, to the seven sections of Aphorisms, and,\r\naccordingly, it is generally admitted that the eighth section is\r\nspurious.\r\n\r\nI shall reserve my analysis of the contents of the genuine sections to\r\nthe Argument prefixed to the translation.\r\n\r\nWe have the following translations of the Aphorisms into English: “The\r\nAphorisms of Hippocrates”, translated into English:\r\n\r\n    “By S. H. Load. 1610.”\r\n    “By Conrad Sprengel. Lond. 1708.”\r\n    “By T. Coar. Lond. 1822.”\r\n    “By J. W. Underwood. Lond. 1828.”\r\n\r\nOf these I have only carefully examined the translations by Sprengel\r\nand Coar. That of Sprengel displays considerable pretensions to\r\nerudition, but, upon a careful examination, it will be quite apparent\r\nthat the translator was not possessed of a competent acquaintance\r\neither with the Greek or English language. In short, nothing can be\r\nconceived more quaint, inelegant, and inaccurate, than the language of\r\nthis translation. Lest I should be suspected of prejudices against my\r\npredecessor, and of exaggerating his faults, I shall subjoin a short\r\nlist of passages which I hold to be mistranslated, so that the reader\r\nmay judge for himself, whether my opinion of the work be well founded\r\nor not. (See Aph. i., 11,[118] 15,[119] 20,[120] 23;[121] ii., 6,[122]\r\n15,[123] 27, 31, 34, 40; iii., 16, 21.)\r\n\r\nThe production of Coar is not destitute of some merit, although it is\r\nbut too apparent that he was not fully competent for the task which\r\nhe had undertaken. He gives, separately, every Aphorism in Greek, to\r\nwhich he subjoins first a Latin and then an English translation. In\r\nthe Preface, he admits that “in executing the English translation\r\nconsiderable assistance had been derived from the elegant French\r\ntranslation of M. de Mercy.” From this admission it will readily be\r\ngathered, that the translator felt conscious that he did not possess\r\na proper acquaintance with the language of the original. I subjoin\r\nreferences to a few of the passages which, upon examination, appeared\r\nto me to be incorrectly rendered. (See Aph. i., 2,[124] 10,[125]\r\n20;[126] ii., 49;[127] iii., 11,[128] 26, 31; iv., 1; v., 26, 44, 68.)\r\n\r\n\r\n      IV. Ἐπιδημιῶν α’ και γ’--_The First and Third Books of the\r\n                              Epidemics_.\r\n\r\nThese are among the most undoubtedly genuine remains of Hippocrates,\r\nand well sustain the high reputation of their great author. In fact, of\r\nall the earlier records of medicine, these are about the most precious\r\nwhich have come down to us. Although, as I have stated, no one has\r\nquestioned their genuineness, Galen complains that, by some mishap\r\nor other, they had not wholly escaped from some derangement of the\r\nsubject-matters which they contain, and from additions being made to\r\nthem.[129]\r\n\r\nThe following, I believe, are the only English translations of them\r\nwhich have ever been published.\r\n\r\n    “A Comment on forty-two histories described by Hippocrates in\r\n    the First, and Third Books of his Epidemics. By J. Floyer.”\r\n\r\n    “The History of Epidemics, by Hippocrates, in Seven Books.\r\n    Translated into English from the Greek, with Notes and\r\n    Observations. By Samuel Farr, M.D. Lond. 1780.”\r\n\r\nThe former of these I have not been able to see. The other, although\r\nit appears to have been got up with considerable care, is manifestly\r\nthe work of a man not properly acquainted with the language and\r\ndoctrines of his author. In proof of this, I subjoin below a few\r\nexamples collected from the first book, near the beginning.[130]\r\n\r\n\r\n      V. Περὶ διαίτης ὸξέων--_On the Regimen in Acute Diseases_.\r\n\r\nThis work is acknowledged as genuine by Erotian,[131] Palladius,[132]\r\nand Galen,[133] and other ancient authorities, as well as by all the\r\nmodern critics, from Mercuriali and Lemos down to Littré and Greenhill.\r\nThe authenticity of the latter part, indeed, is questioned by Galen,\r\nwho pronounces the style, theories, and language to be different from\r\nthose of Hippocrates. Yet even he admits that it is of great antiquity,\r\nbeing more ancient than the time of Erasistratus, who lived within less\r\nthan a century from the death of Hippocrates.[134] Even if not genuine,\r\nthen, this part (which is published by M. Littré as an appendix)\r\npossesses great value, not only as containing important matter, but\r\nas furnishing us with the opinions of the Coan school at a very early\r\nperiod after the time of our author. We shall have occasion to give\r\na fuller analysis of its contents, in the Argument prefixed to the\r\ntranslation of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n   VI. Περὶ ἀέρων, ὑδάτων, καὶ τόπων--_On Airs, Waters, and Places_.\r\n\r\nFortunately there are no reasonable grounds for questioning the\r\nauthenticity of this highly important work. It is admitted as genuine\r\nby Erotian, Palladius,[135] Athenæus,[136] and Galen,[137] and by\r\nevery one of the modern critics, with the exception of Haller, who\r\npronounces against it upon very insufficient grounds. He argues that\r\nit is obvious, from its contents, that the author of this treatise\r\nwas a European, which cannot be said of Hippocrates, seeing that his\r\nnative place, Cos, was one of the Asiatic islands.[138] But, if Haller\r\nhad possessed any competent acquaintance with classical literature, he\r\nmust have been aware that all the inhabitants of the islands adjoining\r\nto Asia Minor were colonists from Greece, and consequently looked upon\r\nthemselves as Europeans, and not as Asiatics.[139] Nor is this more\r\nremarkable than that the present inhabitants of America should rank\r\nthemselves ethnologically with the Europeans, and not with the native\r\ninhabitants of the country they now occupy.\r\n\r\nAn edition of this treatise, with a French translation, was published\r\nat Paris by a learned modern Greek, Dr. Coray, in the beginning of this\r\ncentury; the annotations to which are highly valuable. The only English\r\ntranslation of it which we possess, as far as I know, is the following:\r\n\r\n    “Hippocrates upon Air, Water, and Situation. By Francis\r\n    Clifton, M.D. Lond. 1734.”\r\n\r\nThis, I am inclined to think, is the best English translation which we\r\nhave of any of the Hippocratic treatises. It is generally accurate,\r\nand the only drawback to it which I am aware of, is the style, which\r\nis often exceedingly quaint and obsolete. The translator, as we stated\r\nabove, was well acquainted with all the works of Hippocrates, and of\r\nhis painstaking industry the notes in this treatise bear undoubted\r\nevidence. Of these I have availed myself, whenever I could derive any\r\nassistance from them, but from the translation itself I have never\r\ncopied literally.\r\n\r\n\r\n               VII. Περὶ ἄρθρων--_On the Articulations_.\r\n\r\nThis work was received as genuine by all the ancient commentators,\r\nfrom Bacchius and Philinus, the disciples of Herophilus, down to\r\nErotian, Galen,[140] and Palladius.[141] It was also admitted by\r\nall the earlier modern critics, down to Gruner, who rejected it on\r\nthese grounds: 1. Because it contains a reference to the treatise “On\r\nGlands,” which all acknowledge to be spurious. 2. That in the course\r\nof the work a degree of anatomical knowledge is evinced, far beyond\r\nwhat its actual state in the time of Hippocrates would warrant. 3. That\r\nthe legend of the Amazons, which is received as true history in the\r\ntreatise “On Airs, etc.” is rejected as fabulous in this work. Grimm\r\nalso agrees with Gruner in condemning it as spurious; but Littré shows\r\ngood reasons for admitting it into the list of genuine productions. He\r\nreplies in a very satisfactory manner to Gruner’s objections. Thus he\r\nshows, in particular, what we have adverted to previously, that the\r\nknowledge of anatomy which was possessed in the Hippocratic age, had\r\nbeen much underrated by Gruner and others, and that the two passages in\r\nwhich the Amazons are supposed to be referred to, are not parallel, and\r\ndo not admit of a comparison. He also very properly insists upon it, as\r\na strong argument in favor of the genuineness of this treatise, that it\r\nhad been commented upon by Ctesias.[142] The work, indeed, contains so\r\nmuch valuable matter, of which subsequent authors (as Celsus and Paulus\r\nÆgineta) have freely availed themselves, in handling the subjects which\r\nare treated of in it, that I have every disposition to receive it as\r\ngenuine. We shall see, afterwards, that, taken in connection with the\r\nnext work, it is a perfect masterpiece on the subject of Fractures and\r\nDislocations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   VIII. Περὶ ἀγμῶν--_On Fractures_.\r\n\r\nTried by the tests laid down by us above, this treatise must\r\nundoubtedly be received as genuine. It is decidedly acknowledged as\r\nsuch by Palladius, Erotian, Galen, and, in short, by all the ancient\r\nauthorities, and the only modern critics who venture to question its\r\nclaim are Grimm, the German translator of Hippocrates, and Kühn; and,\r\nin fact, the latter does so merely in deference to Grimm, for his\r\narguments on the question of its authenticity all tell the other way.\r\nThat the treatises “On Fractures” and “On Articulations” constituted\r\noriginally one work, is shown in a very convincing manner by Galen,\r\nin his introductory comment on the latter.[143] This is an additional\r\nreason for admitting the work “On Articulations” as genuine. Indeed,\r\nI do not hesitate to declare that whoever refuses to admit these two\r\ntreatises as genuine, may consistently dispute the claims of any other\r\nwork of the same date.\r\n\r\n\r\n           IX. Μοχλικός--_On the Instruments of Reduction_.\r\n\r\nThis work is quoted by Galen as one of the acknowledged books of\r\nHippocrates,[144] and is admitted by Erotian into his list of genuine\r\nworks; nay, it appears from the latter that it had been commented upon\r\nby Bacchius. Of the modern authorities, Foës and Littré concur with\r\nthe ancient in admitting its claims, but it is rejected by Lemos,\r\nMercuriali, Haller, Gruner, Grimm, and Kühn. No one who reads it\r\ncarefully can fail to remark that, as stated by Galen,[145] it is a\r\ncompendium of the work “On the Articulations,” so that whoever admits\r\nthe latter to be genuine must acknowledge the treatise now under\r\nconsideration to be one which embodies the opinions of Hippocrates,\r\nwhether it were actually composed by him or not. Taking all this into\r\naccount, it appears to me superfluous diligence in modern critics to\r\nsearch out grounds for questioning its authenticity.\r\n\r\n\r\n      X. Περὶ τῶν ἐν κεφαλῇ τρωμάτων--_On Injuries of the Head_.\r\n\r\nThis work is acknowledged as genuine by all the authorities, ancient\r\nand modern. The only objection to its genuineness is the appearance of\r\ncertain interpolations towards the end of it.[146] This, however, as we\r\nhave remarked above (No. III.), is a mode of vitiation from which few\r\nancient works are altogether exempt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XI. Ὂρκος--_The Oath_.\r\n\r\nThis interesting little piece is quoted as genuine by Erotian,[147]\r\nTheodore Priscian,[148] Soranus Ephesius,[149] St. Jerome,[150]\r\nGregory Nazianzen,[151] Suidas,[152] and Scribonius Largus.[153] It\r\nis also received as such by Foës, Gruner, and Littré, but is rejected\r\nby Mercuriali, Schulze, Haller, Kühn, Ackerman, and other modern\r\nauthorities, as quoted by Ackerman. The only reasonable grounds which I\r\ncan see for questioning its authenticity is the silence of Galen with\r\nregard to it; but when we take into account that Galen has nowhere\r\ngiven an entire list of what he considers to be the genuine works of\r\nHippocrates, this omission on his part may be merely incidental, and\r\nis not of much weight. On the other hand, the argument which M. Littré\r\nseeks to establish in favor of its authenticity on fancied allusions\r\nto it by Aristophanes[154] and Plato,[155] appears to me to have no\r\nweight; indeed, he himself gives up the former in another place.[156]\r\n\r\nI have met with the following English translations of this piece, and\r\nno doubt there may be others:\r\n\r\n    “The Protestation which Hippocrates caused his Scholars to\r\n    make, by Peter Low; Lond. 1597.”\r\n\r\n    “----, by Francis Clifton, M.D.; Lond. 1734.”\r\n\r\nThe translation by Low is in a quaint and antiquated style; that by\r\nClifton is carefully done.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        XII. Νόμος--_The Law_.\r\n\r\nThis little piece is noticed by Erotian, and admitted as genuine\r\nby M. Littré, but Mercuriali, Gruner, Ackerman, Kühn, and Greenhill\r\nincline to reject it. It is well written, but the style is rather too\r\nscholastic for the age and taste of the great Father of Medicine. At\r\nthe same time, it has so many points of accordance with “The Oath,”\r\nthat it seems inconsistent to admit the one as authentic and reject the\r\nother as spurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n                XIII. Κατ' ἰητρεῖον--_On the Surgery_.\r\n\r\nAll the ancient commentators which have come down to us, such as\r\nErotian, Galen, and Palladius, admit it to be genuine; but it would\r\nappear from Galen that some of the older commentators were not\r\nsatisfied upon this point, some doubting whether it was the production\r\nof the great Hippocrates or of Thessalus, and some referring it to\r\nHippocrates, the son of Gnosidicus.[157] It is received also by Foës,\r\nGruner, and, after a good deal of hesitation, by M. Littré. Schulze\r\nexpresses himself on this point doubtfully,[158] and the work is\r\nrejected by Grimm, Ackerman, and Kühn. Beyond all doubt, it is a\r\ncompendium of the treatises “On Fractures” and “On the Articulations,”\r\nso that, whether the composition of Hippocrates himself or not, there\r\ncan be no question that the subject-matter of it is derived from him.\r\nGalen appears to have been remarkably fond of this treatise, and\r\nmakes frequent reference to it in his great work “On the Dogmata of\r\nHippocrates and Plato.” It would appear that Diocles, Philotimus, and\r\nMantias had written treatises bearing the same title.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in determining accurately what was the nature\r\nof the ancient _Iatrium_ ιητρεῖον. See an interesting disquisition\r\non this subject in Littré’s edition of Hippocrates, t. v., p. 25. It\r\nmost probably was an establishment kept by the physician, in which\r\nwere contained not only all sorts of medicines, but also all kinds of\r\nsurgical apparatus. Mention of the _Iatrium_ is made by Plato\r\n(Legg. iv., p. 720, and i., p. 646; ed. Tauch.) Aristotle is said to\r\nhave possessed an _Iatrium_, which, if the story be true, he had\r\nno doubt acquired from his father, who was a medical practitioner.[159]\r\nFrom what is stated by Plato, it would appear that the assistants\r\nwere qualified to administer professional assistance in the absence\r\nof their superior, and were also called doctors. (Legg. iv.) So it\r\nappears that the modern abuse of this title was sanctioned by classical\r\nusage! It must be recollected that, in the time of Hippocrates, eminent\r\nphysicians were _periodeutæ_, that is to say, wanderers from\r\nplace to place, and consequently they would stand in need of such\r\nan establishment as we have described the _Iatrium_ to be. See\r\nfurther the Argument to this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n          XIV. Περὶ φύσεως ἀνθρώπου--_On the Nature of Man_.\r\n\r\nErotian, Galen, Palladius, and Macrobius[160] do not hesitate to\r\nquote the doctrines contained in this treatise as being those of the\r\ngreat Hippocrates, but its authenticity has long been considered\r\nvery questionable, owing to the circumstance that a passage in it of\r\nconsiderable length, relative to the anatomy of the venous system, is\r\nquoted by Aristotle[161] as being the production of Polybus, and it\r\nis accordingly received as such by Haller,[162] Gruner, Littré, and\r\nmost of our recent authorities on ancient medicine. Galen, however,\r\ncontends that the passage quoted by Aristotle is not the work either\r\nof Hippocrates or of Polybus, but an interpolation, and that the rest\r\nof the treatise is genuine.[163] But Galen, at the same time, admits\r\nthat Dioscorides, the Commentator (he must not be confounded with\r\nthe celebrated author of the Materia Medica), had marked the first\r\npart of this treatise with the sign of the obelisk, as indicating his\r\nsuspicion of its being spurious, and that he held it to be the work\r\nof Hippocrates, the son of Thessalus, that is to say, of a grandson\r\nof the great Hippocrates. But, whatever may be decided regarding its\r\nauthorship, a careful perusal of the treatise will satisfy any one that\r\nit is a piece of patchwork; made up of several fragments, which do not\r\ncohere properly together. It certainly also appears to me that many of\r\nthe philosophical dogmata which are delivered in it do not accord well\r\nwith the doctrines contained in those treatises which are universally\r\nadmitted to be genuine.\r\n\r\nAfter alluding briefly to the opinions of those philosophers who held\r\nthat the human body is formed from the four elements, that is to say,\r\nfire, air, water, and earth, the writer proceeds to state his own\r\ndoctrines regarding the four humors, namely, blood, phlegm, yellow and\r\nblack bile, and the diseases which are occasioned by the prevalence of\r\none or other of them, according to the seasons of the year, and other\r\ncircumstances. The doctrines, as herein stated, are very hypothetical,\r\nand certainly, as already hinted, not in accordance with those\r\ndelivered in the genuine works. It is proper to mention, however,\r\nthat Galen, in several parts of his works, makes Hippocrates to be\r\nthe author of the theories of the elements and of the humors.[164]\r\nThe treatise contains certain general truths and rules of practice\r\nnot unworthy of some consideration, such as this, that diseases are\r\ncured by their contraries, that is to say, that diseases arising from\r\nrepletion are removed by evacuation, and _vice versa_; and that\r\ndiseases in general are occasioned either by the food we eat, or the\r\nair we breathe, those which prevail epidemically being produced by the\r\nlatter cause. All sudden changes of diet are held to be attended with\r\ndanger, and to be avoided. It is also an important rule of practice\r\nthat, in venesection, blood should be abstracted from a part as\r\ndistant as possible from the seat of the pain and of the collection\r\nof blood. There can be no doubt, in a word, as we have stated in the\r\npreceding section, on the authority of Galen, that Hippocrates was\r\nwell acquainted with the principle of revulsion in the practice of\r\nmedicine. The natural heat, or, as it is now called, the animal heat,\r\nis stated to be greater the younger the body is--a physiological\r\ndoctrine strenuously advocated by Galen in several parts of his works,\r\nbut more especially in the treatise “Against Lycus.”[165] The theory\r\nof the formation of urinary calculi is also discussed. The same occurs\r\nin the treatise “De Aëre,” etc., and in the work “De Morbis” (iv.,\r\n28). Allusion is likewise made to the occurrence of substances in the\r\nurine resembling hairs.[166] The last fragment of which this treatise\r\nis composed relates to fevers, the greater part of which are held to be\r\noccasioned by bile. It is said that there are four varieties of them,\r\nnamely, synochus, quotidian, tertian and quartan; that the synochus\r\nis formed from the most intense bile, and comes soonest to a crisis,\r\nand the others in the order we have stated them. This is very unlike\r\nthe doctrines of fever laid down in the genuine works, and accordingly\r\nthis portion of the treatise was a great stumbling-block to those among\r\nthe ancient commentators who contended for the genuineness of the\r\ntreatise.[167] Altogether, then, I must say, that a careful perusal\r\nof the work leads me to the conclusion that, notwithstanding the high\r\nauthorities in its favor, it does not deserve to be received as a\r\ngenuine production of Hippocrates.[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n            XV. Περὶ διαίτης ὑγιεινῆς--_On Diet in Health_.\r\n\r\nThis work is passed over unnoticed by Palladius and Erotian; and\r\nGalen, although he wrote a commentary on it which still remains,\r\ninforms us that some of the elder commentators had assigned it to\r\nPolybus, the son-in-law to Hippocrates.[169] He further mentions\r\nthat it had been variously referred to Euryphon, Phaon, Philistion,\r\nand others; ancient authority in its favor is, therefore, very\r\nequivocal. The modern critics are pretty unanimous in rejecting it;\r\nindeed, Littré, improving on the hint cast out by Galen, does not\r\nscruple to refer it and the preceding treatise to Polybus. Though\r\nthe subject-matters of it are not, in the main, of much importance,\r\nit contains some directions for the regulation of the diet, which\r\nare by no means injudicious. One of his directions, with regard to\r\nclothing, is very different, however, from what we might have expected,\r\nconsidering the fondness of the ancients for the use of oil to\r\ncounteract the effects of cold.[170] The author of this work directs\r\noily garments to be used in summer, but clean ones in winter. Emetics\r\nare recommended to be taken by persons of a gross habit of body, but to\r\nbe avoided by those who are slender. This rule is expressed by Celsus\r\nin the following terms: “Vomitus inutilis gracilibus et imbecillum\r\nstomachum habentibus, utilis plenis et biliosis omnibus, si vel nimium\r\nse repleverint vel parum concoxerint.”[171] The author of this treatise\r\nrecommends hyssop as an emetic, and we find its use in this way not\r\ninfrequently noticed in the Hippocratic treatises, but not in the works\r\nof subsequent authorities, as far as I am aware. The work concludes\r\nwith a passage on diseases of the brain, which also occurs, “De Morbis”\r\n(ii.), and seems much out of place here. It is said that they are first\r\nmanifested by stupor of the head, frequent passing of urine, and other\r\nsymptoms of strangury; and it is added, that a discharge of water or of\r\nmucus by the nose or ears relieves these complaints.\r\n\r\nAltogether, considering how slender the evidence is, both external and\r\ninternal, in favor of the authenticity of this treatise, I can have no\r\nhesitation in rejecting it as spurious.\r\n\r\n\r\n          XVI. Προρῥητικον, α’--_First Book of Prorrhetics_.\r\n\r\n             XVII. Κωακὰι προγνώσεις--_Coan Prognostics_.\r\n\r\nThese two works are so evidently allied to one another, that I have\r\njudged it expedient to treat of them together. The greatest difference\r\nof opinion has prevailed among the critics, both ancient and modern,\r\nwith regard to them. Erotian declares expressly that the “Prorrhetics,”\r\nboth first and second, are not genuine; and Galen, although he writes\r\na commentary on the first book, complains of the difficulty he\r\nexperienced in explaining certain vocables of dubious meaning contained\r\nin it,[172] and elsewhere states that the treatise is composed of\r\nextracts from the “Prognostics,” “Epidemics,” and “Aphorisms.” Foës\r\nis almost the only modern scholar of any note who stands up for the\r\ngenuineness of the first book of the “Prorrhetics;” and it is decidedly\r\nrejected by Grimm, Ackerman, Haller, Littré and nearly all the other\r\nmodern authorities. The “Coacæ Prænotiones” have very little ancient\r\nauthority in their favor, and even Foës rejects the work with greater\r\ndisdain than it would seem to merit. Of late years, the opinion has\r\ngained pretty general assent that these two treatises are more ancient\r\nthan the days of Hippocrates;[173] that, in fact, they constitute\r\nthe materials out of which he composed the “Prognostics,” and are\r\nthe results of the observations made by the priest-physicians in the\r\nAsclepion, or Temple of Health, at Cos. This idea is followed out with\r\ngreat ability by Dr. Ermerius, in his “Specimen Historico-Medicum\r\nInaugurale de Hippocratis doctrina a Prognostice oriunda,” where, by\r\na most ingenious and convincing process of comparison, he appears\r\nclearly to make out that the “Coacæ Prænotiones” are formed from\r\nthe first book of the “Prorrhetica,” and the “Prognostics” from the\r\n“Coacæ Prænotiones.” These positions, I repeat, he seems to me to have\r\nestablished most satisfactorily, and I cannot hesitate to declare it\r\nas my opinion that Dr. Ermerius has thereby thrown great light on\r\nthis department of the Hippocratic literature. M. Littré has justly\r\nappreciated the labors of Dr. Ermerius, and adopted his views without\r\nreserve. (v. i., p. 351.) As I shall have occasion to compare the\r\ncontents of these two treatises now under consideration with the\r\nsubject-matters of the “Prognostics” in my Argument to the latter, I\r\nshall confine myself at present to a few observations, selected in a\r\ngood measure from M. Littré’s argument to the “Coacæ Prænotiones.”\r\n\r\nIn the first place, M. Littré makes some interesting remarks on\r\nvomicæ of the chest after pneumonia and pleurisy; but this subject\r\nwill come to be treated of in the notes on the “Prognostics.” He next\r\ngives some important observations on the following passage in the\r\n“Coacæ Prænotiones,” § 418: “All sprains are troublesome, and cause\r\nintense pains at the commencement, and in certain cases occasion\r\nafter-consequences; the most troublesome are those about the breast,\r\nand the most dangerous are those in which there is vomiting of blood,\r\nmuch fever, and pain about the mammæ, chest, and back; when all these\r\noccur, the patients quickly die; but in those cases in which they\r\ndo not all occur, nor are severe, they are longer protracted; the\r\ninflammation at farthest is protracted to forty days.” He relates,\r\nin illustration of this passage, a case very much in point, from the\r\n“Journal de Médecine,” Juillet, 1843, of a healthy person who, in\r\nlifting a log of wood, strained the parts about the chest so as to\r\nexperience a cracking sensation about the breast; it was followed by\r\nintense inflammation, which, in spite of plentiful depletion, ended in\r\nan empyema which opened by the fifth intervertebral space. The patient\r\nrecovered. This case is a good illustration of a species of accident\r\nfrequently described in the Hippocratic Collection. He then briefly\r\nconsiders the question whether or not Hippocrates was acquainted with\r\n_the croup_, on which he does not give any decided opinion. In\r\nmy opinion, the term _croup_ is now used in a vague sense, being\r\napplied to cases of angina, in which the inflammation spreads down to\r\nthe glottis and trachea, and also to cases of bronchitis attended with\r\na croupy cough. I am confident that pure _cynanche trachealis_,\r\nthat is to say, acute disease originating in the trachea, is of very\r\nrare occurrence, at least, it certainly is so in the north of Scotland.\r\nThat the ancients were well acquainted with that species of cynanche in\r\nwhich the disease spreads down to the windpipe there can be no doubt.\r\nSee the Commentary on §§ 26, 27, Book III., of PAULUS ÆGINETA.\r\nIt may reasonably be doubted whether they were not fully as well\r\nacquainted with diseases of the fauces and windpipe as the moderns are.\r\n\r\nM. Littré’s observations on sphacelus of the brain do not at all accord\r\nwith the opinions of Dr. Coray,[174] nor with those advanced in the\r\nCommentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., § 7. He thinks that\r\nHippocrates meant by it necrosis of the cranium. Although I still so\r\nfar adhere to my former opinion that by sphacelus was generally meant\r\n_ramollissement_ of the brain, I must admit that some of the\r\npassages in the Hippocratic Collection, where it is described, would\r\nbear out M. Littré’s ideas regarding it. On the subject of sphacelus,\r\nsee “De Morbis,” near the beginning.\r\n\r\nM. Littré draws, from a variety of sources, much interesting matter\r\nin illustration of § 500 of the “Coacæ Prænotiones:” “Amaurosis is\r\nproduced by wounds in the eyelash, and a little above it; the more\r\nrecent the wound, they see the better; but when the cicatrix becomes\r\nolder the amaurosis increases.” Plattner[175] held that in this case\r\nthe amaurosis is connected with lesion of the frontal nerve. Beer[176]\r\nshows that the affection of the sight is not connected with injury\r\nof the nerve, but is rather the result of concussion of the ball of\r\nthe eye. Walker, and Littré himself, are rather disposed to question\r\naltogether the truth of the statement made by Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nM. Littré concludes his argument with some observations on the\r\nlethargus of the ancients, which he holds, and correctly, as I think,\r\nto be a pseudo-continual fever. My own opinion, as delivered in the\r\nCommentary on Book III., § 9, of PAULUS ÆGINETA, will be\r\nfound to be very similar. Lethargus is there stated to have been a\r\nspecies of remittent fever, resembling the causus. M. Littré, further\r\nin illustration of this subject, gives from the works of Mr. R. Clark,\r\nan English physician at Sierra Leone, an interesting account of a\r\nsleepy-dropsy, to which the Negroes there are subject.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the contents of these treatises are mixed up by\r\nClifton with his translation of the “Prognostics;” and Moffat gives a\r\ncomplete translation of this book of the “Prorrhetics.” The latter,\r\nlike all the other translations by the same hand, is utterly worthless.\r\nClifton is only culpable for having introduced confusion into the\r\ncontents of works which had been so admirably arranged by Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n       XVIII. Προῤῥητικόν, β’--_The Second Book of Prorrhetics_.\r\n\r\nThe reception which this work has met with from the critics, ancient\r\nand modern, appears rather singular. Erotian and Galen, who, in\r\ngeneral, are too facile in admitting the claims of suspected works,\r\nin the present instance reject a work which many modern authorities\r\nacknowledge as genuine; as, for example, Haller, Gruner, Grimm, and,\r\nwith certain qualifications, Ackerman and Kühn. I must say, however,\r\nwith Foës, Littré, and Greenhill, that I cannot see how we can\r\nconsistently recognize as genuine a work which has so large an amount\r\nof ancient authority against it, and none in its favor. At the same\r\ntime, all must admit that the treatise in question contains nothing\r\nunworthy of the name of Hippocrates, and that, if estimated by the\r\nvalue of its contents, it is one of the most important works in the\r\nwhole Collection. I will, therefore, give an abstract of its contents,\r\nalong with my translation of the “Prognostics.” It is deserving of much\r\nattention, as being the only work we possess which gives us an insight\r\ninto the method taken by the ancient physicians to gain the confidence\r\nof their patients by their mode of conducting the preliminary\r\nexamination of every case. In my younger days I knew an old physician,\r\nwho was an adept in this art of conciliating the confidence of his\r\npatients by anticipating their histories of their own complaints.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XIX. Περὶ ἑλκῶν--_On Ulcers_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise is decidedly admitted as genuine by Galen,[177] Erotian,\r\nCelsus, and by Foës, Lemos, Mercuriali, Schulze,[178] and Vidus\r\nVidius,[179] but is rejected by Haller, Gruner, Ackerman, and Kühn,\r\non internal evidence, the nature of which we shall presently examine.\r\nM. Littré in so far concurs in the judgment of the authorities who\r\nreject it, although he does not admit the grounds of their decision.\r\nGruner’s principal, indeed I may say his sole, argument against the\r\nauthenticity of this work is founded on the nature of the substances\r\nrecommended by the author for the treatment of ulcers; namely, such\r\nacrid and (as Gruner chooses to call them) _absurd_ medicines as\r\narsenic, black hellebore, and cantharides. But how does it appear that\r\nthese are “absurd” applications to ulcers, when even at the present\r\nday the two strongest of them, namely, arsenic and cantharides, are\r\nthe means often resorted to for the cure of indolent and malignant\r\nulcers? The same articles are recommended by Celsus (v.), and by Paulus\r\nÆgineta.[180] It is true that the titles given to certain of the\r\nprescriptions contained in this treatise are not appropriate, such as\r\n_emollient_ (μαλθακώδεα), applied to applications which contain\r\nmany acrid ingredients. But in this case, as is remarked by Foës, we\r\nshould consider the text to be in so far corrupt, for certainly this\r\ndoes not constitute a legitimate reason for rejecting the treatise\r\n_in toto_.\r\n\r\nVidus Vidius, in his interesting commentary on this work, mentions,\r\nas a proof of its authenticity, that most of the principles laid down\r\nby Galen for the treatment of ulcers, are taken from this part of the\r\nworks of Hippocrates. In a word, agreeably to the rules laid down by me\r\nfor testing the authenticity of these treatises, I do not see that I am\r\nwarranted in refusing to admit the claims of this work to be considered\r\ngenuine. I hold myself bound, therefore, to give a translation of it.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper in this place to mention that the term ulcer (ἕλκος)\r\nis used in this treatise to signify both a wound inflicted by an\r\nexternal body, and a solution of continuity from any internal cause.\r\nThis usage of the word is sanctioned by the older poets, as, for\r\nexample, Homer (Iliad, ii., 723; Ib., xiv., 130); Pindar (Nem., viii.,\r\n50; Pyth., iii., 84); and Bion (Adonis).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XX. Περὶ συρίγγων--_On Fistulæ_.\r\n\r\nThough this work be acknowledged as genuine by Erotian, Dioscorides,\r\nCelsus, Paulus Ægineta, and by Foës and Vidus Vidius, it is set down\r\nfor spurious by Haller, Gruner, and Ackerman; and even by Littré and\r\nGreenhill its claims are not fully recognized. I can see no good\r\nreason, however, for rejecting it, since, as I have stated, the ancient\r\nauthority in favor of it is very strong, and I can detect nothing\r\nin the doctrines and rules of practice delivered in it which are at\r\nvariance with those laid down in the treatises which all admit to be\r\ngenuine. Ackerman, indeed, pretends that the theory of bile and phlegm,\r\nas being the cause of disease, does not belong to Hippocrates or his\r\nschool. But this is evidently begging the question; and, moreover,\r\nGalen, who must be admitted to be a high authority in such a case,\r\ndecidedly holds Hippocrates to be the author of the Theory of the\r\nHumors.[181] Galen seems to say that this treatise, and the following\r\none on hemorrhoids, constituted one work in his time; and he does not\r\nthrow out the slightest suspicion against the genuineness of either, as\r\nthe words of Ackerman would lead one to suppose.[182]\r\n\r\nVidus Vidius, although he acknowledges Hippocrates as the author of\r\nthis work, holds that it had not been published by him, but had been\r\nleft in an unfinished state. The argument, however, which he uses in\r\nproof of this opinion, is by no means convincing; he contends that the\r\npart which relates to inflammation of the anus is quite out of place in\r\na work devoted to the consideration of fistulæ. But few who have much\r\npractical acquaintance with the subject will agree with him on this\r\npoint, for it is well known that fistulæ, for the most part, originate\r\nin inflammation and abscess about the verge of the anus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXI. Περὶ αἱμοῤῥοιδων--_On Piles_.\r\n\r\nThis little tract has experienced the same reception from the critics\r\nas the preceding one, that is to say, it is acknowledged as genuine\r\nby ErotianΠερὶ αἱμοῤῥοιδων and Galen, and by Foës and Vidus Vidius,\r\nbut is decidedly rejected as such by Mercuriali, Gruner, Grimm, and\r\nAckerman. I can remark nothing in it, however, which appears to me at\r\nall inconsistent with the doctrines contained in the genuine works,\r\nunless it be that in this tract the author appears to direct that in\r\noperating upon hemorrhoids they should be all extirpated, whereas in\r\none of his Aphorisms, which is quoted by Paulus Ægineta, in his chapter\r\non this subject, he recommends that one should be left, as an outlet\r\nto the superfluous blood. (vi., 79.) I do not know how this divergence\r\nof opinion is to be explained, but, at all events, such an apparent\r\ncontradiction would not warrant us in rejecting the treatise altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n           XXII. Περὶ ίερῆς νούσου--_On the Sacred Disease_.\r\n\r\nThis work is acknowledged as genuine by Erotian, Galen,[183] and\r\nCælius Aurelianus,[184] but is rejected by Lemos, Mercuriali, Haller,\r\nGruner, Ackerman, Kühn, and even by M. Littré, although the last of\r\nthese admits that the grounds upon which it had been refused a place\r\namong the genuine works are very equivocal. I feel very much at a\r\nloss what to decide with regard to it. It is unquestionably the work\r\nof a man possessed of a highly cultivated mind, free from the popular\r\nsuperstition of his age, and familiarly acquainted with comparative\r\nanatomy, and having no contemptible knowledge of human physiology.\r\nThere is, in fact, no name, whether in ancient or modern times, to\r\nwhich it might not do honor. That it is not unworthy, then, of the\r\ngreat Hippocrates, all must allow, but whether or not he be the actual\r\nauthor of it, there is much difficulty in determining satisfactorily.\r\nThat, in certain respects, it is very unlike his other works, must\r\nbe admitted; the talent which it displays is more of a reflective\r\nthan of a perceptive nature, which is the reverse of the common\r\ncharacter of Hippocrates, who, in his genuine works, evidently evinces\r\na disposition to trust to accurate observation rather than to acute\r\nratiocination. The style, too, I must admit, is more diffuse than the\r\ntrue Hippocratic style generally is. All this might, no doubt, be\r\naccounted for, upon the supposition that the work was addressed to the\r\ngeneral reader, and not to the professional. Other reasons might be\r\nimagined, to account for the diversity of style and matter, but these\r\nI shall not occupy time in discussing, as I have decided upon giving a\r\ntranslation of it, so that the English reader may be enabled to judge\r\nfor himself as to its genuineness. Whether the tract in question be the\r\nwork of Hippocrates, or, as some have supposed, of his philosophical\r\nfriend Democritus,[185] there can be little or no doubt that it is a\r\nproduction of that age, for it appears to me that their contemporary,\r\nPlato, has evidently made reference to it. Thus, in that portion\r\nof his “Timæus” which treats of the causes of diseases, he clearly\r\nseems, in accounting for epilepsy, to have had in view the doctrines\r\ncontained in this treatise. For although he uses the term “sacred\r\ndisease,” and applies “most divine,” as an epithet to the cavities\r\n(_ventricles_?) of the head, he still, in imitation of the author\r\nof this work, accounts for the disease upon natural causes, that is to\r\nsay, from derangements of the pneuma and phlegm.[186]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XXIII. Περὶ φυσὠν--_On Airs_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise deserves, in many respects, to be put in the same\r\ncategory as the last; that is to say, it is generally admitted by\r\nthe ancient authorities, but rejected by the modern. Thus it is\r\nnoticed as genuine by Erotian and Galen, and by Gregory Nazianzen and\r\nStobæus.[187] On the other hand Mercuriali, Le Clerc,[188] Haller,\r\nGruner, Ackerman, and Kühn reject it. M. Littré, also, in deference\r\nto the opinion of later critics, refuses it a place in his list of\r\ngenuine works, but, at the same time, expresses himself doubtfully on\r\nthis point. Le Clerc, although, as we have stated, he inclines to the\r\nopinion of those who reject it, does not hesitate to declare, “that\r\nthis book, upon reading it, seems to be one of the most rational and\r\ncoherent of all Hippocrates’s works.” And I in so far agree with Le\r\nClerc, that the contents of it are of great importance for the right\r\nunderstanding of the ancient theory of medicine, whether we refer the\r\ntract in question to Hippocrates or not. I shall now give a summary of\r\nthe doctrines contained in it, which I must say appear to me to smack\r\nrather of the school of philosophy, than of the practical good sense\r\nfor which the author of the First and Third Epidemics, and of the\r\nPrognostics, is so remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe author sets out with stating “that there are certain arts\r\nwhich are of laborious acquisition, but are profitable to those who\r\npractise them; of general utility to the common people, but painful to\r\nthose who exercise them. Of such a nature is the art of medicine. The\r\nphysician contemplates dreadful things (δεινὰ), comes in contact with\r\nwhat are unpleasant, and reaps sorrow to himself from the afflictions\r\nof others; but the sick are freed from the greatest evils by the art,\r\nnamely, from diseases, pains, sorrow, and death; for medicine has been\r\nfound decidedly to be a cure for all these. In the manual parts of\r\nmedicine (surgery) practice is necessary. For in all that relates to\r\nmanipulation, usage is the best teacher. But with regard to the most\r\nobscure and difficult diseases, a judgment is to be formed rather from\r\nopinion than art; and it is in such cases that experience differs\r\nmuch from inexperience. And it is a most important consideration to\r\ndetermine what is the cause of diseases, and what the beginning and\r\nfountain-head, as it were, of the evils in the body; for if one be\r\nacquainted with the cause of the disease, he may be able to apply the\r\nsuitable remedies to the affections of the body, judging of diseases\r\nfrom their contraries: for this mode of cure is that which is most\r\nin accordance with nature. Thus, for example, hunger is a disease;\r\nfor whatever afflicts man is called a disease. What, then, is the\r\ncure of hunger? Whatever will allay hunger, that is to say, food,\r\nand by it the other is to be cured. Again, drink cures thirst; and,\r\nmoreover, evacuation cures repletion, and repletion evacuation, and\r\nrest labor, and labor rest; and, in a word, _the contraries are\r\nthe cure of contraries_. For medicine consists of addition and\r\nsubtraction--the subtraction of what is redundant, and the addition\r\nof what is deficient. And he that does these things best, is the best\r\nphysician; and he that is most removed from this system, is the most\r\nremoved from a knowledge of the art. The manner of all diseases is the\r\nsame, but they differ in place; and hence diseases appear to have no\r\nresemblance to one another, owing to the diversity and dissimilarity\r\nof situations. For there is but one form (ἰδίη) of all disease, and\r\nthe cause is the same. What that is I will attempt to explain in\r\nthe following discourse. The bodies of men and of other animals are\r\nnourished by three kinds of aliment, namely, food, drink, and airs;\r\nand those winds in the body are called spirits, which are named airs\r\nout of it. This it is which exercises the greatest power over the\r\nsymptoms, and it is worth while to attend to the power of it; for the\r\nwind is a current and stream of air. When, then, much air makes a\r\nstrong current, trees are torn from their roots by the force of the\r\nblast, and the sea is raised in billows, and ships of immense size are\r\ntossed aloft. Such power it possesses, and yet it is invisible to the\r\nsight, and is manifest only to the understanding. And what would there\r\nbe without it, and from what thing is it absent? and with what is it\r\nnot present? For the whole space between the earth and heaven is full\r\nof air, and it is the cause of winter and of summer; in winter becoming\r\ncondensed and cold, and in summer mild and tranquil. The path also of\r\nthe sun, moon, and stars is through air--for air is the pabulum of\r\nfire, and fire deprived of air could not live.... And with regard to\r\nthe sea, that it contains a portion of air is obvious to everybody.\r\nFor water-animals could not exist if they did not participate in the\r\nair; and how could they participate in it otherwise, except by means\r\nof the water, and by drawing in the air along with it. And the moon’s\r\nfoundation is upon it, and this it is which supports the earth,[189]\r\nand nothing is void of it. And why the air is possessed of such power\r\nin other things has been now stated; but in men this is the cause of\r\nlife, and of disease to those who are in ill health. And all bodies\r\nstand so much in need of air, that whereas if deprived of everything\r\nelse, such as food and drink, a man may subsist for two, three, or more\r\ndays; if the passage of air into the body be stopped, he will perish in\r\na short part of a day, so necessary is air to the body. And, besides,\r\nthere is some intermission of every other operation which men perform,\r\nfor life is full of change; but this operation alone living animals\r\nperform incessantly, sometimes inspiring, and sometimes expiring. That\r\nall living animals, then, are closely connected with air has now been\r\nshown. After this we must forthwith declare what infirmities probably\r\narise in an especial manner from this source--when it is redundant\r\nor deficient in quantity, or when polluted with morbific miasmata it\r\nenters the body. That diseases are the offspring of air I will show\r\nfrom the most common of all diseases, I mean, fever; for this disease\r\naccompanies all others, and most especially inflammations. This is well\r\nillustrated by the accidents which befall the feet; for along with the\r\ninflammation a bubo and fever speedily supervene. There are two kinds\r\nof fever (that I may touch upon that subject); the one common to all,\r\nwhich is called the plague, and the other being connected with vitiated\r\nfood in those who use it. The air, then, is the cause of both these.\r\nA common fever (epidemic?) therefore is such, because all draw in the\r\nsame breath (pneuma).” The author afterwards attempts an explanation\r\nof the phenomena of rigors, which, however, is not very intelligible,\r\nand then of the febrile heat and sweats which succeed them. The latter\r\nhe compares to the condensed steam of boiling-water. He afterwards\r\nproceeds to explain that when the blood is mixed up with vitiated air\r\n(gases?), it occasions diseases in various parts of the body; for\r\nexample, pain in the eyes, when it fixes there; when in the ears, the\r\ndisease is seated there; when in the nose, coryza is the consequence;\r\nand when in the chest, branchus (bronchitis?), and so forth. To the\r\nsame cause he ascribes the origin of dropsy, namely, to the prevalence\r\nof airs, and the melting down of the flesh. He also accounts for the\r\nformation of apoplexy, by supposing that it arises from the flesh of\r\nthe parts being filled up with gases; and in the same way he explains\r\nthe origin of epilepsy very elaborately, and most ingeniously, but\r\nat too great length to suit my limits in this place. Altogether the\r\ntreatise is one of the most interesting pieces of medical philosophy\r\nwhich has come down to us from antiquity. It shows very decidedly what\r\na talent for dealing with abstract ideas the ancient Greeks were endued\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n      XXIV. Περὶ τόπων τῶν κατ’ ἄνθρωπον--_On the Places in Man_.\r\n\r\nThe ancient authority in favor of this treatise is pretty strong. It is\r\nincluded in Erotian’s list, is quoted by Cælius Aurelianus,[190] and\r\nby Ruffus Ephesius,[191] and is incidentally noticed by Galen in two\r\nplaces of his Glossary.[192] That it is further quoted by Athenæus, as\r\nstated by Gruner and Ackerman, would appear to me to be a mistake.[193]\r\nIt is admitted to be genuine by Le Clerc, Schulze, Haller, Triller,\r\nSprengel, Zuinger, Petersen, and others. It is rejected, however, by\r\nLemos, Mercuriali, Duret, Reinsius, Gruner, and Ackerman. M. Littré\r\ndoes not venture to assign it a place among the genuine treatises,\r\nand yet he evidently inclines to the opinion that later critics\r\nhad rejected it on very doubtful grounds, and leaves the question\r\nundecided. The following summary of its contents will show that it is\r\nnot destitute of valuable matter.\r\n\r\nThe author of it commences with announcing this important\r\nphysiological principle, which microscopical observations on the\r\ndevelopment of the chick have amply confirmed: “It appears to me\r\nthat in the body there is no beginning, but that all parts are alike\r\nbeginning and end; for in a described circle no beginning is to be\r\nfound.” He goes on to remark that, in consequence of this, diseases\r\naffect the whole body; that when seated in the dry parts of it they are\r\nmore permanent, but when in the fluid, more changeable: that one part\r\nof the body imparts disease to the other parts, namely, the stomach to\r\nthe head, and the head to the stomach; and that if the very smallest\r\npart of the body suffer, it will impart its suffering to the whole\r\nframe. He afterwards enters into a lengthened anatomical description\r\nof the parts of the body which, although quoted by Galen,[194] and\r\nnot unfavorably noticed by Gruner,[195] cannot now command much\r\ninterest. He then describes seven defluxions from the head, namely, to\r\nthe nose; to the ears; to the eyes; to the chest--producing empyema\r\nand phthisis; to the spine--producing another species of phthisis\r\n(_tabes dorsalis_?); to the fleshy parts--inducing dropsy; and to\r\nthe joints--occasioning ischias and kedmata (_morbus coxarius_?)\r\nAll this seems very hypothetical, and does not appear to savor of the\r\nstrict process of induction which we remark in the genuine treatises\r\nof Hippocrates. When the disease is seated in the head, he directs\r\nnumerous and deep incisions to be made in the scalp, down to the bone.\r\nHe notices pleurisy, and its termination in empyema; the latter, he\r\nfurther remarks, may originate in ruptures (_sprains_?), and in\r\nthis case, on succussion, an undulatory sound may be heard. He also\r\nstates decidedly that empyema forms in phthisical persons, and that,\r\nin their case, too, a sound like that of water in a bladder may be\r\nheard on succussion. The symptoms accompanying empyema are given\r\nvery graphically. He also describes the _tabes dorsalis_. He\r\nafterwards gives the treatment of pleurisy and pneumonia, in which it\r\nis remarkable that no mention is made of venesection, notwithstanding\r\nthat, in the work “On Regimen in Acute Diseases,” Hippocrates\r\nrecommends bleeding _ad deliquium_ in these diseases; and Galen\r\naccounts for his silence respecting venesection in his treatment of\r\nfevers on the supposition that he did not notice it, because he took it\r\nfor granted, as a general rule, that the operation was performed.[196]\r\nThis consideration, as much as any other, inclines me to doubt the\r\nauthenticity of this treatise. Ischiatic disease he directs to be\r\ntreated by cupping-instruments and heating medicines, administered\r\ninternally. Anasarca, in a young person, he treats by scarifications.\r\nIn the brief notice of injuries of the head here introduced, much the\r\nsame views are advocated as in the work on that subject, of which a\r\ntranslation is given in this volume. The treatment of callous ulcers,\r\nas here laid down, is deserving of great attention; “remove the\r\nindurated parts by a septic medicine, and then produce reunion of the\r\nparts.” Every practical surgeon must recognize this as a very sound and\r\nimportant rule of practice.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of suicidal mania appears singular:--“Give the patient\r\na draught made from the root of mandrake, in a smaller dose than will\r\ninduce mania.” He also, in like manner, recommends mandragora in\r\nconvulsions, applied by means of fires lighted around the patient’s\r\nbed. Pains of the head he directs to be treated by opening the veins\r\nof the temples, or by applying the cautery to them. He then insists,\r\nin strong terms, that, under certain circumstances, purgatives will\r\nbind the bowels, and astringents loosen them. And he further makes\r\nthe important remark that, although the general rule of treatment be\r\n“contraria contrariis curantur,” the opposite rule also holds good\r\nin some cases, namely, “similia similibus curantur.” It thus appears\r\nthat the principles of _Allopathy_ and _Homœopathy_ are recognized by\r\nthe author of this treatise. In confirmation of the latter principle,\r\nhe remarks that the same substance which occasions strangury will\r\nalso sometimes cure it, and so also with cough. And further, he\r\nacutely remarks, that warm water, which, when drunk, generally excites\r\nvomiting, will also sometimes put a stop to it by removing its cause.\r\nHe estimates successful and unsuccessful practice according to the\r\nrule whether the treatment was rightly planned or not; for he argues\r\nwhat is done in ignorance cannot be said to be correctly done, even\r\nif the results are favorable. The work concludes with a short passage\r\non the diseases of women, all of which are said to be connected with\r\nthe uterus. We find here the first mention that is anywhere made of\r\nthe globus hystericus; indeed, I do not remember to have met with\r\nthe term in any of the ancient medical works, with the exception of\r\nthe Hippocratic treatises. He recommends fetid things to be applied\r\nto the nose, and aromatic and soothing things to the genital organs.\r\nThe process of fumigating the uterus is fully described; and likewise\r\nsuppositories and pessaries are mentioned. In the treatment of\r\nuterine hemorrhage the rules here laid down are most important. All\r\nheating things, diuretics, and purgatives are to be avoided; the foot\r\nof the patient’s bed is to be raised, and astringent pessaries are\r\nto be introduced. My own opinion of the work may now be given in a\r\nfew words. It undoubtedly contains much valuable matter which would\r\nbe no discredit to Hippocrates, nor to any of the greatest medical\r\nauthorities, whether of ancient or modern times. I desiderate in it,\r\nhowever, a proper unity of design, and think I see too much of a\r\nspeculative disposition to suit with the character of the Coan sage.\r\nThat it is to be referred to the Cnidian school, as suggested by\r\nGruner, seems doubtful; for, as we are informed by Hippocrates himself,\r\nthe Cnidian physicians only gave the most obvious symptoms, while their\r\npractice was very inert, consisting entirely of drastic purgatives,\r\nwhey, and milk, whereas in this work the diagnostic symptoms are more\r\nprofoundly stated then they are in most of the Hippocratic treatises,\r\nand the practice, in many instances, is very bold and decided. The\r\nknife, the actual cautery, the use of strong purgatives and narcotics,\r\nare freely recommended in various diseases. Altogether, then, although\r\nI would hesitate to ascribe the present work to Hippocrates himself,\r\nI must admit myself inclined rather to refer it to the Coan than the\r\nCnidian school. I see no proper data, however, for forming a decided\r\nopinion on this head, more especially as we are but very imperfectly\r\nacquainted with the tenets of the Cnidian school.[197]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XXV. Περὶ τέχνης--_On Art_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise is sustained as genuine by Erotian, and even by one of\r\nthe older commentators, Heraclides of Tarentum, but it is nowhere\r\nnoticed by Galen, and Suidas would appear to refer it to Hippocrates,\r\nthe son of Gnosidicus.[198] Mercuriali, Gruner, Haller, Ackerman, Kühn,\r\nand most of the modern authorities hold it decidedly to be spurious.\r\nFoës and Zuinger, however, do not object to its authenticity; and\r\nLittré, although he excludes it from his list of the genuine works of\r\nHippocrates admits that it is very ancient, and formed a portion of the\r\nCollection from the commencement. To me it appears that it is written\r\nin too subtle and abstract a style to admit the supposition of its\r\nbeing the work of a practical physician like Hippocrates. Although it\r\ncontains a good deal of original thought, there is not much in it which\r\nwould prove interesting to the medical reader of the present day. It\r\nis an elaborate defense of the art of medicine against the attacks of\r\nthose who maintain that it is no art at all, or one of an uncertain\r\nnature. According to the author’s definition, the aim of the physician\r\nshould be to remove the pains of the sick, to blunt the intensity\r\nof diseases, and not to interfere with those that are mastered by\r\ndisease, as knowing that medicine can be of no avail in such a case. In\r\nconclusion, I shall merely remark that the evidence, both internal and\r\nexternal, is against the supposition of its being genuine, but still\r\nthere appears no good reason for doubting that it emanated from the\r\nschool of Cos.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XXVI. Περὶ διαιτης--_On Regimen_.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in favor of this large and interesting work,\r\nunfortunately, is by no means strong. It is passed by unnoticed by\r\nErotian, and Galen expresses himself, in general, regarding the work in\r\nvery equivocal terms, mentioning that some had referred it to Euryphon,\r\nsome to Phaon, others to Philistion, and others, again, to Aristo.[199]\r\nIn other places, however, he expresses himself less unfavorably as to\r\nthe authenticity of the last two books. Haller, Gruner, Ackerman, Kühn,\r\nand, in fact, nearly all the modern authorities, reject it.[200] M.\r\nLittré, although he agrees with them, remarks justly that the work is\r\none of great value, and exhibits many evident traces of conformity with\r\nthe writings which are truly Hippocratic.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the work is as follows: The first book is altogether\r\nmade up of abstract principles, which savor very much of the dogmata\r\nof Heraclitus. Thus, the author of it holds that there are in men,\r\nand in all other animals, two principles, different in power but\r\nconsentaneous in use, namely, fire and water; that these together are\r\nsufficient for all others, and for themselves; that the one contains\r\nthe principle of motion, and the other of nutrition; that these give\r\nrise to the separate existence of seeds and animals, of all varieties,\r\nshapes, and characters; that, in reality, none of those things which\r\nexist either perish or are created, but they are altered by being mixed\r\ntogether and separated from one another, but that men suppose that\r\nthe one passes from Hades to light, and the other again from light\r\nto Hades. In a word, the contents of the first book savor more of\r\nphilosophy than of practical medicine. For example, it is said, “The\r\ntrainers of the athletæ instruct their pupils in this manner--to break\r\nthe law according to law, to commit injustice according to justice; to\r\ndeceive, to steal, to rob, to commit violence, in the most elegant and\r\ndisgraceful manner: he who cannot do these things is bad, he who can\r\ndo them is good; which is a proof of the folly of the many who, when\r\nthey behold these things decide that the one of these is good and the\r\nothers bad. Many wonder, but few are judges. Men going to the market\r\nproceed thus: they deceive one another in buying and selling, he who\r\ndeceives most is admired. They execute these things--they drink and\r\nbecome mad, they run, they wrestle, they fight, they steal, they cheat;\r\nthe one is preferred to all the others. Hypocrites and deceivers!\r\nBefore the spectators they say one thing. and think another.[201] The\r\nsame persons creep out, and they creep in not the same persons; to one\r\nman they say one thing, and do another; the same person not always\r\nthe same--sometimes he has one mind, and sometimes another. In this\r\nmanner all the arts have communion with human nature.” All this is too\r\nfanciful and recondite for the physician of whom Celsus says “primus ex\r\nomnibus memoria dignis ab studio sapientiæ disciplinam hanc separavit.”\r\nIt is clearly the production of a philosopher and not of a practical\r\nphysician, such as we know Hippocrates to have been. The latter part of\r\nthis book, however, is of a more practical nature, and treats of many\r\nthings relating to regimen and dietetics, such as the arrangement of\r\nmeals, of exercises, etc.\r\n\r\nThe second book is a regular work on Dietetics, and exhibits this\r\nbranch of medicine in a more advanced state than might have been\r\nexpected, considering the time it was written. After some preliminary\r\nobservations on climate, which bear a great resemblance to those\r\ncontained in the treatise “On Airs,” etc., the author treats, in a\r\nvery scientific and methodical manner, of the various animal and\r\nvegetable substances which are used as articles of food. It concludes\r\nwith a discussion on certain matters connected with regimen, such\r\nas exercises, baths, sleep, and so forth. Foës remarks that a great\r\nportion of the opinions advanced by Celsus on the head of Dietetics is\r\nborrowed from this book.\r\n\r\nThe third book treats again of various subjects connected with\r\nDietetics, such as exercises, the arrangement of meals, the\r\nadministration of emetics, the use of venery, and the like. It is full\r\nof important matter, but looks like a distinct treatise from the two\r\npreceding books, for one cannot conceive that the author of one work\r\nwould have twice resumed the consideration of the same subject. Le\r\nClerc, with considerable appearance of reason, ascribes the book to\r\nHerodicus, the master of Hippocrates in the gymnastic art.[202]\r\n\r\nAltogether, the work is one of the highest importance in medical\r\nliterature, whether we ascribe it to Hippocrates or not. On this point\r\nthe evidence, both external and internal, we have seen to be very\r\ninconclusive. The most probable conclusion that can be drawn regarding\r\nit is, that the work is a compilation of important documents from a\r\nvariety of sources, but who the compiler was, whether Hippocrates or\r\none of his successors cannot be determined.[203]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXVII. Περὶ ἐνυπνίον--_On Dreams_.\r\n\r\nThis little work is generally admitted to be a continuation of the\r\npreceding one, and consequently stands upon much the same grounds as\r\nregards its authorship.[204] As Le Clerc and Gruner have well remarked,\r\nit is written with much acumen, and evinces great freedom of spirit,\r\nand exemption from popular errors and superstitions. It commences in\r\nthe following strain:\r\n\r\n“He who forms a correct judgment of those signs which occur in sleep,\r\nwill find that they have a great efficacy in all respects; for the mind\r\nis awake when it ministers to the body, being distributed over many\r\nparts; it is not then master of itself, but imparts a certain portion\r\nof its influence to every part of the body, namely, to the senses,\r\nto the hearing, seeing, touch, walking, acting, and to the whole\r\nmanagement of the body, and therefore its cogitations are not then in\r\nits own power. But when the body is at rest, the soul, being in a state\r\nof movement, steals over the organs of the body, manages its own abode,\r\nand itself performs all the actions of the body; for the body, being\r\nasleep, does not perceive, but the soul, being awake, beholds what is\r\nvisible, hears what is audible, walks, touches, is grieved, reflects,\r\nand, in a word, whatever the offices of the soul or body are, all these\r\nthe soul performs in sleep.[205] Whoever, then, knows how to judge of\r\nthese correctly, will find it a great part of wisdom. But with regard\r\nto such dreams as are divine, and prognosticate something, either\r\ngood or evil, to cities, or to a particular people, there are persons\r\nwho have the art of judging of them accurately, without falling into\r\nmistakes. But such affections of the body as the soul prognosticates,\r\nnamely, such as are connected with repletion and evacuation, from\r\nthe excess of customary things or the change of unusual things, on\r\nthese also persons pronounce judgment, and sometimes they succeed,\r\nand sometimes they err, and understand neither how this happens, that\r\nis to say, how it comes that sometimes they are right, and sometimes\r\nthey fall into mistakes; but warning people to be upon their guard\r\nlest some mischief befall them, they do not instruct them how to\r\nguard themselves, but direct them to pray to the gods; and to offer\r\nup prayers is no doubt becoming and good, but while praying to the\r\ngods a man ought also to use his own exertions. With regard to these,\r\nthen, the matter stands thus: Such dreams as represent at night a man’s\r\nactions through the day, and exhibit them in the manner in which they\r\noccur, namely, as performed and justly deliberated, these are good to\r\na man, and prognosticate health, inasmuch as the soul perseveres in\r\nits diurnal cogitations, and is not weighed down by any repletion,\r\nevacuation, or any other external accident. But when the dreams are the\r\nvery opposite to the actions of the day, and when there is a conflict\r\nbetween them--when this happens, I say, it indicates a disorder in the\r\nbody; when the contrast is great, the evil is great, and when the one\r\nis small the other is small also.” For the cure of this state, as being\r\nconnected with repletion, he recommends evacuation by vomiting, active\r\nexercise, and a restricted diet. The author of the treatise proceeds to\r\nstate the signification of dreams which relate to the sun, moon, and\r\nstars, of which the last are said to be connected with the external\r\nparts of the body, the sun with the middle, and the moon with the\r\ncavities. This is the nearest approach to alchemy which I have met with\r\nin the works of any of the ancient physicians. But I must not proceed\r\nmuch further with my extracts from this work, which there is no reason\r\nto suppose a genuine production of Hippocrates, and the substance of\r\nwhich would not much interest the general reader nowadays, when the\r\ninterpretation of dreams has been entirely abandoned by the profession.\r\nThe work concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n“He who observes these rules as laid down by us will be healthy through\r\nlife.... The regimen, also, as far as it was possible for a man to find\r\nit out with the assistance of the gods, has been expounded by me.” This\r\nlooks like the conclusion of a large work, and gives probability to the\r\nsupposition that this treatise originally formed a part of the work “On\r\nDiet,” as stated above.[206]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that this work, although little regarded now, was\r\nhighly esteemed two hundred years ago, for we find that the celebrated\r\nJulius Cæsar Scaliger wrote an elaborate commentary on it.[207] On the\r\n“Oneirocritica,” see further Vander Linden, “Manuductio ad Mediciam,”\r\nwho refers to this treatise of Hippocrates, and also to the works\r\nof Scaliger, Ferrer, and Cardanus on the same subject. The only\r\nother ancient writers on this subject which have come down to us are\r\nArtemidorus, Achmet, Astrampsychus, and Nicephorus.[208] The work of\r\nArtemidorus is an elaborate production on the interpretation of all\r\nsorts of dreams; and to the sober judgment of the present generation it\r\ncannot but be regarded as a memorable instance of the misapplication of\r\nhuman intellect and industry. The whole subject of the “Oneirocritica,”\r\nhowever, may well deserve the serious consideration of the most learned\r\nphilosopher as affording a most striking and lamentable proof how\r\nprone men, even of cultivated minds, are to view things exactly in the\r\nlight in which they fancy them to exist. This truth is most strikingly\r\nillustrated by the work of Artemidorus, who first gives the theory, as\r\nit were, of dreams, and in the last book relates particular instances\r\nin confirmation of the principles previously laid down by him. No one,\r\nassuredly, can rise from the perusal of such a work without being\r\nstrongly impressed with the great truth embodied in our author’s first\r\naphorism, “Experience is fallacious, and decision is difficult.” The\r\n“Oneirocritica” of Achmet is the work of an Arabian, and is interesting\r\nas containing all the superstitious notions of the Orientals, that\r\nis to say, of the Persians, Egyptians, and Indians, on this subject.\r\nAllusion is also made to the dreams recorded in the Jewish Scripture.\r\nThe author sets out with declaring that, from the interpretation of\r\ndreams one may acquire a certain foreknowledge of all the casualties\r\nof life, namely, of life or death, of poverty or riches, of disease or\r\nhealth, of joy or sorrow, of victory over one’s enemies or defeat, and\r\nthis with far greater accuracy than from astronomy (astrology?), for\r\nthat astronomers differed much in opinion among themselves, whereas\r\nabout the interpretation of dreams there could be no doubt!!\r\n\r\nThe following list of writers on the “Oneirocritica” previous to\r\nArtemidorus will show the attention which has been paid to this\r\nsubject in very early times: Artemon Milesius, Antiphon, Apollodorus\r\nTellmissensis, Apollonius Atalensis, Aristander Telmissensis,\r\nAristarchus, Alexander Myndius, Cratippus, Demetrius Phalereus,\r\nDionysius Rhodius, Epicharmus, Geminus Tyrius, Hermippus, Nicostratus\r\nEphesius, Phœbus Antiochenus, Philochorus, Panyasis Halicarnessensis,\r\nSerapion, Strabo. Mighty names once on a day! Now they are but “the\r\ndream of a shadow!”[209]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XXVIII. Περὶ παθῶν--_On Affections_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise being passed over in silence by Erotian, and rejected\r\nas unworthy of Hippocrates by Galen, although he acknowledges that it\r\ncontains many fine things,[210] has been generally regarded as spurious\r\nby modern critics, as for example, Foës, Haller, Gruner, Ackerman,\r\nLittré, Greenhill, and others. The work is carefully written, but\r\nseemingly without a plan, or any well-defined object. It touches, in\r\ngeneral terms, on most of the diseases to which the human body is\r\nsubject, and concludes with some general observations on regimen. All\r\ndiseases are said to be derived from phlegm or bile. This seems very\r\nunlike the etiology of diseases, as laid down in the true Hippocratic\r\ntreatises. Pleurisy is to be treated by purgatives and soothing\r\napplications, but without any mention of bleeding. The termination of\r\nthe disease in empyema is described. The symptoms of pneumonia are\r\nalso given in brief but striking terms. The sputa, at first, are said\r\nto consist of phlegm, and are thick and pure, but on the sixth and\r\nseventh day they become somewhat bilious and sublivid. This disease is\r\nalso said to terminate in empyema. Some of the general observations\r\ncontained in this work are deserving of attention. Of all the diseases\r\nthe acute are the most painful and the most fatal, and they require the\r\ngreatest care and the most accurate treatment. No additional mischief\r\nshould, at all events, be inflicted by the physician, but he must do\r\nthe patient as much good as lies in his power; and if the physician\r\ntreats the case properly, and the patient sinks under the weight of\r\nthe disease, it will not be the physician’s fault; but if, while the\r\nphysician does not treat nor understand the disease properly, the\r\npatient fall a victim to the disease, the physician will then be to\r\nblame. In treating ileus, when a clyster fails to relieve the bowels,\r\nthey are to be inflated by means of a bladder attached to a pipe, and\r\nthen the pipe is to be removed, and a clyster immediately injected, in\r\nwhich case, if the bowels admit the clyster, they will be opened, and\r\nthe patient will recover, but if otherwise, he will die, especially on\r\nthe seventh day. The treatise further contains some very interesting\r\nremarks on the causes and varieties of dropsy. When the water is not\r\notherwise removed, an incision is to be made either at the navel,\r\nor behind at the loins. It deserves to be mentioned that, in this\r\ntreatise, there are frequent references to a work of the author’s “On\r\nMedicines.” Whether it was the same as the treatise bearing that title\r\nwhich we possess cannot be determined. In the course of the work, the\r\nuse of the cautery is freely recommended for the cure of diseases.\r\n\r\nFrom the account which we have given of this treatise, and the paucity\r\nof evidence in favor of its genuineness, it will readily be understood\r\nthat we have no hesitation in deciding that it is not one of the\r\ngenuine productions of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n\r\n         XXIX. Περὶ τῶν ἐντὸς παθῶν--_On Internal Affections_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise has but little ancient authority in support of it.\r\nErotian has omitted it in his list of the works of Hippocrates;\r\nPalladius does not mention it; and Galen notices it in a confused\r\nmanner under a variety of titles.[211] Foës, Schulze, and others, have\r\nreferred it to the Cnidian school; and if this point could be made\r\nout satisfactorily, it would give the treatise a remarkable degree of\r\ninterest, as furnishing us with a key to the opinions of one of the\r\noldest sects in medicine. That the reader may be enabled to form his\r\nown opinion in this matter, we will now give a brief outline of its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nThe work commences with a short description of hæmoptysis, which is\r\nsaid to originate either in ulceration or rupture of an artery of the\r\nlungs, the ordinary causes of which are held to be severe exercise,\r\nfalls, blows, violent vomiting, or fevers. The symptoms are pretty well\r\ndescribed, and a mild system of treatment recommended. Inflammation\r\nof the lungs is said to be produced principally by drinking wine, and\r\nan immoderate indulgence in eating mullets and eels. The treatment at\r\nfirst is like what we have described the Cnidian system to have been,\r\nconsisting of milk, emetics, and purges; but if these do not answer,\r\nthe actual cautery is to be applied to the breast. Erysipelas of the\r\nlungs is described in much the same terms as at “De Morbis,” i., 13;\r\nii., 53.[212] A correct description is given of empyema as connected\r\nwith tubercle of the side, for which draughts are recommended, with\r\nbroth made from poppies, etc. When matter forms, it is to be let out\r\neither by the knife or the cautery.[213] Three species of phthisis\r\nare described, the first being derived from phlegm, the second from\r\nviolent labor, and the third being the tabes dorsalis. The treatment\r\nin all these affections appears to be very empirical, and unlike the\r\nusual therapeutics of Hippocrates. Four diseases of the kidneys are\r\ndescribed, of which the first is calculus, and the second abscess, in\r\nwhich case the writer recommends an incision to be made, in order to\r\nfurnish an outlet to the pus. Now, it is deserving of remark, that,\r\nof all the ancient authorities which have come down to us, Ruffus\r\nEphesius would appear to be the only other author who makes mention\r\nof this practice.[214] The author of the treatise states, that if the\r\nmatter of the abscess find vent by the intestinum rectum the patient\r\nmay recover. The disease altogether, he adds, is troublesome, and in\r\nmany cases ends in renal tabes. He most probably here alludes to what\r\nis now called Bright’s disease. From disease of the kidneys is said\r\nto arise an affection of the venæ cavæ, which runs from the head near\r\nthe jugulars, along the spine to the malleolus externus. He says it\r\noriginates in bile and phlegm which collect in the veins. Varices, I\r\nsuppose, are here meant to be described. If not cured by purging with\r\nhellebore and scammony, the actual cautery is to be applied at the\r\nshoulders, below the scapulæ, at the hip-joint, at the middle of the\r\nthigh, above the knee, and at the ankle. Now it is deserving of notice,\r\nthat this disease is not mentioned by subsequent authors on medicine,\r\nso that we are warranted in concluding that the treatise was not looked\r\nupon by them as being a production of the Great Hippocrates: for if\r\nit had been so regarded, we are sure that Galen, Aretæus, Celsus, and\r\nall the worthies of the Arabian school, would not have overlooked\r\nthis description. And, moreover, the description of the disease from\r\nfirst to last is vague and prolix, being the very reverse of that\r\ngraphic style of delineation which we find in the genuine works of\r\nHippocrates: and yet the work contains other matters of a different\r\nstamp. For example, treating of dropsy, the author says it is sometimes\r\nconnected with tubercles of the lungs, which get filled with water and\r\nburst into the chest. In proof of this, he appeals to observations on\r\ncattle, sheep, and swine, which are said to be very subject to these\r\ntubercles (phymata); and he argues that men are still more liable to\r\nthem. And in many cases, he adds, empyema originates in tubercles. In\r\nthat case, when the collection protrudes externally, he directs that\r\nan opening should be made in it; but if not, he directs the patient to\r\nbe shaken by the shoulders, when the sound of the fluid within will\r\nbe heard. When the side in which the greater collection is situated\r\nhas been ascertained, he recommends us to cut down to the third rib\r\nfrom the last, and then make a perforation with a trocar[215] (τρυπάνῳ\r\nτρυγλητηρίῳ), so as to give vent to a small portion of the fluid; the\r\nopening is then to be filled with a tent, and the remainder evacuated\r\nafter twelve days. Four species of icterus are described: these would\r\nappear to be febrile affections. Five varieties of typhus are next\r\nnoticed in rather vague terms; there can be little doubt that they were\r\nall cases of remittent fever. Several varieties of a disease which\r\nis called morbus crassus are described with much prolixity, and so\r\nvaguely as not convey to us a distinct idea of the disease. He says of\r\ntwo of the varieties, that they last for six years. Unless these were\r\nvarieties of elephantiasis (and we have no evidence of its existence so\r\nearly), I am at a loss to comprehend what disease is alluded to. The\r\ntreatise concludes with an account of three species of tetanus.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis now given of its contents, it will be readily seen\r\nthat this work abounds in interesting matter, but that, at the same\r\ntime, it is clearly of a different stamp from what we find in the\r\ngenuine works of Hippocrates, nay, that in all probability it does not\r\nbelong to the Coan school. In conclusion, I have, then, to state that I\r\nthink the presumption of its being a production of the Cnidian school\r\nis very strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XXX. Περὶ νοὐσων--_On Diseases_.\r\n\r\nA work with this title is cited by Erotian, Cælius Aurelianus,[216] and\r\nby Galen,[217] but so confusedly that we must come to the conclusion\r\nregarding these Books, that the ancient authority in support of their\r\ngenuineness is by no means satisfactory. Galen evidently inclines to\r\nthe opinion of Dioscorides the Commentator, that the Second Book is\r\nthe work of the younger Hippocrates, this is to say, of a grandson of\r\nour author. Almost all the modern authorities, as, for example, Foës,\r\nHaller, Ackerman, Gruner, and Littré, concur in rejecting the whole\r\nfour as spurious. The Fourth Book in particular is separated by M.\r\nLittré from the other three, as being a portion of the work “On the\r\nDiseases of Women,” rather than of the work “On Diseases.” We shall\r\nbe better enabled to speak decidedly on this and the other questions\r\nregarding the authenticity of these books, when we have examined the\r\nnature of their contents.\r\n\r\nAfter a very striking exordium, in which it is stated that the first\r\nobject of him who turns his attention to the healing art should be to\r\nconsider the causes of disease, and the natural tendencies of every one\r\nof them, that is to say, of their dispositions to death, or to loss of\r\nparts, the author proceeds to deliver his doctrine as to the causes\r\nof them, which he assumes to be either internal, namely, bile and\r\nphlegm; or external, such as labor, wounds and excess in heat, cold,\r\ndryness, and humidity. The following accidents are said to be mortal:\r\na wound of the brain, of the spinal marrow, of the liver, of the\r\ndiaphragm, of the bladder, of a large blood-vessel, or of the heart.\r\nHe ranks the following as fatal diseases: phthisis, dropsy, and, when\r\nthey attack a pregnant woman, pneumonia, causus, pleurisy, phrenitis,\r\nand erysipelas of the womb. The issue of the following is set down\r\nas doubtful in ordinary circumstances: pneumonia, causus, phrenitis,\r\npleuritis, quinsy, enlargement of the uvula, hepatitis, splenitis,\r\nnephritis, dysentery, menorrhagia. The following are not deadly:\r\nchronic defluxions on the joints (κέδματα), melancholy, gout, ischiatic\r\ndisease, tenesmus, quartan and tertian fevers, strangury, ophthalmy,\r\nleprosy, lichen, arthritis; yet even from these patients often become\r\nmaimed in particular members, such as in the limbs from arthritis, or\r\nin the eyes from ophthalmy. Diseases also have a tendency to pass into\r\none another, as, for example, pleurisy into causus, phrenitis into\r\npneumonia, tenesmus into dysentery, and lientery; and pleurisy and\r\npneumonia into empyema. He makes the following curious observations\r\non the awkward mistakes which a physician may commit in the practice\r\nof his profession: not to know when there is matter in an abscess or\r\ntubercle; not to ascertain the existence of fractures or dislocations;\r\nhaving probed the head in case of injury thereof, not to ascertain\r\nthat there is a fracture of the skull; not to be able to introduce an\r\ninstrument into the bladder, nor to be able to ascertain whether there\r\nis a stone in it or not; in the case of empyema, not to ascertain the\r\nexistence of matter by succussion; and in using the knife or cautery,\r\nto apply either of them to too great or too small an extent. The\r\ntreatise also contains many other general observations, which are very\r\ningeniously stated, as, for example, the following enumeration of the\r\nuntoward accidents which may occur to a medical practitioner: Having\r\nadministered an emetic for the purpose of evacuating bile or phlegm\r\nupwards, to induce rupture of a vessel by the act of vomiting, although\r\nthe patient had previously been sensible of no pain in the region;\r\nhaving given an emetic to a woman with child, to induce abortion\r\nin consequence; in curing empyema, when looseness of the bowels is\r\nsuperinduced, and cuts off the patient; in applying an ointment for\r\na disease of the eyes, when acute pains supervene, which end either\r\nin rupture of the eye or amaurosis, the physician in such a case gets\r\nthe blame for having applied the ointment; and when a physician gives\r\nanything to a woman in labor on account of pains in the bowels, and the\r\nwoman gets worse or dies, the physician incurs censure. And in diseases\r\nand injuries, when there is a necessary succession of bad symptoms, the\r\nphysician gets the blame, as men do not perceive that the aggravation\r\nof the symptoms is a necessary consequence of the nature of the\r\ndisease. And if a physician visits a patient in fever, or who has met\r\nwith an injury, and if the patient gets worse after the first medicine\r\nthat is administered, the physician is blamed; whereas he does not get\r\nthe same amount of credit if the patient improves, as the amendment\r\nis attributed to the nature of the case. This book contains what I\r\nbelieve is the most circumstantial detail of the phenomena of empyema\r\nthat is to be met with in any ancient work on medicine. The author\r\nascribes the disease principally to three causes: to the termination\r\nof pneumonia, to a defluxion from the head, and to the consequences of\r\na ruptured vessel. Whoever is acquainted with the modern literature of\r\nthe subject, or possesses a practical knowledge of the disease, will\r\nnot fail, from the accompanying description of the last of these, to\r\nrecognize a case of cavity of the lungs produced by the ulceration\r\nof tubercles. True empyema, however, as the result of chronic\r\ninflammation, is also described in distinct terms. The never-failing\r\ntest by succussion is constantly adverted to in these cases. Distinct\r\nmention is also made of the _râle_, by which the existence of\r\nmatter in the lungs is ascertained. Allusion is probably made here to\r\nthe well-known gurgling sound produced by matter in a cavity. There\r\nis a good deal of other important matters in this book, but these my\r\nnecessary limits oblige me to pass over unnoticed. I shall merely\r\nallude to the distinct mention which is made of _ruptures_, by\r\nwhich was meant a severe sprain or other injury ending in suppuration,\r\nor protracted pains in the part. Fever is said to be formed in this\r\nmanner: when bile or phlegm is heated, the whole of the body is heated,\r\nand they are heated either by internal things, such as food or drink,\r\nor by external, such as labor, wounds, excess of heat or cold; also\r\nfrom the sight or hearing, but rarely from these. In the treatment of\r\npneumonia, venesection in the arm is recommended. Altogether this book\r\ncontains much valuable matter, but mixed up with hypothesis in a way\r\nnot usually met with in the genuine works of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nThe second book, at the very commencement, betrays a strong\r\ndisposition to diagnosis. Eight diseases at the head are described, but\r\nin such terms that we fail to recognize the distinguishing features\r\nof each. Besides these, a little way further on the author describes\r\nseveral other diseases of the head, including hydrocephalus, the\r\nsymptoms of which are given with great precision, namely, acute pain\r\nabout the bregma and temples, alternate rigor and fever, impairment\r\nof the sight, double vision, vertigo, etc. He recommends errhines,\r\npurgatives, and even trepanning of the skull. Even of this disease\r\nseveral varieties are described in very striking terms; so that for\r\nonce at least we are tempted to question the correctness of the\r\njudgment which Hippocrates pronounced against the rival school of\r\nCnidos, for cultivating diagnosis to an undue extent.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of quinsy are likewise described, including various\r\ndiseases of the parts about the fauces, and among them the disease\r\nnamed _hypoglottis_, by which appears to be meant an abscess below the\r\ntongue, attended with swelling of that organ. Five varieties of polypus\r\nnasi are next described, and suitable plans of treatment recommended,\r\nnamely, with the ligature, the knife, and the cautery. Pleurisy and\r\npneumonia are described, and their termination in empyema, the symptoms\r\nof which are circumstantially described again; and, moreover, three\r\nvarieties of it are noticed. Here, again, we find mention made of the\r\ndiagnostic method, by succussion, and a recommendation of the operation\r\nof _paracentesis thoracis_, to evacuate the fluid. Next are described\r\nseveral varieties of phthisis, including the _tabes dorsalis_, of\r\nwhich a curious description is given. An interesting account is also\r\ngiven of _spermatorrhœa_. The treatment consists in abstinence from\r\nimmoderate drinking, venery, and excessive exercises, except walking,\r\n_for a year_, avoiding cold and the sun, and taking the tepid bath. The\r\ndescription of the varieties of pulmonic disease is most interesting,\r\nalthough some of them are not sufficiently well defined. Hydrothorax is\r\nalso described, and paracentesis recommended in the treatment of it.\r\nAfter describing lethargy, which was clearly a species of remittent\r\nfever, he gives descriptions of certain diseases, under the names of\r\n_morbus resiccatorius_ (ἀυαντή), _Febris mortifera_, _Lividus morbus_,\r\n_morbus ructus ciens_, and _morbus pituitosus_. No one can fail to\r\nrecognize in these descriptions the spirit of the Cnidian school of\r\nmedicine, and one very different from that of Hippocrates. Indeed\r\nwe have positive authority for referring this work to the Cnidian\r\nschool, for Galen assigns the description of the _morbus lividus_ to\r\nthe Cnidian physician Euryphon.[218] The author describes a singular\r\nspecies of melancholy, which, he says, is sometimes epidemic in spring;\r\nhe calls it _cura, morbus gravis_. It appears to have been a variety\r\nof the lycanthropia. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, III., 16. The book concludes\r\nwith a description of two species of _melæna_, and of _sphacelotes_,\r\nthe latter being a variety of the other. Now what strikes one in going\r\nover this book is, that it cannot be a portion of the same work as the\r\nFirst Book, for we cannot conceive it probable that an author would\r\nhave treated twice of the very same subjects in one work. Moreover, as\r\nwe have stated, there are evidently many things in it which are not at\r\nall in accordance with the principles of the Coan school.\r\n\r\nIn the third book very much the same ground is again gone over as\r\nin the two preceding books. In the first place, diseases of the head\r\nare described under the names of _tumor cerebri_, _plenitudo cerebri\r\ndolorem inferens_, _sydere icti_, _sphacelismus_, _lethargus_ (then\r\nintervenes a brief account of _Febris ardens_, quite out of place),\r\nof _dolor capitis_, and _phrenitis_. Afterwards comes a description\r\nof _cynanche_, and _paracynanche_, next of _icterus_, and afterwards\r\nof _tetanus_, for the cure of which the author recommends the cold\r\naffusion. (On the merits and demerits of this practice, see the English\r\nedition of PAULUS ÆGINETA, III., 20.) For ileus, as in a preceding\r\nbook, among other modes of treatment, it is directed to inflate the\r\nbowels by means of a pipe and bladder, and then to evacuate their\r\ncontents with a clyster. Afterward, pneumonia and pleurisy are most\r\ncircumstantially described, and the treatment of them laid down with\r\na degree of prolixity very unlike the usual manner of Hippocrates.\r\nThus, to promote the expectoration in pleurisy, he recommends the flos\r\næris, asafœtida, trefoil, pepper, etc.[219] I am not aware that any\r\nother ancient authority recommends these medicines for the cure of\r\nthis disease. The symptoms and diagnosis of empyema as the consequence\r\nof pleurisy, are given in much the same terms as in the preceding\r\nbook. Succussion is particularly alluded to. For empyema, burning and\r\nincision are recommended. In performing paracentesis, he forbids all\r\nthe matter to be evacuated at once. Altogether, a perusal of this book\r\nleads me to the positive inference that it is not the production of\r\nthe same author as the two preceding books; for what could induce the\r\nauthor to go over the same ground three different times in one work?\r\n\r\nThe fourth book is manifestly the production of a different author\r\nfrom the others, indeed, as appears evident from the conclusion\r\nof the work, it is continuous with the treatise “On the Nature of\r\nWomen.” It commences with an elaborate discussion on the four humors,\r\nblood, phlegm, water, and bile, from which all diseases are said to\r\nderive their origin. The whole book is tinged with the exposition\r\nof this doctrine; indeed all the contents of it are for the most\r\npart hypothetical, and very unlike the matter contained in the\r\ngenuine compositions of Hippocrates. From first to last there is no\r\nwell-defined description of disease in it. The observations on lumbrici\r\nand calculus are the portions of it which command the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nI shall now briefly recapitulate the conclusions which I am prepared\r\nto draw from a careful examination of the contents of this work. 1.\r\nAs the same diseases, for example, pleurisy, pneumonia, and empyema,\r\nare all circumstantially treated of in each of the first three books,\r\nit is impossible to suppose them all portions of the same work, or\r\neven the productions of the same author. 2. In the fourth a different\r\nhypothesis is advanced from that which is laid down in the first, and\r\nfrom this circumstance, joined to many other considerations already\r\nenumerated, there can be no doubt that it is the production of an\r\nentirely different author. 3. Although all parts of these books\r\ncontain abundance of valuable materials, many of the principles and\r\nrules of practice which are developed in them are not akin to those of\r\nHippocrates, but rather savor of the Cnidian school, which trusted too\r\nmuch to a fanciful diagnosis, instead of cultivating prognosis as the\r\nbasis of its system, like the school of Hippocrates and his followers.\r\n4. The internal evidence in the present instance against their\r\ngenuineness, more than counterbalances the small amount of ancient\r\nauthority which there is in support of these books.\r\n\r\n\r\n          XXXI. Περὶ ἑπταμήνου--_On the Seven Months’ Birth_.\r\n\r\n         XXXII. Περὶ ὀκταμήνου--_On the Eight Months’ Birth_.\r\n\r\nAlthough the genuineness of these two works is admitted by Galen[220]\r\nand by Foës,[221] they are not looked upon as the productions of\r\nHippocrates by almost any other of the authorities, whether ancient or\r\nmodern, and in particular, Palladius, Ackerman, Gruner, Littré, and\r\nGreenhill reject them. Yet all admit them to be of very high antiquity,\r\nso that, in this respect, they are not destitute of considerable\r\ninterest. The contents of them are altogether of a philosophical\r\nnature, and such as we might expect the school of Democritus to\r\nproduce. The author of them holds that fœtuses born at the seventh\r\nmonth survive, but not those of the eighth. It is clear that he was\r\nimbued with the Pythagorean notions regarding the mystical power of the\r\nnumber seven.[222] Altogether, the style and matter of these treatises\r\ndo not appear to me to accord well with the spirit which prevails in\r\nthe true Hippocratic works, but at the same time it must be admitted\r\nthat the preponderance of authority for or against their authenticity\r\nis not decided.[223]\r\n\r\n\r\n       XXXIII. Ἐπιδημών, β’, δ’, ε’, ς’, ζ’--_The 2d, 4th, 5th,\r\n                 6th, and 7th Books of the Epidemics_.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Erotian, who admits the whole of the seven books\r\nof Epidemics into his list of the works of Hippocrates, I am not aware\r\nthat any of the authorities, ancient or modern, recognize them as\r\ngenuine. Galen says that the seventh is allowed by all to be spurious;\r\nthat the fifth is the work of Hippocrates, the son of Draco, that is\r\nto say, of a grandson of the great Hippocrates; and that the second,\r\nfourth, and sixth were held by some to be the productions of a son of\r\nHippocrates, and by some they were looked upon as having been written,\r\nindeed, by Hippocrates himself, but merely as notes or commentaries.\r\nGalen himself inclines to the opinion that these four books are the\r\nproduction of Thessalus, the son of Hippocrates.[224]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated respecting these books, it will be clearly\r\nseen that, although there is no reason whatever to suppose they were\r\npublished by Hippocrates, it is, at the same time, highly probable\r\nthat he had something to do with the composition of them, and that,\r\nat all events, they emanated from the school upon which his name has\r\ncast so much splendor. I think myself, therefore, called upon to give a\r\ncondensed view of their contents; and in doing so, I shall not scruple\r\nto avail myself of the very important annotations made on them by\r\nM. Littré, in his recent edition of this portion of the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these books, in general, he observes that they are\r\nnaturally divided into two groups, the one containing the second,\r\nfourth, and sixth books, the other the fifth and seventh. The\r\ncorrectness of this division is quite evident from a comparison of\r\nthe contents of the different books, and, to a certain extent, it is\r\nrecognized by Galen.[225]\r\n\r\nAs to the locality of these observations, M. Littré shows that the spot\r\nof their greatest activity is Thessaly and Thrace, although mention of\r\nAthens, and of certain cities of the Peloponnesus occasionally occurs.\r\nHe traces with much minuteness the connection of these books with the\r\nother works in the Hippocratic Collection. For example, he shows the\r\nconnection between those in the first group, with the “Aphorisms,”\r\nin particular, but also with the treatises, “On Airs,” etc., “The\r\nMochlicus,” “The Surgery,” etc., and of those in the other group, with\r\nthe work “On Wounds of the Head” in particular. I will now offer a few\r\nremarks on the contents of each of these books.\r\n\r\nM. Littré, in his argument prefixed to the second book, treats of\r\nvarious matters contained in it, the most interesting of which is his\r\nelaborate disquisition on the nature of the carbuncles (ἄνθρακες)\r\ndescribed in his book, during the course of which he brings into review\r\nvarious collateral passages from the works of subsequent authors, and\r\ndiscusses the question at considerable length whether or not they\r\napply to smallpox. I am free to admit that it would have been to my\r\nadvantage if I had seen this part of the writings of M. Littré before\r\npiling my commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. IV., 25. I must\r\nbe permitted to say, however, that I see no reason for changing my\r\nopinions with regard to the anthrax of the Greek writers on medicine.\r\nI certainly cannot agree with M. Theod. Kauser, in setting down the\r\nancient descriptions of the anthrax and plague (λοιμὸς) as applying\r\nto the smallpox. Having diligently studied the minute descriptions\r\nwhich the ancient medical authors give of the different varieties of\r\ncutaneous disease, I am confident that if the smallpox had actually\r\nexisted in their days, they would not have passed over the disease with\r\na vague and casual notice, but would have given us such a sketch of its\r\nappearances that no one could have failed to recognize its features.\r\nThe carbuncles, then, which are incidentally mentioned by Hippocrates\r\nat the beginning of this book, I am disposed to look upon as one of\r\nthose anomalous phases of disease which are every now and then making\r\ntheir appearance, and I cannot persuade myself that they had anything\r\nto do with smallpox.\r\n\r\nAmong the important matters contained in this book may be noticed the\r\nremarks on deposits, an interesting subject often alluded to in the\r\nHippocratic treatises, § 7. At § 22 a case is obscurely noticed, which\r\nM. Littré concludes, but upon very slight grounds, to have been a case\r\nof purulent infection. At § 24 spontaneous luxation of the cervical\r\nvertebræ is described, as M. Littré, in his argument, remarks, with\r\nadmirable judgment. It is also alluded to at “Aphoris,” iii., 26, and\r\n“De Articulis,” tom. iv., p. 179, ed. Littré. This affection, which\r\ncame afterwards to be overlooked, has been redescribed of late years.\r\nIn the third section there is given an interesting account of causus,\r\nthe remittent fever of hot climates, so admirably described afterward\r\nby Aretæus. The fourth section is occupied with a description of the\r\nveins of the body, which is certainly confused, and yet we find in it\r\nthe distinction between the nature of the arteries and veins clearly\r\npointed out. It is curious, moreover, that Galen, in one place, stands\r\nup for this part as being genuine and accurate.[226] See also b.v. §\r\n46. The last two sections treat professedly of physiognomy, but contain\r\nother detached and unconnected observations on medical subjects.\r\nAltogether, the impression which a careful perusal of this book conveys\r\nto one is, that it is a compilation of the most incongruous matters,\r\nstrung together without any plan; but, at the same time, one cannot\r\nfail to detect in it traces of no contemptible talent for observation\r\nand description.\r\n\r\nThe fourth book, of the whole number, is the one which is written with\r\nthe least unity of design. Yet, as M. Littré remarks, it is interesting\r\nas containing the history of an epidemical causus, complicated with\r\njaundice and ophthalmia, which would appear to have been very similar\r\nto the febrile epidemic which prevailed in Scotland a few years ago.\r\nWith this opinion I entirely acquiesce, after having had a good deal\r\nof experience in the treatment of that epidemic. It was decidedly of\r\nthe remittent type, was frequently accompanied with jaundice, and the\r\npatients were very subject to relapses and affections of the eyes.[227]\r\nFor Hippocrates’s description of it see tom. v., p. 169, ed. Littré.\r\nM. Littré also makes the important remark that, of late years, proper\r\nattention has not been paid to the state of the urine at the epoch of\r\na crisis in fevers. He mentions that M. Martin Solon holds that, at\r\nthe resolution of diseases, the urine is apt to become albuminous;\r\nbut that, in a true crisis, the precipitate is generally composed of\r\nurate of ammonia. M. Zimmerman found the urinary deposit composed of\r\nthe urate of ammonia, with the triple phosphates and the crystals of\r\nuric acid. Certain observations on this critical deposit occur in this\r\nbook of the Epidemics, but they are met with more frequently and more\r\ndistinctly expressed in the genuine books, I mean the first and third.\r\nIt appears to me most remarkable that the important observations made\r\nby Hippocrates on the state of the urine in febrile diseases should\r\nhave been lost sight of in an age when the chemical characters of the\r\nurine have been so much studied; for I am fully satisfied, from my own\r\npractical acquaintance with fevers, that in most cases the febrile\r\ncrisis is marked by a copious sediment in the urine. An interesting\r\ncase of empyema, which was treated by the cautery, is related at §\r\n4. A case is related at § 19 of a singular affection of the mouth in\r\ntwo children, attended with necrosis and exfoliation of the bones. At\r\n§ 39 there is a case of metastasis of purulent matter from the hand\r\nto the lungs. At § 11 a case is related of a child who sustained an\r\ninjury in the head from another child, was trepanned, and died on the\r\ntwenty-fourth day. We shall see in the work “On Injuries of the Head”\r\nthat the ancients were very free in the application of the trepan to\r\nthe skull. Cases of nyctalopia are alluded to at § 52, and at § 58 a\r\ncase is related of mania supervening on the cure of hemorrhoids. But,\r\nupon the whole, the most interesting part of this book is that which\r\ncontains the narratives of febrile cases, and the remarks on relapses,\r\n§ 28.\r\n\r\nThough the fifth and seventh books of the Epidemics are pronounced by\r\nGalen to be unworthy of the Great Hippocrates, they contain detached\r\nobservations of much interest, insomuch that Haller was almost disposed\r\nto admit the genuineness of the fifth. Lemos and Mercuriali, on\r\nthe other hand, hold them to be wholly removed from all connection\r\nwith the genuine remains of Hippocrates. It is remarkable, however,\r\nthat the fifth is referred to by Celsus,[228] Quintilian,[229] and\r\nPlutarch.[230] This, in fact, is the book which contains the memorable\r\npassage in which the author admits, that in a case of injury of the\r\nhead he mistook a fracture for a suture of the skull,[231] and for\r\nthis candid admission Hippocrates is highly lauded by the authors we\r\nhave just quoted. The Hippocratic treatises also contain many other\r\ninstances in which the author admits having committed mistakes. How\r\nmuch might the medical art not have advanced before this time, if\r\nthe example thus set of recording for the benefit of posterity, the\r\nmistakes which one commits had been more generally followed?[232]\r\nThe first paragraph contains the case of a woman who had fever and\r\ntook medicine which did her no good; a hard swelling, accompanied\r\nwith severe pains, seized her below the navel, which were removed\r\nby strongly rubbing in oil with the hands, after which she had a\r\ncopious discharge of blood downwards, and recovered. M. Littré, from\r\na comparison of this passage with Epidem. ii., 6, 26; iv., 45, 56,\r\ndraws the conclusion, that reference is here made to the practice\r\nof compressing the bowels with the hands in cases of ileus, for\r\nwhich Praxagoras, the master or Herophilus, is censured by Cælius\r\nAurelianus.[233] At § 9 there is the case of a man affected with\r\nprurigo, and a condition of the skin resembling leprosy, which nobody\r\ncould remove. He then went to the hot baths in the island of Melos, and\r\nwas cured of his cutaneous affection, but soon after became dropsical\r\nand died. In § 10 there is related a case of cholera, treated with\r\nhellebore, which produced great evacuations upwards and downwards,\r\nand the patient recovered. This mode of practice is animadverted upon\r\nby Cælius Aurelianus. (Morb. Acut. iii., 20.) § 12th contains an\r\ninstructive history of headache in a woman, which nothing relieved\r\nbut free menstruation, and afterwards conception. At § 15, there is a\r\nvery interesting case of necrosis or caries at the hip-joint, for the\r\nrelief of which a large incision was made down to the bone and the\r\ncautery applied; on the eleventh day tetanus supervened, and proved\r\nfatal on the eighth day afterwards, although treated by embrocations,\r\nfomentations, and strong purgatives. The author remarks in conclusion,\r\nthat the patient would have lived longer, if the purgative medicine\r\nhad not been administered. At § 16 there is a case of injury of the\r\nhead, where the surgeon at first sawed the bone down to the diploe, a\r\npractice alluded to in the treatise “On Injuries of the Head,” § 21.\r\nIn this case erysipelas came on, and yet the patient recovered. It\r\nis to be regretted that the text here is in a corrupt state. At § 18\r\nthere is a case of pregnancy in which the administration of a strong\r\npurgative was followed by fatal results. At § 20 there is related a\r\ncase of hemorrhoids, seemingly _mali moris_, which proved fatal\r\nin consequence of an operation having been performed upon them. § 24th\r\ncontains the history of a case of hæmoptysis, which ended in phthisis.\r\nThe author makes the shrewd remark that the patient was indisposed\r\nbefore the vomiting of blood commenced. I may here remark, how well\r\nthis accords with the doctrine of Louis, that hæmoptysis is rather\r\nthe consequence than the cause of tubercular disease. At § 38 there\r\nis another case of hæmoptysis in which the patient was choked by a\r\nlarge quantity of blood which he was bringing up; the spleen also, in\r\nthis case, was affected, and there were bloody discharges downwards.\r\nThis book contains a great variety of serious cases connected with\r\naccidents. At § 50 is a fatal case of concussion of the brain. At §\r\n74 there is a fatal case of tetanus supervening upon a slight injury\r\nof one of the fingers and in the following section there is a case of\r\ntetanus arising from a strain of the thumb and proving fatal. In the\r\nnext section there is a case of fatal tetanus from the injudicious\r\nhealing of a sore on the leg.\r\n\r\nThough Galen refuses to sustain the sixth book as genuine, he\r\nhas written an elaborate commentary upon it, and mentions at the\r\ncommencement that commentaries had been written upon it before his\r\ntime by Zeuxis of Tarentum, the Erythræan Heraclides, and before\r\nthem by Bacchius and Glaucis. It is a large work, being divided into\r\neight different sections, which have little or no connection with one\r\nanother. Upon the whole, as M. Littré remarks, the most interesting\r\nportion of it is the part in which are described the phenomena\r\nattending an epidemic cough, or influenza, which reigned in Perinthus.\r\nSee § vii. It broke out in winter about the solstice, and was preceded\r\nby great changes of the winds. There was a great tendency to relapses,\r\nand it was further complicated with pulmonic affections, nyctalopia,\r\nangina, paralysis, etc. It was observed, that any member which was\r\nmuch exposed to fatigue was the part most liable to be attacked. All\r\nthese complications occurred in the relapse, and never in the original\r\nattack. Women were less liable to be affected than men, the reason of\r\nwhich is supposed to have been, that they do not expose themselves\r\nso much to the air as men do. In women, too, all the attacks were\r\nmild; but in the men some were mild and others fatal. When a febrile\r\nrigor supervened, the attack speedily was mortal. The usual remedies\r\nwere tried, namely, purging, venesection, bleeding by the renal vein,\r\nand emetics; but none of them did any good. M. Littré remarks, that\r\nin the course of his reading he has never met with an example of an\r\nepidemic exactly resembling the one here described. It is, therefore,\r\nan interesting picture of a disease not otherwise known. The sixth\r\nsection begins with the announcement of the physiological doctrine so\r\nfrequently quoted with approbation, namely, that “the fleshy parts\r\nattract both from the bowels and from without, and that the whole body\r\ninspires and expires.” This doctrine is fully expanded and illustrated\r\nin an interesting volume by Abraham Kaau.[234] The fifth section\r\nopens with another philosophical tenet, which Sydenham often quotes\r\nwith approbation, namely, that “Nature is the physician of diseases.”\r\n“Nature,” the writer adds, “although untaught and uninstructed, does\r\nwhat is proper.” Galen’s Commentary on this passage contains much\r\ninteresting matter, and is a fine specimen of the medical philosophy of\r\nthe ancients.[235]\r\n\r\nThe seventh book, as we have already remarked, is closely allied to\r\nthe fifth. Galen pronounces it to be universally condemned as being\r\nspurious, and of more recent origin than the others; but Littré,\r\nalthough of course he does not stand up for its genuineness, justly\r\ncontends that it is replete with valuable matter. Grimm holds, from the\r\nnature of its contents, that it must have derived its origin from the\r\nCnidian school, whereas the fifth sprung from the Coan. I must say,\r\nhowever, that I cannot see any good grounds for this opinion. According\r\nto M. Littré, it is a _recueil_ of particular facts superior to\r\nanything of the kind left to us by antiquity, and such that its equal\r\ncan scarcely be found in modern times. The cases being for the most\r\npart of an isolated nature and not susceptible of any arrangement, it\r\nis not possible within my narrow limits to give any general idea of\r\nthe contents of this book. I shall be content, therefore, with a very\r\nfew extracts as a specimen of it. It opens with two very interesting\r\ncases of fever, accompanied with sweats, which were treated mildly by\r\npurgatives and clysters, and terminated favorably. It strikes me as\r\nsingular in reading these cases, that the characters of the urine are\r\nnot distinctly given, as in the cases related in the first and third\r\nEpid. All that is said on this score is, that “the urine was like that\r\nof chronic diseases.” The tenth is a case of ardent fever proving fatal\r\nby intestinal hemorrhage. Some of the fatal cases of dropsy following\r\nfever are very instructive, as §§ 20, 21. Two cases of empyema (so\r\nthey are marked by M. Littré) would appear to have been phthisis with\r\ncavities in the lungs. In both, mention is made of _râles_. See\r\n§§ 26, 27, and also 93, 107. In the 29th and six following sections\r\nthere are reports of cases of severe wounds. Apparently they must\r\nhave occurred in the time of war. The 36th, 37th, and 38th, are cases\r\nof tetanus supervening upon very slight wounds. A good many cases\r\nof phthisis are reported, as at §§ 49, 50, 51; in the last of those\r\nthe pectoral _râles_ are particularly noticed. In the 48th the\r\ndisease is ascribed to the woman having been injured by succussion\r\nin order to procure the expulsion of the afterbirth. (On this case\r\nsee the interesting remarks of M. Littré, tom. v., p. 359.) At § 52\r\nare the cases of two children who died of disorder of the bowels,\r\ncomplicated with an affection of the head, as indicated by their\r\nconstantly pressing on the part with the hand; and it is remarked,\r\nthat after death there was a hollow in the seat of the bregma. Every\r\nexperienced physician must have met with such cases. M. Littré refers\r\nin illustration of the disease here treated of to an analysis of a\r\nwork by M. Elsæsser, in the “Archives Générales de Médecine,” March,\r\n1845, p. 346; on _ramollissement_ of the occiput. The cases of\r\nphrenitis, here related, are evidently febrile affections, as at §§ 79,\r\n80. At § 102 a case is related in which serious symptoms supervened on\r\nthe eating of a raw mushroom. The patient being treated by emetics and\r\nthe hot bath, recovered. At § 121 is related the case of a person who\r\nhad convulsive laughter, connected, as was supposed, with a wound of\r\nthe diaphragm.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having concluded my review of these Books of Epidemics, I will\r\nventure to affirm, without fear of contradiction, that when we look to\r\nthe importance and rarity of the matters contained in them, the work,\r\neven at the present day, is perfectly unrivalled. That the books are\r\nthe composition of different hands must be admitted, but altogether\r\nthe contents of them bear the imprint of the mind and spirit of\r\nHippocrates, and evince a talent for the cultivation of medicine which\r\nhas never been surpassed. What a noble people the Greeks must have been\r\nin the days of Themistocles and Pericles!\r\n\r\n\r\n                  XXXIV. Περὶ χυμῶν--_On the Humors_.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that there are few treatises in the Hippocratic\r\nCollection which unite such a concurrence of high authorities, both\r\nancient and modern, in their favor as this work, and yet there seems\r\ngood reason for joining the later critics in refusing its claims to be\r\nreceived as genuine. In favor of it may be quoted Erotian, Palladius,\r\nand Galen, among the ancient, and Foës, Zuinger, and Haller, among\r\nthe modern authorities. Against it are ranged several of the older\r\nauthorities, namely, Zeuxis, Heraclides, and Glaucias, some of whom\r\nrefer it to a younger Hippocrates, some to Thessalus, others to\r\nPolybus, and others again to Democritus.[236] Accordingly, the highest\r\nmodern authorities, as Mercuriali, Gruner, Ackerman, Kühn, and Littré,\r\nrefuse to receive it into the list of genuine works; and the last of\r\nthese seems to make it out pretty clearly that the treatise is composed\r\nof detached observations extracted from the other Hippocratic works.\r\nAfter repeated perusals of it, what strikes myself is, that it bears\r\na close resemblance to the treatise “On the Surgery,” that is to say,\r\nthat it is a recapitulation of the conclusions arrived at in certain\r\nof the other works of Hippocrates. Perhaps, then, it must be admitted\r\nthat there is some inconsistency in allowing the one a place among the\r\ngenuine works of Hippocrates, and refusing the similar claims of the\r\nother. That the work in question contains a most interesting summary\r\nof what were regarded, in ancient times, as great medical truths,\r\ncannot be doubted. From the condensed form in which the subject matters\r\nof it are presented, it will readily be apprehended that they do not\r\nwell admit of being given in the form of an abstract, and that any\r\nspecimens of its contents will afford but a very imperfect idea of its\r\nvalue as a whole. I would remark, at the outset, that the title of the\r\nwork, “On the Humors,” appears not very applicable, since very few of\r\nthe paragraphs relate to the humors; in fact, as already hinted, the\r\ntreatise may be said to be a _recueil_ of various observations\r\ngathered out of other works. I also feel at a loss to account for M.\r\nLittré’s disposition to rank it as the eighth book of the Epidemics,\r\nas it bears no resemblance either in form or matter to that work;\r\nthe one consisting of isolated observations and of particular facts,\r\nand the other of general principles; and the style of the one being\r\ncomparatively full, whereas the other is remarkably succinct, so as\r\nto be nearly unintelligible in many places. Take the following as a\r\nspecimen of it: “The earth is to trees what the stomach is to animals;\r\nit nourishes, heats, and cools; cools when emptied, heats when filled,\r\nas the earth when manured is hot in winter, so is it with the stomach.”\r\nThis important observation, that the earth, in connection with the\r\nvegetable productions, is analogous to the stomach in animals, is\r\nrepeated by Aristotle and other of the ancient philosophers.[237] The\r\nauthor makes the important remark, (§ 14,) that we ought to study the\r\ncondition of the body previous to the season in which the disease broke\r\nout; in confirmation of which M. Littré, in his arguments, gives some\r\nvery interesting observations by M. Forster.[238] In the paragraph on\r\ndeposits, the author remarks, that in fevers attended with a feeling of\r\nlassitude, the deposits generally take place to the joints and jaws.\r\nIt is afterwards stated--and if confirmed by experience, as I think I\r\nhave observed it to be in many cases, it is an important remark--that\r\n“when the feet are hot, the depositions point downwards, but when cold,\r\nupwards.” § 7. In § 12 diseases are thus classified: “with regard to\r\nthe modes of diseases, some are congenital, as may be learned upon\r\ninquiry; some are connected with the nature of the locality, (for\r\nmany are affected, and therefore many are acquainted with them); some\r\nwith the condition of the body and the diet, the constitution of the\r\ndisease, and the seasons. The localities which are ill situated in\r\nrespect to the seasons engender diseases similar to the season; in\r\nlike manner, irregularities as to heat and cold in the same day when\r\nit has such effects, produce autumnal diseases in the locality, and\r\nin the other seasons likewise. The diseases which are engendered by\r\nfetid and marshy waters are calculus and splenic diseases, and such are\r\ninfluenced by good or bad winds.” Altogether, as will be readily seen,\r\nit is a work of great ability, and will amply repay a diligent perusal.\r\nGalen esteemed it very much, and did not hesitate to declare that, not\r\nonly Plato, Aristotle, and Theophrastus, but also several of the most\r\ndistinguished medical authors had copied freely from it.[239]\r\n\r\n\r\n          XXXV. Περὶ χρήσιος ὑγρῶν--_On the Use of Liquids_.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to be the work which appears in Erotian’s list under\r\nthe title of “On Waters” (περὶ ὑδατῶν); and, contrary to what is stated\r\nby Foës and Gruner, it is quoted by Galen in two places;[240] and it\r\nis further referred to by Athenæus, under the same title as that given\r\nto it by Erotian.[241] Foës pronounces it to be a mutilated work, and\r\none which is wanting in many of the MSS. of the Hippocratic treatises;\r\nand all the modern critics, from Lemos and Mercuriali down to Littré\r\nand Greenhill, regard it as spurious. Gruner speaks of it as being a\r\nwork of little importance, and Ackerman as being a mere compilation\r\nfrom the Aphorisms.[242] Gruner further remarks, that the title does\r\nnot suit well with its contents, and this is in so far correct, for\r\nundoubtedly the title given to it by Erotian is more suitable, as it\r\ntreats almost exclusively of the medicinal properties of waters; and\r\nthis it certainly does in a fuller and more interesting manner than\r\nthey are treated of in any other ancient, and, I may almost venture\r\nto add, any modern work with which I am acquainted. I look upon its\r\ncontents, then, as being extremely valuable, even as the work has\r\ncome down to us, but it is to be regretted that the text is in a very\r\nunsatisfactory state. Water the author of the treatise recommends as\r\na fomentation to the eyes, when applied with a sponge; and further,\r\nas a general or local fomentation, for producing relaxation of any\r\npart when contracted. When poured over the head, and other parts,\r\nit is said to induce sleep, is useful in convulsions, and relieves\r\npains of the eyes and ears. Cold water inflames ulcers, except such\r\nas have a tendency to hemorrhage, and also fractures, luxations, etc.\r\nIn applying water to the body, the author recommends the feelings of\r\nthe patient to be consulted, unless he be in a state of paralysis or\r\nof stupor, or be suffering from exposure to great cold, or be in great\r\npain. In these cases, he adds, the patient may be insensible, and\r\ninstances have occurred of persons having their feet congealed by cold,\r\nwhich have dropped off upon the affusion of hot water. The immoderate\r\nuse of hot water induces relaxation of the fleshy parts (muscles?),\r\nweakness of the nerves, torpor of the understanding, hemorrhage, and\r\ndeliquum animi, so as even to prove fatal; and much cold water will\r\noccasion spasms, tetanus, lividity, and febrile rigors. The parts of\r\nthe body which are usually covered endure the cold water worst, and\r\nare most refreshed by hot. Cold water disagrees with the brain and\r\nits processes, the bones, the teeth, and the nerves; and hence, it\r\nis added, convulsions, distentions, and febrile rigors, which are\r\ninduced by cold, are relieved by hot water. Hot water occasions delight\r\nand determination (to the skin?); cold, on the other hand, pain and\r\ndetermination inwardly: wherefore the loins, the breast, the back, and\r\nthe hypochondriac region, are injured by cold applications, but delight\r\nin warm. Cold water, thrown on the extremities, relieves lipothymia,\r\nthe reason of which he states, but the text is so corrupt that I dare\r\nnot undertake to translate the passage. Ulcers, excoriated parts of the\r\nbody, and burns, bear cold ill. The extremities, the bladder, and the\r\norgans of generation, delight in warm water. Salt water is proper to\r\nitchy parts, and to parts affected with pungent humors, but disagrees\r\nwith burns, and abraded surfaces. Vinegar is said to have much the\r\nsame properties as salt water in the cure of these complaints. Warm\r\nwater, in which salt has been melted, is beneficial in lichen, leprosy,\r\nalphos, and other complaints of a like nature. The lees of vinegar\r\n(_caustic potass_?) also answer in these cases. The astringency of\r\ncold water is increased by having beet leaves, ivy, bramble, sumach,\r\nsage, etc. boiled in it. Red pustules, like lentils, are benefited by\r\ncold things, but eruptions arising from cold, and resembling millet,\r\nare improved by hot. There are certain cases in which both hot and cold\r\nare applicable, such as gouty affections, and most sprains: in these,\r\ncold applications deaden the pain, and warm soothe it. Indurations and\r\nankyloses of a joint are to be removed by pouring warm water out of a\r\nvessel upon it. Rheums of the eyes are relieved by rubbing them with\r\nsome fatty substance, to obtund the acrimony of the tears. In pains,\r\nsuppurations, pungent tears, and deep ulcers of the eyes, hot water is\r\nmost expedient; when the eyes are merely red, and free of pain, cold\r\nis to be preferred. Cold does not agree with complaints of the rectum\r\nand uterus, nor with cases of bloody urine. Cold raises pain when it\r\nis applied to ulcers, hardens the skin, renders it painful, suppresses\r\nsuppuration, renders parts livid and black, is injurious in febrile\r\nrigors, spasms, and tetanus. But he adds, sometimes in a robust young\r\nman, in the middle of summer, when laboring under tetanus not connected\r\nwith a wound, the affusion of cold water brings back the heat. (See\r\nAphor. v., 21, and PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., 20). Hot water\r\ndoes the same. It promotes ulceration in all cases, softens the skin,\r\nattenuates it, is anodyne, and soothes rigors, spasms, and tetanus,\r\nand removes heaviness of the head. It is most particularly applicable\r\nin fractures, when the bone is laid bare, and especially in injuries\r\nof the head. Hot water agrees with all ulcerations, whether innate or\r\nproduced by artificial means, in herpes exedens, in blackened parts,\r\nand in diseases of the ears, anus, and womb. But cold water is inimical\r\nin all these cases, except when hemorrhage is apprehended.\r\n\r\nThe above is a brief summary of the matters contained in this little\r\ntreatise. That they are highly important, and evince an extraordinary\r\ntalent for apprehending the true bearing of practical points in\r\nmedicine, will hardly be denied by any person who is a competent judge.\r\nMany of the rules and observations contained in it are, no doubt,\r\nthe same as those found in the Aphorisms (see Section v.), but there\r\nis also no lack of valuable matter in it, which is not to be found\r\nelsewhere. Though I am disposed, then, to agree with the authorities\r\nwho exclude it from the list of genuine works, I do not hesitate to\r\ndeclare it as my decided opinion, that it is not unworthy of the\r\nreputation of the great Hippocrates, and that, if not written by him,\r\nit must be the production of some person who thoroughly apprehended\r\nhis high principles and discriminating views. How much, then, is it\r\nto be regretted, that this treatise should have come down to us in so\r\nmutilated a state that the meaning, in many places, can only be guessed\r\nat with considerable hesitation!\r\n\r\n\r\n                    XXXVI. Περὶ γονῆς--_On Semen_.\r\n\r\n      XXXVII. Περὶ φύσιος παιδίου--_On the Nature of the Infant_.\r\n\r\nThat these two treatises originally constituted one work, has been\r\nremarked by Foës, Gruner, Ackerman, Littré, and others. Indeed, this\r\nwill be made sufficiently obvious, upon comparing the conclusion of\r\nthe one with the beginning of the other. Galen, in one place,[243]\r\nquotes the former of these as if he held it to be a genuine work of\r\nHippocrates, but elsewhere he mentions that it had been referred to\r\nPolybus.[244] Erotian mentions, among the works of Hippocrates, a\r\ntreatise bearing the title of the latter, under which he probably\r\ncomprehended both treatises. It is also noticed as a Hippocratic\r\ntreatise by Palladius,[245] and by Macrobius.[246] Both are rejected\r\nby Haller, Gruner, Ackerman, Kühn, Littré, and Greenhill. Indeed the\r\nstory of the female musician, whom the author gravely admits that he\r\ntaught the way how to get rid of a conception,[247] is so alien to the\r\nmorals of Hippocrates, as declared in “The Oath,” that it is impossible\r\nfor a moment to suppose him guilty of such an act of flagitiousness.\r\nMoreover the treatise so abounds in little subtleties and conceits,\r\nespecially in reference to the Pythagorean doctrine of numbers, that\r\nno competent judge will hesitate for a moment in pronouncing it not\r\nto be the production of the Great Hippocrates.[248] Without doubt,\r\nhowever, these treatises are of great antiquity, and are valuable\r\nas containing the hypotheses with regard to the origin of the fœtus\r\nwhich prevailed in the schools down to the days of Harvey; that is to\r\nsay, that the embryo is formed from the male semen, into which the\r\nuterine vessels enter, and form the cotyledones (_or_ placenta).\r\nIt contains, moreover, an hypothesis adopted by Aristotle in several\r\nof his physiological works regarding the semen, namely, that it is\r\ncollected from all parts of the body; and hence, if any part be\r\nmutilated in the parent, it is so likewise in the fœtus.[249] The\r\nauthor moreover holds, that the fœtus breathes, and is nourished by\r\nthe umbilicus,[250] which may be looked upon as an anticipation of the\r\nmodern doctrine, that the placenta performs the function both of a lung\r\nand of an intestine. It contains a statement regarding the incubation\r\nof the egg, which has been often repeated in modern times, but which,\r\nfrom personal observation, I can affirm not to be true; namely, that\r\nthe hen chips the shell to let out the chick.[251] Presentations in\r\ndelivery are divided into those by the head, the feet, and crossways. I\r\nwould mention, in conclusion, that these works abound in repetitions,\r\nand are written in a diffuse style, very unlike that of Hippocrates.\r\nAltogether, then, I can have no hesitation in pronouncing both\r\ntreatises to be spurious. From what has been stated of them above, it\r\nmust be obvious, however, that to the student of ancient anatomy and\r\nphysiology they are very interesting, and will repay a careful perusal.\r\nAlthough, probably, later productions than the age of Hippocrates,\r\nthere can be no doubt that they are anterior to the memorable epoch of\r\nHerophilus and Erasistratus.\r\n\r\n\r\n         XXXVIII. Περὶ γυναικείων--_On the Diseases of Women_.\r\n\r\nWe have already stated in our critical remarks on the fourth book,\r\n“On Diseases,” that it and the present treatise are evidently the\r\nproductions of the same author. Although Erotian and Galen[252]\r\nmake reference to it as if acknowledging it to be the production of\r\nHippocrates, its claim is rejected by Foës, Schulze, Gruner, and\r\nAckerman, and all the modern authorities of any note. Its connection\r\nwith the treatises “De Genitura” and “De Natura Pueri,” is pointed out\r\nby Foës and Gruner; and Littré does not hesitate to refer to the same\r\nauthor the whole of the following treatises, “De Genitum,” “De Natura\r\nPueri,” “De Morbis,” iv., “De Morbis Mulierum,” “De Morbis Virginum,”\r\n“De Sterilibus.” Although not the composition of Hippocrates, all these\r\ntreatises are, without doubt, of high antiquity, and were anterior to\r\nthe age of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe work now under consideration contains much valuable matter, and\r\ndeserves a careful perusal. I feel rather at a loss what selections\r\nto make from it, as a specimen of its contents, but shall be brief\r\non the present occasion, more especially as I have no difficulty in\r\nestablishing the point, that the treatise in question is not one of the\r\ngenuine works of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nThe observations contained in the first part of it, on menstruation\r\nand the causes of sterility, are ingenious. For the cure of sterility,\r\nfumigation of the uterus is recommended, and a minute description\r\nis given of the mode of performing this process, by means of a tube\r\nintroduced into the os uteri, and connected with a vessel which emits\r\naromatic fumes. When sterility is connected with the shutting up of\r\nthe os uteri, the author gives directions for expanding it by means of\r\na wooden or leaden pipe. We need scarcely remark, that this practice\r\nhas been revived of late years. A minute description is given of a\r\nmalformation of the vagina, in which the passage is nearly obliterated\r\nby a membrane. Allusion is probably made here to a preternatural\r\nrigidity of the hymen. The author directs the membrane to be fairly\r\ntorn, and the part dressed with wine and myrrh. In transverse and\r\nfootling presentations of the child it will be best, he says, to bring\r\nit down by the head. Both cases are said to be dangerous, so that\r\neither the mother or child is lost, and sometimes both. Treating of\r\nretention of the placenta, the author remarks, that if it is not cast\r\noff it becomes putrid, and thus comes away on the sixth or seventh\r\nday, or later. To promote its expulsion, he recommends southernwood,\r\ndittany, the flowers of the white violet, and asafœtida. The process\r\nof abortion, and the unpleasant circumstances connected with retention\r\nof the placenta in this case, are given with much accuracy. Hydrops\r\nuteri is described at considerable length. For an account of it, see\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol I., p. 573, Syd. Soc. edition, and the\r\nmodern authorities there referred to. For ulcers of the womb, he\r\nrecommends applications consisting of many stimulating ingredients,\r\nsuch as the flos argenti, etc. The subject of difficult delivery is\r\nresumed; when the arm or leg of a living child is protruding, it is\r\ndirected to be pushed back, and the child turned to the head; and if\r\nthe fœtus be dead, either the same thing may be done, or the projecting\r\npart may be cut off, and the head opened with a sharp knife, and the\r\nbones thereof extracted, and the body brought along. The chest also\r\nmay be opened, if there be any difficulty in extracting the body.\r\nThe author expresses himself strongly in regard to the danger of\r\nabortions. All abortions, he says, are attended with more danger than\r\ndeliveries at the full time. Artificial abortion never takes place\r\nwithout violence, whether produced by medicine, a draught, or food, or\r\na suppository, or any other means.\r\n\r\nThe second book commences with a description of fluor albus, an\r\naffection to which the old are stated to be more subject than the\r\nyoung. It arises from suppression of the menses, from parturition,\r\nor a fever. Among other means which he speaks of for the cure of it,\r\nhe mentions the application of cupping-instruments to the mammæ.\r\nAstringents from the vegetable kingdom are to be administered, such\r\nas sumach boiled in vinegar, mulberries, or the like. A full account\r\nof the red fluor, _or_ uterine hemorrhage, is also given. It is\r\nsaid to be connected principally with parturition. The treatment which\r\nis recommended can scarcely be improved upon, even after the lapse\r\nof two thousand years: a sponge is to be wetted and applied to the\r\npudenda; soft garments are to be moistened with cold water, and laid\r\non the belly; and _the foot of the bed is to be raised_. When the\r\nhemorrhage is connected with putridity many women thus perish, indeed\r\nfew recover. A long description is given of hysterical convulsions\r\nwhich is said principally to attack antiquated maids and widows. It is\r\nremarked that hysterical complaints bring on cough, and other pectoral\r\ncomplaints. A very striking and accurate description is given of\r\nprocidentia uteri. Inflation of the womb is also described. On it see\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., p. 632, Syd. Soc. edition. There is\r\nalso a curious description of the mole. The clitoris is described under\r\nthe name of columna.[253]\r\n\r\nFrom the extracts now given, it will be seen that these Books contain\r\na great variety of most important matter. Indeed, there are few\r\ntreatises in the Collection more deserving of an attentive perusal.\r\nThey furnish the most indubitable proofs that the obstetrical art had\r\nbeen cultivated with most extraordinary ability at an early period.\r\nBeyond all doubts the complaints of women, and the accidents attending\r\nparturition, must at that time have come under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe male practitioner. But, considering the wandering life which\r\nHippocrates led, and that during the best part of it he must have been\r\nwhat is now called a consulting physician, it is not at all likely\r\nthat he could have acquired that acquaintance with the minutiæ of\r\nobstetrical practice which this work displays. It is not, then, at all\r\nprobable that he can be the author of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                XXXIX. Περὶ ἀφόρων--_On Sterile Women_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise is closely connected with the preceding one, both in\r\nmatter and style. It relates to a subject which, as we have shown, is\r\nalso treated of in the other work, I mean sterility, the most common\r\ncause of which is held to be the state of the os uteri, when it is\r\noblique to the passages of the vagina, constricted from cicatrices,\r\nor otherwise diseased. Distinct directions are given for opening the\r\nmouth of the womb, after which a cleansing application, composed of\r\ncantharides and myrrh, is to be made to it. The mole, and procidentia\r\nuteri, are described in nearly the same terms as in the preceding\r\ntreatise. Though it bears a great resemblance, then, to the work “On\r\nthe Diseases of Women,” it is not likely, as suggested by Albertus\r\nFabricius,[254] that it is an appendix to it, for why should an author\r\ntreat twice of the same subject in the same work?\r\n\r\n\r\n        XL. Περὶ παρθενίων--_On the Complaints of Young Women._\r\n\r\nFoës looks upon this little tract as being the prelude to the greater\r\nwork “On the Diseases of Women.” It is destitute of all claims to\r\nbe held as genuine, and accordingly no critic, ancient or modern,\r\nstands up for it. Gruner is inclined to ascribe it to the author of\r\nthe treatise “On the Sacred Disease,” but I see no grounds for this\r\nopinion, except it be that, in the two treatises, there is a certain\r\nsimilarity of views with regard to the nature of the hysterical\r\nconvulsion. This, however, is not a sufficient reason for deciding that\r\nthey both must have come from the same source, for all the ancient\r\nauthorities, from Hippocrates to Actuarius, held pretty much the same\r\nideas regarding the nature of “Uterine suffocation.” See PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, III., 71. The author of this little fragment gives very\r\nnaïve advice to virgins who are subject to hysterics; instead of making\r\ncostly oblations of garments and the like to Diana, as recommended by\r\nthe prophets, he gravely advises them ὡς ταχίστα συνοικῆσαι ἀνδρασι.\r\n\r\n\r\n               XLI. Περὶ ἐπικυήσιος--_On Superfœtation._\r\n\r\nThis treatise, I believe, is not mentioned by any one of the ancient\r\nauthorities, and it is almost universally rejected by the modern.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely remark that it relates to a very curious subject, and\r\nthat great doubts are now entertained whether or not superfœtation\r\nin women ever actually takes place. I can state, however, that two\r\ntrustworthy persons, the one a surgeon and the other a _sage\r\nfemme_, informed me, some years ago, that they once attended\r\ntogether a case in which a woman was first delivered of a fœtus about\r\nfour months old, and, about thirty-six hours afterwards, of a fully\r\ngrown child. The ancient _savants_ all believed in the occurrence\r\nof superfœtation. See in particular Aristotle (Hist. Anim. vii., 5);\r\nand Pliny, (H. N., vii., 11.)\r\n\r\nThe following are a few of the most interesting observations which\r\nI have remarked in perusing this treatise. When the secundines are\r\nevacuated before the child, they cause difficult parturition, and the\r\ncase is dangerous unless the head present. Presentations of the hand\r\nand foot are directed to be replaced. When the placenta is retained\r\nafter the expulsion of the child, the child is to be laid upon wool,\r\nor upon two bladders, filled with water, either of which is to be\r\npricked, so that the water may run off gradually, and thus draw down\r\nthe placenta. When there is a copious discharge of blood before labor,\r\nthere is a risk that the child may be dead, or at least not viable.\r\nWhen women with child long for coals, the appearance of these things\r\nis to be seen on the child’s head. (For the opinions of the ancients\r\non the effect of imagination on the fœtus in utero, see the commentary\r\non B. I., § 1, of PAULUS ÆGINETA, Syd. Soc. edition.) Some\r\nridiculous things are contained in this work, such as the following;\r\nwhen a man wishes to beget a male child let his left testicle be tied,\r\nand when a female the right.[255] The composition of suppositories\r\nfor cleansing the uterus is described at considerable length towards\r\nthe end of the treatise. Altogether, the work is by no means devoid\r\nof interest, but, as I have already said, it is certainly not the\r\ncomposition of Hippocrates. Littré, on the authority of the passage\r\nquoted from Aristotle on this head, refers the treatise to Leophanes.\r\nFrom the account which we have given of its contents, it will be\r\nremarked that the title and contents of it do not well accord together.\r\nThis remark, however, applies to other of the Hippocratic treatises\r\nbesides the one we are now treating of.\r\n\r\n\r\n            XLII. Περὶ γυναικείης--_On the Female Nature_.\r\n\r\nAs Foës remarks, this work is mostly made up of excerpts from the\r\ntreatise “De Muliebribus.” I need not, therefore, occupy time in\r\ndiscussing its claims to be regarded as genuine, nor in giving an\r\noutline of its contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XLIII. Περὶ καρδίης--_On the Heart_.\r\n\r\nGalen, in one place, appears to cite a passage in this treatise, but\r\nwithout naming it.[256] It is not found in Erotian’s list, and all the\r\nmodern authorities, including even Foës, who is more disposed than\r\nmost of the others to deal leniently with the claims of the treatises\r\nwhich bear the name of Hippocrates, concur in refusing to admit it\r\nas genuine. Still, however, there can be no question as to its being\r\na work of very high antiquity. It is to be regretted, then, that the\r\ntext is in a very unsatisfactory state. It contains, upon the whole, a\r\nwonderfully accurate description of all the parts about the heart--of\r\nits substance, which is said to be a strong muscle; of its pericardium,\r\nwhich is described as being a smooth tunic, containing a little fluid\r\nresembling urine; of its ventricles (γαστέρες); of its auricles\r\n(ὄυατα); of the origin of the veins from it; of its sigmoid valves; of\r\nits office, to be, as it were, the fountain head, from which all parts\r\nof the body are irrigated, and the seat of the understanding, which\r\nis said to be in the left ventricle. The understanding, it is added,\r\nis not nourished by the blood, but by a pure and luminous (φωτοειδὴς)\r\nsuperfluity from it. Altogether, this little treatise bespeaks much\r\npractical acquaintance with human anatomy, and, considering the age\r\nin which it was written, must be the production of a very superior\r\nmind. It contains an account of an experiment which has been much\r\nanimadverted upon, both by ancient and modern authorities. The writer\r\nsays, if a colored fluid be given to an animal, such as a sow, to\r\ndrink, and if its throat be cut while it is in the act of swallowing,\r\nit will be found that part of the fluid has passed down by the gullet\r\nto the lungs. See in particular Aulus Gellius (Noctes Atticæ, xvii.,\r\n11); Macrobius (Saturnal. vii., 15); and Plutarch (Sympos. vii., 1.)\r\nAulus Gellius says decidedly that Plato had adopted this opinion from\r\nHippocrates. Aulus Gellius and Macrobius also quote Plutarch as having\r\nstated, in his ‘Symposiacon,’ that Hippocrates is the author of this\r\nopinion; but the text of Plutarch (l.c.) is in an unsatisfactory state.\r\nSee Schulze (Hist. Med. i., iii., vi., 12.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XLIV. Περὶ τροφῆς--_On Aliment_.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that this treatise has very high authorities\r\nin favor of its authenticity, such as Erotian, Galen,[257] Aulus\r\nGellius,[258] Palladius,[259] Stephanus;[260] and, in modern times,\r\nMercuriali, Foës, Haller, and Le Clerc.[261] It is rejected by Casper\r\nHoffman,[262] Gruner, Ackerman, Kühn, Littré, and Greenhill, though,\r\nby the last two, not in decided terms. Considering the respectability\r\nof the external evidence in its favor, I should certainly not have\r\nhesitated in admitting it as genuine, had not a careful examination\r\nof its contents led me to form the unbiassed decision that it\r\nmust be the production of some metaphysician, rather than of a\r\nmedical practitioner, such as we know Hippocrates to have been. The\r\nphysiological dogmata with which it abounds are announced in so\r\nantithetical, not to say paradoxical, a manner, that I can conceive\r\nnothing more foreign to the style and character of the true writings of\r\nHippocrates. I shall give a few specimens:--“The species of aliment is\r\none and many; all these (kinds of aliment?) are one nature and not one.\r\nPurging is upwards and downwards, and neither upwards nor downwards.\r\nPurging in aliment is excellent, purging in aliment is bad. Aliment\r\nnot aliment, unless it conveys nourishment; it is aliment in name but\r\nnot in deed; aliment in deed and no longer in name only. Sweet and\r\nnot sweet; sweet potentially, as water, sweet to the taste, as honey.\r\nThings not animals are animated; animals are animated, the parts of\r\nanimals are animated. It (the embryo) is and is not.” Now, I must say,\r\nthat all this appears to me to savour more of the taste of Democritus\r\nthan of Hippocrates himself. It may be said, indeed, that the very\r\ncircumstance of Galen’s having admitted the work as genuine, and\r\nhaving composed an elaborate commentary on it, is a most presumptive\r\nproof of its authenticity; for where shall we find so excellent a\r\njudge of the doctrines of Hippocrates as his great commentator? But\r\nthen it must be taken into account that Galen himself had a great\r\n_penchant_ towards metaphysical subtleties, and this would lead\r\nhim to believe that what was in accordance with his own tastes must\r\nhave been in accordance with those of his great professional hero.\r\nBut, notwithstanding the doubts which hang over the question of its\r\nauthorship, it may be confidently affirmed regarding this treatise\r\nthat, illustrated as it is by Galen’s commentary (even although it has\r\ncome down to us in a mutilated state), few works in the Collection are\r\nmore suggestive than the present one. I shall merely give a few more\r\nspecimens of it:--“The root of the veins is the liver, and the root of\r\nthe arteries is the heart; and from them blood and spirits are carried\r\nto all parts, and heat passes to the same.” This passage is frequently\r\nquoted and commented upon by ancient authors; as by Galen,[263] and\r\nAretæus.[264] We have seen it stated in the preceding treatise that\r\nthe heart is the place from which both veins and arteries originate.\r\nThis seems a presumptive proof that these two treatises must have\r\nhad a distinct authorship. “The aliment reaches to the hairs, the\r\nnails, and the outer surfaces from within; and aliment from without\r\npasses from the most external to the most internal parts, there is one\r\nconflux and one conspiration (ξύρροια μία, ξύμπνοια μία). All parts\r\nsympathize throughout the whole frame, but in so far every part has\r\nits own peculiar action.” This passage, also, is very celebrated and\r\nfrequently quoted.[265] I need scarcely remark that it embraces a\r\ngrand and most important view of the animal economy. “Milk is food to\r\nsome with whom it agrees, and to others not. To some wine is food, and\r\nto others not; and so with flesh and many other kinds of aliment. We\r\nmust look to situation and habit. Humidity is the vehicle of food. The\r\nnatures (instincts?) of all things are untaught. Persons who perspire\r\nfreely are weak, more healthy, and have easier recoveries than others.\r\nThose who perspire ill are stronger than others before they become\r\nindisposed, but being indisposed have more difficult recoveries. These\r\nremarks apply to the whole and to the parts.”\r\n\r\nFrom these specimens it will be readily seen that the work abounds\r\nin curious matters, but of a very different stamp from those which\r\nthe true Hippocratic treatises contain. Contrary, then, to my general\r\nrule, I certainly feel disposed in the present instance to reject,\r\nupon internal evidence, a treatise which has the most unexceptionable\r\nexternal evidence in its favor.\r\n\r\n\r\n        XLV. Περὶ σαρκῶν, ἤ ἀρχῶν--_On Fleshes, or Principles_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise does not appear in Erotian’s list of the Hippocratic\r\nworks, and it is rejected by all the modern authorities, from\r\nMercuriali downwards. Galen is inconsistent in his notice of it.[266]\r\nSome of the philosophical dogmata which it contains are curious, such\r\nas the following specimen: “It appears to me that what we call heat\r\nis immortal, and that it knows all, sees, hears, and perceives all\r\nthings that are and will be.[267] When things, then, were thrown into\r\nconfusion the greater part of this passed off to the highest circle,\r\nand this it is which the ancients called ether.” The following extract\r\nis held by Gruner, but probably without any good reason, to evince a\r\ndegree of anatomical knowledge in advance of the age of Hippocrates:\r\n“There are two hollow veins from the heart, the one called the artery,\r\nand the other the vena cava. The artery has more heat than the vein.”\r\nThe other veins are also described with considerable accuracy. It is\r\nstated that the fœtus in utero sucks in fluid (liquor amnii?) by its\r\nlips, and in proof of this the author remarks that the child voids\r\nfæces soon after delivery, which, it is argued, must be derived from\r\nfood. The opinion thus stated has been often maintained in modern\r\ntimes, but does not appear to be well founded. The author mentions\r\ncorrectly that persons in attempting to commit suicide open the\r\ntrachea, in which case, he adds, the patient lives, but loses his voice\r\nuntil the opening be closed. Conringius and Haller, with considerable\r\nplausibility, but yet without any direct proof, attribute this treatise\r\nto Democritus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XLVI. Περὶ ἑβδομάδων--_On Hebdomads_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise exists now only in the Latin translation, which M.\r\nLittré has discovered in the Royal (_National_, it is now called!)\r\nLibrary in Paris, and will be published in his edition of the works\r\nof Hippocrates. M. Littré gives an elaborate and most interesting\r\ndisquisition on it, and seems to make out clearly that it is the\r\nproduction of the same author as the treatise “On Fleshes,” which we\r\nlast noticed. It is cited by Philo Judæus,[268] and several other\r\nwriters of antiquity. Galen, however, held it not to be the production\r\nof Hippocrates. A considerable extract from it is contained in the\r\ntract “On Critical Days,” and the eighth section of the Aphorisms,\r\nwhich has always been looked upon as spurious, is said by M. Littré to\r\nbe mostly taken from this treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XLVII. Περὶ ἀδένων--_On the Glands_.\r\n\r\nErotian makes no mention of this treatise, and Galen pronounces it to\r\nbe the work of the recent Hippocratists.[269] M. Littré remarks, and\r\nwith great truth, that it is difficult to find out the grounds upon\r\nwhich the ancient critics have rejected this work. Certain it is that\r\nit contains a goodly store of interesting matters, none of which, as\r\nfar as I can discover, are inconsistent with the true doctrines of\r\nHippocrates. In it a pretty correct description is given of the glands,\r\nincluding those of the mesentery. The brain itself is said to be of\r\nglandular nature, and also the kidneys. An ingenious account is also\r\ngiven of the origin of scrofula, which is said to be produced by the\r\nlodgment of humors in the glands of the neck, which get into a state\r\nof slow inflammation. Glands, the author says, are seated mostly in\r\nparts of the body which most abound in humidities, such as the armpits\r\nand groins, and hence such parts produce hairs. In the case of the\r\nmesentery, however, no hairs are produced, because the humidities here\r\nare excessive, and choke up, as it were, the seeds of the hairs; in\r\nlike manner as seeds sown in marshy grounds perish. A very ingenious\r\naccount is given of the origin of phthisis, which is said to spring\r\nfrom tubercles in the lungs and matter (pus), which corrodes the lungs\r\nwhen “the patients do not readily recover.” A curious description is\r\nnext given of the tabes dorsalis, “in which disease the patient does\r\nnot wish to live.” How expressive this language is of the state of mind\r\nin the case of the unfortunates who are subject to spermatorrhœa! The\r\ntreatise concludes with some striking remarks on the sympathy between\r\nthe mammæ and uterus, and on the influence which both exercise on the\r\ndevelopment of the female character. Altogether the contents of this\r\ntreatise are most valuable, and may suggest important views to the\r\nmedical practitioner and physiologist, even at the present day. We need\r\nhave no hesitation in pronouncing, with regard to it, that it reflects\r\ninfinite credit on the school from which it emanated, and that it is\r\nnot unworthy of Hippocrates, although we have reason to believe that he\r\nwas not actually the author of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XLVIII. Περὶ φλεβῶν--_On the Veins_.\r\n\r\nThis is merely an excerpt from the treatise “On the Nature of the\r\nBones.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                XLIX. Περὶ ἰητροῦ--_On the Physician_.\r\n\r\nI may mention in this place, generally, that the treatises which follow\r\nhave no ancient authority in support of them, and that, with very few\r\nexceptions, they are also rejected by all the modern critics. Their\r\ncontents, moreover, are not of much practical importance, and therefore\r\nI shall be very brief in my analysis of them.\r\n\r\nThe treatise in question is held to be genuine by no one critic, as\r\nfar as I know, with the exception of Foës, who appears, in part, to\r\nsanction its claims. The object of the author is announced to be in\r\norder to instruct the physician how to conduct matters connected\r\nwith the iatrium, that is to say, with his establishment or surgery.\r\nMercuriali, I may mention, is unjustly severe in his animadversions on\r\nthe exordium. (See Conringius, Introd. p. 120.) The physician should\r\nhave a healthy look himself, for the writer says, people fancy that\r\na person who does not keep himself in good health is not qualified\r\nto take charge of the health of others. He should be of a prudent\r\ndisposition and a gentleman in morals.[270] Minute directions are given\r\nrespecting the site and other circumstances connected with the iatrium:\r\nclean and soft towels are to be at hand, linen is to be used for the\r\neyes, and sponges for the sores. In supplying bandages, attention is\r\nto be paid to utility rather than to display. The surgeon should pay\r\ngreat attention to all matters connected with this operation: for it is\r\nattended with much disgrace when any manual operation does not succeed.\r\nMinute directions are given about the performance of venesection at\r\nthe arm, and mention is made of several untoward accidents connected\r\nwith it, such as the blowing up of the vein, whereby the flow of\r\nblood is stopped; and suppuration following as a consequence of the\r\noperation. In order to acquire dexterity in the treatment of accidents,\r\nthe author recommends the young physician to attach himself to some\r\nforeign army; and from this Gruner infers, that the work cannot belong\r\nto Hippocrates, as domestic wars were but too common in his time; and\r\nthere could have been no necessity for the surgeon’s seeking foreign\r\nservice in order to gain experience. It does not occur to me, however,\r\nthat there is much force in this argument; for intervals of peace were\r\njust as common during the long life of Hippocrates, as during the\r\ninterval between his death and the time when the Collection was made.\r\nBut, in fact, there is no necessity to seek recondite reasons for\r\nrejecting a treatise which has no proper authority in support of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  L. Περὶ εὐσχημοσύνης--_On Decorum_.\r\n\r\nThis work, like the last, has not the slightest claim to be\r\nlooked upon as genuine. Moreover, it has come down to us in a very\r\nunsatisfactory state as regards the text, so that the meaning is often\r\nvery dark and uncertain; and I must confess that, as a general rule, I\r\nhave little inclination to spend much time in searching out a meaning,\r\nin obscure writings, when, after it is discovered, it is not likely\r\nto repay the exertions made in discovering it. I am always disposed\r\nto remember the advice which Galen repeatedly gives to the student of\r\nmedicine, “to concern himself more about things than about words.”[271]\r\nThe object of the author seems to be to give general directions with\r\nregard to decorum in the physician’s communication with the sick. It\r\nis evidently the production of some sophist, according to Bernard, of\r\nsome one belonging to the Stoical sect. I shall be brief in my abstract\r\nof it. A philosophical physician is equal to a god. In the practice\r\nof medicine all the virtues relating to wisdom are exercised; namely,\r\ncontempt of money, decency, modesty, simplicity in dress, character,\r\njudgment, quietness, accessibility, purity of life, sententious maxims,\r\nknowledge of the purifications which are proper and necessary in life,\r\nabstinence from lucre, freedom from superstition, divine excellence.\r\nThe physician should keep himself aloof, and not hold much converse\r\nwith the common people, unless when necessary. The surgeon should\r\nbe well provided with all the means required in the practice of his\r\nprofession, such as dressings, medicines, instruments, and so forth,\r\nas any deficiency in these might produce serious results. Minute\r\ndirections are given for the regulation of the physician’s address in\r\nentering the chamber of the sick, and his conduct while there.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LI. Παραγγέλιαι--_Precepts_.\r\n\r\nThis little tract stands altogether in much the same circumstances as\r\nthe preceding one, that is to say, it is wholly destitute of all good\r\nauthority in its favor, and the nature of its contents is what might\r\nrather be expected from a sophist than a practical physician. The text,\r\nmoreover, is in a most unsatisfactory state. I shall dismiss it then\r\nwith a very brief notice. It opens with an advice to the physician not\r\nto trust to speculation but to rational experience. He ought to learn\r\nremedies from all quarters, even from the vulgar, and not be avaricious\r\nin his dealings with the sick, more especially if strangers and needy.\r\nThe author alludes, as Schulze thinks, to the practice then followed\r\nby the physicians of migrating from one city to another, and of making\r\na public declaration of their pretensions at their first entry into\r\nany place. These physicians were called _periodeutæ_. The author\r\nof this tract advises the physician, in such a case, not to make any\r\nvainglorious or inflated profession of his abilities. He also enjoins\r\nthe medical practitioner to look to the health of those who are free\r\nfrom disease, as well as those who was indisposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LII. Περὶ ἀνατομῆς--_On Dissection_.\r\n\r\nThis small fragment of ancient anatomical science has no claim to be\r\nregarded as the work of Hippocrates. Neither Erotian nor Galen, nor\r\nany other ancient critic, holds it as such, and the modern authorities\r\nare unanimous in rejecting it. That it may have been the composition\r\nof Democritus, as suggested by Gruner, seems not unlikely. It abounds\r\nin harsh and obsolete terms, which have never been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. Some parts of the anatomical description are difficult to\r\ndetermine, as for example, “the large bronchia which extend from the\r\nheart to the liver;” “the vena scalena, which extends from the liver to\r\nthe kidneys.” The latter passage, however, may be supposed to refer to\r\nthe emulgent vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                LIII. Περὶ ὀδοντοφυίης--_On Dentition_.\r\n\r\nThis little tract is destitute of any competent evidence of its\r\nauthenticity. Some of the observations contained in it bespeak a\r\nfamiliar acquaintance with the diseases of infancy. Thus it is\r\nsaid, that when the bowels are loose at the term of dentition, if\r\nthe digestion be good, the children thrive, and are not subject to\r\nconvulsions. When children at the breast vomit up their food, the\r\nbowels are constipated. When there is fever accompanying dentition,\r\nchildren are seldom attacked with convulsions. But when there is heavy\r\nsleep along with dentition, there is danger of convulsions. All the\r\nchildren that are seized with convulsions at the time of dentition do\r\nnot die. Children that take food during dentition bear vomiting best.\r\nUlcers on the tonsils are attended with danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n      LIV. Περὶ ἐγκατοτὸμης άμβρύου--_On Excision of the Fœtus_.\r\n\r\nNo one stands up for the genuineness of this treatise,[272] which,\r\nhowever, is not wanting in interesting matter relative to the\r\nextraction of the fœtus in cross-presentations. For an abstract of the\r\npractice there recommended, see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. II., p.\r\n389, Syd. Soc. edition. A circumstantial description is also given of\r\nthe process of _succussion_, the dangerous effects of which, in\r\ncertain cases, are related in the Epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LV. Περὶ ὄψιος--_On Vision_.\r\n\r\nThis little fragment is admitted by all the authorities to be\r\nspurious. It contains a description of glaucoma, for which purging of\r\nthe head and the application of the actual cautery are recommended, and\r\nalso in certain cases venesection. In epidemic ophthalmy, purging both\r\nof the head and bowels is recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\n        LVI. Περὶ ὀστέων φύσιος--_On the Nature of the Bones_.\r\n\r\nM. Littré has very ingeniously shown that this work is a compilation\r\nmade up of fragments of other works, and thus he has announced his\r\nintention of excluding it altogether from the Hippocratic Collection.\r\nCertain it is, beyond all dispute, that the treatise is not the\r\nproduction of Hippocrates himself. The following are a few of the most\r\nnotable things which I have observed in it. “It appears to me that what\r\nwe call heat is immortal, and that it understands, sees, hears, and\r\nperceives all things that are and will be.” The heat, it is further\r\nsaid, is the origin of all movement in animals. This will be recognized\r\nas the original of the doctrine of the _Calidum innatum_, which\r\nfigures in the works of our earlier physiologists in modern times. See\r\nthe works of Harvey and the other physiologists of the seventeenth\r\ncentury; also what is said on this subject in the next section. The\r\naorta and vena cava are correctly described, the one as an artery, the\r\nother as a vein; and their origin from the ventricles of the heart is\r\nnoticed. The author states (p. 440, ed. Kühn), that he had known cases\r\nof attempted suicide in which the windpipe had been opened, and yet\r\ndeath did not ensue; only while the opening remained the person lost\r\nthe power of speaking. See No. XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 LVII. Περὶ κρισίων--_On the Crises_.\r\n\r\nThis tract has no ancient authority whatever in support of it, and\r\nFoës, Gruner, and Littré concur in holding it to be a compilation\r\nfrom other Hippocratic treatises, more especially the Aphorisms and\r\nPrognostics. This, indeed, must be obvious to every person who reads it\r\nwith any attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n               LVIII. Περὶ κρισίμων--_On Critical Days_.\r\n\r\nThis treatise stands in the same predicament as the preceding one,\r\nthat is to say, it has no ancient authority in support of it; indeed\r\nGalen declares against it when he says that Hippocrates had not given\r\nany work on the Critical Days. (Tom. iii., p. 440; ed. Basil.) It is\r\nmanifestly a compilation from the other treatises, more especially from\r\nthose “On Internal Diseases” and “On Diseases.” Still it appears to\r\nme to be an interesting and well-written compilation. For example, it\r\nwould be difficult to point out in any other work, ancient or modern,\r\na better description of pneumonia than is given towards the conclusion\r\nof it. Tetanus also is accurately described. To be sure, Gruner\r\ninfers, from the circumstance that three varieties of this disease\r\nare described, that the work in question must have emanated from the\r\nCnidian school. But Aretæus, and, indeed, all the ancient authorities\r\nthat treat of tetanus, describe three varieties of this disease; and\r\ntherefore this is no good reason for excluding it from the Coan school.\r\n\r\n\r\n             LIX. Περὶ φαρμάκων--_On Purgative Medicines_.\r\n\r\nThough it must be admitted that this little fragment can boast of no\r\ncompetent authorities to establish its claim to be placed among the\r\ngenuine works of Hippocrates, it bears undoubted marks of having been\r\nwritten by some person well acquainted with his principles, and having\r\nno ordinary acquaintance with professional matters. Thus the author\r\nstates very correctly the effects of idiosyncrasy in modifying the\r\noperation both of purgatives and emetics, and advises the physician to\r\nmake inquiry beforehand what effects such medicines, if formerly taken,\r\nhad produced on the patient; for, he adds, it would be a disgraceful\r\ncasualty to occasion a man’s death by the administration of a purgative\r\nmedicine. He also interdicts the administration of purgatives during\r\nthe heat of a fever, and during the very hot seasons of the year.\r\nThese practical rules appear to me to be highly important, and yet how\r\nfrequently do we see them disregarded! At the time we have mentioned,\r\nthe author prudently remarks that it is safer to administer a clyster.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LX. Περὶ ἑλλεβορισμοῦ--_On the Administration of Hellebore_.\r\n\r\nThis little tract is usually published among the _Epistolæ_, and,\r\nas a matter of course, it has no evidence in support of its genuineness\r\nfurther than they have, which, as we shall presently see, is very\r\nslender. It contains, however, very acute and important observations\r\non the administration of hellebore, to which it is well known that\r\nthe Hippocratists were very partial. But these are mostly extracted\r\nfrom the Aphorisms, and need not be noticed in this place. The Book of\r\nPrognostics also is quoted, but seemingly by mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LXI. Ἐπιστολαι--_The Epistles_.\r\n\r\nNo scholar can require to be informed that, since the memorable\r\ncontroversy in this country between the Honorable C. Boyle and the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Bentley, respecting the authenticity of the Epistles\r\nwhich bear the name of Phalaris, the whole of the “Epistolæ Græcanicæ”\r\nhave been generally condemned as spurious. Against this judgment I\r\nhave no intention to protest; but I may be allowed to remark that\r\nmany ancient works which are usually acknowledged as genuine have not\r\nso much external evidence in their favor as these Epistles possess.\r\nThe Epistles ascribed to Plato, for example, are quoted as genuine\r\nby Cicero,[273] and by Diogenes Laertius.[274] Those of Hippocrates,\r\ntoo, are quoted and recognized by Erotian, Soranus, and other ancient\r\nauthorities. Still, however, as I have stated, I have no intention to\r\nstand up against the general opinion of scholars from the Scaligers\r\ndown to the present time, by which they have been condemned as\r\nsupposititious; only I contend that, as it is admitted on all hands\r\nthat they are very ancient,[275] that is to say, that they must have\r\nbeen composed within less than a hundred years after the death of\r\nHippocrates, it is utterly incredible that the Sophists who wrote\r\nthem, whether for a fraudulent purpose that they might derive profit\r\nfrom them by passing them off for the productions of the great name\r\nthey bear, or whether for the purpose of displaying their own skill\r\nin sustaining an assumed character, should have made them turn upon\r\nalleged occurrences in the life of Hippocrates which every person\r\nat that early period must have been able to judge whether they were\r\nfictitious or not. I see no reason, then, to doubt that the main\r\nfacts to which these Epistles relate are real, although the Epistles\r\nthemselves be supposititious.[276]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving thus stated my opinion of these Epistles in general terms, I\r\nshall now dismiss them with a very brief notice.\r\n\r\nThey are differently arranged by modern authorities; I shall follow M.\r\nLittré in the few remarks which I have to offer upon them.\r\n\r\nThe first series of these Epistles relates to the services which\r\nHippocrates is said to have rendered to the people of Athens during\r\nthe time of the memorable plague. The spuriousness of these, it is\r\ngenerally held, is proved beyond all doubt by the silence of Thucydides\r\nwith regard to any such professional services rendered by Hippocrates\r\non the occasion; and no doubt if it were maintained that these took\r\nplace at the outbreak of the disease in Greece, that is to say, at the\r\ncommencement of the Peloponnesian war, the inference would be most\r\nlegitimate. But if we be permitted to suppose that, as the plague\r\nis known to have lurked about in different parts of Greece for a\r\nconsiderable time, the services of Hippocrates did not take place until\r\nseveral years afterwards, there is nothing in the story which bears the\r\nslightest air of falsehood, even if we adhere to the common chronology\r\nrespecting the birth of our author. Indeed, I repeat, if the Sophist\r\nwho composed these letters had founded them on tales which everybody\r\nknew to be false, he could never have hoped to impose upon the learned\r\nmen of the next generation, and make his forgeries pass for genuine.\r\n\r\nThe second series relates to Democritus, and these must be admitted\r\nto be the most interesting of the whole group. Now that Hippocrates\r\nvisited Abdera, and that he was familiarly acquainted with Democritus,\r\nare facts which the most sceptical critic will hardly venture to call\r\nin question.[277] But that the Epistles themselves were not written by\r\nthe physician and philosopher whose name they bear, I readily admit to\r\nbe probable. Most undoubtedly the letter of Hippocrates, in which he\r\nis made to describe his visit to Democritus, however full it may be\r\nof curious matters, is written in a style and manner very unlike the\r\nwell-known characters of the true writings of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nThird. The short letter inscribed from Hippocrates to his son\r\nThessalus, contains nothing from which its authenticity or the contrary\r\ncould be legitimately inferred, only it is destitute of all ancient\r\nauthority in its favor. In it the father recommends to the son the\r\nstudy of geometry and arithmetic, as a proper preparation to the study\r\nof medicine.\r\n\r\nFourth. This series, consisting of “The Oration at the Altar,” “The\r\nDecree of the Athenians,” and “The Oration of Thessalus, son of\r\nHippocrates,” although now generally regarded as spurious, possess\r\nmore direct evidence in their favor than any of the others. In fact,\r\nthey are decidedly recognized as genuine by Erotian. The documents\r\nin question have all reference to the services of Hippocrates and\r\nhis disciples in the pestilence which pervaded Greece during the\r\nPeloponnesian war. These services are alluded to by many ancient\r\nauthorities, as we have shown in the Commentary on PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Book II., § 35. In conclusion, I repeat that, supported\r\nas the main facts referred to in these documents are by the highest\r\ntestimony which antiquity can furnish, I cannot but regard the facts as\r\ntrue, although the documents themselves be given up as supposititious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will now briefly recapitulate the general results of the\r\ninvestigations on which I have been occupied in the present section:\r\n\r\n1. That all the authorities, ancient and modern, who have investigated\r\nthe question regarding the genuineness of the works which have\r\ncome down to us under the name of Hippocrates, are agreed that a\r\nconsiderable portion of them are not the productions of the author\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n2. That it is almost universally admitted that the following treatises\r\nare genuine, viz.:\r\n\r\n    The Prognostics.\r\n    On Airs, etc.\r\n    On Regimen in Acute Diseases.\r\n    Seven of the Books of Aphorisms.\r\n    Epidemics I. and III.\r\n    On the Articulations.\r\n    On Fractures.\r\n    On the Instruments of Reduction.\r\n    The Oath.\r\n\r\n3. That the following treatises may be pretty confidently acknowledged\r\nas genuine, although the evidence in their favor is not so strong as it\r\nis with regard to the preceding list:--\r\n\r\n    On Ancient Medicine.\r\n    On the Surgery.\r\n    The Law.\r\n    On Ulcers.\r\n    On Fistulæ.\r\n    On Hemorrhoids.\r\n    On the Sacred Disease.\r\n\r\n4. That as it certainly appears that the Book of Prognostics is\r\ncomposed, in a great measure, from the contents of the First\r\n“Prorrhetics” and the “Coacæ Prænotiones,” there can be little or\r\nno doubt that these two treatises are more ancient than the time of\r\nHippocrates.\r\n\r\n5. That although the exact time at which the Collection, as it now\r\nstands, was made out has never been determined in a very satisfactory\r\nmanner, an examination of the contents of the different treatises leads\r\nto the conclusion that most of them represent pretty faithfully the\r\nopinions held by the family of Hippocrates and his immediate successors\r\nin the Coan school of medicine.\r\n\r\n6. That a few of them, and more especially the two important works “On\r\nInternal Affections,” and “On Diseases,” would appear to bear distinct\r\ntraces of having emanated from the contemporary school of Cnidos.\r\n\r\n7. That although the Epistles and certain public documents usually\r\npublished at the end of the Collection may justly be suspected of being\r\nspurious, there is undoubted evidence that they are of very ancient\r\ndate, and were composed, most probably, within less than a hundred\r\nyears after the death of Hippocrates, so that there is every reason for\r\nbelieving that they relate to real events in the life of our author,\r\nand not to fictitious as some have supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION III.\r\n\r\n    ON THE PHYSICAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE ANCIENTS, AND MORE ESPECIALLY\r\n             THEIR DOCTRINES WITH REGARD TO THE ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is impossible to understand properly the medical theories which\r\noccur in the Hippocratic treatises without a competent acquaintance\r\nwith the Physical Philosophy of the ancients, I have thought it\r\nnecessary to devote an entire chapter to an exposition of the tenets\r\nheld by the philosophers regarding the elements of things. I might\r\nhave been able to dispense with this labor provided there had been any\r\nmodern publication to which I could refer the reader for the necessary\r\ninformation on the subject in question; but, unfortunately, there is no\r\nwork in the English language, as far as I am aware, in which the nature\r\nof the ancient doctrines is properly described. To give an example\r\nin point: Dr. Watson, the bishop of Llandaff, in his essay “On the\r\nTransmutability of Water into Earth,” makes the following remarks on\r\nthe ancient doctrine concerning the elements: “If but one particle of\r\nwater can, by any means, be changed into a particle of earth, the whole\r\ndoctrine of the Peripatetic sect concerning the elements of things\r\nwill be utterly subverted: the diversities of bodies subsisting in the\r\nuniverse will no longer be attributed to the different combinations of\r\nearth, air, fire, and water, _as distinct, immutable principles, but\r\nto the different magnitudes, figures, and arrangements of particles of\r\nmatter of the same kind_.”[278]\r\n\r\nNow it will at once be perceived by any person who is at all\r\nacquainted with modern science, that if the ancient dogmata be as here\r\nrepresented, they are altogether destitute of any solid foundation in\r\ntruth and nature, and we may well wonder that such a baseless structure\r\nshould have endured for so long a period. But before passing this\r\nsevere judgment on the tenets of our great forefathers in philosophy,\r\nit will be well to investigate their doctrines more accurately than Dr.\r\nWatson appears to have done in this instance.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the present investigation, I shall, in the first place,\r\ngive literal translations of extracts from the works of the most\r\ncelebrated sects of philosophers; namely, the Pythagoreans, Platonists,\r\nPeripatetics, Stoics, and Epicureans. It will, of course, be readily\r\nperceived, from what I have now stated, that I do not mean to confine\r\nmy inquiry to the period of ancient philosophy which preceded\r\nHippocrates, but that I am to bring it down to a pretty late age. This\r\ncourse I find it indispensably necessary to follow, as I could not\r\nderive sufficient illustration of the subject were I to restrict myself\r\nto the works of the earlier philosophers, who either preceded our\r\nauthor or were his contemporaries. I shall first give the extracts by\r\nthemselves, and then make some remarks in illustration of the doctrines\r\nwhich they expound. I think it proper to mention further, that I am\r\nanswerable for the correctness of the translations in all cases, unless\r\nwhere it is otherwise stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PYTHAGOREANS.\r\n\r\n“Fire being compressed produces air, and air water, and water earth:\r\nand from earth the same circuit of changes takes place till we come to\r\nfire.”[279]\r\n\r\n“In that part of the universe where Nature and Generation exert their\r\npowers, it is necessary that there should be these three things: In\r\nthe first place, that thing which being tangible furnishes a body to\r\neverything which comes into existence. This is the universal recipient\r\nand substance of impression for things generated, bearing the same\r\nrelation to things which are generated from them that water does to\r\njuice, and silence to sound, and darkness to light, and materials\r\nto the things fabricated from them. For water is void of taste and\r\nquality, bearing the same relation to sweet and bitter, and to sharp\r\nand salt. The air is unformed as to sound, or speech, or melody. And\r\ndarkness is devoid of color and shape, and bears the same relation\r\ntowards bright, and yellow, and white. But white bears reference also\r\nboth to the statuary art and that which forms figures of wax. But\r\nmatter admits of another comparison with the art of statuary. For\r\nall things exist in it _potentially_ before they are made, but\r\n_actually_ after they are made and have received their nature. In\r\norder, therefore, that there should be generation, it is necessary that\r\nthere should be some one substance as a substratum. In the second place\r\nthere are the _contraries_, in order that they may be changes and\r\ntransmutations, the primary matter undergoing passion and affection, in\r\norder that the qualities (_or_ powers, δυναμεις), being mutually\r\npassive, may not destroy, nor be destroyed, by one another. These (the\r\ncontraries) are, heat and cold, moisture and dryness. In the third\r\nplace are those substances in which these powers reside, namely, fire\r\nand water, air and earth. For these differ from the powers (qualities?)\r\nFor the substances are consumed in place by one another, but the powers\r\nare neither consumed nor formed, for they are the incorporeal reasons\r\nof these.[280] Of these four, heat and cold are causes, and active; but\r\ndryness and humidity are as the materials, and passive. In the first\r\nplace there is matter, the universal recipient, for it is the common\r\nsubject (_or_ substratum) of all things, so that it is the first\r\nsensible body in potentiality, and the original of all things: next are\r\nthe contraries, such as heat and cold, moisture and dryness; and in the\r\nthird place there are fire, water, earth, and air: _these all change\r\ninto one another_, but the contraries do not change.”[281]\r\n\r\nThe primary matter is afterwards defined to be “the subject body, that\r\nwhich receives all the changes, the universal recipient, and that which\r\npotentially is the first to the touch.”[282]\r\n\r\n“The first principles of all created things are the substratum, matter,\r\nand the reason of shape; namely, form. The bodies are their offspring,\r\nnamely, fire, air, earth, water.”[283]\r\n\r\n“Pythagoras taught that the original of all things is the monad, that\r\nfrom the monad sprung the duad, which is the subject matter to the\r\nefficient monad: that from the monad and infinite duad were formed the\r\nnumbers: from the numbers the points; from them the lines, from these\r\nfigures of superficies; from the superficies the solid figures; from\r\nthese the solid bodies, of which are the elements, fire, water, earth,\r\nair:--_that from these, changed and converted into every shape_,\r\nis formed the world, which is animated, intelligent, of a spherical\r\nshape, comprehending in its middle the earth, which also is spherical\r\nand inhabited all round.[284]\r\n\r\n“Pythagoras said, that none of the elements is pure, for that earth\r\ncontains fire, and fire air, and water air, etc.”[285]\r\n\r\n    “Nor those which elements we call abide,\r\n    Nor to this figure, nor to that are ty’d:\r\n    For this eternal world is said of old\r\n    But four prolific principles to hold,\r\n    Four different bodies: two to heaven ascend,\r\n    And other two down to the centre tend:\r\n    Fire first with wings expanded mounts on high,\r\n    Pure, void of weight, and dwells in upper sky:\r\n    Then air, because unclogged, in empty space\r\n    Flies after fire, and claims the second place;\r\n    But weighty water, as her nature guides,\r\n    Lies on the lap of earth; and mother Earth subsides.\r\n    All things are mixed of these, which all contain,\r\n    And into these are all resolved again:\r\n    Earth rarefies to dew; expanding more\r\n    The subtile dew in air begins to soar:\r\n    Spreads as she flies and weary of the name,\r\n    Extenuates still and changes into flame.\r\n    Thus having by degrees perfection won,\r\n    Restless they soon untwist the web they spun.\r\n    And fire begins to lose her radiant hue,\r\n    Mix’d with gross air, and air descends in dew:\r\n    _And dew condensing does her form forego\r\n    And sinks a heavy lump of earth below_,\r\n    Thus are their figures never at a stand,\r\n    But changed by Nature’s innovating hand.”[286]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PLATONISTS.\r\n\r\n“Let us therefore say that the mother, _or_ receptacle of every\r\nvisible, nay of every sensible production, is neither earth, nor air,\r\nnor fire, nor water, nor any of the things which arise out of these,\r\nnor out of which these arise, but a certain invisible and formless\r\nbeing, the universal recipient, concerning which being, if we say that\r\nit is in a very dubious way intelligible, and something most hard to be\r\napprehended, we shall not speak false.”[287]\r\n\r\nThe primary matter “admits of everything, but partakes of no shape\r\nnor resemblance to anything which enters into it. It is the substance\r\nof impression[288] to everything in nature, being moved and altered\r\nby those things which enter into it (_the forms_?), and by their\r\nmeans it appears sometimes one thing and sometimes another.”[289]\r\n\r\n“In the first place, we see that which we call water, being\r\ncompressed, become stones and earth. But being dissolved and expanded,\r\nit becomes breath and air. Air, by combustion, is converted into fire,\r\nwhich, being compressed and extinguished, assumes its original form.\r\nFire and air meeting together, and being condensed, become cloud and\r\nvapor; and from the condensation of these, running water is formed.\r\n_And from water again, earth and stones are formed._”[290]\r\n\r\nPlato taught “that God, matter, and form, are the originals of all\r\nthings:--that matter is increate and incorruptible, neither fire, nor\r\nwater, nor any of the principles nor elements, but a substance capable\r\nof form and subject to fabrication: that when rude and deprived of\r\nevery quality of configuration, God, the artificer, formed the universe\r\nfrom it. He taught, that matter is the original of all bodies, that it\r\nwas stamped with the impression of forms, and hence were produced the\r\nelements, namely, fire, water, earth, and air.”[291]\r\n\r\n“Earth contains water, and water, as some suppose, carries earth: air\r\nis formed from water, and from dense air fire is formed.”[292]\r\n\r\n“There being four kinds of bodies, by the mutual changes of them\r\nthe nature of the world is preserved. _For water is formed from\r\nearth_, and air from water, and ether from air: and then inversely,\r\nfrom ether, air; from air, water; and from water, earth, which is\r\nlowest in the scale.”[293]\r\n\r\n“Those who have investigated matter, if they have formed any right\r\nconception of it, have agreed in considering it as the subject and\r\nreceptacle of forms.”[294]\r\n\r\n“Concerning the receptacle of bodies this may be said. In the first\r\nplace, that there must be a certain substratum to bodies different from\r\nthemselves, _is demonstrated by the transmutation of the elements\r\ninto one another_. For that which is changed is not altogether\r\nconsumed, or, if it is, a substance is changed into a non-entity. And\r\nneither has that which is born come into existence from nothing, but\r\nit has undergone a change from one form into another. For something\r\nremains which has received the new form and cast off the other. And\r\nthis is shown by destruction, for it applies only to a compound body;\r\nand, if this be true, every such body is compounded of matter and\r\nform. Induction bears testimony to the truth of this, by showing, that\r\nwhatever is dissolved was compounded; and analysis in the same manner,\r\nas, for example, if a phial be resolved into gold, and gold into water;\r\nand water, in like manner, when it perishes, requires to be something\r\nanalogous. But the elements must be either form, or primary matter, or\r\na compound of form and matter. But they cannot be form, for without\r\nmatter, how could they be possessed of bulk and magnitude? But they\r\nare not primary matter, for it is not consumed. It follows, then, that\r\nthey must consist of form and the primary matter. But form regards\r\nquality and shape, but it (the primary matter) pertains to the subject\r\nwhich is indeterminate, (ἀόριστον _or_ ἀόρατον) because it is not\r\nform.”[295]\r\n\r\n“Matter of itself is devoid of form, matter is the subject of all\r\nthings.”[296]\r\n\r\n“The followers of Plato and Aristotle are of opinion, that there is\r\na difference between the first principles and the elements. For, the\r\nelements are compounded, but the first principles are not compounded\r\nnor formed from any thing. What we call the elements are fire, air,\r\nearth, and water; but we call that a principle which has nothing\r\nfrom which it is formed, since otherwise it is not a principle, but\r\nthat from which it is formed. But there is something antecedent to\r\nwater and earth, from which they are formed; namely, the first matter\r\nwhich is devoid of shape and form; then there is form (which we call\r\n_entelocheia_) and privation.”[297]\r\n\r\n“Plato, wishing to prove that the elements have one common matter as a\r\nsubstratum to all, in his ‘Timæus,’ enters into a discussion regarding\r\ntheir transmutation into one another. But he being well acquainted with\r\nthe art of demonstration, has treated properly of the change of the\r\nfirst bodies into one another. But Thales, Anaximenes, Anaximander,\r\nand Heraclitus, assuming each that there is some one element, endeavor\r\nto prove this from their changing into one another. Yet all these\r\nseem to me to have had an obscure idea (ὀνειράττειν) of some matter,\r\nwhich is a common substratum to all the elements, and seeing that it\r\nis single they supposed that there is but one element. But instead of\r\nsaying that this is a common element from which the others, I mean air,\r\nfire, water, and earth, are formed, they passed it over altogether and\r\nendeavored to demonstrate the same thing of some one of the elements,\r\nall proceeding upon the same mode of demonstration, although they did\r\nnot all make choice of the same element.”[298]\r\n\r\n“With regard to the old philosophers, called physical, it will be\r\nobvious to us when we read their writings on Nature, that they held the\r\nexistence of a first matter which is increate and eternal, being the\r\nsubstratum to all created and perceptible things.”[299]\r\n\r\n“That the elements change into one another is admitted, even by the\r\nfollowers of Thales, it being so apparent. Hence it is inferred that\r\nthe elements have one common matter for a substratum.”[300]\r\n\r\nPhilo, the platonic Jew of Alexandria, in his treatise “On the\r\nCreation of the World,” thus expresses his opinions regarding the\r\noriginal state of matter. “Whoever would wish to discover the cause\r\nwhy this universe was framed, would not be far from the truth, in my\r\nopinion, if he said with one of the ancients, that the Father and Maker\r\nof it is good, and for that reason he spared not to impart of his most\r\nexcellent nature to a substance having nothing beautiful in itself, but\r\npossessing the capacity of becoming all things. Of itself it was devoid\r\nof form, quality, and life; and was full of contrariety, confusion, and\r\ndissonance.”\r\n\r\n“Moses, the chief of philosophers, and instructed in many of the most\r\ncomprehensive secrets of Nature by oracles, was aware that it was\r\nmost necessary that there should be in the universe an active cause\r\nand a passive subject. That the active is the most pure and perfect\r\nsoul of the universe, more excellent than virtue, more excellent than\r\nknowledge, more excellent than even goodness and beauty. That the\r\npassive is of itself without life and motion, but being moved and\r\nfigured, and enlivened by mind, it was changed into a most perfect\r\nwork.”[301]\r\n\r\nHis opinion regarding the elements may be collected from the following\r\npassages:--“Fire being extinguished is converted into thick air, and\r\nair being compressed subsides into water, and water being still more\r\ncompressed is changed into earth, the densest of the elements.”[302]\r\n\r\n“Nothing that is pure can be comprehended by the senses.”[303]\r\n\r\n“The elements are inanimate matter, of itself devoid of motion, and\r\nsubjected to the artificer, by whom it is transformed into all kinds of\r\nshapes and qualities.”[304]\r\n\r\nI shall venture to give under this head the opinions of one of the\r\nArabian medical authors.\r\n\r\n“It is to be kept in mind that the elements which are perceived by the\r\nsenses, namely, fire, air, earth, and water, are by no means the pure\r\nelements, but such as are comprehended by the mind. These are not to be\r\nperceived by the senses. None of the others is pure, nor without some\r\nadmixture.”[305]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PERIPATETICS.\r\n\r\nAristotle defines the first matter as follows: “I call matter the first\r\nsubject of everything, all things being formed from it existing in them\r\nnot accidentally; and when anything is destroyed, it comes to this at\r\nlast.”[306]\r\n\r\nIn his Logical work he thus defines his ideas regarding the first\r\nsubstances, namely, mind and matter. “The first substances being\r\nthe subjects of all other things, and as every other thing may\r\nbe predicated by them and exists in them, are called the prime\r\nsubstances.[307] “We must distinguish the first bodies from matter,\r\nfor we must suppose concerning them that they have a first principle\r\nand origin, namely, matter, which is inseparable from them, and is the\r\nsubject of the contraries. For heat does not furnish the materials to\r\ncold, nor it to heat, but the subject to both. So that we have first\r\nthe sensible body in potentiality, the first principle; then we have\r\nthe contraries, I mean cold and heat; and thirdly, fire and water, and\r\nthe like. These change into one another, and not as Empedocles and\r\nothers say of them.[308]\r\n\r\n“The _material_ of all bodies, great and small, is the same.\r\nThis is apparent; for when air is formed from water, the same matter,\r\nwhen it becomes another thing, acquires nothing new, only that which\r\nformerly existed in capacity now exists actually.”[309]\r\n\r\nThe following extracts will show the opinions of his most celebrated\r\ncommentators:\r\n\r\n“Air and fire have one common character, namely, heat; therefore they\r\nreadily change into one another. Air and water readily change into\r\none another, for they have a common character, namely, moisture. In\r\nlike manner, water and earth, for they have an alliance, namely,\r\ncoldness.”[310]\r\n\r\n“The physical philosophers analyze any substance, as, for example,\r\na man into head, hands, and feet; and these into bones, flesh, and\r\nnerves; and these into the four elements; and these again into matter\r\nand form.”[311]\r\n\r\n“Water is formed from air, and air from water, and fire from air,\r\nbecause they all have one common substratum, matter.”[312]\r\n\r\nThe next two extracts will show the opinions entertained by Aristotle’s\r\nsuccessor in the Peripatetic school of philosophy.\r\n\r\n“Of the simple substances, fire has peculiar powers. _For air, water,\r\nand earth, admit only of changes into one another_, but none of them\r\ncan produce itself.”[313]\r\n\r\n“The nature of those substances called simple is mixed, and existing in\r\none another.”[314]\r\n\r\n“The Peripatetics divided Nature into two things, the one of which is\r\nefficient, and the other that which furnishes it with the materials\r\nfrom which anything is made. Power exists in the one, and matter is the\r\nessence of the other.”[315]\r\n\r\n“The first principles are air, fire, water, and earth, for from them\r\nare formed all living things and the productions of the earth: they are\r\ntherefore called elements; of these, air and fire have the power of\r\nmoving and forming the others (I mean water and earth), of receiving\r\nor suffering. Besides these, Aristotle thought that there is a fifth\r\nelement, from which the stars and the souls of individuals are made;\r\nbut that all these had for a substratum a certain matter devoid of\r\nform and quality, from which all things are framed, a substance which\r\nhas a capacity for all things, and admits of all changes, that when it\r\nperishes it is not reduced to nothing, but into its parts, which can be\r\ncut and divided infinitely, since there is nothing in Nature that is\r\nnot divisible.”[316]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STOICS.\r\n\r\n“They are of opinion that the first principles of all things are\r\ntwo--the active and the passive: that the passive is matter, a\r\nbeing devoid of all qualities; the active, or efficient, is the\r\nreason (λόγος) residing in it, that is, God. That he, being eternal,\r\nfabricates all things from it all (all matter?). That there is a\r\ndifference between the first principles and the elements--that the\r\nformer are increate and indestructible, whilst the elements are\r\ndestructible by burning (ἐκπύρωσιν).--That the first principles are\r\nbodies devoid of form, whereas the elements are possessed of form.\r\nThat God and Mind, Fate and Jupiter, are one and the same being under\r\ndifferent appellations; that he formed the four elements, fire, air,\r\nwater, earth.”[317]\r\n\r\n“Our Stoics say, that there are two principles in Nature from which\r\nall things are formed, namely, cause and matter. That matter lies\r\ninert, a being prepared for all things, but inactive, unless some one\r\nmove it.--That cause, that is, reason, forms matter, and changes it at\r\nwill. There must be something _by_ which everything is made and\r\n_of_ which it is made: the former is the cause, the latter the\r\nmatter.”[318]\r\n\r\n“Some of our sect are of opinion that air, being changeable into fire\r\nand water, etc.”[319]\r\n\r\n“We are of opinion that earth is changeable. To this we may add that\r\nall things are formed from all things--air from water--water from\r\nair--fire from air--air from fire; _why, then, should not earth be\r\nformed from water, and water from earth?_ Earth is formed from\r\nwater--why then not water from earth?”[320]\r\n\r\n“The Stoics divided Nature into two things, the one of which is the\r\nefficient, and the other that which furnishes itself as the materials\r\nfrom which anything is made.”[321]\r\n\r\nSuidas says, regarding the first principles: “The first principles of\r\nall things are two, the efficient and the passive. The passive, then,\r\nis a being devoid of qualities--earth, matter. The efficient is the\r\nreason residing in it, namely, God. The principles and elements are\r\ndifferent, inasmuch as the former are increate and indestructible,\r\nwhile the elements are destructible by burning. Besides, the first\r\nprinciples are without body and form, but the elements have form.”[322]\r\n\r\n“Zeno, the son of Mnaseas, the Citiensian, taught that there are two\r\nprinciples, God and matter, the one efficient and the other passive;\r\nand that there are four elements.”[323]\r\n\r\n“The Stoics maintain that the first principles are two, God and matter;\r\nnot that they consider God as an element, but as the active principle,\r\nwhilst matter is the passive.”[324]\r\n\r\n“Always remember the saying of Heraclitus, _that the dissolution of\r\nearth is to become water, and the dissolution of water to become earth;\r\nand the dissolution of air to become fire, and conversely_.”[325]\r\n\r\n“Contemplate the courses of the stars as if carried about with them,\r\nand frequently revolve in your mind the mutual transmutations of the\r\nelements into one another.”[326]\r\n\r\n“Acquire the habit of contemplating the transmutation of all things\r\ninto one another.”[327]\r\n\r\n“Fire, air, water, earth, were so formed by Nature as to furnish\r\naliment by turns to one another.”[328]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE EPICUREANS.\r\n\r\n    “Therefore all those who teach things took their birth\r\n    From simple fire, or water, air, or earth,\r\n    Lie under palpable mistakes. And those\r\n    That teach from doubled elements they rose,\r\n    As air and fire, as earth and water joined,\r\n    Or all four, earth, air, water, fire combined:\r\n    Thus sung Empedocles.\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    If all things from four elements arose,\r\n    And are again by death dissolved to those:\r\n    What reason we should rather fondly deem\r\n    Them principles of things, than things from them?\r\n    _For they alternately are changed and show\r\n    Each other’s figure and their nature too._”[329]\r\n\r\nThe following passage will show the opinions of Democritus, the\r\ncontemporary and friend of Hippocrates, from whom Epicurus took his\r\nsystem of physics.[330] “He taught that the atoms are infinite in\r\nmagnitude and number, that they revolve in all space, and that thus\r\nthey formed _the compound bodies fire, water, air, earth_; for\r\nthat even these are composed from the atoms, which are impassive and\r\nunchangeable owing to their hardness.”[331]\r\n\r\nThese extracts prove clearly that the great philosophers of\r\nantiquity stand acquitted of having held the erroneous opinions\r\ngenerally ascribed to them respecting the elements of things, and\r\nthat nothing can be farther from the truth than the account of the\r\nPeripatetic doctrines given by Dr. Watson. Instead of maintaining,\r\nas he carelessly represents, that “earth, air, fire, and water are\r\ndistinct, uncompounded, immutable principles;” they taught, on the\r\ncontrary, as we have shown, that all the elements are modifications\r\nof one common substance called the primary matter, and consequently\r\nthey held, like himself, that “the elements are different magnitudes,\r\nfigures, and arrangements of particles of matter of the same kind.”\r\nThis primary matter they demonstrated to be devoid of all quality and\r\nform, but susceptible of all forms and qualities.[332] In the language\r\nof the Peripatetics, it is everything in capacity, but nothing in\r\nactuality. They held that there are two original principles, both\r\nincreate and indestructible; the one matter, the universal passive\r\nprinciple[333]--the material _from_ which all things are formed;\r\nand the other, the efficient cause _by_ which all things are\r\nmade:--that the one is possessed of universal privation, and the other\r\nof universal energy:--that it is the one which _impresses_,\r\nand the other which _receives_ the forms of all things. They\r\nmaintained that the original materials out of which all objects in the\r\nuniverse are composed being the same, bodies owe their characteristic\r\nqualities not to their substance, but to their form. The elements,\r\nthen, according to the notions of the ancient philosophers, are\r\nthe first matter arranged into certain distinguishing forms by the\r\nefficient cause. That form with which solidity is associated they\r\ncall earth, under which they ranged all metals, stones, and the like,\r\nfor all these they held to be allied to one another in nature, as\r\nwell as in the form under which they are presented to our senses.\r\nThe next arrangement of created substances is that which constitutes\r\nfluidity, and is called water, under which term they comprehended not\r\nonly the native element, but every other modification of matter which\r\nassumes a similar form, namely, all juices of vegetables and fluids\r\nof animals.[334] Some of their earliest speculators in philosophy\r\nmaintained that all the materials which compose the universe existed\r\nat one time in this form; and it is curious to reflect that modern\r\ngeology has reproduced nearly the same doctrine. The third form of\r\nmatter, as presented to our sense of touch, is air, under which the\r\nancient philosophers comprehended all matter in an aërial state, such\r\nas water converted into vapor, and what are now called gases. Whether\r\nor not they believed the atmosphere which surrounds this earth to be\r\na homogeneous substance, in nowise affects the general principles of\r\ntheir philosophy; for it is the same thing, as far as regards their\r\nclassification, whether they held that the atmosphere consists of one\r\nor of several distinct combinations of the primary matter with form.\r\nAs they were well aware that several distinct modifications of matter\r\nare comprehended under each of the other elements, it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that they inferred the like of air; and, indeed, it is quite\r\napparent from the works of Galen that he knew very well that some\r\nkinds of air are favorable, and others unfavorable to respiration and\r\ncombustion.[335] But those phenomena which we ascribe to oxygen gas,\r\nthey, without doubt, would have attributed to the operations of some\r\nmodification of the element fire. By fire, they meant matter in its\r\nextreme state of tenuity and refinement. Of this elementary principle,\r\nPlato[336] and Theophrastus[337] have enumerated many varieties,\r\nand have speculated regarding their nature with great precision and\r\nacuteness. The ancient philosophers believed that fire is universally\r\ndiffused through the universe, being sometimes in a _sensible_,\r\nand sometimes in a _latent_ state; or, as Aristotle expressed it,\r\nheat exists sometimes in capacity, and sometimes in energy.[338] They\r\nattributed the phenomena of lightning to an unequal distribution of\r\nthis elemental fire.[339] This is the element with which they supposed\r\nlife to be most intimately connected; and, indeed, some of them would\r\nappear to have considered fire as the very essence of the soul. “I\r\nam of opinion,” says the author of one of the Hippocratic treatises,\r\n“that what we call heat is immortal, and understands, sees, and hears\r\nall things that are or will be.”[340] This doctrine, which, to say the\r\nleast of it, is not very judiciously expressed in this passage, is thus\r\ncorrected by the great master of logic and philosophy: “Some,” says\r\nAristotle, “improperly call fire or some such power the soul; but it\r\nwould be better to say that the soul subsists in such a body, because\r\nheat is, of all bodies, the one most obedient to the operations of the\r\nsoul; for to nourish and move are the operations of the soul, and these\r\nshe performs by the instrumentality of this power (_or_ quality?).\r\nTo say that the soul is fire, is as if one were to call a saw or a\r\nwimble the artisan or his art, because his work is accomplished in\r\nco-operation with these instruments. From this it appears why animals\r\nstand in need of heat.”[341] And in like manner he says, in another of\r\nhis works: “Some are of opinion that the nature of fire is plainly the\r\ncause of nourishment and of growth; for it appears to be the only body\r\nor element which nourishes and increases itself. Wherefore one might\r\nsuppose that it is this that operates both in plants and in animals.\r\nYet it is but the co-cause (συνάιτιον); for _it_ is not, properly\r\nspeaking, the cause, but rather the soul. For the increase of fire is\r\nindeterminate in so far as it is supplied with fuel. But of natural\r\nsubstances there is a certain limit and reason (λόγος) of magnitude and\r\nincrease. This belongs to the soul rather than to fire, to the reason\r\nrather than to the matter.”[342]\r\n\r\nFrom these observations, coupled with the information supplied in\r\nthe preceding extracts, it will be perceived that, although there be,\r\nat first sight, a great discrepancy among physical doctrines of the\r\nancient philosophers, they differed, in fact, much less than they\r\nwould appear to do, only that some of them expressed themselves more\r\nscientifically than others in handling the subject of the elements.\r\nThus, although Thales seems to hold _water_, and Anaximander\r\n_air_, and Heraclitus _fire_, to be original principles, we\r\nhave every reason to believe that, as Galen says (l. c.), even they had\r\nan idea that these are not simple substances, but merely modifications\r\nof one unformed principle, the first matter, from which they conceived\r\nthat all bodies in the universe are constructed. Contrary, then, to\r\nwhat is very generally supposed, it would appear that there was at\r\nbottom no very great difference of opinion between the philosophers\r\nof the Ionic school and those of the other sects, namely, the\r\nPythagoreans, Platonists, Peripatetics, Stoics, and Epicureans; and\r\nfurther, that, from the earliest dawn of philosophy, down to the time\r\nwhen it fell into neglect and came to be misunderstood, the physical\r\ndoctrines of the philosophers underwent but little variation.\r\n\r\nFrom the elements, then, constructed in the manner now explained, out\r\nof the primary matter, the ancient philosophers taught that all the\r\nsecondary bodies in the universe are formed, and as they maintained the\r\ntransmutability of the elements into one another, so, in like manner,\r\nthey did not hesitate to proclaim it as a great general truth “that all\r\nthings are convertible into all things.”[343] The possibility, then,\r\nof such permutations will not, I presume, be questioned by any one who\r\nhas formed correct ideas of the powers of the Great First Cause, and\r\nthe capacities of the first subject, Matter, and that such permutations\r\ndo actually take place in the course of Nature may be inferred from\r\nmany phenomena of daily occurrence in the vegetable and animal world.\r\nIt cannot have escaped the most careless observation what changes the\r\ngreat pabulum, water, undergoes in the process of vegetation--how it\r\nis converted into various woods, and barks, and leaves, and flowers,\r\nall of which are resolvable, by the process of decay, into air, or\r\nreducible into earth. It is also well known that, although a more\r\nunfrequent occurrence, all the solid parts of a tree may undergo a\r\nmutation into rock, that is to say, may become petrified. But it is in\r\nthe higher classes of animals that these changes of simple matter admit\r\nof the greatest variety. Let us contemplate for a moment some of the\r\nmost remarkable mutations which any article of food (as, for example,\r\nflour-bread), which has been presented to the stomach, is destined\r\nto undergo in the animal frame. We know that the vital powers of the\r\nstomach will convert the starch, of which it principally consists, into\r\na fluid state, that is to say, into what is called first chyme, and\r\nafterwards, when it has undergone some further change, is denominated\r\nchyle by the physiologists. Having been thus changed, it passes, by a\r\nprocess about the nature of which physiologists are still strangely\r\ndivided in opinion, into certain vessels; and then, in some manner\r\nstill less understood, it is converted into a fluid _sui generis_,\r\ncalled blood, abounding in globules of a singular construction, all\r\nfabricated, no doubt, from the food, but, by some occult process,\r\nwhich has hitherto defied the skillful manipulation of the chemist,\r\nand the accurate observation of the microscopist, to explain in any\r\nsatisfactory manner.[344] And so complete is the transformation that\r\nscarcely one particle of the original food can be detected in the\r\nnew product by all the vaunted tests of modern science. But blood is\r\nsoon after converted into many other fluid and solid substances--into\r\nbones, cartilages, muscles, and vessels, and into bile, mucus, and\r\nother recrementitious matters, all differing greatly from one another,\r\nboth in their appearances and in their properties.[345] And when all\r\nthe component parts of the animal frame are constructed, and each\r\nseems to have acquired a determinate structure, should the vital\r\nactions by which they are formed become deranged, we may see the\r\nfair fabric undergo the most wonderful mutations, so that arteries\r\nare converted into bones, and bones into flesh and jelly.[346] So\r\nmany and so extraordinary are the changes which a simple alimentary\r\nsubstance may undergo in the animal frame! And if we admit, with the\r\nancient philosophers, that every such substance is resolvable into one\r\nor more of the elements, and that all the elements are but different\r\nmodifications of one common matter, how wonderful a thing must Form be,\r\nsince it imparts such varied appearances and qualities to one common\r\nsubstratum?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn detailing these opinions of the ancient philosophers, it is not my\r\npresent business to determine whether they be true or not; my task is\r\nfulfilled, if I have given a distinct and faithful exposition of them,\r\nso that their real import and meaning may be readily comprehended by\r\nthe medical reader. I may be allowed to remark, however, that, strange\r\nalthough that Protean being, the primary matter, may appear to be to\r\nsuch men of science as are not disposed to recognize the existence of\r\nany substance which cannot be subjected to their senses, and who refuse\r\nto admit the legitimacy of every process of analysis, but what is\r\nconducted in the laboratory of the chemist, opinions similar to those\r\nof the ancient philosophers have been held by some of the most profound\r\nthinkers and distinguished experimentalists of modern times. Thus Lord\r\nBacon, the reputed father of the inductive philosophy, appears to admit\r\nall the tenets of the ancients regarding the first matter, which,\r\nlike them, he considers to have been embodied in the Homeric fable of\r\nProteus.[347] He says, in reference to it, “that under the person of\r\nProteus is signified _Matter_, the most ancient of all things,\r\nnext to the Deity; that the herd of Proteus was nothing else than the\r\nordinary species of animals, plants, and metals, into which matter\r\nappears to diffuse, and, as it were, to consume itself; so that, after\r\nit has formed and finished those several species, (its task being,\r\nin a manner, complete,) it appears to sleep and be at rest, nor to\r\nlabor at, attempt, or prepare any species farther.”[348] That learned\r\nand accomplished scholar, Mr. Harris, in his work on “Philosophical\r\nArrangements,” writes thus on the subject we are now treating of:\r\n“Here, then, we have an idea (such as it is) of that singular being,\r\nthe Primary Matter, a Being which those philosophers who are immerged\r\nin sensible subjects know not well how to admit, though they cannot\r\nwell do without it; a Being which flies the perception of every sense,\r\nand which is at best, even to the intellect, but a negative object, no\r\notherwise comprehensible than either by analogy or abstraction.\r\n\r\n“We gain a glimpse of it by abstraction, when we say that the first\r\nmatter is not the lineaments and complexion which make the beautiful\r\nface; nor yet the flesh and blood which make these lineaments and that\r\ncomplexion; nor yet the liquid and solid aliments, which make that\r\nflesh and blood; nor yet the simple bodies of earth and water, which\r\nmake those various aliments; but something which, being below all\r\nthese, and supporting them all, is yet different from them all, and\r\nessential to their existence.\r\n\r\n“We obtain a sight of it by analogy when we say that, as is the brass\r\nto the statue, the marble to the pillar, the timber to the ship, or\r\nany one secondary matter to any secondary form; so is the First and\r\nOriginal Matter to all forms in general.”[349]\r\n\r\nNay, the illustrious Sir Isaac Newton would seem, in the following\r\nextract, to countenance the profound speculations of the ancient\r\nphilosophers with respect to the elements, and the transmutations of\r\nthese substances into one another. He says, “Are not gross bodies and\r\nlight (_or_ ether) convertible into one another?--and may not\r\nbodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light\r\nwhich enter into their composition? The changing of bodies into light\r\nand of light into bodies is very agreeable to the course of Nature,\r\nwhich seems delighted with permutations. Water, which is a very fluid\r\ntasteless salt, she changes by heat into vapor, a sort of air; and\r\nby cold into ice, which is a hard, pellucid, brittle, fusible stone,\r\nand this stone returns into water by heat, and vapor returns into\r\nwater by cold. Earth, by heat, becomes fire, and by cold returns into\r\nearth.”[350]\r\n\r\nI may further mention that all the late researches of chemical\r\nphilosophers have tended to confirm the tenets of the ancients\r\nregarding the Elements. Thus in that very singular performance “The\r\nElements of Physiophilosophy,” by Dr. Lorenz Oken, the productions of\r\nthe mineral kingdom are classified, very much in accordance with the\r\nancient arrangement, into four classes, namely, into Earth-earths,\r\nWater-earths, Air-earths, and Fire-earths.[351] It is also well\r\nknown that chemical experiment has lately established that several\r\nanimal and vegetable substances, such as albumen, fibrin, and casein,\r\nwhich were formerly looked upon as distinct substances, are all but\r\nmodifications of one substance, which is now regarded as the original\r\nof all the tissues; and further, that protein, in every respect\r\nidentical with that which forms the basis of the three aforesaid animal\r\nprinciples, may be obtained from similar elements in the vegetable\r\nkingdom.[352] And if every step which we advance in the knowledge\r\nof the intimate structure of things leads us to contract the number\r\nof substances formerly held to be simple, I would not wonder if it\r\nshould yet turn out that oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen are,\r\nlike what the ancients held the elements to be--all nothing else but\r\ndifferent modifications of one ever-changing matter. But I will not\r\nindulge further in such speculations, especially as I have reason to\r\napprehend that I may be thought to be wandering from my own proper\r\nsphere in thus prosecuting researches which may be supposed to have\r\nbut a distant bearing on the subject now in hand. I must, however,\r\nbe allowed again to repeat my declaration that it is impossible to\r\ncomprehend the theories contained in the Hippocratic treatises without\r\na proper acquaintance with the Physical Philosophy of the ancients,\r\nand that these principles have been misapprehended and misrepresented\r\nmost unaccountably by modern writers, so as to occasion corresponding\r\nmistakes with regard to ancient medicine. I trust, then, that my\r\npresent labors will not be ineffectual in preventing such mistakes\r\nin future; though, at the same time, knowing, as I well do, the\r\npractical bent of British science at the present day, I cannot but be\r\napprehensive that a certain portion of my readers will lend a deaf ear\r\nto speculative opinions, of which they cannot recognize the importance,\r\nand will be disposed to discard the doctrines of the ancient\r\nphilosophers, before they have rightly comprehended their import:\r\n\r\n    “Nec mea dona tibi studio comporta fideli\r\n    Intellecta prius quam sint, contempta relinquas.”[353]\r\n\r\nI am sensible, too, that I may have just reason to suspect that I\r\nstill retain a too partial fondness for the fascinating studies in\r\nwhich I indulged at one period, beyond what, perhaps, was prudent in\r\na physician, and that it would have been better for me if I had taken\r\na lesson from the mythical hero of the “Odyssey,” and had resisted\r\nthe enchanting voice of the ancient Siren when she sought to allure\r\nme from the active duties of a professional life, with the confident\r\nassurance that I should leave her “much delighted, and with an increase\r\nof knowledge.”[354]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I will briefly recapitulate the results to which our\r\npresent inquiry has conducted us:--\r\n\r\n1st. That many of the medical theories which occur in the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises are founded on the physical philosophy of the ancients, and\r\nmore particularly on their doctrines, with regard to the elements of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n2d. That all the great sects of the ancient philosophers held that the\r\nfour elements, namely, fire, air, earth, and water, are transmutable\r\ninto one another, being all of a homogeneous nature, and based on one\r\ncommon substratum, namely, the primary matter.\r\n\r\n3d. That, by reasoning from observation and analogy, the ancient\r\nphilosophers arrived at the conclusion that this primary matter is a\r\nsubstance devoid of all qualities and forms, but susceptible of all\r\nforms and qualities.\r\n\r\n4th. That although certain of the philosophers, the contemporaries\r\nand predecessors of Hippocrates, appear to hold that some one of the\r\nelements, such as fire and water, was the original of all things, even\r\nthese had an idea, although not expressed by them in a definite manner,\r\nof a first matter, which serves as a basis to all the elements.\r\n\r\n5th. That these doctrines of the ancient philosophers, whether well\r\nfounded or not, are countenanced by many eminent names in modern\r\nliterature and philosophy.\r\n\r\n6th. That the opinion generally entertained regarding the doctrines\r\nof the ancient philosophers on this subject is altogether erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE WORKS OF HIPPOCRATES.\r\n\r\n                         ON ANCIENT MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as stated in the second section of the Preliminary\r\nDiscourse, the evidence in support of this treatise be unfortunately\r\nnot such as clearly to establish its genuineness, all who read it\r\nwith attention must admit that it is replete with important matters,\r\nand that if not the production of Hippocrates, it is not unworthy of\r\nhis high reputation. Notwithstanding, then, that I am by no means\r\nso well convinced as M. Littré is, that the work is genuine, I have\r\nnot hesitated to follow his example in placing it at the head of the\r\nlist, as the nature of its contents is such as to form an excellent\r\nintroduction to the study of the Hippocratic medicine.\r\n\r\nIt contains, as M. Littré remarks, a polemic, a method, and a system.\r\nThe polemic is directed against those of his predecessors who had\r\ncorrupted medicine by introducing hypotheses into it as the causes\r\nof disease, such as heat, cold, moisture, and dryness. These it will\r\nbe seen that he combats with great force of argument and clearness\r\nof illustration. The philosophical dogmas to which he is supposed to\r\nrefer in this place are those of the section of Pythagoreans, called\r\nthe Eleatic, who would appear to have held nearly the same opinions\r\nas Pythagoras himself with regard to the elements.[355] But, in\r\nfact, as I trust I have clearly made out in the third section of the\r\nPreliminary Discourse, all the ancient philosophers held substantially\r\nthe same opinion regarding the elements, although they did not all\r\nexpress themselves in the same terms. It is of little consequence,\r\nthen, to attempt to find out what particular class of philosophers our\r\nauthor directs his attack against, it being sufficient to say that\r\nhe decidedly condemns the practice of founding the rules of medical\r\npractice on hypothesis.[356] I may here remark, that the censure thus\r\nbestowed on hypothetical systems applies to modern times as well as to\r\nancient, to those who proclaim theories by which, like Broussais, they\r\naccount for all diseases upon figments which they call inflammations,\r\nand those who, like Cullen, attribute most diseases to spasms. We may\r\nrest assured, from the sensible observations which Hippocrates makes on\r\nthis subject in the present work, that the causes of all diseases are\r\nrealities, provided we could find them out, and that they are not vague\r\nabstractions, as the authors of these hypotheses suppose.\r\n\r\nHis method of cultivating medicine is founded on an attentive\r\nexamination of all the circumstances connected with real life, and his\r\nsystem consists in studying the condition of the humors in the body,\r\ntheir origin, their coction, and their disappearance.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature, however, in the contents of this little\r\ntreatise is the practical view which is here given of the origin of\r\nmedicine, namely, from the necessities and weaknesses of the human\r\nrace. The author clearly makes it out that Medicine is, as it were, a\r\ncorollary to Dietetics. Nothing of the kind can well be imagined more\r\ningenious and original than his observations and reasonings on this\r\nhead in the introductory sections to this treatise. See in particular §\r\n5.\r\n\r\nThe remarks in refutation of the hypothesis of cold, heat, moist, and\r\ndry, are very interesting. (§ 13.)\r\n\r\nThe reflections on the origin of fevers and inflammations are very just\r\nand original, but would appear not to have been properly appreciated by\r\nhis successors; for among all the ancient authors who have treated of\r\nfevers, there is, perhaps, no one but himself who has stated in decided\r\nterms that there is something more in a fever than a mere increase of\r\nthe innate (_or_ animal) heat. See the Commentary on PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, B. II., 1.\r\n\r\nThe remarks on the effects of the cold bath at § 16 are much to the\r\npurpose, and deserve attention.\r\n\r\nThe observations on rheums _or_ defluxions (§ 19) are also very\r\nstriking, and even at the present day, after the many vicissitudes of\r\nmedical theory which we have gone through, it would be difficult to\r\ndeny that the opinions here advanced are well founded. At all events\r\nthey must be allowed to be highly interesting, as containing the first\r\ngerm of a theory which long flourished in the schools of medicine.\r\n\r\nAt § 20 the author seems to hold that philosophy is not so necessary\r\nto medicine as medicine is to philosophy. Schulze, with a considerable\r\nshow of reason, argues that Celsus had this passage in view when he\r\npronounced, concerning Hippocrates, that he was the first person\r\nwho separated medicine from philosophy. (Hist. Med. I., 3, i., 26.)\r\nSchulze contends that what Celsus meant was, that Hippocrates discarded\r\n_à priori_ arguments in medicine, and drew all his inferences\r\nfrom actual observation. This would appear to me the most plausible\r\ninterpretation which has ever been given to this celebrated passage\r\nin the preface of Celsus. Philosophy, then, it would appear, freed\r\nmedicine from the delusions of superstition, by substituting the errors\r\nof hypothesis in their place, and the important office which he who was\r\ncalled the Father of Medicine conferred upon the art was by discarding\r\nboth superstition and hypothesis, and substituting the results of\r\nactual observation in the room of both.\r\n\r\nFrom § 22 to the end of the work the author gives important\r\nobservations on the modifications which diseases undergo in connection\r\nwith the peculiar organization of the part in which they are situated.\r\nIt may well be doubted whether the remarks and reflections herein\r\ncontained have ever obtained all the attention which they merit.\r\n\r\nThe style of this piece is certainly elegant and beautiful; and it is\r\nproper to mention that the text is remarkably improved in M. Littré’s\r\nedition. In all the previous editions it was more corrupt than that of\r\nalmost any other of the Hippocratic treatises.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks of M. Littré on the present work appear to me so\r\njust, and are so elegantly expressed, that I cannot deny myself the\r\npleasure of introducing them here in the original:\r\n\r\n“En résumé, le livre de _l’Ancienne Médecine_ donne une idée\r\ndes problèmes agités du temps d’Hippocrate, et de la manière donts\r\nils étaient débattus. Il s’agissait, dans la plus grande généralité\r\nde la pathologie de déterminer la cause des maladies ou, en d’autres\r\ntermes, de poser les bases d’un système de médecine. Certains médecins\r\ndisaient que cette cause, étant une, résidait dans une propriété unique\r\ndu corps, propriété qu’ils spécifiaient. Hippocrate répétait qu’en\r\nfait, cela était en contradiction avec l’expérience, qu’en principe\r\nune hypothèse était suspecte et stérile, et qu’il n’y avait de sureté\r\nque dans l’études des faits et dans la tradition de la science qui y\r\nramene. Ainsi, quatre cents ans avant J. C., on essayait de rattacher\r\ntoute la médecine à une seule propriété hypothétique, comme on l’a\r\nessayé de nos jours; mais cette propriété était ou le chaud, ou le\r\nfroid, ou l’humide, ou le sec. Quatre cents ans avant J. C., un esprit\r\nsévère et éclairé combattait de telles opinions au nom de l’expérience,\r\nmontrait que les causes des maladies ne pouvant pas se ramener à\r\nune seule, le champ de la pathologie générale était bien plus vaste\r\nqu’on ne croyait; et formulait ce que l’observation lui avait permis\r\nde conclure; mais sa conclusion n’embrasse guère que la trouble dans\r\nle mélange des humeurs, que leur coction et leurs crises. Depuis\r\nlors, la méthode de ceux qu’Hippocrate avait combattus, et la méthode\r\nd’Hippocrate, l’hypothèse et l’observation se sont perpétuées, ainsi\r\nque le témoigne l’histoire de la médecine, mais ce ne sont plus ni\r\nl’ancienne hypothèse, ni l’ancienne observation.\r\n\r\n“Il est certainement instructif d’étudier, dans le cours du temps, les\r\nproblèmes tels qu’ils ont été posés, et les discussions qu’ils ont\r\nsoulevées. On le voit, la science antique a de grandes ressemblances\r\navec la science moderne; dès l’époque que nous sommes forcés de\r\nregarder comme l’aurore de la médecine, dès les premiers monuments\r\nque nous possédons, les questions fondamentales sont débattues, et\r\nles limites de l’esprit humain sont touchées. Mais en dedans de\r\nces limites, la science trouve, dans une immensité inépuisable de\r\ncombinaisons, les matériaux qui la font grandir; et il est impossible\r\nde ne pas reconnaître que, sur un sol et avec les aliments que lui\r\nfournissent les choses et l’expérience, elle se développe en vertu d’un\r\nprincipe interne de vie, qui reside dans l’enchaînement nécessaire de\r\nson développement successif.”[357]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ON ANCIENT MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n1. Whoever having undertaken to speak or write on Medicine, have first\r\nlaid down for themselves some hypothesis to their argument, such as\r\nhot, or cold, or moist, or dry, or whatever else they choose (thus\r\nreducing their subject within a narrow compass, and supposing only\r\none or two original causes of diseases or of death among mankind),\r\nare all clearly mistaken in much that they say; and this is the more\r\nreprehensible as relating to an art which all men avail themselves\r\nof on the most important occasions, and the good operators and\r\npractitioners in which they hold in especial honor. For there are\r\npractitioners, some bad and some far otherwise, which, if there had\r\nbeen no such thing as Medicine, and if nothing had been investigated\r\nor found out in it, would not have been the case, but all would have\r\nbeen equally unskilled and ignorant of it, and everything concerning\r\nthe sick would have been directed by chance. But now it is not so;\r\nfor, as in all the other arts, those who practise them differ much\r\nfrom one another in dexterity and knowledge, so is it in like manner\r\nwith Medicine. Wherefore I have not thought that it stood in need of\r\nan empty hypothesis, like those subjects which are occult and dubious,\r\nin attempting to handle which it is necessary to use some hypothesis;\r\nas, for example, with regard to things above us and things below the\r\nearth;[358] if any one should treat of these and undertake to declare\r\nhow they are constituted, the reader or hearer could not find out,\r\nwhether what is delivered be true or false; for there is nothing which\r\ncan be referred to in order to discover the truth.\r\n\r\n2. But all these requisites belong of old to Medicine, and an origin\r\nand way have been found out, by which many and elegant discoveries\r\nhave been made, during a length of time, and others will yet be found\r\nout, if a person possessed of the proper ability, and knowing those\r\ndiscoveries which have been made, should proceed from them to prosecute\r\nhis investigations. But whoever, rejecting and despising all these,\r\nattempts to pursue another course and form of inquiry, and says he has\r\ndiscovered anything, is deceived himself and deceives others, for the\r\nthing is impossible. And for what reason it is impossible, I will now\r\nendeavor to explain, by stating and showing what the art really is.\r\nFrom this it will be manifest that discoveries cannot possibly be made\r\nin any other way. And most especially, it appears to me, that whoever\r\ntreats of this art should treat of things which are familiar to the\r\ncommon people. For of nothing else will such a one have to inquire\r\nor treat, but of the diseases under which the common people have\r\nlabored, which diseases and the causes of their origin and departure,\r\ntheir increase and decline, illiterate persons cannot easily find out\r\nthemselves, but still it is easy for them to understand these things\r\nwhen discovered and expounded by others. For it is nothing more than\r\nthat every one is put in mind of what had occurred to himself. But\r\nwhoever does not reach the capacity of the illiterate vulgar and fails\r\nto make them listen to him, misses his mark. Wherefore, then, there is\r\nno necessity for any hypothesis.\r\n\r\n3. For the art of Medicine would not have been invented at first, nor\r\nwould it have been made a subject of investigation (for there would\r\nhave been no need of it), if when men are indisposed, the same food and\r\nother articles of regimen which they eat and drink when in good health\r\nwere proper for them, and if no others were preferable to these. But\r\nnow necessity itself made medicine to be sought out and discovered by\r\nmen, since the same things when administered to the sick, which agreed\r\nwith them when in good health, neither did nor do agree with them. But\r\nto go still further back, I hold that the diet and food which people in\r\nhealth now use would not have been discovered, provided it had suited\r\nwith man to eat and drink in like manner as the ox, the horse, and all\r\nother animals, except man, do of the productions of the earth, such\r\nas fruits, weeds, and grass; for from such things these animals grow,\r\nlive free of disease, and require no other kind of food. And, at first,\r\nI am of opinion that man used the same sort of food, and that the\r\npresent articles of diet had been discovered and invented only after a\r\nlong lapse of time. For when they suffered much and severely from this\r\nstrong and brutish diet, swallowing things which were raw, unmixed,\r\nand possessing great strength, they became exposed to strong pains and\r\ndiseases, and to early deaths. It is likely, indeed, that from habit\r\nthey would suffer less from these things then than we would now, but\r\nstill they would suffer severely even then; and it is likely that the\r\ngreater number, and those who had weaker constitutions, would all\r\nperish; whereas the stronger would hold out for a longer time, as even\r\nnowadays some, in consequence of using strong articles of food, get\r\noff with little trouble, but others with much pain and suffering. From\r\nthis necessity it appears to me that they would search out the food\r\nbefitting their nature, and thus discover that which we now use: and\r\nthat from wheat, by macerating it, stripping it of its hull, grinding\r\nit all down, sifting, toasting, and baking it, they formed bread;[359]\r\nand from barley they formed cake (maza),[360] performing many\r\noperations in regard to it; they boiled, they roasted, they mixed, they\r\ndiluted those things which are strong and of intense qualities with\r\nweaker things, fashioning them to the nature and powers of man, and\r\nconsidering that the stronger things Nature would not be able to manage\r\nif administered, and that from such things pains, diseases, and death\r\nwould arise, but such as Nature could manage, that from them food,\r\ngrowth, and health, would arise. To such a discovery and investigation\r\nwhat more suitable name could one give than that of Medicine? since it\r\nwas discovered for the health of man, for his nourishment and safety,\r\nas a substitute for that kind of diet by which pains, diseases, and\r\ndeaths were occasioned.\r\n\r\n4. And if this is not held to be an art, I do not object. For it is not\r\nsuitable to call any one an artist of that which no one is ignorant of,\r\nbut which all know from usage and necessity. But still the discovery is\r\na great one, and requiring much art and investigation. Wherefore those\r\nwho devote themselves to gymnastics and training, are always making\r\nsome new discovery, by pursuing the same line of inquiry, where, by\r\neating and drinking certain things, they are improved and grow stronger\r\nthan they were.[361]\r\n\r\n5. Let us inquire then regarding what is admitted to be Medicine;\r\nnamely, that which was invented for the sake of the sick, which\r\npossesses a name and practitioners, whether it also seeks to accomplish\r\nthe same objects, and whence it derived its origin. To me, then, it\r\nappears, as I said at the commencement, that nobody would have sought\r\nfor medicine at all, provided the same kinds of diet had suited with\r\nmen in sickness as in good health. Wherefore, even yet, such races of\r\nmen as make no use of medicine, namely, barbarians, and even certain\r\nof the Greeks, live in the same way when sick as when in health; that\r\nit to say, they take what suits their appetite, and neither abstain\r\nfrom, nor restrict themselves in anything for which they have a desire.\r\nBut those who have cultivated and invented medicine, having the same\r\nobject in view as those of whom I formerly spoke, in the first place,\r\nI suppose, diminished the quantity of the articles of food which they\r\nused, and this alone would be sufficient for certain of the sick, and\r\nbe manifestly beneficial to them, although not to all, for there would\r\nbe some so affected as not to be able to manage even small quantities\r\nof their usual food, and as such persons would seem to require\r\nsomething weaker, they invented soups, by mixing a few strong things\r\nwith much water, and thus abstracting that which was strong in them by\r\ndilution and boiling. But such as could not manage even soups, laid\r\nthem aside, and had recourse to drinks, and so regulated them as to\r\nmixture and quantity, that they were administered neither stronger nor\r\nweaker than what was required.\r\n\r\n6. But this ought to be well known, that soups do not agree with\r\ncertain persons in their diseases, but, on the contrary, when\r\nadministered both the fevers and the pains are exacerbated, and it\r\nbecomes obvious that what was given has proved food and increase to the\r\ndisease, but a wasting and weakness to the body. But whatever persons\r\nso affected partook of solid food, or cake, or bread, even in small\r\nquantity, would be ten times and more decidedly injured than those who\r\nhad taken soups, for no other reason than from the strength of the food\r\nin reference to the affection: and to whomsoever it is proper to take\r\nsoups and not eat solid food, such a one will be much more injured\r\nif he eat much than if he eat little, but even little food will be\r\ninjurious to him. But all the causes of the sufferance refer themselves\r\nto this rule, that the strongest things most especially and decidedly\r\nhurt man, whether in health or in disease.\r\n\r\n7. What other object, then, had he in view who is called a physician,\r\nand is admitted to be a practitioner of the art, who found out the\r\nregimen and diet befitting the sick, than he who originally found\r\nout and prepared for all mankind that kind of food which we all now\r\nuse, in place of the former savage and brutish mode of living? To me\r\nit appears that the mode is the same, and the discovery of a similar\r\nnature. The one sought to abstract those things which the constitution\r\nof man cannot digest, because of their wildness and intemperature, and\r\nthe other those things which are beyond the powers of the affection in\r\nwhich any one may happen to be laid up. Now, how does the one differ\r\nfrom the other, except that the latter admits of greater variety, and\r\nrequires more application, whereas the former was the commencement of\r\nthe process?\r\n\r\n8. And if one would compare the diet of sick persons with that of\r\npersons in health, he will find it not more injurious than that of\r\nhealthy persons in comparison with that of wild beasts and of other\r\nanimals. For, suppose a man laboring under one of those diseases which\r\nare neither serious and unsupportable, nor yet altogether mild, but\r\nsuch as that, upon making any mistake in diet, it will become apparent,\r\nas if he should eat bread and flesh, or any other of those articles\r\nwhich prove beneficial to healthy persons, and that, too, not in great\r\nquantity, but much less than he could have taken when in good health;\r\nand that another man in good health, having a constitution neither\r\nvery feeble, nor yet strong, eats of those things which are wholesome\r\nand strengthening to an ox or a horse, such as vetches, barley, and\r\nthe like, and that, too, not in great quantity, but much less than he\r\ncould take; the healthy person who did so would be subjected to no\r\nless disturbance and danger than the sick person who took bread or\r\ncake unseasonably. All these things are proofs that Medicine is to be\r\nprosecuted and discovered by the same method as the other.\r\n\r\n9. And if it were simply, as is laid down, that such things as are\r\nstronger prove injurious, but such as are weaker prove beneficial and\r\nnourishing, both to sick and healthy persons, it were an easy matter,\r\nfor then the safest rule would be to circumscribe the diet to the\r\nlowest point. But then it is no less mistake, nor one that injures\r\na man less, provided a deficient diet, or one consisting of weaker\r\nthings than what are proper, be administered. For, in the constitution\r\nof man, abstinence may enervate, weaken, and kill. And there are many\r\nother ills, different from those of repletion, but no less dreadful,\r\narising from deficiency of food; wherefore the practice in those cases\r\nis more varied, and requires greater accuracy. For one must aim at\r\nattaining a certain measure, and yet this measure admits neither weight\r\nnor calculation of any kind, by which it may be accurately determined,\r\nunless it be the sensation of the body; wherefore it is a task to\r\nlearn this accurately, so as not to commit small blunders either on\r\nthe one side or the other, and in fact I would give great praise to\r\nthe physician whose mistakes are small, for perfect accuracy is seldom\r\nto be seen, since many physicians seem to me to be in the same plight\r\nas bad pilots, who, if they commit mistakes while conducting the ship\r\nin a calm do not expose themselves, but when a storm and violent\r\nhurricane overtake them, they then, from their ignorance and mistakes,\r\nare discovered to be what they are, by all men, namely, in losing their\r\nship. And thus bad and commonplace physicians, when they treat men who\r\nhave no serious illness, in which case one may commit great mistakes\r\nwithout producing any formidable mischief, (and such complaints\r\noccur much more frequently to men than dangerous ones); under these\r\ncircumstances, when they commit mistakes, they do not expose themselves\r\nto ordinary men; but when they fall in with a great, a strong, and\r\na dangerous disease, then their mistakes and want of skill are made\r\napparent to all. Their punishment is not far off, but is swift in\r\novertaking both the one and the other.[362]\r\n\r\n10. And that no less mischief happens to a man from unseasonable\r\ndepletion than from repletion, may be clearly seen upon reverting to\r\nthe consideration of persons in health. For, to some, with whom it\r\nagrees to take only one meal in the day, and they have arranged it so\r\naccordingly; whilst others, for the same reason, also take dinner, and\r\nthis they do because they find it good for them, and not like those\r\npersons who, for pleasure or from any casual circumstance, adopt the\r\none or the other custom: and to the bulk of mankind it is of little\r\nconsequence which of these rules they observe, that is to say, whether\r\nthey make it a practice to take one or two meals. But there are certain\r\npersons who cannot readily change their diet with impunity; and if they\r\nmake any alteration in it for one day, or even for a part of a day,\r\nare greatly injured thereby. Such persons, provided they take dinner\r\nwhen it is not their wont, immediately become heavy and inactive,\r\nboth in body and mind, and are weighed down with yawning, slumbering,\r\nand thirst; and if they take supper in addition, they are seized with\r\nflatulence, tormina, and diarrhœa, and to many this has been the\r\ncommencement of a serious disease, when they have merely taken twice\r\nin a day the same food which they have been in the custom of taking\r\nonce. And thus, also, if one who has been accustomed to dine, and\r\nthis rule agrees with him, should not dine at the accustomed hour, he\r\nwill straightway feel great loss of strength, trembling, and want of\r\nspirits, the eyes of such a person will become more pallid, his urine\r\nthick and hot, his mouth bitter; his bowels will seem, as it were,\r\nto hang loose; he will suffer from vertigo, lowness of spirit, and\r\ninactivity,--such are the effects; and if he should attempt to take\r\nat supper the same food which he was wont to partake of at dinner,\r\nit will appear insipid, and he will not be able to take it off; and\r\nthese things, passing downwards with tormina and rumbling, burn up his\r\nbowels; he experiences insomnolency or troubled and disturbed dreams;\r\nand to many of them these symptoms are the commencement of some disease.\r\n\r\n11. But let us inquire what are the causes of these things which\r\nhappened to them. To him, then, who was accustomed to take only one\r\nmeal in the day, they happened because he did not wait the proper time,\r\nuntil his bowels had completely derived benefit from and had digested\r\nthe articles taken at the preceding meal, and until his belly had\r\nbecome soft, and got into a state of rest, but he gave it a new supply\r\nwhile in a state of heat and fermentation, for such bellies digest much\r\nmore slowly, and require more rest and ease. And as to him who had\r\nbeen accustomed to dinner, since, as soon as the body required food,\r\nand when the former meal was consumed, and he wanted refreshment, no\r\nnew supply was furnished to it, he wastes and is consumed from want of\r\nfood. For all the symptoms which I describe as befalling to this man I\r\nrefer to want of food. And I also say that all men who, when in a state\r\nof health, remain for two or three days without food, experience the\r\nsame unpleasant symptoms as those which I described in the case of him\r\nwho had omitted to take dinner.\r\n\r\n12. Wherefore, I say, that such constitutions as suffer quickly and\r\nstrongly from errors in diet, are weaker than others that do not; and\r\nthat a weak person is in a state very nearly approaching to one in\r\ndisease; but a person in disease is the weaker, and it is, therefore,\r\nmore likely that he should suffer if he encounters anything that is\r\nunseasonable. It is difficult, seeing that there is no such accuracy\r\nin the Art, to hit always upon what is most expedient, and yet many\r\ncases occur in medicine which would require this accuracy, as we shall\r\nexplain. But on that account, I say, we ought not to reject the ancient\r\nArt, as if it were not, and had not been properly founded, because it\r\ndid not attain accuracy in all things, but rather, since it is capable\r\nof reaching to the greatest exactitude by reasoning, to receive it and\r\nadmire its discoveries, made from a state of great ignorance, and as\r\nhaving been well and properly made, and not from chance.\r\n\r\n13. But I wish the discourse to revert to the new method of those\r\nwho prosecute their inquiries in the Art by hypothesis. For if hot,\r\nor cold, or moist, or dry, be that which proves injurious to man, and\r\nif the person who would treat him properly must apply cold to the\r\nhot, hot to the cold, moist to the dry, and dry to the moist--let me\r\nbe presented with a man, not indeed one of a strong constitution, but\r\none of the weaker, and let him eat wheat, such as it is supplied from\r\nthe thrashing-floor, raw and unprepared, with raw meat, and let him\r\ndrink water. By using such a diet I know that he will suffer much and\r\nseverely, for he will experience pains, his body will become weak, and\r\nhis bowels deranged, and he will not subsist long. What remedy, then,\r\nis to be provided for one so situated? Hot? or cold? or moist? or dry?\r\nFor it is clear that it must be one or other of these. For, according\r\nto this principle, if it is one of these which is injuring the patient,\r\nit is to be removed by its contrary. But the surest and most obvious\r\nremedy is to change the diet which the person used, and instead of\r\nwheat to give bread, and instead of raw flesh, boiled, and to drink\r\nwine in addition to these: for by making these changes it is impossible\r\nbut that he must get better, unless completely disorganized by time and\r\ndiet. What, then, shall we say? whether that, as he suffered from cold,\r\nthese hot things being applied were of use to him, or the contrary? I\r\nshould think this question must prove a puzzler to whomsoever it is\r\nput. For whether did he who prepared bread out of wheat remove the hot,\r\nthe cold, the moist, or the dry principle in it?--for the bread is\r\nconsigned both to fire and to water, and is wrought with many things,\r\neach of which has its peculiar property and nature, some of which it\r\nloses, and with others it is diluted and mixed.\r\n\r\n14. And this I know, moreover, that to the human body it makes a great\r\ndifference whether the bread be fine or coarse;[363] of wheat with or\r\nwithout the hull, whether mixed with much or little water, strongly\r\nwrought or scarcely at all, baked or raw--and a multitude of similar\r\ndifferences; and so, in like manner, with the cake (maza); the powers\r\nof each, too, are great, and the one nowise like the other. Whoever\r\npays no attention to these things, or, paying attention, does not\r\ncomprehend them, how can he understand the diseases which befall a\r\nman? For, by every one of these things, a man is affected and changed\r\nthis way or that, and the whole of his life is subjected to them,\r\nwhether in health, convalescence, or disease. Nothing else, then, can\r\nbe more important or more necessary to know than these things. So that\r\nthe first inventors, pursuing their investigations properly, and by a\r\nsuitable train of reasoning, according to the nature of man, made their\r\ndiscoveries, and thought the Art worthy of being ascribed to a god, as\r\nis the established belief. For they did not suppose that the dry or\r\nthe moist, the hot or the cold, or any of these, are either injurious\r\nto man, or that man stands in need of them; but whatever in each was\r\nstrong, and more than a match for a man’s constitution, whatever he\r\ncould not manage, that they held to be hurtful, and sought to remove.\r\nNow, of the sweet, the strongest is that which is intensely sweet; of\r\nthe bitter, that which is intensely bitter; of the acid, that which\r\nis intensely acid; and of all things that which is extreme, for these\r\nthings they saw both existing in man, and proving injurious to him.\r\nFor there is in man the bitter and the salt, the sweet and the acid,\r\nthe sour and the insipid,[364] and a multitude of other things having\r\nall sorts of powers both as regards quantity and strength. These, when\r\nall mixed and mingled up with one another, are not apparent, neither\r\ndo they hurt a man; but when any of them is separate, and stands by\r\nitself, then it becomes perceptible, and hurts a man. And thus, of\r\narticles of food, those which are unsuitable and hurtful to man when\r\nadministered, every one is either bitter, or intensely so, or saltish\r\nor acid, or something else intense and strong, and therefore we are\r\ndisordered by them in like manner as we are by the secretions in the\r\nbody. But all those things of which a man eats and drinks are devoid\r\nof any such intense and well-marked quality, such as bread, cake, and\r\nmany other things of a similar nature which man is accustomed to use\r\nfor food, with the exception of condiments and confectionaries, which\r\nare made to gratify the palate and for luxury. And from those things,\r\nwhen received into the body abundantly, there is no disorder nor\r\ndissolution of the powers belonging to the body; but strength, growth,\r\nand nourishment result from them, and this for no other reason than\r\nbecause they are well mixed, have nothing in them of an immoderate\r\ncharacter, nor anything strong, but the whole forms one simple and not\r\nstrong substance.\r\n\r\n15. I cannot think in what manner they who advance this doctrine,\r\nand transfer the Art from the cause I have described to hypothesis,\r\nwill cure men according to the principle which they have laid down.\r\nFor, as far as I know, neither the hot nor the cold, nor the dry, nor\r\nthe moist, has ever been found unmixed with any other quality; but I\r\nsuppose they use the same articles of meat and drink as all we other\r\nmen do. But to this substance they give the attribute of being hot, to\r\nthat cold, to that dry, and to that moist. Since it would be absurd to\r\nadvise the patient to take something hot, for he would straightway ask\r\nwhat it is? so that he must either play the fool, or have recourse to\r\nsome one of the well-known substances: and if this hot thing happen\r\nto be sour, and that hot thing insipid, and this hot thing has the\r\npower of raising a disturbance in the body (and there are many other\r\nkinds of heat, possessing many opposite powers), he will be obliged\r\nto administer some one of them, either the hot and the sour, or the\r\nhot and the insipid, or that which, at the same time, is cold and sour\r\n(for there is such a substance), or the cold and the insipid. For, as\r\nI think, the very opposite effects will result from either of these,\r\nnot only in man, but also in a bladder, a vessel of wood, and in many\r\nother things possessed of far less sensibility than man; for it is not\r\nthe heat which is possessed of great efficacy, but the sour and the\r\ninsipid, and other qualities as described by me, both in man and out\r\nof man, and that whether eaten or drunk, rubbed in externally, and\r\notherwise applied.\r\n\r\n16. But I think that of all the qualities heat and cold exercise the\r\nleast operation in the body, for these reasons: as long time as hot\r\nand cold are mixed up with one another they do not give trouble, for\r\nthe cold is attempered and rendered more moderate by the hot, and\r\nthe hot by the cold; but when the one is wholly separate from the\r\nother, then it gives pain; and at that season when cold is applied it\r\ncreates some pain to a man, but quickly, for that very reason, heat\r\nspontaneously arises in him without requiring any aid or preparation.\r\nAnd these things operate thus both upon men in health and in disease.\r\nFor example, if a person in health wishes to cool his body during\r\nwinter, and bathes either in cold water or in any other way, the more\r\nhe does this, unless his body be fairly congealed, when he resumes his\r\nclothes and comes into a place of shelter, his body becomes more heated\r\nthan before. And thus, too, if a person wish to be warmed thoroughly\r\neither by means of a hot bath or strong fire, and straightway having\r\nthe same clothing on, takes up his abode again in the place he was in\r\nwhen he became congealed, he will appear much colder, and more disposed\r\nto chills than before. And if a person fan himself on account of a\r\nsuffocating heat, and having procured refrigeration for himself in this\r\nmanner, cease doing so, the heat and suffocation will be ten times\r\ngreater in his case than in that of a person who does nothing of the\r\nkind. And, to give a more striking example, persons travelling in the\r\nsnow, or otherwise in rigorous weather, and contracting great cold in\r\ntheir feet, their hands, or their head, what do they not suffer from\r\ninflammation and tingling when they put on warm clothing and get into\r\na hot place? In some instances, blisters arise as if from burning with\r\nfire, and they do not suffer from any of those unpleasant symptoms\r\nuntil they become heated. So readily does either of these pass into\r\nthe other; and I could mention many other examples. And with regard\r\nto the sick, is it not in those who experience a rigor that the most\r\nacute fever is apt to break out? And yet not so strongly neither,\r\nbut that it ceases in a short time, and, for the most part, without\r\nhaving occasioned much mischief; and while it remains, it is hot,\r\nand passing over the whole body, ends for the most part in the feet,\r\nwhere the chills and cold were most intense and lasted longest: and,\r\nwhen sweat supervenes, and the fever passes off, the patient is much\r\ncolder than if he had not taken the fever at all. Why then should that\r\nwhich so quickly passes into the opposite extreme, and loses its own\r\npowers spontaneously, be reckoned a mighty and serious affair? And what\r\nnecessity is there for any great remedy for it?\r\n\r\n17. One might here say--but persons in ardent fevers, pneumonia, and\r\nother formidable diseases, do not quickly get rid of the heat, nor\r\nexperience these rapid alterations of heat and cold. And I reckon this\r\nvery circumstance the strongest proof that it is not from heat simply\r\nthat men get into the febrile state, neither is it the sole cause of\r\nthe mischief, but that this species of heat is bitter, and that acid,\r\nand the other saltish, and many other varieties; and again there is\r\ncold combined with other qualities. These are what proves injurious:\r\nheat, it is true, is present also, possessed of strength as being that\r\nwhich conducts, is exacerbated and increased along with the other, but\r\nhas no power greater than what is peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n18. With regard to these symptoms, in the first place those are most\r\nobvious of which we have all often had experience. Thus, then, in such\r\nof us as have a coryza and defluction from the nostrils, this discharge\r\nis much more acrid than that which formerly was formed in and ran from\r\nthem daily; and it occasions swelling of the nose, and it inflames,\r\nbeing of a hot and extremely ardent nature, as you may know, if you\r\napply your hand to the place; and, if the disease remains long, the\r\npart becomes ulcerated although destitute of flesh and hard; and the\r\nheat in the nose ceases, not when the defluxion takes place and the\r\ninflammation is present, but when the running becomes thicker and less\r\nacrid, and more mixed with the former secretion, then it is that the\r\nheat ceases. But in all those cases in which this decidedly proceeds\r\nfrom cold alone, without the concourse of any other quality, there is\r\na change from cold to hot, and from hot to cold, and these quickly\r\nsupervene, and require no coction. But all the others being connected,\r\nas I have said, with acrimony and intemperance of humors, pass off in\r\nthis way by being mixed and concocted.\r\n\r\n19. But such defluxions as are determined to the eyes being possessed\r\nof strong and varied acrimonies, ulcerate the eyelids, and in some\r\ncases corrode the cheeks and parts below the eyes upon which the flow,\r\nand even occasion rupture and erosion of the tunic which surrounds\r\nthe eyeball. But pain, heat, and extreme burning prevail until the\r\ndefluxions are concocted and become thicker, and concretions form about\r\nthe eyes, and the coction takes place from the fluids being mixed up,\r\ndiluted, and digested together. And in defluxions upon the throat,\r\nfrom which are formed hoarseness, cynanche, erysipelas, and pneumonia,\r\nall these have at first saltish, watery, and acrid discharges, and\r\nwith these the diseases gain strength. But when the discharges become\r\nthicker, more concocted, and are freed from all acrimony, then, indeed,\r\nthe fevers pass away, and the other symptoms which annoyed the patient;\r\nfor we must account those things the cause of each complaint, which,\r\nbeing present in a certain fashion, the complaint exists, but it ceases\r\nwhen they change to another combination. But those which originate from\r\npure heat or cold, and do not participate in any other quality, will\r\nthen cease when they undergo a change from cold to hot, and from hot to\r\ncold; and they change in the manner I have described before. Wherefore,\r\nall the other complaints to which man is subject arise from powers\r\n(qualities?). Thus, when there is an overflow of the bitter principle,\r\nwhich we call yellow bile, what anxiety, burning heat, and loss of\r\nstrength prevail! but if relieved from it, either by being purged\r\nspontaneously, or by means of a medicine seasonably administered, the\r\npatient is decidedly relieved of the pains and heat; but while these\r\nthings float on the stomach, unconcocted and undigested, no contrivance\r\ncould make the pains and fever cease; and when there are acidities of\r\nan acrid and æruginous character, what varieties of frenzy, gnawing\r\npains in the bowels and chest, and inquietude, prevail! and these\r\ndo not cease until the acidities be purged away, or are calmed down\r\nand mixed with other fluids. The coction, change, attenuation, and\r\nthickening into the form of humors, take place through many and\r\nvarious forms; therefore the crises and calculations of time are of\r\ngreat importance in such matters; but to all such changes hot and cold\r\nare but little exposed, for these are neither liable to putrefaction\r\nnor thickening. What then shall we say of the change? that it is a\r\ncombination (crasis) of these humors having different powers toward one\r\nanother. But the hot does not lose its heat when mixed with any other\r\nthing except the cold; nor again, the cold, except when mixed with the\r\nhot. But all other things connected with man become the more mild and\r\nbetter in proportion as they are mixed with the more things besides.\r\nBut a man is in the best possible state when they are concocted and\r\nat rest, exhibiting no one peculiar quality; but I think I have said\r\nenough in explanation of them.\r\n\r\n20. Certain sophists and physicians say that it is not possible for\r\nany one to know medicine who does not know what man is [and how he was\r\nmade and how constructed], and that whoever would cure men properly,\r\nmust learn this in the first place. But this saying rather appertains\r\nto philosophy, as Empedocles and certain others have described what man\r\nin his origin is, and how he first was made and constructed.[365] But\r\nI think whatever such has been said or written by sophist or physician\r\nconcerning nature has less connection with the art of medicine than\r\nwith the art of painting. And I think that one cannot know anything\r\ncertain respecting nature from any other quarter than from medicine;\r\nand that this knowledge is to be attained when one comprehends the\r\nwhole subject of medicine properly, but not until then; and I say\r\nthat this history shows what man is, by what causes he was made,\r\nand other things accurately. Wherefore it appears to me necessary\r\nto every physician to be skilled in nature, and strive to know, if\r\nhe would wish to perform his duties, what man is in relation to the\r\narticles of food and drink, and to his other occupations, and what\r\nare the effects of each of them to every one. And it is not enough\r\nto know simply that cheese is a bad article of food, as disagreeing\r\nwith whoever eats of it to satiety, but what sort of disturbance it\r\ncreates, and wherefore, and with what principle in man it disagrees;\r\nfor there are many other articles of food and drink naturally bad which\r\naffect man in a different manner. Thus, to illustrate my meaning by an\r\nexample, undiluted wine drunk in large quantity renders a man feeble;\r\nand everybody seeing this knows that such is the power of wine, and\r\nthe cause thereof; and we know, moreover, on what parts of a man’s\r\nbody it principally exerts its action; and I wish the same certainty\r\nto appear in other cases. For cheese (since we used it as an example)\r\ndoes not prove equally injurious to all men, for there are some who can\r\ntake it to satiety without being hurt by it in the least, but, on the\r\ncontrary, it is wonderful what strength it imparts to those it agrees\r\nwith; but there are some who do not bear it well, their constitutions\r\nare different, and they differ in this respect, that what in their body\r\nis incompatible with cheese, is roused and put in commotion by such a\r\nthing; and those in whose bodies such a humor happens to prevail in\r\ngreater quantity and intensity, are likely to suffer the more from it.\r\nBut if the thing had been pernicious to the whole nature of man, it\r\nwould have hurt all. Whoever knows these things will not suffer from it.\r\n\r\n21. During convalescence from diseases, and also in protracted\r\ndiseases, many disorders occur, some spontaneously, and some from\r\ncertain things accidentally administered. I know that the common herd\r\nof physicians, like the vulgar, if there happen to have been any\r\ninnovation made about that day, such as the bath being used, a walk\r\ntaken, or any unusual food eaten, all which were better done than\r\notherwise, attribute notwithstanding the cause of these disorders, to\r\nsome of these things, being ignorant of the true cause but proscribing\r\nwhat may have been very proper. Now this ought not to be so; but one\r\nshould know the effects of a bath or a walk unseasonably applied; for\r\nthus there will never be any mischief from these things, nor from any\r\nother thing, nor from repletion, nor from such and such an article of\r\nfood. Whoever does not know what effect these things produce upon a\r\nman, cannot know the consequences which result from them, nor how to\r\napply them.\r\n\r\n22. And it appears to me that one ought also to know what diseases\r\narise in man from the powers, and what from the structures. What do\r\nI mean by this? By powers, I mean intense and strong juices; and by\r\nstructures, whatever conformations there are in man. For some are\r\nhollow, and from broad contracted into narrow; some expanded, some hard\r\nand round, some broad and suspended,[366] some stretched, some long,\r\nsome dense, some rare and succulent,[367] some spongy and of loose\r\ntexture.[368] Now, then, which of these figures is the best calculated\r\nto suck to itself and attract humidity from another body? Whether\r\nwhat is hollow and expanded, or what is solid and round, or what is\r\nhollow, and from broad, gradually turning narrow? I think such as from\r\nhollow and broad are contracted into narrow: this may be ascertained\r\notherwise from obvious facts: thus, if you gape wide with the mouth\r\nyou cannot draw in any liquid; but by protruding, contracting, and\r\ncompressing the lips, and still more by using a tube, you can readily\r\ndraw in whatever you wish. And thus, too, the instruments which are\r\nused for cupping are broad below and gradually become narrow, and are\r\nso constructed in order to suck and draw in from the fleshy parts.\r\nThe nature and construction of the parts within a man are of a like\r\nnature; the bladder, the head, the uterus in woman; these parts clearly\r\nattract, and are always filled with a juice which is foreign to them.\r\nThose parts which are hollow and expanded are most likely to receive\r\nany humidity flowing into them, but cannot attract it in like manner.\r\nThose parts which are solid and round could not attract a humidity, nor\r\nreceive it when it flows to them, for it would glide past, and find no\r\nplace of rest on them. But spongy and rare parts, such as the spleen,\r\nthe lungs, and the breasts, drink up especially the juices around them,\r\nand become hardened and enlarged by the accession of juices. Such\r\nthings happen to these organs especially. For it is not with the spleen\r\nas with the stomach, in which there is a liquid, which it contains and\r\nevacuates every day; but when it (the spleen) drinks up and receives a\r\nfluid into itself, the hollow and lax parts of it are filled, even the\r\nsmall interstices; and, instead of being rare and soft, it becomes hard\r\nand dense, and it can neither digest nor discharge its contents: these\r\nthings it suffers, owing to the nature of its structure. Those things\r\nwhich engender flatulence or tormina in the body, naturally do so in\r\nthe hollow and broad parts of the body, such as the stomach and chest,\r\nwhere they produce rumbling noises; for when they do not fill the\r\nparts so as to be stationary, but have changes of place and movements,\r\nthere must necessarily be noise and apparent movements from them. But\r\nsuch parts as are fleshy and soft, in these there occur torpor and\r\nobstructions, such as happen in apoplexy. But when it (the flatus?)\r\nencounters a broad and resisting structure, and rushes against such a\r\npart, and this happens when it is by nature not strong so as to be able\r\nto withstand it without suffering injury; nor soft and rare, so as to\r\nreceive or yield to it, but tender, juicy, full of blood, and dense,\r\nlike the liver, owing to its density and broadness, it resists and does\r\nnot yield. But flatus, when it obtains admission, increases and becomes\r\nstronger, and rushes toward any resisting object; but owing to its\r\ntenderness, and the quantity of blood which it (the liver) contains,\r\nit cannot be without uneasiness; and for these reasons the most acute\r\nand frequent pains occur in the region of it, along with suppurations\r\nand chronic tumors (phymata). These symptoms also occur in the site of\r\nthe diaphragm, but much less frequently; for the diaphragm is a broad,\r\nexpanded, and resisting substance, of a nervous (tendinous?) and strong\r\nnature, and therefore less susceptible of pain; and yet pains and\r\nchronic abscesses do occur about it.\r\n\r\n23. There are both within and without the body many other kinds of\r\nstructure, which differ much from one another as to sufferings both in\r\nhealth and disease; such as whether the head be small or large; the\r\nneck slender or thick, long or short; the belly long or round; the\r\nchest and ribs broad or narrow; and many others besides, all which you\r\nought to be acquainted with, and their differences; so that knowing the\r\ncauses of each, you may make the more accurate observations.\r\n\r\n24. And, as has been formerly stated, one ought to be acquainted\r\nwith the powers of juices, and what action each of them has upon\r\nman, and their alliances towards one another. What I say is this: if\r\na sweet juice change to another kind, net from any admixture, but\r\nbecause it has undergone a mutation within itself; what does it first\r\nbecome?--bitter? salt? austere? or acid? I think acid. And hence, an\r\nacid juice is the most improper of all things that can be administered\r\nin cases in which a sweet juice is the most proper. Thus, if one\r\nshould succeed in his investigations of external things, he would be\r\nthe better able always to select the best; for that is best which is\r\nfarthest removed from that which is unwholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ON AIRS, WATERS, AND PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nDr. Coray, in his excellent edition of this treatise, divides it\r\ninto six chapters, as follows: first, the Introduction (from § 1–3)\r\ncomprehends some general observations on the importance of cultivating\r\na knowledge of the effects which the different seasons, the winds, the\r\nvarious kinds of water, the situation of cities, the nature of soils\r\nand the modes of life, exercise upon the health, and the necessity of\r\na physician’s making himself well acquainted with all these matters,\r\nif he would wish to practise his profession successfully. The author\r\ninsists, with particular earnestness, on the utility of studying the\r\nconstitution of the year and the nature of the seasons, and refutes the\r\nopinions of those persons, in his days, who held that a knowledge of\r\nall these things belongs to meteorology rather than to medicine. The\r\nsecond chapter (§ 3–7) treats of climate, and the diseases prevalent in\r\nlocalities characterized by their exposure to particular winds. Those\r\nwinds being peculiar to Greece, their names occasion some trouble in\r\norder to understand them correctly, and we shall give below a summary\r\nof what the modern Greek Coray says in illustration of them. This part\r\nof the present treatise appears to have been highly elaborated, and\r\ncontains much important information. The third chapter (§ 7–10) treats\r\nof the various kinds of water, and their effects in different states of\r\nthe human constitution. The remarks contained here are of an eminently\r\npractical nature, and evidently must have been the results of patient\r\nobservation and experiment, so that, even at the present day, it would\r\nbe difficult to detect our author in a single error of judgment. In\r\nthis place he has occasion to deliver his opinions on the formation of\r\nurinary calculi, which he does at considerable length; and I may be\r\npermitted to remark, whatever may be thought of his etiology of the\r\ndisease, it will be admitted that his theory is plausible, and the best\r\nthat could well have been framed in the state of knowledge which then\r\nprevailed on that subject. Indeed, even at the present day, it must\r\nbe allowed that this is a dark subject; we have acquired, it is true,\r\nmany new and curious facts connected with the minute structure of these\r\nconcretions, but it can hardly be affirmed that we have been able to\r\nevolve from them any general principles, or certain rules of practice.\r\nIn the fourth chapter (§ 10–12), the nature of the seasons is treated\r\nof, and their influence on the health circumstantially stated. Some\r\nof the observations contained in this part of the work are remarkable\r\nfor their acuteness and originality, such as the following, that, in\r\nestimating the effects of a season on the health, we ought to take\r\ninto account the seasons which preceded it. This is well expressed by\r\nCelsus, as follows: “neque solum interest quales dies sint sed etiam\r\nquales præcesserint.” (Præfat.) See also Hippocrates (de Humoribus, §\r\n8); and Coray (ad h. 1. § cix.) It will be seen in our annotations that\r\na considerable number of the Aphorisms are abstracted from this part of\r\nthe present treatise. In the fifth chapter (§ 12–17), the effects of\r\nclimate and the institutions of society on the inhabitants of Asia are\r\ntreated of at considerable length. Our author, in this place, evinces\r\na great acquaintance with human life, and a most philosophical spirit\r\nin contemplating the subject which he is handling. Indeed few works in\r\nany language display so much accurate observation and originality of\r\nthought. The varieties of disposition, and of intellectual and moral\r\ndevelopment among mankind, are set down as being derived, in a great\r\nmeasure, from differences of climate and modes of government. Thus the\r\nAsiatics are of an effeminate and slavish disposition, because they\r\nlive in a soft climate, on a rich soil, where they are little exposed\r\nto hardships or labor, and under a despotic form of government, which\r\narrests the development of their mental energies.[369] This part also\r\ncontains some interesting observations on the Macrocephali and the\r\ninhabitants of Phasis. In the sixth and last chapter (§ 17 to the\r\nend), the peculiar traits of the European character, as connected with\r\nclimate and institutions, are described in a very interesting manner.\r\nHere the observations on the Amazons, Sauromatæ, and Scythians are\r\nwell deserving of an attentive perusal, and more particularly the\r\ndescription of the disease induced by continual riding on horseback,\r\nthe probable nature of which we shall consider presently. Here, too,\r\nare given our author’s remarks on diseases supposed to be divine,\r\nwhich, as we have stated in the Preliminary section on his life, evince\r\na wonderful exemption from the superstitious belief of his age, and\r\nindicate an extraordinary depth of thought.\r\n\r\nThis is a general outline of the contents of this treatise, which\r\nis one of the most celebrated in the whole Collection. From what we\r\nhave stated, it will at once be seen that it relates to a subject\r\nof commanding interest, and deserves to be carefully studied, as\r\ncontaining the oldest exposition which we possess of the opinions\r\nentertained by an original and enlightened mind on many important\r\nquestions connected with Public Hygiene and Political Economy, two\r\nsciences which, of late years, have commanded a large amount of\r\nprofessional attention. Whether or not modern experience may confirm\r\nour author’s judgment in every particular case, it surely can neither\r\nbe unprofitable nor uninteresting to ascertain what his opinions on\r\nthese subjects actually were. Let us be thankful, then, that the\r\ndestroying hand of time has spared us so valuable a relic of antiquity;\r\nand, instead of undervaluing our ancient instructor because he shows\r\nhimself ignorant of many truths which we are now familiar with, let us\r\nbe grateful to him for the amount of information which he has supplied\r\nto us, and for setting us an example which it must be both safe and\r\nprofitable for us to follow. Surely great praise is due to the man who\r\nfirst mooted so many important questions, and stated their bearings in\r\ndistinct terms, although he did not always succeed in solving them.[370]\r\n\r\nI may take the present opportunity of mentioning that M. Littré,\r\nwith some appearance of truth, blames Hippocrates for having rather\r\noverrated the influence of climate and institutions, in producing\r\nmilitary valor, which, as he justly remarks, has been proved by\r\nmodern examples to be most intimately connected with discipline, and\r\na knowledge of the arts of war. But if Hippocrates was wrong on this\r\npoint, it was because he did not avail himself properly of the lights\r\nof his own age; for he might have learned from his contemporary,\r\nSocrates, the very doctrine which M. Littré here inculcates. “The\r\nquestion being put to him,” says Xenophon, “whether valor was a thing\r\nthat could be taught, or was natural? I am of opinion, he said, that as\r\none body is born with greater powers than another for enduring labor,\r\nso is one soul produced by nature stronger than another for enduring\r\ndangers. For I see persons brought up under the same institutions and\r\nhabits differing much from one another in courage. But I think that\r\nevery nature may be improved in valour by learning and discipline.\r\nFor it is obvious that the Scythians and Thracians would not dare to\r\ncontend with the Lacedemonians with bucklers and spears; and it is\r\nclear that, the Lacedemonians would not be willing to contend with\r\nthe Thracians with small targets and javelins, or with the Scythians\r\nwith bows and arrows.” (Memorab. iii., 9.) The same doctrine is taught\r\nwith remarkable subtlety of argument and originality of thought in the\r\n“Protagoras” of Plato, (see § 97). If, then, Hippocrates was wrong on\r\nthis head, (which, however, may be doubted), it is clear that he is\r\nnot to be screened by the alleged ignorance of his age, and that he\r\nmight have put himself right by attending to the instructions of a\r\ncontemporary with whom he, in all probability, was familiar, and who\r\nundoubtedly was the greatest master of human nature that ever existed.\r\n\r\nAs there are certain matters connected with this treatise which will\r\nrequire a more lengthened discussion than can well suit with foot\r\nnotes, I think it advisable to treat of them in this place:--\r\n\r\n1. With regard to the seasons of the year, as indicated try the\r\nrisings and settings of the stars. the following observations, taken in\r\na great measure from Clifton’s Preface will supply, in as brief a space\r\nas possible, all the information that will be required; “As the reader\r\nwill find frequent mention of seasons, equinoxes, solstices, risings\r\nand settings of the sun and stars (particularly Arcturus, the Dog-star,\r\nand the Pleiades), it may not be amiss to premise, in the first place,\r\nthat a year was divided by the ancients into four parts, every one of\r\nthese was distinguished astronomically.\r\n\r\n“Thus, for instance, the winter began at the setting of the Pleiades,\r\nand continued to the vernal equinox.\r\n\r\n“The spring began at the vernal equinox, and ended at the rising of the\r\nPleiades.\r\n\r\n“The summer began at the rising of the Pleiades, and ended at the\r\nrising of Arcturus.\r\n\r\n“The autumn began at the rising of Arcturus, and ended at the setting\r\nof the Pleiades.\r\n\r\n“The rising and setting of the stars is always to be understood of what\r\nastronomers call the heliacal rising or setting, i. e. when a star\r\nrises or sets with the sun.\r\n\r\n“The rising and setting of the sun in summer or winter (an expression\r\nwhich often occurs in this treatise), implies those points of the\r\ncompass the sun rises and sets at.”[371]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nII. On the winds, of which frequent mention is made by our author,\r\nCoray has treated with a degree of prolixity and earnestness for which\r\nit is difficult to recognize the necessity. The figure given above, if\r\nproperly studied and understood, will supply the professional reader\r\nwith all the information he will require on this head.\r\n\r\nIII. One of the most singular diseases noticed in this work is the\r\neffeminacy with which the Scythians are said to have been attacked in\r\nconsequence of spending the greater part of their time on horseback.\r\n(See § 22.) As the subject has attracted a good deal of attention\r\nlately, I will give a summary of the information which has been\r\ncollected respecting it. See Coray, etc., t. ii., p. 331; Littré, t.\r\nii., p. 5, 6; and Avert., xxxix., p. 47; t. iv., p. 9.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, it can scarcely admit of doubt that the\r\ndisease is the same as that which Herodotus describes in the following\r\npassage: “Venus inflicted upon the Scythians, who pillaged her temple\r\nat Ascalon, and on their descendants, _the feminine disease_;\r\nat least it is to this cause that they attribute their disease; and\r\ntravellers that go to the land of Scythia see how these persons are\r\naffected whom the Scythians called _accursed_ (ἐναρεες).”[372]\r\n\r\nAll the opinions which have been entertained respecting this affection\r\nare referred by M. Littré to the three following categories:\r\n\r\nI. A vice, namely (A), Pederasty, which, he says is the most ancient\r\nopinion we have respecting it, as indicated by Longinus[373] (on the\r\nSublime, 25), and defended by his commentators, Toll and Pearce, and by\r\nCasaubon and Coster.[374] (B), Onanism, the opinion to which Sprengel\r\ninclines in his work on Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n2. A bodily disease, to wit: (A), Hemorrhoids, as maintained by\r\nPaul Thomas de Girac,[375] by Valkenäer, by Bayer,[376] and by the\r\nCompilers of the ‘Universal History.’[377] (B), A true menstruation,\r\nas appears to be maintained by Lefevre and Dacier,[378] and by others.\r\n(C), Blenorrhagia, as Guy Patin[379] and others suppose. (D), A true\r\nimpotence, as held by Mercuriali and others.\r\n\r\n3. A mental disease, as maintained by Sauvages,[380] Heyne,[381]\r\nCoray,[382] and others.\r\n\r\nM. Rosenbaum is at great pains to make out that the affection in\r\nquestion was pederasty, and that the _accursed_ (ἐνάρεες) of\r\nHerodotus were the same as the _pathici_ of the Romans. I must\r\nsay, that in my opinion Rosenbaum makes out a strong case in support\r\nof this opinion. In particular it will be remarked, that Herodotus\r\nsays, the descendants of these Scythians were also afflicted with this\r\ncomplaint. Now Celsus Aurelianus says expressly, that the affection of\r\nthe pathici was hereditary.[383] Taking everything into account, I must\r\nsay that my own opinion has always been that the disease in question\r\nmust have been some variety of _spermatorrhœa_. I need scarcely\r\nremark that this affection induces a state, both of body and mind,\r\nanalogous to that of the pathici, as described by ancient authors.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, however, I should mention that M. Littré,\r\nin the fourth volume of his Hippocrates (p. xi.), brings into view a\r\nthesis by M. Graff, the object of which is to prove that the disease\r\nof the Scythians was a true sort of impotence; and in illustration of\r\nit, he cites a passage from the memoirs of M. Larrey, containing a\r\ndescription of a species of impotence, attended with wasting of the\r\ntesticle, which attacked the French army in Egypt. But, as far as I can\r\nsee, this disease described by Larrey had nothing to do with riding on\r\nhorseback, and I cannot see any relation between it and the diseases\r\ndescribed by Herodotus and Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nIV. Of all the legendary tales of antiquity, there is probably no\r\none which was so long and so generally credited by the best informed\r\nhistorians, critics, geographers, poets, and philosophers, as the\r\nstory of the Amazons. They are noticed historically by Homer (Iliad,\r\niii., 186; vi., 152); Apollonius Rhodius (ii., 196); Pindar (Olymp.\r\nxiii., 84); Herodotus (ix., 27); Lysias (Epitaph. 3); Plato (Menex.);\r\nIsocrates (Panyg.); Ctesias (Persic.); Plutarch (Theseus); Strabo\r\n(Geogr. ix.); Pausanias (iv., 31, 6; vii., 2, 4); Arrian (Exped.\r\nAlexand.); Quintus Curtius (vi., 4). Now it is singular that in all\r\nthis list of authorities, which, it will be remarked, comprehends\r\nthe _élite_ of ancient scholars, no one, with the exception of\r\nStrabo, ventures to express the slightest doubt respecting the actual\r\nexistence of the Amazons. Some of them, indeed, admit that the race\r\nhad become extinct in their time; but they all seem satisfied that\r\nthe Amazons had truly existed in a bygone age, and consequently they\r\nacknowledge them as real historical personages. See, in particular,\r\nArrian, who, although compelled by his respect for truth to acknowledge\r\nthat they did not exist in the days of Alexander the Great, still does\r\nnot hesitate to declare that it appeared incredible that this race of\r\nwomen, celebrated as they were by the most eminent authors, should\r\nnever have existed at all. Yet, notwithstanding the mass of evidence\r\nin support of their actual existence, I suppose few scholars nowadays\r\nwill hesitate to agree with Heyne (Apollodor. ii., 5, 9), and with\r\nGrote (Hist. of Greece, i., 2), in setting down the whole story as mere\r\nmyth. But, considering how generally it had been believed, we need not\r\nwonder that Hippocrates in this treatise should appear to entertain no\r\ndoubt of their actual existence. The reader will remark that he makes\r\nthe locality of the Amazons to be in Europe, among the Sarmatians,\r\non the north side of the Euxine. It is generally taken for granted,\r\nhowever, in the ancient myths, that their place of residence was on\r\nthe banks of the Thermodon, in Cappadocia, and they are described as\r\nhaving afterwards crossed to the opposite side of the Euxine, when\r\nexpelled from this locality. But, in fact, they are remarkable so\r\nmuch for nothing as their ubiquity, being sometimes located in Asia,\r\nsometimes in Africa, and at other times in Athens. I may remark,\r\nbefore concluding, that Mr. Payne Knight (Symbolical Language, etc.,\r\nClassical Journal, 23), and Creuzer (Symbolik. etc.), give a symbolical\r\ninterpretation to the story of the Amazons; but this mode of explaining\r\nthe myths of antiquity is altogether fanciful and unsatisfactory. It\r\nseems safer and more judicious to deal with them as Mr. Grote has\r\ndone,[384] that is to say, to receive them as tales in which the\r\nancients believed, without having any rational foundation for their\r\nfaith. That there may have been a certain basis of truth in the story\r\nof the Amazons need not be denied; but in this, as in all the ancient\r\nmyths, it is a hopeless task to attempt to separate truth from fiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ON AIRS, WATERS, AND PLACES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Whoever wishes to investigate medicine properly, should proceed\r\nthus: in the first place to consider the seasons of the year, and what\r\neffects each of them produces (for they are not at all alike, but\r\ndiffer much from themselves in regard to their changes).[385] Then\r\nthe winds, the hot and the cold, especially such as are common to all\r\ncountries, and then such as are peculiar to each locality. We must\r\nalso consider the qualities of the waters, for as they differ from\r\none another in taste and weight, so also do they differ much in their\r\nqualities. In the same manner, when one comes into a city to which he\r\nis a stranger, he ought to consider its situation, how it lies as to\r\nthe winds and the rising of the sun; for its influence is not the same\r\nwhether it lies to the north or the south, to the rising or to the\r\nsetting sun. These things one ought to consider most attentively, and\r\nconcerning the waters which the inhabitants use, whether they be marshy\r\nand soft, or hard, and running from elevated and rocky situations, and\r\nthen if saltish and unfit for cooking; and the ground, whether it be\r\nnaked and deficient in water, or wooded and well watered, and whether\r\nit lies in a hollow, confined situation, or is elevated and cold; and\r\nthe mode in which the inhabitants live, and what are their pursuits,\r\nwhether they are fond of drinking and eating to excess, and given to\r\nindolence, or are fond of exercise and labor, and not given to excess\r\nin eating and drinking.[386]\r\n\r\n2. From these things he must proceed to investigate everything else.\r\nFor if one knows all these things well, or at least the greater\r\npart of them, he cannot miss knowing, when he comes into a strange\r\ncity, either the diseases peculiar to the place, or the particular\r\nnature of common diseases, so that he will not be in doubt as to the\r\ntreatment of the diseases, or commit mistakes, as is likely to be the\r\ncase provided one had not previously considered these matters. And\r\nin particular, as the season and the year advances, he can tell what\r\nepidemic diseases will attack the city, either in summer or in winter,\r\nand what each individual will be in danger of experiencing from the\r\nchange of regimen. For knowing the changes of the seasons, the risings\r\nand settings of the stars, how each of them takes place, he will be\r\nable to know beforehand what sort of a year is going to ensue. Having\r\nmade these investigations, and knowing beforehand the seasons, such a\r\none must be acquainted with each particular, and must succeed in the\r\npreservation of health, and be by no means unsuccessful in the practice\r\nof his art. And if it shall be thought that these things belong rather\r\nto meteorology,[387] it will be admitted, on second thoughts, that\r\nastronomy contributes not a little, but a very great deal, indeed, to\r\nmedicine. For with the seasons the digestive organs of men undergo a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n3. But how each of the afore-mentioned things should be investigated\r\nand explained, I will now declare in a clear manner. A city that is\r\nexposed to hot winds (these are between the wintry rising, and the\r\nwintry setting of the sun), and to which these are peculiar, but which\r\nis sheltered from the north winds; in such a city the waters will be\r\nplenteous and saltish, and as they run from an elevated source, they\r\nare necessarily hot in summer, and cold in winter;[388] the heads of\r\nthe inhabitants are of a humid and pituitous constitution, and their\r\nbellies subject to frequent disorders, owing to the phlegm running down\r\nfrom the head; the forms of their bodies, for the most part, are rather\r\nflabby; they do not eat nor drink much; drinking wine in particular,\r\nand more especially if carried to intoxication, is oppressive to them;\r\nand the following diseases are peculiar to the district: in the first\r\nplace, the women are sickly and subject to excessive menstruation; then\r\nmany are unfruitful from disease, and not from nature, and they have\r\nfrequent miscarriages; infants are subject to attacks of convulsions\r\nand asthma, which they consider to be connected with infancy,[389]\r\nand hold to be a sacred disease (epilepsy). The men are subject to\r\nattacks of dysentery, diarrhœa, hepialus,[390] chronic fevers in\r\nwinter, of epinyctis,[391] frequently, and of hemorrhoids about the\r\nanus. Pleurisies, peripneumonies, ardent fevers, and whatever diseases\r\nare reckoned acute, do not often occur, for such diseases are not apt\r\nto prevail where the bowels are loose. Ophthalmies occur of a humid\r\ncharacter, but not of a serious nature, and of short duration, unless\r\nthey attack epidemically from the change of the seasons. And when they\r\npass their fiftieth year, defluxions supervening from the brain, render\r\nthem paralytic when exposed suddenly to strokes of the sun,[392] or\r\nto cold. These diseases are endemic to them, and, moreover, if any\r\nepidemic disease connected with the change of the seasons, prevail,\r\nthey are also liable to it.\r\n\r\n4. But the following is the condition of cities which have the\r\nopposite exposure, namely, to cold winds, between the summer settings\r\nand the summer risings of the sun, and to which these winds are\r\npeculiar, and which are sheltered from the south and the hot breezes.\r\nIn the first place the waters are, for the most part, hard and cold.\r\nThe men must necessarily be well braced and slender, and they must have\r\nthe discharges downwards of the alimentary canal hard, and of difficult\r\nevacuation, while those upwards are more fluid, and rather bilious\r\nthan pituitous. Their heads are sound and hard, and they are liable to\r\nburstings (of vessels?) for the most part. The diseases which prevail\r\nepidemically with them, are pleurisies, and those which are called\r\nacute diseases. This must be the case when the bowels are bound; and\r\nfrom any causes, many become affected with suppurations in the lungs,\r\nthe cause of which is the tension of the body, and hardness of the\r\nbowels; for their dryness and the coldness of the water dispose them\r\nto ruptures (of vessels?). Such constitutions must be given to excess\r\nof eating, but not of drinking; for it is not possible to be gourmands\r\nand drunkards at the same time. Ophthalmies, too, at length supervene;\r\nthese being of a hard and violent nature, and soon ending in rupture\r\nof the eyes; persons under thirty years of age are liable to severe\r\nbleedings at the nose in summer; attacks of epilepsy are rare but\r\nsevere. Such people are likely to be rather long-lived; their ulcers\r\nare not attended with serous discharges, nor of a malignant character;\r\nin disposition they are rather ferocious than gentle. The diseases I\r\nhave mentioned are peculiar to the men, and besides they are liable to\r\nany common complaint which may be prevailing from the changes of the\r\nseasons. But the women, in the first place, are of a hard constitution,\r\nfrom the waters being hard, indigestible, and cold; and their menstrual\r\ndischarges are not regular, but in small quantity, and painful. Then\r\nthey have difficult parturition, but are not very subject to abortions.\r\nAnd when they do bring forth children, they are unable to nurse them;\r\nfor the hardness and indigestible nature of the water puts away their\r\nmilk. Phthisis frequently supervenes after childbirth, for the efforts\r\nof it frequently bring on ruptures and strains.[393] Children while\r\nstill little are subject to dropsies in the testicle, which disappear\r\nas they grow older; in such a town they are late in attaining manhood.\r\nIt is, as I have now stated, with regard to hot and cold winds and\r\ncities thus exposed.\r\n\r\n5. Cities that are exposed to winds between the summer and the winter\r\nrisings of the sun, and those the opposite to them, have the following\r\ncharacters:--Those which lie to the rising of the sun are all likely\r\nto be more healthy than such as are turned to the North, or those\r\nexposed to the hot winds, even if there should not be a furlong\r\nbetween them.[394] In the first place, both the heat and cold are more\r\nmoderate. Then such waters as flow to the rising sun, must necessarily\r\nbe clear, fragrant, soft, and delightful to drink, in such a city. For\r\nthe sun in rising and shining upon them purifies them, by dispelling\r\nthe vapors which generally prevail in the morning. The persons of\r\nthe inhabitants are, for the most part, well colored and blooming,\r\nunless some disease counteract. The inhabitants have clear voices,\r\nand in temper and intellect are superior to those, which are exposed\r\nto the north, and all the productions of the country in like manner\r\nare better. A city so situated resembles the spring as to moderation\r\nbetween heat and cold, and the diseases are few in number, and of a\r\nfeeble kind, and bear a resemblance to the diseases which prevail in\r\nregions exposed to hot winds. The women there are very prolific, and\r\nhave easy deliveries. Thus it is with regard to them.\r\n\r\n6. But such cities as lie to the west, and which are sheltered from\r\nwinds blowing from the east, and which the hot winds and the cold winds\r\nof the north scarcely touch, must necessarily be in a very unhealthy\r\nsituation: in the first place the waters are not clear, the cause of\r\nwhich is, because the mist prevails commonly in the morning, and it is\r\nmixed up with the water and destroys its clearness, for the sun does\r\nnot shine upon the water until he be considerably raised above the\r\nhorizon. And in summer, cold breezes from the east blow and dews fall;\r\nand in the latter part of the day the setting sun particularly scorches\r\nthe inhabitants, and therefore they are pale and enfeebled, and are\r\npartly subject to all the aforesaid diseases, but no one is peculiar to\r\nthem. Their voices are rough and hoarse owing to the state of the air,\r\nwhich in such a situation is generally impure and unwholesome, for they\r\nhave not the northern winds to purify it; and these winds they have\r\nare of a very humid character, such being the nature of the evening\r\nbreezes. Such a situation of a city bears a great resemblance to autumn\r\nas regards the changes of the day, inasmuch as the difference between\r\nmorning and evening is great. So it is with regard to the winds that\r\nare conducive to health, or the contrary.\r\n\r\n7. And I wish to give an account of the other kinds of waters,\r\nnamely, of such as are wholesome and such as are unwholesome, and\r\nwhat bad and what good effects may be derived from water; for water\r\ncontributes much towards health.[395] Such waters then as are marshy,\r\nstagnant, and belong to lakes, are necessarily hot in summer, thick,\r\nand have a strong smell, since they have no current; but being\r\nconstantly supplied by rain-water, and the sun heating them, they\r\nnecessarily want their proper color, are unwholesome and form bile; in\r\nwinter, they become congealed, cold, and muddy with the snow and ice,\r\nso that they are most apt to engender phlegm, and bring on hoarseness;\r\nthose who drink them have large and obstructed spleens, their bellies\r\nare hard, emaciated, and hot; and their shoulders, collar-bones, and\r\nfaces are emaciated; for their flesh is melted down and taken up by the\r\nspleen, and hence they are slender; such persons then are voracious and\r\nthirsty; their bellies are very dry both above and below, so that they\r\nrequire the strongest medicines.[396] This disease is habitual to them\r\nboth in summer and in winter, and in addition they are very subject\r\nto dropsies of a most fatal character; and in summer dysenteries.\r\ndiarrhœas, and protracted quartan fevers frequently seize them, and\r\nthese diseases when prolonged dispose such constitutions to dropsies,\r\nand thus prove fatal. These are the diseases which attack them in\r\nsummer; but in winter younger persons are liable to pneumonia, and\r\nmaniacal affections; and older persons to ardent fevers, from hardness\r\nof the belly. Women are subject to œdema and leucophlegmasiæ;[397]\r\nwhen pregand then during nursing they become wasted and sickly, and\r\nthe lochial discharge after parturition does not proceed properly\r\nwith the women. The children are particularly subject to hernia, and\r\nadults to varices and ulcers on their legs, so that persons with\r\nsuch constitutions cannot be long-lived, but before the usual period\r\nthey fall into a state of premature old age. And further, the women\r\nappear to be with child, and when the time of parturition arrives,\r\nthe fulness of the belly disappears, and this happens from dropsy of\r\nthe uterus.[398] Such waters then I reckon bad for every purpose.\r\nThe next to them in badness are those which have their fountains in\r\nrocks, so that they must necessarily be hard, or come from a soil\r\nwhich produces thermal waters, such as those having iron, copper,\r\nsilver, gold, sulphur, alum, bitumen, or nitre (soda) in them: for\r\nall these are formed by the force of heat.[399] Good waters cannot\r\nproceed from such a soil, but those that are hard and of a heating\r\nnature, difficult to pass by urine, and of difficult evacuation by\r\nthe bowels. The best are those which flow from elevated grounds, and\r\nhills of earth; these are sweet, clear, and can bear a little wine;\r\nthey are hot in summer and cold in winter, for such necessarily must be\r\nthe waters from deep wells. But those are most to be commended which\r\nrun to the rising of the sun, and especially to the summer sun; for\r\nsuch are necessarily more clear, fragrant, and light. But all such as\r\nare saltish, crude, and hard, are not good for drink. But there are\r\ncertain constitutions and diseases with which such waters agree when\r\ndrunk, as I will explain presently. Their characters are as follows:\r\nthe best are such as have their fountains to the east; the next, those\r\nbetween the summer risings and settings of the sun, and especially\r\nthose to the risings; and third, those between the summer and winter\r\nsettings; but the worst are those to the south, and the parts between\r\nthe winter rising and setting, and those to the south are very bad, but\r\nthose to the north are better. They are to be used as follows: whoever\r\nis in good health and strength need not mind, but may always drink\r\nwhatever is at hand. But whoever wishes to drink the most suitable for\r\nany disease, may accomplish his purpose by attending to the following\r\ndirections: To persons whose bellies are hard and easily burnt up, the\r\nsweetest, the lightest, and the most limpid waters will be proper; but\r\nthose persons whose bellies are soft, loose, and pituitous, should\r\nchoose the hardest, those kinds that are most crude, and the saltest,\r\nfor thus will they be most readily dried up; for such waters as are\r\nadapted for boiling, and are of a very solvent nature, naturally loosen\r\nreadily and melt down the bowels; but such as are intractable, hard,\r\nand by no means proper for boiling, these rather bind and dry up the\r\nbowels. People have deceived themselves with regard to salt waters,\r\nfrom inexperience, for they think these waters purgative, whereas they\r\nare the very reverse; for such waters are crude, and ill adapted for\r\nboiling, so that the belly is more likely to be bound up than loosened\r\nby them.[400] And thus it is with regard to the waters of springs.\r\n\r\n8. I will now tell how it is with respect to rain-water, and\r\nwater from snow. Rain waters, then, are the lightest, the sweetest,\r\nthe thinnest, and the clearest; for originally the sun raises and\r\nattracts the thinnest and lightest part of the water, as is obvious\r\nfrom the nature of salts; for the saltish part is left behind owing\r\nto its thickness and weight, and forms salts; but the sun attracts\r\nthe thinnest part, owing to its lightness, and he abstracts this not\r\nonly from the lakes, but also from the sea, and from all things which\r\ncontain humidity, and there is humidity in everything; and from man\r\nhimself the sun draws off the thinnest and lightest part of the juices.\r\nAs a strong proof of this, when a man walks in the sun, or sits down\r\nhaving a garment on, whatever parts of the body the sun shines upon do\r\nnot sweat, for the sun carries off whatever sweat makes its appearance;\r\nbut those parts which are covered by the garment, or anything else,\r\nsweat, for the particles of sweat are drawn and forced out by the\r\nsun, and are preserved by the cover so as not to be dissipated by the\r\nsun; but when the person comes into the shade the whole body equally\r\nperspires, because the sun no longer shines upon it.[401] Wherefore,\r\nof all kinds of water, these spoil the soonest; and rain water has\r\na bad smell, because its particles are collected and mixed together\r\nfrom most objects, so as to spoil the soonest. And in addition to\r\nthis, when attracted and raised up, being carried about and mixed\r\nwith the air, whatever part of it is turbid and darkish is separated\r\nand removed from the other, and becomes cloud and mist, but the most\r\nattenuated and lightest part is left, and becomes sweet, being heated\r\nand concocted by the sun, for all other things when concocted become\r\nsweet. While dissipated then and not in a state of consistence it is\r\ncarried aloft. But when collected and condensed by contrary winds, it\r\nfalls down wherever it happens to be most condensed. For this is likely\r\nto happen when the clouds being carried along and moving with a wind\r\nwhich does not allow them to rest, suddenly encounters another wind and\r\nother clouds from the opposite direction: there it is first condensed,\r\nand what is behind is carried up to the spot, and thus it thickens,\r\nblackens, and is conglomerated, and by its weight it falls down and\r\nbecomes rain. Such, to all appearance, are the best of waters, but they\r\nrequire to be boiled and strained;[402] for otherwise they have a bad\r\nsmell, and occasion hoarseness and thickness of the voice to those who\r\ndrink them.[403] Those from snow and ice are all bad, for when once\r\ncongealed, they never again recover their former nature; for whatever\r\nis clear, light, and sweet in them, is separated and disappears; but\r\nthe most turbid and weightiest part is left behind.[404] You may\r\nascertain this in the following manner: If in winter you will pour\r\nwater by measure into a vessel and expose it to the open air until\r\nit is all frozen, and then on the following day bring it into a warm\r\nsituation where the ice will thaw, if you will measure the water\r\nagain when dissolved you will find it much less in quantity. This is\r\na proof that the lightest and thinnest part is dissipated and dried\r\nup by the congelation, and not the heaviest and thickest, for that is\r\nimpossible:[405] wherefore I hold that waters from snow and ice, and\r\nthose allied to them, are the worst of any for all purposes whatever.\r\nSuch are the characters of rain-water, and those from ice and snow.\r\n\r\n9.[406] Men become affected with the stone, and are seized with\r\ndiseases of the kidneys, strangury, sciatica, and become ruptured,\r\nwhen they drink all sorts of waters, and those from great rivers into\r\nwhich other rivulets run, or from a lake into which many streams of\r\nall sorts flow, and such as are brought from a considerable distance.\r\nFor it is impossible that such waters can resemble one another, but\r\none kind is sweet, another saltish and aluminous, and some flow from\r\nthermal springs; and these being all mixed up together disagree, and\r\nthe strongest part always prevails; but the same kind is not always\r\nthe strongest, but sometimes one and sometimes another, according to\r\nthe winds, for the north wind imparts strength to this water, and\r\nthe south to that, and so also with regard to the others. There must\r\nbe deposits of mud and sand in the vessels from such waters, and the\r\naforesaid diseases must be engendered by them when drunk, but why not\r\nto all I will now explain. When the bowels are loose and in a healthy\r\nstate,[407] and when the bladder is not hot, nor the neck of the\r\nbladder very contracted, all such persons pass water freely, and no\r\nconcretion forms in the bladder; but those in whom the belly is hot,\r\nthe bladder must be in the same condition; and when preternaturally\r\nheated, its neck becomes inflamed; and when these things happen, the\r\nbladder does not expel the urine, but raises its heat excessively. And\r\nthe thinnest part of it is secreted, and the purest part is passed\r\noff in the form of urine, but the thickest and most turbid part is\r\ncondensed and concreted, at first in small quantity, but afterwards\r\nin greater; for being rolled about in the urine, whatever is of a\r\nthick consistence it assimilates to itself, and thus it increases and\r\nbecomes indurated. And when such persons make water, the stone forced\r\ndown by the urine falls into the neck of the bladder and stops the\r\nurine, and occasions intense pain; so that calculous children rub their\r\nprivy parts and tear at them, as supposing that the obstruction to\r\nthe urine is situated there. As a proof that it is as I say, persons\r\naffected with calculus have very limpid urine, because the thickest\r\nand foulest part remains and is concreted.[408] Thus it generally is\r\nin cases of calculus. It forms also in children from milk, when it is\r\nnot wholesome, but very hot and bilious, for it heats the bowels and\r\nbladder, so that the urine being also heated undergoes the same change.\r\nAnd I hold that it is better to give children only the most diluted\r\nwine, for such will least burn up and dry the veins. Calculi do not\r\nform so readily in women, for in them the urethra is short and wide,\r\nso that in them the urine is easily expelled; neither do they rub the\r\npudendum with their hands, nor handle the passage like males;[409] for\r\nthe urethra in women opens direct into the pudendum, which is not the\r\ncase with men, neither in them is the urethra so wide, and they drink\r\nmore than children do.[410] Thus, or nearly so, is it with reward to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n10. And respecting the seasons, one may judge whether the year will\r\nprove sickly or healthy from the following observations:[411]--If\r\nthe appearances connected with the rising and setting stars be as\r\nthey should be; if there be rains in autumn; if the winter be mild,\r\nneither very tepid nor unseasonably cold, and if in spring the rains be\r\nseasonable, and so also in summer, the year is likely to prove healthy.\r\nBut if the winter be dry and northerly, and the spring showery and\r\nsoutherly, the summer will necessarily be of a febrile character, and\r\ngive rise to ophthalmies and dysenteries.[412] For when suffocating\r\nheat sets in all of a sudden, while the earth is moistened by the\r\nvernal showers, and by the south wind, the heat is necessarily doubled\r\nfrom the earth, which is thus soaked by rain and heated by a burning\r\nsun, while, at the same time, men’s bellies are not in an orderly\r\nstate, nor the brain properly dried; for it is impossible, after such\r\na spring, but that the body and its flesh must be loaded with humors,\r\nso that very acute fevers will attack all, but especially those of a\r\nphlegmatic constitution. Dysenteries are also likely to occur to women\r\nand those of a very humid temperament. And if at the rising of the\r\nDog-star rain and wintry storms supervene, and if the etesian winds\r\nblow, there is reason to hope that these diseases will cease, and that\r\nthe autumn will be healthy; but if not, it is likely to be a fatal\r\nseason to children and women, but least of all to old men; and that\r\nconvalescents will pass into quartans, and from quartans into dropsies;\r\nbut if the winter be southerly, showery and mild, but the spring\r\nnortherly, dry, and of a wintry character, in the first place women\r\nwho happen to be with child, and whose accouchement should take place\r\nin spring, are apt to miscarry; and such as bring forth, have feeble\r\nand sickly children, so that they either die presently or are tender,\r\nfeeble, and sickly, if they live. Such is the case with the women.\r\nThe others are subject to dysenteries[413] and dry ophthalmies, and\r\nsome have catarrhs beginning in the head and descending to the lungs.\r\nMen of a phlegmatic temperament are likely to have dysenteries; and\r\nwomen, also, from the humidity of their nature, the phlegm descending\r\ndownwards from the brain; those who are bilious, too, have dry\r\nophthalmies from the heat and dryness of their flesh; the aged, too,\r\nhave catarrhs from their flabbiness and melting of the veins, so that\r\nsome of them die suddenly and some become paralytic on the right side\r\nor the left.[414] For when, the winter being southerly and the body\r\nhot, the blood and veins are not properly constringed; a spring that\r\nis northerly, dry, and cold, having come on, the brain when it should\r\nhave been expanded and purged, by the coryza and hoarseness is then\r\nconstringed and contracted, so that the summer and the heat occurring\r\nsuddenly, and a change supervening, these diseases fall out. And such\r\ncities as lie well to the sun and winds, and use good waters, feel\r\nthese changes less, but such as use marshy and pooly waters, and lie\r\nwell both as regards the winds and the sun, these all feel it more. And\r\nif the summer be dry, those diseases soon cease, but if rainy, they\r\nare protracted; and there is danger of any sore that there is becoming\r\nphagedenic from any cause; and lienteries and dropsies supervene at\r\nthe conclusion of diseases; for the bowels are not readily dried up.\r\nAnd if the summer be rainy and southerly, and next the autumn, the\r\nwinter must, of necessity, be sickly, and ardent fevers are likely to\r\nattack those that are phlegmatic, and more elderly than forty years,\r\nand pleurisies and peripneumonies[415] those that are bilious. But\r\nif the summer is parched and northerly, but the autumn rainy and\r\nsoutherly, headache and sphacelus of the brain[416] are likely to\r\noccur; and in addition hoarseness, coryza, coughs, and in some cases,\r\nconsumption.[417] But if the season is northerly and without water,\r\nthere being no rain, neither after the Dog-star nor Arcturus; this\r\nstate agrees best with those who are naturally phlegmatic, with those\r\nwho are of a humid temperament, and with women: but it is most inimical\r\nto the bilious; for they become much parched up, and ophthalmies of a\r\ndry nature supervene, fevers both acute and chronic, and in some cases\r\nmelancholy;[418] for the most humid and watery part of the bile being\r\nconsumed, the thickest and most acrid portion is left, and of the blood\r\nlikewise, whence these diseases come upon them. But all these are\r\nbeneficial to the phlegmatic, for they are thereby dried up, and reach\r\nwinter not oppressed with humors, but with them dried up.\r\n\r\n11. Whoever studies and observes these things may be able to foresee\r\nmost of the effects which will result from the changes of the seasons:\r\nand one ought to be particularly guarded during the greatest changes\r\nof the seasons, and neither willingly give medicines, nor apply the\r\ncautery to the belly, nor make incisions there until ten or more days\r\nbe past. Now, the greatest and most dangerous are the two solstices,\r\nand especially the summer, and also the two equinoxes, but especially\r\nthe autumnal.[419] One ought also to be guarded about the rising of\r\nthe stars, especially of the Dog-star, then of Arcturus, and then the\r\nsetting of the Pleiades; for diseases are especially apt to prove\r\ncritical in those days, and some prove fatal, some pass off, and all\r\nothers change to another form and another constitution. So it is with\r\nregard to them.\r\n\r\n12. I wish to show, respecting Asia and Europe, how, in all respects,\r\nthey differ from one another, and concerning the figure of the\r\ninhabitants, for they are different, and do not at all resemble one\r\nanother. To treat of all would be a long story, but I will tell you how\r\nI think it is with regard to the greatest and most marked differences.\r\nI say, then, that Asia differs very much from Europe as to the nature\r\nof all things, both with regard to the productions of the earth and\r\nthe inhabitants, for everything is produced much more beautiful and\r\nlarge in Asia; the country is milder, and the dispositions of the\r\ninhabitants also are more gentle and affectionate.[420] The cause of\r\nthis is the temperature of the seasons, because it lies in the middle\r\nof the risings of the sun[421] towards the east, and removed from the\r\ncold (and heat),[422] for nothing tends to growth and mildness so much\r\nas when the climate has no predominant quality, but a general equality\r\nof temperature prevails. It is not everywhere the same with regard\r\nto Asia, but such parts of the country as lie intermediate between\r\nthe heat and the cold, are the best supplied with fruits and trees,\r\nand have the most genial climate, and enjoy the purest waters, both\r\ncelestial and terrestrial. For neither are they much burnt up by the\r\nheat, nor dried up by the drought and want of rain, nor do they suffer\r\nfrom the cold; since they are well watered from abundant showers and\r\nsnow, and the fruits of the season,[423] as might be supposed, grow\r\nin abundance, both such as are raised from seed that has been sown,\r\nand such plants as the earth produces of its own accord, the fruits\r\nof which the inhabitants make use of, training them from their wild\r\nstate and transplanting them to a suitable soil; the cattle also which\r\nare reared there are vigorous, particularly prolific, and bring up\r\nyoung of the fairest description; the inhabitants too, are well fed,\r\nmost beautiful in shape, of large stature, and differ little from one\r\nanother either as to figure or size; and the country itself, both as\r\nregards its constitution and mildness of the seasons, may be said to\r\nbear a close resemblance to the spring. Manly courage, endurance of\r\nsuffering, laborious enterprise, and high spirit, could not be produced\r\nin such a state of things either among the native inhabitants or those\r\nof a different country, for there pleasure necessarily reigns. For this\r\nreason, also, the forms of wild beasts there are much varied.[424] Thus\r\nit is, as I think, with the Egyptians and Libyans.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. But concerning those on the right hand of the summer risings of\r\nthe sun as far as the Palus Mæotis[425] (for this is the boundary of\r\nEurope and Asia), it is with them as follows: the inhabitants there\r\ndiffer far more from one another than those I have treated of above,\r\nowing to the differences of the seasons and the nature of the soil. But\r\nwith regard to the country itself, matters are the same there as among\r\nall other men; for where the seasons undergo the greatest and most\r\nrapid changes, there the country is the wildest and most unequal; and\r\nyou will find the greatest variety of mountains, forests, plains, and\r\nmeadows; but where the seasons do not change much there the country is\r\nthe most even; and, if one will consider it, so is it also with regard\r\nto the inhabitants; for the nature of some is like to a country covered\r\nwith trees and well watered; of some, to a thin soil deficient in\r\nwater; of others, to fenny and marshy places; and of some again, to a\r\nplain of bare and parched land.[426] For the seasons which modify their\r\nnatural frame of body are varied, and the greater the varieties of them\r\nthe greater also will be the differences of their shapes.\r\n\r\n14. I will pass over the smaller differences among the nations, but\r\nwill now treat of such as are great either from nature, or custom; and,\r\nfirst, concerning the Macrocephali.[427] There is no other race of\r\nmen which have heads in the least resembling theirs. At first, usage\r\nwas the principal cause of the length of their head, but now nature\r\ncooperates with usage. They think those the most noble who have the\r\nlongest heads. It is thus with regard to the usage: immediately after\r\nthe child is born, and while its head is still tender, they fashion\r\nit with their hands, and constrain it to assume a lengthened shape by\r\napplying bandages and other suitable contrivances whereby the spherical\r\nform of the head is destroyed, and it is made to increase in length.\r\nThus, at first, usage operated, so that this constitution was the\r\nresult of force: but, in the course of time, it was formed naturally;\r\nso that usage had nothing to do with it; for the semen comes from all\r\nparts of the body, sound from the sound parts, and unhealthy from the\r\nunhealthy parts. If, then, children with bald heads are born to parents\r\nwith bald heads; and children with blue eyes to parents who have blue\r\neyes; and if the children of parents having distorted eyes squint also\r\nfor the most part; and if the same may be said of other forms of the\r\nbody, what is to prevent it from happening that a child with a long\r\nhead should be produced by a parent having a long head?[428] But now\r\nthese things do not happen as they did formerly, for the custom no\r\nlonger prevails owing to their intercourse with other men. Thus it\r\nappears to me to be with regard to them.\r\n\r\n15. As to the inhabitants of Phasis,[429] their country is fenny,\r\nwarm, humid, and wooded; copious and severe rains occur there at all\r\nseasons; and the life of the inhabitants is spent among the fens; for\r\ntheir dwellings are constructed of wood and reeds, and are erected\r\namidst the waters; they seldom practise walking either to the city or\r\nthe market, but sail about, up and down, in canoes constructed out of\r\nsingle trees, for there are many canals there.[430] They drink the\r\nhot and stagnant waters, both when rendered putrid by the sun, and\r\nwhen swollen with rains. The Phasis itself is the most stagnant of\r\nall rivers, and runs the smoothest;[431] all the fruits which spring\r\nthere are unwholesome, of feeble and imperfect growth, owing to the\r\nredundance of water, and on this account they do not ripen, for much\r\nvapor from the waters overspreads the country. For these reasons the\r\nPhasians have shapes different from those of all other men; for they\r\nare large in stature, and of a very gross habit of body, so that not\r\na joint nor vein is visible; in color they are sallow, as if affected\r\nwith jaundice. Of all men they have the roughest voices, from their\r\nbreathing an atmosphere which is not clear, but misty and humid; they\r\nare naturally rather languid in supporting bodily fatigue. The seasons\r\nundergo but little change either as to heat or cold; their winds for\r\nthe most part are southerly, with the exception of one peculiar to\r\nthe country, which sometimes blows strong, is violent and hot, and\r\nis called by them the wind _cenchron_. The north wind scarcely\r\nreaches them, and when it does blow it is weak and gentle. Thus it is\r\nwith regard to the different nature and shape of the inhabitants of\r\nAsia and Europe.\r\n\r\n16. And with regard to the pusillanimity and cowardice of the\r\ninhabitants, the principal reason why the Asiatics are more unwarlike\r\nand of more gentle disposition than the Europeans is, the nature of the\r\nseasons, which do not undergo any great changes either to heat or cold,\r\nor the like; for there is neither excitement of the understanding nor\r\nany strong change of the body by which the temper might be ruffled, and\r\nthey be roused to inconsiderate emotion and passion, rather than living\r\nas they do always in the same state. It is changes of all kinds which\r\narouse the understanding of mankind, and do not allow them to get into\r\na torpid condition. For these reasons, it appears to me, the Asiatic\r\nrace is feeble, and further, owing to their laws; for monarchy prevails\r\nin the greater part of Asia, and where men are not their own masters\r\nnor independent, but are the slaves of others, it is not a matter of\r\nconsideration with them how they may acquire military discipline, but\r\nhow they may seem not to be warlike, for the dangers are not equally\r\nshared, since they must serve as soldiers, perhaps endure fatigue,\r\nand die for their masters, far from their children, their wives, and\r\nother friends; and whatever noble and manly actions they may perform\r\nlead only to the aggrandizement of their masters, whilst the fruits\r\nwhich they reap are dangers and death; and, in addition to all this,\r\nthe lands of such persons must be laid waste by the enemy and want\r\nof culture.[432] Thus, then, if any one be naturally warlike and\r\ncourageous, his disposition will be changed by the institutions. As a\r\nstrong proof of all this, such Greeks or barbarians in Asia as are not\r\nunder a despotic form of government, but are independent, and enjoy\r\nthe fruits of their own labors, are of all others the most warlike;\r\nfor these encounter dangers on their own account, bear the prizes of\r\ntheir own valor, and in like manner endure the punishment of their own\r\ncowardice. And you will find the Asiatics differing from one another,\r\nfor some are better and others more dastardly; of these differences, as\r\nI stated before, the changes of the seasons are the cause. Thus it is\r\nwith Asia.\r\n\r\n17. In Europe there is a Scythian race, called Sauromatæ, which\r\ninhabits the confines of the Palus Mæotis, and is different from all\r\nother races.[433] Their women mount on horseback, use the bow, and\r\nthrow the javelin from their horses, and fight with their enemies as\r\nlong as they are virgins; and they do not lay aside their virginity\r\nuntil they kill three of their enemies, nor have any connection with\r\nmen until they perform the sacrifices according to law. Whoever takes\r\nto herself a husband, gives up riding on horseback unless the necessity\r\nof a general expedition obliges her. They have no right breast; for\r\nwhile still of a tender age their mothers heat strongly a copper\r\ninstrument constructed for this very purpose, and apply it to the right\r\nbreast, which is burnt up, and its development being arrested, all the\r\nstrength and fullness are determined to the right shoulder and arm.\r\n\r\n18. As the other Scythians have a peculiarity of shape, and do not\r\nresemble any other, the same observation applies to the Egyptians, only\r\nthat the latter are oppressed by heat and the former by cold.[434]\r\nWhat is called the Scythian desert is a prairie, abounding in meadows,\r\nhigh-lying, and well watered; for the rivers which carry off the water\r\nfrom the plains are large. There live those Scythians which are called\r\nNomades, because they have no houses, but live in wagons. The smallest\r\nof these wagons have four wheels, but some have six; they are covered\r\nin with felt, and they are constructed in the manner of houses, some\r\nhaving but a single apartment, and some three; they are proof against\r\nrain, snow, and winds. The wagons are drawn by yokes of oxen, some of\r\ntwo and others of three, and all without horns, for they have no horns,\r\nowing to the cold.[435] In these wagons the women live, but the men\r\nare carried about on horses, and the sheep, oxen, and horses accompany\r\nthem; and they remain on any spot as long as there is provender for\r\ntheir cattle, and when that fails they migrate to some other place.\r\nThey eat boiled meat, and drink the milk of mares, and also eat\r\n_hippace_, which is cheese prepared from the milk of the mare.\r\nSuch is their mode of life and their customs.[436]\r\n\r\n19. In respect of the seasons and figure of body, the Scythian race,\r\nlike the Egyptian, have a uniformity of resemblance, different from\r\nall other nations; they are by no means prolific, and the wild beasts\r\nwhich are indigenous there are small in size and few in number, for\r\nthe country lies under the Northern Bears, and the Rhiphæan mountains,\r\nwhence the north wind blows; the sun comes very near to them only when\r\nin the summer solstice, and warms them but for a short period, and not\r\nstrongly; and the winds blowing from the hot regions of the earth do\r\nnot reach them, or but seldom, and with little force; but the winds\r\nfrom the north always blow, congealed, as they are, by the snow, the\r\nice, and much water, for these never leave the mountains, which are\r\nthereby rendered uninhabitable. A thick fog covers the plains during\r\nthe day, and amidst it they live, so that winter may be said to be\r\nalways present with them; or, if they have summer, it is only for a\r\nfew days, and the heat is not very strong. Their plains are high-lying\r\nand naked, not crowned with mountains, but extending upwards under\r\nthe Northern Bears.[437] The wild beasts there are not large, but\r\nsuch as can be sheltered under-ground; for the cold of winter and the\r\nbarrenness of the country prevent their growth, and because they have\r\nno covert nor shelter.[438] The changes of the seasons, too, are not\r\ngreat nor violent, for, in fact, they change gradually; and therefore\r\ntheir figures resemble one another, as they all equally use the same\r\nfood, and the same clothing summer and winter, respiring a humid and\r\ndense atmosphere, and drinking water from snow and ice; neither do they\r\nmake any laborious exertions, for neither body nor mind is capable of\r\nenduring fatigue when the changes of the seasons are not great.[439]\r\nFor these reasons their shapes are gross and fleshy, with ill-marked\r\njoints, of a humid temperament, and deficient in tone: the internal\r\ncavities, and especially those of the intestines, are full of humors;\r\nfor the belly cannot possibly be dry in such a country, with such a\r\nconstitution and in such a climate; but owing to their fat, and the\r\nabsence of hairs from their bodies, their shapes resemble one another,\r\nthe males being all alike, and so also with the women: for the seasons\r\nbeing of an uniform temperature, no corruption or deterioration takes\r\nplace in the concretion of the semen, unless from some violent cause,\r\nor from disease.[440]\r\n\r\n20. I will give you a strong proof of the humidity (laxity?) of their\r\nconstitutions.[441] You will find the greater part of the Scythians,\r\nand all the Nomades, with marks of the cautery on their shoulders,\r\narms, wrists, breasts, hip-joints, and loins, and that for no other\r\nreason but the humidity and flabbiness of their constitution, for they\r\ncan neither strain with their bows, nor launch the javelin from their\r\nshoulder owing to their humidity and atony: but when they are burnt,\r\nmuch of the humidity in their joints is dried up, and they become\r\nbetter braced, better fed, and their joints get into a more suitable\r\ncondition.[442] They are flabby and squat at first, because, as in\r\nEgypt, they are not swathed(?);[443] and then they pay no attention to\r\nhorsemanship, so that they may be adepts at it; and because of their\r\nsedentary mode of life; for the males, when they cannot be carried\r\nabout on horseback, sit the most of their time in the wagon, and rarely\r\npractise walking, because of their frequent migrations and shiftings of\r\nsituation; and as to the women, it is amazing how flabby and sluggish\r\nthey are. The Scythian race are tawny from the cold, and not from the\r\nintense heat of the sun, for the whiteness of the skin is parched by\r\nthe cold, and becomes tawny.\r\n\r\n21. It is impossible that persons of such a constitution could be\r\nprolific, for, with the man, the sexual desires are not strong, owing\r\nto the laxity of his constitution, the softness and coldness of his\r\nbelly, from all which causes it is little likely that a man should\r\nbe given to venery; and besides, from being jaded by exercise on\r\nhorseback, the men become weak in their desires. On the part of the men\r\nthese are the causes; but on that of the women, they are embonpoint and\r\nhumidity; for the womb cannot take in the semen, nor is the menstrual\r\ndischarge such as it should be, but scanty and at too long intervals;\r\nand the mouth of the womb is shut up by fat and does not admit the\r\nsemen; and, moreover, they themselves are indolent and fat, and their\r\nbellies cold and soft.[444] From these causes the Scythian race is not\r\nprolific. Their female servants furnish a strong proof of this; for\r\nthey no sooner have connection with a man than they prove with child,\r\nowing to their active course of life and the slenderness of body.\r\n\r\n22. And, in addition to these, there are many eunuchs among the\r\nScythians, who perform female work, and speak like women. Such persons\r\nare called effeminates.[445] The inhabitants of the country attribute\r\nthe cause of their impotence to a god, and venerate and worship such\r\npersons, every one dreading that the like might befall himself; but\r\nto me it appears that such affections are just as much divine as all\r\nothers are, and that no one disease is either more divine or more human\r\nthan another, but that all are alike divine, for that each has its own\r\nnature, and that no one arises without a natural cause.[446] But I will\r\nexplain how I think that the affection takes its rise. From continued\r\nexercise on horseback they are seized with chronic defluxions in\r\ntheir joints (_kedmata_[447]) owing to their legs always hanging\r\ndown below their horses; they afterwards become lame and stiff at the\r\nhip-joint, such of them, at least, as are severely attacked with it.\r\nThey treat themselves in this way: when the disease is commencing,\r\nthey open the vein behind either ear, and when the blood flows, sleep,\r\nfrom feebleness, seizes them, and afterwards they awaken, some in good\r\nhealth and others not. To me it appears that the semen is altered by\r\nthis treatment, for there are veins behind the ears which, if cut,\r\ninduce impotence; now, these veins would appear to me to be cut.[448]\r\nSuch persons afterwards, when they go in to women and cannot have\r\nconnection with them, at first do not think much about it, but remain\r\nquiet; but when, after making the attempt two, three, or more times,\r\nthey succeed no better, fancying they have committed some offence\r\nagainst the god whom they blame for the affection, they put on female\r\nattire, reproach themselves for effeminacy, play the part of women, and\r\nperform the same work as women do. This the rich among the Scythians\r\nendure, not the basest, but the most noble and powerful, owing to\r\ntheir riding on horseback; for the poor are less affected, as they\r\ndo not ride on horses. And yet, if this disease had been more divine\r\nthan the others, it ought not to have befallen the most noble and the\r\nrichest of the Scythians alone, but all alike, or rather those who have\r\nlittle, as not being able to pay honors to the gods, if, indeed, they\r\ndelight in being thus rewarded by men, and grant favors in return; for\r\nit is likely that the rich sacrifice more to the gods, and dedicate\r\nmore votive offerings, inasmuch as they have wealth, and worship the\r\ngods; whereas the poor, from want, do less in this way, and, moreover,\r\nupbraid the gods for not giving them wealth, so that those who have few\r\npossessions were more likely to bear the punishments of these offences\r\nthan the rich. But, as I formerly said, these affections are divine\r\njust as much as others, for each springs from a natural cause, and this\r\ndisease arises among the Scythians from such a cause as I have stated.\r\nBut it attacks other men in like manner, for whenever men ride much\r\nand very frequently on horseback, then many are affected with rheums\r\nin the joints, sciatica, and gout, and they are inept at venery. But\r\nthese complaints befall the Scythian, and they are the most impotent of\r\nmen for the aforesaid causes, and because they always wear breeches,\r\nand spend the most of their time on horseback,[449] so as not to touch\r\ntheir privy parts with the hand, and from the cold and fatigue they\r\nforget the sexual desire, and do not make the attempt until after\r\nthey have lost their virility.[450] Thus it is with the race of the\r\nScythians.\r\n\r\n23. The other races in Europe differ from one another, both as to\r\nstature and shape, owing to the changes of the seasons, which are very\r\ngreat and frequent, and because the heat is strong, the winters severe,\r\nand there are frequent rains, and again protracted droughts, and winds,\r\nfrom which many and diversified changes are induced. These changes are\r\nlikely to have an effect upon generation in the coagulation of the\r\nsemen, as this process cannot be the same in summer as in winter, nor\r\nin rainy as in dry weather; wherefore, I think, that the figures of\r\nEuropeans differ more than those of Asiatics; and they differ very much\r\nfrom one another as to stature in the same city; for vitiations of the\r\nsemen occur in its coagulation more frequently during frequent changes\r\nof the seasons, than where they are alike and equable. And the same may\r\nbe said of their dispositions, for the wild, and unsociable, and the\r\npassionate occur in such a constitution; for frequent excitement of\r\nthe mind induces wildness, and extinguishes sociableness and mildness\r\nof disposition, and therefore I think the inhabitants of Europe more\r\ncourageous than those of Asia; for a climate which is always the same\r\ninduces indolence, but a changeable climate, laborious exertions both\r\nof body and mind; and from rest and indolence cowardice is engendered,\r\nand from laborious exertions and pains, courage. On this account the\r\ninhabitants of Europe are more warlike than the Asiatics, and also\r\nowing to their institutions, because they are not governed by kings\r\nlike the latter, for where men are governed by kings there they must be\r\nvery cowardly, as I have stated before; for their souls are enslaved,\r\nand they will not willingly, or readily undergo dangers in order to\r\npromote the power of another; but those that are free undertake dangers\r\non their own account, and not for the sake of others; they court hazard\r\nand go out to meet it, for they themselves bear off the rewards of\r\nvictory, and thus their institutions contribute not a little to their\r\ncourage.[451]\r\n\r\nSuch is the general character of Europe and Asia.[452]\r\n\r\n24. And there are in Europe other tribes, differing from one\r\nanother in stature, shape, and courage: the differences are those I\r\nformerly mentioned, and will now explain more clearly. Such as inhabit\r\na country which is mountainous, rugged, elevated, and well watered,\r\nand where the changes of the seasons are very great, are likely to\r\nhave great variety of shapes among them, and to be naturally of an\r\nenterprising and warlike disposition;[453] and such persons are apt\r\nto have no little of the savage and ferocious in their nature; but\r\nsuch as dwell in places which are low-lying, abounding in meadows\r\nand ill ventilated, and who have a larger proportion of hot than of\r\ncold winds, and who make use of warm waters--these are not likely to\r\nbe of large stature nor well proportioned, but are of a broad make,\r\nfleshy, and have black hair; and they are rather of a dark than of a\r\nlight complexion, and are less likely to be phlegmatic than bilious;\r\ncourage and laborious enterprise are not naturally in them, but may\r\nbe engendered in them by means of their institutions. And if there\r\nbe rivers in the country which carry off the stagnant and rain water\r\nfrom it, these may be wholesome and clear; but if there be no rivers,\r\nbut the inhabitants drink the waters of fountains, and such as are\r\nstagnant and marshy, they must necessarily have prominent bellies and\r\nenlarged spleens. But such as inhabit a high country, and one that is\r\nlevel, windy, and well-watered, will be large of stature, and like to\r\none another; but their minds will be rather unmanly and gentle. Those\r\nwho live on thin, ill-watered, and bare soils, and not well attempered\r\nin the changes of the seasons, in such a country they are likely to\r\nbe in their persons rather hard and well braced, rather of a blond\r\nthan a dark complexion, and in disposition and passions haughty and\r\nself-willed. For, where the changes of the seasons are most frequent,\r\nand where they differ most from one another, there you will find\r\ntheir forms, dispositions, and nature the most varied. These are the\r\nstrongest of the natural causes of difference, and next the country in\r\nwhich one lives, and the waters; for, in general, you will find the\r\nforms and dispositions of mankind to correspond with the nature of the\r\ncountry; for where the land is fertile, soft, and well-watered, and\r\nsupplied with waters from very elevated situations, so as to be hot\r\nin summer and cold in winter, and where the seasons are fine, there\r\nthe men are fleshy, have ill-formed joints,[454] and are of a humid\r\ntemperament; they are not disposed to endure labor, and, for the most\r\npart, are base in spirit; indolence and sluggishness are visible in\r\nthem, and to the arts they are dull, and not clever nor acute. When\r\nthe country is bare, not fenced, and rugged, blasted by the winter and\r\nscorched by the sun, there you may see the men hardy, slender, with\r\nwell-shaped joints,[454] well-braced, and shaggy; sharp industry and\r\nvigilance accompany such a constitution; in morals and passions they\r\nare haughty and opinionative, inclining rather to the fierce than to\r\nthe mild; and you will find them acute and ingenious as regards the\r\narts, and excelling in military affairs; and likewise all the other\r\nproductions of the earth corresponding to the earth itself.[455] Thus\r\nit is with regard to the most opposite natures and shapes; drawing\r\nconclusions from them, you may judge of the rest without any risk of\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ON THE PROGNOSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nOf the genuineness of this work I have treated in the Preliminary\r\nDiscourse, and have also briefly touched upon its relation to two other\r\nimportant treatises in the Hippocratic collection, the “Prorrhetics”\r\nand the “Coacæ Prænotiones.” The latter subject I am now to resume,\r\nand in doing so I mean to avail myself of the talented dissertation of\r\nDr. Ermerins, to which also I have already made allusion. Indeed I am\r\npersuaded that I cannot do a more acceptable service to my profession\r\nin Britain than by laying before them a brief exposition of the\r\nimportant views brought forward in this “Dissertatio Inauguralis.”[456]\r\n\r\nAfter some preliminary observations on the ancient Temples of Health,\r\nwhich are mainly derived from Sprengel’s “History of Medicine”[457]\r\nhe passes on to consider the opinion stated by this author and others\r\nbefore his time, that the first book of the “Prorrhetics” and the\r\n“Coacæ Prænotiones” are the results of isolated observations made upon\r\nthe sick in the Asclepion of Cos. The probability of this opinion\r\nbeing well founded he shows to be very great; and he next endeavors\r\nto solve the question whether the first book of the “Prorrhetics”\r\nbe derived from the “Coacæ Prænotiones,” or whether the latter be\r\nthe more modern work of the two. He comes to the conclusion that the\r\n“Prorrhetics” is the more ancient work, for the following reasons: 1st.\r\nBecause in it the names of the patients are frequently given, which\r\nis rarely the case in the “Coacæ Prænotiones.” 2d. Because queries\r\nand doubts are oftener found in this book than in the other, when one\r\ntakes into account the number of presages. 3d. Because the number\r\nof observations which this book contains is much smaller than those\r\nwhich the “Coacæ” embrace. 4th. This is confirmed by the circumstance\r\nthat the enunciations of the prognoses are far less extended in the\r\n“Prorrhetics,” whence it is clearly proved that they are not derived\r\nfrom so great a field of observations as those we meet with in the\r\nother work. He then gives a most lucid view of the parallelism which\r\nsubsists between the “Prorrhetica” and the “Coacæ,” and, as the results\r\nof his observations upon them, he draws the following most important\r\nconclusions:\r\n\r\n1. “By a most fortunate occurrence certain monuments of the medical\r\nart, as cultivated by the Asclepiadæ, are preserved to us in the first\r\n“Prorrhetics” and the “Prænotiones Coacæ” which books appear to be\r\nfragments and excerpts from the histories of diseases and cures which\r\nwere formerly found on the votive tablets of the Coan temple.\r\n\r\n2. This sacerdotal medicine was at first a certain medical divination,\r\nwhich, as it was the offspring of pure observation, so the system of\r\nprognostics of the Coans was altogether aloof from the theories and\r\nsystems of the philosophers, and is therefore to be reckoned most\r\nworthy of our attention, both from the great love of observation which\r\nwe admire in it, and from the exquisite and beautiful sense of the\r\nsimple truth which it evinces.\r\n\r\n3. We must keep in view the origin of these presages from individual\r\nobservations gradually collected, in order that we may have a knowledge\r\nof this system of prognostic semeiology. Hence we comprehend how we\r\nmeet with so many doubtful propositions, and so many uncertain and\r\nvague remarks, and that imperfect etiology which confounded causes with\r\ntheir effects, and again, the latter with the former.\r\n\r\n4. The readers must particularly keep before their eyes this origin,\r\nand the antiquity of those writings, if they would pass a correct\r\njudgment on the merits of the Asclepiadæ towards the art of medicine.\r\nWhatever in their works we have the pleasure of possessing, all attest\r\nthe infancy of the art; many things are imperfect, and not unfrequently\r\ndo we see them, while in the pursuit of truth, groping, as it were, and\r\nproceeding with uncertain steps, like men wandering about in darkness;\r\nbut yet the method which they applied, and to which they would seem to\r\nhave betaken themselves of their own accord, was so excellent, that\r\nnothing could surpass it. It was the same method which Hippocrates\r\nhimself always adopted, and which, in fine, Lord Bacon, many ages\r\nafterwards, commended as the only instrument by which truth in medicine\r\ncan be found out.\r\n\r\n5. As this method is founded on true induction, so are its dicta to be\r\nheld the more worthy of admiration, the more they possess a universal\r\nsignification. To give an example; what assiduous observation, and\r\nwhat abundance of rational experience, must have been required for\r\nenunciating the following admirable truth, and, as it were, law of\r\nnature: “Those things which bring alleviation with bad signs, and do\r\nnot remit with good, are troublesome and difficult.”\r\n\r\n6. Many passages bear reference to the condition of the vital powers,\r\nwhich they took into account at all times, both in making presages and\r\nin exercising the art. For, although they had not our theories of the\r\nvital force, they perceived its effects very well by observation; and\r\nfor this very reason, that they did not search for the art in theories,\r\nbut in observation alone, we owe so many excellent things to them,\r\nsince they did not adapt their observation to theories, but related a\r\ntrustworthy and faithful history of the operations of nature.\r\n\r\n7. They sought after many things from a comparison of health with\r\ndisease, in which also they rightly calculated the manners and customs\r\nof men. Thus they call that, in the first place, the best mode of\r\nreclining, which is adopted by the patient when in good health, and\r\nhence they estimate the other modes as being less good, or altogether\r\nunfavorable. Nor did they only compare health with disease, but\r\nthey compared also the symptoms of diseases with one another, and\r\ninterpreted the one from the other. Thus they first depict and\r\npronounce a favorable opinion on the best kind of excretions, and\r\nthen they described the other abnormal kinds, and pass an unfavorable\r\njudgment on them.\r\n\r\n8. They particularly relate the operations of a _natura medicatrix_,\r\nwhich, in a region such as Greece is, and in athletic, strong bodies,\r\non which they appear to have practised the art, and for the most part\r\nin acute diseases, and the few chronic ones derived from them which\r\nthey have left described, might especially be looked for. Hence that\r\ndoctrine of crises most deserving of attention, the rudiments, indeed,\r\nof which we only have here preserved, but a just notion of which we may\r\neasily draw from these fragments.\r\n\r\n9. The Asclepiadæ would appear to have accommodated and directed their\r\nart to this natural Therapia. Hence the advice that convulsions arising\r\nfrom a great hemorrhage, forcibly stopped, should be cured by the\r\nabstraction of blood. It is to be regretted that but a few monuments\r\nof their practice remain; but these embrace admirable imitations of\r\nnature, and the most prudent caution in administering remedies.\r\n\r\n10. Neither did they neglect surgery, but deliver many excellent\r\nremarks on things pertaining to wounds, ulcers, and fractures.\r\n\r\n11. Although it cannot be made out for certain that everything which is\r\npreserved in these writings existed before Hippocrates, there can be no\r\ndoubt that many of them are more ancient than he. And although we may\r\nattribute some things rather to Hippocrates himself, it is nevertheless\r\ncertain that the method of deducing the art from observation and\r\ncomparison had existed before him. Some may, perhaps, object that\r\nthese books are to be attributed to the youth of Hippocrates, and\r\nthat the others, more elaborate and perfect, had proceeded from the\r\nsame person in his old age; but this supposition we may refute by a\r\nsingle argument, namely, that it would be absurd to ascribe so many\r\nobservations about so many diseases to one man.\r\n\r\n12. From the whole Coan system of cultivating medicine, the best hopes\r\nmight justly have been expected; and from what follows it will be seen\r\nthat the result did not disappoint this expectation.”\r\n\r\nThese deductions, I must say, appear to be most legitimately\r\ndrawn; and having thus satisfactorily made out that the “Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones” are founded on the “Prorrhetics,” Dr. Ermerins proceeds\r\nto make an interesting comparison between the former and the book\r\nof “Prognostics.” Here again we can only find room for the general\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n1. “We have compared together two monuments of antiquity embracing\r\nentirely the same doctrine, so that we may hold it as put out of all\r\ndoubt that they must have derived their origin from the same school,\r\nonly the one yields to the other in antiquity, as its more expanded\r\nmode of expression shows.\r\n\r\n2. The more recent work is attributed to Hippocrates by all the critics\r\nand interpreters; the most ancient authors have made mention of it, and\r\nall the characteristic marks by which the genuine works of Hippocrates\r\nare distinguished from the spurious, without doubt, are found in it;\r\nfor whether you look to the brevity and gravity of the language, or the\r\npaucity of the reasonings, the correctness of the observations, or the\r\ndialect in which they are expressed, or, in fine, its agreement with\r\nthe whole Hippocratic doctrine,--all these attest that “the divine old\r\nman” is the author of this work.\r\n\r\n3. From a comparison of the “Coacæ Prænotiones” with the “Prognostics,”\r\nit is as clear as the light of day that Hippocrates composed this work\r\nfrom them, in such a manner that he circumscribed many of the symptoms,\r\nlimited the enunciations, and amplified them all by his own experience\r\nin the medical Art. Hence the Prognostics may not inaptly be called the\r\nCommentary of Hippocrates on the “Coacæ Prænotiones.”\r\n\r\n4. With regard to the exquisite and artificial order, in which we see\r\nmany things proposed in his book, we agree entirely with Sprengel, who\r\nthinks that they have proceeded from a more recent describer. This is\r\nconfirmed by our comparison of both works.\r\n\r\n5. This work exhibits the fundamental principles and originals of the\r\nHippocratic doctrine, and although we hardly know anything as to the\r\nmanlier in which Hippocrates composed his writings, and of the form\r\nwhich he gave them, it does not seem at all out of the way to hold this\r\nbook to be the oldest of all the works which “the Father of Medicine”\r\nhas left to us.\r\n\r\n6. Inasmuch as this work is entitled the Book of Prognostics, so\r\nit turns on the _prescience_ πρόνοια, that is to say, the\r\nforeknowledge of the physician, which Hippocrates recommends to\r\nphysicians for three reasons: first, for the confidence of mankind,\r\nwhich it will conciliate to the physician; then because it will free\r\nthe practitioner from all blame, if he has announced beforehand the\r\nfatal result of diseases; and further, as being a very great instrument\r\nin effecting the cure.\r\n\r\n7. Like the Coan priests, Hippocrates drew his Prognostics from a\r\ncomparison of disease with health. This he held to be of so great\r\nimportance, that he first delivers physiological semeiotics, and then\r\nadds pathological.\r\n\r\n8. In calculating and judging of signs he neglected neither age nor\r\nsex, and, in the first place, directed his mind to the power of habit\r\non the human body.\r\n\r\n9. Nor did Hippocrates stop here, but directed care to be had of the\r\nattack of epidemics, and the condition of the season.\r\n\r\n10. The Prognostics of Hippocrates are not of one time or place, but\r\nextend through every age, and through the whole world; inasmuch as the\r\nprognostic signs have been proved to be true in Libya, in Delos, and\r\nin Scythia, and it should be well known that every year, and at every\r\nseason of the year, bad symptoms bode ill, and good symptoms good.\r\n\r\n11. But he who would wish to know properly beforehand those who\r\nwill recover from a disease, and those who will die, and those in\r\nwhom the disease will persevere for many days, and those in whom it\r\nwill last for a few, should be able to comprehend and estimate the\r\ndoctrine of all the signs, and weigh in his mind and compare together\r\ntheir strength. The Hippocratic foreknowledge rests not only on the\r\nobservation of the signs, but also on the understanding of them.\r\n\r\n12. The Book of Prognostics exhibits observations of acute diseases,\r\nand of chronic arising from them, in which Hippocrates has diligently\r\nnoted the times and modes of the crises.\r\n\r\n13. Such is the authority of critical days and signs, that in those\r\nfevers which cease without the symptoms of resolution, and not upon\r\ncritical days, a relapse is to be expected.\r\n\r\n14. The series of critical days which Hippocrates delivers, proceeds\r\nsolely upon the observation of nature. Yet neither can any of them be\r\nexactly numbered by entire days, since neither the year nor the months\r\nare usually numbered by entire days.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ermerins, in the remaining part of his Essay, shows, in a very\r\nlucid manner, that the rules of Prognosis laid down in this treatise by\r\nHippocrates, are manifestly those by which he is regulated in his other\r\nworks, and more especially in the Epidemics and Aphorisms. We must\r\nnot, however, occupy room with any further exposition of the contents\r\nof this important treatise, which does equal credit to the author\r\nhimself, and to the medical system of education pursued in the learned\r\nuniversity from which it emanated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI will now give some remarks and reflections of my own on the treatise\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\nIn this work, then, Hippocrates appears to have had for his object, to\r\ngive such a general description of the phenomena of disease as would\r\napply to all the disorders of the animal frame. With this intention\r\nhe brings into review the state of the countenance, the position of\r\nthe patient in bed, the movements of the hands, the respiration,\r\nthe sweats, the state of the hypochondria, dropsies which are the\r\nconsequences of acute diseases, the sleep, the urine, the alvine\r\ndejections, the vomitings, and the sputa. In doing this, his uniform\r\npractice is to contrast the healthy with the morbid appearances.\r\nAlthough M. Littré regards it as a treatise on special Pathology, it\r\nappears to me to be decidedly a general work on Semeiology. Certain it\r\nis that all the best commentators, such as Erotian and Stephanus,[458]\r\ndecidedly regard it as a semeiological work. The class of ancient\r\nwritings with which it admits of being most closely compared, are\r\nthe works on the prognostics of the weather. On this subject Greek\r\nliterature contains several works of a very philosophical nature,\r\nsuch as the Phænomena of Aratus, and several of the minor tracts of\r\nTheophrastus. Now as the object of these authors was to connect the\r\nmost striking phenomena in the sky, the earth, and the sea, with\r\nthe changes in the weather, of which they are the precursors, so\r\nthe intention of the medical writer of Prognostics was to point out\r\nthe alterations in the animal frame, which certain preternatural\r\nsymptoms usually indicate. And as the utility of an acquaintance with\r\nprognostics of the weather to the husbandman and sailor is sufficiently\r\nobvious, the benefit to be derived from a knowledge of medical\r\nprognostics by the physician is equally so. Our author, it will be seen\r\nin the Preface to this work, enumerates three objects to be attained\r\nby cultivating an acquaintance with prognostics; first, to attract the\r\nconfidence of one’s patients; second, to free the physician from blame\r\nby enabling him to announce beforehand the issue of the disorder about\r\nwhich he is consulted; and, third, to give him a decided advantage in\r\nconducting the treatment by preparing him for remarkable changes in\r\nthe diseases before they occur. And, in like manner, I may be allowed\r\nto remark, the master of a ship who shows himself prepared for all\r\nchanges of the weather, will naturally attract the confidence of those\r\nintrusted to his charge; and whatever may be the result, he will be\r\nfreed from blame if his ship should be damaged in a storm which he had\r\npreviously predicted; and surely his knowledge of impending commotions\r\nin the sea and sky, will be of advantage to him by enabling him to make\r\npreparations for them.\r\n\r\nLooking then to the importance of general Prognostics, I have often\r\nwondered why this branch of Semeiology is no longer cultivated by the\r\nprofession. Did not the ancient physicians follow the best possible\r\nplan when they first described the general phenomena of diseased\r\naction, and then applied them to particular cases? Surely they did\r\nright in first taking a comprehensive view of the whole subject of\r\ndisease before attempting to examine the different parts of it in\r\ndetail. This, in fact, constitutes the great superiority of the ancient\r\n_savans_ over the modern, that the former possessed a much\r\ngreater talent for apprehending general truths than the latter, who\r\nconfine their attention to particular facts, and too much neglect the\r\nobservation of general appearances. I trust no one will be offended\r\nif I venture to pronounce regarding the present condition of our\r\nprofessional literature, that (to borrow an illustration from the Logic\r\nof Kant) it is altogether Cyclopic,--that is to say, it wants the eye\r\nof Philosophy, for, although we have learned to examine particular\r\nobjects with greater accuracy than our forefathers did, the sphere\r\nof our mental vision, so to speak, is more confined than theirs, and\r\ncannot embrace the same enlarged views of general subjects. Surely then\r\nwe might gain a useful lesson by endeavoring to combine their more\r\ncomprehensive views with our own more accurate and minute observation.\r\n\r\nSome people may be inclined to think that we have greatly detracted\r\nfrom the credit which Hippocrates has long enjoyed as being the\r\nundoubted author of this work, by showing that in composing it he\r\nwas so much indebted to the labors of his predecessors. But I have\r\nlong been impressed with the conviction that in compositions even of\r\nthe highest order, there is much less originality than is generally\r\nsupposed, and that true genius frequently is displayed more in its\r\nown felicitous way of dealing with materials formerly prepared and\r\ncollected for its use than in searching out new matter to work\r\nupon,[459] and hence it will be found upon examination that many of the\r\nmost distinguished efforts of human intellect have consisted in the\r\nsuccessful performance of tasks which had been frequently attempted by\r\nprevious laborers in the same line. Many artists, before the time of\r\nPhidias, had acquired reputation by their attempts at making the statue\r\nof Jupiter;[460] but this did not deter him from undertaking the same\r\ntask: and we may well believe that he would avail himself of every\r\npractical lesson which he could draw from the success or failure of his\r\npredecessors, in perfecting that matchless performance which completely\r\ncast all others into the background. The sad misfortunes of Œdipus had\r\nbeen often represented on the Athenian stage before Sophocles made them\r\nthe subject of those inimitable dramas, which still enjoy an unrivalled\r\nreputation, nor will it be often considered how much assistance he may\r\nhave derived from the labors of those who had gone before him. It is\r\nwell known that of all the literary performances of Aristotle, there\r\nis no one which gained him so enduring a reputation as his Categories,\r\nand yet it is admitted that his division of the subject into the ten\r\nPredicaments, was taken from the Pythagorean philosopher Archytas;[461]\r\nin short, the great merit of Aristotle on this as on many other\r\noccasions, consisted in defining and arranging a subject on which much\r\nhad been previously effected by the labors of his predecessors. And, to\r\ngive one example more, long before the time of Galen, the temperaments,\r\nand the facts in physiology and pathology bearing upon Hygiene, had\r\nbeen frequently and successfully investigated, but he, by recasting all\r\nthese subject-matters into his _Ars Medica_, composed a work which\r\nposterity regarded as his master-performance, and every word and tittle\r\nof which, for a succession ages, were commented upon and admired in\r\nthe Schools of Medicine. And of all our Author’s admired performances,\r\nthere is perhaps no one which has exerted so great an influence upon\r\nthe literature of the profession as the present work, for all the\r\nGreek, Roman, and Arabian writers on medicine, subsequent to him, make\r\nuse of his terms, and copy his descriptions of morbid phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE BOOK OF PROGNOSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It appears to me a most excellent thing for the physician to\r\ncultivate Prognosis; for by foreseeing and foretelling, in the presence\r\nof the sick, the present, the past, and the future, and explaining\r\nthe omissions which patients have been guilty of,[462] he will be the\r\nmore readily believed to be acquainted with the circumstances of the\r\nsick; so that men will have confidence to intrust themselves to such a\r\nphysician. And he will manage the cure best who has foreseen what is\r\nto happen from the present state of matters. For it is impossible to\r\nmake all the sick well; this, indeed, would have been better than to\r\nbe able to foretell what is going to happen; but since men die, some\r\neven before calling the physician, from the violence of the disease,\r\nand some die immediately after calling him, having lived, perhaps,\r\nonly one day or a little longer, and before the physician could bring\r\nhis art to counteract the disease; it therefore becomes necessary to\r\nknow the nature of such affections, how far they are above the powers\r\nof the constitution; and, moreover, if there be anything divine in the\r\ndiseases,[463] and to learn a foreknowledge of this also. Thus a man\r\nwill be the more esteemed to be a good physician, for he will be the\r\nbetter able to treat those aright who can be saved, from having long\r\nanticipated everything; and by seeing and announcing beforehand those\r\nwho will live and those who will die, he will thus escape censure.[464]\r\n\r\n2. He should observe thus in acute diseases: first, the countenance\r\nof the patient, if it be like those of persons in health, and more so,\r\nif like itself, for this is the best of all; whereas the most opposite\r\nto it is the worst, such as the following; _a sharp nose, hollow\r\neyes, collapsed temples_; _the ears cold, contracted, and their\r\nlobes turned out_: _the skin about the forehead being rough,\r\ndistended, and parched_; _the color of the whole face being green,\r\nblack, livid, or lead-colored_.[465] If the countenance be such\r\nat the commencement of the disease, and if this cannot be accounted\r\nfor from the other symptoms, inquiry must be made whether the patient\r\nhas long wanted sleep; whether his bowels have been very loose; and\r\nwhether he has suffered from want of food; and if any of these causes\r\nbe confessed to, the danger is to be reckoned so far less; and it\r\nbecomes obvious, in the course of a day and a night, whether or not the\r\nappearance of the countenance proceeded from these causes.[466] But\r\nif none of these be said to exist, and if the symptoms do not subside\r\nin the aforesaid time, it is to be known for certain that death is at\r\nhand. And, also, if the disease be in a more advanced stage either\r\non the third or fourth day, and the countenance be such, the same\r\ninquiries as formerly directed are to be made, and the other symptoms\r\nare to be noted, those in the whole countenance, those on the body, and\r\nthose in the eyes; for if they shun the light, or weep involuntarily,\r\nor squint, or if the one be less than the other, or if the white of\r\nthem be red, livid, or has black veins in it; if there be a gum upon\r\nthe eyes, if they are restless, protruding, or are become very hollow;\r\nand if the countenance be squalid and dark, or the color of the whole\r\nface be changed--all these are to be reckoned bad and fatal symptoms.\r\nThe physician should also observe the appearance of the eyes from below\r\nthe eyelids in sleep; for when a portion of the white appears, owing to\r\nthe eyelids not being closed together, and when this is not connected\r\nwith diarrhœa or purgation from medicine, or when the patient does not\r\nsleep thus from habit, it is to be reckoned an unfavorable and very\r\ndeadly symptom; but if the eyelid be contracted, livid, or pale, or\r\nalso the lip, or nose, along with some of the other symptoms, one may\r\nknow for certain that death is close at hand. It is a mortal symptom,\r\nalso, when the lips are relaxed, pendent, cold, and blanched.\r\n\r\n3.[467] It is well when the patient is found by his physician\r\nreclining upon either his right or his left side, having his hands,\r\nneck, and legs slightly bent, and the whole body lying in a relaxed\r\nstate, for thus the most of persons in health recline, and these are\r\nthe best of postures which most resemble those of healthy persons. But\r\nto lie upon one’s back, with the hands, neck, and the legs extended,\r\nis far less favorable. And if the patient incline forward, and sink\r\ndown to the foot of the bed, it is a still more dangerous symptom; but\r\nif he be found with his feet naked and not sufficiently warm, and the\r\nhands, neck, and legs tossed about in a disorderly manner and naked,\r\nit is bad, for it indicates aberration of intellect. It is a deadly\r\nsymptom, also, when the patient sleeps constantly with his mouth open,\r\nhaving his legs strongly bent and plaited together, while he lies upon\r\nhis back; and to lie upon one’s belly, when not habitual to the patient\r\nto sleep thus while in good health, indicates delirium, or pain in the\r\nabdominal regions. And for the patient to wish to sit erect at the acme\r\nof a disease is a bad symptom in all acute diseases, but particularly\r\nso in pneumonia.[468] To grind the teeth in fevers, when such has not\r\nbeen the custom of the patient from childhood, indicates madness and\r\ndeath, both which dangers are to be announced beforehand as likely\r\nto happen; and if a person in delirium do this it is a very deadly\r\nsymptom. And if the patient had an ulcer previously, or if one has\r\noccurred in the course of the disease, it is to be observed; for if the\r\nman be about to die the sore will become livid and dry, or yellow and\r\ndry before death.[469]\r\n\r\n4. Respecting the movement of the hands I have these observations to\r\nmake: When in acute fevers, pneumonia, phrenitis, or headache, the\r\nhands are waved before the face, hunting through empty space, as if\r\ngathering bits of straw, picking the nap from the coverlet, or tearing\r\nchaff from the wall--all such symptoms are bad and deadly.[470]\r\n\r\n5. Respiration, when frequent, indicates pain or inflammation in the\r\nparts above the diaphragm: a large respiration performed at a great\r\ninterval announces delirium; but a cold respiration at nose or mouth\r\nis a very fatal symptom. Free respiration is to be looked upon as\r\ncontributing much to the safety of the patient in all acute diseases,\r\nsuch as fevers, and those complaints which come to a crisis in forty\r\ndays.[471]\r\n\r\n6. Those sweats are the best in all acute diseases which occur on the\r\ncritical days, and completely carry off the fever. Those are favorable,\r\ntoo, which taking place over the whole body, show that the man is\r\nbearing the disease better. But those that do not produce this effect\r\nare not beneficial. The worst are cold sweats, confined to the head,\r\nface, and neck; these in an acute fever prognosticate death, or in a\r\nmilder one, a prolongation of the disease; and sweats which occur over\r\nthe whole body, with the characters of those confined to the neck, are\r\nin like manner bad. Sweats attended with a miliary eruption, and taking\r\nplace about the neck, are bad; sweats in the form of drops and of\r\nvapour are good. One ought to know the entire character of sweats, for\r\nsome are connected with prostration of strength in the body, and some\r\nwith intensity of the inflammation.[472]\r\n\r\n7.[473] That state of the hypochondrium is best when it is free from\r\npain, soft, and of equal size on the right side and the left. But\r\nif inflamed, or painful, or distended; or when the right and left\r\nsides are of disproportionate sizes;--all these appearances are to\r\nbe dreaded. And if there be also pulsation in the hypochondrium, it\r\nindicates perturbation or delirium; and the physician should examine\r\nthe eyes of such persons; for if their pupils be in rapid motion, such\r\npersons may be expected to go mad. A swelling in the hypochondrium,\r\nthat is hard and painful, is very bad, provided it occupy the whole\r\nhypochondrium; but if it be on either side, it is less dangerous\r\nwhen on the left. Such swellings at the commencement of the disease\r\nprognosticate speedy death; but if the fever has passed twenty days,\r\nand the swelling has not subsided, it turns to a suppuration.[474] A\r\ndischarge of blood from the nose occurs to such in the first period,\r\nand proves very useful; but inquiry should be made if they have\r\nheadache or indistinct vision; for if there be such, the disease will\r\nbe determined thither. The discharge of blood is rather to be expected\r\nin those who are younger than thirty-five years. Such swellings as\r\nare soft, free from pain, and yield to the finger, occasion more\r\nprotracted crises, and are less dangerous than the others. But if\r\nthe fever continue beyond sixty days, without any subsidence of the\r\nswelling, it indicates that empyema is about to take place; and a\r\nswelling in any other part of the cavity will terminate in like manner.\r\nSuch, then, as are painful, hard, and large, indicate danger of speedy\r\ndeath; but such as are soft, free of pain, and yield when pressed\r\nwith the finger, are more chronic than these. Swellings in the belly\r\nless frequently form abscesses than those in the hypochondrium; and\r\nseldomest of all, those below the navel are converted into suppuration;\r\nbut you may rather expect a hemorrhage from the upper parts. But the\r\nsuppuration of all protracted swellings about these parts is to be\r\nanticipated. The collections of matter there are to be thus judged of:\r\nsuch as are determined outwards are the best when they are small, when\r\nthey protrude very much, and swell to a point; such as are large and\r\nbroad, and which do not swell out to a sharp point, are the worst. Of\r\nsuch as break internally, the best are those which have no external\r\ncommunication, but are covered and indolent; and when the whole\r\nplace is free from discoloration. That pus is best which is white,\r\nhomogeneous, smooth, and not at all fetid; the contrary to this is the\r\nworst.\r\n\r\n8.[475] All dropsies arising from acute diseases are bad; for they do\r\nnot remove the fever, and are very painful and fatal. The most of them\r\ncommence from the flanks and loins, but some from the liver; in those\r\nwhich derive their origin from the flanks and loins the feet swell,\r\nprotracted diarrhœas supervene, which neither remove the pains in the\r\nflanks and loins, nor soften the belly;[476] but in dropsies which are\r\nconnected with the liver there is a tickling cough, with scarcely any\r\nperceptible expectoration, and the feet swell; there are no evacuations\r\nfrom the bowels, unless such as are hard and forced; and there are\r\nswellings about the belly, sometimes on the one side and sometimes on\r\nthe other, and these increase and diminish by turns.[477]\r\n\r\n9. It is a bad symptom when the head, hands, and feet are cold, while\r\nthe belly and sides are hot; but it is a very good symptom when the\r\nwhole body is equally hot.[478] The patient ought to be able to turn\r\nround easily, and to be agile when raised up; but if he appear heavy\r\nin the rest of his body as well as in his hands and feet, it is more\r\ndangerous; and if, in addition to the weight, his nails and fingers\r\nbecome livid, immediate death may be anticipated; and if the hands and\r\nfeet be black it is less dangerous than if they be livid, but the other\r\nsymptoms must be attended to; for if he appear to bear the illness\r\nwell, and if certain of the salutary symptoms appear along with these\r\nthere may be hope that the disease will turn to a deposition, so that\r\nthe man may recover; but the blackened parts of the body will drop off.\r\nWhen the testicles and members are retracted upwards, they indicate\r\nstrong pains and danger of death.[479]\r\n\r\n10. With regard to sleep--as is usual with us in health, the patient\r\nshould wake during the day and sleep during the night. If this rule\r\nbe anywise altered it is so far worse: but there will be little harm\r\nprovided he sleep in the morning for the third part of the day; such\r\nsleep as takes place after this time is more unfavorable; but the worst\r\nof all is to get no sleep either night or day; for it follows from this\r\nsymptom that the insomnolency is connected with sorrow and pains, or\r\nthat he is about to become delirious.[480]\r\n\r\n11. The excrement is best which is soft and consistent, is passed\r\nat the hour which was customary to the patient when in health, in\r\nquantity proportionate to the ingesta; for when the passages are such,\r\nthe lower belly is in a healthy state.[481] But if the discharges be\r\nfluid, it is favorable that they are not accompanied with a noise,\r\nnor are frequent, nor in great quantity; for the man being oppressed\r\nby frequently getting up, must be deprived of sleep; and if the\r\nevacuations be both frequent and large, there is danger of his falling\r\ninto deliquium animi.[482] But in proportion to the ingesta he should\r\nhave evacuations twice or thrice in the day, once at night and more\r\ncopiously in the morning, as is customary with a person in health. The\r\nfæces should become thicker when the disease is tending to a crisis;\r\nthey ought to be yellowish and not very fetid. It is favorable that\r\nround worms be passed with the discharges when the disease is tending\r\nto a crisis.[483] The belly, too, through the whole disease, should be\r\nsoft and moderately distended; but excrements that are very watery, or\r\nwhite, or green, or very red, or frothy, are all bad. It is also bad\r\nwhen the discharge is small, and viscid, and white, and greenish, and\r\nsmooth; but still more deadly appearances are the black, or fatty, or\r\nlivid, or verdigris-green, or fetid. Such as are of varied characters\r\nindicate greater duration of the complaint, but are no less dangerous;\r\nsuch as those which resemble scrapings,[484] those which are bilious,\r\nthose resembling leeks, and the black; these being sometimes passed\r\ntogether, and sometimes singly.[485] It is best when wind passes\r\nwithout noise, but it is better that flatulence should pass even\r\nthus than that it should be retained; and when it does pass thus, it\r\nindicates either that the man is in pain or in delirium, unless he\r\ngives vent to the wind spontaneously.[486] Pains in the hypochondria,\r\nand swellings, if recent, and not accompanied with inflammation,\r\nare relieved by borborygmi supervening in the hypochondrium, more\r\nespecially if it pass off with fæces, urine, and wind; but even\r\nalthough not, it will do good by passing along, and it also does good\r\nby descending to the lower part of the belly.[487]\r\n\r\n12. The urine is best when the sediment is white, smooth, and\r\nconsistent during the whole time, until the disease come to a crisis,\r\nfor it indicates freedom from danger, and an illness of short\r\nduration; but if deficient, and if it be sometimes passed clear, and\r\nsometimes with a white and smooth sediment, the disease will be more\r\nprotracted, and not so void of danger. But if the urine be reddish,\r\nand the sediment consistent and smooth, the affection, in this case,\r\nwill be more protracted than the former, but still not fatal.[488] But\r\nfarinaceous sediments in the urine are bad, and still worse are the\r\nleafy;[489] the white and thin are very bad, but the furfuraceous are\r\nstill worse than these. Clouds carried about in the urine are good\r\nwhen white, but bad if black. When the urine is yellow and thin, it\r\nindicates that the disease is unconcocted; and if it (the disease)\r\nshould be protracted, there may be danger lest the patient should not\r\nhold out until the urine be concocted.[490] But the most deadly of\r\nall kinds of urine are the fetid, watery, black, and thick; in adult\r\nmen and women the black is of all kinds of urine the worst, but in\r\nchildren, the watery.[491] In those who pass thin and crude urine for\r\na length of time, if they have otherwise symptoms of convalescence, an\r\nabscess may be expected to form in the parts below the diaphragm.[492]\r\nAnd fatty substances floating on the surface are to be dreaded, for\r\nthey are indications of melting. And one should consider respecting\r\nthe kinds of urine, which have clouds, whether they tend upwards or\r\ndownwards, and the colors which they have and such as fall downwards,\r\nwith the colors as described, are to be reckoned good and commended;\r\nbut such as are carried upwards, with the colors as described, are to\r\nbe held as bad, and are to be distrusted.[493] But you must not allow\r\nyourself to be deceived if such urine be passed while the bladder is\r\ndiseased; for then it is a symptom of the state, not of the general\r\nsystem, but of a particular viscus.[494]\r\n\r\n13. That vomiting is of most service which consists of phlegm and\r\nbile mixed together, and neither very thick nor in great quantity; but\r\nthose vomitings which are more unmixed are worse. But if that which is\r\nvomited be of the color of leeks or livid, or black, whatever of these\r\ncolors it be, it is to be reckoned bad; but if the same man vomit all\r\nthese colors, it is to be reckoned a very fatal symptom. But of all\r\nthe vomitings, the livid indicates the most imminent danger of death,\r\nprovided it be of a fetid smell. But all the smells which are somewhat\r\nputrid and fetid, are bad in all vomitings.[495]\r\n\r\n14. The expectoration in all pains about the lungs and sides, should\r\nbe quickly and easily brought up, and a certain degree of yellowness\r\nshould appear strongly mixed up with the sputum. But if brought up long\r\nafter the commencement of the pain, and of a yellow or ruddy color, or\r\nif it occasions much cough, or be not strongly mixed, it is worse; for\r\nthat which is intensely yellow is dangerous, but the white, and viscid,\r\nand round, do no good. But that which is very green and frothy is bad;\r\nbut if so intense as to appear black, it is still more dangerous than\r\nthese; it is bad if nothing is expectorated, and the lungs discharge\r\nnothing, but are gorged with matters which boil (as it were) in the\r\nair-passages. It is bad when coryza and sneezing either precede or\r\nfollow affections of the lungs, but in all other affections, even the\r\nmost deadly, sneezing is a salutary symptom.[496] A yellow spittle\r\nmixed up with not much blood in cases of pneumonia, is salutary and\r\nvery beneficial if spit up at the commencement of the disease, but if\r\non the seventh day, or still later, it is less favorable. And all sputa\r\nare bad which do not remove the pain. But the worst is the black, as\r\nhas been described. Of all others the sputa which remove the pain are\r\nthe best.[497]\r\n\r\n15. When the pains in these regions do not cease, either with\r\nthe discharge of the sputa, nor with alvine evacuations, nor from\r\nvenesection, purging with medicine, nor a suitable regimen, it is to\r\nbe held that they will terminate in suppurations.[498] Of empyemata\r\nsuch as are spit up while the sputum is still bilious, are very fatal,\r\nwhether the bilious portion be expectorated separate, or along with\r\nthe other; but more especially if the empyema begin to advance after\r\nthis sputum on the seventh day of the disease. It is to be expected\r\nthat a person with such an expectoration shall die on the fourteenth\r\nday, unless something favorable supervene. The following are favorable\r\nsymptoms: to support the disease easily, to have free respiration, to\r\nbe free from pain, to have the sputa readily brought up, the whole body\r\nto appear equally warm and soft, to have no thirst, the urine, and\r\nfæces, sleep, and sweats to be all favorable, as described before; when\r\nall these symptoms concur, the patient certainly will not die; but if\r\nsome of these be present and some not, he will not survive longer than\r\nthe fourteenth day. The bad symptoms are the opposite of these, namely,\r\nto bear the disease with difficulty, respiration large and dense, the\r\npain not ceasing, the sputum scarcely coughed up, strong thirst, to\r\nhave the body unequally affected by the febrile heat, the belly and\r\nsides intensely hot, the forehead, hands, and feet cold; the urine, and\r\nexcrements, the sleep, and sweats, all bad, agreeably to the characters\r\ndescribed above; if such a combination of symptoms accompany and either\r\non the ninth or eleventh. Thus then one may conclude regarding this\r\nexpectoration, that it is very deadly, and that the patient will not\r\nsurvive until the fourteenth day. It is by balancing the concomitant\r\nsymptoms whether good or bad, that one is to form a prognosis; for thus\r\nit will most probably prove to be a true one. Most other suppurations\r\nburst, some on the twentieth, some on the thirtieth, some on the\r\nfortieth, and some as late as the sixtieth day.[499]\r\n\r\n16. One should estimate when the commencement of the suppuration will\r\ntake place, by calculating from the day on which the patient was first\r\nseized with fever, or if he had a rigor, and if he says, that there is\r\na weight in the place where he had pain formerly, for these symptoms\r\noccur in the commencement of suppurations. One then may expect the\r\nrupture of the abscesses to take place from these times according to\r\nthe periods formerly stated. But if the empyema be only on either side,\r\none should turn him and inquire if he has pain on the other side; and\r\nif the one side be hotter than the other, and when laid upon the sound\r\nside, one should inquire if he has the feeling of a weight hanging from\r\nabove, for if so, the empyema will be upon the opposite side to that on\r\nwhich the weight was felt.[500]\r\n\r\n17. Empyema may be recognized in all cases by the following symptoms:\r\nIn the first place, the fever does not go off, but is slight during the\r\nday, and increases at night, and copious sweats supervene, there is a\r\ndesire to cough, and the patients expectorate nothing worth mentioning,\r\nthe eyes become hollow, the cheeks have red spots on them, the nails of\r\nthe hands are bent, the fingers are hot especially their extremities,\r\nthere are swellings in the feet, they have no desire of food, and\r\nsmall blisters (phlyctænæ) occur over the body. These symptoms attend\r\nchronic empyemata, and may be much trusted to; and such as are of short\r\nstanding are indicated by the same, provided they be accompanied by\r\nthose signs which occur at the commencement, and if at the same time\r\nthe patient has some difficulty of breathing. Whether they will break\r\nearlier or later may be determined by these symptoms; if there be\r\npain at the commencement, and if the dyspnœa, cough, and ptyalism be\r\nsevere, the rupture may be expected in the course of twenty days or\r\nstill earlier; but if the pain be more mild, and all the other symptoms\r\nin proportion, you may expect from these the rupture to be later; but\r\npain, dyspnœa, and ptyalism, must take place before the rupture of the\r\nabscess. Those patients recover most readily whom the fever leaves the\r\nsame day that the abscess bursts,--when they recover their appetite\r\nspeedily, and are freed from the thirst,--when the alvine discharges\r\nare small and consistent, the matter white, smooth, uniform in color,\r\nand free of phlegm, and if brought up without pain or strong coughing.\r\nThose die whom the fever does not leave, or when appearing to leave\r\nthem it returns with an exacerbation; when they have thirst, but no\r\ndesire of food, and there are watery discharges from the bowels; when\r\nthe expectoration is green or livid, or pituitous and frothy; if all\r\nthese occur they die, but if certain of these symptoms supervene, and\r\nothers not, some patients die and some recover, after a long interval.\r\nBut from all the symptoms taken together one should form a judgment,\r\nand so in all other cases.\r\n\r\n18. When abscesses form about the ears, after peripneumonic\r\naffections, or depositions of matter take place in the inferior\r\nextremities and end in fistula, such persons recover. The following\r\nobservations are to be made upon them: if the fever persist, and the\r\npain do not cease, if the expectoration be not normal, and if the\r\nalvine discharges be neither bilious, nor free and unmixed; and if the\r\nurine be neither copious nor have its proper sediment, but if, on the\r\nother hand, all the other salutary symptoms be present, in such cases\r\nabscesses may be expected to take place. They form in the inferior\r\nparts when there is a collection of phlegm about the hypochondria; and\r\nin the upper when the hypochondria continue soft and free of pain, and\r\nwhen dyspnœa having been present for a certain time, ceases without any\r\nobvious cause.[501] All deposits which take place in the legs after\r\nsevere and dangerous attacks of pneumonia, are salutary, but the best\r\nare those which occur at the time when the sputa undergo a change;\r\nfor if the swelling and pain take place while the sputa are changing\r\nfrom yellow and becoming of a purulent character, and are expectorated\r\nfreely, under these circumstances the man will recover most favorably\r\nand the abscess becoming free of pain, will soon cease; but if the\r\nexpectoration is not free, and the urine does not appear to have the\r\nproper sediment, there is danger lest the limb should be maimed, or\r\nthat the case otherwise should give trouble. But if the abscesses\r\ndisappear and go back, while expectoration does not take place, and\r\nfever prevails, it is a bad symptom; for there is danger that the man\r\nmay get into a state of delirium and die. Of persons having empyema\r\nafter peripneumonic affections, those that are advanced in life run\r\nthe greatest risk of dying; but in the other kinds of empyema younger\r\npersons rather die.[502] In cases of empyema treated by the cautery or\r\nincision, when the matter is pure, white, and not fetid, the patient\r\nrecovers; but if of a bloody and dirty character, he dies.[503]\r\n\r\n19. Pains accompanied with fever which occur about the loins and\r\nlower parts, if they attack the diaphragm, and leave the parts below,\r\nare very fatal. Wherefore one ought to pay attention to the other\r\nsymptoms, since if any unfavorable one supervene, the case is hopeless;\r\nbut if while the disease is determined to the diaphragm, the other\r\nsymptoms are not bad, there is great reason to expect that it will\r\nend in empyema.[504] When the bladder is hard and painful, it is an\r\nextremely bad and mortal symptom, more especially in cases attended\r\nwith continued fever; for the pains proceeding from the bladder alone\r\nare enough to kill the patient; and at such a time the bowels are\r\nnot moved, or the discharges are hard and forced. But urine of a\r\npurulent character, and having a white and smooth sediment, relieves\r\nthe patient. But if no amendment takes place in the characters of the\r\nurine, nor the bladder become soft, and the fever is of the continual\r\ntype, it may be expected that the patient will die in the first stages\r\nof the complaint. This form attacks children more especially, from\r\ntheir seventh to their fifteenth year.[505]\r\n\r\n20. Fevers come to a crisis on the same days as to number on which men\r\nrecover and die. For the mildest class of fevers, and those originating\r\nwith the most favorable symptoms, cease on the fourth day or earlier;\r\nand the most malignant, and those setting in with the most dangerous\r\nsymptoms, prove fatal on the fourth day or earlier. The first class of\r\nthem as to violence ends thus: the second is protracted to the seventh\r\nday, the third to the eleventh, the fourth to the fourteenth, the\r\nfifth to the seventeenth, and the sixth to the twentieth. Thus these\r\nperiods from the most acute disease ascend by fours up to twenty. But\r\nnone of these can be truly calculated by whole days, for neither the\r\nyear nor the months can be numbered by entire days. After these in the\r\nsame manner, according to the same progression, the first period is\r\nof thirty-four days, the second of forty days, and the third of sixty\r\ndays. In the commencement of these it is very difficult to determine\r\nthose which will come to a crisis after a long interval; for these\r\nbeginnings are very similar, but one should pay attention from the\r\nfirst day, and observe further at every additional tetrad, and then one\r\ncannot miss seeing how the disease will terminate. The constitution\r\nof quartans is agreeable to the same order. Those which will come to\r\na crisis in the shortest space of time, are the easiest to be judged\r\nof; for the differences of them are greatest from the commencement,\r\nthus those who are going to recover breathe freely, and do not suffer\r\npain, they sleep during the night, and have the other salutary\r\nsymptoms, whereas those that are to die have difficult respiration, are\r\ndelirious, troubled with insomnolency, and have other bad symptoms.\r\nMatters being thus, one may conjecture, according to the time, and each\r\nadditional period of the diseases, as they proceed to a crisis. And\r\nin women, after parturition, the crises proceed agreeably to the same\r\nratio.[506]\r\n\r\n21. Strong and continued headaches with fever, if any of the deadly\r\nsymptoms be joined to them, are very fatal. But if without such\r\nsymptoms the pain be prolonged beyond twenty days, a discharge of blood\r\nfrom the nose or some abscess in the inferior parts may be anticipated;\r\nbut while the pain is recent, we may expect in like manner a discharge\r\nof blood from the nose, or a suppuration, especially if the pain be\r\nseated above the temples and forehead; but the hemorrhage is rather to\r\nbe looked for in persons younger than thirty years, and the suppuration\r\nin more elderly persons.[507]\r\n\r\n22. Acute pain of the ear, with continual and strong fever, is to be\r\ndreaded; for there is danger that the man may become delirious and die.\r\nSince, then, this is a hazardous spot, one ought to pay particular\r\nattention to all these symptoms from the commencement. Younger persons\r\ndie of this disease on the seventh day, or still earlier, but old\r\npersons much later; for the fevers and delirium less frequently\r\nsupervene upon them, and on that account the ears previously come to\r\na suppuration, but at these periods of life, relapses of the disease\r\ncoming on generally prove fatal. Younger persons die before the ear\r\nsuppurates; only if white matter run from the ear, there may be hope\r\nthat a younger person will recover, provided any other favorable\r\nsymptom be combined.[508]\r\n\r\n23. Ulceration of the throat with fever, is a serious affection,\r\nand if any other of the symptoms formerly described as being bad,\r\nbe present, the physician ought to announce that his patient is in\r\ndanger.[509] Those quinsies are most dangerous, and most quickly prove\r\nfatal, which make no appearance in the fauces, nor in the neck, but\r\noccasion very great pain and difficulty of breathing; these induce\r\nsuffocation on the first day, or on the second, the third, or the\r\nfourth.[510] Such as, in like manner, are attended with pain, are\r\nswelled up, and have redness (erythema) in the throat, are indeed very\r\nfatal, but more protracted than the former, provided the redness be\r\ngreat.[511] Those cases in which both the throat and the neck are red,\r\nare more protracted, and certain persons recover from them, especially\r\nif the neck and breast be affected with erythema, and the erysipelas\r\nbe not determined inwardly.[512] If neither the erysipelas disappear\r\non the critical day, nor any abscess form outwardly, nor any pus be\r\nspit up, and if the patient fancy himself well, and be free from\r\npain, death, or a relapse of the erythema is to be apprehended. It\r\nis much less hazardous when the swelling and redness are determined\r\noutwardly; but if determined to the lungs, they superinduce delirium,\r\nand frequently some of these cases terminate in empyema.[513] It is\r\nvery dangerous to cut off or scarify enlarged uvulæ while they are red\r\nand large, for inflammations and hemorrhages supervene; but one should\r\ntry to reduce such swellings by some other means at this season. When\r\nthe whole of it is converted into an abscess, which is called Uva, or\r\nwhen the extremity of the variety called Columella is larger and round,\r\nbut the upper part thinner, at this time it will be safe to operate.\r\nBut it will be better to open the bowels gently before proceeding to\r\nthe operation, if time will permit, and the patient be not in danger of\r\nbeing suffocated.[514]\r\n\r\n24. When the fevers cease without any symptoms of resolution\r\noccurring, and not on the critical days, in such cases a relapse may\r\nbe anticipated.[515] When any of the fevers is protracted, although\r\nthe man exhibits symptoms of recovery, and there is no longer pain\r\nfrom any inflammation, nor from any other visible cause, in such a\r\ncase a deposit, with swelling and pain, may be expected in some one\r\nof the joints, and not improbably in those below. Such deposits occur\r\nmore readily and in less time to persons under thirty years of age;\r\nand one should immediately suspect the formation of such a deposit, if\r\nthe fever be protracted beyond twenty days; but to aged persons these\r\nless seldom happen, and not until the fever be much longer protracted.\r\nSuch a deposit may be expected, when the fever is of a continual type,\r\nand that it will pass into a quartan, if it become intermittent, and\r\nits paroxysms come on in an irregular manner, and if in this form it\r\napproach autumn. As deposits form most readily in persons below thirty\r\nyears of age, so quartans most commonly occur to persons beyond that\r\nage. It is proper to know that deposits occur most readily in winter,\r\nthat then they are most protracted, but are less given to return.[516]\r\nWhoever, in a fever that is not of a fatal character, says that he has\r\npain in his head, and that something dark appears to be before his\r\neyes, and that he has pain at the stomach, will be seized with vomiting\r\nof bile; but if rigor also attack him, and the inferior parts of the\r\nhypochondrium are cold, vomiting is still nearer at hand; and if he\r\neat or drink anything at such a season, it will be quickly vomited.\r\nIn these cases, when the pain commences on the first day, they are\r\nparticularly oppressed on the fourth and the fifth; and they are\r\nrelieved on the seventh, but the greater part of them begin to have\r\npain on the third day, and are most especially tossed on the fifth,\r\nbut are relieved on the ninth or eleventh; but in those who begin to\r\nhave pains on the fifth day, and other matters proceed properly with\r\nthem, the disease comes to a crisis on the fourteenth day. But when in\r\nsuch a fever persons affected with headache, instead of having a dark\r\nappearance before their eyes, have dimness of vision, or flashes of\r\nlight appear before their eyes, and instead of pain at the pit of the\r\nstomach, they have in their hypochondrium a fulness stretching either\r\nto the right or left side, without either pain or inflammation, a\r\nhemorrhage from the nose is to be expected in such a case, rather than\r\na vomiting. But it is in young persons particularly that the hemorrhage\r\nis to be expected, for in persons beyond the age of thirty-five,\r\nvomitings are rather to be anticipated. Convulsions occur to children\r\nif acute fever be present, and the belly be constipated, if they cannot\r\nsleep, are agitated, and moan, and change color, and become green,\r\nlivid, or ruddy. These complaints occur most readily to children which\r\nare very young up to their seventh year; older children and adults are\r\nnot equally liable to be seized with convulsions in fevers, unless some\r\nof the strongest and worst symptoms precede, such as those which occur\r\nin frenzy. One must judge of children as of others, which will die\r\nand which recover, from the whole of the symptoms, as they have been\r\nspecially described.[517] These things I say respecting acute diseases,\r\nand the affections which spring from them.\r\n\r\n25. He who would know correctly beforehand those that will recover,\r\nand those that will die, and in what cases the disease will be\r\nprotracted for many days, and in what cases for a shorter time, must\r\nbe able to form a judgment from having made himself acquainted with\r\nall the symptoms, and estimating their powers in comparison with one\r\nanother, as has been described, with regard to the others, and the\r\nurine and sputa, as when the patient coughs up pus and bile together.\r\nOne ought also to consider promptly the influx of epidemical diseases\r\nand the constitution of the season.[518] One should likewise be well\r\nacquainted with the particular signs and the other symptoms, and\r\nnot be ignorant how that, in every year, and at every season, bad\r\nsymptoms prognosticate ill, and favorable symptoms good, since the\r\naforesaid symptoms appear to have held true in Libya, in Delos, and in\r\nScythia;[519] from which it may be known that, in the same regions,\r\nthere is no difficulty in attaining a knowledge of many more things\r\nthan these; if having learned them, one knows also how to judge and\r\nreason correctly of them. But you should not complain because the name\r\nof any disease may happen not to be described here, for you may know\r\nall such as come to a crisis in the afore-mentioned times, by the same\r\nsymptoms.[520]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                                  TO\r\n\r\n                       THE BOOK OF PROGNOSTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs announced in the Preliminary Discourse (Sect. II., 18), I shall\r\nnow proceed to give an abstract of the principal matters contained\r\nin the SECOND BOOK OF PRORRHETICS, which appear to me to be\r\nhighly interesting, and as they relate to the subjects treated of in\r\nthe Prognostics, they may be more suitably introduced here than in any\r\nother place.\r\n\r\nThe author commences the treatise with expressing his disapproval of\r\ncertain modes of making prognostics which he had seen practiced. He\r\nsays he had heard of many and famous predictions having been made by\r\nphysicians, such as he himself did not pretend that he could make.\r\nSuch, for example, as for a physician to call in upon a patient who was\r\nlooked upon as being in a desperate condition by another physician, and\r\npredict that he would not die, but would lose his sight. Or to predict\r\nwith regard to another patient supposed to be in a bad way, that he\r\nwill recover, but will become lame of a hand. And of a third who, to\r\nall appearance, cannot recover, to predict that he will get well,\r\nbut that his toes will blacken and putrefy. Similar predictions are\r\nrelated under this class. Another mode of prediction is to prophecy to\r\nbuyers and traders, to one death, to another madness, and to the rest\r\ndiseases, and that from what is now occurring, or has occurred before,\r\nand all the predictions to turn out true. Another kind of predictions\r\nrelates to Athletæ, and those who practice gymnastic and laborious\r\nexercises for the cure of diseases, where the practitioner pretends to\r\nso much exactness, that if the patient is guilty of any act of omission\r\nor commission in regard to food, drink, or venery, the physician\r\nwill detect it. He himself makes no pretensions to any such skill in\r\ndivination, but announces it as his object to describe the symptoms\r\nby which it may be known whether a man will die or live, and whether\r\nhis disease will be of short or of long duration. With regard to the\r\npredictions of abscesses, lameness, death, or madness, the author holds\r\nthat they can only be made after the morbid conditions leading to them\r\nhave fairly set in. He strongly disapproves of all ostentatious modes\r\nof making predictions, and gives it as his advice that in all such\r\ncases the greatest prudence and reserve should be observed, since if a\r\nman become an adept in this art of prognostications, he will gain great\r\ncredit with his patient, whereas if he fall into mistakes, he will\r\nincur odium, and will be looked upon as being deranged.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the prognostics made by those who practice gymnastics,\r\nhe recommends them not to be made in a charlatan manner, but with\r\nsuitable caution, and directs minute attention to be paid to the\r\ncircumstances of the patient, which one has superior advantages in\r\nobserving under this system. He says, for example, that a physician who\r\nfeels a patient’s belly and pulse, pays attention to the breathing at\r\nthe nostrils, and listens to the speech, and sound of the respiration,\r\nwill be less likely to be deceived in forming a prognostic on his\r\npatients than he who neglects these things. He expresses himself,\r\nhowever, as being incredulous as to the possibility of detecting any\r\nlittle transgressions of orders which a patient may commit, although\r\ngreater departures from instructions may be suspected. After some\r\ngeneral observations in respect to diet, and other matters relating to\r\nit, he proceeds to a more circumstantial description of the symptoms\r\nupon which a prognosis is to be founded. And first, with regard to the\r\nalvine dejections, those of persons who live a laborious life, and use\r\nfood and drink sparingly, are small and hard, and are passed every day,\r\nevery third day, or every fourth day, but if they pass the last period\r\nthere is danger of the man’s being seized with fever or diarrhœa. When\r\nthe stools are so liquid that they do not assume a shape, they are all\r\nof a worse character in these cases. The dejections of persons who lead\r\nan active life are less copious than those of the indolent, provided\r\nthey use the same amount of food. Liquid dejections taking place on the\r\nseventh day, and quickly coming to a crisis, are beneficial, if they\r\noccur all at once, and are not repeated. But if accompanied with fever,\r\nor if the diarrhœa is prolonged, all such dejections are bad, whether\r\nbilious, pituitous, or of indigested matters, and require a particular\r\nregimen and mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the urine, it should be in proportion to the drink that\r\nis taken, and somewhat thicker than the fluid that is drunk. If it be\r\nmore copious than natural, this indicates either that the patient has\r\ndisobeyed orders as to the amount of his drink, or that his body is in\r\na state of atrophy. If the urine is passed in deficient quantity, with\r\na noise, it indicates either that the man stands in need of purging, or\r\nthat the bladder is diseased. A small quantity of blood passed without\r\nfever and pain does not indicate anything bad, but proves a solution to\r\na state of lassitude. But if in large quantity, with the addition of\r\nany of these symptoms, it is to be dreaded. But if the urine be passed\r\nwith pain, and if pus be passed along with the urine in a fever, the\r\nphysician should announce that the patient will thus be relieved of his\r\ncomplaints.[521] Thick urine having a thin sediment indicates some pain\r\nand swelling about the joints. All the other sediments which occur in\r\nthe urine of persons who practice exercises are connected with disease\r\nabout the bladder; this will be clearly shown by the obstinate pains\r\nwith which they are accompanied. The author, although he states that he\r\nhad been conversant with the teachers of prognostics from urine, and\r\ntheir children and disciples, seems to express himself doubtful as to\r\nthe possibility of acquiring a great degree of accuracy in regard to\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\nRespecting dropsy, consumption, gout, and epilepsy, he states generally\r\nthat if they are hereditary they are difficult to remove. A favorable\r\nprognosis is to be formed in dropsy when the patient’s viscera are\r\nsound, when his strength is firm, the digestion and respiration\r\nnatural, when he is free of pain, the temperature of the body moderate,\r\nand when there is no wasting of the extremities. It is favorable when\r\nthere is no cough, thirst, nor dryness of the tongue, when the bowels\r\nare easily moved by medicine, and when, at other times, the dejections\r\nare consistent. Dropsy, supervening, along with fever, upon a great\r\ndischarge of blood, is of a most intractable nature, and the physician\r\nshould intimate the danger to some other person beforehand. When great\r\nswellings suddenly subside and rise again, there is more hope in such a\r\ncase than in dropsies connected with a discharge of blood. He concludes\r\nhis observations on dropsies with the remark, that they are apt to\r\ndeceive the patients, so that they desert their physicians and thus\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nWith regard to consumptive patients, he says, he has the same\r\nobservations to make with regard to the sputa and cough as he had\r\nwritten with regard to empyema.[522] If the patient is to recover,\r\nthe sputa should be white, equable, of one color, without phlegm; the\r\ndefluxion from the head should be determined to the nose; there should\r\nbe no fever, nor anorexia, nor thirst; the alvine discharges firm,\r\nproportionate to the ingesta, and the patient should not get thin.\r\nThe best form of the chest is when it is quadrangular and hairy, and\r\nwhen the cartilage is small, and covered with flesh. Young persons,\r\nwho become affected with empyema from determination (metastasis?), or\r\nfistula, or from any other similar cause, or from the retrocession\r\nof an abscess, do not recover unless many of the favorable symptoms\r\ncombine in the case. They die, most commonly, in autumn, which proves\r\npeculiarly fatal in protracted diseases. Of all others, virgins, and\r\nwomen suffering from amenorrhœa, seldomest recover; and in their cases\r\nthere is no hope unless menstruation be restored. All sexes, he seems\r\nto say (but the meaning appears to me rather ambiguous), have a better\r\nchance of recovery, when there is a discharge of blood, especially in\r\nthose cases in which there are pains in the back and chest, connected\r\nwith black bile; and if, after the evacuation, there be a remission\r\nof the pain; if the cough and fever do not set in; and if the thirst\r\nbe tolerable. He seems to state (but the text is in an unsatisfactory\r\ncondition), that relapses take place unless there be deposits in the\r\nplace, the best of which are those which contain most blood; and that\r\nin those cases in which there are pains in the chest, if the patients\r\nget emaciated, and cough, and a dyspnœa supervenes, without fever\r\nor empyema, they should be asked whether, when they cough, and have\r\ndifficulty of breathing, the sputa be compact, and attended with little\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nWith regard to persons affected with the gout, those who are aged,\r\nhave tofi in their joints, who have led a hard life, and whose bowels\r\nare constipated, are beyond the power of medicine to cure. But, the\r\nbest natural remedy for them is an attack of dysentery, or other\r\ndetermination to the bowels. Persons, under opposite circumstances, may\r\nbe cured by a skilful physician.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis in epilepsy is unfavorable when the disease is\r\ncongenital, and when it endures to manhood, and when it occurs to a\r\ngrown person, and without any obvious cause. When connected with the\r\nhead it is particularly to be apprehended, but least so when it seems\r\nto be derived from the hands or feet. The cure may be attempted in\r\nyoung persons, but not in old.\r\n\r\nIn the case of children, he mentions various complaints, such as\r\ndistortion of the eyes, tubercles about the neck, pain in the bowels,\r\nomental hernia, etc., which, upon inquiry, will be found to be the\r\nconsequences of an attack of epilepsy.\r\n\r\nThe judgment to be formed in the case of ulcers is to be founded on the\r\nage of the patient, the situation of the sore, and its appearance.\r\n\r\nStrumous tubercles, which end in suppuration, occur most frequently in\r\nyoung persons. Adults are subject to bad favi, internal cancers, and\r\nherpetic sores, after epinyetis, until they pass sixty. Old persons are\r\nsubject to cancers, both deep-seated and superficial, which never leave\r\nthem. They are particularly intractable when seated in the armpits, the\r\nloins, and the thighs.\r\n\r\nOf affections of the joints, the most dangerous are those seated in the\r\nthumb and great toe. When there is a chronic sore on the side of the\r\ntongue the surgeon should examine whether it be not occasioned by the\r\nsharp edge of a tooth.[523]\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous wounds are those which implicate the large veins\r\n(blood-vessels), in the neck and groin; then those of the brain and\r\nliver; next, those of the bowels and bladder. These cases are all\r\ndangerous, but not uniformly fatal, as some suppose. Much depends upon\r\nconstitution, as to liability to fever and inflammation after a wound.\r\nSometimes, also, the wounds of smaller vessels prove fatal by inducing\r\nhemorrhage, fever, or delirium. In all recent wounds, however, the\r\nphysician should endeavor to afford assistance.\r\n\r\nOf spreading ulcers, the most fatal are such mortifications as are\r\nvery deep, black, and dry; and those are bad and dangerous which are\r\naccompanied with a black ichorous discharge. Those which are white and\r\nmucous are less dangerous, but are more subject to relapse, and become\r\ninveterate. Herpes is the least dangerous of the spreading sores,\r\nbut is most difficult to remove about deep-seated cancers.[524] An\r\nephemeral fever, with very white and thick pus, is beneficial in such a\r\ncase; also, sphacelus of a nerve, of a bone, or of both, in deep-seated\r\nand black mortifications. For a free discharge of pus takes place and\r\ncarries off the mortification.\r\n\r\nThe prognostics in wounds of the head are given in nearly the same\r\nterms as laid down in the treatise on that subject, and therefore I\r\nneed not enter minutely into an exposition of what is stated regarding\r\nthem here. Those in the upper part of the head, more especially if they\r\nimplicate a suture, are said to be particularly dangerous. The author\r\ndirects the surgeon to inquire whether, at the time of the accident,\r\nthe patient fell down or became comatose, as in this case greater\r\ndanger is to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nLarge wounds of the joints, if they involve the connecting nerves,\r\nnecessarily leave the limb maimed. Several other observations connected\r\nwith these injuries are added, of which one of the most important\r\nis the direction to practice flexion and extension of the limb,\r\nfrequently, with the view, no doubt, of preventing rigidity of the\r\njoint.\r\n\r\nLarge excisions in the arm becoming inflamed end in suppurations, which\r\nrequire to be evacuated by the knife or cautery. Injuries of the spinal\r\nmarrow, whether from disease or accident, are attended with loss of\r\nmotion and sensibility, retention of the alvine and urinary discharges;\r\nbut, after a time, involuntary evacuations take place, which are soon\r\nfollowed by death. When the throat is frequently filled with blood,\r\nand there is no headache or cough, nor any other morbid symptoms, the\r\nphysician should examine whether there be not an ulcer or a leech in\r\nthe part.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the eyes, the prognostics are given with so much\r\nprolixity of detail that I must be content with a brief abstract of\r\nthem. Much attention is paid to the characters of the discharge from\r\nthe eyes in diseases of them, namely, of the glutinous matter and\r\ntears; thus, if the gum be white and soft, the tears mixed with it not\r\nvery hot, and the swelling light and loose, under these circumstances\r\nthe eyelids are glued up during the night, so that the eye is free of\r\npain, and thus the disease is without danger, and of short duration.\r\nThe other appearances of the eye, and the discharges, are also minutely\r\ngiven. When the discharge is green or livid, the tears copious and\r\nhot, a burning heat in the head, and pains darting through the head to\r\nthe eye, there must necessarily be ulceration in the eye; and there is\r\nmuch reason to apprehend that it will burst. If, when one can get a\r\nsight of the eye, it should be found burst, and the pupil projecting\r\nabove the rupture, it is bad and difficult to restore; and, if there\r\nbe sloughing, the eye will be wholly useless. According to the form\r\nand depth of the ulcers must be the subsequent cicatrices. These are\r\nminutely described according to their different varieties. Mention is\r\nalso made of the prognostics from the eyes in fevers, as described by\r\nthe author in another work. It is most likely that allusion is here\r\nmade to the first book of “Prorrhetics.” In conclusion, the surgeon is\r\ndirected to pay great attention to the state of the urine in diseases\r\nof the eyes.\r\n\r\nDysenteries, when they set in with fever, alvine discharges of a mixed\r\ncharacter, or with inflammation of the liver, or of the hypochondrium,\r\nor of the stomach, such as are painful, with retention of the food\r\nand thirst, all these are bad; and the more of these symptoms there\r\nare, the greater the danger; and the fewer, the more hope is there of\r\nrecovery. Children from five to ten years of age are the most apt to\r\ndie of this complaint; the other ages less so. Such dysenteries as\r\nare of a beneficial nature, and are attended with blood and scrapings\r\nof the bowels, cease on the seventh, or fourteenth, or twentieth, or\r\nthirtieth day, or within that period. In such cases even a pregnant\r\nwoman may recover and not suffer abortion.\r\n\r\nAll cases of lientery are said to be of a bad character when they are\r\ncontinued and protracted, both day and night, and when the dejections\r\nare either very crude, or black, soft, and fetid; for they occasion\r\nthirst and determine the fluids otherwise than to the bladder, give\r\nrise to ulcerations (aphthæ?) in the mouth, redness and ephelis[525] of\r\nall colors, and at the same time the belly is in a state of ferment,\r\nand has a foul, wrinkled appearance externally. This disease is most\r\nto be dreaded by old persons; it is formidable to men of middle age,\r\nbut less so in the other ages. The indications of cure, it is acutely\r\nstated, are to determine the fluids to the urine, to relieve the body\r\nfrom its atrophy, and change the color of the skin.\r\n\r\nAll the other varieties of diarrhœa without fever are of short\r\nduration and mild; for they will all cease when washed out, or of their\r\nown accord. The discharge may be predicted as about to cease when,\r\nupon touching the belly, there is no movement, and flatulence passes\r\nwith the discharge. Eversion of the gut takes place in the case of\r\nmiddle-aged persons having piles, of children affected with the stone,\r\nand in protracted and intense discharges from the bowels, and of old\r\npersons having mucous concretions (scybalæ?).\r\n\r\nWomen may be judged of whether they are in a fit state for conception\r\nor not by attending to the following circumstances:--In the first place\r\nto their shapes. Women of smaller stature more readily conceive than\r\ntaller persons; the thin than the fat; the white than the ruddy; the\r\ndark than the pale; those who have prominent veins than the contrary.\r\nIn oldish women it is bad to have much flesh, but a good thing to\r\nhave swelled and large breasts. In addition, inquiry should be made\r\nwhether or not the menstruation be regular as to time and quantity.\r\nAnd it should be ascertained whether the uterus be healthy, of a dry\r\ntemperament, and soft; neither in a state of retraction nor prolapsus;\r\nand its mouth neither turned aside, nor too close, nor too open. When\r\nany of these obstructions come in the way, it is impossible that\r\nconception can take place.\r\n\r\nSuch women as cannot conceive, but appear green, without fever, and the\r\nviscera are not in fault; these will say that the head is pained, and\r\nthat the menstrual discharge is vitiated and irregular. But such of\r\nthese as have the proper color, are of a fat habit of body, the veins\r\nare inconspicuous, they have no pains, and the menses either never\r\nappear at all, or are scanty and intense, and this is one of the most\r\ndifficult states of sterility to remove. In other cases the health is\r\nnot to blame, but the fault lies in the position of the womb. The other\r\ncontingencies in this place are attended with pains, discoloration, and\r\nwasting.\r\n\r\nUlceration in the womb from parturition, an abscess of a chronic\r\nnature, or from any other cause, is necessarily accompanied with\r\nfevers, buboes, and pains in the place; and if the lochial discharge\r\nbe also suppressed, all these evils are more intense and inveterate,\r\nalong with pains of the hypochondrium and head. And when the ulcer\r\nheals, the part necessarily is smoother and harder, and the woman is\r\nless adapted for conception. If, however, the ulceration be in the\r\nright side only, the woman may conceive of a female child, or if in\r\nthe left, of a male. When a woman cannot conceive, and fever comes on\r\nwith a slight cough, inquiry should be made whether she has any ulcer\r\nabout the uterus, or any other of the complaints I have described; for\r\nif she has no complaint in that region to account for her loss of flesh\r\nand sterility, it may be expected that she will have vomiting of blood,\r\nand the catamenia will necessarily be suppressed. But if the fever be\r\ncarried off by the evacuation of blood, and if the catamenia appear,\r\nshe will then prove with child. But if looseness of the bowels having a\r\nbad character take place before there is an evacuation of blood, there\r\nis danger lest the woman perish before a vomiting of blood can take\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIn cases of false conception, in which women are deceived by the\r\nnon-appearance of the menses, and by the increase of the belly and\r\nmovement in it, they will be found to have had headache and pains about\r\nthe neck and hypochondria, and there is no milk in the breasts except a\r\nlittle of a watery character. But when the swelling of the womb passes\r\naway they will conceive, unless there be any other impediment. For\r\nthis affection is beneficial in so far as it produces a change in the\r\nuterus, so that afterwards the woman may prove with child. Women with\r\nchild have not these pains unless the headache be habitual to them,\r\nand in addition they have milk in their breasts. Women affected with\r\nchronic discharges are to be asked whether they have pains in the head\r\nand loins, and in the lower part of the belly, and whether their teeth\r\nbe set on edge, and if they have dimness of sight, and noises in their\r\nears. Such women as vomit bile for several days while in a fasting\r\nstate, though they are not with child nor have fever, are to be asked\r\nwhether they have vomited up round lumbrici, and if they say not, they\r\nshould be warned that this will happen to them. This affection happens\r\nprincipally to married women, then to virgins, and less seldom to other\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nPains without fever are not deadly, but mostly prove protracted, and\r\nhave many changes and relapses. Several varieties of headache are\r\ndescribed, and the prognosis in each laid down. The natural cure of\r\nthem is a coryza, a discharge of mucus from the nose, or sneezing.\r\nPains spreading from the head to the neck and back, are relieved by\r\nabscesses, expectoration of pus, hemorrhoids, exanthemata on the body,\r\nor pityriasis on the head.\r\n\r\nHeaviness and pruritus in the head, either in a part or through the\r\nwhole of it, if, on inquiry, they extend to the tip of the tongue,\r\nindicate a confirmed disease, and one difficult to remove. They are\r\nbest removed by the occurrence of an abscess. But those cases which\r\nare accompanied with vertigo are difficult to cure, and are apt to\r\npass into mania. Other diseases in the head, of a very strong and\r\nprotracted character, occur to both men and women, but especially to\r\nyoung persons, and virgins at the season of manhood, and especially at\r\nthe catamenial period. Women, however, are less subject to pruritus and\r\nmelancholic affections than the men, unless the menses have disappeared.\r\n\r\nBoth men and women who have long had a bad color, but not in the form\r\nof jaundice, are subject to headaches, eat stones and earth, and have\r\npiles. Those who have green colors, without decided jaundice, are\r\naffected in like manner, only instead of eating stones and earth, they\r\nare more subject to pains in the hypochondriac region. Persons who are\r\npale for a length of time, and have the face tumid, will be found to\r\nhave headache, or pains about the viscera, or some disease in the anus;\r\nand in most cases, not one, but many, or all these evils make their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nNyctalopia is most apt to attack young persons, either males or\r\nfemales, and to pass off spontaneously on the fortieth day or in seven\r\nmonths, and in some cases it endures for a whole year. Its duration\r\nmay be estimated from the strength of the disease and the age of the\r\npatient. They are relieved by deposits which determine downwards, but\r\nthese rarely occur in youth. Married women and virgins that have the\r\nmenstrual discharge regular are not subject to the complaint. Persons\r\nhaving protracted defluxions of tears who are attacked with nyctalopia,\r\nare to be questioned whether they had any previous complaint in the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSuch persons as have frequent pains in the vertex and temples, without\r\nfever or loss of color, unless they have some other obvious deposit in\r\nthe face, or speak in a rough tone, or have pain in the teeth, may be\r\nexpected to have a hemorrhage from the nose. Those who have bleeding at\r\nthe nose, although they may appear to be otherwise in good health, will\r\nbe found to have enlarged spleen, or pain in the head, or flashes of\r\nlight before their eyes. Most of these patients have both headache and\r\naffection of the spleen.\r\n\r\nThe gums are diseased and the mouth fetid in persons who have enlarged\r\nspleens. But persons who, although they have enlarged spleens, are\r\nexempt from hemorrhages and fœtor of the mouth have malignant ulcers\r\non the legs and black cicatrices. But if they have any obvious deposit\r\nin the countenance, or if their speech be rough, or if they have\r\ntoothache, a hemorrhage from the nose may be expected. Those who have\r\ngreat swellings below the eyes will be found to have enlarged spleens.\r\nAnd if there come on swellings in the feet, and if they appear to be\r\ndropsical, the belly and loins must be attended to.\r\n\r\nDistortions of the countenance, if not sympathetic with some other\r\npart of the body, quickly pass off either spontaneously or by remedial\r\nmeans. The others are of an apoplectic nature. In other cases, when\r\nthe diseased part wastes from want of motion, there can be no relief\r\nafforded. But when wasting does not take place there may be recovery.\r\nWith regard to the time when this may occur, it is to be prognosticated\r\nby attending to the severity of the disease, to its duration, to the\r\nage of the patient, and to the season, it being known that of all\r\ncases the inveterate, and such as are the consequences of repeated\r\nattacks, are the worst, and the most difficult to remove, and those in\r\naged persons. Autumn and winter are more unfavorable seasons for such\r\ncomplaints than spring and summer.\r\n\r\nPains in the shoulder, which, passing down the arms, occasion torpor\r\nand pains, do not usually terminate in deposits, but the patients\r\nget better by vomiting black bile. But when the pains remain in the\r\nshoulders, or extend to the back, the patients are relieved by vomiting\r\npus or black bile. They are to be judged of thus:--If their breathing\r\nbe free, and if they be slender, it is rather to be expected that they\r\nwill vomit black bile. But if they have more difficulty of breathing,\r\nand if there is any unusual color on the countenance, whether reddish\r\nor black, it is to be expected that they will rather spit blood. It\r\nshould also be attended to whether there be swellings on the feet. This\r\ndisease attacks men most violently from forty to sixty years of age. At\r\nthis period of life ischiatic diseases are most troublesome.\r\n\r\nIschiatic diseases are to be thus judged of:--In the case of old\r\npersons, when the torpor and coldness of the loins and legs are very\r\nstrong, and when they lose the power of erections, and the bowels are\r\nnot moved, or with difficulty, and the fæces are passed with much\r\nmucus, the disease will be very protracted, and it should be announced\r\nbeforehand that the disease will not last shorter time than a year\r\nfrom its commencement; and amendment is to be looked for in spring\r\nand summer. Ischiatic diseases are no less painful in young men, but\r\nare of shorter duration, for they pass off in forty days; and neither\r\nis the torpor great, nor is there coldness of the legs and loins. In\r\nthose cases in which the disease is seated in the loins and leg, but\r\nthe patient does not suffer so much as to be confined to bed, examine\r\nwhether any concretions have taken place in the hip-joint, and make\r\ninquiry whether the pain extends to the groin; for if both these\r\nsymptoms be present, the disease will be of long duration. And the\r\nphysician should also inquire whether there be torpor in the thigh, and\r\nif it extend to the ham; and if he says so, he is to be again asked if\r\nit spreads along the leg to the ankle of the foot. Those who confess\r\nto the most of these symptoms are to be told that the limb will be\r\nsometimes hot and sometimes cold; but those persons in whom the pain\r\nleaves the loins, and is turned downwards, are to be encouraged; but\r\nwhen the disease does not leave the hip and loins, such persons are\r\nto be warned that it is to be dreaded. In those cases in which there\r\nare pains and swellings about the joints, and they do not pass off,\r\nafter the manner of gout, you will find the bowels enlarged, and a\r\nwhite sediment in the urine; and, if you inquire, the patient will\r\nadmit that the temples are often pained, and he will say that he has\r\nnightly sweats. If the urine have not this sediment, nor do the sweats\r\ntake place, there is danger either that the joints will become lame,\r\nor that the tumor called meliceris will form in it. This disease forms\r\nin those persons who in their youth had epistaxis, and in whom it\r\nhad ceased afterwards. They are to be interrogated whether they had\r\ndischarges of blood in their youth, and if they have pruritus in the\r\nbreast and back. And the same thing happens to those who have severe\r\npains in the bowels, without disorder of them, or who have hemorrhoids.\r\nThis is the origin of these complaints. But if the patients have a\r\nbad color, they are to be interrogated whether their head be pained,\r\nfor they will say that it is. In those cases in which the bowels are\r\npained on the right side, the pains are stronger, and especially when\r\nthe pain terminates in the hypochondrium at the liver. Such pains are\r\nimmediately relieved if borborygmi take place in the belly. But when\r\nthe pain ceases, they pass thick and green urine. The disease is not\r\ndeadly, but very protracted. But when the disease is already of long\r\nstanding, the patients have dimness of sight in consequence of it.\r\nBut they are to be interrogated whether, when young, they had a flow\r\nof blood, and regarding the dimness of vision, the greenness of the\r\nurinary discharge, and regarding the borborygmi, if they took place and\r\ngave relief; for they will confess to all these symptoms.\r\n\r\nLichen, leprosy, and leucè, when they occur in young children and\r\ninfants, or when they appear at first small, and gradually increase\r\nin the course of a long time--in these cases the eruption is not to\r\nbe regarded as a deposit, but as a disease; but when they set in rank\r\nand suddenly, this case is a deposit. Leucè also arises from the most\r\nfatal diseases, such as the disease called phthisis;[526] but leprosy\r\nand lichen are connected with black bile. These complaints are the more\r\neasily cured the more recent they are, and the younger the patients,\r\nand the more soft and fleshy the parts of the body in which they occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ON REGIMEN IN ACUTE DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nIn this treatise two very important questions are discussed: first, a\r\nnosological question, regarding the proper distinction of diseases from\r\none another; and secondly, a therapeutical, respecting the rules by\r\nwhich the regimen in acute diseases ought to be regulated. The former\r\nof these is of a polemical nature, being an attack directed against\r\nthe physicians of the Cnidian school of medicine, who distinguished\r\ndiseases from one another in an arbitrary manner, from incidental\r\nvarieties in their constitution, and without proper attention to their\r\ntrue constitution and identity. As will be seen in the annotations, the\r\nCnidians pretended to recognize several varieties of disease connected\r\nwith bile,--several fanciful divisions of diseases of the bladder,\r\nand so forth; to which mode of distinguishing diseases there would\r\nobviously be no end, since of incidental varieties in any case there\r\ncan be no limit. The other question discussed in this treatise relates\r\nto what may justly be pronounced to be one of the most important points\r\nconnected with the practice of medicine, namely, the proper regimen\r\nin acute diseases; that is to say, in idiopathic fevers and febrile\r\ndiseases, comprising most of those diseases now classed under the head\r\nof _Zymotic_, and which constitute by far the highest item in\r\nour bills of mortality at the present day. Our author distinguishes\r\nthem by the names of pleurisy, pneumonia, phrenitis, lethargy, causus,\r\nand their cognate diseases, including fever of the continual type.\r\nNow it is to be borne in mind, that the phrenitis,[527] lethargy, and\r\ncausus of Hippocrates, were all epidemic fevers, so that, with the\r\nexception of pleurisy and pneumonia, all the diseases here treated of\r\nare fevers of the country in which Hippocrates resided. One, then,\r\ncannot well imagine a question which from the commencement of the\r\nmedical Art must have been felt of higher importance than this,--how\r\nso numerous and formidable a class of diseases ought to be treated. In\r\nthe attempt to solve it, every imaginable mode of treatment, as might\r\nhave been expected beforehand, was tried, and its effects determined\r\nby experience. Herodicus, the master of Hippocrates in gymnastics,\r\napplied his panacea in the treatment of febrile diseases, and, as we\r\nare informed, with the most disastrous results. “Herodicus,” says the\r\nauthor of the sixth Book of Epidemics, “killed persons in fever by\r\npromenading, much wrestling, and fomentations.” (§ iii., 18.) It may\r\n_now_ appear wonderful that so extraordinary a mode of practice\r\nshould have ever been attempted in this case; but while men of all\r\nranks continue to resort for the cure of all sorts of diseases to any\r\nindividual who has got a single hobby with which he constantly works to\r\nhis own profit, whether it be _gymnastics_, or _shampooing_,\r\nor the _wet sheet_, we may expect to hear that such rash\r\nexperiments have been repeated. Truly mankind pay as dearly for their\r\ntame submission to the insane practices of professional chiefs, as the\r\nGreeks are represented by the poet to have suffered from the follies of\r\ntheir princes:\r\n\r\n    “Quicquid delirant Reges, plectuntur Achivi.”[528]\r\n\r\nAnd surely it is much to be desired that men would learn a lesson from\r\nthe Past, and not allow every new page in the history of society and of\r\nthe profession to furnish a repetition of the oft-told tale of supine\r\ncredulity on the one side, and of audacious folly on the other. From\r\nwhat has been stated, it will readily be understood that it was soon\r\nsettled that active exercise is inadmissible in febrile diseases.[529]\r\nIt would next come to be determined, what rule was to be followed with\r\nregard to the administration of food in fevers. On this point, as will\r\nbe seen below in our annotations, the most diametrically opposite plans\r\nof treatment were essayed. One authority administered the most highly\r\nnutritious articles of food, namely, fleshes, to his patients, while,\r\non the other hand, some wasted them by enforcing a total abstinence\r\nfor several days. Experience, we may be well assured, was not long in\r\ndeciding against both the starving and the glutting system: the palled\r\nappetite would soon refuse to accept of solids, and the parched tongue\r\nwould speedily crave some allowance of liquids. Even before the days\r\nof Hippocrates, there is every reason to suppose that these extreme\r\nmodes of treatment had been abandoned; but still he complains that\r\nin his time many important points in the treatment of acute diseases\r\nwere wholly undetermined, such as the following: whether plain drink,\r\nthat is to say water, was to be administered;--or, water seasoned\r\nby the admixture of something farinaceous, such as the decoction of\r\nbarley;--whether the same should be given so thick as to constitute a\r\nnutritious gruel, or strained so as to form merely a drink;--whether\r\nwine should be given in small quantity, or more copiously;--whether any\r\nof these things should be given from the commencement of the disease,\r\nor not until after an interval of certain days. Hippocrates informs us\r\nthat the most discordant opinions prevailed upon these points, and his\r\nprofessed object, in this treatise, is to reduce the rules of practice\r\nto certain fixed principles. How our author performs this task, the\r\nreader is left to judge for himself; it may be interesting, however,\r\nto know, that Galen with all his devoted admiration of Hippocrates,\r\nis not disposed to admit that his solution of the question at issue\r\nis quite lucid and satisfactory. This opinion Galen pronounces on two\r\nseparate occasions; in his commentary on this treatise, and in his\r\ngreat Work “On the Tenets of Hippocrates and Plato.” As I look upon his\r\nobservations contained in the latter Work to be of great importance\r\ntoward understanding the bearing of this treatise, I shall not scruple\r\nto introduce a translation of the greater part of them in this place.\r\n\r\nThe ninth book of the Work we have mentioned opens with an elaborate\r\ndisquisition on the logical principles which ought to guide us in\r\ndeciding with regard to identity and difference, both in Philosophy and\r\nMedicine: on the former of these subjects he quotes freely from Plato,\r\nand on the other from Hippocrates. Coming, then, to the question in\r\nhand, he says:--“And thus Hippocrates proceeded in the work ‘On the\r\nRegimen of Acute Diseases,’ finding fault with the Cnidian physicians,\r\nas being ignorant of the differences of diseases with regard to genus\r\nand species; and he himself points out the definitions according to\r\nwhich that which appears to be one, being divided becomes many, not\r\nonly in the case of diseases, but also in that of all other things; in\r\nwhich we find that many of the most celebrated physicians fall into\r\nmistakes, even with regard to the remedies. For some, coming to the\r\nparticular use of them, have established a most immethodical method\r\nof instruction; whilst others, stating a very general precept, lay\r\ndown a rule which at first sight appears very methodical, but in truth\r\nis very bad, and hence they disagree among themselves; some, as for\r\nexample those treating of the remedy for a certain affection, such\r\nas pleurisy, declaring it to be venesection, others purging, some\r\nfomentations by means of sponges, and others of bags, or something\r\nof the like kind. And they differ, in the same manner, with regard\r\nto the use and disuse of the bath, of oxymel, of hydromel, and of\r\nwater, of wine, and of ptisan, either giving of the strained juice\r\nonly, or of the barley portion only; and some, with regard to food,\r\ngiving discordant decisions as to the differences of the sick, and\r\nthe indications which a pleuritic affection requires. And that he, as\r\nbeing the first discoverer, has handled these subjects in rather a\r\nconfused manner, I have shown in my Commentary on the treatise which\r\nhas been improperly entitled, ‘Against the Cnidian Sentences,’ and ‘On\r\nthe Ptisan.’ But in order that those who are desirous of learning,\r\nmay have a clear exposition of this question in a brief form, I\r\nshall not scruple to give here a summary of it. In the commencement\r\nof pleuritic attacks, when the side is just beginning to be pained,\r\ninasmuch as the nature of the disease is not yet obvious, he directs\r\nfomentations, otherwise called heating applications, to be tried,\r\nand he explains the materials of which they consist. And then, if\r\nthe complaint is not removed, it is to be ascertained whether the\r\npatient took food recently, and whether the bowels have been moved,\r\nand he gives instructions what should be done in these cases. But\r\nif the disease does not yield to these means, he gives definitions\r\nof those cases which require venesection and purging, and those in\r\nwhich one should use hydromel for drink, or oxymel, or water until\r\nthe crisis, without giving any food; and those in which the juice of\r\nptisan is to be used, or the barley along with it, and when food is to\r\nbe administered. In like manner, with regard to the administration of\r\nwine, it is determined in what cases it is to be given, and in what\r\nnot, and when, and of what quality. And in like manner respecting\r\nbaths, and other matters of the like kind. And as a twofold mistake\r\nis committed with regard to the divisions (of diseases), some doing\r\nit in a deficient manner, and others carrying this process to excess,\r\nHippocrates, finding fault with both, expresses himself thus, in the\r\nbeginning of the book: ‘Some of them, indeed, were not ignorant of the\r\nmany varieties of each complaint, and their manifold division, but when\r\nthey wish to tell clearly the members (species?) of each disease, they\r\ndo not write correctly; for the species would be almost innumerable\r\nif every symptom experienced by the patients were held to constitute\r\na disease, and receive a different name.’ And again, respecting the\r\nremedies, as being deficient, he writes thus: ‘And not only do I not\r\ngive them credit on this account, but also because those they use are\r\nfew in number.’ Afterwards, assuming what is of great importance to the\r\nquestion, he does not give a clear solution of it, and therefore the\r\nwhole bearing of the question is misunderstood by many physicians. I\r\nhave, therefore, given an exposition of the whole subject, in my first\r\nCommentary ‘On the Regimen of Acute Diseases;’ and it is necessary to\r\nshow the import of it briefly. The question is given by Hippocrates\r\nin the following terms: ‘But it appears to me that those things are\r\nmore especially deserving of being consigned to writing, which are\r\nundetermined by physicians, notwithstanding that they are of vital\r\nimportance, and either do much good or much harm. By undetermined, I\r\nmean such as those: wherefore certain physicians, during their whole\r\nlives, are constantly administering untrained ptisans, and fancy they\r\nthus accomplish the cure properly, whereas others take great pains\r\nthat the patient may not swallow a particle of the barley (thinking it\r\nwould do much harm), but strain the juice through a cloth before giving\r\nit: others, again, will neither give thick ptisan nor the juice, some\r\nuntil the seventh day of the disease, and some until after the crisis.\r\nPhysicians are not in the practice of mooting such questions, nor\r\nperhaps, if mooted, would a solution of them be readily found, although\r\nthe whole Art is thereby exposed to much censure from the vulgar, who\r\nfancy that really there is no such science as Medicine, since, in\r\nacute diseases, practitioners differ so much among themselves, that\r\nthose things which one administers, as thinking it the best that can\r\nbe given, another holds to be bad.’ And a little afterwards: ‘I say,\r\nthen, that this question is a most excellent one, and allied to very\r\nmany others, and some of the most vital importance in the Art: for,\r\nthat it can contribute much to the recovery of the sick, and to the\r\npreservation of health in the case of those who use it well, and that\r\nit promotes the strength of those who take gymnastic exercises, and is\r\nuseful to whatever one may wish to apply it.’ The inquiry regarding\r\nthe differences of opinion among practitioners, he says, is of the\r\ngreatest consequence, not only to the sick, for the recovery of health,\r\nbut also to those in health, for the preservation of it, and to those\r\nwho practise it for the recovery and preservation of deportment. And\r\nhe afterwards adds, ‘to whatever one may wish;’ as indicating that\r\nthe solution of this inquiry is applicable not only to medicine but\r\nto all the other arts to which one may choose to apply it. For it is\r\nwonderful that physicians practising an art, in which the remedies\r\napplied may be determined by experience whether they are beneficial or\r\nhurtful, should yet make the most conflicting statements respecting\r\nthose things which are beneficial and those which are prejudicial. For,\r\nin philosophy, it is not to be wondered at that there should be no end\r\nto most disputes, since these things cannot be clearly determined by\r\nexperience; and therefore some hold that the world is uncreated, some\r\nthat it was created, some that there is nothing beyond its boundary,\r\nsome that there is, and some declaring what that which is contained\r\nis, and some pronouncing it to be a vacuum, having no substance in it,\r\nand some holding that worlds in inconceivable numbers, and infinite,\r\nexist. For such discrepancy of opinion cannot be set at rest by any\r\nclear appeal to the senses. But it is not so with respect to the\r\nbenefit or injury derived from remedies administered to the body,\r\nsince the differences among physicians, in this case, may be decided\r\nby experience, as to which of them are beneficial and which injurious.\r\nWherefore the solution of this question is not very clearly stated by\r\nHippocrates, and on that account it has excited the observation of\r\nalmost all the commentators on this book. It is this: some of the sick\r\nrequire abstinence from food, until the disease come to a crisis, and\r\nsome require food, and of these some require the unstrained ptisan,\r\nand some the strained, as also some require still more substantial\r\nfood, and, moreover, some require oxmyel, or hydromel, and some water,\r\nor wine. Wherefore to those physicians who have cultivated the Art\r\nupon experience alone, that only appears beneficial which perchance\r\nhas seemed useful in most cases. Neither do they venture to try the\r\nopposite mode of regimen, for fear of failure. He alone, then, who\r\nknows the constitution of the sick, and the nature of the disease, and\r\nthe powers of the remedy which is administered, and the time in which\r\nit ought to be used, will be able rationally to devise the remedy to be\r\napplied, and confirm his expectation of it by experience.”\r\n\r\nGalen gives other remarks, not devoid of interest, on the same subject,\r\nbut these want of room obliges me to pass by. I may mention, however,\r\nthat after giving, in the form of extract, the passage on wine (§ 12),\r\nhe makes the remark, that if the question be put whether wine should be\r\ngiven to persons in fever, the proper answer to it would be, that it is\r\nto be given in some certain cases, and in others not. (See tom. v., p.\r\n773, ed. Kühn.) Thus far Galen.\r\n\r\nBefore quitting this subject, I would beg leave to make a few remarks\r\non some points of medical practice which are here treated of, and\r\nwhich appear to me to be either overlooked, or not satisfactorily\r\ndetermined at the present day; and also upon some modern innovations on\r\nthe practice of the ancients. As far as I have observed, it is quite\r\na common practice now to administer food, such as farinaceous gruels,\r\nor animal broths, without much reserve, after evacuation of the system\r\neither by purging or bleeding. Now it will be seen that Hippocrates\r\nforbids food to be administered at such a season, as the body, being\r\nweakened by the depletion, is unable to digest it properly, and\r\nconsequently what is given as a support to the frame proves a load to\r\nit. To the reason here assigned for this practice, might be added that\r\nthe vascular system, having been emptied, greedily absorbs the food\r\nbefore it is properly digested. I am not sure that this physiological\r\nprinciple is stated in any of the works of Hippocrates, but it is\r\nfrequently to be met with in the works of Galen, and in those of the\r\ntoxicologists, from Nicander to Actuarius. See PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nBook V., 2, Syd. Soc. edit.\r\n\r\nI would beg leave to call the attention of my professional readers\r\nto the guarded and judicious manner in which pleurisy is treated by\r\nour author, beginning with hot fomentations to the side, and gradually\r\nadvancing to the more active means, namely, purging and venesection.\r\nIt will be remarked that Hippocrates holds depletion to be the only\r\nlegitimate mode of removing the pain of the side, and that his\r\ncommentator, in illustration of his meaning, pointedly condemns the use\r\nof narcotics in this case. Now this is a most important consideration,\r\nas bearing on a mode of practice which has obtained much favor of\r\nlate years; I allude, of course, to the treatment by a combination of\r\nmercurials and opium. The experience of some thirty years would seem to\r\ndecide in its favor, but how often have certain methods of treatment\r\nin other cases obtained the sanction of professional favor for a\r\nmuch longer period, and yet in the end been abandoned as positively\r\nprejudicial? In my younger days I knew old practitioners, of the\r\nhighest reputation, who administered these medicines in scrofula,--in\r\ncancer,--in every case! One cannot think of the changes in professional\r\nopinions on the mercurial treatment of syphilis, since the days of John\r\nHunter, without the most painful feeling of distrust in all modes of\r\ntreatment where one cannot recognize some reasonable bond of connection\r\nbetween the remedy applied and the effects produced, or where long\r\nexperience and analogy are in favor of them, and where the judgment\r\nruns no risk of being imposed upon by fallacious appearances and\r\ncollateral circumstances. In a word, who does not feel disposed, in the\r\npractice of medicine, constantly to recur to the great truth proclaimed\r\nby our author in his first Aphorism? “Experience is fallacious, and\r\njudgment is difficult.”\r\n\r\nI am almost afraid further to put the question to the profession of\r\nthe present day, whether or not the administration of antimonials in\r\npleuro-pneumonia be an improvement on the ancient practice, or the\r\nreverse? Shall we say, then, that experience has decided that this\r\nsubstance (antimony), which, when applied to the cuticle, or to its\r\nprolongation, the epithelium of the stomach and bowels, occasions pain,\r\nheat, and vascular congestion, produces the very opposite effects\r\non the lungs, when absorbed into the blood and conveyed to them? I\r\ndare not venture to answer these questions myself, but suggest them\r\nas deserving to be reconsidered, with serious impartiality, by the\r\nprofession. I trust, however, it will not be supposed that I incline\r\nto stand up for ancient modes of practice, because they are old, or\r\nto condemn modern methods because they are new; I merely state the\r\nreflections which the comparison of ancient and modern usages, on this\r\nimportant subject, has suggested to me.\r\n\r\nOur author, it will be seen, attaches much importance to the\r\nadministration of the ptisan, or decoction of barley, in\r\npleuro-pneumonia. Our modern Hippocrates, I mean, of course, Sydenham,\r\nwas equally partial to this practice,[530] which is still very much\r\nfollowed on the continent.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked, that Hippocrates says nothing of counter-irritants\r\nto the skin, in the treatment of pleurisy, all his external\r\napplications being of the soothing kind. The stimulant treatment,\r\nhowever, is not altogether modern, having been recommended in certain\r\ncases by the Arabians. (See PAULUS ÆEGINETA, Vol. I., p. 501.)\r\nCelsus also approves of sinapisms to the side. (iv., 6.)\r\n\r\nThe use of the bath and of the _douche_, or affusion of hot water\r\nin febrile diseases, is an important question, which well deserves to\r\nbe reconsidered by the profession. (See the annotations on § 18.)\r\n\r\nThe reader will no doubt have been struck with the remark of Galen,\r\nin the extract given above, that our author’s plan in the present work\r\nis deficient in method, because he himself was the discoverer of the\r\nsubject-matters to which it relates. Galen then seems to have been of\r\nopinion that it was too much to expect from any individual, that he\r\nshould produce a work which would be remarkable at the same time for\r\nthe originality of its materials, and for the methodical arrangement of\r\nthem. In confirmation of Galen’s judgment in this case, I would direct\r\nattention to the difference that there is between this treatise and the\r\n“Prognostics;” for all must admit that the matters of which the latter\r\nwork is composed are admirably methodized, and we have shown above that\r\nthey were derived in a great measure from the previous labors of the\r\nAsclepiadæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nON REGIMEN IN ACUTE DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThose who composed what are called “The Cnidian Sentences”[531]\r\nhave described accurately what symptoms the sick experience in every\r\ndisease, and how certain of them terminate; and in so far a man, even\r\nwho is not a physician, might describe them correctly, provided he\r\nput the proper inquiries to the sick themselves what their complaints\r\nare. But those symptoms which the physician ought to know beforehand\r\nwithout being informed of them by the patient, are, for the most part,\r\nomitted, some in one case and some in others, and certain symptoms of\r\nvital importance for a conjectural judgment.[532] But when, in addition\r\nto the diagnosis, they describe how each complaint should be treated,\r\nin these cases I entertain a still greater difference of opinion with\r\nthem respecting the rules they have laid down; and not only do I not\r\nagree with them on this account, but also because the remedies they use\r\nare few in number; for, with the exception of acute diseases, the only\r\nmedicines which they give are drastic purgatives, with whey, and milk\r\nat certain times. If, indeed, these remedies had been good and suitable\r\nto the complaints in which they are recommended, they would have been\r\nstill more deserving of recommendation, if, while few in number, they\r\nwere sufficient; but this is by no means the case. Those, indeed,\r\nwho have remodeled these “Sentences” have treated of the remedies\r\napplicable in each complaint more in a medical fashion. But neither\r\nhave the ancients written anything worth mentioning respecting regimen,\r\nalthough this be a great omission. Some of them, indeed, were not\r\nignorant of the many varieties of each complaint, and their manifold\r\ndivisions, but when they wish to tell clearly the numbers (species?) of\r\neach disease they do not write correctly;[533] for their species would\r\nbe almost innumerable if every symptom experienced by the patients were\r\nheld to constitute a disease, and receive a different name.[534]\r\n\r\n2. For my part, I approve of paying attention to everything relating\r\nto the art, and that those things which can be done well or properly\r\nshould all be done properly; such as can be quickly done should be\r\ndone quickly; such as can be neatly done should be done neatly; such\r\noperations as can be performed without pain should be done with the\r\nleast possible pain; and that all other things of the like kind should\r\nbe done better than they could be managed by the attendants. But I\r\nwould more especially commend the physician who, in acute diseases,\r\nby which the bulk of mankind are cut off, conducts the treatment\r\nbetter than others. Acute diseases are those which the ancients\r\nnamed pleurisy, pneumonia, phrenitis, lethargy, causus, and the\r\nother diseases allied to these, including the continual fevers. For,\r\nunless when some general form of pestilential disease is epidemic,\r\nand diseases are sporadic and [not] of a similar character, there\r\nare more deaths from these diseases than from all the others taken\r\ntogether.[535] The vulgar, indeed, do not recognize the difference\r\nbetween such physicians and their common attendants, and are rather\r\ndisposed to commend and censure extraordinary remedies. This, then,\r\nis a great proof that the common people are most incompetent, of\r\nthemselves, to form a judgment how such diseases should be treated:\r\nsince persons who are not physicians pass for physicians owing most\r\nespecially to these diseases, for it is an easy matter to learn the\r\nnames of those things which are applicable to persons laboring under\r\nsuch complaints. For, if one names the juice of ptisan, and such and\r\nsuch a wine, and hydromel, the vulgar fancy that he prescribes exactly\r\nthe same things as the physicians do, both the good and the bad, but in\r\nthese matters there is a great difference between them.\r\n\r\n3. But it appears to me that those things are more especially\r\ndeserving of being consigned to writing which are undetermined by\r\nphysicians, notwithstanding that they are of vital importance, and\r\neither do much good or much harm. By undetermined I mean such as these,\r\nwherefore certain physicians, during their whole lives, are constantly\r\nadministering unstrained ptisans, and fancy they thus accomplish the\r\ncure properly, whereas others take great pains that the patient should\r\nnot swallow a particle of the barley (thinking it would do much harm),\r\nbut strain the juice through a cloth before giving it; others, again,\r\nwill neither give thick ptisan nor the juice, some until the seventh\r\nday of the disease, and some until after the crisis.[536] Physicians\r\nare not in the practice of mooting such questions; nor, perhaps, if\r\nmooted, would a solution of them be found; although the whole art is\r\nthereby exposed to much censure from the vulgar, who fancy that there\r\nreally is no such science as medicine, since, in acute diseases,\r\npractitioners differ so much among themselves, that those things which\r\none administers as thinking it the best that can be given, another\r\nholds to be bad; and, in this respect, they might say that the art\r\nof medicine resembles augury, since augurs hold that the same bird\r\n(omen) if seen on the left hand is good, but if on the right bad: and\r\nin divination by the inspection of entrails you will find similar\r\ndifferences; but certain diviners hold the very opposite of these\r\nopinions.[537] I say, then, that this question is a most excellent one,\r\nand allied to very many others, some of the most vital importance in\r\nthe Art, for that it can contribute much to the recovery of the sick,\r\nand to the preservation of health in the case of those who are well;\r\nand that it promotes the strength of those who use gymnastic exercises,\r\nand is useful to whatever one may wish to apply it.\r\n\r\n4. Ptisan, then, appears to me to be justly preferred before all\r\nthe other preparations from grain in these diseases, and I commend\r\nthose who made this choice,[538] for the mucilage of it is smooth,\r\nconsistent, pleasant, lubricant, moderately diluent, quenches thirst\r\nif this be required, and has no astringency; gives no trouble nor\r\nswells up in the bowels, for in the boiling it swells up as much as it\r\nnaturally can. Those, then, who make use of ptisan in such diseases,\r\nshould never for a day allow their vessels to be empty of it, if I may\r\nsay so, but should use it and not intermit, unless it be necessary to\r\nstop for a time, in order to administer medicine or a clyster. And\r\nto those who are accustomed to take two meals in the day it is to be\r\ngiven twice, and to those accustomed to live upon a single meal it is\r\nto be given once at first, and then, if the case permit, it is to be\r\nincreased and given twice to them, if they appear to stand in need of\r\nit. At first it will be proper not to give a large quantity nor very\r\nthick, but in proportion to the quantity of food which one has been\r\naccustomed to take, and so as that the veins may not be much emptied.\r\nAnd, with regard to the augmentation of the dose, if the disease be of\r\na drier nature than one had supposed,[539] one must not give more of\r\nit, but should give before the draught of ptisan, either hydromel or\r\nwine, in as great quantity as may be proper; and what is proper in each\r\ncase will be afterward stated by us. But if the mouth and the passages\r\nfrom the lungs be in a proper state as to moisture, the quantity of\r\nthe draught is to be increased, as a general rule, for an early and\r\nabundant state of moisture indicates an early crisis, but a late and\r\ndeficient moisture indicates a slower crisis.[540] And these things are\r\nas I have stated for the most part; but many other things are omitted\r\nwhich are important to the prognosis, as will be explained afterwards.\r\nAnd the more that the patient is troubled with purging, in so much\r\ngreater quantity is it to be given until the crisis, and moreover until\r\ntwo days beyond the crisis, in such cases as it appears to take place\r\non the fifth, seventh, or ninth day, so as to have respect both for the\r\nodd and even day; after this the draught is to be given early in the\r\nday, and the other food in place is to be given in the evening. These\r\nthings are proper, for the most part, to be given to those who, from\r\nthe first, have used ptisan containing its whole substance; for the\r\npains in pleuritic affections immediately cease of their own accord\r\nwhenever the patients begin to expectorate anything worth mentioning,\r\nand the purgings become much better, and empyema much more seldom takes\r\nplace, than if the patients used a different regimen, and the crises\r\nare more simple, occur earlier, and the cases are less subject to\r\nrelapses.\r\n\r\n5. Ptisans are to be made of the very best barley, and are to be well\r\nboiled, more especially if you do not intend to use them strained. For,\r\nbesides the other virtues of ptisan, its lubricant quality prevents\r\nthe barley that is swallowed from proving injurious, for it does not\r\nstick nor remain in the region of the breast; for that which is well\r\nboiled is very lubricant, excellent for quenching thirst, of very easy\r\ndigestion, and very weak, all which qualities are wanted. If, then, one\r\ndo not pay proper attention to the mode of administering the ptisan,\r\nmuch harm may be done; for when the food is shut up in the bowels,\r\nunless one procure some evacuation speedily, before administering\r\nthe draught, the pain, if present, will be exasperated; and, if not\r\npresent, it will be immediately created, and the respiration will\r\nbecome more frequent, which does mischief, for it dries the lungs,\r\nfatigues the hypochondria, the hypogastrium, and diaphragm. And\r\nmoreover if, while the pain of the side persists, and does not yield\r\nto warm fomentations, and the sputa are not brought up, but are viscid\r\nand unconcocted, unless one get the pain resolved, either by loosening\r\nthe bowels; or opening a vein, whichever of these may be proper;--if\r\nto persons so circumstanced ptisan be administered, their speedy\r\ndeath will be the result.[541] For these reasons, and for others of a\r\nsimilar kind still more, those who use unstrained ptisan die on the\r\nseventh day, or still earlier, some being seized with delirium, and\r\nothers dying suffocated with orthopnœa and râles.[542] Such persons\r\nthe ancients thought _struck_, for this reason more especially,\r\nthat when dead the affected side was livid, like that of a person who\r\nhad been struck. The cause of this is that they die before the pain is\r\nresolved, being seized with difficulty of respiration, and by large and\r\nrapid breathing, as has been already explained, the spittle becoming\r\nthick, acid, and unconcocted, cannot be brought up, but, being retained\r\nin the bronchi of the lungs, produces râles; and, when it has come to\r\nthis, death, for the most part, is inevitable; for the sputa being\r\nretained prevent the breath from being drawn in, and force it speedily\r\nout, and thus the two conspire together to aggravate the mischief;\r\nfor the sputa being retained renders the respiration frequent, while\r\nthe respiration being frequent thickens the sputa, and prevents them\r\nfrom being evacuated. These symptoms supervene, not only if ptisan be\r\nadministered unseasonably, but still more if any other food or drink\r\nworse than ptisan be given.\r\n\r\n6. For the most part, then, the results are the same, whether the\r\npatient have used the unstrained ptisan or have used the juice alone;\r\nor even only drink; and sometimes it is necessary to proceed quite\r\ndifferently. In general, one should do thus: if fever commences shortly\r\nafter taking food, and before the bowels have been evacuated, whether\r\nwith or without pain, the physician ought to withhold the draught until\r\nhe thinks that the food has descended to the lower part of the belly;\r\nand if any pain be present, the patient should use oxymel, hot if it\r\nis winter, and cold if it is summer; and, if there be much thirst, he\r\nshould take hydromel and water.[543] Then, if any pain be present, or\r\nany dangerous symptoms make their appearance, it will be proper to give\r\nthe draught neither in large quantity nor thick, but after the seventh\r\nday, if the patient be strong. But if the earlier-taken food has not\r\ndescended, in the case of a person who has recently swallowed food, and\r\nif he be strong and in the vigor of life, a clyster should be given, or\r\nif he be weaker, a suppository is to be administered, unless the bowels\r\nopen properly of themselves. The time for administering the draught is\r\nto be particularly observed at the commencement and during the whole\r\nillness; when, then, the feet are cold, one should refrain from giving\r\nthe ptisan, and more especially abstain from drink; but when the heat\r\nhas descended to the feet, one may then give it; and one should look\r\nupon this season as of great consequence in all diseases, and not least\r\nin acute diseases, especially those of a febrile character, and those\r\nof a very dangerous nature. One may first use the juice, and then the\r\nptisan, attending accurately to the rules formerly laid down.\r\n\r\n7. When pain seizes the side, either at the commencement or at a\r\nlater stage, it will not be improper to try to dissolve the pain by\r\nhot applications.[544] Of hot applications the most powerful is hot\r\nwater in a bottle, or bladder, or in a brazen vessel, or in an earthen\r\none; but one must first apply something soft to the side, to prevent\r\npain. A soft large sponge, squeezed out of hot water and applied, forms\r\na good application; but it should be covered up above, for thus the\r\nheat will remain the longer, and at the same time the vapor will be\r\nprevented from being carried up to the patient’s breath, unless when\r\nthis is thought of use, for sometimes it is the case. And further,\r\nbarley or tares may be infused and boiled in diluted vinegar, stronger\r\nthan that it could be drunk, and may then be sewed into bladders and\r\napplied; and one may use bran in like manner. Salts or toasted millet\r\nin woolen bags are excellent for forming a dry fomentation, for the\r\nmillet is light and soothing. A soft fomentation like this soothes\r\npains, even such as shoot to the clavicle. Venesection, however, does\r\nnot alleviate the pain unless when it extends to the clavicle. But\r\nif the pain be not dissolved by the fomentations, one ought not to\r\nfoment for a length of time, for this dries the lungs and promotes\r\nsuppuration; but if the pain point to the clavicle, or if there be a\r\nheaviness in the arm, or about the breast, or above the diaphragm, one\r\nshould open the inner vein at the elbow, and not hesitate to abstract\r\na large quantity, until it become much redder, or instead of being\r\npure red, it turns livid,[545] for both these states occur. But if\r\nthe pain be below the diaphragm, and do not point to the clavicle, we\r\nmust open the belly either with black hellebore[546] or peplium,[547]\r\nmixing the black hellebore with carrot or seseli,[548] or cumin, or\r\nanise, or any other of the fragrant herbs; and with the peplium the\r\njuice of sulphium[549] (asafœtida), for these substances, when mixed up\r\ntogether, are of a similar nature.[550] The black hellebore acts more\r\npleasantly and effectually than the peplium, while, on the other hand,\r\nthe peplium expels wind much more effectually than the black hellebore,\r\nand both these stop the pain, and many other of the laxatives also\r\nstop it, but these two are the most efficacious that I am acquainted\r\nwith. And the laxatives given in draughts are beneficial, when not\r\nvery unpalatable owing to bitterness, or any other disagreeable taste,\r\nor from quantity, colour, or any apprehension. When the patient has\r\ndrunk the medicine, one ought to give him to swallow but little\r\nless of the ptisan than what he had been accustomed to; but it is\r\naccording to rule not to give any draughts while the medicine is under\r\noperation;[551] but when the purging is stopped then he should take a\r\nsmaller draught than what he had been accustomed to, and afterwards go\r\non increasing it progressively, until the pain cease, provided nothing\r\nelse contra-indicate. This is my rule, also, if one would use the juice\r\nof ptisan, (for I hold that it is better, on the whole, to begin with\r\ntaking the decoction at once, rather than by first emptying the veins\r\nbefore doing so, or on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh day,\r\nprovided the disease has not previously come to a crisis in the course\r\nof this time), and similar preparations to those formerly described are\r\nto be made in those cases.\r\n\r\n8. Such are the opinions which I entertain respecting the administering\r\nof the ptisan; and, as regards drinks, whichsoever of those about to\r\nbe described may be administered, the same directions are generally\r\napplicable. And here I know that physicians are in the practice of\r\ndoing the very reverse of what is proper, for they all wish, at the\r\ncommencement of diseases, to starve their patients for two, three, or\r\nmore days, and then to administer the ptisans and drinks; and perhaps\r\nit appears to them reasonable that, as a great change has taken place\r\nin the body, it should be counteracted by another great change. Now,\r\nindeed, to produce a change is no small matter, but the change must be\r\neffected well and cautiously, and after the change the administration\r\nof food must be conducted still more so. Those persons, then, would be\r\nmost injured if the change is not properly managed, who used unstrained\r\nptisans; they also would suffer who made use of the juice alone; and so\r\nalso they would suffer who took merely drink, but these least of all.\r\n\r\n9. One may derive information from the regimen of persons in good\r\nhealth what things are proper; for if it appear that there is a great\r\ndifference whether the diet be so and so, in other respects, but more\r\nespecially in the changes, how can it be otherwise in diseases, and\r\nmore especially in the most acute? But it is well ascertained that even\r\na faulty diet of food and drink steadily persevered in, is safer in\r\nthe main as regards health than if one suddenly change it to another.\r\nWherefore, in the case of persons who take two meals in the day, or\r\nof those who take a single meal, sudden changes induce suffering and\r\nweakness; and thus persons who have not been accustomed to dine, if\r\nthey shall take dinner, immediately become weak, have heaviness over\r\ntheir whole body, and become feeble and languid, and if, in addition,\r\nthey take supper, they will have acid eructations, and some will\r\nhave diarrhœa whose bowels were previously dry, and not having been\r\naccustomed to be twice swelled out with food and to digest it twice\r\na day, have been loaded beyond their wont. It is beneficial, in such\r\ncases, to counterbalance this change, for one should sleep after\r\ndinner, as if passing the night, and guard against cold in winter\r\nand heat in summer; or, if the person cannot sleep, he may stroll\r\nabout slowly, but without making stops, for a good while, take no\r\nsupper, or, at all events, eat little, and only things that are not\r\nunwholesome, and still more avoid drink, and especially water. Such a\r\nperson will suffer still more if he take three full meals in the day,\r\nand more still if he take more meals; and yet there are many persons\r\nwho readily bear to take three full meals in the day, provided they\r\nare so accustomed. And, moreover, those who have been in the habit of\r\neating twice a day, if they omit dinner, become feeble and powerless,\r\naverse to all work, and have heartburn; their bowels seem, as it\r\nwere, to hang loose, their urine is hot and green, and the excrement\r\nis parched; in some the mouth is bitter, the eyes are hollow, the\r\ntemples throb, and the extremities are cold, and the most of those\r\nwho have thus missed their dinner cannot eat supper; or, if they do\r\nsup, they load their stomach, and pass a much worse night than if\r\nthey had previously taken dinner. Since, then, an unwonted change of\r\ndiet for half a day produces such effects upon persons in health, it\r\nappears not to be a good thing either to add or take from. If, then,\r\nhe who was restricted to a single meal, contrary to usage, having his\r\nveins thus left empty during a whole day, when he supped according to\r\ncustom felt heavy, it is probable that if, because he was uneasy and\r\nweak from the want of dinner, he took a larger supper than wont, he\r\nwould be still more oppressed; or if, wanting food for a still greater\r\ninterval, he suddenly took a meal after supper, he will feel still\r\ngreater oppression. He, then, who, contrary to usage, has had his veins\r\nkept empty by want of food, will find it beneficial to counteract the\r\nbad effects during that day as follows: let him avoid cold, heat, and\r\nexertion, for he could bear all these ill; let him make his supper\r\nconsiderably less than usual, and not of dry food, but rather liquid;\r\nand let him take some drink, not of a watery character, nor in smaller\r\nquantity than is proportionate to the food, and on the next day he\r\nshould take a small dinner, so that, by degrees, he may return to his\r\nformer practice. Persons who are bilious in the stomach bear these\r\nchanges worst, while those who are pituitous, upon the whole, bear the\r\nwant of food best, so that they suffer the least from being restricted\r\nto one meal in the day, contrary to usage. This, then, is a sufficient\r\nproof that the greatest changes as to those things which regard\r\nour constitutions and habits are most especially concerned in the\r\nproduction of diseases, for it is impossible to produce unseasonably\r\na great emptying of the vessels by abstinence, or to administer food\r\nwhile diseases are at their acme, or when inflammation prevails; nor,\r\non the whole, to make a great change either one way or another with\r\nimpunity.[552]\r\n\r\n10. One might mention many things akin to these respecting the stomach\r\nand bowels, to show how people readily bear such food as they are\r\naccustomed to, even if it is not naturally good, and drink in like\r\nmanner, and how they bear unpleasantly such food as they are not\r\naccustomed to, even although not bad, and so in like manner with drink;\r\nand as to the effects of eating much flesh, contrary to usage, or\r\ngarlic, or asafœtida, or the stem of the plant which produces it, or\r\nthings of a similar kind possessed of strong properties, one would be\r\nless surprised if such things produce pains in the bowels, but rather\r\nwhen one learned what trouble, swelling, flatulence, and tormina\r\nthe cake (maza) will raise in the belly when eaten by a person not\r\naccustomed to it; and how much weight and distention of the bowels\r\nbread will create to a person accustomed to live upon the maza; and\r\nwhat thirst and sudden fullness will be occasioned by eating hot bread,\r\nowing to its desiccant and indigestible properties; and what different\r\neffects are produced by fine and coarse bread when eaten contrary to\r\nusage, or by the cake when unusually dry, moist, or viscid; and what\r\ndifferent effects polenta produces upon those who are accustomed and\r\nthose who are unaccustomed to the use of it; or drinking of wine or\r\ndrinking of water, when either custom is suddenly exchanged for the\r\nother; or when, contrary to usage, diluted wine or undiluted has been\r\nsuddenly drunk, for the one will create water-brash in the upper part\r\nof the intestinal canal and flatulence in the lower, while the other\r\nwill give rise to throbbing of the arteries, heaviness of the head, and\r\nthirst; and white and dark-colored wine, although both strong wines,\r\nif exchanged contrary to usage, will produce very different effects\r\nupon the body, so that one need the less wonder that a sweet and strong\r\nwine, if suddenly exchanged, should have by no means the same effect.\r\n\r\n11. Let us here briefly advert to what may be said on the opposite\r\nside; namely, that a change of diet has occurred in these cases,\r\nwithout any change in their body, either as to strength, so as to\r\nrequire an increase of food, or as to weakness, so as to require\r\na diminution. But the strength of the patient is to be taken into\r\nconsideration, and the manner of the disease, and of the constitution\r\nof the man, and the habitual regimen of the patient, not only as\r\nregards food but also drink. Yet one must much less resort to\r\naugmentation, since it is often beneficial to have recourse to\r\nabstraction, when the patient can bear it, until the disease having\r\nreached its acme and has become concocted. But in what cases this must\r\nbe done will be afterwards described. One might write many other things\r\nakin to those which have been now said, but there is a better proof,\r\nfor it is not akin to the matter on which my discourse has principally\r\nturned, but the subject-matter itself is a most seasonable proof. For\r\nsome at the commencement of acute diseases have taken food on the same\r\nday, some on the next day; some have swallowed whatever has come in\r\ntheir way, and some have taken _cyceon_.[553] Now all these things\r\nare worse than if one had observed a different regimen; and yet these\r\nmistakes, committed at that time, do much less injury than if one were\r\nto abstain entirely from food for the first two or three days, and on\r\nthe fourth or fifth day were to take such food; and it would be still\r\nworse, if one were to observe total abstinence for all these days, and\r\non the following days were to take such a diet, before the disease\r\nis concocted;[554] for in this way death would be the consequence to\r\nmost people, unless the disease were of a very mild nature. But the\r\nmistakes committed at first were not so irremediable as these, but\r\ncould be much more easily repaired. This, therefore, I think a strong\r\nproof that such or such a draught need not be prescribed on the first\r\ndays to those who will use the same draughts afterwards. At the bottom,\r\ntherefore, they do not know, neither those using unstrained ptisans,\r\nthat they are hurt by them, when they begin to swallow them, if they\r\nabstain entirely from food for two, three, or more days; nor do those\r\nusing the juice know that they are injured in swallowing them, when\r\nthey do not commence with the draught seasonably. But this they guard\r\nagainst, and know that it does much mischief, if, before the disease\r\nbe concocted, the patient swallow unstrained ptisan, when accustomed\r\nto use strained. All these things are strong proofs that physicians\r\ndo not conduct the regimen of patients properly, but that in those\r\ndiseases in which total abstinence from food should not be enforced\r\non patients that will be put on the use of ptisans, they do enforce\r\ntotal abstinence; that in those cases in which there should be no\r\nchange made from total abstinence to ptisans, they do make the change;\r\nand that, for the most part, they change from abstinence to ptisans,\r\nexactly at the time when it is often beneficial to proceed from ptisans\r\nalmost to total abstinence, if the disease happen to be in the state of\r\nexacerbation.[555] And sometimes crude matters are attracted from the\r\nhead, and bilious from the region near the chest, and the patients are\r\nattacked with insomnolency, so that the disease is not concocted; they\r\nbecome sorrowful, peevish, and delirious; there are flashes of light in\r\ntheir eyes, and noises in their ears; their extremities are cold, their\r\nurine unconcocted; the sputa thin, saltish, tinged with an intense\r\ncolour and smell; sweats about the neck, and anxiety; respiration,\r\ninterrupted in the expulsion of the air,[556] frequent and very large;\r\nexpression of the eyelids dreadful; dangerous _deliquia_; tossing\r\nof the bedclothes from the breast; the hands trembling, and sometimes\r\nthe lower lip agitated. These symptoms, appearing at the commencement,\r\nare indicative of strong delirium, and patients so affected generally\r\ndie, or if they escape, it is with a deposit, hemorrhage from the nose,\r\nor the expectoration of thick matter, and not otherwise. Neither do I\r\nperceive that physicians are skilled in such things as these; how they\r\nought to know such diseases as are connected with debility, and which\r\nare further weakened by abstinence from food, and those aggravated by\r\nsome other irritation; those by pain, and from the acute nature of the\r\ndisease, and what affections and various forms thereof our constitution\r\nand habit engender, although the knowledge or ignorance of such things\r\nbrings safety or death to the patient. For it is a great mischief if to\r\na patient debilitated by pain, and the acute nature of the disease, one\r\nadminister drink, or more ptisan, or food, supposing that the debility\r\nproceeds from inanition. It is also disgraceful not to recognize a\r\npatient whose debility is connected with inanition, and to pinch him in\r\nhis diet; this mistake, indeed, is attended with some danger, but much\r\nless than the other, and yet it is likely to expose one to much greater\r\nderision, for if another physician, or a private person, coming in and\r\nknowing what has happened, should give to eat or drink those things\r\nwhich the other had forbidden, the benefit thus done to the patient\r\nwould be manifest. Such mistakes of practitioners are particularly\r\nridiculed by mankind, for the physician or non-professional man thus\r\ncoming in, seems as it were to resuscitate the dead. On this subject\r\nI will describe elsewhere the symptoms by which each of them may be\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n12. And the following observations are similar to those now made\r\nrespecting the bowels. If the whole body rest long, contrary to\r\nusage, it does not immediately recover its strength; but if, after a\r\nprotracted repose, it proceed to labor, it will clearly expose its\r\nweakness. So it is with every one part of the body, for the feet\r\nwill make a similar display, and any other of the joints, if, being\r\nunaccustomed to labor, they be suddenly brought into action, after a\r\ntime. The teeth and the eyes will suffer in like manner, and also every\r\nother part whatever. A couch, also, that is either softer or harder\r\nthan one has been accustomed to will create uneasiness, and sleeping in\r\nthe open air, contrary to usage, hardens the body. But it is sufficient\r\nmerely to state examples of all these cases. If a person having\r\nreceived a wound in the leg, neither very serious nor very trifling,\r\nand he being neither in a condition very favorable to its healing nor\r\nthe contrary, at first betakes himself to bed, in order to promote the\r\ncure, and never raises his leg, it will thus be much less disposed to\r\ninflammation, and be much sooner well, than it would have been if he\r\nhad strolled about during the process of healing; but if upon the fifth\r\nor sixth day, or even earlier, he should get up and attempt to walk,\r\nhe will suffer much more then than if he had walked about from the\r\ncommencement of the cure, and if he should suddenly make many laborious\r\nexertions, he will suffer much more than if, when the treatment was\r\nconducted otherwise, he had made the same exertions on the same days.\r\nIn fine, all these things concur in proving that all great changes,\r\neither one way or another, are hurtful. Wherefore much mischief takes\r\nplace in the bowels, if from a state of great inanition more food than\r\nis moderate be administered (and also in the rest of the body, if\r\nfrom a state of great rest it be hastily brought to greater exertion,\r\nit will be much more injured), or if from the use of much food it be\r\nchanged to complete abstinence, and therefore the body in such cases\r\nrequires protracted repose, and if, from a state of laborious exertion,\r\nthe body suddenly falls into a state of ease and indolence, in these\r\ncases also the bowels would require continued repose from abundance of\r\nfood, for otherwise it will induce pain and heaviness in the whole body.\r\n\r\n13. The greater part of my discourse has related to changes, this way\r\nor that. For all purposes it is profitable to know these things, and\r\nmore especially respecting the subject under consideration,--that in\r\nacute diseases, in which a change is made to ptisans from a state of\r\ninanition, it should be made as I direct; and then that ptisans should\r\nnot be used until the disease be concocted, or some other symptom,\r\nwhether of evacuation or of irritation, appear in the intestines, or\r\nin the hypochondria, such as will be described. Obstinate isomnolency\r\nimpairs the digestion of the food and drink, and in other respects\r\nchanges and relaxes the body, and occasions a heated state, and\r\nheaviness of the head.[557]\r\n\r\n14. One must determine by such marks as these, when sweet, strong,\r\nand dark wine, hydromel, water and oxymel, should be given in acute\r\ndiseases.[558] Wherefore the sweet affects the head less than the\r\nstrong, attacks the brain less, evacuates the bowels more than the\r\nother, but induces swelling of the spleen and liver; it does not\r\nagree with bilious persons, for it causes them to thirst; it creates\r\nflatulence in the upper part of the intestinal canal, but does not\r\ndisagree with the lower part, as far as regards flatulence; and yet\r\nflatulence engendered by sweet wine is not of a transient nature, but\r\nrests for a long time in the hypochondria. And therefore it in general\r\nis less diuretic than wine which is strong and thin; but sweet wine is\r\nmore expectorant than the other. But when it creates thirst, it is less\r\nexpectorant in such cases than the other wine, but if it do not create\r\nthirst, it promotes expectoration better than the other. The good and\r\nbad effects of a white, strong wine, have been already frequently and\r\nfully stated in the disquisition on sweet wine; it is determined to\r\nthe bladder more than the other, is diuretic and laxative, and should\r\nbe very useful in such complaints; for if in other respects it be less\r\nsuitable than the other, the clearing out of the bladder effected by\r\nit is beneficial to the patient, if properly administered. There are\r\nexcellent examples of the beneficial and injurious effects of wine,\r\nall which were left undetermined by my predecessors. In these diseases\r\nyou may use a yellow wine, and a dark austere wine for the following\r\npurposes: if there be no heaviness of the head, nor delirium, nor\r\nstoppage of the expectoration, nor retention of the urine, and if the\r\nalvine discharges be more loose and like scrapings than usual, in such\r\ncases a change from a white wine to such as I have mentioned, might be\r\nvery proper. It deserves further to be known, that it will prove less\r\ninjurious to all the parts above, and to the bladder, if it be of a\r\nmore watery nature, but that the stronger it is, it will be the more\r\nbeneficial to the bowels.\r\n\r\n15. Hydromel, when drunk in any stage of acute disease, is less\r\nsuitable to persons of a bilious temperament, and to those who have\r\nenlarged viscera, than to those of a different character; it increases\r\nthirst less than sweet wine; it softens the lungs, is moderately\r\nexpectorant, and alleviates a cough; for it has some detergent\r\nquality in it, whence it lubricates the sputum.[559] Hydromel is also\r\nmoderately diuretic, unless prevented by the state of any of the\r\nviscera. And it also occasions bilious discharges downwards, sometimes\r\nof a proper character, and sometimes more intense and frothy than\r\nis suitable; but such rather occurs in persons who are bilious, and\r\nhave enlarged viscera. Hydromel rather produces expectoration, and\r\nsoftening of the lungs, when given diluted with water.[560] But unmixed\r\nhydromel, rather than the diluted, produces frothy evacuations, such\r\nas are unseasonably and intensely bilious, and too hot; but such an\r\nevacuation occasions other great mischiefs, for it neither extinguishes\r\nthe heat in the hypochondria, but rouses it, induces inquietude, and\r\njactitation of the limbs, and ulcerates the intestines and anus. The\r\nremedies for all these will be described afterwards. By using hydromel\r\nwithout ptisans, instead of any other drink, you will generally succeed\r\nin the treatment of such diseases, and fail in few cases; but in\r\nwhat instances it is to be given, and in what it is not to be given,\r\nand wherefore it is not to be given,--all this has been explained\r\nalready, for the most part. Hydromel is generally condemned, as if\r\nit weakened the powers of those who drink it, and on that account it\r\nis supposed to accelerate death; and this opinion arose from persons\r\nwho starve themselves to death, some of whom use hydromel alone for\r\ndrink, as fancying that it really has this effect. But this is by no\r\nmeans always the case. For hydromel, if drunk alone, is much stronger\r\nthan water, if it do not disorder the bowels; but in some respects it\r\nis stronger, and in some weaker, than wine that is thin, weak, and\r\ndevoid of _bouquet_. There is a great difference between unmixed\r\nwine and unmixed honey, as to their nutritive powers, for if a man\r\nwill drink double the quantity of pure wine, to a certain quantity\r\nof honey which is swallowed, he will find himself much stronger from\r\nthe honey, provided it do not disagree with his bowels, and that his\r\nalvine evacuations from it will be much more copious. But if he shall\r\nuse ptisan for a draught, and drink afterward hydromel, he will feel\r\nfull, flatulent, and uncomfortable in the viscera of the hypochondrium;\r\nbut if the hydromel be taken before the draught, it will not have\r\nthe same injurious effects as if taken after it, but will be rather\r\nbeneficial. And boiled hydromel has a much more elegant appearance\r\nthan the unboiled, being clear, thin, white, and transparent, but I am\r\nunable to mention any good quality which it possesses that the other\r\nwants. For it is not sweeter than the unboiled, provided the honey be\r\nfine, and it is weaker, and occasions less copious evacuations of the\r\nbowels, neither of which effects is required from the hydromel. But one\r\nshould by all means use it boiled, provided the honey be bad, impure,\r\nblack, and not fragrant, for the boiling will remove the most of its\r\nbad qualities and appearances.\r\n\r\n16. You will find the drink, called oxymel, often very useful in these\r\ncomplaints, for it promotes expectoration and freedom of breathing.\r\nThe following are the proper occasions for administering it. When\r\nstrongly acid it has no mean operation in rendering the expectoration\r\nmore easy, for by bringing up the sputa, which occasion troublesome\r\nhawking, and rendering them more slippery, and, as it were, clearing\r\nthe windpipe with a feather, it relieves the lungs and proves emollient\r\nto them; and when it succeeds in producing these effects it must do\r\nmuch good. But there are cases in which hydromel, strongly acid,\r\ndoes not promote expectoration, but renders it more viscid and thus\r\ndoes harm, and it is most apt to produce these bad effects in cases\r\nwhich are otherwise of a fatal character, when the patient is unable\r\nto cough or bring up the sputa. On this account, then, one ought to\r\nconsider beforehand the strength of the patient, and if there be any\r\nhope, then one may give it, but if given at all in such cases it\r\nshould be quite tepid, and in by no means large doses. But if slightly\r\nacrid it moistens the mouth and throat, promotes expectoration, and\r\nquenches thirst; agrees with the viscera seated in the hypochondrium,\r\nand obviates the bad effects of the honey; for the bilious quality of\r\nthe honey is thereby corrected. It also promotes flatulent discharges\r\nfrom the bowels, and is diuretic, but it occasions watery discharges\r\nand those resembling scrapings, from the lower part of the intestine,\r\nwhich is sometimes a bad thing in acute diseases, more especially when\r\nthe flatulence cannot be passed, but rolls backwards; and otherwise it\r\ndiminishes the strength and makes the extremities cold, this is the\r\nonly bad effect worth mentioning which I have known to arise from the\r\noxymel. It may suit well to drink a little of this at night before the\r\ndraught of ptisan, and when a considerable interval of time has passed\r\nafter the draught there will be nothing to prevent its being taken.\r\nBut to those who are restricted entirely to drinks without draughts\r\nof ptisan, it will therefore not be proper at all times to give it,\r\nmore especially from the fretting and irritation of the intestine\r\nwhich it occasions, (and these bad effects it will be the more apt to\r\nproduce provided there be no fæces in the intestines and the patient\r\nis laboring under inanition,) and then it will weaken the powers of\r\nthe hydromel. But if it appears advantageous to use a great deal of\r\nthis drink during the whole course of the disease, one should add to\r\nit merely as much vinegar as can just be perceived by the taste, for\r\nthus what is prejudicial in it will do the least possible harm, and\r\nwhat is beneficial will do the more good. In a word, the acidity of\r\nvinegar agrees rather with those who are troubled with bitter bile,\r\nthan with those patients whose bile is black; for the bitter principle\r\nis dissolved in it and turned to phlegm, by being suspended in it;\r\nwhereas black bile is fermented, swells up, and is multiplied thereby:\r\nfor vinegar is a melanogogue. Vinegar is more prejudicial to women than\r\nto men, for it creates pains in the uterus.\r\n\r\n17. I have nothing further to add as to the effects of water when\r\nused as a drink in acute diseases; for it neither soothes the cough in\r\npneumonia, nor promotes expectoration, but does less than the others\r\nin this respect, if used alone through the whole complaint. But if\r\ntaken intermediate between oxymel and hydromel, in small quantity,\r\nit promotes expectoration from the change which it occasions in the\r\nqualities of these drinks, for it produces, as it were, a certain\r\noverflow. Otherwise it does not quench the thirst, for it creates bile\r\nin a bilious temperament, and is injurious to the hypochondrium; and\r\nit does the most harm, engenders most bile, and does the least good\r\nwhen the bowels are empty; and it increases the swelling of the spleen\r\nand liver when they are in an inflamed state; it produces a gurgling\r\nnoise in the intestines and swims on the stomach; for it passes slowly\r\ndownwards, as being of a coldish and indigestible nature, and neither\r\nproves laxative nor diuretic; and in this respect, too, it proves\r\nprejudicial, that it does not naturally form fæces in the intestines:\r\nand, if it be drunk while the feet are cold, its injurious effects\r\nwill be greatly aggravated, in all those parts to which it may be\r\ndetermined. When you suspect in these diseases either strong heaviness\r\nof the head, or mental alienation, you must abstain entirely from wine,\r\nand in this case use water, or give weak, straw colored wine, entirely\r\ndevoid of _bouquet_, after which a little water is to be given\r\nin addition; for thus the strength of the wine will less affect the\r\nhead and the understanding: but in which cases water is mostly to be\r\ngiven for drink, when in large quantity, when in moderate, when cold,\r\nand when hot; all these things have either been discussed already or\r\nwill be treated of at the proper time. In like manner, with respect\r\nto all the others, such as barley-water, the drinks made from green\r\nshoots, those from raisins, and the skins of grapes and wheat, and\r\nbastard saffron, and myrtles, pomegranates, and the others, when the\r\nproper time for using them is come, they will be treated of along\r\nwith the disease in question, in like manner as the other compound\r\nmedicines.[561]\r\n\r\n18. The bath is useful in many diseases, in some of them when used\r\nsteadily, and in others when not so. Sometimes it must be less used\r\nthan it would be otherwise, from the want of accommodation; for in few\r\nfamilies are all the conveniences prepared, and persons who can manage\r\nthem as they ought to be. And if the patient be not bathed properly, he\r\nmay be thereby hurt in no inconsiderable degree, for there is required\r\na place to cover him that is free of smoke, abundance of water,\r\nmaterials for frequent baths, but not very large, unless this should be\r\nrequired. It is better that no friction should be applied, but if so, a\r\nhot soap (_smegma_)[562] must be used in greater abundance than is\r\ncommon, and an affusion of a considerable quantity of water is to made\r\nat the same time and afterwards repeated. There must also be a short\r\npassage to the basin, and it should be of easy ingress and egress. But\r\nthe person who takes the bath should be orderly and reserved in his\r\nmanner, should do nothing for himself, but others should pour the water\r\nupon him and rub him, and plenty of waters, of various temperatures,\r\nshould be in readiness for the _douche_, and the affusions\r\nquickly made;[563] and sponges should be used instead of the comb\r\n(_strigil_), and the body should be anointed when not quite dry.\r\nBut the head should be rubbed by the sponge until it is quite dry; the\r\nextremities should be protected from cold, as also the head and the\r\nrest of the body; and a man should not be washed immediately after he\r\nhas taken a draught of ptisan or a drink; neither should he take ptisan\r\nas a drink immediately after the bath. Much will depend upon whether\r\nthe patient, when in good health, was very fond of the bath, and in the\r\ncustom of taking it: for such persons, especially, feel the want of it,\r\nand are benefited if they are bathed, and injured if they are not. In\r\ngeneral it suits better with cases of pneumonia than in ardent fevers;\r\nfor the bath soothes the pain in the side, chest, and back; concocts\r\nthe sputa, promotes expectoration, improves the respiration, and allays\r\nlassitude; for it soothes the joints and outer skin, and is diuretic,\r\nremoves heaviness of the head, and moistens the nose. Such are the\r\nbenefits to be derived from the bath, if all the proper requisites be\r\npresent; but if one or more of these be wanting, the bath, instead of\r\ndoing good, may rather prove injurious; for every one of them may do\r\nharm if not prepared by the attendants in the proper manner. It is by\r\nno means a suitable thing in these diseases to persons whose bowels are\r\ntoo loose, or when they are unusually confined, and there has been no\r\nprevious evacuation; neither must we bathe those who are debilitated,\r\nnor such as have nausea or vomiting, or bilious eructations; nor such\r\nas have hemorrhage from the nose, unless it be less than required at\r\nthat stage of the disease, (with those stages you are acquainted:)\r\nbut if the discharge be less than proper, one should use the bath,\r\nwhether in order to benefit the whole body or the head alone. If then\r\nthe proper requisites be at hand, and the patient be well disposed to\r\nthe bath, it may be administered once every day, or if the patient be\r\nfond of the bath there will be no harm, though he should take it twice\r\nin the day. The use of the bath is much more appropriate to those who\r\ntake unstrained ptisan, than to those who take only the juice of it,\r\nalthough even in their case it may be proper; but least of all does\r\nit suit with those who use only plain drink, although, in their case\r\ntoo it may be suitable; but one must form a judgment from the rules\r\nlaid down before, in which of these modes of regimen the bath will be\r\nbeneficial, and in which not. Such as want some of the requisites for\r\na proper bath, but have those symptoms which would be benefited by it,\r\nshould be bathed; whereas those who want none of the proper requisites,\r\nbut have certain symptoms which contra-indicate the bath, are not to be\r\nbathed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         APPENDIX TO THE WORK\r\n\r\n                                  ON\r\n\r\n                      REGIMEN IN ACUTE DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nNo one can read this piece attentively without coming to the conclusion\r\nthat it is not a natural continuation of the subject discussed in the\r\npreceding work, but that it is made up, in a considerable measure, of\r\nmaterials extracted from it. Expositions of subjects which are there\r\ngiven methodically are here presented in a disjointed form; and rules\r\nof practice there laid down with precision are here often delivered in\r\na vague and indefinite shape. Still, however, it must be admitted, that\r\nthe reverse is sometimes the case, and that what is presented imperfect\r\nin the former part of the work is here sometimes reproduced very\r\nmuch improved. It has been therefore a matter of much dispute among\r\nthe critics whether this portion be the composition of Hippocrates,\r\nor whether it be altogether the work of a different hand. The most\r\nprobable conjecture respecting it seems to be, that as Hippocrates in\r\nthe preceding part several times announces his intention of giving\r\na continuation of the subject, some one of his immediate disciples\r\nundertook the work which he had thus promised, and composed this\r\ntreatise from fragments left by the author himself, and from materials\r\ncollected from his other works. As stated by Galen in his Commentary,\r\nand as we have explained in our remarks on the “Aphorisms,” in the\r\nsecond section of the Preliminary Discourse, it was a common practice,\r\nin ancient times, to add appendices to popular works. I can have no\r\nhesitation, then, in following the example of M. Littré, who recognizes\r\nit as an appendix to the preceding work. But I must say that I rather\r\nincline, with Galen, to think that there are many things in it which\r\ncannot have come from Hippocrates, than to hold with M. Littré that it\r\nis nearly or altogether his composition. But however that may be, it\r\nindisputably contains much interesting matter, for which we have every\r\nreason to believe that we are indebted to Hippocrates, either directly\r\nor at second hand. I shall now give a brief abstract of its contents.\r\n\r\nHe commences with some general observations on the nature and\r\ntreatment of causus, the endemial fever of Greece. What is said on this\r\nhead is much to the purpose, but incomplete. Then there is given a\r\ngeneral rule for bleeding in diseases which certainly is well deserving\r\nof attention at the present day, when professional opinions on this\r\npoint of medical practice are very much unsettled. Nowadays we have\r\nabandoned all general rules of practice, and profess to be guided\r\nsolely by experience; but how variable and uncertain are its results\r\nin the present case! I myself--albeit but verging towards the decline\r\nof life--can well remember the time when a physician would have run\r\nthe risk of being indicted for culpable homicide if he had ventured\r\nto bleed a patient in common fever; about twenty-five years ago\r\nvenesection in fever, and in almost every disease, was the established\r\norder of the day; and now what shall I state as the general practice\r\nthat has been sanctioned by the experience of the present generation?\r\nI can scarcely say, so variable has the practice in fever and in many\r\nother diseases become of late years. One thing is remarkable in the\r\npresent work with regard to venesection in pneumonia and pleurisy,\r\nnamely, that it is directed to be carried the length of inducing\r\n_deliquium animi_, contrary to the practice laid down in the\r\npreceding work, and to the rule which was followed by all the other\r\nancient authorities. Another of the rules regarding bleeding here\r\ndelivered is also deserving of attention, namely, that in inflammatory\r\ndiseases it is improper to purge before bleeding, but that venesection\r\nshould precede all other means of cure.\r\n\r\nThe section in which cynanche is treated of appears to me to be highly\r\ninteresting and important. I think it may be a question whether the\r\nprognostic spirit of Hippocrates and his followers had not in a great\r\nmeasure anticipated all the results of modern diagnosis.\r\n\r\nAfter this there follows some additional account of causus, which,\r\nalthough out of place, contains observations of considerable interest.\r\n\r\nTo the treatment of pleurisy and pneumonia we have already alluded, but\r\nthe subject is so interesting that we cannot dismiss it with so brief a\r\nnotice. In the ancient method of treating fevers and febrile affections\r\nthree main objects would appear to have been kept in view: 1st, by\r\ndepletions, to remove the morbid fluids from the general system, or to\r\ndraw them off from a particular spot in which they had fixed; 2d, by\r\ndiluents, to supply the waste of fluids occasioned by the preternatural\r\nheat of the body; and, 3d, to support the strength by a suitable supply\r\nof such nutriment as the system is then capable of receiving.\r\n\r\nNow with regard to venesection, it will be seen in this and the\r\npreceding work that the practice is regulated by certain well-marked\r\nindications, namely, the seat of the pain, the condition of the\r\npatient, and the characters of the sputa. The purging is regulated by\r\nthe state of matters below the chest, it being held as a general rule\r\nthat clysters should be administered regularly every day during the\r\nfirst days of the fever. After purging comes the cooling drinks, such\r\nas oxymel. The administration of farinaceous food in a liquid state,\r\nthat is to say, of unstrained ptisan, is to be regulated by the state\r\nof the sputa and urinary sediment, namely, when the sputa have put on a\r\npurulent appearance, and the sediment has become copious and reddish.\r\nNow this certainly seems to be a very intelligible and judicious rule\r\nfor the administration of nutritious articles in febrile diseases. I\r\nneed scarcely remark that at the present time there is scarcely a rule\r\nof practice in medicine which is worse defined than this respecting\r\nthe administration of wine and other alimentary substances in febrile\r\ndiseases. In proof of what is now stated, I would beg leave to refer\r\nthe reader to what will be admitted to be one of the best authorities\r\nin modern literature on fever, I mean to Dr. Tweedie’s elaborate\r\narticle on this subject, in the “Cyclopædia of Medicine.” It will be\r\nseen, at vol. ii., p. 208, that the rules for the administration of\r\nwine and other articles of food are by no means well defined. A cool\r\nskin and a soft pulse, when combined with debility, are the indications\r\nupon which most stress is laid; but the pulse, as long ago it was\r\npronounced by Celsus to be, is “res fallacissima,” and of this the\r\nexcellent author seems to have been sensible; for the injunctions\r\nwhich he gives to regulate the administration of the wine and other\r\narticles, by the effects they produce, sufficiently show that he was\r\nsensible how deficient in precision our knowledge of the subject is at\r\npresent. At the same time he makes it appear that he was well aware\r\nof one important fact in the treatment of febrile diseases, which,\r\nalthough distinctly recognized by Hippocrates, is still frequently\r\noverlooked by ordinary practitioners, namely, that in convalescence\r\nthe stomach partakes of the general debility, and is unable to digest\r\nfood in any great quantity at that time.[564] M. Littré further calls\r\nattention to another rule for the administration of wine, lately laid\r\ndown by Dr. Stokes, of Dublin, which is certainly a most important\r\none, provided it is confirmed by time and experience. It is founded on\r\nauscultation, and is to this effect; that when the impulse of the heart\r\nis abnormally weak, and when there is a diminution of the proportion\r\nbetween the two _bruits_, or when there is a preponderance in the\r\nsound of the second _bruit_, wine may be freely administered.\r\nNow, as I have said, this rule, if sanctioned by ample experience,\r\nis undoubtedly a most excellent one; but I may be allowed to remark,\r\nthat my own observations on the heart in fever have led me to the\r\nconclusion that, as I have stated respecting the pulse, its sounds are\r\nvery fallacious; and I must say that the rule of Hippocrates appears\r\nmore likely to prove a certain guide in this instance. For is it not\r\na natural view of the subject, that wine and other articles of food\r\nshould be withheld while the emunctories are not in a condition to\r\ncast off the recrementitous superfluities of the system; but that when\r\nthe secretions are properly established, alimentary substances may be\r\nsafely administered?[565]\r\n\r\nThere is another point connected with the regimen in acute diseases\r\non which I have a remark or two to make--it is the administration of\r\nanimal matters in a fluid state, such as beef-tea, or soups from fowls.\r\nThese we see frequently administered in febrile cases by practitioners\r\nof the present day, but by the ancient authorities they would appear\r\nto have been entirely rejected. Which party is the safer guide in this\r\ncase? For my own part, I have long thought that animal matters, when\r\nintroduced into the system while in a febrile state, have a tendency\r\nto become putrid, and thereby to occasion an increase of the heat and\r\ngeneral disorder.\r\n\r\nAfter some defective observations on dysentery, our author treats of\r\ntetanus; but here Galen objects to the characters which he gives of the\r\nurine, and to his practice as regards the administration of wine. His\r\nviews, however, are not very different from those which now prevail.\r\n\r\nHaving made some general remarks on the administration of hellebore,\r\nto which he was very partial, he proceeds to point out the bad effects\r\nresulting from any change in regimen. His views here are very similar\r\nto the observations contained in the preceding portion of the work, and\r\nin the treatise “On Ancient Medicine.”\r\n\r\nThe account of dry cholera is confused and vague. By it he would seem\r\nto mean flatulent colic, or _dry belly-ache_. See Opera, ed.\r\nLittré, tom. ii., p. 388.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph on dropsy is interesting, although the views taken of\r\nthe subject are incomplete. Tympanitis is recognized as a variety of\r\ndropsy. Then follow some detached observations on persons whose bowels\r\nare heated, and on the regulation of the diet, with some remarks on\r\nthe different states which counter-indicate purging. At § 23 there are\r\nsome practical observations on various conditions of the constitution,\r\nwhich it would no doubt be proper for the physician to make himself\r\nacquainted with. The contents of all the remaining paragraphs would\r\nseem to have nothing to do with the subject of this treatise.\r\n\r\nFrom what is now stated the reader will readily perceive that this\r\ntreatise abounds in interesting matters, which, even at the present\r\nday, may prove suggestive of important views in the theory and practice\r\nof medicine. And although the style, in the judgment of Galen, be very\r\ndifferent from Hippocrates, and the mode of thought deficient in that\r\nprecision for which he is so remarkable, the treatise is unquestionably\r\na work of great ability, and contains what we have reason to regard\r\nas the results of his experience and meditations on many important\r\nsubjects. I should have thought it quite unwarrantable, therefore, to\r\nhave rejected this piece from a volume which professes to give all\r\nthe genuine remains of our great author. And moreover, at the risk,\r\nperhaps, of being set down as an antique devotée, I do not hesitate\r\nto declare that in my opinion this and the preceding portion, taken\r\ntogether, contain more original information on the important subject\r\nto which they relate than is to be found in any medical work which has\r\nbeen written from the days of our author down to the present time.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the present Argument by giving from Cælius Aurelianus\r\nthe criticisms of Soranus on the opinions of our author, as delivered\r\nin these two treatises. It is to be borne in mind that Soranus was\r\nthe chief of the ancient sect of physicians called _Methodici_,\r\nwhich was very inimically disposed towards all the others, and more\r\nespecially to Hippocrates. Though most of the strictures are evidently\r\noverstrained, it cannot fail to be interesting to the reader to have an\r\nopportunity of considering them, such as they are.\r\n\r\nAfter giving an elaborate analysis of our author’s views, Cælius\r\nAurelianus proceeds as follows: “His Soranus respondens ait. In\r\ncalefactionibus acres esse sales, ac necessario tumorem provocare,\r\nfebremque accendere, poscam etiam constringere et stricturam passionis\r\naugere. Item milium frixum graveolens et nidorosum, atque capiti\r\ngrave, maximè acutè fabricitantium esse perspicimus. Spongiis etiam\r\nerat melius quenquam in dimissione patientes partes vaporare, atque\r\noleo calido perfundere. Est præterea improprium, ac sine ratione, tunc\r\nuti phlebotomo quoties ad superiora dolor tetenderit; prohibere autem\r\nquoties ad inferiora descenderit. Oportet ergo sub hoc argumento neque\r\ndifficultate tumorum partibus inferioribus impeditos phlebotomare:\r\nneque etiam podagricos si quidem inferiora tumere videantur, sed\r\nnecessariò quoties dolor ad superiora tetenderit, phlebotomiam\r\nadhibendam videmus. Siquidem sæpe pejorante ventris fluore, hoc\r\nadjutorii genus prohibetur. Neque etiam (ut ait) oportet interiorem\r\nvenam dividi. Siquidem et exteriori et media divisa corpora releventur.\r\nQuippe quum e contrario interiorem prohibeant, propter magnitudinem,\r\nne tumor augeatur. Item sanguinis mutatio iners est detractionis\r\nmoderationi, sicuti de adjutoriis scribentes demonstrabimus. Sese\r\ndenique idem Hippocrates impugnat in consequentibus, dicens usque\r\nad animi defectum faciendam detractionem, quod magis vehementer est\r\nnocens: siquidem est pericolosa defectio, et neque si sit temporaliter\r\ndefectionis causa, sensu carens ægrotans, dolore relevatus, videbitur\r\n(quum resumptus fuerit) rursum non dolere, quum magis atque magis\r\nejusdem passionis debilia corpora vehementius officiant. Item\r\npurgativa medicamina (quæ Græci καθαρτικὰ vocant) acrimoniæ causa,\r\nstomachum tumentem, atque hypezocota membranum acuunt in tumorem; et\r\nin periculum ventris effusionem provocantia, magnificam passionis\r\ningerunt vehementiam. Nutrire etiam cibo post medicamen non oportebat.\r\nPugnat enim purgationi faciundæ illatum cibi nutrimentum. Quippe quum\r\nmedicamine corruptum, officii sui careat viribus. Mitto etiam quod ex\r\ninitio acescere facile ptisanæ succus perspiciatur, confectus quippe ex\r\nordei succo, qui sit digestione difficilis. Dehine ægrotantis corpus\r\nnon valet tantum sustinere nutrimentum, quantum sanitatis tempore\r\nsolitum videbatur. Item mulsum ex aceto (quod oxymeli appellavit)\r\nsine discretione accipimus. Est etiam immodica usque ad septimum\r\ndiem cibi abstinentia, quam custodiendam ordinavit.[566] Quippe cum\r\nnullus vehementiam passionis sustinere valet, nisi nutrimento quamvis\r\nparvo toleratus: et neque in declinatione passionis aliquid humanius\r\ncibo largitur, sed in iisdem sorbilibus perseverandum existimat\r\nsuccis. At cum fuerint sputa segniora, tunc ut existimat, erit primo\r\næger nutriendus, quomodo necessariò declinante passione occurrunt\r\nintolerato. In cæteris relinquendum temporibus absque nutrimento\r\nægrotantem apertissimè indicavit, quum semper plurimum utilitatis\r\nadjutorium cibi, quam cætera possunt adjutoria, largiatur. Omne etiam\r\ncorpus erit unctione coæquandum, et non ejus particula. Quippe cum\r\ntotum cibo nutriatur, ipsa quoque unctio non exerta, anxietatem ingerit\r\nægrotanti, quæ latentem difficultatem, atque accessione veniente,\r\ncorporis provocat incendium.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         APPENDIX TO THE WORK\r\n\r\n                                  ON\r\n\r\n                      REGIMEN IN ACUTE DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nArdent fever (causus)[567] takes place when the veins, being dried up\r\nin the summer season, attract acrid and bilious humors to themselves;\r\nand strong fever seizes the whole body, which experiences aches of the\r\nbones, and is in a state of lassitude and pain. It takes place most\r\ncommonly from a long walk and protracted thirst, when the veins being\r\ndried up attract acrid and hot defluxions to themselves. The tongue\r\nbecomes rough, dry, and very black; there are gnawing pains about the\r\nbowels; the alvine discharges are watery and yellow; there is intense\r\nthirst, insomnolency, and sometimes wandering of the mind. To a person\r\nin such a state give to drink water and as much boiled hydromel of a\r\nwatery consistence as he will take; and if the mouth be bitter, it\r\nmay be advantageous to administer an emetic and clyster; and if these\r\nthings do not loosen the bowels, purge with the boiled milk of asses.\r\nGive nothing saltish nor acrid, for they will not be borne; and give\r\nno draughts of ptisan until the crisis be past. And the affection is\r\nresolved if there be an epistaxis, or if true critical sweats supervene\r\nwith urine having white, thick, and smooth sediments, or if a deposit\r\ntake place anywhere; but if it be resolved without these, there will be\r\na relapse of the complaint, or pain in the hips and legs will ensue,\r\nwith thick sputa, provided the patient be convalescent. Another species\r\nof ardent fever: belly loose, much thirst, tongue rough, dry, and\r\nsaltish, retention of urine, insomnolency, extremities cold. In such a\r\ncase, unless there be a flow of blood from the nose, or an abscess form\r\nabout the neck, or pain in the limbs, or the patient expectorate thick\r\nsputa (these occur when the belly is constipated), or pain of the hips,\r\nor lividity of the genital organs, there is no crisis; tension of the\r\ntesticle is also a critical symptom. Give attractive draughts.[568]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Bleed in the acute affections, if the disease appear strong, and\r\nthe patients be in the vigor of life, and if they have strength.[569]\r\nIf it be quinsy or any other of the pleuritic affections, purge with\r\nelectuaries; but if the patient be weaker, or if you abstract more\r\nblood, you may administer a clyster every third day, until he be out of\r\ndanger, and enjoin total abstinence if necessary.\r\n\r\n3. Hypochondria inflamed not from retention of flatus, tension of\r\nthe diaphragm, checked respiration, with dry orthopnœa, when no pus\r\nis formed, but when these complaints are connected with obstructed\r\nrespiration; but more especially strong pains of the liver, heaviness\r\nof the spleen, and other phlegmasiæ and intense pains above the\r\ndiaphragm, diseases connected with collections of humors,--all these\r\ndiseases do not admit of resolution, if treated at first by medicine,\r\nbut venesection holds the first place in conducting the treatment;\r\nthen we may have recourse to a clyster, unless the disease be great\r\nand strong; but if so, purging also may be necessary; but bleeding\r\nand purging together require caution and moderation. Those who\r\nattempt to resolve inflammatory diseases at the commencement by the\r\nadministration of purgative medicines, remove none of the morbific\r\nhumors which produce the inflammation and tension: for the diseases\r\nwhile unconcocted could not yield, but they melt down those parts which\r\nare healthy and resist the disease; so when the body is debilitated the\r\nmalady obtains the mastery; and when the disease has the upper hand of\r\nthe body, it does not admit of a cure.[570]\r\n\r\n4. When a person suddenly loses his speech, in connection with\r\nobstruction of the veins,--if this happen without warning or any other\r\nstrong cause, one ought to open the internal vein of the right arm,\r\nand abstract blood more or less according to the habit and age of the\r\npatient. Such cases are mostly attended with the following symptoms:\r\nredness of the face, eyes fixed, hands distended, grinding of the\r\nteeth, palpitations, jaws fixed, coldness of the extremities, retention\r\nof airs in the veins.[571]\r\n\r\n5. When pains precede, and there are influxes of black bile and\r\nof acrid humors, and when by their pungency the internal parts are\r\npained, and the veins being pinched and dried become distended, and\r\ngetting inflamed attract the humors running into the parts, whence\r\nthe blood being vitiated, and the airs collected there not being able\r\nto find their natural passages, coldness comes on in consequence of\r\nthis stasis, with vertigo, loss of speech, heaviness of the head, and\r\nconvulsion, if the disease fix on the liver, the heart, or the great\r\nvein (vena cava?); whence they are seized with epilepsy or apoplexy,\r\nif the defluxions fall upon the containing parts,[572] and if they are\r\ndried up by airs which cannot make their escape; such persons having\r\nbeen first fomented are to be immediately bled at the commencement,\r\nwhile all the peccant vapors and humors are buoyant, for then the cases\r\nmore easily admit of a cure; and then supporting the strength and\r\nattending to the crisis, we may give emetics, unless the disease be\r\nalleviated; or if the bowels be not moved, we may administer a clyster\r\nand give the boiled milk of asses, to the amount of not less than\r\ntwelve heminæ, or if the strength permit, to more than sixteen.\r\n\r\n6. Quinsy takes place when a copious and viscid defluxion from the\r\nhead, in the season of winter or spring, flows into the jugular veins,\r\nand when from their large size they attract a greater defluxion; and\r\nwhen owing to the defluxion being of a cold and viscid nature it\r\nbecomes enfarcted, obstructing the passages of the respiration and of\r\nthe blood, coagulates the surrounding blood, and renders it motionless\r\nand stationary, it being naturally cold and disposed to obstructions.\r\nHence they are seized with convulsive suffocation, the tongue turning\r\nlivid, assuming a rounded shape, and being bent owing to the veins\r\nwhich are seated below the tongue (for when an enlarged uvula, which\r\nis called _uva_, is cut, a large vein may be observed on each\r\nside). These veins, then, becoming filled, and their roots extending\r\ninto the tongue, which is of a loose and spongy texture, it, owing\r\nto its dryness receiving forcibly the juice from the veins, changes\r\nfrom broad and becomes round, its natural color turns to livid,\r\nfrom a soft consistence it grows hard, instead of being flexible it\r\nbecomes inflexible, so that the patient would soon be suffocated\r\nunless speedily relieved. Bleeding, then, in the arm, and opening the\r\nsublingual veins, and purging with the electuaries, and giving warm\r\ngargles, and shaving the head, we must apply to it and the neck a\r\ncerate, and wrap them round with wool, and foment with soft sponges\r\nsqueezed out of hot water; give to drink water and hydromel, not cold;\r\nand administer the juice of ptisan when, having passed the crisis, the\r\npatient is out of danger. When, in the season of summer or autumn,\r\nthere is a hot and nitrous defluxion from the head (it is rendered\r\nhot and acrid by the season), being of such a nature it corrodes and\r\nulcerates, and fills with air, and orthopnœa attended with great\r\ndryness supervenes; the fauces, when examined, do not seem swollen;\r\nthe tendons on the back part of the neck are contracted, and have the\r\nappearance as if it were tetanus; the voice is lost, the breathing\r\nis small, and inspiration becomes frequent and laborious. In such\r\npersons the trachea becomes ulcerated, and the lungs engorged, from the\r\npatient’s not being able to draw in the external air. In such cases,\r\nunless there be a spontaneous determination to the external parts of\r\nthe neck, the symptoms become still more dreadful, and the danger more\r\nimminent, partly owing to the season, and the hot and acrid humors\r\nwhich cause the disease.[573]\r\n\r\n7. When fever seizes a person who has lately taken food, and whose\r\nbowels are loaded with fæces which have been long retained, whether it\r\nbe attended with pain of the side or not, he ought to lie quiet until\r\nthe food descend to the lower region of the bowels, and use oxymel for\r\ndrink; but when the load descends to the loins, a clyster should be\r\nadministered, or he should be purged by medicine; and when purged, he\r\nshould take ptisan for food and hydromel for drink; then he may take\r\nthe cerealia, and boiled fishes, and a watery wine in small quantity,\r\nat night, but during the day, a watery hydromel. When the flatus is\r\noffensive, either a suppository or clyster is to be administered; but\r\notherwise the oxymel is to be discontinued, until the matters descend\r\nto the lower part of the bowels, and then they are to be evacuated\r\nby a clyster. But if the ardent fever (_causus_) supervene when\r\nthe bowels are empty, should you still judge it proper to administer\r\npurgative medicine, it ought not be done during the first three\r\ndays, nor earlier than the fourth. When you give the medicine, use\r\nthe ptisan, observing the paroxysms of the fevers, so as not to give\r\nit when the fever is setting in, but when it is ceasing, or on the\r\ndecline, and as far as possible from the commencement. When the feet\r\nare cold, give neither drink nor ptisan, nor anything else of the kind,\r\nbut reckon it an important rule to refrain until they become warm,\r\nand then you may administer them with advantage. For the most part,\r\ncoldness of the feet is a symptom of a paroxysm of the fever coming on;\r\nand if at such a season you apply those things, you will commit the\r\ngreatest possible mistake, for you will augment the disease in no small\r\ndegree. But when the fever ceases, the feet, on the contrary, become\r\nhotter than the rest of the body; for when the heat leaves the feet, it\r\nis kindled up in the breast, and sends its flame up to the head. And\r\nwhen all the heat rushes upwards, and is exhaled at the head, it is not\r\nto be wondered at that the feet become cold, being devoid of flesh, and\r\ntendinous; and besides, they contract cold, owing to their distance\r\nfrom the hotter parts of the body, an accumulation of heat having\r\ntaken place in the chest: and again, in like manner, when the fever is\r\nresolved and dissipated, the heat descends to the feet, and, at the\r\nsame time, the head and chest become cold. Wherefore one should attend\r\nto this; that when the feet are cold, the bowels are necessarily hot,\r\nand filled with nauseous matters; the hypochondrium distended: there\r\nis jactitation of the body, owing to the internal disturbance; and\r\naberration of the intellect, and pains; the patient is agitated, and\r\nwishes to vomit, and if he vomits bad matters he is pained; but when\r\nthe heat descends to the feet, and the urine passes freely, he is every\r\nway lightened, even although he does not sweat; at this season, then,\r\nthe ptisan ought to be given; it would be death to give it before.[574]\r\n\r\n8. When the bowels are loose during the whole course of fevers, in\r\nthis case we are most especially to warm the feet, and see that they\r\nare properly treated with cerates, and wrapped in shawls, so that they\r\nmay not become colder than the rest of the body; but when they are\r\nhot, no fomentation must be made to them, but care is to be taken that\r\nthey do not become cold; and very little drink is to be used, either\r\ncold water or hydromel. In those cases of fever where the bowels are\r\nloose, and the mind is disordered, the greater number of patients pick\r\nthe wool from their blankets, scratch their noses, answer briefly when\r\nquestions are put to them, but, when left to themselves, utter nothing\r\nthat is rational. Such attacks appear to me to be connected with black\r\nbile. When in these cases there is a colliquative diarrhœa, I am of\r\nopinion that we ought to give the colder and thicker ptisans, and\r\nthat the drinks ought to be binding, of a vinous nature, and rather\r\nastringent. In cases of fever attended from the first with vertigo,\r\nthrobbing of the head, and thin urine, you may expect the fever to be\r\nexacerbated at the crisis; neither need it excite wonder, although\r\nthere be delirium. When, at the commencement, the urine is cloudy or\r\nthick, it is proper to purge gently, provided this be otherwise proper;\r\nbut when the urine at first is thin, do not purge such patients, but,\r\nif thought necessary, give a clyster: such patients should be thus\r\ntreated; they should be kept in a quiet state, have unguents applied\r\nto them, and be covered up properly with clothes, and they should use\r\nfor drink a watery hydromel, and the juice of ptisan as a draught in\r\nthe evening; clear out the bowels at first with a clyster, but give\r\nno purgative medicines to them, for, if you move the bowels strongly,\r\nthe urine is not concocted, but the fever remains long, without sweats\r\nand without a crisis. Do not give draughts when the time of the crisis\r\nis at hand, if there be agitation, but only when the fever abates\r\nand is alleviated. It is proper to be guarded at the crises of other\r\nfevers, and to withhold the draughts at that season. Fevers of this\r\ndescription are apt to be protracted, and to have determinations, if\r\nthe inferior extremities be cold, about the ears and neck, or, if these\r\nparts are not cold, to have other changes; they have epistaxis, and\r\ndisorder of the bowels. But in cases of fever attended with nausea, or\r\ndistention of the hypochondria, when the patients cannot lie reclined\r\nin the same position, and the extremities are cold, the greatest care\r\nand precaution are necessary; nothing should be given to them, except\r\noxymel diluted with water; no draught should be administered, until the\r\nfever abate and the urine be concocted; the patient should be laid in\r\na dark apartment, and recline upon the softest couch, and he should be\r\nkept as long as possible in the same position, so as not to toss about,\r\nfor this is particularly beneficial to him. Apply to the hypochondrium\r\nlinseed by inunctions, taking care that he do not catch cold when the\r\napplication is made; let it be in a tepid state, and boiled in water\r\nand oil. One may judge from the urine what is to take place, for if\r\nthe urine be thicker, and more yellowish, so much the better; but if\r\nit be thinner, and blacker, so much the worse;[575] but if it undergo\r\nchanges, it indicates a prolongation of the disease, and the patient,\r\nin like manner, must experience a change to the worse and the better.\r\nIrregular fevers should be let alone until they become settled, and,\r\nwhen they do settle, they are to be treated by a suitable diet and\r\nmedicine, attending to the constitution of the patient.\r\n\r\n9. The aspects of the sick are various; wherefore the physician should\r\npay attention, that he may not miss observing the exciting causes,\r\nas far as they can be ascertained by reasoning, nor such symptoms as\r\nshould appear on an even or odd day, but he ought to be particularly\r\nguarded in observing the odd days, as it is in them, more especially,\r\nthat changes take place in patients. He should mark, particularly,\r\nthe first day on which the patient became ill, considering when and\r\nwhence the disease commenced, for this is of primary importance to\r\nknow. When you examine the patient, inquire into all particulars;\r\nfirst how the head is, and if there be no headache, nor heaviness in\r\nit; then examine if the hypochondria and sides be free of pain; for\r\nif the hypochondrium be painful, swelled, and unequal, with a sense\r\nof satiety, or if there be pain in the side, and, along with the\r\npain, either cough, tormina, or belly-ache, if any of these symptoms\r\nbe present in the hypochondrium, the bowels should be opened with\r\nclysters, and the patient should drink boiled hydromel in a hot state.\r\nThe physician should ascertain whether the patient be apt to faint when\r\nhe is raised up, and whether his breathing be free; and examine the\r\ndischarges from the bowels, whether they be very black, or of a proper\r\ncolor, like those of persons in good health, and ascertain whether the\r\nfever has a paroxysm every third day, and look well to such persons\r\non those days. And should the fourth day prove like the third, the\r\npatient is in a dangerous state.[576] With regard to the symptoms,\r\nblack stools prognosticate death; but if they resemble the discharges\r\nof a healthy person, and if such is their appearance every day, it is a\r\nfavorable symptom; but when the bowels do not yield to a suppository,\r\nand when, though the respiration be natural, the patient when raised\r\nto the night-table, or even in bed, be seized with deliquium, you may\r\nexpect that the patient, man or woman, who experiences these symptoms,\r\nis about to fall into a state of delirium. Attention also should be\r\npaid to the hands, for if they tremble, you may expect epistaxis; and\r\nobserve the nostrils, whether the breath be drawn in equally by both;\r\nand if expiration by the nostrils be large, a convulsion is apt to take\r\nplace; and should a convulsion occur to such a person, death may be\r\nanticipated, and it is well to announce it beforehand.\r\n\r\n10. If, in a winter fever, the tongue be rough, and if there be\r\nswoonings, it is likely to be the remission of the fever. Nevertheless\r\nsuch a person is to be kept upon a restricted diet, with water for\r\ndrink, and hydromel, and the strained juices, not trusting to the\r\nremission of the fevers, as persons having these symptoms are in danger\r\nof dying; when, therefore, you perceive these symptoms, announce this\r\nprognostic, if you shall judge proper, after making the suitable\r\nobservations. When, in fevers, any dangerous symptom appears on the\r\nfifth day, when watery discharges suddenly take place from the bowels,\r\nwhen deliquium animi occurs, or the patient is attacked with loss of\r\nspeech, convulsions, or hiccup, under such circumstances he is likely\r\nto be affected with nausea, and sweats break out under the nose and\r\nforehead, or on the back part of the neck and head, and patients with\r\nsuch symptoms shortly die, from stoppage of the respiration.[577]\r\nWhen, in fevers, abscesses form about the legs, and, getting into a\r\nchronic state, are not concocted while the fever persists, and if one\r\nis seized with a sense of suffocation in the throat, while the fauces\r\nare not swelled, and if it do not come to maturation, but is repressed,\r\nin such a case there is apt to be a flow of blood from the nose; if\r\nthis, then, be copious, it indicates a resolution of the disease, but\r\nif not, a prolongation of the complaint; and the less the discharge,\r\nso much worse the symptoms, and the more protracted the disease; but\r\nif the other symptoms are very favorable, expect in such a case that\r\npains will fall upon the feet; if then they attack the feet, and if\r\nthose continue long in a very painful, and inflamed state, and if\r\nthere be no resolution, the pains will extend by degrees to the neck,\r\nto the clavicle, shoulder, breast, or to some articulation, in which\r\nan inflammatory tumour will necessarily form. When these are reduced,\r\nif the hands are contracted, and become trembling, convulsion and\r\ndelirium seize such a person; but blisters break out on the eyebrow,\r\nerythema takes place, the one eyelid being tumefied overtops the other,\r\na hard inflammation sets in, the eye become strongly swelled, and the\r\ndelirium increases much, but makes its attacks rather at night than by\r\nday. These symptoms more frequently occur on odd than on even days,\r\nbut, whether on the one or the other, they are of a fatal character.\r\nShould you determine to give purgative medicines in such cases, at\r\nthe commencement, you should do so before the fifth day, if there be\r\nborborygmi in the bowels, or, if not, you should omit the medicines\r\naltogether. If there be borborygmi, with bilious stools, purge\r\nmoderately with scammony; but with regard to the treatment otherwise,\r\nadminister as few drinks and draughts as possible, until there be some\r\namendment, and the disease is past the fourteenth day. When loss of\r\nspeech seizes a person, on the fourteenth day of a fever, there is\r\nnot usually a speedy resolution, nor any removal of the disease, for\r\nthis symptom indicates a protracted disease; and when it appears on\r\nthat day, it will be still more prolonged. When, on the fourth day of\r\na fever, the tongue articulates confusedly, and when there are watery\r\nand bilious discharges from the bowels, such a patient is apt to fall\r\ninto a state of delirium; the physician ought, therefore, to watch\r\nhim, and attend to whatever symptoms may turn up. In the season of\r\nsummer and autumn an epistaxis, suddenly occurring in acute diseases,\r\nindicates vehemence of the attack, and inflammation in the course of\r\nthe veins, and on the day following, the discharge of thin urine; and\r\nif the patient be in the prime of life, and if his body be strong from\r\nexercise, and brawny, or of a melancholic temperament, or if from\r\ndrinking he has trembling hands, it may be well to announce beforehand\r\neither delirium or convulsion;[578] and if these symptoms occur on even\r\ndays, so much the better; but on critical days, they are of a deadly\r\ncharacter. If, then, a copious discharge of blood procure an issue\r\nto the fullness thereof about the nose, or what is collected about\r\nthe anus, there will be an abscess, or pains in the hypochondrium, or\r\ntesticles, or in the limbs; and when these are resolved, there will\r\nbe a discharge of thick sputa, and of smooth, thin urine. In fever\r\nattended with singultus, give asafœtida, oxymel, and carrot, triturated\r\ntogether, in a draught; or galbanum in honey, and cumin in a linctus,\r\nor the juice of ptisan. Such a person cannot escape, unless critical\r\nsweats and gentle sleep supervene, and thick and acrid urine be passed,\r\nor the disease terminate in an abscess: give pine-fruit[579] and myrrh\r\nin a linctus, and further give a very little oxymel to drink; but if\r\nthey are very thirsty, some barley-water.\r\n\r\n11. Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed:\r\nIf the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in\r\nboth, and if expiration be attended with pain, if cough be present, and\r\nthe sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin,\r\nfrothy, and florid, or having any other character different from the\r\ncommon, in such a case, the physician should proceed thus: if the pain\r\npass upward to the clavicle, or the breast, or the arm, the inner vein\r\nin the arm should be opened on the side affected, and blood abstracted\r\naccording to the habit, age, and color of the patient, and the season\r\nof the year, and that largely and boldly, if the pain be acute, so as\r\nto bring on deliquium animi,[580] and afterwards a clyster is to be\r\ngiven. But if the pain be below the chest, and if very intense, purge\r\nthe bowels gently in such an attack of pleurisy, and during the act of\r\npurging give nothing; but after the purging give oxymel. The medicine\r\nis to be administered on the fourth day; on the first three days after\r\nthe commencement, a clyster should be given, and if it does not relieve\r\nthe patient, he should then be gently purged, but he is to be watched\r\nuntil the fever goes off, and till the seventh day; then if he appear\r\nto be free from danger, give him some unstrained ptisan, in small\r\nquantity, and thin at first, mixing it with honey. If the expectoration\r\nbe easy, and the breathing free, if his sides be free of pain, and\r\nif the fever be gone, he may take the ptisan thicker, and in larger\r\nquantity, twice a day. But if he do not progress favorably, he must\r\nget less of the drink, and of the draught, which should be thin, and\r\nonly given once a day, at whatever is judged to be the most favorable\r\nhour; this you will ascertain from the urine. The draught is not to be\r\ngiven to persons after fever, until you see that the urine and sputa\r\nare concocted, (if, indeed, after the administration of the medicine he\r\nbe purged frequently, it may be necessary to give it, but it should be\r\ngiven in smaller quantities and thinner than usual, for from inanition\r\nhe will be unable to sleep, or digest properly, or wait the crisis;)\r\nbut when the melting down of crude matters has taken place, and his\r\nsystem has cast off what is offensive, there will then be no objection.\r\nThe sputa are concocted when they resemble pus, and the urine when\r\nit has reddish sediments like tares. But there is nothing to prevent\r\nfomentation and cerates being applied for the other pains of the sides;\r\nand the legs and loins may be rubbed with hot oil, or anointed with\r\nfat; linseed, too, in the form of a cataplasm, may be applied to the\r\nhypochondrium and as far up as the breasts. When pneumonia is at its\r\nheight, the case is beyond remedy if he is not purged, and it is bad if\r\nhe has dyspnœa, and urine that is thin and acrid, and if sweats come\r\nout about the neck and head, for such sweats are bad, as proceeding\r\nfrom the suffocation, _râles_, and the violence of the disease\r\nwhich is obtaining the upper hand, unless there be a copious evacuation\r\nof thick urine, and the sputa be concocted; when either of these come\r\non spontaneously, that will carry off the disease. A linctus for\r\npneumonia: Galbanum and pine-fruit in Attic honey; and southernwood in\r\noxymel; make a decoction of pepper and black hellebore, and give it in\r\ncases of pleurisy attended with violent pain at the commencement. It is\r\nalso a good thing to boil opoponax in oxymel, and, having strained it,\r\nto give it to drink; it answers well, also, in diseases of the liver,\r\nand in severe pains proceeding from the diaphragm, and in all cases in\r\nwhich it is beneficial to determine to the bowels or urinary organs,\r\nwhen given in wine and honey; when given to act upon the bowels, it\r\nshould be drunk in larger quantity, along with a watery hydromel.\r\n\r\n12. A dysentery, when stopped, will give rise to an aposteme, or\r\ntumour, if it do not terminate in fevers with sweats, or with thick and\r\nwhite urine, or in a tertian fever, or the pain fix upon a varix, or\r\nthe testicles, or on the hip-joints.[581]\r\n\r\n13. In a bilious fever, jaundice coming on with rigor before the\r\nseventh day carries off the fever, but if it occur without the fever,\r\nand not at the proper time, it is a fatal symptom.\r\n\r\n14. When the loins are in a tetanic state, and the spirits in the\r\nveins are obstructed by melancholic humors, venesection will afford\r\nrelief.[582] But when, on the other hand, the anterior tendons are\r\nstrongly contracted, and if there be sweats about the neck and face,\r\nextorted by the violent pain of the parched and dried tendons of the\r\nsacral extremity (these are very thick, sustaining the spine, and\r\ngiving rise to very great ligaments, which terminate in the feet,) in\r\nsuch a case, unless fever and sleep come on, followed by concocted\r\nurine and critical sweats, give to drink a strong Cretan wine, and\r\nboiled barley-meal for food; anoint and rub with ointments containing\r\nwax; bathe the legs and feet in hot water, and then cover them up; and\r\nso in like manner the arms, as far as the hands, and the spine, from\r\nthe neck to the sacrum, are to be wrapped in a skin smeared with wax;\r\nthis must extend to the parts beyond, and intervals are to be left for\r\napplying fomentations, by means of leather bottles filled with hot\r\nwater, then, wrapping him up in a linen cloth, lay him down in bed. Do\r\nnot open the bowels, unless by means of a suppository, when they have\r\nbeen long of being moved. If there be any remission of the disease, so\r\nfar well, but otherwise, pound of the root of bryonia[583] in fragrant\r\nwine, and that of the carrot, and give to the patient fasting early\r\nin the morning, before using the affusion, and immediately afterwards\r\nlet him eat boiled barley-meal in a tepid state, and as much as he can\r\ntake, and in addition let him drink, if he will, wine well diluted.\r\nIf the disease yield to these means, so much the better, but, if\r\notherwise, you must prognosticate accordingly.\r\n\r\n15. All diseases are resolved either by the mouth, the bowels, the\r\nbladder, or some other such organ. Sweat is a common form of resolution\r\nin all these cases.[584]\r\n\r\n16. You should put persons on a course of hellebore who are troubled\r\nwith a defluxion from the head. But do not administer hellebore to\r\nsuch persons as are laboring under empyema connected with abscesses,\r\nhæmoptysis, and intemperament, or any other strong cause, for it will\r\ndo no good; and if anything unpleasant occur the hellebore will get\r\nthe blame of it. But if the body have suddenly lost its powers, or if\r\nthere be pain in the head, or obstruction of the ears and nose, or\r\nptyalism, or heaviness of the limbs, or an extraordinary swelling of\r\nthe body, you may administer the hellebore, provided these symptoms\r\nbe not connected with drinking, nor with immoderate venery; nor with\r\nsorrow, vexation, nor insomnolency, for, if any of these causes exist,\r\nthe treatment must have respect to it.\r\n\r\n17. From walking arise pains of the sides, of the back, of the loins,\r\nand of the hip-joint, and disorder of the respiration has often been\r\nfrom the same cause, for, after excesses of wine and flatulent food,\r\npains shoot to the loins and hips, accompanied with dysuria.[585]\r\nWalking is the cause of such complaints, and also of coryza and\r\nhoarseness.\r\n\r\n18. Disorders connected with regimen, for the most part, make their\r\nattack accordingly as any one has changed his habitual mode of\r\ndiet.[586] For persons who dine contrary to custom experience much\r\nswelling of the stomach, drowsiness, and fullness; and if they take\r\nsupper over and above, their belly is disordered; such persons will be\r\nbenefited by sleeping after taking the bath, and by walking slowly for\r\na considerable time after sleep; if, then, the bowels be moved, he may\r\ndine and drink a small quantity of wine not much diluted; but if the\r\nbowels are not opened, he should get his body rubbed with hot oil, and,\r\nif thirsty, drink of some weak and white wine, or a sweet wine, and\r\ntake repose; if he does not sleep he should repose the longer. In other\r\nrespects he should observe the regimen laid down for those who have\r\ntaken a debauch. With regard to the bad effects of drinks, such as are\r\nof a watery nature pass more slowly through the body, they regurgitate,\r\nas it were, and float about the hypochondria, and do not flow readily\r\nby urine; when filled up with such a drink, he should not attempt any\r\nviolent exertion, requiring either strength or swiftness, but should\r\nrest as much as possible until the drink has been digested along with\r\nthe food; but such drinks as are stronger or more austere, occasion\r\npalpitation in the body and throbbing in the head, and in this case\r\nthe person affected will do well to sleep, and take some hot draught\r\nfor which he feels disposed; for abstinence is bad in headache and the\r\neffects of a surfeit. Those who, contrary to usage, restrict themselves\r\nto one meal, feel empty and feeble, and pass hot urine in consequence\r\nof the emptiness of their vessels; they have a salt and bitter taste in\r\nthe mouth; they tremble at any work they attempt; their temples throb;\r\nand they cannot digest their supper so well as if they had previously\r\ntaken their dinner. Such persons should take less supper than they are\r\nwont, and a pudding of barley-meal more moist than usual instead of\r\nbread, and of potherbs the dock, or mallow, and ptisan, or beets, and\r\nalong with the food they should take wine in moderation, and diluted\r\nwith water; after supper they should take a short walk, until the urine\r\ndescend and be passed; and they may use boiled fish.\r\n\r\nArticles of food have generally such effects as the following:[587]\r\nGarlic occasions flatulence and heat about the chest, heaviness of the\r\nhead, and nausea, and any other habitual pain is apt to be exasperated\r\nby it; it is diuretic, which, in so far, is a good property which it\r\npossesses; but it is best to eat it when one means to drink to excess,\r\nor when intoxicated. Cheese produces flatulence and constipation, and\r\nheats the other articles of food; and it gives rise to crudities and\r\nindigestion, but it is worst of all to eat it along with drink after\r\na full meal. Pulse of all kinds are flatulent, whether raw, boiled,\r\nor fried; least so when macerated in water, or in a green state; they\r\nshould not be used except along with food prepared from the cerealia.\r\nEach of these articles, however, has bad effects peculiar to itself.\r\nThe vetch, whether raw or boiled, creates flatulence and pain. The\r\nlentil is astringent, and disorders the stomach if taken with its\r\nhull. The lupine has the fewest bad effects of all these things. The\r\nstalk and the juice of silphium (_asafœtida_), pass through some\r\npeople’s bowels very readily, but in others, not accustomed to them,\r\nthey engender what is called dry cholera;[588] this complaint is more\r\nespecially produced by it if mixed with much cheese, or eaten along\r\nwith beef. Melancholic diseases are most particularly exacerbated by\r\nbeef, for it is of an unmanageable nature, and requires no ordinary\r\npowers of stomach to digest it; it will agree best with those who use\r\nit well boiled and pretty long kept. Goat’s flesh has all the bad\r\nproperties of beef; it is as indigestible, more flatulent and engenders\r\nacid eructations and cholera; such as has a fragrant smell, is firm,\r\nand sweet to the taste, is the best, when well baked and cooled; but\r\nthose kinds which are disagreeable to the taste, have a bad smell, and\r\nare hard, such are particularly bad, and especially if very fresh; it\r\nis best in summer and worst in autumn. The flesh of young pigs is bad,\r\neither when it is too raw or when it is over-roasted, for it engenders\r\nbile and disorders the bowels. Of all kinds of flesh, pork is the best;\r\nit is best when neither very fat, nor, on the other hand, very lean,\r\nand the animal had not attained the age of what is reckoned an old\r\nvictim; it should be eaten without the skin, and in a coldish state.\r\n\r\n19. In dry cholera the belly is distended with wind, there is rumbling\r\nin the bowels, pain in the sides and loins, no dejections, but, on the\r\ncontrary, the bowels are constipated. In such a case you should guard\r\nagainst vomiting, but endeavor to get the bowels opened. As quickly\r\nas possible give a clyster of hot water with plenty of oil in it, and\r\nhaving rubbed the patient freely with unguents, put him into hot water,\r\nlaying him down in the basin, and pouring the hot water upon him by\r\ndegrees; and if, when heated in the bath, the bowels be moved, he will\r\nbe freed from the complaint. To a person in such a complaint it will\r\ndo good if he sleep, and drink a thin, old, and strong wine; and you\r\nshould give him oil, so that he may settle, and have his bowels moved,\r\nwhen he will be relieved. He must abstain from all other kinds of food;\r\nbut when the pain remits, give him asses’ milk to drink until he is\r\npurged. But if the bowels are loose, with bilious discharges, tormina,\r\nvomitings, a feeling of suffocation, and gnawing pains, it is best to\r\nenjoin repose, and to drink hydromel, and avoid vomiting.\r\n\r\n20. There are two kinds of dropsy, the one anasarca, which, when\r\nformed, is incurable; the other is accompanied with emphysema\r\n(tympanites?) and requires much good fortune to enable one to triumph\r\nover it.[589] Laborious exertion, fomentation, and abstinence (are to\r\nbe enjoined). The patient should eat dry and acrid things, for thus\r\nwill he pass the more water, and his strength be kept up. If he labors\r\nunder difficulty of breathing, if it is the summer season, and if he is\r\nin the prime of life, and is strong, blood should be abstracted from\r\nthe arm, and then he should eat hot pieces of bread, dipped in dark\r\nwine and oil, drink very little, and labor much, and live on well-fed\r\npork, boiled with vinegar, so that he may be able to endure hard\r\nexercises.[590]\r\n\r\n21. Those who have the inferior intestines hot, and who pass acrid and\r\nirregular stools of a colliquative nature, if they can bear it, should\r\nprocure revulsion by vomiting with hellebore; but if not, should get\r\na thick decoction of summer wheat in a cold state, lentil soup, bread\r\ncooked with cinders, and fish, which should be taken boiled if they\r\nhave fever, but roasted if not feverish; and also dark-colored wine if\r\nfree of fever; but otherwise they should take the water from medlars,\r\nmyrtles, apples, services, dates, or wild vine. If there be no fever,\r\nand if there be tormina, the patient should drink hot asses’ milk in\r\nsmall quantity at first, and gradually increase it, and linseed, and\r\nwheaten flour, and having removed the bitter part of Egyptian beans,\r\nand ground them, sprinkle on the milk and drink; and let him eat eggs\r\nhalf-roasted, and fine flour, and millet, and perl-spelt (chondrus)\r\nboiled in milk;--all these things should be eaten cold, and similar\r\narticles of food and drink should be administered.\r\n\r\n22. The most important point of regimen to observe and be guarded about\r\nin protracted diseases, is to pay attention to the exacerbations and\r\nremissions of fevers, so as to avoid the times when food should not be\r\ngiven, and to know when it may be administered without danger; this\r\nlast season is at the greatest possible distance from the exacerbation.\r\n\r\n23. One should be able to recognize those who have headache from\r\ngymnastic exercises, or running, or walking or hunting, or any other\r\nunseasonable labour, or from immoderate venery; also those who are of\r\na pale colour, or troubled with hoarseness; those who have enlarged\r\nspleen, those who are in a state of anæmia, those who are suffering\r\nfrom tympanites, those having dry cough and thirst, those who are\r\nflatulent, and have the course of the blood in their veins intercepted;\r\nthose persons whose hypochondria, sides, and back are distended; those\r\nhaving torpor; those laboring under amaurosis, or having noises in\r\ntheir ears; those suffering from incontinence of urine or jaundice, or\r\nwhose food is passed undigested; those who have discharges of blood\r\nfrom the nose or anus, or who have flatulence and intense pain, and who\r\ncannot retain the wind. In these cases you may do mischief, but cannot\r\npossibly do any good by purging, but may interrupt the spontaneous\r\nremissions and crises of the complaints.[591]\r\n\r\n24. If you think it expedient to let blood, see that the bowels be\r\npreviously settled, and then bleed; enjoin abstinence, and forbid the\r\nuse of wine; and complete the cure by means of a suitable regimen, and\r\nwet fomentations.[592] But if the bowels appear to be constipated,\r\nadminister a soothing clyster.\r\n\r\n25.[593] If you think it necessary to give medicines, you may safely\r\npurge upwards by hellebore, but none of those should be purged\r\ndownwards. The most effectual mode of treatment is by the urine,\r\nsweats, and exercise; and use gentle friction so as not to harden the\r\nconstitution; and if he be confined to bed let others rub him. When\r\nthe pain is seated above the diaphragm, place him erect for the most\r\npart, and let him be as little reclined as possible; and when he is\r\nraised up let him be rubbed for a considerable time with plenty of hot\r\noil. But if the pains be in the lower belly below the diaphragm, it\r\nwill be useful to lie reclined and make no motion, and to such a person\r\nnothing should be administered except the friction. Those pains which\r\nare dissolved by discharges from the bowels, by urine, or moderate\r\nsweats, cease spontaneously, if they are slight, but if strong they\r\nprove troublesome; for persons so affected either die, or at least do\r\nnot recover without further mischief, for they terminate in abscesses.\r\n\r\n26. _A draught for a dropsical person._ Take three cantharides,[594]\r\nand removing their head, feet, and wings, triturate their bodies in\r\nthree cupfuls (cyathi) of water, and when the person who has drunk the\r\ndraught complains of pain, let him have hot fomentations applied. The\r\npatient should be first anointed with oil, should take the draught\r\nfasting, and eat hot bread with oil.\r\n\r\n27.[595] _A styptic._ Apply the juice of the fig inwardly to\r\nthe vein; or having moulded biestings into a tent, introduce up the\r\nnostril, or push up some chalcitis with the finger, and press the\r\ncartilages of the nostrils together; and open the bowels with the\r\nboiled milk of asses: or having shaved the head apply cold things to it\r\nif in the summer season.\r\n\r\n28. The sesamoides[596] purges upwards when pounded in oxymel to the\r\namount of a drachm and a half, and drunk; it is combined with the\r\nhellebores, to the amount of the third part, and thus it is less apt to\r\nproduce suffocation.\r\n\r\n29. _Trichiasis._ Having introduced a thread into the eye of a\r\nneedle push it through the upper part of the distended eyelid, and do\r\nthe same at the base of it; having stretched the threads tie a knot on\r\nthem, and bind up until they drop out: and, if this be sufficient, so\r\nfar well; but if otherwise, you must do the same thing again.[597] And\r\nhemorrhoids, in like manner, you may treat by transfixing them with a\r\nneedle and tying them with a very thick and large woolen thread; for\r\nthus the cure will be more certain. When you have secured them, use a\r\nseptic application, and do not foment until they drop off, and always\r\nleave one behind; and when the patient recovers, let him be put upon\r\na course of hellebore. Then let him be exercised and sweated; the\r\nfriction of the gymnasium and wrestling in the morning will be proper;\r\nbut he must abstain from running, drinking, and all acrid substances,\r\nexcept marjoram; let him take an emetic every seven days, or three\r\ntimes in a month; for thus will he enjoy the best bodily health. Let\r\nhim take straw-colored, austere, and watery wine, and use little drink.\r\n\r\n30. _For persons affected with empyema._ Having cut some bulbs\r\nor squill, boil in water, and when well boiled, throw this away, and\r\nhaving poured in more water, boil until it appear to the touch soft and\r\nwell-boiled; then triturate finely and mix roasted cumin, and white\r\nsesames, and young almonds pounded in honey, form into an electuary\r\nand give; and afterwards sweet wine. In draughts, having pounded about\r\na small acetabulum of the white poppy, moisten it with water in which\r\nsummer wheat has been washed, add honey, and boil. Let him take this\r\nfrequently during the day. And then taking into account what are to\r\nhappen, give him supper.\r\n\r\n31. _For dysentery._ A fourth part of a pound of cleaned beans,\r\nand twelve shoots of madder having been triturated, are to be mixed\r\ntogether and boiled, and given as a linctus with some fatty substance.\r\n\r\n32. _For diseases of the eyes._ Washed spodium (tutty?) mixed\r\nwith grease, and not of a thinner consistence than dough, is to be\r\ncarefully triturated, and moistened with the juice of unripe raisins;\r\nand having dried in the sun, moisten until it is of the consistence of\r\nan ointment. When it becomes again dry, let it be finely levigated,\r\nanoint the eyes with it, and dust it upon the angles of the eyes.\r\n\r\n33. _For watery eyes._ Take one drachm of ebony and nine oboli of\r\nburnt copper, rub them upon a whetstone, add three oboli of saffron;\r\ntriturate all these things reduced to a fine powder, pour in an Attic\r\nhemina of sweet wine, and then place in the sun and cover up; when\r\nsufficiently digested, use it.[598]\r\n\r\n34. _For violent pains of the eyes._ Take of chalcitis,[599] and\r\nof raisin, of each 1 dr., when digested for two days, strain; and\r\npounding myrrh and saffron, and having mixed must, with these things,\r\ndigest in the sun; and with this anoint the eyes when in a state of\r\nsevere pain. Let it be kept in a copper vessel.\r\n\r\n35. _Mode of distinguishing persons in an hysterical fit._ Pinch\r\nthem with your fingers, and if they feel, it is hysterical; but if not,\r\nit is a convulsion.\r\n\r\n36. _To persons in coma_, (dropsy?) give to drink meconium (_euphorbia\r\npeplus?_) to the amount of a round Attic _leciskion_ (small\r\nacetabulum[600]).\r\n\r\n37. Of squama æris, as much as three specilla can contain, with the\r\ngluten of summer wheat: levigate, pound, form into pills, and give; it\r\npurges water downwards.\r\n\r\n38. _A medicine for opening the bowels._ Pour upon figs the juice\r\nof spurge, in the proportion of seven to one: then put into a new\r\nvessel and lay past when properly mixed. Give before food.\r\n\r\n39. Pounding meconium, pouring on it water, and straining, and\r\nmixing flour, and baking into a cake, with the addition of boiled\r\nhoney, give in affections of the anus and in dropsy; and after eating\r\nof it, let the patient drink of a sweet watery wine, and diluted\r\nhydromel prepared from wax: or collecting meconium, lay it up for\r\nmedicinal purposes.[601]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FIRST AND THIRD BOOKS\r\n\r\n                                  OF\r\n\r\n                            THE EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOOK I.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nThe ancient physicians commonly used the term Epidemic in the same\r\nsense as it is understood now, that is to say, as applying to any\r\ndisease which attacks a multitude of persons in a locality at any\r\nparticular period. This, as will be seen in our annotations below, is\r\nnearly the definition which Galen gives of it; and it is generally\r\nused by Hippocrates, in the first and third books of the “Epidemics,”\r\nin pretty much the same sense as it is used by our great modern\r\nauthority on epidemics, Sydenham. But, although this be the strict\r\nsense in which the ancient authorities use the term, it must be borne\r\nin mind that, as applied to the whole seven books of the “Epidemics,”\r\nit must be taken in a much wider signification; for there are many\r\nthings treated of in them to which the term epidemic can by no means\r\nbe thus applied, such as surgical cases, fragments of anatomical\r\ndescriptions, philosophical speculations, empirical remedies, general\r\nreflections on various topics, and so forth. In fact, the work entitled\r\n“The Books of Epidemics” can be viewed in no other light than as an\r\n_Adversaria_, or _Memorandum Book_, in which is collected\r\na variety of isolated facts and detached observations, to serve as\r\nthe materials for more elaborate and finished works on professional\r\nsubjects. Indeed, Galen does not hesitate to give it as his opinion,\r\nthat some of the most celebrated of our author’s productions, such\r\nas the “Aphorisms” and “Prognostics,” are in a great measure made up\r\nfrom the materials originally laid up in this capacious repertory of\r\nobservations;[602] and, with regard to the former of these works,\r\nthere is no person familiarly acquainted with it but must admit the\r\ntruth of Galen’s remark. But, respecting the other, although it\r\nmust be obvious, upon a comparison of them, that there is a close\r\nconnection between it and the “Epidemics,” there can be no doubt that,\r\nin composing the “Prognostics,” Hippocrates availed himself of other\r\nmaterials ready prepared for his use, in the “Prorrhetics” and “Coan\r\nPrænotions” of his predecessors, the Asclepiadæ;[603] so that, of all\r\nhis admired productions, it, perhaps, is the one which has the least\r\npretension to any originality of matter. If it be thought strange that\r\nthe term epidemics should have been applied to a work composed of\r\nsuch heterogeneous materials, I would remark, in explanation, that,\r\nalthough the subject-matters of which it consists are not all of this\r\nnature, the most valuable portion of them refers to epidemics, and it\r\nis not to be wondered at that the whole collection should have got its\r\nappellation from the most prominent subject to which it relates.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give a succinct analysis of the various subjects\r\nwhich are contained in the First and Third Books of the “Epidemics.”\r\n\r\nThe first book opens with a description of the leading phenomena of\r\na certain season, which is called the First Constitution; it was\r\nsoutherly, coldish, rainy, clouded and misty, with some intervals of\r\ndrought. The most noted diseases of spring in this constitution were\r\ncausus and an epidemical parotitis. But the most important subject\r\nwhich is handled under this head, is an epidemic phthisis, of which a\r\nvery interesting description is given.\r\n\r\nThe Second Constitution is described as being northerly and humid;\r\nhumid ophthalmies, dysenteries, and diarrhœas are described among the\r\nprevailing diseases of the season; but the most marked affection which\r\nis said to have occurred in this constitution, is a continual fever\r\nof a serious character, which did not come to a crisis until after it\r\nhad run a long course. It is described as passing off by deposits, and\r\nprincipally by dropsies, and an affection of the urinary organs. One\r\ncannot help being struck with the remark which Hippocrates makes, that\r\nhe never knew a case prove fatal in which the strangury supervened.\r\nThe directions as to the treatment he condenses into one general rule,\r\nwhich well deserves to be engraved in letters of gold, that “_the aim\r\nof the physician should be to do good to his patient, or, at least, to\r\ndo no harm_.” The description of this constitution concludes with\r\nsome general reflections on the prognostics in causus and phrenitis.\r\n\r\nThe Third Constitution is described as being of a very variable\r\ncharacter; winter stormy, spring rainy, summer hot, autumn cold and\r\ndry. The ardent fevers (_or_ causi) began early in the season, but\r\ndid not assume a fatal character until autumn. This disease came to a\r\ncrisis in four modes--by an epistaxis, by a copious flow of urine, by a\r\ndeposit, or by an alvine discharge. In women, there was also sometimes\r\na crisis by menstruation.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Constitution is one which, by Galen and the other\r\nauthorities, has been entitled the pestilential, and has attracted\r\ngreat attention, as being supposed to have derived its peculiar\r\ncharacters from the great Plague which prevailed during the\r\nPeloponnesian war, and which is described in so interesting a manner\r\nby Thucydides. Galen, not only in his Commentary, but in various\r\nother parts of his works, advocates this opinion, and it will be seen\r\nfrom what is stated in our annotations, that there is in reality a\r\nstriking resemblance between the features of the plague, as delineated\r\nby Thucydides, and the epidemical diseases which are noticed by\r\nHippocrates as having prevailed during this constitution. Of all the\r\ndiseases here described the most remarkable is the erysipelas, which,\r\nalthough not of a very fatal character, was still of a formidable\r\nnature, as it frequently terminated in gangrene. Causus, phrenitis, and\r\nanthrax are also described as being common under this constitution. The\r\nlast of these being a well-known symptom of the Oriental plague, it has\r\nnaturally excited a good deal of speculation to determine whether or\r\nnot our author here refers to the glandular plague. See our remarks on\r\nEpidem. III.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn these books it is remarkable that phthisis is treated of as a\r\nfebrile disease, and in particular as supervening upon attacks of the\r\nsemitertian. There seems reason to suppose that our author means to\r\ndescribe a hectic fever succeeding to intermittents, which had caused\r\norganic derangement of the internal viscera, more especially of the\r\nliver and spleen. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 32.\r\n\r\nIn the first book, fourteen cases of disease are related, and in the\r\nbeginning of the third twelve, and sixteen in the end; thus making\r\nforty-two in all. It is worthy of remark, that in twenty-five of these\r\nthe result was fatal. There is every reason, then, to suppose that\r\nthey were selected for a purpose, but what that purpose was cannot now\r\nbe easily determined. The most natural would, no doubt, have been to\r\nillustrate, by examples, the forms of the different diseases which are\r\ndescribed as occurring during the Constitutions previously described.\r\nBut there seems to be little or no reason to suppose that this is the\r\nobject for which they are related. In proof of this, I may mention\r\nthat there is not in the collection a single case of the epidemical\r\nerysipelas which is described as having been the prevailing disease\r\nduring the fourth Constitution. Indeed it must strike everybody, who\r\nreads them carefully, as a singular feature in these cases, that the\r\nlineaments of a particular disease are seldom to be recognized, and\r\nthis perhaps may be regarded as a proof of the faithfulness with which\r\nthey have been copied from nature. In short, we here recognize the\r\nfeatures of disease in the concrete, and not in the abstract. And is\r\nnot this what we should expect in all true copies from Nature? How\r\noften does the candid physician find himself forced honestly to admit\r\nthat he is at a loss what name to give to the combination of morbid\r\nactions which he is called upon to treat! The common herd of mankind\r\nwould seem to fancy, as in Nature there are certain types of all\r\nanimal and vegetable substances, and the botanist has no difficulty in\r\nclassing such a plant, for example, as the _conium maculatum_;\r\nand the natural historian can readily pronounce that such a bird is\r\nthe _alcedo Ispida_; that the physician, in like manner, upon\r\nexamining the characteristic features of any case, should have no\r\ndifficulty in pronouncing that it is _pleuritis_, for example,\r\nor _pneumonia_, or the like. But how often does it happen, that\r\nthe complaint in question is an aggregate of symptoms, produced by\r\npeculiarities of constitution, and incidental circumstances, which,\r\ntaken together, constitute an _ensemble_ which does not well admit\r\nof being referred to any one of the general forms of disease described\r\nin our nosological systems? Now, I say the most wonderful feature in\r\nthe cases related by Hippocrates, is that they are descriptive of the\r\nsymptoms observed in certain diseased individuals, instead of being,\r\nwhat most modern cases are, symptoms drawn to correspond with certain\r\nideal forms of disease. What, in my opinion, likewise adds very much\r\nto the value of these cases is, that (as Galen somewhere remarks in\r\nhis Commentary) the author never aimed to make his Books of Epidemics\r\na work on Therapeutics, and hence, in noting morbid phenomena, his\r\nmind in not warped by any particular hypothesis, nor by any selfish\r\ninterest, in order to place some favorite mode of practice, advocated\r\nby himself, in a favorable light. May I be permitted here to remark,\r\nthat the reader will be much struck with our author’s admirable\r\ntalent for describing the phenomena of disease as they are actually\r\npresented to us, if he will compare the case related by him in these\r\ntwo books with those of almost any modern authority whatever;--for\r\nexample, with those related by the late Dr. James Hamilton, in his\r\ncelebrated work on Purgative Medicines. In the latter, you look\r\nin vain for the strongly-marked features which present themselves\r\nin all the cases related by our author,--for a description of the\r\ncondition of the hypochondriac region,--of the state of the animal\r\nheat in the extremities,--of the minute characters of the alvine and\r\nurinary discharges,--of the respiration,--of the patients’ position\r\nin bed,--and many other symptoms, which are invariably noticed by\r\nHippocrates. And what reasonable person will venture to deny, that\r\nthe symptoms I have just now mentioned are most important features in\r\nevery febrile disease, and that no one can be said to have a sufficient\r\nview of such a case, who does not take these into account? To confine\r\nour attention at present to only one of these symptoms,--can it ever\r\nbe a matter of indifference what are the physical characters of so\r\nimportant an excretion as the urine? that is to say, whether the\r\ngrosser particles of it, which usually fall to the bottom, be present\r\nin the urine or not? Yet in all the seventeen cases related in the\r\nmodern work just now referred to, the characters of the urine are not\r\ngiven in a single instance. And although the object of the writer is\r\nto enforce his own peculiar views, as to the utility of purgative\r\nmedicines in this disease, he scarcely ever gives the minute characters\r\nof the alvine discharges, as is uniformly the case with Hippocrates;\r\nor if they are noticed at all, it is in so confused a manner that\r\nthe reader is at a loss to determine whether they are produced by\r\nthe disease, or by the medicines which have been administered. For\r\nthe issue of the case no obvious cause is stated, but the reader is\r\nexpected to draw the conclusion that, as purgatives were freely given,\r\nand a considerable proportion of the cases did well,--(agreeably to the\r\nhackneyed rule, _post quod, ergo propter quod_,)--the purgatives\r\nbrought about the fortunate result. Had the cases been fully and\r\ncircumstantially detailed, it might have been found that, as in those\r\nrelated by Hippocrates, recovery was preceded by a critical discharge\r\nof urine, accompanied with a copious sediment; and then the more\r\nprobable inference would have been, that the amendment was referable to\r\n_it_, and not to the purgative medicines which were administered.\r\nIt is, I regret to say, a notable example of the want of logical\r\ntraining in the education of professional men, in the present age, that\r\ninferences regarding a peculiar method of practice were allowed to be\r\nfounded upon narratives of observations so defective and one-sided as\r\nthose I refer to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot quit the present subject of discussion, without saying a\r\nfew words in reference to what must strike the reader as a singular\r\nfeature in the cases related in the books of the Epidemics; I mean the\r\ngeneral omission of any mention of treatment. The reader will find in\r\nour annotations various remarks of Galen on this head, from which he\r\nwill learn that the Great Commentator inclines to the opinion, that in\r\nall these cases the usual routine of practice was followed, but that\r\nno mention is made of medicines, unless when there was some deviation\r\nfrom the established rules. For example, in a certain febrile case,\r\nit is stated that the patient was bled on the eighth day, and Galen\r\ncontends that venesection is noticed in this instance, merely because\r\nit was contrary to the established rule of not bleeding after the\r\nfourth day; for that if the practice had been in accordance with the\r\ngeneral rule, it would not have been noticed at all. Now it must be\r\nadmitted, that this supposition is by no means improbable, and that\r\nexamples of this usage are not wanting, even in the modern literature\r\nof medicine. To give an example, which just occurs to me; in not a\r\nfew of the cases of cerebral disease related by Dr. Abercrombie, in\r\nhis work “On the Brain,” there is no allusion whatever to remedies,\r\nalthough no one, who recollects the vigorous system of treatment then\r\npursued by the profession in “Modern Athens,” will doubt for a moment\r\nthat they must have been applied. As this eminent authority, then,\r\nwhen he believed that the treatment had no perceptible effect on the\r\ncourse which the disease ran, thought himself warranted in omitting all\r\nmention of it, it might be supposed, in like manner, that Hippocrates\r\nmay have passed over the remedies applied, from some such motive or\r\nconsideration. But another reason for the absence of remedies in these\r\nReports may be readily supposed. May not Hippocrates have been at first\r\nquite undecided what was the proper plan of treatment to be adopted\r\nin those cases, and thought it the wisest course to attempt nothing\r\nrashly, but to be for a season the quiet spectator of the course\r\nwhich the diseases in question were naturally disposed to run, before\r\nattempting to interfere in the struggle between morbific agents with\r\nwhich he was imperfectly acquainted, and their great physician, as\r\nhe held Nature to be?[604] And however much the advocates for a bold\r\nsystem of treating diseases may be disposed to deride this expectant\r\nmethod, which Asclepiades contemptuously denominated “the contemplation\r\nof death,”[605] it does not want the sanction of a name which is\r\nsecond only to Hippocrates in the literature of epidemical fevers.\r\nSydenham admits, that with all the diligence which he had applied to\r\nthe study of these diseases, he was always greatly puzzled what plan\r\nof treatment to adopt at the first breaking out of a new epidemic, and\r\nthat it was only “ingenti adhibita cautela intentisque animi nervis,”\r\nthat he could make up his mind what course of treatment to adopt in\r\nsuch an emergency. Need it be wondered at, then, that two thousand\r\nyears earlier the modest mind of our great author should have hesitated\r\nfor a time, before deciding how to act under similar circumstances? I\r\nmust own, therefore, that I have long inclined to the opinion, that,\r\ndistracted with the conflicting plans of treatment adopted by his\r\ncontemporaries, Hippocrates at first did little or nothing in the\r\ntreatment of epidemical fevers, and that it was only after a patient\r\nstudy of their symptoms, and many cautious trials, that he ventured to\r\nlay down those excellent rules of treatment which he has described so\r\nadmirably in his work “On Regimen in Acute Diseases.” This, however, is\r\nmerely my individual opinion, and the reader must receive it as such.\r\n\r\nM. Littré, in the Argument prefixed to his translation of the\r\nEpidemics, enters very fully into the discussion of the question\r\nregarding the nature of the diseases which are treated of in the course\r\nof this work. This is a task, however, which I deem it superfluous to\r\nundertake at any length, as I have stated my opinions on this subject\r\nin the Commentaries on the Second Book of PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nand after maturely weighing what has been elicited by subsequent\r\ninquirers, I find no cause to retract any of the opinions which are\r\nthere advanced. That the causus of Hippocrates, and the other ancient\r\nauthorities, was not the typhus of the more temperate parts of Europe,\r\nbut a bilious fever, of the remittent type, must be quite apparent\r\nto every person at all acquainted with the medical literature of\r\nfebrile diseases. M. Littré’s researches lead him to exactly the same\r\nconclusion, and much deference is due to his judgment in this case,\r\nas it must be admitted that a French physician is now very favorably\r\nsituated for contrasting the diseases of temperate and hot climates,\r\nowing to the familiar intercourse which at present subsists between\r\nParis and Algiers. Of all the materials which he has collected from\r\nthe observations of French physicians in Algeria, the most interesting\r\nare those which he draws from a work on Fevers, by M. Maillot. The\r\ndescription which is there given of “la fièvre algide,” is so striking,\r\nand is so much calculated to illustrate the nature of the fevers which\r\nare treated of in this work of Hippocrates, that I shall not scruple to\r\nquote it entire.\r\n\r\n“La fièvre algide (dit M. Maillot) n’est pas généralement, comme\r\non le dit, la prolongation indéfinie du stade de froid; je l’ai vue\r\nrarement débuter de la sorte. Il y a même entre ces deux états une\r\ncontraste frappante. Dans le premier stade des fièvres intermittentes,\r\nla sensation du froid est hors de toute proportion avec l’abaissement\r\nréel de la température de la peau, tandis que, dans la fièvre algide,\r\nle froid n’est pas perçu par le malade, alors que la peau est\r\nglacée. C’est ordinairement pendant la réaction que commencent les\r\nsymptômes qui la caractérisent; souvent ils surviennent tout à coup\r\nau milieu d’une réaction qui paraissait franche. Au trouble de la\r\ncirculation succède en peu d’instants et presque sans transition le\r\nralentissement du pouls, qui devient bientôt très rare, fuit sous le\r\ndoigt et disparaît; l’abaissement de la température du corps va vite\r\net suit la progression promptement décroissante de la circulation;\r\nles extrémitiés, la face, le torse, se refroidissent successivement;\r\nl’abdomen seul conserve encore quelque temps un peu de chaleur;\r\nle contact de la peau donne la sensation de froid que procure le\r\nmarbre. Les lèvres sont décolorées, l’haleine froide, la voix cassée,\r\nles battemens du cœur rares, incomplets, appréciables seulement\r\npar l’auscultation; les facultés intellectuelles sont intactes, et\r\nle malade se complaît dans cet état de repos, surtout lorsqu’il\r\nsuccède à une fièvre violente, la physionomie est sans mobilité,\r\nl’impassibilité la plus grande est peinte sur son visage; ses traits\r\nsont morts. La marche de cette fièvre est très insidieuse; il n’est\r\npeut-être personne, dont elle n’ait surpris la vigilance, avant\r\nd’être familiarisé avec l’observation des accidens de cette nature,\r\non prend souvent pour une très grande amélioration due aux déplétions\r\nsanguines, le calme qui succède aux accidents inflammatoires; et plus\r\nd’une fois, dans de semblables circonstances, on n’a été détrompé que\r\npar la mort soudaine du malade. Toutes les fois qu’à une réaction\r\nplus on moins forte, on verra succéder tout à coup un ralentissement\r\ndu pouls, avec pâleur de la langue et décoloration des lèvres, on ne\r\ndevra hésiter à diagnostiquer une fièvre algide. La temporisation ici\r\ndonne la mort, en quelques heures. Dans quelques cas très rares, j’ai\r\ncependant vu cet état algide se prolonger trois ou quatre jours. Le\r\nmalade expire en conservant toutes ses facultés intellectuelles,[606]\r\nil s’éteint comme par un arrêt de l’innervation. Lorsque la mort n’est\r\npas le terme de cet état morbide si grave, le pouls se relève; la peau\r\nreprend sa chaleur naturelle; quelquefois alors la réaction détermine\r\nune irritation de l’encéphale ou des voies digestives; mais rarement\r\nelle est assez intense pour qu’on soit obligé de la combattre par des\r\ndéplétions sanguines.”[607] I shall add a remark, which M. Littré\r\ngives on the same authority: “J’ai tenu à mentionner ici l’impression\r\nqu’éprouva M. Maillot au début de sa pratique en Algérie, et qui est si\r\ninstructive; car, aller subitement de France exercer la médecine dans\r\nun pays chaud, ou lire les observations d’Hippocrate, c’est tout un:\r\nl’impression est la même, le changement de scène est aussi grand.”[608]\r\n\r\nI cannot help remarking in this place, however, that it appears to\r\nme singular, that M. Littré should represent the febris algida as\r\nbeing confined to southern climates, and should speak of it as being\r\nunknown in Paris; for, at all events, there seems to be no doubt\r\nthat it prevails in a more northerly region, namely, in Holland. It\r\nis thus described by the celebrated Franciscus de le Boe (_or_\r\nSylvius), who was professor of practical medicine at Leyden about the\r\nmiddle of the 17th century: “Febres algidæ observantur nonnunquam,\r\nnon tantum frigore præsertim, sed frigore tantum molestæ: adeo ut\r\naliquando et frequentius levis, aliquando et rarius nullus sequatur\r\ncalor. Tales, etiam semper algidas in Nosocomio academico habuimus\r\nita manifestas, ut non tantum incipiente, atque augescente, sed etiam\r\nvigente et déclinante, imò cessante paroxysmo, id est, semper tum suo,\r\ntum adstantium, tum medicorum sensu moleste ubique frigerent, nunquam\r\nteperent, minus calerent ullibi ægri. Suntque hæ algidæ graviores\r\nsemper forsan quotidianæ.”[609] The febris algida is also named “rigor\r\nwithout heat,” by the Greek authorities, and “frigus quod non calefit”\r\nby the Arabians, who, like Sylvius, as quoted above, regard it as a\r\nvariety of the quotidian intermittent. See PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nBook II., 26.\r\n\r\nM. Littré[610] quotes the remark of an excellent English authority\r\non fever, J. Johnson,[611] that it is singular the effects of marsh\r\neffluvia should have escaped the observation of Hippocrates, more\r\nespecially as the remittent and intermittent fevers, of which he\r\ntreats so fully, are mostly derived from this source. Now I must\r\nsay, that I am not aware of there being any passages in the works of\r\nHippocrates where the effects of marsh effluvia in engendering such\r\nfevers are distinctly noticed; but if Hippocrates was ignorant of this\r\nfact, in the etiology of fevers, it was well known to Galen, as may\r\nbe seen on reference to his very interesting work “On the Difference\r\nof Fevers.”[612] The Arabians also were familiar with the fact. See\r\nAvicenna, iv., 1, 2, 1.\r\n\r\nIn the treatise “On Airs,” which, although not admitted by us into the\r\nlist of genuine works, has considerable pretension to be so regarded,\r\nthe causes of fever are treated of with great precision, and there the\r\npestilential fevers are said to derive their origin from miasma, but\r\nwhether or not under this term be included marsh effluvia, cannot be\r\ndetermined. But perhaps a better reason might be assigned for there\r\nbeing little or no allusion to malaria in the works of Hippocrates,\r\nnamely, that after all, this was _not_ the cause of the epidemical\r\ndiseases which he describes. The following extract from a work of very\r\nhigh authority on fever is well deserving of consideration in this\r\nplace: “A question has arisen as to whether or not the inflammatory\r\nstates of fever, in warm countries, are caused by malaria, or by the\r\nother causes now instanced (excess of heat, etc.). There can be no\r\ndoubt that malaria very frequently produces in the plethoric, young,\r\nand robust, who have recently arrived in a hot climate, fever of an\r\ninflammatory and continued kind; but it must also be conceded that this\r\nfever chiefly occurs, even in persons thus constituted, during the dry\r\nseason, and at times and in places where the existence of malaria is\r\ndoubtful, or, at least, by no means proved. It is notoriously admitted\r\nthat the inflammatory states of continued fever, in both the East and\r\nWest Indies, appear among those soldiers, sailors, and civilians, who\r\nhave not been long in a warm country, and who have not suffered from\r\ndisease since their arrival; and that they take place chiefly during\r\nthe dry and warm seasons, and in situations where the usual affects of\r\nmalaria are never observed. This is the result of the experience of\r\nJackson, Annesley, Boyle, Twining, Conwell, and the other experienced\r\npractitioners in warm countries. It agrees with my own observations,\r\nand is even admitted by Dr. Fergusson, who has gone much further\r\nthan any one else in assigning malaria as the cause of intertropical\r\nfevers.”[613] I may mention, moreover, that Hippocrates and his\r\ncontemporaries were evidently not ignorant of the fact, that the\r\natmosphere in the vicinity of marshes and large rivers is unwholesome\r\nto the inhabitants of warm climates. See De Diæta, ii, 2.\r\n\r\nThe following are part of the conclusions which M. Littré draws\r\nfrom his investigations into the nature of the fevers described by\r\nHippocrates. I quote them as being strongly confirmatory of the\r\nopinions delivered by me in the Commentary on the Second Book of\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA.\r\n\r\n“Les fièvres décrites dans les _Epidémies_ d’Hippocrate différent\r\nde nos fièvres continués.\r\n\r\n“Les fièvres décrites dans les _Epidémies_ ont, dans leur\r\napparence générale, une similitude très grande avec celles des pays\r\nchauds.\r\n\r\n“La similitude n’est pas moins grande dans les détails que dans\r\nl’ensemble.\r\n\r\n“Dans les unes comme dans les autres les hypochondres sont pour un\r\ntiers des cas, le siége d’une manifestation toute spéciale.\r\n\r\n“Dans les unes comme dans les autres, il y a une forte tendence ou\r\nréfroidissement du corps, à la sueur froide et à la lividité des\r\nextrémités.”\r\n\r\nOn almost all the other diseases treated of in these books, M. Littré’s\r\nopinions, in like manner, exactly coincide with those delivered by\r\nme in the above-mentioned work. Thus he arrives at the conclusion,\r\nthat the Phrenitis and Lethargus of Hippocrates were varieties of the\r\nCausus. Compare PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book III., 6, 9. He refers\r\nthem to _les fièvres pernicieuses comateuses pseudo-continués et les\r\nfièvres pernicieuses dolorantes pseudo-continués_ of M. Maillot.\r\nIt would appear from the extracts which he quotes from a work of M.\r\nRoux, on the Diseases of Morea, that a similar tendency to pass into\r\nphrenitis and lethargy is still observable in the land of Greece. The\r\nfevers of the East Indies also, as described by Dr. Twining,[614]\r\nappear to partake very much of the same character. In a word, the\r\nconclusions to which a patient study of modern authorities on the\r\nsubject have brought me amount to this; that the fevers described by\r\nHippocrates in his “Epidemics,” are exactly the same as those which\r\nare now described as still prevailing in the land of Greece: that they\r\ncorrespond very well with those described by Cleghorn as occurring in\r\nMajorca; differ but little from those described by Pringle, Monro,\r\nand Sylvius, as happening in the Low Countries, and differ from those\r\ndescribed by Twining, as happening in Bengal, only in a few particulars.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis of their contents given above it will readily be\r\nunderstood that the subject-matters of these two books are not arranged\r\nmethodically. Indeed it is quite obvious from the nature of the work\r\nthat the matters which are treated of in it had never been methodized\r\nby the author. Certainly then, as proposed by Desmair,[615] it would\r\nbe a much more natural arrangement to give the four Constitutions of\r\nthe season first, and then to give the forty-two cases together. But\r\nthe present arrangement being of old standing, no editor has thought\r\nhimself warranted to depart from it.\r\n\r\nThere are two important professional subjects of which it may appear\r\nsurprising that there is no mention in the “Books of the Epidemics,”\r\nI mean sphygmology and contagion. Galen repeatedly declares it as his\r\nopinion, that Hippocrates paid no attention to the characters of the\r\narterial pulse, and that the subject was not at all studied until\r\nafter his time; and as far as I can see there is no ground for calling\r\nin question this opinion of Galen. Herophilus, in fact, would appear\r\nto have been the first person that made any progress in this study.\r\nIt is more remarkable that Hippocrates should omit all allusion to\r\nthe other subject, more especially as the contagiousness of certain\r\ndiseases would appear to have been the popular belief of his age. Thus\r\nhis contemporary, Thucydides, in describing the plague, expresses\r\nhimself in such terms as puts it beyond a doubt that he regarded the\r\ndisease as being of a contagious nature. And another contemporary,\r\nIsocrates, makes such observations on a certain case of empyema, by\r\nwhich he evidently means phthisis pulmonalis, as to show that it also\r\nwas regarded as being communicable.[616] How the omission is to be\r\naccounted for I do not know, but certain it is that not the least\r\nreference to contagion, in any shape, is to be found in any of the\r\nHippocratic treatises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BOOK I.--OF THE EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SEC. I.--CONSTITUTION FIRST.\r\n\r\n1. In Thasus,[617] about the autumnal equinox, and under the\r\nPleiades,[618] the rains were abundant, constant, and soft, with\r\nsoutherly winds; the winter southerly, the northerly winds faint,\r\ndroughts; on the whole, the winter having the character of spring. The\r\nspring was southerly, cool, rains small in quantity. Summer, for the\r\nmost part, cloudy, no rain, the Etesian winds, rare and small, blew in\r\nan irregular manner. The whole constitution of the season being thus\r\ninclined to the southerly, and with droughts early in the spring, from\r\nthe preceding opposite and northerly state, ardent fevers occurred\r\nin a few instances, and these very mild, being rarely attended with\r\nhemorrhage, and never proving fatal.[619] Swellings appeared about\r\nthe ears, in many on either side, and in the greatest number on both\r\nsides, being unaccompanied by fever so as not to confine the patient\r\nto bed; in all cases they disappeared without giving trouble, neither\r\ndid any of them come to suppuration, as is common in swellings from\r\nother causes. They were of a lax, large, diffused character, without\r\ninflammation or pain, and they went away without any critical sign.\r\nThey seized children, adults, and mostly those who were engaged in\r\nthe exercises of the palestra and gymnasium, but seldom attacked\r\nwomen. Many had dry coughs without expectoration, and accompanied\r\nwith hoarseness of voice. In some instances earlier, and in others\r\nlater, inflammations with pain seized sometimes one of the testicles,\r\nand sometimes both;[620] some of these cases were accompanied with\r\nfever and some not; the greater part of these were attended with much\r\nsuffering. In other respects they were free of disease, so as not to\r\nrequire medical assistance.[621]\r\n\r\n2. Early in the beginning of spring, and through the summer, and\r\ntowards winter, many of those who had been long gradually declining,\r\ntook to bed with symptoms of phthisis; in many cases formerly of a\r\ndoubtful character the disease then became confirmed; in these the\r\nconstitution inclined to the phthisical.[622] Many, and, in fact,\r\nthe most of them, died; and of those confined to bed, I do not know\r\nif a single individual survived for any considerable time; they died\r\nmore suddenly than is common in such cases. But other diseases, of a\r\nprotracted character, and attended with fever, were well supported, and\r\ndid not prove fatal: of these we will give a description afterwards.\r\nConsumption was the most considerable of the diseases which then\r\nprevailed, and the only one which proved fatal to many persons. Most\r\nof them were affected by these diseases in the following manner:\r\nfevers accompanied with rigors, of the continual type, acute, having\r\nno complete intermissions, but of the form of the semitertians,\r\nbeing milder the one day, and the next having an exacerbation, and\r\nincreasing in violence; constant sweats, but not diffused over the\r\nwhole body; extremities very cold, and warmed with difficulty; bowels\r\ndisordered, with bilious, scanty, unmixed, thin, pungent, and frequent\r\ndejections. The urine was thin, colourless, unconcocted, or thick, with\r\na deficient sediment, not settling favorably, but casting down a crude\r\nand unseasonable sediment. Sputa small, dense, concocted, but brought\r\nup rarely and with difficulty; and in those who encountered the most\r\nviolent symptoms there was no concoction at all, but they continued\r\nthroughout spitting crude matters. Their fauces, in most of them,\r\nwere painful from first to last, having redness with inflammation;\r\ndefluxions thin, small and acrid; they were soon wasted and became\r\nworse, having no appetite for any kind of food throughout; no thirst;\r\nmost persons delirious when near death. So much concerning the\r\nphthisical affections.[623]\r\n\r\n3. In the course of the summer and autumn many fevers of the continual\r\ntype, but not violent;[624] they attacked persons who had been long\r\nindisposed, but who were otherwise not in an uncomfortable state.\r\nIn most cases the bowels were disordered in a very moderate degree,\r\nand they did not suffer thereby in any manner worth mentioning; the\r\nurine was generally well coloured, clear, thin, and after a time\r\nbecoming concocted near the crisis. They had not much cough, nor was it\r\ntroublesome; they were not deficient in appetite, for it was necessary\r\nto give them food, (on the whole, persons labouring under phthisis were\r\nnot affected in the usual manner).[625] They were affected with fevers,\r\nrigors, and deficient sweats, with varied and irregular paroxysms, in\r\ngeneral not intermitting, but having exacerbations in the tertian form.\r\nThe earliest crisis which occurred was about the twentieth day, in most\r\nabout the fortieth, and in many about the eightieth. But there were\r\ncases in which it did not leave them thus at all, but in an irregular\r\nmanner, and without any crisis; in most of these the fevers, after a\r\nbrief interval, relapsed again; and from these relapses they came to a\r\ncrisis in the same periods; but in many they were prolonged so that the\r\ndisease was not gone at the approach of winter. Of all those which are\r\ndescribed under this constitution, the phthisical diseases alone were\r\nof a fatal character; for in all the others the patients bore up well,\r\nand did not die of the other fevers.[626]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SEC. II.--CONSTITUTION SECOND.\r\n\r\n1. In Thasus, early in autumn, the winter suddenly set in rainy\r\nbefore the usual time, with much northerly and southerly winds. These\r\nthings all continued so during the season of the Pleiades, and until\r\ntheir setting.[627] The winter was northerly, the rains frequent, in\r\ntorrents, and large, with snow, but with a frequent mixture of fair\r\nweather. These things were all so, but the setting in of the cold\r\nwas not much out of season. After the winter solstice, and at the\r\ntime when the zephyr usually begins to blow, severe winterly storms\r\nout of season, with much northerly wind, snow, continued and copious\r\nrains; the sky tempestuous and clouded; these things were protracted,\r\nand did not remit until the equinox. The spring was cold, northerly,\r\nrainy, and clouded; the summer was not very sultry, the Etesian winds\r\nblew constant, but quickly afterwards, about the rising of Arcturus,\r\nthere were again many rains with north winds. The whole season being\r\nwet, cold, and northerly, people were, for the most part, healthy\r\nduring winter; but early in the spring very many, indeed, the greater\r\npart, were valetudinary. At first ophthalmies set in, with rheums,\r\npains, unconcocted discharges, small concretions, generally breaking\r\nwith difficulty, in most instances they relapsed, and they did not\r\ncease until late in autumn.[628] During summer and autumn there were\r\ndysenteric affections, attacks of tenesmus and lientery, bilious\r\ndiarrhœa, with thin, copious, undigested, and acrid dejections, and\r\nsometimes with watery stools; many had copious defluxions, with pain,\r\nof a bilious, watery, slimy, purulent nature, attended with strangury,\r\nnot connected with disease of the kidneys, but one complaint succeeding\r\nthe other; vomitings of bile, phlegm, and undigested food, sweats, in\r\nall cases a redundance of humors. In many instances these complaints\r\nwere unattended with fever, and did not prevent the patients from\r\nwalking about, but some cases were febrile, as will be described. In\r\nsome all those described below occurred with pain. During autumn,\r\nand at the commencement of winter, there were phthisical complaints,\r\ncontinual fevers; and, in a few cases, ardent; some diurnal, others\r\nnocturnal, semitertians, true tertians, quartans, irregular fevers.\r\nAll the fevers which are described attacked great numbers. The ardent\r\nfevers attacked the smallest numbers, and the patients suffered the\r\nleast from them, for there were no hemorrhages, except a few and to a\r\nsmall amount, nor was there delirium; all the other complaints were\r\nslight; in these the crises were regular, in most instances, with the\r\nintermittents, in seventeen days; and I know no instance of a person\r\ndying of causus, nor becoming phrenitic.[629] The tertians were more\r\nnumerous than the ardent fevers, and attended with more pain;[630]\r\nbut these all had four periods in regular succession from the first\r\nattack, and they had a complete crisis in seven, without a relapse\r\nin any instance. The quartans attacked many at first, in the form of\r\nregular quartans, but in no few cases a transition from other fevers\r\nand diseases into quartans took place; they were protracted, as is\r\nwont with them, indeed, more so than usual. Quotidian, nocturnal, and\r\nwandering fevers attacked many persons, some of whom continued to keep\r\nup, and others were confined to bed. In most instances these fevers\r\nwere prolonged under the Pleiades and till winter. Many persons, and\r\nmore especially children, had convulsions from the commencement;[631]\r\nand they had fever, and the convulsions supervened upon the fevers;\r\nin most cases they were protracted, but free from danger, unless in\r\nthose who were in a deadly state from other complaints. Those fevers\r\nwhich were continual in the main, and with no intermissions, but having\r\nexacerbations in the tertian form,[632] there being remissions the one\r\nday and exacerbations the next, were the most violent of all those\r\nwhich occurred at that time, and the most protracted, and occurring\r\nwith the greatest pains, beginning mildly, always on the whole\r\nincreasing, and being exacerbated, and always turning worse, having\r\nsmall remissions, and after an abatement having more violent paroxysms,\r\nand growing worse, for the most part, on the critical days. Rigors, in\r\nall cases, took place in an irregular and uncertain manner, very rare\r\nand weak in them, but greater in all other fevers; frequent sweats, but\r\nmost seldom in them, bringing no alleviation, but, on the contrary,\r\ndoing mischief. Much cold of the extremities in them, and these were\r\nwarmed with difficulty. Insomnolency, for the most part, especially\r\nin these fevers, and again a disposition to coma. The bowels, in all\r\ndiseases, were disordered, and in a bad state, but worst of all in\r\nthese. The urine, in most of them, was either thin and crude, yellow,\r\nand after a time with slight symptoms of concoction in a critical form,\r\nor having the proper thickness, but muddy, and neither settling nor\r\nsubsiding; or having small and bad, and crude sediments; these being\r\nthe worst of all. Coughs attended these fevers, but I cannot state that\r\nany harm or good ever resulted from the cough. The most of these were\r\nprotracted and troublesome, went on in a very disorderly and irregular\r\nform, and, for the most part, did not end in a crisis, either in the\r\nfatal cases or in the others; for if it left some of them for a season\r\nit soon returned again. In a few instances the fever terminated with\r\na crisis; in the earliest of these about the eightieth day, and some\r\nof these relapsed, so that most of them were not free from the fever\r\nduring the winter; but the fever left most of them without a crisis,\r\nand these things happened alike to those who recovered and to those\r\nwho did not. There being much want of crisis and much variety as to\r\nthese diseases, the greatest and worst symptom attended the most of\r\nthem, namely, a loathing of all articles of food, more especially with\r\nthose who had otherwise fatal symptoms; but they were not unseasonably\r\nthirsty in such fevers. After a length of time, with much suffering and\r\ngreat wasting, abscesses were formed in these cases, either unusually\r\nlarge, so that the patients could not support them, or unusually small,\r\nso that they did no good, but soon relapsed and speedily got worse. The\r\ndiseases which attacked them were in the form of dysenteries, tenesmus,\r\nlientery, and fluxes; but, in some cases, there were dropsies, with or\r\nwithout these complaints. Whatever attacked them violently speedily\r\ncut them off, or again, did them no good. Small rashes, and not\r\ncorresponding to the violence of the disease, and quickly disappearing,\r\nor swellings occurred about the ears, which were not resolved, and\r\nbrought on no crisis.[633] In some they were determined to the joints,\r\nand especially to the hip-joint, terminating critically with a few,\r\nand quickly again increasing to its original habit. Persons died of\r\nall these diseases, but mostly of these fevers, and especially infants\r\njust weaned, and older children, until eight or ten years of age, and\r\nthose before puberty. These things occurred to those affected with the\r\ncomplaints described above, and to many persons at first without them.\r\nThe only favorable symptom, and the greatest of those which occurred,\r\nand what saved most of those who were in the greatest dangers, was\r\nthe conversion of it to a strangury, and when, in addition to this,\r\nabscesses were formed.[634] The strangury attacked, most especially,\r\npersons of the ages I have mentioned, but it also occurred in many\r\nothers, both of those who were not confined to bed and those who\r\nwere. There was a speedy and great change in all these cases. For the\r\nbowels, if they happened previously to have watery discharges of a\r\nbad character, became regular, they got an appetite for food, and the\r\nfevers were mild afterwards. But, with regard to the strangury itself,\r\nthe symptoms were protracted and painful. Their urine was copious,\r\nthick, of various characters, red, mixed with pus, and was passed with\r\npain. These all recovered, and I did not see a single instance of death\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n5.[635] With regard to the dangers of these cases, one must always\r\nattend to the seasonable concoction of all the evacuations, and to the\r\nfavorable and critical abscesses. The concoctions indicate a speedy\r\ncrisis and recovery of health; crude and undigested evacuations, and\r\nthose which are converted into bad abscesses, indicate either want\r\nof crisis, or pains, or prolongation of the disease, or death, or\r\nrelapses; which of these it is to be must be determined from other\r\ncircumstances. _The physician must be able to tell the antecedents,\r\nknow the present, and foretell the future--must meditate these things,\r\nand have two special objects in view with regard to diseases, namely,\r\nto do good or to do no harm. The art consists in three things--the\r\ndisease, the patient, and the physician. The physician is the servant\r\nof the art, and the patient must combat the disease along with the\r\nphysician._[636]\r\n\r\n6. Pains about the head and neck, and heaviness of the same along\r\nwith pain, occur either without fevers or in fevers. Convulsions\r\noccurring in persons attacked with frenzy, and having vomitings of\r\nverdigris-green bile, in some cases quickly prove fatal. In ardent\r\nfevers, and in those other fevers in which there is pain of the neck,\r\nheaviness of the temples, mistiness about the eyes, and distention\r\nabout the hypochondriac region, not unattended with pain, hemorrhage\r\nfrom the nose takes place,[637] but those who have heaviness of the\r\nwhole head, cardialgia and nausea, vomit bilious and pituitous matters;\r\nchildren, in such affections, are generally attacked with convulsions,\r\nand women have these and also pains of the uterus; whereas, in elder\r\npersons, and those in whom the heat is already more subdued, these\r\ncases end in paralysis, mania, and loss of sight.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THIRD CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n7. In Thasus, a little before and during the season of Arcturus,[638]\r\nthere were frequent and great rains, with northerly winds. About\r\nthe equinox, and till the setting of the Pleiades, there were a few\r\nsoutherly rains: the winter northerly and parched, cold, with great\r\nwinds and snow. Great storms about the equinox, the spring northerly,\r\ndryness, rains few and cold. About the summer solstice, scanty rains,\r\nand great cold until near the season of the Dog-star.[639] After the\r\nDog-days, until the season of Arcturus, the summer hot, great droughts,\r\nnot in intervals, but continued and severe: no rain; the Etesian winds\r\nblew; about the season of Arcturus southerly rains until the equinox.\r\n\r\n8. In this state of things, during winter, paraplegia set in, and\r\nattacked many, and some died speedily; and otherwise the disease\r\nprevailed much in an epidemical form, but persons remained free from\r\nall other diseases.[640] Early in the spring, ardent fevers commenced\r\nand continued through the summer until the equinox. Those then that\r\nwere attacked immediately after the commencement of the spring and\r\nsummer, for the most part recovered, and but few of them died. But when\r\nthe autumn and the rains had set in, they were of a fatal character,\r\nand the greater part then died.[641] When in these attacks of ardent\r\nfevers there was a proper and copious hemorrhage from the nose, they\r\nwere generally saved by it, and I do not know a single person who\r\nhad a proper hemorrhage who died in this constitution. Philiscus,\r\nEpaminon, and Silenus, indeed, who had a trifling epistaxis on the\r\nfourth and fifth day, died.[642] The most of those seized with the\r\ndisease had a rigor about the time of the crisis, and especially those\r\nwho had no hemorrhage; these had also the rigor associated. Some were\r\nattacked with jaundice on the sixth day,[643] but these were benefited\r\neither by an urinary purgation, or a disorder of the bowels, or a\r\ncopious hemorrhage, as in the case of Heraclides, who was lodged with\r\nAristocydes: this person, though he had the hemorrhage from the nose,\r\nthe purgation by the bladder, and disorder of the bowels, experienced\r\na favorable crisis on the twentieth day, not like the servant of\r\nPhanagoras, who had none of these symptoms, and died. The hemorrhages\r\nattacked most persons, but especially young persons and those in the\r\nprime of life, and the greater part of those who had not the hemorrhage\r\ndied:[644] elderly persons had jaundice or disorder of the bowels,\r\nsuch as Bion, who was lodged with Silenus. Dysenteries were epidemical\r\nduring the summer, and some of those cases in which the hemorrhage\r\noccurred, terminated in dysentery, as happened to the slave of Eraton,\r\nand to Mullus, who had a copious hemorrhage, which settled down into\r\ndysentery, and they recovered. This humor was redundant in many cases,\r\nsince in those who had not the hemorrhage about the crisis, but the\r\nrisings about the ears disappeared, after their disappearance there was\r\na sense of weight in the left flank extending to the extremity of the\r\nhip, and pain setting in after the crisis, with a discharge of thin\r\nurine; they began to have small hemorrhages about the twenty-fourth\r\nday, and the swelling was converted into the hemorrhage. In the case of\r\nAntiphon, the son of Critobulus, the fever ceased and came to a crisis\r\nabout the fortieth day. Many women were attacked, but fewer than of\r\nthe men, and there were fewer deaths among them. But most of them had\r\ndifficult parturition, and after labor they were taken ill, and these\r\nmost especially died, as, for example, the daughter of Telebolus died\r\non the sixth day after delivery.[645] Most females had the menstrual\r\ndischarge during the fever, and many girls had it then for the first\r\ntime: in certain individuals both the hemorrhage from the nose and the\r\nmenses appeared; thus, in the case of the virgin daughter of Dætharses,\r\nthe menses then took place for the first time, and she had also a\r\ncopious hemorrhage from the nose, and I knew no instance of any one\r\ndying when one or other of these took place properly. But all those\r\nin the pregnant state that were attacked had abortions, as far as I\r\nobserved. The urine in most cases was of the proper color, but thin,\r\nand having scanty sediments:[646] in most the bowels were disordered\r\nwith thin and bilious dejections; and many, after passing through the\r\nother crises, terminated in dysenteries, as happened to Xenophanes\r\nand Critias. The urine was watery, copious, clear, and thin; and even\r\nafter the crises, when the sediment was natural, and all the other\r\ncritical symptoms were favorable, as I recollect having happened to\r\nBion, who was lodged in the house of Silenus, and Critias, who lived\r\nwith Xenophanes, the slave of Areton, and the wife of Mnesistratus. But\r\nafterwards all these were attacked with dysentery. It would be worth\r\nwhile to inquire whether the watery urine was the cause of this.[647]\r\nAbout the season of Arcturus many had the crisis on the eleventh day,\r\nand in them the regular relapses did not take place, but they became\r\ncomatose about this time, especially children; but there were fewest\r\ndeaths of all among them.\r\n\r\n9. About the equinox, and until the season of the Pleiades, and at\r\nthe approach of winter, many ardent fevers set in; but great numbers at\r\nthat season were seized with phrenitis, and many died;[648] a few cases\r\nalso occurred during the summer. These then made their attack at the\r\ncommencement of ardent fevers, which were attended with fatal symptoms;\r\nfor immediately upon their setting in, there were acute fever and\r\nsmall rigors, insomnolency, aberration, thirst, nausea, insignificant\r\nsweats about the forehead and clavicles, but no general perspiration;\r\nthey had much delirious talking, fears, despondency, great coldness of\r\nthe extremities, in the feet, but more especially in their hands: the\r\nparoxysms were on the even days; and in most cases, on the fourth day,\r\nthe most violent pains set in, with sweats, generally coldish, and the\r\nextremities could not be warmed, but were livid and rather cold, and\r\nthey had then no thirst; in them the urine was black, scanty, thin,\r\nand the bowels were constipated; there was an hemorrhage from the nose\r\nin no case in which these symptoms occurred, but merely a trifling\r\nepistaxis; and none of them had a relapse, but they died on the sixth\r\nday with sweats.[649] In the phrenitic cases, all the symptoms which\r\nhave been described did not occur, but in them the disease mostly came\r\nto a crisis on the eleventh day, and in some on the twentieth. In those\r\ncases in which the phrenitis did not begin immediately, but about the\r\nthird or fourth day, the disease was moderate at the commencement,\r\nbut assumed a violent character about the seventh day. There was a\r\ngreat number of diseases, and of those affected, they who died were\r\nprincipally infants, young persons, adults having smooth bodies, white\r\nskins, straight and black hair, dark eyes, those living recklessly and\r\nluxuriously; persons with shrill, or rough voices, who stammered and\r\nwere passionate, and women more especially died from this form. In\r\nthis constitution, four symptoms in particular proved salutary; either\r\na hemorrhage from the nose, or a copious discharge by the bladder of\r\nurine, having an abundant and proper sediment, or a bilious disorder\r\nof the bowels at the proper time, or an attack of dysentery.[650] And\r\nin many cases it happened, that the crisis did not take place by any\r\none of the symptoms which have been mentioned, but the patient passed\r\nthrough most of them, and appeared to be in an uncomfortable way,\r\nand yet all who were attacked with these symptoms recovered. All the\r\nsymptoms which I have described occurred also to women and girls; and\r\nwhoever of them had any of these symptoms in a favorable manner, or\r\nthe menses appeared abundantly, were saved thereby, and had a crisis,\r\nso that I do not know a single female who had any of these favorably\r\nthat died. But the daughter of Philo, who had a copious hemorrhage from\r\nthe nose, and took supper unseasonably on the seventh day, died. In\r\nthose cases of acute, and more especially of ardent fevers, in which\r\nthere is an involuntary discharge of tears, you may expect a hemorrhage\r\nfrom the nose, unless the other symptoms be of a fatal character, for\r\nin those of a bad description, they do not indicate a hemorrhage, but\r\ndeath. Swellings about the ears, with pain in fevers, sometimes when\r\nthe fever went off critically, neither subsided nor were converted into\r\npus; in these cases a bilious diarrhœa, or dysentery, or thick urine\r\nhaving a sediment, carried off the disease, as happened to Hermippus\r\nof Clazomenæ. The circumstances relating to crises, as far as we can\r\nrecognize them, were so far similar and so far dissimilar. Thus two\r\nbrothers became ill at the same hour (they were brothers of Epigenes,\r\nand lodged near the theatre), of these the elder had a crisis on the\r\nsixth day, and the younger on the seventh, and both had a relapse at\r\nthe same hour; it then left them for five days, and from the return\r\nof the fever both had a crisis together on the seventeenth day. Most\r\nhad a crisis on the sixth day; it then left them for six days, and\r\nfrom the relapse there was a crisis on the fifth day.[651] But those\r\nwho had a crisis on the seventh day, had an intermission for seven\r\ndays; and the crisis took place on the third day after the relapse.\r\nThose who had a crisis on the sixth day, after an interval of six\r\ndays were seized again on the third, and having left them for one\r\nday, the fever attacked them again on the next and came to a crisis,\r\nas happened to Evagon the son of Dætharses. Those in whom the crisis\r\nhappened on the sixth day, had an intermission of seven days, and\r\nfrom the relapse there was a crisis on the fourth, as happened to\r\nthe daughter of Aglaïdas. The greater part of those who were taken\r\nill under this constitution of things, were affected in this manner,\r\nand I did not know a single case of recovery, in which there was not\r\na relapse agreeably to the stated order of relapses; and all those\r\nrecovered in which the relapses took place according to this form:\r\nnor did I know a single instance of those who then passed through the\r\ndisease in this manner who had another relapse. In these diseases\r\ndeath generally happened on the sixth day, as happened to Epaminondas,\r\nSilenus, and Philiscus the son of Antagoras. Those who had parotid\r\nswellings experienced a crisis on the twentieth day, but in all these\r\ncases the disease went off without coming to a suppuration, and was\r\nturned upon the bladder. But in Cratistonax, who lived by the temple\r\nof Hercules, and in the maid servant of Scymnus the fuller, it turned\r\nto a suppuration, and they died. Those who had a crisis on the seventh\r\nday, had an intermission of nine days, and a relapse which came to a\r\ncrisis on the fourth day from the return of the fever, as was the case\r\nwith Pantacles, who resided close by the temple of Bacchus. Those who\r\nhad a crisis on the seventh day, after an interval of six days had a\r\nrelapse, from which they had a crisis on the seventh day, as happened\r\nto Phanocritus, who was lodged with Gnathon the painter. During the\r\nwinter, about the winter solstices, and until the equinox, the ardent\r\nfevers and frenzies prevailed, and many died. The crisis, however,\r\nchanged, and happened to the greater number on the fifth day from the\r\ncommencement, left them for four days and relapsed; and after the\r\nreturn, there was a crisis on the fifth day, making in all fourteen\r\ndays. The crisis took place thus in the case of most children, also in\r\nelder persons. Some had a crisis on the eleventh day, a relapse on the\r\nfourteenth, a complete crisis on the twentieth; but certain persons,\r\nwho had a rigor about the twentieth, had a crisis on the fortieth. The\r\ngreater part had a rigor along with the original crisis, and these had\r\nalso a rigor about the crisis in the relapse. There were fewest cases\r\nof rigor in the spring, more in summer, still more in autumn, but by\r\nfar the most in winter; then hemorrhages ceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SEC. III.\r\n\r\n10. With regard to diseases, the circumstances from which we form a\r\njudgment of them are,--by attending to the general nature of all, and\r\nthe peculiar nature of each individual,--to the disease, the patient,\r\nand the applications,--to the person who applies them, as that makes a\r\ndifference for better or for worse,--to the whole constitution of the\r\nseason, and particularly to the state of the heavens, and the nature\r\nof each country;--to the patient’s habits, regimen, and pursuits;--to\r\nhis conversation, manners, taciturnity, thoughts, sleep, or absence\r\nof sleep, and sometimes his dreams, what and when they occur;--to his\r\npicking and scratching;[652]--to his tears;--to the alvine discharges,\r\nurine, sputa, and vomitings; and to the changes of diseases from the\r\none into the other;--to the deposits, whether of a deadly or critical\r\ncharacter;--to the sweat, coldness, rigor, cough, sneezing, hiccup,\r\nrespiration, eructation, flatulence, whether passed silently or with\r\na noise;--to hemorrhages and hemorrhoids;--from these, and their\r\nconsequences, we must form our judgment.[653]\r\n\r\n11. Fevers are,--the continual, some of which hold during the day and\r\nhave a remission at night, and others hold during the night and have\r\na remission during the day;[654] semitertians, tertians, quartans,\r\nquintans, septans, nonans. The most acute, strongest, most dangerous,\r\nand fatal diseases, occur in the continual fever. The least dangerous\r\nof all, and the mildest and most protracted, is the quartan, for it\r\nis not only such from itself, but it also carries off other great\r\ndiseases.[655] In what is called the semitertian, other acute diseases\r\nare apt to occur, and it is the most fatal of all others, and moreover\r\nphthisical persons, and those laboring under other protracted diseases,\r\nare apt to be attacked by it.[656] The nocturnal fever is not very\r\nfatal, but protracted; the diurnal is still more protracted, and in\r\nsome cases passes into phthisis. The septan is protracted, but not\r\nfatal; the nonan more protracted, and not fatal. The true tertian comes\r\nquickly to a crisis, and is not fatal; but the quintan is the worst of\r\nall, for it proves fatal when it precedes an attack of phthisis, and\r\nwhen it supervenes on persons who are already consumptive.[657] There\r\nare peculiar modes, and constitutions, and paroxysms, in every one of\r\nthese fevers; for example,--the continual, in some cases at the very\r\ncommencement, grows, as it were, and attains its full strength, and\r\nrises to its most dangerous pitch, but is diminished about and at the\r\ncrisis; in others it begins gentle and suppressed, but gains ground and\r\nis exacerbated every day, and bursts forth with all its heat about and\r\nat the crisis; while in others, again, it commences mildly, increases,\r\nand is exacerbated until it reaches its acmé, and then remits until at\r\nand about the crisis.[658] These varieties occur in every fever, and in\r\nevery disease. From these observations one must regulate the regimen\r\naccordingly. There are many other important symptoms allied to these,\r\npart of which have been already noticed, and part will be described\r\nafterwards, from a consideration of which one may judge, and decide in\r\neach case, whether the disease be acute, and whether it will end in\r\ndeath or recovery; or whether it will be protracted, and will end in\r\ndeath or recovery; and in what cases food is to be given, and in what\r\nnot; and when and to what amount, and what particular kind of food is\r\nto be administered.\r\n\r\n12. Those diseases which have their paroxysms on even days have their\r\ncrises on even days; and those which have their paroxysms on uneven\r\ndays have their crises on uneven days. The first period of those which\r\nhave the crisis on even days, is the 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 14th, 20th,\r\n30th, 40th, 60th, 80th, 100th; and the first period of those which have\r\ntheir crises on uneven days, is the let, 3d, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 17th,\r\n21st, 27th, 31st. It should be known, that if the crisis take place on\r\nany other day than on those described, it indicates that there will\r\nbe a relapse, which may prove fatal. But one ought to pay attention,\r\nand know in these seasons what crises will lead to recovery and what\r\nto death, or to changes for the better or the worse. Irregular fevers,\r\nquartans, quintans, septans, and nonans should be studied, in order to\r\nfind out in what periods their crises take place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  13. FOURTEEN CASES OF DISEASE.[659]\r\n\r\nCASE I.--Philiscus, who lived by the Wall, took to bed on\r\nthe first day of acute fever; he sweated; towards night was uneasy. On\r\nthe second day all the symptoms were exacerbated; late in the evening\r\nhad a proper stool from a small clyster; the night quiet. On the third\r\nday, early in the morning and until noon, he appeared to be free from\r\nfever; towards evening, acute fever, with sweating, thirst, tongue\r\nparched; passed black urine; night uncomfortable, no sleep; he was\r\ndelirious on all subjects. On the fourth, all the symptoms exacerbated,\r\nurine black; night more comfortable, urine of a better color. On the\r\nfifth, about mid-day, had a slight trickling of pure blood from the\r\nnose; urine varied in character, having floating in it round bodies,\r\nresembling semen, and scattered, but which did not fall to the bottom;\r\na suppository having been applied, some scanty flatulent matters were\r\npassed; night uncomfortable, little sleep, talking incoherently;\r\nextremities altogether cold, and could not be warmed; urine black;\r\nslept a little towards day; loss of speech, cold sweats; extremities\r\nlivid; about the middle of the sixth day he died. The respiration\r\nthroughout, like that of a person recollecting himself, was rare, and\r\nlarge, and spleen was swelled upon in a round tumor, the sweats cold\r\nthroughout, the paroxysms on the even days.[660]\r\n\r\nCASE II.--Silenus lived on the Broad-way, near the house\r\nof Evalcidas. From fatigue, drinking, and unseasonable exercises, he\r\nwas seized with fever. He began with having pain in the loins; he had\r\nheaviness of the head, and there was stiffness of the neck. On the\r\nfirst day the alvine discharges were bilious, unmixed, frothy, high\r\ncolored, and copious; urine black, having a black sediment; he was\r\nthirsty, tongue dry; no sleep at night. On the second, acute fever,\r\nstools more copious, thinner, frothy; urine black, an uncomfortable\r\nnight, slight delirium. On the third, all the symptoms exacerbated;\r\nan oblong distention, of a softish nature, from both sides of the\r\nhypochondrium to the navel; stools thin, and darkish; urine muddy, and\r\ndarkish; no sleep at night; much talking, laughter, singing, he could\r\nnot restrain himself. On the fourth, in the same state. On the fifth,\r\nstools bilious, unmixed, smooth, greasy; urine thin, and transparent;\r\nslight absence of delirium. On the sixth, slight perspiration about\r\nthe head; extremities cold and livid; much tossing about; no passage\r\nfrom the bowels, urine suppressed, acute fever. On the seventh, loss\r\nof speech; extremities could no longer be kept warm; no discharge of\r\nurine. On the eighth, a cold sweat all over; red rashes with sweat, of\r\na round figure, small, like _vari_, persistent, not subsiding; by\r\nmeans of a slight stimulus, a copious discharge from the bowels, of\r\na thin and undigested character, with pain; urine acrid, and passed\r\nwith pain; extremities slightly heated; sleep slight, and comatose;\r\nspeechless; urine thin, and transparent. On the ninth, in the same\r\nstate. On the tenth, no drink taken; comatose, sleep slight; alvine\r\ndischarges the same; urine abundant, and thickish; when allowed to\r\nstand, the sediment farinaceous and white; extremities again cold.\r\nOn the eleventh, he died. At the commencement, and throughout, the\r\nrespiration was slow and large; there was a constant throbbing in the\r\nhypochondrium; his age was about twenty.[661]\r\n\r\nCASE III.--Herophon was seized with an acute fever; alvine discharges\r\nat first were scanty, and attended with tenesmus; but afterwards\r\nthey were passed of a thin, bilious character, and frequent; there\r\nwas no sleep; urine black, and thin. On the fifth, in the morning,\r\ndeafness; all the symptoms exacerbated; spleen swollen; distention\r\nof the hypochondrium; alvine discharges scanty, and black; he became\r\ndelirious. On the sixth, delirious; at night, sweating, coldness;\r\nthe delirium continued. On the seventh, he became cold, thirsty, was\r\ndisordered in mind; at night recovered his senses; slept. On the\r\neighth, was feverish; the spleen diminished in size; quite collected;\r\nhad pain at first about the groin, on the same side as the spleen;\r\nhad pains in both legs; night comfortable; urine better colored, had\r\na scanty sediment. On the ninth, sweated; the crisis took place;\r\nfever remitted. On the fifth day afterwards, fever relapsed, spleen\r\nimmediately became swollen; acute fever; deafness again. On the third\r\nday after the relapse, the spleen diminished; deafness less; legs\r\npainful; sweated during the night; crisis took place on the seventeenth\r\nday; had no disorder of the senses during the relapse.[662]\r\n\r\nCASE IV.--In Thasus, the wife of Philinus, having been delivered of a\r\ndaughter, the lochial discharge being natural, and other matters going\r\non mildly, on the fourteenth day after delivery was seized with fever,\r\nattended with rigor; was pained at first in the cardiac region of the\r\nstomach and right hypochondrium; pain in the genital organs; lochial\r\ndischarge ceased. Upon the application of a pessary all these symptoms\r\nwere alleviated; pains of the head, neck, and loins remained; no sleep;\r\nextremities cold; thirst; bowels in a hot state; stools scanty; urine\r\nthin, and colorless at first. On the sixth, towards night, senses much\r\ndisordered, but again were restored. On the seventh, thirsty; the\r\nevacuations bilious, and high colored. On the eighth, had a rigor;\r\nacute fever; much spasm, with pain; talked much, incoherently; upon\r\nthe application of a suppository, rose to stool, and passed copious\r\ndejections, with a bilious flux; no sleep. On the ninth, spasms. On\r\nthe tenth, slightly recollected. On the eleventh, slept; had perfect\r\nrecollection, but again immediately wandered; passed a large quantity\r\nof urine with spasms, (the attendants seldom putting her in mind,) it\r\nwas thick, white, like urine which has been shaken after it has stood\r\nfor a considerable time until it has subsided, but it had no sediment;\r\nin color and consistence, the urine resembled that of cattle, as far as\r\nI observed. About the fourteenth day, startings over the whole body;\r\ntalked much; slightly collected, but presently became again delirious.\r\nAbout the seventeenth day became speechless, on the twentieth died.[663]\r\n\r\nCASE V.--The wife of Epicrates, who was lodged at the house\r\nof Archigetes, being near the term of delivery, was seized with a\r\nviolent rigor, and, as was said, she did not become heated;[664] next\r\nday the same. On the third, she was delivered of a daughter, and\r\neverything went on properly. On the day following her delivery, she was\r\nseized with acute fever, pain in the cardiac region of the stomach, and\r\nin the genital parts. Having had a suppository, was in so far relieved;\r\npain in the head, neck, and loins; no sleep; alvine discharges scanty,\r\nbilious, thin, and unmixed; urine thin, and blackish. Towards the night\r\nof the sixth day from the time she was seized with the fever, became\r\ndelirious. On the seventh, all the symptoms exacerbated; insomnolency,\r\ndelirium, thirst; stools bilious, and high colored. On the eighth, had\r\na rigor; slept more. On the ninth, the same. On the tenth, her limbs\r\npainfully affected; pain again of the cardiac region of the stomach;\r\nheaviness of the head; no delirium; slept more; bowels constipated. On\r\nthe eleventh, passed urine of a better color, and having an abundant\r\nsediment; felt lighter. On the fourteenth had a rigor; acute fever. On\r\nthe fifteenth, had a copious vomiting of bilious and yellow matters;\r\nsweated; fever gone; at night acute fever; urine thick, sediment\r\nwhite.[665] On the seventeenth, an exacerbation; night uncomfortable;\r\nno sleep; delirium. On the eighteenth, thirsty; tongue parched; no\r\nsleep; much delirium; legs painfully affected. About the twentieth,\r\nin the morning, had a slight rigor; was comatose; slept tranquilly;\r\nhad slight vomiting of bilious and black matters; towards night\r\ndeafness. About the twenty-first, weight generally in the left side,\r\nwith pain; slight cough; urine thick, muddy, and reddish; when allowed\r\nto stand, had no sediment; in other respects felt lighter; fever not\r\ngone; fauces painful from the commencement, and red; uvula retracted;\r\ndefluxion remained acrid, pungent, and saltish throughout. About the\r\ntwenty-seventh, free of fever; sediment in the urine; pain in the side.\r\nAbout the thirty-first, was attacked with fever, bilious diarrhœa;\r\nslight bilious vomiting on the fortieth. Had a complete crisis, and was\r\nfreed from the fever on the eightieth day.[666]\r\n\r\nCASE VI.--Cleonactides, who was lodged above the Temple of\r\nHercules, was seized with a fever in an irregular form; was pained\r\nin the head and left side from the commencement, and had other\r\npains resembling those produced by fatigue: paroxysms of the fevers\r\ninconstant and irregular; occasional sweats; the paroxysms generally\r\nattacked on the critical days. About the twenty-fourth was cold in the\r\nextremities of the hands, vomitings bilious, yellow, and frequent,\r\nsoon turning to a verdigris-green color; general relief. About the\r\nthirtieth, began to have hemorrhage from both nostrils, and this\r\ncontinued in an irregular manner until near the crisis; did not loathe\r\nfood, and had no thirst throughout, nor was troubled with insomnolency;\r\nurine thin, and not devoid of color. When about the thirtieth day,\r\npassed reddish urine, having a copious red sediment; was relieved,\r\nbut afterwards the characters of the urine varied, sometimes having\r\nsediment, and sometimes not. On the sixtieth, the sediment in the urine\r\ncopious, white, and smooth; all the symptoms ameliorated; intermission\r\nof the fever; urine thin, and well colored. On the seventieth, fever\r\ngone for ten days. On the eightieth had a rigor, was seized with acute\r\nfever, sweated much; a red, smooth sediment in the urine; and a perfect\r\ncrisis.[667]\r\n\r\nCASE VII.--Meton was seized with fever; there was a painful\r\nweight in the loins. Next day, after drinking water pretty copiously,\r\nhad proper evacuations from the bowels. On the third, heaviness of\r\nthe head, stools thin, bilious, and reddish. On the fourth, all the\r\nsymptoms exacerbated; had twice a scanty trickling of blood from the\r\nright nostril; passed an uncomfortable night; alvine discharges like\r\nthose on the third day; urine darkish, had a darkish cloud floating in\r\nit, of a scattered form, which did not subside. On the fifth, a copious\r\nhemorrhage of pure blood from the left nostril; he sweated, and had a\r\ncrisis. After the fever restless, and had some delirium; urine thin,\r\nand darkish; had an affusion of warm water on the head; slept and\r\nrecovered his senses. In this case there was no relapse, but there were\r\nfrequent hemorrhages after the crisis.[668]\r\n\r\nCASE VIII.--Erasinus, who lived near the Canal of Bootes,\r\nwas seized with fever after supper; passed the night in an agitated\r\nstate. During the first day quiet, but in pain at night. On the\r\nsecond, symptoms all exacerbated; at night delirious. On the third,\r\nwas in a painful condition; great incoherence. On the fourth, in a\r\nmost uncomfortable state; had no sound sleep at night, but dreaming\r\nand talking; then all the appearances worse, of a formidable and\r\nalarming character; fear, impatience. On the morning of the fifth, was\r\ncomposed, and quite coherent, but long before noon was furiously mad,\r\nso that he could not constrain himself; extremities cold, and somewhat\r\nlivid; urine without sediment; died about sunset. The fever in this\r\ncase was accompanied by sweats throughout; the hypochondria were in\r\na state of meteorism, with distention and pain; the urine was black,\r\nhad round substances floating in it, which did not subside; the alvine\r\nevacuations were not stopped; thirst throughout not great; much spasms\r\nwith sweats about the time of death.[669]\r\n\r\nCASE IX.--Criton, in Thasus, while still on foot, and going\r\nabout, was seized with a violent pain in the great toe; he took to bed\r\nthe same day, had rigors and nausea, recovered his heat slightly, at\r\nnight was delirious. On the second, swelling of the whole foot, and\r\nabout the ankle erythema, with distention, and small bullæ (phlyctænæ);\r\nacute fever; he became furiously deranged; alvine discharges bilious,\r\nunmixed, and rather frequent. He died on the second day from the\r\ncommencement.[670]\r\n\r\nCASE X.--The Clazomenian who was lodged by the Well of Phrynichides\r\nwas seized with fever. He had pain in the head, neck, and loins from\r\nthe beginning, and immediately afterwards deafness; no sleep, acute\r\nfever, hypochondria elevated with a swelling, but not much distention;\r\ntongue dry. On the fourth, towards night, he became delirious. On the\r\nfifth, in an uneasy state. On the sixth, all the symptoms exacerbated.\r\nAbout the eleventh a slight remission; from the commencement to the\r\nfourteenth day the alvine discharges thin, copious, and of the color\r\nof water, but were well supported; the bowels then became constipated.\r\nUrine throughout thin, and well colored, and had many substances\r\nscattered through it, but no sediment. About the sixteenth, urine\r\nsomewhat thicker, which had a slight sediment; somewhat better, and\r\nmore collected. On the seventeenth, urine again thin; swellings about\r\nboth his ears, with pain; no sleep, some incoherence; legs painfully\r\naffected. On the twentieth, free of fever, had a crisis, no sweat,\r\nperfectly collected. About the twenty-seventh, violent pain of the\r\nright hip; it speedily went off. The swellings about the ears subsided,\r\nand did not suppurate, but were painful. About the thirty-first, a\r\ndiarrhœa, attended with a copious discharge of watery matter, and\r\nsymptoms of dysentery; passed thick urine; swellings about the ears\r\ngone. About the fortieth day, had pain in the right eye, sight dull. It\r\nwent away.[671]\r\n\r\nCASE XI.--The wife of Dromeades having been delivered of a\r\nfemale child, and all other matters going on properly, on the second\r\nday after was seized with rigor and acute fever. Began to have pain\r\nabout the hypochondrium on the first day; had nausea and incoherence,\r\nand for some hours afterwards had no sleep; respiration rare, large,\r\nand suddenly interrupted. On the day following that on which she had\r\nthe rigor, alvine discharges proper; urine thick, white, muddy, like\r\nurine which has been shaken after standing for some time, until the\r\nsediment had fallen to the bottom; it had no sediment; she did not\r\nsleep during the night. On the third day, about noon, had a rigor,\r\nacute fever; urine the same; pain of the hypochondria, nausea, an\r\nuncomfortable night, no sleep; a coldish sweat all over, but heat\r\nquickly restored. On the fourth, slight allevation of the symptoms\r\nabout the hypochondria; heaviness of the head, with pain; somewhat\r\ncomatose; slight epistaxis, tongue dry, thirst, urine thin and oily;\r\nslept a little, upon awaking was somewhat comatose; slight coldness,\r\nslept during the night, was delirious. On the morning of the sixth had\r\na rigor, but soon recovered her heat, sweated all over; extremities\r\ncold, was delirious, respiration rare and large. Shortly afterwards\r\nspasms from the head began, and she immediately expired.[672]\r\n\r\nCASE XII.--A man, in a heated state, took supper, and drank\r\nmore than enough; he vomited the whole during the night; acute fever,\r\npain of the right hypochondrium, a softish inflammation from the inner\r\npart; passed an uncomfortable night; urine at the commencement thick,\r\nred, but when allowed to stand, had no sediment, tongue dry, and not\r\nvery thirsty. On the fourth, acute fever, pains all over. On the fifth,\r\nurine smooth, oily, and copious; acute fever. On the sixth, in the\r\nevening, very incoherent, no sleep during the night. On the seventh,\r\nall the symptoms exacerbated; urine of the same characters; much\r\ntalking, and he could not contain himself; the bowels being stimulated,\r\npassed a watery discharge with lumbrici: night equally painful. In the\r\nmorning had a rigor; acute fever, hot sweat, appeared to be free of\r\nfever; did not sleep long; after the sleep a chill, ptyalism; in the\r\nevening, great incoherence; after a little, vomited a small quantity of\r\ndark bilious matters. On the ninth, coldness, much delirium, did not\r\nsleep. On the tenth, pains in the limbs, all the symptoms exacerbated;\r\nhe was delirious. On the eleventh, he died.[673]\r\n\r\nCASE XIII.--A woman, who lodged on the Quay, being three\r\nmonths gone with child, was seized with fever, and immediately began to\r\nhave pains in the loins. On the third day, pain of the head and neck,\r\nextending to the clavicle, and right hand; she immediately lost the\r\npower of speech; was paralyzed in the right hand, with spasms, after\r\nthe manner of paraplegia; was quite incoherent; passed an uncomfortable\r\nnight; did not sleep; disorder of the bowels, attended with bilious,\r\nunmixed, and scanty stools. On the fourth, recovered the use of her\r\ntongue; spasms of the same parts, and general pains remained; swelling\r\nin the hypochondrium, accompanied with pain; did not sleep, was quite\r\nincoherent; bowels disordered, urine thin, and not of a good color. On\r\nthe fifth, acute fever; pain of the hypochondrium, quite incoherent;\r\nalvine evacuations bilious; towards night had a sweat, and was freed\r\nfrom the fever. On the sixth, recovered her reason; was every way\r\nrelieved; the pain remained about the left clavicle; was thirsty,\r\nurine thin, had no sleep. On the seventh trembling, slight coma, some\r\nincoherence, pains about the clavicle and left arm remained; in all\r\nother respects was alleviated; quite coherent. For three days remained\r\nfree from fever. On the eleventh, had a relapse, with rigor and fever.\r\nAbout the fourteenth day, vomited pretty abundantly bilious and yellow\r\nmatters, had a sweat, the fever went off, by coming to a crisis.[674]\r\n\r\nCASE XIV.--Melidia, who lodged near the Temple of Juno, began to\r\nfeel a violent pain of the head, neck, and chest. She was straightway\r\nseized with acute fever; a slight appearance of the menses; continued\r\npains of all these parts. On the sixth, was affected with coma, nausea,\r\nand rigor; redness about the cheeks; slight delirium. On the seventh,\r\nhad a sweat; the fever intermitted, the pains remained. A relapse;\r\nlittle sleep; urine throughout of a good color, but thin; the alvine\r\nevacuations were thin, bilious, acrid, very scanty, black, and fetid;\r\na white, smooth sediment in the urine; had a sweat, and experienced a\r\nperfect crisis on the eleventh day.[675]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BOOK III.--OF THE EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nThough in the Argument prefixed to the First Book of the Epidemics I\r\nhave given a pretty full summary of the contents both of that book and\r\nthe third, I have still a few observations to make on some important\r\npoints, which were not sufficiently considered on that occasion; and\r\nthis I do the more readily, as it will afford me an opportunity of\r\nnoticing a subject on which M. Littré has bestowed very extensive\r\nresearch. I allude to the origin of the Glandular Plague. As I make it\r\na rule, in giving these my annotations, not to enter into any lengthy\r\ndetails, I shall now state, in a very succinct manner, the result of\r\nmy inquiries. The reader is referred, for a fuller discussion of the\r\nsubject, to the more ample disquisitions of M. Littré.[676]\r\n\r\nThe opinion has been pretty generally maintained by modern\r\nauthorities, that the first description which we have of the glandular\r\nplague of the East is that given by the historian Procopius, in the\r\nsixth century; and the inference drawn therefrom is that the disease\r\nwas unknown until his time. This opinion is still held, to a certain\r\nextent, by Hecker, Rosenbaum, Pariset, Nauman, and others of the most\r\ndistinguished scholars of the day, but it appears to be untenable after\r\nthe discovery of the “Fragment” of Ruffus, published by Mai, Rome,\r\n1831. As the passage is very important, I shall give a translation of\r\nit in this place. It is as follows: “The buboes called pestilential are\r\nmost fatal and acute, especially those which are seen occurring about\r\nLibya, Egypt, and Syria, and which are mentioned by Dionysius Curtus.\r\nDioscorides and Posidonius make much mention of them in the plague\r\nwhich occurred in their time in Libya; they say it was accompanied by\r\nacute fever, pain, and prostration of the whole body, delirium, and the\r\nappearance of large and hard buboes, which did not suppurate, not only\r\nin the accustomed parts, but also in the groins and armpits.” The only\r\nthing which detracts from the value of this paragraph is the difficulty\r\nof determining exactly who the authorities are which are referred to\r\nin it. Of Dionysius Curtus nothing is known; indeed it is more than\r\nprobable, that there is some mistake in this name. There are several\r\nmedical authors of the name of Dioscorides and Posidonius, and it is\r\ndifficult to determine to which of them reference is here made. Still,\r\nhowever, there seems to be no reason for questioning the authenticity\r\nof the passage. Ruffus, I may add, is generally admitted to have\r\nflourished in the reign of Trajan.[677]\r\n\r\nTo this important document let me join an interesting extract\r\nfrom Galen’s work “On Fevers.” Galen, _treating professedly of\r\nPestilential Fevers_, which he maintains are all connected with a\r\ntendency to putridity, expresses himself as follows: “Moreover, as\r\nHippocrates says, all fevers from buboes are bad, with the exception\r\nof ephemerals; although the bubo is also of the class of phlegmons.\r\nAnd I agree in so far with what is said of putrefaction, for this\r\nis the cause of the fever in inflammations, and not as Erasistratus\r\nsupposed.[678] But yet there are certain fevers from buboes of the\r\nclass of ephemerals, as certain others proclaim them to be; diseases\r\ndifficult to cure, which derive their origin from an inflammation,\r\nan ulcer, an abscess, or some other such affection in a viscus. But\r\nthe ephemeral fevers from buboes differ from those connected with\r\nputrefactions, either in a certain viscus, or in the hollow and very\r\nlarge vessels, that in those from buboes, which always impart their\r\nheat to the surrounding parts, the heat is communicated to the heart,\r\nand the putrefactive fume does not reach it, but remains circumscribed\r\nin the seat of the bubo, and the heat reaching the heart solely by a\r\nchange in the connecting parts, in like manner as in those exposed\r\nto excessive heat and fatigue, the diffusion of the heat takes\r\nplace from the parts first warmed to the source of vitality; but in\r\na putrefaction about the viscera and large vessels, a fume, as it\r\nwere, from the putrefying humors reaches the cavities of the heart,\r\netc.”[679] From these two passages alone, without taking into account\r\nseveral others of less importance, which might be gathered from other\r\nmedical authorities,[680] it must be quite obvious that the glandular\r\nplague was known, at all events, in the second century of the Christian\r\nera. Moreover it is equally clear, that Galen did not look upon it\r\nas a new disease, but considered that it was noticed in the works\r\nof Hippocrates. To my mind, then, there can be no doubt that the\r\npestilence which prevailed during the Peloponnesian war partook of the\r\nnature of the glandular plague. What has tended to create doubts on\r\nthis subject, in the minds of many learned men, is the omission of any\r\ndistinct mention of buboes in the graphic description of it given by\r\nThucydides. But it should always be taken into account that Thucydides\r\nwas not a professional man, and therefore there is a strong presumption\r\nthat his acquaintance with the disease, even although, as he states, he\r\nhimself had experienced an attack of it, must have been altogether of\r\na general nature. Indeed Galen, both in the treatise from which I have\r\nquoted above and in many other parts of his works, does not hesitate\r\nto declare, that the historian describes the disease as a common,\r\nthat is to say, a non-professional man, whereas Hippocrates gives\r\nits characters as a physician. It is also to be borne in mind, that\r\nthe description of it given by Thucydides applies to it only at its\r\noutbreak in the city of Athens, and it is a well-known characteristic\r\nof pestilential epidemics that they change very much during their\r\nprogress. This character of them was well illustrated in the Plague\r\nof Aleppo, so admirably described by Dr. Russel; for although the\r\nglandular form of the disease prevailed in a large number of cases, a\r\nconsiderable proportion of them were unaffected with buboes. Indeed\r\nit appears to me to be too much the practice for the profession, as\r\nwell as the public, to imagine to themselves a certain type or ideal\r\nof every disease, and when they do not recognize the exact characters\r\nwhich they fancy it should present, they immediately set down such\r\ncases as constituting an entirely different disease. This is an error\r\nthat is constantly committed, and one which I believe to be at the\r\nbottom of the discordant opinions which prevail among professional\r\nmen, on the subject of the glandular plague. It would be well for the\r\nphysician to bear in mind how many varieties of symptoms the fever\r\ndesignated as Typhus puts on,--some with the rash reckoned peculiar\r\nto this fever, and some without it,--some with petechiæ, and miliary\r\neruptions, and others without them; and many other complications of\r\nsymptoms, which are sometimes present and sometimes not.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the hypothesis lately advanced by Mr. Theod.\r\nKrause,[681] and in so far countenanced by M. Littré, that the plague\r\nof Athens was an epidemical variola, I must say that I can see no\r\nprobability in this supposition; for that a disease so strongly\r\nmarked as smallpox should have prevailed in ancient times, and yet\r\nnot be distinctly noticed by the Greek and Roman writers on medicine,\r\nI cannot conceive, more especially when we call to recollection the\r\nvery accurate descriptions which they have left us of other cutaneous\r\ndiseases, by no means attended with symptoms of so obvious a nature.\r\nIndeed it appears to me most wonderful, that such an opinion should\r\nhave been entertained by any person at all acquainted with the Arabic\r\nwriters on medicine, who described most distinctly both the plague and\r\nthe smallpox. Not to lose ourselves amidst a host of authorities, I\r\nwould refer the reader, in particular, to Avicenna, iv., 1, 4, where\r\nthe two diseases are treated of most distinctly, so that I cannot\r\nentertain a doubt that the Arabian physicians considered them to be\r\nessentially different.\r\n\r\nIn a considerable number of the cases reported in this book, there are\r\naffixed to them in the original certain characters, the interpretation\r\nof which the reader will find given in the translation. It will be\r\nnecessary, then, to give the reader some account of the origin of\r\nthese characters, regarding which our sole authority is Galen, who,\r\nin his Commentaries on this book, enters on the question in his\r\nusual elegant and attractive style. He admits that he derived his\r\ninformation principally from Zeuxis, one of his predecessors in the\r\noffice of commenting upon the works of Hippocrates. (See § 2, of the\r\nPreliminary Discourse.) It appears that Ptolemy Philadelphus was so\r\nzealous in his search for books to adorn his library, in Alexandria,\r\nthat he gave instructions to the masters of ships going on distant\r\nvoyages to collect all the books they could procure, and bring them\r\nback with them; that he ordered copies to be taken of books brought\r\nto him in this way, and kept the originals, but returned the copies,\r\nalong with large sums of money, in certain cases, to those who had\r\nlent them to him; and that the works so obtained were preserved in a\r\nseparate department of the library, with the inscription, “The Books\r\nof the Ships.” Among these was found a copy of the Third Book of the\r\nEpidemics, with the inscription, “One of the Books of the Ships,\r\naccording to the _redacteur_ Memnon of Sida.” Others say, that the\r\nterm “_redacteur_” was wanting, and that the book bore simply the\r\ninscription of “Memnon;” and that the servants of the king inscribed\r\nthe names of all the seamen who had brought these books, when they were\r\ninstalled on the shelves of the library. This, it would seem, was not\r\ndone immediately after their arrival in Alexandria, but that at first\r\nthey were collected together in certain houses. Memnon, the librarian,\r\nthen, is generally supposed to have surreptitiously introduced the\r\ncharacters into one of the copies, in order that he might raise himself\r\ninto importance by interpreting them. But whether or not this ruse was\r\nactually perpetrated by Memnon, the general belief of the commentators\r\nwas, that Hippocrates himself had nothing to do with them. In fact,\r\nZeno would appear to have been the only commentator who held them to\r\nbe genuine, and ascribed the introduction of them to our author. The\r\nopinion thus advanced by Zeno led him into a violent controversy with\r\nthe two Apollonii, namely, the Empiric and Biblas, who strenuously\r\nmaintained that the characters were an interpolation executed by\r\nMemnon. This came to be the settled opinion of the commentators,\r\nand among others of Galen, who, although he gives a key to the\r\ninterpretation of the characters, maintains, on all occasions, that\r\nthey are of no authority, and had in fact been forged by Memnon.\r\n\r\nThe following is the key which Galen gives to the interpretation\r\nof the characters: α, signifies ἀποφθορὰν, _abortion_, or ἀπώλειαν,\r\n_loss_; γ, signifies γονοειδὲς ὁυρον, _urine resembling semen_; δ,\r\npunctuated below, thus, δ, signifies ἱδρῶτα, _sweat_, and διάρροιαν,\r\n_diarrhœa_, and διαφόρησιν, _perspiration_, or in fact any other\r\n_evacuation_ which it is wished to express; ἐ, signifies ἐποχὴν,\r\n_retention_, or ἒδραν, _seat_; ζ, signifies ζήτημα, _the object\r\nof research_; θ, signifies θάνατον, _death_; ι, signifies ἱδρῶτα,\r\n_sweat_; κ, signifies κρίσιν, _crisis_, or κοιλιακὴν διάθεσιν; μ,\r\nsignifies μανίαν, _madness_, or μήτραν, _the womb_; ν, signifies\r\nνεότητα, _youth_, or νέκρωσιν, _mortification_; x, signifies ξανθὴν\r\nχολὴν, _yellow bile_, or ξένον τι καὶ σπάνιον, _something strange and\r\nrare_, or ξυσμὸν, _irritation_, or ξηρότητα, _dryness_; ο, signifies\r\nὀδύνας, _pains_, or οὖρον, _urine_ (but some think that it is only\r\nwhen it has a ὐ above it that it signifies urine); π signifies πλῆθος,\r\n_abundance_, or πτύελον, _sputum_, or πυρὸν (πυρρὸν?), _yellow_, or\r\nπυρετὸν, _fever_, or πνεύμονος τάθος, _affection of the lungs_; π, with\r\na character ι in its middle [symbol] or [symbol]), signifies πυθανὸν,\r\n_probable_; ρ, signifies ῥύσιν, _flux_, or ρίγος, _chill_; φ, signifies\r\nφρενῖτιν, _phrensy_; ς, signifies σπασμὸν, _convulsion_, or στομαχοῦ\r\nἢ στόματός κάκωσιν, _illness of the stomach or mouth_; τ, signifies\r\nτόκον, _accouchement_; υ, signifies ὑγείαν, _health_, or ὑποχόνδριον,\r\n_hypochondrium_; χ, signifies χολὴν, _bile_, or χολῶδες, _bilious_; ψ,\r\nsignifies ψύξιν, _congealing_; ω, signifies ὠμότητα, _crudity_. See\r\nGaleni Opera, t. v., p. 412, ed. Basil.; and Littré’s Hippocrates, t.\r\niii., p. 33.\r\n\r\nAccording to this key, the characters at the end of the first case are\r\nthus explained by Galen: they are [symbol]ΠΟΥΜΥ. Here, then, [symbol]\r\nsignifies πιθανὸν, _it is probable_, Π, πλῆθος, _that an abundance_,\r\nου, οὔρων, _of urine_; Μ, _on the 40th day_; Υ, ὑγείαν, _brought\r\nhealth_. It is more fully expressed thus by Galen: πιθανὸν ειναιδιὰ τὸ\r\nπλῆθος τῶν ἐκριθέντων όυρων ἀυτὸ λυρθῆναι τό νοσημα καὶ ὑγιῆ γενέσθαι\r\nτὸν ἄνθρωπον ἑν τῂ τεσσαρακοστῇ τῶν ἡμερῶν, that is to say, “_it is\r\nprobable that, owing to the copious discharge of urine, the disease was\r\nresolved, and the patient became well on the fortieth day_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BOOK III.--OF THE EPIDEMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SEC. I.\r\n\r\nCASE I.--Pythion, who lived by the Temple of the Earth, on\r\nthe first day, trembling commencing from his hands; acute fever,\r\ndelirium. On the second, all the symptoms were exacerbated. On the\r\nthird, the same. On the fourth alvine discharges scanty, unmixed, and\r\nbilious. On the fifth, all the symptoms were exacerbated, the tremors\r\nremained; little sleep, the bowels constipated. On the sixth sputa\r\nmixed, reddish. On the seventh, mouth drawn aside. On the eighth, all\r\nthe symptoms were exacerbated; the tremblings were again constant;\r\nurine, from the beginning to the eighth day, thin, and devoid of color;\r\nsubstances floating in it, cloudy. On the tenth he sweated; sputa\r\nsomewhat digested, had a crisis; urine thinnish about the crisis; but\r\nafter the crisis, on the fortieth day, an abscess about the anus, which\r\npassed off by a strangury.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the great\r\ndischarge of urine brought about the resolution of the disease, and the\r\ncure of the patient on the fortieth day.[682]\r\n\r\nCASE II.--Hermocrates, who lived by the New Wall,[683] was seized with\r\nfever. He began to have pain in the head and loins; an empty distention\r\nof the hypochondrium; the tongue at first was parched; deafness at the\r\ncommencement; there was no sleep; not very thirsty; urine thick and\r\nred, when allowed to stand it did not subside; alvine discharge very\r\ndry, and not scanty. On the fifth, urine thin, had substances floating\r\nin it which did not fall to the bottom;[684] at night he was delirious.\r\nOn the sixth, had jaundice;[685] all the symptoms were exacerbated;\r\nhad no recollection. On the seventh, in an uncomfortable state; urine\r\nthin, as formerly; on the following days the same. About the eleventh\r\nday, all the symptoms appeared to be lightened. Coma set in; urine\r\nthicker, reddish, thin substances below, had no sediment; by degrees he\r\nbecame collected. On the fourteenth, fever gone; had no sweat; slept,\r\nquite collected; urine of the same characters. About the seventeenth,\r\nhad a relapse, became hot. On the following days, acute fever, urine\r\nthin, was delirious. Again, on the twentieth, had a crisis; free of\r\nfever; had no sweat; no appetite through the whole time; was perfectly\r\ncollected; could not speak, tongue dry, without thirst; deep sleep.\r\nAbout the twenty-fourth day he became heated; bowels loose, with a\r\nthin, watery discharge; on the following days acute fever, tongue\r\nparched. On the twenty-seventh he died. In this patient deafness\r\ncontinued throughout;[686] the urine either thick and red, without\r\nsediment, or thin, devoid of color, and having substances floating in\r\nit; he could taste nothing.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that it was the\r\nsuppression of the discharges from the bowels which occasioned death on\r\nthe twenty-seventh day.\r\n\r\nCASE III.--The man who was lodged in the Garden of Dealces:[687] had\r\nheaviness of the head and pain in the right temple for a considerable\r\ntime, from some accidental cause, was seized with fever, and took to\r\nbed. On the second, there was a trickling of pure blood from the left\r\nnostril, but the alvine discharges were proper, urine thin, mixed,\r\nhaving small substances floating in it, like coarse barley meal, or\r\nsemen. On the third, acute fever; stools black, thin, frothy, a livid\r\nsediment in the dejections; slight coma; uneasiness at the times he\r\nhad to get up; sediment in the urine livid, and somewhat viscid. On\r\nthe fourth, slight vomiting of bilious, yellow matters, and, after a\r\nshort interval, of the color of verdigris; a few drops of pure blood\r\nran from the left nostril; stools the same; urine the same; sweated\r\nabout the head and clavicles; spleen enlarged, pain of the thigh on\r\nthe same side; loose swelling of the right hypochondrium; at night had\r\nno sleep, slight delirium. On the sixth, stools black, fatty, viscid,\r\nfetid; slept, more collected. On the seventh, tongue dry, thirsty,\r\ndid not sleep; was somewhat delirious; urine thin, not of a good\r\ncolor. On the eighth, stools black, scanty, and compact; slept, became\r\ncollected; not very thirsty. On the ninth had a rigor, acute fever,\r\nsweated, a chill, was delirious, strabismus of the right eye, tongue\r\ndry, thirsty, without sleep.[688] On the tenth, much the same. On the\r\neleventh, became quite collected; free from fever, slept, urine thin\r\nabout the crisis. The two following days without fever; it returned on\r\nthe fourteenth, then immediately insomnolency and complete delirium.\r\nOn the fifteenth, urine muddy, like that which has been shaken after\r\nthe sediment has fallen to the bottom; acute fever, quite delirious,\r\ndid not sleep; knees and legs painful; after a suppository, had\r\nalvine dejection of a black color. On the sixteenth, urine thin, had\r\na cloudy eneorema, was delirious. On the seventeenth, in the morning,\r\nextremities cold, was covered up with the bedclothes, acute fever,\r\ngeneral sweat, felt relieved, more collected; not free of fever,\r\nthirsty, vomited yellow bile, in small quantities; formed fæces passed\r\nfrom the bowels, but soon afterwards black, scanty, and thin; urine\r\nthin, not well colored. On the eighteenth, not collected, comatose.\r\nOn the nineteenth, in the same state. On the twentieth, slept; quite\r\ncollected, sweated, free from fever, not thirsty, but the urine thin.\r\nOn the twenty-first, slight delirium; somewhat thirsty, pain of the\r\nhypochondrium, and throbbing about the navel throughout. On the\r\ntwenty-fourth, sediment in the urine, quite collected. Twenty-seventh,\r\npain of the right hip joint; urine thin and bad, a sediment; all the\r\nother symptoms milder. About the twenty-ninth, pain of the right eye;\r\nurine thin. Fortieth, dejections pituitous, white, rather frequent;\r\nsweated abundantly all over; had a complete crisis.[689]\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that, by means of\r\nthe stools, the urine, and the sweat, this patient was cured in forty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SEC. II.\r\n\r\nCASE IV.--In Thasus, Philistes had headache of long continuance,\r\nand sometimes was confined to bed, with a tendency to deep sleep;\r\nhaving been seized with continual fevers from drinking, the pain was\r\nexacerbated; during the night he, at first, became hot. On the first\r\nday, he vomited some bilious matters, at first yellow, but afterwards\r\nof a verdigris-green color, and in greater quantity; formed fæces\r\npassed from the bowels; passed the night uncomfortably. On the second,\r\ndeafness, acute fever; retraction of the right hypochondrium; urine\r\nthin, transparent, had some small substances like semen floating in it;\r\ndelirium ferox about mid-day. On the third, in an uncomfortable state.\r\nOn the fourth, convulsions; all the symptoms exacerbated. On the fifth,\r\nearly in the morning, died.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the death of\r\nthe patient on the fifth day is to be attributed to a phrenitis, with\r\nunfavorable evacuations.[690]\r\n\r\nCASE V.--Charion, who was lodged at the house of Demænetus,\r\ncontracted a fever from drinking. Immediately he had a painful\r\nheaviness of the head; did not sleep; bowels disordered, with thin\r\nand somewhat bilious discharges. On the third day, acute fever;\r\ntrembling of the head, but especially of the lower lip; after a little\r\ntime a rigor, convulsions; he was quite delirious; passed the night\r\nuncomfortably. On the fourth, quiet, slept little, talked incoherently.\r\nOn the fifth, in pain; all the symptoms exacerbated; delirium; passed\r\nthe night uncomfortably; did not sleep. On the sixth, in the same\r\nstate. On the seventh had a rigor, acute fever, sweated all over his\r\nbody; had a crisis. Throughout the alvine discharges were bilious,\r\nscanty, and unmixed; urine thin, well colored, having cloudy substances\r\nfloating in it. About the eighth day, passed urine of a better color,\r\nhaving a white scanty sediment; was collected, free from fever for a\r\nseason. On the ninth it relapsed. About the fourteenth, acute fever. On\r\nthe sixteenth, vomited pretty frequently yellow, bilious matters. On\r\nthe seventeenth had a rigor, acute fever, sweated, free of fever; had a\r\ncrisis; urine, after the relapse and the crisis, well colored, having a\r\nsediment; neither was he delirious in the relapse. On the eighteenth,\r\nbecame a little heated; some thirst, urine thin, with cloudy substances\r\nfloating in it; slight wandering in his mind. About the nineteenth,\r\nfree of fever, had a pain in his neck; a sediment in the urine. Had a\r\ncomplete crisis on the twentieth.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the patient\r\nwas cured in twenty days, by the abundance of bilious stools and\r\nurine.[691]\r\n\r\nCASE VI.--The daughter of Euryanax, a maid, was taken ill of\r\nfever. She was free of thirst throughout, but had no relish for food.\r\nAlvine discharges small, urine thin, scanty, not well colored. In the\r\nbeginning of the fever, had a pain about the nates. On the sixth day,\r\nwas free of fever, did not sweat, had a crisis; the complaint about\r\nthe nates came to a small suppuration, and burst at the crisis. After\r\nthe crisis, on the seventh day, had a rigor, became slightly heated,\r\nsweated. On the eighth day after the rigor, had an inconsiderable\r\nrigor; the extremities cold ever after. About the tenth day, after\r\na sweat which came on, she became delirious, and again immediately\r\nafterwards was collected; these symptoms were said to have been brought\r\non by eating grapes. After an intermission of the twelfth day, she\r\nagain talked much incoherently; her bowels disordered with bilious,\r\nscanty, unmixed, thin, acrid discharges; she required to get frequently\r\nup. She died on the seventh day after the return of the delirium. At\r\nthe commencement of the disease she had pain in the throat, and it was\r\nred throughout; uvula retracted, defluxions abundant, thin, acrid;\r\ncoughed, but had no concocted sputa; during the whole time loathed all\r\nkinds of food, nor had the least desire of anything; had no thirst, nor\r\ndrank anything worth mentioning; was silent, and never spoke a word;\r\ndespondency; had no hopes of herself. She had a congenital tendency to\r\nphthisis.[692]\r\n\r\nCASE VII.--The woman affected with quinsy, who lodged in\r\nthe house of Aristion: her complaint began in the tongue; speech\r\ninarticulate; tongue red and parched. On the first day, felt chilly,\r\nand afterwards became heated. On the third day, a rigor, acute fever;\r\na reddish and hard swelling on both sides of the neck and chest,\r\nextremities cold and livid; respiration elevated; the drink returned\r\nby the nose; she could not swallow; alvine and urinary discharges\r\nsuppressed. On the fourth, all the symptoms were exacerbated. On the\r\nsixth she died of the quinsy.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the cause of\r\ndeath on the sixth day was the suppression of the discharges.[693]\r\n\r\nCASE VIII.--The young man who was lodged by the Liars’ Market\r\nwas seized with fever from fatigue, labor, and running out of season.\r\nOn the first day, the bowels disordered, with bilious, thin, and\r\ncopious dejections; urine thin and blackish; had no sleep; was thirsty.\r\nOn the second all the symptoms were exacerbated; dejections more\r\ncopious and unseasonable; he had no sleep; disorder of the intellect;\r\nslight sweat. On the third day, restless, thirst, nausea, much tossing\r\nabout, bewilderment, delirium; extremities livid and cold; softish\r\ndistention of the hypochrondrium on both sides. On the fourth, did not\r\nsleep; still worse. On the seventh he died. He was about twenty years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the cause of\r\nhis death on the seventh day was the unseasonable practices mentioned\r\nabove. An acute affection.[694]\r\n\r\nCASE IX.--The woman who lodged at the house of Tisamenas had a\r\ntroublesome attack of iliac passion; much vomiting; could not keep her\r\ndrink; pains about the hypochondria, and pains also in the lower part\r\nof the belly; constant tormina; not thirsty; became hot; extremities\r\ncold throughout, with nausea and insomnolency; urine scanty and thin;\r\ndejections undigested, thin, scanty. Nothing could do her any good. She\r\ndied.[695]\r\n\r\nCASE X.--A woman of those who lodged with Pantimides, from\r\na miscarriage, was taken ill of fever. On the first day, tongue dry,\r\nthirst, nausea, insomnolency, belly disordered, with thin, copious,\r\nundigested dejections. On the second day, had a rigor, acute fever;\r\nalvine discharges copious; had no sleep. On the third, pains greater.\r\nOn the fourth, delirious. On the seventh she died. Belly throughout\r\nloose, with copious, thin, undigested evacuations; urine scanty, thin.\r\nAn ardent fever.[696]\r\n\r\nCASE XI.--Another woman, after a miscarriage about the fifth month,\r\nthe wife of Ocetes, was seized with fever. At first had sometimes coma\r\nand sometimes insomnolency; pain of the loins; heaviness of the head.\r\nOn the second, the bowels were disordered, with scanty, thin, and at\r\nfirst unmixed dejections. On the third, more copious, and worse; at\r\nnight did not sleep. On the fourth was delirious; frights, despondency;\r\nstrabismus of the right eye; a faint cold sweat about the head;\r\nextremities cold. On the fifth day, all the symptoms were exacerbated;\r\ntalked much incoherently, and again immediately became collected; had\r\nno thirst; labored under insomnolency; alvine dejections copious, and\r\nunseasonable throughout; urine scanty, thin, darkish; extremities cold,\r\nsomewhat livid. On the sixth day, in the same state. On the seventh she\r\ndied. Phrenitis.[697]\r\n\r\nCASE XII.--A woman who lodged near the Liars’ Market, having\r\nthen brought forth a son in a first and difficult labor, was seized\r\nwith fever. Immediately on the commencement had thirst, nausea, and\r\ncardialgia; tongue dry; bowels disordered, with thin and scanty\r\ndejections; had no sleep. On the second, had slight rigor, acute fever;\r\na faint cold sweat about the head. On the third, painfully affected;\r\nevacuations from the bowels undigested, thin, and copious. On the\r\nfourth, had a rigor; all the symptoms exacerbated; insomnolency. On the\r\nfifth, in a painful state. On the sixth, in the same state; discharges\r\nfrom the bowels liquid and copious. On the seventh, had a rigor, fever\r\nacute; much thirst; much tossing about; towards evening a cold sweat\r\nover all; extremities cold; could no longer be kept warm; and again\r\nat night had a rigor; extremities could not be warmed; she did not\r\nsleep; was slightly delirious, and again speedily collected. On the\r\neighth, about mid-day, she became warm, was thirsty, comatose, had\r\nnausea; vomited small quantities of yellowish bile; restless at night,\r\ndid not sleep; passed frequently large quantities of urine without\r\nconsciousness. On the ninth, all the symptoms gave way; comatose,\r\ntowards evening slight rigors; small vomitings of bile. On the tenth,\r\nrigor; exacerbation of the fever, did not sleep at all; in the morning\r\npassed much urine having a sediment; extremities recovered their heat.\r\nOn the eleventh, vomited bile of a verdigris-green color; not long\r\nafter had a rigor, and again the extremities cold; towards evening a\r\nrigor, a cold sweat, much vomiting; passed a painful night. On the\r\ntwelfth, had copious black and fetid vomitings; much hiccup, painful\r\nthirst. On the thirteenth, vomitings black, fetid, and copious; rigor\r\nabout mid-day, loss of speech. On the fourteenth, some blood ran from\r\nher nose, she died. In this case the bowels were loose throughout; with\r\nrigors; her age about seventeen. An ardent fever.[698]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SECTION III.--CONSTITUTION 2.[699]\r\n\r\nThe year was southerly, rainy; no winds throughout.[700] Droughts\r\nhaving prevailed during the previous seasons of the year, the south\r\nwinds towards the rising of Arcturus were attended with much rain.\r\nAutumn gloomy and cloudy, with copious rains. Winter southerly, damp,\r\nand soft. But long after the solstice, and near the equinox, much\r\nwinterly weather out of season; and when now close to the equinox,\r\nnortherly, and winterly weather for no long time. The spring again\r\nsoutherly, calm, much rain throughout until the dog-days. Summer fine\r\nand hot; great suffocating heats. The Etesian winds blew small and\r\nirregular; again, about the season of Arcturus, much rains with north\r\nwinds. The year being southerly, damp, and soft towards winter, all\r\nwere healthy, except those affected with phthisis, of whom we shall\r\nwrite afterwards.\r\n\r\n3. Early in spring, along with the prevailing cold, there were many\r\ncases of erysipelas, some from a manifest cause, and some not.[701]\r\nThey were of a malignant nature, and proved fatal to many; many had\r\nsore-throat and loss of speech. There were many cases of ardent fever,\r\nphrensy, aphthous affections of the mouth,[702] tumors on the genital\r\norgans; of ophthalmia, anthrax,[703] disorder of the bowels, anorexia,\r\nwith thirst and without it; of disordered urine, large in quantity,\r\nand bad in quality; of persons affected with coma for a long time,\r\nand then falling into a state of insomnolency. There were many cases\r\nof failure of crisis, and many of unfavorable crisis; many of dropsy\r\nand of phthisis. Such were the diseases then epidemic.[704] There\r\nwere patients affected with every one of the species which have been\r\nmentioned, and many died. The symptoms in each of these cases were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n4. In many cases erysipelas, from some obvious cause, such as an\r\naccident, and sometimes from even a very small wound, broke out all\r\nover the body, especially, in persons about sixty years of age, about\r\nthe head, if such an accident was neglected in the slightest degree;\r\nand this happened in some who were under treatment; great inflammation\r\ntook place, and the erysipelas quickly spread all over.[705] In the\r\nmost of them the abscesses ended in suppurations, and there were great\r\nfallings off (sloughing) of the flesh, tendons, and bones; and the\r\ndefluxion which seated in the part was not like pus, but a sort of\r\nputrefaction, and the running was large and of various characters.\r\nThose cases in which any of these things happened about the head were\r\naccompanied with falling off of the hairs of the head and chin, the\r\nbones were laid bare and separated, and there were excessive runnings;\r\nand these symptoms happened in fevers and without fevers. But these\r\nthings were more formidable in appearance than dangerous; for when\r\nthe concoction in these cases turned to a suppuration, most of them\r\nrecovered; but when the inflammation and erysipelas disappeared, and\r\nwhen no abscess was formed, a great number of these died.[706] In like\r\nmanner, the same things happened to whatever part of the body the\r\ndisease wandered, for in many cases both forearm and arm dropped off;\r\nand in those cases in which it fell upon the sides, the parts there,\r\neither before or behind, got into a bad state; and in some cases the\r\nwhole femur and bones of the leg and whole foot were laid bare. But of\r\nall such cases, the most formidable were those which took place about\r\nthe pubes and genital organs.[707] Such was the nature of these cases\r\nwhen attended with sores, and proceeding from an external cause; but\r\nthe same things occurred in fevers, before fevers, and after fevers.\r\nBut those cases in which an abscess was formed, and turned to a\r\nsuppuration, or a seasonable diarrhœa or discharge of good urine took\r\nplace, were relieved thereby: but those cases in which none of these\r\nsymptoms occurred, but they disappeared without a crisis, proved fatal.\r\nThe greater number of these erysipelatous cases took place in the\r\nspring, but were prolonged through the summer and during autumn.\r\n\r\n5. In certain cases there was much disorder, and tumors about the\r\nfauces, and inflammations of the tongue, and abscesses about the\r\nteeth. And many were attacked with impairment or loss of speech;[708]\r\nat first, those in the commencement of phthisis, but also persons in\r\nardent fever and in phrenitis.\r\n\r\n6. The cases of ardent fever and phrenitis occurred early in spring\r\nafter the cold set in, and great numbers were taken ill at that time,\r\nand these cases were attended with acute and fatal symptoms. The\r\nconstitution of the ardent fevers which then occurred was as follows:\r\nat the commencement they were affected with coma, nausea, and rigors;\r\nfever not acute, not much thirst, nor delirium, slight epistaxis,[709]\r\nthe paroxysms for the most part on even days; and, about the time of\r\nthe paroxysms, forgetfulness, loss of strength and of speech, the\r\nextremities, that is to say, the hands and feet, at all times, but more\r\nespecially about the time of the paroxysms, were colder than natural;\r\nthey slowly and imperfectly became warmed, and again recovered their\r\nrecollection and speech.[710] They were constantly affected either with\r\ncoma, in which they got no sleep, or with insomnolency, attend with\r\npains;[711] most had disorders of the bowels, attended with undigested,\r\nthin, and copious evacuations; urine copious, thin, having nothing\r\ncritical nor favorable about it; neither was there any other critical\r\nappearance in persons affected thus; for neither was there any proper\r\nhemorrhage, nor any other of the accustomed evacuations, to prove a\r\ncrisis. They died, as it happened, in an irregular manner, mostly about\r\nthe crisis, but in some instances after having lost their speech for a\r\nlong time, and having had copious sweats. These were the symptoms which\r\nmarked the fatal cases of ardent fever; similar symptoms occurred in\r\nthe phrenitic cases; but these were particularly free from thirst, and\r\nnone of these had wild delirium[712] as in other cases, but they died\r\noppressed by a bad tendency to sleep, and stupor.\r\n\r\n7. But there were also other fevers, as will be described. Many had\r\ntheir mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also many\r\ndefluxions about the genital parts, and ulcerations, boils (phymata),\r\nexternally and internally, about the groins.[713] Watery ophthalmies of\r\na chronic character, with pains; fungous excrescences of the eyelids,\r\nexternally and internally, called fici, which destroyed the sight of\r\nmany persons.[714] There were fungous growths, in many other instances,\r\non ulcers, especially on those seated on the genital organs. There\r\nwere many attacks of carbuncle (anthrax) through the summer, and other\r\naffections, which are called “the putrefaction” (_seps_); also\r\nlarge ecthymata,[715] and large tetters (_herpetes_) in many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n8. And many and serious complaints attacked many persons in the\r\nregion of the belly. In the first place, tenesmus, accompanied with\r\npain, attacked many, but more especially children, and all who had\r\nnot attained to puberty; and the most of these died. There were many\r\ncases of lientery and of dysentery; but these were not attended with\r\nmuch pain.[716] The evacuations were bilious, and fatty, and thin, and\r\nwatery; in many instances the disease terminated in this way, with and\r\nwithout fever; there were painful tormina and volvuli of a malignant\r\nkind; copious evacuations of the contents of the guts, and yet much\r\nremained behind; and the passages did not carry off the pains, but\r\nyielded with difficulty to the means administered; for in most cases\r\npurgings were hurtful to those affected in this manner; many died\r\nspeedily, but in many others they held out longer. In a word, all\r\ndied, both those who had acute attacks and those who had chronic, most\r\nespecially from affections of the belly, for it was the belly which\r\ncarried them all off.\r\n\r\n9. All persons had an aversion to food in all the afore-mentioned\r\ncomplaints to a degree such as I never met with before,[717] and\r\npersons in these complaints most especially, and those recovering from\r\nthem, and in all other diseases of a mortal nature. Some were troubled\r\nwith thirst, and some not; and both in febrile complaints and in others\r\nno one drank unseasonably or disobeyed injunctions.\r\n\r\n10. The urine in many cases was not in proportion to the drink\r\nadministered, but greatly in excess; and the badness of the urine\r\nvoided was great, for it had not the proper thickness, nor concoction,\r\nnor purged properly; for in many cases purgings by the bladder indicate\r\nfavorably, but in the greatest number they indicated a melting of the\r\nbody, disorder of the bowels, pains, and a want of crisis.[718]\r\n\r\n11. Persons laboring under phrenitis and causus were particularly\r\ndisposed to coma; but also in all other great diseases which occurred\r\nalong with fever. In the main, most cases were attended either by heavy\r\ncoma, or by short and light sleep.\r\n\r\n12. And many other forms of fevers were then epidemic, of tertian,\r\nof quartan, of nocturnal,[719] of continual, of chronic, of erratic,\r\nof fevers attended with nausea, and of irregular fevers. All these\r\nwere attended with much disorder, for the bowels in most cases\r\nwere disordered, accompanied with rigors, sweats not of a critical\r\ncharacter, and with the state of the urine as described. In most\r\ninstances the disease was protracted, for neither did the deposits\r\nwhich took place prove critical as in other cases; for in all\r\ncomplaints and in all cases there was difficulty of crisis, want of\r\ncrisis, and protraction of the disease, but most especially in these.\r\nA few had the crisis about the eightieth day, but in most instances\r\nit (the disease?) left them irregularly. A few of them died of dropsy\r\nwithout being confined to bed. And in many other diseases people were\r\ntroubled with swelling, but more especially in phthisical cases.\r\n\r\n13. The greatest and most dangerous disease, and the one that proved\r\nfatal to the greatest number, was the consumption.[720] With many\r\npersons it commenced during the winter, and of these some were confined\r\nto bed, and others bore up on foot; the most of those died early in\r\nspring who were confined to bed; of the others, the cough left not a\r\nsingle person, but it became milder through the summer; during the\r\nautumn, all these were confined to bed, and many of them died, but\r\nin the greater number of cases the disease was long protracted. Most\r\nof these were suddenly attacked with these diseases, having frequent\r\nrigors, often continual and acute fevers; unseasonable, copious, and\r\ncold sweats throughout; great coldness, from which they had great\r\ndifficulty in being restored to heat; the bowels variously constipated,\r\nand again immediately in a loose state, but towards the termination\r\nin all cases with violent looseness of the bowels; a determination\r\ndownwards of all matters collected about the lungs; urine excessive,\r\nand not good; troublesome melting. The coughs throughout were frequent,\r\nand sputa copious, digested, and liquid, but not brought up with much\r\npain; and even when they had some slight pain, in all cases the purging\r\nof the matters about the lungs went on mildly. The fauces were not\r\nvery irritable, nor were they troubled with any saltish humors; but\r\nthere were viscid, white, liquid, frothy, and copious defluxions from\r\nthe head. But by far the greatest mischief attending these and the\r\nother complaints, was the aversion to food, as has been described.\r\nFor neither had they any relish for drink along with their food, but\r\ncontinued without thirst. There was heaviness of the body, disposition\r\nto coma, in most cases swelling, which ended in dropsy; they had\r\nrigors, and were delirious towards death.\r\n\r\n14. The form of body peculiarly subject to phthisical complaints was\r\nthe smooth, the whitish, that resembling the lentil; the reddish, the\r\nblue-eyed, the leucophlegmatic,[721] and that with the scapulæ having\r\nthe appearance of wings: and women in like manner,[722] with regard to\r\nthe melancholic and subsanguineous, phrenitic and dysenteric affections\r\nprincipally attacked them. Tenesmus troubled young persons of a\r\nphlegmatic temperament. Chronic diarrhœa, acrid and viscid discharges\r\nfrom the bowels, attacked those who were troubled with bitter bile.\r\n\r\n15. To all those which have been described, the season of spring was\r\nmost inimical, and proved fatal to the greatest numbers: the summer was\r\nthe most favorable to them, and the fewest died then; in autumn, and\r\nunder the Pleiades, again there died great numbers. It appears to me,\r\naccording to the reason of things, that the coming on of summer should\r\nhave done good in these cases; for winter coming on cures the diseases\r\nof summer, and summer coming on removes the diseases of winter. And\r\nyet the summer in question was not of itself well constituted, for it\r\nbecame suddenly hot, southerly, and calm; but, notwithstanding, it\r\nproved beneficial by producing a change on the other constitution.\r\n\r\n16. I look upon it as being a great part of the art to be able to judge\r\nproperly of that which has been written. For he that knows and makes a\r\nproper use of these things, would appear to me not likely to commit any\r\ngreat mistake in the art. He ought to learn accurately the constitution\r\nof every one of the seasons, and of the diseases; whatever that is\r\ncommon in each constitution and disease is good, and whatever is bad;\r\nwhatever disease will be protracted and end in death, and whatever\r\nwill be protracted and end in recovery; which disease of an acute\r\nnature will end in death, and which in recovery. From these it is easy\r\nto know the order of the critical days, and prognosticate from them\r\naccordingly. And to a person who is skilled in these things, it is easy\r\nto know to whom, when, and how aliment ought to be administered.[723]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SEC. 17. SIXTEEN CASES.[724]\r\n\r\nCASE I.--In Thasus, the Parian who lodged above the Temple\r\nof Diana was seized with an acute fever, at first of a continual and\r\nardent type; thirsty, inclined to be comatose at first, and afterwards\r\ntroubled with insomnolency; bowels disordered at the beginning, urine\r\nthin. On the sixth day, passed oily urine, was delirious. On the\r\nseventh, all the symptoms were exacerbated; had no sleep, but the\r\nurine of the same characters, and the understanding disordered; alvine\r\ndejections bilious and fatty. On the eighth, a slight epistaxis; small\r\nvomiting of verdigris-green matters; slept a little. On the ninth,\r\nin the same state. On the tenth, all the symptoms gave way. On the\r\neleventh, he sweated, but not over the whole body; he became cold, but\r\nimmediately recovered his heat again. On the fourteenth, acute fever;\r\ndischarges bilious, thin, and copious; substances floating in the\r\nurine; he became incoherent. On the seventeenth, in a painful state,\r\nfor he had no sleep, and the fever was more intense. On the twentieth,\r\nsweated all over; apyrexia, dejections bilious; aversion to food,\r\ncomatose. On the twenty-fourth, had a relapse. On the thirty-fourth,\r\napyrexia; bowels not confined; and he again recovered his heat.\r\nFortieth, apyrexia, bowels confined for no long time, aversion to\r\nfood; had again slight symptoms of fever, and throughout in an\r\nirregular form; apyrexia at times, and at others not; for if the fever\r\nintermitted, and was alleviated for a little, it immediately relapsed\r\nagain; he used much and improper food; sleep bad; about the time of\r\nthe relapse he was delirious; passed thick urine at that time, but\r\ntroubled, and of bad characters; bowels at first confined, and again\r\nloose; slight fevers of a continual type; discharges copious and thin.\r\nOn the hundred and twentieth day he died. In this patient the bowels\r\nwere constantly from the first either loose, with bilious, liquid, and\r\ncopious dejection, or constipated with hot and undigested fæces; the\r\nurine throughout bad; for the most part coma, or insomnolency with\r\npain; continued aversion to food. Ardent fever.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the\r\nweakness produced by the fever, the phrenitis, and affection of the\r\nhypochondrium caused death on the hundred and twentieth day.[725]\r\n\r\nCASE II.--In Thasus, the woman who lodged near the Cold Water, on\r\nthe third day after delivery of a daughter, the lochial discharge not\r\ntaking place, was seized with acute fever, accompanied with rigors.\r\nBut a considerable time before delivery she was feverish, confined to\r\nbed, and loathed her food. After the rigor which took place, continual\r\nand acute fevers, with rigors. On the eighth and following days, was\r\nvery incoherent, and immediately afterwards became collected; bowels\r\ndisordered, with copious, thin, watery, and bilious stools; no thirst.\r\nOn the eleventh was collected, but disposed to coma; urine copious,\r\nthin, and black; no sleep. On the twentieth, slight chills, and\r\nimmediately afterwards was warm; slight incoherence; no sleep; with\r\nregard to the bowels, in the same condition; urine watery, and copious.\r\nOn the twenty-seventh, free from fever; bowels constipated; not long\r\nafterwards violent pain of the right hip-joint for a considerable time;\r\nfevers afterwards supervened; urine watery. On the fortieth, complaints\r\nabout the hip-joint better; continued coughs, with copious, watery\r\nsputa; bowels constipated; aversion to food; urine the same; fever\r\nnot leaving her entirely, but having paroxysms in an irregular form,\r\nsometimes present, sometimes not. On the sixtieth, the coughs left her\r\nwithout a crisis, for no concoction of the sputa took place, nor any\r\nof the usual abscesses; jaw on the right side convulsively retracted;\r\ncomatose, was again incoherent, and immediately became collected; utter\r\naversion to food; the jaw became relaxed; alvine discharges small,\r\nand bilious; fever more acute, affected with rigors; on the following\r\ndays lost her speech, and again became collected, and talked. On the\r\neightieth she died. In this case the urine throughout was black, thin,\r\nand watery; coma supervened; there was aversion to food, despondency,\r\nand insomnolency; irritability, restlessness; she was of a melancholic\r\nturn of mind.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters_. It is probable that the suppression of\r\nthe lochial discharge caused death on the eightieth day.[726]\r\n\r\nCASE III.--In Thasus, Pythion, who was lodged above the Temple of\r\nHercules, from labor, fatigue, and neglected diet, was seized with\r\nstrong rigor and acute fever; tongue dry, thirsty, and bilious; had\r\nno sleep; urine darkish, eneorema floating on the top of the urine,\r\ndid not subside. On the second day, about noon, coldness of the\r\nextremities, especially about the hands and head; loss of speech and\r\nof articulation; breathing short for a considerable time; recovered\r\nhis heat; thirst; passed the night quietly; slight sweats about the\r\nhead. On the third, passed the day in a composed state; in the evening,\r\nabout sunset, slight chills; nausea, agitation; passed the night in\r\na painful state; had no sleep; small stools of compact fæces passed\r\nfrom the bowels. On the fourth, in the morning, composed; about noon\r\nall the symptoms became exacerbated; coldness, loss of speech, and of\r\narticulation; became worse; recovered his heat after a time; passed\r\nblack urine, having substances floating in it; the night quiet; slept.\r\nOn the fifth, seemed to be lightened, but a painful weight about the\r\nbelly; thirsty, passed the night in a painful state. On the sixth, in\r\nthe morning, in a quiet state; in the evening the pains greater; had a\r\nparoxysm; in the evening the bowels properly opened by a small clyster;\r\nslept at night. On the seventh, during the day, in a state of nausea,\r\nsomewhat disturbed; passed urine of the appearance of oil; at night,\r\nmuch agitation, was incoherent, did not sleep. On the eighth, in the\r\nmorning, slept a little; but immediately coldness, loss of speech,\r\nrespiration small and weak; but in the evening recovered his heat\r\nagain; was delirious, but towards day was somewhat lightened; stools\r\nsmall, bilious, and unmixed. On the ninth, affected with coma, and with\r\nnausea when roused; not very thirsty; about sunset he became restless\r\nand incoherent; passed a bad night. On the tenth, in the morning, had\r\nbecome speechless; great coldness; acute fever; much perspiration; he\r\ndied. His sufferings were on the even days.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the excessive\r\nsweats caused death on the tenth day.[727]\r\n\r\nCASE IV.--The patient affected with phrenitis, having taken\r\nto bed on the first day, vomited largely of verdigris-green and thin\r\nmatters; fever, accompanied with rigors, copious and continued sweats\r\nall over; heaviness of the head and neck, with pain; urine thin,\r\nsubstances floating in the urine small, scattered, did not subside;\r\nhad copious dejections from the bowels; very delirious; no sleep. On\r\nthe second, in the morning, loss of speech; acute fever; he sweated,\r\nfever did not leave him; palpitations over the whole body, at night,\r\nconvulsions. On the third, all the symptoms exacerbated; he died.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the sweats\r\nand convulsions caused death.[728]\r\n\r\nCASE V.--In Larissa, a man, who was bald, suddenly was seized with\r\npain in the right thigh; none of the things which were administered\r\ndid him any good. On the first day, fever acute, of the ardent type,\r\nnot agitated, but the pains persisted. On the second, the pains in the\r\nthigh abated, but the fever increased; somewhat tossed about; did not\r\nsleep; extremities cold; passed a large quantity of urine, not of a\r\ngood character. On the third, the pain of the thigh ceased; derangement\r\nof the intellect, confusion, and much tossing about. On the fourth,\r\nabout noon, he died. An acute disease.[729]\r\n\r\nCASE VI.--In Abdera, Pericles was seized with a fever of the acute,\r\ncontinual type, with pain; much thirst, nausea, could not retain his\r\ndrink; somewhat swelled about the spleen, with heaviness of the head.\r\nOn the first day, had hemorrhage from the left nostril, but still the\r\nfever became more violent; passed much muddy, white urine, which when\r\nallowed to stand did not subside. On the second day, all the symptoms\r\nwere exacerbated, yet the urine was thick, and more inclined to have a\r\nsediment; the nausea less; he slept. On the third, fever was milder;\r\nabundance of urine, which was concocted, and had a copious sediment;\r\npassed a quiet night. On the fourth, had a copious and warm sweat all\r\nover about noon; was free of fever, had a crisis, no relapse. An acute\r\naffection.[730]\r\n\r\nCASE VII.--In Abdera, the young woman who was lodged in the\r\nSacred Walk was seized with an ardent fever. She was thirsty, and could\r\nnot sleep; had menstruation for the first time. On the sixth, much\r\nnausea, flushing, was chilly, and tossed about. On the seventh, in the\r\nsame state; urine thin, but of a good color; no disturbance about the\r\nbowels. On the eighth, deafness, acute fever, insomnolency, nausea,\r\nrigors, became collected; urine the same. On the ninth, in the same\r\nstate, and also on the following days; thus the deafness persisted. On\r\nthe fourteenth, disorder of the intellect; the fever abated. On the\r\nseventeenth, a copious hemorrhage from the nose; the deafness slightly\r\nbetter; and on the following days, nausea, deafness, and incoherence.\r\nOn the twentieth, pain of the feet; deafness and delirium left her; a\r\nsmall hemorrhage from the nose; sweat, apyrexia. On the twenty-fourth,\r\nthe fever returned, deafness again; pain of the feet remained;\r\nincoherence. On the twenty-seventh, had a copious sweat, apyrexia;\r\nthe deafness left her; the pain of her feet partly remained; in other\r\nrespects had a complete crisis.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the\r\nrestoration of health on the twentieth day was the result of the\r\nevacuation of urine.[731]\r\n\r\nCASE VIII.--In Abdera, Anaxion, who was lodged near the Thracian\r\nGates, was seized with an acute fever; continued pain of the right\r\nside; dry cough, without expectoration during the first days, thirst,\r\ninsomnolency; urine well colored, copious, and thin. On the sixth,\r\ndelirious; no relief from the warm applications. On the seventh, in\r\na painful state, for the fever increased, while the pains did not\r\nabate, and the cough was troublesome, and attended with dyspnœa. On\r\nthe eighth, I opened a vein at the elbow, and much blood, of a proper\r\ncharacter, flowed; the pains were abated, but the dry coughs continued.\r\nOn the eleventh, the fever diminished; slight sweats about the head;\r\ncoughs, with more liquid sputa; he was relieved. On the twentieth,\r\nsweat, apyrexia; but after the crisis he was thirsty, and the\r\nexpectorations were not good. On the twenty-seventh the fever relapsed;\r\nhe coughed, and brought up much concocted sputa: sediment in the urine\r\ncopious and white; he became free of thirst, and the respiration was\r\ngood. On the thirty-fourth, sweated all over, apyrexia, general crisis.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the evacuation of\r\nthe sputa brought about the recovery on the thirty-fourth day.[732]\r\n\r\nCASE IX.--In Abdera, Heropythus, while still on foot, had\r\npain in the head, and not long afterwards he took to bed; he lived\r\nnear the High Street. Was seized with acute fever of the ardent type;\r\nvomitings at first of much bilious matter; thirst; great restlessness;\r\nurine thin, black, substances sometimes floating high in it, and\r\nsometimes not; passed the night in a painful state; paroxysms of\r\nthe fever diversified, and for the most part irregular. About the\r\nfourteenth day, deafness; the fever increased; urine the same. On\r\nthe twentieth and following days, much delirium. On the thirtieth,\r\ncopious hemorrhage from the nose, and became more collected; deafness\r\ncontinued, but less; the fever diminished; on the following days,\r\nfrequent hemorrhages, at short intervals. About the sixtieth, the\r\nhemorrhages ceased, but violent pain of the hip-joint, and increase\r\nof fever. Not long afterwards, pains of all the inferior parts; it\r\nthen became a rule, that either the fever and deafness increased, or,\r\nif these abated and were lightened, the pains of the inferior parts\r\nwere increased. About the eightieth day, all the complaints gave way,\r\nwithout leaving any behind; for the urine was of a good color, and had\r\na copious sediment, while the delirium became less. About the hundredth\r\nday, disorder of the bowels, with copious and bilious evacuations,\r\nand these continued for a considerable time, and again assumed the\r\ndysenteric form with pain; but relief of all the other complaints. On\r\nthe whole, the fevers went off, and the deafness ceased. On the hundred\r\nand twentieth day, had a complete crisis. Ardent fever.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the bilious\r\ndischarge brought about the recovery on the hundred and twentieth\r\nday.[733]\r\n\r\nCASE X.--In Abdera, Nicodemus was seized with fever from\r\nvenery and drinking. At the commencement he was troubled with nausea\r\nand cardialgia; thirsty, tongue was parched; urine thin and dark. On\r\nthe second day, the fever exacerbated; he was troubled with rigors\r\nand nausea; had no sleep; vomited yellow bile; urine the same;\r\npassed a quiet night, and slept. On the third, a general remission;\r\namelioration; but about sunset felt again somewhat uncomfortable;\r\npassed an uneasy night. On the fourth, rigor, much fever, general\r\npains; urine thin, with substances floating in it; again a quiet night.\r\nOn the fifth, all the symptoms remained, but there was an amelioration.\r\nOn the sixth, some general pains; substances floating in the urine;\r\nvery incoherent. On the seventh, better. On the eighth, all the other\r\nsymptoms abated. On the tenth, and following days, there were pains,\r\nbut all less; in this case throughout, the paroxysms and pains were\r\ngreater on the even days. On the twentieth, the urine white and thick,\r\nbut when allowed to stand had no sediment; much sweat; seemed to be\r\nfree from fever; but again in the evening he became hot, with the same\r\npains, rigor, thirst, slightly incoherent. On the twenty-fourth, urine\r\ncopious, white, with an abundant sediment; a copious and warm sweat all\r\nover; apyrexia; the fever came to its crisis.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that the cure was\r\nowing to the bilious evacuations and the sweats.[734]\r\n\r\nCASE XI.--In Thasus, a woman, of a melancholic turn of mind, from\r\nsome accidental cause of sorrow, while still going about, became\r\naffected with loss of sleep, aversion to food, and had thirst and\r\nnausea. She lived near the Pylades, upon the Plain. On the first,\r\nat the commencement of night, frights, much talking; despondency,\r\nslight fever; in the morning, frequent spasms, and when they ceased,\r\nshe was incoherent and talked obscurely; pains frequent, great, and\r\ncontinued. On the second, in the same state; had no sleep; fever more\r\nacute. On the third, the spasms left her; but coma, and disposition\r\nto sleep, and again awake, started up, and could not contain herself;\r\nmuch incoherence; acute fever; on that night a copious sweat all over;\r\napyrexia, slept, quite collected; had a crisis. About the third day,\r\nthe urine black, thin, substances floating in it generally round, did\r\nnot fall to the bottom; about the crisis a copious menstruation.[735]\r\n\r\nCASE XII.--In Larissa,[736] a young unmarried woman was seized\r\nwith a fever of the acute and ardent type; insomnolency, thirst; tongue\r\nsooty and dry; urine of a good color, but thin. On the second, in an\r\nuneasy state, did not sleep. On the third, alvine discharges copious,\r\nwatery, and greenish, and on the following days passed such with\r\nrelief. On the fourth, passed a small quantity of thin urine, having\r\nsubstances floating towards its surface, which did not subside; was\r\ndelirious towards night. On the sixth, a great hemorrhage from the\r\nnose; a chill, with a copious and hot sweat all over; apyrexia, had a\r\ncrisis. In the fever, and when it had passed the crisis, the menses\r\ntook place for the first time, for she was a young woman. Throughout\r\nshe was oppressed with nausea, and rigors; redness of the face; pain of\r\nthe eyes; heaviness of the head; she had no relapse, but the fever came\r\nto a crisis. The pains were on the even days.[737]\r\n\r\nCASE XIII.--Apollonius, in Abdera, bore up (under the fever?) for\r\nsome time, without betaking himself to bed. His viscera were enlarged,\r\nand for a considerable time there was a constant pain about the liver,\r\nand then he became affected with jaundice; he was flatulent, and of\r\na whitish complexion. Having eaten beef, and drunk unseasonably, he\r\nbecame a little heated at first, and betook himself to bed, and having\r\nused large quantities of milk, that of goats and sheep, and both boiled\r\nand raw, with a bad diet otherwise, great mischief was occasioned by\r\nall these things; for the fever was exacerbated, and of the food taken\r\nscarcely any portion worth mentioning was passed from the bowels;\r\nthe urine was thin and scanty; no sleep; troublesome meteorism;\r\nmuch thirst; disposition to coma; painful swelling of the right\r\nhypochondrium; extremities altogether coldish; slight incoherence,\r\nforgetfulness of everything he said; he was beside himself. About\r\nthe fourteenth day after he betook himself to bed, had a rigor,\r\nbecame heated, and was seized with furious delirium; loud cries, much\r\ntalking, again composed, and then coma came on; afterwards the bowels\r\ndisordered, with copious, bilious, unmixed, and undigested stools;\r\nurine black, scanty, and thin; much restlessness; alvine evacuations of\r\nvaried characters, either black, scanty, and verdigris-green, or fatty,\r\nundigested, and acrid; and at times the dejections resembled milk.\r\nAbout the twenty-fourth, enjoyed a calm; other matters in the same\r\nstate; became somewhat collected; remembered nothing that had happened\r\nsince he was confined to bed; immediately afterwards became delirious;\r\nevery symptom rapidly getting worse. About the thirtieth, acute fever;\r\nstools copious and thin; was delirious; extremities cold; loss of\r\nspeech. On the thirty-fourth he died. In this case, as far as I saw,\r\nthe bowels were disordered; urine thin and black; disposition to coma;\r\ninsomnolency; extremities cold; delirious throughout. Phrenitis.[738]\r\n\r\nCASE XIV.--In Cyzicus,[739] a woman who had brought forth twin\r\ndaughters, after a difficult labor, and in whom the lochial discharge\r\nwas insufficient, at first was seized with an acute fever, attended\r\nwith chills; heaviness of the head and neck, with pain; insomnolency\r\nfrom the commencement; she was silent, sullen, and disobedient; urine\r\nthin, and devoid of color; thirst, nausea for the most part; bowels\r\nirregularly disordered, and again constipated. On the sixth, towards\r\nnight, talked much incoherently; had no sleep. About the eleventh day\r\nwas seized with wild delirium, and again became collected; urine black,\r\nthin, and again deficient, and of an oily appearance; copious, thin,\r\nand disordered evacuations from the bowels. On the fourteenth, frequent\r\nconvulsions; extremities cold; not in anywise collected; suppression of\r\nurine. On the sixteenth loss of speech. On the seventeenth, she died.\r\nPhrenitis.\r\n\r\n_Explanation of the characters._ It is probable that death\r\nwas caused, on the seventeenth day, by the affection of the brain\r\nconsequent upon her accouchement.[740]\r\n\r\nCASE XV.--In Thasus, the wife of Dealces, who was lodged upon\r\nthe Plain, from sorrow was seized with an acute fever, attended with\r\nchills. From first to last she wrapped herself up in her bedclothes;\r\nstill silent, she fumbled, picked, bored, and gathered hairs (from\r\nthem); tears, and again laughter; no sleep; bowels irritable, but\r\npassed nothing; when directed, drank a little; urine thin and scanty;\r\nto the touch of the hand the fever was slight; coldness of the\r\nextremities. On the ninth, talked much incoherently, and again became\r\ncomposed and silent. On the fourteenth, breathing rare, large, at\r\nintervals; and again hurried respiration. On the sixteenth, looseness\r\nof the bowels from a stimulant clyster; afterwards she passed her\r\ndrink, nor could retain anything, for she was completely insensible;\r\nskin parched and tense. On the twentieth, much talk, and again became\r\ncomposed; loss of speech; respiration hurried. On the twenty-first she\r\ndied. Her respiration throughout was rare and large; she was totally\r\ninsensible; always wrapped up in her bedclothes; either much talk, or\r\ncomplete silence throughout. Phrenitis.[741]\r\n\r\nCASE XVI.--In Melibœa,[742] a young man having become heated by\r\ndrinking and much venery, was confined to bed; he was affected with\r\nrigors and nausea; insomnolency and absence of thirst. On the first\r\nday much fæces passed from the bowels along with a copious flux; and\r\non the following days he passed many watery. stools of a green color;\r\nurine thin, scanty, and deficient in color; respiration rare, large,\r\nat long intervals; softish distention of the hypochondrium, of an\r\noblong form, on both sides; continued palpitation in the epigastric\r\nregion throughout; passed urine of an oily appearance. On the tenth,\r\nhe had calm delirium, for he was naturally of an orderly and quiet\r\ndisposition; skin parched and tense; dejections either copious and\r\nthin, or bilious and fatty. On the fourteenth, all the symptoms were\r\nexacerbated; he became delirious, and talked much incoherently. On the\r\ntwentieth, wild delirium, jactitation, passed no urine; small drinks\r\nwere retained. On the twenty-fourth he died. Phrenitis.[743]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\nThis treatise opens with a description of the bones of the head,\r\nwhich, although in most respects pretty accurate, is remarkable for\r\ncontaining an account of particular configurations of the cranium,\r\nand of certain varieties in the arrangement of the sutures, which it\r\nhas puzzled modern authorities in anatomy to explain, otherwise than\r\nupon the supposition that the writer must have been but imperfectly\r\nacquainted with the subject. But as the work otherwise bears evidence\r\nthat our author must have examined the bones of the head very\r\ncarefully, and moreover, as in all his works he displays a wonderfully\r\nminute acquaintance with osteology, (to say nothing of the historical\r\ntradition, mentioned by Pausanias, that he was possessed of a skeleton,\r\nwhich at his death he bequeathed to the Temple of Apollo, at Delphi,)\r\nit seems incredible that he should have committed most glaring blunders\r\nin describing the prominent features of a part to which it is clear\r\nthat he had paid very great attention. Moreover, the reputation of\r\nHippocrates for accuracy stood so high, that an eminent authority\r\ndoes not hesitate to declare of him, that he was a man who knew not\r\nhow to deceive or be deceived.[744] An easy way of getting rid of\r\nthe difficulty would no doubt be, to adopt the conjecture advanced\r\nby Scaliger,[745] and in part approved of by Riolanus,[746] that the\r\ntreatise had suffered much in early times, from the interpolations of\r\nignorant transcribers; or to hold, with M. Malgaigne, that the whole\r\nwork is to be condemned as spurious. But it would be a dangerous\r\npractice in ancient criticism, to reject as spurious a work which has\r\nsuch unexceptionable evidence in its favor, although it may contain\r\nmatter which appears to us derogatory to the reputation of its author,\r\nand it will be admitted, by any competent judge who examines the\r\narguments by Scaliger, that the proofs which he brings forward of great\r\ninterpolations in this treatise, are generally of a very fanciful\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nOn a point so obscure, and which has puzzled so many eminent\r\nscholars, it is to be feared that I shall not be able to throw much\r\nadditional light, but as, consistently with my general plan, I cannot\r\nwell avoid stating some opinion on the question I shall endeavor to\r\nelucidate it in so far by giving in the first place a brief sketch\r\nof the information supplied by all the other ancient authorities who\r\nhave touched upon this subject. I shall begin, then, with Aristotle,\r\nthe contemporary of our author, who, in his work “On the History of\r\nAnimals,” gives the following very inaccurate description of the\r\nsutures of the human skull: “The female cranium has one circular\r\nsuture, but men generally three, which unite in one point. But a male\r\nskull has been seen not having a suture.”[747] Celsus describes the\r\nsutures in the following terms: “Ex ceteris, quo suturæ pauciores\r\nsunt, eo capitis valetudo commodior est. Neque enim certus eorum\r\nnumerus est, sicut ne locus quidem. Ferè tamen duæ, super aures,\r\ntempora a superiori parte discernunt; tertia ad aures, occipitium a\r\nsummo capite deducit; quarta, ab eodem vertice per medium caput ad\r\nfrontem procedit; eaque modo sub imo capillo desinit, modo frontem\r\nipsam secans inter supercilia finitur.” (viii., 1.) “Nam neque utique\r\ncerta sedes, supra posui, suturarum est.” (viii., 4.) Pliny gives\r\nthe following description of the head, which it is impossible not to\r\nrecognize as having been borrowed from our author: “Vertices bini\r\nhominum tantum aliquibus. Capitis ossa plana, tenuia, sine medullis,\r\nserratis pectinatim structa compagibus.”[748] Of Ruffus Ephesius I may\r\njust mention, that his descriptions of the human body are in general\r\nremarkable for their correctness, which is not to be wondered at, as he\r\nwould appear to have followed, in general, Erasistratus and the other\r\nauthorities belonging to the great Alexandrian period in anatomy; and\r\nthat he has described very accurately all the sutures of the human\r\ncranium, but says not a word of the different configurations of the\r\nhead, as here given by our author.[749] We now come to Galen, who gives\r\na very lengthy description of the various forms of the head, in nearly\r\nthe same terms as our author, and after alluding to the uses of the\r\nsutures, the principal of which he holds to be to permit transpiration\r\nfrom the brain, he proceeds thus to describe the distribution of the\r\nsutures: “That there is one which runs straight along the middle of the\r\nhead, (the sagittal?) and two transverse, (the coronal and lambdoid?)\r\nhas been stated previously, and need not require many words in this\r\nplace. For, the head being like an oblong sphere, one was justly\r\nmade to extend straight through its middle from behind forwards, and\r\ntwo transverse sutures meet it, and the form of the three sutures is\r\nlike the letter H. For the whole head being more elongated in this\r\ncase than usual, and, as it were, compressed towards the ears, it\r\nwas equitable that the number of the sutures should be unequal as to\r\nlength and breadth, otherwise Nature would undeservedly have been\r\nnamed just, by Hippocrates, in thus giving equal gifts to the unequal.\r\nBut it is not the case; for being most just, she formed the strongest\r\nsuture which extends along the length of the head single, being thus\r\nproportionate to the width of the parts on both sides of it; namely,\r\non the right and on the left; but she formed the transverse double in\r\nnumber, the one behind, as formerly said, called the lambdoid, and\r\nthe other before, called the coronal, so that the bone of the head\r\nbetween these two sutures might be equal to those in the middle, on\r\neach side (the parietal bones?). The sutures of the head, in that\r\nconfiguration which is acuminated,[750] furnish a very great example of\r\nthe justness of Nature. For there are three principal figures of the\r\nhead: the one entirely opposed to the natural configuration already\r\ndescribed, when the head loses both its protuberances, that behind and\r\nthe other before, and is equal on all hands, and like a true sphere;\r\nand two others, the one form having no protuberance in front, and the\r\nother none in the occiput. The sutures of the spherical head are like\r\nthe letter χ, two only in number, and intersecting one another; the\r\none extending transverse from the one ear to the other, and the other\r\nextending straight through the middle of the vertex to the middle\r\nof the forehead. For, as when one part of the head is excessive,\r\nbeing longer than the other, it was just that the longer form should\r\nhave more sutures, so, when both are alike, Nature bestowed an equal\r\nnumber on both. But in the head which wants the protuberance at the\r\nocciput, the straight and the coronal sutures remain, but the lambdoid\r\nis wanting (it being near to the protuberance that is wanting), so\r\nthat the figure of the two resembles the letter T; as also when the\r\nprotuberance of the head in front is wanting, the coronal at the same\r\ntime is wanting, but there remains the one running lengthways and\r\njoining the lambdoid, and this form of construction is made to resemble\r\nthe letter T. A fourth species of acuminated (sugar-loaf) head might\r\nbe imagined, but which does not occur, with the head more prominent at\r\nthe two ears than in front and behind.” He goes on to state the reasons\r\nwhy there is no such construction of the head as this, and concludes as\r\nfollows: “Wherefore Hippocrates described four configurations, and the\r\nsutures of each, in the manner we have now said that they exist, being\r\njustly distributed to each configuration by Nature as to position and\r\nnumber.”[751] The description of the bones and sutures of the head,\r\ngiven in the Latin work “De Ossibus,” generally attributed to Galen, is\r\nto the same effect. The same number of distinct configurations of the\r\nhead, and the same characters as regards the sutures, is also given by\r\nAvicenna, who professedly copies from Galen. (I., i., 5, 3.)\r\n\r\nWhen examined together, these descriptions certainly must be admitted\r\nto have the appearance of being all derived from one original,\r\nnamely, from our author, in this place; and taken literally, there\r\ncan be no doubt that their meaning amounts to this: that the number\r\nof the sutures varies with the form of the head; that when there are\r\nprotuberances both before and behind, the head in its upper part has\r\ntwo transverse sutures, namely, the coronal and the lambdoid, and one\r\nlongitudinal, namely, the sagittal; that if the anterior protuberance\r\nbe wanting, the coronal is wanting, and, if the posterior, the\r\nlambdoid. Now I need scarcely remark, that modern anatomists do not\r\nrecognize such varieties in the configuration of the head nor in the\r\nnumbers of the sutures, and that it is very rare indeed for either the\r\ncoronal or the lambdoid suture to be found wanting. To all appearance,\r\nthen, Galen was mistaken, and it only appears remarkable that, with all\r\nhis knowledge of anatomy, theoretical and practical, and considering\r\nthe opportunities which he must have possessed of examining human\r\nskeletons in Alexandria, he should have failed to observe and describe\r\nthe bones of the cranium for himself.\r\n\r\nBefore stating my own conjectures on this question, it may be\r\ninteresting to examine the solution of it attempted by authorities\r\nwho lived about the period when the original study of human anatomy\r\nwas revived in modern times. In the first place, then, I may mention\r\nthat Ambrose Paré, who, I need scarcely say, was possessed of no mean\r\ntalent for original observation, in treating of fractures of the\r\nhead, adopts exactly the description given by Hippocrates; thus he\r\ndescribes “the bunches of the head” in nearly the same terms as our\r\nauthor, and adds, that such “bunches change the figure and site of\r\nthe sutures,” and that “there be some skulls that want the foremost\r\nsuture, and other some the hind, and sometimes none of the true\r\nsutures, but only the false, _or_ spurious, remain.”[752] Nay,\r\nit. cannot but appear remarkable, that Vesalius, the great antagonist\r\nof Galen and of the ancient authorities in general, in the present\r\ninstance does not venture to call in question their opinion, but gives\r\na description of the different forms of the head, and the varieties\r\nof the sutures, which scarcely at all differs from that given by\r\nHippocrates.[753] It is singular, also, that certain other authorities,\r\nwho were much more disposed to show a leaning to antiquity, such as\r\nColumbus, Eustachius, Fallopius, and Riolanus, should, in the present\r\ninstance, have manifested a more independent spirit in challenging\r\nthe authority of Hippocrates, though, at the same time, they show a\r\ndisposition to find out some mode of bringing him clear off. Thus, for\r\nexample, Riolanus is compelled to admit that there is no such variety\r\nin the forms and numbers of the sutures as Hippocrates describes;\r\nbut he attempts to free him from error, by suggesting that the cases\r\nin which Hippocrates found them wanting must have been those of old\r\nmen.[754] He also quotes some very extraordinary instances, in which\r\nsomething approaching the varieties described by our author had been\r\nremarked.[755] Fallopius does not hesitate, in his great anatomical\r\nwork, to express the surprise he felt that all the authorities should\r\nhave assented to the descriptions of the protuberances and sutures\r\nof the head given by Hippocrates; for that he, after having examined\r\nlarge heaps of crania in the Musea of Ferrara and Florence, had not\r\nfound that they agreed with the descriptions given by Hippocrates;\r\nthat he had seen crania without a suture, and yet not wanting in the\r\nprotuberances; and in like manner, that he had seen the coronal suture\r\nobliterated, and yet the skull possessed its anterior prominence,\r\nand the lambdoid wanting, although the posterior protuberance was as\r\nusual. Altogether, then, in this work he modestly ventures to impugn\r\nthe authority of Hippocrates.[756] In his work entitled “Expositio in\r\nLibrum Galeni de Ossibus,” he adopts the same views, and there declares\r\nthat he had never seen the sutures obliterated except from old age.\r\nBut, in his work entitled “Expositio in Lib. Hippocrat. de Vulneribus\r\nCapitis,” he gives two suppositions, which he had devised in order to\r\ndefend the authority of Hippocrates: first, that Hippocrates did not\r\ngive these varieties of form as real, but as hypothetical; and second,\r\nthat he merely described them as being the vulgar opinion, without\r\npledging himself to the correctness of the description. These, as far\r\nas I am aware, are the only defences which have ever been set up for\r\nour author in this matter, and it must be admitted that they are not\r\nvery satisfactory. I shall now present the reader with the conjectural\r\nexplanation which has occurred to myself. I have imagined that what\r\nHippocrates meant was to express himself to the following effect:\r\nwhen the forehead is remarkably prominent, and, at the same time,\r\nthere is a great depression behind, the cranium, if looked upon from\r\nabove, will show the coronal suture running across the fore part of\r\nthe head, and the sagittal through its middle, while the lambdoid will\r\nbe inconspicuous, from being below the level of the coronal. The two\r\ntogether, then, would form some resemblance to the letter T. When, on\r\nthe other hand, the forehead is low, that is to say, wants its normal\r\ndevelopment, and the occiput is unusually prominent, the lambdoid\r\nsuture joins the sagittal, so as to present some appearance of the same\r\nletter reversed. But in a square-built head, where the frontal and\r\noccipital regions have protuberances equally developed, the coronal and\r\nlambdoid sutures run nearly parallel to one another, and are joined\r\nin the middle by the sagittal, in which case the three sutures may be\r\nimagined to present some resemblance to the Greek letter Η. When there\r\nis no protuberance either before or behind, and the sagittal suture\r\npasses through the middle of the bone down to the nasal process, the\r\ncoronal suture intersects it, so as to give them something like the\r\nshape of the Greek letter χ.[757] I offer this explanation, however,\r\nmerely as a conjecture, and wish the reader to judge of it accordingly.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to give an analysis of the contents of this treatise, and\r\nto attempt to form a correct estimate of their value.\r\n\r\nInjuries of the cranial bones are divided by our author into five\r\norders, as follows: 1, simple fractures, _or_ fissures of various kinds\r\nand sizes (§ 4); 2, contusion, without fracture or depression (§ 5);\r\n3, fractures attended with depression (§ 6); 4, the _hedra_, that is\r\nto say, the indentation or cut in the outer table of the bone, and not\r\nnecessarily attended either with fracture or contusion (§ 7); 5, the\r\ncounter-fissure, or _fracture par contre-coup_ fracture and the severe\r\ncontusion, require the operation of trepanning; whereas neither the\r\n_hedra_ (_or_ simple cut) nor the depressed fracture require it, and\r\nthe counter-fissure does not admit it, owing to the obscurity of the\r\nsymptoms with which it is attended (§ 9).\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the surgeon is to ascertain the nature and\r\nsituation of the wound, by a careful investigation of all the\r\ncircumstances of the case, but so as to avoid the use of the sound, if\r\npossible (§§ 9, 10).\r\n\r\nNext are described the various kind of injury which the different sorts\r\nof weapons are most likely to inflict, and from the consideration of\r\nthem the surgeon is to form an estimate of the probable nature of the\r\naccident (§ 11).\r\n\r\nThe characters of the _hedra_, or superficial injury of the\r\ncranium, and the difficulty of forming a correct estimate of it, when\r\ncomplicated by the presence of a suture, are strongly insisted upon (§\r\n12).\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which the treatment of injuries situated in\r\ndifferent parts of the head should be treated, are carefully defined\r\nand stated. Great, and as now would be thought, superfluous directions\r\nare given, for ascertaining whether or not a fissure exists in the\r\nbone. The treatment, as far as applications go, is to be mild and\r\ndesiccant. When a fracture cannot be made to disappear by scraping, the\r\ntrepan is to be applied (§§ 13, 14).\r\n\r\nThe dangers which the bone incurs of becoming affected from the soft\r\nparts, are strongly insisted upon, and applications of a drying nature\r\nare prescribed (§ 15).\r\n\r\nThe condition of a piece of bone which is going to exfoliate is\r\ncorrectly and strikingly described (§ 16).\r\n\r\nThe treatment of depression is laid down, and the danger of applying\r\nthe trepan in this case is strongly insisted upon (§ 17).\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities in the case of children are pointed out. Under\r\ncertain circumstances, when there is contusion combined with the\r\nfracture, he admits of perforating the skull with a small trepan (§ 18).\r\n\r\nWhen, after a severe injury, symptoms of irritation and inflammation\r\nappear to be coming on, the surgeon is to lose no time in proceeding to\r\nthe operation. Some correct observations are made on the consequences\r\nof injuries of the head on other parts of the body (§ 19).\r\n\r\nThe treatment of erysipelatous inflammation is distinctly laid down\r\n(§20).\r\n\r\nThe operation of trepanning the skull is circumstantially described,\r\nand an interesting description is given of a mode of doing the\r\noperation peculiar to our author[758] (§ 21).\r\n\r\nThis, then, as far as I know, is the first exposition ever made of a\r\nhighly important subject in surgery, upon which professional men are\r\nstill greatly divided in opinion. I cannot, then, resist the temptation\r\nto offer some remarks on the views of practice here recommended, and to\r\ninstitute a comparison between them and certain methods of treatment\r\nwhich have been in vogue of late years.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely doubt but it will be generally admitted that the\r\nexposition of the subject here given is remarkably lucid, that\r\nour author’s divisions of it are strongly marked, and his rules\r\nof practice, whether correct or not, distinctly laid down. At all\r\nevents, it will not be affirmed that there is any confusion in his\r\nideas, or that his principles of treatment are not properly defined.\r\nAfter all that has been written on injuries of the head, it would be\r\ndifficult to point to any better arrangement of them than that of our\r\nauthor, into five orders: 1st, simple fractures without depression;\r\n2d, contusions without fracture or depression; 3d, depression with\r\nfracture; 4th, simple incisions without fracture; 5th, fractures _par\r\ncontre-coup_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the operation of trepanning the skull, then, our author’s\r\nrule of practice is sufficiently well defined: we are to operate in\r\nthe first two of these cases, that is to say, in simple fractures and\r\ncontusions, but not in the last three, that is to say, in fracture\r\nwith depression, in simple incisions in the skull, and in the\r\ncounter-fissure. To begin, then, with the examination of those cases in\r\nwhich the operation is proscribed: it is not to be had recourse to in\r\nthe counter-fissure, because, from the nature of it, there is generally\r\nno rule by which its existence can be positively ascertained, and\r\ntherefore the case is to be given up as hopeless.\r\n\r\nIn the simple incision of the bone, that is to say, in the slash or\r\nindentation, when the effects of the injury are not transmitted to the\r\nbrain, it must be obvious that all instrumental interference must be\r\nstrongly contraindicated.[759]\r\n\r\nAt first sight it will appear remarkable to a surgeon, who approaches\r\nthe subject with views exclusively modern, that our author should have\r\ninterdicted the use of instruments in that class of injuries in which\r\none would be inclined to suppose that they are most clearly indicated,\r\nnamely, in a fracture of considerable extent, attended with depression\r\nof part of the bone from its natural level. Several questions present\r\nthemselves here to be solved. Is the operation generally required? Has\r\nit been successful when it has been had recourse to? When it is to be\r\nperformed, should it be done immediately, or not until the bad effects\r\nof the injury have manifested themselves?\r\n\r\nWith regard, then, to the necessity of the operation for depressed\r\nfractures, the most discordant opinions have prevailed in modern times,\r\nand even within a very recent period. Not to go farther back than\r\nPott, it is well known that he established it as the general rule of\r\npractice, that in every case of fracture with depression, the skull\r\nshould be perforated, and the depressed portion of the bone either\r\nraised to its level, or entirely removed. But since his time a great\r\nchange of opinion has taken place on this subject, and of late it\r\nhas become the general rule of practice (if rule can be predicated,\r\nwhere opinions are so vague and indeterminate) not to interfere, even\r\nin cases of depression, unless urgent symptoms have supervened. The\r\nlate Mr. Abernethy took the lead in questioning the propriety of the\r\nrule laid down by Pott; and with the view of demonstrating that the\r\noperation may be often dispensed with in fractures complicated with\r\ndepression, and in order, as he says, “to counteract in some degree\r\nthe bias which long-accustomed modes of thinking and acting are apt to\r\nimpress on the minds of practitioners,” he relates the histories of\r\nfive cases of fracture with depression, which, in the space of twelve\r\nmonths, occurred under his own eyes in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, and\r\nwhich all terminated favorably, although no operation was performed.\r\nThese cases, supported by the authority of so great a name as Mr.\r\nAbernethy, made a deep impression on the profession, especially in\r\nthis country, so that it became the established rule of practice in\r\nBritish surgery never to interfere in cases of fracture, unless with\r\nthe view of removing urgent symptoms. See Cooper’s Surgical Dictionary,\r\nedit. 1825, and the previous edition. The old Hippocratic rule in\r\nregard to the trepan, when it is at all to be applied, namely, that\r\nof applying it as a preventive of bad consequences, was altogether\r\neschewed, and it was held to be perfectly unwarrantable to perforate\r\nthe skull, except with the intention of removing substances which were\r\ncreating irritation and pressure of the brain. This practice, I say,\r\nwas sanctioned by all the best army and hospital surgeons, from about\r\nthe beginning of the present century, down to a very recent period.\r\nWhat, then, it will be asked, have been the results? Has experience\r\nconfirmed the safety of this rule of practice, or has it not? To enable\r\nus to solve these queries, we have most elaborate and trustworthy\r\nstatistics, published a few years ago by Dr. Laurie of Glasgow, which\r\ndeserve to be seriously studied by every surgeon who may be called\r\nupon to discharge the duties of his profession in such cases. I cannot\r\nfind room for long extracts from these valuable papers, but may be\r\nallowed to state a few of the more important results which are to be\r\ndeduced from Dr. Laurie’s interesting investigation. Coming then at\r\nonce to the point, it deserves to be remarked that Dr. Laurie’s ample\r\nexperience has led him to reject decidedly the rule of practice,\r\nwhich, as I have stated, was established by Mr. Abernethy, about\r\nforty years ago, namely, that, in cases of depression, the symptoms\r\nof compression should be our guide to the employment of the trephine.\r\nHe adds, “however well this rule may sound, when delivered _ex\r\ncathedrá_, it will be found of very little practical utility, for\r\nthis reason, that if we limit interference to cases exhibiting symptoms\r\nof compression, we had much better not interfere at all, inasmuch as\r\nsuch cases prove almost invariably fatal. Such, at least, has been\r\nthe experience of the Glasgow hospitals; for out of fifty-six cases\r\noperated upon, including, in point of time, a period little short of\r\nfifty years, there does not appear in our records a single unequivocal\r\ninstance of profound insensibility, in which the mere operation of\r\ntrepanning removed the coma and paralysis, or in any way conduced\r\nto the recovery of the patient. We wish to be clearly understood as\r\nspeaking of the trephine used in reference to the state of the bone in\r\ncases of profound insensibility, not employed to remove extravasated\r\nblood. Nor does the cause of our want of success appear at all obscure.\r\nWe believe that in practice the cases of urgent compression dependent\r\non depressed bone alone are very few indeed; we are well aware that\r\nmany such are on record, we do not presume to impugn their accuracy, we\r\nmerely affirm that the records of the Glasgow Infirmary do not add to\r\nthe number.” He thus states his views with regard to the principles by\r\nwhich the application of the trephine should be regulated. “From what\r\nwe have said, it will appear that we coincide with these who, in using\r\nthe trephine, in cases of compound fracture of the skull, look more to\r\nthe state of the bone than to the general symptoms, and _who employ\r\nit more as a preventive of inflammation and its consequences, than as\r\na cure for urgent symptoms, the immediate result of the accident_.”\r\nHe goes on to state that “the details we have given are by no means\r\nin favor of the trephine. Of fifty-six cases operated upon, eleven\r\nrecovered, and forty-five died. We feel assured that this affords too\r\nfavorable a view of the actual results.”[760]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the extracts now given, it will readily be seen that this very\r\nable authority has rejected entirely the rule of practice established\r\nby Mr. Abernethy, and that, in so far, he has reverted to the principle\r\nupon which the use of the instruments in simple fractures of the\r\nskull was regulated by Hippocrates, namely, as a preventive of the\r\nbad consequences of fracture on the brain, rather than with the view\r\nof relieving them when established. It will further be seen that, in\r\nwhatever way applied, the use of perforating instruments in the case of\r\ndepressed fractures is attended with so unsatisfactory results, that\r\nit may be doubted if any other operation in surgery, recognized as\r\nlegitimate, be equally fatal.[761] Less than one fifth of the patients\r\noperated upon recovered. In fact, he very candidly admits “that it\r\nwould not have been greatly to the disadvantage of the patients\r\nadmitted into the Glasgow Infirmary, if the trephine had never found\r\nits way within its walls.” He further, in conclusion, adverts to the\r\nwell-known fact that Desault, in the end, completely abandoned the\r\noperation, and that Mr. Lawrence states, “as far as the experience of\r\nthis Hospital (St. Bartholomew’s) goes, he can cite very few instances\r\nin which the life of the patient had been saved by the operation of\r\ntrephining.”[762]\r\n\r\nAltogether, then, it will be allowed to no very questionable\r\nwhether, in general, the Hippocratic treatment, in cases of fracture\r\nwith depression, would not be fully as successful as the modern\r\npractice of perforating the skull. Moreover, it is by no means well\r\nascertained, as generally assumed by superficial observers of facts\r\nin medical practice, that depressed fractures are more dangerous than\r\nother injuries of the skull attended with less formidable appearances.\r\nIndeed, recent experience has shown, in confirmation of the opinion\r\nadvanced by our author, that extensive fractures, with great\r\ndepression, are frequently not followed by any very dangerous train\r\nof consequences. (See Thomson’s “Observations made in the Military\r\nHospitals of Belgium,” pp. 59, 60; Hennen’s “Military Surgery,” p. 287;\r\nCooper’s “Lectures,” xiii.; Mr. Guthrie’s “Lectures on Injuries of the\r\nHead,” p. 56.) All these, in substance, coincide with Mr. Guthrie, who\r\nmentions with approbation that “it has been stated from the earliest\r\nantiquity, that the greater the fracture, the less the concussion\r\nof the brain.” I may mention further, that I myself, in the course\r\nof my own experience, have known many instances in which fractures\r\nwith considerable depression were not followed, either immediately\r\nor afterwards, by any bad consequences; while, on the other hand,\r\nI have known cases in which simple contusion of the bone, without\r\nfracture or extravasation, and without even very urgent symptoms of\r\nconcussion at first, have proved fatal in the course of a day or two.\r\nNow, in such circumstances, Hippocrates would have operated by either\r\nperforating the skull at once, down to the meninx, and removing a\r\npiece of it, or by sawing it nearly through, and leaving the piece of\r\nbone to exfoliate. It will be asked here, what object can he have had\r\nin view by this procedure? This he has nowhere distinctly defined;\r\nbut, judging from the whole tenor of this treatise, and that of his\r\ncommentator, Galen, I can have no doubt in my mind that what he wished\r\nto accomplish was to loosen the bones of the head, and give greater\r\nroom to the brain, which he conceived to be in a state of congestion\r\nand swelling brought on by the vibration, or _trémoussement_,\r\ncommunicated directly to the brain by the contusion. It is, in fact, an\r\nopinion which Hippocrates repeatedly inculcates, not only with regard\r\nto the brain, but also respecting injuries of the chest and joints,\r\nthat severe contusions are, in general, more dangerous than fractures,\r\nthe effects of the vibration in the former case being more violent than\r\nin the latter.[763] Believing, then, that, in contusions, the internal\r\nstructure of the brain is extensively injured, and that irritation,\r\nwith hypertrophy, are the consequences, he advocated instrumental\r\ninterference, in order as I have stated, to give more room to the\r\nbrain, and relieve it from its state of compression.[764] This, no\r\ndoubt, was the rationale of his practice also in simple fractures, not\r\nattended with depression, that is to say, his object in perforating the\r\nskull was to remove tension, and furnish an outlet to the collection\r\nwithin, whether of a liquid or a gaseous nature.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that our author also had it in view, by\r\nperforating the skull, to afford an issue to extravasated blood and\r\nother matters collected within the cranium. This clearly appears\r\nfrom what is stated in section 18, and the same rule of practice is\r\ndistinctly described by Celsus in the following terms: “Raro, sed\r\naliquando tamen evenit, ut os quidem totum integrum maneat, intus\r\nvero ex ictu vena aliqua in cerebri membrana rupta aliquid sanguinis\r\nmittat; isque ibi concretus magnos dolores moveat, et oculos quibusdam\r\nobcæcet.... Sed ferè contra id dolor est, et, eo loco cute incisa,\r\npallidum os reperitur: ideoque id os quoque excidendum est.” (viii.,\r\n4.) It is quite certain, then, that one of the objects for which our\r\nauthor recommended trepanning, was to give issue to extravasated blood\r\non the surface of the skull. This naturally leads me to compare the\r\nresults of modern experience in the treatment of cases of contusion,\r\nwith or without extravasation of blood.\r\n\r\nAll the earlier of our modern authorities on surgery, such as\r\nTheodoric, Pet. c. Largelata, Ambrose Paré, Wiseman, and Fallopius,\r\ndistinctly held that contusions of the skull, even when not complicated\r\nwith a fracture, are often of so formidable a nature as to require\r\nthe use of perforating instruments. The same views are strenuously\r\nadvocated by Pott, who has described the effects of contusion in very\r\nelegant and impressive language. See page 42; ed. Lond. 1780. The\r\nupshot is, that one of the consequences of a severe contusion of the\r\nbone frequently is separation of the pericranium, “which is almost\r\nalways followed by a separation between the cranium and the dura\r\nmater; a circumstance extremely well worth attending to in fissures\r\nand undepressed fractures of the skull, because it is from this\r\ncircumstance principally that the bad symptoms and the hazard in such\r\ncases arise.” (p. 50.)[765] After insisting, in very strong terms, on\r\nthe danger attending severe contusions of the, skull, he proceeds to\r\nlay down the rules of treatment, which, in a word, are comprehended\r\nin the two following intentions:--first, to prevent bad consequences\r\nby having recourse, at first, to depletion; and, second, to procure\r\nthe discharge of matter collected under the cranium, which can be\r\nanswered only by the perforation of it. He agrees with Archigenes that\r\nthe operation is generally too long deferred, and that the sooner it\r\nis performed the better. Still, however, it is to be borne in mind\r\nthat even Potts does not make it a general rule to operate at first,\r\n_before_ the bad symptoms have come on, that is to say, during the\r\nfirst three days, and that he rather appears to have followed Celsus,\r\nwho alludes to the method of Hippocrates, and describes his rule of\r\npractice in the following terms:\r\n\r\n--“In omni vero fisso fractoque osse, protinus antiquiores medici\r\nad ferramenta veniebant, quibus id exciderent. Sed multo melius est\r\nante emplastra experiri, etc.... Si vero sub prima curatione febris\r\nintenditur, ... magni dolores sunt, cibique super hæc fastidium\r\nincreseit; tum demum ad manum scalprumque veniendum est.” (viii., 4.)\r\nPott then, it appears, follows the rule of Celsus, and does not operate\r\nuntil unpleasant effects have developed themselves;[766] but, at the\r\nsame time, he candidly admits that, although the course now described\r\nbe all that our art is capable of doing in these melancholy cases,\r\nhe wishes he could say that it was frequently successful. He then\r\ngoes on to relate several cases: first, of simple contusion without\r\na wound; second, of contusion with a wound; and, third, of contusion\r\nwith extravasation. In all these classes of cases he operated with\r\nvery equivocal results; but then it is to be borne in mind, that, as\r\nI have said, he operated, like Celsus, after the bad effects had come\r\non, and not, like Hippocrates, at first, in order to prevent them.\r\nEven with all these discouraging results, he continued to adhere to\r\nthis rule of treatment, which, under the sanction of his name, became\r\nthe established practice of the profession. The late Mr. Abernethy,\r\nwho took the lead in innovating upon Pott’s rules for the application\r\nof the trephine, did not venture to make any material change in this\r\ncase when he supposed that there was any considerable extravasation of\r\nblood; and he delivered it as a test whereby we might judge whether\r\nor not a great vessel had been ruptured within the skull, to examine\r\nwhether or no the bone bled, having generally found, as, indeed, had\r\nbeen clearly laid down by Celsus, that in these cases the bone does\r\nnot bleed. The rule of practice, then, to operate in order to remove\r\nthe coagula of blood and matters which form between the skull and the\r\ndura mater, was sanctioned by Sir Charles Bell and Sir Astley Cooper;\r\nbut they, like Mr. Abernethy, generally condemn interference when the\r\nfluids are situated below the membrane. On this subject Mr. Guthrie\r\nremarks:--“The operation of incising the dura mater, to admit of the\r\ndischarge of blood or matter from beneath, and even of puncturing\r\nthe brain, is much more commonly performed in France than in Great\r\nBritain, where it is very rarely had recourse to, _and which may be\r\nan error_,” etc. (p. 125.)\r\n\r\nAfter thirty years’ further experience, this practice has been\r\ntested by the recent statistics of Dr. Laurie, and the results, as\r\nstated by him, are very discouraging. In the Hospital of Glasgow,\r\nit was found in practice that there was no certain symptom whereby\r\nit could be determined at what part of the head the blood had been\r\neffused, nor, when discovered, could it, in general, be removed by\r\ntrephining the skull. The results, in short, were the following: “We\r\nhave thus thirty-nine cases in which extravasation existed as the\r\nprincipal lesion, or as an important complication, in only one of which\r\nextravasation existed as the principal lesion, or as an important\r\ncomplication; in only one of which could an operation have saved the\r\npatient; and of the seventeen cases operated upon, _not one_\r\nrecovered after, or was benefited by, the removal of the coagula.”\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the results of modern experience, as far as they\r\nare at present ascertained, in the use of the trephine for the\r\ntreatment of contusion, and undepressed fracture, complicated with\r\nthe effusion either of blood or of matter, from the days of Pott down\r\nto the present time. The reader, however, should bear in remembrance\r\nthat the practice, of which the results have been shown to be so\r\nunsatisfactory, is not that of Hippocrates, but of Celsus; for, in the\r\npresent instance, even Dr. Laurie repudiates the idea of operating\r\n“for the purpose of relieving the evil consequences _which may\r\nfollow_ concussion of the brain,” and holds distinctly in this case\r\nthat one is not warranted in even entertaining the idea of operating,\r\nunless--“first, when the puffy tumor indicates the spot which probably\r\nhas sustained the greatest amount of injury; second, such an inflamed\r\nand suppurating condition of the injured soft parts as renders it more\r\nthan probable that the corresponding portion of the dura mater is in\r\na similarly diseased condition; third, inflammatory fever, preceded\r\nor followed by rigors, and symptoms of compression.” From what has\r\nbeen stated, then, it must appear evident that the recent statistics\r\nfurnish no test whatever of the results of the practice laid down by\r\nHippocrates, which was founded upon an entirely different principle,\r\nnamely, the preventive.\r\n\r\nBut, however anxious I may feel to prosecute further this comparison\r\nof the results of ancient and of modern experience on this highly\r\ninteresting subject, my necessary limits compel me to bring this\r\ndiscussion to a close. Before doing so, however, I shall briefly state\r\nthe inferences which I think may be drawn from a careful study of all\r\nthe principle authorities who have written on injuries of the head from\r\nHippocrates down to the present time:\r\n\r\n1. All the serious injuries of the skull may be arranged conveniently\r\nunder the classes of contusions, simple fractures and fractures with\r\ndepressions.\r\n\r\n2. Hippocrates recommended the operation of perforating the cranium, in\r\ncases of simple fractures and contusions, whenever he apprehended that\r\nthese would be followed by serious consequences, such as inflammation,\r\nextravasation of blood, and the effusion of matter.\r\n\r\n3. Hippocrates operated in these cases during the first three days,\r\nbefore any serious symptoms had come on, but Celsus rejected this\r\nrule, and postponed the operation until after these effects had been\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n4. The objects which Hippocrates had in view by perforating the\r\nskull, either entirely through or nearly so, would appear to have been\r\nto slacken the tightness of the skull, and procure the evacuation of\r\nextravasated blood lying within it.\r\n\r\n5. The object for which Celsus opened the skull would appear to have\r\nbeen solely to remove bodies which were creating irritation in the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n6. All the ancient authorities looked upon contusions and simple\r\nfractures as being very formidable injuries, which generally produce\r\ncongestion in the brain, with inflammation and effusion.\r\n\r\n7. In modern times, at least within the last hundred years, the\r\ntrephine has never been applied in cases of contusion and simple\r\nfracture, upon the principle of the operation acting as a preventive\r\nof subsequent mischief, but only with the object of relieving effusion\r\nwhen it was supposed to have taken place within the cranium, that is to\r\nsay, upon the plan recommended by Celsus.\r\n\r\n8. The most contradictory accounts are given by modern authorities,\r\nespecially by the French surgeons of the eighteenth century, as to the\r\ndifferent results in cases of this description, when let alone, and\r\nwhen treated upon the Celsian principle; and the recent statistics of\r\nthe operation are extremely unfavorable.\r\n\r\n9. Hippocrates regarded fractures accompanied with depression and a\r\nconsiderable separation of the bones as being generally less dangerous\r\nthan severe contusions and simple fractures, as in the former case\r\nthe brain is usually less hurt by the vibration of the shock which\r\ninflicted the injury, and there is an outlet to any noxious matters\r\nwhich may get congested in the brain.\r\n\r\n10. Hippocrates, as a general rule, did not operate in cases of\r\ndepression, not even in cases of comminuted fracture, but in the latter\r\ncase left the pieces of bone to separate gradually by suppuration.\r\n\r\n11. Celsus, on the other hand, approved of removing spiculæ at once,\r\nof raising the depressed corner of a fractured bone, by sawing off the\r\nsuperincumbent part, and even of perforating the adjoining bone, and,\r\nin certain instances, of removing the whole of the depressed portion.\r\n\r\n12. Pott laid it down as a general rule of practice, to operate with\r\nthe trephine in all cases of fracture accompanied with any considerable\r\ndegree of depression, and this formed the established practice in\r\nthis country, until the late Mr. Abernethy, about forty years ago,\r\nintroduced the rule of not interfering in such cases until urgent\r\nsymptoms had come on.\r\n\r\n13. Of late years a further innovation has taken place in this rule\r\nof practice in cases of depressed fracture, the operation being had\r\nrecourse to by Dr. Laurie and others, on the principle of preventing\r\nthe bad effects likely to result from the injury.\r\n\r\n14. On whatever principle applied, the statistics of large hospitals\r\nexhibit the results of the operation in a most unfavorable light,\r\ninsomuch that many of the most able and experienced surgeons of the\r\nday hesitate whether, as a general rule, the operation ought not to be\r\nabandoned altogether.\r\n\r\n_Finally, a careful study of the whole literature of the subject,\r\nfrom Hippocrates down to the present time, leads to the conclusion that\r\nwhat constitutes the great difficulty in the treatment of injuries\r\nof the head is, that the operation, to be successful, would require\r\nto be performed early, and rather with a view of preventing serious\r\nconsequences, than of removing them after they have come on; and that\r\nthese can seldom be estimated so correctly as could be wished, since\r\nthey frequently bear no proportion to the apparent magnitude of the\r\nmischief which the cranium has sustained._[767]\r\n\r\nAs the reader may find some difficulty in apprehending correctly the\r\nnature of the instruments and other apparatus used by the ancients\r\nin surgical operations, I have subjoined drawings of them, taken\r\nprincipally from the works of Vidus Vidius and Andreas à Cruce, who\r\nboth lived at a time when these instruments must have been sufficiently\r\ncommon in the cabinets of learned physicians, so that there is every\r\npresumption that the figures which they give are sufficiently correct.\r\nThe manner in which they were used will readily be comprehended\r\nfrom their shapes, assisted by the following lucid description of\r\nthe ancient process of trepanning the skull, given by Mr. Pott. “If\r\nthe piece of bone intended to be removed was larger than could be\r\ncomprehended within the modiolus (_trephine?_) then in use, and\r\nwhich was a very defective instrument in many respects, the operation\r\nwas thus performed by means of terebræ. The piece intended to be taken\r\naway was surrounded with perforations made at small distances from\r\neach other, and then either the scalper excisorius or the scalper\r\nlenticulatus was introduced, and, by means of repeated strokes with\r\na heavy mallet, was driven through all the interspaces between each\r\nperforation. By these means the portion of bone so surrounded was\r\nremoved, and the dura mater was laid bare.”[768] That the modiolus of\r\nCelsus was a small circular saw with a pivot, exactly like the modern\r\ntrephine, seems quite obvious from his own description of it; and that\r\nthe instrument called by our author terebra serrata (πρίων χαρακτὸς)\r\nwas identical with it, cannot admit of any doubt. See Foës, Œc. Hipp.\r\nin voce πρίων.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I must also say a few words on one important point\r\nconnected with the constitutional treatment, which the modern reader\r\nmay at first sight be surprised to find no mention made of in this\r\ntreatise--I mean the use of venesection in the treatment of injuries of\r\nthe head. Now certainly it does not appear that Hippocrates regarded\r\nbleeding as necessarily forming a portion of the system of treatment\r\nin injuries of the bones of the head any more than in those of other\r\nbones. But, although these were his views, it can be as little doubted,\r\nby any one who is acquainted with his general views of practice, that\r\nhe bled whenever the abstraction of blood was indicated, either to\r\nproduce evacuation or revulsion. We know, for example, that in pains\r\nof the back part of the head he opened the temporal vessels,[769]\r\nand that in all inflammations and febrile diseases he abstracted\r\nblood freely, nay, perhaps, _ad deliquium animi_.[770] And that\r\nHippocrates enforced the depletory system of treatment in injuries\r\nof the head, when pain and inflammatory fever supervened, is quite\r\nobvious, from its having been the system pursued in such cases by all\r\nsubsequent authorities, who looked up to him as their great guide in\r\npractice. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book VI., 90, Syd. Soc. Edit.\r\nI may mention further, as a proof that I am not straining a point\r\nin the present instance, in order, as might be supposed, to bring\r\nmy author clear off in a case where he would appear to have been in\r\nfault, that Ambrose Paré, who is a great advocate for depletion in\r\nthe treatment of fractures of the skull, is at great pains to show\r\nthat he has Hippocrates on his side in support of this practice.[771]\r\nBut while it is maintained that our author did not omit venesection\r\nwhen properly indicated, I did not mean to say that he or any of the\r\nancient authorities carried the abstraction of the blood to the extent\r\npracticed by Pott, or the members of the Royal Academy of Surgery in\r\nFrance, nor as was done by the army and hospital surgeons of this\r\ncountry during the late war.[772] Whether or not this was a defect\r\nin ancient practice I shall not take it upon me to offer an opinion.\r\nSuffice it to say, that there is undoubted evidence that in injuries\r\nof the head the ancient surgeon, as is _naively_ recommended by\r\nAvicenna, “bled his patient when he stood in need of being bled;”[773]\r\nthat is to say, according to special indications, and not in obedience\r\nto any general rule.[774]\r\n\r\nThere is another point of practice in injuries of the head to which\r\nit is proper that I should draw attention--I mean cold applications.\r\nNow it is beyond a doubt that the application of cold in diseases of\r\nthe brain is pointedly condemned by Hippocrates, and that he used hot\r\napplications instead;[775] and, moreover, that most of the ancient\r\nauthorities adhered to his rule on this point. At the same time it\r\nwould appear, that in extreme cases certain of them did not scruple to\r\napply ice to the shaved head.[776] I shall only remark further, that in\r\nthis case, as in diseases of the eyes, perhaps the safest rule is, to\r\nbe guided very much by the feelings and habits of the patient.\r\n\r\n[The Plates referred to will be found at the end of the work.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ON INJURIES OF THE HEAD\r\n\r\n1. Men’s heads are by no means all like to one another, nor are\r\nthe sutures of the head of all men constructed in the same form.\r\nThus, whoever has a prominence in the anterior part of the head (by\r\nprominence is meant the round protuberant part of the bone which\r\nprojects beyond the rest of it), in him the sutures of the head take\r\nthe form of the Greek letter _tau_, Τ; for the head has the\r\nshorter line running transverse before the prominence, while the other\r\nline runs through the middle of the head, all the way to the neck.[777]\r\nBut whoever has the prominence in the back part of the head, in him the\r\nsutures are constructed in quite the opposite form to the former; for\r\nin this case the shorter line runs in front of the prominence, while\r\nthe longer runs through the middle all along to the forehead.[778] But\r\nwhoever has a prominence of the head both before and behind, in him\r\nthe sutures resemble the Greek letter _êta_ Η; for the long lines\r\nof the letter run transverse before each prominence while the short\r\none runs through the middle and terminates in the long lines.[779] But\r\nwhoever has no prominence on either part he has the sutures of the head\r\nresembling the Greek letter χ; for the one line comes transverse to the\r\ntemple while the other passes along the middle of the head.[780] The\r\nbone at the middle of the head is double, the hardest and most compact\r\npart being the upper portion, where it is connected with the skin,\r\nand the lowest, where it is connected with the meninx (dura mater);\r\nand from the uppermost and lowermost parts the bone gradually becomes\r\nsofter and less compact, till you come to the _diploe_.[781] The\r\ndiploe is the most porous, the softest, and most cavernous part. But\r\nthe whole bone of the head, with the exception of a small portion of\r\nthe uppermost and lowermost portions of it, is like a sponge; and the\r\nbone has in it many juicy substances, like caruncles; and if one will\r\nrub them with the fingers, some blood will issue from them.[782] There\r\nare also in the bone certain very slender and hollow vessels full of\r\nblood. So it is with regard to hardness, softness, and porosity.\r\n\r\n2. In respect to thickness and thinness; the thinnest and weakest part\r\nof the whole head is the part about the bregma; and the bone there has\r\nthe smallest and thinnest covering of flesh upon it, and the largest\r\nproportion of brain is situated in that region of the head. And hence\r\nit happens that from similar or even smaller wounds and instruments,\r\nwhen a person is wounded to the same or a less degree, the bone of\r\nthe head there is more contused, fractured, and depressed; and that\r\ninjuries there are more deadly and more difficult to cure; and it is\r\nmore difficult to save one’s life in injuries there than in any other\r\npart of the head; that from having sustained a similar or even a less\r\nwound a man will die, and that, too, in a shorter space of time than\r\nfrom a wound in any other part of the head. For the brain about the\r\nbregma feels more quickly and strongly any mischief that may occur to\r\nthe flesh or the bone; for the brain about the bregma is in largest\r\nquantity, and is covered by the thinnest bone and the least flesh. Of\r\nthe other portions, the weakest is that about the temples; for it is\r\nthe conjunction of the lower jaw with the cranium, and there is motion\r\nthere up and down as at a joint; and the organ of hearing is near it;\r\nand further, a hollow and important vein runs along the temple. But\r\nthe whole bone of the head behind the vertex and the ear is stronger\r\nthan the whole anterior part, and the bone itself has a larger and\r\ndeeper covering of flesh upon it. And hence it follows, that when\r\nexposed to the same or even greater injuries from instruments of the\r\nsame or greater size, the bone is less liable to be fractured and\r\ndepressed than elsewhere; and that in a fatal accident the patient will\r\nlive longer when the wound is in the posterior part of the head than\r\nwhen elsewhere; and that pus takes longer time to form and penetrate\r\nthrough the bone to the brain, owing to the thickness of the bone; and\r\nmoreover, as there is less brain in that part of the head, more persons\r\nwho are wounded in the back part of the head escape than of those who\r\nare wounded in the anterior part.[783] And in fatal cases, a man will\r\nsurvive longer in winter than in summer, whatever be the part of the\r\nhead in which the wound is situated.\r\n\r\n3. As to the _hædræ_ (dints _or_ marks?) of sharp and light\r\nweapons, when they take place in the bone without fissure, contusion,\r\nor depression inwards (and these take place equally in the anterior\r\nand posterior part of the head), death, when it does occur, does not\r\nproperly result from them. A suture appearing in a wound, when the\r\nbone is laid bare, on whatever part of the head the wound may have\r\nbeen inflicted, is the weakest point of the head to resist a blow or a\r\nweapon, when the weapon happens to be impinged into the suture itself;\r\nbut more especially when this occurs in the bregma at the weakest part\r\nof the head, and the sutures happen to be situated near the wound, and\r\nthe weapon has hit the sutures themselves.[784]\r\n\r\n4. The bone in the head is liable to be wounded in the following\r\nmodes, and there are many varieties in each of these modes of fracture:\r\nWhen a wounded bone breaks, in the bone comprehending the fissure,\r\ncontusion necessarily takes place where the bone is broken; for an\r\ninstrument that breaks the bone occasions a contusion thereof more or\r\nless, both at the fracture and in the parts of the bone surrounding\r\nthe fracture.[785] This is the first mode. But there are all possible\r\nvarieties of fissures; for some of them are fine, and so very fine that\r\nthey cannot be discovered, either immediately after the injury, or\r\nduring the period in which it would be of use to the patient if this\r\ncould be ascertained. And some of these fissures are thicker and wider,\r\ncertain of them being very wide. And some of them extend to a greater,\r\nand some to a smaller, distance. And some are more straight, nay,\r\ncompletely straight; and some are more curved, and that in a remarkable\r\ndegree. And some are deep, so as to extend downwards and through the\r\nwhole bone; and some are less so, and do not penetrate through the\r\nwhole bone.\r\n\r\n5. But a bone may be contused, and yet remain in its natural condition\r\nwithout any fracture in it; this is the second mode. And there are\r\nmany varieties of contusion; for they occur to a greater and less\r\ndegree, and to a greater depth, so as sometimes to extend through the\r\nwhole bone; or to a less depth, so as not to extend through the whole\r\nbone; and to a greater and smaller length and breadth. But it is not\r\npossible to recognize any of these varieties by the sight, so as to\r\ndetermine their form and extent; neither, indeed, is it visible to the\r\neyes when any mischief of this kind takes place, and immediately after\r\nthe injury, whether or not the bone has been actually bruised, as is\r\nlikewise the ease with certain fractures at a distance from the seat of\r\ninjury.[786]\r\n\r\n6. And the bone being fractured, is sometimes depressed inwards from\r\nits natural level along with the fractures, otherwise there would be\r\nno depression; for the depressed portion being fractured and broken\r\noff, is pushed inwards, while the rest of the bone remains in its\r\nnatural position; and in this manner a fracture is combined with the\r\ndepression.[787] This is the third mode. There are many varieties\r\nof depression, for it may comprehend a greater and a smaller extent\r\nof bone, and may either be to a greater depth, or less so, and more\r\nsuperficial.[788]\r\n\r\n7. When a _hedra_, or dint of a weapon, takes place in a bone,\r\nthere may be a fracture combined with it; and provided there be a\r\nfracture, contusion must necessarily be joined, to a greater or less\r\nextent, in the seat of the dint and fracture, and in the bone which\r\ncomprehends them.[789] This is the fourth mode. And there may be a\r\n_hedra_, or indentation of the bone, along with contusion of the\r\nsurrounding bone, but without any fracture either in the _hedra_\r\nor in the contusion inflicted by the weapon. But the indentation of\r\na weapon takes place in a bone, and is called _hedra_, when the\r\nbone remaining in its natural state, the weapon which struck against\r\nthe bone leaves its impression on the part which it struck. In each\r\nof these modes there are many varieties, with regard to the contusion\r\nand fracture, if both these be combined with the _hedra_, or if\r\ncontusion alone, as it has been already stated that there are many\r\nvarieties of contusion and fracture. And the _hedra_, or dint, of\r\nitself may be longer and shorter, crooked, straight, and circular; and\r\nthere are many varieties of this mode, according to the shape of the\r\nweapon; and they may be more or less deep, and narrower or broader, and\r\nextremely broad. When a part is cleft, the cleft or notch which occurs\r\nin the bone, to whatever length or breadth, is a _hedra_, if the\r\nother bones comprehending the cleft remain in their natural position,\r\nand be not driven inwards; for in this case it would be a depression,\r\nand no longer a _hedra_.[790]\r\n\r\n8. A bone may be injured in a different part of the head from that\r\non which the person has received the wound, and the bone has been\r\nlaid bare. This is the fifth mode. And for this misfortune, when it\r\noccurs, there is no remedy; for when this mischief takes place, there\r\nis no means of ascertaining by any examination whether or not it has\r\noccurred, or on what part of the head.[791]\r\n\r\n9. Of these modes of fracture, the following require trepanning: the\r\ncontusion, whether the bone be laid bare or not; and the fissure,\r\nwhether apparent or not. And if, when an indentation (_hedra_)\r\nby a weapon takes place in a bone it be attended with fracture and\r\ncontusion, and even if contusion alone, without fracture, be combined\r\nwith the indentation, it requires trepanning. A bone depressed from\r\nits natural position rarely requires trepanning; and those which are\r\nmost pressed and broken require trepanning the least; neither does\r\nan indentation (_hedra_) without fracture and contusion require\r\ntrepanning; nor does a notch, provided it is large and wide; for a\r\nnotch and a _hedra_ are the same.[792]\r\n\r\n10. In the first place, one must examine the wounded person, in\r\nwhat part of the head the wound is situated, whether in the stronger\r\nor weaker parts; and ascertain respecting the hairs about the wound,\r\nwhether they have been cut off by the instrument, and have gone into\r\nthe wound; and if so, one should declare that the bone runs the risk\r\nof being denuded of flesh, and of having sustained some injury from\r\nthe weapon. These things one should say from a distant inspection, and\r\nbefore laying a hand on the man;[793] but on a close examination one\r\nshould endeavor to ascertain clearly whether the bone be denuded of\r\nflesh or not; and if the denuded bone be visible to the eyes, this will\r\nbe enough; but otherwise an examination must be made with the sound.\r\nAnd if you find the bone denuded of the flesh, and not safe from the\r\nwound, you must first ascertain the state of the bone, and the extent\r\nof the mischief, and what assistance it stands in need of. One should\r\nalso inquire of the wounded person how and in what way he sustained the\r\ninjury; and if it be not apparent whether the bone has sustained an\r\ninjury or not, it will be still more necessary, provided the bone be\r\ndenuded, to make inquiry how the wound occurred, and in what manner;\r\nfor when contusions and fractures exist in the bone, but are not\r\napparent, we must ascertain, in the first place from the patient’s\r\nanswers, whether or not the bone has sustained any such injuries,\r\nand then find out the nature of the case by word and deed, with the\r\nexception of sounding. For sounding does not discover to us whether the\r\nbone has sustained any of these injuries or not; but sounding discovers\r\nto us an indentation inflicted by a weapon, and whether a bone be\r\ndepressed from its natural position, and whether the bone be strongly\r\nfractured; all which may also be ascertained visibly with the eyes.[794]\r\n\r\n11. And a bone sustains fractures, either so fine as to escape the\r\nsight, or such as are apparent, and contusions which are not apparent,\r\nand depression from its natural position, especially when one person\r\nis intentionally wounded by another, or when, whether intentionally or\r\nnot, a blow or stroke is received from an elevated place, and if the\r\ninstrument in the hand, whether used in throwing or striking, be of a\r\npowerful nature, and if a stronger person wound a weaker. Of those who\r\nare wounded in the parts about the bone, or in the bone itself, by a\r\nfall, he who falls from a very high place upon a very hard and blunt\r\nobject is in most danger of sustaining a fracture and contusion of the\r\nbone, and of having it depressed from its natural position; whereas he\r\nthat falls upon more level ground, and upon a softer object, is likely\r\nto suffer less injury in the bone, or it may not be injured at all.\r\nOf those instruments which, falling upon the head, wound the parts\r\nabout the bone, or the bone itself, that which falls from a very high\r\nplace, and the least on a level with the person struck, and which is\r\nat the same time very hard, very blunt, and very heavy, and which is\r\nthe least light, sharp, and soft, such an instrument would occasion a\r\nfracture and contusion of the bone. And there is most danger that the\r\nbone may sustain these injuries, under such circumstances, when the\r\nwound is direct and perpendicular to the bone, whether struck from the\r\nhand or from a throw, or when any object falls upon the person, or\r\nwhen he is wounded by falling, or in whatever way the bone sustains a\r\ndirect wound from this instrument. Those weapons which graze the bone\r\nobliquely are less apt to fracture, contuse, or depress the bone, even\r\nwhen the bone is denuded of flesh; for in some of those wounds thus\r\ninflicted the bone is not laid bare of the flesh. Those instruments\r\nmore especially produce fractures in the bone, whether apparent or not,\r\nand contusions, and inward depression of the bone, which are rounded,\r\nglobular, smooth on all sides, blunt, heavy, and hard; and such weapons\r\nbruise, compress, and pound the flesh; and the wounds inflicted by such\r\ninstruments, whether obliquely or circularly, are round, and are more\r\ndisposed to suppurate, and to have a discharge, and take longer time\r\nto become clean; for the flesh which has been bruised and pounded must\r\nnecessarily suppurate and slough away. But weapons of an oblong form,\r\nbeing, for the most part, slender, sharp, and light, penetrate the\r\nflesh rather than bruise it, and the bone in like manner; and such an\r\ninstrument may occasion a _hedra_ and a cut (for a _hedra_\r\nand a cut are same thing); but weapons of this description do not\r\nproduce contusions, nor fractures, nor depressions inwardly. And in\r\naddition to the appearances in the bone, which you can detect by the\r\nsight, you should make inquiry as to all these particulars (for they\r\nare symptoms of a greater or less injury), whether the wounded person\r\nwas stunned, and whether darkness was diffused over his eyes, and\r\nwhether he had vertigo, and fell to the ground.[795]\r\n\r\n12. When the bone happens to be denuded of flesh by the weapon, and\r\nwhen the wound occurs upon the sutures, it is difficult to distinguish\r\nthe indentation (_hedra_) of a weapon which is clearly recognized\r\nin other parts of the bone, whether it exist or not, and especially if\r\nthe _hedra_ be seated in the sutures themselves. For the suture\r\nbeing rougher than the rest of the bone occasions confusion, and it\r\nis not clear which is the suture, and which the mark inflicted by the\r\ninstrument, unless the latter (_hedra_) be large. Fracture also\r\nfor the most part is combined with the indentation when it occurs in\r\nthe sutures; and this fracture is more difficult to discern when the\r\nbone is broken, on this account, that if there be a fracture, it is\r\nsituated for the most part in the suture. For the bone is liable to be\r\nbroken and slackened there, owing to the natural weakness of the bone\r\nthere, and to its porosity, and from the suture being readily ruptured\r\nand slackened: but the other bones which surround the suture remain\r\nunbroken, because they are stronger than the suture.[796] For the\r\nfracture which occurs at the suture is also a slackening of the suture,\r\nand it is not easy to detect whether the bone be broken and slackened\r\nby the indentation of a weapon occurring in the suture, or from a\r\ncontusion of the bone at the sutures; but it is still more difficult\r\nto detect a fracture connected with contusion. For the sutures, having\r\nthe appearance of fissures, elude the discernment and sight of the\r\nphysician, as being rougher than the rest of the bone, unless the bone\r\nbe strongly cut and slackened, (for a cut and a _hedra_ are the\r\nsame thing.)[797] But it is necessary, if the wound has occurred at the\r\nsutures, and the weapon has impinged on the bone or the parts about it,\r\nto pay attention and find out what injury the bone has sustained. For a\r\nperson wounded to the same, or a much smaller, extent, and by weapons\r\nof the same size and quality, and even much less, will sustain a much\r\ngreater injury, provided he has received the blow at the sutures, than\r\nif it was elsewhere. And many of these require trepanning, but you must\r\nnot apply the trepan to the sutures themselves, but on the adjoining\r\nbone.[798]\r\n\r\n13. And with regard to the cure of wounds in the head, and the mode\r\nof detecting injuries in the bone which are not apparent, the following\r\nis my opinion:--In a wound of the head, you must not apply anything\r\nliquid, not even wine, but as little as possible, nor a cataplasm, nor\r\nconduct the treatment with tents, nor apply a bandage to an ulcer on\r\nthe head, unless it be situated on the forehead, in the part which is\r\nbare of hairs, or about the eyebrow and eye, for wounds occurring there\r\nrequire cataplasms and bandages more than upon any other part of the\r\nhead.[799] For the rest of the head surrounds the whole forehead, and\r\nthe wounds wherever situated become inflamed and swelled, owing to an\r\ninflux of blood from the surrounding parts.[800] And neither must you\r\napply cataplasms and bandages to the forehead at all times; but when\r\nthe inflammation is stopped and the swelling has subsided, you must\r\ngive up the cataplasms and bandages. A wound in any other part of the\r\nhead must not be treated with tents, bandages, or cataplasms, unless it\r\nalso requires incision. You must perform incision on wounds situated\r\non the head and forehead, whenever the bone is denuded of flesh, and\r\nappears to have sustained some injury from the blow, but the wound\r\nhas not sufficient length and breadth for the inspection of the bone,\r\nso that it may be seen whether it has received any mischief from the\r\nblow, and of what nature the injury is, and to what extent the flesh\r\nhas been contused, and whether the bone has sustained any injury, or\r\nwhether it be uninjured by the blow, and has suffered no mischief; and\r\nwith regard to the treatment, what the wound, and the flesh, and the\r\ninjury of the bone stand in need of. Ulcers of this description stand\r\nin need of incision; and, if the bone be denuded of the flesh, and if\r\nit be hollow, and extend far obliquely, we cut up the cavity wherever\r\nthe medicine cannot penetrate readily, whatever medicine it may be;\r\nand wounds which are more inclined to be circular and hollow, and for\r\nthe most part others of the like shape, are cut up by making a double\r\nincision in the circle lengthways, according to the figure of the man,\r\nso as to make the wound of a long form. Incisions may be practiced with\r\nimpunity on other parts of the head, with the exception of the temple\r\nand the parts above it, where there is a vein that runs across the\r\ntemple, in which region an incision is not to be made. For convulsions\r\nseize on a person who has been thus treated; and if the incision be on\r\nthe left temple, the convulsions seize on the right side; and if the\r\nincision be on the right side, the convulsions take place on the left\r\nside.[801]\r\n\r\n14. When, then, you lay open a wound in the head on account of the\r\nbones having been denuded of the flesh, as wishing to ascertain\r\nwhether or not the bone has received an injury from the blow, you must\r\nmake an incision proportionate to the size of the wound, and as much\r\nas shall be judged necessary. And in making the incision you must\r\nseparate the flesh from the bone where it is united to the membrane\r\n(_pericranium?_) and to the bone, and then fill the whole wound\r\nwith a tent, which will expand the wound very wide next day with as\r\nlittle pain as possible; and along with the tents apply a cataplasm,\r\nconsisting of a mass (_maza_) of fine flour pounded in vinegar,\r\nor boiled so as to render it as glutinous as possible.[802] On the\r\nnext day, when you remove the tent, having examined the bone to see\r\nwhat injury it has sustained, if the wound in the bone be not right\r\nseen by you, nor can you discover what mischief the bone itself has\r\nsustained, but the instrument seems to have penetrated to the bone\r\nso as to have injured it, you must scrape the bone with a raspatory\r\nto a depth and length proportionate to the suture of the patient,\r\nand again in a transverse direction, for the sake of the fractures\r\nwhich are not seen, and of the contusions which are not discovered,\r\nas not being accompanied with depression of the bone from its natural\r\nposition. For the scraping discovers the mischief, if the injuries in\r\nthe bone be not otherwise manifest. And if you perceive an indentation\r\n(_hedra_) left in the bone by the blow, you must scrape the dint\r\nitself and the surrounding bones, lest, as often happens, there should\r\nbe a fracture and contusion, or a contusion alone, combined with the\r\ndint, and escape observation. And when you scrape the bone with the\r\nraspatory, and it appears that the wound in the bone requires the\r\noperation, you must not postpone it for three days, but do it during\r\nthis period, more especially if the weather be hot, and you have\r\nhad the management of the treatment from the commencement. If you\r\nsuspect that the bone is broken or contused, or has sustained both\r\nthese injuries, having formed your judgment from the severity of the\r\nwound, and from the information of the patient, as that the person\r\nwho inflicted the wound, provided it was done by another person, was\r\nremarkably strong, and that the weapon by which he was wounded was of\r\na dangerous description, and then that the man had been seized with\r\nvertigo, dimness of vision, and stupor, and fell to the ground,--under\r\nthese circumstances, if you cannot discover whether the bone be broken,\r\ncontused, or both the one and the other, nor can see the truth of the\r\nmatter, you must dissolve the jet-black ointment,[803] and fill the\r\nwound with it when thus dissolved, and apply a linen rag smeared with\r\noil, and then a cataplasm of the maza with a bandage; and on the next\r\nday, having cleaned out the wound, scrape the bone with the raspatory.\r\nAnd if the bone is not sound, but fractured and contused, the rest of\r\nit which is scraped will be white; but the fracture and contusion,\r\nhaving imbibed the preparation, will appear black, while the rest of\r\nthe bone is white. And you must again scrape more deeply the fracture\r\nwhere it appears black; and, if you thus remove the fissure, and cause\r\nit to disappear, you may conclude that there has been a contusion of\r\nthe bone to a greater or less extent, which has occasioned the fracture\r\nthat has disappeared under the raspatory; but it is less dangerous, and\r\na matter of less consequence, when the fissure has been effaced. But\r\nif the fracture extend deep, and do not seem likely to disappear when\r\nscraped, such an accident requires trepanning. But having performed\r\nthis operation, you must apply the other treatment to the wound.\r\n\r\n15. You must be upon your guard lest the bone sustain any injury from\r\nthe fleshy parts if not properly treated. When the bone has been sawed\r\nand otherwise denuded, whether it be actually sound, or only appears\r\nto be so, but has sustained some injury from the blow, there may be\r\ndanger of its suppurating (although it would not otherwise have done\r\nso), if the flesh which surrounds the bone be ill cured, and become\r\ninflamed and strangled; for it gets into a febrile state, and becomes\r\nmuch inflamed.[804] For the bone acquires heat and inflammation from\r\nthe surrounding flesh, along with irritation and throbbing, and the\r\nother mischiefs which are in the flesh itself, and from these it\r\ngets into a state of suppuration. It is a bad thing for the flesh\r\n(_granulations?_) in an ulcer to be moist and mouldy, and to\r\nrequire a long time to become clean. But the wound should be made to\r\nsuppurate as quickly as possible; for, thus the parts surrounding the\r\nwound would be the least disposed to inflammation, and would become\r\nthe soonest clean; for the flesh which has been chopped and bruised by\r\nthe blow, must necessarily suppurate and slough away. But when cleaned\r\nthe wound must be dried, for thus the wound will most speedily become\r\nwhole, when flesh devoid of humors grows up, and thus there will be no\r\nfungous flesh in the sore. The same thing applies to the membrane which\r\nsurrounds the brain: for when, by sawing the bone, and removing it from\r\nthe meninx, you lay the latter bare, you must make it clean and dry as\r\nquickly as possible, lest being in a moist state for a considerable\r\ntime, it become soaked therewith and swelled; for when these things\r\noccur, there is danger of its mortifying.[805]\r\n\r\n16. A piece of bone that must separate from the rest of the bone,\r\nin consequence of a wound in the head, either from the indentation\r\n(_hedra_) of a blow in the bone, or from the bone being otherwise\r\ndenuded for a long time, separates mostly by becoming exsanguous.\r\nFor the bone becomes dried up and loses its blood by time and a\r\nmultiplicity of medicines which are used; and the separation will take\r\nplace most quickly, if one having cleaned the wound as quickly as\r\npossible will next dry it, and the piece of bone, whether larger or\r\nsmaller. For a piece of bone which is quickly dried and converted, as\r\nit were, into a shell, is most readily separated from the rest of the\r\nbone which retains its blood and vitality; for, the part having become\r\nexsanguous and dry, more readily drops off from that which retains its\r\nblood and is alive.[806]\r\n\r\n17. Such pieces of bone as are depressed from their natural position,\r\neither being broken off or chopped off to a considerable extent, are\r\nattended with less danger, provided the membrane be safe; and bones\r\nwhich are broken by numerous and broader fractures are still less\r\ndangerous and more easily extracted.[807] And you must not trepan any\r\nof them, nor run any risks in attempting to extract the pieces of\r\nbone, until they rise up of their own accord, upon the subsidence of\r\nthe swelling. They rise up when the flesh (_granulations_) grows\r\nbelow, and it grows from the diploe of the bone, and from the sound\r\nportion, provided the upper table alone be in a state of necrosis.\r\nAnd the flesh will shoot up and grow below the more quickly, and the\r\npieces of bone ascend, if one will get the wound to suppurate and make\r\nit clean as quickly as possible. And when both the tables of the bone\r\nare driven in upon the membrane, I mean the upper and lower, the wound,\r\nif treated in the same way, will very soon get well, and the depressed\r\nbones will quickly rise up.[808]\r\n\r\n18. The bones of children are thinner and softer, for this reason,\r\nthat they contain more blood [than those of adults]; and they are\r\nporous and spongy, and neither dense nor hard. And when wounded to\r\na similar or inferior degree by weapons of the same or even of an\r\ninferior power, the bone of a young person more readily and quickly\r\nsuppurates, and that in less time than the bone of an older person; and\r\nin accidents, which are to prove fatal, the younger person will die\r\nsooner than the elder. But if the bone is laid bare of flesh, one must\r\nattend and try to find out, what even is not obvious to the sight, and\r\ndiscover whether the bone be broken and contused, or only contused; and\r\nif, when there is an indentation in the bone, whether contusion, or\r\nfracture, or both be joined to it; and if the bone has sustained any of\r\nthese injuries, we must give issue to the blood by perforating the bone\r\nwith a small trepan, observing the greatest precautions, for the bone\r\nof young persons is thinner and more superficial than that of elder\r\npersons.[809]\r\n\r\n19. When a person has sustained a mortal wound on the head, which\r\ncannot be cured, nor his life preserved, you may form an opinion of\r\nhis approaching dissolution, and foretell what is to happen from the\r\nfollowing symptoms which such a person experiences.[810] When a bone\r\nis broken, or cleft, or contused, or otherwise injured, and when by\r\nmistake it has not been discovered, and neither the raspatory nor\r\ntrepan has been applied as required, but the case has been neglected\r\nas if the bone were sound, fever will generally come on before the\r\nfourteenth day if in winter, and in summer the fever usually seizes\r\nafter seven days. And when this happens, the wound loses its color,\r\nand the inflammation dies in it; and it becomes glutinous, and appears\r\nlike a pickle, being of a tawny and somewhat livid color; and the\r\nbone then begins to sphacelate, and turns black where it was white\r\nbefore, and at last becomes pale and blanched. But when suppuration\r\nis fairly established in it, small blisters form on the tongue and he\r\ndies delirious. And, for the most part, convulsions seize the other\r\nside of the body; for, if the wound be situated on the left side, the\r\nconvulsions will seize the right side of the body; or if the wound be\r\non the right side of the head, the convulsion attacks the left side of\r\nthe body.[811] And some become apoplectic. And thus they die before the\r\nend of seven days, if in summer; and before fourteen, if in winter.\r\nAnd these symptoms indicate, in the same manner, whether the wound be\r\nolder or more recent. But if you perceive that fever is coming on, and\r\nthat any of these symptoms accompany it, you must not put off, but\r\nhaving sawed the bone to the membrane (_meninx_), or scraped it\r\nwith a raspatory, (and it is then easily sawed or scraped,) you must\r\napply the other treatment as may seem proper, attention being paid to\r\ncircumstances.[812]\r\n\r\n20. When in any wound of the head, whether the man has been trepanned\r\nor not, but the bone has been laid bare, a red and erysipelatous\r\nswelling supervenes in the face, and in both eyes, or in either of\r\nthem, and if the swelling be painful to the touch, and if fever and\r\nrigor come on, and if the wound look well, whether as regards the flesh\r\nor the bone, and if the parts surrounding the wound be well, except the\r\nswelling in the face, and if the swelling be not connected with any\r\nerror in the regimen, you must purge the bowels in such a case with a\r\nmedicine which will evacuate bile; and when thus purged the fever goes\r\noff, the swelling subsides, and the patient gets well. In giving the\r\nmedicine you must pay attention to the strength of the patient.[813]\r\n\r\n21. With regard to trepanning, when there is a necessity for it, the\r\nfollowing particulars should be known. If you have had the management\r\nof the case from the first, you must not at once saw the bone down to\r\nthe meninx; for it is not proper that the membrane should be laid bare\r\nand exposed to injuries for a length of time, as in the end it may\r\nbecome fungous. And there is another danger if you saw the bone down to\r\nthe meninx and remove it at once, lest in the act of sawing you should\r\nwound the meninx. But in trepanning, when only a very little of the\r\nbone remains to be sawed through, and the bone can be moved, you must\r\ndesist from sawing, and leave the bone to fall out of itself.[814] For\r\nto a bone not sawed through, and where a portion is left of the sawing,\r\nno mischief can happen; for the portion now left is sufficiently thin.\r\nIn other respects you must conduct the treatment as may appear suitable\r\nto the wound. And in trepanning you must frequently remove the trepan,\r\non account of the heat in the bone, and plunge it in cold water. For\r\nthe trepan being heated by running round, and heating and drying the\r\nbone, burns it and makes a larger piece of bone around the sawing to\r\ndrop off, than would otherwise do. And if you wish to saw at once down\r\nto the membrane, and then remove the bone, you must also, in like\r\nmanner, frequently take out the trepan and dip it in cold water. But if\r\nyou have not charge of the treatment from the first, but undertake it\r\nfrom another after a time, you must saw the bone at once down to the\r\nmeninx with a serrated trepan,[815] and in doing so must frequently\r\ntake out the trepan and examine with a sound (specillum), and otherwise\r\nalong the tract of the instrument.[816] For the bone is much sooner\r\nsawn through, provided there be matter below it and in it, and it often\r\nhappens that the bone is more superficial,[817] especially if the\r\nwound is situated in that part of the head where the bone is rather\r\nthinner than in other parts. But you must take care where you apply the\r\ntrepan, and see that you do so only where it appears to be particularly\r\nthick, and having fixed the instrument there, that you frequently make\r\nexaminations and endeavor by moving the bone to bring it up. Having\r\nremoved it, you must apply the other suitable remedies to the wound.\r\nAnd if, when you have the management of the treatment from the first,\r\nyou wish to saw through the bone at once, and remove it from the\r\nmembrane, you must, in like manner, examine the tract of the instrument\r\nfrequently with the sound, and see that it is fixed on the thickest\r\npart of the bone, and endeavor to remove the bone by moving it about.\r\nBut if you use a perforator (_trepan?_), you must not penetrate to\r\nthe membrane, if you operate on a case which you have had the charge of\r\nfrom the first, but must leave a thin scale of bone, as described in\r\nthe process of sawing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOL.

He is a most learned and\r\ntrustworthy authority on the history of medicine, but in the present\r\ninstance his judgment is biassed by the opinion which was generally\r\nheld in his age with respect to the origin of Grecian philosophy. At\r\nthat time it was customary to follow the later Platonists in tracing\r\nthe rise of philosophy to Egypt. Lord Monboddo, in his work on Ancient\r\nMetaphysics, strongly espouses this opinion, which, in fact, was the\r\nestablished belief of learned men down to a late period. Kant advocated\r\nthe views which are here adopted.\r\n\r\n[3] See in particular the introductory chapters to Ritter’s History of\r\nAncient Philosophy; Thirlwall’s History of Greece, c. xii.; Grote’s\r\nHistory of Greece, P. I., c. xvii. The opinion now generally held on\r\nthis subject may be explained in few words. The Homeric poems are\r\nbeyond all doubt of Grecian origin, for it cannot be shown that the\r\nancient Egyptians or Babylonians had anything resembling a regular\r\nepos. Now, as Mr. Grote well observes, “from the poetry of Homer to\r\nthe history of Thucydides, and the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle,\r\nwas a prodigious step, but it was the native growth of the Hellenic\r\nyouth into the Hellenic man, and what is of still greater moment, it\r\nwas brought about without breaking the thread either of religious or\r\npoetic tradition--without any coercive innovation or violent change in\r\nthe mental feelings. The transition of Grecian mind from its poetical\r\nto its comparatively positive state was self-operated, and accomplished\r\nby its own inherent and expansive force--aided indeed, but by no means\r\neither impressed or provoked, from without.”--L. c.\r\n\r\n[4] Plato, Menex.\r\n\r\n[5] Celsus mentions Pythagoras, Empedocles, and Democritus, as the most\r\ndistinguished of the philosophers who cultivated medicine.--Præfat.\r\n\r\n[6] “Hippocrates primus ab studio sapientiæ disciplinam hanc\r\nseparavit.”--Præfat.\r\n\r\n[7] See the authorities quoted at PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I.,\r\np. 73, Syd. Soc. edition; also in particular Xenophon’s Memorabilia,\r\niii., 13; and Pausanias, ii., 2. The most complete list which is\r\nanywhere given of the ancient Asclepia, is that contained in Schulze’s\r\nHistory of Medicine, i., 24. It is to be regretted, however, that the\r\nreferences to Pausanias are made according to the pages of an old\r\nedition, instead of books and chapters, so that one experiences some\r\ndifficulty in finding the passages referred to. The number of Asclepia\r\nin Greece noticed by him is sixty-four. Plutarch states in positive\r\nterms that all the Temples of Health were erected in high situations,\r\nand where the air was wholesome.--(Quæst. Rom.) On the practice of\r\nmedicine in the Ancient Temples of Health, see further Sprengel, Hist.\r\nde la Méd., e. v. Sprengel, however, does not acknowledge so candidly\r\nas he ought to have done his obligations to his predecessor Schulze.\r\n\r\n[8] Philostratus, Vita Apollonii, i., 9; Strabo, Geogr., xiv.\r\n\r\n[9] Pausanias, vii., 21.\r\n\r\n[10] This I have reason to know is the belief of the learned and\r\nestimable author of the Isis Revelata.\r\n\r\n[11] Aristides, Orat. in Æsculap., viii. It may be proper to state\r\nthat Sprengel, in referring to this passage (Hist. de la Méd., p. 160.\r\nFrench edition), falls into the mistake of saying that these medicines\r\nwere prescribed to Aristides himself.\r\n\r\n[12] Galen, de Administ, Anatom., ii.\r\n\r\n[13] Censura Operum Hippocrat., p. 184.\r\n\r\n[14] Hist. de la Méd., i., 5, p. 175, French edit. Schulze, in like\r\nmanner, depreciates the anatomical knowledge of the Asclepiadæ, and\r\nholds that it had been overrated by Galen.--Hist. Med., i., 2, 5.\r\n\r\n[15] Comment, in Libr. de Artie, iii., 28; de Decret. Hippocrat. et\r\nPlaton., viii., I.\r\n\r\n[16] Polit., iii., 399; ed.

Notwithstanding the high compliment\r\nwhich Aristotle here pays to the professional reputation of\r\nHippocrates, there can be no doubt that he does not always make proper\r\nacknowledgment for the many obligations which he lies under to the Coan\r\nsage. Galen states repeatedly that the greater part of Aristotle’s\r\nphysiology is derived from Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[22] See some ingenious observations on these mythical genealogies\r\nin Grote’s History of Greece., vol. i., p. 593. He holds that they\r\nare altogether unworthy of credit, or at least that there is no test\r\nwhereby one can separate the true from the false in them. Clinton,\r\nindeed, in his Fasti Hellenici, attaches more importance to them; but\r\napparently Mr. Grote’s judgment on them is perfectly just. See further\r\nvol. ii., p. 53, etc.\r\n\r\n[23] Noctes Atticæ, xvii., 21.\r\n\r\n[24] That Hippocrates drew the rudiments of his medical knowledge from\r\nthe reports of cases collected in the Asclepion of Cos, is attested by\r\ngood authorities. See Strabo, Geogr., xiv.; Pliny, H. N., xxix., 2.\r\n\r\n[25] On the introduction of the gymnastic exercises into the practice\r\nof medicine, see Schulze, Hist. Med., i., 2, 8. The author of the VI.\r\nEpidem. condemns Herodicus for using exercises in the treatment of\r\nacute diseases. Herodicus is frequently mentioned in the Dialogues of\r\nPlato. See Protagoras, § 20; and de Repub., iii. Plato says, that being\r\nin ill health, he wore out first himself and afterwards many others, by\r\ncombining gymnastics with medicine.\r\n\r\n[26] Somnus alludes to this fiction, and quotes Andreas as an authority\r\nfor it. See also Pliny, H. N., xxix., 2. Tzetzes calls it the Temple of\r\nCos, and not of Cnidos, which was burned.\r\n\r\n[27] See Plato, Protagoras.\r\n\r\n[28] Galen, Comment. in Libr. de Nat. Human.\r\n\r\n[29] Suidas in voce Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[30] It was a common practice in ancient times to kindle great fires\r\nas _disinfectants_ or _deodorizers_. We have entered pretty\r\nfully upon this subject in our Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nVol. I., p. 274. There can be no doubt that it was the established\r\npractice of the profession in the days of Hippocrates. The names of\r\nAcron, Empedocles, and Hippocrates are particularly famous as having\r\nsuccessfully adopted the practice. See Aëtius, v., 94; Paulus Ægineta,\r\nl. c.; Pliny, H. N., xxxvi., 69; and Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride.\r\n\r\n[31] Hist., iii., 87.\r\n\r\n[32] It deserves to be mentioned further, as adding probability to the\r\npresent narrative, that it was quite common in ancient times for the\r\nAsclepiadæ to be publicly consulted by cities and States respecting the\r\ngeneral health of the inhabitants, and this both for the prevention and\r\ncure of diseases. See Aristid. Opera, i., p. 81.\r\n\r\n[33] Galen, in many parts of his works, alludes to the professional\r\nservices of Hippocrates during the great plague described by\r\nThucydides. He mentions decidedly that Thucydides gives only\r\nthose symptoms which would strike a common, that is to say, a\r\nnon-professional man; whereas Hippocrates describes the disease\r\naccurately like a professional man, but gives few of those symptoms\r\nwhich appeared most interesting to Thucydides.--De Difficult. Respir.,\r\nii., 7.\r\n\r\n[34] Thucydides mentions that the mortality of the plague was greatly\r\naggravated by the influx of the people from the country into the city,\r\nand the crowding of them in ill-ventilated huts. (ii., 52.) Mitford,\r\nin describing the plague of Athens, remarks that the want of sewers\r\nin ancient times must have contributed very much to the severity of\r\nthe disease. (Hist. of Greece, vol. ii., p. 195.) He refers (l. c.) to\r\nStrabo (Geogr. v.) for proof that the Romans were the first people who\r\nconstructed sewers.\r\n\r\n[35] See Xenophon, Cyropæd., i. and viii.\r\n\r\n[36] Galen, Comment in libr. de Artic. iii.\r\n\r\n[37] Xenophon, Anabasis, i. It has never been clearly determined\r\nwhether he was in the suite of Artaxerxes the king, or of his brother\r\nCyrus, before the battle of Cunaxa, in which the latter was killed,\r\nand the former being severely wounded, was attended professionally by\r\nCtesias. Diodorus Siculus, indeed, says decidedly that he was taken\r\nprisoner on the occasion. (Bibl. ii., 32.) But we are certain, from the\r\nauthentic narrative of Xenophon, that he was not taken prisoner in the\r\nbattle, nor is it likely that he was one of those who were kidnapped\r\nafterwards, otherwise the historian would certainly not have omitted\r\nthe name of so distinguished a personage. Besides, had he been brought\r\nto Babylon in this way, as a captive, Artaxerxes was not likely to\r\nhave intrusted his royal life to a person who had been so lately the\r\nprofessional attendant on his rebel brother.\r\n\r\n[38] See Thucyd., ii., 48.\r\n\r\n[39] De Prisca Medicina.\r\n\r\n[40] See in the next section, under xxiii. Though I have not admitted\r\nthe treatise here referred to into the list of genuine works, it will\r\nbe seen below that it possesses considerable evidence in its favor, and\r\nthat beyond doubt it is very ancient.\r\n\r\n[41] Aphor., I., 1.\r\n\r\n[42] See Galen, Opera, tom. v., p. 488; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[43] This is clearly defined and stated by Aristotle, Phys., i. See\r\nalso Boethius in Præd., p. 113; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[44] This is the more remarkable, as it does not appear to have been\r\nthe established creed of the greatest literary men and philosophers\r\nof the age, who still adhered or professed to adhere to the popular\r\nbelief in the extraordinary interference of the gods with the works of\r\nNature and the affairs of mankind. This at least was remarkably the\r\ncase with Socrates, whose mind, like that of most men who make a great\r\nimpression on the religious feelings of their age, had evidently a deep\r\ntinge of mysticism. See Xenoph. Memor., i., 1, 6–9; Ibid. iv., 7, 7;\r\nalso Grote’s History of Greece, vol. i., p. 499. The latter remarks,\r\n“Physical and astronomical phenomena are classified by Socrates among\r\nthe divine class, interdicted to human study.” (Mem., i. 1, 13.) He\r\nadds, in reference to Hippocrates, “On the other hand, Hippocrates,\r\nthe contemporary of Socrates, denied the discrepancy, and merged into\r\none the two classes of phenomena--the divine and the scientifically\r\ndeterminable,--which the latter had put asunder. Hippocrates treated\r\nall phenomena as at once both divine and scientifically determinable.”\r\n(p. 499.) He then quotes the memorable passage in the treatise “On\r\nAirs,” etc. It does not appear, however, that in ancient times the\r\ncharge of Atheism was ever brought against him. It has been urged\r\nagainst him by modern fanatics, but scarcely deserves a serious\r\nrefutation. See Schulze (Hist. Med., i., 3, 2), and Ackerman (Hist.\r\nLit. Hippocr., pp. xii, xiii; ed. Kühn). By such persons, whoever does\r\nnot join in their anthropomorphical notions of a first cause is held up\r\nfor an Atheist.\r\n\r\n[45] For the medicine of the ancient Jews, Egyptians, and Babylonians,\r\nsee the introductory chapters of Sprengel’s Hist. de la Méd.

Basil.\r\n\r\n[79] Galen, who is a most unexceptionable judge in such a case, says\r\nthat the language of Hippocrates inclines to the Attic, and that some\r\nhad held it to be Old Attic. (Tom. v., p. 525; ed. Basil.) Dionysius\r\nof Halicarnassus, another admirable critic, says that Herodotus is the\r\nmost excellent standard of the Ionic (and so, by the way, Photius also\r\nsays, under the head of _Ctesias_) and Thucydides of the Attic.\r\n(De Platon. Judicium.) Now, since we have already made it appear that\r\nthere is a most striking similarity between the language of Hippocrates\r\nand Thucydides, the judgment of Dionysius is evidently in accordance\r\nwith that of Galen on this point. Indeed, as briefly stated in the\r\ntext, the Attic was nothing more than a new development of the Ionic,\r\nand scarcely more different from it than the English language in the\r\nage of Pope is from the same in the age of Milton. It is to be borne\r\nin mind that the name Ionian was originally applied to the Thracians\r\nand the inhabitants of Attica, who were evidently closely allied to\r\none another in consanguinity. It was in Thrace that learning and\r\ncivilization first sprang up under the auspices of Thamyris, Orpheus,\r\nand Musæus, by whom the elegant arts were transplanted to Athens.\r\n(See Hesychius, in voce Iones; Eustathius, ad Iliad., ii.; Diogenes\r\nLaertius, _Prœfat_.; also Hermes Philologus, p. 23, by the author\r\nof this disquisition, whose mind now reverts with great delight, _ad\r\nstudia quæ adolescentiam alebant_.) The inhabitants of Asiatic Ionia\r\nand the adjoining islands were colonists from Attica. (Thucyd., i.,\r\n12; Herodotus, viii., 44; Heraclides, de Polit.) From what has been\r\nstated it will readily be understood that the only standard of polite\r\nGreek was the Ionic, with its offspring the Attic. The Æolic and Doric\r\ndialects, although used in certain scientific and popular compositions,\r\nsuch as Bucolics and certain philosophical treatises, were never looked\r\nupon as being fashionable and learned dialects.\r\n\r\n[80] De Artic., i.\r\n\r\n[81] See his Historia Literaria Hippocratis, in the Bibliotheca Græca\r\nof Albertus Fabricius, or in vol. i. of Kühn’s edition of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[82] Galen, tom. v., p. 17; ed.

In this\r\npassage Strabo states, that before the restoration of the library by\r\nApellicon, there were but few of Aristotle’s works in the hands of the\r\nperipatetic philosophers, and these principally his exoteric works. But\r\nthat the treatise “On the History of Animals” was an exoteric work, can\r\nadmit of no question. This is confidently maintained by the learned\r\nSchneider in the prolegomena to his edition of this work. Indeed, as\r\nhe suggests, there is no good reason for doubting that the treatise\r\n“On the History of Animals” had been published by Aristotle in his\r\nlifetime. (Epimetrum, ii.) See also Buhle’s dissertation prefixed to\r\nhis edition of Aristotle’s works. I need scarcely add that, it being\r\nthus shown that all the most learned authorities on the literature of\r\nAristotle’s works are agreed that the History of Animals, in which is\r\ncontained this disputed fragment on the veins, was published before the\r\ntime when the Hippocratic Collection is supposed to have been made, M.\r\nLittré’s conclusions on this head must fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n[98] The death of Aristotle is referred to A.C. 321. Now\r\nthis is just about the date of the foundation of the Royal Library at\r\nAlexandria, and very near the age when Herophilus flourished. These (M.\r\nLittré’s) positions clearly made out, it would follow that the dates of\r\nthe treatises in the Collection come down very near to the foundation\r\nof the Alexandrian Library.\r\n\r\n[99] See Hengstenberg’s Commentary on the Psalms, pluries.\r\n\r\n[100] Although this piece be admitted into the first class, it also\r\nmerits a place here.\r\n\r\n[101] Prænotiones or Prognostica; Aphorismi; Epidemiorum, i., iii.; de\r\nDiæta Acutorum; de Aëre, Aquis, et Locis; de Capitis Vulneribus.\r\n\r\n[102] De Prisca Medicina; de Articulis; de Fracturis; Mochlicus;\r\nJusjurandum; Lex; de Ulceribus; de Fistulis; de Hæmorrhoidibus; de\r\nOfficina Medici; de Morbo Sacro.\r\n\r\n[103] Prorrhetica, i.; Coacæ Prænotiones.\r\n\r\n[104] De Natura Hominis; de Salubri Victus Ratione; de Natura Muliebri;\r\nde Morbis, ii., iii.; de Superfœtatione.\r\n\r\n[105] De Flatibus; de Locis in Homine; de Arte; de Diæta; de Insomniis;\r\nde Affectionibus; de Internis Affectionibus; de Morbis, i.; de\r\nSeptimestri Partu; de Octimestri Partu; Epidemiorum, ii., iv., vii.; de\r\nHumoribus; de Usu Liquidorum.\r\n\r\n[106] Epistolæ; Thessali Legati Oratio; Oratio ad Aram; Atheniensium\r\nSenatus-Consultum.\r\n\r\n[107] De Genitura; de Natura Pueri; de Morbis, iv.; de Mulierum Morbis;\r\nde Virginum Morbis; de Sterilibus.\r\n\r\n[108] Epidemiorum, v., vii.; de Corde; de Alimento; de Carnibus; de\r\nSeptimanis; de Natura Ossium; de Glandulis; de Medico; de Decenti\r\nhabitu; Præceptiones; de Anatomia; de Dentitione; de Exsectione Fœtus;\r\nde Visu; de Crisibus; de Diebus Criticis; de Medicamentis Purgativis.\r\n\r\n[109] Hippocrat.

Littré contends\r\nsignifies, “ce qu’Hippocrate et la raison _pourraient dire_.”\r\nNow I must say that, to me, the words of Plato here quoted do not\r\nwarrant the interpretation which M. Littré puts upon them; and, not\r\nsatisfied with my own judgment on this point, which happens in the\r\npresent instance to be an important one, I applied to one of the best\r\nauthorities in Britain on the minutiæ of the Greek language for his\r\nopinion, and was happy to find that it entirely corresponded with my\r\nown. Having alluded in the text to the prolixity of the discussion\r\nwhich M. Littré enters into on this occasion, I trust that eminent\r\nscholar will not be offended (provided these pages ever meet his eyes)\r\nif I introduce here an anecdote of the celebrated Kuster. Having been\r\nshown a work in which the quantity of argumentation and reflection\r\ngreatly over-balanced the amount of facts and references, he laid it\r\naside with the remark, “I find nothing here but reasoning: _non sic\r\nitur ad astra_.”\r\n\r\n[115] Galeni Opera, tom. v., p. 119; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[116] Comment. vii.; et sect. vii., 53 et seq.\r\n\r\n[117] See under _Hippocrates_ in Smith’s Greek and Roman\r\nBiographical and Mythological Dictionary.\r\n\r\n[118] “In all paroxysms, or sharp fits of intermitting diseases, we\r\nmust take away meat, for then to give it is hurtful.”\r\n\r\n[119] “The belly is naturally hottest in winter and the spring,\r\nand most addicted to rest. Consequently in these seasons a greater\r\nproportion of food is to be allowed, because the inward heat is\r\nstronger, which is the reason that a more plentiful food is necessary.\r\nThis difference may be seen in such as are old, and in such as are\r\nlusty and well-grown bodies.”\r\n\r\n[120] “Those things that are or have been justly determined by nature,\r\nought not to be moved or altered, either by purging or other irritating\r\nmedicines; but should be left alone.”\r\n\r\n[121] “Things evacuated and purged are not to be estimated by the\r\nmultitude and quantity, but by their fitness to be avoided and sent\r\nforth; and must be such as are not too troublesome to the patient to\r\nbear. Though, where it is necessary, we must proceed in evacuating,\r\neven to swooning and fainting, if the patient can bear it.”\r\n\r\n[122] “Those who are grieved in any part of the body, and are scarce\r\nsensible of their grief, have a distempered mind.”\r\n\r\n[123] “When the upper parts of the throat or gullet are sore, or a\r\nbreaking out of small tumours does arise in the body, we ought to look\r\nupon the excrements; for if they are choleric, the body is also sick;\r\nbut if they are like the excrements of sound persons, the body may be\r\nnourished without danger.”\r\n\r\n[124] “When that which ought to be evacuated is discharged by\r\nspontaneous vomiting and diarrhœa, it is useful and easily endured; but\r\nwhen otherwise, the contrary. _This is equally true with regard to\r\nevery vessel_,” etc.\r\n\r\n[125] “They in whom the greatest vigor of the disease is immediately\r\nperceived, are to be immediately sparingly supplied with food; but from\r\nthose in whom it occurs later, the food must at that time, or a little\r\nearlier, be abstracted. Previously, however, we must nourish more\r\nfreely, that the sick may be supported.”\r\n\r\n[126] “Whilst the crisis is forming, and when it is complete, nothing\r\nought to be moved or to be introduced, whether by purgatives or other\r\nirritants; but all should be left at rest.”\r\n\r\n[127] “They who are accustomed to daily labor, although even weak or\r\nold, endure it more easily than the robust or young, who are even\r\naccustomed to it.”\r\n\r\n[128] “In regard to the seasons, if the winter has been dry and cold,\r\nand the spring moist and warm, in summer acute fevers, ophthalmias, and\r\ndysenteries must necessarily occur, chiefly, however, among females and\r\nmen of pituitous temperament.”\r\n\r\n[129] Tom. v., p. 399; ed, Basil.\r\n\r\n[130] “The state of the air being, upon the whole, dry, with a south\r\nwind, which was just contrary to what happened the year before, when\r\nthe north chiefly prevailed; there were but few inflammatory fevers,\r\nand these were of a mild disposition, very few being attended with\r\nhemorrhages, and much fewer, if any, with death.” (p. 4.)\r\n\r\n“They affected children, young persons, and those who were arrived at\r\nyears of maturity, and especially those who used much exercise, yet but\r\nfew women.” (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n“Before the summer, and even during that season, nay, in winter\r\nlikewise, there were many who had been disposed to a phthisis who were\r\nnow afflicted with that disease,” etc. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n“The extremities were generally very cold, there was seldom any heat in\r\nthem.” (p 3.)\r\n\r\n[131] Præfat.

Dr. Coray supposes\r\nthat Hippocrates represents himself as being a European, in consequence\r\nof his having composed this treatise in Europe, at a distance from his\r\nnative country. But there is no necessity for this supposition, as\r\nHippocrates, being of Grecian descent, would naturally enough consider\r\nhimself a European, since the great body of the Greeks were Europeans.\r\nCoray mentions a striking instance of Haller’s incapacity to form a\r\ncorrect judgment on the works of Hippocrates, from want of a proper\r\nacquaintance with the Greek language.--Discours Préliminaire, etc., p.\r\nlvi.\r\n\r\n[140] De Placit.

See also (and this\r\npassage is very decisive) de Diæta in Morb. Acut., § 5; and Galen’s\r\nCommentary, pluries.\r\n\r\n[197] The strongest argument in favor of its being a production of the\r\nCnidian school is the mode of treating pneumonia here laid down, which\r\ncertainly in so far agrees with what Galen says of Cnidian practice\r\nin such cases, namely, that those authorities omitted bleeding and\r\npurging. See Opera, tom. v., p. 87.\r\n\r\n[198] See under Ἱππωκράτης. The meaning of the passage, however, is\r\nsomewhat doubtful.\r\n\r\n[199] Comment, in Lib. Vict. Acut., i., p. 43; ed.

From\r\nthis we may infer that the present work was not known in his days; for\r\nit can scarcely be supposed that he would have spoken so disparagingly\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n[204] Galen quotes it as a portion of the work on Diet. See Opera, tom.\r\nv., p. 377; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[205] This idea is well explained and enlarged upon by Alexander\r\nAphrodisiensis.--Probl. i., 118.

The term τρύπανον was generally applied to the\r\ntrepan. The epithet τρυγλητήριον, or, as Foës proposes to read it,\r\nτρωλοδυτήριων, is probably derived from τρώγλη, a hole, and δύω, to\r\npenetrate; joined together, they would signify a trepan for boring\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n[216] Morb.

On the other hand, Mart.\r\nLister justly defends Hippocrates: “A me sane absit illa quorundam\r\nnuperorum scriptorum jactantia, qui nihil exhibent, nisi quod bonum\r\neventum habuit; errores et infortunia caute abscondunt, aliter autem\r\nnobis profuit magnus Hippocrates, apud quem fere non nisi casus funesti\r\noccurrunt, ac si iidem potioris doctrinæ essent.”--Exercit. de Hydrope.\r\n\r\n[233] Acut. Morb., iii., 17.\r\n\r\n[234] Perspiratio dicta Hippocrati.\r\n\r\n[235] By Nature, the ancient philosophers understood an immaterial\r\nprinciple diffused through all the works of creation, that is to say,\r\nan internal principle of motion and of rest, which presides over\r\nthe growth and nourishment of all substances. It is well defined by\r\nAristotle in different parts of his works. See De Anima, ii., 4; and\r\nAuscultationes Naturales, pluries. That truly learned and ingenious\r\nauthor Bishop Berkeley, in his “Siris,” describes nature as being mind\r\nso fuddled with matter as to have lost its consciousness. Probably, the\r\ndistinction between a material and immaterial principle as the cause\r\nof the vital phenomena was not so well understood until after Plato\r\nand Aristotle had cultivated mental philosophy with so great success;\r\nfor, as we shall see in the next section, Hippocrates seems to identify\r\nmind with heat, that is to say, he confounds the cause of motion and of\r\nchange with its first instrument, _or_ co-cause (συνάιτιον).\r\n\r\n[236] See the references given by Gruner, Ackerman, and Littré.\r\n\r\n[237] See Musonius, Ap.

On the latter, see Quintilian, Instit. Orator., iv.,\r\n2. We possess a volume of these Declamations under the name of\r\nQuintilian, but they are not generally admitted to be genuine. They\r\nare exercises on themes prescribed in the schools of rhetoric. The\r\nsubjects were sometimes historical events, connected with the lives of\r\ndistinguished personages. The poet Juvenal alludes to Declamations in\r\nseveral places, as in Satir. i., 16; x., 167; vi., 169; vii., 161. The\r\nSatyricon of Petronius Arbiter opens with a powerful invective against\r\nthe declaimers of the day, whom the author holds to have been the\r\ncorrupters of all true eloquence.\r\n\r\n[276] Scaliger, Menage, Gruner, and Littré, although they regard the\r\nEpistles as spurious, admit that they are “very ancient.”\r\n\r\n[277] See Diog.

It may be proper to mention here that it\r\nis not true, as has been often stated in modern works, that Pythagoras\r\nhimself taught the same system of the world as Copernicus; the first\r\nperson who did so was Philolaus the Pythagorean philosopher.

But were it really\r\nso, it would hardly have found an advocate in the learned and pious\r\nauthor of “Paradise Lost.” That such was truly his opinion can now\r\nadmit of no doubt, from what he states on the subject in his treatise\r\non Christianity, published some years ago by the present Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury; and the same might have been inferred from more than\r\none passage in his great poem. The Jewish philosopher, Philo, seems to\r\nadmit the eternity of matter, although he denies the eternity of the\r\nworld. (On the Creation.)\r\n\r\n[334] “There are varieties,” says Strabo, “of the watery element; for\r\nthis kind is saltish, and that sweet, and fit for drink; and others\r\nagain poisonous, salutary, deadly, cold, and hot.”--Geograph., xvii.,\r\n1. See also Aristot., Meteorol.\r\n\r\n[335] Aristotle inquires whether the atmosphere be a single substance\r\nor many, and if many, of how many it consists. (Meteorol., i., 3.) I\r\nmay be allowed to remark in this place, that Galen’s ideas regarding\r\nrespiration are wonderfully accurate, and not very different from\r\nthose now entertained by the profession. Thus he compares the process\r\nof respiration to combustion, and says it produces the same change\r\nupon atmospheric air. He further agrees with modern physiologists in\r\nconsidering it as the vital operation by which the innate (or animal)\r\nheat is preserved. (De Respiratione.) Compare this treatise with Baron\r\nCuvier’s admirable section on Respiration and observe on how many\r\npoints these two great physiologists agree. (Leçons d’Anatom. Compar.,\r\n26.)\r\n\r\n[336] Timæus.\r\n\r\n[337] De Igne.\r\n\r\n[338] De Partibus Animalium, ii., 2. His great commentator, Averrhoes\r\nthe Arabian, states this distinction very correctly. See Cantic.\r\nAvicennæ, tr. v.\r\n\r\n[339] Lucan’s Pharsalia, i., 157, 606.\r\n\r\n[340] De Carnibus. (See the preceding section.) In like manner\r\nPhornutus says, “our souls are fire.” (De Nature Deorum, ap. Gale’s\r\nOpuscula Mythologica, p. 142.) Such is also said to have been the\r\ndoctrine of Hippocrates and Democritus. See Macrobius (Somnium\r\nScipionis, i., 14); and Nemesius (de Nat. Hominis). In the Hippocratic\r\ntreatise De Septimadibus, which M. Littré has discovered in Latin, the\r\nessence of the soul is held to be heat. (Ed. Littré, i., p. 391.)\r\n\r\n[341] De Partibus Animalium, ii., 7.\r\n\r\n[342] De Anima, ii., 4.\r\n\r\n[343] Ὄτι πᾶν ἐκ πάντος γινέσθαι πέφυκε.--Aristot. de Ortu et Interitu.\r\net Auscultationes Naturales, i.\r\n\r\n[344] See Simon’s Chemistry, vol. i., p. 118, and the authorities there\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n[345] Baron Cuvier says: “En un mot, toutes les fonctions animales\r\nparoissent en reduire à des transformations de fluides; et c’est dans\r\nla manière dont ces transformations s’opérent, que gît le véritable\r\nsecret de cette admirable économie.”--Leçons d’Anatom. Comp. lib. i.\r\n\r\n[346] It will be readily understood that allusion is here made to the\r\ndiseases ossification and osteosarcoma.\r\n\r\n[347] The same application of this myth is made by Eustatheus, the\r\ncommentator on Homer (ad Odyss., iv., 417), and by Heraclides Ponticus\r\n(Gale’s Opuscula Mytholog., p. 490). The words of Heraclides are very\r\nstriking: “That hence it was with good reason that the formless matter\r\nwas called Proteus; and that Providence which modified each being with\r\nits peculiar form and character was called Eidothia.”\r\n\r\n[348] De Sapient. Vet., cap. xiii.\r\n\r\n[349] Op. cit., iv.\r\n\r\n[350] These opinions of Newton bear a strong resemblance to those of\r\nStrabo, as expressed in the following passage: “Since all things are in\r\nmotion and undergoing great changes, it is to be supposed that neither\r\ndoes the earth always remain the same, so as neither to be augmented\r\nnor diminished; nor yet water; nor that either always possesses the\r\nsame seat, for that a change of one thing into another seems very much\r\naccording to nature. For that much earth is converted into water, and\r\nmuch water into earth.”--Geograph., xvii., 1.\r\n\r\n[351] See p. 120, Ray Society’s edition.\r\n\r\n[352] See Simon’s Chemistry, vol. i., p. 5; Sydenham Society’s edition.\r\nThe etymology of the term _protein_ is there given from πρωτέυω,\r\n_I am first_; but it may more properly be derived from Proteus, to\r\nwhich, as we have mentioned above, the first matter was likened.\r\n\r\n[353] Lucretius, de R. N., i., 48.\r\n\r\n[354] I have always looked upon the story of the Sirens as being one\r\nof the most beautiful fictions in the Homeric poems. By the two Sirens\r\nI cannot but think that the poet meant to represent Philosophy and\r\nMelody, these being, as it were, the handmaids of Poetry. They assail\r\nthe virtue of Ulysses with no vulgar temptations, by assuring him that\r\nthey were well acquainted with all the martial exploits in which he had\r\nbeen engaged, and that he would leave them “much delighted, and with an\r\nincrease of knowledge.”\r\n\r\n    Ἀλλ’ ὄγε τερψάμενος νεἰται καὶ πλέιονα ἐιδώς.\r\n                                         Odyss, xii., 188.\r\n\r\n[355] Diogenes Laertius, in fact, states that Xenophanes, the founder\r\nof the school, held the doctrine of the four elements. On the Eleatic\r\nphilosophy, see further, Aristotle (de Xenophane; and Metaphys.,\r\ni., 5); and, of the modern authorities Ritter (History of Ancient\r\nPhilosophy, vol. i.,) and Grote (Hist. of Greece, tom. iv., p. 518,\r\netc.) Whether or not these modern authors, however, have rightly\r\napprehended the doctrine of Xenophanes and Anaximander with regard to\r\nthe elements, may, I think, be justly doubted. Dr. Thirlwall gives\r\na very judicious exposition of the ethical opinions of the Eleatic\r\nphilosophers, but does not touch on their physical. (Hist. of Greece, §\r\n12.)\r\n\r\n[356] M. Littré is inclined to give the Pythagorean philosopher,\r\nAlcmæon, the credit of priority in broaching the philosophical theory\r\nwhich runs through this treatise. His only authority, however, on this\r\npoint is Plutarch (De Placit. Philos., v., 30); whereas Galen, as he\r\nadmits, says expressly that Hippocrates himself is the author of this\r\ntheory. Now, I must say that, of the two, Galen appears to me to be\r\nthe better authority, being profoundly skilled both in medical and\r\nphilosophical literature. But further, neither Diogenes Laertius in his\r\nlife, nor any other writer who has noticed Alcmæon, says anything of\r\nhis having promulgated the theory of the Crasis.\r\n\r\n[357] Tom. i., p. 567.\r\n\r\n[358] See Note, p. 191.\r\n\r\n[359] The invention of bread must have been very ancient, as is obvious\r\nfrom the circumstance of its being referred to a mythological name,\r\nthat is to say, Demeter _or_ Ceres. The ancients would appear to\r\nhave paid great attention to the manufacture of bread. See Athenæus\r\nDeipnos, iii., 26; and PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. I., 78, Syd. Soc.\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[360] The maza was a sort of pudding _or_ cake made from\r\nbarley-meal mixed up with water, oil, milk, oxymel, hydromel, or the\r\nlike. It also was a very ancient invention, for it is mentioned in one\r\nof the works of Hesiod, which is universally allowed to be genuine, I\r\nmean the Opera et Dies, 1., 588.\r\n\r\n[361] We have stated in our brief sketch of the Life of Hippocrates,\r\nthat he studied the application of gymnastics to medicine under the\r\ngreat master of the art, Herodicus. He was a native of Selymbra in\r\nThrace, and is generally represented as the father of medicinal\r\ngymnastics; but, as we have mentioned above, this statement must be\r\nreceived with considerable allowance, since there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the Asclepiadæ applied exercises to the cure of diseases.\r\n\r\n[362] He means both the pilot and physician.\r\n\r\n[363] Καθαρὸς ἄρτος ἢ συγκομιστός. There has been some difference\r\nof opinion regarding these two kinds of bread; but it appears to me\r\nprobable that the former was made of flour from which the bran had been\r\nentirely excluded, and the other from flour containing the whole of the\r\nbran. Later authorities called the one _siligo_, and the other\r\n_autopyrus_. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., p. 121.\r\n\r\n[364] He alludes here to the secretions and humors in the body. See the\r\nCommentary of Heurnius.\r\n\r\n[365] See Littré, h. 1.\r\n\r\n[366] Meaning probably the diaphragm, with its membranes. See the\r\nCommentary of Heurnius, p. 92.\r\n\r\n[367] Meaning the mammæ, according to Heurnius.\r\n\r\n[368] Such as the spleen and lungs.\r\n\r\n[369] Although I shall touch cursorily on this subject in my\r\nannotations, I cannot deny myself the pleasure of setting down here the\r\nfollowing passage from the treatise of Longinus “On the Sublime.” It is\r\nto be borne in mind that it was written by a noble-minded Greek, who\r\nlived at the court of an Oriental despot, and must have been a daily\r\nobserver of the effects which he so feelingly depicts. Who does not\r\nlament to think of a generous mind placed under circumstances where\r\ncowardice is honored and courage debased? And what more melancholy\r\npicture of human misery can be imagined than that which is here\r\nexhibited of the bodily and mental powers in a state of arrested\r\ndevelopment from the effects of confinement?\r\n\r\nἭμισυ γάρ τ' ἀρετῆς (κατὰ τὸν Ὅμηρον) ἀποαίνυται δύλιον ἦμαρ· ὥσπερ οὖν\r\n(εἴγε γησὶ, τοῦτο πιστόν ἐστι) ἀκούω τὰ γλωττόκομα, ἐν οἱς οἱ Πυγμαῖοι\r\nκαλούμενοι νάνοι τρέφονται, οὐ μόνον κωγύει τῶν εγκεκλεισμένων τὰς\r\nαὐξήσεις, ἀλλὰ καὶ συνάγει διὰ τὸν περικείμενον τοῖς σώμασι δεσμόν· οὒ\r\nτως ἅπασαν δουλείαν, καὶ ἦ δικαιοτάτη, ψυχῆς γλωττόκομον, καὶ κοιόν δή\r\nτις ἀποφήναιτο δεσωπτήριον.--§ 39.\r\n\r\n[370] M. Littré thus states the four principal points to which\r\nHippocrates here directs attention:\r\n\r\n“1st. Il cherche quelle est, sur le maintein de la santé et la\r\nproduction des maladies, l’influence de l’exposition des villes par\r\nrapport au soleil et aux vents.\r\n\r\n“2d. Il examine quelles sont les propriétés des eaux, bonnes ou\r\nmauvaises.\r\n\r\n“3d. Il s’efforce de signaler les maladies qui prédominent suivant les\r\nsaisons, et suivant les alternatives que chacune d’elles épreuve.\r\n\r\n“4th. Enfin, il compare l’Europe et l’Asie, et it rattache les\r\ndifférences physiques et morales qui en séparent les habitants, aux\r\ndifférences du sol et du climat.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on, however, to state, that these four questions, although\r\nneatly put, are merely sketched, and half insinuates that it is a\r\ndefect in the work, that it merely contains our author’s assertions,\r\nwithout the corresponding proofs. In a modern work, he remarks, the\r\nmode of procedure would be different; for it would be expected that the\r\ngeneral truths should be supported by detailed and prolonged statistics\r\non particular facts. It is to be borne in mind, however, that the work\r\nof Hippocrates was probably meant merely as a text-book, on which were\r\ngrounded his public prelections, wherein would, no doubt, be given all\r\nthe necessary proofs and illustrations. In this respect, it resembles\r\nthe esoteric works of Aristotle, of which the author of them said that\r\nwhen they were published the contents of them, in one sense, were not\r\ncommunicated to the public, as they would be unintelligible without\r\nthe illustrations by which they were accompanied when delivered in his\r\nschool. In conclusion, I would beg leave to remark that, if the work\r\nof Hippocrates, in its present form, appear defective when compared\r\nwith what a modern work on the same subject would be expected to be,\r\nit has also peculiar traits which would hardly be matched in a modern\r\ncomposition. In a modern work we might have a greater abundance of\r\nparticular facts, and a more copious detail of individual observations,\r\nbut would there be such an exuberance of general truths, of grand\r\nresults, and of original reflections?\r\n\r\n[371] The classical reader is referred to Theophrastus’ treatise De\r\nSignis Aquarum et Ventorum, for much interesting information on this\r\nsubject.--See also Galen, Op. tom. v., p. 346, 347, ed.

In the old French\r\ntranslation it is rendered thus: “Elles sont très différentes entre\r\nelles par leur nature, et il arrive d’ailleurs une infinité de\r\nchangemens qui sont tous divers.” On these changes, see Aphor. iii.,\r\n2–15.\r\n\r\n[386] I have translated this passage agreeably to the reading suggested\r\nby Coray, that is to say, ὀυκ ἐδωδὸς, which appears to be a great\r\nimprovement, although it is not adopted by Littré. Without the negation\r\n(ὀυκ) the contrast between the first and the last clause of the\r\nsentence is entirely lost. It will be remarked that I have translated\r\nἀριστητάι, eating to excess. The ἄριστον, or dinner, was a meal which\r\npersons of regular habits seldom partook of, and hence Suetonius\r\nmentions it as an instance of Domitian’s gormandising propensities,\r\nthat he was in the habit of taking dinner.--See Vita Domitiani; also\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, B. I., 109.\r\n\r\n[387] It will be remarked that our author uses meteorology and\r\nastronomy almost as synonymous terms. In his time meteorology was\r\nlooked upon by practical men as a visionary subject of investigation,\r\nwhich had a tendency to make those who engaged in it atheists, and the\r\nenemies of Socrates took advantage of the prejudices then prevailing\r\nagainst it to represent him as a meteorologist. See Aristophanes\r\n(Nub. 225.) Aristophanes, who would appear to have been always too\r\nready to pander to the popular prejudices of the day, also represents\r\nthe physicians as being “meteorological impostors,”--μετεωροφένακας.\r\n(Ibid. 330.) The enlightened mind of Aristotle, however, regarded\r\nmeteorology in a very different light, and accordingly he wrote a\r\nwork on the subject replete with all the astronomical and geological\r\nknowledge of his time. In it he professes to treat of the heavenly\r\nbodies and atmospherical phenomena, including winds, earthquakes and\r\nthe like; also of minerals, fossils, etc. See the introduction to his\r\n_Meteorologica_.\r\n\r\n[388] Upon reference to the editions of Coray, Clifton, and Littré, it\r\nwill be seen that the text here is in a doubtful state. I shall not\r\nweary the reader by stating my reasons for adhering to the meaning\r\nwhich I have adopted.\r\n\r\n[389] In place of the common reading, παιδίον, Coray adopts θεῖον which\r\ncertainly, at first sight, appears to be an improvement. But I admit,\r\nwith Littré, that the authority of Galen (tom. v., p. 447, ed. Basil),\r\nis quite decisive in favour of παιδίον. It is also to be taken into\r\naccount in this place that the author of the treatise on Dentition\r\nbrings prominently into view the connection between infancy and\r\nconvulsions, which adds probability to the supposition that in those\r\ndays convulsions may have been called “the disease of infancy.”\r\n\r\n[390] The Hepialus is a species of intermittent fever, very common in\r\nwarm climates. It would appear to be a variety of the quotidian. See\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., 252, Syd. Soc. edition.\r\n\r\n[391] Frequent mention of this disease of the skin occurs in the works\r\nof the ancient writers on medicine. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol.\r\nII., 40. We have there stated that it would appear to have been some\r\nspecies of Eczema, with which we are now unacquainted. Coray has a\r\nvery lengthy note on it, but arrives at no satisfactory conclusions on\r\nthe subject. He brings into review three cutaneous diseases, namely,\r\nthe _bouton d’Alep._. (described, Mémoir. de la Société Royale\r\nde Médic., année 1777, 1778, t. i., p. 313;) the _pelagre_,\r\n(described, Toaldo, Essai Méteorolog., pp. 19, 20; Comment. de Rebus\r\nin Scient. Nat. et Médec. Gestis., tom. xxxi., p. 553; and Journ. de\r\nMédec. tom. lxxx., p. 272;) and the _lepre des Asturies_ or _mal\r\nde la rosa_, (described by Thieri, Journ. de Médec., tom. ii., p.\r\n337.)\r\n\r\n[392] _Coups de soleil_, or strokes of the sun, are often\r\nmentioned incidentally in the works of the ancient authors, but no\r\none has treated of them in any very systematic manner, as far as I\r\nrecollect. On the effects of exposure to cold and heat, see, however,\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., 49–51, Syd. Soc. edition.\r\n\r\n[393] Ῥηγματα καὶ σπάσματα. There has been much difference of opinion\r\nas to the exact import of these two terms. It would appear to me that\r\nthey were intended to apply to a rupture or straining of the fibres,\r\noccasioned by external violence. M. Littré has a very interesting note\r\non this subject, tom. v., p. 579. On these strainings see further Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, 376, 418. M. Littré, l. c., relates a case of empyema\r\nbrought on by lifting a heavy piece of wood. On these terms see further\r\nthe Annotations on Demosthenes, Olynth. ii., 8, ed. Dobson; and Foës,\r\nŒc. Hippocr.\r\n\r\n[394] Clifton translates this clause of the sentence thus: “Even if\r\nthere be but a small distance between them,” and, I think, correctly,\r\nalthough Coray is not quite satisfied with this interpretation. The\r\nstadium was _nearly_ the eighth part of a Roman mile, that is to\r\nsay, it consisted of 94½ French toises, or 625 English feet.\r\n\r\n[395] In another place, I have given a summary of the information\r\nsupplied by the ancient authors on this subject, (PAULUS\r\nÆGINATA, Vol. I., 66.) Upon the whole, none of them gives so\r\nmuch valuable matter on it as our author. Coray has some elaborate\r\nannotations on this passage.\r\n\r\n[396] It can scarcely admit of a doubt that our author here alludes to\r\nscurvy. (See Coray at this place, and Lind on Scurvy, iii., 1.) He also\r\ndescribes the disease distinctly in the second book of Prorrhetics,\r\nthat is to say, if Hippocrates be actually the author of that book.\r\nSee also Epidem. ii., 1; de Affection., de inter. affect.; Cælius\r\nAurelianus, Tard. Pass. iii., 4; Celsus, iv., 9; Aëtius, x., 11; Pliny,\r\nH. N., xxv., 3; Aretæus, Morb. Diuturn, i., 14; and Paulus Ægineta,\r\niii., 49; Marcellus, de Medic. ii.\r\n\r\n[397] The leucophlegmasia is treated of in different parts of the\r\nHippocratic treatises, as Aphor. vii., 29; de Morb. ii. By it he\r\nevidently meant a species of dropsy, as Galen remarks in his commentary\r\non the Aphorisms (l. c.). It occurs in Aretæus’s chapter on dropsy.\r\nMorb. Diuturn. ii., 1; Octavius Horatianus, v. Celsus makes it to be\r\nsynonymous with anasarca, iii., 21. Our author would seem to notice\r\nthese varieties of dropsy as being affections to which pregnant women\r\nare subject.\r\n\r\n[398] On hydrops uteri see the authorities quoted in the Commentary on\r\nPAULUS ÆGINATA, B. III., 48, Syd. Soc. edition. It may appear\r\nsingular that hydatids of the womb should be particularly prevalent\r\nin the case of women that drink unwholesome water from marshes, and\r\nyet our author’s observation is confirmed by a modern authority as\r\nquoted by Coray: “Il a été également prouvé par les observations des\r\nModernes, que les fausses grossesses produites par les hydatides; sont\r\ntrès-communes dans les pays marécageux, ou la plupart des habitans\r\nont une constitution lâche, propre à l’affection scorbutique, qui\r\ny est presque endémique, qu’elles terminent plus ou moins tard par\r\nl’excrétion de ces hydatides.”--(Notes sur le Traité des Airs, &c., p.\r\n106.) Sydenham, moreover, describes the symptoms of false pregnancy in\r\nmuch the same terms as our author. (Tract de Hydrop.)\r\n\r\n[399] On the Thermal waters of the ancients, see PAULUS ÆGINATA, Vol.\r\nI., 72. I have treated fully of the ancient _alum_ and _nitre_ under\r\nστυπτηρία and λίτρον, in the Third Volume. Coray, in his notes on this\r\npassage, does not throw much light on this subject. The opinion here\r\ndelivered by our author, that these metallic substances are produced by\r\nthe operation of heat, is adopted and followed out by Aristotle towards\r\nthe end of the third book on Meteorologia.\r\n\r\n[400] Corny appears to me to be unnecessarily puzzled to account for\r\nour author’s statement, that saltish waters, although held to be\r\npurgative, are, in fact, astringent of the bowels. But, although their\r\nprimary effect certainly be cathartic, is it not undeniable that their\r\nsecondary effect is to induce or aggravate constipation of the bowels?\r\nCertain it is, moreover, that all the ancient authorities held salts\r\nto be possessed of desiccant and astringent powers. See PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Vol. III., under ἂλες.\r\n\r\n[401] Aristotle discusses the subject in his Problems, ii., 9, 36, 37;\r\nii., 15; i., 53; v., 34, and arrives at nearly the same conclusions as\r\nHippocrates. See also Theophrastus de Sudoribus.\r\n\r\n[402] I cannot hesitate in adopting the emendation suggested by Coray\r\n(ἀποσήθεσθαι) in place of the common reading (ἀποσήπεσθαι), which\r\nevidently has no proper meaning in this place. I am surprised that M.\r\nLittré should have hesitated in admitting it into the text.\r\n\r\n[403] Athenæus, in like manner, praises rain water. Deipnos ii., 5.\r\n\r\n[404] It appears singular that Athenæus, who is undoubtedly a most\r\nlearned and judicious authority on all matters relating to Dietetics,\r\nspeaks as favorably of water from ice as he does of rain water. Both\r\nhe praises for their lightness, (l. c.) Celsus gives the character\r\nof the different kinds of water with his characteristic terseness\r\nand accuracy: “Aqua levissima pluvialis est; deinde fontana; tum ex\r\nflumine; tum ex puteo: post hæc ex nive, aut glacie; gravior his ex\r\nlacu; gravissima ex palude,” (ii., 19.) Galen treats of the medicinal\r\nand dietetical properties of water in several of his works, and\r\nuniformly agrees with Hippocrates in the judgment he pronounces on\r\nthem. See in particular, De Ptisana; De Sanit. tuend. ii.; Comment. ii.\r\nin Libr. de Ratione victus in Morb. acut.\r\n\r\n[405] Athenæus, on the other hand, argues from the fact that ice is\r\nlighter than water, that water formed from ice must be light. Pliny\r\ngives a lucid statement of the opinions of those who held that water\r\nfrom ice is light and wholesome, and those who, like Hippocrates,\r\nheld it to be just the reverse. He says in the words of Hippocrates,\r\nliterally translated, “nec vero pauci inter ipsos e contrario ex\r\ngelu ac nivibus insaluberrimos potius prædicant, quoniam exactum sit\r\ninde, quod tenuissimum fuerit.” (H.N. xxxi., 21.) See also Seneca,\r\nQuæst. Natural. iv. It would appear that iced _liqueurs_ were\r\ngreatly relished at the tables of _gourmands_ in those days. I\r\nneed scarcely remark that there has been great difference of opinion\r\nin modern times regarding the qualities of water from melted snow and\r\nice. It was at one time generally believed that it is the cause of the\r\ngoîtres to which the inhabitants of the valleys bordering on the Alps\r\nare subject. This opinion, however, is by no means generally held at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n[406] This is a most interesting chapter, as containing the most\r\nancient observations which we possess on the important subject of\r\nurinary calculi. The ancients never improved the theory, nor added much\r\nto the facts which are here stated by our author. We have given the\r\nsummary of their opinions in the Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nB. III., 45. I would beg leave to remark that, notwithstanding the\r\nnumber of curious facts which modern chemistry has evolved regarding\r\nthe composition of urinary calculi, the etiology of the disease is\r\nnearly as obscure now as it was in the days of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[407] Coray remarks that Prosper Martian, in his commentary on this\r\npassage, confirms the truth of the observation here made, that persons\r\naffected with calculus have the bowels constipated.\r\n\r\n[408] Theophilus, in his treatise De Urinis, would seem to contradict\r\nthis observation of Hippocrates, when he states that the urine of\r\ncalculous persons is thick and milky (8.) But, according to Prosper\r\nMartian, when the calculus is in the state of formation, its characters\r\nare as described by the latter, whereas, when the calculus is already\r\nformed, the urine is limpid, as described by Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[409] It is worthy of remark that Celsus states just the reverse with\r\nregard to the practice of women laboring under the stone; he says:\r\n“Feminæ vero oras naturalium suorum manibus admotis scabere crebro\r\ncoguntur.” (ii., 7.) Are we to suppose that he followed a different\r\nreading? Considering how well he shows himself acquainted with the\r\nworks of Hippocrates, it cannot be thought that he had overlooked this\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n[410] Our author, it will be remarked, ascribes the comparative\r\nimmunity from calculus which females enjoy to their freer use of\r\nliquids. Celsus, in laying down directions for the regimen of a\r\ncalculous person, as preparatory for the operation, among other things,\r\ndirects, “ut aquam bibat,” (vii., 26–2.) Coray collects the opinions of\r\nseveral modern authorities in favor of drinking water as a preventive\r\nof calculus. Thus Tissot states that the Chinese, who drink so much\r\nwater with their tea, enjoy almost an immunity from the disease. (De la\r\nSanté des Gens de Lettres, p. 196,) Campfer, in like manner, affirms\r\nthat calculus has become less common in Europe since the introduction\r\nof tea, which he justly attributes to the amount of water drunk with\r\nit, rather than to any virtues of the plant itself. (Comment de Reb. in\r\nscient. nat. et medic. gestis, vol. xvi., p. 594.) Metzger attributes\r\nthe diminution of the number of calculous cases in Königsberg to the\r\nuse of draughts of tepid water. (Journal de Médec., vol. lxvii., 348.)\r\nThe Turks, according to Thevenot, owing to their free use of water, are\r\nalmost exempt from the disease. (Voyage au Lévant, c. xxvii., p. 70.)\r\n\r\n[411] Coray makes the following remarks on the natural characters of\r\nthe seasons in Greece. The natural temperature of the winter in Greece\r\nwas cold and humid; thus a dry and northerly winter was reckoned an\r\nunnatural season. Spring was reckoned unnatural when the heat and rain\r\nwere excessive. See further Theophrast. de Caus. Plant. ii., 1.\r\n\r\n[412] See Aphorism iii., 11.\r\n\r\n[413] The celebrated Haller charges Hippocrates with inaccurate\r\nobservation in stating that dysenteries are epidemic in spring, which,\r\nhe contends, is contrary to modern experience. (Bibl. Med. Pract., vol.\r\ni., p. 61.) Hippocrates, however, is defended by Gruner (Cens. libr.\r\nHippocrat. ii., 5, p. 51), and by Coray. (Notes, etc., p. 159.) The\r\nlatter justly argues, that although dysentery may not prevail at that\r\nseason in Germany, that is no reason for holding why it may not be\r\nso in Greece. He also refers to the works of Birnstiel and Stoll for\r\ndescriptions of epidemical dysentery, occurring in the season of spring.\r\n\r\n[414] See Aphorism iii., 12; also Aristot. Probl. i., 9; Celsus, ii., 1.\r\n\r\n[415] Coray, in this place, refers to an epidemic of the same\r\ndescription related by Caillar, which prevailed in the winter of 1751,\r\nand was treated by emetics more successfully than by bleeding.\r\n\r\n[416] By sphacelus of the brain Clifton understands “paralytic\r\ndiseases,” which is not far removed from the conclusion which we have\r\narrived at respecting it in the Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nVol. I., p. 365. See Coray’s lengthened note on this passage.\r\n\r\n[417] Aphorism, iii., 13.\r\n\r\n[418] Aphorism, iii., 14.\r\n\r\n[419] I have stated in my analysis of the short treatise “On Purgative\r\nMedicines,” that the author of it forbids the administration of these\r\nmedicines, that is to say, of drastic purgatives, during excessive heat\r\nor cold.\r\n\r\n[420] One may see, upon consulting the editions of Clifton, Coray, and\r\nLittré, that there are great varieties of readings in regard to the\r\nword which I have translated “affectionate.” It will be remarked that I\r\nhave followed Coray and Littré in reading εύοργητότερα. Clifton adopts\r\nἀεργότερα, and translates it “unactive.”\r\n\r\n[421] This expression of our author is ambiguous. Coray explains it\r\nthus: “il entend le lever d’été, qu’il place à 45 degrés de l’Est au\r\nNord, dans l’horizon de la Grece, et particulièrement celui de l’île de\r\nCos; et le lever d’hiver qu’il place à 45 degrés de l’Est au Sud.”\r\n\r\n[422] The sense undoubtedly requires this addition, and therefore I\r\nhave not scrupled to follow the reading of Cornarius, καὶ τοῡ θερμοῡ.\r\n\r\n[423] The term here used meant particularly the fructus horæi, or\r\nsummer fruits; namely, cucumbers, gourds, and the like. (See PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, B. I., § 80.) Surely Coray forgot himself, when he wrote\r\nthus regarding the distinction between the summer and autumnal fruits\r\nof his country: “les Grecs entendoient particulièrement par ὡρᾱια les\r\nfruits de la fin de l’été, c’est-à-dire, de cette partie de l’année\r\nqu’ils appelloient ὀπώραν, etc.”\r\n\r\n[424] It is but too apparent that there is a lacuna in the text here. A\r\nchapter devoted to an examination of the peculiarities of the Egyptians\r\nand Libyans is evidently lost. As M. Littré has remarked, Galen appears\r\nto refer to the contents of the lost chapter. (Opera, tom. xvi., p.\r\n392; ed. Kühn.)\r\n\r\n[425] That is to say, the Sea of Azoff. See Herodotus, iv., 86, who\r\ncalls it Μαιῆτις. This was generally held to be the division between\r\nEurope and Asia, as stated by our author. As Coray remarks, its borders\r\non the north-west are occupied by the inhabitants of Little Tartary:\r\nit has the Crimea on the south-west; the Tartars of Cuban and the\r\nCircassians on the south-east.\r\n\r\n[426] That the inhabitants of a country bear a resemblance to the\r\ncountry itself, is no doubt a profound and most philosophical remark,\r\nalthough it must be admitted that the comparisons which our author\r\nmakes are somewhat quaintly expressed, and hence a German physician\r\nwished the passage expunged, as being unworthy of Hippocrates. (Comment\r\nde Reb. in Scient. Natur. et Med. gestis, vol. xx., p. 131.) There\r\ncan be no question, however, that it embodies a grand general truth,\r\nalthough the particular application of it may not always be apparent.\r\n\r\n[427] On the Macrocephali, see Pliny, H. N. vi., 4; Stephanus, de\r\nUrbibus; Suidas and Harpocration in Μακροκέφαλοι; Pomponius Mela, i.,\r\n19; Strabo, xii.; Scholiast Apollon. Rhod., i.; Dionysius Periegetes.\r\n\r\nThe exact situation of the savage nation of the Macrocephali cannot\r\nbe precisely determined, but it was evidently not far from the Palus\r\nMæotis, and most probably in the vicinity of the Caucasus. Little is\r\nknown of them, except what our author says respecting the practice\r\nwhich they had of disfiguring their heads by squeezing them, in early\r\ninfancy, into an elongated shape. It is well known that the same absurd\r\nusage prevailed among the early inhabitants of MEXICO. I need\r\nscarcely say that much important information respecting them has been\r\nobtained of late years. M. Littré, in the fourth vol. of his edition of\r\nHippocrates, supplies some very important information in illustration\r\nof this subject, from a recent publication of Dr. H. Rathke. Certain\r\ntumuli having been excavated at Kertch, in the Crimea, there were found\r\nin them, besides different utensils and statues, several skeletons,\r\nand it was most remarkable that the form of the head was greatly\r\nelongated, in the manner described by Hippocrates with regard to the\r\nMacrocephali. The author’s words are: “On y remarquait, en effet, un\r\nhauteur extraordinaire par rapport au diamètre de la base, et par là\r\nils frappaient même les personnes qui n’avaient aucune connaissance de\r\nla structure du corps humain.”\r\n\r\n[428] The same theory respecting the secretion of the semen is given\r\nin the treatises “De Genitura” and “De Morbo Sacro.” It is espoused by\r\nGalen, in his little work. “Quod animal sit quod utero continetur.”\r\nCoray remarks that Hippocrates’s theory on the origin of the fœtus does\r\nnot differ much from that of Buffon.\r\n\r\n[429] I need scarcely remark that both the river and city of this name\r\nare very celebrated in ancient mythology and history. See in particular\r\nApollonius Rhodius, with his learned Scholiast, Arg. II.; Strabo, xi.;\r\nPliny, H. N., vi., 4; Procopius, Pers., ii., 29; Mela, i., 85; Arrian,\r\nperiplus. The river takes its rise in the Caucasus, and terminates in\r\nthe Black Sea. It is called _Rion_ by the inhabitants, and the\r\nriver and a city situated upon it are called _Fache_ by the Turks.\r\nSee Coray at this place, and Mannert., Geograph., iv., 394.\r\n\r\n[430] Coray quotes from Lamberti, a modern traveller, a description\r\nof the Colchide and its inhabitants, which agrees wonderfully with\r\nthe account of both given by our author. The following is part of his\r\ndescription: “Il sito della Colchide porta seco un’ aria tanto humida\r\nche forse in altro luogo non si è veduta la simile. E la ragione si è\r\nperchè venendo dall’ occidente bagnata, dall’ Eusino, et dall’ oriente\r\ncinta dal Caucaso, dal quale sorgano gran quantità di fiumi rende\r\nda per tutto l’aria humidissima affatto. A questo s’ aggiungono la\r\nfrequenza de’ boschi, fra quali non viene agitata l’aria da’ venti, et\r\nli spessi venti marini apportatoi di pioggie et de’ vapori del mare.\r\nQuesta humidità si grande genera poi gran quantità de’ vapori, che\r\nsollevati in alto si dissolvono in frequentissime pioggie.”--Relatione\r\ndella Colchide, c. 27. He goes on to state that a great part of the\r\ninhabitants are fishers.\r\n\r\n[431] It is singular that Procopius, on the other hand, states that\r\nthe Phasis is a very rapid river, and Chardin confirms his statement.\r\n(Voyage en Perse, vol. i., p. 105.) Lamberti reconciles these\r\ndiscrepant accounts by explaining that the river is rapid in its course\r\nnear where it rises among the mountains, but quite smooth and stagnant\r\nwhen it arrives at the plain.--Relat. dell Colchid., 29.\r\n\r\n[432] The best practical proof of the justness of our author’s\r\nreflections in this place is the result of the battle of Salamis; and\r\nthe noblest intellectual monument which ever the wit of man has raised\r\nto the triumph of freedom is the Persæ of Æschylus, in celebration of\r\nthat event. A single line, descriptive of the Greeks, is sufficient to\r\naccount for their superiority to the Asiatics:\r\n\r\n    Οὔ τινος δοῦλοι κέκληνται φωτὸς, οὐδ' ὑπήκοοι.--1., 240.\r\n\r\nNone seem to have felt the force of this great truth so much as the\r\nPersian despots themselves, or to have estimated the effects of\r\ncivil liberty higher than they did. The younger Cyrus, before the\r\nbattle of Cynaxa, addresses his Grecian soldiers in the following\r\nmemorable words: Ὦ ἄνδρες Ἕλληνες, οὐκ ἀνθρώπων ἀπορῶν βαρβάρων\r\nσυμμάχους ἡμᾶς ἄγω, ἀλλὰ νομίζων ἀμείνονας καὶ κρείττους πολλπῶν\r\nβαρβάρων ὑμᾶς εἶναι διὰ τοῦτο προσέλαβον ὅπως οὖν ἔσεσθε ἄνδρες ἄξιοι\r\nτῆς ἐλευθερίας, ἧς κέκτησθε, καὶ ὑπὲρ ἧς ὑμᾶς ἐγὼ εὐδαιμονίζω· εὖ\r\nγὰρ ἴστε, ὅτι τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἑλοίμην ἂν ἀντὶ ὧν ἔχω πάντων καὶ ἄλλων\r\nπολλαπλασίων.--Anab., i., 7. Such being the established opinions of\r\nthe intelligent portion of mankind in the days of Hippocrates, the\r\nsentiment here expressed would then be regarded as a self-evident\r\ntruth. Plato, indeed, modifies this opinion in so far when he holds\r\ndespotism to be the consequence and not the cause of servility.--De\r\nRepub., viii.\r\n\r\n[433] The name Sauromatæ or Sarmatæ was applied by the ancient\r\ngeographers to certain inhabitants of that vast and, to them, nearly\r\nunexplored country, extending from the Sinus Codanus _or_ Baltic\r\nSea, to the Euxine _or_ Black Sea. It comprehends, then, a large\r\nportion of Russia, Poland, and perhaps Prussia. (See Pomponius Mela,\r\niii., 4; Ptolemy, Geograph.; and Maltebrun, Geograph., vol. i., p.\r\n126.) That the Sarmatians and Scythians were the same race of men,\r\nalthough some of the authorities make a distinction between them, can\r\nscarcely admit of a doubt. Our author, it will be remarked, seems to\r\nrestrict the name to a peculiar race of Scythians, who lived near the\r\nPalus Mæotis (_or_ Sea of Asaph). From the account which he gives\r\nof them it is impossible to doubt that he alludes to the Amazonians, so\r\ncelebrated in ancient legends. The opinion which I entertain of them is\r\npretty fully stated in the Argument to this treatise. That our author\r\nshould not have doubted the real existence of the Amazonians need\r\nexcite no wonder, considering the very positive and very circumstantial\r\naccount of them given by his contemporary Herodotus (iv., 110–18).\r\n\r\n[434] It may at first sight appear singular that our author should have\r\nmixed up his account of the Scythians with allusions to the Egyptians;\r\nbut he probably had in view Herodotus (ii., 103–6), who connects the\r\nEgyptians with the Scythians, and more especially with the tribe of\r\nthem called Colchians. He states in particular that the Colchians and\r\nEgyptians resembled one another in the fashion of their linen, their\r\nwhole course of life, and in their language.\r\n\r\n[435] Herodotus (iv., 28, 29) and Strabo (Geogr., vii.), assign the\r\nsame reason for the Scythian cattle not having horns.\r\n\r\n[436] This description evidently applies to the wandering tribes\r\nwhich roam over the steppes of Tartary. The passage is of classical\r\ncelebrity, for I cannot but fancy that certainly Virgil (Georg.,\r\niii., 349–83), and perhaps Horace (Od. iii., 24), had it in view\r\nwhen they drew their pictures of the nomadic life of the Scythians.\r\nThe extraordinary cold of that region, notwithstanding its southern\r\nlatitude, has not been exaggerated by ancient authors; but to account\r\nfor it, as the modern traveller, Clark, remarks, is still a problem\r\nwhich no one has solved. Strabo mentions that carts were driven\r\nacross the Palus Mæotis (Geogr., vii., 3). The chariots covered in\r\nfrom the inclemency of the weather with a roof of felt, are described\r\nalso by Strabo (Geogr., l. c.); and, according to Dr. Coray, similar\r\ncontrivances are still to be found among the Kalmucs and other savage\r\nnations. (Notes sur le Traité des Airs, etc., h. 1.) A preparation from\r\nmilk resembling the hippace is still used by the inhabitants of that\r\nregion. On the people who lived upon this composition from milk, see in\r\nparticular Strabo, vii., 3.\r\n\r\n[437] The following lines of Virgil, referred to above, may be almost\r\nsaid to be a translation of this passage:\r\n\r\n    “Semper hiems, semper spirantes frigora Cauri.\r\n    Tum sol pallentes haud unquam discutit umbras;\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Talis Hyperboreo septem subjecta trioni\r\n    Gens effrena virûm Rhiphæo tunditur Euro.”\r\n\r\nIt was in this region of mist and cold that the celebrated race of the\r\nCimmerians resided. See Herodot., i., 6, etc.; Homer, Odyss. x., 14.\r\nThe montes Rhiphæi would appear to have been the Ural mountains which\r\nseparate Russia from Siberia.\r\n\r\n[438] It is well known now that excessive cold has a tendency to retard\r\nthe growth of animals. This opinion is confirmed in several instances\r\nby Pallas (Voy. en Russie, i., 197; iii., 431.) Strabo mentions, as the\r\nconsequences of the cold which prevails in the country of the Getæ,\r\nthat there are no asses in it, the cattle want horns, and the horses\r\nare small. (Geogr., vii., 3.)\r\n\r\n[439] Buffon, on the other hand, maintains that the Nomadic race\r\nare men of active habits. (Hist., Nat., tom. iii., p. 384.) Pallas,\r\nhowever, confirms the judgment of Hippocrates. (Voyag. en Russie, tom.\r\ni., p. 499.) See also Coray, ad. h. l.\r\n\r\n[440] It is to be borne in mind that Hippocrates, and after him most of\r\nthe ancient authorities, held that the fœtus is formed from the male\r\nsemen. This doctrine prevailed generally down to the days of Harvey.\r\nSome of the ancient physiologists, however, maintained that “omne\r\nanimal est ab ovo.” See Plutarch, de Placit. Philos.\r\n\r\n[441] Ὑγρότης, when applied to the body, may signify both humidity and\r\nrelaxation, in like manner as the adjective (ὑγρὸς) signifies humid and\r\nrelaxed. We shall see an example of the latter signification in the\r\nPrognostics.\r\n\r\n[442] This practice came to be one of the regular operations of\r\nsurgery, being performed with the view of correcting the tendency of\r\na joint to dislocation. It is minutely described by Hippocrates (De\r\nArtic., xi.), Paulus Ægineta, (VI., 42), Albucasis (Chirurg., i., 27),\r\nHaly Abbas (Pract., ix., 78). See the Sydenham Society’s edition of\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, 1. c.\r\n\r\n[443] The meaning of this passage is ambiguous. I have followed Coray,\r\nwho gives some very interesting annotations on it. He translates these\r\nwords, “Ils sont naturellement d’une complexion lâche et trapus;\r\npremièrement, parceque dans leur enfance ils ne sont point emmaillotés,\r\nnon plus que les Ægyptiens.” Clifton has given nearly the same meaning\r\nof the passage: “Their fluidness and breadth proceed first from their\r\nneglect of bandages, as in Egypt.” Littré, on the other hand, appears\r\nto give a different interpretation of the passage: “D’abord parceque on\r\nne les emmaillotte pas, comme en Egypte.”\r\n\r\n[444] A fat condition of the body was also supposed adverse to\r\nconception in the case of cattle. Virgil alludes to this opinion, and\r\nthe means used to counteract the effects of an excessively fat state\r\nof the body in the following verses, which have been always admired as\r\nan example how delicately a great genius can touch upon an indelicate\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n    “Ispa autem macie tenuant armenta volentes,\r\n    Atque, ubi concubitus primos jam nota voluptas\r\n    Sollicitat, frondesque negant, et fontibus arcent.\r\n    Sæpe etiam cursu quatiunt et sole fatigunt;\r\n    Hoc faciunt nimio ne luxu obtusior usus\r\n    Sit genitali arvo, et sulcos oblimet inertes;\r\n    Sed rapiat sitiens venerem, interiusque recondat.”\r\n\r\n    Georg., iii., 136.\r\n\r\n\r\n[445] On the nature of this affection see the Argument. There is a\r\nvariety in the reading, most of the MSS. having ἀνανδριείς, but the one\r\nusually marked 2146, which is followed in the Aldine edition, reading\r\nἀνδριεῖς. See a long discussion in Coray’s edition on this point. There\r\nseems to be no good reason for at all interfering with the text as it\r\nnow stands.\r\n\r\n[446] Our author in this place, as in the treatise on the Sacred\r\nDisease, holds the philosophical opinion in opposition to the\r\nsuperstitious, that all diseases have natural causes, and that no one\r\nmore than another is to be ascribed to the extraordinary interference\r\nof supernatural beings. Plato, his contemporary, would appear to have\r\nendeavored to steer a sort of middle course between the scientific and\r\nthe popular belief. Thus he ascribes epilepsy, like all other diseases,\r\nto a natural cause, namely, in this instance, to a redundancy of black\r\nbile; but he qualifies this opinion by calling the passages of the\r\nbrain (the ventricles?) most divine, and adds that the disease had been\r\nmost appropriately denominated sacred. (Timæus, § 66.)\r\n\r\n[447] The origin and signification of this term are by no means well\r\ndefined. See Galen (Exeges, etc.), Foës (Œcon. Hippocr.), and Coray\r\n(ad h. l.). It has been applied first, to certain varieties of morbus\r\ncoxarius; secondly, to chronic buboes, superinduced by disease of the\r\nhip-joint; thirdly, to paralysis of the muscles about the genital\r\norgans; fourthly, aneurismal varix. (See Aretæus, Morb. Acut., ii.,\r\n8; and the note in Boerhaave’s edition.) I must own that I find some\r\ndifficulty in deciding to which of these significations I should give\r\nthe preference; I rather incline, however, to the first, from what our\r\nauthor says towards the end of this section, namely, that all men who\r\nride much “are afflicted with rheums in the joints, sciatica and gout,\r\nand are inept at venery.”\r\n\r\n[448] This opinion of our author was no doubt founded on the erroneous\r\nnotion regarding the distribution of the veins which prevailed in his\r\ntime, and which we find advocated in the tract “on the Nature of Man,”\r\nand elsewhere. (See Aristot., H. N., iii., 3.) Coray strives hard, in\r\nhis annotations on this passage, to make out that the fact may be as\r\nstated by his ancient countryman, although the hypothesis by which\r\nhe explained it be false. It is singular, however, that, after the\r\nlapse of more than two thousand years, Phrenology should have come to\r\nthe assistance of Hippocrates in this case. I need scarcely remark\r\nthat Gall and his followers hold that the cerebellum is the seat of\r\nthe animal appetites, so that, if this be really the fact, a close\r\nsympathy between the back of the head and the genital organs may be\r\nvery legitimately inferred. At all events, this coincidence between\r\nancient observation and modern hypothesis must be admitted to be very\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n[449] Aristotle, on the other hand, holds that the effects of\r\nequitation are aphrodisiac. (Probl. iv., 12.) Coray attempts to\r\nreconcile the discordant opinions of the physician and philosopher, by\r\nsupposing that moderate exercises may excite the venereal appetite,\r\nwhereas excessive extinguish them. Van Swieten agrees with Hippocrates\r\nthat inordinate exercise in riding may induce impotence. (Comment. in\r\nBoerh. Aphor., § 1063.)\r\n\r\n[450] It is a singular idea of our author that the wearing of breeches\r\nby confining the development of the genital organs impairs the sexual\r\ndesires. It is curious, as remarked by Coray, that the same opinion is\r\nadvocated by Hunter in his treatise on the Venereal Disease. Coray also\r\nquotes the following passage from Lalement: “Sæpe audivimus pistores et\r\ncæteros quorum partes pudendæ subligaculis non obteguntur sed liberius\r\npendent crassos et bene nutritos habere testiculos.”--Comment. in\r\nHippocrat. de Aer., etc.\r\n\r\n[451] I trust I shall be excused in quoting entire Dr. Coray’s note\r\non this section: “Trente mille Macédoniens (dit Pauw) ont conquis la\r\nPerse; quarante mille Mogols ont conquis les Indes; cinquante mille\r\nTartares ont conquis la Chine, où l’on comptait alors plus de quarante\r\nmillions d’habitans, qui abandonnèrent leurs souverains. On a vu de nos\r\njours l’armée du grand Visir déserter presque complètement dans les\r\nenvirons de Varna; et jamais les Turcs n’eurent plus de bon sens qu’en\r\ncette occasion là; car leurs tyrans ne méritent pas qu’on verse une\r\nseule goutte de sang pour les maintenir sur le trône de ces contrées\r\nqu’ils ont dévastées en voleurs et en brigands. (Recherch. philosoph.\r\nsur les Grecs.)--Par ce dernier exemple on voit encore combien les\r\ncauses politiques ou morales, et les causes naturelles, peuvent se\r\nmodifier réciproquement. Les Russes, quoique soumis à un gouvernement\r\ndespotique, ont cependant été la terreur des Turcs, à cause, sans doute\r\nde la différence du climat, de la discipline militaire, et des progrès\r\ndans la civilisation. Ces circonstances ont concouru à mitiger le\r\ndespotisme Russe, et à le rendre si différent du despotisme brutal des\r\nTurcs. Il en est de même des autres peuples Septentrionaux de l’Europe.\r\nQuoique gouvernés par des loix qui ne sont point leur ouvrage, ils sont\r\ntrès belliqueux, et par la nature de leur climat, et par les lumières\r\nque les sciences et les arts ont répandues parmi eux.”\r\n\r\n[452] Aristotle, in drawing the traits of the European and Asiatic\r\ncharacter, would appear to have borrowed freely from our author. He\r\nsays the inhabitants of cold countries and of Europe are full of\r\nspirit, but deficient in intellect and skill; they therefore remain\r\nin a state of freedom, but without regular government, and they are\r\nincapable of governing their neighbors. The inhabitants of Asia are\r\ndescribed by him as being intellectual and skilled in the arts, but\r\ndeficient in courage, and therefore they are in constant subjection and\r\nslavery. The Greeks, he maintains, held an intermediate place between\r\nthese two, have both courage and intellect, and therefore enjoy freedom\r\nand good government. (Polit., iii., 7.)\r\n\r\n[453] We have lately had a notable example of the warlike and\r\nindependent spirit of mountaineers in the determined resistance which\r\nthe Circassians have made to the colossal power of Russia. Great\r\nBritain, too, I may be permitted to remark, experienced disasters in\r\ncontending with the mountaineers of Affganistan, such as she had never\r\nmet with in the rich plains of India. And, by the way, the conqueror of\r\nGreece and of Persia was very nearly cut off by the same people. See\r\nArrian, Exped. Alexandr., iv., 22, etc.\r\n\r\n[454] Ἄναρθροι. The meaning of this term seems to be, persons whose\r\njoints are indistinct owing to fatness.\r\n\r\n[455] Coray supposes, and apparently with justice, that our author\r\nin this passage tacitly refers to the inhabitants of Attica. It is\r\nworthy of remark that Thucydides ascribes the early civilization of the\r\nAthenians to the infertility of the soil. (Ἀττίκην λεπτόγεων, i., 2.)\r\nSee Arnold’s Note, h., 1.; also the quotation from Aristotle at § 23;\r\nand Plato’s Timæus, tom. iii., p. 247; ed. Bekker. According to Coray\r\n(but perhaps he was partially disposed towards his adopted country),\r\nthe characters of Provence and Marseilles are analogous to those of\r\nAttica and Athens, and the effects on the inhabitants similar. That\r\nMarseilles was at one time a flourishing seat of learning is undoubted;\r\nsee Tacitus (Agricola) and Strabo (Geogr., iii.); but in literary\r\ncelebrity it cannot surely aspire to be put on a level with the region\r\nwhich produced an Æschylus, a Thucydides, a Plato, and a Demosthenes!\r\nAnd it may be doubted whether even the Marseillais Hymn equals in\r\nmasculine energy the war songs of Tyrtæus!\r\n\r\n[456] Its title is, Specimen Historico-Medicum Inaugurale de\r\nHippocratis Doctrina a Prognostice Oriunda. Lugduni Batavorum, 1832.\r\n\r\n[457] Cap. v.\r\n\r\n[458] Comment. in Prognos. ap. Dietz.\r\n\r\n[459] The opinion here advanced is expressed with great precision\r\nby a French writer who has been making some figure in the political\r\nworld of late. “Great men,” says Louis Blanc, “only govern society\r\nby means of a force which they themselves borrow. They enlighten the\r\nworld only by a burning focus of all the scattered rays emanating from\r\nitself.”--Organization of Labor, p. 98, English edition.\r\n\r\n[460] Ascarus, a Theban statuary for one. See Pausanias, v., 24, 1.\r\n\r\n[461] See the Commentary of Simplicius. As I quote from memory I cannot\r\nrefer to the page.\r\n\r\n[462] Galen, in his Commentary on this clause of the sentence, acutely\r\nremarks that patients are justly disposed to form a high opinion of a\r\nphysician who points out to them symptoms of their complaint which they\r\nthemselves had omitted to mention to him. And Stephanus further remarks\r\nthat the patient naturally estimates highly the acumen of the physician\r\nwho detects any errors in regimen which he has been guilty of, such as\r\ndrinking water, or eating fruit when forbidden; (Ed. Dietz, p. 54;) or\r\nwhen he has some disease about him, such as bubo or inflammation, which\r\nhe wishes to conceal. (Ibid., p. 63.)\r\n\r\n[463] It has puzzled all the commentators, ancient and modern, to\r\nexplain satisfactorily why Hippocrates, in this place, seems to adopt\r\nthe popular creed, and acknowledge that a certain class of diseases are\r\nof divine origin; whilst in his treatises “On Airs,” etc., and “On the\r\nSacred Disease” he combats this doctrine as being utterly unfounded.\r\nGalen attempts to get over the difficulty by supposing that, in this\r\nplace, by divine our author means diseases connected with the state of\r\nthe atmosphere; this, however, would merely imply that, on the present\r\noccasion, he expressed himself in accordance with the popular belief.\r\nAnd, by the way, I would beg leave to remark that the plague which is\r\ndescribed by Homer in the exordium to the Iliad, and is referred to the\r\nwrath of a god, that is to say, of Apollo, was at the same time held\r\nby Eustathius and other commentators to be connected with the state\r\nof the atmosphere; that is to say, agreeably to the vulgar belief,\r\nepidemical diseases were looked upon as divine. See also Stephanus,\r\nthe commentator, t. i., p. 77; ed. Dietz. M. Littré has given, from a\r\nMS. in the Royal (National?) Library at Paris, a gloss never before\r\npublished, which contains an interesting extract from one of the\r\nearly Hippocratic commentators, Xenophon of Cos, bearing upon this\r\npassage. It is to this effect, that Bacchius, Callimachus, Philinus,\r\nand Heraclides Terentinus, supposed that by divine, in this place, was\r\nmeant pestilential, because the pestilence was held to be from god; but\r\nthat Xenophon, the acquaintance of Praxagoras, reckoned the nature of\r\nthe critical days divine; for, as to persons in a storm, the appearance\r\nof the gods Dioscuri brings safety, so do the critical days bring life\r\nto men in disease. (Opera, tom. i., p. 76.) See some remarks on this\r\nscholium by Grote, Hist. of Greece, vol. i., p. 488. On the θεῖον of\r\nHippocrates see further Berends, Lect. in Aphor., p. 349.\r\n\r\n[464] It will be remarked that, in his sketch of Prognosis (πρόνοια),\r\nin this place our author uses the term with considerable latitude; in\r\nfact, it comprehends the past, the present, and the future condition\r\nof the patient. Hippocrates, in a word, appears to have desired\r\nthat the physician should be in his line what his contemporary,\r\nThucydides, describes Themistocles to have been as a statesman: “Quod\r\nde instantibus (ut ait Thucydides), verissime judicabat, et de futuris\r\ncallidissime conjiciebat.”--Cornelius Nepos, in vita Themistocles. See\r\nalso Thucydides, i., 138. Probably both these writers had in his mind\r\nthe character of the prophet as drawn by Homer: Ὃς ᾔδη τά τ' ἕοντα τά\r\nτ' ἐσσόμενα πρό τ' ἔοντα.. (Iliad i.)\r\n\r\n[465] The groundwork of the matters contained in this section is to be\r\nfound in the Coacæ Prænotiones, 212; but it is greatly expanded and\r\nimproved by our author. I need scarcely remark that the description of\r\nthe features of a dying man is of classical celebrity. It is given in\r\nelegant prose by Celsus, ii., 6; and by Lucretius it is thus put into a\r\npoetical form:\r\n\r\n            “Item ad supremum denique tempus\r\n    Compressæ nares, nasi primoris acumen\r\n    Tenue, cavati oculi, cava tempora, frigida pellis\r\n    Duraque, inhorrebat rictum, frons tenta minebat.”\r\n                                      De Rerum Natura, vi., 1190.\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s description of the death of Falstaff, by the way,\r\ncontains images which have always appeared to me to be borrowed (at\r\nsecond-hand, no doubt) from this and other passages of the present\r\nwork: “For after I saw him fumble with the sheets, and play with\r\nflowers, and smile upon his fingers’-ends, I knew there was but one\r\nway: for his nose was as sharp as a pin, and he babbled of green\r\nfields.--So he bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my hand into\r\nthe bed and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone,” etc.--Henry\r\nV., ii., 3. Although perhaps it may be thought rather hypercritical,\r\nI cannot omit the present opportunity of making the remark, that it\r\nappears to me rather out of character to make the wandering mind of a\r\nLondon debauchee dwell upon images “of green fields.” One would have\r\nthought that “the ruling passion strong in death” would have rather\r\nsuggested stews and pot-houses to the imagination of such a person.\r\n\r\n[466] It will be remarked that our author modifies his judgment on\r\nthe result of the _ensemble_ of dangerous symptoms which he has\r\njust described, provided they be connected with want of food and of\r\nrest, or with looseness of the bowels. See Galen’s Commentary on this\r\npassage. Celsus renders this clause of the sentence as follows: “Si ita\r\nhæc sunt, ut neque vigilia præcesserit, neque ventris resolutio, neque\r\ninedia.”--ii., 6. I may briefly mention that both Galen and Stephanus\r\nseem to have understood this passage as I have translated it. Littré it\r\nwill be seen has rendered it somewhat differently.\r\n\r\n[467] The prognostics, drawn from the position in which the patient is\r\nfound reclining, are mostly taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 497. As\r\nusual, however, Hippocrates has improved very much the materials which\r\nhe avails himself of.\r\n\r\nI would here point out a mistake which most of the modern translators\r\nhave committed respecting the meaning of an expression contained in\r\nthis paragraph. It is καὶ τὸ ξύμπαν σῶμα ὑγρον κείμενον, which Clifton,\r\nMoffat, and even Littré understand as descriptive of the body’s being\r\nin a moist state with sweat. Littré’s translation is, “Le corps entier\r\nen moiteur.” The translators forget that the word ὑγρὸν is used by the\r\nbest classical authors to signify “relaxed” or “soft.” Thus Pindar,\r\nin his celebrated description of the eagle perched upon the sceptre\r\nof Jupiter, and lulled asleep by the power of music (every English\r\nscholar will remember Gray’s version of it in his Ode on the Progress\r\nof Poesy), has the expression ὑγρὸν νῶτον, which Heyne interprets\r\nby _flexile_ and _lubricum_. (Ad Pyth., 1.) See also the\r\nScholiast, in h. 1. Galen apprehends the meaning of the term as I have\r\nstated it: thus he defines it as applying to the position intermediate\r\nbetween complete extension and complete flexion, that is to say,\r\nhalf-bent or relaxed. Foës also renders the expression correctly by\r\n“corpus molliter positum.” (Œconom. Hippocrat.) See also Stephanus\r\n(p. 96, ed. Dietz), who decidedly states that the epithet (ὑγρὸς), in\r\nthis place, means slightly bent or relaxed. Heurnius explains ὑγρὸν as\r\nsignifying “molliter decumbens,” p. 189. Celsus renders the words in\r\nquestion by “cruribus paulum reductis,” ii., 3.\r\n\r\n[468] This is taken pretty closely from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 235.\r\n\r\n[469] This sentence is thus translated by Celsus: “Ubi ulcus, quod aut\r\nante, aut in ipso morbo natum est, aridum, et aut pallidum, aut lividum\r\nfactum est.” (ii., 6.) It is imitated from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 496.\r\n\r\n[470] This graphic description of the movement of the hands in delirium\r\nis nearly original, being but slightly touched upon in the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, 76. The terms are copied by most of the ancient authors\r\nsubsequent to Hippocrates, in their descriptions of phrenitis and\r\nfebrile delirium. See in particular PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book III.,\r\n6. Stephanus, in his Commentary, has several very philosophical remarks\r\non this passage, namely, upon the rationale of the ocular deception\r\nwhich leads to these extraordinary movements of the hands. (Ed. Dietz,\r\nt. i., pp. 103, 104.)\r\n\r\n[471] This is imitated pretty closely from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 260.\r\nDr. Ermerins remarks that there is a greater number of symptoms in the\r\nPrænotiones than in the Prognostics. He therefore suggests the question\r\nwhether there may not be a lacuna in the text. The description of the\r\nrespiration preceding dissolution in the Prænotiones is certainly\r\nmost graphic, and it appears wonderful that it should be omitted by\r\nHippocrates in the Prognostics.\r\n\r\n[472] The paragraph on sweats is founded on the Coacæ Prænotiones, 572,\r\n573; but the Prognostics is much fuller than the other. The cold sweats\r\ndescribed in this paragraph were called syncoptic by the ancients, and\r\nwere supposed to be connected with atony of the pores of the skin. See\r\nGalen, h. 1., and De Causis Sympt. iii., 9. Stephanus, with rather too\r\nmuch logical parade, gives a good many acute and interesting remarks on\r\nthis passage. He says that cold sweats are connected with a complete\r\nprostration of the innate heat (calidum innatum). (p. 114.)\r\n\r\n[473] The characters of the hypochondriac region are copied in part\r\nfrom the Coacæ Prænotiones, 279, 280, 282; but they are much improved\r\nin the Prognostics. It will be remarked that in the Epidemics great\r\nattention is paid to the state of the hypochondria. Stephanus remarks\r\nthat pulsation _or_ palpitation in the hypochondria is caused by\r\nviolent throbbing of the aorta as it passes through this region, which\r\nis occasioned by the effervescence and inflammation of the important\r\nparts which are situated in it, and with which the brain is apt to\r\nsympathize. (p. 118.) Meteorism of the hypochondriac region is often\r\nmentioned in the reports of the cases described in the Epidemics.\r\n\r\n[474] The author evidently alluded to hepatitis ending in abscess. This\r\nwould seem to have been a very common termination of inflammation of\r\nthe liver in Greece, as it is often described in the ancient medical\r\nworks. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., 46, and the authorities\r\nquoted there in the Sydenham Society’s edition.\r\n\r\n[475] The paragraph on the prognostics relating to dropsies is founded\r\nin a great measure on the Coacæ Prænotiones, 454. The ancient writers\r\nwho treat systematically of dropsy generally describe four varieties\r\nof it, namely, dropsy from disease of the liver, from disease of the\r\nspleen, from fever, and from a sudden draught of cold water. See De\r\nMorbis, and PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., 48, Sydenham Society’s\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[476] On this variety I have remarked in the Comment. on Paulus\r\nÆgineta: “Hippocrates refers one species of dropsy to disease of the\r\nparts situated in the loins, by which Galen and Stephanus agree that\r\nhe means the jejunum, mesaraic veins, and kidneys.” (Paulus Ægineta,\r\nl. c.) M. Littré accordingly holds it probable that allusion is made\r\nto granular degeneration of the kidneys, that is to say, to Bright’s\r\ndisease. (Opera, etc., tom. ii., 388.)\r\n\r\n[477] Dr. Ermerins remarks that the species of dropsy here described\r\nwas most probably connected with organic disease of the parts situated\r\nin the abdominal region, arising from inflammation with which they had\r\nbeen previously attacked.\r\n\r\n[478] This paragraph is pretty closely taken from the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, 492. A good deal of stress is laid upon the state of the\r\ntemperature of the extremities in the reports of the febrile cases\r\ncontained in the Epidemics. He announces it as a general truth that\r\ncoldness of the extremities in acute diseases is bad. (Aphor. vii., 1.)\r\nSprengel considers that he has stated this fact in too general terms,\r\nas there are many exceptions to it. (Hist. de la Méd., tom. i., 317.)\r\n\r\n[479] This is taken in part from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 493. Sprengel\r\nfinds great fault with Hippocrates for laying it down as a rule, that\r\nin cases of gangrene a black color of the part is less dangerous than\r\na livid. Dr. Ermerins, however, espouses the side of Hippocrates,\r\nand maintains that our author has acutely pointed out the difference\r\nbetween gangrene proving critical, and gangrene connected with weakness\r\nof the vital actions in the part. In the former case the part becomes\r\nperfectly black, whereas in the other it is livid. He mentions that\r\nhe observed in an hospital at the same time a case of mortification\r\nfrom cold, and another of the same from want and congelation; that in\r\nthe former the part was black, and the patient recovered; whilst in\r\nthe other the arms were livid, and the patient soon died. (Specimen\r\nHist. Med., p. 68.) Stephanus, by the way, gives nearly the same\r\nexplanation of this remark. (p. 142.) Perhaps our author had in view\r\nthe plague of Athens, in which the disease often terminated favorably\r\nin mortification of the fingers or toes. (Thucyd., ii., 49.)\r\n\r\n[480] A considerable portion of the Prognostics from Sleep are taken\r\nfrom the Coacæ Prænotiones, 497. This part is elegantly rendered\r\nby Celsus: “Ubi nocturna vigilia premitur, etiamsi interdiu somnus\r\naccedit; ex quo tamen pejor est, qui inter quartam horum et noctem\r\nest, quam qui matutino tempore ad quartam. Pessimum tamen est, si\r\nsomnus neque noctu, neque interdiu accedit; id enim fere sine continuo\r\ndolore esse non potest.” (ii., 4.) Stephanus gives a philosophical\r\ndisquisition on the nature and causes of sleep. (pp. 142–8.)\r\n\r\n[481] This is pretty closely taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 601.\r\n\r\n[482] A small part of this is to be found in the Coacæ Prænotiones, 609.\r\n\r\n[483] Part of this is borrowed from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 601.\r\n\r\n[484] Strigmentosa: that is to say, resembling the scrapings _or_\r\nstrippings of the bowels.\r\n\r\n[485] This in part is borrowed from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 604, 631.\r\n\r\n[486] This is pretty closely copied from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 495.\r\n\r\n[487] This is taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 281. Several of the\r\nother ancient writers on medicine, both Greek and Arabian, have\r\ntreated fully on the characters of the alvine discharges; but, upon\r\nthe whole, have not added much to the information contained in the\r\nCoacæ Prænotiones and Prognostics. See the Commentary on PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, B. II., 13. Stephanus has many interesting observations\r\non the prognostics from the urine. He remarks that the urine is a good\r\nindex of the condition which the digestive process is in, and more\r\nespecially the process of sanguification. (p. 162.)\r\n\r\n[488] This is closely copied from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 575.\r\n\r\n[489] According to Stephanus, both the farinaceous and leafy sediments\r\nare the products of a melting of the solid parts, as a consequence of\r\ninflammatory heat. (p. 165.)\r\n\r\n[490] A small portion of the above occurs in the Coacæ Prænotiones, 578.\r\n\r\n[491] For part of this our author is indebted to the Coacæ Prænotiones,\r\n580.\r\n\r\n[492] See Coacæ Prænotiones, 582.\r\n\r\n[493] This is partly taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 577.\r\n\r\n[494] Galen, in his Commentary, justly praises Hippocrates for the\r\nacuteness of the remark contained in this sentence, since both with\r\nregard to the urinary and fecal discharges, it must be highly important\r\nto determine whether their characters be indicative of the condition\r\nof the general system, or of the viscus by which they are secreted.\r\n(Opera, v., p. 142; ed. Basil.) The ancients paid great attention\r\nto the characters of the urine in disease, and their knowledge of\r\nthe subject will be admitted, even at the present day, to have been\r\nremarkable. The works of some of the later authorities, particularly of\r\nTheophilus and Actuarius, are well deserving of an attentive perusal.\r\nSee PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., p. 225.\r\n\r\n[495] This is partly taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 556.\r\n\r\n[496] These characters of the sputa are partly borrowed from the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, 390, 399.\r\n\r\n[497] They are founded on the Coacæ Prænotiones, 390, 391.\r\n\r\n[498] This is taken in part from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 302, 304.\r\nThe succeeding paragraphs on empyema are also partly derived from\r\nthe Coacæ Prænotiones, 393, 402, 428. I may be allowed to remark\r\nin this place that modern pathologists are agreed that abscesses\r\nafter pneumonia are of rare occurrence; at the same time, however,\r\npurulent infiltration and its natural consequence, expectoration of\r\npus, are not so very uncommon results of the disease. True pulmonary\r\nabscess or empyema is commonly occasioned by chronic inflammation. I\r\nam inclined to think that the ancients applied the term also to the\r\ncavities in the lungs produced by the softening of tubercles. It is\r\ndifficult otherwise to account for the frequent mention of empyemata\r\nin the works of the ancient authorities on medicine, especially\r\nin the Hippocratic treatises. See De Locis in Homine, p. 415, ed.\r\nFoës; and tom. i., p. 306, ed. Kühn, et alibi. M. Littré makes the\r\nfollowing remarks on the descriptions of empyema which occur in the\r\nHippocratic treatises: “On remarquera dans le _Pronostic_, et\r\ncette remarque s’étend à plusieurs autres des écrits Hippocratiques,\r\nqu’une très-large place est faite aux affections de la poitrine,\r\npéripneumonies et pleurésies. Il paraîtrait que, sous le climat de\r\nla Grèce, ces affections ont une grande fréquence, plus peut-être\r\nqu’elles n’en ont même dans notre climat. La description, fort abrégée\r\nil est vraie, qu’en donne Hippocrate, me porte à penser que, si cette\r\ndescription est exacte, elles ne suivent pas la même marche que parmi\r\nnous. En effet, que sont ces empyèmes que, suivant Hippocrate, se font\r\njour an dehors sous forme d’expectoration purulente? On peut croire,\r\nque dans les dénominations d’empyèmes sont compris les épanchements\r\npleurétiques; mais les épanchements pleurétiques ne se font pas jour au\r\ndehors, ils se guérissent par résorption; alors, que sont ces empyèmes\r\nsignalés par Hippocrate, comme terminaison des péripneumonies, et ces\r\nexpectorations qui en procurent l’evacuation? Il m’est impossible de\r\nrépondre à ces questions: peut-être des observations faites dans la\r\nGrèce même, permettraient de résoudre la difficulté.” (Œuvres Complets\r\nd’Hippocrate, tom. ii., p. 97.) Perhaps, as I have hinted above, the\r\nmost probable answer that could be returned to the questions put by M.\r\nLittré would be, that many of the cases of pneumonia terminating in\r\nempyema, which occur in the Hippocratic treatises, were what are now\r\ndescribed as cases of acute phthisis. See Louis on Phthisis, ii., 2.\r\nIn confirmation of my supposition that many of the cases of empyema\r\ndescribed by the ancients were, in fact, cases of phthisis, I would\r\nrefer to PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., 32, where it will be seen\r\nthat the two diseases, phthisis and empyema, are treated of under the\r\nsame head. See also the second book of the Prorrhetics, tom. i., pp.\r\n198–201; ed. Kühn.\r\n\r\nM. Littré reverts to this subject in the Argument to the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, tom. v., p. 576, where he relates, from two recent\r\nauthorities, a case of empyema after pleurisy, and another after\r\npneumonia, in both of which the pus was evacuated by the mouth. He also\r\nquotes the remark of an English writer, Dr. Twining, that, in and about\r\nBengal, abscess of the lungs after pneumonia is by no means very rare.\r\nStill M. Littré admits that the paucity of such cases in modern works\r\nmust lead to the conclusion either that Hippocrates had not observed\r\ncorrectly, or that this termination is more rare now than formerly. I\r\nleave the reader to judge whether my suggestion stated above does not\r\nremove this difficulty.\r\n\r\n[499] The observations of Andral have in some measure confirmed the\r\nopinion of Hippocrates and other authors, ancient and modern, that\r\nthere are certain days in the duration of the disease in which there\r\nis a greater tendency to amelioration. Of ninety-three cases, he found\r\ntwenty-three give way on the seventh, thirteen on the eleventh, eleven\r\non the fourteenth, and nine on the twentieth days. The recoveries in\r\nthe remaining cases commenced on twelve out of forty-two non-critical\r\ndays, as many as eleven being ascribed to the tenth day. Thus the\r\nrecoveries on critical days averaged as high as fourteen, while those\r\non non-critical scarcely exceeded three. (Dr. C. J. B. Williams on\r\nPneumonia, Cyclop. of Pract. Med., vol. iii., p. 405.) See also Andral,\r\nClin. Med., c. ii., p. 365.\r\n\r\n[500] Stephanus has a lengthened and most important commentary on this\r\npassage, containing an elaborate disquisition on empyema. (pp. 184–91.)\r\n\r\n[501] This is taken pretty closely from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 395.\r\n\r\n[502] A part of this is copied from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 396.\r\n\r\n[503] It will be seen in our analysis of several of the Hippocratic\r\ntreatises, such as De Affect. Intern., De Morbis, etc., that it was\r\nthe common practice in such cases to evacuate the matter either by the\r\ncautery or the knife. See also Aphorism, vii., 44.\r\n\r\n[504] Part of this is borrowed from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 108.\r\n\r\n[505] This is in part derived from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 471. Galen,\r\nin his commentary, is at pains to explain that by a hard bladder\r\nHippocrates means a bladder in a state of inflammation.\r\n\r\n[506] The subject of the critical days is not touched upon in the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, so that the contents of this section are either original\r\nor taken from some source with which we are totally unacquainted.\r\nGalen, indeed, does not hesitate to declare that Hippocrates himself\r\nwas the first who treated of the critical days; but whether he had\r\nany competent authority for pronouncing this opinion cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily determined. The critical days are incidentally treated\r\nof in the Epidemics and Aphorisms; but, as we have stated in our\r\ncritique on the Hippocratic treatises in the Preliminary Discourse,\r\nthe work “On Critical Days” is in all probability spurious. The system\r\nof the critical days taught by Hippocrates was adopted by almost all\r\nthe ancient authorities, with the exception of Archigenes and his\r\nfollowers, who, however, were not numerous nor of any great name, with\r\nthe exception of Celsus. See the Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nB. II., 7, Syd. Soc. edition.\r\n\r\n[507] The contents of this section are borrowed in a great measure from\r\nthe Coacæ Prænotiones, 160. Dr. Ermerins remarks that the headache here\r\ndescribed is probably of a catarrhal or rheumatic nature. (Specimen\r\nHist. Med. Inaug., etc., p. 84.)\r\n\r\n[508] This is taken in great measure from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 189.\r\nGalen in his commentary, remarks that patients die of violent pains of\r\nthe ear, owing to the brain sympathizing, which brings on delirium, and\r\nsometimes occasions sudden death. I may be allowed to remark that every\r\nexperienced physician must have met with such cases.\r\n\r\n[509] A considerable part of this section on ulcerated sore-throat is\r\nextracted from the Coacæ Prænotiones. The present sentence is from\r\n§ 276. The medical reader will not fail to remark that Hippocrates\r\ndisplays a wonderfully accurate acquaintance with these affections.\r\n\r\n[510] This is founded on the contents of the Coacæ Prænotiones, 363.\r\nThe disease here described is evidently angina laryngæa.\r\n\r\n[511] This is taken in part from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 364. As Dr.\r\nErmerins remarks in his note on it, the disease here described is\r\nevidently angina pharyngæa.\r\n\r\n[512] This is closely copied from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 365. The\r\ndanger of erythematous swelling being determined inwards, is well\r\nunderstood nowadays.\r\n\r\n[513] This is taken, with slight alterations, from the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, 365, 367. The latter clause is more fully expressed in\r\nthe Coacæ Prænotiones than in the Prognostics. “In those cases in\r\nwhich cynanche is determined to the lungs, some die in seven days, and\r\nsome escaping these get into a state of empyema, unless they have a\r\npituitous expectoration.” This is evidently a correct description of\r\nthe disease spreading to the lungs.\r\n\r\n[514] No part of this last clause is to be found in the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones. The operations of excising and burning the diseased uvula\r\nare minutely described by Paulus Ægineta and other of the ancient\r\nauthorities. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. VI., 31. I need scarcely\r\nremark that both these operations have been revived of late years.\r\n\r\n[515] This is taken with little variation from the Coacæ Prænotiones,\r\n146.\r\n\r\n[516] A part of what precedes is taken from the Coacæ Prænotiones, 143;\r\nall that follows, with the exception of a short sentence, is original.\r\n\r\n[517] Our author here and elsewhere impresses it upon his readers that\r\nit is from the _tout ensemble_ of the symptoms that a judgment\r\nis to be formed in every case. This is evidently a remark of the most\r\nvital importance in forming a prognosis. Galen’s observations in the\r\nsucceeding commentary are very interesting, and deserve an attentive\r\nperusal.\r\n\r\n[518] That is to say, the physician ought to get speedily acquainted\r\nwith the nature of the epidemics which prevail at every particular\r\nseason. I need scarcely remark that this is a subject which is\r\nlargely treated of in the works of our English Hippocrates, Sydenham.\r\nHippocrates himself is very full on this head, more especially in his\r\nEpidemics and Aphorisms, as we shall see below.\r\n\r\n[519] It has excited a great deal of discussion and difference of\r\nopinion to determine what our author means by specifying these three\r\nplaces; but the explanation given by Galen in his Commentary seems to\r\nme quite satisfactory. According to him, the meaning of our author is\r\nthat good and bad symptoms tell the same in all places, in the hot\r\nregions of Libya, the cold of Scythia, and the temperate of Delos. It\r\nis further to be borne in mind that Odessus in Scythia, and Cyrene in\r\nLibya, were the extremities of the Grecian world, whilst Delos may be\r\nregarded as its centre. It is proper to remark, however, that by the\r\nthree places mentioned, Erotian understands the three quarters of the\r\nearth--Africa, Asia, and Europe. See under Λιβύη.\r\n\r\n[520] The meaning of this last sentence has been supposed to be\r\nsomewhat ambiguous; but to me it appears evidently to be this, that\r\nthe rules of prognosis, as laid down above, apply to all diseases of\r\nan acute character, whether their names happen to be mentioned in the\r\ncourse of this work or not, so that it should not be considered a\r\ndefect in the work that any one is omitted.\r\n\r\n[521] See Epidem., i., and iii.\r\n\r\n[522] Empyema is treated of in the Prognostics, the first book of\r\nProrrhetics, the Coacæ Prænotiones, and the work De Morbis. Which of\r\nthese is here alluded to cannot be determined for certain; it seems\r\nprobable, however, that it is to the preceding book of Prorrhetics.\r\n\r\n[523] This important observation is thus rendered by Celsus: “Quæ in\r\nlatere linguæ ulcera nascuntur diutissimè durant. Videndumque est, num\r\ncontra dens aliquis acutior sit, qui sanescere sæpe ulcus eo loco non\r\nsinit, ideoque limandus est.” (vi., 12.)\r\n\r\n[524] Allusion seems to be made to herpes exedens.\r\n\r\n[525] See PAULUS ÆGINETA, B. III., 25.\r\n\r\n[526] Foës inclines to think that the proper reading in this place\r\nis νοὔσος φοινικίη, and not φθινικὴ, and that Galen alludes to this\r\npassage in his Exegesis under the former of these terms, where he\r\nsays that by φοινικίη νοῡσος was probably meant elephantiasis. The\r\nother reading, however, would seem quite applicable, for I have known\r\nphthisis and leprosy combined in the same case.\r\n\r\n[527] The phrenitis of Sydenham in like manner was an epidemical fever,\r\nand not an idiopathic inflammation of the brain. See Opera, p. 56; ed.\r\nSyd. Soc. That Hippocrates regarded phrenitis as a variety of causus,\r\nattended with determination to the brain, is obvious from Epidem. i.\r\nSee Op. Galen., tom. v., p. 371; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[528] Horace, Serm. i., 2.\r\n\r\n[529] One mode of exercise, namely, gestation, is to be excepted,\r\nwhich had at least one distinguished advocate in ancient times. Celsus\r\nwriting of it says, “Asclepiades etiam in recenti vehementique,\r\npræcipueque ardente febre, ad discutiendam eam, gestatione dixit\r\nutendum: sed id pericolose fit; meliusque quiete ejusmodi impetus\r\nsustinetur.” (ii., 15.) A great modern authority on fever, Dr. R.\r\nJackson, speaks favorably of this practice, although, as we see, it is\r\nso pointedly condemned by Celsus. Celsus, however, admits of gestation\r\nin that species of remittent fever which was called lethargus. (iii.,\r\n20.)\r\n\r\n[530] Observ. Med., vi., 3, 4.\r\n\r\n[531] The Cnidian Sentences in all probability were the results of the\r\nobservations and theories made in the Temple of Health at Cnidos. We\r\nmay reasonably conclude from what we know of them, that, like the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones at Cos, the Cnidian Sentences at Cnidos were looked up to\r\nin the time of Hippocrates as the great guides to medical practice.\r\nHow much, then, it is to be regretted that they have not come down\r\nto us like the other! It is clear, however, from Galen’s Commentary,\r\nthat the work was extant in his time, and from it, as will be seen,\r\nwe are enabled to draw a few particulars respecting the theoretical\r\nand practical views of the Cnidians. Le Clerc considers it likely that\r\nEuryphon was the author of the Cnidian Sentences (Hist. Phys., i., 3,\r\n30); but it is evident, from the terms in which Hippocrates refers\r\nto them, that they were not the work of a single author. He makes\r\nmention, it will be remarked, of more than one person being concerned\r\nin remodelling them.\r\n\r\n[532] By this our author means that the Cnidians neglected Prorrhetics\r\nand Prognostics. This must be obvious to every person who had entered\r\nproperly into the spirit of the Hippocratic system of medicine.\r\n\r\n[533] The text of this sentence is in a very unsatisfactory state, and\r\nmuch difference of opinion has prevailed respecting the meaning. See\r\nthe annotations of Littré, and the remarks of Galen, as quoted in the\r\nArgument.\r\n\r\n[534] Galen, in his Commentary, mentions that the Cnidians described\r\nseven species of diseased bile, and twelve diseases of the bladder;\r\nand, again, four diseases of the kidneys; and, moreover, four species\r\nof strangury, four species of tetanus, and four of jaundice; and,\r\nagain, three species of phthisis. Galen, having made this statement,\r\nremarks that they looked to the peculiarities of the body, instead of\r\nregarding the identity of the diatheses, as was done by Hippocrates.\r\nIn other words, they split diseases into endless varieties, instead\r\nof attending to the essence or general nature of each. The system\r\nof Hippocrates, then, was founded on a rational prognosis, whereas\r\nthat of the Cnidians was founded on mistaken principles of diagnosis.\r\nThe principles of the Hippocratic system are admirably explained and\r\ndeveloped in Galen’s great work On the Method of Cure, _or_\r\nTherapeutics.\r\n\r\n[535] Galen, in his Commentary on this passage, states that when a\r\ndisease of a mild character prevailed generally, it was called an\r\nepidemic; and when of a malignant nature, it was called the plague.\r\n(See further PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 36, Syd. Soc. edition.)\r\nIt will be remarked that I have included the word (_not_) in\r\nbrackets. This I have done because not only the reading, as given in\r\nthe common editions of Galen, is in its favor, but because the sense\r\nappears to me to require it. Surely when diseases are of an epidemic\r\ncharacter they are similar; but when they are sporadic, they are not\r\nsimilar. M. Littré, however, rejects it altogether.\r\n\r\n[536] The question here mooted is certainly one of the most important\r\nthat can well be entertained, namely, whether or not a certain portion\r\nof nutriment ought to be given to persons laboring under fever. It\r\nwould appear, from what is stated by Galen upon the authority of\r\nErasistratus, that the most diametrically opposite modes of practice\r\nhad been followed by different individuals--that some had starved\r\ntheir patients altogether for a considerable time; whereas, on the\r\nother hand, a physician of the name of Petronas allowed his patients\r\nflesh and wine. Our author, it will be remarked, does not allude to\r\nthese extreme modes of practice in this place, but enters at great\r\nlength into the question whether or not unstrained ptisan (_or_\r\nbarley gruel) should be administered in fevers, and, if so, under what\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[537] Galen, in his Commentary, has some very interesting remarks on\r\nthe differences of opinion among the diviners. This, in fact, may well\r\nbe supposed, since, as will now be pretty generally acknowledged, the\r\nwhole art was founded upon conjecture and deception. The comparison of\r\nmedicine to divination is therefore very discreditable to the former.\r\n\r\n[538] Our author now enters upon the consideration of one of his\r\nprincipal objects in the present work, namely, to describe the modes of\r\npreparing ptisan (_or_ the decoction of barley), and its uses in\r\nacute diseases. He is so full on this subject that the present treatise\r\nis quoted by Athenæus (Deipnos. ii., 16), by the name of the work On\r\nthe Ptisan. Galen states that, on the principle that diseases are to\r\nbe cured by their contraries, as the essence of a febrile disease is\r\ncombined of heat and dryness, the indication of cure is to use means\r\nof a cooling and moistening nature, and that the ptisan fulfils both\r\nthese objects. I may be allowed to remark in this place, that probably\r\nthere is not a more important rule in the whole practice of medicine\r\nthan this, that fevers are to be treated by things of a cooling and\r\ndiluent nature. I may mention further regarding the ptisan of the\r\nancients, that it would appear to have been very little different from\r\nthe decoction of barley, as now in use; that is to say, it was prepared\r\nfrom pearl-barley roughly pounded and boiled for a time in water. As\r\nwill be seen by the text, it was given to the sick either strained or\r\nentire, according to circumstances. A similar decoction was prepared\r\nfrom wheat, and was called πτιαάνη πυρίνη. See Galen (De Aliment., i.)\r\nThe simple term ptisan, however, is always to be understood as applying\r\nto the decoction of barley.\r\n\r\n[539] Galen gives the following illustration of what is meant by a\r\ndisease of a peculiarly dry nature. In pneumonia, pleurisy, and in all\r\nthe affections about the lungs and trachea, the disease is held to be\r\nof a dry nature when there is no expectoration from the parts affected;\r\nand in any complaints about the liver, the mesentery, the stomach, the\r\nsmall or great intestines, or spleen, when the belly is either entirely\r\nconstipated, or when the discharges brought away by artificial means\r\nare dry and scybalous; and diseases of the arteries and veins are known\r\nto be dry by the dryness of the tongue, and the parched appearance of\r\nthe whole body. In the same manner external ulcers are accounted dry\r\nwhen there is no discharge from them. And ophthalmies are held to be\r\ndry when there is no discharge from the eyes or nose. And, in short,\r\nall diseases are recognized as being dry which are not attended with\r\nany discharge.\r\n\r\n[540] It is curious to remark that a double charge was founded against\r\nour author on the ground of his treatment of febrile cases, as here\r\nlaid down. The followers of Thessalus held that he gorged his patients\r\nwith too much food, whereas Erasistratus and his followers held that\r\nhe starved them. Galen, on the other hand, contends that the practice\r\nof Hippocrates is the _juste milieu_ between these two extremes.\r\n(Opera, tom. v., p. 47; ed. Basil.)\r\n\r\n[541] This sentence shows that Hippocrates understood thoroughly\r\nthe proper treatment of pleurisy. When the disease did not yield to\r\nfomentations, but the pain continued, either a vein was opened or the\r\nbowels moved; for without first using these means, it was reckoned\r\nfatal practice to administer ptisan. Galen relates that it was also\r\nconsidered an unsafe practice to give opium, mandragora, or hyoscyamus\r\nfor the purpose of alleviating the pain, instead of having recourse\r\nto venesection or purging for the removal of it. This is a practical\r\nremark well deserving of the most serious consideration.\r\n\r\n[542] How briefly, and yet how graphically, our author has described\r\nthe termination of pleurisy! It is singular that no succeeding author\r\nhas written so learnedly of _râles_ in affections of the breast\r\nas Hippocrates, down at least to the time of Laennec, who repeatedly\r\nacknowledges his obligations to our author.\r\n\r\n[543] I need scarcely remark that the seasonable administration of\r\ndrink, and especially of water, is one of the most important points\r\nconnected with the treatment of febrile diseases. This is so much the\r\ncase that, as Galen remarks in his Commentary on this passage, fevers\r\nmay often be extinguished at once by a large quantity of water given\r\nin due season. This subject is fully treated of by him in his Methodus\r\nMedendi.\r\n\r\n[544] The professional reader will not fail to remark, what is pointed\r\nout in strong language by Galen, how judiciously our author commences\r\nwith the most gentle means, and gradually rises to the most powerful\r\nand dangerous; namely, bleeding and the administration of drastic\r\npurgatives. One cannot help being further struck with the rich supply\r\nof information which he has on the simple subject of fomentations.\r\n\r\n[545] By livid (πέλιον) is here meant the colour intermediate between\r\nred and black. See Galen, h. 1.\r\n\r\n[546] Probably the _Helleborus niger_. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III.,\r\np. 108.\r\n\r\n[547] The _Euphorbia peplus_. See Ibid., Vol. III., p. 294.\r\n\r\n[548] Probably the _Seseli tortuosum_. See Ibid., Vol. III., p. 330;\r\nand Dierbach, Arzn. der Hipp. p. 186.\r\n\r\n[549] A species of asafœtida, probably the _Laserpetium derias_. PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Vol. III., p. 339.\r\n\r\n[550] It is worthy of remark, that our author directs aromatics to be\r\nmixed with the purgatives. The reason for prescribing them, as Galen\r\nstates, was to counteract the bad effects of the purgatives upon the\r\nstomach. The ancients, in my opinion, acted much more wisely in this\r\nrespect than the moderns generally do, for the latter are constantly\r\nadministering the most nauseous cathartics to their patients without\r\ntaking any pains to obviate their bad effects upon the stomach. On the\r\nancient modes of administering purgatives, see PAULUS ÆGINETA,\r\nB. VII., 4.\r\n\r\n[551] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the common herd of\r\nphysicians followed the very opposite rule to that here laid down\r\nby Hippocrates, that is to say, they administered food copiously\r\nafter evacuations. According to Galen, the object of Hippocrates in\r\nproscribing food of all descriptions at that season is, because the\r\npowers of the system, being then weakened, are unable either to bear\r\nfood or to digest it.\r\n\r\n[552] See Celsus, I., 3.\r\n\r\n[553] The _cyceon_ was a mixture of various articles of food, but\r\ngenerally contained cheese, honey, and wine. See Athenæus (Deipnos,\r\nii.). It is described by Homer as the potion which Circe administered\r\nto the followers of Ulysses. (Odyss. x., 235). There is frequent\r\nmention of it in the Hippocratic treatises, as at De Diæta, ii.; de\r\nMuliebribus, ii.; and in the works of the other medical authors.\r\n\r\n[554] The meaning here is somewhat obscure, but appears to be this:\r\nthat if a patient fast for the first two or three days, and take food\r\nof a heavy nature on the fourth or fifth, he will be much injured, but\r\nthat the mistake will be still more fatal if the fast be continued for\r\nthe first four or five days, and if he then indulge freely in food at\r\nthe end of these.\r\n\r\n[555] There is considerable difficulty as to the text at this place.\r\nSee Foës in his Annotations and Œconomica, and a very lengthy note by\r\nLittré.\r\n\r\n[556] The preternatural mode of respiration here described is several\r\ntimes adverted to by Galen, as at De Dyspnœa, iii.; Comment. in Aphor.,\r\niv., 68; and Comment. in h. 1. Galen seems to understand the meaning to\r\nbe, that the breathing is intercepted in the inspiration. I should have\r\nrather been disposed to think that it is the expiration which is said\r\nto be interrupted. But I suppose we must bow to so great an authority\r\nas Galen! I may mention, by the way, that his Commentary on this and\r\nthe collateral passages of our author is most interesting; but, as\r\nusual, too diffuse for my narrow limits. It relates to a most important\r\npoint in medical practice, on which great ignorance and uncertainty\r\nprevail among us, even at the present day.\r\n\r\n[557] Galen finds the language in this last sentence so confused, that\r\nhe does not hesitate to declare that he is convinced the work must have\r\nbeen left by Hippocrates in an unfinished state, and not published\r\nuntil after his death. He decides that ἐφθότης signifies a heated\r\nstate connected with humors, and not with dryness; that is to say, a\r\ncondition analogous to boiling, and not to roasting.\r\n\r\n[558] Galen, in his elaborate Commentary on this section, complains\r\nthat our author’s account of wines is imperfect, inasmuch as several\r\nvarieties are omitted; at the same time it must be admitted that his\r\nobservations on this head are very much to the purpose, and highly\r\njudicious. For the other ancient authorities on this subject, see\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Book I., 95, Syd. Soc. edit.\r\n\r\n[559] I need scarcely mention that hydromel was a drink prepared by\r\nboiling honey in a large proportion of water. It was of different\r\ndegrees of strength; sometimes there were only two parts of water to\r\none of honey, and at other times from seven to eight parts were used\r\nSee PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book I., 96, Syd. Soc. edit.\r\n\r\n[560] Galen, in explanation, mentions that hydromel is of a detergent\r\nnature; and hence it clears out the air-passages, and thus promotes\r\nexpectoration. When the sputa are thick and viscid, it cuts and\r\nattenuates them. (Opera, tom. v., pp. 75, 76; ed. Basil.)\r\n\r\n[561] Although, as we have shown in our analysis of the treatise on\r\nthe Use of Liquids, Hippocrates and his followers were sufficiently\r\nliberal in the administration of water on proper occasions, it will be\r\nseen from the contents of this section that our author was by no means\r\ndisposed to give water freely in febrile diseases, nor in affections\r\nof the chest. Whatever may now be thought of his observations on this\r\npoint of practice, all must admit that they are deserving of high\r\nattention. Galen’s Commentary is also very interesting. It appears\r\nfrom it that he disapproved of giving water alone, but always added a\r\nsmall proportion of wine to it in order to give it a flavour. That the\r\nquantity of wine which was added to the water must have been small, is\r\nobvious from an anecdote which he relates in this place. He says that a\r\ncertain physician, who saw the insignificant amount of the wine which\r\nwas put into the water, said, bantering him, “Your patient will have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing the wine indeed, but will not be able to taste\r\nit.” Galen, however, contends that, although the quantity thus added be\r\nsmall, it is sufficient to act as a stomachic, and to obviate the bad\r\neffects which the water would otherwise produce. (Opera, tom. v., p.\r\n83; ed. Basil.) It will be perceived from the context, that Hippocrates\r\nintended to give a separate treatise on each particular disease, not\r\nconsidering the present work on general therapeutics sufficiently\r\nexplicit, as Galen remarks.\r\n\r\n[562] The smegma was an abstergent composition used by the ancients in\r\nbathing for the purpose of cleansing the skin. For a full account of\r\nthe smegmata, see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., pp. 536–41.\r\n\r\n[563] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the physicians usually\r\ndid not put their patients into the baths, but made use of the\r\n_douche_, or affusion of hot water. He adds, that persons in good\r\nhealth may leave the hot bath and plunge into the cold, but that this\r\npractice is not safe in the case of invalids. He recommends, then, that\r\nthere should be at hand a good supply of baths of various temperatures,\r\nso that the patient may gradually pass from one of a high to others\r\nof a low temperature. By the way, I have often wondered that Dr.\r\nCurrie, who certainly had no inconsiderable pretensions to classical\r\nscholarship, should have been so profoundly ignorant as he appears to\r\nhave been of the use of the warm affusion by Hippocrates and Galen in\r\nthe treatment of febrile diseases. His rival, Dr. Jackson, had a much\r\nmore respectable acquaintance with the ancient authorities on medicine;\r\nand I have often thought it was to be regretted that the profession at\r\nthat period, in giving a trial to the affusion of cold and hot water in\r\nfever, put itself under the leadership of Currie instead of Jackson.\r\n\r\n[564] Dr. Tweedie’s observations agree so well with those of\r\nHippocrates, that I will give the reader an opportunity of comparing\r\nthem together. “This organ (the stomach), in convalescence, partakes\r\nof the external or muscular debility, and the convalescent may as well\r\nexpect to be able to carry a heavy load on his shoulders as to digest\r\nan undue quantity of food, even of a suitable kind.” (p. 215.)\r\n\r\n[565] The directions given by that excellent authority Alexander\r\nTrallian, for the regulation of the regimen in phrenitis, are to the\r\nsame effect. Wine is to be given when there is much insomnolency, when\r\nthe strength is reduced, when the fever is no longer strong and ardent,\r\nand _when concoction appears already in the urine_. The author\r\nmakes the acute remark, that the remedy is attended with certain evil\r\nconsequences, but that it is the part of a prudent physician to balance\r\nthe good and bad effects, and administer the article in question when\r\nthe good preponderate. (i., 13.)\r\n\r\n[566] This can scarcely be supposed anything else than a wilful\r\nmisrepresentation of our author’s rule of practice in this case. See\r\nthe fourth section of the preceding part.\r\n\r\n[567] The causes _of_ ardent fever of the ancients was decidedly\r\nthe same as the bilious remittent fever of modern authors. See\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. I., p. 262. We shall find many cases\r\nof it related in the Epidemics. In fact the causus is the ordinary\r\nfever of Greece and other countries bordering upon the Mediterranean.\r\nGalen, in his Commentary on this section, mentions that he had known it\r\ngenerally superinduced by drinking wine after great fatigue in summer.\r\nThere can be no doubt that this was the fever of which Alexander the\r\nGreat died. The description of the disease in his case, as given by\r\nArrian from the Royal Journals (βασίλειοι ἑφημερίδες), has so much the\r\nair of truth, and withal appears to me so interesting, that I shall be\r\nexcused introducing it in this place. “And the Royal Journals ran thus:\r\nthat he drank at a jollification in the house of Medius; then rising\r\nup and being bathed, slept, and again supped with Medius, and again\r\ndrank until the night was far advanced; that giving over drinking he\r\nbathed; and having bathed, ate a little, and slept there, because he\r\nwas already feverish; that being carried on a little to the sacrifices,\r\nhe performed them according to his daily practice; that the sacrifices\r\nbeing performed, he reclined in the dining-room (ἀνδρὼν) until the\r\ndusk of evening, and there gave orders to the commander respecting\r\nthe march and voyage, that those who had to proceed on foot should be\r\nprepared for marching on the fourth day, and those who were to sail\r\non the fifth; that he was carried hence upon a couch to the river,\r\nand being placed in a boat was taken across the river to the garden,\r\nand then being again bathed, that he rested. Next day, that he again\r\nwas bathed and performed the appointed sacrifices; and going into a\r\nchamber, that he reclined and conversed with Medius, and gave orders\r\nto the commanders to meet him in the morning. That having done these\r\nthings, he took a little supper; and having been carried back to the\r\nchamber, that he was in a continued state of fever during the whole\r\nnight; that next day he bathed, and after the bath performed the\r\nsacrifices; that he gave orders to Nearchus and the other commanders\r\nrespecting the voyage, that it should take place on the third day;\r\nthat next day he bathed again, and performed the appointed sacrifices;\r\nthat the religious rites being over, he did not cease to be feverish,\r\nbut that calling the commanders he gave orders for having every thing\r\nin readiness for the voyage; that he was bathed next day, and being\r\nbathed was already in a bad state. That next day being carried to\r\nthe house adjoining the bath, he performed the appointed sacrifices;\r\nthat he was in a bad state, but yet that he called to him the chiefs\r\nof his commanders, and again gave orders respecting the voyage; that\r\nthe following day he was carried with difficulty to the religious\r\nrites and sacrificed, and that notwithstanding he gave orders to the\r\ncommanders respecting the voyage. That next day, although already in a\r\nbad state, he performed the appointed sacrifices; that he gave orders\r\nthat the commanders should watch in the saloon, and the chiliarchs and\r\npentacosiarchs before the doors; and that being altogether now in a\r\nbad state, he was carried from the garden to the palace. That when the\r\ncommanders came in he recognized them, but did not speak, being now\r\nspeechless; that he was in a bad state of fever during that night and\r\nday, and during another night and day. Thus it is written in the Royal\r\nJournals.” Thus far the report is no doubt to be strictly depended\r\nupon; the historical embellishments added to it from other sources can\r\nhave no interest to the professional reader. (Appiani Exped. Alexandr.,\r\nvii., 37.) It deserves to be remarked, as a remarkable feature in this\r\ncase, that the mind appears to have been pretty entire during the whole\r\ncourse of the fever. Now, this is one of the characteristics of causus\r\nas described by Aretæus (Morb. Acut., ii., 4). It is further one of the\r\nmost marked features of the yellow fever, which, from all I can learn\r\nof it, would appear decidedly to be an aggravated form of causus.\r\n\r\n[568] Galen admits that he did not understand the exact import of this\r\nterm.\r\n\r\n[569] This is a general rule of such importance that Galen wonders our\r\nauthor did not embody it in one of his Aphorisms. Galen’s observations\r\non venesection in this commentary, and in his two treatises on\r\nthis subject, are highly important. It will be remarked that three\r\ncircumstances are held to form indications of the necessity for\r\nbleeding: first, if the disease be of a strong nature; second, if the\r\npatient be in the vigor of life; and, third, if his strength be entire.\r\n\r\n[570] This section, as Galen remarks, contains a list of the principal\r\ncases in which venesection is to be had recourse to.\r\n\r\n[571] I need scarcely point out to the professional reader that these\r\nsymptoms are very descriptive of congestion in the brain, threatening\r\nan attack either of apoplexy or epilepsy. See the treatise on the\r\nSacred Disease.\r\n\r\n[572] Meaning apparently the great vessels. See Galen’s Commentary.\r\n\r\n[573] The description here given of cynanche, more especially of\r\nthe variety in which the ulceration spreads down to the trachea and\r\nproduces engorgement of the lungs, is most characteristic, and bespeaks\r\na great practical acquaintance with the disease. Judged of in a\r\nbecoming spirit of candor, it must be admitted that even at the present\r\nday we have scarcely made any advancement in our knowledge of this\r\nsubject. What are our descriptions of ulcerous sore-throat, diptherite,\r\nœdema glottidis, croup, and laryngismus stridulus, but reproductions\r\nin a divided and (may I be allowed to suggest?) a less accurate form,\r\nof the general views here presented by our author? For an abstract of\r\nthe views of the other ancient authorities in medicine, see PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Book III., 27. Aretæus deserves particularly to be\r\nconsulted (Morb. Acut., i., 7). It will be remarked that our author\r\nspeaks of a spontaneous determination to the skin, as being calculated\r\nto remove the urgent symptoms within. Galen, in commenting upon this\r\nclause, states that some physicians were in the practice of applying to\r\nthe skin certain medicines possessed of ulcerative powers, in order to\r\ndetermine to the surface, and thus imitate Nature’s mode of cure.\r\n\r\n[574] Though the contents of this section are by no means devoid of\r\ninterest, it must be obvious to the reader that the observations on\r\ncausus are out of place here. See the Commentary of Galen.\r\n\r\n[575] I would beg leave to direct the attention of the medical reader\r\nto the observations of our author in this and many other places on\r\nthe characters of the urine in fevers. That in febrile diseases the\r\nsediment is wanting previous to the crisis, and that at and after\r\nthe crisis, when favorable, the sediment becomes remarkably copious,\r\nI believe to be certain facts; and yet I question if, with all our\r\nboasted improvements in urology, they be generally known and attended\r\nto. I have called attention in the Argument to the important rule of\r\npractice which our author founds on the state of the urine at the\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n[576] He means by this, that the disease is not of an intermittent type.\r\n\r\n[577] This seems the most appropriate meaning in this place, but the\r\npassage may also signify “a state of great emphysema or meteorism.” See\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\n[578] It is impossible not to recognize here a brief sketch of\r\n_delirium tremens_. The trembling hands from drinking, with the\r\nsubsequent delirium, can leave no doubts on the subject. See further\r\nLittré, tom. ii., p. 382.\r\n\r\n[579] The fruit of the _pinus pinaster_. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III.,\r\np. 301.\r\n\r\n[580] It will be remarked, that in this place the author directs that\r\nthe bleeding should be carried to a greater extent than in the former\r\npart of this treatise. In general, the ancient authorities forbade the\r\nabstraction of blood until it induced lipothymia. This is decidedly the\r\nrule of practice laid down by Aretæus (De Curat. Morb. Acut., ii., 1).\r\n\r\n[581] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that this account of dysentery\r\nis vague, the species of dysentery here alluded to not being properly\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n[582] This case is vague and undefined. I suppose the author alludes to\r\nopisthotonos in this sentence, and to emprosthotonos in the succeeding\r\npart of this section.\r\n\r\n[583] _Bryonia dioica._ See Dierbach, etc., p. 131.\r\n\r\n[584] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the modes of solution in\r\nfevers are not completely given in this place; for example, our author\r\nomits those by the uterus and the nose.\r\n\r\n[585] The text is in a very unsettled state.\r\n\r\n[586] The substance of this section occurs in the preceding part of\r\nthis work, which certainly amounts to a strong presumption that the\r\npresent treatise is not genuine. Very similar views are also laid down\r\nin the treatise On Ancient Medicine.\r\n\r\n[587] On the Dietetics of the ancients, see the Commentary on\r\nPAULUS ÆGINATA, Vol. I., pp. 106–86.\r\n\r\n[588] By dry cholera would seem to be meant flatulent colic. See\r\nGalen’s Commentary. It is also described below, and further with great\r\naccuracy by Alexander Trallian (vii., 16).\r\n\r\n[589] Galen, in his Commentary on this section, finds many things\r\nimperfectly stated, and therefore unworthy of his great author. For\r\nexample, he remarks, only two varieties of dropsy are mentioned,\r\nnamely, anasarca and tympanites; whereas there are three at least,\r\nand some even describe four varieties. By the three kinds of dropsy,\r\nGalen and the other ancient authorities meant anasarca, ascites,\r\nand tympanitis. (See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book III., 48). That\r\ntympanites should have been ranked with dropsy need excite no wonder,\r\nwhen we consider the resemblance of this affection to ascites. In fact\r\nI have known cases of tympanites in which paracentesis was performed\r\nby inexperienced surgeons under the impression that they were cases\r\nof ascites. See some elaborate annotations on this head by Ermerins\r\n(Specimen Hist. Med., p. 125), and by Littré (Op. Hippocrat., tom.\r\niv., p. 415). With regard to venesection in dropsy, Galen remarks that\r\nthe rule of practice is not laid down here with sufficient precision;\r\nit is only when the dropsy is connected with the suppression of the\r\nhemorrhoidal or menstrual discharge, or when the patient is in a\r\nplethoric state, that blood can be abstracted with advantage. He also\r\nfinds fault with the directions for the subsequent treatment, as not\r\nbeing accurately given. He justly remarks, that none but persons in the\r\nvigor of life and in good health would be able to digest dark-colored\r\nwine and pork after venesection. I may mention further that the text\r\nis faulty, that the words ἐγχειρέων γίνεσθαι ἄφυκτος should have been\r\nwritten ἀποκτέινει δ’ ἐυθὺς ὁ ὔδερος ἐφὴν γένηται. He attributes the\r\nmistake to the first amanuensis who wrote the words in question.\r\n\r\n[590] In reference to this practice Horace says:\r\n\r\n    “Si noles sanus curres hydropicus.” (Serm. I., 1.)\r\n\r\n[591] Galen finds many things in this section also carelessly and\r\nconfusedly written, and therefore unworthy of Hippocrates. For example,\r\nthe list of cases in which purging is inapplicable, Galen holds to be\r\nincomplete; and even in some of the cases specified by Hippocrates he\r\ndemurs to admit his views to be correct; for example, in diseases of\r\nthe spleen he contends that melanogogues are strongly indicated. Many\r\nmore of the rules he considers to be vaguely and inaccurately stated.\r\nAltogether, then, he holds that it is a loss of time to devote much\r\nattention to writings of such a stamp; but, he shrewdly remarks, there\r\nis no persuading many people to study only such writings as are clear,\r\nand to leave such as are not so to the writers themselves; for it is\r\njust that, as they have paid no regard that we should understand what\r\nthey have written, we should not be very anxious to find out and learn\r\nwhat they say.\r\n\r\n[592] Galen correctly remarks that this rule is applicable in certain\r\ncases, but not in all.\r\n\r\n[593] As Galen remarks in his Commentary, something appears to be\r\nwanting here in order to indicate the disease to which these directions\r\napply. Perhaps, as he suggests afterwards, they are meant to apply to\r\ngeneral pains.\r\n\r\n[594] The Cantharis of the ancients was indisputably the _Mylabris\r\ncichorii_, or _M. Fusselini_. It continued to be used in\r\nancient times as a diuretic, (see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III.,\r\np. 153;) and is well known in the East at the present day.\r\n\r\n[595] All the remaining part of this work evidently consists of\r\nfragments put together, without any method or arrangement. Though\r\nnot devoid of interest, they decidedly have no connection with the\r\ntreatise On Regimen in Acute Diseases. Indeed an impartial examination\r\nof the whole Appendix must satisfy any one that there are but too good\r\ngrounds for holding with Galen, that the whole work is a disorderly\r\ncompilation, which, although it may have been made up of notes written\r\nor dictated by Hippocrates, had certainly not been published by him.\r\n\r\n[596] It most probably is the _Reseda mediterranea_. See\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., p. 331.\r\n\r\n[597] This description has always been regarded as very obscure.\r\nAccording to Galen it is the operation which was afterwards named\r\n_anabrochismus_. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., pp. 262, 269. M. Littré\r\ngives the following interesting observations on this passage by M.\r\nMalgaigne: “Quoiqu’il semble que l’auteur emploie deux fils, cependant\r\nil n’est fait mention que d’une aiguille. Il paraît bien indiqué que\r\nl’aiguille traverse deux plis transverseaux en marchant de haut en bas.\r\nVoici comment je traduirais le passage en question: pour le trichiasis,\r\navec une aiguille armée d’un fil, traversé de haut en bas le point le\r\nplus élevé (ou la base); de la paupière supérieure, après lui avoir\r\nfait former un pli, et repasser l’aiguille de la même manière un peu\r\nplus bas (ou près du bord libre); rapprochez les extrémités du fil, et\r\nfixez-les par un nœud: puis laissez-les tomber d’eux-mêmes. Si cela\r\nréussit, c’est bien: si non, it faudra recommencer.” (Op. Hippocrat.,\r\ntom. iii., p. xliv). In my Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA, (Vol. II.,\r\np. 163.) I have in so far fallen into the mistake of supposing this\r\ndescription to apply to the lower eyelid, and M. Ermerins would appear\r\nto have done the same. See Littré, l. c. The operation by the ligature\r\non hemorrhoids will be found more circumstantially described in the\r\ntreatise on that subject, of which a translation is given in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n[598] For the weights and measures mentioned here, and in other\r\nparts of our author’s works, see the Comment. on the last section of\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Syd. Soc. edit.\r\n\r\n[599] A mineral, consisting principally of sulphate of copper. See\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., pp. 400–2.\r\n\r\n[600] The μηκώνιον was applied to three totally distinct substances;\r\n1st, To a sort of opium, that is to say, the expressed juice of the\r\npoppy (see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., p. 280); 2d, to the _Euphorbia\r\npeplus_, L., (see Appendix to Dunbar’s Greek Lexicon, under the\r\nname): and, 3d, to the excrement of new-born children. It is singular\r\nthat the learned Foës, in his Œconomia Hippocratica, should apply\r\nit in this place to the last of these; for if Hippocrates had used\r\nsuch a substance medicinally, we may be well assured that it would\r\nnot have been overlooked by Dioscorides and Galen. There is every\r\nreason, however, to suppose that it is the same as the πέπλος of\r\nDioscorides and Galen, that is to say, the _Euphorbia peplus_, which\r\nwas recommended as a drastic purgative by all the ancient authorities\r\non the Materia Medica, and consequently would be a medicine very\r\napplicable either in coma or dropsy.\r\n\r\n[601] All the commentators admit that the last section is obscure. It\r\nwould appear to me that Galen understands the expression τὸ ἀπὸ τῶν\r\nκοπρἰων as applying ἑδρικοῖς, that is to say, to affections of the\r\nanus. I have followed Littré in giving the passage a very different\r\ninterpretation, but I am by no means sure that Galen may not be right.\r\n\r\n[602] De Diebus Decretoriis, i.\r\n\r\n[603] See the Argument of the Prognostics.\r\n\r\n[604] Μηδὲν εἰκῆ, μηδὲν ὑπερορῇν.

In the yellow fever of the West Indies, which would certainly\r\nappear to me to be a variety of the causus, the mind is said to be\r\nwonderfully entire to the last. Dr. Fergusson gives a very striking\r\ninstance of this in describing the case of Sir James Leith, the British\r\nGovernor of Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\n[607] Traité des Fièvres ou Irritations Cérébro-spinales\r\nintermittentes, d’après des Observations recueillies en France, en\r\nCorse et en Afrique.

The narrative contains the most distinct and\r\nunequivocal traces of the belief in the contagiousness of consumption.\r\n\r\n[617] Thasus is an island in the Ægean sea, off the coast of Thrace,\r\nwhich bears the modern name of Thaso _or_ Tasso. It was in a\r\nflourishing condition in the time of Hippocrates, and a tributary to\r\nAthens, but revolted from that power after its disasters in Sicily\r\nduring the Peloponnesian war. See Herodot., vi., 47; Thucydid., i.,\r\n101; viii., 66. Galen states that it is cold, with a northerly exposure.\r\n\r\n[618] According to Galen, in his Commentary on this passage, the\r\nsetting of the Pleiades takes place fifty days after the autumnal\r\nequinox. See the Argument to the treatise On Airs, etc.\r\n\r\n[619] We have already stated that the ardent fevers or causi, of which\r\nrepeated mention is made in the Hippocratic treatises, were fevers of\r\nthe remittent type, in short that they were the same as the bilious\r\nremittent fevers of Pringle and Monro.\r\n\r\n[620] I need scarcely say that the disease here described is _cynanche\r\nparotidæa_ or _parotitis_. It is a remarkable proof of our author’s\r\ntalent for observation, that he has pointed out the tendency of the\r\ndisease to be complicated with swelling and inflammation of the\r\ntesticles. Altogether the description of the disease here given is\r\nquite applicable to the _mumps_ of modern times. As stated by him, the\r\nswelling of the testicles is generally painful. See the Commentary of\r\nGalen.\r\n\r\n[621] On reference to Galen’s Commentary it will be seen that anciently\r\nthe reading of this passage was reckoned equivocal. According to one of\r\nthe readings, the meaning is that those who were sick did not require\r\nto come to the Iatrium for advice. See also Littré’s annotations on\r\nthis passage.\r\n\r\n[622] Galen thinks our author expresses himself confusedly in this\r\nplace, but Littré justly defends him from this charge. According to\r\nLittré, Hippocrates means that those who had been long affected with\r\nconsumption (the term used, ὑποφθειρομένων, rather signifies had\r\nobscure symptoms of consumption), then betook themselves to bed; but\r\nthose who were in a doubtful state, then first manifested signs of\r\nconfirmed phthisis; and, finally, that there were some who then for the\r\nfirst time felt the attack of phthisis, and that these were persons who\r\nwere predisposed to it. According to Galen, the phthisical constitution\r\nis marked by a narrow and shallow chest, with the scapulæ protuberant\r\nbehind like wings; and hence he says chests of this construction\r\nhave been named alar. He further states that there are two forms of\r\nconsumption, the one originating in a defluxion from the head, and the\r\nother being connected with the rupture of a vessel in the lungs. I may\r\nbe allowed to mention in this place, in confirmation of our author’s\r\naccuracy of observation with regard to the connection of hemoptysis\r\nwith phthisis, that Louis found hemoptysis to a greater or less extent\r\nin two thirds of his cases. (Researches on Phthisis, p. 166, Sydenham\r\nSociety edition.) The same author relates several cases in which death\r\noccurred suddenly and unexpectedly, as Hippocrates states to have\r\nhappened to some of his patients. (Ibid.)\r\n\r\n[623] I am of opinion that the species of phthisis noticed in the\r\nlatter part of this section was the acute form of phthisis described\r\nby Louis (p. 351). Our author, it will be remarked, states that his\r\npatients were mostly delirious when near death. Louis, in like manner,\r\nmentions delirium in, I believe, every one of the cases of acute\r\nphthisis which he relates. Galen justly remarks, that, in the ordinary\r\nforms of phthisis, delirium is not a common symptom. I would also call\r\nattention to our author’s observation regarding the inflamed state of\r\nthe fauces, which is also amply confirmed by the observation of Louis\r\nin this form of phthisis.\r\n\r\n[624] The nature of the continual fevers of the ancients is fully\r\nexplained in the Commentary on the twenty-seventh section of the\r\nSecond Book of PAULUS ÆGINETA. Galen, in his Commentary on\r\nthis passage, marks their nature very distinctly in few words. He says\r\nthat such fevers as have an exacerbation of fever ending in complete\r\napyrexia are called intermittents, whereas such as do not end in a\r\ncomplete remission of the fever are called continual. See further De\r\nDiff. Febr., ii., 2. In a word, the continual fevers were decidedly of\r\nthe remittent type. See further Donald Monro’s work on Army Diseases,\r\nin the beginning of the chapter on the Bilious Remittent Fever.\r\n\r\n[625] The introduction of phthisis in this place has created some\r\ndifficulty in the interpretation, as may be seen on reference to Galen\r\nand Littré. Galen gives a very interesting account of the way in which\r\ninterpolations often took place. (Opera, tom. v., p. 356.)\r\n\r\n[626] The text of this last sentence is in an unsettled state. The\r\nfollowing would be a translation of it as it stands in the Basle\r\nedition of Galen’s Works: “Of all the cases described under this\r\nconstitution, those alone which were of a phthisical character proved\r\nfatal. But they (the phthisical affections?) did not supervene upon the\r\nother fevers.” Provided this be the true meaning of the passage, it\r\nwould merit great attention, as seeming to contain a declaration that\r\nintermittent fevers superinduced an immunity to phthisis. I need not\r\nsay that this supposed fact has been exciting a great deal of interest\r\nlately in the profession, more especially in France.\r\n\r\n[627] It is to be borne in mind that the autumn began with the rising\r\nof Arcturus, and ended with the setting of the Pleiades. The setting\r\nof the Pleiades then indicated the commencement of winter. The\r\nclassical reader will find the different seasons, strikingly defined\r\nby the rising and setting of the stars, in Virgil’s Georgics. See in\r\nparticular Georg. i., 221.\r\n\r\n[628] Galen thus explains the origin of the ophthalmies. He says, the\r\nconstitution of the air being not only cold and humid, but attended\r\nalso with hurricanes. The eyes were thus injured, and consequently were\r\nthe first part of the body to show symptoms of disease. The dysenteric\r\nand other alvine complaints which followed, he ascribes to the\r\nconstriction of the skin induced by the cold, and to the humoursæ of\r\nthe system aggravated and increased by the humid state of the season.\r\nThese humours being thus shut up by the occlusion of the pores of the\r\nskin, part of them were determined to the intestines, occasioning\r\ndiarrhœa, tenesmus, dysentery, etc.; some to the bladder, inducing\r\nstrangury; and some to the mouth of the stomach, occasioning vomiting.\r\n\r\n[629] Galen states in his Commentary that the phrenitis is connected\r\nwith inflammation of the parts about the brain. We have mentioned\r\nbefore that the phrenitis of the ancients was a febrile affection, and\r\nnot idiopathic inflammation of the brain, as is generally supposed.\r\n\r\n[630] According to Galen, the causi _or_ ardent fevers are occasioned\r\nby yellow bile collected about the vessels of the liver and stomach,\r\nand the tertians by the same diffused over the whole body.\r\n\r\n[631] Galen states in his Commentary that children are peculiarly\r\nsubject to convulsions owing to the weakness of their nervous system.\r\nHe adds, that in their case convulsions are not attended with so much\r\ndanger as in other cases. See the Hippocratic treatise On Dentition.\r\n\r\n[632] The fever here described is evidently the semitertian. See\r\nPAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 34. “The true semitertian,” says M. Bartels,\r\nas quoted by M. Littré, “is a real complication of an intermittent\r\nfever with another fever of a continual type. It does not show itself\r\nbut rarely in our countries; but it is more frequent in the hotter\r\ncountries of Europe, although the false semitertian has oftener than\r\nonce been confounded with the true. In the true, the intermittent fever\r\nis tertian; the non-intermittent is quotidian.” See also Galen, Opera,\r\ntom. v., p. 362; ed. Basil.\r\n\r\n[633] The text here is in an unsatisfactory state, and, as usual in\r\nsuch cases, no ingenuity nor pains can do much to mend it. See Foës\r\nand Littré. I have translated the disputed words “not resolved,” which\r\nseems to me to agree best with the sense. Every practical physician\r\nknows that swellings of the glands, which continue long and do not\r\nsuppurate, are unfavorable in fevers.\r\n\r\n[634] The modern physician will not fail to be struck with this\r\nobservation as to the termination of certain cases of fever in\r\ndetermination to the kidneys. Galen remarks in his Commentary on this\r\npassage, that as the general system is often purged by the bowels, so\r\nis it also sometimes by the kidneys and bladder. This, he adds, is a\r\nprotracted and painful mode of resolution in fevers. The reader will\r\nremark the characters of the urine as stated below by our author. One\r\ncannot help being struck with his statement, that all these cases\r\nrecovered. I am not aware of any modern observations bearing on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n[635] There is considerable difficulty here in determining the reading.\r\nSee Littré, whom I have followed.\r\n\r\n[636] I need scarcely remark that this passage is of classical\r\ncelebrity. Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the first time he\r\nread it he thought it unworthy of Hippocrates to lay it down as a rule\r\nof practice, that “the physician should do good to his patient, or at\r\nleast no harm;” but that, after having seen a good deal of the practice\r\nof other physicians, and observed how often they were justly exposed to\r\ncensure for having bled, or applied the bath, or given medicines, or\r\nwine unseasonably, he came to recognize the propriety and importance of\r\nthe rule laid down by Hippocrates. The practice of certain physicians,\r\nGalen remarks, is like playing at the dice, when what turns up may\r\noccasion the greatest mischief to their patients. The last clause of\r\nthis passage is very forcibly put. Galen, however, informs us that in\r\nsome of the MSS. instead of “art” he found “nature;” that is to say,\r\nthat the physician is “the minister (_or_ servant) of nature.”\r\nEither of the readings, he remarks, will agree very well with the\r\nmeaning of the passage.\r\n\r\n[637] The reader will find it interesting to refer here to the\r\nPrognostics. See also the Commentary of Galen. Let me here impress\r\nupon the reader the necessity of making frequent comparisons of the\r\nPrognostics with this work, if he would wish rightly to apprehend the\r\nbearing and meaning of the latter. That the Epidemics are entirely\r\nfounded upon the principles of prognosis there can be no doubt.\r\n\r\n[638] It is to be recollected that the rising of Arcturus marked the\r\nbeginning of autumn, and the setting of the Pleiades the end of it. See\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n[639] The season of the Dog-star was immediately after the summer\r\nsolstice, namely, when the sun enters the constellation Leo. The\r\nclassical reader will readily bring to his recollection the lines of\r\nHorace, which are descriptive of this season:\r\n\r\n          “Jam Procyon furit;\r\n    Et stella vesani Leonis,\r\n    Sole dies referente siccos.”\r\n\r\n[640] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the attacks of paraplegia\r\n(that is to say, of apoplexy) were brought on by the cold winds of the\r\nwinter succeeding to a humid autumn.\r\n\r\n[641] The causi _or_ ardent fevers, it is worthy of remark, began\r\nthis season in spring, but were not of a fatal character until autumn.\r\nIn modern times the bilious remittent fever has uniformly been found\r\nto be most aggravated in autumn, and hence it has been named by some\r\nauthorities the autumnal remittent fever. See the works of Sydenham,\r\nPringle, Monro, and Cleghorn. Monro mentions that he seldom saw it in\r\nspring, but that it is common in the neighborhood of London towards the\r\nend of summer and beginning of autumn. All these authorities are agreed\r\nthat it is of a highly bilious nature.\r\n\r\n[642] Monro mentions epistaxis as occurring in the autumnal remittent\r\nfever; he says it did not prove a crisis in any case.\r\n\r\n[643] The complication of the autumnal remittent fever with jaundice\r\nis noticed by Sir John Pringle (Obs. iii., 4), and by Monro (On\r\nArmy Diseases, p. 161). Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that when\r\nnature is unable to evacuate the bile, it is collected in the skin,\r\nand occasions jaundice. He adds, that the occurrence of the jaundice\r\nin this case was unfavorable, owing to its taking place before the\r\nseventh day. When occurring on the seventh day, jaundice was reckoned a\r\nfavorable symptom. See On Crises, 3; Aphorism, iv., 62, 64.\r\n\r\n[644] The reader may feel interested to learn Galen’s hypothesis by\r\nwhich he accounts for the hemorrhage in this case. He says it is\r\nproduced by the redundancy of yellow bile, which, being mixed up with\r\nthe blood and heating it, is carried up to the head, where it produces\r\nrupture of the vessels and hemorrhage.\r\n\r\n[645] Modern observations have confirmed this account of the generally\r\nfatal issue of febrile diseases after parturition. In the Hippocratic\r\nwork On Diseases, fever after delivery in a woman is reckoned among the\r\ncases which generally prove fatal.\r\n\r\n[646] I would again request the attention of my contemporaries to the\r\ncharacters of the urine before a crisis, as given by Hippocrates; and,\r\nin confirmation of them I will venture to introduce here an extract\r\nfrom Donald Monro’s admirable account of the autumnal remittent fever:\r\n“The urine in the beginning was commonly of a high color, though\r\nsometimes it was pale and limpid; but when the fever came to remit,\r\nthere was often a small sediment after each paroxysm; and as the fever\r\nwas going off, _it let fall a sediment in all_.” (Army Diseases,\r\netc., p. 159.) The absence of the sediment in the urine before the\r\ncrisis is an important fact in the history of febrile diseases, which I\r\nhave reason to think is not now sufficiently adverted to.\r\n\r\n[647] Galen does not hesitate to give it as his opinion that the\r\ndysentery was owing to the bile not being properly purged off by the\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n[648] The reader will find it interesting here to mark the alliance\r\nbetween the causus and phrenitis, to which we formerly adverted. Galen\r\nremarks that both arise from the same humour, that is to say, bile,\r\nwhich when it collects in the veins of the lower part of the body\r\ngives rise to causus; but from the beginning of autumn to the equinox,\r\nproduces phrenitis by being determined to the brain.\r\n\r\n[649] This is perhaps the most striking account of an aggravated form\r\nof causus which is anywhere to be found. Although less finished than\r\nthe celebrated picture of the disease given by Aretæus, it is evidently\r\nmore original. In fact, any human production which is very original\r\ncannot well be finished, and consequently a very finished work can\r\nscarcely be expected to be very original.\r\n\r\n[650] It is impossible to overrate the importance of these observations\r\non crises in fevers, provided they be correct and confirmed by general\r\nexperience. Monro, without appearing to have our author in view, seems\r\nto give an ample confirmation of his doctrines on crises as here laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n[651] From Galen’s Commentary it appears that the text here is in a\r\ndoubtful state. See also Littré.\r\n\r\n[652] Allusion is here made to the symptoms of delirium as described in\r\nthe fourth paragraph of the Prognostics. See Galen’s Commentary on this\r\npassage.\r\n\r\n[653] What an admirable and comprehensive enumeration of all the\r\ncircumstances upon which the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases are\r\nto be founded! Here we find nothing either wanting or redundant; and\r\nwith what conciseness and precision the whole is stated! Galen gives an\r\nelaborate and, upon the whole, a very interesting Commentary on this\r\nsection, but does not supply any new views, and there are few terms in\r\nit requiring explanation.\r\n\r\n[654] Having already stated in this work, as well as in the Commentary\r\non PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 27, my opinion respecting the\r\nnature of the continual fevers, I need not enlarge on the subject\r\nin this place. Whoever wishes for more information may find much to\r\ninterest him in the Commentary of Galen. Respecting the septans and\r\nnonans, he remarks, that, although conversant with fevers from his\r\nyouth, he had never met with any cases of these.\r\n\r\n[655] Galen, in illustration, states that epilepsy is sometimes carried\r\noff by an attack of quartan fever.\r\n\r\n[656] The semitertian was always looked upon as a very formidable form\r\nof fever. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 34. Galen gives a\r\nprolix, but not a very distinct account of it.\r\n\r\n[657] Galen, in his Commentary, states that he had often seen persons\r\nin consumption attacked with tertian and quotidian intermittents,\r\nbut admits that he had no more experience of quintans than he had of\r\nseptans and nonans. Avicenna. however, is not so sceptical as to the\r\noccurrence of these rare forms of intermittents. Indeed he says, he\r\nhad often met with quintans, and that a trustworthy physician of great\r\nexperience had assured him that he had met with nonans. (iii., 1, 3,\r\n67.) Rhazes also would appear to acknowledge the occurrence of all\r\nthese varieties of intermittent fever. (Contin., xxx., 10, 1, 409.)\r\n\r\n[658] The text is much improved in Littré’s edition, so that the\r\nmeaning is pretty intelligible without any commentary. Galen states\r\nin explanation, that the three varieties of fever are thus marked and\r\ndistinguished from one another: in the first, the fever attains its\r\nheight at the commencement, and gradually diminishes until the crisis;\r\nin the second, it begins mild, and gradually reaches its height at the\r\ncrisis; in the third, the fever begins mild, gradually attains its\r\nheight, and then gradually subsides until the crisis.\r\n\r\n[659] These are all febrile diseases, and for the most part of the\r\nardent type. In order to enter properly into the spirit of them, the\r\nreader will find it necessary to revert frequently to the Prognostics,\r\nand compare the parallel passages. See also the Argument.\r\n\r\n[660] Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the fatal issue of this\r\ncase might have been anticipated after the return of the fever on the\r\nthird day, with a complication of bad symptoms, such as great thirst,\r\ndry tongue, black urine, delirium, coldness of the extremities, and\r\nso forth. The modern reader will be struck with the description of\r\nthe respiration, namely, that the patient seemed like a person who\r\nforgot for a time the _besoin de respirer_, and then, as it were,\r\nsuddenly recollected himself. Such is the meaning of the expression as\r\nexplained by Galen in his Commentary, and in his work On Difficulty\r\nof Breathing. By “rare” is always meant “few in number.” The reader\r\nwill remark that this is a striking case of a fever having regular\r\nexacerbations on the even days, and slight remissions on the uneven.\r\n\r\n[661] This, it will be remarked, is a case of fever induced from\r\nobvious causes, namely, excessive fatigue and dissipation. We must\r\ntake into account, however, the febrile constitution of the season.\r\nAccording to Galen, the fatal result could have been confidently\r\nforeseen from the seventh day. The distention in the hypochondriac\r\nregion here described would appear to have been meteorism. The\r\nthrobbing in this region was no doubt owing no the same cause. The rash\r\nwas most probable miliary. It is described as resembling _vari_\r\n(ἴονθοι), by which was probably meant _acne_. See PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Vol. I., p. 454. Upon reference to the Prognostics, it\r\nwill be remarked that the characters of the urine are all bad, that is\r\nto say, it was either suppressed, or the sediment was either wanting or\r\nblack and farinaceous. See Prognost. 12. By “black,” as applied to the\r\nurine, is to be understood “a dark-red color,” like that of wine.\r\n\r\n[662] There is nothing in this case very remarkable, or which stands in\r\nneed of elucidation; but yet the reader may feel interested in Galen’s\r\nreflections upon it. The recovery he holds to have been unexpected,\r\nas a different result might have been anticipated from the characters\r\nof the alvine discharge, and of the urine at the commencement. The\r\nfavorable change he attributes to the swelling of the spleen, whereby\r\nthe peccant humors were attracted to it; and he further remarks, that\r\nas the swelling of the spleen diminished, the humors are described as\r\nhaving passed down to the extremities, after having first affected the\r\ngroin of the side on which the spleen is situated. He further calls\r\nattention to the improved characters of the urine when the swelling of\r\nthe spleen and pains of the limbs supervened. Still, however, he adds,\r\nthere was a remnant of the cacochymy in the system which gave rise to\r\nthe relapse on the fourteenth day, so that the complete crisis did not\r\ntake place until the seventeenth day.\r\n\r\n[663] This is evidently a well-marked case of puerperal fever, or\r\nof fever complicated with the puerperal state. There is nothing\r\nparticularly interesting in Galen’s commentary on it. He states that\r\nthe application made in order to remove the suppression of the lochial\r\ndischarge may either have been a pessary or a suppository. It seems\r\nmost likely to have been the former. On the composition of the ancient\r\npessaries, see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book VII., 24. He remarks that\r\nthe symptoms first stated are unfavorable, but not necessarily fatal,\r\nuntil we come to the coldness of the extremities, which is an extremely\r\nmortal symptom in the beginning of a disease when combined with a very\r\nviolent fever. The modern reader will be struck with the expression\r\nthat “the attendants seldom put her in mind” to make water; it is very\r\ndescriptive, however, of the state of stupor the patient was in when\r\nshe was so insensible that she did not attend to the calls of nature.\r\n\r\n[664] Galen remarks that it was reckoned very extraordinary for a rigor\r\nnot to be followed by febrile heat. See Comment. et de Rigore; de Diff.\r\nFebr., ii.; and Foës’s long annotations on this passage.\r\n\r\n[665] It will be remarked that the characters of the urine throughout\r\nare favorable. Though darkish at first, this was reckoned not\r\nunfavorable, as being connected with the lochial discharge. (See Galen.\r\nComment. 2, Epid. iii.) The sediments afterwards are all of good omen;\r\nbut, as Galen remarks, its first characters indicated a prolonged fever.\r\n\r\n[666] On the Critical Days, see PAULUS ÆGINETA Book II., 7.\r\n\r\n[667] On comparing the symptoms here enumerated with the Prognostics,\r\nit will be remarked that none of them are of fatal omen. But the white\r\nsediment, and afterwards the reddish color of the urine, while they\r\nindicated recovery, at the same time prognosticated a protracted attack\r\nof fever. See Prognost., 12. The reader will further remark that there\r\nis an absence of all the decidedly fatal symptoms, such as delirium,\r\ncoldness of the extremities at the commencement, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[668] The rapid recovery in this case would seem to be partly\r\nattributable to the decided plan of treatment, namely, the copious\r\naffusion of hot water on the head. Hippocrates probably had it in view\r\nwhen he wrote the forty-second Aphorism of the Seventh Book: “In fever\r\nnot connected with bile, if a large quantity of hot water be poured\r\nover the head, it proves a resolution of the fever.” Galen points it\r\nout as a remarkable circumstance, that in this case the crisis took\r\nplace without concoction of the urine, in consequence of the hemorrhage\r\nfrom the nose, and the sweating.\r\n\r\n[669] In this case, as Galen remarks, the continued sweats, unfavorable\r\ncondition of the hypochondriac region, and the black urine, precluded\r\nall hopes of recovery. He thinks our author related the case as an\r\ninstance of sudden death in fever, this patient having died on the\r\nfourth day after the attack (the first not being counted). See his\r\nCommentary. He also makes reflections upon this case in his work On\r\nDifficulty of Breathing, where he points out the danger of meteorism of\r\nthe hypochondriac region as being necessarily accompanied with dyspnœa,\r\nand connected with inflammation (2).\r\n\r\n[670] This case, as Galen remarks, is interesting from the suddenness\r\nof the fatal result. We should not hesitate nowadays to set it down\r\nas a case of malignant erysipelas; the pain, swelling, and bullæ of\r\nthe foot and ankle must have been of this nature. By the way, these\r\nbullæ, when not followed by suppuration, are represented in the Coacæ\r\nPrænotiones, as a fatal symptom. Galen thinks it strange that this\r\npatient was not bled, but accounts for it by supposing that Hippocrates\r\nhad been called in too late. He remarks on this case in the Second Book\r\nof his work On Difficulty of Breathing.\r\n\r\n[671] Galen looks upon this patient as an example _or_ paradigm of\r\ngeneral principles in Prognostics. Thus, with regard to the characters\r\nof the urine, it is stated that on the eleventh day the urine was thin,\r\nof a good color, and having many substances floating about in it, but\r\nwithout sediment. Thus matters remained until the sixteenth, when the\r\nurine became somewhat thicker, and had a slight sediment. Now Galen\r\nremarks (as the reader will find on turning to the Book of Prognostics)\r\nthat these characters of the urine are indicative of recovery after a\r\nprotracted disease. Galen further points out that no one of the fatal\r\nsymptoms are mentioned, and that swellings of the parotid glands and\r\nthe dysenteric affections of the bowels indicated that the crisis\r\nwould be distant. He also calls attention to the case as confirmatory\r\nof the doctrines of Critical Days. In the Second Book of his work On\r\nDifficulty of Breathing, he makes some remarks, of no great importance\r\nhowever, on the meteorism of the hypochondriac region, as noticed in\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\n[672] In this case, as Galen remarks, the characters of the urine\r\nfrom the first were such as to indicate a fatal and speedy result. On\r\nthe second day the urine was turbid, and without any sediment; on the\r\nthird day the same, and consequently confirming the anticipation of the\r\ndisease proving mortal; on the fourth, oily urine, with epistaxis, so\r\nthat it was not to be wondered at that the patient died on the sixth.\r\nIndeed, when we further take into account the state of the breathing,\r\nthe coldness of the extremities, the meteorism of the hypochondriac\r\nregion, and the subsultus tendinum, it is difficult to imagine a\r\nmore hopeless case of fever. Having mentioned “oily urine,” it may\r\nbe well to state its characters, as fully given by one of the later\r\nauthorities on urology, namely Theophilus. He says, when the urine\r\nin fevers assumes the color of oil, it indicates that the fat of the\r\nbody is melting down; when the appearance of the urine still more\r\nresembles oil, it shows a still greater melting; and when the urine\r\nin consistence and color exactly resembles oil of a dark color, it\r\nprognosticates a fatal collapse. (De Urinis, 17; ed. Ideler.) On this\r\nsubject, see further some very interesting observations by Foës, in his\r\nannotations on this passage (p. 988). With regard to the respiration in\r\nthis case, see also the remarks of Galen in the Third Book of his work\r\nOn Difficulty of Breathing (tom. vii., p. 932; ed. Kühn). As Galen here\r\nremarks, Hippocrates explains the meaning of this passage in one of\r\nhis Aphorisms, where he writes thus: “In fevers, when the respiration\r\nstops, it is a bad symptom, for it prognosticates convulsion.”\r\n\r\n[673] According to Galen, this case is an instructive example of the\r\ndanger of neglecting the diet at the commencement of complaints which\r\nappear unimportant. This man, having taken supper at the beginning\r\nof a fever which appeared slight, suffered therefrom as the result\r\nshowed; that is to say, vomiting ensued, followed by serious symptoms,\r\namong which Galen particularizes, as indicating a fatal result, urine\r\nat first thick and without sediment, and afterwards oily. So much\r\nimportance did the ancient physicians attach to observations on the\r\nurine in fevers! Galen further calls attention to the fact, that the\r\npatient died on a critical day, that is to say, on the eleventh.\r\n\r\n[674] Galen, in the commentary, makes a remark regarding this report,\r\nwhich appears more important to him than it will do to most modern\r\nreaders, namely, that he wonders Hippocrates did not state the age of\r\nthis patient. He adds, that it is very rare for a pregnant woman to\r\nhave such a serious fever without parting with her child. He thinks the\r\npatient, in the present instance, owed her recovery to the strength\r\nof her constitution, as “urine white, and not of a good color,” in\r\ncombination with the other bad symptoms, indicated an unfavorable\r\nresult. By the way, upon reference to the Basle edition of Galen, and\r\nto Foës’s annotations on this case, it will be seen that there is a\r\ndifference of reading in the words descriptive of the urine, that is to\r\nsay, some read ἀχρόων, some εὑχρόων. Certainly it appears to me that\r\nFoës is right in preferring the latter. The decided crisis, it will be\r\nremarked, took place on a critical day, that is to say, the fourteenth,\r\nby a sweat.\r\n\r\n[675] Here again Galen calls attention principally to the characters\r\nof the urine, which is first described as being “of a good color, but\r\nthin.” Now, by a good color of the urine, Galen observes, was meant of\r\na slightly yellow color. In this case, as usual, the crisis was marked\r\nby a sediment in the urine.\r\n\r\n[676] Œuvres d’Hippocrate, tom. iii., Arg., pp. xxxvi.-xlii. tom. v.,\r\npp. 57–70.\r\n\r\n[677] There is some doubt, however, even on this head; indeed Riolanus\r\ndoes not scruple to affirm, with a considerable degree of plausibility,\r\nthat Ruffus must have lived after Galen, since he is nowhere mentioned\r\nby the latter. (Anthropographia, i., 5.)\r\n\r\n[678] In illustration, consult Plutarch (Placit. Philosoph., v., 29).\r\n\r\n[679] De Differ. Feb., i., 7; tom. vii., p. 296, ed. Kühn.\r\n\r\n[680] Commentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 16, 36; IV., 25,\r\nSyd. Soc. edition.\r\n\r\n[681] Disquisitio Historico-Medica de Natura Morbi Atheniensium.\r\nStuttgart, 1831.\r\n\r\n[682] On this case Galen has left very lengthy and elaborate\r\ncommentaries, containing much important and amusing matter, but not\r\na little verbose trifling, to say the least. Our limits, as well as\r\nour tastes, dispose us to be very sparing in our extracts from them.\r\nPassing over his remarks on the solecism in syntax, with which the\r\nReport commences, and his observations on the absence of all mention\r\nof the exciting causes, as is the usual practice of our author, I\r\nshall proceed to state what Galen says on the apparent neglect of\r\nvenesection in a case where it would certainly appear to have been\r\nclearly indicated. In this case, as Galen remarks, one or other of\r\nthese suppositions may be made: either that bleeding was not practiced,\r\nor that the author did not think of mentioning the practice here, as\r\nsupposing that it would be taken for granted that it was applied. Now,\r\nhe adds, the former supposition is very improbable, considering how\r\npartial our author shows himself to this practice in his works which\r\nare unquestionably genuine, such as On the Regimen in Acute Diseases,\r\nthe Aphorisms, the work On the Articulations, and even in this very\r\nbook, where in one place he mentions that he abstracted blood copiously\r\non the eighth day. If, then, he bled so late in febrile diseases, Galen\r\ncontends that he was not likely to neglect the operation in an earlier\r\nstage, when so much more demanded. He argues further, that in many\r\nof the other reports of cases he neglects to mention that the usual\r\nroutine of practice was followed: and therefore he inclines to the\r\nopinion that it is omitted to be mentioned here, because the author\r\nsupposed there could be no question on this point, more especially as\r\nit was his universal rule to bleed in all great complaints, when not\r\nprevented by the age or powers of the patient. He afterwards insists\r\nstrongly on venesection having been indicated in this case, in order\r\nto procure revulsion from the brain. As usual with the commentator,\r\nhe calls attention to the characters of the urine, and explains the\r\nmeaning of the term “cloudy,” as applied to the _eneorema_,\r\nor substances floating in the urine, by which he contends is to be\r\nunderstood a color intermediate between white and black. What follows\r\nin this very lengthy Commentary is very interesting in a general point\r\nof view as regards the views of some of the older commentators, but\r\nis not directly applicable to the present case. His observations on\r\nthe characters affixed to this and many of the subsequent cases have\r\nbeen noticed in the Argument. The reader will further remark of this\r\ncase that it is an instance of fever passing into a deposit (_or_\r\nabscess), and the latter into strangury, of which our author had made\r\nmention in the First Book of the Epidemics. I may further mention\r\nthat the reader will find much interesting matter in Galen’s work On\r\nTrembling, in illustration of the nature of the attack under which the\r\npatient labored.\r\n\r\n[683] Galen, in his Commentary, communicates a singular notion which\r\none of the earlier commentators maintained respecting the name of the\r\nplace where this patient was laid, that is to say, that this new wall,\r\nhaving been recently washed with quicklime, had been the cause of this\r\npatient’s illness. Galen, however, rejects this paltry conceit. He says\r\non his own authority, that there being three distinct classes of fever,\r\nnamely, the ephemeral, the hectic, and those connected with putrid\r\nhumors, the present case belongs to the last of these.\r\n\r\n[684] Galen compares the characters of the urine with their indications\r\nas given in the Prognostics. None of them are favorable, although not\r\ndecidedly fatal.\r\n\r\n[685] This complication cannot fail to attract attention, from its\r\nresemblance to an epidemic which prevailed in Scotland in the year\r\n1843. In this epidemic, as in the present case, the fever was very\r\nsubject to relapses and to jaundice at an early stage. Hippocrates,\r\nin one of his Aphorisms, pronounces jaundice in fevers before the\r\nseventh day to be a fatal symptom. (iv., 62, 64.) Galen justly thinks\r\nit somewhat singular that no further mention of the jaundice is made\r\nin the course of the report; but he inclines from this to draw the\r\nconclusion that it remained in the same state throughout. As there\r\nwas no crisis by the stomach, the bowels, the urine, or sweat, he\r\nconcludes that the jaundice could not have been carried off. From all\r\nthat has been said, he adds, it is clear that the organ primarily\r\naffected was the liver. Galen, then, decidedly opposes the view taken\r\nin the Explanation of the Characters respecting the cause of this man’s\r\ndeath, which he contends was not connected with any suppression of the\r\nalvine discharges, but with the affection of the liver. On the Scotch\r\nEpidemic, see Ed. and Lond. Med. Journal, March, 1844.\r\n\r\n[686] Most of the ancient authorities regarded deafness as an\r\nunfavorable symptom in fevers. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II.,\r\n4. The modern are divided in opinion on this point. Pringle and Huxham\r\nregard it as a favorable symptom, but Home looks upon it as unfavorable.\r\n\r\n[687] Here again Galen mentions the absurd notion of Sabinus the\r\ncommentator, that this man’s disease was occasioned by the locality in\r\nwhich he was laid. Galen, on the other hand, thinks it likely that the\r\npatient was conveyed to the garden as being a favorable situation for a\r\nperson ill of fever. He further alludes to this case in the Second Book\r\nof his work On Critical Days.\r\n\r\n[688] Galen remarks, that as there is no mention of a single favorable\r\nsymptom up to this date, the patient would certainly have died if he\r\nhad not been of a vigorous constitution.\r\n\r\n[689] Thus, as Galen remarks, after two ineffectual attempts, Nature\r\naccomplished a cure on the fortieth day.\r\n\r\n[690] There is not much to remark in this case. A modern reader will\r\nsuspect that there had been cerebral disease before the attack of the\r\nfever, and that matters had been brought to a crisis by the drinking\r\nof wine. Indeed Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that the precursory\r\nsymptoms indicate a congestion of humors in the brain, which of course\r\nwould be much aggravated by the wine, the brain then being, as he says,\r\nin a bad state; and the patient having inflicted an additional injury\r\nto the organ, by means of the drink, brought on the acute attack,\r\nwhich proved fatal in five days. The deafness, delirium, spasms, and\r\nbilious vomitings all indicate a cerebral affection. The state of\r\nthe hypochondria, as described in the report, Galen would seem to\r\nattribute to a spasmodic affection of the diaphragm, from sympathy with\r\nthe brain. Retraction of the hypochondrium is pronounced to be a bad\r\nsymptom in the First Book of the Prorrhetics. Galen justly contends\r\nthat there is no reason in this case to suspect any inflammation in\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\n[691] Galen’s remarks on this case are unusually brief; he attributes\r\nthe fever to a bilious plethora, and states that the result was such\r\nas might have been anticipated from a knowledge of the critical days,\r\nand of the characters of the urine. Indeed the latter appear to me well\r\ndeserving of attention.\r\n\r\n[692] This is in many respects an interesting case, and more\r\nespecially, from its being stated that the disease was complicated\r\nwith hereditary consumption. Galen, in his Commentary, remarks that\r\nsome authorities denied that any disease is congenital, but this\r\nopinion he decidedly rejects. The phthisical affection, however, as\r\nhe justly remarks, would not have occasioned so sudden an issue if it\r\nhad not been complicated with a complete prostration of the natural\r\npowers. He insists strongly on the striking description here given of\r\nthe total loss of the natural appetite, both in regard to food and\r\ndrink. Of course, no worse state of the system can be imagined than\r\nthat in which it is totally insensible to its own wants, nay, that\r\nit loathes the very articles which it stands most in need of. Galen\r\nproperly remarks in another place (Comment. I., in Epid. i.), that\r\nit is an extremely unfavorable symptom when in an ardent fever there\r\nis no thirst. The small abscess about the nates would seem to have\r\nbeen an incidental complication. It would appear to be now settled by\r\nthe best pathological authorities that there is no natural alliance\r\nbetween _phthisis_ and _fistula in ano_, as was at one time\r\nsuspected. See Andral (Cliniq. Médicale, tom. iv., p. 308), and Louis\r\n(On Phthisis, p. 89, Sydenham Society’s edition). The affection of the\r\nfauces and throat, which is described as having attacked the patient at\r\n“the commencement of the disease,” would appear to have been a common\r\ncomplication of that epidemic. It is noticed in the First Book of the\r\nEpidemics. Foës remarks, however, that some had referred it to that\r\nredness of the fauces to which persons laboring under consumption are\r\nliable. Compare Louis, l. c. p. ii., § 12. Galen makes mention of a\r\ndifference of reading in the MSS. he used in reference to the Critical\r\nDays.\r\n\r\n[693] On this brief case Galen has left a lengthy and elaborate\r\nCommentary, abounding in most interesting matters on a variety of\r\nsubjects; as, for example, the different readings and opinions of the\r\nmore ancient commentators on the characters at the end of this and\r\nthe other reports; on the formation of the Hippocratic Collection,\r\nand the extraordinary zeal of the Ptolemies in procuring books for\r\ntheir great Library at Alexandria, and so forth. There is not much in\r\nit, however, which bears directly on the present case, and therefore\r\nwe shall give but a very brief abstract of it. It appears from Galen\r\nthat there was a considerable diversity of readings in the latter part\r\nof it, more especially in regard to the number of days the patient\r\nlived; some of the old authorities having placed the death on the\r\nfifth, some on the seventh, and others on the eighth. Galen inclines\r\nto hold by the text as we now have it, and maintains, apparently with\r\ngood reason, that under such a combination of fatal symptoms it was\r\nnot likely that the patient’s strength should have stood out longer\r\nthan the fourth day. Another curious subject connected with this case\r\nwhich Galen slightly touches upon, but without throwing any light\r\nupon it, is the omission of the treatment. He justly remarks, that if\r\nHippocrates treated the patient himself, or superintended the treatment\r\nas managed by another, it is singular that there is no mention of\r\na clyster having been administered, nor of a cataplasm having been\r\napplied, nor of venesection having been practiced. I shall not attempt\r\nto solve the question here propounded by Galen. See the Argument. His\r\nCommentary also contains an interesting discussion on the meaning of\r\nthe expression “respiration elevated.” To give the sum of what has\r\nbeen advanced on this subject in a few words, it may signify laborious\r\nbreathing so as to move the labia of the nose; or it may mean simply\r\northopnœa, or it may signify laborious respiration, attended with\r\nelevation of the chest. By the way, this is evidently the “sublimis\r\nanhelitus” of Horace, in his famous ode entitled “Nireus.” I have often\r\nwondered that such a learned physician as Julius Cæsar Scaliger, in\r\nhis celebrated critique on Horace in his Poetics, should have remarked\r\non this expression: “Ex toto Galeno non intelligo quid sit sublimis\r\nanhelitus.” Galen, in fact, treats fully of the “sublimis anhelitus”\r\nin various parts of his works. See in particular On Difficulty of\r\nBreathing.\r\n\r\n[694] Galen has given us a lengthy Commentary on this case, but a great\r\npart of it relates to the characters and to other matters not of any\r\nvery great importance in this place. As he remarks, it is a striking\r\nexample of an acute fever induced by immoderate fatigue. It appears\r\nfrom his Commentary, moreover, that some of the older authorities had\r\nadded “drinking” to the excesses which induced his affection; that is\r\nto say, they proposed to read πότων instead of πόνων. The symptoms,\r\nupon reference to the Prognostics, are all such as indicated a fatal\r\nresult, namely, the blackish and thin urine, “the fumbling with\r\nthe bedclothes,” the coldness and lividity of the extremities, the\r\nmeteorism, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[695] In Galen’s Commentary on this case there is not much of any great\r\ninterest to the professional reader of the present day. He animadverts\r\nagain on the omission of all mention of the treatment, although, as he\r\nstates, venesection and the other usual means had no doubt been tried;\r\nindeed the report implies as much. Hippocrates, he repeats, never\r\nthinks of mentioning the usual routine of practice, as he takes it for\r\ngranted that the reader will understand that it was not neglected.\r\nIt is only on special occasions, then, that he thinks of making any\r\nparticular reference to the treatment. Galen remarks, that ileus being\r\nan inflammation of the upper intestines, is a particularly dangerous\r\naffection.\r\n\r\n[696] As remarked by Galen in his Commentary, this was no doubt a\r\ncase of ardent fever _or_ caucus, complicated with an incidental\r\nmiscarriage. There is no reason for looking upon it as being a case\r\nof puerperal fever. Galen thinks that the last word (caucus) is an\r\naddition made by the copyists, having been transferred from the\r\nGlossarium to the text in the course of transcription. Galen, as usual,\r\ndirects attention to the characters of the urine, which in this case\r\nare particularly unfavorable, being defective both in quantity and\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n[697] Galen’s remarks on the circumstances of this case are\r\nsufficiently to the purpose, but there is nothing very striking in\r\nthem. He states that the abortion may have been occasioned either\r\nby external causes--such as the application of pessaries for this\r\npurpose, and the like--or internal, such as hemorrhage from the neck\r\nof the uterus. and so forth. As in the former case, he pronounces the\r\nlast word (phrenitis) to be an addition to the text, as Hippocrates\r\nnever enters upon the diagnosis of diseases, as is done in the work\r\nOn Diseases. I suppose he means that our author’s real works are all\r\nfounded on Prognosis; whereas the other, being derived from the Cnidian\r\nschool, is founded on Diagnosis. See our observations on this subject\r\nin the Preliminary Discourse, and the Argument to the Prognostics.\r\n\r\n[698] Galen remarks, that with such a combination of fatal symptoms,\r\nnamely, coldness of the extremities, fetid vomiting, etc., it is\r\nwonderful that this patient stood out until the fourteenth day.\r\nHe thinks, however, that this is to be explained from her age and\r\nconstitution. He justly remarks that the occurrence of the epistaxis\r\ncould not be supposed sufficient to carry of such a combination of\r\nunfavorable symptoms. He once more protests against the last word of\r\nthe report (causus) being admitted as genuine. He confesses himself\r\nunable to determine whether “The Liars’ Market” was in Athens or\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n[699] This is entitled the pestilential constitution by Galen. By\r\nconstitution, he explains, is meant not only the preternatural state of\r\nthe atmosphere, but also of everything else which influences the state\r\nof the general health.\r\n\r\n[700] Galen remarks, that in the First Book of the Epidemics three\r\nconstitutions of the year are described and also that others are\r\ndescribed in the Second Book; but that these are not carefully drawn\r\nout for publication like those of the First and Third. He further\r\nremarks on this head, that the constitution of the season might prepare\r\nus for the putrid diseases, which are described below, as heat is the\r\nactive, and humidity the material, cause of all putrefaction.\r\n\r\n[701] Galen remarks that erysipelas is occasioned by a bilious\r\ndefluxion, but that it is not always of a malignant and putrid nature;\r\non the contrary, when the defluxion is mild, and the bile which\r\nproduces it is natural, it is not attended with any considerable injury\r\nto the body, if properly managed; but that the humor which produced\r\nthe erysipelas about to be described was not such, but of a malignant,\r\ncorrosive, and septic nature, being engendered by the humid and calm\r\nstate of the weather in such persons as were of a choleric constitution.\r\n\r\n[702] According to Galen, aphthæ in general are superficial ulcerations\r\nin the mouth, produced by the acrimony of the nurse’s milk, and which\r\nare easily removed by an astringent application. But in the present\r\ninstance the aphthæ were of a malignant nature.\r\n\r\n[703] The carbuncle (anthrax), Galen says, is always dangerous, and the\r\nproduct of bad humors. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. II., pp. 78,\r\n79. Galen, in his excellent work On the Difference of Fevers, writes\r\nthus: “In constitutions of the year, similar to those which Hippocrates\r\ndescribes as taking place in Cranon (See Ep. ii.). I have known cases\r\nof anthrax prevailing epidemically in no few numbers, the formation and\r\nother symptoms of which were exactly as described by him.” (Tom. vii.,\r\np. 293; ed. Kühn.)\r\n\r\n[704] Galen explains under this head that the term _epidemic_ is\r\nnot applied to any one disease, but that when many cases of any disease\r\noccur at the same time in a place, the disease is called an epidemic;\r\nand that when it is remarkably fatal it is called a plague.\r\n\r\n[705] The history of the epidemical erysipelas here described cannot\r\nfail to prove interesting to the modern reader. I need scarcely remark\r\nthat epidemics of a similar nature are occasionally met with in\r\nGreat Britain at the present day. I myself have encountered two such\r\nepidemics in the locality where I am now writing, the one in 1823, and\r\nthe other in 1846. As described by Hippocrates, the disease sometimes\r\nsupervened upon a slight injury, and generally terminated in gangrene.\r\nOn epidemical erysipelas, see De Haen (Ratio Medendi), Bartholinus\r\n(Hist. Anatom. Rat. Hist., 56), Wells (Transactions of a Society\r\nfor the Improvement of Medical and Chirurgical Knowledge), Cooper’s\r\nSurgical Dictionary; and Cyclopædia of Practical Medicine, under\r\n_Erysipelas_.\r\n\r\n[706] Galen amply confirms this statement, that when erysipelas fixes\r\non a particular part of the body it is more formidable in appearance\r\nthan in reality, and that the disease is attended with most danger when\r\nit leaves an external member, and is determined inwardly.\r\n\r\n[707] The classical reader will here call to his recollection a\r\nstriking passage in the celebrated description of the Plague of Athens,\r\nas given by Thucydides: “For the mischief, being at first seated in\r\nthe head, spread over the whole body, and if one survived the most\r\nformidable symptoms, an attack on the extremities manifested itself;\r\nfor it was determined to the genital organs and to the hands and feet,\r\nand many escaped with losing them, and some with the loss of their\r\neyes.” (ii., 49.) The passage is thus rendered by Lucretius:\r\n\r\n      “tamen in nervos huic morbus et artus\r\n    Ibat et in partes genitales corporis ipsas;\r\n    Et graviter partim metuentes limina lethi\r\n    Vivebant ferro privati parte virili:\r\n    Et manibus sine nonnulli pedibusque manebant\r\n    In vita tamen et perdebant lumina partim.”\r\n                                           (vi., 1203.)\r\n\r\nLucretius, it will be remarked, understands the historian to mean\r\nthat the mortified parts were amputated; and this opinion, although\r\nrejected by most of our non-professional editors of Thucydides, is\r\nconfirmed by what Galen says in his Commentary on this passage, namely,\r\nthat in erysipelas of the genital organs “we (meaning the physicians\r\nof his own time) are often obliged to excise the putrid parts, and\r\napply the cautery to them.” I would here further point out a singular\r\nmistake into which Dr. Bloomfield falls in his note on this passage of\r\nThucydides; he says that the words of the original (ἄκρας χεῑρας καὶ\r\nπόδας) “can only signify the ends of or lower joints of the fingers and\r\ntoes.” No one who is acquainted with the language of our author will\r\nrequire to be told that this is an entire misconception. In the works\r\nof Hippocrates χεῖρες is often put for the arms, and χεῖρες ἄκραι are\r\nalways applied to the hands.\r\n\r\n[708] Upon reference to the Glossary of Erotian, the Commentary of\r\nGalen, and the Annotations of Foës and Littré, the reader will see that\r\nthere is great difficulty in determining the text in this place. After\r\nexamining all that has been written on the subject, one cannot come to\r\nany satisfactory conclusion as to the true reading. I have adopted the\r\nmeaning which seems to suit best with the passage. The professional\r\nreader will scarcely require to be reminded that in cases of phthisis\r\nthere is often a notable impairment of the voice.\r\n\r\n[709] Galen makes the important remark on this word, that, in febrile\r\ndiseases, epistaxis is always a bad symptom.\r\n\r\n[710] This obliviousness is a feature of the plague, as described by\r\nThucydides: “And some, when they first left their beds, were seized\r\nwith an utter forgetfulness of all things, and knew not themselves nor\r\ntheir relatives.” (l. c.)\r\n\r\n[711] Our author alludes to the affection called coma vigil by the\r\nlater authorities. In this affection, as Galen remarks, the patient\r\nlies with his eyes shut, but can get no sound sleep. This, of course,\r\nis so much more the case provided pain be present, as it necessarily\r\nwill prevent the occurrence of sleep. See Galen’s tract On Coma.\r\n\r\n[712] The low muttering delirium of typhoid fevers is here evidently\r\nalluded to. Galen, in his Commentary, guards the reader against\r\nsupposing that the fever passed into lethargus.\r\n\r\n[713] This description apparently can refer to nothing but pestilential\r\nbuboes.\r\n\r\n[714] It is impossible not to recognize this as a description of\r\n_purulent ophthalmia_. Celsus thus describes the ficus: “Est\r\netiam ulcus quod a fici similitudine σύκωσις Græcis nominatur,\r\nubi caro excrescit; et id quidem generale est. Sub eo vero duæ\r\nspecies aunt. Alterum ulcus durum et rotundum est: alterum humidum\r\net inæquale. Ex duro exiguum quoddam et glutinosum exit: ex humido\r\nplus, et mali odoris.” See the Lexicons of Hesychius and Phavorinus,\r\nand also PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book III., 3. It will be remarked\r\nthat Hippocrates also makes mention of fungous excrescences about\r\nthe pudenda. Were they syphilitic? In other words, did they derive\r\ntheir origin from elephantiasis? See the Annotations on PAULUS\r\nÆGINETA, Book IV., 1, Sydenham Society’s edition.\r\n\r\n[715] The meaning of this term is not precisely determined. Galen’s\r\naccount of it may apply both to exanthemata, and pustulæ. The\r\ndescription of the eruption in the Plague of Athens is likewise vague\r\nand indeterminate. (Thucyd, ii., 49.)\r\n\r\n[716] These intestinal complaints are all mentioned in the description\r\nof the Plague at Athens. (l. c.) Upon reference to the Commentary of\r\nGalen, the reader will remark that there is a question here respecting\r\nthe reading.\r\n\r\n[717] Galen, in his Commentary, makes the remark that he observed the\r\nsame symptom in the plague which raged in his time.\r\n\r\n[718] It will readily be understood that a colliquative diabetes would\r\nprove a very unfavorable complication of these complaints.\r\n\r\n[719] By nocturnal fevers, according to Galen, was meant quotidians,\r\nwhich had their paroxysms during the night. Foës inclines to think that\r\ndiurnal should also be inserted in this place. These nocturnal fevers\r\nare thus described by D. Monro: “The sick were restless and uneasy _at\r\nnight_; but commonly felt themselves cooler and lighter in the daytime:\r\nand although they had no cold fit, as the fever came on _at nights_,\r\nand many of them no breathing sweat, as they became cooler and freer\r\nfrom the fever in the morning; yet the fits were so remarkable, that\r\nmany of the patients used to say that they had a regular fit of an\r\nague _every night_, and some few that they had the fit every second\r\n_night_.” (Army Diseases, etc., p. 158.)\r\n\r\n[720] The account of the origin and progress of consumption here given\r\nis, upon the whole, wonderfully correct. Common experience seems\r\nto have decided that spring and autumn are the most fatal seasons\r\nto phthisical patients. Avicenna makes the remark, which is very\r\nimportant, and deserves to be kept in mind, that by phthisis, in this\r\nplace, Hippocrates most probably meant hectic fever, connected with\r\ndisease of the internal viscera, which had been in an inflamed state\r\nduring the acute attack of the fever. (iii., 1, 3, 67.)\r\n\r\n[721] I shall not enter into a discussion of the different readings of\r\nthis interesting passage. I may mention that our great pathological\r\nauthority on phthisis, Dr. Louis, agrees with Hippocrates in deciding\r\nthat the lymphatic temperament constitutes a more or less marked\r\npredisposition to the development of phthisis. (p. 483.) Galen\r\ndescribes the phlegmatic temperament as being attended with a soft\r\nand slightly tumid skin. He attributes the disease in their case to a\r\ncacochymy, that is to say, to cachexia. I need scarcely remark that\r\nthis opinion is strongly advocated by one of the highest authorities\r\nof the day, I mean Sir James Clark. See his treatise on Tubercular\r\nPhthisis. Galen gives a discussion on the color of the eyes, about\r\nwhich there is some difficulty, as the ancient terms which relate to\r\ncolors are not very well defined. The term here used (χαροπὸς) may\r\nsignify either blue or gray. Galen considers this color of the eyes as\r\na symptom of a cold and humid temperament.\r\n\r\n[722] There is an ambiguity in the part of the sentence which relates\r\nto women, as Galen states in his Commentary. Galen does not hesitate to\r\ndeclare that women are more subject to phthisis than men, an opinion\r\nupon which modern authorities are not at all agreed. See the recent\r\npublications of Louis and Clark on Phthisis.\r\n\r\n[723] The last paragraph, and the latter clause of the preceding one,\r\nwere at first attached to the end of the subsequent cases, and were\r\ntransferred to their present position by Dioscorides the commentator\r\na short time before Galen. They evidently embody a most distinct and\r\nadmirable enumeration of the general facts with which the practical\r\nphysician ought to make himself acquainted.\r\n\r\n[724] We learn from the Commentary of Galen that some of the older\r\ncritics supposed that the sixteen cases about to be related had been\r\nselected by Hippocrates in illustration of his doctrines, as laid\r\ndown in the preceding description of what is generally entitled the\r\nPestilential Season. Galen, however, does not incline to this opinion.\r\n\r\n[725] This is an example of one of those protracted fevers of an\r\nintermittent type, which, as I have been informed by an intelligent\r\nphysician who practiced for several years in the Ionian Islands, are so\r\ncommon in the climate of Greece. There is not much of any particular\r\nvalue in Galen’s Commentary on this case. He informs us that one\r\nof the older commentators absurdly maintained the opinion that the\r\ncountry of this patient was given because, according to Asclepiades,\r\nthe inhabitants of Paros were most especially benefited by bleeding.\r\nBut, as Galen says, this remark is particularly out of place here,\r\nsince no mention of venesection occurs in the report. Galen, and after\r\nhim Foës, have given very lengthy and elaborate disquisitions on the\r\nnature of oily urine. The result is, that it is an unfavorable, but not\r\nnecessarily a fatal, character. It is minutely described by the later\r\nauthorities on urology, namely, Theophilus and Actuarius. See also the\r\nCommentary on PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book II., 14, Sydenham Society’s\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n[726] This appears clearly to be a case of fever, complicated with, but\r\nnot produced by parturition. Galen, however, seems to ascribe the fever\r\nand its fatal results to the retention of the lochial discharge. The\r\ncharacters of the urine, he properly remarks, are unfavorable, being\r\ncopious, thin, and black. He also calls attention to the want of proper\r\nconcoction in the sputa, to which he attributes the fatal relapse.\r\n\r\n[727] Galen’s Commentary on this case is written in his usual light\r\nand diffuse style, but contains very little which is calculated to\r\nthrow light on the text, or on the nature of the disease which is here\r\ndescribed. If any one find difficulty in comprehending the characters\r\nof the respiration, as given in this narrative, he can turn to Galen’s\r\nwork, On Difficulty of Breathing, where they are explained very\r\nfully. I may just mention that by shortness of breath (βραχύπνοος)\r\nwas understood, by Hippocrates and Galen, frequency of the act of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\n[728] This case, as Galen remarks, is an instance of the most acute\r\nform of phrenitis. He states that he himself had met with cases of\r\nphrenitis in which the patients had died on the fourth and fifth day,\r\nbut that he had never seen a case which proved so suddenly fatal as the\r\npresent one. He further makes some very interesting reflections on the\r\nsuddenness of the attack in such cases, which is the more wonderful, as\r\nthe exciting cause of them must be gradually collecting in the system,\r\nand acquiring strength and intensity, and it is singular that it should\r\nthen be developed all at once, and cut off the patient in a very short\r\ntime, as if he had swallowed poison, or had been stung by a venomous\r\nanimal. He compares the latency of the febrile humor in the system to\r\nthat of the mad dog, which will remain for a long time in the body of\r\na person who had been bitten, and then all at once will manifest its\r\neffects, by inducing the rage. For the ancient views on the subject\r\nof Hydrophobia, see PAULUS ÆGINETA, Book V., 4, Sydenham\r\nSociety’s edition.\r\n\r\n[729] Galen, in his Commentary on this case, enters into a train\r\nof reflections how a physician ought to proceed when called in to\r\na patient so circumstanced. He ought, in the first place, as the\r\nCommentator properly remarks, to make careful inquiry, in order to\r\nfind out whether the pain in the limb be occasioned by any external\r\ncause, as persons often meet with local injuries by sudden twisting\r\nand movements of their limbs, or even by laying a limb uncomfortably\r\nin bed, without being aware of it. When no such cause of the complaint\r\ncan be discovered, Galen says the physician should try to ascertain\r\nwhether or not it be connected with the regimen or temperament of the\r\npatient. If it shall turn out that the body is in a plethoric state,\r\ngeneral bleeding must be had recourse to, before any local applications\r\nare made to the part. It is then to be fomented, and liquid and heating\r\nmedicines applied to it. Whether or not this was the mode of treatment\r\nwhich Hippocrates adopted in this case, Galen cannot take upon himself\r\nto affirm, as no mention is made in the report of venesection, nor of\r\nthe particular remedies which were used. I am of opinion that this\r\nis one of the most interesting cases in the whole Collection, for I\r\nbelieve it to be a faithful report of a disease which on three several\r\noccasions I have met with during an active professional practice of\r\nthirty years, and which I have not seen described elsewhere. In all\r\nmy cases, indeed, the patients were from twelve to sixteen years old,\r\nbut in other respects the symptoms were the same as here described by\r\nHippocrates. In every one of the cases the patient was seized with pain\r\nand swelling of the thigh, attended with high fever, great jactitation,\r\nand partial delirium. They all proved fatal in the course of three or\r\nfour days. Whether the disease be connected with diffuse inflammation\r\nof the areolar substance, or with inflammation of the veins, or whether\r\nit be a general fever complicated with a local affection of the limb,\r\nor what may be the exact nature of the affection, I have not been able\r\nto determine. From what is stated above, it will be clearly seen how\r\njustly Hippocrates deserves the compliment paid to him by Galen, of\r\nhaving been, of all medical authorities, the most careful in observing\r\nthe phenomena of disease. (Opera Galeni, tom. vii., p. 829, ed. Kühn.)\r\n\r\n[730] Galen remarks, that this is one of those cases which appear\r\nformidable to the inexperienced, but which those who are practiced in\r\nthe art judge of as being likely to come to a speedy crisis. He adverts\r\nto the slight swelling of the spleen and the characters of the urine,\r\nwhich soon showed a proper sediment, as being particularly favorable\r\nsymptoms. The more that we study Hippocratic medicine, we shall be the\r\nmore convinced that too little attention has been paid of late years to\r\nthe physical characters of the urine in all febrile complaints.\r\n\r\n[731] Galen’s Commentary on this case is unusually brief. He holds it\r\nto be a case connected with general plethora, as indicated by the good\r\ncolor of the urine. He once more makes the remark that a favorable\r\nissue of the case might have been anticipated, from the characters of\r\nthe urine.\r\n\r\n[732] Galen remarks in his Commentary, that of all the cases related\r\nin the First and Third Books of the Epidemics, this is the only one\r\nin which Hippocrates says that the patient was bled, not, he adds,\r\nthat this was the only case in which venesection was adopted, but\r\nbecause, although the general rule was not to bleed after the fourth\r\nday, the patient, in the present instance, was bled on the eighth. Many\r\nothers, he says, were no doubt bled on the second, third, and fourth\r\ndays, but of these bleedings, and the other means used, Hippocrates in\r\ngeneral takes no notice, except that he sometimes states, in order to\r\nrender the malignity of the disease more apparent, that it was nowise\r\nbenefited by the remedies applied. In other cases he adds, he would\r\nappear, from the words he uses (such as “as far as I am aware”), not to\r\nhave attended the patient at the commencement. Galen further directs\r\nattention to the characters of the expectoration, the concoction of\r\nwhich he looks upon as having proved the means of carrying off this\r\nfever. Galen has reviewed the symptoms of this case very fully, and\r\nin a most interesting manner, in the Second Book of his work, On\r\nDifficulty of Breathing, see ed. Kühn, tom. vii., p. 854, etc. That it\r\nwas a case of fever complicated with pleurisy seems clear, as Galen\r\nremarks. Galen further treats of the characters of the sputa in this\r\ncase, in the First Book of his work, On Crises. Upon reference to\r\nthe edition of Littré, it will be seen that unfortunately there is\r\nconsiderable variation in the readings of this passage.\r\n\r\n[733] On this case Galen makes the remark that this patient must have\r\nhad a strong constitution, otherwise it could not have withstood such\r\nan affection. He adds that, moreover, his pulse must have possessed\r\nstrength, but that, as formerly said by him, this department of\r\nprognostics is altogether omitted by Hippocrates, in his reports of\r\nfebrile cases. He further remarks that the respiration and appetite\r\nwere not to complain of, and the only bad symptom was the thinness and\r\nblackness of the urine, which therefore required a long time for nature\r\nto overcome, by occasioning hemorrhage, pain of the hip-joint, and\r\ndetermination downwards. He adds, that great diseases require decided\r\ncrises, and that even with those now mentioned, the disease was not\r\nentirely removed in this case, until concoction in the urine took place.\r\n\r\n[734] Galen passes over this case without any remark worth mentioning.\r\nI cannot but think that the abundant sediment in the urine, which\r\npreceded the favorable crisis, is a fact in the case well deserving to\r\nbe noticed. Galen, however, in the present instance, omits all notice\r\nof it, and ascribes the recovery to the profuse sweat.\r\n\r\n[735] The only thing of importance in Galen’s Commentary on this case\r\nis the remark that this woman’s melancholy was most probably connected\r\nwith suppression of the menses, and that to this cause the dark color\r\nof the urine in the present instance is most probably to be ascribed.\r\nTo the critical evacuations by the sweat and menstruation he attributes\r\nthe recovery.\r\n\r\n[736] There were several ancient cities of this name, but there can\r\nbe no doubt that the one here referred to is the celebrated city of\r\nThessaly. See Strabo, Geograph. ix.\r\n\r\n[737] Galen considers it a remarkable feature in this case that\r\nalthough the crisis occurred on the sixth day, there was no relapse.\r\nThe recovery he ascribes to the copious menstruation which then took\r\nplace for the first time. He also calls attention to the characters of\r\nthe urine, which, he says, are those which usually accompany delirium,\r\nalthough this is omitted in the Prognostics.\r\n\r\n[738] Galen, in his Commentary, merely remarks that Hippocrates, at\r\nthe conclusion of the report, briefly enumerates the more prominent\r\nsymptoms from which a fatal result might have been confidently\r\nprognosticated. By enlarged viscera, in this case, we are informed by\r\nGalen in another place, that our author meant inflammation and swelling\r\n(Comment. in Rat. Vict. in Acut. c. iii.) There can be no doubt that\r\nby viscera Hippocrates meant the liver and spleen (see the work just\r\nreferred to). Galen briefly remarks on this case towards the end of the\r\nSecond Book of his work, On Difficulty of Breathing.\r\n\r\n[739] Cyzicus was a flourishing city on the Propontis. See Strabo,\r\nGeogr. xii.; and Pliny, H. N. v. 32.\r\n\r\n[740] Galen, in his Commentary, accounts for this fatal disease upon\r\nthe supposition that the uterus was inflamed, and affected the brain by\r\nsympathy, hence maniacal delirium and convulsions were the consequence.\r\nGalen, both in his Commentary, and in his work On Crises, refers to\r\nthis case, in confirmation of his doctrine of critical days.\r\n\r\n[741] I will venture to affirm, without much fear of contradiction,\r\nthat in all the works on medicine, both ancient and modern, there\r\nis not to be found so vivid a delineation of the symptoms of fever,\r\ncomplicated with effusion on the brain. Those who have added new\r\nfeatures to the picture, have thereby detracted from the general\r\neffect. Galen, in his Commentary, insists more especially on the\r\ncharacter of the respiration, but there does not appear to me to be any\r\nparticular obscurity about it. He also touches on this case towards the\r\nend of the Second Book, On Difficulty of Breathing. After reading all\r\nhis prolix disquisition on the subject, one does not feel much better\r\ninstructed on the subject. Galen, at times, nay, very frequently, seems\r\nto forget a favorite saying of his own, namely. that he who would wish\r\nto lay in a copious store of knowledge during life, should trouble\r\nhimself little about words, and attend principally to things.\r\n\r\n[742] There were two Thessalian cities of this name, the one in\r\nEstiæotis, and the other in Magnesia. This would appear to be the\r\nlatter. See Pliny, H. N. iv., 9; and Livy, xliv., 13.\r\n\r\n[743] Galen’s Commentary contains few observations of much interest,\r\nand which are not sufficiently obvious. Excesses in drinking and\r\ndebauchery, he remarks, hurt the nerves and the origin of them, that\r\nis to say, the brain. Thus he accounts for the delirium with which\r\nthis case of fever was attended. All the other prominent symptoms,\r\nsuch as the palpitation in the epigastric region, the swelling of\r\nthe hypochondrium, and the like, were noticed previously. Galen\r\nalso reviews the symptoms of this case in his work On Difficulty of\r\nBreathing, II.\r\n\r\n[744] “Hippocrates qui tam fallere quam falli nescit.” (Macrobius in\r\nSomn.

In reference to this description, it is\r\nstated by Vesalius, who in the course of his life had examined a great\r\nnumber of crania, that it is very rare indeed to meet with a skull in\r\nwhich the sutures are wanting. He accounts for the statement made by\r\nHerodotus (Hist. ix.) and Aristotle (1. c.), respecting skulls without\r\nsutures, upon the supposition that the observations of these authors\r\nmust have been made upon those of old persons, in whom the sutures are\r\noften very indistinct.

The exact meaning of this term is well defined by\r\nEustathius in his Commentary on Homer (ad Iliad., ii., 219), ό ἐις\r\nὀξὺ λήγονσαν ἔχων τὴν κεφαλήν. It is excellently expressed by Damm as\r\nfollows: “One whose head diminishes towards the top like a sugar-loaf.”\r\n(Lexicon Homericum in voce Φοεός.)\r\n\r\n[751] De Usu Partium, ix., 17.\r\n\r\n[752] Surgery, v., 4.\r\n\r\n[753] Chirurg.

See the Cyclopædia of Anatomy, vol. i., p. 745.\r\n\r\n[755] Comment. de Ossibus.\r\n\r\n[756] Obs. Anatom.\r\n\r\n[757] This letter was very varied in form. See Galen and Foës.\r\n\r\n[758] The operation consisted in sawing the bone nearly through, and\r\nleaving it in this state until it exfoliated, or until the bone could\r\nbe separated from the dura mater without violence. See below.\r\n\r\n[759] It is no doubt true that a simple cut in the outer table of the\r\nbone, when accompanied with concussion or contusion, may produce fatal\r\neffects within, and this, in fact, is stated by our author; but, of\r\nitself, as he says, the simple incision or _hedra_ cannot be of a\r\ndangerous nature, nor require any recourse to instruments. The cases\r\nrelated by M. Littré in the Argument were all evidently complicated\r\nwith contusion, and are thus referable to the second class of these\r\ninjuries. It is most worthy of remark, that in the very interesting\r\naccount of “slicing cuts,” given in Mr. Guthrie’s excellent work, On\r\nInjuries of the Head, the result, without any operation, by the most\r\nsimple system of treatment, was in general very favorable. (pp. 95,\r\n96.) On these cuts and superficial injuries of the skull, see further\r\nHennen (pp. 283, 284), Thomson (pp. 51, 52), and Chelius (vol. i., p.\r\n388).\r\n\r\n[760] London and Edinburgh Medical Journal, 1844.\r\n\r\n[761] Although, as we have stated, Dr. Laurie’s rule of practice now\r\nbe to use the trephine on the preventive principle, it is probable\r\nthat most of his cases occurred at a period when the practice of Mr.\r\nAbernethy was universally followed. His statistics therefore are no\r\ntest of the results of the operation, when performed on the preventive\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\n[762] See Lawrence’s Clinical Lecture in the Medical Gazette, vol.\r\nxxi., p. 345; and Guthrie’s work, On Injuries of the Head, p. 113.\r\n\r\n[763] See De Articulis, § 50; and Mochlicus, § 36.\r\n\r\n[764] On hypertrophy and swelling of the brain after injuries, see\r\nthe very interesting observations made by Mr. Guthrie, in his work on\r\nInjuries of the Head, p. 125.\r\n\r\n[765] It is proper to mention in this place that Quesnay, with great\r\ngood sense, discusses the question, whether or nor the separation of\r\nthe pericrunium in this case be a sure indication of matter being\r\ncollected within the cranium. He decides in the negative. (p. 17, Syd.\r\nSoc. edition of Selected Mem. of the Acad. of Surgery.)\r\n\r\n[766] I ought to mention, however, in this place, that in simple\r\nundepressed fractures, Pott allows of the operation as a preventive;\r\nthat, at least, is one of his objects in having recourse to the\r\noperation. (p. 130.)\r\n\r\n[767] Ambrose Paré expresses very strongly the difficulty of forming a\r\ncorrect prognosis in injuries of the head: “Ex quo intelligere licet,\r\nmultos ab exiguis vulneribus mortem oppetere, alios ex ingentibus et\r\npenitus magnis desperatisque convalescere.” (Opera, ix., 9.)\r\n\r\n[768] Injuries of the Head, p. 148.\r\n\r\n[769] Aphor. v., 68.\r\n\r\n[770] See the Argument to the treatise, On Regimen in Acute Diseases.\r\n\r\n[771] Opera, ix., 10.\r\n\r\n[772] Sir Astley Cooper mentions an instance in which 208 ounces of\r\nblood were abstracted from a patient!! In Quesnay’s Memoir there is\r\nnothing more common than to find it reported that he had bled a patient\r\nthree or four times in the course of a day. In one case 160 ounces were\r\ntaken in nine days; “but,” it is gravely added, “two years elapsed\r\nbefore she was quite well again.”\r\n\r\n[773] IV., 5, 3, 1.\r\n\r\n[774] The principles upon which depletion by bleeding and purging\r\nshould be regulated are fully stated and discussed by Galen, in the\r\nFourth Book of his great work on Therapeutics. The rule is briefly\r\ngiven by Hippocrates in his Second Aphorism: “respect being paid to\r\nplace, season, age, and the disease in which it is proper or not.”\r\n\r\n[775] See Aphor. v., 18, 22; and § 12 of this treatise. The\r\nprofessional authorities of the present day are not agreed as to the\r\nexpediency of using poultices or cold lotions in injuries of the scalp.\r\nGuthrie and Hennen recommend the latter; but South, in the edition of\r\nChelius, prefers the former.\r\n\r\n[776] This is related of Philagrius in a very interesting scholium on\r\nthe Aphorism just quoted. See Scholia in Hippocrat. et Galen., tom.\r\nii., p. 457; ed. Dietz.\r\n\r\n[777] Perhaps the meaning here is, that when the forehead is much\r\nelevated, and the occiput much depressed, if one looks down upon the\r\nskull from above, the sagittal and coronal sutures will present the\r\nappearance of the letter Τ.\r\n\r\n[778] The meaning, I suppose, may be, that when the forehead is very\r\nlow, and when the occiput is protuberant, if one looks down upon the\r\nskull from above, the sagittal and lambdoidal sutures will present the\r\nappearance of the letter Τ reversed.\r\n\r\n[779] The meaning would appear to be, that in a square-built head, that\r\nis to say, when it is prominent both before and behind, the coronal and\r\nsagittal sutures run nearly parallel to one another, and the sagittal\r\nconnects them together in the middle. In this case they would present\r\nthe appearance of the letter Η reversed.\r\n\r\n[780] Perhaps this alludes to the form of the head in which the\r\nsagittal suture passes through the middle of the os frontis down to the\r\nnose, in which case we may imagine that the coronal suture intersects\r\nthe lambdoidal in such a manner as to have some resemblance to the\r\nletter χ. It is to be borne in mind, that the character of this letter\r\nwas very variable in ancient writing. Ruffus Ephesius describes the\r\nsagittal suture as sometimes passing down the middle of the frontal\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n[781] This passage was considered by Scaliger as a gloss, but as\r\ninterpreted by M. Littré, whom I have followed, the meaning is quite\r\nsuitable. See his note, h. 1.\r\n\r\n[782] It is difficult to say what can be meant by caruncles in this\r\nplace, but still I agree with M. Littré that Scaliger was not warranted\r\nin proposing to eject the passage from the text as an interpolation.\r\nUnless the _glandulæ Pacchioni_ are meant (and the description\r\nmust be admitted not to be quite applicable to them), I cannot pretend\r\nto explain or account for the description.\r\n\r\n[783] I need scarcely remark, that if by this is strictly meant that\r\nwounds in the posterior part of the head are less dangerous than those\r\nin the anterior, the statement is at variance with the experience of\r\ncertain modern authorities. See, in particular, Pott and Liston, p.\r\n46. At the same time, it is, no doubt, anatomically correct, that\r\nthe occipital bone can bear more violence, without being seriously\r\nfractured, than the frontal or parietal bones, and it is worthy of\r\nremark, that the views and experience of Mr. Guthrie are very consonant\r\nwith those of Hippocrates. He says: “The result of my experience on\r\nthis point is, that brain is more rarely lost from the fore part of\r\nthe head with impunity, than from the middle part; and that a fracture\r\nof the skull, with even a lodgment of a foreign body, and a portion\r\nof the bone in the brain, may be sometimes borne without any great\r\ninconvenience in the back part.... I have never seen a person live with\r\na foreign body lodged in the anterior lobe of the brain, although I\r\nhave seen several recover with the loss of a portion of the brain at\r\nthis part. My experience, then, leads me to believe, that an injury of\r\napparently equal extent is more dangerous on the forehead than on the\r\nside or middle of the head, and much less so on the back part than on\r\nthe side. A fracture of the vertex is of infinitely less importance\r\nthan one of the base of the cranium, which, although not necessarily\r\nfatal, is always attended with the utmost danger.” (On Injuries of the\r\nHead, p. 3.) I feel difficulty in reconciling these discordant results\r\nof modern experience. Perhaps the fact of the matter is, that injuries\r\non the upper part of the occipital region are the least dangerous of\r\nany, whereas those in the lower part of it, are particularly fatal.\r\n\r\n[784] Vidus Vidius thus explains the _hedra_ or _sedes_:\r\n“Inciditur os ita ut teli vestigium remaneat, quod genus fracturæ\r\nappellatur a Hippocrate ἒδρα, id est sedes, quum (ut ipse inquit)\r\nappareat in osse qua telum insederit; fit autem ab acuto telo, quod\r\net ipse in sequentibus, et Galenus, in Commentario, in librum memoriæ\r\nprodidit, quum sub telo acuto incidi os dixit. Requirit autem sedes\r\nut incisum os nullo modo ad cerebri membranam inclinatur.” (Chirurg.\r\nGræc., p. 71.) Andreas à Cruce defines it thus: “Potissimum vero sedes\r\nvocatur ubi osse in suo statu remanente qua parte telum insederit\r\napparet.” (De Vulneribus, 1. 2.) By _hedra_ would appear to have\r\nbeen understood a dint, or impression, left in a bone by a blow which\r\nhas not produced fracture or depression. It was also applied to a cut\r\nor slash affecting only the outer plate of the skull. Hippocrates, it\r\nwill be remarked, pronounces this sort of injury not to be dangerous\r\nof itself, but M. Littré relates a case taken from the “Journal de\r\nMédecine,” in which a sabre-cut, which only penetrated through the\r\nexternal plate of the cranium, and did not touch the internal, proved\r\nfatal. (Op. Hippocrat. iii., p. 170.) Our author, in the latter\r\npart of this paragraph, mentions cursorily injury of the skull at\r\na suture, and more circumstantially in the twelfth paragraph. This\r\naccident is very correctly described by the later writers, under the\r\nname of _diastasis_. See Heliodorus (ap. Chirurg. Veteres, p.\r\n100), and Archigenes (ibid., p. 117). Pott declares that he did not\r\nremember having ever seen a single instance of recovery when there\r\nwas separation of the bones at a suture. Morgagni, in like manner,\r\nrepresents the case as being of a particularly serious character.\r\n(De Caus. et Sed. Morb.) I once saw a strongly marked case in which\r\nthere was a considerable separation of the bones at the upper part\r\nof the temporal suture, along with an extensive wound, unguardedly\r\ninflicted by the scalpel of a juvenile surgeon, in order to explore\r\nthe nature of the accident. As might have been expected, under these\r\ncircumstances, the case had a fatal issue. Mr. Guthrie writes thus of\r\n_diastasis_: “It is well known, that when a violent shock has been\r\nreceived on the head, particularly by a fall on the vertex, the sutures\r\nare often separated to a considerable extent; _these cases usually\r\nterminate fatally_.” (p. 135.)\r\n\r\n[785] The meaning here is somewhat obscure, but as Arantius states in\r\nhis commentary on this tract, our author probably means that a fissure\r\nis necessarily complicated with a contusion, or, in other words, that\r\nthere can be no fissure without contusion.\r\n\r\n[786] Arantius and Porralius, in their conjoined commentary on this\r\ntreatise, mention that in contusion sometimes only the outer plate of\r\nthe skull is contused, but the inner is depressed upon the dura mater.\r\nThis is a case of which we have examples in modern surgery; but it\r\ndoes not appear clearly to be alluded to in this place by our author.\r\nMr. Guthrie, indeed, understands the ἀπήχημα of the Greek authors, and\r\n_resonitus_ of the Latin, to apply to this variety of fracture;\r\nbut he appears to me to be mistaken, for these terms unquestionable\r\nrefer to the _contre-coup_, of which we will treat presently.\r\nQuesnay, indeed, uses the term _contre-coup_ in this double sense,\r\nbut, as I think, very injudiciously, as it tends to introduce confusion\r\nof ideas; for assuredly the case of a fracture on a different part of\r\nthe head from that which received the blow, and a fracture on the inner\r\nplate of the skull from an injury on the outer, are quite different\r\ncases. See Quesnay, etc., p. 20, Syd. Soc. edit.\r\n\r\n[787] The expressions in this place are somewhat confused, but the\r\nmeaning evidently is, that without fracture there can be no depression.\r\n\r\n[788] This third mode of fracture is thus defined by Celsus: “At ubi\r\nmedium desedit, eandem cerebri membranam os urget; interdum etiam ex\r\nfractura quibusdam velut aculeis pungentibus,” (viii., 4.) Hippocrates,\r\nit will be remarked, makes no mention of spiculæ in his description of\r\ndepression. Galen describes two varieties of depression; in the one\r\nthe depressed portion retains its situation, and in the other it rises\r\nagain to its former level. (De Caus. Morb.) Hippocrates does not appear\r\nto have been acquainted with the latter. Modern experience has shown\r\nthat it sometimes occurs in children.\r\n\r\n[789] It is almost impossible to know what to make of this passage,\r\nowing to the corrupt state of the text.\r\n\r\n[790] The nature of this mode of injury is explained in the annotations\r\non the third paragraph. It does not appear clear why our author has\r\ngiven two separate descriptions of this injury. He describes, it will\r\nbe remarked, several varieties of it, according as it is complicated\r\nor not with contusion and fracture. Galen uses _hedra_ in one\r\nplace. (Meth. Med. vi.) The term _hedra_ is rendered _teli\r\nsedes_ by the Latin translators of the Greek medical authors. (See\r\nAsellii Comment. in Hippocrat. de Vuln. Capit.) It is used also by\r\nAmbrose Paré, Wiseman, and all our earlier writers on surgery. Wiseman\r\nthinks the term most appropriate when applied to wounds inflicted by a\r\npole-axe, halberd, or the like. (v. 9.) Paré applies it to a kind of\r\ninjury, in which the bone is not broken through, but the print of the\r\nweapon is left on the skull. (xx., 7.) Fallopius gives an interesting\r\ndiscussion on it. (In librum Hippocrat. de Vuln. Capit.) The term\r\nincision, borrowed from Paulus Ægineta, has been since used in its\r\nstead. See Quesnay, on the Use of the Trepan, p. 29, Syd. Soc. edition;\r\nand on simple incisions or sabre-cuts, see, in particular, Mr. Guthrie,\r\nInjuries of the Head, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[791] This, it will readily be perceived, is the _fractura per\r\nresonitum_, that is to say, the _fracture par contre-coup_, or\r\ncounter-fissure of modern authorities. Except Paulus Ægineta, I am not\r\naware that any of the ancient authorities question the occurrence of\r\nthis species of the accident, and with the exception of Vidus Vidius,\r\nGuido, Fallopius, and Dinus de Garbo, it is generally recognized by the\r\nbest modern authorities, from Bertaphalia and Andreas à Cruce, down\r\nto Sir Astley Cooper and Mr. Liston. Mr. Guthrie, indeed, remarks,\r\nthat in recent times there has been no well-authenticated instance of\r\nfracture on the one side of the head from a blow on the other. Such\r\ncases, however, are not wanting in the works of the earlier modern\r\nauthorities. Quesnay writes thus: “We find in authors, also, many\r\ncases of fracture by _contre-coup_, from one part of the head\r\nto the part opposite: and in honor of the ancients we may cite the\r\ncase related by Amatus, who applied the trepan to the part of the\r\nhead opposite to the wound, when he found that the symptoms were not\r\nrelieved by applying it on the side wounded, and that the patient\r\nsuffered from severe pain on the other side. This second trepan\r\nproved very apropos, for it allowed the escape of pus, which had\r\ncollected under the skull.” (On the use of the Trepan.) All our modern\r\nauthorities, including Mr. Guthrie, admit the reality of the case in\r\nwhich fracture of the base of the skull is produced by a blow on the\r\nupper part of the head. In imitation of our author, this case was\r\ndenominated “infortunium” by the earlier authorities, such as Asellius\r\nand Porralius, being accounted an irremediable misfortune, because its\r\nseat could not be detected; and it is noticed in the following terms by\r\nSir Astley Cooper, who did not trouble himself much about the writings\r\nof his predecessors, but formed his opinions from actual observation:\r\n“When the basis of the skull is fractured from a high fall, from the\r\nwhole pressure of the body resting upon that part, on opening the brain\r\nand tearing up the dura mater, extravasated blood is commonly observed;\r\n_this kind of fracture must inevitably prove fatal, nor can it be\r\ndiscovered till after death_.” (Lectures, xiii.)\r\n\r\n[792] Whatever opinion may now be formed of the rule of practice here\r\nlaid down, all must admit that it is clearly stated and distinctly\r\ndefined. We have seen above that our author describes five modes of\r\ninjury in the skull, namely, the incision or indentation, confined\r\nto its outer table; the contusion; the direct fracture; the fracture\r\n_par contre-coup_; and the depression. He now states decidedly\r\nthat it is only in the case of contusion and simple fracture, that the\r\ntrepan can be applied with advantage. I have entered so fully into the\r\n_rationale_ of this practice in the Argument, that I do not think\r\nit necessary to say more on the subject in this place.\r\n\r\n[793] This passage indicates strongly our author’s partiality for\r\nprognostics, or rather, I should say, for prorrhetics. It would appear\r\nto have been a primary consideration with him, in all cases, to secure\r\nthe physician from blame, and to teach him how to gain the confidence\r\nof the patient and his attendants. Few who have practiced medicine\r\nfor a great many years, will question the propriety of these rules\r\nof conduct, or doubt the importance of taking all honorable steps to\r\nensure the confidence and good-will of patients and their friends.\r\n\r\n[794] There is a remark made by Arantius and Porralius on the latter\r\npart of this paragraph, which, although it appears to be scarcely\r\nwarranted by anything in the text of our author, I quote for its\r\nimportance, as showing that the earlier authorities were well aware of\r\nthe danger and impropriety of treating injuries of the head in children\r\nby instruments: “Sed præ ceteris illud notandum quod dixerit (_nudato\r\nosse_) quasi dicat, eo non denudato quamvis calliso aut fisso, quod\r\nraro accidit, non esse tamen sectione denudandam calvariam: nam in\r\npueris, ubi decidunt non raro accidit ut eorum collidatur calvaria,\r\nfrangaturque, cute integra, quod etsi accidat, et tactu hoc probe\r\nprecipiatur, sanguisque e venis effusus sub cute fluctua, abstinendum\r\ntamen a sectione est, neminem enim servatum vidi, cui sectio adhibita\r\nsit, propterea quod eorum calor facile dissipetur, eoque magis, quum\r\ngemitu et clamore caput valdè incelescat, et ad fluxiones suscipiendas\r\nproclive reddatur,” (Comm. in Hip. de Vuln. Cap.) It will be seen at\r\n§ 18, that our author allowed the application of a small trepan in\r\nchildren when strongly indicated.\r\n\r\n[795] This passage is rendered as follows by Celsus: “Igitur, ubi\r\nea percussa, protinus requirendum est, num bilem is homo vomuerit;\r\nnum oculi ejus obcæcati sint; num obmutuerit; num per nores auresque\r\nsanguis ei effiuxerit: num conciderit, num sine sensu quasi dormiens\r\njacuerit. Hæc enim non nisi osse fracto eveniunt; atque, ubi\r\ninciderunt, scire licet, necessariam, sed difficilem curationem\r\nesse.” (viii., 4.) Now, although it is no doubt true, as remarked by\r\nPott (Injuries of the Head, § 4), that these symptoms sometimes take\r\nplace, without there being any fracture of the skull, and that, on the\r\nother hand, as had been previously pointed out by Paré and Le Dran,\r\nfractures do sometimes take place without being accompanied by all\r\nthese symptoms, still there can be no doubt that as a general rule\r\nthe doctrine of Celsus is correct, and that, at all events, a case is\r\nto be treated as serious in which these symptoms occur. With regard\r\nto one of the characteristics of a fracture, thus noticed by Celsus,\r\na modern authority of great experience, but little acquaintance with\r\nancient learning, observes, “Blood flowing from the nose and ears is a\r\nsymptom attending fracture of the skull. It may be consequent on mere\r\nconcussion, a vibration which ruptures the membranes; but oftener it is\r\na consequence of fissure across the bone.” (Institutes of Surgery, by\r\nSir Charles Bell, vol., i, p. 173.)\r\n\r\n[796] The separation of the bones at a suture, usually called\r\n_diastasis_, is noticed in the annotations on § 8. I have also\r\nalluded, in my analysis of the Fifth Book of the Epidemics, to the case\r\nin which the author, generally supposed by ancient authorities to be\r\nHippocrates, mistook a suture for a fracture of the skull. See Epidem.\r\nv., 14; and Celsus, viii., 4.\r\n\r\n[797] On the terms which occur parenthetically, the philological reader\r\nmay consult the note of Stephanus, contained in the edition of Erotian\r\nby Franzius, under ἑδράιως. I may here remark, that it is difficult to\r\naccount for the frequent repetition of these words in parentheses.\r\n\r\n[798] It will be remarked that, as a general rule, Hippocrates forbids\r\nus to apply the trepan at the sutures, but, notwithstanding this\r\nprohibition, it would appear to have been departed from in two cases\r\nrelated in the Sixth Book of the Epidemics. (See § 27 and 28.) The\r\nrule, however, to avoid the application of the trepan at the sutures,\r\nwas generally observed by nearly all the modern authorities down to\r\nPott, and even he admits that the sutures should be avoided when the\r\ntrephine may with equal utility be set on any other part. Louis, in\r\na paper lately reprinted from the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of\r\nSurgery, by the Sydenham Society, gives an interesting examination\r\nof the doctrine of the ancient and modern authors on this rule of\r\npractice. Most of the authorities quoted by him are averse to the\r\napplication of the trepan over sutures, except when very urgently\r\nrequired. C. Porralius, in his marginal notes on Arantius’s Commentary\r\non this work of Hippocrates, assigns three reasons for avoiding the\r\nsutures in this operation: 1st, because the bone is weak at that place;\r\n2dly, because the membrane there being in close connection with the\r\nbone, is in danger of being injured; 3dly, because, by the contraction\r\nof the callus, the transpiration there will be stopped. The last of\r\nthese reasons is based on the physiological doctrine of the ancient\r\nauthorities respecting the uses of the sutures, one of which was, to\r\npermit transpiration from the brain. See Galen, de Usu Partium, ix., 1,\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[799] Our author, it will be remarked, forbids liquid applications,\r\ntents, cataplasms, and bandages, in wounds of the head. He seems to\r\nhave approved most of things of a drying nature. The other authorities\r\nwould appear to differ considerably in their views regarding the proper\r\nprinciples upon which wounds on the head are to be treated. Celsus\r\ndirects us, after laying bare the dura mater by trepanning, to apply\r\nstrong vinegar to it, and when the membrane is inflamed, he approves of\r\ntepid rose-water. (viii., 4.) Paulus Ægineta, after the operation of\r\ntrepanning, directs a piece of cloth, or small ball of wool dipped in\r\noil, to be applied to the part. I believe they all agreed in rejecting\r\nsutures. See Galen, de Med. sec. Genera III.\r\n\r\n[800] Hippocrates would seem to hold the fanciful idea, that the\r\nforehead is environed by the rest of the head, and that afflux of blood\r\ntakes place from the parts around to it. Scaliger rejects this passage\r\nas containing a doctrine wholly unworthy of our author.\r\n\r\n[801] The danger of incisions, in the temporal region, is adverted to\r\nin several parts of the Hippocratic Collection, as in the work On the\r\nArticulations, in the Prorrhetics, and the Coan Prænotions. Even at the\r\npresent day, when the treatment of hemorrhage is better understood than\r\nin the days of the great Fathers of Grecian medicine, a large incision\r\nin that quarter is regarded with considerable apprehension. Convulsion,\r\nthat is to say, tetanus, was supposed to be the frequent, if not the\r\ninvariable, result of a wound in the temporal muscle. Pott, indeed,\r\ncontends that lock-jaw is not necessarily produced by a wound there; he\r\nadmits, however, that the application of the trepan to the temple is\r\nnot often successful, but the reason of this he contends is, that in\r\nthese fractures the breach generally extends to the base of the skull\r\n(§ 5). Quesnay, however, inclines to support the views of Hippocrates.\r\n(On the Use of the Trepan, p. 15, Syd. Soc. edit.) Scultet, in like\r\nmanner, pronounces decidedly that a wound in the temple is a very\r\ndangerous affair. (Armam. Chirurg. Tabl. xxxi.)\r\n\r\n[802] The _maza_ was evidently a poultice prepared with barley-meal\r\nand vinegar, or water. See the Annotations on the treatise On Ancient\r\nMedicine.\r\n\r\n[803] Celsus translates this passage as follows: “At si ne tum quidem\r\nrima manifesta est, inducendum supra os atramentum scriptorium est,\r\ndeinde scalpro id deradendum; nigritiem enim continet, si quid fissum\r\nest.” (viii., 4.) Arantius properly remarks, that the ancient ink must\r\nnot be confounded with the modern, which is composed principally of\r\ncopperas and galls. It was, no doubt, the milder kind prepared from the\r\nsoot of pines with gum which was used in this case. On the writing-ink\r\nof the ancients, see Dioscorides (M. M., v., 182) and Pliny (H. N.,\r\nxxxv., 6).\r\n\r\n[804] The text in the beginning of this paragraph is in a very\r\nunsatisfactory state. It seems pretty clear, however, that in this\r\nplace our author describes caries of the bone brought on by an\r\nunhealthy state of the integuments. The description--allowance being\r\nmade for the corruption of the text--is sufficiently distinct, and\r\nmost probably has reference to that condition of the parts which is\r\nso graphically described by Pott as forming “a puffy, circumscribed,\r\nindolent tumour of the scalp, and a spontaneous separation of the\r\npericranium from the skull under such tumour.”\r\n\r\n[805] Our author in this place would appear to treat of incipient\r\nhernia cerebri, as immediately before he treats of fungous ulcers on\r\nthe pericranium. Galen in like manner, praises powerfully dessicant\r\nmedicines upon the authority of Meges the Sidonian, who, he says, had\r\ngreat experience in these cases. He speaks of the plaster called Isis\r\nas being a most efficacious application to the dura mater, when laid\r\nbare. Its principal ingredients are of an escharotic and detergent\r\nnature, such as squama æris, burnt copper, ammoniac salts, myrrh,\r\naloes, and the like. See PAULUS ÆGINETA, Vol. III., p. 564.\r\nGalen concludes his remarks on this subject with stating that, before\r\ngetting into an inflamed state, the dura mater, as being of a dry\r\nnature, endures the most powerful medicines. (Meth. Med., vi., at the\r\nend.)\r\n\r\n[806] This description of a piece of bone which is going to exfoliate,\r\nis remarkably correct. Compare it with the following narrative: “A\r\ngirl of ten or twelve years of age was struck on the head by an iron\r\nrod falling on her; the blow caused no wound, and the young woman was\r\nsoon well, with the exception of a fixed pain of no great extent, which\r\nremained over one of the parietal bones. The pain continued for several\r\nyears. M. Mareschal, who was at last consulted, considered it necessary\r\nto trepan. He exposed the bone at the painful part, and applied one\r\ncrown of a trepan; he observed, _that the bone, when sawed, appeared\r\ndry, like a skull that had been buried_.” (Quesnay, on the Use of\r\nthe Trepan.) This agrees excellently with the description given by\r\nHippocrates. It is to be regretted, however, that the text here; as\r\nfar as regards one word ἀποστρακὸς, is in a very unsatisfactory state.\r\nThe conjectural emendation of Schneider (ἀπεσκληκὸς) seems to be a\r\nplausible emendation, but it is not adopted by Littré.\r\n\r\n[807] Our author delivers the same doctrine in the work On the\r\nArticulations, and states that extensive fractures of the bones are\r\noften less dangerous than others which appear not so formidable. I\r\nneed scarcely remark that modern experience has confirmed the truth\r\nof this position. How often has it been seen that one patient died\r\nfrom a slight injury to the skull, while another recovered from an\r\nextensive fracture of it? Mr. Guthrie appears in so far to agree in\r\nopinion with our author, that extensive fractures are less dangerous\r\nthan they appear; he says, “Mr. Keate, who has had great opportunities\r\nfor observation in St. George’s Hospital, has invariably remarked that\r\nthe symptoms dependent on extravasation have been less severe in the\r\nfirst instance, in proportion as the separation of the edges of the\r\nfracture have been greater one from the other, or when the sutures have\r\nyielded to the shock and have been separated. It has been stated from\r\nthe earliest antiquity, that the greater the fracture, the less the\r\nconcussion of the brain.” (p. 56.) See the Argument.\r\n\r\n[808] It will be remarked as a striking feature in our author’s views\r\nof practice in injuries of the head, not to interfere with fractures\r\nattended with depression. See the Argument, where the rationale of this\r\npractice is fully discussed.\r\n\r\n[809] Although these directions of our author regarding the treatment\r\nof children be most important, I am not aware that any other of the\r\nancient authorities has shown his sense of their value of them by\r\nrepeating them. It is well known that in children there is but one\r\ntable, and that it is very thin. Our author, as remarked above, does\r\nnot entirely omit the operation in the case of children, but uses a\r\nsmall trepan.\r\n\r\n[810] The reader will again remark an instance of our author’s fondness\r\nfor prognosis, and his observance of the rule at all times to prevent\r\nthe surgeon from committing himself by attempting hopeless cases.\r\nCelsus, writing in the same spirit, says, “Ante omnia scire medicum\r\noportere, quæ vulnera insanabilia sint, quæ difficilem curationem\r\nhabeant; ... non attingere, _nec subire speciem ejus, ut occisi, quem\r\nsors ipsius intermit_.” (v., 26.)\r\n\r\n[811] This is an opinion held by all the ancient authorities. Some\r\ninteresting cases in point are related in the First Book of the\r\nContinens of Rhazes. It was explained on the principle that the\r\ncerebral nerves decussate. (See Aretæus, on the Causes of Disease, i.,\r\n7.) Modern experience, in the main, is in accordance with the ancient\r\non this point. Paralysis has generally been found on the opposite side\r\nto that which has received the injury. See Thomson’s Observations,\r\netc., p. 52; Larrey’s Mem. de Chirurg., iv., p. 180; Hennen’s\r\nPrinciples, p. 301.\r\n\r\n[812] This passage is thus translated by Celsus: “Si sub prima\r\ncuratione febris intenditur, brevesque somni, et iidem per summa\r\ntumultuosi sunt, ulcus madet, neque alitur, et in cervicibus glandulæ\r\noriuntur, magni dolores sunt, cibique super hoc fastidium increscit,\r\ntum demum ad manum scalprumque veniendum est.” (vii., 4.)\r\n\r\n[813] The practice advocated in this paragraph is alluded to by Paulus\r\nÆgineta, in his chapter on Fractures of the Skull. (vi., 90.)\r\n\r\n[814] The operation here described by our author is the more deserving\r\nof attention, as it appears to have been peculiar to him. It is not\r\ndescribed by Celsus, Paulus Ægineta, Albucasis, nor any one of the\r\nancient authorities, as far as I can find; neither am I aware of its\r\nhaving been attempted in modern times. The object of it, however, seems\r\nto be very rational, namely, to avoid doing serious injury to the dura\r\nmater by tearing the bone forcibly from it at once.\r\n\r\n[815] The instrument here used is named πρίων χαρακτὸς; and, as far as\r\nI can see, was the same as the modiolus of Celsus, and the χοινικὶς\r\nof the later authorities. It would certainly appear to have been a\r\ncircular saw, and consequently not unlike our modern trephine. See the\r\nfigures and the Argument.\r\n\r\n[816] The following sentence, taken from Sir Charles Bell’s description\r\nof the operation, looks like a translation of this passage of\r\nHippocrates; but it is well known that our English surgeon was not\r\nguilty of reading Greek! “Withdraw your trephine from time to time,\r\nbrush it, and run the flat probe round the circular cut.” The specillum\r\nof the ancient surgeons was, in most respects, not unlike our modern\r\nprobe.\r\n\r\n[817] The meaning here would seem to be, that the bone does not\r\nextend so deep as might be supposed.
