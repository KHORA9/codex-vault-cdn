MARTIN'S LANE, W.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following notes are by no means intended as a rule of thought by\r\nwhich nurses can teach themselves to nurse, still less as a manual to\r\nteach nurses to nurse. They are meant simply to give hints for thought\r\nto women who have personal charge of the health of others. Every woman,\r\nor at least almost every woman, in England has, at one time or another\r\nof her life, charge of the personal health of somebody, whether child or\r\ninvalid,--in other words, every woman is a nurse. Every day sanitary\r\nknowledge, or the knowledge of nursing, or in other words, of how to put\r\nthe constitution in such a state as that it will have no disease, or\r\nthat it can recover from disease, takes a higher place. It is recognized\r\nas the knowledge which every one ought to have--distinct from medical\r\nknowledge, which only a profession can have.\r\n\r\nIf, then, every woman must, at some time or other of her life, become a\r\nnurse, i.e., have charge of somebody's health, how immense and how\r\nvaluable would be the produce of her united experience if every woman\r\nwould think how to nurse.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to teach her how, I ask her to teach herself, and for\r\nthis purpose I venture to give her some hints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                                   PAGES\r\nVENTILATION AND WARMING                                                8\r\nHEALTH OF HOUSES                                                      14\r\nPETTY MANAGEMENT                                                      20\r\nNOISE                                                                 25\r\nVARIETY                                                               33\r\nTAKING FOOD                                                           36\r\nWHAT FOOD?                                                            39\r\nBED AND BEDDING                                                       45\r\nLIGHT                                                                 47\r\nCLEANLINESS OF ROOMS AND WALLS                                        49\r\nPERSONAL CLEANLINESS                                                  52\r\nCHATTERING HOPES AND ADVICES                                          54\r\nOBSERVATION OF THE SICK                                               59\r\nCONCLUSION                                                            71\r\nAPPENDIX                                                              77\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON NURSING:\r\n\r\nWHAT IT IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Disease a reparative process.]\r\n\r\nShall we begin by taking it as a general principle--that all disease, at\r\nsome period or other of its course, is more or less a reparative\r\nprocess, not necessarily accompanied with suffering: an effort of nature\r\nto remedy a process of poisoning or of decay, which has taken place\r\nweeks, months, sometimes years beforehand, unnoticed, the termination of\r\nthe disease being then, while the antecedent process was going on,\r\ndetermined?\r\n\r\nIf we accept this as a general principle we shall be immediately met\r\nwith anecdotes and instances to prove the contrary. Just so if we were\r\nto take, as a principle--all the climates of the earth are meant to be\r\nmade habitable for man, by the efforts of man--the objection would be\r\nimmediately raised,--Will the top of Mont Blanc ever be made habitable?\r\nOur answer would be, it will be many thousands of years before we have\r\nreached the bottom of Mont Blanc in making the earth healthy. Wait till\r\nwe have reached the bottom before we discuss the top.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Of the sufferings of disease, disease not always the cause.]\r\n\r\nIn watching disease, both in private houses and in public hospitals, the\r\nthing which strikes the experienced observer most forcibly is this, that\r\nthe symptoms or the sufferings generally considered to be inevitable and\r\nincident to the disease are very often not symptoms of the disease at\r\nall, but of something quite different--of the want of fresh air, or of\r\nlight, or of warmth, or of quiet, or of cleanliness, or of punctuality\r\nand care in the administration of diet, of each or of all of these. And\r\nthis quite as much in private as in hospital nursing.\r\n\r\nThe reparative process which Nature has instituted and which we call\r\ndisease has been hindered by some want of knowledge or attention, in one\r\nor in all of these things, and pain, suffering, or interruption of the\r\nwhole process sets in.\r\n\r\nIf a patient is cold, if a patient is feverish, if a patient is faint,\r\nif he is sick after taking food, if he has a bed-sore, it is generally\r\nthe fault not of the disease, but of the nursing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What nursing ought to do.]\r\n\r\nI use the word nursing for want of a better. It has been limited to\r\nsignify little more than the administration of medicines and the\r\napplication of poultices. It ought to signify the proper use of fresh\r\nair, light, warmth, cleanliness, quiet, and the proper selection and\r\nadministration of diet--all at the least expense of vital power to the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nursing the sick little understood.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said and written scores of times, that every woman makes a\r\ngood nurse. I believe, on the contrary, that the very elements of\r\nnursing are all but unknown.\r\n\r\nBy this I do not mean that the nurse is always to blame. Bad sanitary,\r\nbad architectural, and bad administrative arrangements often make it\r\nimpossible to nurse. But the art of nursing ought to include such\r\narrangements as alone make what I understand by nursing, possible.\r\n\r\nThe art of nursing, as now practised, seems to be expressly constituted\r\nto unmake what God had made disease to be, viz., a reparative process.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nursing ought to assist the reparative process.]\r\n\r\nTo recur to the first objection. If we are asked, Is such or such a\r\ndisease a reparative process? Can such an illness be unaccompanied with\r\nsuffering? Will any care prevent such a patient from suffering this or\r\nthat?--I humbly say, I do not know. But when you have done away with all\r\nthat pain and suffering, which in patients are the symptoms not of their\r\ndisease, but of the absence of one or all of the above-mentioned\r\nessentials to the success of Nature's reparative processes, we shall\r\nthen know what are the symptoms of and the sufferings inseparable from\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nAnother and the commonest exclamation which will be instantly made\r\nis--Would you do nothing, then, in cholera, fever, &c.?--so deep-rooted\r\nand universal is the conviction that to give medicine is to be doing\r\nsomething, or rather everything; to give air, warmth, cleanliness, &c.,\r\nis to do nothing. The reply is, that in these and many other similar\r\ndiseases the exact value of particular remedies and modes of treatment\r\nis by no means ascertained, while there is universal experience as to\r\nthe extreme importance of careful nursing in determining the issue of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nursing the well.]\r\n\r\nII. The very elements of what constitutes good nursing are as little\r\nunderstood for the well as for the sick. The same laws of health or of\r\nnursing, for they are in reality the same, obtain among the well as\r\namong the sick. The breaking of them produces only a less violent\r\nconsequence among the former than among the latter,--and this sometimes,\r\nnot always.\r\n\r\nIt is constantly objected,--\"But how can I obtain this medical\r\nknowledge? I am not a doctor. I must leave this to doctors.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Little understood.]\r\n\r\nOh, mothers of families! You who say this, do you know that one in every\r\nseven infants in this civilized land of England perishes before it is\r\none year old? That, in London, two in every five die before they are\r\nfive years old? And, in the other great cities of England, nearly one\r\nout of two?[1] \"The life duration of tender babies\" (as some Saturn,\r\nturned analytical chemist, says) \"is the most delicate test\" of sanitary\r\nconditions. Is all this premature suffering and death necessary? Or did\r\nNature intend mothers to be always accompanied by doctors? Or is it\r\nbetter to learn the piano-forte than to learn the laws which subserve\r\nthe preservation of offspring?\r\n\r\nMacaulay somewhere says, that it is extraordinary that, whereas the laws\r\nof the motions of the heavenly bodies, far removed as they are from us,\r\nare perfectly well understood, the laws of the human mind, which are\r\nunder our observation all day and every day, are no better understood\r\nthan they were two thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nBut how much more extraordinary is it that, whereas what we might call\r\nthe coxcombries of education--e.g., the elements of astronomy--are now\r\ntaught to every school-girl, neither mothers of families of any class,\r\nnor school-mistresses of any class, nor nurses of children, nor nurses\r\nof hospitals, are taught anything about those laws which God has\r\nassigned to the relations of our bodies with the world in which He has\r\nput them. In other words, the laws which make these bodies, into which\r\nHe has put our minds, healthy or unhealthy organs of those minds, are\r\nall but unlearnt. Not but that these laws--the laws of life--are in a\r\ncertain measure understood, but not even mothers think it worth their\r\nwhile to study them--to study how to give their children healthy\r\nexistences. They call it medical or physiological knowledge, fit only\r\nfor doctors.\r\n\r\nAnother objection.\r\n\r\nWe are constantly told,--\"But the circumstances which govern our\r\nchildren's healths are beyond our control. What can we do with winds?\r\nThere is the east wind. Most people can tell before they get up in the\r\nmorning whether the wind is in the east.\"\r\n\r\nTo this one can answer with more certainty than to the former\r\nobjections. Who is it who knows when the wind is in the east? Not the\r\nHighland drover, certainly, exposed to the east wind, but the young lady\r\nwho is worn out with the want of exposure to fresh air, to sunlight, &c.\r\nPut the latter under as good sanitary circumstances as the former, and\r\nshe too will not know when the wind is in the east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. VENTILATION AND WARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First rule of nursing, to keep the air within as pure as the\r\nair without.]\r\n\r\nThe very first canon of nursing, the first and the last thing upon which\r\na nurse's attention must be fixed, the first essential to the patient,\r\nwithout which all the rest you can do for him is as nothing, with which\r\nI had almost said you may leave all the rest alone, is this: TO KEEP THE\r\nAIR HE BREATHES AS PURE AS THE EXTERNAL AIR, WITHOUT CHILLING HIM. Yet\r\nwhat is so little attended to? Even where it is thought of at all, the\r\nmost extraordinary misconceptions reign about it. Even in admitting air\r\ninto the patient's room or ward, few people ever think, where that air\r\ncomes from. It may come from a corridor into which other wards are\r\nventilated, from a hall, always unaired, always full of the fumes of\r\ngas, dinner, of various kinds of mustiness; from an underground kitchen,\r\nsink, washhouse, water-closet, or even, as I myself have had sorrowful\r\nexperience, from open sewers loaded with filth; and with this the\r\npatient's room or ward is aired, as it is called--poisoned, it should\r\nrather be said. Always air from the air without, and that, too, through\r\nthose windows, through which the air comes freshest. From a closed\r\ncourt, especially if the wind do not blow that way, air may come as\r\nstagnant as any from a hall or corridor.\r\n\r\nAgain, a thing I have often seen both in private houses and\r\ninstitutions. A room remains uninhabited; the fire place is carefully\r\nfastened up with a board; the windows are never opened; probably the\r\nshutters are kept always shut; perhaps some kind of stores are kept in\r\nthe room; no breath of fresh air can by possibility enter into that\r\nroom, nor any ray of sun. The air is as stagnant, musty, and corrupt as\r\nit can by possibility be made. It is quite ripe to breed small-pox,\r\nscarlet fever, diphtheria, or anything else you please.[2]\r\n\r\nYet the nursery, ward, or sick room adjoining will positively be aired\r\n(?) by having the door opened into that room. Or children will be put\r\ninto that room, without previous preparation, to sleep.\r\n\r\nA short time ago a man walked into a back-kitchen in Queen square, and\r\ncut the throat of a poor consumptive creature, sitting by the fire. The\r\nmurderer did not deny the act, but simply said, \"It's all right.\" Of\r\ncourse he was mad.\r\n\r\nBut in our case, the extraordinary thing is that the victim says, \"It's\r\nall right,\" and that we are not mad. Yet, although we \"nose\" the\r\nmurderers, in the musty unaired unsunned room, the scarlet fever which\r\nis behind the door, or the fever and hospital gangrene which are\r\nstalking among the crowded beds of a hospital ward, we say, \"It's all\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Without chill.]\r\n\r\nWith a proper supply of windows, and a proper supply of fuel in open\r\nfire places, fresh air is comparatively easy to secure when your patient\r\nor patients are in bed. Never be afraid of open windows then. People\r\ndon't catch cold in bed. This is a popular fallacy. With proper\r\nbed-clothes and hot bottles, if necessary, you can always keep a patient\r\nwarm in bed, and well ventilate him at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut a careless nurse, be her rank and education what it may, will stop\r\nup every cranny and keep a hot-house heat when her patient is in\r\nbed,--and, if he is able to get up, leave him comparatively unprotected.\r\nThe time when people take cold (and there are many ways of taking cold,\r\nbesides a cold in the nose,) is when they first get up after the\r\ntwo-fold exhaustion of dressing and of having had the skin relaxed by\r\nmany hours, perhaps days, in bed, and thereby rendered more incapable of\r\nre-action. Then the same temperature which refreshes the patient in bed\r\nmay destroy the patient just risen. And common sense will point out\r\nthat, while purity of air is essential, a temperature must be secured\r\nwhich shall not chill the patient. Otherwise the best that can be\r\nexpected will be a feverish re-action.\r\n\r\nTo have the air within as pure as the air without, it is not necessary,\r\nas often appears to be thought, to make it as cold.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon again, without care, the patient whose vital powers\r\nhave then risen often finds the room as close and oppressive as he found\r\nit cold in the morning. Yet the nurse will be terrified, if a window is\r\nopened[3].\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Open windows.]\r\n\r\nI know an intelligent humane house surgeon who makes a practice of\r\nkeeping the ward windows open. The physicians and surgeons invariably\r\nclose them while going their rounds; and the house surgeon very properly\r\nas invariably opens them whenever the doctors have turned their backs.\r\n\r\nIn a little book on nursing, published a short time ago, we are told,\r\nthat \"with proper care it is very seldom that the windows cannot be\r\nopened for a few minutes twice in the day to admit fresh air from\r\nwithout.\" I should think not; nor twice in the hour either. It only\r\nshows how little the subject has been considered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What kind of warmth desirable.]\r\n\r\nOf all methods of keeping patients warm the very worst certainly is to\r\ndepend for heat on the breath and bodies of the sick. I have known a\r\nmedical officer keep his ward windows hermetically closed, thus exposing\r\nthe sick to all the dangers of an infected atmosphere, because he was\r\nafraid that, by admitting fresh air, the temperature of the ward would\r\nbe too much lowered. This is a destructive fallacy.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to keep a ward warm at the expense of making the sick\r\nrepeatedly breathe their own hot, humid, putrescing atmosphere is a\r\ncertain way to delay recovery or to destroy life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bedrooms almost universally foul.]\r\n\r\nDo you ever go into the bed-rooms of any persons of any class, whether\r\nthey contain one, two, or twenty people, whether they hold sick or well,\r\nat night, or before the windows are opened in the morning, and ever find\r\nthe air anything but unwholesomely close and foul? And why should it be\r\nso? And of how much importance it is that it should not be so? During\r\nsleep, the human body, even when in health, is far more injured by the\r\ninfluence of foul air than when awake. Why can't you keep the air all\r\nnight, then, as pure as the air without in the rooms you sleep in? But\r\nfor this, you must have sufficient outlet for the impure air you make\r\nyourselves to go out; sufficient inlet for the pure air from without to\r\ncome in. You must have open chimneys, open windows, or ventilators; no\r\nclose curtains round your beds; no shutters or curtains to your windows,\r\nnone of the contrivances by which you undermine your own health or\r\ndestroy the chances of recovery of your sick.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When warmth must be most carefully looked to.]\r\n\r\nA careful nurse will keep a constant watch over her sick, especially\r\nweak, protracted, and collapsed cases, to guard against the effects of\r\nthe loss of vital heat by the patient himself. In certain diseased\r\nstates much less heat is produced than in health; and there is a\r\nconstant tendency to the decline and ultimate extinction of the vital\r\npowers by the call made upon them to sustain the heat of the body. Cases\r\nwhere this occurs should be watched with the greatest care from hour to\r\nhour, I had almost said from minute to minute. The feet and legs should\r\nbe examined by the hand from time to time, and whenever a tendency to\r\nchilling is discovered, hot bottles, hot bricks, or warm flannels, with\r\nsome warm drink, should be made use of until the temperature is\r\nrestored. The fire should be, if necessary, replenished. Patients are\r\nfrequently lost in the latter stages of disease from want of attention\r\nto such simple precautions. The nurse may be trusting to the patient's\r\ndiet, or to his medicine, or to the occasional dose of stimulant which\r\nshe is directed to give him, while the patient is all the while sinking\r\nfrom want of a little external warmth. Such cases happen at all times,\r\neven during the height of summer. This fatal chill is most apt to occur\r\ntowards early morning at the period of the lowest temperature of the\r\ntwenty-four hours, and at the time when the effect of the preceding\r\nday's diets is exhausted.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, you may expect that weak patients will suffer cold\r\nmuch more in the morning than in the evening. The vital powers are much\r\nlower. If they are feverish at night, with burning hands and feet, they\r\nare almost sure to be chilly and shivering in the morning. But nurses\r\nare very fond of heating the foot-warmer at night, and of neglecting it\r\nin the morning, when they are busy. I should reverse the matter.\r\n\r\nAll these things require common sense and care. Yet perhaps in no one\r\nsingle thing is so little common sense shewn, in all ranks, as in\r\nnursing.[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cold air not ventilation, nor fresh air a method of chill.]\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary confusion between cold and ventilation, in the minds\r\nof even well educated people, illustrates this. To make a room cold is\r\nby no means necessarily to ventilate it. Nor is it at all necessary, in\r\norder to ventilate a room, to chill it. Yet, if a nurse finds a room\r\nclose, she will let out the fire, thereby making it closer, or she will\r\nopen the door into a cold room, without a fire, or an open window in it,\r\nby way of improving the ventilation. The safest atmosphere of all for a\r\npatient is a good fire and an open window, excepting in extremes of\r\ntemperature. (Yet no nurse can ever be made to understand this.) To\r\nventilate a small room without draughts of course requires more care\r\nthan to ventilate a large one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Night air.]\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary fallacy is the dread of night air. What air can we\r\nbreathe at night but night air? The choice is between pure night air\r\nfrom without and foul night air from within. Most people prefer the\r\nlatter. An unaccountable choice. What will they say if it is proved to\r\nbe true that fully one-half of all the disease we suffer from is\r\noccasioned by people sleeping with their windows shut? An open window\r\nmost nights in the year can never hurt any one. This is not to say that\r\nlight is not necessary for recovery. In great cities, night air is often\r\nthe best and purest air to be had in the twenty-four hours. I could\r\nbetter understand in towns shutting the windows during the day than\r\nduring the night, for the sake of the sick. The absence of smoke, the\r\nquiet, all tend to making night the best time for airing the patients.\r\nOne of our highest medical authorities on Consumption and Climate has\r\ntold me that the air in London is never so good as after ten o'clock at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Air from the outside. Open your windows, shut your doors.]\r\n\r\nAlways air your room, then, from the outside air, if possible. Windows\r\nare made to open; doors are made to shut--a truth which seems extremely\r\ndifficult of apprehension. I have seen a careful nurse airing her\r\npatient's room through the door, near to which were two gaslights, (each\r\nof which consumes as much air as eleven men), a kitchen, a corridor, the\r\ncomposition of the atmosphere in which consisted of gas, paint, foul\r\nair, never changed, full of effluvia, including a current of sewer air\r\nfrom an ill-placed sink, ascending in a continual stream by a\r\nwell-staircase, and discharging themselves constantly into the patient's\r\nroom. The window of the said room, if opened, was all that was desirable\r\nto air it. Every room must be aired from without--every passage from\r\nwithout. But the fewer passages there are in a hospital the better.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Smoke.]\r\n\r\nIf we are to preserve the air within as pure as the air without, it is\r\nneedless to say that the chimney must not smoke. Almost all smoky\r\nchimneys can be cured--from the bottom, not from the top. Often it is\r\nonly necessary to have an inlet for air to supply the fire, which is\r\nfeeding itself, for want of this, from its own chimney. On the other\r\nhand, almost all chimneys can be made to smoke by a careless nurse, who\r\nlets the fire get low and then overwhelms it with coal; not, as we\r\nverily believe, in order to spare herself trouble, (for very rare is\r\nunkindness to the sick), but from not thinking what she is about.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Airing damp things in a patient's room.]\r\n\r\nIn laying down the principle that the first object of the nurse must be\r\nto keep the air breathed by her patient as pure as the air without, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that everything in the room which can give off\r\neffluvia, besides the patient, evaporates itself into his air. And it\r\nfollows that there ought to be nothing in the room, excepting him, which\r\ncan give off effluvia or moisture. Out of all damp towels, &c., which\r\nbecome dry in the room, the damp, of course, goes into the patient's\r\nair. Yet this \"of course\" seems as little thought of, as if it were an\r\nobsolete fiction. How very seldom you see a nurse who acknowledges by\r\nher practice that nothing at all ought to be aired in the patient's\r\nroom, that nothing at all ought to be cooked at the patient's fire!\r\nIndeed the arrangements often make this rule impossible to observe.\r\n\r\nIf the nurse be a very careful one, she will, when the patient leaves\r\nhis bed, but not his room, open the sheets wide, and throw the bed\r\nclothes back, in order to air his bed. And she will spread the wet\r\ntowels or flannels carefully out upon a horse, in order to dry them. Now\r\neither these bed-clothes and towels are not dried and aired, or they dry\r\nand air themselves into the patient's air. And whether the damp and\r\neffluvia do him most harm in his air or in his bed, I leave to you to\r\ndetermine, for I cannot.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effluvia from excreta.]\r\n\r\nEven in health people cannot repeatedly breathe air in which they live\r\nwith impunity, on account of its becoming charged with unwholesome\r\nmatter from the lungs and skin. In disease where everything given off\r\nfrom the body is highly noxious and dangerous, not only must there be\r\nplenty of ventilation to carry off the effluvia, but everything which\r\nthe patient passes must be instantly removed away, as being more noxious\r\nthan even the emanations from the sick.\r\n\r\nOf the fatal effects of the effluvia from the excreta it would seem\r\nunnecessary to speak, were they not so constantly neglected. Concealing\r\nthe utensils behind the vallance to the bed seems all the precaution\r\nwhich is thought necessary for safety in private nursing. Did you but\r\nthink for one moment of the atmosphere under that bed, the saturation of\r\nthe under side of the mattress with the warm evaporations, you would be\r\nstartled and frightened too!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chamber utensils without lids.]\r\n\r\nThe use of any chamber utensil _without a lid_[6] should be utterly\r\nabolished, whether among sick or well. You can easily convince yourself\r\nof the necessity of this absolute rule, by taking one with a lid, and\r\nexamining the under side of that lid. It will be found always covered,\r\nwhenever the utensil is not empty, by condensed offensive moisture.\r\nWhere does that go, when there is no lid?\r\n\r\nEarthenware, or if there is any wood, highly polished and varnished\r\nwood, are the only materials fit for patients' utensils. The very lid of\r\nthe old abominable close-stool is enough to breed a pestilence. It\r\nbecomes saturated with offensive matter, which scouring is only wanted\r\nto bring out. I prefer an earthenware lid as being always cleaner. But\r\nthere are various good new-fashioned arrangements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abolish slop-pails.]\r\n\r\nA slop-pail should never be brought into a sick room. It should be a\r\nrule invariable, rather more important in the private house than\r\nelsewhere, that the utensil should be carried directly to the\r\nwater-closet, emptied there, rinsed there, and brought back. There\r\nshould always be water and a cock in every water-closet for rinsing. But\r\neven if there is not, you must carry water there to rinse with. I have\r\nactually seen, in the private sick room, the utensils emptied into the\r\nfoot-pan, and put back unrinsed under the bed. I can hardly say which is\r\nmost abominable, whether to do this or to rinse the utensil _in_ the\r\nsick room. In the best hospitals it is now a rule that no slop-pail\r\nshall ever be brought into the wards, but that the utensils shall be\r\ncarried direct to be emptied and rinsed at the proper place. I would it\r\nwere so in the private house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fumigations.]\r\n\r\nLet no one ever depend upon fumigations, \"disinfectants,\" and the like,\r\nfor purifying the air. The offensive thing, not its smell, must be\r\nremoved. A celebrated medical lecturer began one day \"Fumigations,\r\ngentlemen, are of essential importance. They make such an abominable\r\nsmell that they compel you to open the window.\" I wish all the\r\ndisinfecting fluids invented made such an \"abominable smell\" that they\r\nforced you to admit fresh air. That would be a useful invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--HEALTH OF HOUSES.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Health of houses. Five points essential.]\r\n\r\nThere are five essential points in securing the health of houses:--\r\n\r\n1. Pure air.\r\n2. Pure water.\r\n3. Efficient drainage.\r\n4. Cleanliness.\r\n5. Light.\r\n\r\nWithout these, no house can be healthy. And it will be unhealthy just in\r\nproportion as they are deficient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pure air.]\r\n\r\n1. To have pure air, your house must be so constructed as that the outer\r\natmosphere shall find its way with ease to every corner of it. House\r\narchitects hardly ever consider this. The object in building a house is\r\nto obtain the largest interest for the money, not to save doctors' bills\r\nto the tenants. But, if tenants should ever become so wise as to refuse\r\nto occupy unhealthily constructed houses, and if Insurance Companies\r\nshould ever come to understand their interest so thoroughly as to pay a\r\nSanitary Surveyor to look after the houses where their clients live,\r\nspeculative architects would speedily be brought to their senses. As it\r\nis, they build what pays best. And there are always people foolish\r\nenough to take the houses they build. And if in the course of time the\r\nfamilies die off, as is so often the case, nobody ever thinks of blaming\r\nany but Providence[8] for the result. Ill-informed medical men aid in\r\nsustaining the delusion, by laying the blame on \"current contagions.\"\r\nBadly constructed houses do for the healthy what badly constructed\r\nhospitals do for the sick. Once insure that the air in a house is\r\nstagnant, and sickness is certain to follow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pure water.]\r\n\r\n2. Pure water is more generally introduced into houses than it used to\r\nbe, thanks to the exertions of the sanitary reformers. Within the last\r\nfew years, a large part of London was in the daily habit of using water\r\npolluted by the drainage of its sewers and water closets. This has\r\nhappily been remedied. But, in many parts of the country, well water of\r\na very impure kind is used for domestic purposes. And when epidemic\r\ndisease shows itself, persons using such water are almost sure to\r\nsuffer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drainage.]\r\n\r\n3. It would be curious to ascertain by inspection, how many houses in\r\nLondon are really well drained. Many people would say, surely all or\r\nmost of them. But many people have no idea in what good drainage\r\nconsists. They think that a sewer in the street, and a pipe leading to\r\nit from the house is good drainage. All the while the sewer may be\r\nnothing but a laboratory from which epidemic disease and ill health is\r\nbeing distilled into the house. No house with any untrapped drain pipe\r\ncommunicating immediately with a sewer, whether it be from water closet,\r\nsink, or gully-grate, can ever be healthy. An untrapped sink may at any\r\ntime spread fever or pyæmia among the inmates of a palace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sinks.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary oblong sink is an abomination. That great surface of stone,\r\nwhich is always left wet, is always exhaling into the air. I have known\r\nwhole houses and hospitals smell of the sink. I have met just as strong\r\na stream of sewer air coming up the back staircase of a grand London\r\nhouse from the sink, as I have ever met at Scutari; and I have seen the\r\nrooms in that house all ventilated by the open doors, and the passages\r\nall _un_ventilated by the closed windows, in order that as much of the\r\nsewer air as possible might be conducted into and retained in the\r\nbed-rooms. It is wonderful.\r\n\r\nAnother great evil in house construction is carrying drains underneath\r\nthe house. Such drains are never safe. All house drains should begin and\r\nend outside the walls. Many people will readily admit, as a theory, the\r\nimportance of these things. But how few are there who can intelligently\r\ntrace disease in their households to such causes! Is it not a fact, that\r\nwhen scarlet fever, measles, or small-pox appear among the children, the\r\nvery first thought which occurs is, \"where\" the children can have\r\n\"caught\" the disease? And the parents immediately run over in their\r\nminds all the families with whom they may have been. They never think of\r\nlooking at home for the source of the mischief. If a neighbour's child\r\nis seized with small-pox, the first question which occurs is whether it\r\nhad been vaccinated. No one would undervalue vaccination; but it becomes\r\nof doubtful benefit to society when it leads people to look abroad for\r\nthe source of evils which exist at home.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleanliness.]\r\n\r\n4. Without cleanliness, within and without your house, ventilation is\r\ncomparatively useless. In certain foul districts of London, poor people\r\nused to object to open their windows and doors because of the foul\r\nsmells that came in. Rich people like to have their stables and dunghill\r\nnear their houses. But does it ever occur to them that with many\r\narrangements of this kind it would be safer to keep the windows shut\r\nthan open? You cannot have the air of the house pure with dung heaps\r\nunder the windows. These are common all over London. And yet people are\r\nsurprised that their children, brought up in large \"well-aired\"\r\nnurseries and bed-rooms suffer from children's epidemics. If they\r\nstudied Nature's laws in the matter of children's health, they would not\r\nbe so surprised.\r\n\r\nThere are other ways of having filth inside a house besides having dirt\r\nin heaps. Old papered walls of years' standing, dirty carpets,\r\nuncleansed furniture, are just as ready sources of impurity to the air\r\nas if there were a dung-heap in the basement. People are so unaccustomed\r\nfrom education and habits to consider how to make a home healthy, that\r\nthey either never think of it at all, and take every disease as a matter\r\nof course, to be \"resigned to\" when it comes \"as from the hand of\r\nProvidence;\" or if they ever entertain the idea of preserving the health\r\nof their household as a duty, they are very apt to commit all kinds of\r\n\"negligences and ignorances\" in performing it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Light.]\r\n\r\n5. A dark house is always an unhealthy house, always an ill-aired house,\r\nalways a dirty house. Want of light stops growth, and promotes scrofula,\r\nrickets, &c., among the children.\r\n\r\nPeople lose their health in a dark house, and if they get ill they\r\ncannot get well again in it. More will be said about this farther on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Three common errors in managing the health of houses.]\r\n\r\nThree out of many \"negligences and ignorances\" in managing the health of\r\nhouses generally, I will here mention as specimens--1. That the female\r\nhead in charge of any building does not think it necessary to visit\r\nevery hole and corner of it every day. How can she expect those who are\r\nunder her to be more careful to maintain her house in a healthy\r\ncondition than she who is in charge of it?--2. That it is not considered\r\nessential to air, to sun, and to clean rooms while uninhabited; which is\r\nsimply ignoring the first elementary notion of sanitary things, and\r\nlaying the ground ready for all kinds of diseases.--3. That the window,\r\nand one window, is considered enough to air a room. Have you never\r\nobserved that any room without a fire-place is always close? And, if you\r\nhave a fire-place, would you cram it up not only with a chimney-board,\r\nbut perhaps with a great wisp of brown paper, in the throat of the\r\nchimney--to prevent the soot from coming down, you say? If your chimney\r\nis foul, sweep it; but don't expect that you can ever air a room with\r\nonly one aperture; don't suppose that to shut up a room is the way to\r\nkeep it clean. It is the best way to foul the room and all that is in\r\nit. Don't imagine that if you, who are in charge, don't look to all\r\nthese things yourself, those under you will be more careful than you\r\nare. It appears as if the part of a mistress now is to complain of her\r\nservants, and to accept their excuses--not to show them how there need\r\nbe neither complaints made nor excuses.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Head in charge must see to House Hygiene, not do it herself.]\r\n\r\nBut again, to look to all these things yourself does not mean to do them\r\nyourself. \"I always open the windows,\" the head in charge often says. If\r\nyou do it, it is by so much the better, certainly, than if it were not\r\ndone at all. But can you not insure that it is done when not done by\r\nyourself? Can you insure that it is not undone when your back is turned?\r\nThis is what being \"in charge\" means. And a very important meaning it\r\nis, too. The former only implies that just what you can do with your own\r\nhands is done. The latter that what ought to be done is always done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Does God think of these things so seriously?]\r\n\r\nAnd now, you think these things trifles, or at least exaggerated. But\r\nwhat you \"think\" or what I \"think\" matters little. Let us see what God\r\nthinks of them. God always justifies His ways. While we are thinking, He\r\nhas been teaching. I have known cases of hospital pyæmia quite as severe\r\nin handsome private houses as in any of the worst hospitals, and from\r\nthe same cause, viz., foul air. Yet nobody learnt the lesson. Nobody\r\nlearnt _anything_ at all from it. They went on _thinking_--thinking that\r\nthe sufferer had scratched his thumb, or that it was singular that \"all\r\nthe servants\" had \"whitlows,\" or that something was \"much about this\r\nyear; there is always sickness in our house.\" This is a favourite mode\r\nof thought--leading _not_ to inquire what is the uniform cause of these\r\ngeneral \"whitlows,\" but to stifle all inquiry. In what sense is\r\n\"sickness\" being \"always there,\" a justification of its being \"there\" at\r\nall?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How does He carry out His laws?]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How does He teach His laws?]\r\n\r\nI will tell you what was the cause of this hospital pyæmia being in that\r\nlarge private house. It was that the sewer air from an ill-placed sink\r\nwas carefully conducted into all the rooms by sedulously opening all the\r\ndoors, and closing all the passage windows. It was that the slops were\r\nemptied into the foot pans;--it was that the utensils were never\r\nproperly rinsed;--it was that the chamber crockery was rinsed with\r\ndirty water;--it was that the beds were never properly shaken, aired,\r\npicked to pieces, or changed. It was that the carpets and curtains were\r\nalways musty;--it was that the furniture was always dusty; it was that\r\nthe papered walls were saturated with dirt;--it was that the floors were\r\nnever cleaned;--it was that the uninhabited rooms were never sunned, or\r\ncleaned, or aired;--it was that the cupboards were always reservoirs of\r\nfoul air;--it was that the windows were always tight shut up at\r\nnight;--it was that no window was ever systematically opened, even in\r\nthe day, or that the right window was not opened. A person gasping for\r\nair might open a window for himself. But the servants were not taught to\r\nopen the windows, to shut the doors; or they opened the windows upon a\r\ndank well between high walls, not upon the airier court; or they opened\r\nthe room doors into the unaired halls and passages, by way of airing the\r\nrooms. Now all this is not fancy, but fact. In that handsome house I\r\nhave known in one summer three cases of hospital pyæmia, one of\r\nphlebitis, two of consumptive cough: all the _immediate_ products of\r\nfoul air. When, in temperate climates, a house is more unhealthy in\r\nsummer than in winter, it is a certain sign of something wrong. Yet\r\nnobody learns the lesson. Yes, God always justifies His ways. He is\r\nteaching while you are not learning. This poor body loses his finger,\r\nthat one loses his life. And all from the most easily preventible\r\ncauses.[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical degeneration in families. Its causes.]\r\n\r\nThe houses of the grandmothers and great grandmothers of this\r\ngeneration, at least the country houses, with front door and back door\r\nalways standing open, winter and summer, and a thorough draught always\r\nblowing through--with all the scrubbing, and cleaning, and polishing,\r\nand scouring which used to go on, the grandmothers, and still more the\r\ngreat grandmothers, always out of doors and never with a bonnet on\r\nexcept to go to church, these things entirely account for the fact so\r\noften seen of a great grandmother, who was a tower of physical vigour\r\ndescending into a grandmother perhaps a little less vigorous but still\r\nsound as a bell and healthy to the core, into a mother languid and\r\nconfined to her carriage and house, and lastly into a daughter sickly\r\nand confined to her bed. For, remember, even with a general decrease of\r\nmortality you may often find a race thus degenerating and still oftener\r\na family. You may see poor little feeble washed-out rags, children of a\r\nnoble stock, suffering morally and physically, throughout their useless,\r\ndegenerate lives, and yet people who are going to marry and to bring\r\nmore such into the world, will consult nothing but their own convenience\r\nas to where they are to live, or how they are to live.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Don't make your sick-room into a ventilating shaft for the\r\nwhole house.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the health of houses where there is a sick person, it\r\noften happens that the sick room is made a ventilating shaft for the\r\nrest of the house. For while the house is kept as close, unaired, and\r\ndirty as usual, the window of the sick room is kept a little open\r\nalways, and the door occasionally. Now, there are certain sacrifices\r\nwhich a house with one sick person in it does make to that sick person:\r\nit ties up its knocker; it lays straw before it in the street. Why can't\r\nit keep itself thoroughly clean and unusually well aired, in deference\r\nto the sick person?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Infection.]\r\n\r\nWe must not forget what, in ordinary language, is called\r\n\"Infection;\"[10]--a thing of which people are generally so afraid that\r\nthey frequently follow the very practice in regard to it which they\r\nought to avoid. Nothing used to be considered so infectious or\r\ncontagious as small pox; and people not very long ago used to cover up\r\npatients with heavy bed clothes, while they kept up large fires and shut\r\nthe windows. Small pox, of course, under this _régime_, is very\r\n\"infectious.\" People are somewhat wiser now in their management of this\r\ndisease. They have ventured to cover the patients lightly and to keep\r\nthe windows open; and we hear much less of the \"infection\" of small pox\r\nthan we used to do. But do people in our days act with more wisdom on\r\nthe subject of \"infection\" in fevers--scarlet fever, measles, &c.--than\r\ntheir forefathers did with small pox? Does not the popular idea of\r\n\"infection\" involve that people should take greater care of themselves\r\nthan of the patient? that, for instance, it is safer not to be too much\r\nwith the patient, not to attend too much to his wants? Perhaps the best\r\nillustration of the utter absurdity of this view of duty in attending on\r\n\"infectious\" diseases is afforded by what was very recently the\r\npractice, if it is not so even now, in some of the European\r\nlazarets--in which the plague-patient used to be condemned to the\r\nhorrors of filth, overcrowding, and want of ventilation, while the\r\nmedical attendant was ordered to examine the patient's tongue through an\r\nopera-glass and to toss him a lancet to open his abscesses with!\r\n\r\nTrue nursing ignores infection, except to prevent it. Cleanliness and\r\nfresh air from open windows, with unremitting attention to the patient,\r\nare the only defence a true nurse either asks or needs.\r\n\r\nWise and humane management of the patient is the best safeguard against\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why must children have measles, &c.?]\r\n\r\nThere are not a few popular opinions, in regard to which it is useful at\r\ntimes to ask a question or two. For example, it is commonly thought that\r\nchildren must have what are commonly called \"children's epidemics,\"\r\n\"current contagions,\" &c., in other words, that they are born to have\r\nmeasles, hooping-cough, perhaps even scarlet fever, just as they are\r\nborn to cut their teeth, if they live.\r\n\r\nNow, do tell us, why must a child have measles?\r\n\r\nOh because, you say, we cannot keep it from infection--other children\r\nhave measles--and it must take them--and it is safer that it should.\r\n\r\nBut why must other children have measles? And if they have, why must\r\nyours have them too?\r\n\r\nIf you believed in and observed the laws for preserving the health of\r\nhouses which inculcate cleanliness, ventilation, white-washing, and\r\nother means, and which, by the way, _are laws_, as implicitly as you\r\nbelieve in the popular opinion, for it is nothing more than an opinion,\r\nthat your child must have children's epidemics, don't you think that\r\nupon the whole your child would be more likely to escape altogether?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. PETTY MANAGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petty management.]\r\n\r\nAll the results of good nursing, as detailed in these notes, may be\r\nspoiled or utterly negatived by one defect, viz.: in petty management,\r\nor, in other words, by not knowing how to manage that what you do when\r\nyou are there, shall be done when you are not there. The most devoted\r\nfriend or nurse cannot be always _there_. Nor is it desirable that she\r\nshould. And she may give up her health, all her other duties, and yet,\r\nfor want of a little management, be not one-half so efficient as another\r\nwho is not one-half so devoted, but who has this art of multiplying\r\nherself--that is to say, the patient of the first will not really be so\r\nwell cared for, as the patient of the second.\r\n\r\nIt is as impossible in a book to teach a person in charge of sick how to\r\n_manage_, as it is to teach her how to nurse. Circumstances must vary\r\nwith each different case. But it _is_ possible to press upon her to\r\nthink for herself: Now what does happen during my absence? I am obliged\r\nto be away on Tuesday. But fresh air, or punctuality is not less\r\nimportant to my patient on Tuesday than it was on Monday. Or: At 10\r\nP.M. I am never with my patient; but quiet is of no less\r\nconsequence to him at 10 than it was at 5 minutes to 10.\r\n\r\nCurious as it may seem, this very obvious consideration occurs\r\ncomparatively to few, or, if it does occur, it is only to cause the\r\ndevoted friend or nurse to be absent fewer hours or fewer minutes from\r\nher patient--not to arrange so as that no minute and no hour shall be\r\nfor her patient without the essentials of her nursing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Illustrations of the want of it.]\r\n\r\nA very few instances will be sufficient, not as precepts, but as\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Strangers coming into the sick room.]\r\n\r\nA strange washerwoman, coming late at night for the \"things,\" will burst\r\nin by mistake to the patient's sick-room, after he has fallen into his\r\nfirst doze, giving him a shock, the effects of which are irremediable,\r\nthough he himself laughs at the cause, and probably never even mentions\r\nit. The nurse who is, and is quite right to be, at her supper, has not\r\nprovided that the washerwoman shall not lose her way and go into the\r\nwrong room.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sick room airing the whole house.]\r\n\r\nThe patient's room may always have the window open. But the passage\r\noutside the patient's room, though provided with several large windows,\r\nmay never have one open. Because it is not understood that the charge of\r\nthe sick-room extends to the charge of the passage. And thus, as often\r\nhappens, the nurse makes it her business to turn the patient's room into\r\na ventilating shaft for the foul air of the whole house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uninhabited room fouling the whole house.]\r\n\r\nAn uninhabited room, a newly painted room,[11] an uncleaned closet or\r\ncupboard, may often become a reservoir of foul air for the whole house,\r\nbecause the person in charge never thinks of arranging that these places\r\nshall be always aired, always cleaned; she merely opens the window\r\nherself \"when she goes in.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Delivery and non-delivery of letters and messages.]\r\n\r\nAn agitating letter or message may be delivered, or an important letter\r\nor message _not_ delivered; a visitor whom it was of consequence to see,\r\nmay be refused, or one whom it was of still more consequence _not_ to\r\nsee may be admitted--because the person in charge has never asked\r\nherself this question, What is done when I am not there?[12]\r\n\r\nAt all events, one may safely say, a nurse cannot be with the patient,\r\nopen the door, eat her meals, take a message, all at one and the same\r\ntime. Nevertheless the person in charge never seems to look the\r\nimpossibility in the face.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that the _attempting_ this impossibility does more to\r\nincrease the poor Patient's hurry and nervousness than anything else.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Partial measures such as \"being always in the way\" yourself,\r\nincrease instead of saving the patient's anxiety. Because they must be\r\nonly partial.]\r\n\r\nIt is never thought that the patient remembers these things if you do\r\nnot. He has not only to think whether the visit or letter may arrive,\r\nbut whether you will be in the way at the particular day and hour when\r\nit may arrive. So that your _partial_ measures for \"being in the way\"\r\nyourself, only increase the necessity for his thought. Whereas, if you\r\ncould but arrange that the thing should always be done whether you are\r\nthere or not, he need never think at all about it.\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, whatever a patient _can_ do for himself, it is\r\nbetter, i.e. less anxiety, for him to do for himself, unless the\r\nperson in charge has the spirit of management.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently much less exertion for a patient to answer a letter for\r\nhimself by return of post, than to have four conversations, wait five\r\ndays, have six anxieties before it is off his mind, before the person\r\nwho is to answer it has done so.\r\n\r\nApprehension, uncertainty, waiting, expectation, fear of surprise, do a\r\npatient more harm than any exertion. Remember, he is face to face with\r\nhis enemy all the time, internally wrestling with him, having long\r\nimaginary conversations with him. You are thinking of something else.\r\n\"Rid him of his adversary quickly,\" is a first rule with the sick.[13]\r\n\r\nFor the same reasons, always tell a patient and tell him beforehand when\r\nyou are going out and when you will be back, whether it is for a day, an\r\nhour, or ten minutes. You fancy perhaps that it is better for him if he\r\ndoes not find out your going at all, better for him if you do not make\r\nyourself \"of too much importance\" to him; or else you cannot bear to\r\ngive him the pain or the anxiety of the temporary separation.\r\n\r\nNo such thing. You _ought_ to go, we will suppose. Health or duty\r\nrequires it. Then say so to the patient openly. If you go without his\r\nknowing it, and he finds it out, he never will feel secure again that\r\nthe things which depend upon you will be done when you are away, and in\r\nnine cases out of ten he will be right. If you go out without telling\r\nhim when you will be back, he can take no measures nor precautions as to\r\nthe things which concern you both, or which you do for him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What is the cause of half the accidents which happen?]\r\n\r\nIf you look into the reports of trials or accidents, and especially of\r\nsuicides, or into the medical history of fatal cases, it is almost\r\nincredible how often the whole thing turns upon something which has\r\nhappened because \"he,\" or still oftener \"she,\" \"was not there.\" But it\r\nis still more incredible how often, how almost always this is accepted\r\nas a sufficient reason, a justification; why, the very fact of the thing\r\nhaving happened is the proof of its not being a justification. The\r\nperson in charge was quite right not to be \"_there_,\" he was called away\r\nfor quite sufficient reason, or he was away for a daily recurring and\r\nunavoidable cause: yet no provision was made to supply his absence. The\r\nfault was not in his \"being away,\" but in there being no management to\r\nsupplement his \"being away.\" When the sun is under a total eclipse or\r\nduring his nightly absence, we light candles. But it would seem as if it\r\ndid not occur to us that we must also supplement the person in charge of\r\nsick or of children, whether under an occasional eclipse or during a\r\nregular absence.\r\n\r\nIn institutions where many lives would be lost and the effect of such\r\nwant of management would be terrible and patent, there is less of it\r\nthan in the private house.[14]\r\n\r\nBut in both, let whoever is in charge keep this simple question in her\r\nhead (_not_, how can I always do this right thing myself, but) how can I\r\nprovide for this right thing to be always done?\r\n\r\nThen, when anything wrong has actually happened in consequence of her\r\nabsence, which absence we will suppose to have been quite right, let her\r\nquestion still be (_not_, how can I provide against any more of such\r\nabsences? which is neither possible nor desirable, but) how can I\r\nprovide against any thing wrong arising out of my absence?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What it is to be \"in charge.\"]\r\n\r\nHow few men, or even women, understand, either in great or in little\r\nthings, what it is the being \"in charge\"--I mean, know how to carry out\r\na \"charge.\" From the most colossal calamities, down to the most trifling\r\naccidents, results are often traced (or rather _not_ traced) to such\r\nwant of some one \"in charge\" or of his knowing how to be \"in charge.\" A\r\nshort time ago the bursting of a funnel-casing on board the finest and\r\nstrongest ship that ever was built, on her trial trip, destroyed several\r\nlives and put several hundreds in jeopardy--not from any undetected flaw\r\nin her new and untried works--but from a tap being closed which ought\r\nnot to have been closed--from what every child knows would make its\r\nmother's tea-kettle burst. And this simply because no one seemed to know\r\nwhat it is to be \"in charge,\" or _who_ was in charge. Nay more, the jury\r\nat the inquest actually altogether ignored the same, and apparently\r\nconsidered the tap \"in charge,\" for they gave as a verdict \"accidental\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the meaning of the word, on a large scale. On a much smaller\r\nscale, it happened, a short time ago, that an insane person burnt\r\nherself slowly and intentionally to death, while in her doctor's charge\r\nand almost in her nurse's presence. Yet neither was considered \"at all\r\nto blame.\" The very fact of the accident happening proves its own case.\r\nThere is nothing more to be said. Either they did not know their\r\nbusiness or they did not know how to perform it.\r\n\r\nTo be \"in charge\" is certainly not only to carry out the proper measures\r\nyourself but to see that every one else does so too; to see that no one\r\neither wilfully or ignorantly thwarts or prevents such measures. It is\r\nneither to do everything yourself nor to appoint a number of people to\r\neach duty, but to ensure that each does that duty to which he is\r\nappointed. This is the meaning which must be attached to the word by\r\n(above all) those \"in charge\" of sick, whether of numbers or of\r\nindividuals, (and indeed I think it is with individual sick that it is\r\nleast understood. One sick person is often waited on by four with less\r\nprecision, and is really less cared for than ten who are waited on by\r\none; or at least than 40 who are waited on by 4; and all for want of\r\nthis one person \"in charge.)\"\r\n\r\nIt is often said that there are few good servants now: I say there are\r\nfew good mistresses now. As the jury seems to have thought the tap was\r\nin charge of the ship's safety, so mistresses now seem to think the\r\nhouse is in charge of itself. They neither know how to give orders, nor\r\nhow to teach their servants to obey orders--i.e. to obey\r\nintelligently, which is the real meaning of all discipline.\r\n\r\nAgain, people who are in charge often seem to have a pride in feeling\r\nthat they will be \"missed,\" that no one can understand or carry on their\r\narrangements, their system, books, accounts, &c., but themselves. It\r\nseems to me that the pride is rather in carrying on a system, in keeping\r\nstores, closets, books, accounts, &c., so that any body can understand\r\nand carry them on--so that, in case of absence or illness, one can\r\ndeliver every thing up to others and know that all will go on as usual,\r\nand that one shall never be missed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why hired nurses give so much trouble.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--It is often complained, that professional nurses, brought\r\n    into private families, in case of sickness, make themselves\r\n    intolerable by \"ordering about\" the other servants, under plea of\r\n    not neglecting the patient. Both things are true; the patient is\r\n    often neglected, and the servants are often unfairly \"put upon.\" But\r\n    the fault is generally in the want of management of the head in\r\n    charge. It is surely for her to arrange both that the nurse's place\r\n    is, when necessary, supplemented, and that the patient is never\r\n    neglected--things with a little management quite compatible, and\r\n    indeed only attainable together. It is certainly not for the nurse\r\n    to \"order about\" the servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. NOISE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unnecessary noise.]\r\n\r\nUnnecessary noise, or noise that creates an expectation in the mind, is\r\nthat which hurts a patient. It is rarely the loudness of the noise, the\r\neffect upon the organ of the ear itself, which appears to affect the\r\nsick. How well a patient will generally bear, e.g., the putting up of\r\na scaffolding close to the house, when he cannot bear the talking, still\r\nless the whispering, especially if it be of a familiar voice, outside\r\nhis door.\r\n\r\nThere are certain patients, no doubt, especially where there is slight\r\nconcussion or other disturbance of the brain, who are affected by mere\r\nnoise. But intermittent noise, or sudden and sharp noise, in these as in\r\nall other cases, affects far more than continuous noise--noise with jar\r\nfar more than noise without. Of one thing you may be certain, that\r\nanything which wakes a patient suddenly out of his sleep will invariably\r\nput him into a state of greater excitement, do him more serious, aye,\r\nand lasting mischief, than any continuous noise, however loud.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Never let a patient be waked out of his first sleep.]\r\n\r\nNever to allow a patient to be waked, intentionally or accidentally, is\r\na _sine quâ non_ of all good nursing. If he is roused out of his first\r\nsleep, he is almost certain to have no more sleep. It is a curious but\r\nquite intelligible fact that, if a patient is waked after a few hours'\r\ninstead of a few minutes' sleep, he is much more likely to sleep again.\r\nBecause pain, like irritability of brain, perpetuates and intensifies\r\nitself. If you have gained a respite of either in sleep you have gained\r\nmore than the mere respite. Both the probability of recurrence and of\r\nthe same intensity will be diminished; whereas both will be terribly\r\nincreased by want of sleep. This is the reason why sleep is so\r\nall-important. This is the reason why a patient waked in the early part\r\nof his sleep loses not only his sleep, but his power to sleep. A healthy\r\nperson who allows himself to sleep during the day will lose his sleep at\r\nnight. But it is exactly the reverse with the sick generally; the more\r\nthey sleep, the better will they be able to sleep.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Noise which excites expectation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whispered conversation in the room.]\r\n\r\nI have often been surprised at the thoughtlessness, (resulting in\r\ncruelty, quite unintentionally) of friends or of doctors who will hold a\r\nlong conversation just in the room or passage adjoining to the room of\r\nthe patient, who is either every moment expecting them to come in, or\r\nwho has just seen them, and knows they are talking about him. If he is\r\nan amiable patient, he will try to occupy his attention elsewhere and\r\nnot to listen--and this makes matters worse--for the strain upon his\r\nattention and the effort he makes are so great that it is well if he is\r\nnot worse for hours after. If it is a whispered conversation in the same\r\nroom, then it is absolutely cruel; for it is impossible that the\r\npatient's attention should not be involuntarily strained to hear.\r\nWalking on tip-toe, doing any thing in the room very slowly, are\r\ninjurious, for exactly the same reasons. A firm light quick step, a\r\nsteady quick hand are the desiderata; not the slow, lingering, shuffling\r\nfoot, the timid, uncertain touch. Slowness is not gentleness, though it\r\nis often mistaken for such; quickness, lightness, and gentleness are\r\nquite compatible. Again, if friends and doctors did but watch, as nurses\r\ncan and should watch, the features sharpening, the eyes growing almost\r\nwild, of fever patients who are listening for the entrance from the\r\ncorridor of the persons whose voices they are hearing there, these would\r\nnever run the risk again of creating such expectation, or irritation of\r\nmind.--Such unnecessary noise has undoubtedly induced or aggravated\r\ndelirium in many cases. I have known such--in one case death ensued. It\r\nis but fair to say that this death was attributed to fright. It was the\r\nresult of a long whispered conversation, within sight of the patient,\r\nabout an impending operation; but any one who has known the more than\r\nstoicism, the cheerful coolness, with which the certainty of an\r\noperation will be accepted by any patient, capable of bearing an\r\noperation at all, if it is properly communicated to him, will hesitate\r\nto believe that it was mere fear which produced, as was averred, the\r\nfatal result in this instance. It was rather the uncertainty, the\r\nstrained expectation as to what was to be decided upon.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Or just outside the door.]\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that the other common cause, namely, for a doctor or\r\nfriend to leave the patient and communicate his opinion on the result of\r\nhis visit to the friends just outside the patient's door, or in the\r\nadjoining room, after the visit, but within hearing or knowledge of the\r\npatient is, if possible, worst of all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Noise of female dress.]\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, alarming, peculiarly at this time, when the female\r\nink-bottles are perpetually impressing upon us \"woman's\" \"particular\r\nworth and general missionariness,\" to see that the dress of women is\r\ndaily more and more unfitting them for any \"mission,\" or usefulness at\r\nall. It is equally unfitted for all poetic and all domestic purposes. A\r\nman is now a more handy and far less objectionable being in a sick-room\r\nthan a woman. Compelled by her dress, every woman now either shuffles or\r\nwaddles--only a man can cross the floor of a sick-room without shaking\r\nit! What is become of woman's light step?--the firm, light, quick step\r\nwe have been asking for?\r\n\r\nUnnecessary noise, then, is the most cruel absence of care which can be\r\ninflicted either on sick or well. For, in all these remarks, the sick\r\nare only mentioned as suffering in a greater proportion than the well\r\nfrom precisely the same causes.\r\n\r\nUnnecessary (although slight) noise injures a sick person much more than\r\nnecessary noise (of a much greater amount).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patient's repulsion to nurses who rustle.]\r\n\r\nAll doctrines about mysterious affinities and aversions will be found to\r\nresolve themselves very much, if not entirely, into presence or absence\r\nof care in these things.\r\n\r\nA nurse who rustles (I am speaking of nurses professional and\r\nunprofessional) is the horror of a patient, though perhaps he does not\r\nknow why.\r\n\r\nThe fidget of silk and of crinoline, the rattling of keys, the creaking\r\nof stays and of shoes, will do a patient more harm than all the\r\nmedicines in the world will do him good.\r\n\r\nThe noiseless step of woman, the noiseless drapery of woman, are mere\r\nfigures of speech in this day. Her skirts (and well if they do not throw\r\ndown some piece of furniture) will at least brush against every article\r\nin the room as she moves.[15]\r\n\r\nAgain, one nurse cannot open the door without making everything rattle.\r\nOr she opens the door unnecessarily often, for want of remembering all\r\nthe articles that might be brought in at once.\r\n\r\nA good nurse will always make sure that no door or window in her\r\npatient's room shall rattle or creak; that no blind or curtain shall, by\r\nany change of wind through the open window, be made to flap--especially\r\nwill she be careful of all this before she leaves her patients for the\r\nnight. If you wait till your patients tell you, or remind you of these\r\nthings, where is the use of their having a nurse? There are more shy\r\nthan exacting patients, in all classes; and many a patient passes a bad\r\nnight, time after time, rather than remind his nurse every night of all\r\nthe things she has forgotten.\r\n\r\nIf there are blinds to your windows, always take care to have them well\r\nup, when they are not being used. A little piece slipping down, and\r\nflapping with every draught, will distract a patient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hurry peculiarly hurtful to sick.]\r\n\r\nAll hurry or bustle is peculiarly painful to the sick. And when a\r\npatient has compulsory occupations to engage him, instead of having\r\nsimply to amuse himself, it becomes doubly injurious. The friend who\r\nremains standing and fidgetting about while a patient is talking\r\nbusiness to him, or the friend who sits and proses, the one from an idea\r\nof not letting the patient talk, the other from an idea of amusing\r\nhim,--each is equally inconsiderate. Always sit down when a sick person\r\nis talking business to you, show no signs of hurry, give complete\r\nattention and full consideration if your advice is wanted, and go away\r\nthe moment the subject is ended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to visit the sick and not hurt them.]\r\n\r\nAlways sit within the patient's view, so that when you speak to him he\r\nhas not painfully to turn his head round in order to look at you.\r\nEverybody involuntarily looks at the person speaking. If you make this\r\nact a wearisome one on the part of the patient you are doing him harm.\r\nSo also if by continuing to stand you make him continuously raise his\r\neyes to see you. Be as motionless as possible, and never gesticulate in\r\nspeaking to the sick.\r\n\r\nNever make a patient repeat a message or request, especially if it be\r\nsome time after. Occupied patients are often accused of doing too much\r\nof their own business. They are instinctively right. How often you hear\r\nthe person, charged with the request of giving the message or writing\r\nthe letter, say half an hour afterwards to the patient, \"Did you appoint\r\n12 o'clock?\" or, \"What did you say was the address?\" or ask perhaps some\r\nmuch more agitating question--thus causing the patient the effort of\r\nmemory, or worse still, of decision, all over again. It is really less\r\nexertion to him to write his letters himself. This is the almost\r\nuniversal experience of occupied invalids.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to another caution. Never speak to an invalid from\r\nbehind, nor from the door, nor from any distance from him, nor when he\r\nis doing anything.\r\n\r\nThe official politeness of servants in these things is so grateful to\r\ninvalids, that many prefer, without knowing why, having none but\r\nservants about them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: These things not fancy.]\r\n\r\nThese things are not fancy. If we consider that, with sick as with well,\r\nevery thought decomposes some nervous matter,--that decomposition as\r\nwell as re-composition of nervous matter is always going on, and more\r\nquickly with the sick than with the well,--that, to obtrude abruptly\r\nanother thought upon the brain while it is in the act of destroying\r\nnervous matter by thinking, is calling upon it to make a new\r\nexertion,--if we consider these things, which are facts, not fancies, we\r\nshall remember that we are doing positive injury by interrupting, by\r\n\"startling a fanciful\" person, as it is called. Alas! it is no fancy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interruption damaging to sick.]\r\n\r\nIf the invalid is forced, by his avocations, to continue occupations\r\nrequiring much thinking, the injury is doubly great. In feeding a\r\npatient suffering under delirium or stupor you may suffocate him, by\r\ngiving him his food suddenly, but if you rub his lips gently with a\r\nspoon and thus attract his attention, he will swallow the food\r\nunconsciously, but with perfect safety. Thus it is with the brain. If\r\nyou offer it a thought, especially one requiring a decision, abruptly,\r\nyou do it a real not fanciful injury. Never speak to a sick person\r\nsuddenly; but, at the same time, do not keep his expectation on the\r\ntiptoe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: And to well.]\r\n\r\nThis rule, indeed, applies to the well quite as much as to the sick. I\r\nhave never known persons who exposed themselves for years to constant\r\ninterruption who did not muddle away their intellects by it at last. The\r\nprocess with them may be accomplished without pain. With the sick, pain\r\ngives warning of the injury.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keeping a patient standing.]\r\n\r\nDo not meet or overtake a patient who is moving about in order to speak\r\nto him, or to give him any message or letter. You might just as well\r\ngive him a box on the ear. I have seen a patient fall flat on the ground\r\nwho was standing when his nurse came into the room. This was an accident\r\nwhich might have happened to the most careful nurse. But the other is\r\ndone with intention. A patient in such a state is not going to the East\r\nIndies. If you would wait ten seconds, or walk ten yards further, any\r\npromenade he could make would be over. You do not know the effort it is\r\nto a patient to remain standing for even a quarter of a minute to listen\r\nto you. If I had not seen the thing done by the kindest nurses and\r\nfriends, I should have thought this caution quite superfluous.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patients dread surprise.]\r\n\r\nPatients are often accused of being able to \"do much more when nobody is\r\nby.\" It is quite true that they can. Unless nurses can be brought to\r\nattend to considerations of the kind of which we have given here but a\r\nfew specimens, a very weak patient finds it really much less exertion to\r\ndo things for himself than to ask for them. And he will, in order to do\r\nthem, (very innocently and from instinct) calculate the time his nurse\r\nis likely to be absent, from a fear of her \"coming in upon\" him or\r\nspeaking to him, just at the moment when he finds it quite as much as he\r\ncan do to crawl from his bed to his chair, or from one room to another,\r\nor down stairs, or out of doors for a few minutes. Some extra call made\r\nupon his attention at that moment will quite upset him. In these cases\r\nyou may be sure that a patient in the state we have described does not\r\nmake such exertions more than once or twice a-day, and probably much\r\nabout the same hour every day. And it is hard, indeed, if nurse and\r\nfriends cannot calculate so as to let him make them undisturbed.\r\nRemember, that many patients can walk who cannot stand or even sit up.\r\nStanding is, of all positions, the most trying to a weak patient.\r\n\r\nEverything you do in a patient's room, after he is \"put up\" for the\r\nnight, increases tenfold the risk of his having a bad night. But, if you\r\nrouse him up after he has fallen asleep, you do not risk, you secure him\r\na bad night.\r\n\r\nOne hint I would give to all who attend or visit the sick, to all who\r\nhave to pronounce an opinion upon sickness or its progress. Come back\r\nand look at your patient _after_ he has had an hour's animated\r\nconversation with you. It is the best test of his real state we know.\r\nBut never pronounce upon him from merely seeing what he does, or how he\r\nlooks, during such a conversation. Learn also carefully and exactly, if\r\nyou can, how he passed the night after it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of over-exertion on sick.]\r\n\r\nPeople rarely, if ever, faint while making an exertion. It is after it\r\nis over. Indeed, almost every effect of over-exertion appears after, not\r\nduring such exertion. It is the highest folly to judge of the sick, as\r\nis so often done, when you see them merely during a period of\r\nexcitement. People have very often died of that which, it has been\r\nproclaimed at the time, has \"done them no harm.\"[17]\r\n\r\nRemember never to lean against, sit upon, or unnecessarily shake, or\r\neven touch the bed in which a patient lies. This is invariably a painful\r\nannoyance. If you shake the chair on which he sits, he has a point by\r\nwhich to steady himself, in his feet. But on a bed or sofa, he is\r\nentirely at your mercy, and he feels every jar you give him all through\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference between real and fancy patients.]\r\n\r\nIn all that we have said, both here and elsewhere, let it be distinctly\r\nunderstood that we are not speaking of hypochondriacs. To distinguish\r\nbetween real and fancied disease forms an important branch of the\r\neducation of a nurse. To manage fancy patients forms an important branch\r\nof her duties. But the nursing which real and that which fancied\r\npatients require is of different, or rather of opposite, character. And\r\nthe latter will not be spoken of here. Indeed, many of the symptoms\r\nwhich are here mentioned are those which distinguish real from fancied\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIt is true that hypochondriacs very often do that behind a nurse's back\r\nwhich they would not do before her face. Many such I have had as\r\npatients who scarcely ate anything at their regular meals; but if you\r\nconcealed food for them in a drawer, they would take it at night or in\r\nsecret. But this is from quite a different motive. They do it from the\r\nwish to conceal. Whereas the real patient will often boast to his nurse\r\nor doctor, if these do not shake their heads at him, of how much he has\r\ndone, or eaten, or walked. To return to real disease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conciseness necessary with Sick.]\r\n\r\nConciseness and decision are, above all things, necessary with the sick.\r\nLet your thought expressed to them be concisely and decidedly expressed.\r\nWhat doubt and hesitation there may be in your own mind must never be\r\ncommunicated to theirs, not even (I would rather say especially not) in\r\nlittle things. Let your doubt be to yourself, your decision to them.\r\nPeople who think outside their heads, the whole process of whose thought\r\nappears, like Homer's, in the act of secretion, who tell everything that\r\nled them towards this conclusion and away from that, ought never to be\r\nwith the sick.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irresolution most painful to them.]\r\n\r\nIrresolution is what all patients most dread. Rather than meet this in\r\nothers, they will collect all their data, and make up their minds for\r\nthemselves. A change of mind in others, whether it is regarding an\r\noperation, or re-writing a letter, always injures the patient more than\r\nthe being called upon to make up his mind to the most dreaded or\r\ndifficult decision. Farther than this, in very many cases, the\r\nimagination in disease is far more active and vivid than it is in\r\nhealth. If you propose to the patient change of air to one place one\r\nhour, and to another the next, he has, in each case, immediately\r\nconstituted himself in imagination the tenant of the place, gone over\r\nthe whole premises in idea, and you have tired him as much by displacing\r\nhis imagination, as if you had actually carried him over both places.\r\n\r\nAbove all leave the sick room quickly and come into it quickly, not\r\nsuddenly, not with a rush. But don't let the patient be wearily waiting\r\nfor when you will be out of the room or when you will be in it.\r\nConciseness and decision in your movements, as well as your words, are\r\nnecessary in the sick room, as necessary as absence of hurry and bustle.\r\nTo possess yourself entirely will ensure you from either failing--either\r\nloitering or hurrying.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What a patient must not have to see to.]\r\n\r\nIf a patient has to see, not only to his own but also to his nurse's\r\npunctuality, or perseverance, or readiness, or calmness, to any or all\r\nof these things, he is far better without that nurse than with\r\nher--however valuable and handy her services may otherwise be to him,\r\nand however incapable he may be of rendering them to himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reading aloud.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to reading aloud in the sick room, my experience is, that\r\nwhen the sick are too ill to read to themselves, they can seldom bear to\r\nbe read to. Children, eye-patients, and uneducated persons are\r\nexceptions, or where there is any mechanical difficulty in reading.\r\nPeople who like to be read to, have generally not much the matter with\r\nthem; while in fevers, or where there is much irritability of brain, the\r\neffort of listening to reading aloud has often brought on delirium. I\r\nspeak with great diffidence; because there is an almost universal\r\nimpression that it is _sparing_ the sick to read aloud to them. But two\r\nthings are certain:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Read aloud slowly, distinctly, and steadily to the sick.]\r\n\r\n(1.) If there is some matter which _must_ be read to a sick person, do\r\nit slowly. People often think that the way to get it over with least\r\nfatigue to him is to get it over in least time. They gabble; they plunge\r\nand gallop through the reading. There never was a greater mistake.\r\nHoudin, the conjuror, says that the way to make a story seem short is to\r\ntell it slowly. So it is with reading to the sick. I have often heard a\r\npatient say to such a mistaken reader, \"Don't read it to me; tell it\r\nme.\"[18] Unconsciously he is aware that this will regulate the plunging,\r\nthe reading with unequal paces, slurring over one part, instead of\r\nleaving it out altogether, if it is unimportant, and mumbling another.\r\nIf the reader lets his own attention wander, and then stops to read up\r\nto himself, or finds he has read the wrong bit, then it is all over with\r\nthe poor patient's chance of not suffering. Very few people know how to\r\nread to the sick; very few read aloud as pleasantly even as they speak.\r\nIn reading they sing, they hesitate, they stammer, they hurry, they\r\nmumble; when in speaking they do none of these things. Reading aloud to\r\nthe sick ought always to be rather slow, and exceedingly distinct, but\r\nnot mouthing--rather monotonous, but not sing song--rather loud, but not\r\nnoisy--and, above all, not too long. Be very sure of what your patient\r\ncan bear.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Never read aloud by fits and starts to the sick.]\r\n\r\n(2.) The extraordinary habit of reading to oneself in a sick room, and\r\nreading aloud to the patient any bits which will amuse him or more often\r\nthe reader, is unaccountably thoughtless. What _do_ you think the\r\npatient is thinking of during your gaps of non-reading? Do you think\r\nthat he amuses himself upon what you have read for precisely the time it\r\npleases you to go on reading to yourself, and that his attention is\r\nready for something else at precisely the time it pleases you to begin\r\nreading again? Whether the person thus read to be sick or well, whether\r\nhe be doing nothing or doing something else while being thus read to,\r\nthe self-absorption and want of observation of the person who does it,\r\nis equally difficult to understand--although very often the read_ee_ is\r\ntoo amiable to say how much it disturbs him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: People overhead.]\r\n\r\nOne thing more:--From the flimsy manner in which most modern houses are\r\nbuilt, where every step on the stairs, and along the floors, is felt all\r\nover the house; the higher the story, the greater the vibration. It is\r\ninconceivable how much the sick suffer by having anybody overhead. In\r\nthe solidly built old houses, which, fortunately, most hospitals are,\r\nthe noise and shaking is comparatively trifling. But it is a serious\r\ncause of suffering, in lightly built houses, and with the irritability\r\npeculiar to some diseases. Better far put such patients at the top of\r\nthe house, even with the additional fatigue of stairs, if you cannot\r\nsecure the room above them being untenanted; you may otherwise bring on\r\na state of restlessness which no opium will subdue. Do not neglect the\r\nwarning, when a patient tells you that he \"Feels every step above him to\r\ncross his heart.\" Remember that every noise a patient cannot _see_\r\npartakes of the character of suddenness to him; and I am persuaded that\r\npatients with these peculiarly irritable nerves, are positively less\r\ninjured by having persons in the same room with them than overhead, or\r\nseparated by only a thin compartment. Any sacrifice to secure silence\r\nfor these cases is worth while, because no air, however good, no\r\nattendance, however careful, will do anything for such cases without\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Music.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The effect of music upon the sick has been scarcely at all\r\n    noticed. In fact, its expensiveness, as it is now, makes any general\r\n    application of it quite out of the question. I will only remark\r\n    here, that wind instruments, including the human voice, and stringed\r\n    instruments, capable of continuous sound, have generally a\r\n    beneficent effect--while the piano-forte, with such instruments as\r\n    have _no_ continuity of sound, has just the reverse. The finest\r\n    piano-forte playing will damage the sick, while an air, like \"Home,\r\n    sweet home,\" or \"Assisa a piè d'un salice,\" on the most ordinary\r\n    grinding organ will sensibly soothe them--and this quite independent\r\n    of association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. VARIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Variety a means of recovery.]\r\n\r\nTo any but an old nurse, or an old patient, the degree would be quite\r\ninconceivable to which the nerves of the sick suffer from seeing the\r\nsame walls, the same ceiling, the same surroundings during a long\r\nconfinement to one or two rooms.\r\n\r\nThe superior cheerfulness of persons suffering severe paroxysms of pain\r\nover that of persons suffering from nervous debility has often been\r\nremarked upon, and attributed to the enjoyment of the former of their\r\nintervals of respite. I incline to think that the majority of cheerful\r\ncases is to be found among those patients who are not confined to one\r\nroom, whatever their suffering, and that the majority of depressed cases\r\nwill be seen among those subjected to a long monotony of objects about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe nervous frame really suffers as much from this as the digestive\r\norgans from long monotony of diet, as e.g. the soldier from his\r\ntwenty-one years' \"boiled beef.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Colour and form means of recovery.]\r\n\r\nThe effect in sickness of beautiful objects, of variety of objects, and\r\nespecially of brilliancy of colour is hardly at all appreciated.\r\n\r\nSuch cravings are usually called the \"fancies\" of patients. And often\r\ndoubtless patients have \"fancies,\" as, e.g. when they desire two\r\ncontradictions. But much more often, their (so called) \"fancies\" are the\r\nmost valuable indications of what is necessary for their recovery. And\r\nit would be well if nurses would watch these (so called) \"fancies\"\r\nclosely.\r\n\r\nI have seen, in fevers (and felt, when I was a fever patient myself) the\r\nmost acute suffering produced from the patient (in a hut) not being able\r\nto see out of window, and the knots in the wood being the only view. I\r\nshall never forget the rapture of fever patients over a bunch of\r\nbright-coloured flowers. I remember (in my own case) a nosegay of wild\r\nflowers being sent me, and from that moment recovery becoming more\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: This is no fancy.]\r\n\r\nPeople say the effect is only on the mind. It is no such thing. The\r\neffect is on the body, too. Little as we know about the way in which we\r\nare affected by form, by colour, and light, we do know this, that they\r\nhave an actual physical effect.\r\n\r\nVariety of form and brilliancy of colour in the objects presented to\r\npatients are actual means of recovery.\r\n\r\nBut it must be _slow_ variety, e.g., if you shew a patient ten or\r\ntwelve engravings successively, ten-to-one that he does not become cold\r\nand faint, or feverish, or even sick; but hang one up opposite him, one\r\non each successive day, or week, or month, and he will revel in the\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flowers.]\r\n\r\nThe folly and ignorance which reign too often supreme over the\r\nsick-room, cannot be better exemplified than by this. While the nurse\r\nwill leave the patient stewing in a corrupting atmosphere, the best\r\ningredient of which is carbonic acid; she will deny him, on the plea of\r\nunhealthiness, a glass of cut-flowers, or a growing plant. Now, no one\r\never saw \"overcrowding\" by plants in a room or ward. And the carbonic\r\nacid they give off at nights would not poison a fly. Nay, in overcrowded\r\nrooms, they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen.\r\nCut-flowers also decompose water and produce oxygen gas. It is true\r\nthere are certain flowers, e.g., lilies, the smell of which is said to\r\ndepress the nervous system. These are easily known by the smell, and can\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of body on mind.]\r\n\r\nVolumes are now written and spoken upon the effect of the mind upon the\r\nbody. Much of it is true. But I wish a little more was thought of the\r\neffect of the body on the mind. You who believe yourselves overwhelmed\r\nwith anxieties, but are able every day to walk up Regent-street, or out\r\nin the country, to take your meals with others in other rooms, &c., &c.,\r\nyou little know how much your anxieties are thereby lightened; you\r\nlittle know how intensified they become to those who can have no\r\nchange;[19] how the very walls of their sick rooms seem hung with their\r\ncares; how the ghosts of their troubles haunt their beds; how impossible\r\nit is for them to escape from a pursuing thought without some help from\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nA patient can just as much move his leg when it is fractured as change\r\nhis thoughts when no external help from variety is given him. This is,\r\nindeed, one of the main sufferings of sickness; just as the fixed\r\nposture is one of the main sufferings of the broken limb.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Help the sick to vary their thoughts.]\r\n\r\nIt is an ever recurring wonder to see educated people, who call\r\nthemselves nurses, acting thus. They vary their own objects, their own\r\nemployments many times a day; and while nursing (!) some bed-ridden\r\nsufferer, they let him lie there staring at a dead wall, without any\r\nchange of object to enable him to vary his thoughts; and it never even\r\noccurs to them, at least to move his bed so that he can look out of\r\nwindow. No, the bed is to be always left in the darkest, dullest,\r\nremotest, part of the room.[20]\r\n\r\nI think it is a very common error among the well to think that \"with a\r\nlittle more self-control\" the sick might, if they choose, \"dismiss\r\npainful thoughts\" which \"aggravate their disease,\" &c. Believe me,\r\nalmost _any_ sick person, who behaves decently well, exercises more\r\nself-control every moment of his day than you will ever know till you\r\nare sick yourself. Almost every step that crosses his room is painful to\r\nhim; almost every thought that crosses his brain is painful to him; and\r\nif he can speak without being savage, and look without being unpleasant,\r\nhe is exercising self-control.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have been up all night, and instead of being allowed to have\r\nyour cup of tea, you were to be told that you ought to \"exercise\r\nself-control,\" what should you say? Now, the nerves of the sick are\r\nalways in the state that yours are in after you have been up all night.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Supply to the sick the defect of manual labour.]\r\n\r\nWe will suppose the diet of the sick to be cared for. Then, this state\r\nof nerves is most frequently to be relieved by care in affording them a\r\npleasant view, a judicious variety as to flowers,[21] and pretty things.\r\nLight by itself will often relieve it. The craving for \"the return of\r\nday,\" which the sick so constantly evince, is generally nothing but the\r\ndesire for light, the remembrance of the relief which a variety of\r\nobjects before the eye affords to the harassed sick mind.\r\n\r\nAgain, every man and every woman has some amount of manual employment,\r\nexcepting a few fine ladies, who do not even dress themselves, and who\r\nare virtually in the same category, as to nerves, as the sick. Now, you\r\ncan have no idea of the relief which manual labour is to you--of the\r\ndegree to which the deprivation of manual employment increases the\r\npeculiar irritability from which many sick suffer.\r\n\r\nA little needle-work, a little writing, a little cleaning, would be the\r\ngreatest relief the sick could have, if they could do it; these _are_\r\nthe greatest relief to you, though you do not know it. Reading, though\r\nit is often the only thing the sick can do, is not this relief. Bearing\r\nthis in mind, bearing in mind that you have all these varieties of\r\nemployment which the sick cannot have, bear also in mind to obtain for\r\nthem all the varieties which they can enjoy.\r\n\r\nI need hardly say that I am well aware that excess in needle-work, in\r\nwriting, in any other continuous employment, will produce the same\r\nirritability that defect in manual employment (as one cause) produces in\r\nthe sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. TAKING FOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Want of attention to hours of taking food.]\r\n\r\nEvery careful observer of the sick will agree in this that thousands of\r\npatients are annually starved in the midst of plenty, from want of\r\nattention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take\r\nfood. This want of attention is as remarkable in those who urge upon the\r\nsick to do what is quite impossible to them, as in the sick themselves\r\nwho will not make the effort to do what is perfectly possible to them.\r\n\r\nFor instance, to the large majority of very weak patients it is quite\r\nimpossible to take any solid food before 11 A.M., nor then, if\r\ntheir strength is still further exhausted by fasting till that hour. For\r\nweak patients have generally feverish nights and, in the morning, dry\r\nmouths; and, if they could eat with those dry mouths, it would be the\r\nworse for them. A spoonful of beef-tea, of arrowroot and wine, of egg\r\nflip, every hour, will give them the requisite nourishment, and prevent\r\nthem from being too much exhausted to take at a later hour the solid\r\nfood, which is necessary for their recovery. And every patient who can\r\nswallow at all can swallow these liquid things, if he chooses. But how\r\noften do we hear a mutton-chop, an egg, a bit of bacon, ordered to a\r\npatient for breakfast, to whom (as a moment's consideration would show\r\nus) it must be quite impossible to masticate such things at that hour.\r\n\r\nAgain, a nurse is ordered to give a patient a tea-cup full of some\r\narticle of food every three hours. The patient's stomach rejects it. If\r\nso, try a table-spoon full every hour; if this will not do, a tea-spoon\r\nfull every quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nI am bound to say, that I think more patients are lost by want of care\r\nand ingenuity in these momentous minutiæ in private nursing than in\r\npublic hospitals. And I think there is more of the _entente cordiale_ to\r\nassist one another's hands between the doctor and his head nurse in the\r\nlatter institutions, than between the doctor and the patient's friends\r\nin the private house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Life often hangs upon minutes in taking food.]\r\n\r\nIf we did but know the consequences which may ensue, in very weak\r\npatients, from ten minutes' fasting or repletion, (I call it repletion\r\nwhen they are obliged to let too small an interval elapse between\r\ntaking food and some other exertion, owing to the nurse's\r\nunpunctuality), we should be more careful never to let this occur. In\r\nvery weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty of swallowing,\r\nwhich is so much increased by any other call upon their strength that,\r\nunless they have their food punctually at the minute, which minute again\r\nmust be arranged so as to fall in with no other minute's occupation,\r\nthey can take nothing till the next respite occurs--so that an\r\nunpunctuality or delay of ten minutes may very well turn out to be one\r\nof two or three hours. And why is it not as easy to be punctual to a\r\nminute? Life often literally hangs upon these minutes.\r\n\r\nIn acute cases, where life or death is to be determined in a few hours,\r\nthese matters are very generally attended to, especially in Hospitals;\r\nand the number of cases is large where the patient is, as it were,\r\nbrought back to life by exceeding care on the part of the Doctor or\r\nNurse, or both, in ordering and giving nourishment with minute selection\r\nand punctuality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patients often starved to death in chronic cases.]\r\n\r\nBut, in chronic cases, lasting over months and years, where the fatal\r\nissue is often determined at last by mere protracted starvation, I had\r\nrather not enumerate the instances which I have known where a little\r\ningenuity, and a great deal of perseverance, might, in all probability,\r\nhave averted the result. The consulting the hours when the patient can\r\ntake food, the observation of the times, often varying, when he is most\r\nfaint, the altering seasons of taking food, in order to anticipate and\r\nprevent such times--all this, which requires observation, ingenuity, and\r\nperseverance (and these really constitute the good Nurse), might save\r\nmore lives than we wot of.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Food never to be left by the patient's side.]\r\n\r\nTo leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from meal to meal, in\r\nhopes that he will eat it in the interval, is simply to prevent him from\r\ntaking any food at all. I have known patients literally incapacitated\r\nfrom taking one article of food after another, by this piece of\r\nignorance. Let the food come at the right time, and be taken away, eaten\r\nor uneaten, at the right time; but never let a patient have \"something\r\nalways standing\" by him, if you don't wish to disgust him of everything.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I have known a patient's life saved (he was sinking\r\nfor want of food) by the simple question, put to him by the doctor, \"But\r\nis there no hour when you feel you could eat?\" \"Oh, yes,\" he said, \"I\r\ncould always take something at -- o'clock and -- o'clock.\" The thing was\r\ntried and succeeded. Patients very seldom, however, can tell this; it is\r\nfor you to watch and find it out.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patient had better not see more food than his own.]\r\n\r\nA patient should, if possible, not see or smell either the food of\r\nothers, or a greater amount of food than he himself can consume at one\r\ntime, or even hear food talked about or see it in the raw state. I know\r\nof no exception to the above rule. The breaking of it always induces a\r\ngreater or less incapacity of taking food.\r\n\r\nIn hospital wards it is of course impossible to observe all this; and in\r\nsingle wards, where a patient must be continuously and closely watched,\r\nit is frequently impossible to relieve the attendant, so that his or\r\nher own meals can be taken out of the ward. But it is not the less true\r\nthat, in such cases, even where the patient is not himself aware of it,\r\nhis possibility of taking food is limited by seeing the attendant eating\r\nmeals under his observation. In some cases the sick are aware of it, and\r\ncomplain. A case where the patient was supposed to be insensible, but\r\ncomplained as soon as able to speak, is now present to my recollection.\r\n\r\nRemember, however, that the extreme punctuality in well-ordered\r\nhospitals, the rule that nothing shall be done in the ward while the\r\npatients are having their meals, go far to counterbalance what\r\nunavoidable evil there is in having patients together. I have often seen\r\nthe private nurse go on dusting or fidgeting about in a sick room all\r\nthe while the patient is eating, or trying to eat.\r\n\r\nThat the more alone an invalid can be when taking food, the better, is\r\nunquestionable; and, even if he must be fed, the nurse should not allow\r\nhim to talk, or talk to him, especially about food, while eating.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is compelled, by the pressure of occupation, to continue\r\nhis business while sick, it ought to be a rule WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION\r\nWHATEVER, that no one shall bring business to him or talk to him while\r\nhe is taking food, nor go on talking to him on interesting subjects up\r\nto the last moment before his meals, nor make an engagement with him\r\nimmediately after, so that there be any hurry of mind while taking them.\r\n\r\nUpon the observance of these rules, especially the first, often depends\r\nthe patient's capability of taking food at all, or, if he is amiable and\r\nforces himself to take food, of deriving any nourishment from it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: You cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet.]\r\n\r\nA nurse should never put before a patient milk that is sour, meat or\r\nsoup that is turned, an egg that is bad, or vegetables underdone. Yet\r\noften I have seen these things brought in to the sick in a state\r\nperfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurse's. It is\r\nhere that the clever nurse appears; she will not bring in the peccant\r\narticle, but, not to disappoint the patient, she will whip up something\r\nelse in a few minutes. Remember that sick cookery should half do the\r\nwork of your poor patient's weak digestion. But if you further impair it\r\nwith your bad articles, I know not what is to become of him or of it.\r\n\r\nIf the nurse is an intelligent being, and not a mere carrier of diets to\r\nand from the patient, let her exercise her intelligence in these things.\r\nHow often we have known a patient eat nothing at all in the day, because\r\none meal was left untasted (at that time he was incapable of eating), at\r\nanother the milk was sour, the third was spoiled by some other accident.\r\nAnd it never occurred to the nurse to extemporize some expedient,--it\r\nnever occurred to her that as he had had no solid food that day, he\r\nmight eat a bit of toast (say) with his tea in the evening, or he might\r\nhave some meal an hour earlier. A patient who cannot touch his dinner at\r\ntwo, will often accept it gladly, if brought to him at seven. But\r\nsomehow nurses never \"think of these things.\" One would imagine they did\r\nnot consider themselves bound to exercise their judgment; they leave it\r\nto the patient. Now I am quite sure that it is better for a patient\r\nrather to suffer these neglects than to try to teach his nurse to nurse\r\nhim, if she does not know how. It ruffles him, and if he is ill he is in\r\nno condition to teach, especially upon himself. The above remarks apply\r\nmuch more to private nursing than to hospitals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nurse must have some rule of thought about her patients\r\ndiet.]\r\n\r\nI would say to the nurse, have a rule of thought about your patient's\r\ndiet; consider, remember how much he has had, and how much he ought to\r\nhave to-day. Generally, the only rule of the private patient's diet is\r\nwhat the nurse has to give. It is true she cannot give him what she has\r\nnot got; but his stomach does not wait for her convenience, or even her\r\nnecessity.[22] If it is used to having its stimulus at one hour to-day,\r\nand to-morrow it does not have it, because she has failed in getting it,\r\nhe will suffer. She must be always exercising her ingenuity to supply\r\ndefects, and to remedy accidents which will happen among the best\r\ncontrivers, but from which the patient does not suffer the less, because\r\n\"they cannot be helped.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Keep your patient's cup dry underneath.]\r\n\r\nOne very minute caution,--take care not to spill into your patient's\r\nsaucer, in other words, take care that the outside bottom rim of his cup\r\nshall be quite dry and clean; if, every time he lifts his cup to his\r\nlips, he has to carry the saucer with it, or else to drop the liquid\r\nupon, and to soil his sheet, or his bed-gown, or pillow, or if he is\r\nsitting up, his dress, you have no idea what a difference this minute\r\nwant of care on your part makes to his comfort and even to his\r\nwillingness for food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. WHAT FOOD?\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Common errors in diet.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beef tea.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eggs.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meat without vegetables.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arrowroot.]\r\n\r\nI will mention one or two of the most common errors among women in\r\ncharge of sick respecting sick diet. One is the belief that beef tea is\r\nthe most nutritive of all articles. Now, just try and boil down a lb. of\r\nbeef into beef tea, evaporate your beef tea, and see what is left of\r\nyour beef. You will find that there is barely a teaspoonful of solid\r\nnourishment to half a pint of water in beef tea;--nevertheless there is\r\na certain reparative quality in it, we do not know what, as there is in\r\ntea;--but it may safely be given in almost any inflammatory disease, and\r\nis as little to be depended upon with the healthy or convalescent where\r\nmuch nourishment is required. Again, it is an ever ready saw that an egg\r\nis equivalent to a lb. of meat,--whereas it is not at all so. Also, it\r\nis seldom noticed with how many patients, particularly of nervous or\r\nbilious temperament, eggs disagree. All puddings made with eggs, are\r\ndistasteful to them in consequence. An egg, whipped up with wine, is\r\noften the only form in which they can take this kind of nourishment.\r\nAgain, if the patient has attained to eating meat, it is supposed that\r\nto give him meat is the only thing needful for his recovery; whereas\r\nscorbutic sores have been actually known to appear among sick persons\r\nliving in the midst of plenty in England, which could be traced to no\r\nother source than this, viz.: that the nurse, depending on meat alone,\r\nhad allowed the patient to be without vegetables for a considerable\r\ntime, these latter being so badly cooked that he always left them\r\nuntouched. Arrowroot is another grand dependence of the nurse. As a\r\nvehicle for wine, and as a restorative quickly prepared, it is all very\r\nwell. But it is nothing but starch and water. Flour is both more\r\nnutritive, and less liable to ferment, and is preferable wherever it can\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Milk, butter, cream, &c.]\r\n\r\nAgain, milk and the preparations from milk, are a most important\r\narticle of food for the sick. Butter is the lightest kind of animal fat,\r\nand though it wants the sugar and some of the other elements which there\r\nare in milk, yet it is most valuable both in itself and in enabling the\r\npatient to eat more bread. Flour, oats, groats, barley, and their kind,\r\nare as we have already said, preferable in all their preparations to all\r\nthe preparations of arrow root, sago, tapioca, and their kind. Cream, in\r\nmany long chronic diseases, is quite irreplaceable by any other article\r\nwhatever. It seems to act in the same manner as beef tea, and to most it\r\nis much easier of digestion than milk. In fact, it seldom disagrees.\r\nCheese is not usually digestible by the sick, but it is pure nourishment\r\nfor repairing waste; and I have seen sick, and not a few either, whose\r\ncraving for cheese shewed how much it was needed by them.[23]\r\n\r\nBut, if fresh milk is so valuable a food for the sick, the least change\r\nor sourness in it, makes it of all articles, perhaps, the most\r\ninjurious; diarrhoea is a common result of fresh milk allowed to become\r\nat all sour. The nurse therefore ought to exercise her utmost care in\r\nthis. In large institutions for the sick, even the poorest, the utmost\r\ncare is exercised. Wenham Lake ice is used for this express purpose\r\nevery summer, while the private patient, perhaps, never tastes a drop of\r\nmilk that is not sour, all through the hot weather, so little does the\r\nprivate nurse understand the necessity of such care. Yet, if you\r\nconsider that the only drop of real nourishment in your patient's tea is\r\nthe drop of milk, and how much almost all English patients depend upon\r\ntheir tea, you will see the great importance of not depriving your\r\npatient of this drop of milk. Buttermilk, a totally different thing, is\r\noften very useful, especially in fevers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sweet things.]\r\n\r\nIn laying down rules of diet, by the amounts of \"solid nutriment\" in\r\ndifferent kinds of food, it is constantly lost sight of what the patient\r\nrequires to repair his waste, what he can take and what he can't. You\r\ncannot diet a patient from a book, you cannot make up the human body as\r\nyou would make up a prescription,--so many parts \"carboniferous,\" so\r\nmany parts \"nitrogenous\" will constitute a perfect diet for the patient.\r\nThe nurse's observation here will materially assist the doctor--the\r\npatient's \"fancies\" will materially assist the nurse. For instance,\r\nsugar is one of the most nutritive of all articles, being pure carbon,\r\nand is particularly recommended in some books. But the vast majority of\r\nall patients in England, young and old, male and female, rich and poor,\r\nhospital and private, dislike sweet things,--and while I have never\r\nknown a person take to sweets when he was ill who disliked them when he\r\nwas well, I have known many fond of them when in health, who in sickness\r\nwould leave off anything sweet, even to sugar in tea,--sweet puddings,\r\nsweet drinks, are their aversion; the furred tongue almost always likes\r\nwhat is sharp or pungent. Scorbutic patients are an exception, they\r\noften crave for sweetmeats and jams.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jelly.]\r\n\r\nJelly is another article of diet in great favour with nurses and friends\r\nof the sick; even if it could be eaten solid, it would not nourish, but\r\nit is simply the height of folly to take 1/8 oz. of gelatine and make it\r\ninto a certain bulk by dissolving it in water and then to give it to the\r\nsick, as if the mere bulk represented nourishment. It is now known that\r\njelly does not nourish, that it has a tendency to produce diarrhoea,--and\r\nto trust to it to repair the waste of a diseased constitution is simply\r\nto starve the sick under the guise of feeding them. If 100 spoonfuls of\r\njelly were given in the course of the day, you would have given one\r\nspoonful of gelatine, which spoonful has no nutritive power whatever.\r\n\r\nAnd, nevertheless, gelatine contains a large quantity of nitrogen, which\r\nis one of the most powerful elements in nutrition; on the other hand,\r\nbeef tea may be chosen as an illustration of great nutrient power in\r\nsickness, co-existing with a very small amount of solid nitrogenous\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beef tea.]\r\n\r\nDr. Christison says that \"every one will be struck with the readiness\r\nwith which\" certain classes of \"patients will often take diluted meat\r\njuice or beef tea repeatedly, when they refuse all other kinds of food.\"\r\nThis is particularly remarkable in \"cases of gastric fever, in which,\"\r\nhe says, \"little or nothing else besides beef tea or diluted meat juice\"\r\nhas been taken for weeks or even months, \"and yet a pint of beef tea\r\ncontains scarcely 1/4 oz. of anything but water,\"--the result is so\r\nstriking that he asks what is its mode of action? \"Not simply\r\nnutrient--1/4 oz. of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace\r\nthe daily wear and tear of the tissues in any circumstances. Possibly,\"\r\nhe says, \"it belongs to a new denomination of remedies.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that a small quantity of beef tea added to other\r\narticles of nutrition augments their power out of all proportion to the\r\nadditional amount of solid matter.\r\n\r\nThe reason why jelly should be innutritious and beef tea nutritious to\r\nthe sick, is a secret yet undiscovered, but it clearly shows that\r\ncareful observation of the sick is the only clue to the best dietary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observation, not chemistry, must decide sick diet.]\r\n\r\nChemistry has as yet afforded little insight into the dieting of sick.\r\nAll that chemistry can tell us is the amount of \"carboniferous\" or\r\n\"nitrogenous\" elements discoverable in different dietetic articles. It\r\nhas given us lists of dietetic substances, arranged in the order of\r\ntheir richness in one or other of these principles; but that is all. In\r\nthe great majority of cases, the stomach of the patient is guided by\r\nother principles of selection than merely the amount of carbon or\r\nnitrogen in the diet. No doubt, in this as in other things, nature has\r\nvery definite rules for her guidance, but these rules can only be\r\nascertained by the most careful observation at the bed-side. She there\r\nteaches us that living chemistry, the chemistry of reparation, is\r\nsomething different from the chemistry of the laboratory. Organic\r\nchemistry is useful, as all knowledge is, when we come face to face with\r\nnature; but it by no means follows that we should learn in the\r\nlaboratory any one of the reparative processes going on in disease.\r\n\r\nAgain, the nutritive power of milk and of the preparations from milk, is\r\nvery much undervalued; there is nearly as much nourishment in half a\r\npint of milk as there is in a quarter of a lb. of meat. But this is not\r\nthe whole question or nearly the whole. The main question is what the\r\npatient's stomach can assimilate or derive nourishment from, and of this\r\nthe patient's stomach is the sole judge. Chemistry cannot tell this. The\r\npatient's stomach must be its own chemist. The diet which will keep the\r\nhealthy man healthy, will kill the sick one. The same beef which is the\r\nmost nutritive of all meat and which nourishes the healthy man, is the\r\nleast nourishing of all food to the sick man, whose half-dead stomach\r\ncan _assimilate_ no part of it, that is, make no food out of it. On a\r\ndiet of beef tea healthy men on the other hand speedily lose their\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Home-made bread.]\r\n\r\nI have known patients live for many months without touching bread,\r\nbecause they could not eat baker's bread. These were mostly country\r\npatients, but not all. Home-made bread or brown bread is a most\r\nimportant article of diet for many patients. The use of aperients may be\r\nentirely superseded by it. Oat cake is another.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sound observation has scarcely yet been brought to bear on\r\nsick diet.]\r\n\r\nTo watch for the opinions, then, which the patient's stomach gives,\r\nrather than to read \"analyses of foods,\" is the business of all those\r\nwho have to settle what the patient is to eat--perhaps the most\r\nimportant thing to be provided for him after the air he is to breathe.\r\n\r\nNow the medical man who sees the patient only once a day or even only\r\nonce or twice a week, cannot possibly tell this without the assistance\r\nof the patient himself, or of those who are in constant observation on\r\nthe patient. The utmost the medical man can tell is whether the patient\r\nis weaker or stronger at this visit than he was at the last visit. I\r\nshould therefore say that incomparably the most important office of the\r\nnurse, after she has taken care of the patient's air, is to take care\r\nto observe the effect of his food, and report it to the medical\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\nIt is quite incalculable the good that would certainly come from such\r\n_sound_ and close observation in this almost neglected branch of\r\nnursing, or the help it would give to the medical man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tea and coffee.]\r\n\r\nA great deal too much against tea[24] is said by wise people, and a\r\ngreat deal too much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people. When\r\nyou see the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for\r\ntheir \"tea,\" you cannot but feel that nature knows what she is about.\r\nBut a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as a great deal,\r\nand a great deal of tea and especially of coffee impairs the little\r\npower of digestion they have. Yet a nurse because she sees how one or\r\ntwo cups of tea or coffee restores her patient, thinks that three or\r\nfour cups will do twice as much. This is not the case at all; it is\r\nhowever certain that there is nothing yet discovered which is a\r\nsubstitute to the English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it\r\nwhen he can take nothing else, and he often can't take anything else if\r\nhe has it not. I should be very glad if any of the abusers of tea would\r\npoint out what to give to an English patient after a sleepless night,\r\ninstead of tea. If you give it at 5 or 6 o'clock in the morning, he may\r\neven sometimes fall asleep after it, and get perhaps his only two or\r\nthree hours' sleep during the twenty-four. At the same time you never\r\nshould give tea or coffee to the sick, as a rule, after 5 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. Sleeplessness in the early night is from excitement generally\r\nand is increased by tea or coffee; sleeplessness which continues to the\r\nearly morning is from exhaustion often, and is relieved by tea. The only\r\nEnglish patients I have ever known refuse tea, have been typhus cases,\r\nand the first sign of their getting better was their craving again for\r\ntea. In general, the dry and dirty tongue always prefers tea to coffee,\r\nand will quite decline milk, unless with tea. Coffee is a better\r\nrestorative than tea, but a greater impairer of the digestion. Let the\r\npatient's taste decide. You will say that, in cases of great thirst, the\r\npatient's craving decides that it will drink _a great deal_ of tea, and\r\nthat you cannot help it. But in these cases be sure that the patient\r\nrequires diluents for quite other purposes than quenching the thirst; he\r\nwants a great deal of some drink, not only of tea, and the doctor will\r\norder what he is to have, barley water or lemonade, or soda water and\r\nmilk, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nLehmann, quoted by Dr. Christison, says that, among the well and active\r\n\"the infusion of 1 oz. of roasted coffee daily will diminish the waste\"\r\ngoing on in the body \"by one-fourth,\" and Dr. Christison adds that tea\r\nhas the same property. Now this is actual experiment. Lehmann weighs the\r\nman and finds the fact from his weight. It is not deduced from any\r\n\"analysis\" of food. All experience among the sick shows the same\r\nthing.[25]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cocoa.]\r\n\r\nCocoa is often recommended to the sick in lieu of tea or coffee. But\r\nindependently of the fact that English sick very generally dislike\r\ncocoa, it has quite a different effect from tea or coffee. It is an oily\r\nstarchy nut having no restorative power at all, but simply increasing\r\nfat. It is pure mockery of the sick, therefore, to call it a substitute\r\nfor tea. For any renovating stimulus it has, you might just as well\r\noffer them chesnuts instead of tea.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bulk.]\r\n\r\nAn almost universal error among nurses is in the bulk of the food and\r\nespecially the drinks they offer to their patients. Suppose a patient\r\nordered 4 oz. brandy during the day, how is he to take this if you make\r\nit into four pints with diluting it? The same with tea and beef tea,\r\nwith arrowroot, milk, &c. You have not increased the nourishment, you\r\nhave not increased the renovating power of these articles, by increasing\r\ntheir bulk,--you have very likely diminished both by giving the\r\npatient's digestion more to do, and most likely of all, the patient will\r\nleave half of what he has been ordered to take, because he cannot\r\nswallow the bulk with which you have been pleased to invest it. It\r\nrequires very nice observation and care (and meets with hardly any) to\r\ndetermine what will not be too thick or strong for the patient to take,\r\nwhile giving him no more than the bulk which he is able to swallow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. BED AND BEDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Feverishness a symptom of bedding.]\r\n\r\nA few words upon bedsteads and bedding; and principally as regards\r\npatients who are entirely, or almost entirely, confined to bed.\r\n\r\nFeverishness is generally supposed to be a symptom of fever--in nine\r\ncases out of ten it is a symptom of bedding.[26] The patient has had\r\nre-introduced into the body the emanations from himself which day after\r\nday and week after week saturate his unaired bedding. How can it be\r\notherwise? Look at the ordinary bed in which a patient lies.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Uncleanliness of ordinary bedding.]\r\n\r\nIf I were looking out for an example in order to show what _not_ to do,\r\nI should take the specimen of an ordinary bed in a private house: a\r\nwooden bedstead, two or even three mattresses piled up to above the\r\nheight of a table; a vallance attached to the frame--nothing but a\r\nmiracle could ever thoroughly dry or air such a bed and bedding. The\r\npatient must inevitably alternate between cold damp after his bed is\r\nmade, and warm damp before, both saturated with organic matter,[27] and\r\nthis from the time the mattresses are put under him till the time they\r\nare picked to pieces, if this is ever done.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Air your dirty sheets, not only your clean ones.]\r\n\r\nIf you consider that an adult in health exhales by the lungs and skin in\r\nthe twenty-four hours three pints at least of moisture, loaded with\r\norganic matter ready to enter into putrefaction; that in sickness the\r\nquantity is often greatly increased, the quality is always more\r\nnoxious--just ask yourself next where does all this moisture go to?\r\nChiefly into the bedding, because it cannot go anywhere else. And it\r\nstays there; because, except perhaps a weekly change of sheets, scarcely\r\nany other airing is attempted. A nurse will be careful to fidgetiness\r\nabout airing the clean sheets from clean damp, but airing the dirty\r\nsheets from noxious damp will never even occur to her. Besides this, the\r\nmost dangerous effluvia we know of are from the excreta of the\r\nsick--these are placed, at least temporarily, where they must throw\r\ntheir effluvia into the under side of the bed, and the space under the\r\nbed is never aired; it cannot be, with our arrangements. Must not such a\r\nbed be always saturated, and be always the means of re-introducing into\r\nthe system of the unfortunate patient who lies in it, that\r\nexcrementitious matter to eliminate which from the body nature had\r\nexpressly appointed the disease?\r\n\r\nMy heart always sinks within me when I hear the good house-wife, of\r\nevery class, say, \"I assure you the bed has been well slept in,\" and I\r\ncan only hope it is not true. What? is the bed already saturated with\r\nsomebody else's damp before my patient comes to exhale into it his own\r\ndamp? Has it not had a single chance to be aired? No, not one. \"It has\r\nbeen slept in every night.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Iron spring bedstead the best.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comfort and cleanliness of _two_ beds.]\r\n\r\nThe only way of really nursing a real patient is to have an _iron_\r\nbedstead, with rheocline springs, which are permeable by the air up to\r\nthe very mattress (no vallance, of course), the mattress to be a thin\r\nhair one; the bed to be not above 3-1/2 feet wide. If the patient be\r\nentirely confined to his bed, there should be _two_ such bedsteads; each\r\nbed to be \"made\" with mattress, sheets, blankets, &c., complete--the\r\npatient to pass twelve hours in each bed; on no account to carry his\r\nsheets with him. The whole of the bedding to be hung up to air for each\r\nintermediate twelve hours. Of course there are many cases where this\r\ncannot be done at all--many more where only an approach to it can be\r\nmade. I am indicating the ideal of nursing, and what I have actually had\r\ndone. But about the kind of bedstead there can be no doubt, whether\r\nthere be one or two provided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bed not to be too wide.]\r\n\r\nThere is a prejudice in favour of a wide bed--I believe it to be a\r\nprejudice. All the refreshment of moving a patient from one side to the\r\nother of his bed is far more effectually secured by putting him into a\r\nfresh bed; and a patient who is really very ill does not stray far in\r\nbed. But it is said there is no room to put a tray down on a narrow bed.\r\nNo good nurse will ever put a tray on a bed at all. If the patient can\r\nturn on his side, he will eat more comfortably from a bed-side table;\r\nand on no account whatever should a bed ever be higher than a sofa.\r\nOtherwise the patient feels himself \"out of humanity's reach\"; he can\r\nget at nothing for himself: he can move nothing for himself. If the\r\npatient cannot turn, a table over the bed is a better thing. I need\r\nhardly say that a patient's bed should never have its side against the\r\nwall. The nurse must be able to get easily to both sides the bed, and to\r\nreach easily every part of the patient without stretching--a thing\r\nimpossible if the bed be either too wide or too high.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bed not to be too high.]\r\n\r\nWhen I see a patient in a room nine or ten feet high upon a bed between\r\nfour and five feet high, with his head, when he is sitting up in bed,\r\nactually within two or three feet of the ceiling, I ask myself, is this\r\nexpressly planned to produce that peculiarly distressing feeling common\r\nto the sick, viz., as if the walls and ceiling were closing in upon\r\nthem, and they becoming sandwiches between floor and ceiling, which\r\nimagination is not, indeed, here so far from the truth? If, over and\r\nabove this, the window stops short of the ceiling, then the patient's\r\nhead may literally be raised above the stratum of fresh air, even when\r\nthe window is open. Can human perversity any farther go, in unmaking the\r\nprocess of restoration which God has made? The fact is, that the heads\r\nof sleepers or of sick should never be higher than the throat of the\r\nchimney, which ensures their being in the current of best air. And we\r\nwill not suppose it possible that you have closed your chimney with a\r\nchimney-board.\r\n\r\nIf a bed is higher than a sofa, the difference of the fatigue of getting\r\nin and out of bed will just make the difference, very often, to the\r\npatient (who can get in and out of bed at all) of being able to take a\r\nfew minutes' exercise, either in the open air or in another room. It is\r\nso very odd that people never think of this, or of how many more times a\r\npatient who is in bed for the twenty-four hours is obliged to get in and\r\nout of bed than they are, who only, it is to be hoped, get into bed once\r\nand out of bed once during the twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor in a dark place.]\r\n\r\nA patient's bed should always be in the lightest spot in the room; and\r\nhe should be able to see out of window.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nor a four poster with curtains.]\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that the old four-post bed with curtains is utterly\r\ninadmissible, whether for sick or well. Hospital bedsteads are in many\r\nrespects very much less objectionable than private ones.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scrofula often a result of disposition of bedclothes.]\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that not a few of the apparently\r\nunaccountable cases of scrofula among children proceed from the habit of\r\nsleeping with the head under the bed clothes, and so inhaling air\r\nalready breathed, which is farther contaminated by exhalations from the\r\nskin. Patients are sometimes given to a similar habit, and it often\r\nhappens that the bed clothes are so disposed that the patient must\r\nnecessarily breathe air more or less contaminated by exhalations from\r\nhis skin. A good nurse will be careful to attend to this. It is an\r\nimportant part, so to speak, of ventilation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bed sores.]\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to remark, that where there is any danger of\r\nbed-sores a blanket should never be placed _under_ the patient. It\r\nretains damp and acts like a poultice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Heavy and impervious bedclothes.]\r\n\r\nNever use anything but light Witney blankets as bed covering for the\r\nsick. The heavy cotton impervious counterpane is bad, for the very\r\nreason that it keeps in the emanations from the sick person, while the\r\nblanket allows them to pass through. Weak patients are invariably\r\ndistressed by a great weight of bed-clothes, which often prevents their\r\ngetting any sound sleep whatever.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--One word about pillows. Every weak patient, be his illness\r\n    what it may, suffers more or less from difficulty in breathing. To\r\n    take the weight of the body off the poor chest, which is hardly up\r\n    to its work as it is, ought therefore to be the object of the nurse\r\n    in arranging his pillows. Now what does she do and what are the\r\n    consequences? She piles the pillows one a-top of the other like a\r\n    wall of bricks. The head is thrown upon the chest. And the shoulders\r\n    are pushed forward, so as not to allow the lungs room to expand. The\r\n    pillows, in fact, lean upon the patient, not the patient upon the\r\n    pillows. It is impossible to give a rule for this, because it must\r\n    vary with the figure of the patient. And tall patients suffer much\r\n    more than short ones, because of the _drag_ of the long limbs upon\r\n    the waist. But the object is to support, with the pillows, the back\r\n    _below_ the breathing apparatus, to allow the shoulders room to fall\r\n    back, and to support the head, without throwing it forward. The\r\n    suffering of dying patients is immensely increased by neglect of\r\n    these points. And many an invalid, too weak to drag about his\r\n    pillows himself, slips his book or anything at hand behind the lower\r\n    part of his back to support it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Light essential to both health and recovery.]\r\n\r\nIt is the unqualified result of all my experience with the sick, that\r\nsecond only to their need of fresh air is their need of light; that,\r\nafter a close room, what hurts them most is a dark room. And that it is\r\nnot only light but direct sun-light they want. I had rather have the\r\npower of carrying my patient about after the sun, according to the\r\naspect of the rooms, if circumstances permit, than let him linger in a\r\nroom when the sun is off. People think the effect is upon the spirits\r\nonly. This is by no means the case. The sun is not only a painter but a\r\nsculptor. You admit that he does the photograph. Without going into any\r\nscientific exposition we must admit that light has quite as real and\r\ntangible effects upon the human body. But this is not all. Who has not\r\nobserved the purifying effect of light, and especially of direct\r\nsunlight, upon the air of a room? Here is an observation within\r\neverybody's experience. Go into a room where the shutters are always\r\nshut, (in a sick room or a bedroom there should never be shutters shut),\r\nand though the room be uninhabited, though the air has never been\r\npolluted by the breathing of human beings, you will observe a close,\r\nmusty smell of corrupt air, of air i.e. unpurified by the effect of\r\nthe sun's rays. The mustiness of dark rooms and corners, indeed, is\r\nproverbial. The cheerfulness of a room, the usefulness of light in\r\ntreating disease is all-important.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aspect, view, and sunlight matters of first importance to the\r\nsick.]\r\n\r\nA very high authority in hospital construction has said that people do\r\nnot enough consider the difference between wards and dormitories in\r\nplanning their buildings. But I go farther, and say, that healthy people\r\nnever remember the difference between _bed_-rooms and _sick_-rooms, in\r\nmaking arrangements for the sick. To a sleeper in health it does not\r\nsignify what the view is from his bed. He ought never to be in it\r\nexcepting when asleep, and at night. Aspect does not very much signify\r\neither (provided the sun reach his bed-room some time in every day, to\r\npurify the air), because he ought never to be in his bed-room except\r\nduring the hours when there is no sun. But the case is exactly reversed\r\nwith the sick, even should they be as many hours out of their beds as\r\nyou are in yours, which probably they are not. Therefore, that they\r\nshould be able, without raising themselves or turning in bed, to see out\r\nof window from their beds, to see sky and sun-light at least, if you can\r\nshow them nothing else, I assert to be, if not of the very first\r\nimportance for recovery, at least something very near it. And you should\r\ntherefore look to the position of the beds of your sick one of the very\r\nfirst things. If they can see out of two windows instead of one, so much\r\nthe better. Again, the morning sun and the mid-day sun--the hours when\r\nthey are quite certain not to be up, are of more importance to them, if\r\na choice must be made, than the afternoon sun. Perhaps you can take them\r\nout of bed in the afternoon and set them by the window, where they can\r\nsee the sun. But the best rule is, if possible, to give them direct\r\nsun-light from the moment he rises till the moment he sets.\r\n\r\nAnother great difference between the _bed_-room and the _sick_-room is,\r\nthat the _sleeper_ has a very large balance of fresh air to begin with,\r\nwhen he begins the night, if his room has been open all day as it ought\r\nto be; the _sick_ man has not, because all day he has been breathing\r\nthe air in the same room, and dirtying it by the emanations from\r\nhimself. Far more care is therefore necessary to keep up a constant\r\nchange of air in the sick room.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to add that there are acute cases, (particularly\r\na few ophthalmic cases, and diseases where the eye is morbidly\r\nsensitive), where a subdued light is necessary. But a dark north room is\r\ninadmissible even for these. You can always moderate the light by blinds\r\nand curtains.\r\n\r\nHeavy, thick, dark window or bed curtains should, however, hardly ever\r\nbe used for any kind of sick in this country. A light white curtain at\r\nthe head of the bed is, in general, all that is necessary, and a green\r\nblind to the window, to be drawn down only when necessary.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Without sunlight, we degenerate body and mind.]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest observers of human things (not physiological), says,\r\nin another language, \"Where there is sun there is thought.\" All\r\nphysiology goes to confirm this. Where is the shady side of deep\r\nvalleys, there is cretinism. Where are cellars and the unsunned sides of\r\nnarrow streets, there is the degeneracy and weakliness of the human\r\nrace--mind and body equally degenerating. Put the pale withering plant\r\nand human being into the sun, and, if not too far gone, each will\r\nrecover health and spirit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Almost all patients lie with their faces to the light.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing to observe how almost all patients lie with their\r\nfaces turned to the light, exactly as plants always make their faces\r\nturned to the light; a patient will even complain that it gives him pain\r\n\"lying on that side.\" \"Then why _do_ you lie on that side?\" He does not\r\nknow,--but we do. It is because it is the side towards the window. A\r\nfashionable physician has recently published in a government report that\r\nhe always turns his patients' faces from the light. Yes, but nature is\r\nstronger than fashionable physicians, and depend upon it she turns the\r\nfaces back and _towards_ such light as she can get. Walk through the\r\nwards of a hospital, remember the bed sides of private patients you have\r\nseen, and count how many sick you ever saw lying with their faces\r\ntowards the wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. CLEANLINESS OF ROOMS AND WALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cleanliness of carpets and furniture.]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be necessary to tell a nurse that she should be clean, or that\r\nshe should keep her patient clean,--seeing that the greater part of\r\nnursing consists in preserving cleanliness. No ventilation can freshen a\r\nroom or ward where the most scrupulous cleanliness is not observed.\r\nUnless the wind be blowing through the windows at the rate of twenty\r\nmiles an hour, dusty carpets, dirty wainscots, musty curtains and\r\nfurniture, will infallibly produce a close smell. I have lived in a\r\nlarge and expensively furnished London house, where the only constant\r\ninmate in two very lofty rooms, with opposite windows, was myself, and\r\nyet, owing to the abovementioned dirty circumstances, no opening of\r\nwindows could ever keep those rooms free from closeness; but the carpet\r\nand curtains having been turned out of the rooms altogether, they became\r\ninstantly as fresh as could be wished. It is pure nonsense to say that\r\nin London a room cannot be kept clean. Many of our hospitals show the\r\nexact reverse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dust never removed now.]\r\n\r\nBut no particle of dust is ever or can ever be removed or really got rid\r\nof by the present system of dusting. Dusting in these days means nothing\r\nbut flapping the dust from one part of a room on to another with doors\r\nand windows closed. What you do it for I cannot think. You had much\r\nbetter leave the dust alone, if you are not going to take it away\r\naltogether. For from the time a room begins to be a room up to the time\r\nwhen it ceases to be one, no one atom of dust ever actually leaves its\r\nprecincts. Tidying a room means nothing now but removing a thing from\r\none place, which it has kept clean for itself, on to another and a\r\ndirtier one.[28] Flapping by way of cleaning is only admissible in the\r\ncase of pictures, or anything made of paper. The only way I know to\r\n_remove_ dust, the plague of all lovers of fresh air, is to wipe\r\neverything with a damp cloth. And all furniture ought to be so made as\r\nthat it may be wiped with a damp cloth without injury to itself, and so\r\npolished as that it may be damped without injury to others. To dust, as\r\nit is now practised, truly means to distribute dust more equally over a\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Floors.]\r\n\r\nAs to floors, the only really clean floor I know is the Berlin\r\n_lackered_ floor, which is wet rubbed and dry rubbed every morning to\r\nremove the dust. The French _parquet_ is always more or less dusty,\r\nalthough infinitely superior in point of cleanliness and healthiness to\r\nour absorbent floor.\r\n\r\nFor a sick room, a carpet is perhaps the worst expedient which could by\r\nany possibility have been invented. If you must have a carpet, the only\r\nsafety is to take it up two or three times a year, instead of once. A\r\ndirty carpet literally infects the room. And if you consider the\r\nenormous quantity of organic matter from the feet of people coming in,\r\nwhich must saturate it, this is by no means surprising.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Papered, plastered, oil-painted walls.]\r\n\r\nAs for walls, the worst is the papered wall; the next worst is plaster.\r\nBut the plaster can be redeemed by frequent lime-washing; the paper\r\nrequires frequent renewing. A glazed paper gets rid of a good deal of\r\nthe danger. But the ordinary bed-room paper is all that it ought _not_\r\nto be.[29]\r\n\r\nThe close connection between ventilation and cleanliness is shown in\r\nthis. An ordinary light paper will last clean much longer if there is an\r\nArnott's ventilator in the chimney than it otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThe best wall now extant is oil paint. From this you can wash the animal\r\nexuviæ.[30]\r\n\r\nThese are what make a room musty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Best kind of wall for a sick-room.]\r\n\r\nThe best wall for a sick-room or ward that could be made is pure white\r\nnon-absorbent cement or glass, or glazed tiles, if they were made\r\nsightly enough.\r\n\r\nAir can be soiled just like water. If you blow into water you will soil\r\nit with the animal matter from your breath. So it is with air. Air is\r\nalways soiled in a room where walls and carpets are saturated with\r\nanimal exhalations.\r\n\r\nWant of cleanliness, then, in rooms and wards, which you have to guard\r\nagainst, may arise in three ways.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dirty air from without.]\r\n\r\n1. Dirty air coming in from without, soiled by sewer emanations, the\r\nevaporation from dirty streets, smoke, bits of unburnt fuel, bits of\r\nstraw, bits of horse dung.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Best kind of wall for a house.]\r\n\r\nIf people would but cover the outside walls of their houses with plain\r\nor encaustic tiles, what an incalculable improvement would there be in\r\nlight, cleanliness, dryness, warmth, and consequently economy. The play\r\nof a fire-engine would then effectually wash the outside of a house.\r\nThis kind of _walling_ would stand next to paving in improving the\r\nhealth of towns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dirty air from within.]\r\n\r\n2. Dirty air coming from within, from dust, which you often displace,\r\nbut never remove. And this recalls what ought to be a _sine quâ non_.\r\nHave as few ledges in your room or ward as possible. And under no\r\npretence have any ledge whatever out of sight. Dust accumulates there,\r\nand will never be wiped off. This is a certain way to soil the air.\r\nBesides this, the animal exhalations from your inmates saturate your\r\nfurniture. And if you never clean your furniture properly, how can your\r\nrooms or wards be anything but musty? Ventilate as you please, the rooms\r\nwill never be sweet. Besides this, there is a constant _degradation_, as\r\nit is called, taking place from everything except polished or glazed\r\narticles--_E.g._, in colouring certain green papers arsenic is used. Now\r\nin the very dust even, which is lying about in rooms hung with this kind\r\nof green paper, arsenic has been distinctly detected. You see your dust\r\nis anything but harmless; yet you will let such dust lie about your\r\nledges for months, your rooms for ever.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fire fills the room with coal-dust.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dirty air from the carpet.]\r\n\r\n3. Dirty air coming from the carpet. Above all, take care of the\r\ncarpets, that the animal dirt left there by the feet of visitors does\r\nnot stay there. Floors, unless the grain is filled up and polished, are\r\njust as bad. The smell from the floor of a school-room or ward, when any\r\nmoisture brings out the organic matter by which it is saturated, might\r\nalone be enough to warn us of the mischief that is going on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Remedies.]\r\n\r\nThe outer air, then, can only be kept clean by sanitary improvements,\r\nand by consuming smoke. The expense in soap, which this single\r\nimprovement would save, is quite incalculable.\r\n\r\nThe inside air can only be kept clean by excessive care in the ways\r\nmentioned above--to rid the walls, carpets, furniture, ledges, &c., of\r\nthe organic matter and dust--dust consisting greatly of this organic\r\nmatter--with which they become saturated, and which is what really makes\r\nthe room musty.\r\n\r\nWithout cleanliness, you cannot have all the effect of ventilation;\r\nwithout ventilation, you can have no thorough cleanliness.\r\n\r\nVery few people, be they of what class they may, have any idea of the\r\nexquisite cleanliness required in the sick-room. For much of what I have\r\nsaid applies less to the hospital than to the private sick-room. The\r\nsmoky chimney, the dusty furniture, the utensils emptied but once a day,\r\noften keep the air of the sick constantly dirty in the best private\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nThe well have a curious habit of forgetting that what is to them but a\r\ntrifling inconvenience, to be patiently \"put up\" with, is to the sick a\r\nsource of suffering, delaying recovery, if not actually hastening death.\r\nThe well are scarcely ever more than eight hours, at most, in the same\r\nroom. Some change they can always make, if only for a few minutes. Even\r\nduring the supposed eight hours, they can change their posture or their\r\nposition in the room. But the sick man, who never leaves his bed, who\r\ncannot change by any movement of his own his air, or his light, or his\r\nwarmth; who cannot obtain quiet, or get out of the smoke, or the smell,\r\nor the dust; he is really poisoned or depressed by what is to you the\r\nmerest trifle.\r\n\r\n\"What can't be cured must be endured,\" is the very worst and most\r\ndangerous maxim for a nurse which ever was made. Patience and\r\nresignation in her are but other words for carelessness or\r\nindifference--contemptible, if in regard to herself; culpable, if in\r\nregard to her sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. PERSONAL CLEANLINESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poisoning by the skin.]\r\n\r\nIn almost all diseases, the function of the skin is, more or less,\r\ndisordered; and in many most important diseases nature relieves herself\r\nalmost entirely by the skin. This is particularly the case with\r\nchildren. But the excretion, which comes from the skin, is left there,\r\nunless removed by washing or by the clothes. Every nurse should keep\r\nthis fact constantly in mind,--for, if she allow her sick to remain\r\nunwashed, or their clothing to remain on them after being saturated with\r\nperspiration or other excretion, she is interfering injuriously with the\r\nnatural processes of health just as effectually as if she were to give\r\nthe patient a dose of slow poison by the mouth. Poisoning by the skin is\r\nno less certain than poisoning by the mouth--only it is slower in its\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ventilation and skin-cleanliness equally essential.]\r\n\r\nThe amount of relief and comfort experienced by sick after the skin has\r\nbeen carefully washed and dried, is one of the commonest observations\r\nmade at a sick bed. But it must not be forgotten that the comfort and\r\nrelief so obtained are not all. They are, in fact, nothing more than a\r\nsign that the vital powers have been relieved by removing something that\r\nwas oppressing them. The nurse, therefore, must never put off attending\r\nto the personal cleanliness of her patient under the plea that all that\r\nis to be gained is a little relief, which can be quite as well given\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn all well-regulated hospitals this ought to be, and generally is,\r\nattended to. But it is very generally neglected with private sick.\r\n\r\nJust as it is necessary to renew the air round a sick person frequently,\r\nto carry off morbid effluvia from the lungs and skin, by maintaining\r\nfree ventilation, so is it necessary to keep the pores of the skin free\r\nfrom all obstructing excretions. The object, both of ventilation and of\r\nskin-cleanliness, is pretty much the same, to wit, removing noxious\r\nmatter from the system as rapidly as possible.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken in all these operations of sponging, washing, and\r\ncleansing the skin, not to expose too great a surface at once, so as to\r\ncheck the perspiration, which would renew the evil in another form.\r\n\r\nThe various ways of washing the sick need not here be specified,--the\r\nless so as the doctors ought to say which is to be used.\r\n\r\nIn several forms of diarrhoea, dysentery, &c., where the skin is hard and\r\nharsh, the relief afforded by washing with a great deal of soft soap is\r\nincalculable. In other cases, sponging with tepid soap and water, then\r\nwith tepid water and drying with a hot towel will be ordered.\r\n\r\nEvery nurse ought to be careful to wash her hands very frequently during\r\nthe day. If her face too, so much the better.\r\n\r\nOne word as to cleanliness merely as cleanliness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Steaming and rubbing the skin.]\r\n\r\nCompare the dirtiness of the water in which you have washed when it is\r\ncold without soap, cold with soap, hot with soap. You will find the\r\nfirst has hardly removed any dirt at all, the second a little more, the\r\nthird a great deal more. But hold your hand over a cup of hot water for\r\na minute or two, and then, by merely rubbing with the finger, you will\r\nbring off flakes of dirt or dirty skin. After a vapour bath you may peel\r\nyour whole self clean in this way. What I mean is, that by simply\r\nwashing or sponging with water you do not really clean your skin. Take a\r\nrough towel, dip one corner in very hot water,--if a little spirit be\r\nadded to it it will be more effectual,--and then rub as if you were\r\nrubbing the towel into your skin with your fingers. The black flakes\r\nwhich will come off will convince you that you were not clean before,\r\nhowever much soap and water you have used. These flakes are what require\r\nremoving. And you can really keep yourself cleaner with a tumbler of hot\r\nwater and a rough towel and rubbing, than with a whole apparatus of bath\r\nand soap and sponge, without rubbing. It is quite nonsense to say that\r\nanybody need be dirty. Patients have been kept as clean by these means\r\non a long voyage, when a basin full of water could not be afforded, and\r\nwhen they could not be moved out of their berths, as if all the\r\nappurtenances of home had been at hand.\r\n\r\nWashing, however, with a large quantity of water has quite other effects\r\nthan those of mere cleanliness. The skin absorbs the water and becomes\r\nsofter and more perspirable. To wash with soap and soft water is,\r\ntherefore, desirable from other points of view than that of cleanliness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. CHATTERING HOPES AND ADVICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advising the sick.]\r\n\r\nThe sick man to his advisers.\r\n\r\n\"My advisers! Their name is legion. * * * Somehow or other, it seems a\r\nprovision of the universal destinies, that every man, woman, and child\r\nshould consider him, her, or itself privileged especially to advise me.\r\nWhy? That is precisely what I want to know.\" And this is what I have to\r\nsay to them. I have been advised to go to every place extant in and out\r\nof England--to take every kind of exercise by every kind of cart,\r\ncarriage--yes, and even swing (!) and dumb-bell (!) in existence; to\r\nimbibe every different kind of stimulus that ever has been invented. And\r\nthis when those _best_ fitted to know, viz., medical men, after long and\r\nclose attendance, had declared any journey out of the question, had\r\nprohibited any kind of motion whatever, had closely laid down the diet\r\nand drink. What would my advisers say, were they the medical attendants,\r\nand I the patient left their advice, and took the casual adviser's? But\r\nthe singularity in Legion's mind is this: it never occurs to him that\r\neverybody else is doing the same thing, and that I the patient _must_\r\nperforce say, in sheer self-defence, like Rosalind, \"I could not do with\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Chattering hopes the bane of the sick.]\r\n\r\n\"Chattering Hopes\" may seem an odd heading. But I really believe there\r\nis scarcely a greater worry which invalids have to endure than the\r\nincurable hopes of their friends. There is no one practice against which\r\nI can speak more strongly from actual personal experience, wide and\r\nlong, of its effects during sickness observed both upon others and upon\r\nmyself. I would appeal most seriously to all friends, visitors, and\r\nattendants of the sick to leave off this practice of attempting to\r\n\"cheer\" the sick by making light of their danger and by exaggerating\r\ntheir probabilities of recovery.\r\n\r\nFar more now than formerly does the medical attendant tell the truth to\r\nthe sick who are really desirous to hear it about their own state.\r\n\r\nHow intense is the folly, then, to say the least of it, of the friend,\r\nbe he even a medical man, who thinks that his opinion, given after a\r\ncursory observation, will weigh with the patient, against the opinion of\r\nthe medical attendant, given, perhaps, after years of observation, after\r\nusing every help to diagnosis afforded by the stethoscope, the\r\nexamination of pulse, tongue, &c.; and certainly after much more\r\nobservation than the friend can possibly have had.\r\n\r\nSupposing the patient to be possessed of common sense,--how can the\r\n\"favourable\" opinion, if it is to be called an opinion at all, of the\r\ncasual visitor \"cheer\" him,--when different from that of the experienced\r\nattendant? Unquestionably the latter may, and often does, turn out to be\r\nwrong. But which is most likely to be wrong?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Patient does not want to talk of himself.]\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that the patient[31] is not \"cheered\" at all by these\r\nwell-meaning, most tiresome friends. On the contrary, he is depressed\r\nand wearied. If, on the one hand, he exerts himself to tell each\r\nsuccessive member of this too numerous conspiracy, whose name is legion,\r\nwhy he does not think as they do,--in what respect he is worse,--what\r\nsymptoms exist that they know nothing of,--he is fatigued instead of\r\n\"cheered,\" and his attention is fixed upon himself. In general, patients\r\nwho are really ill, do not want to talk about themselves. Hypochondriacs\r\ndo, but again I say we are not on the subject of hypochondriacs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absurd consolations put forth for the benefit of the sick.]\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, and which is much more frequently the case, the\r\npatient says nothing, but the Shakespearian \"Oh!\" \"Ah!\" \"Go to!\" and \"In\r\ngood sooth!\" in order to escape from the conversation about himself the\r\nsooner, he is depressed by want of sympathy. He feels isolated in the\r\nmidst of friends. He feels what a convenience it would be, if there were\r\nany single person to whom he could speak simply and openly, without\r\npulling the string upon himself of this shower-bath of silly hopes and\r\nencouragements; to whom he could express his wishes and directions\r\nwithout that person persisting in saying \"I hope that it will please God\r\nyet to give you twenty years,\" or, \"You have a long life of activity\r\nbefore you.\" How often we see at the end of biographies or of cases\r\nrecorded in medical papers, \"after a long illness A. died rather\r\nsuddenly,\" or, \"unexpectedly both to himself and to others.\"\r\n\"Unexpectedly\" to others, perhaps, who did not see, because they did not\r\nlook; but by no means \"unexpectedly to himself,\" as I feel entitled to\r\nbelieve, both from the internal evidence in such stories, and from\r\nwatching similar cases: there was every reason to expect that A. would\r\ndie, and he knew it; but he found it useless to insist upon his own\r\nknowledge to his friends.\r\n\r\nIn these remarks I am alluding neither to acute cases which terminate\r\nrapidly nor to \"nervous\" cases.\r\n\r\nBy the first much interest in their own danger is very rarely felt. In\r\nwritings of fiction, whether novels or biographies, these death-beds are\r\ngenerally depicted as almost seraphic in lucidity of intelligence. Sadly\r\nlarge has been my experience in death-beds, and I can only say that I\r\nhave seldom or never seen such. Indifference, excepting with regard to\r\nbodily suffering, or to some duty the dying man desires to perform, is\r\nthe far more usual state.\r\n\r\nThe \"nervous case,\" on the other hand, delights in figuring to himself\r\nand others a fictitious danger.\r\n\r\nBut the long chronic case, who knows too well himself, and who has been\r\ntold by his physician that he will never enter active life again, who\r\nfeels that every month he has to give up something he could do the month\r\nbefore--oh! spare such sufferers your chattering hopes. You do not know\r\nhow you worry and weary them. Such real sufferers cannot bear to talk of\r\nthemselves, still less to hope for what they cannot at all expect.\r\n\r\nSo also as to all the advice showered so profusely upon such sick, to\r\nleave off some occupation, to try some other doctor, some other house,\r\nclimate, pill, powder, or specific; I say nothing of the\r\ninconsistency--for these advisers are sure to be the same persons who\r\nexhorted the sick man not to believe his own doctor's prognostics,\r\nbecause \"doctors are always mistaken,\" but to believe some other doctor,\r\nbecause \"this doctor is always right.\" Sure also are these advisers to\r\nbe the persons to bring the sick man fresh occupation, while exhorting\r\nhim to leave his own.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wonderful presumption of the advisers of the sick.]\r\n\r\nWonderful is the face with which friends, lay and medical, will come in\r\nand worry the patient with recommendations to do something or other,\r\nhaving just as little knowledge as to its being feasible, or even safe\r\nfor him, as if they were to recommend a man to take exercise, not\r\nknowing he had broken his leg. What would the friend say, if _he_ were\r\nthe medical attendant, and if the patient, because some _other_ friend\r\nhad come in, because somebody, anybody, nobody, had recommended\r\nsomething, anything, nothing, were to disregard _his_ orders, and take\r\nthat other body's recommendation? But people never think of this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Advisers the same now as two hundred years ago.]\r\n\r\nA celebrated historical personage has related the commonplaces which,\r\nwhen on the eve of executing a remarkable resolution, were showered in\r\nnearly the same words by every one around successively for a period of\r\nsix months. To these the personage states that it was found least\r\ntrouble always to reply the same thing, viz., that it could not be\r\nsupposed that such a resolution had been taken without sufficient\r\nprevious consideration. To patients enduring every day for years from\r\nevery friend or acquaintance, either by letter or _vivâ voce_, some\r\ntorment of this kind, I would suggest the same answer. It would indeed\r\nbe spared, if such friends and acquaintances would but consider for one\r\nmoment, that it is probable the patient has heard such advice at least\r\nfifty times before, and that, had it been practicable, it would have\r\nbeen practised long ago. But of such consideration there appears to be\r\nno chance. Strange, though true, that people should be just the same in\r\nthese things as they were a few hundred years ago!\r\n\r\nTo me these commonplaces, leaving their smear upon the cheerful,\r\nsingle-hearted, constant devotion to duty, which is so often seen in the\r\ndecline of such sufferers, recall the slimy trail left by the snail on\r\nthe sunny southern garden-wall loaded with fruit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mockery of the advice given to sick.]\r\n\r\nNo mockery in the world is so hollow as the advice showered upon the\r\nsick. It is of no use for the sick to say anything, for what the adviser\r\nwants is, _not_ to know the truth about the state of the patient, but to\r\nturn whatever the sick may say to the support of his own argument, set\r\nforth, it must be repeated, without any inquiry whatever into the\r\npatient's real condition. \"But it would be impertinent or indecent in me\r\nto make such an inquiry,\" says the adviser. True; and how much more\r\nimpertinent is it to give your advice when you can know nothing about\r\nthe truth, and admit you could not inquire into it.\r\n\r\nTo nurses I say--these are the visitors who do your patient harm. When\r\nyou hear him told:--1. That he has nothing the matter with him, and that\r\nhe wants cheering. 2. That he is committing suicide, and that he wants\r\npreventing. 3. That he is the tool of somebody who makes use of him for\r\na purpose. 4. That he will listen to nobody, but is obstinately bent\r\nupon his own way; and 5. That he ought to be called to the sense of\r\nduty, and is flying in the face of Providence;--then know that your\r\npatient is receiving all the injury that he can receive from a visitor.\r\n\r\nHow little the real sufferings of illness are known or understood. How\r\nlittle does any one in good health fancy him or even _her_self into the\r\nlife of a sick person.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of giving pleasure to the sick.]\r\n\r\nDo, you who are about the sick or who visit the sick, try and give them\r\npleasure, remember to tell them what will do so. How often in such\r\nvisits the sick person has to do the whole conversation, exerting his\r\nown imagination and memory, while you would take the visitor, absorbed\r\nin his own anxieties, making no effort of memory or imagination, for the\r\nsick person. \"Oh! my dear, I have so much to think of, I really quite\r\nforgot to tell him that; besides, I thought he would know it,\" says the\r\nvisitor to another friend. How could \"he know it\"? Depend upon it, the\r\npeople who say this are really those who have little \"to think of.\"\r\nThere are many burthened with business who always manage to keep a\r\npigeon-hole in their minds, full of things to tell the \"invalid.\"\r\n\r\nI do not say, don't tell him your anxieties--I believe it is good for\r\nhim and good for you too; but if you tell him what is anxious, surely\r\nyou can remember to tell him what is pleasant too.\r\n\r\nA sick person does so enjoy hearing good news:--for instance, of a love\r\nand courtship, while in progress to a good ending. If you tell him only\r\nwhen the marriage takes place, he loses half the pleasure, which God\r\nknows he has little enough of; and ten to one but you have told him of\r\nsome love-making with a bad ending.\r\n\r\nA sick person also intensely enjoys hearing of any _material_ good, any\r\npositive or practical success of the right. He has so much of books and\r\nfiction, of principles, and precepts, and theories; do, instead of\r\nadvising him with advice he has heard at least fifty times before, tell\r\nhim of one benevolent act which has really succeeded practically,--it is\r\nlike a day's health to him.[32]\r\n\r\nYou have no idea what the craving of sick with undiminished power of\r\nthinking, but little power of doing, is to hear of good practical\r\naction, when they can no longer partake in it.\r\n\r\nDo observe these things with the sick. Do remember how their life is to\r\nthem disappointed and incomplete. You see them lying there with\r\nmiserable disappointments, from which they can have no escape but death,\r\nand you can't remember to tell them of what would give them so much\r\npleasure, or at least an hour's variety.\r\n\r\nThey don't want you to be lachrymose and whining with them, they like\r\nyou to be fresh and active and interested, but they cannot bear absence\r\nof mind, and they are so tired of the advice and preaching they receive\r\nfrom every body, no matter whom it is, they see.\r\n\r\nThere is no better society than babies and sick people for one another.\r\nOf course you must manage this so that neither shall suffer from it,\r\nwhich is perfectly possible. If you think the \"air of the sick room\" bad\r\nfor the baby, why it is bad for the invalid too, and, therefore, you\r\nwill of course correct it for both. It freshens up a sick person's whole\r\nmental atmosphere to see \"the baby.\" And a very young child, if\r\nunspoiled, will generally adapt itself wonderfully to the ways of a sick\r\nperson, if the time they spend together is not too long.\r\n\r\nIf you knew how unreasonably sick people suffer from reasonable causes\r\nof distress, you would take more pains about all these things. An infant\r\nlaid upon the sick bed will do the sick person, thus suffering, more\r\ngood than all your logic. A piece of good news will do the same. Perhaps\r\nyou are afraid of \"disturbing\" him. You say there is no comfort for his\r\npresent cause of affliction. It is perfectly reasonable. The\r\ndistinction is this, if he is obliged to act, do not \"disturb\" him with\r\nanother subject of thought just yet; help him to do what he wants to do:\r\nbut, if he _has_ done this, or if nothing _can_ be done, then \"disturb\"\r\nhim by all means. You will relieve, more effectually, unreasonable\r\nsuffering from reasonable causes by telling him \"the news,\" showing him\r\n\"the baby,\" or giving him something new to think of or to look at than\r\nby all the logic in the world.\r\n\r\nIt has been very justly said that the sick are like children in this,\r\nthat there is no _proportion_ in events to them. Now it is your business\r\nas their visitor to restore this right proportion for them--to shew them\r\nwhat the rest of the world is doing. How can they find it out otherwise?\r\nYou will find them far more open to conviction than children in this.\r\nAnd you will find that their unreasonable intensity of suffering from\r\nunkindness, from want of sympathy, &c., will disappear with their\r\nfreshened interest in the big world's events. But then you must be able\r\nto give them real interests, not gossip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two new classes of patients peculiar to this generation.]\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--There are two classes of patients which are unfortunately\r\n    becoming more common every day, especially among women of the richer\r\n    orders, to whom all these remarks are pre-eminently inapplicable. 1.\r\n    Those who make health an excuse for doing nothing, and at the same\r\n    time allege that the being able to do nothing is their only grief.\r\n    2. Those who have brought upon themselves ill-health by over pursuit\r\n    of amusement, which they and their friends have most unhappily\r\n    called intellectual activity. I scarcely know a greater injury that\r\n    can be inflicted than the advice too often given to the first class\r\n    \"to vegetate\"--or than the admiration too often bestowed on the\r\n    latter class for \"pluck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. OBSERVATION OF THE SICK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What is the use of the question, Is he better?]\r\n\r\nThere is no more silly or universal question scarcely asked than this,\r\n\"Is he better?\" Ask it of the medical attendant, if you please. But of\r\nwhom else, if you wish for a real answer to your question, would you ask\r\nit? Certainly not of the casual visitor; certainly not of the nurse,\r\nwhile the nurse's observation is so little exercised as it is now. What\r\nyou want are facts, not opinions--for who can have any opinion of any\r\nvalue as to whether the patient is better or worse, excepting the\r\nconstant medical attendant, or the really observing nurse?\r\n\r\nThe most important practical lesson that can be given to nurses is to\r\nteach them what to observe--how to observe--what symptoms indicate\r\nimprovement--what the reverse--which are of importance--which are of\r\nnone--which are the evidence of neglect--and of what kind of neglect.\r\n\r\nAll this is what ought to make part, and an essential part, of the\r\ntraining of every nurse. At present how few there are, either\r\nprofessional or unprofessional, who really know at all whether any sick\r\nperson they may be with is better or worse.\r\n\r\nThe vagueness and looseness of the information one receives in answer to\r\nthat much abused question, \"Is he better?\" would be ludicrous, if it\r\nwere not painful. The only sensible answer (in the present state of\r\nknowledge about sickness) would be \"How can I know? I cannot tell how he\r\nwas when I was not with him.\"\r\n\r\nI can record but a very few specimens of the answers[33] which I have\r\nheard made by friends and nurses, and accepted by physicians and\r\nsurgeons at the very bed-side of the patient, who could have\r\ncontradicted every word, but did not--sometimes from amiability, often\r\nfrom shyness, oftenest from languor!\r\n\r\n\"How often have the bowels acted, nurse?\" \"Once, sir.\" This generally\r\nmeans that the utensil has been emptied once, it having been used\r\nperhaps seven or eight times.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the patient is much weaker than he was six weeks ago?\" \"Oh\r\nno, sir; you know it is very long since he has been up and dressed, and\r\nhe can get across the room now.\" This means that the nurse has not\r\nobserved that whereas six weeks ago he sat up and occupied himself in\r\nbed, he now lies still doing nothing; that, although he can \"get across\r\nthe room,\" he cannot stand for five seconds.\r\n\r\nAnother patient who is eating well, recovering steadily, although\r\nslowly, from fever, but cannot walk or stand, is represented to the\r\ndoctor as making no progress at all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Leading questions useless or misleading.]\r\n\r\nQuestions, too, as asked now (but too generally) of or about patients,\r\nwould obtain no information at all about them, even if the person asked\r\nof had every information to give. The question is generally a leading\r\nquestion; and it is singular that people never think what must be the\r\nanswer to this question before they ask it: for instance, \"Has he had a\r\ngood night?\" Now, one patient will think he has a bad night if he has\r\nnot slept ten hours without waking. Another does not think he has a bad\r\nnight if he has had intervals of dosing occasionally. The same answer\r\nhas actually been given as regarded two patients--one who had been\r\nentirely sleepless for five times twenty-four hours, and died of it, and\r\nanother who had not slept the sleep of a regular night, without waking.\r\nWhy cannot the question be asked, How many hours' sleep has ---- had?\r\nand at what hours of the night?[34] \"I have never closed my eyes all\r\nnight,\" an answer as frequently made when the speaker has had several\r\nhours' sleep as when he has had none, would then be less often said.\r\nLies, intentional and unintentional, are much seldomer told in answer to\r\nprecise than to leading questions. Another frequent error is to inquire\r\nwhether one cause remains, and not whether the effect which may be\r\nproduced by a great many different causes, _not_ inquired after,\r\nremains. As when it is asked, whether there was noise in the street last\r\nnight; and if there were not, the patient is reported, without more ado,\r\nto have had a good night. Patients are completely taken aback by these\r\nkinds of leading questions, and give only the exact amount of\r\ninformation asked for, even when they know it to be completely\r\nmisleading. The shyness of patients is seldom allowed for.\r\n\r\nHow few there are who, by five or six pointed questions, can elicit the\r\nwhole case and get accurately to know and to be able to report _where_\r\nthe patient is.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of obtaining inaccurate information.]\r\n\r\nI knew a very clever physician, of large dispensary and hospital\r\npractice, who invariably began his examination of each patient with \"Put\r\nyour finger where you be bad.\" That man would never waste his time with\r\ncollecting inaccurate information from nurse or patient. Leading\r\nquestions always collect inaccurate information.\r\n\r\nAt a recent celebrated trial, the following leading question was put\r\nsuccessively to nine distinguished medical men. \"Can you attribute these\r\nsymptoms to anything else but poison?\" And out of the nine, eight\r\nanswered \"No!\" without any qualification whatever. It appeared, upon\r\ncross-examination:--1. That none of them had ever seen a case of the\r\nkind of poisoning supposed. 2. That none of them had ever seen a case of\r\nthe kind of disease to which the death, if not to poison, was\r\nattributable. 3. That none of them were even aware of the main fact of\r\nthe disease and condition to which the death was attributable.\r\n\r\nSurely nothing stronger can be adduced to prove what use leading\r\nquestions are of, and what they lead to.\r\n\r\nI had rather not say how many instances I have known, where, owing to\r\nthis system of leading questions, the patient has died, and the\r\nattendants have been actually unaware of the principal feature of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As to food patient takes or does not take.]\r\n\r\nIt is useless to go through all the particulars, besides sleep, in which\r\npeople have a peculiar talent for gleaning inaccurate information. As to\r\nfood, for instance, I often think that most common question, How is your\r\nappetite? can only be put because the questioner believes the questioned\r\nhas really nothing the matter with him, which is very often the case.\r\nBut where there is, the remark holds good which has been made about\r\nsleep. The _same_ answer will often be made as regards a patient who\r\ncannot take two ounces of solid food per diem, and a patient who does\r\nnot enjoy five meals a day as much as usual.\r\n\r\nAgain, the question, How is your appetite? is often put when How is your\r\ndigestion? is the question meant. No doubt the two things depend on one\r\nanother. But they are quite different. Many a patient can eat, if you\r\ncan only \"tempt his appetite.\" The fault lies in your not having got him\r\nthe thing that he fancies. But many another patient does not care\r\nbetween grapes and turnips,--everything is equally distasteful to him.\r\nHe would try to eat anything which would do him good; but everything\r\n\"makes him worse.\" The fault here generally lies in the cooking. It is\r\nnot his \"appetite\" which requires \"tempting,\" it is his digestion which\r\nrequires sparing. And good sick cookery will save the digestion half its\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThere may be four different causes, any one of which will produce the\r\nsame result, viz., the patient slowly starving to death from want of\r\nnutrition:\r\n\r\n1. Defect in cooking;\r\n2. Defect in choice of diet;\r\n3. Defect in choice of hours for taking diet;\r\n4. Defect of appetite in patient.\r\n\r\nYet all these are generally comprehended in the one sweeping assertion\r\nthat the patient has \"no appetite.\"\r\n\r\nSurely many lives might be saved by drawing a closer distinction; for\r\nthe remedies are as diverse as the causes. The remedy for the first is,\r\nto cook better; for the second, to choose other articles of diet; for\r\nthe third, to watch for the hours when the patient is in want of food;\r\nfor the fourth, to show him what he likes, and sometimes unexpectedly.\r\nBut no one of these remedies will do for any other of the defects not\r\ncorresponding with it.\r\n\r\nI cannot too often repeat that patients are generally either too languid\r\nto observe these things, or too shy to speak about them; nor is it well\r\nthat they should be made to observe them, it fixes their attention upon\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, I say, what _is_ the nurse or friend there for except to take\r\nnote of these things, instead of the patient doing so?[35]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: As to diarrhoea.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the question is sometimes put, Is there diarrhoea? And the answer\r\nwill be the same, whether it is just merging into cholera, whether it is\r\na trifling degree brought on by some trifling indiscretion, which will\r\ncease the moment the cause is removed, or whether there is no diarrhoea\r\nat all, but simply relaxed bowels.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to multiply instances of this kind. As long as observation\r\nis so little cultivated as it is now, I do believe that it is better for\r\nthe physician _not_ to see the friends of the patient at all. They will\r\noftener mislead him than not. And as often by making the patient out\r\nworse as better than he really is.\r\n\r\nIn the case of infants, _everything_ must depend upon the accurate\r\nobservation of the nurse or mother who has to report. And how seldom is\r\nthis condition of accuracy fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Means of cultivating sound and ready observation.]\r\n\r\nA celebrated man, though celebrated only for foolish things, has told us\r\nthat one of his main objects in the education of his son, was to give\r\nhim a ready habit of accurate observation, a certainty of perception,\r\nand that for this purpose one of his means was a month's course as\r\nfollows:--he took the boy rapidly past a toy-shop; the father and son\r\nthen described to each other as many of the objects as they could, which\r\nthey had seen in passing the windows, noting them down with pencil and\r\npaper, and returning afterwards to verify their own accuracy. The boy\r\nalways succeeded best, e.g., if the father described 30 objects, the\r\nboy did 40, and scarcely ever made a mistake.\r\n\r\nI have often thought how wise a piece of education this would be for\r\nmuch higher objects; and in our calling of nurses the thing itself is\r\nessential. For it may safely be said, not that the habit of ready and\r\ncorrect observation will by itself make us useful nurses, but that\r\nwithout it we shall be useless with all our devotion.\r\n\r\nI have known a nurse in charge of a set of wards who not only carried in\r\nher head all the little varieties in the diets which each patient was\r\nallowed to fix for himself, but also exactly what each patient had taken\r\nduring each day. I have known another nurse in charge of one single\r\npatient, who took away his meals day after day all but untouched, and\r\nnever knew it.\r\n\r\nIf you find it helps you to note down such things on a bit of paper, in\r\npencil, by all means do so. I think it more often lames than strengthens\r\nthe memory and observation. But if you cannot get the habit of\r\nobservation one way or other, you had better give up the being a nurse,\r\nfor it is not your calling, however kind and anxious you may be.\r\n\r\nSurely you can learn at least to judge with the eye how much an oz. of\r\nsolid food is, how much an oz. of liquid. You will find this helps your\r\nobservation and memory very much, you will then say to yourself \"A. took\r\nabout an oz. of his meat to day;\" \"B. took three times in 24 hours about\r\n1/4 pint of beef tea;\" instead of saying \"B. has taken nothing all day,\"\r\nor \"I gave A. his dinner as usual.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sound and ready observation essential in a nurse.]\r\n\r\nI have known several of our real old-fashioned hospital \"sisters,\" who\r\ncould, as accurately as a measuring glass, measure out all their\r\npatients' wine and medicine by the eye, and never be wrong. I do not\r\nrecommend this, one must be very sure of one's self to do it. I only\r\nmention it, because if a nurse can by practice measure medicine by the\r\neye, surely she is no nurse who cannot measure by the eye about how much\r\nfood (in oz.) her patient has taken.[36] In hospitals those who cut up\r\nthe diets give with quite sufficient accuracy, to each patient, his 12\r\noz. or his 6 oz. of meat without weighing. Yet a nurse will often have\r\npatients loathing all food and incapable of any will to get well, who\r\njust tumble over the contents of the plate or dip the spoon in the cup\r\nto deceive the nurse, and she will take it away without ever seeing that\r\nthere is just the same quantity of food as when she brought it, and she\r\nwill tell the doctor, too, that the patient has eaten all his diets as\r\nusual, when all she ought to have meant is that she has taken away his\r\ndiets as usual.\r\n\r\nNow what kind of a nurse is this?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference of excitable and _accumulative_ temperaments.]\r\n\r\nI would call attention to something else, in which nurses frequently\r\nfail in observation. There is a well-marked distinction between the\r\nexcitable and what I will call the _accumulative_ temperament in\r\npatients. One will blaze up at once, under any shock or anxiety, and\r\nsleep very comfortably after it; another will seem quite calm and even\r\ntorpid, under the same shock, and people say, \"He hardly felt it at\r\nall,\" yet you will find him some time after slowly sinking. The same\r\nremark applies to the action of narcotics, of aperients, which, in the\r\none, take effect directly, in the other not perhaps for twenty-four\r\nhours. A journey, a visit, an unwonted exertion, will affect the one\r\nimmediately, but he recovers after it; the other bears it very well at\r\nthe time, apparently, and dies or is prostrated for life by it. People\r\noften say how difficult the excitable temperament is to manage. I say\r\nhow difficult is the _accumulative_ temperament. With the first you have\r\nan out-break which you could anticipate, and it is all over. With the\r\nsecond you never know where you are--you never know when the\r\nconsequences are over. And it requires your closest observation to know\r\nwhat _are_ the consequences of what--for the consequent by no means\r\nfollows immediately upon the antecedent--and coarse observation is\r\nutterly at fault.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Superstition the fruit of bad observation.]\r\n\r\nAlmost all superstitions are owing to bad observation, to the _post hoc,\r\nergo propter hoc_; and bad observers are almost all superstitious.\r\nFarmers used to attribute disease among cattle to witchcraft; weddings\r\nhave been attributed to seeing one magpie, deaths to seeing three; and I\r\nhave heard the most highly educated now-a-days draw consequences for the\r\nsick closely resembling these.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiognomy of disease little shown by the face.]\r\n\r\nAnother remark: although there is unquestionably a physiognomy of\r\ndisease as well as of health; of all parts of the body, the face is\r\nperhaps the one which tells the least to the common observer or the\r\ncasual visitor. Because, of all parts of the body, it is the one most\r\nexposed to other influences, besides health. And people never, or\r\nscarcely ever, observe enough to know how to distinguish between the\r\neffect of exposure, of robust health, of a tender skin, of a tendency to\r\ncongestion, of suffusion, flushing, or many other things. Again, the\r\nface is often the last to shew emaciation. I should say that the hand\r\nwas a much surer test than the face, both as to flesh, colour,\r\ncirculation, &c., &c. It is true that there are _some_ diseases which\r\nare only betrayed at all by something in the face, e.g., the eye or\r\nthe tongue, as great irritability of brain by the appearance of the\r\npupil of the eye. But we are talking of casual, not minute, observation.\r\nAnd few minute observers will hesitate to say that far more untruth than\r\ntruth is conveyed by the oft repeated words, He _looks_ well, or ill, or\r\nbetter or worse.\r\n\r\nWonderful is the way in which people will go upon the slightest\r\nobservation, or often upon no observation at all, or upon some _saw_\r\nwhich the world's experience, if it had any, would have pronounced\r\nutterly false long ago.\r\n\r\nI have known patients dying of sheer pain, exhaustion, and want of\r\nsleep, from one of the most lingering and painful diseases known,\r\npreserve, till within a few days of death, not only the healthy colour\r\nof the cheek, but the mottled appearance of a robust child. And scores\r\nof times have I heard these unfortunate creatures assailed with, \"I am\r\nglad to see you looking so well.\" \"I see no reason why you should not\r\nlive till ninety years of age.\" \"Why don't you take a little more\r\nexercise and amusement?\" with all the other commonplaces with which we\r\nare so familiar.\r\n\r\nThere is, unquestionably, a physiognomy of disease. Let the nurse learn\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe experienced nurse can always tell that a person has taken a narcotic\r\nthe night before by the patchiness of the colour about the face, when\r\nthe re-action of depression has set in; that very colour which the\r\ninexperienced will point to as a proof of health.\r\n\r\nThere is, again, a faintness, which does not betray itself by the colour\r\nat all, or in which the patient becomes brown instead of white. There is\r\na faintness of another kind which, it is true, can always be seen by the\r\npaleness.\r\n\r\nBut the nurse seldom distinguishes. She will talk to the patient who is\r\ntoo faint to move, without the least scruple, unless he is pale and\r\nunless, luckily for him, the muscles of the throat are affected and he\r\nloses his voice.\r\n\r\nYet these two faintnesses are perfectly distinguishable, by the mere\r\ncountenance of the patient.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Peculiarities of patients.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the nurse must distinguish between the idiosyncracies of\r\npatients. One likes to suffer out all his suffering alone, to be as\r\nlittle looked after as possible. Another likes to be perpetually made\r\nmuch of and pitied, and to have some one always by him. Both these\r\npeculiarities might be observed and indulged much more than they are.\r\nFor quite as often does it happen that a busy attendance is forced upon\r\nthe first patient, who wishes for nothing but to be \"let alone,\" as that\r\nthe second is left to think himself neglected.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nurse must observe for herself increase of patient's\r\nweakness, patient will not tell her.]\r\n\r\nAgain, I think that few things press so heavily on one suffering from\r\nlong and incurable illness, as the necessity of recording in words from\r\ntime to time, for the information of the nurse, who will not otherwise\r\nsee, that he cannot do this or that, which he could do a month or a year\r\nago. What is a nurse there for if she cannot observe these things for\r\nherself? Yet I have known--and known too among those--and _chiefly_\r\namong those--whom money and position put in possession of everything\r\nwhich money and position could give--I have known, I say, more\r\naccidents, (fatal, slowly or rapidly,) arising from this want of\r\nobservation among nurses than from almost anything else. Because a\r\npatient could get out of a warm-bath alone a month ago--because a\r\npatient could walk as far as his bell a week ago, the nurse concludes\r\nthat he can do so now. She has never observed the change; and the\r\npatient is lost from being left in a helpless state of exhaustion, till\r\nsome one accidentally comes in. And this not from any unexpected\r\napoplectic, paralytic, or fainting fit (though even these could be\r\nexpected far more, at least, than they are now, if we did but\r\n_observe_). No, from the expected, or to be expected, inevitable,\r\nvisible, calculable, uninterrupted increase of weakness, which none need\r\nfail to observe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Accidents arising from the nurse's want of observation.]\r\n\r\nAgain, a patient not usually confined to bed, is compelled by an attack\r\nof diarrhoea, vomiting, or other accident, to keep his bed for a few\r\ndays; he gets up for the first time, and the nurse lets him go into\r\nanother room, without coming in, a few minutes afterwards, to look after\r\nhim. It never occurs to her that he is quite certain to be faint, or\r\ncold, or to want something. She says, as her excuse, Oh, he does not\r\nlike to be fidgetted after. Yes, he said so some weeks ago; but he never\r\nsaid he did not like to be \"fidgetted after,\" when he is in the state he\r\nis in now; and if he did, you ought to make some excuse to go in to him.\r\nMore patients have been lost in this way than is at all generally known,\r\nviz., from relapses brought on by being left for an hour or two faint,\r\nor cold, or hungry, after getting up for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is the faculty of observing on the decline.]\r\n\r\nYet it appears that scarcely any improvement in the faculty of observing\r\nis being made. Vast has been the increase of knowledge in\r\npathology--that science which teaches us the final change produced by\r\ndisease on the human frame--scarce any in the art of observing the signs\r\nof the change while in progress. Or, rather, is it not to be feared that\r\nobservation, as an essential part of medicine, has been declining?\r\n\r\nWhich of us has not heard fifty times, from one or another, a nurse, or\r\na friend of the sick, aye, and a medical friend too, the following\r\nremark:--\"So A is worse, or B is dead. I saw him the day before; I\r\nthought him so much better; there certainly was no appearance from which\r\none could have expected so sudden (?) a change.\" I have never heard any\r\none say, though one would think it the more natural thing, \"There _must_\r\nhave been _some_ appearance, which I should have seen if I had but\r\nlooked; let me try and remember what there was, that I may observe\r\nanother time.\" No, this is not what people say. They boldly assert that\r\nthere was nothing to observe, not that their observation was at fault.\r\n\r\nLet people who have to observe sickness and death look back and try to\r\nregister in their observation the appearances which have preceded\r\nrelapse, attack, or death, and not assert that there were none, or that\r\nthere were not the _right_ ones.[37]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observation of general conditions.]\r\n\r\nA want of the habit of observing conditions and an inveterate habit of\r\ntaking averages are each of them often equally misleading.\r\n\r\nMen whose profession like that of medical men leads them to observe\r\nonly, or chiefly, palpable and permanent organic changes are often just\r\nas wrong in their opinion of the result as those who do not observe at\r\nall. For instance, there is a broken leg; the surgeon has only to look\r\nat it once to know; it will not be different if he sees it in the\r\nmorning to what it would have been had he seen it in the evening. And in\r\nwhatever conditions the patient is, or is likely to be, there will still\r\nbe the broken leg, until it is set. The same with many organic diseases.\r\nAn experienced physician has but to feel the pulse once, and he knows\r\nthat there is aneurism which will kill some time or other.\r\n\r\nBut with the great majority of cases, there is nothing of the kind; and\r\nthe power of forming any correct opinion as to the result must entirely\r\ndepend upon an enquiry into all the conditions in which the patient\r\nlives. In a complicated state of society in large towns, death, as every\r\none of great experience knows, is far less often produced by any one\r\norganic disease than by some illness, after many other diseases,\r\nproducing just the sum of exhaustion necessary for death. There is\r\nnothing so absurd, nothing so misleading as the verdict one so often\r\nhears: So-and-so has no organic disease,--there is no reason why he\r\nshould not live to extreme old age; sometimes the clause is added,\r\nsometimes not: Provided he has quiet, good food, good air, &c., &c.,\r\n&c.; the verdict is repeated by ignorant people _without_ the latter\r\nclause; or there is no possibility of the conditions of the latter\r\nclause being obtained; and this, the _only_ essential part of the whole,\r\nis made of no effect. I have heard a physician, deservedly eminent,\r\nassure the friends of a patient of his recovery. Why? Because he had now\r\nprescribed a course, every detail of which the patient had followed for\r\nyears. And because he had forbidden a course which the patient could not\r\nby any possibility alter.[38]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly a person of no scientific knowledge whatever but of\r\nobservation and experience in these kinds of conditions, will be able to\r\narrive at a much truer guess as to the probable duration of life of\r\nmembers of a family or inmates of a house, than the most scientific\r\nphysician to whom the same persons are brought to have their pulse felt;\r\nno enquiry being made into their conditions.\r\n\r\nIn Life Insurance and such like societies, were they instead of having\r\nthe persons examined by a medical man, to have the houses, conditions,\r\nways of life, of these persons examined, at how much truer results would\r\nthey arrive! W. Smith appears a fine hale man, but it might be known\r\nthat the next cholera epidemic he runs a bad chance. Mr. and Mrs. J. are\r\na strong healthy couple, but it might be known that they live in such a\r\nhouse, in such a part of London, so near the river that they will kill\r\nfour-fifths of their children; which of the children will be the ones to\r\nsurvive might also be known.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Average rate of mortality\" tells us only that so many per\r\ncent. will die. Observation must tell us _which_ in the hundred they\r\nwill be who will die.]\r\n\r\nAverages again seduce us away from minute observation. \"Average\r\nmortalities\" merely tell that so many per cent. die in this town and so\r\nmany in that, per annum. But whether A or B will be among these, the\r\n\"average rate\" of course does not tell. We know, say, that from 22 to 24\r\nper 1,000 will die in London next year. But minute enquiries into\r\nconditions enable us to know that in such a district, nay, in such a\r\nstreet,--or even on one side of that street, in such a particular house,\r\nor even on one floor of that particular house, will be the excess of\r\nmortality, that is, the person will die who ought not to have died\r\nbefore old age.\r\n\r\nNow, would it not very materially alter the opinion of whoever were\r\nendeavouring to form one, if he knew that from that floor, of that\r\nhouse, of that street the man came?\r\n\r\nMuch more precise might be our observations even than this and much more\r\ncorrect our conclusions.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the same names may be seen constantly recurring on\r\nworkhouse books for generations. That is, the persons were born and\r\nbrought up, and will be born and brought up, generation after\r\ngeneration, in the conditions which make paupers. Death and disease are\r\nlike the workhouse, they take from the same family, the same house, or\r\nin other words the same conditions. Why will we not observe what they\r\nare?\r\n\r\nThe close observer may safely predict that such a family, whether its\r\nmembers marry or not, will become extinct; that such another will\r\ndegenerate morally and physically. But who learns the lesson? On the\r\ncontrary, it may be well known that the children die in such a house at\r\nthe rate of 8 out of 10; one would think that nothing more need be said;\r\nfor how could Providence speak more distinctly? yet nobody listens, the\r\nfamily goes on living there till it dies out, and then some other family\r\ntakes it. Neither would they listen \"if one rose from the dead.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What observation is for.]\r\n\r\nIn dwelling upon the vital importance of _sound_ observation, it must\r\nnever be lost sight of what observation is for. It is not for the sake\r\nof piling up miscellaneous information or curious facts, but for the\r\nsake of saving life and increasing health and comfort. The caution may\r\nseem useless, but it is quite surprising how many men (some women do it\r\ntoo), practically behave as if the scientific end were the only one in\r\nview, or as if the sick body were but a reservoir for stowing medicines\r\ninto, and the surgical disease only a curious case the sufferer has made\r\nfor the attendant's special information. This is really no exaggeration.\r\nYou think, if you suspected your patient was being poisoned, say, by a\r\ncopper kettle, you would instantly, as you ought, cut off all possible\r\nconnection between him and the suspected source of injury, without\r\nregard to the fact that a curious mine of observation is thereby lost.\r\nBut it is not everybody who does so, and it has actually been made a\r\nquestion of medical ethics, what should the medical man do if he\r\nsuspected poisoning? The answer seems a very simple one,--insist on a\r\nconfidential nurse being placed with the patient, or give up the case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What a confidential nurse should be.]\r\n\r\nAnd remember every nurse should be one who is to be depended upon, in\r\nother words, capable of being a \"confidential\" nurse. She does not know\r\nhow soon she may find herself placed in such a situation; she must be no\r\ngossip, no vain talker; she should never answer questions about her sick\r\nexcept to those who have a right to ask them; she must, I need not say,\r\nbe strictly sober and honest; but more than this, she must be a\r\nreligious and devoted woman; she must have a respect for her own\r\ncalling, because God's precious gift of life is often literally placed\r\nin her hands; she must be a sound, and close, and quick observer; and\r\nshe must be a woman of delicate and decent feeling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Observation is for practical purposes.]\r\n\r\nTo return to the question of what observation is for:--It would really\r\nseem as if some had considered it as its own end, as if detection, not\r\ncure, was their business; nay more, in a recent celebrated trial, three\r\nmedical men, according to their own account, suspected poison,\r\nprescribed for dysentery, and left the patient to the poisoner. This is\r\nan extreme case. But in a small way, the same manner of acting falls\r\nunder the cognizance of us all. How often the attendants of a case have\r\nstated that they knew perfectly well that the patient could not get well\r\nin such an air, in such a room, or under such circumstances, yet have\r\ngone on dosing him with medicine, and making no effort to remove the\r\npoison from him, or him from the poison which they knew was killing him;\r\nnay, more, have sometimes not so much as mentioned their conviction in\r\nthe right quarter--that is, to the only person who could act in the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sanitary nursing as essential in surgical as in medical\r\ncases, but not to supersede surgical nursing.]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the preceding remarks apply even more to children and to\r\npuerperal women than to patients in general. They also apply to the\r\nnursing of surgical, quite as much as to that of medical cases. Indeed,\r\nif it be possible, cases of external injury require such care even more\r\nthan sick. In surgical wards, one duty of every nurse certainly is\r\n_prevention_. Fever, or hospital gangrene, or pyæmia, or purulent\r\ndischarge of some kind may else supervene. Has she a case of compound\r\nfracture, of amputation, or of erysipelas, it may depend very much on\r\nhow she looks upon the things enumerated in these notes, whether one or\r\nother of these hospital diseases attacks her patient or not. If she\r\nallows her ward to become filled with the peculiar close foetid smell, so\r\napt to be produced among surgical cases, especially where there is great\r\nsuppuration and discharge, she may see a vigorous patient in the prime\r\nof life gradually sink and die where, according to all human\r\nprobability, he ought to have recovered. The surgical nurse must be ever\r\non the watch, ever on her guard, against want of cleanliness, foul air,\r\nwant of light, and of warmth.\r\n\r\nNevertheless let no one think that because _sanitary_ nursing is the\r\nsubject of these notes, therefore, what may be called the handicraft of\r\nnursing is to be undervalued. A patient may be left to bleed to death in\r\na sanitary palace. Another who cannot move himself may die of bed-sores,\r\nbecause the nurse does not know how to change and clean him, while he\r\nhas every requisite of air, light, and quiet. But nursing, as a\r\nhandicraft, has not been treated of here for three reasons: 1. that\r\nthese notes do not pretend to be a manual for nursing, any more than for\r\ncooking for the sick; 2. that the writer, who has herself seen more of\r\nwhat may be called surgical nursing, i.e., practical manual nursing,\r\nthan, perhaps, any one in Europe, honestly believes that it is\r\nimpossible to learn it from any book, and that it can only be thoroughly\r\nlearnt in the wards of a hospital; and she also honestly believes that\r\nthe perfection of surgical nursing may be seen practised by the\r\nold-fashioned \"Sister\" of a London hospital, as it can be seen nowhere\r\nelse in Europe. 3. While thousands die of foul air, &c., who have this\r\nsurgical nursing to perfection, the converse is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Children: their greater susceptibility to the same things.]\r\n\r\nTo revert to children. They are much more susceptible than grown people\r\nto all noxious influences. They are affected by the same things, but\r\nmuch more quickly and seriously, viz., by want of fresh air, of proper\r\nwarmth, want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body, by\r\nstartling noises, improper food, or want of punctuality, by dulness and\r\nby want of light, by too much or too little covering in bed, or when up,\r\nby want of the spirit of management generally in those in charge of\r\nthem. One can, therefore, only press the importance, as being yet\r\ngreater in the case of children, greatest in the case of sick children,\r\nof attending to these things.\r\n\r\nThat which, however, above all, is known to injure children seriously is\r\nfoul air, and most seriously at night. Keeping the rooms where they\r\nsleep tight shut up, is destruction to them. And, if the child's\r\nbreathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such foul air\r\nmay endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is felt by grown-up\r\npersons in the same room.\r\n\r\nThe following passages, taken out of an excellent \"Lecture on Sudden\r\nDeath in Infancy and Childhood,\" just published, show the vital\r\nimportance of careful nursing of children. \"In the great majority of\r\ninstances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young child, it is\r\nan _accident_; it is not a necessary, inevitable result of any disease\r\nfrom which it is suffering.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be here added, that it would be very desirable to know how often\r\ndeath is, with adults, \"not a necessary, inevitable result of any\r\ndisease.\" Omit the word \"sudden;\" (for _sudden_ death is comparatively\r\nrare in middle age;) and the sentence is almost equally true for all\r\nages.\r\n\r\nThe following causes of \"accidental\" death in sick children are\r\nenumerated:--\"Sudden noises, which startle--a rapid change of\r\ntemperature, which chills the surface, though only for a moment--a rude\r\nawakening from sleep--or even an over-hasty, or an over-full meal\"--\"any\r\nsudden impression on the nervous system--any hasty alteration of\r\nposture--in short, any cause whatever by which the respiratory process\r\nmay be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nIt may again be added, that, with very weak adult patients, these causes\r\nare also (not often \"suddenly fatal,\" it is true, but) very much oftener\r\nthan is at all generally known, irreparable in their consequences.\r\n\r\nBoth for children and for adults, both for sick and for well (although\r\nmore certainly in the case of sick children than in any others), I would\r\nhere again repeat, the most frequent and most fatal cause of all is\r\nsleeping, for even a few hours, much more for weeks and months, in foul\r\nair, a condition which, more than any other condition, disturbs the\r\nrespiratory process, and tends to produce \"accidental\" death in disease.\r\n\r\nI need hardly here repeat the warning against any confusion of ideas\r\nbetween cold and fresh air. You may chill a patient fatally without\r\ngiving him fresh air at all. And you can quite well, nay, much better,\r\ngive him fresh air without chilling him. This is the test of a good\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\nIn cases of long recurring faintnesses from disease, for instance,\r\nespecially disease which affects the organs of breathing, fresh air to\r\nthe lungs, warmth to the surface, and often (as soon as the patient can\r\nswallow) hot drink, these are the right remedies and the only ones. Yet,\r\noftener than not, you see the nurse or mother just reversing this;\r\nshutting up every cranny through which fresh air can enter, and leaving\r\nthe body cold, or perhaps throwing a greater weight of clothes upon it,\r\nwhen already it is generating too little heat.\r\n\r\n\"Breathing carefully, anxiously, as though respiration were a function\r\nwhich required all the attention for its performance,\" is cited as a not\r\nunusual state in children, and as one calling for care in all the things\r\nenumerated above. That breathing becomes an almost voluntary act, even\r\nin grown up patients who are very weak, must often have been remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Disease having interfered with the perfect accomplishment of the\r\nrespiratory function, some sudden demand for its complete exercise,\r\nissues in the sudden standstill of the whole machinery,\" is given as\r\none process:--\"life goes out for want of nervous power to keep the vital\r\nfunctions in activity,\" is given as another, by which \"accidental\" death\r\nis most often brought to pass in infancy.\r\n\r\nAlso in middle age, both these processes may be seen ending in death,\r\nalthough generally not suddenly. And I have seen, even in middle age,\r\nthe \"_sudden_ stand-still\" here mentioned, and from the same causes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up:--the answer to two of the commonest objections urged, one by\r\nwomen themselves, the other by men, against the desirableness of\r\nsanitary knowledge for women, _plus_ a caution, comprises the whole\r\nargument for the art of nursing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reckless amateur physicking by women. Real knowledge of the\r\nlaws of health alone can check this.]\r\n\r\n(1.) It is often said by men, that it is unwise to teach women anything\r\nabout these laws of health, because they will take to physicking,--that\r\nthere is a great deal too much of amateur physicking as it is, which is\r\nindeed true. One eminent physician told me that he had known more\r\ncalomel given, both at a pinch and for a continuance, by mothers,\r\ngovernesses, and nurses, to children than he had ever heard of a\r\nphysician prescribing in all his experience. Another says, that women's\r\nonly idea in medicine is calomel and aperients. This is undeniably too\r\noften the case. There is nothing ever seen in any professional practice\r\nlike the reckless physicking by amateur females.[39] But this is just\r\nwhat the really experienced and observing nurse does _not_ do; she\r\nneither physics herself nor others. And to cultivate in things\r\npertaining to health observation and experience in women who are\r\nmothers, governesses or nurses, is just the way to do away with amateur\r\nphysicking, and if the doctors did but know it, to make the nurses\r\nobedient to them,--helps to them instead of hindrances. Such education\r\nin women would indeed diminish the doctor's work--but no one really\r\nbelieves that doctors wish that there should be more illness, in order\r\nto have more work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What pathology teaches. What observation alone teaches. What\r\nmedicine does. What nature alone does.]\r\n\r\n(2.) It is often said by women, that they cannot know anything of the\r\nlaws of health, or what to do to preserve their children's health,\r\nbecause they can know nothing of \"Pathology,\" or cannot \"dissect,\"--a\r\nconfusion of ideas which it is hard to attempt to disentangle. Pathology\r\nteaches the harm that disease has done. But it teaches nothing more. We\r\nknow nothing of the principle of health, the positive of which pathology\r\nis the negative, except from observation and experience. And nothing but\r\nobservation and experience will teach us the ways to maintain or to\r\nbring back the state of health. It is often thought that medicine is the\r\ncurative process. It is no such thing; medicine is the surgery of\r\nfunctions, as surgery proper is that of limbs and organs. Neither can do\r\nanything but remove obstructions; neither can cure; nature alone cures.\r\nSurgery removes the bullet out of the limb, which is an obstruction to\r\ncure, but nature heals the wound. So it is with medicine; the function\r\nof an organ becomes obstructed; medicine, so far as we know, assists\r\nnature to remove the obstruction, but does nothing more. And what\r\nnursing has to do in either case, is to put the patient in the best\r\ncondition for nature to act upon him. Generally, just the contrary is\r\ndone. You think fresh air, and quiet and cleanliness extravagant,\r\nperhaps dangerous, luxuries, which should be given to the patient only\r\nwhen quite convenient, and medicine the _sine quâ non_, the panacea. If\r\nI have succeeded in any measure in dispelling this illusion, and in\r\nshowing what true nursing is, and what it is not, my object will have\r\nbeen answered.\r\n\r\nNow for the caution:--\r\n\r\n(3.) It seems a commonly received idea among men and even among women\r\nthemselves that it requires nothing but a disappointment in love, the\r\nwant of an object, a general disgust, or incapacity for other things, to\r\nturn a woman into a good nurse.\r\n\r\nThis reminds one of the parish where a stupid old man was set to be\r\nschoolmaster because he was \"past keeping the pigs.\"\r\n\r\nApply the above receipt for making a good nurse to making a good\r\nservant. And the receipt will be found to fail.\r\n\r\nYet popular novelists of recent days have invented ladies disappointed\r\nin love or fresh out of the drawing-room turning into the war-hospitals\r\nto find their wounded lovers, and when found, forthwith abandoning their\r\nsick-ward for their lover, as might be expected. Yet in the estimation\r\nof the authors, these ladies were none the worse for that, but on the\r\ncontrary were heroines of nursing.\r\n\r\nWhat cruel mistakes are sometimes made by benevolent men and women in\r\nmatters of business about which they can know nothing and think they\r\nknow a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe everyday management of a large ward, let alone of a hospital--the\r\nknowing what are the laws of life and death for men, and what the laws\r\nof health for wards--(and wards are healthy or unhealthy, mainly\r\naccording to the knowledge or ignorance of the nurse)--are not these\r\nmatters of sufficient importance and difficulty to require learning by\r\nexperience and careful inquiry, just as much as any other art? They do\r\nnot come by inspiration to the lady disappointed in love, nor to the\r\npoor workhouse drudge hard up for a livelihood.\r\n\r\nAnd terrible is the injury which has followed to the sick from such wild\r\nnotions!\r\n\r\nIn this respect (and why is it so?), in Roman Catholic countries, both\r\nwriters and workers are, in theory at least, far before ours. They would\r\nnever think of such a beginning for a good working Superior or Sister of\r\nCharity. And many a Superior has refused to admit a _Postulant_ who\r\nappeared to have no better \"vocation\" or reasons for offering herself\r\nthan these.\r\n\r\nIt is true _we_ make \"no vows.\" But is a \"vow\" necessary to convince us\r\nthat the true spirit for learning any art, most especially an art of\r\ncharity, aright, is not a disgust to everything or something else? Do\r\nwe really place the love of our kind (and of nursing, as one branch of\r\nit,) so low as this? What would the Mère Angélique of Port Royal, what\r\nwould our own Mrs. Fry have said to this?\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--I would earnestly ask my sisters to keep clear of both the\r\n    jargons now current everywhere (for they _are_ equally jargons); of\r\n    the jargon, namely, about the \"rights\" of women, which urges women\r\n    to do all that men do, including the medical and other professions,\r\n    merely because men do it, and without regard to whether this _is_\r\n    the best that women can do; and of the jargon which urges women to\r\n    do nothing that men do, merely because they are women, and should be\r\n    \"recalled to a sense of their duty as women,\" and because \"this is\r\n    women's work,\" and \"that is men's,\" and \"these are things which\r\n    women should not do,\" which is all assertion and nothing more.\r\n    Surely woman should bring the best she has, _whatever_ that is, to\r\n    the work of God's world, without attending to either of these cries.\r\n    For what are they, both of them, the one _just_ as much as the\r\n    other, but listening to the \"what people will say,\" to opinion, to\r\n    the \"voices from without?\" And as a wise man has said, no one has\r\n    ever done anything great or useful by listening to the voices from\r\n    without.\r\n\r\n    You do not want the effect of your good things to be, \"How\r\n    wonderful for a _woman!_\" nor would you be deterred from good\r\n    things, by hearing it said, \"Yes, but she ought not to have done\r\n    this, because it is not suitable for a woman.\" But you want to do\r\n    the thing that is good, whether it is \"suitable for a woman\" or\r\n    not.\r\n\r\n    It does not make a thing good, that it is remarkable that a woman\r\n    should have been able to do it. Neither does it make a thing bad,\r\n    which would have been good had a man done it, that it has been done\r\n    by a woman.\r\n\r\n    Oh, leave these jargons, and go your way straight to God's work, in\r\n    simplicity and singleness of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: The tables below have been rotated through 90 for\r\neasier display.]\r\n\r\nTABLE A.\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   |     Nurse     |   Nurse   |\r\nNURSES.            | (not Domestic | (Domestic |\r\n                   |    Servant)   |  Servant) |\r\n-------------------+---------------+-----------+\r\nAll Ages           |   25,466      |  39,139   |\r\nUnder 5 Years.     |      ...      |    ...    |\r\n    5-             |      ...      |     508   |\r\n   10-             |      ...      |   7,259   |\r\n   15-             |      ...      |  10,355   |\r\n   20-             |      624      |   6,537   |\r\n   25-             |      817      |   4,174   |\r\n   30-             |    1,118      |   2,495   |\r\n   35-             |    1,359      |   1,681   |\r\n   40-             |    2,223      |   1,468   |\r\n   45-             |    2,748      |   1,206   |\r\n   50-             |    3,982      |   1,196   |\r\n   55-             |    3,456      |     833   |\r\n   60-             |    3,825      |     712   |\r\n   65-             |    2,542      |     369   |\r\n   70-             |    1,568      |     204   |\r\n   75-             |      746      |     101   |\r\n   80-             |      311      |      25   |\r\n   85 and Upwards  |      147      |      16   |\r\n-------------------+---------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE B.\r\n\r\nAGED 20 YEARS OF AGE, AND UPWARDS.\r\n\r\n                                               |Nurse         |Nurse      |\r\n                                               |(not Domestic |(Domestic  |\r\n                                               |Servant)      |Servant)   |\r\n-----------------------------------------------+--------------+-----------+\r\nGreat Britain and Islands in the British Seas. |    25,466    |   21,017  |\r\nEngland and Wales.                             |    23,751    |   18,945  |\r\nScotland.                                      |     1,543    |    1,922  |\r\nIslands in the British Seas.                   |       172    |      150  |\r\n1st Division.

The numbers\r\nof different ages are shown in table A, and in table B their\r\ndistribution over Great Britain.\r\n\r\nTo increase the efficiency of this class, and to make as many of them as\r\npossible the disciples of the true doctrines of health, would be a great\r\nnational work.\r\n\r\nFor there the material exists, and will be used for nursing, whether the\r\nreal \"conclusion of the matter\" be to nurse or to poison the sick. A\r\nman, who stands perhaps at the head of our medical profession, once said\r\nto me, I send a nurse into a private family to nurse the sick, but I\r\nknow that it is only to do them harm.\r\n\r\nNow a nurse means any person in charge of the personal health of\r\nanother. And, in the preceding notes, the term _nurse_ is used\r\nindiscriminately for amateur and professional nurses. For, besides\r\nnurses of the sick and nurses of children, the numbers of whom are here\r\ngiven, there are friends or relations who take temporary charge of a\r\nsick person, there are mothers of families. It appears as if these\r\nunprofessional nurses were just as much in want of knowledge of the laws\r\nof health as professional ones.\r\n\r\nThen there are the school-mistresses of all national and other schools\r\nthroughout the kingdom. How many of children's epidemics originate in\r\nthese! Then the proportion of girls in these schools, who become mothers\r\nor members among the 64,600 nurses recorded above, or schoolmistresses\r\nin their turn. If the laws of health, as far as regards fresh air,\r\ncleanliness, light, &c., were taught to these, would this not prevent\r\nsome children being killed, some evil being perpetuated? On women we\r\nmust depend, first and last, for personal and household hygiene--for\r\npreventing the race from degenerating in as far as these things are\r\nconcerned. Would not the true way of infusing the art of preserving its\r\nown health into the human race be to teach the female part of it in\r\nschools and hospitals, both by practical teaching and by simple\r\nexperiments, in as far as these illustrate what may be called the theory\r\nof it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Curious deductions from an excessive death rate.]\r\n\r\nUpon this fact the most wonderful deductions have been strung. For a\r\nlong time an announcement something like the following has been going\r\nthe round of the papers:--\"More than 25,000 children die every year in\r\nLondon under 10 years of age; therefore we want a Children's Hospital.\"\r\nThis spring there was a prospectus issued, and divers other means taken\r\nto this effect:--\"There is a great want of sanitary knowledge in women;\r\ntherefore we want a Women's Hospital.\" Now, both the above facts are too\r\nsadly true. But what is the deduction? The causes of the enormous child\r\nmortality are perfectly well known; they are chiefly want of\r\ncleanliness, want of ventilation, want of white-washing; in one word,\r\ndefective _household_ hygiene. The remedies are just as well known; and\r\namong them is certainly not the establishment of a Child's Hospital.\r\nThis may be a want; just as there may be a want of hospital room for\r\nadults. But the Registrar-General would certainly never think of giving\r\nus as a cause for the high rate of child mortality in (say) Liverpool\r\nthat there was not sufficient hospital room for children; nor would he\r\nurge upon us, as a remedy, to found a hospital for them.\r\n\r\nAgain, women, and the best women, are wofully deficient in sanitary\r\nknowledge; although it is to women that we must look, first and last,\r\nfor its application, as far as _household_ hygiene is concerned. But who\r\nwould ever think of citing the institution of a Women's Hospital as the\r\nway to cure this want?\r\n\r\nWe have it, indeed, upon very high authority that there is some fear\r\nlest hospitals, as they have been _hitherto_, may not have generally\r\nincreased, rather than diminished, the rate of mortality--especially of\r\nchild mortality.\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why are uninhabited rooms shut up?]\r\n\r\nThe common idea as to uninhabited rooms is, that they may safely be left\r\nwith doors, windows, shutters, and chimney board, all\r\nclosed--hermetically sealed if possible--to keep out the dust, it is\r\nsaid; and that no harm will happen if the room is but opened a short\r\nhour before the inmates are put in. I have often been asked the question\r\nfor uninhabited rooms--But when ought the windows to be opened? The\r\nanswer is--When ought they to be shut?\r\n\r\n[3] It is very desirable that the windows in a sick room should be such\r\nas that the patient shall, if he can move about, be able to open and\r\nshut them easily himself. In fact the sick room is very seldom kept\r\naired if this is not the case--so very few people have any perception of\r\nwhat is a healthy atmosphere for the sick. The sick man often says,\r\n\"This room where I spend 22 hours out of the 24 is fresher than the\r\nother where I only spend 2. Because here I can manage the windows\r\nmyself.\" And [Transcriber's Note: Word, possibly \"it\" missing in\r\noriginal.] is true.\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An air-test of essential consequence.]\r\n\r\nDr. Angus Smith's air test, if it could be made of simpler application,\r\nwould be invaluable to use in every sleeping and sick room. Just as\r\nwithout the use of a thermometer no nurse should ever put a patient into\r\na bath, so should no nurse, or mother, or superintendent be without the\r\nair test in any ward, nursery, or sleeping-room. If the main function of\r\na nurse is to maintain the air within the room as fresh as the air\r\nwithout, without lowering the temperature, then she should always be\r\nprovided with a thermometer which indicates the temperature, with an air\r\ntest which indicates the organic matter of the air. But to be used, the\r\nlatter must be made as simple a little instrument as the former, and\r\nboth should be self-registering. The senses of nurses and mothers become\r\nso dulled to foul air that they are perfectly unconscious of what an\r\natmosphere they have let their children, patients, or charges, sleep in.\r\nBut if the tell-tale air-test were to exhibit in the morning, both to\r\nnurses and patients and to the superior officer going round, what the\r\natmosphere has been during the night, I question if any greater security\r\ncould be afforded against a recurrence of the misdemeanour.\r\n\r\nAnd oh; the crowded national school! where so many children's epidemics\r\nhave their origin, what a tale its air-test would tell! We should have\r\nparents saying, and saying rightly, \"I will not send my child to that\r\nschool, the air-test stands at 'Horrid.'\" And the dormitories of our\r\ngreat boarding schools! Scarlet fever would be no more ascribed to\r\ncontagion, but to its right cause, the air-test standing at \"Foul.\"\r\n\r\nWe should hear no longer of \"Mysterious Dispensations,\" and of \"Plague\r\nand Pestilence,\" being \"in God's hands,\" when, so far as we know, He has\r\nput them into our own. The little air-test would both betray the cause\r\nof these \"mysterious pestilences,\" and call upon us to remedy it.\r\n\r\n[5] With private sick, I think, but certainly with hospital sick, the\r\nnurse should never be satisfied as to the freshness of their atmosphere,\r\nunless she can feel the air gently moving over her face, when still.\r\n\r\nBut it is often observed that nurses who make the greatest outcry\r\nagainst open windows are those who take the least pains to prevent\r\ndangerous draughts. The door of the patients' room or ward _must_\r\nsometimes stand open to allow of persons passing in and out, or heavy\r\nthings being carried in and out. The careful nurse will keep the door\r\nshut while she shuts the windows, and then, and not before, set the door\r\nopen, so that a patient may not be left sitting up in bed, perhaps in a\r\nprofuse perspiration, directly in the draught between the open door and\r\nwindow. Neither, of course, should a patient, while being washed or in\r\nany way exposed, remain in the draught of an open window or door.\r\n\r\n[6]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Don't make your sick-room into a sewer.]\r\n\r\nBut never, never should the possession of this indispensable lid confirm\r\nyou in the abominable practice of letting the chamber utensil remain in\r\na patient's room unemptied, except once in the 24 hours, i.e., when\r\nthe bed is made. Yes, impossible as it may appear, I have known the best\r\nand most attentive nurses guilty of this; aye, and have known, too, a\r\npatient afflicted with severe diarrhoea for ten days, and the nurse (a\r\nvery good one) not know of it, because the chamber utensil (one with a\r\nlid) was emptied only once in the 24 hours, and that by the housemaid\r\nwho came in and made the patient's bed every evening. As well might you\r\nhave a sewer under the room, or think that in a water closet the plug\r\nneed be pulled up but once a day. Also take care that your _lid_, as\r\nwell as your utensil, be always thoroughly rinsed.\r\n\r\nIf a nurse declines to do these kinds of things for her patient,\r\n\"because it is not her business,\" I should say that nursing was not her\r\ncalling. I have seen surgical \"sisters,\" women whose hands were worth to\r\nthem two or three guineas a-week, down upon their knees scouring a room\r\nor hut, because they thought it otherwise not fit for their patients to\r\ngo into. I am far from wishing nurses to scour. It is a waste of power.\r\nBut I do say that these women had the true nurse-calling--the good of\r\ntheir sick first, and second only the consideration what it was their\r\n\"place\" to do--and that women who wait for the housemaid to do this, or\r\nfor the charwoman to do that, when their patients are suffering, have\r\nnot the _making_ of a nurse in them.\r\n\r\n[7]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Health of carriages.]\r\n\r\nThe health of carriages, especially close carriages, is not of\r\nsufficient universal importance to mention here, otherwise than\r\ncursorily. Children, who are always the most delicate test of sanitary\r\nconditions, generally cannot enter a close carriage without being\r\nsick--and very lucky for them that it is so. A close carriage, with the\r\nhorse-hair cushions and linings always saturated with organic matter, if\r\nto this be added the windows up, is one of the most unhealthy of human\r\nreceptacles. The idea of taking an _airing_ in it is something\r\npreposterous. Dr. Angus Smith has shown that a crowded railway carriage,\r\nwhich goes at the rate of 30 miles an hour, is as unwholesome as the\r\nstrong smell of a sewer, or as a back yard in one of the most unhealthy\r\ncourts off one of the most unhealthy streets in Manchester.\r\n\r\n[8] God lays down certain physical laws. Upon His carrying out such laws\r\ndepends our responsibility (that much abused word), for how could we\r\nhave any responsibility for actions, the results of which we could not\r\nforesee--which would be the case if the carrying out of His laws were\r\n_not_ certain. Yet we seem to be continually expecting that He will work\r\na miracle--i.e. break His own laws expressly to relieve us of\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\n[9]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Servants' rooms.]\r\n\r\nI must say a word about servants' bed-rooms. From the way they are\r\nbuilt, but oftener from the way they are kept, and from no intelligent\r\ninspection whatever being exercised over them, they are almost\r\ninvariably dens of foul air, and the \"servants' health\" suffers in an\r\n\"unaccountable\" (?) way, even in the country. For I am by no means\r\nspeaking only of London houses, where too often servants are put to live\r\nunder the ground and over the roof. But in a country \"_mansion_,\" which\r\nwas really a \"mansion,\" (not after the fashion of advertisements), I\r\nhave known three maids who slept in the same room ill of scarlet fever.\r\n\"How catching it is,\" was of course the remark. One look at the room,\r\none smell of the room, was quite enough. It was no longer\r\n\"unaccountable.\" The room was not a small one; it was up stairs, and it\r\nhad two large windows--but nearly every one of the neglects enumerated\r\nabove was there.\r\n\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diseases are not individuals arranged in classes, like cats\r\nand dogs, but conditions growing out of one another.]\r\n\r\nIs it not living in a continual mistake to look upon diseases, as we do\r\nnow, as separate entities, which _must_ exist, like cats and dogs?\r\ninstead of looking upon them as conditions, like a dirty and a clean\r\ncondition, and just as much under our own control; or rather as the\r\nreactions of kindly nature, against the conditions in which we have\r\nplaced ourselves.\r\n\r\nI was brought up, both by scientific men and ignorant women, distinctly\r\nto believe that small-pox, for instance, was a thing of which there was\r\nonce a first specimen in the world, which went on propagating itself, in\r\na perpetual chain of descent, just as much as that there was a first\r\ndog, (or a first pair of dogs), and that small-pox would not begin\r\nitself any more than a new dog would begin without there having been a\r\nparent dog.\r\n\r\nSince then I have seen with my eyes and smelt with my nose small-pox\r\ngrowing up in first specimens, either in close rooms or in overcrowded\r\nwards, where it could not by any possibility have been \"caught,\" but\r\nmust have begun.\r\n\r\nNay, more, I have seen diseases begin, grow up, and pass into one\r\nanother. Now, dogs do not pass into cats.\r\n\r\nI have seen, for instance, with a little overcrowding, continued fever\r\ngrow up; and with a little more, typhoid fever; and with a little more,\r\ntyphus, and all in the same ward or hut.\r\n\r\nWould it not be far better, truer, and more practical, if we looked upon\r\ndisease in this light?\r\n\r\nFor diseases, as all experience shows, are adjectives, not noun\r\nsubstantives.\r\n\r\n[11]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lingering smell of paint a want of care.]\r\n\r\nThat excellent paper, the _Builder_, mentions the lingering of the smell\r\nof paint for a month about a house as a proof of want of ventilation.\r\nCertainly--and, where there are ample windows to open, and these are\r\nnever opened to get rid of the smell of paint, it is a proof of want of\r\nmanagement in using the means of ventilation. Of course the smell will\r\nthen remain for months. Why should it go?\r\n\r\n[12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why let your patient ever be surprised?]\r\n\r\nWhy should you let your patient ever be surprised, except by thieves? I\r\ndo not know. In England, people do not come down the chimney, or through\r\nthe window, unless they are thieves. They come in by the door, and\r\nsomebody must open the door to them. The \"somebody\" charged with opening\r\nthe door is one of two, three, or at most four persons. Why cannot\r\nthese, at most, four persons be put in charge as to what is to be done\r\nwhen there is a ring at the door bell?\r\n\r\nThe sentry at a post is changed much oftener than any servant at a\r\nprivate house or institution can possibly be. But what should we think\r\nof such an excuse as this: that the enemy had entered such a post\r\nbecause A and not B had been on guard? Yet I have constantly heard such\r\nan excuse made in the private house or institution and accepted: viz.,\r\nthat such a person had been \"let in\" or _not_ \"let in,\" and such a\r\nparcel had been wrongly delivered or lost because A and not B had opened\r\nthe door!\r\n\r\n[13] There are many physical operations where _coeteris paribus_ the\r\ndanger is in a direct ratio to the time the operation lasts; and\r\n_coeteris paribus_ the operator's success will be in direct ratio to his\r\nquickness. Now there are many mental operations where exactly the same\r\nrule holds good with the sick; _coeteris paribus_ their capability of\r\nbearing such operations depends directly on the quickness, _without\r\nhurry_, with which they can be got through.\r\n\r\n[14]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Petty management better understood in institutions than in\r\nprivate houses.]\r\n\r\nSo true is this that I could mention two cases of women of very high\r\nposition, both of whom died in the same way of the consequences of a\r\nsurgical operation. And in both cases, I was told by the highest\r\nauthority that the fatal result would not have happened in a London\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What institutions are the exception?]\r\n\r\nBut, as far as regards the art of petty management in hospitals, all the\r\nmilitary hospitals I know must be excluded. Upon my own experience I\r\nstand, and I solemnly declare that I have seen or know of fatal\r\naccidents, such as suicides in _delirium tremens_, bleedings to death,\r\ndying patients dragged out of bed by drunken Medical Staff Corps men,\r\nand many other things less patent and striking, which would not have\r\nhappened in London civil hospitals nursed by women. The medical officers\r\nshould be absolved from all blame in these accidents. How can a medical\r\nofficer mount guard all day and all night over a patient (say) in\r\n_delirium tremens_? The fault lies in there being no organized system of\r\nattendance. Were a trustworthy _man_ in charge of each ward, or set of\r\nwards, not as office clerk, but as head nurse, (and head nurse the best\r\nhospital serjeant, or ward master, is not now and cannot be, from\r\ndefault of the proper regulations), the thing would not, in all\r\nprobability, have happened. But were a trustworthy _woman_ in charge of\r\nthe ward, or set of wards, the thing would not, in all certainty, have\r\nhappened. In other words, it does not happen where a trustworthy woman\r\nis really in charge. And, in these remarks, I by no means refer only to\r\nexceptional times of great emergency in war hospitals, but also, and\r\nquite as much, to the ordinary run of military hospitals at home, in\r\ntime of peace; or to a time in war when our army was actually more\r\nhealthy than at home in peace, and the pressure on our hospitals\r\nconsequently much less.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nursing in Regimental Hospitals.]\r\n\r\nIt is often said that, in regimental hospitals, patients ought to \"nurse\r\neach other,\" because the number of sick altogether being, say, but\r\nthirty, and out of these one only perhaps being seriously ill, and the\r\nother twenty-nine having little the matter with them, and nothing to do,\r\nthey should be set to nurse the one; also, that soldiers are so trained\r\nto obey, that they will be the most obedient, and therefore the best of\r\nnurses, add to which they are always kind to their comrades.\r\n\r\nNow, have those who say this, considered that, in order to obey, you\r\nmust know _how_ to obey, and that these soldiers certainly do not know\r\nhow to obey in nursing. I have seen these \"kind\" fellows (and how kind\r\nthey are no one knows so well as myself) move a comrade so that, in one\r\ncase at least, the man died in the act. I have seen the comrades'\r\n\"kindness\" produce abundance of spirits, to be drunk in secret. Let no\r\none understand by this that female nurses ought to, or could be\r\nintroduced in regimental hospitals. It would be most undesirable, even\r\nwere it not impossible. But the head nurseship of a hospital serjeant is\r\nthe more essential, the more important, the more inexperienced the\r\nnurses. Undoubtedly, a London hospital \"sister\" does sometimes set\r\nrelays of patients to watch a critical case; but, undoubtedly also,\r\nalways under her own superintendence; and she is called to whenever\r\nthere is something to be done, and she knows how to do it. The patients\r\nare not left to do it of their own unassisted genius, however \"kind\" and\r\nwilling they may be.\r\n\r\n[15]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Burning of the crinolines.]\r\n\r\nFortunate it is if her skirts do not catch fire--and if the nurse does\r\nnot give herself up a sacrifice together with her patient, to be burnt\r\nin her own petticoats. I wish the Registrar-General would tell us the\r\nexact number of deaths by burning occasioned by this absurd and hideous\r\ncustom. But if people will be stupid, let them take measures to protect\r\nthemselves from their own stupidity--measures which every chemist knows,\r\nsuch as putting alum into starch, which prevents starched articles of\r\ndress from blazing up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indecency of the crinolines.]\r\n\r\nI wish too that people who wear crinoline could see the indecency of\r\ntheir own dress as other people see it. A respectable elderly woman\r\nstooping forward, invested in crinoline, exposes quite as much of her\r\nown person to the patient lying in the room as any opera-dancer does on\r\nthe stage. But no one will ever tell her this unpleasant truth.\r\n\r\n[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Never speak to a patient in the act of moving.]\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely essential that a nurse should lay this down as a\r\npositive rule to herself, never to speak to any patient who is standing\r\nor moving, as long as she exercises so little observation as not to know\r\nwhen a patient cannot bear it. I am satisfied that many of the accidents\r\nwhich happen from feeble patients tumbling down stairs, fainting after\r\ngetting up, &c., happen solely from the nurse popping out of a door to\r\nspeak to the patient just at that moment; or from his fearing that she\r\nwill do so. And that if the patient were even left to himself, till he\r\ncan sit down, such accidents would much seldomer occur. If the nurse\r\naccompanies the patient let her not call upon him to speak. It is\r\nincredible that nurses cannot picture to themselves the strain upon the\r\nheart, the lungs, and the brain, which the act of moving is to any\r\nfeeble patient.\r\n\r\n[17]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Careless observation of the results of careless visits.]\r\n\r\nAs an old experienced nurse, I do most earnestly deprecate all such\r\ncareless words. I have known patients delirious all night, after seeing\r\na visitor who called them \"better,\" thought they \"only wanted a little\r\namusement,\" and who came again, saying, \"I hope you were not the worse\r\nfor my visit,\" neither waiting for an answer, nor even looking at the\r\ncase. No real patient will ever say, \"Yes, but I was a great deal the\r\nworse.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, either death or delirium of which, in these cases,\r\nthere is most danger to the patient. Unperceived consequences are far\r\nmore likely to ensue. _You_ will have impunity--the poor patient will\r\n_not_. That is, the patient will suffer, although neither he nor the\r\ninflictor of the injury will attribute it to its real cause. It will not\r\nbe directly traceable, except by a very careful observant nurse. The\r\npatient will often not even mention what has done him most harm.\r\n\r\n[18]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sick would rather be told a thing than have it read to\r\nthem.]\r\n\r\nSick children, if not too shy to speak, will always express this wish.\r\nThey invariably prefer a story to be _told_ to them, rather than read to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[19]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sick suffer to excess from mental as well as bodily pain.]\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of painful wonder to the sick themselves how much painful\r\nideas predominate over pleasurable ones in their impressions; they\r\nreason with themselves; they think themselves ungrateful; it is all of\r\nno use. The fact is, that these painful impressions are far better\r\ndismissed by a real laugh, if you can excite one by books or\r\nconversation, than by any direct reasoning; or if the patient is too\r\nweak to laugh, some impression from nature is what he wants. I have\r\nmentioned the cruelty of letting him stare at a dead wall. In many\r\ndiseases, especially in convalescence from fever, that wall will appear\r\nto make all sorts of faces at him; now flowers never do this. Form,\r\ncolour, will free your patient from his painful ideas better than any\r\nargument.\r\n\r\n[20]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Desperate desire in the sick to \"see out of window.\"]\r\n\r\nI remember a case in point. A man received an injury to the spine, from\r\nan accident, which after a long confinement ended in death. He was a\r\nworkman--had not in his composition a single grain of what is called\r\n\"enthusiasm for nature,\"--but he was desperate to \"see once more out of\r\nwindow.\" His nurse actually got him on her back, and managed to perch\r\nhim up at the window for an instant, \"to see out.\" The consequence to\r\nthe poor nurse was a serious illness, which nearly proved fatal. The man\r\nnever knew it; but a great many other people did. Yet the consequence in\r\nnone of their minds, so far as I know, was the conviction that the\r\ncraving for variety in the starving eye, is just as desperate as that\r\nfor food in the starving stomach, and tempts the famishing creature in\r\neither case to steal for its satisfaction. No other word will express it\r\nbut \"desperation.\" And it sets the seal of ignorance and stupidity just\r\nas much on the governors and attendants of the sick if they do not\r\nprovide the sick-bed with a \"view\" of some kind, as if they did not\r\nprovide the hospital with a kitchen.\r\n\r\n[21]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical effect of colour.]\r\n\r\nNo one who has watched the sick can doubt the fact, that some feel\r\nstimulus from looking at scarlet flowers, exhaustion from looking at\r\ndeep blue, &c.\r\n\r\n[22]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nurse must have some rule of time about the patient's diet.]\r\n\r\nWhy, because the nurse has not got some food to-day which the patient\r\ntakes, can the patient wait four hours for food to-day, who could not\r\nwait two hours yesterday? Yet this is the only logic one generally\r\nhears. On the other hand, the other logic, viz., of the nurse giving a\r\npatient a thing because she _has_ got it, is equally fatal. If she\r\nhappens to have fresh jelly, or fresh fruit, she will frequently give it\r\nto the patient half-an-hour after his dinner, or at his dinner, when he\r\ncannot possibly eat that and the broth too--or worse still leave it by\r\nhis bed-side till he is so sickened with the sight of it, that he cannot\r\neat it at all.\r\n\r\n[23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intelligent cravings of particular sick for particular\r\narticles of diet.]\r\n\r\nIn the diseases produced by bad food, such as scorbutic dysentery and\r\ndiarrhoea, the patient's stomach often craves for and digests things,\r\nsome of which certainly would be laid down in no dietary that ever was\r\ninvented for sick, and especially not for such sick. These are fruit,\r\npickles, jams, gingerbread, fat of ham or of bacon, suet, cheese,\r\nbutter, milk. These cases I have seen not by ones, nor by tens, but by\r\nhundreds. And the patient's stomach was right and the book was wrong.\r\nThe articles craved for, in these cases, might have been principally\r\narranged under the two heads of fat and vegetable acids.\r\n\r\nThere is often a marked difference between men and women in this matter\r\nof sick feeding. Women's digestion is generally slower.\r\n\r\n[24] It is made a frequent recommendation to persons about to incur\r\ngreat exhaustion, either from the nature of the service or from their\r\nbeing not in a state fit for it, to eat a piece of bread before they go.\r\nI wish the recommenders would themselves try the experiment of\r\nsubstituting a piece of bread for a cup of tea or coffee or beef tea as\r\na refresher. They would find it a very poor comfort. When soldiers have\r\nto set out fasting on fatiguing duty, when nurses have to go fasting in\r\nto their patients, it is a hot restorative they want, and ought to have,\r\nbefore they go, not a cold bit of bread. And dreadful have been the\r\nconsequences of neglecting this. If they can take a bit of bread _with_\r\nthe hot cup of tea, so much the better, but not _instead_ of it. The\r\nfact that there is more nourishment in bread than in almost anything\r\nelse has probably induced the mistake. That it is a fatal mistake there\r\nis no doubt. It seems, though very little is known on the subject, that\r\nwhat \"assimilates\" itself directly and with the least trouble of\r\ndigestion with the human body is the best for the above circumstances.\r\nBread requires two or three processes of assimilation, before it becomes\r\nlike the human body.\r\n\r\nThe almost universal testimony of English men and women who have\r\nundergone great fatigue, such as riding long journeys without stopping,\r\nor sitting up for several nights in succession, is that they could do it\r\nbest upon an occasional cup of tea--and nothing else.\r\n\r\nLet experience, not theory, decide upon this as upon all other things.\r\n\r\n[25] In making coffee, it is absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry\r\nand grind it at home. Otherwise you may reckon upon its containing a\r\ncertain amount of chicory, _at least_. This is not a question of the\r\ntaste or of the wholesomeness of chicory. It is that chicory has nothing\r\nat all of the properties for which you give coffee. And therefore you\r\nmay as well not give it.\r\n\r\nAgain, all laundresses, mistresses of dairy-farms, head nurses (I speak\r\nof the good old sort only--women who unite a good deal of hard manual\r\nlabour with the head-work necessary for arranging the day's business, so\r\nthat none of it shall tread upon the heels of something else) set great\r\nvalue, I have observed, upon having a high-priced tea. This is called\r\nextravagant. But these women are \"extravagant\" in nothing else. And they\r\nare right in this. Real tea-leaf tea alone contains the restorative they\r\nwant; which is not to be found in sloe-leaf tea.\r\n\r\nThe mistresses of houses, who cannot even go over their own house once a\r\nday, are incapable of judging for these women. For they are incapable\r\nthemselves, to all appearance, of the spirit of arrangement (no small\r\ntask) necessary for managing a large ward or dairy.\r\n\r\n[26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nurses often do not think the sick room any business of\r\ntheirs, but only the sick.]\r\n\r\nI once told a \"very good nurse\" that the way in which her patient's room\r\nwas kept was quite enough to account for his sleeplessness; and she\r\nanswered quite good-humouredly she was not at all surprised at it--as if\r\nthe state of the room were, like the state of the weather, entirely out\r\nof her power. Now in what sense was this woman to be called a \"nurse?\"\r\n\r\n[27] For the same reason if, after washing a patient, you must put the\r\nsame night-dress on him again, always give it a preliminary warm at the\r\nfire. The night-gown he has worn must be, to a certain extent, damp. It\r\nhas now got cold from having been off him for a few minutes. The fire\r\nwill dry and at the same time air it. This is much more important than\r\nwith clean things.\r\n\r\n[28]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How a room is _dusted_.]\r\n\r\nIf you like to clean your furniture by laying out your clean clothes\r\nupon your dirty chairs or sofa, this is one way certainly of doing it.\r\nHaving witnessed the morning process called \"tidying the room,\" for many\r\nyears, and with ever-increasing astonishment, I can describe what it is.\r\nFrom the chairs, tables, or sofa, upon which the \"things\" have lain\r\nduring the night, and which are therefore comparatively clean from dust\r\nor blacks, the poor \"_things_\" having \"caught\" it, they are removed to\r\nother chairs, tables, sofas, upon which you could write your name with\r\nyour finger in the dust or blacks. The _other_ side of the \"things\" is\r\ntherefore now evenly dirtied or dusted. The housemaid then flaps every\r\nthing, or some things, not out of her reach, with a thing called a\r\nduster--the dust flies up, then re-settles more equally than it lay\r\nbefore the operation. The room has now been \"put to rights.\"\r\n\r\n[29]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Atmosphere in painted and papered rooms quite\r\ndistinguishable.]\r\n\r\nI am sure that a person who has accustomed her senses to compare\r\natmospheres proper and improper, for the sick and for children, could\r\ntell, blindfold, the difference of the air in old painted and in old\r\npapered rooms, _coeteris paribus_. The latter will always be musty, even\r\nwith all the windows open.\r\n\r\n[30]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How to keep your wall clean at the expense of your clothes.]\r\n\r\nIf you like to wipe your dirty door, or some portion of your dirty wall,\r\nby hanging up your clean gown or shawl against it on a peg, this is one\r\nway certainly, and the most usual way, and generally the only way of\r\ncleaning either door or wall in a bed-room!\r\n\r\n[31]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absurd statistical comparisons made in common conversation by\r\nthe most sensible people for the benefit of the sick.]\r\n\r\nThere are, of course cases, as in first confinements, when an assurance\r\nfrom the doctor or experienced nurse to the frightened suffering woman\r\nthat there is nothing unusual in her case, that she has nothing to fear\r\nbut a few hours' pain, may cheer her most effectually. This is advice of\r\nquite another order. It is the advice of experience to utter\r\ninexperience. But the advice we have been referring to is the advice of\r\ninexperience to bitter experience; and, in general, amounts to nothing\r\nmore than this, that _you_ think _I_ shall recover from consumption,\r\nbecause somebody knows somebody somewhere who has recovered from fever.\r\n\r\nI have heard a doctor condemned whose patient did not, alas! recover,\r\nbecause another doctor's patient of a _different_ sex, of a _different_\r\nage, recovered from a _different_ disease, in a _different_ place. Yes,\r\nthis is really true. If people who make these comparisons did but know\r\n(only they do not care to know), the care and preciseness with which\r\nsuch comparisons require to be made, (and are made), in order to be of\r\nany value whatever, they would spare their tongues. In comparing the\r\ndeaths of one hospital with those of another, any statistics are justly\r\nconsidered absolutely valueless which do not give the ages, the sexes,\r\nand the diseases of all the cases. It does not seem necessary to mention\r\nthis. It does not seem necessary to say that there can be no comparison\r\nbetween old men with dropsies and young women with consumptions. Yet the\r\ncleverest men and the cleverest women are often heard making such\r\ncomparisons, ignoring entirely sex, age, disease, place--in fact, _all_\r\nthe conditions essential to the question. It is the merest _gossip_.\r\n\r\n[32] A small pet animal is often an excellent companion for the sick,\r\nfor long chronic cases especially. A pet bird in a cage is sometimes the\r\nonly pleasure of an invalid confined for years to the same room. If he\r\ncan feed and clean the animal himself, he ought always to be encouraged\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n[33] It is a much more difficult thing to speak the truth than people\r\ncommonly imagine. There is the want of observation _simple_, and the\r\nwant of observation _compound_, compounded, that is, with the\r\nimaginative faculty. Both may equally intend to speak the truth. The\r\ninformation of the first is simply defective. That of the second is much\r\nmore dangerous. The first gives, in answer to a question asked about a\r\nthing that has been before his eyes perhaps for years, information\r\nexceedingly imperfect, or says, he does not know. He has never observed.\r\nAnd people simply think him stupid.\r\n\r\nThe second has observed just as little, but imagination immediately\r\nsteps in, and he describes the whole thing from imagination merely,\r\nbeing perfectly convinced all the while that he has seen or heard it; or\r\nhe will repeat a whole conversation, as if it were information which had\r\nbeen addressed to him; whereas it is merely what he has himself said to\r\nsomebody else. This is the commonest of all. These people do not even\r\nobserve that they have _not_ observed nor remember that they have\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nCourts of justice seem to think that any body can speak \"the whole truth\r\nand nothing but the truth,\" if he does but intend it. It requires many\r\nfaculties combined of observation and memory to speak \"the whole truth\"\r\nand to say \"nothing but the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knows I fibs dreadful: but believe me, Miss, I never finds out I have\r\nfibbed until they tells me so,\" was a remark actually made. It is also\r\none of much more extended application than most people have the least\r\nidea of.\r\n\r\nConcurrence of testimony, which is so often adduced as final proof, may\r\nprove nothing more, as is well known to those accustomed to deal with\r\nthe unobservant imaginative, than that one person has told his story a\r\ngreat many times.\r\n\r\nI have heard thirteen persons \"concur\" in declaring that a fourteenth,\r\nwho had never left his bed, went to a distant chapel every morning at\r\nseven o'clock.\r\n\r\nI have heard persons in perfect good faith declare, that a man came to\r\ndine every day at the house where they lived, who had never dined there\r\nonce; that a person had never taken the sacrament, by whose side they\r\nhad twice at least knelt at Communion; that but one meal a day came out\r\nof a hospital kitchen, which for six weeks they had seen provide from\r\nthree to five and six meals a day. Such instances might be multiplied\r\n_ad infinitum_ if necessary.\r\n\r\n[34] This is important, because on this depends what the remedy will be.\r\nIf a patient sleeps two or three hours early in the night, and then does\r\nnot sleep again at all, ten to one it is not a narcotic he wants, but\r\nfood or stimulus, or perhaps only warmth. If on the other hand, he is\r\nrestless and awake all night, and is drowsy in the morning, he probably\r\nwants sedatives, either quiet, coolness, or medicine, a lighter diet, or\r\nall four. Now the doctor should be told this, or how can he judge what\r\nto give?\r\n\r\n[35]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More important to spare the patient thought than physical\r\nexertion.]\r\n\r\nIt is commonly supposed that the nurse is there to spare the patient\r\nfrom making physical exertion for himself--I would rather say that she\r\nought to be there to spare him from taking thought for himself. And I am\r\nquite sure, that if the patient were spared all thought for himself, and\r\n_not_ spared all physical exertion, he would be infinitely the gainer.\r\nThe reverse is generally the case in the private house. In the hospital\r\nit is the relief from all anxiety, afforded by the rules of a\r\nwell-regulated institution, which has often such a beneficial effect\r\nupon the patient.\r\n\r\n[36]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English women have great capacity of but little practice in\r\nclose observation.]\r\n\r\nIt may be too broad an assertion, and it certainly sounds like a\r\nparadox. But I think that in no country are women to be found so\r\ndeficient in ready and sound observation as in England, while peculiarly\r\ncapable of being trained to it. The French or Irish woman is too quick\r\nof perception to be so sound an observer--the Teuton is too slow to be\r\nso ready an observer as the English woman might be. Yet English women\r\nlay themselves open to the charge so often made against them by men,\r\nviz., that they are not to be trusted in handicrafts to which their\r\nstrength is quite equal, for want of a practised and steady observation.\r\nIn countries where women (with average intelligence certainly not\r\nsuperior to that of Englishwomen) are employed, e.g., in dispensing,\r\nmen responsible for what these women do (not theorizing about man's and\r\nwoman's \"missions\"), have stated that they preferred the service of\r\nwomen to that of men, as being more exact, more careful, and incurring\r\nfewer mistakes of inadvertence.\r\n\r\nNow certainly Englishwomen are peculiarly capable of attaining to this.\r\n\r\nI remember when a child, hearing the story of an accident, related by\r\nsome one who sent two girls to fetch a \"bottle of salvolatile from her\r\nroom;\" \"Mary could not stir,\" she said, \"Fanny ran and fetched a bottle\r\nthat was not salvolatile, and that was not in my room.\"\r\n\r\nNow this sort of thing pursues every one through life. A woman is asked\r\nto fetch a large new bound red book, lying on the table by the window,\r\nand she fetches five small old boarded brown books lying on the shelf by\r\nthe fire. And this, though she has \"put that room to rights\" every day\r\nfor a month perhaps, and must have observed the books every day, lying\r\nin the same places, for a month, if she had any observation.\r\n\r\nHabitual observation is the more necessary, when any sudden call arises.\r\nIf \"Fanny\" had observed \"the bottle of salvolatile\" in \"the aunt's\r\nroom,\" every day she was there, she would more probably have found it\r\nwhen it was suddenly wanted.\r\n\r\nThere are two causes for these mistakes of inadvertence. 1. A want of\r\nready attention; only part of the request is heard at all. 2. A want of\r\nthe habit of observation.\r\n\r\nTo a nurse I would add, take care that you always put the same things in\r\nthe same places; you don't know how suddenly you may be called on some\r\nday to find something, and may not be able to remember in your haste\r\nwhere you yourself had put it, if your memory is not in the habit of\r\nseeing the thing there always.\r\n\r\n[37]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Approach of death, paleness by no means an invariable effect,\r\nas we find in novels.]\r\n\r\nIt falls to few ever to have had the opportunity of observing the\r\ndifferent aspects which the human face puts on at the sudden approach of\r\ncertain forms of death by violence; and as it is a knowledge of little\r\nuse I only mention it here as being the most startling example of what I\r\nmean. In the nervous temperament the face becomes pale (this is the only\r\n_recognized_ effect); in the sanguine temperament purple; in the bilious\r\nyellow, or every manner of colour in patches. Now, it is generally\r\nsupposed that paleness is the one indication of almost any violent\r\nchange in the human being, whether from terror, disease, or anything\r\nelse. There can be no more false observation. Granted, it is the one\r\nrecognized livery, as I have said--_de rigueur_ in novels, but nowhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n[38] I have known two cases, the one of a man who intentionally and\r\nrepeatedly displaced a dislocation, and was kept and petted by all the\r\nsurgeons, the other of one who was pronounced to have nothing the matter\r\nwith him, there being no organic change perceptible, but who died within\r\nthe week. In both these cases, it was the nurse who, by accurately\r\npointing out what she had accurately observed, to the doctors, saved the\r\none case from persevering in a fraud, the other from being discharged\r\nwhen actually in a dying state.\r\n\r\nI will even go further and say, that in diseases which have their origin\r\nin the feeble or irregular action of some function, and not in organic\r\nchange, it is quite an accident if the doctor who sees the case only\r\nonce a day, and generally at the same time, can form any but a negative\r\nidea of its real condition. In the middle of the day, when such a\r\npatient has been refreshed by light and air, by his tea, his beef tea,\r\nand his brandy, by hot bottles to his feet, by being washed and by clean\r\nlinen, you can scarcely believe that he is the same person as lay with a\r\nrapid fluttering pulse, with puffed eye-lids, with short breath, cold\r\nlimbs, and unsteady hands, this morning. Now what is a nurse to do in\r\nsuch a case? Not cry, \"Lord bless you, sir, why you'd have thought he\r\nwere a dying all night.\" This may be true, but it is not the way to\r\nimpress with the truth a doctor, more capable of forming a judgment from\r\nthe facts, if he did but know them, than you are. What he wants is not\r\nyour opinion, however respectfully given, but your facts. In all\r\ndiseases it is important, but in diseases which do not run a distinct\r\nand fixed course, it is not only important, it is essential that the\r\nfacts the nurse alone can observe, should be accurately observed, and\r\naccurately reported to the doctor.\r\n\r\nI must direct the nurse's attention to the extreme variation there is\r\nnot unfrequently in the pulse of such patients during the day. A very\r\ncommon case is this: Between 3 and 4 A.M. the pulse becomes\r\nquick, perhaps 130, and so thready it is not like a pulse at all, but\r\nlike a string vibrating just underneath the skin. After this the patient\r\ngets no more sleep. About mid-day the pulse has come down to 80; and\r\nthough feeble and compressible is a very respectable pulse. At night, if\r\nthe patient has had a day of excitement, it is almost imperceptible.\r\nBut, if the patient has had a good day, it is stronger and steadier and\r\nnot quicker than at mid-day. This is a common history of a common pulse;\r\nand others, equally varying during the day, might be given. Now, in\r\ninflammation, which may almost always be detected by the pulse, in\r\ntyphoid fever, which is accompanied by the low pulse that nothing will\r\nraise, there is no such great variation. And doctors and nurses become\r\naccustomed not to look for it. The doctor indeed cannot. But the\r\nvariation is in itself an important feature.\r\n\r\nCases like the above often \"go off rather suddenly,\" as it is called,\r\nfrom some trifling ailment of a few days, which just makes up the sum of\r\nexhaustion necessary to produce death. And everybody cries, who would\r\nhave thought it? except the observing nurse, if there is one, who had\r\nalways expected the exhaustion to come, from which there would be no\r\nrally, because she knew the patient had no capital in strength on which\r\nto draw, if he failed for a few days to make his barely daily income in\r\nsleep and nutrition.\r\n\r\nI have often seen really good nurses distressed, because they could not\r\nimpress the doctor with the real danger of their patient; and quite\r\nprovoked because the patient \"would look,\" either \"so much better\" or\r\n\"so much worse\" than he really is \"when the doctor was there.\" The\r\ndistress is very legitimate, but it generally arises from the nurse not\r\nhaving the power of laying clearly and shortly before the doctor the\r\nfacts from which she derives her opinion, or from the doctor being hasty\r\nand inexperienced, and not capable of eliciting them. A man who really\r\ncares for his patients, will soon learn to ask for and appreciate the\r\ninformation of a nurse, who is at once a careful observer and a clear\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\n[39]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of physicking by amateur females.]\r\n\r\nI have known many ladies who, having once obtained a \"blue pill\"\r\nprescription from a physician, gave and took it as a common aperient two\r\nor three times a week--with what effect may be supposed. In one case I\r\nhappened to be the person to inform the physician of it, who substituted\r\nfor the prescription a comparatively harmless aperient pill. The lady\r\ncame to me and complained that it \"did not suit her half so well.\"\r\n\r\nIf women will take or give physic, by far the safest plan is to send for\r\n\"the doctor\" every time--for I have known ladies who both gave and took\r\nphysic, who would not take the pains to learn the names of the commonest\r\nmedicines, and confounded, e.g., colocynth with colchicum. This _is_\r\nplaying with sharp edged tools \"with a vengeance.\"\r\n\r\nThere are excellent women who will write to London to their physician\r\nthat there is much sickness in their neighbourhood in the country, and\r\nask for some prescription from him, which they used to like themselves,\r\nand then give it to all their friends and to all their poorer neighbours\r\nwho will take it. Now, instead of giving medicine, of which you cannot\r\npossibly know the exact and proper application, nor all its\r\nconsequences, would it not be better if you were to persuade and help\r\nyour poorer neighbours to remove the dung-hill from before the door, to\r\nput in a window which opens, or an Arnott's ventilator, or to cleanse\r\nand lime-wash the cottages? Of these things the benefits are sure. The\r\nbenefits of the inexperienced administration of medicines are by no\r\nmeans so sure.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathy has introduced one essential amelioration in the practice of\r\nphysic by amateur females; for its rules are excellent, its physicking\r\ncomparatively harmless--the \"globule\" is the one grain of folly which\r\nappears to be necessary to make any good thing acceptable. Let then\r\nwomen, if they will give medicine, give homoeopathic medicine. It won't\r\ndo any harm.\r\n\r\nAn almost universal error among women is the supposition that everybody\r\n_must_ have the bowels opened once in every twenty-four hours or must\r\nfly immediately to aperients. The reverse is the conclusion of\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThis is a doctor's subject, and I will not enter more into it; but will\r\nsimply repeat, do not go on taking or giving to your children your\r\nabominable \"courses of aperients,\" without calling in the doctor.\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom indeed, that by choosing your diet, you cannot\r\nregulate your own bowels; and every woman may watch herself to know what\r\nkind of diet will do this; I have known deficiency of meat produce\r\nconstipation, quite as often as deficiency of vegetables; baker's bread\r\nmuch oftener than either. Home made brown bread will oftener cure it\r\nthan anything else.\r\n\r\n[40] A curious fact will be shown by Table A, viz., that 18,122 out of\r\n39,139, or nearly one-half of all the nurses, in domestic service, are\r\nbetween 5 and 20 years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY HARRISON AND SONS,\r\nST.
