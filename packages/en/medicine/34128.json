But even while Simpson was growing out of childhood all the\r\npowers of such professional giants as Bright, Addison, Abernethy,\r\nAstley Cooper, and Charles Bell, were insufficient to dispel the\r\nmassive cloud of mystery and superstition which enveloped the practice\r\nof both medicine and surgery in this country and obscured whatever\r\nthere was of truth in the teaching of these men.\r\n\r\nIn the first decade or two of this century the medical profession had\r\nnot yet entirely abandoned the use of the golden-headed cane, nor had\r\nwhat Oliver Wendell Holmes calls the solemn farce of overdrugging yet\r\nceased. \"Humours,\" \"impostumes,\" \"iliac passions,\" and such like were\r\nstill spoken of--terms now heard only amongst country-folks in remote\r\ndistricts and that rarely, or encountered in curious old medical\r\npublications. Messes and abominations, prepared by the apothecaries\r\naccording to more or less secret recipes handed down through the\r\nMiddle Ages, were swallowed in good faith; blood-letting was still a\r\npanacea; and such remedies as that of holding a live puppy to the\r\nbody for the relief of colic still had their professional advocates,\r\nbut happily a decreasing number; whilst those pains\r\n\r\n          \"... In the hour,\r\n  When the veil of the body we feel\r\n  Rent round us--while torments reveal\r\n  The motherhood's advent in power\"\r\n\r\n--pains which Simpson was the first truly to relieve by his\r\napplication of anaesthetics, were gravely said to be alleviated by\r\nthe swallowing of a concoction of white onions and oil. Surgery\r\nwas no doubt ahead of medicine; but the early surgical records of\r\nthis century have little more than a curious interest to modern\r\npractitioners. Operations entirely unknown to our professional\r\nforefathers less than a century ago are now performed in safety\r\ndaily. Such mysterious diseases as \"icteric irritative fever\" and\r\n\"acute sinking\" after operations, dreaded then with the fear that is\r\nalways inspired by unseen or ill-understood dangers, have vanished\r\nbefore the progress of modern science in which the introduction of\r\nanaesthesia was the first great step.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the branch of medicine which Simpson made so\r\npeculiarly his own--that of obstetrics--originally in the hands of\r\nwomen only, had been fiercely contested for by the two sexes during\r\ntwo centuries, and such was the feeling against man-midwives in\r\nScotland that the dispute had scarcely ceased at Simpson's birth. The\r\nstronger sex, however, was then at last asserting its superiority,\r\nand to be an accoucheur was beginning to be considered after all as\r\nworthy of a gentleman. The despised art was preparing for its\r\nrenaissance.\r\n\r\nSimpson grew to manhood whilst science, aided by precise methods of\r\naccurate observation, was shedding new light upon physic, surgery,\r\nand obstetrics. In fulfilling his great part in establishing the\r\nhealing art on a firm scientific basis, Simpson encountered the full\r\nforce of the ignorance and prejudice of his day both within and\r\nwithout his profession. It was, perhaps, fortunate that he was brought\r\nup in a small village and in a rank of life where he would meet from\r\nhis earliest days with many superstitious beliefs and practices,\r\nstrange and utterly irrational. A mind such as his would meet,\r\nreason, and experiment these out of existence. Probably through\r\nthese circumstances he conceived the taste for archaeology and\r\nantiquarian research which were his recreation in later years; but,\r\nwhat was more important, he gained also some training for the\r\nstruggle with ignorance, untruth, and irrationalism, into which he\r\nthrew with his eager vigour the whole strength of his manhood.\r\n\r\nSimpson was born in the village of Bathgate, in Linlithgowshire, where\r\nhis father, David Simpson, was the local baker. David's father, who\r\ndied at the ripe age of ninety-one a few years after James's birth,\r\nwas the descendant of a line of small hard-working farmers, who added\r\nto his work and his profit the practice of farriery. Although modern\r\nscience has, by the aid of bacteriology, proved such practitioners of\r\nthe rough veterinary medicine of the day to have been right in\r\nascribing to unseen influences many of the diseases of animals which\r\nthey found themselves powerless to check, the methods they employed\r\nfor treatment when what they called witchcraft was at work scarcely\r\nhave the support of present-day practitioners. In one of his addresses\r\nupon archaeology Simpson records how his grandfather ordered and his\r\nown father took part in the burial alive of a cow in order to appease\r\nthe evil spirit which was spreading the plague of murrain with fatal\r\neffect. And the older gentleman was known to have had more than one\r\nserious encounter with a witch. On one occasion an old beggar woman,\r\nwho plied her calling in quite an original method--that of being\r\nwheeled in a barrow from farm to farm--hurled curses at old Simpson\r\nfor ordering a servant to wheel her from his house on to her next\r\ncalling-place, and vowed an awful vengeance on his family if he did\r\nnot replace the servant with one of his stalwart sons. The farmer\r\nrecollected that an ill event had followed the old woman's last visit,\r\nand quickly drew a sharp flint from his pocket and made a gash across\r\nher forehead with it. \"Ah,\" he exclaimed, \"I see what ye're noo, ye\r\nauld witch; but I've scored ye aboon the braith and my house is\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nSimpson noted these and many other curious practices and beliefs, and\r\nafterwards pointed out in one of his addresses that they were\r\nprobably, for the most part, relics of the pagan creeds and customs of\r\nour ancestors. He urged the making of a collection of the folk-lore of\r\nScotland, ere it utterly disappeared before the march of modern\r\ncivilisation, and suggested that, perhaps, some archaeological Cuvier\r\nmight one day be able to re-construct from these mythological\r\nfragments distinct pictures of the heathen practices, rites, and\r\nfaiths of our forefathers.\r\n\r\nIn his early boyhood he listened to many stories of local and family\r\nsuperstitions told to him with all the earnestness of a firm believer\r\nby his father. He himself was the object of superstitious admiration\r\nto the simple villagers all through his boyhood, and they freely\r\nforetold great deeds from him in later years; for he was a seventh\r\nson, and the good luck which seventh sons were supposed to bring had\r\nappeared in the family soon after his birth. Up to the day on which\r\nJames first saw the light, June 7, 1811, the baker's business had been\r\ngoing steadily from bad to worse, and the shop books showed that on\r\nthat very day the lowest depths were reached. The baker, David\r\nSimpson, seems to have been curiously lacking in business method,\r\nalthough he was a hard-working man. But after James's birth he wisely\r\ninterested his wife in his affairs, with the result that she\r\nenergetically and successfully bestirred herself to recoup their\r\nfallen fortunes. Mrs. Simpson was directly descended from a fugitive\r\nHuguenot family, settled for many years on a farm near Bathgate, and\r\nintermarried with well-known families. Through her, indeed, Simpson\r\nclaimed a distant relationship with the national hero, Sir William\r\nWallace. The cares of her family and the strain of managing the\r\nincreasing baker's business proved too much for her always delicate\r\nconstitution, and she died when James was only nine years old. There\r\nis no doubt that the youngest child and favourite son had an unusually\r\nlarge share of his mother's society during those years; he was a\r\npeculiarly attractive child, \"a rosy bairn wi' laughin' mou' and\r\ndimpled cheeks,\" and his manner, even when he was little more than an\r\ninfant, was quiet and affectionate. When physical sufferings overtook\r\nthe mother, the child's quiet sympathy and engaging manner helped and\r\ncomforted her. Her own nature was bright, vivacious, and energetic,\r\nquick to think and prompt to act; and she was full of love, sympathy,\r\nand piety. These maternal traits influenced the youth, and added a\r\nsoft, refined--delicately refined--tone to the paternal influence,\r\nwhence he received self-reliance and habits of persevering industry.\r\n\r\nThe boy's school-life began at the age of four years. The orthodox\r\nlearning came very easily to him; he entered into both work and play\r\nso whole-heartedly that he at once became known as the \"wise wean,\"\r\nand was at the same time ever sought after by his school-mates as a\r\ncompanion in out-door sports. The parish schoolmaster was one James\r\nTaylor, who had considerable ability for the post, and encouraged his\r\npupils by kindly personal interest to develop affection for learning.\r\nBut for Simpson there were other teachers and greater subjects for\r\nstudy in the countryside around Bathgate. The district was full of\r\nrich treasures for the field naturalist and for the antiquarian.\r\nBathgate lies between the Firth of Forth and the Pentland Hills, in a\r\ngeologically varied district, with a varied and abundant flora and\r\nfauna--more so in those days when Bathgate was a small village of\r\nhand-loom weavers than latterly, when it was a thriving little town,\r\nthe centre of a coal, shale, and ironstone mining industry. The\r\narchaeological features of the neighbourhood were full of interest.\r\nThere was the famous \"Catstane,\" of Kirkliston, which had puzzled\r\nantiquarians even before the establishment of the Scots Society in\r\n1780, and at Kipps was one of the few remaining cromlechs--and that a\r\nruined one--in Scotland; whilst the line of the Roman wall between the\r\nFirth of Forth and the Clyde was not far distant. There were traces of\r\na Cistercian monastery founded by David I., and various hills and\r\nfields and caves were associated with the names of Sir William\r\nWallace, Robert Bruce, and King Edward I.\r\n\r\nSimpson thoroughly familiarised himself in boyhood with the natural\r\nfeatures, as well as with the antiquarian objects in the district.\r\nHe continued to investigate them during his vacations when a student\r\nat Edinburgh University, and rendered the neighbourhood famous\r\narchaeologically by masterly monographs written when he was at the\r\nheight of his fame. Amongst the village hand-loom weavers, a race\r\nof peculiarly observant and intelligent men, there were some who\r\nstudied both the antiquarian objects and the natural history of\r\nLinlithgowshire. Simpson used to speak of one man, a daily labourer\r\nat the loom, who was able to write, in correct Latin, an accurate\r\ndescription of any plant or animal brought before him, although\r\nhis earnings at the loom never amounted to fifty pounds a year.\r\nThese men thoroughly enjoyed the evident interest of the \"young\r\nphilosopher\" in their discussions and demonstrations, at the same\r\ntime kindly directing his mind towards the simple, painstaking, true\r\nmethods of observing and reflecting upon nature. There was no lack\r\nof change in his environment for him; his interest in natural\r\nphenomena was roused and kept alive during his drives round the\r\ncountryside delivering bread to the farmers and cottagers, or in\r\noccasional visits to his parents' relations. He daily took his turn\r\nbehind the shop counter, reading, writing, or drawing in the\r\ninterval of waiting for customers. He trained himself to read or\r\ndo his school lessons as readily in a roomful of romping children\r\nas in the quiet of the bedroom. It has been said that he never knew\r\nan idle moment from the day of his birth onwards, and his was such\r\nan indomitable and persevering energy that the remark is no\r\nexaggeration. But the pathway to greatness was made specially smooth\r\nfor James Simpson. He was set upon it, and protected in his\r\nchildhood, and guided in his youth, with the one definite object\r\nalways in view. The Simpson family as well as the whole Bathgate\r\ncommunity, took it for granted that eminence was to be his in\r\nwhatever walk of life he entered seriously upon. His sister Mary and\r\nhis brother Alexander looked upon him as a special care; the former\r\nwatched over him as a mother, and the latter helped him in the ups\r\nand downs of boyhood, just as he constantly stood by him throughout\r\nthe difficult days of his later career. It had always been a\r\ncustom in Scots families of humble rank that one child, either from\r\nthe exhibition of a natural aptitude, or through the ambition of\r\nthe parents, was singled out to receive the advantages of a fuller\r\neducation such as is within the reach of every able lad in Scotland.\r\nHonour and glory would thus be brought to the family, greatest of\r\nall if from the pulpit, while the less favoured members of the family\r\nwould plod on in the same sphere of life as their parents. The world\r\nowes a great deal to the Simpsons, and particularly to Alexander, who\r\ncheerfully seconded their father's efforts to help forward their\r\nyoung brother, without a suspicion of jealousy. They knew he would\r\nbe great some day, and therein they looked for their reward.\r\n\r\nHappily there were ample means for all their requirements derived from\r\nthe now prosperous bakery. The money was kept in one drawer, the till\r\nwhere the shop earnings were placed. All the household were free to\r\ndraw thence supplies for their ordinary wants, James without stint;\r\nand he alone was exempted from the condition that he who profited must\r\nalso contribute by the sweat of his brow. The boy took very full\r\nadvantage of his fortunate circumstances and drank deeply of all the\r\nknowledge that came near and ever hunted for more. With each\r\nsucceeding year the craving to know, and to know thoroughly, became\r\nmore and more his ruling passion; by the time his schooldays were over\r\nit had gained complete mastery over him; happily for the human race\r\nProvidence had so endowed him that when knowledge had come wisdom did\r\nnot linger.\r\n\r\nHe was never in any way led away by the temptations that no doubt\r\nbeset every boy in a village of hard-drinkers such as Bathgate was in\r\nhis youth. Alexander took pains to warn him--\"Others may do this,\r\nJamie, but it would break all our hearts and blast all your prospects\r\nwere you to do it,\" he said. It was not necessary to make appeals to\r\nJames to work and fulfil the family predictions; he was as firmly\r\ndetermined to be great as they were sure he would be: He never forgot\r\nhow much he owed to the loving help of his family, and to the fact\r\nthat he was the youngest son growing up at a time when the family\r\nstruggles were fairly over; when instead of its being an effort for\r\nthe parents to provide the necessary funds for his education, the\r\nshop-till was well filled and the elder brothers and the loving sister\r\nwere at hand eagerly willing to help. In student days when struggles\r\ncame and the path seemed dark and beset with dangers, the knowledge of\r\nthe firm faith in his powers of the family at home and of the scarcely\r\nsmaller faith of the weavers, was a powerful incentive in the moments\r\nwhen he required any other than that of the spirit within him.\r\n\r\nWe cannot feel otherwise than thankful that up to the age of fourteen,\r\nwhen his schooldays ended, he had access to but a limited stock of\r\nliterature wherewith to gratify his hunger for knowledge. To satisfy\r\nhis appetite he was driven into the fields and the forests; every\r\nsense was stimulated, and became developed through repeated use. Thus\r\nhe laid the foundation of his phenomenal faculty of rapid and accurate\r\nobservation, and of his no less phenomenal memory.\r\n\r\nHis imagination was fed with the legends of the district and tales of\r\nhis remote moss-trooper ancestors told to him of an evening by his\r\nfather. Though happily saved from being a bookworm to the exclusion of\r\nsounder means for acquiring knowledge, he devoured and digested every\r\nscrap of literature which came in his way. Like all Scots children of\r\nhis class he learnt his Bible thoroughly from end to end--a knowledge\r\nwhich served him well in later years. Shakespeare followed the Bible\r\nin his own review of his favourite reading as a boy; but a gazetteer\r\nor an almanac was quite as acceptable. His taste was for solid\r\nfact--fact which he could learn and put to the test; thus the great\r\nopen book of Nature was the attraction he most readily yielded to. But\r\nnothing in book form ever came amiss to him; if between the covers\r\nthere was useful information to be had, Simpson extracted it and\r\nstored it away in his capacious brain.\r\n\r\nThe unusually large size of his head, a source of admiration in\r\nmanhood, was in childhood an object of wonder to observers. In manhood\r\nhe wore his hair in long locks, and this was apparently his habit in\r\nboyhood. Once a strange barber cut his hair so close that his brother\r\ntook upon himself to go and rebuke the man. \"The callant had suck a\r\nmuckle head,\" was the retort, \"I was doin' my best to mak' it look\r\nrespectable.\" A close-cropped head gave altogether a too sportive\r\nappearance to the \"young philosopher\" in the eyes of the watchful\r\nelder brother.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence that Simpson displayed in his schooldays any\r\nspecial leaning towards the medical profession; it cannot be\r\nreasonably urged that his grandfather's rough skill in the treatment\r\nof animals fostered any medical tendency in him, for James was but\r\nfive years old when the old man died. Even had he been of an age to\r\nunderstand them, the methods employed would have scarcely recommended\r\nthemselves to a youth of Simpson's nature, sufficiently to raise a\r\nspirit of emulation within him. It is also not recorded that the\r\nvillage doctor took any special interest in the boy or brought any\r\ninfluence to bear upon him; although his note-book thus gives the\r\nearliest record of the future prince of obstetricians:--\r\n\r\n  275.--June 7. Simpson, David, baker, Bathgate. Wife, Mary Jarvie.\r\n  AE. 40. 8th child, son. _Natus_ 8 o'clock. _Uti veniebam natus._\r\n  Paid 10s. 6d.\r\n\r\nJames displayed his superiority so decidedly in the village school\r\nthat when he reached the age of fourteen it was decided to send him to\r\nEdinburgh University without further waste of time. It was no unusual\r\nage for boys to commence their University career in Scotland. There\r\nwas no secondary education in the Scots provinces, but instruction\r\nintermediate between that of the parish school and what is ordinarily\r\nknown as University education was given within the walls of the\r\nUniversity itself. Boys of humble rank who aspired to a profession\r\nwere sent up, as indeed many still are, at the age of fourteen or\r\nfifteen, to attend these junior Arts classes in which this instruction\r\nwas, and still is, imparted. The University was crowded with\r\nschoolboys of all ranks of life gathered together from town and\r\ncountry, and consisted of nothing more than a collection of\r\nclass-rooms devoted to the giving of instruction in lecture form. This\r\nstepping-stone of junior classes threw open the higher education to\r\nhundreds of youths whose equals in England had no such advantage at\r\nthat time. Scots University education besides being thorough was\r\ndecidedly cheap, so that the church, law, and medicine received many\r\nrecruits from the class out of which Simpson was drawn.\r\n\r\nHis environment up to the age of fourteen was well calculated to train\r\nhim for the great work that lay before him. The legends of the\r\ndistrict, and the sight of the objects of archaeological interest which\r\nhe came across in his rambles out of school hours, were powerful\r\nstimuli to his sensations; whilst the accurate observation of natural\r\nphenomena in field and hedge which the kindly interested weavers\r\nhelped him to, was also a valuable educative influence. It is probable\r\nthat his senses received much of the training which was to lead to his\r\nultimately being the greatest physician of his day by these means,\r\nrather than from the instruction imparted to him in the village\r\nschool, or derived by him independently from the books that came in\r\nhis way. It was undoubtedly a fortunate circumstance that he was born\r\nand bred in an out-of-the-way country district, where he drew his\r\nlessons from Nature and the phenomena which lay round him, rather than\r\nin a great city where he would have been educated on the stereotyped\r\northodox system. When we look further back, asking why he saw sermons\r\nin stones and books in the running brooks, to which the bulk of his\r\nschoolfellows were entirely blind, we are bound to confess that we\r\nfind no satisfactory answer in his family history, to which it is\r\ncustomary to look for an explanation of such tendencies. Heredity\r\nplayed no great part in making Simpson great; from the paternal side\r\nthere was imparted to him a vigorous physique; from his mother he\r\nreceived the bright, happy, sympathetic, and alert disposition, which\r\ndescended through her from his French ancestors. He was provided with\r\na brain of marvellous quality and phenomenal size. But it was the\r\nenvironment which acted upon this brain and brought out the capacities\r\nborn in him without any apparent hereditary bias, and which might have\r\nremained entirely latent under less favourable circumstances. No small\r\npart of the development was due to the people among whom he lived; a\r\nrace of men accustomed to rely upon their senses which were always\r\nwith them, rather than upon books which they seldom saw, even if they\r\nwere able to read them; and to observe not only all that lay around\r\nthem, but also the characteristics of their fellowmen with whom they\r\nwere brought into contact--the close contact of different classes\r\nwhich obtains in village and rural life. Simpson was taught to study\r\nNature whether in field or fellow-creature first, and the knowledge\r\nand opinions of men as expressed in books afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSTUDENT DAYS. 1825-1830.\r\n\r\n  Visit to Edinburgh--Sent to the University--Takes the Arts\r\n  classes--Gains a bursary--Influence of MacArthur and Reid--Robert\r\n  Knox the anatomist--The Burke and Hare murders--Superiority of the\r\n  extra-mural teachers of the day--Edinburgh an intellectual\r\n  centre--University life--His mode of living as a student--Apprenticed\r\n  to a chemist--Studies surgery under Liston--Regularly falls asleep\r\n  in the obstetric class--Influence of his teachers--Verse\r\n  writing--Description of the medical student of the day--Vacation\r\n  work--Death of his father--Obtains qualification to practice at\r\n  the age of eighteen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Edinburgh was only eighteen miles from Bathgate, Simpson\r\nvisited it only once as a schoolboy; probably he walked all the way,\r\nfor railroads were as yet unknown and it was not a long walk for a\r\ncountry-bred vigorous youth. He exercised his already formed habit of\r\nnoting objects of interest during this great event in his boyhood, and\r\nin his journal there are copies of old inscriptions from tombs in the\r\nfamous Greyfriars' Churchyard to which he made his pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nThe boy's nearest and dearest ambition was to become a student at \"the\r\nCollege,\" as Edinburgh University was familiarly termed. It received\r\nencouragement in the periodical return to the village of elder boys\r\nwho had gone up before him. He was specially struck, and afterwards\r\nstimulated, by the appearance of one John Reid, his senior by two\r\nyears, and his former companion in many a country ramble, who came\r\nback for the vacations smartened up both physically and mentally by\r\nthe new life.\r\n\r\nAlthough the collegiate life characteristic of Oxford was unknown in\r\nScots Universities, there was social intercourse amongst the boys very\r\ndifferent from that of the village. The ancient Edinburgh University\r\nattracted students from all parts of the world, mostly for the medical\r\ncurriculum, but many preceded the professional course with a year or\r\ntwo's attendance on the Arts classes; and it was usual for young\r\nEnglishmen of good family to spend a session at Edinburgh before going\r\nto Oxford or Cambridge. Probably before he entered the medical\r\nclasses, Simpson rubbed shoulders with lads of all ranks from home and\r\nabroad. Pillans was at this time the Professor of Humanity, Wallace\r\nheld the chair of Mathematics, John Wilson--better known as\r\nChristopher North--that of Moral Philosophy, and Dunbar was Professor\r\nof Greek. Wallace had begun life as a bookbinder's apprentice, and\r\nDunbar had risen from being a gardener; the example of these men under\r\nwhose influence he was brought encouraged the baker's son to go and\r\ndo likewise.\r\n\r\nThe family had sent him off to the College with the mission to be\r\nfamous, and he was beginning only in an orthodox fashion when he\r\nentered himself for the curriculum in Arts. It had been easy for him,\r\nwith his magnificent brain power, to stand _dux_ of the village school\r\nover the ordinary village youth; but here, in Edinburgh, he was\r\nbrought into competition with the picked boys from other country\r\nschools, and intellectually eager youths from town schools where the\r\ncourse of instruction was such as more easily to lead to early\r\nUniversity success than that of the Bathgate parish school. At first\r\nhe found difficulty and desponded. The keen observer with senses all\r\nalert was dashed to find so much of the College life to which he had\r\nso eagerly looked forward only a magnified repetition of the dull\r\nschool routine. But he was too intent on ultimate success to be\r\nrepulsed by his initial disappointment, and soon brought his mind into\r\nadjustment with the circumstances he found himself in, reserving\r\nleisure time and vacations for the exercise of his faculties as he\r\nmost loved to exercise them. He did not persevere in the Arts course\r\nafter he found his tastes led him to other studies; he did not trouble\r\nto obtain the Master of Arts degree, which was then conferred in a\r\nvery lax manner; probably he saw its worthlessness, for it was not\r\nuntil the passing of the Scots Universities Act in 1858 that this\r\ndegree became really valuable. He recognised, however, the value of\r\nlaying a good foundation of general knowledge; without straining after\r\nany distinction he acquitted himself creditably in all his classes. In\r\nthe second year of the curriculum he won one of the numerous small\r\nbursaries of the value of L10 a year, for which logic was one of the\r\nchief subjects of examination; but as candidates were restricted to\r\nthose who possessed either the name of the founder, Stewart, or that\r\nof his wife, Simpson, the competition was not particularly severe. His\r\nindividuality and natural straightforwardness attracted the attention\r\nof some of his professors. The boldness of his original essays\r\nprovided them with food for comment in a manner dear to the\r\nprofessorial heart.\r\n\r\nThe Arts curriculum served him usefully in helping to develop a\r\nliterary style and in teaching him how best to express his vigorous\r\nthoughts, as well as in strengthening his knowledge of Latin and\r\nGreek. According to the record preserved on his class certificates he\r\nworked attentively and diligently; but the mere fact that he did not\r\nexcel is sufficient proof that he did not make an attempt.\r\n\r\nDuring his Arts course Simpson lodged at No. 1, Adam Street, along\r\nwith the John Reid already mentioned, who was now a medical student,\r\nand with a Mr. MacArthur, who had been a junior master at the Bathgate\r\nschool, but had now also commenced to study medicine. MacArthur was a\r\nman of dogged determination; he urged Simpson to persist with his\r\nArts course when his spirit seemed to rebel against it, and so long as\r\nthey were together seems to have maintained some of the authority of\r\nthe usher over both of the youths. The spirit of work was strong\r\nwithin him. Soon after Simpson joined him he related that he could\r\nthen do with four hours' sleep, John Reid with six, but he had not\r\nbeen able to break in James yet. What MacArthur and the Arts course\r\ncould not do, however, the attraction of medicine accomplished without\r\neffort, and Simpson soon formed the habit of early rising.\r\n\r\nIt seems remarkable that so much study should have been required when,\r\ncompared with to-day, the science of the healing art was in but a\r\nrudimentary condition. The teachers of the day had, in spite of\r\nSydenham, a great regard for authority, and burdened their students\r\nwith much that is utterly unknown to the present generation, and, if\r\nknown, would be regarded as worthless. A very large part of the\r\ncurriculum consisted of practical and bedside work, so that book study\r\nwas necessarily left to the evening or early morning. All three\r\nstudents, moreover, were fired with ambition, and thirsted for\r\nsomething more than mere professional knowledge. MacArthur constantly\r\nurged on his two young friends, and foretold great things for them if\r\nonly they would work. When he afterwards heard of their successes he\r\nused to say, \"Yes, but _how_ they worked.\" Simpson became the\r\ngreatest living obstetrician, and Reid rose to be Professor of\r\nPhysiology in St. Andrew's University. MacArthur never became famous;\r\nhis name is known only because of the initial impetus which his\r\ninfluence gave to the professional careers of his two young friends.\r\n\r\nIn his close association with two such men as MacArthur and Reid,\r\nSimpson was again fortunate in his environment. The art of medicine\r\nwas also fortunate inasmuch as at the right moment the right\r\ninfluences were at work to direct his mind towards it. While occupied\r\nin mastering the laws of hexameter and iambic or in assimilating the\r\nprescribed portion of Virgil and Tacitus, he happily now and then,\r\nliving with two such enthusiastic medical students, got a taste of the\r\nmore stimulating study of things scientific--food which was more\r\nagreeable to his mental palate, more suited to his mental digestion.\r\nBy peeps into anatomical books, by little demonstrations of specimens\r\nin their lodgings, and by occasional visits to some of the lecture\r\nrooms or the wards of the Infirmary, his appetite was whetted for that\r\ngreat study of nature which his youthful training at Bathgate had\r\nprepared him for, and for which his mental constitution was specially\r\nadapted. One can picture the eagerness with which he would cast aside\r\nthe finished Greek or Latin essay and urge the not unwilling embryo\r\nprofessor to demonstrate a bone or lecture on an anatomical\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nSometimes as a special favour he was taken by Reid to hear one of the\r\nlectures of the notorious Robert Knox, the extra-academical teacher of\r\nanatomy, whose strong personality and unrivalled powers as a lecturer\r\nwere at that time attracting to Surgeon's Square hundreds of students,\r\nwhile Munro (Tertius) was mechanically repeating his grandfather's\r\nlectures from the University chair.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of 1828, when Simpson was just about commencing\r\nhis medical studies that Edinburgh, and in fact the whole of civilised\r\nEurope, was horrified by the revelation of the doings of Burke and\r\nHare, when they were at last brought to justice for the long series of\r\ncrimes perpetrated for the purpose of selling the bodies of their\r\nvictims to the anatomical schools. Knox having a class of some four\r\nhundred students had special difficulty in meeting the demand for\r\n\"subjects,\" and it was brought to light at the trial of Burke that the\r\nmajority of the bodies were disposed of to Knox. As was only natural,\r\na fierce indignation against Knox sprang up in the city. His residence\r\nwas assailed and his effigy burnt. His life was in danger at the hands\r\nof the mob on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\nLord Cockburn in his \"Memorials of His Time\" says that all the\r\nEdinburgh anatomists incurred an unjust and very alarming though not\r\nan unnatural odium--Dr. Knox in particular, against whom not only the\r\nanger of the populace but the condemnation of more intelligent\r\npersons was directed. \"But,\" he says, \"tried in reference to the\r\ninvariable and the necessary practice of the profession our anatomists\r\nwere spotlessly correct and Knox the most correct of them all.\"\r\n\r\nThese were stirring times in Edinburgh medical circles. The strong,\r\ncool demeanour of Knox under the persecutions to which he was\r\nsubjected, must have made an indelible impression on Simpson's mind,\r\nand the memory of it may have served to strengthen him in later years\r\nwhen himself subjected to the unjust accusations of thoughtless and\r\nignorant people.\r\n\r\nOne night when Knox had attracted a large class to hear him on a\r\nfavourite subject, the crowd in the street mustered in unusual force;\r\nthe yells and howls from outside were heard distinctly in the\r\nclass-room. The students got alarmed, and kept looking to the doors of\r\negress. Knox perceiving the restlessness and alarm of his audience\r\npaused, and then addressed to them reassuring words, expressing his\r\ncontempt for the cowardly mob, and reminding them of the great men who\r\nat different times had suffered persecution for the cause of their\r\nscience. His statement was received with such cheers as resounded\r\nbeyond the class-room walls and actually cowed the uproarious mob, so\r\nloudly did the students applaud the words of the man who, they knew,\r\ndaily placed his life in danger in order to lecture to them, and whose\r\nlast hour seemed to have come, so great and threatening was the crowd\r\non this particular evening.\r\n\r\nIf Simpson did not actually witness such a scene as the foregoing--he\r\nwas not a member of Knox's class until the session 1830-31--he must at\r\nleast have known full well about it at the time, and shared with the\r\nwhole body of students the worship of the man as a hero. His fellow\r\nlodger, Reid, was not only a distinguished pupil in Knox's class, but\r\nbecame one of Knox's demonstrators in 1833, and was always a prominent\r\nKnoxite. We know also that Knox went down to Bathgate to visit Reid's\r\nrelations there, so that it is justifiable to conclude that Simpson\r\ncame closely in contact with this remarkable teacher. That the\r\nrelationship between Reid and Simpson was most intimate we have the\r\nformer's own words for. At a public dinner given to him when appointed\r\nto his professorship in 1841, he said, \"In the croupier (Simpson) I\r\nrecognise my earliest friend, a native of the same village. We were\r\nrivals at school and at college. We stood to each other from boyhood\r\nupwards in every possible relation, whether of an educational,\r\nwarlike, delicate, or social character, which the warm and fitful\r\nfeelings peculiar to boyhood and youth can produce.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end Knox and Reid quarrelled over a scientific matter. Knox\r\nnever recovered from the effect of the Burke and Hare incident; in\r\nspite of the favourable report of an influential committee appointed\r\nto inquire into his share in the proceedings, and his own explicit\r\nstatements, the public never acquitted him of at least a wilful\r\nshutting of his eyes to much that ought to have aroused his\r\nsuspicions. His crowded class-room gradually became empty during the\r\nnext few years, and the once brilliant, talented, and determined man\r\nbecame demoralised and left Edinburgh. Christison says that Knox\r\nfinally died almost destitute in London, and that one of his last\r\noccupations was that of showman to a party of travelling Ojibbeway\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nHowever the strong personality and attractive lecturing of Knox may\r\nhave influenced him, it is undoubted that to the personal influence of\r\nMacArthur and Reid, acting upon his constant hunger to know nature and\r\ntruth, stimulated as it was by what he saw of anatomy and physiology,\r\nwe owe the fact that Simpson decided to enter the medical profession.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of medical students in Edinburgh University\r\nreached one of its highest points during the years that Simpson was a\r\nstudent, it is remarkable that with one, or perhaps two, exceptions,\r\nthe University professors were men of no marked eminence in their\r\nvarious subjects. On the other hand, the extra-mural teachers included\r\nmen of such wide reputation as Knox, Lizars, and Liston. Syme, who\r\nreached the height of his fame as a surgeon about the same time that\r\nSimpson became renowned, had just resigned the teaching of anatomy to\r\ntake up surgery; shut out at first from the wards of the Royal\r\nInfirmary by jealous colleagues, he was boldly establishing for\r\nhimself the little Minto House Hospital, which became the successful\r\nnursery of his own unsurpassed system of clinical teaching, and\r\nremains in the recollection to this day as the principal scene of Dr.\r\nJohn Brown's pathetic story, \"Rab and his Friends.\" It was chiefly\r\nthese extra-academical teachers who at that time made the medical\r\nschool famous, and were raising for it a reputation in surgery such as\r\nit had acquired in physic in the days of Cullen. In certain subjects\r\nthe students would, according to the regulations for the degree, take\r\nout their tickets of attendance on the professor's course of lectures,\r\nbut would put in only a sufficient number of appearances to entitle\r\nthem to the necessary certificates; the real study of the subject\r\nbeing made under the more accomplished teacher outside the University\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh was at this period much more than the scene of the foremost\r\nmedical and surgical teaching of the day in the world. It was a\r\nstriking centre of intellectual activity. Sir Walter Scott,\r\nCockburn, and Jeffrey were famous in literature and politics; Chalmers\r\nand Moncrieff in Church affairs; and Aytoun, John Wilson, Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton, and Sir David Brewster were names that attracted\r\nmen from far and wide to the modern Athens. English and foreign\r\nadvocates, scholars, artists, squires, and noblemen mingled together\r\nto hear or see some of these men. Lord John Russell, Henry\r\nTemple--subsequently Lord Palmerston--and Lord Melbourne were\r\namongst the young Englishmen who attended university classes for a\r\nsession or two; and H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, and his brother the\r\nDuke of Edinburgh, each matriculated in later days. When Simpson began\r\nhis studies Knox was the great lion, without a visit to whose\r\nclass-room no sojourn in Edinburgh was complete; just as in later\r\nyears Simpson's house in Queen Street was the resort of all sorts\r\nand conditions of distinguished people.\r\n\r\nThe University had little control over her students once they were\r\noutside the gates of the quadrangle. There were no residential\r\ncolleges; each youth found lodgings for himself suitable to his means,\r\nand led a perfectly independent life. So long as he conducted himself\r\nwith propriety within her walls his Alma Mater cared little how he\r\nconducted himself or how he fared outside. Before 1858, when the Town\r\nCouncil controlled University affairs, there were sometimes attempts\r\nto order the comings and goings of students. It is recorded that in\r\n1635 the Town Council discovered that the scholars of the College were\r\nmuch withdrawn from their studies by \"invitations to burials,\" which\r\n\"prejudiced their advancement in learning,\" and they enacted that no\r\nstudent was to be permitted to attend burials except those of\r\nUniversity or city worthies. This was at a time when some of the\r\nstudents were provided with residences inside the University, but by\r\nthe beginning of the eighteenth century College residence had ceased.\r\nFrom time to time attempts have been made to render the students\r\nconspicuous in the city by the wearing of red gowns, but without\r\nsuccess; and those of all faculties continue to be their own masters,\r\nin marked contrast to the mode of government in force at Oxford and\r\nCambridge. Recently, in the eighties, a batch of students who had\r\nfigured in the police-court after a riot in the gallery of a theatre\r\nwere surprised to find themselves summoned before the Senatus\r\nAcademicus and rusticated for varying periods; this, however, was but\r\na spasmodic exercise of power. The chief advantage claimed for this\r\ncustom of leaving the student to his own devices is that it encourages\r\nindependence and develops each man's individuality better than a\r\nsystem of discipline and control. In men of Simpson's calibre it\r\ncertainly has had a good effect.\r\n\r\nAlthough the family in Bathgate strained every nerve to keep James\r\nwell supplied with the necessary funds as a student, they were not\r\nable to place him in such a pecuniary position as to make it\r\nunnecessary for him to exercise economy: He appears to have been very\r\ncareful indeed of the money which he had; much more careful than when\r\nhe reckoned his income by thousands. He kept methodical accounts of\r\nhis expenses down to the most trivial items, and regularly submitted\r\nthem to his family. His cash-book opened with the following quotation\r\nfrom a small book called the \"Economy of Life,\" which figures at a\r\ncost of ninepence:--\"Let not thy recreations be expensive lest the\r\npain of purchasing them exceed the pleasure thou hast in their\r\nenjoyment\"; and to this he added:--\r\n\r\n  \"No trivial gain nor trivial loss despise;\r\n  Mole-hills, if often heaped, to mountains rise.\r\n  Weigh every small expense and nothing waste;\r\n  Farthings long saved amount to pounds at last.\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see here the imprint of a well-known national\r\ncharacteristic, from which, however, he completely shook himself free\r\nwhen prosperity came to him.\r\n\r\nHis share of the rent of the Adam Street lodging amounted to only\r\nthree shillings a week. The entries in the cash-book show how frugally\r\nhe lived and how every spare sum was devoted to the purchase of books.\r\nHis library, the foundation of much of his encyclopedic knowledge, was\r\na curious mixture. Adam's \"Antiquities,\" Milton's Poems, Byron's\r\n\"Giaour\" and \"Childe Harold,\" a Church Bible, Paley's \"Natural\r\nTheology,\" Fife's \"Anatomy,\" and \"The Fortunes of Nigel,\" were amongst\r\nthose entered as purchased. The daily entries were such as the\r\nfollowing:--\"Subject (anatomical), L2; spoon, 6d.; bread and tart, 1s.\r\n8d. Duncan's Therapeutics, 9d.; snuff; 1-1/2d.; Early Rising,\r\n9-1/2d.\"\r\n\r\nHe followed out the usual student's custom of the day of learning\r\ndispensing by serving for a time in a chemist's shop. The late Dr.\r\nKeiller, of Edinburgh, used to relate how, while he himself was so\r\nemployed in a chemist's shop in Dundas Street, one day \"a little\r\nfellow with a big head\" was brought in and entered as a pupil by a\r\nrelative. The little fellow was Simpson, and no sooner was he left in\r\nthe shop than he sat down with a book upon drugs, and turning to the\r\nshelves took down drug after drug to read up. The prompt industry of\r\nthe big-headed fellow deeply impressed Keiller.\r\n\r\nJames attended most of the University classes, but studied surgery\r\nunder the great Robert Liston, the foremost extra-mural surgeon,\r\ndaring and skilful as an operator and of great repute as a lecturer,\r\nwho afterwards filled the post of Professor of Clinical Surgery in\r\nUniversity College Hospital, London. Liston was an abrupt-mannered but\r\nsincere man, and a keen lover of truth. He was a warm advocate of\r\nhospital reform, and was successful in introducing several needed\r\nimprovements into the Royal Infirmary after a fierce fight. Here again\r\nSimpson was brought under the influence of a strong, self-reliant man\r\nwith a distinct tendency towards controversy; to whom he was also\r\nattracted by the fact that Liston was a native of Linlithgowshire.\r\nListon and Syme, after being close colleagues, quarrelled most\r\nfiercely, and were bitter rivals until Liston removed to London in\r\n1835. Simpson attended Liston's lectures during three sessions.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of his having obtained great distinction in any of\r\nthe medical classes, but his certificates show that he worked with\r\npre-eminent diligence in them all, and obtained a characteristic\r\nmastery of each subject. If any exception occurred it was in the very\r\nsubject in which he afterwards earned his greatest scientific\r\nfame--that of obstetrics. He attended Professor James Hamilton's\r\ncourse of lectures on that subject early in his career, and apparently\r\nfelt so little interest--the subject only became a compulsory one for\r\nexamination for qualification in 1830--that he regularly went to sleep\r\nduring the lecture. The excuse urged was that the lecture being a late\r\none, three to four in the afternoon, it found him tired out after a\r\nlong morning of study, lectures, and practical work. But had he been\r\nkeenly interested he would have been wide awake, for Hamilton was a\r\nforcible, if plain, lecturer.\r\n\r\nHamilton was another of Simpson's teachers who exhibited the same\r\nuncompromising fighting characteristics--eager and strenuous in his\r\nefforts to obtain some object--which Simpson himself afterwards\r\ndisplayed. He fought hard for fifteen years to gain recognition for\r\nthe subject which he taught, and to have it included in those\r\nnecessary for qualification. He succeeded in the end, but in the\r\ncourse of the struggle had to bring two actions at law against\r\nprofessional brethren. In one the defendant was Dr. Gregory, whose\r\nteaching was mainly responsible for the British system of medical\r\npractice in the early part of this century, viz., free purging,\r\nfree bleeding, and frequent blistering, and who was the inventor of\r\nthat well known household remedy, Gregory's powder. Gregory was also\r\na pugnacious man and could not abide the pretensions of the\r\nrepresentative of the despised art of midwifery; he administered a\r\npublic caning to him, and had to pay L100 in damages which, it is\r\nsaid, he offered to pay over again for another opportunity of\r\nthrashing the little obstetrician. This encounter occurred before\r\nSimpson became a student, but the memory of it was frequently\r\nrevived in the subsequent disputes which Hamilton carried on.\r\n\r\nThe notes which Simpson took of the curriculum lectures were concisely\r\nmade and full of comments, criticisms, and queries. He by no means\r\nbowed down to authority; he allowed nothing to pass which he did not\r\nunderstand at the time, and specially noted points which it seemed to\r\nhim his teachers themselves did not understand.\r\n\r\nLike most young men of his abilities and temperament, Simpson took\r\npleasure in rhyming, and some of his verses are preserved. They\r\nindicate something of the rollicking spirit of the medical student's\r\nlife seventy years ago. The medical student at that date has been\r\ndescribed in a recent interesting sketch of Edinburgh student life as\r\nwearing a white great-coat and talking loud; his hat was inclined\r\nknowingly to one side of his head, and the bright hues of an Oriental\r\nhandkerchief decorated his neck. There was a great deal of acting in\r\nhis motions. He was first at the door of the theatre on a Saturday\r\nnight, and regardless of the damages sustained by the skirts of his\r\ncoat, secured the very middle seat of the fifth row of benches in the\r\npit. Simpson, however, hardly conformed to this description. He\r\nenjoyed recreation as much as any man, and had a keen sense of humour\r\nwhich made him popular among his fellow students, but he was saturated\r\nwith the love of study and was not led into extravagances of the Bob\r\nSawyer type, or the harmless inanities of Albert Smith's immortal\r\nMedical Student.\r\n\r\nDuring the long summer vacation he noted carefully his observations on\r\nthe botany, zoology, geology, and even the meteorology of the Bathgate\r\ndistrict. Dr. Duns, in his memoir, points out that he was much more at\r\nhome with the phenomena of organic than with those of inorganic forms.\r\nHis highest powers came into play when he had to do with the presence\r\nof life and its varied manifestations. Even his antiquarian notes\r\nillustrated this. He passed at once from the things to the thoughts\r\nand feelings of the men associated with them.\r\n\r\nIn the holidays he also assisted the village doctor in visiting and\r\ndispensing, and lent a willing hand in his father's shop when he was\r\nwanted, often enough driving the baker's cart on the daily round of\r\nbread delivery.\r\n\r\nIn January of the year 1830 his father was taken seriously ill, and\r\nJames hastily left Edinburgh and tended him till his death. On his\r\nreturn he presented himself for the final examination at the College\r\nof Surgeons. This he passed with ease and credit in April, and found\r\nhimself a fully qualified medical practitioner at the age of\r\neighteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFURTHER STUDIES. 1830-1835\r\n\r\n  Applies for a village appointment--Disappointment--Brother's help\r\n  to further studies--Dispensary assistant--Obtains University M.D.,\r\n  1832--Thesis--Assistant to the Professor of Pathology--Turns to\r\n  obstetrics--Attends Professor Hamilton's lectures again--Royal\r\n  Medical and Royal Physical Societies--Edward Forbes--The\r\n  Oineromathic Society--Foreign tour--Visits Liverpool and meets\r\n  Miss Jessie Grindlay--His characteristics, principles, and\r\n  methods, with extracts from addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere now came the first crisis in Simpson's medical career. After\r\nhis father's death he felt that having obtained his qualification\r\nto practise it was his duty to relieve his family of the burden of\r\nsupporting him through more extended studies. After due deliberation\r\nhe applied for a small appointment which would have served as a\r\nnucleus for private practice, that of parish surgeon to a small\r\nvillage on the banks of the Clyde. Those in whose hands the\r\nappointment lay were not impressed with his fitness for the post,\r\nand he was not elected, \"I felt,\" he afterwards said, \"a deeper\r\namount of chagrin and disappointment than I have ever experienced\r\nsince that date. If chosen, I would probably have been working there\r\nas a village doctor still.\" Although such a commencement might have\r\ndelayed his ultimate rise to eminence, it cannot be agreed that it\r\ncould possibly have prevented it. It was at this crisis that what he\r\ntenderly referred to as \"the ceaseless love and kindness of a dear\r\nelder brother\" came to his rescue, and by Alexander's or, as he\r\naffectionately called him, \"Sandy's\" help, he returned to Edinburgh\r\nto resume his studies in the winter session, 1830-31. His other\r\nbrother, David, had started in business as a baker at Stockbridge,\r\nclose to Edinburgh, and James boarded with him there for a time.\r\nHis qualification enabled him to become assistant to a Dr. Gairdner\r\nin dispensary practice, a class of work he had had some experience of\r\nin the previous year while staying with Dr. Girdwood at Falkirk during\r\nthe summer. Dr. Gairdner was much struck with Simpson's abilities,\r\nwhich he stated, \"promised the most flattering expectations.\" In the\r\ncourse of his first experiences of actual practice he became\r\nimpressed with the necessity for a knowledge of obstetrics, and\r\ntherefore attended lectures on the subject by Dr. Thatcher, an\r\nextra-mural teacher of repute, who subsequently applied for the\r\nUniversity chair of midwifery when Simpson was the successful\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nHis chief object, however, was to qualify for the degree of Doctor\r\nof Medicine of the University, and this he succeeded in doing in\r\n1832. The regulations for this coveted degree were, for the times,\r\nwonderfully complete; it was held in such high estimation and such\r\nlarge numbers qualified annually--in 1827 there were one hundred and\r\nsixty graduates--that the authorities felt justified in being\r\nstringent. The length of the course of study necessary for graduation\r\nhad been fixed at four years, and required the candidate to have\r\nattended classes in Anatomy, Surgery, Materia Medica, and Pharmacy,\r\nthe Theory and Practice of Medicine, Clinical Medicine, Midwifery,\r\nChemistry, and Botany, as well as a three months' course in any two\r\nof the following:--Practical Anatomy, Natural History, Medical\r\nJurisprudence, Clinical Surgery, and Military Surgery. The first\r\nstep in examination took place at the house of one of the professors\r\nwhere the candidate was questioned in literary subjects, chiefly\r\nLatin, and in the different branches of Medicine and Surgery. If he\r\npassed this satisfactorily he was examined more minutely by two\r\nprofessors in the presence of the others, and was subsequently given\r\ntwo Aphorisms of Hippocrates to explain and illustrate in writing and\r\nto defend before the faculty, as well as two cases with questions\r\nattached. The last step was the presenting of a thesis which was\r\nread by one of the faculty and was publicly defended by the\r\ncandidate on the day of graduation. All this examination was\r\nconducted in Latin. Simpson's thesis was entitled: \"_De causa\r\nmortis in quibusdam inflammationibus proxima_.\" He was amongst the\r\nlast graduates who were examined through the medium of Latin, for\r\nafter 1833 the language was optional, and English soon became the\r\nonly one used; at the same time the examinations were differently\r\narranged, and made to consist of more thorough and prolonged written\r\nand oral stages. Being on a pathological subject, Simpson's thesis\r\nwas allotted to Thomson, the professor of Pathology, to examine,\r\nwho not only recommended the author for the degree, but was so\r\nimpressed by the ability displayed in the dissertation that he sought\r\nhim out and promptly offered him the post of assistant, which\r\nSimpson as promptly accepted. This appointment was most welcome. Not\r\nonly did it give him a much desired opportunity for pathological work,\r\nbut the salary of L50 a year enabled him to free his family from\r\nthe immediate necessity of supporting him.\r\n\r\nIf to MacArthur and John Reid was due the credit of first directing\r\nSimpson's thoughts to the study of medicine, to Professor John Thomson\r\nbelongs the credit of having made him an obstetrician. \"At Dr.\r\nThomson's earnest suggestion and advice,\" says Simpson, \"I first\r\nturned more especially to the study of midwifery with the view of\r\nbecoming a teacher of this department of medical science.\" He lost no\r\ntime in throwing himself heartily into the work that was nearest to\r\nhim, and became almost indispensable to his chief. Most of his time\r\nwas spent in the Pathological Museum, busily engaged in arranging,\r\nclassifying, and describing the preparations, but he also assisted in\r\npreparing the professor's lectures. He took up more readily than\r\nThomson the then new mode of study by the microscope, and it is\r\nrelated that once he composed a lecture for his chief on this subject\r\nwhich Thomson delivered without previous perusal. Several times as\r\nThompson read the lecture to the class he looked up to glare at his\r\nassistant, and when they returned to the side room he shook his fist\r\nin his face, saying, \"I don't believe one d--d word of it.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Simpson was now earning enough by his salary as assistant to\r\nmeet his expenses at the time, his family maintained their loving\r\ninterest in his welfare. His sister told him he was working too hard\r\nand hurting his health. \"Well,\" he replied, \"I am sure it is just to\r\nplease you all.\"\r\n\r\nSandy, who had married in 1832, watched his career carefully, and when\r\nthe cholera made its appearance in Scotland he made a will with a\r\nprovision for \"my dear James\" in the event of his death. \"I daresay,\"\r\nhe addressed his family therein, \"every one of you has a pleasure in\r\ndoing him good by stealth as I have had myself.\"\r\n\r\nBy Thomson's advice Simpson attended Hamilton's lectures in the winter\r\nsession 1833-4, and this time with awakened interest. With the\r\ndefinite object of devoting himself to Midwifery clearly in view\r\nSimpson worked with all his phenomenal energy during the years from\r\n1832 to 1835, studying the subject while he was helping Thomson. He\r\nentered the front rank of the young graduates of his day, and was\r\nelected a member of the Royal Medical and Royal Physical Societies in\r\nthe same year, 1833. Both these societies were for the encouragement\r\nof scientific study and discussion among students and young graduates,\r\nand to obtain the Presidential chair of either was a high honour. The\r\nRoyal Medical Society was the oldest Society in the University, having\r\nbeen established in 1737 by the great Cullen and others; it had always\r\nbeen of great account in the University, and the originality of the\r\nutterances on professional matters which emanated from it made it then\r\na power to be reckoned with not only in Edinburgh, but throughout\r\nEuropean professional circles. For membership of the Royal Physical\r\nSociety he was proposed by Edward Forbes, a brilliant youth, who\r\nsubsequently distinguished himself in Natural History, and held the\r\nUniversity Chair in that subject for a brief period until cut down\r\nprematurely at the age of thirty-nine. Forbes was the leader of a set\r\nof able young students who have left a distinct mark in the history of\r\nthe University. John Reid was an intimate friend of Forbes, and\r\nSimpson was probably as intimate with him. Forbes was the founder and\r\neditor of the best of all the shortlived literary ventures of\r\nEdinburgh undergraduates--_The University Maga_, which was issued\r\nweekly in 1834; and he was also one of the founders of the\r\nOineromathic Society, \"The brotherhood of the friends of Truth.\"\r\nForbes thus described the nature of this Society in song:--\r\n\r\n  \"Some love to stray through lands far away,\r\n    Some love to roam on the sea,\r\n  But an antique cell and a college bell,\r\n    And a student's life for me.\r\n  For palace or cot, for mead or grot\r\n    I never would care or pine,\r\n  But spend my days in twining lays\r\n    To Learning, Love, and Wine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wine, Love, and Learning\" was the motto of this curious brotherhood,\r\nand it numbered in its membership many men of the day, who afterwards\r\nbecame eminent, such as Forbes himself, Reid, George Wilson, Goodsir,\r\nand Bennet. Simpson must have been quite cognisant of this Society's\r\ndoings; he was closely associated with its leaders, but his name does\r\nnot appear in any of the lists of members still preserved. His\r\nwhole-hearted devotion to the ~MATHESIS~ probably prevented his\r\nuniting with the brotherhood to worship the ~EROS~ and ~OINOS~. The\r\nbrotherhood was conspicuously united. In the great snowball riot of\r\n1837, which was quelled only by the reading of the Riot Act and the\r\nmarching down at the double from the Castle of the Cameron Highlanders\r\ninto the University gates, they fought shoulder to shoulder.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 Simpson felt that the time had come to enter into serious\r\npractice and turn his acquired knowledge to account. Fifty pounds a\r\nyear was no large income on which to satisfy his craving for\r\nlearning, and there was no surplus from which by any means to repay\r\nhis family for their assistance. Before taking any decided step,\r\nhowever, he desired to pay a visit to the Continental centres of\r\nmedical science and teaching. The funds for the proposed tour were\r\npromptly found by his brothers Alexander and John; by their assistance\r\nhe was enabled to visit Paris, Liege, and Brussels, as well as London\r\nand Oxford. He was accompanied by Dr. (now Sir Douglas) Maclagan, and\r\nkept a journal of the tour, which is an interesting example of his\r\nlively powers of observation. In London he visited the leading\r\nhospitals, and made the acquaintance of the leading physicians and\r\nsurgeons, amongst whom were many _alumni_ of his own _alma mater_. In\r\nthe journal he freely and concisely criticised the men, their methods,\r\nand their hospitals. In Paris he followed the same plan, going the\r\nround of all the hospitals, and searching for and grasping the\r\nprinciple which guided each distinguished man's thought and teaching.\r\nHe took more than a medical interest in all that he saw, and noted the\r\nappearance and habits of the people of each place that he visited. At\r\nthe end of his coach ride from London to Southampton, on the way to\r\nParis, he sat down to write:--\"The ride as far as Windsor Park was\r\ndelightful, and from the top of the coach we had two or three most\r\nlovely glimpses of English scenery. After passing Windsor the soil was\r\nrather inferior in many parts, and we passed every now and then large\r\ntracts of heath.... The neatness and cleanliness of the English\r\ncottages is greatly superior to all that we have in Scotland; the\r\nlittle patches of garden ground before, behind, and around them set\r\nthem off amazingly. I wish the Scottish peasantry could by some means\r\nor other be excited to a little more love of cleanliness and\r\nhorticulture. I did not see above two or three dirty windows, men or\r\nwomen along the whole line of road. The snow-white smock-frocks of the\r\nHampshire peasantry do actually look well in my opinion.\"\r\n\r\nAt Liege on June 13th he wrote:--\"And is it possible that I here begin\r\na second volume of a journal?... I began my journal chiefly with some\r\ndistant prospect of teaching myself the important lesson of daily\r\nnotation. I am vain enough to flatter myself now that I have partly at\r\nleast succeeded. At all events that which was at first a sort of task,\r\nat times rather an annoying task, has now become to me a pleasure. If\r\nI had my first volume to write over again I think I would now write it\r\ntwenty times better. In writing a journal 'tis needless to think of\r\nmaking no blunders in the way of blots and bad grammar or of crooked\r\nsentences. We, or at least I, have occasionally felt so confoundedly\r\ntired at night that if I had been obliged to attend to such minutiae I\r\ncertainly would not have been able to advance above two sentences.\r\n\r\n\"This morning rose by half-past seven--dressed and breakfasted on\r\ncoffee and rolls, read the _Liege Courier_, and by nine o'clock called\r\non Professor Fohman with a copy of Dr. Reid's paper on the glands of\r\nthe whale, which I had promised him yesterday. The Professor kept us\r\nuntil five minutes to ten, lecturing us on his discoveries upon the\r\noriginal elementary tubular structure of animal tissues. Somebody has\r\nremarked that no person ever entered into or at least came out of the\r\nstudy of the Book of Revelation without being either mad before or mad\r\nafter it. I would not choose to say that Dr. F.'s case is perfectly\r\nanalogous, but has it not some analogy? He seems to run wild on\r\nelementary tubular texture; ... he hates Lippi and his researches with\r\na perfect hatred. Lippi has been preferred to him by the Parisian\r\nAcademy. Is he not working against Lippi, and it may be against truth,\r\nif they happen to go together, which I do not believe?\r\n\r\n\"We have taken our seats in the diligence to-morrow for Louvain, and\r\non leaving Liege I must confess that I leave one of the most lovely\r\nplaces I have seen on the Continent. 'Tis rich, populous, busy; the\r\ntown in itself is old and good, though not so neat and clean as Mons;\r\nits environs wild and romantic. Besides it seems full of good-natured\r\n_gash_ old wives, and sonsy, laughing-faced, good-looking, nay, some\r\nof them very good-looking girls.\"\r\n\r\nThe homeward journey was made _via_ Birmingham, Liverpool, and\r\nGlasgow. In Liverpool he called upon a distant relative named\r\nGrindlay, established there as a shipper, and laid the foundation of a\r\nlife-long friendship with the family. He also then for the first time\r\nmet Miss Jessie Grindlay who afterwards became his wife.\r\n\r\nWith the end of this tour, Simpson brought to a close the more\r\nstrictly student part of his career, although it remained true of\r\nhim, as of all eminent scientific men, that he was a student to the\r\nend of his days. He felt himself now fully equipped to enter into\r\nthe professional battle, and he stepped into the arena, not only\r\nfull of vigorous life and hope, but possessed of highly trained\r\nfaculties, keen senses, and lofty ideals. It was his strong,\r\npersonal characteristics, apart from his accomplishments, which at\r\nonce placed him head and shoulders above his fellows. \"He had a great\r\nheart,\" says a recent writer, \"and a marvellous personal influence,\r\ncalling forth, not only the sympathy and love of his fellowmen,\r\nbut capable of kindling enthusiasm in others almost at first\r\nsight.\" It is impossible to overestimate this personal influence in\r\nanalysing the elements of his ultimate success, and it is more\r\nimpossible for those who did not feel it to realise its nature; but\r\nthat he became the beloved as well as the trusted physician is due to\r\nthis influence. \"He had no acquaintances,\" says the writer already\r\nquoted; \"none could come into contact with him and stop short of\r\nfriendship.\" This was a powerful trait to possess; it cannot be\r\ndenied that he was fully aware of it and its value; and used it with\r\ngood effect in establishing himself as the greatest physician of his\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAs a scientist he started with an eager desire for knowledge and\r\nreverence for truth, to which was added the highly developed power of\r\nmental concentration born of early self-training. When most men would\r\nbe waiting in what they would term enforced idleness, Simpson would be\r\nbusy with book or pen, deeply attentive to his occupation despite\r\nsurrounding distractions or temptations to frivolous idleness. He took\r\nthe full measure of the value of Time and handled his moments as\r\nanother would a precious metal. \"At all times,\" he said himself, \"on\r\nall occasions, and amidst the numerous disturbing influences to which\r\nthe medical man is so constantly subjected, he should be able to\r\ncontrol and command his undivided mental attention to the case or\r\nobject that he may have before him.... In the power of concentrating\r\nand keeping concentrated all the energies of attention and thought\r\nupon any given subject, consists the power of thinking strongly and\r\nsuccessfully upon that subject. The possession or the want of this\r\nquality of the mind constitutes the main distinction between the\r\npossession or the want of what the world designates 'mental abilities\r\nand talents.'\"\r\n\r\nHis high ideals, his conception of the functions of the physician,\r\nand the strivings of the scientist are best shown in his own\r\nwords:--\"Other pursuits become insignificant in their objects when\r\nplaced in contrast with ours. The agriculturist bestows all his\r\nprofessional care and study on the rearing of crops and cattle; the\r\nmerchant spends his energies and attention on his goods and his\r\ncommissions; the engineer upon his iron-wheels and rails; the sailor\r\nupon his ships and freights; the banker upon his bills and his\r\nbonds; and the manufacturer upon his spindles and their products. But\r\nwhat after all are machinery and merchandise, shares and stocks,\r\nconsols and prices-current, or the rates of cargoes and cattle, of\r\ncorns and cottons, in comparison with the inestimable value and\r\nimportance of the very lives of these fellowmen who everywhere move\r\nand breath and speak and act around us? What are any, or what are all\r\nthese objects when contrasted with the most precious and valued gift\r\nof God--human life? And what would not the greatest and most\r\nsuccessful followers of such varied callings give out of their own\r\nprofessional stores for the restoration of health and for the\r\nprolongation of life--if the first were once lost to them, or if\r\nthe other were merely menaced by the dreaded and blighting finger of\r\ndisease?\"\r\n\r\nIn one of his addresses of later years he urged upon his students the\r\nobjects and motives which had been his in early professional\r\nlife:--\"The objects and powers of your art are alike great and\r\nelevated,\" he said. \"Your aim is as far as possible to alleviate\r\nhuman suffering and lengthen out human existence. Your ambition is to\r\ngladden as well as to prolong the course of human life by warding off\r\ndisease as the greatest of mortal evils; and restoring health, and\r\neven at times reason itself, as the greatest of mortal blessings....\r\nIf you follow these, the noble objects of your profession, in a proper\r\nspirit of love and kindness to your race, the pure light of\r\nbenevolence will shed around the path of your toils and labours the\r\nbrightness and beauty that will ever cheer you onwards and keep your\r\nsteps from being weary in well-doing; ... while if you practise the\r\nart that you profess with a cold-hearted view to its results, merely\r\nas a matter of lucre and trade, your course will be as dark and\r\nmiserable as that low and grovelling love that dictates it.\"\r\n\r\nSimpson's method of study was simple, at the same time that it\r\ninvolved immense labour. In entering upon a new work his first\r\nproceeding was to ascertain conscientiously all that had already been\r\nsaid or written by others upon the subject. He traced knowledge from\r\nits earliest sources and was able, as he followed the mental workings\r\nof those who had preceded him, to estimate the value of every vaunted\r\naddition to the sum of knowledge; and to weigh the theories and new\r\nopinions of men which had been evolved with the progress of time, and\r\nwhich had sometimes obscured, instead of casting greater light upon\r\nthe truth. His antiquarian tastes added to his knowledge of Latin\r\nhelped him in this work and turned a tedious task into a real\r\npleasure. This preliminary accomplished, he plunged into the work of\r\nadding to the knowledge of the subject by thought, research,\r\nexperiment, or invention.\r\n\r\nIn writing upon an abstract subject he would disentangle the confused\r\nthoughts of his predecessors and restate their opinions in direct and\r\nsimplified language. But matters of opinion never had such an\r\nattraction for him as matters of fact; in dealing with these latter he\r\nwould test by experiment the statements of authorities and correct or\r\nadd to them by his own researches. Most of his professional writings,\r\nas well as his archaeological works, are valuable for the historical\r\n_resume_ of the knowledge on the subject as well as for his additions.\r\nHis later writings show as careful an attention to the inductive\r\nmethod with which he started, as those produced in the days of his\r\nmore youthful enthusiasm; when fame was attained and fortune secured,\r\nwhen excessive work was sapping his physical strength, he never sank\r\ninto lazy or slovenly methods in scientific work, but ever threw his\r\nwhole vigour into the self-imposed task.\r\n\r\nWhen studying Nature directly he was constantly asking her \"why?\"--just\r\nas in his notes of his teacher's lectures the query was ever recurring.\r\nHe never felt himself beaten by an initial failure, but returned again\r\nand again with his questions with renewed energy each time. He was not\r\nto be denied, and in this manner he wrested from Nature some of\r\nthose precious secrets the knowledge of which has relieved suffering and\r\nprolonged human life in every corner of the globe. \"He never kept\r\nanything secret,\" says his nephew and successor, Professor A. R.\r\nSimpson, \"that he thought could help his fellows, and it is hard to\r\nsay whether his delight was greater in finding some new means to cure\r\ndisease, or in demonstrating to others his methods of treatment.\"\r\n\r\nHe was indeed clothed in well-nigh impenetrable armour, and provided\r\nwith powerful weapons, when in the autumn of 1835 he returned from his\r\nforeign tour to commence the serious fight in which his avowed object\r\nwas not only to obtain professional eminence, but to stand forth a\r\nproud benefactor of the human race. Although he appealed always\r\ndirectly to Nature and used his own well-trained eyes and ears in\r\npreference to those of others, he did not completely brush aside\r\nauthority as Sydenham had done; he hesitated neither to extract all\r\nthat was valuable, nor to discard what appeared worthless from the\r\nwritings of past masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEARLY PRACTICE AND PROFESSORSHIP. 1835-1840\r\n\r\n  President of Royal Medical Society--Personal appearance--Practice\r\n  among the poor--Corresponds with Miss Grindlay--Lecturer on\r\n  obstetrics--Resignation of Professor Hamilton--Applies for\r\n  vacancy--Active candidature--Strong opposition--Marriage--Account\r\n  of the midwifery Chair--The medical professors at the time--Their\r\n  opposition--Cost of candidature--Triumphant election.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn November, 1835, Simpson was elected one of the annual Presidents of\r\nthe Royal Medical Society; a position which has been occupied by many\r\nyoung Edinburgh graduates, who have subsequently risen to fame. He\r\ntook pains to make his inaugural address worthy of the occasion, and\r\nchose a subject connected with the pathology of obstetrics. It was a\r\ngreat success, and contributed largely towards giving him a recognised\r\nposition as an authority in that branch of study. After appearing in\r\nthe _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal_ for January, 1836, it was\r\ntranslated into French, Italian, and German. It also obtained for him\r\nhis first foreign honour--one of a long list that was made up through\r\nhis lifetime--that of corresponding member of the Ghent Medical\r\nSociety; indeed, his early works received more attention and\r\nappreciation abroad than at home. In 1836, in order to widen his\r\nexperience in his chosen subject, he filled the post of house-surgeon\r\nto the Lying-in Hospital, and held it for twelve months. He was also\r\nelected a Fellow of the Edinburgh College of Physicians. From this\r\ntime he became a profuse writer on professional subjects, and\r\ndeveloped an easy and convincing style; he carried on this work _pari\r\npassu_ with practice amongst the poorer classes of the city and in\r\naddition to his work in connection with the Pathology Chair, always\r\nkeeping in view his great object of becoming an obstetrician. It was\r\nnot until 1838 that he became an independent lecturer on Midwifery. He\r\nhad intended to do so earlier, but owing to Professor Thomson's\r\nill-health, he had been called upon to act as Deputy-Professor of\r\nPathology, a most valuable and useful employment.\r\n\r\nSimpson's personal appearance at this time has been described by one\r\nwho visited a meeting of the Royal Medical Society on an evening when\r\nhe was in the chair:--\"The chair was occupied,\" says the narrator, \"by\r\na young man whose appearance was striking and peculiar. As we entered\r\nthe room his head was bent down, and little was seen but a mass of\r\nlong tangled hair, partially concealing what appeared to be a head of\r\nvery large size. He raised his head, and his countenance at once\r\nimpressed us. A pale, rather flattish face, massive brent brows, from\r\nunder which shone eyes now piercing as it were to your inmost soul,\r\nnow melting into almost feminine tenderness; a coarsish nose with\r\ndilated nostrils, finely chiselled mouth which seemed the most\r\nexpressive feature of the face ... Then his peculiar rounded soft body\r\nand limbs, as if he had retained the infantine form in adolescence,\r\npresented a _tout ensemble_, which even if we had never seen it again\r\nwould have remained indelibly impressed on our memory.\"\r\n\r\nIn Simpson's youth physicians and surgeons made a habit of cultivating\r\npeculiarities of appearances and behaviour, but he was so shaped by\r\nnature as to attract attention without artificial aid. The growth of\r\nlong hair seemed a natural accompaniment to his massive head and broad\r\nexpressive countenance.\r\n\r\nHis practice at this time was scattered over the city, and he took\r\nlong tramps in the course of the day. In one of his letters to his\r\nbrothers, who were still loyally supporting him in his increasingly\r\nsuccessful endeavours to establish himself after his heart's desire,\r\nhe says:--\"The patients are mostly poor it is true, but still they are\r\npatients; ... if my health is spared me, I do hope I may get into\r\npractice sufficient to keep me respectable after the lapse of years;\r\nbut I know years must pass before that. At present I enjoy the best\r\npossible spirits and health, and with all my toils was never happier\r\nor healthier.\"\r\n\r\n_Tout vient a point a qui sait attendre._ Simpson knew how to wait; he\r\nknew that waiting did not mean inactivity. Every opportunity that\r\narose for advancement found him prepared to take full advantage of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThat his lectures on pathology were acceptable was made manifest by\r\nthe address presented to him by the students of the class at the end\r\nof his temporary term of office, testifying to his zeal, fidelity, and\r\nsuccess, their admiration of his high talents, of the varied and\r\nextensive research which he displayed, and of his uniform and kind\r\naffability which, while it exalted him in the eyes of all as a\r\nteacher, endeared him to each as a friend.\r\n\r\nDuring this period he kept up a correspondence with the Miss Grindlay,\r\nof Liverpool, whose appearance he had been struck with when he visited\r\nthe family, and towards the end of 1837 he found time to visit there\r\nagain accompanied by Dr. John Reid.\r\n\r\nThe way for his appearance as an extra-academical lecturer on\r\nmidwifery was made clear at the end of 1837 by the death of Dr.\r\nMacintosh, a successful teacher of that subject. He had been in\r\nnegotiation, without success, with this Dr. Macintosh for the taking\r\nover of the part or whole of his lectures, and found it easy to step\r\nat once into his place at his death. He was firmly determined to\r\nsucceed ultimately to the University Chair of Midwifery. On one\r\noccasion he pointed out to some friends the then holder of the Chair,\r\nProfessor Hamilton, thus:--\"Do you see that old gentleman? Well,\r\nthat's my gown!\"\r\n\r\nThe good luck which had been his during his boyhood did not desert him\r\nwhen he began his course of lectures; for not only did he speedily\r\nattain a reputation for teaching, science, and practical skill,\r\nwonderful for one so young, but he had not two years to wait after\r\nthus establishing himself before the chair of his ambition fell vacant\r\nowing to the resignation in 1839 of Professor Hamilton, who died soon\r\nafterwards at the age of seventy-two.\r\n\r\nIt was a bold step for so young a man--for Simpson was only\r\ntwenty-eight--to apply for the professorship. He was, however, not\r\nwithout his precedent. The second Monro obtained the Anatomy Chair at\r\ntwenty-five, Alison filled that of Physic at thirty, and Thomas Hope\r\nand Alexander Christison were Professors of Chemistry and Medical\r\nJurisprudence respectively each at the age of twenty-four. But this\r\nsubject was one which was popularly thought to require a man of\r\nexperience and especially a married man. Simpson had devoted his\r\nenergies but partially to midwifery for only four or five years, and\r\nexcept for his short hospital appointment and recent experience as a\r\nlecturer on the subject had in the eyes of many no greater claim to\r\nthe post than any other general practitioner, except in the fact that\r\nhe had obtained a wide reputation in the science of the subject by\r\nhis contribution to its literature and his researches. This last was\r\nthe point on which he himself most relied; for his age he had done\r\nmore scientifically than any of his opponents. Those who had watched\r\nhis career knew that he possessed in addition to zeal and ability,\r\nbrilliant teaching and practical powers. The objection of his youth\r\nwas less easily got over than that of his unmarried state. With\r\ncharacteristic promptness, as soon as he had determined to apply for\r\nthe Chair and found that as a bachelor his chances would be small, he\r\ndisappeared for a time from Edinburgh, and returned triumphantly with\r\nMiss Jessie Grindlay, of Liverpool, as his wife. It was a bold stroke\r\nwhich delighted his supporters, discomfited his opponents, who saw\r\ntherein the removal of a barrier to his success and a weapon from\r\ntheir hands, and astonished the worthy town councillors in whose gift\r\nthe appointment lay.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh Chair of Midwifery was established in 1726, and was\r\nindisputably the first Chair of its kind in the British Islands, and\r\nprobably in the world. It was in that year that the Town Council first\r\nestablished the medical faculty, by appointing two Professors of the\r\nTheory and Practice of Medicine and two of Medicine and Chemistry. A\r\nChair of Anatomy had been instituted six years earlier through the\r\ninstrumentality of the first Monro who became its first occupant.\r\nThese five chairs were considered sufficient wherewith to teach all\r\nthe medical knowledge of the day, and although appointed _ad vitam\r\naut culpam_ the professors received no remuneration out of the city\r\nrevenues. The Chair was not reckoned at first as a faculty Chair, but\r\nwas termed a city professorship. The newly created medical faculty\r\nwould have no midwifery within the precincts of the University; and\r\nthis is scarcely surprising when we remember that at first the only\r\npersons lectured to by the city professor were women of an inferior\r\nclass in whose hands the practice of the art almost entirely lay.\r\n\r\nAlong with this appointment the Town Council established a system of\r\nregulation for midwifery practice within the city. It ordered that all\r\nmidwives already in practice should at once be registered, and that no\r\npersons should thereafter enter on the practice within the city until\r\nthey had presented to the magistrate a certificate under the hands of\r\nat least one doctor and one surgeon who were at the same time members\r\nof the College of Physicians or of the Incorporation of Chirurgeons,\r\nbearing that they had so much of the knowledge and principles of this\r\nart as warranted their entering on the practice of it; whereupon a\r\nlicence should be given them signed by four magistrates at least\r\nentitling them to practise. It was further enacted that certain pains\r\nand penalties were to be inflicted upon ignorant persons for\r\npractising without this licence whereby their \"want of skill might be\r\nof such dangerous consequences to the lives of so many people.\" It is\r\nto be presumed that as qualified medical men granted them these\r\ncertificates and that these women had extensive practices, they\r\npossessed also a fair amount of skill. But slowly and gradually they\r\nhad to give way and retire to the rank of nurses before the rise and\r\ngrowing public tolerance of the qualified male practitioner of\r\nobstetrics.\r\n\r\nThe second occupant of the chair, appointed in 1739, was elevated to a\r\nplace in the medical faculty, but Professor Thomas Young, who occupied\r\nit in 1756, was the first to teach the subject to medical students by\r\nmeans of lectures and clinical instruction. As already noted, it was\r\nleft for James Hamilton to obtain the recognition of midwifery as a\r\nsubject, a knowledge of which was necessary for the obtaining of the\r\nUniversity medical degree.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Simpson was straining every nerve to gain the post he\r\ncoveted, the medical faculty of the University comprised the following\r\nprofessors of the following subjects:--Botany, Robert Graham, who\r\nestablished the Edinburgh and Glasgow Botanical Gardens; Anatomy,\r\nMonro the third; Chemistry, Hope, who discovered strontium in the lead\r\nmines of Argyleshire; Institutes of Medicine, Alison, an eminent\r\nphysician and philanthropist who first pointed out the connection\r\nbetween destitution and epidemics of disease, and secured improved\r\nPoor Laws for his country; Practice of Physic, James Home; Materia\r\nMedica, Christison, the world-reputed toxicologist; Natural History,\r\nRobert Jameson; Clinical Surgery, James Syme, the wonderful operator\r\nand teacher, and inventor of the \"macintosh\" waterproof; Military\r\nSurgery, Ballingall; Medical Jurisprudence, Traill; Pathology,\r\nThomson; and Surgery, Charles Bell, the discoverer of the double\r\nfunction of the nerves, who was ranked in his day on the Continent as\r\ngreater than Harvey. It was thus not an undistinguished body that\r\nSimpson strove to enter; several of the best-known members were\r\ncomparatively young men, recently appointed to their posts, and full\r\nof the rising scientific spirit. It is little to their credit that\r\nthey were practically unanimous in opposing the candidature of this\r\nyoung and enthusiastic scientist, who afterwards shed such lustre on\r\nthe University from the chair which they would have denied him for no\r\nreasons other than his youth and his humble origin.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Simpson and for the University, the appointment did\r\nnot lie in the gift of the professors, but was entirely in the hands\r\nof the Town Council, comprising thirty-three citizens.\r\n\r\nSuch an election was always a matter of keen interest to the\r\ninhabitants of Edinburgh, and each candidate brought all the direct\r\nand indirect influence within his power to bear on every councillor\r\nwhom he could reach. The Professors in the various faculties had no\r\ndoubt great influence; they openly canvassed for the candidate they\r\nfavoured, and did not hesitate to decry those they did not approve of.\r\nShortsighted as this professorial opposition was, it proved no small\r\ndifficulty in Simpson's way. Foremost amongst his opponents was Syme,\r\nwho commenced a long feud with him by supporting his chief rival, Dr.\r\nKennedy; \"I feel no hesitation in stating,\" he wrote purposely for\r\npublication, \"that of all the candidates in the field, he (Kennedy) is\r\nout of all question, according to my judgment, the one that ought to\r\nbe elected.\" Sir Charles Bell was equally emphatic, and characterised\r\nSimpson's testimonials, in a note which Kennedy circulated, as given\r\nby \"good-natured people merely to do a civil thing to a friend\"--which\r\nwas his mode of describing the declarations of some of the most\r\neminent men of the day.\r\n\r\nEach candidate also brought political influence to bear, and Whig and\r\nTory grew agitated as the contest became keener. Simpson seems to have\r\nthought that both political parties were in opposition to him, but he\r\ncertainly had the strong support of Ritchie of _Scotsman_ fame, and\r\nthe no less important influence of Mr. Duncan Maclaren.\r\n\r\nWhen writing to ask Mr. Grindlay for his daughter's hand, Simpson\r\ncandidly confessed his pecuniary position at the time. He referred to\r\na debt of L200 already owing to his brother Sandy, and added:--\"Again\r\nhe gave me a bill for L120 to assist me in furnishing my house. This\r\nhas been renewed and becomes due in January. He hopes to be able to\r\npay it, and I fondly imagined I would have paid the half, but this\r\ncanvass has involved me in new difficulties, and besides, I have\r\nendeavoured to assist my sister to go out to Van Diemen's Land. As it\r\nis now I am self-sufficient enough to think that I am as well off as\r\nregards station in my profession as any who started here in the race\r\nof life with me. They have all, I believe, been aided by friends or by\r\nprivate wealth. They have almost all been fortunate enough to have the\r\nprotection of a father's roof during the first years of practice. I\r\nhave had no such advantages, but have worked and stood alone. I have\r\naccumulated for myself a library and museum, worth L200 at least,\r\namidst these difficulties. These I have won by my pen and my lancet,\r\nand these are my only fortune. And now could you trust her future\r\nhappiness to me under such circumstances? I did not intend to ask her\r\nhand at present. I fondly hoped I might have _first_ cleared myself of\r\nmy debts.\"\r\n\r\nGrindlay did not hesitate, but willingly gave his daughter, as she was\r\nwillingly given, for better or worse.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the canvass amounted to about L500, an amazingly large\r\nsum; he spared no expense in printing and posting his testimonials and\r\nletters to every one who had any influence with the Council, however\r\nsmall; but taking into consideration the cost of printing and postage\r\nin 1839, it is difficult to realise how the money was expended. His\r\naim was to make known his scientific attainments, powers as a\r\nteacher, and personal qualifications which he felt, if duly realised,\r\nwould outweigh the disadvantages of his youth and comparative\r\ninexperience. His testimonials spoke in strong terms of his abilities\r\nand characteristics; they were a good deal more numerous and elaborate\r\nthan is customary to-day, but Kennedy's also made a fat volume of 150\r\noctavo pages.\r\n\r\nAs the day of election drew near the excitement amongst citizens,\r\nprofessors, and students grew intense. Of the five candidates in the\r\nfield, three, including his former teacher Thatcher, speedily fell out\r\nof the running. Dr. Evory Kennedy, of Dublin, and Simpson stood face\r\nto face as rivals. Kennedy was no mean opponent, and his supporters\r\nhonestly considered him the better man of the two; his attainments\r\ncertainly merited warm support. The prophets foretold a close\r\nstruggle, and the event proved them correct. So keen was public\r\ninterest that when a report was circulated that Kennedy was a bad\r\nlecturer, his friends brought him over from Dublin a few days before\r\nthe election, hired a public room, and made him lecture to a crowded\r\nand enthusiastic audience to dispel that illusion. In spite of this\r\nthe popular vote was decidedly in Simpson's favour; if the citizens\r\nhad had votes Simpson would have been returned at the head of the poll\r\nby a large majority.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, February 4, 1840, at a Council meeting, at which all\r\nthirty-three members were present, the Provost himself proposed\r\nKennedy, while Baillie Ramsay proposed Simpson. The result was\r\nawaited with breathless suspense, the chamber being crowded by anxious\r\nspectators. Simpson's enthusiasm had infected his supporters; he had\r\nkindled the first sparks of that enthusiastic affection with which the\r\ncitizens of Edinburgh ever after regarded him; when his triumph, by\r\nthe narrowest majority, was announced, the cheers resounded loud and\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe same evening he was able to write to Liverpool:--\r\n\r\n  \"1, DEAN TERRACE.\r\n\r\n  \"I was this day elected Professor. My opponent had sixteen and I\r\n  had seventeen votes. All the political influence of both the\r\n  leading Whigs and Tories here was employed against me; but never\r\n  mind, I have got the chair in despite of them, Professors and all.\r\n  Jessie's honeymoon and mine is to commence to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the man's strong individuality which carried the day. The town\r\ncouncillors threw aside the political and academic bias of those who\r\nendeavoured to lead them, and elected the man who had boldly said,\r\n\"Did I not feel I am the best man for the Chair I would not go in for\r\nit\"; and had more boldly gone on showing them how thoroughly he felt\r\nwhat he said until they themselves came to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe gift of this Chair, as of many others in the University, has now\r\npassed from the hands of the Town Council into those of a body of\r\ncurators, seven in number, three nominated by the University Court\r\nand four by the Town Council; such a body might have made a more\r\ncautious choice, but never a more fortunate one both for the city\r\nand the University than this of their long-headed and far-sighted\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR AND PHYSICIAN. 1840-1847\r\n\r\n  Success as a lecturer--Increased practice--Generosity--Fashionable\r\n  patients--Memoir on Leprosy--Controversy concerning the Pathology\r\n  Chair--Address to the Graduates, 1842--Squabbles--Purchases 52,\r\n  Queen Street--A great and good physician--Called to London--Visit\r\n  to Erskine House--The daily scene at 52, Queen Street--Rangoon\r\n  petroleum and Christison--The disruption--His family--Appointed\r\n  Physician-Accoucheur to the Queen for Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimpson had not long been engaged upon his new duties before the town\r\ncouncillors gladly saw, and his brother professors were obliged to\r\nadmit, that the baker's son was bringing a mighty genius to bear upon\r\nthe subject of his choice from the chair of his ambition. He cherished\r\nno ill-feeling against those _confreres_ who had actively opposed his\r\ncandidature, but set to work amidst his new surroundings conscious\r\nthat the best way to obliterate bitter feelings was by gradually\r\ncreating a stronger feeling--that of respect for him as a man and a\r\nworker. He had dealt heavy blows himself during the conflict--blows\r\nnot easily forgotten. The position demanded tact and patience, and he\r\nwas not found wanting in either. He converted many who had worked\r\nagainst him into adherents, admirers, and even friends.\r\n\r\nHis lectures speedily attracted students. Besides those who were\r\nentering the profession, grey-headed and grey-bearded men, whose\r\nstudent days had long since passed away, came to sit at the feet of\r\nthis remarkable young man and hear the so recently despised subject\r\ndealt with in his own masterly, scientific manner. Conciseness,\r\nclearness, and directness characterised his delivery; while with\r\nillustration and anecdote he made his dull subject fascinatingly\r\ninteresting. It was his custom to write out on a black-board notes of\r\nthe subject on which he was about to speak--concise, pithy headings,\r\nwhich were hung up in the theatre and which he proceeded methodically\r\nto explain and enlarge upon. So successful were his efforts that even\r\nin the first session he was able to make the proud boast that his\r\nclass was for the first time in its history the largest in the\r\nUniversity, and this in spite of the fact that one of the leading\r\nprofessors altered his lecture hour to the same hour as Simpson's,\r\nwith the purpose of injuring the attendance at Simpson's class.\r\n\r\nA direct result of the reputation obtained through his course of\r\nlectures and improved professional position was the rapid increase of\r\nhis practice and the improvement of the class of his patients, so that\r\npecuniary profit came within his reach. He continued to be a general\r\npractitioner, however, attending to all classes of cases that came to\r\nhim; but his zeal for midwifery and the diseases of women, together\r\nwith his renown in those subjects, brought mostly patients of the\r\nfemale sex to his consulting-room. With the improved position there\r\ncame necessarily increased expenditure, which at first exceeded the\r\nincome; he never stopped to consider the patients' circumstances or\r\nwhether he was likely to be paid for his services. \"I prefer to have\r\nmy reward in the gratitude of my patients,\" he said. He treated all\r\nthat came to him, and his generous nature was oftentimes taken\r\nadvantage of by persons very well able to remunerate him; moreover, at\r\nthis time, when his pecuniary profit did not equal his professional\r\nreputation, he cheerfully helped many who appealed to him with amounts\r\nhe could ill spare.\r\n\r\nHis father-in-law generously and willingly stood by him until the fees\r\nbegan to come in more freely--his brother Sandy, who had supported him\r\nhitherto, having now other claims upon his purse. He found two\r\nordinary but costly steps advisable--first, to move into a better and\r\nmore centrally situated house; and, secondly, to obtain a carriage,\r\n\"both to support my rank among my wealthier compeers and to save my\r\nbody from excess of work.\" The outlay was justified in the result; the\r\nfees from students and from his private practice very soon enabled him\r\nto repay the debts to his brothers and his father-in-law without\r\ninconvenience and with grateful pleasure. Once and for ever within\r\nthe first few years of his professorship he placed himself in a safe\r\nposition, free from all pecuniary anxiety.\r\n\r\nIf he had laboured hard to fit himself for the front rank of his\r\nprofession, his work on attaining that position showed increase rather\r\nthan abatement. His private practice alone was the work of more than\r\none ordinary individual, and his professorial duties took up some of\r\nthe best hours of his day. In the evenings and at all odd times he\r\nbusied himself with absorbing current or ancient literature, or in\r\npreparing his own contributions to both professional and general\r\nknowledge either with the pen or by experiment. \"Oh that there were\r\ndouble twenty-four hours in the day,\" he sighed at a time when he was\r\nworking at highest pressure, practising amongst peers, commoners, and\r\ncottagers alike, who all flocked to his residence or sent long\r\ndistances for him. When Princess Marie of Baden, wife of the Duke of\r\nHamilton, came under his special care in 1843 he felt that he was\r\nplaced at the top of his profession in Scotland, and must have\r\nsmilingly recalled the words of old Dr. Dawson, of Bathgate, when he\r\nheard of the successful contest for the Chair. \"It's all very well,\"\r\nhe had said, \"to have got the Chair! But he can never have such a\r\npractice as Professor Hamilton. Why, ladies have been known to come\r\nfrom England to consult him!\"\r\n\r\nThey came from the furthest parts of Greater Britain to consult\r\nHamilton's successor, in spite of the old doctor's prognostication!\r\n\r\nThe energy as well as the versatility of the man is well shown in the\r\nworks which he found time to carry on while he was thus establishing\r\nhimself as a teacher and as a practitioner, during the years from 1840\r\nto 1845. One of his first literary efforts, not wholly professional,\r\nthe Memoir on \"Leprosy and Leper-Houses,\" was produced at that time.\r\nIt was a work of relaxation and pleasure, for it carried him deeply\r\ninto his favourite archaeology. The fascination which this subject\r\nalways had for him sprang from his love of nature, and of the greatest\r\nwork of nature--man. \"The leading object and intent of all the\r\nantiquarian's pursuit is MAN,\" he said, \"and man's ways and works, his\r\nhabits and thoughts, from the earliest dates at which we can find his\r\ntraces and tracks upon the earth, onwards and forwards along the\r\njourney of past time. During this long journey he has everywhere left\r\nscattered behind him and around him innumerable relics forming so many\r\npermanent impressions and evidences of his march and progress.\"\r\n\r\nThe quantity and quality of the information concerning leper hospitals\r\nwhich he collected and embodied in his memoir, contributed to the\r\nEdinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society in March, 1841, was phenomenal.\r\nHe had consulted old manuscripts and registers, monastic chronicles,\r\nburgh records, and Acts of Parliament, as well as works of antiquity,\r\ntravel, and history. He gave close upon five hundred references, as\r\nwell as a list of one hundred and nineteen leper-houses, whose\r\nexistence in Britain and whose history he had traced. The work\r\nillustrates the objects and proper methods of antiquarian research,\r\nwhich twenty years afterwards he dilated upon in his address from the\r\nChair of the Scottish Society of Antiquaries. In the course of it he\r\npointed out how vigorously our ancestors had set to work to stamp out\r\nthe disease when it spread through Europe during the period from the\r\ntenth to the sixteenth century. The method adopted was that still\r\nemployed--segregation; about the twelfth century scarcely a town or\r\nburgh in France and Britain was without its leper-hospital. Although\r\nwe in Britain are happily now freed from its ravages, other parts of\r\nthe world are not so fortunate. It is still regarded popularly as an\r\nincurable disease, as it was in 1597, when one Catherine Livingstone\r\nwas gravely brought to trial for witchcraft, one instance of which had\r\nbeen that she dared to state her ability to cure \"leprosie, which the\r\nmaist expert men in medicine are not abil to do.\" The indictment set\r\nforth that she \"took a reid cock, slew it, baked a bannock with the\r\nblude of it, and gaf the samyn to the leper to eat.\" The witch's\r\nremedy is scarcely more curious and certainly no less useful than\r\nthose recommended two centuries later by John Wesley in his \"Primitive\r\nPhysic,\" where, moreover, he cheerfully, if somewhat too briefly to\r\nsatisfy the modern inquirer, reports the cure \"of a most desperate\r\ncase\" by the drinking of a half-pint of celery-whey morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nScotland was severely smitten by leprosy in the centuries when it\r\noverspread Europe; Robert Bruce fell a victim to it in 1339, and the\r\ndisease seems to have lingered in the North after it had almost\r\nvanished from England.\r\n\r\nSimpson's paper was published in the _Edinburgh Medical and Surgical\r\nJournal_ in three parts in 1841 and 1842, and to this day is the most\r\nvaluable contribution to the interesting and important history of the\r\ndisease. Some of the information had been collected in his student\r\ndays. In his antiquarian researches he had frequently met with\r\nreferences to the dirty and unwholesome habits and surroundings of\r\nScots towns in early days. The thought that dirt and disease were\r\ndirectly connected--a new thought even so recently as fifty years\r\nago--led to his investigations. He found that leprosy was most\r\nprevalent at the time when his country was most dirty; but he was not\r\nable to establish his supposition that the cause of the disease lay in\r\nthe insanitary surroundings of the people; indeed his researches\r\nproved that, on the contrary, leprosy had declined and practically\r\ndisappeared from the country long before any material improvement in\r\nsanitary conditions took place.\r\n\r\nSimpson's conduct when Professor Thomson resigned the Chair of\r\nPathology illustrates the vigour with which he entered into quite\r\ncasually arising incidents where he saw that strength and a fight were\r\nnecessary to conquer an evil or prevent an abuse. Thomson resigned in\r\n1841 owing to ill-health. The Chair had been established by William\r\nIV. in 1831 on the representations of Thomson himself, who succeeded\r\nin satisfying Lord Melbourne that the subject was worthy of the\r\ndignity of a separate Chair, in spite of the protests of the Senatus\r\nAcademicus, who throughout the history of the medical faculty\r\ngenerally appear to have been actuated more by personal considerations\r\nand professional jealousies, where new developments were in process,\r\nthan by zeal for their _Alma Mater_. Professors Syme and Alison\r\nactively led an agitation that with Thomson's resignation the separate\r\nteaching of pathology should be brought to an end. Without a moment's\r\nhesitation, in the midst of his hard work, and suffering from\r\nindifferent health, Simpson plunged into a controversy with these\r\ncolleagues, in which he silenced at once and for ever the detractors\r\nwho had sneered at him as an ignorant, uncultured man-midwife. The\r\ncontroversy as usual was followed with intense interest by Edinburgh\r\nfolks, and Simpson received a first taste of that popular approval\r\nwhich undoubtedly was one of the enjoyments of his life. The Crown\r\navoided the difficulty of deciding between the rival petitioners for\r\nand against the Chair by transferring its patronage to the Town\r\nCouncil, who showed the same foresight which had led them to appoint\r\nSimpson, in deciding to maintain its existence. Unfortunately their\r\nwisdom failed when they elected as Thomson's successor a man who,\r\nalthough of brilliant attainments, subsequently brought discredit upon\r\nhis University and himself by becoming a convert to homoeopathy.\r\nSimpson, who was indirectly instrumental in securing the Chair of\r\nPathology for this man became his bitterest opponent when he declared\r\nhimself a follower of Hahnemann's unorthodox and mistaken doctrines.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 it fell to Simpson's lot to deliver the customary address to\r\nthe medical graduates after they had received their degrees at the\r\nannual ceremonial on the 1st of August. He treated his listeners to a\r\ndiscourse on the duties of young physicians. When we remember that he\r\nhad attained to his then high professional position while he was no\r\nmore than a young physician himself, we recognise that he was but\r\nsetting forth the ideals and principles which had been and still were\r\nhis guides in life and conduct.\r\n\r\nAfter warning his audience against regarding the gaining of the\r\ncoveted degree as the end of their student career, instead of as in\r\nreality the opening up of a lifetime of observation and study, he\r\npointed out that self-patronage was the best of all patronage. \"Place\r\nfrom the first,\" he said, \"all your hopes of advancement upon the\r\nbreadth and extent of your medical abilities alone.... Rather walk by\r\nthe steady light of your own lamp than by the more dazzling, but to\r\nyou more uncertain, lustre borrowed from that of others ... Young\r\nphysicians often dream that by extending the circle of their private\r\nacquaintances they thus afford themselves the best chance of extending\r\nthe circle of their private patients.... No man will in any case of\r\ndoubt and danger entrust to your professional care the guardianship of\r\nhis own life or of the life of those who are near and dear to his\r\nheart, merely because you happen to be on terms of intimacy with him.\r\nThe self-interest of human nature forbids it.... The accomplishments\r\nwhich render you acceptable in the drawing-room are not always those\r\nthat would make your visits longed for or valued in the chamber of\r\nsickness and sorrow.... Give therefore your whole energies to\r\nmedicine; and in its multiplied departments you will find 'ample room\r\nand verge enough' for the most energetic as well as the most\r\ncomprehensive mind. Place your faith in no extrinsic influences. Let\r\nyour own professional character be the one great patron to whom you\r\never look for your professional advancement.\" He exhorted the young\r\npractitioners above all to save and economise their time, and to\r\nregard it as a property to be avaricious of and of every item of which\r\nthey were to render a proper account to themselves. \"It is by\r\ncarefully preserving, confirming, and making diligent use of these\r\nbroken and disjointed portions of it, which others thoughtlessly waste\r\nand destroy, that almost all the highest reputations in the medical\r\nprofession have been formed.\" He strongly urged the value of a \"proper\r\ncovetousness of time.\" \"Look around, and you will find that those who\r\nhave the most to do in the way of business as practitioners have also\r\napparently the most time to spare as observers and writers.... And\r\nwhy? Because they have all their daily duties perfectly assorted and\r\narrayed; they save from loss and destruction every possible fragment\r\nof time and this very industry and precision procures them more true\r\nleisure than indolence can boast of.\"\r\n\r\nIn referring to the relation of practitioner to patient, he\r\nspoke on a subject which has been much discussed in recent years\r\nwithout altering the principle originally laid down in the oath of\r\nHippocrates:--\"Whatever,\" said Simpson, \"is communicated to you\r\nas a matter of professional confidence, must ever remain buried\r\nwithin your own breasts in all the silence and secrecy of the\r\ngrave.\" He concluded his address with well-judged remarks on the\r\nrelation of the physician to his professional brethren, counselling\r\nhis hearers to observe the Golden Rule, and, moreover, \"if it be\r\npossible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men;\r\nnever allow the darker part of your nature to persuade you to\r\nthe attempt of over-taking him who has distanced you in the race\r\nof life by any unjust efforts to lame the character, and thus\r\ndiminish the speed, of your adversary. And if such attempts are\r\nmade upon you by others, have no dread of them--if you are armed\r\nstrong in honesty, if you have pursued a line of irreproachable\r\ntruth and unbending rectitude of conduct. 'Be thou as pure as\r\nsnow thou shalt not escape calumny.'... Your future career is a\r\nmatter of your own selection, and will be regulated by the conduct\r\nwhich you choose to follow. That career may be one of happiness or\r\nself-regret, one of honour or of obscurity, one of wealth or of\r\npoverty. The one or other result is not a matter of _chance_, but\r\na matter of choice on your part. Your diligence and industry for\r\nthe next few years will almost inevitably secure for you the one;\r\nyour apathy and indolence will almost inevitably entail upon you\r\nthe other. May God, in His infinite goodness, enable you to\r\nselect the wiser and the better path.\"\r\n\r\nIn this address, as in that previously quoted, we hear him exhorting\r\nhis young listeners to a line of conduct which we know to have been\r\nbroadly his own in practice as well as in ideal. During these early\r\nyears as professor, Simpson had to ward off many ill-disposed\r\nadversaries, and he met their attack with the determination and\r\npowerful preparedness that characterised his attitude in later years,\r\nwhen he experienced the hostility so constantly opposed to genuine\r\nreformers, and men who have lived ahead of their times. He sometimes\r\nregarded these encounters regretfully himself; but none the less\r\nremembered to\r\n\r\n  \"Bear't that the opposed may beware.\"\r\n\r\nThe correspondence pertaining to some of these disputes was filed and\r\nticketed, with brief contempt, \"Squabbles.\" His controversy with\r\nProfessor Syme over a personal matter in 1845 was not to the credit of\r\neither of these great men, and, as Simpson himself confessed, was\r\nequally discreditable to their profession. Simpson had seen, as has\r\nbeen pointed out, several of his teachers fighting long and strongly\r\nfor their own cherished objects; and he doubtless then, in his student\r\ndays, learnt the lesson that vigorous persistence had the power to\r\ngain much that at first seemed hopeless; he fought with such energy,\r\nthat he accomplished in his own lifetime what the example of others\r\nmight have led him to think would have been accomplished only by his\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nThe growth of his practice up to 1847 was little short of phenomenal.\r\nIn 1845 he purchased No. 52, Queen-street, the house which he\r\ninhabited up to his death, and which became the Mecca of hundreds upon\r\nhundreds of pilgrims from all quarters of the globe. Here, in those\r\nyears, he was sought and consulted by unceasing crowds; in the public\r\nmind he was undoubtedly endowed with more than human powers, and\r\nregarded as a magician, at the wave of whose wand pain and disease\r\nwould vanish. This caused him much embarrassment, and brought upon him\r\nthe abuse of ignorant persons, irritated to find that, after all, even\r\nin Simpson's person, there was a limit to human powers; or of others\r\nwith unimportant ailments who were disappointed to find that, once\r\nhaving made his diagnosis of their condition, he would have no more of\r\nthem, preferring to place his time at the disposal of those whose\r\nsufferings were real and capable of relief, or whose cases were\r\ncomplicated and interesting. The question of remuneration was always\r\nsecondary, and so careless was he in pecuniary matters that it is\r\nrelated that he would wrap up interesting specimens, professional or\r\nantiquarian, in bank notes; and his trusted valet was in the habit of\r\nemptying his pockets at night of the money earned in the day, to\r\nprevent its being lost, mislaid, or given away to undeserving persons.\r\nWith him work was first and fee second. Like a great modern teacher he\r\nwas able to say, \"Work first--you are God's servant; fee first--you\r\nare the fiend's.\" To Simpson \"work was master and the Lord of Work,\r\nwho is God.\"\r\n\r\nThe personal power and attractiveness of the man were large factors in\r\ngaining the practice which he now enjoyed. But he did not depend for\r\nsuccess on these alone, by any means. His professional reputation was\r\nfully won by great work in obstetrics and gynaecology, and by the\r\nintroduction of methods and instruments which contributed to the\r\nsaving of countless lives. It has been said that he gave a new life to\r\nthe obstetric art, and presided at the birth of gynaecology. He had\r\ndone this before the great deed was dreamt of which hands his name\r\ndown to posterity, before his discovery of the anaesthetic power of\r\nchloroform. Simpson was a great physician, the leading practitioner\r\nof the art and exponent of the science with which his name will always\r\nbe connected. But many great physicians have failed to fulfil as\r\nSimpson did, Robert Louis Stevenson's description of the physician:--\r\n\r\n\"Generosity he has such as is possible to those who practise an art,\r\nnever to those who drive a trade; discretion tested by a hundred\r\nsecrets; tact tried in a thousand embarrassments; and what are more\r\nHeraclean cheerfulness and courage. So it is that he brings air and\r\ncheer into the sick room, and often enough, though not so often as he\r\nwishes, brings healing.\"\r\n\r\nGreat as a man and great as a physician, Simpson was actually run after\r\nby the greatest in the land. In 1845 he was summoned professionally\r\nto London, and gave an interesting description of his kindly reception\r\nby the Duchess of Sutherland and her family in a letter written from\r\nStafford House. His advent to London was a matter of notoriety, and\r\nhe noted that he bought in the street a life of himself which\r\nmightily diverted him and made him laugh until he was sore. A year or\r\nmore later he was invited for rest and change to Erskine House by\r\nLord Blantyre, where he says, \"the Duchess of Sutherland, the Marquis\r\nand Marchioness of Lorne, and two Ladies Gower have made up with myself\r\nall the strangers.\" \"Tell Janet,\" he wrote to his brother, \"I think now\r\nartificial flowers very ungenteel. The ladies here wear nothing but\r\nreal flowers in their hair, and every day they come down with\r\nsomething new and for us males to guess at. Often the Duchess wears a\r\nsimple chaplet of ivy leaves, sometimes a bracken leaf is all she sports\r\nin her head ornaments, and beautiful it looks. Rowans and 'haws' are\r\noften worn beaded into crowns or flowers or chaplets. Heather is also\r\na favourite. On Thursday Lady Lorne came down with a most beautiful\r\nchaplet tying round and keeping down her braided hair. It was a long\r\nbunch of bramble leaves and half-ripe bramble berries--actual true\r\nbrambles. They have been all exceedingly kind to me, and I really\r\nfeel quite at home among them though the only untitled personage at\r\ntable.\"\r\n\r\nThe daily scene at 52, Queen Street was now unique. Those who had the\r\nfortune to lunch or breakfast in that hospitable house never forgot\r\nit. Statesmen, noblemen, artists, scientists, clergymen, and\r\npoliticians from various countries sat down together and entertained\r\neach other or attempted to do so in their different languages. The\r\nhost guided the conversation while he still glanced over the newspaper\r\nor some newly published book, and never failed by skilful leading to\r\nentice out of every one the best knowledge that they possessed. With\r\nhis quick insight he rarely failed in his estimate of character, but\r\nrapidly perceived even in a stranger where the conventional ceased and\r\nthe real man began.\r\n\r\nNo stranger to Edinburgh omitted to bring or obtain an introduction\r\nto the genial professor; all were welcome, and an open table was kept.\r\nThe scene has been described from intimate knowledge in the columns of\r\nthe _Scots Observer_ as follows:--\"Luncheon is set on the table, and\r\nsome ten, twenty, or even fifty people wait the appearance of their\r\nhost, who is on his rounds maybe, or in another room ministers to an\r\nurgent case. A stranger who has not learnt that the great Simpson was\r\nonly in the broadest sense a punctual man--of minutes, hours, he knew\r\nnothing, but none more reliably punctual, few so unsparingly regular\r\nin working while 'tis called to-day--might be prompted by hungry\r\ndiscontent to suggest that none but the wealthiest can keep the doctor\r\nfrom his guests. The mere suggestion would be infamous, for rich and\r\nragged alike pay fees or not exactly as it pleases them. Whatever the\r\ncause, the host still lingers, and the impatient stranger has time to\r\nwonder how it is that so odd an assortment of human beings should be\r\nmet together in one room. Lords and Commons rub shoulders at his\r\ntable; the salt of the earth sit down side by side with the\r\nsavourless; tweed jostles broadcloth; the town-bred Briton looks\r\naskance at his country-bred compatriot, and both unconsciously shudder\r\nat the Briton with no breeding at all. In one room are assembled\r\ntogether the American of bluest blood; the Yankee bagman; the\r\nslave-owning Southerner, and even the man of colour hateful to both\r\nalike. The atmosphere is chill like the grave, each guest, eyeing his\r\nneighbour suspiciously, shrinks into his own social shell; on each\r\nface the meanness and snobbery of humankind is, if not aggressively\r\nexpressed, at least clearly legible; when all at once Simpson bustles\r\nin. In a few minutes, under the genial influence of his presence, all\r\ntongues are set a-wagging, and well may you ask whether the men who\r\nleave his house after luncheon are those who half-an-hour ago regarded\r\neach other with cold disdain. For now they are cordial, kindly,\r\nsympathetic; each has been induced to show whatever was attractive in\r\nhis nature, or to give the fruits of his experience. If in one short\r\nhour Simpson could thus transform a crowd of frigid, haughty strangers\r\ninto an assemblage of decent, amiable human beings, what could he not\r\nachieve in a day, a year, or a life?\"\r\n\r\nHis reception of members of his own profession was specially cordial,\r\nand if those from any one country were more welcome than others, it\r\nwas the many who crossed the Atlantic to see and hear him. America had\r\nthe greatest share in the birth of anaesthetics, and Simpson's intimacy\r\nwith so many of the profession in the United States made it easy for\r\nthem to welcome his assistance in that great event. Gynaecology, too,\r\nwas eagerly taken up in America, and many were Simpson's admirers from\r\nthat country who returned home fired by his influence to work out for\r\nthemselves valuable additions to that science.\r\n\r\nSimpson paid close attention to current events in other branches of\r\nscience, in politics, and in religion. Sir Robert Christison and he\r\nwere at one time associated in an enterprise which narrowly escaped\r\nbeing the source of a fortune to him. Rangoon petroleum which was\r\nobtained from pits dug on the banks of the Irawaddy had been\r\nchemically investigated by Christison, and he had isolated from it a\r\nsubstance which he named petroline; unfortunately, unknown to him, a\r\nGerman chemist had independently made the same discovery a few months\r\nearlier, and christened the substance paraffin. When, a few years\r\nlater, it occurred to Simpson that the crude Rangoon petroleum might\r\nserve as a lubricant for machinery and prove cheaper than those in\r\ngeneral use, he applied to Christison. He met with willing assistance,\r\nbut a refusal on principle to have anything to do with a patent, which\r\nChristison laughingly suggested, might be called \"Simpson's\r\nincomparable antifriction lubricant!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I called for Simpson,\" says Christison, in his Recollections,\r\n\"his two reception rooms were as usual full of patients, more were\r\nseated in the lobby, female faces stared from all the windows in\r\nvacant expectancy, and a lady was ringing the door bell. But the\r\ndoctor brushed through the crowd to join me, and left them all kicking\r\ntheir heels for the next two hours.\"\r\n\r\nTheir experiments proved that petroleum was vastly superior to sperm\r\noil, the best known and most commonly used lubricant. Simpson\r\nproceeded to take out a patent, having no such scruples as Christison;\r\nbut to his chagrin found that he had been forestalled by others, and\r\nhad to abandon the subject.\r\n\r\nAbout the period now referred to Scotland was stirred from end to end\r\nby the ecclesiastical movement which culminated in the crisis known as\r\nthe Disruption, when, for reasons connected with the jurisdiction of\r\nthe National Church, a majority of its members severed their\r\nconnection therewith in a public and dramatic fashion, and \"came out\"\r\nto found the now strong and vigorous Free Kirk. Simpson at first\r\nsteered clear of all the squabbles and discussions which the movement\r\ngave rise to, but when affairs approached a crisis he threw his lot in\r\nwith the leaders of the new movement, and became a staunch Free\r\nChurchman.\r\n\r\nBusy as he was, Simpson fully enjoyed his home and all the inner\r\ndomestic life. He was a cheery and hearty host to his intimate\r\nfriends, and took a pleasure in impromptu entertainments got up by\r\nhimself in his own house, when he found time at his disposal for such\r\namusement. His first child--a daughter--of whom he was mightily proud,\r\nwas born in 1840; his first son, David, in 1842; and the second,\r\nWalter, in 1843. In 1844 the young couple, in the midst of their\r\nrising prosperity, suffered the loss of their daughter, who died after\r\na brief illness. Simpson felt the loss keenly, and wrote pathetically\r\non the subject to his relations; long afterwards he loved to talk of\r\nher and her winning ways.\r\n\r\nBy 1846 the vast majority of his work lay in obstetrics and\r\ngynaecology, although he himself would no doubt have indignantly\r\nrepelled the suggestion that he was a specialist; his mind recognised\r\nthe interdependence of all the great branches of the healing art, and\r\nthe necessity for any who wished to excel or be useful practitioners\r\nto be _au courant_ with each and every branch. He had early shown that\r\nas a pathologist alone he was worthy of a niche in the temple of fame;\r\nand in later days he was urged to apply for the vacant chair of Physic\r\nin his own University; while Professor A. R. Simpson tells us that\r\nforeigners working in the sphere of surgery sometimes spoke of him as\r\na surgeon.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1847 his good friend, the Duchess of Sutherland, wrote to\r\ninform him that the Queen had much pleasure in conferring upon him the\r\nvacant post of Physician to Her Majesty. In the Queen's own words,\r\n\"His high character and abilities made him very fit for the post.\" He\r\nheld this post until his death, under the title of Physician\r\nAccoucheur to the Queen for Scotland.\r\n\r\nThus in his thirty-sixth year, to the pride of his family and of the\r\nwhole village community in which he had been born and received his\r\nearly training, to the admiration of patients and friends, as well as\r\nto his own conscious satisfaction, the Bathgate baker's son had risen\r\nby his own efforts to the highest attainable position in his native\r\nland. But the work which was to make him one of the most conspicuous\r\nfigures in the history of medicine, and raise him to a place of honour\r\nin the grateful estimation of humanity, was scarcely begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF ANAESTHETICS. 1844-1847\r\n\r\n  His early sympathy for suffering--Surgical methods before the\r\n  discovery of anaesthetics--His mental struggle caused by the\r\n  sickening sights of the operating theatre--His researches into the\r\n  history of anaesthesia--Indian hemp--Mandrake--Alcohol--Hypnotism and\r\n  other methods--Inhalation of drugs--Sir Humphry Davy--Anaesthetics\r\n  discovered in America--Horace Wells and laughing-gas--Morton and\r\n  ether--Ether in Great Britain--He uses it in midwifery\r\n  practice--Search for a better-anaesthetic--Discovery of anaesthetic\r\n  power of chloroform.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest student days the desire had ever been present in\r\nSimpson's mind to see some means devised for preventing the sufferings\r\nendured by patients on the operating table, without, as he put it,\r\n\"interfering with the free and healthy play of the natural functions.\"\r\nIt is difficult for us at the close of the nineteenth century to\r\nunderstand, without an effort of the imagination, the strong\r\nincentives which he had for such a wish. Even to-day, when operations\r\nare conducted without the infliction of pain, young students are not\r\nunfrequently overcome by the sight and the thought of what is in front\r\nof them. At the commencement of a winter session the theatre is\r\ncrowded with those students who are entering upon surgical study, and\r\nwith others, not so far advanced, who have come to get a preliminary\r\npeep at the practice of this fascinatingly interesting art. Many of\r\nthese at first succumb and faint even before the surgeon has begun his\r\nwork, and sometimes are only persuaded to pursue their studies by the\r\nencouragement of kindly teachers.\r\n\r\nSimpson also went through this trying experience, but it must have\r\nbeen a greater struggle to him to persist. The surroundings of the\r\nsurgeon at the commencement of the century were vastly more repugnant\r\nto a youth of sensitive nature than to-day. The operating theatre then\r\nhas been compared to a butcher's shambles; cleanliness was not\r\nconsidered necessary, and little attention was paid to the feelings of\r\nthe patient. He was held down by three or four pairs of powerful arms\r\nas the surgeon boldly and rapidly did his work, despite the screams,\r\nstopping, perhaps, only to roughly abuse the patient for some agonised\r\nmovement which had interfered with the course of action. The poor\r\nwretch saw the instruments handed one by one by the assistant, and\r\nheard the surgeon's calm directions and his remarks on the case. The\r\nbarbarous practice of arresting bleeding by the application of red-hot\r\nirons to the surface of the wound had indeed ceased three centuries\r\nbefore, when that humane reformer, Pare, displaced it with the method\r\nof tying the open blood-vessel, but the patient's blood gushed forth\r\nbefore him until arrested, into the sawdust spread to receive it, and\r\nthe sight and the hot odour of it oftentimes mercifully caused him to\r\nfaint. The spirit of Pare who, when relating a successful operation,\r\nwould humbly add at the end, \"I dressed him; God healed him,\" had not\r\ndescended to those who practised in Simpson's day the art for which\r\nPare did so much. It had grown to be necessary for a surgeon to be\r\nrough and callous; it was expected of him by the public; he was a man\r\nto be pointed at in the street, and shuddered at when he passed, by\r\nall who devoutly prayed they might escape his clutches. Much of this\r\nconduct was mere mannerism; it had become the custom, and had to be\r\nmaintained in order to preserve the dignity and stamp the identity of\r\nthe surgeon. Much of it arose from the haste with which the surgeon\r\nhad to work; the quicker the operation the better chance had the\r\npatient; it was no uncommon thing to see a bystander timing the\r\nsurgeon's work, as the professional time-keeper carefully times a\r\nrace; and the rapidity of each surgeon's performances was a subject of\r\ncomparison and admiration amongst the students of his day. Much of it\r\nalso arose from the effect of the hideous scenes in the operating room\r\nupon the surgeon himself; his nerve had to become of iron if he\r\ndesired to succeed, and with the nerve the face and the manner, but\r\nnot necessarily always the heart hardened also. Tennyson possibly\r\nrecollected these days, when he wrote of the surgeon who\r\n\r\n  \"Sent a chill to my heart when I saw him come in at the door,\r\n  Fresh from the surgery schools of France, and of other lands;\r\n  Harsh red hair, big voice, big chest, big merciless hands.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Simpson first saw Liston raise his knife to operate on a poor\r\nHighland woman, he actually felt so repelled that he contemplated\r\nabandoning his studies, and made a serious attempt to enter upon legal\r\nwork instead. But the mental struggle with which medical men of all\r\ncountries, and in all times, can sympathise out of their own\r\nknowledge, ended in a victory for medicine, and a triumphant return to\r\nhis studies with the question permanently engraved on the tablets of\r\nhis mind, \"Can nothing be done to prevent this suffering?\"\r\n\r\nIt is necessary and it is certainly beneficial that we should thus\r\nremind ourselves of the horrors which surrounded the surgeon so\r\nrecently as sixty years ago. \"Before the days of anaesthetics,\" wrote\r\nan old patient to Simpson, in a letter which he treasured with\r\npride--the writer was himself a medical man--\"a patient preparing for\r\nan operation was like a condemned criminal preparing for execution. He\r\ncounted the days till the appointed day came. He counted the hours of\r\nthat day till the appointed hour came. He listened for the echo in the\r\nstreet of the surgeon's carriage. He watched for his pull at the door\r\nbell; for his foot on the stair; for his step in the room; for the\r\nproduction of his dreaded instruments; for his few grave words, and\r\nhis last preparations before beginning. And then he surrendered his\r\nliberty and, revolting at the necessity, submitted to be held or\r\nbound, and helplessly gave himself up to the cruel knife.\".\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, a monstrous ogre this giant Pain, holding the poor\r\nweak human creature in its merciless clutches, which Simpson even in\r\nhis youthful days bethought himself to attack. It is well that we who\r\nare the heirs, should know how Simpson and those others whose names\r\nare ever associated with his, slew the monster, won the victory, and\r\nchampioned the human race forward into a land where further victories\r\nundreamt of by themselves are now being daily won.\r\n\r\nSimpson searched into ancient history in order to ascertain the\r\nmethods, if any, by which in remote and mediaeval times surgeons sought\r\nto prevent the pain of operations. The most time-honoured method seems\r\nto have been by the internal administration of drugs, the chief one\r\nused being Indian hemp, which was well known in the East, and under\r\none of its names _haschish_ gave origin to the term assassin (strictly\r\neater of haschish). A certain Arab Sheikh got together a band of\r\nfollowers to whom he administered haschish, which produced in them its\r\nusual effect--beautiful dreams of a delightful paradise. He induced\r\nthem to believe so thoroughly in his power to gain for them at death\r\npermanent entrance to this paradise that they obeyed all his ferocious\r\nand bloodthirsty behests. Thus these assassins became known as men\r\nobedient to their leader in any murderous enterprise. Indian hemp was,\r\nand still is, used as a luxury all over the East, as well as to annul\r\npain, and was used by criminals doomed to torture or execution.\r\nSimpson thought the _nepenthe_ of Homer was a preparation of this\r\ndrug; he also refers to the fact that Herodotus relates that the\r\nMassagetae inhaled the vapour of burning hemp to produce intoxication\r\nand pleasurable excitement.\r\n\r\nMandrake was used in a similar manner and for similar purposes as\r\nIndian hemp in the Middle Ages, but it fell into disuse on account of\r\nthe fatal results that often followed. It is frequently referred to by\r\nShakspeare both for its narcotic properties and for its fabulous power\r\nof uttering a scream when torn up by the roots, to hear which meant\r\ndeath or madness. Simpson cited also well-known passages from\r\nShakspeare to prove that the practice of \"locking up the spirits a\r\ntime\" was known to that poet.\r\n\r\nIn later days the intoxication produced by alcohol was taken advantage\r\nof, and instances of its use have been known in quite recent years in\r\nthe Colonies, where both a surgeon and chloroform were out of reach.\r\n\r\nNo drug, however, was known to be of such value in producing\r\nanaesthesia as to be constantly used, and many trials were made of\r\nother means, notably that of compressing the nerves supplying the part\r\nto be operated upon, but this was found to be too painful in itself.\r\nThe stupor produced by compressing the carotid arteries--a method\r\ntaken advantage of by the ruffians known as garotters--was also put in\r\npractice for a time during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,\r\nbut it was found too barbarous a method even for those days.\r\n\r\nHypnotism was known to the Indians, Egyptians, and Persians at a very\r\nremote period, and may possibly have been used by them sometimes to\r\nproduce anaesthesia for surgical purposes. Simpson was attracted by the\r\nwords of the poet Middleton in his tragedy \"Women, beware Women\"\r\n(1617) where he says--\r\n\r\n  \"I'll imitate the pities of old surgeons\r\n  To this lost limb--who ere they show their art\r\n  Cast me asleep, then cut the diseased part.\"\r\n\r\nWhen hypnotism made one of its periodic re-appearances in 1837, this\r\ntime under the name of mesmerism, after that extraordinary exponent of\r\nits powers Mesmer, Simpson recognised in it a possible method for\r\n\"casting the patient asleep\" before operation and set to work to\r\ninvestigate its phenomena. A Frenchman named Du Potet, disheartened by\r\nthe prejudice against mesmerism in his own country, came to London in\r\n1837, and was fortunate enough to receive the support of Dr. John\r\nElliotson, physician to University College Hospital. Elliotson's\r\nadvocacy of the new practice was received with ridicule by the\r\nprofession, and was treated with such scathing contempt by the\r\n_Lancet_ and other journals, that he was completely ruined.\r\n\r\nSimpson was very successful in his experiments with mesmerism,\r\nconducted on the lines suggested by Elliotson, but he recognised that,\r\nafter all, it was not the agent for which he was seeking, and dropped\r\nhis researches.\r\n\r\nHe did not resume them even when Liston, a few years later, stimulated\r\nby the advocacy of the Manchester surgeon Braid, who met with a better\r\nreception than Elliotson, and by the relation of a long series of\r\nsuccessful cases by a surgeon named Esdaile, in Calcutta, actually\r\nperformed operations with success on patients brought under its\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion to produce anaesthesia by the _inhalation_ of\r\ndrugs was made by Sir Humphry Davy in 1800. He discovered by\r\nexperiment upon himself that the inhalation of _nitrous oxide_\r\ngas--commonly known as a _laughing gas_--had the power of relieving\r\ntoothache and other pains; he described the effect as that of\r\n\"uneasiness being swallowed up for a few minutes by pleasures.\"\r\nAlthough he stopped short at this stage, and does not seem to have\r\nused the inhalation to produce actual loss of consciousness, he,\r\nnevertheless, forecast the future by suggesting that nitrous oxide\r\nmight be used as an inhalation in the performance of surgical\r\noperations, in which \"no great effusion of blood\" took place.\r\n\r\nSome thirty years later Faraday pointed out that _ether_ had\r\neffects upon the nervous system when inhaled, similar to those of\r\nlaughing-gas. These two drugs came to be inhaled more in jest than\r\nin earnest; more as an amusing scientific experiment for the sake of\r\nthe pleasure-giving excitement they set up, than for the purpose\r\nDavy had suggested. Ether, it is true, was recommended even before\r\nDavy's day for the relief of the suffering in asthma, but until the\r\nfifth decade of the century no one had attempted to prevent\r\nsuffering as inflicted by the surgeon or the dentist, by producing\r\nthe state of unconsciousness brought about by the inhalation of such\r\ndrugs as ether--a process now known to the world as anaesthesia.\r\n\r\nThe persons who first made the bold experiments which resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of how to produce anaesthesia were Americans; and two men\r\nwere prominently concerned in the discovery. Several others made\r\nisolated and successful efforts with both ether and nitrous oxide, but\r\nthey lacked the confidence and the courage to make their success\r\npublic and to persist in their experiments. Of these, Dr. Long, of\r\nAthens, Georgia, was one of the earliest; he is said to have\r\nsuccessfully removed a tumour from a patient under the influence of\r\nether in 1842, and in the Southern States he is regarded as the\r\ndiscoverer of anaesthesia. Dr. Jackson, of Boston--a scientific\r\nchemist--laid claim to the honour of the discovery after others had\r\nfought the fight and established the practice of anaesthesia. Neither\r\nof these men, for the reason already given, deserves the honour which\r\nis now universally attributed to their fellow-countrymen, Wells and\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\nHorace Wells was born at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1815, and was\r\neducated to the profession of dental surgeon. He gave much attention\r\nto the desire present in the minds of many men at that time to render\r\ndental operations painless. On December 10, 1844, he witnessed at a\r\npopular lecture the experiment of administering laughing-gas, and\r\nnoticed that a Mr. Cooley, while still under the influence of the gas,\r\nstruck and injured his limb against a bench without suffering pain.\r\nThe idea at once occurred to Wells that here was the agent he was in\r\nsearch of, and the very next day he experimented upon himself. If it\r\nhas ever been fortunate to have toothache it was so for Wells that\r\nday; he was troubled by an aching molar which was removed by a\r\ncolleague named Rigg, whilst he was fully under the influence of\r\nnitrous oxide; and thus he began what he himself at once called on\r\nrecovering consciousness, \"a new era in tooth-pulling.\" He proceeded\r\npromptly to test the experiment upon others and with complete success;\r\nand then making his success known, he proceeded with his former pupil\r\nMorton to Boston, and gave a public demonstration of his method which\r\nunfortunately was so imperfectly carried out that he was laughed at\r\nfor his pains and stigmatised an impostor. Wells himself stated that\r\nthe failure was due to the premature withdrawal of the bag containing\r\nthe gas, so that the patient was but partially under its influence\r\nwhen the tooth was extracted. Wells and Morton were ignominiously\r\nhissed by the crowd of practitioners and students gathered to see the\r\noperation. Wells never recovered from the disappointment and the\r\nillness which resulted, and although he was able to explain his\r\ndiscovery to the French Academy of Science in 1846, he unfortunately\r\ndied insane in New York two years later. Undoubtedly he was the first\r\nto discover the practicability of nitrous oxide anaesthesia, and to\r\nproclaim the discovery with a discoverer's zeal. Although his career\r\nended so sadly, his efforts had, nevertheless, inspired to greater\r\nendeavour his colleague Morton, who had not only been associated in\r\nhis experiments, but had been deeply interested in the subject for\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomas Green Morton was born in 1819; his father was a farmer\r\nat Charlton, Massachusetts. He qualified as a dentist at Baltimore,\r\nand entered into successful practice at Boston. Fired with the same\r\nambition as Wells, he made attempts to extract teeth painlessly with\r\nthe assistance of drugs administered, or sometimes of hypnotism. In\r\nDecember, 1844, after Wells's failure with nitrous oxide gas, he\r\nwisely abandoned that agent and investigated another which promised\r\nbetter results. He experimented first with a drug known as _chloric\r\nether_, but failing to get the desired effect, and at the suggestion\r\nof the aforementioned Dr. Jackson, he proceeded to investigate the\r\neffect of ordinary ether. The first experiments were made on animals,\r\nand were so encouraging that he believed he had at last found the\r\ndesired agent, provided the effect on human beings corresponded with\r\nthat upon dumb creatures. Boldly and heroically he made the necessary\r\nexperiment upon himself, and on September 30, 1846, inhaled ether from\r\na handkerchief while shut up in his room and seated in his own\r\noperating-chair. He speedily lost consciousness, and in seven or eight\r\nminutes awoke in possession of the greatest discovery that had ever\r\nbeen revealed to suffering humanity. We can picture the man gradually\r\nawakening in his chair first, to the consciousness of his surroundings\r\nand then to the consciousness of his great achievement; sitting with\r\nhis physical frame excited by the influence of the drug which he had\r\ninhaled, and his soul stirred to its deepest depth by the expanding\r\nthought of the far-reaching effects of what he had done.\r\n\r\n\"Twilight came on,\" he said, in subsequently relating the event. \"The\r\nhour had long passed when it was usual for patients to call. I had\r\njust resolved to inhale the ether again and have a tooth extracted\r\nunder its influence, when a feeble ring was heard at the door. Making\r\na motion to one of my assistants who started to answer the bell, I\r\nhastened myself to the door, where I found a man with his face bound\r\nup, who seemed to be suffering extremely. 'Doctor,' said he, 'I have a\r\ndreadful tooth, but it is so sore I cannot summon courage to have it\r\npulled; can't you mesmerise me?' I need not say that my heart bounded\r\nat this question, and that I found it difficult to control my\r\nfeelings, but putting a great constraint upon myself I expressed my\r\nsympathy, and invited him to walk into the office. I examined the\r\ntooth, and in the most encouraging manner told the poor sufferer that\r\nI had something better than mesmerism, by means of which I could take\r\nout his tooth, without giving him pain. He gladly consented, and\r\nsaturating my handkerchief with ether I gave it to him to inhale. He\r\nbecame unconscious almost immediately. It was dark. Dr. Haydon held\r\nthe lamp. My assistants were trembling with excitement, apprehending\r\nthe usual prolonged scream from the patient, while I extracted the\r\nfirmly-rooted bicuspid tooth. I was so much agitated that I came near\r\nthrowing the instrument out of the window. But now came a terrible\r\nreaction. The wrenching of the tooth had failed to rouse him in the\r\nslightest degree; he remained still and motionless as if already in\r\nthe embrace of death. The terrible thought flashed through my mind\r\nthat he might be dead--that in my zeal to test my new theory, I might\r\nhave gone too far, and sacrificed a human life. I trembled under the\r\nsense of my responsibility to my Maker, and to my fellowmen. I seized\r\na glass of water and dashed it in the man's face. The result proved\r\nmost happy. He recovered in a minute, and knew nothing of what had\r\noccurred. Seeing us all stand around he appeared bewildered. I\r\ninstantly, in as calm a tone as I could command, asked, 'Are you ready\r\nto have your tooth extracted?' 'Yes,' he answered, in a hesitating\r\nvoice. 'It is all over,' I said, pointing to a decayed tooth on the\r\nfloor. 'No,' he shouted, leaping from his chair. The name of the man\r\nwho thus for the first time underwent an operation under anaesthesia\r\ninduced by ether was Eben Frost.\"\r\n\r\nThe nature of the agent used by Morton was kept secret only a short\r\nperiod; the steps he took to bring his discovery before the medical\r\nprofession would have rendered it difficult if not impossible, even if\r\nether had not a penetrating tell-tale odour. Morton laid his method\r\nbefore one of the surgical staff of the Massachusetts General\r\nHospital, Boston, the same institution where Wells's ill-managed\r\ndemonstration had taken place two years before; he requested, with\r\ncomplete confidence, to be allowed to exhibit the powers of his agent.\r\nThe surgeon was sceptical, but wisely consented, after having\r\nsatisfied himself that there was no risk to life. A patient suffering\r\nfrom a tumour was chosen, and readily consented to act as a subject\r\nfor demonstration. A large crowd of professional men and students\r\nassembled in the surgical theatre on the morning of October 16, 1846,\r\nthe day chosen for the trial. The senior hospital surgeon, Dr. J.\r\nCollins Warren, was to perform the operation. The spectators, many of\r\nwhom no doubt recollected the failure with laughing-gas, were disposed\r\nto deride when the appointed hour passed and Morton did not appear;\r\nbut the delay was due only to the desire of the dentist to bring a\r\nproper inhaler, and although the crowd received him with a chilling\r\nreserve, and the occasion was one fit to try the nerve of the\r\nstrongest, Morton did not lose his presence of mind. He promptly\r\nanaesthetised the patient, and as unconcernedly as does the modern\r\nadministrator, nodded to the surgeon that the patient was ready. From\r\nthe first moment that the knife touched the patient, until the\r\noperation was concluded, no sound, no movement indicated that he was\r\nsuffering. The men who had scoffed once and had come, even the surgeon\r\nhimself, prepared to scoff again, realised the success and the wonder\r\nof it, and remained to admire. \"Gentlemen, this is no humbug,\"\r\nexclaimed Dr. Warren, as he finished his handiwork. When the patient\r\nrecovered he was questioned again and again, but stoutly maintained\r\nthat he had felt no pain--absolutely none. \"Gilbert Abbott, aged\r\ntwenty, painter, single,\" was the description of the man on whom was\r\nperformed the first surgical operation under the influence of ether.\r\n\r\nNews of the great success rapidly spread, and the experiment was\r\nrepeated by Morton and others in America, and similar work was taken\r\nup throughout Europe. It cannot be said that Morton derived much\r\nbenefit from his discovery. Although the greatness of it was\r\nrecognised in his lifetime, and he received several honours and\r\npresents, he entered into prolonged squabbles concerning the discovery\r\nwhich worried him into a state of ill-health, ending in his death in\r\n1868. A monument was erected over his grave by the citizens of Boston,\r\nbearing the following concise description of his achievement:--\r\n\r\n          \"WILLIAM T. G. MORTON,\r\n\r\n  \"Inventor and revealer of anaesthetic inhalation,\r\n  By whom pain in surgery was averted and annulled;\r\n  Before whom in all time surgery was agony,\r\n  Since whom Science has control of Pain.\"\r\n\r\nWhilst the discoverer of nitrous-oxide anaesthesia was dying from\r\nchagrin and inaction, and the revealer of anaesthetic inhalation by\r\nether was wasting time in unworthy disputes concerning priority, and\r\nfruitless endeavours to gain pecuniary reward, a bolder than either\r\nhad taken up the work where they had left it, with the high object of\r\npursuing it until he had for ever established the benefit to humanity\r\nwhich he recognised in it. He went straight forwards and onwards,\r\nstrong in his endeavour; undeterred by the jeers of the ignorant, the\r\nopposition of the prejudiced or the attacks of the jealous, with no\r\nthought of or wish for reward except that which was to come daily from\r\nthe depth of sufferers' hearts.\r\n\r\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1846 Simpson was in London, and\r\ndiscussed the new discovery with Liston, who was one of the first to\r\noperate under ether in Great Britain at University College Hospital.\r\nThe great surgeon thought that the chief application of the process\r\nwould be in the practice of rapidly operating surgeons; it was at\r\nfirst generally believed that the inhalation could be borne for only a\r\nbrief period. Simpson speedily showed that no evil resulted if the\r\npatient remained under the influence of the vapour for hours. In the\r\nmonth of January, 1847, he gained for the Edinburgh Medical School the\r\nproud honour of being the scene of the first use of anaesthetics in\r\nobstetric practice. In March of the same year he published a record of\r\ncases of parturition in which he had used ether with success; and had\r\na large number of copies of his paper printed and distributed far and\r\nwide at home and abroad, so eager was he to popularise amongst the\r\nmembers of his profession the revolutionary practice which he\r\nintroduced. From the day on which he first used ether in midwifery\r\nuntil the end of his career he constantly used anaesthetics in his\r\npractice. He quickly perceived, however, the short-comings of ether,\r\nand having satisfied himself that they were unavoidable, he set about\r\nhis next great step, namely, to discover some substance possessing the\r\nadvantages without the disadvantages of ether. In the midst of his now\r\nimmense daily work he gave all his spare time, often only the midnight\r\nhours, to testing upon himself the effect of numerous drugs. With the\r\nsame courage that had filled Morton he sat down alone, or with Dr.\r\nGeorge Keith and Dr. Matthews Duncan, his assistants, to inhale\r\nsubstance after substance, often to the real alarm of the household at\r\n52, Queen Street. Appeal was made to scientific chemists to provide\r\ndrugs hitherto known only as curiosities of the laboratory, and for\r\nothers that their special knowledge might be able to suggest. The\r\nexperiments usually took place in the dining-room in the quiet of the\r\nevening or the dead of night. The enthusiasts sat at the table and\r\ninhaled the particular substance under trial from tumblers or saucers;\r\nbut the summer of 1847 passed away, and the autumn was commenced\r\nbefore he succeeded in finding any substance which at all fulfilled\r\nhis requirements. All this time he was battling for anaesthesia, which,\r\nparticularly in its application to midwifery, was meeting with what\r\nappears now as an astonishing amount of opposition, on varying grounds\r\nfrom all sorts and conditions of persons; but the vigour and power of\r\nhis advocacy and defence of the practice in the days when laughing-gas\r\nand ether were the only known agents, were as nothing to that which he\r\nexerted after his own discovery at the end of 1847.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion to try chloroform first came from a Mr. Waldie, a\r\nnative of Linlithgowshire, settled in Liverpool as a chemist. It was a\r\n\"curious liquid,\" discovered and described in 1831 by two chemists,\r\nSoubeiran and Liebig, simultaneously but independently. In 1835 its\r\nchemical composition was first accurately ascertained by Dumas, the\r\nfamous French chemist. Simpson was apparently not aware that early in\r\n1847 another French chemist, Flourens, had drawn attention to the\r\neffect of chloroform upon animals, or he would probably have hastened\r\nto use it upon himself experimentally, instead of putting away the\r\nfirst specimen obtained as unlikely; it was heavy and not volatile\r\nlooking, and less attractive to him than other substances. How it\r\nfinally came to be tried is best described in the words of Simpson's\r\ncolleague and neighbour, Professor Miller, who used to look in every\r\nmorning at nine o'clock to see how the enthusiasts had fared in the\r\nexperiments of the previous evening.\r\n\r\n\"Late one evening, it was the 4th of November, 1847, on returning\r\nhome after a weary day's labour, Dr. Simpson with his two friends\r\nand assistants, Drs. Keith and Duncan, sat down to their somewhat\r\nhazardous work in Dr. Simpson's dining-room. Having inhaled several\r\nsubstances, but without much effect, it occurred to Dr. Simpson to\r\ntry a ponderous material which he had formerly set aside on a\r\nlumber-table, and which on account of its great weight he had\r\nhitherto regarded as of no likelihood whatever; that happened to\r\nbe a small bottle of chloroform. It was searched for and recovered\r\nfrom beneath a heap of waste paper. And with each tumbler newly\r\ncharged, the inhalers resumed their vocation. Immediately an\r\nunwonted hilarity seized the party--they became brighteyed, very\r\nhappy, and very loquacious--expatiating on the delicious aroma of\r\nthe new fluid. The conversation was of unusual intelligence, and quite\r\ncharmed the listeners--some ladies of the family and a naval\r\nofficer, brother-in-law of Dr. Simpson. But suddenly there was a\r\ntalk of sounds being heard like those of a cotton mill louder and\r\nlouder; a moment more and then all was quiet--and then crash! On\r\nawakening Dr. Simpson's first perception was mental--'This is far\r\nstronger and better than ether,' said he to himself. His second was to\r\nnote that he was prostrate on the floor, and that among the friends\r\nabout him there was both confusion and alarm. Hearing a noise he\r\nturned round and saw Dr. Duncan beneath a chair--his jaw dropped,\r\nhis eyes staring, his head bent half under him; quite unconscious, and\r\nsnoring in a most determined and alarming manner. More noise still\r\nand much motion. And then his eyes overtook Dr. Keith's feet and legs\r\nmaking valorous attempts to overturn the supper table, or more\r\nprobably to annihilate everything that was on it. By and by Dr.\r\nSimpson having regained his seat, Dr. Duncan having finished his\r\nuncomfortable and unrefreshing slumber, and Dr. Keith having come to\r\nan arrangement with the table and its contents, the _sederunt_ was\r\nresumed. Each expressed himself delighted with this new agent, and\r\nits inhalation was repeated many times that night--one of the ladies\r\ngallantly taking her place and turn at the table--until the supply of\r\nchloroform was fairly exhausted.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady was Miss Petrie, a niece of Mrs. Simpson's; she folded her\r\narms across her breast as she inhaled the vapour, and fell asleep\r\ncrying, \"I'm an angel! Oh, I'm an angel\"! The party sat discussing\r\ntheir sensations, and the merits of the substance long after it was\r\nfinished; they were unanimous in considering that at last something\r\nhad been found to surpass ether.\r\n\r\nThe following morning a manufacturing chemist was pressed into\r\nservice, and had to burn the midnight oil to meet Simpson's demand for\r\nthe new substance. So great was Simpson's midwifery practice that he\r\nwas able to make immediate trial of chloroform, and on November 10th\r\nhe read a paper to the Medico-Chirurgical Society, describing the\r\nnature of his agent, and narrating cases in which he had already\r\nsuccessfully used it. \"I have never had the pleasure,\" he said, \"of\r\nwatching over a series of better and more rapid recoveries; nor once\r\nwitnessed any disagreeable results follow to either mother or child;\r\nwhilst I have now seen an immense amount of maternal pain and agony\r\nsaved by its employment. And I most conscientiously believe that the\r\nproud mission of the physician is distinctly twofold--namely to\r\nalleviate human suffering as well as preserve human life.\" In a\r\npostscript to the same paper he states on November 15th that he had\r\nalready administered chloroform to about fifty individuals without\r\nthe slightest bad result, and gives an account of the first surgical\r\ncases in which he gave the agent to patients of his friends, Professor\r\nMiller and Dr. Duncan, in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. \"A great\r\ncollection,\" he says, \"of professional gentlemen and students\r\nwitnessed the results, and amongst them Professor Dumas, of Paris, the\r\nchemist who first ascertained and established the chemical composition\r\nof chloroform. He happened to be passing through Edinburgh, and was in\r\nno small degree rejoiced to witness the wonderful physiological\r\neffects of a substance with whose chemical history his own name was so\r\nintimately connected.\" Four thousand copies of this paper were sold in\r\na few days, and many thousands afterwards.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of mention that, according to a promise, Professor Miller\r\nhad sent for Simpson a few days after the discovery to give chloroform\r\nto a patient on whom he was about to perform a major operation;\r\nSimpson, however, was unavoidably prevented from attending, and Miller\r\nbegan the operation without him--at the first cut of the knife the\r\npatient fainted and died. It is easy to imagine what a blow to\r\nSimpson, and to the cause of anaesthesia this would have been had it\r\nhappened while the patient was under chloroform.\r\n\r\nThus in little more than a year from the date of Morton's discovery of\r\nthe powers of ether, Simpson had crowned the achievement by the\r\ndiscovery of the equally wonderful and beneficial powers of\r\nchloroform. Already he had made two satisfactory answers to the\r\nquestion he had early set himself--first, the application of\r\nanaesthesia to midwifery practice; and, second, the discovery of the\r\nproperties of the more portable and manageable chloroform; the third,\r\nand perhaps the greatest, the defence of the practice, and the beating\r\ndown of the powerful opposition to anaesthesia was yet required to\r\nrender his reply complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FIGHT FOR ANAESTHESIA. 1847 ONWARDS\r\n\r\n  His faith in chloroform--Confused public opinion on the\r\n  subject--Personal attacks--Opposition on professional\r\n  grounds--His reply--Opposition on moral grounds--His\r\n  reply--Opposition on religious grounds--His reply--Her Majesty\r\n  the Queen anaesthetised--Indiscrete supporters--The Edinburgh\r\n  teaching of anaesthesia administration--The far-reaching effects\r\n  of the successful introduction of anaesthesia.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Simpson firmly believed that he possessed now in chloroform\r\nan anaesthetic agent \"more portable, more manageable and powerful, more\r\nagreeable to inhale, and less exciting\" than ether, and one giving him\r\n\"greater control and command over the superinduction of the anaesthetic\r\nstate.\" Fortified by this belief, full of facts relating to the\r\nsubject, and fired with zeal and enthusiasm, he was prepared to meet\r\nthe opposition which from his knowledge of human nature he must have\r\nanticipated. So bravely and so emphatically did he champion the cause\r\nthat he became identified with it in the public mind. The revelation\r\nof anaesthesia, the discovery of chloroform, and the application of\r\nanaesthetics to surgery as well as to midwifery were attributed to him\r\nby all classes of the community, not even excepting many of his own\r\nprofession. Chloroform was spoken of as if ether had never existed;\r\nand chloroform and chloroforming displaced the terms anaesthetic and\r\nanaesthetising in ordinary talk--such unwieldy terms were naturally\r\nabandoned when there was the excuse that chloroform was universally\r\nconsidered the best substance of its class. Simpson made no attempt as\r\nMorton had done to patent his discovery under a fanciful name for his\r\nown pecuniary profit; but widely spread abroad every particle of\r\nknowledge concerning it that he possessed, so that every practitioner\r\nwas forthwith enabled to avail himself thereof for the benefit of his\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nPartly owing to his own enthusiasm and his strong belief in the\r\nsuperiority of chloroform over ether, and partly owing to the\r\nconfusion prevailing in general circles as to the history of\r\nanaesthesia, no small number of attacks were directed against Simpson\r\npersonally by those who either were jealous of his achievements, or\r\nwho considered that the part taken by themselves or their friends in\r\nthe establishment of this new era in medical science had been slighted\r\nor overlooked. Simpson took all these as part of the fight into which\r\nhe had entered. His nature was not sensitive to such personal\r\nattacks; he replied to them, cast them off, and went on his way\r\nunaffected. He handled some of these opponents somewhat severely when\r\nthey accused him of encouraging the public belief in him as the\r\ndiscoverer of anaesthesia. It is clear to us to-day after anaesthesia\r\nhas been on its trial for fifty years that Simpson magnified the\r\nsuperiority of chloroform over ether, and was led by that feeling to\r\nlook on the history of ether as but a stage in the history of the\r\ngreater chloroform. He regarded chloroform as the only anaesthetic; his\r\nutterances betrayed this feeling, and offence was naturally taken by\r\nthe introducers and advocates of ether. His opinion of chloroform was\r\nshared by the leading European surgeons to such an extent in his day\r\nthat shortly after his death Professor Gusserow, of Berlin, stated\r\nthat with a few exceptions almost all over the earth nothing else was\r\nused to produce anaesthesia but chloroform.\r\n\r\nThe real fight for anaesthesia was against those who found in the\r\npractice something which ran contrary to their beliefs or principles.\r\nThere were first those who objected on purely _medical_ grounds;\r\nsecondly, those who took exception to it from a _moral_ point of view;\r\nand thirdly, those who found their _religious_ convictions seriously\r\noffended by the new practice.\r\n\r\nThe _medical_ opponents were, perhaps, the most powerful; certainly it\r\nwas they who had first to be won over, for without the support of the\r\nprofession the cause was in danger. It was urged first of all that the\r\nuse of anaesthetics would increase the mortality, then very great, of\r\nsurgical operations, and those who took their stand upon this ground\r\nwere men who had at first denied the possibility of making operations\r\npainless, and had been driven to abandon that opinion only by a clear\r\ndemonstration of the fact. To meet this form of opposition he\r\ninstituted a laborious and extensive statistical investigation in\r\norder to compare the results obtained in hospitals where anaesthetics\r\nwere used with those where the operations were performed on patients\r\nin the waking state. He took care that the reports dealt with the same\r\noperations under, as nearly as possible, similar conditions in each\r\ncase. He obtained returns from close upon fifty hospitals in London,\r\nEdinburgh, Dublin, and various provincial towns. One of the most fatal\r\noperations in those days, and one dreaded by patient and surgeon\r\nalike, was amputation of the thigh. In 1845 Professor Syme said that\r\nthe stern evidence of hospital statistics showed that the average\r\nfrequency of death after that operation was not less than 60 to 70 per\r\ncent., or above one in every two operated upon. Simpson fearlessly\r\ncollated statistics of this operation amongst the others, and proved\r\nthat when performed under anaesthetics amputation of the thigh had its\r\nmortality reduced to 25 per cent. His figures were as follows:--\r\n\r\nTABLE OF THE MORTALITY OF AMPUTATIONS OF THE THIGH.\r\n\r\n    Reporter.                     Cases.  Deaths.  % of Deaths.\r\n\r\n  Not anaesthetised.\r\n    Parisian hospitals--Malgaigne    201    126      62 in 100\r\n    Edinburgh   \"     --Peacock       43     21      49  \"\r\n    General collection--Phillips     987    435      44  \"\r\n    Glasgow hospitals --Lawrie       127     46      36  \"\r\n    British     \"     --Simpson      284    107      38  \"\r\n\r\n  Cases on patients in an\r\n   anaesthetised state                145      37     25  \"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the above table as a proof that far from increasing the\r\nmortality of this operation the introduction of anaesthetics had\r\nalready led to a saving of from eleven to twenty lives out of every\r\nhundred cases. He acknowledged that the number of cases he had\r\ncollected (145) was somewhat small from a statistical point of view;\r\nbut he confidently asserted that future figures would show greater\r\ntriumphs. The tables of other operations showed similar results, and\r\nhe entered exhaustively into the subject in a paper published in 1848.\r\nThe paper was entitled, \"Does Anaesthesia increase or decrease the\r\nmortality attendant upon surgical operations?\" According to his wont,\r\nhe headed it with a quotation from Shakspeare:\r\n\r\n  \"Why doest thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\r\n    ... Shylock must be merciful.\r\n  On what compulsion must I? Tell me that!\"\r\n\r\nVictorious in this encounter, he turned to those who urged that\r\nanaesthetics were responsible for various kinds of ills such as a\r\ntendency to haemorrhage, convulsions, paralysis, pneumonia, and various\r\nkinds of inflammatory mischief as well as mental derangement. He\r\ncombated these contentions until the end of his career; and not only\r\nproved that the objections were visionary, but showed that for one of\r\nthe alleged evils formerly often seen after operations, viz.,\r\nconvulsions, chloroform, far from being a cause, was one of our most\r\npowerful remedies.\r\n\r\nBut the professional opponents of anaesthesia were most emphatic in the\r\ndenunciation of its use in midwifery. Pain in the process of\r\nparturition was, they said, \"a desirable, salutary, and conservative\r\nmanifestation of life-force\": neither its violence nor its continuance\r\nwas productive of injury to the constitution. Strong opposition on\r\nthese grounds came from the Dublin School, and with characteristic\r\nboldness Simpson turned to the statistics of their own lying-in\r\nhospital to prove his contention that to abolish parturient pain was\r\nto diminish the peril of the process. Again the statistics stood him\r\nin good stead; he flourished them triumphantly before his opponents,\r\nand proceeded to deal with those who asserted that the use of\r\nanaesthetics was accompanied by danger to life. He pointed out that,\r\nalthough unquestionably there were some dangers connected therewith,\r\nthey were insignificant compared with the dangers in both surgery and\r\nmidwifery which their use averted. Pain itself was a danger; shock in\r\nsurgery was responsible for many untimely deaths upon the operating\r\ntable; by preventing these chloroform saved countless lives. His\r\narguments were characterised by painstaking thoroughness and evidenced\r\nwide reading. In addressing Professor Meigs, of Philadelphia, he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n\"First, I do believe that if improperly and incautiously given, and in\r\nsome rare idiosyncrasies, ether and chloroform may prove injurious or\r\neven fatal--just as opium, calomel, and every other powerful remedy\r\nand strong drug will occasionally do. Drinking cold water itself will\r\nsometimes produce death. 'It is well known,' says Dr. Taylor, in his\r\nexcellent work on Medical Jurisprudence, 'that there are _many_ cases\r\non record in which cold water, swallowed in large quantity and in an\r\nexcited state of the system, has led to the destruction of life.'\r\nShould we therefore never allay our thirst with cold water? What would\r\nthe disciples of Father Mathew say to this? But, secondly, you and\r\nothers have very unnecessary and aggravated fears about the dangers of\r\nether and chloroform, and in the course of experience you will find\r\nthese fears to be, in a great measure, perfectly ideal and imaginary.\r\nBut the same fears have, in the first instance, been conjured up\r\nagainst almost all other innovations in medicine and in the common\r\nluxuries of life. Cavendish, the secretary to Cardinal Wolsey, tells\r\nus in his life of that prelate, that when the cardinal was banished\r\nfrom London to York by his master--that regal Robespierre, Henry the\r\nEighth--_many_ of the cardinal's servants refused to go such an\r\nenormous journey--'for they were loath to abandon their native\r\ncountry, their parents, wives, and children.' The journey which can\r\n_now_ be accomplished in six hours was considered then a perfect\r\nbanishment.... In his Life of Lord Loughborough, John Lord Campbell\r\ntells us that when he (the biographer) first travelled from Edinburgh\r\nto London in the mail-coach the time had been reduced (from the former\r\ntwelve or fourteen days) to three nights and two days; 'but,' he adds,\r\n'this new and swift travelling from the Scots to the English capital\r\nwas wonderful, and I was gravely advised to stop a day at York as\r\nseveral passengers who had gone through without stopping had died of\r\napoplexy from the rapidity of the motion' ('Lives of the Lord\r\nChancellors'). Be assured that many of the cases of apoplexy, &c.,\r\n&c., alleged to arise from ether and chloroform, have as veritable an\r\netiology as this apoplexy from rapid locomotion, and that a few years\r\nhence they will stand in the same light in which we now look back upon\r\nthe apoplexy from travelling ten miles an hour. And as to the supposed\r\ngreat moral and physical evils and injuries arising from the use of\r\nether and chloroform, they will by and by, I believe, sound much in\r\nthe same way as the supposed great moral and physical evils and\r\ninjuries arising from using hackney coaches, which were seriously\r\ndescribed by Taylor, the water-poet, two or three centuries ago when\r\nthese coaches were introduced. Taylor warned his fellow-creatures to\r\navoid them, otherwise 'they would find their bodies tossed, tumbled,\r\nrumbled, and jumbled' without mercy. 'The coach,' says he, 'is a close\r\nhypocrite, for it hath a cover for knavery; they (the passengers) are\r\ncarried back to back in it like people surprised by pirates, and\r\nmoreover it maketh men imitate sea-crabs in being drawn sideways, and\r\naltogether it is a dangerous carriage for the commonwealth.' Then he\r\nproceeds to call them 'hell-carts,' &c., and vents upon them a great\r\ndeal of other abuse very much of the same kind and character as that\r\nlavished against anaesthetics in our own day.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing out the same line of reasoning he brought to the minds of\r\nmedical opponents how the introducers of such useful drugs as mercury,\r\nantimony, and cinchona bark had met with now long-forgotten but\r\nstubborn opposition; and he reminded surgeons of the stern obstinacy\r\nwith which the introduction of the ligature of arteries had been long\r\nobjected to and the barbarous method of arresting bleeding with\r\nred-hot irons had been preferred. But in the history of the discovery\r\nand introduction of vaccination by Jenner he found a strong parallel;\r\nand he wrote a pregnant article to prove that mere opinion and\r\nprejudgments were not sufficient to settle the question of the\r\npropriety or impropriety of anaesthetic agents, illustrating it from\r\nthe story of vaccination. The result of vaccination had been to save\r\nduring the half century since its introduction a number of lives in\r\nEngland alone equal to the whole existing population of Wales; and in\r\nEurope during the same period it had preserved a number of lives\r\ngreater than the whole existing population of Great Britain. And yet\r\nJenner, when he first announced his discovery, had encountered the\r\nmost determined opposition on the part of many of his professional\r\nbrethren, who ridiculed and bitterly denounced both him and his\r\ndiscovery; whilst ignorant laymen announced that smallpox was ordained\r\nby heaven and vaccination was a daring and profane violation of holy\r\nreligion. He pointed out that these objections had been slowly and\r\nsurely crushed out of existence by accumulated facts, and predicted\r\nthat the ultimate decision concerning anaesthesia would come to be\r\nbased, not upon impressions, opinions, and prejudices, but upon the\r\nevidence of \"a sufficient body of accurate and well-ascertained\r\nfacts.\" To these facts, as has been indicated, he subsequently\r\nsuccessfully appealed.\r\n\r\nThose who objected to anaesthesia on _moral_ grounds directed their\r\nattacks chiefly against its use in midwifery. They not only condemned\r\nthat application as iniquitous, but went the length of asserting that\r\nthe birth of past myriads without it proved how unnecessary it was,\r\nand that Nature conducted the whole process of birth unaided in a\r\ngreatly superior manner. The pains associated with parturition were\r\nactually beneficial, they said. Simpson answered this by showing that\r\nthe proper use of anaesthetics shortened parturition, and by\r\ndiminishing the amount of pain led to more rapid and more perfect\r\nrecoveries. The leading exponent of the Dublin School of Midwifery at\r\nthat time foolishly wrote that he did not think any one in Dublin had\r\nas yet used anaeesthetics in midwifery; that the feeling was very\r\nstrong against its use in ordinary cases, merely to avert the ordinary\r\namount of pain, which the Almighty had seen fit--and most wisely, no\r\ndoubt--to allot to natural labour; and in this feeling he (the writer)\r\nmost heartily concurred. Simpson's private comment on this remarkable\r\nepistle at once showed his opinion of it, and ridiculed the objection\r\nout of existence. He skilfully parodied the letter thus:--\"I do not\r\nbelieve that any one in Dublin has as yet used a carriage in\r\nlocomotion; the feeling is very strong against its use in ordinary\r\nprogression, merely to avert the ordinary amount of fatigue which the\r\nAlmighty has seen fit--and most wisely, no doubt--to allot to natural\r\nwalking; and in this feeling I heartily and entirely concur.\"\r\n\r\nHe twitted the surgeons who opposed him with their sudden discovery,\r\nnow that anaesthetics were introduced, that there was something really\r\nbeneficial in the pain and agony caused by their dreaded knife. Such a\r\ncontention contraverted his cherished principle that the function of\r\nthe medical man was not only to prolong life, but also to alleviate\r\nhuman sufferings. He quoted authorities of all times to show that\r\npain had been always abhorred by physicians and surgeons, commencing\r\nwith a reference to Galen's aphorism--\"_Dolor dolentibus inutile est_\"\r\n(\"pain is useless to the pained\"); citing Ambroise Pare, who said that\r\npain ought to be assuaged because nothing so much dejected the powers\r\nof the patient; and, finally, reproducing the words of modern authors,\r\nwho asserted that, far from being conducive to well-being, pain\r\nexhausted the principle of life, and in itself was frequently both\r\ndangerous and destructive. He brought forward a collection of cases\r\nwhere in former days patients had died on the operating-table, even\r\nbefore the surgeon had begun his work, so great was the influence of\r\nthe mere fear of pain; and reminded those who attributed occasional\r\ndeaths on the operating-table to the influence of the anaesthetic of\r\nthe numerous cases in bygone days where death occurred whilst the\r\nsurgeon was at work. He recalled also how the great surgeon of St.\r\nThomas's Hospital, Cheselden, had abhorred the pain which he caused in\r\nthe process of his work, and longed for some means for its prevention.\r\n\"No one,\" said Cheselden, \"ever endured more anxiety and sickness\r\nbefore an operation\" than himself.\r\n\r\nSimpson did not forget to look at the subject from the patient's point\r\nof view, and reproduced the letter from an old patient, which has been\r\nalready quoted (Chapter VI.).\r\n\r\nThe soldier and sailor, brave unto heroism in facing the enemy, never\r\nfearing the death which stared them in the face in its most horrible\r\nform whilst answering the call of duty, would quail like children at\r\nthe mere thought of submitting to the deliberate knife of the\r\nsurgeon. Were quibbles about the efficacy of pain to stand in the way\r\nof the merciful prevention of such suffering by the process of\r\nanaesthetisation?\r\n\r\nThose who opposed him with this curious idea, that pain after all was\r\nbeneficial, were some of them men of no mean standing in the\r\nprofession. Gull, Bransby Cooper, and Nunn were amongst those whom\r\nhe had to silence. After replying to their arguments _seriatim_ with\r\nall his polemic power, he referred them once more to the evidence\r\nof facts and of facts alone as set forth by his statistics. Had he\r\nlived but a twelvemonth longer than he did he would have been able\r\nto conjure up a picture of the incalculable amount of suffering\r\nprevented by the eighteen hundred pounds of chloroform which were\r\nforwarded to the rival armies from one firm of chemists alone during\r\nthe Franco-Prussian war; happily for the wounded within and around\r\nParis, there was then no longer any doubt as to the propriety of\r\nemploying anaesthetics.\r\n\r\nThe _religious_ objections to the use of anaesthetics could scarcely be\r\nmet with statistics. Foolish as they now appear to us after the lapse\r\nof time, and with the practice they attempted to repel universally\r\nadopted, they were nevertheless urged in good faith by clergy and\r\nlaity of various denominations. The same kind of bigotry had met the\r\nintroduction of vaccination, and Simpson himself remembered how many\r\npeople had opposed the emancipation of the negroes on the ground that\r\nthey were the lineal descendants of Ham, of whom it was said \"a\r\nservant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" Sir Walter Scott\r\nreminds us, in \"Old Mortality,\" of the spirit which met the\r\nintroduction of fanners to separate the chaff from the corn, which\r\ndisplaced the ancient method of tossing the corn in the air upon broad\r\nshovels. Headrigg reproved Lady Bellenden for allowing the new process\r\nto be used on her farm, \"thus impiously thwarting the will of Divine\r\nProvidence by raising a wind for your leddyship's ain particular use\r\nby human art, instead of soliciting it by prayer or waiting patiently\r\nfor whatever dispensation of wind Providence was pleased to send upon\r\nthe sheeling hill.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day in South Africa the same spirit is seen. Honest countryfolk of\r\nEuropean descent are earnestly counselled by their spiritual advisers\r\nto submit patiently to the plague of locusts on the ground that it\r\ncomes as a punishment from Providence. These worthy men stolidly\r\nwitness their cornfields and their grass lands being eaten bare before\r\ntheir eyes in a few hours, whilst their more enlightened neighbours,\r\nbrought up in another faith, resort with success to all sorts of\r\nartifices to ward off the destructive little invaders.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to be able to record that Dr. Chalmers, one of the\r\nheroes of Scots religious history, not only countenanced chloroform\r\nby witnessing operations performed under it in the Royal Infirmary,\r\nbut when requested to deal in a magazine article with the theological\r\naspect of anaeesthesia refused on the ground that the question had no\r\ntheological aspect, and advised Simpson and his friends to take no\r\nheed of the \"small theologians\" who advocated such views. This was\r\nfutile advice to give to one of Professor Simpson's controversial\r\npropensities; he entered with keen enjoyment into the fray with these\r\n\"religious\" opponents. His famous pamphlet, entitled, \"Answer to the\r\nReligious Objections advanced against the employment of Anaeesthetic\r\nAgents in Midwifery and Surgery,\" fought his enemies with their own\r\nweapons by appealing with consummate skill to Scripture for\r\nauthority for the practice. The paper was headed with two scriptural\r\nverses:--\"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be\r\nrefused if it be received with thanksgiving\" (1 Timothy iv. 4).\r\n\"Therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it\r\nis sin\" (James iv. 17).\r\n\r\nThe principal standpoint of the religious opponents was the primeval\r\ncurse upon womanhood to be found in Genesis. Simpson swept the ground\r\nfrom under his opponents' feet by reference to and study of the\r\noriginal Hebrew text. The word translated--\"sorrow\" (\"I will greatly\r\nmultiply thy sorrow ... in sorrow shalt thou bring forth\")--was the\r\nsame as that rendered as \"sorrow\" in the curse applied to man (\"in\r\nsorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life\"). Not only did\r\nthe Hebrew word thus translated sorrow really mean labour, toil, or\r\nphysical exertion; but in other parts of the Bible an entirely\r\ndifferent Hebrew word was used to express the actual pain incident to\r\nparturition. The contention, then, that sorrow in the curse meant pain\r\nwas valueless. Chloroform relieved the real pain not referred to in\r\nthe curse, whereas it had no effect upon the sorrow or physical\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the curse was to be taken literally in its application to\r\nwoman as these persons averred, and granting for the moment that\r\nsorrow did mean pain, their position was entirely illogical. If one\r\npart of the curse was to be interpreted literally, so must be the\r\nother parts, and this would have a serious effect of a revolutionary\r\nnature upon man and the human race all over the face of the earth.\r\nLiterally speaking, the curse condemned the farmer who pulled up his\r\nthorns and thistles, as well as the man who used horses or oxen,\r\nwater-power, or steam-traction to perform the work by which he earned\r\nhis bread; for was he not thereby saving the sweat of his face?\r\n\r\nPushed further, the same argument rendered these contentions more\r\nabsurd and untenable. Man was condemned to die--\"dust thou art\r\nand unto dust thou shalt return.\" What right had the physician or\r\nsurgeon to use his skill to prolong life, at the same time that he\r\nconscientiously abstained from the use of anaesthetics on the\r\nground that they obviated pain sent by the Deity? Nay, more; sin\r\nitself was the result of the Fall; was not the Church herself\r\nerroneously labouring to turn mankind from sin?\r\n\r\nIn a truer and more serious religious spirit he reminded his foolish\r\nopponents of the Christian dispensation, and pointed out how the\r\nemployment of anaesthesia was in strict consonance with the glorious\r\nspirit thereof.\r\n\r\nSome persons broadly stated that the new process was unnatural; even\r\nthese he condescended to answer. \"How unnatural,\" exclaimed an Irish\r\nlady, \"for you doctors in Edinburgh to take away the pains of your\r\npatients.\" \"How unnatural,\" said he, \"it is for you to have swam over\r\nfrom Ireland to Scotland against wind and tide in a steam-boat.\"\r\n\r\nA son of De Quincey in his graduation thesis humorously supported\r\nProfessor Simpson. He argued that the unmarried woman who opposed\r\nanaesthetics on the ground that her sex was condemned by the curse to\r\nsuffer pains, broke the command herself \"in four several ways,\r\naccording to the following tabular statement\":--\r\n\r\n\"1. She has no conception.\r\n\r\n2. She brings forth no children.\r\n\r\n3. Her desire is not to her husband.\r\n\r\n4. The husband does not rule over her.\"\r\n\r\nDe Quincey himself supported his son in a letter appended to the\r\nthesis thus:--\"If pain when carried to the stage which we call agony\r\nor intense struggle amongst vital functions brings with it some danger\r\nto life, then it will follow that knowingly to reject a means of\r\nmitigating or wholly cancelling the danger now that such means has\r\nbeen discovered and tested, travels on the road towards suicide. It is\r\neven worse than an ordinary movement in that direction, because it\r\nmakes God an accomplice, through the Scriptures, in this suicidal\r\nmovement, nay, the primal instigator to it, by means of a supposed\r\ncurse interdicting the use of any means whatever (though revealed by\r\nHimself) for annulling that curse.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Bible furnished Simpson with the most powerful argument of all\r\nin Genesis ii. 21, where it is written: \"And the Lord God caused a\r\ndeep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept; and He took one of his\r\nribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof.\" He strengthened his\r\nposition by explaining that the word rendered \"deep sleep\" might more\r\ncorrectly be translated \"coma\" or \"lethargy.\" He had taken the full\r\nmeasure of his opponents when he answered them with this quotation; it\r\nwas a reply characteristic of the man, and completely defeated these\r\nself-constituted theologians with their own weapons. They had attacked\r\nhim as a man of science, and found that his knowledge of the\r\nScriptures excelled their own. He did not fail to read these people a\r\nlesson, and point out the harm done to true religion by such conduct\r\nand arguments as theirs, reminding them that if God had willed pain to\r\nbe irremovable no possible device of man could ever have removed it.\r\n\r\nSuch was the great fight--the fight for anaesthesia--which Simpson\r\nfought and won. He was the one man who by his own individual effort\r\nestablished the practice of anaesthesia, while Morton has the honour of\r\nbeing the one man without whom anaesthesia might have remained unknown.\r\nSuch was the opposition encountered, and such was the timidity of his\r\nprofessional brethren, that but for Simpson's courageous efforts it\r\nwould have been the work of years to bring about what it was granted\r\nto him to accomplish in a brief period; if fear, ridicule, contempt,\r\nand bigotry had not perhaps sunk the new practice into oblivion. Of\r\nthe hundreds who are daily mercifully brought under the influence of\r\nchloroform and ether, few are aware what they owe to Simpson, even if\r\nthey know how great is the suffering which they are spared.\r\n\r\nSimpson felt that the victory was indeed complete when in April, 1853,\r\nhe received a letter from Sir James Clark, physician in ordinary to\r\nHer Majesty, informing him that the Queen had been brought under the\r\ninfluence of chloroform, and had expressed herself as greatly pleased\r\nwith the result. It was at the birth of the late Prince Leopold that\r\nHer Majesty set her subjects this judicious example.\r\n\r\nMuch trouble to the cause was occasioned by enthusiasts who\r\nadministered chloroform with more zeal than discretion, and\r\nwithout any study of the principles laid down by Simpson. As a result\r\nof imperfect trials, some persons went the length of saying that\r\nthere were people whom it was impossible to anaesthetise at all, and\r\nothers who could be only partially anaesthetised. Wrong methods of\r\nadministration were used. Simpson patiently corrected these, and\r\ncarefully instructed his students, so that the young graduates of\r\nEdinburgh University carried his teaching and practice into all\r\nparts of the world. Syme also took up the cause, and valuable work\r\nwas done in London by Snow, and later by Clover. The teaching of\r\nSimpson and Syme led to such successful results that their methods\r\nare followed by the Edinburgh School to this day practically\r\nunaltered. So satisfactory an agent is chloroform in Edinburgh\r\nhands, that other anaesthetics are in that city but rarely called\r\ninto requisition. All the world over it is the anaesthetic in which\r\nthe general practitioner places his trust.\r\n\r\nHaving seen what Simpson did for anaesthesia, we may briefly review\r\nwhat anaesthesia has done for humanity. That it has entirely abolished\r\nthe pain attendant upon surgery is easily recognised by the profession\r\nand patients alike. The patient never begs for mercy nowadays; he\r\ndreads the anaesthetic more than the knife; he has no anxiety as to\r\nwhether he will feel pain or not, but rather as to whether he will\r\ncome round when the operation is over; happily after one experience he\r\nrealises that his fears were unfounded, and, if need be, will submit\r\ncheerfully to a second administration.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the operating-room referred to in the preceding chapter\r\nwere vanquished with the pain; the surgeon has no longer to steel\r\nhimself for the task as formerly, to wear a stern aspect and adopt a\r\nharsh manner. The patient has no longer to be held down by assistants;\r\ninstead of having to be dragged unwillingly to the operating-table--a\r\ndaily occurrence sickening to the hearts of fellow-patients and\r\nstudents, while it served only to harden the surgeon and the\r\nexperienced old nurse of those days--he will walk quietly to the room,\r\nor submit patiently to be carried there, and at a word from the\r\nsurgeon prepare\r\n\r\n          \"... to storm\r\n  The thick, sweet mystery of chloroform,\r\n  The drunken dark, the little death-in-life.\"\r\n\r\nThe operation is no longer a race against time; order, method,\r\ncleanliness, and silence prevail, where there was formerly disorder,\r\nbustle, confusion, dirt, and long-drawn shrieks. Nothing illustrates\r\nbetter the progress of surgery than a picture of the operating-room in\r\nthe first decade placed beside that of an operating theatre in one of\r\nour leading hospitals in this the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In the quiet of the patient, in the painlessness of the\r\noperation, in the calm deliberation of the operator, and the\r\nmethodical order of all around him, in the respectful silence that\r\nprevails in the room so soon as the patient is laid on the table, we\r\nsee the direct results of the introduction of anaesthetics. But there\r\nare other great, if less direct, results, each making its presence\r\nknown to the professional spectator. By anaesthesia successful\r\noperations previously unheard of and unthought of were made possible\r\nafter the principle of antiseptic surgery had been established; by\r\nanaesthesia experimental research, which has led to numerous beneficent\r\nresults in practical surgery and medicine, was made possible. Its\r\nintroduction is an achievement of which the Anglo-Saxon race may well\r\nbe proud. Wells, Morton, and Simpson are its heroes. The United States\r\nhas by far the greater share of the honour of its discovery; but to\r\nScotland is due the glory which comes from the victorious fight. No\r\nevent in surgery up to 1847 had had such far-reaching effects. Simpson\r\nhimself looked forward to the discovery of some agent, better than\r\nboth chloroform and ether; and it is still possible that there may be\r\nan even greater future in store for anaesthesia than was ever dreamt of\r\nin his philosophy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE--CONTROVERSIES\r\n\r\n  The foundations of his fame; Comparison with Boerhaave--Family\r\n  letters--Home amusements--Affection for children--And for\r\n  animals--Puck--Holidays--Wide area of practice--\"The arrows of\r\n  malignancy\"--Squabbles--Homoeopathy--Mesmerism--Refuses to leave\r\n  Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat as was Simpson's contemporary fame, the chief part of it had its\r\norigin in his indescribable personal power over his fellows, and in\r\nhis inexhaustible energy. When to these was added the reputation won\r\nby the discovery of chloroform's anaesthetic properties, he stood not\r\nonly as the most famous physician of his day, but also as a man marked\r\nout for posthumous fame. The personal characteristics of the man were\r\nspeedily forgotten after his death, save by those who had been brought\r\nunder their influence; the marked prominence given to Simpson and the\r\n\"discovery of chloroform\" in the numerous recent reviews of Queen\r\nVictoria's reign on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee, indicates\r\nthat it is by chloroform that Simpson will ever be remembered. His\r\nlasting reputation depends on this work, not upon the characteristics\r\nwhich made him famous in the judgment of his contemporaries. The only\r\nphysician in comparatively modern times, whose reputation approached\r\nSimpson's in magnitude was Hermann Boerhaave (1668 to 1738), the Dutch\r\nphysician, whose fame and influence during his own lifetime were\r\nimmense. Boerhaave's leading characteristics greatly resembled\r\nSimpson's: he had an enormous capacity for acquiring information, and\r\na wonderful facility for imparting instruction to others; his energy\r\nand industry were indefatigable, and his memory prodigious. He taught\r\nfrom separate chairs in Leyden the Theory of Medicine, the Practice of\r\nMedicine, Botany, Chemistry, and Clinical Medicine, and at the same\r\ntime carried on his large practice. Patients of both sexes flocked to\r\nhim from all quarters of the globe, and he is said to have accumulated\r\nfrom his practice a fortune of L200,000 in five and thirty years.\r\nAlthough his treatment and method were, according to our modern\r\nknowledge, unscientific, his success in practice was as great as\r\nSimpson's; it sprang from the same cause; a wonderful magnetic\r\npersonal influence, which commanded confidence and faith, so that he\r\nsucceeded with the same possibly quite simple means which were\r\nfruitless in the hands of others. In his day all Europe rang with\r\nBoerhaave's name. To-day he is practically unknown. His books are\r\nantiquated, and if known, are neglected by modern physicians. He\r\nachieved nothing of lasting benefit to humanity. His fate, at least so\r\nfar as the public is concerned, would undoubtedly have been Simpson's,\r\nin spite of his obstetric and gynaecological work, had it not been for\r\nthe discovery of chloroform.\r\n\r\nThe increased fame and greatly increased professional income which\r\nfollowed the successful struggle for anaesthesia did not affect\r\nSimpson's homely characteristics. He found time in the midst of it all\r\nto enjoy the pleasures of home in the society of those he loved best,\r\nand of intimate friends. He took a keen delight in quite the smallest\r\nenjoyments of the home circle. A characteristic letter was written to\r\nhis wife in the summer of 1849; she had gone with the children to the\r\nIsle of Man; he told her the great and small events of his daily\r\nlife:--\r\n\r\n\"Delighted to hear from you that all were so well. Everything goes on\r\nnicely here. I have been looking out for a headache (but keep\r\nexcellently well), for I have been working very busily, and scarcely\r\nwith enough of sleep. Yesterday _beat_ (as Clark writes it) any day I\r\never yet saw in the house. Did not get out till half-past four, and\r\nthe drawing-room actually filled beyond the number of chairs and\r\nseats! Have had a capital sleep, and got up to look at the ducks; but\r\nnone laying this morning, so I write instead. To-day I have a fancy to\r\nrun out to Bathgate, and I think I will.... Yesterday dined with\r\nMiller, and Williamson, the Duke of Buccleuch's huntsman, enlightened\r\nus about dogs. Miller and I go to Hamilton Palace on Saturday.... My\r\nducks won't lay any more eggs, at which I feel very chagrined.... Two\r\nsalmon came as presents last week. I gave one to Mrs. Bennet. We are\r\nbeginning a new batch of examinations at the college. _Such_ a sleep\r\nas I had yesterday morning! I came home by the last Glasgow train,\r\n_very_ tired. Tom came to waken me at eight, but I snored so that he\r\ndidn't. He called me at half-past nine. I don't think I had stirred\r\nfrom the moment I lay down. This morning I have been reading in bed\r\nsince six. I did not rise till now (half-past seven), because there\r\nwas no duck laying.\"\r\n\r\nIn another letter written on the same occasion he says:--\r\n\r\n\"... Tell Davie I expect a letter from him. Say to Walter that\r\nyesterday Carlo jumped into the carriage after me and saw with me\r\nseveral patients. He usually mounted a chair at the side of each bed\r\nand looked in. But Mrs. S. gave him too much encouragement. He leaped\r\ninto bed altogether and tramped upon a blister! which was very\r\npainful.\"\r\n\r\nIt was his custom to keep open house at breakfast and luncheon time;\r\nbut the evening meal was, as a rule, reserved so that he might see and\r\nenjoy his own family and intimates. He lived exceedingly plainly\r\nhimself; he did not smoke; his drink was water: but he delighted in\r\nsetting a goodly repast before his guests. He loved a romp with his\r\nchildren, and spared an occasional hour from the afternoon for that\r\nenjoyment. The same energy entered into his play that was seen in his\r\nwork. A craze ran through fashionable circles in the fifties for\r\n_tableaux vivants_, and was taken up by the Simpson household. He\r\nentered with spirit into the new amusement, perhaps more keenly\r\nbecause he saw an opportunity of combining in such representations\r\ninstruction with amusement. Historical personages and scenes were\r\nrepresented, as well as illustrations of poetry and fiction. With his\r\ninfective enthusiasm he pressed poets and painters, grave and gay,\r\ninto service, and there is a record of one highly successful\r\nentertainment at 52, Queen Street, in 1854, to which young and old\r\nalike were invited. On this occasion most of the scenes represented\r\nserious events in Scots history, but Simpson himself seems to have\r\nsupplied a little comedy. Sandwiched between a scene of \"Flora\r\nMacdonald watching Prince Charlie\" and one of \"Rebecca and Eleazar at\r\nthe Well\" came that of \"The Babes in the Wood.\" Simpson and a\r\nprofessional colleague disported themselves as the Babes, and appeared\r\nsucking oranges and dressed as children--short dresses, pinafores,\r\nfrilled drawers, white socks, and children's shoes. They wandered\r\nabout a while, and then lay weeping down to die to an accompaniment of\r\nroars of laughter and to the great delight of the juveniles. It is\r\nbut a small incident to chronicle, but it shows in his home life the\r\ngreat physician who was beloved by thousands. His deep sympathies made\r\nhim delight in the society of children. As years increased, and with\r\nthem work became overwhelming and worries and troubles persistent, he\r\nappreciated more and more the refreshment of a frolic with his\r\nchildren. He echoed Longfellow's pure words:--\r\n\r\n  \"Come to me, oh ye children,\r\n    For I hear you at your play,\r\n  And the questions that perplexed me\r\n    Have vanished quite away.\r\n\r\n  . . . . . . . . . .\r\n\r\n  For what are all our contrivings,\r\n    And the wisdom of our books,\r\n  When compared with your caresses\r\n    And the gladness of your looks.\"\r\n\r\nHis affectionate disposition and kindly manner gained the devotion of\r\nhis many child patients; and his own family bereavements made him a\r\nsympathetic physician and friend to many a sorrowing mother. There was\r\nno cant or affectation in his sympathy; it grew out of his large\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnimals also he was fond of and gentle to, as we know from the history\r\nof the dogs who successively reigned in the household, so charmingly\r\ngiven to us by his daughter. One episode in the life of Puck, a black\r\nand tan terrier more intelligent than \"breedy,\" deserves repetition.\r\nThe dog had accompanied the Professor and some of his children into\r\nthe country one afternoon on an expedition to dig for antiquarian\r\nrelics. \"After tea Puck, seeing every one carrying something to the\r\nstation, demanded the honour of relieving his master of a _Lancet_,\r\nand went off with his small burden looking very important.... At the\r\nstation the dog was missing. All got into their places but Puck. 'I\r\nwill follow in the next train,' said the Professor; 'Puck is too dear\r\na little friend to lose....' All he found of Puck was a muddy\r\n_Lancet_, and the last that had been seen of the old dog was that he\r\nwas pushing his way through a crowd of idle colliers, where it was\r\nsupposed his energies had been so engrossed in guarding the _Lancet_\r\nthat he had lost sight of his party.... His master stayed there until\r\nnext morning, and some remembered afterwards how Puck's loss gave them\r\nanother evening's talk with one they loved, though he broke in on the\r\nreminiscences with 'I wonder where little Puck is,' or 'Is that his\r\nbark?' No Puck came to demand entrance, and hope of his return was\r\ngiven up after three days passing without news of him. His master was\r\nthinking of the sorrowful letter he would have to write to Puck's\r\ncompanions when late one night, as he paced wearily up and down the\r\nroom, he thought he heard a faint bark. There had been a great deal of\r\nlistening of late for the little dog's bark; but it seemed vain to\r\nthink of Puck's retracing his steps through an unknown country for so\r\nmany miles. Still the Professor opened the door and called. Up the\r\narea steps something did limp into the hall. That it was Puck seemed\r\ndoubtful at first, for he was quick and bright, and this animal was a\r\nlame ball of mud hardly able to crawl. The bright eyes, however, were\r\nPuck's; and he confirmed his identity by exerting his remaining\r\nenergies to give one leap gratefully to kiss the friendly face that\r\nbent over him.... His truant play-fellows received a long letter from\r\ntheir father telling them of Puck's adventure and imagining Puck's\r\nfeelings and trials through his long wanderings.... That letter always\r\nrecalls Puck and his never-resting master bending over his desk,\r\ndespite press of business, to send the news to Puck's companions.\"\r\n\r\nSimpson looked no further than his own nursery and circle of close\r\nfriends for the refreshment and recreation which nature demanded in\r\nthe course of his busy daily life. But holidays were necessary\r\nsometimes. He exhibited all the aversion of an enthusiastically\r\nbusy man to leaving his work, but would yield sometimes to the\r\nsolicitations of friends and would more readily leave his patients for\r\na time if a prospect was held out of some interesting archaeological\r\nresearch to be indulged in. In 1850 he suffered from an abscess,\r\ncaused by blood-poisoning contracted during professional work. At\r\nthe request of his friends Professor Syme was called in, somewhat\r\nto the chagrin of Simpson's old friend and colleague, Miller. It is\r\ninteresting to note that in spite of the recent controversy on\r\nanaesthetics, Montgomery of Dublin, who had keenly opposed him, was\r\namongst the first to write a sympathetic note on hearing of his\r\nillness; although dissenting from some of Simpson's professional\r\nutterances, Montgomery was influenced by the Professor's personality\r\nto respect him as a man and a worker.\r\n\r\nAfter this illness Simpson took a rapid run round the Continent,\r\nvisiting those cities where anything professional was to be picked up.\r\nAs he expressed it himself he \"scampered\" round the Universities,\r\nMuseums, and Hospitals, seeing and hearing all that was to be seen and\r\nheard. He stowed away the newly acquired knowledge in the recesses of\r\nhis mighty brain, and hastened on to the next place of interest before\r\nhis companions had gained their breath sufficiently to regard with\r\nintelligent interest the objects he had already left behind. In Paris,\r\non the occasion of one of his flying visits into a hospital, he was\r\npresent at an operation, unknown to the surgeon, in which chloroform\r\nwas used not only as a preventive of pain, but also for its remedial\r\neffect; after the operation the surgeon addressed his students upon\r\nthe subject of chloroform, and Simpson had the pleasure of listening\r\nto a hearty eulogy of it. When, at the end, he handed in his card, the\r\noperator's delight was genuine and effusive, and the students\r\nenthusiastically appreciated the somewhat dramatic scene. On such\r\noccasions when he had to submit to the embraces of delighted foreign\r\nscientists, the exuberant manner in which they kissed him was not to\r\nhis liking; even the remote strain of French blood in his own veins\r\ndid not help him to enjoy the Continental mode of salutation. All over\r\nEurope his name was honoured and revered. It is said that when in\r\nlater years an Edinburgh citizen was presented at the Court of Denmark\r\nthe King remarked, \"You come from Edinburgh? Ah! Sir Simpson was of\r\nEdinburgh!\"\r\n\r\nThe last trip to the Continent, indeed his last real holiday, was\r\ntaken in 1868, when he ran over to Rome. So public was the life he\r\nled, such matters of interest to his fellow-countrymen were his\r\ncomings and goings, that the _Scotsman_ newspaper chronicled his\r\ndoings, relating the sights and places of interest which he visited,\r\nand noting that his professional services were taken advantage of by\r\nmany Roman citizens during the few days that he was there; and that if\r\ntime had permitted a public reception would have been given to him. In\r\nall his foreign trips his object was to learn, not to teach; he\r\nfollowed Sir Isaac Newton's advice to Ashton, and let his discourse be\r\nmore in queries than in assertions or disputings. He took care neither\r\nto seem much wiser nor much more ignorant than his company.\r\n\r\nSometimes feeling the need of rest himself he would take one or\r\nperhaps three days for a rapid run to the Lakes, or would spend\r\nanother in the country unearthing some antiquarian object. It was\r\nalways a pleasure to him to visit Bathgate, where his uncle and\r\nfriend Alexander had latterly resigned the baker's business and taken\r\nup the _role_ of banker. One of his favourite resorts was a small\r\nhouse called Viewbank which he had taken, situated on the shores of\r\nthe Firth of Forth. Here he was close to the fishing village of\r\nNewhaven; the fisher folks--the men and the picturesquely attired\r\n\"fish-wives\"--a sturdy and original set of people, were a great\r\ninterest to him. They knew him well both as an occasional visitor and\r\nas the good physician.\r\n\r\nOne of his letters written in 1856 gives an indication of the wide\r\narea over which his services were requisitioned and rendered.\r\n\r\n  \"_Sunday._\r\n\r\n  \"I write this at Viewbank, which is very pretty this afternoon,\r\n  but where I have not been for a week or more. This year I have not\r\n  yet had one single holiday, and scarcely expect one now. I have\r\n  had many long runs during the past few months. I have been often\r\n  up in England, professionally, during the summer; once as far as\r\n  Brighton seeing a consumptive case; once at Scarboro' where my\r\n  wife went with me; once or twice in London where I saw the Queen;\r\n  once at Ambleside. I long and weary for a _real_ jaunt without a\r\n  sick patient lying at the end of it. And I had a great fancy to\r\n  run from Manchester to Douglas and send all the patients far\r\n  enough; I have been too hard worked to write, but I _must_ write\r\n  one or two papers now. Queen Street has been a little hotel\r\n  during the summer--always some sick lady or another sleeping in\r\n  it, sometimes several at night.\"\r\n\r\nEven on these professional journeys he found time to examine objects\r\nof interest in the neighbourhood; or if he was unable to leave the\r\nimmediate proximity of his patient, he brought pen and paper to the\r\nbedside and worked while he waited; thus he economised time as he\r\nadvised his students always to do. It is doubtful if any one less\r\ngreat than Simpson would have ever been allowed to labour thus by a\r\nsufferer's bedside; indeed even he was not always permitted to do so.\r\nIt is recorded that, at least, one lady rose hastily and seized his\r\npen so that he was obliged to desist.\r\n\r\nThe striking form with which Nature had endowed him, became more\r\nremarkable when affected by years, work, and domestic afflictions.\r\nThough of medium height his presence, even beside typically large-built\r\nand large-boned fellow-countrymen, was never insignificant. His\r\nfeatures, overhung by his massive forehead, surrounded by the long and\r\nthick hair, spoke his character. Firm, concentrated mouth and piercing\r\neyes, when his mind was fixed on a scientific or practical object. A\r\nsoft, womanly tenderness about the lips, and a genial, sympathetic\r\nemotion in his deep-set eyes when aroused by an object of pity or\r\npleasure. His hand was \"broad and powerful, but the fingers were\r\npointed and specially sensitive of touch.\" To see him was to see one of\r\nthe sights of the modern Athens. His features are familiar to us\r\nto-day as one of the ring of brilliant, intellectual faces forming a\r\nframe to the picture of Queen Victoria in this the year of her Diamond\r\nJubilee--a year of triumphant retrospection, unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of nations.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible that a man holding Simpson's position, engaged in\r\nhis work, and possessed of distinct fighting characteristics, should\r\nnot make enemies. He could say, as Jenner said before him, \"As for\r\nfame, what is it? A gilded butt for ever pierced by the arrows of\r\nmalignancy. The name of John Hunter stamps this observation with the\r\nsignature of truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrows of malignancy did not hurt Simpson. He was very little, if\r\nat all, affected by them; but he paid, perhaps, more attention to them\r\nthan we might have expected him to pay; certainly more than they\r\ndeserved. His love of the fray led him oftentimes to answer what had\r\nbetter have been left unnoticed, and dragged him into prolonged,\r\nsometimes bitter, and, it is to be regretted, often unworthy,\r\ncontroversies. There was so much valuable work to be done, and his\r\nefforts were always so fruitful in result that we grudge the time\r\nspent in these squabbles; there arises an instinctive feeling that had\r\nhe devoted the energy wasted in these contests to furthering some\r\nsingle branch of science, he would have made distinct advances\r\ntherein. There was nothing superficial about his work; whatever the\r\nobject it was thoroughly entered into; his writings convey to one a\r\nsense of the power he had of seeing all round and through a question,\r\nand of weighing and judging evidence. There was likewise no scamping\r\nin his mode of treating his opponents in these squabbles; he used his\r\nweapons fearlessly and administered many a trouncing to weak\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of upheaval in things medical. The microscope and\r\nstethoscope had been introduced into the science and practice of the\r\nhealing art. Scientific experiment and research were beginning to lay\r\nthe foundations of rational medicine and surgery. Edinburgh was in the\r\nfront rank of modern progress, as she has ever been. Men like Simpson,\r\nSyme, Miller, Alison, and Christison, were not likely to lag behind.\r\nBut, unfortunately, it was equally unlikely that such great minds\r\ncould all think alike in matters concerning the principles of the\r\nscience and art which they taught and practised. Thus it happened that\r\nthe Edinburgh School became notorious for its internal quarrels, and\r\nin these Simpson was, as a rule, to be found busy.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from these professional differences were the disputes\r\narising from attacks made upon Simpson by professional brethren\r\nand laymen, who accused him of wrong treatment or neglect of\r\npatients. His fame endowed him with almost superhuman powers in the\r\nminds of patients and their friends. When all other means had failed\r\nSimpson was hastened to as a last but sure resource; bitter the\r\ndisappointment, bitter was the grief, and also sometimes bitter the\r\nthings said of him when the anxious friends of a sufferer found\r\nthat even Simpson's powers of healing were limited. These attacks were\r\nsome of the \"arrows of malignancy,\" which naturally fell about the\r\nover-busy man. He thought it necessary to stop, pick up these arrows,\r\nand challenge the assailants; we may regret that he stooped so often\r\nto this action, but we feel that it sprang as much from the love of\r\ntruth and justice as from the dictates of a disposition inclined\r\ntowards quarrel.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to pass over the great controversy which raged in\r\nEdinburgh about 1850 on the merits of homoeopathy, in which Simpson,\r\nof course, took a leading part. About the beginning of the century the\r\npractice of medicine by the apothecaries, as the general practitioners\r\nwere then called, consisted in the most unscientific, nay, haphazard\r\nadministration of drugs in large quantities and combinations. It was\r\nan age of drugging doctors, and the custom had become so thoroughly\r\nestablished that it is doubtful whether any less completely opposite\r\nsystem than that introduced by Hahnemann would have convinced the\r\npublic that after all so many drugs were not required, nor such large\r\nquantities of them. Homoeopathic practice was founded on facts\r\nimproperly interpreted, and laid down for general use a procedure\r\nthat was applicable in only a limited number of cases. As Dr. Lauder\r\nBrunton has recently pointed out, it is in many instances only a\r\nmethod of faith-cure, and as such has its value. The success which its\r\npractitioners certainly obtained in many cases where the ordinary\r\nwholesale drugging of the day had proved futile, at once made men\r\npause ere allowing their bodies to be made receptacles for the\r\ncomplicated preparations of the physician. In Edinburgh at this time\r\nthe influence of homoeopathy had been felt. Alison, a physician of\r\ngreat renown, was to the end a pronounced polypharmacist, and was said\r\nscarcely ever to leave a patient without a new bottle or prescription.\r\nGraham, another university professor, was also a thorough-going old\r\nschool therapeutist. On the other hand, Syme treated all medicine\r\nexcept rhubarb and soda with disdain; and Henderson, the professor of\r\nPathology, and also a practising physician, after professing to\r\nconsider no medicine of very much value, became a pronounced sceptic,\r\nand finally horrified his colleagues by making trials of homoeopathy,\r\nand gradually becoming enamoured of it until he confessed himself a\r\nfull follower of Hahnemann's doctrines. Christison was leading the\r\nschool which urged that the action of medicines should be studied\r\nexperimentally if their administration was to be founded on scientific\r\ngrounds. The behaviour of Henderson, who so greatly owed his position\r\nas professor to Simpson, stirred the wrath of the latter. He examined\r\nand condemned the irrational system of Hahnemann, and threw himself\r\ninto an attitude of strong opposition. Syme and Christison ably\r\nseconded him in strong public action. Henderson was obliged to resign\r\nhis chair owing to \"loss of health.\" Homoeopathy was thoroughly\r\ncrushed in Edinburgh. The contest between the old system of drugging\r\nwith large complicated doses of powerful remedies, and the new one of\r\ngiving on principle infinitesimal doses of the same medicines, served\r\na good purpose. It gave an opportunity for establishing rational\r\ntherapeutics, a science which is making daily progress, and in the\r\npresence of which neither the old system nor homoeopathy can stand.\r\n\r\nAbout this same period mesmerism was again coming to the front, this\r\ntime cloaked as a science termed electro-biology. Simpson acknowledged\r\nthat there was a great deal in mesmerism demanding scientific\r\ninvestigation; but with his reasoning powers he could not realise the\r\nexistence of the mystically-termed higher phenomena of animal\r\nmagnetism, _e.g._, lucidity, transference of the senses, and, above\r\nall, clairvoyance. It happened that a professional mesmerist gave a\r\nperformance in Edinburgh; learning that the \"professor's\" daughter was\r\nstated to be able to read anything written on paper, or to divine any\r\nobject enclosed in a sealed box while under her father's mesmeric\r\npower, Simpson attended the performance. He took with him a\r\nspecially-prepared test--a sealed box with certain unknown contents;\r\nthis he presented at a suitable opportunity. Against their own wishes,\r\nbut on the insistence of the audience, the performers made an attempt\r\nby their methods to detect the nature of the contents of this\r\ntest-box. They pronounced it to be money; on opening it millet seed\r\nwas found, and a piece of paper, on which was written, \"humbug.\"\r\n\r\nAn accusation, couched in bitter terms, that Simpson was really a\r\nsupporter of mesmerism as it was then known, was published in one of\r\nthe leading professional journals in London. He indignantly repudiated\r\nthe suggestion and proposed to settle the matter finally by a simple\r\nexpedient. He offered to place five sealed boxes each containing a\r\nline from Shakspeare written by himself on paper, in the hands of the\r\neditor of the journal who had permitted the attack to appear in his\r\ncolumns. To any clairvoyant who read these lines according to the\r\nprofessed method, and to the satisfaction of a committee of eminent\r\nmedical men, he promised the sum of five hundred pounds. The offer,\r\nhowever, was not accepted.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant attainments of many of its teachers at this period not\r\nonly placed the Edinburgh school at the head of the British schools of\r\nmedicine, but also led to tempting offers being made to individual\r\nprofessors by rival schools anxious to secure their services.\r\n\r\nLondon was a much more lucrative field for practice than the Scots\r\nmetropolis, and several of the most eminent Edinburgh men had from\r\ntime to time yielded to the temptation to migrate southwards. Indeed,\r\nLondon as a medical school owes a great deal to the Scotsmen whom she\r\nimported. Liston had left for London in 1834, and Syme followed, for a\r\nbrief period, on Liston's death. In 1848 a strong effort was made to\r\nsecure Simpson as a lecturer on midwifery at St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital; without any hesitation he decided to remain in the city\r\nwhere he had fought his way to fame, and where he enjoyed popularity,\r\nand a practice sufficiently lucrative to satisfy the most ambitious\r\nman. Every patriotic Scot applauded the decision.\r\n\r\nDuring these years of fame and prosperity Simpson concerned himself in\r\nschemes for the improvement of the surroundings of the working\r\nclasses, and helped with speech and purse those who worked among the\r\npoor. He strongly supported the establishment of improved dwellings\r\nfor workpeople and gave much attention to the subject of Cottage\r\nHospitals. He did not neglect the poor amongst whom he had laboured in\r\nhis early days. He loved old Edinburgh, and the poor inhabitants of it\r\nwere near his heart. \"The Professor\" was known in many a \"wynd\" and\r\n\"stair,\" where his services were rendered willingly and without\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nARCHAEOLOGY--PRACTICE\r\n\r\n  His versatility--The Lycium of the Muses--The Catstane--Was the\r\n  Roman Army provided with medical officers?--Weems--His lack of\r\n  business method--Fees and no fees--Generosity often imposed\r\n  upon--His unusual method of conducting private practice--The\r\n  ten-pound note--Simpson and the hotel proprietors.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Simpson's versatility was remarkable. He turned from one\r\nsubject to another and displayed a mastery over each; it was not\r\nmerely the knowledge of principles which astonished but the intimate\r\nfamiliarity with details. He was able to discuss almost any subject in\r\nliterature, science, politics, or theology with its leading exponent\r\non equal terms. He had the power of patient listening as well as the\r\ngift of speech; more than that he had the ability to charm speech from\r\nothers, of making each man reveal his inmost thoughts, betray his most\r\ncherished theories, or narrate his most stirring experiences; the most\r\nreticent man would not realise until he had left Simpson's presence,\r\nthat in a brief interview, perhaps the first, he had told his greatest\r\nadventures, or laid bare his wildest aspirations before this student\r\nof mankind who was summarising his life and character as he spoke.\r\nSimpson built up his knowledge not so much from books as by the\r\nexercise of his highly developed faculty of observation aided by his\r\nmemory. He enjoyed the study of his fellowmen and extracted all that\r\nwas worth knowing from those with whom he came into contact. He never\r\nundertook work without a definite object in view, and rarely abandoned\r\nhis task before that object was accomplished. Quite small researches\r\nwould lead to considerable and unexpected labour. He preserved his\r\nscientific method, his desire to appeal only to the evidence of\r\nfacts--not to other men's fancies--through his archaeological work as\r\nwell as in more professional lines of study. He laboured long and\r\ncarefully over such an object as the study of old skulls dug up in\r\nantiquarian excursions; setting before himself the object of finding\r\nout by the condition and wear of the teeth what kind of food had been\r\nconsumed by the owners, probably primeval inhabitants of some\r\ndistrict. He impressed his methods upon those who worked for him or\r\nwith him. We find him writing to his nephew, who was about to visit\r\nEgypt, telling him when there to gather information as to the\r\nsuitability of the country for invalids, and directing him how to\r\nemploy his leisure in furthering this object. He was to study German\r\non the voyage thither, and to take with him as models Clarke's book on\r\nClimate and Mitchell's on Algiers, and any French or German books on\r\nthe subject he might hear of. He would require to collect (1) The\r\naverage daily temperature; (2) The hygrometric and barometric states\r\ndaily; (3) The temperature of the Nile; (4) The temperature of any\r\nmineral springs; (5) The general character of the geology; (6) The\r\ngeneral character of the botany of the country. He asked him to\r\ninquire specially as to the effect of the climate on consumption, and\r\npointed out that Pliny described Egypt seventeen centuries ago as the\r\nbest climate for phthisical patients. For amusement he was to take\r\nsome good general book on Egypt and Egyptian hieroglyphics. The\r\nserious study of a succession of inquirers was to be the young man's\r\nholiday amusement!\r\n\r\nSimpson's most notable contributions to archaeology were made when his\r\ntime was most occupied professionally. The researches on Leprosy were\r\nfirst enlarged and improved. In 1852, when in the British Museum, his\r\neye was attracted by a small leaden vase bearing a Greek inscription\r\nsignifying the _Lycium of the Muses_. By a painstaking inquiry he\r\nestablished that this lycium was the _Lykion indikon_ of Dioscorides,\r\ndrug used by ancient Greeks as an application to the eyes in various\r\nkinds of ophthalmia. It was obtained from India, and is still used for\r\nthese purposes in that country. He discovered that there were three\r\nother examples of this ancient receptable for the valued eye-medicine\r\nin modern museums.\r\n\r\nHe had correspondents in different parts of Scotland engaged in making\r\nresearches into antiquities, which he encouraged and directed. Among\r\nsuch were inquiries into the whereabouts of a church said to possess\r\nholy earth brought from Rome; and a hunt for ancient cupping-vessels.\r\nThe work on the Catstane of Kirkliston was elaborate, and a perfect\r\nexample of his method. Probably this stone, a massive unhewn block of\r\ngreenstone-trap, had been a familiar object to him in his youth, for\r\nit lay alone in a field close to the Linlithgow road. In his monograph\r\nhe endeavoured to show by close reasoning, with profuse references to\r\nforgotten authorities and ancient history, that the stone was the tomb\r\nof one Vetta, the grandfather of Hengist and Horsa. His argument ran\r\nas follows: The surname Vetta, which figured on the inscription carved\r\nupon the stone, was the name of the grandfather of Hengist and Horsa,\r\nas given by the oldest genealogists, who described him as the son of\r\nVicta. The inscription ran thus: VETTA F(ilius) VICTI. Vetta was an\r\nuncommon Saxon name, and no other Vetta, son of Victa, was known in\r\nhistory. Two generations before Hengist and Horsa arrived in England a\r\nSaxon host was leagued with the Picts, Scots, and Attacots in fighting\r\na Roman army, and these Saxons were probably commanded by an ancestor\r\nof Hengist and Horsa. The battlefield was situated between the two\r\nRoman walls, and consequently included the tract where the stone is\r\nnow placed. The palaeographic characters of the inscription indicated\r\nthat it was carved about the end of the fourth century. Latin (with a\r\nvery few exceptions in Greek) was the only language known to have been\r\nused at that time by Romanised Britons and foreign conquerors for the\r\npurpose of inscriptions. The occasional erection of monuments to Saxon\r\nleaders is proved by the fact mentioned by Bede that in his time, the\r\neighth century, there stood in Kent a monument commemorating the death\r\nof Horsa. In 1659 a writer had described this tomb of Horsa as having\r\nbeen destroyed by \"storms and tempests under the conduct of time.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Simpson was president of the Society of Antiquaries of\r\nScotland, and delivered an address on the past and present work of\r\narchaeology which greatly stimulated antiquarian study in his country.\r\nAmongst the honours which his antiquarian achievements brought upon\r\nhim was that of being appointed Professor of Antiquities to the Royal\r\nAcademy of Scotland; he was also elected a member of the Archaeological\r\nSocieties of Athens, Nassau, and Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nHe made researches into the subjects of lake dwellings, primeval\r\npottery, and burial urns. One of his most valuable writings was upon\r\nthe subject, \"Was the Roman Army provided with Medical Officers?\" He\r\nanswered the question in the affirmative after a laborious hunt\r\namongst votive and mortuary tablets; no Roman historians had left\r\nclear indications of the existence of any army medical department. He\r\nfound that several tablets were preserved bearing inscriptions\r\nreferring to army surgeons, which suggested that although they were\r\nall known as _medicus_ there were degrees of rank amongst them,\r\nnotably the _medicus legionis_ and the _medicus cohortis_. There is a\r\nwell-preserved tablet in the Newcastle Museum found in that\r\nneighbourhood, commemorating a surgeon of the first Tungrian cohort,\r\nand one in Dresden, referring to a _medicus duplicatorius_, a term\r\nwhich indicates that the surgeon had been fortunate enough by his\r\nattainments to merit, and, we hope, receive double fees for his\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nAll his antiquarian study was looked upon by Simpson himself as no\r\nmore than a relaxation. Fatigued by days and nights of anxious\r\nconsecutive professional work, he would suddenly dash off for a day\r\ninto some part of the country where he knew there was a likely \"find,\"\r\nleaving patients and students to the care of his assistants. Here he\r\nwould press into service and infect with his spirit all sorts of local\r\nworthies from the squire or laird down to the labourer, who woke up at\r\nhis stimulation to find that what had been of no concern to them and\r\ntheir fathers before them--perhaps objects of vituperation or\r\nsuperstitious dread--were objects of keen delight and interest, and\r\nactually valuable to this astonishing man. Once on a professional\r\nvisit to Fifeshire he quite casually discovered some remarkable though\r\nrough carvings in caves, representing various animals and curious\r\nemblems, and he was able to show that they presented features hitherto\r\nunnoticed. Fifeshire was famous for its underground dwellings, or, as\r\nthey are locally called, \"weems\"--a term which gave origin to the\r\ntitle of the Earldom of Wemyss. After such an excursion he would\r\nreturn to Queen Street full of boyish spirits, eager to narrate his\r\ndiscoveries to interested friends, and refreshed ready to resume the\r\ndaily round of work. Archaeology was his hobby--the hobby on which he\r\nrode away for refreshment and relief from the monotony of his life's\r\nwork; not only did the hobby constantly restore his flagging energies,\r\nbut as it is given to few men to do, he put new life into his hobby\r\nwhenever he bestrode it.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of his practice he was somewhat negligent. He was one\r\nof the old school in these matters; he trusted his head rather than\r\npaper, and his head had had such a careful self-imposed training since\r\nchildhood that it was a good servant. But where the brain has such\r\nenormous duties to perform, those which appear to it unimportant must\r\nof necessity be comparatively neglected.\r\n\r\nHad he been more careful of pounds, shillings, and pence, he would\r\nhave been more attentive to the details of practice. To Simpson,\r\nprovided he had sufficient money for all his wants--and his wants\r\nwere wide, for they included those of many others--pecuniary and\r\nbusiness matters were of secondary consideration. In his student days\r\nhe had lived carefully, accounting, as has been seen, for every\r\ntrivial expenditure to those to whom he was indebted. But now he was\r\nfree from the harassing necessity of exercising rigid economy, he cast\r\naside the drudgery of business methods and disdained commercial\r\nconsiderations. He certainly received some very large fees, but the\r\ncurious mixture of human beings who crowded his waiting-rooms were\r\ntreated all alike whether they paid princely fees or no fee at all;\r\nlots were drawn daily for precedence, and they entered his presence\r\naccording as they drew. His valet seems to have attained considerable\r\nskill in estimating the probable remunerative value of a roomful of\r\nwaiting patients, and would grumble at night if on emptying the\r\nprofessor's pockets, as was his duty, the result fell short of his\r\ncalculated anticipations. The man did not approve of the master's\r\nhabit of giving gratuitous service. There were many who were never\r\nasked for a fee, and many others whose proffered guineas were refused.\r\nSimpson would not ask for money from those to whom he thought it was a\r\nstruggle to pay him; the magnitude of his profit-yielding practice\r\nrendered this form of charity possible for him; from the really poor\r\nhe always refused remuneration. His house was filled with all sorts\r\nof presents from patients, grateful for benefit conferred, grateful\r\nfor generosity and consideration. He was also a free giver, and\r\nbesides supporting orthodox charities made many gifts of goodly sums\r\nto persons who appeared to him to be in want, or who succeeded in\r\nimpressing on him their need for help. He was imposed upon often\r\nenough; not seldom by pseudo-scientists full of some great discovery\r\nwhich a little more capital might enable them to complete. Once he\r\ncorresponded with an enthusiast of this description who confessed that\r\nhe had been breakfasting on a waistcoat, dining on a shirt, and\r\nsupping on a pair of tough old leather boots, with the object of\r\nfinding a solid substance, which combined with lead or tin would form\r\ngold--nothing more or less than the time-honoured philosopher's stone!\r\nTo such a man Simpson gave freely not only once.\r\n\r\nTo young students entering upon professional life with no other\r\ncapital than their newly acquired qualifications to practice, he was\r\never generous. The Scots Universities sent forth many such youths,\r\nsturdy and independent, and with feelings that would be easily wounded\r\nby any attempt to patronise. But his gentleness, and the sympathy born\r\nof his own early experiences and shining in his eyes, made help from\r\nhim something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nIt could never be urged against Simpson that he was avaricious. Just\r\nas when honours were showered upon him he accepted them with less\r\nthought of the personal honour than of the appreciation of his\r\nfriends and the public, and rejoiced that they were pleased; so he\r\nrejoiced in the acquisition of ample means chiefly because of the\r\npleasure he might derive therefrom by helping others.\r\n\r\nHis method of seeing patients was boldly haphazard; we learn with\r\nastonishment that he kept no list of his visits to be made, and\r\nstarted a day's round with only his prodigious memory to guide him as\r\nto where he should go. Such a method must have had the result that\r\nonly cases of interest or urgency were seen. No doubt the able staff\r\nof assistants attended to the others, but these comprised not only\r\nsufferers from trivial complaints but those afflicted with imaginary\r\nills who had come to see Simpson, not his assistant. Possibly they had\r\nalready suffered many things of many physicians and were none the\r\nbetter. Such persons blamed Simpson with some reason. In the case of\r\nneurotic persons only was his method not reprehensible; continued\r\nattendance might have undone the benefit of the one application, if we\r\nmay so term it, of his strong personality, which sometimes was all\r\nthat was required, so superstitious was the reverence for his powers.\r\nA precise system of registration of engagements and visits ought\r\ncertainly to have been adopted. We can sympathise with those who felt\r\naggrieved that they could not obtain more attention from the great\r\nman, but it must be remembered that by his own method he saw a great\r\nnumber of difficult and dangerous cases, and was able to originate out\r\nof his wide and unprecedented experience, modes of treatment which are\r\nto-day valued highly and successfully made use of by his professional\r\nsuccessors. He never wittingly left a fellow-creature's life in\r\ndanger, but would hasten at all hours to cases of real urgency.\r\n\r\nAs is usual where large numbers are striving after the same object\r\nsome were highly careless in their communications with him. Fees were\r\nsent to him with a request for a receipt, but no address was given.\r\nEngagements were asked for by persons who neglected to say at what\r\nhotel they were staying; and others worried him for letters on quite\r\ntrivial subjects. On one occasion, it is authentically related, a\r\nten-pound note was forwarded to him by a man who might more reasonably\r\nhave paid one hundred pounds. The note was somewhat carelessly not\r\nacknowledged, and the sender kept writing letters demanding an answer\r\nin increasing severity of tone. But he was left to rage in vain. A few\r\nnights later Simpson's sleep was disturbed by a rattling window; in\r\nthe dark he rose and groped for a piece of paper wherewith to stuff\r\nthe chink and stop the irritating noise. His only comment next morning\r\nwhen his wife, having removed the paper and discovered its nature came\r\nto him with it, was, \"Oh! it's _that_ ten pounds!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a great want of method in all his arrangements, and Dr. Duns\r\nconfesses to having had considerable difficulty in arranging\r\nSimpson's letters and papers, so carelessly were they kept.\r\n\r\nThe leading hotels in the city benefited by Simpson's reputation.\r\nPatients and pilgrims filled their rooms long before tourists began to\r\ncrowd Scotland as they do to-day. When Simpson was elected to the\r\nChair of Midwifery loud complaints were uttered by the hotel\r\nproprietors. His predecessor, Professor Hamilton, had been a man of\r\nsuch wide reputation that they derived much profit from the patients\r\nsent in from the surrounding country to be attended by him. How could\r\na young man like Simpson equal this? And yet when he died there was\r\nmore than one hotel proprietor who could attribute no small measure of\r\nhis own success to the patients and visitors who crowded not only from\r\nthe country districts of Scotland but from the most remote parts of\r\nthe British Empire, as well as from the great cities of Europe and\r\nAmerica, to gain help or speech from or perhaps only to see this same\r\nSimpson. And his fame had reached the high point it ever after\r\nmaintained when he was but a young man--before he was forty years of\r\nage. It was estimated that no less than eighty thousand pounds per\r\nannum was lost to the hotel, lodging, and boarding-house keepers of\r\nEdinburgh when he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPERSONAL--PROFESSORIAL--PROFESSIONAL\r\n\r\n  His genius--Fertility of resource--Personal influence--Work in\r\n  obstetrics and gynaecology and surgery--His lecturing and\r\n  teaching--The healing of wounds--Acupressure--Hospitalism--Proposal\r\n  to stamp out infectious diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor A. R. Simpson has said that his uncle Sir James Simpson's\r\ngenius showed itself in his power of seeing things, in his power of\r\nadapting means to ends, and in his power of making others see what he\r\nhad seen and do what he had done. We have seen these characteristics\r\ndisplayed in his work upon anaesthesia; it is literally true that he\r\nleft no stone unturned to gain his end and to make others look upon\r\nanaesthesia in the same light as he regarded it. He declared all the\r\nwhile that if he found the opposition to the administration of\r\nchloroform in midwifery practice too powerful to conquer alone, he\r\nwould finally overcome it by bringing about such a state of public\r\nopinion on the subject as would compel the profession to adopt his\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nWhether we regard Simpson as a physician or as a surgeon, as a\r\ngynaecologist or as an accoucheur, we find that his success was always\r\ndue to the same causes. He possessed no secret remedies such as an\r\nignorant and imaginative section of the public often credit to\r\nsuccessful medical men. He performed no operations with which other\r\nsurgeons were not equally familiar and equally capable of performing;\r\nindeed he frequently sent his surgical cases to operators in whose\r\nhands he considered they would be more skilfully treated than in his.\r\nIn obstetrics and gynaecology his skill arose not only from his\r\nunrivalled experience, but also from his power of rapid diagnosis, and\r\nhis promptness and boldness in treatment.\r\n\r\nHis readiness in resource was unfailing. On one occasion, it is\r\nrelated, during an operation the bottle of chloroform was knocked over\r\nand its contents were spilled upon the carpet before the surgeon had\r\ncompleted his work; whilst his colleagues were wondering what was to\r\nbe done or how a further supply of the anaesthetic could be obtained\r\nwith sufficient speed, Simpson was on his knees hacking out with his\r\nknife the portion of carpet on which the chloroform had just fallen;\r\nand by means of this extemporised inhaler the operation proceeded\r\nuninterrupted to the end.\r\n\r\nHe carried his distinguishing energy and thoroughness into every\r\nbranch of his work; even in extempore speeches made at meetings of\r\nprofessional societies, he placed facts before his listeners in so\r\nconvincing and lucid a manner out of the extensive variety of his\r\nknowledge, and aided by his great memory, that if he did not in\r\nreality gain the point he argued in favour of he generally appeared to\r\ndo so. On such occasions too his imperturbable temper was a valuable\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the genial professor availed himself fully of\r\nthe unbounded confidence placed in him by his patients. Those of us\r\nwho did not know him cannot appreciate what we have already said, that\r\nthe charm of his personality was one of the greatest factors of his\r\nsuccess in practice, and of his social success; there is the risk of\r\nthe appearance of exaggeration in any description of this personal\r\ninfluence. The sympathy of his heart, a real sympathy, not a thin\r\nprofessional veneer, was made manifest by deed as well as word. It\r\naroused in his patient, quite unconsciously to both, a feeling that\r\nthis man, above all other men, understood his complaint; that he, the\r\nsufferer was the chief, if not the only object of his thought and\r\ncare. It was said over and over again of him that his words and look\r\ndid more good than all his physic, so able a wielder was he of that\r\nhealing power which reaches the body through the mind. Those who knew\r\nhim not, but falling sick hastened to Edinburgh to be healed by him,\r\nwere oftentimes cured simply because they felt beforehand that he\r\nwould cure them. They followed unconsciously the ancient command of\r\nthe Talmud, where it says, \"Honour your physician before you have\r\nneed of him,\" and went to him full of respect and fired by faith. Wise\r\nmen have striven through all ages to take advantage of this influence\r\nof the mind over the body, and the necessity of possessing a healthy\r\nmind if the body is also to be healthy. A striking proof of the\r\nantiquity of the thought has been recently furnished in a fashion that\r\nwould have delighted Simpson. On a papyrus, dated A.D. 200, brought to\r\nlight by Egyptian explorers, it is written that Christ said: \"A\r\nprophet is not acceptable in his own country, neither doth a physician\r\nwork cures upon them that know him.\"\r\n\r\nThe advances which Simpson made in the science and practice of both\r\nmidwifery and gynaecology were due to the magnitude of his experience\r\nand the readiness of his genius to profit by experience. His one\r\nthought being the relief of suffering and the prolongation of life, he\r\napproached the bedside as a man with less high aspirations would fail\r\nto do. He considered only the patient's interest, and gave his genius\r\nfree play. He took midwifery and gynaecology by storm, and urged them\r\non to great developments; he believed in observing, helping, or\r\nimitating nature rather than acting, as his predecessors had done,\r\nupon preconceived ideas which oftener than not ran contrary to\r\nnature's commands. He avoided meddlesomeness, and stepped in only as\r\nthe ally of nature. He took numerous hints from bygone practitioners\r\nand writers, and developed them. To-day we are profiting by his\r\nteaching, and the instruments which he devised or perfected.\r\n\r\nTo mention all his suggestions and all his contributions to the arts\r\nwhich he specially practised would here be obviously impossible as\r\nwell as out of place; but to medical readers the mention of one\r\ninstrument associated with his name, and known as _the sound_, will\r\ngive a small indication of how much we are in his debt. The principle\r\nof this instrument had been known long before he took it in hand, but\r\nit was left for him to introduce it into practice, perfect it, and\r\npreach its value in diagnosis and treatment. So thorough was his work,\r\nso farseeing his science, that our knowledge of its utility has\r\nscarcely been added to since he first drew attention to it in 1843.\r\n\r\nTowards operative work his attitude was characteristically conscientious.\r\nWe are told that he habitually put the following question to himself when\r\ncontemplating a serious operation: \"Am I conscientiously entitled to\r\ninflict deliberately upon my fellow-creature with my own hands the\r\nimminent and immediate chance of death for the problematic and\r\nprospective chance of his future improved health and prolonged life?\"\r\nThe fact that he habitually thus questioned himself is an evidence of the\r\nstate of surgery at that time. Operations were undertaken only as a last\r\nresource to save life; the surgeon knew full well that he placed his\r\npatient in further peril merely by cutting through the skin, in a manner\r\nwhich has now happily become a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nHis work was so pre-eminently practical that he never stopped to\r\ncollect together his experiences into a scientific treatise. Although\r\nhe revivified midwifery, and was one of the original founders of\r\ngynaecology, he left to aftercomers the labour of studying what he had\r\ndone, and drawing the conclusions on which to strengthen the fabric of\r\nthe science. His pamphlets, papers, and reports are very numerous. It\r\nwould be wrong to say that modern thought has approved all that he\r\nwrote; but however much time and increased knowledge may have modified\r\nhis teaching, they have not detracted from the value of his\r\nresearches, discoveries, and suggestions, or from the stimulating\r\ninfluence of his work upon contemporary practice and thought.\r\n\r\nAs a lecturer and teacher Simpson succeeded as in the other branches\r\nof his work. His brilliant exposition of his subjects and his careful\r\npractical manner of teaching his young listeners doubled the fame\r\nwhich had begun with his predecessor, Professor Hamilton, and has ever\r\nsince belonged to the Edinburgh school of obstetricians. But here\r\nagain his personal attractiveness and power gained for him the greater\r\npart of his success. In the words of the _Lancet_, written when\r\nreviewing a posthumous collection of some of his writings, his\r\nlectures used to brighten the gloomy days of the Edinburgh winter; in\r\nperusing the publication under review, Edinburgh men would \"almost\r\nthink they saw the big head and face of the great obstetrician, as\r\nthey used to see him beaming with satisfaction or twinkling with\r\ngenial humour as he told a good story, or related a happy case,\r\nillustrative of his own bold and original practice.\" Both as a\r\nlecturer and as a bedside teacher he captured his students by the\r\ncharm of his diction, the wide range of his knowledge, and as\r\nProfessor Gusserow has pointed out in his masterly memoir, by his\r\npeculiar talent of having his knowledge at his fingers' ends, and that\r\noften in very remote details.\r\n\r\nYear by year he never failed to obtain the affection of his students;\r\nscarcely a man that had been taught by him but would proudly boast\r\nthat he was his friend as well as his teacher. He treated his large\r\nclass in a confiding spirit--not as the superior person delivering _ex\r\ncathedra_ utterances, but as the friend rejoicing in his function of\r\nadmitting those around him into the knowledge in which he seemed to\r\nrevel. He had a happy method of getting on good terms with his\r\naudience before proceeding to the serious business of the lecture.\r\nWhen his health began to fail he was sometimes unwillingly laid aside,\r\nand the lectures were delivered by a substitute. On one occasion he\r\nre-appeared pale, weak, and lame, after such an enforced holiday, and\r\nwas greeted enthusiastically by a crowded class. He told them that his\r\nservant had said to him that a rumour was abroad that he was in\r\nMorningside Asylum. He had asked what answer he had made, and heard\r\nthat he had replied that so far from being wrong in his mind his\r\nmaster was writing a book in bed. While he did not say that this\r\nanswer was strictly correct, he was happy to assure them, his pupils,\r\nthat he was quite right in his mind, although a friend had hinted that\r\nmorning that he was rather weak in his _understanding_!\r\n\r\nOld fellow-students meeting each other in after life as staid\r\npractitioners take pleasure in recalling the idiosyncrasies and\r\npeculiarities of their teachers; it is probable that no professor has\r\never been talked over with the appreciation which breathes through the\r\nreminiscences of Simpson conjured up by those whom he taught.\r\n\r\nSimpson left his mark in other departments besides those of the\r\nsubject of his professorial chair and of anaesthesia. About ten\r\nyears after the introduction of chloroform he turned his attention\r\nto the process of wound-healing--the repair of necessary wounds\r\ninflicted by surgeons in the course of their work--and although he\r\nwas promptly told to go back to his midwifery, he worked persistently\r\nat the subject. In those days the subject was the most burning one in\r\nsurgery and the methods employed to bring about successful results\r\nvaried in different schools. The object of all methods was the\r\nsame, viz., to obtain a healthy, clean, and sightly result after\r\nan operation; to leave the part which had been of necessity cut in a\r\ncondition as nearly as possible approaching that in which it had\r\nbeen found, without the incidence of any of the too frequent grave\r\ncomplications. Surgeons did not recognise at first the power of\r\nnature to effect for them what they strove after; they thought to\r\nattain their object by compelling the tissues to heal as they\r\ndesired by complicated applications, and many were the layers of\r\nointments and masses of dressings heaped on wounds for this\r\npurpose. For a long time all efforts were directed to the discovery\r\nof some specific substance, the application of which would give the\r\nnecessary impulse towards healing in the desired manner. Before\r\nSimpson's day it had been generally recognised that the cause--but\r\nits nature was quite undreamt of--of the trouble lay in the air\r\nsurrounding the wound, and more dressings were piled on to keep\r\nout the air. But at the same time bleeding was arrested by tying the\r\ncut arteries with ligatures--chiefly silken--and these were left\r\nwith long ends hanging out of the wound to work their way out by a\r\nprocess of ulceration, or irritation of the tissues until liberty was\r\nobtained. This process was practically incompatible with the ideal\r\nform of healing, known as healing by _first intention_, _i.e._,\r\nunion without appreciable loss of substance or the formation of\r\n_pus_ or matter. So-called \"surgical fever,\" secondary haemorrhage,\r\nand blood-poisoning were the frequent fatal results of operation\r\nwounds treated in this manner. Simpson and others thought to prevent\r\nthese alarming diseases by devising other means of closing the\r\narteries; thinking that if some method or material were used,\r\nwhich nature resented less, the wound would more readily close by\r\nfirst intention. In 1858 Simpson stated that he had for some time\r\npast been experimenting with substitutes for the ordinary silk and\r\nthread ligatures, and in the course of his experiments had made use\r\nof iron, silver, and platinum wires. In his usual way he hunted up\r\nold authorities, and found a record of both silver and gold threads\r\nhaving been experimentally used by bygone practitioners. He seems to\r\nhave been pleased with his results, stating that he found the\r\ntissues much more tolerant of these metallic ligatures than they were\r\nof the ordinary organic ones; that only \"adhesive inflammation,\" not\r\nulcerative suppurative inflammation, was excited. This success,\r\nhowever, was probably due to the superior cleanliness of the metal,\r\nbut this he did not recognise; had he done so he might have been led\r\nto strive after surgical cleanliness, and have partly anticipated the\r\ngreat work done subsequently by others. He went off, however, on a\r\ndifferent line, and searched for some readier method of using\r\nmetallic means of closing the blood vessels, being stimulated by\r\nthe desire to abolish ligatures altogether. Thus he was led, after\r\nten years' careful research, to the introduction of a method entirely\r\noriginal--that of _Acupressure_. This consisted in the introduction\r\nof a fine needle through the tissues across the course of the\r\nartery, so that while the needle pressed upon one side of the artery\r\nthe resisting tissues of the body exerted counter-pressure on the\r\nopposite side. He claimed for his method the merits of simplicity,\r\nelegance, and cleanliness, and urged that not only did the tissues\r\ntolerate the needle as they did not tolerate silk or hemp, but that\r\nunlike the ligature the needle could be withdrawn as soon as\r\nnature had closed the blood vessel by the process of coagulation of\r\nthe blood within it set up by the pressure; thus the prolonged\r\nirritating presence of a body within the wound which delayed\r\nhealing until it had ulcerated its way out was rendered unnecessary,\r\nand a better and more rapid result was attained. He verified his\r\ntheoretical considerations by experiments on animals and in one or\r\ntwo operations on the human subject, and in 1859 read a communication\r\non the subject to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe paper was written under great pressure of work, indeed he stated\r\nthat at that time he was hardly ever able to write except when himself\r\n\"confined\"; it was hastily prepared to take the place of that of\r\nanother Fellow which had failed to be forthcoming a few days before\r\nthe appointed meeting. It was composed at a country house where he had\r\nto sleep for two or three nights watching a case of diphtheria. It was\r\nheaded as usual by a Shakspearian quotation, this time briefly in\r\nJustice Shallow's words, thus:--\"Tut, a pin!\" On the evening of its\r\ndelivery an abstract of the paper was forwarded to the leading\r\nsurgeons in England, Europe, and America, and diverse were the\r\nopinions expressed.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland the new method met with the greatest favour and the\r\nstrongest opposition at one and the same time. Throughout Europe and\r\nAmerica it was everywhere received with applause and support.\r\nExcellent results were obtained when the method was properly applied,\r\nbut technical considerations, particularly the difficulty of using it\r\nupon blood vessels far removed from the surface, rendered it\r\nunsuitable for universal application.\r\n\r\nProfessor Syme met the innovation with vehement opposition;\r\npossibly he resented this intrusion of the gynaecologist into the\r\nregions of general surgery. He took into his class-room one pamphlet\r\non the subject by Simpson, which had especially aroused his wrath; he\r\nstormed at the author before his students for \"his vulgar insolence,\"\r\nand then, in a dramatic scene, expressed the violence of his contempt\r\nby savagely tearing the pamphlet into pieces and casting it away.\r\nIn a subsequent controversy between these two old opponents, who\r\nhad been temporarily united by Simpson's conduct in consulting Syme\r\nprofessionally, by their joint action against homoeopathy, and by\r\nSimpson's defence of Syme when publicly attacked by an English\r\nsurgeon, the feud was renewed.\r\n\r\nSimpson persisted for years in collecting reports of operations in\r\nwhich acupressure was employed, and published them from time to time\r\nin the _British Medical Journal_ and elsewhere. In 1864 his work\r\non the subject took the form of a volume containing 580 quarto pages.\r\nHis friends endeavoured to rank acupressure with chloroform as one\r\nof the blessings to humanity made manifest by him. He himself\r\nrecognised that he had failed to gain for acupressure a place in\r\npractice such as he had gained for chloroform, but he looked forward\r\nto a time, perhaps a quarter of a century distant, when his method\r\nwould be beginning to be thought about. In this he was mistaken for,\r\non the contrary, acupressure was beginning to be forgotten long before\r\ntwenty-five years had elapsed. Another worker on more strictly\r\nscientific lines had by that time made healing by first intention,\r\nwithout complications, the rule instead of the exception, and\r\nconferred a benefit on humanity as great if not greater than that of\r\nanaesthesia. In 1867, while Simpson was still alive, Mr. (now Lord)\r\nLister (then a hospital surgeon in Glasgow, and subsequently Syme's\r\nsuccessor in Edinburgh) enunciated the new principle of \"antiseptic\r\nsurgery,\" which recognised the living infective micro-organisms of\r\nthe air as the cause of the trouble in wounds. He directed that as\r\nthese invisible organisms (known only by means of the microscope)\r\nwere present everywhere in the air, found their way into all sorts of\r\nwounds, and set up the decomposition which led to disastrous\r\nresults, they were to be destroyed or excluded from wounds; and he\r\nsuggested effective means of accomplishing this end. He further\r\nabolished the long ligatures which irritated by their presence, and\r\nby the organisms they conveyed into the wound when imperfectly\r\ncleansed as they usually were; and substituted non-irritating\r\nligatures which nature herself was able to remove by the process of\r\nabsorption. The recognition of this antiseptic principle effected a\r\nmuch needed revolution in surgery, and in this revolution acupressure\r\nwas practically annihilated. Simpson did not live long enough to\r\nsee the complete establishment of the Listerian principle; at\r\nfirst he vigorously opposed what he considered to be an attempt to\r\nretain the old-fashioned ligatures in preference to his new\r\nacupressure; but with his penetrative eye he must have foreseen\r\nthat should the new practice prevail and short absorbable ligatures\r\nbe made possible, acupressure would be completely superseded.\r\n\r\nIn the estimation of the writer of the obituary notice of Professor\r\nSimpson in the _British Medical Journal_, the greatest of all his\r\nworks was that undertaken in the subject of Hospitalism. As early as\r\n1847 he had been horrified to read in a report of the work done in the\r\nEdinburgh Infirmary, that out of eighteen cases of primary amputation\r\nperformed during a period of four years only two survived. He faced\r\nthis fact with the courage of the reformer, and sought far and near\r\nfor other facts to support the theory which he gradually evolved, that\r\nthis melancholy failure of surgeons to save their patients' lives was\r\ndue not so much to the operation or the operator as to the\r\nenvironment of the patient. In later years he himself often shrank, on\r\naccount of unfortunate experiences, from performing capital operations\r\nwhich he had formerly unhesitatingly undertaken. The unhealthiness of\r\nhospitals had long been recognised; and was especially observed at\r\ntimes when they were overcrowded, as happened during war time. When\r\nthe public had thoroughly grasped the utility of anaesthetics, and\r\nrecognised that operations could be performed painlessly, there were\r\nfewer refusals to submit to the knife; there was a rush to the\r\nhospitals, and the surgical wards throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe land became crowded with men and women actually longing for\r\noperation. Amongst these all the dreaded sequelae of surgical\r\ninterference, which no power seemed able to check, ravaged with\r\nalarming severity.\r\n\r\nIt is to Simpson's credit that he perceived how the introduction of\r\nanaesthesia had taxed the hospitals and bewildered the operators, who\r\nsought diligently but unsuccessfully in every direction for some means\r\nof reducing hospital mortality. He was one of the first to set to work\r\nwith method to investigate this question of Hospitalism.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of his career, when the old Edinburgh Infirmary\r\nstood condemned, and various proposals for rebuilding it on a new site\r\nand improved plan were under discussion, that his voice was most\r\nloudly heard. For many years he had thought and taught that the great\r\nmortality after operations in hospitals was due to the impure state of\r\nthe air therein, derived from the congregation of a large number of\r\nsick persons under one roof. He picturesquely stated that the man laid\r\non a hospital operating table was exposed to more chances of death\r\nthan the English soldier was on the field of Waterloo. His original\r\nsuggestion was that hospitals might be changed from being crowded\r\npalaces, with a layer of sick on each floor, into villages or\r\ncottages, with one, or at most two, patients in each room; the\r\nbuilding to be of iron, so that it could be periodically taken down\r\nand reconstructed, and presumably thoroughly renovated. This drastic\r\nproposal brings nowadays a smile to the lips, for we see now how he\r\nwas groping in the dark; but the magnitude of it is but the shadow of\r\nthe evil it was designed to cure. The change was so great as to be\r\nimpracticable in the eyes of most men; he, on the other hand,\r\ncontended that it was to be of incalculable benefit to humanity, and,\r\ntherefore, no difficulty, however great, should be allowed to stand in\r\nthe way. He did not understand that the evils arose not from the air\r\nitself but from what was in the air, known to us now as the\r\nmicro-organisms. His remedy was a proposal to run away from the evils\r\nwithout receiving any guarantee that they could not and would not\r\nsuccessfully pursue. Had Lister not arisen, Simpson's proposals might\r\nhave possibly prevailed, for he laboured with all his persistent\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nThe general belief of the profession--but it was no more than a\r\nbelief--was that operations performed in country practice were not so\r\nfrightfully fatal as those performed in town hospitals. This was\r\nSimpson's opinion, and he determined to test its truth by appeal to\r\nfacts. He drew up a circular with a schedule for the insertion of\r\nresults in a statistical form, and sent it far and wide amongst\r\ncountry practitioners. He awaited the result with anxious expectation;\r\nthe circular asked for a plain statement of facts only, and for all he\r\nknew the facts might be against his theory; but they were not. From\r\nall over England and Scotland, particularly from mining districts,\r\nwhere severe operations after accidents were common, the filled-up\r\nschedules flowed in, to the number of 374. These were collected,\r\ncarefully classified and summarised.

He did not attribute sufficient importance to the fact urged\r\nby many of his correspondents, who supported his general contentions\r\nalmost to a man out of their own experience, that where fresh air,\r\nventilation, and cleanliness prevailed, the results were always the\r\nmost satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to take hospital statistics of similar operations,\r\nand the general result appears in the table on page 183.\r\n\r\nThis testimony to the truth of Simpson's opinion was more pronounced\r\nthan even he himself had anticipated. \"Shall this pitiless and\r\ndeliberate sacrifice of human life to conditions which are more or\r\nless preventable be continued, or arrested? Do not these terrible\r\nfigures plead eloquently and clamantly for a revision and reform of\r\nour existing hospital system?\" This was his cry until at length\r\nbreath failed him. The opposition was not strong, but the support\r\nwas weak. Although there was much criticism, his conclusions were\r\nscarcely called in question at all; trifling holes were picked in\r\nhis statistics, but his contentions were universally acknowledged\r\nto be correct; a few reformers only, persuaded as he was of the\r\nevils of hospitalism and working at the subject, lent him their\r\nadvocacy. But he alone stood unperturbed at the extent of the evils\r\nand the magnitude of the change which he proposed in order to\r\nuproot them; death laid him low as he stood, but not before he had\r\nmodified his proposals by suggesting that existing hospitals might be\r\nreconstructed, and new hospitals built on the now almost universally\r\nadopted pavilion system on which the new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was\r\none of the first to be built.\r\n\r\n  Column Headings--\r\n  C: Cases.\r\n  D: Deaths.\r\n   _______________________________________________________________________\r\n  |                       |                                               |\r\n  |      HOSPITAL.        |                  FOR INJURY.                  |\r\n  |_______________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n  |                       |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |                       |  Thigh.   |    Leg.   |    Arm.   |  Forearm. |\r\n  |                       |___________|___________|___________|___________|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |                       | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Edinburgh Infirmary   | 134 |  48 |  28 |   9 |   7 |   3 |  19 |   7 |\r\n  | Glasgow   \"           | 100 |  60 |  93 |  50 | 101 |  38 |  66 |   9 |\r\n  | Nine London Hospitals | 320 | 123 | 173 |  53 |  48 |  13 |  37 |   7 |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Total                 | 631 | 239 | 283 |  89 |  78 |  22 |  75 |  15 |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |           |           |           |           |\r\n  | Mortality per cent.   |   64.4    |   54.8    |   40.1    |   14.8    |\r\n  |_______________________|___________|___________|___________|___________|\r\n\r\n   _______________________________________________________________________\r\n  |                       |                                               |\r\n  |      HOSPITAL.        |                 FOR DISEASE.                  |\r\n  |_______________________|_______________________________________________|\r\n  |                       |           |           |           |           |\r\n  |                       |  Thigh.   |    Leg.   |    Arm.   |  Forearm. |\r\n  |                       |___________|___________|___________|___________|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  |                       | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] | [C] | [D] |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Edinburgh Infirmary   |  65 |  48 |  58 |  29 |  21 |  12 |  39 |   5 |\r\n  | Glasgow   \"           | 177 |  68 |  82 |  27 |  23 |   6 |  19 |   1 |\r\n  | Nine London Hospitals | 139 |  88 | 179 | 102 |  97 |  33 |  64 |  11 |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\r\n  | Total                 | 304 | 196 | 330 | 181 | 219 |  88 |  169|  25 |\r\n  |_______________________|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|_____|\r\n  |                       |           |           |           |           |\r\n  | Mortality per cent.   |   37.8    |   31.4    |    28.2   |     2.0   |\r\n  |_______________________|___________|___________|___________|___________|\r\n\r\n  The total number of cases  2,089 } mortality 41 per cent.\r\n  The total number of deaths   855 }\r\n  Placed side by side the Town (hospital only) and Country (private\r\n        practice only) figures compared as follows:--\r\n    _Hospital_ cases 2,089; deaths 855; mortality 41 per cent. or 1 in 2.4\r\n    _Country_    \"   2,098;   \"    226;    \"      10.8     \"      1 in 9.2\r\n\r\nThe steady advance of aseptic surgery has slowly but surely brought\r\nabout the results which Simpson strove to attain by a radical measure.\r\nThe enemy which had baffled surgeons for centuries was revealed by\r\nLister. He sent surgeons smiling into the operating-room practically\r\ncertain of success instead of dreading the terrible onslaught upon\r\ntheir own handiwork of the formerly unseen and unknown destroyer. The\r\ndeath rate of operations is being daily brought nearer and nearer to\r\nvanishing point. In his review of the progress of wound treatment\r\nduring the Victorian Era published in the Diamond Jubilee number of\r\n_The Practitioner_, Mr. Watson Cheyne says the mortality of major\r\noperations does not now exceed in hospitals more than three or four\r\nper cent., and this is made up practically entirely by cases admitted\r\nalmost moribund and operated on _in extremis_ with faint hope of\r\nsurvival. The field of surgery, too, has been vastly enlarged, and the\r\nterm \"major operation\" includes not merely operations of necessity,\r\nundertaken through ages past as the only possible means of saving\r\nlife, but also operations which have become possible only in recent\r\nyears--some of them performed merely to make the patient \"more\r\ncomfortable,\" or even only \"more beautiful.\" And this glorious result\r\nis due, as Mr. Cheyne truly says, to the immortal genius of Lister.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Simpson propounded in the _Medical Times and Gazette_ a\r\nproposal for stamping out smallpox and other infectious diseases such\r\nas scarlet fever and measles. In spite of vaccination, which, however,\r\nwas imperfectly carried out, smallpox alone carried off five thousand\r\nlives annually in Great Britain. A serious outbreak of rinderpest in\r\nthe British Islands amongst cattle had recently been arrested and\r\nexterminated by the slaughter of all affected animals. The disease\r\nspread as smallpox did by contagion, and Simpson fell to wondering why\r\nsmallpox could not also be exterminated. His paper was a noteworthy\r\ncontribution to the then infant science of Public Health, and his\r\nproposal, which was, however, universally regarded as impracticable,\r\nsprang from his courageous enthusiasm as did that concerning\r\nhospitals. He suggested that the place of the pole-axe in the\r\nextermination of rinderpest might in the arrest of smallpox be taken\r\nby complete isolation, and he laid down simple but rigid rules for its\r\nenforcement. An attempt was made to utilise these a few years after\r\nwhen an epidemic of fatal violence broke out in Edinburgh. He was in\r\nno way an anti-vaccinationist, but his isolation measures were too\r\nstrong for the people in those days. We are not surprised that he\r\nboldly proposed this measure, for he related glaring instances of\r\nneglect of the simplest precautions. Beggars held up infants with\r\nfaces encrusted with active smallpox into the very faces of passers-by\r\nin the streets of Edinburgh; and on one occasion a woman was found in\r\nGlasgow serving out sweetmeats to the children of a school with her\r\nhands and face covered by the disease. He cried aloud for legislation\r\nto prevent such gross abuses, which he did not hesitate to stigmatise\r\nas little short of criminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFURTHER REFORMS--HONOURS\r\n\r\n  Professional and University Reform--Medical women--Honours--The\r\n  Imperial Academy of Medicine of France--Baronetcy--Domestic\r\n  bereavement--The University Principalship--Freedom of the City of\r\n  Edinburgh--Bigelow of Boston--Views on education--Graduation\r\n  addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Simpson took a warm interest in medical politics, and made\r\nhimself heard as a member of the Senatus of the University. That body\r\nwas not renowned for any spirit of harmony prevailing in its midst; it\r\nincluded the medical professors many of whom were in professional\r\nopposition to each other and were actuated by conflicting interests.\r\nThe rivalry prevailing amongst the leaders of the profession in the\r\nScots capital was amusingly shown in one of Sir James's letters, where\r\nhe related how Professor Miller had just given a capital address to\r\nthe young graduates and recommended them to marry chiefly because Mr.\r\nSyme had advised the reverse two years before. \"At least,\" he said,\r\n\"so Mr. Syme whispered to me, and so, indeed, did Miller himself\r\nstate to Dr. Laycock!\"\r\n\r\nOn the principles of Medical Reform and University Reform the\r\nprofessors were, however, practically unanimous, but their interests\r\ncame into conflict with those of the extra-academical school. The\r\ntwo opposing bodies worked hard to gain their own ends when a\r\nParliamentary Committee was appointed in 1852 to inquire into\r\nmedical reform. The modern Athens became once more disturbed by\r\nwordy warfare. The general ends aimed at by the reformers were the\r\nobtaining of a proper standing for qualified practitioners; some\r\nsatisfactory means of enabling the public to distinguish between\r\nregular and irregular, quack, practitioners; and to define the amount\r\nof general and professional knowledge necessary for degrees and\r\nqualifications. It was also desired to remove the absurd anomaly\r\nwhereby, although Scots medical education was then ahead of English,\r\nScots graduates had no legal standing in England. The Medical Act\r\nwhich was passed in 1858 carried out many of the best suggestions\r\nmade before the Committee, and effected desirable improvements both\r\nin the status of practitioners and in medical education; but it was\r\ninadequate, as time has shown, and the question of reform still\r\nburns. Simpson took an active interest in the proceedings before the\r\nCommittee, and made several dashes up to London to further the\r\nprojects which he had at heart. The annual meeting of the British\r\nMedical Association was held in Edinburgh in July, 1858, at the\r\nmoment when the fate of the Bill hung in the balance. As the journal\r\nof the Association said at the time the fruit of a quarter of a\r\ncentury's growth was plucked in the midst of the rejoicings. Sir\r\nRobert Christison publicly stated that owing to Simpson's energetic\r\nefforts certain far-reaching and objectionable clauses, which had\r\nbeen allowed to creep into the Bill, were expunged at the last\r\nmoment. Simpson went up to London by the night train, employed the\r\nfollowing day in effecting his purpose, and returned the next night;\r\nthis was when the journey took nearly twice as many hours as now.\r\n\r\nThe Universities (Scotland) Act was also passed in 1858; by it the\r\ncomplete control of the University, and with it the patronage of many\r\nof the Chairs, was lost to its original founders, the Town Council,\r\nwho had so carefully and successfully guided it through nearly three\r\ncenturies. The Council did not part from their charge without a\r\nstruggle; in urging their cause they proudly pointed to the fact that\r\nthey had appointed Simpson to the Chair of Midwifery against the\r\nopposition of the medical faculty. To have elected him, they thought,\r\nunder such circumstances displayed their discernment, vindicated their\r\nexistence, and pleaded for the perpetuation of their elective office.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the admission of women to the study of medicine\r\ncame up in Edinburgh and divided the ancient city once more into two\r\nhostile camps, Simpson's sympathies appear to have gone with the sex\r\nto which he was already a benefactor. He recognised that there was a\r\nplace, if a small one, within the ranks of the profession for women;\r\nand when the question came to the vote he cast his in their favour.\r\nThe proposal, however, was rejected, and has only quite recently\r\nbecome law in the University.\r\n\r\nNumerous honours were heaped upon him during the last five-and-twenty\r\nyears of his life. In 1847 he filled the office of President of the\r\nEdinburgh College of Physicians, and in 1852 held the corresponding\r\npost in the Medico-Chirurgical Society. In the following year the\r\nImperial Academy of Medicine of France--a body which lacks an analogue\r\nin this country--conferred upon him the title of Foreign Associate.\r\nThis was a jealously guarded honour awarded only to the most highly\r\ndistinguished men of the day, and it was conferred upon Simpson in an\r\naltogether unprecedented manner which doubled its value. According to\r\ncustom a commission of members prepared a list of renowned men whom\r\nthey advised the Academy to elect; in the list no British name\r\nappeared although Owen, Faraday, and Bright were entered as\r\n\"reserves.\" On the day of election the members accepted all the\r\ncandidates named in the original list until the last was reached. When\r\nthe president asked for the vote for this individual a sensational\r\nand truly Gallic scene was enacted. Almost to a man the members rose,\r\nand loud and long proclaimed Simpson's name. Excited speeches were\r\nmade, and amidst great enthusiasm he was elected to the one remaining\r\nvacancy by an overwhelming majority. It had remained for Simpson to\r\nprove, as the President courteously pointed out at the time, that\r\nthere existed a greater honour than that of being elected by the\r\nAcademy--viz., that of being chosen in _spite_ of the will of the\r\nAcademy itself.\r\n\r\nThis was by no means the only honour awarded to him by France. In 1856\r\nthe French Academy of Sciences voted him the Monthyon Prize of two\r\nthousand francs for \"the most important benefits done to humanity.\"\r\nOther foreign societies added their compliments, and he was elected\r\nForeign Associate of the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, of the\r\nParisian Surgical and Biological Societies, and of the Medical\r\nSocieties of Norway, Stockholm, Copenhagen, New York, Massachusetts,\r\nLeipsic, and other places.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 his own country made an acknowledgment of his eminent\r\nattainments when the Queen offered him a baronetcy on the advice of\r\nLord John Russell. Twice before he had refused a title, but this\r\ntime he wrote to his brother that he feared he _must_ accept\r\nalthough it appeared so absurd to take a title. This honour was the\r\nfirst of its kind ever conferred upon a doctor, or even upon a\r\nprofessor, in Scotland. It was entirely unsought, and scarcely\r\nwelcomed by its recipient for its own sake; he regarded it not merely\r\nas a personal honour but also as a tardy recognition of the services\r\nof the Edinburgh school in the cause of medicine. He enjoyed the\r\ncongratulations which showered upon him, and felt glad when the\r\ncitizens flocked to Queen Street to express their feelings, much to\r\nLady Simpson's delight. The medical papers unanimously approved of\r\nthe honour, the _Lancet_ remarking that apart from his connection with\r\nchloroform, Simpson was distinguished as an obstetric practitioner, as\r\na physiologist, as an operator, and as a pathologist of great\r\nresearch and originality.\r\n\r\nDomestic bereavement quenched the rejoicings over the baronetcy, and\r\ncondolences displaced congratulations. He fell ill for a time himself,\r\nand in a condition of unusual mental depression spoke of the baronetcy\r\nas appearing even more of a bauble in sickness than in health. In less\r\nthan a fortnight after the offer of the title his eldest son David\r\ndied after a short illness. He had been educated for the medical\r\nprofession, and was a youth of considerable promise and of an earnest\r\ntemperament; his death fell as a severe blow, and Simpson even\r\ncontemplated abandoning the baronetcy which had not yet been formally\r\nconferred. The words of his friends, however, and the thought that his\r\ndead son had particularly insisted on its acceptance, persuaded him.\r\n\r\nA coat of arms had to be drafted for the new Baronet, and this was a\r\npleasant interest for one of his tastes. The family history was\r\nsearchingly entered into, and the arms of his father's family were\r\ndifferenced on the most correct lines with those of the Jervays from\r\nwhom his mother had sprung. In the matter of a crest he was able to be\r\nboldly original, and adopted the rod of AEsculapius over the motto\r\n_Victo dolore_, and thus handed down to his family the memory of his\r\ngreat victory over pain. In June of the same year, 1866, the\r\nUniversity of Oxford conferred upon him one of the few honours which\r\nreached him from England in awarding him the honorary degree of Doctor\r\nof Civil Law. The University of Dublin made him an honorary Doctor of\r\nMedicine, and he was created an honorary Fellow of the King's and\r\nQueen's College of Physicians of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBy the death of the veteran Sir David Brewster, in February, 1868, the\r\noffice of Principal of Edinburgh University fell vacant. This post is\r\na survival from the earliest days. The College out of which the\r\nUniversity grew was established in 1583 by the Town Council under a\r\ncharter granted by James VI. Only one regent or tutor was necessary at\r\nfirst to teach the \"bairns,\" as the students were termed in the\r\ncontract entered into between Rollock, the first regent, and the city\r\nfathers. Rollock was promised that as the college increased \"in policy\r\nand learning\" he should be advanced to the highest post created. By\r\nhis own efforts the number of students increased so greatly that\r\nwithin the first few years several other regents were appointed, and\r\nthe Council, remembering their promise, dignified him with the title\r\nof Principal or First Master in 1586. This office was held during the\r\nsucceeding two centuries by a series of more or less worthy men,\r\nprominent among whom were Leighton, afterwards Archbishop of Glasgow,\r\nand William Carstares, better known as a statesman and for his\r\nconnection with the Rye House Plot in 1684. During Carstares's tenure\r\nthe tutors were turned into professors, and the college became more\r\nstrictly speaking a university, although from the first it had assumed\r\nwithout any right by charter the function of degree-granting. Although\r\nthe utility of the post quite vanished when the college became a\r\nuniversity, and the principal had no place in the constitution of a\r\nuniversity, nevertheless the principalship was not abolished. The\r\nUniversities Act of 1858 recognised the office, but only as that of an\r\nornamental head, acting as president of the assembly of professors\r\nconstituting the Senatus Academicus. The salary is a thousand pounds a\r\nyear with an official residence, not within the precincts or the\r\nUniversity. The former head master of the college, known by and\r\nknowing every student, became a sinecurist of whose existence it is no\r\nexaggeration to say many of the students are, through no fault of\r\ntheir own, unaware. Brewster had been a distinguished occupant of the\r\npost--distinguished not as a principal, for he received the\r\nappointment only at the age of seventy-eight, but as a scientist. To\r\nthe public he was best known as the author of the \"Life of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton,\" and as the inventor of the kaleidoscope. It is said that\r\nBrewster never spoke as much as five lines at the meetings of the\r\nSenatus Academicus without having previously written them down; and it\r\nis probable that this lack of spontaneous utterance from the Chairman\r\ngave the tone to the assembly. The rival professors doubtless nursed\r\ntheir animosities for some less dignified meeting-place, differing\r\nthere only on the most correct academic lines.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Simpson at first refused to be a candidate\r\nfor the vacant post. He would undoubtedly have made an unrivalled\r\nfigure-head for his _Alma Mater_; he was the leading figure in\r\nScotland already and \"did the hospitalities\" of Edinburgh to\r\ndistinguished visitors of all classes. But he would probably have been\r\nobliged to resign his professorship and have thus been cut off from\r\nhis sphere of greatest usefulness; and although he would have grasped\r\nwith ease the details of university affairs it is open to question\r\nwhether he would have suitably filled the post of president over men\r\nto many of whom he was in professional opposition. The most that the\r\nsuggestion that he should be a candidate conveyed was a well-meant\r\ncompliment, but it would have been a greater compliment on his part if\r\nhe had really ended his life as the ornamental head of the University\r\nhe had already done so much to adorn. He would certainly have turned\r\nhis position to good account, and perhaps might have earned the\r\ngratitude of all succeeding students by improving their position in\r\nthe University and bettering their relationship with their teachers--a\r\nmuch needed reform at that time. But he was a man for more active\r\noccupation, and it was more fitting that he should persevere to the\r\nend in the work of his life. Simpson expressed his opinion that the\r\nmost suitable man for the post was the one already named by Brewster\r\nand desired by a majority of the Senatus; but that man, Professor\r\nChristison, then over seventy years of age, generously said that Sir\r\nAlexander Grant, an active candidate, would better fill the post. A\r\nstrong section of Edinburgh folks persisted in pushing Simpson, and in\r\ndeference to their wishes he consented to enter the lists. It cannot\r\nbe said that he displayed any of the eager energy which had marked his\r\ncandidature for the midwifery chair; but his friends made up for his\r\ncomparative apathy. They were met by a strong opposition, not\r\ninstigated by his rivals for the post, but offered by insignificant\r\npersons who cherished ill-will against him and spread untrue\r\nstatements with the object of damaging his character. Greatly owing to\r\nthe reports spread in this manner he was not elected. Sir Alexander\r\nGrant became the new Principal. The fact that he could not gain the\r\npost was communicated to him in a letter which reached him one morning\r\nbefore prayers. He conducted the worship as usual after reading the\r\nletter, and when the family had afterwards all assembled at the\r\nbreakfast table he intimated the fact to them and dismissed the\r\nsubject from his mind with the quiet remark, \"I have lost the\r\nPrincipalship.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting episode pertaining to this period was narrated by the\r\nFree Church minister of Newhaven. \"The election,\" he wrote to Dr.\r\nDuns, \"took place on a Monday, and it was on the Sabbath preceding,\r\nbetween sermons, that one of my people, a fisherman, called on me\r\nstating that his wife was apparently dying, but that she and all her\r\nfriends were longing most intensely for a consultation with Sir James.\r\nI did not know well what to do, for I knew that his mind was likely to\r\nbe very much harassed, and I shrank from adding to his troubles. But\r\nin the urgency of the case I wrote him a note simply stating that one\r\nof the best women in the town was at the point of death and longed for\r\nhis help, leaving the matter without another word to himself. The\r\nresult was that he came down immediately, spent three hours beside his\r\npatient, performed, I am told, miracles of skill, and did not leave\r\nher till the crisis was over. She would, I am assured, have died that\r\nevening, but she was one of the sincerest mourners at his funeral, and\r\nshe still lives to bless his memory. After all was over he went into a\r\nfriend's house and threw himself down on a sofa in a state of utter\r\nexhaustion. This was the way in which, without hope of fee or reward,\r\nand while others were waiting for him able to give him both, Sir James\r\nspent the evening preceding the election. Some will say it was no\r\ngreat matter after all. Why, for that part of it, neither was the cup\r\nof cold water which the dying Sir Philip Sidney passed from his own\r\nlips to those of a wounded soldier in greater agony than himself. But\r\nthe incident is recalled whenever his name is mentioned as adding to\r\nthe glory of the knight _sans peur et sans reproche_, and the incident\r\nI have mentioned in the Newhaven fisherman's house surely gives to Sir\r\nJames a place beside him in the glorious order of chivalrous\r\ngenerosity.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the last of the honours offered to Simpson was the Freedom of\r\nthe City of Edinburgh; a fitting tribute from the City in which and\r\nfor which he had so nobly and untiringly laboured. It was proposed to\r\npresent him with the burgess-ticket at the same time that it was\r\npublicly presented to another hero in a different sphere, Lord Napier\r\nof Magdala; but by his own desire the ceremony was postponed so far as\r\nhe was concerned in order that full honour might be paid to Lord\r\nNapier. At the eventual presentation the Lord Provost made a short\r\nspeech recapitulating the achievements for which they desired to\r\nhonour him, and referring to his reputation as being great on the\r\nbanks of the Thames and the Seine, as well as on the shores of the\r\nFirth of Forth; he likewise expressed the pride of his fellow-citizens\r\nthat Sir James had remained amongst them and had not been drawn away\r\nlike other men of genius before him by the attractions of the greater\r\nmetropolis of the south. Simpson's reply took the form of an impromptu\r\nreview of his career from the time he first entered the City as a\r\nwonderstruck boy. \"I came,\" he proudly said, \"to settle down and fight\r\namongst you a hard and up-hill battle of life for bread and name and\r\nfame, and the fact that I stand here before you this day so far\r\ntestifies that in the arduous struggle I have--won.\"\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the speeches delivered on this occasion which reached\r\nAmerica raised the indignation of Dr. Bigelow, of Boston. Reference\r\nhad been made to chloroform in a manner which appeared to slight\r\nMorton's work in introducing ether as an anaesthetic before chloroform\r\nwas heard of. In Bigelow's estimation Simpson posed as a hero at the\r\nexpense of Morton. Simpson had certainly been far from liberal in his\r\nallusions to Morton and others in his article upon Anaesthesia in the\r\n_Encyclopaedia Britannica_, and had written almost entirely about his\r\nown discovery. A controversy was excited, and on his deathbed Simpson\r\nwrote a letter to Bigelow to prove that he had duly considered the\r\npriority and the value of Morton's and Wells's work. In his concluding\r\nsentences he expressed regret at having taken up so much of his own\r\nand his correspondent's time in such a petty discussion, but blamed\r\nhis illness which prevented him from writing with the force and\r\nbrevity required. \"With many of our profession in America,\" he said,\r\n\"I have the honour of being personally acquainted, and regard their\r\nfriendship so very highly that I shall not regret this attempt--my\r\nlast, perhaps--at professional writing as altogether useless on my\r\npart if it tend to fix my name and memory duly in their love and\r\nesteem.\"\r\n\r\nThe widespread national expression of the sense of loss and of\r\nsympathy which reached Edinburgh from the United States after Sir\r\nJames's death testified to the regard in which he was held from one\r\nend to the other of that country. In Boston itself the Gynaecological\r\nSociety, of which he had been the first honorary member, convened a\r\nspecial memorial meeting, which was solemn and impressive. He had not\r\nbeen mistaken in presuming with his last breath that he held the\r\nregard of his American _confreres_.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of education Simpson held what were considered advanced\r\nopinions, but which had already been expressed by Mr. Lowe. A few\r\nyears before his death he delivered a lecture on Modern and Ancient\r\nLanguages at Granton, in which he lamented the common neglect of\r\nmodern languages in the education of the day. He had personally felt\r\nthe want of a mastery over French and German, both in the course of\r\nhis studies and during his travels; nor did he feel the want\r\ncompensated for by his ability to write and talk in Latin. He\r\nstrongly advocated the paying of more attention to the modern and\r\nless to the dead languages, and he urged that natural science should\r\ntake its place in the ordinary curriculum of the great public schools.\r\nThese views were used as an argument against his fitness for the post\r\nof Principal of the ancient University.\r\n\r\nOn three separate occasions it fell to Simpson's lot to deliver the\r\nannual address to the newly-fledged graduates, which is the duty of\r\nthe professors of the medical faculty in rotation. This ceremony\r\nremains deeply impressed in the memory of Edinburgh men, simple and\r\ndull as it undoubtedly is. The homily delivered by the orator of the\r\nday contains excellent counsels appropriate to the occasion, but\r\nthe young man eager to rise and confidently try his wings pays\r\nlittle attention to the words of wisdom; unless it be to feel wonder\r\nthat just as he is about to leave them, probably for ever, his _Alma\r\nMater_ and her priests have discovered an affectionate regard for\r\nhim and his welfare. A few years later the struggling young\r\npractitioner may perhaps turn to the copy of this graduation address,\r\nforwarded to him by post with the author's compliments, and find\r\nin such an one as Simpson delivered much to strengthen and encourage\r\nhim. In 1842 and 1855 he delivered addresses from which quotations\r\nhave already been made; and in the third one, spoken in 1868, he\r\nmade a forecast of the future of medical science, predicting _inter\r\nalia_ that by concentration of electric or other lights we should yet\r\nbe enabled to make many parts of the body sufficiently diaphanous for\r\ninspection by the practised eye of the physician. It was his habit\r\nto commit such lectures to memory and to deliver them without notes.\r\nHe was a ready public speaker on any subject in which he was\r\ninterested; speeches made on the spur of the moment teemed with\r\npleasantly-put facts and apt anecdotes from the vast storehouse of\r\nhis memory. A speech from Sir James was one of the treats in which\r\nEdinburgh folks delighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFAILING HEALTH--DEATH\r\n\r\n  Poetical instincts--Religious views--Religious and emotional\r\n  influences in his life--Doubts--Revivalism--Health--Overwork\r\n  tells--Bed--Gradual failure--Death on May 6, 1870--Grave offered\r\n  in Westminster Abbey--Buried at Warriston--Obituary notices--Bust\r\n  in the Abbey--His greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emotional part of Sir James Simpson's nature found some small\r\nexpression in versifying both, as we have seen, in early years and in\r\nlater days. We know that he was a close student of Shakspeare, but\r\nMiss Simpson states that her father probably never entered a theatre,\r\nso that he can never have seen a representation. He was familiar with\r\nmodern poets, especially with Burns. It is related that he once tested\r\na lady friend's insight into the vernacular by quoting from memory for\r\nexplanation the following lines from the national bard:--\r\n\r\n  \"Baudrons sit by the ingle-neuk,\r\n    An' wi' her loof her face she's washin',\r\n  Willie's wife it nae sae trig,\r\n    She dichts her grunzie wi' a hooschen.\"\r\n\r\nHis own verses were neither better nor worse than those written by\r\nother men whose abilities have led them to excel in more practical\r\npursuits. In youth they celebrated student life, or were, as usual,\r\ndedicated to Celia's eyebrows; in mature life they were of a more\r\nserious, and latterly of a strong religious description. At all times\r\nhe delighted in writing little doggerel verses to his children or\r\nfriends; valueless as such efforts are, they served a useful purpose;\r\ntheir composition was a recreation and pleasant relief to his\r\nover-taxed brain, while it was an amusement to him to watch their\r\neffect upon the recipients, and perhaps to receive a reply clothed\r\nalso in the garb of rhyme.\r\n\r\nSir James's example so influenced the people amongst whom he lived\r\nthat it is impossible to omit reference to his attitude throughout\r\nlife towards religion and an account of what is one of the most\r\ninteresting phases in his history. Up to Christmas, 1861, he had\r\nbeen, in the eyes of the religious public, an ordinary citizen; as\r\nregular in church-going as his professional engagements permitted;\r\nthoroughly interested in Church affairs, and a strong supporter of\r\nhis own Church; possessing to the full the national characteristic\r\nof intimate acquaintance with the letter of the Old and New\r\nTestaments; and something of a theologian as well, as his answer to\r\nthe religious objections to anaesthesia showed. At that period, to\r\nthe delight of many, and the genuine astonishment of others among\r\nhis fellow-citizens, he became a leading spirit in the strong\r\nEvangelical movement which was then spreading through the country,\r\n\"Simpson is converted,\" cried the enthusiastic revivalist. \"Simpson\r\nis converted now,\" laughed those who had opposed every action of\r\nhis. \"If Professor Simpson is converted, it is time some of the rest\r\nof us were seeing if we do not need to be converted,\" wisely\r\nanswered one of his friends. In the ordinary sense of the word Simpson\r\nwas not converted. Had he passed away without developing this\r\nlatter-day Evangelical enthusiasm, all sects would still have\r\nunited in thankfulness that such a man had lived. Why this religious\r\nrevival during the sixties affected him as it did becomes evident\r\nin looking at the religious, moral, and emotional influences which\r\naffected him throughout his career.\r\n\r\nThe simple-minded, devout mother, strong in faith and strong in works,\r\nwho passed out of his life when he was but nine years old, left a\r\nvivid impression on the boy's mind. In after years he would call up\r\nthe picture of the good woman retiring from the shop and the worries\r\nand troubles of daily life into which she had so vigorously thrown\r\nherself and so bravely faced even with failing health, into the quiet\r\nlittle room behind, to kneel down in prayer; and would describe how at\r\nother times she went about her work chanting to herself one of the old\r\nScots metrical psalms:\r\n\r\n  \"Jehovah hear thee in the day, when trouble He did send\r\n  And let the name of Jacob's God thee from all ill defend.\r\n  Let Him remember all thy gifts, accept thy sacrifice,\r\n  Grant thee thine heart's wish and fulfil thy thoughts and counsel\r\n        wise.\"\r\n\r\nHe used to relate one memory of her, touching in its simplicity: how\r\none day he entered the house with a big hole in his stocking which she\r\nperceived and drew him on to her knee to darn. As she pulled the\r\nrepaired garment on she said, \"My Jamie, when your mother's away, you\r\nwill mind that she was a grand darner.\" He remembered the words as if\r\nthey had been spoken but yesterday, and subsequently offered to a lady\r\nwho had established a girls' Industrial School in his native village a\r\nprize for the best darning.\r\n\r\nThe simple faith which beat in the life of the Bathgate baker's\r\nhousehold was ingrained into James Simpson; he went forth into the\r\nworld full of it, and full of the determination that by his fruits he\r\nshould be known.\r\n\r\nThe tender, loving care for his welfare of his sisters and brothers,\r\nparticularly of Sandy, who never faltered in his inspired belief in\r\nJames's great future, kept alive in Simpson something of his mother's\r\naffectionate nature, and kindled the sympathies and emotions which\r\nbulked so large in his character. His goodness was displayed in his\r\nkindly treatment of the poor, who formed at first the whole and\r\nafterwards no small part of his patients. When name and fame and bread\r\nwere his, he did not turn his back on the poor, but as we have seen,\r\never placed his skill at their disposal for no reward, as readily as\r\nhe yielded it to the greatest in the land. As in his daily practice,\r\nso in his greatest professional efforts, the revelation of chloroform,\r\nthe fight for anaesthesia, the introduction of acupressure, the crusade\r\nagainst hospitalism, one thought breathed through his work--that he\r\nmight do something to better the condition of suffering humanity. He\r\nnever attempted to keep discoveries in his own hands, to profit by the\r\nmonopoly, but scattered wide the knowledge which had come to him that\r\nit might benefit mankind and grow stronger and wider in the hands of\r\nother workers.\r\n\r\nIn his domestic life he was a tender, loving, and companionable\r\nhusband and father, a charming host, and a warm-hearted friend. \"In\r\nthis Edinburgh of ours,\" says a recent writer, \"there are familiar\r\nfaces whose expression changes greatly at the mention of his name;\r\nthere are men whose speech from formal and precise turns headlong and\r\nextravagant, as if it came from a new and inspired vocabulary.\" In\r\nScotland his personal influence was immense. As was afterwards written\r\nof him, \"Great in his art, and peerless in resource, yet greater was\r\nhe in his own great soul;\" such a man stood in no need of the violent\r\nrevolution in mode of life implied in conversion. A gradual process of\r\ndevelopment led to his feeling that although to labour was to pray,\r\nthere was a need for more attention to the spiritual, even in his\r\nself-sacrificing life.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that during a brief period of his career Simpson\r\nbecame affected by speculative doubts; indeed it would have been\r\nsurprising if his mind had not been affected by some of the new\r\nschools of thought which sprang up in the footsteps of Charles Darwin,\r\nand appeared for a time to threaten a mortal antagonism to all that\r\nwas dear to orthodox Christians. But these did not influence him long;\r\ntrue to his character he examined every new thought and finding it\r\nwanting remained firm in his old and tried faith, and ranged himself\r\non the side of those who perceived nothing seriously incompatible\r\nbetween religion and modern science.\r\n\r\nIn his bearing, when the angel of sorrow afflicted his household with\r\nno unsparing hand, we find him always a religious-minded man. The\r\nfirst trial was the loss of the eldest child, his daughter Maggie,\r\nin 1844. Another daughter, Mary, was lost in early infancy. In\r\n1848 his friend of boyhood and student days, Professor John Reid, was\r\nsmitten with a painful malady and died after a prolonged period of\r\nsuffering during which, knowing that the shadow of death was hanging\r\nover him, he devoted himself in retirement to religious thoughts.\r\nExperiences such as these made Simpson pause and question himself.\r\nBrimful of life and vigour, however much he came in contact with\r\ndeath in his professional rounds, the sight of it in his own inner\r\ncircle powerfully stirred his emotional nature. His friend the Rev.\r\nDr. Duns noticed in him after these sad events a gradually\r\nincreasing earnestness in his spiritual life, and a closer inquiry\r\ninto the meanings of the Scriptures. He sought out the company, and\r\nplaced himself under the influence of those among his patients whom he\r\nknew to possess fervid religious temperaments. The last mental\r\nstumbling-block was the question of prayer; he had seriously\r\ndoubted in examining the question intellectually that human prayer\r\ncould influence the purpose of the Deity. It is difficult, if not\r\npresumptuous, to inquire into the process whereby, under the\r\nguidance of spiritually minded friends, his doubts were satisfied.\r\n\r\n          \"... One indeed I knew\r\n  In many a subtle question versed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"He fought his doubts and gathered strength,\r\n    He would not make his judgment blind,\r\n    He faced the spectres of the mind,\r\n  And laid them--thus he came at length\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"To find a stronger faith his own.\"\r\n\r\nThe simple earnest faith of his fathers in which he had commenced\r\nlife, ran all through his mature years and prompted his strong\r\npurposeful energies. After the combat with the only seriously\r\nperplexing doubt he re-embraced his faith with the simplicity of a\r\nchild and the strength of a giant. For one accustomed to apply to\r\nevery subject taken in hand the rigid process of careful scientific\r\ninvestigation, it required no small effort to lay aside his usual\r\nmethods and suffer himself to be led wholly by faith.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible for Simpson to enter into any movement without\r\ntaking a prominent part in it. That Christmas Day on which all doubts\r\nleft him was followed by days of extraordinarily zealous work, such as\r\nwould have been expected of him after he had convinced himself that he\r\nhad a mission to spread abroad this, the latest, and, in his opinion,\r\nthe greatest, of his discoveries. He plunged at once into the midst of\r\nEvangelical societies, missions, and prayer-meetings, amongst the\r\nupper and lower classes of Edinburgh, and made excursions into the\r\nmining districts of his native county to deliver addresses. He\r\ninterested himself in the education of theological students, and in\r\nforeign missions, and added to his literary work the writing of\r\nreligious addresses, tracts and hymns. His example had a powerful\r\ninfluence in Edinburgh. It is said that he frequently addressed on a\r\nSunday evening Evangelical assemblies of two thousand persons. The\r\nnews of his so-called conversion was gleefully spread by well-meaning\r\nfolks, who had given credence to statements published by his enemies,\r\nand imagined that here was a bad if a great man turned aside from the\r\nbroad to the narrow path. This enthusiastic revival movement died down\r\nin time, and Simpson returned to his ordinary everyday life.\r\n\r\nMore sorrow soon fell to his lot. In 1862 his fifth child, James, who\r\nhad always been an invalid, was taken from him at the age of fifteen.\r\nIn 1866 the sad death of Dr. David Simpson, the eldest son, which has\r\nalready been referred to, was followed in about a month's time by that\r\nof the eldest surviving daughter, Jessie, at the age of seventeen. The\r\ndeath of James, a sweet-natured child, stimulated him in the revival\r\nwork. Pious friends had surrounded the little sufferer and led him to\r\nadd his innocent influence in exciting his father's religious\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that Simpson perceived much insincerity in\r\nthe revival movement, and attempted to dissociate himself from active\r\nparticipation in it, on account of finding it impossible to work in\r\nharmony with some who, though loud in profession, flagrantly failed in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Simpson's health has been little referred to in these\r\npages, because throughout his life he paid little attention to it. The\r\nchief remedy for the feeling of indisposition was change of work. He\r\nfound it impossible to be idle, and sought as recreation occupations\r\nsuch as archaeological research, or a scamper round foreign hospitals,\r\nwhich to most people would have savoured more of labour. The part of\r\nhis body which was most worked, his nervous system, was naturally the\r\none which most often troubled him with disorder; like other great men\r\nof high mental development he suffered from time to time with severe\r\nattacks of megrim, which necessitated a few hours of rest. The\r\nblood-poisoning, for which he availed himself of Professor Syme's\r\nservices, was soon recovered from with prompt treatment ending in a\r\nforeign tour; but after it little illnesses became more frequent, and\r\nhe was perforce occasionally confined to the house. During these times\r\nhe busied himself, for the sake of occupation and to distract his\r\nattention from his sufferings, in professional reading or the\r\npreparation of literary papers. Rheumatic troubles became frequent,\r\nand soon after his eldest son's death he had to run over to the Isle\r\nof Man to free himself from a severe attack of sciatica.\r\n\r\nLong, weary nights spent at the bedside of patients or in tiresome\r\nrailway journeys, and exposure to all varieties of weather, had a\r\nserious effect upon him. Travelling was slow, according to modern\r\nideas, and long waits at wayside stations in winter-time helped to\r\nplay havoc with his constitution. He was well known to the railway\r\nofficials in Scotland. The figure of the great Edinburgh professor was\r\nfamiliar at many a station, striding up and down the platform with the\r\nstationmaster, chaffing the porter, or cheerily chatting to the driver\r\nand stoker leaning out of the engine. After his death many of these\r\nmen would proudly produce little mementoes of their services to him,\r\nwhich he never forgot to send.\r\n\r\nThe little rest house, Viewbank, on the Forth, had to be more\r\nfrequently sought refuge in, if only to get away from the harassing\r\nnight-bell and secure a full night's sleep. In the last year or two of\r\nhis existence he found the work of his practice and chair hard to\r\ncarry on, not because of any defined illness, but on account of the\r\nloss of that buoyant elasticity of constitution which had enabled him\r\nto bear without apparent effort or injury the fatigue which would have\r\nbeen sufficient to prostrate more than one ordinary man. He had early\r\ntrained himself to do with a minimum of sleep; to snatch what he could\r\nand when he could, if it were only on a sofa, a bare board, or in one\r\nof the comfortless railway carriages of the day. He took full\r\nadvantage during his career of the modern facilities for travelling\r\nwhich he had seen introduced and developed. Many a night was spent in\r\nthe train, going to or returning from a far-distant patient, or after\r\na combined professional and archaeological excursion; the next morning\r\nwould find him busy in his usual routine. On the day after receiving\r\nthe degree of D.C.L. at Oxford in 1866, he started for Devizes, which\r\nwas reached the same evening; here he had a hasty meal and drove on to\r\nAvebury to see the standing stones there. He returned at midnight, and\r\nat five o'clock next morning set off for Stonehenge, a place he had\r\nlong desired to see, thoroughly examined the remarkable remains, and\r\non his return took train to Bath, where he found time to examine more\r\nantiquities. At midnight a telegram reached him calling him\r\nprofessionally to Northumberland. He snatched a few hours' sleep, and\r\ntaking the four a.m. train to London set out for Northumberland, where\r\nhe saw his patient, and then proceeded to Edinburgh. This is no\r\nsolitary instance of his journeyings, but an example of many.\r\n\r\nWhen the year 1870 had been entered upon, he awoke to the fact that\r\nhis flesh was too weak for his eager spirit; despite this, he held on\r\nhis course, and worked without ceasing, never refusing an urgent call,\r\nalthough he now suffered from angina pectoris. On February 12th he\r\nhastened to London to give evidence in a notorious divorce case. He\r\narrived only to find that the trial had been postponed for four days.\r\nHe returned to Edinburgh on the 14th, spent the next day in\r\nprofessional visits in the country, and arrived again in London in\r\ntime to appear in the witness-box on the 16th, although chilled to the\r\nbone by the coldness of the long journey. On the following day he\r\nstopped at York on his way home, dined with Lord Houghton, and\r\nvisited, at 11 p.m., his friend Dr. Williams, in Micklegate. During\r\nthe remainder of the journey from York to Edinburgh he suffered\r\nseverely, and \"was glad to rest for awhile upon the floor of the\r\nrailway carriage.\"\r\n\r\nA few days after this last run to London he was summoned to see a\r\npatient in Perth, but was this time so fatigued by the effort, that\r\nafter his return on February 25th he was obliged to take to bed. The\r\nnews sped to all quarters of the globe that Simpson was gravely ill,\r\nfor nothing but grave illness could compel that vigorous man to\r\ncompletely lay down his work.\r\n\r\nHis symptoms improved at first under appropriate treatment\r\nsufficiently to allow him to be placed on a bed in the drawing-room;\r\nand he even once more took up his favourite archaeology, revising some\r\nof his work in that subject. Patients also were not to be denied; many\r\nwere seen and prescribed for in his sick room, some even being carried\r\nup to his presence. But the fatal disease regained ascendancy, and the\r\nfact became apparent to all, not excepting himself, that the last\r\nchapter of the closely written book of his life had been entered upon.\r\nTowards the end of March, by his own request, his eldest surviving son\r\nwas telegraphed for to be near him, and he wrote a touching letter to\r\nhis youngest son, then a student in Geneva, encouraging him in his\r\nstudies, asking him to look for cup-markings cut in the curious islet\r\nrock in Lake Geneva, and ending with an expression of his feeling of\r\nimpending death, for which he felt perfectly and happily prepared. In\r\nthese last days he loved to have his nearest and dearest around him;\r\nLady Simpson and others read to him, and his daughter tells us how she\r\ndaily prepared her school lessons in the sick room with his help; to\r\nthe last he interested himself in the work of his relations and\r\nfriends. He answered the attack of Bigelow, of Boston, conscious that\r\nit was his last effort on behalf of chloroform, and wrote to all his\r\nold opponents asking their forgiveness if at any time words of his had\r\nwounded their feelings. He might well have spared himself the\r\nregrets--such as they were--which troubled him. \"I would have liked\r\nto have completed hospitalism,\" he said, \"but I hope some good man\r\nwill take it up.\" On another occasion he asked, \"How old am I?\r\nFifty-nine? Well, I have done some work. I wish I had been busier.\"\r\n\r\nHe expressed a desire that his nephew should succeed him in the Chair\r\nof Midwifery--he would, he thought, help to perpetuate his treatment.\r\n\r\nThere was much communing with himself on his future, and all his\r\nsayings on the subject breathed the simple faith first inculcated in\r\nhim in the Bathgate cottage. His great sufferings, sometimes allayed\r\nby opiates and his own chloroform, were bravely borne, but the days\r\ndragged sadly on. On the evening of May 5th Sandy took his place at\r\nhis side, and the last conscious moments of the great physician were\r\nspent with his head in the arms of him who had helped and guided him\r\nthrough the difficult days of his career. At sunset on May 6th he\r\npassed peacefully away.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the feeling evoked by the tidings of his death was\r\nrepresented in Mr. Gladstone's remark that it was a grievous loss to\r\nthe nation and was truly a national concern. There was a universally\r\nexpressed opinion that he merited without a shadow of doubt the rare\r\nnational honour of public interment in Westminster Abbey. A committee\r\nwas formed out of the leading medical men in London to carry out this\r\nsuggestion. Their task was light, for the Dean acceded to the request\r\nat once. Much as his family and the Scots people valued this tribute\r\nto his greatness, they decided otherwise. Scotland has no counterpart\r\nof Westminster in which to lay to rest those whom she feels to have\r\nbeen her greatest; but Edinburgh felt that she could not part with him\r\nwho in life had been her possession and her pride. He had long ago\r\nchosen a piece of ground in the Warriston cemetery, and Lady Simpson\r\ndecided, to the gratification of his fellow-citizens, that he should\r\nbe buried there beside the five children who had preceded him. His\r\nresting place was well chosen; it nestled into the side of the\r\nbeautiful city, and from it could be viewed some of the chief objects\r\nof the scene he knew so well--on the south the stately rock crowned\r\nwith the ancient castle, and the towering flats of the old town\r\nstretching away to Arthur's Seat; on the north the long stretch of the\r\nFirth of Forth and in the distance on the one hand the Ochills; on the\r\nother the Bass Rock.\r\n\r\nThe funeral was one of the most remarkable ever witnessed in Scotland.\r\nIt took place on May 13th in the presence of a crowd estimated to\r\nconsist of thirty thousand persons. The hearse was followed by a\r\nrepresentative procession comprising close upon two thousand persons.\r\nHis own relatives assembled at 52, Queen Street, the general public\r\nand the Town Council in the Free Church of St. Luke, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the University, the Colleges of Physicians and\r\nSurgeons, and the Royal Society and many other public bodies, in the\r\nHall of the College of Physicians. At each of these meeting-places\r\nreligious services were held. The whole city ceased to labour that\r\nafternoon in order to pay the last tribute to its dearly loved\r\nprofessor. The poor mourned in the crowd as deeply and genuinely as\r\nthose with whom he had been closely associated in life mourned as they\r\nfollowed his remains in the procession. Every mourner grieved from a\r\nsense of personal loss, so deeply had his influence sunk down into the\r\nhearts of the people.\r\n\r\nThe companion of his troubles and his triumphs, who had bravely joined\r\nhim to help him to the fame he strove after, was soon laid beside him.\r\nLady Simpson died on June 17th of the same year.\r\n\r\nBut two notes were struck in the countless obituary notices and\r\nletters of condolence which appeared from far and near--those of\r\nappreciation of his great nature, and sorrow for the terrible loss\r\nsustained by science and humanity. The Queen caused the Duke of Argyle\r\nto express to the family her own personal sorrow at the loss of \"so\r\ngreat and good a man.\" A largely attended meeting was held in\r\nWashington to express the feeling of his own profession in the United\r\nStates, at which Dr. Storer moved, \"that in Dr. Simpson, American\r\nphysicians recognise not merely an eminent and learned Scots\r\npractitioner, but a philanthropist whose love encircled the world; a\r\ndiscoverer who sought and found for suffering humanity in its sorest\r\nneed a foretaste of the peace of heaven, and a devoted disciple of the\r\nonly true physician, our Saviour Jesus Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThe following original verses from the pen of a well-known scholar in\r\nthe profession, were given prominence in the columns of the\r\n_Lancet_:--\r\n\r\nPROMETHEUS.\r\n\r\n(Our lamented Sir James Simpson was the subject of angina pectoris.)\r\n\r\n          1\r\n\r\n  \"Alas! alas! pain, pain, ever forever!\"\r\n  So groaned upon his rock that Titan good\r\n  Who by his brave and loving hardihood\r\n  Was to weak man of priceless boons the giver,\r\n  Which e'en the supreme tyrant could not sever\r\n  From us, once given; we own him in our food\r\n  And in our blazing hearth's beatitude;\r\n  Yet still his cry was \"Pain, ever forever!\"\r\n\r\n  Shall we a later, harder doom rehearse?\r\n  One came whose art men's dread of are repressed:\r\n  Mangled and writhing limb he lulled to rest,\r\n  And stingless left the old Semitic curse;\r\n  Him, too, for these blest gifts did Zeus amerce?\r\n  He, too, had vultures tearing at his breast.\r\n\r\n          2\r\n\r\n  Hush, Pagan plaints! our Titan is unbound;\r\n  The cruel beak and talons scared away;\r\n  As once upon his mother's lap he lay\r\n  So rests his head august on holy ground;\r\n  Spells stronger than his own his pangs have found;\r\n  He hears no clamour of polemic fray,\r\n  Nor reeks he what unthankful men may say;\r\n  Nothing can vex him in that peace profound.\r\n\r\n  And where his loving soul, his genius bold?\r\n  In slumber? or already sent abroad\r\n  On angels' wings and works, as some men hold?\r\n  Or waiting Evolution's change, unawed?\r\n  All is a mystery, as Saint Paul has told,\r\n  Saying, \"Your life is hid with Christ in God.\"\r\n\r\nIn a peaceful corner of the St. Andrew Chapel in Westminster Abbey,\r\nalongside memorials of Sir Humphry Davy and a few other scientists of\r\nnote, stands a speaking image in marble--perhaps the most expressive\r\nrepresentation that exists--of this wonderful man,\r\n\r\n          \"To whose genius and benevolence\r\n          The world owes the blessings derived\r\n          From the use of chloroform for\r\n          The relief of suffering.\r\n          LAUS DEO.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Jonathan Hutchinson, when writing to the medical journals in\r\nsupport of the proposal to secure Simpson's burial in Westminster\r\nAbbey, foretold that his reputation would ripen with years, that\r\njealousies would be forgotten, and antagonism would be buried.\r\nTwenty-seven years have elapsed since then, and few remain with whom\r\nhe came in conflict; those who do remain exchanged, along with others\r\nof his opponents, friendly words of reconciliation in the end, and\r\ntook the hand which he held out from his deathbed. As a man, Simpson\r\nhad his faults; but they were exaggerated in his lifetime by some,\r\njust as his capabilities and achievements were magnified by those who\r\nworshipped him as inspired. He was full of sympathy for mankind,\r\nbenevolent and honest to a fault, and forbearing to his enemies. He\r\nrushed eagerly into the combat and oftentimes wounded sorely, and\r\nperhaps unnecessarily. His genius was essentially a reforming genius,\r\nand impelled him to fight for his ends, for genius is always the\r\n\"master of man.\" We can forgive him if sometimes it caused him to\r\nfight too vigorously, where the heart of a man of mere talent might\r\nhave failed and lost. His social charms were excelled only by his\r\nmarvellous energy, his prodigious memory, and his keenness of insight;\r\nbut he was regrettably inattentive to the details of ordinary everyday\r\nlife and practice.\r\n\r\nHe approached the study of medicine when the darkness of the Middle\r\nAges was still upon it, and was one of the first to point out that\r\nalthough many diseases appeared incurable, they were nevertheless\r\npreventable. Although no brilliant operator himself, he so transformed\r\nthe surgical theatre by his revelation of the power of chloroform, and\r\nby his powerful advocacy of the use of anaesthetics, that pain was shut\r\nout and vast scientific possibilities opened up; many of which have\r\nbeen brilliantly realised by subsequent workers. He devoted himself\r\nspecially to the despised obstetric art, fighting for what he\r\nrecognised as the most lowly and neglected branch of his profession,\r\nranging his powerful forces on the side of the weak, and left it the\r\nmost nearly perfect of medical sciences.\r\n\r\nHe was enthusiastic in his belief in progress, and in the power of\r\nsteady, honest work to effect great ends. With the exception of the\r\ntime of that temporary burst into revivalism in 1861, his motto\r\nthroughout life might very well have been _laborare est orare_. He was\r\nno believer in speculations, but curiously enough kept for recreation\r\nonly the subject of archaeology, in which he entered into many\r\nintricate speculative studies. In his professional work he avoided\r\nspeculation, and never adopted a theory which was not built upon firm\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nIf we are asked for what we are most to honour Simpson, we answer, not\r\nso much for the discoveries he made, not for the instruments he\r\ninvented, not for his exposure of numerous evils, not for the\r\nintroduction of reforms, not for any particular contribution to\r\nscience, literature, or archaeology; but rather for the inspiring life\r\nof the man looked at both in outline and in detail. He was guided by\r\nhigh ideals, and a joyous unhesitating belief that all good things\r\nwere possible--that right must prevail. He was stimulated by a genius\r\nwhich, as has been pointed out, gave him the energy to fight for his\r\nends with herculean strength. The fact that chloroform was by his\r\nefforts alone accepted as _the_ anaesthetic, and ether, which from the\r\nfirst was generally thought to be safer in ordinary hands, was\r\ndeliberately put on one side practically all over the world, testified\r\nto his forcible and convincing method, and to his power of making\r\nothers see as he saw. As a man of science alone, as a philanthropist\r\nalone, as a worker alone, as a reformer alone, he was great. But\r\nalthough to the popular mind he is known chiefly because of his\r\nintroduction of chloroform, medical history will record him as greater\r\nbecause of his reforming genius, and will point to the fight for\r\nanaesthesia, and his crusade against hospitalism as the best of all\r\nthat he accomplished or initiated. And he who, while making allowances\r\nfor the weaknesses of human nature which were Simpson's, studies the\r\nlife which was brought all too soon to a close, will recognise the\r\ngreat spirit which breathed through all his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of Sir James Simpson's contributions to\r\n_Archaeology_.

Simpson.\" Berlin, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOn _post mortem_ examination the following observations on Sir James\r\nSimpson's head were made:--\r\n\r\n  Skull--circumference round by occipital protuberance and below\r\n        frontal eminences, 22-1/2 inches.\r\n        --from ear to ear, 13 inches.\r\n        --from occipital protuberance to point between superciliary\r\n        ridges, 13 inches.\r\n  Brain--weight of entire brain (cerebrum and cerebellum) was 54\r\n        ounces; the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata weighed\r\n        5-1/4 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe convolutions of the cerebrum were remarkable for their number,\r\ndepth, and intricate foldings. This was noticed more particularly in\r\nthe anterior lobes and the islands of Reil.\r\n\r\nExtract from _British Medical Journal_, May 14, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n

Hence the idea of the present series.\r\nThese biographies, concise but full, popular but authoritative, have\r\nbeen designed with the view of giving in each case an adequate picture\r\nof the builder in relation to his work.\r\n\r\nThe series will be under the general editorship of Mr. H.

The first to appear will be a\r\nLife of Sir Waiter Ralegh, by Major Hume, the learned author of \"The\r\nYear after the Armada.\" Others in contemplation will deal with the\r\nCabots, the quarter-centenary of whose sailing from Bristol has\r\nrecently been celebrated in that city, as well as in Canada and\r\nNewfoundland; is Sir Thomas Maitland, the \"King Tom\" of the\r\nMediterranean; Rajah Brooke, Sir Stamford Raffles, Lord Clive, Edward\r\nGibbon Wakefield, Zachary Macaulay, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nThe Series has taken for its motto the Miltonic prayer:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou Who of Thy free grace didst build up this Brittannick\r\n  Empire to a glorious and enviable height.
