During my stay with him I happened to hear one\r\nevening that an emigrant ship appointed to sail next day to Port Natal\r\nwould most probably be detained by the sudden illness of the surgeon\r\nsuperintendent who had governmental charge. The vacancy was offered to\r\nme on condition that I should at once pass the official examination\r\nrequired of every medical man before he can be legally entrusted with\r\nthe care of government emigrants. Early next morning, therefore, I\r\nappeared before Mr. Le Gros Clark, the appointed examiner, and\r\nsuccessfully passing this extra examination joined on the same afternoon\r\nthe good ship _Tugela_, Captain Stewart, bound with emigrants to Port\r\nNatal, South Africa. Sailing at once, I had for the first time an\r\nopportunity to look round at my fellow voyagers, who were chiefly\r\ncomposed of honest English yeomen with their families seeking to better\r\ntheir fortunes. The officers as time went on I found to be good men and\r\ntrue, the chief especially, whose sterling qualities, of which but a few\r\nyears after he gave signal proof, I soon learned to appreciate. His\r\nmemory is now all that remains; yet many of my readers and especially of\r\nmy fellow passengers will have recognized in the noble hero of the\r\n_Northfleet_, the same Knowles of the _Tugela_, who on the fatal night\r\nof January 22d, 1873, when his ship lay at anchor between Folkestone and\r\nDungeness, with 400 men, women and children on board, bound for\r\nTasmania, was run into and sunk by a foreign steamer. I remember reading\r\nhow chivalrously he endeavored to rescue the women and children, and how\r\nwith his revolver he shot down those who in a cowardly manner tried to\r\nseize the boats. As said at the time, “he died at his post, sinking with\r\nhis ship, having acted with a calmness, promptitude and decision that\r\nwill cover his memory with honor.”\r\n\r\nThe position of medical superintendent on board an emigrant ship I soon\r\nfound was in one sense no sinecure, but I quickly learned the art of\r\nadjusting opposing social elements, and lulling the brewing storms,\r\nwhich, as there was neither sickness nor accident during our voyage,\r\nwere the only cases (?) about which I was consulted.\r\n\r\nTime dragged slowly on. Since bidding “good-bye” to old England on\r\nDecember 3d, 1864, the eighty-four days we spent together on board the\r\n_Tugela_ passed monotonously yet pleasantly enough, our enforced\r\nidleness being broken only by alternate storms and calms, the distant\r\nview of passing ships, and the comparatively uninteresting episodes of\r\nemigrant life, until on Sunday morning, February 5th, 1865, the “golden\r\nshores” of the Promised Land to which we were bound, burst upon our\r\nview. Running before a fair wind in sight of land, we feasted our eyes\r\nfor a few hours, as we sailed along at a distance of one or two miles,\r\non the lofty cliffs with their grass-clad, table-topped summits, which\r\ncommand the mouth of the Umzimvubu, the “Gates” of St. John’s River, and\r\nexcited were the discussions we indulged in about the reported resources\r\nand fertility of the land to which we were destined. We were a long\r\ntime, however, in coasting to Natal, and it can well be imagined how our\r\ndesire and curiosity increased. At last the early morn of February 25th\r\nfound us laying at anchor outside the bar of the harbor of Natal. Words\r\ncannot depict the intentness with which we surveyed the bluff, standing\r\nlike a sentinel on guard at the south entrance of the bay, and admired\r\nthe tropical vegetation with which it was clothed from base to summit;\r\nneither can I put into words the interest we felt as we gazed at the\r\nrolling breakers, and the eager anxiety with which we watched the\r\nsluggish approach of the lighter destined to land us on the shores of a\r\nnew country. As all the emigrants under my charge landed in good health\r\nafter the long voyage, the gratification that I felt was very great. I\r\nwill not attempt to describe the hearty greetings of friends long\r\nseparated, the tender embraces of husband and wife, of parent and child,\r\nagain united, nor the shy, coy, loving looks of some, which threw out a\r\nsuggestion of an anticipated happy future.\r\n\r\nPassing my luggage through the custom-house, I rode up to D’Urban from\r\nthe point along a deep, sandy bush path, skirted on both sides by a\r\ntangled mass of tropical vegetation, forming a dense undergrowth to fine\r\nforest trees, and went to the “Royal,” kept at that time by a good\r\nfellow named Jessup, who years afterward “played the part of a\r\nBoniface,” as the saying is, at the diamond fields.\r\n\r\nHaving a few days to wait here until the next mail steamer sailed to\r\nEngland, I happened in conversation casually to hear of a vacancy in the\r\nNatal government medical service, caused by the sudden death of a\r\ndistrict surgeon in Victoria County, the most enterprising and rising\r\nportion of the whole colony. The following morning, while taking\r\nbreakfast, two gentlemen, whom I afterward knew as large sugar planters\r\non the coast, joined the table and began talking over the events of the\r\nweek. “So he’s dead at last,” said one. “Yes, and who’ll take his place,\r\nI wonder?” said the other. After some further conversation, I gathered\r\nthat the report I had heard of the sudden death of a doctor was correct,\r\nand that it was about him they were conversing. The chief speaker\r\ncontinued: “He made £700 a year, but could have made double if he’d\r\nliked.” Hearing all this, I introduced myself and told them who I was,\r\nwhen, with colonial frankness, they both strongly urged me to apply at\r\nonce to the government for the appointment.\r\n\r\nI did not require to think twice over the matter, visions of £1,000 a\r\nyear at two-and-twenty floated temptingly before me, so deciding at\r\nonce, I determined to go to the capital, Pietermaritzburg, and see\r\nColonel Maclean, who was acting governor at the time. This I did next\r\nday, and the colonel gave me the acting appointment.\r\n\r\nBeing anxious as quickly as possible to see the district and people\r\namong whom, for at least a time, I had thrown my lot, immediately on my\r\nreturn to D’Urban I lost no time in visiting Verulam, the chief town of\r\nVictoria County, which was founded, I was told, in 1850 by a party of\r\nWesleyan pioneers. Riding four miles through terrible sand, I crossed\r\nthe Umgeni by a beautiful iron-girder bridge, afterward washed away by a\r\nsudden rising of the river in August, 1868, passed Jackson’s coffee\r\nestate and some extensive bush clearings, and then a few miles more\r\nbrought me to Lovatt’s well-known roadside inn. All the way to Verulam,\r\nthe place of my future residence, the landscape was studded near and far\r\nwith thick forests, interspersed with sugar and coffee plantations,\r\nforming lovely little views; here and there, too, I could see smoke\r\ncurling up from the fires where the planters were burning the timber in\r\nthe forest, and many a time I halted my horse to watch around the\r\nblazing logs the groups of lithe, active, happy natives, laughing,\r\nsinging and working by turn—a novel sight, indeed, to one accustomed to\r\nEnglish coldness and stolidity.\r\n\r\nLeaving behind Lister’s pretty coffee trees and banana groves, Smerdon’s\r\nmill and extensive sugar fields, I crossed the Umhlanga River, so named\r\nby the Kafirs from the reeds on its banks, which nearly hide it from\r\nview, and ascending a steep cutting along the side of a hill named\r\nKaht’s Kop, caught sight at last, at a turn of the road, of the village\r\nof Verulam, lying snugly ensconced in a hollow among the hills on the\r\nbanks of the Umhloti River. Another mile brought me to my journey’s end.\r\nTurning the sharp corner of a neglected graveyard, a pretty church on\r\none side of the road, and on the other a sweet little thatched cottage,\r\nliterally smothered with honeysuckles, and which I soon learned was the\r\nparsonage, greeted my view.\r\n\r\nPutting up my horse at the inn, I called and paid my respects to the\r\nresident magistrate, Dr. Blaine, a member of my own profession. After\r\nlunching with him, we walked round the village, and he introduced me to\r\nthe principal inhabitants, not omitting the worthy vicar, the Rev. W. A.\r\nElder, and his wife, who were kind enough to invite me to take up my\r\nresidence with them. A few more days saw me settled down, and I\r\ncommenced regular practice in the county on April 3d, 1865.\r\n\r\nSugar was at that time paying handsomely and coffee promising well, and\r\nconsequently good wages were given to native laborers; yet the planters,\r\nalthough surrounded by a large Kafir population, were never able to rely\r\non obtaining a regular supply of labor, as the native was too\r\nindependent, the young men merely working until they were able to save\r\nenough money to buy cattle sufficient to pay for a wife. The consequence\r\nwas that the planters, although surrounded by hundreds of thousands of\r\nnatives, had been compelled, about six years before my arrival, to\r\norganize a system of coolie immigration from India. One of the\r\nagreements they were obliged to enter into with the Indian government\r\nwas that regular medical supervision should be provided for all\r\nimmigrants; and to defray this cost, the planter was authorized to make\r\na deduction of one shilling a month from the wages of each coolie.\r\n\r\nI soon became acquainted with all the planters in my division of the\r\ncounty, and found that a regular visit once a month to each estate,\r\ncombined with the exigencies of a private practice, kept me busy, “week\r\nin, week out, from morn till night.”\r\n\r\nThe planter of those days I found an excellent type of colonist. He was\r\ngenerally a man of means, well educated, “a good fellow,” young, and\r\ndrawn from the English upper middle class. In some few individual cases\r\nthere might be a want of ballast, but colonial experience, soon gained,\r\nsupplied the deficiency. My range of practice extended from the cotton\r\ncompany’s plantation at the Umhlali to Kennedy’s sugar estate on the\r\nUmgeni River, a district forty-five miles long, and extending inland, as\r\na rule, about seven miles. Within this area I attended, as nearly as I\r\ncan remember, twenty-five estates, employing on an average 1,600\r\nindentured coolies. When, after a long absence, I visited Verulam this\r\nyear, I found matters greatly altered. Hospitals had been built there\r\nand at Avoca, a village some twelve miles distant, to which any\r\nimportant cases from the surrounding estates were sent. My old district\r\nhad been divided into three medical circles, with three doctors to do\r\nthe work which I used to do single-handed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n      PREVAILING DISEASES IN NATAL.—INCIDENT AT MR.

ELDER.—OUTBREAK OF THE DIAMOND FEVER.—SAIL FOR INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of Natal I found extremely healthy, the average death-rate\r\nbeing only 16 per 1000 among the white population, while among the\r\nnatives, judging from all inquiries, I do not think it amounted to half\r\nthat number, though this is more or less surmise, as unfortunately among\r\nthe latter no official returns were kept.\r\n\r\nDuring my practice in Victoria County, extending over six years, I do\r\nnot think there were twenty deaths among the white population, and as\r\nfor the coolies, the change from India seemed to give them a new lease\r\nof life.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the lungs, bronchitis and other chest complaints were\r\nrare, and when they did occur were seldom fatal, the principal diseases\r\nof importance being dysentery, low malarial fever (bilio-remittent) and\r\na peculiar form of hœmaturia, due to a parasite named the _Distoma\r\nhæmatobium_, introduced into the system by the drinking of impure water.\r\nI must not forget also to mention that an outbreak of diphtheria took\r\nplace before my arrival in 1859, which was the first time this disease\r\nwas known in Natal, and also that every now and then a severe form of\r\nchicken-pox broke out among the Kafirs, which more than once gave\r\noccasion for alarm, the malady having been mistaken for small-pox.\r\nAsiatic cholera and hydrophobia have never been known.\r\n\r\nAlthough not dangerous to life, yet as peculiar to this colony, I ought\r\nto mention the Natal sore, a species of inflammatory boil, of a low\r\ncongestive nature, with which new arrivals were almost always troubled.\r\n\r\nThese sores were often produced by the irritating bite of an insect\r\nknown under the name of the tick (_ixodes_), of which there are\r\ndifferent species, and also by the bite of the mosquito.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the larger species of tick having fastened upon animals in\r\nsuch places as the ear, mane, etc., where they could not be rubbed off,\r\nbecome gorged with blood to the size of haricot beans. Those which\r\nattack men are much smaller. Ticks have no wings, no eyes, no mouth,\r\nmerely legs, a pair of sharp, delicate lancets, and a pipe or rostrum\r\ncovered over externally with small reflexed teeth, which they plunge\r\ninto the skin, and then suck away, holding on by their barbs. Dr. Mann,\r\nformerly superintendent of education in Natal, writes: “this much,\r\nhowever, must be said even for these blind, bloodthirsty insects, their\r\nreality is not so bad as their reputation;” so that again we have an\r\ninstance of an enemy of man not being so black as he is painted.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 I treated many cases of malarial fever in Victoria County, most\r\nof them, however, occurring close to lagoons on the coast, and though I\r\nmet with other scattered cases of it in the country, this was the only\r\noutbreak which could be entitled absolutely epidemic.\r\n\r\nI recollect in May of that year I had 120 cases among the whites and\r\ncoolies on a sugar estate, which was situated on the sea-coast, near the\r\nmouth of the Umgeni River; but the fever was confined to this estate and\r\nVerulam, where I had four cases, the total mortality, to the best of my\r\nrecollection, numbering nine.\r\n\r\nThe cases of dysentery, on the other hand, were often perfectly\r\nintractable, and would sometimes yield to no mode of treatment, and this\r\nwas especially the case at the end of summer, when the experience of a\r\nsudden chill would almost certainly induce the disease. Sickness was\r\nmost prevalent, if care were not taken, at the change of the seasons,\r\nand when rains of an exceptional character took place, cases both of\r\nfever and dysentery of a severe type were always expected. After the\r\ndisastrous flood of August, 1868, these expectations were realized to an\r\nunusual extent. This great flood lasted from August 28th to the 31st,\r\ninclusive, the downfall of rain being greater than the oldest\r\ninhabitants could recollect, 15.60 inches falling in 48 hours, and 17.11\r\ninches during the four days that the storm continued.\r\n\r\nI had a very narrow escape at the time, when going to visit the manager\r\nof Fenton Vacy, a sugar estate about four miles from Verulam. This\r\ngentleman had been under my care for some days, suffering from a most\r\nacute attack of dysentery, from which, I regret to say, he eventually\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nA tremendous rain, which at the time I allude to had continued two days,\r\nhad caused the rivers along the coast to rise from twenty to thirty\r\nfeet, washing away both the cane from the fields and the coffee trees\r\nfrom the hillsides. In addition, it carved out impassable gullies in the\r\nroads, and choking up the rivers themselves with the carcasses of dead\r\noxen, broken reeds and trunks of trees, flooded the surrounding lands,\r\nand brought everything to a stand-still. Notwithstanding the terrible\r\ndriving storm, I did not like the poor fellow to die all alone, without\r\na last effort to save him, so mounting one of my best horses, I rode as\r\nfar on the way as Mr. Tom Milner’s, one of Natal’s oldest sugar\r\nplanters, at Redcliffe, where I had to cross a stream at a drift close\r\nin front of his mill. When I arrived there, the water was running like a\r\nmill-race, but as Fenton Vacy lay on the other side, I determined to\r\nmake an attempt to get through. In the _Field_, some time after, I read\r\na full and accurate account of my adventure, names only being altered,\r\nwritten by a visitor who was stopping for a few days at Redcliffe, and\r\nas the article contains an accurate description of the class of rain\r\nstorms to which Natal is occasionally liable, I shall take the liberty\r\nof reproducing it. The writer says:\r\n\r\n  “After spending a few pleasant days at the Royal Hotel, D’Urban, I was\r\n  told that a trip to Victoria County was the thing every one ought to\r\n  do, and that the planters were always glad to receive visitors lately\r\n  out from England. Accordingly, having had a horse lent me, I started\r\n  on a little tour, intending to visit some of the principal estates.\r\n  The chief caution the old hands gave me at D’Urban was, ‘Look out for\r\n  the rains, and when they come, don’t attempt crossing any river by\r\n  yourself,’ the soundness of which advice I had ample means of testing\r\n  before my return.\r\n\r\n  “The first river on my road was the Umgeni, stretching across which\r\n  was an iron bridge, at this time a good forty feet above the stream,\r\n  which was running rapidly but smoothly out to sea, distant some half\r\n  mile or so. This bridge had been erected at great cost and trouble,\r\n  and was pronounced to be strong enough to resist any flood.\r\n\r\n  “After a day’s hard riding I arrived at a sugar estate in Victoria\r\n  County, and received from its owner a pressing invitation to remain a\r\n  day or two and look round the place.\r\n\r\n  “All the week heavy showers had been falling, off and on, yet there\r\n  was nothing to indicate alarm to an uninitiated eye. But after dinner,\r\n  while we were sitting in the verandah enjoying our pipes and watching\r\n  the clouds as they swept past, my host suddenly exclaimed: ‘If this\r\n  east wind lasts through the night, we shall have a flood before three\r\n  days are over, if not sooner. It was just such a night as this ten\r\n  years ago, and very much the same time of year (about the middle of\r\n  August), when we had one of the worst floods that have occurred in the\r\n  colony. That stream which you crossed to-day, near our mill, rose a\r\n  good thirty or forty feet, and you will notice to-morrow that we have\r\n  made that allowance in choosing a site for our buildings. I don’t\r\n  believe it ever has risen more than this; but if it ever should, it\r\n  will carry everything before it.’\r\n\r\n  “Next morning, Melville, my host, was up before me, pacing the\r\n  verandah, and grumbling to himself. On my asking ‘What’s the matter?’\r\n  he came out with ‘Don’t you see, or didn’t you hear, that, just after\r\n  we turned in last night, one of the most tremendous storms we have had\r\n  for years came on? It’s been raining bucketfuls all night! And there’s\r\n  that manager of mine, sleeping down close alongside the reservoir and\r\n  mill, has never rung the bell yet to muster all hands, when he ought\r\n  to have had every man out half an hour ago, looking after the drains\r\n  and water courses. If you want to see a flood, you have got here just\r\n  in time.’\r\n\r\n  “The house stood on a hill about three hundred yards from the mill and\r\n  the other premises, which consisted of manager’s house, engineer’s\r\n  cottage, coolie and Kafir huts. Hurrying down there as fast as\r\n  possible, we found all the men quiet enough, although the waters and\r\n  river were beginning to show what might happen.\r\n\r\n  “To supply a water-power mill, which did duty partly as a\r\n  cane-crusher, though used chiefly for grinding corn, there was a large\r\n  reservoir, close to the manager’s cottage and considerably above the\r\n  level of the mill and other buildings. On nearing this we found the\r\n  banks overflowing, and the water between it and the mill nearly knee\r\n  deep. Even this overflow was enough to frighten us; but we both turned\r\n  white when Melville said: ‘If those banks give way, everything must\r\n  go—mill, sugar, engine-house, and every one within reach; so look out\r\n  that we don’t find ourselves amongst the number.’ The first thing was\r\n  to ring the bell and muster all hands. There were about 100 coolies\r\n  and 200 Kafirs, headed by the manager, who by this time was up, and\r\n  the engineer, the two forming the whole white staff upon the place.\r\n  Then there was a little excitement about volunteers to get a rope\r\n  across the river, this being a usual precaution of Melville in heavy\r\n  weather. Two trees on either side were reserved for this special\r\n  purpose, and it was accomplished with great difficulty and not a\r\n  moment too soon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “IN A PARLOUS STATE.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “All that day we never left the precincts of the mill. It took us all\r\n  we knew to keep the water under, and to cut drains and cross-drains in\r\n  all directions. Several times during the heaviest showers we were\r\n  nearly beat, for the water came down, not in streams, but in sheets,\r\n  and with such force that it was difficult to stand against it. At one\r\n  time some of us were completely knocked off our feet and carried\r\n  against the mill wall, where it was nearly waist high. Fortunately\r\n  these violent rushes came but seldom, and lasted only a few minutes;\r\n  for the buildings, being of light construction, could not have\r\n  resisted such a current long, especially as the river itself at these\r\n  times rose to within a few feet of the main works. We were thus kept\r\n  constantly on the move till about 4 P. M., when the rains moderated\r\n  somewhat; and about six o’clock Melville said we might knock off work,\r\n  as he considered the premises safe, though the damage done was\r\n  considerable, and the place looked as if a party of sappers and miners\r\n  had been out under training.\r\n\r\n  “That night the rain stopped as suddenly as it had come on; and by the\r\n  following morning the temporarily made drains and water courses were\r\n  nearly dry, and the river much fallen, though still looking\r\n  impassable. Whilst we were putting things a little ship-shape—laying\r\n  out wet goods to dry, repairing roads and broken-down huts—Melville\r\n  suddenly looked up and said: ‘Here is our doctor coming down the hill,\r\n  and you may depend he is going to see a poor fellow on the next\r\n  estate, who is dying of dysentery, though I don’t know how he intends\r\n  getting across the stream.’ The sight of Dr. Hardy, who was a general\r\n  favorite, brought everybody down to the banks, where, after a good\r\n  deal of shouting and gesticulation across the foaming river, it was\r\n  made out that Melville’s surmise was correct, and that the doctor\r\n  intended crossing to visit his patient, who was, he feared, dying of\r\n  dysentery, which Melville assured me was only too prevalent in the\r\n  neighborhood; and, after a considerable amount of talking—the whites\r\n  on this side trying to dissuade him from the attempt, as one of the\r\n  most extreme danger, we saw him quietly take off his clothes and hand\r\n  them to his native outrider, who was kneeling down imploring him in\r\n  the most piteous manner not to go; at least so we judged from his\r\n  attitude, and learnt afterward that our surmise was correct. Then,\r\n  having only a thin cotton shirt on, without a moment’s hesitation he\r\n  seized fast hold of the rope, which was trembling and vibrating with\r\n  the force of the current, being in the middle quite under water, and\r\n  commenced his perilous attempt. So long as the rope was out of the\r\n  water he got on fairly; but when he reached the part under water the\r\n  struggle for life began, and a desperate one it was, for on getting a\r\n  little more than half-way his strength suddenly collapsed, and for a\r\n  few seconds he remained quite stationary. Then, suddenly plucking up\r\n  his courage and making one more desperate effort, he succeeded in\r\n  turning over on his back, getting each arm round the rope, with his\r\n  hands clasped over his breast. In this position he remained perfectly\r\n  helpless, unable to make another move. We also observed a sudden\r\n  change of his countenance take place; this, a few seconds before so\r\n  full of daring and confidence was now pale and relaxed, the eyes\r\n  closed, and the lips of a livid hue; his legs and body were entirely\r\n  at the mercy of the water, the arms alone, happily, continuing rigidly\r\n  locked round the rope. It is difficult to describe our feelings as we\r\n  stood watching these outward signs of departing strength. Melville\r\n  began frantically rushing up and down, offering hundreds of rupees to\r\n  any one who would save the doctor, but of the three hundred niggers\r\n  not a man moved. It seemed hard indeed to let a man die like this. So,\r\n  it appears, thought and felt the manager; for, with an exclamation of\r\n  horror, he got on the rope before any one could stop him, and struck\r\n  out for the doctor, whom he very quickly reached, when, speaking a few\r\n  encouraging words, he so far revived him by voice and gesture as to\r\n  get about a yard nearer the shore; but the struggle was so fierce, the\r\n  water so merciless, and the doctor so exhausted, that they could do no\r\n  more, and the manager also found his strength and nerve fail him. Our\r\n  feelings were now doubly intensified; for, instead of one man’s life\r\n  trembling in the balance, there were two. For a short time both seemed\r\n  lost, as, owing to the additional weight and strain upon the rope,\r\n  they were more under water than above, each wave completely covering\r\n  them. Suddenly, without a cry or a kick, the manager threw his hands\r\n  up, and was in a moment carried like a log yards down the stream. Then\r\n  indeed broke out cries and shrieks and yells from men, women, and even\r\n  children, of ‘Save the master! Save the master!’ some in English, some\r\n  in Hindostanee, and some in Kafir; and poor Melville was speechless.\r\n\r\n  “A little lower down the stream was a wide open space, which was\r\n  called the drift, and through which the main road passed when the\r\n  water was low. A general rush now took place there, as the only\r\n  possible chance of picking up the floating body was at this spot. Two\r\n  or three Kafirs of the Basuto tribe waded boldly half-way into this\r\n  boiling torrent, joined hands, and the outside one, by a dextrous leap\r\n  at the right moment, caught the upraised arm of the drowning man\r\n  within a few feet of a mass of rocks and boulders, which must have\r\n  caused instant death, and, amidst the cheers and shouts of all, landed\r\n  him safe. Meanwhile, the doctor still continued clinging with a\r\n  death-like grasp to the rope, it being in fact difficult to judge if\r\n  life remained at all. But now, whether the example set by the manager\r\n  stimulated others, or whether perhaps they felt some little shame,\r\n  several men, headed by the engineer (who could not swim a stroke),\r\n  succeeded in reaching him, and by dint of united efforts they brought\r\n  him to land, also alive, but considerably more like drowned than the\r\n  other. Both men, with the help of brandy and water, lots of rubbing,\r\n  and the other usual remedies, after a time recovered; and in about two\r\n  hours’ time Dr. H. felt able, accompanied by Melville, to go on his\r\n  road to Lime Hill, which they reached only in time to find his patient\r\n  rapidly sinking, and to receive his few last words, for he died that\r\n  same evening before they left the house.”\r\n\r\nOn arriving home next morning, I found a vivid account of my adventure\r\nhad reached the village. My faithful attendant in those days was a young\r\nnative, both of whose arms I had amputated owing to an accident in a\r\nsugar-mill. This lad, seeing me struggling in the torrent, ran away in\r\naffright, making sure I should be drowned, and told my wife and every\r\none he met what he had seen; consequently, on my return I received\r\nhearty congratulations from all sides on my lucky escape.\r\n\r\nYears after, on the diamond fields, many a diamond this honest boy\r\nbrought me when superintending my native servants, the loss of his arms\r\nhaving apparently sharpened his discerning faculties. Poor fellow, at\r\nlast he gave way to that insidious enemy of the native, “Cape smoke,”[1]\r\nwhich, to our eternal disgrace, is sowing destruction and misery\r\nbroadcast among them. One morning he had suddenly disappeared, never to\r\nreturn, but whether murdered or not I never could find out.\r\n\r\nWhile I held the government appointment in Verulam, many curious cases,\r\nfrom a medico-legal point of view, came under my notice. The story of\r\nKongota, the Kafir witch doctor, I have told in another chapter, but I\r\nwill here relate a case which nearly terminated tragically to all\r\nparties concerned, and which occurred on the very same estate that I\r\nhave just mentioned.\r\n\r\nOne fine moonlight night (if I remember rightly, in July, 1869) word was\r\nhurriedly brought to the magistracy that a most shocking murder had been\r\ncommitted and another attempted on the Fenton Vacy sugar estate. As\r\ndistrict surgeon I rode out at once, and on my arrival found all the\r\ncoolies in a terrible state of agitation, gathered in a crowd round a\r\nsmall syringa tree, to which they had securely bound one of their fellow\r\nlaborers, who was pointed out to me as the chief actor in the tragedy\r\nwhich had just been enacted. In a hut close by was the body of the\r\nmurdered man, his brains protruding from gashes in his skull, and in a\r\nhouse adjoining the cause of all could be seen in the person of a young\r\nand pretty coolie girl, with both her ears chopped off, moaning most\r\npitifully.\r\n\r\nAs no investigation could be made that night, everything was left in the\r\ncharge of the police until the morning, when I again, with the\r\nmagistrate, visited the plantation. At the edge of a stream close by I\r\nwas shown the spot where the man’s body had been found, and a large cane\r\nknife, with which the murderous deed had been done, was produced, having\r\nbeen fished up by the coolies from the bed of a rivulet some thirty\r\nyards distant.\r\n\r\nThe theory set up was the following: The man whom I had seen tied to the\r\ntree the night before was known to be madly in love with the murdered\r\nman’s wife, who, however, rejected all his advances; and he, it was\r\nsupposed, out of revenge, had murdered her husband, and then attempted\r\nto murder her—a theory which seemed feasible enough. On going to the\r\ndead man’s house to see his body again before burial, I found all\r\narranged most neatly, the body cold and stiff was laid out in white\r\nclothing; and as the deceased had been a Roman Catholic during life, a\r\nlarge cross of wild flowers was laid on his breast.\r\n\r\nOn looking at the gashes on the skull, of which there were six, through\r\nwhich, as I have already said, the brains were oozing, I was at once\r\nstruck with the fact that they were all parallel, and this at once\r\nraised a doubt in my mind that perchance after all no murder had been\r\ncommitted, as it would have been impossible for these wounds not to have\r\ncrossed one another, if only in a small degree. I ordered the man to be\r\nundressed, his burial robes to be removed, and examined him more\r\nminutely, when I fancied I detected a faint murmur over his heart.\r\nGiving further instructions, I returned again in the evening, and found\r\nthe man actually alive and muttering to himself. To make a long story\r\nshort, he made a most extraordinary recovery. In a few days he was able\r\nto give a lucid account of the whole affair—how, jealous of his wife, he\r\nseized her when grinding chilies, and chopped off her ears; then he\r\ndescribed how he ran to the river’s brink, sat on the stone where he was\r\nfound, and made a desperate attempt, with both hands, cleaver-fashion,\r\nto hack his skull to pieces with the cane knife which had been\r\nrecovered, and which he had spasmodically thrown away. This fully\r\naccounted for the parallel longitudinal gashes, which had led me to\r\ndoubt that a murder had been committed.\r\n\r\nMy fortunate observation virtually saved two lives, as the funeral\r\nprocession standing outside his house was merely waiting my sanction for\r\nthe burial of the body; when in due course of law, on the strength of\r\nthe circumstantial evidence alone, the unfortunate but innocent admirer\r\nof the wife of the would-be suicide would have paid the extreme penalty\r\nof the law for his rash infatuation.\r\n\r\nMy readers may imagine the joy of the suspected murderer when I told\r\nhim, whilst awaiting in the Verulam jail an examination into his case,\r\nthe above facts proving his innocence. This, I may say, he had\r\nthroughout persistently and consistently maintained. The all-important\r\nquestion for him of homicide or suicide was thus luckily and happily\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nAfter practicing for some months in the division I applied for a\r\nconfirmation of the acting appointment, which Gen. Sir J. J. Bisset gave\r\nme in April, 1866.\r\n\r\nI now felt more secure of my position in the county, and as a result\r\ndecided, in conjunction with a clerical friend, to commence a coffee\r\nplantation near Verulam. This progressed very satisfactorily for two\r\nseasons, when my partner, wishing again to join the ministry, from which\r\nfor a time he had retired, we sold off, in order to dissolve our\r\npartnership, the estate we had bought, and on which we had already made\r\nextensive clearings and planted thirty acres of coffee. This did not\r\ndeter me from another attempt at coffee planting, which I was again\r\ndoomed to forsake before the trees got into bearing, as on my return,\r\nafter my trip to India in 1871, I determined to go to the diamond\r\nfields, where I had already, as I mention later, sent a party to dig for\r\nme. I do not wish to dwell on matters which are not of public interest,\r\nyet I cannot help mentioning, _en passant_, that to an accident I owe\r\nthe honor of becoming the son-in-law of one “whose name is still held in\r\nhigh respect in Natal, among British colonists, Boers and Zulus, and who\r\nbelongs indeed to the very first rank of South African missionaries.”[2]\r\nMaking a professional visit to the Inanda Mission Station (American) I\r\nmet my “fate,” and in April, 1867, I married Dr. Lindley’s fifth\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\nDuring the interim which elapsed from my first visit to the Inanda and\r\nmy marriage, I had ample opportunity to observe the interest which Dr.\r\nLindley took in the welfare, both temporal and spiritual, of the\r\nnatives, and the unceasing efforts that he made for their advancement.\r\nThe early work of the American missionaries reads like a novel. I will\r\nhere give a short _resumé_ of their mission to the interior more than\r\nfifty years ago, and the cause of its collapse at that time. The reason\r\nof my introducing this sketch is the general unacquaintance of colonists\r\nwith the first steps of these noble men, these honored pioneers of\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FALLS OF THE UMZINYATI, NEAR INANDA, NATAL\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 3d, 1834, the _Burlington_ left Boston with a party consisting\r\nof six missionaries and their wives, of which the late Dr. Lindley, my\r\nfather-in-law, was one, and arrived safely in Capetown on Feb. 5th,\r\n1835, when three of their number, including Dr. Lindley, started almost\r\nat once for the interior. Seven weeks’ wagon traveling brought them to\r\nGriquatown, where they rested five months, arriving at Kuruman early in\r\n1836. Here Dr. Lindley formed the acquaintance of the late Dr. Moffat,\r\nand received much advice from him as to his future course of action.\r\nLeaving Dr. Wilson behind with the ladies he went forward in company\r\nwith Mr. Venables to Mosega, in Klein Mariko, the headquarters of\r\nMosilikatze, chief of the Matabélé tribe, styled by Moffat the Napoleon\r\nof the desert, whose permission to advance had already been obtained.\r\nThis position, about two hours from Zeerust, in the Transvaal Republic,\r\nwas the place upon which they had fixed to build a station and commence\r\ntheir good work, a French mission having some short time before been\r\nexpelled from the same locality by Mosilikatze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INANDA: THE MISSIONARY STATION OF REV. D. LINDLEY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe district was well chosen, and the spot where they settled, still\r\ncalled Zenderling’s Post (Missionaries’ Post), was situated in a\r\ncharming, well-watered valley, embosomed in the hills in the district of\r\nMarico, near Magaliesberg, in latitude 25°, 27′, longitude 27°, 47′.\r\nHere, on June 15th, 1836, they commenced their labors, which, however,\r\nwere soon to be brought to a tragic end. Mosilikatze did not approve of\r\nthe teaching of the missionaries, which reflected to a certain extent on\r\nhis own actions, forbade his people to listen to them, and himself left\r\nMosega. Still these devoted men and women prayed and hoped that more\r\nfavorable opportunities would arise; for, to add to their misfortunes at\r\nthe time, a fever, obstinate and distressing, laid low many of their\r\nfamilies—caused partly by the climate, and partly by the damp floors of\r\nthe mud houses, which they had hastily built. Yet neither the distrust\r\nor suspicion entertained by Mosilikatze, or the ravages and deaths\r\ncaused by the fever, drove them from the work to which they had devoted\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nI must now go back a few months, and ask my readers to study the\r\nprevious state of affairs. During the winter of 1836, the Dutch in the\r\nCape Colony, disgusted by the treatment, which, in their opinion, they\r\nwere subjected to, and tired of British rule, determined to seek for\r\n“pastures new,” and consequently they made preparations all over the\r\neastern and midland districts to emigrate. Some left for Natal, some\r\ntrekked northward and crossed over the Vaal River, when Mosilikatze,\r\nbecoming jealous of his rights, which had not been consulted, with his\r\nMatabélé warriors nearly annihilated several small parties of Boers,\r\nkilling altogether twenty white men and twenty-six natives, taking away\r\ntheir horses, cattle and sheep. This, as may be imagined, roused a\r\nfeeling of revenge, and as soon as possible a force large enough to\r\npunish Mosilikatze was got together, consisting of 107 farmers, and\r\nnearly the same number of Griquas and Korannas.\r\n\r\nThis organized reprisal left Thaba Nchu on Jan. 3d, 1837, and passing\r\nthrough a country almost depopulated, where scarcely a single man was to\r\nbe seen, came to Mosega on Jan. 17th. All unexpected and unseen, at the\r\nvery earliest dawn, the Boers fell upon the inhabitants of that most\r\nbeautiful valley, and so sudden and so secret was the attack that the\r\nmissionaries were taken as much by surprise as the natives, not knowing\r\nanything until they heard the whistle of the bullets flying around. “The\r\nMatabélé soldiers grasped their spears and shields and rushed forward,\r\nbut volleys of slugs from the long elephant guns of the farmers drove\r\nthem back in confusion. The commanding officer of these natives was\r\naway, and there was no one of sufficient authority to restore order. The\r\nwarriors took to flight, and were hunted by the farmers until the sun\r\nwas high overhead, when it was computed that at least 450 must have been\r\nslain,”[3] shot down on that bloody morn ere the sun could reach the\r\nmeridian. Such a cold-blooded massacre, so one-sided an affair was it,\r\nthat not a single man, either European or native, on the Boer side was\r\ntouched. My wife’s mother has often pictured to me how, lying in bed,\r\nwhere for nine weeks she had been prostrated by rheumatic fever, her\r\nroom was one morning suddenly filled by swarms of wounded, bleeding,\r\nhelpless women and children, imploring her assistance and trying to\r\nescape from the inhuman butchery outside, but to no effect, as they were\r\nremorselessly shot down even at her bedside; in fact, “the outhouse in\r\nwhich their servants slept was literally shot to pieces.”[4] The Boers\r\nhaving set fire to about fifteen villages in the valley, then thought it\r\nadvisable to retire with about 7,000 head of cattle they had found (!)\r\nand as Mary Moffat, writing to her father at the time, said: “Pillaged\r\nthe (missionaries’) house before their eyes, and when they left, the\r\nBoers were still in the house, packing up all their horses could carry.”\r\nOn leaving they urged, even used threats to force, the missionaries to\r\nleave with them, which they did, “submitting to whatever the Boers\r\nwished;” for removed far from civilization, shocked with the bloody\r\nsight just enacted, afraid of their own lives, and convinced that for\r\nyears the introduction of Christianity had been _postponed_, they\r\nthought it the best thing to do. In after years (1859) the fact of the\r\nAmerican Mission leaving Mosega with the conquerors, instead of\r\nremaining with the conquered, was often used by the Matabélé as an\r\nargument against allowing missionaries to again build in the country, as\r\nthey were certain it would only be a matter of time before other white\r\nmen would come, and their land would be taken away from them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lindley was forced from her bed, and with a child in her lap rode\r\nfor twenty-three hours on horseback without stopping. Mr. Grout, in his\r\nwork on Zululand, says: “To their fear of being followed by a host of\r\nexasperated savages, to the unceasing cry of cattle, and to all the\r\ntumult of irregular, excited soldiery, add the want of proper food,\r\nespecially for the sick; the absence of a road, save such as the open\r\nfield affords; the want of a bridge or a boat on the now swollen\r\nstreams; the want of a dry suit for the women and children, who had to\r\nbe floated across the Orange River on a bundle of reeds, keeping only\r\nhead and shoulders above water; then, forthwith out of the river, add a\r\nnight of Egyptian darkness, through all the hours of which no sleep can\r\nbe had, save that which comes in spite of torrents of rain, thunder and\r\nlightning, and all the noise of the motley group by which they are\r\nsurrounded—and you have some idea of what fell to the lot of the\r\nmissionaries, Lindley, Venables, Wilson and their families, on the\r\njourney.”\r\n\r\nIn coming down to the coast, not knowing the passes of the Drakensberg,\r\nthey made a circuit around by Grahamstown of something like 1,500 miles,\r\nand reached Natal at the end of July.[5] This account may read as\r\nfiction in the present day, but it is notwithstanding a “romance in real\r\nlife;” what the early missionaries suffered and endured to propagate the\r\ntruths of divine religion among the heathen in former days, we can now\r\nwith difficulty conceive. Dr. Lindley, on his return from Mosega,\r\nfounded a mission station at Ifumi, at the south side of D’Urban, but\r\nowing to the rupture between Durgaan, the Zulu king, and the Boers,\r\ntogether with the murder of Retief and party, on February 6th, 1838, who\r\nhad gone to ask the Zulu king’s permission to settle on the south side\r\nof the Tugela, the American missionaries considered it prudent to leave\r\nNatal for a time. Dr. Lindley, however, remained behind, but after the\r\nburning of his station at Ifumi, and after experiencing many dangers, he\r\nescaped on board the _Comet_, a little schooner, lying in the D’Urban\r\nharbor, and after first visiting Delagoa Bay, landed at Port Elizabeth\r\non June 22d, 1838. Here he remained twelve months, until peace was\r\nrestored by the complete overthrow of Durgaan, when he returned to\r\nNatal, and commenced, with the approval of his Board, to labor among the\r\nDutch; and was the first to take over the pastoral care of the emigrant\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. John McCarter says: “As pastor he labored amongst the emigrants\r\nfor seven years (1840–1847) having as parish all Natal, together with\r\nthe surrounding territories and the Transvaal Republic. Thousands of\r\nchildren were christened by him; his headquarters were Pietermaritzburg,\r\nWinburg, and Potchefstroom. It was thus that in 1843 the congregations\r\nof Winburg and Pietermaritzburg were amalgamated. Dr. Lindley himself\r\nmentioned to the writer, that at all times and places his words were\r\nlistened to with the greatest concern, and the particular tenderness\r\nwith which after his departure the memory of Lindley was continually\r\nheld in these regions by those who knew him, witness what great good his\r\nlabors brought about.”[6] In 1847 Dr. Lindley resumed his connection\r\nwith the American Board, beginning his work again among the Zulus at the\r\nInanda. In that year he was appointed with Dr. Adams, by the Colonial\r\nauthorities, on a commission to see justice done to the natives, the\r\ninstructions given to them being “that there should not be in the eye of\r\nthe law any distinction or disqualification whatever, founded on mere\r\ndistinction of color, origin, language or creed, but that the protection\r\nof the law, in letter and in substance, shall be extended impartially to\r\nall alike.”\r\n\r\nCarrying out these principles Dr. Lindley worked zealously at the Inanda\r\nfor twelve years, until he visited America in 1859. Returning in 1863,\r\nhe again resumed the duties to which he had devoted so much of his life\r\nand energy. His success at Inanda was great and marked, and after\r\nworking another decade, he returned to America in 1873, and resting from\r\nhis labors, died in 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet me ask my readers to turn to another section of the Christian world,\r\nin which a not altogether unimportant part was played in the little\r\nchurch at Verulam. It will be remembered that I had taken up my abode\r\nwith the Rev. W. A. Elder, the Church of England clergyman, and as it\r\nwas at this time that the excitement over Bishop Colenso and his\r\n“heresies” was at its height, I was in the centre of a very hot-bed of\r\nopposition to him, the worthy vicar being most submissively orthodox.\r\n\r\nAfter Bishop Colenso had published his work on the Pentateuch, which\r\nhorrified the orthodox and excluded the bishop from almost all the\r\nchurch pulpits in England, he returned to the colony in November, 1865,\r\nand visited Verulam. The Rev. W. A. Elder thought fit, sincerely\r\nbelieving he was discharging a religious duty, to oppose his bishop\r\nconducting service in the church on one of his visitation tours, and\r\nthis resulted in a scene, which took place on Sunday morning, Sept.\r\n30th, 1866, not easily to be effaced from the memory of those who beheld\r\nit. As had always been the case when the bishop made his periodical\r\nvisitations, the church was crowded, but even the earliest arrivals that\r\nmorning found the rector waiting in the chancel, which in this simple\r\nbuilding was merely a space railed off from the body of the church by a\r\nlow wooden balustrade. Just before the usual time for the commencement\r\nof the service the bishop came in, walked up the middle aisle, advanced\r\ntoward the chancel, and was about to enter, when Mr. Elder confronted\r\nhim. Standing directly in the way, he read a protest against the bishop\r\ntaking any part in the service, giving his reasons at considerable\r\nlength. The bishop, who had a very commanding presence, stood while the\r\ndocument was being read with unmoved dignity. When it was finished, he\r\nmade no reply, and did not show any consciousness of having even heard\r\nit. He made no sign of assent or dissent, his looks betrayed no emotion,\r\nbut opening the gate of the rude screen he passed inside. For a moment\r\nMr. Elder seemed as if he would stand where he was to block the bishop’s\r\npassage, but happily he made no attempt by physical force to prevent his\r\nentering, and he sat down again at his own side of the Holy Table.\r\n\r\nA few minutes of anxious suspense on the part of the congregation\r\nfollowed, but as the incumbent made no signs of commencing the service,\r\nthe bishop rose from a little covered wooden box on which he had been\r\nsitting, and with his well-toned voice in musical rythm, unshaken by\r\nanger or agitation, read out the text that precedes the Exhortation:\r\n“When the wicked man turneth away from the wickedness that he hath\r\ncommitted, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his\r\nsoul alive.” Mr. Elder then at once left the church, and the bishop\r\nconducted the beautiful offices of Morning Prayer according to the rules\r\nof the Church of England, and delivered a most impressive and beautiful\r\nsermon.\r\n\r\nIt was not until some years after this occurrence that Bishop Colenso’s\r\nlegal position was satisfactorily defined. Some little time after this,\r\nI was chosen one of the church-wardens, and on Mr. Elder’s leaving the\r\ncountry for England, previous to the bishop appointing another incumbent\r\nin his place, I read, in my official capacity, the church prayers to the\r\ncongregation every Sunday morning. In addition to this rather novel\r\nexperience, the government, about this time, during the absence of Dr.\r\nBlaine on leave, appointed me acting resident magistrate; so I acquired,\r\nduring my residence in Natal, a varied experience which has since stood\r\nme in good stead. Everything went on swimmingly for the first few years,\r\nfine seasons, auspicious rains, plentiful crops, good prices, money\r\nplentiful, we had races, balls, concerts, sports, a fine regiment of\r\nmounted volunteers, all wealthy planters; in fact the Victoria County\r\nplanter was renowned through the colony for his geniality and\r\nopen-handed hospitality. Unfortunately, however, at last a wave of\r\ndepression flowed over Natal, the planting interest came almost to its\r\nlast gasp through bad seasons and the usurious rates of interest which\r\nthe planters had to pay for advances against their crops. This, of\r\ncourse, affected me more or less seriously, as no more coolies were\r\nintroduced, the sugar planters not being able to bear the expense, and\r\nthose in the colony at the time by degrees becoming free, and thus\r\nrelieved from compulsory taxation for medical attendance, my income\r\ndiminished in proportion.\r\n\r\nJust at this time (the end of 1870) the discovery of diamonds in\r\nGriqualand West, on the banks of the Vaal River, began to excite\r\nattention, and digging parties to search for these precious stones were\r\nformed both in the Cape Colony and Natal. We quiet folks in Verulam\r\ncaught the fever, which was very contagious, as a proof of which one\r\nmorning after breakfast I had no difficulty in organizing a company to\r\nproceed to the Vaal River, of which Mr. G. I. Lee, afterward chairman of\r\nthe diggers’ committee, Kimberley mining board, and a member of many\r\nscientific societies, consented to take charge. At the same time I sent\r\noff a party on my own account, consisting of three white men and twelve\r\nZulus with wagon, oxen, tools and provisions for six months’\r\nconsumption, intending in a few months to take a trip and see the dry\r\ndiggings myself; but my anticipations of visiting Griqualand West and\r\nthe Vaal were unexpectedly deferred for a year, as, in connection with\r\nthe Natal government, I took the first ship-load of return coolies back\r\nto India. Many a pleasant day-dream this venture gave me during my long\r\nvoyage of the immense fortune awaiting my return, and many a night, too,\r\ndid I dream of Sindbad the Sailor, his second voyage and walk through\r\nthe valley studded with diamonds. How these dreams were rudely broken, I\r\nwill tell in another chapter, but before doing so, will devote a few\r\npages to a description of Zulu customs and the scenery of the colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SCENE IN NATAL—FAMILY GROUP OF ZULUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n      ZULU CUSTOMS.—UKULOBOLA.—UMKOSI.—INTEYEZI.—INSOMYAMA.—KAFIR\r\n  DOCTORS.—FATE OF THE WITCH DOCTOR, KONGOTA, AND HIS VICTIMS.—BISHOP\r\n                     CALLOWAY AND ZULU “FOLK-LORE.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile acting as district surgeon at Verulam under Dr. Blaine’s\r\nmagistracy, my connection with the government, as a matter of course,\r\nenabled me to gain an insight into native customs, with which I should\r\nnot otherwise have had the opportunity of becoming acquainted. I had\r\nfurther the good fortune of being associated in these matters with a\r\ngentleman who thoroughly understood the Kafir language and character,\r\nand whose ability has since been recognized by his promotion to an\r\nimportant magistracy by the Natal government. I allude to Mr. J. C. C.\r\nChadwick, then clerk to the resident magistrate at Verulam, Victoria\r\nCounty. This gentleman published in 1879 some commentaries on native\r\nlaws, customs and usages,[7] which are very interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are many customs among the Zulus of Natal which are known only to\r\nthe natives themselves or to those who have given great study to the\r\nsubject. Some—among others Mr. F. B. Fynney, who now occupies an\r\nimportant official position under the Natal government, but whom I knew\r\nas a sugar planter on the coast—think that the Zulus must have had at\r\none time an intimate connection with the Hebrew nation, as many of their\r\ncustoms are decidedly similar to those practiced by the Jews, to whom\r\npossibly they may have been in bondage in the past ages. Amongst the\r\nusages to which Mr. Fynney draws particular attention in support of this\r\nopinion, is the custom which the maidens follow of proceeding annually\r\nto the hills to mourn or wail, thus reminding one forcibly of Jephthah’s\r\ndaughter. That they have a distinct religious trust, and acknowledge\r\nboth the existence of a supreme being, who created all things, and who\r\nis endowed with infinite power, and that they also believe in another\r\nworld and a hereafter, he has no doubt. One thing is certain—they are\r\nexceptionally superstitious, believe in signs, omens and supernatural\r\nagencies. Nothing, in fact, according to them, happens by chance. They\r\neven offer sacrifices to propitiate a supreme deity, whom not having\r\nseen, they yet believe. Then, too, they have their “lesser gods,” the\r\nspirits of their deceased ancestors; they have their conscience, their\r\nsense of right and wrong, and their laws and customs to regulate their\r\nsocial life. There is no denying the fact that a broad idea of a supreme\r\ndivinity circulates among them, and, as the Right Rev. Henry Calloway,\r\nBishop of St. John’s, who has devoted great study to the subject, says:\r\n“The existence of the religious instincts in the natives, of those germs\r\nof religious truth—which, among Christian people with a divine\r\nrevelation, have been developed into so glorious a religion—is evident\r\nfrom the readiness with which, under proper teaching, they accept the\r\nfact of the creating power continued to be manifested in Providence; and\r\nthat that creating power is our Father in heaven.”\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Lindley as well, after forty years’ experience among the\r\nnatives of South Africa, always expressed to me his belief in the easy\r\nand gradual improvability of the native when not exposed to the\r\ncontaminating influence of the low white colonist, and to the coarse\r\nmaterialism presented to him to copy.\r\n\r\nWhile I was district surgeon the customs of the natives interested me\r\nvery much, and I will mention those which most attracted my notice.\r\n_Ukulobola_, or the practice of giving cattle to the father or guardian\r\nof a girl or widow, on her marriage, by her husband, is one of the\r\noldest laws among the natives of South Africa. Looking at the practice\r\nfrom an Englishman’s point of view, it is tantamount to the purchase and\r\nsale of women, but it does not bear the same construction in the native\r\nmind, for it is by them considered as compensation for the loss of a\r\ndaughter’s services at an age when, by her usefulness and affection, she\r\nmight give some return for the care and attention which she received in\r\nchildhood. Moreover, the girl glories in it as a proof of her worth,\r\nwhile the man himself would not value a wife who cost nothing. The\r\nintended son-in-law, when engaged to a girl, generally begins to pay the\r\nnecessary cattle in instalments, and as he has to run the risk of their\r\ndying, their sickness and death very often delay the marriage. If an\r\nengagement is broken off the suitor gets back all the cattle he may have\r\npaid on account; again, if a wife die without issue the husband can\r\nclaim the cattle he has paid, or the father must give him another girl\r\ninstead; but if the husband die while the wife is still young, a younger\r\nbrother takes the wife, or she returns home, and the husband’s estate\r\nreceives back the cattle, supposing the wife has borne no children.\r\n\r\nTheir law of inheritance is a study in itself. A Natal Kafir looks upon\r\nany money or goods he may acquire as valuable only as a means of\r\nacquiring cattle, by possession of which he may obtain wives. Land they\r\ndo not claim individually, and they set value on it only as the common\r\nright of their tribe. The head man of a _kraal_ is a patriarch indeed,\r\nand is responsible for the good behavior of the members of it. If he has\r\na son who is married, that son cannot, during his father’s lifetime, say\r\nwhich of his wives shall be his _Ikohlo_ (right-hand wife), or which his\r\n_Iquadi_ (left-hand wife), but his father, after due consideration,\r\nchooses them for him, and when once appointed neither their position nor\r\nthat of their children can be altered, however badly they may behave.\r\nThe _Inkosikazi_ is the wife of the greatest rank, her hut is placed in\r\nthe centre opposite the gateway of the kraal, and her eldest son is\r\nheir. The hut of the right-hand wife is placed to the right side, that\r\nof the left-hand wife to the left of that of the “inkosikazi,” and of\r\ncourse they occupy the next position to that of the chief wife. If male\r\nissue fail the chief wife, the eldest son of the “ikohlo,” or right-hand\r\nwife, can only succeed to the chieftainship in event of male issue\r\nfailing all the wives of the left-hand side. The head of the kraal is\r\nentitled to receive all the earnings of his sons or daughters, but he is\r\nexpected to start his sons in life, or in other words, to find their\r\nmarriage portion. The following diagram shows the position of the chief\r\nhuts in a kraal:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGenerally when the head of a kraal dies, the heir leaves the kraal to\r\nthe chief wife and to the “iquadi,” his younger brothers remaining, and\r\nif any of his father’s widows are young enough, his uncles or some other\r\nman is appointed to raise up seed to his (the heir’s) house. This custom\r\nis called _Ukungena_, but is now modified by allowing the widow, if she\r\nchooses, to marry some other man; if so, however, the new husband must\r\npay a marriage consideration to the estate of the deceased husband.\r\n\r\nThe chase, too, has its rules, as also has the _Umkosi_, or dance of\r\nfirst fruits, a festival before the celebration of which, at the chief’s\r\nkraal, the first fruits of the season cannot be eaten. A large bull is\r\nkilled by the young warriors of the tribe, which is skinned, cut up, and\r\ncooked, when the doctors first eat a portion, and then the chief does\r\nlikewise, but in doing so spits out some in the direction of the country\r\nof each of his enemies, or rather of each independent government\r\nsituated around him; for instance, Cetywayo, the King of the Zulus, used\r\nto spit toward Natal, the Transvaal, and the Swazi country, and utter\r\nthe names of the Governor of Natal, the Administrator of the Transvaal,\r\nand the King of the Swazies, a custom equivalent to our drinking\r\nconfusion to all the Queen’s enemies and singing:\r\n\r\n                    “Confound their politics,\r\n                    Frustrate their knavish tricks.”\r\n\r\nThe flesh after this is all cut up, thrown into the air, and all the\r\nmen, like hungry dogs, scramble to catch the pieces.\r\n\r\nNext day the chief and all the men of the tribe dance in the kraal,\r\nwhen, adjourning to a neighboring stream, the chief bathes, the ceremony\r\nof “Umkosi” is finished, and the tribe can partake of the first fruits\r\nof the season.\r\n\r\nI may also mention the _Inteyezi_, or the sprinkling of warriors with a\r\ndecoction of herbs and roots to make them fierce and brave, the eating\r\nof _Insomyama_, or the choicest meat, which, being consumed only in the\r\nhouse of the head of the family, at once establishes the superiority of\r\nthe house, and consequently is very important evidence in trying cases\r\nof disputed inheritance. Then again there is the penalty of damages in\r\nthe shape of an ox, which every man must pay who applies to another the\r\ndefamatory term _Umtagati_[8] or to a girl of _Isiropo_,[9] and,\r\nfurther, there is the difference between the English and native laws of\r\nevidence, which, as I am not a lawyer, I will discreetly pass over.\r\n\r\nThe intimate acquaintance I made, however, with the customs of the\r\nnative doctors (I suppose on account of its connection with my own\r\nprofession) many a time afforded me food for contemplation and\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nIt may not be out of the way here for me to mention the different\r\nrecognized kinds of doctors (_izinyanga_): 1st, the wizard or diviner\r\n(_inyanga gokubula_); 2d, the rain doctor; 3d, the lightning and hail\r\ndoctor; 4th, the medicine doctor (_inyanga yokwelapa_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ZULU “MASHERS.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wizard or witch doctor is a very cunning, shrewd fellow, and he must\r\nalso be a doctor of medicine. The profession is not, however, confined\r\nto the male sex, for as many women as men are engaged in its mysteries;\r\nbut to describe how the patients are gulled, and how the very secrets\r\nabout which they consult the doctor he manages to ascertain from\r\nthemselves, in what a professional manner they are duped, and how the\r\ndoctor’s riches and reputation increase, would take up too much time.\r\nRain doctors are supposed to have the power of causing rain to fall, and\r\nare appealed to after a long drought, but they are clever enough never\r\nto commence their incantations until indications of rain are\r\ndiscernible, and consequently they are always sure of success. Next come\r\nthe lightning doctors, who dance around the kraals they have been\r\nsummoned to defend, brandishing their _assegais_ during the flashes and\r\nviolence of the storm in a manner that suggests insanity to the European\r\nobserver. Naturally they are more frequently successful than\r\nunsuccessful. The hail doctors, again, believe that by burning medicine\r\nwhile the hail is yet distant they diminish its power, and that when\r\nthey leave their huts to command it to depart it will return whence it\r\ncame. It must be understood that these doctors are not to be regarded as\r\nopponents of the heavens, but simply as mediators. Bishop Calloway says\r\nthat many heathen have asked him to pray for rain, because he was one\r\nwhose office it was _Ukumelana nenkosi_—to contend with God—and who was\r\nunder the protection of heaven, and safe so long as he was observant of\r\nthe laws of his office. Last, but not least, is the medicine doctor.\r\nSickness, the natives believe, is always caused by an enemy, or by the\r\nwill of the spirits of their departed ancestors or relatives who\r\ngenerally protect them from harm, but, who being sometimes angry, allow\r\nsickness to overtake them, or the machinations of their enemies to\r\nprevail. The doctor’s father and grandfather have generally been in the\r\nprofession before him, and the secrets of the healing art have thus been\r\nhanded down from generation to generation, though in some instances he\r\nis a self-taught man, who has picked up some knowledge of diseases,\r\nroots and herbs by observation and experience; but no faith, whatever,\r\nis reposed in a doctor or diviner who happens to be fat. The medicines\r\nemployed are mostly innocent, but still many powerful drugs are included\r\nin their pharmacopœia, for instance, they use the male fern\r\n(_inkomankoma, lastred felix mas_) as a remedy for tape-worm, emetics by\r\nthe gallon for slight ailments, and as correctives after their\r\nbeer-drinking orgies, other medicaments so powerful that whole families,\r\nboth black and white, have been carried off by their felonious\r\nadministration; but their useful medicines are so mixed up with useless\r\nadulterations that in most cases it would be better for the patient to\r\n“throw physic to the dogs.” It used to be the case of “no cure, no pay;”\r\nfor, according to their law, if the patients died, or did not recover\r\nuntil another medical man had been called in, the doctor got no payment;\r\nbut in Natal, now, on first attendance the doctor requires a preliminary\r\nfee of ten shillings, nominally to buy medicine, but at the same time he\r\nstipulates for receiving a bullock in case of a cure being effected. As\r\na rule they administer harmless drugs, thinking it safest to believe in\r\nthe motto of “vis medicatrix naturæ,” for there is no doubt the majority\r\nare the most arrant quacks ever known. Some, who rank high in the\r\nprofession, travel from place to place, and as the result of their skill\r\nand knowledge of human nature, return home after an absence of months,\r\nor it may be years, rich in the possession of large herds of cattle. The\r\ndoctor of medicine is also often a witch doctor, and so combines in one\r\na knowledge of the two branches of the profession.\r\n\r\nA case[10] occurred toward the end of 1866, in which I was engaged as\r\ngovernment surgeon, which at the time created an immense sensation in\r\nNatal. It elucidates what I have just said of witch and medicine\r\ndoctoring being often combined. I think the story of the tragedy will\r\nnot be uninteresting to my readers.\r\n\r\nInformation was brought to the resident magistrate’s court at Verulam\r\nthat a native had been severely assaulted in a location some miles away,\r\nand I was ordered by the resident magistrate, together with the clerk of\r\nthe court, to proceed to the wounded man’s kraal and investigate the\r\nmatter. Our path to the kraal, the home of the dying man, led through\r\nthe passes of one of the wildest, most rugged and most picturesque\r\nregions to be found in the whole of Natal. Here, owing to the proximity\r\nof the sea, we found the vegetation clothing the rocky defile to be most\r\nluxuriantly dense and tropical. Tramping along the narrow Kafir path in\r\norder to reach our destination, we had to push aside fantastic wreaths\r\nof tangled convolvuli, force our way past festoons of monkey rope\r\nparasites and other climbers, and whilst avoiding the wild date tree on\r\nthe one hand, had on the other to shun the prickly thorns of the\r\ncrimson-fruited _amatungulu_. Our tardy progress scared the barking\r\nbaboon in his rocky home, startled the chattering monkey from his lofty\r\nperch and the timid buck from his grassy lair, whilst the\r\nbrilliant-plumaged _uqualaquala_ and other feathered denizens of the\r\nbush flew away, alarmed at our approach. To describe the lovely,\r\never-changing scenery which broke upon our view is almost impossible;\r\nthe majestic milk wood, the deadly _euphorbia_, the quaint Kafir boom,\r\nthe spreading fan-palm, the aloe, cactus and wild banana, all lending\r\ntheir presence to produce an effect not easily to be effaced. Woe betide\r\nus, however, if we did not keep a sharp lookout for the deadly snakes\r\ncoiled in the long grass at our feet, or for those which, hanging like\r\ngreen tendrils from the trees above, were ever ready to drop upon our\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival we found the man reported as seriously assaulted, whose\r\nname, by the way, was Umjaba, sitting quietly smoking _bhang_ at the\r\ngate of his kraal, with a blanket round his shoulders, seemingly\r\nastonished at the excitement that he was creating.\r\n\r\nOn my asking him, through the court interpreter who accompanied us, what\r\nwas the matter, he denied that any assault whatever had been committed\r\non him, and as he neither showed me nor could I see any marks on his\r\nperson, we returned to Verulam.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, news was brought to the magistracy that he was\r\ndead, and I was again ordered out to examine the body and report upon\r\nthe circumstances. The facts which I gathered were as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo months before, somewhere about the end of the year 1866, a native\r\ndoctor of the Amatonga tribe named Kongota, accompanied by a young\r\nnative who carried his pack of medicines and charms, came to the kraal\r\nof an elderly native named Nokahlela, who resided in the Inanda\r\ndivision, not far from Verulam.\r\n\r\nAs is customary amongst natives, the doctor was well received and\r\nhospitably entertained by Nokahlela and his family, which consisted of\r\nseveral wives and children of all ages, from infants in arms to grown up\r\nsons and daughters.\r\n\r\nIt happened that shortly before the arrival of the doctor there had been\r\na death in the family of one of the wives of either the head of the\r\nkraal or one of his sons. As is usual amongst the natives, the death was\r\nof course not attributed to natural causes, but was firmly believed to\r\nbe attributable to the sorceries of some evil-disposed person, as I have\r\nmentioned above, generally termed an _Umtagati_, and Nokahlela and his\r\nfamily had some slight suspicion of a neighbor of theirs named Umjaba,\r\nwith whom they had had some disagreement. All these facts and suspicions\r\nthe wily doctor soon succeeded in finding out, and determined to turn to\r\nhis own advantage.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a child of Umjaba’s sickened and died, and the doctor,\r\nKongota, who, if I recollect aright, had been called in to attend this\r\nchild, ascertained that Umjaba was quite ready to suspect his neighbor\r\nNokahlela of having brought about the infant’s death, and he therefore\r\nmade it his business to encourage the suspicion. When he found that the\r\nsuspicions he had encouraged were sufficiently strong, he boldly told\r\nUmjaba that they were well founded; in fact, that by the practice of his\r\nart and the power that he possessed of holding familiar intercourse with\r\nthe spirits of the departed he had ascertained that it was an absolute\r\nfact that the child’s death was caused by the witchcraft of Nokahlela,\r\nand that if he wished to be revenged for the murder of his child he,\r\nKongota, for a consideration could make that revenge easy to him. Having\r\nthus “sown the good seed,” he departed and returned to Nokahlela’s\r\nkraal.\r\n\r\nKongota then proceeded to fan Nokahlela’s suspicions as to the cause of\r\nthe death of his wife, until he succeeded in convincing him that the\r\ndeath was caused by Umjaba, and having done so, he confirmed Nokahlela’s\r\nbelief in the same manner as he had that of Umjaba. The two men were now\r\nboth in the mood in which the doctor wished them to be—ready to\r\nundertake almost anything that promised revenge for the supposed\r\ninjuries which each firmly believed that he had suffered at the hands of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFor the consideration of a fine young cow, Kongota promised to procure\r\nfor Nokahlela the most complete satisfaction. Let us see how he\r\nfulfilled his promise. According to primitive native law, an “Umtagati”\r\ncaught in the act of placing, during the night-time, at his intended\r\nvictim’s kraal, charms or medicines with the supposed object of causing\r\ndeath or injury, could be seized and killed in the most cruel manner,\r\nviz., by being pierced with sharp-pointed sticks, without even the form\r\nof a trial. It was the gratification of treating his enemy in this\r\nmanner that Kongota promised to Nokahlela.\r\n\r\nIn furtherance of his plan, he now returned to Umjaba and sold him for a\r\nhead of cattle what he assured him was a most deadly charm. It looked\r\nlike fine, bright gunpowder, and was in reality the seed of the wild\r\nspinach, and perfectly harmless. This he told him he had only to\r\nsprinkle at the door of each hut of his enemy in such a manner that no\r\none could leave the huts without passing over it, and the death of every\r\none of the inmates would result. Umjaba hesitated for some time, as he\r\nwas afraid that he might be detected before he had effected his purpose,\r\nbut on Kongota offering to accompany him on the midnight expedition he\r\nagreed to undertake it. The time was fixed and Kongota left him in\r\norder, as he said, to prepare the way for him to carry out his design.\r\nOn the night following he promised to call for him and accompany him on\r\nhis errand of mercy!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AMACI KAFIR DANCE.—ALFRED COUNTY, NATAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe doctor had now only to instruct his friend Nokahlela to receive his\r\nnocturnal visitor, and then to reap his reward. This was soon done;\r\nNokahlela made the necessary preparations for giving Umjaba a proper and\r\nfitting reception, and the doctor returned to the kraal of his dupe at\r\nthe appointed time. They were to start together about midnight. When the\r\nhour approached, Umjaba, who felt rather uneasy about the possible\r\nconsequences of the enterprise, armed himself with an assegai and a\r\nknobkerrie, that he might be able to defend himself in case of\r\nnecessity; but the doctor, not approving of these warlike preparations,\r\nand thinking no doubt that he might receive a stray thrust or blow\r\nhimself when his treachery was discovered, assured him that such\r\nprecautions were utterly needless, as he had so charmed the kraal that\r\nall its inmates were wrapped in the profoundest slumber, that not a dog\r\nwould bark, or a cat mew, and stated, moreover, that it was contrary to\r\nall precedent to carry weapons when engaged on such an undertaking. Thus\r\nreassured, and seeing that the doctor carried no weapon, Umjaba sallied\r\nforth to his doom, preceded by his treacherous adviser. On arriving at\r\nthe gate of the kraal the doctor entered first, and observing the young\r\nmen of Nokahlela’s kraal lying on each side of the entrance, ready to\r\nseize upon their victim, he whispered to them that Umjaba was following\r\nhim unarmed, and hurried on to a hut at the further side of the\r\ninclosure, which he quickly entered, and wherein he took care to remain\r\nuntil after the tragedy so soon to be enacted outside should be\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nUmjaba had no sooner entered than he was seized and secured by Nokahlela\r\nand his sons (six in all) who took him outside the gate, and at once\r\ninflicted on him the usual punishment awarded to _abatagati_, driving\r\nthe pointed sticks right up into his bowels. He was then carried back\r\nand placed on the ground near his own kraal, where he was found the next\r\nmorning by his family. As I have said, information was given to the\r\nauthorities, and according to instruction I made my first visit to the\r\nspot early next day, where we found Umjaba apparently quite sensible,\r\nbut who obstinately refused to give any information that would throw any\r\nlight upon the matter. On my second visit, as I have already mentioned,\r\nI found the hapless Umjaba a corpse. On making a post-mortem examination\r\nI discovered and removed three pointed sticks, each at least a foot in\r\nlength, which had been driven through the lower part of his body, right\r\ninto the bowels, out of view, and the agony of which, although it must\r\nhave been almost insufferable, he had possessed the stoicism to conceal.\r\nSuspicion, however, fell upon the family of Nokahlela, and they were all\r\narrested, together with the doctor, Kongota; when the servant of the\r\ndoctor, who had himself taken no part in the affair, gave information\r\nagainst the others, which resulted in the conviction of Nokahlela, his\r\nfive sons, and last, but not least, doctor Kongota himself, and they\r\nwere all sentenced to death. The doctor, Nokahlela and his eldest son\r\nwere hanged, and the others were imprisoned for a long term of years,\r\nthe sentences of death passed upon them being commuted by the governor.\r\n\r\nThere was for a long time great difficulty in getting evidence in this\r\ncase. This was caused by the doctor having administered a dose of the\r\nalready-mentioned spinach seed to every one in Nokahlela’s kraal who\r\nknew anything about the matter, telling them after they had swallowed\r\nthe medicine that if ever they opened their mouths to say anything to\r\nany of the authorities concerning what they knew, they would surely that\r\nmoment die. This kept them all quiet for a long while, until the\r\ndoctor’s servant, who perhaps from his familiarity with the doctor had\r\nless faith in the potency of his medicines, told the _Induna_[11] of the\r\nmagistrate’s court that he would tell if he were not afraid of dying.\r\nN-capai, the “induna,” assured him that he had nothing to fear from the\r\ndoctor’s medicine, though he had everything to fear from the law if he\r\nconcealed from the authorities anything with which he ought to acquaint\r\nthem. He then made a clean breast of everything, and thus revealed the\r\nwhole plot.\r\n\r\nUmjaba, though he lived more than thirty hours after receiving these\r\ndreadful injuries, maintained silence to the last upon the whole matter.\r\nI suppose he considered that he had been rightly served for what he had\r\nattempted to do, and that there was no use in saying anything about the\r\naffair; but it always seemed to me a pity that Nokahlela and his eldest\r\nson suffered the extreme penalty of the law, as they were simply dupes\r\nin the hands of the doctor, and acted according to Kafir custom. The\r\ndoctor justly met his fate.\r\n\r\nThis story in “real life” illustrates the power which witchcraft still\r\nexercises among the natives, and the vast field that yet lies open for\r\nthe teaching of the missionary and the civilizing power of the white\r\nman.\r\n\r\nDuring the six years I was in the Natal government service I had many\r\nother opportunities afforded me of observing the effects of native\r\ncustoms; but I will not tire my readers with more of these stories, as\r\nthey serve but to further illustrate the effects of superstition\r\ningrafted on ignorance.\r\n\r\nBishop Calloway, the greatest authority now living on the Zulu language,\r\ntwenty years ago interested himself in collecting the “folk-lore”\r\ncurrent among the Zulus, and endeavored to save from oblivion the\r\npopular traditions, religious legends and superstitions of that people,\r\nand “not to leave our children,” as he says, “to mourn, as our ancestors\r\nhave left us, that the people have died away and the language become\r\nconfined to a few mountain fastnesses or a few old men and women before\r\nwe have gathered up what might be known of their past.” His collection\r\nof nursery tales (_Izniganekwane_) and the tradition of creation\r\n(_Ukulunkulu_) are exceedingly interesting to any student of “folk-lore”\r\nliterature, the precision and exactness of the language showing that the\r\nZulu is the highly elaborated language of a people at once\r\nsuperstitious, grave and clever, pastoral and agricultural; and also\r\nthat the language is one in which thoughts and ideas on any subject can\r\nbe clearly expressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n TRIP TO THE TUGELA.—MARITZBURG.—BISHOP COLENSO.—UMGENI FALLS.—ESTCOURT\r\nLIDGETTON.—CURIOUS ABSENCE OF FISH IN MOOI RIVER.—CAPT. ALLISON’S BORDER\r\n  RESIDENCY.—USIDINANE’S CANNIBAL CAVES.— MONT AUX SOURCES.—UMBUNDI’S\r\n                         PASS.—RETURN JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter five years’ work without any intermission, I made arrangements\r\nearly in 1870 to take a trip up country as far as the Drakensberg, a\r\nrange of mountains which divides Natal from the Free State and\r\nBasutoland. I proposed to visit Captain Allison “at home” in his border\r\nresidency, to see the celebrated falls, where I had been told the\r\nTugela, rushing over awe-inspiring and romantic precipices, leaps 1,500\r\nfeet at a bound, then to visit the Mont aux sources, where from one\r\nsingle spot the Tugela issues forth on its course to Natal, the Elands\r\nRiver to the Free State, the Caledon to Basutoland, and the Orange River\r\nthrough the Cape Colony to the Atlantic Ocean; and further to explore\r\nthe cannibal caves of Usidinane, situated in the heart of Putini’s tribe\r\nand Langalibalela’s location.\r\n\r\nMy wife, myself, Captain Hill, of the Victoria mounted rifles, an\r\namateur photographer and four natives formed our party. Getting the\r\nwagons, oxen and provisions all in readiness, we left Verulam on March\r\n3d.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UMZABA’S KRAAL, 1867.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe country between D’Urban and Maritzburg, the capital of the Natal\r\ncolony, ascends gradually from the sea level to an elevation of over\r\n2,000 feet, sometimes in gentle slopes, sometimes in abrupt and rugged\r\nsteps. Our road lay through the village of Pinetown, a noted health\r\nresort, round the cuttings of that precipitous height called Bothas\r\nHill, which afforded glimpses in the far distance of the fantastic\r\nmountains, with their volcanic cones and extinct craters, of the Inanda\r\nlocation, and the gloomy defiles through which the Umgeni River could be\r\nseen twisting and winding. Then passing the Inchanga cutting, with huge\r\nblocks of granite hundreds of tons in weight studding the foreground,\r\nand Camperdown, a hamlet consisting of two or three homesteads and a\r\nthird-rate roadside inn, we at last reached Maritzburg, some fifty miles\r\nfrom the coast. Here we remained over Sunday, and of course went to the\r\ncathedral and heard Bishop Colenso preach. The sacred edifice was\r\ncrowded, as we were told it always was when this revered prelate\r\noccupied the pulpit; and I may here say that his noble and commanding\r\npresence, an attraction in itself, added greatly to the fascination of\r\nhis eloquence. The sermon that the bishop gave us on the morning on\r\nwhich I heard him dealt with the trials and sufferings of Christ. In\r\nvain I looked out for heretical doctrines, but seldom has it been my\r\nprivilege to listen to a sermon so devout in spirit and withal so\r\northodox.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult indeed, seeing and hearing him, to realize the\r\nopposition with which he was then meeting, or to comprehend the\r\npresumption, I might say the gnarling, that characterized the majority\r\nof his revilers.\r\n\r\nWhile walking round the city I noticed that everything looked clean and\r\ncheerful. The streams of water running in open sluits along the side of\r\nthe foot-paths, the clusters of weeping willows, the rows of stately\r\nsyringas, and the pretty villas nestling in clumps of the densest\r\nfoliage, conveyed the impression of ease and comfort. I also visited the\r\nvarious public buildings, including the banks, schools, library and\r\nhospital. On my last evening in Maritzburg, spending a few hours at the\r\nVictoria club, I met Judge Phillips (subsequently promoted to a similar\r\njudicial office in Cyprus), who, when talking over the route which I\r\nintended to take, told me that after reaching the summit of the\r\nDrakensberg and visiting the falls of the Tugela, I ought to come down\r\nagain into Natal through a pass named after a certain chief Umbundi,\r\n“where,” he said, “you will have, if my information be correct, to pick\r\nyour way through a forest of magnificent cypress trees such as you have\r\nnever before seen.” I thanked him at the time for his information, and\r\noften since have I been glad that I took the judge’s suggested route,\r\nwhere, as he told me I should and as will be seen later, I found one of\r\nthe grandest and most novel sights in South Africa. Next day, we left\r\nMaritzburg and ascended the Town Hill. Here we noticed the terraced\r\ncharacter of the country, for this road rising step by step, at least\r\n1,500 feet, landed us fairly on the plateau which forms the midland\r\ndistricts of Natal, where the long, rolling, grassy sweeps are the\r\nprincipal features of the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe cracks of the long whip, the shouts of the driver, the regular times\r\nto outspan and inspan, to eat and sleep, are the only events to break\r\nthe monotony of a wagon journey. The power of the trusty wagon whip,\r\nwith its crack so “loud and sharp,” has so bewitchingly been sung by Mr.\r\nCharles Barter, one of Natal’s oldest colonists, that I need not offer\r\nany excuse for reproducing it here. Many a time, to the tune of the\r\n“Fine old English Gentleman,” have I listened to the lay.\r\n\r\n Britannia’s three great colonies, though children of one mother,\r\n Yet each in habits as in soil, must differ from the other,\r\n And each some symbol vaunts to show—the rapture of her soil,\r\n A humble household symbol of her settlers’ honest toil.\r\n So we along the Southern Coast, let none who hear deride,\r\n Will sing our trusty wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide,\r\n Will sing our trusty wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide.\r\n\r\n Through many a dreary wilderness, o’er many a barren moor,\r\n From Western Cape to fair Natal first trekked the stalwart Boer,\r\n His was the white-capt wagon, his was the steady team,\r\n And he cut the lash from the reeking hide of the sea-cow by the stream.\r\n And the savage quaked when first he heard up steep Quathlamba’s side,\r\n The crack of our dreaded wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide,\r\n The crack of our dreaded wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide.\r\n\r\n The Australian boasts his stock-whip stout, with which in mad career\r\n He urges o’er the boundless plain the wild unbroken steer,\r\n Or drives his herds to pastures new in swift and headlong flight,\r\n Down many a stony torrent bed, o’er many a rocky height.\r\n\r\n But though loud and sharp its cracks resound adown the mountain’s side,\r\n Yet it cannot match our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide,\r\n Yet it cannot match our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide.\r\n\r\n By Canada’s backwoodsman aye the narrow axe is borne,\r\n Fit emblem of his wooded home—no theme for jest or scorn,\r\n Right well her darksome forests know the sway of its fateful stroke,\r\n As in answering crash comes thundering down tall pine or stately oak.\r\n We may not scorn the narrow axe, the bold backwoodsman’s pride,\r\n But we’ll shout ha! ha! for our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow\r\n    hide,\r\n But we’ll shout ha! ha! for our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow\r\n    hide.\r\n\r\n Then here’s to the tree our gardens yield, the tapering light bamboo,\r\n And here’s to the hand that can wield it well, gin his heart be leal and\r\n    true,\r\n And here’s to the slow and steady team that all the livelong day,\r\n Through rough and smooth, with even pace, still plod their onward way,\r\n And here’s to the Vorslacht’s clap, which wakes the echoes far and wide.\r\n Then hurrah! hurrah! for our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cow hide,\r\n Then hurrah! hurrah! for our wagon whip, with its lash of sea-cowhide.\r\n\r\nBut the rest from work did us all good. About thirteen miles from\r\nMaritzburg we made a halt in order to see the beautiful falls of the\r\nUmgeni, which are close to the drift where we crossed. The river here\r\nhas worn its way through piles of columnar basalt to the edge of an\r\nawful precipice, where in one terrific leap of 372 feet it has for\r\ncountless ages fallen into the broad, deep pool below, the encircling\r\nrocks around being clothed with trees, exotic ferns and flowers both\r\nbeautiful and rare. Many a tale was told us of “moving accidents by\r\nflood and field,” of the sudden, tumultuous rush of waters when a flood\r\ncame down, of belated wayfarers and of rash unfortunates washed over\r\ninto the abyss. Leaving the pretty village adjacent to the falls, with\r\nits church and wayside inn, reminding one of old England, we went on,\r\nstill ascending, another 1,600 feet to the Karkloof. I must not forget\r\nto mention that a few miles before we came to this range we passed\r\nLidgetton, where the early settlers under the Burns’ scheme were first\r\nlocated. Here our attention was drawn to the gentle puffs of smoke\r\nlazily curling up from the steam mills working away in the forest,\r\nwhere, almost unseen by mortal eye, they were turning out the timber\r\nfrom which the colony obtains most of its best wagon material.\r\n\r\nTrekking slowly, we crossed the Bushman River, the natives, seeing our\r\nwagons from a distance, bringing chickens, marrows, pumpkins, and milk\r\nfor sale, until we came to the village of Estcourt, prettily situated on\r\nits banks, where I enjoyed a nice plunge in the river, which here purls\r\nover a pebbly bottom in a clear and crystal stream. Curiously enough,\r\nthe Mooi River, a few miles nearer the Drakensberg, is shunned by any\r\nspecies of fish for miles, while in this river they abound. Here we were\r\nawakened one night, having outspanned late, by the noise as of dogs\r\nlicking out the pots under our wagon, but as we had no dogs with us, we\r\ncould not make it out, until our natives next morning, from foot-prints\r\nthey saw, told us that hyenas had been prowling all round us, which was\r\nin this part of Natal a matter of unusual occurrence.\r\n\r\nPushing on, our next stage was Colenso, where the Tugela, beginning to\r\nassume grand proportions, courses swiftly to the sea; here, leaving the\r\nmain road, we turned to the left, and trekking thirty miles further\r\nalong a by-road but little used, came at last to the picturesque cottage\r\nwhere Captain Allison was living, seven miles from the spot where the\r\nTugela falls over the perpendicular face of the berg. After cordial\r\ngreetings we rested for the night, being most kindly entertained by Mrs.\r\nAllison and her daughters. The place seemed an “oasis in the desert,”\r\nfor here, far away from the civilized world, we suddenly found ourselves\r\nin the midst of a circle as highly cultured as they were truly\r\nhospitable. While fully acquainted, out of the world as their residence\r\nmight seem, with the latest sensations in literature, and doings of the\r\nfashionable world in European capitals, our delightful host and hostess\r\nhad not neglected the study of the zoology of the colony, as their small\r\nbut carefully selected menagerie of cranes, mahens, quaggas, baboons,\r\netc., was sufficient to prove. Next day, with native police and horses\r\nwhich our host had kindly provided, off we started before the sun was\r\nhot to visit the Cannibal caves of Usidinane. I recollect, even now,\r\nwhat a merry party we were that morning, and how we made the mountains\r\nring with our joyous shouts and mirth. Our guides, infected with our\r\nexuberant spirits, chanted a war-song as they marched jauntily along in\r\nsingle file leading the way, while we, riding behind, followed them by a\r\nKafir path which led over broken ridges up the steep, water-worn side of\r\na rugged mountain. After climbing some frightful ledges on its face, we\r\nsuddenly found ourselves in front of the entrance to the Cannibal caves\r\nof the once so-much-talked-of Usidinane. This man, now a petty chief,\r\nthough formerly not possessing any tribal rights, used some sixty years\r\nago to live in these caves with his father and other natives, who, as\r\nwell as himself, were driven by starvation to become cannibals when the\r\ncountry was overrun by the _impis_ and invading legions of the Zulu\r\nking, Chaka, and the war-cries of that despot’s braves reverberated\r\nthrough the mountains. Usidinane is still living, at an advanced age, in\r\ncharge of a few descendants of these cannibals, who, when Natal became\r\ntranquilized, came forth from the shelter they had sought, and occupied\r\nground in the immediate vicinity, and are now called by the tribal name\r\nof Amazizi. Off-saddling on our arrival at the caves, before we\r\ncommenced our exploration, we greedily set to work and ate up all the\r\nprovisions we had brought, the keen mountain air having made us\r\nravenously hungry.\r\n\r\nMy wife, though an excellent horsewoman, was greatly fatigued, so we\r\ndetermined, the day being far spent before our examination of the\r\ncaverns was finished, to remain all night in them and return next\r\nmorning. With the caves themselves I was rather disappointed, as they\r\nwere merely like huge lime quarries scooped out in the rocks, yet\r\nevidence was not wanting of their having been tenanted by human beings,\r\nthe charred ceilings and the vestiges of fire and bone-ash being\r\ndistinctly to be seen in their gloomy recesses. It is to my mind an\r\ninteresting fact that human flesh is never anywhere chosen by man from a\r\nsense of preference—either necessity, not depravity, compels—or revenge,\r\nnot appetite, prompts its use. Some savages consume human flesh as a\r\nsacred rite, a part of their religion in honor of the dead, some as a\r\nsentiment of affection, and others again with the idea that principles\r\nsuch as courage and honor are conveyed from the dead to the living.[12]\r\n\r\nColonel Bowker, whose name is so honorably associated with Basutoland,\r\nin an article communicated to the _Cape Monthly_, in 1869, describing a\r\nvisit to the Putiasana Caves, in that country, says: “There was but\r\nlittle disguising it [cannibalism], and the people when questioned spoke\r\nfreely of it, as first a necessity and then a choice,” but this I think\r\nwas simply native braggadocio. Charles Waterton, in his “Natural History\r\nEssays,” bears out my opinion. In his essay on “Cannibalism,” he says:\r\n“Before I can bring my mind to believe in the existence of cannibalism\r\nsuch as I have defined it at the commencement of these fugitive notes\r\n(the feeding of man upon man incited solely by the calls of hunger) I\r\nmust be convinced that there really does exist a human being, no matter\r\nin what part of the world, who will slay his fellow man without any\r\nprovocation having been offered or any excitement produced, but that he\r\nis known to deprive him of his life merely for a supply of daily food,\r\njust exactly with the same feelings and with no other than we should\r\nshoot a hare or a pheasant to entertain a dinner party.”[13] I have\r\nquoted this eminent author verbatim, and though there appears to be an\r\nomission of some such word as “not only,” his meaning is sufficiently\r\nevident.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun went down the night became bitterly cold, so lighting a\r\nlarge wood fire, we sat round its crackling flames, which threw a lurid\r\nglare on as motley a group as that cave had ever held within its walls.\r\nWhite and black, male and female, horses and dogs. There we might have\r\nbeen seen, clustered all night round the embers of the dying fire,\r\ndozing and “dreaming” anything but “the happy hours away.” At early\r\ndawn, all shivering and shaking, hungry and tired, we began our return\r\nto Captain Allison’s, where our native servants, not knowing what had\r\nbecome of us, were overjoyed on our arrival.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FALLS OF THE UMGENI, HOWICK, NEAR PIETERMARITZBURG.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom the place where we were outspanned we could see standing out in\r\nbold relief some few miles away the magnificent panorama of the\r\nDrakensberg range, the white silver streak of the Tugela dashing down\r\nthe mighty cliffs and dark, buttressed precipices in front, breaking\r\ninto “snow-white foam, leaping from rock to rock like the mountain\r\nchamois,” and in the far distance, filling up the background of the\r\npicture, the towering crests 10,000 feet high, of Champagne Castle and\r\nGiant’s Castle, the highest summits of the range.\r\n\r\nResting a day and enjoying the inspection of Captain Allison’s stock,\r\nadmiring his horses, trying their speed and jumping powers in\r\nhurdle-racing over the _veldt_, and indulging in a little long-range\r\nrifle practice, I made all arrangements to leave my wife at the foot of\r\nthe mountain, ascend and see the falls from the plateau, which, although\r\nextending far backward into the Free State, is terminated so abruptly in\r\nfront by the precipitous cliffs of the ever-frowning Drakensberg.\r\nCaptain Hill being taken suddenly unwell, I started with three of the\r\nguides who had previously accompanied me to the Cannibal caves and some\r\nof my own “boys.” Climbing over a spur of the Drakensberg at Olivier’s\r\nHock, I struck a lovely valley on the south side of a branch of the\r\nEland’s River; but as the water was low at the time I was able to follow\r\nits meanderings for several miles. Jumping from boulder to boulder over\r\nthe water holes in its course, I ascended the rocky bed of what was then\r\na simple, gentle stream flowing along with quiet delight and singing the\r\nsame old song to which generations (for this country had once been\r\nthickly populated) long since dead and gone had listened.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, my guides, pointing to a large sandstone cliff up high in the\r\nbanks overlooking the river, suggested that we should rest. Scrambling\r\nup we came to a large cave, when, to my intense surprise and delight, a\r\nperfect picture gallery presented itself, the whole of the walls being\r\ncovered with rude Bushman drawings of bucks, elephants and men in\r\ndifferent positions, gloriously promiscuous but remarkably graphic. The\r\nwild, the untamed Bushman I have never seen. Small and repulsive, he\r\nlives entirely by hunting with the bow and poisoned arrow, and although\r\na few still lurk in the inaccessible cliffs of the Drakensberg range,\r\nwhich I was gradually nearing, the majority have been driven away by\r\nadvancing civilization to the borders of Damara land and Lake Ngami. On\r\nagain, after a rest of a couple of hours a few miles brought us to the\r\npass, where the final struggle had to be made. What I had hitherto gone\r\nthrough was child’s play compared to the task now in front. Large\r\nperpendicular rocks, which to clamber over seemed almost an\r\nimpossibility, stood in the way, as if blocking our further advance, and\r\nthe pass itself contracting in width toward its summit, shut out the\r\nlight and cast a weird and gloomy shadow over the scene.\r\n\r\nAt last, dead tired out, we gained the top of the mighty Quathlamba,\r\n10,000 feet above the sea. Walking on a few hundred yards through the\r\nscarlet and purple heather, which here carpeted the summit, level like\r\nthose of most mountains in Africa, I came almost at once to the banks of\r\nthe long looked for Tugela, flowing quietly past to the tremendous\r\nbrink, over which it was so soon to madly plunge and disappear. At a\r\npoint in the semicircle of crags surrounding the falls I sat down with\r\nmy “boys” all around me to admire the glories of a scene which they\r\napparently enjoyed as much as I. Never anywhere, either before or since,\r\nhave I beheld such a glorious sight, or one of such stupendous\r\nmagnificence and savage grandeur. Neither cloud nor mist obscured our\r\nview, and there we sat perfectly entranced, never thinking of the flight\r\nof time, drinking in the beauty of the landscape, which lay stretched\r\nout, a glorious phantasmagoria, thousands of feet below.\r\n\r\nDrinking a bottle of champagne, which at Captain Allison’s suggestion I\r\nhad brought with me to the top, I, with the natives’ assistance, set to\r\nwork and built a cairn, as a memento of the occasion, in the centre of\r\nwhich I placed the empty bottle with a minute of my visit inside; long\r\nere this, however, I expect some wandering Bushman or Mosuto in his\r\ncuriosity has leveled our handiwork to the ground, and felt the pangs of\r\nbitter disappointment on uncorking the bottle! The next thing was to\r\nprepare for the night. If it were cold in the caves below, what was it\r\nhere? When the sun went down I had to crouch over a fire which some of\r\nthe “boys” had contrived to light, though fuel was not easily found,\r\nwhile the others were busy making me a bed out of some dry heather which\r\nthey had been gathering.\r\n\r\nTurning in among this and the long grass they had cut, “tired nature’s\r\nsweet restorer, balmy sleep,” soon covered me over “like a cloak,” and\r\nin a few seconds I was indifferent to everything here below.\r\n\r\nEarly astir, we were welcomed by a most glorious sunrise, “the powerful\r\nking of day rejoicing in the east,” pouring forth a flood of beams\r\ntinted with such grandly gorgeous hues that with difficulty could I tear\r\nmyself away after casting “one longing, lingering look” behind at a\r\nvista of such beauty as it may perhaps never again be my lot to behold.\r\nBut before bidding this scene adieu, most likely for ever, the natives,\r\nby my order, pushed to the edge of the precipice a large boulder which\r\nthey rolled over the face of the cliff, whilst I, with a stop watch,\r\nlying over the precipice with one of my men to hold me, lest I should\r\nbecome dizzy, marked the time the faint sound of its striking the rocks\r\nbelow came back to my ear. This I tried several times with the same\r\nresult—twelve seconds—thus proving that the Tugela here falls in one\r\nunbroken sheet 1,600 feet.[14] After a cup of coffee, following out one\r\nof my original intentions, I spent some time in searching for the fossil\r\nremains of the large _dinosaur_, a gigantic reptile, which had been\r\nobtained in these mountains, but without success. At last we set off to\r\nfind Umbundi’s pass, leading to the Ulandi valley, named so by the\r\nKafirs after one of the peaks of the berg, by which route I hoped we\r\nshould return to the wagons. Following for two or three miles the edge\r\nof the Drakensberg, Captain Allison’s police found out the pass for\r\nwhich we were looking. We hastened on and coming to its entrance,\r\nimmediately commenced our descent. It was a narrow gorge, a perfect\r\nchink in the mountain, and the pathway leading down by a gradual slope,\r\nwe could see was nothing more than the acute angle formed by the meeting\r\ntogether of the opposite sides of the ravine. We left the top about 10\r\nA. M., and progressed very satisfactorily for two hours, the scenery\r\nbecoming at every step more fascinating, sublime and majestic.\r\n\r\nWe appeared to be gradually leaving the world behind and sinking down to\r\nunfathomable depths, while the cliffs above, majestically towering on\r\neach side, one after another disappeared from our view as we pursued our\r\ndevious course.\r\n\r\n                    “Echo to echo, groan for groan,\r\n                    From deep to deep replies.”\r\n\r\nAt last we came to a sudden stop, an incident which will remain engraved\r\non my memory as long as I live.\r\n\r\nWe were brought to a stand-still by a steep, smoothly-worn chasm in the\r\nrock, having a large and apparently deep pool of water, as clear as\r\ncrystal and as transparent and sparkling as glass at its base. How to\r\nget past this obstacle was the question! None of my guides would venture\r\nto drop over into the pool, and as the sides were equally precipitous,\r\nwe resolved, after mature deliberation, to turn back, and ascending\r\nagain, creep along a narrow ridge running longitudinally with the pass\r\nbut some 300 feet higher up the mountain sides. Thus avoiding the pool,\r\nwe hoped once more to descend and regain the more beaten track which we\r\nhad been obliged to leave. This we did in safety after experiencing\r\nimmense difficulty and danger. The mountain ledge to which we had\r\nclimbed, and along which we had contrived to limp our way, not being\r\nmore than a yard wide, and being studded with large, slippery stones and\r\nbordered by precipitous cliffs both above and below, sloping at an angle\r\nof 45°. As we descended from this giddy height, we at once found\r\nourselves in the forest of cypress trees (_Cupressus Wellingtona_,\r\nso-called after a botanist of that name) which I have before mentioned.\r\nThese trees,[15] clothed in their sombre funereal foliage, seemed\r\naltogether out of place, all the rest of nature seeming bright and gay,\r\nwhile they appeared doleful and sad. Making our way for some distance\r\nthrough what I may call this hypochondriacal freak of nature, we saw at\r\nlast signs of returning life and animation, the sheep and goats browsing\r\non the hillsides and the lowing cattle and neighing horses grazing on\r\nthe “veldt” below. I breathed freely once more when we emerged from\r\nUmbundi’s gloomy pass into the valley of rare beauty and attraction\r\nleading to Captain Allison’s, and wound our way through the kraals of\r\nthe Amangwani tribe, who people that locality, and I can assure my\r\nreaders that I felt relieved when, after a long day of danger and\r\nexcitement, I found myself safe at his hospitable house once more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE FALLS OF THE TUGELA, DRAKENSBERG.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo my intense disappointment, I found that through some mistake all my\r\nparty had left six hours before my return, leaving me to follow alone;\r\nso bidding Captain Allison and his family farewell, I rode after the\r\nwagons, but it was not until two next morning I caught them up\r\noutspanned nine miles beyond Colenso.\r\n\r\nNothing of particular moment occurred during our return to Verulam,\r\nwhere I shortly resumed practice, much invigorated by the change.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n         TAKING A HOLIDAY.—LIFE ON BOARD THE “RED RIDING HOOD.”\r\n                      MAURITIUS.—MADRAS.—CALCUTTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving heard of the safe arrival at the Vaal River, of my diamond\r\nventure which I mentioned in my second chapter, and being sanguine of\r\nits success, I determined to accept an offer to take charge, as\r\ngovernment medical superintendent, of a detachment of time-expired\r\ncoolies returning to India. It had always been a cherished wish of mine\r\nto see that historical land, and this presented a most favorable\r\nopportunity for me to gratify that desire.\r\n\r\nAfter getting leave of absence from the Natal government, and securing\r\nthe services of a _locum tenens_ for my private practice, I started Feb.\r\n10th, 1871, on a journey which proved so full of incident that I am\r\nirresistibly tempted to quote from letters which I wrote to my wife at\r\nthe time describing the journey.\r\n\r\nIt is true that neither the sacred land of the Ganges nor “Araby the\r\nblest” is situated in Natal or the Cape Colony, and therefore the\r\ndescription of my adventures in these countries is not strictly\r\nappropriate to a journal of “Twenty Years in South Africa,” but as my\r\nexperiences were at the time the comment of the Indian and Natalian\r\npress, I venture to reproduce them at the risk of any charges of\r\nwandering from my subject or of egotism, though I admit they might\r\nfairly enough be brought against me.\r\n\r\nBidding farewell to all at Verulam I spent the night in D’Urban, as the\r\nshipment of the coolies was not to take place until early next morning.\r\n\r\nThese immigrants, now homeward bound, had been the first shipped to the\r\ncolony, arriving there by the _Truro_, Nov. 17th, 1860, ten years\r\nbefore, and were now returning in the _Red Riding Hood_, formerly one of\r\nthe smartest tea clippers in the China trade. They were all got safely\r\naboard by noon, though the skipper did not heave anchor until evening.\r\n\r\nWith a favorable wind we left the shores of Natal. What we suffered and\r\nendured, the characteristics of our passengers, our disappointing\r\nquarantine at Mauritius, our arrival at Madras, the continuation of the\r\nvoyage to Calcutta and my own subsequent experience in Arabia, _en\r\nroute_ to Marseilles, the story of which is contained in the following\r\nletters, will, I trust, induce my readers to pardon the digression.\r\n\r\n                         “ON BOARD THE ‘RED RIDING HOOD, Feb. 22d, 1871.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR ——: ‘A life on the ocean wave, a home on the rolling deep,’\r\n  sounds very exciting and spirit stirring when sung on shore, but all\r\n  the excitement and enthusiasm vanish when one gets to sea on board a\r\n  ship with some 400 coolies, men, women and children, as companions.\r\n  Yet it was a sight worth seeing to behold the shipment at the outer\r\n  anchorage when we left of the lame, the blind, the paralytic, the\r\n  epileptic, the lepers without toes and the lepers without fingers.\r\n\r\n  “When the captain came off, he had got an absurd idea into his head\r\n  that as he had been obliged by the surveyors to separate part of the\r\n  hold for the women, that perforce the women must go there and leave\r\n  their husbands. This I strenuously opposed, and was supported by Davis\r\n  and Mason.[16] Now as there are not any single women on board, such\r\n  conduct on his part was preposterous. We telegraphed from the ship to\r\n  Pietermaritzberg, and got back an answer: ‘Make an amicable\r\n  arrangement’. The captain being simply obstinate, I became obstinate,\r\n  too, when, after haggling about the matter for four hours, he gave in\r\n  and I had my wish, and we got under way about six o’clock, losing an\r\n  anchor in the attempt; there was a rolling sea on, but very fine\r\n  weather otherwise, or I do not know what we should have done. The\r\n  scene on deck it is impossible to describe! Women lay about like logs\r\n  in helpless, speechless agony, children crying and yelling, and the\r\n  men, of course, doing the best they could for _themselves_.\r\n\r\n  “I felt like Job, ‘leave me alone, for all is vanity.’ However, I\r\n  recollected that old Job said this only when he was in the dumps, so I\r\n  felt almost inclined to laugh at my own self-inflicted misery in\r\n  taking the appointment.\r\n\r\n  “The whole of that week continued fine, and by degrees we got affairs\r\n  into working order. The ‘tween decks,’ where the coolies are berthed,\r\n  has port holes all along, and wind-sails are carried for ventilation,\r\n  so that the air can be kept pretty fresh. On deck there is a large\r\n  open kitchen built of brick, about twelve feet long and seven wide,\r\n  where their food is cooked. I have two interpreters, two ‘sirdars,’\r\n  four cooks and six ‘topasses,’ or scavengers, under me. The coolies\r\n  ‘fare sumptuously every day;’ they make most delicious curries of\r\n  their allowance, which is rice, fish, tamarinds, turmeric, dholl,\r\n  ghee, oil, mustard and pepper, as well as a sheep every Sunday. I can\r\n  tell you they do not get such feeding in Natal. A meal such as I have\r\n  described they get twice a day—at 9 A. M. and 3 P. M. At these times\r\n  we get them all on deck, and they present a funny sight, the different\r\n  family groups around their plates, helping themselves with their\r\n  fingers out of the same pannikin. Here and there a wife, more\r\n  attentive than the rest, feeds her husband, rolling the rice into\r\n  balls and popping them into his mouth. Of course, among such a motley\r\n  crew, we have some curious characters; one, styling himself ‘a Roman\r\n  Catholic priest to his own countrymens’ is a curiosity—blind of one\r\n  eye, a face with a sanctimonious leer, expressing, ‘What a fool you\r\n  are to believe me,’ grizzly locks and a jagged beard, presenting a\r\n  grotesquely solemn appearance. He sits day after day telling his beads\r\n  and singing hymns. He has got a written paper with him to the\r\n  following effect: ‘Gentlemens and Ladys, I beg to inform that I am a\r\n  very poor old man; I have lost my sight and i can only see with my one\r\n  eye and i have got small childrens to feed, so i hope gentlemens and\r\n  kind ladys will help me and my childrens, it will be great favour to\r\n  you, and God will bless you all and your families. I am your poor old\r\n  man Antony, a Roman Catholic priest for my own countrymens.’\r\n\r\n  “I give him an approving nod when I see him, a little grog to keep his\r\n  throat moist, and in return get the advantage of his petitions to the\r\n  Throne of Grace, morning, noon and night.\r\n\r\n  “The familiarity of these semi-Christians with Holy Writ is something\r\n  ludicrous. ‘How are you getting on this morning, Interpreter?’ I said\r\n  to-day. ‘Very well, thank you; by the favor of the Lord Christ\r\n  _first_, and secondly by favor of your honor.’ You see the relative\r\n  position I hold here. Another, an old woman, who boasts of ‘Coffee\r\n  Lister’ as her former master, continually holds up to me a rotten old\r\n  blanket and says: ‘Present from the Natal government; good government,\r\n  very!’ but adds, if I will give her a blanket, she ‘will pray the good\r\n  Lord for me, my wifes [_sic_] and my families.’ We have also tailors,\r\n  barbers, washermen and jewelers with us, who all do a roaring trade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  UMBUNDI’S PASS, DRAKENSBERG RANGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “But to proceed with my description of the ship and its ‘cargo.’ It is\r\n  hard work to make them keep clean; they seem to abhor cold water.\r\n  There is, however, on board a strong force pump, which enables me to\r\n  do my duty. Every other morning I have the men brought forward and\r\n  stripped, then I have the sea water pumped on them _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\n  “As a body they have a large amount of money with them. The Calcutta\r\n  coolies, especially some of them, have as much as £50, £70 and £100\r\n  each, one man has £300, showing very forcibly the result of industry\r\n  and sobriety, or rather ‘taking care of the pence, and leaving the\r\n  pounds to take care of themselves’! Domestic squabbles are of frequent\r\n  occurrence. One little wretch of a woman leads a stalwart six-footer\r\n  an awful life—all day long she is nagging at him, but at night she\r\n  excels, for she yells, and shouts, and chatters, and cries, enough to\r\n  deafen one. Last night she pealed out a regular triple bob-major from\r\n  her belfry, but so discordantly that for the first time I had a\r\n  patient in hospital! I relieved him for once of his better half,\r\n  locking her up for the night by herself in the dark, to brew mischief\r\n  for the morrow, and pull her own hair instead of that of her husband.\r\n  She came out this morning, however, considerably subdued.\r\n\r\n  “Feb. 27th.—Since writing the above we have made scarcely any\r\n  progress, and are just now drifting in an entirely opposite direction\r\n  to the one we wish to take, and are some 600 miles distant from\r\n  Mauritius.\r\n\r\n  “March 4th, 9 A. M.—Just arrived off Port Louis, have anchored, and\r\n  the health officer has been alongside, and who should he be but an old\r\n  fellow-student of mine. We were told that Paris capitulated on Jan.\r\n  26th, 1871, but nothing further, as we are quarantined because we have\r\n  coolies on board. We have, however, from the Bell buoy a good view of\r\n  the harbor and town of Port Louis, as well as of the Pieter Botte\r\n  mountain, which, I believe, has been ascended two or three times. It\r\n  has a curious summit, which it is almost an impossibility to ascend,\r\n  though this has been accomplished by flying a kite over, and so\r\n  getting ropes across. Things seem very different here from Natal, and\r\n  on an older and more established footing. After waiting until 3\r\n  o’clock, no permit has come for us to go on shore, but water has come\r\n  alongside, at least the authorities left it about 200 yards from us\r\n  and we had to fetch it, all the crew leaving the water boat. Why such\r\n  absurd regulations should exist, when our ship is perfectly healthy\r\n  and from a healthy port, I cannot possibly understand. We might surely\r\n  have all the plagues of Egypt on board, combined with a mixture of\r\n  cholera, yellow fever and small-pox, to account for the way we are\r\n  treated. They even float a letter to us, in a boat with a tow line;\r\n  like Mr. Meagles in ‘Little Dorrit,’ it is enough to make one ‘Allong\r\n  and Marshong,’ and fume and swear; but so it is.\r\n\r\n  “The master of the quarantine boat will come presently to get paid for\r\n  the water, and he takes away any letters, and this among others....\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                              “AT SEA, March 16th, 1871.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR ——: In my letter to you from Mauritius, which I suppose you\r\n  will have long ago received, you saw that I was much disappointed by\r\n  not getting on shore through the quarantine regulations, which are\r\n  very strictly carried out. Round about Mauritius there are several\r\n  islands, viz., Flat Island, where a quarantine station is, Round\r\n  Island, where a light-house stands 365 feet above the level of the\r\n  sea, behind these Sugar Loaf Island, which rises with precipitous\r\n  cliffs, and is merely a bare rock, also the Islôt Gabriel. In sailing\r\n  without steam, vessels come to Port Louis at the windward side (east)\r\n  of the island, and sail in a kind of channel between these islands and\r\n  the mainland, as I will call it. We sighted the south corner of\r\n  Mauritius about 4 P. M., but kept off until daybreak next morning\r\n  (Saturday) when we made for our anchorage at the Bell buoy about\r\n  three-quarters of a mile from the shore. The coasting round the island\r\n  which we made was very pleasant. It was a beautiful sunshiny morning,\r\n  with a gentle eight knots an hour breeze. We passed the Gunner’s\r\n  Quoin, near which the English landed when they took the island from\r\n  the French, Nov. 29th, 1810, and very close to it we went, within a\r\n  stone’s throw. It is a large bluff which juts out with perpendicular\r\n  cliffs all around. The water is deep enough, but it would be a\r\n  frightful place to run against in the night. After rounding this\r\n  headland we stood closer in, and got pretty views of the island, and\r\n  the district of Pamplemouse, the background being closed in by the\r\n  lofty mountains, of which the Pieter Botte forms one of the principal\r\n  features, towering 2,676 feet above the sea like a Titanic obelisk. We\r\n  could see the green fields where ‘de sugar cane grows,’ the mills with\r\n  their smoky chimneys, the houses of the planters, with their steep\r\n  thatched roofs, beautiful verandahs and grassy lawns, well cut and\r\n  kept, running down in some places to the beach. As I gazed I pictured\r\n  to myself the poor groaning coolies, doomed to sweat in the mills and\r\n  to toil painfully in the fields; yet this even was a far easier task\r\n  than to conceive how the ‘Reaper, whose name is Death,’ who during the\r\n  last few years has been stalking through this island,[17] could ever\r\n  have used his sickle so keenly in such a pleasant place. We were soon\r\n  at Port Louis, passing by a barque from Newcastle, N. S. W., and\r\n  anchored just opposite a fort bristling with guns, over which the\r\n  Union Jack, ‘The flag that’s braved a thousand years, the battle and\r\n  the breeze,’ was proudly flying.\r\n\r\n  “‘From Hull, Hell and Halifax, “Good Lord deliver us,”’ the thieves in\r\n  the good old days used to devoutly pray. If they could have had my\r\n  experience their litany would have been ‘From all sailing ships,\r\n  coolie ships and Scotch ships, “Spare us good Lord.”’ The captain of\r\n  this ship is a Scotchman, his mate is Scotch too. The former seems\r\n  impressed with the idea that every one he comes in contact with has a\r\n  design upon him, and he is also morbidly impressed with the pleasing\r\n  delusion that all government officers are his servants, paid to wait\r\n  on him. I can here see and learn to my cost how to save money. The\r\n  flour we are using is quite sour, but still the cask must be finished\r\n  before another is opened; the potatoes are old and unfit to eat; the\r\n  salt beef is salt indeed, and the tongues are positively rotten—so\r\n  that to eat them is an impossibility—but when drowned in vinegar and\r\n  encased in mustard it is wonderful what an active imagination might\r\n  not fancy them to be. The butter is rancid; the tin soups splendid\r\n  emetics; the biscuit so hard that my poor teeth refuse to do duty; the\r\n  water so putrid that I find it advisable to hold my nose and gulp it\r\n  down. This style of living has considerably reduced me, but I don’t\r\n  grumble, as I see it would be useless, I rather chuckle internally.\r\n  The mate is a young, pig-headed, uncouth block of humanity, that wants\r\n  licking into shape with a cat-o’-nine tails, his principal delight\r\n  consists in calling those under him very pet names indeed. The second\r\n  mate is a decent fellow, young, a colonial, born in Tobago.\r\n\r\n  “We found we should have to remain three days before permission would\r\n  be given us to go on shore, so we got some water off under quarantine\r\n  regulations, having an officer in a boat sailing round and round us\r\n  continually at a distance of 200 yards, to see that no one had any\r\n  communication with us. With a glass we could see into portions of Port\r\n  Louis. This town lies at the foot of an amphitheatre of hills, and\r\n  seems quietly nestled under their protecting wings. On the one side of\r\n  the town lies the fort, with earthworks for defence, on the other is\r\n  the quarter inhabited by the black population, thousands of whose\r\n  little shanties we could see, built on the slope of the hill, and\r\n  surrounded with trees. Further on we had pointed out to us the railway\r\n  company’s works and the railway, with a fine viaduct crossing a deep\r\n  ravine. The Pieter Botte mountain, though not the highest in the\r\n  island, is very conspicuous. We weighed anchor at 10:30 P. M., and got\r\n  at last fair away for India. One event has occurred to break the\r\n  monotony of our journey, viz., the death of an old coolie woman. Her\r\n  body was committed to the deep without any religious ceremony the\r\n  morning after her decease, so that now, instead of\r\n\r\n                 “‘Shaking on her restless pillow,\r\n                 Her head heaves with the heaving billow;\r\n\r\n  and will continue to do so, I think, until the sea is called upon to\r\n  deliver up its dead, as we buried her in about 1,600 to 2,000 fathoms\r\n  of water, the bottom of which I do not suppose she will ever reach.\r\n  She has one son on board, who takes the matter very calmly, Mahomed in\r\n  the Koran giving good hopes of the future bliss of the faithful, of\r\n  which she, I am sure, was one, praying devoutly every morning with her\r\n  face turned to Mecca. In fact, these people would put to shame\r\n  thousands of Europeans in the way they observe their religious rites.\r\n  Going along the deck at sunrise, I can see some with their faces\r\n  turned to Mecca, others worshipping the sun, looking intently at it,\r\n  and returning thanks that they are permitted to see his glorious light\r\n  once more, others calling on the beneficent deity, Vishnu, whereas I\r\n  am afraid those who ought to know better omit to do anything of the\r\n  sort.\r\n\r\n  “March 27th.—Since writing last we have had three more deaths—a man, a\r\n  woman and a child. Before they were committed to the deep they were\r\n  neatly sewn up in long canvas bags. The man, when he was put\r\n  overboard, seemed unwilling to leave us. He got caught on a chain\r\n  level with the waves, and at the speed we were going, with his back\r\n  bent tightly across it, he stuck for a long time, it seeming\r\n  impossible to shake him off! The poor woman was a Christian, and my\r\n  Roman Catholic friend came to the front in full force. It was quite\r\n  refreshing to see the energy he exhibited and the gusto with which he\r\n  repeated his prayers and told his beads. He evidently seemed to\r\n  appreciate the opportunity which providence had afforded him of\r\n  showing his peculiar powers. I do not know whether you have seen any\r\n  one buried at sea, but on me the peculiar, solemn plash which the body\r\n  gives when it touches the water, has even a more impressive effect\r\n  than when the earth thrown on a coffin-lid rattles a doleful\r\n  accompaniment to the refrain, ‘ashes to ashes and dust to dust.’\r\n\r\n  “31st.—Weather is still continuing very calm. The coolies yesterday\r\n  determined to make a grand offering to the Deity. All shades of\r\n  religious opinions merged their differences, Mussulmen, Brahmins,\r\n  Christians, all contributing something to propitiate the Almighty\r\n  Power which ‘unseen they feel.’ You may laugh, but I also contributed,\r\n  when after a prayer to Allah and his prophet Mahomed, we all shouted a\r\n  grand ‘Hurrah!’—an unanimous shout it was. After this the money\r\n  offering was tied up in a bag and fastened to the top of the mainmast,\r\n  in ‘sure and certain hope’ of a fair wind resulting. Strange to say,\r\n  such has followed, and this morning we are bowling along at ten knots\r\n  an hour.\r\n\r\n  “April 8th.—Yesterday we sighted Ceylon, and during the day sailed\r\n  slowly past it at a good distance from its shores, which with a glass\r\n  I could see to be magnificently wooded. The first conquerors of Ceylon\r\n  were Portuguese, the Dutch took it from them, and the English in turn\r\n  drove out the latter, and have held it ever since, which, _mutatis\r\n  mutandis_, is about the history of all our colonies.\r\n\r\n  “The highest mountain in Ceylon is called Adam’s Peak, about 7,000\r\n  feet above the sea, which we could see dimly in the far background.\r\n  Nearer us, we saw ‘Westminster Abbey,’ some 2,000 feet high, and much\r\n  closer to the coast. We are now within 300 miles of Madras.\r\n\r\n  “April 11th.—Madras is a splendid place to look at from shipboard. I\r\n  go ashore this morning. Surf-boats came early alongside, curious\r\n  looking things, about forty feet long, very light, not drawing more\r\n  than two feet of water, and manned by thirteen to sixteen coolies,\r\n  with long oars. We saw also some catamarans, these being made of three\r\n  logs of wood just tied together, and it is perfectly astonishing to\r\n  see how they go along over the surf, paddled by two Hindoos. Well, the\r\n  captain and myself went ashore, to dance attendance at the halls of\r\n  the great. How it would open some of the Natal people’s eyes if they\r\n  could only see how things are done here! to see the Hindoo clerks in\r\n  the merchants’ houses, in the custom-house, everywhere; fine tall men,\r\n  some young, some old and venerable, all arrayed in spotless white,\r\n  with matchless turbans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SUMMIT OF PIETER BOTTE MOUNTAIN. 2,676 FEET HIGH.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “The luxury, the silent evidence of wealth and prosperity which one\r\n  sees everywhere, is very great in contrast with poor little Natal. The\r\n  office of the agent of the ship is as grand a building as the D’Urban\r\n  court-house, and far more luxuriously fitted up, punkahs playing all\r\n  day, and diffusing a cooling breeze. Nobody thinks of walking; in cabs\r\n  and carriages by hundreds the black and white are all riding. It is\r\n  rather curious to see the old chimney pot again; it seems the correct\r\n  thing here for ‘dress,’ that is the band and the park after the sea\r\n  breeze sets in, say at 5 P. M. I went this afternoon to the people’s\r\n  park to see the menagerie. They possess some splendid lions, tigers,\r\n  jackals, monkeys, etc., but I could not stop to hear the band, as my\r\n  time was limited.\r\n\r\n  “The collector of customs and the port doctor are coming off to-morrow\r\n  morning at 7 o’clock to pass the coolies. I expect the captain will\r\n  want me to go with him to Calcutta.\r\n\r\n                OFF SAUGOR LIGHT-HOUSE, RIVER HOOGHLY, April 21st, 1871.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR ——: I hope you have received a note informing you of my\r\n  coming on here from Madras. I will now endeavor to follow my own\r\n  footsteps over again on paper. On the Tuesday morning I landed at\r\n  Madras. It is a large city, built right on the sea-beach, facing the\r\n  rolling surf; it seems a mystery that anybody should ever have thought\r\n  of founding a city on such a site, but in the days when the old East\r\n  India Company was merely a mercantile, cotton buying and speculating\r\n  firm, before it thought, by mixing itself in native broils, to\r\n  increase its power, this was done, as much, no doubt as anything for\r\n  the purpose of opposing some of the aggressions which the French at\r\n  Pondicherry, some sixty miles to the south, were then making, for the\r\n  French taught us the plan of ‘protecting’ the natives. It was entirely\r\n  in this Presidency that Lord Clive, from being a mere clerk, achieved\r\n  his early renown, and managed before he was twenty-seven to retire on\r\n  £40,000 a year.\r\n\r\n  “Well, the town and suburbs extend some four or five miles along the\r\n  beach. Talk about hardening the D’Urban streets, but to harden these\r\n  must have cost a mint of money. They are all around for miles as level\r\n  as a billiard table, or if you would prefer the simile, as flat as a\r\n  grave-stone—the game, you know, gets finished at both places! The\r\n  merchants’ offices, post-office, telegraph office, Supreme Court, are\r\n  all near the pier, and to the rear and southward of these is the\r\n  native town. These public buildings are all fine ones, though the dust\r\n  and glare give the outside of them a parched appearance; inside,\r\n  however, they are got up ‘regardless of expense.’ Comfort must be\r\n  thought of in this climate. Further still to the south, say a mile, is\r\n  Fort St. George. This is the first fort I have been in, and it seemed\r\n  to my inexperienced eye to be impregnable, bastion on bastion, fosse\r\n  on fosse. The fort is lit with gas, and inside, which comprises, I\r\n  should imagine, some thousands of acres, there are the government\r\n  buildings, mint, soldiers’ quarters and arsenal. Here during the\r\n  mutiny came all the white people and the Eurasians, as they call\r\n  half-castes. There is also an American Ice Co., with a magnificent\r\n  ice-house some 200 feet high.\r\n\r\n  “Then I went to a native bazaar, where you may buy anything from a\r\n  work on medicine down to a pair of slippers. I was much struck with\r\n  the familiarity of these natives with English, nearly every man talks\r\n  it, and the hundreds of carriage drivers all speak it well. I\r\n  afterward visited the Mount Road, where all the aristocratic shops\r\n  are, and where the _elite_ do dwell, saw the governor’s house, then\r\n  the general hospital, a fine building, which I went round with Dr.\r\n  Chipperfield, a very nice man, who pointed me out many interesting\r\n  cases. On Sunday morning, at half-past five, I was on the pier to\r\n  catch the ship’s boat, got on board, and we set sail at once. While I\r\n  was waiting Lord Napier, the Governor, came down with his staff; he\r\n  looked quite pale and worn.\r\n\r\n  “It was most interesting to watch the Mausurah boatmen on their\r\n  catamarans, shooting through the surf, and difficult to realize that\r\n  before the building of the pier at Madras everybody and everything had\r\n  to be landed through this surf; now this pier, which is of light iron\r\n  girder work, projects beyond, and passengers and cargo can be landed\r\n  on it, which is a great convenience. Guessing roughly, it is 600 to\r\n  700 yards long, and during a terrible typhoon which raged here some\r\n  two years ago a French vessel ran right through the middle of it.\r\n\r\n  “Our captain, going up the Bay of Bengal, got very drunk. He managed\r\n  to crawl out of his berth yesterday the first time since leaving\r\n  Madras. As the fellow is detested, it afforded amusement (as his\r\n  suffering was self-inflicted) to hear him sighing, hiccoughing and\r\n  groaning with remorse of mind and stomach, unable to eat, afraid to\r\n  drink and just strong enough to call in whispers ‘Steward.’ I advised\r\n  a little brandy, ‘a hair of the dog that bit him,’ but recollecting\r\n  his greed, on second consideration, I thought it would be a double\r\n  lesson and that I could inflict a little more mental torture by\r\n  ordering champagne, stimulating his stomach and teaching his pocket a\r\n  lesson at the same time. We have fine weather this morning, but\r\n  contrary winds, and are tacking about, whilst tugs are provokingly\r\n  steaming past us, and puffing at us as if in derision.\r\n\r\n  “Saturday, April 22d.—When I wrote the foregoing yesterday, I did not\r\n  anticipate such a night as we have just passed. Anchored in these\r\n  roads (Saugor) for the night; at about 8 P. M. a regular north easter\r\n  came on. In my life, so far, I have never experienced anything like\r\n  it; it was accompanied by thunder and lightning. The crashes of\r\n  thunder made the ship groan again, and the lightning was like a\r\n  continuous exhibition of lime-light, the flashes succeeding one\r\n  another with such terrible quickness that I could, I think, have read\r\n  with ease, excepting that perhaps the light might have been too\r\n  luridly bright. Then the wind, I cannot describe—when I tell you that\r\n  it whistled through the bare rigging so that I could not hear myself\r\n  speak on the poop, may give you some faint idea of its power. The\r\n  moaning and sighing was painfully weird and dismal, reminding me of my\r\n  feelings long ago, when first reading ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’ where\r\n  Legree is worked upon by the moaning in the keyhole up stairs; but to\r\n  add to all this were the cries and entreaties of the coolies to obtain\r\n  freedom, the captain having battened them down in their quarters.\r\n  Well, it blew strong and stronger, faces began to get long and longer,\r\n  the captain looked as if he would give anything to get the tug, which\r\n  in his meanness he had that afternoon refused, and I began to think\r\n  that what appears to be to man’s advantage may in the long run prove\r\n  his ruin, and to wish that I had stopped in Madras.\r\n\r\n  “The anchor began to drag, excitement increasing, all hands to let\r\n  down a second, I knew too well we had not a third (you will recollect\r\n  we lost it at Natal), so now our hopes were centred in either the gale\r\n  moderating, or the anchors holding true. The worst thing for us was\r\n  the wind was against the tide, and tended to make us run over our\r\n  anchors and snap the cables. After about two hours’ anxiety the wind\r\n  gradually declined, but the thunder and lightning continued all night.\r\n  This morning we have taken the tug for £50 to Calcutta, some sixty\r\n  miles, so if all is well we shall be there to-night. ‘They that go\r\n  down to the sea in ships, see the wonders of the deep!’\r\n\r\n  “Sunday, 23d.—We did not get down to Calcutta last night on account of\r\n  a two hours’ detention in the river by another squall, and we anchored\r\n  about seven miles to the south. This morning we started at 4 A. M. and\r\n  arrived at the coolie depot at 7 A. M. The Protector was not long in\r\n  coming on board, and in an hour the ship was emptied of its living,\r\n  noisy, restless, filthy freight. Here ends the first chapter of my\r\n  coolie experiences, and the second will never open.\r\n\r\n  “India is a wonderful country, and Calcutta is a prince of cities,\r\n  ought I to say queen? It is lit with gas, and water is laid on to the\r\n  dwellings, up stairs and down; the houses are simply magnificent, and\r\n  here a man can see that it is possible not only to exist, but to live.\r\n  From Saugor to Calcutta, say 100 miles or more, as far inland as I\r\n  could see, the river’s banks were inhabited by a teeming population. I\r\n  speak truly when I say that every inch of ground was occupied. This\r\n  delta must give support to thousands upon thousands. It is easy in\r\n  observing this dense population to see how cholera, fever and\r\n  dysentery must play frightful havoc when they rage amongst it, and to\r\n  picture what terrible loss of life the failure of one season’s rice\r\n  crop would produce. The country is exceedingly low and flat, and there\r\n  is an embankment at each side of the river to restrain any\r\n  extraordinary rise. In the great cyclone in 1864 there was a great\r\n  storm wave forty feet high which swept over the whole of this\r\n  country—a regular deluge, the only wonder was how even one soul\r\n  escaped. The pilot told me that he came down next day in a steamer,\r\n  and though the river is a mile wide at Diamond Harbor, and continues\r\n  to increase seaward, he could see nothing but the dead bodies of men,\r\n  women and children, cattle and horses. From his description the sight\r\n  must have been a truly appalling one. Ships drawing some fourteen feet\r\n  and twenty feet water were driven three miles inland and left high and\r\n  dry.\r\n\r\n  “I have been driving about all day seeing the streets, shops, etc.;\r\n  there are here 25,000 white and more than a million colored\r\n  inhabitants. There is no such thing as walking, as the sun is\r\n  overpowering, and you feel as if it would knock you down, so powerful\r\n  is it. The Government House, where Lord Mayo resides, is a magnificent\r\n  palace. He and all the aristocracy are gone away to Simla, in the\r\n  Himalayas, for the hot season. I also visited the museum, but it is\r\n  badly kept, and there is not much to see, but the native bazaars are\r\n  the most wonderful places that I ever was in—narrow streets, full of\r\n  small shops, each crammed with merchandise of every description. A\r\n  man, to all appearance caged in a den, turns out and shows you\r\n  cashmere shawls worth thousands of rupees, another one jewelry,\r\n  another silks, another Japan and China curiosities—the business done\r\n  being astonishing. I have made up my mind to take a trip up country\r\n  before I leave India, and visit the principal memorable scenes of the\r\n  Indian mutiny—Cawnpore, Arrah, Lucknow, Agra, not omitting the Holy\r\n  City of Benares, the head centre of Brahminism, to which all good\r\n  Hindoos make a pilgrimage at least once in their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n     TRIP TO BENARES.—CAWNPORE.—AGRA.—HOMEWARD VOYAGE IN THE S. S.\r\n         “VIXEN.”—DISTRESS.—PERILOUS TRAMP.—ADEN AT LAST.—SUEZ\r\n                   CANAL.—ENGLAND.—AFRICA ONCE MORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving finished all the “red tape” (which the nature of my peculiar\r\ncharge demanded) with Dr. Grant, the coolie emigration agent in\r\nCalcutta, I made arrangements with the captain of the _Vixen_, then\r\nlying in the Hooghly, to take medical charge of his steamer on her\r\nreturn voyage through the Suez Canal to England.\r\n\r\nAs she did not sail until the 6th of the month (May), I found I had time\r\nenough left to visit, as I had proposed to myself, the principal scenes\r\nof the Indian mutiny. After spending several days in Calcutta, I left\r\nHourah, where the station of the East Indian Railway is, at the other\r\nside of the river, and took a return ticket allowing me to stop anywhere\r\nen route to Agra and back.\r\n\r\nIf I were to describe the whole of my trip, of which I wrote a full\r\naccount at the time, I am afraid I should weary my readers, the\r\ncircumstances and places connected with the memorable outbreak of the\r\nIndian mutiny being too well known to bear repetition.\r\n\r\nI may, however, briefly state that I visited the French settlement of\r\nChandernagore, twenty-two miles from Calcutta, like a French oasis in an\r\nEnglish desert, or a French desert in an English oasis, as my readers\r\nmay prefer, being only two miles long by one broad, and passing by\r\nnumberless stations, rested at Dinapore, and then went straight on to\r\nBenares, the Holy City. Here the bridge of boats across the Ganges, the\r\nthousands of temples and mosques, especially the Doorga Khoud, or monkey\r\ntemple, and its chattering, grinning crew of sacred inhabitants, the\r\nnumberless splendid _ghats_ along the river side, with thousands of men\r\nand women bathing and praying, the Lingam, or well of life, at which all\r\npilgrims drink, the burning “ghat” where bodies after being reduced to\r\nashes are committed to the Holy River, and the Mosque of Aurunzebe, kept\r\nme well employed for a day or two. I then visited Mirzapore, Allahabad,\r\na great railway centre, and came on to Cawnpore, saw, of course, the\r\nMemorial Garden, the well down which “a great company of Christian\r\npeople, chiefly women and children,” the dying and the dead, were thrown\r\nby the order of Nana Sahib, and then branched off to Lucknow. Never\r\nshall I forget the scene presented by the Kaiser Bagh, the great work of\r\nthe ex-king’s reign, and its gardens, the Secunderbagh, where the 93d\r\nHighlanders and 53d foot, in fearful revenge, bayoneted to a man 2,000\r\nrebel Sepoys, the fantastic _Martiniere_, a school founded by an\r\neccentric Frenchman formerly in the service of the Hon. East India Co.,\r\nabout eighty-five years ago, the Residency, where for five long months a\r\nlittle band of noble hearts held out, and the room where the shell burst\r\nthat was the death of Sir Henry Lawrence. I walked along the portico so\r\ngraphically pictured by Trevelyan in his “Cawnpore,” which called to my\r\nmind the passage where he says: “Still, amidst the fantastic edifices of\r\nLucknow, hard by a shattered gateway, rise or lie prostrate the pillars\r\nof a grass-grown portico. Beneath that verandah, in the July evening,\r\npreferring the risk of the hostile missiles to the confinement of a\r\nstifling cellar, was dying Henry Lawrence, the man who tried to do his\r\nduty.... An Englishman does not require any extraneous incentives to\r\nemotion when, leaning against the beams of that archway, he recalls who\r\nhave thereby gone in and out, bent on what errands and thinking what\r\nthoughts. Between those doorposts have walked Peel and Havelock, and\r\ngentle Outram and stout Sir Colin, heroes who no longer tread the\r\nearth.” The ruins of the Residency and the adjoining houses have been\r\nallowed to remain as far as possible in the state they were left after\r\n“the relief.” To describe, however, the cemetery close by, with its\r\nbeautifully cut green-grass turf, to picture the tombstones to loved\r\nhusbands, erected by devoted wives, and recount their deeply touching\r\ninscriptions, to portray the monuments in remembrance of comrades in\r\narms carried away by war, cholera, dysentery and fever, or to tell of\r\nothers, on which were written all manner of poetical extracts and\r\nquotations from Holy Writ, would be an impossibility. Full of melancholy\r\nmemories is the spot, and it was with a sense of relief I left the\r\nmournful scene. I then started for Agra, 906 miles by railway from\r\nCalcutta, visited the fort overlooking the Jumna, saw the celebrated\r\nbath with its mimic cascades in the Monarch’s Palace, and then drove to\r\nthe Taj Mahal, a mausoleum built by the Shah Jehan for the tomb of his\r\nfavorite Begum, which was finished just forty years ago at a cost of\r\n£3,000,000, heard the delicious undulations and marvelous acoustic\r\nproperties of its dome, dwelt with astonishment on the jeweler’s inlaid\r\nwork of jasper, agate, cornelian and other precious stones in the fine,\r\nwhite polished marble, and admired the noble cypress trees growing in\r\nthe gardens. After resting here a day or two I returned to Calcutta well\r\npleased with my excursion.\r\n\r\nLeaving by the _Vixen_, we steamed down the Bay of Bengal and stayed for\r\na few hours at Madras, on leaving which place our troubles began.\r\n\r\nAccidents were continually happening to the engines, delays were\r\nconstantly occurring, the wind was against us, until matters culminated\r\nas I will allow my letter to tell.\r\n\r\n                                       “IN THE RED SEA, June 20th, 1871.\r\n\r\n  “MY DEAR ——: Since writing to you from Calcutta we have been dragging\r\n  along a weary existence in such a steamer! what with opposing\r\n  currents, head winds and weak power, we only just managed to make Cape\r\n  Guardafui, when our coal ran short, such a game! hen-coops, wooden\r\n  boxes, spare spars, cabin partitions, then the masts were burned to\r\n  keep us going. At last the captain sent the chief officer away in an\r\n  open boat to Aden, which was distant some forty miles, on Sunday\r\n  evening the 4th, to try and obtain a tug or coal. After he left, the\r\n  steamer would not even steer under the sail she carried, but drifted\r\n  down on the Arabian coast, until we were compelled to anchor on\r\n  Wednesday, about 9 A. M. The captain and myself, with four boatmen, at\r\n  once went on shore to see what the country was like and to see if wood\r\n  was procurable. As you can imagine, distilling water with spars worth\r\n  from £20 to £50 each was not a paying game. We landed and found low\r\n  brushwood which would answer the purpose, and immediately signaled the\r\n  steamer for another boat and a working party to come off; we then\r\n  walked in the direction of some lofty mountains inland, when we saw\r\n  the natives, roving Arabs and Somalis, coming down in force; the\r\n  captain and I approached them. There was nothing else to be done, for\r\n  we were too far from the boats to retire, and found them all more or\r\n  less armed, the majority with old-fashioned matchlocks. Of course we\r\n  did not relish these appearances, as in addition they had large knives\r\n  stuck in their girdles, and all the books of sailing directions for\r\n  this coast characterize them as bloody, cut-throat, treacherous\r\n  wretches. One of the boatmen, however, who came on shore with us, on\r\n  seeing them, ran off to the beach. Luckily for us the second boat had\r\n  just arrived, and meeting the crew he told them of our situation, and\r\n  they came running to our assistance. This had a salutary effect upon\r\n  them, and gave us an opportunity to retire. As matters on board were\r\n  proceeding to extremities, and seeing there was a doubt whether the\r\n  mate had got to land or not, I volunteered, with the second steward\r\n  and two darkies, to walk to Aden. The captain said the distance was\r\n  about sixty miles, but we found it, however, in the long run, to be\r\n  nearer 160. These Arabs seemed of two parties, and one of the more\r\n  friendly made signs in the direction of Aden, as if he would accompany\r\n  us there.\r\n\r\n  “Persuading the captain to let me go, away I went with my companions\r\n  at 3 P. M., armed, but with very little water or provisions, as I\r\n  fully anticipated reaching Aden, by walking all night, at about ten\r\n  o’clock next day. We walked at a good pace, as we were going through a\r\n  country peopled by tribes not to be depended on, keeping the sea-beach\r\n  in order to push through and get past a point where probably they\r\n  might intercept us. We walked until after dark, took a rest and bath\r\n  in the sea, and then pushing on, as we heard guns firing in the pitchy\r\n  darkness both on our right and left. The phosphorescence of the\r\n  breaking surf casting a lurid glare over all. Our guide seemed uneasy,\r\n  fired his gun, and then away he went. We thought we were in a regular\r\n  trap; lying down on the sand, straining our eyes in the dismal\r\n  darkness, we talked over the folly of our starting, asked ourselves\r\n  who would thank us if we got our throats cut, and then, seeing our\r\n  revolvers all right, we determined to sell our lives as dearly as we\r\n  could if attacked. After an hour’s anxious watching and waiting for\r\n  the moon, up came three camels with the guide whom we had suspected of\r\n  playing us false. He urged us to hurry on, which you may guess we did,\r\n  not stopping until 2:30 next morning, nearly done up. Stretching\r\n  ourselves out, sleep wanted no wooing. I was off in a minute, and from\r\n  the appearance of the moon must have slept about an hour, when we were\r\n  awakened by a terrible hot wind. You cannot imagine anything like it;\r\n  my hair was dry as stubble in a few moments, nearly stifled,\r\n  suffocated, the only shelter I could get was to the ‘leeward’ of a\r\n  camel. This wind continued for an hour, when we saddled up and away\r\n  again. Let me tell you what camel riding is like. If you can fancy\r\n  yourself in a blanket, with a man at each end holding it, and shaking\r\n  you continually from one to the other, you may have some faint\r\n  conception, but mounting is the worst. The camels are made to squat on\r\n  their bellies to enable you to get up, otherwise a ladder would be\r\n  needed. Well, when you are in the saddle, which is generally a most\r\n  clumsy, primitive arrangement, the camel gets on its knees, which\r\n  sends you backward, then up go the hind legs, and you get a contra\r\n  pitch forward, and just as you are anticipating to salute your mother\r\n  earth, he raises his fore legs, tosses you backward again, and you\r\n  find yourself mounted. One of my black companions had a young, frisky\r\n  camel which when he jumped on it made these movements so quickly that\r\n  number two generally sent him over the camel’s head or left him\r\n  hanging on by his legs, heels up, head down, round his neck. It is\r\n  always to me intensely ludicrous to hear a nigger swear in English,\r\n  and I think the most rigid Puritan would have laughed, at any rate in\r\n  his sleeve, to hear this darkie ‘G-d d—n this young fellow (as he\r\n  termed the camel) to ——!’ and consign himself, the ship, the country,\r\n  the water, or rather the want of it, to eternal perdition, which he\r\n  did with a gusto perfectly exhilarating.\r\n\r\n  “We journeyed along on this day (Thursday) without intermission,\r\n  alternately riding and walking, under a blazing sun, whose piercing\r\n  rays almost struck us to the ground, blistering and swelling our backs\r\n  and feet even through our boots and clothes, until 11 A. M., when our\r\n  guide told us we were approaching the confines of a friendly sultan,\r\n  who rejoiced in the name of Hyder, surnamed the ‘six-fingered,’ on\r\n  account of this work of supererogation accomplished by nature on his\r\n  behalf. Sending on a messenger to apprise his highness of our coming,\r\n  we gradually came in sight of a large mud fort, with some buildings\r\n  alongside, a small mosque, with date trees around, and the remains of\r\n  what once must have been a large city. Off-saddling at a distance of\r\n  about 200 yards, a messenger came to us from the sultan, shook hands\r\n  with us all, and then taking mine in his, like two schoolboys, we\r\n  advanced a short distance, stood in line, fired a salute, and then\r\n  walked up to be presented. The sultan, who was a fine-looking fellow,\r\n  stood outside a small tent (which was matted inside and had carpets\r\n  for himself and his visitors) with a body-guard on each side of about\r\n  thirty men. All tattered and torn, dirty, sunburnt and unshaven, we\r\n  were sad specimens indeed of Englishmen. I felt, for my part, somewhat\r\n  ashamed of myself. He, however, received us most graciously, shook\r\n  hands and invited us in, coffee was served in little cups, as hot and\r\n  bitter as Cayenne pepper, and cold water was also supplied, a beverage\r\n  which I never before so truly appreciated. Milk, dates, goat’s flesh,\r\n  round cakes made of grain, were given us as well. Did not we eat!—no\r\n  questions as to knives, forks, plates or dishes—our black friend\r\n  simultaneously falling to. It is in cases like this only that one\r\n  appreciates a man as a man; my hard-swearing friend being a regular\r\n  good fellow.\r\n\r\n  “After this, the sultan, whom we managed to understand, expressed his\r\n  pleasure at our having escaped with our lives from the tribes\r\n  inhabiting the locality where we landed and through which we had\r\n  passed, and wished me to give him a written acknowledgment of our\r\n  having left his place in safety, so that if anything befell us between\r\n  there and Aden, he would have this paper to show the English\r\n  government. Moreover, as he lived a mile from the sea, and possessed\r\n  boats, he offered to send a boat’s crew of ten men to the steamer at\r\n  once, to give the shadow, if not the reality of his protection, and\r\n  also offered us a boat to Aden. As I was suspicious, I declined giving\r\n  him the document he wanted until we were in the boat, but he pressed\r\n  very much for it, so at last I gave it him, but started immediately,\r\n  so that we might get clear of his people if he meant treachery.\r\n  Arriving at the beach, the boat getting ready to take us to Aden was\r\n  such a small, leaky, crazy thing, and the sea was running so high\r\n  outside and the surf breaking so heavily on the beach, that I demurred\r\n  going in it. Fancy spending two days and a night in an open boat of\r\n  that description. For my own part I would ten times sooner get shot at\r\n  on land with a chance of escape than be upset at sea, and finish my\r\n  career with a stomach full of salt water. So we started away again\r\n  with the camels, getting water at a well close by to take with us,\r\n  which we carried in skins tied to their sides. Most of these people\r\n  had never seen a white man before. We saw some women at this well, not\r\n  bad looking; one of them had a baby, which she carried in a sort of\r\n  triangular flat wicker basket under her arm. She was quite afraid of\r\n  me when I went near to look at it. Pushing on until long after sunset,\r\n  and striking inland for a few miles from the coast, we came at last to\r\n  a camp of Bedouins in a district of bare sand (with a little low bush\r\n  interspersed), drifted into mounds like snow driven by the wind. There\r\n  were also, here and there, the dry beds of rivulets, which in the wet\r\n  season take the water of the hills to the sea. Here we rested for the\r\n  night, and a lovely night it was, magnificently starlight and the\r\n  atmosphere beautifully clear. Lying down, in less than a minute I was\r\n  oblivious to everything here below. I left one of the darkies to keep\r\n  watch, but starting up in a short time, I found the revolvers I had\r\n  laid at my head gone and the nigger fast asleep. Presently our Arab\r\n  guide, seeing me moving, came back with them from an adjoining\r\n  camp-fire of Bedouins, where he had been exhibiting them and his\r\n  knowledge of firearms at the same time, and what was better still,\r\n  brought with him some goats’ milk and dates. Next morning the camels\r\n  were lost, and we did not start until 7 o’clock. The intermediate time\r\n  we occupied in rifle and pistol practice with the Arabs who came\r\n  flocking around us at daybreak. They were very civil, seeing we had\r\n  one of the sultan’s men with us. We took away a small goat on credit,\r\n  as between this and Aden we understood we should get no more food.\r\n  Another frightful, scorching day (Friday) succeeded, but there was\r\n  nothing for it but to go on.\r\n\r\n  “My companion, who at the beginning of the trip had been very lively,\r\n  continually singing ‘Up in a balloon, boys; up in a balloon,’ had come\r\n  down from his lofty aspirations to the level of this world again, and\r\n  a little below. The ‘Dead March in Saul’ would now have been too quick\r\n  for him to march to. My black friend’s oaths were getting less fervid,\r\n  and your humble servant was beginning to feel as if he would have\r\n  liked to ‘rest in peace.’ However, being the head of the party he had\r\n  the _morale_ to keep up, so on we went; at 1.30 P. M., after six and a\r\n  half hours killing exposure, we arrived at a small, squalid, mud-built\r\n  village of Arabs. Everything was baked and parched as if it had been\r\n  exposed for months to the blast of a large furnace. They were the most\r\n  dirty, diseased, wretched-looking, poverty-stricken creatures I ever\r\n  saw; I cannot picture the place to you, the frightful glare of a\r\n  copper sky, the monotonous, ever-present sand, no vegetation, no\r\n  shade, no living creature, save here and there a wretched camel, a fit\r\n  accompaniment to the general misery, the place seemed perfectly\r\n  God-forsaken! We got into the empty upper story of a mud house, and\r\n  water was brought, of which we drank greedily. The news of our arrival\r\n  spread fast, the room was rapidly filled with men and boys, quite\r\n  amazed at seeing us, especially the steward, whose red hair excited a\r\n  good deal of curiosity. Getting them out as best we could we managed\r\n  to secure a short sleep, during which they killed and cooked the goat\r\n  we had brought, so that with a little rice we made a tolerable meal.\r\n  Here we got a change of camels and drivers, and started again at 3 P.\r\n  M. to a well at some distance to get water, the all-essential for\r\n  travel in this country. We found it very good and cold, the well being\r\n  at least 140 feet deep, the sides surrounded by marble slabs which\r\n  were worn into deep grooves, like the flutings of an Ionic pillar by\r\n  the incessant friction of the ropes, which for centuries had drawn out\r\n  the leather bags filled with the precious fluid. After leaving the\r\n  well a further six hours’ march brought us to another camp of Arabs,\r\n  where we only rested from nine until twelve, then off again; no rest\r\n  for the wicked. My back, with constant work, was beginning to feel\r\n  stiff, and my head to ache—unfortunately we had nothing to eat, and\r\n  were yet a long way from Aden. At about 10 A. M. (Saturday) we came to\r\n  another Arab mud fort, but could get nothing to eat or drink but some\r\n  filthy water, so black and putrid that after each draught I vomited\r\n  and vomited again, and some millet seed which we managed to fry.\r\n  Proceeding after an hour’s delay, we struck the sea-beach at noon, and\r\n  saw the rock of Aden, our haven of rest, looming like a giant spectre\r\n  in the distance, right opposite to us across a large bay. The sea\r\n  breeze was very pleasant and took away the feeling of intense heat.\r\n\r\n  “Here we rested to bathe, and then drawing our belts as tightly as\r\n  possible across our empty stomachs we jogged wearily along for many an\r\n  hour. To our great delight we came across some mussels, which we\r\n  greedily swallowed without calling for pepper or vinegar! This was the\r\n  most tedious day yet, no food, no water, and this great rock like a\r\n  nightmare confronting us in the distance, and to which we seemed never\r\n  to get any nearer. The camels were tiring, and we dare not walk on and\r\n  leave them, on account of the prowling Somali fishermen. However,\r\n  after resisting time after time the imploring entreaties of my\r\n  companions to stop, threatening to leave them and push on alone, we\r\n  came at 1 A. M. on Sunday to the gates of Aden, found them locked,\r\n  threw ourselves down on the roadside, drank until nearly bursting at a\r\n  well of brackish water, and slept a dreamless sleep after our\r\n  twenty-five hours of travel and exposure. I am thankful that I have a\r\n  spirit of dogged perseverance, or we should never have got there that\r\n  night at all. The more the poor devils prayed to rest the more I was\r\n  determined to go on. The steward had forgotten his songs, even\r\n  Snowball, as we called the darkie, had almost ceased to swear, and his\r\n  final oath, which came rolling out when he laid himself down to rest,\r\n  had a pious, subdued tone of thankfulness in it. Next morning, up with\r\n  the sun, we entered Aden as soon as the military opened the gates,\r\n  when we fortunately met the agent of the steamer, a Parsee, in his\r\n  carriage, who told us the chief officer having got to Aden in safety,\r\n  had taken assistance to the steamer, and she had just arrived. He\r\n  drove us to his house, where we had a glorious bath and a hearty meal,\r\n  told us of the astonishment expressed in Aden at our journey, and the\r\n  speculations made as to our ever arriving. We found the government\r\n  authorities had been communicated with, and in fact we were the lions\r\n  of the hour. Everybody congratulated us, and the ovation we received\r\n  on returning to the steamer amply repaid us for the dangers we had\r\n  passed. Lieutenant Prideaux, one of the captives during the late\r\n  Abyssinian war, who was acting Political Resident at the time, sent\r\n  for me to tell my tale, observing that no white man had done what we\r\n  had done or been through these tribes since 1845. We stayed in Aden a\r\n  few hours while the steamer finished coaling, and amused ourselves\r\n  walking around one of the most heaven-forsaken places conceivable.\r\n\r\n  “Picture to yourself the crater of a volcano with a town built in the\r\n  centre, to which access can be gained only through a gap, so to speak,\r\n  in the wall, conjure up in your imagination a place where sometimes a\r\n  shower of soothing rain never falls for years together, and then you\r\n  can fancy Aden. I send you a photograph of the tanks built to catch\r\n  and preserve the rain when it does fall.”\r\n\r\nI shall not weary my readers with the details of my succeeding letter,\r\nas I should be merely re-treading familiar ground, but I may simply\r\nmention that waiting at Aden for a day to coal, we steamed slowly up the\r\nRed Sea without any incident worthy of note occurring, until arriving at\r\nIsmailia in the Suez Canal, where we remained over the night. This gave\r\nme an opportunity of landing, seeing the place and the beautiful house\r\nand gardens of Ferdinand de Lesseps. We stopped the next night at Port\r\nSaid to take in more coal, and continuing our voyage arrived at Malta on\r\nJune 30th.\r\n\r\nLeaving the _Vixen_ there I proceeded to England, _via_ Marseilles and\r\nParis, as quickly as I could, as I did not wish to overstep my leave of\r\nabsence from the Natal government.\r\n\r\nWhile in England I proceeded to the north, saw the faces of old friends\r\nonce more, but as “time and tide wait for no man,” I tore myself away\r\nfrom old associations, and arranged to return to Africa in the _Celt_,\r\none of the Union Company’s steamers. We sailed at the end of September,\r\n1871. Fifteen years ago! It is wonderful what competition has done\r\nduring these few years in improving the speed and style of the steamers\r\non this route. Thirty-six long, dreary days we spent then on the _Celt_\r\nbetween Southampton and the Cape, now a little more than half this time\r\nsuffices.\r\n\r\nHurrying on to Natal by the coasting steamer I arrived there after an\r\nabsence of nine months, finding all well; but alas! the fortune I\r\nexpected from my diamond venture was _non est_. No news whatever had\r\nbeen received from the men I had sent up country. This fact combined\r\nwith the glowing accounts of the richness of the Colesberg Kopje (now\r\nthe Kimberley mine), the rapid fortunes made there, and the depressed\r\nstate of affairs in Natal, decided me to throw up my government\r\nappointment, and test my luck in the new El Dorado.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\nLEAVE NATAL.—FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE DIAMOND FIELDS.—SICKNESS AT THE DRY\r\n    DIGGINGS.—FATHER HIDIEN.—HOSPITAL ARRANGEMENTS.—QUACKS.—MEDICAL\r\n   REGISTRATION IN SOUTH AFRICA.—CURIOUS DECISION OF CAPETOWN MEDICAL\r\n BOARD.—A “MENDACIOUS” AND “DISHONEST” PRACTITIONER.—SANITARY CONDITION\r\nOF KIMBERLEY IN 1878.—THREATENED SMALL-POX IN 1882.—SO-CALLED SMALL-POX\r\n  IN 1883 AND 1884.—MADMEN and their treatment.—CLIMATE OF GRIQUALAND\r\n                                 WEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning to Natal after my trip to the East, I could at once see\r\nthat this bright little colony had entered on a cycle of depression.\r\nThis, as I have mentioned before, combined with other inducements, and\r\nthe fact that the diamond fields afforded a wider scope for practice\r\nthan the ever-decreasing population of Victoria County, determined me to\r\nsever my connection, at least for a time, with a district of which I\r\nshall always retain a most pleasing recollection.\r\n\r\nI left for the Fields in the beginning of December, 1871, taking the\r\nusual route by Walsh’s passenger cart, _via_ Pietermaritzburg,\r\nHarrismith and Bloemfontein to Du Toit’s Pan.\r\n\r\nAs I passed through Pietermaritzburg I called upon Lieut. Governor\r\nKeate, who inquired into the particulars of my adventure in Arabia, of\r\nwhich he had heard. He kindly granted me the further extension of leave\r\nfrom my official duties in Natal for which I asked, as I intended, if I\r\ndid not like the diamond fields, to return. Crossing the river Umgeni at\r\nHowick, and passing through the small villages of Estcourt and Colenso,\r\nwe came at last, after three days’ post-cart traveling, to the foot of\r\nthe Drakensberg. The road winding up the mountain was very steep, but in\r\nfirst-rate order and repair. The road parties of native laborers which\r\neach chief has to supply in rotation to the government, for, I believe,\r\na period of six months, at a fixed rate of pay, were evidently doing\r\ntheir work well, but nevertheless the climb was a fearful strain on our\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIRST “HOME” ON THE DIAMOND FIELDS, FEBRUARY 1872. TRAVELING WAGON AND\r\n    TENTS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe arrived in safety at Harrismith, the first town of the Orange Free\r\nState, lying within a few miles of the top of the Drakensberg, and next\r\nday, after a splendid drive at a hand gallop all the way, over a road as\r\nflat as a bowling alley, with a perfect Jehu at the reins named Brandon,\r\nthe heedless scion of a good old Irish family, came late in the evening\r\nto Bethlehem, a quiet Dutch town, with two or three English stores,\r\nwhere we rested for a few hours. Then inspanning again, on we drove past\r\nSenekal, a wretched little place of about 100 inhabitants, and Winburg,\r\nthe centre of a fine grazing district, to Bloemfontein, the capital of\r\nthe state. Here Mr. Brand, the President, since knighted (1882) by the\r\nEnglish government for his services in the settlement of the Transvaal\r\ndifficulties, after the war resided, as did also a bishop of the\r\nAnglican communion,[18] but as it was dark when we arrived, I saw\r\nnothing of the city. I heard, however, sufficient reports of the\r\ndreadful havoc that fever of a remittent type was making among the\r\nresidents on the diamond fields to make me anxious to arrive there as\r\nquickly as possible. We started next morning in the moonlight at 3\r\no’clock, and drove through, some seventy miles, to Du Toit’s Pan in one\r\nday. A long, dusty, tiring day it was, and as if to prove that “coming\r\nevents cast their shadows before,” we met three or four ox wagons\r\nbringing away sick diggers from the fields, who had been stricken down\r\nby the prevailing fever.\r\n\r\nThe sun had long set when we neared Du Toit’s Pan, yet the camp, as seen\r\nin the distance was one blaze of light. The stores and canteens were\r\nopen, thronged with customers, while the canvas tents of the diggers,\r\nsome lit up with candles, some with wood fires, and others blazing with\r\nparaffin lamps, studded the surroundings of the mine as with a\r\nconstellation of stars. When we arrived at Benning & Martin’s, _the_\r\nhotel of the day, the scene was one which almost baffles description.\r\nClusters of men, work being ended, crowded round the post-cart to see\r\nthe new arrivals, others thronged the adjacent liquor-bars, while every\r\none showed signs of hurrying bustle and feverish excitement. After some\r\nrefreshment, I took a short stroll through the camp. Novel sights and\r\ngrotesque scenes met my view at every turn, the lights in the tents\r\nthrowing “shadows on the wall,” in some cases of the most laughable\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KIMBERLEY MINE—FIRST STAGE, 1871.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my first night on the diamond fields. When I\r\nreturned to the hotel I inquired for a bed, but was assured that not one\r\ncould be had for love or money. Martin, the landlord, however, made me\r\nup a shake-down as a favor, on the end of the long dining table, where\r\namidst shouts of “play or take miss” from a party of excited loo players\r\nalongside I soon fell asleep. At an early hour on the following morning\r\nI took one of the many passenger carts plying to the New Rush, otherwise\r\ncalled Colesberg Kopje (Kimberley), and after a drive of about two miles\r\nwended my way to the mine on foot, along roads ankle deep in sand,\r\nbordered with stores and canteens built of iron, and with canvas tents\r\nof all sizes and shapes fixed promiscuously around.\r\n\r\nArriving at the edge of the mine I paused to observe the novel sight\r\nwhich met my eyes. In those days roadways extending from one side of the\r\nmine to the other were the scenes of constant traffic, the diggers\r\ncarting along them the diamondiferous soil from the claims to sort it on\r\ntheir various depositing grounds. Carts, horses, mules, oxen and men\r\ncrowded these narrow roads, on each side of which the claims were\r\nscarcely less thronged. The _tout ensemble_ was most interesting. Every\r\npatch of ground was occupied, the whole resembling a hive of busy human\r\nbees, bustling and elbowing, creeping and climbing, shoveling and\r\nsieving, to gather, if possible, honey from each opening flower, or, to\r\nabandon metaphor, to turn out a diamond from each bucketful of soil\r\nhauled to the surface. Not less than 10,000 natives, and from 4,000 to\r\n5,000 white men, I should think, were busily at work the morning on\r\nwhich I first saw the diggings.\r\n\r\nI knew that the Natal Verulam Co. had claims in No. 3 Road, and on\r\ninquiry I was directed to their manager, Mr. G. J. Lee, afterward for a\r\nlong period chairman of the Kimberley mining board. Just at the moment I\r\nfound him one of his native servants had turned out a thirty carat\r\ndiamond from a sieve which he was shaking, and having a slight tinge of\r\nsuperstition in my nature, I at once accepted this as an omen of good\r\nluck. While I was looking at the claims belonging to this company my\r\nears were all at once assailed by a deafening roar, for without any\r\nwarning all the natives in and around the mine ceased work and yelled\r\nout at the top of their voices: “Hullah!” “Hullah!” Such a babel I had\r\nnever heard before, and on turning round I discovered that a lady\r\nstanding behind me, who had come to see the mine, was the innocent cause\r\nof all the disturbance. On inquiry I learnt this was nothing new, but\r\nthat the natives from the interior, who perchance had never seen a white\r\nwoman before they came to the diggings, were in the habit of taking this\r\nmethod of expressing their surprise and pleasure. Patti, Nillson, or\r\nMarie Rozé never, I am sure, had a more enthusiastic greeting.\r\n\r\nWith Mr. Lee’s kind assistance, I got suitable quarters on the same day,\r\nand next morning commenced professional work. At that time there were\r\nonly two qualified men on the fields, but of quacks “enough and to\r\nspare.” It did not take long for me to settle down into practice, and in\r\nfewer hours than those who cast their lot in communities where they are\r\npersonally unknown, and where competition is keener, take years to\r\nestablish themselves, I found myself with as much as I could do, my\r\narrival being looked forward to by many Natalian friends, who seemed\r\nonly too glad to see me among them once more.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of those who consulted me were suffering from camp\r\nfever, as it was termed, which was malarial, aggravated by exposure to\r\nthe sun, tent life, bad water, obtained in the early days from exposed\r\ndams or polluted springs, imperfectly tinned meat and fish, a scarcity\r\nof vegetables, and last but not least by strong drink. Intemperance was\r\nand is, though not now to so great an extent, the curse of the diamond\r\nfields. I feel certain that, out of the number of cases (which during an\r\nextensive medical practice of fifteen years’ duration) I have attended\r\namong the white population on the fields, at least seventy per cent. can\r\nbe traced either directly or indirectly to excessive indulgence in\r\nalcohol, while the name is legion of the innocent natives who have been\r\npoisoned by the vile preparations passing under the name of brandy. The\r\nonly treatment for the local fever which could be relied on, and one by\r\nwhich its relapsing tendency could be thwarted, I soon discovered was to\r\norder the patient’s removal to a distance away from the malarial taint,\r\nthe sea-side if possible, as soon as the more urgent symptoms were\r\nabated, as only through an entire change of air could complete\r\nrestoration to health be expected within a reasonable time. The railway\r\neven in this matter has come to our help, as on the first approach of\r\nthe fever, the desired change can be obtained in a couple of days, or\r\neven less, and a threatened attack possibly averted. Cases of typhoid\r\nfever sometimes occurred, while dysentery, usually of a mild type, also\r\nexisted. Pneumonia, croup, diphtheria, and in fact the majority of the\r\nother diseases with which practitioners most commonly come in contact,\r\nwere rare, a physician’s practice in the early days on the fields being\r\nalmost a specialty. This, to a great extent, could be accounted for by\r\nthe population of the diggings being comprised of healthy and hearty\r\nmen, mostly in the prime of life. Accidents too were few and far\r\nbetween, the mine not being deep enough for the falls of reef or\r\ndiamondiferous soil to be dangerous, and no underground workings\r\nexisting, the dangers of steam, blasting powder and dynamite were as yet\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the fields were abounding, as I have said, in quacks, but since\r\nthen the qualified medical men have increased from two to twenty-two.\r\n\r\nThe river diggings having existed for some time, matters there had\r\nassumed more of a settled appearance than at the dry diggings. A wattle\r\nand daub house, originally built for the Rev. Mr. Sadler, a clergyman of\r\nthe Church of England, ministering there, was converted into the first\r\ntemporary hospital, but being found too small a more permanent building\r\nwas erected, which again in course of time made way in 1873 for a fine\r\nstone structure, which was unfortunately consumed by fire, and remained\r\nsome time in ruins before it was rebuilt. It is now chiefly used as a\r\nconvalescent home. The _Diamond News_ of the day bitterly attacked me,\r\nbecause I pointed out the folly of spending money in erecting permanent\r\nbuildings at Klipdrift, a place which was becoming rapidly more or less\r\ndeserted by the digging community. The absurdity as well as the cost of\r\nsending men with broken limbs, and suffering with fever, jogging\r\ntwenty-five miles over broken roads to a hospital, never seemed to\r\nstrike those who, having property at Klipdrift, were attempting at the\r\ntime to bolster up the place in contradistinction to what were termed\r\nthe dry diggings.\r\n\r\nThe Dry Diggings were not, however, entirely without any hospital\r\naccommodation. A large marquee was erected in 1871 at Du Toit’s Pan,\r\nunder the auspices of Father Hidien, the first Roman Catholic priest on\r\nthe diamond fields, who himself a short time afterward fell a victim to\r\nhis never ceasing devotion. I heard many accounts, when I arrived, of\r\nhis unbounded charity and tender care of the sick. I will relate one\r\nincident which came under my especial notice, and which occurred toward\r\nthe very end of his unselfish career. Not long before he himself was\r\nfatally stricken with fever, an unfortunate white man, a perfect fever\r\nwreck, covered with frightful sores and merely a living skeleton, came\r\nto him for relief. Father Hidien took charge of him, and several times a\r\nday, as no nurse could be got, would, with his own hands, wash his\r\nulcerous wounds. In the first stage of fever, until weakness bound the\r\nkind father to his bed, he continued with unflagging zeal to relieve, as\r\nfar as he could, the sufferings of this afflicted creature; but as the\r\nravages of disease made increasing strides and the visits of the priest,\r\nas a matter of course, grew fewer and fewer, it was pitiable to hear\r\nthis unfortunate fellow, who was lying in a small bell-tent near, make\r\nthe air resound with his unceasing cries for the good father’s help.\r\nThus he continued to beg and implore him to come to his side until he\r\nwas told that the parting spirit of his Samaritan comforter had gone to\r\nthe land of the “Hereafter,” whither he himself followed in but a few\r\nshort hours.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the arrival in 1872 of Dr. Dyer, who had been in the\r\ngovernment service of the Cape Colony, that two long, cool wattle and\r\ndaub buildings were erected near the race-course, providing beds for\r\nabout twenty patients. Dr. Dyer, Dr. Grimmer and myself attended to this\r\nhospital gratuitously for some time. Everything in those days was of the\r\nmost primitive description. A large tent served as a dead-house, and I\r\nwell remember, on one of my morning visits wishing to see the body of a\r\npatient who I was informed had died during the night, finding on going\r\ninto this tent merely the trunk of the poor fellow’s body left; the\r\nprowling, ravenous dogs, which then roamed about, having devoured the\r\npoor man’s limbs, which they had torn in pieces from his body.\r\n\r\nThe first case of lunacy which ever came to my notice in Griqualand West\r\nI also saw here. Divisions constructed of mud and wattles were placed\r\nbetween the beds to promote extra privacy in certain cases, so this\r\nlunatic when brought in was placed in one of these inclosures. There was\r\nbut one white man and his wife to superintend everything. The first time\r\nI saw this poor fellow I found him raving mad, without an attendant, or\r\neven a straight-jacket, tied down with ropes, struggling in his wild\r\ndelirium. The scene, but for its sadness, would have been ludicrously\r\ngrotesque. The madman having managed to withe his body round, and having\r\ngnawed a hole through the mud wall, and head all the time popping in and\r\nout like a “Jack in a box,” was attempting to worry the patient in the\r\nnext bed, the latter though almost frightened to death, being too weak\r\nto move away. The whole place was a chamber of horrors worthy of the\r\npencil of a Gustave Doré. Although the management was much to blame, and\r\nthe public were apathetic, yet the doctors attending did not escape\r\npublic criticism. I can even now call to mind one very scathing attack,\r\nwhich I believe had much to do with the removal of the building, in\r\nwhich Hood’s lines were applied to them:\r\n\r\n              “’Twas strange, although they got no fees,\r\n              How still they watched by two’s and three’s,\r\n              But Jack a very little ease\r\n              Obtained from them.\r\n              In fact, he did not find M. D.’s\r\n              Worth one D. M.”\r\n\r\nAt the time, also, I wrote to the _Diamond Field_ giving a description\r\nof the wretchedness of the place, and did what I could to promote\r\nimprovement.\r\n\r\nThe hospital, which was established at the jail, and which was entirely\r\nunder government control, was even worse than the Dry Diggings hospital\r\nwhich I have just described. At the risk of being a little tedious I\r\nwill give an extract from a description of this place which I wrote to\r\nthe _Diamond News_ July 7th, 1873.\r\n\r\n  “This so-called hospital is a tent about 12 feet by 9 feet in size\r\n  without even a fly. Through this during the rains the water beats, and\r\n  through the rents, which I also saw, the piercing wind on these cold\r\n  nights blows as through a funnel on the poor wretched sinners within.\r\n  It is not difficult for residents on these fields to picture further\r\n  what the state of such a tent must be, after a blazing sun has poured\r\n  its rays on it for hours in summer. Let us enter. Here a sight\r\n  presents itself which I wish I could adequately describe. On the bare\r\n  floor, deep in dust and sand, lie huddled together black and white,\r\n  criminals and honest men, no beds, no bedsteads, some with only a\r\n  blanket round them, and in this sorry plight they remain during the\r\n  rains, exposed to the chance of the water every now and then washing,\r\n  as it has done, right through, making the place rather a hot-bed of\r\n  disease, than a refuge for the sick—the floor of the tent being lower\r\n  than the surrounding ground. Here in the middle of the tent lay, with\r\n  but an apology for a bed between his body and the ‘cold, cold ground,’\r\n  and with an old piece of zinc roofing at his head to prevent it from\r\n  pushing through the canvas, a poor emaciated black, whose leg had\r\n  lately been amputated; in one corner a poor blind creature sat\r\n  piteously complaining, whilst in another corner a crouching native was\r\n  busily engaged ridding himself of vermin!\r\n\r\n  “I need not particularise further. One white man there was, however,\r\n  who told me he had been there twelve months. No doubt he could, if he\r\n  would, ‘a tale unfold’ of misery and woe. Strewed in motley confusion\r\n  on this dusty floor could be seen old clothes stinking with dirt,\r\n  boots and shoes, crutches and soap, tobacco and tea-cups, salt and\r\n  pipes, pans, buckets, a chamber utensil, half eaten provisions, an\r\n  empty bottle holding a half burnt candle, and, as if in sorry\r\n  burlesque, three or four Bibles provided with considerable\r\n  forethought, no doubt to teach the unfortunate inmates the advantages\r\n  of being ‘patient and long suffering in all their afflictions.’”\r\n\r\nThe miseries of these places, the _exposés_ that took place, as well as\r\nthe out-of-the-way situation of the Dry Diggings hospital, led the\r\nSouthey government to see the necessity of increased and better\r\naccommodation, and a new hospital was built on the road between\r\nKimberley and Du Toit’s Pan in 1874. Two or three days before it was to\r\nbe given over by the contractors a serious fire broke out and destroyed\r\nmore than half the building. The government, being short of funds, did\r\nnot rebuild the part burned down, but made the portion which had escaped\r\nsuffice for the wants of the community; and in Jan., 1875, the sole\r\nmedical charge was given to the government officer, Dr. Dyer and myself\r\nbeing retained as consultants. The medical care of the patients was\r\nhowever in Jan., 1882 transferred from the hands of the government\r\ndistrict surgeon to that of a purely resident surgeon, whose sole duty\r\nit was simply to attend to the hospital, government at this time\r\nresigning the management to a local board.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 the nursing care of the institution was undertaken by a certain\r\nsisterhood[19] of nurses and associates, under the superintendence of\r\ntheir head, Sister Louise, and it is impossible to speak in terms of too\r\nhigh commendation either of her management or of that of Sister\r\nHenrietta, who succeeded her, and who still retains that office and\r\nadministers its important duties in a manner which I cannot too highly\r\npraise.\r\n\r\nThe hospital received considerable addition in 1876, and again in 1882\r\nhad a large wing, an isolation ward and an extensive native ward added.\r\nThe medical tax, passed by the legislative council of Griqualand West\r\n(No. 2, 1874) of one shilling per month payable by each native, was\r\nreceived by the diggers, when it became law, with much disapprobation.\r\nIt was consequently allowed to remain in abeyance by the Griqualand West\r\ngovernment, until hospital matters came under the management of the\r\nlocal board, which I have before mentioned, in 1882. Then it was\r\nrevived, and has been since paid by the diggers and companies, without\r\ndemur, the amount being as a general rule deducted from the natives’\r\nwages. The amount has varied from £10,000 in 1882 to £6,000 in 1885. The\r\nKimberley hospital is now larger than any institution in the colony, its\r\nworking staff numbering over fifty, and it contains sixty-six\r\nsurgical[20] and forty-two medical beds for natives, twenty-nine for\r\npoor whites, twenty for paying whites, and an isolation ward with four\r\nbeds. The number of cases treated here is enormous, the capital\r\noperations for the last quarter in 1885 counting forty-four, and the\r\nadmissions amounting, during the same year, to 709 Europeans and 1,019\r\nnatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to the early days of field life, the quacks soon found it\r\nadvisable to take flight, as a steady influx of regularly qualified men\r\nwas appearing on the scene, the only one retaining any kind of ground\r\nbeing a non-qualified homeopath. This quack was always, however,\r\ncautious enough to consult with qualified practitioners when his cases\r\nwere _in extremis_, and by this means he escaped any penalty of the law,\r\nand procured a death certificate in proper order.\r\n\r\nIt seems passing strange, that in a sparsely populated though widely\r\nextended country or congeries of States, that a man possessing\r\nindubitable qualifications for the exercise of his profession, should be\r\nput to such frequent and utterly unnecessary annoyance in the matter of\r\nmedical registration as sometimes occurs in South Africa. A physician or\r\nsurgeon before he can legally recover his fees in every part of South\r\nAfrica, requires, as there are five separate States, to be registered in\r\nno less than five different places. I was early taught this in a rather\r\nrough way; one of the advantages which confederation would bring being\r\nvividly placed before me in a very practical manner. In 1873 I attended\r\na man and his family at Du Toit’s Pan, and as I found that no\r\ninclination existed to pay my fees, amounting to some eighty guineas; I\r\nsued for the amount, but was non-suited by the magistrate, on the\r\nexception being raised, that I was not a legal medical practitioner in\r\nthat part of South Africa, not being registered in Griqualand West or\r\nthe Cape Colony. As I was registered in England and Natal, I had\r\nneglected to comply with this form in Griqualand West, and consequently\r\nhad to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe law courts of this territory have also decided another important\r\npoint in medical law, agreeing in their judgment with English precedent.\r\nA medical man whose only qualification was the diploma of the Edinburgh\r\nCollege of Surgeons sued a patient for his attendance, who pleaded that\r\nhe being a simple surgeon could not charge for a medical case, and the\r\nHigh Court sustained the exception. To the astonishment, however, of\r\nnearly all the faculty in South Africa, the medical board in Capetown\r\nafter this, decided, entirely _ultra vires_, to grant permission to\r\n_“Edinbro’” Surgeons_, to practice medicine; consequently South Africa\r\nnow is an Alsatia, to which all semi-qualified men can flee who find it\r\nimpossible to enter the army or navy, or even obtain any poor-law\r\nappointment in England. Feeling myself interested in this matter, and\r\nbeing desirous of obtaining authoritative news from the “head centre” I\r\ntelegraphed on May 23d, 1884 to the late Dr. Ebden, who held the\r\nposition as president of the medical board in Capetown, to inquire “if\r\nthe board intended to doubly qualify simple surgeons,” and received the\r\nastounding reply: “Board considers Edinburgh surgeons entitled to\r\npractice medicine.” It would be curious to fathom the reason why this\r\npreference was given to men holding Scotch diplomas! Quite independently\r\nof the fact that this abnormal announcement is contrary to all law, and\r\ncontrary to the powers vested in the medical board, it is an injustice\r\nto the colonists themselves, and unfair to the rising generation of the\r\ncountry. In Europe there are at the present time more than one hundred\r\nand fifty medical students, sons of South African colonists, the\r\nmajority of whom are receiving a university education. Can it be fair to\r\nthese that they should be pitted against semi-qualified English\r\nadventurers?\r\n\r\nThe necessity of a medical act in South Africa, with proper penal\r\nclauses, becomes every day more apparent. The South African _Medical\r\nJournal_ in 1884, on giving a _resumé_ of that year’s events of\r\ninterest, drew public attention to one glaring instance, which had to\r\npass unpunished. In mentioning the case of two medical men, this journal\r\nobserves: “The latter, a L. R. C. S. of Edinburgh only, had been\r\npracticing as a physician, although gazetted as a surgeon only. He had\r\naggravated this by repeatedly signing his name with M. D. and F. R. C.\r\nP., a proceeding which was not only _mendacious_, but _dishonest_.” But\r\nyet this dishonesty had to remain without the infliction of any fine.\r\nThis case is one among many, which shows the urgency of legislation in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\nSince the creation of a municipality in Kimberley in 1878, and the\r\nconsequent introduction of sanitary regulations, duly enforced by law\r\nwhen necessary, the death-rate has very considerably diminished. The\r\nlate Dr. Shillito and the writer, in March, 1879, prepared an exhaustive\r\nreport for the mayor and town council on the sanitary condition of\r\nKimberley. The death-rate at that time was enormous, as can be seen from\r\nthe following table, which is a copy of that which we then furnished:\r\n\r\n      Total population     14,169 Deaths 867 Rate per 1,000 61.014\r\n      Europeans             6,574   „    236  „    „    „   40.005\r\n      Other than Europeans  7,595   „    604  „    „    „   79.052\r\n\r\nAt that time Kimberley was perfectly honeycombed with cesspools. We drew\r\nattention in our report to the evil effects of the existing system, and\r\nto the manner in which these had revealed themselves two years before,\r\nwhen an epidemic of puerperal fever and erysipelas robbed the community\r\nof many valuable lives, and we further showed that there was always\r\nexisting a remitten fever of a dysenteric and typhoid tendency, which\r\ncould in some measure be attributed to this defective sanitary\r\ncondition. Our report led to the adoption of the “Pail system,” and the\r\nnight-soil is now taken away regularly and buried some distance from the\r\ntown, the consequence of which is that the death-rate from disease has\r\ndiminished more than one-third, and the sanitary condition of Kimberley\r\nis to my own knowledge as good as that of any town in South Africa.\r\n\r\nKimberley, notwithstanding its improved sanitary condition, was in 1883\r\nand 1884 visited by a disastrous outbreak of disease, which cost the\r\ncommunity much, both in life and money. In May, 1882, small-pox was\r\nbrought to South Africa by the steamship _Drummond Castle_, and\r\nspreading, proved very fatal in the Capetown Peninsula (Capetown to\r\nSimon’s Town), 4,000, less or more, succumbing to its ravages. Great\r\napprehension was felt in Kimberley lest the disease might be\r\ncommunicated by the passenger wagons coming up from Capetown. Terror\r\nseized upon the digging community, and a quarantine station was\r\nimmediately established at the Modder River, some thirty miles from the\r\nmines. Every care was taken, and all passengers were fumigated with\r\nsulphur before they were permitted to enter Kimberley. As the result,\r\nseven cases of small-pox were detected and detained for treatment, and\r\nall those traveling by the same wagons were kept in quarantine\r\ntwenty-one days.\r\n\r\nThese efforts, which lasted from Sept. 1882 to March 1883, were entirely\r\nsuccessful, and not one single case of small-pox broke out in Kimberley.\r\nThis threatened invasion put the ratepayers to an expense of nearly\r\n£13,000, which, however, was a mere bagatelle compared with the outlay\r\nwhich the epidemic disease that broke out on the fields in 1883, 1884\r\nand 1885 entailed. This came from another and quite unexpected quarter,\r\nand was not imported seaward. A certain body of Kafirs, who were coming\r\nto Kimberley to seek for work, were attacked at Klerksdorp, in the\r\nTransvaal, a small town near Potchefstroom, with symptoms resembling\r\nsmall-pox. The doctors there declared the disease to be aggravated\r\nchicken-pox, when the Transvaal government, not being satisfied, Dr.\r\nDyer, who had been promoted to the chief medical office under the\r\nTransvaal government, was sent from Pretoria to report direct. In this\r\nreport, dated Oct. 25th, 1883, he gave it as his opinion (concurred in\r\nby Dr. Francis, the special commissioner of the Orange Free State), that\r\nthe natives were suffering merely from a severe form of chicken-pox,\r\ntermed by them “Isi-mun-qu-mun-gwane.” These natives were then allowed\r\nto proceed on their road to the diamond mines, but of the sixteen who\r\nleft Klerksdorp four only reached Felstead’s, a store about nine miles\r\nfrom Kimberley, when, the survivors being too weak to proceed,\r\ninformation of the fact was brought by passers-by. An outcry was soon\r\nraised, they were visited by medical men, materials to erect shelter for\r\nthem were immediately sent out, a doctor appointed, and all the\r\nprecautions commenced to be taken, which afterward led to so much\r\nexpense. The civil commissioner at once (Nov. 3d, 1883,) appointed a\r\nboard of six medical men to report on the disease, who after a prolonged\r\ninquiry left matters in _statu quo_, three averring that the outbreak\r\nwas small-pox, and the others (myself among the number) arriving at a\r\ncontrary opinion. Government then sent a physician from Capetown to\r\ninvestigate matters, who on Dec. 6th, 1883, declared the disease to be\r\nsmall-pox; so those declaring the outbreak to be a “bullous disease,\r\nallied to pemphigus,” and not contagious, as well as those declaring the\r\ndisease to be a Kafir pox,[21] or an aggravated form of chicken-pox,\r\nwere outvoted. It was during one of my visits, accompanied by Dr. L. S.\r\nJameson, to further examine into this outbreak that I met with the\r\nnearly fatal accident which I mention elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI will not weary my lay readers by entering upon a medical discussion,\r\nbut may refer my professional brethren to a verbatim report published by\r\nthe Diamond Fields _Advertiser_ in a book form, of the case of Regina\r\n_vs._ Wolff, where Dr. Wolff, an American physician of more than average\r\nskill, was charged with failing to report the existence of “small-pox”\r\nin the hospital of which he had then charge, in which the whole matter\r\nis carefully discussed. The outbreak of pemphigus or small-pox, which\r\nlasted in its virulent form from Nov. 1883, to Dec. 1884, cost the\r\ninhabitants of Kimberley and the mines of Griqualand West the large sum\r\nof £37,503, 15s. 11d. Medical services were paid for at an extravagant\r\nrate, two medical men alone drawing the sum of £3,320, 10s. 6d., and\r\nwhat with the erection of iron hospitals, fumigating houses,\r\ndispensaries, ambulance wagons, horses and highly paid officials the\r\noutbreak was an expensive luxury to Griqualand West as long as it\r\ncontinued. The Dutch, also taking alarm, stationed patrols on all the\r\nroads leading from Kimberley to the Free State, excepting four, on which\r\nthey erected fumigating stations just outside our boundary. At these\r\nstations they fumigated all Kafirs and others passing along, charging\r\nthose not resident in the State, whether white or black. Some idea of\r\nthe extent of this charge on the population may be formed from the fact\r\nthat at the Reit Pass station alone 11,570 were fumigated in three\r\nmonths. Of the folly and uselessness I will remain silent. When the\r\noutbreak first appeared, the “Act to amend the law relating to Public\r\nHealth,” No. 4, 1883, giving power to levy rates, and also for framing\r\nregulations for vaccination and quarantining was the only ordinance\r\nwhich applied, but in 1884 a special act was passed (Nov. 10th, 1884),\r\ngiving the Board of Health power to levy rates on boroughs and mines,\r\nand to defray expenses. This was followed in 1885 by ordinance No. 41,\r\nby which the government was empowered to pay one-half of all moneys\r\nexpended on account of small-pox; though previous to this the government\r\nhad acted with great liberality, having defrayed one-third of every\r\nexpense. The total number of cases reported from Nov. 1st, 1883, to Jan.\r\n1st, 1885, the months during which the epidemic was at its height, was\r\n2,311, and the number of deaths 700, or say 32.02 per cent. The\r\nproportion of white cases as against colored was very marked, the number\r\nof white being 400, with 51 deaths, or 12.07 per cent., and of colored\r\n1,911, with 649 deaths, or 35.42 per cent. A second attempt to revive\r\nthe scare was made toward the end of 1885, but this did not succeed,\r\nalthough twenty-five colored and one white man were sent to the\r\nlazaretto, alleged to be suffering from small-pox. A special commission\r\nto examine-these patients was sent out, on my describing a visit I had\r\nmade to this lazaretto, and on my drawing public attention to the\r\nabsurdity of the whole affair. This commission, although chosen from\r\nmedical men believing in the small-pox theory, actually certified that\r\n_half_ of the patients they saw in the lazaretto were not suffering from\r\nsmall-pox at all. My readers from this will be able to form an estimate\r\nof the cruel acts perpetrated at the time by ignorant officials, and to\r\njudge how, taking the small-pox view of the case, a loathsome disease\r\nwould be propagated amongst healthy persons—how the innocent and guilty\r\nwould suffer alike. After this exposure small-pox rapidly died out. The\r\nlazaretto is now removed to the west side of the mine, and the buildings\r\nsurrounded by grounds, twenty-two acres in extent, are stationed on a\r\nhigh plateau on the road to Schmidt’s Drift. At present Kimberley is\r\nperfectly free from any cases of this disease.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this chapter I made mention of the first lunatic I\r\never saw in Griqualand West, who, as he belonged to the police, was\r\nremoved, I believe, to Capetown, but ever since then, both before\r\nannexation and since, lunatics as a rule, up to a very short time back,\r\nhave been left to drag out their weary existences, the victims of\r\nheart-curdling neglect, in the common jail. In August, 1885, I took\r\noccasion, when speaking on the subject of lunacy, to lay bare before the\r\nKimberley public some of the scenes day by day enacted in their prison\r\n(their lunatic asylum?). In the course of a lecture I then delivered, I\r\nspoke thus on the subject:\r\n\r\n  “Here in the middle of the nineteenth century, in an era of boasted\r\n  civilization, the only care we can give our lunatics, except in\r\n  Capetown and Grahams town, is to herd them with criminals, and to\r\n  chain and handcuff them with brutal severity, pending an official\r\n  order for removal, which may _never_ come. It is a painful thought,\r\n  that among the poorer patients, who from the ills of life suffer\r\n  mental alienation; fathers depressed from loss or anxiety, mothers\r\n  from exhaustion resulting from the rearing of a large family, the\r\n  young man from vice, dissipation or disappointed hopes, and the\r\n  foreigner among strangers, looking wistfully back to his native\r\n  home—that these, all suffering from diseases which might possibly have\r\n  been stayed, should be thrust into jails without attendants, simply\r\n  put in irons if violent, and almost compelled through sheer inhumanity\r\n  and neglect to suffer the misery of incurable lunacy!\r\n\r\n  “As I have just said, in all colonial towns except two, as far as I\r\n  can learn, the jail is the receptacle of the lunatic. Kimberley, with\r\n  its vast wealth, with its go-ahead citizens, is no exception. What\r\n  tales the walls of its jail could tell! One poor black, to my certain\r\n  knowledge, has been locked within its gates for twelve long years, and\r\n  there you can see him—to-morrow if you like—bemoaning his fate, and\r\n  cursing the government in the same breath! A poor white girl, the\r\n  daughter of a man whom old residents must remember well in the palmy\r\n  days of the _Diamond News_, has day after day, and _every_ day since\r\n  1876, paced like a caged tigress up and down a small court-yard,\r\n  panting for freedom, and growling in despair! One poor girl, black her\r\n  skin may be, is handcuffed, so I learnt, for days together, to prevent\r\n  her from stripping herself of all she wears. Two women I saw there\r\n  myself, not three days ago, clad simply in nature’s garb, as naked as\r\n  when born. A patient of my own was taken to this comfortless place\r\n  some few months ago. His case wanted thoughtful care and instant\r\n  attention. Red tape, however, consumed weeks of valuable time, the\r\n  chance of cure was risked, and he, poor fellow, instead of being cared\r\n  for by skilled attendants, was thrust handcuffed into a cell,\r\n  ironically called padded, the floor left bare, on which he might have\r\n  battered out his brains, had he chosen, in the frenzy of his despair!\r\n  On another occasion, in that very same cell, a lunatic was confined\r\n  one night not very long before. Upon the jailer paying his visit in\r\n  the morning he looked anxiously round for the man that had been\r\n  committed to his care the previous evening. To his astonishment, where\r\n  do you think he found him? I will tell you. During the long, dreary\r\n  watches of the night, the poor fellow, to escape from some imaginary\r\n  foe, had scooped out with his nails a hole large and deep enough in\r\n  which to hide, and there he found him, crouching like a wild beast in\r\n  his lair. I saw this hole myself on a visit I afterward paid him. I\r\n  will here ask you one question, who ought to inquire into these\r\n  matters? Who is answerable for this shameful neglect?”\r\n\r\nThis account created quite a sensation, and was at once taken notice of\r\nby the government, who removed all but one lunatic, about whom there was\r\nsome local quibble, to the asylum at Grahamstown. Some idea may be\r\nformed of the responsibility falling upon the shoulders of the Governor\r\nof the Kimberley jail when I inform my readers that during the last\r\nfourteen years 67,000 convicted prisoners have passed through his hands.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would be incomplete without a few words respecting the\r\nclimate of Griqualand West. Taken as a whole it is very salubrious, and\r\nespecially adapted to those suffering from lung disease, as the country\r\nbeing almost entirely devoid of timber or vegetation permits free\r\ncurrents of air to prevail, a condition which is very favorable to\r\nconsumptive patients. Although the changes of temperature are very\r\nsudden and great, yet with proper care little harm is done, as the\r\nexcessive dryness of the soil and atmosphere enables the residents to\r\nwithstand with but little inconvenience a heat which would be quite\r\nunbearable in a moist climate. The rain, too, when it comes, generally\r\nfalls in sharp and heavy showers.\r\n\r\nThe drinking water is upon the whole good, though that of the deep wells\r\nis rather hard, and in the shallow ones brackish, but the water now\r\nbrought in from the Vaal River through the enterprise of Chevalier Lynch\r\nby means of pipes is soft and very wholesome.\r\n\r\nThe elevation of Griqualand West of about 4,000 feet above the sea\r\nappears to give it the air of a mountainous region, the ozone being\r\nconstant, and ranging from 3.5 to 9.5 degrees on a scale of ten, the\r\naverage being about five degrees.\r\n\r\nIn Kimberley the north wind is the prevailing one. From a report of\r\n4,452 observations taken by Mr. G. J. Lee, F. R. Met. S., in 1885, in\r\n681 cases it was due north; next in order came northeast and south\r\nwinds, of about equal frequency, and next, with comparatively little\r\ndifference, were winds from the northwest and southwest. As can be\r\nimagined Griqualand West is very dry.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the table below that there has been one year only\r\nduring the last nine in which the rainfall came up to or exceeded\r\ntwenty-five inches, which is about the English average: 1877, 13.58\r\ninches; 1878, 9.34; 1879, 19.38; 1880, 15.43; 1881, 30.30; 1882, 14.77;\r\n1883, 13.63; 1884, 20.46, and 73 days on which rain fell; 1885, 9.77,\r\nand 74 days on which rain fell.\r\n\r\nIn some months no rain falls at all. The following is a tabulated list\r\nof the months, during the last eight years, in which this has occurred:\r\nJune, 1877; June, 1878; October, 1879; July, 1880; August, 1880;\r\nSeptember, 1880; July, 1881; September, 1881; June, 1883; December,\r\n1883; July, 1884; August, 1884; July, 1885.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1885 there were ninety-two days on which lightning was\r\nseen, seventy-four on which dew fell, two hundred and eighty-eight days\r\non which there were clouds, and seven days on which ice was seen,\r\nalthough in the outskirts of Kimberley ice was much more frequent. I\r\nhave given monthly returns in the accompanying table:\r\n\r\n                  1885      Clouds    Dew Lightning Ice\r\n                January       27 days   1        10   0\r\n                February      26  „     7        20   0\r\n                March         26  „    21         4   0\r\n                April         24  „    16         5   0\r\n                May           23  „     9         1   0\r\n                June          13  „     9         1   0\r\n                July          17  „     1         0   0\r\n                August        25  „     4         3   6\r\n                September     26  „     5         5   1\r\n                October       27  „     1         8   0\r\n                November      26  „     0        15   0\r\n                December      28  „     0        20   0\r\n                             ———       ——        ——   —\r\n                             288       74        92   7\r\n\r\nThe barometric pressure for the year 1883 appears to have been at its\r\nmaximum in June, in which month the reading was 26.177 inches, and the\r\nminimum, which was 25.849 inches, occurred in January, while the mean\r\nfor the year was 25.988 inches. All these readings are corrected to 32°\r\nF.\r\n\r\nThe heat experienced in Griqualand West is sometimes very excessive,\r\nwhen I state that the maximum summer heat of the day in the shade during\r\nthe months of November and December was in the year 1883, 107°, in 1884,\r\n102°, and last year 104°, whilst during the month of December, 1885, the\r\nordinary bright bulb thermometer in the sun attained the height of\r\n116.25°, and the blackened bulb in vacuo 174.6°, my readers may form\r\nsome idea of the great range of temperature to which residents are\r\nexposed, especially if they contrast this with the minimum during the\r\nwinter months, July and August, of 26° in 1884, and of 28.25° in 1885.\r\nAt the same time it is interesting to note that the highest mean of\r\nabsolute maximum temperature was 78.98° in December and the absolute\r\nminimum 52.52° in June. I have often conversed on this subject with one\r\nof the early Vaal River diggers, who told me that in September, 1870, he\r\nseveral times found the thermometer in his tent in the early morning\r\nstanding at 32°, and at mid-day registering 112°, and on one occasion in\r\n1870 it was as low as 17°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KIMBERLEY MINE—MIDDLE STAGE, 1875.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the winter there is a great difference between the temperature upon\r\nthe grass and that upon the bare soil. Wagoners are fully aware of this,\r\nfor when on a cold, frosty night their oxen go astray, they look for\r\nthem upon roads, or bare patches of ground, as they know where the\r\ninstinct of the animals will lead them, the oxen appearing intuitively\r\nto know that the grass favors radiation and causes intense cold. I have\r\noften indeed known the temperature on the grass to be as low as 16°, or\r\neven 13°, when the temperature on the bare ground around was above\r\nfreezing point. Any one living near the diamond mines can relate the\r\nscores of cases in which natives during the last ten years have lain\r\ndown upon the veldt (grass) to sleep away their drunken carousals, and\r\nhave been found stiff and dead in the morning.\r\n\r\nAlthough “Afric’s sunny fountains” (comparatively few in number,\r\nhowever, on our high plateau) have, in good old Bishop Heber’s beautiful\r\nhymn, “rolled down their golden sand,” yet visitors who come out under\r\nthe belief that pajamas, mosquito nets, and the lightest silken\r\ngossamers, etc., are sufficient to keep out the cold, would be\r\nastonished to find, as they might do, from time to time, pea-jacketed\r\nand ulstered individuals of varying ages heartily enjoying games of\r\nsnowball under the supposed burning sun.\r\n\r\nThe dust storms, to which we are liable all the year round, are our\r\ngreatest trial, sweeping over the country like a very sirocco, burning,\r\nblinding and choking up everything in their fury. Occasionally, to\r\nchange the scene, we have storms of hail, with stones sometimes of\r\nextraordinary size, two and two and a half inches in diameter, whilst\r\nwhirlpools ofttimes sweep and circle round, to relieve the monotony of\r\nthe landscape.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding these drawbacks, and the great variations in the\r\nclimate, and putting aside preventible diseases, arising from defective\r\nsanitation, and reckless exposure, the climate is on the whole very\r\nfairly healthy for Europeans.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Fields the gambling spirit so infatuated many\r\nof the diggers, that, not satisfied with the excitement of the day’s\r\nluck, or ill-luck in the mine, they would prolong the accidents of\r\nfortune far into the night. In my next chapter I will give an account of\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n          GAMBLING AT THE DIAMOND FIELDS.—MR. DODD’S ADVICE ON\r\n    GAMBLING.—SPECULATIVE VALUE OF DIGGING.—THE FIELDS IN THE EARLY\r\n DAYS.—GAMBLING HELLS IN 1872.—MR. JONES “AT HOME.”—GOVERNOR SOUTHEY’S\r\n    PROCLAMATION.—EXODUS TO THE FREE STATE.—RONDO EN COLO.—COLLAPSE.\r\n\r\n  “Chance, my dear Bob, chance is ten times a more intoxicating liquor\r\n  than champagne, and, once take to ‘dramming’ with fortune, you may bid\r\n  a long adieu to sobriety! I do not speak here of the terrible\r\n  infatuation of play, and the almost utter impossibility of resisting\r\n  it, but I allude to what is infinitely worse—the certainty of your\r\n  applying play theories and play tactics to every event and\r\n  circumstance of real life.”—_James Dodd to Robert Doolan, Esq.—Lever._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Dodd’s advice upon the subject of play, and his contention as to\r\nits worst results be correct, and I think no one can fairly contradict\r\nhim, how much stronger is the position if the converse of the\r\nproposition be taken. The latter was the case, however, in the infancy\r\nof the diamond fields. There the daily work was one continual game at\r\nhazard with Dame Fortune. The “hard-up” and disconsolate digger of\r\nto-day might be Chance’s chosen favorite to-morrow. One blow of the\r\npick, one turn of the shovel, might disclose for him a treasure\r\nexceeding his wildest imaginings, the difference between the precarious\r\nbusiness of digging for diamonds and gambling at a faro table, in fact,\r\nbeing a moral difference only. Hence that hope which “springs eternal in\r\nthe human breast” buoyed him up under all difficulties and prevented his\r\never yielding to absolute despair. But at the same time it tended to\r\nweaken the force of his moral character; he was compelled by\r\ncircumstances to confront, and in a measure calculate upon, the chances,\r\nand probabilities of his daily avocations; he had to begin with that\r\nstate of mind in which Mr. Dodd’s gambler is supposed to finish; and\r\nthere is little ground, therefore, for surprise that, when turning from\r\nlabor to leisure, the digger’s favorite recreations should be those of\r\nthe gamester.\r\n\r\nHis surroundings, moreover, were depressing in the extreme. Even when\r\nmitigated by the company of a “chum,” tent life, upon mere bread and\r\nmeat, with indifferent coffee, and no rational amusements at command,\r\nwas not exhilarating. Is it wonderful, therefore, that the gregarious\r\ninstinct of man should have led the diggers to while away the dreariness\r\nof their idle hours at the hotels or gambling saloons? Even of happy\r\nEngland did not Shenstone say:\r\n\r\n                “Whoe’er has traveled life’s dull round,\r\n                  Whate’er his stages may have been,\r\n                Must sigh to think he still has found\r\n                  His warmest welcome at an inn?”\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly, in all mining camps, the two great social evils have\r\nalways been drinking and gambling. The diamond fields were not singular\r\nin this respect, for the digger only followed the example of his\r\nAustralian and Californian brother when he allowed his appetite for\r\ndrink and his passion for play to run riot. The canteens and gambling\r\nsaloons supplied the opportunities, and on the principle of “vires\r\nacquirit eundo”—reached such dire proportions as to call for legislative\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nOf the evils of the drink traffic I may speak elsewhere. With regard to\r\nthe other social evil I may mention that it first took firm hold of the\r\ncommunity by the establishment of a saloon under the auspices of two\r\npartners, who had discarded the legitimate but slower processes of their\r\nordinary digging operations for the more rapid if less regular method of\r\nmaking a fortune over “the board of green cloth.” There were many\r\nothers, who all ran the game openly, engaged in this nefarious\r\noccupation, but I select these men, as they probably made the largest\r\nfortune in their business, if such it may be called, retiring in a few\r\nmonths with £40,000. The games most in vogue at this “hell” were\r\n“roulette,” “rouge-et-noir,” “trente-et-quarante” and “faro,” all of\r\nwhich, I must admit, were conducted in a perfectly honorable manner, and\r\nthe legitimate odds invariably given the players. On the other hand the\r\nsmaller fry of the hell-keepers descended to very low dodges indeed. One\r\n_modest_ young man who kept a roulette table had four “zeros” and a\r\n“crown and feather” for himself, with thirty-six numbers for his\r\npatrons, whilst he would lay only thirty to one against any individual\r\nnumber, thus securing for himself in any event an advantage of some\r\nthirty-three per cent. upon each spin of the table, if luck were in\r\nother respects even. Another gentleman (?), by mechanical devices, as\r\nactually robbed his patrons as if he had knocked them down and rifled\r\ntheir pockets. This thief had the alternate divisions between the colors\r\non his revolving ribbed wheel of fortune so contrived that he could\r\ndirect the ball, by a right or left spin, on to such color as might suit\r\nhis pocket best. I also heard of a still bolder spirit, who, becoming\r\nalarmed at the constancy with which one player persisted in backing the\r\nnumber 13, quietly called in the painter’s art to erase the dangerous\r\nfigure and paint a second 31. He then allowed the player, who must have\r\nbeen strangely short-sighted, to continue backing his favorite number\r\n“13” for some nights afterward, no doubt looking upon this man’s\r\ninfatuation as a certain annuity, before the fraud was discovered. This\r\nwas “heads I win and tails you lose” with a vengeance for the banker.\r\nThere were other devices which it is unnecessary for me to refer to\r\nhere, but which all tended to increase the odds against the players.\r\n\r\nLet me give a sketch of one eventful evening in a gambling saloon of the\r\nolden days: We approached a corrugated iron building of no great\r\narchitectural pretensions, from whence came sounds of lively music and\r\nthe hum of many voices alternating with an almost complete stillness,\r\nwhich was broken only by the ominous croak of the croupier or the\r\nreckless oaths of the losers. Upon entering we encountered an individual\r\n(technically called a “bonnet”) whose hateful duty it was to tempt men\r\nto play by the lavish way in which he staked money which to all\r\nappearance was his own, and to seduce the unwary into the meshes of his\r\nemployer’s net. On this occasion I recollect the proprietor of the hell,\r\nno doubt urged on by an ardent thirst for gold, but who, however, was\r\nexceedingly anxious to preserve his incognito, passing himself off as an\r\nactive business agent in claim matters, actually acting as a bonnet at\r\nhis own “hell;” losing and winning hundreds with the greatest\r\nnonchalance. His manner was cheerful in the extreme, and as the night\r\nwas yet young, the players scanty and the stakes small, he was free to\r\ninveigle our humble selves into play.\r\n\r\nWith a princely air, which ill became his vulgar exterior, he called for\r\nchampagne, which we declined to drink, preferring to take a modest glass\r\nof spirits. He then politely offered other refreshments of a more solid\r\nnature, which we also refused, and finally suggested that we should\r\n“watch a game.” He declined to receive the payment that we offered, so\r\nled by curiosity we turned our attention to the tables, which by this\r\ntime were surrounded by an eager throng of players. A motley crew they\r\nwere, indeed. Old men and boys, the inveterate and apparently unmoved\r\ngambler and the nervous and manifestly excited tyro; the honest and\r\ndishonest, the mean and generous, the cowardly and brave; all classes\r\nwere there. Some clad in decent clothes, but many in shirt sleeves and\r\nrough garb, just as they had come from the mine, had notes of large\r\namounts in their hands, whilst bundles of them protruded from their\r\npockets. Some again had but little money, and staked warily, frequently\r\nreferring to the state of their finances; others had no funds at all,\r\nand simply looked on from sheer infatuation, having nothing, staking\r\nnothing, neither winning nor losing, but meddling and advising\r\nbystanders as to the best form and chance of play, until significantly\r\nwarned by an attendant to keep silence. All, however, were beset by the\r\n“auri sacra fames,” and flocked like sheep round the croupier’s table,\r\nwhere it was not until after much crushing and grumbling that a\r\nnew-comer who had evidently some considerable money to sacrifice at Dame\r\nFortune’s shrine was admitted to the charmed circle. He was addressed as\r\nCaptain H. by surrounding friends, and we watched his play with\r\nconsiderable interest, as despite a calm exterior his anxiety to win was\r\nevidently most intense. Play continued with varying success for some\r\ntime, until his rolls having dwindled away, it seemed that H. had come\r\ndown to his last £10 note. This he flung on the “red” with a look of\r\nsheer despair, and awaited the issue with an agony of expression that\r\nwas painful to witness. “Red” would have proved his salvation, but alas!\r\nonce more “black” was in the ascendant, and H. was “played out.” With a\r\nmuttered oath, but without any words intelligible to the bystanders, he\r\ndarted outside the saloon into the open. Those absorbed in play merely\r\njeered at his sudden departure; their hearts had become hardened to such\r\nscenes, but even to their callous temperaments came a sudden sickening\r\nchill as the report of a pistol rang out clearly through the midnight\r\nair. Their unspoken thoughts found language as a chance passer-by\r\nexcitedly rushed in, telling them that Captain H. had shot himself and\r\nwas lying smothered in blood, dead in the road. It was too true. H. had\r\nsolved life’s mysteries by one mad act, and had added another name to\r\nthe long death-roll of fickle Fortune’s victims!\r\n\r\nShortly after this the laws against gambling were altered and rendered\r\nmuch more stringent by a government proclamation signed by Richard\r\nSouthey and dated, 17th March 1873.\r\n\r\nPrior to this, however, and whilst the gambling hells were in full\r\nswing, there had been rusting in the legal armory of the government a\r\nweapon which surely ought to have been sufficient to deal to some extent\r\nwith the gambling nuisance. On June 2d, 1872, the government had already\r\nrecognized the extent and growth of this evil, and with a view of\r\nlessening it, I find that the commissioners issued a notice, which was\r\npublished in the _Gazette_, prohibiting lotteries and fining offenders\r\ntwenty-five rix dollars over and above the forfeiture of the property\r\nplayed for, with an alternative of being severely flogged. Tavern\r\nkeepers and publicans who had broken the act were also forever precluded\r\nfrom holding licenses. This latter notice caused the hell-keepers and\r\ntheir patrons to observe more caution, but it was merely an improvement\r\non the surface, for the former speedily constituted so-called “clubs,”\r\nwhere gambling went on as freely as ever. A notice such as the following\r\n\r\n+------------------------------------------------+\r\n|                 Barkly House,                  |\r\n|                                                |\r\n|       _BEHIND MRS.

The digging camps being close to the\r\nOrange Free State border, arrangements were made with the owner of\r\nWessel’s farm, which is some six miles from Du Toit’s Pan, and in the\r\nFree State, to continue operations there. This is the locality which\r\nafterward became so notorious as a sort of harbor of refuge and base of\r\noperations for the illicit diamond trade of Griqualand West. To this\r\nrural retreat were transported roulette wheels and other gambling\r\nimplements, and play was there recommenced, but without much success.\r\nMen who might succumb to temptation when it was thrust under their very\r\nnoses were not weak or wicked enough to make active search for it; so\r\nthe suburban “hell” died a natural death.\r\n\r\nYour professional gamblers are, however, very pertinacious men, and\r\nwhilst casting about for a new idea they decided to introduce “rondo en\r\ncolo,” a game which combined the simplicity of “pitch and toss” with a\r\ncapability for investing an unlimited amount of money. It had the\r\nfurther merit, moreover, of being an absolute certainty for the banker.\r\nIn the other games which had previously been the fashion there was\r\nalways a chance, though a tolerably remote one, of breaking the bank,\r\nor, at least, of winning greater or less sums from the establishment,\r\nbut in “rondo en colo” all this was changed. The hawk had been forbidden\r\nto prey upon the doves, so he set the latter on to pluck each other,\r\nwhilst he seized upon the feathers.\r\n\r\nThe _modus operandi_ was as follows: The banker or croupier, who at this\r\ngame required little or no capital, having secured the use of a billiard\r\ntable, seated himself opposite to one of the middle pockets, and spread\r\nout upon the table in front of himself a semicircular piece of\r\noil-cloth, upon the edge of which were painted the numbers one to eight,\r\nand certain other marks and combinations peculiar to the game. A round\r\nstick like a large ruler was provided, by which eight glass balls were\r\npropelled in an even line from one of the end pockets to its diagonal\r\nopposite at the other end of the table, and the stakes were won or lost\r\naccording to the manner in which the balls were deposited in or near to\r\nthe object pocket. One of the bystanders would stake say five pounds on\r\nthe oil-cloth with a view of betting either on the number of balls that\r\nwould run into the object pocket, or as to whether that number would be\r\nodd or even. If another bystander felt inclined to take up the bet he\r\ncovered the stakes by placing an equal amount on the billiard cloth\r\nopposite to the sum already deposited upon the board. If the money were\r\nnot covered there was no bet made. When a sufficient number of couples\r\nhad backed their opinions the balls were rolled to the object pocket,\r\nthe stakes were awarded according to the event, and last, but not least\r\nof all, the stakes were handed over to the winner by the banker, who,\r\nhowever, carefully deducted his five per cent, on the cast.\r\n\r\nOf science there was none, the bank was sure to win. In fact if some\r\nunfortunate wight had the good fortune to win £100 for say twenty times,\r\nand then had ill-luck enough to back a losing event for £100 for twenty\r\ntimes following, the banker’s commissions of five per cent. would have\r\nswallowed up an amount exceeding the capital with which he commenced.\r\nThis combination of safety and simplicity for the banker, however,\r\nfailed to convince the authorities as to either the fairness or the\r\nlegality of the game, and accordingly one busy evening when the game was\r\nin full blast, a tall, gaunt figure, with eagle eye and Roman nose, well\r\nknown to all old residents on the Fields at the time, although since\r\ndead, suddenly came down upon the gamblers like “a wolf on the fold,”\r\nseizing all the money and dispersing the men, taking the proprietor into\r\ncustody.\r\n\r\nCurses both loud and deep greeted this summary proceeding, but it was\r\nall of no avail. The law took its course, a prosecution followed, at\r\nwhich divers ingenious arguments were raised for the defence by the late\r\nMr. T. Mortimer Siddall, a most able lawyer, but all to no purpose. The\r\nnew proclamation was so stringently worded as to preclude all loopholes\r\nof escape; every possible legal presumption was evidently to be\r\nconstrued against the accused; and a conviction and the heavy fine of\r\n£300 followed. This tolled the death-knell of public gambling at the\r\nDiamond Fields.\r\n\r\nThe prosecution could not, however, stop private gambling, nor in fact\r\nis such a desirable result practicable, for since the publication of the\r\nnew law I have heard of very high play taking place. But though I have\r\nsince known hundreds and occasionally thousands of pounds to change\r\nhands in private houses, the gambling nuisance is no longer flaunted\r\nbefore sober and respectable citizens, or what is of more importance,\r\nunder the very eyes of those feebly pliant mortals who yield to the\r\nslightest solicitations of the gambling ogre.\r\n\r\nThe class of “wasters” which public gambling bred and fostered were a\r\ndistinct outrage upon society. How could an honest and industrious but\r\nunlucky digger fail to draw invidious comparisons between his own hard\r\nlot and the “purple and fine linen” style of life which apparently\r\nmarked the “rake’s progress” of the professed gambler? Had not some such\r\nproclamation been issued, I feel confident that episodes like that\r\nrelated in Bret Harte’s “Outcasts of Poker Flat” might have marked the\r\nprogress of the fields, though I doubt whether any of the gamblers of\r\nthat time would have compared very favorably with “John Oakhurst,\r\ngentleman.” The legitimate diamond industry afforded ample scope for the\r\nmost enthusiastic speculator, and there was no need of any adventitious\r\naid to add to the uncertainties of digging life.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter I may just draw attention to the fact that a new\r\nscheme, the “totalisator,” inciting and encouraging gambling on the\r\nSouth African race-courses has been introduced (1885). This, though it\r\nprotects backers of horses from levanting bookmakers, and affords the\r\ncurrent and proper odds on each race, ought at once to be stopped.[22]\r\nIts very existence proves the truth of the old saying that “one man may\r\nsteal a horse, while another dare not look in at the stable door.”\r\n\r\nI may further relate, in order to show the harm which legalized\r\nlotteries do to the moral tone of a community, that at the spring\r\nmeeting, 1885, of the Griqualand West Turf Club, a thousand pound\r\nlottery was so rapidly subscribed that a second was started and filled\r\nalmost at once, the club receiving 10 per cent. of the winner’s money.\r\nAt the Capetown autumn meeting in 1886 a somewhat similar lottery was\r\nstarted, when a well-known Kimberley gentleman chanced to draw the\r\nfavorite, and the news of his luck soon spread. Judge of his surprise on\r\nreceiving a telegram from the horse’s owner, a supposed honorable man,\r\nto the following effect: “My horse sure of a place, will you give a\r\nthird of prize? Otherwise I shall scratch him.” The Kimberley gentleman\r\ndid not see his way to accede to this modest request, and preferred,\r\nmuch to the disgust of the too astute owner, to publish his telegram in\r\nboth the Kimberley and Capetown newspapers. This course of action caused\r\nthe question of the legality of these race lotteries to be raised in\r\nparliament, but the premier’s reply at the time was considered to be\r\nvague, and was severely commented upon by the press of the colony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\nO’REILLY’S ACCOUNT OF NIEKERK.—DR. ATHERSTONE AND THE FIRST DIAMOND.—THE\r\nRIVER DIGGINGS.—INFLUX OF POPULATION.—THE DRY DIGGINGS.—DISCOVERY OF THE\r\nKIMBERLEY MINE.—EARLY DISCOMFORTS OF THE DIGGERS.— PRESENT CONDITION OF\r\n                               KIMBERLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is already a matter of history how in 1867 the first diamond was\r\ndiscovered in South Africa—not in the bed of a river or in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, but among the playthings of a Boer’s child in a farm-house\r\nnear the Orange River in the Hopetown district.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how—to slightly alter Pope—“great events from\r\ntrivial causes spring.” In the same manner that the discovery of\r\ndiamonds in Brazil and the opening up of the mines in that country\r\nvirtually closed the Indian mines, so the diamond mines of Griqualand\r\nWest have almost put a stop to the Brazilian trade.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain spice of romance about the story of the finding of\r\nthe first diamond in South Africa, as told to me by a former patient of\r\nmine, Mr. John O’Reilly, who was the principal agent interested in the\r\ndiscovery, and who thus achieved for himself a historic name in\r\nconnection with the development of South Africa. I took down from his\r\nown lips the following graphic account of the finding of this gem, which\r\ndiffers in some particulars from the version that has been frequently\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KIMBERLEY MINE—PRESENT STAGE, 1886.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “It is nine years ago, you know, Doctor,” he said, “since I first lit\r\n  upon the diamond which led to the finding and development of this\r\n  wonderful place. I was trading around as usual, never dreaming of\r\n  anything particular occurring, when in October, 1867, I outspanned at\r\n  a farm belonging to a Boer named Niekerk, close to the Orange River.\r\n  His youngsters, when I came there, were playing with pebbles just like\r\n  the ‘alleytors and commoners’ beloved by Master Bardell in Pickwick,\r\n  and their father was standing alongside watching them. Seeing me\r\n  looking on, he pointed out one stone prettier than the rest in the\r\n  hand of a little Griqua servant boy who was minding his children, and\r\n  said: ‘Dars a mooi klippe voor en borst spelt’ (there’s a pretty stone\r\n  for a woman’s brooch). I had a diamond ring on my finger, and I\r\n  fancied I could see some resemblance to the cut stone; and taking it\r\n  from the boy I tried to scratch my initials on the window pane, as I\r\n  had somewhere seen that this was one of the tests of a diamond. As\r\n  soon as I found that the stone would cut glass I offered to give\r\n  Niekerk, if he would allow me to take it away, one-half of what I\r\n  might get for it, supposing it proved to be a diamond. This he jumped\r\n  at. I at once inspanned my oxen into my wagon, and went to Hopetown,\r\n  our trading centre at that time. When I got there I showed it to\r\n  Solomon, the store-keeper, you must know him, who chaffed me and\r\n  laughing bet me a dozen of beer that it wasn’t worth anything, and\r\n  that I must be an utter idiot to bother about such a mare’s nest. From\r\n  Hopetown I trekked on to Colesberg, where I took another opinion. I\r\n  asked the resident magistrate this time. He wasn’t sure what it was,\r\n  but advised me to send it to Capetown. I didn’t care, however, to do\r\n  that, so I sent it to Grahamstown instead, where Dr. Atherstone lived,\r\n  who knows all about such things. When I arrived there myself shortly\r\n  afterward and saw him he said there was no doubt it was a diamond, and\r\n  a good one too. Dr. Atherstone sent it to Sir Philip Wodehouse, then\r\n  Governor, who bought it for £500, half of which I gave, as promised,\r\n  to Niekerk.\r\n\r\n  “You ask me how Dr. Atherstone found out what it was. Well, I’ll tell\r\n  you what Dr. Atherstone told me. He said he took the stone round to\r\n  all the jewelers in Grahamstown, and that their files couldn’t touch\r\n  it; and this with something about specific gravity I didn’t at that\r\n  time understand, made him feel certain it was a diamond. The discovery\r\n  created an enormous sensation? You are right, it did; and if it had\r\n  not been for that little bit of luck on the Orange River, diamond\r\n  digging in Africa might still be unknown, and the country would never\r\n  have made the progress it has.\r\n\r\n  “When people in the colony began to think that there was a chance of\r\n  more diamonds being found where this one came from, numerous parties\r\n  of fortune hunters came up and began to search along the banks of the\r\n  Orange River, and afterward those of the Vaal. This is the way that\r\n  the first diggers came here.”\r\n\r\nIt is now seventeen years ago since Mr. Southey, then colonial\r\nsecretary, laid the second diamond which had been found, on the table of\r\nthe House of the Cape assembly, with the prophetic remark: “Gentlemen,\r\nthis is the rock on which the future success of South Africa will be\r\nbuilt.” There is not a man who knows this gentleman but rejoices that he\r\nstill lives, ripe in years, to see the continued fulfillment of his\r\nremarkable prediction.\r\n\r\nTo cross the Orange River in those days was to go beyond the confines of\r\ncivilization; but the diamond is a wonderful magnet, and as the news\r\nspread a large population of many thousands soon collected. The influx,\r\nas time went on, became of the most cosmopolitan character, North,\r\nSouth, East and West adding their quota, gold diggers came from the\r\ngulches of California and the creeks of Australia, “Cousin Jacks” from\r\nCornwall, diamond buyers and speculators from London, Paris and\r\nAmsterdam, “tinkers, tailors, soldiers, sailors, ploughboys,\r\napothecaries and thieves,” eager at all cost to embrace this chance of\r\nsudden wealth. Hardships were endured, money risked, labor spent. Some\r\nwere lucky, others unlucky. The life on the river, however, is spoken of\r\nby the “old hands” as one of happy memory. I should think that thirty\r\ndifferent sites were “rushed” by the early diggers on the Vaal,[23] and\r\nalthough Pinel and Klipdrift were the principal, yet the banks of the\r\nriver for at least seventy miles of its course were more or less\r\nprospected and worked. As I will presently show, the river diggings\r\nafter the discovery of diamonds at Du Toit’s Pan and the other three\r\nmines became rapidly deserted, until at the present time there are not\r\nmore than 400 diggers altogether on the banks. The diggings are all in\r\nalluvial soil. No great finds are made. The diggers, however, enjoy a\r\nhealthy, happy existence, surrounded by the beauties of nature, on the\r\nbanks of a broad and majestic river, which in the early days bore on its\r\nbroad bosom a perfect flotilla of ferry boats plying for hire day and\r\nnight, and which even now, on the birthday of our beloved queen and\r\nother public holidays, may be seen in goodly numbers, with “youth at the\r\nprow and pleasure at the helm,” a very different form of life from the\r\ndust and discomfort of the dry diggings. The returns from these diggings\r\nare at present about £50,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nWhile men were busily engaged in scraping away among the pebbles of the\r\nVaal River, _prospecting_ was going on some twenty miles southward. The\r\nfirst dry diggings struck were those of Du Toit’s Pan in the middle of\r\n1870, which were worked chiefly by the Dutch, who at that time never\r\nthought of testing the ground to a greater depth than eighteen inches or\r\ntwo feet, and who, when they came upon calcareous tufa, abandoned their\r\noperations. Shortly afterward, on the adjoining farm, Bulfontein, and\r\nwithin gunshot range of Du Toit’s Pan, diamonds were found in the very\r\nplaster which lined the walls of the homestead. Hearing this, many\r\ndiggers moved over from Du Toit’s Pan and proved the diamondiferous\r\ncharacter of this farm, the returns from which, however, were found not\r\nto be equal to those of the former place, while a month or two later\r\nanother diggings named Old De Beers, and situated about a couple of\r\nmiles north of Du Toit’s Pan, were also opened up. An occurrence which\r\nhas proved of absorbing interest to the whole of South Africa took place\r\nabout this time. In July a young man of the name of Rawstorne, who came\r\nup from Colesberg in the Cape Colony, was out shooting, and becoming\r\nsomewhat weary, rested himself under the shades of a thorn bush, and\r\nscratching the ground, from, force of habit and to pass the time away,\r\nunearthed a beautiful diamond. Highly elated with his unexpected\r\nsuccess, when he returned after his day’s amusement to his friends at\r\nOld De Beers, he told them of his luck. Next day, the news having got\r\nabroad, the locality was “rushed” and hundreds of claims pegged out. The\r\nother diggings very soon became practically deserted. Men packed up\r\ntheir belongings, moved their tents, and sought the “New Rush,” and,\r\nalmost as if by magic, in the very place where but a few days before\r\ndeer had been quietly browsing, hundreds of diggers could be seen. This\r\nfamous “Kopje” is now the Kimberley mine, the richness of which it is\r\nimpossible to estimate. When this mine was first opened the claims were\r\nlaid out in an oblong of 30 from north to south and 28 from east to\r\nwest, making in all upon the original plan 840 claims of 30 feet square\r\n(Rhynland measure), giving 961 English square feet to each claim. After\r\nthe whole of the claims were measured and given out, hundreds of others\r\nwere marked off and worked. Some were very soon abandoned as worthless,\r\nbut others equally worthless were worked, the owners for some time\r\nhoping that a change for the better would take place, and that they\r\nwould become remunerative. These extended far into the present site of\r\nthe township, and much valuable time was lost in testing them.\r\n\r\nAt the present time out of the 420 claims originally worked 339⅕ only\r\nremain, and the holdings by various diggers, which at that time amounted\r\nto over 1,100, are now reduced to twenty-two companies and individuals.\r\nIn the same manner Old De Beers with its 592, Du Toit’s Pan with its\r\n1,417, and Bulfontein with its 799 claims, are represented by 6, 34, and\r\n21 holdings respectively.[24]\r\n\r\nNo more wretched existence can be imagined than that endured by the\r\nearly diggers. As I have already mentioned, a malarial fever raged,\r\nwater was dear and bad, being carted in barrels from adjacent farms,\r\n(after even wells were dug it was sold for as much as 10s. per barrel)\r\nand so scarce that I have seen diggers wash in soda water which had been\r\nimported 700 miles from Capetown. Vegetables were also extremely dear\r\nand almost unprocurable, cauliflowers being retailed at 20s. each and\r\ncabbages at 8s., fleas and flies abounded, sand-storms blew in blind\r\nfury, and of amusements there were none; yet notwithstanding all these\r\ndrawbacks, sociability ruled throughout the camps, and a helping hand\r\nwas always thrown out by a lucky digger to assist his less fortunate\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nCrime was nearly unknown. As I have mentioned elsewhere, the fields were\r\ntoo far inland and the cost of travel too great to induce any not\r\nhonestly inclined to suffer the privations and incur the expense\r\nnecessary to get there. Men would leave their tents for hours, even\r\ndays, and yet find everything intact on their return, such was the quiet\r\nand order which reigned through the camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DRYING FLOOR FOR BLUE GROUND, CENTRAL COMPANY, KIMBERLEY MINE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut as time went on, and as transport became easier, cheaper and\r\nquicker, the fields became the rendezvous of, I should say, nearly all\r\nthe light-fingered gentry and desperadoes that Africa contained; and as\r\na consequence instances of illicit diamond buying, robberies and\r\nassaults became comparatively numerous, in fact Kimberley became\r\n“civilized.”\r\n\r\nAt the present day churches and chapels, a theatre and library, a\r\nmunicipal council, with a mayor, a properly drilled police force, a\r\nwell-kept cemetery, the electric light, a race-course and grand stand,\r\npublic gardens, with tastefully laid out grounds, an admirably arranged\r\nand conducted hospital for whites and blacks, a noble court of justice,\r\na comfortably arranged post-office, telegraphic office, and other public\r\nbuildings, with last, but not least, a large railway station (which for\r\nthe present is the terminus of the iron way to the interior), are\r\nmanifestations of the strides which, thanks to the discovery of the\r\ndiamond, civilization has made in a region which a few short years ago\r\nwas simply the hunting field of the untutored savage or the nomadic\r\nboer. Barkly, which I have already mentioned, Hebron, Likatlong,\r\nBoetsap, Douglas and Campbell are the other towns of the territory,\r\nthough the Langeberg and some other parts are inhabited; but the\r\ndescription of a late writer that “they are poor—are almost\r\nwaterless—the trading and mission stations occupied as a rule by the\r\nmost depraved of the human race, things whose language is a curse or a\r\nclick, whose forms are inferior to those of apes, and whose doom is\r\nextinction,” is perhaps a little too severe on the aborigines of this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n GEOLOGY OF THE MINE AND SURROUNDINGS.—SECTION OF REEF STRATA.—SURFACE\r\n    SOIL.—CALCAREOUS TUFA.—LIGHT COLORED SHALES.—BLACK CARBONIFEROUS\r\nSHALE.—LIMONITE.

MASKELYNE AND FLIGHT’S OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny work dealing with Kimberley would be incomplete that did not treat\r\nof the geology of the mine. For many years I have had the pleasure of an\r\nintimate acquaintance with Mr. George J. Lee, who has made the\r\nmineralogy of the Kimberley mine his special study, and who has been, as\r\nI have already mentioned, in Kimberley since the mine opened. To his\r\nkindness I am indebted for most of the information and for the drawings\r\nin the two following chapters.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these I propose to give an account of the geological\r\nformation, not only inside, but also as revealed by shafts sunk by the\r\nKimberley mining board and the Central and French companies, outside the\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the lowest working, either within or without the mine, is\r\nnow about 550 feet, whilst that of the deepest trial shaft is 620 feet.\r\n\r\nA section of the strata in the Mining Board shaft, about 700 feet from\r\nthe north side of the mine, I will now describe, which strata, I may\r\ntell my readers, vary very little at any point in the vicinity, so far\r\nat least as is shown by the examination of the other shafts.\r\n\r\nThe surface soil, which has an average depth of six feet, is a bright\r\nred ferruginous sand, composed of somewhat fine rounded grains of\r\nquartz. Next a thin layer of calcareous tufa is found in some places,\r\nbut not invariably; then follows a layer of laminated trap or blue whin,\r\nevidently an intrusive rock varying in thickness and depth in different\r\nlocalities. This layer, which is of a very decomposed and friable\r\ncharacter, runs down diagonally in some parts, in broad sheets through\r\nthe blue shale. A very even layer of light colored shales, on an average\r\ntwenty-five feet thick and very soapy to the touch, comes next. These\r\nshales are of various colors, as pale bluish white, olive, yellow, gray,\r\netc., and the laminæ are often thickly marked with different designs\r\nformed by decomposed iron, probably pyrites. Some of these markings are\r\nvery delicate and beautiful, often resembling minute ferns or _algæ_,\r\nand in this bed various fossils have been found.\r\n\r\nBeneath these we have a vast layer of blackish, or neutral tint,\r\ncarboniferous shale, containing four or five seams of “iron band” (bog\r\niron ore, or limonite) from one inch to one foot in thickness. The\r\nnodules forming these “bands” are very full of cavities, and are of\r\ndifferent colors, yellow, red, and blue, with a dull appearance and\r\nrather soft. In some specimens the colors are beautifully bright,\r\nespecially in the cavities. Many fossils have been found in this shale\r\nas well at all depths.\r\n\r\nVery many nodules of a similar shale, but harder, varying in size from\r\nan inch to one or two feet in diameter, are found imbedded in this rock,\r\nor “main reef” as the miners term it, in contradistinction to “floating\r\nreef,” an erratic rock which will be mentioned when we come to describe\r\nthe diamondiferous ground. These nodules often assume the forms of casts\r\nof shells, such as those of oysters, mussels, etc., and give the idea\r\nthat the main body of the reef was formed from the grinding down of an\r\nolder rock, of which these nodules are the remains, an assumption which\r\nthere is much further internal evidence to show in all probability to be\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well here to mention that all the above shales, after\r\ndrying by exposure to the air, disintegrate and form a fine friable\r\nmould, or even mud after much rain has fallen. This property of becoming\r\nfriable after exposure is the cause of the frequency of “land slips”\r\nfalling into the mine. When a fall or slip does take place, the bulk of\r\nsuch mass is usually in very small pieces, not in large solid blocks,\r\nwhich would be the case if the reef were not of a nature so extremely\r\nrotten and easily decomposed.\r\n\r\nWhen these shales have been much exposed to the weather and the rain has\r\npenetrated to some depth, or when after a fall of rain upon friable reef\r\nthis is covered up by another slip, a very interesting chemical process\r\nis set up, viz.: the decomposition of the iron pyrites which is very\r\nplentifully distributed throughout the black shales. This decomposition\r\nsets up such an intense combustion that the shale _débris_ becomes red\r\nhot. This combustion I have known to last for months, even years, and\r\nthe sulphurous acid gas evolved to be so plentiful that in damp weather\r\nor before and after sunrise it could be seen for many miles. To\r\nstrangers looking into the mine this “burning reef” is a very startling\r\nsight, and many visitors of a superstitious turn of mind have often\r\nprecipitately left in affright, on being jokingly told by miners when\r\nthe latter were questioned about the heat, smoke and pungent sulphur\r\nsmells—that the “Old Gentleman” was trying to break loose, or that they\r\nhad come so near the “Old Gentleman” that he was now showing his anger.\r\nThis and similar stories have often sufficed to scare away simple\r\nfarmers from the place.\r\n\r\nOn many parts of the reef the surface becomes heated to such an extent\r\nthat articles placed upon it are almost at once destroyed. Laborers\r\ncannot work upon it at all without thick boots, and these even are\r\ndestroyed in a few hours, while in many cases natives cannot by any\r\ninducement be persuaded to go near.\r\n\r\nThe sudden combustion of coal in ships is caused by the very same\r\nagents, moisture and insufficient ventilation. These set up chemical\r\nchange in the iron pyrites contained in the coal, and thus cause the\r\nexplosions or fires at sea of which we frequently hear. This process of\r\nnature for reducing the iron pyrites is daily being imitated by the\r\nsmelters in Spain and other countries, in the preliminary process for\r\nthe reduction of the sulphur in copper ores, or copper pyrites.\r\n\r\nSome of the crystals of iron pyrites found in the reef shale are so very\r\nbeautiful and perfect that they have been set in pins and other\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nAfter the black shale reef has been ignited by the above chemical means,\r\nand has cooled, it is as red as an ordinary clay flower-pot. It may be\r\nthat the promoters of a brick company that was started here for the\r\npurpose of manufacturing bricks from the shales of the Kimberley mine,\r\ntook their idea from the appearance of the shales when thus burnt by\r\nnature. The bricks made from reef, after being pounded and ground by\r\nheavy steam machinery, were latterly turned out of a very good quality,\r\nbut the company collapsed, probably because they could not sell enough\r\nbricks to make it pay, as the high price of fuel rendered it necessary\r\nto charge £11, 10s. per 1,000, a nearly prohibitive price for ordinary\r\nbuilding work.[25]\r\n\r\nI may here mention that several narrow streaks of coal varying from an\r\ninch up to one of eight inches in thickness, discovered in the French\r\nshaft, have been found in the black shale. This coal partakes of the\r\nnature both of anthracitic and bituminous coal, the former quality\r\npredominating, but I may say, that even if it were found in quantity, it\r\nwould only be suitable for specially constructed furnaces, as it is very\r\nrefractory.\r\n\r\nNo “structure” or organic remains have been discovered in any specimen\r\nof coal found in the reef of which I am aware, but many coal plants have\r\nbeen found in the reef itself, and specimens have been deposited in\r\nvarious museums.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the olive-colored shales of the reef at the southeast of\r\nthe mine very frequently cracked, making great fissures at the surface.\r\nThese often remained open for months and even years, until the whole\r\nmass of reef which was thus detached from the main body, gradually slid\r\ndown to a solid bearing. In doing so, when the moving mass was heavy\r\nenough, the pressure upon the particles of rock within the fissure was\r\nso great that a fine, smooth and shiny face or a light gray color was\r\nmade, entering many feet, with streaks or grooves running down,\r\nglistening and lustrous, the prismatic colors of which could then be\r\nseen for weeks together if viewed from a suitable position. When seen to\r\nadvantage the sight was really charming, and could never be forgotten by\r\nthose who had the good fortune to view it. But the first shower of rain\r\nwould disintegrate the striated face of the rock, and by this means\r\ndestroy the beautiful play of light described.\r\n\r\nIn the drives and deep workings in the black shale the miners are\r\ntroubled both with fire-damp and choke-damp, and many accidents, more or\r\nless serious, have occurred therefrom through their ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe black shale is water bearing, and wells sunk in it to a depth of\r\neighty feet or more yield in most cases a good supply.\r\n\r\nI have, I think, for the present done with the sedimentary formations,\r\nand come now to the igneous rocks below them.\r\n\r\nThe first rock under the black shale gone through, as shown in the\r\ndiagram, is a light gray volcanic rock, three feet thick, with a\r\nspecific gravity of 2.815. The body of the rock is of a light bluish\r\ngray color, and contains beside other minerals nodules of quartz, agates\r\nand jasper, from the size of a mustard seed to that of a walnut.\r\n\r\nNext is found eight feet of a compact augitic or hornblendic rock, of a\r\ndeeper gray color and very tough, then a seamy rock resembling basaltic\r\ntrap, which was only worked to a depth of four feet in the shaft shown\r\nin the section, but is of unknown depth, for, since the Mining Board\r\nshaft was abandoned, others have been sunk, one by the French company,\r\nand another to a depth of 620 feet by the Central company, and they both\r\nare still in this same rock.\r\n\r\nThis rock contains very numerous nodules of quartz (amygdaloidal), some\r\nof which are split into flakes, and others completely fractured. Many of\r\nthese are white in color and semi-opaque; others have a red skin\r\n(jasper), with transparent white quartz within, while others are\r\nentirely red. There are also many small, dead grain-like nodules of a\r\nwhite color, as well as ribbon and other agates. In some of the deeper\r\nportions of this rock are many small fissures, presenting somewhat the\r\nappearance of having been caused by shrinkage; these, in most cases, are\r\ndistinct from each other, and are filled with white crystallized\r\ncalcite, or carbonate of lime. Some of the layers of this rock vary in\r\ncolor, and a very compact fine-grained specimen of a reddish color\r\ncontains amongst other minerals rhombic crystallized carbonate of lime,\r\nwhite; very brilliant iron pyrites, and a mineral looking very much like\r\ngalena, but harder, of a dark steel gray color, very brilliant, and\r\neasily separated into small cubes and laminæ. This is probably specular\r\niron ore. Another mineral has also been found in small quantities,\r\nrunning in veins in the stone, which upon the top appears as having been\r\nfused and run, like tin or lead. It is sectile, and of the color of pale\r\nbell metal. Very many forms of crystallized carbonate of lime, including\r\n“dog-tooth” spar of a pale yellow color are found both in the hard and\r\nsoft reef, and zeolites of various colors and species, bristling upon\r\nand within cavities of the rock. The reef as a whole is fairly even all\r\naround the mine, but at the southeast it is very much contorted in the\r\nupper layers.\r\n\r\nThe wall formed by the hard rock around the mine is very compact and\r\nsmooth, and runs inward in some places as much as 30° or 40°, but in\r\nothers very much less. This naturally causes a cutting out of the claims\r\nor a contraction of the mine, but it is said that the blue ground of the\r\nKimberley Central company is now gaining again, and this state of things\r\nmay also take place with other claims in the Kimberley mine at different\r\ndepths. (See illustration.)\r\n\r\nI think this is a fairly full and accurate description of the geological\r\nstrata outside of the Kimberley mine. I shall now pass on and give a\r\ndescription of the formation of the interior of the mine.\r\n\r\nWhen the place was first prospected there was little to distinguish it\r\nfrom the surrounding country, but in the eyes of the experts of those\r\ndays the slightest difference was enough to urge them to seek,\r\n“fossick,” or prospect for diamonds, that is to say, scratch or dig up\r\nthe surface, sieve and sort it, and sink small trial shafts, when if\r\ndiamonds or good indications were not discovered at a moderate depth,\r\nthe place was abandoned, and the prospector tried or “fossicked”\r\nelsewhere. A digger would pitch upon what appeared to him to be a likely\r\nspot, when, if after passing the red sand and the lime or calcareous\r\ntufa, he came to shale, he abandoned his “prospect” as useless; but if,\r\non the other hand, after going below the lime he came to “yellow\r\nground,” a substance something like greenish compact wood ashes, he\r\nwould continue his work for some time, in the full expectation of being\r\nrewarded in the end by a good find. But in many cases this desired\r\nresult was not attained, although the digger had every encouragement to\r\npersevere by finding garnets of various kinds, the pyrope garnet,\r\nusually called a ruby, especially giving him encouragement to proceed\r\nwith his work; epidote, pisolites, talc ilmenite, called by the diggers\r\ncarbon, iron pyrites, ice spar, zircon, and various other minerals;\r\nstill after all his perseverance, and after finding all these\r\nindications, and sinking to a depth very often of twenty or thirty feet,\r\nnot a single diamond would be found, he would abandon the place, when\r\npossibly after a time it would be tried again by other parties of\r\ndiggers, but with no better result.\r\n\r\nThe surface, as already stated in the description of the reef, was a\r\nred, sandy soil of an almost uniform depth of six feet, followed by a\r\nlayer of calcareous tufa and one of yellow diamondiferous soil,\r\naveraging in thickness sixty-five feet.\r\n\r\nIn the red sand diamonds were frequently found, especially when it was\r\nmixed with nodules of calcareous tufa which had been thrown out by the\r\nant-bear (_Myrmecophaga jubata_) in making its enormous burrow, but the\r\ndistribution of the diamonds which were picked up on the surface of a\r\nlarge tract of country was mostly attributed to birds. Coming next to\r\nthe tufa bed proper, this was of a thickness from two to eight feet, but\r\nwas not a compact homogeneous mass, but composed of honeycombed nodules\r\nand masses impacted together, which required much labor to break out.\r\nSome diggers smashed up all the nodules thus broken out with sledge\r\nhammers, or the sides of their picks, and sometimes, but very rarely,\r\nthey were rewarded by finding diamonds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kimberley Diamond Mine, Griqualand West:——South\r\nAfrica.—1885]\r\n\r\nWhen the yellow ground was arrived at, which, as already stated, was of\r\nan average depth of sixty-five feet, and contained many nodules of\r\ncalcareous tufa of all sizes, the color was of a pale yellowish green,\r\nbut when it became dry it was somewhat of the color of bath-brick, very\r\nfriable, and appeared much like fine wood-ash pressed together. It could\r\nbe broken up to a fine powder with very little beating either with\r\nsticks or shovels. Most of this yellow ground was sorted dry, as washing\r\nwas not practiced at the dry diggings at that time.\r\n\r\nSome few feet, perhaps eight or ten, before the yellow ground joined the\r\nblue, a very gradual change of color took place from yellow to a\r\nlightish green, then light greenish blue, gradually darkening to blue;\r\nbut still a line of demarcation of the two kinds of ground could easily\r\nbe made out.\r\n\r\nThe top of the blue bed was not a level surface, but full of heavings\r\nand billows like a choppy cross sea. From the crest of a rise to the\r\nbottom of a hollow was about six feet; and the distance from crest to\r\ncrest from thirty feet to sixty or more.\r\n\r\nAt this junction there was found in many instances a thin layer of\r\nporous soil holding water in the hollows or wave bottoms. This proved to\r\nbe merely catch water, as after a short time it was invariably removed\r\nin the ordinary course of work, which would not have been the case had\r\nit been derived from perennial springs, yet this at the time created\r\nconsiderable alarm. All or most of the water that now finds its way into\r\nthe mine, is through the main reef.\r\n\r\nTo turn again to the blue ground, it is mixed with small rounded stones\r\nof basalt and small angular fragments of carboniferous shale, as well as\r\nwith many other minerals which I shall mention further on.\r\n\r\nThe blue ground is rather hard and tough when wet, but easily broken\r\nwhen it becomes dry, when the same characteristics which the black reef\r\npresents here show themselves in pulverizing when again wetted, much\r\nafter the manner of quicklime, but differing from it in not developing\r\nheat. This property is made use of by the miners to release the\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nMiles of country may be seen covered with blue lumps spread out to a\r\nthickness of from one to two feet, awaiting rain, or for the purpose of\r\nbeing watered by means of carts and water-hose, after which process it\r\nis rolled and harrowed by means similar to those used in dressing\r\nploughed fields. The diggers used to employ gangs of natives to beat and\r\nbreak up this diamondiferous ground with picks and wooden beaters, yet\r\nthe dusky native found time with eagle eye to watch his chance to steal.\r\nIn this way it was thought the majority of the largest stones were lost\r\nto their rightful owners—but of this in another chapter.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of blue ground from claim No. 132 at about 170 feet\r\nfrom the surface was 2.268, air being 60° Fahr., and barometric pressure\r\n25.83 inches. A cubic foot of wet blue ground would therefore weigh\r\n141.34 lbs. The density varies slightly in different parts of the same\r\nclaim and in different localities of the same mine.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth to which the blue has been worked in the open is 420\r\nfeet, and underground by means of shafts and drives about 620 feet. The\r\ndeepest trial shaft, as I have already stated, is 620 feet, and still no\r\nchange is found in the character of the ground, except that it is a\r\nlittle denser and harder to work, and in most cases is also richer in\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that when a claim was first opened out and found to\r\nbe rich in diamonds, it generally remained so right down, and in like\r\nmanner poor claims remained poor.\r\n\r\nBut bad or poor layers for a time changed this rule, so far as rich\r\nclaims were concerned, for after some feet had been passed, say ten to\r\nthirty feet, a change for the better would invariably take place, so\r\nthat in the long run a close estimate of what a claim would yield could\r\nbe made. At the present time claims which were enormously rich at the\r\nsurface, notably those now forming the Northeast company, were then and\r\nare now amongst the richest claims in the mine. I may also note that a\r\nbelt existed around the mine adjoining the reef, from one-quarter to\r\nhalf a claim in width, which was invariably poor.\r\n\r\nPoor surface claims often became changed to rich ones owing to the\r\nvicinity of a wall of floating reef, and it was often found that after\r\nmonths, even years, had been spent in working down a claim unprofitably,\r\nit would suddenly alter to a payable or probably a rich one, for at a\r\nvarying depth alongside the floating reef, or after the reef had been\r\nremoved, I have many a time known a change for the better to take place,\r\nand the owner, who had been almost reduced to the verge of bankruptcy,\r\nto be soon set upon his legs again.\r\n\r\nSome of the claims at the west of the mine never paid the expense of\r\nworking at the surface, nor even in the yellow ground below, and remain\r\nabsolutely worthless to this day, although the blue ground has been\r\nreached, worked, and tested. About five claims in the very centre of the\r\nmine were proverbially poor, vast quantities of erratic boulders being\r\nmixed up with, and in some cases almost displacing, the yellow and blue\r\nground. Some of these fragments of rock were of immense size, weighing\r\nthousands of tons, and at the same time were so solid that they had to\r\nbe blasted to pieces. They consisted for the most part of dark and light\r\ncolored shales, whinstone or basaltic boulders, and large masses of\r\nfine-grained micaceous sandstone, containing fragments of coal and\r\nremains of a fossil reptile. Much lignite in large stems and branches\r\nwas also found amongst the boulders and in the blue. When this floating\r\nreef was removed, many feet of unprofitable blue had also to be removed\r\nbefore payable ground was reached, but when all the poor ground was\r\ntaken away, the junction of which with the richer ground was very\r\nperceptible by a change of color, the remaining blue did not differ in\r\naverage return of diamonds from the rich claims surrounding it.\r\n\r\nSeveral remarkable detached boulders were found. One in No. 3 road\r\nsouth, of such a large size that it covered the two claims of a\r\nwell-known digger named Olsen, Nos. 136 and 166. It was a pudding-stone,\r\nits chief constituent being grayish white crystals and fragments of\r\nfeldspar, transparent and translucent, concreted together with carbonate\r\nof lime. This “erratic” contained also nodules of quartz, crystals of\r\niron pyrites, and many small cavities filled with diamondiferous soil of\r\na light brownish gray color.\r\n\r\nAgain in Nos. 8 and 9 roads south, there was an isolated basaltic\r\nboulder, nearly round, of gigantic proportions. It almost filled up\r\nclaims 432 and 433 in road No. 8, and claims 462 and 463 in road No. 9,\r\nand measured in diameter 70 feet, 35 feet in the yellow ground and the\r\nsame in the blue below. It was much decomposed, and large flakes or\r\nlayers frequently fell away into neighboring claims, causing many\r\nlawsuits. The claim-holders burrowed round this piece of rock as long as\r\nthey possibly could, but at last they had to face the expense of\r\nbreaking it up and removing it. The upper portion of this stone in the\r\nyellow ground had a yellow, and the lower portion in the blue a blue\r\ntint, showing that the same cause which affected the coloring of the\r\ndiamondiferous ground also affected the imbedded “erratic.”\r\n\r\nThe floating reef proper in the Kimberley mine extended from the\r\nsoutheast to the northwest; but there was also a large patch of floating\r\nreef running north and south in No. 8 road.\r\n\r\nThe width of this reef varied from five feet to forty feet, and the\r\naverage depth was about 200 feet. It was formed of a light olive-gray\r\ncolored laminated shale, with a few rounded stones and angular pieces of\r\nbasaltic rock, as well as occasional fragments of fine grained\r\nsandstone. These walls of shale were for the most part compact and\r\nunbroken, with a few straggling pieces of various sizes in the immediate\r\nvicinity. This rock was totally different from any forming the walls of\r\nthe mine, and no similar shale has been recognized to my knowledge in\r\nany part of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the southwest of the mine, in ground at that time belonging to\r\nMessrs. Lewis and Marks, there was a large floating reef composed of\r\ndisintegrated igneous rock, resembling dolerite, which commenced near\r\nthe main reef, and which jutted out to a distance of 120 feet in a\r\nnorthwesterly direction; this was a different rock from that forming the\r\nwalls of the mine or any discoverable in the adjacent country.\r\n\r\nVeins or seams of crystallized carbonate of lime frequently run through\r\nthe blue ground in all directions, in sheets more or less broad, and\r\nvarying in thickness from a mere trace to two or three inches. The\r\ncalcite is covered with a coating of a grayish white substance, very\r\nsoapy to the touch, resembling steatite. Some of this lime contained\r\ncavities, having a fine deposit of iron pyrites which exhibited the most\r\nbrilliant iridescence conceivable. One specimen which I saw was so\r\nbeautiful that it was thought even worthy of presentation to royalty,\r\nand the owner gave it to Captain Harrell (formerly Cis-Molappo\r\ncommissioner) for the purpose, but through some blundering or other it\r\nnever reached its destination. Eventually, I believe, Captain Harrell,\r\nwith the consent of the donor, caused it to be deposited in the South\r\nKensington Museum.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Henry Barkly was here in 1872 this was shown him, and he\r\nconfessed it to be unique, in his opinion, and the prettiest specimen of\r\nthe kind he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nWhen a wall or block of blue ground is dressed down and left standing\r\nwith such a vein—or _greasy slip_, as it is termed—in it, it becomes\r\nhighly dangerous, as all above the vein (at times an immense mass) is\r\nliable to come down without a moment’s warning.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 an account of the chemical and optical properties of the yellow\r\nand blue ground, and the contained minerals was given in London to the\r\nmembers of one of the learned associations there by Prof. N.\r\nStory-Maskelyne, F. R. S., keeper, and the late Dr. W. Flight,\r\nassistant, of the mineral department, British Museum, and although\r\nrather technical in character will no doubt be interesting to those who\r\nwould like to make themselves acquainted with the formation of the\r\ndiamond mines. Extracts from this account will show the nature of the\r\nrock commonly but erroneously called the matrix of the diamond, and also\r\nfurnish a list of minerals found in the samples furnished to the above\r\nmentioned scientists. Alluding to the yellow and blue these gentlemen\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n  “Ground mass, pulverulent, soapy, light yellowish in the upper, and\r\n  of an olive-green to bluish gray color in the lower regions of the\r\n  excavations, is a hydrated bronzite. Through it is disseminated a\r\n  considerable amount of vermiculite.... In this ground mass fragments\r\n  of shale and a micaceous looking mineral—sometimes an important\r\n  constituent.... It is a mineral of the vermiculite group....\r\n  Ferriferous eustatite (bronzite), prismatic crystals of a bright\r\n  green color not infrequent, of the size of canary seeds—colored\r\n  brilliant green by nickel.... Hornblendic mineral accidental—closely\r\n  resembling smaragdite garnet. Ilmenite.[26]... Diallage much\r\n  altered, opaline silica, sometimes resembling hornstone. Calcite.\r\n  Bronzite, small bright green crystals, with something of an emerald\r\n  tint, prismatic; angle 87° 20′. Hydrated bronzite; drab (or pale\r\n  buff tint) much broken up, and cemented by calcite in bar-like\r\n  forms, resembling feldspar.... Through it is disseminated a\r\n  considerable amount of vermiculite—vaalite—surface of a fine bluish\r\n  green like that of clinochlore, giving color to the mass. Hexagonal\r\n  prisms 60° and 120°, resembling halite. Garnet zircon, brownish\r\n  white. Hornblende crystals, with the appearance of smaragdite.\r\n  Grossular garnet. Brilliant little black tourmalines.\r\n  Smaragdite:—brilliant grayish green fragments of crystal, angle 125°\r\n  15′ equal to hornblende type. Olivine, steatite; variety of\r\n  vermiculite, or a ferriferous eustatite or bronzite. Transparent\r\n  striated mineral, of fibrous irregular outline, augitic cleavage;\r\n  pale brown, in some lights a violet tinge. Between the fibres minute\r\n  bars of brown vaalite, but tolerably free from calcite; occasionally\r\n  associated with a yellow wax-like substance, probably opal. This\r\n  striated mineral may be regarded as made up of\r\n\r\n                        Bronzite          43.850\r\n                        Hydrated bronzite 24.017\r\n                        Opaline silica    30.895\r\n                        Alumina             .970\r\n                        Chromium oxide      .251\r\n                                          ——————\r\n                                          99.983\r\n\r\n  “The base of the rock[27] consists of the same ingredients as that\r\n  described above, the mass of it being the hydrated bronzite. The rock\r\n  is further very full of fragments of the shale, which has been\r\n  altered, but still contains carbon; indeed the character of the rock\r\n  is almost that of a breccia, in which these masses of shale are\r\n  cemented by hydrated bronzite containing the vaalite and the bright\r\n  green bronzite, with ilmenite and the other minerals associated with\r\n  it.... The several minerals composing the rocks, exhibit this\r\n  undoubtedly once igneous rock in the light of a bronzite rock,\r\n  converted into a magnesium silicate, which has the chemical character\r\n  of a hydrated bronzite.... The steatite like magma in which the other\r\n  minerals and shale fragments are contained may have originated in an\r\n  augitic mineral, but this is not very probable. The alterations that\r\n  have ensued from the shattering of the eustatite rock, at a period\r\n  subsequent to its becoming solidified, having aided in effecting the\r\n  hydration that has so largely changed it from an eustatite rock into a\r\n  mixture of eustatite with a hydrated eustatite, a combination which,\r\n  both in its composition and structure, recalls vividly to the mind the\r\n  similar mixture of the former mineral with the so-called pseudophite\r\n  in which it occurs at Zdar, in Moravia.”\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing description a fair idea may be arrived at of both the\r\nformation and appearance of this mine, which may fairly lay claim to be\r\none of the wonders of the world. In the next chapter I will give the\r\nprincipal theories concerning the origin of this mine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\nSOURCE OF DIAMONDIFEROUS SOIL.—EXTRACT FROM MESSRS. BAIN, URE, DANA AND\r\n  OSBORNE’S GEOLOGICAL THESES.—VARIOUS THEORIES ADVANCED—NONE ENTIRELY\r\n SATISFACTORY OR CONCLUSIVE.—THE ORIGIN OF THE PRECIOUS STONE VEILED IN\r\n                                MYSTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extracts in the previous chapter, taken from the papers of the\r\nafore-mentioned mineralogists, show, there can be no doubt, that the\r\ndiamondiferous soil of the diamond mines of South Africa is, for the\r\nmost part, the débris of an igneous rock; but little or no idea is given\r\nhow the mines became filled with the soil. Although I am unable to throw\r\nany additional light upon this very difficult subject, I nevertheless am\r\nof opinion that this chapter would be incomplete without giving a few\r\nmore extracts from previous writers. I may mention, however, that\r\nscarcely a sufficient number of facts have as yet been gathered to\r\nenable geologists to offer any theory of the formation of the diamond\r\nmines that will carry conviction with it.\r\n\r\nIn a report to Col. Charles Warren, acting administrator of Griqualand\r\nWest, by Mr. T. C. Kitto, a mining engineer who was then visiting the\r\nprovince, and who previously had some experience in Brazil, and which\r\nreport was published in the local government _Gazette_ of July, 1879, he\r\nstates: “I shall at once assume the Kimberley mine formation to be the\r\nresult of earthquakes and volcanic agency. That the De Beers, Du Toit’s\r\nPan, and Bulfontein belong to the same group; that the diamond deposit\r\nhas been ejected from below, and that the diamonds were formed previous\r\nto their final deposition in the crater.”\r\n\r\nAnother geologist, Mr. Thos. Bain, district inspector P. W. D.,\r\n“considers the numerous superficial deposits of calcareous tufa are the\r\ndetritus of the tertiary deposits,” as the following quotation from\r\nSilver’s “Hand Book of South Africa” suffices to show: “In reference to\r\nthe beds of clay-stone porphyry before mentioned, Mr. Bain supposes them\r\nto be the products of a vast volcano situated somewhere in the\r\nDrakensberg range, whose products spread ruin and desolation over the\r\ncarboniferous forests for hundreds and thousands of square miles, and\r\nwere afterward swept away by the action of water, except what yet\r\nremains of the débris in those porphyry dykes, and the greenstone tops\r\nof the multitudinous hillocks and kopjes in the region toward the north.\r\nThe elevated plateaus of Hantam, Roggeveldt, Nieuweld and Sneeuwberg\r\nform its inland boundaries. This immense desert, as geology tells us,\r\nwas once a great lake, bordered by an umbrageous flora, whose former\r\nexistence can only now be attested by the petrified monocotyledons\r\nburied in its finely laminated slates, and whose waters were crowded\r\nwith the numerous adentulous animals or the varied family of dicynodons\r\nand other saurian reptiles found in no other part of the globe.”\r\n\r\nI give another extract from this admirable guide book of South Africa,\r\nas bearing upon this subject: “In the part of Namaqualand called\r\nBushmanland, and which is a vast table-land about 3,000 feet above the\r\nsea, are immense deposits of what Mr. Dunn calls glacial conglomerate.\r\nThese extend westward into the sovereignty (Free State), and in them in\r\na sort of tufaceous limestone deposit seem to occur the diamond deposits\r\nwhich have made that region so famous.”\r\n\r\nDr. Ure, in his “Dictionary of Arts, Mines and Manufactures,” states:\r\n“The ground in which diamonds are found in the mines of Brazil is a\r\nsolid or friable conglomerate, consisting\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nDr. Ure, in his “Dictionary of Arts, Mines and Manufactures,” states:\r\n“The ground in which diamonds are found in the mines of Brazil is a\r\nsolid or friable conglomerate, consisting chiefly of a ferruginous sand,\r\nwhich incloses fragments of various magnitude of yellow and bluish\r\nquartz, of schistose jasper, and grains of gold disseminated with\r\nologist iron ore, all mineral matters different from those that\r\nconstitute the neighboring mountains. This conglomerate, or species of\r\npudding-stone, almost always superficial, occurs sometimes at a\r\nconsiderable height on the mountainous table-land.”\r\n\r\nDana says: “The original rock in which diamonds are found in Brazil\r\nappears to be either a kind of laminated granular quartz called\r\nitacolumite, or a ferruginous quartzose conglomerate. The itacolumite\r\noccurs in the Urals, and diamonds have been found in it, and it is also\r\nabundant in Georgia and North Carolina, where diamonds have also been\r\nfound, while in India the rock is a quartzose conglomerate.”\r\n\r\nThe following extract which also bears upon the subject is from a report\r\nby Mr. C. F. Osborne, M. E. on the Knysna gold fields, and may prove\r\nboth interesting and valuable, and this I have taken from a blue book of\r\nthe Cape parliament of May, 1886:\r\n\r\n  “The mineral character of the rocks is in some respects peculiar, and\r\n  they differ much in reality and very much in appearance, from the\r\n  gold-bearing rocks of Australia or California, and even from those of\r\n  the Transvaal; and the average Australian digger, judging from\r\n  appearances merely, would doubtless, at first sight and without trial,\r\n  pronounce them non-auriferous.... There are several reasons why these\r\n  rocks present such a difference in appearance from those of the\r\n  gold-bearing countries I have named. One is that the principal\r\n  gold-bearing rock here is itacolumite, a rock which does not exist, or\r\n  is very sparingly developed, in Australia, the Transvaal, and in the\r\n  greater part of California, but which is abundant and characteristic\r\n  of the gold regions in Russia.”\r\n\r\nI will not dilate upon the above extracts as to the source of the\r\ndiamondiferous soil, and will pass on to the origin of the diamonds\r\nthemselves. All authorities state that the diamond is intimately\r\nconnected with gold and platinum, but I cannot find any record which\r\nconvinces me of the diamond having been found in the matrix—that is to\r\nsay, in the rock in which it was originally formed—as all the formation\r\nin which the diamond has been found appear to have been the detritus of\r\nolder rocks, in which it by some means or other had become imbedded\r\nduring the formation of the newer one.\r\n\r\nIn “Precious Stones and Metals,” by C. W. King, M. A., which is a very\r\nlearned and exhaustive work, I find the following: “Pliny remarks that\r\nthe diamond is the companion of gold, and seems only to be produced in\r\ngold itself. He is here correct, although perhaps it may be but by an\r\naccidental coincidence; for all the diamond mines, the discovery of\r\nwhich is recorded, have been brought to light in pursuit of alluvial\r\ngold washings.”[28] Mr. King proceeds to remark: “The British Museum,\r\namongst the native diamonds, exhibits an octahedral diamond attached to\r\nalluvial gold; and, strange confirmation of the ancient idea as to their\r\naffinity, not only is the primary crystal of that metal also the\r\noctahedron, but also its secondary modifications exactly correspond with\r\nthose of the diamond. Modern science has made no further advance toward\r\nthe solution of this problem beyond that propounded as a certainty in\r\nthe ancient ‘Timæus.’”\r\n\r\nThe theory of the Oriental philosophers upon this subject is thus\r\nelegantly condensed in the tetrastich of Akbar’s poet laureate, Sheik\r\nFizee, which formed the legend on the obverse of his chief gold piece:\r\n\r\n   “The sun from whom the seven seas obtain pearls,\r\n   The _black stone_ from his rays obtains the jewel;\r\n   The mine from the correcting influence of his beams obtains gold;\r\n   And the gold is ennobled by the impression of Shah Akbar!”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to confront the latest modern with this the most\r\nancient explanation of the method pursued by nature in producing the\r\ndiamond. Prof. Maskelyne remarks: “Of the numerous solutions of this\r\nproblem one possesses peculiar interest, viz.: that considering diamonds\r\nas deposits on the cooling of fused metals (or other substances)\r\nsurcharged with carbon.... Graphite, boron and silicon are formed on the\r\ncooling of aluminium surcharged with these elements; and the same\r\nelements—in other respects so closely grouped with carbon—separate in\r\nthe adamantine form seen under analogous circumstances. The latter are\r\ncrystallized, indeed, in different systems from the diamond, but they\r\npossess many of its characters in a remarkable degree.”\r\n\r\nProf. Maskelyne also observes: “Gold seems in every diamond country to\r\nbe either the associate or the not distant neighbor of the diamond. In\r\nthe diamond, splinters of ferruginous quartz have been found. A high\r\nantiquity, and an origin perhaps contemporaneous and not improbably\r\nconnected with the geological distribution of gold in the quartz-veins,\r\nmay be inferred from these facts.... In Brazil it has been traced to its\r\nrock home in the itacolumite (a micaceous quartzose schist often\r\ncontaining talcose minerals, and intersected by quartz-veins) and also\r\nin hornblende, also continuous with the itacolumite. But whether these\r\nare the parent rocks—or whether they are metamorphic in nature—its\r\norigin comes from an earlier state of the materials that have been\r\ntransmuted by time and the play of chemical and physical forces into\r\nitacolumite and hornblende slate, we are not in a position to declare.”\r\n\r\n“Until lately the diamond had never been traced to its matrix, but this\r\nhas now been done, in at least two instances in Brazil.” The writer\r\nabove quoted says: “The first was in 1839, and the rock which contained\r\nit was described by M. P. Chasseau (Bull. de l’Acad. Royale, Bruxelles,\r\nviii., 331) as _grès psammite_, a sort of sandy freestone, the locality\r\nbeing the Serro di Santantonio di Grammagoa.\r\n\r\n“The discoverers of the deposit took from it many diamonds, as the rock\r\nwas soft; but deeper, it became harder, and consequently more difficult\r\nto work. As many as 2,000 persons from all parts came to the place; but\r\nthey dug without order or plan, and, undermining the rock, part of it\r\nfell down. They still drew a profit from breaking the fragments and\r\nextracting the diamonds. We cannot say how long this was continued. M.\r\nChasseau’s paper was written in 1841, and the deposit in question, as\r\nfar as we can learn, is only again mentioned by M. Semonosoffin in the\r\n‘Annales des Mines,’ 1842. But we know that in 1855 Mr. T. Redington, a\r\nnative of Cornwall, was employed by the Vice-President of the Province\r\nof Minas Geraes to trace the course and tributaries of the principal\r\nriver of the diamond district, so as to find the rock from whence the\r\ndiamond came. Amongst other localities he visited San Joao, about twenty\r\nmiles north of Diamantina, and here found a vein yielding diamonds,\r\nwhich had for about eight years previously been wrought by the natives.\r\nThis he began to work, and though the number, size and qualities of the\r\nstones found have never been made public, he was still engaged upon it\r\nonly some few months since, and probably is so at this moment. No doubt\r\nthese, examples will stimulate others to attempt similar discoveries.”\r\n\r\nSays Garcias: “It seems to me quite a miracle how these gems, which\r\nmight be expected to be produced in the deepest bowels of the earth, and\r\nin the space of many years, should on the contrary be generated almost\r\non the surface of the ground, and come to perfection in an interval of\r\ntwo or three years, for in the mines, this year for instance, at a depth\r\nof a cubit, you will dig and find diamonds: let two years pass and\r\nmining in the same place you will again find diamonds. But it is agreed\r\nthat the largest are only found under the bottom of the rock.”\r\n\r\nIt is singular that in the early days of the dry diggings the diggers\r\nused in joke to express the very same opinions as I have quoted above,\r\nfor they often unearthed diamonds coated with a thin, dark mineral\r\ncrust, which disguised merely the shape of the diamond, not the color\r\nand lustre. Many diamonds were lost through this. After some months,\r\nexposure, or the attrition caused in again disturbing the soil in which\r\nthey had been lying, the whole or part of the coating was so rubbed off\r\nthat the diamond and its lustre became exposed to the digger’s delighted\r\ngaze. Most probably the idea of the ancients, as to the growth of\r\ndiamonds, originated in the same or a closely similar manner.\r\n\r\nDana says: “The origin of the diamond has been a subject of speculation,\r\nand it is the prevalent opinion that the carbon, like that of coal, is\r\nof vegetable origin. Some crystals have been found with black\r\nuncrystallized particles or seams within, looking like coal, and this\r\nfact has been supposed to prove their vegetable origin.”\r\n\r\nI take the following “New facts concerning the Diamond” from the\r\n_Quarterly Journal of Science_, Oct. 1873:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n  “Whilst our knowledge of the modes of formation of other gems is so\r\n  rapidly advancing that the time does not seem to be very distant when\r\n  the chemist in his laboratory will be able to produce them\r\n  artificially if not in large at all events in microscopic crystals—the\r\n  origin and mode of formation of the diamond is shrouded in apparently\r\n  inexplicable mystery. It is even undecided whether the diamond is of\r\n  igneous or vegetable origin, whether its nature is mineral or organic.\r\n  Some diamonds appear to have been soft, as they are superficially\r\n  impressed by sand and crystals; others contain crystals of other\r\n  minerals, germs of plants, and fragments of vegetation. Professor\r\n  Goppert has a diamond containing dendrites, such as occurs on minerals\r\n  of aqueous origin, and there is at Berlin a diamond which contains\r\n  bodies resembling _protococcus pluvialis_, and another containing\r\n  green corpuscles linked together, closely resembling _polinogtœa\r\n  macrococca_. (Palmoglœa Micrographic Dictionary.) Sir John Herschel\r\n  quotes the case of a Bahia diamond mentioned by Harting, which\r\n  contained well-formed filaments of iron pyrites. Messrs. Sorby and\r\n  Baker have shown that the diamond may contain cavities entirely or\r\n  partially filled with a liquid, probably condensed carbonic acid, and\r\n  that the black specks in diamonds are really crystals which are\r\n  sometimes surrounded by contraction cracks, a black cross appearing\r\n  under polarised light. Sir David Brewster has likewise pointed out\r\n  that the diamond possesses strata of different reflective powers. M.\r\n  Damour states that diamonds sometimes contain spangles of gold in\r\n  their cavities.... When shielded from contact with the air, the\r\n  diamond may be exposed to the highest temperature of our furnaces\r\n  without undergoing alteration, at least in the case of the colorless\r\n  diamond; of colored diamonds more will be said hereafter.... A crystal\r\n  of diamond, inclosed in a piece of dense coke and placed in a plumbago\r\n  crucible packed with charcoal powder, was heated for half an hour in\r\n  one of Siemens’ regenerative furnaces to the temperature at which\r\n  cast-iron melts, without undergoing any change whatever. Another\r\n  diamond, a cut (rose) diamond, which was inclosed in a crucible as\r\n  before and heated for ten minutes in the furnace to a temperature at\r\n  which wrought-iron melts, retained its form and the smoothness of its\r\n  facets but became quite black and opaque, and exhibited a strong\r\n  metallic lustre. The black portion formed a distinct layer of the\r\n  thickness of a hair covering the unaltered substance within. These\r\n  results confirm those of Schrötter, and appear to justify the view\r\n  that diamond, though it undergoes no change when exposed to the\r\n  greatest heat of a porcelain furnace or that at which cast-iron melts,\r\n  is slowly converted at the temperature of molten wrought-iron into\r\n  graphite. G. Rose states that some of the specimens of diamond in the\r\n  Berlin collection appear quite black by reflected, though translucent\r\n  by transmitted light, and that this black substance lying in the\r\n  little irregularities of the surface is found by its behavior in fused\r\n  nitre to be graphite. The relative ease with which graphite and\r\n  diamond burn was determined by exposing them to the same temperature\r\n  for the same time, when the following amounts of the three specimens\r\n  were consumed:\r\n\r\n               Foliated graphite          27.45 per cent.\r\n               Diamond                    97.76  „    „\r\n               Granular massive graphite 100.00  „    „\r\n\r\n  “In a superb cut diamond weighing between six and seven carats, the\r\n  brilliancy of the stone was decidedly increased after the operation.\r\n  The loss of brilliancy observed by Mr. Schrötter is a proof, in M.\r\n  Baumhauer’s opinion, that notwithstanding the precautions employed,\r\n  the diamond had come in contact with the oxygen of the air, or else\r\n  that at so elevated a temperature a reducing action had been effected\r\n  upon the magnesia (in which the diamond had been packed) by the\r\n  diamond, which had then been superficially burnt by the oxygen of that\r\n  earth.\r\n\r\n  A diamond which presented to the naked eye an appearance of dirty\r\n  green was treated in a similar manner; examination with a lens showed\r\n  that the color did not extend to the entire stone, but was confined to\r\n  small portions, which formed small green clouds in the centre of the\r\n  mass. After heating to a white heat in hydrogen, the brilliancy of the\r\n  surface remained as before; the transparency was rather increased than\r\n  diminished, but the green hue was transformed into pale yellow.\r\n  Another small diamond, of so dark a green as to approach black, and\r\n  almost opaque, assumed a violet hue, retaining, however, its\r\n  brilliancy, and becoming more translucid. A small cubic diamond of\r\n  light green color preserved its brilliancy and transparency intact,\r\n  but lost its color completely. No difference in its weight before and\r\n  after the operation could be perceived.\r\n\r\n  “Brown diamonds lose most of their color when heated to whiteness in\r\n  hydrogen; they generally assume a grayish tint, and in all cases the\r\n  shade is much lighter, and on examination with a lens they appear\r\n  limpid, with black spots. Diamonds with a yellow tint, such as Cape\r\n  diamonds almost invariably are, scarcely lose any portion of their\r\n  natural color.... Several experiments were made by von Baumhauer, in\r\n  concert with M. Daniels, upon gray diamonds, in the hope that the\r\n  effect of heat would, by removing their color, add to their value;\r\n  but, unfortunately, the desired result was not achieved, as the\r\n  diamonds presented after treatment the same grayish appearance as\r\n  before. Very different results are obtained when, instead of heating\r\n  the diamond in an atmosphere of hydrogen, it is heated in contact with\r\n  the air. It is unnecessary to employ a white heat, or to subject the\r\n  diamond to it for so long a time, in order to render it dull, and\r\n  consequently opaque; this being the result of positive combustion,\r\n  which is proved by its loss of weight after the operation.\r\n\r\n  “This combustion is, however, quite superficial, as shown by M.\r\n  Daniels, who found that when repolished the diamond recovered\r\n  completely its transparency and its water; it was, moreover, remarked\r\n  by Mr. G. Rose that if the diamond which had become dull was moistened\r\n  with essence of turpentine, it reassumed its transparency and retained\r\n  it so long as its surface continued moist. The diamond may also be\r\n  heated in an atmosphere of oxygen.... In this case the stone obtains a\r\n  vivid state of incandescence, and burns with a dazzling flame long\r\n  before the platinum crucible has attained a reddish white heat. In\r\n  most cases after the lamp has been withdrawn and the crucible is no\r\n  longer red hot, the diamond continues to burn for some time, and\r\n  presents the appearance of vivid light upon a dark ground. When the\r\n  diamond is very small combustion may even continue until it is\r\n  entirely consumed, and it is then seen to dart a more vivid flame at\r\n  the last moment, like a burning match, the instant previous to\r\n  extinction. When the stone is of considerable size the heat produced\r\n  by combustion is insufficient to maintain it after the removal of the\r\n  lamp, and it ceases in a few moments, notwithstanding the oxygen which\r\n  continues to flow into the crucible. Although this last experiment has\r\n  been repeated several times by these experimentalists, no other result\r\n  has been observed than tranquil combustion of the diamond; such\r\n  phenomena as turning black, transformation into coke, change of the\r\n  state of aggregation, bubbling up, melting or softening, rounding of\r\n  corners and angles, were in no case presented to our notice. Once only\r\n  in experimenting upon an opaque grayish diamond, a few sparks were\r\n  emitted, but these were evidently due to the presence of some foreign\r\n  elements incorporated with the whole. Neither did the diamonds burst\r\n  or split, save in one case, where such was foreseen by M. Daniels: a\r\n  stone evidently composed of two diamonds joined together, upon the\r\n  first application of heat broke with considerable violence into two\r\n  fragments, each constituting a decided crystal.... All that took place\r\n  in the crucible could be distinctly seen through the sheet of mica,\r\n  and thus ample evidence was obtained that the diamond, while in a\r\n  state of combustion, is surrounded by a small flame, the exterior\r\n  envelope of which is a violet-blue, similar to that produced by oxide\r\n  of carbon in a state of combustion.\r\n\r\n  “This is especially the case when the diamond is rather large, when\r\n  the lamp has been withdrawn and the platinum has ceased to glow; the\r\n  diamond is then seen upon the black ground of the crucible, brilliant\r\n  with vivid white light, and surrounded by a zone or aureole somewhat\r\n  less bright, its exterior edge being a blue-violet color. Some highly\r\n  interesting microscopic observations relative to the dull surface of\r\n  diamonds which have undergone partial combustion have been\r\n  communicated by Mr. G. Rose; he has discovered on them regular\r\n  triangular markings that resemble those occurring in abundance on the\r\n  fine crystals from the Vaal River, and recall the faces formed on\r\n  planes of crystals, soluble in acid, by the slow and imperfect etching\r\n  action of such a re-agent, as, for example, the action of hydrogen\r\n  chloride on calcite. Like them these depressions on the diamond bear\r\n  an exact relation to its crystalline form, and are determined by\r\n  certain definite faces, their sides being parallel to the edges of the\r\n  octahedral faces of the crystal. Measurement with the goniometer shows\r\n  them to belong to the icositetrahedron, the faces of which have not\r\n  been met with on diamond. These symmetrically shaped pits can easily\r\n  be seen by heating a thin plate of boart in a blow-pipe flame and\r\n  examining it under the microscope.\r\n\r\n  “By prolonged heating several small triangular pits will often merge\r\n  into one large one. A crystal of diamond, even when so reduced in size\r\n  by oxidation as to be only visible with difficulty, continues to\r\n  exhibit sharp edges and angles. A dodecahedron, with very rounded\r\n  faces but smooth and brilliant surface, also exhibited the triangular\r\n  pits often very distinctly; moreover, it had a brown color, which was\r\n  not destroyed by heat, and must therefore be of a totally different\r\n  nature from that of the topaz or smoky quartz.”\r\n\r\nThe above copious extracts by no means exhaust the very interesting and\r\nvaluable particulars to be found in the article, and I would advise all\r\ninterested in the matter to purchase this issue of the magazine, if\r\nstill in print, and read for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that river diamonds and the diamonds of each\r\nmine are quite distinct in character from each other. The Old De Beer’s\r\nstones are much more like those of the river than are those of\r\nKimberley. An experienced buyer can tell at a glance in most cases where\r\na diamond was found, and many buyers, diggers and other experts have on\r\noath expressed their conviction as to the source of certain stones\r\nbefore courts of law.\r\n\r\nThere are no rents or large fissures in the hard containing rocks of the\r\nKimberley mine, but the joints and bedding remain undisturbed, thus\r\nshowing that earthquakes have not acted upon them, at least to any\r\nappreciable extent.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt but that the pits or craters were formed by\r\nvolcanic agency, but it does not follow that the contents thereof were\r\nthrown up at one and the same time, nor indeed that the present contents\r\nwere derived from the craters at all. After denudation had taken place,\r\ncalcareous tufa was deposited from the waters, and then the ferruginous\r\nred sand. It does not appear probable, as suggested by Mr. Kitto, that\r\n“the diamond was formed by a rock being crushed between other rocks\r\npreviously to its being brought to the surface by volcanic agency,” as\r\nthe rock would thus be merely broken into small fragments, whereas it is\r\nin the form of an impalpable powder, intimately mixed with boulders,\r\nnodules and crystals of foreign rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pl. III.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHad diamonds been formed in this rock, and the rock crushed, the brittle\r\ndiamond would not, in my opinion, have escaped being also crushed. It\r\nseems a more feasible theory that the rock when first elevated was in a\r\nheated state, and brought into contact with water then covering the\r\nland, and the sudden cooling caused its sudden disintegration, and that\r\nthe diamonds and other materials foreign to it got mixed with it\r\nsubsequently. However, in either case, the diamonds and other materials\r\ncontained therein would still have to be accounted for, and it does not\r\nappear probable that these should have all been formed with or within\r\none single rock, or that they are all of the same period and were\r\nelevated at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nIf diamonds were formed by heat, it was not in the Kimberley mine, as\r\nthe shale walls and the agglomerate within the mine show no signs of\r\nhaving there been subjected to any great heat; on the contrary, water\r\nand air seem to have been here the active agents.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing extracts it will be seen that no theory as to the\r\nformation of the diamond hitherto advanced is completely, if at all\r\nsatisfactory, and the mystery, if penetrable, must be left to the\r\ngeologist of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         GEOLOGY, FOSSILS, ETC.\r\n                         DESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PLATE I.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Scale ¹⁄₆₀ inch to the foot. This represents a section of a\r\nshaft sunk by the Kimberley Mining Board, at the N. E. of and about 700\r\nfeet from the then margin of the mine. The section was taken by Mr. Geo.\r\nJas. Lee, a gentleman who was at one time chairman of the mining board,\r\nand who, when it finally decided to abandon the shaft named in 1878,\r\ntook the section of which the accompanying diagram or illustration gives\r\nan accurate representation.\r\n\r\nThe dip of the strata is about 2°.5 N. N. W.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Represents a heap of diamondiferous débris from the yellow ground\r\nof the mine, 14 feet in depth.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Surface red sand, 6 feet thick. There was no calcareous tufa\r\nunderlying the red sand here, as is usually the case within the mine\r\nproper and its immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Jointed trap, or blue whin, 15 feet.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Light colored shales; bluish white, olive yellow, gray, etc., 25\r\nfeet. This layer, surrounding and joining the mine, is 50 feet thick,\r\nand contains many fossils, some of which are shown in the following\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Black, or bluish black carboniferous shale, containing four or\r\nfive “iron bands,” or limonite (marked _f_), from 1 inch to 1 foot\r\nthick. This layer is 225 feet thick, and in addition to many fossils\r\nalso contains numerous flat-rounded pieces of black shale, of a harder\r\nnature than the body of the reef, and generally with a _septum_ dividing\r\nthe nodules. Water has evidently worn the masses down on each side of\r\nthis hard division, often giving them the appearance of oyster, mussel\r\nand other shells, also of fish and other forms. One such stone amongst\r\nmany (marked with an arrow) was found just above the hard rock, which\r\nhere commences.\r\n\r\n(_g_) A trachyitic _breccia_ of specific gravity 2.815. This is of a\r\nvery tough, horny nature, and of a pale bluish gray color, sprinkled\r\nwith small particles, both angular and round, of a darker color (3\r\nfeet).\r\n\r\n(_h_) Compact augitic, or hornblendic, very tough (8 feet).\r\n\r\n(_i_) Seamy do. do., closely resembling basaltic trap, 4 feet worked,\r\nbut of unknown depth. The total depth of the working represented in the\r\ndiagram is 300 feet, and was the deepest working in the Kimberley mine\r\nat the time that it was abandoned.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. This represents a diagrammatic section of the interior of the\r\nKimberley mine, from the surface to a depth of about 300 feet, and made\r\nup as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Grass, etc.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Red sand as in Fig. 1, 6 feet.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Calcareous tufa, 6 feet.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Yellow diamondiferous ground, 25 feet. At the junction of the\r\n“yellow” and “blue” the change of color previously alluded to is shown,\r\nand also the porous layer with water oozing from it, and trickling down\r\nthe “face” of the claim.\r\n\r\n(_e_) “Blue ground” with various “greasy seams;”\r\n\r\n(_f_) and boulders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PLATE II.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Hind feet and portion of the vertebræ of a fossil _Dicynodont_\r\nreptile (_Owen_), natural size. Found by Capt. Jas. Scott Helps, in the\r\nwhite shale in a cutting 50 feet deep, at the east of Kimberley mine,\r\nfacing claim .018, and 40 feet back from the margin of the mine,\r\nmeasuring from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe above was drawn by Mr. Geo. Jas. Lee, in Jan. 1878, soon after it\r\nwas found. The above specimen, together with three others, were\r\npresented by Mr. Geo. Jas. Lee to the trustees of the British Museum,\r\nand were, I believe, submitted to Professor Owen, who has now for some\r\nyears past been engaged preparing a monogram upon the Dicynodonts. From\r\nthe _Photographic News_ of Oct. 16th, 1885, I take the following: “The\r\nBritish Association meeting at Aberdeen. In the Geological section, Dr.\r\nR. H. Fraquair described a new and very remarkable reptile, lately found\r\nin the Elgin sandstone, entirely from a photograph of the specimen\r\nsubmitted to him by Professor Judd. He was able to assign the creature\r\nto the genus _Dicynodon_, which characterizes similar sandstones in\r\nSouth Africa.” There are no sandstones, however, near the Kimberley\r\nmine, but the casts of Dicynodons have been found both within and\r\nwithout the mine, and also in fragments of white shale upon the surface\r\nof the ground a few hundred yards away from the mine. In Mr. Ralph\r\nTate’s “Historical Geology,” the following passage occurs:—\r\n“Reptiliferous Sandstones of Morayshire: Geologists have maintained, on\r\nstratigraphical grounds, that the Reptiliferous Sandstones are of the\r\nage of the Old Red Sandstone; but the intervention of a conglomerate\r\nimplies a stratigraphical break, and a lapse of time of indefinite\r\nextent; and the paleontological evidence favors the supposition that\r\nthese sandstones are of Triassic age.” In the light colored shales to\r\nwhich I allude, and nearly in the same place, a fragment of a fossil\r\nfish (_Palæoniscus_) of Triassic age was found, and was presented to the\r\nBritish Museum. I may here repeat a passage from Mr. W. S. Dowel’s\r\npaper, already quoted in this chapter: “Professor Liversidge describes\r\nthe geological formation of the district (Bingera, 350 miles north of\r\nSydney, Australia) as being of the Devonian or Carboniferous age, but\r\nwhen making a visit in 1873 he was unable, in consequence of want of\r\ntime, and wet weather, to secure fossils in order to verify his opinion.\r\nSince then Mr. Donald Porter and others have discovered fossils and\r\nindications that clearly go to show that the professor was correct in\r\nthe opinions he had formed respecting the nature of the geological\r\nstratification and the age to which it belonged.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Portion of a fossil leaf, natural size, found by Mr. Geo. Jas.\r\nLee on Oct. 13th, 1880, in the white shale from the Kimberley mine, at a\r\ndepth of about 50 feet, facing road 9, south. Length (as restored),\r\n2¹⁄₂₀ inches; apex (restored), ¹⁷⁄₄₀ inch; width (entire), 1¼ inches.\r\n\r\nI must leave it for fossil botanists to determine the name of this leaf,\r\nbut should it turn out to be identical with Heer’s “_Populus primæva_”\r\n(which I believe it to be), “from the Urgonian Pattorfick, Greenland,\r\ndescribed twelve years ago (1875) and still remains (in 1885) the sole\r\nrepresentative of this sub-class in any formation below the cenomanian\r\nand the most ancient dicotyledon known.” It is a very valuable specimen,\r\nand almost unique, and must be a source of great satisfaction to the\r\nfortunate finder, as well as geologists in general. Unfortunately at\r\nthis time I have no books of reference upon this subject by me, nor have\r\nI seen a report of Heer’s discovery, therefore I must leave the\r\nclassification of the above leaf entirely in the hands of experts in\r\nfossil botany.\r\n\r\nA photograph of the impression of the leaf has also been taken, of which\r\nFig. 3 is a copy. An impression of the upper and under surface of the\r\nleaf was found to have been very perfectly preserved as a hollow mould\r\nwhen the block of shale containing it was split in halves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PLATE III.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. This is a photograph of a portion of the stem of a _Sigillaria_,\r\nfound in a fragment of black, or carboniferous shale, in the centre of\r\nthe north margin of the Kimberley mine, at a depth of about 100 feet.\r\nThis probably is a new, or at all events a hitherto undescribed species.\r\n\r\nOther very perfect casts of _Sigillariæ_, as well as of Lepidodendra,\r\nhave also been found in the black shale. In the same shale, and about\r\nthe same locality, an imprint of a species of large reptile was found,\r\nprobably of the order _Crocodilia_. The imprint was very perfect, and\r\nmany feet in length, but unfortunately the native workmen then engaged\r\nin throwing down this “reef” had thrown down to the bottom of the mine\r\nevery vestige of the fossil, before a friend of the writer requested Mr.\r\nWilliam McHardy (then and now manager of the Central company) to procure\r\na specimen for him. Mr. McHardy saw this cast himself and informed my\r\nfriend of the find, and at his request (my friend’s) he at once returned\r\nto save it, but unfortunately not a vestige of it was to be found, the\r\nnatives having thrown a vast quantity of reef down, so that the\r\nproverbial needle in the bottle of hay was easily discernible in\r\ncomparison with my friend’s fossil cayman. Other interesting fossils\r\nhave been found in these shales, and have been deposited by their owners\r\nin various museums in Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThis concludes an account of all the fossils in the shales of which I\r\ncan give any authenticated delineation, but I may mention that dendrites\r\nare very common in the light shales, caused by iron stains, mostly of a\r\ndark red color. I have already stated in the body of the chapter\r\nrelating to the Kimberley mine that coal, from a mere trace in thickness\r\nto eight or ten inches, has been found in the black shales surrounding\r\nthe mine.\r\n\r\nFrom the above-mentioned facts, I am inclined to believe that the\r\nexposed strata of the Kimberley mine extends from below the\r\ncarboniferous in the primary rocks to the triassic in the secondary\r\nrocks, of course excluding the tufa and red sand, which would be much\r\nmore recent, and from which I have not heard of any fossils being found.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. This shows a transverse section of a fragment of lignite found\r\nin the Kimberley mine, in Claim 165, at a depth of 140 feet, and\r\nembedded in “blue ground” or diamondiferous soil. Color, jet black.\r\n\r\n_a.a._ Junction of two annual layers, or rings.\r\n\r\n_b.b._ Fissure through medullary ray.\r\n\r\n_c.c._ Portion of medullary ray.\r\n\r\nAverage of internal diameter of tubes, ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ inch.\r\n\r\nInternal diameter of large tube, ¹⁄₈₀₀ inch. Number of layers from\r\noutside to centre of stem from which the section was taken, 48; and the\r\nremains of the bark still adhering to the specimen, ¼ inch thick. The\r\nabove was drawn on Sept. 18th, 1877, by Mr. Geo. Jas. Lee, F. R. Met.\r\nSoc.; F. R. M. S., with the aid of neutral tint glass, 10 inches from\r\nthe paper, and with ½ inch object glass, and A, eye piece, and magnified\r\n121½ times, but here reduced to about 82.6 times.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the lignite found in the Kimberley mine varies from that\r\nof soft charcoal to that of calcite, with which mineral it is mostly\r\nimpregnated; the deepest being the hardest on account of containing more\r\nlime, and having undergone a greater change. It has been found in\r\nvarious parts of the mine, and at different depths. It has been also\r\nfound in all the other mines, and in several instances large portions of\r\nstems, branches and roots were discovered. A specimen from De Beers mine\r\nwas as hard as flint, but still retained its black color. In a specimen\r\nof a supposed root from De Beers mine the cells were square, instead of\r\nbeing circular, as in the figure.\r\n\r\nI may here observe that “fossilized wood,” looking much like chalcedony\r\nor agate, is plentiful all over South Africa, and in the “Bush” (forest)\r\nof the Boston saw-mills, in Natal, not far from the river Umkomaas,\r\ninland to the north of Pietermaritzburg, whole stems of gigantic\r\nfossilized trees are to be found—and of the hardness of silex lying upon\r\nthe ground. So far as I am aware the whole of such specimens are\r\nidentical with the lignite of the Kimberley mine, thus tending to show\r\nthat at one time this vast continent was/covered with forests of\r\ngigantic pine trees. The question at once arises, what has become of\r\nthose forests? Have they been turned into coal in the place where they\r\ngrew? or have they been washed into an ancient ocean and thus\r\ntransported to some distant place? I think the answer must be that the\r\ngreater portion have been washed away, and the remainder, the extent of\r\nwhich it is impossible to estimate, turned into coal and silicated wood,\r\nin, or nearly _in situ_. Fossil botanists will notice with interest the\r\nabsence of distortion in the cells in the section delineated above, as\r\nevincing the fact that they have not been submitted to any great\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nMany of the specimens when found exhibited very evident signs of having\r\nbeen much rolled about and water worn, by their rounded ends, and the\r\nabsence of attached branches, twigs, bark fruit and leaves, none of\r\nwhich have been found but the stems, larger branches and roots, with the\r\nexception of a portion of bark on the piece of the stem from which the\r\nabove section was taken.\r\n\r\nI must here draw the attention of my scientific readers to the great\r\nsimilarity to the section here depicted, and to a similar section of\r\nGreenland coal, as figured in the “Micrographic Dictionary,” 3d edition,\r\n1875. The only apparent difference is in the slight distortion of the\r\ncells in the coal from Greenland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. IV _Fig. 1._ _Fig. 2._ _Fig. 3._ _Fig. 4._]\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. This shows a vertical radial section of the same lignite as that\r\nof Fig. 1, and drawn upon a slightly smaller scale, and by the same\r\nmeans, by Mr. Lee.\r\n\r\nDiameter of pits or glands, rather less than ¹⁄₁₀₀₀ an inch, or ¹¹⁄₁₂ of\r\n¹⁄₁₀₀₀ = .000916 of an inch.\r\n\r\nCentre bright spot of gland ⅔ less than the gland.\r\n\r\nThe above section shows a single and double row of glands, by means of\r\nwhich Mr. W. Carruthers classifies this lignite as being derived from\r\n_recent pines_. (For Mr. Carruthers’ report and that of other\r\nauthorities of the British Museum, see end of this section.) I may here\r\nstate that I have seen many very beautiful sections of coal made by Mr.\r\nG. J. Lee, obtained by him from various parts of the Cape Colony and the\r\nFree State, and they all more or less show the single and double row of\r\npit arrangement, the only difference being that the pits or glands are\r\nmuch smaller, as are also the tubes.\r\n\r\nVertical tangental sections are also the same as in the lignite, which\r\nexhibit the usual characteristics of sections of pine, in showing the\r\nusual reticulated and oval resin cells. In some sections the open\r\nnetwork of the cells is very beautifully preserved.\r\n\r\nThe general reader would hardly thank me for further geological\r\ndisquisitions, which I therefore abandon, though with a certain amount\r\nof reluctance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Remains of a shell, natural size, found by Mr. Hugh Cowan, in\r\nFebruary, 1878, in his claim 163, imbedded in solid “blue ground,” 205\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nThe color of the body of the shell is pale lavender, with white\r\nconvolutions. Drawn by Mr. Lee, and presented by him to the British\r\nMuseum.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the above specimen was much broken and water\r\nworn. The outside of the shell was highly polished, and the broken edges\r\nmuch rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 4. These are representations of the natural size of two bivalve\r\nshells, drawn by Mr. G. J. Lee, and found by Mr. James Beningfield in\r\nhis claims 150 and 377 in the Kimberley mine.\r\n\r\nThese shells were of an olive-green color, and imbedded in fine clay\r\nsandstone. They were given by Mr. Beningfield to Mr. Lee, who presented\r\nthem to the British Museum, the receipt of which was never acknowledged\r\nby the Museum authorities. I therefore fear that they have been lost.\r\n\r\nI am not aware whether the above are marine or fresh-water shells.\r\nSeveral other specimens of shells have been found by Mr. James\r\nBeningfield, who has unfortunately mislaid or lost them, and I have\r\nheard of other diggers having also found specimens, but I have not had\r\nthe good fortune to see them. The above were evidently found in\r\n“erratics,” but that found by Mr. Cowan was undoubtedly found in the\r\nsolid diamondiferous ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   EXTRACTS FROM GEOLOGICAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n“_Fossils from the Diamond Field, South Africa._—Mr. George J.

Sorting\r\nwithout mechanical appliances of any kind was indeed a weary and\r\nheart-sickening toil, especially when, as not very rarely happened,\r\nweeks elapsed without a single diamond being found to reward the digger\r\nfor his almost ceaseless labor. Only the hope that “springs eternal in\r\nthe human breast” enabled the searcher after precious stones to endure\r\nit; and so it was not long before inventions, which ingenuity brought to\r\nbear upon the object of answering the question above propounded, came\r\ninto general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DIAMOND WASHING MACHINE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFirst of all came the “Long Tom,” a trough fitted with ripples, into the\r\nhead of which the gravel was thrown, and through which a constant flow\r\nof water drawn from the river was maintained, while the gravel was raked\r\nand the larger stones and pebbles removed, the fine gravel found behind\r\nthe ripples being taken away to the sorting tables. To this contrivance\r\nsucceeded the “cradle,” a wooden box placed upon rockers and pulsated\r\nupon a flat piece of ground or rock by means of a handle. The cradle\r\ncontained three sieves, the first very coarse and the third extremely\r\nfine. Into the first the mud and gravel were poured, a constant flow of\r\nwater being of course kept up. When the mud had disappeared the first\r\nsieve was hand-sorted, and loud indeed were the shouts of acclamation\r\nand universal was the adjournment to the nearest liquor tent when a\r\ndiamond was found in this receptacle. The contents of sieves Nos. 2 and\r\n3 were then emptied on different ends of the sorting table.\r\n\r\nBoth these appliances were introduced by old gold diggers, and were\r\nsimilar in construction to their Californian and Australian namesakes.\r\n\r\nThird in order came the “baby,” so-called from its inventor, a Mr. Babe,\r\nan American. Three screens, somewhat similar to those used by\r\nbricklayers in making mortar, were suspended by reins (leather thongs)\r\nalmost horizontally to four posts, and were kept in agitation by hand,\r\nthe reins of course giving full play for “pulsation.” The subsequent\r\nprocess was nearly identical with that above described in connection\r\nwith the cradle, which this machine indeed resembled in principle,\r\nthough a decided improvement, as much more work could be accomplished\r\nwith the aid of this invention than with the assistance of its\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nFourth in order came the “cylinder,” constructed of either wire sieving\r\n(10 inch mesh) or punched sheet iron fitted with lids, revolving on an\r\naxle, kept moving by a handle immersed in a tub of water. The gravel\r\nbefore being shut up in a cylinder was screened. This was found to be an\r\nexcellent contrivance for saving labor, and was highly popular, as\r\nobviously the natives could have no opportunity of purloining diamonds\r\nfrom it, as it was only opened for the pouring out of the contents under\r\nthe digger’s personal supervision, or perchance the observing eye of the\r\npartner of his joys and sorrows. It is perhaps unnecessary to add that\r\nafter these machines had come into general use, many, especially the\r\nimpecunious diggers, amongst whom were many Dutchmen, with\r\noverwhelmingly large families, did as best they could with a single\r\nsieve, which served as pulsator and everything beside. To-day even, many\r\nuse this primitive appliance at the river.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the Dry Diggings and the systems that there\r\nprevailed, it may be as well to briefly describe the “sorting table.”\r\nThe top of a packing-case balanced on a heap of gravel often had to\r\nserve this purpose in the early days of the river diggings, and beside\r\nit the digger knelt, crouched or sat, changing his position when it\r\nbecame too wearisome. The more affluent had a sorting table supported by\r\nlegs, and covered with a sheet of iron, being slightly inclined from the\r\ndigger, so that the water might not flow into his lap when the gravel\r\nwas poured out in front of him. Those of my readers who visited the Cape\r\ncourt in the “Colinderies” have seen a sorting table almost if not quite\r\nidentical with the best constructed of the early days. The “scraper,”\r\ntoo, which, though small in size and inexpensive in material, is yet an\r\nimportant instrument in diamond winning, has but little altered. This\r\nlittle wonder is not much to look at, being simply a piece of tin or\r\niron about six to nine inches in width and three to four inches in\r\nheight, with a straight edge and pointed ends. With this the sorter\r\nscrapes—scrapes—scrapes, pushing over the edge of his sorting table,\r\ngarnets, jaspers, carbons, agates, pyrites, crystals and pebbles, which,\r\nhowever interesting to the scientist, are commercially valueless, until\r\nat last a diamond is found, and then the precious stone, large or small,\r\nis dropped into an unpretentious tin or perhaps a broken bottle, and the\r\nprocess goes on as before.\r\n\r\nAt the dry diggings sieving and hand-sorting were at first the usual\r\nmethods employed, and it was long before even so much ingenuity as was\r\nrequired to construct an improved or altered cradle was brought into\r\nplay. The processes named, however, being so wearisome and exhausting,\r\nthey were at last abandoned; and among other labor-saving appliances\r\none, for which much _kudos_ was gained by the inventor or adapter—a Mr.\r\nVan Doussa—was largely used, but does not need detailed description, as\r\nit was simply a combination of the Long Tom and the cradle.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the elaborate washing machines, etc., in vogue to-day,\r\nI will proceed to give my readers some idea of the successive methods by\r\nwhich the diamondiferous soil has been removed from the claims for\r\nmanipulation. The Kimberley mine attracting by its marvelous richness\r\ndiggers from other mines was, at the time of its opening, and indeed\r\nstill is, a wondrous hive of human industry. In the earliest days the\r\nsorting tables were placed in the claims themselves, and marvelous were\r\nthe scenes that then might daily be observed. In a space of some dozen\r\nacres were often gathered together as many as ten thousand people;\r\ndiggers with their wives, sisters and children, busily engaged in\r\nsorting; natives shoveling the earth into buckets ceaselessly, the whole\r\nscene dotted with myriad parasols and umbrellas of the most varied hues,\r\nand awnings of the most gayly-colored blankets. The example of Horace’s\r\n“magni formica laboris,” that insect to which Mr. Eugene Wrayburn\r\nobjected to King Solomon referring him, was closely followed by\r\nthousands filled with sanguine hopes, some doomed to bitter\r\ndisappointment, but full many destined in greater or lesser degree to\r\nhave their realization.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, however, as the claims were worked deeper, it was found\r\nmore convenient to have the sorting tables placed outside the mine. I\r\nmay here mention that in order to facilitate work, roads were reserved\r\nrunning across the mine from north to south. They were some fourteen in\r\nnumber, and 7½ feet being allowed from the claims on each side, were 15\r\nfeet broad. On these roads the native laborers tossed the ground, most\r\nof which was conveyed to the sorting tables outside the mine, but some\r\nto tables placed upon the sides of the road. The waste ground out of\r\nwhich the diamonds had been sorted was of course deposited outside the\r\nmine,[31] after having been conveyed along the roads in sacks or\r\nbuckets, or sometimes in wheelbarrows or carts, by the “boys,”[32] the\r\nname by which the native employés were entitled.\r\n\r\nAs the mine became yet deeper the system of “benches” came into vogue.\r\nThere were levels or terraces cut in the side of a claim, and on each of\r\nthem was posted a native who shoveled up the ground thrown to him from\r\nthe level below, until at last the precious soil reached the roadway,\r\nwhere a fourth or perhaps a fifth native was waiting to convey it to its\r\ndestination. Of course the number of benches varied with the depth of\r\nthe claim.\r\n\r\nWhen yet more of the soil was excavated, another system had to be\r\nadopted, and then a post with a pulley attached was driven firmly into\r\nthe road and the ground drawn up in buckets constructed of either hide\r\nor iron, whence it was tossed into carts drawn by horses or oxen, some\r\nof which, poor creatures, tumbled over into the claim, where they had to\r\nbe slaughtered in order that their misery might be ended as soon as\r\npossible, while others were killed instantaneously. The loss of human\r\nlife in these cases was, however, comparatively small.\r\n\r\nThis system, with the exception that many diggers used windlasses\r\ninstead of posts and pulleys, prevailed until 1874, by which time the\r\nroads had fallen. This had long been foreseen, as isolated portions had\r\nlong before crumbled away, the chasms being spanned by bridges erected\r\nat enormous expense. An entirely new system, therefore, had now to be\r\nintroduced, and this took the form of “stayings.” They were, as a rule,\r\nthree in number if the base or ground be counted, and may best be\r\ndescribed as floors stoutly constructed, the first stage proper being\r\nplaced at a height of about eight feet from the ground, the second about\r\nsixteen feet. Numerous standing wires were stretched from the claims and\r\nalong these were drawn buckets containing the diamondiferous soil, one\r\nperchance bearing a fortune in its narrow space, literally a _multum in\r\nparvo_. The ground was hauled by windlasses worked by natives. So\r\nnumerous were the wires that the mine seemed a yawning pit over which\r\nsome Titanic spider had woven its web, while the noise of the wires was\r\nas loud as the din of the traffic in Cheapside or the Strand, the rattle\r\nof the machinery in a Lancashire factory, or, to be more imaginative,\r\nthe roar of angry waves buffeting a rock-bound coast.\r\n\r\nIn their turn the stages were abandoned, for, as may be imagined, the\r\nprocess of hauling out ground by windlasses worked by hand was a slow\r\nprocess when the claims were worked to a depth of eighty feet or more.\r\n“Whims,”[33] worked by horses or mules, were substituted, and they were\r\nin general use until the reign of steam, which still continues.\r\n\r\nIn other chapters the geological characteristics of the diamonds are\r\ndealt with, and the best authorities quoted at considerable length; in\r\nthis connection, therefore, it will suffice to say that the “yellow\r\nground” only extends to a certain depth; this is friable, and was easily\r\nbroken up by means of shovels and clubs known as “beaters.” Beneath this\r\nground lies the hard blue, the discovery of which, as I mention\r\nelsewhere, caused no small consternation amongst the diggers, who feared\r\nwhen reaching it that they had come to what in alluvial gold digging\r\nwould be called the “bed-rock.” This blue ground requires careful\r\nmanipulation, and 1875 witnessed the general adoption of the “rotary”\r\nalready introduced for the quicker manipulation of the blue. The machine\r\nin question may be thus briefly described: A species of “pay mill,” a\r\nround, stationary pan with two concentric rings of sheet iron about nine\r\ninches in height; in the centre an upright spindle driving six or eight\r\narms, in which are fixed a number of flattish tynes, not unlike the\r\nprongs of a trident, placed in a diagonal direction. Into the circular\r\ntrough formed by the concentric rings the ground was poured, water was\r\nsupplied, and the mud kept in agitation by means of the tynes, the\r\noverflow passing through a small door or opening in the inner ring. This\r\nopening could be regulated by a slide according to the nature of the\r\nground manipulated, rapidity of the revolution of the tynes, etc., etc.\r\nThe machine was kept in work by means of cog-wheels at the top of the\r\nspindle. At opposite points of the circumference of the machine Kafirs\r\nwere stationed to supply the motive power, and stood there turning and\r\nturning all day long. Later on horse power was used for turning the\r\nrotaries, which were much enlarged, and now are almost universally\r\ndriven by steam power. These machines, originally about four feet in\r\ndiameter, and capable of washing some forty loads per diem, are now made\r\nas much as fourteen feet in diameter and from 400 to 800 loads,\r\naccording to the nature of the ground manipulated, can be washed daily\r\nby a single machine. A highly important adjunct to the washing machine\r\nproper is the cylinder, which was introduced after the discovery of the\r\nblue ground. This was frequently found to be too insufficiently\r\ndisintegrated, even after long exposure on the depositing floors, to\r\nallow of its being rapidly washed without more or less serious loss of\r\ndiamonds.[34] To prevent this loss the contrivance to which I allude was\r\ninvented. It is a rotatory cylinder, fixed at an angle of some ten\r\ndegrees, upon which a stream of water plays from a perforated tube\r\ndirectly above it. The upper part of the cylinder is of fine mesh,\r\nthrough which the finer particles of the wetted ground or mud fall upon\r\na table, in the centre of which is an inclined trough leading to the\r\nwashing machine, and along this the “magma” or slush mentioned flows by\r\nnatural gravitation. The lower half of the cylinder is of coarser or\r\nmore open mesh, allowing stones and larger lumps to fall upon the table\r\nto be swept off by sorters with watchful eyes for any large diamonds\r\nwhich may be present. This stuff is then generally treated as worthless\r\nand thrown away, but the yet larger lumps that issue from the mouth of\r\nthe cylinder are, as a rule, taken back to the depositing sites for\r\nfurther exposure.\r\n\r\nThe mud which flows from the opening in the inner ring of the rotary is\r\nraised by small buckets (called elevators) on an endless chain to a\r\nheight of some twenty-five feet, when it is ejected, the more solid\r\nportion flowing down screens, either to run down in “tailings” on the\r\nspot or into trucks to be emptied elsewhere. The uninitiated who visit a\r\nwashing machine and elevator occasionally get an unpleasant surprise\r\nwhen their curiosity leads them to wander any distance from their guide,\r\nfor the tailings, though solid enough at a distance from the flow from\r\nthe elevator, are there almost liquid, though to the sight, by reason of\r\nthe dry film at the surface, they appear literally _terra firma_. One\r\nunwary step and the too inquisitive visitor is up to his knees, waist,\r\nor even his neck, in a “slough of despond,” whence he is rescued\r\npossibly minus a boot or shoe by his apparently sympathizing though\r\nreally much amused friends, a spectacle for gods or men.\r\n\r\nI may here interpolate a few remarks as to the mistakes that were made,\r\nespecially by the early diggers, as to the nature of the stone\r\nunearthed. Men unused to digging came and took out claims, especially in\r\nthe Du Toit’s Pan mine, a mine which has from the first been renowned\r\nfor large diamonds, and also for a considerable output of “crystals,”\r\nwhich are of no commercial value. A large crystal, showing all the\r\nangularity of the diamond and otherwise closely resembling it, often\r\nraises hopes soon doomed to be disappointed. A Boer (a true story for\r\nwhich I can vouch) arriving with his wagon, in which rode his wife and\r\nchildren, acquired a claim, and shouldering his pick, with shovel in\r\nhand, he started to work, and _mirabile dictu_, in an hour he discovered\r\na huge stone. Delighted beyond measure at his glorious find, he yet\r\ndeemed it prudent to conceal it from every one.\r\n\r\nPacking up his goods and inspanning his oxen, he started for Port\r\nElizabeth, where he had heard that the highest prices were paid for\r\ndiamonds. A six weeks’ “trek” found him safely arrived at the bay, and\r\nwith his gem in his pocket he sallied forth to the office of a\r\nwell-known firm of buyers. He explained how he had become possessed of\r\nthe priceless brilliant, how he had not shown it to a living soul and so\r\nforth, but when he produced the marvel of beauty, the merchant\r\nmercilessly shattered all his six weeks’ dreams by telling him that it\r\nwas a “crystal,” and of no value whatever save as a curio!\r\n\r\nTo return to the subject of machinery. It was not, however, until after\r\nthe share mania of 1880 and 1881, when many companies were floated, that\r\nmuch large machinery was imported from England. The small six and\r\neight-horse power engines nevertheless began to give way to those of\r\nsixteen, twenty-four, and even sixty-horse power. The “blue” which had\r\nfrightened the early diggers, too, and which had to be spread out on\r\nfloors for miles around the various camps to disintegrate, at the great\r\nloss of time and money, about this period attracted considerable\r\nattention, it being thought possible that some other means of rendering\r\nit sufficiently pulverized for washing purposes might be discovered. A\r\nMr. Cowan, a large digger at the time, spent several thousands of pounds\r\nin experimenting with steam, but to no avail. In releasing this “blue”\r\nfrom the mines, large quantities of gunpowder were used, until dynamite,\r\nof the estimated yearly value of £100,000, has been introduced into the\r\nsystem of mining within the last eighteen months or two years.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the fall of reef in the Kimberley and De Beer’s mines,\r\nunderground working has been resorted to, the open diggings in many\r\ninstances having become practically unworkable in consequence of the\r\nenormous cost of hauling out the fallen reef. The diggings in the open\r\nunincumbered workings of the Kimberley mine before the disastrous fall\r\nof reef had attained to a depth of some 420 feet. By a system of\r\n“underground” mining the main difficulty in reaching the diamondiferous\r\nground has been overcome, shafts have been sunk, tunnels made, and the\r\nprecious “blue” again reached and hauled out. The richness of this\r\n“blue,” at the depth from which it has been brought, has again lifted\r\nthe shareholders out of the mire of financial trouble in which they\r\nfound themselves by reason of the great reef fall. From that time to the\r\npresent, the Kimberley mine has been, comparatively speaking, relieved\r\nof its troubles. Shares in the various companies have risen, dividends\r\nhave and are being paid regularly, and to human ken it would appear that\r\nthe future of this mine, with still further improved working, which the\r\nexigencies of circumstances will suggest, is one of hope virtually\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nThe De Beer’s mine, the greater portion of which is now in the hands of\r\na powerful company, with a capital of considerably over a million\r\nsterling, is fast coming to the fore. Large dividends have been paid,\r\nand tests made as to the future output. At a depth of 750 feet “blue”\r\nground continues to be found in the shaft sunk for the purpose. Here\r\nalso “underground” workings are going on apace with every probability of\r\nyielding for years to come handsome returns to investors.\r\n\r\nIn the Du Toit’s Pan and Bulfontein mines, companies which a short few\r\nyears ago were non-dividend paying are forging to the front and their\r\nshares quietly approaching “par.” In the Du Toit’s Pan mine a test shaft\r\nof 450 feet below the open workings has been sunk, which proves that the\r\ndreaded reef is not increasing, and that the future is in a measure\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe native labor of the diamond fields is drawn from an enormous extent\r\nof country, and includes nearly twenty different tribes, such as Zulus,\r\nSwazies, Basutos, Shangaans, Amatongas, Bechuanas, Metabélés, Mashonas,\r\nMakalolos, Korannas, Griquas, Fingoes, Pondos, Pondomise, Hottentots,\r\netc. These number at the present time about 15,000, while the white\r\nemployés can be estimated at about 3,000.[35]\r\n\r\nAlthough no census has been taken it is estimated that the population\r\nconsists of some 20,000 Kafirs, Malays, Indians, Arabs, Chinamen and\r\nother colored races, and about 6,000 whites, Colonials, English, French,\r\nGerman and Italians.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of steam engines at work in and around the four mines is\r\ncomputed at 350 with a nominal horse power of 5,000. Tramways of nearly\r\n200 miles in the aggregate extent are in use, the trucks upon which are\r\ndrawn by fully 3,000 horses and mules. To quote from the “Cape Official\r\nHandbook,” published in 1886, the annual expenditure in labor, material,\r\netc., is not less than £2,000,000 sterling, distributed somewhat as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n               Wages, salaries, etc.          £1,000,000\r\n               Fuel and water                    250,000\r\n               Mining material and stores        250,000\r\n               Explosives                        100,000\r\n               Forage and stable expenses        125,000\r\n               Rates, taxes, general expenses    275,000\r\n                                              ——————————\r\n                                              £2,000,000\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the item of fuel is a most important one.\r\nBefore the completion of the railway in 1885 and the consequent\r\navailability of coal at comparatively moderate rates, firewood for\r\nengine and household purposes was so greatly in demand that for a\r\nwagon-load weighing from 8,000 to 10,000 pounds as much as £45 was\r\nfrequently paid, and a proportionate amount for smaller loads. Coal\r\nhaving now entered into competition by reason of cheaper transport the\r\nprice of fuel has been greatly reduced, as may be readily imagined.\r\n\r\nThrough the wholesale consumption of growing timber, to which I have\r\nalluded, the country around has been denuded of wood, and the natural\r\nresult of de-arborization has followed in continual droughts of frequent\r\noccurrence, nor has any effort been made so far to plant a new growth.\r\nThis is greatly to be deplored; at the present moment fuel is brought by\r\nox-wagons as far as 200 miles to the Kimberley market, which means some\r\nthirty-five days’ journey for the incoming and outgoing trips.\r\n\r\nWater, too, is a most vital question on the fields. When the early\r\ndiggers first came, as much as a shilling a bucket was given for that\r\nnecessity, which had to be brought into the camp from springs four miles\r\naway. It soon became evident, however, that nature had stored an\r\nabundant reservoir. Wells were sunk, and a supply insured, which more or\r\nless sufficed many years afterward for all the purposes of manipulating\r\nthe diamondiferous ground, as well as for household purposes. By the\r\nforesight of a respected citizen, Mr. Thomas Lynch, a scheme was started\r\nfive years ago, which I successfully guided through the legislative\r\ncouncil of Griqualand West, and which culminated in the floating of the\r\nKimberley Waterworks Co., Limited. This company now brings in the water\r\nfrom the Vaal River, twenty miles away, and supplies not only most of\r\nthe mining companies but also the private residences of Kimberley and\r\nthe surrounding neighborhood. This company has had practically a\r\nmonopoly, and the management of its affairs has been most judicious, but\r\nan opposition is now on foot for the separate supply of water to Du\r\nToit’s Pan, Beaconsfield, and Bulfontein.\r\n\r\nFrom the above particulars, which I have endeavored as far as possible\r\nto condense, my readers will, I trust, be able to form a tolerably\r\nadequate idea of the manner in which the mines of Griqualand West are\r\nworked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                                I.

B.’S, OR ILLICIT DIAMOND BUYERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe diamond, from its value, its portability, and the ease with which it\r\ncan be secreted, has offered in India, Brazil and the Cape, at all\r\ntimes, a great temptation to dishonesty to those engaged in winning it\r\nfrom the soil.\r\n\r\nWhether we refer to the works of the English traveler, William Methold,\r\nwho visited the mines near Golconda in 1622, (where there were 30,000\r\nlaborers then at work) and mentions that it was impossible to prevent\r\nthe abstraction of diamonds; those of Tavernier, the French traveler,\r\nwho visited the Indian mines in 1766; Mawes’ description of the\r\nBrazilian diggings in the same century, where, in spite of the strict\r\nwatch maintained over the slaves employed, they managed to steal half of\r\nthe diamonds produced, or we study contemporary literature with regard\r\nto the mines of Griqualand West, we find that although most severe\r\npunishments have always been inflicted with a view to stamp out theft,\r\nthey have never hitherto been completely successful.\r\n\r\nWith this subject, however, I shall deal in a future chapter; in this I\r\nintend to treat of the rise and progress of the I. D. B. (illicit\r\ndiamond buying) trade, and describe the various devices adopted by the\r\nblack thieves and white receivers.\r\n\r\nOn the Vaal River diggings there was very little thieving. The\r\nsemi-patriarchal state of society existing there was not conducive to\r\nsuch a crime, and moreover the natives had not yet acquired a knowledge\r\nof the value of diamonds or “klips”[36] as they were then termed. Each\r\ndigger had brought from the Cape Colony, Natal, the Free State, or\r\nTransvaal, his own servants, hired for a stated time; he lived in their\r\nmidst, gave them both food and physic with his own hands, temptation\r\nthey were delivered from, as they dared not roam about, and they\r\ngenerally remained honest and faithful.\r\n\r\nThis state of things, however, did not last long, as dishonest white men\r\nand cute natives soon put the unsophisticated savage in the way they\r\nwished him to go; but it was not until a large population had gathered\r\nround the dry diggings, composed of the Du Toit’s Pan, Bulfontein, Old\r\nDe Beers and the New Rush, or Kimberley mines, in 1870 and 1871, that\r\ndiggers began to be alive to the enormous losses they were sustaining\r\nthrough the robberies of their native servants. At this time the white\r\npopulation might roundly be estimated at from 20,000 to 25,000, and the\r\nnatives and colored people at from 40,000 to 50,000 souls, or to be\r\nwithin the mark say 60,000 altogether.\r\n\r\nNow it could not be expected that this motley crew, gathered from all\r\nthe four quarters of the globe, would be without some black sheep among\r\nthem. This quickly became alarmingly apparent, for although the early\r\ndiggers, attracted by the chance of sudden fortune, were mostly old,\r\nrespectable colonists, Boers owning farms, and men who had lived in\r\nSouth Africa many years, yet very soon “camp followers,” as debased as\r\nany who ever hung on the rear of an army, began to arrive, drawn from\r\nthe purlieus of European cities; London sending from Whitechapel and\r\nPetticoat Lane her quota of fried-fish dealers, old clo’ men, quondam\r\nfruit merchants, and “vill you buy a vatch” gentry, who speedily brought\r\ntheir home experience into profitable use.\r\n\r\nThe South African native, especially the Zulu, is, as a rule, naturally\r\nhonest. The fact irresistibly forces upon us the conclusion, however\r\nreluctantly we may accept it, that the natives were first taught to\r\nthieve by white receivers of stolen goods.\r\n\r\nIn those days the Basutos, the Shangaans, the natives from the\r\nneighborhood of the Zambesi and the Limpopo, left their kraals and their\r\nhappy hunting grounds in the far interior (allured by the glorious\r\nreports of the money which they could earn) to trudge hundreds of miles\r\non foot for work in the mines, imbued with but one object, the height of\r\ntheir ambition, which was to become the proud possessor of a rifle or\r\nother gun.\r\n\r\nThe quicker this could be effected the sooner they could return to their\r\nhomes; consequently the unscrupulous white man found apt scholars enough\r\nto his hand in these poor blacks, who rapidly learned to steal all the\r\ndiamonds on which they could lay their fingers.\r\n\r\nThen again, as another inducement to thieving, the raw native was\r\nenticed to the canteen to spend his money, and although at this time a\r\nstrict law existed which prohibited any native being served with liquor\r\nwithout an order from his master, the keepers of low grog-shops evaded\r\nthe law by keeping on hand a stock of false orders to suit any\r\nemergency, whilst the villainous compounds[37] they retailed lit up a\r\nfire which could be kept blazing by dishonesty only.\r\n\r\nAt that time also (and even now, though in fewer numbers) eating-houses\r\nwere kept by white men specially for natives. Among such of course were\r\nhonest men who stuck to their legitimate business, but the greater\r\nnumber were suspected, and in the majority of cases rightly, of keeping\r\nsuch houses simply to facilitate and conceal their illicit transactions,\r\nsupplying free food merely to induce natives to bring them diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe business done in eating-houses of this description was reduced to a\r\nsystem. A native of one or the other tribes, whether a Shangaan, a\r\nBasuto, a Zulu, or a Ballapin, was kept in the pay of the proprietors,\r\naccording to the _habitués_ of their houses. These various touts would\r\nremain most of the day, especially at meal times, sitting at the\r\ndifferent tables prepared for native customers eating or pretending to\r\neat with them. These men were chosen for their shrewdness, and any\r\nstrange native coming in for a meal would immediately be accosted in a\r\nfriendly manner by an astute rascal of his own nationality. Where did he\r\ncome from? what was he doing? who was his master? in what claim was he\r\nworking? what diamonds was he finding? were questions the answers to\r\nwhich were soon wormed out of him.\r\n\r\nIf the native had any diamonds for sale he was at once introduced to the\r\nprivate room of the master, which was at the back. If the replies to the\r\nvarious questions put to him were not considered satisfactory, or if he\r\nwere suspected of being a “trap,” the “tip” was very soon given. The\r\ntout would rap on his plate and call out for “inyama futi” (more meat)\r\nwhich was the signal generally agreed upon, when the suspected native\r\nwould be summarily ejected. Sometimes the native (although offering a\r\ndiamond for sale) would not give the name of his master, which was\r\nenough in itself to excite suspicion of his being a “trap.”\r\n\r\n“Woolsack,” a clever native detective in the employ of a Mr. Fox, who\r\nwas at the time the head of the diamond detectives, was several times\r\ncaught in such attempts to “trap.” I remember on one occasion seeing him\r\nprofessionally after he had been beaten and tortured by one of these\r\nKafir eating-house keepers until he revealed his master’s name. “Baas\r\nFox.” having at last been wrung out of him, and the fact of his being a\r\n“trap” found out, he was, after being barbarously treated, tauntingly\r\ntold to go and show his marks to his master.\r\n\r\nHis brutal assailant, though all the time inwardly chuckling over his\r\nnarrow escape, was loud in his public expressions of satisfaction that\r\nhe had caught and thrashed a nigger who had had, as he said, “the\r\nimperence to fancy that a respectable man like him would buy a\r\n‘goniva.’”[38] The detectives, though well aware of everything, but not\r\nwilling to expose their hand, had to look on, grin and leave unavenged\r\nthis assault on their native servant. If brought into court, they knew\r\ntoo well it would merely be a case of white evidence _versus_ black. The\r\ninjuries shown would simply be the marks of condign punishment meted out\r\nto a native for imputed and apparent thieving, inflicted under a natural\r\noutburst of indignant honesty incapable of restraint. The magistrate, in\r\nthe meantime, let him think what he might, would on the evidence have to\r\ndischarge the prisoner, or at most inflict but a nominal punishment.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated, I may add, that certain chiefs required their\r\nsubjects on their return home to bring them a tribute in diamonds. This\r\nI do not believe ever occurred to any great extent, if at all, as in\r\n1872 a party of diggers to test this rumor, taking the law into their\r\nown hands, made a tour through a large portion of the Transvaal and Free\r\nState, overhauling thousands of natives homeward bound, without finding\r\na single diamond on any one of them, although on one party numbering\r\nsome 200 they found 197 guns, £3,000 in gold, and nearly two tons of\r\ngunpowder. In contradiction to this, however, the late Sir Bartle Frere\r\ntold a deputation of the Kimberley Mining Board, which waited upon him\r\nduring his visit to the Fields in 1880, that in coming down through the\r\nTransvaal several traders and other trustworthy people on whom he could\r\nrely had informed him that most of the chiefs, and in fact all the great\r\nones, had stores of beautiful diamonds, which had been brought to them,\r\na few at a time, by their young men on their return home from work at\r\nthe Fields.\r\n\r\nThe native laborer at the present time through contaminating influences\r\nhas become an adept, and will steal with an adroitness which almost\r\ndefies detection.\r\n\r\nIn the Brazilian mines every precaution is taken to prevent thieving,\r\nbut without entire success. A slave on finding a diamond is compelled at\r\nthe moment of its discovery to notify the fact by holding it up between\r\nhis finger and thumb. No slave is allowed to remain for any length of\r\ntime at any one part of the long trough in which the soil is washed for\r\nfear he should plant a diamond for subsequent removal. In addition, all\r\nare narrowly searched, but in spite of this care the slaves hide\r\ndiamonds in the sores on their bodies, which they produce by cutting\r\nnicks in their skins for this purpose, and ofttimes also swallow them,\r\nthough when a negro is suspected of doing so the administration of\r\nstrong purgatives, confinement in a bare room and severe punishment\r\ninvariably follow.\r\n\r\nOur free nigger is not a whit behind his South American cousin; he uses\r\nhis nose, mouth, stomach, ears, toes and hair to conceal the diamonds\r\nthat he steals, and at nightfall walks home from the mine or from the\r\nsorting table singing with an air of _abandon_ which would “deceive the\r\nvery elect,” the diamond being all the while secreted on his person.\r\nThis, previous to the passing of the last Act, he could do with\r\nimpunity, for the searching of servants, although it had been for years\r\npermissible to masters, _vide_ Government Notice No. 14, 1872, was not\r\nas it is now conducted by a government staff. This was especially the\r\ncase when native labor was scarce, for then any individual master was\r\nafraid to make an exception which could give offense, and which might\r\ndeprive him at once of the whole of his laborers.\r\n\r\nAgain, if in working on the depositing floors, where the blue ground\r\nwhich contains the diamonds is exposed to the action of the atmosphere,\r\na diamond should happen to be turned up which could be seen at a glance\r\nwas too large or which there was no opportunity to secrete, the wily\r\nsavage would cover it up quite nonchalantly, but at the same time would\r\narrange the lumps of “blue” around in such a way that when night came\r\nand he returned, he could easily find the spot and secure the precious\r\nstone for himself.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the mines when they were worked deep another dodge would be\r\nresorted to. Suddenly, at a given signal, the whole of a gang working in\r\none of the claims would yell out, and jump as if the reef surrounding\r\nthem were falling. The overseer in charge would instinctively look up,\r\nwhile the boy who had given the false alarm would coolly stoop down and\r\npocket some large diamond which he had just unearthed. Many a beautiful\r\ndiamond, too, has frequently been recovered from a native’s pipe, which\r\nwas diligently being puffed with all the air of innocence, and I have\r\neven heard of goats, feeding near the floors set apart for the\r\ndepositing of “blue stuff,” being turned into accessories (after the\r\nfact!), the hair of these animals affording a hiding place for stolen\r\ndiamonds which were thus carried into the “veldt” beyond, and refound by\r\nthe thief (his day’s work being over) without any danger whatever of\r\nsearching or detective interference.\r\n\r\nThe receiver, however, is worse than the thief. The devices by which the\r\nwhite scoundrel saves his skin are quite as curious a study as those\r\nresorted to by the original thief.\r\n\r\nThis trade gradually resolved itself into a fine art as the law against\r\nit became more penal.\r\n\r\nBefore the company mania commenced at the end of 1880, and when the\r\nmines were worked by individual diggers, many unprincipled persons, both\r\nblack and white, used their digging operations and the fact of their\r\npossessing claims as cloaks to account for the possession of diamonds\r\nwhich they otherwise obtained by illicit dealing.\r\n\r\nAbout 1876 a _cause celébre_ brought this prominently before the public.\r\n\r\nAt that time claims in Bulfontein and Du Toit’s Pan cost little money in\r\ncomparison with claims in the Kimberley mine, and a great many were\r\nowned by natives and colored people. This case, which attracted great\r\npublic attention, was that of John Vogel, a colored man, tried on April\r\n22d, 1876, before his Honor, Mr. Recorder Barry, and a jury. This man\r\nwas charged with contravening section 17 of ordinance 27 of 1874: “The\r\nsaid John Vogel being then a registered claim-holder, and the said\r\ndiamond (79¾ carats weight) not being found in ground worked by him,\r\nalthough sold by him in his name as a claim-holder.”\r\n\r\nAccording to evidence brought forward it was proved that Vogel received\r\n£20 only from the white man who bought the diamond, whilst another Kafir\r\nwho accompanied him received £305 in payment for the stone, Vogel\r\nevidently lending his. name as a registered claim-holder for the sum of\r\n£20. Vogel was proved to have been largely engaged in this “trade,” and\r\non several occasions to have sold to the same buyer.\r\n\r\nHe was found guilty and sentenced to three years’ hard labor. After\r\nsentencing the prisoner, the recorder then called for the white diamond\r\nbuyer, a well-known merchant, and said: “Your own register shows that\r\nyou have been in the habit of buying from this man, by which you have\r\nencouraged him in his acts, while at the same time you have kept no\r\nbooks sufficient to prevent me from saying that your conduct is above\r\nsuspicion.”\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that even at this time opportunities were taken to evade\r\nthe law with every show of legality.\r\n\r\nSome again would lease their claims to “swell niggers” (both white and\r\nblack having an equal government right to obtain digging licenses and\r\npossess claims) with an understanding that they, the claim-holders,\r\nshould receive a percentage of the finds, at the same time well knowing\r\nthat the percentage would be a large one, most of the diamonds in fact\r\nthus obtained being stones illegally bought from natives with money\r\nthese dishonest claim-holders would advance, nominally for honest\r\nenterprise, but virtually for illicit purposes.\r\n\r\nOthers would give an extravagant reward to their native servants for\r\neach diamond they brought as a reputed find while working, which was of\r\ncourse merely another mode of buying from natives without fear of\r\ndetection.\r\n\r\nIn late years it has become a very general practice even among\r\nrespectable diggers and companies to give a percentage to native\r\nservants on the value of any diamond which they may bring.\r\n\r\nOne company at Du Toit’s Pan in particular by this means increased their\r\nreturns to such an extent that they found it paid them to promise each\r\n“Happy child of Ham” twenty-five per cent. commission on whatever gem he\r\nmight unearth. This was brought to general notice by a well-known writer\r\nin the local press in the following verses, which were much quoted at\r\nthe time:\r\n\r\n                   I would not be a digger; No,\r\n                     Nor yet an I.

Don’t you ruin yourself by\r\n  being a Mayor or a Banker, or throw away your chances by marrying a\r\n  Baroness Burdett-Coutts—or purchasing a 900 carat diamond found by an\r\n  unknown Dutch farmer on an unknown Dutch farm when there is no secrecy\r\n  about the matter from beginning to end.” “No, my beaming boy,” said\r\n  the old lady, bless her heart! “You be a Christy Minstrel, and go work\r\n  in the claims for your wages and 25 per cent.” I took the old lady’s\r\n  advice, and—all together, if you please, gentlemen]\r\n\r\n                      “I would not be an Hemperor,\r\n                        I would not be a King,\r\n                      I would not be a Hadmiral\r\n                        Or hany sich a thing;\r\n                      I wouldn’t be in Lowe’s Police\r\n                        And live inside a tent;\r\n                      I’d rather be a nigger, and\r\n                        Get 25 per cent.”\r\n\r\nTo resume, when the company mania set in, the number of individual\r\ndiggers gradually decreased. Further restrictions were also placed upon\r\nthose remaining, as well as upon the managers and lessees of companies,\r\nby the passing of a new law in 1882, which law is at present in force.\r\n\r\nBy this act the digger or lessee is compelled to make a monthly return\r\nof all his finds, in which any discrepancy is detected at once by\r\ncomparing it with a return (also required) from the various licensed\r\nbuyers of their monthly purchases; and an excessive return of diamonds,\r\nor a succession of astounding washings up from notoriously poor or\r\ninsufficiently worked ground, at once serves to arouse suspicion, and\r\nhas already in several instances led to a conviction, especially as the\r\nprivate and moral character of each digger or lessee is more or less\r\nknown to the detective department.\r\n\r\nSome white men run the risk of buying direct from natives, and to those\r\nknowing Zulu, which is the language of which all natives gain a\r\nsmattering, the conversation becomes highly amusing. The word diamond is\r\nnever mentioned; for instance, an illicit will accost a native with the\r\nquestion: “Ipi inkonyama?” (where is the calf?) The native replies if he\r\nhas no diamonds: “Inkonyama yalukile no mina” (the calf has strayed with\r\nits mother), or the white man asks: “Tzinyamazana zi kona na?” (are\r\nthere any bucks?) and the native, having some diamonds secreted about\r\nhim, replies: “Zi kona” (there are some). In this manner the secret of\r\ntheir being engaged in illicit traffic is kept from all but the\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nThese various phases of the crime, and others that I shall describe,\r\nhave been for years brought to the notice of the public by the local\r\npress. The Diamond Fields _Advertiser_, in a leading article once\r\nstated: “There is something terribly revolting about the extent of crime\r\narising out of the I. D. B. calling in all its ramifications. Inducing\r\nservants to steal, murder, perjury, receiving stolen goods, white women\r\nprostituting themselves to Kafirs for payment in diamonds, little boys\r\nemployed by mining companies taught to steal and supplied with false\r\npockets in which to conceal the gems, bribes attempted on officers of\r\nlaw, and a thousand other crimes are practiced and gloried in by gangs\r\nof ruffians, whom the law seldom reaches.”\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that many white men were or are foolish\r\nenough to buy direct from the raw native; unless the illicit buyer has\r\n“planted” his own gang of natives, or in other words educated thieves,\r\non some company to bring him all the diamonds they can steal, he is very\r\nwary. One very curious case in point came to light in 1876, when the\r\ndetective officers, searching among the “goods and chattels” of a man\r\nconvicted for I. D. B., found, from memorandums in his possession, that\r\nhe had no less than sixty natives “planted” on different claim-holders,\r\nwhose sole object was to rob and bring the diamonds to their real\r\nmaster, who had engaged them for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA diamond passed, in most instances, through four hands before it\r\nreached a legal holder.\r\n\r\n 1st. The raw Kafir—the thief.\r\n\r\n 2d.  The swell native, or tout of\r\n\r\n 3d.  The low white man, generally agent of\r\n\r\n 4th. A licensed diamond buyer.\r\n\r\nOn analyzing this series, it will be seen that the raw native, who is\r\ngenerally the worker in the mine or on the depositing floor, has only to\r\nevade the attention of the overseer to enable him to swallow or secrete\r\nabout his person any diamond he may chance to expose. The lynx-eyed\r\nobservation of his “brothers” is to him of no moment, for they are, as a\r\nrule, so true to each other that they never inform—brothers both in\r\ncolor and in crime. His work done, on returning home to his evening meal\r\nour subject’s real fun and excitement begin, in other words, the second\r\nscene of the illicit play now commences. His swell “brother” arrives,\r\ntransmutes his ill-gotten diamonds into gold, leaving him to carouse far\r\ninto the night and then “dream the happy hours away,” until the morning\r\ngives him again fresh opportunities for thieving.\r\n\r\nOur low white man, in the meantime, with perfect confidence and\r\nsecurity, is awaiting his native tout, “building castles in the air” on\r\nthe possible profit of the night’s venture.\r\n\r\nNow for the sequel, the last act of the drama. This man has an intimate\r\nfriend, a licensed diamond buyer, a more cold-blooded but less plucky\r\nrascal than himself, whose honesty (!) and respectability (!) can be\r\ngauged by the fact that he buys next morning in his office, without any\r\nhaggling and without even demanding the necessary permit, a collection\r\nof stones which he introduces in ordinary course to the trade as a\r\n“digger’s mixed parcel.” Sometimes, however, the raw native,\r\nunfortunately for himself, sells a diamond directly to the low white\r\nman, who (if the native be not a regular _customer_) takes advantage of\r\nhis ignorance and pays him in frequent instances partly in good and\r\npartly in base coin. In this way spurious bank notes, of which the\r\naccompanying engraving is a _fac-simile_, and gilt medals in imitation\r\nof sovereigns with the inscription “Gone to Hanover,” are palmed off,\r\nand get into circulation. Again, some very _honest_ licensed buyers\r\nwould advance money to others lower in the social scale, but also\r\nlicensed, who would run the risk of purchasing diamonds for them from\r\nany one, whether legally qualified to sell or not. Of course if any of\r\nthese were trapped and the stone traced, the monied men could never be\r\npunished, as all their transactions, having been with licensed men, were\r\nperfectly legal. I may mention _en passant_ that a great trade was done\r\nin gold at this time; certain well-known men, afterward company\r\npromoters and directors, trading in and selling on a Saturday night all\r\nthe gold coins they could gather together during the week, at a premium\r\nof three or four per cent., to a class of men who could have no other\r\nbut an illegal object in view. Such ramifications had this trade!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is the game as it used to be played; now with the new law there is\r\nmore difficulty, and the process is somewhat altered.\r\n\r\nThis law, passed in 1882, is more stringent than any of its\r\npredecessors. Its main feature is that the onus of proof of the legal\r\npossession of diamonds is thrown upon the individual in whose custody\r\nthey may be found, and any person within the confines of Griqualand West\r\nmay anywhere, at any time, be searched by the detective department, and\r\nif diamonds are found on his or her person must give an account of their\r\nlegal ownership or be liable to fifteen years’ imprisonment, with hard\r\nlabor. The detective department at the time when this law came into\r\nforce received information which led it to the arrest of a most\r\nnotorious illicit diamond buyer, who both in Kimberley and at\r\nJagersfontein[41] (a celebrated mine in the Free State) had suffered for\r\nthis crime. Acting on their information, the officers thought that, on\r\nsearching this man, they would make a grand haul, when much to their\r\ndisgust instead of finding diamonds galore they found simply pieces of\r\nglass most skillfully prepared in exact imitation of real stones, when\r\nof course their prize was lost, and the man, to their chagrin, had to be\r\nliberated.\r\n\r\nThese sham diamonds at first were brought out from Europe in all sizes,\r\nshapes and colors, but at the present time this internecine illicit\r\ntrade, or fight among diamond thieves themselves, is waged to such an\r\nextent that the detective department know of at least four individuals\r\non the Fields who are engaged in the manufacture of these spurious\r\nstones.\r\n\r\nFluoric acid is employed, so I am told, to partially dissolve the glass\r\nof which these are made into the shape required. As a matter of course\r\nthe sale of these sham stones when effected in Griqualand West is hushed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe man taken in by purchasing a spurious diamond of this kind fondly\r\nimagines at the time that he is buying a real although stolen diamond\r\nunder its value. He knows, if he be a licensed buyer, that he is\r\ncontravening the law in buying of an unlicensed seller, and\r\nconsequently, on finding out the deception which has been practiced upon\r\nhim, dare not give the seller into custody for obtaining money under\r\nfalse pretences. He is well aware such a proceeding would merely reveal\r\nto the public his illicit connection; again, if an unlicensed diamond\r\nbuyer, he naturally desires to keep the whole affair a secret.\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however, in the Cape Colony proper, Natal, Transvaal or\r\nthe Free State, where the operation of the act was not in force prior to\r\nrecent enactments, and the remark still applies to Natal and the\r\nTransvaal, where any one, morality being out of the question, can buy or\r\nsell a diamond legally. I use “legally” in the sense that the law cannot\r\ntouch him. Of course buying goods well knowing them to be stolen is a\r\ncrime in every civilized community, but in this particular instance,\r\nwithout the special enactments of the Cape Colony and Free State, one\r\nalmost impossible to bring home to the criminal.\r\n\r\nA curious case was tried in Beaufort West in 1884, which ended in the\r\nacquittal of the accused, a man well versed, not only in the mysteries\r\nof the I. D. B. trade, but also in the punishment attendant upon its\r\ndetection. This man offered a certain Jew residing there one of these\r\nspurious diamonds for sale. This Jew would not purchase on his own\r\njudgment, but asked a friend to value the stone for him, which after\r\nbuying on his advice for £280 he found out was merely a piece of glass\r\nnot worth a farthing. Not living, however, in Griqualand West, where an\r\nunlicensed purchase would have been a crime, which might have consigned\r\nhim to the Capetown Breakwater for fifteen years, but in the Cape\r\nColony, where no restriction was then in force, he called in the\r\nassistance of the law, charged the man with obtaining money under false\r\npretences, and the case came ultimately before Judge Dwyer at the\r\ncircuit court held in that town.\r\n\r\nThe sale by the prisoner was of course duly proved. Judge Dwyer,\r\nhowever, directed the jury that as the purchaser had been guided in his\r\nopinion by his friend, it was a question for them to decide whether he\r\nhad been misled or not by the statement of the accused. The jury, as I\r\nsaid before, acquitted the prisoner.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly a curious phase in this glass, or in thieves Latin\r\n“snyde diamond,” question, or, as I term it, in this internecine\r\nstruggle for unlawful gain, that in this province neither the\r\nmanufacturer nor the possessor of these spurious articles can be brought\r\nto justice. It is simply with them a game of “heads I win, tails you\r\nlose.”\r\n\r\nThe arts and sciences were also called into play to forward the ends of\r\nthis nefarious trade.\r\n\r\nThe science of chemistry was even as far back as 1872 requisitioned by\r\nboth legal and illegal sellers of diamonds. It had been discovered that\r\nthe boiling of yellow stones in nitric acid would give them a frosted\r\nwhite appearance, and by this means increase their apparent value by\r\ntwenty to forty shillings a carat, according to the size of the diamond\r\noperated upon.\r\n\r\nMany very knowing ones were taken in by this at the time, _the_ diamond\r\nbuyer of the day, one Moritz Unger, even falling a victim to the\r\ndeception. During the past thirteen years this imposition has been\r\nspasmodically revived, although at the time (1872) it was thought that\r\nthe exposure would once and forever warn the diamond burner that his\r\n“little game was up.”\r\n\r\nAlthough no community can hope to succeed whose prosperity depends upon\r\nunlawful enterprise, yet it is a fact that this new law, although it has\r\nfailed to diminish diamond stealing one iota, has yet driven away the\r\nvery men who formerly used to extravagantly patronize the retail stores,\r\nhotels, and theatres of the place, whilst Capetown and Port Elizabeth\r\nuntil quite recently (session of 1885) reaped the profits of this\r\ndisgraceful and debasing trade.\r\n\r\nImmediately on the promulgation of this law (48, 1882) the detective\r\ndepartment was stimulated to fresh energy, which was shown by rash and\r\nindiscreet action. For a month or two the passenger coaches leaving for\r\nPort Elizabeth and Capetown were searched at Alexandersfontein, a noted\r\nhostelry about five miles distant from Kimberley, and the luggage of the\r\npassengers overhauled. On one occasion this indignity was thrust upon\r\nthe Bishop of the Free State, the Bishop of the Transvaal and the Hon.\r\nA. Stead, who were all traveling by the same coach to Capetown. I\r\nbelieve I am correct in stating that only on one occasion was any arrest\r\never made. This outburst of detective enthusiasm, however, soon\r\nexhausted itself, and passengers now leave Kimberley as heretofore,\r\nwithout let or hindrance, either by coach or rail. At this time, the\r\npassage to the Colony being dangerous, and the outlet through the Free\r\nState being considered insecure, the illicit trade was removed to\r\nChristiana, in the Transvaal, and diamonds run in that direction were\r\nshipped through Natal.\r\n\r\nWhen the judges in the Free State, however, gave a decided opinion that\r\ntheir law extended only to acknowledged diggings, and trapping was\r\nabolished by the Volksraad in that country, the trade was again brought\r\nto our very door, just as suddenly to recede when the Free State passed,\r\nin the last session of their Volksraad, a diamond law containing the\r\n_onus probandi_ clause.\r\n\r\nA new village called Free Town sprang up on the boundary, a mile or two\r\ndistant from Du Toit’s Pan, inhabited chiefly by men whose acquaintance\r\nwith the diamond law of Griqualand West had been of too intimate a\r\ncharacter, while both there and at Oliphansfontein, another Free State\r\nvillage close by Griqualand West, diamonds were openly bought and sold.\r\nOne or two Dutch homesteads in the neighborhood over the border, within\r\neasy reach of our mines, were rented by gangs of Griqualand West\r\nillicits in order to ply their trade with ease and impunity.\r\n\r\nThe detective department was again seized with another fit of zeal, and\r\nmany mounted men patroled the roads to these villages, searching all\r\ncomers and goers, whether male or female, whom they suspected of\r\nconnection with this traffic. In spite of this diamonds were “run the\r\nblockade” in large quantities. The I. D. B. fraternity were not lacking\r\nin devices. The book post conveyed many a parcel. A large hole was cut\r\nin the pages of some novel or ready reckoner and the space filled with\r\ndiamonds carefully packed. The parcel being properly wrapped and posted\r\nattracted no attention from the postal authorities.\r\n\r\nKafirs were employed as runners at night, in the day white horsemen\r\nnicknamed “troopers,” were paid to face the risks, the diamonds they\r\ncarried being wrapped in lead so that they could be dropped in the grass\r\nif danger loomed in the distance and then recovered again at leisure.\r\nOthers of this ilk again having swallowed the precious stones ran the\r\ngauntlet safely, in open defiance of the detectives, with the diamonds\r\nin their stomachs. Horses were fed with balls of meal containing\r\ndiamonds, driven across the border before the very eyes of the\r\ndetectives, where, in course of nature, the diamonds were restored to\r\nthe hands of their keepers. Dogs, too, were starved until they bolted\r\nlumps of meat in which diamonds were imbedded. The value of these poor\r\nbrutes not being great enough to save their lives their stomachs were\r\nsoon ripped open on their arrival at Free Town, over the border. The\r\ntails of oxen and wings of fowls were often utilized, passing the border\r\nunsuspected and unexamined, while carrier pigeons instead of carrying\r\nvaluable information were used to transport valuable diamonds to Free\r\nTown, in the Orange Free State, and Christiana, in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nAstonishing ingenuity in trying to run illicit diamonds out of the\r\nterritory was displayed by some. One man named Phillips, an instance in\r\npoint, was found guilty by the special court of illegal possession. The\r\nreports of the case supply the accompanying particulars.\r\n\r\nPhillips showed great cleverness. He had the heels of his boots made\r\nhollow and filled up with rough diamonds, sealing them down with wax.\r\nThe handles of his traveling trunk were also made to remove, empty\r\nspaces behind being constructed for the same purpose. In fact the man\r\nthought himself safe enough. The detective department, however,\r\nsuspecting him, and failing in all efforts to trap, engaged a man to\r\nform a _pseudo_ friendship with him, or in other words, to play the part\r\nof a Judas. To keep up the deception and disarm suspicion this secret\r\nagent was rushed and searched by a well-known detective, thus creating\r\nan apparent reason for a fellow feeling between the two. The result can\r\neasily be guessed—Convict No. — for ten long years to come has now\r\nseclusion and opportunity enough afforded him by the government to\r\nponder over the folly of confiding too much in his fellow creatures.\r\nThese boots were exhibited in the Capetown Industrial Exhibition of 1884\r\nand excited much interest.\r\n\r\nI have learned since, however, that similar devices were used in\r\nAustralia during the gold mania.\r\n\r\nThe dishonest licensed buyer at this time adopted another dodge. In\r\norder to evade the law, show the detective department a correct monthly\r\nreturn as regards weight of diamonds, and so avoid suspicion, he would\r\nkeep on hand a large stock of boart nominally accounted as diamonds, but\r\nworth some three shillings to five shillings only per carat. Thus,\r\nsupposing he bought a large illicit stone, of course under its value, he\r\nwould throw away a corresponding weight of boart, which he could easily\r\nafford to lose. By this means he was enabled to produce a correct\r\nregister to the authorities and have as well the proper weight of\r\ndiamonds on hand supposing the detective department at any moment\r\ndemanded a search.\r\n\r\nBut toward the end of 1884 and the beginning of 1885 the so-called\r\n“legal” traffic at Free Town and Oliphansfontein, in the Free State, was\r\nseriously interfered with.\r\n\r\nA number of desperadoes formed themselves into a gang to attack and rob\r\nthe buyers in the Free State, the argument by which they justified\r\nthemselves being that it was nothing but fair play to rob men of\r\nproperty which they had no right to possess, and thus mete out to such\r\ncharacters, unofficial, but at the same time retributive justice. In\r\nother words, they knew the diamonds which they might steal were simply\r\nillegal purchases from thieves working for companies in Griqualand West\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nThe head of this gang was an ex-police sergeant and detective named\r\nMays. He committed many highway robberies on the border, but diamonds\r\nwere his sole object, he despised money and other valuables as booty\r\nbeneath his notice.\r\n\r\nThese, he argued, would simply reduce him to the level of an ordinary\r\nthief, which he prided himself he was not. The men he robbed were always\r\ntreated well, and generally had the opportunity given them of buying\r\nback their diamonds at a cheap rate, which, knowing full well they\r\nthemselves were thieves, they generally did, not courting publicity.\r\n\r\nThis was not always the case. A celebrated trial at Boshof, in the Free\r\nState, in March 1885, showed otherwise. One of these gentry who\r\n“speculated” in that country, named Kemp, caring nothing for the\r\nexposure of his nefarious trade, on being robbed near Oliphansfontein of\r\n2,073 carats weight of diamonds, worth £4,000, which he was taking to\r\nCapetown, gave such information to the Free State authorities as led to\r\nthe capture, trial, and conviction of the thieves, who proved to be\r\nrival “speculators” in the same line of business. So far, Kemp missed\r\nhis object, which was more the recovery of his diamonds than the\r\npunishment of the highwaymen. The revelations on the trial were simply\r\nstartling, implicating as they did supposed honorable men in Griqualand\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Reitz, on sentencing the culprits, who were all found\r\nguilty, did so in plain words. Addressing each in turn, after asking\r\nthem whether they had anything to say, said in Dutch, of which the\r\nfollowing is a literal translation (to Scotty Smith): “It is a pity that\r\na man of your appearance should deal in stolen property. There is no\r\nexcuse for you; it is a gross crime. The boundary line is getting\r\ndangerous for our people. It is quite an accident that Kemp was not\r\nkilled. I took you for a man who knew better. I will punish you\r\nseverely.”\r\n\r\nTo Leigh he said: “You are a sergeant in the police, you are a protector\r\nof the public, and you come into another land to commit a robbery. You\r\ncome with a dished-up story; better you had not told such a thing. You,\r\na sergeant in the police, using a knobkerrie and revolver. You might, in\r\nthe strict letter of the law, be hanged; but now-a-days a more lenient\r\nview is taken. You were stopped by an accident from being hauled up for\r\nmurder.”\r\n\r\nTo Herman: “You are a mean little scoundrel, acting in that way whilst a\r\nfellow co-religionist was being robbed, and perhaps all but murdered;\r\nsuch a little fellow you are. You get used for paltry, mean things, and\r\nhere you assist in a mean way in a serious crime.”\r\n\r\nTo Welford: “The evidence against you, I think, is conclusive, although\r\nyou have a right to say there is a conspiracy against you; those can\r\nbelieve you who like. I believe you are the man who started the whole\r\nthing. I would not wonder if you first originated the matter. You see\r\nthe result of commencing by virtually doing a business of theft, because\r\nyou think the law here could not touch you. Such action leads me to be\r\nmore severe in your case. I think you are all sensible people; you knew\r\nit all well; there is no plea of ignorance.”\r\n\r\nThe four prisoners were then sentenced to four years’ imprisonment each;\r\nwith Scotty Smith and Arthur Gerald Leigh twenty-five lashes in\r\naddition.\r\n\r\nSo far as Kemp was concerned, the chief justice, adding injury to\r\ninsult, refused his application for the return of the diamonds, giving\r\nas his reason that “Griqualand West was a civilized country with\r\ncompetent courts, and if these were his diamonds he could go to\r\nKimberley, prove them to be his lawful property, and no doubt get them.”\r\n\r\nKemp, as Chief Justice Reitz advised him, in the following December\r\nbrought an action against the chief of the Griqualand West detective\r\ndepartment for the recovery of the diamonds, which resulted in a\r\njudgment of “absolution from the instance” with costs, the diamonds\r\nremaining in the care of the detective department. Judge President\r\nBuchanan, in giving this decision, distinctly stated that he did not\r\nbelieve Kemp, but allowed him another opportunity, if he chose, to prove\r\nthe diamonds were not stolen property.\r\n\r\nKemp then noted an appeal, which came before the appeal court in January\r\n1886, at Capetown. The Premier, Mr. Upington, who appeared for the\r\ndetective department, said there was no proof that the diamonds were\r\nKemp’s. He was another’s servant—a noted Free State (!) diamond\r\nbuyer—had never been in possession of the diamonds, and was not entitled\r\nto sue. Mr. Leonard, the attorney general under the former (Scanlan)\r\nministry, who appeared for Kemp, said he “would not ask the court to\r\nbelieve, as was attempted in the court below, that a thief could recover\r\nstolen property, but there was no proof that the diamonds in question\r\nwere stolen.” The court, in giving judgment, held that there was no\r\nproof that the diamonds were Kemp’s property and dismissed the appeal,\r\nand the diamonds were forfeited to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThis decision was hailed with delight by the mining community, as it\r\ntended to overthrow a clique of _pseudo_-legal and illegal buyers, who\r\nhad long worked in concert; therefore, at the present time, the\r\nTransvaal and Natal are the only territories where transactions in\r\nstolen diamonds are capable of not being criminally brought home to\r\nthose engaged in them.\r\n\r\nThis so far is a faithful account of the I. D. B. trade and its various\r\nramifications.\r\n\r\nSir Jacobus de Wet, when recorder of our high court, once solemnly\r\ntermed this trade the “canker-worm of the community.” The truth of his\r\nwords time has over and over again but too truly established, as this\r\ncanker-worm is gnawing away the very vitals of Diamond Field society.\r\n\r\nTo fully explain my meaning, men in some instances, I am sorry to say,\r\noccupying a fair status in commerce, mining or society are introduced to\r\nthe new arrival; they have an ostensible business, and nothing in their\r\nmanner would betray, save to one endowed with all the concentrated\r\nastuteness of Scotland Yard, that they were mixed up directly or\r\nindirectly with the nefarious business. They are not incapable of\r\nshowing acts of kindness to the tyro on the Fields even without an\r\nulterior motive, and the new-comer does not find out the real character\r\nof his kind acquaintances very often until he has been the recipient of\r\nfavors from them, when even if he would wish once for all to sever his\r\nconnection with them, custom and gratitude alike tend to prevent the\r\nseparation. Positive proof of their being implicated in the traffic,\r\nfrom the very nature of the case, is not forthcoming, and so the young\r\nman gives his friends the benefit of the doubt, continues the\r\nacquaintance, and though he may not be actually drawn into absolute\r\ncrime or abnormal vice, is certain to prove a living example of the\r\ntruthful saying: “Evil communications corrupt good manners.”\r\n\r\nBusiness relations too, like poverty, make us acquainted with strange\r\nbed-fellows in this part of the world, and the well-paying client,\r\npatient or customer is not readily rejected, or shown that his fees or\r\npayments are unacceptable, without so deliberate an insult as most men\r\nwould shrink from offering, without stronger grounds than the suspicion\r\nthat they are not entirely clean-handed. Hence, before a man knows where\r\nhe is, he may have become the daily associate of unconvicted criminals.\r\nMen who themselves would not risk any direct meddling with the traffic\r\nare strongly tempted by offers of large percentages for the loan of\r\nmoney, which they may shrewdly suspect, though they do not _know_, will\r\nbe devoted to the purposes of the illicit traffic: needless to say, such\r\npersons are morally accessories before the fact. I have elsewhere\r\nmentioned how those who in former days were themselves recipients of\r\nstolen diamonds are in some instances now the loudest in condemning\r\ntheir successors in the business, and this is brought forward as an\r\nargument to prove that free trade in diamonds is justifiable, an obvious\r\nand pitiable fallacy which I am only too sorry to say imposes upon many.\r\nThe disgrace attached to the jail-bird in other parts of the world,\r\nhowever truly he may have repented of the wickedness that he had\r\ncommitted, here amidst the great body of the population is rarely\r\nimposed on the I. D. B. who has served his time, and men of\r\ncomparatively high standing feel no shame in hobnobbing with them in\r\npublic bars. While I would be the last man in the world to cast in a\r\nman’s teeth the sins which he has expiated in prison, or to frustrate\r\nhim in his effort to earn an honest living, yet it is manifest that\r\nthere is an opposite extreme, and that to exalt a convicted felon into a\r\nmartyr, or even to make him a bosom companion, can scarcely be regarded\r\nas a sign of high integrity.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt the receivers of stolen diamonds have made the most\r\nmoney out of the mines. There is no moral difference between the\r\nWhitechapel old clo’ Jew who “runs the klips,” the Hebrew swell who\r\nkeeps his carriage at the West End, by purchasing diamonds at half their\r\nvalue in Hatton Garden, the Christian who lends money for the purchase\r\nof stolen goods, and who every Sunday thanks God he is not as other men\r\nare, and the respectable (?) colonial merchant “buying on the quiet.”\r\nThey are all as much thieves as the veriest pickpocket of St. Giles’.\r\nThe moral condition of the diamond fields is such that, although a man\r\nmay be known to be habitually engaged in _the trade_, he is openly\r\nreceived until the jail’s portals are some day suddenly thrown back at\r\nthe bidding of the special court to receive yet another victim, an\r\nexample of the old, old story.\r\n\r\nIn a succeeding chapter I shall give some individual cases illustrative\r\nof my theory, in the next I shall deal with the treatment that this\r\nincreasing disease has demanded and received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\nDIAMOND LEGISLATION.—RESUME OF SIR H. BARKLY’S PROCLAMATIONS.—EPITOME OF\r\nTHE ORDINANCES OF THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL OF GRIQUALAND WEST.—REVIEW OF\r\n   THE ACTS PASSED BY THE CAPE ASSEMBLY.—DESCRIPTION OF THE TRAPPING\r\n   SYSTEM.—ADOPTION OF THE “ONUS PROBANDI” CLAUSE BY THE ORANGE FREE\r\n         STATE.—THE SEARCHING DEPARTMENT.—THE COMPOUND SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the diamond mines of Griqualand West, viz. Du Toit’s Pan,\r\nBulfontein, De Beer’s and Colesberg Kopje, (now the Kimberley mine), got\r\ninto full work, diamond diggers soon found out that they were being\r\nrobbed to an enormous extent. Unfortunately but too many white men were\r\nto be found ready to receive the stolen diamonds from the thieves, who,\r\nat all events in those days, were almost exclusively natives.[42] A\r\nstrange infatuation seems always to have possessed those engaged in the\r\npursuit of “the trade” as it is euphemistically termed, which even the\r\nstringent penalty of a possible fifteen years’ hard labor, the\r\nculmination of repeated legislation, does not seem to have sufficed to\r\novercome. The first attempt to put a stop to these robberies by\r\nlegislation was contained in a proclamation issued by Sir H. Barkly, on\r\nMay 30th, 1872, in which every unauthorized buyer or seller was made\r\nliable to a fine not exceeding three times the value of the diamond or\r\ndiamonds so bought, and in default of payment to imprisonment with or\r\nwithout hard labor for any period not exceeding two years.\r\n\r\nSoon after, further precautionary measures were introduced, and the\r\ntraffic in diamonds between the hours of sunrise and sunset and on\r\nSundays was forbidden (_vide_ government notice No. 69, July 29th,\r\n1872). On Aug. 10th of the same year, Sir Henry Barkly issued a further\r\nproclamation, diamond stealing by natives and the purchase by\r\nunprincipled white men having immensely increased, in fact having become\r\nat this time even the curse of the Fields. By this proclamation, any\r\ndealer in wines, spirits, or malt liquors was unable to hold a license\r\nto trade in diamonds. This was amended on Sept. 17th, canteen-keepers\r\nonly being disqualified, and not wholesale dealers. There was a further\r\nenactment that no person could be registered as the holder of a claim,\r\nunless he produced a certificate from a magistrate or justice of the\r\npeace certifying to his character; this, however, was always a mere\r\nform, and was never refused. Provision was also made for the\r\nregistration of all servants, while power was given to any master,\r\nwithout the assistance of a constable, or for any constable without a\r\nwarrant, to search the person, residence and property of any servant\r\nwithin two hours of the time he left the claim or sorting table; but on\r\nSept. 17th this proviso was amended, and it was made lawful for a master\r\nto search his servant at any time whatever. If diamonds were found upon\r\nhim, it was presumed that they were his master’s, and the punishment to\r\nwhich the servant was liable was imprisonment with or without hard labor\r\nfor any period not exceeding twelve months, or to receive any number of\r\nlashes not exceeding fifty, or to such imprisonment and such whipping.\r\n\r\nAt the time this proclamation was issued native labor was in great\r\ndemand on the fields, and consequently the power given to the master by\r\nlaw was seldom if ever exercised, as he knew the almost certain result\r\nwould be the loss of all his servants. A change was made by this\r\nproclamation of Aug. 10th, 1872, so far as unauthorized buyers were\r\nconcerned, their punishment upon conviction being fixed at a fine not\r\nexceeding £100 sterling, or to imprisonment with or without hard labor\r\nfor any period not exceeding six months. The crime of inducing servants\r\nto steal was punished more severely. Lashes not exceeding fifty were\r\nprovided for in the proclamation, and the imprisonment increased to a\r\nperiod not exceeding twelve months, or to such imprisonment and such\r\nwhipping. Many white men received lashes under this clause, and amongst\r\nothers a German, who on coming out of prison, retired to his native\r\ncountry with over £30,000!\r\n\r\nThe increasing desire for drink among natives was considered by the\r\nauthorities in those days one of the greatest causes of the development\r\nof their thievish propensities, and the canteen keeper who bought a\r\ndiamond of a native, or took diamonds in payment or pledge for liquor,\r\nin addition to the punishment already stated, forfeited his license and\r\nbecame incompetent to hold one in the future. A further discretionary\r\npower was given to the court by which any such person might be\r\nconvicted, of forfeiting his right to any claims and expelling him from\r\nthe territory; but the last proviso was laughed at by men who had\r\ncontravened this law, as no punishment for returning to the province had\r\never been inserted by the framers. If stringent laws had been properly\r\ndrafted and enforced in the early days of the Fields, the abominable\r\nillicit traffic might have been nipped in the bud.\r\n\r\nA great deal of animosity toward the natives existed about this period.\r\nPart of this feeling was originated, I think, from many white men not\r\npossessed of claims being jealous of their black brethren digging at Du\r\nToit’s Pan and Bulfontein, while the facility for dealing in stolen\r\ndiamonds, afforded by their possessing a digger’s license, was also a\r\nfactor in the ill-will felt and expressed.\r\n\r\nA great mass meeting was held in the Market Square, Kimberley, on\r\nFriday, July 19th, 1872, to bring pressure to bear upon the three\r\ncommissioners who administered the government, and get them to take away\r\nall claim licenses from black or colored men.\r\n\r\nTwo of these gentlemen, weakly desirous of popularity, gave way to the\r\ngeneral outcry and suspended all claim licenses to natives by a\r\nproclamation issued on July 24th, which contained a reservation\r\ncertainly, (which may be taken for what it is worth) allowing the issue\r\nof such licenses on production from the various digger committees of\r\ncertificates of character and fitness; but this was a prerogative they\r\nwere little likely to exercise owing to the strong feeling then\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nJohn Cyprian Thompson, to whom I allude elsewhere, the dissentient, a\r\ngood lawyer and a thorough Englishman, did not compromise himself by\r\njoining in this most illiberal proclamation. The subsequent action of\r\nSir Henry Barkly tended to prove the correctness of Mr. Thompson’s\r\nopinion, for as soon as the proclamation reached Capetown his excellency\r\ncanceled it by another of Aug. 10th, 1872. In this he stated that “as it\r\nis inconsistent with justice that persons against whom no specific\r\ncharges have been brought should be deprived of their rights and\r\nproperties, I do hereby revoke, cancel, and make void the said\r\nproclamation, and do declare that the same shall be of no force or\r\neffect whatever, and that all licenses suspended under and by virtue\r\nthereof shall be returned and the holders thereof placed, as far as\r\npossible, in the same position as if the said proclamation had not been\r\nissued.”\r\n\r\nThe question of granting licenses to natives, and other matters of the\r\nsame kind, then attracted little attention from government until some\r\ntime after Governor Southey’s arrival, when the due constitution of our\r\nown legislative council having taken place, an ordinance was passed (No.\r\n21 of 1874) dealing more strictly with licensed dealers and brokers.\r\nDealers’ licenses were increased, at the suggestion of certain of them\r\nwho thought by this means to monopolize the trade, to £50 and brokers’\r\nto £25 per annum; dealers were obliged to buy in licensed offices, and\r\nbrokers could not get a license without a magistrate’s certificate,\r\nproving that they were not under tutelage, and producing two sureties.\r\nBy another short Act (No. 31 of 1874) diamond dealers were compelled,\r\nunder a penalty of £50 or in default three months’ imprisonment, to\r\nproperly register and record all their purchases.\r\n\r\nAgain, while Sir J. D. Barry was acting administrator, another ordinance\r\nwas passed (No. 4 of 1877) repealing 21 and 31 of 1874, re-enacting the\r\nmain clauses but increasing the maximum punishment for a first offense\r\nto a fine of £500 and three years’ imprisonment, and for a second to\r\n£1,000 and seven years.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting point to observe in connection with the diamond\r\ntrade ordinances is the gradual increase in their stringency, obviously\r\nthe outcome of, and in direct ratio to, the growth of this illicit\r\ntraffic; to bear this out, in 1880, when Mr. Rose Innes was\r\nadministrator, the punishment of this crime was again increased to a\r\nmaximum of five years’ imprisonment and £500 fine for the first, and ten\r\nyears and £1,000 for the second offense, with six and twelve months in\r\naddition respectively if the fines were not paid.\r\n\r\nI was vice-president of the legislative council of Griqualand West when\r\nthis ordinance (No. 8 of 1880) was under discussion. At the time it\r\nseemed monstrous to me (these cases being left to the discretion of a\r\nsingle magistrate) that on the opinion of one man, without a jury, a\r\nfellow creature, possibly innocent, might be consigned to prison for ten\r\nlong years. I spoke strongly on the matter, but it was argued that with\r\na jury, the illicit traffic having so many ramifications (as the Spanish\r\nproverb has it, “by the parson’s skirts the devil gets into the\r\nbelfry”), it would be almost impossible to gain a conviction.\r\n\r\nTo meet this emergency I proposed a three-judge court (the same\r\nprinciple that has since been adopted in Ireland with reference to the\r\n“Crimes act”), which suggestion was supported by the government, and now\r\nunder the title of “The Special Court” criminals of this class appear\r\nbefore a just and strictly impartial tribunal\r\n\r\nIn 1880 (previous to high court with three judges being constituted) a\r\nspecial magistrate was appointed to act in conjunction with the\r\nKimberley and Du Toit’s Pan magistrates to form the special court, but\r\nsince our high court has been formed, and the Diamond Trade Act 48 of\r\n1882 has become law, this office has been done away with, and one of the\r\nthree judges now sits in turn as president of the special court.\r\n\r\nThe act just mentioned (48 of 1882) when it passed the Cape parliament\r\nmight have been at once extended to the whole colony, but it was\r\nenforced by the government in Griqualand West only, consequently any one\r\ncould buy or possess diamonds with impunity in the Cape Colony proper.\r\nAs again in the Free State, although an ordinance was passed in the same\r\nyear (No. 3 of 1882) of even greater severity, providing maximum\r\npenalties for its contravention of £2,000 fine, twenty years’ hard\r\nlabor, 100 lashes, and last but not least the power to expel from the\r\nState all moral lepers in the shape of persons convicted outside the\r\nState in Griqualand West of I. D. B., their judges interpreted it not to\r\nextend beyond six miles from proclaimed diamond diggings; therefore so\r\nfar as that State was concerned the free trade in diamonds was owing to\r\nan omission in and not a permission by the law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FREE TOWN.[43]\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe judges there seem to have been actuated by the sound legal principle\r\nthat penal laws should be strictly or rather restrictively construed.\r\n\r\nAgain in Natal and the Transvaal no law connected with diamonds existed\r\nexcept one in the latter State, forbidding the purchase of diamonds or\r\ngold without a special license, or from a native, under a penalty of\r\nfive years’ imprisonment, £1,000 fine and confiscation, an ordinance\r\npractically null and void, for these might be purchased without question\r\nfrom any white man on paying a duty of five per cent.; consequently the\r\nmain illicit trade was done outside the confines of Griqualand West,\r\nwhere there was no danger of interference from the detectives when\r\ndiamonds once were safely transported across the border.\r\n\r\nThe Volksraad, in the Transvaal, I ought not to omit mentioning, also\r\npassed a clause in their extradition laws against all offenders charged\r\nwith contravening our diamond act, which, however, they expunged on May\r\n26th, 1886, out of pique, because the Cape colonial government would not\r\ntake off the tax on tobacco and produce; consequently Christiana, a town\r\nsituated close to the borders of Griqualand West, is again the seat of\r\nmuch illicit trade.\r\n\r\nNatal, however, like the Transvaal, wants some good “quid pro quo”\r\nbefore it will assist the Cape in suppressing this infamous trade.\r\nDuring the session of the legislative council 1885–86, when the\r\n“Post-office law amendment bill” was under discussion, in which power\r\nwas asked to detain and open certain letters, great and unhappily\r\nsuccessful opposition was made by certain members, Mr. Binnes, a rising\r\nlegislator, terming the clause this “jesuitical clause,” and two other\r\nmembers expressing surprise at the “mean, sneaking power” which the\r\ngovernment by a “sidewind” wished to gain. For a time at least,\r\ntherefore, Natal has converted herself into a “thieves’ highway.” Again\r\nin the present session, 1886–87, a similar bill has been thrown out.\r\nThis conduct on the part of Natal politicians is attributed to some\r\nill-feeling with respect to custom dues, and was wholly unjustifiable,\r\nso much so that the sister colony by thus protecting the leeches that\r\nsuck the life’s blood of our great industry, lays herself open to the\r\ncharge of wilfully becoming _particeps criminis_.\r\n\r\nThese causes led to the most palpable, systematic and barefaced\r\nrobberies, as may be readily imagined. So long as the Kafir thieves and\r\nwhite fences could in half an hour drive from Kimberley to the Free\r\nState, where no _onus probandi_ of legal possession lay with the holders\r\nof diamonds, and whence a seaport could be reached without passing\r\nthrough any part of Griqualand West, the trade continued to thrive. Now,\r\nhowever, the injustice under which we were laboring is greatly\r\ndiminished, first by the Free State Volksraad passing a law during the\r\nlast session containing the much desired _onus probandi_ clause, and\r\nsecond by our own parliament awakening to a sense of its duty and\r\npassing an act applying restrictions over the whole colony.[44]\r\n\r\nThe principal points in the Diamond Trade Act of 1882 are: (1st) That it\r\nshall not be lawful for any person to have in his possession any rough\r\nor uncut diamond, without being able to legally account for it; (2d) the\r\npunishment of those convicted under the act is increased to a maximum of\r\nfifteen years, the governor having at the termination of five years the\r\npower to remit the remainder of the sentence, on condition of the\r\nprisoner leaving the territory, with the alternative that if he return\r\nhe can be rearrested and imprisoned for a term equal to the portion of\r\nhis sentence unexpired at the time of his release; (3d) that none but a\r\nlicensed person can export or import diamonds; (4th) that the chief of\r\nthe detective department or police can stop any package in the\r\npost-office supposed to contain diamonds illegally, and warn the owner\r\nto be present at the examination, when if any unregistered diamonds be\r\nfound, the owner is liable to the full penalty already mentioned; (5th)\r\nthat a person finding a diamond must deliver it to the government, but\r\nto receive ten per cent. of the proceeds when the diamond is sold; (6th)\r\nthat power under warrant is granted to detective officers and policemen\r\nto enter and search any suspected places, and in any highway, street, or\r\npublic place, to arrest and search any suspected person, the _onus\r\nprobandi_ of legal possession resting on the suspected party if any\r\ndiamonds be found; (7th) that diamond cutters must be licensed; (8th)\r\nthat special permits must be obtained for washing débris; (9th) that\r\nevery person is required by law to keep a register and to forward it\r\nmonthly for examination to the chief of the detective department; (10th)\r\nthat a special board be formed for protecting mining interests; (11th)\r\nthat an accessory either before or after any contravention of the act\r\ncan be charged and dealt with as a principal; (12th) and that a\r\nregistration fee of one-half per cent. be levied on all exported\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nThese are the main additional clauses introduced into the law which is\r\nnow in force; the remaining are not so important and refer to minor\r\nrequirements, which have been reintroduced from repealed ordinances.\r\n\r\nTo go back a little, an ordinance was passed in July, 1880, when Mr.\r\nRose Innes was administrator, providing for the searching of natives and\r\nothers employed in the various mines. Owing to the want of unanimity\r\nbetween the four mining boards, no action was taken under this act until\r\nFeb. 1883, when the various mines were inclosed with wire fencing,\r\nsearching houses at different outlets built, and a staff of men engaged\r\nto act as searchers.\r\n\r\nThese remained until February, 1884, under the detective department, the\r\nexpenditure falling upon the different mines, the half per cent.\r\nregistration fee on exported diamonds and the proceeds of those captured\r\ndefraying a portion. The searching officers when under the detective\r\ndepartment were excessive in number and extravagantly paid. The number\r\nand expense was ridiculous, eighty (80) searchers were employed in the\r\nfour mines, and the expense was nearly two thousand pounds per month,\r\nfor which they were supposed to examine all persons, white or black,\r\nleaving the mines, but this was done so hurriedly that the inspection\r\nbecame a mere farce. In January, 1886, the chief of the detective\r\ndepartment reporting on this department gave it as his decided opinion\r\nthat it had no effect on the theft of diamonds, and advised its\r\ndiscontinuance. Since this was written, however, great improvement in\r\nthis department has taken place under Major Maxwell.\r\n\r\nI am able to give my readers some statistics comprising the searching\r\nand detective expense of the four mines which are interesting, showing\r\nthe cost of the detective department for the first twenty-seven months\r\nafter the promulgation of the act, and that of the searching department\r\nfor twenty-two months after its inauguration:\r\n\r\n          September, 1882, to November, 1884.\r\n          1 Registration Fees                 £38,145 14s. 2d.\r\n          3 Detectives’ Salaries               24,906 19s. 6d.\r\n          2 Captured Diamonds (sold)           30,671 12s. 3d.\r\n          4 Cost of Trap Stones (net)           4,011  8s. 7d.\r\n          5 Bonuses to traps                    2,130  9s. 0d.\r\n          March, 1883, to November, 1884.\r\n          1 Searching Department              £39,578 14s. 6d.\r\n\r\nI have good authority for stating that the value of the diamonds seized\r\nin searching amounted to less than £200. It will, however, be argued\r\nthat “prevention is better than cure,” and that the searching was to\r\nprevent the abstraction of diamonds from the mines. This, however, it\r\nfailed to do, it only altered the channel by which they passed from the\r\nelevated to the underground railway, or in other words, from the pockets\r\nof the Kafirs to their stomachs.[45] In February, 1885, the various\r\nmining boards took the searching arrangements under their own\r\nsupervision, and retrenchment is now the order of the day.\r\n\r\nWhen Act 48 of 1882 was before the Cape assembly, its provisions were\r\nminutely discussed. Being at that time one of the members for Kimberley,\r\nI had the opportunity of bringing my influence to bear. I did not oppose\r\nexemplary penalties being enacted for this increasing crime, but I\r\ndecidedly objected, and in this I was supported by Mr. Saul Solomon, to\r\nflogging being inflicted for what was not a crime against the person but\r\nagainst property. I was so far successful that such brutal ideas were\r\nexpunged from the act. Mr. Scanlan (now Sir T. Scanlan), who was then\r\npremier, kindly assisted me, though I was at the time in opposition, in\r\npassing through the house the “ticket of leave” system, which I\r\nintroduced into the second clause. In getting this inserted, I acted on\r\nthe assurance of some diggers, and these, too, the most determined to\r\nstamp out I. D. B., that the object of their wish for increased length\r\nof punishment was not revenge for the loss that they had sustained (for\r\nwhich motive they were credited by many), but a desire to rid the place,\r\nfor as long a period as possible, of men who were reducing Griqualand\r\nWest simply to a hot-bed of thieves.\r\n\r\nI should not be giving my readers an idea of all the legal machinery\r\nbrought to bear in order to root out and bring to justice this class of\r\ncriminal if I were to omit a description of the trapping system as now\r\nin vogue. The detective department is one entailing immense\r\nresponsibility on its chief. When it is remembered that “the thief, the\r\nrobber, the assassin, the harlot, the murderer, and every other\r\nconceivable criminal flourishes” on this sneaking crime, it may be\r\nasked, seeing none are trapped but those who are well known to be in\r\n“the trade,” why the parrot cry of its un-English-like character is\r\nraised by many against so necessary a routine.\r\n\r\nThe detective service consists of a chief, about twenty-five natives,\r\nchosen for their shrewdness, nine white men, known to the public as\r\ndetectives, and several engaged on special secret service. These\r\nofficers are all well paid, not only to secure the services of reliable\r\nmen, but to compensate them for the risk they run, though as a rule, the\r\ndiamond thief is the veriest of cowards.\r\n\r\nWhen a man is daily seen drinking, gambling and riotously living,\r\nwithout any visible means of subsistence, when his character can be\r\ngauged by the company that he keeps, and the detective department\r\nreceives private information, _that_ man is trapped; but not before he\r\nhas bought three times do the detectives “run him in.”\r\n\r\nSuch, at least, is the system, as it has been explained to me by those\r\nwho should be thoroughly acquainted with it. On the other hand, I know\r\nof a case of a young ex-officer of volunteers, who in a drunken moment\r\nbought a stone not intended for him, and was brought to trial. The\r\ndetectives all swore that he had never, so far as they were aware,\r\npurchased an illicit diamond before in his life, and the court, taking\r\nthat view, sentenced him to only eighteen months’ imprisonment. He was,\r\nmoreover, released before the expiration of his sentence.\r\n\r\nThe plan is as follows: The native who acts as the “trap” is thoroughly\r\nsearched and then supplied with a diamond by the department. He starts\r\non “his mission of mercy” followed by two or three detectives, who place\r\nthemselves in different positions, so as to command a view of the\r\npremises where the transaction is expected to take place.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is generally simple enough, the illicit buys the diamond\r\nand pays for it, when the Kafir gives a signal, and the detectives rush\r\nin and seize the man who is pointed out as the purchaser. The “trap” is\r\nagain searched, when, as corroborative evidence, no diamond is found on\r\nhim, but in its place, the money he has just received in payment for the\r\n“stone.” Convictions, however, are occasionally obtained when no money\r\nhas passed, in which case, however, the evidence of the traps is\r\nrequired to be very strongly corroborated.\r\n\r\nBlack “traps” and white are employed by the detective department. The\r\nblack trap is generally a native who does the dirty work purely as a\r\nmatter of business, and is thoroughly honest; the white trap on the\r\ncontrary is generally one who has been in the illicit trade himself, and\r\neither from avarice or motives of jealousy and revenge sells some former\r\ncomrade to penal servitude and the breakwater.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1887, an instance occurred, showing that in spite of all the\r\nelaborate machinery of a rigid searching system, probably general if not\r\nuniversal, and the existence of the severe ordinance in question, etc.,\r\nthe native continues to steal diamonds. In a compound at Du Tot’s Pan,\r\nonly a few months ago, the body of a native who died suddenly under\r\nsuspicious circumstances was opened and a diamond of no less weight than\r\nsixty carats discovered therein.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for the extensive machinery and the enormous cost of the\r\nsearching and detective departments will to my mind be done away with if\r\nthe “compound system” inaugurated by the Central Co. in the Kimberley\r\nmine be carried out by other companies. In April, 1885, this company\r\nopened their buildings for native servants. I attended the opening\r\nceremony, and to my surprise found a large yard some 150 yards square\r\ninclosed partly by buildings and the remainder by sheets of iron ten\r\nfeet high. Within this inclosure were sleeping-rooms for 500 Kafirs, a\r\nmagnificent kitchen and pantry, large baths, guard-room, dispensary and\r\nsick-ward, store and mess-rooms. There is no doubt that this arrangement\r\nwill be the means of greatly decreasing the thieving by natives, but it\r\nopens up a great question connected with the business of the place, with\r\nrespect to the “truck” system which must follow, and has yet to be\r\nthreshed out.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteen years I have been on the Fields, I can\r\nconscientiously say, I have never known one single man found guilty who\r\ndid not well deserve his punishment, though I have known many escape\r\nthrough the laudable determination of the judges to require most\r\nincontrovertible evidence before convicting.\r\n\r\nI do not attempt for one moment to extenuate the crime or treat lightly\r\nthe social ulcer which so undermines the moral health of the community,\r\nbut I cannot help drawing attention, in connection with the subject of\r\nthis chapter, to the 450 carat diamond which has just flashed like a\r\nmeteor across the London market.\r\n\r\nThis is well known to have come from Jagersfontein. A whisper had never\r\nbeen heard of a diamond of such weight, such color and such brilliancy\r\nhaving been found there or in any other mine in the country, but a Port\r\nElizabeth house quietly shipped it, and it was bought in London for\r\n£20,000 by a syndicate composed of men knowing the diamond fields\r\nintimately.\r\n\r\nThe actuality of this diamond came prominently before the public in a\r\nsuit before the High Court of Griqualand West in October, 1886, in a\r\ncase wherein the chief of the detective department was called to give\r\nevidence. During the course of this gentleman’s examination one of the\r\njudges said: “Do you know where that very large diamond produced in\r\nLondon some time ago came from?” “I do; from information received I\r\ncould give your lordship the whole history of that stone from the time\r\nit left the ground until it reached Messrs. —— Bros.” This led to\r\nanother question by one of the other two judges comprising the bench,\r\nwhich clinched the matter: “Was it a Griqualand West stone?” “No, it was\r\nnot, my lord.”\r\n\r\nThese, perhaps, like the Pharisee, “thank God, that they are not as\r\nother men are.” But the question I would ask is this syndicate not the\r\nbuyer, second hand, of stolen property?\r\n\r\n                       “Conscentia mille testes.”\r\n\r\nEven in England the crime of receiving stolen goods is heavily\r\npunishable, but in a case like this the worthies know well that it can\r\nnever be brought home to them.\r\n\r\nThe charge has frequently been brought against the diggers that they had\r\nvery considerably themselves to thank for the extent to which I. D. B.\r\nhad spread. Had they taken proper precautions, it was urged, thefts\r\nwould have minimized, and it was further pointed out, that though it\r\nmight be true that if there were no receivers there would be no thieves,\r\nit is obviously true that if there were no thieves there could be no\r\nreceivers. I cannot myself entirely acquit the diggers of the charge of\r\nculpable negligence. On the other hand, within the past three or four\r\nyears there has been less ground for the accusation, as an elaborate\r\nsearching system has been introduced. All the employés of the companies\r\nor individual diggers, white men under the rank of manager and colored\r\nmen universally, are liable to be searched at any time. The white\r\noverseer even does not know when this may take place, as the order is\r\nsecretly given from headquarters whom to search.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the searching of white men I may mention a lamentable\r\noccurrence that took place in the early part of 1884. A fiat went forth\r\nthat they should be compelled to strip naked, and a natural feeling of\r\nindignation arose, as many of the overseers had been themselves pioneer\r\ndiggers, and the majority of miners were men of undoubted\r\nrespectability. A most regretable amount of ill-feeling arose between\r\nemployers and employés, and though I believe the former were willing to\r\nforego the condition that absolute nudity would be required, yet the\r\nproviso that the boots should be removed was distasteful to the latter.\r\nAt length a strike took place, to which, it is asserted, but with what\r\namount of truth I cannot say, the men were urged on by unscrupulous\r\noutsiders, who had their own ends to serve. The first strike was of\r\nbrief duration and passed over quietly, but the second, though also\r\nlasting a comparatively short time, was attended with fatal\r\nconsequences. Briefly the circumstances were as follows: A considerable\r\nnumber of men were proceeding to the edge of the Kimberley mine to\r\ncompel the French company to draw their fires. The men all distinctly\r\nassert they had no intention whatever of damaging the machinery or\r\nhauling gear of the company. A barricade had been erected by the\r\nservants of the company, behind which were armed policemen and certain\r\ndiggers, etc., who had been sworn in as special constables. Various\r\naccounts are given as to how the affray began, at all events, though the\r\npolice did not fire a single shot, the special constables shot dead on\r\nthe spot four of the unfortunate men, who were buried next day, and\r\nanother, who was an old patient of mine, died an hour or so after in my\r\nconsulting-room, where he and a comrade who died a week after had been\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nGreat fears were entertained of a general riot; the canteens were\r\nordered to be closed, the men who had fired the fatal shots were removed\r\nfor safety to the jail, the government removed all firearms from the\r\ngun-stores, a corps of mounted specials was organized, while all save\r\nthose whose passions were inflamed on one side or the other deeply\r\ndeplored the sad events, and looked forward with the gravest\r\napprehension to what a day or night might bring forth. The funerals of\r\nthe fallen men were most impressive, hundreds, indeed I might say\r\nthousands, attending them, following most on foot, in slow procession to\r\nthe solemn strains of the “Dead March in Saul.” Happily, however, there\r\nwas no further bloodshed, and before a fortnight or three weeks were\r\nover, with but few exceptions, the men had returned to work and an\r\namicable conclusion arrived at.\r\n\r\nTo proceed to the searching of natives, though there are certain\r\ndifferences in different mines, generally speaking the system is as\r\nfollows: On arriving at the searching house they are compelled to divest\r\nthemselves of their ordinary garb and pass through a central compartment\r\nin _puris naturalibus_, after which they assume working suits, needless\r\nto say absolutely pocketless. Their work over, they are first searched\r\nin the claims by the overseers and then are examined by the searching\r\nofficers. They are stripped perfectly naked and compelled to leap over\r\nbars, and their hair, mouths, ears, etc., etc., carefully examined—no\r\nparticularly pleasant duty for the searcher when the thermometer stands\r\nat perhaps 100° Fahrenheit in the shade.[46] There are grave doubts\r\noccasionally expressed as to the efficacy of this costly system, as\r\ncomparatively few diamonds have ever been found in the searching houses,\r\nand the thievish native exercises an almost supernatural ingenuity in\r\nconcealing his plunder, but the question is what diamonds have been\r\nprevented from being stolen rather than what stolen diamonds have been\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAnother system in which the supporters express a firm belief is that\r\nknown as the compound system, which is shortly as follows. I have\r\nalready described the Central Co.’s compound, but I will go a little\r\nmore into detail: A company’s boys, instead of being allowed to wander\r\nabout the town at their own sweet will, to feed at Kafir eating-houses\r\n(which are too frequently the favorite resorts of black I. D. B.\r\nrunners, and whose proprietors are not invariably above reproach) and to\r\ndrink at low canteens or smuggling dens, are confined to a company’s\r\ncompound for two months, the period for which they now contract.\r\n\r\nThey are comfortably housed, and being unable to obtain the deleterious\r\nand adulterated liquor which has proved so many a native’s poison and\r\ndeath, are in the main much healthier than their uncompounded brethren,\r\nwho spending two-thirds of their wages in drink on Saturday and Sunday\r\nare almost inanimate the following day and unable to work. It is\r\nneedless to say that this system has aroused considerable opposition\r\nfrom the Kafir store-keepers, canteen-keepers and others whose\r\npurchasers are mainly natives, together with, it goes without saying,\r\nthe I. D. B. gentry and a few who are neither I. D. B.’s, Kafir\r\nstore-keepers nor the like, but who conceive that the system will tend\r\nto ruin the commerce of the town.[47] It is urged that the principle of\r\n“live and _let_ live” was never more flagrantly outraged; that the bread\r\nis taken out of honest men’s mouths; that it is not by Kafirs, not even\r\nmainly by Kafirs, that diamonds are taken from the mines, and that it is\r\na direct interference with the liberty of the subject. The last reason,\r\nhowever, is not a very cogent one against the subject, as the native\r\nagrees of his own accord to the contract, and philanthropists declare\r\nthe compound to be an unmingled boon to the Kafir.\r\n\r\nThat it involves something allied to the “truck system” is apparently\r\nplain, as of course the necessities of life must be purchased in the\r\ncompound, though it must be remembered that the legislative enactments\r\nwhich forbid the system in England were introduced to protect the\r\nemployé whose wages were diminished by the unfair profits and the\r\nexorbitant interest charged by the “tommy shop,” _not_ to protect the\r\nshopkeeper whose business was interfered with. Again, the wages are paid\r\nin cash, and the company’s store can in the event of the native failing\r\nto pay up at the end of the week merely, as I surmise, recover it by\r\nordinary civil process. The companies disclaim all intention of making\r\nany profits for their shareholders by their shops in the compound, and\r\nare prepared to accept outside price-lists and distribute the profits\r\namong such institutions as the free hospital and the public library.\r\n\r\nThat those who have sunk their money, large or small, in the erection of\r\nKafir stores and native bars feel the system a grievance I can readily\r\nunderstand, and for my part, on the principle of self-preservation being\r\nthe first law of nature, am not disposed to blame them very much, if at\r\nall, for endeavoring to protect their interests by getting a bill\r\nintroduced into parliament to abolish not the compound system, but to\r\nrender it almost null and void by limiting the period during which the\r\nKafirs can be kept in the compounds, through a clause principally to the\r\neffect that no goods can be vended there. A bill was introduced into the\r\nCape parliament last year with this object, but a compromise, which is\r\nperhaps only temporary, was effected, and the bill withdrawn.\r\n\r\nMost probably the matter will be brought before the house again next\r\nsession, but I scarcely think it has much chance of passing; meanwhile\r\nthe mining union has undertaken not to compound any white men, and to\r\nlimit the period during which they keep the native compounded to two\r\nmonths only.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter I shall take the opportunity of expressing my\r\nown views on the progressive legislation by which the late legislative\r\ncouncil of Griqualand West and the Cape assembly since annexation have\r\nattempted to cope with this crime. After a long and thorough\r\nacquaintance with all classes of this community (for which, to a certain\r\nextent, I have to thank my profession), I have come to the conclusion\r\nthat the punishments now inflicted are not adapted to the requirements\r\nof the case. The present judicial procedure of sentencing this class of\r\nprisoner to a long term of hard labor, during which its members learn\r\nadvanced lessons in crime, and then turning them loose, further\r\naccomplished, upon the unfortunate digger, is to my mind not only a tax\r\non the country, but also a calamity to Griqualand West. In my opinion a\r\nshorter period of imprisonment would suffice, but to this I would add a\r\nsequestration of all the culprit’s movable and immovable property, and\r\nbanishment from the colony for at least twenty years, under pain of say\r\nfifteen years’ imprisonment with hard labor should he return previously.\r\nCriminals of this class, again, are tempted by the extra chances of\r\nsudden fortune which it presents.\r\n\r\nCases in which second convictions have taken place are numerous, in fact\r\nthere seems to be a peculiar fascination which irresistibly attracts its\r\ndevotees, and seems to render the majority of them almost incorrigible;\r\nconsequently one of the best methods of protecting the mining community\r\nagainst these vampires is that they should be entirely beyond the reach\r\nof a species of temptation that they are unable to withstand.\r\n\r\nThere is one point, in addition, which I must not omit to mention in\r\nclosing this chapter, and that is the readiness with which the present\r\nministry (1885–86–87) recommend the governor of the colony to grant\r\npardons to I. D. B.’s. “Petition-mongering, too, is a highly respectable\r\nbusiness, for legislators of the land condescend to handle and flutter\r\nthe interesting documents in the faces of sympathizers; cabinet\r\nministers are not averse to joining in the game, and the stamp of the\r\nvery highest authority is secured for it when his excellency the\r\ngovernor is persuaded into opening the doors of the jail and bidding the\r\nexultant illicit go forth once more, to lay his roguish hands on the\r\nhard-earned gains of the diamond digger.”\r\n\r\nI have known cases of the most extraordinary character, one I will\r\nmention in particular. On the prisoner’s first conviction, he received a\r\nsentence of five years’ imprisonment, but was liberated after fifteen\r\nmonths’ incarceration, when, at once resuming the same sneaking kind of\r\ntheft, he was caught again, and seven years awarded to him to ponder\r\nover his outrages. _Mirabile dictu!_ thirteen months saw him, through\r\nhis excellency the governor’s kindness, a free man once more; but with\r\nwell-earned experience, as he now, the third time of asking, makes Free\r\nTown, in the adjoining republic, not Kimberley, the safe base of his\r\ndishonest operations. The hammer which shivered this man’s links must\r\nhave been heavily weighted indeed! As he told me, one hammer, which of\r\nitself was not heavy enough to complete the work, weighed £850.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n  DESCRIPTION OF THE I. D. B.—PUBLIC MORALS.—THE MUSIC HALLS AND THEIR\r\nSONGS.—“M. L. A.’S AND M. L. C.’S IN LEAGUE WITH THIEVES AND RECEIVERS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIllicit diamond buyers are like the devils recorded in the gospel, whose\r\nname was “legion, for they were many.” The illicits are not only many in\r\nnumber, but also many in species.\r\n\r\nThe genus has little changed from the earlier times, for the I. D. B.\r\nwas and is simply a receiver of stolen goods, well knowing them to be\r\nstolen, nothing more and nothing less. But the species of this genus are\r\nso numerous that their accurate categorist would almost rival a Linnæus\r\nor a Cuvier.\r\n\r\nSome of the species are as extinct as the dodo; others have changed as\r\nremarkably as diseases, which once epidemic have become endemic, and\r\nmembers of the latter class, might, if classically inclined,\r\nappropriately quote, with reference to their altered position: “Tempora\r\nmutantur, et nos mutamur in illis.”\r\n\r\nThe I. D. B. of 1872 was not the I. D. B. of to-day; the I. D. B., whose\r\ncanvas canteen, thronged by semi-nude Shangaans, Zulus, Basutos or\r\nBallapins, was occasionally burnt over his head, was a different person\r\nin his _modus operandi_ and manner of living from the “speculator” of\r\n1885.\r\n\r\nThe “kopje walloper,” who was generally a gentleman of the Hebrew\r\npersuasion hailing from Petticoat Lane or the Minories, was one of those\r\nwho, when diamond buying was as legal in the open air as in a properly\r\nregistered office, used to haunt the edge of the mine. With satchel at\r\nside, well lined with gold and notes, sometimes on the chance of buying\r\na diamond cheaply, trading on the ignorance of the finder, but generally\r\nwith the view of tempting sorters to steal from the sorting table, he is\r\nnow almost forgotten, although his moral counterpart exists to this day\r\nin the scoundrel who tempts, and but too often successfully, the white\r\nservants of a company or a claim-holder to become thieves, or to\r\nconveniently wink at the thieving of others.\r\n\r\nThe I. D. B. digger who could turn out as many diamonds in an\r\nafternoon’s wash-up as mealies on a cob, and by a marvelous dispensation\r\nof Providence was always hitting upon “splendid ground” in his claim, is\r\nnow a _rara avis_, for the _onus probandi_ of _bona fide_ possession\r\nbeing now thrown upon the holders of rough and uncut diamonds, the\r\ndigger who discovers priceless gems in notoriously worthless ground and\r\nby the aid of the poorest appliances runs a serious risk of being\r\nconfronted with the judge of the special court.[48] To those\r\nunacquainted with diamond digging the awarding of a punishment for what\r\nmight, at first sight, appear to be merely exceptional “luck” may seem\r\nmore than Draconian, but this point will be referred to in a succeeding\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nThe bogus licensed diamond buyer too who, frequently subsidised by some\r\nhidden man, merely pretended to transact legitimate business as a cloak\r\nfor his illicit transactions, but did all that remunerated him in the\r\n“dead waist and middle of the night” is rapidly becoming extinct, owing\r\nto the stringent rules as to the proof of _bona fide_ possession and the\r\nenforced registration of sale and purchase, though at the same time he\r\nis still extant in this year of grace, 1887. Like the cat employed by\r\nthe ingenious monkey, however, in removing chestnuts from the fire, or\r\nthe policeman in Gilbert’s opera, “his life is not a happy one.”\r\n\r\nAgain, the native claim-holder and digger who either bought a claim or\r\nwas put into one to find diamonds, which, as a matter of fact, came from\r\nsome other claim, perhaps some other mine, or even the river digging,\r\nnow finds a more congenial occupation in running parcels over the Free\r\nState line or to Christiana in the Transvaal, or acting as an unlicensed\r\ndiamond broker within the limits of the camp. “Jonas” and “Kleinboy” may\r\nstill be seen with rings on their fingers and attired in a “masher”\r\nstyle which would not disgrace a West End tailor, but they are no longer\r\ndiggers, though apparently their present occupation pays them handsomely\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nBefore the act of 1882 came into force Kimberley was a different place\r\nfrom what it is now—a nervous activity was universal. The booted and\r\nspurred I. D. B. could then be seen galloping on his well-groomed steed\r\nto his favorite resort, the canteen bars were thronged day and night,\r\nthe billiard-rooms were crowded. The “Free and Easy,” too, had its\r\nfrequenters, who were posted in all the comic songs of the day, and\r\nnightly twitted and tickled each other with the chorus of one at that\r\ntime just out from home. These gentlemen evidently appropriated and\r\nappreciated the point of its refrain, singing with great gusto.\r\n\r\n                    “They all do it, they all do it,\r\n                    Though they very often rue it,”\r\n\r\nas if their vile traffic and its consequences were one huge grim\r\njoke.[49]\r\n\r\nAt another music hall the song most in favor and nightly sung with\r\nimmense _éclat_ was one in which the adventures of a fortunate I. D. B.\r\nwere told in the following doggerel, which was always sure of a\r\nvociferous encore, especially as many thought it had a peculiar local\r\napplication:\r\n\r\n           “I’m shortly about to retire,\r\n           Then to Flo of course I’ll be wed,\r\n           I shall do the thing fine, buy shares in the mine\r\n           Or else float a company instead.\r\n           I’ll of course have a carriage and pair,\r\n           And later I shall not despair,\r\n           In the council I’ll get, and if _you_ wait a bit\r\n           No doubt you will see me made mayor.”\r\n\r\nThe fact of a song like this being sung in public speaks volumes as to\r\nthe utter demoralization which then existed in certain circles.\r\n\r\nIn their well-known houses of call the popping of champagne corks was\r\nlike one continuous fusilade, and money flowed like water, for at this\r\ntime the illicit buyer had little or no fear of a detective tapping him\r\non the shoulder and asking him to account for the diamonds in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nProfessor Darwin may write about the development of species, but if he\r\nresided here he might describe how an eminently respectable (?) member\r\nof society is evolved from a thief. There are I. D. B.’s and I. D. B.’s,\r\nall grades from high to low, from rich to poor, some accounted among the\r\n_creme de la creme_ of Kimberley society, even pillars of this or that\r\nchurch, pious receivers and ex-receivers of stolen property well knowing\r\nit to be stolen, others buying from hand to mouth to ward off\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nThe I. D. B. moving in society, probably now the manager of a digging\r\ncompany, or a licensed buyer, but nevertheless a rank hypocrite who has\r\nworked his way through all grades of rascality to a certain position,\r\nwishes by associating with men of acknowledged social status to avoid\r\nsuspicion, and therefore, as a matter of tact, he rails against the\r\nillicit trade and preaches morality _ad nauseam_.\r\n\r\nIf he has money or influence he is surrounded by satellites, who shine\r\nbut by a borrowed light, or to alter the simile, by dogs who support\r\ntheir miserable existence by licking up the “crumbs that fall from the\r\nrich man’s table.”\r\n\r\nSo powerful is the leaven of corruption engendered by this illicit\r\nsystem, that men, otherwise of undoubted probity, “kowtow” to the man\r\nwhom in their heart of hearts they know to be, to quote thieves’ Latin,\r\na simple “fence,” because they think that\r\n\r\n                      “Thrift may follow fawning.”\r\n\r\nFrom the passing of ordinance 48 of 1882 until the extension of that\r\nordinance to the entire colony in the session of 1885, Capetown and Port\r\nElizabeth were the head-centres of the I. D. B.’s, who, possessing\r\ncapital, wished to evade the consequence of their nefarious trade. These\r\nscoundrels bought diamonds which were stolen and smuggled from\r\nGriqualand West, and men, supposed to be honorable (?) merchants, even\r\nmembers of the legislative assembly, were reported as trading with these\r\ncharacters in diamonds which they must have known to be stolen.\r\n\r\nAn apparently legal, though in reality a dishonest trade, was carried on\r\nby these men, who were described by the editor of the Orange Free State\r\n_Advertiser_ as “M. L. A.’s and M. L. C.’s, in league with thieves and\r\nreceivers of stolen property.”\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Trade extension act has however been of infinite service in\r\nchecking the illicit traffic at the Bay and Capetown, though it has not\r\nentirely extinguished it.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, there does not exist anywhere a more unredeemable\r\nset of miscreants than the arch-thieves who are at the head of the\r\nillicit diamond trade in South Africa.\r\n\r\nIllicit diamond buying, like all crime the root of which is greed of\r\nmoney, tends to kill all humane instincts, and leaves those who practice\r\nit more selfish than the very brutes and absolutely dead to every better\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nThe flattering unction which the confederates of the I. D. B. fraternity\r\nlay to their souls, if any grain of conscience remains, is that they are\r\nmerely guilty of a revenue offense. It is therefore only to their\r\ncowardly fear of punishment that the law of the land must appeal if a\r\nstop is to be put to the wholesale system of robbery which they have\r\norganized and carried on so long with comparative impunity.\r\n\r\nThe I. D. B. now and then boasts in his cups that he has bought hand\r\nover fist, and cares nothing for, the adjective detective; but when the\r\naforesaid adjective detective lightly lays his hands on his shoulder, he\r\nusually manifests the craven cowardice of a Noah Claypole rather than\r\nthe bravery of a bold outlaw like Robin Hood, or the semi-chivalrous\r\naudacity and recklessness of a Claude Duval or a Dick Turpin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n                                I. D. B.\r\nTALES FROM REAL LIFE.—“THE MYSTIC THREE LETTERS.”—AN UNGRATEFUL HOUND.—A\r\n PLUCKY WOMAN.—NEMESIS.—TOO CLEVER BY HALF.—THE EARLY BIRD CATCHES THE\r\n            WORM.—AN UNEXPECTED RECOVERY.—A DEATH-BED SCENE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with this nefarious traffic, this insidious disease I will\r\nterm it, the nature of which I have, I hope, fully explained in a\r\npreceding chapter, I purpose appending a few examples, grave and gay, to\r\nillustrate the subject.\r\n\r\nThe stories are not without interest, illustrating as they do a certain\r\nphase of humanity, and at the same time possessing the merit of strict\r\naccuracy, as I have carefully excluded any narratives for the truth of\r\nwhich I am not, so far as is possible in such secret transactions,\r\npersonally able to vouch.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that some slight freemasonry, not to speak of a\r\nfrequent exhibition of what might fairly be termed freehanded\r\ngenerosity, undoubtedly exists or has existed among the fraternity of\r\nthe mystic three letters, it must not for one moment be imagined that\r\ntheir moral sense prevents them cheating each other quite as\r\nremorselessly as the unfortunate digger or shareholder, on whose vitals\r\nthey so long have “preyed” without ceasing. Men engaged in this traffic\r\nwill rob one another, and there is no honor whatever among thieves of\r\nthis class, their standard of morality being low indeed. Creatures of\r\nthis type will often descend to any depth to gratify their sensual\r\npleasure, and to satisfy their greed for gold. Examples have not been\r\ninfrequent on the diamond fields of men employing Kafir females, on the\r\none hand as touts for their infamous trade, and on the other to minister\r\nto the basest lusts of their nature. These unfortunate women are, as a\r\nrule, faithful to their protectors (Heaven save the mark!) combining at\r\nthe same time the capacities of mistress, drudge and go-between. Their\r\nlife is a terrible one, poor creatures, as this tale will show.\r\n\r\nA certain _gentleman_, who boasted of his intimate acquaintance with the\r\nmysteries of one of the gayest capitals in Europe, was living not so\r\nlong ago with a smart and not by any means repulsive-looking Fingo\r\nwoman. About this time camp fever was very prevalent, and he fell under\r\nits influence. For days, nay, weeks, the disease held him in its grasp,\r\nand as day and night he tossed in wild delirium, hiding himself in the\r\nbedclothes to escape from the imaginary detectives who were conjured up\r\nby his disordered brain, his bedside was but seldom deserted by this\r\nloving example of native fidelity.\r\n\r\nHis trade connection with the “boys” employed in the mine had, however,\r\nto be kept together, and here it was that the faithful creature showed\r\nthe devotion of her nature by running great risks in purchasing diamonds\r\nfrom the natives who had been in the habit of coming to her paramour.\r\nWhen this man rose from his bed of sickness, to his astonishment she\r\npresented him with hundreds of carats of valuable diamonds, but my\r\nreaders will scarcely credit it when I tell them that no sooner was this\r\ndespicable hound able to crawl than he sneaked away to Europe, taking\r\nwith him the diamonds that _she_ had bought, and leaving _her_ penniless\r\nto starve or gain her living on the streets.\r\n\r\n                   “Ingratum si dixeris omnia dices.”\r\n\r\nAs a pleasing contrast to the story I have just related, I have now to\r\nrecord an instance of woman’s fidelity and presence of mind when brought\r\nface to face with danger to those she loved.\r\n\r\nA man, his wife, and child resided in Newton, a quarter of the camp, at\r\none time at least, as thickly studded with swell I. D. B.’s “as the\r\nautumnal leaves that strew the brooks in Vallambrosa.”\r\n\r\nThe husband was, not without reason, suspected of being what was\r\neuphemistically known as “in the trade.” So the detectives came to his\r\nhouse again and yet again, they emptied the sugar pots, they stuck their\r\nfingers in the pomatum, the pepper-boxes were turned topsy-turvy, making\r\ncatarrh as universal in the house as cholera round Mecca; potatoes\r\npreparing for the diurnal tiffin were carefully diagnosed as to their\r\ndiamondiferous capabilities, in fact Newton, the philosopher, suffered\r\nless from the incendiary propensities of his lap-dog than did Newton,\r\nthe locality, from the “minions of the law.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion when these gentlemen put in an appearance, a diamond of\r\na large size was lying in the reticule of Mrs. —— upon the table. When\r\nabout to rise and remove it, she was ordered by the officers to remain\r\nseated, whereupon she asked permission to send for a bottle of stout, a\r\nrequest at once acceded to. Hastily scribbling the words “Send bottle\r\nstout; keep bag till I come,” she rose and nonchalantly handed the\r\nmessage and reticule containing the diamond to her child, who toddled\r\noff to a neighboring canteen, where, as the mother knew, her husband was\r\nalmost certain to be found. He, smelling a rat, made away with the\r\nstone, and the detectives very soon after left the house, baffled in\r\ntheir search, never dreaming of how they had been overreached. This\r\nwoman’s presence of mind no doubt saved her husband many years in jail.\r\n\r\nThough then notoriously “in the swim” they are now, having seen the\r\nerror of their ways, earning an honest livelihood down Colony, and I am\r\ntold often exhibit that “charity” which we are taught “covers a\r\nmultitude of sins.”\r\n\r\nIn the case I will now mention Nemesis overtakes well-nigh all parties\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nAbout August, 188—, an individual over whose head was hanging a charge,\r\nnot, however, connected with the diamond ordinance, determined to\r\ndiminish his household expenses by sending his wife to Europe in charge\r\nof the proceeds of certain little private speculations which, it is\r\nneedless for me to say, are never entered in the books of any mercantile\r\nfirm. After selling off, he took apartments for his wife and another\r\nlady at a somewhat pretentious looking hotel in Kimberley.\r\n\r\nAll was going merrily as marriage bells are popularly supposed to do,\r\nthe voyage was anticipated with eager delight, and a visit to an old\r\nfriend in Hatton Garden was expected to prove highly remunerative; but\r\n“l’homme propose et Dieu dispose.”\r\n\r\nThe detective department, from “information received,” determined to\r\nmake these ladies a domiciliary visit; so one afternoon, just as a nice\r\nlittle tiffin had been washed down with a glass of fine Clicquot,\r\nrendered still more delicious by the inspection of the glittering gems,\r\nwhich they had proudly been displaying to the longing eyes of the\r\nlandlady, who had come in to remove the cloth, a sharp tap was heard at\r\nthe door, and in walked the dreaded forms of two prominent detectives\r\nand a female searcher.\r\n\r\nQuick as lightning the landlady whisked up the cloth, diamonds and all,\r\nleaving the room to give the officers the opportunity of a private and\r\nconfidential interview with their startled guests. These gentlemen\r\nhaving explained the object of their visit politely introduced their\r\nfemale companion, and retired to smoke a cigar on the verandah.\r\n\r\nThe lady visitor, or rather the female searcher, at once took advantage\r\nof her position, and sarcastically remarked to her agitated “friends”:\r\n“Never mind, my dears, let down your hair; I have had finer ladies than\r\nyou through my fingers before.”\r\n\r\nAfter expressing satisfaction at the elegance of their coiffure, she\r\nthen proceeded to admire their entire wardrobe, even the pretty little\r\nNo. 2’s and silk stockings in which their tiny feet were encased did not\r\nescape attention.\r\n\r\nNot finding any portion of their apparel encrusted with gems of purest\r\nray, decidedly meant, in this case, to blush unseen, this “perfect lady”\r\nproceeded to express her appreciation of the delicate whiteness of their\r\narms, somewhat marring their beauty, however, by leaving marks of sundry\r\npinches which she inflicted to test the genuine nature of their\r\nplumpness.[50]\r\n\r\nThis interview being brought to a satisfactory or unsatisfactory\r\nconclusion, as the reader may elect to decide, the detectives and their\r\ncoadjutrix took their departure. Forthwith the ladies rang the bell for\r\nthe landlady, who promptly answered it, but wonderful to relate denied\r\nthe most remote knowledge of the contents of the table-cloth, averring\r\nthat when she shook it there was nothing but bread-crumbs to be seen.\r\n\r\nWhat could be done? These ladies dare not appeal to the police, time\r\npressed, their passages had been taken, so they were compelled to brave\r\nthe perils of the deep, unsupported by the pleasing hope that they had\r\ncherished of a profitable visit to the horticultural domains of Hatton\r\nGarden, E. C.\r\n\r\nNow would the reader be surprised to hear, that shortly after this\r\nincident, the husband of the landlady, whose eyesight had been so very\r\ndefective, was suddenly seized with a desire to visit the Transvaal,\r\npossibly to investigate the gold-bearing qualities of that State,\r\nperhaps merely for an agreeable change. He did not, however, confine his\r\nperegrinations to the suzerainty, but proceeded to make an amateur\r\nsurvey of the proposed railway route between Pretoria and Delagoa Bay\r\nover the Lebombo Mountains. From the latter place he set sail for\r\nRotterdam, which he reached in a much more satisfied frame of mind than\r\nhis whilom lady boarders possessed on their arrival in London.\r\n\r\nAs all the world knows diamond cutters are to be found in considerable\r\nnumbers in Holland, and it did not take him long to renew acquaintance\r\nwith his old friends, some of whom were skilled in that trade. To one of\r\nthese he intrusted the cutting of a valuable parcel of gems, which by an\r\nalmost inexplicable coincidence was the exact counterpart of that which\r\na few months before had disappeared so mysteriously at his antipodean\r\nhotel. Now, our Boniface was a gay old dog in his way, so he made up his\r\nmind to taste once more the long absent pleasures of the capitals of\r\nEurope, serenely conscious that a little extravagance was pardonable in\r\na landlord whose very table linen produced more diamonds in one shaking\r\nthan many a twelve-foot washing machine, worked by a Davy Paxman, would\r\nin thousands of revolutions. While enjoying the gayeties of Vienna, he\r\nreceived a telegram to the effect that his diamonds had been duly cut\r\nand were awaiting his disposal. So he at once returned to Holland,\r\nreceived his gems and secured the services of a well-known goldsmith for\r\ntheir setting, which proved in accordance with his orders both elaborate\r\nand costly. When all was completed he started once more for his South\r\nAfrican home. Many a night, ere the billows rocked him to sleep, though\r\ncongratulating himself on his lucky journey, he mentally execrated the\r\ntyranny of a government which he knew too well would on his arrival in\r\nCapetown heartlessly exact from him a certain duty of 30 per cent. _ad\r\nvalorem_. The thought of this unwarrantable interference with the\r\nliberty of the subject haunted him continually, until one night as his\r\ncabin companion told me he was disturbed by a delighted chuckle followed\r\nby a semi-audible soliloquy: “Shtrike me dead, I’ve got it, pay the dam\r\nduty, not if I knowsh it, sho’elp me. I’ll risk it.”\r\n\r\nArrived at Capetown he induced a female passenger with whom he was\r\nacquainted, to conceal about her person the diamonds which already had\r\nhad so strange a story, and thus endeavor to evade the eagle eyes of the\r\nrevenue officials stationed at the dock entrance.\r\n\r\nThe attempt was unsuccessful, the diamonds were discovered and\r\nconfiscated, and the fair contrabandista, having of course in\r\nself-defence revealed the owner, he was tried for the misdemeanor, when\r\nin addition to the loss of his jewelry he was sentenced to pay a heavy\r\nfine or in default of payment to endure a term of imprisonment.\r\n\r\nFor time he cared little, for character less, for money more,\r\nconsequently as a matter of course the Capetown jail received within its\r\nwalls a visitor who for several months had leisure to ruminate on the\r\nadage, “much will have more,” ofttimes more than it bargains for.\r\n\r\nThis same man on being liberated returned to the Fields, sunk lower and\r\nlower, until one day he was caught in “_flagrante delicto_” by the\r\ndetective department. The breakwater at Capetown now is visited daily by\r\nthe quondam tourist and the gradual progress of this valuable public\r\nwork is materially assisted by the thews and sinews of our ingenious but\r\nnot ingenuous hero.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the strange infatuation which this crime exercises\r\nover its votaries, how like the fascinated moth they flutter round the\r\ncandle, singeing their wings, and what perfidy they can on occasions\r\nexhibit to one another, I will give a brief anecdote respecting a young\r\nman whom we shall call Silberfeldt.\r\n\r\nUnder the old diamond ordinance this bright specimen of humanity was\r\ntrapped in the usual manner, caught red-handed by the detectives and\r\nsentenced to three years’ hard labor, of which time nearly two years\r\nwere remitted in consequence of good conduct while in jail. Unwarned by\r\nthis experience, ungrateful for the lenity shown him by the authorities,\r\nno sooner had he gained his liberty than he emulated the example of the\r\nscriptural sow and returned at once to his wallowing in the mire.\r\n\r\nThe further knowledge of the inner working of the I. D. B. craft, which\r\nhe had gained during his temporary retirement from public life, had so\r\nincreased his self-confidence that, considering himself now a veritable\r\npassed-master in its mysteries, he openly boasted there was not a man\r\nclever enough in all Griqualand West to catch him a second time; but\r\nunhappily for him, Ord 48, 1882, which throws upon the holders of\r\ndiamonds the _onus probandi_ of honest possession, had passed the Cape\r\nparliament, and had received Her Majesty’s sanction.\r\n\r\nToo wary to be trapped by even the most astute detective, he\r\nnevertheless, with all his cunning, fell into the meshes of the law, and\r\nalong with another was arrested under the section dealing with the\r\noffense of “illegal possession,” having been pounced upon one fine\r\nmorning, when diamonds were found in the house where he and his\r\ncompanion were stopping.\r\n\r\nThe two were friends who had long been on terms of the greatest\r\nintimacy, and naturally they might have been expected to stick to each\r\nother through thick and through thin. When, however, they were placed in\r\nthe dock and asked to plead, Silberfeldt at once, arrant coward as he\r\nwas, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Oh! your vorship, I don’t vant to plead, I’m going to turn Queensh\r\nevidensh.”\r\n\r\nThis vision of a traitor’s liberty, this desire to shelter himself and\r\nprotect his own worthless skin by “rounding on his pal” was soon rudely\r\nended by the magistrate, who intimated that the Crown was not in want of\r\nany “Queensh evidensh” in the case at all, or to slightly parody Oliver\r\nGoldsmith—\r\n\r\n                   “When the culprit cried, oh, yes!\r\n                   The court it cried, oh, no!”\r\n\r\nAfter evidence of a most conclusive character had been given, the\r\naccused were duly committed for trial to the special court, where,\r\nstrange to say, “one was taken and the other left,” with a cruel irony\r\nof fate, the one taken (to the breakwater for seven years) was the\r\nperfidious Silberfeldt, the one left (to the enjoyment of his liberty)\r\nwas the friend who so narrowly escaped betrayal.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the fact that in temporal matters at least “honesty”\r\ndoes not always appear to be “the best policy,” I recollect an instance\r\nof which the truth can be vouched.\r\n\r\nOne fine spring morning in September, 187–, a certain diamond buyer,\r\nwhom we will call Gonivavitski, might have been seen marching up and\r\ndown the Bulfontein road enjoying the early rays of the sun, reading the\r\ndaily paper, yet still keeping a narrow watch on the canvas frame-house\r\nin which he conducted his licensed (?) dealings. Active, robust, cheery,\r\nthough a rogue in spirit and grain, manliness appeared to beam from\r\nevery line of his seemingly honest face. Our friend, too, was of a\r\ndogmatic turn of mind, insisted on “cleanliness being next to\r\ngodliness,” and no firmer believer in the proverb that the “early bird\r\ncatches the worm” could have been found in all Kimberley.\r\n\r\nJust as he had finished the leading article he caught sight of one of\r\nhis clients approaching in an opposite direction. G. started nervously,\r\nas he did not desire the visit of this especial gentleman in the\r\ndaylight—in other words he only bought of “niggers” after dark—but his\r\ndusky acquaintance gave him a sly glance, as much as to say: “I fancy\r\nI’ve seen you before,” a quite sufficient hint that “something” (as\r\nillicit stones are often called “in the trade”) was in the immediate\r\nneighborhood, so G. could not resist the temptation.\r\n\r\nTaking a bird’s-eye view of the situation, Gonivavitski hastily came up\r\nto the native, who, with a knowing leer, opened his hand, revealing a\r\nmagnificent pure white diamond nearly the size of a plover’s egg.\r\n\r\n“Mooi klippe baas!” (fine stone, master) said the nigger.\r\n\r\n“Ya! kom hier sa, booi,” (yes, come this way, boy) said G. hurriedly,\r\nfearing observation.\r\n\r\nThe boy did as he was told, following the white man into his office,\r\nwhich was close by. The door was soon shut, the stone weighed and the\r\nbargain struck, the native starting off with the money at a round trot\r\nto join his “brothers,” who were waiting round the corner. But\r\n“conscience doth make cowards of us all,” and Mr. G. was not an\r\nexception; fearing that he had been watched, and regardful either of his\r\nspotless reputation, or of the pleasures of the “tronk”[51] looming in\r\nthe future, started in hot pursuit and gave his late visitor into the\r\ncustody of the first policeman he met.\r\n\r\n“What’s up now?” said the guardian of law and order.\r\n\r\n“Why, look here, this d—d thief of a nigger wants to sell me this ’ere,”\r\nwas Gonivavitski’s answer, given in tones of simulated indignation.\r\n\r\n“This ’ere,” however, was not the forty-carat white diamond of a few\r\nminutes before, G. was too clever for that, it was merely a piece of\r\nboart not worth a sovereign that he now produced.\r\n\r\nA crowd soon gathered to watch the thief marched off to jail, the\r\n_honest_ man following in his wake to lay the charge. Next day at the\r\ntrial, a little perjury more or less was immaterial, the boy was\r\nsentenced to imprisonment and lashes, whilst Mr. G. in a few days found\r\nit necessary for the sake of his health to proceed to Europe, where he\r\ndisposed of the diamond for a good round sum. With this addition to his\r\nformer capital he returned to the Fields, where he still remains,\r\nboasting the possession of an ample fortune, gained, as he always says,\r\nby “’ard work and hearly rising.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most generally admitted apothegms of worldly wisdom is that\r\n“a man should always tell the truth to his doctor and his lawyer,” but\r\nlike many far more valuable maxims it is frequently disregarded. An\r\ninstance in which (albeit I am happy to say I have a tolerably good\r\nopinion of my fellow creatures) I could not place confidence in the\r\nstatements of my patient, occurs to my mind in connection with the\r\nanecdotes of which this chapter is composed.\r\n\r\nAbout two o’clock one morning in the year 1872 I was roused from the\r\nsleep I so much needed, as it was a sickly and busy season, by a hurried\r\nrapping at my front door. A doctor’s slumbers are through force of habit\r\nlight, and in a few seconds my dressing-gown and slippers were assumed,\r\nand I hastened to answer the imperative summons of my visitor. A\r\nmiddle-aged citizen, whose reputation, although never openly impugned,\r\nwas yet hardly enviable, greeted me in somewhat quavering accents, and\r\nwith pallid cheeks desired my services without a moment’s delay. Having\r\nushered him into my consulting-room I at once discovered the secret of\r\nhis alarm. The sufferer informed me that “he had been discussing with\r\nsome friends the means by which the rascally illicits evaded the law and\r\nconcealed their ill-gotten gems on any sudden emergency, suiting the\r\naction to the word he had swallowed (or otherwise concealed from view)\r\ntwo sovs. and a diamond.”\r\n\r\nI listened to the story with all becoming gravity, and proceeded to\r\nperform a surgical operation for the removal of the foreign substances,\r\nwith the anatomical details of which it is wholly unnecessary to weary\r\nmy readers. When relieved from his distress of mind and body he was\r\ndesirous of further explaining the circumstances under which the sad\r\noccurrence took place, but as the subject did not particularly interest\r\nme I suggested that “time was on the wing,” which hint he promptly took,\r\ndividing the _corpora delicti_ by leaving the gold with me and putting\r\nthe diamond (a thirty-carat stone) in his pocket. Years afterward, when\r\nI heard that while sitting among the _Dii majores_ of the Kimberley club\r\nthis gentleman’s main topic of conversation was his extreme horror of\r\nthe illicit traffic with its train of evils—I could not help calling to\r\nmind the episode of 1872. However, as we are told “the reformed rake\r\nmakes the best husband,” I hope that my ex-patient believes all he now\r\nenunciates, and what is still more important has the courage of his\r\nopinions.\r\n\r\nI shall finish these few sketches of I. D. B. with the recital of an\r\nincident which occurred to me personally: the moral to be gathered I\r\nleave to my readers.\r\n\r\nAs nearly as I can remember, it was late on a cold winter’s night in\r\nJune, 187–, that I heard a tapping at my bedroom window. It was a\r\ndreadful night. The south wind was blowing the sand from the débris\r\nheaps in fitful gusts, whilst the dust clouds were careering along so\r\nthickly that to see but a yard or two ahead was impossible. To those who\r\nknow the mine and its surroundings it will require but a slight stretch\r\nof imagination to picture the bottomless pit from which “all hell had\r\nbroken loose.”\r\n\r\nMentally anathematizing my nocturnal visitor, I rose and opened the\r\ndoor, when a Kafir thrust into my hand a piece of paper on which was\r\nscrawled in pencil:\r\n\r\n                                                 “DRY DIGGINGS HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n  “DR. MATTHEWS. _Sir_:—Mr. O. J. is tossing about and very restless\r\n  to-night, and says he _must_ see you. Will you come quickly—I think he\r\n  is dying?\r\n\r\n                            “Yours obediently,\r\n\r\n                                                                  I. P.”\r\n\r\nThough at the time one of the surgeons of the Dry Diggings hospital, yet\r\nas O. J. was not under my treatment I did not much relish the idea of a\r\ndreary walk at that time of night. Not wishing, however, to disappoint\r\nthe poor fellow, who had once worked a claim for me and who was now, so\r\nI had heard, dead out of luck, having, as the American gold digger says,\r\nstruck “the bed-rock,” I dressed quickly and trudged away through the\r\nheavy sand to the wattle and daub shanty which then did service as a\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival the attendant guided me with his flickering candle down\r\nthe long barn-like shed to the bedside of O. J. At a glance I saw that\r\ndeath had marked him for his own. Beads of cold sweat stood out on his\r\nforehead, whilst clammy hands and convulsive paroxysms of his throat\r\nshowed the nearness of the end.\r\n\r\n“Sie können Deutsch verstehen nicht wahr, Herr Doctor?” (You can\r\nunderstand German, can’t you, Doctor?)\r\n\r\nI nodded assent, when continuing the conversation partly in that\r\nlanguage and partly in English, evidently with the object of keeping the\r\nattendant ignorant of what was passing between us, he imploringly looked\r\nup and said: “Do tell me doctor how long I shall live, I can’t last\r\nlong.” I shook my head doubtfully, when he gasped out in tones of\r\nagonized anxiety:\r\n\r\n“I shan’t, I won’t, I can’t die without telling you how when I worked\r\nyour and Mr. Lynch’s claim in No. 6 I robbed you of nearly all your\r\ndiamonds! Oh! doctor, how I have hoped, how I have prayed God to let me\r\nlive, to spare me to work again, to make up the wrong that I have done\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nEntering further into details of how he had been tempted, and how he\r\nhoped, even if he never could work again, to repay me out of a\r\nremittance he expected from Europe, he suddenly seized my hand and in\r\nfeeble accents, broken by the death-rattle in his throat, uttered these\r\nearnest words:\r\n\r\n                “YOU WILL FORGIVE ME THOUGH, WON’T YOU?”\r\n\r\nComforting him as well as I could, I assured him that, as far as I was\r\nconcerned, he might bury the past in oblivion. Never shall I forget, to\r\nmy dying day, the expression of intense relief which passed over his\r\nanxious face and the glow which came again to his pallid cheek by the\r\nassurance which I gave him.\r\n\r\nAs I was rising to bid him good night he again grasped my hand with both\r\nof his and piteously exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Don’t, don’t forget me, doctor, you’ll come, won’t you, and see me\r\nto-morrow?”\r\n\r\nThis I promised him, although with inward misgiving that his “to-morrow”\r\nwould never come.\r\n\r\nInstructing the attendant to pay special heed to the sufferer during the\r\nnight, and again promising to return at sunrise, I trudged my weary way\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nDaylight saw me again at the hospital. Alas! Too late! No. 3 bed was\r\nempty! The troubled spirit had fled, its sins, I trust, blotted out for\r\never by a merciful and all-wise God!\r\n\r\nYet the wretch who tempted this poor fellow to steal diamonds, the\r\nsneaking creature who made him a thief and who profited by his thefts, I\r\nofttimes meet strutting proudly about with an air of pharisaical\r\nhonesty, to all outward appearance respectable and respected!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n   DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY AND SHARE MANIA IN 1881.—EVENTS OF THE\r\n“BUBBLE YEAR.”—CAUSES WHICH BROUGHT THE MANIA ABOUT.—WHY COMPANIES WERE\r\n FIRST FORMED.—THE BARNATO CO.—THE CENTRAL CO.—THE FRANKFORT MINE.—THE\r\n   COSMOPOLITAN CO.—WONDERFUL INVESTMENTS.—SLOW RETURN OF CONFIDENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “ten claim clause,” which was passed by the legislative council of\r\nGriqualand West under Governor Southey (_vide_ clause 18, Ordinance 10,\r\n1874), and prohibited any person, firm or joint-stock company to have\r\nregistered in his name, or in the name of his or their accredited agent\r\nat any time within six months, reckoned from the date of the\r\nproclamation of a digging, more than one claim, and after that period\r\nmore than ten claims, was brought forward by some interested men as the\r\nreason for the non-introduction of foreign capital into our digging\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe rescinding of this clause in 1876 (Ordinance 12, Nov. 20th) effected\r\ngreat changes, the alteration in the law throwing the road open for\r\ncapitalists to buy out small holders in the Kimberley and other mines,\r\nvirtually leading the way to the extraordinary mania for\r\ncompany-mongering and share-rigging which existed in 1880 and 1881.\r\n\r\nThe repeal of this clause, however, which had never been in favor with\r\ncapitalists, because it obstructed them from “blocking” claims in the\r\nmines, was hailed by some with delight, by others with foreboding, as\r\nthe latter believed it to prognosticate the approach of monopoly and the\r\ndeparture of the individual digger. This repeal initiated a most\r\nremarkable period in the history of the diamond fields, in which a mania\r\nfor company promoting and for mad speculation seized the whole\r\ncommunity, of which a repetition is now going on at the De Kaap gold\r\nfields. It may not perhaps be a matter of surprise that the inhabitants\r\nof a place, depending on a somewhat precarious industry and one of which\r\nthe proceeds are so liable to fluctuation, should be more or less imbued\r\nwith the spirit of gambling, nor is there anything unusual in the digger\r\ndeserting his mining operations to endeavor to gain wealth in a more\r\nrapid manner by speculation. Such circumstances have been of frequent\r\noccurrence in America and Australia, where many a man who had been\r\nunlucky as a digger, using his acquired knowledge has realized a fortune\r\nby speculating in shares or claims.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the sudden rise of the share mania in Kimberley, the most\r\nextraordinary point was to be found in the fact that the place had long\r\nthrown off the habits and appearance of a digging camp, and had assumed\r\nthe customs of a settled town, while all matters connected with share\r\ntransactions were conducted in so systematic a manner that the event\r\nbore a close resemblance to one of those speculative fevers which\r\noccasionally seize the home Stock Exchange. Kimberley was not alone in\r\nthis novel excitement; the infection spread throughout the whole of\r\nSouth Africa, share transactions were eagerly carried on in all the\r\ncoast towns, and companies with large capitals were also formed to work\r\nthe diamond mines in the Free State, at Jagersfontein, Koffyfontein and\r\nOliphansfontein, and half a dozen others of which it can now only be\r\nsaid\r\n\r\n                       “Gaudet cognomine terra.”\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter to fully trace why the cause of this wild desire\r\nfor speculation seized upon the community. It has often been stated that\r\nit was simply an endeavor on the part of interested persons on the\r\ndiamond fields to defraud the outside public and get rid of their\r\nworthless property. This, however, was not the case, although it must be\r\nadmitted that in many instances the actions of promoters of companies\r\nwere far from honorable. A more feasible answer to the question will be\r\nfound in the fact that for some time past there had existed in\r\nKimberley, companies which, although registered under the limited\r\nliability act, were of a semi-private nature; for instance, the\r\n“Compagnie Française” (French Diamond Mining Company) and the Cape\r\nDiamond Mining Company, both of which had been formed in 1879, some\r\nthree years after the “ten claim clause” had been abolished. These\r\nundertakings were believed to be most successful, and the general public\r\non the Fields were eager to participate in the profits of similar\r\nenterprises. When this desire became apparent there were many\r\nclaim-holders who were desirous of realizing some ready money, or paying\r\noff some existing mortgage, by the sale of a share in their diamond\r\noperations, and hence the creation of new joint-stock undertakings.\r\n\r\nThat the first companies on the Fields, the British and Central, were\r\nformed with a most legitimate object, it is quite impossible to deny,\r\nand the reason for their formation is most easily to be seen. As the\r\nmine attained a greater depth, the expenses of working naturally became\r\nlarger; elaborate machinery had to be erected, and more European labor\r\nwas therefore required. Under such circumstances it is not strange that\r\nmany diggers found it to their advantage to amalgamate with their\r\nneighbors; moreover, it often occurred that those who formerly had been\r\nactively employed in the mine were desirous of entering into other\r\npursuits, and yet were not willing to abandon all interest in digging\r\noperations; consequently the formation of joint-stock companies\r\nnaturally suggested itself as a convenient way of meeting the\r\nrequirements of the case. It was under such circumstances that the first\r\ncompanies in Kimberley were formed. The shares in these undertakings\r\nvery seldom passed out of the hands of the original holders and the\r\nsystem gave every promise of success; it is true that there were\r\nprophets of evil, who were ready even in those days to declare that this\r\nstep was one on the road to ruin, so far as the prosperity of Kimberley\r\nwas concerned, yet for a time the results of these companies in most\r\ncases proved to be unmistakably satisfactory, and it was this _bona\r\nfide_ success which encouraged the promotion of numerous other schemes\r\nwhich were shortly afterward introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1881 there existed about a dozen companies\r\nin the Kimberley mine, the total capital of which amounted roundly to\r\ntwo millions and a half, and the shares in these undertakings were in\r\nthe hands of the most successful diggers on the Fields. These shares had\r\nnot, of course, been purchased with cash, but every claim-holder who put\r\nhis claim ground into a company received a certain amount of scrip for\r\nhis property. It is impossible to dispute the fact that claim property\r\nhad risen enormously in value during the few years previous to the\r\nestablishment of the first joint-stock undertaking, and it is manifest\r\nthat if claims were incorporated in a company at a price on which they\r\ncould yield a fair dividend, that price was a perfectly fair one. The\r\nnon-success of many of the subsequent undertakings was mainly due to the\r\nfact that the promoters were blind to this very simple truth, and had\r\nforgotten, or had never known, the first principles which should govern\r\njoint-stock undertakings. In fact people who would never have dreamed of\r\nbuying a share in a business at £1,000, which would only secure a return\r\non five hundred, invested freely in shares in companies, the claims in\r\nwhich would have given an admirable return on a small capital, but a\r\nvery poor one, if any at all, on the enormous sums at which they were\r\nput in.\r\n\r\nWhen once the idea that the joint-stock system was the most advantageous\r\nmethod for working the mines gained a hold upon the community, the\r\nexcitement became intense, company after company was formed, and the\r\nshares in every case were eagerly taken up by the public. When the\r\nformation of a new undertaking was announced, the applications\r\nuniversally doubled and trebled the number of shares proposed to be\r\nallotted, and in fact a premium was invariably offered to a successful\r\napplicant for the chance he had secured of obtaining a share in any new\r\nventure.\r\n\r\nThe different lists for share applications were filled with marvelous\r\nrapidity, and remained open but a very short time. Ebden Street, the\r\n“Rue Quincampoix”[52] of Kimberley, was filled from morning to night\r\nwith a tumultuous and maddened crowd. The various offices of companies\r\nin formation were simply stormed, and those who could not get in at the\r\ndoor from the pressure of the crowd, threw their applications for shares\r\n(to which were attached cheques and bank notes) through the windows,\r\ntrusting to chance that they might be picked up. It is difficult to\r\npicture the eagerness, the plots, the rage of the excited multitude bent\r\non securing this, the magic scrip, which was to make the needy rich and\r\nthe embarrassed free.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing how the mania seized on all classes in Kimberley,\r\nfrom the highest to the lowest, just as Law’s scheme and the South Sea\r\nbubble did during the previous century; how every one, doctors and\r\nlawyers, masters and servants, shop-keepers and workmen, men of the pen\r\nand men of the sword, magistrates and I. D. B.’s, Englishmen and\r\nforeigners, rushed wildly into the wonderful game of speculation.\r\n\r\nOne financial agent told me he floated five companies in three weeks,\r\nviz.: The Fry’s Gully, Du Toit’s Pan; the De Beer’s Central, De Beer’s;\r\nthe Barnato Co., Kimberley; the Frere Co., De Beer’s; and the Globe Co.,\r\nDu Toit’s Pan; and that although the capital required for the five\r\ncompanies was £496,000 only, yet £1,230,000 passed through his hands in\r\nthe short time I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nBusiness of every kind was neglected, mining operations were all but\r\nsuspended, the sole topic being the share market and the profits to be\r\nmade there. Many made unexpected fortunes, and realized in a few months\r\ngains larger than those a whole lifetime of work and economy could have\r\nprocured them had they continued their ordinary pursuits. Under these\r\ncircumstances it was only natural that many owners of worthless ground\r\ntook advantage of the general excitement to form companies which had\r\nhardly the remotest possibility of success; it was evident that it\r\nmattered very little to the general public, or the majority at all\r\nevents, what the company was, what the value of the claims might be or\r\nwhere they were situated, so long as it was a diamond-mining company it\r\nwas quite sufficient to command public favor. The public bought shares\r\nin the diamond-mining companies as to-day they are doing in the gold\r\ncompanies, not to obtain dividends on their capital invested, but for\r\npurposes of pure speculation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most flagrant instances of bogus company promoting which ever\r\ncame under notice was the imposition attempted at a farm named\r\nFrankfort, situated in the Free State, about sixteen miles from\r\nKimberley.\r\n\r\nThis farm was prospected, diamonds found (?), a mine surveyed, claims\r\ngiven out, dams dug, shafts sunk and machinery erected, simply to\r\nbolster up a gigantic swindle, which but for the outspoken opinion of a\r\nsurveyor named Kitto would have been foisted, through a well known\r\nEuropean firm, who merely awaited his report, on the English public for\r\n£450,000. To assist in gulling home investors an American adventurer was\r\nactually sent to England with a parcel of beautiful diamonds, certified\r\nby affidavit to have been found in this mine, in order that those\r\nconcerned in introducing the scheme to the public might give visible and\r\ntangible proof of the enormous value of the property which they had for\r\ndisposal. Mr. Kitto’s report, however, decided the fate of what he terms\r\n“one of the most shameful swindles ever attempted.”\r\n\r\nMany a laughable story is told of how diamonds were turned out of, or—to\r\nbe more accurate—put into this mine. One probable investor on going down\r\na shaft to examine the ground at the bottom had a hail-storm of little\r\ndiamonds showered on him (some of which lit on the brim of his hat)\r\nwhich were meant for him to unearth in the loose ground at the bottom.\r\nThis wonderful discovery of the diamond’s new “locate” did not tend to\r\nincrease this gentleman’s opinion of the proffered investment! On\r\nanother occasion an astute matron interested in the swindle roundly\r\nbullied her servants for their carelessness in finding only seven\r\ndiamonds instead of eight, with which she had “salted” the wash-up.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, the “best laid schemes of mice and men gang\r\naft agley,” the bubble burst, and the proprietors of this wonderful mine\r\nallowed the knowledge of its startling richness to sink into oblivion,\r\nand found consolation and support in ministering to the bodily wants of\r\nthose whom business or pleasure took to that worked-out and forsaken\r\nGolconda.\r\n\r\nAs another example of how things were managed in those days when the\r\nshare mania was at its height, I may mention the case of a well-known\r\ncitizen who conceived the happy idea of putting into a company certain\r\nclaims in the Bulfontein mine which were then in his possession. These\r\nclaims were twenty-six and one-half in number, and the services of an\r\nenergetic promoter (who was to be paid £500 if he pushed the company\r\nthrough) having been secured, a prospectus pithily written was submitted\r\nto several well-known men who agreed to become provisional directors.\r\nThe capital of the company was stipulated to be £30,000, in 6,000 shares\r\nof £5 each, of which £1 was payable on application, a similar sum to be\r\npaid on allotment. The vendor, however, reserved 3,000 shares for\r\nhimself, so that only 3,000 were offered to the public. The _modus\r\noperandi_ of floating this company was somewhat unique. It was known\r\nthat locally the company could not go through, as the unkind assertion\r\nthat “half of the ground was in the street” was generally believed, but\r\nthat difficulty the diplomatic promoter overcame by sending copies of\r\nthe prospectus to agents in the Colony and Natal fully a week before it\r\nwas allowed to see the light of day on the Fields. This turned out to be\r\na rather clever dodge, for, before its publication in the local prints,\r\nthe secretary had in his possession sufficient applications by wire, the\r\nforms for which duly signed afterward came to hand, to insure the safety\r\nof the company. Locally there were but few applications. The first\r\ninstalment of the company, however, was only just subscribed for and the\r\nshare allotment made, when the collapse in the share market took place.\r\nWhat, however, is a singular thing in reference to this company is, that\r\nthe money paid on application and that paid on allotment, which must\r\nhave amounted to some thousands of pounds, has never yet been accounted\r\nfor. The directors fell away one by one, no work was done or machinery\r\nordered, and eventually the vendor became his own chairman, directors\r\nsecretary, trustee, manager and the general _multum in parvo_ of the\r\nCosmopolitan Diamond Mining Company, Bulfontein mine! It has transpired\r\nthat the shareholders’ money had not even been devoted to paying the\r\nlicenses on the claims, for I find that up to Feb. 1887, there was an\r\namount due to the London and South African Exploration Company (limited)\r\nof £2,008 for licenses on the claims from Sept. 1st, 1880. When this\r\ncompany was introduced to the public, one of the clauses of the\r\nprospectus read as follows:\r\n\r\n  “The well-known and regular returns of the Bulfontein mine are\r\n  proverbial, and most of the companies recently formed at a very much\r\n  higher rate per claim, are even now at a respectable premium; which,\r\n  coupled with the fact that all difficulties and obstructions having\r\n  been removed by the settlement arrived at between the claim-holders\r\n  generally and the London and South African Exploration Company\r\n  (limited), the provisional directors have all confidence in the future\r\n  of this company.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the vendor then stated that a settlement had been arrived at,\r\nyet in March, 1884, when sued by the London and South African\r\nExploration Company for the rent which was due to them, this gentleman\r\npleaded that the company had no title! Either his first statement in the\r\nprospectus or his last in pleading must have been audacious in the\r\nextreme.\r\n\r\nThe London and South African Exploration Company withdrew from the case,\r\nprobably to bring it on again at a later period.[53] Some shareholders\r\nare asking what has become of the money, and whether the company should\r\nnot be forced into liquidation, that the matter may be fully inquired\r\ninto. The promoter of the company was never fully paid, and many\r\noutstanding accounts were never settled.\r\n\r\nThe floating of this company and its subsequent history forms a novel of\r\nitself, and is another proof of the loose manner in which important\r\nbusiness involving thousands of pounds was transacted.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a time when a visitor to Kimberley could not help being\r\nstruck with the remarkable amount of business, legitimate and\r\nillegitimate, which was transacted in a place so lately a mere desert.\r\nAs I have already mentioned the streets were thronged with an eager\r\ncrowd, all engaged in the same pursuit, the purchase or sale of shares;\r\na pursuit which each one firmly believed to be the high road to fortune.\r\nWell-nigh every conveyance which arrived on the Fields brought new\r\ncomers, anxious to share in the supposed good fortune, all the hotels\r\nwere crowded, and from every drinking bar might be heard the popping of\r\nchampagne corks; for lucky speculators were lavish with their money,\r\nbelieving as they did that they had hit on an inexhaustible mine of\r\nwealth. Diggers who had hitherto scarcely managed to make both ends meet\r\nnow imagined themselves wealthy, as their claims had been put into\r\ncompanies at a price sufficient to make them comfortable for life; men\r\nwho before had been contented to work hard for five or six pounds a week\r\nsecured positions as managers of companies with comparatively enormous\r\nsalaries, clerks and shopmen became secretaries, and assumed all the\r\ndignity of their new positions, and lawyers were employed day and night,\r\ndrawing up agreements and trust deeds. The insatiate thirst for\r\nspeculation was not slaked by the opportunity afforded of drinking\r\nfortune’s drams in mining ventures alone. Although 113 of these were\r\nfloated, yet some score of other schemes were thrown out as baits to\r\ncatch the unwary investor. Brick, coal, laundry, transport, ironmongery,\r\nlabor supply, theatres, clubs, hotels, aerated waters, in fact the\r\nprosecution of every conceivable industry was changed from private hands\r\nto those of managers and directors, some directors becoming veritable\r\n“guinea pigs,” occupying seats at as many as from ten to fifteen boards\r\nat the same time.\r\n\r\nExtraordinary as it may seem, it is nevertheless a fact that in six\r\nmonths the nominal capital of the diamond mining companies rose from two\r\nmillions and a half to over eight, and the companies in number from half\r\na dozen to seventy-one; of these thirteen existed in the Kimberley mine,\r\nwith a total capital of £2,685,000; eighteen at Du Toit’s Pan, with a\r\ncapital of £2,200,750. De Beers had thirteen companies, whose united\r\ncapital was £1,334,100, while at Bulfontein there were sixteen with the\r\nmore moderate sum of £871,100. In addition to these there were about\r\neleven companies formed to work the outside mines, and the capital\r\nrequired for this purpose was estimated at £923,000. Some idea of the\r\nlarge scale on which it was proposed to conduct these operations may be\r\nformed from the fact that the total sum proposed to be devoted to the\r\npurchase of machinery was no less than £650,700. Taking all these\r\nmatters into consideration, it does not require very great experience in\r\nthe art of finance to realize that the community of Kimberley was\r\nplaying at a very dangerous game, and one which would sooner or later be\r\nattended with very serious results. Nor did the danger lie only in the\r\nfact that Kimberley speculated far beyond its capital, from the\r\ncommencement to the end the hastily formed companies had but little\r\nchance of success, their very trust deeds being irregular. Again, the\r\ngreed of the promoters exhausted the funds which should have been\r\ndevoted to the development of the property, claims were put in at a\r\nprice which rendered the payment of any but the most paltry dividends\r\nimpossible, whilst the favoritism and nepotism of directors caused\r\ninefficient men to be appointed to posts the occupants of which should\r\nhave had the utmost possible practical experience.\r\n\r\nAll this ought to have been clear to the old residents on the Fields,\r\nbut for some unaccountable reason they seemed blind for the time to all\r\nprinciples of common sense; the Kimberley investor—I mean, of course,\r\nthe _bona fide_ investor and not the mere speculator in shares—seemed to\r\nthrow his judgment aside altogether, and apparently believed that the\r\n“bonanza” from which he was to derive his future wealth was to be found\r\nin the ground, which, as he might have known, had scarcely paid for\r\nworking in the hands of the individual digger, and could not be\r\nexpected, even with the command of improved and costly machinery which\r\ncapital could secure, to pay even decent dividends.\r\n\r\nFor many months, until June 1881, in fact, shares continued to advance\r\nin price to the most absurd premiums, and the most outrageous reports\r\nwere taken as truths, while the influx of a considerable amount of money\r\nfrom colonial investors aided in fanning the breeze, which wafted the\r\nplace on the rocks and breakers of financial distress.\r\n\r\nThe first check which the mania received was given by the sudden action\r\ntaken by the local banks. The managers of these institutions had given\r\nway to the general excitement, and in fact had conduced to it by freely\r\nadvancing money on all kinds of bogus paper, and now they suddenly\r\nbecame alive to the fact that the security of the scrip of mining\r\ncompanies might not be so sound as at first sight it appeared to be, and\r\nrefused, for the future, to make any advances on this class of property.\r\n\r\nA loud cry of indignation was immediately raised from every quarter,\r\nspeculators who had been purchasing heavily and mortgaging their shares\r\nto purchase more, and who now found that their system would receive a\r\nfatal blow, naturally complained of these, as they termed them,\r\n“arbitrary and injudicious proceedings” on the part of the financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees the mania abated, at last shareholders commenced to\r\nrealize the fact that they had invested beyond their means, and what\r\nmade the matter more serious they found it impossible to sell at\r\nanything like the price at which they had purchased. The natural\r\nconsequence of this was a material fall in nearly all classes of shares.\r\nIn spite, however, of the tightness in the local money market, the\r\ncommunity by no means lost entire confidence in their pet schemes. To\r\nshow the justness of these opinions, I will mention one company in\r\nparticular, the “Barnato.” This was the smallest company in the\r\nKimberley mine, consisting of four claims only, and was introduced to\r\nthe public in March, 1881, at the enormous sum of £25,000 a claim, with\r\nan addition of £15,000 for working expenses, almost double the value put\r\nby any other company on their claims. The application list for shares\r\nwas open for an hour only, when the required capital was subscribed for\r\ntwice over, and in two days the shares were at twenty-five per cent,\r\npremium, at which price they changed hands freely. The faith of the\r\ninvestors in this company’s shares was fully borne out. During the\r\nsucceeding eighteen months (before the company’s claims were covered\r\nover with reef) it actually paid dividends on this exorbitant capital to\r\nthe tune of thirty-one per cent., distributing among its shareholders no\r\nless a sum than £35,650. The Central Company also paid in dividends\r\nduring the first three-quarters after its formation fifty-one per cent.,\r\nreaching a grand total during its first two and a half years of some\r\neighty per cent., the amount in figures amounting to £321,985, 18s. 6d.\r\nBut the majority of companies never paid any dividend at all for years,\r\nand some are even now not out of debt.\r\n\r\nWhen it became apparent that the place had not a sufficient amount of\r\ncapital to support its enormous number of mining undertakings, many\r\nplans were formed for the introduction of capital from Europe, and in\r\nthe hope of this object meeting with a successful issue, speculators\r\nstill continued to buy and sell shares, but as time went on and it\r\nbecame perfectly clear that the hope of any benefit being derived from\r\nthis source must be abandoned, the value of scrip gradually became lower\r\nand lower, until at last in many cases it was all but nil, and where\r\nthere were calls unpaid a minus quantity.\r\n\r\nThe decline in the value of shares in the market was enormous. Central\r\nshares in the Kimberley mine, which had an easy sale in March, 1881, at\r\n£400[54] per share were in 1884 almost unsalable at £25. Rose Innes\r\nshares which were sought after at £53 sank to £5, and a similar fall\r\nalso occurred in the shares of all the companies in the other mines of\r\nthe province. In the mines of the Free State the depreciation in the\r\nvalue of shares was more extraordinary still. An instance I well\r\nremember. A friend of mine after years of application to business,\r\ncombined with indomitable perseverance, amassed a large fortune, when he\r\nwas tempted to speculate in the Koffyfontein mine, to which I have\r\nalready alluded, during the months of June and July, 1881. He bought\r\nduring the height of the mania 1,200 Koffyfontein shares at £28 each,\r\nwhich were afterward within two years realized in his estate at 6d a\r\nshare. He thus lost over £30,000 on the one venture. This was far from\r\nbeing an unparalleled instance of men being completely ruined by the\r\nunprecedented fall which took place in shares at that time. Though the\r\ndiamond mania did not convey such widespread disaster as the South Sea\r\nbubble or the Mississippi scheme, yet it will be years before the effect\r\nof the South African “bubble year” of 1881 is forgotten.\r\n\r\nOn the time arriving when dividends were expected to be declared, in but\r\nvery few instances were the directors able to do so. Ground which had\r\nyielded well in the hands of private owners often proved entirely\r\nunremunerative under the joint-stock system, and the reason of this was\r\nevident; the digger when working on his own account required no office\r\nwith a highly paid staff; he was his own manager and secretary, he\r\nlooked keenly after his own interests, and would never have dreamed of\r\ntrusting the most vital matters in his business to a possibly\r\nincompetent servant.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that, generally speaking, the company system had\r\nproved a failure, but little attempt was made to mend matters. Things\r\ndrifted from bad to worse, until at last Kimberley entered on the worst\r\nfinancial crisis that it had ever experienced. The companies with few\r\nexceptions were more or less in difficulties. Pressed for their\r\nliabilities by the banks, they had in turn to put the greatest pressure\r\non such shareholders as had not paid all the instalments on their\r\nshares, and in very many cases their action was useless, as the\r\nshareholders were unable to meet the demands made on them. The\r\nconsequence was that the companies had to go into liquidation and work\r\nin the mines came to a partial stand-still. Kimberley was no longer the\r\nKimberley of the past.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely said that in its rash and reckless speculation\r\nKimberley was almost guilty of financial suicide, for not only was an\r\nall but fatal blow given to the industry which supported the place, but\r\nall confidence in its resources was for a time destroyed in the minds of\r\nits colonial neighbors and the home investing public. The good, sound\r\ninvestments, yielding large returns, to be made here, would startle the\r\nquiet folk who are satisfied with the “three per cents.” As an instance\r\nof the dividend paying capacity of some companies some months ago, I\r\ncannot help mentioning the Elma at Old De Beers; in November, 1883, the\r\nmarket value of its £10 paid-up shares was from 16 shillings to 20\r\nshillings, when with good management in less than eight months it paid a\r\nmonthly dividend averaging from two to three per cent., or for the\r\ninvestor who was lucky enough to buy in at the low prices, at the rate\r\nof 360 per cent. per annum.\r\n\r\nThe fact of Griqualand with its incalculable mineral wealth being now\r\nunited to the colony by the line of railway opened at the end of\r\n1885,[55] the knowledge that owing to this the cost of the production of\r\ndiamonds must be vastly diminished, together with the lessening of\r\ntheft, which the extension of the Diamond Trade Act to the colony and\r\nthe re-enactment of a similar ordinance by the government of the Free\r\nState must produce, will tend to give a spurt to digging operations.\r\n\r\nI shall next treat of the political stages through which the Diamond\r\nFields have passed from their discovery to the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n THE EARLY HISTORY OF THE DIAMOND FIELDS UNDER ADAM KOK, CORNELIUS KOK,\r\n“DAM KOK,” ANDREAS AND NICHOLAS WATERBOER.—THE DIAMOND FIELDS AND THEIR\r\n  GOVERNMENTS.—THE HOISTING OF THE BRITISH FLAG.—THE KEATE AWARD.—RUSH\r\nFROM THE RIVER TO THE DRY DIGGINGS.—PNIEL DESERTED.—THE COMMENCEMENT OF\r\n DIAMOND STEALING.—JUDGE LYNCH PUTS IN AN APPEARANCE.—DISCOVERY OF THE\r\n   KIMBERLEY MINE.—BRITISH RULE PROCLAIMED.—FREE STATE COURTS CLOSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter writing so far about the Diamond Fields, their past and present\r\ncondition, the climate, the geology, and the peculiar crime and\r\nlegislation there existing, I will now turn to the early history of a\r\nregion which, if it had not been for the wonderful discovery of\r\ndiamonds, would yet have been the home of the half-caste Griqua, the\r\nindolent Batlapin, the marauding Koranna, the pigmy Bushman or the\r\npioneer Boer.\r\n\r\nGriqualand West, the official name of this part of South Africa, is\r\nbounded N. E. by the Cape Colony, S. by the Orange River, N. by Bechuana\r\nLand, E. by the Orange Free State, and W. by the Kalahari Desert.\r\n\r\nThe chief inhabitants, the Griquas, are a mixed race, many of them\r\nhalf-castes, who came from the Cape Colony and settled near the Orange\r\nRiver under Adam Kok (himself a half-caste, his father being a Dutch\r\nBoer and his mother a Hottentot slave) in 1795, who in course of time\r\nresigned his chieftainship to his son Cornelius. Cornelius Kok, being\r\nabsent from his people for some time, during which he visited Lord\r\nCaledon in Capetown, found, on his return in 1816, the Griquas settled\r\ndown and his son, “Dam Kok,” reigning in his stead. Dam Kok, becoming\r\nrestless about this time, left Griqua Town in 1819, dying subsequently\r\nat Philippolis in 1837. Andreas Waterboer, formerly a schoolmaster and\r\npreacher under the London missionaries at Griqua Town was, after “Dam\r\nKok” left the district, unanimously chosen chief, and his appointment\r\nwas confirmed in 1822 by Lord Charles Somerset, governor of the Cape.\r\nAndreas Waterboer then set about redressing wrongs, was both\r\nwell-intentioned and useful to the British government, being a “friendly\r\nand sincere ally,” as well as hospitable and open-hearted to all\r\nvisitors, and by these means so consolidated his power that he received\r\na special recognition in the shape of a silver medal, which was sent him\r\nby Lord Charles Somerset. Notwithstanding this, although backed up by\r\nthe English government and Sir George Cathcart, he was continually\r\nworried by land disputes with Cornelius Kok (whom, in 1838, he had\r\ndeposed from his office of provisional captain) until his death on Dec.\r\n13th, 1852, relieved him from further trouble. His son, Nicholas, who\r\nwas then quite a boy, succeeded him. Troubles increased, the English\r\nabandoned the sovereignty (now the Orange Free State) in February 1854,\r\nand Nicholas Waterboer hemmed in, on the one side by the Transvaal and\r\non the other by the Orange Free State, formally appointed David Arnott,\r\non Sept. 1st, 1863, to act as his agent, which he had in reality been\r\nfor some years. Long before even diamonds were discovered, the Orange\r\nFree State had insisted that there could be no question as to their\r\nright to all the country between the Orange and the Vaal Rivers, but as\r\nthe district was of little value, no special steps had been taken by\r\nthat government to insist on their so-called rights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE WATERBOER MEDAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the first diamond was found in 1869, and attention consequently\r\ndrawn to the discovery, as I have before stated, the banks of the Vaal\r\nbecame peopled with diggers and prospectors, and Waterboer, at once\r\nseeing his necessity to deal with this large and increasing influx,\r\nceded all the land to which he laid claim, some 17,000 square miles, to\r\nthe English, the allowance of £150 per annum, which the English\r\ngovernment had paid to Adam Kok, Cornelius Kok, and then to Andreas, the\r\nfather of Nicholas Waterboer, being increased to £250, and afterward, in\r\n1877, to £1,000, with £500 a year to his widow after his death. The\r\nOrange Free State now asserted its rights, based upon its former demands\r\nof having purchased Adam Kok’s rights with the land in question. The\r\nmisunderstanding resulting between the English government and the Orange\r\nFree State, ending in the former giving the latter a compensation of\r\n£90,000, I shall more fully explain further on, but I may say here that\r\nNicholas Waterboer is a living example of the care (?) bestowed by the\r\nEnglish government, as a rule, upon those aborigines it may take under\r\nits fostering care. Nicholas Waterboer, formerly the undisturbed\r\npossessor of this valuable tract of country, now ekes out a miserable\r\nexistence at Griqua Town, having parted with his country, the farms\r\nallotted to him mortgaged, his pension swallowed up by hungry creditors,\r\nruined both in body and estate, a drunkard and virtually a pauper! I\r\nendeavored both in the Griqualand West legislature and in the Cape house\r\nof assembly to obtain some information respecting this poor chief and\r\nthe ultimate destination of his pension, but without success.\r\n\r\nAny one asked to describe the policy of governments in the diamond\r\nfields under the British flag would give no better answer than “making\r\npie-crust promises.” That was the policy of the first representative of\r\nBritish rule “under instruction,” and it has continued to be the most\r\nmarked characteristics of his successors. Every new “hand” that has been\r\nintrusted with the reins of government started on his career by\r\nreversing the policy of his predecessors and making promises, which, if\r\nhe ever meant to keep, he revoked shamelessly and recklessly, either to\r\ngratify his own caprice for party purposes, or under the “instruction”\r\nof the imperial nominee, whose seat is fixed in Capetown, and who\r\npuppet-like moves according to “wire.” It is therefore not to be\r\nwondered at if the inhabitants of the diamond fields have occasionally\r\nbecome furious and uncontrollable. The facts of the diamond field\r\nhistory speak for themselves. Early in 1871 there was a flutter amongst\r\nthe population digging for diamonds on the banks of the river Vaal,\r\noccasioned by the announcement that Mr. John Campbell, an official of\r\nthe Cape government, had arrived at Pniel to be British resident, to\r\nrepresent British rule under the Union Jack, to administer law and\r\norder, and to keep off at arms-length the two neighboring states, who\r\nwere bent on getting the territorial rights in their own hands; the Free\r\nState claiming all the land on the near, and the Transvaal that on the\r\noff-side of the river.\r\n\r\nThe English were jubilant, the Dutch furious. Mr. Campbell did not\r\nventure to hoist the flag on the Pniel side, for Mr. Truter, a subject\r\nof the Free State, was already sitting there as the representative of\r\nthe Free State and holding magisterial office under the flag of that\r\nrepublic. The great mass of the population moreover (which at that time\r\ncould not have been less than 6,000 souls) was Dutch, the proportion\r\nbeing about two to one. The Klipdrift bank of the river was peopled\r\nchiefly by Englishmen who were determined to hold the territory on which\r\nthey had settled against all comers; to preserve their nationality; to\r\npay no tribute to any Dutch state, and to secure their position by the\r\naid of British rule; so that, when Mr. Campbell arrived, they were quite\r\nready to welcome him and to rally round the British flag.\r\n\r\nA number of diggers went across the river to Pniel to escort Mr.\r\nCampbell across the Vall, and all who did not do so assembled at the\r\nlanding place on the Klipdrift side to receive him. He landed in\r\nKlipdrift amidst the cheers of the populace; a procession was formed to\r\naccompany him to his quarters, and when a day or two after he met the\r\ndiggers he was as prolific of promises as a bramble is of blackberries.\r\n\r\nAll the diggers’ committees then in existence bowed down to him, and he\r\nassured them that no private right either to land or to claims was to be\r\ndisturbed, that British titles would be immediately given to those who\r\nhad obtained land either by grant or purchase from the chiefs or their\r\nagents, and that the law would be administered precisely as in every\r\nother part of her Majesty’s dominions. Three commissioners, Messrs. H.\r\nBowker, F. Orpen and Buyskes, were appointed by proclamation to deal\r\nwith the land, holding their appointments from the high commissioner,\r\nand all parties holding documents showing them to have land claims were\r\nrequested to send them in at once to the commissioners, so that they\r\nmight have titles substituted for them.\r\n\r\nThe territory at this time no more belonged to the British government\r\nthan it did to the Mikado. Nicholas Waterboer, the chief of the Griquas,\r\nhad it is true tendered his rights to the British government, but that\r\ngovernment had not come to terms or closed with him. There were disputes\r\nbetween Waterboer and Janje, the chief of the Korannas and Batlapins;\r\nwhile Botlisatsi, a brother of Mankoroane, was contending that he was\r\nthe chief of his tribe, and that his land included Bloemhof and\r\nChristiana.\r\n\r\nBeside this the chiefs had no individual rights to land beyond those\r\ngiven them by their counsellors who represented the tribes, the native\r\nlaw being that the land belonged to the tribe, and that none of it could\r\nbe disposed of to private individuals. The white men who had been\r\npermitted to settle among them had none but squatters’ rights, though\r\nthe Boers had come in, marked out farms without leave being asked or\r\ngiven, had laid down beacons and denied that any natives had any rights\r\nover the land. When ordered off they refused to go.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell some little time after his arrival proceeded to settle\r\ncivil claims and to try criminal offenses, when it was discovered that\r\nhe held office under the joint authority of Waterboer and the British\r\ngovernment. This was a dilemma never calculated upon. The Griquas not\r\nbeing British subjects declined to be made subject to British laws, and\r\nMr. Campbell was instructed to administer Griqua laws for the Griquas\r\nwhenever it was applicable to the cases before him, and to do his best\r\nto satisfy all suitors. So Mr. Campbell, who had positively no legal\r\njurisdiction, mixed the Griqua and British-colonial law and got along as\r\nbest he could. The Transvaal government persisted in its protests\r\nagainst the British government exhibiting itself on the Klipdrift side\r\nof the river, and threatened to drive English and natives out of the\r\ncountry and claimed the land as their own. It was ultimately arranged,\r\nhowever, that this land dispute should be settled by arbitration, and\r\nthis brought about what is known as “the Keate award.”\r\n\r\nAn arbitration board of three was appointed, consisting of Mr. Campbell\r\nfor the British government, Mr. Jeppe for the Transvaal, and Mr. Keate,\r\nthen lieutenant governor of Natal, to act as referee. The arbitrators\r\nmet at Bloemhof, and witnesses were called from all directions, Griquas,\r\nKorannas, Batlapins, Barolongs, Boers and Englishmen all giving\r\nevidence. Of course the Transvaal and English arbitrators could not\r\nagree, and after a very protracted sitting Mr. Jeppe went “huis\r\ntoe,”[56] or home, Mr. Campbell following his example and returning to\r\nthe diamond fields.\r\n\r\nLieut. Governor Keate then took the matter into his own hands, completed\r\nthe arbitration and decided that the territory in dispute belonged to\r\nthe native tribes, and that the Transvaal had no shadow of claim to it\r\nor any part of it. The award, however, did not deal with details, the\r\nwhole of which and the conflicting claims of the natives were left to be\r\nsettled in the future. No beacons were laid down by the arbitrators to\r\nprevent after disputes, and as may be supposed it was not long before\r\nthe territorial and land questions bred troubles with which the civil\r\npowers were unable to cope without resorting to arms.\r\n\r\nMr. Campbell assured every one on his return that the British government\r\nhad won the arbitration, and his reasons for so considering were that\r\nalthough the award was formally recorded for the natives the territory\r\nwas sure to come into the hands of the British government. Those,\r\ntherefore, who had lodged formal land claims were all the more eager for\r\ntheir titles to be registered.\r\n\r\nThe land commissioners as soon as they commenced discussing the\r\nprinciple upon which land should be dealt with came to loggerheads\r\namongst themselves, Mr. Holden Bowker proposing that all the land at the\r\ndisposal of the government should be given out on the Queenstown system,\r\nof which he was the author, to which suggestion his colleagues were\r\nopposed, each having a plan of his own. The “Queenstown system” of\r\nsettling the land was granting to applicants land at a nominal rental,\r\neach grantee being bound to occupy the land personally, to keep a\r\ncertain number of men provided with arms and liable to be called out\r\nwhen needed to go on _commando_, and to appear at an annual review to be\r\nheld in the district.\r\n\r\nThe government to put an end to the wrangle informed the commissioners\r\nthat it was not their duty to grant titles nor to settle the principle\r\nupon which the land was to be given out. Mr. F. T. Orpen, who had been\r\nnominated surveyor to government, declined to hold the office of\r\ncommissioner any longer and sent in his resignation. He pointed out that\r\nit could not have been the original intention of the government that the\r\ncommissioners should only collect the documents upon which land claims\r\nwere founded, as one commissioner could have done that as well as three.\r\nThere is little or no doubt, however, that the fault attached to this\r\nbroken promise was committed at the instance of the imperial government,\r\nwho had not yet settled with Waterboer, fearing the heavy\r\nresponsibilities that would be involved in so doing.\r\n\r\nThis course of action made the Free State all the bolder in its demands\r\nand its authorities sent to Pniel demanding from the diggers the license\r\nmoney for claims and stands which, if paid, would have enriched the Free\r\nState treasury to the extent of at least £1,500 a month—the claim\r\nlicenses being charged at a rate of 10s. each per month.\r\n\r\nThe Berlin missionaries, who laid claim to Pniel as their property,\r\nprotested, and the English diggers, together with many of the Boers who\r\nhailed from the Cape Colony and were digging at Pniel at the time,\r\nrefused to pay.\r\n\r\nThe Free State threatened force. The diggers laughed at the menace when\r\nthe Free State government called out a _commando_, which was instantly\r\nresponded to by the Boers, and quite an army of Vrijstaat cavalry came\r\nover the border and encamped on a flat situated close to the river,\r\nabout three miles from the Pniel diggings. Tax-gatherers were sent in to\r\nwarn the diggers that if they failed to pay the army would move in and\r\nsmite them hip and thigh. Messages were returned more plain than polite.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were about 4,000 diggers at Pniel, so the Free\r\nStaters maintained “a masterly inactivity” for several weeks, when some\r\nof them rode into the camp and blustered considerably. The diggers\r\nsimply regarded their invaders as so many butts for ridicule, and the\r\nnatives, who thoroughly enjoyed the fun, added to the diggers’ amusement\r\nby jumping up behind the riders on the Boer volunteers’ horses, which\r\nwere gorgeously caparisoned with navy-blue saddle-cloths richly adorned\r\nwith embroidery of yellow and red braid, while other dusky humorists\r\nseized the tails of the horses, laughing and shouting with all the\r\nartless glee and _abandon_ of the sons of Ham.\r\n\r\nThe “army” saw it was useless to attack Pniel and some of the wisest of\r\nthem made their way back to their farms and donned their mole-skins\r\nagain. The bulk of them thought, however, that they would try and force\r\nmoney out of the diggers at the smaller camps, and selected for the\r\nexperiment Waldek’s plant (where a number of English colonists were at\r\nwork) thinking to take them by surprise, but the Free State Boers have\r\nno more love for being taxed than have their brethren in the Transvaal\r\nor in the Cape Colony, and certain of them in kindly sympathy took care\r\nto let the Waldek’s plant diggers know of the movements of the army.\r\nWhen the warriors rode into Waldek’s plant they found themselves face to\r\nface with armed men behind two small field-pieces and were given to\r\nunderstand that if they did not wheel about and be off they would be\r\nfired at. The advice of Bombastes, “begone brave army and don’t kick up\r\na row,” was given in sober earnest.\r\n\r\nThere was an immediate halt. A deputation was sent from the army to meet\r\na deputation from the diggers, and a mutual understanding was arrived at\r\nthat there should be no fighting. There was a general indulgence in the\r\ncups that cheer and also inebriate, and the Boer army returned as\r\nempty-handed as they came. Mr. Campbell did not venture to cross the\r\nriver to the side where there was a Free State magistrate, nor yet did\r\nMr. Truter, the Free State official, venture to steer his barque to the\r\nside where Mr. Campbell had hoisted the British flag.\r\n\r\nWhen the diamonds were first discovered Sir Philip Wodehouse was\r\ngovernor and high commissioner of the South African colonies, but he was\r\nrecalled before there was anything like a general rush to the fields,\r\nwhich only commenced in the beginning of 1870. Lieut. Governor Hay\r\nfilled the acting appointment until Sir Henry Barkly became governor and\r\nhigh commissioner in 1870, and the latter had not been long in the Cape\r\nColony before he came up; the Cape parliament having decided that he\r\nshould, between the sessions of 1870 and 1871, make all the arrangements\r\nfor annexing the diamond fields to the Cape Colony, and at that time the\r\ndiggers looked on this annexation as inevitable.\r\n\r\nSir Henry went to the Klipdrift side of the river and was received with\r\nthe most strongly-marked expressions of joyfulness at his arrival.\r\nTriumphal arches were erected and a banquet was given him, but he was\r\nvery reticent and little information as to how the fields were to be\r\ngoverned was gleaned from him. The chief point of interest elicited from\r\nhim being that the land would soon be given out.\r\n\r\nThis visit was followed by the establishment of a high court presided\r\nover by a single judge, Mr. Advocate Barry, (now Sir Jacob Dirk)\r\npresident of the court of the eastern districts of the Cape Colony. Mr.\r\nJ. Cyprian Thompson came as public prosecutor and there was soon a full\r\nbar, Mr. Campbell holding the position of resident magistrate and the\r\nlate Mr. Giddy being civil commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of diamonds at Du Toit’s Pan and Bulfontein in 1870 caused\r\na revolution in the order of things. The diamonds could at this time\r\nonly be obtained at Pniel and the other river diggings by the\r\ntroublesome operations of digging out and removing boulders of immense\r\nsize, some of which were many tons in weight. The labor, as may be\r\nconceived, was tedious to a degree when the diamondiferous gravel had to\r\nbe taken to the river, cradled, washed and sorted; all employed whites\r\nas well as blacks were standing in water half their time, and chills,\r\nague and fever were the natural consequences. There was no water at the\r\nDu Toit’s Pan or Bulfontein, the diamonds were found near the surface,\r\nand the diamondiferous stuff only needed sieving before it was ready for\r\nthe sorting table.\r\n\r\nThe rush from the river to what were called “the dry diggings” was one\r\nof the most remarkable ever recorded. In one week after the existence of\r\ndiamonds at Du Toit’s Pan in payable quantities was assured, Pniel,\r\nwhich had grown into a town with a population of at least 3,000, and\r\nprovided with shops, post-office, hotels, law courts, etc., became\r\nalmost forsaken with nothing to be seen of its past glories, nothing\r\nleft but the deep pits from which the boulders had been removed and a\r\nfew straggling remains of roads and mud buildings. The population of\r\nKlipdrift had been reduced by at least one-half, but the houses and\r\nstores there being chiefly built of stone could not be removed; and\r\nhere, too, were the English courts, the judge, the public prosecutor,\r\nthe headquarters of the frontier mounted police, of which force a number\r\nhad been moved up to the Fields together with the civil servants.\r\n\r\nAll that the English government claimed was the territory under the\r\nchieftainship of Waterboer. But the estate of Dorstfontein (Du Toit’s\r\nPan) was the property of a citizen of the Free State, and he, as others\r\nhad (although he was a British subject by birth), implicitly obeyed the\r\nlaws of that state and was prepared still to be loyal to it and to\r\nsubmit to any digging laws that that government might pass and proclaim,\r\nand to pay any tax or royalty that the Free State Volksraad and\r\ngovernment might see fit to demand. Mr. Truter, who had previously held\r\nhis court at Pniel and hoisted the republican flag there, opened a court\r\nat Du Toit’s Pan, and English and Dutch alike respected his edicts and\r\navailed themselves of his court.\r\n\r\nHappily for the diamond fields, diamonds were found on the Voornitzigt\r\nestate almost simultaneously with their discovery at Du Toit’s Pan, and\r\nthis estate had been purchased by Mr. Alfred Ebden (now the Hon. Alfred\r\nEbden, M. L. C.), of Old De Beers, on his first visit to Klipdrift, not\r\nwith the remotest suspicion that there were rich diamond mines on it,\r\nbut because of its close proximity to the already discovered diamond\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nWhen diamonds were found on this estate there was less difficulty in the\r\nBritish government obtaining land for offices and courts than there had\r\nbeen before, Mr. Ebden being a British subject and therefore desirous\r\nthat his property should be under his country’s flag, and he at once\r\nsaid that the government might take any ground which they might select\r\nas sites for the erection of buildings for official purposes.\r\n\r\nAt this time the local government was in the hands of three\r\ncommissioners, Messrs. J. C. Thompson and Campbell and Commandant Bowker\r\nof the frontier mounted police, who were responsible to and acted under\r\nthe instructions of the high commissioner. It was never clearly\r\nunderstood what their powers and duties were, nor could any one gather\r\nfrom their proceedings what it was intended they should do, except to\r\nact as buffers, so to speak, between the inhabitants and the high\r\ncommissioner, and between the high commissioner and the president of the\r\nFree State. They continued their offices or “seat of government” as they\r\ncalled it, at Barkly, placing Mr. Giddy on the Voornitzigt estate as\r\nresident magistrate and civil commissioner, and appointing a small body\r\nof police to do his bidding, while they themselves paid periodical\r\nvisits to the dry diggings, but never ventured into Du Toit’s Pan. When\r\nBulfontein was found an attempt to gain possession of it was made by the\r\nFree State, but that was successfully resisted by the proprietors and\r\ndiggers, who declined to permit what they called “the foreign yoke” to\r\nbe placed about their necks. The high court, the post-office and all the\r\nEnglish government offices were still centered in Klipdrift.\r\n\r\nWhilst the river diggings existed it was not a public complaint that the\r\nnatives stole diamonds. Occasionally a “nigger” was found to have\r\nconcealed one, being egged on to the theft by some dishonest person who\r\nwanted to get diamonds cheaply.\r\n\r\nWhen a diamond was discovered on a native he was “basted” with a\r\nsjambok. If he had disposed of it he was made to tell who bought it and\r\nthe fellow was kicked out of the camp. The natives did not then know the\r\nvalue of diamonds, and they brought those which they found to their\r\nmasters, but they were not allowed at the sorting tables and could only\r\nobtain diamonds from out of the claims. Very soon after the discovery of\r\nthe dry diggings the character of the population underwent a change.\r\nOriginally the diggers came from the colonies and adjoining states, and\r\nit was not until the early part of 1871 that Europeans came in any\r\nnumbers. Then the class which in the slums of London live without labor\r\nbegan to put in an appearance, as I have mentioned before, and pitched\r\ntheir tents in these diamond fields.\r\n\r\nFrom that time trouble began. They systematically bought stolen diamonds\r\nfrom natives or anybody, put up the niggers to all sorts of dodges by\r\nwhich their masters might be robbed, and on this becoming known Judge\r\nLynch manifested his presence by the burning of the tents in which these\r\nevil doers resided, which blazed away night after night.\r\n\r\nOne man was taken to a tree and Judge Lynch delivered judgment against\r\nhim to the effect that if he did not tell to whom he had sold the\r\ndiamond he should be hung up by the neck until he was dead, and that\r\nsuch should be the fate of all buyers of stolen diamonds. The rope was\r\nput around the neck of the condemned thief, but the threat was not\r\ncarried into effect, as those who were to perform the duty of\r\nexecutioners were told that they, living as they did under British laws,\r\nwould be held guilty of murder if they carried out the sentence, and\r\nappalled at this they held their hands, and the native, for aught I\r\nknow, lives to this day. White men keeping stores on the Voornitzigt\r\nestate were suspected, and one of them would no doubt have been torn to\r\npieces had not some of his friends and companions come forward to save\r\nhis life, when pale as death and shaking like an aspen leaf he declared\r\nthat he was innocent. Nobody, however, believed in his innocence then,\r\nnor has he yet succeeded in convincing the old residents in his\r\nunsullied integrity. But by the skin of his teeth he escaped the\r\nvengeance of his justly infuriated enemies.\r\n\r\nThe firing of tents went on, and the commissioners had no power to\r\ninterfere with any hope of preventing it; beyond a few policemen, they\r\nhad no force at their command whatsoever, and hence could effect nothing\r\nthemselves; they called, however, a meeting in front of the civil\r\ncommissioners’ office, which was attended by many hundreds of diggers\r\nand others, the popular speakers saying that if the government would do\r\nnothing to protect their diamonds against thieves that they would take\r\nthe law into their own hands. The commissioners were all present. Mr.\r\nThompson, on the part of the commissioners, was the only one who was not\r\ntrembling with fear. He said that he “would take care if any man, native\r\nor white man, was found either stealing diamonds, or in possession of\r\nstolen diamonds, he would punish him with the utmost severity of the\r\nlaw; but the law should not be that of Judge Lynch, and if he found a\r\nman setting a tent or other property on fire he would admit of no\r\njustification, and it would be useless for such a man to talk about\r\nstolen diamonds.” The learned gentleman would charge that man with\r\narson, and he might be sure that he would receive the penalty provided\r\nby law for that crime.\r\n\r\nHe also said that the commissioners were considering what could be done\r\nto afford diggers protection, and would let them know when they had made\r\nup their minds. The meeting wanted to know if the commissioners would\r\nmake up their minds by the following Monday. Mr. Campbell asked: “Will\r\nyou promise not to set any more tents on fire until after Monday, and we\r\nwill see what we can do?”\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson declined to be a party to any bargaining of that sort, and\r\nthe meeting separated. There was no tent burning for some time after\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nGovernment by nominee commissioners was a mistake from the beginning. In\r\nboth the elementary strength was lacking and the “main de fer”\r\n(certainly) and the “gant de soie” (probably) were both needed in\r\ndealing with so heterogeneous a community as that of the diamond fields.\r\nSir Henry Barkly exerted himself to the utmost to make it work\r\nsatisfactorily, but failed to do so. The system and the material were\r\nalike bad.\r\n\r\nHis excellency at that time thought that annexation would be perfected\r\nin the coming session of the Cape parliament, and was therefore anxious\r\nit should begin. That the commissioners must be got rid of was clear, as\r\nthe diggers had shown themselves so completely dissatisfied with the\r\nexisting order of things.\r\n\r\nThe land claimants had become clamorous for the titles which had been so\r\nlong promised but were not yet forthcoming. The parliament of 1872 was\r\nconvened but would have nothing to say to Sir Henry’s annexing\r\nproposals. This was another addition to the long list of promises which\r\nthe people in the Fields had found to be violated.\r\n\r\nThe high commissioner was furious and would have liked to tell the\r\nhonorable the house of assembly, his notions of the sense of honor\r\npossessed by M. L. A’s. who were in the majority. But scolding would not\r\nmend matters, and he therefore restrained himself from speaking out as\r\nhe would liked to have done.\r\n\r\nHis excellency’s dispatches to the secretary of state for the colonies\r\nhad inspired the imperial minister with confidence that the Fields would\r\nbe readily taken over by the Colony, but when he found that was not to\r\nbe he was no less furious than Sir Henry himself.\r\n\r\nThe adverse vote of the Cape legislature threw the onus of governing the\r\nFields on the high commissioner himself; his correspondence with the\r\npresident of the Free State was not only voluminous but provoked retorts\r\nfrom his honor which were not pleasant nor easy of reply, and\r\npersonalities and loss of temper ensued; in fact the antagonism between\r\nthese high officials was almost unprecedented, and existed for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nThe Boers of the Free State and all the Dutch in the Colony as well as\r\nin the Fields were in sympathy with the president, and they accused the\r\nhigh commissioner and the secretary of state for the colonies of having\r\nshamefully robbed the Free State of the territory for the sake of its\r\ndiamonds. This charge, I may add, was believed in by a great many beside\r\nthe Dutch, and it was asserted by some of the most influential journals\r\nin England that the home government would never have thought of setting\r\nup Waterboer’s claim to the territory in dispute had not diamonds been\r\nfound to exist in it. This, however, was altogether untrue, for Sir\r\nPhilip Wodehouse at the time when he was engaged in interviewing the\r\nBritish Kaffrarian annexation delegates at Aliwal North, who were\r\nopposed to the proposed absorption of their country by the Cape, was in\r\ncorrespondence with the president on the same subject, and complaining\r\nthat the Boers of the Free State were encroaching upon Waterboer’s\r\nterritory, and accused that state of having extended its boundaries\r\nbeyond those marked out when the sovereignty was abandoned.\r\n\r\nMoreover, long before any diamonds were discovered, Mr. David Arnott,\r\nthe agent of Waterboer, had sent numberless protests to the Free State\r\ngovernment respecting the Boer encroachments, and at a conference which\r\nhad taken place on the same subject had produced evidence which he held\r\nto be more than sufficient to prove that Waterboer’s claim was\r\nincontestable.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of July, 1871, the Colesberg Kopje, now the Kimberley mine,\r\nwas discovered, and in November of the same year the whole of the\r\ndiggings, without regard to title, were proclaimed to be under British\r\nrule. This was supposed to have been done in order to enable Sir Henry\r\nBarkly to perfect his arrangements for bringing about annexation during\r\nthe session of parliament in 1872. His excellency little knew then how\r\nhe was to be sold when the parliament met, but he afterward discovered,\r\nas we have seen, with how capricious and unreliable a house of\r\nrepresentatives he had to deal.\r\n\r\nThe manner of proclaiming British rule was unique, to say the least of\r\nit. The commissioners who were still in power, and a good many not in\r\npower, were in a state of mental fever about the hoisting “the flag that\r\nbraves” and proclaiming British rule. It was all very well for Sir Henry\r\nto instruct the commissioners to proclaim British rule, but who was to\r\nread the proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch in the Fields “swore with an oath or something as good,” that\r\nthey would not be “brought under the British yoke,” as they called it,\r\nand threatened to take arms and “deluge the Fields with blood” if their\r\nstate was deprived of the governing powers over the dry diggings. The\r\nEnglish on the Fields contrasted the proportions of the Dutch and\r\nEnglish populations, and the long odds against the latter if the Dutch\r\nshould show fight. The most timid were sure that the Dutch would rise to\r\na man, and the lives and property of the English would be sacrificed;\r\nand if the truth be told many an English colonist then in these diggings\r\nwould as soon have seen the Free State as the English flag flying over\r\nthem, and no wonder, seeing that imperial rule had been in several\r\ninstances the cause of disaster to South Africa. It is hard sometimes\r\nfor colonists to remain loyal and true to their nationality when they\r\nare treated with contumely, distrusted and scoffed at by the chief and\r\nsubordinates of the imperial colonial department, as has occurred more\r\nthan once in this colony.\r\n\r\nHowever, the morning of the 17th of November broke upon the diamond\r\nfields—the day on which the Fields from Klipdrift to the Modder River,\r\nthe whole area on which diamond diggings had been established, was to be\r\nproclaimed British. John Campbell, Esq., in his plaids and buckles, a\r\nmodel Highlander from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet,\r\nslipped out of his office door, and with his colleagues was driven in a\r\ncart to the margin of the Colesberg Kopje. This illustrious\r\ncommissioner, however, was not the man to “bell the cat;” that duty was\r\ntaken upon himself by the late J.C. Thompson, then crown prosecutor and\r\ncommissioner. The official car was surrounded by vehicles filled with\r\nloyals, loyals on horseback and loyals on foot, and Mr. Thompson read\r\nthe proclamation from the scroll, which he unfolded and then nailed up\r\nto a hoarding close by. There had been a government _Gazette_ published,\r\nbut its place of publication had not as yet been moved to the dry\r\ndiggings from Klipdrift, but whether the proclamation was gazetted or\r\nnot I have never yet been able to discover, for when Mr. G. W. Murray\r\nasked for it, when he was a member of the legislative council, he was\r\ntold by the government that the files had been lost!\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson, after nailing up a copy or the original proclamation, no\r\none knew which, drove off in the triumphal British car to Du Toit’s Pan,\r\nfollowed by a long procession of horsemen and vehicles, amidst the\r\nshouts of the street mob and the melodious strains of an extemporized\r\nband, which, in honor of the occasion, was playing a colorable imitation\r\nof “The Campbells are coming.”\r\n\r\nOn reaching Du Toit’s Pan, Mr. Thompson repeated his proclaiming process\r\nthere. The honorable gentleman unfolded a second scroll and read its\r\ncontents, and then nailed up proclamation No. 2 on a hoarding. There was\r\na great concourse of people who came to hear and see what was up. The\r\nmultitude was a motley one. There were diggers Dutch and English,\r\nstore-keepers and canteen-keepers, Dutch and English too, and diamond\r\nbuyers with unmistakable Whitechapel marks or Bevis marks upon them, if\r\nthe pun be pardonable. In the midst of the multitude stood the Free\r\nState magistrate and his clerk, both open-mouthed, very pale, and yet\r\nmore astonished than pale. On referring to the paper on the hoarding,\r\nthey found that Dutch as well as English had been enfolded in the arms\r\nof Britannia. There was no fighting, no bloodshed, but a good deal of\r\ntall talk. The Dutch authorities did not show bellicose intentions. The\r\nDutch magistrate merely closed his court, locked his office door, put\r\nthe key in his pocket, and paired off with his clerk to see the\r\npresident to report the aggressive proceedings, and his place in Du\r\nToit’s Pan “knew him no more forever.” The diggers went back to their\r\nwork, after the customary indulgence in alcoholic stimulants. The\r\ngeneral public exhibited few manifestations of joy, for it had even then\r\nbegun to be whispered that if this were to be the prelude of annexing\r\nthe Fields to the Cape, there was little in it for Griqualanders to\r\nglorify themselves over. A banquet was given at Benning & Martin’s\r\nhotel, Du Toit’s Pan, at which the officials secured front seats for\r\nthemselves and their friends, and made the speeches of the evening,\r\nextolling themselves and each other, and becoming as full of loyal\r\nsentiments as they were of “Mumm.” From that day forth the rule was\r\nBritish, or supposed to be, but with the exception that the people had\r\nto pay more taxes there was nothing to indicate that “a vast, great, and\r\nglorious change” had taken place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n   SIR HENRY BARKLY PAYS THE FIELDS A SECOND VISIT.—PROMISES THAT THE\r\n FIELDS SHALL BE A CROWN COLONY WITH A LEGISLATURE OF ITS OWN.—LETTERS\r\n  PATENT PROCLAIMING GRIQUALAND WEST A CROWN COLONY.—HONORABLE RICHARD\r\n    SOUTHEY FIRST LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.—AN INCIPIENT REVOLUTION.—THE\r\n  COURT-HOUSE SURROUNDED BY AN ARMED BAND.—THE BLACK FLAG HOISTED.—THE\r\n    REVOLT RIPENED.—COLONEL CROSSMAN.—THE CHANGES IN THE LEGISLATIVE\r\n              COUNCIL.—RECALL OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, the Cape legislature of 1872 broke faith with Sir\r\nHenry Barkly, who was thereupon accused by his imperial masters of\r\nhaving failed to keep the parliament in hand. The violation of pledges\r\nand promises has been a prominent characteristic of the policies alike\r\nof the Cape parliament and of the colonial office, and in both cases it\r\nhas been prolific of evil consequences.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barkly, owing to the unstable and vacillating policy of the\r\nCape parliament, found himself on the horns of a dilemma. The imperial\r\ngovernment taunted him with having shown a want of diplomatic tact in\r\ndealing with the colonial legislature, while the latter repudiated the\r\ncharge which Sir Henry Barkly brought against the legislative assembly,\r\n_i.e._, that of having broken faith with him. Nay, the two honorable\r\nhouses went even further, they vowed and declared that they had never\r\ndone or said anything to warrant his sending to the secretary of state\r\nfor the colonies the dispatches that he had sent. Here was a gordian\r\nknot for a governor to loose. What was he to do? He could neither report\r\nupon the colonial secretary, nor tell the parliament what he thought of\r\nthe latter functionary’s action; he virtually exclaimed: “A plague upon\r\nboth your houses, I’ll go to the Fields again myself.” So he made up his\r\nmind to order the government coachman to inspan the traveling wagons,\r\nthe panels of which, by the way, were ornamented with the royal arms\r\npainted by a Cape artist, whose idea of the lion and the unicorn was\r\nsublimely humorous—the lion having too much skull by half, and the horn\r\nof the unicorn being as crooked as a ram’s, or a satyr’s. His excellency\r\ntold his executive, that it was as plain as the Cape flats that British\r\nrule could not be administered in the diamond fields by commissioners\r\nand law courts, and that he was about to proceed to the Fields in order\r\nto see how the British flag was to be kept flying over the\r\ndiamond-digging community. But Sir Henry had been soundly abused by\r\npress and public, both in the colony and Griqualand West. The idea then\r\nprevailed at Capetown that the diggers would think no more of chopping\r\noff a governor’s head than they would of decapitating a domestic fowl.\r\nOn the Fields there was universal dissatisfaction, the commissioners all\r\nthe while remaining with virtually “no work to do.” The holders of\r\nclaims at Klipdrift had had to pay surveyors’ expenses which they had\r\nnever calculated upon having to pay, and also to meet other demands\r\nwhich they regarded as extortionate, if not almost fraudulent. There\r\nwere transfer dues, stamp duties and such like, to be enacted in the not\r\nfar distant future, and the aspect of affairs was not cheering. The Free\r\nState was wrathful and indignant, and the Boers there were threatening\r\nvengeance. The Dutch on the Fields complained loudly and bitterly of\r\nhaving to pay taxes to British extortioners and being forced to submit\r\nto law and order, and declared that the British embrace was too ursine a\r\nhug for their comfort.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Sir Henry Barkly did not feel quite sure that\r\nhis personal appearance on the Fields would not be made the occasion for\r\nan outbreak. Still go he must, and in order to ascertain how far he was\r\nrisking his life he remained at a farm outside the camp on the first\r\nnight of his arrival. The next morning, long before the breakfast hour,\r\nhe saw scores of vehicles and horsemen coming over the hill leading to\r\nthe homestead. It was an anxious moment. But there was the ring of the\r\ntrue British metal in the cheers of the horsemen as they neared the\r\nfarm, and Sir Henry was soon convinced that his second visit was\r\ndestined to prove even more acceptable to the Griqualanders than his\r\nfirst had been. The gubernatorial equipage, with Sir Henry and his\r\nadjutant, was soon on the move, and as the Fields bore in sight he could\r\nsee Bulfontein and Du Toit’s Pan in holiday dress. There was bunting\r\nflying from every flag-post, and the margin of the mines was crowded\r\nwith people, white and black. He was cheered all the way from his entry\r\ninto the Fields until he reached his quarters in Kimberley; flags\r\nfloated over his head, and triumphal arches spanned the roadways. On the\r\nday of his arrival he held a levee which was well attended, and he took\r\ncare to have it generally known that he would receive as many\r\ndeputations as liked to come to him to ventilate their grievances. Of\r\ngrievances there were enough and to spare, in fact there was nobody\r\nwithout one, either real or imaginary. First and foremost of all was the\r\nland grievance. Legitimate claimants and land jobbers jostled each other\r\nwithout mercy and with scant courtesy. The diggers insisted that they\r\nhad not been and were not protected as it was alleged they had been told\r\nthey were to be. Diamond thieves, they asserted, were more pestilent\r\nthan ever, having grown bolder and more unscrupulous, and the digging\r\npopulation suggested that if they had shown more regard for the\r\nprotection of their own property than loyalty to the government diamond\r\nstealing would have been considerably diminished. The trading community\r\nalso manifested extreme dissatisfaction, owing to the manner in which\r\ngovernment contracts were given out, the belief prevailing amongst many\r\nthat a system of favoritism if not of jobbery was in existence. The\r\nnatural result of these real or alleged grievances was that the local\r\ngovernment was in decidedly bad odor with the population generally.\r\n\r\nThe neighboring states had complained that guns and gunpowder were\r\nsupplied to natives, and a deputation defending the system of supplying\r\nthe natives with guns and gunpowder waited upon his excellency, who said\r\nthat his attention had been called to the fact that more guns were\r\nsupplied to natives than had been entered at the customs, where the duty\r\nwas £1 per barrel, a fact which he could not understand. The deputation,\r\nhowever, explained it by the open ports, where no custom-houses were\r\nestablished, further asking Sir Henry to consider the number of small\r\nvessels which visited these ports from the Natal and Cape ports. The\r\nguns sold here were supplied to the dealers by the merchants, and the\r\nformer paid the duty, although a large portion of it was lost to the\r\ngovernment. The natives at that time came here more for the sake of\r\ngetting guns than for money, and the deputation urged a sufficient\r\namount of labor to work the diamondiferous soil could not be obtained if\r\nthe supplying of guns to natives were prohibited. It was further pointed\r\nout to his excellency that the natives would even then continue to get\r\nguns from runners (smugglers), and that natives in the possession of the\r\nassegai, their national weapon, were more dangerous than when armed with\r\nguns. After hearing all the evidence and going into the question fully,\r\nSir Henry Barkly decided that the gun trade must not be interfered with,\r\nand this opinion Governor Southey afterward endorsed.[57]\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barkly promised that British title should be immediately given\r\nto legitimate land claimants, that contracts for government supplies\r\nshould be called for by public tender, and that all real grievances\r\nshould be removed. Protection was promised to the diggers, and so his\r\nexcellency became very popular indeed, a banquet followed by a ball was\r\ngiven to him at Kimberley on September 12th, 1872, and both were\r\ncompletely successful. The late Dr. Robertson, formerly of Fauresmith,\r\nO. F. S., filled the chair at the banquet and introduced Sir Henry\r\nBarkly to his entertainers in admirable style. The doctor’s speech in\r\nintroducing the toast, “the health of Sir Henry Barkly, her Majesty’s\r\nhigh commissioner in South Africa and governor of the Cape Colony,” was\r\ncouched in elegant and appropriate language, and his excellency’s reply\r\nwas received with enthusiastic applause. He told the assembled guests\r\nthat up to the time of his present visit he had had but a slight\r\nconception of the importance of the diamond fields, and had found them\r\nto be of such a character that he realized the fact that they could not\r\nbe governed by three commissioners. The wealth, intelligence and numbers\r\nof this community must have something better in the shape of government.\r\nTo think of governing them from Capetown was out of the question, and as\r\nhe found they were entitled to a government of their own he would take\r\ncare that they should have it. The Fields should be a crown colony with\r\na lieutenant governor and a legislature on the same model and as liberal\r\nas that of Natal, and this he would bring about as quickly as the\r\npreliminaries could be arranged. The ball over, Sir Henry paid a visit\r\nto Barkly where he held another levee, and there also a banquet was\r\ngiven him. The streets were decorated with flags, and triumphal arches\r\nwhich formed a complete roofing all through the main street. Here, also,\r\nthe gubernatorial promises gladdened the hearts of the populace,\r\nespecially those which referred to the land titles. At the banquet,\r\nwhich was given in the main hall of the Barkly club, it was endeavored\r\nto get a pledge from his excellency that Barkly should be the seat of\r\ngovernment, but the attempt was a vain one, his excellency contenting\r\nhimself by saying that they had the high court there and all the\r\ngovernment offices, and that he would not forget the old proverb: “Be\r\nsure you are off with the old love before you are on with the new.” In a\r\nvery short time after this, however, the high court and the government\r\noffices were removed to Kimberley, and the seat of government\r\nestablished there.\r\n\r\nOn his excellency leaving the Fields to return home, he had additional\r\nproof of the loyalty which animated the great bulk of the diamond field\r\npeople. He was escorted to Alexanderfontein by at least a thousand\r\npersons, and he expressed his gratification at the reception he had met\r\nwith there, and gave it as his opinion that her Majesty had no more\r\nloyal people in her empire than in the diamond fields of South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe special mission of Sir Henry Barkly to South Africa was to reform\r\nthe constitution of the Cape Colony by the introduction of responsible\r\ngovernment. That colony had become troublesome to the imperial\r\ngovernment, inasmuch as the old _régime_ parliament which had full\r\ncontrol over the government purse strings refused to pass the taxing\r\nmeasures necessary for the administration of the affairs of the country,\r\nand unfortunately for Sir Henry Barkly his executive was too much\r\ndivided for him to move with reasonable expectation of success. The\r\ncolonial secretary, Mr. Southey, was firmly opposed to the introduction\r\nof the measure into the parliament then assembled, as the country had\r\nnever been consulted on the question, which he held ought not to be\r\nforced. That honorable gentleman held to the doctrine as laid down by\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, that before responsible government is introduced into\r\na country the people must ask for it, and when it was decided by a\r\nmajority to introduce it the colonial secretary entered his solemn\r\nprotest on the minutes on constitutional grounds. This was awkward, but\r\nSir Henry Barkly received imperial instructions that it must be\r\nintroduced into the parliament, and that he _must_ get it passed. Sir\r\nHenry Barkly knew that if he should fail he would be recalled in\r\ndisgrace, and accordingly did introduce it in 1873 at an early session\r\nand managed to force it through the legislature, but when he called upon\r\nthe Hon. Mr. Southey to take office, that gentleman flatly refused to do\r\nso. He would not attempt to form a ministry, and he would not take\r\noffice either as premier or in any other capacity. It now became\r\nnecessary for his excellency to consider what should be done with the\r\nHon. Mr. Southey, and he was offered the lieutenant governorship of\r\nGriqualand West with an adequate salary, and the recommendation to take\r\nwith him his long-tried confidential clerk in the colonial office, Mr.\r\nJohn Blades Currey. Mr. Southey accepted the appointment, and the\r\ninhabitants of Griqualand West, especially the old colonists residing on\r\nthe Fields, received the intimation with extreme satisfaction, for Mr.\r\nSouthey enjoyed the confidence of both East and West. On the lieutenant\r\ngovernor’s arrival here, on January 9th, 1873, he was received with\r\nmanifestations of great joy. The people went out in great numbers to\r\nwelcome him at Alexanderfontein; triumphal arches were erected; bands of\r\nmusic preceded the procession into the towns; a display of fireworks and\r\nan illumination were amongst the tokens of rejoicing, and he was\r\nentertained at a banquet in the Theatre Royal, which was crowded to\r\nexcess.\r\n\r\nAn executive was created consisting of four members, viz.: the\r\nlieutenant governor, the secretary to government (Mr. Currey), the crown\r\nprosecutor (Mr. J. C. Thompson), and the treasurer general (the late Mr.\r\nR. W. H. Giddy). No constitution was proclaimed for some time after Mr.\r\nSouthey’s arrival, and the Fields were governed by the lieutenant\r\ngovernor and his executive, legal enactments being made by means of\r\nproclamations. One of Mr. Richard Southey’s first proclamations, issued\r\non Feb. 5th, 1873, almost immediately on his arrival, and which pleased\r\nthe diggers very much, was one to restrain the jumping of claims.\r\nPrevious to this, a claim in any one of the mines, which might be worth\r\nthousands of pounds, if left by its owner unworked for three days, could\r\nbe legally seized by any man who could prove this neglect; but the\r\nproclamation containing the letters patent declaring the colony of\r\nGriqualand West a crown colony was not promulgated until the July 16th,\r\n1873, when Klipdrift was rechristened Barkly and the “Colesberg Kopje”\r\nKimberley. The new names were given in honor of the then secretary of\r\nstate for the colonies, Lord Kimberley, and of Sir Henry Barkly. They\r\nwere created electoral divisions, the third consisting of the outlying\r\nor agricultural districts, being grouped together under the name of Hay,\r\nin honor of Lieut. Governor Hay, who was the first to unfurl the British\r\nflag over the Diamond Fields. The chief town of the last-named division\r\nwas Griquatown, in which the Griqua chief Waterboer resided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE VAAL RIVER DRIFT, NEAR BARKLY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe constitution was, however, not received with anything like unanimous\r\napproval. The boundaries fixed were disputed by the neighboring States,\r\nand the enfranchisement and representation was by no means in accordance\r\nwith the promises made by Sir Henry Barkly, inasmuch as it was not\r\naccording to the Natal model. The legislative council was constituted on\r\nthe deadlock principle, consisting as it did of eight members, four\r\nnominated by the general government and four elected by the voters, the\r\nlieutenant governor being president and having the casting vote. The\r\ngovernor had a power to veto in the first place, and the Queen in the\r\nsecond. At first it was said that no one would consent to be put into\r\nnomination for the four seats to be filled by the votes of the people.\r\nHowever, when the time of the elections came round, the seats were hotly\r\ncontested. The council was first convened in 1873, but did not meet for\r\nbusiness until January, 1874, when the elective members were Messrs.\r\nGreen and Dr. Graham for Kimberley, Mr. Advocate Davison for Barkly, and\r\nMr. David Arnott, the agent for Waterboer, to represent the electoral\r\ndivision of Hay. The first ordinance, viz. for the better regulation of\r\ndiggings and mines, was promulgated on the 30th of the month named. The\r\ngovernment and legislature for some time worked very well, but then a\r\nlack of cordiality among the members of the government themselves in the\r\nexecutive manifested itself, and there was as well no lack of\r\nrevolutionary agitators to stir up the people to rebel against the\r\ngovernment from the outside. Among the agitators were one or more\r\ngenerally accepted as Fenians, and several foreigners; the former with a\r\nhatred of British rule were bent on creating disturbances. They were\r\njoined by men who, although owning themselves British subjects, had\r\nparty and personal ends to serve, dearer to them than their reverence\r\nfor the crown. Leagues were formed and meetings were held, where\r\nsedition was loudly and plainly talked, mass meetings were convened on\r\nthe market place, and the governor roundly abused. The lieutenant\r\ngovernor offered to receive deputations and to discuss matters, provided\r\nthat the deputations should be composed of men who were known to be in\r\nthe habit of conducting themselves in a becoming manner. But the\r\nagitators wanted their followers to come in large bodies, and this the\r\nlieutenant governor decided not to permit. The members of the league\r\nassembled armed for drill, and assumed a most warlike and threatening\r\nattitude. The lieutenant governor urged the necessity of the presence of\r\na small body of her Majesty’s troops, and pointed out that moral force,\r\nthe only force at his command, had no influence upon the men who, led by\r\na clever and excitable digger named Aylward, were plotting against law\r\nand order. No attention whatever was paid to the suggestion of the\r\nlieutenant governor by the executive of the Cape Colony. There were no\r\ndefinite grievances brought forward by the men under arms, who were mere\r\npuppets in the hands of the riotously inclined wire-pullers. There were\r\ngrievances, however, of a grave nature, and the non-fulfilment of\r\npromises respecting the land titles was the greatest of all. It is only\r\nright, however, to mention that the majority of the white population,\r\naliens as well as British subjects, were thoroughly satisfied with Mr.\r\nSouthey’s rule; and he had, during the time he was at the head of the\r\ngovernment, done all in his power to make the people happy and\r\nprosperous, while the foundations of law and order had been so far as\r\npossible “both well and truly laid.” The social state of the Fields was\r\nexcellent, and Government House was so thoroughly well-conducted that it\r\nled society with a genial and assuring hand. Balls and parties, indoor\r\nand outdoor pastimes and pleasures, afforded the recreation which the\r\nbusy population required, and life in the Fields was generally pleasant\r\nand seemly.\r\n\r\nArmed malcontents were now drilled in the public squares, and wherever\r\nthey thought their proceedings would be most exasperating to the\r\ngovernment and the loyal portion of the community.[58] This was kept up\r\nduring the early part of 1875. Arms were imported from all directions\r\nand concealed in stores and licensed liquor shops, and in the month of\r\nApril of that year the mob were led into open rebellion, the occasion\r\nchosen for the outbreak being the seizure of arms by the magistrate and\r\npolice of Kimberley, and the arrest of the man on whose premises they\r\nwere discovered. A body of armed men marched down to the magistrate’s\r\noffice and demanded the release of the prisoner, the court-house being\r\nsurrounded and an attack threatened should their demand be refused. A\r\nblack flag to be hoisted on the edge of the Kimberley mine was to be the\r\nsignal for the revolters to fire upon the court-house and government\r\noffices. The Kimberley prison was to be leveled to the ground, when, as\r\nthe rebels calculated, the liberated prisoners would instantly swell\r\ntheir ranks and help to overthrow the government. The lieutenant\r\ngovernor refused to make any terms whatever with men under arms and\r\nordered them to give up their weapons to the government. This they\r\nrefused to do. The authorities were not, however, to be driven from the\r\nposition they had assumed. A number of loyal inhabitants volunteered to\r\nassist the government, and the prison was guarded by these assisted by\r\nsome of the police. Greatly to their credit the Germans then came\r\nforward almost to a man and joined the volunteers. Mr. James Anthony\r\nFroude, “the eminent historian,” as he is called, had paid a visit to\r\nSouth Africa at the instance of the Earl of Carnarvon, then secretary\r\nfor the Colonies, to report on the chances of federating the whole of\r\nthe Colonies and States under the British flag, and that gentleman, with\r\nhis characteristic mental twist, took a most distorted view of\r\neverything he saw, and instead of supporting the lieutenant governor\r\ndisparaged him, and actually held a conference with the rebel leaders.\r\nThis conference did not take place in the presence of any of the\r\nauthorities, and the insurgents declared at the time that their course\r\nof conduct had secured Mr. Froude’s[59] approval. This was before they\r\nbroke out in actual revolt. A quotation from Mr. Froude’s writings,\r\nwhich appears in a book of which one of the most bitter opponents of the\r\ngovernment is the author, strengthens the belief that Mr. Froude\r\nactually did encourage the rebels, whether intentionally or not. The\r\npassage is as follows: “The English government in taking up Waterboer’s\r\ncause, have distinctly broken a treaty which they renewed before in a\r\nmost solemn manner, and the colonial office, it is painfully evident to\r\nme, has been duped by an ingenious conspiracy.”\r\n\r\nThe “ingenious conspiracy” was one of those flights of imagination in\r\nwhich the eminent historian occasionally indulges with most mischievous\r\nresults to the colonies that he has visited and attempted to describe.\r\nThere was no such thing as an “ingenious conspiracy to delude the\r\ncolonial office,” as may be gathered from the facts before stated\r\nrespecting the action of Sir Philip Wodehouse in the matter of the wrong\r\ndone Waterboer by the Boers of the Free State. The chieftainship of\r\nAndreas Waterboer, the father of Nicholas, was confirmed by the British\r\ngovernment before Nicholas was born, as is shown in the earlier portions\r\nof these pages. This is wandering from the subject of the revolt, but\r\nthe necessity for this digression will be manifest to the reader.\r\n\r\nThe rebels had calculated that no magistrate would be found with\r\nsufficient courage to sit on the bench and try the arrested prisoner\r\nwhile the court-house was surrounded by men armed with guns and\r\nrevolvers ready to fire at a given signal. They were mistaken, however,\r\nfor the late Mr. Advocate Gray, then president magistrate of Du Toit’s\r\nPan, took his seat on the bench, and then the Fenian leader, sword in\r\nhand, ordered the man appointed (one Albany Paddon[60]) to hoist the\r\nflag, which was accordingly done. There was no firing, though one gun\r\nwas accidentally discharged. Some of the leaders began to reflect and\r\ncame forward and entered into bail bonds for the prisoner. The rebels\r\ndid not then, however, put down their arms. It was only after the high\r\ncommissioner had threatened to send troops that they consented to do so.\r\nColonel Crossman, who had been sent out as royal commissioner in Oct.\r\n1875, to make inquiries and report, after taking evidence absolved the\r\ngovernment of all blame. Then when the mischief had been done troops\r\nwere sent up at an expense of £20,000, under the command of Sir Arthur\r\nCunningham. Beyond showing that the imperial government were determined\r\nto uphold law and order, the troops did nothing but manœuvre in the\r\nmarket place, encamp at Barkly and attend balls and banquets given in\r\ntheir honor, as well as to fête the Diamond Fields horse, who had\r\nshortly before so gallantly fought under Sir Arthur in the war on the\r\nnortheastern frontier, driving Kreli out of the country and bringing his\r\ntribe into subjection. The real grievance—and one destined to produce\r\ndire consequences upon the province—the delay in giving out titles and\r\nsettling the land, had as yet found no remedy. Not even the chief\r\nWaterboer had been settled with, and Mankoroane, the chief of the\r\nBechuanas, harassed on all sides by the Boers, had called upon the\r\nBritish government for protection, offering to make over his territory\r\nand people to the queen, as Waterboer had done before him. He, like\r\nWaterboer, had always been loyal to the British rule, and to use his own\r\nwords: “I have always been true to the queen, have protected her people\r\nwhen they were in danger from the Boers, and now when my people are\r\nbeing crushed out of existence by the Boers the queen ought to protect\r\nme and my people.” The lieutenant governor was of the same opinion, and\r\nhe suggested to the high commissioner that in justice and in policy the\r\nBritish government could not do better than annex Bechuanaland. His\r\nexcellency further pointed out that to leave this fine country open was\r\nto pave the way for future troubles—which it has done. The high\r\ncommissioner encouraged the scheme. Mankoroane and his councillors with\r\na number of his people came down to Kimberley, if I recollect rightly,\r\nat the very time of Mr. Froude’s visit, and long conferences then took\r\nplace between the chief and his advisers, and the lieutenant governor\r\nand his, the old chief being ultimately given to understand that he and\r\nhis people and country were to be taken over, as Mr. Southey said, with\r\nthe knowledge and consent of the high commissioner. This was another of\r\nthe promises made only to be broken; and to prove beyond question that\r\nall the troubles predicted have come about, it is only necessary to\r\nallude to recent historical events culminating in Sir Charles Warren’s\r\nexpedition to Bechuanaland. Mr. Southey had from the time of his taking\r\noffice persistently requested the high commissioner to get the land\r\nquestion settled, and had sent warning after warning that delay in\r\ngiving out the titles was fraught with the greatest possible danger. But\r\nthe high commissioner was in the hands of the secretary of the colonies\r\nin the first place, and in the second his excellency had not mastered\r\nthe situation. Then those who fomented discontent and disturbance had\r\ncirculated, among other infamous slanders, that the lieutenant governor\r\nand the secretary to government were men bent on land-jobbing in their\r\nown interest and in the interest of their friends and political\r\nadherents.\r\n\r\nIn the session of 1875 the high commissioner, despite his previously\r\nissued reassuring proclamation to the effect that no private rights\r\nshould be disturbed, sent up a land ordinance drafted in Capetown, and\r\nrequested the lieutenant governor to introduce it to the legislative\r\ncouncil and get it passed into law. This the lieutenant governor\r\nrespectfully but firmly refused to do. By the draft ordinance a land\r\ncourt was to be created, and a judge appointed to decide upon the claims\r\nof every one, no matter whether his claims were disputed or not. Even\r\nWaterboer himself, from whom the government had derived all their\r\nterritorial rights, was to be forced into court and pay the expenses\r\nhimself, to prove that his private properties, farms, etc., belonged to\r\nhim. The judge was, moreover, to have power to reduce the size of farms,\r\nand in no case to permit one to be given out of more than 6,000 acres in\r\nextent. The lieutenant governor held that by allowing this ordinance to\r\npass into the statute book the government would be abrogating its\r\nespecial function, which was to protect those who could produce\r\nunimpeachable titles, whether obtained by grant, purchase or other\r\nlegitimate means. The cost of going to law to obtain them they, he said,\r\nought not to be compelled to incur. The law courts ought not, he\r\nmaintained, to be called upon to deal with any land claims excepting\r\nsuch as were in dispute. The executive government could deal with the\r\nundisputed claims, exchange British for existing titles, etc., thus\r\nsaving expenditure and delay, while the high court was quite sufficient\r\nto deal with disputed claims.\r\n\r\nThe high commissioner paid no heed to the lieutenant governor’s\r\nremonstrance, but came from Capetown to the diamond fields and\r\nintroduced the draft ordinance into the council himself, while\r\npresiding, as he was empowered to do, when in the province. The\r\npopularly elected members at first declared that they would not vote for\r\nthe measure; nor would they even take their seats; which course, had it\r\nbeen adhered to by them, would have effectually prevented the measure\r\nbeing carried, as no business could be transacted unless two of the\r\nelected members were in their seats. The high commissioner, however, by\r\nthe free use of his powerful influence, led the elected members to alter\r\ntheir determination, hinting that if they did not take their seats, a\r\nproceeding equivalent to assisting in passing the ordinance, he would\r\ndissolve the council, and every one saw that if the high commissioner\r\ncould not control the council the constitution under which it was\r\ncreated would be abolished altogether. The members took their seats, and\r\nthe ordinance was forced through and became law. The land court was\r\nestablished, and Mr. Advocate Stockenstrom, of the supreme court, who\r\nwas then practicing at the bar of the court of the eastern districts,\r\nwas appointed the judge.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Barkly, having forced his land bill through the council,\r\nreturned to Capetown, leaving Mr. R. Southey at the head of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible disaffection toward the land court soon found\r\nexpression on all sides. The editor of one of the newspapers, _The\r\nDiamond News_, criticised the decisions of the judge with great freedom,\r\nand amongst other remarks said that: “Judge Stockenstrom appeared to be\r\nperforming his duties under instruction, and if he was not doing so he\r\nwas incompetent for the office.” The editor was summoned before the\r\ncourt by Judge Stockenstrom, and was charged with contempt of court. He\r\nso ably defended himself that the judge withdrew the charge in a\r\nsemi-apologetic manner, but that did not allay the dissatisfaction. The\r\nadvocate of Waterboer, on the ground that his client had been grossly\r\ninsulted by the judge, and could hope for nothing like justice in that\r\nland court, retired, with his client from the court, and refused to\r\ncontinue his case.\r\n\r\nThe final adjustment was intrusted to Major, now Gen. Sir Charles\r\nWarren, the land court having been abolished and the judge withdrawn.\r\nMr. R. Southey, soon after the purchase of the farm Voornitzigt, which\r\nwas sold to government for £100,000, was recalled, and that was the last\r\nof Lieut. Governor Southey in Griqualand West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n        MR. JUSTICE BARRY ACTING ADMINISTRATOR.—ARRIVAL OF MAJOR\r\n LANYON.—PRINCIPAL EVENTS OF HIS ADMINISTRATION.—ANNEXATION BILL PASSED\r\n   CAPE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.—CRIMINAL PROSECUTION OF THE EDITOR OF THE\r\n        “INDEPENDENT.”—ATTORNEY GENERAL SHIPPARD’S ARGUMENT AND\r\n    ORATORY.—ACQUITTAL OF ACCUSED.—GREAT REJOICINGS.—ACTION AGAINST\r\n                        “INDEPENDENT.”—APOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the Southey _régime_, Mr. J. D. Barry, the\r\nrecorder of the province, held the reins of government for a time,\r\npending the arrival of Major Lanyon, an officer who had distinguished\r\nhimself on Sir Garnet Wolseley’s staff in Ashantee.\r\n\r\nThe posts of lieutenant governor and colonial secretary were abolished,\r\nand Major Lanyon as administrator, with Mr. Francis Villiers as private\r\nsecretary, conducted the affairs of the government. The principal\r\nmatters of interest during his day in Griqualand West were the passing\r\nof the annexation bill through the Cape house of assembly, the\r\ndisturbances of the natives, necessitating the expedition to Phokwane,\r\nthe quelling of the Griqua revolt, the trial of the editor of the\r\n_Independent_ and the passing of Mr. Geo. Bottomley’s bill amending the\r\nliquor ordinance.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the restless character of the diggers of the\r\ndiamond fields which culminated in the rising on April 12th, 1875, had a\r\ngood deal to do with the desire of the home government to get rid of the\r\nbother, annoyance and responsibility of governing so small, and at the\r\nsame time so troublesome, a crown colony as Griqualand West. With that\r\nobject a bill, of course at the instigation of the imperial authorities,\r\nwas brought before the Cape assembly in June 1877, when a select\r\ncommittee was appointed, of which Mr. Richard Southey, formerly\r\nlieutenant governor of this territory, was appointed chairman, which had\r\n“instructions to restrict its inquiry to the number and description of\r\nthe population, the extent and value of land, and the cultivation and\r\nother resources, the revenue and expenditure and general financial\r\ncondition of the province.”\r\n\r\nMajor W. O. Lanyon, C. M. G., the administrator, went to Capetown and\r\ngave evidence before this committee; and although of course wishing to\r\npromote the desires of the imperial government, his answers to all the\r\nquestions asked him evidently tended to make good what was generally\r\nunderstood to be his opinion, viz. that annexation was a doubtful\r\nmeasure at best, and that a province with mines of undisputed richness,\r\nwhose only debts were £90,000 to the Free State, £16,000 to the imperial\r\ngovernment for the expense of troops sent up there to quell the\r\ndisturbances in 1875, and about £16,000 to the Standard Bank, was quite\r\njustified in retaining its own individuality. However, as will be seen\r\nin the sequel “Molteno (premier of the Cape Colony at the time)\r\nincorporated the major.”[61] The bill to annex Griqualand West to the\r\nCape Colony passed the Cape assembly during the same session and\r\nreceived the queen’s assent in the following year, but became, so far as\r\nthe inhabitants of the diamond fields were concerned, almost forgotten\r\nuntil the visit of Messrs. Sprigg and Upington in October, 1879, when\r\nMr. J. Rose Innes, C. M. G., was acting administrator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANNEXATION.—MELANCHOLY END OF GRIQUALAND WEST. MOLTENO TO ENCORPORATE\r\n    THE MAJOR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Affairs of State” did not run altogether smoothly in Griqualand West.\r\nWhen Major Lanyon returned he found that the late Mr. Advocate Davison,\r\nmember for Barkly, had resigned his seat in the Griqualand West council\r\nand left for England, and there were but three elected members in\r\ncouncil when he introduced his annexation motion, to which he desired to\r\ngain their assent. Mr. Advocate Halkett, the senior member for\r\nKimberley, and Mr. R. W. Murray, the member for Hay, contended that\r\nbefore such a vastly important change was made as the annexation of the\r\nprovince to the Cape Colony, which involved the destruction of its\r\nconstitution and government, there ought to be a full council to discuss\r\nthe submitted resolution, and they therefore demanded that the seat for\r\nBarkly should be filled up. This the administrator refused to do, or\r\nrather implied that he had contemplated doing so, but had neglected it.\r\nHe evidently was determined to get his motion carried, while the members\r\nfor Kimberley and Hay were equally determined that if he should do so,\r\nit would be by his own casting vote alone; and knowing that they were\r\nmasters of the situation, they bowed themselves out with the\r\nannouncement that they would not return until all the constituencies\r\nwere represented. They kept their word. There was no election for Barkly\r\nand no more sittings of that council, which was shortly afterward\r\ndissolved, and it was not until some months had passed that a new one\r\nwas elected. There were three councils in all. The names of the first\r\nmembers have been before given; the elected members of the second\r\ncouncil, which was elected after the arrival of Major Lanyon, were\r\nMessrs. Tucker and Gilfillan (Kimberley), Davison (Barkly), and Murray\r\n(Hay). A vacancy occurred through Mr. Henry Tucker becoming\r\ndisqualified, and the late Mr. Halkett was elected in his place. The\r\nnext council, which was elected on Nov. 30th, 1878, consisted of myself\r\nand Mr. Bottomley (Kimberley), Mr. J. Paddon (Barkly), and Mr. J. Orpen\r\n(Hay).\r\n\r\nAn act of the colonial legislature which is not put into force within\r\nthree years of its having been assented to at home becomes a dead\r\nletter, and it was not until this period had nearly expired that the\r\nconcluding scene was put on the stage of the little theatre of the\r\nGriqualand West council, under the management of Mr. J. Rose Innes, but\r\nthis I will describe later on.\r\n\r\nThere is no hiding the fact that during Major Lanyon’s administratorship\r\nthere was a good deal of hostile feeling shown against him in some\r\nquarters, which was fostered by many who held the opinion that the major\r\nwas inclined to be more of a martinet than if he had had the training of\r\nan officer in a regiment other than one of those in which Charles\r\nLever’s Major Monsoon would have found congenial companionship, and in\r\npolitics at least his peculiar idiosyncrasies, as displayed toward\r\nopponents, would have caused the late Dr. Johnson, had he known the\r\nmajor, to admire his talents as a “good hater,” although at the same\r\ntime he would not have found him wanting in that opposite quality which\r\nis said to naturally follow. I have often heard Major Lanyon say:\r\n“Gentlemen, if I have ever erred, it has been the fault of the head, not\r\nof the heart,” and I may here state that the gallant major’s abilities,\r\nwhich were of no mean order, and his honesty of purpose, always received\r\ndue recognition. The want of tact of this administration, and the\r\nunfortunate personal leaning of its chief, were strikingly exemplified\r\nby a case in point, in the prosecution of the editor of the\r\n_Independent_ for an alleged criminal libel published in the issue of\r\nthat paper of Nov. 16th, 1876. At that time the trade in diamonds with\r\nroguish natives employed by diggers which unscrupulous persons carried\r\non, though they must have well known these cheaply acquired gems to have\r\nbeen stolen, was, as it still is, the plague and disgrace of the\r\ncommunity. Proclamations and ordinances of the severest character were\r\nleveled against it, but without appreciable effect. A few of the lesser\r\nculprits were caught, imprisoned, and in some cases flogged, but still\r\nthe illicit trade (before fully described) flourished, and this too\r\nalthough the laws had been rendered so stringent and complex as to prove\r\na trap for the innocent but unwary.\r\n\r\nOut of the confused state of these laws two _causes célebres_ arose,\r\nwhich excited much interest among the diggers and showed the continued\r\nlack of common sense displayed by the government in their policy and\r\nmodes of procedure. In the first instance an old digger, who had made\r\nhimself prominent in the prosecution of diamond thieves and had also\r\nmaterially assisted in the overthrow and subsequent recall of the\r\nSouthey-Currey faction, had in a moment of forgetfulness purchased a\r\nsmall diamond without having a dealer’s license and without being able\r\nto produce his special permit to the magistrate as by law required.\r\nThere was no pretence that the diamond had been stolen or improperly\r\nobtained, but nevertheless the unlucky purchaser of this “precious”\r\nstone was sentenced, if I remember rightly, to twelve months’\r\nimprisonment without the option of a fine. Granting, for the sake of\r\nargument, that the punishment was technically commensurate with the\r\noffense, the ardor exhibited by the authorities in the original pursuit\r\nof a political foe, to the minds of the independent diggers, was\r\nanything but satisfactory. That the man had no license to purchase\r\ndiamonds, and that his permit, if he ever had one, had been lost or\r\nmislaid was admitted, but when the prosecution sought to establish the\r\nfact of there having been no permit given by the production of a list\r\nkept in the Kimberley resident magistrate’s office, and manifestly a\r\nmost careless one, in which there was no mention of the name of the\r\naccused, his attorney very properly if not conclusively contended that\r\nthis evidence was not sufficiently formal upon which to found a\r\nconviction for a technical fault involving extremely severe punishment.\r\nHe argued moreover that if one magistrate’s list of permits was\r\nproduced, those of all other magistrates should be put in evidence also;\r\nthat the list in question might be imperfect, and as it was not in the\r\ncustody of the buyer, entries might have been confused, altered or\r\nannulled without his knowledge; in short that the rough list of a single\r\nmagistrate was not sufficient evidence on which so heavy a punishment\r\nought to be inflicted on any member of the body politic. A subordinate\r\nofficial, however, swore “by all his gods” that it was “impossible for a\r\npermit to have been issued to the prisoner without an entry having been\r\nmade in his record book,” and upon the strength of that evidence the\r\naccused was accordingly “cast into prison.” But observe the sequel. The\r\nink was scarcely dry upon the warrant which tore the unhappy culprit\r\nfrom his wife and family and confined him amidst the vilest criminals,\r\nwhen lo! a whisper went abroad that his excellency himself had also been\r\npurchasing diamonds without any license and without any record of the\r\nnecessary permit. What was the inference? Mindful of the positive manner\r\nin which the keeper of the records had gravely sworn to the\r\nimpossibility of any permits having been issued without an entry in the\r\nproper book, the editor of the _Independent_ newspaper, which had taken\r\nup a position of uncompromising hostility toward diamond thieves,\r\npublished in the public interest certain queries respecting the\r\nanomalous and unpleasant predicament in which the administrator might be\r\nplaced. There was no contention that he had been guilty of any _malum in\r\nse_ or of purchasing other than for his own private use and pleasure,\r\nbut merely of _malum prohibitum_. The Draconian severity of the law and\r\nthe apparent impropriety of the previous conviction was strikingly shown\r\nforth. The article was very aptly headed: “Where is this to end?” and at\r\nthe moment it was a question difficult to answer. The administrator,\r\nnevertheless, very promptly set about his reply, and took active steps\r\nagainst the bold editor who had dared to “come between the wind and his\r\nnobility.”\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to conjure up any entry in the record of permits, for\r\nthe book had been too carefully and publicly examined by hostile critics\r\nfor that; but hey! presto! in a very few hours after the newspaper\r\narticle had appeared, a notice said to have been inspired by the\r\ngovernment was publicly issued, in which it was triumphantly stated that\r\nthe versatile major was after all in possession of a permit which could\r\nbe inspected, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nUpon reading this the _cognoscenti_ winked knowingly at each other.\r\nAfter such an astonishing announcement it would only be thought\r\nreasonable that the administrator, upon finding so striking a\r\nconfirmation of the force of the argument of the prisoner’s attorney\r\nthat the record was not infallible, would have taken some immediate\r\nsteps toward a reconsideration and possible mitigation of a sentence\r\npassed under a harsh law.\r\n\r\nNo such thing happened, however. On the contrary, elated with the\r\nsuccessful experiment of “breaking a butterfly on the wheel” in the\r\nrecent prosecution, he at once caused the outspoken editor to be\r\narrested for a criminal libel upon “his excellency,” the accused being\r\ntemporarily liberated upon the modest bail of £6,000! which was at once\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nA preliminary examination before the magistrate followed, and the editor\r\nwas fully committed for trial. It would perhaps not be judicious to\r\nrefer too specifically to the adverse opinions which were entertained by\r\nan independent public with regard to this case. Lawyers have or used to\r\nhave a saying that “the greater the truth the greater the libel.”\r\nSuffice it to say that public comments were far from flattering to Major\r\nLanyon and the members of his executive.\r\n\r\nWhen the day of trial arrived excitement was raised to a very high\r\npitch. The court was crowded to overflowing, and large numbers of the\r\ndiggers were anxiously awaiting the result in the market square in front\r\nof the court-house. The administrator was located during the trial in a\r\nprivate room which adjoined the court, where a _dejeuner à la\r\nfourchette_ and subsequent refreshments were plenteously dispensed to\r\nsome chosen supporters of the existing state of things.\r\n\r\nThe judge wore his severest frown; the government officials hovered\r\nround the precincts of the court, and with bated breath awaited the\r\nverdict, which was to clear their chief’s character from the calumnious\r\nbreath of an audacious critic.\r\n\r\nBut the imprisoned editor saw no reason for apprehension. Fortunately\r\nfor him his case had to be decided not by a military dictator, nor yet\r\nby a single judge or magistrate, but by the sound common sense and fair\r\nplay of a jury. Mr. Shippard,[62] the acting attorney general, went\r\nheart and soul into the prosecution.\r\n\r\nIn a labored and somewhat silly harangue he recounted with much unction\r\nthe obsolete and barbarous customs of the old Roman emperors in dealing\r\nwith those whom they deemed guilty of seditious libel. As he gathered\r\ncourage during the delivery of his diatribe, he overcame the natural\r\nhesitancy of his speech and became even eloquent. It is true that the\r\nact which had been attributed to the major was one which, as it had been\r\ncontended for the defence in a previous case, did not amount to a\r\nmorally criminal charge, and should not be proved or provable by a mere\r\nloosely kept note-book, or punished by imprisonment without option of a\r\nfine; in fact not that the major was guilty, but that the other man was\r\nmorally if not legally innocent; further, it was urged that the whole\r\nmatter amounted at the most to a mere technical omission of a purely\r\nformal character, which might inadvertently be committed by any usually\r\nlaw-abiding citizen.\r\n\r\nBut the engineer did not like to “be hoist with his own petard,” and the\r\nattorney general, with “Gallio-like” unconcern for anything but his\r\n“Dryasdust” antiquities, snorted forth his anathemas against the\r\noffending editor. He introduced into his remarks a plentiful sprinkling\r\nof Roman archæology and referred with ludicrous solemnity to the old\r\nworld restrictions upon the freedom of public criticism. He spoke with\r\ngrave gusto of the good old times of the Emperor Zeno, when slanderous\r\naccusations against the “purple” were punishable with death. He must\r\nhave forgotten that in Zeno’s time offices of state were openly bought\r\nand sold, and life and death had their price.\r\n\r\nDid the honorable attorney general wish to apply the whole theory and\r\npractice of the old Roman criminal law to the affairs of our days of\r\nsteam power, telegraphs and independent press? It is difficult to say\r\nhow far some men will ride their hobbies.\r\n\r\nAfter he had done with Zeno’s time, however, he was compelled to admit\r\nthat capital punishment for the offense under consideration had been\r\n“mercifully commuted to a public flogging,” and seemed to imply that\r\nsome punishment of that nature would not be inapplicable to the case of\r\nthe editor who had spoken so severely of his patron. In this style he\r\npoured forth the vials of his wrath until the amazed crowd of listening\r\ndiggers were agape with astonishment at the righteous (and loudly\r\nexpressed) indignation of the prosecuting barrister. The audience might\r\nnot unreasonably have expected that the next authority to be quoted by\r\nthe excited counsel would be the customs and maxims of that “beauteous,\r\nimplacable tyrant,” the lamented Nero.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAn amusing incident occurred when the court rose for luncheon. The\r\neditor was of course a prisoner, the responsibility of his sureties\r\nwhile he was out on bail having ceased upon his appearing and pleading\r\nto the indictment, but the judge, who, it is only fair to state, treated\r\nhim with marked courtesy throughout the trial, permitted him to leave\r\nthe court _en parole_, as it were, for luncheon.\r\n\r\nWith the jury it was quite different. The acting attorney general did\r\nnot want to let them mix with the outside crowd who had already\r\nexpressed _their_ opinion of the proceedings pretty plainly, and\r\naccordingly at his instigation, or at least with his concurrence, the\r\nhapless jurors were locked up _sans ceremonie_ until after luncheon.\r\nNotwithstanding all the perverse ingenuity of the prosecuting counsel,\r\nhe could not persuade the jury to convict the prisoner. After a short\r\ndeliberation the jury returned a verdict of “not guilty” which was\r\nreceived with loud acclamations both inside and outside the court, the\r\ndelighted diggers carrying off the liberated editor on their shoulders\r\nto celebrate the victory in the “flowing bowl,” while the major,\r\naccompanied by his sympathizers, made a hurried exit from the back of\r\nthe court and went home a “sadder and a wiser man.”\r\n\r\nThe administrator, however, brought a civil action against the\r\nproprietors of the newspaper for libel, laying his damages at £10,000;\r\nbut after considerable skirmishing an apology was accepted, and so ended\r\na most disagreeable affair to all parties concerned.

G. BOTTOMLEY’S LIQUOR BILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore touching upon what I will term our local wars, that occurred\r\nduring Major Lanyon’s term of office, I will very shortly refer to the\r\nfourth Kafir war in which the Cape Colony was engaged, and this I do\r\nbecause the contingent the Diamond Fields sent to assist in this\r\ncampaign played a far from unimportant part.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak arose from a dispute between the Gealekas and their\r\nhereditary enemies, the Fingoes, the former looking with envy upon the\r\ntract of country across the Kei occupied by the latter, but which the\r\nformer had at one time possessed. The war arose from an affray at a beer\r\ndrinking bout in August 1877, the Gealekas attacking the Fingoes to\r\nrevenge the murder of one of their friends, which had been committed in\r\na scuffle at the feast which I have just mentioned. Directly after this,\r\nnumerous incursions began to be made by the Gealekas into Fingoland, and\r\nold colonists could easily see that war was imminent, when in September\r\nKreli could not be induced to meet Sir Bartle Frere, who at that time\r\nhappened to be on the frontier.\r\n\r\nToward the latter end of the above-named year, the chiefs Kreli and\r\nSandilli massed their followings in open rebellion against the\r\ngovernment. Corps of volunteers were raised, and with the regiments of\r\nregulars in the Colony were marched against the savage hordes of the\r\nKafir chiefs, under the control of General Thesiger, afterward Lord\r\nChelmsford. The turn of the year came and no material change in the\r\nstate of affairs had taken place. The Gaikas and the Gealekas were\r\ngradually creeping toward a fastness known as the Perie Bush. This bush\r\nis in reality a forest, in length some thirty miles and in width varying\r\nfrom two to seven, and terminating to the northwest in the Amatola\r\nmountains, an almost impassable range, contiguous to the old frontier\r\ntown of Fort Beaufort. In consequence of the vast area to be covered by\r\nthe troops, it was impossible to prevent the natives and their cattle in\r\nobtaining entrance into the bush.\r\n\r\nOnce there, they thought that they had an immunity from danger, for on\r\nthe top of the range a vast plateau extends, where they might obtain\r\nluxuriant pasturage for their cattle and cool, refreshing springs of\r\nwater for themselves. It almost appeared, as the first moon of 1878 rose\r\nupon that portion of the Colony, that the guerilla warfare would be\r\ninterminable, and a cry for help was raised through the Colony, which\r\nreached the province of Griqualand West. One hundred and twenty of our\r\nyoung bloods volunteered for service five hundred miles away, and with\r\nthat military ardor which characterizes all colonists, they slung their\r\nguns across their shoulders, sprang into the saddle, and were at once\r\nready for the toilsome, dusty, wearisome journey by road to King\r\nWilliam’s Town, for those were the days of no railways. Colonel Warren,\r\nnow Sir Charles Warren, the chief commissioner of the metropolitan\r\npolice, was their trusted leader. The force, though small, was plucky\r\nand inured to hardships, just the right stuff to fight the wily savage,\r\nwhilst their commander was highly popular with his men. It was on Jan.\r\n10th, 1878, that this compact band started from the Diamond Fields, and\r\na fine sight it was when Colonel Lanyon, the administrator, made them a\r\nparting address at Du Toit’s Pan in the presence of at least 3,000, who\r\nhad assembled to wish “our boys” “God speed.”\r\n\r\nMarching some forty miles a day under a “sky of molten brass,” they\r\narrived in King William’s Town on the 25th of the same month. At that\r\ntime the chief Sandilli was on the move, so the Diamond Fields horse\r\nwere stationed about fifty miles out of King William’s Town in\r\nconjunction with the hapless 24th, afterward annihilated at Isandhlwana\r\nduring the now historical Zulu campaign. Patroling the country around\r\nwas their main duty for some six weeks, during which time, although the\r\ncommissariat department was fairly well attended to, much hardship was\r\nendured by reason of the daily rains and the inadequate tent provision\r\nsupplied by the colonial government. Strange to say, little sickness was\r\nengendered, nor did the hardy fellows suffer subsequently from their\r\nexposure. The rebels having in the meantime congregated in the Perie\r\nBush, an order was issued for the Diamond Fields horse to repair\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture the Pondoland difficulties were drawing to a\r\ncrisis, and when the Hon. Mr. Lyttleton was deputed to go to Kokstadt,\r\nit was thought the little force under Colonel Warren would be ordered to\r\nescort him.\r\n\r\nIt turned out otherwise; the Diamond Fields horse was required for\r\naction, and all the men were delighted. They had not, they urged, come\r\ndown country for escort duty, but to show their qualities as fighting\r\nmen. At all events they had not long to wait, for after a short period\r\nof duty in the dense demesne of the Perie Bush a brush with the enemy\r\ntook place. Such was the thick and jungle-like nature of the underwood,\r\nand such the natural advantages of the position which the enemy had\r\nchosen, that two officers of the corps, Captain Donovan and Lieutenant\r\nWard, a gallant young fellow, well known in Kimberley, were shot by the\r\nsavage horde, and there was no chance at that moment for their comrades\r\nto avenge their death. The little force bided its time. In a few days it\r\nwas reported to Colonel Warren that a vast body of the enemy, advancing\r\non foot, according to Kafir custom, in battalions, and headed by petty\r\nchiefs on horseback, were making for the Perie Bush. This was at an\r\noutlying station known as Debe Nek, midway between King William’s Town\r\nand Fort Beaufort, and in sight of the fastness wherein they believed\r\ntheir safety would be assured.\r\n\r\nThe Diamond Fields horse (increased at this time by colonial recruits)\r\nwas detached, but yet there were fifty-seven men of the original corps\r\nwho volunteered to go out to meet the enemy. The latter was estimated at\r\n1,500, or in other words the odds were twenty-five to one against our\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThey came on, one huge phalanx, singing their war songs, and fired with\r\nan enthusiasm peculiar to the Kafir race. Taking in the situation at\r\nonce Colonel Warren ordered his men to dismount and secure the\r\nprotection of a wide sluit running to the left of the Fort Beaufort\r\nroad. Telling off three or four to hold the horses, and holding fully a\r\ndozen himself, he ordered the men to commence firing, and many of the\r\nenemy fell, but, as the front row dropped, on came the vast mass behind.\r\n\r\nAs our brave fellows peppered away with the skill of sharp-shooters some\r\nseventy of the savage horde were laid low, and then dismay seized the\r\nremainder. From the advantageous position selected by Colonel Warren it\r\nwas impossible for the enemy to know the strength of its opponents.\r\nConsternation, as I have said, seized the sable host, and like\r\nSennacherib’s army they melted away even as snow, not, however, before\r\nseveral of the Diamond Fields horse got into hand-to-hand combat with\r\nthem. Although the slaughter was great on the side of the rebels, yet of\r\nthe little force under Colonel Warren only one man was wounded, who\r\nthrough his own neglect afterward succumbed. The news of this gallant\r\ndefence filled the inhabitants of the Diamond Fields with exultation.\r\nCongratulations were telegraphed down to Colonel Warren and his men,\r\nwhile the friends of the brave band under him were highly delighted. The\r\nback of the rebellion had been virtually broken. The news spread, as\r\nnews only can spread among Kafir tribes, and Colonel Warren was looked\r\nupon by the Kafirs as possessed of supernatural powers. It only required\r\ntact to complete the subjugation of the rebels, and the leader was not\r\nlacking in this quality. It had been known that the women folk of the\r\nKafir tribes intrenched within the Perie Bush were habitually allowed\r\nfree ingress and egress. This they made use of for the purpose of\r\nbringing supplies from King William’s Town.\r\n\r\nReporting this fact to the late Sir Bartle Frere, the then governor of\r\nthe colony, Colonel Warren was advised to communicate with General\r\nThesiger. That red-tape entangled officer, however, deigned no reply,\r\nand seeing the waste of public treasure involved by General Thesiger’s\r\nindifference, Colonel Warren decided to act, knowing full well, if\r\nsuccessful, that he would have the full support of Sir Bartle Frere.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity of carrying out his plan quickly offered itself. Out of\r\nthe Perie Bush, seeking supplies, and almost in a starving condition,\r\ncame 600 women and children. Surrounded and made prisoners by the\r\nDiamond Fields horse they were fed and taken into King William’s Town\r\nand there handed over to the civil authorities, to be afterward sent to\r\nCapetown and apprenticed as domestic servants.\r\n\r\nThe husbands and fathers, rather than that those they held most dear\r\nshould be separated from them, possibly for ever, appealed to the\r\nchiefs, some of whom perhaps were sufferers from Colonel Warren’s _coup\r\nde main_, and so ended the Gaika-Gealika rebellion.\r\n\r\nThis sudden termination to the war, however, I believe was also the\r\ntermination in the friendship previously existing between General\r\nThesiger and Colonel Warren.\r\n\r\nAbout this time bad news was received from the northern border of\r\nGriqualand West. Bolasike Gasibone, it was reported, was committing acts\r\nof plunder and generally exhibiting a total disregard of the laws of\r\n_meum_ and _tuum_, and in consequence Major Lanyon, the administrator of\r\nthe province, left on January 21st, 1878, with 150 volunteers for\r\nPhokwane to punish him. The major was absent from Kimberley some twelve\r\ndays, found that there had been no fighting, found no one with whom to\r\nfight, merely old women, children and cows; he collared the cows, and\r\nreturned with the spoil to the diamond fields. Many laughed at the whole\r\naffair, but a more serious view was afterward presented for\r\nconsideration when the Revs. Messrs. Bevan and Ashton, two well-known\r\nmissionaries, appealed to the public for assistance for the poor\r\nnatives, who, they stated, were starving. Major Lanyon to stay public\r\nindignation sent a so-called independent commission to report on the\r\nstate of affairs, consisting of Mr. Lord, acting attorney general, a\r\nsubmissive admirer of every act of government, and Mr. Baillie, merely a\r\nsubordinate in the survey department. The report framed was of almost\r\ninterminable length, occupying fifteen pages in the government _Gazette_\r\nof March 16th, but before it was issued the public had openly expressed\r\ntheir anticipations respecting the document. The public was not,\r\nhowever, prepared for its “highfalutin” rhapsodies on the “duty of man,”\r\nnor for the strange citing of Holy Writ in its concluding sentence, in\r\nwhich natives, owners of the soil and living an independent pastoral\r\nlife, were told, after all their cattle had been forcibly removed, “if\r\nany man will not work neither shall he eat.”\r\n\r\nTwo months later (April 13th, 1878), the administrator of the Transvaal\r\nsolicited assistance against Sekukuni, and as preparations were being\r\nmade to give him assistance news arrived of trouble on our southwestern\r\nborder, which was confirmed by a dispatch on April 21st from Mr. H. B.\r\nRoper, the magistrate of Griqua Town. A call to arms was at once made\r\nand readily responded to. Major Lanyon again left Kimberley, in three\r\ndays’ time, with 100 men for Koejas. As soon as he arrived at his\r\ndestination he called upon the natives to put down their arms, which\r\nthey refused to do, and as they occupied a position from which it was\r\nimpossible to dislodge them without cannon, Major Maxwell was\r\ntelegraphed to at King William’s Town to at once bring up some\r\nfield-pieces. In the meantime volunteers were leaving Kimberley almost\r\nevery day for the front to strengthen Major Lanyon.\r\n\r\nDuring Major Lanyon’s encampment at Koejas the Griquas, who had up to\r\nthat time remained quiet (the rebellion having broken out among a number\r\nof colonial Kafirs and Korannas living on the banks of the Orange\r\nRiver), rose _en masse_ and besieged Griqua Town, which was surrounded\r\nby them for eight days. On the night of the eighth day Major Lanyon rode\r\nthrough them with twenty men undiscovered and joined some 100 volunteers\r\nwho had managed, the same day, to get into Griqua Town from the\r\nKimberley side. On the following day the rebels were completely routed\r\nat Driefontein in a decisive engagement which lasted twelve hours and\r\ndriven into their fastnesses in the Langeberg. Major Maxwell, whose\r\narrival was eagerly looked for, arrived at Koejas on May 25th with the\r\ncannon, just in the nick of time, as on the 31st 600 natives attacked\r\nthe camp, when the guns which he had brought up materially assisted to\r\nsecure the success of the day. During the time all these events had been\r\noccurring Colonel Warren and “our boys” had been burning to respond to\r\nthe calls for assistance which had reached them from Griqualand West.\r\nThey had heard how volunteers had been raised and had taken the field\r\nunder the command of the administrator, and how the country on the\r\nsouthwestern border was in a state of tumult and insurrection. Springing\r\nto saddle the plucky band made forced marches, this time in the cold,\r\npinching month of May. “The air bit shrewdly and ’twas bitter cold,” but\r\nwith no covering save a blanket and the saddle for a pillow, they\r\nquickly reached the junction of the Vaal and Orange Rivers. Scarcely had\r\nthe force (numbering then about 200 men) crossed the Vaal River than\r\nColonel Warren scented the disaffected Griquas at Wittehuis, where they\r\nhad “enschanged” themselves in a formidable position between the Kaap\r\nRange and the Vaal River. Here the rebels were attacked and routed, and\r\nafter completing their defeat Colonel Warren and his men pushed on to\r\nGriqua Town.\r\n\r\nThence he and Major Lanyon proceeded to the Langeberg, where several\r\nengagements took place, in all of which the rebels were defeated. The\r\nmost important of these skirmishes was that of Paarde-Kloop, at which an\r\nimmense quantity of wagons, oxen, horses and sheep were captured. There\r\nis nothing which makes a native regret rebellion more than the loss of\r\nhis worldly goods. Capture his stock and he is defeated.\r\n\r\nAfter these engagements the administrator returned to Griqua Town,\r\nleaving Colonel Warren in command, and there received the sad\r\nintelligence of the skirmish at Manyeering, resulting in the death of\r\nMessrs. Paterson, Rawstorne and several other well-known persons. While\r\nproceeding as quickly as possible on his road to Kimberley, he was\r\nattacked by and succeeded in defeating a body of rebels at Campbell,\r\nsome thirty miles from Kimberley, where he arrived in safety after being\r\nsome two months absent from the seat of government.\r\n\r\nColonel Warren now made a detour, suspecting the enemy to be lodged in a\r\nmountain situated to the northeast, and distant from the Griqua Town\r\nroad some twenty miles. Here he only found groups of chattering monkeys,\r\ninstead of the Griquas he expected.\r\n\r\nThe rebels had fled!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TAIKOON PASS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter remaining a few days in Kimberley to settle some urgent matters\r\nconnected with the government, Major Lanyon proceeded to Bechuanaland,\r\nwhere he was joined by Colonel Warren, and where after the battle of\r\nTaikoon and other smart engagements the rebellion was finally crushed.\r\n\r\nI may here say that the rebellion among the natives who were once, it\r\nmust be kept in mind, the owners of the soil, arose with the white man\r\nfrom difficulties mainly respecting land, and from the dissatisfaction\r\ngenerally felt by a large proportion of them with Colonel Warren’s\r\nprevious decisions in this regard, which had driven them to utter\r\ndespair; for it was not until entreaties and even tears had failed to\r\nhave any effect that they resorted to rebellion. Colonel Warren was by\r\nnature hasty beyond description, autocratic to a degree, and bigoted in\r\nthe extreme.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the natives had been treated both by Stockenstrom in\r\nthe land court and afterward by Warren was freely commented upon by\r\ncolonial statesmen. Mr. R. Southey, formerly lieutenant governor of\r\nGriqualand West, gave utterance to the following significant words in\r\nthe Cape house of assembly, when speaking on the subject: “So gross was\r\nthe injustice sustained by these people in the land court that had I\r\nbeen a Griqua, I too would have rebelled.”\r\n\r\nMr. H. B. Roper, now chief of the detective department and police\r\ncommissioner of Kimberley, then the resident magistrate of Hay, was\r\naccused in an official dispatch by Colonel Warren of having been the\r\nsole cause of this war through his magisterial judgments, and every\r\nendeavor was made by interested officials to throw the entire blame of\r\nthe war upon him. This official’s record books were subjected to the\r\nprivate scrutiny of the attorney general by the magistrate who succeeded\r\nhim, who by this means wished to curry favor with the powers that used\r\nto be, but, although his sentences were found to be decidedly severe,\r\nthey showed no taint of what could be construed into injustice, and the\r\nsinister scheme with respect to him fell through.\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Warren became acting administrator of Griqualand West, he\r\npublished in the government _Gazette_ the names of a commission which\r\nwas to sit at various places and inquire into the causes of the war, but\r\nit never sat once.\r\n\r\nAnd why?\r\n\r\nBecause it was found to be indubitably certain that the answer to every\r\nquestion as to the cause of the rebellion would be “land.”\r\n\r\nIn the month of August, 1878, all the volunteers, including “our boys,”\r\nreturned to Kimberley, the latter having been more than nine months in\r\nthe field, when the proceeds of the prizes captured throughout the\r\ncampaign were equally distributed among them.\r\n\r\nThe reception given to the volunteers by the Kimberley people and the\r\ninhabitants of the Diamond Fields generally was most cordial and\r\nenthusiastic, reviews, balls and dinners being the order of the day.\r\n\r\nAs a _resumé_ of the events of the war, I may here state there had been\r\nduring the campaign fully twenty engagements, attended with considerable\r\nslaughter in the rebel ranks, from whom vast herds of cattle and\r\nnumberless wagons were captured, while on the side of the volunteers the\r\naverage loss amounted to little more than one man per engagement.\r\n\r\nThe rebellion brought attendant miseries in its train. The prisoners,\r\nincluding old men, women and children, were removed to Kimberley as soon\r\nas captured, and miserable objects they were.\r\n\r\nIn piercing cold weather, it being the middle of winter, with scarcely a\r\nstitch of clothes to their backs, they were sent up in wagon-loads, and\r\npenned like so many sheep in a yard adjoining the jail. In all they\r\nnumbered some 700. During their confinement, extending over some fifty\r\ndays, at the rate of three a day more than one-fifth died, and the\r\nsurvivors were exposed to public gaze in order that the townspeople\r\nmight select those whom they chose for domestic service. The ravages of\r\nsyphilis among these Griquas were perfectly astounding, scarcely a man,\r\nwoman or child being free from its secondary effects. These prisoners of\r\nwar, virtually slaves, soon one by one made their escape to their homes,\r\nand the government very wisely, on peace being proclaimed, did not\r\nenforce the terms of their apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the victory achieved by our arms, native\r\ndisturbances were not altogether finished. Shadows of a disturbance\r\namong the Korannas at the Salt Pan, near Christiana, darkening the air,\r\nColonel Warren thought it better to nip any rising among these people in\r\nthe bud. In this case there was “much ado about nothing.” The _émeute_\r\ncommenced through a difference of opinion between a Koranna and a Dutch\r\nfarmer concerning a cow, in which a German missionary took the part of\r\nthe native.\r\n\r\nThe affair was so much magnified that Colonel Warren went up to\r\nChristiana accompanied by volunteers in January 1879, and sent for\r\nHermanus Lynx, the captain of the tribe, and the German missionary to\r\ncome before him. After inquiring into the affair Colonel Warren deemed\r\nit sufficient to put the missionary on his _parole d’honneur_, which\r\nparole the German missionary incontinently broke.\r\n\r\nIt then was deemed necessary to take more decisive steps, and a body of\r\nmen were next day sent to the Salt Pan to arrest the “reverend” violator\r\nof the first law of honor, which was done, and he was brought back to\r\nChristiana, not, however, without the loss of one of the volunteers, who\r\nwas killed by the accidental discharge of a gun by a Koranna.\r\n\r\nAfter this all became quiet and the volunteers returned to Kimberley.\r\nThe whole of the affair was much exaggerated, two men could just as\r\nsatisfactorily have arranged the dispute between the Koranna and the\r\nDutchman as two hundred.\r\n\r\nHermanus Lynx, the unfortunate captain of the Korannas, was confined for\r\nmonths a prisoner in the Kimberley jail, and Major Maxwell, the\r\ninspector of prisons, was compelled to state, when as vice-president of\r\nthe legislative council I called for the papers in the case, “I have no\r\nwarrant for his detention nor papers of any kind.” In a written\r\nstatement which Hermanus Lynx afterward made, he imploringly said: “I\r\nwant to know what I have done to merit my having been kept in prison for\r\nthe past eight months. I have not committed theft nor killed any\r\nperson.... I am not afraid.” As I have before mentioned I brought this\r\npoor fellow’s case before the council by asking the simple question:\r\n“For what crime and under what warrant is Hermanus Lynx confined a\r\nprisoner in the Kimberley jail?”\r\n\r\nThe illegality, the cruelty, with which this unfortunate chief had been\r\ntreated would not bear exposure, consequently before the day came round\r\non which my question must have been answered by the government Hermanus\r\nLynx was a free man. This act of simple justice came too late to repair\r\nthe injury done him. The government on his liberation supplied him with\r\na tent, wagon and rations, but within a week he died on the banks of the\r\nVaal River, ruined and heart-broken, having covered only twenty-five\r\nmiles of his homeward journey.\r\n\r\nSince the events chronicled in this chapter there has been no further\r\ndisturbance among the natives in the country districts of Griqualand,\r\nfor the possibly very excellent reason that there are no independent\r\nnatives left.\r\n\r\nAbout this time my colleague, Mr. George Bottomley, introduced an act\r\ninto the legislative council amending the liquor laws of the province,\r\nwhich was much needed,[64] and I fathered a private bill authorizing the\r\nsupply of Kimberley with water from the Vaal River; but with the\r\nexception of continued progressive diamond legislation (which has been\r\nelsewhere fully detailed) nothing further of particular moment came\r\nbefore the council that session.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n      COLONEL WARREN AND MR.

G., LAST ACTING ADMINISTRATOR.—ELECTION FOR CAPE HOUSE\r\n                              OF ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Colonel Lanyon was sent by the imperial government to the\r\nTransvaal, Colonel (now Sir Charles) Warren was appointed acting\r\nadministrator in Feb. 1879. His short “acting” career was characterized\r\nby procedures, which, if not strictly illegal, yet exhibited a great\r\namount of impulsive self-will, which many times carried him a little too\r\nfar. This was especially marked in his treatment of Mr. Advocate Lord,\r\nQ. C., the attorney general, which created for that gentleman, at the\r\ntime, an immense amount of sympathy; Sir Bartle Frere, after he had\r\nfully studied both sides of the question, absolutely canceling the order\r\nsuspending Mr. Lord from office, which he had made at the suggestion of\r\nthe acting administrator. Such actions, however, caused less surprise\r\nwhen it was reported that Colonel Warren was also suffering from the\r\neffects of an accident, met with I believe, in the Perie Bush; but of\r\nthis the public was not long kept in suspense, as a climax was reached\r\nin October of the same year, when the acting administrator had suddenly\r\nto leave the province, in the care of the government surgeon.\r\n\r\nGriqualand West was then blessed (or cursed) with another acting\r\nadministrator in the person of Mr. Justice de Wet (now Sir Jacobus), who\r\nadministered the government until the arrival of his successor, Mr. Rose\r\nInnes, C. M. G., who in reality came like an assignee’s agent to wind up\r\nan estate, or in other words to prepare the territory for annexation.\r\n\r\nTo return to the visit of Messrs. Sprigg and Upington. As these\r\ngentlemen occupied the positions of premier and attorney general of the\r\nCape Colony respectively, great importance was attached to their visit,\r\nas the conjecture was generally entertained that they had come to “spy\r\nout the land.” At a public dinner given them, these gentlemen gave forth\r\nwhat the inhabitants of the diamond fields thought no uncertain sound.\r\n\r\nMr. Sprigg, in his speech on the occasion, said: “That in the year 1878\r\nthe annexation act was returned with her Majesty’s assent, and it was\r\nsignified to the governor of the colony that he was at liberty to put\r\nthat annexation in force. The governor asked my advice on the matter,\r\nand I informed the governor of the Cape Colony and the governor of the\r\nprovince, when he was present himself, that I could not at that time\r\nadvise that the act should be put in force, because I felt extreme\r\nunwillingness to annex any province to the Cape Colony against the\r\nwishes of the inhabitants;” while Mr. Upington was even more decided in\r\nhis remarks, saying that: “He had seen it stated that his honorable\r\nfriend and himself had come to Griqualand West with a view of doing\r\nsomething which, in the minds of some people at least, would be an\r\ninjury to this province. He wished to give an emphatic denial to this\r\nstatement.... They would seek to deal with the people of this province\r\non the broad grounds of reason.... If they had intended to do anything\r\nagainst the wishes of the people why should they not have done it by a\r\nstroke of the pen in April 1878, or at any time down to the present\r\nday?... They had come to see the people and their representatives, to\r\nendeavor to come to a conclusion as to what would be the best for South\r\nAfrica generally.” These utterances attracted much attention, but yet it\r\nwas considered advisable to hold a public meeting and send a deputation\r\nto wait on Messrs. Sprigg and Upington. A meeting of 1,000 citizens was\r\nheld in the Theatre Royal on Oct. 6th, 1879, when ten gentlemen,\r\nincluding the members of council, were chosen to form a deputation to\r\nwait on the above-named Cape ministers, but, as one of these, I came\r\naway as wise, after the interview, as before.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Kimberley were, however, lulled into a sense of false\r\nsecurity, in which they remained until Sir Bartle Frere electrified them\r\nby an unmistakable statement respecting annexation in his speech at the\r\nopening of the Cape assembly in 1880. In this speech he said: “In\r\nredemption of the undertaking given by the colonial legislature and\r\nconfirmed by the colonial governor, we relieve her Majesty’s government\r\nof the responsibility of the administration of the affairs of Griqualand\r\nWest. The bill passed for that purpose in 1879 will shortly be\r\nproclaimed, care being taken that the people of that important province\r\nshall not be left without legislation, at a time when a legislature in\r\nwhich they are not at present represented is actually in session.” What\r\ncould be done? Remonstrances, petitions, public meetings, all had been\r\ntried and found to be of no avail. The elective members of the\r\nlegislative council then made a move, and as a body supported a motion\r\nwhich I brought forward in June 1880, seconded by the member for Barkly,\r\nMr. Paddon, to the effect “that in the opinion of this council the\r\nannexation by proclamation or otherwise of the province of Griqualand\r\nWest to the Cape Colony would be detrimental to the best interests of\r\nthe province, and opposed to the wishes of the inhabitants.” In a long\r\nand exhaustive speech I went through all the reasons against annexation,\r\nspeeches to the same effect being made by the other elective members,\r\nwhen the attorney general, who no doubt had infinitely more respect at\r\nthis time for the magnates of the Cape Colony than he had in 1884, when\r\nby bitter experience he found that it was vain to trust in “premiers,”\r\nproposed an amendment: “That in the absence of any public expression of\r\nopinion on the subject it is premature and unreasonable to ask this\r\ncouncil to commit itself to the terms of the resolution, which is based\r\nupon the assumption that such opinion has been expressed,” and this was\r\nseconded by the treasurer general. On my calling for a division the\r\npresident put the amendment—the president, the recorder, the attorney\r\ngeneral, the treasurer general, in a word all the members of the\r\ngovernment, voting for the amendment, and the elective members against,\r\nwhen the president, as a nominee of the Cape ministry, sent for a\r\nspecial object, exercised his right and gave the casting vote, which, of\r\ncourse, was in favor of the amendment, and against my motion—being “in\r\nkeeping,” he said, “with the speech I considered it my _duty_ to make.”\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this a large meeting was held in the Theatre Royal, at\r\nwhich a resolution was passed approving of the action of the elective\r\nmembers, and thanking them for opposing the measure.\r\n\r\nThe position, however, was soon realized by many: That _nolentes aut\r\nvolentes_ we were to be cast off by the imperial government and absorbed\r\ninto the unsympathetic Cape Colony; and perceiving that further\r\nopposition was useless, the inhabitants quietly accepted the inevitable,\r\nwith the exception of a few stubborn spirits, myself among the number.\r\nSept. 30th, 1880, the day on which was to be sounded the death-note of\r\nthe autonomy of the province, at last arrived. The council met at the\r\nusual hour in the afternoon, but it could at once be seen that some\r\nunusual occurrence was expected. The acting administrator of the\r\nterritory and president of the council, Mr. Rose Innes, C. M. G., sat at\r\nthe head of the table, looking very solemn, while _vis-à-vis_ at the\r\nfoot I sat, supported by the members for Barkly and Hay. No member,\r\neither elective or non-elective, was absent. There was no vacant seat\r\nthat day. The hall was crowded, many ladies coming to see the closing\r\nact of the drama which had for the last six years been produced under\r\ndifferent managers in the small theatre of Griqualand West.\r\n\r\nAfter prayers, the usual formal questions having been asked, I at once\r\nrose and read the accompanying protest against annexation:\r\n\r\n  “We, the undersigned, elective members for the Province of Griqualand\r\n  West, having ascertained that it is in contemplation to enforce at an\r\n  early date an act, No. 39, of 1877, entitled “To make Provision for\r\n  the Annexation in this Colony, of the Province of Griqualand West,”\r\n  hereby desire our protest against the same to be recorded on the\r\n  minutes of this council previous to its dissolution, for the following\r\n  reasons:\r\n\r\n  “1st. Because it was understood at the time the act was under\r\n  discussion in the Cape parliament that it would be submitted to the\r\n  legislative council of this province before any attempt would be made\r\n  to promulgate it; Whereas this has not been done, neither have the\r\n  wishes of the inhabitants of Griqualand West in any way been\r\n  regarded—whether in respect to the expediency of annexation or the\r\n  conditions upon which it should take place.\r\n\r\n  “2d. Because the measure of representation accorded under the act to\r\n  the electoral divisions of the province is, we submit, in no way\r\n  commensurate with its wealth, and with the intelligence and enterprise\r\n  of its inhabitants, and judging from the past we have little hope in\r\n  this respect of reasonable treatment in future at the hands of a Cape\r\n  parliament.\r\n\r\n  “3d. Because the circumstances of this province differing entirely\r\n  from those of the Cape Colony, demand the presence of a local\r\n  government, with authority to deal at once with mining and other\r\n  questions requiring immediate attention; consequently we anticipate\r\n  that great injury will be done this province by the seat of government\r\n  being removed so many hundred miles away.\r\n\r\n  “4th. Because the inhabitants of this province object to being mixed\r\n  up in the party contentions of the Cape Colony, where the scramble for\r\n  place and power seems to override all other considerations and to\r\n  retard that progress which would otherwise ensue.\r\n\r\n  “5th. Because Her Majesty’s subjects in Griqualand West have in no way\r\n  forfeited their right to be consulted as to the disposition of this\r\n  province or the alteration of their political status; but, on the\r\n  contrary, have shown their fitness for self-government by defending\r\n  their country and even in assisting neighboring provinces during the\r\n  late general war with the native tribes.\r\n\r\n  “6th. Because, although the people of this province are undoubtedly\r\n  loyal to the Queen’s government, yet they do most strongly object to\r\n  the action of the imperial authorities in thus handing them over to a\r\n  government and a colony with which they have so little in common; and\r\n  we, in our own name and in the names of our constituents, hereby hold\r\n  both the imperial and colonial governments responsible for all\r\n  untoward events and results which may follow on annexation.\r\n\r\n  “Therefore, for these above stated and other weighty reasons, we\r\n  hereby request that this, our protest against the annexation of this\r\n  province to the Cape Colony, may be recorded on the minutes of this\r\n  council, and that a copy of the same may be forthwith forwarded to the\r\n  colonial government and the secretary of state for the colonies.\r\n\r\n  “(Signed)\r\n\r\n                                                   J. W. MATTHEWS, V. P.\r\n                                                   G. BOTTOMLEY.\r\n                                                   I. PADDON.\r\n                                                   H. GREEN.”\r\n\r\nThen, as vice-president, I spoke against the measure and said, as\r\nreported in the local journals:\r\n\r\n  “In asking that this protest may be recorded on the minutes of the\r\n  council, I may say I do so with a heavy heart, and that I find it\r\n  difficult to restrain my feelings. It would seem that in the\r\n  arrangements of this annexation all consideration for the welfare of\r\n  this province has been overlooked. It was not so when Sir Henry Barkly\r\n  was governor; he deprecated in the most emphatic manner possible the\r\n  idea of governing this province from Capetown. Again, when Messrs.\r\n  Sprigg and Upington were here recently, they saw, as Sir Henry Barkly\r\n  had seen, the absurdity of such an idea, and in everything they said,\r\n  both in private and public, they repudiated the suggestion of annexing\r\n  this province to the Cape Colony. Mr. Upington was especially emphatic\r\n  in his condemnation of such a policy. Is it not then a great outrage\r\n  that in spite of all these protestations on the part of the Cape\r\n  government we should be taken over without being consulted? It may be\r\n  remembered that a public meeting which was called here to express\r\n  sympathy with Sir Bartle Frere in connection with Zululand matters was\r\n  very thinly attended, the people here showing by this their opinion of\r\n  Sir B. Frere’s treatment of this province, and what they thought of\r\n  the manner in which the petitions against annexation, emanating not\r\n  only from the monied classes but also from the bone and sinew of the\r\n  place, had been pigeon-holed and suppressed. There is no more right,\r\n  there is no more reason, for us to be annexed to the Cape Colony\r\n  to-day than there would be for Natal to be annexed to-morrow, which\r\n  colony is simply nowhere in wealth and public enterprise as compared\r\n  with this. [Loud applause.] We differ from Natal in many respects. I\r\n  may remind you of one: when we were in danger, we defended ourselves\r\n  with our own troops, and did not cry out for imperial assistance, we\r\n  actually sent volunteers away to help the Cape Colony in its\r\n  difficulties with Kreli and Sandilli, and are even now being called\r\n  upon to assist in quelling a rebellion in Basutoland, the result of\r\n  the latest blunder of the Cape ministry. [Hear, hear.]\r\n\r\n  “Some think that annexation will bring relief from the grievances\r\n  under which we labor, but when they have to pay a tax on diamonds,\r\n  have no administrator at hand to personally inspect and redress their\r\n  complaints [hear, hear], what then?\r\n\r\n  “We may get a railway, but that is no certainty; we may get the\r\n  advantage of a three-judge court, but these benefits are nothing in\r\n  comparison to what we shall lose, when we lose our independence. For\r\n  my part, I feel like a man who is unjustly charged with the commission\r\n  of a crime. I feel like a man who has been wrongly convicted, but the\r\n  jury have given their verdict and it remains with you, sir, as judge\r\n  to-day to pass the sentence. As the mouthpiece of the law you must do\r\n  its behests, but I protest against the passing of a sentence of\r\n  capital punishment. [Loud applause.]\r\n\r\n  “So far as the elected members of this council are concerned they have\r\n  done their duty to their constituents, they have resisted and\r\n  protested to the best of their ability against annexation to the Cape\r\n  Colony. I hope, however, sir, we shall soon recover our liberty under\r\n  a wide scheme of confederation. I bow now to the inevitable.\r\n  [Continued applause.]”\r\n\r\nMessrs. Bottomley and Paddon, the junior member for Kimberley, and the\r\nmember for Barkly, then also supported the protest which I had read, in\r\nshort speeches, when Mr. Rose Innes, as if tired of the play, spoke the\r\n“tag” declaring the council dissolved, and the curtain dropped.\r\n\r\nThus was carried into effect the bill which three years before had\r\npassed the Cape assembly (No. 39, 1877), and which had nearly lapsed\r\nthrough effluxion of time. It was forced on with most unseemly haste at\r\nthe finish, the provision in the 32d clause that the bill was to take\r\neffect when “all matters and things necessary to be done and to happen\r\nin order to enable the said annexation to be completed and perfected,\r\nhave been done and happened,” being entirely ignored, the boundary line\r\nof the province, the most important “matter and thing” of all, not\r\nhaving been definitely settled.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were taken over with all our liabilities and engagements, I\r\nam sorry to say repudiation has been, more or less, the favorite policy\r\nof the Cape government, so far as the “milch cow” of the colony is\r\nconcerned.[65]\r\n\r\nMr. Rose Innes, C. M. G., having finished his work, left for Capetown,\r\nand Mr. P. A. Villiers, the acting colonial secretary, with all the\r\npublic documents, title deeds and archives of the province soon followed\r\nin his wake, when instead of being a crown colony, with our own\r\ngovernor, and in direct communion with the imperial government, we found\r\nourselves a portion of the colony of the Cape of Good Hope, and at the\r\nbidding of its responsible advisers!\r\n\r\nGriqualand West was annexed to the Cape Colony in October 1880.\r\n\r\nIt was not until March 15th of the next year that an election took place\r\nfor the return of two members to represent Kimberley in the Cape\r\nparliament. There were three candidates for the two seats. Mr. J. B.\r\nRobinson, Mr. George Bottomley, my former colleague, and myself. The\r\nexcitement was most intense. The unlimited expenditure of money by the\r\none, and the pertinacious sectarian adherents of the other, proved a\r\nformidable opposition, but the all-round support given the “red, white\r\nand blue” enabled me a second time to become the senior member for\r\nKimberley. This election took place when the share mania was at its\r\nheight, when money was very plentiful, and no ordinance being in\r\nexistence forbidding brass bands, carriages, flags, rosettes, champagne\r\nand other little luxuries indulged in at such a time, the extravagant\r\nexpenditure bore favorable (?) contrast with an English election in the\r\n“good old days.” As may well be imagined in a rich digging community\r\nsome sharp practice occurred, but this was nothing in comparison with\r\nthat which took place when the seat, which I afterward vacated, was\r\nfilled up, for then the grave gave up her dead, the Capetown breakwater\r\nits convicts, and the natives “polled early and often” for the\r\nsuccessful candidate!\r\n\r\nThe assembly was in session when Mr. J. B. Robinson and myself arrived\r\nin Capetown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n        NATAL AGAIN.—COOLIE IMMIGRATION.—BISHOP COLENSO.—LAING’S\r\n  NEK.—INGOGO.—MAJUBA.—INTERESTING INTERVIEW WITH GENERALS JOUBERT AND\r\n SMIT.—GRAVE-YARD AT MOUNT PROSPECT.—LADY FLORENCE DIXIE.—FIRST SESSION\r\n                       IN CAPE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first time I took my seat in the Cape house of assembly on April\r\n5th, 1881, I listened to a debate on a motion introduced by the leader\r\nof the Dutch party, which confirmed me in the intention that I had\r\npreviously formed of paying Natal a visit at the end of the session.\r\n\r\nThis debate was the first, I remember, which touched the question of\r\nDutch feeling _versus_ English, and was in reality the expression of a\r\nsense of gratitude by the Dutch party in the colony to the Gladstone\r\nministry, for entering into negotiations with their brethren in the\r\nTransvaal after the defeat at Majuba, rather than allowing irritation at\r\nthat defeat to prolong the war.\r\n\r\nThe debate led to the house agreeing to an amendment proposed by one of\r\nthe members for Capetown, to the effect: “That this house desires to\r\nexpress its satisfaction at the cessation of hostilities in the\r\nTransvaal, and its earnest hope that all differences may be\r\nsatisfactorily adjusted and a permanent peace established.”\r\n\r\nWhilst listening to the various speakers, I became more than ever\r\nanxious to visit the scenes of the war just closed, and study on the\r\nspot the battlefields where in one campaign we had suffered three\r\ncomplete and disastrous defeats.\r\n\r\nBefore describing my visit to Natal, I must not forget to state that\r\nduring the first session I sat in the Cape house of assembly the time\r\nwas chiefly occupied by Basutoland affairs, and in discussing a vote of\r\ncensure on the government with respect to the war in that country.\r\n\r\nBeing the senior member for Kimberley, and as it was not known to which\r\nside its members leaned, my speech on this subject excited considerable\r\nattention. It was generally expected that if the government were in the\r\nmajority it would depend upon the votes of these members, and this\r\nconjecture proved correct, the result of the division being thirty-seven\r\nvotes for the government and thirty-four against. The Sprigg ministry\r\nfound, however, in a few days, that they could not carry on the\r\ngovernment of the country, and resigned on May 9th. No business of any\r\nimportance was transacted during this session after the resignation of\r\nthe ministry, Mr. J. B. Robinson, my colleague, and I merely looking\r\nafter the local interests of Griqualand West.\r\n\r\nBut to resume. Ten years had flown over since I had left Natal, and many\r\nstriking events had occurred during that period. Langalibalele’s\r\noutbreak, his noble and successful defence by Bishop Colenso, Sir\r\nBenjamin Pine’s recall, Sir Garnet Wolseley’s five months’ politic\r\ninterval, in which he “drowned the independence of the colony in sherry\r\nand champagne,” the Zulu war, and the dethronement of Cetywayo.\r\n\r\nI was anxious as well to see what progress the colony had made in this\r\ninterval, and once again have the pleasure of meeting the many old\r\nfriends whom I possessed there. Consequently, when my parliamentary\r\nduties were over, I left Capetown in the S.S. _Dunkeld_ on the 18th of\r\nJune, and landed in Natal on the 23d. We arrived off the bluff in the\r\nmiddle of the night, and early dawn found me feasting my eyes once more\r\non the glorious view of this land-locked bay, which recalled to memory\r\nmany a pleasant scene of the past.\r\n\r\nGliding gently over the dreaded bar, and landing at daybreak, I made my\r\nway to the Royal Hotel, and after breakfast sallied forth to see what\r\nchanges a decade had wrought. At every step I was agreeably surprised at\r\nthe improvements which I saw. Streets, which ten years before were\r\nknee-deep in sand, I now found hardened, the town council having spent\r\n£40,000 merely in re-forming a few miles of the Musgrave Road leading to\r\nthe Berea; trams hourly running, where in my time horses could barely\r\nwalk. New buildings and fresh stores, a magnificent theatre, and a new\r\ntown hall showing the progress of the place. All, however, were not\r\nsatisfied. One old colonist I met frankly said, “Don’t be deceived,\r\nDoctor, there is no reality in what you see, all imperial money, another\r\nZulu war would suit us just now.” I could not help thinking whether the\r\nsigns I saw were the evidence of real progress or mere ephemeral\r\nprosperity, and I asked myself the question, “Has sugar, has coffee, has\r\nthe Overberg trade done all this?” I knew that two recent and eminent\r\nvisitors had taken a harsh view of Natal and Natalians, having formed\r\nbut hurried opinions of the situation.\r\n\r\nFroude and Archibald Forbes no doubt thought themselves competent to\r\njudge, but the one was just as far wrong, and acted as unfairly to the\r\nbody of Natal colonists, when he said: “Many of these are no better than\r\nthe mean whites in the Southern States of the Union,” as the other when\r\nhe wrote that the leading attributes of Natal colonists are\r\n“untruthfulness, insobriety and swagger.” With due deference to Mr.\r\nFroude, I distinctly say from years of observation, there is no section\r\nin Natal low enough to be compared with the mean white of the Southern\r\nStates, whom even the darkies themselves despise.\r\n\r\nThe mistake which both Froude and Forbes made was one which a well-known\r\nwriter has described as the great error of the nineteenth century, viz,\r\nhasty generalization.\r\n\r\nResting a night I took train to Verulam, Victoria County, my old seat of\r\npractice. This line of rail was all new to me, having been laid since I\r\nleft, though it ran through sugar and coffee plantations which I knew\r\nwell. On arriving at Verulam I procured a horse and rode off to visit\r\nthe various estates in the neighborhood: Redcliffe, the Grange, Ottawa,\r\nHammonds, Waterloo, Trenance, Southburn, Sunderland, and others whose\r\nnames have escaped my recollection, and their hospitable owners I saw\r\nagain. Many of the estates, however, I found had been taken up by\r\nMauritians, and the vacuum pan sugar boilers, as well as the field\r\noverseers, had mostly come from that island, in fact old residents told\r\nme that in the trains running to and from D’Urban there was now almost\r\ncontinually a complete babel of French, English, Hindustani and Kafir. I\r\nmust say that I was disappointed with the general appearance of the\r\ncoast. Coffee enterprise seemed dying out fast, no planting going on,\r\nthe trees suffering from an insect, the “borer,” and from the leaf\r\ndisease (_Hemiteia Vastratrix_), which has played such havoc in Ceylon.\r\nThe extent of land under sugar had increased, but drought, low prices,\r\nand the competition of beet-root were making the planters look serious.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of affairs which struck me as assuming unmanageable\r\nproportions was the keen competition of the cheap-living Asiatic, who in\r\nthe cultivation of small holdings could almost beat the European out of\r\nthe field. When I saw these men, these crofters, themselves working\r\ntheir patches of ground, I was at once let into the secret of their\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWhite men in Natal, as a rule, think manual labor in the fields\r\nderogatory. The only exception to this of which I ever knew was a\r\nsettlement of Germans near D’Urban. From the feeling generally abroad I\r\ncan easily understand the unpalatableness of Froude’s remarks when he\r\nwrote: “Here and there a farmer makes a fortune, but generally the\r\nwhites will not work because they expect the blacks to work for them.\r\nThe blacks will not work because they prefer to be idle, and so no one\r\nworks at all.” After all there is a considerable stratum of truth\r\nrunning through this statement.\r\n\r\nTo return to the coolie question, Indians seem very loath to leave\r\nNatal. I find in the last Natal Blue Book that out of 33,343, comprising\r\nmen of all castes landed from India since immigration began in 1860,\r\nonly 2,141 have returned, the total number of Indians in the colony in\r\n1884 being 27,276, of whom 17,241 were males and 10,035 females.\r\n\r\nGen. Sir J. J. Bissett, in an address to the electors of Alfred and\r\nAlexandra counties in June, 1884, recognizing the importance of this\r\npoint, said: “With regard to coolies, I consider that they are\r\nintroduced for a specific purpose, they should at the expiration of\r\ntheir term of indenture be required to return to India, subject to a\r\nmaximum extension of term (say) to fifteen years in all. I consider that\r\nany benefit derived from them by a section of the community is very\r\ngreatly counterbalanced by the injury their presence causes the colony,\r\nboth directly and indirectly. I am also opposed to coolies holding land\r\nin this colony.”\r\n\r\nIn my opinion Sir J. J. Bissett’s views display a lamentable ignorance\r\nof the first principles of political economy, and are suitable to a\r\ntimid mercantile community only, afraid of the further cheapening of\r\narticles of consumption. A great proportion of the Indians, both in the\r\nWest Indies and in Natal, as soon as they have served their time and are\r\nfree from their indentures, become in every sense thorough colonists;\r\nthey buy property, invest their savings, “marry and are given in\r\nmarriage,” and show no desire, as statistics prove, to return to\r\nIndia—differing entirely from the Chinese, whose sole object is to\r\nreturn home as soon as possible with every sixpence they can drain out\r\nof the country in which they have been living. To my mind the turning\r\naway of thrifty bread winners from a country sparsely populated by an\r\ninfinitesimal working class of whites is the height of absurdity. There\r\nis not even the excuse on the ground of morality which the Americans\r\nhave against the Chinese in California. Moreover, how would Sir J. J.\r\nBissett treat the question of the increase in their population? Would\r\nthe children born in Natal be allowed to remain there or not? Would he\r\nhave the Indians under British rule treated in the same manner as the\r\nDutch have since treated them in the Transvaal State, where, certainly\r\nwithout the “liberty, equality and fraternity” popularly supposed to\r\npertain to republican ideas, they passed a law through the Volksraad,\r\nwhich was promulgated on June 10th, 1885, disqualifying “Coolies, Arabs,\r\nMalays and other Asiatics” from obtaining the right of citizenship, or\r\nfrom possessing landed property, and compelling them further, under\r\npenalty, not only to register themselves, and pay £25 for so doing, but\r\nalso giving the government power to place them in locations;[66] or\r\nwould he have them treated as they are in the other Dutch republic (the\r\nFree State), where it is contrary to law to let fixed property to Arabs,\r\nand where they cannot even procure a license to trade.\r\n\r\nNo! Thank God such outrages cannot be committed under the British flag!\r\nIn Natal less false pride, greater economy and industry are all the\r\nrequisites necessary to produce a competition vigorous enough to stem\r\nthe tide of Asiatic intrusion. There is one fact, however, which Natal\r\ncolonists have seriously to face which is that to every white man there\r\nare at least thirteen Kafirs and one Indian.\r\n\r\nThe great point to my mind is for the European element to retain the\r\nvoting power within fixed limits.\r\n\r\nAfter my visit to Victoria County I returned to D’Urban and took train\r\nto the capital, Pietermaritzburg. The railway again was all new to me.\r\nNo pleasant rest at host Padley’s now, no exciting drive round the\r\nInchanga, no gallop over Camperdown Flats! Simply a six hours’\r\nmonotonous railway trip.\r\n\r\nThe first sight I caught and the first hand I grasped on my arrival was\r\nthat of good Bishop Colenso, who met me at the station. Ten years had\r\npassed since last we met, but how delighted was I to see the same\r\npenetrating eye, the same majestic figure, the same elastic step, and to\r\nhear the same cheery voice as in years gone by. I had a long talk with\r\nhim and his talented and philanthropic daughter over the events which\r\nhad occurred during the years that I had been absent from Natal. Church\r\nmatters and matters of state kept us engaged until evening approached,\r\nwhen the bishop started for Bishopstowe, leaving me to spend the night\r\nwith my friends in Pietermaritzburg. Bishop Colenso was indeed one of\r\nthose few men “who never swam with the stream, who bravely strove to\r\nstem the current, and regardless alike of popular and aristocratic favor\r\npleaded with his latest breath for what he thought to be right and\r\njust.”\r\n\r\nLittle did I think when he shook me by the hand on getting into his\r\ncarriage that I should never see him again. It is a benign provision for\r\nus mortals that the future is wrapped in obscurity!\r\n\r\nI left Pietermaritzburg the next day, June 30th, at 11 A. M., passed\r\nHowick and the magnificent falls of the Umgeni, and reached the Plough\r\nhotel, Estcourt, where I had a short rest. Leaving there at 2:30 in the\r\nmorning I arrived at Ladysmith at noon, where we changed horses. The\r\nfeeling against the “ignoble peace,” as it was called, I found\r\nincreasing the nearer I approached the seat of the late war. In the\r\nhotel where the mail cart changed horses the landlord had just posted up\r\nthe following notice:\r\n\r\n                        Sacred to the memory of\r\n                                 HONOR,\r\n                     The beloved wife of John Bull,\r\n                     She died in the Transvaal and\r\n                  Was buried at Candahar, March 1881.\r\n                           Her end was peace.\r\n\r\nand it was curious to see the soldiers and civilians crowding round the\r\nplacard and to listen to their very candid if not complimentary remarks\r\non the Gladstonian ministry.\r\n\r\nRight opposite the hotel where we stopped was to be seen the large\r\nloop-holed laager, I should say, roughly speaking, about 300 yards\r\nsquare, which had been built by the villagers during the late scare. As\r\nwe drove out of the village to Newcastle I saw how “in this weak, piping\r\ntime of peace” the pomps of war could be utilized, for our parting\r\nrecollection of Ladysmith was the sight of a large crowd of the youth\r\nand fashion of the neighborhood parading round a military band belonging\r\nto the troops stationed there, which was discoursing proud martial\r\nstrains, a sorry satire on the situation!\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, toiling up the Biggarsberg, we came upon a batch of\r\nZulus, fine, strapping, jovial fellows, forming a large road party. At\r\nthe moment what should appear in sight but two ambulance wagons full of\r\nour wounded men, just sufficiently recovered to be removed to one of the\r\nbare hospitals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRAVE-YARD AT MOUNT PROSPECT.—TOMBSTONES OF SIR POMEROY COLLEY AND\r\n    COL. DEANE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis sight was enough of itself to make all the Zulus stop work and\r\n“wau” with curiosity. Seeing some wounded men accompanying the\r\nambulances one Zulu bursting with fun and grinning from ear to ear,\r\nshouted out, “Sakubona,” (“I see you,” a form of greeting) “Johnny! upi\r\nlo Dutchman?” (“Where is the Dutchman?”) of course a regular peal of\r\nlaughter at once followed this sally of native wit. I can assure my\r\nreaders, that as an Englishman I sincerely felt for our wounded soldiers\r\nthus tauntingly jeered at, and I was able to estimate the tremendous\r\nshock that our prestige had received among the aborigines. The Zulus\r\nrecognized the situation at once, the only thing our poor fellows could\r\ndo was to grind their teeth and curse their fate as they wearily trudged\r\nalong, victims of vanity[67] and misjudgment, the defeated of Laing’s\r\nNek, Ingogo and Majuba!\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the retrocession of the Transvaal was a violation\r\nof a series of guarantees which had been previously given. Not only Mr.\r\nGladstone and Lord Kimberley, but also Sir Garnet Wolseley, Sir Bartle\r\nFrere, Sir Theo. Shepstone and Sir Owen Lanyon had over and over again\r\ndeclared that the Transvaal would remain English territory, and that\r\nunder _no_ circumstances could the annexation be reversed. These\r\nemphatic utterances were made long before the outbreak of hostilities,\r\nand consequently the withdrawal of English rule after the Dutch had\r\ngained four signal victories within nine weeks, could be interpreted\r\nonly by both Dutch and natives as an act, not of principle and equity,\r\nbut of weakness and defeat. My friend, Mr. C. K. White, one of the\r\nnominees appointed by Sir Garnet Wolseley to the legislative council,\r\nwhich he gave as a sop to the Transvaal Boers, in a letter at the time\r\nappealed to Mr. Gladstone in the following touching words: “If, sir, you\r\nhad seen, as I have seen, promising young citizens of Pretoria dying of\r\nwounds received for their country, and if you had had the painful duty,\r\nas I have had, of bringing to their friends at home the last mementoes\r\nof the departed; if you had seen the privations and discomforts which\r\ndelicate women and children bore without murmuring for upward of three\r\nmonths; if you had seen strong men crying like children at the cruel and\r\nundeserved desertion of England; if you had seen the long strings of\r\nhalf desperate loyalists, shaking the dust off their feet as they left\r\nthe country, which I saw on my way to Newcastle; and if you yourself had\r\ninvested your all on the strength of the word of England, and now saw\r\nyourself in a fair way of being beggared by the acts of the country in\r\nwhich you trusted, you would, sir, I think, be ‘pronounced,’ and England\r\nwould ring with eloquent entreaties and threats which would compel a\r\nhearing.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gladstone, however, changed his previously declared convictions. On\r\nJanuary 21st, 1880, he stated in the House of Commons: “I must look to\r\nthe obligations entailed by the annexation, and if in my opinion, and in\r\nthe opinion of many on this side of the house, wrong was done by the\r\nannexation itself, that would not warrant us in doing fresh, distinct\r\nand separate wrong by a disregard of the obligations which that\r\nannexation entailed;” or again on June 8th, 1880, when in answer to\r\nMessrs Kruger and Joubert who had written to him, asking him to rescind\r\nthe annexation of the Transvaal, he said “our judgment is that the Queen\r\ncannot be advised to relinquish her sovereignty over the Transvaal.” Yet\r\nlittle more than a year saw this “pronounced” opinion totally changed,\r\nand all confidence in Mr. Gladstone and his ministry almost annihilated\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of South Africa.\r\n\r\nProceeding on my journey I crossed the Ingagane, passed the forts in\r\ncourse of erection by our soldiers close to the river, the heliograph\r\ntwinkling in the sun, and after a long, tiring journey arrived at\r\nNewcastle in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nNewcastle lies on a large grassy plain and in the centre of a district\r\ncontaining no less than 1,350 square miles of workable coal[68] close to\r\nthe surface; and in the near future destined to keep up the credit of\r\nits name when the mines have been properly opened up, it will be noted\r\nfor this production, and then no doubt a railway to the coast being by\r\nthat time _un fait accompli_ will supply the traffic of the eastern\r\nseas.[69] Newcastle was in the zenith of its commercial prosperity\r\nduring the late war, and even when I visited it its glory had not quite\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nWishing to proceed and see Majuba without loss of time, I found this\r\nwould be an impossibility, at least for some days, had not Mr.\r\nGreenlees, an old resident, kindly given me his assistance and offered\r\nto drive me there himself the next day.\r\n\r\nAs a pleasurable interlude, especially in a place like Newcastle, a\r\ngrand concert was advertised, which took place on the evening of my\r\narrival, and the band of the 97th put forward as a special inducement. I\r\nwent and saw a sight that I shall not soon forget. The “gods” were very\r\nuproarious and demonstrative, and not at all reticent in expressing\r\ntheir opinion. One singer, well known as a notorious bouncer about the\r\npower of England and the valor of her troops, on coming on was most\r\ncynically received. To me it was a mystery, but this was explained when\r\nhe commenced to sing:\r\n\r\n                “In days of old, when knights were bold,\r\n                  And barons held their sway;\r\n                A warrior bold, with spurs of gold,\r\n                  Sang merrily his lay,”\r\n\r\nfor a terrific burst of pent-up anger seemed to thrill the “gods.”\r\n“Loop,” “Verdomde Englishman,” “Go and fight the Boers,” “Why did you\r\nrun?” were the cries all round the hall, until the poor fellow slid away\r\namidst the jeers and laughter of the audience.\r\n\r\nStarting early in the morning, we were lucky enough to have as a\r\ncompanion a young colonial volunteer named Maclean, a relative of a\r\nformer governor of Natal, who was one of the brave men who, after the\r\nday’s slaughter, stayed all night with the wounded on the battle field\r\nof Ingogo. Crossing the Incandu, our road lay past Fort Amiel, built\r\nduring the Zulu war, and a twelve miles’ journey, ending in a\r\nprecipitous rise, landed us on the plateau where the battle of Schuin’s\r\nHooghte was fought. Then crossing the drift of the Ingogo, we\r\nbreakfasted at Virmstone’s roadside inn on the bank of the river.\r\n\r\nJust as we were once more inspanning to continue our journey, up rode\r\nLady Florence Dixie and Sir Beaumont on their way to Newcastle. I was\r\nnaturally pleased to have the opportunity of seeing a lady whose\r\nchivalrous defence of Cetywayo afterward had so much to do with his\r\nrestoration, and with whose opinions on the late Zulu war and the\r\ntreatment of the dethroned king I was so much in harmony. I may here\r\nmention that a few months later I had the pleasure of making Lady\r\nFlorence Dixie’s personal acquaintance, when she and Sir Beaumont were\r\npassing through Kimberley.\r\n\r\nBut we had sixteen miles further to travel to Majuba, so on we went,\r\nleaving Mount Prospect and its cemetery on our right. We reached the\r\nfoot of the mountain about 2 P. M. The views of Majuba from the road as\r\nwe approached were simply grand, and it was hard to picture war and its\r\nhorrors invading such a lovely spot!\r\n\r\nI was again fortunate; at the regimental canteen at the bottom I met a\r\ncorporal, who had been in all the three engagements, and persuaded him\r\nto guide us to the top, which he did, whiling away the tediousness of\r\nour mountain climb by relating his experience of the dreadful Sunday\r\n(never to be blotted out of South African history), and by recounting\r\nevents of which he stated that he was an eye-witness, and which, whether\r\nhis account was strictly correct or not, I prefer to leave unrecorded.\r\n\r\nGreenlees, Maclean, myself and our guide all went up the same path,\r\nbeing the _via dolorosa_ the English soldiers under Colley took on the\r\nill-fated night of Feb. 26th, 1881, and not toiling, laden with\r\nammunition and accoutrements, as they did, from 9:30 P. M. to near\r\ndaybreak, but making the four miles’ circuitous ascent in three\r\nhours.[70] The top is just like a large soup plate, sinking down all\r\nround from the sides and flat at the bottom (about 420 yards long by 300\r\nwide), so that no troops resting in the centre could see an enemy\r\nadvancing up the sides of the mountain. Our guide told us the first\r\nintimation he got of the attack of the Dutch was from the consternation\r\nwhich seized every one, when the Boers, who had gained the summit from\r\nthe Transvaal side, suddenly poured into them their first deadly general\r\nvolley, although like other eye-witnesses he said there had been\r\nconsiderable desultory firing since daybreak.\r\n\r\nThis volley at once created such a panic that a regular stampede\r\ncommenced, which the officers tried in vain to stop. It was _sauve qui\r\npeut_.\r\n\r\nI had pointed out to me the perpendicular rocks, some as much as forty\r\nfeet in height, where many of our men killed themselves jumping headlong\r\ndown them in their mad retreat, bleeding, tumbling, dying one on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThere can be no excuse for the disaster of the day. The Boers themselves\r\nwere astonished at their own success. Some apologists, I remember at the\r\ntime, said our men were fatigued with the ascent, but yet they got to\r\nthe top at 3 A. M., long before daybreak, and it was past mid-day when\r\nthe Dutch fired the fatal volley which decided the issue of the day.\r\nSurely this gave hours enough for our soldiers to rest. Then who, I may\r\nask, was responsible for the equipment of the expedition? Where were the\r\nGatling guns and the rockets, which could have rained death and\r\ndestruction on the Boer camp below? Why was no diversion made by us from\r\nour own camp at Mount Prospect? Who superintended the digging of the\r\nintrenchments(?) on Majuba? These and other questions will never now be\r\nanswered. Again, about sixty Boers only gained the summit at first,\r\ntherefore it could not be said our forces (554 rifles) were\r\noutnumbered.[71]\r\n\r\nThe very graves themselves bear silent witness to our blind retreat, for\r\nout of ninety-two killed that day only fifty-nine are buried on the top\r\nof the Majuba. The others, shot like game by the Boers in the wild run\r\nfor life down the mountain sides, and who killed themselves in their\r\npanic-stricken flight, were buried below at the cemetery of Mount\r\nProspect.\r\n\r\nWe remained at the top, enjoying a splendid bird’s-eye view of the\r\nTransvaal, the site of the Boer laager during the war, the battlefield\r\nof Laing’s Nek,[72] our own camp, etc., until the moon rose, when\r\nstarting on our downward journey we reached the bottom at nine o’clock,\r\nand in half an hour were partaking of the hospitalities of Mrs.\r\nGreville’s hotel, where we discussed the merits of that eventful day,\r\nand the question of Dutch strategy _versus_ English mismanagement far\r\ninto the night.\r\n\r\nNext day, before sunrise, I started for Mount Prospect, leaving my\r\ncompanions sleeping, overcome with the previous day’s exertions. A walk\r\nof three miles brought me to the cemetery, thirty yards long by\r\ntwenty-six broad, which was surrounded by a double inclosure, the first\r\nbuilt of sod, the second of stone.\r\n\r\nThe sunrise was magnificent, the air keenly crisp and clear, and the\r\nscenery, with Majuba filling up the background, I have never seen\r\nsurpassed, but a more melancholy sight or one recalling sadder events to\r\nmemory could not be seen the wide world over. Here in this little\r\ngraveyard, all dead in vain, I saw quietly resting all that “outrageous”\r\nfortune had left of disappointed ambition, ruined hopes, and dreams of a\r\nglorious future! Far in the corner were the plain marble crosses erected\r\nto Sir Pomeroy Colley and Colonel Deane. Sir Pomeroy’s simply chronicled\r\nhis death and burial, with the beautiful lines from “In Memoriam:”\r\n\r\n                 “O for thy voice to soothe and bless—\r\n                 What hope of answer or redress?\r\n                 Behind the veil, behind the veil.”\r\n\r\nwhile Colonel Deane’s spoke the truth of a valiant soldier “who fell in\r\naction at Laing’s Nek, at the head of a storming party, ten yards in\r\nfront of the foremost man.” Alongside these were two little wooden\r\ncrosses, pointing out the graves of Doctors Landon and Cornish. On\r\nSurgeon Major Cornish’s grave there was a beautiful wreath, with the\r\ntouching words:\r\n\r\n                    “Now the laborer’s task is o’er,\r\n                    Now the battle’s day is passed;\r\n                    Lands the voyager at last,\r\n                    Safe upon that further shore.”\r\n\r\nIn fact the whole cemetery was like a garden of flowers, the graves\r\ncovered with beautiful wreaths of immortelles, tributes from all parts.\r\n\r\nI may here mention that I had the pleasure in August, 1886, just five\r\nyears after making this visit and five years after the peace was signed,\r\nof being introduced at Barberton-the principal town on the Kaap gold\r\nfields, and elsewhere described—to Commandant General Piet Joubert and\r\nGeneral Smit, who were the Boer commanders at Majuba. I had long been\r\nanxious to hear a _viva voce_ statement of the Boer side of the question\r\nfrom some of the chief actors, and I eagerly seized the opportunity of\r\n“interviewing” the generals. On waiting on them according to appointment\r\nI was very courteously received. General Joubert I found to be a man who\r\nhad seen some sixty summers, of middle height, with a tendency to\r\ncorpulency, a greyish beard, sharp, dark eyes and a pleasing expression\r\nof countenance, though it was easy to see from his firm set mouth that\r\nhe was a man possessed of great determination of character. There was no\r\nmistaking his nationality as his features were in the main those of the\r\ntypical Boer. General Smit was taller, his features more regularly cut\r\nand of sterner cast, and with hair almost grey he looked just the\r\ndetermined man to lead a forlorn hope. General Joubert at once began the\r\nconversation by telling me that for some time he had considered it\r\ndangerous to allow the English forces the chance of obtaining the key to\r\nthe position, which the occupation of Majuba certainly afforded, and\r\nacting on this idea he had determined to occupy the mountain, “but” he\r\nsaid, “before taking this step I was determined with the other\r\ncommandants to make a thorough examination of the locality.” “All came\r\nto the opinion” continued General Joubert, “that the occupation of the\r\nmountain by the English was impossible, but I thought otherwise, and\r\nafter this sent up a picket of fifty men each night. This was commenced\r\non the Thursday night (Feb. 24th) preceding the eventful Sunday on which\r\nMajuba was fought, but by a remarkable act of Providence, the picket\r\nwhich was told off for duty on Saturday night, being composed of\r\nburghers newly arrived from Pretoria, lost the path up the mountain and\r\nspent the night encamped midway.”\r\n\r\n“But,” I asked the general, “hadn’t Colley asked you to disarm?” “I will\r\ntell you,” he replied; “on Friday morning I received a message from\r\nGeneral Colley calling on me to disarm, and saying he would send a\r\ndispatch to the imperial government representing the Boer grievances. I\r\nanswered to the effect I could not do this without first getting\r\npermission of the chairman of the Triumvirate at Heidleberg, a process\r\nwhich would take four days. Now, I thought, all was right till Monday,\r\nand as a proof of my confidence, I even reduced my patrols. What made me\r\nalso more certain was that on the next day I got a letter from President\r\nBrand telling me that there was every chance of negotiations for peace\r\ncoming to a successful conclusion. I sat up late that night making\r\ncopies of Brand’s letter to send to the Triumvirate at Heidleberg and to\r\nGeneral Colley. On going to bed, I can assure you, I couldn’t sleep, my\r\nrest was uneasy and I tossed about till nearly four o’clock in the\r\nmorning, when I called my boy to make a fire. Just as the day was\r\ndawning my wife, who had been with me only a few days, got up to make\r\ncoffee. Going out of the tent she said, ‘see what lots of men are on the\r\nmountain!’ Suspecting nothing I merely said: ‘It is only our own\r\npeople.’ She was not satisfied, however, but got my binocular, and\r\nlooked again, when she called out excitedly: ‘Leave your writing! put\r\ndown your pen! come here! the _English_ are on the mountain!’ I ran out\r\nat once, there was no need for me to take the glass as I could plainly\r\ndistinguish the English troops by their walk. I jumped on my horse,\r\nwhich like all other horses in the camp, according to general orders,\r\nwas saddled at four in the morning, and rode at once to Franz\r\nJoubert[73] who had just come into laager the day before. ‘Now,’ I said,\r\n‘didn’t I tell you the English would get up the mountain? Look, there\r\nthey are.’ He wouldn’t believe me but insisted they were our own people.\r\nAt this juncture I saw the men returning who should have formed the\r\npicket on Majuba the night before, and heard and saw two shots fired on\r\nthem from the hill. I almost lost my temper. ‘Would our own people fire\r\non us?’ I asked. ‘No! they are English, I say.’ When Franz Joubert\r\ncalmly answered, ‘If that is so we shall _have_ to get them down.’\r\nHurriedly telling him to go on up the mountain, while I would go back\r\nand send some more men, I galloped off to our laager. On my way I met my\r\nson with a message from General Smit advising me to come to Laing’s Nek\r\nat once as that might be attacked. So I left instructions for Veld\r\nCornets Roos and Minnaar to attack Majuba on one side with about forty\r\nmen, and the commandant of Utrecht with something like the same number\r\nwould go up the other.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me, general,” I said, “were the English fully aware that the\r\nBoers were really coming up the mountain to attack them?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! of course they were, they knew it for eight hours, as it was five\r\no’clock in the morning when they fired the first two shots, and it was\r\none o’clock when we got to the top.”\r\n\r\n“Then it was not, as it is alleged, a sudden attack in force which\r\ngained the day?”\r\n\r\nThe general smiled at my question. “How could it be when heavy firing\r\nwas going on all the morning up to the very last moment.”\r\n\r\n“When the top was gained by the Boers, what took place next?”\r\n\r\n“There was no resistance, all was over in a minute or two.”\r\n\r\n“But tell me, general, how do you account for the fact that 500 English\r\nshould run before 60 Boers who had just had an eight-hours’ climb up the\r\nmountain?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wish to give any opinion,” said the general, looking serious\r\nindeed, “but I am certain the hand of God was with us all through.” Then\r\nwaxing quite eloquent, he continued: “Men of mine, whom I knew were such\r\ncowards, that in Kafir wars even I have set them to cook the pots,\r\nadvanced with determined step, impressed with the work before them,\r\nactuated, I am sure, by an Almighty power.”\r\n\r\nThen, continuing the narrative, he told me how General Smit sent him\r\nword about three o’clock that Colley was killed and how he forwarded\r\ninstructions that the body should be carefully guarded during the night\r\nwith “all honor and respect,” and that the wounded should be laid\r\ntogether and covered up, the prisoners of war in the meantime being sent\r\nunder escort to the Boer camp and transported the next day by wagon to\r\nHeidleberg.\r\n\r\nConsidering the state of utter demoralization in which our troops had\r\napparently fallen at the time, the Boers having been victorious in every\r\nengagement of the campaign, all Englishmen may be glad that a sudden\r\nmist stopped the attack upon our camp at Mount Prospect, which General\r\nSmit told me the Boers had decided to make, or a yet more disastrous\r\ndefeat would, I feel certain, have been chronicled. I was strongly\r\nimpressed with the belief that General Joubert recognized a divine\r\nProvidence in everything, as over and over again he said, “the hand of\r\nGod was in it all.” I was also informed that when this sudden mist\r\narose, hiding our camp completely from view, that he quietly said: “Look\r\nat the mist, the Lord won’t allow us to go;” seemingly, like Cromwell,\r\nhe was a firm believer in the universality of divine interposition and\r\nso accepted the sudden mist as a command of the Deity! “Thus far shalt\r\nthou go and no further.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Joubert’s description of his interview with Gen. Sir Evelyn\r\nWood, five days after Majuba, was very graphic. I asked the general to\r\nallow me to take notes, to which he consented—when lighting his pipe he\r\nbegan: “You must know, doctor, that five days after the fight General\r\nWood sent to ask me if I would meet him half-way between the two camps.\r\nThis I agreed to do, and we sent wagons and tents from both sides. There\r\nwere myself, General Smit and Mr. Dirkhouse, as clerk on our side, and\r\nGeneral Wood, General Buller and Major Fraser on the English. When I\r\narrived, after wishing each other ‘good morning,’ General Wood asked me:\r\n‘Have you authority to make peace?’ I answered, ‘Yes, on one condition;’\r\nhe said, ‘what is that?’ I replied, ‘the annexation of our country to be\r\nwithdrawn.’ ‘Then,’ I added, ‘her Majesty’s troops can leave with honor,\r\nI want no more.’ ‘But if I sign such a peace, will all agree?’ inquired\r\nthe general. ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘all _must_ in accordance with _our_ law.’\r\nAfter some moments’ deliberation General Wood asked me whether or not I\r\nwould make peace according to the terms offered in a letter sent by Mr.\r\nKruger to General Colley through President Brand. I answered distinctly,\r\n‘No.’ At last General Wood begged that the armistice might be extended\r\nto twenty days to give Mr. Kruger time to arrange about terms, when,\r\nafter discussing the matter for some time, a further cessation of\r\nhostilities for eight days was agreed upon between us, and we left\r\nBuller and Fraser to draw up a document to that effect.\r\n\r\n“As we were standing outside the tent while this document was being\r\nprepared, General Wood told me I should have to get away from the Nek,\r\nbecause it was English territory, but I said: ‘_We_ don’t fight for\r\nground, _we_ don’t claim any; why should I go? If you _mean_ to make\r\npeace, the closer we get the better.’ General Wood replied, ‘I shall\r\nhave to force the place then and drive you away,’ and pointing to his\r\nbreast, and counting his medals one after the other, said: ‘Look, there\r\nare one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine medals, and if\r\nI pitch you out, another, which will make ten.’ I answered: ‘I must\r\ndefend my country at all risks, and stand the consequences,’ He then\r\nlooked straight at me and said: ‘Perchance you may kill me, but that is\r\nnothing; England has sixteen generals more.’ I then turned up my coat,\r\nand pointing to _my_ breast, which was perfectly plain, said: ‘General,\r\nthere is nothing here, and thank God, I want nothing behind that Nek\r\nthere. I have not one single man to be killed for that. (I pointed to a\r\nmedal on his breast.) _We_ do not fight for glory, _we_ fight for\r\nliberty, and for liberty every English general, I know, would also yield\r\nhis life. We have not many generals, but although I and General Smit\r\nlead our men, each man knows he fights for himself and his country.’\r\nGeneral Wood then continued: ‘But what do you think of Colley going up\r\nthe mountain?’ I answered: ‘I don’t know what to think; all I know is\r\nthat I received letters from Brand and Colley only the day before, which\r\ntended to throw me off my guard, and while I was in the very act of\r\nwriting answers Colley took the opportunity to go up the mountain.’ ‘And\r\nyou drove him down?’ ‘I don’t say that, and I am glad no one behind that\r\nNek says that either, but this I will say, that every man of mine when\r\nhe looks at Majuba, when he looks at the top of that mountain there,\r\nthinks of nothing but the wondrous work of the Almighty.’ Wood seemed\r\ntouched. ‘I am not an unbeliever; I also say my prayers,’ he ejaculated.\r\n‘I am glad,’ I said, ‘to hear you say that, but do you know what we pray\r\nfor? We don’t pray to conquer nations and annex countries; what we pray\r\nfor is that Almighty God may so open the eyes of the gracious Queen of\r\nEngland that she and her counsellors may see what is justice and what is\r\nright, then we shall feel sure of our case and know that freedom to our\r\ncountry must come.’\r\n\r\n“We then talked a little about Bronker’s Spruit and other incidents of\r\nthe war, when, the document being finished, we went into the tent to\r\nsign it.”\r\n\r\nShortly after General Joubert concluded the above somewhat melo-dramatic\r\ndescription of his meeting with Sir Evelyn Wood, I took my leave, having\r\nspent a most interesting hour in the society of the generals.\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to the description of my trip of 1881; when I got to\r\nthe hotel I found all prepared for leaving, and after breakfast we\r\nstarted for Newcastle, intending to rest at Ingogo, as we had not time\r\nto visit Laing’s Nek (and moreover we could see the position from the\r\nroad), where Colley’s first defeat took place on Jan. 28th, with a loss\r\nof 260 killed and wounded, and where Colonel Deane and Major Poole\r\n(Cetywayo’s old friend) were shot down. After a pleasant drive we\r\ncrossed the Ingogo drift, the road gradually ascending until the plateau\r\nof Schuin’s Hooghte was reached, where Colley suffered his second defeat\r\non Feb. 7th. Making a _reconnaissance_ that morning with 273 of the 60th\r\nRifles and 38 men of the mounted squadron from Mount Prospect, Colley\r\nwas virtually lured to his destruction. The Boers retired before his\r\nadvance, until having decoyed our troops to Schuin’s Hooghte, a high and\r\nperfectly unsheltered plateau, they opened a galling fire from the other\r\nside of the valley which intervened, a perfectly safe position for them.\r\nThis was at 10:15 A. M., and until sundown our soldiers were nothing\r\nmore or less than English targets for Dutch bullets. The field guns\r\nwhich Colley brought with him were useless; he had nothing to fire at\r\nbut rocks, the Boers finding most excellent cover. The horses were shot\r\ndown at the guns, the mules at the ambulance wagons, nothing living was\r\nsafe for a moment from the Boers’ unerring aim. Maclean pointed out to\r\nme the exact stone, near the centre of the plateau, where Colley, Essex\r\nand Wilkinson took cover most of the day, and gave me a most vivid\r\ndescription of the field when, on a second visit next day, he found the\r\nplace literally stormed by armies of cowardly vultures, attracted by the\r\nputrid effluvium from the rotting carcasses of the dead horses and\r\nmules. With my penknife I picked out splashes of lead from the crevices\r\nof the stones, as relics of the Boers’ accurate sighting. Wilkinson,\r\nbrave young fellow, was drowned the same night in the Ingogo, when\r\npluckily returning with comforts for the wounded, that river having\r\nbecome a sweeping torrent owing to the storm of rain which had been\r\nraging for some hours previous.\r\n\r\nThese poor fellows, left on the plateau in the rain, were totally\r\ndeserted except by one or two, Parson Ritchie, Maclean and Dr. McGan,\r\nColley having made good his retreat in the night with his troops and\r\nguns to Mount Prospect. There these men lay in a heap, the dying and the\r\ndead together, the pitchy darkness of that long, cold, wet, dreary night\r\nnow and again relieved by vivid flashes of lurid lightning. _Only_\r\n142[74] of our soldiers were sacrificed on this occasion. I went to look\r\nat one of the two inclosed grave-yards of these ill-fated men. In the\r\ncorner of a little inclosure by the roadside I found tokens of the\r\nconflict and relics of our loss. The helmets of the dead soldiers,\r\nriddled with bullets, were promiscuously piled together, while all\r\naround could be seen traces of the desolation war had produced.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Boer losses and casualties. The news of the Boers having\r\ntaken the Amajuba mountain reached the Red Cross Association on March\r\n6th, at Bethlehem, O. F. S., when its members at once left for Laing’s\r\nNek, arriving there on March 16th. Dr. A. C. Daumas, in a report which\r\nhe wrote to the secretary of the association, dated Aliwal North, July\r\n29th, 1881, said:\r\n\r\n  “You may easily fancy what our astonishment was on being informed that\r\n  although accepted with thanks, our services were by no means so urgent\r\n  and necessary as we had at first supposed.\r\n\r\n  “In fact, the hospital established by Dr. Merinski, close to the camp,\r\n  only contained in all one man sick and three wounded.”\r\n\r\nFurther on, in the same report, Dr. Daumas stated:\r\n\r\n  “It would be rather difficult to tell accurately the number of Boers\r\n  encamped in this pass (Laing’s Nek), but I do not think I am far from\r\n  the truth in estimating their number at 1,000 men.\r\n\r\n  “This small army subsisted there without the help of any commissariat;\r\n  each man was obliged to provide himself with his own food, which\r\n  consisted generally in a purely animal diet. He did not receive any\r\n  pay, and had beside to get his accommodation at his own expense. His\r\n  obedience to his commanders was absolute. The most perfect order\r\n  prevailed in this camp, where, strange to say, there never was any\r\n  drilling done. Far from being intoxicated with their victories, the\r\n  Boers always showed themselves extremely modest, attributing all their\r\n  successes to the protection of heaven.... But what remains to be\r\n  explained is how an army of several thousand men may have been able to\r\n  take the field and keep it during several months without commissariat,\r\n  and especially without any medical service, and should not have been\r\n  more subject to the class of diseases which are in time of war the\r\n  ordinary sad attendants of all armies.\r\n\r\n  “Should not the reason of these facts lie in this, _i.e._, that owing\r\n  to his sobriety and to the strength of his constitution the Boer has\r\n  been able to resist the physical causes which produce those diseases;\r\n  as also through his political faith, coupled with genuine religious\r\n  faith, he has been able to bear up against the moral causes.”\r\n\r\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that all through the war the Boers had\r\nimplicit faith in divine assistance.\r\n\r\nLeaving Schuin’s Hooghte we hurried to Newcastle, and next day I left\r\nfor Ladysmith, intending to catch the mail cart which runs from the\r\nRising Sun to Bloemfontein, and so through the Free State to Kimberley.\r\n\r\nPassing through Harrismith, the border town of the Free State, we came\r\nto Bethlehem, where I saw the handsome Dutch Church, just finished at a\r\ncost of £16,000, and passing Senekal at 5 A. M., nearly frozen in the\r\npitch darkness, I arrived in Winburg at twelve, at noon. Dr. Dixon, the\r\nleading practitioner there, soon found me out, and dining at his table\r\nwith some Kimberley speculators, on coal not diamonds bent, spent a very\r\npleasant afternoon. The post-cart left at 6:30 P. M.; at eight next\r\nmorning we were in Bloemfontein, and everything going favorably along,\r\nJuly 12th saw me once more on the diamond fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n TRIP TO ROBBEN ISLAND.—DEAN NEWMAN’S DESCRIPTION THEREOF IN 1855.—OLD\r\n SOMERSET HOSPITAL.—LUNATICS AND LEPERS.—HORRIBLE SIGHTS.—LEPROSY AMONG\r\nANIMALS.—DR.

Maitland communicating it to the home\r\ngovernment as “a plan proposed by Mr. Montague.” Dean Newman in his\r\nmemoirs of the last-named gentleman, written in 1855, gives a very\r\ngraphic description of the island: “It is a spot of painful and touching\r\ninterest still, the unapproachable asylum of the leper and the lunatic;\r\nthe _ultima linea verum_, the last shore of the disabled sailor stranded\r\nthere an utter wreck of humanity; the remote infirmary and resting place\r\nfor decay and sickness hopelessly incurable! It seems a kind of half-way\r\nhalt in departure from the world; for many of its sojourners have bidden\r\nthe happy face of mankind and the spots of active life a long and last\r\nfarewell;” and, after the sights I saw there, I felt I could fully\r\nendorse every one of the dean’s words.\r\n\r\nForty years ago old Somerset hospital was the only lunatic asylum in the\r\ncolony, but the miserable accommodation it afforded and the wretchedness\r\nof its unfortunate inmates led Mr. Montague to recommend the\r\nestablishment of a lunatic asylum on Robben Island.\r\n\r\nTo quote further from Dean Newman: “Robben Island appears destined,\r\nunder all changes, to remain a spot of melancholy interest, cut off from\r\nthe mainland by a wild sea, prevailing impetuous winds, and a distance\r\nof six miles—yet constantly in sight of it—it is a fit emblem of the\r\nmiserable inhabitants who have in successive ages been transported\r\nthere, severed from all association with the rest of their fellow men.\r\n\r\n“For more than 150 years this island was the Dutch penal settlement and\r\nif the old record speaks truth most rigid were the punishments which\r\nwere then inflicted. On the transference of the Cape to the English the\r\nisland continued a convict station under British rule; but as we have\r\nseen there was no extraordinary desire manifested even then to make its\r\ndiscipline such as should reform the criminal or hold out to him the\r\nprospect of restoration to that society whose laws he had transgressed.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“When on a visit of inquiry to the island previous to the removal of the\r\nconvicts he [Mr. Montague] noticed its healthy position and its fitness\r\nas a hospital for those whose complaints rendered it necessary for them\r\nto be removed from the less afflicted of their race.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“In his report on that occasion he thus refers to the suitableness of\r\nthe island for patients and to the condition of the sick, diseased and\r\ninsane who were under the charge of the government in different\r\ninfirmaries, and establishments of the colony:\r\n\r\n  “‘As the salubrity of Robben Island has long been acknowledged, and\r\n  there is abundance of stone, lime and labor on the spot to erect the\r\n  necessary buildings, I would strongly recommend for your excellency’s\r\n  serious consideration the expediency of removing the leper and pauper\r\n  establishments of Hemet-au-Aarde and Port Elizabeth to Robben Island,\r\n  also the pauper establishment of Capetown, and the lunatics at present\r\n  confined in the Somerset hospital at Capetown.\r\n\r\n  “‘I have also visited the lunatics confined in the Somerset hospital;\r\n  anything more wretched and inappropriate for its unfortunate inmates\r\n  cannot be imagined than the lunatic wards; they are about fifty in\r\n  number. There is no other lunatic asylum in this colony, and lunatics\r\n  are sent to this one from all parts of the colony. It is quite\r\n  impossible that the present mode of confining and treating these\r\n  unhappy people can be much longer continued, a separate and proper\r\n  building must very soon be erected for them somewhere, and I know of\r\n  no place better suited for them than Robben Island.’”\r\n\r\nWhen it was decided that the indigent and various patients in the\r\nhospitals of the colony should be removed to Robben Island, measures\r\nwere promptly taken to erect suitable dwellings and infirmaries for\r\ntheir reception. The convicts were removed to road stations; the old\r\nconvict buildings, which were much dilapidated, were pulled down, and\r\nthis once barren scene, which had so long withered under the accursing\r\ninfluence of crime and the stern frown of retributive justice, began to\r\nsmile under the beneficent influence of human kindness, sympathy and\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nThere are now (1855) on the island about twenty buildings, with spacious\r\napartments, airy, healthy and scrupulously clean. Externally the sunny,\r\nwhitewashed appearance of the houses has an air of cheerfulness, and the\r\nneat church rising near them speaks of solace to the sick soul, as the\r\nrest of the institution does of care to the diseased body.\r\n\r\nThe establishment as reported in May, 1854, was:\r\n\r\n                            Men. Women. Children. Total.\r\n               Lepers         38     20         8     66\r\n               Lunatics       49     53         4    106\r\n               Chronic Sick  106     21         2    129\r\n                                                    ————\r\n                  Total                              301\r\n\r\nThe division for the lunatics is commodious, well-arranged and striking\r\nfrom its great cleanliness; the chief occupation of those who are merely\r\nidiotic, or but periodically insane, being to keep it neat and\r\nwholesome. The sleeping compartments are ranged round two small\r\ncourt-yards, one for the men, the other for the women. In the day-time\r\nfew of the lunatics are to be seen in the court-yard or dormitories, as\r\nthe plan pursued by the medical officer is to allow all but the most\r\nviolent and unsafe to roam at pleasure about the island. One is commonly\r\nset to watch another, and if you question A, whom you see on a strict\r\nand consequential lookout in some part of the island, on what he is so\r\nclosely intent, with a sly smile he will point to B, and say, “I am\r\ntaking care of that poor fellow;” but when you approach B and put a like\r\ninterrogatory to him, he will tell you, casting a cunning glance at A,\r\n“I am looking after him, he is not quite right.” The less violent are\r\nused as servitors in the general establishment and perform much outdoor\r\nwork about the island, and even take part in the management of the\r\nisland boat which crossed to and fro to the mainland three times a week.\r\n\r\nAmongst the most confirmed lunatics, who seldom go at large, are some\r\npainfully ludicrous cases. A sturdy black woman dressed in male\r\nappearance, if not absolutely in male attire, personates an African\r\nking, and certainly in words and imperious looks lords it over her\r\nsubjects there, “in King Cambyses’ vein.” Another case from which the\r\nspectator almost religiously recoils is that of a little man from St.\r\nHelen’s, who is sane enough when spoken to on ordinary subjects, but if\r\nthe Bible be mentioned, becomes instantly furious, and asserts that the\r\nNew Testament (a copy of which he always has about him, and can read\r\nfluently in English and even quote with considerable correctness) is\r\n_his_ gospel and that he is Jesus Christ. If reasoned with on this point\r\nhe falls into such fierce paroxysms of wildness and violence as may well\r\ncause him to be taken for one of those demoniacs whom the merciful\r\nSaviour came to liberate and heal. But even with these most extreme\r\ncases, the lenient, judicious treatment which is practiced in this\r\ndepartment, keeping the occasionally furious under close surveillance,\r\nrather than iron restraint, is found to answer far better than the old\r\ncustom of the narrow cell, the griping gyve, and unmitigated\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nOn a remarkably healthy and, as to aspect, cheerful spot near the sea,\r\nand commanding a fine view of Table Mountain and of the bold rocky coast\r\nbehind it, are the buildings which contain the wards of chronic sick.\r\nHere are to be witnessed some of those sorrowful cases which are to be\r\nmet with in all such asylums; such as slow wasting disease; the\r\nincurable maladies of the long sick, who have consulted many physicians\r\nand have been nothing bettered; the gradual sinking into the grave of\r\nthose who have seemed for years upon its brink. For these, all that can\r\nbe done is to relieve pain and make the last moments of life tranquil\r\nand free from want, and certainly at Robben Island this is done. The\r\ntreatment, the dietary, the attendance, and even the kindness of one\r\npatient toward another, are here most praiseworthy.\r\n\r\nI could see, on my visit, that although years have elapsed since this\r\nwas written, every kindness was still shown by the officials to the\r\nunfortunates on Robben Island; still the surroundings were not such as\r\ncould possibly tend to their recovery. The large ram-shackle buildings\r\nhad an air of patchwork and decay, the yards were overcrowded, no\r\nemployment or amusement could I see provided, except in the female ward,\r\nwhere I listened to one poor woman yawling out “Home, sweet home” on a\r\npiano more out of tune than her mind. A sad and sorry sight! Here, as in\r\nall similar institutions, there was every phase of this melancholy\r\naffliction to be observed. Since my visit Dr. Biccard has died, and the\r\ninstitution is now under the care of Dr. Ross, according to whose report\r\nlast year there are now on the island 199 lunatics, some of whom have\r\nbeen there for thirty-five years. He states that but a small percentage\r\nof these cases can be looked upon as hopeful, owing to the length of\r\ntime that has been allowed to elapse before they were brought under\r\nproper treatment. In one of his previous reports Dr. Ross observed: “If\r\ncases are treated within three months of the first attacks, four-fifths\r\nwould recover, but if twelve months elapsed, four-fifths are incurable;”\r\nfurther, the material upon which to work is “very _unpromising_, and\r\nhence the fallacy of expecting European results when dealing with these\r\nlife-long burdens on the country whose unsoundness of mind and unbridled\r\npassions render them equally unfit for liberty or neglect.”\r\n\r\nI may also mention that there is under government supervision a hospital\r\nat Grahamstown, where last year 108 male and 67 female lunatics were in\r\nconfinement, while old Somerset hospital is still used for chronic sick\r\npaupers, insane and female lepers, containing at the close of last year\r\n55 male, 41 female lunatics, 141 chronic sick paupers, and 13 female\r\nlepers.\r\n\r\nLeaving Dr. Biccard with the ladies, I walked on to inspect the lepers\r\nand the buildings in which they were housed. Here I saw human beings\r\nkenneled worse than dogs. In a long, low, thatched shed some forty poor\r\ncreatures were stowed away. Both varieties of the disease, the\r\ntubercular and anæsthetic, could here be studied. Some I saw with their\r\nfaces shiny, discolored and swollen, others with both hands and feet\r\ndropping off joint by joint; one man especially attracting my attention,\r\nwhose nose, eyes, tongue and cheeks had all rotted away, and who, with a\r\nvoice piping shrill and cracked, could barely make himself understood.\r\nHe was a horrid, loathsome mass of putrid humanity. One fact, however,\r\nstruck me at the time, that neither this man nor any of the other\r\ninmates complained of bodily pain. The building in which they were\r\nhoused was such that I could not help picturing in my mind a spark\r\nigniting the thatch and a fire taking place in this hovel; how the poor\r\nwretches, sixty per cent. of whom were unable to leave their beds, would\r\nin their helplessness be burnt alive, possibly only too glad to find\r\nsurcease of sorrow, at least in this world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEPER DEPARTMENT.—ROBBEN ISLAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHere were black, half-caste and white all mixed together in hideous\r\nconfusion, but, thank heaven! no females; the latter had been removed, I\r\nlearned, some time before to Old Somerset hospital, not alas, however,\r\nuntil cohabitation had produced its results in beings almost, I fear,\r\ninevitably doomed to a life worse than death, and recalling Coleridge’s\r\nlines in his “Ancient Mariner”\r\n\r\n                  “The nightmare Death in life is she\r\n                  Who chills men’s blood with cold.”\r\n\r\nThese woe-begone creatures were allowed to go to the mainland if they\r\nwished once every three months, according to the criminally absurd\r\nenactments then in force. Of this opportunity many availed themselves,\r\nnever returning, but sowing the seeds of a disease, hereditary and\r\npossibly contagious, as some believe it to be, broadcast through the\r\nland with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe lepers were, as a rule, idle, insolent and insubordinate, and\r\nknowing the incurable nature of their disease reckless and desperate to\r\na degree. Half-castes, Malays, especially those whose morality was below\r\nthe average, or those whose diet was, as a rule, confined almost\r\nexclusively to fish, I was told were more susceptible to the disease\r\nthan Europeans. On making inquiries I learned many horrible facts. Among\r\nothers I found the bath-room and the kitchen to be identical, one place\r\nonly being provided for them in which to live, eat, drink and sleep, the\r\n“wash” or refuse and almost certainly contaminated food actually being\r\nused to feed the pigs and poultry, and, “Horror on horror’s head” the\r\nmiserable sufferers themselves could be seen rolling about in squalid\r\nfilth, their clothes soaked and besmeared with the discharges from their\r\nfestering sores. No one seemed to have power or inclination to manage\r\nthem; neglected and forsaken, they were left to the charge of fellow\r\nlepers as helpless as themselves, Horace’s “Quis custodiet ipsos\r\ncustodes?” never having a better exemplification.\r\n\r\nDr. Wynne, the assistant medical officer in charge, who has had\r\nconsiderable experience of this disease in Bulgaria and Constantinople,\r\nalthough not noticing among the common fowls the tender-footedness,\r\nbowing of the legs, incurvated claws, and the nodular articulations\r\nwhich are the earliest symptoms of the disease in animals, yet\r\ndistinctly stated in evidence before a select committee of the house of\r\nassembly in 1883 that he had come across pigeons, mice, pheasants and\r\nturkeys unmistakably suffering from leprosy; and he further remarked at\r\nthe time that “the communicableness of this disease to animals is a\r\nmatter of great importance, for the reason that it may also be\r\ncommunicable to human beings through the agency of animals suffering\r\nfrom the disease being used as food.”\r\n\r\nAfter seeing and conversing with these poor social outcasts, and at the\r\nsame time having had convincing proofs afforded me every day, from\r\noutside sources, of the increase of leprosy among the lower and colored\r\nclasses, I left the island with the conviction that nothing but complete\r\nsegregation could ever stamp out this dreadful disease. The success\r\nwhich has since 1865 attended the complete isolation of affected persons\r\nin the Sandwich Islands, where leprosy was unknown before its\r\nintroduction by the Chinese in 1848, as compared with the immense\r\nstrides the disease was then making, should be an inducement to our\r\nlegislators to adopt the most stringent measures here, the more\r\nespecially seeing how widespread this terrible and loathsome disease is\r\nbecoming. It may not be generally known, but it certainly bears out the\r\ngenerally received theory of the contagiousness of leprosy, that the\r\napostle of the lepers of Molokai is beginning to pay the penalty of his\r\nheroism. Shut away from all civilized and healthy humanity, Father\r\nDamien has for years been a willing prisoner in the island in which are\r\ncollected and confined the lepers of all the neighboring Sandwich group.\r\nFor a long time, though cut off from the outward world, Father Damien\r\ncontinued in good health, though alone among the dead. But the stroke\r\nhas fallen at last. In a letter written recently he says: “Impossible\r\nfor me to go any more to Honolulu on account of the leprosy breaking out\r\non me. The microbes have finally settled themselves in my left leg and\r\nmy ear, and one eyebrow begins to fall. I expect soon to have my face\r\ndisfigured. Having no doubt myself of the true character of my disease I\r\nfeel calm, resigned and happier among my people. Almighty God knows what\r\nis best for my sanctification, and with that conviction I say daily a\r\ngood ‘Fiat voluntas Tua.’” Where is the heroism which will vie with\r\nthis? And does not Father Damien’s martyrdom tend to establish the\r\ncontagious nature of the scourge?\r\n\r\nThe following extract from the “People’s Medical Adviser” (London),\r\nbearing upon the question, is interesting: “The following is a summary\r\nof an account in the New York _Medical Record_, of the first attempt to\r\nuse a condemned criminal for the solution of an important and scientific\r\nquestion at the Sandwich Islands. It appears that more than two years\r\nago the government procured the services of Dr. Edward Arning, for the\r\npurpose of having a thorough and scientific study made of leprosy.\r\nAttempts were made to cultivate the _bacillus lepræ_, which is uniformly\r\nfound in the diseased parts, but not in the blood, by Kock’s method,\r\nusing various media, but without success. Numerous inoculation\r\nexperiments upon lower animals were made, but although the bacilli would\r\ngrow at the points of inoculation for a long time, the animal never\r\nbecame infected. At last Dr. Arning obtained permission to make an\r\ninoculation upon a condemned criminal, whose sentence was commuted to\r\nimprisonment for life. With the convict’s written consent an inoculation\r\nof leprous matter was made in his arm, and bacilli were found in the\r\nsore or the scar up to fourteen months after the operation; no\r\nconstitutional symptoms being observed. One further observation of\r\nimportance was made by Dr. Arning; he found that in putrid leprous\r\ntissues, and even in the body of a leper who had been dead for three\r\nmonths, the bacilli were found in great numbers. This seems to bear\r\nagainst their specific pathogenetic function. Owing to difficulties with\r\nthe health board, it is stated that it is highly probable Dr. Arning\r\nwill be obliged to discontinue his work of research. With respect to the\r\ncultivation of bacillus, Dr. Neisser, of Breslau, appears to have been\r\nmore successful than Dr. Arning, for he has recently stated that in a\r\nfew cases he has observed an exceedingly slow growth, and he also claims\r\nto have recognized spores, which the Hawaiian observer has so far failed\r\nto do.”\r\n\r\nI do not consider, however, that these experiments in any way prove the\r\nnon-communicability of the disease, when we take into consideration the\r\nlength of time (ten to fifty years) that leprosy takes to destroy the\r\ngeneral run of its victims.\r\n\r\nNot only can it be seen here and there over the whole Cape Colony, at\r\nFort Beaufort, Malmesbury, Saldahna Bay, Caledon, Fraserburg, Calvenia,\r\nClanwilliam, Hopetown, in Fingoland and Namaqualand, but even at Weeren\r\nand Alexandra County, especially in the Amapapeta location. In Natal its\r\nravages are attracting attention among the members of my profession and\r\nphilanthropists generally. In the latter colony a commission was\r\nappointed on January 27th, 1885, by Sir Henry Bulwer to inquire into the\r\nextent of leprosy then existing. The report of that commission was\r\npublished in the Natal Government _Gazette_ of September 23d, 1886, and\r\nconclusively demonstrated that leprosy was widely spread and was slowly\r\nincreasing among the native population, and recommended as a means of\r\nchecking the disease the enforcement of strict segregation. Surely some\r\nmethod for its arrest or eradication might be taken from the lessons\r\ntaught by other countries and from experience of the past! After the\r\ncrusades in the fifteenth century leprosy played sad havoc in Europe,\r\nbut taking alarm in time the lepers were sought out and separated from\r\ntheir fellows, Norway being the only country in Europe where this system\r\nwas not adopted, and while the disease has disappeared in other lands,\r\nin the last named, after the lapse of more than three hundred years, it\r\nstill lives.[75] This disease is also found in Greenland, Iceland, where\r\nit is termed “likthra,” in Lapland and the Faroes, but in these more\r\nnorthern regions, as leprosy is not considered to be contagious, its\r\nvictims are objects more of pity than disgust. I believe that many\r\nlocal, lay and professional men think it a far-off disease, entombed in\r\nbiblical lore; if so let them at once disabuse their minds of this idea\r\nand learn that this awful malady is a rapidly increasing scourge of\r\nto-day, extending from the North Pole to the South, from Iceland to\r\nAustralia, India and America; Africa and Arabia supplying their quota of\r\nvictims. “It distorts and scars and hacks and maims and destroys its\r\nvictims inch by inch, feature by feature, member by member, joint by\r\njoint, sense by sense, leaving him to cumber the earth and tell the\r\nhorrid tale of a living death, till there is nothing human left of him.\r\nEyes, voice, nose, toes, fingers, feet, hands, one after the other, are\r\nslowly deformed and rot away, until at the end of ten, fifteen or twenty\r\nyears it may be, the wretched leper, afflicted,, in every sense,\r\nhimself, and hateful to the sight, smell, hearing and touch of others,\r\ndies despised and the most abject of men.”\r\n\r\nDr. Keith Guild, M.D., district surgeon of East Griqualand, in a\r\npamphlet published this year on leprosy, arrives at the conclusion that\r\n“leprosy is a blood poison arising from the combination of two other\r\nblood poisons, tubercular and syphilitic,” and goes on to assert that\r\n“leprosy among the natives of South Africa is neither more nor less than\r\na form of tertiary syphilis.” There is a manifest inconsistency between\r\nthese two statements, but if the latter be a correct one it must also\r\napply to leprosy in general, which I myself would be very sorry for one\r\nmoment to admit, for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\nLooking upon this frightful picture, is it not time, I will ask, we were\r\n“up and doing” before it be too late?\r\n\r\nTo come down to figures: the cost of each leper on Robben Island is £63\r\nper annum: while the total expenditure of the island annually, including\r\nlunatics in 1885, was £15,482, of which £5,000 was expended in salaries.\r\n\r\nThe following is a return of the leper patients admitted in the general\r\ninfirmary, Robben Island, from the year 1845 to July 31, 1883,\r\ninclusive, the number remaining about the same, as fresh cases were only\r\nadmitted as old ones died off:\r\n\r\n                     1845                        37\r\n                     1846                        35\r\n                     1847                        17\r\n                     1848                        26\r\n                     1849                        18\r\n                     1850                        14\r\n                     1851                         7\r\n                     1852                        13\r\n                     1853                        21\r\n                     1854                        14\r\n                     1855                        16\r\n                     1856                        15\r\n                     1857                        16\r\n                     1858                        19\r\n                     1859                        16\r\n                     1860                        13\r\n                     1861                        21\r\n                     1862                        22\r\n                     1863                        22\r\n                     1864                        12\r\n                     1865                        34\r\n                     1866                        19\r\n                     1867                        20\r\n                     1868                        21\r\n                     1869                        15\r\n                     1870                        24\r\n                     1871                        27\r\n                     1872                        17\r\n                     1873                        17\r\n                     1874                        19\r\n                     1875                        13\r\n                     1876                        17\r\n                     1877                        26\r\n                     1878                        19\r\n                     1879                        13\r\n                     1880                        15\r\n                     1881                        24\r\n                     1882                        21\r\n                     1883—Jan. 1st to July 31st   9\r\n                                                ———\r\n                               Total            744\r\n\r\nAfter leaving these pitiable and miserable sights, Dr. Biccard invited\r\nour party to lunch, when we conversed with this genial old gentleman\r\nupon what we had seen, and over the past and future of the island. Then\r\nafter enjoying a fragrant cigar with Dr. Wynne we returned to the\r\nmainland by the _Gun_ on her afternoon trip.\r\n\r\nSince our visit the government have decided to remove the lunatics to\r\nthe mainland, having bought the farm Tokai near Capetown for that\r\npurpose, but at present the finances of the colony are at too low an ebb\r\nto warrant further expenditure, with a view to the introduction of any\r\nimproved mode of treatment for these unfortunate people.\r\n\r\nAn act for the segregation of lepers has also been passed by the Cape\r\nlegislative assembly (No. 8, 1884), which although a step in the right\r\ndirection is exceedingly weak in some of its provisions. The main and\r\nvital point, compulsory removal, is altogether omitted, it being merely\r\nmade lawful for the governor, on the certificate of a district surgeon\r\nor any other medical practitioner to the effect that a man or woman is a\r\nleper and the disease communicable, to authorize his or her removal, but\r\nno order is inserted in the ordinance that _all_ lepers shall be brought\r\nbefore the district surgeon for such certificate, and that such\r\ncertificate shall be acted upon.\r\n\r\nDr. Ross, the present superintendent of the island, states in his last\r\nreport (1886) that “unless the segregation act includes a denial of all\r\ncivil rights, the bastardy of all children born to lepers, and\r\nconfiscation of their property for their public and special support and\r\ntreatment, this horrible disease will never be stamped out.”\r\nNotwithstanding all the forcible lessons of the past I learn that the\r\ngovernment (June 1886) are erecting wooden huts on the island at\r\nMurray’s Bay for the use of female lepers, thus holding out, as it were,\r\na premium for the direct propagation of lepers; experience having shown\r\nthat it is impossible to keep the sexes apart when located on the same\r\nisland. The only saving clause is that very few children are born of\r\nleprous parents. I may here emphatically state my opinion that if strict\r\nsegregation were enforced this dire disease would in half a century be a\r\nscourge of the past, and, I may add, that I am in accordance with all\r\nthe best authorities in the belief that this is the only method by which\r\nthis terrible and loathsome disease can ever be eradicated.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a most agreeable and interesting day on the island, a\r\npleasant hour’s sail brought us in the afternoon to the mainland, the\r\nsea having in the meantime become perfectly calm.\r\n\r\nThe next visit I made was to see trouble in a different guise, not the\r\nwasting of incurable disease, nor the visitation of a hopeless malady,\r\nbut to see two men whose lives were being eaten away by the canker-worm\r\nof despair—Cetywayo and Langibalele! To those who have resided in South\r\nAfrica during the last twenty years these names will recall many an\r\nanxious time to colonists, brought about, in my humble opinion, not by\r\nthe desire of the colonists to do anything which was not legal and\r\nright—but in the first place by a want of tact in dealing with natives,\r\nand in the second from an uncontrollable infatuation seizing hold of\r\none, spreading like an epidemic to all. Not two years had passed since\r\n“Cetywayo” had been in every one’s mouth, and had been the hero of the\r\nhour. Again had Bishop Colenso come forward to see fair play done to one\r\nwhom he thought had been wrongly used, and again, as in Langibalele’s\r\ncase, had he gained for himself the ill-will of the colonists. I had\r\nformed a decided opinion about these cases and was naturally anxious to\r\nstudy the “fons et origo mali” of each complication, and accompanied by\r\nmy wife and various friends I paid Cetywayo several visits.\r\n\r\nThe drive of an hour in an open carriage, in such a climate as the Cape\r\npossesses on a fine winter afternoon, was pleasure enough to make even\r\nthe Cape flats and bad roads enjoyable. Upon these despised flats, in an\r\nold Dutch house, with the usual lofty and spacious rooms, which, however\r\ndesirable when adorned and well furnished, look gaunt and cheerless when\r\nneglected and empty, Cetywayo, the captive Zulu king, dragged out the\r\nweary days of his heart-breaking suspense. We were received by the king\r\nin a room that was bare save for a few chairs, and Cetywayo, a fine,\r\nlarge man, of dignified mien and sad, gentle expression, dressed in an\r\nill-cut blue serge suit, and sitting ill at ease in an arm chair, looked\r\na long way from being “at home.” He must have been a fine sight indeed\r\nin his royal kraal dressed in handsome umutye (tails, pronounced\r\nmoochas) when in the height of his pride and state.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion being accompanied by Mr. Saul Solomon, M. L. A. (and\r\n“negrophilist” as he was by some called on account of his sympathy with\r\nand advocacy of the rights of the native, but a man and politician who\r\nhad the welfare of his country as much at heart as the welfare of the\r\nnative), we found on our arrival at Oude Molen that the interpreter was\r\ntaking a walk, and a messenger was dispatched to call him. The king\r\nhaving evidently arranged himself to receive us, and growing impatient\r\nwith the delay, came to the door and asked why we did not enter, my wife\r\n(who could speak Zulu) replied, “we are waiting for the interpreter.”\r\nCetywayo answered, “what need for that when you can speak as well\r\nyourself,” and he insisted upon our entering then and there. Fortunately\r\nthe interpreter arrived almost at once, and we did not run the risk of\r\nbreaking any rule applying to visitors. Amongst other items of news we\r\nasked Cetywayo if he had learned from the newspapers (which he had\r\ntranslated to him every morning) that Mr. John Robinson (whom Cetywayo\r\nknew as a great supporter of Sir Bartle Frere) had been defeated in the\r\nelection for the Natal legislative council, where he had held a seat for\r\nmany years, when without speaking but uttering a soft pleased “Ah!” he\r\nshut his eyes, his face beamed, and passing his hand slowly across his\r\nmouth from one ear to the other, he gently drew in his breath as if\r\ndrinking a long draught of some divine nectar. The news evidently gave\r\nhim intense delight, and repeatedly jerking his thumb up and down he\r\nfeelingly exclaimed: “What had I done to this man to make him my enemy,\r\nI have never even seen him?” and waxing warmer, he added: “Yes, Sir\r\nBartle Frere is _down_ and John Robinson is _down_ too.”\r\n\r\nWe were told that Cetywayo enjoyed such visits as these, being a break\r\nin the monotony of his life. He was saved from vulgar curiosity by the\r\ngovernment not allowing any one to visit him without a special permit.\r\nWe found the women comprised in the household a great contrast to the\r\nquiet dignity of the king and his attendant chiefs; entering the room\r\nwhere they were at work making grass strainers and bead ornaments, they\r\nassailed us in loud, shrill voices, offering their wares for sale as if\r\nnothing more serious were on hand, being as keen to drive a good bargain\r\nas any professional peddler—it had not taken them long to learn the\r\nvalue of “filthy lucre.”\r\n\r\nWalking on a few hundred yards we came next to the abode of a man who\r\neight years before had set Natal in a blaze, had aroused the chivalrous\r\nfeelings of its unswerving bishop, and had been the cause of its\r\nlieutenant governor’s recall!\r\n\r\nLangibalele, or “the bright shining sun,” the cause of all this, we\r\nfound sitting on the trunk of a tree at the side of a brick-built\r\ncottage, shading himself from the sun. Of middle height, blear-eyed,\r\nold, decrepit and almost in rags, he formed a sorry contrast to the\r\ndignified majesty of Cetywayo, whom we had just left.\r\n\r\nI called to my recollection how, ignoring the orders of Sir Benjamin\r\nPine, he had decamped[76] with his tribe and cattle over the Drakensberg\r\ninto the Double Mountains of Basutoland, instead of answering a summons\r\nto come to Pietermaritzburg to explain the reason why the young men of\r\nhis tribe had refused to register their guns; how made a prisoner by\r\nJonathan Molappo, a Basuto chief, he was sentenced to convict labor for\r\nlife and transported to Robben Island, and how Bishop Colenso, braving\r\nthe prejudices of the Natal colonists, went to England, in the cause of\r\njustice and humanity, and exposed the whole matter,[77] that\r\nLangibalele’s sentence was reduced to twenty years’ safe custody on the\r\nmainland, and Sir B. Pine was recalled![78]\r\n\r\nShortly after parliament was prorogued Cetywayo had his heart’s desire\r\ngratified by being summoned to England, where his restoration to\r\nZululand having been determined upon, the English government had thought\r\nit would be advisable to let him see some of the wonders of civilization\r\nbefore he resumed his power. The king was placed in the charge of Mr.\r\nHenrique Shepstone, a good Zulu linguist, and son of Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone, who was formerly secretary for native affairs in Natal.\r\nCetywayo heroically bore the long sea voyage, being determined to leave\r\nno stone unturned by which he might possibly regain his forfeited\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nIt may interest some to hear of him in London, so I will quote from a\r\nletter my wife’s description of a visit she paid to him as she passed\r\nthrough that city on her way to New York:\r\n\r\n  “I have just returned from making a call upon Cetywayo; it was a\r\n  temptation after seeing him in his wretched Oude Molen quarters, just\r\n  before I left Capetown, and knowing so well how he lived in his own\r\n  uncivilized fashion, to see how he would look in a London\r\n  drawing-room. Mr. Jonathan Peel was good enough to see our old friend,\r\n  Mr. Henrique Shepstone, who is the special envoy in charge, and he\r\n  most kindly arranged our visit.\r\n\r\n  “On our arrival we were received by Cetywayo with evident pleasure,\r\n  who, seating himself on a sofa, waived us to chairs arranged in a\r\n  circle before him. The three chiefs who had accompanied him were each\r\n  seated in a corner of the room. One chief appeared to have three feet,\r\n  as he had taken off one of his boots and carefully arranged it in line\r\n  with his two feet—explaining to me in a tone of apology, that in\r\n  walking the day before it had blistered his little toe. The poor\r\n  fellows looked uncomfortable enough in European clothes, but there was\r\n  no reason why they should have been rendered more ridiculous by\r\n  wearing neckties with embroidered red rosebuds. Fancy sad, dignified\r\n  Cetywayo with a red rosebud under his chin!\r\n\r\n  “Cetywayo opened the conversation by asking me how I came to be in\r\n  London. I replied I had come as he had by steamer, and that I was\r\n  shortly going further, to America, and I suggested that after he had\r\n  seen England he should pay my country a visit. He looked at me, sadly\r\n  shaking his head, and said: ‘I should not be here, were it not that I\r\n  am as I am.’ I thought this answer for quiet dignity was simply\r\n  perfect; it sounded even better in his beautiful Zulu than it does as\r\n  I have translated it for you. Of course I could not allow him to dwell\r\n  upon so painful a subject as his captivity, so I asked him if he had\r\n  been much interested in the sights of London. Mr. Shepstone slyly\r\n  remarked that the king was very anxious to see the German giantess on\r\n  exhibition at the Alhambra, and that he expected to be altogether\r\n  captivated. Cetywayo turned the joke by saying—‘he just says that\r\n  about me, because he is in love with her himself.’ This fairly\r\n  ‘brought down the house,’ and literally too, as Mr. Shepstone’s chair\r\n  gave way under him at that moment, and this added to the general\r\n  amusement. Cetywayo seeing a jet bracelet on Miss G.’s arm inquired\r\n  the name of it, and declared his intention to take some ‘ujet’\r\n  ornaments back as presents for his wives. It struck me rather as\r\n  ‘taking coals to Newcastle,’ as far as color went; but evidently his\r\n  taste is neat, not gaudy. Cetywayo, growing restless, walked toward\r\n  the window, when a shout from the crowd outside made him suddenly draw\r\n  back, upon which one of the chiefs remarked, with the utmost disgust\r\n  in his tones: ‘There they stand, from daylight till long after\r\n  nightfall, and we don’t know what they want.’ Mr. Shepstone told us\r\n  that at first Cetywayo was inclined to be very angry, deeming it great\r\n  rudeness, but he had explained it to him that it was the delight they\r\n  felt in seeing a ‘King,’ and this had somewhat appeased the poor\r\n  captive. Mr. Shepstone now proposed that ‘the King’ should graciously\r\n  indulge the people outside by returning to the window—which Cetywayo\r\n  did, looking as if he felt they were making a fool of him, took off\r\n  his smoking cap, and waited patiently while the crowd gaped and\r\n  shouted ‘Hurrah!’ Shortly after this we left. Poor Cetywayo’s intense\r\n  sadness, even when he laughed, made me feel quite sorry for him, even\r\n  in spite of myself. You know I have never agreed with your absolute\r\n  bearing toward his side of the Zulu war question. The friends who were\r\n  with me, though biased against Cetywayo, admitted, after seeing him,\r\n  that their feelings had become considerably modified.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CETYWAYO]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the Zulu war has been worn thread-bare by each party, for\r\nand against, from their own standpoint. Mr. John Dunn’s book is the last\r\nray of light cast upon it. I shall not weary my readers by entering into\r\nthe matter at any great length, but, as it were, take my stand between\r\nthe two parties and express my humble opinion as a colonist of\r\ntwenty-two years’ standing, and as one who has learned to appreciate and\r\nfeel a sincere affection for the native. No one is really competent to\r\njudge this question, who does not understand—1st. The native character\r\nand the strictness of their etiquette in the reverence shown to\r\nsuperiors, breaches of which are no less important signs of troubles\r\nbrewing than is the “small, black cloud, no larger than a man’s hand,”\r\nwhich precedes a storm, and—2nd. The defenceless state—indeed, the caged\r\nanimal helplessness, of the Natal colonists. The Zulu appetite for\r\n“eating up”[79] was there without a doubt; Cetywayo having asked\r\npermission of the Natal government to “eat up” the Swazis. What more\r\nnatural than that the colonists should fear that this unsatisfied\r\nappetite might be otherwise appeased upon the slightest provocation, and\r\nwhat could be more aggravating to the spirit of a proud, self-willed\r\nZulu king, than the restraints civilization was seeking to impose upon\r\nhim? The last two Zulu kings had been shrewd enough to see the\r\nadvantages and protection which friendly relations with the English\r\ngovernment afforded them, against their natural enemies, the Boers, with\r\ntheir grab-all policy. For this friendship and moral support, John Bull,\r\nof course, required some compensation—the abolition of cruelties toward\r\nZulu subjects by their king, and the insuring of the safety of the Natal\r\ncolonists, he thought not too much to demand. Alas! had there been a\r\n“Chinese Gordon” to tie what might have proved a gordian knot of mutual\r\nfriendship and protection, all would have been well. But what happened?\r\nWho can take the responsibility of fixing blame upon any one individual,\r\nwhen so many “cooks” were engaged in “spoiling the broth,” either by\r\nomission or commission? Frere, Shepstone, Cetywayo, Dunn, Bulwer,\r\nColenso and John Robinson, with his newspaper. It must be admitted that\r\nCetywayo’s character was the natural result of inherited tendency. The\r\nabsolute power, the custom of cold-blooded murders for trivial offenses,\r\nor rather, _when convenient_, suspected offenses, the immense standing\r\narmy, the longing for wars and “dipping of assegais in blood,”[80] added\r\nto the haughty self-will and the insecurity of the position of an\r\nirresponsible despot, which a Zulu king enjoys, all made Cetywayo what\r\nhe was, a neighbor to be feared.\r\n\r\nWho shall bear the blame of the irritation caused Cetywayo by the\r\n“impudent behavior of messengers” sent to him by the Natal government,\r\nor the growing anger he felt toward the government and its messengers,\r\non account of their “assuming authority not recognized by him”? I quote\r\nfrom Mr. Dunn’s book, who also says, Cetywayo despatched messengers with\r\na letter to the Natal government stating his wish to go against the\r\nAmaswazi, and to this he received the following document:\r\n\r\n  “Reply of his excellency Sir Benjamin Chilley Campbell Pine, K.C.M.G.,\r\n        lieutenant governor of Natal, to Cetywayo, chief of the Zulu\r\n        nation.\r\n\r\n                        “OFFICE OF SECRETARY FOR NATIVE AFFAIRS,\r\n                                                        “Oct. 22d, 1874.\r\n\r\n“The lieutenant governor has received the letter sent by Cetywayo, and\r\nthe reasons given for making war upon the Amaswazi.\r\n\r\n“The lieutenant governor sees no cause whatever for making war, and\r\ninforms Cetywayo that such an intention on the part of the Zulus meets\r\nwith his entire disapproval.\r\n\r\n“Cetywayo must also remember that the Amaswazi are almost entirely\r\nsurrounded by white people who have settled in the country, and it will\r\nbe impossible for the Zulus, if war is made, to avoid getting into\r\ndifficulties with them.\r\n\r\n“Many years ago the lieutenant governor sent a letter to the late King\r\nM’Pande, requesting him to allow the Amaswazi to live in peace from any\r\nfurther attacks of the Zulus; he promised to do so, and has kept his\r\nword.\r\n\r\n“The lieutenant governor trusts that what he has said will be sufficient\r\nto deter Cetywayo and the Zulu nation from entertaining such a project.\r\n\r\n                     “By command of his excellency,\r\n\r\n “(Signed)\r\n\r\n                          “J. W. SHEPSTONE,\r\n                                  “Acting Secretary for Native Affairs.”\r\n\r\nAnd John Dunn adds: “The above letter made the king change his plans,\r\nalthough it enraged him, as I could plainly see.” Again John Dunn says:\r\n“From this time the tone of Cetywayo toward the English government began\r\nto change, and I could see, from the constant secret meetings which took\r\nplace, that his intention was to make war somewhere; but I did not for a\r\nmoment believe it was his intention to fight against the English,\r\nalthough I could see that he was greatly exasperated at the tone of the\r\ngovernment, assuming an authority over him that he did not think they\r\nhad a right to do.”\r\n\r\nThen if we consider the refusal of Cetywayo to give up the men who made\r\na raid into Natal (see appendix, ultimatum, clause 10, etc.), but\r\ninstead was busy massing his warriors, and further, the recollection\r\nstill fresh in the memory of all (when my own father-in-law had to fly\r\nfor his life), how Cetywayo’s uncles, Tchaka and Dingaan, had swept\r\nNatal time after time, until “before Tchaka was killed” by his brother\r\nDingaan, “he was supposed to have destroyed a million of human beings,”\r\nwho will blame the anxiety of the colonists, especially when at this\r\ntime the native tribes in the Cape Colony and Griqualand West were all\r\nengaged in rebellion against the English government?\r\n\r\nThe next factor in this war was the annexation of the Transvaal by the\r\nEnglish government, professedly as a protection against the natives. The\r\nland dispute between the Transvaal and Cetywayo (see appendix, ultimatum\r\nclause, 3 to 10) had to be taken with the republic, and now the task of\r\nappeasing both parties in the matter was more than any government could\r\npossibly accomplish. The delay in settling the disputed land question\r\nhad led to an impatient act on Cetywayo’s part (see appendix, ultimatum,\r\nclause 4). The English government, knowing well all the weary years of\r\nwaiting which Cetywayo had borne, might well overlook this action; but\r\nwhen it did at last appoint a commission to settle the question,\r\nCetywayo received a part only of the land he claimed.\r\n\r\nWhether the idea was right or wrong, that now the Transvaal had been\r\nannexed the view taken by the government was changed by self-interest,\r\nit is no less a fact that Cetywayo was disappointed, and fresh fuel had\r\nbeen added to his disaffection.\r\n\r\nAt this time Sir Bartle Frere had come upon the scene, confederation\r\nbeing his mission. The danger of an army of trained warriors, 50,000\r\nstrong, at the command of an uncivilized king, on the very border of\r\nlittle Natal, was a very great obstacle; and considering Cetywayo’s\r\nsullen attitude, what colony in its senses would agree to be\r\nconfederated with a little colony having such a danger upon its borders?\r\nTime can never prove whether Sir Bartle Frere’s judgment was right or\r\nwrong in sending the ultimatum and outrageous demands to Cetywayo which\r\nforced the war upon him.\r\n\r\nThere was one man, Mr. John Dunn, who _might_ from his thorough\r\nknowledge of the Zulus have averted this war; unfortunately his attempt\r\nwas delayed until too late, (See appendix—John Dunn’s letter to the\r\nAborigines’ Protection Society). In Mr. Dunn’s book,[81] which is very\r\ninteresting reading, he does not tell us of any effort he made with the\r\nNatal government to prevent the war, and one cannot help wishing that he\r\nhad gone earnestly and unceasingly to work, both with the English\r\ngovernment and Cetywayo, with that persistency which surely tells in a\r\ngood cause. Possibly John Dunn did not realize the situation in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CETYWAYO’S WAGON CROSSING THE INPOLOGI RIVER, ZULULAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe recollections of Isandhlwana, Zhlobane and Ulundi make one’s blood\r\nrun cold; but terrible as this war was, the cruelty and wickedness of\r\nhaving brought it about, could time prove it to have been unnecessary,\r\ncannot compare, in my mind, with the cruelty and wickedness of the\r\ndisastrous Zulu settlement by Sir Garnet Wolseley and the after neglect\r\nof the Zulu nation by the English government. It was “adding insult to\r\ninjury” to place these people under petty chiefs, and the whole nation\r\nbecame demoralized. They _would_ have respected their conquered king\r\neven if he had had to accede to all the demands of the ultimatum and to\r\nowe allegiance to the English government, and they _could_ have accepted\r\na conquering power more especially when that power was the marvelous\r\nEnglish. This latter disposition is what they naturally would have\r\nexpected. But to place them under petty chiefs was just to set them\r\nagain at the old game of one chief “eating up” another until one became\r\nsupreme. When at last Cetywayo was restored it was simple cruelty not to\r\nhave established him firmly and protected him from all danger. Sad\r\nindeed would Bishop Colenso have been had he lived to see the\r\nrestoration of Cetywayo for which he worked so earnestly. It was poor\r\n“justice” that left the king, having destroyed his power, to the mercy\r\nof his enemies, and to die very shortly from poison or a broken heart!\r\nNo one could have expected Cetywayo to resume his old footing among his\r\npeople through any love they bore him. What does any native chief ever\r\ndo to make himself beloved? The Zulus possess a dog-like fidelity toward\r\ntheir chiefs, and they may be proud of their conquests, but when we\r\nconsider that Cetywayo could hold his position by the utmost severity\r\nonly, ruling by fear rather than love, we cannot be surprised that his\r\nrestoration without support was an utter failure. Even upon Cetywayo’s\r\ndeath it would not have been too late for England to annex the Zulus and\r\naccept a noble mission. With the natural fidelity of the Zulus, how easy\r\na matter, with firm, kind rule, to gain their love as well!\r\n\r\nWhat a field for civilization and Christianity! Supposing a governor had\r\nbeen appointed, laws made to keep the Zulu country for the Zulus, and\r\nlaws also for their moral good, such as no spirituous liquors allowed,\r\netc., what might not have been made of them? What is the consequence of\r\nthis shirking of responsibility? As Cetywayo received no material\r\nsupport from England his son and successor was foolish enough to appeal\r\nfor help to his father’s old enemies, the covetous Boers, who true to\r\ntheir nature have managed to gain possession of the better half of\r\nZululand, and nothing has been done for the improvement or benefit of\r\nthat grand Zulu nation—the war has brought them ruin only, when it might\r\nso easily have resulted in good. England in shirking this responsibility\r\nappears to me in the same cruel, sinful light as a mother who leaves her\r\nhelpless, illegitimate babe on the door-step of a stranger.[82]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV.\r\n VISIT TO BASUTOLAND.—PITSO AT MASERU.—INTERVIEW WITH MASUPHA.—GENERAL\r\n  GORDON’S APPOINTMENT.—PITSO AT LERIBE.—ROMA.—THE ROMAN CATHOLIC AND\r\n         PROTESTANT MISSIONS.—MAFETING.—EAST LONDON.—SIR DAVID\r\n      WEDDERBURN.—ARRIVAL IN CAPETOWN.—CAPE ASSEMBLY RESIGNATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time before the opening of the fourth session of parliament in\r\n1882, in course of correspondence with the Hon. Colonel Schermbrucker,\r\nM. L. C. for King William’s Town, I proposed to him that before\r\nparliament met we should make a tour through Basutoland, and see for\r\nourselves the real position of affairs and the condition of the country,\r\nespecially as so many conflicting statements were afloat. We agreed to\r\nmeet at Maseru on March 1st, 1882. Determined that this appointment\r\nshould be kept to the day, I left Kimberley at noon on Feb. 26th for\r\nBloemfontein, _en route_ to Basutoland.\r\n\r\nArriving at Boshof, a rising Free State town, in about six hours, we\r\nchanged horses, and proceeding on our journey spent the whole of a\r\ndelightful summer night, which a brilliant moon lit up as light as day,\r\nin speeding over the plains of the Free State. But what torture we\r\nsuffered between this place and Bloemfontein! The wagonette in which we\r\nrode was sadly out of repair, and I thought myself lucky in getting the\r\nback seat, but, alas! being also the lid of a box, the hinges of which\r\nwere broken, it was misplaced by any sudden jolt, so I found myself as\r\noften in the box as out of it.\r\n\r\nI had not seen the neat little town of Bloemfontein for ten years, but I\r\nfound it had not developed much during this interim. My previous errand\r\nhad been of a very different kind. Then the whole of the state was in\r\npainful suspense on account of the critical state in which their\r\npresident, Mr. (now Sir John) Brand, was lying. The executive, fearing\r\nthe worst, determined to obtain further medical opinion upon his case,\r\nand sent to Kimberley for Dr. Dyer, a leading practitioner there, and\r\nmyself, to post over with all speed. Our consultation with the\r\npresident’s physicians was not hopeful, and we left, expecting the\r\nworst; however, some days after our return we learned that the disease\r\nhad taken a favorable turn, and we had the satisfaction in a few mails\r\nto hear of the president’s gradual restoration to health.\r\n\r\nDuring the few hours that I rested at Bloemfontein I had the pleasure of\r\nmeeting his honor again, older and greyer certainly than he was ten\r\nyears before, but looking full of health and vigor, “his age like a\r\nlusty winter, frosty but kindly.” He was sitting in his private room in\r\nthe magnificent block of government buildings erected lately by the\r\nstate. On introduction, he recognized me at once, spoke feelingly of the\r\npast when last we met, and asked me to dinner, an invitation which I was\r\nunable to accept, owing to my previous appointment with Colonel\r\nSchermbrucker on the first of March, which I had barely time enough to\r\nkeep. I started the same afternoon in a special cart for Ladybrand, and\r\ntraveled again the whole of the night. After “moving accidents by flood\r\nand field,” overturning the cart, losing the mules, getting wet through\r\nand nearly drowned in the Modder River, I at last outspanned for a\r\ncouple of hours at Modderpoort, ten miles from Ladybrand, a mission\r\nstation conducted by members of the Anglican brotherhood, who had been\r\nsettled there since 1870. Father Douglas, the present head of the\r\ncommunity, kindly showed me round the mission station. I saw the pretty\r\nstone church with its stained glass windows and solemn aisles, and the\r\nsubstantial mission house for the priests, but that which interested me\r\nmost was the sight of the cave at the bottom of the garden in which\r\nduring the early years of the mission Father Beckett, the founder, used\r\nto live. This good old priest, after years of arduous work, was called\r\nto his rest last year (in 1884), regretted by the whole country side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MASERU, BASUTOLAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBidding farewell to Father Douglas I reached Ladybrand at 6 P. M. “All’s\r\nwell that ends well,” a good rest and sleep enabled me to start early\r\nnext morning for Maseru, escorted by a well-known Basuto head man named\r\nMakolokolo, who with an escort of ten men had come to meet me. The\r\nscenery between Ladybrand and Maseru is magnificent, the mountains, with\r\nthe grassy plains rolling between, to one who for years had seen nothing\r\nbut heaps of diamond debris and tailings from washing machines seemed\r\ninexpressibly and over-poweringly grand. As we rode on to the drift of\r\nthe Caledon we passed a long range of hills, where I saw the first signs\r\nof the war that had been raging. By faint curls of smoke high up the\r\nhillsides, mounting in the air, my attention was drawn to the presence\r\nof a number of refugee Basuto women and children living ensconced in\r\ncaves, who had received permission from the Free State government to\r\nsquat there pending the settlement of affairs.\r\n\r\nGalloping quickly on, at ten o’clock I arrived at the drift of the\r\nCaledon River crossing to Maseru. I found the river running in torrents,\r\nthe pont or horse ferry, damaged the day before, unworkable—in fact the\r\nlate heavy rains had upset everything, but there, on the other side of\r\nthe river, exact to the day and hour fixed months before, I could see my\r\nfriend, the colonel, waiting. A hearty shout of recognition and welcome\r\ngreeted me, and jumping into a boat I was safely landed on the other\r\nside, in Basutoland.\r\n\r\nOur progress to Maseru from the Caledon River, about a mile, was one\r\ntriumphal procession. As members of the Cape parliament who, the loyals\r\nknew by report, sympathized with their sufferings, Colonel Schermbrucker\r\nand myself were heartily welcomed by these poor broken-hearted people.\r\nThey regarded us as men who would be able from personal knowledge and\r\ninspection to bring their cruel wrongs and sufferings before parliament,\r\nreveal their exact condition, and show the world, at least the South\r\nAfrican world, the sad plight and the miserable state in which their\r\nloyalty and their belief in the flag of Old England had landed them.\r\n\r\nHundreds met us on the banks of the river; the crowd, “lumelaing”\r\n(saluting) us and singing and dancing their war dances, and increasing\r\nin numbers until our arrival at Mr. Trower’s store when we arranged with\r\nthe leaders to have a meeting or _pitso_ in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nMaseru is a prettily situated village just on the confines of\r\nBasutoland, and during the war was an important rendezvous and depot. By\r\ngood fortune I found an old brother, if not in arms in lancets, Dr.\r\nCumming, stationed here, who invited me to accompany him to the camp of\r\nthe Cape mounted rifles, when I spent a pleasant hour lunching with him\r\nand other members of the staff.\r\n\r\nA splendid view of Maseru and the surrounding country is obtained from\r\nthe high plain on which the camp was pitched.\r\n\r\nFrom our open dining tent I could see on one side the winding Caledon,\r\nrushing along in torrents, on the other the grassy plain with the camp\r\nand its surroundings, whilst in front, below us, lay the pretty village\r\nof Maseru with its houses and stores, its trees and its gardens, and the\r\nresidency which a short time before had witnessed a most plucky and\r\nsuccessful defence against the attacking hordes of Masupha’s rebels. As\r\na background to this lovely scene, three hills nicknamed by our troops,\r\n“the world, the flesh and the devil” completed the picture.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there was a large meeting of the loyal Basutos, and we\r\nheard from their own lips the story of their sufferings. Among the\r\nspeakers was Sofonia Moshesh, whose magnificently built stone house I\r\nafterward saw in the distance when going to Thaba Bosigo, Makolokolo, a\r\nclever, far-seeing man, whose opinion was much thought of by the\r\nBasutos, Inodi, Jacob Matseke, N’tsane Moshesh, whose house surrounded\r\nby a forest of 2,000 gum trees is a sight ever to be remembered. The\r\nenthralled attention and eager anxiety of the assembly struck me very\r\nmuch, and it was impossible not to feel for men like Sofonia Moshesh and\r\nN’tsane Moshesh who had lost everything by their loyalty to the\r\ngovernment. but who still trusted, still “hoped on” that justice would\r\nbe done them.\r\n\r\nThe petition which was to be presented to parliament setting forth their\r\ngrievances, and praying the house to allow three chiefs they had chosen\r\nto appear as their spokesmen at the bar of the house, was signed by all\r\npresent, and the pitso broke up with loud cheers for the Queen.\r\n\r\nAfter the pitso was over I walked up with Colonel Schermbrucker to the\r\nresidency, saw how the place had been stormed and riddled by bullets on\r\nthe day of the memorable attack on November 20th, 1880, and then went to\r\nsee the accommodation provided for the “loyals,” of which we had heard\r\nso much. Tents all tattered and torn, affording no shelter from either\r\nthe wind or weather, we found were the only housing provided for these\r\nloyal natives, who by obeying the orders of the government had been\r\nrendered destitute, robbed of their cattle, driven from their gardens\r\nand their fields, from house and home! We came away impressed with the\r\nfact that the conception formed by our loyal friends of England’s\r\njustice and power must be very mythical indeed.[83] Richard Brinsley\r\nSheridan’s graphic and powerful description of the condition into which\r\nthe province of Oude was brought by the emissaries of Warren Hastings is\r\nexceedingly applicable to the condition in which we found these deluded\r\npeople. Well could they also say “this damp of death is the mere\r\neffusion of British amity! We sink under the pressure of their\r\nsupport!... They have embraced us with their protecting arms, and lo,\r\nthese are the fruits of their alliance!”\r\n\r\nNext day we rode through Ladybrand to Ficksburg, a distance of sixty\r\nmiles, accompanied by Makolokolo and some ten mounted men. Arriving\r\nlate, after a hard day’s ride through a country not at all interesting,\r\nwe rested the night, having previously arranged to meet the chief,\r\nJonathan (the late chief Molappo’s son), and his people at Leribe on the\r\nfollowing day. Starting early next morning, we were met on this side of\r\nthe Caledon drift by 200 of Jonathan’s men on horseback sent to escort\r\nus to Thlotsi Heights, the seat of the magistracy, and the place where\r\nhundreds of his men (loyals), driven from their homes by the rebel\r\nBasutos (like those whom we saw at Maseru), were squatting together\r\ndepending on the government for food and protection.[84] Crossing the\r\nCaledon, the chief Jonathan met us, and Colonel Schermbrucker introduced\r\nme to him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MOLAPPO’S HOUSE, NEAR LERIBE, BASUTOLAND.—INTERVIEW WITH LOYAL\r\n    BASUTOS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis chief is a noble specimen of the Mosuto, not very tall, but well\r\nmade, though slightly stout, and with an intelligent and frank\r\nexpression of countenance. He was attired in the undress uniform of a\r\nBritish officer and magnificently mounted. He conducted us to his house\r\nat Thlotsi Heights, where we had coffee and rested about an hour, when\r\nwe started for Leribe. I shall never forget my ride. The whole of the\r\nBasutos who were at Thlotsi Heights joined us, every one mounted.\r\nJonathan provided horses for Colonel Schermbrucker and myself, and we\r\nrode in front, Colonel Schermbrucker on one side, I on the other, the\r\nchief in the middle, with a cavalcade of at least 500 mounted men\r\nbehind. The morning was bright and cheery, the air seemed charged with\r\nelectric freshness, the grassy turf was like a spring-board, so never\r\ndrawing rein, we raced along to Leribe, doing the nine miles in forty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nOn arrival I was astonished at what I saw; we off-saddled in front of\r\ntwo large stone houses,[85] built about ten years ago by Molappo, one\r\nfor his white visitors, the other for his own use. The accompanying view\r\nI took at the time. The interior was beautifully furnished, and even\r\npictures graced the walls, and this right in the heart of Basutoland,\r\nwhere civilization was supposed to have scarcely penetrated.\r\n\r\nWe rested a short time, were then invited to partake of what was really\r\na fine dinner, after which we spoke to the large gathering of Basutos\r\nwho had assembled to meet us, and listened to their mournful story, when\r\nafter signing the petition[86] for me to present to parliament, the\r\nmeeting broke up by singing the national anthem.\r\n\r\nMr. Maitin, the son of a much esteemed French missionary who interpreted\r\nfor me, took at the time full notes of what the different speakers said.\r\nAll their observations were to the point, and the quaint manner in which\r\nthey were put well illustrated the shrewdness of the Basuto character,\r\nevidently wishing to imply only, amidst the tale of all their cruel\r\nsufferings, the one fact ever brought to the fore, “civis Anglicanus\r\nsum.” These notes he afterward sent to the Cape _Times_, from which\r\npaper I make a few extracts.\r\n\r\nAfter giving some introductory remarks which I made to the large\r\nassembly, Mr. Maitin proceeds to report more _in extenso_ what fell from\r\nthe different natives of standing present.\r\n\r\nPiet Makolokolo (to whom I have already referred as a man much trusted\r\nby the loyals), Sofonia, Kampa, Jacob Moseki, and other prominent men\r\ntold their tale of suffering and neglect. Koadi’s and N’tsane Moshesh’s\r\nspeeches, however, I give in full, as they contain the gist of what the\r\nother speakers said.\r\n\r\nKoadi said: “I am very glad to see Dr. Matthews amongst us, and I was\r\nglad when he came to Maseru. I am very thirsty and I believe he can help\r\nin quenching my thirst. In short, I will state I agree entirely with\r\nwhat has been said by Sofonia, and with the petition which has just been\r\nread to us. We approve of what it contains. I ask you loyals if we speak\r\ntruth in that petition? Your answer is ‘Yes.’ I will be short, as time\r\nis pressing. We are now in great misery. We are men who cried out to\r\nthose in power to do something for us. Now I ask what are they going to\r\ndo? I fully agree with Sofonia; he is right in saying the loyals are all\r\ncrying, suffering, and in misery for their loyalty. He is right in\r\nsaying before the rebellion we were rich, free, and independent, but now\r\nare poor and suffering.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday some of my men came to me and complained of the bad tents,\r\nwhich do not afford shelter from the rain and cold, and reproached me\r\nwith having persuaded them to follow the government. I do not say for a\r\nmoment we have been wrong to remain faithful to the government. We all\r\nknow that we received the Queen’s government from the hands of Moshesh,\r\nand as far as I am concerned I will be faithful to the government till\r\nthe government casts me off. I have still, even now, great faith and\r\nhope, as I see a member of parliament amongst us, which proves to me\r\nthat the colony will see us righted. As Sofonia says, we were killed\r\nbecause we were faithful. Must we die again? I hope if the first doctor\r\nfails the second will cure us. I think our petition contains all we\r\nwanted to say.”\r\n\r\nQuestion from Dr. Matthews: “What has Koadi lost?” “I have only lost\r\nfive head of cattle, taken from the Free State, but my people lost\r\ncattle and horses. My great loss is one greater than any amount of\r\ncattle, and that is my ground and my rights. Those who rebelled fought\r\nbecause they wanted the right of the ground, which I have lost, and\r\nwhich is my great loss. As a grandson of Moshesh I had rights and lands,\r\nwith which I could do as I liked. When we were told about disarmament,\r\nbefore the rebellion, and were ordered to give up our guns, I came three\r\ntimes to Colonel Griffith, and told him I did not wish to separate\r\nmyself from my gun, and he answered me by taking the Peace Preservation\r\nact, and saying, this is the law. I did not like to give up my gun, but\r\nI obeyed the law. Mr. Sprigg then came to Basutoland, and when Colonel\r\nGriffith informed us he was here I went to see him, and Colonel Griffith\r\nintroduced me to the then colonial secretary; he asked me to state what\r\nI had lost, and he said that my property should be restored, and that\r\nthe governor would protect my life and property. I will not relate how\r\nwe were nearly destroyed, as Colonel Schermbrucker, who was our\r\ncommandant, can witness on Oct. 20th, 1880; he has remained faithful to\r\nus during all our troubles. We hear it is peace, but we do not see it. I\r\nam glad Dr. Matthews took the trouble to come to us. I want to show him\r\nour food (an old biscuit was here produced); this is the food the\r\ngovernment gives us, the government which promised us protection; we are\r\noften sick after eating this provision. The government was not able to\r\nprotect us last year, so during the war we were well fed, but now this\r\nis the description of food we receive. I should like Dr. Matthews to\r\ntake a walk and see our houses, huts and tents, and the manner in which\r\nwe are now living, and, if he could go and see our old homes, villages,\r\netc., and compare them. When you do compare them you will know who are\r\nthe people who have suffered much, and what they have suffered. During\r\nthe war the rebels did not suffer, because they had all our property and\r\neverything they wanted; they are still now the masters of the country,\r\nand of our property. We have been in this state of destitution for two\r\nyears. Many of the present people are chiefs, but they are so badly\r\ndressed that you could take them for common people, and this is one of\r\nthe results of their loyalty. It is a great pity that Dr. Matthews has\r\nnot more time to spare, otherwise every one could speak to him. I blame\r\nMr. Sprigg for our condition, because he made us promises, but it was\r\nnot his fault if they were not carried out, because he had to go out of\r\noffice; it was for his successors to fulfill those promises. I again\r\nthank Dr. Matthews for all his attention.”\r\n\r\nN’tsane Moshesh followed in the same strain: “I greet Dr. Matthews and\r\nall the loyals. I cannot say how thankful I am that he has taken the\r\ntrouble to come and see those men who remained faithful to the Queen.\r\nMoshesh handed over to the Queen his country and people, and here are\r\nthe few people who remained faithful. I thank Dr. Matthews for coming\r\nhere to see our miseries and to ascertain the true state of affairs. I\r\nendorse every word stated by Sofonia and Koadi. I have nothing to add.\r\nThe petition contains the substance of our feelings, and every word of\r\nit is true, and I have only to thank Dr. Matthews for his trouble. I do\r\nnot want him to think that because we are black we have no feelings. It\r\nis perfectly true what Koadi said—that we deceive our people, for they\r\nask us now: ‘Where is the protection of the government?’ Another thing\r\nis, we speak only for Maseru, no loyal has been able to return to his\r\nhome. Sofonia, Lefoyane, Koadi and myself were the first who said we\r\nwould go back to our homes—we were anxious to do so, because we valued\r\nthem. I went to my village according to Mr. Orpen’s[87] order, and found\r\nall my land divided between Theko Letsie and Mama Letsie; and who\r\ndivided thus my property? who, but the man who calls himself the head of\r\nthe loyals, Letsea, my brother! As it is stated, in the petition my\r\nground, etc., cannot be valued in money, and I will never accept money\r\nas compensation. Cattle, horses, etc., are nothing, but to lose my\r\nrights as a chief grieves me. In cattle I lost 370 head—government gave\r\nme three! Every one knows how my village was planted with blue gum\r\ntrees; there were 1,862 trees beside houses and other property, and now\r\nI live in a tent. I cannot state all that I would like to say as time is\r\nso pressing.”\r\n\r\nAfter finishing this speech, all the Basutos, as I mentioned before,\r\nsigned the petition, and I closed this most interesting interview by a\r\nfew words of encouragement, to which Koadi, in the name of all present,\r\nreplied: “I return thanks to Dr. Matthews for the loyals, and I am glad\r\nto hear there is hope of justice for them in the breast of Englishmen.\r\nWe have heard of Moses, but we have no Moses, but perhaps you will be\r\nour Moses, and deliver us out of Egypt.”\r\n\r\nThe pitso being ended I rode back to Thlotse Heights, and bidding\r\n“good-bye” to Colonel Schermbrucker, who went to Ladybrand, I spent the\r\nnight at the house of Dr. Taylor, the government surgeon. In the morning\r\nthe chief Jonathan came to see me. We had a long talk on Basutoland\r\naffairs, and on leaving he presented me with a valuable pony as a\r\nmemento of my visit. I left for Ficksburg next day and pushed through to\r\nMaseru, where I arrived late at night.\r\n\r\nBefore taking my trip to Leribe to interview Jonathan and his people I\r\nwrote a letter “greeting” to Masupha, asking him to grant me an\r\naudience, and also leave to visit “Thaba Bosigo” (the mountain of\r\nnight), where he was living. On my return I found a message waiting me\r\nfrom Masupha, giving me the requested permission, and saying that he\r\nwould be glad to see me. So early on the following morning (March 7th) I\r\nleft Maseru with a native escort under Koadi, a grandson of Moshesh,\r\npassing the Berea on my left, which was the scene of the terrible\r\ndisaster which befell Gen. Sir George Cathcart, then governor of the\r\nCape Colony and high commissioner, in 1852, of which the following is a\r\nbrief outline:\r\n\r\nThe general, at the instance of Mr. Commissioner Owen, then in the\r\nsovereignty (now the Free State), had advanced in November of that year\r\nwith some 2,000 troops as far as the Berea to demand of Moshesh 10,000\r\nhead of cattle and 1,000 horses for not complying with an award of Major\r\nWarden’s forbidding him to cross over the border line between Basutoland\r\nand the sovereignty under penalty of giving offense to the Queen and\r\nincurring a severe penalty.\r\n\r\nWith the troops he had with him (Colonel Hare of the 73d regiment)\r\ntaking the advance command, Sir George ascended the Berea mountain, the\r\ntop of which forms a large plateau, in three places, to attack that\r\nwonderfully astute barbarian and punish him for breaking his agreement.\r\nThere was a heavy mist on the mountain at the time, and our men\r\nmistaking the Basutos for so many cattle, on discovering their error\r\nfled panic-stricken. Some in retreating jumped over precipices in the\r\nmountains and were killed, while the others who escaped continued their\r\nflight far into the night to Platberg in the sovereignty. More than one\r\nhundred officers and men lost their lives on this occasion, and it is\r\nsaid that the general never returned to bury their bodies, this\r\nmelancholy office being performed by the missionaries in the\r\nneighborhood. Moshesh, next day, diplomatic enough, was profuse in his\r\nexcuses for the attack, and sent cattle as a token of his submission,\r\nwhich General Cathcart was only too glad to accept.\r\n\r\nGoing a little further I passed Boquatie, a curious village of people\r\nwho came from the Vaal River in 1833, and at noon I arrived at the\r\nFrench Protestant mission station of the Rev. M. Jousse, situated in a\r\nlovely nook at the foot of Thaba Bosigo. Riding here from Maseru I was\r\nable to gain some insight into the richness and fertility of the\r\ncountry. For miles and miles, across a splendid valley, nothing could be\r\nseen but waving corn; its luxuriant growth, however, did not surprise me\r\nwhen on crossing the deep water gullies I could see no end to the depth\r\nof a continuous alluvial deposit. M. Jousse’s station was a sad sight to\r\ncontemplate. Here was a church seated for 800, a boarding school with\r\naccommodation for fifty native girls, a day school, a mission house with\r\nevery token of French elegance and polish, gardens with rare fruit trees\r\nand a yard around, kept scrupulously clean, while melancholy indeed was\r\nit to find all this virtually useless; the war had put a stop to the\r\ncivilizing influence of the good missionary! The school was empty, the\r\nchurch deserted, he alone remaining at his post waiting until “wars and\r\nrumors of wars” had passed away.\r\n\r\nM. Jousse accompanied me to Masupha’s and kindly interpreted for me. We\r\nfound preparations had been made for our visit.\r\n\r\nUnder the shade of a spreading tree near his house skins had been laid\r\nand chairs arranged, Masupha showing unusual civility by receiving us at\r\nonce. I had heard many reports of Masupha’s drinking habits, but he was\r\nquite sober. Of middle height, well dressed in European costume, a\r\nlittle beyond middle age, with a slight nervous twitching of the face, I\r\nnow saw before me the man, black though he was, who had defied and was\r\nstill defying the Cape government! Deep, clever and crafty, this was the\r\nman who had out-manœuvred ministers and statesmen! Lepocquo, with\r\nseveral other of Masupha’s sons and councillors, were present. Masupha\r\nfreely went over the course late events had taken and closed our\r\ninterview by saying: “As far as the loyals are concerned I will never\r\nhave them back, before the war they were always quarreling, now it will\r\nbe worse; as to the magistrates, they ran away of their own accord when\r\nthe war began, it is now a question whether they should be allowed to\r\nreturn,” and, continuing, he said, “you talk about hut tax, refer this\r\nto a pitso of the nation, and as to guns, Sprigg has got five, he is\r\nkicked out,[88] so must the gun-tax be, too.”\r\n\r\nI came away feeling that it would require millions of money and\r\nthousands of men to alter this wily chief’s determination to remain\r\nentirely independent. The Cape government had also become aware of the\r\nexigency of the case, and this led them to inquire whether her Majesty’s\r\ngovernment would permit them to obtain the services of Maj. Gen. Charles\r\nGeorge Gordon, C.B., R.E., “for the purpose of consultation as to the\r\nbest measures to be adopted with reference to Basutoland,” and “to\r\nassist in terminating the war and administering Basutoland.” Chinese\r\nGordon accepted the invitation of the Cape government, but found on his\r\narrival in the colony that the only post offered him was that of\r\ncommandant general of the colonial forces, a post he had refused two\r\nyears before. Although General Gordon came to the Cape with the sole\r\nobject of quelling the rebellion in Basutoland, yet he accepted this\r\nappointment, looking upon it merely as a temporary one until another\r\nposition could be found for Mr. Orpen, who was then British resident in\r\nBasutoland. Gordon, on May 21st, addressed a minute to ministers on the\r\nBasutoland question. In this it could be seen he had intuitively grasped\r\nthe position, and did not believe in setting up brother against brother,\r\nor in other words hounding on the Basutos to destroy one another. His\r\nvarious memoranda on this and other subjects were passed over in silence\r\nby the Cape government, although, believing in the opinion he had\r\nformed, he had offered to go and live as resident with Masupha for two\r\nyears in order to settle matters.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mr. Sauer, secretary for native affairs, met General\r\nGordon at King William’s Town and begged him to go with him to\r\nBasutoland. Gordon reluctantly consented, as he had formed an opinion\r\ndiametrically opposed to Orpen’s policy, and thought his presence would\r\nbe of no service; moreover, after his interview with Letsea (a chief\r\n_supposed_ to be acting in concert with the government), he had become\r\nmore convinced than ever that the government were taking steps in the\r\nwrong direction.\r\n\r\nMr. Sauer then persuaded him to visit Masupha, as a “private\r\nindividual,” to see what could be done, but, can it be believed, at the\r\nvery time General Gordon was undertaking this journey a force under\r\nanother loyal chief, Lerothodi, Letsea’s son, was actually sent to\r\nattack Masupha.\r\n\r\nBy sheer force of character and moral power, which were his great\r\nlevers, he disarmed Masupha’s suspicions of treachery as far as he,\r\nGordon, was concerned, and was allowed by that chieftain to leave “the\r\nfalse position” into which the Cape government, or rather the acts of\r\none of its ministers, had forced him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ROMA MISSION STATION (ROMAN CATHOLIC), BASUTOLAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGordon telegraphed his resignation to the Cape government as soon as he\r\narrived at Aliwal North, which was accepted, and he soon after left the\r\ncolony. The unnecessarily insulting and narrow-minded conclusion to the\r\ntelegram sent to the general by the Cape premier, Mr. (now Sir Thomas)\r\nScanlan, is now, since that hero’s lamented death, a subject of such\r\nworld-wide ridicule that I may be excused quoting it once more: “I\r\nregret to record my conviction that your continuance in the position you\r\noccupy would not be conducive to public interest.” It will ever be a\r\nsource of gratification to me that I had the opportunity of meeting this\r\nnoble man.\r\n\r\nTo return to my narrative. M. Jousse accompanied me several miles on my\r\nroad to Roma, the principal Roman Catholic mission station in\r\nBasutoland, which is built on land given to the Roman Catholic community\r\nby Moshesh in October, 1862. Our road ran around the foot of Thaba\r\nBosigo by the pass where Wepener was shot in the Boer war with the\r\nBasutos, and past Job’s village, which fringed, so to speak, the\r\nmountain with cultivated trees and with houses built in European style.\r\nPassing St. Michael’s, another R. C. mission station, I descended into\r\nthe valley and wound my way round to Roma. This station is most\r\npicturesquely situated. At its back a range of hills protects it from\r\nthe south wind, while just in front a pretty mountain stream runs along,\r\nlazily turning a mill wheel as it courses by. The fathers (oblates of\r\nMary) received me most hospitably. They showed me over the station,\r\nconsisting of a fine mission house, two long double-storied buildings,\r\none used as a dormitory for boys, of whom there are at least fifty\r\nresident, the other for girls, whose number, though about the same,\r\nvaries.\r\n\r\nThese buildings, together with the necessary workshops and tools for\r\nteaching the boys various trades, a separate cottage for visitors, and a\r\nlarge church capable of holding 1,000 people, shaded by a perfect forest\r\nof gum trees, afford an example of what energy and perseverance can\r\naccomplish. I must not forget to mention as well that the garden in\r\nfront of the mission house, arranged in beautiful terraces planted with\r\norange trees, vines, fruit trees and flowers, conveys of itself at once\r\nthe presence of refinement and civilization. I was fortunate enough to\r\nbe in time for evening prayers, and heard the magnificent intoning of\r\nthe Basuto boys, their voices severally blended being perfectly\r\nwonderful.\r\n\r\nIn Basutoland there are at the present time in connection with the\r\nFrench R. C. mission seven stations, five priests, three brothers and\r\neighteen nuns, belonging to the community of sisters of the Saint\r\nFamille of Bordeaux, the first members of which sisterhood arrived at\r\nRoma in April, 1886, following Monseigneur Allard, the Rev. Mr. Gerard\r\nand Brother Bernard, who came up to Moshesh, the paramount chief of the\r\nBasutos, in October, 1862.\r\n\r\nAt Roma, the head station, named by Moshesh Motsi wa M’a Jesu, “the\r\nvillage of the Mother of Jesus,” there is every Sunday an average\r\nattendance at the church services of 800; and I am authentically told\r\nthat the number of natives who every Sunday attend the different\r\nchurches belonging to the mission throughout the country is at least\r\n1,500. This is, however, nothing when compared with the attendance at\r\nthe various grand feasts of the church, where at Roma alone it is no\r\nunusual circumstance for 6,000 or 8,000 to congregate. New Year’s day\r\nmay be called their national fête. This year Letsea, the paramount chief\r\nof Basutoland, attended the ceremonies at Roma on that day, accompanied\r\nby an immense retinue of mounted followers; the throng was so great that\r\na rustic altar was erected amongst the trees, “and a grand and singular\r\nspectacle it was,” the Rev. Father Deltour tells us, “to behold these\r\nthousands of sable figures, massed together under these trees anxious to\r\nwitness the great act of Christian worship.” He further goes on to\r\ndescribe the incidents of the day: “Never in my life did I witness such\r\nperfect order and instant obedience in such a multitude. It was simply\r\nwonderful.” The paramount chief addressed the meeting in the following\r\nwords, which I quote from a letter of the reverend father:\r\n\r\n  “‘I came to Roma, as the Rev. Father had invited me, and right glad am\r\n  I that I did come and witness the work that is carried on in this\r\n  mission. Here the Rev. Fathers and the Sisters sow the seed of peace\r\n  and of religion. This is a village of peace and prayer. In their\r\n  prayers they invoke the help of the Holy Virgin, as the Rev. Father\r\n  has explained this morning; and in my opinion they are right. It is\r\n  prayer that sustains our life. Basutos, be united to your chief, be\r\n  one nation under one chief, or you will divide yourselves and be lost.\r\n  Look at the stream which descends from the mountain; it gathers\r\n  strength because its waters are not divided, but run compact toward\r\n  that mighty something which I know not, and which is called the sea.\r\n  Do likewise and you shall be strong. Let the Fathers and the Sisters\r\n  pray for our Basutoland; let them pray for rain, which is so much\r\n  wanted. Pula!’\r\n\r\n  “In response to the royal speech a tremendous ‘Pula’ burst forth from\r\n  all, and was echoed far and wide by the surrounding mountains.\r\n\r\n  “After Letsea had spoken and the meeting was over, the cliffs and\r\n  rocks of the mountain side almost in an instant were covered with\r\n  spectators anxious to see the races, in which a hundred horses ran, in\r\n  the presence of an excited multitude. As evening drew nigh and the\r\n  sports were drawing to a conclusion, the mass of people retired, no\r\n  visitors remaining in the village.”\r\n\r\nThe Basutos are, as a rule, in their heathen state, unreliable, lustful,\r\nintemperate and overbearing, and the work of the missionary as he\r\nstrives to render them faithful, self-controlled and modest is an\r\nappalling task, but one undertaken in full faith of divine guidance.\r\n\r\nThe French Protestant mission, which has its headquarters in Paris,\r\nfirst began its operations in Basutoland at Morija in 1833. It possesses\r\nat the present time fourteen head stations and eighty-two out-stations,\r\nwith a staff of twenty-one European missionaries and 122 native\r\ncatechists and schoolmasters. In 1884 the number of church members was\r\n4,988, and of day scholars in the schools 2,947.\r\n\r\nAt Morija, the head mission station, there is a training institution for\r\nyoung men who study for the Cape elementary teacher’s certificate, a\r\nBible school for the education of catechists, together with a\r\nprinting-press for the issue of a bimonthly periodical in Sesuto called\r\n“Leselinyana” (or Little Light). So it can be seen that Protestants are\r\nvying with Roman Catholics in spreading religious training and\r\ninstruction among this people.\r\n\r\nDuring the late war, however, there was a distinct difference to be\r\nnoted between the influence exerted by the R. C. missionaries and the\r\nProtestant. The Protestant, as a rule, interfered and even still meddle\r\nwith politics; they showed themselves partisans of the late Sprigg\r\nministry, and the consequence was that their influence declined, their\r\ncongregations fell away, and their schools became deserted. The R. C.\r\npriests on the contrary, ignoring politics entirely, feeling their duty\r\nto be more spiritual than temporal, were rewarded by having their\r\nschools and churches as well attended during as before the war. As an\r\ninstance of the estimation in which they were held, two personal friends\r\nof mine, Fathers Libihan and Cretinon, in December, 1880, were ordered\r\nby their bishop to proceed to this very place, Roma, in the heart of\r\nBasutoland. The war was just then at its height, when having to pass\r\nThaba Bosigo, where Masupha, the head centre of the rebellion, was\r\nliving, they were hospitably received and entertained until the\r\nfollowing morning. Though I am a Protestant myself, I cannot but\r\nrecognize that this speaks volumes in favor of the non-political\r\ninterference of my R. C. friends, and the esteem in which they were held\r\nby the Basutos. Let any Protestant missionary have attempted this at the\r\ntime, his life would have paid the penalty of his temerity, and a just\r\npunishment, too, I should have considered it; the mixing of religion and\r\npolitics among natives like Basutos, being, in my opinion, an\r\nunpardonable mistake. This difference between the conduct of these\r\nrespective ministers with regard to public matters was recognized even\r\nby the Boers in their war of 1865–68.\r\n\r\nBidding the hospitable monks adieu, I left Roma next morning in a\r\npouring rain, with the guides provided me by the chief Jonathan, having\r\nmade all the arrangements to catch the Capetown steamer at East London.\r\n\r\nStopping at Khorokhoro to breakfast, I continued my journey through a\r\ncountry mountainous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Morija mission station (French Protestant) on my left, I was\r\ncaught in a fearful thunder-storm, the rain coming down in torrents, but\r\nI luckily found shelter in a hut in a small native village which lay in\r\nmy road.\r\n\r\nEntering, I found myself in the midst of a Basuto family, consisting of\r\nfather, mother and seven little girls from four to twelve years of age.\r\nHere I had the opportunity afforded me of noting the truth of that which\r\nhad often been told me concerning the rapid progress in learning, the\r\nprecocity in fact, distinguishing Basuto children. If either Mr. Moody\r\nor Mr. Sankey had been with me, their hearts would have leaped with joy;\r\nhere in the heart of Basutoland I found the noise of the outside storm\r\ndrowned in the music of some of their popular hymns. The chief\r\nfavorites, sung over and over again, were “Ntoa sa Balumeh” (Hold the\r\nFort) and “Mali a Konyana” (The Blood of the Lamb). No sight ever\r\nimpressed me more with the important position music and hymns hold as\r\nfactors in the progress of evangelization.\r\n\r\nLuther’s enemies once said that he worked more harm by his songs than\r\nhis sermons, and I felt that the same might in the nineteenth century be\r\nrepeated by enemies of the Christian faith concerning these two\r\ncelebrated American revivalists. even in the wilds of Africa.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to picture or portray a more peculiar scene!\r\nOutside, the howling of the raging storm, the peals of rolling thunder,\r\nthe flashes of vivid lightning and the plash of the torrents of rain;\r\ninside, the Basuto youngsters stark naked, myself and guides crouching\r\nover the fire drenched to the skin, while strains familiar in years gone\r\nby were sung with all the vigor and fervor of aboriginal youth! As soon\r\nas the storm had passed over I rode quickly to make up for lost time,\r\nand crossing the dangerous drift of the Salt River, rested at the Boleka\r\nridge thirteen miles from Mafeting. This was as far as our forces ever\r\nadvanced during the war. The road goes over a ridge which is not very\r\nsteep, and is a gap in the mountain chain. At the village close to the\r\nroadside I saw many relics of the late war. Fragments of shells were\r\nlying about (this being the pass which our troops tried in vain to\r\nforce), and I saw one unexploded sixty-eight-pound shell doing the\r\npeaceful duty of serving as a seat for a Kafir who in happy ignorance\r\nwas sitting on it drying himself at a wood fire!\r\n\r\nAfter a short rest for my horses and guides, I went over the ridge and\r\npassed by the deserted intrenchments where our troops had encamped in\r\nvirtual idleness for months. A tedious ride brought me to Mafeting,\r\nwhich I did not reach until far into the night; when I was very\r\nfortunate in dropping upon an old friend, the late Captain Aschman, who\r\ngave me a “shake-down,” for which, as there was no inn in the village, I\r\nwas sincerely thankful.\r\n\r\nNext morning I visited the broken-down wattle huts and ragged tents\r\nwhere the loyals were herded together. I found them far worse off than\r\ntheir _confrères_ at Maseru, and grave were their complaints against the\r\ngovernment. The rations allowed them were not sufficient, they told me,\r\nto allay their hunger, and I personally saw some emaciated looking women\r\ncollecting and eating the corn falling from the horses’ mangers. These\r\nunfortunate creatures, stung by our ingratitude, irritated by our\r\ninjustice, hoping against hope, almost, despairing of relief and yet\r\nremaining loyal, were enough to excite the sympathy of any true man, and\r\ncreate a loathing of the cowardly panderers to expediency who were then\r\nconducting the government of the country.\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly investigated the condition of these people, I next\r\nvisited the cemetery, a short distance from the village, which is full\r\nof interest. Here many an old colonist, “sleeps the sleep that knows no\r\nwaking.” Among the many monuments to men fallen in the late war is a\r\nfine stone pedestal erected in memory of the disastrous affair at\r\nKalibani, which will ever be remembered in colonial annals as the place\r\nwhere, on Oct. 19th, 1880, thirty-five of the First Cape mounted\r\nyeomanry, men principally from Grahamstown and Albany, and who formed\r\nthe advance guard of General Clark’s relief column, were cut to pieces.\r\nEvery one of these unfortunate men, except one who was shot at a long\r\nrange, were, as Surgeon Major Smith, now practicing in the Diamond\r\nFields, who examined the bodies, told me, assegaied and hewed to pieces\r\nwith the greatest brutality by the rebellious Basutos under the chief\r\nMama.\r\n\r\nA magnificent view of the surrounding mountainous country is obtained\r\nfrom this graveyard. The Kalibani mountain, the Kolo, the Boleka ridge,\r\nTweefontein, Lerothodi’s village away in the distance, and close below\r\nMafeting itself, pass as in a panorama before the view.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom-like prosperity of Mafeting, brought about by the share it\r\nreceived of the lavish expenditure of £6,000,000 of colonial money\r\nduring the war, had, however, at the time of my visit, completely waned,\r\nand many had been sorely disappointed by the sudden cessation of\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nLeaving this place in the afternoon I reached Wepener the same night,\r\nand after receiving the kind hospitality of Mr. Fraser, _the_ merchant\r\nof the place, started again at daybreak, and arrived at Aliwal North\r\nafter a long day’s drive. A good view of the town, which is of\r\nconsiderable importance, possessing a valuable library, a nice little\r\nclub, large church and well-filled stores, is obtained before crossing\r\nthe fine iron bridge leading over the Orange River.\r\n\r\nStaying the night, noon next day found me sitting behind four horses on\r\nthe road to Queenstown, where, after passing through Dordrecht, I\r\narrived at six o’clock, just in time to catch the night train for East\r\nLondon, where I arrived next morning (March 13th). After a rest I went\r\nround the town, saw the sights, being particularly interested in the\r\nreclaiming of land which was going on under government direction at the\r\nmouth of the Buffalo River, and which, at some not far distant date,\r\nwill be of great value. The next day I was invited to a large picnic\r\ngiven by one of the boating companies, at a delightful spot in a wooded\r\nglen about four miles from East London, on the banks of the Buffalo\r\nRiver. Glorious weather, good company, beautiful scenery, charming\r\nmusic, a fine lunch, sparkling champagne; everything harmonized to make\r\na pleasant day. Colonel Schermbrucker and myself were called upon to\r\nspeak, and we complied in a few words. Returning in the afternoon to\r\nEast London I spent the night reveling in the mazy waltz at a ball given\r\nin the Mutual Hall, and sailed next morning in the _Melrose_ for Port\r\nElizabeth, where I transhipped to the _Grantully Castle_ for\r\nCapetown.[89]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Cape parliament following in a day or two, I found\r\namong the passengers ten fellow members of the house of assembly hailing\r\nfrom different parts of the colony, and proceeding to the performance of\r\ntheir legislative duties.\r\n\r\nAmong others on board I met Sir D. Wedderburn, since deceased, whose\r\nacquaintance I had formed in Kimberley, where I had the pleasure of\r\nentertaining him some few weeks before on his way round through Natal\r\nand the Free State.\r\n\r\nMany a pleasant hour I spent talking over with him the various political\r\ntopics of the day. His opinion of South African men and things had not\r\nbeen changed at all since I last saw him, and he told me “he had seen\r\nnothing in Africa which caused him in the least to alter the opinions he\r\nhad formed before he came out.” I recollect his opinions on the then two\r\nall absorbing topics of the day, the Transvaal and the Zulu questions.\r\nThese were very clear; he often said “we ought never to have fought for\r\nwhat we ought never to have taken,” adding in reference to the Zulu\r\nquestion, on which he had formed a decided opinion, “there was little\r\npleasure in punishing men who bravely defended their native country.”\r\nSir Bartle Frere’s “forward” policy found no supporter in him.\r\n\r\nThere was something irresistibly charming in meeting and discussing\r\npassing events with such a man. He impressed all who met him with the\r\nsincerity of his convictions and the honesty of his purpose.\r\n\r\nOur journey, however, quickly drew to an end. The work of the session,\r\nwe found on our arrival, had already commenced.\r\n\r\nThe main business transacted during this session was the passing through\r\nthe house of assembly of an act, throwing further restrictions on the\r\ntrade in diamonds, which I have already fully dealt with, the presenting\r\nof the petition of Jonathan Molappo, praying that a deputation of three\r\nBasutos might “plead their cause” at the bar of the house, which proved\r\na profitless appeal, debates on Basutoland following _ad nauseam_, the\r\ngrant of two extra members to represent Kimberley, and the introduction\r\nof the “Constitution Ordinance Amendment Bill,” allowing the Dutch\r\nlanguage to be spoken in the house. This last measure met with no\r\nopposition, but became law on Jan. 14th, 1882. After this bill had gone\r\nthrough its various stages, Mr. Luttig, one of the Dutch members, rose\r\nand made the first speech in that language, expressing his gratification\r\nthat no opposition was offered by his English speaking friends; but,\r\nthough a Dutchman, he concluded by saying “that although it is my first\r\nspeech in Dutch, it will most likely be my last, as I wish to promote\r\nharmony and good feeling, and when I speak, I wish my English friends\r\nwho do not understand Dutch to know what I wish to convey.” This\r\nprivilege has not since its concession been much used.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual session in 1882, a short special session was held in\r\nJanuary 1883, which was called to deal exclusively with the affairs of\r\nBasutoland, and arrange about the compensation of the “loyals” and other\r\nmatters of importance. On my return to Kimberley in February after this\r\nspecial session, according to my previously expressed intention, I\r\nresigned my seat in the Cape house of assembly.\r\n\r\nI then resumed full charge of my medical practice, until I met with a\r\nsevere accident in December of the same year, when proceeding to inquire\r\ninto some cases of suspected small-pox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n   DESCRIPTION OF THE RELIGIOUS BODIES OF THE DIAMOND FIELDS FROM THE\r\n    EARLIEST DAYS.—EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS.—THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND.—ROMAN\r\n      CATHOLICS FROM THE DEATH OF FATHER HIDIEN TO THAT OF FATHER\r\nWALSHE.—DUTCH REFORMED CHURCH.—DOPPERS.—WESLEYANS.—PRESBYTERIANS.—GERMAN\r\nLUTHERANS.—JEWS.—MAHOMETANS.—HINDUS.—“BISHOP MELLET.”—NATIVES.—NEGLECTED\r\n   OPPORTUNITIES.—ADVENT OF SALVATION ARMY.—SUNDRY VISITORS.—BIRDS OF\r\n                                PASSAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average diamond digger, in the first wild rush, “the feverish race\r\nfor wealth,” was not of a markedly irreligious disposition, as might\r\nhave been expected, judging from the analogy of mining camps in other\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe distance of the Vaal River from any colonial town, and the expense\r\nof reaching the diggings on its banks made it a matter of impossibility\r\nfor men without means, either to reach the place or to support\r\nthemselves after their arrival; hence, the first comers were, as a\r\nmatter of course, above the general stamp of those who constitute a\r\ndigging community. They were men, as a rule, well educated and well\r\nbrought up, and it was not likely that they would altogether forget\r\ntheir early religious training or to allow these duties to lapse into\r\nutter neglect; but at the same time the results of the complete absence\r\nof women and children, and the sobering effect which their influence\r\nproduces, was in the early days more or less observable.\r\n\r\nThe first clergymen of the Church of England who visited the new El\r\nDorado, were Archdeacons Kitton and Croghan, of the diocese of\r\nBloemfontein, who visited Klipdrift, on the Vaal River, in 1870, where\r\namidst the most strange and unusual surroundings they held religious\r\nservices for the diggers.\r\n\r\nI have still a vivid recollection of the primitive state of things\r\nexisting, even when I arrived some months afterward. On the first Sunday\r\nthat I spent on the Diamond Fields in November 1871, I attended a\r\n“Church of England” service at the New Rush or Colesberg Kopje, as\r\nKimberley was then called. This was held in a canvas tent billiard-room,\r\nsituated near the spot where the “Blue Posts” still remains. On entering\r\nI beheld a full-robed clergyman officiating at one end of a billiard\r\ntable, which served for his reading desk, whilst a large and attentive\r\ncrowd sat around the other end, some on rude benches which were fixed\r\nalong the walls, others perched upon gin cases, buckets reversed, or any\r\nother make-shift that came to hand. The congregation behaved with\r\nsuitable decorum, but I confess it was not easy to keep the mind from\r\nwandering to the incongruity of the surroundings. Whilst the parson was\r\nearnestly engaged imploring our deliverance “from all the deceits of the\r\nworld, the flesh and the devil,” I caught many an eye looking askance at\r\nthe cues in the corner, no doubt indulging in reflections on the past,\r\nand in speculations as to the success or non-success of some match to be\r\nplayed in the future. Moreover, when the parson was praying or the\r\npeople singing, it was not particularly edifying to be interrupted by\r\nthe lively chaff and occasional bursts of blasphemy, which we could\r\nplainly hear through the canvas party-walls, which separated us from the\r\nadjoining bar and its half tipsy occupants. Defoe’s lines:\r\n\r\n                “Wherever God erects a house of prayer,\r\n                The Devil always builds a chapel there.”\r\n\r\nhad here a liberal interpretation indeed—although I am not sure that\r\nthey were strictly applicable in this instance, seeing that our parson\r\nhad knowingly thrust himself into the devil’s own domain.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these drawbacks, and despite the fiascos which resulted\r\nfrom our unfortunate attempts to properly render the appointed hymns, it\r\nwas nevertheless refreshing to hear the grand old service once again and\r\nhave the recollection of one’s early days brought back, even amidst such\r\ninharmonious concomitants.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Canon Doxat was the first clergyman of the Church of England\r\nwho took general charge of the diggings, and until his health gave way\r\nand he returned home invalided in 1877, both here, and in later years at\r\nBarkly, he was indefatigable in his work, whether as parish priest,\r\nattendant on the sick, or instructor of the young. The Rev. W. Rickards\r\nsucceeded him at the dry diggings in 1871. During his rectorship a\r\nraw-brick structure, now a store, was erected in place of the canvas\r\nbuilding which hitherto had done ecclesiastical duty, the congregation\r\nmeanwhile growing rapidly in numbers and influence. During the whole of\r\nthis period Mr. Rickards was also assiduous in pushing forward the cause\r\nof education, which had been much neglected. After this working\r\nminister’s leaving for England, three clergymen, the Revs. Messrs.\r\nMaude, Borton and Hanbury successively held the rectorship. During the\r\nincumbency of the first gentleman a new and larger church, of corrugated\r\niron, was built in a more central part of the town, which, just on\r\nnearing its completion in 1879, was blown to the ground, a complete\r\nruin, but it was quickly rebuilt, and opened for worship in 1880.[90]\r\nThe church and schools during the incumbencies of these gentlemen\r\ngradually increased in numbers under the organization of the Right Rev.\r\nAllan B. Webb, D. D., bishop of Bloemfontein, under whose spiritual\r\njurisdiction the English Church in Griqualand West was then placed.\r\nBishop Webb, however, later on in 1882, resigned his see, and after an\r\ninterval of three years the Rev. G. W. H. Knight-Bruce was appointed,\r\nlast year (1886), to fill the vacant bishopric.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Rev. Canon Gaul, who is rector of St. Cyprian’s\r\nand rural dean of Griqualand West and Bechuanaland, with four assistant\r\npriests, conducts the services of the church in Kimberley and\r\nBeaconsfield, while two native mission churches, one in Kimberley and\r\none at Phokoane, in Bechuanaland, are ministered to by faithful and\r\ndevoted clergy. I may add that several new churches and buildings are\r\nprojected, but although the amount of money raised for church purposes\r\nduring the year ending Easter, 1885, was £6,815, yet the church’s\r\npresent financial condition still requires a zealous effort to be made\r\nby its supporters to clear it from the burden of debt.\r\n\r\nThe services, both at St. Cyprian’s, Kimberley, and at All Saints,\r\nBeaconsfield, may by some be considered of a High Church, if not\r\nritualistic character, but although a tendency in that direction may\r\nexist, I am glad to state that these services are not conducted by High\r\nChurch clergymen of an emasculate or hysterical type, men indulging in\r\nman millinery or ritualistic playthings, but by earnest, honest workers,\r\nin genuine sympathy with their fellow creatures.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Roman Catholics, I am only doing justice to the memory of\r\nFather Hidien, the first Roman Catholic priest who visited the Fields,\r\nin stating that he was the leading figure in the religious world of the\r\nearly days. Not only was he beloved by the members of his own faith, but\r\na kindly disposition, never weary in well doing, and a boundless,\r\npractical charity, caused him to be revered by the members of every\r\ndenomination. Dr. Allard, then bishop of, and who at the time visited\r\nthe diggings, placed the Catholics on the Diamond Fields under his care,\r\nbut this charge he did not long retain, for the summer of 1871, among\r\nits many victims, snatched away the good father from his work. Father Le\r\nBihan, who had worked for several years among the natives of Basutoland,\r\nthen came to take Father Hidien’s place. At that time the Catholics of\r\nDu Toit’s Pan, like the Hebrews of old in the desert, assembled for\r\ndivine worship in a tent, while their priest, living in a tent wagon\r\nclose by, was ready to follow his congregation wherever a new Rush might\r\ndraw them.\r\n\r\nWhen Colesberg Kopje (Kimberley mine) developed into a permanent\r\ndigging, Father Le Bihan followed, and it was here through his\r\ninstrumentality that a permanent church of wood and iron was erected.\r\nWhen this was out of debt, Father Le Bihan turned his attention to\r\neducation, and built in an incredibly short space of time the three\r\nfirst schools in Griqualand West, one for boys, one for girls, and the\r\nthird for infants. Just at this juncture Bishop Rickards paid the Fields\r\na visit from Grahamstown, and at a banquet which was given in his honor\r\non that occasion, I recollect that Mr. R. W. Murray, Sen., the\r\nvice-chairman, telling the company “that his experience of the Catholic\r\nchurch in South Africa was, that wherever the Catholics erected\r\nchurches, schools at once followed, of which Kimberley was an instance\r\nin point.” The truth of the vice-chairman’s observations was felt by\r\nall. Later on the same evening the bishop responding to the special\r\ntoast of “Education,” which had been entrusted to me, gave the first\r\npublic intimation of his intention to introduce Trappist monks from a\r\nmonastery in Algeria into South Africa, saying: “These would teach the\r\nsanctity of labor, and prepare the natives to receive the great truths\r\nof Christianity.” This scheme the bishop afterward endeavored to carry\r\nout, but the work at Dunbrodie, near Port Elizabeth, led to\r\ndisappointment, the climate, drought and heat not favoring the efforts\r\nof the monks. Subsequently they removed to Mariann Hill, near Pinetown,\r\nin Natal, where every success is following their work.\r\n\r\nBishop Jolivet, however, soon discovered that Father Le Bihan’s labors\r\ncould not longer be spared from the scene of his former triumphs, and\r\nFather Walshe took his place here in 1876, and entering at once heart\r\nand soul into the work of his predecessor, remained until the beginning\r\nof 1878. Then leaving he became a soldier of the cross in more senses\r\nthan one, his tall form familiar alike to sick persons and young\r\nchildren and to prisoners and captives, his genial, happy disposition\r\nand his wonderful influence being transferred to scenes where his\r\ncourageous devotion and his readiness at the call of duty could perhaps\r\nbe even more appreciated than with us—as military chaplain during the\r\nZulu war, the Sekukuni campaign and the Transvaal outbreak. He also was\r\nchaplain in the perhaps unnecessary, and to a certain section annoying,\r\nbecause bloodless, Bechuanaland expedition. He seemed to possess a\r\ncharmed life. It mattered not to him whether he was cheering the wounded\r\nat Ulundi, regardless of the bullets raining around, or whether he was\r\ntending the sick in the beleagured fort of Lydenburg, duty was ever\r\nparamount, and he was indeed one of those\r\n\r\n                   “Quos non profani tessera proclii\r\n                     Duxit in bellum.”\r\n\r\nIt was my melancholy lot to see him (in consultation) during his last\r\nillness, bravely struggling for life against a severe attack of lung\r\ninflammation, which carried him off on Sept. 12th, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Father Lenoir, the present parish priest, who succeeded Father\r\nWalshe in 1878, at once set to work with indomitable energy. Noticing\r\nthe lack of opportunity which existed for the education of Roman\r\nCatholic girls, he built a convent, and with the hearty concurrence of\r\nBishop Jolivet procured from Europe some Sisters of the Holy Family to\r\nassist in the meritorious work.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greek proverb declares that “the beginning is the half of\r\nthe whole,” or as the homely Saxon saw puts it, “Well begun and half\r\ndone;” and now the Rev. Mother, Lady Superior, in a double sense of the\r\nword, and the Sisters of the Holy Family, perform their daily duties in\r\nbuildings, which for Kimberley, a place but a few short years ago an\r\nuninhabited grassy plain, are simply magnificent.\r\n\r\nNot content with this Father Lenoir commenced the construction in stone\r\nand brick of a building designed for a new church, the old one built by\r\nFather Le Bihan having become too small for the congregation. The\r\nfoundation stone was laid by Bishop Jolivet on Nov. 1st, 1879, and in\r\none year the most handsome sacred building in Kimberley was opened for\r\ndivine worship. Father Lenoir told his congregation at the time that\r\n“nothing was too grand for the service of the Almighty,” and right well\r\nthey had seconded his efforts, for this magnificent structure,\r\npossessing beautiful altar paintings and appurtenances which cost over\r\n£7,000, is entirely free from debt. A lesson from this might easily be\r\nlearned by the members of the Church of England. In 1883 a new church\r\nand school were also erected at Beaconsfield.\r\n\r\nThese are under the care of the Sisters of the Holy Family and the\r\npriests of Kimberley, while a home for destitute children is in course\r\nof erection at Barkly.\r\n\r\nThe Indians as well, who have found their way here from Hindostan,\r\nMauritius and Natal, of whom a considerable number are Roman Catholics,\r\nreceive their share of attention, no less than 200 being taught at the\r\nmission school. I may mention in conclusion that not only in spiritual\r\nbut also in temporal matters the Catholic priesthood has endeavored to\r\nforward the public welfare.\r\n\r\nSt. Mary’s Benefit Society, of which since its formation in 1876 I have\r\nhad medical charge, contributes greatly to the assistance of any of its\r\nmembers who may be stricken down by disease, and also aids in Catholic\r\nmatters generally, while at the same time its thorough organization and\r\nits deeds of charity are assisting to make Roman Catholicism influential\r\nin the country.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Diamond Fields, when Griqualand West, which\r\ncomprises _the_ four diamond mines of the world, was still the property\r\nof the Orange Free State, and the institutions of the place were\r\nadministered by its officials, the Dutch people and language occupied a\r\nposition of importance. The Dutch as a rule are highly conservative in\r\ntheir religious tendencies, and it can well be imagined the Dutch\r\nReformed Church, with its synod and kirkraad, its ministers, elders and\r\ndeacons was not long in following and taking care of its nomadic\r\nadherents. The Dutch Reformed Church, which is Calvinistic in doctrine,\r\nwas founded in the Netherlands in the year 1579. It then accepted as its\r\nchief doctrinal standard the Belgic Confession, translated in 1562 from\r\nthe “Confession de Foy” of Guido de Brès. This confession was revised at\r\nthe synod of Dordrecht in the years 1618 and 1619, and since that time\r\nthe standards of the Dutch Reformed Church have been the following,\r\nviz., 1. The Heidelberg Catechism, containing instructions in the\r\nChristian religion. 2. The Belgic Confession, with more elaborate\r\ndetails, and 3. The Canons of Dordrecht, which are mainly supplementary\r\nto the Belgic Confession.\r\n\r\nThe earliest congregation in South Africa of the members of the Dutch\r\nReformed Church, a branch of the Church in Holland, was formed at the\r\nvery commencement of the Cape Colony, the first minister coming from\r\nHolland in 1665 to attend to its wants.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Reformed remained the Established Church of the Cape of Good\r\nHope, notwithstanding the interim of English rule, which lasted from\r\n1795 to 1802. In this latter year the Treaty of Amiens, having brought\r\nthe Colony back to its former relationship with Holland, the\r\nadministration of Cape affairs was resumed by the Dutch until 1806, when\r\nthe Government of the Dutch was finally closed by the articles of\r\ncapitulation agreed to at the foot of Sir Lowry’s Pass, and afterwards\r\nratified at the Castle in Capetown in January of the same year between\r\nGeneral Baird and General Janssens, the English and Dutch commanders.\r\nPublic worship on that occasion received special mention. In the 8th\r\nArticle of Capitulation it was stipulated that, “Public worship as now\r\nin use will also continue without interference.” And so it did, for the\r\nDutch Reformed remained the Established Church in South Africa, and\r\nreceived state aid as well; no less than 30 congregations (until the\r\npassing of Saul Solomon’s “Voluntary Bill” in 1879 put an end to further\r\nstate patronage) acquiring grants averaging £200 per annum each.\r\n\r\nAt the diggings on the Vaal River, the Dutch were not neglected by the\r\npastors of their Church, ministers from the Cape Colony and the Orange\r\nFree State paying periodical visits to the camps. It was not, however,\r\nuntil there was a pretty certain prospect of the dry diggings becoming\r\nmore than a passing dream that churches were built, congregations\r\nestablished, and ministers appointed, at Du Toit’s Pan and Kimberley in\r\n1872. These congregations, which were large, numbering at Kimberley some\r\n3500 souls, and at Du Toit’s Pan more than 1500, were in the first place\r\nindependent, but became subject to the Synod of the “Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch in South Africa,” (the official name for the Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch of the Cape Colony,) when Griqualand West was annexed to the Cape\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nOwing to the decadence of mining by individual diggers, and the\r\nconsequent falling away of the population, these churches have suffered\r\nmuch in the number of their adherents, the congregation of Kimberley now\r\nnumbering about 1200 only and Du Toit’s Pan about 600 souls.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Reformed Church has no missions standing in connection with\r\nthe parish of Kimberley, as the field is already taken up by the Berlin\r\nMissionary Society, and the Wesleyans and Independent bodies, but they\r\nhave a native church at Beaconsfield founded in 1878, and a church for\r\ncolored people, with fine buildings and parsonage, built in 1883.\r\n\r\nAt Kimberley the Rev. J. D. Kestell, the present pastor, has for some\r\nyears been most zealous in superintending the erection of the new church\r\njust completed, situated in the Newton Market Square.\r\n\r\nThis church is unrivalled on the Diamond Fields. Built solidly of brick\r\nin Roman style, it has a most commanding appearance, and its interior,\r\nwith beautifully fitted pews and panelled ceiling, is a fine specimen of\r\nchaste simplicity of architecture. To crown all, it has little or no\r\ndebt, although nearly £6000 has been spent on its construction. At\r\nBeaconsfield the Dutch Reformed Church has a fine building for divine\r\nworship, while both there and at Kimberley, as well as at the Mission\r\nSchool for colored people, the cause of education is not forgotten.\r\nBefore concluding my description of the Dutch Reformed Church, I must\r\nnot forget to mention a sight, which occasionally was beheld some ten\r\nyears ago, flitting across the view like the spectre of a bygone age.\r\nThis was a visitor who appeared as singular in his garb as a Quaker of\r\nthe old school would be to twentieth century eyes, for with a peculiarly\r\nshaped black cloth tunic, long hair cut in a circle round his neck and\r\nforehead like a Russian Cossack, a rough beard, lips cleanly shaved, and\r\na hat oval and low crowned with a tremendous broad green-lined brim, to\r\nshade his ruddy cheeks, he used to be the “observed of all observers.”\r\nThis picture is that of a “dopper” farmer who used occasionally to be\r\nseen selling his corn on our market, but who, I fear, from his continued\r\nabsence, has long since been gathered to the garner filled with “the\r\nbearded grain and the flowers that grow between.”\r\n\r\nThese “doppers,” relics of the past, of whom, I believe, President\r\nKruger is a representative in the Transvaal, do not differ essentially\r\nfrom the members of the Dutch Reformed Church in doctrine; they are\r\nsimply more conservative in feeling, less liberal in action, very\r\njealous of innovation and entirely unprogressive in ideas.\r\n\r\nThis I think will give my readers a fair idea of the Dutch Reformed\r\nChurch as it exists in South Africa at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A “DOPPER” BOER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong dissenting bodies, the Wesleyans are numerically the most\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThe first regular minister sent to hold service on the Diamond Fields\r\nwas the Rev. I. Priestly, appointed by the English Conference in 1871.\r\nPrevious to his arrival, however, the Rev. W. Wynne, who after a long\r\ninterval has again resumed charge at Kimberley, conducted services in\r\nthe various camps. During this interval, which extended over some twelve\r\nyears, these services were carried on, among others, by the Rev. I. I.\r\nCalvert, well known through his labors in the Fiji Islands, and other\r\ntalented and able men. As a proof of their energetic ministrations, up\r\nto the present time this body has steadily increased, and now, as the\r\nresult of persistent work, in Kimberley alone, three English, one Dutch\r\nand one native Wesleyan church, under four European and one native\r\nminister, can be counted.\r\n\r\nIn Du Toit’s Pan there is an English as well as a native congregation,\r\nboth under the charge of the Rev. B. Hayes. To show the hold which\r\nWesleyanism has gained here I have carefully calculated the average\r\nSunday attendance at the various Wesleyan chapels on the Fields, and\r\nfind it to be nearly 2000, while I am also informed that 600 children\r\nregularly receive religious instruction.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 certain Presbyterians. Congregationalists, and a few Baptists,\r\nwho had hitherto been worshipping with the Wesleyans, finding their\r\nnumbers increasing, thought the time had arrived to constitute\r\nthemselves into a separate Church. This was in due course accomplished,\r\nand although the Church that they formed had no connection with any\r\nPresbytery, being entirely self-governing, the title of Presbyterian was\r\nassumed. They possess a fine place of worship, and an average\r\ncongregation of four hundred souls. The present minister is Mr. Lloyd,\r\nwho displays great energy in the discharge of his duties, and has the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that his efforts are appreciated by large\r\ncongregations.\r\n\r\nThe population of Kimberley, it is scarcely necessary for me to say, is\r\nmade up of different nationalities, among which the German is one of the\r\nmost segregative.\r\n\r\nIn one of the quiet thoroughfares leading to the mine, a neat little\r\nchurch may be seen, which on inquiry proves to be that belonging to the\r\nGerman Lutherans.\r\n\r\nThe Germans for the last ten years have been fortunate enough to be able\r\nto worship God in their own language, and from the inauguration of the\r\nLutheran services they have been conducted by their present pastor, the\r\nRev. C. Meyer, of the Berlin Missionary Society. The first services were\r\nheld in the High Court, lent for the purpose, in January, 1875, and were\r\ncontinued there until the completion of the present church in October of\r\nthe same year. The congregation naturally being confined within the\r\nlimits of those speaking the German tongue, it is not large, numbering\r\nabout 150. The German children in Kimberley as a rule go to English\r\nschools, but twice a week their pastor holds a class to which he gives\r\ninstruction, through the medium of the German language.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are virtually “Strangers in a strange land,” but\r\nnotwithstanding this, they have devoted a good deal of attention to the\r\nnatives, and the resident church minister has at the present time a\r\nlarge native mission under his charge.\r\n\r\nAnother congregation, and one which comprises men born in the most\r\ndistant and diverse parts of the world, is that of the Jewish people,\r\nwho have for ages been known as judges and dealers in precious stones,\r\nand who, therefore, as may readily be conceived, muster in large numbers\r\nat the Diamond Mines of Brazil, and in still greater numbers at those of\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the wonderful finds on the Vaal River became known in Europe,\r\nmany representatives of eminent English and continental Jewish firms,\r\nwith, of course, others drawn from the Colony, appeared on the scene,\r\nand a Jewish circle was soon formed which at the present time numbers\r\nsome 1400 souls, of which about 600 are adult males. On the Vaal River\r\nand in the first days of the Dry Diggings at Du Toit’s Pan and New Rush,\r\nthe Jews had no rabbi or reader to conduct their services, nor had they\r\na synagogue in which to read prayers with due solemnity. Consequently on\r\nholidays and festivals, of which there are six during the year, some\r\nlarge store or public hall was converted into a temporary synagogue\r\nwhere were duly explained the scrolls of the Sacred Law, and where three\r\nmembers of their community officiated by turns.\r\n\r\nAt that time no Sabbath holidays were kept, and if deaths occurred, or\r\nthe anniversary of deaths was observed, prayers were read in some\r\nprivate house. When, too, the initiatory rite of circumcision had to be\r\nperformed, a minister or rabbi, at a great expense, was sent for to\r\nCapetown or Port Elizabeth. The wealthy Jewish community of the Diamond\r\nFields did not long allow this state of affairs to continue, but in 1876\r\nbuilt a synagogue at a cost of £3000 on ground given them by the London\r\nand South African Exploration Company. In course of time a rabbi was\r\nobtained from England, and a Hebrew school, attached to the synagogue,\r\nwas duly instituted. This rabbi, the Rev. M. Mendelssohn, retired at the\r\nconclusion of the period of his engagement, and was succeeded by the\r\nRev. A. Ornstein, a young but most energetic minister, in the month of\r\nAugust, 1881. The ministrations of this gifted and noble man lasted but\r\ntoo brief a time. He came here and found the Sabbath but rarely observed\r\nwith any strictness, and in other respects too may be applied to him the\r\nwords “his righteous soul was vexed with the iniquity of the wicked.”\r\nUndisturbed by the blazing heat of the African sun or the remonstrances\r\nof his friends, he pressed on his chosen path of self-denial and\r\ndevotion, with the result that before a few short months had flown by he\r\nhad fallen a victim to fever. His influence is not yet passed away, as\r\nthe increased number of stores closed on the Hebrew Sabbath serve to\r\ntestify.[91]\r\n\r\nIn connection with their synagogue the Jews have also two philanthropic\r\nSocieties conferring monetary gifts and medical attendance on the\r\ndeserving poor. Their charities, however, are not confined solely to\r\ntheir co-religionists, Jewish citizens having ever been found to the\r\nfront in all works of charity.\r\n\r\nComing next to the Malays residing on the Diamond Fields: they form by\r\nno means an inconsiderable portion of the population, either in number,\r\nrespectability or voting power. As long ago as the year 1871, three or\r\nfour, more than ordinarily adventurous, could be seen digging at the\r\nVaal River, and on the opening up of the Dry Diggings several might have\r\nbeen found at Du Toit’s Pan, but it is in late years only that the\r\n“Malay Camp” has grown to its present proportions, numbering now some\r\n600 souls. The Malays on the Fields came of course originally from\r\nCapetown and Port Elizabeth. They mostly own and drive conveyances, and\r\nbeing also very expert masons are largely engaged in building\r\noperations. As a rule they are very healthy, not more than fifty deaths\r\nhaving occurred since the opening up of the Fields. They are honest,\r\nwell-to-do, benevolent, respectful, affable, strictly sober, and,\r\nbelieving in predestination, they possess a remarkable serenity of mind\r\nin all the vicissitudes of fortune.\r\n\r\nIn Kimberley they have two mosques, one lately built, in which being\r\nMoslems, five times a day, as near as their avocations will permit them,\r\nthey proclaim the two grand principles of their faith, the two grand\r\ndogmas of their religion, “Allah illah Allah Mahomet resoul\r\nAllah”—“There is one God and Mahomet is his prophet.”\r\n\r\nAs a body they follow out their religious observances with commendable\r\nregularity. Imaum Doud, whom I know well, is a most exemplary citizen.\r\nHe has held the position of priest for the last eight years, yet no\r\nspecial respect is shown him on account of his “cloth,” for like all\r\nMoslem priests he is not paid, and has no authority, but is judged and\r\nheld in general estimation simply for his piety and learning. Following\r\nout one of the most important duties of their religion, namely, that of\r\nperforming a pilgrimage to Mecca, which is a duty incumbent on every\r\nMoslem once in his life to perform, unless poverty or sickness prevent,\r\nthe Moslems of Griqualand West have in considerable numbers visited\r\nArabia, no less than twenty having left Kimberley in one party in 1881.\r\nThis a few years ago was a very expensive undertaking, the title of\r\nHadji, which both men and women acquire by this pilgrimage, at that time\r\ncosting each adult about £400. Now, however, rail and steam have reduced\r\nthe expenses of this trip to about £100. Their funeral ceremonies, too,\r\nare carried out with exactness. After life has gone, the dead body is\r\nwashed by one duly appointed, wrapped in grave clothing, no coffin being\r\nused, and then after the Koran has been read all night, the body is\r\ncarried on a bier and buried on its left side in the grave. After\r\ncertain ceremonies have been performed, the friends, wearing no signs of\r\nmourning, return and pray for seven nights in succession in the house of\r\nthe deceased, while for forty consecutive days they religiously repair\r\nto the grave and pray over the remains of the departed.\r\n\r\nThe Moslems like the Jews circumcise their male children; swines’ flesh,\r\nas well as the flesh of most animals forbidden by the Mosaic law, is\r\nalso prohibited. These disciples of Mahomet also believe in good and\r\nevil angels, in the immortality of the soul, in the general resurrection\r\nand judgment of the dead, in future rewards and punishments, and lastly\r\nin Heaven and Hell.\r\n\r\nIn perusing this short description, the question may naturally present\r\nitself to my readers, Whence did these Malays first come into the Cape\r\nColony? I will answer this question very shortly. In the first place\r\nEuropeans, going home from the East Indies, Malacca, Java, Sumatra,\r\nCelebes, the Philippines, etc., used to bring Malays as slaves as far as\r\nthe Cape and there leave or sell them; secondly, the Dutch East India\r\nCo. supplied slaves to the burghers in order to cultivate on a more\r\nextended scale; thirdly, the Cape at that time was a convict station, to\r\nwhich many criminals were transported from the East; and lastly, free\r\nMalays returning from Holland, where they had gone as servants, on\r\nreturn often remained at the Cape, the Amsterdam authorities, in fact,\r\nrecommending this line of action in 1656. It will be seen from this,\r\nthat our Malay population, which numbers one-fifth of the inhabitants of\r\nCapetown, and about one-fifteenth or more of the Diamond Fields (white\r\npopulation), does not necessarily spring from either exiled, slave or\r\ncriminal ancestry.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude this brief description of our Malay fellow citizens, I\r\nmay mention that they are exceedingly tenacious of their civil rights.\r\nAn instance of this came personally within my knowledge. I have told my\r\nreaders in a former chapter, something about the disease supposed by so\r\nmany to be “small-pox,” which ran riot on the Fields in 1884. Now the\r\nCape laws give power to the authorities to build lazarettos and forcibly\r\nremove all persons suffering from infections diseases, if they have not\r\nproper medical attendance and unless they obey strict quarantine laws. I\r\nwas at the time of the last outbreak of so-called small-pox attending a\r\nwell-to-do Malay suffering from the disease, and I took especial care\r\nthat his friends obeyed the law to the very letter, as my patient had a\r\ngreat horror of being dragged from his home, and moreover was determined\r\nthat the officer of the Board of Health should have no excuse for\r\nremoving him. The health officer of the day, however, who was highly\r\nenergetic (for which, so far he deserved due praise, if he was not too\r\njudicious), wishing to show his activity, attempted to drag this man\r\nagainst his will to the lazaretto. I happened very fortunately to arrive\r\non the scene, just as this illegal attempt was being made by that\r\nofficer, who assisted by about thirty police was dragging the sick man\r\namidst the hoots and execrations of an infuriated mob through the\r\nstreets into an ambulance. Knowing the law I at once advised the Malays\r\nto resist his removal pending an appeal to the magistrate, Mr. L. J.\r\nTruter, to whom a statement of the case was immediately sent. The\r\nmagistrate saw at once the unlawfulness of the whole proceeding, gave\r\ninstructions accordingly, and to my intense delight these myrmidons of\r\nthe law who would not, who dare not, have attempted such officious\r\nillegality in the case of an European, had to slink away completely\r\ncrestfallen. The man afterwards recovered, and to show his gratitude for\r\nmy exertions both from a medical and civil point of view, organized the\r\npresentation of a silver cup to\r\n\r\n                          J. W. MATTHEWS, M.D.\r\n               “for his successful efforts in protecting\r\n                        the Mussulman interest.”\r\n\r\nThis was presented to me at a large meeting of Malays in October, 1884.\r\n\r\nA passing word would not be out of place concerning the Indians who are\r\nnow on the fields in considerable numbers, say 700 to 1000 souls.\r\n\r\nThey possess no place of worship, that is the pure Hindu, the believer\r\nin Brahma, Siva and Vishnu, but the Mahomedan division have just built a\r\nmosque and sent specially to India to procure an Imaum who will conduct\r\ntheir services in the future with proper rites. In October, however, of\r\neach year the Mahometan party form large processions and make the air\r\ndiscordant by the beating of “tom-toms.”\r\n\r\nThey celebrate this feast a whole week with allegorical imagery, men\r\npainted and chained like tigers dancing about to harsh music. This forms\r\nnot so much a religious as a historical festival, by which they\r\ncommemorate the murder of two of Mahomet’s sons and at the same time\r\nrejoice at the beginning of another year and keep green the memory of\r\ntheir early days in India.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that all professors or expounders of “Holy\r\nWrit,” are immaculate. Some crave after position and power, some after\r\nease and pleasure, some after luxury and wealth.\r\n\r\nTo the second class I have specified belonged the most eccentric\r\nindividual, who has made a trade of religion, that I have ever met. This\r\n“Apostle of the Faith,” as he called himself, turned up at Du Toit’s Pan\r\nin the year 1876. He was an odd creature, wore black broadcloth, a white\r\nchoker and a bell-topper hat. In those days, a tall beaver was as rare\r\nas was the existence of the conservative working man according to the\r\nimagination of Professor Rogers, therefore “Bishop” Mellett, in his\r\nsingular get up, was quite the sensation for a time among the diggers.\r\n\r\n“Was he a real live bishop?” some asked; “Where was his diocese?” others\r\ninquired; “Was he a greater knave than fool?” “Was he an impostor\r\ntrading upon the artless boer, under the cloak of religion?” These were\r\nqueries with which “his Reverence” was soon confronted. “His Lordship”\r\nwas a short man, of some fifty years, with a good deal of doggedness in\r\nhis weather-beaten features, while every now and then a nervous\r\ntwitching of the lips was evident to the close observer. The wags of the\r\nplace were determined before he left to have some fun at his expense,\r\nand invited him to lecture to them.\r\n\r\nTo this he cordially acquiesced, especially when a dinner to be given in\r\nhis honor was hinted at, to enable him to fortify himself for the\r\noratorical effort he was expected to make. At this dinner, given in the\r\ndining-room of the Royal Hotel, Du Toit’s Pan, there were many visitors\r\nfrom Kimberley, and the high jinks played upon the “bishop,” of which,\r\nby the way, he seemed to be perfectly unconscious, created considerable\r\nhilarity among the jovial crowd. Dinner over a procession was formed,\r\nand a march made to the new billiard-room just being built for a rival\r\nhostelry, the “Fox and Hounds,” where a temporary platform and reading\r\ndesk had been erected for the occasion upon two empty beer barrels.\r\nCandles were stuck here and there around and business immediately began.\r\nThe Chairman appointed was a Dr. Graham, the very broth of an educated\r\nbut rollicking Irishman. Duly introducing the “Bishop,” that reverend\r\ngentleman rose, and at once commenced his lecture, but the “Bishop’s”\r\nknowledge of the English language being very imperfect, he was asked to\r\nspeak in Dutch, which was very humorously interpreted by a Hollander who\r\nwas present. About an hour’s rambling twaddle brought the lecturer to\r\nhis seat, his discourse concluding with the information that he was\r\nprepared to answer any questions concerning Holy Writ which might be put\r\nto him. Many were the questions and curious; the audience relishing the\r\nfun and seemingly vying with each other in their endeavors to confuse\r\nhim, but the question that took the first prize in public opinion was,\r\n“Will His Lordship kindly explain why _corrugated iron_ is sometimes\r\ncalled Gospel Oak?” Well this fairly nonplussed the “Bishop,” as\r\nprobably it will some of my readers. This is one of those jokes that\r\nrequires an explanation. Corrugated iron was the material generally in\r\nuse for building, and the favorite brand was “Gospel Oak,” so-called\r\nbecause the manufacturer’s works, situate somewhere in the vicinity of\r\nLondon, were so named. The efforts of the “Bishop” to explain made the\r\nthing more ludicrous, and just as he was in the throes of a learned\r\ndisquisition upon something or other, out went the candles, upside-down\r\nwas turned the platform, “his Lordship’s” bell-topper became\r\nirretrievably ruined, a few rotten eggs beplastered his sunburnt visage,\r\nand in less time than it takes to tell, the impudent hypocrite was seen\r\nslipping away, hurriedly scrambling through an open window to the rear\r\nof the premises. A “hue and cry” was raised, and the whilom bishop on\r\nbeing run to earth received the rough handling (which did not, however,\r\ngo the length of physical violence) which my readers may imagine he\r\nwould receive from a rough mining crowd. After getting as much fun as\r\nthey wanted out of their victim, the affair wound up by escorting him\r\ninto a neighboring canteen, where everybody, “bishop,” digger, diamond\r\nbuyer, or loafer became just as “fou” as was compatible with walking to\r\nhis respective bed. When the “bishop” got to his room in the hotel,\r\nhowever, a cruel practical joke awaited him. Worn out with excitement\r\nand fatigue he threw himself on his bed to sleep, but pins and needles\r\nhad been stuck all over and at once out he bounded with miraculous\r\nagility. Then came through the open window such a roar of laughter that\r\nthe “bishop” could see further trouble was looming in the distance, and\r\n“discretion” with him “being the better part of valor,” he donned his\r\nnether garments and with coat, handbag, umbrella and bible, he cleared\r\nout as fast through the friendly door as his legs could carry him, and\r\nhas, _mirabile dictu_, never since been seen on the Fields. He was\r\nrecognized, however, some few months ago in the Transvaal still carrying\r\non his pious frauds. In pursuit of his ecclesiastical functions he goes\r\nfrom farm-house to farm-house, staying here a month and there a month,\r\nor as long as the farmer will keep him, and so he plays his hypocritical\r\n“part” among the ignorant and confiding boers.\r\n\r\nGriqualand West has been, until the advent of the railway, at too great\r\na distance from the large towns of the colony to entice many celebrities\r\nto come and see the mines, and visitors, especially those belonging to\r\nthe religious world, have been few and far between.\r\n\r\nSince the opening of the Colesberg Kopje, I can recollect only the\r\nspasmodic visits of one or two Bishops of the English Church, the short\r\nstay of a lecturing infidel and buffoon, whose name I will not advertise\r\nby mentioning, but who was publicly presented with a diamond ring by\r\ncertain gentlemen possessed of more money than brains, the mission of\r\nDr. Somerville in connection with the Society for the Propagation of the\r\nGospel, and the meteoric appearance of Father Henerberry, a second\r\nFather Matthew, who for fourteen days filled the Roman Catholic church\r\nto overflowing by his powerful crusade against drink. For some twelve\r\nmonths past the Salvation Army has been established, but contrary to\r\nexpectations has attracted comparatively little attention of either a\r\nfavorable or opposite character.\r\n\r\nI should be shirking an evident duty if I were to omit calling attention\r\nto a matter which must ever hear witness against Kimberley and the\r\nsurrounding camps, and that is the opportunity which for years the\r\nreligious section of the inhabitants have thrown away of spreading the\r\ntruths of the Gospel to the natives,[92] who have been attracted to\r\ntheir very doors from the far interior. I am within the mark when I\r\ncompute that during the last sixteen years an average of at least 10,000\r\nnatives (new arrivals) has each year been drawn to work in our mines by\r\nthe reports, carried from one to another by those returning, of the\r\nriches awaiting them. What a field for missionary enterprise has not\r\nthis presented? Now, has not the chance been lost? What “glad tidings of\r\ngreat joy” might not even one or two in whom the seed thus sown had\r\nborne fruit, have spread on their return?\r\n\r\nI am glad to notice, however, that at last proper advantage of this vast\r\nfield for the propagation of the truths of the Gospel is about to be\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nOne important point must not be overlooked: every man in Kimberley even\r\nnow is but a bird of passage, merely drawn by the chance of making money\r\nquickly as the first arrivals were, and then escaping from a place which\r\npossesses very few social attractions, and, in respect of natural beauty\r\nand comfort of dwellings, none—the impossibility of getting away felt by\r\nsome, the desire for further accumulations evinced by others, keeping\r\ntogether a mixed and heterogeneous population such as could scarcely be\r\nfound in any other country.\r\n\r\nThe rising generation is mostly to be pitied, doomed to spend their\r\nyoung lives in a place which in South Africa at least can only be\r\nexceeded in wretchedness by the Namaqualand copper mines. No trees, no\r\ngrass, no carolling birds, no rippling brooks. Nature seems paralyzed or\r\ndead. No wonder the seeds of early piety are all blown to the winds,\r\nwhen God’s day is desecrated by the sight of the open offices in the\r\ndiamond market (although fortunately on that day no business can be\r\nlegally transacted), by the noise of continuous blasting in the mines,\r\nand the sight of railway drays laden with fruit and flowers running\r\nthrough the streets. At times the man of strong religious instincts\r\nfeels sick at heart, and for the moment thinks that money alone is\r\nthought of—_Regina Pecunia_, the “Almighty Dollar,” the sole deity\r\nadored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII.\r\n LAW AND LAWYERS ON THE FIELDS.—LAW IN THE EARLY DAYS.—ABSENCE OF CRIME\r\n     AT THAT EPOCH.—THE MUTUAL HALL.—MAGISTERIAL JURISDICTION.—THE\r\nATTORNEY-GENERALSHIP.—ATTORNEYS AND LAW AGENTS.—A SUDDEN DEATH.—CURIOUS\r\n         NOMENCLATURE OF KAFIRS.—THE FATE OF “BRANDY AND SODA.”\r\n\r\n\r\nDean Swift says: “Law is a bottomless pit; it is a cormorant, a harpy\r\nthat drowns everything.” And believing implicitly in his words, I will\r\nnot weary my readers with any elaborate disquisition on the legislative\r\nenactments, etc., which served to make up the law under which we lived\r\nin the early days of the Diamond Fields. Suffice it to say, that to me\r\nit seemed a very medley of inconsistency, an olla podrida, a thing of\r\nshreds, of patches, making “confusion worse confounded.” Roman, Dutch,\r\nEnglish Common. Colonial Statute Law and Proclamations of the local\r\ngovernment were blended—no, I should rather say flung together in a\r\nfashion so devoid of system as to be absolutely chaotic. The laws of\r\nGriqualand West since annexation are now identical with Colonial Laws,\r\nwith the exception of a few local enactments, but at the time they were\r\n_sui generis_, or rather, if I may be allowed, _omnium genorum_,\r\nhomogeneity being remarkable for its entire absence. It speaks well for\r\nthe contented nature of the diggers, that complaints against this\r\nanomalous condition of things were so little rife.\r\n\r\nIn the early days, a genuine brotherly feeling reigned among the diggers\r\nat Colesberg Kopje (Kimberley Mine), and though of course an occasional\r\nquarrel would arise, yet as a rule there was universal amity existing.\r\n\r\nSuch a crime as robbery was, for a long time, scarcely known. The digger\r\nleft his tent all day with the entrance flaps merely tied down, and\r\nreturned at night from his work in the mine with no apprehension as to\r\nthe security of his goods and chattels. In those halcyon days, with\r\nscarcely an exception, the natives, who are often unjustly accused of\r\nnaturally possessing thieving propensities, established the falsehood of\r\nthe charge by living an honest and laborious life, faithfully carrying\r\nout their master’s behests, and never robbing him of a single\r\nsplint.[93]\r\n\r\nIt is my firm conviction, (and it will be admitted that I have had\r\nextensive opportunities of judging), that the native laborers, who have\r\nbeen flocking at the rate of 30,000 per annum to the Diamond Fields,\r\nare, as a rule, sober, upright, and virtuous before they have been\r\ncorrupted by the white men, who induce them to steal, or are demoralized\r\nby drinking the liquor supplied them by white men. Had it not been for\r\nthe unscrupulous scoundrels who first introduced illicit diamond buying,\r\nand for the almost indiscriminate sale of liquor to natives, they would\r\nin all probability be still as honest as at the early period, when,\r\nexcept in trivial assault cases, they were very rarely brought before\r\nthe Court.\r\n\r\nKimberley, at this time, was without any building set apart as a High\r\nCourt. When the Judge came from Barkly on circuit, he sat in a large\r\nbuilding called the Mutual Hall, which used to serve a variety of\r\npurposes, being fitted up for theatrical entertainments, which were\r\nfrequently given there, while religions services were also held in it\r\nfrom time to time. I remember a trial for murder taking place in this\r\nbuilding before Mr. Recorder Barry, the first judge on the Diamond\r\nFields. The alleged facts of the case were briefly as follows: The\r\naccused, a man and a woman, had thrown the husband of the latter down\r\nthe mine—the supposed motive for the crime being that a guilty intrigue\r\nwhich existed between them might be continued without interference. The\r\ndiscovery of certain suspicious circumstances had led to their arrest\r\nand committal.\r\n\r\nAll through the day the Judge and jury had sat hearing the evidence, but\r\nvery few of the public had attended. As, however, night came on, and it\r\nbecame known that the Judge purposed sitting till the case was\r\nconcluded, the Hall was quickly crowded with diggers.\r\n\r\nHere were men begrimed with dust and coatless as they had hurried there,\r\nmen who had removed the signs of their daily toil; the floor of the Hall\r\nwas thronged so that none could move; on the window-sills stood men\r\nclinging to each other for support, and to the very girders of the roof\r\na number of adventurous youths had climbed; a veritable sea of faces met\r\nthe eye, as one gazed around. On the stage sat the Judge surrounded by\r\nthe tawdry wings. Some were associated in the spectator’s minds with\r\noccasions widely different from the background. A glimmering light was\r\nshed by a row of flimsy Chinese lanterns suspended above, and on the\r\nJudge’s desk were a couple of glittering dips. In front sat the counsel\r\nat a table of rough planks, elevated chair high on liquor cases, and\r\nbehind them were the prisoners mounted on boxes stamped with the\r\nbattle-axe trade-mark, and bearing the inscription, Henessey’s XXX. As\r\nthe night wore on, the excitement grew intense; the feelings of the\r\npublic were dead against the prisoners, perhaps scarce a score in that\r\nvast crowd had a doubt as to their guilt or wished them to escape the\r\nmurderer’s doom. The addresses of the counsel and the charge of the\r\nJudge were listened to in breathless silence, and then the wearied jury\r\nretired. Apparently some doubt existed in their minds, for the verdict\r\nof Not Guilty was returned.\r\n\r\nThe present High Court in Kimberley is a lofty and extensive building\r\nconstructed of brick and stone, but for years after the Mutual Hall had\r\nbeen abandoned as a temple of Justice, the Judge or Judges sat in a\r\nwretched, tumble down shanty, which is still occupied by the Special\r\nCourt for the trial of offences against the Diamond Trade Act.\r\n\r\nThe Resident Magistrate’s Court was the favorite arena of litigants in\r\nthe early days, as there under Special Proclamations cases involving\r\n£500, when there was an acknowledged debt, and £250 in matters of\r\ndisputed debt or damages, might be tried in a speedy and summary manner\r\neminently satisfactory to those who abhorred the “law’s delays.” This\r\nextensive jurisdiction has since been largely reduced, with the result\r\nof vastly increased costs and other serious inconveniences to the honest\r\nman, who has unfortunately become entangled in the meshes of the law.\r\n\r\nThe first Recorder of the High Court of Griqualand West, as I have just\r\nsaid, was Mr. now Sir Jacob Dirk Barry, a scholar and jurist of no mean\r\npretensions, and it is not too much to say that at each critical period\r\nof the history of the Fields, as the tent burnings and the rebellion\r\nalready described, it was largely owing to Judge Barry’s firmness and\r\nearnestness in the endeavor to maintain obedience to law and order, that\r\nconsequences which might have proved disastrous in the extreme were\r\nhappily avoided. After Mr. Barry left there were several judges and\r\nacting judges appointed, until, annexation having taken place, a court\r\nof three judges was formed, of which Mr. Justice Buchanan was made\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nOf the first Attorney General, Mr. John Cyprian Thompson, I have but\r\nlittle to say, as ill-health almost from the time of his appointment\r\nprevented him from taking an active part in public affairs. To the\r\nsuperstitious it would have seemed as if there was a bar upon the\r\nAttorney-Generalship; since annexation the Crown Prosecutorship of\r\nGriqualand West, Mr. J. C. Thompson’s successor, Mr. S. G. Sheppard,[94]\r\nafterwards Judge and at present Administrator of the Crown Colony of\r\nBritish Bechuanaland, his relations with the other members of the\r\nExecutive becoming somewhat strained, tendered his resignation. Mr. J.\r\nS. Lord, Q. C., who succeeded him, gave up his office in preference to\r\neither having to submit to undue interference in the performance of his\r\noffice or else living in a continual state of “protest;” the next, who\r\nwas the first Crown Prosecutor, was removed from his post, but hitherto\r\nthe gentleman at present holding the appointment has maintained his\r\nrelationship with the Attorney General without friction.\r\n\r\nBut in no British Colony, I should think, have so many enforced or semi\r\nenforced changes taken place among officials as in Griqualand West. In\r\nthe short space of a decade there were three Resident Magistrates, a\r\nClerk of the Peace, two Commissioners of Police and a Chief of the\r\nDetective Department, who were either removed from their respective\r\noffices or deemed it advisable to resign.\r\n\r\nAs my readers may conceive, the Diamond Fields attracted a certain\r\nnumber of barristers, many of whom must have made large sums of money.\r\nThe fees paid by illicit diamond buyers, when a barrister was engaged\r\nfor the defence, were, I believe, something enormous. These cases were\r\nbut a small source of income compared with the long protracted lawsuits\r\nthat used formerly to arise between various wealthy claim-holders, and\r\nsubsequently after the claims had been put into companies between these\r\nbodies. In the early days there was a court specially established to\r\nadjudicate upon claims to unoccupied land situate in Griqualand West,\r\nand here several gentlemen of the long robe picked up gold and silver\r\nwith rapidity. The cases from which the lawyers perhaps derived most\r\nemolument was a civil action brought by Isaac Sonnenberg and Edward\r\nEager Hurley against Alfred Ebden, the registered proprietor of the farm\r\non which are situated Kimberley mine and town—and another brought on\r\nbehalf of the London and South African Exploration Co., Lim., against\r\nthe government. In the first case Messrs. Sonnenberg and Hurley sought\r\nto oust Mr. A. Ebden from his farm on the ground that they had bought a\r\nprior and preferent claim, but their enterprise signally failed. In the\r\nlatter case, the company gained their point and compelled the government\r\nto disgorge some portion of the rents and license moneys, which they had\r\nimproperly received and retained.\r\n\r\nOf attorneys there were enough and to spare, and their manner of\r\nconducting business, at least in the early days, was decidedly unique.\r\nThe one grand characteristic that distinguished them was a phenomenal\r\nand perennial thirst, and the manful efforts which they made to quench\r\nit were worthy of a better cause. Should a clerk omit to dot an “i” or\r\ncross a “t,” your attorney would at once propose an adjournment to the\r\nnearest canteen while the error was being rectified. Was a case won? So\r\njoyful an occasion demanded a copious libation. Was a case lost? A cup\r\nof consolation was forthwith quaffed. Was a compromise agreed on? The\r\nprospect of renewed amity between the whilom litigants was surely worthy\r\nof a foaming bumper.\r\n\r\nThe “Green Bar”[95] was the green room of the Judicial Theatre. I have\r\nfrequently even known adjournments of the Magistrate’s court for the\r\nevident if not the avowed purpose of liquidating some abstruse point of\r\nlaw. There was a vast amount of “bluff,” as it is vulgarly termed, and\r\ntall talk on the part of the attorneys in those days. I remember upon\r\none occasion, a leading member of the side bar describing a respectable\r\nwitness as having come into the court with the Bible in his hands and a\r\nlie on his lips, while the passages at arms between the practitioners\r\nseemed often acrimonious to a degree; but when the court rose, the feuds\r\nwere forgotten and the contending parties again sped to the “Green Bar,”\r\nwhich possessed for them an absolutely magnetic attraction.\r\n\r\nOf the law agents, a genus I think peculiar to South Africa, and in\r\nthose days, at least, admitted without having to give the most\r\ninfinitesimal proof of their legal knowledge, I shall not say much. Some\r\nwere very good men and fair lawyers, but as a rule they consisted of\r\n“ne’er do wells,” who having failed in every thing turned to the law as\r\na _dernier ressort_. The worst of them had no education, no brains, and\r\nno money, their sole stock in trade being an absolutely unlimited amount\r\nof arrogance which enabled them to prey upon the public. A few men of\r\nthis class were, until recently, still to be found on the Diamond\r\nFields.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for juries were needlessly troublesome. Many classes of\r\npersons being exempt, the drawing for juries pressed heavily on the poor\r\ndigger, who, while compelled to wait day after day in the precincts of\r\nthe court, was beset with fears, not improbably well grounded, that his\r\n“boys” (native laborers) were appropriating to their own use any diamond\r\nthey might discover. Despite the unpleasantness and loss entailed by\r\nserving on a jury, few diggers neglected to answer to their names.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason the lawyers were not generally long-lived. I saw a\r\nlist made out by a legal friend of mine, when in a somewhat gloomy frame\r\nof mind the other day, according to which some twenty had died since the\r\nopening of the Diamond Fields.\r\n\r\nI cannot help here mentioning the sudden end of one of the leaders of\r\nthe Bar at the time, and a man well known in South Africa. I was an\r\neye-witness of the tragic occurrence. Mr. Advocate Walker, many years\r\nprior to the opening of the Diamond Fields, had enjoyed an extensive and\r\nlucrative practice in Natal, and at the time of which I am now speaking\r\nwas conducting the defence of a case in which I was interested. Driving\r\nhome from my consulting-room on the evening of the day before which the\r\ncase was expected to be called, I pulled up at Mr. Walker’s house to\r\nhave a final consultation on some points I thought of importance. I\r\nfound him smoking his cigar by the fire, looking somewhat unwell, but\r\nwithout anything in his appearance to lead me to anticipate the awful\r\ncatastrophe impending. I put my questions to him, and for an answer, Mr.\r\nW. extending his arms remarked, “Don’t bother, certain to win\r\nto-morrow.” As he uttered the last word, he gave a sudden start, bounded\r\nfrom his seat, while from his mouth a jet of bright crimson blood\r\nspurted against the wall opposite. For him to-morrow came not. He never\r\nspoke again. An aneurism of the heart had given way and in a few seconds\r\nhe was a corpse. Ever since that melancholy event, I have experienced a\r\nsense of no little uneasiness when the probable results of “to-morrow”\r\nhave been discounted “to-day.” As the poet says “to-morrows cheat us\r\nall,” and thus it was in the case of poor Walker.\r\n\r\nOn mentioning this incident to a friend of mine he drew my attention to\r\nthe following exquisite lines, which I think are worthy of reproduction\r\nhere:\r\n\r\n             “We will gather flowers to-morrow,\r\n               When the mist of rain is o’er,\r\n             When the air is warm and sunny,\r\n               And the tempest howls no more.”\r\n             But the flowers are parched and faded,\r\n               For the clouds have passed away,\r\n             And we leave them still ungathered,\r\n               Though to-morrow is to-day.\r\n\r\n             “We will climb the hills to-morrow,\r\n               In the morning cool and bright:\r\n             Who could scale those rugged mountains\r\n               In the noontide’s scorching light?”\r\n             But the snow-wreaths clothe the summits.\r\n               And the mists hang chill and gray,\r\n             And we leave the slopes untrodden,\r\n               Though to-morrow is to-day.\r\n\r\n             “We will lend an ear to-morrow\r\n               To our fallen sisters’ woes;\r\n             We can scarcely hear their voices\r\n               While the music comes and goes.”\r\n             But along the thorny highway\r\n               Still with weary feet they stray,\r\n             And we pass them by, unheeding,\r\n               Though to-morrow is to-day.\r\n\r\n             “We will leave our work to-morrow,\r\n               And with eager hands and strong,\r\n             We will lead the little children\r\n               Far away from paths of wrong.”\r\n             But our hands grow old and feeble,\r\n               And the work goes on for aye,\r\n             And the little children perish,\r\n               Though to-morrow is to-day.\r\n\r\n             “We will raise our eyes to-morrow\r\n               To the cross on Calvary’s brow;\r\n             At our feet the gold is sparkling,\r\n               So we cannot heed it now.”\r\n             But we clutch the glittering fragments,\r\n               ‘Mid the dust, and mire, and clay,\r\n             And we cannot raise our eyelids,\r\n               Though to-morrow is to-day.\r\n         BROWN ROBIN.—_From Chambers’ Journal, March 19, 1887._\r\n\r\nI may here, though not strictly connected with this subject, call\r\nattention to the strikingly curious names adopted by many Kafirs working\r\non the Diamond Fields, and give some instances of the manner in which\r\nthey attract public notice. Natives are by no means destitute of a sense\r\nof humor,[96] and very often when they have been working for an employer\r\nof passionate disposition, and have been addressed by him in no\r\ncomplimentary terms, they voluntarily retain as their appellation some\r\nabusive title, or strong objurgation of which he has made use in the\r\ncourse of his remonstrances. I have not infrequently known a magistrate,\r\non asking a native prisoner his name, to receive the reply “G—d d—mn” or\r\n“Bl—dy Fool;” while one unfortunate fellow, when asked the same question\r\nin the charge office promptly answered, “Go to H—l,” and it was not\r\nuntil he had been twice or three times knocked down for his apparent\r\ninsolence, that the Sergeant discovered that the native had simply given\r\na truthful if startling answer to the question put to him. Such names as\r\n“Cape Smoke” (_i.e._, Colonial Brandy), “Pontac” and other alcoholic\r\nterms are not uncommon, while “Sixpence” is one of the most favorite\r\nnames of the natives.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most singular illustrations of the eccentric\r\nnomenclature to which I allude, and the strangely incongruous\r\ncircumstances under which instances of it occur, was given in the High\r\nCourt some two or three years ago. The anecdote serves as an example of\r\nhow, even in matters of most solemn, nay tragic import, a ludicrous\r\nelement may be present.\r\n\r\nA native named “Brandy and Soda” had been tried for murder and found\r\nguilty, if I recollect rightly, before Mr. Justice Buchanan, the Judge\r\nPresident. Awful as is the sentence, and heartless as the man must be\r\nwho can hear it pronounced unmoved, yet many, by no means devoid of\r\nhumanity, for a moment smiled, as the Judge, having assumed the black\r\ncap, thus addressed the prisoner: “Brandy and Soda, you have been found\r\nguilty by an impartial jury of the awful crime of wilful murder, upon\r\nthe enormity of which it is unnecessary for me to dilate. ‘A life for a\r\nlife’ is the law for both the black man and the white, and there is no\r\nalternative left me but to pronounce on you the sentence of death. The\r\njudgment of this court is that you, Brandy and Soda, be hanged by the\r\nneck till you are dead, and may,” etc.\r\n\r\nIn concluding these few remarks relative to the legal profession, I\r\nwould disclaim any wish to infer that lawyers are not a necessity, far\r\nfrom it, but they are a necessity with which one would fain dispense. I\r\nwould not wish to imply that the lawyers of Griqualand West are more\r\nunreasonably exacting than their brethren in other places, but this\r\nobservation cannot be regarded as fulsome adulation or extravagant\r\neulogy. It will, however, be evident. I could not advocate so extreme a\r\nmeasure as that proposed by Dick to Cade, “The first thing we do, let’s\r\nkill all the lawyers.”[97]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n     A SERIOUS ACCIDENT.—FELSTEAD’S.—DR.

The medical practitioners of the Diamond Fields were\r\nat the time for months in a state of the utmost excitement over the\r\n_quæstio vexata_ of small-pox or no small-pox, and although the weight\r\nof evidence and the opinions of those whose qualifications and\r\nexperience almost served to carry conviction was certainly in favor of\r\nthe latter theory, yet on the opposite side were ranged, besides those\r\nto whom the public attributed (I trust and believe wrongly) interested\r\nmotives, some men of undoubted ability in their profession and above the\r\nsuspicion of maintaining the scare for the sake of their personal\r\nadvantage. The authorities were naturally more or less in doubt also,\r\nfor “who shall decide when doctors disagree?” and many were the\r\ncommissions of doctors dispatched by Government to visit “Felstead’s,” a\r\nfarm some eight miles from Kimberley, where a temporary hospital was\r\nerected, all natives coming from the Transvaal examined, and those found\r\nsuffering from the disease isolated. On the morning of December 1, 1883,\r\nDr. L. S. Jameson, one of the most able physicians in the Diamond\r\nFields, in accordance with the request of government, drove out to the\r\nplace in order to make an official report.\r\n\r\nOur inspection over, we re-entered the vehicle and set out on our way\r\nhome to breakfast, when my horses became unmanageable and dashed amidst\r\na herd of cattle, with the result that the cart was overturned and Dr.\r\nL. S. Jameson thrown out with immense force some fifteen yards, happily\r\nwithout sustaining any hurt, while I was less fortunate, for though I\r\nfell out close beside the vehicle, I received such serious injuries\r\n(involving extravasation of blood upon the brain) that I remained for\r\nfour or five days perfectly unconscious, and on coming to my senses\r\nfound myself in the Carnavon Hospital, suffering from paralysis of the\r\nright side. Here let me briefly thank Mr. Denis Doyle, the able and\r\nenergetic Sanitary Inspector of the Kimberley municipality, for the\r\ngreat and invaluable services which he rendered to me, so I am told, on\r\nthe morning of my accident, by providing relays of natives to carry me\r\nto the hospital. I would also warmly thank those members of my own\r\nprofession, especially Dr. L. S. Jameson, who took on himself the sole\r\nresponsibility of my case, for their unremitting attention: the good\r\nsister Henrietta and kind sisters and nurses of the hospital, and the\r\npublic of the Four Camps, who exhibited an earnest solicitude as to my\r\ncondition, that deeply touched me and that I shall never forget.\r\nImmediately on my recovering sufficient strength to move about, I\r\ndetermined to take a tour through the Transvaal, a country that I had\r\nlong been desirous of visiting, and I booked a seat for Pretoria in the\r\ncoach leaving Kimberley on December 31, 1883. My friends, however, not\r\nthinking me strong enough to travel, caused me much vexation, by\r\ningeniously contriving that I should miss the coach, and in consequence\r\nmy journey was postponed for another week. However, I took good care\r\nthat their over-solicitude, as I thought it, should not make me miss the\r\ncoach a second time, and I left on January 7th.\r\n\r\nJust as I was sitting in the coach, preparing to start, a bundle of\r\nletters was placed in my hand, including one from my wife, who was then\r\nvisiting our children in Germany. Curiously enough this letter was\r\nwritten on the very day after my accident, and contained the following\r\nrequest, “Let me know if anything, however trivial, has happened to you\r\nto-day. I have a strange feeling that something, I know not what, has\r\noccurred, which makes me intensely anxious.” I do not intend to draw any\r\ndeduction from what, after all. may have been a mere coincidence, but\r\nthe facts, nevertheless, are as I have stated.\r\n\r\nHow many times before T returned to Kimberley, if my pride would have\r\nallowed me, should I not have freely admitted the folly of my journey!\r\nTo a man who had sustained a shock to his nervous system such as I had,\r\nthe bumping for nearly a fortnight in a four-horse coach along primitive\r\nSouth African roads, was naturally not the best course of curative\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nLeaving Kimberley early in the morning a long stage brought us to a\r\nroadside inn, which was, and is, I believe, kept by M. Grandier,\r\nformerly a trooper in Weatherly’s Horse during the Zulu war.\r\n\r\nTaking out the horses we rested here some time, and I persuaded Mr.\r\nGrandier, whom I had met in Kimberley, to tell me the story of his\r\nnarrow escape at Zlobani Mountain during the war with Cetywayo. The\r\nfacts of his escape, as he related them to me, are indeed stranger than\r\nfiction. “I was a trooper,” said Mr. Grandier, “in Weatherly’s Horse,\r\nand I shall never forget the morning of the 28th of March, 1879, and the\r\nattack of the Zulus at Zlobani. Ah! Mon Dieu, Colonel Weatherly was a\r\nfine man; we worshipped him, and would have followed him to the jaws of\r\ndeath. It took us most difficult work to get to the top of the mountain;\r\nwe were at it all night, but we accomplished it. We stopped at the top\r\nan hour or two, when Colonel Buller perceived the black hordes in\r\nthousands just like monkeys, climbing up on all sides to hem us in. The\r\nColonel told us to get down as quickly as we could, and did not we ride!\r\nI shall never forget the last sight of my beloved old Colonel; the\r\npicture is still in my mind. It seems but yesterday I saw him in the\r\ndistance surrounded by howling Kafirs, all hope lost, covering his son,\r\na bright, fair-haired lad of fifteen, from the cruel assegais of his\r\nbrutal foes. I jumped down the sides of rocks as big as this house, my\r\nlittle horse always landing on its legs, and at last, after many escapes\r\nfrom the Zulus, got safely to the bottom. Five or six of our fellows at\r\nonce got hold of my stirrups, seized my horse’s tail, nearly dragging\r\nhim to the ground, and so weighted the poor brute that he was done up in\r\na mile or two, and I had to leave him. What did I do? I ran like the\r\ndevil and managed to hide myself in some tall grass, when, as night was\r\ncoming on, I thought I was safe. Four Zulus, however, spied me out; it\r\nwas no use my resisting, so they seized and stripped me of everything. I\r\nnever could tell why they did not kill me; the only thing they did was\r\nto drive me on in front of them, telling me to ‘hambake.’ Every moment I\r\nthought my last. After walking some miles, we stopped at the kraal of\r\nUmbelini, an ex-Swazi chief, half-way up the valley, who was one of\r\nCetywayo’s adherents. How I wondered what would happen next! Naked as I\r\nwas, they tied me to a post, when the women tore round me as if mad,\r\nspat in my face, and pulled out my beard, while the men formed a circle,\r\nand yelled and danced about me like very fiends! This lasted far into\r\nthe morning, when, half dead from fatigue and terror though I was, a\r\nZulu, who could speak a little Dutch, raised my hopes of life by telling\r\nme that I was meant as a present to Cetywayo. Resting a little they\r\nstarted me off with an escort, to a place which I afterwards found to be\r\nUlundi, Cetywayo’s head kraal. I can assure you I was as naked as when I\r\nwas born, and the broiling sun in the day and the cold at night almost\r\ndrove me mad. At Cetywayo’s I was treated just as badly as at\r\nUmbelini’s. The women again acted as perfect devils from the pit below.\r\nCetywayo was disappointed with me, did not believe I was unable from\r\nweakness to handle the two guns that he showed me and which had been\r\ntaken at Isandhlwana. He told me to get back to Umbelini’s kraal (for\r\nthe worst I presumed) as he found me of no use. Starting back with two\r\nKafirs as a guard, at the close of the day I felt completely exhausted,\r\nwhen they allowed me to rest close by a mealie field on the banks of a\r\nstream. Fortunately for me my guards were nearly as much wearied as\r\nmyself, and only too glad to take a rest. One sat down to snuff, while\r\nthe other went to fetch water. A sudden idea struck me, and, making a\r\nregular leap for life, I jumped and seized an assegai lying on the\r\nground, and in less than no time stabbed the Zulu who was engaged in\r\nsnuffing, right through the heart. Then snatching one of the rifles that\r\nthey had with them, I waited for the Zulu returning with the water, who,\r\nas soon as he caught sight of me, bolted into the long grass, leaving me\r\nfree once more. The excitement gave me fresh strength to begin another\r\nfight for life, and, to make a long story short, in two or three days,\r\nafter a desperate struggle, I got back to the camp at Kambula, much to\r\nthe surprise of my comrades, who for eighteen days had given me up as\r\nlost. For weeks I suffered much from the exposure, but recovered\r\nsufficiently to get to Ulundi in time for the finish. I shall never,\r\nhowever, forget or get over _my_ introduction to Cetywayo.”\r\n\r\nThe story and our lunch being finished, on we went to Christiana, my\r\nonly companion in the coach being a Mr. Fowler, who was engaged by some\r\nEnglish capitalists to report on certain properties in the Transvaal\r\nsaid to be auriferous. Obviously plain and straightforward, his manner\r\ncommanded confidence, and his report of the places which he was\r\nspecially engaged to examine, as I afterwards heard, was not of the\r\nglowing color that distinguished others which were made to home\r\ncapitalists, by perhaps personally interested experts, as I then\r\nbelieved.\r\n\r\nSome few miles from Christiana, our next resting-place, we crossed the\r\nVaal River, which is here a broad flowing stream some 200 yards in\r\nwidth, and continuing along its bank for some miles we arrived there at\r\nabout seven o’clock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BRONKHORST SPRUIT.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe coach was soon surrounded by the villagers, its arrival being looked\r\nupon as _the_ event of the week.\r\n\r\nAmong the throng that came to meet the coach, I saw several gentlemen\r\n(?) whom I recognized as former residents of Kimberley, who had sought\r\nanother sphere on account of the strictness of Ordinance 48, 1882\r\n(Diamond Trade Act), and who were pursuing their peculiar line of\r\nbusiness in a place where they were safe from the annoyance of\r\ninquisitive detectives asking unpleasant questions, and had chosen\r\nChristiana for their abode as being the nearest village in the Transvaal\r\nto the border of Griqualand West.[98] As soon as the coach stopped, we\r\nwere pounced upon by a Health Officer, who forced us into a little\r\ntriangular shed, reeking with burning brimstone, in order to fumigate\r\nus, the absurd idea having spread to the Transvaal that a couple of\r\nminutes’ exposure to sulphur fumes would kill the germs of small-pox,\r\nand so lessen the chance of our bringing this dreaded infection with us.\r\n\r\nThe official in question was not over exacting. He assured me in strict\r\nconfidence, that the small-pox scare in Kimberley was nothing but a\r\n“doctor’s rush,” and to prove to us his belief in what he said, he was\r\ncontented with a merely formal inhalation on our part of the unpleasant\r\nsmoke, thus satisfying his conscience that he had done his duty. Two\r\nhotels, one or two stores, the Landtrost’s office and a few straggling\r\nhouses, comprised everything that was to be seen.\r\n\r\nLeaving this place, for six hours[99] until we arrive at Bloemhof, the\r\nroad ran alongside the Vaal River. All the inhabitants of this small\r\nvillage, which was of about the same type as Christiana, were fast\r\nasleep when we drove up, so we merely remained there long enough to\r\nchange horses.\r\n\r\nThis place leaped into notoriety some fourteen years ago, in consequence\r\nof being selected as the scene of the famous Bloemhof arbitration,\r\notherwise known as the Keate award, a definition of boundaries which\r\nsatisfied nobody. A handful of burnt brick houses, here one and there\r\none with a plastered front, glaring out like spectres in the hazy\r\nmoonlight and revealing a Gehenna of desolation and dust, is all that\r\nremains, so far as this Sleepy Hollow is concerned, “photographically\r\nlimned on the tablets of my mind, when a yesterday has faded from its\r\npage,” as Gilbert (W.S., not the esteemed Kimberley attorney) observes\r\nin a well-known Bab ballad.\r\n\r\nStopping two or three times for the same purpose, first at Clarkson’s\r\nstore, in front of which there is an immense lake some miles in\r\ncircumference, and again at Maquassie’s Spruit, sixteen hours more\r\njolting brought us to Klerksdorp, one of the most charming little\r\nvillages that I have seen in this country. The pretty houses nestling\r\namong the fruit trees, and the roadside inn so clean and so comfortable,\r\nrecalled pleasant memories of many an old English village.\r\n\r\nImmediately before our arrival here we played the principal parts in a\r\nreproduction of the laughable farce “Fumigation.” as performed with such\r\nimmense success in Kimberley, Christiana, etc. Here, however, the\r\nperformance was decidedly unsuccessful, both the players, stage managers\r\nand prompters being far too sleepy to care whether anybody’s choking in\r\nthe sulphurous exhalations of the “property” brazier was realistically\r\nrendered or a hollow mockery. Six hours more and we drove at a gallop\r\ninto Potchefstroom, and drew up at the Royal Hotel. Learning the time\r\nthe coach would start for Pretoria, and that I should have but three\r\nhours to look around, I started off at once to see the town, first\r\nattracted by the stately trees, towering at least sixty feet high, which\r\nlined the principal streets, giving an air of staidness and solidity to\r\nthe little town, and at the same time inspiring an idea of well-to-do,\r\nif slightly humdrum, respectability and quietude, such as may be\r\nobserved in many a New England village. The substantial brick built\r\nhouses, too, surrounded by beautiful shrubs and graceful willows, the\r\nclear water from the Mori River running in sluits through every street,\r\nformed a striking contrast to the iron houses, the debris heaps and the\r\ndusty parched-up place that I had but two days left behind. Passing\r\nReid’s store, which stands at one side of a market square, at least\r\ntwenty acres in extent, with a plain and unimposing church. in the\r\ncentre. I made my way to the Court-House at the opposite corner of the\r\nsquare, which, on the breaking out of the war, was one of the places\r\nheld by our troops.\r\n\r\nThough nearly two years had elapsed since the cessation of hostilities,\r\nthe place showed the signs of the past struggle, by its general air of\r\ndesertion, and the poverty-stricken appearance of a whilom-beleagured\r\ntown. On making my way in, I could see by the marks all round how the\r\nplace had been riddled by bullets, and could imagine the hot fire to\r\nwhich it had been exposed. The hole in the door was pointed out to me,\r\nthrough which the bullet sped which killed Capt. Falls, on the very\r\nfirst day of the attack by the Boers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COURT-HOUSE AT POTCHEFSTROOM, DEC., 1880, AFTER THE SIEGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter Capt. Falls’ death Colonel Clark, now Her Majesty’s representative\r\nin Basutoland, took command, and with the thirty-five men he had with\r\nhim defended the building for three days, until the Boers fired the\r\nroof, and he was forced to surrender on December 20th.\r\n\r\nThe Boers, elated to a degree, outraged every rule of war, sentenced the\r\nmen who had capitulated to hard labor and forced them to work in the\r\ntrenches which they (the Boers) were digging in front of the fort, where\r\nsome of our troops had taken shelter, and which they were defending.\r\nThere, exposed to shot and shell, several lost their lives, killed by\r\nthe bullets of their comrades in the fort, who knew them not. I next\r\nvisited the fort itself, which had been the scene of so many painful\r\nevents. In a space but twenty-five yards square were crammed during the\r\nsiege nearly 300 souls, of whom about 100 only could bear arms, and here\r\nmen, women and children remained cooped up from the date above mentioned\r\nuntil they surrendered on March 20th, evacuating the fort on the 23d. In\r\nthe rear of the fort a stone enclosure was pointed out to me containing\r\nthe graves of those who died during the four months’ siege. There is no\r\ndoubt Cronjé, the Dutch commander, ought to have been severely brought\r\nto task, as he was guilty of a decided breach of the rules of war, in\r\nthat he never informed the garrison, which when it surrendered had only\r\na few rotten mealies left, of the armistice which had been agreed upon\r\nafter Majuba, on the 6th of March, news of which he received in\r\nPotchefstroom on the 12th, and was published in the _Staats Courant_ on\r\nthe 16th. During the siege our losses were: one officer killed and four\r\nwounded, twenty-five rank and file killed, and forty-one wounded. The\r\nsurvivors after the surrender were marched to the Free State border and\r\nliberated.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that Potchefstroom, which at one time, when the\r\nTransvaal was divided into two Republics, was one of the seats of\r\ngovernment, lost much by the war. When I was there all the men of\r\nbusiness with whom I conversed, told me that property had immensely\r\ndepreciated in value, and while walking round the town I myself saw\r\nproofs of this in the many houses that were tenantless: but although Mr.\r\nRobert Acult of the firm of Reid and Co., the largest merchants of the\r\nplace, told me that business was decidedly reviving, yet the\r\nnon-reappearance of any banking institutions since the war told me its\r\nown tale. One thing, however, I noticed, that to all appearance a\r\nfriendly feeling seemed to exist among all classes.\r\n\r\n“Time and tide wait for no man,” so the frantic blasts from the driver’s\r\nbugle announced the readiness of the coach for departure. Taking our\r\nseats, off we started for Pretoria at eleven o’clock—\r\n\r\n              “Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,\r\n              Never were folks so glad;”\r\n\r\nfor now at last we began to see “the beginning of the end.” The journey\r\nfrom Potchefstroom to Pretoria is excessively wearisome, and the country\r\nvery level and tame. We saw nothing worthy of recording, unfortunately\r\npassing the celebrated caves of Wonderfontein[100] in the night—nothing\r\nto break the monotony of our journey, save the periodical changing of\r\nour horses, nothing to occupy our attention but the oft-repeated\r\narguments, whether or not there was any improvement in the team, or the\r\ndiscussion whether time had been gained or lost. In fact we all felt an\r\nincessant longing for our journey’s end.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at Pretoria we drove at once to the Post-Office to deliver\r\nthe mails, then going round to the principal hotel, Up with the lark, I\r\nmade the round of the main part of Pretoria before breakfast. Just in\r\nfront of the hostelry where I was stopping, the Market Square extended\r\nlike a large grass plot, very little business evidently being transacted\r\nthere, as grass was growing nearly all over. At one end there was a\r\nlarge Cathedral in course of erection,[101] which I was told would cost\r\n£20,000, and will be a decided ornament to the town when finished. The\r\nstreets were all at right angles, lined in many places with large gum\r\ntrees, while the houses, neat and cosy, had pretty, well-kept gardens in\r\nfront, between which the rose hedges were blooming in prodigal\r\nprofusion. I saw no public buildings in the place worthy the name. The\r\ngovernment offices and banks, built merely of brick, had no pretensions\r\nto architecture whatever. Every thing seemed in a state of utter\r\nstagnation, very different, I was told, to the state of affairs under\r\nBritish rule, when building was going ahead and trade and speculation\r\nwere brisk.\r\n\r\nGold was the theme of conversation at every meal, and seemed to have\r\nattracted to the place the few strangers whom I met at the hotel, mere\r\nspeculators either in prospective gold concessions, or engaged in\r\nexamining and certifying to the richness of gold fields about which,\r\nbefore they even had made an inspection, the “straight tip” had been\r\ngiven them as to the kind of report expected.\r\n\r\nHere, visiting the capital town of the Transvaal, it was impossible not\r\nto look back and think over the causes which led to the late war. Any\r\nimpartial observer of men and things could come to no other conclusion\r\nbut that, if Sir Theophilus Shepstone had remained in the Transvaal, and\r\nhad been allowed to finish that which he had so well commenced, the\r\nTransvaal would have been a British possession to-day. Sir Theophilus\r\nShepstone, if not known personally, yet at least by name was familiar to\r\nevery farmer in the State. There is no doubt that President Burgers was\r\ndriven, at the time of Sir Theophilus Shepstone’s arrival, almost to\r\ndespair. With a dissatisfied people, no money in the Treasury, the\r\nSekukuni expedition a failure, Sir Theophilus Shepstone appeared on the\r\nscene just at the right moment. As proof of this, read Mr. Burgers’\r\nspeech in the Volksraad in March, 1877:\r\n\r\n“You have lost the country by your own stupidity. It is not this\r\nEnglishman, or that Englishman, it is you—you! who have sold the country\r\nfor a soupie.[102] It is now too late, you have become a danger, and a\r\nnuisance, and, like Turkey, your prostrate carcase is infecting the air.\r\nEngland now says, as she said to Turkey, ‘Remove it at once, remove it,\r\nor we shall do it at your cost.’”\r\n\r\nPresident Burgers again, in the very last speech he ever delivered to\r\nthe members of the Volksraad, out-Heroded Herod in his disappointed (?)\r\nfrankness—in fact the Transvaal’s most bitter foe could not have spoken\r\nmore openly.\r\n\r\nThis is the peroration of his speech on that eventful occasion:\r\n“Gentlemen, I may say in conclusion that when you want presidents, when\r\nyou want doctors, when you want clergymen, when you want surgeons, when\r\nyou want any educated men whatever, you have to get them from abroad;\r\nbut whenever I bring forward measures for railways, for education, and\r\nfor other necessary advancements, you refuse to pass them or pay for\r\nthem. I say emphatically your independence is not _to be_ lost, but _is_\r\nlost.”[103]\r\n\r\nYet if Mr. Burgers had then or at any moment held up his little finger,\r\nSir T. Shepstone _must_ have gone back. Instead of that Mr. Burgers,\r\nknowing he would never be reelected President, saw in the arrival of the\r\nEnglish an opportune solution of the difficulties of the Executive, and\r\nthis, to my mind, was the secret of his advising the Boers not to\r\nresist, but simply to “Protest! protest, and never cease protesting!”\r\n\r\nNo wonder, in after years, the Transvaal Boers were furious and looked\r\nwith disgust upon Mr. Burgers and his action and words, when they\r\nlearned that in 1878 Sir Bartle Frere gave orders that Mr. Burgers was\r\nto be paid an allowance of £500 per annum, with arrears from April 12th,\r\n1877, the day on which Sir T. Shepstone issued his Proclamation, taking\r\nover the country. This, when it became known in 1879, was looked upon by\r\nthe Boers as a bribe to Mr. Burgers, and at any rate my readers must\r\nagree with me, that this allowance should have been paid out of Imperial\r\nfunds, as the country was taken over for Imperial purposes.\r\n\r\nAristotle in his “Politics” states that revolutions are produced _by_\r\ntrifles, but not _out of_ trifles. The revolution in the Transvaal was\r\nprecipitated by a trifle, but that trifle was led up to by a series of\r\nblunders to my mind quite unpardonable. The trifle to which I allude was\r\nthe harsh treatment (as it was at the time considered by the Dutch) in\r\nthe Potchefstroom district of a man named Bezuidenhout, who was summoned\r\nfor certain taxes amounting to £27 5 0. Refusing to pay, his wagon was\r\nseized, and on the day appointed for its sale in the local market,\r\nBezuidenhout drove it away in face of the authorities to his farm, and\r\nCommandant Haaf was sent to arrest him, but found him too well supported\r\nby his friends and had to retire. On account of this, the great mass\r\nmeeting at Paarde Kraal was held on December 8th, 1880, which lasted\r\nuntil the 13th, when the Boers formed the solemn resolution of fighting\r\nfor their independence.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Sir Theophilus Shepstone, in an address which he issued\r\nshortly after his arrival, addressed “To the Burgers of the Transvaal,”\r\nin April, 1877, he thus appealed to them:\r\n\r\n“Some of you were among the old pioneers, many of whom I knew as\r\nacquaintances, and not a few as friends. Others of you are children of\r\nthose who belonged to that adventurous band, but who have passed away.\r\n\r\n“Practically, I am an Africander, as you are proud to call yourselves. I\r\ncan speak in your language, and have spoken to hundreds of you on the\r\nsubject of my mission. I therefore know the feelings of those who are\r\nagainst it as well as those who are for it.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Has not the war with Sekukuni, whom you all consider to be but an\r\ninsignificant enemy, and which is not yet settled as was supposed, dealt\r\na fatal blow to the prestige of the Republic, to its financial\r\ncondition, to its government, and to the credit of the country, and has\r\nit not caused disaster and ruin to many families which your government\r\nfound itself powerless to remedy? You all know as well as I do, that it\r\nhas.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“You are surrounded inside and outside your boundaries by at least one\r\nand a half million of natives, none of whom have been made firm friends\r\nby your past intercourse with them, and of these one of the weakest has\r\ndealt you a deadly blow. It follows, therefore, that you can neither sow\r\nnor reap except by the tacit permission of the native population, and\r\nthey have lost the respect for you which they had for the pioneers.”\r\n\r\nThis plain unvarnished language had its effect. He was cordially\r\nreceived, and Her Majesty, in her prorogation speech, addressed to\r\nParliament on the 14th of August, was able to say, “The Proclamation of\r\nmy Sovereignty in the Transvaal has been received throughout the\r\nprovince with enthusiasm. It has also been accepted with marked\r\nsatisfaction by the native chiefs and tribes; and the war, which\r\nthreatened in its progress to compromise the safety of my subjects in\r\nSouth Africa, is happily brought to a close.”[104]\r\n\r\nBut concerning Sir Owen Lanyon, who followed Sir Theophilus Shepstone,\r\nthe Boers knew nothing, and regarded him with suspicion. Then again his\r\ntraining was against him—he was too autocratic, too self-willed, his\r\nmilitary style of discipline too severe, and these qualities, which were\r\nrapidly rendering him unpopular even as Administrator in Griqualand\r\nWest, he still retained, and manifested in his new and larger sphere.\r\n\r\nSir Owen Lanyon was sworn in as Administrator of the Transvaal on March\r\n4th, 1879, and during the very next month he begged Sir Bartle Frere,\r\nthen in Natal, to come to Pretoria, and assist him in arranging affairs\r\nwhich were beginning to look serious. In fact from his arrival to his\r\ndeparture on April 8th, 1881, he was over-handicapped. Sir Owen Lanyon,\r\nto judge from his conduct in the Transvaal, seemed to think it necessary\r\nto remove all those who had supported Sir Theophilus Shepstone, and put\r\nhis own men in their place.\r\n\r\nThe Hollanders, an important element, were exasperated by the removal of\r\ntheir countryman, Dr. Kissik, from the post of District Surgeon, to make\r\nroom for an old Diamond Field favorite; the barristers were insulted by\r\nthe appointment of an Attorney General ignorant of the Dutch language,\r\nand a man upon whom they looked down as merely a newspaper reporter, and\r\nan attorney’s clerk; and lastly, the entire country was aroused when, in\r\nface of direct promises to the contrary, Mr. De Wet, Recorder of\r\nGriqualand West, was raised to the post of Chief Justice over the head\r\nof Mr. Kotzé, who had the confidence and admiration of all parties.\r\n\r\nWhile all these apparent trifles were accumulating, there was silently\r\ngrowing up a spirit of flunkeyism, which seems innate in English people.\r\nThe Transvaal is essentially republican, and such a spirit was utterly\r\nunsuited to the ideas of the inhabitants. One correspondent in the\r\nTransvaal wrote to me at the time—“sycophancy and subserviency are in\r\nthe ascendant, good independent men are shunted to make way for those\r\nwho know how to truckle to the powers that be.”[105]\r\n\r\nSir Bartle Frere at once acceded to Sir Owen Lanyon’s request. Arriving\r\nin Pretoria from Natal on the 10th of April, 1879, after several\r\nconferences with the Boers, he almost reconciled them to annexation by\r\ntelling them that they should have as free a constitution as their\r\nbrethren in the Cape. Sir Garnet Wolseley, however, came out, superseded\r\nSir Bartle Frere in the High Commissionership for South East Africa, and\r\narriving just too late for Ulundi, and the overthrow of Cetywayo, came\r\nto the Transvaal, and was sworn in as Governor on September 29, 1879.\r\nSir Garnet spoke just as strongly as Mr. Gladstone (whom I will quote\r\nanon) had written, concerning the impossibility of our retiring from the\r\nTransvaal, and both at Wakkerstroom, Standerton and Pretoria assured his\r\nhearers that the Transvaal would remain British “as long as the sun\r\nshone.”\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury a constitution of merely government and nominee\r\nmembers was formed, which was laughed and jeered at by nearly the entire\r\ncountry, both Dutch and English.[106]\r\n\r\nAt this time the _Volkstem_, the organ of the Boers in Pretoria, urged\r\nthe farmers not to give any excuse to Sir Garnet Wolseley to attack\r\nthem, but simply to protest, passively resist, and follow out President\r\nBurgers’ advice in March, 1877, when he told them “Have patience, your\r\nplan is to protest, keep on protesting, and ‘alles zal recht kommen.’”\r\nThe Dutch followed this advice for a time, as they did not forget the\r\nsuccess which attended these tactics in Holland 300 years before, when\r\nunder Counts Egmont and Horn, in 1566, they managed by a series of\r\nprotests, to Madrid, to rid themselves of the Spaniards and Spanish\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nSir Garnet Wolseley then went home, and Sir Pomeroy Colley in March,\r\n1880, succeeded him as High Commissioner for South Eastern Africa.\r\nEvents rapidly culminated. On December 13th, the Triumvirate of Kruger,\r\nJoubert, and Pretorius being formed (Lanyon in Pretoria still being\r\nnominal administrator of the country), three commanders were organized,\r\none of which went and met the 94th Regiment at Bronkhorst Spruit,\r\nanother to Potchefstroom, where it besieged the Court-House and Fort,\r\nwhile the third made Heidelberg its headquarters.\r\n\r\nSo the war commenced.\r\n\r\nThe three months’ siege or investment of Pretoria by the Boers was a\r\nvery tame affair indeed, the state of alarm the place was in being\r\nnothing but the direct consequence of the Boer success at Bronkhorst\r\nSpruit, which I shall presently describe. As soon as conductor Egerton\r\nbrought into Pretoria the account of the disaster at this place, a grand\r\nmeeting of the townspeople took place, and Sir W. Owen Lanyon at once\r\nplaced Pretoria under martial law, all Dutch sympathizers being allowed\r\nbut half an hour’s grace to clear out, bag and baggage; the Convent, the\r\ngaol close by with its yard, and the military camp were fortified, and\r\nto these places all the inhabitants of the town, about 3,000, were\r\ncompelled to remove, and leave their homes to the mercy of any intruder.\r\n\r\nDr. Dyer, the District Surgeon of Pretoria under the Lanyon\r\nadministration, in former years a practitioner at the Diamond Fields,\r\nand who when I saw him in Pretoria held the same appointment under the\r\nBoer government, very kindly spent the whole of Sunday morning in\r\ndriving me around and pointing out the principal places of interest, at\r\nthe same time giving me most interesting personal reminiscences of the\r\nsiege, during which he was principal Civil Medical Officer. We drove\r\nfirst to the old military camp, and saw the long parallel rows of\r\nbarrack buildings, built during the British occupation, but which then\r\nwere all empty and forsaken. “It is impossible,” the Doctor said, “to\r\npicture what we went through, or to realize the contrast between the\r\nthronged busy place this was during the siege and the silence of\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\nIndeed it would be difficult to find a valid excuse for the action of\r\nthe authorities at all in dragging the inhabitants away from their\r\nhouses and homes, and penning them up like sheep together, were it not\r\nthat a species of panic had come over all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTION OF MAMPOER, NOV. 22, 1883.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch was the terror and excitement existing that, although Pretoria had\r\na garrison of 2,000 effective men, reckoning regulars and volunteers,\r\nyet a force of at the most 600 Boers kept them and the inhabitants shut\r\nup for months, like rats in a cage. This garrison made one or two\r\nsorties. On the 16th of January they had a fight at Elandsfontein, of\r\nwhich the less said the better, and another on February 12th, at Red\r\nHouse Kraal, situated the other side of the Six-mile Spruit, on the road\r\nto Natal. This was a Majuba in miniature; our troops, showing the white\r\nfeather, made a regular skedaddle. Nixon, who has written a most\r\ninteresting work on the Transvaal, and who was in Pretoria at the time,\r\nsays he saw our men running away down the hills into Pretoria, as hard\r\nas their legs could carry them. Eighty Boers made 200 red coats take to\r\ntheir heels, and the remainder of a column, 900 strong, were, to the\r\ndisgrace of our arms, ordered to retire. The Boers formed a supreme\r\ncontempt of the “Rori Baajtes.” These disastrous occasions, though such\r\nexceptional instances in the long and glorious annals of British arms,\r\nsuffice in no way to tarnish their brilliant lustre in the eyes of those\r\nbetter acquainted with European history than these uneducated Dutch\r\nfarmers. But to return to my sight seeing. After leaving the late\r\nmilitary camp, we went to the gaol. This is very well kept, and in\r\nfirst-rate order. I walked round and saw the additions which had been\r\nmade to the yard during the siege, all now merely mementoes of the past.\r\nAmong the prisoners in the gaol, my attention was drawn to one tall,\r\nprincely looking native pacing his cell and clanking his chains with an\r\nair of haughty disdain. This was no other than Niabel, alias Mapoch, who\r\nwith another chief, Mampoer, had been sentenced to death by the\r\nTransvaal government, but reprieved.\r\n\r\nThe story of Sekukuni’s murder, Mampoer’s execution and Mapoch’s\r\nimprisonment, reads like a novel. Sequati, a Bapedi chief on the\r\nnortheastern border of the Transvaal, had two sons, Mampoer, a son by\r\nthe royal mother, and Sekukuni, a son by a wife of inferior rank. They\r\nfought for the succession, when Sekukuni being victorious usurped the\r\nthrone and Mampoer fled to Mapoch, a small chief in the Transvaal. As\r\ntime went on Sekukuni would not pay taxes to the Boers.\r\n\r\nJohannes, a petty chief, with whom in former years he had been on bad\r\nterms, but who, having made up the dispute, now resided near him, was\r\nthe first to rebel against the Boers. Mampoer assisting them. Johannes\r\nwas killed and his tribe utterly broken up. The Boers, following up\r\ntheir success, tried to subdue Sekukuni, but failed, their Amaswazi\r\nallies having left them, being utterly disgusted with their (the Boers’)\r\ncowardice.\r\n\r\nPresident Burgers then went to the front himself, but all in vain.\r\nDeserted by the burghers, who raised the now proverbial cry of “huis\r\ntoe,”[107] and broken-hearted, without adherents, without money, he had\r\nto return to Pretoria and leave Sekukuni virtually master of the\r\nsituation. This ultimately led to Burgers’ downfall and the assertion of\r\nBritish authority, and here he learned from painful experience that “the\r\nBoers were not those of the great Trek, and he himself was not Ketief,\r\nMaritz, Pretorius the elder, or even Paul Kruger.”\r\n\r\nAfter the British annexation of the Transvaal, Sekukuni did not come to\r\nany settlement, so when Sir Garnet Wolseley arrived in September, 1879,\r\nafter the dethronement of Cetywayo, he at once sent a special envoy,\r\ndictating terms to Sekukuni, which the latter refused. This at once led\r\nto an attack upon his stronghold, which Sir Garnet Wolseley stormed and\r\ncaptured, supported by sixteen companies of infantry. 400 mounted men,\r\ntwo or three guns and 10,000 Swazi levies under Mampoer, and Sekukuni\r\nwas taken prisoner. He remained prisoner as long as the English retained\r\npossession of the country, but the Boers specially stipulated for his\r\nrelease in the now celebrated convention of Pretoria (Article 23).[108]\r\nWhen Sir Garnet Wolseley gave Mampoer back the country which Sekukuni\r\nhad usurped, knowing well that Sequati his father had in former years\r\nproclaimed him chief, Mampoer took over one of Sekukuni’s young girls\r\nfor himself; but on Sekukuni’s release and return in terms of the\r\nconvention, he demanded her back, and this led to another fight, wherein\r\nSekukuni was killed. The Boers now accused Mampoer of murder and called\r\nupon him to surrender himself, but instead of this he took refuge with\r\nMapoch, with whom the Boers had also a quarrel, as he would not\r\nacknowledge them or pay taxes. War was now declared against Mapoch\r\n(Niabel), who defended himself bravely for many months; but at last,\r\nworn out by hunger and want, he and 8,000 of his men, who were\r\nafterwards “apprenticed” into slavery, surrendered, and Mampoer and\r\nMapoch both found themselves prisoners of war.[109]\r\n\r\nThey were tried and sentenced to death, and although Mr. Hudson, the\r\nBritish Resident, pressed upon the Boer Executive the desire of the\r\nEnglish government that capital punishment should not be carried out, no\r\nnotice was paid in the case of Mampoer, the sentence of Mapoch alone\r\nbeing commuted.\r\n\r\nMampoer with his dying breath said, “I have fought Sekukuni for the\r\nDutch, I have fought him for the English, and now I am hanged for doing\r\nmy duty.”\r\n\r\nPoor fellow! his execution was a sad, brutal exhibition. Pretoria was\r\nfull, even on my visit, of the accounts of the scene, how the rope round\r\nhis neck broke, how he was hoisted again into position, and how the day\r\nof his execution was looked upon by the Boers as a gala day, and an\r\nopportunity of exhibiting their independence of the “verdomde\r\nEnglishmen.” Even photographic art was called in to perpetuate this\r\nofficial murder, the accompanying view of the execution being openly\r\nsold in the streets of Pretoria.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Niabel, he knew I was an Englishman and a stranger, and by\r\nhis manner evidently wished to show me plainly the contempt in which he\r\nheld his captors. Leaving the gaol, Dr. Dyer drove me all round the\r\noutskirts of the town and then put me down at my hotel. Next day Mr. S.\r\nMarks, the managing director of the Eerste Fabrieken, a large distillery\r\nabout nine miles from Pretoria on the Pienaars River, and who had been\r\nthe originator of the French Diamond Mining Co. at Kimberley, kindly\r\ndrove me out to see the factory. Immediately on crossing the Pienaars\r\nRiver, after an hour and a half’s pleasant drive, the distillery,\r\nmalt-kilns and stores appeared in sight. The building, 210 feet long, 90\r\nfeet broad, and four stories high, was fitted up with the most powerful\r\nmachinery made on the latest principles, and contained as well large\r\nstore-rooms for spirits and grain. Every class of work I found done on\r\nthe premises.\r\n\r\nThe establishment indeed made quite a village in itself. A fine block of\r\nbuildings opposite the distillery contained the offices, store-rooms for\r\nmaterial, carpenters’, blacksmiths’ and coopers’ shops, farm laborers’\r\nhouses and stables. More than this, the company had large tracts of land\r\nunder cultivation, with oxen, cows, horses, and mules in numbers,\r\nfarming being a branch of the business. After looking over the\r\ndistillery I spent an agreeable half hour tasting the various liquors\r\nand liqueurs. These numbered at least forty, and were manufactured from\r\nfour kinds of grain—mealies, rye, barley, and Kafir corn, and then\r\nflavored.\r\n\r\nMr. Stokes, the manager, was exceedingly kind, and invited Mr. Marks and\r\nmyself to dinner in the evening, when I had the pleasure of becoming\r\nacquainted with his charming and accomplished wife. I could have fancied\r\nmyself at the West end of London, in the midst of civilization, not in\r\nthe centre of the Transvaal. The appointments of the table, the English\r\ntrained waitresses, and the cooking were perfection. After coffee and a\r\ndelicious cigar, we retired for the night, but I felt it would take a\r\nlong time to efface from my mind this unexpected little glimpse of\r\nrefinement and culture. On my return to Pretoria next day, I asked Mr.\r\nFox, formerly a large Imperial contractor during the Zulu war, who had\r\ninvited me to dine with him, to advise me where I could get horses and a\r\nconveyance to take me as far as the battlefield of Bronkhorst Spruit,\r\nwhen he very kindly offered to drive me there himself if I would start\r\nearly next day, as that happened to be the only day he could spare from\r\nhis many business engagements. I jumped at the chance, and, making all\r\narrangements to start in the morning, I went to bed early in order to\r\nget a good night’s rest before this little drive of eighty-four miles.\r\nMr. Fox, however, had some difficulty in arranging his horses, and we\r\ndid not get away until ten o’clock. Driving out of Pretoria we had an\r\nextensive view of the lovely town. It was the middle of summer, and the\r\ntrees and fields looked so pretty and so green, and the rose hedges in\r\nfull bloom so lovely, I was perfectly enraptured, and fancied myself in\r\nold England again. Nothing of particular interest presented itself as we\r\nwent along. The country for miles undulated in grassy plains, here and\r\nthere diversified by ranges of hills. We passed the Eerste Fabrieken on\r\nour left, Mr. Steuben’s beautiful place “The Willows” on our right, when\r\npushing along the horses, only outspanning for an hour in the veldt\r\nabout half-way, arrived on the scene, so memorable at least in South\r\nAfrican history, at five o’clock in the afternoon. Crossing Bronkhorst\r\nSpruit, the ground gradually rises, and on the right-hand side of the\r\nroad, dotted here and there with mimosa and thorn trees, a very gradual\r\neminence is formed, which was the point of vantage taken by the Boers in\r\nintercepting our troops en route from Leydenburg, and about to\r\nconcentrate in Pretoria.\r\n\r\nI had thoroughly posted myself in the occurrences of that eventful day,\r\nwhich I will shortly relate. The 94th Regiment, together with camp\r\nfollowers, numbering 267 souls in all, forming a cavalcade a mile and a\r\nquarter in length, was slowly dragging its way to Pretoria, when on\r\napproaching Bronkhorst Spruit at about half-past two o’clock in the\r\nafternoon of the 20th of December, 1880, certain mounted Dutch scouts\r\nwere seen galloping along the top of a ridge near by. These men brought\r\na message, requesting Colonel Anstruther, who was in command, not to\r\nadvance any further pending an answer from Sir Owen Lanyon to an\r\nultimatum which had been sent him. This he refused, when, without\r\nfurther ado, the Boers, about 500 strong, opened at once a murderous\r\nfire upon our men, who were totally unprepared for so sudden an attack.\r\nDown the bullets rained like hail, and our men, who lay on the ground\r\nwithout a particle of shelter, were picked off with deadly precision,\r\nuntil Col. Anstruther himself, mortally wounded, and most of his\r\nofficers hors de combat, seeing the day was lost, surrendered to the\r\nBoers, after a fight lasting just twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nAfter inspecting the ground and the relative positions the Dutch and\r\nEnglish occupied during this short but disastrous fight, we visited the\r\ntwo principal places where our fallen soldiers lie buried. The larger of\r\nthese we found enclosed by a high stone wall about eighteen yards long\r\nby twelve yards broad, and shaded by two beautiful mimosa trees. Here\r\nlay the last remains of fifty-eight N. C. officers and men of the 94th\r\nRegiment, and one N. C. officer, and one private Army Service Com.\r\nkilled, as the tombstone erected to their memory states, in action on\r\nDecember 20, 1880. In another and smaller graveyard, some 100 yards\r\nnearer Pretoria, the officers who fell are buried. The wall surrounding\r\nthese graves had just lately been repaired by order of the English\r\ngovernment, and, as if purposely planted to keep the sun’s scorching\r\nrays from burning up the green grass waving over them, another large\r\nwild mimosa tree threw out the protection of its flowering branches.\r\n\r\nI have good reason to remember my visit. Wishing to see the graves and\r\nread the inscriptions on Col. Anstruther’s tomb and those of the various\r\nofficers buried alongside him, I clambered to the top of the wall about\r\nfour feet in height, when in my weak state I reeled over, fell inside,\r\nand, fenced in as it were, it was some half hour before my companion,\r\nwho himself had lost the use of one leg, was able to get me out. Here\r\nlie buried together five out of the nine officers who were in charge of\r\nthe 94th Regiment, which as I said before was proceeding from Lydenburg\r\nto Pretoria. I had leisure enough you may imagine to copy their names.\r\nNeat little crosses at the head of each grave showed the burial-places\r\nof Lieut. Col. P. K. Anstruther, Capt. T. McSweeney, Capt. N. McLeod\r\nNairne, Lieut. H. A. C. Harrison and E. T. Shaen Carter, transport\r\nstaff. The four officers who escaped with their lives were Capt.\r\nElliott, for whose subsequent and bloody murder in crossing the Vaal\r\nRiver two Boers were tried in Pretoria but acquitted; Lieut. Hume, Dr.\r\nWard, and conductor Egerton, who, it will be remembered, had the good\r\nfortune to reach Pretoria in safety, with the regimental colors wrapped\r\nround his waist, being allowed by the Boers after the fight to proceed\r\nthere in order to obtain medical assistance. Surgeon Major Comerford and\r\nDr. Harvey Crow, the latter now in practice in Pretoria, whom I had the\r\npleasure of meeting, went out immediately on Mr. Egerton’s bringing in\r\nthe disastrous news, and attended to the wounded.\r\n\r\nSuch was the precision of the Boer fire, as Dr. Crow told me, that the\r\nbullet wounds averaged five per man; truly “every bullet” in this case\r\nhad “its billet.”\r\n\r\nThe Boers had evidently taken especial care to choose the ground and\r\nmeasure the distance before our wagon-train appeared in sight.\r\n\r\nI was told on good authority that many of our soldiers’ rifles were\r\nfound after the fight actually sighted at 800 yards, whereas 300 would\r\nhave been nearer the mark, and that this accounted for the few disasters\r\namong the Boers, who only acknowledged, at all events, to one man having\r\nbeen killed outright, to one dying of his wounds, and to five who were\r\nwounded but recovered.\r\n\r\nIt was just the same at Majuba, the sighting of the rifles of our men\r\npicked up by the enemy being woefully incorrect; it is therefore not\r\ndifficult to account for the smallness of the Boer losses there also.\r\n\r\nCol. Anstruther, who was in command, lingered six days, until death put\r\nan end to his sufferings, dying in his tent, as Dr. Crow told me, in\r\npresence of Drs. Comerford, Ward, and himself. Even in his official\r\ndispatch, written on his deathbed, Col. Anstruther never accused the\r\nBoers of having acted unfairly in the fight, although a rumor to that\r\neffect was freely circulated.\r\n\r\nDr. Crow wrote at the time a most touching account of his burial. He\r\nsaid, “Words fail to describe a scene so sad and so unique. The remains\r\nwere placed on a stretcher and carried by four sergeants, three out of\r\nthe four being wounded; while the majority of those who followed were\r\nwounded too, some on crutches, others wearing splints, others with\r\nbandaged heads, and some unable to walk, were carried on the backs of\r\ntheir more fortunate comrades. At the grave not a dry eye could be seen,\r\nand one and all seemed to think that a friend, a good man, and a\r\nsoldier, in the widest and best sense of the term, was gone for ever\r\nfrom their midst.”\r\n\r\nMr. Nellmapius, the Portuguese Vice Consul, whose acquaintance I had\r\nformed on the diamond fields, and Mr. John Gray of Transpoort, who years\r\nbefore I had known as a sugar planter in Natal, with a few others, did\r\nall they could for the wounded, who for four months were kept and\r\nattended to under canvas.\r\n\r\nThe Boers, it is said, showed a good deal of kindness and attention to\r\nour wounded immediately after the fight; but a friend of mine who was\r\nthere at the time, and with whom I discussed the question of the Boers\r\nand their motives, assured me they did not treat our wounded kindly from\r\nany feelings of sympathy, but from a fear of after consequences, should\r\nthe tide of war flow against them, and it was that reason which made\r\nthem leave us alone after the fight to sink or swim as best we might,\r\nwithout let or interference.\r\n\r\nTurning our horses’ heads homewards, we just managed to drive a few\r\nmiles on the road to Pretoria when darkness overtook us, and we\r\noutspanned near some Dutch wagons which were going up to Sekokoni’s\r\ncountry. I received great kindness from the Boer in charge, who, seeing\r\nI was far from well, insisted on my taking a sleep in his wagon until\r\nthe moon rose, which it did about four o’clock in the morning, enabling\r\nus to continue our journey.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be reported concerning the incivility and churlishness of\r\nthe Boers, I only speak from my own experience when I say that during\r\nthe whole of my trip I received nothing but kindness at their hands. I,\r\nhowever, treated them with proper courtesy, not as an inferior race,\r\nwhich so many English upstarts do, did not order when I should ask, nor\r\nforget that the farmer was to a certain extent my host. These Dutch\r\nfarmers have become uncivil in their own defence. A good deal is due to\r\nthe diamond fields, and the different classes they have attracted. On\r\nthe coach arriving at a Dutch farm-house, where as a favor its\r\npassengers were allowed to rest, some among them would, too often, take\r\nunpardonable liberties, would order round the inmates, enter the\r\ngardens, break off branches of the trees, steal the fruit if ripe, if\r\nunripe pelt each other with it from sheer wantonness, and leave when\r\nthey had caused the farmer all the damage and annoyance they could. No\r\nwonder that in time all strangers were treated alike with abrupt and\r\nscant courtesy. Pushing along when the moon rose, we drove to Zwart\r\nKopje, close to which there is a nice farm-house surrounded by splendid\r\nfruit trees. This was the place where the first fight took place after\r\nBronkhorst Spruit. Zwart Kopje at the time was a very strong position,\r\nbut our troops were successful in dislodging the Laager which the Boers\r\nhad formed there, losing, however, six men in the attempt, while our\r\nenemies lost three. Here we took a good rest; intending to make the\r\n“Eerste Fabrieken” the last stage before Pretoria; we did this and then\r\nresting a short time at Mundt’s farm, seeing some pretty girls and\r\neating some delicious fruit, we arrived at Pretoria about six P. M.,\r\nafter a most delightful and interesting trip.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say that sleep soon fell upon me, but dreams of cruel\r\ndisappointment, broken faith, ruined prospects, shattered fortunes,\r\ndisgrace and despair, haunted me the livelong night, and when morning\r\nbroke, I woke up with the stern fact forcing itself upon me, that all,\r\nalas! was but too true, the vivid dreams of the night being but\r\nphantasms of the day’s sober realities.\r\n\r\nEven in Mr. Gladstone’s political manifesto, previous to the last\r\ngeneral election but one, he thus attempted to excuse his disgraceful\r\nsurrender to the Boers after the defeat at Majuba: “We have been\r\nseverely condemned because, after supplying military means such as to\r\nplace beyond doubt the superiority of the British power, we refused to\r\nprosecute a work of sanguinary subjugation.”\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Gladstone could write such misleading words, in the face of his\r\nown previously expressed opinion, in face of the distinct and positive\r\nanswer he made Mr. Rylands in the House of Commons on January 22, 1881,\r\nthat, “it was the resolute intention of the government to establish the\r\nBritish supremacy in the Transvaal in the first instance,” in the face\r\nof Bronkhorst Spruit, Laing’s Nek, Tugogo, and Majuba, four defeats,\r\nwhich entirely put an end to the belief in British superiority, not only\r\nin the minds of the Boers, but also in those of the natives, is\r\ndifficult to understand.\r\n\r\nThe retrocession of the Transvaal will remain a blot on the Gladstone\r\nescutcheon which no amount of sophistry will ever be able to wipe out.\r\n\r\nMy medical friends were very kind; the luncheons, dinners, and suppers I\r\nate, and the genial society I enjoyed at their hospitable boards, I\r\nshall never forget.\r\n\r\nThe mail cart I learned started for Natal the next evening, so I spent\r\nthe day in taking my farewells and in preparing for my journey. The mail\r\nwas, however, delayed, and did not leave until two o’clock in the\r\nmorning, Dr. Crow very kindly sitting up to see me safely away. At last\r\nwe started for Pieter Maritzburg, when bidding the genial doctor “Good\r\nbye” and Pretoria adieu we rattled away at full gallop, with 450 miles\r\nof South African road before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX.\r\n            LEAVE PRETORIA.—A TRYING SITUATION.—HEIDELBERG,\r\n    STANDERTON.—MICHAELSON’S.—BOER CAMP AT LAING’S NEK.—MAJUBA ONCE\r\n   MORE.—NEWCASTLE.—MARITZBERG, PLOUGH HOTEL.—D’URBAN.—VOYAGE TO THE\r\n         CAPE.—CURIOUS MENTAL PHENOMENON.—RETURN TO KIMBERLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mail cart by which I left Pretoria was so arranged that the\r\npassengers sat back to back, but as there was the driver besides myself\r\nonly. I was obliged to sit at the back to preserve the balance. Feeling\r\nvery weak I tied myself in with a rope, which, having passed round my\r\nwaist, I fastened to either side of the tent of the cart, so that\r\nwhatever might happen, I could not be thrown out. The road to Six Mile\r\nSpruit was very smooth, the night dark, and being dead tired out, I fell\r\nto sleep at once; Morpheus, however, did not long hold me in his arms,\r\nfor my slumbers were soon disturbed. I was suddenly awakened to the fact\r\nthat something had gone wrong. Collecting my scattered senses, I saw at\r\nonce that the driver had outspanned the horses, and tied them up, two to\r\neach wheel, where, neighing and kicking with fright, they were pulling\r\nand swaying the cart about in opposite directions to get loose, till at\r\nlast over it went, and all four horses tore themselves free and broke\r\naway at a bound. Fortunately uninjured, yet unable to get out by myself,\r\nI laid tied up fast in the cart, until at dawn of day the driver, who\r\nhad been sleeping in the stable of a farm-house close by, came to inspan\r\nagain. Seeing the cart upset, the horses gone, he naturally looked to\r\nsee where I was, and releasing me from my awkward predicament, went to\r\nseek for his horses. The farmer himself next appeared on the scene, one\r\nof the fattest, jolliest, old fellows I have ever met. He paid me more\r\nkind attention than I could ever have expected, and insisted on my going\r\nto his house, where we drank cup after cup of coffee until the sun was\r\nwell up. Von Schalkveigh, for that was his name, once an Old Colony\r\nfarmer, had been loyal to the backbone during the war.\r\n\r\nAt last, the horses being found, my driver made up for lost time, and\r\nafter two or three changes of animals, we drove up to the “Royal Hotel”\r\nat Heidelberg just as the rain was commencing to pour in torrents.\r\n\r\nThis is a neat village of about 250 inhabitants. The Blesbok Spruit,\r\nwhich nearly encircled it, formed quite a picture in the foreground,\r\nwhile the background was filled up by the hills over which we had just\r\ncome. Heidelberg had always been described to me as an oasis in the\r\ndesert, my informants applying that term to it both from its natural\r\nbeauties and from the geniality of its residents. It did not take me\r\nlong to find out it was a colony composed almost entirely of thrifty,\r\nwell-to-do Scotchmen, who had chosen, with considerable cuteness, the\r\nbest position for miles round on which to settle.\r\n\r\nMr. MacLaren, the “institution” of the place, a prosperous merchant, and\r\nI can say without fear of contradiction one of the most hospitable\r\nScotchmen in South Africa, invited me to lunch. His kindness to the\r\nEnglish officers brought here as prisoners of war, after the Dutch\r\nsuccess at Majuba, was a matter of common report. It was well known if\r\nhe had not entertained them as guests of his own, they would have been\r\nconfined in the common gaol. Such kindness at such a time cannot be over\r\nestimated. Here the Boers had their headquarters during the war, the\r\nDutch flag having been hoisted at the beginning of the revolt, without\r\nresistance or bloodshed, on Durgaan’s Day, December 16th, 1880.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the Boers behaved very creditably to the townsfolk,\r\ntreating them well and paying for everything which they got from the\r\nstores. Round about they made laagers to defend the place, possession of\r\nwhich our troops from force of circumstances were unable to even attempt\r\nto gain.\r\n\r\nIt was still raining when we drove away, and just as darkness was\r\nclosing round we outspanned at a farm-house where we stayed the night.\r\nThe next afternoon we came to Standerton on the Vaal River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT\r\n\r\n  ERECTED BY THE BOERS TO THEIR COMRADES (TWO) FALLEN AT MAJUBA,\r\n    MICHAELSON’S, LAING’S\r\n  NEK, TRANSVAAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis village, with 300 regulars and 70 civilians, was invested by 700\r\nBoers on December 24th, 1880, and for two months and a half, until the\r\narmistice was proclaimed, it was able to act on the defensive only.\r\n\r\nCrossing the river, in a few hours we came to the residence and store of\r\nMr. Michaelson, where we stopped the night. These had been used as\r\nhospitals by the Boers, from January 28th, 1880, to the close of the\r\nwar. Here the road divides, one branch leading to Wakkerstroom, the\r\nother to Coldstream, and over Laing’s Nek into Natal.\r\n\r\nWithin forty yards of Mr. Michaelson’s house the Boers have erected a\r\nmonument to their dead who fell at Majuba; on this every death which\r\noccurred on that day, so fatal to our arms and prestige in South Africa,\r\nis distinctly recorded.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying picture is from a sketch which I made on passing. When\r\nlooking at this reminder of scenes gone by, I could not help thinking\r\nover our own dead, sleeping peacefully in the graveyard at Mount\r\nProspect, just across the border, a few short miles away.\r\n\r\nMrs. Michaelson and her husband were very kind, invited me into their\r\nprivate house, gave me a good dinner and bed; but I had not long to\r\nrest, as Mr. Michaelson awoke me before daylight in the morning, the\r\nmail cart starting very early. Passing Coldstream, the sun was just\r\nrising as we came near on our left hand to the site of the Boer camp\r\nduring the late war; and now, more vividly than on my former visit,\r\nseeing both sides of the situation, could I realize the fact that if the\r\nlate Sir G. Pomeroy Colley had taken any rocket apparatus, or Gatling\r\ngun, with him on his ascent of Majuba, or even ordered a diversion to be\r\nmade at Laing’s Nek, the Boer camp must have lain entirely at his mercy.\r\nThe day would have been his own, Gladstone’s fit of repentance\r\nunnecessary, and the English flag would yet be flying over the\r\nTransvaal.\r\n\r\nThe morning, beautiful and clear after the night’s rain, enabled me, as\r\nthe post-cart passed along the road winding at its base, distinctly to\r\nsee every outline of Majuba once more, towering 3,000 feet above. It is\r\none of the finest scenes in South Africa, and will well repay a visit,\r\nthe more so as within a radius of ten miles the student can read three\r\nlessons in the history of his own time.\r\n\r\nAway on our left we drove past the battlefield of Laing’s Nek, bid\r\nfarewell to the resting-place of poor Colley at Mount Prospect, took a\r\nlast look at the roadside inn, now alas! in ruins, where two and a half\r\nyears before I had passed such pleasant hours, until arriving at the\r\nIngogo drift, Vormstone gave me a splendid breakfast. An hour’s rest,\r\noff we went again, crossed the Ingogo and made the gradual ascent, which\r\nI have described before in another chapter, to the battlefield of\r\nSchuin’s Hooghte.\r\n\r\nHere I got the post-cart driver to stay for a quarter of an hour, while\r\nI paid a second visit to the graveyard close to the road. I found\r\neverything just the same as when I was last there immediately after the\r\nwar, except that close alongside a neat little monument had been erected\r\nin commemoration of those who fell on the field, and those who died,\r\nignominiously _deserted_ three short years before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT\r\n\r\n  ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN (BRITISH) AT SCHUIN’S HOOGHTE.\r\n    MAJUBA IN\r\n  THE DISTANCE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGalloping down from Schuin’s Hooghte, a few miles more brought us to\r\nNewcastle, and as the mail for Maritzburg did not start till next day, I\r\ngot a good rest. Everything in Newcastle had gone back. No signs of the\r\nlavish spending of Imperial money! No military camp with its reckless\r\nexpenditure now. The fine hotel, which on my former visit was crowded\r\nwith officers, contractors, sutlers and army hangers-on, had been burnt\r\ndown, and was in ruins. “The place thereof shall know it no more for\r\never.” My old friend, Greenlees, invited me to dinner, but I noticed\r\nthat he looked upon me with kindly pity, as one with whom cruel fortune\r\nhad made merry, and not as\r\n\r\n               “A man that fortune’s buffets and rewards\r\n               Had ta’en with equal thanks.”\r\n\r\nI left Newcastle early next morning, travelling over the same ground as\r\nI did years before, stayed at Ladysmith an hour or two, and tried to eat\r\na most infamously served lunch in, I think, the “inn’s worst room,” and\r\nstarted again for Colenso, where I rested the night. At early dawn we\r\nwere on the move. On we went, calling at Pinchin’s hotel at Estcourt,\r\nkept by a fellow passenger who came with me to Natal “two decades”\r\nbefore in the “_Tugela_” then away again past Howick and the beautiful\r\nfalls of the Umgeni, to Maritzburg.\r\n\r\nThe railway embankment in course of construction showed me the rapid\r\nstrides civilization was making, and was a proof that the iron horse\r\nwould soon neigh at a distance of 100 miles from the seaboard. In former\r\ndays I always went to the “Plough Hotel;” and, with a feeling I have of\r\nnever forsaking old friends or places, I went there again, but the hotel\r\nhad evidently been decorated (?) by contract for external show. The\r\nbackyard was covered in with glass, the floor paved with tawdry tiles,\r\nand a few stunted plants sprouted in despair from green painted pots.\r\nEverything for mere meretricious effect. The bugs, mosquitoes, dirt and\r\ndisorder of my bedroom were sufficient to drive me away to D’Urban next\r\nday. Before I went, however, I found opportunity to see a few friends\r\nwhom I had known years before. Among them Mr. Henrique Shepstone, who in\r\nmy Natal days was Coolie Immigration Agent, afterwards Judge Philip’s\r\nprivate secretary during the memorable trials in the Barbadoes, then\r\nSecretary of Native Affairs in the Transvaal during the Lanyon régime,\r\nand subsequently Imperial Government agent in charge of Cetywayo during\r\nhis visit to London, but now the Hon. H. Shepstone, Secretary of Native\r\nAffairs, having lately been promoted by Sir H. Bulwer to this post,\r\nwhich was formerly held by his father, Sir Theophilus Shepstone. Mr.\r\nPolkinghoene, the Treasurer General, whose beautiful coffee estate on\r\nthe banks of the Umhloti River I had often visited, was looking after\r\nthe finances of his adopted country, while my old partner in planting\r\nwhen I was on the coast had forsaken the cure of coffee, and taken to\r\nthe cure of souls!\r\n\r\nReclining in a luxurious railway carriage, I was able to look back on\r\npost-cart travelling and its miseries, thinking of Virgil’s “Forsitan\r\nhæc olim meminisse juvabit,” the present comfort making up for the\r\ndisagreeables of the past. Every comfort or pain in this world is by\r\ncomparison, and a first-class railway carriage seemed a very haven of\r\nrest after my 700 mile post-cart trip through Griqualand West, the\r\nTransvaal, and Natal. “Comparisons are odious,” but after the “Plough”\r\nat Maritzburg, the “Royal” at D’Urban, where I stayed, seemed a perfect\r\nparadise. I can scarcely tell how thoroughly I enjoyed my few days rest\r\nbefore the steamer “_Asiatic_” bore me to Capetown!\r\n\r\nThe Indian waiters robed in spotless white, the _recherché_ bills of\r\nfare, the noble dining-room with punkahs in constant play, the beds\r\nsupplied with mosquito curtains, the obliging landlord, the _tout\r\nensemble_ in fact, forced me, after an experience of nearly every large\r\nhotel in South Africa, to one conclusion, which was that the “Royal” at\r\nD’Urban was beyond any comparison _the_ hotel of the country.\r\n\r\nAfter a few days pleasant coasting, calling at East London, Port\r\nElizabeth and Mossel Bay, meeting friends at every place, we anchored at\r\nlast in Table Bay, but as the wind had suddenly commenced to blow great\r\nguns from the southeast, the Captain would not risk docking his steamer.\r\n\r\nExpecting to meet my wife, who had cabled she was coming out, after\r\nhearing of my accident, I risked going ashore in a small boat, getting\r\ndrenched through for my pains. “All’s well that ends well,” however, and\r\non landing I found that she had arrived safely the day before in the\r\n“_Athenian_” and was awaiting me.\r\n\r\nI was naturally very curious to learn what had caused her unaccountable\r\nanxiety, which I mentioned in my last chapter, as particular care had\r\nbeen taken to keep the fact of my accident from being cabled to her, and\r\nshe had remained in entire ignorance of my condition until letters\r\nreached her. She told me that she was sitting alone reading, much\r\ninterested in her book, when she felt a sharp thrill, like an electric\r\nshock, pass through her from head to foot. This distracted her attention\r\nfor a moment, but as she was about to resume her book, she heard a voice\r\ndistinctly say “Pray for Joe, _pray for Joe_.” This occurred on Sunday,\r\nDecember 2d, which was the day after my accident, and when in both\r\nKimberley and Du Toit’s Pan prayers had been offered in many churches\r\nfor my recovery.\r\n\r\nIn as far as I have read the accounts of such phenomena, this differs\r\nfrom them in some respects, and so I think may be interesting to members\r\nof the Psychical Research Society, and those engaged in investigating\r\nsuch mental phenomena or coincidences as clairvoyance, thought reading,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I ought to have taken a longer rest from work, I could not hear\r\ninactivity, and resumed the practice of my profession on February 14th,\r\n1884. This I continued as before until August, 1886, when, as I tell\r\nlater on, I visited the Kaap Gold Fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX.\r\n  VISIT TO THE KAAP GOLD FIELDS.—CAVES AT WONDERFONTEIN.—THE DUIVEL’S\r\n     KANTOOR—“THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH.”—BARBERTON AND ITS\r\n                DEVELOPMENT.—COURSE OF GOLD DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the course of the year 1886 certain events occurred which\r\ndetermined me upon visiting Europe, and possibly settling in America,\r\nbut before deciding upon the exact date of my departure, I resolved to\r\nvisit Barberton, the main town of the Kaap Valley Gold Fields, in the\r\nTransvaal, and learn for myself on the spot the truth or otherwise of\r\nthe statements then being made about the Fields, and which were exciting\r\nsuch intense interest in the Cape Colony and Natal, and even were\r\nbeginning to attract the attention of the European capitalists.\r\n\r\nI left Kimberley with that object in view in August last, by the mail\r\ncoach, which ran through as far as Marais’ Farm, a few hours beyond\r\nMiddleburgh, a small town seventy miles from Pretoria, the capital of\r\nthe state, and which may be remembered as a place of some importance\r\nduring Sir Garnet Wolseley’s operations in the Sekukuni war. I trusted,\r\nthough the mail-coach service ended there, that some favorable\r\nopportunity of getting on to Barberton, the chief mining town of the\r\ndistrict, might present itself. The gold fields that I was especially\r\ndesirous of visiting lie between the Godwaan plateau and the Makoujwa\r\nrange of mountains, along the valley of the Kaap and Crocodile Rivers,\r\nabout 240 miles east of Pretoria. The ground between Kimberley and\r\nPretoria I had travelled over three years before and consequently was\r\nwell acquainted with it. The country I found as naturally rich and as\r\npicturesque as on my former visit, but I could not detect any signs of\r\nprogressive energy or life. Everybody seemed imbued with the same\r\nlethargy and lack of industry and enterprise. On my arrival at Pretoria,\r\nhowever, I found the town, or rather the bars of the European Hotel and\r\nthe clubs, in a state of unnatural ferment, owing to the “boom”\r\noccasioned by the newly discovered gold deposit at Witwatersrand, a\r\nplace some thirty-five miles distant.\r\n\r\nThe gold there, I was told, had been found in a well-cased conglomerate,\r\nand the yield per ton was reported to be something fabulous. As a\r\nnatural result speculation of the wildest character was going on.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving at Potchefstroom, formerly the capital of the state, the\r\ncoach passed Wonderfontein, a farm where we changed horses, and which\r\nnow possesses a certain historical importance as being the main centre\r\nof the Boer deliberations during their late successful struggle for the\r\nindependence of their country.\r\n\r\nHere the driver of the coach was induced to wait an hour in order to\r\ngive the passengers the opportunity of visiting a renowned cave in the\r\nvicinity.\r\n\r\nA tedious drive all night had brought us at last, at ten o’clock in the\r\nmorning, to Wonderfontein. During the last hour or so, when the rising\r\nsun with profuse splendor “tipped the hills with gold,” the scenery,\r\nwhich had been rather monotonous since daybreak, became lighted up by\r\nglimpses of the beautiful Mooi River, which we could see running like a\r\nthread of glittering silver at the foot of a high range of hills to join\r\nthe Vaal River below Potchefstroom. Of a wonderful cave on this farm I\r\nhad often heard, and long wished to see. Mr. V. Aswegen, a son-in-law of\r\nthe late proprietor, very kindly consented to act as guide, and show us\r\nthe subterranean wonders which he told us he had discovered seven years\r\nago, when out hunting game, at the same time adding that the existence\r\nof the cave was but little known, not many visitors coming to the spot.\r\nOn our arrival at the place pointed out to us by the guide (four miles\r\nfrom his house), which was surrounded by trees, we scrambled down a few\r\nfeet into something like a pit twenty feet deep, and about thirty yards\r\nin diameter, having at one corner a little hole barely large enough to\r\nadmit a man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAVE AT WONDERFONTEIN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThrough this we groped one at a time. We did not advance far before the\r\npitchy darkness caused us to stop and light the candles and lamps with\r\nwhich each visitor had been provided. Then continuing our descent for\r\ntwenty minutes at least, as it were into the bowels of the earth, we\r\nwere suddenly ushered into a hall of dazzling whiteness, a scene of\r\nstartling fairy-like beauty presenting itself which words fail me to\r\ndescribe. Passing on a few yards we found ourselves in a large\r\namphitheatre, at least one hundred yards across, with a dome sixty feet\r\nin height, arching above. From this hung in profusion groups of\r\nglittering stalactites, like giant icicles, some being as much as thirty\r\nfeet in length, others shorter, and all the color of driven snow, which,\r\ncombined with the stalagmites growing as if out of the floor and in some\r\ncases meeting, produced an effect which was simply superb.\r\n\r\nStalactites are produced, I may state, by the percolation of water,\r\nholding some mineral matter in solution, through the rocky roofs of\r\ncaverns; the evaporation of the water producing a deposit of the mineral\r\nmatter, and gradually forming the long pendant cones. Large caves are\r\nfound only in limestone regions, and chemistry shows that water holding\r\nlime in solution does so by virtue of the carbonic acid it contains, and\r\nwill deposit the lime when the acid escapes.\r\n\r\nImagination here could revel at will, and play any freaks she chose. To\r\nthe fancy were suggested vivid and varied scenes, while associations of\r\nall kinds—recollections of the past, and anticipations of the\r\nfuture—crowded on the spectator’s mind. In one corner the stalactites\r\nextended nearly to the ground, in circular pillars, and to the eye of\r\nfancy seemed like the carved confessionals in some continental\r\ncathedral, and it needed no great stretch of imagination to expect\r\nmomentarily the appearance of the fair penitent and “holy friar.” A\r\nlittle further—still allowing fancy scope—there could be seen the pipes\r\nof a magnificent organ, extending to the dome, while, seemingly to prove\r\nthat all was real, our guide ran his fingers over these vibrating pipes,\r\nbringing out a succession of tones both musical and clear. Looking on\r\nthe other side of what I shall term this magnificent hall, the Roman\r\nForum, with its eloquent speakers, and the noble orations they delivered\r\nin centuries gone by, were brought vividly to one’s memory by the very\r\nmodel of an ancient rostrum, standing ready for another Cicero again to\r\nmount and passionately declaim “Quosque tandem abutere, Catilina,\r\npatientia nostra.”\r\n\r\nAt the request of my companions I mounted this natural platform, when\r\namid most enthusiastic plaudits from the friendly audience I spoke as\r\nfelicitously as I could on the Transvaal and its resources, and dwelt\r\nupon the probable time, the countless ages, which had been consumed in\r\nthe formation of the natural beauties we were viewing.\r\n\r\nBefore bidding farewell to this never-to-be-forgotten scene, we gathered\r\ntogether underneath the centre of the dome and sang “God save the\r\nQueen,” our guide, with the precision of a drummer, beating time on one\r\nof the pendant cones. I must not forget to mention that the echo which\r\nreverberated through this majestic hall reminded me most vividly of the\r\nTaj Mahal at Agra, and of the curious acoustic properties of that white\r\nmarble mausoleum. But the distant notes of our driver’s bugle summoning\r\nus, we were suddenly reminded that we must again tempt the fortunes of\r\n“a cold, cold world,” and leave these mysterious caverns to the darkness\r\nof midnight and the silence of the grave.\r\n\r\nAfter a day’s rest at Potchefstroom we went on to Pretoria (the seat of\r\ngovernment since November, 1865), where we stayed the night, and started\r\nnext morning for Marias’ Farm, sixty miles beyond Middleburg, where, as\r\nI have already told you. the mail service ceased. Here I and a fellow\r\npassenger were compelled to hire a special conveyance to take us on to\r\nthe Duivel’s Kantoor, passing through the romantic Eland’s Valley and by\r\nthe side of the Barret-Berlyn property. This village (the Kantoor),\r\nwhich is picturesquely situated at the very edge of the Drakensberg\r\noverlooking the Kaap Valley, was formerly the headquarters of the\r\ndiggers for alluvial gold on the Godwaan plateau, and also the residence\r\nof the gold commissioner. I will refer to one of my letters for a\r\ndescription of the scene: “A short distance from the hotel where I am\r\nresting I have just seen one of the finest sights that has fallen to my\r\nlot to behold since I have been in South Africa. It is only a stone’s\r\nthrow from the table where I am writing to the edge of the Drakensberg,\r\nbut before the grand scene which I shall essay to describe to you bursts\r\nupon the view, the pathway twists and winds through such immense\r\nwater-worn sandstone boulders, tossed as it were promiscuously around,\r\nand of every conceivable size and fantastic shape, that no wonder the\r\nilliterate and superstitious but God-fearing Boer imagined some\r\nsupernatural power—the Devil himself, in fact—when in a capricious mood\r\nhad taken a particular interest in the locality.\r\n\r\n“You have not forgotten, I am sure, our trip to the Falls of the Tugela\r\nin 1870, where, in one unbroken sheet, we saw that river leap over the\r\nDrakensberg 1,800 feet. I can even now picture to myself the view from\r\nthe top of the Berg, a spot where few save the prowling Bushmen, with\r\ntheir poisoned arrows, have ever been; and can well remember how I\r\nfeasted my eyes on the vast expanse below, studded with the homesteads\r\nof enterprising British colonists. I have been, as you know, on Majuba’s\r\nheights, and have seen the rocks up which General Smith and his plucky\r\nband resolutely climbed on that eventful Sunday morning, performing one\r\nof the most heroic feats of modern times—and I have lingered for hours\r\non Table Mountain, viewing the magnificent panorama of Capetown, with\r\nits docks and shipping, the picture framed on the one side by the green\r\nof its beautiful suburbs, and on the other by the blue of the mighty\r\nOcean. But these all pale before the view of the Kaap Valley from the\r\nDuivel’s Kantoor.\r\n\r\n“When I first reached the edge of the Berg, the Kaap Valley—2,000 feet\r\nbelow me, which I knew from report was some thirty miles in diameter and\r\nsurrounded by an amphitheatre of hills—presented a weird and beautiful\r\nappearance, being entirely covered by a dense white mist, which seemed\r\nlike some vast inland sea. At the same time the rising sun, topping the\r\nhills on the other side of the valley, added to the novelty of the scene\r\nby pouring its dissolving rays, through a clear and cloudless sky, on\r\nthe misty surface which glittered like a mirror as it reflected back the\r\ngolden sheen. By degrees, as the sun, rising higher in the heavens,\r\nbecame more powerful, the conical-shaped hills which dotted the valley\r\nbegan to pierce through the mist, and beautiful islands with their bays\r\nand inlets seemed traced as on a map before me. I could not leave the\r\nplace—I seemed rooted to the spot; but after turning round for a few\r\nseconds a still greater surprise was in store, for during the brief\r\nperiod that my attention had been withdrawn, a change, as if by magic,\r\nhad taken place. The ‘blanket’ or ‘table-cloth,’ as the mist is called,\r\nhad suddenly disappeared, and the whole valley was exposed to view;\r\nonly, however, hanging over the spruits and marking their courses, did\r\nit still remain.”\r\n\r\nTen or twelve years ago, I have been told, this valley was in many parts\r\na complete swamp; it was, notwithstanding this however, a favorite\r\nresort in the winter for the Boers from the neighboring high lands who\r\ncame to shoot the big game—the lions, tigers, buffaloes, and rhinoceri,\r\nwith which it abounded; but my medical knowledge soon told me the reason\r\nwhy the Boers had formerly named this romantic valley “The Valley of the\r\nShadow of Death,” for the stern reality forced itself upon me that the\r\npestiferous breath of the rolling mist, that I had just so much admired,\r\nalthough beautiful and fair to view, was dangerous in the extreme, and\r\nwould yet prove the “bed-rock” which full many an unlucky digger would\r\nbe sure to “strike.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BARBERTON, TRANSVAAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTo the northeast I had pointed out to me the conical-shaped Spitzkop,\r\nwhich, with the Devil’s Knuckles, Mauch Berg, 8,725 feet high, and\r\nMacdonald’s Berg, mark the Lydenberg Gold Fields, and straight across to\r\nthe south and southeast I could see Barberton, Moodie’s Lower Camp,\r\nPretorius Kop and the Tafelberg, while the Makoujwa range, which forms\r\nthe boundary between the Transvaal and Swaziland, formed the background\r\nto the scene. I am told there is an oil painting of this beautiful\r\nvalley in the South Kensington Museum, painted by a Dutch artist as long\r\nago as 1790. All the way on our road to Barberton, at which place it\r\ntook us at least eight hours to arrive, we found the valley through\r\nwhich we passed uninhabited; yet there were at almost every few yards,\r\nin the shape of piles of stones, heaped together for mealie-garden\r\nclearings, evidences that this valley had but one generation back been\r\nenormously populated. In the early part of the century Umselikatzi, the\r\nlate chief of the Matabeli—himself a Zulu, in fact a cousin of Chaka—was\r\nsent out of Zululand by Chaka, Cetywayo’s uncle, when he swept through\r\nSwaziland, and depopulated this valley, and, as one writer says, “they\r\nslew and slew until their arms were tired of killing,” then establishing\r\nhimself in Matabele Land, beyond the Limpopo, set himself up as an\r\nindependent monarch. This accounts very clearly for the fact that,\r\nalthough other tribes and languages intervene between the Zulu country\r\nand Matabele Land, yet nearly pure Zulu is even now spoken by the\r\nMatabeli.\r\n\r\nThe Kaap Valley after this became a species of “No Man’s Land,” and the\r\nhabitat simply of refugee Kafirs and broken-up tribes, who acknowledged\r\nthemselves subjects of the Swazi king and paid him tribute. The Swazis,\r\nhowever, from time to time, sent commanders further north, and made\r\nraids on Sekukuni’s Kafirs, or Bapedi, who, although they were once or\r\ntwice successful in repulsing the invaders, were at last conquered, when\r\nthe Swazis became paramount as far north as the Steelpoort River. This\r\nstrip of land extending from the Makoujwa range to the river\r\nabove-mentioned, including of course the Kaap Valley, was ceded to her\r\nMajesty’s government by the Swazi king; who, however, now declares that\r\nhe never gave it to the Boers, who obtained it from us on the\r\nretrocession, but to her Majesty.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Barberton, which is the rendezvous of all the\r\nprospectors in the neighborhood, I found it to consist of a mining town\r\nof about 2,000 inhabitants, nestling at the foot of the steep range of\r\nhills which serves to divide the Transvaal from Swaziland. This place,\r\nwhich but a few months before had been a village with but one or two\r\nhouses, before I left was the centre of a large and increasing\r\npopulation. Some idea may be formed when I tell you that the government\r\nhas allotted 3,000 building stands on which there are hotels, stores,\r\nchurches of different denominations, either completed or in course of\r\nerection, two stock exchanges, a club, a theatre, two music halls, three\r\nnewspaper offices, three banks, a market-house, as well as large\r\ngovernment buildings, comprising courts of law, post and telegraph\r\noffices, and last, but not least, that necessity of existence known in\r\nthis country as a “tronk,” but elsewhere a prison—in fact, if it were\r\nnot for the absence of the railway-engine and electric wire, none of the\r\nrequirements of civilization would be wanting.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the sudden rise of Barberton may be gained when a\r\ncomparison is made of its past and present postal requirements. In\r\nMarch, 1886, the revenue from the sale of postage stamps amounted only\r\nto £24, while more than £1,000 worth were sold in December of the same\r\nyear. During the same month the revenue from other sources amounted to\r\nover £16,000, and taking this as a fair monthly average at the present\r\ntime, the revenue from Barberton and the Kaap Gold Fields alone is\r\nconsiderably greater than that of the whole state some two or three\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nNaturally, among a population composed of men of various types and\r\nnationalities, a great diversity of character must be found,\r\nhard-working men, sober toilers, drunken sots, worthless loafers, men of\r\nstrict integrity, and others without a grain of honesty in their\r\ncomposition, are to be met with daily. Sad to say, a good many of those\r\nsent up to the Kaap Gold Fields to prospect, supported by syndicates in\r\nthe Colony or Natal, never searched for the precious metal save in the\r\nbilliard room, though as a change, now and then, they took an enjoyable\r\npicnic on the veldt at the expense of the confiding contributors to\r\ntheir outing.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter much to be regretted that strong drink, with its\r\naccompanying vices and crimes, and the diseases that its excess induces,\r\nespecially in hot countries, always follows the advent of the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. In and around this small community canteens and low\r\ngrog-shops absolutely swarm, the number of licensed houses in the\r\ndistrict being over 200—or one grog-shop for every ten of its\r\npopulation. The state places no limit on the issue of licenses, either\r\nwholesale or retail; at present, until Barberton be declared a township,\r\nwhen a retail liquor license will cost £50, the one can be obtained for\r\n£12, and the other for £15, per annum, and Sunday trade is not\r\nrestricted.\r\n\r\nBarberton and the surrounding locality, in my opinion, would be as\r\nhealthy and have as low a death-rate as any place in South Africa, the\r\nclimate being both pleasant and invigorating, if only the simplest\r\nsanitary precautions[110] were adopted by the authorities, and the\r\npopulation generally were fairly abstemious.\r\n\r\nI wish here to correct a most erroneous impression which seems to\r\nprevail through South Africa as to the danger of residence in Barberton\r\nduring the summer months. The climate of Barberton is but little, if at\r\nall, more unhealthy than that of Kimberley, and I speak advisedly from\r\nprofessional experience gained in both places. The only real exception\r\nthat can be taken against Barberton as compared with Kimberley is, that\r\nbeing some seven degrees nearer the equator, the heat is more intense,\r\nand consequently greater care has to be taken in avoiding its depressing\r\ninfluences than in the other locality named. Let me, therefore, beg of\r\nyou to disabuse your minds of the belief that Barberton in summer-time\r\nis a hot-bed of malaria. I must confess that I started to Barberton with\r\na certain amount of trepidation as to the possibility or probability of\r\nmyself or my healthiest neighbors being stricken down without warning by\r\nan attack of fever, the picturing of whose virulency had led me to\r\nexpect an active counterpart to the great plague of London. Other\r\npractitioners there have owned to similar preconceived notions, of\r\nwhich, like myself, they soon become disabused. As a matter of fact,\r\nnothing can be further from the truth. Malaria indisputably exists in\r\nthe low-lying districts situated to the north of Barberton; but a\r\nresidence in and about that district, when accompanied by reasonable\r\nprecautions, is as safe for a healthy man, woman or child, as almost\r\nanywhere in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal government, urged on no doubt by the exaggerated reports\r\nof the unhealthiness of the town, has generously given £2,000 to assist\r\nin building a general hospital. Pending the completion of this building\r\na neat little cottage hospital has been fitted up, a medical staff\r\nappointed, and, with two trained nurses from the Kimberley hospital, who\r\nhave volunteered their services, the sick poor are now fairly\r\ncomfortable. The reports circulated through South Africa concerning the\r\ninsalubrity of the Fields are fearfully exaggerated, but they have\r\nalready attracted a number of doctors, largely in excess of the\r\nrequirements of the place.\r\n\r\nIt is amusing to note the mistakes of current journalism. For instance,\r\nin the last Christmas annual issued by the _Natal Mercury_ appeared the\r\nfollowing remarkable piece of information: “The Kantoor is regarded as\r\nthe sanatorium of Barberton, and to it the inhabitants repair on the\r\nfirst symptoms of illness.” It is not necessary for me to tell you that\r\nthe Kantoor is thirty-five miles distant from Barberton, and I should\r\npity the poor patient who would have to “jog his bones over the stones”\r\nin order to seek renewed health in this so-called sanatorium.\r\n\r\nBut as far as the finding of gold is concerned, the wave of modern gold\r\ndiscovery in Southeast Africa has flowed in an entirely opposite\r\ndirection from the course it might have been expected to take,\r\ncommencing in the interior and proceeding by slow and measured steps in\r\nthe direction of the coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BARBERTON.—FIRST GAOL AND HOSPITAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI may here just remind you of the unsuccessful expedition sent out in\r\n1650 from Lisbon, under Francesco Barreto, to explore the gold fields of\r\nthese regions, and _en passant_ may mention that the yearly yield of\r\ngold exported at a somewhat later date by the Portuguese was more than a\r\nmillion pounds sterling in value, or, according to one authority,\r\n£3,000,000. Yet these matters I will not enter into fully now, but\r\nreview at once the result of the work done in recent years.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further I may recall a fact that many may have\r\nforgotten, _viz._: that the Transvaal Republic, under President\r\nPretorius, made it penal for any one (£500 fine) finding precious stones\r\nor metals on his farm to reveal such discovery to any one except the\r\ngovernment, and it was not until during the more liberal _régime_ of\r\nPresident Burgers that this absurd piece of senile legislation was\r\nrescinded or fell into abeyance.\r\n\r\nBut as I say, to come to modern times—Mr. H. Hartley, the celebrated\r\nelephant hunter and explorer, while shooting in the Matabele country in\r\n1866, was led to suspect the existence of gold in that country, and so\r\nexcited was he from what he saw, and also from the current stories\r\nafloat, that on the next trip which he took in the following year he\r\nbrought with him a young German traveller, the late Carl Mauch, to aid\r\nhim in discovering the truth or falsehood of these reports. Mauch wrote\r\nin the most glowing terms of what he saw, and of the wonderful richness\r\nof the quartz that he found, the result being that after the formation\r\nof various colonial companies Sir John Swinburne and Capt. Levert,\r\nrepresenting the London and Limpopo Mining Co., came out from England in\r\n1868, fully equipped, and proceeded to the Tati gold fields, of which\r\ndistrict Capt. Levert had got a grant from Umzelegatzi. These fields,\r\nextending from northwest to southeast, a distance of forty miles long by\r\nfourteen broad, are in 21° 27′ S. Lat., and 27° 40′ E. Long. There are\r\non the settlement itself, according to Alfred G. Lock, F.R.G.S., eleven\r\nmines (in fact nine different companies were formed) from which gold has\r\nbeen taken, and these are all situated, he says, on workings sixty to\r\nseventy feet deep, of the age of which some idea may be gathered from\r\nthe fact that trees from 150 to 200 years old are now growing within\r\nthese ancient shafts. The workings of the Tati gold fields were\r\ncontinued by Sir John Swinburne, and afterwards by August Griete, for\r\nabout three years, when they were abandoned. One Australian miner,\r\nhowever, remained behind, working on what was named the New Zealand\r\nReef, and his efforts were sufficiently successful to induce Mr. D.\r\nFrancis of Kimberley, to apply to Benguela, the Matabele king, for Sir\r\nJ. Swinburne’s concession, which he obtained, but up to the present time\r\noperations have been conducted without much success,\r\n\r\nThe discovery of other gold fields 350 miles to the northeast of the\r\nTati followed in a few weeks that of these fields. In October, 1868,\r\nMcNeil of D’Urban, with other members of the D’Urban Volunteer\r\nArtillery, of which corps he was then Lieutenant, left Natal, went first\r\nto the Tati, and then proceeded to what were termed the Northern gold\r\nfields, but on fever breaking out among the party, and several dying,\r\nthe survivors thought it more prudent to return.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, five years after Hartley’s discoveries, Mr. E. Button, a\r\nwell-known Natal colonist who in 1868 and 1869 had prospected the\r\ncountry northeast of Lydenburg, nearly as far as the water-shed of the\r\nZambezi, found gold upon his farm Eersteling, in the district of\r\nMarabastad, which was a new departure in gold discovery farther to the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nProceeding to England, he formed a company, The Transvaal Gold Mining\r\nCo., with a capital of £50,000, and returned to the Transvaal with a\r\nmining engineer of experience, and also with powerful machinery.\r\nAlthough troubled with many difficulties, but principally with water in\r\nhis main shaft, he worked away with varying success until the Boer war\r\nof 1881 put an entire stop to his efforts. The Boers, in their desperate\r\nneed at the time, made a complete wreck of his machinery, being\r\nconstrained, through want of ammunition, to cut up even the stamper-rods\r\nof the battery, to mould into cannon balls.\r\n\r\nThe next move in a southerly direction was the finding of gold by Mr.\r\nLachlan and others, in September, 1873, on the Blyde (or Joyful) River,\r\nat Pilgrims’ Rest, at Mac Mac; close by, and at Spitzkop, a solitary\r\nhill twenty miles distant. These alluvial diggings supported from 5 to\r\n800 diggers, and Pilgrims’ Rest became for a time a place of\r\nconsiderable importance, until the principal creek being nearly worked\r\nout, and many diggers in consequence leaving, the government virtually\r\ndrove the remainder away by granting a concession to a company formed by\r\nMr. David Benjamin. This concession gave power to the company to remove\r\nall diggers on payment of compensation, which was made to the amount of\r\n£55,000. It is a subject of regret, however, that the same want of\r\nsuccess has followed this company as that which has hitherto attended\r\nthe Lisbon and Berlyn, the company in connection with which the name of\r\nBaron Grant has so prominently figured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI.\r\n    COURSE OF GOLD DISCOVERIES CONTINUED.—MOODIE’S SYNDICATE.—THEIR\r\n    EXORBITANT DEMANDS AND THE RESULT.—BARBER BROS., AND THE UMVOTI\r\n           REEF.—MAD SPECULATIONS.—FUTURE OF THE GOLD FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to this, in 1881, a long lull had taken place in gold\r\ndiscoveries in the Transvaal, owing to various causes, and among others\r\nto the war.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of rumors of gold having been found at Eland Hoet being\r\nin circulation, a number of men, including prospectors, diggers, and\r\nothers, were attracted from Lydenburg and Pilgrims’ Rest to that\r\ndistrict, and notwithstanding the fact that this _swindle_, as it was\r\ntermed, was severely criticized in the public press, yet by this means\r\nthe discovery of the Kaap gold fields was incidentally brought about.\r\n\r\nMany of the diggers worked up the gullies, came on the Godwaan plateau,\r\nand ultimately the Kaapsche Hoop gold fields, still further south, with\r\nthe Duivel’s Kantoor as its centre, became an established fact. With\r\nrespect to the later gold discoveries in Swaziland I shall speak further\r\non. The Duivel’s Kantoor, Devil’s Counting House, at which I have\r\nmentioned we rested a night, is now comparatively deserted, containing\r\nbut half a dozen houses, and two canteens; but in June, 1882, before the\r\nTransvaal government, by granting a concession of most of the valuable\r\nmining land in the locality to a private company, drove the diggers\r\naway, this village was the prosperous business centre of at least 500\r\ndiggers, who were spread over the Godwaan plateau, an area of\r\ntwenty-eight by fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nAfter the concession, of which I have just spoken, was granted to the\r\nBarret-Berlyn Co., many of the diggers went down into the Kaap Valley\r\nand found alluvial gold at a spot afterwards named Jamestown, close to\r\nthe Kaap River, in Lat. 25° 31′ S. and Long. 31° 26′ E., about sixteen\r\nmiles from the present town of Barberton; and although nuggets up to 58\r\nozs. in weight were found by individual diggers, there still was no\r\ngeneral or substantial success.\r\n\r\nJamestown, however, may take the credit to itself of being, as it has\r\nbeen styled, “the cradle of the country which was in future to populate\r\nour reefing districts.”\r\n\r\nSome of the diggers becoming dissatisfied with their luck left the\r\nplace, went in a southwest direction, and struck some very rich gold\r\nreefs, together with some insignificant alluvial diggings, on certain of\r\nthe farms, thirteen in number, the property of Mr. G. P. Moodie, the\r\nSurveyor General of the Transvaal. The choice of the farms has since\r\nproved a very lucky stroke for Mr. Moodie, for although when he acquired\r\nthem from the government he might possibly have looked forward, in the\r\ndistant future, to a railway being constructed from Delagoa Bay to\r\nPretoria, which would enhance their value, yet at the time he became\r\ntheir owner no one ever dreamt of the possibility of their being\r\ngold-bearing. This gentleman had made in 1870 and 1871 three official\r\njourneys from Pretoria to the coast, with the object of discovering the\r\nbest line of road either for rail or wagon, and on his second journey he\r\npassed through this tract of country.\r\n\r\nI may mention, in passing, that, touching the geology of the district, a\r\nlate writer states that “the formation consists chiefly of argillaceous\r\nslates and schists, sandstones, and conglomerate, in some places\r\ndisturbed by granite and traversed by quartz-reefs and igneous dykes.\r\nThe reefs are for the most part vertical, and run almost due east and\r\nwest, with a southerly inclination.”\r\n\r\nBut to return to the history of these gold fields, discovered on Mr.\r\nMoodie’s farms: In November, 1882, certain terms on which diggers were\r\nallowed to peg out claims on these properties were posted up at the Gold\r\nCommissioner’s office at the Kantoor by Mr. Moodie’s attorneys, and as a\r\nconsequence many proceeded thither to prospect. Their reports being\r\nconsidered satisfactory, a general rush was made, for with the most\r\ncrude and primitive appliances it soon became generally known that a\r\ncomparatively large quantity of gold was being turned out. The number of\r\ndiggers increased rapidly, spread out into three camps, and everything\r\nwent on prosperously until towards the end of 1883, when Mr. Moodie\r\ndisposed of his property to a Natal syndicate for £240,000. Before doing\r\nthis he rescinded the terms which he had made with the diggers during\r\nthe previous year, and the consequence was that great dissatisfaction\r\nwas caused among them. The Natal directorate, evidently with the\r\nintention of squeezing out of the diggers all that they could get, and\r\nforgetting the possibility of killing the goose that lays the golden\r\neggs, immediately began to impose the most exorbitant taxes. They\r\ndemanded £3 a month license money per claim, and a royalty of from 7½ to\r\n4½ per cent. on all gold turned out. These changes, together with\r\npayments for wood, water, charcoal, grazing, and stand rents, soon was\r\nattended with the result that might have been foreseen—the diggers were\r\nled to prospect on the government farms adjoining, and situated to the\r\nnortheast, on which in 1885 a public gold field was proclaimed.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1884, Messrs. Barber Bros., gentlemen well known in the\r\nCape Colony, at the time joining business with pleasure, were shooting\r\ngame in the Kaap Valley. In the month of August, they came to a stream\r\nknown as the Umvoti Creek, about half a mile distant from the site of\r\nBarberton, a township which has since been named after them, when, on\r\nlooking up the side of the steep ravine bordering it, they detected a\r\nquartz reef jutting out, which on examination showed visible gold. This,\r\nwith the assistance of Mr. T. C. Rimer, who can well lay claim to be one\r\nof the pioneers of the Transvaal gold fields, they opened up, imported a\r\nten-stamp battery (the first on the Kaap fields) and began, as soon as\r\nit was erected, to crush at once. From the moment their returns became\r\nknown the death-knell of Moodie’s Co. was tolled, either as a paying\r\ninvestment, or as regards any further important increase in the\r\nprospecting or mining on their property, although the various\r\nsub-working companies, notwithstanding their being so heavily taxed, are\r\nin many instances doing fairly well. The diggers now made the rush to\r\nwhich I have above alluded, and left Moodie’s almost deserted, when the\r\nmountains and gorges, the rugged slopes and defiles along the Makoujwa\r\nrange, became peopled by prospectors, attracted from all parts of South\r\nAfrica, and many valuable properties were discovered; but it was not\r\nuntil “Bray’s Golden Quarry,” ten miles from Barberton, was found (May,\r\n1885), that the South African world became awakened to the fact of the\r\nrichness of the Transvaal as a gold-yielding country. This wonderful\r\nmine was, as the discoverer himself told me, accidentally found after\r\nfive months prospecting on the Sheba range by Mr. Edwin Bray, whom I\r\nknew in 1871 as a pioneer diamond digger, and whose name will now\r\nforever stand associated with the development of this auriferous region.\r\nAlthough the company which he formed did not at the time possess its own\r\nmachinery, and was for months compelled to send its quartz eight miles\r\naway over a rugged country to be crushed at an expense of at least one\r\noz. of gold per ton, pending the completion of a tramway to the Queen’s\r\nRiver, yet it paid back in fifteen months 63½ per cent. of its capital\r\nin dividends; its £1 shares sold readily at £75 or over, and the return\r\nof its crushing averaged 7 oz. 3 dwts. per ton; and this, although from\r\ntests applied it had been proved that the refuse-tailings contained 4\r\noz. of gold per ton, lost through imperfect manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the quarry at once raised endless speculations in my mind\r\nas to the vastness of its wealth. To form even a remote idea was an\r\nimpossibility. On the one hand I could look from the bottom of a deep,\r\nalmost precipitous, ravine, where the reef could be measured 100 feet in\r\nthickness, and see towering between 400 and 500 feet above me the\r\ncapping of the quartzite reef, lying at an angle of fifty degrees on the\r\nedge of the quarry proper, while on the other no limit to the extent of\r\nthe reef hidden from view beneath my feet had yet been determined;\r\nneither had the length of the vein, although almost certain indications\r\nhad been found that it extends nearly half a mile. I began to calculate\r\nwhat the return of this company will be with the 100 stamps about to be\r\nerected at daily work, until dreams of untold wealth came over me, from\r\nwhich I awoke to warmly congratulate my old friend on his marvellous\r\nsuccess, which as one of the most active mineral prospectors in the\r\nTransvaal he so richly deserves. On my visit to Mr. Bray’s I noticed\r\nthat the road to Sheba is dotted with canteens. Although the distance is\r\nonly twelve miles, yet the inner man can be supported six or seven times\r\nbefore arrival at Eureka City, (within a stone’s throw of the Sheba\r\nReef), and when there almost as many canteens as houses may be counted.\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the great amount of prospecting work which has\r\nbeen done, very few really payable gold reefs have been as yet struck.\r\nSpeaking of prospectors’ work, I may state that on the day I left I\r\ncounted in the Gold Co.’s office 513 registered blocks of amalgamated\r\nclaims; but of these more anon. There can be no doubt that the precious\r\nmetal exists in various degrees of richness in the quartz-veins that are\r\nto be seen all around the Kaap Valley, yet these have not been\r\ndiscovered in quantity rich enough to warrant the great influx of\r\ndiggers and men of almost every trade or profession, or the absurd\r\nspeculation in claims and shares which has taken place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHEBA REEF, BRAY’S GOLDEN QUARRY, BARBERTON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe public have been warned over and over again that these are no “poor\r\nman’s diggings,” but at a distance the very name of _gold_ serves to\r\ncall up the most enchanting visions, and forbids the difference between\r\nalluvial diggings and quartz mining being sufficiently weighed. There is\r\nsuch a thing in this world as living on a name; many a “worthless son of\r\na worthy sire” has found out this secret, and the name of Edwin Bray and\r\nthe stupendous wealth of his quarry has tended to enable company on\r\ncompany to be floated which never will pay a dividend between this and\r\nthe day of their liquidation. To Natal men the credit is certainly due\r\nof first developing the fields. The object which they had in view in\r\nforming companies was to found dividend paying concerns, with small\r\ncapitals only sufficiently large to provide adequate machinery to\r\ndevelop the property; whereas some, though of course not all, of the\r\nother speculators, who came in at a later period, formed large\r\ncompanies, took in any number of claims, whether proved gold-bearing or\r\nnot, so long as they would swell, with an appearance of justification,\r\nthe enormous capital of their prospectuses, got thousands of pounds\r\npromotion money, and, by means of a nicely managed ring, ran up the\r\nshares to a premium and then sold out.\r\n\r\nAs time goes on I feel certain that many things will have to be\r\nrectified, none more so than the pegging out of claims by\r\npower-of-attorney. If this absurd system be continued, there is nothing\r\nto prevent the four hundred millions who inhabit the Celestial empire,\r\nor even the Man in the Moon and his family—could communication be\r\nestablished with Earth’s satellite—holding claims to the direct\r\ndetriment of those whose energy, determination, and self-sacrifice have\r\nprompted them to seek their fortunes in this new El Dorado.\r\n\r\nThe Transvaal, however, will in a very short time create further\r\nsensations. On the Sheba Hill veins of antimony (stibnite), worth in the\r\ncommercial world £33 per ton, have been found; and at the Komati,\r\nbaryta, used for bleaching and for the adulteration of white lead, has\r\nbeen discovered; while in the other parts of the district horn-silver,\r\nor chloride of silver, possessing 78 per cent. of the real metal, has\r\nbeen unearthed. This is not the same as Mackay’s celebrated mine in\r\nAmerica, the Comstock, which is argentite, sulphite of silver, commonly\r\ntermed black silver, containing as much as 85 per cent. of silver,\r\nthough it is, as will be seen, immensely valuable. Then again, both the\r\nblue and green carbonates of copper, as well as native copper, can be\r\nfound in abundance, and the wonderful Albert Mine, with similar ones,\r\nsituated near Pretoria, of fahlerz tetrahedrite, or grey copper ore,\r\nrunning from 113 to 200 ozs. of silver to the ton, must not be\r\nforgotten. Again, large coal deposits have been found at Ermelo and\r\nBronkhorst Spruit and also at Wynoor’s Poort, about 100 miles from\r\nBarberton, the last named being very little inferior to Welsh coal.\r\nColonel Warren,[111] formerly on Major-General George H. Thomas’s staff\r\nin the army of Tennessee, a practical geologist, also informed me he had\r\ndiscovered in the Transvaal, on his road up to the Barberton gold\r\nfields, petroleum shale which, he said, was almost a positive proof of\r\nthe existence of petroleum, in what may prove to be highly payable\r\nquantities. These coal deposits will be of immense value when the\r\ndifferent water-rights in the Kaap Valley are all taken up, as the\r\nnecessary wood for feeding any large number of steam engines is not to\r\nbe procured without great difficulty and serious expense.[112]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the madness of the speculation that has lately existed may\r\nbe formed, if it be taken into consideration that the inflated selling\r\nprice of the scrip of different companies floated merely, not worked,\r\nexceeded £5,000,000, while their subscribed value is under £2,000,000.\r\nThis has produced what I may term an abnormal and unnatural state of\r\nthings, not only at De Kaap, but in various other parts of South Africa.\r\nIt is important to bear in mind (January, 1887) that there are at\r\npresent only ninety-seven stamps at work (I include those on Moodie’s),\r\nyielding a profit of about £160,000 a year; and investors and\r\nspeculators will do well to remember that it will be at least eighteen\r\nmonths before an appreciable difference in their number can be made. If\r\nwe as business men compare this return with the outlay of money which is\r\ntaking place, we can at once see the ruinous scale on which business is\r\nconducted. As I told you, there are 513 amalgamated blocks in the\r\nproclaimed government gold fields, paying each, on an average, £10 a\r\nmonth duty to government; this is £61,560 a year. Then must be added the\r\ncost of working; put this at a very low estimate, say £20 per block,\r\nthere is £123,120 more. I will not reckon the expenditure of those\r\nprospectors who have not pegged out, but take next the share list of\r\ncompanies floated. These amount to say roughly £1,800,000, but their\r\ninflated value is at least £5,000,000. Now surely these investors expect\r\nsome interest on their capital, and if a modest 5 per cent. only be\r\nallowed, although all mining speculations ought to return at least 20\r\nper cent, (and you will agree with me, the greater part of this capital\r\nwill pay no interest for two years), we have a further loss of £250,000\r\na year to the investing public, or a total of £434,680 at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI saw the mania which occurred some years ago on the Diamond Fields, but\r\nthere, even, nothing so outrageously absurd and preposterous happened as\r\nin this gold share mania. I remember the time when central shares in the\r\nKimberley Mine, which in the height of the mania barely reached 300 per\r\ncent, rise, and were, moreover, at the very time paying over 50 per\r\ncent. interest on their subscribed value, falling on the collapse\r\noccurring from £400 to £26 per share, and, although the property is one\r\nof the richest in the world, yet it has taken years for it to regain its\r\nstatus. How then about gold shares running up from £1 to £25 per share,\r\nor 2,500 per cent. advance, which are not working, have no machinery,\r\nand cannot pay a dividend, if not for years, at least for months.\r\n\r\nThe great question is, What is to be the future of these fields? I must\r\nsay that, after careful investigation, I am not sanguine as to the Kaap\r\nValley being able to carry any large population for a long time to come,\r\nand even then the population will be purely a working one, men toiling\r\nfor regular wages, miners, engineers, and skilled artisans employed by\r\ncompanies. The average English laborer will be driven out of the fields\r\nby native labor, 1,500 natives being at present employed, and there will\r\nbe no such thing as a poor man jumping into a fortune except by some\r\nextraordinary stroke of luck. I cannot too strongly impress on those who\r\nare without capital, that Barberton is no place for them, that is,\r\nunless they are prepared to be contented with wages no better,\r\nproportionately, than they can earn in any other part of the world. The\r\nskilled artisan or experienced miner may be fortunate enough to obtain a\r\nsuccession of highly profitable engagements, but that is very far from\r\nbeing a certainty. Although I would not altogether wish to discourage\r\nthose who are willing “to scorn delights and live laborious days,” and\r\nwho possess certain special qualifications in technical knowledge, from\r\nvisiting Barberton, even although their store of money almost reaches\r\nthe vanishing point, yet I would bid the vast majority of those without\r\ncapital to pause and ask themselves whether it is not better to “bear\r\nthose ills” they “have, than fly to others that” they “know not of.”\r\nWere this an alluvial gold field my advice would no doubt be different.\r\n\r\nA man who, fifteen years ago, would have found the dry diamond diggings\r\na possible Golconda, would now, I will not for a moment say starve, if\r\nhe be sober, honest and industrious, but will have long to wait before\r\nhe comes within measurable distance of the realization of his hopes, if\r\nhe should ever do so. At Kimberley the day of the individual digger,\r\nunless he should be a man of enormous capital, is past and gone. There\r\nis a curious analogy between the two places; that which the increased\r\nexpense of working, together with the amalgamation of claims, has done\r\nfor the former, the working out of the known alluvial fields has done\r\nfor the latter. In fact, I am reluctantly compelled to admit, that I\r\nknow of no poor man’s diggings of any sort in South Africa.\r\n\r\nThat some good and extremely profitable reefs have been found, I do not\r\nfor one moment wish to deny, but as I have just now said, these can be\r\ncounted on the fingers of one hand. That gold is here and in large\r\nquantities is true, but it requires gold to get it, and there is such a\r\nthing as paying a guinea for a sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe place is now mainly, if not entirely, subsisting on imported\r\ncapital, and that intangible entity known as hope. For capitalists, who\r\nare choosing to risk their money in testing the value of the reef\r\nproperties, this is all very well. What I want to do, is to caution\r\nagainst disappointment those who think they are on the high road to\r\nfortune, when with hammer, pick, and tent they start off prospecting.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the subject of the gold fields I will only say that I am\r\nafraid that great disappointment must be the lot of the many—I mean the\r\nmany who seek the fields comparatively penniless, trusting to receive\r\nsome sudden, unearned favor from the blind goddess, rather than\r\ndetermining to force a smile from her by earnest, honest toil.[113]\r\n\r\nDuring my four months’ stay on these fields I pursued my profession and\r\nhad many opportunities of seeing the country, being called on\r\nprofessional work in almost every direction, from Eureka City and the\r\nSheba range to Moodie’s, and from the Kantoor to the Kami Klubane Beacon\r\nin Swaziland. And I also assisted in carrying out the hospital work,\r\nwhich was organized on a new footing while the larger government\r\nhospital was being built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n      LEAVE BARBERTON.—STEYNSDORP.—KOMATI RIVER.—KING UMBANDINI’S\r\n KRAAL.—SWAZILAND.—THE DRINK CURSE AND ITS INEVITABLE RESULT.—INTERVIEW\r\n     OF DR. CLARK, M. P., TRANSVAAL CONSUL-GENERAL IN ENGLAND, WITH\r\n     UMBANDINI.—NATIONAL DANCE OF SWAZIES.—THE TEMBI.—DELAGOA BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Year’s day, 1887, found me for the first time for twenty-two years\r\ndevoid of all care, whether business or professional, and imbued with\r\none thought only, that of getting a thorough rest and change in Europe.\r\nWishing before leaving the country to gain as intimate a knowledge as\r\npossible of the different railway routes to the coast, of which I had\r\nnow seen all but one, I made up my mind to walk to Delagoa Bay, through\r\nSwaziland, see Steynsdorp, the headquarters of the Komati diggers,\r\nglance in passing at the formation of the country and the gold reefs,\r\nwhich Umbandini, the Swazi king, was so liberally giving away in\r\nconcessions, and witness, if possible, the yearly dance of the Swazis,\r\nwhich is a red-letter day throughout the whole of their country. I chose\r\neight natives to accompany me, mixing their nationality so as to avoid\r\nthe chance of any collision on their part. I was especially fortunate in\r\nmy _induna_ (head man and guide), who was a tall, fine, strapping Swazi\r\nand knew every inch of the country from Barberton to Delagoa Bay, both\r\nmain roads and bye-paths. Many tried to dissuade me from going, telling\r\nme that the journey, which round by the King’s kraal was about 200\r\nmiles, was too long and fatiguing, and that I should not find sufficient\r\ncompensation for the risk of fever. But in answer to inquiries I made, I\r\nlearned that there was no danger of fever except between the top of the\r\nLebombo ridge and Delagoa Bay, and as the proprietor of the tug on the\r\nTembi had proffered to carry me from the drift where the tug lay to\r\nDelagoa Bay, a distance of sixty miles by the river, I calculated that I\r\nshould be exposed one day only to malarial poison. How I was\r\ndisappointed in this promise I will tell in the next chapter. I allowed\r\nmy natives to divide my luggage and provisions as they deemed best, one\r\nlong headed fellow to my astonishment choosing the heaviest burden,\r\nsaying, _with a knowing look as he did so_, “It is food, it will grow\r\nlighter every day.”\r\n\r\nAll being ready, we formed in procession (natives never walking in any\r\nway together except in single file), I myself bringing up the rear to\r\nprevent any of them lagging behind; and so we started from the Market\r\nSquare, Barberton, at eight o’clock, A. M., on Monday, January 10th. Our\r\nroad lay over the Makoujwa range, which we crossed a few miles from\r\nBarberton, at the Ivy Reef, feeling, when we had made this steep climb\r\nof 1,600 feet, that we had surmounted the first obstacle in our journey.\r\nWe walked along all day, with short intervals of rest, traversing a bold\r\nand magnificently mountainous country, interspersed with stretches of\r\nfine forest, and watered by innumerable streams, which roll down through\r\nthe large, deep dongas. I had hoped to reach the roadside accommodation\r\nhouse at the Komati River on my first night, but darkness coming on, we\r\nstayed at a Kafir kraal six miles on this side, and rising early got\r\nthere to breakfast. Here the Komati, fifty yards wide, runs rapidly down\r\nits sloping bed, but with a wire rope thrown over to guide the wooden\r\npontoon the passage across can nearly always be made. After crossing\r\nthis river, we passed the ruins of hundreds of deserted stone kraals\r\nwhich extended for miles, and were the standing witnesses of the teeming\r\npopulation which years ago inhabited these valleys, before Umzilikatze\r\nmade his murderous raids through Swaziland. Pushing on, we arrived at\r\nSteynsdorp in the mid-day. This little village, which is the centre of a\r\npopulation of 500 souls, lay at the end of a long valley through which\r\nthe Umhbondisi Creek runs, and was increasing so rapidly that, at the\r\ntime I passed, a government surveyor was busy laying out a township.\r\nDotting the hills all round could be seen the tents of prospectors, some\r\nof whom had discovered valuable properties—in fact this district, where\r\ngold had been more or less sought for during the past eighteen months,\r\nwas then just beginning to answer the expectations of its pioneers.\r\nAfter leaving Steynsdorp the country assumed a wilder aspect. The narrow\r\nand rugged paths, up and down which I had to clamber, in many places on\r\nthe verge of precipitous krantzes, ran over the most picturesque country\r\nI had yet seen in South Africa, while the loud splash and hurrying dash\r\nof the mountain stream\r\n\r\n            “As some bright river, that, from fall to fall,\r\n            In many a maze descending,”\r\n\r\nrushed down the hillsides, and debouched through the gorges, chanting\r\nincessantly one of Nature’s most melodious of lays. Suddenly a large\r\ntract of open country appeared to our view, and in front, but at least\r\ntwenty miles away, we could see the large kraal to which we were bound.\r\nJourneying on with refreshed vigor we finished our seven hours’ weary\r\nwalk about an hour or so before the sun went down, which left me time\r\nenough to become master of the whole situation. A most able and correct\r\naccount of Swaziland, and the state of affairs then existing, lately\r\nappeared in one of the London papers, which I cannot do better than\r\nquote here:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  KAFIR HUT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “Swaziland is a small native state bounded on the north and west by\r\n  the Transvaal; from its eastern border to the sea stretches the\r\n  Portuguese territory of Delagoa Bay, and to the south lie the land of\r\n  the Zulus and the colony of Natal. The Swazi King rules over a realm\r\n  of about 9,000 square miles, containing a population of 50,000. His\r\n  people are of the same Zulu race whose prowess has been proved on more\r\n  than one ‘well foughten field,’ but of finer physique, and 15,000\r\n  warriors are at his beck and call. The country itself is mountainous\r\n  and picturesque—a sort of East African Tyrol, with a genial climate, a\r\n  fertile soil, and rich in undeveloped mineral treasures—gold, silver,\r\n  copper, and coal. The coal measures extend over a large area, are\r\n  found within forty miles of Delagoa Bay, and are connected with the\r\n  sea by the Tembi, which, though not a large river, is navigable for\r\n  small craft and might be utilized for an extensive trade in black\r\n  diamonds. Swaziland is, moreover, well wooded and well watered, and\r\n  altogether a most desirable possession, a fact of which Umbandini, its\r\n  King, an intelligent savage of dark complexion and stalwart\r\n  proportions, is fully aware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FALLS BETWEEN BARBERTON AND THE KING’S KRAAL, SWAZILAND.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  “So also are the Boers. They call it the land of Goshen, and covet it\r\n  as eagerly as Ahab coveted the vineyard of Naboth. The Transvaal\r\n  Government make pressing overtures to Umbandini to place himself under\r\n  their protection, which would mean, of course, the practical surrender\r\n  of his kingdom, while individual Boers are flocking uninvited into the\r\n  country and gradually hemming it in on every side. But the King has a\r\n  wholesome dread of the tender mercies of the Boers, and, fortunately\r\n  for him, the London Convention of 1884 laid down the boundary line on\r\n  the Transvaal side with such precision that little room is left for\r\n  misunderstanding or dispute. Here, at least, the Boer Republic can\r\n  allege no ostensibly fair or valid excuse for removing their\r\n  neighbors’ landmarks. But the Boer trekkers, in dealings with the\r\n  natives, are not much concerned to observe the law of _meum_ and\r\n  _tuum_; and in April, 1885, Sir Henry Bulwer wrote to Sir Hercules\r\n  Robinson that he had received information to the effect ‘that the\r\n  Boers are making great encroachments in Swaziland; that they appear to\r\n  look upon the country as a winter grazing farm, and that they have\r\n  gone so far as to beacon off some farms notwithstanding the protest of\r\n  the Swazi king.’ On this, to put matters as briefly as possible, Sir\r\n  Hercules Robinson requested the Transvaal government ‘to use every\r\n  effort to prevent encroachments on the border,’ a move to which Mr.\r\n  Joubert responded by denying the fact on the one hand, and on the\r\n  other proposing to Umbandini to place himself and his country under\r\n  Transvaal protection with Mr. Kiogh, Landdrost of Wakkerstroom, as\r\n  nominal head and medium. This proposal the King and his _indunas_\r\n  rejected. They preferred to place themselves under British protection,\r\n  and to this effect a formal demand was forthwith made, accompanied by\r\n  a request for the appointment of a British Resident, whose duty it\r\n  would be to act as Umbandini’s adviser in all outside matters and give\r\n  timely notice of Boer encroachments at headquarters.\r\n\r\n  “To this request no answer has yet been returned. It is understood,\r\n  however, that Lords Granville and Rosebery had the subject under\r\n  consideration at the time of their retirement from office, and it will\r\n  be for Lord Salisbury’s government to give it their most serious\r\n  attention, and decide whether the Boers shall or shall not be required\r\n  to observe the terms of a convention which they deliberately accepted.\r\n  The question is not of conquering or annexing Swaziland, or even of\r\n  preventing the extinction of an interesting nationality, but of\r\n  safeguarding British interests by compelling the Transvaal Republic to\r\n  respect the integrity of a state whose independence we have virtually\r\n  guaranteed. To effect this object nothing more is needed than the\r\n  appointment of a Resident; for much as the Boers covet the land of\r\n  Goshen, they have not the least idea of going to war with England and\r\n  Umbandini to obtain it. Their policy is to cajole and coerce the king\r\n  into accepting a formal protocol; and then gradually swallowing his\r\n  kingdom as the anaconda swallows its prey. This consummation, besides\r\n  being a severe diplomatic and moral defeat, would be fatal to the\r\n  prosperity of Natal, and most detrimental to our commercial interests\r\n  in that part of the world. It could hardly fail, moreover, to lead to\r\n  serious complications. Gold seekers are already flocking in crowds to\r\n  the ‘placers’ of the Transvaal; the time is not far distant when there\r\n  will be a rush to the still richer fields of Swaziland. Most of the\r\n  adventurers are English and American, and men of English blood have\r\n  never yet submitted to the domination of an alien power. If their\r\n  government should refuse to protect them they will protect themselves,\r\n  possibly set up a government of their own, when difficulties might\r\n  arise which it is not pleasant to contemplate. Prevention is better\r\n  than cure, and it is significant of what is likely to befall, unless\r\n  prompt action be taken, that in September, 1885, Sir Henry Bulwer\r\n  transmitted a report ‘that the Boers had so overrun the Swazi country\r\n  that they had only left the district immediately occupied by the\r\n  king.’ A little later Colonel Cardew forwarded a communication to the\r\n  effect that 200 Boers were occupying the Bomba range of mountains ‘on\r\n  the strength of rights reputed to be acquired from the Portuguese,’\r\n  and according to recent advices, another body are trekking in the\r\n  Lebombo range, close to the Swazi border.”\r\n\r\nBut to return to my own story: The kraal was in a state of complete\r\nconfusion; the dance which was to take place on the next day seemed to\r\nhave upset every thing and every body. The men and women were in a state\r\nof nervous excitement from beer and expectation; the young girls,\r\nlighthearted and merry, were laughing, darting hither and thither,\r\ncoquetting with the young men, while the boys, sedately looking on with\r\ncalm content, were enjoying the scene. Alas! this innocent pleasure was\r\nnot all I saw. A few yards distant on the outside of the kraal, a crowd\r\nattracted my attention; there I found a tent which served as a canteen,\r\nand was surrounded with Swazis of both sexes, all of whom were buying\r\nspirits, chiefly gin, from the barman, or begging it from the few white\r\nmen present. I particularly noticed one woman, not exactly besotted, but\r\nwith an air of debauched voluptuousness in the sensual roll of her\r\nglaring eyes, suing importunately for drink, crying out again and again\r\nthe only English word she knew “Canteen, Canteen,” being the one which\r\nfrom experience she had learned would be understood, and bring her the\r\nall-devouring firewater.\r\n\r\nClose by, evidently a general favorite, and to whom considerable\r\ndeference was shown by the natives, could be seen, edging his way into\r\nthe tent, a bright little boy, who, I was told, was the king’s son.\r\nAlthough but a child not more than six years old, he too had learned to\r\ncrave for this fluid perdition, and there he stood clamoring and\r\nentreating to be served, until a white man gave him fully half a pint of\r\npure spirits, when immediately, without any ado, he swallowed it at one\r\ndraught, slowly strutting away as if he had performed some feat of which\r\nhe might well be proud. I did not remain long, soon seeing enough of\r\nthis melancholy exhibition of growing depravity and demoralization to\r\nconvince me that drink was eating into the vitals of the people and\r\ndestroying the manhood of a fine race, and that nothing stood between\r\nthem and utter ruin but the appointment of a British Resident,[114] of\r\nsimilar tact and determination to Colonel Clark, who has saved the\r\nBasuto nation from extermination by the same curse. I was very tired,\r\nand the sun sinking fast, suffusing the whole sky with lines of a ruddy,\r\ngolden tint, made me tell my boys to prepare for the night’s rest.\r\nBefore lying down to sleep, however, I strolled again round this immense\r\nkraal in order to form a more correct idea of its size, the number of\r\nits huts and the strength of its population. In the centre there was an\r\nimmense cattle kraal, which I conjectured was not less than ten acres in\r\nextent, the huts, at least 600 in number, being placed in a circle\r\naround, according to Kafir custom.\r\n\r\nHere preparations for the approaching yearly celebration and dance were\r\nbeing made, this festival being a “thanksgiving to the ground for once\r\nagain giving its return.” Every one seemed happy and gay, and all I met\r\nwere wound up to a high pitch of good-natured excitement, singing as\r\nthey danced along, evidently looking forward to the morrow, to the\r\nall-important day when the fête would commence.\r\n\r\nMy “boys” had in the meantime made me some coffee, prepared my evening\r\nmeal and laid out my karosses on the grass in readiness for the night’s\r\nslumbers. Sleep needed no wooing. When I awoke in the morning the sun\r\nwas shining brightly overhead. “Umhlatuse,” my _induna_ (head man), had\r\ngot my coffee ready, troops of Swazi girls, lithe and handsome, could be\r\nseen racing back from the river where they had been to bathe, the whole\r\nkraal was astir, even the canteen was open, and some devout worshippers\r\nof Bacchus were already paying homage at his shrine. Presently, afar in\r\nthe distance, could faintly be traced the dark outline of a moving mass\r\nof sable warriors, coming to make obeisance to their king and add to the\r\nday’s festivities. As the hours passed by, the large cattle kraal I have\r\nmentioned became the rendezvous of thousands of men of superb physique,\r\ndressed in gorgeous array, their shoulders resplendent with black and\r\nsnow-white ostrich feathers, their waists girded with leopard skins,\r\ntheir necks encircled with cow tails, sakabula feathers (a species of\r\nfinch) in circular bands around their heads, while handsome shields and\r\nassegais completed their festive attire. The married women, too, and\r\ngirls vied with each other in the richness of their costumes, which\r\naccording to their custom did not require to be so exact as to hide\r\nentirely the profusion of charms with which nature had endowed them.\r\nAbout mid-day, when the king, an intelligent but sensual middle-sized,\r\nand to appearance, middle-aged man, his light-copper-colored body,\r\nhowever, enveloped in rolls of fat, appeared with his retinue (having\r\nfirst bathed himself in sea water specially brought up for the occasion\r\nfrom the mouth of the “Usutii”), the commemoration began in earnest, for\r\nthen with measured step and dignified air the thousands of men and women\r\ncommenced dancing, advancing and retreating in perfect rythm, keeping\r\ntime to a rich, deep, warlike song they were chanting in beautiful\r\ncadence. There were three regiments present that morning numbering at\r\nleast 9,000 men, and with 3,000 women, as I have described, the scene\r\nwas both sensual and sensuous.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the kraal, and built of green branches cut from\r\nneighboring trees, was a long enclosure, the interior of which was kept\r\nhidden from vulgar gaze, no one being allowed to enter. A trader, who\r\nwas well known as being a confidant of the king, passing by at the time,\r\ngained me admittance for a moment, when a sight most unique presented\r\nitself. Kneeling and squatting on the grass were at least 150 boys\r\neagerly tearing and devouring the flesh of an ox which had been pummeled\r\nto death the previous day. This operation is an old custom, and on this\r\noccasion, I was told, it took about forty young men, unarmed (not even\r\nwith clubs), but merely striking the ox with their bare fists, fully an\r\nhour to accomplish. We had only a second of time allowed us by the guard\r\nat the entrance to peep in, as he was afraid some condign punishment for\r\nhis temerity, in permitting such a contravention of all precedent as\r\nallowing us to enter, would befall him if he were discovered. Much to my\r\nregret I could not find any one who could explain the meaning of this\r\nrite. Retiring at once we spent several hours in walking around and\r\nmixing with the natives, my impromptu guide drawing my attention to the\r\nstrong dialectic difference in the language as spoken by the Swazis and\r\nthe pure Zulu, they being a branch of the Zulu nation, who settled in\r\nthis region when Zenzamgakona was king, and he also kindly pointed out\r\nto me many men of importance. Among these I may mention Umbovane, the\r\nSwazi general who commanded the native levies which joined the forces\r\nunder Sir Garnet Wolseley in the attack on Sekukuni, and Zuhlane, a man\r\nof commanding presence, who had been prime minister during two reigns\r\nand whose word is law. Although an old man, gray, wrinkled, blear-eyed\r\nand with an appearance of dissipation, yet he has well sustained a\r\nreputation among the Swazis for diplomatic tact and foresight. Umbovane\r\nhas not even yet forgotten the greatness he had had “thrust upon him”\r\nseven years before, when Sir Garnet Wolseley invited him to dinner,\r\nafter the successful attack in which he had assisted the 94th and 80th\r\nRegiments in the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nThe most engrossing subject of conversation even at this time, although\r\ntwo months had elapsed, was the visit of Dr. Clark, the Consul General\r\nin London for the Transvaal, and the interview he had had with the king\r\non November 7th, 1886. This gentleman, as a member of the House of\r\nCommons and an Englishman, seems to have acted in the most extraordinary\r\nway—if Mr. Kannemeyer, an influential miner whom I knew well, and who\r\nwas present at this interview, can have understood correctly. Dr. Clark,\r\naccording to this gentleman’s description, seems all through to have\r\nacted as a paid agent of the Boers would have acted, and his disparaging\r\nremarks to the king about the English in the Transvaal war grated upon\r\nmy informant’s ears. His evident object was to impress the king with the\r\nidea that the Dutch was the dominant power, and to imply that the king’s\r\nrequest for an English resident was not the wish of the nation, but was\r\nlike the petition originally sent to the English government praying for\r\nthe annexation of the Transvaal. This, he said, a few only had sent, a\r\nwar resulted, and the Dutch got back their country; and then he further\r\nwent on to say that he had been sent out to inquire from the king,\r\npersonally, whether he was willing or not to hand over his country to\r\nthe English government. The king then postponed the interview until next\r\nday, revolving in his mind whether Dr. Clark was or was not an\r\nambassador from England, or as General Smith of Majuba history, in\r\nintroducing Dr. Clark to the king, said, an _induna_ (councillor) sent\r\nspecially by the Queen. Next morning the king, in presence of his\r\nprincipal _indunas_, told him (Dr. Clark) that he had no wish to ask\r\neither the English or the Boers to take him over, but as he could\r\nneither read or write, he was treating for an honest white man to look\r\nafter his interests. The conversation, as repeated to me, was a lengthy\r\none, but to make a long story short, Dr. Clark expressed his pleasure at\r\nhearing this, and among other things cautioned the king against granting\r\nconcessions of gold-bearing districts to white men, telling him he was\r\ngiving away the independence of his country. “But,” said the king, “what\r\nam I to do? I am only keeping my promises.” Dr. Clark said: “You can\r\neasily get out of that difficulty; the Transvaal joins; you ask them to\r\nexchange an equal extent of grazing land for a similar extent of\r\ngold-bearing land already conceded.” The king and his councillors on\r\nhearing this burst out into a most sarcastic laugh, the king observing,\r\n“Why should I give stones with gold in them for grass? Have you anything\r\nmore to say?” and then rising bid the deputation “good-bye.” After Dr.\r\nClark, General Smith and their interpreter had gone, the king, turning\r\nto the other white men at his kraal remarked, “He says he comes from the\r\nQueen; but he pleads for the _Transvaal_, that is clear!”\r\n\r\nListening to these interesting statements of eye-witnesses, time flew\r\nrapidly by. On inquiry I learned that this dance would be kept up for\r\ntwo or three days, and as I had yet more than 100 miles to walk before\r\nreaching Delagoa Bay, and was anxious to catch the mail steamer to\r\nEngland, I collected my servants, and taking a last look at the crowd,\r\nwho were all engaged as eagerly as ever, started off again late in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAfter walking about three miles I passed a fine brick-built store, owned\r\nby an enterprising trader named Colenbrander. A little further brought\r\nme to the favorite kraal of the king, where he chiefly resides, when,\r\ndarkness overtaking me, I selected a spot under a large shady tree where\r\nwe spent the night, sleeping round a blazing fire. The air of this\r\nelevated region is stimulating in the extreme; the dryness of the\r\ntransparent atmosphere acting like a charm on the nervous system—every\r\nbreath a draught of sparkling Burgundy or Champagne! Though ready for\r\nsleep as each nightfall came around, I never felt the exhaustion such as\r\na low country produces. We started early next morning and walked on\r\nwithout resting until the middle of the day, when we came to a kraal\r\nwhere we were kindly received. Here we rested a couple of hours during\r\nthe intense heat, refreshing ourselves with cool delicious “amasi” (sour\r\nmilk), which we were fortunate enough to procure from the natives.\r\nLeaving this place just before sundown we struck the wagon-road running\r\nbetween the Tembi and New Scotland in Natal, which was as smooth and\r\nlevel as any colonial road I have seen. Between the kraal where I saw\r\nthe king and my joining the main road, the country was mountainous, but\r\nthe cross foot-path or “short cut” by which my guides brought me ran\r\nchiefly along the mountain ridges, thus giving views diversified and\r\ngrand. I was much struck by the absence of all animal life—no birds,\r\ngame, no animals either wild or tame, added to the beauty of the\r\nlandscape, or relieved the monotony of our journey through these parts.\r\n\r\nWe were now able to walk much more quickly and more easily, so pushing\r\nalong far into the night we again slept in the “veldt.” Resting\r\nuneasily, I persuaded my “boys” to start early, which we did by the\r\nlight of the moon at three in the morning. The Lebombo range, some\r\ntwenty miles distant, over which we had yet to climb, was ever before us\r\nand present to our view, walling in as it were the vast flat, thickly\r\ncovered with mimosa trees, across which our road led us, while at our\r\nback lay the Umzimbi range of mountains we had journeyed over the day\r\nbefore, the towering summit of Mananga closing up the scene. About noon\r\nwe arrived at the foot of the Lebombo range, where we stopped an hour\r\nfor rest and refreshment; after that, a stiff climb and the summit of\r\nthe Lebombo was reached. We walked on a few miles, then another night in\r\nthe open and another day’s weary walk over a most precipitous country! I\r\nshall not forget in a hurry the descent of a tremendously steep and\r\nstony ravine, at the bottom of which ran the Umnyama, a rapid mountain\r\nstream, nor the wading through, nor the ascent beyond! The night rapidly\r\ncame on, and everything was wrapped in a thick mist, when fortunately\r\nfor us we fell into a foot-path, which led us to a house where we were\r\nmost hospitably received and cared for until the morning.\r\n\r\nSunrise saw us all ready to start. A short walk through the veldt\r\nbrought us to the main road along which the descent of the Lebombo range\r\nis made by the easiest gradients. On reaching the bottom and entering\r\nthe valley below, the narrow road bordered by groves of trees, with the\r\ngrass growing exuberantly rank, winded and turned like an English lane,\r\nthe glaring sun and stillness of the air meanwhile making the stifling\r\nheat almost unbearable. Tramping on until the sun was nearly overhead we\r\nrested during the mid-day on the banks of a stream of crystal water\r\nwhich, murmuring its sweet music unseen through the forest glen,\r\nsuddenly appeared flowing along its bed across our path. But as I had\r\ndetermined to reach the Tembi that night, where I was promised that a\r\ntug, which plied between this and Delagoa Bay. would be placed at my\r\ndisposal, and many a long mile having yet to be covered, my readers can\r\nwell suppose that not much time was lost. Everything in this world has\r\nan end, and so had this long day. I cannot describe the almost\r\nunutterable relief the faint shimmer of the river I had so long expected\r\nto see gave me, as in the clouded starlight I caught the first view of\r\nits waters. I eagerly looked for the steam-tug, which to my intense\r\ndelight I found moored to the banks, but never did I more fully\r\nappreciate the truth of the saying in Holy Writ, that “Man is born to\r\ntrouble” as when my hopes were suddenly shattered by learning from the\r\nonly white man there, who, by the way, I found tossing in semi-delirium\r\nfrom malarial fever, that the master of the boat was away. I saw at once\r\nthat there was no other alternative left me but to cross the Tembi and\r\ncontinue my walk next day. The poor fever-stricken fellow was very kind\r\nand invited me into his tent, where he gave me refreshment and a\r\nshake-down, and nothing gave me more pleasure than that this attention I\r\nwas able in some measure to repay by persuading him to accept some\r\nmedicine which I had brought with me to take in the case of a similar\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nThe Tembi, a tidal estuary about one hundred yards broad, is here sixty\r\nmiles from the sea, and has an ebb and flow of some eight feet. I got\r\nfour of my boys to carry me across early next morning when it was\r\nfordable, and began what I thought would be my last day’s journey. Our\r\npath, a narrow Kafir one, lay for miles over what seemed an endless\r\nplain, where silence the most profound reigned supreme, and the thick\r\ntambooti grass waving far over our heads, the dew falling off like rain,\r\nand soaking us through and through. After four hours’ incessant walking,\r\nthe monotony of the path being here and there broken by glimpses of the\r\ndark flowing Tembi, the landscape changed and we came to a part which I\r\ncan compare only to an English park, interspersed ever and anon with\r\ncool and shady groves. Here we began to come across indications of an\r\nincreased population; passing through tracts of cultivated land on which\r\nthe mealies were growing most luxuriantly. Suddenly we arrived at a\r\nlarge Kafir kraal. The style of the huts was different from that of the\r\nSwazis or the Zulus, and showed at once we were among a different race\r\nfrom that we had left a few miles back beyond the Lebombo mountains.\r\nEntering one of the huts I was taken by surprise at seeing a Banyan\r\n(Arab trader) sitting on the floor and articles of European merchandise\r\nexposed for sale. This man could not speak a word of English, but my\r\nboys soon found means to communicate with him, or he perhaps guessed\r\ntheir requirements, as in less than a minute the main curse of\r\ncivilization in the shape of brandy was introduced. This spirit, I\r\nafterwards learned, was imported in large quantities at a cheap rate\r\nfrom Chicago, and I could see was fast working its full share of evil\r\namong these Amatonga tribes.\r\n\r\nThe blazing sun, and the puffs of heated air every now and again blowing\r\nacross our path, tempted us, later in the afternoon, to halt at another\r\nkraal. The head man at once came out and offered to sell us many\r\ndelicacies which we had not tasted for days. Fresh milk, honey, eggs,\r\netc., were brought us, but when a haunch of venison was produced, my\r\nboys fell into such raptures that I could not resist buying it and\r\nstaying to let them cook it, making up my mind to divide the journey and\r\narrive at Delagoa Bay the next day. By sundown our luxurious repast was\r\nfinished, and we all lay down to sleep under the branches of a large\r\ntree that stood in the centre of the kraal. The misery and discomfort of\r\nthat sultry night will ever remain a vivid memory. After a few hours’\r\nrest I was roused up by the patter of heavy rain-drops on the leaves of\r\nthe tree above, and the almost pitchy darkness, now and again\r\nilluminated by flashes of lightning, told me a storm was brewing. To\r\nwhat agony and well-nigh maddening torture was I not awakened! All\r\naround, advancing and retreating. buzzing and singing like a swarm of\r\nangry bees, were millions on millions of mosquitoes, which, as if\r\nsuffering from unappeasable hunger and insatiable thirst, were stinging,\r\nbiting, and sucking my blood, pitiless creatures that they were! Now I\r\nbegan to understand why some would rather hear the lion’s roar than the\r\nhum of the mosquito, as from the one prudence or courage could be a\r\ndefence, while nothing but some “mean” contrivance, as grease, sand,\r\nsmoky smudge or nets could be a protection from the other. So\r\ninsignificant an assailant, yet so venomous and intolerable a little\r\ndemon, is he! My clothes, I soon found, were useless, as these “swamp\r\nangels” revelling in the prospect of the “Carnival of Blood” in store,\r\npierced their powerful, insinuating barbs through everything I had on,\r\nalthough, seeing the small proportion of them that could ever have\r\ntasted human blood, I thought that so many need not have made merry at\r\nmy expense.\r\n\r\nTo lie down again and sleep was an utter impossibility, to rouse my\r\nnatives from the state of perfect oblivion into which their supper had\r\nassisted them seemed cruel, and to remain at the mercy of my tormentors\r\nwas too great an act of self-denial to exercise. The struggle in my mind\r\nwas not long. I roused them quickly up, when piteous were their\r\ncomplaints, until the jingle of gold silenced their reluctance to moving\r\non. The rain had ceased, but yet the night was densely overcast. Not a\r\nfoot-path could be seen. Not a breath stirred the thick and stifling\r\nair, a dead stillness prevailed, the flame of my candle even burning\r\nwithout a flicker, and so carrying it, unprotected in my hand, I\r\npantingly led the way for hours. Again the sullen drops of rain fell\r\nhere and there, and my poor candle did not long escape—one big drop, and\r\ndarkness covered all. I had now to trust to the bare feet and tact of\r\nthe South African native to keep me in the narrow path, and my\r\nconfidence was not misplaced, the light of the candle after all being no\r\nreal loss. The rain now began to pour down in driving torrents, as it\r\ncan do in the tropics only, the heavy leaden clouds shutting out the\r\nfaintest streak of light, while to add to the novelty of the situation\r\nour path led us into dense bush through which we groped in line, holding\r\non, as we walked, to one another, until daybreak. The incessant rain\r\nstill continuing, and my boys seeing a kraal in the distance, made up\r\ntheir minds they would take shelter and with until the worst had passed.\r\nFor a long time I could not dissuade them from stopping, but shivering\r\nand shaking as I was in all my limbs from the cold and rain, and in the\r\ncentre of one of the most malarious districts in South Africa, I knew\r\nthat delay meant fever, so on I determined to go. Money again proved\r\nsuccessful in providing the “sinews of war.” Soon we came to some low\r\nmarshy ground which the Tembi overflows according to the tide. Through\r\nthese I had to wade, when on crossing one part which did not present\r\nanything particular to my attention. I suddenly sank up to my waist in\r\nthe alluvial deposit. Umhlatusi quickly pulled me out, but not before\r\nthe stinking malaria I had stirred up thoroughly sickened me. A little\r\nfurther on we ascended a bank bordering this morass, and then crossing a\r\nnarrow, flat and climbing a sandy ridge struck the shores of the Tembi\r\nnear its mouth, Lourenço Marques lying exactly opposite, two miles away.\r\n\r\nTaking a ferry-boat we sailed across, and a few minutes more saw me\r\nsnugly ensconced in Mr. Otto Berg’s hotel, nine days from Barberton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n  LOURENÇO MARQUES.—THE CHANGES IT HAS SEEN.—HARBOR.—CLIMATE.—RAILWAY\r\nPLANT IMPORTED BY PRESIDENT BURGERS.—ADVANTAGES OF THE DELAGOA BAY ROUTE\r\n                          TO THE GOLD FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLourenço Marques, the name given by the Portuguese to the town they have\r\nbuilt at the head of Delagoa Bay, is the most southerly point of their\r\npossessions, which have a long coast line extending northwards 1,100\r\nmiles. Delagoa Bay, which is one of the finest harbors in the world, was\r\ndiscovered by the Portuguese in 1544, who realizing its importance at\r\nonce took possession and erected a fort and factories. It was early\r\nconverted into a penal settlement, which by strict letter of the law it\r\nstill remains, although at the present time the authorities at Lisbon\r\nhave ceased to use it for that purpose. The white population does not\r\nnumber I should think more than one hundred souls,[115] and this is\r\ncomprised of government officials, officers commanding the garrison,\r\nwhich is composed of black troops from Mozambique or Goa, merchants and\r\ntheir clerks, and the staff of the Eastern Telegraph Company. The town\r\nlies quite low, almost level with the beach, and contains a fine\r\ngovernment house (the Governor Senor Antonio de Azevedo Vasconcellos, to\r\nwhom I paid my respects, is very popular), several well-built trading\r\nestablishments, a handsome church and hospital and a good hotel. The\r\ntelegraph station is situated on a bold headland facing, at a\r\nconsiderable elevation, the Indian Ocean, and commands a splendid view\r\nof the peninsula of Inyack, the Elephant Islands, and the Maputa country\r\nacross the Tembi. Delagoa Bay has seen many changes. In 1721 and 1735\r\nthe Dutch encroached upon the Portuguese, but had ultimately to retire;\r\nagain in 1777 an Austrian trading company, which had established itself\r\nthere, was driven out by the Portuguese Governor General who came from\r\nGoa; then in 1796 the place was taken and destroyed by the French. Once\r\nmore, in 1833, the fortress was besieged and the town entirely sacked by\r\nKafirs; after this, in 1850, internal dissensions almost ruined the\r\nplace, until at last a threatened annexation by the English led to a\r\ndispute in 1861, which was not decided until Marshal MacMahon, Duc de\r\nMagenta, to whom the question had been referred, decided in favor of the\r\nPortuguese in 1875.\r\n\r\nThe climate of this part of the coast has always been considered\r\nunhealthy, nearly all the Europeans staying here for any length of time\r\ncontracting malarial fever of a rather severe type. This is due to\r\nnoxious exhalations from certain swamps which surround one part of the\r\ntown, and to the imprisoned air which is wafted across the Tembi\r\nwhenever a south wind blows from the Maputa territory. Indeed, most of\r\nthe inhabitants suffer from this fever more or less, and have a ghastly,\r\nwoe-begone expression, or as one rather humorous observer remarked to\r\nme, “they all look like corpses out for a holiday.”\r\n\r\nIn walking round the town I came suddenly upon some monuments of the\r\npast, partially buried in sand, which recalled to my memory those words\r\nof Juvenal, where he says, “Monuments themselves memorials need”—for\r\nthere was no one there to tell me that the tons of railway material I\r\nsaw piled and left to rust and decay, were all that was left by which\r\nthe grand railway scheme of President Burgers, and his bright hopes of\r\nthe future, could be remembered.\r\n\r\nThese relics convinced me more than ever that Burgers was a man ahead of\r\nhis time, and the present justifies the opinions he formed years ago.\r\nWhen he went to Europe in 1875 to raise capital to construct the line\r\nfrom Delagoa Bay to the Drakensberg, all other schemes,[116] Moodie’s\r\nincluded, having failed, so sanguine was he of the future that although\r\nhe obtained only £79,136 of the £300,000 he required, yet he spent\r\n£63,200 in railway material alone. The sequel is now a matter of\r\nhistory, how on his return he found all in disorder, the government\r\ncredit gone, Sekukuni in rebellion, the burghers dissatisfied, and, to\r\ncrown everything, he was not so shrewd without being able to see\r\nindications looming in the not far-off future, that the government of\r\nthe State would soon be wrested from his grasp.\r\n\r\nI also saw the railway embankments about seven miles in length which\r\nwere in course of construction by the Portuguese to the Komati River,\r\nnear which their territory ends and the Transvaal commences. This work I\r\nwas informed was being executed by the Portuguese government with money\r\nwhich had been deposited by a Colonel McMurdo as security for commencing\r\nthe line of which he had got a concession in 1883, but which he had not\r\nbegun, and so probably has forfeited.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival in England early this year, 1887, I came to the conclusion\r\nthat this work will now be prosecuted with vigor, as I learned that a\r\ncompany had been successfully floated to continue the formation of the\r\nline, and rumors were afloat in commercial circles that another company\r\nwould at once complete it to Barberton. I have just at hand on going to\r\nthe press the following letter from a friend in Barberton in which he\r\nsays, “About forty miles of the earthwork of the railway is already\r\ncompleted. The contractors have found it quite easy to obtain labor.”\r\nThe intervening country from Barberton to Pretoria, in the one\r\ndirection, and from Kimberley to Pretoria on the other, would then only\r\nremain to complete a grand circular trunk line which would tap every\r\nimportant district and centre in South Africa. Geographically nothing\r\ncould be grander, and as a work of utility few schemes present promise\r\nof greater good to the whole country; as it would be, to my mind, the\r\nsalvation of South Africa from native wars and rapacious coast\r\nmiddlemen, it would prove a great factor in the future amelioration of\r\nthe native races,[117] while further it would tend in time to a\r\nconfederation of interests in South Africa, “a consummation devoutly to\r\nbe wish’d.”\r\n\r\nSo far as Barberton and the Kaap gold fields are concerned, Delagoa Bay\r\nmust be their port of the future, even in spite of the frantic efforts\r\nNatal is now making. It is only necessary to consider for a single\r\nmoment the mileage from the different ports to see this. Whereas the\r\ndistance from Delagoa Bay is, roughly speaking, only 130 miles, that\r\nfrom D’Urban, the Port of Natal, is 450, and that from Capetown about\r\n1,300. The ad valorem duty at these ports also contrasts very\r\nunfavorably with the Portuguese port—Capetown collecting 15, Natal 7,\r\nwhile Delagoa Bay collects 3 per cent. only.\r\n\r\nDuring the last session of the Natal legislative council, with a\r\nhopeless bid to catch the Barberton trade, this sapient body took off\r\nits export duty of 9/ per gallon on spirits, which formerly was a great\r\narticle of export, hoping by this suicidal policy, together with sundry\r\nother minor concessions, to retain the trade, instead of, in my opinion,\r\n“making hay while the sun shines,” or in other words getting the most\r\nout of their rum traffic pending the inevitable, when the Delagoa Bay\r\nrailway is completed.\r\n\r\nThere are no engineering difficulties whatever to be overcome on the\r\nDelagoa Bay route until near the approach to Barberton, and these,\r\nengineers tell me, could be easily surmounted. The much-talked-of ascent\r\nof the Lebombo range can also be made by the most insignificant\r\ngradients, and the Komati River can be bridged with facility; so that\r\nthere is every probability of the shriek of the railway-whistle being\r\nheard, as once at a public dinner at Barberton I told my hearers, in\r\nless than eighteen months. This, as a matter of course, will materially\r\npromote the development and advancement of the gold fields, the\r\ndifficulty and delay attendant upon the importation of machinery will be\r\nremoved, and the thorough opening up of the Kaap gold fields will mark\r\nanother era in the history of South Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n                                L’ENVOI.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait for the _Dunkeld_, the coasting steamer which\r\nruns between Capetown and Mozambique, and after a day and a half’s\r\npleasant sail I landed once more in D’Urban. Here I remained a few days\r\nonly, pending the arrival of the next steamer, but long enough to find\r\nto my cost that I had not crossed the alluvial flats of the Maputa\r\ncountry with impunity. A sudden attack of malarial fever almost\r\nprevented me from prosecuting my journey, as I was scarcely able to\r\nembark when the time came for me to leave, and on reaching Port\r\nElizabeth I was obliged to go into hospital. A few days’ care enabled me\r\nto continue my homeward journey, although, as is usual with this fever,\r\nI am yet reminded at intervals of its pertinacity when once it has\r\ngained a hold upon the system. The results of this fever are usually so\r\nserious and fatal that I have been fortunate in escaping so lightly.\r\n\r\nLeaving Capetown on February 16th, by the S. S. _Northam_, and bidding a\r\nregretful adieu to South Africa, I naturally, when I saw its shores\r\nreceding, turned my thoughts to the future, to the country to which I\r\nwas bound, and to the new interests among which I should be thrown.\r\n\r\nThere is always something sad, as it seems to me, in closing any of the\r\nchapters of the book of one’s existence. It may be oftentimes that the\r\nchange of scene has been eagerly looked forward to, that labors once\r\ncongenial, have proved irksome and well-nigh intolerable, that one has\r\nanticipated release from their bondage with the same feelings as—if the\r\nprofessional simile be pardonable—the long bed-ridden patient expects\r\nthe hour when he may be allowed to move about again, and yet,\r\nnevertheless, there is even, with the most joyful hopes for the future,\r\na certain feeling of regret. “Old custom” has made sweet what would\r\notherwise seem undesirable, and doubtless had the prisoner of Chillon\r\nsuddenly been set free, even after but a few months’ captivity, his\r\ndelight at release would not have been unmingled with an unreasoning,\r\nwistful regard for the very manacles that had bound him. How much more,\r\ntherefore, must I experience this sense of sadness, as I conclude these\r\nvolumes, the elaboration of which has been with me a labor of love,\r\nsince I was inspired with the hope that their publication would serve to\r\ndestroy many a foolish prejudice against these sunny lands, and was vain\r\nenough to trust that they would aid in attracting the attention of\r\nphilanthropists, capitalists, and intending emigrants, to what Lady\r\nFlorence Dixie entitled “The Land of Misfortune,” apt enough perhaps at\r\nthe time that her work was published, but now, I both hope and believe,\r\nlikely to prove a misnomer.\r\n\r\nThe regret that I feel, as I write these brief concluding words, is\r\nintensified by the thought that I have left, perhaps forever, a country\r\nwhere I have found many friends among literally all “sorts and\r\nconditions of men;” among men of every nationality, of hues and natures\r\nthe most diverse, from the stout and stalwart yeoman of England to the\r\npallid yet skillful and versatile disciple of Confucius—from the acute,\r\nsharp-witted, and business-like “stranger” hailing from the land of\r\n“Stars and Stripes” to the sturdy Basuto; from the Scandinavian with his\r\nbright complexion and sunny hair to those “images of God carved in\r\nebony,” the warlike Zulus; from the bright, laughing-eyed sons of the\r\nEmerald Isle, to the dusky worshippers of Vishnu and Siva; from the keen\r\nand cultured member of the Hebrew race, with all its marvellous history,\r\nto the pious adherents of the Prophet of Allah; and from the Africander,\r\ndescended from brave men and noble women who left all they held most\r\ndear on earth for the sake of their faith, to the native toiler in the\r\nmines, who has traversed hundreds of miles in his journey, from his home\r\nin the far interior. Among all, I repeat, have I found many friends, and\r\nI cannot leave them without penning these few words of affectionate\r\nfarewell—words which if wearisome (being purely personal) to the general\r\nreader will, I trust, be accepted in the spirit in which they are\r\nwritten by my South African friends.\r\n\r\nThat I have once and again struck out fairly from the shoulder at\r\nvarious shams and swindles, all who have had the patience to so far\r\nfollow me will perceive, but they will, I hope, also perceive that I\r\nhave been ever ready to give credit where credit was due.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book would be incomplete without a few words on the all-important\r\nsubject of emigration. Poverty, as it is known in England and the Old\r\nWorld, is very rare—I mean of course poverty among those who are, in the\r\ntime-honored phrase, at once “able and willing to work.” That there are\r\nabundant instances of those who prefer frequenting the public-house to\r\nattending to their daily labor is a sad truth, and that there have been,\r\nare, and will be, cases of undeserved misfortune is equally an obvious\r\nmatter of fact. But to those who have a trade at their fingers’ end, or\r\ndo not fear work, manual or mental, have grit or religious principle\r\nenough in them to resist the temptations which, as will be seen by those\r\nwho have perused these chapters, are sure to beset them, I would say,\r\nCome to South Africa—not to be disappointed if after five or six months\r\nyou are little better off than when you came, but to have a tolerable\r\ncertainty of gaining, without a constant dread of work falling short, a\r\ndecent and respectable living. Of the opportunities that present\r\nthemselves to capitalists it is not necessary to speak, as those who\r\nhave read the chapters dealing with the diamond mines and the gold\r\nfields will form their own conclusions. This at least may be said, that\r\nthe man with capital, if he has good advisers, need not fear but that in\r\nalmost any part of South Africa (unless indeed he choose to gamble in\r\nscrip when the best of advisers may be occasionally off their stroke) he\r\nwill receive returns for his expended capital, such as he would hardly\r\nin his most sanguine moments imagine in a day-dream at home. The bona\r\nfide investor (as opposed to the speculator) will probably find that a\r\nvisit to the diamond or gold fields will repay him not only well, but\r\nhandsomely. To the average Englishman South Africa has been more or less\r\na _terra incognito_, and the idea prevailed that it was throughout\r\ninfested with venomous reptiles and colossal lions, while malarial\r\nfevers were only an unavoidable evil. On this subject at least I can\r\nspeak more or less _ex cathedra_. While the summer months, as in all\r\nsubtropical climates, are trying and mean, if more than the usual amount\r\nof rest—I do not mean sleep—be not taken, there will be an excessive\r\nexpenditure of vital force, with the consequent unlikelihood of\r\nlongevity; yet those who are willing to exercise a little care in\r\ndietary, etc., need be under little or no apprehension of the various\r\nlocal fevers; while as I have pointed out, and as will be endorsed by\r\nsome of the most distinguished members of my profession, so far as chest\r\ncomplaints are concerned, the climate of South Africa surpasses that of\r\nsouthern France and at least equals Madeira.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have but once more to bid farewell to my old friends, and my new\r\nfriends, the gentle readers with whom I am unacquainted, and to express\r\nthe hope that they will peruse, if not with profit at all events with\r\nsome interest, these leaves from a diary of TWENTY YEARS IN SOUTH\r\nAFRICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n            COMPARATIVE YEARLY EXPORTS OF DIAMONDS FROM THE\r\n            PROMULGATION OF ACT 48, 1882, TO DECEMBER 31ST,\r\n                                 1886.\r\n                      │            │          │  │  │    │\r\n           ───────────┼────────────┼──────────┴──┴──┼────┴──\r\n                      │  Carats.   │Declared Value. │Average\r\n                      │            │                │  per\r\n                      │            │                │ cent.\r\n           ───────────┼────────────┼──────────┬──┬──┼────┬──\r\n            1882 Four │    796,546⅝│£1,156,273│14│ 6│ 29/│\r\n             months   │            │          │ 1│  │    │\r\n              1883    │  2,413,953⅜│ 2,742,521│ 1│ 0│ 22/│8\r\n              1884    │  2,263,686⅝│ 2,807,288│ 3│ 4│ 23/│9\r\n              1885    │  2,440,788⅜│ 2,492,755│13│ 2│ 20/│5\r\n              1886    │3,135,432⁶⁄₈│ 3,507,210│14│ 0│ 22/│4\r\n           ───────────┼────────────┼──────────┼──┼──┼────┼──\r\n             Total,   │ 11,050,407⅜│12,706,049│ 6│ 0│ 23/│\r\n           ───────────┴────────────┴──────────┴──┴──┴────┴──\r\n\r\n\r\n  CLAUSE II.—OF R.

PRESENTED 21ST\r\n MARCH, 1882, BY J. W. MATTHEWS, M. L. A., SENIOR MEMBER FOR KIMBERLEY.\r\n\r\n  _To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the Honourable House of\r\n  Assembly of the Colony of the Cape of Good Hope, now in Parliament\r\n  Assembled._\r\n\r\nThe humble Petition of the undersigned chiefs, sons and grandsons of the\r\nlate Paramount Chief Moshesh, their councillors, headmen and followers,\r\nhumbly sheweth,—\r\n\r\n1st. That the Peace Preservation Act was proclaimed law in Basutoland by\r\nher Majesty’s High Commissioner and Governor of the Colony of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope, from 21st May, 1880.\r\n\r\n2d. That thereupon your petitioners, her Majesty’s loyal native subjects\r\nof the Basuto nation, did obey the said law, and surrendered their guns,\r\nher most gracious Majesty the Queen having been pleased previously to\r\ncommand their obedience, and to assure them most graciously of her deep\r\ninterest in the welfare of her Majesty’s Basuto subjects, for proof of\r\nwhich your petitioners beg to refer to Earl Kimberley’s letter of 13th\r\nMay, 1880, to his Excellency the Governor, Sir Bartle Frere, which was\r\nduly communicated to your petitioners by the Governor’s agent and chief\r\nmagistrate in Basutoland, Colonel C. D. Griffith, C.M.G.\r\n\r\n3d. That, owing to influences and wicked dispositions, which are now\r\nmatters of history, the greater portion of her Majesty’s subjects in\r\nBasutoland, misled by the chiefs Lerothodi, Masupha, Joel Molapo, and\r\nother minor chiefs, rebelled against her Majesty’s commands, took up\r\narms, slaughtered numbers of her Majesty’s loyal and obedient subjects\r\nfor having obeyed her Majesty’s commands, and carried on open war\r\nagainst her Majesty’s colonial forces.\r\n\r\n4th. That your petitioners, at the risk of their lives, and with the\r\nloss and sacrifice of all they had been possessed of before the\r\nrebellion, in cattle, sheep, horses, grain, wagons, ploughs, houses,\r\nlands and various other properties, remained faithful to her most\r\ngracious Majesty throughout the rebellion, and at her Majesty’s call did\r\neven enroll themselves for active service, fighting her Majesty’s\r\nbattles against their rebellious countrymen at Kalabani, Lerothodi’s\r\nVillage, Mafeting, Makwai’s Berg, Kolo, Tweefontein, Boleka, Maseru,\r\nThlotse Heights, Mohalie’s Hoek and Quithing, in all of which the loyal\r\nBasuto subjects of her Majesty acquitted themselves to the satisfaction\r\nof the Commandant General of Colonial forces, as is most abundantly\r\ntestified to in numerous dispatches, and in the official lists of killed\r\nand wounded.\r\n\r\n5th. That in the month of April, 1881, and after open war had been\r\ncarried on for nine months, negotiations were entered into between her\r\nMajesty’s Governor and High Commissioner and the Basuto chiefs then in\r\nrebellion, when your petitioners, knowing the character, feelings, and\r\nreal objects of the rebel chiefs, as in duty bound, made humble petition\r\nto his Excellency the Governor, setting forth their apprehensions in\r\nregard to the consequences to themselves and their country that would\r\nassuredly arise from any arrangement which would not include a perfect\r\nsubmission of the rebels and the maintenance of a force sufficient to\r\nenforce such submission, to which they never received a reply, nor even\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\n6th. That subsequently, an agreement having been come to between his\r\nExcellency the Governor on one part, and the rebel chiefs of the Basutos\r\non the other part, a document was published in the English language, but\r\nnever publicly given out in Sesuto, bearing the signature of her\r\nMajesty’s Governor, Sir Hercules George Robert Robinson, G. C. M. G.,\r\nknown as the Governor’s Award, bearing date 29th April, 1881, and by\r\nwhich an end was put to actual hostilities in Basutoland.\r\n\r\n7th. That the Governor’s Award having become known to your petitioners,\r\nthey, feeling alarmed at and grieved with the apparent want of any\r\ntangible provision whereby the carrying out of the Award could if\r\nrequired be actually enforced, and further foreseeing great troubles and\r\nmiseries to themselves arising from such a state of things, again\r\napproached his Excellency the Governor by humble petition of 11th of\r\nMay, 1881, setting forth all their apprehensions and grievances, to\r\nwhich humble petition they never received either a reply or\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\n8th. That subsequently, to wit, on the 25th August, 1881, a change of\r\ngovernment took place in Basutoland, Mr. J. M. Orpen succeeding Colonel\r\nC. D. Griffith, C. M. G., in the office of Governor’s agent, and from\r\nthe first day when Mr. J. M. Orpen took over the government of\r\nBasutoland, your petitioners are grieved to say their rights and\r\ninterests as her Majesty’s loyal and obedient subjects were ignored,\r\nthey themselves were treated in every respect as if they had committed a\r\ncrime by remaining loyal, whereas the rebels were encouraged in every\r\nway, and treated with a deference and submission as if their act of\r\nrebellion had been a virtuous and meritorious one; and the Colonial\r\nforces were gradually withdrawn from Basutoland, whilst it was a\r\nnotorious fact that the rebels had not in any way complied with the\r\nconditions of the Award.\r\n\r\n9th. That notwithstanding the open defiance of the Queen’s authority\r\nthroughout Basutoland; notwithstanding the notorious anarchy which\r\nprevailed from one end of the country to the other; notwithstanding the\r\npersistent, obstinate refusal of complying in fact with his Excellency’s\r\nAward on the part of all the rebel chiefs; notwithstanding the repeated\r\ninsults and injuries inflicted upon and forcible expulsion by the rebels\r\nof such of your petitioners as, in accordance with Mr. Orpen’s desires,\r\nhad tried to reoccupy their former grounds; notwithstanding the direct\r\ninsults and affronts offered frequently to the Queen’s representative\r\nand her magistrates in this country by the rebels; and notwithstanding\r\nthe earnest reports of those magistrates in Basutoland who, from many\r\nyears’ experience in the country, were best able to advise the\r\ngovernment as to the real state of affairs; yet, the Acting Governor’s\r\nagent continued and persisted in officially reporting to the government\r\nthat matters were satisfactory, that things were quieting down, that the\r\nLoyals’ cattle were being gradually restored, and that, more\r\nparticularly in Mafeting and Leribe districts, the Loyals had returned\r\nand still were returning to live amongst the rebels, by whom they were\r\nwell received, all of which official reports were diametrically opposed\r\nto real fact.\r\n\r\n10th. That consequently, and as a natural sequence of such a policy, the\r\nconditions of the Governor’s Award remained unfulfilled in almost every\r\nparticular clause thereof: the cattle fine was only partially complied\r\nwith, no guns were surrendered, gun licences were taken up in,\r\ncomparatively speaking, few instances, and then only without even the\r\nproduction, much less the surrender, of a single gun, and on payment of\r\nsuch insignificant sums, that in many instances even the sum of two\r\nshillings and sixpence sterling was accepted, instead of one pound as\r\nlaid down in the Award; the great bulk of the cattle, almost all the\r\nhorses, all the sheep and goats, and every description of movable and\r\nimmovable property belonging to your petitioners, and which, according\r\nto the Award, should have been restored to them, were retained in the\r\nhands of the rebels, who refused to give them up; not a single sixpence\r\nof compensation was made to traders and others for losses inflicted upon\r\nthem during the rebellion, and your petitioners being debarred from\r\nre-entering upon their lands and houses, were kept in the greatest\r\nmisery, depending upon government rations, scarcely adequate to maintain\r\nthemselves and their families, cooped up within confined areas around\r\nthe fortified camps of the diverse seats of magistrates in Basutoland.\r\n\r\n11th. That under these heartrending sufferings, and exposed daily to\r\ninsults and injuries, not only on the part of the rebel Basutos, but,\r\nthey grieve to say it, under continued pressure and insults heaped upon\r\nthem by and through the acting Governor’s agent, your petitioners never\r\nswerving from their loyalty to her Majesty’s government, again, and for\r\nthe third time, approached most humbly his Excellency the Governor by\r\nrespectful petition of 20th October, 1881, setting forth again their\r\nmiseries and grievances, and representing the true state of affairs in\r\nBasutoland, to which humble petition they have never received either\r\nreply or acknowledgment; but the said petition, for reasons unknown to\r\nyour petitioners, was held back by the acting Governor’s agent, from the\r\n20th of October to the end of November or beginning of December, and,\r\nsubsequently, your petitioners were harassed and persecuted beyond\r\nmeasure by the acting Governor’s agent, who persisted in representing\r\nwhat is absolutely untrue—that your petitioners had been instigated by\r\nsome white man to petition his Excellency; that the petition had been\r\nmade by the said white man, and that its contents were not true, whereas\r\nthe said petition was the cry from the hearts of your petitioners, and\r\ncontained nothing but what was absolutely and strictly true; saying\r\nwhich, according to truth, your petitioners nevertheless humbly maintain\r\nthat they have a perfect and constitutional right to ask any man, white\r\nor black, to draft, write, or translate such letters or petitions as\r\nthey may deem expedient to address to the authorities in matters\r\nconcerning their interests, and that neither the Governor’s agent nor\r\nany other official person serving in the government, has a right to\r\nobject to or to discredit such documents bearing your petitioners’\r\nsignatures in any way whatever, on account of such having been drafted,\r\nwritten, or translated for them at their own request by any person\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\n12th. That all the grievances and miseries of your petitioners remaining\r\nunredressed to the present day, the Governor’s Award being succeeded by\r\nan Ultimatum, which holds out the eventuality of an entire cancellation\r\nof the Award, whereby your petitioners, after having been dealt with\r\nmore harshly and unjustly ever since they ventured to exercise their\r\nundoubted rights as free subjects of her Majesty the Queen, to petition\r\nhis Excellency the Governor, would now be cast away entirely, and\r\ndeprived even of the most solemn acknowledgment of their most sacred\r\nrights, which had been clearly laid down in the Award, and all their\r\nmost humble petitions having been studiously ignored, your petitioners\r\nhave but one anchor of hope left to them, to which last anchor they\r\nwould now cling by approaching most humbly and yet most hopefully your\r\nHonourable House with their cries for justice.\r\n\r\n13th. That your petitioners, before the rebellion, were possessed, in\r\nround numbers, of 28,000 head of cattle, 7,000 horses, 29,000 sheep and\r\ngoats, 200 wagons, 400 ploughs, 12,000 bags of grain, and property of\r\nother description to the amount of £12,000 sterling, all of which losses\r\nhave been duly registered at the diverse magistracies, and the lists of\r\nwhich losses will be found on official record, besides the value of\r\ntheir lands and the great comfort of their families, and tribal rights\r\nand positions, which cannot possibly be valued in money, and all of\r\nwhich they sacrificed in order to remain loyal subjects and faithful to\r\nher Majesty’s commands.\r\n\r\n14th. That your petitioners, taking all the obligations of loyal\r\nsubjects upon themselves, are fully aware that they owe, and they are\r\nfully prepared to maintain, that loyalty, as a moral obligation towards\r\ntheir most gracious Sovereign Lady the Queen, even in adversity, and\r\nthey would cheerfully bear all their losses without a murmur, nor would\r\nthey dare to trouble her most gracious Majesty’s government with their\r\ncomplaints and prayers for redress, if they knew or were told by her\r\nMajesty’s government that the power of the government had ceased to be\r\nstrong enough to carry out her Majesty’s promise of protection, or to\r\nenforce the terms of the Award given by her Majesty’s Governor of the\r\nColony of the Cape of Good Hope, in which case your petitioners would\r\nloyally sympathise with her Majesty’s adversities in her dominions in\r\nSouth Africa, and, although poor and miserable by the misfortunes of\r\nwar, they would nevertheless rally round her Majesty’s throne, and,\r\nbeing unable to give any more, they would at least offer their last drop\r\nof blood in the defence of her Majesty’s prestige and in the maintenance\r\nof her Majesty’s rule in South Africa; but\r\n\r\n15th. That your petitioners’ faith in the might and good faith of her\r\nMajesty’s all-powerful rule over her glorious Empire throughout the\r\nworld has not in the least been shaken by recent events in Basutoland;\r\nand they being convinced of this power, and fully confident that their\r\ninterests are now as dear to her Majesty as they were when Earl\r\nKimberley expressed her Majesty’s sentiments towards your petitioners in\r\nhis letter of the 13th May, 1880; and further knowing that the justice\r\nof your petitioners’ claim to be reinstated in all the rights and\r\nproperties lost by reason of their loyalty during the late rebellion has\r\nbeen clearly laid down in his Excellency’s Award, and was acknowledged\r\nas indisputable by both the last and the present responsible Ministers\r\nof the Cape Colony, and being fully convinced that all their present\r\nmiseries and wretched situation is exclusively due to the mistaken\r\npolicy adopted by the present government of Basutoland in dealing with\r\nthe rebellious chiefs.\r\n\r\nYour petitioners, therefore, approach your Honourable House most humbly\r\nand most hopefully, and pray that it may please your Honourable House to\r\ninquire into your petitioners’ case, and if it so please your Honourable\r\nHouse to permit your petitioners to plead their cause at the bar of your\r\nHonourable House, by a deputation of three chiefs whom your petitioners\r\nhave chosen as their spokesmen, and to grant generally such relief to\r\nyour petitioners as your Honourable House may deem meet, and in duty\r\nbound will ever pray.\r\n\r\n                                     JONATHAN MOLAPO,\r\n                                         _Chief of the Leribe District_.\r\n                                     MOKHETHI MOSHESH,\r\n                                     HADIYANA MOSHESHOE,\r\n                                       (And 896 others).\r\n\r\nBASUTOLAND, _March 14, 1882_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PROTEST AGAINST ANNEXATION PRESENTED BY PRESIDENT BURGERS TO SIR\r\n               THEOPHILUS SHEPSTONE ON APRIL 12TH, 1877.\r\n\r\n_Whereas_ I, Thomas Francois Burgers, State President of the South\r\nAfrican Republic, have received a despatch (dated the 9th inst.) from\r\nher British Majesty’s Special Commissioner, Sir Theophilus Shepstone,\r\ninforming me that his Excellency has resolved, in the name of her\r\nMajesty’s government, to bring the South African Republic by annexation\r\nunder the authority of the British crown; and whereas I have not the\r\npower to draw the sword with good success for the defence of the\r\nindependence of this state against a superior power like that of\r\nEngland, and moreover feel totally disinclined, in consideration of the\r\nwelfare of the whole of South Africa, to involve its white inhabitants\r\nin a disastrous war by any hostile action on my part, without having\r\nemployed beforehand all means to secure the rights of the people in a\r\npeaceful way: Therefore, I do hereby, in the name and by authority of\r\nthe government and the people of the South African Republic, solemnly\r\nprotest against the intended annexation.\r\n\r\nGiven under my hand and under the seal of the state, at the government\r\noffice at Pretoria, on this the 11th day of April, in the year 1877.\r\n\r\n                              PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_ her Majesty’s Special Commissioner, Sir Theophilus\r\n  Shepstone, has thought fit, in spite of my solemn protest entered\r\n  yesterday against his Excellency’s intention communicated to me by\r\n  missive dated 9th of April, to carry out that intention, and has\r\n  to-day proclaimed the authority of her Britannic Majesty’s government\r\n  over the South African Republic; and\r\n\r\n  _Whereas_ the government has decided to submit provisionally under\r\n  protest for the purpose of, in the meantime, sending to Europe and\r\n  America a deputation, in the persons of Messrs. S. J. P. Kruger and E.\r\n  P. Jorissen, for the purposes of defending the right of the people and\r\n  for endeavoring to arrive at a peaceful solution of the matter:\r\n\r\n  Now, therefore, I, Thomas Francois Burgers, State President of the\r\n  South African Republic, hereby, on behalf and by advice of the\r\n  executive, command all officials, burghers and inhabitants, to abstain\r\n  from every word and every deed of violence by which the work of the\r\n  deputation may be made fruitless, and I exhort all burghers and\r\n  inhabitants to assist in maintaining the decision of the government\r\n  and in the preservation of order and the prevention of bloodshed.\r\n\r\n                                              THOS. BURGERS,\r\n                                                      _State President_.\r\n\r\n  GOVERNMENT OFFICE, Victoria, _April 12, 1877_.\r\n\r\nShortly after the proclamations were read, most of the officials\r\nassembled in the Volksraadszaal, where his Honor the President addressed\r\nthem, in a state of great emotion, very nearly in the following words:\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, officials of the South African Republic: You are no\r\nstrangers in the land. You also know what the government has resolved to\r\ndo. We bow only to the superior power. We submit because we cannot\r\nsuccessfully draw the sword against that superior power, because by\r\ndoing so we would only plunge the country into deeper miseries and\r\ndisasters. We have resolved to appeal to England herself; and if we get\r\nno redress there, then we will seek the friendly intervention of other\r\npowers that have acknowledged our independence. I have called you\r\ntogether to make one request to you: continue to occupy your offices in\r\nabeyance of the result of this appeal. No other oath of office will be\r\ndemanded from you, and you can continue to serve under the oath once\r\nsworn to the Republic. I have pledged my word for you, and I know I can\r\ndepend upon you that you will not disappoint me. Serve the new\r\ngovernment with the same honesty and fidelity with which you have served\r\nour government, for by that you will serve the people. I am leaving my\r\noffice under protest on behalf of myself, of the government, of the\r\nofficials, of the Volksraad, and of the people. Grant me therefore this\r\none favor, that you serve the people so long, and redeem the pledge that\r\nI have given for you. I thank you for the fidelity which you have shown\r\nme in your posts as officials. I leave my office with the certainty that\r\nI have not offended any one of you willfully, and if I have perhaps done\r\nso from weakness, I ask you to forgive me.”\r\n\r\nMr. Consul of Belgium: “You are the only representative of a foreign\r\npower present here to-day. You know what has happened here to-day, and\r\nyou know also what has caused this event, and of course you will\r\ncommunicate every thing to your government. I thank your government,\r\nyour king, your people and yourself, for the brotherly hand offered by\r\nBelgium to this youthful Republic. Be you my spokesman to your king and\r\npeople, and tell them that, although the government be altered, yet the\r\npeople remain. Meanwhile I request you, Mr. Consul, that you remain here\r\nat your post until the result of the protest shall be known. And now,\r\ngentlemen, for the moment I leave the scene. I wish you God’s richest\r\nblessing. Farewell. Be true to yourselves, to the people and to the\r\ngovernment.”\r\n\r\nMr. Swart briefly addressed his Honor in a few words of farewell,\r\nuttering the hope that the day may soon come when we would again welcome\r\nhim as head of the state. He then handed to his Honor the key of the\r\ngovernment office.\r\n\r\nHis Honor said: “Here is the key of our office. I hand it over to the\r\nsuperior power and thereby give it into the hands of God, who will at\r\nthe proper time deliver it to the right man. I order you—it is my last\r\norder—to deliver it to the chief of the new government and conduct\r\nyourselves worthily as men and officers. Farewell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ZULU ULTIMATUM.\r\n    _Message from his Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Natal to\r\n     Cetywayo, King of the Zulus and chief men of the Zulu nation._\r\n\r\n1. The Lieutenant Governor of Natal sends, in the name of the Queen’s\r\nHigh Commissioner, these further words to the Zulu king and nation.\r\n\r\n2. These are the words of the High Commissioner and they are sent by the\r\nLieutenant Governor, through the same officers who delivered the words\r\nof the Award in respect of the disputed boundary question, namely:—The\r\nHon. John Wesley Shepstone, Secretary of Native Affairs, Natal; the Hon.\r\nCharles Brownlie, Resident Commissioner for Native Affairs in the Cape\r\nColony, at present attached to the staff of the High Commissioner; Mr.\r\nHenry Francis Fynn, Resident Magistrate, Umsinga Division, Natal; and\r\nColonel Forester Walker, of her Majesty’s Scots Guards, lately attached\r\nto the staff of the High Commissioner; to be delivered by them to the\r\nZulu representatives, that they may be duly communicated to the king and\r\ncouncil and people of the Zulu nation.\r\n\r\n3. The king and nation will recognize in the Award that has just been\r\ngiven on the matter of the disputed boundary, the determination of the\r\nBritish government to give effect to the words which have been spoken at\r\ndifferent times by its representatives in this country regarding the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n4. The dispute respecting the boundary was one that had existed for many\r\nyears. It was a question between the government of the Transvaal\r\nRepublic and the Zulu nation. The latter made many and frequent\r\nrepresentations to the Natal government on the subject. The government\r\nof Natal was always anxious that the dispute should be settled by\r\npeaceful means, and always counselled the Zulu king accordingly. It\r\nconsidered that the dispute might be and could be settled properly and\r\nsatisfactorily, by means of an impartial inquiry; and was always ready\r\nto use its good offices for that purpose. The opportunity for doing so,\r\nhowever, did not occur. The years passed without any settlement of the\r\nquestion, and at length last year the Transvaal came under British rule.\r\nNow when that took place, the Zulu king, if he trusted the British\r\ngovernment, had every reason to believe that whatever rights the Zulus\r\nmight have in the disputed territory would be investigated and accorded\r\nto them. But, without waiting, the king sent armed Zulus on to the\r\ndisputed territory, and by threats obliged the European settlers in it\r\nto leave their homes. This proceeding on the part of the Zulu king might\r\nwell have been resented by the English government: but having regard to\r\nthe promises and words of its representatives in times past, and\r\ndesirous to avoid all appearance of prejudging a long-standing question\r\nin which its own interests had become involved, it withheld its hand in\r\norder that the inquiry so long spoken of might be held.\r\n\r\n5. The inquiry was instituted by the government of Natal, and was held\r\nby trusty persons appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Natal. It was\r\nheld in the presence of the representatives both of the Transvaal\r\ngovernment and the Zulu king and nation, and all that was said and put\r\nforward in support of these claims by both parties was heard and\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\n6. It is clear from the inquiry that some negotiations took place\r\nbetween Cetywayo and the Boers in 1861. Cetywayo’s right of succession\r\nto the late king Panda was then very uncertain. Two other sons of Panda\r\nwere in the hands of the Boers, and the evidence goes to show that\r\ncertain promises to cede land were made by Cetywayo, partly in order to\r\nobtain the surrender of these two sons of Panda, and partly in\r\nconsideration of presents of cattle.\r\n\r\n7. What were the extent and character of the promises made by Cetywayo\r\nhas since been disputed, but promises of some sort there undoubtedly\r\nwere. Certain land was also beaconed off, but no recognition or\r\nconfirmation of the cessions said to have been promised appears ever to\r\nhave been given by the king Panda, or by the great council of the Zulus,\r\nand accordingly the commissioners who inquired into the dispute, after\r\ncareful deliberation, recorded their finding against any authoritative\r\nor sufficient cession of that land having been made by the king or\r\nnation. This decision has been accepted by the High Commissioner and has\r\nnow been communicated to the Zulu king and nation. This Award assigns as\r\nbelonging to the Zulu nation, and as subject to the Zulu king, a great\r\nportion of the disputed land claimed by the king, which lies between the\r\nBuffalo and Pongola Rivers.\r\n\r\n8. But while the British government in this way gives up to the Zulu\r\nking and nation land which is thought by the commissioners to be by\r\nstrict right belonging to the Zulus, and while the British government\r\nhas, and always will have, a due regard for it, at the same time will\r\nstrictly require all that is due to its own honors and the just rights\r\nand interests of the Queen’s subjects.\r\n\r\n9. It has already been intimated in connection with the Award, which was\r\nan Award regarding the territory lying on this or the south side of the\r\nPongola River, that on the other, or north side of that river, the Zulu\r\nking must not, as he has of late appeared inclined to do, attempt to\r\ntake any action in respect of that territory, as if he had any right or\r\njurisdiction there, but that if the king has, or thinks he has, any\r\nclaim of any nature in that direction, he must state them to the British\r\ngovernment, by whom they will be duly considered.\r\n\r\n10. The High Commissioner has under his consideration the proceedings\r\nconnected with the outrage that was committed some months ago in Natal\r\nterritory by Zulu subjects, the sons, relatives and people of the Zulu\r\nchief Sirayo. This has been a grievous and gross outrage committed on\r\nBritish territory. Mehlokazulu, Inkumbokazulu and Tyekwana, sons of\r\nSirayo, and Zuluhlenza, a brother of Sirayo, with a large number of\r\narmed attendants, crossed the Buffalo River into Natal territory in two\r\nparties, and by force and violence took out of Natal territory two Zulu\r\nwomen. Having taken these women back into the Zulu country, they there,\r\nas it is reported, killed them.\r\n\r\n11. The Lieutenant Governor of Natal, when he heard of these\r\noccurrences, sent messages, one on the 1st and another on the 6th of\r\nAugust, to the king, stating what had occurred, and requesting that the\r\nsons and relatives of Sirayo, the ringleaders of the outrages, should be\r\ngiven up to the Natal government for punishment for the offences\r\ncommitted by them in Natal territory. Cetywayo, in reply, admitted that\r\nSirayo’s people had done wrong, but he has endeavored to make light of\r\nthe offence, and he has not given up the men as desired. Instead of\r\ndoing this, they sent £50, which he wished the Natal government to\r\naccept as a fine in lieu of the punishment of Sirayo’s people. The money\r\nwas not accepted, and the king was told that such a fine would be no\r\npunishment for those guilty of the offence, and no reparation for the\r\noutrage. The king said, however, that he would lay the matter and demand\r\nof the Lieutenant Governor before his great council; but many weeks have\r\npassed and no further intimation has been received by the Natal\r\ngovernment to show that the king has laid the matter before the council,\r\nor what the deliberations of the council has been.\r\n\r\n12. Her Majesty’s High Commissioner has now therefore to require that\r\nthe Zulu king will forthwith send in to the Natal government for trial\r\nunder the laws of the Colony, for the offence committed by them in the\r\nColony, the persons of Mehlokazulu, Inkumbokazulu, and Tyekwana, the\r\nsons of Sirayo, and also Zuluhlenza, the brother of Sirayo, who was\r\nwrongly accused, as he was not one of the party who came into Natal\r\nterritory, but was at Umhlan-den-Hlorn at the time; he is accordingly\r\nexempted from this demand, but the others now demanded must be sent in\r\nand delivered over to the Natal authorities within twenty days from the\r\ndate that this demand is made. The Zulu king is required, in addition,\r\nto pay to the British government a fine of 500 head of cattle for the\r\noutrage, and for his delay in complying with the request of the Natal\r\ngovernment. These cattle must also be sent in within the period above\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n13. There has also been another offence committed by Zulu subjects on\r\nthe persons of British subjects at Middle Drift on the Tugela River,\r\nbelow Fort Buckingham. These two British subjects, Messrs. Smith and\r\nDeighton, were, while at or near the drift in the month of September\r\nlast, surrounded by a party of fifteen Zulus who, armed with guns and\r\nassegais, in an excited state, took hold of the two white men, and made\r\nthem sit down, demanding what they were doing there, as the ground\r\nbelonged to Cetywayo. Gradually the Zulus became more quiet, and after\r\ndetaining the two white men for an hour and a half, or thereabouts, they\r\nallowed them to go. This interference with and treatment of two British\r\nsubjects was an interference and treatment which was unwarrantable. It\r\nwas an offence against the persons of two British subjects which cannot\r\nbe passed over without notice, and as a punishment for the offence, and\r\na warning against the commission of similar offences in the future, the\r\nHigh Commissioner requires that a fine of 100 head of cattle shall be\r\npaid to the British government. This fine must also be paid within the\r\nperiod of twenty days from the date of the communication being made.\r\n\r\n14. The two cases referred to have been cases of offence—one of them of\r\na most serious and outrageous nature—committed by individual Zulu\r\nsubjects on British territory, or against the persons of British\r\nsubjects, for which it has been found necessary to demand that\r\nreparation shall be made in the manner above stated.\r\n\r\n15. There is also the case of Umbelini, a Swazi refugee living in the\r\nZulu country, who is charged with having recently made a murderous raid\r\ninto the country north of the Pongola River, which is claimed as British\r\nterritory by the Transvaal government. It will be necessary for the\r\noffenders in this case to be given up to be tried by the Transvaal\r\ncourts for the offence of which they have been accused, and a further\r\ncommunication will be made to Cetywayo when the Transvaal government has\r\nstated who, besides Umbelini, must be given up to be tried.\r\n\r\n16. But beyond these matters which relate to certain offences committed\r\nby certain Zulu subjects against the British government, the attention\r\nof her Majesty’s Commissioner has of necessity been given to the state\r\nof government and the state of affairs in the Zulu country, as affecting\r\nboth the conditions of the Zulu people and the peace and safety of the\r\nQueen’s dominions lying adjacent to Zululand, and of other tribes and\r\npeoples, the allies or friendly neighbors of the British government.\r\n\r\n17. In the time of the late king Panda the relations of the British\r\ngovernment and the Zulus had always been of a friendly nature. The\r\nEnglish government and the Zulus were near neighbors, and all the Zulu\r\nnation can bear witness that the English government never did anything\r\nunfriendly, or showed in any way otherwise than most friendly and well\r\ndisposed towards the Zulus. Panda, it is well known, was established in\r\nthe chieftainship by the Dutch emigrant farmers, who defeated the Zulu\r\nking Dingaan. It was after this that the English came into Natal and\r\nestablished relations with Panda and the Zulu nation.\r\n\r\n18. Panda’s reign was a more peaceful one than those of his\r\npredecessors, and his rule was milder and more tolerant. He encouraged\r\ntrade. He allowed Christian missionaries to settle on the land, and set\r\naside stations for them and gave them land, and there was good promise\r\nof an improvement in the condition of the Zulu people.\r\n\r\n19. Unhappily, during the latter part of his reign, and when he became\r\nold, trouble came upon the land in consequence of the difference between\r\nCetywayo and his brothers as to who should be successor to the king.\r\n\r\n20. Panda had always behaved in a loyal and friendly manner to the\r\nBritish government, and when, on account of the continued excitement and\r\nuneasiness in the Zulu country, he asked the Natal government to\r\ninterfere, the government sent Mr. Shepstone, the Secretary for Native\r\nAffairs, to recommend Panda to nominate a successor, and so remove the\r\nuncertainty on that point, and the cause of dispute among the brothers.\r\nThe result was the nomination of the house of Cetywayo, which, settling\r\nthe dispute of succession, gave quiet again to the Zulu country.\r\n\r\n21. After the death of Panda, the sons of the late king, and the headmen\r\nof the Zulu nation, assembled and sent messengers to the government of\r\nNatal saying that the nation found itself wandering because of the death\r\nof the king. “There was no king,” they said, and the messengers brought\r\nfrom the nation four oxen, representing the “Head of the king” to the\r\nNatal government. They further asked that Mr. Shepstone, who had been\r\npresent at the nomination of Cetywayo, might go and establish what was\r\nwanted, and, at the same time, breathe the spirit by which the nation\r\nshould be governed. They said, moreover, it was the will of the nation\r\nthat the new king should be the son of the British government.\r\n\r\n22. The government of Natal had no wish to mix itself up with these\r\narrangements of the Zulu people; but eventually it consented and sent\r\nMr. Shepstone to take part in the installation. It was the wish of\r\nCetywayo that this should be done—it was the wish of the whole Zulu\r\nnation. In consenting to this, the British government had no selfish\r\nobject of any kind. It did not seek to obtain a single foot of land for\r\nitself, nor any advantage nor any privilege whatever. It wanted nothing\r\nfor itself, and demanded nothing for itself. Its only motive in\r\ncomplying with the wish of the Zulu nation, and in taking part in the\r\ncoronation of the new king, was that in doing so it might help to assure\r\nthe peace of the Zulu country and promote in some degree the welfare of\r\nthe Zulu people.\r\n\r\n23. In taking part, therefore, the only conditions it made were in favor\r\nof the good government of the people. At a formal meeting held previous\r\nto the installation between Mr. Shepstone, Cetywayo and the headmen of\r\nthe Zulu nation, several matters were discussed, chief among which were\r\ncertain regulations or laws for the better government of the Zulu\r\npeople, which were to be proclaimed on the occasion of the installation.\r\nSubsequently, on the day of the installation, the laws were formally\r\nproclaimed by Mr. Shepstone.\r\n\r\n24. It was proclaimed:\r\n\r\n  1. That the indiscriminate shedding of blood should cease in the land.\r\n\r\n  2. That no Zulu should be condemned without open trial and the public\r\n  examination of witnesses, for and against, and that he should have the\r\n  right of appeal to the king.\r\n\r\n  3. That no Zulu’s life should be taken without the previous knowledge\r\n  and consent of the king, after such trial has taken place, and the\r\n  right of appeal had been allowed to be exercised.\r\n\r\n  4. That for common crimes, the loss of property, all or a portion,\r\n  should be substituted for the punishment of death.\r\n\r\n25. Now these laws were formally proclaimed by Mr. Shepstone, who\r\nrepresented the British government in Natal, and proclaimed with the\r\nformal consent of Cetywayo, of the chief men of the nation, and of the\r\nnatives then assembled. It was not done as a mere idle ceremony or form:\r\nit was not done in secret but in public; it was not done in the dark,\r\nbut in the open day; it was not done in solitude, but at the royal\r\nkraal, in the presence and the hearing of the king, the chiefs and the\r\nassembled people. They were laws for the good government of the Zulu\r\npeople. The subject of them had been carefully and deliberately\r\ndiscussed beforehand between the British representatives and Cetywayo\r\nand his councillors, and agreed upon, and then afterwards, in the\r\nhearing and presence of the people, the laws had been solemnly affirmed.\r\n\r\n26. These laws for the well-being of the Zulu people were the conditions\r\nrequired by the British government, in return for the countenance and\r\nsupport given by it to the new Zulu king, by the presence of its\r\nrepresentative, and by his taking part in the king’s coronation; and\r\nonce spoken as they were, they cannot be broken without compromising the\r\ndignity, the good faith, and the honor of the British government.\r\n\r\n27. The British government now asks, How has it been in this matter?\r\nHave the promises then made been kept? Have the laws which were then\r\nproclaimed been observed? Let the Zulu king answer!\r\n\r\n28. There is but one answer. The king and people know very well that the\r\npromises have not been kept. They know that these laws have not been\r\nobserved, but that they have been broken time after time, and that they\r\nare almost daily broken in the Zulu country. They know very well that\r\nthe lives of hundreds of Zulu people, men, women, old and young, have\r\nbeen taken since that day without any trial at all, that the\r\nindiscriminate shedding of blood has not ceased, and that the killing of\r\nZulu people has gone on as if no promise had ever been made, and no law\r\never proclaimed.\r\n\r\n29. Hence it is that all Zulus live in fear to lose their lives any day.\r\nNo man knows when he may be suddenly set upon and killed, and all\r\nbelonging to him destroyed or taken away.\r\n\r\n30. How can these things be? Were the words which were spoken at the\r\ncoronation mere empty words, meaning nothing? The Zulu king knows that\r\nit is not so, and that it cannot be so. The British government in Natal\r\ndid not want, and it did not ask, to take any part in the installation\r\nof Panda’s successor. It wished well to the Zulu country and the Zulu\r\npeople, but for itself it wished for nothing, it asked for nothing. It\r\nwas Cetywayo himself, it was the Zulu nation assembled together, that\r\nsent to the government to ask it to take part. Even then the government\r\ndid not desire to take any part in what was being done, but it consented\r\nto do so, asking nothing for itself, but asking certain conditions for\r\nthe good of the Zulu people.\r\n\r\n31. The conditions which it asked were conditions for the protection of\r\nthe lives of the Zulu people, that they might not be condemned and slain\r\nwithout trial, without knowing what their offence was, without cause,\r\nand without chance of justice. These were the laws proclaimed.\r\n\r\n32. The British government cannot, then, allow that the words which were\r\nonce spoken on its part should be empty words, or that the promises\r\nwhich were made to it, and for which it became the mouthpiece and the\r\nguarantee to the whole Zulu nation, should be treated as if they were\r\nmere idleness and empty sound. But for five years they have been so\r\ntreated, and now it can be no longer so.\r\n\r\n33. The promises have not been kept, and how is it possible they can be\r\nkept so long as the present system of government is maintained by the\r\nking?\r\n\r\n34. The present system of government is destroying the country. All the\r\nyoung men, all the able-bodied men of the country, are taken as\r\nsoldiers. They are taken from their homes at an age when they are\r\nbecoming useful to their parents, and are kept for several years in the\r\ncompulsory service of the king. They are not allowed to marry, as the\r\nother men around them, as in Natal, as among the Amaswagi, as among the\r\nAmapondo. They cannot marry when they desire to do so, but they must\r\nawait the permission of the king, and they are often kept for seven\r\nyears without the permission to do so. They are not allowed to labor for\r\nthemselves, or to plant, or to reap, or to live in quiet and in peace\r\nwith their families and relatives. They are constantly summoned up to\r\nthe king’s kraals, as if for war, although there is no enemy to fight\r\nwith, and thus they come to fight among themselves, and blood is shed,\r\nand there is distress and moaning in the land; or they are sent out in\r\nparties to surround the kraals of those who have given offence to the\r\nking, or who are accused by private enemies, and who then, without trial\r\nand without a word, are killed, their kraals laid desolate, and their\r\nfamilies, and all they have, carried off and destroyed.\r\n\r\n35. Thus the army is made an instrument, not for the defence of the\r\ncountry but for the oppression of the people. All the best interests of\r\nthe Zulu country and the happiness of the Zulu people are sacrificed in\r\norder that the king may keep up this large army. For what purpose is\r\nthis army kept up? Is there an enemy? Where is the enemy? Cetywayo knows\r\nvery well that there is no enemy, and that there is no occasion for this\r\nlarge army. In the days of Chaka or Dingaan it might be different, but\r\nnow on all sides of the Zulu country is the territory of the British\r\ngovernment, or of its allies and friendly neighbors. The king knows very\r\nwell that the British government is a peaceful and friendly power, and\r\nthat it wishes well to the Zulu people, and that it wishes them to live\r\nin peace and comfort. The king knows this well, for did not his father\r\nlive to become an old man under the shelter of the British government,\r\nand has not Cetywayo himself grown up to manhood under the eye of the\r\nEnglish?\r\n\r\n36. With regard to the native neighboring tribes, the Basuto, Amapondo,\r\nthe Amaswagi, and others, they are either the subjects or the allies or\r\nneighbors of the British government, and the Zulu king knows he has\r\nnothing to fear from them. They are, besides, peaceful people and not\r\ngiven to war and aggression.\r\n\r\n37. For what purpose then does the Zulu king keep up this large army,\r\nwhich brings so much hardship and so much misery upon the Zulu people\r\nthemselves? It can serve no good purpose. It can be made of no use,\r\nexcept it be used for the oppression of the Zulu people or for\r\naggression upon British subjects or the allies and neighbors of the\r\nBritish government.\r\n\r\n38. There is, therefore, no real need for the army. The present system\r\nis working the destruction of the Zulu people. The army was used against\r\nthe very people of the country to which it belongs. It is the strength\r\nof the nation destroying the nation itself.\r\n\r\n39. Let the natives say if this is not so? Besides, while the king keeps\r\nup this army, while he is continually calling it together, it is\r\nimpossible for his neighbors to feel secure. They never know what may\r\nhappen, and the British government is obliged to keep large numbers of\r\nthe Queen’s troops in Natal and the Transvaal in order to protect\r\nBritish subjects against the dangers of a possible aggression by the\r\nZulu king.\r\n\r\n40. This state of things cannot last. It is dangerous to the peace of\r\nall the countries adjoining Zululand, and it is hurtful to the Zulu\r\npeople themselves. The British government cannot allow it to continue.\r\nIt has become absolutely necessary that some change should be made.\r\n\r\n41. It is necessary that the military system which is at present kept up\r\nby the king should be done away with as a bad and hurtful one, and that\r\nhe should instead adopt such military regulations as may be decided on\r\nafter consultation with the great council of the Zulus, and with the\r\nrepresentatives of the British government.\r\n\r\n42. It is necessary that the Zulu army, as it is now, shall be\r\ndisbanded, and that the men shall return to their homes.\r\n\r\n43. Let the obligation on every able-bodied man to come out for the\r\ndefence of his country, when it is needed, remain, but until then let it\r\nbe that every man shall live, if he please, quietly at his own home.\r\n\r\n44. Let every man then be free to remain at his home, and let him plant\r\nand sow, and reap and tend his cattle, and let him live in peace and\r\nwith his family.\r\n\r\n45. Let him not be called out for war or for fighting or for assembling\r\nin regiments, except with the permission of the great council of the\r\nnation assembled, and with the consent also of the British government.\r\n\r\n46. Let every man, when he comes to man’s estate, be free to marry. Let\r\nhim not wait for years before he gets permission to do this, for\r\noftentimes the king forgets to give the permission, and the years pass\r\non and the man becomes old. But let him be free to marry when he\r\npleases, as it is in Natal.\r\n\r\n47. So will the king have contented subjects.\r\n\r\n48. Then with respect to the promises made at the coronation, let rules\r\nat once be laid down that any Zulu, man or woman, old or young, who is\r\naccused of any crime, be tried by properly appointed indunas before\r\npunishment, that no one may be punished without cause, and that the life\r\nof no one be taken until the offence of which he is accused be heard\r\nopenly against him; and on answers given by him in self-defence, in\r\norder that those by whom he is tried may say whether he is guilty or not\r\nbefore he is punished: and if any one is declared guilty let him not be\r\nkilled before the king has given his consent, and until the person\r\ndeclared guilty has been able to make an appeal to the king.\r\n\r\n49. Thus it was promised it should be at the time of the coronation, but\r\nthe promises have not been kept.\r\n\r\n50. But in future it will be necessary that the promises be kept, for\r\nthe British government holds itself bound to see that this is so; and in\r\norder that they may be kept, and that the laws regarding them may be\r\nduly carried out, the Queen’s High Commissioner, on behalf of the\r\nBritish government, will appoint an officer as his deputy to reside in\r\nthe Zulu country, or on its immediate borders, who will be the eyes and\r\nears and mouth of the British government towards the Zulu king and the\r\ngreat council of the nation.\r\n\r\n51. What words the king or the council of the nation may desire to say\r\nto the British government can then be said through this officer, and\r\nalso what words the British government may desire to say to the king and\r\nthe great council can be said through him, so that all misunderstanding\r\nand questions that arise between the two countries, or between the\r\nsubjects of the two countries, may be dealt with and settled through\r\nthis one officer speaking with the king and the great council.\r\n\r\n52. This officer will see that the rules regarding the trials of all\r\nZulus before punishment are kept, and that no man is killed without\r\ntrial, but that all men may have an opportunity of answering the\r\naccusations brought against them, and if need be of appealing to the\r\nking.\r\n\r\n53. He will see also that the arrangements to be made regarding the army\r\nare carried out; that no one is called out for war without necessity;\r\nthat all men are allowed to live at their homes in peace; and that every\r\nyoung man is free to marry. So will it be well with the Zulu people.\r\n\r\n54. The late king Panda allowed several European missionaries to settle\r\nin Zululand. Cetywayo also allowed them to stay in the country, but\r\nduring the last two years some of the natives living on the mission\r\nstations were killed without trial, or form of trial, and others were\r\nterrified, and thus the missionaries have, most of them, been obliged to\r\nabandon their stations; and the High Commissioner desires that all those\r\nmissionaries who, until the last year, lived in the Zulu country and\r\noccupied stations, as also the natives belonging to the stations, be\r\nallowed to return and occupy their stations. He desires also that all\r\nmissionaries be allowed to teach, as in Panda’s time, and that no Zulu\r\nshall be punished for listening to them. If any Zulu wishes, of his own\r\nchoice, to listen to the missionary he is free to do so. If any native\r\nliving on a mission station does wrong, he will be liable to punishment,\r\nbut he must be tried first.\r\n\r\n55. If any case of dispute occurs in which any of the missionaries, or\r\nin which any European is concerned, such dispute should be heard by the\r\nking in public and in the presence of the British resident; and no\r\nsentence of expulsion from Zululand shall be carried out until it has\r\nbeen communicated by the king to the Resident, and until it has been\r\napproved by the Resident.\r\n\r\n56. These are the words of her Majesty’s High Commissioner, which the\r\nLieutenant Governor of Natal sends to the Zulu king and the chief men of\r\nthe nation, and for the whole Zulu nation,\r\n\r\n57. These are the conditions which her Majesty’s High Commissioner, in\r\nthe name of the British government, considers necessary for the\r\nestablishment of a satisfactory state of things in the Zulu country, and\r\nfor the peace and safety of the adjoining countries. Let, therefore, the\r\nking and the chief men of the nation consider them, and let them give\r\ntheir answer regarding them within thirty days from the day on which\r\nthis communication is made to the Zulu representatives, in order that\r\nher Majesty’s High Commissioner may then know if the king and the great\r\ncouncil agree to the words which are here given, and will give effect to\r\nthese conditions, which are necessary both for the peace and safety of\r\nthe Queen’s subjects and allies and also for the safety and welfare of\r\nthe Zulu people, to which the Queen’s government wishes well.\r\n\r\n                                      (Signed)\r\n                                              HENRY BULWER,\r\n                                                  _Lieutenant Governor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JOHN DUNN’S LETTER.\r\n                _To the Aborigines Protection Society_—\r\n\r\nI beg to write, for the information of your honorable Society, and state\r\nthat I am an Englishman by birth, and have been a resident of the Zulu\r\ncountry, and living among the Zulus, for the last twenty years, and I\r\ncan confidently say that there is no white man in this part of South\r\nAfrica so fitted to judge of their feelings towards the English race as\r\nI am.\r\n\r\nI would not now address your honorable Society if it were not that I\r\nhave noticed a very strong, wrong and arbitrary feeling gaining ground\r\nagainst the Zulu nation on the side of the white population in this part\r\nof South Africa. A strong feeling of color and jealousy I cannot\r\nunderstand, unless it is on account of the independency of the Zulu\r\nrace, a feeling taken up without any just cause, and that feeling is now\r\non the verge of breaking out on the pretext of a false claim of land\r\nboundary; a claim pretended to being upheld for the Dutch Boers, who are\r\nno friends of the English race, and are well known in this part of South\r\nAfrica for their encroaching propensities on any land belonging to the\r\nnatives of this country, to evade English laws, on the pretext of\r\ngetting permission to graze cattle, on the grass becoming scarce on\r\ntheir own farms, and afterwards claiming the land. A claim in which the\r\nNatal government have always upheld the Zulus, and now, since the\r\nannexation of the Transvaal (in 1877), the head of the government there,\r\nwho professed to side with the Zulus while he was in Natal, has now\r\nturned round and claimed for the Dutch a country thickly inhabited by\r\nthe Zulus.\r\n\r\nI write this for the information of your honorable Society, in the hope\r\nthat you will try and put a stop to proceedings which will, if carried\r\nout, be the cause of bloodshed in an unjust cause, as I can assure you\r\nnothing but the grossest act of encroachment and oppression will cause\r\nthe Zulus to take up arms against the English race, who wish to live at\r\npeace with them, not being ripe enough for civilization or civilized\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe standard rule that is gone by against the black races in this part\r\nof South Africa is the Amaxosa, or Cape Frontier Kafir, who is not to be\r\ncompared to the Zulu; nothing but forced Christianity or civilization\r\nwill spoil the Zulus, and the class of foreign missionaries we have in\r\nthe country does more injury than good to them. Let them say what they\r\nlike in their reports to the societies, they make no converts to their\r\nfaith, besides the pretended ones or vagabonds, who imagine that by\r\nbeing clothed and under the garb of Christianity they will be exempt\r\nfrom all king’s service and laws of the country, and be allowed to roam\r\nabout and do as they please.\r\n\r\nThe Zulu nation, judiciously dealt with, would remain a firm ally and\r\nfriend to the English, and it would be a shame for any false notions of\r\npower on the English side to take advantage of such power, and destroy\r\nthe Zulu race, which would undoubtedly be the case if they were\r\noverthrown; they would then become a lot of bold rogues, and eventually\r\ngive much trouble.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unfair features in the case is this, that the head of\r\nthe Transvaal government (Sir T. Shepstone) has always advised Cetywayo\r\nto remain quiet, and not to go to war with the Boers in disputing the\r\nboundary, promising him to see him righted, when, if it had been left to\r\nthe Zulus and Boers themselves, I am sure the Boers would have got the\r\nworst of it. He now turns round and is prepared to fight himself, when\r\nhe knows he is only too well backed up by England for the Dutch, England\r\nnot knowing the real facts.\r\n\r\nThe Zulus acknowledge no individual title to land, permission only being\r\ngiven to squat, the land being looked on as belonging to the squatter\r\nonly so long as he occupies it.\r\n\r\nBut before sending the above letter, I thought I would consult Mr. H.\r\nEscombe, and he advised me not to send the letter, as he had no doubt it\r\nwas the intention of the English government to disarm all the native\r\ntribes in South Africa, and that I would only be making a fool of\r\nmyself, or words to that effect, but at the same time advising me to\r\nwait the arrival of Mr. I. Sanderson, who was editor of the _Natal\r\nColonist_, a colonial newspaper, now defunct, and who was expected out\r\nfrom England shortly. I acted on Mr. Escombe’s advice, and on the\r\narrival of Mr. Sanderson had a conversation with him, and gave him the\r\nletter. He pretended to think well of my proposal, but before he had\r\ntime to carry it out, affairs, as regards Zulu matters, came to a\r\ncrisis, and Mr. Sanderson died shortly afterwards, and so ended this\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    APPENDIX TO GOLD FIELDS CHAPTER.\r\n\r\nThe following _resumé_ of the opinions of Dr. Schenk, a geologist who\r\nhas paid several professional visits and has lately made researches at\r\nthe gold fields, an account of which, I believe, he purposes shortly to\r\npublish in Germany, is taken from the letter of a correspondent in the\r\nPretoria _Volkstem_ under date February, 1887, and will be perused with\r\nconsiderable interest by geologists.\r\n\r\nThe Barberton formation, the doctor said, consisted of very old and in\r\nmost instances highly metamorphosed rocks, composed of slate and\r\nsandstone, with interposed eruptive rocks of greenstone (diorite,\r\nserpentine, etc.). These rocks are highly erected, dipping invariably at\r\ngreat angles, often perpendicular, and run from east to west. In this\r\nformation the gold-bearing veins or reefs are situated, and these with\r\nfew exceptions run in the same direction (this is, for instance, the\r\ncase with the reefs at Moodie’s and with the Sheba, etc.), nearly always\r\naccompanying the eruptive rocks. The gold, in the doctor’s opinion, came\r\nfrom the interior of the earth with the eruptive rocks to the surface,\r\nand was therefore concentrated in these reefs, which consist of quartz,\r\nand often contain iron along with the gold. This formation probably\r\ncorresponds in age with the Silurian formation of Europe, and is found\r\nalso in Swaziland, Zoutpansberg, and the recently discovered gold fields\r\nof the Tugela. There is no young formation overlying these rocks at\r\nBarberton, but in the Drakensberg and at Witwatersrand a younger\r\nformation lies unconformably over the older rocks. This the doctor\r\nconcluded to be of Devonian age. It consists of large beds of sandstone,\r\nwith here and there slate and greenstone. This younger formation had\r\nsubsequently been folded in the same way as the Barberton rocks, though\r\nnot so highly erected. The Barberton formation, he is inclined to think,\r\nproceeds beneath this formation in a westerly direction to Witwatersrand\r\nand thence to Bechuanaland. Regarding the presence of the\r\nbefore-mentioned younger formation, he considered it was due to the\r\noverflowing of this part of the country by the sea, which by wearing\r\naway the higher portions of the mountains, and destroying their rock,\r\nincluding the gold-bearing reefs, formed a more level plain and covered\r\nit with the destroyed masses of the old formation. This new formation,\r\ntherefore, was simply a re-deposit of the old one under a different\r\nappearance. The sandstone schists abounding at Witwatersrand were no\r\ndoubt formed of the softer rocks, while the conglomerate resulted from\r\nthe destruction of the hard reefs before alluded to; these probably\r\nhaving been reduced, by the action of the water, to sand and pebbles,\r\nwhich afterwards became cemented into a solid mass. The conglomerate of\r\nWitwatersrand, Dr. Schenk further observed, is imbedded in the\r\nsandstone, to form a series of large belts, the extremities of which are\r\nat the surface. His reasons for coming to this conclusion were that at\r\nWitwatersrand the conglomerate dipped to the south, while between\r\nHeidelberg and the Vaal (southward of the Rand) it dipped to the north,\r\nor in an exactly opposite direction, and between these places it lay\r\nmore horizontally, thus affording grounds for supposing that the\r\nconglomerate at one place is connected with that at the other. The\r\ndoctor, in conclusion, remarked that the Witwatersrand conglomerate was\r\na most peculiar formation, and that he had never before seen anything of\r\nthe kind. It did not, in his opinion, run into a reef, as many old\r\ndiggers and others seem to suppose; but the reefs from which it\r\noriginated, and which he judged to be the continuation of the Barberton\r\nreefs running through this place, he considers to be somewhere in the\r\nvicinity of the conglomerate, but at a considerable depth from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  A brandy of great strength, never matured, and frequently adulterated\r\n  with most noxious substances by unscrupulous canteen-keepers and\r\n  illicit liquor dealers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  “South African Mission Fields.”—Carlyle, Nesbet & Co. 1878.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  “Boers and Bantu.”—By George McCall Theal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  “Lives of R. and M.

W. R. Blackett, M. A., in relation to this, says: “This is a\r\n  remarkable _bouleversement_ of reasoning.

The particulars of the dispute, which for years\r\n  occupied the attention of the gentlemen of the long robe, are too long\r\n  and perplexing for me to enter into. Suffice it to say that, though\r\n  beyond all doubt both parties were convinced they had right on their\r\n  side, yet to lovers of the good old Church the dissensions were much\r\n  to be regretted. Bishop Colenso, however, in the long run gained the\r\n  day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  The Anglican Sisterhood of St. Michael and All Angels.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  Since enlarged.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Kafir pox, a varicelloid disease, believed to attack only natives,\r\n  also known as “Watcht en beitje” pock (Dutch, “wait a bit”), as it\r\n  delayed them on their road.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  An Act to legalize gambling by this means came before the legislative\r\n  council this year (1887) but was rejected. The arguments “for and\r\n  against” were very funny. One Dutch legislator, when the subject was\r\n  under debate, brought forward as a clinching argument that “when Jonah\r\n  was on board a vessel on his way to Nineveh it was decided by a\r\n  totalisator that he should be thrown overboard,” while another (who\r\n  had a large open Bible before him) referred to the Revelations, where,\r\n  he said, it was pointed out that “roovers, woekeraars, and spelers,”\r\n  could not enter the kingdom of heaven. He said God’s Holy Word did not\r\n  justify gambling, and where could they get a better authority than the\r\n  Bible? The name “totalisator” was in itself so big a word to pronounce\r\n  that he often wondered that people’s tongues did not twist in\r\n  pronouncing it (loud laughter).\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  It may be interesting to my readers to mention that “Vaal” means dun\r\n  or mud color, the tint of the river, especially noticeable during\r\n  flushes, when so much clay from the banks is held in suspension,\r\n  though at no period has the stream the crystal clearness of the Isis\r\n  or the Cam. The inhabitants of the banks are facetiously nicknamed\r\n  _Vaal penses_, in meaning much the same as “yellow bellies,” the\r\n  designation applied with rustic humor to the dwellers on the fens in\r\n  Lincolnshire by the agricultural population of the surrounding\r\n  districts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  August 1886.

One unfortunate native,\r\n  arrested for some trivial offense, when asked his name in the Charge\r\n  Office replied “Go to h——!” and gave the same when interrogated the\r\n  second time, on which the sergeant in charge knocked him down, but\r\n  regretted doing so when he found that that was really the name which\r\n  had been bestowed on him by his master. Only a few months since\r\n  another native arraigned gave his name as “B——y fool.” On being asked\r\n  by the magistrate who gave him that name, he replied that he chose it\r\n  himself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  Instead of “whims,” in which the horses trot round in a circle, some\r\n  of the diggers used “whips” in which the horses trot backward and\r\n  forward.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  Much of the debris of the early days pays handsomely to rewash with\r\n  the present improved machinery, and licenses authorizing such washing\r\n  are issued by the chief of the detective department.

Governor Southey in a long dispatch dated Kimberley, April\r\n  11th, 1874, in reply to a dispatch from Sir Henry Barkly of March\r\n  11th, the same year, and which was written after Langalibalele had\r\n  attempted to escape from Natal, said in clause\r\n\r\n  “15. The alterations and changes made by the Cape government, and with\r\n  which I am desired to co-operate, are made avowedly at the instance of\r\n  the Natal government; and you have furnished me with an extract from\r\n  one of that government’s communications upon the subject. I should\r\n  have been glad to have been permitted to peruse the whole of the\r\n  letter, as I have reason to believe that they attribute their late\r\n  troubles, in a large degree, to the facility with which natives can\r\n  obtain guns in this province, instead of, as in my opinion they should\r\n  do, attributing them to their own mismanagement and mistaken policy.\r\n\r\n  “16. It is not true that (as the colonial secretary of Natal\r\n  erroneously alleges) arms and ammunition at the diamond fields pass\r\n  more readily from the diggers to the natives than specie; the natives\r\n  receive their wages invariably in specie, they are paid weekly, and\r\n  the usual rate of pay is ten shillings for the week. Those who obtain\r\n  guns purchase them as a rule just before leaving for their homes, and\r\n  only after producing the permits to purchase which the law requires.\r\n  Comparatively speaking, but few Natal or Basuto natives come here; the\r\n  great bulk of our native laborers come from the interior northward of\r\n  the South African Republic, and considerably beyond the legitimate\r\n  boundaries of that state, and their guns are not acquired for war\r\n  purposes, but for purposes connected with legitimate and beneficial\r\n  trade.\r\n\r\n  “17. I cannot concur in the opinion of the lieutenant governor of\r\n  Natal that the acquisition of arms by the natives of the interior, who\r\n  come here and work in the mines, is fraught with danger to the peace\r\n  of South Africa, and I am unable to see why we should cherish a\r\n  friendly feeling with the neighboring republics any more than with the\r\n  various native tribes. I should consider it very undesirable to\r\n  purchase the friendly feeling of those republics at the expense of\r\n  injustice or oppression toward her Majesty’s own subjects or\r\n  unfriendly acts toward the aboriginal inhabitants of the country. I\r\n  may here state that the native tribes of the interior have ever\r\n  evinced the greatest possible friendliness toward us, and English\r\n  travelers, English traders and English missionaries have invariably\r\n  been received and treated with all respect by them, while on the other\r\n  hand the governments of the republics have on several occasions been\r\n  charged with unfriendliness toward us, in official documents addressed\r\n  to them by her Majesty’s representatives in South Africa. I believe we\r\n  shall best exhibit our friendliness toward the republics by setting\r\n  them an example of justice and toleration, and that we should act an\r\n  unfriendly part if we pandered to their prejudices or supported them\r\n  in oppressing the native population.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  I have even seen the rebels drilling in the market square with their\r\n  rifles, at four in the afternoon, ordered to “Right about face,”\r\n  “Present arms,” so that their rifles would point straight at the\r\n  government offices.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  I recollect at the time calling upon Mr. Froude, who was a _guest_ at\r\n  Government House.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Who at once ran away to escape the punishment he deserved.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  As far as Major Lanyon was personally concerned, future events proved\r\n  that it had not mattered to him whether the bill passed or not.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  See chapter 25.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  And, as my readers will have noticed, of the Griqualand West\r\n  legislative council as well.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  To Englishmen this act contained a curious clause. No person within\r\n  the province could sell or barter to any native (except under certain\r\n  provisos) any liquor of an intoxicating nature, and my readers can at\r\n  once realize the difficulty of logically reconciling the anomaly of\r\n  allowing a man a voice in the government of his country and precluding\r\n  him from the right of purchasing a glass of beer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  An expression applied to Griqualand West by the Hon.

This law, as the _Volkstem_ (the principal newspaper in\r\n  the Transvaal) says, is not only “ineffectual, but pernicious and\r\n  condemnable.” See copy of law in appendix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This is the motive generally attributed to the late Sir Pomeroy Colley\r\n  in making the ascent of Majuba during the absence of Sir Evelyn Wood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  In Great Britain the coal measures have an extent only of 11,859\r\n  square miles, in France of 1,719, and in Spain of 3,408.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  In July, 1886, the Kimberley papers gave publicity to a rumor that a\r\n  ring had been formed by the proprietors of collieries in England,\r\n  alarmed at the growth of the coal mining industry in Natal, to\r\n  undersell for an indefinite period, and by these means strangle\r\n  competition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  Majuba is 6,000 feet above the sea and 3,000 feet above Mount\r\n  Prospect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  Our total losses at Majuba were 6 officers killed, 9 wounded and 6\r\n  prisoners; non-commissioned officers and men, 86 killed, 125 wounded,\r\n  53 prisoners.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  The official reasons, or rather the official excuses, for the loss of\r\n  the day, are a transparent gloss, intended to hide gross mismanagement\r\n  on the one hand and a panic-stricken retreat on the other. They are\r\n  the following, extracted from the _Gazette_: (1) The slopes below the\r\n  brow of the plateau were too steep to be searched by our fire, and\r\n  cover existed up to the brow; (2) the rocky ridge we occupied in\r\n  second line, though the best we had time to hold, did not cover more\r\n  than fifty yards to its front, as the plateau rolled continuously to\r\n  the brow; (2a) the men were too exhausted to intrench, and hardly fit\r\n  to fight; (3) when the Boers gained the last ridge ours had to descend\r\n  almost impassable slopes, and many were shot in doing so.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  Boer commandment at Bronker’s Spruit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  Sixty-six officers and men killed sixty seven wounded, and nine\r\n  missing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Charles Garnett.—A Visit to the Leper Hospital of Bergen.—“Sunday\r\n  Magazine,” May 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  In the last session of the Natal legislative council the vote for\r\n  Langibalele’s support was reduced from £500 per annum to £50.

In the\r\n  appendix will be found a copy of the petition itself.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  The political resident at that period.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  A few months previously the Sprigg ministry had been defeated, session\r\n  of 1881.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Since the time I was in Basutoland Colonel Clark, who, during the\r\n  Transvaal war, after Captain Falls’ death, surrendered the court-house\r\n  at Potchefstroom, when it was set fire to by the Boers, has been\r\n  appointed agent in Basutoland. This imperial appointment was made\r\n  early in 1884 when the colonial government was relieved of its\r\n  responsibility in that country by the home government.\r\n\r\n  Since Colonel Clark has been in Basutoland the amount paid in taxes\r\n  has greatly increased, for whereas at first the receipts were at the\r\n  rate of £450 a year only, they now, Masupha having agreed also to pay\r\n  hut tax, exceed £5,000 per annum. But from the best authority I learn\r\n  that Colonel Clark’s power, although he is personally liked by the\r\n  Basutos, is merely nominal, and they would even now be too wide-awake\r\n  to pay taxes, if they were not afraid of the confiscation, or in other\r\n  words of the robbery, of their cattle by their chiefs, and if they did\r\n  not fear the personal vengeance which would result on their resisting;\r\n  they prefer, therefore, to buy the semblance of British authority at\r\n  the rate of £1 a year per hut, rather than have their cattle stolen\r\n  without any redress whatever.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  The average Sunday attendance at St. Cyprian’s is now 500 at morning\r\n  and 700 at evening service; the congregation having more than doubled\r\n  within the last five years, though the population of Kimberley has\r\n  certainly diminished. This fact must be subject of great gratification\r\n  to the clergy of this church. The new church at Beaconsfield (Du\r\n  Toit’s Pan), named All Saints, is a very handsome stone and brick\r\n  structure, and the lately consecrated bishop laid the foundation stone\r\n  of a new church (St. Alban’s) at De Beer’s, about the end of September\r\n  1883. There is also a small church (St. Augustine’s) situated at the\r\n  west end of Kimberley, the present incumbent of which is the Hon. and\r\n  Rev. Mr. Lyttleton.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  A magnificent monument to the late Mr. Ornstein, subscribed to by\r\n  members of all denominations on the Diamond Fields, was consecrated in\r\n  October, 1886.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  The South African native has no religion, worships no God, and his\r\n  only idea of spiritual life is that his soul, when he dies, takes up\r\n  its abode in a snake, and that the spirits of his ancestors have the\r\n  power of working good or evil, or of causing sickness and death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  A fractured diamond.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  This gentleman’s forte was Roman Dutch law. During his residence on\r\n  the Diamond Fields he acquired the soubriquet of “Emphytensis” in\r\n  consequence of his efforts to establish the practical identity of a\r\n  certain Roman leasehold tenure of that name, and the quit-tenure of\r\n  the Cape Colony, thus attempting to establish the rights of the Crown\r\n  to all diamond and precious stones. His endeavors were, however,\r\n  without avail, and he was laughed at for his pains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  A noted hostelry near the court-house.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  This is exemplified in the names by which white people of any\r\n  importance are known among them. For instance, a pompous friend of\r\n  mine, now an important government official in Natal, was known by the\r\n  natives as “Totovian” (Intotoviane) after a most offensively\r\n  odoriferous grasshopper with which he waged incessant war. But the\r\n  most biting example of native sarcasm, I think, consisted in the name\r\n  applied by them to a florin (2s. piece) that of “Scotchman.” This\r\n  conveyed, in one word, their appreciation of the Scotch cheese-paring\r\n  tendency; as they were shrewd enough to observe, that in cases where\r\n  an Englishman would give half a crown, his Highland neighbor would\r\n  give only two shillings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  Shakespere.—Henry VI., Part ii., Act iv., Scene 2.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  This class of scoundrel gave Christiana the fictitious appearance of a\r\n  population, but this is more fully explained in the chapter on Diamond\r\n  Legislation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  _I.e._, thirty-six miles, for so are distances reckoned in South\r\n  Africa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  These I describe in the account of another journey to the Transvaal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  This beautiful building has since been completed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Literally, a dram of liquor—meaning a trifle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  In pondering over the state of matters then existing it was impossible\r\n  for me not to picture in my mind the change time had wrought! A few\r\n  short years before, I had seen and listened to Thomas Francois\r\n  Burgers, full of eager anticipation of the future before him, speak\r\n  most hopefully of the Transvaal, at a banquet given in his honor at\r\n  Kimberley, as he passed through to assume the “dictatorship” of that\r\n  republic. And when, in touching upon some observation I had made in\r\n  proposing the toast of “the press,” he had emphasized the fact that\r\n  “the pen was mightier than the sword.” And now, his expectations\r\n  unrealized, his fond hopes withered, his ambition blighted,\r\n  broken-down in health and spirits, it was not to be wondered at that\r\n  he made no strenuous opposition to the advent of British rule.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  Sir Theophilus Shepstone arrived in Pretoria with his twenty-five\r\n  policemen in January, 1877. He announced to President Burgers that\r\n  unless he could make arrangements that would be satisfactory to the\r\n  Imperial government with regard to the government of the Transvaal he\r\n  was authorized to annex it as a portion of Her Majesty’s dominions.\r\n  President Burgers called a special session of the Volksraad, and\r\n  proposed a new constitution, but that did not meet with the approval\r\n  of the British Commissioner, and on the 12th of April, 1877, as I have\r\n  mentioned before, the country was proclaimed British territory, and\r\n  Sir T. Shepstone assumed the administration of affairs. He continued\r\n  to hold that position until the 18th of December, 1878, when he left\r\n  for Zululand in consequence of the threatening aspect of native\r\n  affairs there. The government was administered for a time by the\r\n  senior military officer before the arrival of Colonel Lanyon. Sir T.\r\n  Shepstone never returned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Christian Maasdorp, now nominated to a seat on the Eastern\r\n  District’s bench, but who then held the commission as Attorney\r\n  General, resigned “when he found it impossible (vide Transvaal\r\n  _Advertiser_, November 20th, 1885) to countenance the chicane and\r\n  tyranny of the Lanyon administration.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  Sir Garnet Wolseley was assisted by an executive council consisting of\r\n  Colonel Lanyon, administrator, Colonel Harrison, commanding H. M.\r\n  troops, Mr. Melmoth Osborne, Colonial Secretary, Mr. C. G. Maasdorp,\r\n  Attorney General, and Mr. H. C. Shepstone, Secretary for native\r\n  affairs. There were also three non-official members, viz., Messrs. J.\r\n  Marais, J. C. Holtshausen, and J. S. Joubert, who with the members of\r\n  the government composed the Executive Council under the Constitution\r\n  promulgated on November 8th, 1879. A legislative assembly was at the\r\n  same time called into being by the Wolseley constitution, and the\r\n  under-mentioned gentlemen were nominated: viz., Messrs. J. R. White,\r\n  O. W. A. Forsman, J. A. Esterhuizen, A. H. Stander and J. H. Nel. The\r\n  last session of the legislative assembly concluded very shortly before\r\n  the war broke out, which put an end to the constitution and British\r\n  authority at one fell swoop.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  “To our homes.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  _Convention of Pretoria_, Article 23: If not released before the\r\n  taking effect of this Convention, Sekukuni, and those of his followers\r\n  who have been imprisoned with him, will be forthwith released, and the\r\n  boundaries of his location will be defined by the Native Location\r\n  Commission in the manner indicated in the last preceding article.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  The first Sekukuni war broke out in October, 1876, the treaty of peace\r\n  being signed February 5th, 1877.

Wolseley) of the tribe, and the capture of\r\n  the chief, who was held a prisoner of war, as I have mentioned, until\r\n  the convention of Pretoria was signed in August, 1881. The Mapoch\r\n  (Niabel) and Mampoer war commenced near the end of 1882 and was about\r\n  ten months in duration. Mapoch surrendered 12th of July, 1883, to\r\n  General Joubert, who had conducted the operations against both chiefs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  The Government is wakening to this fact and is beginning to take\r\n  active measures.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  I regret to learn that this gentleman, who was much esteemed in\r\n  Barberton, is recently dead.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  One of the latest analyses gives Welsh coal 81.0 carbon, 6.40 ash;\r\n  Transvaal 77.20 carbon, 7.20 ash.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  The truth of my prognostications has, I am sorry to say, become to a\r\n  certain extent verified even before my ink is dry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  In the appointment of a British Resident care will have to be\r\n  exercised that no one interested in the gold speculations of the\r\n  country be nominated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  The census returns of the entire population in 1864, twenty-three\r\n  years ago, was 1098.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  In the concession granted in 1873 to Moodie for a railway from Delagoa\r\n  Bay to Pretoria, a grant also was made him of 850 farms of 6,000 acres\r\n  each, in case he should be successful. Curiously enough these were the\r\n  very farms on which the present Kaap gold fields are situated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  This was brought forward very prominently in the report of the select\r\n  committee on Railway to Delagoa Bay, appointed by resolution of the\r\n  House of Assembly, 5th of April, 1880, C. K. White, chairman.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Cape Brandy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  Chief detective officer at the South African Diamond Fields.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
