The 140 year old binding\r\nhad disintegrated, but the paper and printing was in amazingly good\r\ncondition, particularly the multicolor images.\r\n\r\nThanks also to the Mayo Clinic. This book has increased my appreciation\r\nof their skilled care of my case by showing the many ways that things\r\ncould go wrong.\r\n\r\nFootnotes are indicated by \"[Footnote]\" where they appear in the text.\r\nThe body of the footnote appears immediately following the complete\r\nparagraph. If more than one footnote appears in the same paragraph, they\r\nare numbered.\r\n\r\nA few obvious misspellings have been corrected. Several cases of\r\nalternate spelling of the same(?) word have not been modified.\r\n\r\nPages have been reorganized to avoid splitting sentences and paragraphs.\r\nEach image is inserted immediately following its description.\r\n\r\nSome of the plates did not fit on the scanner and were captured as two\r\nseparate images. The merged images show some artifacts of the merge\r\nprocess due to slightly different lighting of the page. The contrast and\r\ngamma values have been adjusted to restore the images.\r\n\r\nHere are the definitions of some words used in the text. Medical terms\r\nare defined only relating to humans.

Whatever title may most fittingly apply to a work with this\r\nintent, whether it had better be styled surgical or medical, regional,\r\nrelative, descriptive, or topographical anatomy, will matter little,\r\nprovided its more salient or prominent character be manifested in its\r\nown form and feature. The work, as I have designed it, will itself show\r\nthat my intent has been to base the practical upon the anatomical, and\r\nto unite these wherever a mutual dependence was apparent.\r\n\r\nThat department of anatomical research to which the name topographical\r\nstrictly applies, as confining itself to the mere account of the form\r\nand relative location of the several organs comprising the animal body,\r\nis almost wholly isolated from the main questions of physiological and\r\ntranscendental interest, and cannot, therefore, be supposed to speak in\r\nthose comprehensive views which anatomy, taken in its widest\r\nsignification as a science, necessarily includes. While the anatomist\r\ncontents himself with describing the form and position of organs as they\r\nappear exposed, layer after layer, by his dissecting instruments, he\r\ndoes not pretend to soar any higher in the region of science than the\r\nhumble level of other mechanical arts, which merely appreciate the\r\nfitting arrangement of things relative to one another, and combinative\r\nto the whole design of the form or machine of whatever species this may\r\nbe, whether organic or inorganic. The descriptive anatomist of the human\r\nbody aims at no higher walk in science than this, and hence his\r\nnomenclature is, as it is, a barbarous jargon of words, barren of all\r\ntruthful signification, inconsonant with nature, and blindly\r\nirrespective of the cognitio certa ex principiis certis exorta.\r\n\r\nStill, however, this anatomy of form, although so much requiring\r\npurification of its nomenclature, in order to clothe it in the high\r\nreaching dignity of a science, does not disturb the medical or surgical\r\npractitioner, so far as their wants are concerned. Although it may, and\r\nactually does, trammel the votary who aspires to the higher\r\ngeneralizations and the development of a law of formation, yet, as this\r\nis not the object of the surgical anatomist, the nomenclature, such as\r\nit is, will answer conveniently enough the present purpose.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the human form, contemplated in reference to that of all\r\nother species of animals to which it bears comparison, constitutes the\r\nstudy of the comparative anatomist, and, as such, establishes the\r\nscience in its full intent. But the anatomy of the human figure,\r\nconsidered as a species, per se, is confessedly the humblest walk of the\r\nunderstanding in a subject which, as anatomy, is relationary, and\r\nbranches far and wide through all the domain of an animal kingdom. While\r\nrestricted to the study of the isolated human species, the cramped\r\njudgment wastes in such narrow confine; whereas, in the expansive gaze\r\nover all allying and allied species, the intellect bodies forth to its\r\nvision the full appointed form of natural majesty; and after having\r\nexperienced the manifold analogies and differentials of the many, is\r\nthereby enabled, when it returns to the study of the one, to view this\r\none of human type under manifold points of interest, to the appreciation\r\nof which the understanding never wakens otherwise. If it did not happen\r\nthat the study of the human form (confined to itself) had some practical\r\nbearing, such study could not deserve the name of anatomical, while\r\nanatomical means comparative, and whilst comparison implies inductive\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nHowever, practical anatomy, such as it is, is concerned with an exact\r\nknowledge of the relationship of organs as they stand in reference to\r\neach other, and to the whole design of which these organs are the\r\nintegral parts. The figure, the capacity, and the contents of the\r\nthoracic and abdominal cavities, become a study of not more urgent\r\nconcernment to the physician, than are the regions named cervical,\r\naxillary, inguinal, &c., to the surgeon. He who would combine both modes\r\nof a relationary practice, such as that of medicine and surgery, should\r\nbe well acquainted with the form and structures characteristic of all\r\nregions of the human body; and it may be doubted whether he who pursues\r\neither mode of practice, wholly exclusive of the other, can do so with\r\nhonest purpose and large range of understanding, if he be not equally\r\nwell acquainted with the subject matter of both. It is, in fact, more\r\ntriflingly fashionable than soundly reasonable, to seek to define the\r\nline of demarcation between the special callings of medicine and\r\nsurgery, for it will ever be as vain an endeavour to separate the one\r\nfrom the other without extinguishing the vitality of both, as it would\r\nbe to sunder the trunk from the head, and give to each a separate living\r\nexistence. The necessary division of labour is the only reason that can\r\nbe advanced in excuse of specialisms; but it will be readily agreed to,\r\nthat that practitioner who has first laid within himself the foundation\r\nof a general knowledge of matters relationary to his subject, will\r\nalways be found to pursue the speciality according to the light of\r\nreason and science.\r\n\r\nAnatomy--the [Greek words], the knowledge based on principle--is the\r\nfoundation of the curative art, cultivated as a science in all its\r\nbranchings; and comparison is the nurse of reason, which we are fain to\r\nmake our guide in bringing the practical to bear productively. The human\r\nbody, in a state of health, is the standard whereunto we compare the\r\nsame body in a state of disease. The knowledge of the latter can only\r\nexist by the knowledge of the former, and by the comparison of both.\r\n\r\nComparison may be fairly termed the pioneer to all certain knowledge. It\r\nis a potent instrument--the only one, in the hands of the pathologist,\r\nas well as in those of the philosophic generalizer of anatomical facts,\r\ngathered through the extended survey of an animal kingdom. We best\r\nrecognise the condition of a dislocated joint after we have become well\r\nacquainted with the contour of its normal state; all abnormal conditions\r\nare best understood by a knowledge of what we know to be normal\r\ncharacter. Every anatomist is a comparer, in a greater or lesser degree;\r\nand he is the greatest anatomist who compares the most generally.\r\n\r\nImpressed with this belief, I have laid particular emphasis on imitating\r\nthe character of the normal form of the human figure, taken as a whole;\r\nthat of its several regions as parts of this whole, and that of the\r\nvarious organs (contained within those regions) as its integrals or\r\nelements. And in order to present this subject of relative anatomy in\r\nmore vivid reality to the understanding of the student, I have chosen\r\nthe medium of illustrating by figure rather than by that of written\r\nlanguage, which latter, taken alone, is almost impotent in a study of\r\nthis nature.\r\n\r\nIt is wholly impossible for anyone to describe form in words without the\r\naid of figures. Even the mathematical strength of Euclid would avail\r\nnothing, if shorn of his diagrams. The professorial robe is impotent\r\nwithout its diagrams. Anatomy being a science existing by demonstration,\r\n(for as much as form in its actuality is the language of nature,) must\r\nbe discoursed of by the instrumentality of figure.\r\n\r\nAn anatomical illustration enters the understanding straight-forward in\r\na direct passage, and is almost independent of the aid of written\r\nlanguage. A picture of form is a proposition which solves itself. It is\r\nan axiom encompassed in a frame-work of self-evident truth. The best\r\nsubstitute for Nature herself, upon which to teach the knowledge of her,\r\nis an exact representation of her form.\r\n\r\nEvery surgical anatomist will (if he examine himself) perceive that,\r\npreviously to undertaking the performance of an operation upon the\r\nliving body, he stands reassured and self-reliant in that degree in\r\nwhich he is capable of conjuring up before his mental vision a distinct\r\npicture of his subject. Mr. Liston could draw the same anatomical\r\npicture mentally which Sir Charles Bell's handicraft could draw in\r\nreality of form and figure. Scarpa was his own draughtsman.\r\n\r\nIf there may be any novelty now-a-days possible to be recognised upon\r\nthe out-trodden track of human relative anatomy, it can only be in\r\ntruthful and well-planned illustration. Under this view alone may the\r\nanatomist plead an excuse for reiterating a theme which the beautiful\r\nworks of Cowper, Haller, Hunter, Scarpa, Soemmering, and others, have\r\ndealt out so respectably. Except the human anatomist turns now to what\r\nhe terms the practical ends of his study, and marshals his little\r\nknowledge to bear upon those ends, one may proclaim anthropotomy to have\r\nworn itself out. Dissection can do no more, except to repeat\r\nCruveilhier. And that which Cruveilhier has done for human anatomy,\r\nMuller has completed for the physiological interpretation of human\r\nanatomy; Burdach has philosophised, and Magendie has experimented to the\r\nfull upon this theme, so far as it would permit. All have pushed the\r\nsubject to its furthest limits, in one aspect of view. The narrow circle\r\nis footworn. All the needful facts are long since gathered, sown, and\r\nknown. We have been seekers after those facts from the days of\r\nAristotle. Are we to put off the day of attempting interpretation for\r\nthree thousand years more, to allow the human physiologist time to slice\r\nthe brain into more delicate atoms than he has done hitherto, in order\r\nto coin more names, and swell the dictionary? No! The work must now be\r\nretrospective, if we would render true knowledge progressive. It is not\r\na list of new and disjointed facts that Science at present thirsts for;\r\nbut she is impressed with the conviction that her wants can alone be\r\nsupplied by the creation of a new and truthful theory,--a generalization\r\nwhich the facts already known are sufficient to supply, if they were\r\nwell ordered according to their natural relationship and mutual\r\ndependence. \"Le temps viendra peut-etre,\" says Fontenelle, \"que l'on\r\njoindra en un corps regulier ces membres epars; et, s'ils sont tels\r\nqu'on le souhaite, ils s'assembleront en quelque sorte d'eux-memes.\r\nPlusieurs verites separees, des qu'elles sont en assez grand nombre,\r\noffrent si vivement a l'esprit leurs rapports et leur mutuelle\r\ndependance, qu'il semble qu'apres les avoir detachees par une espece de\r\nviolence les unes des autres, elles cherchent naturellement a se\r\nreunir.\"--(Preface sur l'utilite des Sciences, &c.)\r\n\r\nThe comparison of facts already known must henceforward be the scalpel\r\nwhich we are to take in hand. We must return by the same road on which\r\nwe set out, and reexamine the things and phenomena which, as novices, we\r\npassed by too lightly. The travelled experience may now sit down and\r\ncontemplate.\r\n\r\nThat which I have said and proved elsewhere in respect to the skeleton\r\nsystem may, with equal truth, be remarked of the nervous system--namely,\r\nthat the question is not in how far does the limit of diversity extend\r\nthrough the condition of an evidently common analogy, but by what rule\r\nor law the uniform ens is rendered the diverse entity? The womb of\r\nanatomical science is pregnant of the true interpretation of the law of\r\nunity in variety; but the question is of longer duration than was the\r\nlife of the progenitor. Though Aristotle and Linnaeus, and Buffon and\r\nCuvier, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Leibnitz, and Gothe, have lived and\r\nspoken, yet the present state of knowledge proclaims the Newton of\r\nphysiology to be as yet unborn. The iron scalpel has already made\r\nacquaintance with not only the greater parts, but even with the\r\ninfinitesimals of the human body; and reason, confined to this narrow\r\nrange of a subject, perceives herself to be imprisoned, and quenches her\r\nguiding light in despair. Originality has outlived itself; and discovery\r\nis a long-forgotten enterprise, except as pursued in the microcosm on\r\nthe field of the microscope, which, it must be confessed, has drawn\r\nforth demonstrations only commensurate in importance with the magnitude\r\nof the littleness there seen.\r\n\r\nThe subject of our study, whichever it happen to be, may appear\r\nexhausted of all interest, and the promise of valuable novelty, owing to\r\ntwo reasons:--It may be, like descriptive human anatomy, so cold, poor\r\nand sterile in its own nature, and so barren of product, that it will be\r\nimpossible for even the genius of Promethean fire to warm it; or else,\r\nlike existing physiology, the very point of view from which the mental\r\neye surveys the theme, will blight the fair prospect of truth, distort\r\ninduction, and clog up the paces of ratiocination. The physiologist of\r\nthe present day is too little of a comparative anatomist, and far too\r\nclosely enveloped in the absurd jargon of the anthropotomist, ever to\r\nhope to reveal any great truth for science, and dispel the mists which\r\nstill hang over the phenomena of the nervous system. He is steeped too\r\ndeeply in the base nomenclature of the antique school, and too indolent\r\nto question the import of Pons, Commissure, Island, Taenia, Nates,\r\nTestes, Cornu, Hippocamp, Thalamus, Vermes, Arbor Vitro, Respiratory\r\nTract, Ganglia of Increase, and all such phrase of unmeaning sound, ever\r\nto be productive of lucid interpretation of the cerebro-spinal ens.\r\nCustom alone sanctions his use of such names; but\r\n\r\n  \"Custom calls him to it!\r\n  What custom wills; should custom always do it,\r\n  The dust on antique time would lie unswept,\r\n  And mountainous error be too highly heaped,\r\n  For truth to overpeer.\"\r\n\r\nOf the illustrations of this work I may state, in guarantee of their\r\nanatomical accuracy, that they have been made by myself from my own\r\ndissections, first planned at the London University College, and\r\nafterwards realised at the Ecole Pratique, and School of Anatomy\r\nadjoining the Hospital La Pitie, Paris, a few years since. As far as the\r\nsubject of relative anatomy could admit of novel treatment, rigidly\r\nconfined to facts unalterable, I have endeavoured to give it.\r\n\r\nThe unbroken surface of the human figure is as a map to the surgeon,\r\nexplanatory of the anatomy arranged beneath; and I have therefore left\r\nappended to the dissected regions as much of the undissected as was\r\nnecessary. My object was to indicate the interior through the\r\nsuperficies, and thereby illustrate the whole living body which concerns\r\nsurgery, through its dissected dead counterfeit. We dissect the dead\r\nanimal body in order to furnish the memory with as clear an account of\r\nthe structure contained in its living representative, which we are not\r\nallowed to analyse, as if this latter were perfectly translucent, and\r\ndirectly demonstrative of its component parts.\r\n\r\nJ.

Every space is occupied by its contents. The\r\nthoracic space is completely filled by its viscera, which, in mass, take\r\na perfect cast or model of its interior. The thoracic viscera lie so\r\nclosely to one another, that they respectively influence the form and\r\ndimensions of each other. That space which the lungs do not occupy is\r\nfilled by the heart, &c., and vice versa. The thoracic apparatus causes\r\nno vacuum by the acts of either contraction or dilatation. Neither do\r\nthe lungs or the heart. When any organ, by its process of growth, or by\r\nits own functional act, forces a space for itself, it immediately\r\ninhabits that space entirely at the expense of neighbouring organs. When\r\nthe heart dilates, the pulmonary space contracts; and when the thoracic\r\nspace increases, general space diminishes in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the functions of respiration and circulation consists,\r\nduring the life of the animal, in a constant oscillatory nisus to\r\nproduce a vacuum which it never establishes. These vital forces of the\r\nrespiratory and circulatory organs, so characteristic of the higher\r\nclasses of animals, are opposed to the general forces of surrounding\r\nnature. The former vainly strive to make exception to the irrevocable\r\nlaw, that \"nature abhors a vacuum.\" This act of opposition between both\r\nforces constitutes the respiratory act, and thus the respiratory\r\nthoracic being (like a vibrating pendulum) manifests respiratory motion,\r\nnot as an effort of volition originating solely with itself, but\r\naccording to the measure of the force of either law; as entity is\r\nrelationary, so is functionality likewise. The being is functional by\r\nrelationship; and just as a pendulum is functional, by reason of the\r\ncounteraction of two opposing forces,--viz., the force of motion and the\r\nforce of gravity,--so is a thoracic cavity (considering it as a\r\nmechanical apparatus) functional by two opposing forces--the vital force\r\nand the surrounding physical force. The inspiration of thoracic space is\r\nthe expiration of general space, and reciprocally.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic space is a symmetrical enclosure originally, which\r\naftercoming necessities modify and distort in some degree. The spaces\r\noccupied by the opposite lungs in the adult body do not exactly\r\ncorrespond as to capacity, O O, Plate 1. Neither is the cardiac space, A\r\nE G D, Plate 1, which is traversed by the common median line,\r\nsymmetrical. The asymmetry of the lungs is mainly owing to the form and\r\nposition of the heart; for this organ inclines towards the left thoracic\r\nside. The left lung is less in capacity than the right, by so much space\r\nas the heart occupies in the left pulmonary side. The general form of\r\nthe thorax is that of a cone, I I N N, Plate 1, bicleft through its\r\nperpendicular axis, H M. The line of bicleavage is exactly median, and\r\npasses through the centre of the sternum in front, and the centres of\r\nthe dorsal vertebral behind. Between the dorsal vertebral and the\r\nsternum, the line of median cleavage is maintained and sketched out in\r\nmembrane. This membranous middle is formed by the adjacent sides of the\r\nopposite pleural or enveloping bags in which the lungs are enclosed. The\r\nheart, A, Plate 1, is developed between these two pleural sacs, F F, and\r\nseparates them from each other to a distance corresponding to its own\r\nsize. The adjacent sides of the two pleural sacs are central to the\r\nthorax, and form that space which is called mediastinum; the heart is\r\nlocated in this mediastinum, U E, Plate 1. The extent of the thoracic\r\nregion ranges perpendicularly from the root of the neck, Q, Plate 1, to\r\nthe roof of the abdomen--viz., the diaphragm, P, transversely from the\r\nribs of one side, I N, Plate 1, to those of the other, and\r\nantero-posteriorly from the sternum, H M, to the vertebral column. All\r\nthis space is pulmonary, except the cardiac or median space, which, in\r\naddition to the heart, A, Plate 1, and great bloodvessels, G C B,\r\ncontains the oesophagus, bronchi, &c. The ribs are the true enclosures\r\nof thoracic space, and, generally, in mammalian forms, they fail or\r\ndegenerate at that region of the trunk which is not pulmonary or\r\nrespiratory. In human anatomy, a teleological reason is given for\r\nthis--namely, that of the ribs being mechanically subservient to the\r\nfunction of respiration alone. But the transcendental anatomists\r\ninterpret this fact otherwise, and refer it to the operation of a higher\r\nlaw of formation.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the thorax is influenced by the capacity of the abdomen\r\nand its contents. In order to admit of full inspiration and pulmonary\r\nexpansion, the abdominal viscera recede in the same ratio as the lungs\r\ndilate. The diaphragm, P P, Plate 1, or transverse musculo-membranous\r\npartition which divides the pulmonary and alimentary cavities, is, by\r\nvirtue of its situation, as mechanically subservient to the abdomen as\r\nto the thorax. And under general notice, it will appear that even the\r\nabdominal muscles are as directly related to the respiratory act as\r\nthose of the thorax. The connexion between functions is as intimate and\r\nindissoluble as the connexion between organs in the same body. There can\r\nbe no more striking proof of the divinity of design than by such\r\nrevelations as anatomical science everywhere manifests in facts such as\r\nthis--viz., that each organ serves in most cases a double, and in many a\r\ntriple purpose, in the animal economy.\r\n\r\nThe apex of the lung projects into the root of the neck, even to a\r\nhigher level, Q, Plate 1, than that occupied by the sternal end of the\r\nclavicle, K. If the point of a sword were pushed through the neck above\r\nthe clavicle, at K, Plate 1, it would penetrate the apex of the right\r\nlung, where the subclavian artery, Q, Plate 1, arches over it. In\r\nconnexion with this fact, I may mention it as very probable that the\r\nbruit, or continuous murmur which we hear through the stethoscope, in\r\nchlorotic females, is caused by the pulsation of the subclavian artery\r\nagainst the top of the lung. The stays or girdle which braces the loins\r\nof most women prevents the expansion of the thoracic apparatus,\r\nnaturally attained by the descent of the diaphragm; and hence, no doubt,\r\nthe lung will distend inordinately above towards the neck. It is an\r\ninteresting fact for those anatomists who study the higher\r\ngeneralizations of their science, that at those very localities--viz.,\r\nthe neck and loins, where the lungs by their own natural effort are\r\nprone to extend themselves in forced inspiration--happen the \"anomalous\"\r\ncreations of cervical and lumbar ribs. The subclavian artery is\r\noccasionally complicated by the presence of these costal appendages.\r\n\r\nIf the body be transfixed through any one of the intercostal spaces, the\r\ninstrument will surely wound some part of the lung. If the thorax be\r\npierced from any point whatever, provided the instrument be directed\r\ntowards a common centre, A, Plate 1, the lung will suffer lesion; for\r\nthe heart is, almost completely, in the healthy living body, enveloped\r\nin the lungs. So true is it that all the costal region (the asternal as\r\nwell as the sternal) is a pulmonary enclosure, that any instrument which\r\npierces intercostal space must wound the lung.\r\n\r\nAs the sternal ribs degenerate into the \"false\" asternal or incomplete\r\nribs from before, obliquely backward down to the last dorsal vertebra,\r\nso the thoracic space takes form. The lungs range through a much larger\r\nspace, therefore, posteriorly than they do anteriorly.\r\n\r\nThe form of the thorax, in relation to that of the abdomen, may be\r\nlearned from the fact that a gunshot, which shall enter a little below\r\nN, Plate 1, and, after traversing the body transversely, shall pass out\r\nat a corresponding point at the opposite side, would open the thorax and\r\nthe abdomen into a common cavity; for it would pierce the thorax at N,\r\nthe arching diaphragm at the level of M, and thereat enter the belly;\r\nthen it would enter the thorax again at P, and make exit below N,\r\nopposite. If a cutting instrument were passed horizontally from before\r\nbackward, a little below M, it would first open the abdomen, then pierce\r\nthe arching diaphragm, and pass into the thorax, opposite the ninth or\r\neighth dorsal vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe outward form or superficies masks in some degree the form of the\r\ninterior. The width of the thorax above does not exceed the diameter\r\nbetween the points I I, of Plate 1, or the points W W, of Plate 2. If we\r\nmake percussion directly from before backwards at any place external to\r\nI, Plate 1, we do not render the lung vibrative. The diameters between I\r\nI and N N, Plate 1, are not equal; and these measures will indicate the\r\nform of the thorax in the living body, between the shoulders above and\r\nthe loins below.\r\n\r\nThe position of the heart in the thorax varies somewhat with several\r\nbodies. The size of the heart, even in a state of perfect health, varies\r\nalso in subjects of corresponding ages, a condition which is often\r\nmistaken for pathological. For the most part, its form occupies a space\r\nranging from two or three lines right of the right side of the sternum\r\nto the middle of the shafts of the fifth and sixth ribs of the left\r\nside. In general, the length of the osseous sternum gives the exact\r\nperpendicular range of the heart, together with its great vessels.\r\n\r\nThe aorta, C, Plates 1 and 2, is behind the upper half of the sternum,\r\nfrom which it is separated by the pericardium, D, Plate 1, the thin edge\r\nof the lung, and the mediastinal pleurae, U E, Plate 1, &c. If the heart\r\nbe injected from the abdominal aorta, the aortal arch will flatten\r\nagainst the sternum. Pulmonary space would not be opened by a\r\npenetrating instrument passed into the root of the neck in the median\r\nline above the sternum, at L, Plate 1. But the apices of both lungs\r\nwould be wounded if the same instrument entered deeply on either side of\r\nthis median line at K K. An instrument which would pierce the sternum\r\nopposite the insertion of the second, third, or fourth costal cartilage,\r\nfrom H downwards, would transfix some part of the arch of the aorta, C,\r\nPlate 1. The same instrument, if pushed horizontally backward through\r\nthe second, third, or fourth interspaces of the costal cartilages close\r\nto the sternum, would wound, on the right of the sternal line, the vena\r\ncava superior, G, Plate 1; on the left, the pulmonary artery, B, and\r\nthe descending thoracic aorta. In the healthy living body, the thoracic\r\nsounds heard in percussion, or by means of the stethoscope, will vary\r\naccording to the locality operated upon, in consequence of the variable\r\nthickness of those structures (muscular and osseous, &c.,) which invest\r\nthe thoracic walls. Uniformity of sound must, owing to these facts, be\r\nas materially interrupted, as it certainly is, in consequence of the\r\nvariable contents of the cavity. The variability of the healthy thoracic\r\nsounds will, therefore, be too often likely to be mistaken for that of\r\ndisease, if we forget to admit these facts, as instanced in the former\r\nstate. Considering the form of the thoracic space in reference to the\r\ngeneral form of the trunk of the living body, I see reason to doubt\r\nwhether the practitioner can by any boasted delicacy of manipulation,\r\ndetect an abnormal state of the pulmonary organs by percussion, or the\r\nuse of the stethoscope, applied at those regions which he terms\r\ncoracoid, scapulary, subclavian, &c., if the line of his examination be\r\ndirected from before backwards. The scapula, covered by thick carneous\r\nmasses, does not lie in the living body directly upon the\r\nosseous-thorax, neither does the clavicle. As all antero-posterior\r\nexamination in reference to the lungs external to the points, I I,\r\nbetween the shoulders cannot, in fact, concern the pulmonary organs, so\r\nit cannot be diagnostic of their state either in health or disease. The\r\ndifficulties which oppose the practitioner's examination of the state of\r\nthe thoracic contents are already numerous enough, independent of those\r\nwhich may arise from unanatomical investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 1 & 2.\r\n\r\nPLATE 1.\r\n\r\nA.

The sides of this square are formed anteriorly by the line\r\nranging from the mental symphysis to the top of the sternum, and\r\nposteriorly by a line drawn between the occiput and shoulder. The\r\nsuperior side of this cervical square is drawn by the horizontal ramus\r\nof the lower maxilla, and the inferior side by the horizontal line of\r\nthe clavicle. This square space, R 16, 8, 6, Plate 4, is halved by a\r\ndiagonal line, drawn by the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle B, which cuts\r\nthe square into two triangles. In the anterior triangle, F 16, 6, Plate\r\n4, is located the superficial common carotid artery, C, and its\r\nbranches, D, with accompanying nerves. In the posterior triangle, 9, 8,\r\n6, Plate 4, is placed the superficial subclavian artery, A, its\r\nbranches, L M, and the brachial plexus of nerves, I. Both these\r\ntriangles and their contents are completely sheathed by that thin\r\nscarf-like muscle, named platysma myoides, A A, Plate 3, the fibres of\r\nwhich traverse the neck slantingly in a line, O A, of diagonal direction\r\nopposite to and secant of that of the sterno-mastoid muscle.\r\n\r\nWhen the skin and subcutaneous adipose membrane are removed by careful\r\ndissection from the cervical region, certain structures are exposed,\r\nwhich, even in the undissected neck, projected on the superficies, and\r\nare the unerring guides to the localities of the blood-vessels and\r\nnerves, &c. In Plate 4, the top of the sternum, 6; the clavicle, 7; the\r\n\"Pomum Adami,\" 1; the lower maxilla at V; the hyoid bone, Z; the\r\nsterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, B; and the clavicular portion of the\r\ntrapezius muscle, 8; will readily be felt or otherwise recognised\r\nthrough the skin, &c. When these several points are well considered in\r\ntheir relation to one another, they will correctly determine the\r\nrelative locality of those structures--the blood-vessels, nerves, &c.,\r\nwhich mainly concern the surgical operation.\r\n\r\nThe middle point, between 7, the clavicle, and 6, the sternum, of Plate\r\n4, is marked by a small triangular space occurring between the\r\nclavicular and sternal divisions of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle.\r\nThis space marks the situation (very generally) of the bifurcation of\r\nthe innominate artery into the subclavian and common carotid arteries of\r\nthe right side; a penetrating instrument would, if passed into this\r\nspace at an inch depth, pierce first the root of the internal jugular\r\nvein, and under it, but somewhat internal, the root of either of these\r\ngreat arterial vessels, and would wound the right vagus nerve, as it\r\ntraverses this region. For some extent after the subclavian and carotid\r\nvessels separate from their main common trunk, they lie concealed\r\nbeneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, B, Plate 4, and still deeper beneath\r\nthe sternal origins of the sterno-hyoid muscle, 5, and sterno-thyroid\r\nmuscle, some of whose fibres are traceable at the intervals. The\r\nomo-hyoid muscle and the deep cervical fascia, as will be presently seen,\r\nconceal these vessels also.\r\n\r\nThe subclavian artery, A, Plate 4, first appears superficial to the\r\nabove-named muscles of the cervical region just at the point where,\r\npassing from behind the scalenus muscle, N, Plate 4, which also conceals\r\nit, it sinks behind the clavicle. The exact locality of the artery in\r\nthis part of its course would be indicated by a finger's breadth\r\nexternal to the clavicular attachment of the sterno-mastoid muscle. The\r\nartery passes beneath the clavicle at the middle of this bone, a point\r\nwhich is indicated in most subjects by that cellular interval occurring\r\nbetween the clavicular origins of the deltoid and great pectoral\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nThe posterior cervical triangle, 9, 8, 7, Plate 4, in which the\r\nsubclavian artery is situated, is again subdivided by the muscle\r\nomo-hyoid into two lesser regions, each of which assumes somewhat of a\r\ntriangular shape. The lower one of these embraces the vessel, A, and\r\nthose nerves of the brachial plexus, I, which are in contact with it.\r\nThe posterior belly of the omo-hyoid muscle, K, and the anterior\r\nscalenus muscle, N, form the sides and apex of this lesser triangular\r\nspace, while the horizontal clavicle forms its base. This region of the\r\nsubclavian artery is well defined in the necks of most subjects,\r\nespecially when the muscles are put in action. In lean but muscular\r\nbodies, it is possible to feel the projection of the anterior scalenus\r\nmuscle under the skin, external to the sterno-mastoid. The form of the\r\nomo-hyoid is also to be distinguished in the like bodies. But in all\r\nsubjects may be readily recognised that hollow which occurs above the\r\nclavicle, and between the trapezius, 8, and the sterno cleido-mastoid, 7\r\nB, in the centre of which hollow the artery lies.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the larger posterior cervical triangle, formed by B, the\r\nsterno-mastoid before; 9, the splenius; and 8, the trapezius behind,\r\nand by the clavicle below, are the following mentioned structures--viz.,\r\nA, the subclavian artery, in the third part of its course, as it emerges\r\nfrom behind N, the scalenus anticus; L, the transversalis colli artery,\r\na branch of the thyroid axis, which will be found to cross the\r\nsubclavian vessel at this region; I, the brachial plexus of nerves,\r\nwhich lie external to and above the vessel; H, the external jugular\r\nvein, which sometimes, in conjunction with a plexus of veins coming from\r\nbehind the trapezius muscle, entirely conceals the artery; M, the\r\nposterior scapular artery, a branch of the subclavian, given off from\r\nthe vessel after it has passed from behind the scalenus muscle; O,\r\nnumerous lymphatic glands; P, superficial descending branches of the\r\ncervical plexus of nerves; and Q, ascending superficial branches of the\r\nsame plexus. All these structures, except some of the lymphatic glands,\r\nare concealed by the platysma myoides A, as seen in Plate 3, and beneath\r\nthis by the cervical fascia, which latter shall be hereafter more\r\nclearly represented.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat the same mode as the posterior half of the omo-hyoid\r\nsubdivides the larger posterior triangle into two of lesser dimensions,\r\nthe anterior half of the same muscle divides the anterior triangle into\r\ntwo of smaller capacity.\r\n\r\nThe great anterior triangle, which is marked as that space inclosed\r\nwithin the points, 6, the top of the sternum, the mental symphysis and\r\nthe angle of the maxilla; and whose sides are marked by the median line\r\nof the neck before, the sterno-mastoid behind, and the ramus of the jaw\r\nabove, contains C, the common carotid artery, becoming superficial from\r\nbeneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, and dividing into E, the internal\r\ncarotid, and D, the external carotid. The anterior jugular vein, 3, also\r\noccupies this region below; while some venous branches, which join the\r\nexternal and internal jugular veins, traverse it in all directions, and\r\npresent obstacles to the operator from their meshy plexiform arrangement\r\nyielding, when divided, a profuse haemorrhage.\r\n\r\nThe precise locality at which the common carotid appears from under the\r\nsterno-mastoid muscle is, in almost all instances, opposite to the\r\nthyroid cartilage. At this place, if an incision, dividing the skin,\r\nplatysma and some superficial branches of nerves, be made along the\r\nanterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and this latter be turned\r\na little aside, a process of cervical fascia, and beneath it the sheath\r\nof the carotid artery, will successionally disclose themselves. In many\r\nbodies, however, some degree of careful search requires to be made prior\r\nto the full exposure of the vessel in its sheath, in consequence of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of adipose tissue, some lymphatic glands, and many\r\nsmall veins lying in the immediate vicinity of the carotid artery and\r\ninternal jugular vein. This latter vessel, though usually lying\r\ncompletely concealed by the sterno-mastoid muscle, is frequently to be\r\nseen projecting from under its fore part. In emaciated bodies, where the\r\nsterno-mastoid presents wasted proportions, it will, in consequence,\r\nleave both the main blood-vessels uncovered at this locality in the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThe common carotid artery ascends the cervical region almost\r\nperpendicularly from opposite the sterno-clavicular articulation to the\r\ngreater cornu of the os hyoides. For the greater part of this extent it\r\nis covered by the sterno-mastoid muscle; but as this latter takes an\r\noblique course backwards to its insertion into the mastoid process,\r\nwhile the main blood-vessel dividing into branches still ascends in its\r\noriginal direction, so is it that the artery becomes uncovered by the\r\nmuscle. Even the root of the internal carotid, E, may be readily reached\r\nat this place, where it lies on the same plane as the external carotid,\r\nbut concealed in great part by the internal jugular vein. It would be\r\npossible, while relaxing the sterno-mastoid muscle, to compress either\r\nthe common carotid artery or its main branches against the cervical\r\nvertebral column, if pressure were made in a direction backwards and\r\ninwards. The facial artery V, which springs from the external carotid,\r\nD, may be compressed against the horizontal ramus of the lower jaw-bone\r\nat the anterior border of the masseter muscle. The temporal artery, as\r\nit ascends over the root of the zygoma, may be compressed effectually\r\nagainst this bony point.\r\n\r\nThe external jugular vein, H, Plate 4, as it descends the neck from the\r\nangle of the jaw obliquely backwards over the sterno-mastoid muscle, may\r\nbe easily compressed and opened in any part of its course. This vein\r\ncourses downwards upon the neck in relation to that branch of the\r\nsuperficial cervical plexus, named auricularis magnus nerve, Q, Plate 4,\r\nG, Plate 3. The nerve is generally situated behind the vein, to which it\r\nlies sometimes in close proximity, and is liable, therefore, to be\r\naccidentally injured in the performance of phlebotomy upon the external\r\njugular vein. The coats of the external jugular vein, E, Plate 3, are\r\nsaid to hold connexion with some of the fibres of the platysma-myoides\r\nmuscle, A A, Plate 3, and that therefore, if the vessel be divided\r\ntransversely, the two orifices will remain patent for a time.\r\n\r\nThe position of the carotid artery protects the vessel, in some degree,\r\nagainst the suicidal act, as generally attempted. The depth of the\r\nincision necessary to reach the main blood-vessels from the fore part of\r\nthe neck is so considerable that the wound seldom effects more than the\r\nopening of some part of the larynx. The ossified condition of the\r\nthyroid and cricoid parts of the laryngeal apparatus affords a\r\nprotection to the vessels. The more oblique the incision happens to be,\r\nthe greater probability is there that the wound is comparatively\r\nsuperficial, owing to the circumstance of the instrument having\r\nencountered one or more parts of the hyo-laryngeal range; but woeful\r\nchance sometimes directs the weapon horizontally through that membranous\r\ninterval between the thyroid and hyoid pieces, in which case, as also in\r\nthat where the laryngeal pieces persist permanently cartilaginous, the\r\nresistance to the cutting instrument is much less.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical position of the parotid, H, Plate 3, and submaxillary\r\nglands, W, Plate 4, is so important, that their extirpation, while in a\r\nstate of disease, will almost unavoidably concern other principal\r\nstructures. Whether the diseased parotid gland itself or a lymphatic\r\nbody lying in connexion with it, be the subject of operation, it seldom\r\nhappens that the temporo-maxillary branch of the external carotid, F,\r\nescapes the knife. But an accident, much more liable to occur, and one\r\nwhich produces a great inconvenience afterwards to the subject, is that\r\nof dividing the portio-dura nerve, S, Plate 4, at its exit from the\r\nstylo-mastoid foramen, the consequence being that almost all the muscles\r\nof facial expression become paralyzed. The masseter, L, Plate 3,\r\npterygoid, buccinator, 15, Plate 4, and the facial fibres of the\r\nplatysma muscles, A O, Plate 3, still, however, preserve their power, as\r\nthese structures are innervated from a different source. The orbicularis\r\noculi muscle, which is principally supplied by the portio-dura nerve, is\r\nparalyzed, though it still retains a partial power of contraction, owing\r\nto the anatomical fact that some terminal twigs of the third or motor\r\npair of nerves of the orbit branch into this muscle.\r\n\r\nThe facial artery, V, and the facial vein, U, Plate 4, are in close\r\nconnexion with the submaxillary gland. Oftentimes they traverse the\r\nsubstance of it. The lingual nerve and artery lie in some part of their\r\ncourse immediately beneath the gland. The former two are generally\r\ndivided when the gland is excised; the latter two are liable to be\r\nwounded in the same operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 3 & 4.\r\n\r\nPLATE 3.\r\n\r\nA A A.

But as it is necessary to remove the\r\nsterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, in order to expose the entire range of the\r\ngreater bloodvessels and nerves, so the diagonal which that muscle\r\nforms, as seen in Plates 3 and 4, disappears, and thus both the cervical\r\ntriangles are thrown into one common region. Although, however, the\r\nsterno-mastoid muscle be removed, as seen in Plate 5, still the great\r\nbloodvessels and nerves themselves will be observed to divide the\r\ncervical square diagonally, as they ascend the neck from the\r\nsterno-clavicular articulation to the ear.\r\n\r\nThe diagonal of every square figure is the junction line of the opposite\r\ntriangles which form the square. The cervical square being indicated as\r\nthat space which lies within the mastoid process and the top of the\r\nsternum--the symphysis of the lower maxilla and the top of the shoulder,\r\nit will be seen, in Plate 5, that the line which the common carotid and\r\ninternal jugular vein occupy in the neck, is the diagonal; and hence the\r\njunction line of the two surgical triangles.\r\n\r\nThe general course of the common carotid artery and internal jugular\r\nvein is, therefore, obliquely backwards and upwards through the diagonal\r\nof the cervical square, and passing, as it were, from the point of one\r\nangle of the square to that of the opposite--viz., from the\r\nsterno-clavicular junction to the masto-maxillary space; and, taking the\r\nanterior triangle of the cervical square to be that space included\r\nwithin the points marked H 8 A, Plate 5, it will be seen that the common\r\ncarotid artery ranges along the posterior side of this anterior\r\ntriangle. Again: taking the points 5 Z Y to mark the posterior triangle\r\nof the cervical square, so will it be seen that the internal jugular\r\nvein and the common carotid artery, with the vagus nerve between them,\r\nrange the anterior side of this posterior triangle, while the subclavian\r\nartery, Q, passes through the centre of the inferior side of the\r\nposterior triangle, that is, under the middle of the shaft of the\r\nclavicle.\r\n\r\nThe main blood vessels (apparently according to original design) will be\r\nfound always to occupy the centre of the animal fabric, and to seek\r\ndeep-seated protection under cover of the osseous skeleton. The\r\nvertebrae of the neck, like those of the back and loins, support the\r\nprincipal vessels. Even in the limbs the large bloodvessels range\r\nalongside the protective shafts of the bones. The skeletal points are\r\ntherefore the safest guides to the precise localities of the\r\nbloodvessels, and such points are always within the easy recognition of\r\ntouch and sight.\r\n\r\nClose behind the right sterno-clavicular articulation, but separated\r\nfrom it by the sternal insertions of the thin ribbon-like muscles named\r\nsterno-hyoid and thyroid, together with the cervical fascia, is situated\r\nthe brachio-cephalic or innominate artery, A B, Plates 5 and 6, having\r\nat its outer side the internal jugular division of the brachio-cephalic\r\nvein, W K, Plate 5. Between these vessels lies the vagus nerve, E, Plate\r\n6, N, Plate 5. The common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and\r\nvagus nerve, hold in respect to each other the same relationship in the\r\nneck, as far upwards as the angle of the jaw. While we view the general\r\nlateral outline of the neck, we find that, in the same measure as the\r\nblood vessels ascend from the thorax to the skull, they recede from the\r\nfore-part of the root of the neck to the angle of the jaw, whereby a\r\nmuch greater interval occurs between them and the mental symphysis, or\r\nthe apex of the thyroid cartilage, than happens between them and the top\r\nof the sternum, as they lie at the root of the neck. This variation as\r\nto the width of the interval between the vessels and fore-part of the\r\nneck, in these two situations, is owing to two causes, 1st, the somewhat\r\noblique course taken by the vessels from below upwards; 2dly, the\r\nprojecting development of the adult lower jaw-bone, and also of the\r\nlaryngeal apparatus, which latter organ, as it grows to larger\r\nproportions in the male than in the female, will cause the interval at\r\nthis place to be much greater in the one than the other. In the infant,\r\nthe larynx is of such small size, as scarcely to stand out beyond the\r\nlevel of the vessels, viewed laterally.\r\n\r\nThe internal jugular vein is for almost its entire length covered by the\r\nsterno-mastoid muscle, and by that layer of the cervical aponeurosis\r\nwhich lies between the vessels and the muscle. The two vessels, K C,\r\nPlate 5, with the vagus nerve, are enclosed in a common sheath of\r\ncellular membrane, which sends processes between them so as to isolate\r\nthe structures in some degree from one another.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the common carotid artery is in close proximity to the\r\nvagus nerve, this latter lying at the vessel's posterior side. The\r\ninternal jugular vein, which sometimes lies upon and covering the\r\ncarotid, will be found in general separated from it for a little space.\r\nOpposite the os hyoides, the internal jugular vein lies closer to the\r\ncommon carotid than it does farther down towards the root of the neck.\r\nOpposite to the sterno-clavicular articulation, the internal jugular\r\nvein will be seen separated from the common carotid for an interval of\r\nan inch and more in width, and at this interval appears the root of the\r\nsubclavian artery, B, Plates 5 and 6, giving off its primary branches,\r\nviz., the thyroid axis, D, the vertebral and internal mammary arteries,\r\nat the first part of its course.\r\n\r\nThe length of the common carotid artery varies, of course, according to\r\nthe place where the innominate artery below divides, and also according\r\nto that place whereat the common carotid itself divides into internal\r\nand external carotids. In general, the length of the common carotid is\r\nconsiderable, and ranges between the sterno-clavicular articulation and\r\nthe level of the os hyoides; throughout the whole of this length, it\r\nseldom or never happens that a large arterial branch is given off from\r\nthe vessel, and the operation of ligaturing the common carotid is\r\ntherefore much more likely to answer the results required of that\r\nproceeding than can be expected from the ligature of any part of the\r\nsubclavian artery which gives off large arterial branches from every\r\npart of its course.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic nerve, R, Plate 6, is as close to the carotid artery\r\nbehind, as the vagus nerve, N, Plate 5, and is as much endangered in\r\nligaturing this vessel. The branch of the ninth nerve, E, Plate 5,\r\n(descendens noni,) lies upon the common carotid, itself or its sheath,\r\nand is likely to be included in the ligature oftener than we are aware\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of the external carotid, D, Plate 5, is in all cases very\r\nshort, and in many bodies can scarcely be said to exist, in consequence\r\nof the thyroid, lingual, facial, temporal, and occipital branches,\r\nspringing directly from almost the same point at which the common\r\ncarotid gives off the internal carotid artery. The internal carotid is\r\ncertainly the continuation of the common arterial trunk, while the\r\nvessel named external carotid is only a series of its branches. If the\r\ngreater size of the internal carotid artery, compared to that of the\r\nexternal carotid, be not sufficient to prove that the former is the\r\nproper continuation of the common carotid, a fact may be drawn from\r\ncomparative philosophy which will put the question beyond doubt,\r\nnamely--that as the common carotid follows the line of the cervical\r\nvertebrae, just as the aorta follows that of the vertebrae of the trunk,\r\nso does the internal carotid follow the line of the cephalic vertebrae.\r\nI liken, therefore, those branches of the so-called external carotid to\r\nbe, as it were, the visceral arteries of the face and neck. It would be\r\nquite possible to demonstrate this point of analogy, were this the place\r\nfor analogical reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe common carotid, or the internal, may be compressed against the\r\nrectus capitis anticus major muscle, 13, Plate 6, as it lies on the\r\nfore-part of the vertebral column. The internal maxillary artery, 16,\r\nPlate 6, and the facial artery, G, Plate 5, are those vessels which\r\nbleed when the lower maxilla is amputated. In this operation, the\r\ntemporal artery, 15, Plate 6, will hardly escape being divided also, it\r\nlies in such close proximity to the neck and condyle of the jaw-bone.\r\n\r\nThe subclavian artery, B Q, Plate 5, traverses the root of the neck, in\r\nan arched direction from the sterno-clavicular articulation to the\r\nmiddle of the shaft of the clavicle, beneath which it passes, being\r\ndestined for the arm. In general, this vessel rises to a level\r\nconsiderably above the clavicle; and all that portion of the arching\r\ncourse which it makes at this situation over the first rib has become\r\nthe subject of operation. The middle of this arching subclavian artery\r\nis (by as much as the thickness of the scalenus muscle, X, Plate 5)\r\ndeeper situated than either extremity of the arch of this vessel, and\r\ndeeper also than any part of the common carotid, by the same fact. So\r\nmany branches spring from all parts of the arch of the subclavian\r\nartery, that the operation of ligaturing this vessel is less successful\r\nthan the same operation exercised on others.\r\n\r\nThe structures which lie in connexion with the arch of the subclavian\r\nalso render the operation of tying the vessel an anxious task. It is\r\ncrossed and recrossed at all points by large veins, important nerves,\r\nand by its own principal branches. The vagus nerve, S E, Plate 6,\r\ncrosses it at B, its root; external to which place the large internal\r\njugular vein, K, Plate 5, lies upon it; external to this latter, the\r\nscalenus muscle, X, Plate 5, with the phrenic nerve lying upon the\r\nmuscle, binds it fixedly to the first rib; more external still, the\r\ncommon trunk of the external jugular and shoulder veins, U, Plate 5, lie\r\nupon the vessel, and it is in the immediate vicinity of the great\r\nbrachial plexus of nerves, P P, which pass down along its humeral\r\nborder, many branches of the same plexus sometimes crossing it\r\nanteriorly.\r\n\r\nThe depth at which the middle of the subclavian artery lies may be\r\nlearned by the space which those structures, beneath which it passes,\r\nnecessarily occupy. The clavicle at its sternal end is round and thick,\r\nwhere it gives attachment to the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle. The root\r\nof the internal jugular vein, when injected, will be seen to occupy\r\nconsiderable space behind the clavicle; and the anterior scalenus muscle\r\nis substantial and fleshy. The united spaces occupied by these\r\nstructures give the depth of the subclavian artery in the middle part of\r\nits course.\r\n\r\nThe length of the subclavian artery between its point of branching from\r\nthe innominate and that where it gives off its first branches varies in\r\ndifferent bodies, but is seldom so extensive as to assure the operator\r\nof the ultimate success of the process of ligaturing the vessel. Above\r\nand below D, Plate 6, the thyroid axis, come off the vertebral and\r\ninternal mammary arteries internal and anterior to the scalenus muscle.\r\nExternal and posterior to the scalenus, a large vessel, the post\r\nscapular, G, Plate 6, R, Plate 5, arises. If an aneurism attack any part\r\nof this subclavian arch, it must be in close connexion with some one of\r\nthese branches. If a ligature is to be applied to any part of the arch,\r\nit will seldom happen that it can be placed farther than half an inch\r\nfrom some of these principal collateral branches.\r\n\r\nWhen the shoulder is depressed, the clavicle follows it, and the\r\nsubclavian artery will be more exposed and more easily reached than if\r\nthe shoulder be elevated, as this latter movement raises the clavicle\r\nover the locality of the vessel. Dupuytren alludes practically to the\r\ndifferent depths of the subclavian artery in subjects with short necks\r\nand high shoulders, and those with long necks and pendent shoulders.\r\nWhen the clavicle is depressed to the fullest extent, if then the\r\nsterno-cleido-mastoid and scalenus muscles be relaxed by inclining the\r\nhead and neck towards the artery, I believe it may be possible to arrest\r\nthe flow of blood through the artery by compressing it against the first\r\nrib, and this position will also facilitate the operation of ligaturing\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nThe subclavian vein, W, Plate 5, is removed to some distance from the\r\nartery, Q, Plate 5. The width of the scalenus muscle, X, separates the\r\nvein from the artery. An instance is recorded by Blandin in which the\r\nvein passed in company with the artery under the scalenus muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 5 & 6.\r\n\r\nPLATE 5.\r\n\r\nA.

Thus the order of superposition taken by the integument,\r\nthe fasciae, the muscles, bones, veins, nerves, and arteries, which\r\noccupy both the surgical triangles of the neck, will be readily\r\nrecognised in the opposite Plates.\r\n\r\nThe depth of a bloodvessel or other organ from surface will vary for\r\nmany reasons, even though the same parts in the natural order of\r\nsuperposition shall overlie the whole length of the vessel or organ\r\nwhich we make search for. The principal of those reasons are:--1st, that\r\nthe stratified organs themselves vary in thickness at several places;\r\n2d, that the organ or vessel which we seek will itself incline to\r\nsurface from deeper levels occupied elsewhere; 3d, that the normal\r\nundulations of surface will vary the depth of the particular vessels,\r\n&c.; and 4th, that the natural mobility of the superimposed parts will\r\nallow them to change place in some measure, and consequently influence\r\nthe relative position of the object of search. On this account it is\r\nthat the surgical anatomist chooses to give a fixed position to the\r\nsubject about to be operated on, in order to reduce the number of these\r\ndifficulties as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn Plate 7 will be seen the surgical relationship of parts lying in the\r\nvicinity of the common carotid artery, at the point of its bifurcation\r\ninto external and internal carotids. At this locality, the vessel will\r\nbe found, in general, subjacent to the following mentioned structures,\r\nnumbered from the superficies to its own level--viz., the common\r\nintegument and subcutaneous adipose membrane, which will vary in\r\nthickness in several individuals; next, the platysma myoides muscle, F\r\nL, which is identified with the superficial fascia, investing the outer\r\nsurface of the sterno-mastoid muscle; next, the deeper layer of the same\r\nfascia, R S., which passes beneath the sterno-mastoid muscle, but over\r\nthe sheath of the vessels; and next, the sheath of the vessels, Q, which\r\ninvests them and isolates them from adjacent structures. Though the\r\nvessel lies deeper than the level of the sterno-mastoid muscle at this\r\nlocality, yet it is not covered by the muscle in the same manner, as it\r\nis lower down in the neck. At this place, therefore, though the actual\r\ndepth of the artery from surface will be the same, whether it be covered\r\nor uncovered by the sterno-mastoid muscle, still we know that the\r\nlocality of the vessel relative to the parts actually superimposed will\r\nvary accordingly. This observation will apply to the situation and\r\nrelative position of all the other vessels as well. Other occurrences\r\nwill vary the relations of the artery in regard to superjacent\r\nstructures, though the actual depth of the vessel from surface may be\r\nthe same. If the internal jugular vein covers the carotid artery, as it\r\nsometimes does, or if a plexus of veins, gathering from the fore-part of\r\nthe neck or face, overlie the vessel, or if a chain of lymphatic bodies\r\nbe arranged upon it, as is frequently the case, the knowledge of such\r\noccurrences will guard the judgment against being led into error by the\r\nconventionalities of the descriptive method of anatomists. The normal\r\nrelative anatomy of the bloodvessels is taken by anatomists to be the\r\nmore frequent disposition of their main trunks and branches, considered\r\nper se, and in connexion with neighbouring parts. But it will be seen by\r\nthis avowal that those vessels are liable to many various conditions;\r\nand such is the case, in fact. No anatomist can pronounce with exactness\r\nthe precise figure of vessels or other organs while they lie concealed\r\nbeneath the surface. An approach to truth is all that the best\r\nexperience can boast of. The form and relations of the carotid vessels\r\nof Plate 7 may or may not be the same as those concealed beneath the\r\nsame region of Plate 8, at the point R.\r\n\r\nThe motions of the head upon the neck, or of the neck upon the trunk,\r\nwill influence the relative position of the vessels A C B, of Plate 7,\r\nand therefore we take a fixed surgical position, in the expectation of\r\nfinding that the carotid artery projects from under the anterior border\r\nof the upper third of the sterno-mastoid muscle, opposite the upper\r\nborder of the thyroid cartilage; at this situation of the vessels, viz.,\r\nR, Plate 8, opposite O, the thyroid projection, is in general to be\r\nfound the anatomical relation of the vessels as they appear dissected in\r\nPlate 7. Of these vessels, the main trunks are less liable to anomalous\r\ncharacter than the minor branches.\r\n\r\nThe relative position of the subclavian artery is as liable to be\r\ninfluenced by the motions of the clavicle on the sternum, as that of the\r\ncarotid is by the motions of the lower jaw-bone on the skull, or by the\r\nlarynx, in its own motions at the fore-part of the neck. It becomes as\r\nnecessary, therefore, in the performance of surgical operations upon the\r\nsubclavian artery, to fix the clavicle by depressing it, as in Plate 8,\r\nas it is to give fixity to the lower maxilla and larynx, in the position\r\nof Plate 7, when the carotid is the subject of operation.\r\n\r\nThe same named structures, but different as to their parts, will be\r\nfound to overlie the subclavian artery as are found to conceal the\r\ncarotid artery. The skin, the fascia, and platysma muscle, the\r\nsterno-cleido-mastoid muscle, the deep layer of the cervical fascia,\r\n&c., cover both vessels. One additional muscle binds down the subclavian\r\nartery, viz., the scalenus anticus. The omo-hyoid relates to both\r\nvessels, the anterior division to the carotid, the posterior to the\r\nsubclavian.\r\n\r\nThe carotid artery lies uncovered by the sterno-mastoid muscle, opposite\r\nto the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, or the hyoid bone; and the\r\nsubclavian artery emerges from under cover of a different part of the\r\nsame muscle, opposite the middle of the clavicle. These points of\r\nrelationship to the skeletal parts can be ascertained by the touch, in\r\nboth instances, even in the undissected body. The thyroid point, O, of\r\nPlate 8, indicates the line, R N, which the carotid artery traverses in\r\nthe same figure, along the anterior border of the sterno-mastoid muscle,\r\nas seen in the dissected region of Plate 7. The mid-point of the\r\nclavicle, U, Plate 7, and the top of the sternum in the same figure,\r\nwill, while the eye follows the arching line, Z X T V, indicate with\r\ncorrectness the arching course of the subclavian, such as is represented\r\nin the dissection of that vessel, B, Plate 8.\r\n\r\nThe subclavian artery has no special sheath, properly so called; but the\r\ndeep layer of the cervical fascia, P, Plate 8, which passes under A, the\r\nclavicular portion of the sterno-mastoid muscle, and becomes of\r\nconsiderable thickness and density, sheaths over the vessel in this\r\nregion of its course.\r\n\r\nA very complex condition of the veins which join the external jugular at\r\nthis part of the course of the subclavian artery is now and then to be\r\nfound overlying that vessel. If the hemorrhage consequent upon the\r\nopening of these veins, or that of the external jugular, be so profuse\r\nas to impede the operation of ligaturing the subclavian artery, it may\r\nin some measure be arrested by compressing them against the resisting\r\nparts adjacent, when the operator, feeling for D, the scalenus muscle,\r\nand the first rib to which it is attached, cannot fail to alight upon\r\nthe main artery itself, B, Plate 8.\r\n\r\nThe middle of the shaft of the clavicle is a much safer guide to the\r\nvessel than are the muscles which contribute to form this posterior\r\ntriangle of the neck, in which the subclavian vessel is located. The\r\nform or position of the clavicle in the depressed condition of the\r\nshoulder, as seen in Plate 8, is invariable; whereas that of the\r\ntrapezius and sterno-mastoid muscles is inconstant, these muscles being\r\nfound to stand at unequal intervals from each other in several bodies.\r\nThe space between the insertions of both these muscles is indefinite,\r\nand may vary in degrees of width from the whole length of the clavicle\r\nto half an inch; or, as in some instances, leaving no interval whatever.\r\nThe position of the omo-hyoid muscle will not be accounted a sure guide\r\nto the locality of the subclavian artery, since, in fact, it varies\r\nconsiderably as to its relationship with that vessel. The tense cords of\r\nthe brachial plexus of nerves, F, Plate 8, which will be found, for the\r\nmost part, ranging along the acromial border of the artery, are a much\r\nsurer guide to the vessel.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the subclavian artery, at B, Plate 8, with the common\r\ncarotid artery, at A, Plate 7, I believe that the former will be found\r\nto exhibit, on the whole a greater constancy in respect to the\r\nfollowing-mentioned condition--viz., a single main arterial trunk arches\r\nover the first rib to pass beneath the middle of the clavicle, while the\r\ncarotid artery opposite the thyroid piece of the larynx is by no means\r\nconstantly single as a common carotid trunk. The place of division of\r\nthe common carotid is not definite, and, therefore, the precise\r\nsituation in the upper two-thirds of the neck, where it may present as a\r\nsingle main vessel, cannot be predicted with certainty in the\r\nundissected body. There is no other main artery of the body more liable\r\nto variation than that known as external carotid. It is subject to as\r\nmany changes of character in respect to the place of its branching from\r\nthe common carotid, and also in regard to the number of its own\r\nbranches, as any of the lesser arteries of the system. It is but as an\r\naggregate of the branches of that main arterial trunk which ranges from\r\nthe carotid foramen of the temporal bone to the aorta; and, as a branch\r\nof a larger vessel, it is, therefore, liable to spring from various\r\nplaces of the principal trunk, just as we find to be the case with all\r\nthe other minor branches of the larger arteries. Its name, external\r\ncarotid, is as unfittingly applied to it, in comparison with the vessel\r\nfrom which it springs, as the name external subclavian would be if\r\napplied to the thyroid axis of the larger subclavian vessel. The\r\nnomenclature of surgical anatomy does not, however, court a\r\nphilosophical inquiry into that propriety of speech which comparative\r\nscience demands, nor is it supposed to be necessary in a practical point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nIt will, however, sound more euphoneously with reason, and at the same\r\ntime, I believe, be found not altogether unrelated to the useful, if,\r\nwhen such conditions as the \"anomalies of form\" present themselves, we\r\ncan advance an interpretation of the same, in addition to the dry record\r\nof them as isolated facts. Comparative anatomy, which alone can furnish\r\nthese interpretations, will therefore prove to be no alien to the\r\npractical, while it may lend explanation to those bizarreries which\r\nimpede the way of the anthropotomist. All the anomalies of form, both as\r\nregards the vascular, the muscular, and the osseous systems of the human\r\nbody, are analyzed by comparison through the animal series. Numerous\r\ncases are on record of the subclavian artery being found complicated\r\nwith supernumerary ribs jutting from the 5th, 6th, or 7th cervical\r\nvertebrae. [Footnote] To these I shall add another, in respect of the\r\ncarotid arteries--viz., that I have found them complicated with an\r\nosseous shaft of bone, taking place of the stylo-hyoid ligament, a\r\ncondition which obtains permanently in the ruminant and other classes of\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: I have given an explanation of these facts in my work on\r\nComparative Osteology and the Archetype Skeleton, to which, and also to\r\nProfessor Owen's work, entitled Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton, I\r\nrefer the reader.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 7 & 8.\r\n\r\nPLATE 7.\r\n\r\nA.

The general median line\r\nof the human body is characterized as the point of fusion of the two\r\nsides; and all structures or organs which range this common centre are\r\neither symmetrically azygos, or symmetrically duplex. The azygos organ\r\npresents as a symmetrical unity, and the duplex organ as a symmetrical\r\nduality. The surgical anatomist takes a studious observation of this law\r\nof symmetry; and knowing it to be one of general and almost\r\nunexceptional occurrence, he practises according to its manifestation.\r\n\r\nThe vascular as well as the osseous skeleton displays the law of\r\nsymmetry; but while the osseous system offers no exception to this law,\r\nthe vascular system offers one which, in a surgical point of view, is of\r\nconsiderable importance--namely, that behind the right sterno-clavicular\r\narticulation, C, Plate 9, is found the artery, A, named innominate, this\r\nbeing the common trunk of the right common carotid and subclavian\r\nvessels; while on the left side, behind the left sterno-clavicular\r\njunction, Q, Plate 10, the two vessels (subclavian, B, and carotid, A,)\r\nspring separately from the aortic arch. This fact of asymmetrical\r\narrangement in the arterial trunks at the fore part of the root of the\r\nneck is not, however, of invariable occurrence; on the contrary,\r\nnumerous instances are observed where the arteries in question, on the\r\nright side as well as the left, arise separately from the aorta; and\r\nthus Nature reverts to the original condition of perfect symmetry as\r\ngoverning the development of even the vascular skeleton. And not\r\nunfrequently, as if to invite us to the inquiry whether a separate\r\norigin of the four vessels (subclavian and carotid) from the aorta, or a\r\ndouble innominate condition of the vessels, were the original form with\r\nNature, we find her also presenting this latter arrangement of them. An\r\ninnominate or common aortic origin may happen for the carotid and\r\nsubclavian arteries of the left side, as well as the right. Hence,\r\ntherefore, while experience may arm the judgment with a general rule,\r\nsuch generality should not render us unmindful of the possible\r\nexception.\r\n\r\nWhen, as in Plate 9, A, the innominate artery rises to a level with C,\r\nthe right sterno-clavicular junction, and when at this place it\r\nbifurcates, having on its left side, D, the trachea, and on its right\r\nside, B, the root of the internal jugular vein, together with a, the\r\nvagus nerve, the arterial vessel is said to be of normal character, and\r\nholding a normal position relative to adjacent organs. When, as in Plate\r\n10, A, the common carotid, and B, the subclavian artery, rise separately\r\nfrom the aortic arch to a level with Q, the left sterno-clavicular\r\narticulation, the vessels having M, the trachea, to their inner side,\r\nand  C D, the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian veins, to\r\ntheir outer side, with b, the left vagus nerve, between them, then the\r\narterial vessels are accounted as being of normal character, and as\r\nholding a normal relative position. Every exception to this condition of\r\nA, Plate 9, or to that of A B, Plate 10, is said to be abnormal or\r\npeculiar, and merely because the disposition of the vessels, as seen in\r\nPlates 9 and 10, is taken to be general or of more frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nNow, though it is not my present purpose to burden this subject of\r\nregional anatomy with any lengthy inquiry into the comparative meaning\r\nof the facts, why a common innominate trunk should occur on the right of\r\nthe median line, while separate arterial trunks for the carotid and\r\nsubclavian arteries should spring from the aorta on the left of this\r\nmid-line, thus making a remarkable exception to the rule of symmetry\r\nwhich characterizes all the arterial vessels elsewhere, still I cannot\r\nbut regard this exceptional fact of asymmetry as in itself expressing a\r\nquestion by no means foreign to the interests of the practical.\r\n\r\nIn the abstract or general survey of all those peculiarities of length\r\nto which the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, is subject, I here lay it\r\ndown as a proposition, that they occur as graduated phases of the\r\nbicleavage of this innominate trunk from the level of A, to the aortic\r\narch, in which latter phasis the aorta gives a separate origin to the\r\ncarotid and subclavian vessels of the right side as well as the left. On\r\nthe other hand, I observe that the peculiarities to the normal separate\r\ncondition of A and B, the carotid and subclavian arteries of Plate 10,\r\ndisplay, in the relationary aggregate, a phasial gradation of A and B\r\njoining into a common trunk union, in which state we then find the aorta\r\ngiving origin to a right and left innominate artery. Between these two\r\nforms of development--viz., that where the four vessels spring\r\nseparately from the aortic arch, and that where two innominate or\r\nbrachio-cephalic arteries arise from the same--may be read all the sum\r\nof variation to which these vessels are liable. It is true that there\r\nare some states of these vessels which cannot be said to be naturally\r\nembraced in the above generalization; but though I doubt not that these\r\nmight be encompassed in a higher generalization; still, for all\r\npractical ends, the lesser general rule is all-sufficient.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, is of such\r\nextraordinary length, that it rises considerably (for an inch, or even\r\nmore) above the level of C, the sternal end of the clavicle. In other\r\ncases, the innominate artery bifurcates soon after it leaves the first\r\npart of the aortic arch; and between these extremes as to length, the\r\nvessel varies infinitesimally.\r\n\r\nThe innominate artery lies closer behind the right sterno-clavicular\r\njunction than the left carotid or subclavian arteries lie in relation to\r\nthe left sterno-clavicular articulation; and this difference of depth\r\nbetween the vessel of the right side and those of the left is mainly\r\nowing to the form and direction of the aortic arch from which they take\r\norigin. The aortic arch ranges, not alone transversely, but also from\r\nbefore backward, and to the left side of the dorsal spine; and\r\nconsequently, as the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, springs from the\r\nfirst or fore part of the aorta, while the left carotid and subclavian\r\narteries arise from the second and deeper part of its arch, the vessels\r\nof both sides rising into the neck perpendicularly from the root in the\r\nthorax, will still, in the cervical region, manifest a considerable\r\ndifference as to antero-posterior depth. The depth of the left\r\nsubclavian artery, B, Plate 10, from cervical surface, is even greater\r\nthan that of the left common carotid, A, Plate 10, and this latter, at\r\nits root in the aortic arch, is deeper than the innominate artery. Both\r\ncommon carotids, A A, Plates 9 and 10, hold nearly the same\r\nantero-posterior depth on either side of the trachea, M, Plate 10, and\r\nD, Plate 9. Although the relative depth of the arterial vessels on both\r\nsides of the trachea is different, still they are covered by an equal\r\nnumber of identical structures, taking the same order of superposition.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the episternal cervical pit, which, even in the\r\nundissected body of male or female, infant or adult, is always a\r\nwell-marked surgical feature, may be readily recognised the converging\r\nsternal attachments of the sterno-mastoid muscles, L G, Plate 10; and\r\nmidway between these symmetrical muscular prominences in the neck, but\r\nholding a deeper level than them, is situated that part of the trachea\r\nwhich is generally the subject of the operation of tracheotomy. The\r\nrelative anatomy of the trachea, M, Plate 10, D, Plate 9, at this\r\nsituation requires therefore to be carefully considered. The trachea is\r\nsaid to incline rather to the right side of the median line; but perhaps\r\nthis observation would be more true to nature if it were accompanied by\r\nthe remark, that this seeming inclination to the right side is owing to\r\nthe fact, that the innominate artery, A, Plate 9, lies obliquely over\r\nits fore part, near the sternum. However this may be, it certainly will\r\nbe the safer step in the operation to regard the median position of the\r\ntrachea as fixed, than to encroach upon the locality of the carotid\r\nvessels; and to make the incision longitudinally and exactly through the\r\nmedian line, while the neck is extended backwards, and the chin made to\r\ncorrespond with the line of incision. And when the operator takes into\r\nconsideration the situation of the vessel A, Plate 9, and A, Plate 10,\r\nat this region of the neck, he will at once own to the necessity of\r\nopening the trachea, D, Plate 9, M, Plate 10, at a situation nearer the\r\nlarynx than the point marked in the figures. The course taken by the\r\ncommon carotid arteries is, in respect to the trachea, divergent from\r\nbelow upwards; and as these vessels will consequently be found to stand\r\nwider apart at the level of K, I, Plate 10, than they do at the level of\r\nM, Plate 10, so the farther upwards from the sternum we choose the point\r\nat which to open the trachea, the less likely are we to endanger the\r\ngreat arterial vessels.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fact, that the carotid arteries at an inch above the\r\nsternum lie nearer the median line than they do higher up in the neck,\r\nit should always be remembered, that the trachea itself is situated much\r\ndeeper at the point M, Plate 10, D, Plate 9, than it is opposite the\r\npoints F and K of the same figures. The laryngo-tracheal line is, in the\r\nlateral view of the neck, downwards and backwards, and therefore it will\r\nbe found always at a considerable depth from cervical surface, as it\r\npasses behind the first bone of the sternum, midway between both\r\nsterno-mastoid muscles.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of tracheotomy, the cutting instrument divides the\r\nfollowing named structures as they lie beneath the common integument: If\r\nthe incision be made directly upon the median line, the muscles F,\r\nsterno-hyoid, and E, sterno-thyroid, Plate 9, are not necessarily\r\ndivided, as these structures and their fellows hold a somewhat lateral\r\nposition opposite to each other. Beneath these muscles and above them,\r\nthus encasing them, the cervical fascia, f f, Plate 10, is required to\r\nbe divided, in order to expose the trachea. Beneath f f the cervical\r\nfascia, will next be felt the rounded bilobed mass of the thyroid body,\r\nlying on the forepart of the trachea; above the thyroid body, the\r\ncricoid and some tracheal cartilaginous rings will be felt; and since\r\nthe thyroid body varies much as to bulk in several individuals of the\r\nsame and different sexes, as also from a consideration that its\r\nsubstance is traversed by large arterial and venous vessels, it will be\r\ntherefore preferable to open the trachea above it, than through it or\r\nbelow it.\r\n\r\nOn the forepart of the tracheal median line, either superficial to, or\r\ndeeper than, the cervical fascia, the tracheotomist occasionally meets\r\nwith a chain of lymphatic glands or a plexus of veins, which latter,\r\nwhen divided, will trammel the operation by the copious haemorrhage\r\nwhich all veins at this region of the neck are prone to supply, owing to\r\ntheir direct communication with the main venous trunks of the heart; and\r\nnot unfrequently the inferior thyroid artery overlies the trachea at the\r\npoint D, Plate 9, when this thyroid vessel arises directly from the arch\r\nof the aorta, between the roots of the innominate and left common\r\ncarotid, or when it springs from the innominate itself. The inferior\r\nthyroid vein, sometimes single and sometimes double, overlies the\r\ntrachea at the point D, Plate 9, when this vein opens into the left\r\ninnominate venous trunk, as this latter crosses over the root of the\r\nmain arteries springing from the aorta.\r\n\r\nLaryngotomy is, anatomically considered, a far less dangerous operation\r\nthan tracheotomy, for the above-named reasons; and the former should\r\nalways be preferred when particular circumstances do not render the\r\nlatter operation absolutely necessary. In addition to the fact, that the\r\ncarotid arteries lie farther apart from each other and from the median\r\nplace--viz., the crico-thyroid interval, which is the seat of\r\nlaryngotomy--than they do lower down on either side of the trachea, it\r\nshould also be noticed that the tracheal tube being more moveable than\r\nthe larynx, is hence more liable to swerve from the cutting instrument,\r\nand implicate the vessels. Tracheotomy on the infant is a far more\r\nanxious proceeding than the same operation performed on the adult;\r\nbecause the trachea in the infant's body lies more closely within the\r\nembrace of the carotid arteries, is less in diameter, shorter, and more\r\nmobile than in the adult body.\r\n\r\nThe episternal or interclavicular region is a locality traversed by so\r\nmany vitally important structures gathered together in a very limited\r\nspace, that all operations which concern this region require more steady\r\ncaution and anatomical knowledge than most surgeons are bold enough to\r\ntest their possession of. The reader will (on comparing Plates 9 and 10)\r\nbe enabled to take account of those structures which it is necessary to\r\ndivide in the operation required for ligaturing the innominate artery,\r\nA, Plate 9, or either of those main arterial vessels (the right common\r\ncarotid and subclavian) which spring from it; and he will also observe\r\nthat, although the same number and kind of structures overlie the\r\ncarotid and subclavian vessels, A B, of the left side, Plate 10, still,\r\nthat these vessels themselves, in consequence of their separate\r\ncondition, will materially influence the like operation in respect to\r\nthem. An aneurism occurring in the first part of the course of the right\r\nsubclavian artery, at the locality a, Plate 9, will lie so close to the\r\norigin of the right common carotid as to require a ligature to be passed\r\naround the innominate common trunk, thus cutting off the flow of blood\r\nfrom both vessels; whereas an aneurism implicating either the left\r\ncommon carotid at the point A, or the left subclavian artery at the\r\npoint B, does not, of course, require that both vessels should be\r\nincluded in the same ligature. There seems to be, therefore, a greater\r\nprobability of effectually treating an aneurism of the left\r\nbrachio-cephalic vessels by ligature than attaches to those of the right\r\nside; for if space between collateral branches, and also a lesser\r\ncaliber of arterial trunk, be advantages, allowing the ligature to hold\r\nmore firmly, then the vessels of the left side of the root of the neck\r\nmanifest these advantages more frequently than those of the right, which\r\nspring from a common trunk. Whenever, therefore, the \"peculiarity\" of a\r\nseparate aortic origin of the right carotid and subclavian arteries\r\noccurs, it is to be regarded more as a happy advantage than otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 9 & 10.\r\n\r\nPLATE 9.\r\n\r\nA.

These very boundaries themselves, being moveable\r\nparts, must accordingly influence the relative position of the\r\nstructures which they bound, and thus either include within or exclude\r\nfrom the particular region those structures wholly or in part which are\r\nsaid to be proper to it. Of this kind of conventional surgical boundary\r\nthe moveable clavicle is an example; and the bloodvessels which it\r\noverarches manifest consequently neither termination nor origin except\r\nartificially from the fixed position which the bone, R, assumes, as in\r\nPlate 11, or c*, Plate 12. In this position of the arm in relation to\r\nthe trunk, the subclavian artery, B, terminates at the point where,\r\nproperly speaking, it first takes its name; and from this point to the\r\nposterior fold of the axilla formed by the latissimus dorsi muscle, O,\r\nPlate 11, N, Plate 12, and the anterior fold formed by the great\r\npectoral muscle, K, Plate 11, I, Plate 12, the continuation of the\r\nsubclavian artery is named axillary. From the posterior fold of the\r\naxilla, O P, Plate 11, to the bend of the elbow, the same main vessels\r\ntake the name of brachial.\r\n\r\nWhen the axillary space is cut into from the forepart through the great\r\npectoral muscle, H K, Plate 11, and beneath this through the lesser\r\npectoral muscle, L I, together with the fascial processes which invest\r\nthese muscles anteriorly and posteriorly, the main bloodvessels and\r\nnerves which traverse this space are displayed, holding in general that\r\nrelative position which they exhibit in Plate 11. These vessels, with\r\ntheir accompanying nerves, will be seen continued from those of the\r\nneck; and thus may be attained in one view a comparative estimate of the\r\ncervical and axillary regions, together with their line of union beneath\r\nthe clavicle, c*, Plate 12, R, Plate 11, which serves to divide them\r\nsurgically.\r\n\r\nIn the neck, the subclavian artery, B, Plate 11, is seen to be separated\r\nfrom the subclavian vein, A, by the breadth of the anterior scalenus\r\nmuscle, D, as the vessels arch over the first rib, F. In this region of\r\nthe course of the vessels, the brachial plexus of nerves, C, ranges\r\nalong the outer border of the artery, B, and is separated by the artery\r\nfrom the vein, A, as all three structures pass beneath the clavicle, R,\r\nand the subclavius muscle, E. From this latter point the vessels and\r\nnerves take the name axillary, and in this axillary region the relative\r\nposition of the nerves and vessels to each other and to the adjacent\r\norgans is somewhat changed. For now in the axillary region the vein, a,\r\nis in direct contact with the artery, b, on the forepart and somewhat to\r\nthe inner side of which the vein lies; while the nerves, D, d, Plate 12,\r\nembrace the artery in a mesh or plexus of chords, from which it is often\r\ndifficult to extricate it, for the purpose of ligaturing, in the dead\r\nsubject, much less the living. The axillary plexus of nerves well merits\r\nthe name, for I have not found it in any two bodies assuming a similar\r\norder or arrangement. Perhaps the order in which branches spring from\r\nthe brachial plexus that is most constantly met with is the one\r\nrepresented at D, Plate 12, where we find, on the outer border of B, the\r\naxillary artery, a nervous chord, d, giving off a thoracic branch to\r\npass behind H, the lesser pectoral muscle, while the main chord itself,\r\nd, soon divides into two branches, one the musculo-cutaneous, e, which\r\npierces G, the coraco-brachialis muscle, and the other which forms one\r\nof the roots of the median nerve, h. Following that order of the nerves\r\nas they are shown in Plate 12, they may be enumerated from without\r\ninwards as follows:--the external or musculo-cutaneous, e; the two roots\r\nof the median, h;  the ulnar, f; the musculo-spiral, g; the circumflex,\r\ni; close to which are seen the origins of the internal cutaneous, the\r\nnerve of Wrisberg, some thoracic branches, and posteriorly the\r\nsubscapular nerve not seen in this view of the parts.\r\n\r\nThe branches which come off from the axillary artery are very variable\r\nboth as to number and place of origin, but in general will be found\r\ncertain branches which answer to the names thoracic, subscapular, and\r\ncircumflex. These vessels, together with numerous smaller arteries,\r\nappear to be confined to no fixed point of origin, and on this account\r\nthe place of election for passing a ligature around the main axillary\r\nartery sufficiently removed from collateral branches must be always\r\ndoubtful. The subscapular artery, Q, Plate 12, is perhaps of all the\r\nother branches that one which manifests the most permanent character;\r\nits point of origin being in general opposite the interval between the\r\nlatissimus and sub-scapular muscles, but I have seen it arise from all\r\nparts of the axillary main trunk. If it be required to give, in a\r\nhistory of the arteries, a full account of all the deviations from the\r\nso-called normal type to which these lesser branches here and elsewhere\r\nare subject, such account can scarcely be said to be called for in this\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nThe form of the axillary space is conical, while the arm is abducted\r\nfrom the side, and while the osseous and muscular structures remain\r\nentire. The apex of the cone is formed at the root of the neck beneath\r\nthe clavicle, R, Plate 11, and the subclavious muscle, E, and between\r\nthe coracoid process, L*, of the scapula and the serratus magnus muscle,\r\nas this lies upon the thoracic side; at this apex the subclavian\r\nvessels, A B, enter the axillary space. The base of the cone is below,\r\nlooking towards the arm, and is formed in front by the pectoralis major,\r\nK H, and behind by the latissimus dorsi, O, and teres muscles, P,\r\ntogether with a dense thick fascia; at this base the axillary vessels, a\r\nb, pass out to the arm, and become the brachial vessels, a*b*. The\r\nanterior side of the cone is formed by the great pectoral muscle, H K,\r\nPlate 11, and the lesser pectoral, L I. The inner side is formed by the\r\nserratus magnus muscle, M, Plate 12, on the side of the thorax; the\r\nexternal side is formed by the scapular and humeral insertion of the\r\nsubscapular muscle, the humerus and coraco-brachialis muscle; and the\r\nposterior side is formed by the latissimus dorsi, the teres and body of\r\nthe subscapular muscle.\r\n\r\nIn this axillary region is contained a complicated mass of bloodvessels,\r\nnerves, and lymphatic glands, surrounded by a large quantity of loose\r\ncellular membrane and adipose tissue. All the arterial branches here\r\nfound are given off from the axillary artery; and the numerous veins\r\nwhich accompany these branches enter the axillary vein. Nerves from\r\nother sources besides those of the axillary plexus traverse the axillary\r\nspace; such nerves, for example, as those named intercosto-humeral, seen\r\nlying on the latissimus tendon, O, Plate 11. The vein named cephalic, S,\r\nenters the axillary space at that cellular interval occurring between\r\nthe clavicular origin of the deltoid muscle, G, and the humeral\r\nattachment of the pectoralis major, H, which interval marks the place of\r\nincision for tying the axillary artery.\r\n\r\nThe general course of the main vessels through the axillary space would\r\nbe indicated with sufficient accuracy by a line drawn from the middle of\r\nthe clavicle, R R, Plate 11, to the inner border of the biceps muscle,\r\nN. In this direction of the axillary vessels, the coracoid process, L*,\r\nfrom which arises the tendon of the pectoralis minor muscle, L, is to be\r\ntaken as a sure guide to the place of the artery, b, which passes, in\r\ngeneral, close to the inner side of this bony process. Even in the\r\nundissected body the coracoid process may be felt as a fixed resisting\r\npoint at that cellular interval between the clavicular attachments of\r\nthe deltoid and great pectoral muscles. Whatever necessity shall require\r\na ligature to be placed around the axillary in preference to the\r\nsubclavian artery, must, of course, be determined by the particular\r\ncase; but certain it is that the main artery, at the place B, a little\r\nabove the clavicle, will always be found freer and more isolated from\r\nits accompanying nerves and vein, and also more easily reached, owing to\r\nits comparatively superficial situation, than when this vessel has\r\nbecome axillary. The incision required to be made, in order to reach the\r\naxillary artery, b, from the forepart, through the skin, both pectoral\r\nmuscles, and different layers of fasciae, must be very deep, especially\r\nin muscular, well-conditioned bodies; and even when the level of the\r\nvessel is gained, it will be found much complicated by its own branches,\r\nsome of which overlie it, as also by the plexus of nerves, D, Plate 12,\r\nwhich embraces it on all sides, while the large axillary vein, a, Plate\r\n11, nearly conceals it in front. This vein in Plate 11 is drawn somewhat\r\napart from the artery.\r\n\r\nSometimes the axillary artery is double, in consequence of its high\r\ndivision into brachial branches. But as this peculiarity of premature\r\ndivision never takes place so high up as where the vessel, B, Plate 11,\r\noverarches the first rib, F, this circumstance should also have some\r\nweight with the operator.\r\n\r\nWhen we view the relative position of the subclavian vessels, A B, Plate\r\n11, to the clavicle, R, we can readily understand why a fracture of the\r\nmiddle of this bone through that arch which it forms over the vessels,\r\nshould interfere with the free circulation of the blood which these\r\nvessels supply to the arm. When the clavicle is severed at its middle,\r\nthe natural arch which the bone forms over the vessels and nerves is\r\nlost, and the free moving broken ends of the bone will be acted on in\r\nopposing directions by the various muscles attached to its sternal and\r\nscapular extremities. The outer fragment follows more freely than the\r\ninner piece the action of the muscles; but, most of all, the weight of\r\nthe unsupported shoulder and arm causes the displacement to which the\r\nouter fragment is liable. The subclavius muscle, E, like the pronator\r\nquadratus muscle of the forearm, serves rather to further the\r\ndisplacement of the broken ends of the bone than to hold them in situ.\r\n\r\nIf the head of the humerus be dislocated forwards beneath L, Plate 11,\r\nthe coracoid attachment of the pectoralis minor muscle, it must press\r\nout of their proper place and put tensely upon the stretch the axillary\r\nvessels and plexus of nerves. So large and resistent a body as the head\r\nof the humerus displaced forwards, and taking the natural position of\r\nthese vessels and nerves, will accordingly be attended with other\r\nsymptoms--such as obstructed circulation and pain or partial paralysis,\r\nbesides those physical signs by which we distinguish the presence of it\r\nas a new body in its abnormal situation.\r\n\r\nWhen the main vessels and nerves pass from the axillary space to the\r\ninner side of the arm, they become comparatively superficial in this\r\nlatter situation. The inner border of the biceps muscle is taken as a\r\nguide to the place of the brachial artery for the whole extent of its\r\ncourse in the arm. In plate 11, the artery, b*, is seen in company with\r\nthe median nerve, which lies on its fore part, and with the veins called\r\ncomites winding round it and passing with it and the nerve beneath the\r\nfascia which encases in a fold of itself all three structures in a\r\ncommon sheath. Though the axillary vein is in close contact with the\r\naxillary artery and nerves, yet the basilic vein, d*, the most\r\nconsiderable of those vessels which form the axillary vein, is separated\r\nfrom the brachial artery by the fascia. The basilic vein, however,\r\noverlies the brachial artery to its inner side, and is most commonly\r\nattended by the internal cutaneous nerve, seen lying upon it in Plate\r\n11, as also by that other cutaneous branch of the brachial plexus, named\r\nthe nerve of Wrisberg. If a longitudinal incision in the course of the\r\nbrachial artery be made (avoiding the basilic vein) through the\r\nintegument down to the fascia of the arm, and the latter structure be\r\nslit open on the director, the artery will be exposed, having the median\r\nnerve lying on its outer side in the upper third of the arm, and passing\r\nto its inner side towards the bend of the elbow, as at b*, Plate 12. The\r\nsuperior and inferior profunda arteries, seen springing above and below\r\nthe point b, Plate 12, are those vessels of most importance which are\r\ngiven off from the brachial artery, but the situation of their origin is\r\nvery various. The ulnar nerve, f, lies close to the inner side of the\r\nmain arterial trunk, as this latter leaves the axilla, but from this\r\nplace to the inner condyle, Q, behind which the ulnar nerve passes into\r\nthe forearm, the nerve and artery become gradually more and more\r\nseparated from each other in their descent. The musculo-spiral nerve, g,\r\nwinds under the brachial artery at the middle of the arm, but as this\r\nnerve passes deep between the short and long heads of the triceps\r\nmuscle, P, and behind the humerus to gain the outer aspect of the limb,\r\na little care will suffice for avoiding the inclusion of it in the\r\nligature.\r\n\r\nThe brachial artery may be so effectually compressed by the fingers on\r\nthe tourniquet, against the humerus in any part of its course through\r\nthe arm, as to stop pulsation at the wrist.\r\n\r\nThe tourniquet is a less manageable and not more certain compressor of\r\nthe arterial trunk than is the hand of an intelligent assistant. At\r\nevery region of the course of an artery where the tourniquet is\r\napplicable, a sufficient compression by the hand is also attainable with\r\ngreater ease to the patient; and the hand may compress the vessel at\r\ncertain regions where the tourniquet would be of little or no use, or\r\nattended with inconvenience, as in the locality of the subclavian\r\nartery, passing over the first rib, or the femoral artery, passing over\r\nthe pubic bone, or the carotid vessels in the neighbourhood of the\r\ntrachea, as they lie on the fore part of the cervical spinal column.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 11 & 12.\r\n\r\nPLATE 11.\r\n\r\nA.

Though the male and\r\nfemale bodies, in all their regions, are anatomically homologous or\r\nsimilar at basis, yet the constituent and corresponding organs of each\r\nare gently diversified by the plus or minus condition, the more or the\r\nless, which the development of certain organs exhibits; and this\r\ndiversity, viewed in the aggregate, constitutes the sexual difference.\r\nThat diversity which defines the sexual character of beings of the same\r\nspecies, is but a link in that extended chain of differential gradation\r\nwhich marks its progress through the whole animal kingdom. The female\r\nbreast is a plus glandular organ, situated, pendent, in that very\r\nposition where, in a male body, the unevolved mamma is still\r\nrudimentarily manifested.\r\n\r\nThe male and female axillae contain the same number and species of\r\norgans; and the difference by which the external configuration of both\r\nare marked mainly arises from the presence of the enlarged mammary\r\ngland, which, in the female, Plate 14, masks the natural outline of the\r\npectoral muscle, E, whose axillary border is overhung by the gland; and\r\nthus this region derives its peculiarity of form, contrasted with that\r\nof the male subject.\r\n\r\nWhen the dissected axilla is viewed from below, the arm being raised,\r\nand extended from the side, its contained parts, laid deeply in their\r\nconical recess, are sufficiently exposed, at the same time that the\r\nproper boundaries of the axillary cavity are maintained. In this point\r\nof view from which the axillary vessels are now seen, their relative\r\nposition, in respect to the thorax and the arm, are best displayed. The\r\nthickness of that fleshy anterior boundary formed by both pectoral\r\nmuscles, E F, Plate 13, will be marked as considerable; and the depth at\r\nwhich these muscles conceal the vessels, A B, in the front aspect of the\r\nthoracico-humeral interval, will prepare the surgeon for the\r\ndifficulties he is to encounter when proceeding to ligature the axillary\r\nartery at the incision made through the anterior or pectoral wall of\r\nthis axillary space.\r\n\r\nThe bloodvessels of the axilla follow the motions of the arm; and\r\naccording to the position assumed by the arm, these vessels describe\r\nvarious curves, and lie more or less removed from the side of the\r\nthorax. While the arm hangs close to the side, the axillary space does\r\nnot (properly speaking) exist; and in this position, the axillary\r\nvessels and nerves make a general curve from the clavicle at the point\r\nK, Plate 14, to the inner side of the arm, the concavity of the curve\r\nbeing turned towards the thoracic side. But when the arm is abducted\r\nfrom the side, and elevated, the vessels which are destined to supply\r\nthe limb follow it, and in this position they take, in reality, a\r\nserpentine course; the first curve of which is described, in reference\r\nto the thorax, from the point K to the head of the humerus; and the next\r\nis that bend which the head of the humerus, projecting into the axilla\r\nin the elevated position of the member, forces them to make around\r\nitself in their passage to the inner side of the arm. The vessels may be\r\nreadily compressed against the upper third of the humerus by the finger,\r\npassed into the axilla, and still more effectually if the arm be raised,\r\nas this motion will rotate the tuberous head of the humerus downwards\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nThe vessels and nerves of the axilla are bound together by a fibrous\r\nsheath derived from the membrane called costo-coracoid; and the base or\r\nhumeral outlet of this axillary space, described by the muscles C, K, E,\r\nG, Plate 13, is closed by a part of the fascial membrane, g, extended\r\nacross from the pectoral muscle, E, to the latissimus dorsi tendon, K.\r\nIn the natural position of the vessels at that region of their course\r\nrepresented in the Plates, the vein A overlies the artery B, and also\r\nconceals most of the principal nerves. In order to show some of these\r\nnerves, in contact with the artery itself, the axillary vein is drawn a\r\nlittle apart from them.\r\n\r\nThe axillary space gives lodgment to numerous lymphatic glands, which\r\nare either directly suspended from the main artery, or from its\r\nprincipal branches, by smaller branches, destined to supply them. These\r\nglands are more numerous in the female axilla, Plate 14, than in the\r\nmale, Plate 13, and while they seem to be, as it were, indiscriminately\r\nscattered here and there through this region, we observe the greater\r\nnumber of them to be gathered together along the axillary side of the\r\ngreat pectoral muscle; at which situation, h, in the diseased condition\r\nof the female breast, they will be felt to form hard, nodulated masses,\r\nwhich frequently extend as far up through the axillary space as the root\r\nof the neck, involving the glands of this latter region also in the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe contractile motions of the pectoral muscle, E, of the male body,\r\nPlate 13, are during life readily distinguishable; and that boundary\r\nwhich it furnishes to the axillary region is well defined; but in the\r\nfemale form, Plate 14, the general contour of the muscle E, while in\r\nmotion, is concealed by the hemispherical mammary gland, F, which,\r\nsurrounded by its proper capsule, lies loosely pendent from the fore\r\npart of the muscle, to which, in the healthy state of the organ, it is\r\nconnected only by free-moving bonds of lax cellular membrane. The\r\nmotions of the shoulder upon the trunk do not influence the position of\r\nthe female mammary gland, for the pectoral muscle acts freely beneath\r\nit; but when a scirrhus or other malignant growth involves the mammary\r\norgan, and this latter contracts, by the morbid mass, a close adhesion\r\nto the muscle, then these motions are performed with pain and\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen it is required to excise the diseased female breast, (supposing the\r\ndisease to be confined to the structure of the gland itself,) the\r\noperation may be performed confidently and without difficulty, in so far\r\nas the seat of operation does not involve the immediate presence of any\r\nimportant nerves or bloodvessels. But when the disease has extended to\r\nthe axillary glands, the extirpation of these (as they lie in such close\r\nproximity to the great axillary vessels and their principal branches)\r\nrequires cautious dissection. It has more than once happened to eminent\r\nsurgeons, that in searching for and dissecting out these diseased\r\naxillary glands, H, h, Plate 14, the main artery has been wounded.\r\n\r\nAs the coracoid process points to the situation of the artery in the\r\naxilla, so the coraco-brachialis muscle, C, marks the exact locality of\r\nthe vessel as it emerges from this region; the artery ranges along the\r\ninner margin of both the process and the muscle, which latter, in fleshy\r\nbodies, sometimes overhangs and conceals it. When the vessel has passed\r\nthe insertion of the coraco-brachialis, it becomes situated at the inner\r\nside of the biceps, which also partly overlaps it, as it now lies on the\r\nforepart of the brachialis  anticus. As the general course of the\r\nartery, from where it leaves the axilla to the bend of the elbow, is one\r\nof winding from the inner side to the forepart of the limb, so should\r\ncompression of the vessel, when necessary, be directed in reference to\r\nthe bone accordingly--viz., in the upper or axillary region of the arm,\r\nfrom within outwards, and in the lower part of the arm, from before\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\nAll incised, lacerated, or contused wounds of the arm and shoulder,\r\nhappening by pike, bayonet, sabre, bullet, mace, or arrow, on the outer\r\naspect of the limb, are (provided the weapon has not broken the bones)\r\nless likely to implicate the great arteries, veins, and nerves. These\r\ninstruments encountering the inner or axillary aspect of the member,\r\nwill of course be more likely to involve the vessels and nerves in the\r\nwound. In severe compound fractures of the humerus occurring from force\r\napplied at the external side of the limb, the brachial vessels and\r\nnerves have been occasionally lacerated by the sharp jagged ends of the\r\nbroken bone,--a circumstance which calls for immediate amputation of the\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nThe axilla becomes very frequently the seat of morbid growths, which,\r\nwhen they happen to be situated beneath the dense axillary fascia, and\r\nhave attained to a large size, will press upon the vessels and nerves of\r\nthis region, and cause very great inconvenience. Adipose and other kind\r\nof tumours occurring in the axilla beneath the fascia, and in close\r\ncontact with the main vessels, have been known to obstruct these vessels\r\nto such a degree, as to require the collateral or anastomatic\r\ncirculation to be set up for the support; of the limb. When abscesses\r\ntake place in the axilla, beneath the fascia, it is this structure which\r\nwill prevent the matter from pointing; and it is required, therefore, to\r\nlay this fascia freely open by a timely incision. The accompanying\r\nPlates will indicate the proper direction in which such incision should\r\nbe made, so as to avoid the vessels A, B. When the limb is abducted from\r\nthe side, the main vessels and nerves take their position parallel with\r\nthe axis of the arm. The axillary vessels and nerves being thus liable\r\nto pressure from the presence of large tumours happening in their\r\nneighbourhood, will suggest to the practitioner the necessity for\r\nfashioning of a proper form and size all apparatus, which in fracture or\r\ndislocation of the shoulder-bones shall be required to bear forcibly\r\nagainst the axillary region. While we know that the locality of the main\r\nvessels and nerves is that very situation upon which a pad or fulcrum\r\npresses, when placed in the axilla for securing the reduction of\r\nfractures of the clavicle, the neck of the humerus, or scapula, so\r\nshould this member of the fracture apparatus be adapted, as well to\r\nobviate this pressure upon these structures, as to give the needful\r\nsupport to the limb in reference to the clavicle, &c. The habitual use,\r\nfor weeks or more, of a hard, resisting fulcrum in the axilla, must act\r\nin some degree like the pad of a tourniquet, arresting the flow of a\r\nvigorous circulation, which is so essential to the speedy union of all\r\nlesions of bones. And it should never be lost sight of, that all\r\ngrievously coercive apparatus, which incommode the suffering patient,\r\nunder treatment, are those very instruments which impede the curative\r\nprocess of Nature herself.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical mechanism of the human body, considered as a whole, or\r\ndivisible into regions, forms a study so closely bearing upon practice,\r\nthat the surgeon, if he be not also a mechanician, and fully capable of\r\nmaking his anatomical knowledge suit with the common principles of\r\nmechanics, while devising methods for furthering the efforts, of Nature\r\ncuratively, may be said to have studied anatomy to little or no purpose.\r\nThe shoulder apparatus, when studied through the principle of mechanics,\r\nderives an interest of practical import which all the laboured\r\ndescription of the schools could never supply to it, except when\r\nillustrating this principle.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of the muscular around the osseous elements of the shoulder\r\napparatus, forms a study for the surgeon as well in the abnormal\r\ncondition of these parts, as in their normal arrangement; for in\r\npractice he discovers that that very mechanical principle upon which\r\nboth orders of structures (the osseous and muscular) are grouped\r\ntogether for normal articular action, becomes, when the parts are\r\nderanged by fracture or, other accident, the chief cause whereby\r\nrearrangement is prevented, and the process of reunion obstructed. When\r\na fracture happens in the shaft of the humerus, above or below the\r\ninsertions of the pectoral and latissimus dorsi muscles, these are the\r\nvery agents which when the bone possessed its integrity rendered it\r\nfunctionally fitting, and which, now that the bone is severed, produce\r\nthe displacement of the lower fragment from the upper one. To counteract\r\nthis source of derangement, the surgeon becomes the mechanician, and\r\nnow, for the first time, he recognises the necessity of the study of\r\ntopographical anatomy.\r\n\r\nWhen a bone is fractured, or dislocated to a false position and retained\r\nthere by the muscular force, the surgeon counteracts this force upon\r\nmechanical principle; but while he puts this principle in operation, he\r\nalso acknowledges to the paramount necessity of ministering to the ease\r\nof Nature as much as shall be consistent with the effectual use of the\r\nremedial agent; and in the present state of knowledge, it is owned, that\r\nthat apparatus is most efficient which simply serves both objects, the\r\none no less than the other. And, assuming this to be the principle which\r\nshould always guide us in our treatment of fractures and dislocations, I\r\nshall not hesitate to say, that the pad acting as a fulcrum in the\r\naxilla, or the perineal band bearing as a counterextending force upon\r\nthe groin (the suffering body of the patient being, in both instances,\r\nsubjected for weeks together to the grievous pressure and irritation of\r\nthese members of the apparatus), do not serve both objects, and only one\r\nincompletely; I say incompletely, for out of every six fractures of\r\neither clavicle or thigh-bone, I believe that, as the result of our\r\ntreatment by the present forms of mechanical contrivances, there would\r\nnot be found three cases of coaptation of the broken ends of the bone so\r\ncomplete as to do credit to the surgeon. The most pliant and portable of\r\nall forms of apparatus which constitute the hospital armamentaria, is\r\nthe judgment; and this cannot give its approval to any plan of\r\ninstrument which takes effect only at the expense of the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 13 & 14.\r\n\r\nPLATE 13.\r\n\r\nA.

The limbs\r\nundergo all kinds of mutilation, both by accident and intention, and yet\r\nthe patient survives; but when the like happens at any region of the\r\ntrunk of the body, the life will be directly and seriously threatened.\r\nIt seems, therefore, that in the same degree as the living principle\r\ndiverges from the body's centre into the outstanding members, in that\r\ndegree is the life weakened in intensity; and just as, according to\r\nphysical laws, the ray of light becomes less and less intense by the\r\nsquare of the distance from the central source, so the vital ray, or\r\nvis, loses momentum in the same ratio as it diverges from the common\r\ncentral line to the periphery.\r\n\r\nThe relative anatomy of every surgical region becomes a study of more or\r\nless interest to the surgeon, according to the degree of importance\r\nattaching to the organs contained, or according to the frequency of such\r\naccidents as are liable to occur in each. The bend of the elbow is a\r\nregion of anatomical importance, owing to the fact of its giving passage\r\nto C, Plate 15, the main artery of the limb, and also because in it are\r\nlocated the veins D, B, E, F, which are frequently the subject of\r\noperation. The anatomy of this region becomes, therefore, important;\r\nforasmuch as the operation which is intended to concern the veins alone,\r\nmay also, by accident, include the main arterial vessel which they\r\noverlie. The nerves, which are seen to accompany the veins\r\nsuperficially, as well as that which accompanies the more\r\ndeeply-situated artery, are, for the same reason, required to be known.\r\n\r\nThe course of the brachial artery along the inner border of the biceps\r\nmuscle is comparatively superficial, from the point where it leaves the\r\naxilla to the bend of the elbow. In the whole of this course it is\r\ncovered by the fascia of the arm, which serves to isolate it from the\r\nsuperficial basilic vein, B, and the internal cutaneous nerve, both of\r\nwhich nevertheless overlie the artery. The median nerve, d, Plate 15,\r\naccompanies the artery in its proper sheath, which is a duplication of\r\nthe common fascia; and in this sheath are also situated the venae\r\ncomites, making frequent loops around the artery. The median nerve\r\nitself, D, Plate 16, takes a direct course down the arm; and the\r\ndifferent relative positions which this nerve holds in reference to the\r\nartery, C, at the upper end, the middle, and the lower end of the arm,\r\noccur mainly in consequence of the undulating character of the vessel\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWhen it is required to ligature the artery in the middle of the arm, the\r\nmedian nerve will be found, in general, at its outer side, between it\r\nand the biceps; but as the course of the artery is from the inner side\r\nof the biceps to the middle of the bend of the elbow, so we find it\r\npassing under the nerve to gain this locality, C, Plate 16, where the\r\nmedian nerve, D, then becomes situated at the inner side of the vessel.\r\nThe median nerve, thus found to be differently situated in reference to\r\nthe brachial artery, at the upper, the middle, and the lower part of the\r\narm, is (with these facts always held in memory) taken as the guide to\r\nthat vessel. An incision made of sufficient length (an inch and a half,\r\nmore or less) over the course of the artery, and to the outer side of\r\nthe basilic vein, B, Plate 16, will divide the skin, subcutaneous\r\nadipose membrane, which varies much in thickness in several individuals,\r\nand will next expose the common fascial envelope of the arm. When this\r\nfascia is opened, by dividing it on the director, the artery becomes\r\nexposed; the median nerve is then to be separated from the side of the\r\nvessel by the probe or director, and, with the precaution of not\r\nincluding the venal comites, the ligature may now be passed around the\r\nvessel. In the lower third of the arm it is not likely that the operator\r\nwill encounter the ulnar nerve, and mistake it for the median, since the\r\nformer, d, Plate 16, is considerably removed from the vessel. If the\r\nincision be made precisely in the usual course of the brachial artery,\r\nthe ulnar nerve will not show itself. It will be well, however, to bear\r\nin mind the possible occurrence of some of those anomalies to that\r\nnormal relative position of the artery, the median, and the ulnar nerve,\r\nwhich the accompanying Plates represent.\r\n\r\nThe median nerve, D, Plate 16, is sometimes found to lie beneath the\r\nartery in the middle and lower third of the arm. At other times it is\r\nfound far removed to the inner side of the usual position of the vessel,\r\nand lying in close contact with the ulnar nerve, d. Or the brachial\r\nartery may take this latter position, while the median nerve stands\r\nalone at the position of D, Plate 16. Or both the main artery and the\r\nmedian nerve may course much to the inner side of the biceps muscle, A,\r\nPlate 16, while in the usual situation of the nerve and vessel there is\r\nonly to be found a small arterial branch (the radial), which springs\r\nfrom the brachial, high up in the arm. Or the nerve and vessel may be\r\nlying concealed beneath a slip of the brachialis anticus muscle, E,\r\nPlate 16, in which case no appearance of them will be at all manifested\r\nthrough the usual place of incision made for the ligature of the\r\nbrachial vessel. Or, lastly, there may be found more arteries than the\r\nsingle main brachial appearing at this place in the arm, and such\r\ncondition of a plurality of vessels occurs in consequence of a high\r\ndivision of the brachial artery. Each of these variations from the\r\nnormal type is more or less frequent; and though it certainly is of\r\npractical import to bear them in mind, still, as we never can foretell\r\ntheir occurrence by a superficial examination of the limb, or pronounce\r\nthem to be present till we actually encounter them in operation, it is\r\nonly when we find them that we commence to reason upon the facts; but\r\neven at this crisis the knowledge of their anatomy may prevent a\r\nconfusion of ideas.\r\n\r\nThat generalization of the facts of such anomalies as are liable to\r\noccur to the normal character of the brachial artery, represented in\r\nPlates 15 and 16, which appears to me as being most inclusive of all\r\ntheir various conditions, is this--viz., that the point of division into\r\nradial, ulnar, and interosseous, which F, Plate 16, usually marks, may\r\ntake place at any part of the member between the bend of the elbow and\r\nthe coracoid process in the axillary space.\r\n\r\nAt the bend of the elbow, the brachial artery usually occupies the\r\nmiddle point between e, the inner condyle of the humerus and the\r\nexternal margin of the supinator radii longus muscle, G. The structures\r\nwhich overlie the arterial vessel, C, Plate 16, at this locality,\r\nnumbering them from its own depth to the cutaneous surface, are these--\r\nviz., some adipose cellular membrane envelopes the vessel, as it lies on\r\nE, the brachialis anticus muscle, and between the two accompanying\r\nveins; at the inner side of the artery, but separated from it by a small\r\ninterval occupied by one of the veins, is situated the median nerve d,\r\nPlate 15. Above all three structures is stretched that dense fibrous\r\nband of the fascia, H, Plate 16, which becomes incorporated with the\r\ncommon fascial covering of the forearm. Over this fascial process lies\r\nthe median basilic vein, F B, Plate 15, accompanying which are seen some\r\nbranches of the internal cutaneous nerve. The subcutaneous adipose\r\ntissue and common integument cover these latter. If it be required to\r\nligature the artery at this locality, an incision two inches and a half\r\nin length, made along the course of the vessel, and avoiding the\r\nsuperficial veins, will expose the fascia; and this being next divided\r\non the director, the artery will be exposed resting on the brachialis\r\nanticus, and between the biceps tendon and pronator teres muscle. As\r\nthis latter muscle differs in width in several individuals, sometimes\r\nlying in close contact with the artery, and at other times leaving a\r\nconsiderable interval between the vessel and itself, its outer margin is\r\nnot, therefore, to be taken as a sure guide to the artery. The inner\r\nborder of the biceps indicates much more generally the situation of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nThe bend of the elbow being that locality where the operation of\r\nphlebotomy is generally performed, it is therefore required to take\r\nexact account of the structures which occupy this region, and more\r\nespecially the relation which the superficial veins hold to the deeper\r\nseated artery. In Plate 15, the artery, C, is shown in its situation\r\nbeneath the fascial aponeurosis, which comes off from the tendon of the\r\nbiceps, a portion of which has been cut away; and the venous vessel, F\r\nB, which usually occupies the track of the artery, is pushed a little to\r\nthe inner side. While opening any part of the vessel, F B, which\r\noverlies the artery, it is necessary to proceed with caution, as well\r\nbecause of the fact that between the artery, C, and the vein, F B, the\r\nfascia alone intervenes, as also because the ulnar artery is given off\r\nrather frequently from the main vessel at this situation, and passes\r\nsuperficial to the fascia and flexors of the forearm, to gain its usual\r\nposition at K, Plate 15. I have met with a well marked example of this\r\noccurrence in the living subject.\r\n\r\nThe cephalic vein, D, is accompanied by the external cutaneous nerve,\r\nwhich branches over the fascia on the outer border of the forearm. The\r\nbasilic vein, B, is accompanied by the internal cutaneous nerve, which\r\nbranches in a similar way over the fascia of the inner and fore part of\r\nthe forearm. The numerous branches of both these nerves interlace with\r\nthe superficial veins, and are liable to be cut when these veins are\r\nbeing punctured. Though the median basilic, F, and the basilic vein, B,\r\nare those generally chosen in the performance of the operation of\r\nbleeding, it will be seen, in Plate 15, that their contiguity to the\r\nartery necessarily demands more care and precision in that operation\r\nexecuted upon them, than if D, the cephalic vein, far removed as it is\r\nfrom the course of the artery, were the seat of phlebotomy.\r\n\r\nAs it is required, in order to distend the superficial veins, D, B, F,\r\nthat a band should be passed around the limb at some locality between\r\nthem and the heart, so that they may yield a free flow of blood on\r\npuncture, a moderate pressure will be all that is needful for that end.\r\nIt is a fact worthy of notice, that the excessive pressure of the\r\nligaturing band around the limb at A B, Plate 15, will produce the same\r\neffect upon the veins near F, as if the pressure were defective, for in\r\nthe former case the ligature will obstruct the flow of blood through the\r\nartery; and the vein, F, will hence be undistended by the recurrent\r\nblood, just as when, in the latter case, the ligature, making too feeble\r\na pressure on the vein, B, will not obstruct its current in that degree\r\nnecessary to distend the vessel, F.\r\n\r\nWhichever be the vein chosen for phlebotomy at the bend of the elbow, it\r\nwill be seen, from an examination of Plates 15 and 16, that the opening\r\nmay be made with most advantage according to the longitudinal axis of\r\nthe vessel; for the vessel while being cut open in this direction, is\r\nless likely to swerve from the point of the lancet than if it were to be\r\nincised across, which latter mode is also far more liable to implicate\r\nthe artery. Besides, as the nerves course along the veins from above\r\ndownwards--making, with each other, and with the vessels, but very acute\r\nangles--all incisions made longitudinally in these vessels, will not be\r\nso likely to divide any of these nerves as when the instrument is\r\ndirected to cut crossways.\r\n\r\nThe brachial artery usually divides, at the bend of the elbow, into the\r\nradial, the ulnar, and the interosseous branches. The point F, Plate 16,\r\nis the common place of division, and this will be seen in the Plate to\r\nbe somewhat below the level of the inner condyle, e. From that place,\r\nwhere the radial and ulnar arteries spring, these vessels traverse the\r\nforearm, in general under cover of the muscles and fascia, but\r\noccasionally superficial to both these structures. The radial artery, F\r\nN, Plate 16, takes a comparatively superficial course along the radial\r\nborder of the forearm, and is accompanied, for the upper two-thirds of\r\nits length, by the radial branch of the musculo-spiral nerve, seen in\r\nPlate 16, at the outer side of the vessel. The supinator radii longus\r\nmuscle in general overlaps, with its inner border, both the radial\r\nartery and nerve. At the situation of the radial pulse, I, Plate 15, the\r\nartery is not accompanied by the nerve, for this latter will be seen, in\r\nplate 16, to pass outward, under the tendon of the supinator muscle, to\r\nthe integuments.\r\n\r\nThe ulnar artery, whose origin is seen near F, Plate 16, passes deeply\r\nbeneath the superficial flexor muscles, L M K, and the pronator teres,\r\nI, and first emerges from under cover of these at the point O, from\r\nwhich point to S, Plate 16, the artery may be felt, in the living body,\r\nobscurely beating as the ulnar pulse. On the inner border of the ulnar\r\nartery, and in close connexion with it, the ulnar nerve may be seen\r\nlooped round by small branches of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe radial and ulnar arteries may be exposed and ligatured in any part\r\nof their course; but of the two, the radial vessel can be reached with\r\ngreater facility, owing to its comparatively superficial situation. The\r\ninner border of the supinator muscle, G, Plate 16, is the guide to the\r\nradial artery; and the outer margin of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle,\r\nK, Plate 16, indicates the locality of the ulnar artery. Both arteries,\r\nI, K, Plate 15, at the wrist, lie beneath the fascia. If either of these\r\nvessels require a ligature in this region of the arm, the operation may\r\nbe performed with little trouble, as a simple incision over the track of\r\nthe vessels, through the skin and the fascia, will readily expose each.\r\n\r\nWhenever circumstances may call for placing a ligature on the ulnar\r\nartery, as it lies between the superficial and deep flexor muscles, in\r\nthe region of I L M, Plate 16, the course of the vessel may be indicated\r\nby a line drawn from a central point of the forearm, an inch or so below\r\nthe level of the inner condyle--viz., the point F, and carried to the\r\npisiform bone, T. The line of incision will divide obliquely the\r\nsuperficial flexors; and, on a full exposure of the vessel in this\r\nsituation, the median nerve will be seen to cross the artery at an acute\r\nangle, in order to gain the mid-place in the wrist at Q. The ulnar\r\nnerve, d, Plate 16, passing behind the inner condyle, e, does not come\r\ninto connexion with the ulnar artery until both arrive at the place O.\r\nIt will, however, be considered an awkward proceeding to subject to\r\ntransverse section so large a mass of muscles as the superficial flexors\r\nof the forearm, when the vessel may be more readily reached elsewhere,\r\nand perhaps with equal advantage as to the locality of the ligature.\r\n\r\nWhen either the radial or ulnar arteries happen to be completely divided\r\nin a wound, both ends of the vessel will bleed alike, in consequence of\r\nthe free anastomosis of both arteries in the hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 15 & 16.\r\n\r\nPLATE 15.\r\n\r\nA.

The hand is typical of the mind. It is\r\nthe material symbol of the immaterial spirit, It is the prime agent of\r\nthe will; and it is that instrument by which the human intellect\r\nmanifests its presence in creation. The human hand has a language of its\r\nown. While the tongue demonstrates the thought through the word, the\r\nhand realizes and renders visible the thought through the work. This\r\norgan, therefore, by whose fitness of form the mind declares its own\r\nentity in nature, by the invention and creation of the thing, which is,\r\nas it were, the mind's autograph, claims a high interest in surgical\r\nanatomy; and accordingly the surgeon lays it down as a rule, strictly to\r\nbe observed, that when this beautiful and valuable member happens to be\r\nseriously mutilated, in any of those various accidents to which it is\r\nexposed, the prime consideration should be, not as to the fact of how\r\nmuch of its quantity or parts it can be deprived in operation, but\r\nrather as to how little of its quantity should it be deprived, since no\r\nmechanical ingenuity can fashion an apparatus, capable of supplying the\r\nloss of a finger, or even of one of its joints.\r\n\r\nThe main blood vessels and nerves of the arm traverse the front aspect\r\nof the wrist, and are distributed chiefly to supply the palmar surface\r\nof the hand, since in the palm are to be found a greater variety and\r\nnumber of structures than are met with on the back of the hand. The\r\nradial artery, A, Plate 17, occupies (as its name indicates) the radial\r\nborder of the forepart of the wrist, and the ulnar artery, C, Plate 17,\r\noccupies the ulnar border; both vessels in this region of their course\r\nlie parallel to each other; both are comparatively superficial, but of\r\nthe two, the radial artery is the more superficial and isolated, and\r\nthereby occasions the radial pulse. The anatomical situation of the\r\nradial artery accounts for the fact, why the pulsation of this vessel is\r\nmore easily felt than that of the ulnar artery.\r\n\r\nThe radial vessel, A, Plate 17, at the wrist, is not accompanied by the\r\nradial nerve; for this nerve, C, Plate 19, passes from the side of the\r\nartery, at a position, C, Plate 19, varying from one to two or more\r\ninches above the wrist, to gain the dorsal aspect of the hand. The ulnar\r\nartery, C, Plate 17, is attended by the ulnar nerve, D, in the wrist,\r\nand both these pass in company to the palm. The ulnar nerve, D E, lies\r\non the ulnar border of the artery, and both are in general to be found\r\nranging along the radial side of the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris\r\nmuscle, T, and the pisiform bone, G. The situation of the radial artery\r\nis midway between the flexor carpi radialis tendon, I, and the outer\r\nborder of the radius. The deep veins, called comites, lie in close\r\nconnexion with the radial and ulnar arteries. When it is required to lay\r\nbare the radial or ulnar artery, at the wrist, it will be sufficient for\r\nthat object to make a simple longitudinal incision (an inch or two in\r\nlength) over the course of the vessel A or C, Plate 17, through the\r\nintegument, and this incision will expose the fascia, which forms a\r\ncommon investment for all the structures at this region. When this\r\nfascia has been cautiously slit open on the director, the vessels will\r\ncome into view. The ulnar artery, however, lies somewhat concealed\r\nbetween the adjacent muscles, and in order to bring this vessel fully\r\ninto view, it will be necessary to draw aside the tendon of the flexor\r\nulnaris muscle, T.\r\n\r\nThe radial artery, A, Plate 18, passes external to the radial border of\r\nthe wrist, beneath the extensor tendons, B, of the thumb; and after\r\nwinding round the head of the metacarpal bone of the thumb, as seen at\r\nE, Plate 19, forms the deep palmar arch E, Plate 18. This deep palmar\r\narch lies close upon the forepart of the carpo-metacarpal joints; it\r\nsends off branches to supply the deeply situated muscles, and other\r\nstructures of the palm; and from it are also derived other branches,\r\nwhich pierce the interosseal spaces, and appear on the back of the hand,\r\nPlate 19. The deep palmar arch, E, Plate 18, inosculates with a branch\r\nof the ulnar artery, I, Plate 18, whilst its dorsal interosseal\r\nbranches, Plate 19, communicate freely with the dorsal carpal arch,\r\nwhich is formed by a branch of the radial artery E, Plate 19, and the\r\nterminal branch of the posterior interosseous vessel.\r\n\r\nThe ulnar artery, C, Plate 17, holds a direct and superficial course,\r\nfrom the ulnar border of the forearm through the wrist; and still\r\nremains superficial in the palm, where it forms the superficial palmar\r\narch, F. From this arch arise three or four branches of considerable\r\nsize, which are destined to supply the fingers. A little above the\r\ninterdigital clefts, each of these digital arteries divides into two\r\nbranches, which pass along the adjacent sides of two fingers--a mode of\r\ndistribution which also characterises the digital branches of the\r\nmedian, b b, and ulnar nerves, e e. The superficial palmar arch of the\r\nulnar vessel anastomoses with the deep arch of the radial vessel. The\r\nprincipal points of communication are, first, by the branch, (ramus\r\nprofundus,) I, Plate 18, which passes between the muscles of the little\r\nfinger to join the deep arch beneath the long flexor tendons. 2nd, by\r\nthe branch (superficialis volae) which springs from the radial artery,\r\nA, Plate 17, and crosses the muscles of the ball of the thumb, to join\r\nthe terminal branch of the superficial arch, F, Plate 17. 3rd, by\r\nanother terminal branch of the superficial arch, which joins the\r\narteries of the thumb, derived from the radial vessel, as seen at e,\r\nPlate 18.\r\n\r\nThe frequent anastomosis thus seen to take place between the branches of\r\nthe radial, the ulnar, and the interosseous arteries in the hand, should\r\nbe carefully borne in mind by the surgeon. The continuity of the three\r\nvessels by anastomosis, renders it very difficult to arrest a\r\nhaemorrhage occasioned by a wound of either of them. It will be at once\r\nseen, that when a haemorrhage takes place from any of these larger\r\nvessels of the hand, the bleeding will not be commanded by the\r\napplication of a ligature to either the radial, the ulnar, or the\r\ninterosseous arteries in the forearm; and for this plain reason, viz.,\r\nthat though in the arm these arteries are separate, in the hand their\r\ncommunication renders them as one.\r\n\r\nIf a haemorrhage therefore take place from either of the palmar vessels,\r\nit will not be sufficient to place a ligature around the radial or the\r\nulnar artery singly, for if F, Plate 17, bleeds, and in order to arrest\r\nthat bleeding we tie the vessel C, Plate 17, still the vessel F will\r\ncontinue to bleed, in consequence of its communication with the vessel\r\nE, Plate 18, by the branch 1, Plate 18, and other branches above\r\nmentioned. If E, Plate 18, bleeds, a ligature applied to the vessel A,\r\nPlate 18, will not stop the flow of blood, because of the fact that E\r\nanastomoses with G, by the branch I and other branches, as seen in\r\nPlates 17 and 19.\r\n\r\nAny considerable haemorrhage, therefore, which may be caused by a wound\r\nof the superficial or deep palmar arches, or their branches, and which\r\nwe are unable to arrest by compression, applied directly to the patent\r\norifices of the vessel, will in general require that a ligature be\r\napplied to both the radial and ulnar arteries at the wrist; and it\r\noccasionally happens that even this proceeding will not stop the flow of\r\nblood, for the interosseous arteries, which also communicate with the\r\nvessels of the hand, may still maintain the current of circulation\r\nthrough them. These interosseous arteries being branches of the ulnar\r\nartery, and being given off from the vessel at the bend of the elbow, if\r\nthe bleeding be still kept up from the vessel wounded in the hand, after\r\nthe ligature of the ulnar and radial arteries is accomplished, are in\r\nall probability the channels of communication, and in this case the\r\nbrachial artery must be tied. A consideration of the above mentioned\r\nfacts, proper to the normal distribution of the vessels of the upper\r\nextremity, will explain to the practitioner the cause of the difficulty\r\nwhich occasionally presents itself, as to the arrest of haemorrhage from\r\nthe vessels of the hand. In addition to these facts he will do well to\r\nremember some other arrangements of these vessels, which are liable to\r\noccur; and upon these I shall offer a few observations.\r\n\r\nWhile I view the normal disposition of the arteries of the arm as a\r\nwhole, (and this view of the whole great fact is no doubt necessary, if\r\nwe would take within the span and compass of the reason, all the lesser\r\nfacts of which the whole is inclusive,) I find that as one main vessel\r\n(the brachial) divides into three lesser branches, (the ulnar, radial\r\nand interosseous,) so, therefore, when either of these three supplies\r\nthe haemorrhage, and any difficulty arises preventing our having access\r\nat once to the open orifices of the wounded vessel, we can command the\r\nflow of blood by applying a ligature to the main trunk--the brachial. If\r\nthis measure fail to command the bleeding, then we may conclude that the\r\nwounded vessel (whichever it happen to be, whether the radial, the\r\nulnar, or the interosseous) arises from the brachial artery, higher up\r\nin the arm than that place whereat we applied the ligature. To this\r\nvariety as to the place of origin, the ulnar, radial, and interosseous\r\narteries are individually liable.\r\n\r\nAgain, as the single brachial artery divides into the three arteries of\r\nthe forearm, and as these latter again unite into what may (practically\r\nspeaking) be termed a single vessel in the hand, in consequence of their\r\nanastomosis, so it is obvious that in order to command a bleeding from\r\nany of the palmar arteries, we should apply a ligature upon each of the\r\nvessels of the forearm, or upon the single main vessel in the arm. When\r\nthe former proceeding fails, we have recourse to the latter, and when\r\nthis latter fails (for fail it will, sometimes,) we then reasonably\r\narrive at the conclusion that some one of the three vessels of the\r\nforearm, springs higher up than the place of the ligature on the main\r\nbrachial vessel.\r\n\r\nBut however varied as to the normal locality of their origin, at the\r\nbend of the elbow, these vessels of the forearm may at times manifest\r\nthemselves, still one point is quite fixed and certain, viz., that they\r\ncommunicate with each other in the hand. Hence, therefore, it becomes\r\nevident, that in order to command, at once and effectually, a bleeding,\r\neither from the palmar arteries, or those of the forearm, we attain to a\r\nmore sure and successful result, the nearer we approach the\r\nfountain-head and place a ligature on it--the brachial artery. It is\r\ntrue that to stop the circulation through the main vessel of the limb,\r\nis always attended with danger, and that such a proceeding is never to\r\nbe adopted but as the lesser one of two great hazards. It is also true\r\nthat to tie the main brachial artery for a haemorrhage of anyone of its\r\nterminal branches, may be doing too much, while a milder course may\r\nserve; or else that even our tying the brachial may not suffice, owing\r\nto a high distribution of the vessels of the arm, in the axilla, above\r\nthe place of the ligature. Thus doubt as to the safest measure, viz.,\r\nthat which is sufficient and no more, enveils the proper place whereat\r\nto apply a ligature on the principal vessel; but whatever be the doubt\r\nas to this particular, there can be none attending the following rule of\r\nconduct, viz., that in all cases of haemorrhage, caused by wounds of the\r\nvessels of the upper limb, we should, if at all practicable, endeavour\r\nto stop the flow of blood from the divided vessels in the wound itself,\r\nby ligature or otherwise; and both ends of the divided vessel require to\r\nbe tied. Whenever this may be done, we need not trouble ourselves\r\nconcerning the anomaly in vascular distribution.\r\n\r\nThe superficial palmar arch, F, Plate 17, lies beneath the dense palmar\r\nfascia; and whenever matter happens to be pent up by this fascia, and it\r\nis necessary that an opening be made for its exit, the incision should\r\nbe conducted at a distance from the locality of the vessel. When matter\r\nforms beneath the palmar fascia, it is liable, owing to the unyielding\r\nnature of this fibrous structure, to burrow upwards into the forearm,\r\nbeneath the annular ligament D, Plates 17 and 18. All deep incisions\r\nmade in the median line of the forepart of the wrist are liable to wound\r\nthe median nerve B, Plate 17. When the thumb, together with its\r\nmetacarpal bone, is being amputated, the radial artery E, Plate 19,\r\nwhich winds round near the head of that bone, may be wounded. It is\r\npossible, by careful dissection, to perform this operation without\r\ndividing the radial vessel.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 17, 18, & 19.\r\n\r\nPLATE 17.\r\n\r\nA.

To this\r\nanatomical fact I shall not make any further allusions, except in so far\r\nas the acknowledgment of it shall serve to illustrate some points of\r\nsurgical import.\r\n\r\nThe cranial chamber, A A H, Plate 20, is continuous with the spinal\r\ncanal C. The osseous envelope of the brain, called calvarium, Z B, holds\r\nserial order with the cervical spinous processes, E I, and these with\r\nthe dorsal spinous processes. The dura-matral lining membrane, A A A*,\r\nof the cranial chamber is continuous with the lining membrane, C, of the\r\nspinal canal. The brain is continuous with the spinal cord. The\r\nintervertebral foramina of the cervical spine are manifesting serial\r\norder with the cranial foramina. The nerves which pass through the\r\nspinal region of this series of foramina above and below C are\r\ncontinuous with the nerves which pass through the cranial region. The\r\nanterior boundary, D I, of the cervical spine is continuous with the\r\nanterior boundary, Y F, of the cranial cavity. And this common serial\r\norder of osseous parts--viz., the bodies of vertebrae, serves to\r\nisolate the cranio-spinal compartment from the facial and cervical\r\npassages. Thus the anterior boundary, Y F D I, of the cranio-spinal\r\ncanal is also the posterior boundary of the facial and cervical\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nNow as the cranio-spinal chamber is lined by the common dura-matral\r\nmembrane, and contains the common mass of nervous structure, thus\r\ninviting us to fix attention upon this structure as a whole, so we find\r\nthat the frontal cavity, Z, the nasal cavity, X W, the oral cavity, 4,\r\n5, S, the pharyngeal and oesophageal passages 8 Q, are lined by the\r\ncommon mucous membrane, and communicate so freely with each other that\r\nthey may be in fact considered as forming a common cavity divided only\r\nby partially formed septa, such as the one, U V, which separates to some\r\nextent the nasal fossa from the oral fossa.\r\n\r\nAs owing to this continuity of structure, visible between the head and\r\nspine, we may infer the liability which the affections of the one region\r\nhave to pass into and implicate the other, so likewise by that\r\ncontinuity apparent between all compartments of the face, fauces,\r\noesophagus, and larynx, we may estimate how the pathological condition\r\nof the one region will concern the others.\r\n\r\nThe cranium, owing to its comparatively superficial and undefended\r\ncondition, is liable to fracture. When the cranium is fractured, in\r\nconsequence of force applied to its anterior or posterior surfaces, A or\r\nB, Plate 20, the fracture will, for the most part, be confined to the\r\nplace whereat the force has been applied, provided the point opposite\r\nhas not been driven against some resisting body at the same time. Thus\r\nwhen the point B is struck by a force sufficient to fracture the bone,\r\nwhile the point A is not opposed to any resisting body, then B alone\r\nwill yield to the force applied; and fracture thus occurring at the\r\npoint B, will have happened at the place where the applied force is met\r\nby the force, or weight, or inertia of the head itself. But when B is\r\nstruck by any ponderous body, while A is at the same moment forced\r\nagainst a resisting body, then A is also liable to suffer fracture. If\r\nfracture in one place be attended with counter-fracture in another\r\nplace, as at the opposite points A and B, then the fracture occurs from\r\nthe force impelling, while the counter-fracture happens by the force\r\nresisting.\r\n\r\nNow in the various motions which the cranium A A B performs upon the top\r\nof the cervical spine C, motions backwards, forwards, and to either\r\nside, it will follow that, taking C as a fixed point, almost all parts\r\nof the cranial periphery will be brought vertical to C in succession,\r\nand therefore whichever point happens at the moment to stand opposite to\r\nC, and has impelling force applied to it, then C becomes the point of\r\nresistance, and thus counter-fractures at the cranial base occur in the\r\nneighbourhood of C. When force is applied to the cranial vertex, whilst\r\nthe body is in the erect posture, the top of the cervical spine, E D C,\r\nbecomes the point of resistance. Or if the body fall from a height upon\r\nits cranial vertex, then the propelling force will take effect at the\r\njunction of the spine with the cranial base, whilst the resisting force\r\nwill be the ground upon which the vertex strikes. In either case the\r\ncranial base, as well as the vertex, will be liable to fracture.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical form of the cranium is such as to obviate a frequent\r\nliability to fracture. Its rounded shape diffuses, as is the case with\r\nall rotund forms, the force which happens to strike upon it. The mode in\r\nwhich the cranium is set upon the cervical spine serves also to diffuse\r\nthe pressure at the points where the two opposing forces meet--viz., at\r\nthe first cervical vertebra E and the cranial basilar process F. This\r\nfact might be proved upon mechanical principle.\r\n\r\nThe tegumentary envelope of the head, as well as the dura-matral lining,\r\nserves to damp cranial vibration consequent upon concussion; while the\r\nsutural isolation of the several component bones of the cranium also\r\nprevents, in some degree, the extension of fractures and the vibrations\r\nof concussion. The contents of the head, like the contents of all hollow\r\nforms, receive the vibratory influence of force externally applied. The\r\nbrain receives the concussion of the force applied to its osseous\r\nenvelope; and when this latter happens to be fractured, the danger to\r\nlife is not in proportion to the extent of the fracture here, any more\r\nthan elsewhere in the skeleton fabric, but is solely in proportion to\r\nthe amount of shock or injury sustained by the nervous centre.\r\n\r\nWhen it is required to trephine any part of the cranial envelope, the\r\npoints which should be avoided, as being in the neighbourhood of\r\nimportant bloodvessels, are the following--the occipital protuberance,\r\nB, within which the \"torcular Herophili\" is situated, and from this\r\npoint passing through the median line of the vertex forwards to Z the\r\nfrontal sinus, the trephine should not be applied, as this line marks\r\nthe locality of the superior longitudinal sinus. The great lateral sinus\r\nis marked by the superior occipital ridge passing from the point B\r\noutwards to the mastoid process. The central point B of the side of the\r\nhead, Plate 21, marks the locality of the root of the meningeal artery\r\nwithin the cranium, and from this point the vessel branches forwards and\r\nbackwards over the interior of the cranium.\r\n\r\nThe nasal fossae are situated on either side of the median partition\r\nformed by the vomer and cartilaginous nasal septum. Both nasal fossae\r\nare open anteriorly and posteriorly; but laterally they do not, in the\r\nnormal state of these parts, communicate. The two posterior nares\r\nanswering to the two nasal fossae open into the upper part of the bag of\r\nthe pharynx at 8, Plate 20, which marks the opening of the Eustachian\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nThe structures observable in both the nasal fossae absolutely\r\ncorrespond, and the foramina which open into each correspond likewise.\r\nAll structures situated on either side of the median line are similar.\r\nAnd the structure which occupies the median line is itself double, or\r\nduality fused into symmetrical unity. The osseous nasal septum is\r\ncomposed of two laminae laid side by side. The spongy bones, X W, are\r\nattached to the outer wall of the nasal fossa, and are situated one\r\nabove the other. These bones are three in number, the uppermost is the\r\nsmallest. The outer wall of each naris is grooved by three fossae,\r\ncalled meatuses, and these are situated between the spongy bones. Each\r\nmeatus receives one or more openings of various canals and cavities of\r\nthe facial apparatus. The sphenoidal sinus near F opens into the upper\r\nmeatus. The frontal, Z, and maxillary sinuses open into the middle\r\nmeatus, and the nasal duct opens into the inferior sinus beneath the\r\nanterior inferior angle of the lower spongy bone, W.\r\n\r\nIn the living body the very vascular fleshy and glandular Schneiderian\r\nmembrane which lines all parts of the nasal fossa almost completely\r\nfills this cavity. When polypi or other growths occupy the nasal fossae,\r\nthey must gain room at the expense of neighbouring parts. The nasal duct\r\nmay have a bent probe introduced into it by passing the instrument along\r\nthe outer side of the floor of the nasal fossa as far back as the\r\nanterior inferior angle of the lower spongy bone, W, at which locality\r\nthe duct opens. An instrument of sufficient length, when introduced into\r\nthe nostrils in the same direction, will, if passed backwards through\r\nthe posterior nares, reach the opening of the Eustachian tube, 8.\r\n\r\nWhile the jaws are closed, the tongue, R, Plate 20, occupies the oral\r\ncavity almost completely. When the jaws are opened they form a cavity\r\nbetween them equal in capacity to the degree at which they are sundered\r\nfrom each other. The back of the pharynx can be seen when the jaws are\r\nwidely opened if the tongue be depressed, as R, Plate 20. The hard\r\npalate, U, which forms the roof of the mouth, is extended further\r\nbackwards by the soft palate, V, which hangs as the loose velum of the\r\nthroat between the nasal fossae above and the fauces below. Between the\r\nvelum palati, V, and the root of the tongue, we may readily discern,\r\nwhen the jaws are open, two ridges of arching form, 5, 6, on either side\r\nof the fauces. These prominent arches and their fellows are named the\r\npillars of the fauces. The anterior pillar, 5, is formed by the\r\nsubmucous palato-glossus muscle; the posterior pillar, 6, is formed by\r\nthe palato-pharyngeus muscle. Between these pillars, 5 and 6, is\r\nsituated the tonsil, S, beneath the mucous membrane. When the tonsils of\r\nopposite sides become inflamed and suppurate, an incision may be made\r\ninto either gland without much chance of wounding the internal carotid\r\nartery; for, in fact, this vessel lies somewhat removed from it behind.\r\nIn Plate 21, that point of the superior constrictor of the pharynx,\r\nmarked D, indicates the situation of the tonsil gland; and a\r\nconsiderable interval will be seen to exist between D and the internal\r\ncarotid vessel F.\r\n\r\nIf the head be thrown backwards the nasal and oral cavities will look\r\nalmost vertically towards the pharyngeal pouch. When the juggler is\r\nabout to \"swallow the sword,\" he throws the head back so as to bring the\r\nmouth and fauces in a straight line with the pharynx and oesophagus. And\r\nwhen the surgeon passes the probang or other instruments into the\r\noesophagus, he finds it necessary to give the head of the person on whom\r\nhe operates the same inclination backwards. When instruments are being\r\npassed into the oesophagus through the nasal fossa, they are not so\r\nlikely to encounter the rima glottidis below the epiglottis, 9, as when\r\nthey are being passed into the oesophagus by the mouth. The glottis may\r\nbe always avoided by keeping the point of the instrument pressing\r\nagainst the back of the pharynx during its passage downwards.\r\n\r\nWhen in suspended animation we endeavour to inflate the lungs through\r\nthe nose or mouth, we should press the larynx, 10, 11,12, backwards\r\nagainst the vertebral column, so as to close the oesophageal tube.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 20 & 21.\r\n\r\nPLATE 20.\r\n\r\nA A.

We cannot, while we contemplate this skeleton, isolate the\r\none region from the other by fact or fancy. The only difference which I\r\ncan discover between the regions called thorax and abdomen, in the\r\nosseous skeleton, (considering this body morphologically,) results,\r\nsimply, from the circumstance that the ribs, which enclose thoracic\r\nspace, have no osseous counterparts in the abdomen enclosing abdominal\r\nspace, and this difference is merely histological. In man and the\r\nmammalia the costal arches hold relation with the pulmonary organs, and\r\nthese costae fail at that region where the ventral organs are located.\r\nIn birds, and many reptiles, the costal arches enclose the common\r\nthoracico-abdominal region, as if it were a common pulmonary region. In\r\nfishes the costal arches enclose the thoracico-abdominal region, just as\r\nif it were a common abdominal region. I merely mention these general\r\nfacts to show that costal enclosure does not actually serve to isolate\r\nthe thorax from the abdomen in the lower classes of animals; and on\r\nturning to the human form, I find that this line of separation between\r\nthe two compartments is so very indefinite, that, as pathologists, we\r\nare very liable to err in our diagnosis between the diseased and the\r\nhealthy organs of either region, as they lie in relation with the\r\nmoveable diaphragm or septum in the living body. The contents of the\r\nwhole trunk of the body from the top of the sternum to the perineum are\r\ninfluenced by the respiratory motions; and it is most true that the\r\ndiaphragmatic line, H F H*, is alternately occupied by those organs\r\nsituated immediately above and below it during the performance of these\r\nmotions, even in health.\r\n\r\nThe organs of the thoracic region hold a certain relation to each other\r\nand to the thoracic walls. The organs of the abdomen hold likewise a\r\ncertain relation to each other and to the abdominal parietes. The organs\r\nof both the thorax and the abdomen have a certain relation to each\r\nother, as they lie above and below the diaphragm. In dead nature these\r\nrelations are fixed and readily ascertainable, but in living, moving\r\nnature, the organs influence this relative position, not only of each\r\nother, but also of that which they bear to the cavities in which they\r\nare contained. This change of place among the organs occurs in the\r\nnormal or healthy state of the living body, and, doubtless, raises some\r\ndifficulty in the way of our ascertaining, with mathematical precision,\r\nthe actual state of the parts which we question, by the physical signs\r\nof percussion and auscultation. In disease this change of place among\r\nthese organs is increased, and the difficulty of making a correct\r\ndiagnosis is increased also in the same ratio. For when an emphysematous\r\nlung shall fully occupy the right thoracic side from B to L, then G, the\r\nliver, will protrude considerably into the abdomen beneath the right\r\nasternal ribs, and yet will not be therefore proof positive that the\r\nliver is diseased and abnormally enlarged. Whereas, on the other hand,\r\nwhen G, the liver, is actually diseased, it may occupy a situation in\r\nthe right side as high as the fifth or sixth ribs, pushing the right\r\nlung upwards as high as that level; and, therefore, while percussion\r\nelicits a dull sound over this place thus occupied, such sound will not\r\nbe owing to a hepatized lung, but to the absence of the lung caused by\r\nthe presence of the liver.\r\n\r\nIn the healthy adult male body, Plate 22, the two lungs, D D*, whilst in\r\ntheir ordinary expanded state, may be said to range over all that region\r\nof the trunk of the body which is marked by the sternal and asternal\r\nribs. The heart, E, occupies the thoracic centre, and part of the left\r\nthoracic side. The heart is almost completely enveloped in the two\r\nlungs. The only portion of the heart and pericardium, which appears\r\nuncovered by the lung on opening the thorax, is the base of the right\r\nventricle, E, situated immediately behind the lower end of the sternum,\r\nwhere this bone is joined by the cartilages of the sixth and seventh\r\nribs. The lungs range perpendicularly from points an inch above B, the\r\nfirst rib, downwards to L, the tenth rib, and obliquely downwards and\r\nbackwards to the vertebral ends of the last ribs. This space varies in\r\ncapacity, according to the degree in which the lungs are expanded within\r\nit. The increase in thoracic space is attained, laterally, by the\r\nexpansion of the ribs, C I; and vertically, by the descent of the\r\ndiaphragm, H, which forces downwards the mass of abdominal viscera. The\r\ncontraction of thoracic space is caused by the approximation of all the\r\nribs on each side to each other; and by the ascent of the diaphragm. The\r\nexpansion of the lungs around the heart would compress this organ, were\r\nit not that the costal sides yield laterally while the diaphragm itself\r\ndescends. The heart follows the ascent and descent of the diaphragm,\r\nboth in ordinary and forced respiration.\r\n\r\nBut however much the lungs vary in capacity, or the heart as to position\r\nin the respiratory motions, still the lungs are always closely applied\r\nto the thoracic walls. Between the pleura costalis and pulmonalis there\r\noccurs no interval in health. The thoracic parietes expand and contract\r\nto a certain degree; and to that same degree, and no further, do the\r\nlungs within the thorax expand and contract. By no effort of expiration\r\ncan the animal expel all the air completely from its lungs, since by no\r\neffort of its own, can it contract thoracic space beyond the natural\r\nlimit. On the other hand, the utmost degree of expansion of which the\r\nlungs are capable, exactly equals that degree in which the thoracic\r\nwalls are dilatable by the muscular effort; and, therefore, between the\r\nextremes of inspiration and expiration, the lungs still hold closely\r\napplied to the costal parietes. The air within the lungs is separated\r\nfrom the air external to the thorax, by the thoracic parietes. The air\r\nwithin and external to the lungs communicate at the open glottis. When\r\nthe glottis closes and cuts off the communication, the respiratory act\r\nceases--the lungs become immovable, and the thoracic walls are (so far\r\nas the motions of respiration are concerned) rendered immovable also.\r\nThe muscles of respiration cannot, therefore, produce a vacuum between\r\nthe pulmonic and costal pleura, either while the external air has or has\r\nnot access to the lungs. Upon this fact the mechanism of respiration\r\nmainly depends; and we may see a still further proof of this in the\r\ncircumstance that, when the thoracic parietes are pierced, so as to let\r\nthe external air into the cavity of the pleura, the lung collapses and\r\nthe thoracic side ceases to exert an expansile influence over the lung.\r\nWhen in cases of fracture of the rib the lung is wounded, and the air of\r\nthe lung enters the pleura, the same effect is produced as when the\r\nexternal air was admitted through an opening in the side.\r\n\r\nWhen serous or purulent effusion takes place within the cavity of the\r\npleura, the capacity of the lung becomes lessened according to the\r\nquantity of the effusion. It is more reasonable to expect that the soft\r\ntissue of the lung should yield to the quantity of fluid within the\r\npleural cavity, than that the rigid costal walls should give way\r\noutwardly; and, therefore, it seldom happens that the practitioner can\r\ndiscover by the eye any strongly-marked difference between the thoracic\r\nwalls externally, even when a considerable quantity of either serum,\r\npus, or air, occupies the pleural sacs.\r\n\r\nIn the healthy state of the thoracic organs, a sound characteristic of\r\nthe presence of the lung adjacent to the walls of the thorax may be\r\nelicited by percussion, or heard during the respiratory act through the\r\nstethoscope, over all that costal space ranging anteriorly between B,\r\nthe first rib, and I K, the eight and ninth ribs. The respiratory murmur\r\ncan be heard below the level of these ribs posteriorly, for the lung\r\ndescends behind the arching diaphragm as far as the eleventh rib.\r\n\r\nWhen fluid is effused into the pleural cavity, the ribs are not moved by\r\nthe intercostal muscles opposite the place occupied by the fluid, for\r\nthis has separated the lung from the ribs. The fluid has compressed the\r\nlung; and in the same ratio as the lung is prevented from expanding, the\r\nribs become less moveable. The presence of fluid in the pleural sac is\r\ndiscoverable by dulness on percussion, and, as might be expected, by the\r\nabsence of the respiratory murmur at that locality which the fluid\r\noccupies. Fluid, when effused into the pleural sac, will of course\r\ngravitate; and its position will vary according to the position of the\r\npatient. The sitting or standing posture will therefore suit best for\r\nthe examination of the thorax in reference to the presence of fluid.\r\n\r\nThough the lungs are closely applied to the costal sides at all times in\r\nthe healthy state of these organs, still they slide freely within the\r\nthorax during the respiratory motions--forwards and backwards--over the\r\nserous pericardium, E, and upwards and downwards along the pleura\r\ncostalis. The length of the adhesions which supervene upon pleuritis\r\ngives evidence of the extent of these motions. When the lung becomes in\r\npart solidified and impervious to the inspired air, the motions of the\r\nthoracic parietes opposite to the part are impeded. Between a solidified\r\nlung and one which happens to be compressed by effused fluid it requires\r\nno small experience to distinguish a difference, either by percussion or\r\nthe use of the stethoscope. It is great experience alone that can\r\ndiagnose hydro-pericardium from hypertrophy of the substance of the\r\nheart by either of these means.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic viscera gravitate according to the position of the body.\r\nThe heart in its pericardial envelope sways to either side of the\r\nsternal median line according as the body lies on this or that side. The\r\ntwo lungs must, therefore, be alternately affected as to their capacity\r\naccording as the heart occupies space on either side of the thorax. In\r\nexpiration, the heart, E, is more uncovered by the shelving edges of the\r\nlungs than in inspiration. In pneumothorax of either of the pleural sacs\r\nthe air compresses the lung, pushes the heart from its normal position,\r\nand the space which the air occupies in the pleura yields a clear hollow\r\nsound on percussion, whilst, by the ear or stethoscope applied to a\r\ncorresponding part of the thoracic walls, we discover the absence of the\r\nrespiratory murmur.\r\n\r\nThe transverse diameter of the thoracic cavity varies at different\r\nlevels from above downwards. The diameter which the two first ribs, B\r\nB*, measure, is the least. That which is measured by the two eighth\r\nribs, I I*, is the greatest. The perpendicular depth of the thorax,\r\nmeasured anteriorly, ranges from A, the top of the sternum, to F, the\r\nxyphoid cartilage. Posteriorly, the perpendicular range of the thoracic\r\ncavity measures from the spinous process of the seventh cervical\r\nvertebra above, to the last dorsal spinous process below. In full,\r\ndeep-drawn inspiration in the healthy adult, the ear applied to the\r\nthoracic walls discovers the respiratory murmur over all the space\r\nincluded within the above mentioned bounds. After extreme expiration, if\r\nthe thoracic walls be percussed, this capacity will be found much\r\ndiminished; and the extreme limits of the thoracic space, which during\r\nfull inspiration yielded a clear sound, indicative of the presence of\r\nthe lung, will now, on percussion, manifest a dull sound, in consequence\r\nof the absence of the lung, which has receded from the place previously\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nOwing to the conical form of the thoracic space, the apex of which is\r\nmeasured by the first ribs, B B*, and the basis by I I*, it will be seen\r\nthat if percussion be made directly from before, backwards, over the\r\npectoral masses, R R*, the pulmonic resonance will not be elicited. When\r\nwe raise the arms from the side and percuss the thorax between the folds\r\nof the axillae, where the serratus magnus muscle alone intervenes\r\nbetween the ribs and the skin, the pulmonic sound will answer clearly.\r\n\r\nAt the hypochondriac angles formed between the points F, L, N, on either\r\nside the lungs are absent both in inspiration and expiration.\r\nPercussion, when made over the surface of the angle of the right side,\r\ndiscovers the presence of the liver, G G*. When made over the median\r\nline, and on either side of it above the umbilicus, N, we ascertain the\r\npresence of the stomach, M M*. In the left hypochondriac angle, the\r\nstomach may also be found to occupy this place wholly.\r\n\r\nBeneath the umbilicus, N, and on either side of it as far outwards as\r\nthe lower asternal ribs, K L, thus ranging the abdominal parietes\r\ntransversely, percussion discovers the transverse colon, O, P, O*. The\r\nsmall intestines, S S*, covered by the omentum, P*, occupy the\r\nhypogastric and iliac regions.\r\n\r\nThe organs situated within the thorax give evidence that they are\r\ndeveloped in accordance to the law of symmetry. The lungs form a pair,\r\none placed on either side of the median line. The heart is a double\r\norgan, formed of the right and left heart. The right lung differs from\r\nthe left, inasmuch as we find the former divided into three lobes, while\r\nthe latter has only two. That place which the heart now occupies in the\r\nleft thoracic side is the place where the third or middle lobe of the\r\nleft lung is wanting. In the abdomen we find that most of its organs are\r\nsingle. The liver, stomach, spleen, colon, and small intestine form a\r\nseries of single organs: each of these may be cleft symmetrically. The\r\nkidneys are a pair.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the ribs are bared in the figure Plate 22, marks\r\nexactly the form and transverse capacity of the thoracic walls. The\r\ndiaphragm, H H*, has had a portion of its forepart cut off, to show how\r\nit separates the thin edges of both lungs above from the liver, G, and\r\nthe stomach, M, below. These latter organs, although occupying abdominal\r\nspace, rise to a considerable height behind K L, the asternal ribs, a\r\nfact which should be borne in mind when percussing the walls of the\r\nthorax and abdomen at this region.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 22.\r\n\r\nA.

At an early age,\r\nthe thorax, compared to the abdomen, is less in proportion than it is at\r\nadult age. The digestive organs in early age preponderate considerably\r\nover the respiratory organs; whereas, on the contrary, in the healthy\r\nand well-formed adult, the thoracic cavity and organs of respiration\r\nmanifest a greater relative proportion to the ventral cavity and organs.\r\nAt the adult age, when sexual peculiarities have become fully marked,\r\nthe thoracic organs of the male body predominate over those of the\r\nabdomen, whilst in the female form the ventral organs take precedence as\r\nto development and proportions. This diversity in the relative capacity\r\nof the thorax and abdomen at different stages of development, and also\r\nin persons of different sexes, stamps each individual with\r\ncharacteristic traits of physical conformation; and it is required that\r\nwe should take into our consideration this normal diversity of\r\ncharacter, while conducting our examinations of individuals in reference\r\nto the existence of disease.\r\n\r\nThe heart varies in some measure, not only as to size and weight, but\r\nalso as to position, even in healthy individuals of the same age and\r\nsex. The level at which the heart is in general found to be situated in\r\nthe thorax is that represented in PLATE 23, where the apex points to the\r\nsixth intercostal space on the left side above K, while the arch of the\r\naorta rises to a level with C, the second costal cartilage. In some\r\ninstances, the heart may be found to occupy a much lower position in the\r\nthorax than the one above mentioned, or even a much higher level. The\r\nimpulse of the right ventricle, F, has been noticed occasionally as\r\ncorresponding to a point somewhat above the middle of the sternum and\r\nthe intercostal space between the fourth and fifth left costal\r\ncartilages; while in other instances its beating was observable as low\r\ndown as an inch or more below the xiphoid cartilage, and these\r\nvariations have existed in a state of health.\r\n\r\nPercussion over the region of the heart yields a dull flat sound. The\r\nsound is dullest opposite the right ventricle, F; whilst above and to\r\neither side of this point, where the heart is overlapped by the anterior\r\nshelving edges of both lungs, the sound is modified in consequence of\r\nthe lung's resonant qualities. The heart-sounds, as heard through the\r\nstethoscope, in valvular disease, will, of course, be more distinctly\r\nascertained at the locality of F, the right ventricle, which is\r\nimmediately substernal. While the body lies supine, the heart recedes\r\nfrom the forepart of the chest; and the lungs during inspiration\r\nexpanding around the heart will render its sounds less distinct. In the\r\nerect posture, the heart inclines forwards and approaches the anterior\r\nwall of the thorax. When the heart is hypertrophied, the lungs do not\r\noverlap it to the same extent as when it is of its ordinary size. In the\r\nlatter state, the elastic cushion of the lung muffles the heart's\r\nimpulse. In the former state, the lung is pushed aside by the overgrown\r\nheart, the strong muscular walls of which strike forcibly against the\r\nribs and sternum.\r\n\r\nThe thorax is separated from the abdomen by the moveable diaphragm. The\r\nheart, F E, lies upon the diaphragm, L L*. The liver, M, lies\r\nimmediately beneath the right side of this muscular septum, L*, while\r\nthe bulging cardiac end of the stomach, O, is in close contact with it\r\non the left side, L. As these three organs are attached to the\r\ndiaphragm--the heart by its pericardium, the stomach by the tube of the\r\noesophagus, and the liver by its suspensory ligaments--it must happen\r\nthat the diaphragm while descending and ascending in the motions of\r\ninspiration and expiration will communicate the same alternate motions\r\nto the organs which are connected with it.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary respiration the capacity of the thorax is chiefly affected\r\nby the motions of the diaphragm; and the relative position which this\r\nseptum holds with regard to the thoracic and abdominal chambers will\r\ncause its motions of ascent and descent to influence the capacity of\r\nboth chambers at the same time. When the lungs expand, they follow the\r\ndescent of the diaphragm, which forces the abdominal contents downwards,\r\nand thus what the thorax gains in space the abdomen loses. When the\r\nlungs contract, the diaphragm ascends, and by this act the abdomen gains\r\nthat space which the thorax loses. But the organs of the thoracic cavity\r\nperform a different office in the economy from those of the abdomen. The\r\nair which fills the lungs is soon again expired, whilst the ingesta of\r\nthe abdominal viscera are for a longer period retained; and as the\r\nspace, which by every inspiration the thorax gains from the abdomen,\r\nwould cause inconvenient pressure on the distended organs of this latter\r\ncavity, so we find that to obviate this inconvenience, nature has\r\nconstructed the anterior parietes of the abdomen of yielding material.\r\nThe muscular parietes of the abdomen relax during every inspiration, and\r\nthus this cavity gains that space which it loses by the encroachment of\r\nthe dilating lungs.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical principle upon which the abdominal chamber is\r\nconstructed, enables it to adjust its capacity to such exigence or\r\npressing necessity as its own visceral organs impose on it, from time to\r\ntime; and the relation which the abdominal cavity bears to the thoracic\r\nchamber, enables it also to be compensatory to this latter. When the\r\ninspiratory thorax gains space from the abdomen, or when space is\r\ndemanded for the increasing bulk of the alimentary canal, or for the\r\nenlarging pregnant uterus; or when, in consequence of disease, such as\r\ndropsical accumulation, more room is wanted, then the abdominal chamber\r\nsupplies the demand by the anterior bulge or swell of its expansile\r\nmuscular parietes.\r\n\r\nThe position of the heart itself is affected by the expansion of the\r\nlungs on either side of it. As the expanding lungs force the diaphragm\r\ndownwards, the heart follows it, and all the abdominal viscera yield\r\nplace to the descending thoracic contents. In strong muscular efforts\r\nthe diaphragm plays an important part, for, previously to making forced\r\nefforts, the lungs are distended with air, so as to swell and render\r\nfixed the thoracic walls into which so many powerful muscles of the\r\nshoulders, the neck, back, and abdomen, are inserted; at the same time\r\nthe muscular diaphragm L L*, becomes tense and unbent from its arched\r\nform, thereby contracting abdominal space, which now has no compensation\r\nfor this loss of space, since the abdominal parietes are also rendered\r\nfirm and unyielding. It is at this crisis of muscular effort that the\r\nabdominal viscera become impacted together; and, acting by their own\r\nelasticity against the muscular force, make an exit for themselves\r\nthrough the weakest parts of the abdominal walls, and thus herniae of\r\nvarious kinds are produced. The most common situations of abdominal\r\nherniae are at the inguinal regions, towards which the intestines, T T,\r\nnaturally gravitate; and at these situations the abdominal parietes are\r\nweak and membranous.\r\n\r\nThe contents of a hernial protrusion through the abdominal parietes,\r\ncorrespond in general with those divisions of the intestinal tube, which\r\nnaturally lie adjacent to the part where the rupture has taken place. In\r\nthe umbilical hernia it is either the transverse colon S*, or some part\r\nof the small intestine occupying the median line, or both together, with\r\nsome folds of the omentum, which will be found to form the contents of\r\nthis swelling. When the diaphragm itself sustains a rupture in its left\r\nhalf, the upper portion of the descending colon, S, protrudes through\r\nthe opening. A diaphragmatic hernia has not, so far as I am aware, been\r\nseen to occur in the right side; and this exemption from rupture of the\r\nright half of the diaphragm may be accounted for anatomically, by the\r\nfact that the liver, M, defends the diaphragm at this situation. The\r\nliver occupies the whole depth of the right hypochondrium; and\r\nintervenes between the diaphragm L*, and the right extremity of the\r\ntransverse colon, S**.\r\n\r\nThe contents of a right inguinal hernia consist of the small intestine,\r\nT. The contents of the right crural hernia are formed by either the\r\nsmall intestine, T, or the intestinum caecum, S***. I have seen a few\r\ncases in which the caecum formed the right crural hernia. Examples are\r\nrecorded in which the intestine caecum formed the contents of a right\r\ninguinal hernia. The left inguinal and crural herniae contain most\r\ngenerally the small intestine, T, of the left side.\r\n\r\nThe right lung, I*, is shorter than the left; for the liver, M, raises\r\nthe diaphragm, L, to a higher level within the thorax, on the right\r\nside, than it does on the left. When the liver happens to be diseased\r\nand enlarged, it encroaches still more on thoracic space; but,\r\ndoubtless, judging from the anatomical connexions of the liver, we may\r\nconclude that when it becomes increased in volume it will accommodate\r\nitself as much at the expense of abdominal space. The liver, in its\r\nhealthy state and normal proportions, protrudes for an inch (more or\r\nless) below the margins of the right asternal ribs. The upper or convex\r\nsurface of the liver rises beneath the diaphragm to a level\r\ncorresponding with the seventh or sixth rib, but this position will vary\r\naccording to the descent and ascent of the diaphragm in the respiratory\r\nmovements. The ligaments by which the liver is suspended do not prevent\r\nits full obedience to these motions.\r\n\r\nThe left lung, I, descends to a lower level than the right; and the left\r\ndiaphragm upon which it rests is itself supported by the cardiac end of\r\nthe stomach. When the stomach is distended, it does not even then\r\nmaterially obstruct the expansion of the left lung, or the descent of\r\nthe left diaphragm, for the abdominal walls relax and allow of the\r\nincreasing volume of the stomach to accommodate itself. The spleen, R,\r\nis occasionally subject to an extraordinary increase of bulk; and this\r\norgan, like the enlarged liver and the distended stomach, will, to some\r\nextent, obstruct the movements of the diaphragm in the act of\r\nrespiration, but owing to its free attachments it admits of a change of\r\nplace. The abdominal viscera, one and all, admit of a change of place;\r\nthe peculiar forms of those mesenteric bonds by which they are\r\nsuspended, allow them to glide freely over each other; and this\r\ncircumstance, together with the yielding nature of the abdominal\r\nparietes, allows the thoracic organs to have full and easy play in the\r\nrespiratory movements performed by agency of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of respiration perform with ease so long as the air has\r\naccess to the lungs through the normal passage, viz., the trachea. While\r\nthe principle of the thoracic pneumatic apparatus remains underanged,\r\nthe motor powers perform their functions capably. The physical or\r\npneumatic power acts in obedience to the vital or muscular power, while\r\nboth stand in equilibrium; but the ascendancy of the one over the other\r\nderanges the whole thoracic machine. When the glottis closes by muscular\r\nspasm and excludes the external air, the respiratory muscles cease to\r\nexert a motor power upon the pulmonary cavity; their united efforts\r\ncannot cause a vacuum in thoracic space in opposition to the pressure of\r\nthe external air. When, in addition to the natural opening of the\r\nglottis, a false opening is made in the side at the point K, the air\r\nwithin the lung at I, and external to it in the now open pleural cavity,\r\nwill stand in equilibrio; the lung will collapse as having no muscular\r\npower by which to dilate itself, and the thoracic dilator muscles will\r\ncease to affect the capacity of the lung, so long as by their action in\r\nexpanding the thoracic walls, the air gains access through the side to\r\nthe pleural sac external to the lung.\r\n\r\nWhether the air be admitted into the pleural sac, by an opening made in\r\nthe side from without, or by an opening in the lung itself, the\r\nmechanical principle of the respiratory apparatus will be equally\r\nderanged. Pneumo-thorax will be the result of either lesion; and by the\r\naccumulation of air in the pleura the lung will suffer pressure. This\r\npressure will be permanent so long as the air has no egress from the\r\ncavity of the pleura.\r\n\r\nThe permanent distention of the thoracic cavity, caused by the\r\naccumulation of air in the pleural sac, or by the diffusion of air\r\nthrough the interlobular cellular tissue consequent on a wound of the\r\nlung itself, will equally obstruct the breathing; and though the\r\nsituation of the accumulated air is in fact anatomically different in\r\nboth cases, yet the effect produced is similar. Interlobular pressure\r\nand interpleural pressure result in the same thing, viz., the permanent\r\nretention of the air external to the pulmonary cells, which, in the\r\nformer case, are collapsed individually; and, in the latter case, in the\r\nmass. Though the emphysematous lung is distended to a size equal to the\r\nhealthy lung in deep inspiration, yet we know that emphysematous\r\ndistention, being produced by extrabronchial air accumulation, is, in\r\nfact, obstructive to the respiratory act. The emphysematous lung will,\r\nin the same manner as the distended pleural sac, depress the diaphragm\r\nand render the thoracic muscles inoperative. The foregoing observations\r\nhave been made in reference to the effect of wounds of the thorax, the\r\nproper treatment of which will be obviously suggested by our knowledge\r\nof the state of the contained organs which have suffered lesion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 23.\r\n\r\nA.

These organs being fashioned in\r\naccordance with the law of symmetry, we find them arranged in close\r\nconnexion with the vertebrate centre of the osseous fabric, which is\r\nitself symmetrical. In this symmetrical arrangement of the main organs\r\nof the trunk of the body, a mechanical principle is prominently\r\napparent; for as the centre is the least moveable and most protected\r\nregion of the form, so have these vitally important structures the full\r\nbenefit of this situation. The aortal trunk, G, of the arterial system\r\nis disposed along the median line, as well for its own safety as for the\r\nfitting distribution of those branches which spring symmetrically from\r\neither side of it to supply the lateral regions of the body.\r\n\r\nThe visceral system of bloodvessels is moulded upon the organs which\r\nthey supply. As the thoracic viscera differ in form and functional\r\ncharacter from those of the abdomen, so we find that the arterial\r\nbranches which are supplied by the aorta to each set, differ likewise in\r\nsome degree. In the accompanying figure, which represents the thoracic\r\nand abdominal visceral branches of the aorta taken in their entirety,\r\nthis difference in their arrangement may be readily recognised. In the\r\nthorax, compared with the abdomen, we find that not only do the aortic\r\nbranches differ in form according to the variety of those organs\r\ncontained in either region, but that they differ numerically according\r\nto the number of organs situated in each. The main vessel itself,\r\nhowever, is common to both regions. It is the one thoracico-abdominal\r\nvessel, and this circumstance calls for the comparison, not only of the\r\nseveral parts of the great vessel itself, but of all the branches which\r\nspring from it, and of the various organs which lie in its vicinity in\r\nthe thorax and abdomen, and hence we are invited to the study of these\r\nregions themselves connectedly.\r\n\r\nIn the thorax, the aorta, G G*, is wholly concealed by the lungs in\r\ntheir states both of inspiration and expiration. The first part of the\r\naortic arch, as it springs from the left ventricle of the heart, is the\r\nmost superficial, being almost immediately sub-sternal, and on a level\r\nwith the sternal junctions of the fourth ribs. By applying the ear at\r\nthis locality, the play of the aortic valves may be distinctly heard.\r\nFrom this point the aorta, G, rises and arches from before, backwards,\r\nto the left side of the spine, G*. The arch of the vessel lies more\r\ndeeply between the two lungs than does its ventricular origin. The\r\ndescending thoracic aorta lies still more deeply situated at the left\r\nside of the dorsal spine. At this latter situation it is in immediate\r\ncontact with the posterior thick part of the left lung; whilst on its\r\nright are placed, L, the thoracic duct; I, the oesophagus; K, the vena\r\nazygos, and the vertebral column. In Plate 26 may be seen the relation\r\nwhich the superior vena cava, H, bears to the aortic arch, A.\r\n\r\nIn the span of the aortic arch will be found, H*, the left bronchus,\r\ntogether with the right branch of the pulmonary artery, and the right\r\npulmonary veins. The pneumo-gastric and phrenic nerves descend on either\r\nside of the arch. The left pneumo-gastric nerve winds round beneath the\r\narch at the point where the obliterated ductus arteriosus joins it. See\r\nPlates 12 & 26.\r\n\r\nThe pulmonary artery, B, Plates 1 & 2, lies close upon the fore part,\r\nand conceals the origin, of the systemic aorta. Whenever, therefore, the\r\nsemilunar valves of either the pulmonary artery or the systemic aorta\r\nbecome diseased, it must be extremely difficult to distinguish by the\r\nsounds alone, during life, in which of the two the derangement exists.\r\nThe origins of both vessels being at the fore part of the chest, it is\r\nin this situation, of course, that the state of their valves is to be\r\nexamined. The descending part of the thoracic aorta, G*, being at the\r\nposterior part of the chest, and lying on the vertebral ends of the left\r\nthoracic ribs, will therefore require that we should examine its\r\ncondition in the living body at the dorsal aspect of the thorax. As the\r\narch of the aorta is directed from before backwards--that is, from the\r\nsternum to the spine, it follows that when an aneurism implicates this\r\nregion of the vessel, the exact situation of the tumour must be\r\ndetermined by antero-posterior examination; and we should recollect,\r\nthat though on the fore part of the chest the cartilages of the second\r\nribs, where these join the sternum, mark the level of the aortic arch,\r\non the back of the chest its level is to be taken from the vertebral\r\nends of the third or fourth ribs. This difference is caused by the\r\noblique descent of the ribs from the spine to the sternum. The first and\r\nsecond dorsal vertebrae, with which the first and second ribs\r\narticulate, are considerably above the level of the first and second\r\npieces of the sternum.\r\n\r\nIn a practical point of view, the pulmonary artery possesses but small\r\ninterest for us; and in truth the trunk of the systemic aorta itself may\r\nbe regarded in the same disheartening consideration, forasmuch as when\r\nserious disease attacks either vessel, the \"tree of life\" may be said to\r\nbe lopped at its root.\r\n\r\nWhen an aneurism arises from the aortic arch it implicates those\r\nimportant organs which are gathered together in contact with itself. The\r\naneurismal tumour may press upon and obstruct the bronchi, H H*; the\r\nthoracic duct, L; the oesophagus, I; the superior vena cava, H, Plate\r\n26, or wholly obliterate either of the vagi nerves. The aneurism of the\r\narch of the aorta may cause suffocation in two ways--viz., either by\r\npressing directly on the tracheal tube, or by compressing and irritating\r\nthe vagus nerve, whose recurrent branch will convey the stimulus to the\r\nlaryngeal muscles, and cause spasmodic closure of the glottis. This\r\nanatomical fact also fully accounts for the constant cough which attends\r\nsome forms of aortic aneurism. The pulmonary arteries and veins are also\r\nliable to obstruction from the tumour. This will occur the more\r\ncertainly if the aneurism spring from the right or the inferior side of\r\nthe arch, and if the tumour should not break at an early period, slow\r\nabsorption, caused by pressure of the tumour, may destroy even the\r\nvertebral column, and endanger the spinal nervous centre. If the tumour\r\nspring from the left side or the fore part of the arch, it may in time\r\nforce a passage through the anterior wall of the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe principal branches of the thoracic aorta spring from the upper part\r\nof its arch. The innominate artery, 2, is the first to arise from it;\r\nthe left common carotid, 6, and the left subclavian artery, 5, spring in\r\nsuccession. These vessels being destined for the head and upper limbs,\r\nwe find that the remaining branches of the thoracic aorta are\r\ncomparatively diminutive, and of little surgical interest. The\r\nintercostal arteries occasionally, when wounded, call for the aid of the\r\nsurgeon; these arteries, like all other branches of the aorta, are\r\nlargest at their origin. Where these vessels spring from G, the\r\ndescending thoracic aorta, they present considerable caliber; but at\r\nthis inaccessible situation, they seldom or never call for surgical\r\ninterference. As the intercostal arteries pass outwards, traversing the\r\nintercostal spaces with their accompanying nerves, they diminish in\r\nsize. Each vessel divides at a distance of about two inches, more or\r\nless, from the spine; and the upper larger branch lies under cover of\r\nthe inferior border of the adjacent rib. When it is required to perform\r\nthe operation of paracentesis thoracis, this distribution of the vessel\r\nshould be borne in mind; and also, that the farther from the spine this\r\noperation is performed, the less in size will the vessels be found. The\r\nintercostal artery is sometimes wounded by the fractured end of the rib,\r\nin which case, if the pleura be lacerated, an effusion of blood takes\r\nplace within the thorax, compresses the lung, and obstructs respiration.\r\n\r\nThe thoracic aorta descends along the left side of the spine, as far as\r\nthe last dorsal vertebra, at which situation the pillars of the\r\ndiaphragm overarch the vessel. From this place the aorta passes\r\nobliquely in front of the five lumbar vertebrae, and on arriving\r\nopposite the fourth, it divides into the two common iliac branches. The\r\naorta, for an extent included between these latter boundaries, is named\r\nthe abdominal aorta, and from its fore part arise those branches, which\r\nsupply the viscera of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe branches which spring from the abdominal aorta to supply the viscera\r\nof this region, are considerable, both as to their number and size. They\r\nare, however, of comparatively little interest in practice. To the\r\nanatomist they present many peculiarities of distribution and form\r\nworthy of notice, as, for example, their frequent anastomosis, their\r\nlooping arrangement, and their large size and number compared with the\r\nactual bulk of the organs which they supply. As to this latter\r\npeculiarity, we interpret it according to the fact that here the vessels\r\nserve other purposes in the economy besides that of the support and\r\nrepair of structure. The vessels are large in proportion to the great\r\nquantity of fluid matter secreted from the whole extent of the inner\r\nsurface of this glandular apparatus--the gastro-intestinal canal, the\r\nliver, pancreas, and kidneys.\r\n\r\nAs anatomists, we are enabled, from a knowledge of the relative position\r\nof the various organs and bloodvessels of both the thorax and abdomen,\r\nto account for certain pathological phenomena which, as practitioners,\r\nwe possess as yet but little skill to remedy. Thus it would appear most\r\nprobable that many cases of anasarca of the lower limbs, and of dropsy\r\nof the belly, are frequently caused by diseased growths of the liver, P,\r\nobstructing the inferior vena cava, R, and vena portae, rather than by\r\nwhat we are taught to be the \"want of balance between secreting and\r\nabsorbing surfaces.\" The like occurrence may obstruct the gall-ducts,\r\nand occasion jaundice. Over-distention of any of those organs situated\r\nbeneath the right hypochondrium, will obstruct neighbouring organs and\r\nvessels. Mechanical obstruction is doubtless so frequent a source of\r\nderangement, that we need not on many occasions essay a deeper search\r\nfor explaining the mystery of disease.\r\n\r\nIn the right hypochondriac region there exists a greater variety of\r\norgans than in the left; and disease is also more frequent on the right\r\nside. Affections of the liver will consequently implicate a greater\r\nnumber of organs than affections of the spleen on the left side, for the\r\nspleen is comparatively isolated from the more important blood vessels\r\nand other organs.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the liver, P, lies in contact with the\r\ndiaphragm, N, the costal cartilages, M, and the upper and lateral parts\r\nof the abdominal parietes; and when the liver becomes the seat of\r\nabscess, this, according to its situation, will point and burst either\r\ninto the thorax above, or through the side between or beneath the false\r\nribs, M. The hepatic abscess has been known to discharge itself through\r\nthe stomach, the duodenum, T, and the transverse colon, facts which are\r\nreadily explained on seeing the close relationship which these parts\r\nhold to the under surface of the liver. When the liver is inflamed, we\r\naccount for the gastric irritation, either from the inflammation having\r\nextended to the neighbouring stomach, or by this latter organ being\r\naffected by \"reflex action.\" The hepatic cough is caused by the like\r\nphenomena disturbing the diaphragm, N, with which the liver, P, lies in\r\nclose contact.\r\n\r\nWhen large biliary concretions form in S, the gallbladder, or in the\r\nhepatic duct, Nature, failing in her efforts to discharge them through\r\nthe common bile-duct, into the duodenum, T, sets up inflammation and\r\nulcerative absorption, by aid of which processes they make a passage for\r\nthemselves through some adjacent part of the intestine, either the\r\nduodenum or the transverse colon. In these processes the gall-bladder,\r\nwhich contains the calculus, becomes soldered by effused lymph to the\r\nneighbouring part of the intestinal tube, into which the stone is to be\r\ndischarged, and thus its escape into the peritoneal sac is prevented.\r\nWhen the hepatic abscess points externally towards M, the like process\r\nisolates the matter from the cavities of the chest and abdomen.\r\n\r\nIn wounds of any part of the intestine, whether of X, the caecum, W, the\r\nsigmoid flexure of the colon, or Z, the small bowel, if sufficient time\r\nbe allowed for Nature to establish the adhesive inflammation, she does\r\nso, and thus fortifies the peritoneal sac against an escape of the\r\nintestinal matter into it by soldering the orifice of the wounded\r\nintestine to the external opening. In this mode is formed the artificial\r\nanus. The surgeon on principle aids Nature in attaining this result.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 24.\r\n\r\nA. The thyroid body.\r\n\r\nB.

This mode of distribution becomes the more apparent,\r\naccording as we rise from particulars to take a view of the whole. With\r\nthe same ease that any piece of the osseous fabric, taken separately,\r\nmay be known, so may any one artery, taken apart from the rest, be\r\ndistinguished as to the place which it occupied, and the organs which it\r\nsupplied in the economy. The vascular skeleton, whether taken as a whole\r\nor in parts, exhibits characteristics as apparent as are those of the\r\nosseous skeleton itself. The main bloodvessel, A B C, of the trunk of\r\nthe body, possesses character, sui generis, just as the vertebral column\r\nitself manifests. The main arteries of the head or limbs are as readily\r\ndistinguishable, the one from the other, as are the osseous fabrics of\r\nthe head and limbs. The visceral arteries are likewise moulded upon the\r\nforms which they supply. But evidently the arterial system of vessels\r\nconforms most strictly with the general design of the osseous skeleton.\r\n\r\nIn Plate 25, viewed as a whole, we find that as the vertebral column\r\nstands central to the osseous skeleton, so does the aorta, A B C, take\r\nthe centre of the arterial skeleton. As the ribs jut symmetrically from\r\neither side of the vertebral column, so do the intercostal arteries\r\nfollow them from their own points of origin in the aorta. The one side\r\nof the osseous system is not more like the other than is the system of\r\nvessels on one side like that of the other. And in addition to this fact\r\nof a similarity of sides in the vascular as in the osseous skeleton, I\r\nalso remark that both extremities of the aorta divide into branches\r\nwhich are similar to one another above and below, thereby conforming\r\nexactly with the upper and lower limbs, which manifest unmistakable\r\npoints of analogy.\r\n\r\nThe branches which spring from the aortic arch above are destined to\r\nsupply the head and upper limbs. They are, H, the innominate artery, and\r\nI K, the left common carotid and subclavian arteries. The branches which\r\nspring from the other extremity of the aorta are disposed for the\r\nsupport of the pelvis and lower limbs; they are the right and left\r\ncommon iliac arteries, L M. These vessels exhibit, at both ends of the\r\nmain aortic trunk, a remarkable analogy; and as the knowledge of this\r\nfact may serve to lighten the dry and weary detail of descriptive\r\nanatomy, at the same time that it points directly to views of practical\r\nimport, I may be allowed briefly to remark upon it as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe vessels which spring from both ends of the aorta, as seen in Plate\r\n25, are represented in what is called their normal character--that is,\r\nwhile three vessels, H I K, spring separately from the aortic arch\r\nabove, only two vessels, L and M, arise from the aorta below. Let the\r\nanatomist now recall to mind the \"peculiarities\" which at times appear\r\namongst the vessels, H I K, above, and he will find that some of them\r\nabsolutely correspond to the normal arrangement of the vessels, L M,\r\nbelow. And if he will consider the \"peculiarities\" which occur to the\r\nnormal order of the vessels, L M, below, he will find that some of these\r\ncorrespond exactly to the normal order of the vessels above. Thus, when\r\nI K of the left side join into a common trunk, this resembles the\r\ninnominate artery, H, of the right side, and then both these vessels\r\nperfectly correspond with the two common iliac arteries below. When, on\r\nthe other hand, L and M, the common iliac arteries, divide,\r\nimmediately after leaving the aortic trunk, into two pairs of branches,\r\nthey correspond to the abnormal condition of the vessels, H I K, above;\r\nwhere H, immediately after leaving the aortic arch, divides into two\r\nbranches, like I K. With this generalization upon the normal and\r\nabnormal facts of arrangement, exhibited among the vessels arising from\r\nboth ends of the aorta, I furnish to the reader the idea that the\r\nvessels, H I K, above may present of the same figure as the vessels, L\r\nM, below, and these latter may assume the character of H I K, above.\r\nWhenever, therefore, either set of vessels becomes the subject of\r\noperation, such as having a ligature applied to them, we must be\r\nprepared to meet the \"varieties.\"\r\n\r\nThe veins assume an arrangement similar to that of the arteries, and the\r\nabove remarks will therefore equally apply to the veins. In the same way\r\nas the arteries, H I K, may present in the condition of two common or\r\nbrachio-cephalic trunks, and thereby simulate the condition of the\r\ncommon iliac arteries, so we find that the normal forms of the veins\r\nabove and below actually and permanently exhibit this very type. The\r\nbrachio-cephalic veins, D B, Plate 26, exactly correspond to each\r\nother, and to the common iliac veins, S T; and as these latter\r\ncorrespond precisely with the common iliac arteries, so may we infer\r\nthat the original or typical condition of the vessels I K, Plate 25, is\r\na brachia-cephalic or common-trunk union corresponding with its\r\nbrachio-cephalic vein. When the vessels, I K, therefore present of the\r\nbrachio-cephalic form as the vessel H, we have a perfect correspondence\r\nbetween the two extremes of the aorta, both as regards the arteries\r\narising from it, and the veins which accompany these arteries; and this\r\ncondition of the vascular skeleton I regard as the typical uniformity.\r\nThe separate condition of the vessels I K, notwithstanding the frequency\r\nof the occurrence of such, may be considered as a special variation from\r\nthe original type.\r\n\r\nThe length of the aorta is variable in two or more bodies; and so,\r\nlikewise, is the length of the trunk of each of those great branches\r\nwhich springs from its arch above, and of those into which it divides\r\nbelow, The modes in which these variations as to length occur, are\r\nnumerous. The top of the arch of the aorta is described as being in\r\ngeneral on a level with the cartilages of the second ribs, from which\r\npoint it descends on the left side of the spinal column; and after\r\nhaving wound gradually forwards to the forepart of the lumbar spine at\r\nC, divides opposite to the fourth lumbar vertebra into the right and\r\nleft common iliac arteries. The length of that portion of the aorta\r\nwhich is called thoracic, is determined by the position of the pillars\r\nof the diaphragm F, which span the vessel; and from this point to where\r\nthe aorta divides into the two common iliac arteries, the main vessel is\r\nnamed abdominal. The aorta, from its arch to its point of division on\r\nthe lumbar vertebrae, gradually diminishes in caliber, according to the\r\nnumber and succession of the branches derived from it.\r\n\r\nThe varieties as to length exhibited by the aorta itself, and by the\r\nprincipal branches which spring from it, occur under the following\r\nmentioned conditions:--When the arch of the aorta rises above or sinks\r\nbelow its ordinary position or level,--namely, the cartilages of the\r\nsecond ribs, as seen in Plate 25,--it varies not only its own length,\r\nbut also that of the vessels H I K; for if the arch of the aorta rises\r\nabove this level, the vessels H I K become shortened; and as the arch\r\nsinks below this level, these vessels become lengthened. Even when the\r\naortic arch holds its proper level in the thorax, still the vessels H I\r\nK may vary as to length, according to the height to which they rise in\r\nthe neck previously to their division. When the aorta sinks below its\r\nproper level at the same time that the vessels H I K rise considerably\r\nabove that point at which they usually arch or divide in the neck, then\r\nof course their length becomes greatly increased. When, on the other\r\nhand, the aortic arch rises above its usual level, whilst the vessels H\r\nI K arch and divide at a low position in the neck, then their length\r\nbecomes very much diminished. The length of the artery H may be\r\nincreased even though the arch of the aorta holds its proper level, and\r\nthough the vessels H I K occupy their usual position in the neck; for it\r\nis true that the vessel H may spring from a point of the aortic arch A\r\nnearer to the origin of this from the ventricle of the heart, whilst the\r\nvessel I may be shortened, owing to the fact of its arising from some\r\npart of H, the innominate vessel. All these circumstances are so\r\nobvious, that they need no comment, were it not for the necessity of\r\nimpressing the surgeon with the fact that uncertainty as to a successful\r\nresult must always attach to his operation of including in a ligature\r\neither of the vessels H I K, so as to affect an aneurismal tumour.\r\n\r\nNow whilst the length of the aorta and that of the principal branches\r\nspringing from its arch may be varied according to the above-mentioned\r\nconditions, so may the length of the aorta itself, and of the two common\r\niliac vessels, vary according to the place whereat the aorta, C,\r\nbifurcates. Or, even when this point of division is opposite the usual\r\nvertebra,--viz., the fourth lumbar,--still the common iliac vessels may\r\nbe short or long, according to the place where they divide into external\r\nand internal iliac branches. The aorta may bifurcate almost as high up\r\nas where the pillars of the diaphragm overarch it, or as low down as the\r\nfifth lumbar vertebra. The occasional existence of a sixth lumbar\r\nvertebra also causes a variety in the length, not only of the aorta, but\r\nof the two common iliac vessels and their branches.[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Whatever may be the number of variations to which the\r\nbranches arising from both extremes of the aorta are liable, all\r\nanatomists admit that the arrangement of these vessels, as exhibited in\r\nPlate 25, is by far the most frequent. The surgical anatomist,\r\ntherefore, when planning his operation, takes this arrangement as the\r\nstandard type. Haller asserts this order of the vessels to be so\r\nconstant, that in four hundred bodies which he examined, he found only\r\none variety--namely, that in which the left vertebral artery arose from\r\nthe aorta. Of other varieties described by authors, he observes--\"Rara\r\nvero haec omnia esse si dixero cum quadringenta nunc cadavera humana\r\ndissecuerim, fidem forte inveniam.\" (Iconum Anatom.) This variety is\r\nalso stated by J. F. Meckel (Handbuch der Mensch Anat.), Soemmerring (De\r\nCorp. Hum Fabrica), Boyer (Tr. d'Anat.), and Mr. Harrison (Surg. Anal.\r\nof Art.), to be the most frequent. Tiedemann figures this variety\r\namongst others (Tabulae Arteriarum). Mr. Quain regards as the most\r\nfrequent change which occurs in the number of the branches of the aortic\r\narch, \"that in which the left carotid is derived from the innominate.\"\r\n(Anatomy of the Arteries, &c.) A case is recorded by Petsche (quoted in\r\nHaller), in which he states the bifurcation of the aorta to have taken\r\nplace at the origin of the renal arteries: (query) are we to suppose\r\nthat the renal arteries occupied their usual position? Cruveilhier\r\nrecords a case (Anal. Descript.) in which the right common iliac was\r\nwanting, in consequence of having divided at the aorta into the internal\r\nand external iliac branches. Whether the knowledge of these and numerous\r\nother varieties of the arterial system be of much practical import to\r\nthe surgeon, he will determine for himself. To the scientific anatomist,\r\nit must appear that the main object in regard to them is to submit them\r\nto a strict analogical reasoning, so as to demonstrate the operation of\r\nthat law which has produced them. To this end I have pointed to that\r\nanalogy which exists between the vessels arising from both extremities\r\nof the aorta. \"Itaque convertenda plane est opera ad inquirendas et\r\nnotandas rerum similitudines et analoga tam integralibus quam partibus;\r\nillae enim sunt, quae naturam uniunt, et constituere scientias\r\nincipiunt.\" \"Natura enim non nisi parendo vincitur; et quod in\r\ncontemplatione instar causae est; id in operatione instar regulae est.\"\r\n(Novum Organum Scientiarum, Aph. xxvii-iii, lib. i.)]\r\n\r\nThe difference between the perpendicular range of the anterior and\r\nposterior walls of the thoracic cavity may be estimated on a reference\r\nto Plate 25, in which the xyphoid cartilage, E, joined to the seventh\r\npair of ribs, bounds its anterior wall below, while F, the pillars of\r\nthe diaphragm, bound its posterior wall. The thoracic cavity is\r\ntherefore considerably deeper in its posterior than in its anterior\r\nwall; and this occasions a difference of an opposite kind in the\r\nanterior and posterior walls of the abdomen; for while the abdomen\r\nranges perpendicularly from E to W, its posterior range measures only\r\nfrom F to the ventra of the iliac bones, R. The arching form of the\r\ndiaphragm, and the lower level which the pubic symphysis occupies\r\ncompared with that of the cristae of the iliac bones, occasion this\r\ndifference in the measure of both the thorax and abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe usual position of the kidneys, G G*, is on either side of the lumbar\r\nspine, between the last ribs and the cristae of the iliac bones. The\r\nkidneys lie on the fore part of the quadratus lumborum and psoae\r\nmuscles. They are sometimes found to have descended as low as the iliac\r\nfossae, R, in consequence of pressure, occasioned by an enlarged liver\r\non the right, or by an enlarged spleen on the left. The length of the\r\nabdominal part of the aorta may be estimated as being a third of the\r\nentire vessel, measured from the top of its arch to its point of\r\nbifurcation. So many and such large vessels arise from the abdominal\r\npart of the aorta, and these are set so closely to each other, that it\r\nmust in all cases be very difficult to choose a proper locality whereat\r\nto apply a ligature on this region of the vessel. If other circumstances\r\ncould fairly justify such an operation, the anatomist believes that the\r\ncirculation might be maintained through the anastomosis of the internal\r\nmammary and intercostal arteries with the epigastric; the branches of\r\nthe superior mesenteric with those of the inferior; and the branches of\r\nthis latter with the perineal branches of the pubic. The lumbar, the\r\ngluteal, and the circumflex ilii arteries, also communicate around the\r\nhip-bone. The same vessels would serve to carryon the circulation if\r\neither L, the common iliac, V, the external iliac, or the internal iliac\r\nvessel, were the subject of the operation by ligature.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 25.\r\n\r\nA.

These several marks described on the\r\nsuperficies he takes as certain guides to the precise locality and\r\nrelations of the more deeply situated organs. And as, by dissection,\r\nNature reveals to him the fact that she holds constant to these\r\nrelations, so, at least, may all that department of practice which he\r\nbases upon this anatomical certainty be accounted as rooted in truth and\r\ngoverned by fixed principles. The same organ bears the same special and\r\ngeneral relations in all bodies, not only of the human, but of all other\r\nspecies of vertebrata; and from this evidence we conclude that the same\r\nmarks on surface indicate the exact situation of the same organs in all\r\nsimilar bodies.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the well-formed human body presents to our observation\r\ncertain standard characters with which we compare all its abnormal\r\nconditions. Every region of the body exhibits fixed character proper to\r\nits surface. The neck, the axilla, the thorax, the abdomen, the groin,\r\nhave each their special marks, by which we know them; and the eye, well\r\nversed in the characters proper to the healthy state of each, will\r\nsoonest discover the nature of all effects of injury--such as\r\ndislocations, fractures, tumours of various kinds, &c. By our\r\nacquaintance with the perfect, we discover the imperfect; by a\r\ncomparison with the geometrically true rectangled triangle, or circle,\r\nwe estimate the error of these forms when they have become distorted;\r\nand in the same way, by a knowledge of what is the healthy normal\r\nstandard of human form, we diagnose correctly its slightest degree of\r\ndeformity, produced by any cause whatever, whether by sudden accident,\r\nor slowly-approaching disease.\r\n\r\nNow, the abnormal conditions of the surface become at once apparent to\r\nour senses; but those diseased conditions which concern the internal\r\norgans require no ordinary exercise of judgment to discover them. The\r\noutward form masks the internal parts, and conceals from our direct\r\nview, like the covers of a closed volume, the marvellous history\r\ncontained within. But still the superficies is so moulded upon the\r\ndeeper situated structures, that we are induced to study it as a map,\r\nwhich discourses of all which it incloses in the healthy or the diseased\r\nstate. Thus, the sternum points to A, the aorta; the middle of the\r\nclavicles, to C, the subclavian vessels; the localities 9, 10 of the\r\ncoracoid processes indicate the place of the axillary vessels; the\r\nnavel, P, points to Q, the bifurcation of the aorta; the pubic\r\nsymphysis, Z, directs to the urinary bladder, Y. At the points 7, 8, may\r\nbe felt the anterior superior spinous processes of the iliac bones,\r\nbetween which points and Z, the iliac vessels, V, 6, pass midway to the\r\nthigh, and give off the epigastric vessels, 2, 3, to the abdominal\r\nparietes. Between these points of general relations, which we trace on\r\nthe surface of the trunk of the body, the anatomist includes the entire\r\nhistory of the special relations of the organs within contained. And not\r\nuntil he is capable of summing together the whole picture of anatomical\r\nanalysis, and of viewing this in all its intricate relationary\r\ncombination--even through and beneath the closed surface of living\r\nmoving nature, is he prepared to estimate the conditions of disease, or\r\ninterfere for its removal.\r\n\r\nWhen fluid accumulates on either side of the thoracic compartment to\r\nsuch an excess that an opening is required to be made for its exit from\r\nthe body, the operator, who is best acquainted with the relations of the\r\nparts in a state of health, is enabled to judge with most correctness in\r\nhow far these parts, when in a state of disease, have swerved from these\r\nproper relations. In the normal state of the thoracic viscera, the left\r\nthoracic space, G A K N, is occupied by the heart and left lung. The\r\nspace indicated within the points A N K, in the anterior region of the\r\nthorax, is occupied by the heart, which, however, is partially\r\noverlapped by the anterior edge of the lung, PLATE 22. If the thorax be\r\ndeeply penetrated at any part of this region, the instrument will wound\r\neither the lung or the heart, according to the situation of the wound.\r\nBut when fluid becomes effused in any considerable quantity within the\r\npleural sac, it occupies space between the lung and the thoracic walls;\r\nand the fluid compresses the lung, or displaces the heart from the left\r\nside towards the right. This displacement may take place to such an\r\nextent, that the heart, instead of occupying the left thoracic angle, A\r\nK N, assumes the position of A K* N on the right side. Therefore, as the\r\nfluid, whatever be its quantity, intervenes between the thoracic walls,\r\nK K*, and the compressed lung, the operation of paracentesis thoracis\r\nshould be performed at the point K, or between K and the latissimus\r\ndorsi muscle, so as to avoid any possibility of wounding the heart. The\r\nintercostal artery at K is not of any considerable size.\r\n\r\nIn the normal state of the thoracic organs, the pericardial envelope of\r\nthe heart is at all times more or less uncovered by the anterior edge of\r\nthe left lung, as seen in PLATE 22. When serous or other fluid\r\naccumulates to an excess in the pericardium, so as considerably to\r\ndistend this sac, it must happen that a greater area of pericardial\r\nsurface will be exposed and brought into immediate contact with the\r\nthoracic walls on the left side of the sternal median line, to the\r\nexclusion of the left lung, which now no longer interposes between the\r\nheart and the thorax. At this locality, therefore, a puncture may be\r\nmade through the thoracic walls, directly into the distended\r\npericardium, for the escape of its fluid contents, if such proceeding be\r\nin other respects deemed prudent and advisable.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal cavity being very frequently the seat of dropsical\r\neffusion, when this takes place to any great extent, despite the\r\ncontinued and free use of the medicinal diuretic and the hydragogue\r\ncathartic, the surgeon is required to make an opening with the\r\ninstrumental hydragogue--viz., the trocar and cannula. The proper\r\nlocality whereat the puncture is to be made so as to avoid any large\r\nbloodvessel or other important organ, is at the middle third of the\r\nmedian line, between P the umbilicus, and Z the symphysis pubis. The\r\nanatomist chooses this median line as the safest place in which to\r\nperform paracentesis abdominis, well knowing the situation of 2, 3, the\r\nepigastric vessels, and of Y, the urinary bladder.\r\n\r\nAll kinds of fluid occupying the cavities of the body gravitate towards\r\nthe most depending part; and therefore, as in the sitting or standing\r\nposture, the fluid of ascites falls upon the line P Z, the propriety of\r\ngiving the patient this position, and of choosing some point within the\r\nline P Z, for the place whereat to make the opening, becomes obvious. In\r\nthe female, the ovary is frequently the seat of dropsical accumulation\r\nto such an extent as to distend the abdomen very considerably. Ovarian\r\ndropsy is distinguished from ascites by the particular form and\r\nsituation of the swelling. In ascites, the abdominal swell is\r\nsymmetrical, when the body stands or sits erect. In ovarian dropsy, the\r\ntumour is greatest on either side of the median line, according as the\r\naffected ovary happens to be the right or the left one.\r\n\r\nThe fluid of ascites and that of the ovarian dropsy affect the position\r\nof the abdominal viscera variously In ascites, the fluid gravitates to\r\nwhichever side the body inclines, and it displaces the moveable viscera\r\ntowards the opposite side. Therefore, to whichever side the abdominal\r\nfluid gravitates, we may expect to find it occupying space between the\r\nabdominal parietes and the small intestines. The ovarian tumour is, on\r\nthe contrary, comparatively fixed to either side of the abdominal median\r\nline; and whether it be the right or left ovary that is affected, it\r\npermanently displaces the intestines on its own side; and the sac lies\r\nin contact with the neighbouring abdominal parietes; nor will the\r\nintestines and it change position according to the line of gravitation.\r\n\r\nNow, though the above-mentioned circumstances be anatomically true\r\nrespecting dropsical effusion within the general peritonaeal sac and\r\nthat of the ovary, there are many urgent reasons for preferring to all\r\nother localities the line P Z, as the only proper one for puncturing the\r\nabdomen so as to give exit to the fluid. For though the peritonaeal\r\nascites does, according to the position of the patient, gravitate to\r\neither side of the abdomen, and displace the moveable viscera on that\r\nside, we should recollect that some of these are bound fixedly to one\r\nplace, and cannot be floated aside by the gravitating fluid. The liver\r\nis fixed to the right side, 11, by its suspensory ligaments. The\r\nspleen occupies the left side, 12. The caecum and the sigmoid flexure of\r\nthe colon occupy, R R*, the right and left iliac regions. The colon\r\nranges transversely across the abdomen, at P. The stomach lies\r\ntransversely between the points, 11, 12. The kidneys, O, occupy the\r\nlumbar region. All these organs continue to hold their proper places, to\r\nwhatever extent the dropsical effusion may take place, and\r\nnotwithstanding the various inclinations of the body in this or that\r\ndirection. On this account, therefore, we avoid performing the operation\r\nof paracentesis abdominis at any part except the median line, P Z; and\r\nas to this place, we prefer it to all others, for the following cogent\r\nreasons--viz., the absence of any large artery; the absence of any\r\nimportant viscus; the fact that the contained fluid gravitates in large\r\nquantity, and in immediate contact with the abdominal walls anteriorly,\r\nand interposes itself between these walls and the small intestines,\r\nwhich float free, and cannot approach the parietes of the abdomen nearer\r\nthan the length which the mesenteric bond allows.\r\n\r\nIf the ovarian dropsy form a considerable tumour in the abdomen, it may\r\nbe readily reached by the trocar and cannula penetrating the line P Z.\r\nAnd thus we avoid the situation of the epigastric vessels. The puncture\r\nthrough the linea alba should never be made below the point, midway\r\nbetween P and Z, lest we wound the urinary bladder, which, when\r\ndistended, rises considerably above the pubic symphysis.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many mechanical obstructions which, by impeding the\r\ncirculation, give rise to dropsical effusion, are the following:--An\r\naneurismal tumour of the aorta, A, or the innominate artery, [Footnote\r\n1] F, may press upon the veins, H or D, and cause an oedematous swelling\r\nof the corresponding side of the face and the right arm. In the same way\r\nan aneurism of the aorta, Q, by pressing upon the inferior vena cava, T,\r\nmay cause oedema of the lower limbs. Serum may accumulate in the\r\npericardium, owing to an obstruction of the cardiac veins, caused by\r\nhypertrophy of the substance of the heart; and when from this cause the\r\npericardium becomes much distended with fluid, the pressure of this upon\r\nthe flaccid auricles and large venous trunks may give rise to general\r\nanasarca, to hydrothorax or ascites, either separate or co-existing.\r\nTuberculous deposits in the lungs and scrofulous bronchial glands may\r\ncause obstructive pressure on the pulmonary veins, followed by effusion\r\nof either pus or serum into the pleural sac. [Footnote 2] An abscess or\r\nother tumour of the liver may, by pressing on the vena portae, cause\r\nserous effusion into the peritonaeal sac; or by pressure on the inferior\r\nvena cava, which is connected with the posterior thick border of the\r\nliver, may cause anasarca of the lower limbs. Matter accumulating\r\nhabitually in the sigmoid flexure of the colon may cause a hydrocele, or\r\na varicocele, by pressing on the spermatic veins of the left side. It is\r\nquite true that these two last-named affections appear more frequently\r\non the left side than on the right; and it seems to me much more\r\nrational to attribute them to the above-mentioned circumstance than to\r\nthe fact that the left spermatic veins open, at a disadvantageous right\r\nangle, into the left renal vein.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The situation of this vessel, its close relation to the\r\npleura, the aorta, the large venous trunks, the vagus and phrenic\r\nnerves, and the uncertainty as to its length, or as to whether or not a\r\nthyroid or vertebral branch arises from it, are circumstances which\r\nrender the operation of tying the vessel in cases of aneurism very\r\ndoubtful as to a successful issue. The operation (so far as I know) has\r\nhitherto failed. Anatomical relations, nearly similar to these, prevent,\r\nin like manner, an easy access to the iliac arteries, and cause the\r\noperator much anxiety as to the issue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The effusion of fluid into the pleural sac (from whatever\r\ncause it may arise) sometimes takes place to a very remarkable extent. I\r\nhave had opportunities of examining patients, in whom the heart appeared\r\nto be completely dislocated, from the left to the right side, owing to\r\nthe large collection of serous fluid in the left pleural sac. The\r\nheart's pulsations could be felt distinctly under the right nipple.\r\nParacentesis thoracis was performed at the point indicated in PLATE 26.\r\nIn these cases, and another observed at the Hotel Dieu, the heart and\r\nlung, in consequence of the extensive adhesions which they contracted in\r\ntheir abnormal position, did not immediately resume their proper\r\nsituation when the fluid was withdrawn from the chest. Nor is it to be\r\nexpected that they should ever return to their normal character and\r\nposition, when the disease which caused their displacement has been of\r\nlong standing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 26.\r\n\r\nA.

So\r\nminutely has he dissected every structure proper to this locality, and\r\nso closely has he investigated every possible condition of it as being\r\nthe seat of hernial, that the only novelty which now remains to be\r\nsought for is that of a simplification of the facts, already known to be\r\nfar too much obscured by an unwieldy nomenclature, and a useless detail\r\nof trifling evidence. And it would seem that nothing can more directly\r\ntend to this simplification, than that of viewing the inguinal and\r\nfemoral regions, not separately, but as a relationary whole. For as both\r\nregions are blended together by structures which are common to both, so\r\ndo the herniae which are described as being proper to either region,\r\noccur in such close connexion as at times to render it very difficult to\r\ndistinguish between them.\r\n\r\nThe human species is, of all others, most subject to hernial in the\r\ngroin. The erect attitude of the human form, and the fact that many of\r\nits more powerful muscular efforts are performed in this posture, cause\r\nits more frequent liability to the accidents called abdominal herniae or\r\nruptures.\r\n\r\nThe viscera of the abdomen occupy this cavity completely, and indeed\r\nthey naturally, at all times, subject the abdominal parietes to a state\r\nof constant pressure, as may be proved by their escape from the abdomen\r\nin cases of large wounds of this region. In the erect posture of the\r\nbody this pressure is increased, for the viscera now gravitate and force\r\ndownwards and forwards against the abdominal parietes. In addition to\r\nthis gravitating force, another power impels the viscera from above\r\ndownwards--namely, that of the muscles of the trunk, and the principal\r\nagent amongst these is the diaphragm. The lungs, again, expanding above\r\nthe diaphragm, add also to the gravitation of the abdominal contents,\r\nand these, under the pressure thus accumulated, occasionally make an\r\nexit for themselves at the groins, which are the weakest and most\r\ndepending parts of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nHerniae are variously named in accordance with the following\r\ncircumstances--viz., the precise locality at which they occur--the size\r\nand form of the tumour--the time of life at which they happen. Sexual\r\npeculiarities do not serve to distinguish herniae, though it is true\r\nthat the inguinal form, at the part D F, occurs more commonly in the\r\nmale, whilst the crural form, at the opening E, happens more frequently\r\nin the female.\r\n\r\nThe most common forms of herniae happen at those localities where the\r\nabdominal walls are traversed by the bloodvessels on their way to the\r\noutstanding organs, and where, in consequence, the walls of the abdomen\r\nhave become weakened. It also happens, that at these very situations the\r\nvisceral pressure is greatest whilst the body stands erect. These\r\nlocalities are, A, the umbilicus, a point characterized as having given\r\npassage (in the foetal state) to the umbilical vessels; D, the place\r\nwhere the spermatic vessels and duct pass from the abdomen to the\r\ntesticle; and immediately beneath this, the crural arch, which gives\r\nexit to the crural vessels. Herniae may happen at other localities, such\r\nas at the thyroid aperture, which transmits the thyroid vessels; and at\r\nthe greater sacrosciatic notch, through which the gluteal vessels pass;\r\nand all regions of the abdominal walls may give exit to intestinal\r\nprotrusion in consequence of malformations, disease, or injury. But as\r\nthe more frequent varieties of herniae are those which traverse the\r\nlocalities, A, D, E, and as these, fortunately, are the most manageable\r\nunder the care of the surgical anatomist, we proceed to examine the\r\nstructures concerned in their occurrence.\r\n\r\nA direct opening from within outwards does not exist in the walls of the\r\nabdomen; and anatomy demonstrates to us the fact, that where the\r\nspermatic cord, D F, and the femoral vessels, pass from the abdomen to\r\nthe external parts, they carry with them a covering of the several\r\nlayers of structures, both muscular and membranous, which they encounter\r\nin their passage. The inguinal and crural forms of herniae which follow\r\nthe passages made by the spermatic cord, and the crural vessels, must\r\nnecessarily carry with them the like investments, and these are what\r\nconstitute the coverings of the herniae themselves.\r\n\r\nThe groin in its undissected state is marked by certain elevations and\r\ndepressions which indicate the general relations of the subcutaneous\r\nparts. The abdomen is separated from the thigh by an undulating grooved\r\nline, extending from C*, the point of the iliac bone, to B, the\r\nsymphysis pubis This line or fold of the groin coincides exactly with\r\nthe situation of that fibrous band of the external oblique muscle named\r\nPoupart's ligament. From below the middle of this abdomino-femoral\r\ngroove, C B, another curved line, D, b, springs, and courses obliquely,\r\ninwards and downwards, between the upper part of the thigh and the\r\npubis, to terminate in the scrotum. The external border of this line\r\nindicates the course of the spermatic cord, D F, which can be readily\r\nfelt beneath the skin. In all subjects, however gross or emaciated they\r\nmay happen to be, these two lines are readily distinguishable, and as\r\nthey bear relations to the several kinds of rupture taking place in\r\nthese parts, the surgeon should consider them with keen regard. A\r\ncomparison of the two sides of the figure, PLATE 27, will show that the\r\nspermatic cord, D F, and Poupart's ligament, C B, determine the shape of\r\nthe inguino-femoral region. When the integument with the subcutaneous\r\nadipose tissue is removed from the inguino-femoral region, we expose\r\nthat common investing membrane called the superficial fascia. This\r\nfascia, a a a, stretches over the lower part of the abdomen and the\r\nupper part of the thigh. It becomes intimately attached to Poupart's\r\nligament along the ilio-pubic line, C B; it invests the spermatic cord,\r\nas shown at b, and descends into the scrotum, so as to encase this part.\r\nWhere this superficial fascia overlies the saphenous opening, E, of the\r\nfascia lata, it assumes a \"cribriform\" character, owing to its being\r\npierced by numerous lymphatic vessels and some veins. As this\r\nsuperficial fascia invests all parts of the inguino-femoral region, as\r\nit forms an envelope for the spermatic cord, D F, and sheathes over the\r\nsaphenous opening, E, it must follow of course that wherever the hernial\r\nprotrusion takes place in this region, whether at D, or F, or E, or\r\nadjacent parts, this membrane forms the external subcutaneous covering\r\nof the bowel.\r\n\r\nThere is another circumstance respecting the form and attachments of the\r\nsuperficial fascia, which, in a pathological point of view, is worthy of\r\nnotice--viz., that owing to the fact of its enveloping the scrotum,\r\npenis, spermatic cord, and abdominal parietes, whilst it becomes firmly\r\nattached to Poupart's ligament along the abdomino-femoral fold, B C, it\r\nisolates these parts, in some degree, from the thigh; and when urine\r\nhappens to be from any cause extravasated through this abdominal-scrotal\r\nbag of the superficial fascia, the thighs do not in general participate\r\nin the inflammation superinduced upon such accident.\r\n\r\nThe spermatic cord, D, emerges from the abdomen and becomes definable\r\nthrough the fibres of the sheathing tendon of the external oblique\r\nmuscle, H, at a point midway between the extremities of the ilio-pubic\r\nline or fold. In some cases, this place, whereat the cord first\r\nmanifests itself in the groin, lies nearer the pubic symphysis; but\r\nhowever much it may vary in this particular, we may safely regard the\r\nfemoro-pubic fold, D, b, as containing the cord, and also that the place\r\nwhere this fold meets the iliopubic line, C B, at the point D, marks the\r\nexit of the cord from the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe spermatic cord does not actually pierce the sheathing tendon of the\r\nexternal oblique muscle at the point D, and there does not, in fact,\r\nexist naturally such an opening as the \"external abdominal ring,\" for\r\nthe cord carries with it a production of the tendon of the external\r\noblique muscle, and this has been named by surgical anatomists the\r\n\"intercolumnar fascia,\" [Footnote] the \"spermatic fascia.\" The fibres of\r\nthis spermatic fascia are seen at D F, crossing the cord obliquely, and\r\nencasing it. This covering of the cord lies beneath the spermatic\r\nenvelope formed by, a b, the superficial fascia; and when a hernial\r\nprotrusion descends through the cord, both these investing membranes\r\nform the two outermost envelopes for the intestine in its new and\r\nabnormal situation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: On referring to the works of Sir Astley Cooper, Hesselbach,\r\nScarpa, and, others, I find attempts made to establish a distinction\r\nbetween what is called the \"intercolumnar fascia\" and the \"spermatic\r\nfascia,\" and just as if these were structures separable from each other\r\nor from the aponeurotic sheath of the external oblique muscle. I find,\r\nin like manner, in these and other works, a tediously-laboured account\r\nof the superficial fascia, as being divisible into two layers of\r\nmembrane, and that this has given rise to considerable difference of\r\nopinion as to whether or not we should regard the deeper layer as being\r\na production of the fascia lata, ascending from the thigh to the\r\nabdomen, or rather of the membrane of the abdomen descending to the\r\nthigh, &c. These and such like considerations I omit to discuss here;\r\nfor, with all proper deference to the high authority of the authors\r\ncited, I dare to maintain, that, in a practical point of view, they arc\r\nabsolutely of no moment, and in a purely scientific view, they are, so\r\nfar as regards the substance of the truth which they would reveal,\r\nwholly beneath the notice of the rational mind. The practitioner who\r\nwould arm his judgment with the knowledge of a broad fact or principle,\r\nshould not allow his serious attention to be diverted by a pursuit after\r\nany such useless and trifling details, for not only are they unallied to\r\nthe stern requirements of surgical skill, but they serve to degrade it\r\nfrom the rank and roll of the sciences. Whilst operating for the\r\nreduction of inguinal hernia by the \"taxis\" or the bistoury, who is\r\nthere that feels anxiety concerning the origin or the distinctiveness of\r\nthe \"spermatic fascia?\" Or, knowing it to be present, who concerns\r\nhimself about the better propriety of naming it \"tunica vaginalis\r\ncommunis,\" \"tunique fibreuse du cordon spermatique,\" \"fascia\r\ncremasterica,\" or \"tunica aponeurotica?\"]\r\n\r\nThe close relations which the cord, D F, bears to the saphenous opening,\r\nE, of the fascia lata, should be closely considered, forasmuch as when\r\nan oblique inguinal hernia descends from D to F, it approaches the\r\nsituation of the saphenous opening, E, which is the seat of the femoral\r\nor crural hernia, and both varieties of hernia may hence be confounded.\r\nBut with a moderate degree of judgment, based upon the habit of\r\nreferring the anatomy to the surface, such error may always be avoided.\r\nThis important subject shall be more fully treated of further on.\r\n\r\nThe superficial bloodvessels of the inguino-femoral region are, e e,\r\nthe saphenous vein, which, ascending from the inner side of the leg and\r\nthigh, pierces the saphenous opening, E, to unite with the femoral vein.\r\nThe saphenous vein, previously to entering the saphenous opening,\r\nreceives the epigastric vein, i, the external circumflex ilii vein, h,\r\nand another venous branch, d, coming from the fore part of the thigh. In\r\nthe living body the course of the distended saphenous vein may be traced\r\nbeneath the skin, and easily avoided in surgical operations upon the\r\nparts contained in this region. Small branches of the femoral artery\r\npierce the fascia lata, and accompany these superficial veins. Both\r\nthese orders of vessels are generally divided in the operation required\r\nfor the reduction of either the inguinal or the femoral strangulated\r\nhernia; but they are, for the most part, unimportant in size. Some\r\nbranches of nerves, such as, k, the external cutaneous, which is given\r\noff from the lumbar nerves, and, f, the middle cutaneous, which is\r\nderived from the crural nerve, pierce the fascia lata, and appear upon\r\nthe external side and middle of the thigh.\r\n\r\nNumerous lymphatic glands occupy the inguino-femoral region; these can\r\nbe felt, lying subcutaneous, even in the undissected state of the parts.\r\nThese glands form two principal groups, one of which, c, lies along the\r\nmiddle of the inguinal fold, C B; the other, G g, lies scattered in the\r\nneighbourhood of the saphenous opening. The former group receive the\r\nlymphatic vessels of the generative organs; and the glands of which it\r\nis composed are those which suppurate in, syphilitic or other affections\r\nof these parts.\r\n\r\nThe general relations which the larger vessels of the inguino-femoral\r\nregion bear to each other and to the superficies, may be referred to in\r\nPLATE 27, with practical advantage. The umbilicus, A, indicates pretty\r\ngenerally the level at which the aorta bifurcates on the forepart of the\r\nlumbar vertebrae. In the erect, and even in the recumbent posture, the\r\naorta may (especially in emaciated subjects) be felt pulsating under the\r\npressure of the hand; for the vertebrae bear forward the vessel to a\r\nlevel nearly equal with, C C, the anterior superior spinous processes of\r\nthe iliac bones. If a gunshot were to pass through the abdomen,\r\ntransversely, from these points, and through B, it would penetrate the\r\naorta at its bifurcation. The line A B coincides with the linea alba.\r\nThe oblique lines, A D, A D,* indicate the course of the iliac vessels.\r\nThe point D marks the situation where the spermatic vessels enter the\r\nabdomen; and also where the epigastric artery is given off from the\r\nexternal iliac. The most convenient line of incision that can be made\r\nfor reaching the situation of either of the iliac arteries, is that\r\nwhich ranges from C, the iliac spine, to D, the point where the\r\nspermatic cord enters the abdomen. The direct line drawn between D and G\r\nmarks the course of the femoral artery, and this ranges along the outer\r\nborder, E, of the saphenous opening.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 27.\r\n\r\nA.

As this fold corresponds with\r\nPoupart's ligament, it is taken as a guide to distinguish between the\r\ninguinal and femoral forms of herniae.\r\n\r\nThe general relations of the superficial fascia are well described by\r\nCamper in the following sentence: \"Musculus obliquus igitur externus\r\nabdominis, qua parte carneus est, membrana quadam propria, quali omnes\r\nmusculi, tegitur, quae sensim in aponeurosin mutata, ac cum tendineis\r\nhujus musculi partibus unita, externe ac anteriore parte abdomen tegit;\r\nfinem vero nullibi habere perspicuum est, ad pubem enim miscet cellulosa\r\nmembrana, cum ligamento penis in viris ac clitoridis in feminis,\r\ninvolucrum dat musculo cremasteri, ac aponeuroseos speciem musculis\r\nanterioribus femoris, qua glandulae inguinales, ac cruris vasa majora\r\nobteguntur.\" (Icones Herniarum.)\r\n\r\nOwing to the varied thickness of the adipous tissue contained in the\r\nsuperficial fascia at several regions of the same body, and at some\r\ncorresponding regions of different individuals, it will be evident that\r\nthe depth of the incision required to divide it, so as to expose\r\nsubjacent structures, must vary accordingly. Where the superficial\r\nfascia, after encasing the cord, descends into the scrotum, it is also\r\ndevoid of the fatty tissu.\r\n\r\nBy the removal of the superficial fascia and glands we expose the\r\naponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, A a, Pl. 28, (constituting\r\nthe third layer of the groin,) and also the fascia of the thigh, H L.\r\nThese strong fibrous structures will be observed to hold still in situ\r\nthe other parts, and to be the chief agents in determining the normal\r\nform of this region.\r\n\r\nThe inguino-femoral region, as being the seat of hernial protrusions,\r\nmay in this stage of the dissection be conveniently described as a space\r\nformed of two triangles--the one inguinal, the other femoral, placed\r\nbase to base. The inguinal triangle may be drawn between the points, B\r\nC D, Pl. 28, while the femoral triangle may be marked by the points, C D\r\nN. The conjoined bases of these triangles correspond to Poupart's\r\nligament along the line, C D. The inguinal varieties of herniae occur\r\nimmediately above the line, C D, while the femoral varieties of herniae\r\ntake place below this line. The herniae of the inguinal triangle are,\r\ntherefore, distinguishable from those of the femoral triangle by a\r\nreference to the line, C D, or Poupart's ligament.\r\n\r\nThe aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle occupies the whole of\r\nthat space which I have marked as the inguinal triangle, B C D, Pl. 28.\r\nThe fleshy fibres of the muscle, A, after forming the lateral wall of\r\nthe abdomen, descend to the level of C, the iliac spinous process, and\r\nhere give off the inguinal part of their broad tendon, a. The fibres of\r\nthis part of the tendon descend obliquely downwards and forwards to\r\nbecome inserted at the median line of the abdomen into the linea alba, B\r\nD, as also into the symphysis and crista of the os pubis. The lower band\r\nof the fibres of this tendinous sheath--viz., that which is stretched\r\nbetween C, the iliac spine, and D, the crista pubis, is named Poupart's\r\nligament; and this is strongly connected with H, the iliac portion of\r\nthe fascia lata of the thigh.\r\n\r\nPoupart's ligament is not stretched tensely in a right line, like the\r\nstring of a bow, between the points, C and D. With regard to these\r\npoints it is lax, and curves down towards the thigh like the arc of a\r\ncircle. The degree of tension which it manifests when the thigh is in\r\nthe extended position is chiefly owing to its connexion with the fascia\r\nlata. If in this position of the limb we sever the connexion between the\r\nligament and fascia, the former becomes relaxed in the same degree as it\r\ndoes when we flex the thigh upon the abdomen. The utmost degree of\r\nrelaxation which can be given to Poupart's ligament is effected by\r\nflexing the thigh towards the abdomen, at the same time that we support\r\nthe body forwards. This fact has its practical application in connexion\r\nwith the reduction of herniae.\r\n\r\nImmediately above the middle of Poupart's ligament, at the point E, Pl.\r\n28, we observe the commencement of a separation taking place among the\r\nfibres of the aponeurosis. These divide into two bands, which, gradually\r\nwidening from each other as they proceed inwards, become inserted, the\r\nupper one into the symphysis pubis, the lower into the spine and\r\npectineal ridge of this bone. The lower band identifies itself with\r\nPoupart's ligament. The interval which is thus formed by the separation\r\nof these fibres assumes the appearance of an acute triangle, the apex of\r\nwhich is at E, and the base at D. But the outer end of this interval is\r\nrounded off by certain fibres which cross those of the bands at varying\r\nangles. At this place, the aponeurosis, thus constituted of fibres\r\ndisposed crossways, is elongated into a canal, forming an envelope for\r\nthe cord, K. This elongation is named the \"external spermatic fascia,\"\r\nand is continued over the cord as far as the testicle. In the female, a\r\nsimilar canal encloses the round ligament of the uterus. From the\r\nabove-mentioned facts, it will appear that the so-called \"external\r\nabdominal ring\" does not exist as an aperture with defined margins\r\nformed in the tendon of the external oblique muscle. It is only when we\r\ndivide the spermatic fascia upon the cord at K, that we form the\r\nexternal ring, and then it must be regarded as an artificial opening, as\r\nat D, Pl. 29.\r\n\r\nThe part of the groin where the spermatic fascia is first derived from\r\nthe aponeurosis, so as to envelope the cord, varies in several\r\nindividuals; and thereupon depends, in great measure, the strength or\r\nweakness of the groin. In some cases, the cord becomes pendulous as far\r\noutwards as the point E, Pl. 28, which corresponds to the internal ring,\r\nthereby offering a direct passage for the hernial protrusion. In other\r\ninstances, the two bands of the aponeurosis, known as the \"pillars of\r\nthe ring,\" together with the transverse fibres, or \"intercolumnar\r\nfascia,\" firmly embrace and support the cord as far inwards as the point\r\nK, and by the oblique direction thus given to the cord in traversing the\r\ninguinal parietes, these parts are fortified against the occurrence of\r\nhernia. In Pl. 28, the cord, K, will be observed to drop over the lower\r\nband of fibres, (\"external pillar of the ring,\") and to have D, the\r\ncrista pubis, on its inner side. In Pl. 29, the upper band of fibres\r\n(\"internal pillar of the ring\") may be seen proceeding to its insertion\r\ninto the symphysis pubis. When a hernial tumour protrudes at the\r\nsituation K, it is invested, in the same manner as the cord, by the\r\nspermatic fascia, and holds in respect to the fibrous bands or pillars\r\nthe same relations also as this part.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the tendon of the external oblique muscle, A a,  Pl. 28,\r\ntogether with its spermatic elongation, E, we expose the internal\r\noblique, F E, Pl. 29, and the cremaster, constituting the fourth\r\ninguinal layer. The fleshy part of this muscle, F E, occupies a much\r\ngreater extent of the inguinal region than does that of the external\r\noblique. Whilst the fleshy fibres of the latter terminate on a level\r\nwith C, the iliac spine, those of the internal oblique are continued\r\ndown as far as the external abdominal ring, E D h, and even protrude\r\nthrough this place in the form of a cremaster. The muscular fibres of\r\nthe internal oblique terminate internally at the linea semilunaris, g;\r\nwhile Poupart's ligament, the spinous process and crest of the ilium,\r\ngive origin to them externally. At the linea semilunaris, the tendon of\r\nthe internal oblique is described as dividing into two layers, which\r\npassing, one before and the other behind the rectus abdominis, thus\r\nenclose this muscle in a sheath, after which they are inserted into the\r\nlinea alba, G. The direction of the fibres of the inguinal portion of\r\nthe muscle, F E, is obliquely downwards and forwards, and here they are\r\nfirmly overlaid by the aponeurosis of the external oblique.\r\n\r\nThe cremaster muscle manifests itself as being a part of the internal\r\noblique, viewing this in its totality. Cloquet (Recherches anatomiques\r\nsur les Hernies de l'Abdomen) first demonstrated the correctness of this\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nThe oblique and serial arrangement of the muscular fibres of the\r\ninternal oblique, F, Pl. 29, is seen to be continued upon the spermatic\r\ncord by the fibres of the cremaster, E e. These fibres, like those of\r\nthe lower border of the internal oblique, arise from the middle of\r\nPoupart's ligament, and after descending over the cord as far as the\r\ntesticle in the form of a series of inverted loops, e, again ascend to\r\njoin the tendon of the internal oblique, by which they become inserted\r\ninto the crest and pectineal ridge of the os pubis. The peculiar looping\r\narrangement exhibited by the cremasteric fibres indicates the fact that\r\nthe testicle, during its descent from the loins to the scrotum, carried\r\nwith it a muscular covering, at the expense of the internal oblique\r\nmuscle. The cremaster, therefore, is to be interpreted as a production\r\nof the internal oblique, just as the spermatic fascia is an elongation\r\nof the external oblique. The hernia, which follows the course of the\r\nspermatic vessels, must therefore necessarily become invested by\r\ncremasteric fibres.\r\n\r\nThe fascia lata, H, Pl. 28, being strongly connected and continuous with\r\nPoupart's ligament along its inferior border, the boundary line, which\r\nPoupart's ligament is described as drawing between the abdomen and\r\nthigh, must be considered as merely an artificial one.\r\n\r\nIn the upper region of the thigh the fascia lata is divided into two\r\nparts--viz., H, the iliac part, and L, the pubic. The iliac part, H,\r\nwhich is external, and occupying a higher plane than the pubic part, is\r\nattached to Poupart's ligament along its whole extent, from C to D, Pl.\r\n28; that is, from the anterior iliac spinous process to the crista\r\npubis. From this latter point over the upper and inner part of the\r\nthigh, the iliac division of the fascia appears to terminate in an edge\r\nof crescentic shape, h; but this appearance is only given to it by our\r\nseparating the superficial fascia with which it is, in the natural state\r\nof the parts, blended. The pubic part of the fascia, L, Pl. 28, which is\r\nmuch thinner than the iliac part, covers the pectineus muscle, and is\r\nattached to the crest and pectineal ridge of the os pubis, occupying a\r\nplane, therefore, below the iliac part, and in this way passes outwards\r\nbeneath the sheath of the femoral vessels, K I, Pl. 29. These two\r\ndivisions of the fascia lata, although separated above, are united and\r\ncontinuous on the same plane below. An interval is thus formed between\r\nthem for the space of about two inches below the inner third of\r\nPoupart's ligament; and this interval is known as the \"saphenous\r\nopening,\" L h, Pl. 28. Through this opening, the saphena vein, O, Pl.\r\n29, enters the femoral vein, I.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing remarks it will appear that no such aperture as that\r\nwhich is named \"saphenous,\" and described as being shaped in the manner\r\nof L h, Pl. 28, with its \"upper and lower cornua,\" and its \"falciform\r\nprocess,\" or edge, h, exists naturally. Nor need we be surprised,\r\ntherefore, that so accurate an observer as Soemmering (de Corporis\r\nHumani Fabrica) appears to have taken no notice of it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the pubic part of the fascia lata passes beneath the sheath of\r\nthe femoral vessels, K I, Pl. 29, the iliac part, H h, blends by its\r\nfalciform margin with the superficial fascia, and also with N n, the\r\nsheath of the femoral vessels. The so-called saphenous opening,\r\ntherefore, is naturally masked by the superficial fascia; and this\r\nmembrane being here perforated for the passage of the saphena vein, and\r\nits tributary branches, as also the efferent vessels of the lymphatic\r\nglands, is termed \"cribriform.\"\r\n\r\nThe femoral vessels, K I, contained in their proper sheath, lie\r\nimmediately beneath the iliac part of the fascia lata, in that angle\r\nwhich is expressed by Poupart's ligament, along the line C D above; by\r\nthe sartorius muscle in the line C M externally; and by a line drawn\r\nfrom D to N, corresponding to the pectineus muscle internally. The\r\nfemoral vein, I, lies close to the outer margin of the saphenous\r\nopening. The artery, K, lies close to the outer side of the vein; and\r\nexternal to the artery is seen, L, the anterior crural nerve, sending\r\noff its superficial and deep branches.\r\n\r\nWhen a femoral hernia protrudes at the saphenous space L h, Pl. 28, the\r\ndense falciform process, h, embraces its outer side, while the pubic\r\nportion of the fascia, L, lies beneath it. The cord, K, is placed on the\r\ninner side of the hernia; the cribriform fascia covers it; and the upper\r\nend of the saphena vein, M, passes beneath its lower border. The upper\r\ncornu, h, Pl. 29, of the falciform process would seem, by its situation,\r\nto be one of the parts which constrict a crural hernia. An inguinal\r\nhernia, which descends the cord, K, Pl. 28, provided it passes no\r\nfurther than the point indicated at K, and a crural hernia turning\r\nupwards from the saphenous interval over the cord at K, are very likely\r\nto present some difficulty in distinctive diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 28 & 29.\r\n\r\nPLATE 28.\r\n\r\nA.

This muscle is similar in shape and dimensions to the internal\r\noblique. The connexions of both are also similar, inasmuch as they arise\r\nfrom the inner edge of the crista ilii, and from the outer half of, V,\r\nPoupart's ligament. The fleshy fibres of these two muscles vary but\r\nlittle in direction, and terminate at the same place--viz., the linea\r\nsemilunaris, which marks the outer border of the rectus muscle. But\r\nwhilst the fleshy parts of these three abdominal muscles, D E F, form\r\nsuccessive strata in the groin, their aponeurotic tendons present the\r\nfollowing peculiarities of arrangement in respect to the rectus muscle.\r\nThe tendon of the external oblique, d, passes altogether in front of the\r\nrectus; that of the internal oblique is split opposite the linea\r\nsemilunaris into two layers, which enclose the rectus between them as\r\nthey pass to be inserted into the linea alba. But midway between the\r\nnavel and pubes, at the point marked G, both layers of the tendon are\r\nfound to pass in front of the rectus. The tendon of the transverse\r\nmuscle passes behind the rectus; but opposite the point G, it joins both\r\nlayers of the internal oblique tendon, and with this passes in front of\r\nthe rectus. The fibrous structure thus constituted by the union of the\r\ntendons of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, e f, is named\r\nthe \"conjoined tendon.\"\r\n\r\nThe conjoined tendon, f, Plates 30 and 31, appears as a continuation of\r\nthe linea semilunaris, for this latter is in itself a result of the\r\nunion of the tendons of the abdominal muscles at the external border of\r\nthe rectus. As the conjoined tendon curves so far outwards to its\r\ninsertion into the pectineal ridge of the pubic bone, as to occupy a\r\nsituation immediately behind the external ring, it thereby fortifies\r\nthis part against the occurrence of a direct protrusion of the bowel.\r\nBut the breadth, as well as the density, of this tendon varies in\r\nseveral individuals, and these will accordingly be more or less liable\r\nto the occurrence of hernia.\r\n\r\nThe arched inferior border of the transverse muscle, F, Plate 30,\r\nexpresses by its abrupt termination that some part is wanting to it; and\r\nthis appearance, together with the fact that the fibres of this part of\r\nthe muscle blend with those of the internal oblique and cremaster, and\r\ncannot be separated except by severing the connexion, at once suggests\r\nthe idea that the cremaster is a derivation from both these muscles.\r\n\r\nAssuming this to be the case, therefore, it follows that when the\r\ndissector removes the cremaster from the space L h, he himself causes\r\nthis vacancy in the muscular parietes of the groin to occur, and at the\r\nsame time gives unnatural definition to the lower border of the\r\ntransverse and oblique muscles. In a dissection so conducted, the cord\r\nis made to assume the variable positions which anatomists report it to\r\nhave in respect to the neighbouring muscles. But when we view nature as\r\nshe is, and not as fashioned by the scalpel, we never fail to find an\r\neasy explanation of her form.\r\n\r\nIn the foetus, prior to the descent of the testicle, the cremaster\r\nmuscle does not exist. (Cloquet, op cit.) From this we infer, that those\r\nparts of the muscles, E F, Plate 30, which at a subsequent period are\r\nconverted into a cremaster, entirely occupy the space L h. In the adult\r\nbody, where one of the testicles has been arrested in the inguinal\r\ncanal, the muscles, E F, do not present a defined arched margin, above\r\nthe vacant space L h, but are continued (as in the foetus) as low down\r\nas the external abdominal ring. In the adult, where the testicle has\r\ndescended to the scrotum, the cremaster exists, and is serially\r\ncontinuous with the muscles, E F, covering the space L h; the meaning of\r\nwhich is, that the cremasteric parts of the muscles, E F, cover this\r\nspace. The name cremaster therefore must not cancel the fact that the\r\nfibres so named are parts of the muscles, E F. Again, in the female\r\ndevoid of a cremaster, the muscles, E F, present of their full\r\nquantities, having sustained no diminution of their bulk by the\r\nformation of a cremaster. But when an external inguinal hernia occurs in\r\nthe female body, the bowel during its descent carries before it a\r\ncremasteric covering at the expense of the muscles E F, just in the same\r\nway as the testicle does in the foetus. (Cloquet.)\r\n\r\nFrom the above-mentioned facts, viewed comparatively, it seems that the\r\nfollowing inferences may be legitimately drawn:--1st, that the space L h\r\ndoes not naturally exist devoid of a muscular covering; for, in fact,\r\nthe cremaster overlies this situation; 2nd, that the name cremaster is\r\none given to the lower fibres of the internal oblique and transverse\r\nmuscles which cover this space; and 3rd, that to separate the\r\ncremasteric elongation of these muscles, and then describe them as\r\npresenting a defined arched margin, an inch or two above Poupart's\r\nligament, is an act as arbitrary on the part of the dissector as if he\r\nwere to subdivide these muscles still more, and, while regarding the\r\nsubdivisions as different structures, to give them names of different\r\nsignification. When once we consent to regard the cremaster as\r\nconstituted of the fibres originally proper to the muscles, E F, we then\r\nare led to the discovery of the true relations of the cord in respect to\r\nthese muscles.\r\n\r\nOn removing the transverse muscle, we expose the inguinal part of the\r\ntransversalis fascia--the sixth inguinal layer, L h, Plate 30--K k,\r\nPlate 31. This fascia or membrane affords a general lining to the\r\nabdominal walls, in some parts of which it presents of a denser and\r\nstronger texture than in others. It is stretched over the abdomen\r\nbetween the muscles and the peritonaeum. The fascia iliaca, the fascia\r\npelvica, and the fascia transversalis, are only regional divisions of\r\nthe one general membrane. On viewing this fascia in its totality, I find\r\nit to exhibit many features in common with those other fibrous\r\nstructures which envelope serous cavities. The transversalis fascia\r\nsupports externally the peritonaeum, in the same way as the dura mater\r\nsupports the arachnoid membrane, or as the pleural fascia supports the\r\nserous pleura. While the serous membranes form completely shut sacs, the\r\nfibrous membranes which lie external to those sacs are pierced by the\r\nvessels which course between them and the serous membranes, and afford\r\nsheaths or envelopes for these vessels in their passage from the\r\ninterior to the external parts. The sheath, H h, Plates 30 and 31, which\r\nsurrounds the spermatic vessels, and the sheath, R, Plate 31, which\r\nenvelopes the crural vessels, are elongations of the fascia\r\ntransversalis.\r\n\r\nIn the groin, the transversalis fascia, K k, Plate 31, presents, in\r\ngeneral, so dense a texture as to offer considerable resistance to\r\nvisceral pressure. Here it is stretched between the transverse muscle,\r\nF, Plate 31, and the peritonaeum, I. It adheres to the external surface\r\nof the peritonaeum, and to the internal surface of the transverse\r\nmuscle, by means of an intervening cellular tissue. It is connected\r\nbelow to Poupart's ligament, along the line of which it joins the fascia\r\niliaca. It lines the lower posterior aspect of the rectus muscle, where\r\nthis is devoid of its sheath; and it is incorporated with f, the\r\nconjoined tendon, thereby fencing the external abdominal ring.\r\nImmediately above the middle of Poupart's ligament, this membrane, at\r\nthe point marked h, Plate 30, is pouched into a canal-shaped elongation,\r\nwhich invests the spermatic vessels as far as the testicle in the\r\nscrotum; and to this elongation is given the names \"fascia spermatica\r\ninterna\" (Cooper), \"fascia infundibuliform\" (Cloquet). The same part,\r\nwhen it encloses an external oblique hernia, is named \"fascia propria.\"\r\nThe neck or inlet of this funnel-shaped canal is oval, and named the\r\n\"internal abdominal ring.\" As this ring looks towards the interior of\r\nthe abdomen, and forms the entrance of the funnel-shaped canal, it\r\ncannot of course be seen from before until we slit open this canal.\r\nCompare the parts marked H h in Plates 30 and 31.\r\n\r\nThe inguinal and iliac portions of the fascia transversalis join along\r\nthe line of Poupart's ligament, A C. The iliac vessels, in their passage\r\nto the thigh, encounter the fascia at the middle third of the crural\r\narch formed by the ligament, and take an investment (the sheath, R) from\r\nthe fascia. The fore part of this sheath is mentioned as formed by the\r\nfascia transversalis--the back part by the fascia iliaca; but these\r\ndistinctions are merely nominal, and it is therefore unnecessary to\r\ndwell upon them. The sheath of the femoral vessels is also\r\nfunnel-shaped, and surrounds them on all sides. Its broad entrance lies\r\nbeneath the middle of Poupart's ligament. Several septa are met with in\r\nits interior. These serve to separate the femoral vessels from each\r\nother. The femoral vein, O, Plate 30, is separated from the falciform\r\nmargin, S s, of the saphenous opening by one of these septa. Between\r\nthis septum and the falx an interval occurs, and through it the crural\r\nhernia usually descends. These parts will be more particularly noticed\r\nwhen considering the anatomy of crural hernia.\r\n\r\nBeneath the fascia transversalis is found the subserous cellular\r\nmembrane, which serves as a connecting medium between the fascia and the\r\nperitonaeum. This cellular membrane may be considered as the seventh\r\ninguinal layer. It is described by Scarpa (sull' Ernie) as forming an\r\ninvestment for the spermatic vessels inside the sheath, where it is\r\ncopious, especially in old inguinal hernia. It is also sometimes mixed\r\nwith fatty tissue. In it is found embedded the infantile cord--the\r\nremains of the upper part of the peritoneal tunica vaginalis--a\r\nstructure which will be considered in connexion with congenital herniae.\r\n\r\nBy removing the subserous cellular tissue, we lay bare the peritonaeum,\r\nwhich forms the eighth layer of the inguinal region. Upon it the\r\nepigastric and spermatic vessels are seen to rest. These vessels course\r\nbetween the fascia transversalis and the peritonaeum. The internal ring\r\nwhich is formed in the fascia, K h, may be now seen to be closed by the\r\nperitonaeum, I. The inguinal canal, therefore, does not, in the normal\r\nstate of these parts, communicate with the general serous cavity; and\r\nhere it must be evident that before the bowel, which is situated\r\nimmediately behind the peritonaeum, I, can be received into the canal, H\r\nh, it must either rupture that membrane, or elongate it in the form of a\r\nsac.\r\n\r\nThe exact position which the epigastric, L, Plate 31, and spermatic\r\nvessels, M, bear in respect to the internal ring, is a point of chief\r\nimportance in the surgical anatomy of the groin; for the various forms\r\nof herniae which protrude through this part have an intimate relation to\r\nthese vessels. The epigastric artery, in general, arises from the\r\nexternal iliac, close above the middle of Poupart's ligament, and\r\nascends the inguinal wall in an oblique course towards the navel. It\r\napplies itself to the inner border of the internal ring, and here it is\r\ncrossed on its outer side by the spermatic vessels, as these are about\r\nto enter the inguinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe inguinal canal is the natural channel through which the spermatic\r\nvessels traverse the groin on their way to the testicle in the scrotum.\r\nIn the remarks which have been already made respecting the several\r\nlayers of structures found in the groin, I endeavoured to realize the\r\nidea of an inguinal canal as consisting of elongations of these layers\r\ninvaginated the one within the other, the outermost layer being the\r\nintegument of the groin elongated into the scrotal skin, whilst the\r\ninnermost layer consisted of the transversalis fascia elongated into the\r\nfascia spermatica interna, or sheath. The peritonaeum, which forms the\r\neighth layer of the groin, was seen to be drawn across the internal ring\r\nof this canal above in such a way as to close it completely, whilst all\r\nthe other layers, seven in number, were described as being continued\r\nover the spermatic vessels in the form of funnel-shaped investments, as\r\nfar down as the testicle.\r\n\r\nWith the ideas of an inguinal canal thus naturally constituted, I need\r\nnot hesitate to assert that the form, the extent, and the boundaries of\r\nthe inguinal canal, as given by the descriptive anatomist, are purely\r\nconventional, and do not exist until after dissection; for which reason,\r\nand also because the form and condition of these parts so described and\r\ndissected do not appear absolutely to correspond in any two individuals,\r\nI omit to mention the scale of measurements drawn up by some eminent\r\nsurgeons, with the object of determining the precise relative position\r\nof the several parts of the inguinal region.\r\n\r\nThe existence of an inguinal canal consisting, as I have described it,\r\nof funnel-shaped elongations from the several inguinal layers continued\r\nover the cord as far as the testicle, renders the adult male especially\r\nliable to hernial protrusions at this part. The oblique direction of the\r\ncanal is, in some measure, a safeguard against these accidents; but this\r\nobliquity is not of the same degree in all bodies, and hence some are\r\nnaturally more prone to herniae than others.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 30 & 31.\r\n\r\nPLATE 30.\r\n\r\nA.

The innermost layer of the inguinal region is the\r\nperitonaeum, and from this membrane the intestine, when about to\r\nprotrude, derives its first covering. This covering constitutes the\r\nhernial sac. Almost all varieties of inguinal herniae are said to be\r\nenveloped in a sac, or elongation of the peritonaeum. This is accounted\r\nas the general rule. The exceptions to the rule are mentioned as\r\noccurring in the following modes: 1st, the caecum and sigmoid flexure of\r\nthe colon, which are devoid of mesenteries, and only partially covered\r\nby the peritonaeum, may slip down behind this membrane, and become\r\nhernial; 2nd, the inguinal part of the peritonaeum may suffer rupture,\r\nand allow the intestine to protrude through the opening. When a hernia\r\noccurs under either of these circumstances, it will be found deprived of\r\na sac.\r\n\r\nAll the blood vessels and nerves of the abdomen lie external to the\r\nperitonaeum. Those vessels which traverse the abdomen on their way to\r\nthe external organs course outside the peritonaeum; and at the places\r\nwhere they enter the abdominal parietes, the membrane is reflected from\r\nthem. This disposition of the peritonaeum in respect to the spermatic\r\nand iliac vessels is exhibited in Plate 32.\r\n\r\nThe part of the peritonaeum which lines the inguinal parietes does not\r\n(in the normal state of the adult body) exhibit any aperture\r\ncorresponding to that named the internal ring. The membrane is in this\r\nplace, as elsewhere, continuous throughout, being extended over the\r\nring, as also over other localities, where subjacent structures may be\r\nin part wanting. It is in these places, where the membrane happens to be\r\nunsupported, that herniae are most liable to occur. And it must be\r\nadded, that the natural form of the internal surface of the groin is\r\nsuch as to guide the viscera under pressure directly against those parts\r\nwhich are the weakest.\r\n\r\nThe inner surface of the groin is divided into two pouches or fossae, by\r\nan intervening crescentic fold of the peritonaeum, which corresponds\r\nwith the situation of the epigastric vessels. This fold is formed by the\r\nepigastric vessels and the umbilical ligament, which, being tenser and\r\nshorter than the peritonaeum, thereby cause this membrane to project.\r\nThe outer fossa represents a triangular space, the apex of which is\r\nbelow, at P; the base being formed by the fibres of the transverse\r\nmuscle above; the inner side by the epigastric artery; and the outer\r\nside by Poupart's ligament. The apex of this inverted triangle is\r\nopposite the internal ring. The inner fossa is bounded by the epigastric\r\nartery externally; by the margin of the rectus muscle internally; and by\r\nthe os pubis and inner end of Poupart's ligament inferiorly. The inner\r\nfossa is opposite the external abdominal ring, and is known as the\r\ntriangle of Hesselbach.\r\n\r\nThe two peritonaeal fossae being named external and internal, in\r\nreference to the situation of the epigastric vessels, we find that the\r\ntwo varieties of inguinal herniae which occur in these fossae are named\r\nexternal and internal also, in reference to the same part.\r\n\r\nThe external inguinal hernia, so called from its commencing in the outer\r\nperitonaeal fossa, on the outer side of the epigastric artery, takes a\r\ncovering from the peritonaeum of this place, and pushes forward into the\r\ninternal abdominal ring at the point marked P, Plate 32. In this place,\r\nthe incipient hernia or bubonocele, covered by its sac, lies on the\r\nforepart of the spermatic vessels, and becomes invested by those same\r\ncoverings which constitute the inguinal canal, through which these\r\nvessels pass. In this stage of the hernia, its situation in respect to\r\nthe epigastric artery is truly external, and in respect to the spermatic\r\nvessels, anterior, while the protruded intestine itself is separated\r\nfrom actual contact with either of these vessels by its proper sac. The\r\nbubonocele, projecting through the internal ring at the situation marked\r\nF, (Plate 33,) midway between A, the anterior iliac spine, and I, the\r\npubic spine, continues to increase in size; but as its further progress\r\nfrom behind directly forwards becomes arrested by the tense resisting\r\naponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, h, it changes its course\r\nobliquely inwards along the canal, traversing this canal with the\r\nspermatic vessels, which still lie behind it, and, lastly, makes its\r\nexit at the external ring, H. The obliquity of this course, pursued by\r\nthe hernia, from the internal to the external ring, has gained for it\r\nthe name of oblique hernia. In this stage of the hernial protrusion, the\r\nonly part of it which may be truly named external is the neck of its\r\nsac, F, for the elongated body, G, of the hernia lies now actually in\r\nfront of the epigastric artery, P, and this vessel is separated from the\r\nanterior wall of the canal, H h, by an interval equal to the bulk of the\r\nhernia. While the hernia occupies the canal, F H, without projecting\r\nthrough the external ring, H, it is named \"incomplete.\" When it has\r\npassed the external ring, H, so as to form a tumour of the size and in\r\nthe situation of f g, it is named \"complete.\" When, lastly, the hernia\r\nhas extended itself so far as to occupy the whole length of the cord,\r\nand reach the scrotum, it is termed \"scrotal hernia.\" These names, it\r\nwill be seen, are given only to characterise the several stages of the\r\none kind of hernia--viz., that which commences to form at a situation\r\nexternal to the epigastric artery, and, after following the course of\r\nthe spermatic vessels through the inguinal canal, at length terminates\r\nin the scrotum.\r\n\r\nThe external inguinal hernia having entered the canal, P, (Plate 32,) at\r\na situation immediately in front of the spermatic vessels, continues, in\r\nthe several stages of its descent, to hold the same relation to these\r\nvessels through the whole length of the canal, even as far as the\r\ntesticle in the scrotum. This hernia, however, when of long standing and\r\nlarge size, is known to separate the spermatic vessels from each other\r\nin such a way, that some are found to lie on its fore part--others to\r\nits outer side. However great may be the size of this hernia, even when\r\nit becomes scrotal, still the testicle is invariably found below it.\r\nThis fact is accounted for by the circumstance, that the lower end of\r\nthe spermatic envelopes is attached so firmly to the coats of the\r\ntesticle as to prevent the hernia from either distending and elongating\r\nthem to a level below this organ, or from entering the cavity of the\r\ntunica vaginalis.\r\n\r\nThe external form of inguinal hernia is, comparatively speaking, but\r\nrarely seen in the female. When it does occur in this sex, its position,\r\ninvestments, and course through the inguinal canal, where it accompanies\r\nthe round ligament of the uterus, are the same as in the male. When the\r\nhernia escapes through the external abdominal ring of the female groin,\r\nit is found to lodge in the labium pudendi. In the male body, the\r\ntesticle and spermatic cord, which have carried before them investments\r\nderived from all the layers of the inguinal region, have, as it were,\r\nalready marked out the track to be followed by the hernia, and prepared\r\nfor it its several coverings. The muscular parietes of the male inguinal\r\nregion, from which the loose cremaster muscle has been derived, have by\r\nthis circumstance become weakened, and hence the more frequent\r\noccurrence of external inguinal hernia in the male. But in the female,\r\nwhere no such process has taken place, and where a cremaster does not\r\nexist at the expense of the internal oblique and transverse muscles, the\r\ninguinal parietes remain more compact, and are less liable to suffer\r\ndistention in the course of the uterine ligament.\r\n\r\nThe internal inguinal hernia takes its peritonaeal covering (the sac)\r\nfrom the inner fossa, Q R, Plate 32, internal to the epigastric artery,\r\nand forces directly forwards through the external abdominal ring,\r\ncarrying investments from each of such structures as it meets with in\r\nthis locality of the groin. As the external ring, H, Plate 34, is\r\nopposite the inner peritonaeal fossa, Q R, Plate 32, this hernia, which\r\nprotrudes thus immediately from behind forwards, is also named direct.\r\nIn this way these two varieties of hernia, (the external, Plate 33, and\r\nthe internal, Plate 34,) though commencing in different situations, P\r\nand R, Plate 32, within the abdomen, arrive at the same place--viz., the\r\nexternal ring, H, Plates 33 and 34. The coverings of the internal\r\nhernia, Plate 34, though not derived exactly from the same locality as\r\nthose which invest the cord and the external variety, are, nevertheless,\r\nbut different parts of the same structures; these are, 1st, the\r\nperitonaeum, G, which forms its sac; 2nd, the pubic part of the fascia\r\ntransversalis; 3rd, the conjoined tendon itself, or (according as the\r\nhernia may occur further from the mesial line) the cremaster, which, in\r\ncommon with the internal oblique and transverse muscles, terminates in\r\nthis tendon; 4th, the external spermatic fascia, derived from the\r\nmargins of the external ring; 5th, the superficial fascia and\r\ninteguments.\r\n\r\nThe coverings of the internal inguinal hernia are (as to number)\r\nvariously described by authors. Thus with respect to the conjoined\r\ntendon, the hernia is said, in some instances, to take an investment of\r\nthis structure; in others, to pass through a cleft in its fibres; in\r\nothers, to escape by its outer margin. Again, the cremaster muscle is\r\nstated by some to cover this hernia; by others, to be rarely met with,\r\nas forming one of its coverings; and by others, never. Lastly, it is\r\ndoubted by some whether this hernia is even covered by a protrusion of\r\nthe fascia transversalis in all instances. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Lawrence (Treatise on Ruptures) remarks, \"How often it\r\nmay be invested by a protrusion of the fascia transversalis, I cannot\r\nhitherto determine.\" Mr. Stanley has presented to St. Bartholomew's\r\nHospital several specimens of this hernia invested by the fascia.\r\nHesselbach speaks of the fascia as being always present. Cloquet\r\nmentions it as being present always, except in such cases as where, by\r\nbeing ruptured, the sac protrudes through it. Langenbeck states that the\r\nfascia is constantly protruded as a covering to this hernia: \"Quia\r\nhernia inguinalis interna non in canalis abdominalis aperturam internam\r\ntransit, tunicam vaginalem communem intrare nequit; parietem autem\r\ncanalis abdominalis internum aponeuroticum, in quo fovea inguinalis\r\ninterna, et qui ex adverso annulo abdominali est, ante se per annulum\r\ntrudit.\" (Comment, ad illust. Herniarum, &c.) Perhaps the readiest and\r\nsurest explanation which can be given to these differences of opinion\r\nmay be had from the following remark:--\"Culter enim semper has partes\r\nextricat, quae involucro adeo inhaerent, ut pro lubitu musculum\r\n(membranam) efformare queas unde magnam illam inter anatomicos\r\ndiscrepantiam ortam conjicio.\" (Camper. Icones Herniarum.)]\r\n\r\nThe variety in the number of investments of the internal inguinal hernia\r\n(especially as regards the presence or absence of the conjoined tendon\r\nand cremaster) appears to me to be dependent, 1st, upon the position\r\nwhereat this hernia occurs; 2nd, upon the state of the parts through\r\nwhich it passes; and 3rd, upon the manner in which the dissection\r\nhappens to be conducted.\r\n\r\nThe precise relations which the internal hernia holds in respect to the\r\nepigastric and spermatic vessels are also mainly dependent (as in the\r\nexternal variety) upon the situation where it traverses the groin. The\r\nepigastric artery courses outside the neck of its sac, sometimes in\r\nclose connexion with this part--at other times, at some distance from\r\nit, according as the neck may happen to be wide and near the vessel, or\r\nnarrow, and removed from it nearer to the median line. At the external\r\nring, H, (Plate 34,) the sac of this hernia, g, protrudes on the inner\r\nside of the spermatic vessels, f; and the size of the hernia distending\r\nthe ring, removes these vessels at a considerable interval from, I, the\r\ncrista pubis. At the ring, H, (Plate 34,) the investments, g f, of the\r\ndirect hernia are not always distinct from those of the oblique hernia,\r\ng f, (Plate 33); for whilst in both varieties the intestine and the\r\nspermatic vessels are separated from actual contact by the sac, yet it\r\nis true that the direct hernia, as well as the oblique, may occupy the\r\ninguinal canal. It is in relation to the epigastric artery alone that\r\nthe direct hernia differs essentially from the oblique variety; for I\r\nfind that both may be enclosed in the same structures as invest the\r\nspermatic vessels.\r\n\r\nThe external ring of the male groin is larger than that of the female;\r\nand this circumstance, with others of a like nature, may account for the\r\nfact, that the female is very rarely the subject of the direct hernia.\r\nIn the male, the direct hernia is found to occur much less frequently\r\nthan the oblique, and this we might, a priori, expect, from the\r\nanatomical disposition of the parts. But it is true, nevertheless, that\r\nthe part where the direct hernia occurs is not defended so completely in\r\nsome male bodies as it is in others. The conjoined tendon, which is\r\ndescribed as shielding the external ring, is in some cases very weak,\r\nand in others so narrow, as to offer but little support to this part of\r\nthe groin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 32, 33, & 34.\r\n\r\nPLATE 32.\r\n\r\nA.

The nearer the one approaches the\r\nusual place of the other, the more likely are they to be mistaken the\r\none for the other. An internal hernia may enter the inguinal canal, and\r\nbecome oblique; while an external hernia, though occupying the canal,\r\nmay become direct. It is only when these herniae occur at the situations\r\ncommonly described, and where they manifest their broadest contrast,\r\nthat the following diagnostic signs can be observed.\r\n\r\nThe external bubonocele, H, Plate 37, G, Plate 38, when recently formed,\r\nmay be detected at a situation midway between the iliac and pubic\r\nspinous processes, where it has entered the internal ring. When the\r\nhernia extends itself from this part, its course will be obliquely\r\ninwards, corresponding with the direction of the inguinal canal. While\r\nit still occupies the canal without passing through the external ring,\r\nit is rendered obscure by the restraint of the external oblique tendon;\r\nbut yet a degree of fulness may be felt in this situation. When the\r\nhernia has passed the external ring, T, Plate 36, it dilates\r\nconsiderably, and assumes the form of an oblong swelling, H, Plate 36,\r\nbehind which the spermatic vessels are situated. When it has become\r\nscrotal, the cord will be found still on its posterior aspect, while the\r\ntesticle itself occupies a situation directly below the swelling.\r\n\r\nThe internal hernia, H, Plate 38, also traverses the external ring, T,\r\nwhere it assumes a globular shape, and sometimes projects so far\r\ninwards, over the pubes, C, as to conceal the crista of this bone. As\r\nthe direction of this hernia is immediately from behind forwards, the\r\ninguinal canal near the internal ring is found empty, unswollen. The\r\ncord, Q, lies external to and somewhat over the fore part of this\r\nhernia; and the testicle does not occupy a situation exactly beneath the\r\nfundus of the sac, (as it does in the external hernia,) but is found to\r\nbe placed either at its fore part or its outer side. This difference as\r\nto the relative position of the cord and testicle in both these forms of\r\nherniae, is accounted for under the supposition that whilst the external\r\nvariety descends inside the sheaths of the inguinal canal, the internal\r\nvariety does not. But this statement cannot apply to all cases of\r\ninternal hernia, for this also occasionally enters the canal. Both forms\r\nof inguinal herniae may exist at the same time on the same side: the\r\nexternal, G, Plate 38, being a bubonocele, still occupying the inguinal\r\ncanal; while the internal, H, protrudes through the external ring, T, in\r\nthe usual way. In this form of hernia--a compound of the oblique and\r\ndirect--while the parts remain still covered by the integuments, it must\r\nbe difficult to tell its nature, or to distinguish any mark by which to\r\ndiagnose the case from one of the external variety, H, Plate 36, which,\r\non entering the canal at the internal ring, protrudes at the external\r\nring. In both cases, the swelling produced in the groin must be exactly\r\nof the same size and shape. The epigastric artery in the case where the\r\ntwo herniae co-exist lies between them, holding in its usual position\r\nwith respect to each when occurring separately--that is, on the outer\r\nside of the internal hernia, H, and on the inner side of the external\r\none, G; and the external hernia, G, not having descended the canal as\r\nfar as the external ring, T, allows the internal hernia, H, to assume\r\nits usual position with respect to the cord, Q. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Cases of this double hernia (external and internal) have been\r\nmet with by Wilmer, Arnaud, Sandifort, Richter, and others. A plurality\r\nof the same variety of hernia may also occur on the same side. A\r\ncomplete and incomplete external inguinal hernia existing in the one\r\ngroin, is recorded by Mr. Aston Key in his edition of Sir Astley\r\nCooper's work on Hernia. Sir Astley Cooper states his having met with\r\nthree internal inguinal herniae in each inguinal region. (Ing. et\r\nCongenit. Hernire.) ]\r\n\r\nReturning, however, to the more frequent conditions of inguinal\r\nhernia--viz., those in which either the direct or the oblique variety\r\noccurs alone--it should be remembered that a hernia originally oblique,\r\nH, Plates 35 and 37, may, when of long standing, and having attained a\r\nlarge size, destroy, by its gravitation, the obliquity of the inguinal\r\ncanal to such a degree as to bring the internal, H, Plate 35, opposite\r\nto the external ring, as at I, and thereby exhibit all the appearance of\r\na hernia originally direct, I, Plate 37. In such a case, the epigastric\r\nartery, F, which lies on the outer side of the neck of a truly direct\r\nhernia, I, Plate 37, will be found to course on the inner side, G, of\r\nthe neck of this false-seeming direct hernia, I, Plate 35.\r\n\r\nIn the trial made for replacing the protruded bowel by the taxis, two\r\ncircumstances should be remembered in order to facilitate this object:\r\n1st, the abdominal parietes should be relaxed by supporting the trunk\r\nforward, and at the same time flexing the thigh on the trunk; 2nd, as\r\nevery complete hernial protrusion becomes distended more or less beyond\r\nthe seat of stricture--wherever this may happen to be--its reduction by\r\nthe taxis should be attempted, with gradual, gentle, equable pressure,\r\nso that the sac may be first emptied of its fluid. That part of the\r\nhernia which protruded last should be replaced first. The direction in\r\nwhich the hernia protrudes must always determine the direction in which\r\nit is to be reduced. If it be the external or oblique variety, the\r\nviscus is to be pushed upwards, outwards, and backwards; if it be the\r\ninternal or direct variety, it is to be reduced by pressure, made\r\nupwards and backwards. Pressure made in this latter direction will serve\r\nfor the reduction of that hernia which, from being originally external\r\nand oblique, has assumed the usual position of the internal or direct\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThe seat of the stricture in an external inguinal hernia is found to be\r\nsituated either at the internal ring, corresponding to the neck of the\r\nsac, or at the external ring. Between these two points, which \"bound the\r\ncanal,\" and which are to be regarded merely as passive agents in causing\r\nstricture of the protruding bowel, the lower parts of the transversalis\r\nand internal oblique muscles embrace the herniary sac, and are known at\r\ntimes to be the cause of its active strangulation or spasm.\r\n\r\nThe seat of stricture in an internal hernia may be either at the neck of\r\nits sac, I, Plate 37, or at the external ring, T, Plate 38; and\r\naccording to the locality where this hernia enters the inguinal wall,\r\nthe nature of its stricture will vary. If the hernia pass through a\r\ncleft in the conjoined tendon, f, Plate 38, this structure will\r\nconstrict its neck all around. If it pass on the outer margin of this\r\ntendon, then the neck of the sac, bending inwards in order to gain the\r\nexternal ring, will be constricted against the sharp resisting edge of\r\nthe tendon. Again, if the hernia enter the inguinal wall close to the\r\nepigastric artery, it will find its way into the inguinal canal, become\r\ninvested by the structures forming this part, and here it may suffer\r\nactive constriction from the muscular fibres of the transverse and\r\ninternal oblique or their cremasteric parts. The external ring may be\r\nconsidered as always causing some degree of pressure on the hernia which\r\npasses through it.\r\n\r\nIn both kinds of inguinal herniae, the neck of the sac is described as\r\nbeing occasionally the seat of stricture, and it certainly is so; but\r\nnever from a cause originating in itself per se, or independently of\r\nadjacent structures. The form of the sac of a hernia is influenced by\r\nthe parts through which it passes, or which it pushes and elongates\r\nbefore itself. Its neck, H, Plate 37, is narrow at the internal ring of\r\nthe fascia transversalis, because this ring is itself narrowed; it is\r\nagain narrowed at the external ring, T, Plate 36, from the same cause.\r\nThe neck of the sac of a direct hernia, I, Plate 37, being formed in the\r\nspace of the separated fibres of the conjoined tendon, or the pubic part\r\nof the transversalis fascia, while the sac itself passes through the\r\nresisting tendinous external ring, is equal to the capacities of these\r\noutlets. But if these constricting outlets did not exist, the neck of\r\nthe sac would be also wanting. When, however, the neck of the sac has\r\nexisted in the embrace of these constricting parts for a considerable\r\nperiod--when it suffers inflammation and undergoes chronic\r\nthickening--then, even though we liberate the stricture of the internal\r\nring or the external, the neck of the sac will be found to maintain its\r\nnarrow diameter, and to have become itself a real seat of stricture. It\r\nis in cases of this latter kind of stricture that experience has\r\ndemonstrated the necessity of opening the sac (a proceeding otherwise\r\nnot only needless, but objectionable) and dividing its constricted neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the stricture may be seated in the neck of the sac\r\nindependent of the internal ring, and also that the duplicature of the\r\ncontained bowel may be adherent to the neck or other part of the\r\ninterior, or that firm bands of false membrane may exist so as to\r\nconstrict the bowel within the sac, are circumstances which require that\r\nthis should be opened, and the state of its contained parts examined,\r\nprior to the replacement of the bowel in the abdomen. If the bowel were\r\nadherent to the neck of the sac, we might, when trying to reduce it by\r\nthe taxis, produce visceral invagination; or while the stricture is in\r\nthe neck of the sac, if we were to return this and its contents en masse\r\n(the \"reduction en bloc\") into the abdomen, it is obvious that the bowel\r\nwould be still in a state of strangulation, though free of the internal\r\nring or other opening in the inguinal wall.\r\n\r\nThe operation for the division of the stricture by the knife is\r\nconducted in the following way: an incision is to be made through the\r\ninteguments, adipous membrane, and superficial fascia, of a length and\r\ndepth sufficient to expose the tendon of the external oblique muscle for\r\nan inch or so above the external ring; and the hernia for the same\r\nextent below the ring. The length of the incision will require to be\r\nvaried according to circumstances, but its direction should be oblique\r\nwith that of the hernia itself, and also over the centre of its\r\nlongitudinal axis, so as to avoid injuring the spermatic vessels. If the\r\nconstriction of the hernia be caused by the external ring, a director is\r\nto be inserted beneath this part, and a few of its fibres divided. But\r\nwhen the stricture is produced by either of the muscles which lie\r\nbeneath the aponeurosis of the external oblique, it will be necessary to\r\ndivide this part in order to expose and incise them.\r\n\r\nWhen the thickened and indurated neck of the sac is felt to be the cause\r\nof the strangulation, or when the bowel cannot be replaced, in\r\nconsequence of adhesions which it may have contracted with some part of\r\nthe sac, it then becomes necessary to open this envelope. And now the\r\nposition of the epigastric artery is to be remembered, so as to avoid\r\nwounding it in the incision about to be made through the constricted\r\nneck of the sac. The artery being situated on the inner side of the neck\r\nof the sac of an oblique hernia, requires the incision to be made\r\noutwards from the external side of the neck; whereas in the direct\r\nhernia, the artery being on its outer side, the incision should be\r\nconducted inwards from the inner side of the neck. But as the external\r\nor oblique hernia may by its weight, in process of time, gravitate so\r\nfar inwards as to assume the position and appearance of a hernia\r\noriginally direct and internal, and as by this change of place the\r\noblique hernia, becoming direct as to position, does not at the same\r\ntime become internal in respect to the epigastric artery,--for this\r\nvessel, F, Plate 35, has been borne inwards to the place, G, where it\r\nstill lies, internal to the neck of the sac, and since, moreover, it is\r\nvery difficult to diagnose a case of this kind with positive certainty,\r\nit is therefore recommended to incise the stricture at the neck of the\r\nsac in a line carried directly upwards. (Sir Astley Cooper.) It will be\r\nseen, however, on referring to Plates 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, & 38, that\r\nan incision carried obliquely upwards towards the umbilicus would be\r\nmuch more likely to avoid the epigastric artery through all its varying\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 35, 36, 37, & 38.\r\n\r\nPLATE 35.\r\n\r\nA.

Fig. 1--The descent of the testicle from the loins to the\r\nscrotum.--The foetal abdomen and scrotum form one general cavity, and\r\nare composed of parts which are structurally identical. The cutaneous,\r\nfascial, muscular, and membranous layers of the abdominal parietes are\r\ncontinued into those of the scrotum. At the fifth month of foetal life,\r\nthe testicle, 3, is situated in the loins beneath the kidney, 2. The\r\ntesticle is then numbered amongst the abdominal viscera, and, like\r\nthese, it is developed external to the peritonaeal membrane, which forms\r\nan envelope for it. At the back and sides of the testicle, where the\r\nperitonaeum is reflected from it, a small membranous fold or mesentery\r\n(mesorchium, Seiler) is formed, and between the layers of this the\r\nnerves and vessels enter the organ, the nerves being derived from the\r\nneighbouring sympathetic ganglia (aortic plexus), while the arteries and\r\nveins spring directly from the main abdominal bloodvessels. It being\r\npredetermined that the testicle, 3, should migrate from the loins to the\r\nscrotum, 6 a, 7, at a period included between the sixth and ninth month,\r\ncertain structural changes are at this time already effected for its\r\nsure and easy passage. By the time that the testis, 5, is about to enter\r\nthe internal inguinal ring, 6 a, (seventh or eighth month,) a process or\r\npouch of the peritonaeal membrane (processus vaginalis) has already\r\ndescended through this aperture into the scrotum, and the testicle\r\nfollows it.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the testis is effected by a very slow and gradual process\r\nof change. (Tout va par degres dans la nature, et rien par\r\nsauts.--Bonnet.) But how, or by what distinct and active structural\r\nagent, this descent is effected, or whether there does exist, in fact,\r\nany such agent as that which anatomists name \"gubernaculum testis,\" are\r\nquestions which appear to me by no means settled.[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote:  Dr. Carpenter (Principles of Human Physiology) remarks, that\r\n\"the cause of this descent is not very clear. It can scarcely be due\r\nmerely, as some have supposed, to the contraction of the gubernaculum,\r\nsince that does not contain any fibrous structure until after the\r\nlowering of the testis has commenced.\" Dr. Sharpey (Quain's Anatomy, 5th\r\nedition) observes, that \"the office of the gubernaculum is yet\r\nimperfectly understood.\" The opinions of these two distinguished\r\nphysiologists will doubtless be regarded as an impartial estimate of the\r\nresults of the researches prosecuted in reference to these questions by\r\nHaller, Camper, Hunter, Arnaud, Lobstein, Meckel, Paletta, Wrisberg,\r\nVicq d'Azyr, Brugnone, Tumiati, Seiler, Girardi, Cooper, Bell, Weber,\r\nCarus, Cloquet, Curling, and others. From my own observations, I am led\r\nto believe that no such muscular structure as a gubernaculum exists, and\r\ntherefore that the descent of the testis is the effect of another cause.\r\nLeaving these matters, however, to the consideration of the\r\nphysiologist, it is sufficient for the surgeon to know that the testis\r\nin its transition derives certain coverings from the parietes of the\r\ngroin, and that a communication is thereby established between the\r\nscrotal and abdominal cavities. ]\r\n\r\nThe general lining membrane of the foetal abdomen is composed of two\r\nlayers--an outer one of fibrous, and an inner one of serous structure.\r\nOf these two layers, the abdominal viscera form for themselves a double\r\nenvelope. [Footnote]  The testis in the loins has a covering from both\r\nmembranes, and is still found to be enclosed by both, even when it has\r\ndescended to the scrotum. The two coverings of fibro-serous structure\r\nwhich surrounded the testis in the loins become respectively the tunica\r\nalbuginea and tunica vaginalis when the gland occupies the scrotal\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Langenbeck describes the peritonaeum as consisting of two\r\nlayers; one external and fibrous, another internal and serous. By the\r\nfirst, he means, I presume, that membrane of which the transversalis and\r\niliac fasciae are parts. (See Comment. de Periton. Structura, &c.) ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and leg, showing blood vessels, muscles\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 39--Figure 1\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 39, Fig. 2.--The testicle in the scrotum.--When the testicle, 5,\r\ndescends into the scrotum, 7, which happens in general at the time of\r\nbirth, the abdomino-scrotal fibro-serous membrane, 6 a, 6 d, is still\r\ncontinuous at the internal ring, 6 b. From this point downwards, to a\r\nlevel with the upper border of the testicle, the canal of communication\r\nbetween the scrotal cavity and the abdomen becomes elongated and\r\nsomewhat constricted. At this part, the canal itself consists, like the\r\nabdominal membrane above and the scrotal membrane below, of a fibrous\r\nand serous layer, the latter enclosed within the former. The serous\r\nlining of this canal is destined to be obliterated, while the outer\r\nfibrous membrane is designed to remain in its primitive condition. When\r\nthe serous canal contracts and degenerates to the form of a simple cord,\r\nit leaves the fibrous canal still continuous above with the fibrous\r\nmembrane (transversalis fascia) of the abdomen, and below with the\r\nfibrous envelope (tunica albuginea) of the testis; and at the adult\r\nperiod, this fibrous canal is known as the internal spermatic sheath, or\r\ninfundibuliform fascia enclosing the remains of the serous canal,\r\ntogether with the spermatic vessels, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 39--Figure 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 39, Fig. 3.--The serous tunica vaginalis is separated from the\r\nperitonaeum.--When the testicle, 7, has descended to the scrotum, the\r\nserous tube or lining of the inguinal canal and cord, 6 b, 6 c, closes\r\nand degenerates into a simple cord, (infantile spermatic cord,) and\r\nthereby the peritonaeal sac, 6 a, becomes distinct from the serous\r\ntunica vaginalis, 6 d. But the fibrous tube, or outer envelope of the\r\ninguinal canal, remains still pervious, and continues in this condition\r\nthroughout life. In the adult, we recognise this fibrous tube as the\r\ninfundibuliform fascia of the cord, or as forming the fascia propria of\r\nan external inguinal hernia. The anterior part of the fibrous spermatic\r\ntube descends from the fascia transversalis; the posterior part is\r\ncontinuous with the fascia iliaca. In relation to the testicle, the\r\nposterior part will be seen to be reflected over the body of the gland\r\nas the tunica albuginea, while the anterior part blends with the\r\ncellular tissue of the front wall of the scrotum. The tunica vaginalis,\r\n6 d, is now traceable as a distinct sac,[Footnote] closed on all sides,\r\nand reflected from the fore part of the testicle, above and below, to\r\nthe posterior aspect of the front wall of the scrotum.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Owen states that the Chimpanzee alone, amongst brute\r\nanimals, has the tunica vaginalis as a distinct sac.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 39--Figure 3\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 1.--The abdomino-scrotal serous lining remains continuous\r\nat the internal ring, and a congenital hydrocele is formed.--When the\r\nserous spermatic tube, 6 b, 6 c, remains pervious and continuous above\r\nwith the peritonaeum, 6 a, and below with the serous tunica vaginalis, 6\r\nd, the serous fluid of the abdomen will naturally gravitate to the most\r\ndepending part--viz., the tunica vaginalis; and thus a hydrocele is\r\nformed. This kind of hydrocele is named congenital, owing to the\r\ncircumstance that the natural process of obliteration, by which the\r\nperitonaeum becomes separated from the tunica vaginalis, has been, from\r\nsome cause, arrested. [Footnote 1]  As long as the canal of\r\ncommunication, 6 b, 6 c, between the tunica vaginalis, 6 d, and the\r\nperitonaeum 6 a, remains pervious, which it may be throughout life, this\r\nform of hydrocele is, of course, liable to occur. It may be diagnosed\r\nfrom diseased enlargements of the testicle, by its transparency, its\r\nfluctuation, and its smooth, uniform fulness and shape, besides its\r\nbeing of less weight than a diseased testis of the same size would be.\r\nIt may be distinguished from the common form of hydrocele of the\r\nisolated tunica vaginalis by the fact, that pressure made on the scrotum\r\nwill cause the fluid to pass freely into the general cavity of the\r\nperitonaeum. As the fluid distends the tunica vaginalis, 6 c, 6 d, in\r\nfront of the testis, this organ will of course lie towards the back of\r\nthe scrotum, and therefore, if it be found necessary to evacuate the\r\nfluid, the puncture may be made with most safety in front of the\r\nscrotum. If ascites should form in an adult in whom the tunica vaginalis\r\nstill communicates with the peritonaeal sac, the fluid which accumulates\r\nin the latter membrane will also distend the former, and all the\r\ncollected fluid may be evacuated by tapping the scrotum. When a\r\nhydrocele is found to be congenital, it must be at once obvious that to\r\ninject irritating fluids into the tunica vaginalis (the radical cure) is\r\ninadmissible. In an adult, free from all structural disease, and in whom\r\na congenital hydrocele is occasioned by the gravitation of the ordinary\r\nserous secretion of the peritonaeum, a cure may be effected by causing\r\nthe obliteration of the serous spermatic canal by the pressure of a\r\ntruss. When a congenital hydrocele happens in an infant in whom the\r\ntesticle, 5, Fig. 1, Plate 39, is arrested in the inguinal canal,\r\n[Footnote 2] if pressure be made on this passage with a view of causing\r\nits closure, the testicle will be prevented from descending.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The serous spermatic tube remains open in all quadrupeds;\r\nbut their natural prone position renders them secure against hydrocele\r\nor hernial protrusion. It is interesting to notice how in man, and the\r\nmost anthropo-morphous animals, where the erect position would subject\r\nthese to the frequent accident of hydrocele or hernia, nature causes the\r\nserous spermatic tube to close.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In many quadrupeds (the Rodentia and Monotremes) the testes\r\nremain within the abdomen. In the Elephant, the testes always occupy\r\ntheir original position beneath the kidneys, in the loins. Human adults\r\nare occasionally found to be \"testi-conde;\" the testes being situated\r\nbelow the kidneys, or at some part between this position and the\r\ninternal inguinal ring. Sometimes only one of the testes descends to the\r\nscrotum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 2.--The serous spermatic canal closes imperfectly, so as\r\nto become sacculated, and thus a hydrocele of the cord is formed.--After\r\nthe testicle, 7, has descended to the scrotum, the sides of the serous\r\ntube, or lining of the inguinal canal and cord, 6 b, 6 c, may become\r\nadherent at intervals; and the intervening sacs of serous membrane\r\ncontinuing to secrete their proper fluid, will occasion a hydrocele of\r\nthe cord. This form of hydrocele will differ according to the varieties\r\nin the manner of closure; and these may take place in the following\r\nmodes:--1st, if the serous tube close only at the internal ring, 6 a,\r\nwhile the lower part of it, 6 b, 6 c, remains pervious, and\r\ncommunicating with the tunica vaginalis, 6 d, a hydrocele will be formed\r\nof a corresponding shape; 2nd, if the tube close at the upper part of\r\nthe testicle, 6 c, thus isolating the tunica vaginalis, 6 d, while the\r\nupper part, 6 b, remains pervious, and the internal ring, 6 a, open, and\r\ncommunicating with the peritonaeal sac, a hydrocele of the cord will\r\nhappen distinct from the tunica vaginalis; or this latter may be, at the\r\nsame time, distended with fluid, if the disposition of the subject be\r\nfavourable to the formation of dropsy; 3rd, the serous tube may close at\r\nthe internal ring, form sacculi along the cord, and close again at the\r\ntop of the testicle, thus separating the tunica vaginalis from the\r\nabdomen, and thereby several isolated hydroceles may be formed. If in\r\nthis condition of the parts we puncture one of the sacs for the\r\nevacuation of its contents, the others, owing to their separation, will\r\nremain distended.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 3.--Hydrocele of the isolated tunica vaginalis.--When the\r\nserous spermatic tube, 6 b, 6 c, becomes obliterated, according to the\r\nnormal rule, after the descent of the testicle, 7, the tunica vaginalis,\r\n6 d, is then a distinct serous sac. If a hydrocele form in this sac, it\r\nmay be distinguished from the congenital variety by its remaining\r\nundiminished in bulk when the subject assumes the horizontal position,\r\nor when pressure is made on the tumour, for its contents cannot now be\r\nforced into the abdomen. The testicle, 7, holds the same position in\r\nthis as it does in the congenital hydrocele. [Footnote] The radical cure\r\nmay be performed here without endangering the peritonaeal sac.\r\nCongenital hydrocele is of a cylindrical shape; and this is mentioned as\r\ndistinguishing it from isolated hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, which\r\nis pyriform; but this mark will fail when the cord is at the same time\r\ndistended, as it may be, in the latter form of the complaint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: When a hydrocele is interposed between the eye and a strong\r\nlight, the testis appears as an opaque body at the back of the tunica\r\nvaginalis. But this position of the organ is, from several causes,\r\nliable to vary. The testis may have become morbidly adherent to the\r\nfront wall of the serous sac, in which case the hydrocele will distend\r\nthe sac laterally. Or the testis may be so transposed in the scrotum,\r\nthat, whilst the gland occupies its front part, the distended tunica\r\nvaginalis is turned behind. The tunica vaginalis, like the serous\r\nspermatic tube, may, in consequence of inflammatory fibrinous effusion,\r\nbecome sacculated-multilocular, in which case, if a hydrocele form, the\r\nposition of the testis will vary accordingly.--See Sir Astley Cooper's\r\nwork, (\"Anatomy and Diseases of the Testis;\") Morton's \"Surgical\r\nAnatomy;\" Mr. Curling's \"Treatise on Diseases of the Testis;\" and also\r\nhis article \"Testicle,\" in the Cyclopaedia of Anatomy and Physiology.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 4.--The serous spermatic tube remaining pervious, a\r\ncongenital hernia is formed.--When the testicle, 7, has descended to the\r\nscrotum, if the communication between the peritonaeum, 6 a, and the\r\ntunica vaginalis, 6 c, be not obliterated, a fold of the intestine, 13,\r\nwill follow the testicle, and occupy the cavity of the tunica vaginalis,\r\n6 d. In this form of hernia (hernia tunicae vaginalis, Cooper), the\r\nintestine is in front of, and in immediate contact with, the testicle.\r\nThe intestine may descend lower than the testicle, and envelope this\r\norgan so completely as to render its position very obscure to the touch.\r\nThis form of hernia is named congenital, since it occurs in the same\r\ncondition of the parts as is found in congenital hydrocele--viz., the\r\ninguinal ring remaining unclosed. It may occur at any period of life, so\r\nlong as the original congenital defect remains. It may be distinguished\r\nfrom hydrocele by its want of transparency and fluctuation. The impulse\r\nwhich is communicated to the hand applied to the scrotum of a person\r\naffected with scrotal hernia, when he is made to cough, is also felt in\r\nthe case of congenital hydrocele. But in hydrocele of the separate\r\ntunica vaginalis, such impulse is not perceived. Congenital hernia and\r\nhydrocele may co-exist; and, in this case, the diagnostic signs which\r\nare proper to each, when occurring separately, will be so mingled as to\r\nrender the precise nature of the case obscure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 5.--Infantile hernia.--When the serous spermatic tube\r\nbecomes merely closed, or obliterated at the inguinal ring, 6 b, the\r\nlower part of it, 6 c, is pervious, and communicating with the tunica\r\nvaginalis, 6 d. In consequence of the closure of the tube at the\r\ninguinal ring, if a hernia now occur, it cannot enter the tunica\r\nvaginalis, and come into actual contact with the testicle. The hernia,\r\n13, therefore, when about to force the peritonaeum, 6 a, near the closed\r\nring, 6 b, takes a distinct sac or investment from this membrane. This\r\nhernial sac, 6 e, will vary as to its position in regard to the tunica\r\nvaginalis, 6 d, according to the place whereat it dilates the\r\nperitonaeum at the ring. The peculiarity of this hernia, as\r\ndistinguished from the congenital form, is owing to the scrotum\r\ncontaining two sacs,--the tunica vaginalis and the proper sac of the\r\nhernia; whereas, in the congenital variety, the tunica vaginalis itself\r\nbecomes the hernial sac by a direct reception of the naked intestine. If\r\nin infantile hernia a hydrocele should form in the tunica vaginalis, the\r\nfluid will also distend the pervious serous spermatic tube, 6 c, as far\r\nup as the closed internal ring, 6 b, and will thus invest and obscure\r\nthe descending herniary sac, 13. This form of hernia is named infantile\r\n(Hey), owing to the congenital defect in that process, whereby the\r\nserous tube lining the cord is normally obliterated. Such a form of\r\nhernia may occur at the adult age for the first time, but it is still\r\nthe consequence of original default.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 40, Fig. 6.--Oblique inguinal hernia in the adult.--This variety\r\nof hernia occurs not in consequence of any congenital defect, except\r\ninasmuch as the natural weakness of the inguinal wall opposite the\r\ninternal ring may be attributed to this cause. The serous spermatic tube\r\nhas been normally obliterated for its whole length between the internal\r\nring and the tunica vaginalis; but the fibrous tube, or spermatic\r\nfascia, is open at the internal ring where it joins the transversalis\r\nfascia, and remains pervious as far down as the testicle. The intestine,\r\n13, forces and distends the upper end of the closed serous tube; and as\r\nthis is now wholly obliterated, the herniary sac, 6 c, derived anew from\r\nthe inguinal peritonaeum, enters the fibrous tube, or sheath of the\r\ncord, and descends it as far as the tunica vaginalis, 6 d, but does not\r\nenter this sac, as it is already closed. When we compare this hernia,\r\nFig. 6, Plate 40, with the infantile variety, Fig. 5, Plate 40, we find\r\nthat they agree in so far as the intestinal sac is distinct from the\r\ntunica vaginalis; whereas the difference between them is caused by the\r\nfact of the serous cord remaining in part pervious in the infantile\r\nhernia; and on comparing Fig. 6, Plate 40, with the congenital variety,\r\nFig. 4, Plate 40, we see that the intestine has acquired a new sac in\r\nthe former, whereas, in the latter, the intestine has entered the tunica\r\nvaginalis. The variable position of the testicle in Figs. 4, 5, & 6,\r\nPlate 40, is owing to the variety in the anatomical circumstances under\r\nwhich these herniae have happened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 40--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 41 & 42.\r\n\r\nDEMONSTRATIONS OF THE ORIGIN AND PROGRESS OF INGUINAL HERNIAE IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 1.--When the serous spermatic tube is obliterated for its\r\nwhole length between the internal ring, 1, and the top of the testicle,\r\n13, a hernia, in order to enter the inguinal canal, 1, 4, must either\r\nrupture the peritonaeum at the point 1, or dilate this membrane before\r\nit in the form of a sac. [Footnote] If the peritonaeum at the point 1 be\r\nruptured by the intestine, this latter will enter the fibrous spermatic\r\ntube, 2, 3, and will pass along this tube devoid of the serous sac. If,\r\non the other hand, the intestine dilates the serous membrane at the\r\npoint, 1, where it stretches across the internal ring, it will, on\r\nentering the fibrous tube, (infundibuliform fascia,) be found invested\r\nby a sac of the peritonaeum, which it dilates and pouches before itself.\r\nAs the epigastric artery, 9, bends in general along the internal border\r\nof the ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, the neck of the hernial sac which\r\nenters the ring at a point external to the artery must be external to\r\nit, and remain so despite all further changes in the form, position, and\r\ndimensions of the hernia. And as this hernia enters the ring at a point\r\nanterior to the spermatic vessels, its neck must be anterior to them.\r\nAgain, if the bowel be invested by a serous sac, formed of the\r\nperitonaeum at the point 1, the neck of such sac must intervene between\r\nthe protruding bowel and the epigastric and spermatic vessels. But if\r\nthe intestine enter the ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, by having\r\nruptured the peritonaeum at the point 1, then the naked intestine will\r\nlie in immediate contact with these vessels.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Mr. Lawrence (op. cit.) remarks, \"When we consider the\r\ntexture of the peritonaeum, and the mode of its connexion to the\r\nabdominal parietes, we cannot fancy the possibility of tearing the\r\nmembrane by any attitude or motion.\" Cloquet and Scarpa have also\r\nexpressed themselves to the effect, that the peritonaeum suffers a\r\ngradual distention before the protruding bowel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 1\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 2--When the serous spermatic tube, 11, remains pervious\r\nbetween the internal ring, 1, (where it communicates with the general\r\nperitonaeal membrane,) and the top of the testicle, (where it opens into\r\nthe tunica vaginalis,) the bowel enters this tube directly, without a\r\nrupture of the peritonaeum at the point 1. This tube, therefore, becomes\r\none of the investments of the bowel. It is the serous sac, not formed by\r\nthe protruding bowel, but one already open to receive the bowel. This is\r\nthe condition necessary to the formation of congenital hernia. This\r\nhernia must be one of the external oblique variety, because it enters\r\nthe open abdominal end of the infantile serous spermatic tube, which is\r\nalways external to the epigastric artery. Its position in regard to the\r\nspermatic vessels is the same as that noticed in Fig, 1, Plate 41. But,\r\nas the serous tube through which the congenital hernia descends, still\r\ncommunicates with the tunica vaginalis, so will this form of hernia\r\nenter this tunic, and thereby become different to all other herniae,\r\nforasmuch as it will lie in immediate contact with the testicle.\r\n[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A hernia may be truly congenital, and yet the intestine may\r\nnot enter the tunica vaginalis. Thus, if the serous spermatic tube close\r\nonly at the top of the testicle, the bowel which traverses the open\r\ninternal inguinal ring and pervious tube will not enter the tunica\r\nvaginalis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 3.--The infantile serous spermatic tube, 11, sometimes\r\nremains pervious in the neighbourhood of the internal ring, 1, and a\r\nnarrow tapering process of the tube (the canal of Nuck) descends within\r\nthe fibrous tube, 2, 3, and lies in front of the spermatic vessels and\r\nepigastric artery. Before this tube reaches the testicle, it degenerates\r\ninto a mere filament, and thus the tunica vaginalis has become separated\r\nfrom it as a distinct sac. When the bowel enters the open abdominal end\r\nof the serous tube, this latter becomes the hernial sac. It is not\r\npossible to distinguish by any special character a hernia of this\r\nnature, when already formed, from one which occurs in the condition of\r\nparts proper to Fig. 1, Plate 41, or that which is described in the note\r\nto Fig. 2, Plate 41; for when the intestine dilates the tube, 11, into\r\nthe form of a sac, this latter assumes the exact shape of the sac, as\r\nnoticed in Fig. 1, Plate 41. The hernia in question cannot enter the\r\ntunica vaginalis. Its position in regard to the epigastric and spermatic\r\nvessels is the same as that mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 3\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 4.--If the serous spermatic tube, 11, be obliterated or\r\nclosed at the internal ring, 1, thus cutting off communication with the\r\ngeneral peritonaeal membrane; and if, at the same time, it remain\r\npervious from this point above to the tunica vaginalis below, then the\r\nherniary bowel, when about to protrude at the point 1, must force and\r\ndilate the peritonaeum, in order to form its sac anew, as stated of Fig.\r\n1, Plate 41. Such a hernia does not enter either the serous tube or the\r\ntunica vaginalis; but progresses from the point 1, in a distinct sac. In\r\nthis case, there will be found two sacs--one enclosing the bowel; and\r\nanother, consisting of the serous spermatic tube, still continuous with\r\nthe tunica vaginalis. This original state of the parts may, however,\r\nsuffer modification in two modes: 1st, if the bowel rupture the\r\nperitonaeum at the point 1, it will enter the serous tube 11, and\r\ndescend through this into the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, as in the\r\ncongenital variety. 2nd, if the bowel rupture the peritonaeum near the\r\npoint 1, and does not enter the serous tube 11, nor the tunica\r\nvaginalis, then the bowel will be found devoid of a proper serous sac,\r\nwhile the serous tube and tunica vaginalis still exist in communication.\r\nIn either case, the hernia will hold the same relative position in\r\nregard to the epigastric artery and spermatic vessels, as stated of Fig.\r\n1, Plate 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 4\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 5.--Sudden rupture of the peritonaeum at the closed\r\ninternal serous ring, 1, though certainly not impossible, may yet be\r\nstated as the exception to the rule in the formation of an external\r\ninguinal hernia. The aphorism, \"natura non facit saltus,\" is here\r\napplicable. When the peritonaeum suffers dilatation at the internal\r\nring, 1, it advances gradatim and pari passu with the progress of the\r\nprotruding bowel, and assumes the form, character, position, and\r\ndimensions of the inverted curved phases, marked 11, 11, till, from\r\nhaving at first been a very shallow pouch, lying external to the\r\nepigastric artery, 9, it advances through the inguinal canal to the\r\nexternal ring, 4, and ultimately traverses this aperture, taking the\r\ncourse of the fibrous tube, 3, down to the testicle in the scrotum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 5\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 6.--When the bowel dilates the peritonaeum opposite the\r\ninternal ring, and carries a production of this membrane before it as\r\nits sac, then the hernia will occupy the inguinal canal, and become\r\ninvested by all those structures which form the canal. These structures\r\nare severally infundibuliform processes, so fashioned by the original\r\ndescent of the testicle; and, therefore, as the bowel follows the track\r\nof the testicle, it becomes, of course, invested by the selfsame parts\r\nin the selfsame manner. Thus, as the infundibuliform fascia, 2, 3,\r\ncontains the hernia and spermatic vessels, so does the cremaster muscle,\r\nextending from the lower margins of the internal oblique and\r\ntransversalis, invest them also in an infundibuliform manner. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Much difference of opinion prevails as to the true relation\r\nwhich the cord (and consequently the oblique hernia) bears to the lower\r\nmargins of the oblique and transverse muscles, and their cremasteric\r\nprolongation. Mr. Guthrie (Inguinal and Femoral Hernia) has shown that\r\nthe fibres of the transversalis, as well as those of the internal\r\noblique, are penetrated by the cord. Albinus, Haller, Cloquet, Camper,\r\nand Scarpa, record opinions from which it may be gathered that this\r\ndisposition of the parts is (with some exceptions) general. Sir Astley\r\nCooper describes the lower edge of the transversalis as curved all round\r\nthe internal ring and cord. From my own observations, coupled with\r\nthese, I am inclined to the belief that, instead of viewing these facts\r\nas isolated and meaningless particulars, we should now fuse them into\r\nthe one idea expressed by the philosophic Carus, and adopted by Cloquet,\r\nthat the cremaster is a production of the abdominal muscles, formed\r\nmechanically by the testicle, which in its descent dilates, penetrates,\r\nand elongates their fibres.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 6\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41. Fig. 7.--When an external inguinal hernia, 11, dilates and\r\nprotrudes the peritonaeum from the closed internal ring, 1, and descends\r\nthe inguinal canal and fibrous tube, 3, 3, it imitates, in most\r\nrespects, the original descent of the testicle. The difference between\r\nboth descents attaches alone to the mode in which they become covered by\r\nthe serous membrane; for the testicle passes through the internal ring\r\nbehind the inguinal peritonaeum, at the same time that it takes a\r\nduplicature of this membrane; whereas the bowel encounters this part of\r\nthe peritonaeum from within, and in this mode becomes invested by it on\r\nall sides. This figure also represents the form and relative position of\r\na hernia, as occurring in Figs. 1 and 3, 5, and 6, Plate 41.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 7\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 41, Fig. 8.--When the serous spermatic tube only closes at the\r\ninternal ring, as seen at 1, Fig. 4, Plate 41, if a hernia afterwards\r\npouch the peritonaeum at this part, and enter the inguinal canal, we\r\nshall then have the form of hernia, Fig. 8, Plate 41, termed infantile.\r\nTwo serous sacs will be here found, one within the cord, 13, and\r\ncommunicating with the tunica vaginalis, the other, 11, containing the\r\nbowel, and being received by inversion into the upper extremity of the\r\nfirst. Thus the infantile serous canal, 13, receives the hernial sac,\r\n11. The inguinal canal and cord may become multicapsular, as in Fig. 8,\r\nfrom various causes, each capsule being a distinct serous membrane.\r\nFirst, independent of hernial formation, the original serous tube may\r\nbecome interruptedly obliterated, as in Plate 40, Fig. 2. Secondly,\r\nthese sacs may persist to adult age, and have a hernial sac added to\r\ntheir number, whatever this may be. Thirdly, the original serous tube,\r\n13, Fig. 8, may persist, and after having received the hernial sac, 11,\r\nthe bowel may have been reduced, leaving its sac behind it in the\r\ninguinal canal; the neck of this sac may have been obliterated by the\r\npressure of a truss, a second hernia may protrude at the point 1, and\r\nthis may be received into the first hernial sac in the same manner as\r\nthe first was received into the original serous infantile tube. The\r\npossibility of these occurrences is self-evident, even if they were\r\nnever as yet experienced. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: According to Mr. Lawrence and M. Cloquet, most of the serous\r\ncysts found around hernial tumours are ancient sacs obliterated at the\r\nneck, and adhering to the new swelling (opera cit.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 41--Figure 8\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 42, Fig. 1.--The epigastric artery, 9, being covered by the fascia\r\ntransversalis, can lend no support to the internal ring, 2, 2, nor to\r\nthe tube prolonged from it. The herniary bowel may, therefore, dilate\r\nthe peritonaeum immediately on the inner side of the artery, and enter\r\nthe inguinal canal. In this way the hernia, 11, although situated\r\ninternal to the epigastric artery, assumes an oblique course through the\r\ncanal, and thus closely simulates the external variety of inguinal\r\nhernia, Fig. 7, Plate 41. If the hernia enter the canal, as represented\r\nin Fig. 1, Plate 42, it becomes invested by the same structures, and\r\nassumes the same position in respect to the spermatic vessels, as the\r\nexternal hernia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 1\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 42, Fig. 2.--The hernial sac, 11, which entered the ring of the\r\nfibrous tube, 2, 2, at a point immediately internal to the epigastric\r\nartery, 9, may, from having been at first oblique, as in Fig. 1, Plate\r\n42, assume a direct position. In this case, the ring of the fibrous\r\ntube, 2, 2, will be much widened; but the artery and spermatic vessels\r\nwill remain in their normal position, being in no wise affected by the\r\ngravitating hernia. If the conjoined tendon, 6, be so weak as not to\r\nresist the gravitating force of the hernia, the tendon will become bent\r\nupon itself. If the umbilical cord, 10, be side by side with the\r\nepigastric artery at the time that the hernia enters the mouth of the\r\nfibrous tube, then, of course, the cord will be found external. If the\r\ncord lie towards the pubes, apart from the vessel, the hernia may enter\r\nthe fibrous tube between the cord, 10, and artery, 9. [Footnote:] It is\r\nimpossible for any internal hernia to assume the congenital form,\r\nbecause the neck of the original serous spermatic tube, 11, Fig. 2,\r\nPlate 41, being external to the epigastric artery, 9, cannot be entered\r\nby the hernia, which originates internally to this vessel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: M. Cloquet states that the umbilical cord is always found on\r\nthe inner side of the external hernia. Its position varies in respect to\r\nthe internal hernia, (op. cit. prop. 52.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 42, Fig. 3.--Every internal hernia, which does not rupture the\r\nperitonaeum, carries forward a sac produced anew from this membrane,\r\nwhether the hernia enter the inguinal canal or not. But this is not the\r\ncase with respect to the fibrous membrane which forms the fascia\r\npropria. If the hernia enter the inguinal wall immediately on the inner\r\nside of the epigastric artery, Fig. 1, Plate 42, it passes direct into\r\nthe ring of the fibrous tube, 2, 2, already prepared to receive it. But\r\nwhen the hernia, 11, Fig. 3, Plate 42, cleaves the conjoined tendon, 6,\r\n6, then the artery, 9, and the tube, 2, 2, remain in their usual\r\nposition, while the bowel carries forward a new investment from the\r\ntransversalis fascia, 5, 5. That part of the conjoined tendon which\r\nstands external to the hernia keeps the tube, 2, 2, in its proper place,\r\nand separates it from the fold of the fascia which invests the hernial\r\nsac. This is the only form in which an internal hernia can be said to be\r\nabsolutely distinct from the inguinal canal and spermatic vessels. This\r\nhernia, when passing the external ring, 4, has the spermatic cord on its\r\nouter side.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 3\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 42, Fig. 4.--The external hernia, from having been originally\r\noblique, may assume the position of a hernia originally internal and\r\ndirect. The change of place exhibited by this form of hernia does not\r\nimply a change either in its original investments or in its position\r\nwith respect to the epigastric artery and spermatic vessels. The change\r\nis merely caused by the weight and gravitation of the hernial mass,\r\nwhich bends the epigastric artery, 9*, from its first position on the\r\ninner margin of the internal ring, 1, till it assumes the place 9. In\r\nconsequence of this, the internal ring of the fascia transversalis, 2,\r\n2, is considerably widened, as it is also in Fig. 2, Plate 42. It is the\r\ninner margin of the fibrous ring which has suffered the pressure; and\r\nthus the hernia now projects directly from behind forwards, through, 4,\r\nthe external ring. The conjoined tendon, 6, when weak, becomes bent upon\r\nitself. The change of place performed by the gravitating hernia may\r\ndisturb the order and relative position of the spermatic vessels; but\r\nthese, as well as the hernia, still occupy the inguinal canal, and are\r\ninvested by the spermatic fascia, 3, 3. When an internal hernia, Fig. 1,\r\nPlate 42, enters the inguinal canal, it also may descend the cord as far\r\nas the testicle, and assume in respect to this gland the same position\r\nas the external hernia. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As the external hernia, Fig. 4, Plate 42, may displace the\r\nepigastric artery inwards, so may the internal hernia, Fig. 1, Plate 42,\r\ndisplace the artery outwards. Mr. Lawrence, Sir Astley Cooper, Scarpa,\r\nHesselbach, and Langenbeck, state, however, that the internal hernia\r\ndoes not disturb the artery from its usual position three-fourths of an\r\ninch from the external ring.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 4\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 42, Figs. 5, 6, 7.--The form and position of the inguinal canal\r\nvaries according to the sex and age of the individual. In early life,\r\nFig. 6, the internal ring is situated nearly opposite to the external\r\nring, 4. As the pelvis widens gradually in the advance to adult age,\r\nFig. 5, the canal becomes oblique as to position. This obliquity is\r\ncaused by a change of place, performed rather by the internal than the\r\nexternal ring. [Footnote] The greater width of the female pelvis than of\r\nthe male, renders the canal more oblique in the former; and this,\r\ncombined with the circumstance that the female inguinal canal, Fig. 7,\r\nmerely transmits the round ligament, 14, accounts anatomically for the\r\nfact, that this sex is less liable to the occurrence of rupture in this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: M. Velpeau (Nouveaux Elemens de med. Operat.) states the\r\nlength of the inguinal canal in a well-formed adult, measured from the\r\ninternal to the external ring, to be 1-1/2 or 2 inches, and 3 inches\r\nincluding the rings; but that in some individuals the rings are placed\r\nnearly opposite; whilst in young subjects the two rings nearly always\r\ncorrespond. When, in company with these facts, we recollect how much the\r\nparts are liable to be disturbed in ruptures, it must be evident that\r\ntheir relative position cannot be exactly ascertained by measurement,\r\nfrom any given point whatever. The judgment alone must fix the general\r\naverage.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 5\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen and scrotum, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 6\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 42--Figure 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 43 & 44.\r\n\r\nTHE DISSECTION OF FEMORAL HERNIA, AND THE SEAT OF STRICTURE.\r\n\r\nWhilst all forms of inguinal herniae escape from the abdomen at places\r\nsituated immediately above Poupart's ligament, the femoral hernia, G,\r\nFig. 1, Plate 43, is found to pass from the abdomen immediately below\r\nthis structure, A I, and between it and the horizontal branch of the\r\npubic bone. The inguinal canal and external abdominal ring are parts\r\nconcerned in the passage of inguinal herniae, whether oblique or direct,\r\nexternal or internal; whilst the femoral canal and saphenous opening are\r\nthe parts through which the femoral hernia passes. Both these orders of\r\nparts, and of the herniae connected with them respectively, are,\r\nhowever, in reality situated so closely to each other in the\r\ninguino-femoral region, that, in order to understand either, we should,\r\nexamine both at the same time comparatively.\r\n\r\nThe structure which is named Poupart's ligament in connexion with\r\ninguinal herniae, is named the femoral or crural arch (Gimbernat) in\r\nrelation to femoral hernia. The simple line, therefore, described by\r\nthis ligament explains the narrow interval which separates both\r\nvarieties of the complaint. So small is the line of separation described\r\nbetween these herniae by the ligament, that this (so to express the\r\nidea) stands in the character of an arch, which, at the same time,\r\nsupports an aqueduct (the inguinal canal) and spans a road (the femoral\r\nsheath.) The femoral arch, A I, Fig. 1, Plate 43, extends between the\r\nanterior superior iliac spinous process and the pubic spine. It connects\r\nthe aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, D d, Fig. 2, Plate 44,\r\nwith F, the fascia lata. Immediately above and below its pubic extremity\r\nappear the external ring and the saphenous opening. On cutting through\r\nthe falciform process, F, Fig. 1, Plate 44, we find Gimbernat's\r\nligament, R, a structure well known in connexion with femoral hernia.\r\nGimbernat's ligament consists of tendinous fibres which connect the\r\ninner end of the femoral arch with the pectineal ridge of the os pubis.\r\nThe shape of the ligament is acutely triangular, corresponding to the\r\nform of the space which it occupies. Its apex is internal, and close to\r\nthe pubic spine; its base is external, sharp and concave, and in\r\napposition with the sheath of the femoral vessels. It measures an inch,\r\nmore or less, in width, and it is broader in the male than in the\r\nfemale--a fact which is said to account for the greater frequency of\r\nfemoral hernia in the latter sex than in the former, (Monro.) Its\r\nstrength and density also vary in different individuals. It is covered\r\nanteriorly by, P, Fig. 1, Plate 44, the upper cornu of the falciform\r\nprocess; and behind, it is in connexion with, k, the conjoined tendon.\r\nThis tendon is inserted with the ligament into the pectineal ridge. The\r\nfalciform process also blends with the ligament; and thus it is that the\r\nfemoral hernia, when constricted by either of these three structures,\r\nmay well be supposed to suffer pressure from the three together.\r\n\r\nA second or deep femoral arch is occasionally met with. This structure\r\nconsists of tendinous fibres, lying deeper than, but parallel with,\r\nthose of the superficial arch. The deep arch spans the femoral sheath\r\nmore closely than the superficial arch, and occupies the interval left\r\nbetween the latter and the sheath of the vessels. When the deep arch\r\nexists, its inner end blends with the conjoined tendon and Gimbernat's\r\nligament, and with these may also constrict the femoral hernia.\r\n\r\nThe sheath, e f, of the femoral vessels, E F, Fig. 1, Plate 43, passes\r\nfrom beneath the middle of the femoral arch. In this situation, the\r\niliac part of the fascia lata, F G, Fig. 2, Plate 44, covers the sheath.\r\nIts inner side is bounded by Gimbernat's ligament, R, Fig. 1, Plate 44,\r\nand F, the falciform edge of the saphenous opening. On its outer side\r\nare situated the anterior crural nerve, and the femoral parts of the\r\npsoas and iliacus muscles. Of the three compartments into which the\r\nsheath is divided by two septa in its interior, the external one, E,\r\nFig. 1, Plate 43, is occupied by the femoral artery; the middle one, F,\r\nby the femoral vein; whilst the inner one, G, gives passage to the\r\nfemoral lymphatic vessels; and occasionally, also, a lymphatic body is\r\nfound in it. The inner compartment, G, is the femoral canal, and through\r\nit the femoral hernia descends from the abdomen to the upper and\r\nforepart of the thigh. As the canal is the innermost of the three spaces\r\ninclosed by the sheath, it is that which lies in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the saphenous opening, Gimbernat's ligament, and the\r\nconjoined tendon, and between these structures and the femoral vein.\r\n\r\nThe sheath of the femoral vessels, like that of the spermatic cord, is\r\ninfundibuliform. Both are broader at their abdominal ends than\r\nelsewhere. The femoral sheath being broader above than below, whilst the\r\nvessels are of a uniform diameter, presents, as it were, a surplus space\r\nto receive a hernia into its upper end. This space is the femoral or\r\ncrural canal. Its abdominal entrance is the femoral or crural ring.\r\n\r\nThe femoral ring, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, is, in the natural state of the\r\nparts, closed over by the peritonaeum, in the same manner as this\r\nmembrane shuts the internal inguinal ring. There is, however,\r\ncorresponding to each ring, a depression in the peritonaeal covering;\r\nand here it is that the bowel first forces the membrane and forms of\r\nthis part its sac.\r\n\r\nOn removing the peritonaeum from the inguinal wall on the inner side of\r\nthe iliac vessels, K L, we find the horizontal branch of the os pubis,\r\nand the parts connected with it above and below, to be still covered by\r\nwhat is called the subserous tissue. The femoral ring is not as yet\r\ndiscernible on the inner side of the iliac vein, K; for the subserous\r\ntissue being stretched across this aperture masks it. The portion of the\r\ntissue which closes the ring is named the crural septum, (Cloquet.) When\r\nwe remove this part, we open the femoral ring leading to the\r\ncorresponding canal. The ring is the point of union between the fibrous\r\nmembrane of the canal and the general fibrous membrane which lines the\r\nabdominal walls external to the peritonaeum. This account of the\r\ncontinuity between the canal and abdominal fibrous membrane equally\r\napplies to the connexion existing between the general sheath of the\r\nvessels and the abdominal membrane. The difference exists in the fact,\r\nthat the two outer compartments of the sheath are occupied by the\r\nvessels, whilst the inner one is vacant. The neck or inlet of the\r\nhernial sac, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, exactly represents the natural form of\r\nthe crural ring, as formed in the fibrous membrane external to, or (as\r\nseen in this view) beneath the peritonaeum.\r\n\r\nThe femoral ring, H, is girt round on all sides by a dense fibrous\r\ncircle, the upper arc being formed by the two femoral arches; the outer\r\narc is represented by the septum of the femoral sheath, which separates\r\nthe femoral vein from the canal; the inner arc is formed by the united\r\ndense fibrous bands of the conjoined tendon and Gimbernat's ligament;\r\nand the inferior arc is formed by the pelvic fascia where this passes\r\nover the pubic bone to unite with the under part of the femoral canal\r\nand sheath. The ring thus bound by dense resisting fibrous structure, is\r\nrendered sharp on its pubic and upper sides by the salient edges of the\r\nconjoined tendon and Gimbernat's ligament, &c. From the femoral ring the\r\ncanal extends down the thigh for an inch and a-half or two inches in a\r\ntapering form, supported by the pectineus muscle, and covered by the\r\niliac part of the fascia lata. It lies side by side with the saphenous\r\nopening, but does not communicate with this place. On a level with the\r\nlower cornu of the saphenous opening, the walls of the canal become\r\nclosely applied to the femoral vessels, and here it may be said to\r\nterminate.\r\n\r\nThe bloodvessels which pass in the neighbourhood of the femoral canal\r\nare, 1st. the femoral vein, F, Fig. 1, Plate 43, which enclosed in its\r\nproper sheath lies parallel with and close to the outer side of the\r\npassage. 2nd, Within the inguinal canal above are the spermatic vessels,\r\nresting on the upper surface of the femoral arch, which alone separates\r\nthem from the upper part or entrance of the femoral canal. 3rd, The\r\nepigastric artery, F, Fig. 2, Plate 43, which passes close to the outer\r\nand upper border of, H, the femoral ring. This vessel occasionally gives\r\noff the obturator artery, which, when thus derived, will be found to\r\npass towards the obturator foramen, in close connexion with the ring;\r\nthat is, either descending by its outer border, G*, between this point\r\nand the iliac vein, K; or arching the ring, G, so as to pass down close\r\nto its inner or pubic border. In some instances, the vessel crosses the\r\nring; a vein generally accompanies the artery. These peculiarities in\r\nthe origin and course of the obturator artery, especially that of\r\npassing on the pubic side of the ring, behind Gimbernat's ligament and\r\nthe conjoined tendon, E H, are fortunately very rare.\r\n\r\nAs the course to be taken by the bowel, when a femoral hernia is being\r\nformed, is through the crural ring and canal, the structures which have\r\njust now been enumerated as bounding this passage, will, of course, hold\r\nthe like relation to the hernia. The manner in which a femoral hernia is\r\nformed, and the way in which it becomes invested in its descent, may be\r\nbriefly stated thus: The bowel first dilates the peritonaeum opposite\r\nthe femoral ring, H, Fig. 2, Plate 43, and pushes this membrane before\r\nit into the canal. This covering is the hernial sac. The crural septum\r\nhas, at the same time, entered the canal as a second investment of the\r\nbowel. The hernia is now enclosed by the sheath, G, Fig. 1, Plate 43, of\r\nthe canal itself. [Footnote 1] Its further progress through the\r\nsaphenous opening, B F, Fig. 1, Plate 44, must be made either by\r\nrupturing the weak inner wall of the canal, or by dilating this part; in\r\none or other of these modes, the herniary sac emerges from the canal\r\nthrough the saphenous opening. In general, it dilates the side of the\r\ncanal, and this becomes the fascia propria, B G. If it have ruptured the\r\ncanal, the hernial sac appears devoid of this covering. In either case,\r\nthe hernia, increasing in size, turns up over the margin of F, the\r\nfalciform process, [Footnote 2] and ultimately rests upon the iliac\r\nfascia lata, below the pubic third of Poupart's ligament. Sometimes the\r\nhernia rests upon this ligament, and simulates, to all outward\r\nappearance, an oblique inguinal hernia. In this course, the femoral\r\nhernia will have its three parts--neck, body, and fundus--forming nearly\r\nright angles with each other: its neck [Footnote 3] descends the crural\r\ncanal, its body is directed to the pubis through the saphenous opening,\r\nand its fundus is turned upwards to the femoral arch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The sheath of the canal, together with the crural septum,\r\nconstitutes the \"fascia propria\" of the hernia (Sir Astley Cooper). Mr.\r\nLawrence denies the existence of the crural septum.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2:  The \"upper cornu of the saphenous opening,\" the \"falciform\r\nprocess\" (Burns), and the \"femoral ligament\" (Hey), are names applied to\r\nthe same part. With what difficulty and perplexity does this\r\nimpenetrable fog of surgical nomenclature beset the progress of the\r\nlearner!]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The neck of the sac at the femoral ring lies very deep, in\r\nthe undissected state of the parts (Lawrence).]\r\n\r\nThe crural hernia is much more liable to suffer constriction than the\r\ninguinal hernia. The peculiar sinuous course which the former takes from\r\nits point of origin, at the crural ring, to its place on Poupart's\r\nligament, and the unyielding fibrous structures which form the canal\r\nthrough which it passes, fully account for the more frequent occurrence\r\nof this casualty. The neck of the sac may, indeed, be supposed always to\r\nsuffer more or less constriction at the crural ring. The part which\r\noccupies the canal is also very much compressed; and again, where the\r\nhernia turns over the falciform process, this structure likewise must\r\ncause considerable compression on the bowel in the sac. [Footnote] This\r\nhernia suffers stricture of the passive kind always; for the dense\r\nfibrous bands in its neighbourhood compress it rather by withstanding\r\nthe force of the herniary mass than by reacting upon it. There are no\r\nmuscular fibres crossing the course of this hernia; neither are the\r\nparts which constrict it likely to change their original position,\r\nhowever long it may exist. In the inguinal hernia, the weight of the\r\nmass may in process of time widen the canal by gravitating; but the\r\ncrural hernia, resting on the pubic bone, cannot be supposed to dilate\r\nthe crural ring, however greatly the protrusion may increase in size and\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Sir A. Cooper (Crural Hernia) is of opinion that the\r\nstricture is generally in the neck of the sheath. Mr. Lawrence remarks,\r\n\"My own observations of the subject have led me to refer the cause of\r\nstricture to the thin posterior border (Gimbernat's ligament) of the\r\ncrural arch, at the part where it is connected to the falciform\r\nprocess.\" (Op. cit.) This statement agrees also with the experience of\r\nHey, (Practical Obs.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 43 & 44.\r\n\r\nPLATE 43.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.\r\n\r\nA.

The inguinal hernia,\r\n3, arising above, 5, the crural arch, descends the canal, 3, 3, under\r\ncover of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle, obliquely\r\ndownwards and inwards till it gains the external abdominal ring formed\r\nin the aponeurosis, and thence descends to the scrotum. The femoral\r\nhernia, commencing on a level with, 5, the femoral arch, descends the\r\nfemoral canal, under cover of the fascia lata, and appears on the upper\r\nand forepart of the thigh at the saphenous opening, 6, 7, formed in the\r\nfascia lata; and thence, instead of descending to the scrotum, like the\r\ninguinal hernia, turns, on the contrary, up over the falciform process,\r\n6, till its fundus rests near, 5, the very place beneath which it\r\noriginated. Such are the peculiarities in the courses of these two\r\nhernial; and they are readily accounted for by the anatomical relations\r\nof the parts concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 1\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 45, Fig. 2.--There exists a very evident analogy between the\r\ncanals through which both herniae pass. The infundibuliform fascia, 3,\r\n3, of the spermatic vessels is like the infundibuliform sheath, 9, 9, of\r\nthe femoral vessels. Both sheaths are productions of the general fibrous\r\nmembrane of the abdomen. They originate from nearly the same locality.\r\nThe ring of the femoral canal, 12, is situated immediately below, but to\r\nthe inner side of the internal inguinal ring, 3. The epigastric artery,\r\n1, marks the width of the interval which separates the two rings.\r\nPoupart's ligament, 5, being the line of union between the oblique\r\naponeurosis of the abdominal muscle and the fascia lata, merely\r\noverarches the femoral sheath, and does not separate it absolutely from\r\nthe spermatic sheath.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 45, Fig. 3.--The peritonaeum, 2, 3, closes the femoral canal, 12,\r\nat the femoral ring, in the same way as this membrane closes the\r\ninguinal canal at the internal inguinal ring, 3, Fig. 2, Plate 45. The\r\nepigastric artery always holds an intermediate position between both\r\nrings. The spermatic vessels in the inguinal tube, 3, 3, Fig. 2, Plate\r\n45, are represented by the round ligament in the female inguinal canal,\r\nFig. 3, Plate 45. When the bowel is about to protrude at either of the\r\nrings, it first dilates the peritonaeum, which covers these openings.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 3\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 45, Fig. 4.--The place of election for the formation of any hernia\r\nis that which is structurally the weakest. As the space which the\r\nfemoral arch spans external to the vessels is fully occupied by the\r\npsoas and iliacus muscles, and, moreover, as the abdominal fibrous\r\nmembrane and its prolongation, the femoral sheath, closely embrace the\r\nvessels on their outer anterior and posterior sides, whilst on their\r\ninner side the membrane and sheath are removed at a considerable\r\ninterval from the vessels, it is through this interval (the canal) that\r\nthe hernia may more readily pass. The peritonaeum, 2, and crural septum,\r\n13, form at this place the only barrier against the protrusion of the\r\nbowel into the canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 4\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 45, Fig. 5.--The hernia cannot freely enter the compartment, 10,\r\noccupied by the artery, neither can it enter the place 11, occupied as\r\nit is by the vein. It cannot readily pass through the inguinal wall at a\r\npoint internal to, 9, the crural sheath, for here it is opposed by, 4,\r\nthe conjoined tendon, and by, 8, Gimbernat's ligament. Neither will the\r\nhernia force a way at a point external to the femoral vessels in\r\npreference to that of the crural canal, which is already prepared to\r\nadmit it. [Footnote] The bowel, therefore, enters the femoral canal, 9,\r\nand herein it lies covered by its peritonaeal sac, derived from that\r\npart of the membrane which once masked the crural ring. The septum\r\ncrurale itself, having been dilated before the sac, of course invests it\r\nalso. The femoral canal forms now the third covering of the bowel. If in\r\nthis stage of the hernia it should suffer constriction, Gimbernat's\r\nligament, 8, is the cause of it. An incipient femoral hernia of the size\r\nof 2, 12, cannot, in the undissected state of the parts, be detected by\r\nmanual operation; for, being bound down by the dense fibrous structures\r\nwhich gird the canal, it forms no apparent tumour in the groin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The mode in which the femoral sheath, continued from the\r\nabdominal membrane, becomes simply applied to the sides of the vessels,\r\nrenders it of course not impossible for a hernia to protrude into the\r\nsheath at any point of its abdominal entrance. Mr. Stanley and M.\r\nCloquet have observed a femoral hernia external to the vessels.\r\nHesselbach has also met with this variety. A hernia of this nature has\r\ncome under my own observation. Cloquet has seen the hernia descend the\r\nsheath once in front of the vessels, and once behind them. These\r\nvarieties, however, must be very rare. The external form has never been\r\nmet with by Hey, Cooper, or Scarpa; whilst no less than six instances of\r\nit have come under the notice of Mr. Macilwain, (on Hernia, p. 293.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 5\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 45, Fig. 6.--The hernia, 2, 12, increasing gradually in size,\r\nbecomes tightly impacted in the crural canal, and being unable to dilate\r\nthis tube uniformly to a size corresponding with its own volume, it at\r\nlength bends towards the saphenous opening, 6, 7, this being the more\r\neasy point of egress. Still, the neck of the sac, 2, remains constricted\r\nat the ring, whilst the part which occupies the canal is also very much\r\nnarrowed. The fundus of the sac, 9*, 12, alone expands, as being free of\r\nthe canal; and covering this part of the hernia may be seen the fascia\r\npropria, 9*. This fascia is a production of the inner wall of the canal;\r\nand if we trace its sides, we shall find its lower part to be continuous\r\nwith the femoral sheath, whilst its upper part is still continuous with\r\nthe fascia transversalis. When the hernia ruptures the saphenous side of\r\nthe canal, the fascia propria is, of course, absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 45.--FIGURE 6\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 46, Fig. 1.--The anatomical circumstances which serve for the\r\ndiagnosis of a femoral from an inguinal hernia may be best explained by\r\nviewing in contrast the respective positions assumed by both complaints.\r\nThe direct hernia, 13, traverses the inguinal wall from behind, at a\r\nsituation corresponding with the external ring; and from this latter\r\npoint it descends the scrotum. An oblique external inguinal hernia\r\nenters the internal ring, 3, which exists further apart from the general\r\nmedian line, and, in order to gain the external ring, has to take an\r\noblique course from without inwards through the inguinal canal. A\r\nfemoral hernia enters the crural ring, 2, immediately below, but on the\r\ninner side of, the internal inguinal ring, and descends the femoral\r\ncanal, 12, vertically to where it emerges through, 6, 7, the saphenous\r\nopening. The direct inguinal hernia, 13, owing to its form and position,\r\ncan scarcely ever be mistaken for a femoral hernia. But in consequence\r\nof the close relationship between the internal inguinal ring, 3, and the\r\nfemoral ring, 2, through which their respective herniae pass, some\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing between these complaints may occur. An\r\nincipient femoral hernia, occupying the crural canal between the points,\r\n2, 12, presents no apparent tumour in the undissected state of the\r\nparts; and a bubonocele, or incipient inguinal hernia, occupying the\r\ninguinal canal, 3, 3, where it is braced down by the external oblique\r\naponeurosis, will thereby be also obscured in some degree. But, in most\r\ninstances, the bubonocele distends the inguinal canal somewhat; and the\r\nimpulse which on coughing is felt at a place above the femoral arch,\r\nwill serve to indicate, by negative evidence, that it is not a femoral\r\nhernia.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 46.--FIGURE 1\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 46, Fig. 2.--When the inguinal and femoral herniae are fully\r\nproduced, they best explain their distinctive nature. The inguinal\r\nhernia, 13, descends the scrotum, whilst the femoral hernia, 9*, turns\r\nover the falciform process, 6, and rests upon the fascia lata and\r\nfemoral arch. Though in this position the fundus of a femoral hernia\r\nlies in the neighbourhood of the inguinal canal, 3, yet the swelling can\r\nscarcely be mistaken for an inguinal rupture, since, in addition to its\r\nbeing superficial to the aponeurosis which covers the inguinal canal,\r\nand also to the femoral arch, it may be withdrawn readily from this\r\nplace, and its body, 12, traced to where it sinks into the saphenous\r\nopening, 6, 7, on the upper part of the thigh. An inguinal hernia\r\nmanifests its proper character more and more plainly as it advances from\r\nits point of origin to its termination in the scrotum. A femoral hernia,\r\non the contrary, masks its proper nature, as well at its point of origin\r\nas at its termination. But when a femoral hernia stands midway between\r\nthese two, points--viz. in the saphenous opening, 6, 7, it best exhibits\r\nits special character; for here it exists below the femoral arch, and\r\nconsiderably apart from the external abdominal ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPLATE 46.--FIGURE 2\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE 46, Fig. 3.--The neck of the sac of a femoral hernia, 2, lies\r\nalways close to, 3, the epigastric artery. When the obturator artery is\r\nderived from the epigastric, if the former pass internal to the neck\r\nbehind, 8, Gimbernat's ligament, it can scarcely escape being wounded\r\nwhen this structure is being severed by the operator's knife. If, on the\r\nother hand, the obturator artery descend external to the neck of the\r\nsac, the vessel will be comparatively remote from danger while the\r\nligament is being divided. In addition to the fact that the cause of\r\nstricture is always on the pubic side, 8, of the neck of the sac, 12,\r\nthereby requiring the incision to correspond with this situation only,\r\nother circumstances, such as the constant presence of the femoral vein,\r\n11, and the epigastric artery, 1, determine the avoidance of ever\r\nincising the canal on its outer or upper side. And if the obturator\r\nartery, [Footnote] by rare occurrence, happen to loop round the inner\r\nside of the neck of the sac, supposing this to be the seat of stricture,\r\nwhat amount of anatomical knowledge, at the call of the most dexterous\r\noperator, can render the vessel safe from danger?\r\n\r\n[Footnote: M. Velpeau (Medecine Operatoire), in reference to the\r\nrelative frequency of cases in which the obturator artery is derived\r\nfrom the epigastric, remarks, \"L'examen que j'ai pu en faire sur\r\nplusieurs milliers de cadavres, ne me permet pas de dire qu'elle se\r\nrencontre un fois sur trois, ni sur cinq, ni meme sur dix, mais bien\r\nseulement sur quinze a vingt.\" Monro (Obs. on Crural Hernia) states this\r\ncondition of the obturator artery to be as 1 in 20-30. Mr. Quain\r\n(Anatomy of the Arteries) gives, as the result of his observations, the\r\nproportion to be as 1 in 3-1/2, and in this estimate he agrees to a\r\ngreat extent with the observations of Cloquet and Hesselbach. Numerical\r\ntables have also been drawn up to show the relative frequency in which\r\nthe obturator descends on the outer and inner borders of the crural ring\r\nand neck of the sac. Sir A. Cooper never met with an example where the\r\nvessel passed on the inner side of the sac, and from this alone it may\r\nbe inferred that such a position of the vessel is very rare. It is\r\ngenerally admitted that the obturator artery, when derived from the\r\nepigastric, passes down much more frequently between the iliac vein and\r\nouter border of the ring. The researches of anatomists (Monro and\r\nothers) in reference to this point have given rise to the question,\r\n\"What determines the position of the obturator artery with respect to\r\nthe femoral ring?\" It appears to me to be one of those questions which\r\ndo not admit of a precise answer by any mode of mathematical\r\ncomputation; and even if it did, where then is the practical inference?]\r\n\r\nThe taxis, in a case of crural hernia, should be conducted in accordance\r\nwith anatomical principles. The fascia lata, Poupart's ligament, and the\r\nabdominal aponeurosis, are to be relaxed by bending the thigh inwards to\r\nthe hypogastrium. By this measure, the falciform process, 6, is also\r\nrelaxed; but I doubt whether the situation occupied by Gimbernat's\r\nligament allows this part to be influenced by any position of the limb\r\nor abdomen. The hernia is then to be drawn from its place above\r\nPoupart's ligament, (if it have advanced so far,) and when brought\r\nopposite the saphenous opening, gentle pressure made outwards, upwards,\r\nand backwards, so as to slip it beneath the margin of the falciform\r\nprocess, will best serve for its reduction. When this cannot be effected\r\nby the taxis, and the stricture still remains, the cutting operation is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe precise seat of the stricture cannot be known except during the\r\noperation. But it is to be presumed that the sac and contained intestine\r\nsuffer constriction throughout the whole length of the canal. [Footnote]\r\nPreviously to the commencement of the operation, the urinary bladder\r\nshould be emptied; for this organ, in its distended state, rises above\r\nthe level of the pubic bone, and may thus be endangered by the incision\r\nthrough the stricture--especially if Gimbernat's ligament be the\r\nstructure which causes it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"The seat of the stricture is not the same in all cases,\r\nthough, in by far the greater number of instances, the constriction is\r\nrelieved by the division upwards and inwards of the falciform process of\r\nthe fascia lata, and the lunated edge of Gimbernat's ligament, where\r\nthey join with each other. In some instances, it will be the fibres of\r\nthe deep crescentic (femoral) arch; in others, again, the neck of the\r\nsac itself, and produced by a thickening and contraction of the\r\nsubserous and peritonaeal membranes where they lie within the\r\ncircumference of the crural ring.\"--Morton (Surgical Anatomy of the\r\nGroin p. 148).]\r\n\r\nAn incision commencing a little way above Poupart's ligament, is to be\r\ncarried vertically over the hernia, parallel with, but to the inner side\r\nof its median line. This incision divides the skin and subcutaneous\r\nadipose membrane, which latter varies considerably in quantity in\r\nseveral individuals. One or two small arteries (superficial pubic, &c.)\r\nmay be divided, and some lymphatic bodies exposed. On cautiously turning\r\naside the incised adipose membrane contained between the two layers of\r\nthe superficial fascia, the fascia propria, 9, Figs. 4, 5, Plate 46, of\r\nthe hernia is exposed. This envelope, besides varying in thickness in\r\ntwo or more cases, may be absent altogether. The fascia closely invests\r\nthe sac, 12; but sometimes a layer of fatty substance interposes between\r\nthe two coverings, and resembles the omentum so much, that the operator\r\nmay be led to doubt whether or not the sac has been already opened. The\r\nfascia is to be cautiously slit open on a director; and now the sac\r\ncomes in view. The hernia having been drawn outwards, so as to separate\r\nit from the inner wall of the crural canal, a director [Footnote] is\r\nnext to be passed along the interval thus left, the groove of the\r\ninstrument being turned to the pubic side. The position of the director\r\nis now between the neck of the sac and the inner wall of the canal. The\r\nextent to which the director passes up in the canal will vary according\r\nto the suspected level of the stricture. A probe-pointed bistoury is now\r\nto be slid along the director, and with its edge turned upwards and\r\ninwards, according to the seat of stricture, the following mentioned\r\nparts are to be divided--viz., the falciform process, 6; the inner wall\r\nof the canal, which is continuous with the fascia propria, 9;\r\nGimbernat's ligament, 8; and the conjoined tendon, 4; where this is\r\ninserted with the ligament into the pectineal ridge. By this mode of\r\nincision, which seems to be all-sufficient for the liberation of the\r\nstricture external to the neck of the sac, we avoid Poupart's ligament;\r\nand thereby the spermatic cord, 3, and epigastric artery, 1, are not\r\nendangered. The crural canal being thus laid open on its inner side, and\r\nthe constricting fibrous bands being severed, the sac may now be gently\r\nmanipulated, so as to restore it and its contents to the cavity of the\r\nabdomen; but if any impediment to the reduction still remain, the cause,\r\nin all probability, arises either from the neck of the sac having become\r\nstrongly adherent to the crural ring, or from the bowel being bound by\r\nbands of false membrane to the sac. In either case, it will be necessary\r\nto open the sac, and examine its contents. The neck of the sac is then\r\nto be exposed by an incision carried through the integument across the\r\nupper end of the first incision, and parallel with Poupart's ligament.\r\nThe neck is then to be divided on its inner side, and the exposed\r\nintestine may now be restored to the abdomen.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The finger is the safest director; for at the same time that\r\nit guides the knife it feels the stricture and protects the bowel. As\r\nall the structures which are liable to become the seat of\r\nstricture--viz., the falciform process, Gimbernat's ligament, and the\r\nconjoined tendon, lie in very close apposition, a very short incision\r\nmade upwards and inwards is all that is required.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 46--Figure 3\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 46--Figure 4\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing bone, blood vessels\r\nand other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 46--Figure 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATE 47.\r\n\r\nTHE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE PRINCIPAL BLOODVESSELS AND\r\nNERVES OF THE ILIAC AND FEMORAL REGIONS.\r\n\r\nThrough the groin, as through the axilla, the principal blood vessels\r\nand nerves are transmitted to, the corresponding limb. The main artery\r\nof the lower limb frequently becomes the subject of a surgical\r\noperation. The vessel is usually described as divisible into parts,\r\naccording to the regions which it traverses. But, as in examining any\r\none of those parts irrespective of the others, many facts of chief\r\nsurgical importance are thereby obscured and overlooked, I propose to\r\nconsider the vessel as a whole, continuous from the aorta to where it\r\nenters the popliteal space. The general course and position of the main\r\nartery may be described as follows:--The abdominal aorta, A, bifurcates\r\non the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The level of the aortic\r\nbifurcation corresponds with the situation of the navel in front, and\r\nthe crista ilii laterally. The aorta is in this situation borne so far\r\nforwards by the lumbar spine as to occupy an almost central position in\r\nthe cavity of the abdomen. If the abdomen were pierced by two lines, one\r\nextending from a little to the left side of the navel, horizontally\r\nbackwards to the fourth lumbar vertebra, and the other from immediately\r\nover the middle of one crista ilii, transversely to a corresponding\r\npoint in the opposite side, these lines would intersect at the aortic\r\nbifurcation. The two arteries, G G,* into which the aorta divides\r\nsymmetrically at the median line, diverge from one another in their\r\ndescent towards the two groins. As both vessels correspond in form and\r\nrelative position, the description of one will serve for the other.\r\n\r\nWhile the thigh is abducted and rotated outwards, if a line be drawn\r\nfrom the navel to a point, D, of the inguinal fold, midway between B,\r\nthe anterior iliac spine, and C, the symphysis pubis, and continued\r\nthence to the inner condyle of the femur, it would indicate the general\r\ncourse of the artery, G I W. In this course, the vessel may be regarded\r\nas a main trunk, giving off at intervals large branches for the supply\r\nof the pelvic organs, the abdominal parietes, and the thigh. From the\r\npoint where the vessel leaves the aorta, A, down to the inguinal fold,\r\nD, it lies within the abdomen, and here, therefore, all operations\r\naffecting the vessel are attended with more difficulty and danger than\r\nelsewhere, in its course.\r\n\r\nThe artery of the lower limb, arising at the bifurcation of the aorta on\r\nthe fourth lumbar vertebra, descends obliquely outwards to the\r\nsacra-iliac junction, and here it gives off its first branch, G,\r\n(internal iliac,) to the pelvic organs. The main vessel is named common\r\niliac, at the interval between its origin from the aorta and the point\r\nwhere it gives off the internal iliac branch. This interval is very\r\nvariable as to its length, but it is stated to be usually two inches.\r\nThe artery, I, continuing to diverge in its first direction from its\r\nfellow of the opposite side, descends along the margin of the true\r\npelvis as far as Poupart's ligament, D, where it gives off its next\r\nprincipal branches,--viz., the epigastric and circumflex iliac. At the\r\ninterval between the internal iliac and epigastric branches, the main\r\nartery, I, is named external iliac; and the surgical length of this part\r\nis also liable to vary, in consequence of the epigastric or circumflex\r\niliac branches arising higher up or lower down than usual. The main\r\nvessel, after passing beneath the middle of Poupart's ligament, D, next\r\ngives off the profundus branch, N, to supply the thigh. This branch\r\ngenerally arises at a point an inch and half or two inches below the\r\nfold of the groin; and between it and the epigastric above, the main\r\nartery is named common femoral. From the point where the profundus\r\nbranch arises, down to the popliteal space, the vessel remains as an\r\nundivided trunk, being destined to supply the leg and foot. In this\r\ncourse, the artery is accompanied by the vein, H K O, which, according\r\nto the region in which it lies, assumes different names, corresponding\r\nto those applied to the artery. Both vessels may now be viewed in\r\nrelation to each other, and to the several structures which lie in\r\nconnexion with them.\r\n\r\nThe two vessels above Poupart's ligament lie behind the intestines, and\r\nare closely invested by the serous membrane. The origin of the vena\r\ncava, F, lies close to the right side of the bifurcation of the aorta,\r\nA; and here both vessels are supported by the lumbar spine. Each of the\r\ntwo arteries, G G,* into which the aorta divides, has its accompanying\r\nvein, H, on its inner side, but the common iliac part of the right\r\nartery is seen to lie upon the upper portions of both the veins, as\r\nthese joining beneath it form the commencement of the vena cava. The\r\nexternal iliac part, I, of each artery has its vein, K, on its inner\r\nside. At the point, G, where the artery gives off its internal iliac\r\nbranch, the ureter, g, crosses it, and thence descends to the bladder.\r\nThe internal iliac branch subdivides in general so soon after its\r\norigin, that it may be regarded as for the most part an unsafe\r\nproceeding to place a ligature upon it.\r\n\r\nThe iliac vessels, A G I, in approaching Poupart's ligament along the\r\nborder of the true pelvis, are supported by the psoas muscle, and\r\ninvested and bound to their place by the peritonaeum, and a thin process\r\nof the iliac fascia. Some lymphatic glands are here found to lie over\r\nthe course of the vessels. The spermatic artery and vein, together with\r\nthe genito-crural nerve, descend along the outer border of the iliac\r\nartery. When arrived at Poupart's ligament, the iliac vessels, I K,\r\nbecome complicated by their own branches, and also by the spermatic\r\nvessels, as these are about to pass from the abdomen through the\r\ninternal inguinal ring. While passing beneath the middle of Poupart's\r\nligament, D, the iliac artery, I, having its vein, K, close to its inner\r\nside, rests upon the inner border of the psoas muscle, and in this place\r\nit may be effectually compressed against the os pubis. The anterior\r\ncrural nerve, P, which in the iliac region lies concealed by the psoas\r\nmuscle, and separated by this from the vessels, now comes into view,\r\nlying on the outer side of the artery. When the vessels have passed from\r\nbeneath Poupart's ligament, the serous membrane no longer covers them,\r\nbut the fibrous membrane is seen to invest them in the form of a sheath,\r\ndivided into two compartments, one of which (internal) receives the\r\nvein, the other the artery. The iliac vessels, in passing to the thigh,\r\nassume the name of femoral.\r\n\r\nThe femoral vessels, O N W, in the upper third of the thigh traverse a\r\ntriangular space, the base of which is formed by Poupart's ligament, D,\r\nwhilst the sides and apex are formed by the sartorius, Q, and adductor\r\nlongus muscles, T, approaching each other. In the undissected state of\r\nthe part, the structures which bound this space can in general be easily\r\nrecognised. A central depression extends from the middle of its base, D,\r\nto its apex, V, and marks the course of the vessels. Near the middle of\r\nPoupart's ligament, the vessels are comparatively superficial, and here\r\nthe artery may be felt pulsating; but lower down, as they approach the\r\napex of the triangle, the vessels become gradually deeper, till the\r\nsartorius muscle inclining from its origin obliquely inwards to the\r\ncentre of the thigh, w, at length overlaps them. The inner border of the\r\nsartorius muscle at the lower part of the upper third of the thigh, W,\r\nguides to the position of the artery. Whilst traversing the femoral\r\ntriangle, the vessels enclosed in their proper sheath are covered by the\r\nfascia lata, adipose membrane, and integument. In this place they lie\r\nimbedded in loose cellular and adipose tissue. The femoral vein, O, is\r\non the same plane with the artery near Poupart's ligament; but from this\r\nplace downwards through the thigh, the vein gradually winds from the\r\ninner to the back part of the artery; and when both vessels pass under\r\ncover of the sartorius, they enter a strong fibrous sheath, V, derived\r\nfrom the tendons of the adductor muscles upon which they lie. The artery\r\napproaches the shaft of the femur near its middle; and in this place it\r\nmay be readily compressed against the bone by the hand. The anterior\r\ncrural nerve, P, dividing on the outer side of the artery, sends some of\r\nits branches coursing over the femoral sheath; and one of these--the\r\nlong saphenous nerve--enters the sheath and follows the artery as far as\r\nthe opening in the great adductor tendon. The femoral artery, before it\r\npasses through this opening into the popliteal space, gives off its\r\nanastomatic branch. The profundus branch, N, springs from the outer side\r\nof the femoral artery usually at a distance of from one to two inches\r\n(seldom more) below Poupart's ligament, and soon subdivides. [Footnote]\r\nThe femoral artery in a few instances has been found double.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The ordinary length of each part of the main artery is stated\r\non the authority of Mr. Quain. See \"Anatomy of the Arteries,\" &c. ]\r\n\r\nThe main artery of the lower limb may be exposed and tied in any part of\r\nits course from the aorta to the popliteal space. But the situation most\r\neligible for performing such an operation depends of course upon\r\ncircumstances, both anatomical and pathological. If an aneurism affect\r\nthe popliteal part of the vessel, or if, from whatever cause arising, it\r\nbe found expedient to tie the femoral above this part, the place best\r\nsuited for the operation is that where the artery, W, first passes under\r\ncover of the sartorius muscle. [Footnote]  For, considering that the\r\nvessel gives off no important branch destined to supply any part of the\r\nthigh or leg between the profundus branch and those into which it\r\ndivides below the popliteal space, the arrest to circulation will be the\r\nsame in amount at whichever part of the vessel between these two points\r\nthe ligature be applied. But since the vessel in the situation specified\r\ncan be reached with greater facility here than elsewhere lower down; and\r\nsince, moreover, a ligature applied to it here will be sufficiently\r\nremoved from the profundus branch above, and the seat of disease below,\r\nto produce the desired result, the choice of the operator is determined\r\naccordingly. The steps of the operation performed at the situation W,\r\nwhere the artery is about to pass beneath the sartorius, are these: an\r\nincision of sufficient length--from two to three inches--is to be made\r\nover the course of the vessel, so as to divide the skin and adipose\r\nmembrane, and expose the fascia lata, through which the inner edge of\r\nthe sartorius muscle becomes now readily discernible. A vein (anterior\r\nsaphena) may be found to cross in this situation, but the saphena vein\r\nproper is not met with, as this lies nearer the inner side of the thigh.\r\nThe fascia having been next divided, the edge of the sartorius is to be\r\nturned aside, and now the pulsation of the artery in its sheath will\r\nindicate its exact position. The sheath is next to be opened, for an\r\nextent sufficient only to carry the point of the ligature-needle safely\r\naround the artery, care being taken not to injure the femoral vein,\r\nwhich lies close behind it, and also to exclude any nerve which may lie\r\nin contact with the vessel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This is the situation chosen by Scarpa for arresting by\r\nligature the circulation through the femoral artery in cases of\r\npopliteal aneurism. The reasons stated in the text are those which\r\ndetermine the surgeon to perform the operation in this place in\r\npreference to that (the lower third of the thigh) where Mr. Hunter first\r\nproposed to tie the vessel.]\r\n\r\nIf an aneurism affect the common femoral portion of the artery, the\r\nexternal iliac part would require to be tied, because, between the seat\r\nof the tumour and the epigastric and circumflex ilii branches above,\r\nthere would not be sufficient space to allow the ligature to rest\r\nundisturbed; and even if the aneurism arose from the femoral below the\r\nprofundus branch in the upper third of the thigh, or if, after\r\namputation of the thigh, a secondary haemorrhage took place from the\r\nfemoral and the profunda arteries, a ligature would with more safety be\r\napplied to the external iliac part than to the common femoral; because\r\nof this latter, even when of its clear normal length, presenting so\r\nsmall an interval between the epigastric and profundus branches. In\r\naddition to this, it must be  noticed, that occasionally the profundus\r\nitself, or some one of its branches, (external and internal circumflex,\r\n&c.), arises as high up as Poupart's ligament, close to the origin of\r\nthe epigastric and circumflex iliac. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The main artery (Plate 47) has been exposed in the iliac and\r\nfemoral regions with the object of showing the relation which its parts\r\nbear to each other and to the whole; all the other dissections have been\r\nmade upon the same plan, the practical tendency of which will be\r\nillustrated when considering the subject of arterial anastomosis.]\r\n\r\nThe external iliac part of the artery, G I, when requiring to be tied,\r\nmay be reached in the following way: an incision, commencing above the\r\nanterior iliac spine, B, is to be carried inwards parallel to, and\r\nabove, Poupart's ligament, D, as far as the outer margin of the internal\r\nabdominal ring. This incision is the one best calculated for avoiding\r\nthe epigastric artery, and for not disturbing the peritonaeum more than\r\nis necessary. The skin and the three abdominal muscles having been\r\nsuccessively incised, the fibrous transversalis fascia is next to be\r\ncarefully divided, so as to expose the peritonaeum. This membrane is\r\nthen to be gently raised by the fingers, from off the iliacus and psoas\r\nmuscles as far inwards as the margin of the true pelvis where the artery\r\nlies. On raising the peritonaeum the spermatic vessels will be found\r\nadhering to it. The iliac artery itself is liable to be displaced by\r\nadhering to the serous membrane, when this is being detached from the\r\ninner side of the psoas muscle. [Footnote] The artery having been\r\ndivested of its serous covering as far up as a point midway between I G,\r\nthe epigastric and internal iliac branches, the ligature is to be passed\r\naround it in this place, as being equidistant from these two sources of\r\ndisturbance. As the vein, K, lies close along the inner side of the\r\nartery, the point of the instrument should first be inserted between\r\nthem, and passed from within outwards, in order to avoid wounding the\r\nvein. If an aneurism affect the upper end of the external iliac artery,\r\nit is proposed to tie the common iliac; but this is an operation of so\r\nserious a nature, that it can in this respect be exceeded only by tying\r\nthe aorta itself. The common iliac artery is so situated, that it can as\r\neasily be reached from the groin upwards as from the side of the abdomen\r\ninwards, and in both directions the peritonaeum would have to be\r\ndisturbed to an equal extent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The student, in operating upon the dead subject, is often\r\npuzzled to find that the iliac artery does not appear in its usual\r\nsituation, unaware at the time that he has lifted the vessel in\r\nconnexion with the peritonaeum. I have once seen a very distinguished\r\nsurgeon, whilst performing this operation on the living body, at fault\r\nowing to the same cause.]\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE 47.\r\n\r\nA.

The viscera of the\r\nabdomen completely fill this region, and transmit to the pelvic organs\r\nall the impressions made upon them by the diaphragm and abdominal walls.\r\nThe expansion of the lungs, the descent of the diaphragm, and the\r\ncontraction of the abdominal muscles, cause the abdominal viscera to\r\ndescend and compress the pelvic organs; and at the same time the muscles\r\noccupying the pelvic outlet, becoming relaxed or contracted, allow the\r\nperinaeum to be protruded or sustained voluntarily according to the\r\nrequirements. Thus it is that the force originated in the muscular\r\nparietes of the thorax and abdomen is, while opposed by the counterforce\r\nof the perinaeal muscles, brought so to bear upon the pelvic organs as\r\nto become the principal means whereby the contents of these are\r\nevacuated. The abdominal muscles are, during this act, the antagonists\r\nof the diaphragm, while the muscles which guard the pelvic outlet become\r\nat the time the antagonists of both. As the pelvic organs appear\r\ntherefore to be little more than passive recipients of their contents,\r\nthe voluntary processes of defecation and micturition may with more\r\ncorrectness be said to be performed rather for them than by them. The\r\nrelations which they bear to the abdomen and its viscera, and their\r\ndependence upon these relations for the due performance of the processes\r\nin which they serve, are sufficiently explained by pathological facts.\r\nThe same system of muscles comprising those of the thorax, abdomen and\r\nperinaeum, performs consentaneously the acts of respiration, vomiting,\r\ndefecation and micturition. When the spinal cord suffers injury above\r\nthe origin of the phrenic nerve, immediate death supervenes, owing to a\r\ncessation of the respiratory act. Considering, however, the effect of\r\nsuch an injury upon the pelvic organs alone, these may be regarded as\r\nbeing absolutely excluded from the pale of voluntary influence in\r\nconsequence of the paralysis of the diaphragm, the abdominal and\r\nperinaeal muscles. The expulsory power over the bladder and rectum being\r\ndue to the opposing actions of these muscles above and below, if the\r\ncord be injured in the neck below the origin of the phrenic nerve, the\r\ninferior muscles becoming paralysed, the antagonism of muscular forces\r\nis thereby interrupted, and the pelvic organs are, under such\r\ncircumstances, equally withdrawn from the sphere of volition. The\r\nantagonism of the abdominal muscles to the diaphragm being necessary, in\r\norder that the pelvic viscera may be acted upon, if the cord be injured\r\nin the lower dorsal region, so as to paralyse the abdominal walls and\r\nthe perinaeal muscles, the downward pressure of the diaphragm alone\r\ncould not evacuate the pelvic organs voluntarily, for the abdominal\r\nmuscles are now incapable of deflecting the line of force backwards and\r\ndownwards through the pelvic axis; and the perinaeal muscles being also\r\nunable to act in agreement, the contents of the viscera pass\r\ninvoluntarily. Again, as the muscular apparatus which occupies the\r\npelvic outlet acts antagonistic to the abdomen and thorax, when by an\r\ninjury to the cord in the sacral spine the perinaeal apparatus alone\r\nbecomes paralysed, its relaxation allows the thoracic and abdominal\r\nforce to evacuate the pelvic organs involuntarily. It would appear,\r\ntherefore, that the term \"paralysis\" of the bladder or rectum, when\r\nfollowing spinal injuries, &c. &c. means, or should mean, only a\r\nparalytic state of the abdomino-pelvic muscular apparatus, entirely or\r\nin part. For, in fact, neither the bladder nor rectum ever acts\r\nvoluntarily per se any more than the stomach does, and therefore the\r\nname \"detrusor\" urinae, as applied to the muscular coat investing the\r\nbladder, is as much a misnomer (if it be meant that the act of voiding\r\nthe organ at will be dependent upon it) as would be the name \"detrusor\"\r\napplied to the muscular coat of the stomach, under the meaning that this\r\nwere the agent in the spasmodic effort of vomiting.\r\n\r\nThe urinary bladder, G, Plate 49, (in the adult body,) occupies the true\r\npelvic region when the organ is collapsed, or only partly distended. It\r\nis situated behind the pubic symphysis and in front of the rectum,\r\nC,--the latter lies between it and the sacrum, A. In early infancy, when\r\nthe pelvis is comparatively small, the bladder is situated in the\r\nhypogastric region, with its summit pointing towards the umbilicus; as\r\nthe bladder varies in shape, according to whether it be empty or full,\r\nits relations to neighbouring parts, especially to those in connexion\r\nwith its summit, vary also considerably. When empty, the back and upper\r\nsurface of the bladder collapse against its forepart, and in this state\r\nthe organ lies flattened against the pubic symphysis. Whether the\r\nbladder be distended or not, the small intestines lie in contact with\r\nits upper surface, and compress it in the manner of a soft elastic\r\ncushion. When distended largely, its summit is raised above the pubic\r\nsymphysis, the small intestines having yielded place to it, and in this\r\nstate it can be felt by the hand laid upon the hypogastrium.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the bladder varies in different individuals. In some it is\r\nrounded, in others pyriform, in others peaked towards its summit. Its\r\ncapacity varies also considerably at different ages and in different\r\nsexes. When distended, its long axis will be found to coincide with a\r\nline passing from a point midway between the navel and pubes to the\r\npoint of the coccyx, the obliquity of this direction being greatest when\r\nthe body is in the erect posture, for the intestines now gravitate upon\r\nit. When the body is recumbent, the bladder recedes somewhat from the\r\npubes, and as the intestines do not now press upon it from above, it\r\nallows of being distended to a much greater degree without causing\r\nuneasiness, and a desire to void its contents.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the bladder is connected to neighbouring parts is\r\nsuch as to admit of its full distension. Its summit, back, and upper\r\nsides are free and covered by the elastic peritonaeum, whilst its front,\r\nlower sides, and base are adherent to adjacent parts, and divested of\r\nthe serous membrane. On tracing the peritonaeum from the front wall of\r\nthe abdomen to its point of reflexion over the summit of the bladder, we\r\nfind the membrane to be in this part so loosely adherent, that the\r\nbladder when much distended, raises the peritonaeum above the level of\r\nthe upper margin of the pubic symphysis. In this state the organ may be\r\npunctured immediately above the pubic symphysis without endangering the\r\nserous sac. When the bladder is collapsed, the peritonaeum follows its\r\nsummit below the level of the pubes, and in this position of the organ\r\nsuch an operation would be inadmissible, if indeed the necessity for it\r\ncan now be conceived.\r\n\r\nBy removing the os innominatum, A D, Plate 48, together with the\r\ninternal obturator, and levator ani muscles, which arise from its inner\r\nside, we obtain a lateral view, Plate 49, of the pelvic viscera, and of\r\nthe vessels &c. connected with them. Those parts of the bladder, G, and\r\nthe rectum, C, which are invested by the peritonaeum, are also now fully\r\ndisplayed. On tracing this membrane from before backwards, over the\r\nsummit of the bladder, G, we find it descending deeply upon the\r\nposterior surface of the organ, before it becomes reflected so as to\r\nascend over the forepart of the rectum. This duplicature of the serous\r\nmembrane, H H, is named the recto-vesical pouch, and it is required to\r\nascertain with all the exactness possible the level to which it\r\ndescends, so as to avoid it in the operation of puncturing the bladder\r\nthrough the rectum. The serous pouch descends lower in some bodies than\r\nin others; but in all there exists a space, of greater or less\r\ndimensions, between it and the prostate, V, whereat the base of the\r\nbladder is in direct apposition with the rectum, W, the serous membrane\r\nnot intervening.\r\n\r\nWhen the peritonaeum is traced from one iliac fossa to the other, we\r\nfind it sinking deeply into the hollow of the pelvis behind the bladder,\r\nso as to form the sides of the recto-vesical pouch; but when traced over\r\nthe summit of the bladder, this organ is seen to have the membrane\r\nreflected upon it, almost immediately below the pelvic brim. At the\r\nsituations where the peritonaeum becomes reflected in front, laterally,\r\nand behind, upon the sides of the bladder, the membrane is thrown into\r\nfolds, which are named \"false ligaments.\" The pelvic fascia, in being\r\nreflected to the bladder from the front and sides of the pelvis, at a\r\nlower level than that of the peritonaeum, forms the \"true ligaments.\" In\r\naddition to these ligaments, which serve to keep the base and front of\r\nthe bladder fixed in the pelvis, other structures, such as the ureters,\r\nK, the vasa deferentia, I, the hypogastric cords, the urachus, and the\r\nbloodvessels, embrace the organ in various directions, and act as\r\nbridles, to limit its expansion more or less in all directions, but\r\nleast so towards its summit, which is always comparatively free.\r\n\r\nThe neck and outlet of the bladder, V, are situated at the anterior part\r\nof its base, and point towards the subpubic space. The prostate gland,\r\nV, surrounds its neck, and occupies a position behind and below the\r\npubic arch, D, and in front of the rectum, W. The gland, V, being of a\r\nrounded form and dense structure, can be felt in this situation by the\r\nfinger, passed upwards through the bowel. The prostate is suspended from\r\nthe back of the pubic arch by the anterior true ligament of the bladder,\r\nand at its forepart, where the membranous portion of the urethra\r\ncommences, this passes through the deep perinaeal fascia, X. The\r\nanterior fibres of the levator ani muscle embrace the prostate on both\r\nits sides. Behind the base of the prostate, the ureter, K, is seen to\r\nenter the coats of the bladder obliquely, whilst the vas deferens, I,\r\njoined by the vesicula seminalis, L, penetrates the substance of the\r\nprostate, V, at its lower and back part, which lies in apposition with\r\nthe rectum.\r\n\r\nThe rectum, W C, at its middle and upper parts, occupies the hollow of\r\nthe sacrum, A Q, and is behind the bladder. The lower third of the\r\nrectum, W, not being covered by the peritonaeum, is that part on which\r\nthe various surgical operations are performed. At its upper\r\nthree-fifths, the rectum describes a curve corresponding to that of the\r\nsacrum; and if the bladder be full, its convex back part presses the\r\nbowel against the bone, causing its curve to be greater than if the\r\nbladder were empty and collapsed. This fact requires to be borne in\r\nmind, for, in order to introduce a bougie, or to allow a large injection\r\nto pass with freedom into the bowel, the bladder should be first\r\nevacuated. The coccygeal bones, Q, continuing in the curve of the\r\nsacrum, bear the rectum, W, forwards against the base of the bladder,\r\nand give to this part a degree of obliquity upwards and backwards, in\r\nrespect to the perinaeum and anus. From the point where the prostate, V,\r\nlies in contact with the rectum, W, this latter curves downwards, and\r\nslightly backwards, to the anus, P. The prostate is situated at a\r\ndistance of about an inch and a half or two inches from the anus--the\r\ndistance varying according to whether the bladder and bowel be distended\r\nor not. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The distance between any two given parts is found to vary in\r\ndifferent cases. \"In subjects of an advanced age,\" Mr. Stanley remarks,\r\n\"a deep perinaeum, as it is termed, is frequently met with. This may be\r\noccasioned either by an unusual quantity of fat in the perinaeum, or by\r\nan enlarged prostate, or by the dilatation of that part of the rectum\r\nwhich is contiguous to the prostate and bladder. Under either of these\r\ncircumstances, the prostate and bladder become situated higher in the\r\npelvis than naturally, and consequently at a greater distance from the\r\nperinaeum.\"--On the Lateral Operation of Lithotomy.]\r\n\r\nThe arteries of the bladder are derived from the branches of the\r\ninternal iliac, S. The rectum receives its arteries from the inferior\r\nmesenteric and pudic. The veins which course upwards from the rectum are\r\nlarge and numerous, and devoid of valves. When these veins become\r\nvaricose, owing to a stagnation of their circulation, produced from\r\nwhatever cause, the bowel is liable to be affected with haemorrhoids or\r\nto assume a haemorrhagic tendency.\r\n\r\nThe pudic artery, S s, is a branch of the internal iliac. It passes from\r\nthe pelvis by the great sciatic foramen, below the pyriformis muscle,\r\nand in company with the sciatic artery. The pudic artery and vein wind\r\naround the spine, E, of the ischium, where they are joined by the pudic\r\nnerve, derived from, T, the sacral plexus. The artery, in company with\r\nthe nerve and vein, re-enters the pelvis by the small sciatic foramen,\r\nand gets under cover of a dense fibrous membrane (obturator fascia),\r\nbetween which and the obturator muscle, it courses obliquely downwards\r\nand forwards to the forepart of the perinaeum. At the place where the\r\nvessel re-enters the pelvis, it lies removed at an interval of an inch\r\nand a half from the perinaeum, but becomes more superficial as it\r\napproaches the subpubic space, N. The levator ani muscle separates the\r\npudic vessels and nerves from the sides of the rectum and bladder. The\r\nprincipal branches given off from the pudic artery of either side, are\r\n(1st), the inferior hemorrhoidal, to supply the lower end of the rectum;\r\n(2nd), the transverse and superficial perinaeal; (3rd), the artery of\r\nthe bulb; (4th), that which enters the corpus cavernosum of the penis,\r\nN; and (5th), the dorsal artery of the penis. [Footnote] The branches\r\ngiven off from the pudic nerve correspond in number and place to those\r\nof the artery. Having now considered the relations of the pelvic organs\r\nin a lateral view, we are better prepared to understand these relations\r\nwhen seen at their perinaeal aspect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The pudic artery, or some one of its branches, occasionally\r\nundergoes marked deviations from the ordinary course. In Mr. Quain's\r\nwork, (\"Anatomy of the Arteries,\") a case is represented in which the\r\nartery of the bulb arose from the pudic as far back as the tuber ischii,\r\nand crossed the line of incision made in the lateral operation of\r\nlithotomy. In another figure is seen a vessel (\"accessory pudic\"),\r\nwhich, passing between the base of the bladder and the levator ani\r\nmuscle, crosses in contact with the left lobe of the prostate.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 48 & 49.\r\n\r\nPLATE 48.\r\n\r\nA.

Every\r\nstructure--superficial as well as deep--which occupies the median line\r\nis either single, by the union of halves, or dual, by the cleavage and\r\npartition of halves. The two sides of the body being absolutely similar,\r\nthe median line at which they unite is therefore common to both. Union\r\nalong the median line is an occlusion taking place by the junction of\r\nsides; and every hiatus or opening, whether normal or abnormal, which\r\nhappens at this line, signifies an omission in the process of central\r\nunion. The sexual peculiarities are the results of the operation of this\r\nlaw, and all forms which are anomalous to either sex, may be interpreted\r\nas gradations in the same process of development; a few of these latter\r\noccasionally come under the notice of the surgeon.\r\n\r\nThe region which extends from the umbilicus to the point of the coccyx\r\nis marked upon the cutaneous surface by a central raphe dividing the\r\nhypogastrium, the penis, the scrotum, and the perinaeum respectively\r\ninto equal and similar sides. The umbilicus is a cicatrix formed after\r\nthe metamorphosis of a median foetal structure--the placental cord, &c.\r\nIn the normal form, the meatus urinarius and the anus coincide with the\r\nline of the median raphe, and signify omissions at stated intervals\r\nalong the line of central union. When between these intervals the\r\nprocess of union happens likewise to be arrested, malformations are the\r\nresult; and of these the following are examples:--Extrusion of the\r\nbladder at the hypogastrium is caused by a congenital hiatus at the\r\nlower part of the linea alba, which is in the median line; Epispadias,\r\nwhich is an urethral opening on the dorsum of the penis; and\r\nHypospadias, which is a similar opening on its under surface, are of the\r\nsame nature--namely, omissions in median union. Hermaphrodism may be\r\ninterpreted simply as a structural defect, compared to the normal form\r\nof the male, and as a structural excess compared to that of the female.\r\nSpina bifida is a congenital malformation or hiatus in union along the\r\nmedian line of the sacrum or loins. As the process of union along the\r\nmedian line may err by a defect or omission, so may it, on the other\r\nhand, err by an excess of fulfilment, as, for example, when the urethra,\r\nthe vagina, or the anus are found to be imperforate. As the median line\r\nof union thus seems to influence the form of the hypogastrium, the\r\ngenitals, and the perinaeum, the dissection of these parts has been\r\nconducted accordingly.\r\n\r\nBy removing the skin and subjacent adipose membrane from the\r\nhypogastrium, we expose the superficial fascia. This membrane, E E E*,\r\nFig. 1, Plate 50, is, in the middle line, adherent to B, the linea alba,\r\nand thereby contributes to form the central depression which extends\r\nfrom the navel to the pubes. The adipose tissue, which in some subjects\r\naccumulates on either side of the linea alba, renders this depression\r\nmore marked in them. At the folds of the groin the fascia is found\r\nadherent to Poupart's ligament, and this also accounts for the\r\ndepressions in both these localities. From the central linea alba to\r\nwhich the fascia adheres, outwards on either side to the folds of both\r\ngroins, the membrane forms two distinct sacs, which droop down in front,\r\nso as to invest the testicles, E**, and penis in a manner similar to\r\nthat of the skin covering these parts. As the two sacs of the\r\nsuperficial fascia join each other at the line B, coinciding with the\r\nlinea alba, they form by that union the suspensory ligament of the\r\npenis, which is a structure precisely median.\r\n\r\nThe superficial fascia having invested the testicles each in a distinct\r\nsac, the adjacent sides of both these sacs, by joining together, form\r\nthe median septum scroti, E, Fig. 2, Plate 50. In the perinaeum, Fig. 1,\r\nPlate 51, the fascia, A, may be traced from the back of the scrotum to\r\nthe anus. In this region the membrane is found to adhere laterally to\r\nthe rami of the ischium and pubes; whilst along the median perinaeal\r\nline the two sacs of which the membrane is composed unite, as in the\r\nscrotum, and form an imperfect septum. In front of the anus, beneath the\r\nsphincter ani, the fascia degenerates into cellular membrane, one layer\r\nof which is spread over the adipose tissue in the ischio-rectal space,\r\nwhilst its deeper and stronger layer unites with the deep perinaeal\r\nfascia, and by this connexion separates the urethral from the anal\r\nspaces. The superficial fascia of the hypogastrium, the scrotum, and the\r\nperinaeum forming a continuous membrane, and being adherent to the\r\nseveral parts above noticed, may be regarded as a general double sac,\r\nwhich isolates the inguino-perinaeal region from the femoral and anal\r\nregions, and hence it happens that when the urethra becomes ruptured,\r\nthe urine which is extravasated in the perinaeum, is allowed to pass\r\nover the scrotum and the abdomen, involving these parts in consequent\r\ninflammation, whilst the thighs and anal space are exempt. The tunicae\r\nvaginales, which form the immediate coverings of the testicles, cannot\r\nbe entered by the urine, as they are distinct sacs originally protruded\r\nfrom the abdomen. It is in consequence of the imperfect state of the\r\ninguino-perinaeal septum of the fascia, that urine effused into one of\r\nthe sacs is allowed to enter the other.\r\n\r\nLike all the other structures which join on either side of the median\r\nline, the penis appears as a symmetrical organ, D D, Fig. 2, Plate 50.\r\nWhile viewed in section, its two corpora cavernosa are seen to unite\r\nanteriorly, and by this union to form a septum \"pectiniforme;\"\r\nposteriorly they remain distinct and lateral, F F, Fig. 2, Plate 51,\r\nbeing attached to the ischio-pubic rami as the crura penis. The urethra,\r\nB, Fig. 2, Plate 50, is also composed of two sides, united along the\r\nmedian line, but forming between them a canal by the cleavage and\r\npartition of the urethral septum. All the other structures of the\r\nperinaeum will be seen to be either double and lateral, or single and\r\nmedian, according as they stand apart from, or approach, or occupy the\r\ncentral line.\r\n\r\nThe perinaeum, Figs. 1, 2, Plate 51, is that space which is bounded\r\nabove by the arch of the pubes, behind by C, the os coccygis, and the\r\nlower borders of, I I, the glutaei muscles and sacro-sciatic ligaments,\r\nand laterally by D D, the ischiatic tuberosities. The osseous boundaries\r\ncan be felt through the integuments. Between the back of the scrotum and\r\nthe anus the perinaeum swells on both sides of the raphe, A B, Fig. 3,\r\nPlate 50, and assumes a form corresponding with the bag of the\r\nsuperficial fascia which encloses the structures connected with the\r\nurethra. The anus is centrally situated in the depression formed between\r\nD D, the ischiatic tuberosities, and the double folds of the nates.\r\n\r\nThe perinaeum, Fig. 3, Plate 50, is, for surgical purposes, described as\r\ndivisible into two spaces (anterior and posterior) by a transverse line\r\ndrawn from one tuber ischii, D, to the other, D, and crossing in front\r\nof the anus. The anterior space, A D D, contains the urethra; the\r\nposterior space, D D C, contains the rectum. The central raphe, A B C,\r\ntraverses both these spaces. The anterior or urethral space is (while\r\nviewed in reference to its osseous boundaries) triangular in shape, the\r\napex being formed by the pubic symphysis beneath A, whilst two lines\r\ndrawn from A to D D, would coincide with the ischio-pubic rami which\r\nform its sides. The raphe in the anterior space indicates the central\r\nposition of the urethra, as may be ascertained by passing a sound into\r\nthe bladder, when the shaft of the instrument will be felt prominently\r\nbetween the points A B. Behind the point B, the sound or staff sinks\r\ndeeper in the perinaeum as it follows the curve of the urethra towards\r\nthe bladder, and becomes overlaid by the bulb, &c.\r\n\r\nThe ischiatic tuberosities, D D, Fig. 3, Plate 50, are, in all subjects,\r\nsufficiently prominent to be felt through the integuments, &c.; and the\r\nline which, when drawn from one to the other, serves to divide the two\r\nperinaeal spaces, forms the base of the anterior one. In well-formed\r\nsubjects, the anterior space is equiangular, the base being equal to\r\neach side; but according as the tuberosities approach the median line,\r\nthe base becomes narrowed, and the triangle is thereby rendered acute.\r\nThese circumstances influence the direction in which the first incision\r\nin the lateral operation of lithotomy should be made. When the\r\ntuberosity of the left ischium stands well apart from the perinaeal\r\ncentre, the line of incision, B E, Fig. 3, Plate 50, is carried\r\nobliquely from above downwards and outwards; but in cases where the\r\ntuberosity approaches the centre, the incision must necessarily be made\r\nmore vertical. The posterior perinaeal space may be described on the\r\nsurface by two lines drawn from D D, the ischiatic tuberosities, to C,\r\nthe point of the coccyx, whilst the transverse line between D and D\r\nbounds it above.\r\n\r\nBy removing the integument and superficial fascia, we expose the\r\nsuperficial vessels and nerves, together with the muscles in the\r\nneighbourhood of the urethra and the anus. The accelerator urinae, E,\r\nFig. 2, Plate 51, which embraces the urethra, and the sphincter ani, B\r\nC, which surrounds the anus, H, occupy the median line, and are divided\r\neach into halves by a central tendon, E B C, which traverses the\r\nperinaeum from before backwards, to the point of the coccyx. On either\r\nside of the anus, in the ischio-rectal space, D D, Fig. 1, Plate 51, is\r\nfound a considerable quantity of granular adipose tissue, traversed by\r\nthe inferior haemorrhoidal arteries and nerves-branches of the pudic\r\nartery and nerve.\r\n\r\nIn front of the anus are seen two small muscles (transversae perinaei),\r\nG G, Fig. 2, Plate 51, each arising from the tuber ischii of its own\r\nside, and the two becoming inserted into, B, the central tendon. These\r\ntransverse muscles serve to mark the boundary between the anterior and\r\nposterior perinaeal spaces. Behind each muscle is found a small artery,\r\ncrossing to the median line. The left transverse muscle and artery are\r\nalways divided in the lateral operation of lithotomy. On the outer sides\r\nof the anterior perinaeal space are seen the erectores penis muscles, F\r\nF, overlaying the crura penis. Between each muscle and the accelerator\r\nurinae, the superficialis perinaei artery and nerve course forwards to\r\nthe scrotum, &c.\r\n\r\nThe perinaeal muscles having been brought fully into view, Plate 52,\r\nFig. 1, their symmetrical arrangement on both sides of the median line\r\nat once strikes the attention. On either side of the anterior space\r\nappears a small angular interval, L, formed between B, the accelerator\r\nurinae, D, the erector penis, and E, the transverse muscle. Along the\r\nsurface of this interval, the superficial perinaeal artery and nerve are\r\nseen to pass forwards; and deep in it, beneath these, may also be\r\nobserved, L, the artery of the bulb, arising from the pudic, and\r\ncrossing inwards, under cover of the anterior layer of the membrane\r\nnamed the deep perinaeal fascia. The first incision in the lateral\r\noperation of lithotomy is commenced over the inferior inner angle of\r\nthis interval.\r\n\r\nThe muscles occupying the anterior perinaeal space require to be\r\nremoved, Fig. 1, Plate 53, in order to expose the urethra, B M, the crus\r\npenis, D, and the deep perinaeal fascia. The fascia will be now seen\r\nstretched across the subpubic triangular space, reaching from one\r\nischio-pubic ramus to the other, whilst by its lower border,\r\ncorresponding with the line of the transversae perinaei muscles, it\r\nbecomes continuous with the superficial fascia, in the manner before\r\ndescribed. The deep perinaeal fascia (triangular ligament) encloses\r\nbetween its two layers, C E, on either side of the urethra, the pudic\r\nartery, the artery of the bulb, Cowper's glands, and some muscular\r\nfibres occasionally to be met with, to which the name \"Compressor\r\nurethrae\" has been assigned. At this stage of the dissection, as the\r\nprincipal vessels and parts composed of erectile tissue are now in view,\r\ntheir relative situations should be well noticed, so as to avoid\r\nwounding them in the several cutting operations required to be performed\r\nin their vicinity.\r\n\r\nAlong the median line (marked by the raphe) from the scrotum to the\r\ncoccyx, and close to this line on either side, the vessels are\r\nunimportant as to size. The urethra lies along the middle line in the\r\nanterior perinaeal space; the rectum occupies the middle in the\r\nposterior space. When either of these parts specially requires to be\r\nincised--the urethra for impassable stricture, &c., and the lower part\r\nof the rectum for fistula in ano--the operation may be performed\r\nwithout fear of inducing dangerous arterial haemorrhage. With the object\r\nof preserving from injury these important parts, deep incisions at, or\r\napproaching to, the middle line must be avoided. The outer\r\n(ischio-pubic) boundary of the perinaeum is the line along which the\r\npudic artery passes. The anterior half of this boundary supports also\r\nthe crus penis; hence, therefore, in order to avoid these, all deep\r\nincisions should be made parallel to, but removed to a proper distance\r\nfrom this situation. The structures placed at the middle line, B M F,\r\nFig. 2, Plate 52, and those in connexion with the left perinaeal\r\nboundary, D G L, require (in order to insure the safety of these parts)\r\nthat the line of incision necessary to gain access to the neck of the\r\nbladder in lithotomy should be made through the left side of the\r\nperinaeum from a point midway between M, the bulb, and D, crus penis\r\nabove, to a point, K, midway between the anus, F, and tuber ischii, G,\r\nbelow. As the upper end of this incision is commenced over the situation\r\nof the superficial perinaeal artery and the artery of the bulb, the\r\nknife at this place should only divide the skin and superficial fascia.\r\nThe lower end, K, just clears the outer side of the dilated lower part\r\nof the rectum. The middle of the incision is over the left lobe of the\r\nprostate gland and neck of the bladder, which parts, together with the\r\nmembranous portion of the urethra, are still concealed by the deep\r\nperinaeal fascia, the structures between its layers, and the anterior\r\nfibres of K, the levator ani muscle. The incision, if made in due\r\nreference to the relative situation of the parts above noticed, will\r\nleave them untouched; but when the pudic artery, or some one of its\r\nbranches, deviates from its ordinary course and crosses the line of\r\nincision, a serious haemorrhage will ensue, despite the anatomical\r\nknowledge of the most experienced operator. When it is requisite to\r\ndivide the superficial and deep sphincter ani as in the operation for\r\ncomplete fistula in ano, if the incision be made transversely in the\r\nischio-rectal fossa, the haemorrhoidal arteries and nerves converging\r\ntowards the anus will be the more likely to escape being wounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 50 & 51.\r\n\r\nPLATE 50.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.\r\n\r\nA.

The\r\nanterior layer of the fascia is continued forwards over the bulb, whilst\r\nthe posterior layer is reflected backwards over the prostate gland.\r\n\r\nBehind the deep perinaeal fascia, the anterior fibres of K, the levator\r\nani muscle, arise from either side of the pubic symphysis posteriorly,\r\nand descend obliquely down wards and forwards, to be inserted into the\r\nsides of N N, the rectum above the anus. These fibres of the muscle, and\r\nthe lower border of the fascia which covers them, lie immediately in\r\nfront of the prostate, C C, Fig. 2, Plate 53, and must necessarily be\r\ndivided in the operation of lithotomy. Previously to disturbing the\r\nlower end of the rectum from its natural position in the perinaeum, its\r\nclose relation to the prostate and base of the bladder should be\r\nnoticed. While the anus remains connected with the deep perinaeal fascia\r\nin front, the fibres of the levator ani muscle of the left side may be\r\ndivided; and by now inserting the finger between them and the rectum,\r\nthe left lobe of the prostate can be felt in apposition with the\r\nforepart of the bowel, an inch or two above the anus. It is owing to\r\nthis connexion between these parts that the lithotomist has to depress\r\nthe bowel, lest it be wounded, while the prostate is being incised. If\r\neither the bowel or the bladder, or both together, be over-distended,\r\nthey are brought into closer apposition, and the rectum is consequently\r\nmore exposed to danger during the latter stages of the operation. The\r\nprostate being in contact with the rectum, the surgeon is enabled to\r\nexamine by the touch, per anum, the state of the gland. If the prostate\r\nbe diseased and irregularly enlarged, the urethra, which passes through\r\nit, becomes, in general, so distorted, that the surgeon, after passing\r\nthe catheter along the urethra as far as the prostate, will find it\r\nnecessary to guide the point of the instrument into the bladder, by the\r\nfinger introduced into the bowel. The middle or third lobe of the\r\nprostate being enlarged, bends the prostatic part of the urethra\r\nupwards. But when either of the lateral lobes is enlarged, the urethra\r\nbecomes bent towards the opposite side.\r\n\r\nBy dividing the levator ani muscle on both sides of the rectum, F, Fig.\r\n2, Plate 53, and detaching and depressing this from the perinaeal\r\ncentre, the prostate, C C, and base of the bladder, P, are brought into\r\nview. The pelvic fascia may be now felt reflected from the inner surface\r\nof the levator ani muscle to the bladder at a level corresponding with\r\nthe base of the prostate, and the neck of the bladder in front, and the\r\nvesiculae seminales, N N, laterally. In this manner the pelvic fascia\r\nserves to insulate the perinaeal space from the pelvic cavity. The\r\nprostate occupies the centre of the perinaeum. If the perinaeum were to\r\nbe penetrated at a point midway between the bulb of the urethra and the\r\nanus, and to the depth of two inches straight backwards, the instrument\r\nwould transfix the apex of the gland. Its left lobe lies directly under\r\nthe middle of the line of incision which the lithotomist makes through\r\nthe surface; a fibrous membrane forms a capsule for the gland, and\r\nrenders its surface tough and unyielding, but its proper substance is\r\nfriable, and may be lacerated or dilated with ease, after having partly\r\nincised its fibrous envelope. The membranous part of the urethra, M,\r\nFig. 2, Plate 53, enters the apex of the prostate, and traverses this\r\npart in a line, nearer to the upper than to the under surface; and that\r\nportion of the canal which the gland surrounds, is named prostatic. The\r\nprostate is separated from the pudic artery by the levator ani muscle,\r\nand from the artery of the bulb, by the deep perinaeal fascia and the\r\nmuscular fibres enclosed between its two layers.\r\n\r\nThe prostate being a median structure, is formed of two lobes, united at\r\nthe median line. The bulbus urethrae being also a median structure, is\r\noccasionally found notched in the centre, and presenting a bifid\r\nappearance. On the base of the bladder, P, Fig. 2, Plate 53, the two\r\nvasa deferentia, Q Q, are seen to converge from behind forwards, and\r\nenter the base of the gland; a triangular interval is thus formed\r\nbetween the vasa, narrower before than behind, and at the middle of this\r\nplace the point of the trocar is to be passed (through the rectum,) for\r\nthe purpose of evacuating the contents of the bladder, when other\r\nmeasures fail. When this operation is required to be performed, the\r\nsituation of the prostate is first to be ascertained through the bowel;\r\nand at a distance of an inch behind the posterior border of the gland,\r\nprecisely in the median line, the distended base of the bladder may be\r\nsafely punctured. If the trocar pierce the bladder at this point, the\r\nseminal vessels converging to the prostate from either side, and the\r\nrecto-vesical serous pouch behind, will escape being wounded. If the\r\nprostate happen to be much enlarged, the relative position of the\r\nneighbouring parts will be found disturbed, and in such case the bladder\r\ncan be punctured above the pubes with greater ease and safety. In cases\r\nof impassable stricture, when extravasation of urine is threatened, or\r\nhas already occurred, the urethra should be opened in the perinaeum\r\nbehind the place where the stricture is situated, and this (in the\r\npresent instance) certainly seems to be the more effectual measure, for\r\nat the same time that the stricture is divided, the contents of the\r\nbladder may be evacuated through the perinaeum. If the membranous part\r\nof the urethra be that where the stricture exists, a staff with a\r\ncentral groove is to be passed as far as the strictured part, and having\r\nascertained the position of the instrument by the finger in the bowel,\r\nthe perinaeum should be incised, at the middle line, between the bulb of\r\nthe urethra and the anus. The urethra in this situation will be found to\r\ncurve backwards at the depth of an inch or more from the surface. The\r\npoint of the staff is now to be felt for, and the urethra is to be\r\nincised upon it. The bistoury is next to be carried backwards through\r\nthe stricture till it enters that part of the urethra (usually dilated\r\nin such cases) which intervenes between the seat of obstruction and the\r\nneck of the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe lateral operation of lithotomy is to be performed according to the\r\nabove described anatomical relations of the parts concerned. The bowel\r\nbeing empty and the bladder moderately full, a staff with a groove in\r\nits left side is to be passed by the urethra into the bladder. The\r\nposition and size of the prostate is next to be ascertained by the left\r\nfore-finger in the rectum. Having now explored the surface of the\r\nperinaeum in order to determine the situation of the left tuberosity and\r\nischio-pubic ramus, in relation to the perinaeal middle line, the staff\r\nbeing held steadily against the symphysis pubis, the operator proceeds\r\nto divide the skin and superficial fascia on the left side of the\r\nperinaeum, commencing the incision on the left of the raphe about an\r\ninch in front of the anus, and carrying it downwards and outwards midway\r\nbetween the anus and ischiatic tuberosity, to a point below these parts.\r\nThe left fore-finger is then to be passed along the incision for the\r\npurpose of parting the loose cellular tissue; and any of the more\r\nresisting structures, such as the transverse and levator ani muscles,\r\nare to be divided by the knife. Deep in the forepart of the wound, the\r\nposition of the staff is now to be felt for, and the structures which\r\ncover the membranous portion of the urethra are to be cautiously\r\ndivided. Recollecting now that the artery of the bulb passes anterior to\r\nthe staff in the urethra on a level with the bulb, the vessel is to be\r\navoided by inserting the point of the knife in the groove of the staff\r\nas far backwards--that is, as near the apex of the prostate--as\r\npossible. The point of the knife having been inserted in the groove of\r\nthe staff, the bowel is then to be depressed by the left fore-finger;\r\nand now the knife, with its back to the staff, and its edge lateralized\r\n(towards the lower part of the left tuber ischii), is to be pushed\r\nsteadily along the groove in the direction of the staff, and made to\r\ndivide the membranous part of the urethra and the anterior two-thirds of\r\nthe left lobe of the prostate. The gland must necessarily be divided to\r\nthis extent if the part of the urethra which it surrounds be traversed\r\nby the knife. The extent to which the prostate is divided depends upon\r\nthe degree of the angle which the knife, passing along the urethra,\r\nmakes with the staff. The greater this angle is, the greater the extent\r\nto which the gland will be incised. The knife being next withdrawn, the\r\nleft fore-finger is to be passed through the opening into the bladder,\r\nand the parts are to be dilated by the finger as it proceeds, guided by\r\nthe staff. The staff is now to be removed while the point of the finger\r\nis in the neck of the bladder, and the forceps is to be passed into the\r\nbladder along the finger as a guide. The calculus, now in the grip of\r\nthe forceps, is to be extracted by a slow undulating motion.\r\n\r\nThe general rules to be remembered and adopted in performing the\r\noperation of lithotomy are as follow:--1st, The incision through the\r\nskin and sub-cutaneous cellular membrane should be freely made, in order\r\nthat the stone may be easily extracted and the urine have ready egress.\r\nThe incision which (judging from the anatomical relations of the parts)\r\nappears to be best calculated to effect these objects, is one which\r\nwould extend from a point an inch above the anus to a point in the\r\nposterior perinaeal space an inch or more below the anus. The wound thus\r\nmade would depend in relation to the neck of the bladder; the important\r\nparts, vessels, &c., in the anterior perinaeal space would be avoided\r\nwhere the incision, if extended upwards, would have no effect whatever\r\nin facilitating the extraction of the stone or the egress of the urine;\r\nand what is also of prime importance, the external opening would\r\ndirectly correspond with the incision through the prostate and neck of\r\nthe bladder. 2nd, After the incision through the skin and superficial\r\nfascia is made, the operator should separate as many of the deeper\r\nstructures as will admit of it, by the finger rather than by the knife;\r\nand especially use the knife cautiously towards the extremities of the\r\nwound, so as to avoid the artery of the bulb, and the bulb itself in the\r\nupper part, and the rectum below. The pudic artery will not be\r\nendangered if the deeper parts be divided by the knife, with its edge\r\ndirected downwards and outwards, while its point slides securely along\r\nthe staff in the prostate. 3rd, The prostate should be incised\r\nsparingly, for, in addition to the known fact that the gland when only\r\npartly cut admits of dilatation to a degree sufficient to admit the\r\npassage of even a stone of large size, it is also stated upon high\r\nauthority that by incising the prostate and neck of the bladder to a\r\nlength equal to the diameter of the stone, such a proceeding is more\r\nfrequently followed with disastrous results, owing to the circumstance\r\nthat the pelvic fascia being divided at the place where it is reflected\r\nupon the base of the gland and the side and neck of the bladder, allows\r\nthe urine to infiltrate the cellular tissue of the pelvis. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: \"The object in following this method,\" Mr. Liston observes,\r\n\"is to avoid all interference with the reflexion of the ilio-vesical\r\nfascia from the sides of the pelvic cavity over the base of the gland\r\nand side of the bladder. If this natural boundary betwixt the external\r\nand internal cellular tissue is broken up, there is scarcely a\r\npossibility of preventing infiltration of the urine, which must almost\r\ncertainly prove fatal. The prostate and other parts around the neck of\r\nthe bladder are very elastic and yielding, so that without much solution\r\nof their continuity, and without the least laceration, the opening can\r\nbe so dilated as to admit the fore-finger readily through the same\r\nwound; the forceps can be introduced upon this as a guide, and they can\r\nalso be removed along with a stone of considerable dimensions, say from\r\nthree to nearly five inches in circumference, in one direction, and from\r\nfour to six in the largest.\"--Practical Surgery, page 510. This doctrine\r\n(founded, no doubt, on Mr. Liston's own great experience) coincides with\r\nthat first expressed by Scarpa, Le Cat, and others. Sir Benjamin Brodie,\r\nMr. Stanley, and Mr. Syme are also advocates for limited incisions,\r\nextending no farther than a partial division of the prostate, the rest\r\nbeing effected by dilatation. The experience, however, of Cheselden,\r\nMartineau, and Mr. S. Cooper, inclined them in favour of a rather free\r\nincision of the prostate and neck of the bladder proportioned to the\r\nsize of the calculus, so that this may be extracted freely, without\r\nlacerating or contusing the parts, \"and,\" says the distinguished\r\nlithotomist Klein, \"upon this basis rests the success of my operations;\r\nand hence I invariably make it a rule to let the incision be rather too\r\nlarge than too small, and never to dilate it with any blunt instrument\r\nwhen it happens to be too diminutive, but to enlarge it with a knife,\r\nintroduced, if necessary, several times.\"--Practische Ansichten der\r\nBedeutendsten Chirurgische Operationen. Opinions of the highest\r\nauthority being thus opposed, in reference to the question whether free\r\nor limited incisions in the neck of the bladder are followed\r\nrespectively by the greater number of fatal or favourable results, and\r\nthese being thought mainly to depend upon whether the pelvic fascia be\r\nopened or not, one need not hesitate to conclude, that since facts seem\r\nto be noticed in support of both modes of practice equally, the issue of\r\nthe cases themselves must really be dependent upon other circumstances,\r\nsuch as the state of the constitution, the state of the bladder, and the\r\nrelative position of the internal and external incisions. \"Some\r\nindividuals (observes Sir B. Brodie) are good subjects for the\r\noperation, and recover perhaps without a bad symptom, although the\r\noperation may have been very indifferently performed. Others may be\r\ntruly said to be bad subjects, and die, even though the operation be\r\nperformed in the most perfect manner. What is it that constitutes the\r\nessential difference between these two classes of cases? It is,\r\naccording to my experience, the presence or absence of organic\r\ndisease.\"--Diseases of the Urinary Organs.]\r\n\r\nThe position in which the staff is held while the membranous urethra and\r\nprostate are being divided should be regulated by the operator himself.\r\nIf he requires the perinaeum to be protruded and the urethra directed\r\ntowards the place of the incision, he can effect this by depressing the\r\nhandle of the instrument a little towards the right groin, taking care\r\nat the same time that the point is kept beyond the prostate in the\r\ninterior of the bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES OF PLATES 52 & 53.\r\n\r\nPLATE 52.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.\r\n\r\nA.

The\r\nmedian line, AA, drawn from the symphysis pubis above, to the point of\r\nthe coccyx below, is seen to traverse vertically the centres of the\r\nurethra, the prostate, the base of the bladder, the anus, and the\r\nrectum. These several parts are situated at different depths from the\r\nperinaeal surface. The bulb of the urethra and the lower end of the\r\nbowel are on the same plane comparatively superficial. The prostate lies\r\nbetween these two parts, and on a plane deeper than they. The base of\r\nthe bladder is still more deeply situated than the prostate; and hence\r\nit is that the end of the bowel is allowed to advance so near the\r\npendent bulb, that those parts are in a great measure concealed by\r\nthese. As the apex of the prostate lies an inch (more or less) deeper\r\nthan the bulb, so the direction of the membranous urethra, which\r\nintervenes between the two, is according to the axis of the pelvic\r\noutlet; the prostatic end of the membranous urethra being deeper than\r\nthe part near the bulb. The scalpel of the lithotomist, guided by the\r\nstaff in this part of the urethra, is made to enter the neck of the\r\nbladder deeply in the same direction. On comparing the course of the\r\npudic arteries with the median line, A A, we find that they are removed\r\nfrom it at a wider interval below than above; and also that where the\r\nvessels first enter the perinaeal space, winding around the spines of\r\nthe ischia, they are much deeper in this situation (on a level with the\r\nbase of the bladder) than they are when arrived opposite the bulb of the\r\nurethra. The transverse line B B, drawn in front of the anus from one\r\ntuber ischii to the other, is seen to divide the perinaeum into the\r\nanterior and posterior spaces, and to intersect at right angles the\r\nmedian line A A. In the same way the line B B divides transversely both\r\npudic arteries, the front of the bowel, the base of the prostate, and\r\nthe sides of the neck of the bladder. Lateral lithotomy is performed in\r\nreference to the line A A; the bilateral operation in regard to the line\r\nB B. In order to avoid the bulb and rectum at the median line, and the\r\npudic artery at the outer side of the perinaeum, the lateral incisions\r\nare made obliquely in the direction of the lines CD. In the bilateral\r\noperation the incision necessary to avoid the bulb of the urethra in\r\nfront, the rectum behind, and the pudic arteries laterally, is required\r\nto be made of a semicircular form, corresponding with the forepart of\r\nthe bowel; the cornua of the incision being directed behind. In the\r\nlateral operation, the incision C through the integument, crosses at an\r\nacute angle the deeper incision D, which divides the neck of the\r\nbladder, the prostate, &c. The left lobe of the prostate is divided\r\nobliquely in the lateral operation; both lobes transversely in the\r\nbilateral.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 54, Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 54.--If the artery of the bulb happen to arise from the\r\npudic opposite the tuber ischii, or if the inferior hemorrhoidal\r\narteries be larger than usual, these vessels crossing the lines of\r\nincision in both operations will be divided. If the superficial lateral\r\nincision C, Fig. 1, be made too deeply at its forepart, the artery of\r\nthe bulb, even when in its usual place, will be wounded; and if the deep\r\nlateral incision D be carried too far outwards, the trunk of the pudic\r\nartery will be severed. These accidents are incidental in the bilateral\r\noperation also, in performing which it should be remembered that the\r\nbulb is in some instances so large and pendulous, as to lie in contact\r\nwith the front of the rectum.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 54, Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 55.--When the pudic artery crosses in contact with the\r\nprostate, F, it must inevitably be divided in either mode of operation.\r\nJudging from the shape of the prostate, I am of opinion that this part,\r\nwhether incised transversely in the line B B, or laterally in the line\r\nD, will exhibit a wound in the neck of the bladder of equal dimensions.\r\nWhen the calculus is large, it is recommended to divide the neck of the\r\nbladder by an incision, combined of the transverse and the lateral. The\r\nadvantages gained by such a combination are, that while the surface of\r\nthe section made in the line D is increased by \"notching\" the right lobe\r\nof the prostate in the direction of the line B, the sides of both\r\nsections are thereby rendered more readily separable, so as to suit with\r\nthe rounded form of the calculus to be extracted. These remarks are\r\nequally applicable as to the mode in which the superficial perinaeal\r\nincision should be made under the like necessity. If the prostate be\r\nwholly divided in either line of section, the pelvic fascia adhering to\r\nthe base of this body will be equally subject to danger. By incising the\r\nprostate transversely, B B, the seminal ducts, G H, which enter the base\r\nof this body, are likewise divided; but by the simple lateral incision D\r\nbeing made through the forepart of the left lobe, F, these ducts will\r\nescape injury. [Footnote] On the whole, therefore, the lateral operation\r\nappears preferable to the bilateral one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As to the mode in which the superficial and deep incisions in\r\nlateral lithotomy should be made, a very eminent operating surgeon\r\nremarks--\"a free incision of the skin I consider a most important\r\nfeature in the operation; but beyond this the application of the knife\r\nshould, in my opinion, be extremely limited. In so far as I can\r\nperceive, there should be no hesitation in cutting any part of the gland\r\nwhich seems to offer resistance, with the exception, perhaps, of its\r\nunder surface, where the position of the seminal ducts, and other\r\ncircumstances, should deter the surgeon from using a cutting\r\ninstrument.\"--Wm. Fergusson, Practical Surgery, 3d Am. Ed., p. 610.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 55--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 55.--The muscular structures surrounding the membranous\r\nurethra and the neck of the bladder, and which are divided in lithotomy,\r\nhave been examined from time to time by anatomists with more than\r\nordinary painstaking, owing to the circumstance that they are found\r\noccasionally to offer, by spasmodic contraction, an obstacle to the\r\npassage of the catheter along the urethral canal. These muscles do not\r\nappear to exist in all subjects alike. In some, they are altogether\r\nwanting; in others, a few of them only appear; in others, they seem to\r\nbe not naturally separable from the larger muscles which are always\r\npresent. Hence it is that the opinions of anatomists respecting their\r\nform, character, and even their actual existence, are so conflicting,\r\nnot only against each other, but against nature. In Fig. 2, Plate 55, I\r\nhave summed together all the facts recorded concerning them, [Footnote]\r\nand on comparing these facts with what I have myself observed, the\r\nmuscles seem to me to assume originally the form and relative position\r\nof the parts B C D E F viewed in their totality. Each of these parts of\r\nmuscular structure arises from the ischio-pubic ramus, and is inserted\r\nat the median line A A. They appear to me, therefore, to be muscles of\r\nthe same category, which, if all were present, would assume the serial\r\norder of B C D E F. When one or more of them are omitted from the\r\nseries, there occurs anatomical variety, which of course occasions\r\nvariety in opinion, fruitless though never ending. By that\r\ninterpretation of the parts which I here venture to offer, and to which\r\nI am guided by considerations of a higher law of formation, I encompass\r\nand bind together, as with a belt, all the dismembered parts of variety,\r\nand of these I construct a uniform whole. Forms become, when not viewed\r\nunder comparison, as meaningless hieroglyphics, as the algebraic symbols\r\na + c - d = 11 are when the mind is devoid of the power of calculation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The part C is that alone described by Santorini, who named it\r\n\"elevator urethrae,\" as passing beneath the urethra. The part B is that\r\nfirst observed and described by Mr. Guthrie as passing above the\r\nurethra. The part F represents the well-known \"transversalis perinaei,\"\r\nbetween which and the part C there occasionally appears the part E,\r\nsupposed to be the \"transversalis alter\" of Albinus, and also the part\r\nD, which is the \"ischio bulbosus\" of Cruveilhier. It is possible that I\r\nmay not have given one or other of these parts its proper name, but this\r\nwill not affect their anatomy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 55--Figure 2\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 55.--The membranous urethra A is also in some instances\r\nembraced by two symmetrical fasciculi of muscular fibres B B, which\r\narising from the posterior and lower part of the symphysis pubis,\r\ndescend on either side of the canal and join beneath it. The muscles B\r\nC, Fig. 2, Plate 55, are between the two layers of the deep perinaeal\r\nfascia, while the muscle B B, Fig. 3, Plate 55, lies like the forepart\r\nof the levator ani, C C, behind this structure and between it and the\r\nanterior ligaments of the bladder. [Footnote] As to the interpretation\r\nof the muscle, I, myself, am inclined to believe that it is simply a\r\npart of the levator ani, and for these reasons--1st, it arises from the\r\npubic symphysis, and is inserted into the perinaeal median line with the\r\nlevator ani; 2nd, the fibres of both muscles overlie the forepart of the\r\nprostate, and present the same arrangement in parallel order; 3rd, the\r\none is not naturally separable from the other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This is the muscle, B B, which is described by Santorini as\r\nthe \"levator prostatae;\" by Winslow as \"le prostatique superieur;\" by\r\nWilson as the \"pubo-urethrales;\" by Muller as not existing; by Mr.\r\nGuthrie as forming (when existing), with the parts B C, Fig. 2, Plate\r\n55, his \"compressor isthmi urethrae;\" and by M. Cruveilhier as being\r\npart of the levator ani muscle. \"As in one case,\" (observes Mr. Quain,)\r\n\"I myself saw a few vertical muscular fibres connected with the\r\ntransverse compressor, it has been thought best to retain the muscle in\r\nthe text.\"--Dr. Quain's Anat., Am. Ed. vol. ii. p. 539.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 55--Figure 3\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 56, represents by section the natural forms of the urethra\r\nand bladder. The general direction of the urethra measured during its\r\nrelaxed state from the vesical orifice to the glans is usually described\r\nas having the form of the letter S laid procumbent to the right side\r\n[capital S rotated 90 degrees right] or to the left [capital S rotated\r\n90 degrees left]. But as the anterior half of the canal is moveable, and\r\nliable thereby to obliterate the general form, while the posterior half\r\nis fixed, I shall direct attention to the latter half chiefly, since\r\nupon its peculiar form and relative position depends most of the\r\ndifficulty in the performance of catheterism. The portion of the urethra\r\nwhich intervenes between the neck of the bladder, K, and the point E,\r\nwhere the penis is suspended from the front of the symphysis pubis by\r\nthe suspensory ligament, assumes very nearly the form of a semicircle,\r\nwhose anterior half looks towards the forepart, and whose posterior half\r\nis turned to the back of the pubis. The pubic arch, A, spans crossways,\r\nthe middle of this part of the urethra, G, opposite the bulb H. The two\r\nextremes, F K, of this curve, and the lower part of the symphysis pubis,\r\noccupy in the adult the same antero-posterior level; and it follows,\r\ntherefore, that the distance to which the urethra near its bulb, H, is\r\nremoved from the pubic symphysis above must equal the depth of its own\r\ncurve, which measures about an inch perpendicularly. The urethral\r\naperture of the triangular ligament appears removed at this distance\r\nbelow the pubic symphysis, and that portion of the canal which lies\r\nbehind the ligament, and ascends obliquely backwards and upwards to the\r\nvesical orifice on a level with the symphysis pubis in the adult should\r\nbe remembered, as varying both in direction and length in individuals of\r\nthe extremes of age. In the young, this variation is owing to the usual\r\nhigh position of the bladder in the pelvis, whilst in the old it may be\r\ncaused by an enlarged state of the prostate. The curve of the urethra\r\nnow described is permanent in all positions of the body, while that\r\nportion of the canal anterior to the point F, which is free, relaxed,\r\nand moveable, can by traction towards the umbilicus be made to continue\r\nin the direction of the fixed curve F K, and this is the general form\r\nwhich the urethra assumes when a bent catheter of ordinary shape is\r\npassed along the canal into the bladder. The length of the urethra\r\nvaries at different ages and in different individuals, and its structure\r\nin the relaxed state is so very dilatable that it is not possible to\r\nestimate the width of its canal with fixed accuracy. As a general rule,\r\nthe urethra is much more dilatable, and capable consequently of\r\nreceiving an instrument of much larger bore in the aged than in the\r\nadult.\r\n\r\nThe three portions into which the urethra is described as being\r\ndivisible, are the spongy, the membranous, and the prostatic. These\r\nnames indicate the difference in the structure of each part. The spongy\r\nportion is the longest of the three, and extending from the glans to the\r\nbulb may be said on a rough, but for practical purposes, a sufficiently\r\naccurate estimate to comprise seven parts of the whole urethra, which\r\nmeasures nine. The membranous and prostatic portions measure\r\nrespectively one part of the whole. These relative proportions of the\r\nthree parts are maintained in different individuals of the same age, and\r\nin the same individual at different ages. The spongy part occupies the\r\ninferior groove formed between the two united corpora cavernosa of the\r\npenis, and is subcutaneous as far back as the scrotum under the pubes,\r\nbetween which point and the bulb it becomes embraced by the accelerator\r\nurinae muscle. The bulb and glans are expansions or enlargements of the\r\nspongy texture, and do not affect the calibre of the canal. When the\r\nspongy texture becomes injected with blood, the canal is rendered much\r\nnarrower than otherwise. The canal of the urethra is\r\nuniform-cylindrical. The meatus is the narrowest part of it, and the\r\nprostatic part is the widest. At the point of junction between the\r\nmembranous and spongy portions behind the bulb, the canal is described\r\nas being naturally constricted. Behind the meatus exists a dilatation\r\n(fossa navicularis), and opposite the bulb another (sinus of the bulb).\r\nMuscular fibres are said to enter into the structure of the urethra, but\r\nwhether such be the case or not, it is at least very certain that they\r\nnever prove an obstacle to the passage of instruments, or form the\r\nvariety of stricture known as spasmodic. The urethra is lined by a\r\ndelicate mucous membrane presenting longitudinal folds, which become\r\nobliterated by distention; and its entire surface is numerously studded\r\nwith the orifices of mucous cells (lacunae), one of which, larger than\r\nthe rest, appears on the upper side of the canal near the meatus. Some\r\nof these lacunae are nearly an inch long, and all of them open in an\r\noblique direction forwards. Instruments having very narrow apices are\r\nliable to enter these ducts and to make false passages. The ducts of\r\nCowper's glands open by very minute orifices on the sides of the spongy\r\nurethra anterior to and near the bulb. On the floor of the prostatic\r\nurethra appears the crest of the veru montanum, upon which the two\r\nseminal ducts open by orifices directed forwards. On either side of the\r\nveru montanum the floor of the prostate may be seen perforated by the\r\n\"excretory ducts\" of this so-called gland. The part K, which is here\r\nrepresented as projecting from the floor of the bladder, near its neck,\r\nis named the \"uvula vesicae,\" (Lieutaud.) It is the same as that which\r\nis named the \"third lobe of the prostate,\" (Home.) The part does not\r\nappear as proper to the bladder in the healthy condition, Fig. 2, Plate\r\n56. On either side of the point K may be seen the orifices, M M, of the\r\nureters, opening upon two ridges of fibrous substance directed towards\r\nthe uvula. These are the fibres which have been named by Sir Charles\r\nBell as \"the muscles of the ureters;\" but as they do not appear in the\r\nbladder when in a state of health, I do not believe that nature ever\r\nintended them to perform the function assigned to them by this\r\nanatomist. And the same may be said of the fibres, which surrounding the\r\nvesical orifice, are supposed to act as the \"sphincter vesicae.\" The\r\nform of that portion of the base of the bladder which is named \"trigone\r\nvesical\" constitutes an equilateral triangle, and may be described by\r\ntwo lines drawn from the vesical orifice to both openings of the\r\nureters, and another line reaching transversely between the latter.\r\nBehind the trigone a depression called \"bas fond\" is formed in the base\r\nof the bladder. Fig. 2, Plate 56, represents the prostate of a boy nine\r\nyears of age. Fig. 3, Plate 56, represents that of a man aged forty\r\nyears. A difference as to form and size, &c., is observable between\r\nboth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abdomen, showing blood vessels and other internal organs.]\r\nPlate 56--Figure 1, 2, 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 57 & 58.\r\n\r\nCONGENITAL AND PATHOLOGICAL DEFORMITIES OF THE PREPUCE AND\r\nURETHRA.--STRICTURE AND MECHANICAL OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen any of the central organs of the body presents in a form differing\r\nfrom that which we term natural, or structurally perfect and efficient,\r\nif the deformity be one which results as a malformation, ascribable to\r\nan error in the law of development, it is always characterized as an\r\nexcess or defect of the substance of the organ at, and in reference to,\r\nthe median line. And when any of the canals which naturally open upon\r\nthe external surface at the median line happens to deviate from its\r\nproper position, such deviation, if it be the result of an error in the\r\nlaw of development, always occurs, by an actual necessity, at the median\r\nline. On the contrary, though deformities which are the results of\r\ndiseased action in a central organ may and do, in some instances,\r\nsimulate those which occur by an error in the process of development,\r\nthe former cannot bear a like interpretation with the latter, for those\r\nare the effects of ever-varying circumstances, whereas these are the\r\neffects of certain deviations in a natural process--a law, whose course\r\nis serial, gradational, and in the sequent order of a continuous chain\r\nof cause and effect.\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 57, represents the prepuce in a state of congenital\r\nphymosis. The part hypertrophied and pendent projects nearly an inch in\r\nfront of the meatus, and forms a canal, continued forwards from this\r\norifice. As the prepuce in such a state becomes devoid of its proper\r\nfunction, and hence must be regarded, not only as a mere superfluity,\r\nbut as a cause of impediment to the generative function of the whole\r\norgan, it should be removed by an operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 57, represents the prepuce in the condition of\r\nparaphymosis following gonorrhoeal inflammation. The part appears\r\nconstricting the penis and urethra behind the corona glandis. This state\r\nof the organ is produced in the following-mentioned way:--the prepuce,\r\nnaturally very extensible, becomes, while covering the glans, inflamed,\r\nthickened, and its orifice contracted. It is during this state withdrawn\r\nforcibly backwards over the glans, and in this situation, while being\r\nitself the first cause of constriction, it induces another--namely, an\r\narrest to the venous circulation, which is followed by a turgescence of\r\nthe glans. In the treatment of such a case, the indication is, first, to\r\nreduce by gradual pressure the size of the glans, so that the prepuce\r\nmay be replaced over it; secondly, to lessen the inflammation by the\r\nordinary means.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 57, exhibits the form of a gonorrhoeal phymosis. The\r\norifice of the prepuce is contracted, and the tissue of it infiltrated.\r\nIf in this state of the part, consequent upon diseased action, or in\r\nthat of Fig. 1, which is congenital, the foreskin be retracted over the\r\nglans, a paraphymosis, like Fig. 2, will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4, Plate 57, shows a form of phymosis in which the prepuce during\r\ninflammation has become adherent to the whole surface of the glans. The\r\norifice of the prepuce being directly opposite the meatus, and the parts\r\noffering no obstruction to the flow of urine, an operation for\r\nseparating the prepuce from the glans would not be required.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5, Plate 57.--In this figure is represented the form of the penis\r\nof an adult, in whom the prepuce was removed by circumcision at an early\r\nage. The membrane covering the glans and the part which is cicatrised\r\nbecomes in these cases dry, indurated, and deprived of its special sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 57.--In this figure the glans appears protruding through\r\nthe upper surface of the prepuce, which is thickened and corrugated.\r\nThis state of the parts was caused by a venereal ulceration of the upper\r\npart of the prepuce, sufficient to allow the glans to press through the\r\naperture. The prepuce in this condition being superfluous, and acting as\r\nan impediment, should be removed by operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 57.--In this figure is shown a condition of the glans and\r\nprepuce resembling that last mentioned, and the effect of a similar\r\ncause. By the removal of the prepuce when in the position here\r\nrepresented, or in that of Fig. 6, the organ may be made to assume the\r\nappearance of Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 8, Plate 57, represents the form of a congenital hypospadias. The\r\ncorpus spongiosum does not continue the canal of the urethra as far\r\nforwards as the usual position of the meatus, but has become defective\r\nbehind the fraenum praeputii, leaving the canal open at this place. In a\r\ncase of this kind an operation on the taliacotian principle might be\r\ntried in order to close the urethra where it presents abnormally patent.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate 57, represents a congenital hypospadias, in which the\r\ncanal of the urethra opens by two distinct apertures along the under\r\nsurface of the corpus spongiosum at the middle line. A probe traverses\r\nboth apertures. In such a case, if the canal of the urethra were\r\nperforate as far forwards as the meatus, and this latter in its normal\r\nposition, the two false openings should be closed by an operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 10, Plate 57.--The urethra is here represented as having a false\r\nopening on its under surface behind the fraenum. The perforation was\r\ncaused by a venereal ulcer. The meatus and urethra anterior to the false\r\naperture remained perforate. Part of a bougie appears traversing the\r\nfalse opening and the meatus. In this state of the organ an attempt\r\nshould be made to close the false aperture permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 11, Plate 57, shows a state of the urethra similar to that of Fig.\r\n10, and the effect of the same cause. Part of a bougie is seen\r\ntraversing the false aperture from the meatus before to the urethra\r\nbehind. In this case, as the whole substance of the corpus spongiosum\r\nwas destroyed for half an inch in extent, the taliacotian operation, by\r\nwhich lost quantity is supplied, is the measure most likely to succeed\r\nin closing the canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 11\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 12, Plate 57.--Behind the meatus, and on the right of the fraenum,\r\nis represented a perforation in the urethra, caused by a venereal ulcer.\r\nThe meatus and the false opening have approached by the contraction of\r\nthe cicatrix; in consequence of which, also, the apex of the glans is\r\ndistorted towards the urethra; a bougie introduced by the meatus\r\noccupies the urethral canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 13, Plate 57.--In this figure the canal of the urethra appears\r\nturning upwards and opening at the median line behind the corona\r\nglandis. This state of the urethra was caused by a venereal ulcer\r\npenetrating the canal from the dorsum of the penis. The proper direction\r\nof the canal might be restored by obliterating the false passage,\r\nprovided the urethra remained perforate in the direction of the meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 13.\r\n\r\nFig. 14, Plate 57, exhibits the form of a congenital epispadias, in\r\nwhich the urethra is seen to open on the dorsal surface of the prepuce\r\nat the median line. The glans appears cleft and deformed. The meatus is\r\ndeficient at its usual place. The prepuce at the dorsum is in part\r\ndeficient, and bound to the glans around the abnormal orifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 14.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 15, Plate 57, represents in section a state of the parts in which\r\nthe urethra opened externally by one fistulous aperture, a, behind the\r\nscrotum; and by another, b, in front of the scrotum. At the latter place\r\nthe canal beneath the penis became imperforate for an inch in extent.\r\nParts of catheters are seen to enter the urethra through the fistulous\r\nopenings a b; and another instrument, c, is seen to pass by the proper\r\nmeatus into the urethra as far as the point where this portion of the\r\ncanal fails to communicate with the other. The under part of the scrotum\r\npresents a cleft corresponding with the situation of the scrotal septum.\r\nThis state of the urinary passage may be the effect either of congenital\r\ndeficiency or of disease. When caused by disease, the chief features in\r\nits history, taking these in the order of their occurrence, are, 1st, a\r\nstricture in the anterior part of the urethra; 2ndly, a rupture of this\r\ncanal behind the stricture; 3rdly, the formation (on an abscess opening\r\nexternally) of a fistulous communication between the canal and the\r\nsurface of some part of the perinaeum; 4thly, the habitual escape of the\r\nurine by the false aperture;  5thly, the obliteration of the canal to a\r\ngreater or less extent anterior to the stricture; 6thly, the parts\r\nsituated near the urethral fistula become so consolidated and confused\r\nthat it is difficult in some and impossible in many cases to find the\r\nsituation of the urethra, either by external examination or by means of\r\nthe catheter passed into the canal. The original seat of the stricture\r\nbecomes so masked by the surrounding disease, and the stricture itself,\r\neven if found by any chance, is generally of so impassable a kind, that\r\nit must be confessed there are few operations in surgery more irksome to\r\na looker-on than is the fruitless effort made, in such a state of the\r\nparts, by a hand without a guide, to pass perforce a blunt pointed\r\ninstrument like a catheter into the bladder. In some instances the\r\nstricture is slightly pervious, the urine passing in small quantity by\r\nthe meatus. In others, the stricture is rendered wholly imperforate, and\r\nthe canal either contracted or nearly obliterated anteriorly through\r\ndisuse. Of these two conditions, the first is that in which catheterism\r\nmay be tried with any reasonable hope of passing the instrument into the\r\nbladder. In the latter state, catheterism is useless, and the only means\r\nwhereby the urethra may be rendered pervious in the proper direction is\r\nthat of incising the stricture from the perinaeum, and after passing a\r\ncatheter across the divided part into the bladder, to retain the\r\ninstrument in this situation till the wound and the fistulae heal and\r\nclose under the treatment proper for this end. (Mr. Syme.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 57.--Figure 15.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 58.--In this figure the urethra appears communicating with\r\na sac like a scrotum. A bougie is represented entering by the meatus,\r\ntraversing the upper part of the sac, and passing into the membranous\r\npart of the urethra beyond. This case which was owing to a congenital\r\nmalformation of the urethra, exhibits a dilatation of the canal such as\r\nmight be produced behind a stricture wherever situated. The urine\r\nimpelled forcibly by the whole action of the abdominal muscles against\r\nthe obstructing part dilates the urethra behind the stricture, and by a\r\nrepetition of such force the part gradually yields more and more, till\r\nit attains a very large size, and protrudes at the perinaeum as a\r\ndistinct fluctuating tumour, every time that an effort is made to void\r\nthe bladder. If the stricture in such a case happen to cause a complete\r\nretention of urine, and that a catheter cannot be passed into the\r\nbladder, the tumour should be punctured prior to taking measures for the\r\nremoval of the stricture. (Sir B. Brodie.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 58, represents two close strictures of the urethra, one of\r\nwhich is situated at the bulb, and the other at the adjoining membranous\r\npart. These are the two situations in which strictures of the organic\r\nkind are said most frequently to occur, (Hunter, Home, Cooper, Brodie,\r\nPhillips, Velpeau.) False passages likewise are mentioned as more liable\r\nto be made in these places than elsewhere in the urethral canal. These\r\noccurrences--the disease and the accident--would seem to follow each\r\nother closely, like cause and consequence. The frequency with which\r\nfalse passages occur in this situation appears to me to be chiefly owing\r\nto the anatomical fact, that the urethra at and close to the bulb is the\r\nmost dependent part of the curve, F K, Fig. 1, Plate 56; and hence, that\r\ninstruments descending to this part from before push forcibly against\r\nthe urethra, and are more apt to protrude through it than to have their\r\npoints turned so as to ascend the curve towards the neck of the bladder.\r\nIf it be also true that strictures happen here more frequently than\r\nelsewhere, this circumstance will of course favour the accident. An\r\nadditional cause why the catheter happens to be frequently arrested at\r\nthis situation and to perforate the canal, is owing to the fact, that\r\nthe triangular ligament is liable to oppose it, the urethral opening in\r\nthis structure not happening to coincide with the direction of the point\r\nof the instrument. In the figure, part of a bougie traverses the urethra\r\nthrough both strictures and lodges upon the enlarged prostate. Another\r\ninstrument, after entering the first stricture, occupies a false passage\r\nwhich was made in the canal between the two constricted parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 58.--A calculus is here represented lodging in the urethra\r\nat the bulb. The walls of the urethra around the calculus appear\r\nthickened. Behind the obstructing body the canal has become dilated,\r\nand, in front of it, contracted. In some instances the calculus presents\r\na perforation through its centre, by which the urine escapes. In others,\r\nthe urine makes its exit between the calculus and the side of the\r\nurethra, which it dilates. In this latter way the foreign body becomes\r\nloosened in the canal and gradually pushed forwards as far as the\r\nmeatus, within which, owing to the narrowness of this aperture, it\r\nlodges permanently. If the calculus forms a complete obstruction to the\r\npassage of the urine, and its removal cannot be effected by other means,\r\nan incision should be made to effect this object.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4, Plate 58, represents the neck of the bladder and neighbouring\r\npart of the urethra of an ox, in which a polypous growth is seen\r\nattached by a long pedicle to the veru montanum and blocking up the neck\r\nof the bladder. Small irregular tubercles of organized lymph, and\r\ntumours formed by the lacunae distended by their own secretion, their\r\norifices being closed by inflammation, are also found to obstruct the\r\nurethral canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5, Plate 58.--In this figure is represented a small calculus\r\nimpacted in and dilating the membranous part of the urethra.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 58.--Two strictures are here shown to exist in the\r\nurethra, one of which is situated immediately in front of the bulb, and\r\nthe other at a point midway between the bulb and the meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 58.--A stricture is here shown situated at the bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 8, Plate 58, represents a stricture of the canal in front of the bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate 58, represents the form of an old callous stricture half\r\nan inch long, situated midway between the bulb and the meatus. This is\r\nperhaps the most common site in which a stricture of this kind is found\r\nto exist. In some instances of old neglected cases the corpus spongiosum\r\nappears converted into a thick gristly cartilaginous mass, several\r\ninches in extent, the passage here being very much contracted, and\r\nchiefly so at the middle of the stricture. When it becomes impossible to\r\ndilate or pass the canal of such a stricture by the ordinary means, it\r\nis recommended to divide the part by the lancetted stilette. (Stafford.)\r\nDivision of the stricture, by any means, is no doubt the readiest and\r\nmost effectual measure that can be adopted, provided we know clearly\r\nthat the cutting instrument engages fairly the part to be divided. But\r\nthis is a knowledge less likely to be attained if the stricture be\r\nsituated behind than in front of the triangular ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 10, Plate 58, exhibits a lateral view of the muscular parts which\r\nsurround the membranous portion of the urethra and the prostate; a, the\r\nmembranous urethra embraced by the compressor urethrae muscle; b, the\r\nlevator prostatae muscle; c, the prostate; d, the anterior ligament of\r\nthe bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 10.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 11, Plate 58.--A posterior view of the parts seen in Fig. 10; a,\r\nthe urethra divided in front of the prostate; b b, the levator prostatae\r\nmuscle; c c, the compressor urethrae; d d, parts of the obturator\r\nmuscles; e e, the anterior fibres of the levator ani muscle; f g, the\r\ntriangular ligament enclosing between its layers the artery of the bulb,\r\nCowper's glands, the membranous urethra, and the muscular parts\r\nsurrounding this portion of the canal. The fact that the flow of urine\r\nthrough the urethra happens occasionally to be suddenly arrested, and\r\nthis circumstance contrasted with the opposite fact that the organic\r\nstricture is of slow formation, originated the idea that the former\r\noccurrence arose from a spasmodic muscular contraction. By many this\r\nspasm was supposed to be due to the urethra being itself muscular. By\r\nothers, it was demonstrated as being dependent upon the muscles which\r\nsurround the membranous part of the urethra, and which act upon this\r\npart and constrict it. From my own observations I have formed the\r\nsettled opinion that the urethra itself is not muscular. And though, on\r\nthe one hand, I believe that this canal, per se, never causes by active\r\ncontraction the spasmodic form of stricture, I am far from supposing, on\r\nthe other, that all sudden arrests to the passage of urine through the\r\nurethra are solely attributable to spasm of the muscles which embrace\r\nthis canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 58.--Figure 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 59 & 60.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIOUS FORMS AND POSITIONS OF STRICTURES AND OTHER\r\nOBSTRUCTIONS OF THE URETHRA.--FALSE PASSAGES.--ENLARGEMENTS\r\nAND DEFORMITIES OF THE PROSTATE.\r\n\r\nImpediments to the passage of the urine through the urethra may arise\r\nfrom different causes, such as the impaction of a small calculus in the\r\ncanal, or any morbid growth (a polypus, &c.) being situated therein, or\r\nfrom an abscess which, though forming externally to the urethra, may\r\npress upon this tube so as either to obstruct it partially, by bending\r\none of its sides towards the other, or completely, by surrounding the\r\ncanal on all sides. These causes of obstruction may happen in any part\r\nof the urethra, but there are two others (the prostatic and the\r\nspasmodic) which are, owing to anatomical circumstances, necessarily\r\nconfined to the posterior two-thirds of the urethra. The portion of the\r\nurethra surrounded by the prostate can alone be obstructed by this body\r\nwhen it has become irregularly enlarged, while the spasmodic stricture\r\ncan only happen to the membranous portion of the urethra, and to an inch\r\nor two of the canal anterior to the bulb, these being the parts which\r\nare embraced by muscular structures. The urethra itself not being\r\nmuscular, cannot give rise to the spasmodic form of stricture. But that\r\nkind of obstruction which is common to all parts of the urethra, and\r\nwhich is dependent, as well upon the structures of which the canal is\r\nuniformly composed, as upon the circumstance that inflammation may\r\nattack these in any situation and produce the same effect, is the\r\npermanent or organic stricture. Of this disease the forms are as various\r\nas the situations are, for as certainly as it may reasonably be supposed\r\nthat the plastic lymph, effused in an inflamed state of the urethra from\r\nany cause, does not give rise to stricture of any special or particular\r\nform, exclusive of all others; so as certainly may it be inferred that,\r\nin a structurally uniform canal, inflammation points to no one\r\nparticular place of it, whereat by preference to establish the organic\r\nstricture. The membranous part of the canal is, however, mentioned as\r\nbeing the situation most prone to the disease; but I have little doubt,\r\nnevertheless, that owing to general rules of this kind being taken for\r\ngranted, upon imposing authority, many more serious evils (false\r\npassages, &c.) have been effected by catheterism than existed previous\r\nto the performance of this operation.[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Home describes \"a natural constriction of the urethra,\r\ndirectly behind the bulb, which is probably formed with a power of\r\ncontraction to prevent,\" &c. This is the part which he says is \"most\r\nliable to the disease of stricture.\" (Strictures of the Urethra.) Now,\r\nif anyone, even among the acute observing microscopists, can discern the\r\nstructure to which Home alludes, he will certainly prove this anatomist\r\nto be a marked exception amongst those who, for the enforcement of any\r\ndoctrine, can see any thing or phenomenon they wish to see. And, if\r\nHunter were as the mirror from which Home's mind was reflected, then the\r\nobservation must be imputed to the Great Original. Upon the question,\r\nhowever, as to which is the most frequent seat of stricture, I find that\r\nboth these anatomists do not agree, Hunter stating that its usual seat\r\nis just in front of the bulb, while Home regrets, as it were, to be\r\nobliged to differ from \"his immortal friend,\" and avers its seat to be\r\nan infinitesimal degree behind the bulb. Sir A. Cooper again, though\r\narguing that the most usual situation of stricture is that mentioned by\r\nHunter, names, as next in order of frequency, strictures of the\r\nmembranous and prostatic parts of the urethra. Does it not appear\r\nstrange now, how questions of this import should have occupied so much\r\nof the serious attention of our great predecessors, and of those, too,\r\nwho at the present time form the vanguard of the ranks of science? Upon\r\nwhat circumstance, either anatomical or pathological, can one part of\r\nthe urethra be more liable to the organic stricture than another?]\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 and 2, Plate 59.--In these figures are presented seven forms of\r\norganic stricture occurring, in different parts of the urethra. In a,\r\nFig. 1, the mucous membrane is thrown into a sharp circular fold, in the\r\ncentre of which the canal, appears much contracted; a section of this\r\nstricture appears in b, Fig. 2. In b, Fig. 1, the canal is contracted\r\nlaterally by a prominent fold of the mucous membrane at the opposite\r\nside. In c, Fig. 1, an organized band of lymph is stretched across the\r\ncanal; this stricture is seen in section in c, Fig. 2. In e, Fig. 1, a\r\nstellate band of organized lymph, attached by pedicles to three sides of\r\nthe urethra, divides the canal into three passages. In d, Fig. 1, the\r\ncanal is seen to be much contracted towards the left side by a\r\ncrescentic fold of the lining membrane projecting from the right. In f,\r\nthe canal appears contracted by a circular membrane, perforated in the\r\ncentre; a section of which is seen at a, Fig. 2. The form of the organic\r\nstricture varies therefore according to the three following\r\ncircumstances:--1st. When lymph becomes effused within the canal upon\r\nthe surface of the lining mucous membrane, and contracts adhesions\r\nacross the canal. 2ndly. When lymph is effused external to the lining\r\nmembrane, and projects this inwards, thereby narrowing the diameter of\r\nthe canal. 3rdly. When the outer and inner walls of a part of the\r\nurethra are involved in the effused organizable matter, and on\r\ncontracting towards each other, encroach at the same time upon the area\r\nof the canal. This latter state presents the form, which is known as the\r\nold callous tough stricture, extending in many instances for an inch or\r\nmore along the canal. In cases where the urethra becomes obstructed by\r\ntough bands of substance, c e, which cross the canal directly, the\r\npoints of flexible catheters, especially if these be of slender shape,\r\nare apt to be bent upon the resisting part, and on pressure being\r\ncontinued, the operator may be led to suppose that the instrument\r\ntraverses the stricture, while it is most probably perforating the wall\r\nof the urethra. But in those cases where the diameter of the canal is\r\ncircularly contracted, the stricture generally presents a conical\r\ndepression in front, which, receiving the point of the instrument,\r\nallows this to enter the central passage unerringly. A stricture formed\r\nby a crescentic septum, such as is seen in b d, Fig. 1, offers a more\r\neffectual obstacle to the passage of a catheter than the circular septum\r\nlike a f.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 1, Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 59.--In this there are seen three separate strictures, a,\r\nb, c, situated in the urethra, anterior to the bulb. In some cases there\r\nare many more strictures (even to the number of six or seven) situated\r\nin various parts of the urethra; and it is observed that when one\r\nstricture exists, other slight tightnesses in different parts of the\r\ncanal frequently attend it. (Hunter.) When several strictures occur in\r\nvarious parts of the urethra, they may occasion as much difficulty in\r\npassing an instrument as if the whole canal between the extreme\r\nconstrictions were uniformly narrowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4, Plate 59.--In this the canal is constricted at the point a,\r\nmidway between the bulb and glans. A false passage has been made under\r\nthe urethra by an instrument which passed out of the canal at the point\r\nf, anterior to the stricture a, and re-entered the canal at the point c,\r\nanterior to the bulb. When a false passage of this kind happens to be\r\nmade, it will become a permanent outlet for the urine, so long as the\r\nstricture remains. For it can be of no avail that we avoid re-opening\r\nthe anterior perforation by the catheter, so long as the urine prevented\r\nfrom flowing by the natural canal enters the posterior perforation.\r\nMeasures should be at once taken to remove the stricture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 4.\r\n\r\nFig. 5, Plate 59.--The stricture a appears midway between the bulb and\r\nglans, the area of the passage through the stricture being sufficient\r\nonly to admit a bristle to pass. It would seem almost impossible to pass\r\na catheter through a stricture so close as this, unless by a laceration\r\nof the part, combined with dilatation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 59.--Two instruments, a, b, have made false passages\r\nbeneath the mucous membrane, in a case where no stricture at all\r\nexisted. The resistance which the instruments encountered in passing out\r\nof the canal having been mistaken, no doubt, for that of passing through\r\na close stricture.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 59.--A bougie, b b, is seen to perforate the urethra\r\nanterior to the stricture c, situated an inch behind the glans, and\r\nafter traversing the substance of the right corpus cavernosum d, for its\r\nwhole length, re-enters the neck of the bladder through the body of the\r\nprostate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 8, Plate 59.--A bougie, c c, appears tearing and passing beneath\r\nthe lining membrane, d d, of the prostatic urethra. It is remarked that\r\nthe origin of a false passage is in general anterior to the stricture.\r\nIt may, however, occur at any part of the canal in which no stricture\r\nexists, if the hand that impels the instrument be not guided by a true\r\nknowledge of the form of the urethra; and perhaps the accident happening\r\nfrom this cause is the more general rule of the two.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate 59.--Two strictures are represented here, the one, e,\r\nclose to the bulb d, the other, f, an inch anterior to this part. In the\r\nprostate, a b, are seen irregularly shaped abscess pits, communicating\r\nwith each other, and projecting upwards the floor of this body to such a\r\ndegree, that the prostatic canal appears nearly obliterated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 9.\r\n\r\nFig. 10, Plate 59.--Two bougies, d e, are seen to enter the upper wall\r\nof the urethra, c, anterior to the prostate, a b. This accident happens\r\nwhen the handle of a rigid instrument is depressed too soon, with the\r\nobject of raising its point over the enlarged third lobe of the\r\nprostate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 10.\r\n\r\nFig. 11, Plate 59.--Two instruments appear transfixing the prostate, of\r\nwhich body the three lobes, a, b, c, are much enlarged. The instrument d\r\nperforates the third lobe, a; while the instrument e penetrates the\r\nright lobe, c, and the third lobe, a. This accident occurs when\r\ninstruments not possessing the proper prostatic bend are forcibly pushed\r\nforwards against the resistance at the neck of the bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 12, Plate 59.--In this case an instrument, d d, after passing\r\nbeneath part of the lining membrane, e e, anterior to the bulb,\r\npenetrates b, the right lobe of the prostate. A second instrument, c c,\r\npenetrates the left lobe. A third smaller instrument, f f, is seen to\r\npass out of the urethra anterior to the prostate, and after transfixing\r\nthe right vesicula seminalis external to the neck of the bladder, enters\r\nthis viscus at a point behind the prostate. The resistance which the two\r\nlarger instruments met with in penetrating the prostate, made it seem,\r\nperhaps, that a tight stricture existed in this situation, to match\r\nwhich the smaller instrument, f f, was afterwards passed in the course\r\nmarked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 59.--Figure 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nFigs. 1 to 5, Plate 60, represent a series of prostates, in which the\r\nthird lobe gradually increases in size. In Fig. 1, which shows the\r\nhealthy state of the neck of the bladder, unmarked by the prominent\r\nlines which are said to bound the space named \"trigone vesical,\" or by\r\nthose which indicate the position of the \"muscles of the ureters,\" the\r\nthird lobe does not exist. In Fig. 2 it appears as the uvula vesicae, a.\r\nIn Fig. 3 the part a is increased, and under the name now of third lobe\r\nis seen to contract and bend upwards the prostatic canal. In Fig. 4 the\r\neffect which the growth of the lobe, a, produces upon the form of the\r\nneck of the bladder becomes more marked, and the part presenting\r\nperforations, e e, produced by instruments, indicates that by its shape\r\nit became an obstacle to the egress of the urine as well as to the\r\nentrance of instruments. A calculus of irregular form is seen to lodge\r\nbehind the third lobe, and to be out of the reach of the point of a\r\nsound, supposing this to enter the bladder over the apex of the lobe. In\r\nFig. 5 the three lobes are enlarged, but the third is most so, and while\r\nstanding on a narrow pedicle attached to the floor of the prostate,\r\ncompletely blocks up the neck of the bladder. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 60.--Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: On comparing this series of figures, it must appear that the\r\nthird lobe of the prostate is the product of diseased action,  in so far\r\nat least as an unnatural hypertrophy of a part may be so designated. It\r\nis not proper to the bladder in the healthy state of this organ, and\r\nwhere it does manifest itself by increase it performs no healthy\r\nfunction in the economy. When Home, therefore, described this part as a\r\nnew fact in anatomy, he had in reality as little reason for so doing as\r\nhe would have had in naming any other tumour, a thing unknown to normal\r\nanatomy. Langenbeck (Neue Bibl. b. i. p. 360) denies its existence in\r\nthe healthy state. Cruveilhier (Anat. Pathog. liv. xxvii.) deems it\r\nincorrect to reckon a third lobe as proper to the healthy bladder.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 60.--The prostatic canal is bent upwards by the enlarged\r\nthird lobe to such a degree as to form a right angle with the membranous\r\npart of the canal. A bougie is seen to perforate the third lobe, and\r\nthis is the most frequent mode in which, under such circumstances, and\r\nwith instruments of the usual imperfect form, access may be gained to\r\nthe bladder for the relief of retention of urine. \"The new passage may\r\nin every respect be as efficient as one formed by puncture or incision\r\nin any other way.\" (Fergusson.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 60.--Figure 6\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 60.--The three lobes of the prostate, a, b, c, are equally\r\nenlarged. The prostatic canal is consequently much contracted and\r\ndistorted, so that an instrument on being passed into the bladder has\r\nmade a false passage through the third lobe. When a catheter is\r\nsuspected to have entered the bladder by perforating the prostate, the\r\ninstrument should be retained in the newly made passage till such time\r\nas this has assumed the cylindrical form of the instrument. If this be\r\ndone, the new passage will be the more likely to become permanent. It is\r\nascertained that all false passages and fistulae by which the urine\r\nescapes, become after a time lined with a membrane similar to that of\r\nthe urethra.

The third lobe, a a, projecting from below,\r\ndistorts the prostatic canal upwards and to the right side.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 60.--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate 60.--The right lobe, a c c, of the prostate appears\r\nhollowed out so as to form the sac of an abscess which, by its\r\nprojection behind, pressed upon the forepart of the rectum, and by its\r\nprojection in front, contracted the area of the prostatic canal, and\r\nthereby caused an obstruction in this part. Not unfrequently when a\r\ncatheter is passed along the urethra, for the relief of a retention of\r\nurine caused by the swell of an abscess in this situation, the sac\r\nbecomes penetrated by the instrument, and, instead of urine, pus flows.\r\nThe sac of a prostatic abscess frequently opens of its own accord into\r\nthe neighbouring part of the urethra, and when this occurs it becomes\r\nnecessary to retain a catheter in the neck of the bladder, so as to\r\nprevent the urine entering the sac.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 60.--Figure 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 10, Plate 60.--The prostate presents four lobes of equal size, and\r\nall projecting largely around the neck of the bladder.

The catheter, d, occupying the canal lies\r\nnearly straight. The lower wall, c, of the prostate is much diminished\r\nin thickness. A nipple-shaped process, a, is seen to be attached by a\r\npedicle to the back of the upper part, b, of the prostate, and to act\r\nlike a stopper to the neck of the bladder. The body a being moveable, it\r\nwill be perceived how, while the bladder is distended with urine, the\r\npressure from above may block up the neck of the organ with this part,\r\nand thus cause complete retention, which, on the introduction of a\r\ncatheter, becomes readily relieved by the instrument pushing the\r\nobstructing body aside.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 60.--Figure 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 61 & 62.\r\n\r\nDEFORMITIES OF THE PROSTATE.--DISTORTIONS AND\r\nOBSTRUCTIONS OF THE PROSTATIC URETHRA.\r\n\r\nThe prostate is liable to such frequent and varied deformities, the\r\nconsequence of diseased action, whilst, at the same time, its healthy\r\nfunction (if it have any) in the male body is unknown, that it admits at\r\nleast of one interpretation which may, according to fact, be given of\r\nit--namely, that of playing a principal part in effecting some of the\r\nmost distressing of \"the thousand natural ills that flesh is heir to.\"\r\nBut heedless of such a singular explanation of a final cause, the\r\npractical surgeon will readily confess the fitting application of the\r\ninterpretation, such as it is, and rest contented with the proximate\r\nfacts and proofs. As physiologists, however, it behooves us to look\r\nfurther into nature, and search for the ultimate fact in her prime\r\nmoving law. The prostate is peculiar to the male body, the uterus to the\r\nfemale. With the exception of these two organs there is not another\r\nwhich appears in the one sex but has its analogue in the opposite sex;\r\nand thus these two organs, the prostate and the uterus, appear by\r\nexclusion of the rest to approach the test of comparison, by which their\r\nanalogy becomes as fully manifested as that between the two quantities,\r\na-b, and a+b the only difference which exists depends upon the\r\nsubtraction or the addition of the quantity, b. The difference between a\r\nprostate and a uterus is simply one of quantity, such as we see existing\r\nbetween the male and the female breast. The prostate is to the uterus\r\nabsolutely what a rudimentary organ is to its fully developed analogue.\r\nThe one, as being superfluous, is in accordance with nature's law of\r\nnihil supervacaneum nihil frutra, arrested in its development, and in\r\nsuch a character appears the prostate. This body is not a gland any more\r\nthan is the uterus, but both organs being quantitatively, and hence\r\nfunctionally different, I here once more venture to call down an\r\ninterpretation of the part from the unfrequented bourne of comparative\r\nanatomy, and turning it to lend an interest to the accompanying figures\r\neven with a surgical bearing, I remark that the prostatic or rudimentary\r\nuterus, like a germ not wholly blighted, is prone to an occasional\r\nsprouting or increase beyond its prescribed dimensions--a hypertrophy in\r\nbarren imitation, as it were, of gestation. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote: This expression of the fact to which I allude will not, I\r\ntrust, be extended beyond the limits I assign to it. Though I have every\r\nreason to believe, that between the prostate of the male and the uterus\r\nof the female, the same amount of analogy exists, as between a coccygeal\r\nossicle and the complete vertebral form elsewhere situated in the spinal\r\nseries, I am as far from regarding the two former to be in all respects\r\nstructurally or functionally alike, as I am from entertaining the like\r\nidea in respect to the two latter. But still I maintain that between a\r\nprostate and a uterus, as between a coccygeal bone and a vertebra, the\r\nonly difference which exists is one of quantity, and that hence arises\r\nthe functional difference. A prostate is part of a uterus, just as a\r\ncoccygeal bone is part (the centrum) of a vertebra. That this is the\r\nabsolute signification of the prostate I firmly believe, and were this\r\nthe proper place, I could prove it in detail, by the infallible rule of\r\nanalogical reasoning. John Hunter has observed that the use of the\r\nprostate was not sufficiently known to enable us to form a judgment of\r\nthe bad consequences of its diseased state. When the part becomes\r\nmorbidly enlarged, it acts as a mechanical impediment to the passage of\r\nurine from the bladder, but from this circumstance we cannot reasonably\r\ninfer, that while of its normal healthy proportions, its special\r\nfunction is to facilitate the egress of the urine, for the female\r\nbladder, though wholly devoid of the prostate, performs its own function\r\nperfectly. It appears to me, therefore, that the real question should\r\nbe, not what is the use of the prostate? but has it any proper function?\r\nIf the former question puzzled even the philosophy of Hunter, it was\r\nbecause the latter question must be answered in the negative. The\r\nprostate has no function proper to itself per se. It is a thing distinct\r\nfrom the urinary apparatus, and distinct likewise from the generative\r\norgans. It may be hypertrophied or atrophied, or changed in texture, or\r\nwholly destroyed by abscess, and yet neither of the functions of these\r\ntwo systems of organs will be impaired, if the part while diseased act\r\nnot as an obstruction to them. In texture the prostate is similar to an\r\nunimpregnated uterus. In form it is, like the uterus, symmetrical. In\r\nposition it corresponds to the uterus. The prostate has no ducts proper\r\nto itself. Those ducts which are said to belong to it (prostatic ducts)\r\nare merely mucous cells, similar to those in other parts of the urethral\r\nlining membrane. The seminal ducts evidently do not belong to it. The\r\ntexture of the prostate is not such as appears in glandular bodies\r\ngenerally. In short, the facts which prove what it is not, prove what it\r\nactually is--namely, a uterus arrested in its development, and as a sign\r\nof that all-encompassing law in nature, which science expresses by the\r\nterm \"unity in variety.\" This interpretation of the prostate, which I\r\nbelieve to be true to nature, will last perhaps till such time as the\r\nmicroscopists shall discover in its \"secretion\" some species of\r\nmannikins, such as may pair with those which they term spermatozoa.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 61.--The prostate, a b, is here represented thinned in its\r\nwalls above and below. The lower wall is dilated into a pouch caused by\r\nthe points of misdirected instruments in catheterism having been rashly\r\nforced against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 61.--The prostate, a b, is here seen to be somewhat more\r\nenlarged than is natural. A tubercle, b, surmounts the lower part, c, of\r\nthe prostate, and blocks up the vesical orifice. Catheters introduced by\r\nthe urethra for retention of urine which existed in this case, have had\r\ntheir points arrested at the bulb, and on being pushed forwards in this\r\ndirection, have dilated the bulb into the form of a pouch, seen at d.\r\nThe sinus of the bulb, being the lowest part of the urethral canal, is\r\nvery liable to be distorted or perforated by the points of instruments\r\ndescending upon it from above and before. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: When a stricture exists immediately behind the bulb, this\r\ncircumstance will, of course, favour the occurrence of the accident.\r\n\"False passages (observes Mr. Benjamin Phillips) are less frequent here\r\n(in the membranous part of the urethra) than in the bulbous portion of\r\nthe canal. The reason of this must be immediately evident: false\r\npassages are ordinarily made in consequence of the difficulty\r\nexperienced in the endeavour to pass an instrument through the\r\nstrictured portion of the tube. Stricture is most frequently seated at\r\nthe point of junction between the bulbous and membranous portions of the\r\ncanal; consequently, the false passage will be usually anterior to this\r\nlatter point.\"--(On the Urethra, its Diseases. &c., p. 15.) ]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 2\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 61.--A cyst, c, is seen to grow from the left side of the\r\nbase of the prostate, a b, and to form an obstruction at the vesical\r\norifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 4, Plate 61.--A globular excrescence, a, appears blocking up the\r\nvesical orifice, and giving to this the appearance of a crescentic slit,\r\ncorresponding to the shape of the obstructing body. The prostate, b b,\r\nis enlarged in both its lateral lobes. A small bougie, c, is placed in\r\nthe prostatic canal and vesical opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 4\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5, Plate 61.--The prostate, d, is considerably enlarged, and the\r\nvesical orifice is girt by a prominent ring, b b, from the right border\r\nof which the nipple-shaped body, a, projects and occupies the outlet.\r\nOwing to the retention of urine caused by this state of the prostate,\r\nthe ureters, c c, have become very much dilated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes of the prostate, c c, are seen\r\nenlarged, and from the inner side and base of each, irregularly shaped\r\nmasses, a, b, d, project, and bend the prostatic urethra first to the\r\nright side, then to the left. The part, a, resting upon the part, b,\r\nacts like a valve against the vesical outlet, which would become closed\r\nthe tighter according to the degree of superincumbent pressure. A\r\nflexible catheter would, in such a case as this, be more likely,\r\nperhaps, to follow the sinuous course of the prostatic passage than a\r\nrigid instrument of metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 6.\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 61.--A globular mass, a, of large size, occupies the neck\r\nof the bladder, and gives the vesical orifice, c, a crescentic shape,\r\nconvex towards the right side. The two lobes of the prostate, b, are\r\nmuch enlarged.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 7.\r\n\r\nFig. 8, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes, b b, of the prostate are\r\nirregularly enlarged, and the urinary passage is bent towards the right\r\nside, c, from the membranous portion, which is central. Surmounting the\r\nvesical orifice, c, is seen the tuberculated mass, a, which being\r\nmoveable, can be forced against the vesical orifice and thus produce\r\ncomplete retention of urine. In this case, also, a flexible catheter\r\nwould be more suitable than a metallic one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 9, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes, b b, of the prostate are enlarged.\r\nThe third lobe, a, projects at the neck of the bladder, distorting the\r\nvesical outlet. A small calculus occupies the prostatic urethra, and\r\nbeing closely impacted in this part of the canal, would arrest the\r\nprogress of a catheter, and probably lead to the supposition that the\r\ninstrument grated against a stone in the interior of the bladder, in\r\nwhich case it would be inferred that since the urine did not flow\r\nthrough the catheter no retention existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 9, 10.\r\n\r\nFig. 10, Plate 61.--Both lateral lobes, b c, of the prostate appear much\r\nincreased in size. A large irregular shaped mass, a, grows from the base\r\nof the right lobe, and distorts the prostatic canal and vesical orifice.\r\nWhen the lobes of the prostate increase in size in this direction, the\r\nprostatic canal becomes much more elongated than natural, and hence the\r\ninstrument which is to be passed for relieving the existing retention of\r\nurine should have a wide and long curve to correspond with the form of\r\nthis part of the urethra. [Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Both lobes of the prostate are equally liable to chronic\r\nenlargement. Home believed the left lobe to be oftener increased in size\r\nthan the right. Wilson (on the Male Urinary and Genital Organs) mentions\r\nseveral instances of the enlargement of the right lobe. No reason can be\r\nassigned why one lobe should be more prone to hypertrophy than the\r\nother, even supposing it to be matter of fact, which it is not. But the\r\nobservations made by Cruveilhier (Anat. Pathol.), that the lobulated\r\nprojections of the prostate always take place internally at its vesical\r\naspect, is as true as the manner in which he accounts for the fact is\r\nplausible. The dense fibrous envelope of the prostate is sufficient to\r\nrepress its irregular growth externally.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 11, Plate 61.--Both lobes of the prostate are enlarged, and from\r\nthe base of each a mass projects prominently around the vesical orifice,\r\na b. The prostatic urethra has been moulded to the shape of the\r\ninstrument, which was retained in it for a considerable time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 11.\r\n\r\nFig. 12, Plate 61.--The prostate, c b, is enlarged and dilated, like a\r\nsac. Across the neck, a, of the bladder the prostate projects in an\r\narched form, and is transfixed by the instrument, d. The prostate may\r\nassume this appearance, as well from instruments having been forced\r\nagainst it, as from an abscess cavity formed in its substance having\r\nreceived, from time to time, a certain amount of the urine, and retained\r\nthis fluid under the pressure of strong efforts, made to void the\r\nbladder while the vesical orifice was closed above.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 13, Plate 61.--The lateral lobes, d e, of the prostate are\r\nenlarged; and, occupying the position of the third lobe, appear as three\r\nmasses, a b c, plicated upon each other, and directed towards the\r\nvesical orifice, which they close like valves. The prostatic urethra\r\nbranches upwards into three canals, formed by the relative position of\r\nthe parts, e, c, b, a, d, at the neck of the bladder. The ureters are\r\ndilated, in consequence of the regurgitation of the contents of the\r\nbladder during the retention which existed ..\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 61.--Figure 13.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1, Plate 62, exhibits the lobes of the prostate greatly increased\r\nin size. The part, a b, girds irregularly, and obstructs the vesical\r\noutlet, while the lateral lobes, c d, encroach upon the space of the\r\nprostatic canal. The walls of the bladder are much thickened.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 62.--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 62.--The three lobes, a, d, c, of the prostate are\r\nenlarged and of equal size, moulded against each other in such a way\r\nthat the prostatic canal and vesical orifice appear as mere clefts\r\nbetween them. The three lobes are encrusted on their vesical surfaces\r\nwith a thick calcareous deposit. The surface of the third lobe, a, which\r\nhas been half denuded of the calcareous crust, b, in order to show its\r\nreal character, appeared at first to be a stone impacted in the neck of\r\nthe bladder, and of such a nature it certainly would seem to the touch,\r\non striking it with the point of a sound or other instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 62.--Figure 2, 3.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 3, Plate 62, represents the prostate with its three lobes enlarged,\r\nand the prostatic canal and vesical orifice narrowed. The walls of the\r\nbladder are thickened, fasciculated, and sacculated; the two former\r\nappearances being caused by a hypertrophy of the vesical fibres, while\r\nthe latter is in general owing to a protrusion of the mucous membrane\r\nbetween the fasciculi.\r\n\r\nFig. 4, Plate 62.--The prostate presents four lobes, a, b, c, d, each\r\nbeing of large size, and projecting far into the interior of the\r\nbladder, from around the vesical orifice which they obstruct. The\r\nbladder is thickened, and the prostatic canal is elongated. The urethra\r\nand the lobes of the prostate have been perforated by instruments,\r\npassed for the retention of urine which existed. A stricturing band, e,\r\nis seen to cross the membranous part of the canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 62.--Figure 4, 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 5, Plate 62.--The prostate, a a, is greatly enlarged, and projects\r\nhigh in the bladder, the walls of the latter, b b, being very much\r\nthickened. The ureters, c, are dilated, and perforations made by\r\ninstruments are seen in the prostate. The prostatic canal being directed\r\nalmost vertically, and the neck of the bladder being raised nearly as\r\nhigh as the upper border of the pubic symphysis, it must appear that if\r\na stone rest in the bas fond of the bladder, a sound or staff cannot\r\nreach the stone, unless by perforating the prostate; and if, while the\r\nstaff occupies this position, lithotomy be performed, the incisions will\r\nnot be required to be made of a greater depth than if the prostate were\r\nof its ordinary proportions. On the contrary, if the staff happen to\r\nhave surmounted the prostate, the incision, in order to divide the whole\r\nvertical thickness of this body, will require to be made very deeply\r\nfrom the perinaeal surface, and this circumstance occasions what is\r\ntermed a \"deep perinaeum.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 6, Plate 62.--The lower half, c, b, f, of the prostate, having\r\nbecome the seat of abscess, appears hollowed out in the form of a sac.\r\nThis sac is separated from the bladder by a horizontal septum, e e, the\r\nproper base of the bladder, g g. The prostatic urethra, between a e, has\r\nbecome vertical in respect to the membranous part of the canal, in\r\nconsequence of the upward pressure of the abscess. The sac opens into\r\nthe urethra, near the apex of the prostate, at the point c; and a\r\ncatheter passed along the urethra has entered the orifice of the sac,\r\nthe interior of which the instrument traverses, and the posterior wall\r\nof which it perforates. The bladder contains a large calculus, i. The\r\nbladder and sac do not communicate, but the urethra is a canal common to\r\nboth. In a case of this sort it becomes evident that, although symptoms\r\nmay strongly indicate either a retention of urine, or the presence of a\r\nstone in the bladder, any instrument taking the position and direction\r\nof d d, cannot relieve the one or detect the other; and such is the\r\ndirection in which the instrument must of necessity pass, while the sac\r\npresents its orifice more in a line with the membranous part of the\r\nurethra than the neck of the bladder is. The sac will intervene between\r\nthe rectum and the bladder; and on examination of the parts through the\r\nbowel, an instrument in the sac will readily be mistaken for being in\r\nthe bladder, while neither a calculus in the bladder, nor this organ in\r\na state of even extreme distention, can be detected by the touch any\r\nmore than by the sound or catheter. If, while performing lithotomy in\r\nsuch a state of the parts, the staff occupy the situation of d d d, then\r\nthe knife, following the staff, will open, not the bladder which\r\ncontains the stone, but the sac, which, moreover, if it happen to be\r\nfilled with urine regurgigated from the urethra, will render the\r\ndeception more complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 62.--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 7, Plate 62.--The walls, a a, of the bladder, appear greatly\r\nthickened, and the ureters, b, dilated. The sides, c c c, of the\r\nprostate are thinned; and in the prostatic canal are two calculi, d d,\r\nclosely impacted. In such a state of the parts it would be impossible to\r\npass a catheter into the bladder for the relief of a retention of urine,\r\nor to introduce a staff as a guide to the knife in lithotomy. If,\r\nhowever, the staff can be passed as far as the situation of the stone,\r\nthe parts may be held with a sufficient degree of steadiness to enable\r\nthe operator to incise the prostate upon the stone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 62.--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 63 & 64.\r\n\r\nDEFORMITIES OF THE URINARY BLADDER.--THE OPERATIONS OF SOUNDING FOR\r\nSTONE, OF CATHETERISM AND OF PUNCTURING THE BLADDER ABOVE THE PUBES.\r\n\r\nThe urinary bladder presents two kinds of deformity--viz., congenital\r\nand pathological. As examples of the former may be mentioned that in\r\nwhich the organ is deficient in front, and has become everted and\r\nprotruded like a fungous mass through an opening at the median line of\r\nthe hypogastrium; that in which the rectum terminates in the bladder\r\nposteriorly; and that in which the foetal urachus remains pervious as a\r\nuniform canal, or assumes a sacculated shape between the summit of the\r\nbladder and the umbilicus. The pathological deformities are, those in\r\nwhich vesical fistulae, opening either above the pubes, at the\r\nperinaeum, or into the rectum, have followed abscesses or the operation\r\nof puncturing the bladder in these situations, and those in which the\r\nwalls of the organ appear thickened and contracted, or thinned and\r\nexpanded, or sacculated externally, or ridged internally, in consequence\r\nof its having been subjected to abdominal pressure while overdistended\r\nwith its contents, and while incapable of voiding these from some\r\npermanent obstruction in the urethral canal.[Footnote] The bladder is\r\nliable to become sacculated from two causes--from a hernial protrusion\r\nof its mucous membrane through the separated fasciculi of its fibrous\r\ncoat, or from the cyst of an abscess which has formed a communication\r\nwith the bladder, and received the contents of this organ. Sacs, when\r\nproduced in the former way, may be of any number, or size, or in any\r\nsituation; when caused by an abscess, the sac is single, is generally\r\nformed in the prostate, or corresponds to the base of the bladder, and\r\nmay attain to a size equalling, or even exceeding, that of the bladder\r\nitself. The sac, however formed, will be found lined by mucous membrane.\r\nThe cyst of an abscess, when become a recipient for the urine, assumes\r\nafter a time a lining membrane similar to that of the bladder. If the\r\nsac be situated at the summit or back of the bladder, it will be found\r\ninvested by peritonaeum; but, whatever be its size, structure, or\r\nposition, it may be always distinguished from the bladder by being\r\ndevoid of the fibrous tunic, and by having but an indirect relation to\r\nthe vesical orifice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: On considering these cases of physical impediments to the\r\npassage of urine from the vesical reservoir through the urethral\r\nconduit, it seems to me as if these were sufficient to account for the\r\nformation of stone in the bladder, or any other part of the urinary\r\napparatus, without the necessity of ascribing it to a constitutional\r\ndisease, such as that named the lithic diathesis by the humoral\r\npathologists.\r\n\r\nThe urinary apparatus (consisting of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and\r\nurethra) is known to be the principal emunctory for eliminating and\r\nvoiding the detritus formed by the continual decay of the parts\r\ncomprising the animal economy. The urine is this detritus in a state of\r\nsolution. The components of urine are chemically similar to those of\r\ncalculi, and as the components of the one vary according to the\r\ndisintegration occurring at the time in the vital alembic, so do those\r\nof the other. While, therefore, a calculus is only as urine precipitated\r\nand solidified, and this fluid only as calculous matter suspended in a\r\nmenstruum, it must appear that the lithic diathesis is as natural and\r\nuniversal as structural disintegration is constant and general in\r\noperation. As every individual, therefore, may be said to void day by\r\nday a dissolved calculus, it must follow that its form of precipitation\r\nwithin some part of the urinary apparatus alone constitutes the disease,\r\nsince in this form it cannot be passed. On viewing the subject in this\r\nlight, the question that springs directly is, (while the lithic\r\ndiathesis is common to individuals of all ages and both sexes,) why the\r\nlithic sediment should present in the form of concrement in some and not\r\nin others? The principal, if not the sole, cause of this seems to me to\r\nbe obstruction to the free egress of the urine along the natural\r\npassage. Aged individuals of the male sex, in whom the prostate is prone\r\nto enlargement, and the urethra to organic stricture, are hence more\r\nsubject to the formation of stone in the bladder, than youths, in whom\r\nthese causes of obstruction are less frequent, or than females of any\r\nage, in whom the prostate is absent, and the urethra simple, short,\r\nreadily dilatable, and seldom or never strictured. When an obstruction\r\nexists, lithic concretions take place in the urinary apparatus in the\r\nsame manner as sedimentary particles cohere or crystallize elsewhere.\r\nThe urine becoming pent up and stagnant while charged with saline\r\nmatter, either deposits this around a nucleus introduced into it, or as\r\na surplus when the menstruum is insufficient to suspend it. The most\r\ndepending part of the bladder is that where lithic concretions take\r\nplace; and if a sacculus exist here, this, becoming a recipient for the\r\nmatter, will favour the formation of stone.] [End Footnote]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 1, Plate 63.--The lateral lobes of the prostate, 3, 4, are\r\nenlarged, and contract the prostatic canal. Behind them the third lobe\r\nof smaller size occupies the vesical orifice, and completes the\r\nobstruction. The walls of the bladder have hence become fasciculated and\r\nsacculated. One sac, 1, projects from the summit of the bladder;\r\nanother, 2, containing a stone, projects laterally. When a stone\r\noccupies a sac, it does not give rise to the usual symptoms as\r\nindicating its presence, nor can it be always detected by the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 2, Plate 63.--The prostate, 2, 3, is enlarged, and the middle lobe,\r\n2, appears bending the prostatic canal to an almost vertical position,\r\nand obstructing the vesical orifice. The bladder, 1, 1, 1, is thickened;\r\nthe ureters, 7, are dilated; and a large sac, 6, 6, projects from the\r\nbase of the bladder backwards, and occupies the recto-vesical fossa. The\r\nsac, equal in size to the bladder, communicates with this organ by a\r\nsmall circular opening, 8, situated between the orifices of the ureters.\r\nThe peritonaeum is reflected from the summit of the bladder to that of\r\nthe sac. A catheter, 4, appears perforating the third lobe of the\r\nprostate, 2, and entering the sac, 5, through the base of the bladder,\r\nbelow the opening, 8. In a case of this kind, a catheter occupying the\r\nposition 4, 5, would, while voiding the bladder through the sac, make it\r\nseem as if it really traversed the vesical orifice. If a stone occupied\r\nthe bladder, the point of the instrument in the sac could not detect it,\r\nwhereas, if a stone lay within the sac, the instrument, on striking it\r\nhere, would give the impression as if it lay within the bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 3, Plate 63.--The urethra being strictured, the bladder has become\r\nsacculated. In the bas fond of the bladder appears a circular opening,\r\n2, leading to a sac of large dimensions, which rested against the\r\nrectum. In such a case as this, the sac, occupying a lower position than\r\nthe base of the bladder, must first become the recipient of the urine,\r\nand retain this fluid even after the bladder has been evacuated, either\r\nvoluntarily or by means of instruments. If, in such a state of the\r\nparts, retention of urine called for puncturation, it is evident that\r\nthis operation would be performed with greater effect by opening the\r\ndepending sac through the bowel, than by entering the summit of the\r\nbladder above the pubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 3, 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 4, Plate 63.--The vesical orifice is obstructed by two portions, 3,\r\n4, of the prostate, projecting upwards, one from each of its lateral\r\nlobes, 6, 6. The bladder is thickened and fasciculated, and from its\r\nsummit projects a double sac, 1, 2, which is invested by the\r\nperitonaeum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 5, Plate 63.--The prostatic canal is constricted and bent upwards\r\nby the third lobe. The bladder is thickened, and its base is dilated in\r\nthe form of a sac, which is dependent, and upon which rests a calculus.\r\nAn instrument enters the bladder by perforating the third lobe, but does\r\nnot come into contact with the calculus, owing to the low position\r\noccupied by this body.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 6, Plate 63.--Two sacs appear projecting on either side of the base\r\nof the bladder. The right one, 5, contains a calculus, 6; the left one,\r\nof larger dimensions, is empty. The rectum lay in contact with the base\r\nof the bladder between the two sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 6.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 7, Plate 63.--Four calculi are contained in the bladder. This organ\r\nis divided by two septa, 2, 4, into three compartments, each of which,\r\n1, 3, 5, gives lodgment to a calculus; and another, 6, of these bodies\r\nlies impacted in the prostatic canal, and becomes a complete bar to the\r\npassage of a catheter. Supposing lithotomy to be performed in an\r\ninstance of this kind, it is probable that, after the extraction of the\r\ncalculi, 6, 5, the two upper ones, 3, 1, would, owing to their being\r\nembedded in the walls of the bladder, escape the forceps.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 8, Plate 63.-Two large polypi, and many smaller ones, appear\r\ngrowing from the mucous membrane of the prostatic urethra and vesical\r\norifice, and obstructing these parts. In examining this case during life\r\nby the sound, the two larger growths, 1, 2, were mistaken by the surgeon\r\nfor calculi. Such a mistake might well be excused if they happened to be\r\nencrusted with lithic matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 8.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 9, Plate 63.--The base of the bladder, 8, 8, appears dilated into a\r\nlarge uniform sac, and separated from the upper part of the organ by a\r\ncircular horizontal fold, 2, 2. The ureters are also dilated. The left\r\nureter, 3, 4, opens into the sac below this fold, while the right ureter\r\nopens above it into the bladder. In all cases of retention of urine from\r\npermanent obstruction of the urethra, the ureters are generally found\r\nmore or less dilated. Two circumstances combine to this effect--while\r\nthe renal secretion continues to pass into the ureters from above, the\r\ncontents of the bladder under abdominal pressure are forced\r\nregurgitating into them from below, through their orifices.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 63,--Figure 9.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 1, Plate 64.--The bladder, 6, appears symmetrically sacculated. One\r\nsac, 1, is formed at its summit, others, 3, 2, project laterally, and\r\ntwo more, 5, 4, from its base. The ureters, 7, 7, are dilated, and enter\r\nthe bladder between the lateral and inferior sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 2, Plate 64.--The prostate is greatly enlarged, and forms a narrow\r\nring around the vesical orifice. Through this an instrument, 12, enters\r\nthe bladder. The walls of the bladder are thickened and sacculated. On\r\nits left side appear numerous sacs, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and on the\r\ninner surface of its right side appear the orifices of as many more. On\r\nits summit another sac is formed. The ureters, 9, are dilated.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 3, Plate 64.--The prostate is enlarged, its canal is narrowed, and\r\nthe bladder is thickened and contracted. A calculus, 1, 2, appears\r\noccupying nearly the whole vesical interior. The incision in the neck of\r\nthe bladder in lithotomy must necessarily be extensive, to admit of the\r\nextraction of a stone of this size.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 3.\r\n\r\nFIG. 4, Plate 64.--The prostatic canal is contracted by the lateral\r\nlobes, 4, 5; resting upon these, appear three calculi, 1, 2, 3, which\r\nnearly fill the bladder. This organ is thickened and fasciculated. In\r\ncases of this kind, and that last mentioned, the presence of stone is\r\nreadily ascertainable by the sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 4.\r\n\r\nFIG. 5, Plate 64.--The three prostatic lobes are enlarged, and appear\r\ncontracting the vesical orifice. In the walls of the bladder are\r\nembedded several small calculi, 2, 2, 2, 2, which, on being struck with\r\nthe convex side of a sound, might give the impression as though a single\r\nstone of large size existed. In performing lithotomy, these calculi\r\nwould not be within reach of the forceps.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 5.\r\n\r\nFIG. 6, Plate 64.--Two sacculi, 4, 5, appear projecting at the middle\r\nline of the base of the bladder, between the vasa deferentia, 7, 7, and\r\nbehind the prostate, in the situation where the operation of puncturing\r\nthe bladder per anum is recommended to be performed in retention of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 6.\r\n\r\nFIG. 7, Plate 64.--A sac, 4, is situated on the left side of the\r\nbladder, 3, 3, immediately above the orifice of the ureter. In the sac\r\nwas contained a mass of phosphatic calculus. This substance is said to\r\nbe secreted by the mucous lining of the bladder, while in a state of\r\nchronic inflammation, but there seems nevertheless very good reason for\r\nus to believe that it is, like all other calculous matter, a deposit\r\nfrom the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 7.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIG. 8, Plate 64, represents, in section, the relative position of the\r\nparts concerned in catheterism. [Footnote] In performing this operation,\r\nthe patient is to be laid supine; his loins are to be supported on a\r\npillow; and his thighs are to be flexed and drawn apart from each other.\r\nBy this means the perinaeum is brought fully into view, and its\r\nstructures are made to assume a fixed relative position. The operator,\r\nstanding on the patient's left side, is now to raise the penis so as to\r\nrender the urethra, 8, 8, 8, as straight as possible between the meatus,\r\na, and the bulb, 7. The instrument (the concavity of its curve being\r\nturned to the left groin) is now to be inserted into the meatus, and\r\nwhile being gently impelled through the canal, the urethra is to be\r\ndrawn forwards, by the left hand, over the instrument. By stretching the\r\nurethra, we render its sides sufficiently tense for facilitating the\r\npassage of the instrument, and the orifices of the lacunae become\r\nclosed. While the instrument is being passed along this part of the\r\ncanal, its point should be directed fairly towards the urethral opening,\r\n6*, of the triangular ligament, which is situated an inch or so below\r\nthe pubic symphysis, 11. With this object in view, we should avoid\r\ndepressing its handle as yet, lest its point be prematurely tilted up,\r\nand rupture the upper side of the urethra anterior to the ligament. As\r\nsoon as the instrument has arrived at the bulb, its further progress is\r\nliable to be arrested, from these causes:--1st, This portion of the\r\ncanal is the lowest part of its perinaeal curve, 3, 6, 8, and is closely\r\nembraced by the middle fibres of the accelerator urinae muscle. 2nd, It\r\nis immediately succeeded by the commencement of the membranous urethra,\r\nwhich, while being naturally narrower than other parts, is also the more\r\nusual seat of organic stricture, and is subject to spasmodic\r\nconstriction by the fibres of the compressor urethrae. 3d, The\r\ntriangular ligament is behind it, and if the urethral opening of the\r\nligament be not directly entered by the instrument, this will bend the\r\nurethra against the front of that dense structure. On ascertaining these\r\nto be the causes of resistance, the instrument is to be withdrawn a\r\nlittle in the canal, so as to admit of its being readjusted for engaging\r\nprecisely the opening in the triangular ligament. As this structure, 6,\r\nis attached to the membranous urethra, 6*, which perforates it, both\r\nthese parts may be rendered tense, by drawing the penis forwards, and\r\nthereby the instrument may be guided towards and through the aperture.\r\nThe instrument having passed the ligament, regard is now to be paid to\r\nthe direction of the pelvic portion of the canal, which is upwards and\r\nbackwards to the vesical orifice, 3, d, 3. In order that the point of\r\nthe instrument may freely traverse the urethra in this direction, its\r\nhandle, a, requires to be depressed, b c, slowly towards the perinaeum,\r\nand at the same time to be impelled steadily back in the line d, d,\r\nthrough the pubic arch, 11. If the third lobe of the prostate happen to\r\nbe enlarged, the vesical orifice will accordingly be more elevated than\r\nusual. In this case, it becomes necessary to depress the instrument to a\r\ngreater extent than is otherwise required, so that its point may\r\nsurmount the obstacle. But since the suspensory ligament of the penis,\r\n10, and the perinaeal structures prevent the handle being depressed\r\nbeyond a certain degree, which is insufficient for the object to be\r\nattained, the instrument should possess the prostatic curve, c c,\r\ncompared with c b.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: It may be necessary for me to state that, with the exception\r\nof this figure (which is obviously a plan, but sufficiently accurate for\r\nthe purposes it is intended to serve) all the others representing\r\npathological conditions and congenital deformities of the urethra, the\r\nprostate, and the bladder, have been made by myself from natural\r\nspecimens in the museums and hospitals of London and Paris.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\nPlate 64,--Figure 8.\r\n\r\nIn the event of its being impossible to pass a catheter by the urethra,\r\nin cases of retention of urine threatening rupture, the base or the\r\nsummit of the bladder, according as either part may be reached with the\r\ngreater safety to the peritonaeal sac, will require to be punctured. If\r\nthe prostate be greatly and irregularly enlarged, it will be safer to\r\npuncture the bladder above the pubes, and here the position of the organ\r\nin regard to the peritonaeum, 1, becomes the chief consideration. The\r\nshape of the bladder varies very considerably from its state of\r\ncollapse, 3, 3, 5, to those of mediate, 3, 3, 2, 1, and extreme\r\ndistention, 3, 3, 4. This change of form is chiefly effected by the\r\nexpansive elevation of its upper half, which is invested by the\r\nperitonaeum. As the summit of the bladder falls below, and rises above\r\nthe level of the upper margin of the pubic symphysis, it carries the\r\nperitonaeum with it in either direction. While the bladder is fully\r\nexpanded, 4, there occurs an interval between the margin of the\r\nsymphysis pubis and the point of reflexion of the peritonaeum, from the\r\nrecti muscles, to the summit of the viscus. At this interval, close to\r\nthe pubes, and in the median line, the trocar may be safely passed\r\nthrough the front wall of the bladder. The instrument should, in all\r\ncases, be directed downwards and backwards, h, h, in a line pointing to\r\nthe hollow of the sacrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARY ON PLATES 65 & 66.\r\n\r\nTHE SURGICAL DISSECTION OF THE POPLITEAL SPACE\r\nAND THE POSTERIOR CRURAL REGION.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the bend of the knee with the bend of the elbow, as evident\r\na correspondence can be discerned between these two regions, as exists\r\nbetween the groin and the axilla.\r\n\r\nBehind the knee-joint, the muscles which connect the leg with the thigh\r\nenclose the space named popliteal. When the integuments and subcutaneous\r\nsubstance are removed from this place, the dense fascia lata may be seen\r\nbinding these muscles so closely together as to leave but a very narrow\r\ninterval between them at the mesial line. On removing this fascia, B B M\r\nM, Plate 65, the muscles part asunder, and the popliteal space as\r\nusually described is thereby formed. This region now presents of a\r\nlozenge-shaped form, B J D K, of which the widest diameter, D J, is\r\nopposite the knee-joint. The flexor muscles, C D J, in diverging from\r\neach other as they pass down from the sides of the thigh to those of the\r\nupper part of the leg, form the upper angle of this space; whilst its\r\nlower angle is described by the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, E\r\nE, arising inside the flexors, from the condyles of the femur. The\r\npopliteal space is filled with adipose substance, in which are embedded\r\nseveral lymphatic bodies and through which pass the principal vessels\r\nand nerves to the leg.\r\n\r\nIn the dissection of the popliteal space, the more important parts first\r\nmet with are the branches of the great sciatic nerve. In the upper angle\r\nof the space, this nerve will be found dividing into the peronaeal, I,\r\nand posterior tibial branches, H K. The peronaeal nerve descends close\r\nto the inner margin of the tendon, J, of the biceps muscle; and, having\r\nreached the outer side of the knee, I*, Plate 66, below the insertion of\r\nthe tendon into the head of the fibula, winds round the neck of this\r\nbone under cover of the peronaeus longus muscle, S, to join the anterior\r\ntibial artery. The posterior tibial nerve, H K, Plate 65, descends the\r\npopliteal space midway to the cleft between the heads of the\r\ngastrocnemius; and, after passing beneath this muscle, to gain the inner\r\nside of the vessels, H*, Plate 66, it then accompanies the posterior\r\ntibial artery. On the same plane with and close to the posterior tibial\r\nnerve in the popliteal space, will be seen the terminal branch of the\r\nlesser sciatic nerve, together with a small artery and vein destined for\r\ndistribution to the skin and other superficial parts on the back of the\r\nknee. Opposite the heads of the gastrocnemius, the peronaeal and\r\nposterior tibial nerves give off each a branch, both of which descend\r\nalong the mesial line of the calf, and joining near the upper end of the\r\ntendo Achillis, the single nerve here, N, Plate 65, becomes superficial\r\nto the fascia, and thence descends behind the outer ankle to gain the\r\nexternal border of the foot, where it divides into cutaneous branches\r\nand others to be distributed to the three or four outer toes. In company\r\nwith this nerve will be seen the posterior saphena vein, L, which,\r\ncommencing behind the outer ankle, ascends the mesial line of the calf\r\nto join the popliteal vein, G, in the cleft between the heads of the\r\ngastrocnemius.\r\n\r\nOn removing next the adipose substance and lymphatic glands, we expose\r\nthe popliteal vein and artery. The relative position of these vessels\r\nand the posterior tibial nerve, may now be seen. Between the heads of\r\nthe gastrocnemius, the nerve, H, giving off large branches to this\r\nmuscle, lies upon the popliteal vein, G, where this is joined by the\r\nposterior saphena vein. Beneath the veins lies the popliteal artery, F.\r\nOn tracing the vessels and nerve from this point upwards through the\r\npopliteal space, we find the nerve occupying a comparatively superficial\r\nposition at the mesial line, while the vessels are directed upwards,\r\nforwards, and inwards, passing deeply, as they become covered by the\r\ninner flexor muscles, C D, to the place where they perforate the tendon\r\nof the adductor magnus on the inner side of the lower third of the\r\nfemur.\r\n\r\nThe popliteal artery, F, Plate 66, being the continuation of the\r\nfemoral, extends from the opening in the great adductor tendon at the\r\njunction of the middle and lower third of the thigh, to the point where\r\nit divides, in the upper, and back part of the leg, at the lower border\r\nof the popliteus muscle, L, into the anterior and posterior tibial\r\nbranches. In order to expose the vessel through this extent, we have to\r\ndivide and reflect the heads of the gastrocnemius muscle, E E, and to\r\nretract the inner flexors. The popliteal artery will now be seen lying\r\nobliquely over the middle of the back of the joint. It is deeply placed\r\nin its whole course. Its upper and lower thirds are covered by large\r\nmuscles; whilst the fascia and a quantity of adipose tissue overlies its\r\nmiddle. The upper part of the artery rests upon the femur, its middle\r\npart upon the posterior ligament of the joint, and its lower part upon\r\nthe popliteus muscle. The popliteal vein, G; adheres to the artery in\r\nits whole course, being situated on its outer side above, and posterior\r\nto it below. The vein is not unfrequently found to be double; one vein\r\nlying to either side of the artery, and both having branches of\r\ncommunication with each other, which cross behind the artery. In some\r\ninstances the posterior saphena vein, instead of joining the popliteal\r\nvein, ascends superficially to terminate in some of the large veins of\r\nthe thigh. Numerous lymphatic vessels accompany the superficial and deep\r\nveins into the popliteal space, where they join the lymphatic bodies,\r\nwhich here lie in the course of the artery.\r\n\r\nThe branches derived from the popliteal artery are the muscular and the\r\narticular. The former spring from the vessel opposite those parts of the\r\nseveral muscles which lie in contact with it; the latter are generally\r\nfive in number--two superior, two inferior, and one median. The two\r\nsuperior articular branches arise from either side of the artery, and\r\npass, the one beneath the outer, the other beneath the inner flexors,\r\nabove the knee-joint; and the two inferior pass off from it, the one\r\ninternally, the other externally, beneath the heads of the gastrocnemius\r\nbelow the joint; while the middle articular enters the joint through the\r\nposterior ligament. The two superior and inferior articular branches\r\nanastomose freely around the knee behind, laterally, and in front, where\r\nthey are joined by the terminal branches of the anastomotic, from the\r\nfemoral, and by those of the recurrent, from the anterior tibial. The\r\nmain vessel, having arrived at the lower border of the popliteus muscle,\r\ndivides into two branches, of which one passes through the interosseous\r\nligament to become the anterior tibial; while the other, after\r\ndescending a short way between the bones of the leg, separates into the\r\nperonaeal and posterior tibial arteries. In some rare instances the\r\npopliteal artery is found to divide above the popliteus muscle into the\r\nanterior, or the posterior tibial, or the peronaeal.\r\n\r\nThe two large muscles, (gastrocnemius and soleus,) forming the calf of\r\nthe leg, have to be removed together with the deep fascia in order to\r\nexpose the posterior tibial, and peronaeal vessels and nerves. The\r\nfascia forms a sheath for the vessels, and binds them close to the deep\r\nlayer of muscles in their whole course down the back of the leg. The\r\npoint at which the main artery, F, Plate 66, gives off the anterior\r\ntibial, is at the lower border of the popliteus muscle, on a level with\r\nN, the neck of the fibula; that at which the artery again subdivides\r\ninto the peronaeal, P, and posterior tibial branches, O, is in the\r\nmesial line of the leg, and generally on a level with the junction of\r\nits upper and middle thirds. From this place the two arteries diverge in\r\ntheir descent; the peronaeal being directed along the inner border of\r\nthe fibula towards the back of the outer ankle; while the posterior\r\ntibial, approaching the inner side of the tibia, courses towards the\r\nback of the inner ankle. The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles overlie\r\nboth arteries in their upper two thirds; but as these muscles taper\r\ntowards the mesial line where they end in the tendo Achillis, V V, Plate\r\n65, they leave the posterior tibial artery, O, with its accompanying\r\nnerve and vein, uncovered in the lower part of the leg, except by the\r\nskin and the superficial and deep layers of fasciae. The peronaeal\r\nartery is deeply situated in its whole course. Soon after its origin, it\r\npasses under cover of the flexor longus pollicis, R, a muscle of large\r\nsize arising from the lower three fourths of the fibula, N, and will be\r\nfound overlapped by this muscle on the outer border of the tendo\r\nAchillis, as low down as the outer ankle. The two arteries are\r\naccompanied by venae comites, which, with the short saphena vein, form\r\nthe popliteal vein. The posterior tibial artery is closely followed by\r\nthe posterior tibial nerve. In the popliteal space, this nerve crosses\r\nto the inner side of the posterior tibial artery, where both are about\r\nto pass under the gastrocnemius muscle, to which they give large\r\nbranches. Near the middle of the leg, the nerve recrosses the artery to\r\nits outer side and in this relative position both descend to a point\r\nabout midway between the inner ankle and calcaneum, where they appear\r\nhaving the tendons of the tibialis posticus and flexor longus digitorum\r\nto their inner side and the tendon of the flexor longus pollicis on\r\ntheir outer side. Numerous branches are given off from the nerve and\r\nartery to the neighbouring parts in their course.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the posterior crural arteries are these--the tibial\r\nvessel, in some instances, is larger than usual, while the peronaeal is\r\nsmall, or absent; and, in others, the peronaeal supplies the place of\r\nthe posterior tibial, when the latter is diminished in size. The\r\nperonaeal has been known to take the position of the posterior tibial in\r\nthe lower part of the leg, and to supply the plantar arteries. In\r\nwhatever condition the two vessels may be found, there will always be\r\nseen ramifying around the ankle-joint, articular branches, which\r\nanastomose freely with each other and with those of the anterior tibial.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe popliteal artery is unfavourably circumstanced for the application\r\nof a ligature. It is very deeply situated, and the vein adheres closely\r\nto its posterior surface. Numerous branches (articular and muscular)\r\narise from it at short intervals; and these, besides being a source of\r\ndisturbance to a ligature, are liable to be injured in the operation, in\r\nwhich case the collateral circulation cannot be maintained after the\r\nmain vessel is tied. There is a danger, too, of injuring the middle\r\nbranch of the sciatic nerve, in the incisions required to reach the\r\nartery; and, lastly, there is a possibility of this vessel dividing\r\nhigher up than usual. Considering these facts in reference to those\r\ncases in which it might be supposed necessary to tie the popliteal\r\nartery--such cases, for example, as aneurism of either of the crural\r\narteries, or secondary haemorrhages occurring after amputations of the\r\nleg at a time when the healing process was far advanced and the bleeding\r\nvessels inaccessible,--it becomes a question whether it would not be\r\npreferable to tie the femoral, rather than the popliteal artery. But\r\nwhen the popliteal artery itself becomes affected with aneurism, and\r\nwhen, in addition to the anatomical circumstances which forbid the\r\napplication of a ligature to this vessel, we consider those which are\r\npathological,--such as the coats of the artery being here diseased, the\r\nrelative position of the neighbouring parts being disturbed by the\r\ntumour, and the large irregular wound which would be required to isolate\r\nthe disease, at the risk of danger to the health from profuse\r\nsuppuration, to the limb from destruction of the collateral branches, or\r\nto the joint from cicatrization, rendering it permanently bent,--we must\r\nacknowledge at once the necessity for tying the femoral part of the main\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nWhen the popliteal artery happens to be divided in a wound, it will be\r\nrequired to expose its bleeding orifices, and tie both these in the\r\nwound. For this purpose, the following operation usually recommended for\r\nreaching the vessel may be necessary. The skin and fascia lata are to be\r\nincised in a direction corresponding to that of the vessel. The extent\r\nof the incision must be considerable, (about three inches,) so as the\r\nmore conveniently to expose the artery in its deep situation. On laying\r\nbare the outer margin of the semi-membranosus muscle, while the knee is\r\nstraight, it now becomes necessary to flex the joint, in order that this\r\nmuscle may admit of being pressed inwards from over the vessel. The\r\nexternal margin of the wound, including the middle branch of the sciatic\r\nnerve, should be retracted outwards, so as to ensure the safety of that\r\nnerve, while room is gained for making the deeper incisions. The adipose\r\nsubstance, which is here generally abundant, should now be divided,\r\nbetween the mesial line and the semimembranosus, till the sheath of\r\nthe vessels be exposed. The sheath should be incised at its inner side,\r\nto avoid wounding the popliteal vein. The pulsation of the artery will\r\nnow indicate its exact position. As the vein adheres firmly to the coats\r\nof the artery, some care is required to separate the two vessels, so as\r\nto pass the ligature around each end of the artery from without inwards,\r\nwhile excluding the vein. While this operation is being performed in a\r\ncase of wound of the popliteal artery, the haemorrhage may be arrested\r\nby compressing the femoral vessel, either against the femur or the os\r\npubis.\r\n\r\nIn the operation for tying the posterior tibial artery near its middle,\r\nan incision of three or four inches in extent is to be made through the\r\nskin and fascia, in a line corresponding with the inner posterior margin\r\nof the tibia and the great muscles of the calf. The long saphena vein\r\nshould be here avoided. The origins of the gastrocnemius and soleus\r\nmuscles require to be detached from the tibia, and then the knee is to\r\nbe flexed and the foot extended, so as to allow these muscles to be\r\nretracted from the plane of the vessels. This being done, the deep\r\nfascia which covers the artery and its accompanying nerve is next to be\r\ndivided. The artery will now appear pulsating at a situation an inch\r\nfrom the edge of the tibia. While the ligature is being passed around\r\nthe artery, due care should be taken to exclude the venae comites and\r\nthe nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 65 & 66.\r\n\r\nPLATE 65.\r\n\r\nA.

It is attached on the inner\r\nside of the leg to the spine of the tibia, D, Plate 67, Figure 2, and on\r\nthe outer side it passes over the peronaeal muscles to those forming the\r\ncalf. Between the extensor communis digitorum, B b, and the peronaeus\r\nlongus, F, it sends in a strong process to be attached to the fibula, E.\r\nIn front of the ankle joint, the fascia is increased in density,\r\nconstituting a band (anterior annular ligament) which extends between\r\nthe malleoli, forms sheaths for the several extensor tendons, and binds\r\nthese down in front of the joint. From the lower border of the annular\r\nligament, the fascia is continued over the dorsum of the foot, forming\r\nsheaths for the tendons and muscles of this part. Behind the inner\r\nmalleolus, d, Plate 67, Figure 1, the fascia attached to this process\r\nand to the inner side of the os calcis appears as the internal annular\r\nligament, which being broad and strong, forms a kind of arch, beneath\r\nwhich in special sheaths the flexor tendons, and the posterior tibial\r\nvessel and nerve, pass to the sole of the foot. On tracing the fascia\r\nfrom the front to the back of the leg, it will be seen to divide into\r\ntwo layers--superficial and deep; the former passes over the muscles of\r\nthe calf and their common tendon (tendo Achillis) to which it adheres,\r\nwhile the latter passes between these muscles and the deep flexors. The\r\ndeep layer is that which immediately overlies the posterior tibial and\r\nperonaeal vessels and nerves. While exposing the fascia on the forepart\r\nof the leg and dorsum of the foot, we meet with the musculo-cutaneous\r\nbranch of the peronaeal nerve, which pierces the fascia at about the\r\nmiddle of the limb, and descends superficially in a direction between\r\nthe fibula, and the extensor longus digitorum muscle, and after dividing\r\ninto branches a little above the outer ankle, these traverse in two\r\ngroups the dorsum of the foot, to be distributed to the integuments of\r\nthe five toes. On the inner side of the tibia, D, Plate 67, Figure 1,\r\nwill be seen the internal or long saphena vein, B B, which commencing by\r\nnumerous branches on the dorsal surface of the foot ascends in front of\r\nthe inner ankle, d, to gain the inner side of the leg, after which it\r\nascends behind the inner side of the knee and thigh, till it terminates\r\nat the saphenous opening, where it joins the femoral vein. In its course\r\nalong the lower part of the thigh, the leg and the foot, this vein is\r\nclosely accompanied by the long saphenous nerve, derived from the\r\nanterior crural, and also by a group of lymphatics.\r\n\r\nBy removing the fascia from the front of the leg and foot, we expose the\r\nseveral muscles and tendons which are situated in these parts. In the\r\nupper part of the leg the tibialis anticus, A, Plate 67, Figure 2, and\r\nextensor-communis muscle, B, are adherent to the fascia which covers\r\nthem, and to the intermuscular septum which divides them. In the lower\r\npart of the leg where these muscles and the extensor pollicis, C,\r\nterminate in tendons, a b c, they are readily separable from one\r\nanother. The tibialis anticus lies along the outer side of the tibia,\r\nfrom which, and from the head of the fibula and interosseous ligament,\r\nit arises tendinous and fleshy. This muscle is superficial in its whole\r\nlength; its tendon commencing about the middle of the leg, passes in a\r\nseparate loose sheath of the annular ligament in front of the inner\r\nankle, to be inserted into the inner side of the cuneiform bone and base\r\nof the metatarsal bone of the great toe. The extensor communis digitorum\r\nlies close to the outer side of the anterior tibial muscle, and arises\r\nfrom the upper three-fourths of the fibula, from the interosseous\r\nligament and intermuscular septum. At the lower part of the leg, this\r\nmuscle ends in three or four flat tendons, which pass through a ring of\r\nthe annular ligament, and extending forwards, b b b b, over the dorsum\r\nof the foot, become inserted into the four outer toes. The peronaeus\r\ntertius or anterior, is that part of the common extensor muscle which is\r\ninserted into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. On separating the\r\nanterior tibial and common extensor muscles, we find the extensor\r\npollicis, C c, which, concealed between the two, arises from the middle\r\nof the fibula, and the interosseous ligament; its tendon passes beneath\r\nthe annular ligament in front of the ankle joint, and after traversing\r\nthe inner part of the dorsum of the foot, becomes inserted into the\r\nthree phalanges of the great toe. Beneath the tendons of the extensor\r\ncommunis on the instep, will be seen the extensor digitorum brevis, K K,\r\nlying in an oblique direction, between the upper and outer part of the\r\nos calcis, from which it arises, and the four inner toes, into each of\r\nwhich it is inserted by a small flat tendon, which joins the\r\ncorresponding tendon of the long common extensor.\r\n\r\nThe anterior tibial artery, L, Plate 67, Figure 2, extends from the\r\nupper part of the interosseous ligament which it perforates, to the bend\r\nof the ankle, whence it is continued over the dorsum of the foot. In the\r\nupper third of the leg, the anterior tibial artery lies deeply situated\r\nbetween the tibialis anticus, and flexor communis muscles. Here it will\r\nbe found, close in front of the interosseous ligament, at about an inch\r\nand-a-half in depth from the anterior surface, and removed from the\r\nspine of the tibia at an interval equal to the width of the tibialis\r\nanticus muscle. In its course down the leg, the vessel passes obliquely\r\nfrom a point close to the inner side of the neck of the fibula, to\r\nmidway between the ankles. In its descent, it becomes gradually more\r\nsuperficial. In the middle of the leg, the vessel passes between the\r\nextensor longus pollicis, and the tibialis anticus muscles. Above,\r\nbeneath, and below the annular ligament, this artery will be found to\r\npass midway between the extensor pollicis tendon, and those of the\r\nextensor communis, and to hold the same relation to these parts in\r\ntraversing the dorsum of the foot, till it gains the interval between\r\nthe two inner metatarsal bones, where it divides into two branches, one\r\nof which passes forwards in the first interdigital space, while the\r\nother sinks between the bones, to inosculate with the plantar arteries.\r\nThe innermost tendon of the short common extensor crosses in front of\r\nthe dorsal artery of the foot near its termination. Between the ankle\r\nand the first interosseous space the artery lies comparatively\r\nsuperficial, being here covered only by the skin and fascia and cellular\r\nmembrane. Two veins accompany the anterior tibial artery and its\r\ncontinuation on the dorsum of the foot. The anterior tibial nerve, a\r\nbranch of the peronaeal, joins the outer side of the artery, about the\r\nmiddle of the leg, and accompanies it closely in this position, till\r\nboth have passed beneath the annular ligament. On the dorsum of the foot\r\nthe nerve will be found to the inner side of the artery.\r\n\r\nThe branches of the anterior tibial artery are articular and muscular.\r\nFrom its upper end arises the recurrent branch which anastomoses in\r\nfront of the knee with the articular branches of the popliteal artery.\r\nNear the ankle, arise on either side of the vessel two malleolar\r\nbranches, internal and external, the former communicating with branches\r\nof the posterior tibial, the latter with those of the peronaeal.\r\nNumerous muscular branches arise, at short intervals, from the vessel in\r\nits passage down the leg. Tarsal, metatarsal, and small digital branches\r\nspring from the dorsal artery of the foot. The anterior tibial artery is\r\nrarely found to deviate from its usual course; in some cases it appears\r\nof less or of greater size than usual. When this vessel appears\r\ndeficient, its place is usually supplied by some branch of the peronaeal\r\nor posterior tibial, which pierces the interosseous ligament from\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe anterior tibial artery when requiring a ligature to be applied to it\r\nin any part of its course, may be exposed by an incision, extending for\r\nthree or four inches, (more or less, according to the depth of the\r\nvessel) along the outer border of the tibialis anticus muscle. The\r\nfibrous septum between this muscle and the extensor communis, will serve\r\nas a guide to the vessel in the upper third of the leg, where it lies\r\ndeeply on the interosseous ligament. In the middle of the leg, the\r\nvessel is to be sought for between the anterior tibial and extensor\r\nlongus pollicis muscles. In the lower part of the leg, and on the dorsum\r\nof the foot, it will be found between the extensor longus pollicis, and\r\nextensor communis tendons, the former being taken as a guide for the\r\nincision. In passing the ligature around this vessel at either of these\r\nsituations, care is required to avoid including the venae comites and\r\nthe accompanying nerve.\r\n\r\nThe sole of the foot is covered by a hard and thick integument, beneath\r\nwhich will be seen a large quantity of granulated adipose tissue so\r\nintersected by bands of fibrous structure as to form a firm, but elastic\r\ncushion, in the situations particularly of the heel and joints of the\r\ntoes. On removing this structure, we expose the plantar fascia, B, Plate\r\n68, Figure 1, extending from the os calcis, A, to the toes. This fascia\r\nis remarkably strong, especially its middle and outer parts, which serve\r\nto retain the arched form of the foot, and thereby to protect the\r\nplantar structures from superincumbent pressure during the erect\r\nposture. The superficial plantar muscles become exposed on removing the\r\nplantar fascia, to which they adhere. In the centre will be seen the\r\nthick fleshy flexor digitorum brevis muscle, B, arising from the\r\ninferior part of the os calcis, and passing forwards to divide into four\r\nsmall tendons, b b b b, for the four outer toes. On the inner side of\r\nthe foot appears the abductor pollicis, D, arising from the inner side\r\nof the os calcis and internal annular ligament, and passing to be\r\ninserted with the flexor pollicis brevis, H, into the sesamoid bones and\r\nbase of the first phalanx of the great toe. On the external border of\r\nthe foot is situated the abductor minimi digiti, C, arising from the\r\nouter side of the os calcis, and passing to be inserted with the flexor\r\nbrevis minimi digiti into the base of the first phalanx of the little\r\ntoe. When the flexor brevis digitorum muscle is removed, the plantar\r\narteries, L M, and nerves, are brought partially into view; and by\r\nfurther dividing the abductor pollicis, D, their continuity with the\r\nposterior tibial artery and nerves, K L, Plate 67, Figure 1, behind the\r\ninner ankle may be seen.\r\n\r\nThe plantar branches of the posterior tibial artery are the internal and\r\nexternal, both of which are deeply placed between the superficial and\r\ndeep plantar muscles. The internal plantar artery is much the smaller of\r\nthe two. The external plantar artery, L, Plate 68, Figure 1, is large,\r\nand seems to be the proper continuation of the posterior tibial. It\r\ncorresponds, in the foot, to the deep palmar arch in the hand. Placed at\r\nfirst between the origin of the abductor pollicis and the calcaneum, the\r\nexternal plantar artery passes outwards between the short common flexor,\r\nB, and the flexor accessorius, E, to gain the inner borders of the\r\nmuscles of the little toe; from this place it curves deeply inwards\r\nbetween the tendons of the long common flexor of the toes, F f f, and\r\nthe tarso-metatarsal joints, to gain the outer side of the first\r\nmetatarsal bone, H, Plate 68, Figure 2. In this course it is covered in\r\nits posterior half by the flexor brevis digitorum, and in its anterior\r\nhalf by this muscle, together with the tendons of the long flexor, F,\r\nPlate 68, Figure 1, of the toes and the lumbricales muscles, i i i i.\r\nFrom the external plantar artery are derived the principal branches for\r\nsupplying the structures in the sole of the foot. The internal plantar\r\nnerve divides into four branches, for the supply of the four inner toes,\r\nto which they pass between the superficial and deep flexors. The\r\nexternal plantar nerve, passing along the inner side of the\r\ncorresponding artery, sends branches to supply the outer toe and\r\nadjacent side of the next, and then passes, with the artery, between the\r\ndeep common flexor tendon and the metatarsus, to be distributed to the\r\ndeep plantar muscles.\r\n\r\nThe posterior tibial artery may be tied behind the inner ankle, on being\r\nlaid bare in the following way:--A curved incision (the concavity\r\nforwards) of two inches in length, is to be made midway between the\r\ntendo Achillis and the ankle. The skin and superficial fascia having\r\nbeen divided, we expose the inner annular ligament, which will be found\r\nenclosing the vessels and nerve in a canal distinct from that of the\r\ntendons. Their fibrous sheath having been slit open, the artery will be\r\nseen between the venae comites, and with the nerve, in general, behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the arteries of the leg or the foot are wounded, and the\r\nhaemorrhage cannot be commanded by compression, it will be necessary to\r\nsearch for the divided ends of the vessel in the wound, and to apply a\r\nligature to both. The expediency of this measure must become fully\r\napparent when we consider the frequent anastomoses existing between the\r\ncollateral branches of the crural arteries, and that a ligature applied\r\nto any one of these above the seat of injury will not arrest the\r\nrecurrent circulation through the vessels of the foot.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES 67 & 68.\r\n\r\nPLATE 67.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1.\r\nA.

The heart, occupying, it may be said,\r\nthe centre of the thorax, circulates the blood in the same way, by\r\nsimilar channels, to an equal extent, in equal pace, and at the same\r\nperiod of time, through both sides of the body. In its adult normal\r\ncondition, the heart presents itself as a double or symmetrical organ.\r\nThe two hearts, though united and appearing single, are nevertheless, as\r\nto their respective cavities, absolutely distinct. Each heart consists\r\nagain of two compartments--an auricle and a ventricle. The two auricles\r\nare similar in structure and form. The two ventricles are similar in the\r\nsame respects. A septum divides the two auricles, and another--the two\r\nventricles. Between the right auricle and ventricle, forming the right\r\nheart, there exists a valvular apparatus (tricuspid), by which these two\r\ncompartments communicate; and a similar valve (bicuspid) admits of\r\ncommunication between the left auricle and ventricle. The two hearts\r\nbeing distinct, and the main vessels arising from each respectively\r\nbeing distinct likewise, it follows that the capillary peripheries of\r\nthese vessels form the only channels through which the blood issuing\r\nfrom one heart can enter the other.\r\n\r\nII.--As the aorta of the left heart ramifies throughout all parts of the\r\nbody, and as the countless ramifications of this vessel terminate in an\r\nequal number of ramifications of the principal veins of the right heart,\r\nit will appear that between the systemic vessels of the two hearts\r\nrespectively, the capillary anastomotic circulation reigns universal.\r\n\r\nIII.--The body generally is marked by the median line, from the vertex\r\nto the perinaeum, into corresponding halves. All parts excepting the\r\nmain bloodvessels in the neighbourhood of the heart are naturally\r\ndivisible by this line into equals. The vessels of each heart, in being\r\ndistributed to both sides of the body alike, cross each other at the\r\nmedian line, and hence they are inseparable according to this line,\r\nunless by section. If the vessels proper to each heart, right and left,\r\nramified alone within the limits of their respective sides of the body,\r\nthen their capillary anastomosis could only take place along the median\r\nline, and here in such case they might be separated by median section\r\ninto two distinct systems. But as each system is itself double in\r\nbranching into both sides of the body, the two would be at the same time\r\nequally divided by vertical section. From this it will appear that the\r\nvessels belonging to each heart form a symmetrical system, corresponding\r\nto the sides of the body, and that the capillary anastomosis of these\r\nsystemic veins and arteries is divisible into two great fields, one\r\nsituated on either side of the median line, and touching at this line.\r\n\r\nIV.--The vessels of the right heart do not communicate at their\r\ncapillary peripheries, for its veins are systemic, and its arteries are\r\npulmonary. The vessels of the left heart do not anastomose, for its\r\nveins are pulmonary, and its arteries are systemic. The arteries of the\r\nright and left hearts cannot anastomose, for the former are pulmonary,\r\nand the latter are systemic; and neither can the veins of the right and\r\nleft hearts, for a similar reason. Hence, therefore, there can be,\r\nbetween the vessels of both hearts, but two provinces of\r\nanastomosis--viz., that of the lungs, and that of the system. In the\r\nlungs, the arteries of the right heart and the veins of the left\r\nanastomose. In the body generally (not excepting the lungs), the\r\narteries of the left heart, and the veins of the right, anastomose; and\r\nthus in the pulmonary and the systemic circulation, each heart plays an\r\nequal part through the medium of its proper vessels. The pulmonary bear\r\nto the systemic vessels the same relation as a lesser circle contained\r\nwithin a greater; and the vessels of each heart form the half of each\r\ncircle, the arteries of the one being opposite the veins of the other.\r\n\r\nV.--The two hearts being, by the union of their similar forms, as one\r\norgan in regard to place, act, by an agreement of their corresponding\r\nfunctions, as one organ in respect to time. The action of the auricles\r\nis synchronous; that of the ventricles is the same; that of the auricles\r\nand ventricles is consentaneous; and that of the whole heart is\r\nrhythmical, or harmonious--the diastole of the auricles occurring in\r\nharmonical time with the systole of the ventricles, and vice versa. By\r\nthis correlative action of both hearts, the pulmonary and systemic\r\ncirculations take place synchronously; and the phenomena resulting in\r\nboth reciprocate and balance each other. In the pulmonary circulation,\r\nthe blood is aerated, decarbonized, and otherwise depurated; whilst in\r\nthe systemic circulation, it is carbonized and otherwise deteriorated.\r\n\r\nVI.--The circulation through the lungs and the system is carried on\r\nthrough vessels having the following form and relative position, which,\r\nas being most usual, is accounted normal. The two brachio-cephalic veins\r\njoining at the root of the neck, and the two common iliac veins joining\r\nin front of the lumbar vertebrae, form the superior and inferior venae\r\ncavae, by which the blood is returned from the upper and lower parts of\r\nthe body to the right auricle, and thence it enters the right ventricle,\r\nby which it is impelled through the pulmonary artery into the two lungs;\r\nand from these it is returned (aerated) by the pulmonary veins to the\r\nleft auricle, which passes it into the left ventricle, and by this it is\r\nimpelled through the systemic aorta, which branches throughout the body\r\nin a similar way to the systemic veins, with which the aortic branches\r\nanastomose generally. On viewing together the system of vessels proper\r\nto each heart, they will be seen to exhibit in respect to the body a\r\nfigure in doubly symmetrical arrangement, of which the united hearts\r\nform a duplex centre. At this centre, which is the theatre of\r\nmetamorphosis, the principal abnormal conditions of the bloodvessels\r\nappear; and in order to find the signification of these, we must retrace\r\nthe stages of development.\r\n\r\nVII.--From the first appearance of an individualized centre in the\r\nvascular area of the human embryo, that centre (punctum saliens) and the\r\nvessels immediately connected with it, undergo a phaseal metamorphosis,\r\ntill such time after birth as they assume their permanent character. In\r\neach stage of metamorphosis, the embryo heart and vessels typify the\r\nnormal condition of the organ in one of the lower classes of animals.\r\nThe several species of the organ in these classes are parallel to the\r\nvarious stages of change in the human organ. In its earliest condition,\r\nthe human heart presents the form of a simple canal, similar to that of\r\nthe lower Invertebrata, the veins being connected with its posterior\r\nend, while from its anterior end a single artery emanates. The canal\r\nnext assumes a bent shape, and the vessels of both its ends become\r\nthereby approximated. The canal now being folded upon itself in\r\nheart-shape, next becomes constricted in situations, marking out the\r\nfuture auricle and ventricle and arterial bulb, which still communicate\r\nwith each other. From the artery are given off on either side\r\nsymmetrically five branches (branchial arches), which arch laterally\r\nfrom before, outwards and backwards, and unite in front of the\r\nvertebrae, forming the future descending aorta. In this condition, the\r\nhuman heart and vessels resemble the Piscean pipe. The next changes\r\nwhich take place consist in the gradual subdivision, by means of septa,\r\nof the auricle and ventricle respectively into two cavities. On the\r\nseparation of the single auricle into two, while the ventricle as yet\r\nremains single, the heart presents that condition which is proper to the\r\nReptilian class. The interauricular and interventricular septa, by\r\ngradual development from without inwards, at length meet and coalesce,\r\nthereby dividing the two cavities into four--two auricles and two\r\nventricles--a condition proper to the Avian and Mammalian classes\r\ngenerally. In the centre of the interauricular septum of the human\r\nheart, an aperture (foramen ovale) is left as being necessary to the\r\nfoetal circulation. While the septa are being completed, the arterial\r\nbulb also becomes divided by a partition formed in its interior in such\r\na manner as to adjust the two resulting arteries, the one in connexion\r\nwith the right, the other with the left ventricle. The right ventricular\r\nartery (pulmonary aorta) so formed, has assigned to it the fifth\r\n(posterior) opposite pair of arches, and of these the right one\r\nremaining pervious to the point where it gives off the right pulmonary\r\nbranch, becomes obliterated beyond this point to that where it joins the\r\ndescending aorta, while the left arch remains pervious during foetal\r\nlife, as the ductus arteriosus still communicating with the descending\r\naorta, and giving off at its middle the left pulmonary branch. The left\r\nventricular artery (systemic aorta) is formed of the fourth arch of the\r\nleft side, while the opposite arch (fourth right) is altogether\r\nobliterated. The third and second arches remain pervious on both sides,\r\nafterwards to become the right and left brachio-cephalic arteries. The\r\nfirst pair of arches, if not converted into the vertebral arteries, or\r\nthe thyroid axes, are altogether metamorphosed. By these changes the\r\nheart and primary arteries assume the character in which they usually\r\npresent themselves at birth, and in all probability the primary veins\r\ncorresponded in form, number, and distribution with the arterial\r\nvessels, and underwent, at the same time, a similar mode of\r\nmetamorphosis. One point in respect to the original symmetrical\r\ncharacter of the primary veins is demonstrable--namely, that in front of\r\nthe aortic branches the right and left brachio-cephalic veins, after\r\njoining by a cross branch, descend separately on either side of the\r\nheart, and enter (as two superior venae cavae) the right auricle by\r\ndistinct orifices. In some of the lower animals, this double condition\r\nof the superior veins is constant, but in the human species the left\r\nvein below the cross branch (left brachio-cephalic) becomes obliterated,\r\nwhilst the right vein (vena cava superior) receives the two\r\nbrachio-cephalic veins, and in this condition remains throughout life.\r\nAfter birth, on the commencement of respiration, the foramen ovale of\r\nthe interauricular septum closes, and the ductus arteriosus becomes\r\nimpervious. This completes the stages of metamorphosis, and changes the\r\ncourse of the simple foetal circulation to one of a more complex\r\norder--viz., the systemic-pulmonary characteristic of the normal state\r\nin the adult body.\r\n\r\nVIII.--Such being the phases of metamorphosis of the primary (branchial)\r\narches which yield the vessels in their normal adult condition, we\r\nobtain in this history an explanation of the signification not only of\r\nsuch of their anomalies as are on record, but of such also as are\r\npotential in the law of development; a few of them will suffice to\r\nillustrate the meaning of the whole number:--lst, The interventricular\r\nas well as the interauricular septum may be arrested in growth, leaving\r\nan aperture in the centre of each; the former condition is natural to\r\nthe human foetus, the latter to the reptilian class, while both would be\r\nabnormal in the human adult. 2nd. The heart may be cleft at its apex in\r\nthe situation of the interventricular septum--a condition natural to the\r\nDugong, A similar cleavage may divide the base of the heart in the\r\nsituation of the interauricular septum. 3rd. The partitioning of the\r\nbulbus arteriosus may occur in such a manner as to assign to the two\r\naortae a relative position, the reverse of that which they normally\r\noccupy--the pulmonary aorta springing from the left ventricle and the\r\nsystemic aorta arising from the right, and giving off from its arch the\r\nprimary branches in the usual order. [Footnote 1] 4th. As the two aortae\r\nresult from a division of the common primary vessel (bulbus arteriosus),\r\nan arrest in the growth of the partition would leave them still as one\r\nvessel, which (supposing the ventricular septum remained also\r\nincomplete) would then arise from a single ventricle. 5th. The ductus\r\narteriosus may remain pervious, and while co-existing with the proper\r\naortic arch, two arches would then appear on the left side. 6th. The\r\nsystemic normal aortic arch may be obliterated as far up as the\r\ninnominate branch, and while the ductus arteriosus remains pervious, and\r\nleading from the pulmonary artery to the descending part of the aortic\r\narch, this vessel would then present the appearance of a branch\r\nascending from the left side and giving off the brachio-cephalic\r\narteries. The right ventricular artery would then, through the medium of\r\nthe ductus arteriosus, supply both the lungs and the system. Such a\r\nstate of the vessels would require (in order that the circulation of a\r\nmixed blood might be carried on) that the two ventricles freely\r\ncommunicate. 7th. If the fourth arch of the right side remained pervious\r\nopposite the proper aortic arch, there would exist two aortic arches\r\nplaced symmetrically, one on either side of the vertebral column, and,\r\njoining below, would include in their circle the trachea and oesophagus.\r\n8th. If the fifth arch of the right side remained pervious opposite the\r\nopen ductus arteriosus, both vessels would present a similar\r\narrangement, as two symmetrical ducti arteriosi co-existing with\r\nsymmetrical aortic arches. 9th. If the vessels appeared co-existing in\r\nthe two conditions last mentioned, they would represent four aortic\r\narches, two on either side of the vertebral column. 10th. If the fourth\r\nright arch, instead of the fourth left (aorta), remained pervious, the\r\nsystemic aortic arch would then be turned to the right side of the\r\nvertebral column, and have the trachea and oesophagus on its left. 11th.\r\nWhen the bulbus arteriosus divides itself into three parts, the two\r\nlateral parts, in becoming connected with the left ventricle, will\r\nrepresent a double ascending systemic aorta, and having the pulmonary\r\nartery passing between them to the lungs. 12th. When of the two original\r\nsuperior venae cavae the right one instead of the left suffers\r\nmetamorphosis, the vena cava superior will then appear on the left side\r\nof the normal aortic arch. [Footnote 2] Of these malformations, some are\r\nrather frequently met with, others very seldom, and others cannot exist\r\ncompatible with life after birth. Those which involve a more or less\r\nimperfect discharge of the blood-aerating functions of the lungs, are in\r\nthose degrees more or less fatal, and thus nature aborting as to the\r\nfitness of her creation, cancels it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This physiological truth has, I find, been applied by Dr.\r\nR. Quain to the explanation of a numerous class of malformations\r\nconnected with the origins of the great vessels from the heart, and of\r\ntheir primary branches. See The Lancet, vol. I. 1842.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For an analysis of the occasional peculiarities of these\r\nprimary veins in the human subject, see an able and original monograph\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions, Part 1., 1850, entitled, \"On the\r\nDevelopment of the Great Anterior Veins in Man and Mammalia.\" By John\r\nMarshall, F.R.C.S., &c. ]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--The portal system of veins passing to the liver, and the hepatic\r\nveins passing from this organ to join the inferior vena cava, exhibit in\r\nrespect to the median line of the body an example of a-symmetry, since\r\nappearing on the right side, they have no counterparts on the left. As\r\nthe law of symmetry seems to prevail universally in the development of\r\norganized beings, forasmuch as every lateral organ or part has its\r\ncounterpart, while every central organ is double or complete, in having\r\ntwo similar sides, then the portal system, as being an exception to this\r\nlaw, is as a natural note of interrogation questioning the signification\r\nof that fact, and in the following observations, it appears to me, the\r\nanswer may be found. Every artery in the body has its companion vein or\r\nveins. The inferior vena cava passes sidelong with the aorta in the\r\nabdomen. Every branch of the aorta which ramifies upon the abdominal\r\nparietes has its accompanying vein returning either to the vena cava or\r\nthe vena azygos, and entering either of these vessels at a point on the\r\nsame level as that at which itself arises. The renal vessels also have\r\nthis arrangement. But all the other veins of the abdominal viscera,\r\ninstead of entering the vena cava opposite their corresponding arteries,\r\nunite into a single trunk (vena portae), which enters the liver. The\r\nspecial purpose of this destination of the portal system is obvious, but\r\nthe function of a part gives no explanation of its form or relative\r\nposition, whether singular or otherwise. On viewing the vessels in\r\npresence of the general law of symmetrical development, it occurs to me\r\nthat the portal and hepatic veins form one continuous system, which\r\ntaken in the totality, represents the companion veins of the arteries of\r\nthe abdominal viscera. The liver under this interpretation appears as a\r\ngland developed midway upon these veins, and dismembering them into a\r\nmesh of countless capillary vessels, (a condition necessary for all\r\nprocesses of secretion,) for the special purpose of decarbonizing the\r\nblood. In this great function the liver is an organ correlative or\r\ncompensative to the lungs, whose office is similar. The secretion of the\r\nliver (bile) is fluidform; that of the lungs is aeriform. The bile being\r\nnecessary to the digestive process, the liver has a duct to convey that\r\nproduct of its secretion to the intestines. The trachea is as it were\r\nthe duct of the lungs. In the liver, then, the portal and hepatic veins\r\nbeing continuous as veins, the two systems, notwithstanding their\r\napparent distinctness, caused by the intervention of the hepatic\r\nlobules, may be regarded as the veins corresponding with the arteries of\r\nthe coeliac axis, and the two mesenteric. The hepatic artery and the\r\nhepatic veins evidently do not pair in the sense of afferent and\r\nefferent, with respect to the liver, both these vessels having\r\ndestinations as different as those of the bronchial artery and the\r\npulmonary veins in the lungs. The bronchial artery is attended by its\r\nvein proper, while the vein which corresponds to the hepatic artery\r\njoins either the hepatic or portal veins traversing the liver, and in\r\nthis position escapes notice.[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: In instancing these facts, as serving under comparison to\r\nexplain how the hepatic vessels constitute no radical exception to the\r\nlaw of symmetry which presides over the development and distribution of\r\nthe vascular system as a whole, I am led to inquire in what respect (if\r\nin any) the liver as an organ forms an exception to this general law\r\neither in shape, in function, or in relative position. While seeing that\r\nevery central organ is single and symmetrical by the union of two\r\nabsolutely similar sides, and that each lateral pair of organs is double\r\nby the disunion of sides so similar to each other in all respects that\r\nthe description of either side serves for the other opposite, it has\r\nlong since seemed to me a reasonable inference that, since the liver on\r\nthe right has no counterpart as a liver on the left, and that, since the\r\nspleen on the left has no counterpart as a spleen on the right, so these\r\ntwo organs (the liver and spleen) must themselves correspond to each\r\nother, and as such, express their respective significations. Under the\r\nbelief that every exception (even though it be normal) to a general law\r\nor rule, is, like the anomaly itself, alone explicable according to such\r\nlaw, and expressing a fact not more singular or isolated from other\r\nparallel facts than is one form from another, or from all others\r\nconstituting the graduated scale of being, I would, according to the\r\nlight of this evidence alone, have no hesitation in stating that the\r\nliver and spleen, as opposites, represent corresponding organs, even\r\nthough they appeared at first view more dissimilar than they really are.\r\nIn support of this analogy of both organs, which is here, so far as I am\r\naware, originally enunciated for anatomical science, I record the\r\nfollowing observations:--1st. Between the opposite parts of the same\r\norganic entity (between the opposite leaves of the same plant, for\r\nexample), nature manifests no such absolute difference in any case as\r\nexists between the leaf of a plant and of a book. 2ndly. When between\r\ntwo opposite parts of the same organic form there appears any\r\ndifferential character, this is simply the result of a modification or\r\nmetamorphosis of one of the two perfectly similar originals or\r\narchetypes, but never carried out to such an extreme degree as to\r\nannihilate all trace of their analogy. 3rdly. The liver and the spleen\r\nare opposite parts; and as such, they are associated by arteries which\r\narise by a single trunk (coeliac axis) from the aorta, and branch right\r\nand left, like indices pointing to the relationship between both these\r\norgans, in the same manner as the two emulgent arteries point to the\r\nopposite renal organs. 4thly. The liver is divided into two lobes, right\r\nand left; the left is less than the right; that quantity which is\r\nwanting to the left lobe is equal to the quantity of a spleen; and if in\r\nidea we add the spleen to the left lobe of the liver, both lobes of this\r\norgan become quantitatively equal, and the whole liver symmetrical;\r\nhence, as the liver plus the spleen represents the whole structural\r\nquantity, so the liver minus the spleen signifies that the two organs\r\nnow dissevered still relate to each other as parts of the same whole.\r\n5thly. The liver, as being three-fourths of the whole, possesses the\r\nduct which emanates at the centre of all glandular bodies. The spleen,\r\nas being one-fourth of the whole, is devoid of the duct. The liver\r\nhaving the duct, is functional as a gland, while the spleen having no\r\nduct, cannot serve any such function. If, in thus indicating the\r\nfunction which the spleen does not possess, there appears no proof\r\npositive of the function which it does, perhaps the truth is, that as\r\nbeing the ductless portion of the whole original hepatic quantity, it\r\nexists as a thing degenerate and functionless, for it seems that the\r\nanimal economy suffers no loss of function when deprived of it. 6thly.\r\nIn early foetal life, the left lobe of the liver touches the spleen on\r\nthe left side; but in the process of abdominal development, the two\r\norgans become separated from each other right and left. 7thly. In\r\nanimals devoid of the spleen, the liver appears of a symmetrical shape,\r\nboth its lobes being equal; for that quantity which in other animals has\r\nbecome splenic, is in the former still hepatic. 8thly. In cases of\r\ntransposition of both organs, it is the right lobe of the liver--that\r\nnearest the spleen, now on the right side--which is the smaller of the\r\ntwo lobes, proving that whichever lobe be in this condition, the spleen,\r\nas being opposite to it, represents the minus hepatic quantity. From\r\nthese, among other facts, I infer that the spleen is the representative\r\nof the liver on the left side, and that as such, its signification being\r\nmanifest, there exists no exception to the law of animal symmetry. \"Tam\r\nmiram uniformitatem in planetarum systemate, necessario fatendum est\r\nintelligentia et concilio fuisse effectam. Idemque dici possit de\r\nuniformitate illa quae est in corporibus animalium.

The vasa cordis form an anastomotic circulation altogether\r\nisolated from the vessels of the other thoracic organs, and also from\r\nthose distributed to the thoracic parietes. The coronary arteries are\r\naccompanied by veins which open by distinct orifices (foramina Thebesii)\r\ninto the right auricle. Like the heart itself, its main vessels do not\r\ndepend for their support upon the blood conveyed by them, but upon that\r\ncirculated by the small arteries (vasa vasorum) derived either from the\r\nvessel upon which they are distributed, or from some others in the\r\nneighbourhood. These little arteries are attended by veins of a\r\ncorresponding size (venules) which enter the venae comites, thus\r\ncarrying out the general order of vascular distribution to the minutest\r\nparticular. Besides the larger nerves which accompany the main vessels,\r\nthere are delicate filaments of the cerebro-spinal and sympathetic\r\nsystem distributed to their coats, for the purpose, as it is supposed,\r\nof governing their \"contractile movements.\" The vasa vasorum form an\r\nanastomosis as well upon the inner surface of the sheath as upon the\r\nartery contained in this part; and hence in the operation for tying the\r\nvessel, the rule should be to disturb its connexions as little as\r\npossible, otherwise its vitality, which depends upon these minute\r\nbranches, will, by their rupture, be destroyed in the situation of the\r\nligature, where it is most needed.\r\n\r\nXI.--The branches of the systemic aorta form frequent anastomoses with\r\neach other in all parts of the body. This anastomosis occurs chiefly\r\namongst the branches of the main arteries proper to either side. Those\r\nbranches of the opposite vessels which join at the median line are\r\ngenerally of very small size. There are but few instances in which a\r\nlarge blood vessel crosses the central line from its own side to the\r\nother. Anastomosis at the median line between opposite vessels happens\r\neither by a fusion of their sides lying parallel, as for example (and\r\nthe only one) that of the two vertebral arteries on the basilar process\r\nof the occipital bone; or else by a direct end-to-end union, of which\r\nthe lateral pair of cerebral arteries, forming the circle of Willis, and\r\nthe two labial arteries, forming the coronary, are examples. The\r\nbranches of the main arteries of one side form numerous anastomoses in\r\nthe muscles and in the cellular and adipose tissue generally. Other\r\nspecial branches derived from the parent vessel above and below the\r\nseveral joints ramify and anastomose so very freely over the surfaces of\r\nthese parts, and seem to pass in reference to them out of their direct\r\ncourse, that to effect this mode of distribution appears to be no less\r\nimmediate a design than to support the structures of which the joints\r\nare composed.\r\n\r\nXII.--The innominate artery. When this vessel is tied, the free direct\r\ncirculation through the principal arteries of the right arm, and the\r\nright side of the neck, head, and brain, becomes arrested; and the\r\ndegree of strength of the recurrent circulation depends solely upon the\r\namount of anastomosing points between the following arteries of the\r\nopposite sides. The small terminal branches of the two occipital, the\r\ntwo auricular, the two superficial temporal, and the two frontal,\r\ninosculate with each other upon the sides, and over the vertex of the\r\nhead; the two vertebral, and the branches of the internal carotid, at\r\nthe base and over the surface of the brain; the two facial with each\r\nother, and with the frontal above and mental below, at the median line\r\nof the face; the two internal maxillary by their palatine, pharyngeal,\r\nmeningeal, and various other branches upon the surface of the parts to\r\nwhich they are distributed; and lastly, the two superior thyroid\r\narteries inosculate around the larynx and in the thyroid body. By these\r\nanastomoses, it will be seen that the circulation is restored to the\r\nbranches of the common carotid almost solely. In regard to the\r\nsubclavian artery, the circulation would be carried on through the\r\nanastomosing branches of the two inferior thyroid in the thyroid body;\r\nof the two vertebral, in the cranium and upon the cervical vertebrae; of\r\nthe two internal mammary, with each other behind the sternum, and with\r\nthe thoracic branches of the axillary and the superior intercostal\r\nlaterally; lastly, through the anastomosis of the ascending cervical\r\nwith the descending branch of the occipital, and with the small lateral\r\noffsets of the vertebral.\r\n\r\nXIII.--The common carotid arteries, Of these two vessels, the left one\r\narising, in general, from the arch of the aorta, is longer than the\r\nright one by the measure of the innominate artery from which the right\r\narises. When either of the common carotids is tied, the circulation will\r\nbe maintained through the anastomosing branches of the opposite vessels\r\nas above specified. When the vertebral or the inferior thyroid branch\r\narises from the middle of the common carotid, this vessel will have an\r\nadditional source of supply if the ligature be applied to it below the\r\norigin of such branch. In the absence of the innominate artery, the\r\nright as well as the left carotid will be found to spring directly from\r\nthe aortic arch.\r\n\r\nXIV.--The subclavian arteries. When a ligature is applied to the inner\r\nthird of this vessel within its primary branches, the collateral\r\ncirculation is carried on by the anastomoses of the arteries above\r\nmentioned; but if the vertebral or the inferior thyroid arises either\r\nfrom the aorta or the common carotid, the sources of arterial supply in\r\nrespect to the arm will, of course, be less numerous. When the outer\r\nportion of the subclavian is tied between the scalenus and the clavicle,\r\nwhile the branches arise from its inner part in their usual position and\r\nnumber, the collateral circulation in reference to the arm is maintained\r\nby the following anastomosing branches:--viz., those of the\r\nsuperficialis colli, and the supra and posterior scapular, with those of\r\nthe acromial thoracic; the subscapular, and the anterior and posterior\r\ncircumflex around the shoulder-joint, and over the dorsal surface of\r\nthe scapula; and those of the internal mammary and superior intercostal,\r\nwith those of the thoracic arteries arising from the axillary. Whatever\r\nbe the variety as to their mode or place of origin, the branches\r\nemanating from the subclavian artery are constant as to their\r\ndestination. The length of the inner portion of the right subclavian\r\nwill vary according to the place at which it arises, whether from the\r\ninnominate artery, from the ascending, or from the descending part of\r\nthe aortic arch.\r\n\r\nXV.--The axillary artery. As this vessel gives off throughout its whole\r\nlength, numerous branches which inosculate principally with the\r\nscapular, mammary, and superior intercostal branches of the subclavian,\r\nit will be evident that, in tying it above its own branches, the\r\nanastomotic circulation will with much greater freedom be maintained in\r\nrespect to the arm, than if the ligature be applied below those\r\nbranches. Hence, therefore, when the axillary artery is affected with\r\naneurism, thereby rendering it unsafe to apply a ligature to this\r\nvessel, it becomes not only pathologically, but anatomically, the more\r\nprudent measure to tie the subclavian immediately above the clavicle.\r\n\r\nXVI.--The brachial artery, When this artery is tied immediately below\r\nthe axilla, the collateral circulation will be weakly maintained, in\r\nconsequence of the small number of anastomosing branches arising from it\r\nabove and below the seat of the ligature. The two circumflex humeri\r\nalone send down branches to inosculate with the small muscular offsets\r\nfrom the middle of the brachial artery. When tied in the middle of the\r\narm between the origins of the superior and inferior profunda arteries,\r\nthe collateral circulation will depend chiefly upon the anastomosis of\r\nthe former vessel with the recurrent branch of the radial, and of\r\nmuscular branches with each other. When the ligature is applied to the\r\nlower third of the vessel, the collateral circulation will be\r\ncomparatively free through the anastomoses of the two profundi and\r\nanastomotic branches with the radial, interosseous, and ulnar recurrent\r\nbranches. If the artery happen to divide in the upper part of the arm\r\ninto either of the branches of the forearm, or into all three, a\r\nligature applied to any one of them will, of course, be insufficient to\r\narrest the direct circulation through the forearm, if this be the object\r\nin view.\r\n\r\nXVII.--The radial artery. If this vessel be tied in any part of its\r\ncourse, the collateral circulation will depend principally upon the free\r\ncommunications between it and the ulnar, through the medium of the\r\nsuperficial and deep palmar arches and those of the  branches derived\r\nfrom both vessels, and from the two interossei distributed to the\r\nfingers and back of the hand.\r\n\r\nXVIII.--The ulnar artery. When this vessel is tied, the collateral\r\ncirculation will depend upon the anastomosis of the palmar arches, as in\r\nthe case last mentioned. While the radial, ulnar, and interosseous\r\narteries spring from the same main vessel, and are continuous with each\r\nother in the hand, they represent the condition of a circle of which,\r\nwhen either side is tied, the blood will pass in a current of almost\r\nequal strength towards the seat of the ligature from above and below--a\r\ncircumstance which renders it necessary to tie both ends of the vessel\r\nin cases of wounds.\r\n\r\nXIX.--The common iliac artery. When a ligature is applied to the middle\r\nof this artery, the direct circulation becomes arrested in the lower\r\nlimb and side of the pelvis corresponding to the vessel operated on. The\r\ncollateral circulation will then be carried on by the anastomosis of the\r\nfollowing branches--viz., those of the lumbar, the internal mammary, and\r\nthe epigastric arteries of that side with each other, and with their\r\nfellows in the anterior abdominal parietes; those of the middle and\r\nlateral sacral; those of the superior with the middle and inferior\r\nhaemorrhoidal; those of the aortic and internal iliac uterine branches\r\nin the female; and of the aortic and external iliac spermatic branches\r\nin the male. The anastomoses of these arteries with their opposite\r\nfellows along the median line, are much less frequent than those of the\r\narteries of the neck and head.\r\n\r\nXX.--The external iliac artery. This vessel, when tied at its middle,\r\nwill have its collateral circulation carried on by the anastomoses of\r\nthe internal mammary with the epigastric; by those of the ilio-lumbar\r\nwith the circumflex ilii; those of the internal circumflex femoris, and\r\nsuperior perforating arteries of the profunda femoris, with the\r\nobturator, when this branch arises from the internal iliac; those of the\r\ngluteal with the external circumflex; those of the latter with the\r\nsciatic; and those of both obturators, with each other, when\r\narising--the one from the internal, the other from the external iliac.\r\nNot unfrequently either the epigastric, obturator, ilio-lumbar, or\r\ncircumflex ilii, arises from the middle of the external iliac, in which\r\ncase the ligature should be placed above such branch.\r\n\r\nXXI.--The common femoral artery. On considering the circles of\r\ninosculation formed around the innominate bone between the branches\r\nderived from the iliac arteries near the sacro-iliac junction, and those\r\nemanating from the common femoral, above and below Poupart's ligament,\r\nit will at once appear that, in respect to the lower limb, the\r\ncollateral circulation will occur more freely if the ligature be applied\r\nto the main vessel (external iliac) than if to the common femoral below\r\nits branches.\r\n\r\nXXII.--The superficial femoral artery. When a ligature is applied to\r\nthis vessel at the situation where it is overlapped by the sartorius\r\nmuscle, the collateral circulation will be maintained by the following\r\narteries:--the long descending branches of the external circumflex\r\nbeneath the rectus muscle, inosculate with the muscular branches of the\r\nanastomotica magna springing from the lower third of the main vessel;\r\nthe three perforating branches of the profunda inosculate with the\r\nlatter vessel, with the sciatic, and with the articular and muscular\r\nbranches around the knee-joint.\r\n\r\nXXIII.--The popliteal artery. When any circumstance renders it necessary\r\nto tie this vessel in preference to the femoral, the ligature should be\r\nplaced above its upper pair of articular branches; for by so doing a\r\nfreer collateral circulation will take place in reference to the leg.\r\nThe ligature in this situation will lie between the anastomotic and\r\narticular arteries, which freely communicate with each other.\r\n\r\nXXIV.--The anterior and posterior tibial and peronoeal arteries. As\r\nthese vessels correspond to the arteries of the forearm, the\r\nobservations which apply to the one set apply also to the other.\r\n[Footnote]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: For a complete history of the general vascular system, see\r\nThe Anatomy of the Arteries of the Human Body, by Richard Quain, F.R.S.,\r\n&c., in which work, besides the results of the author's own great\r\nexperience and original observations, will be found those of Haller's,\r\nScarpa's, Tiedemann's, &c., systematically arranged with a view to\r\noperative surgery.]\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
