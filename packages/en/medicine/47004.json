The influence of the past on the present is greater\r\nthan we commonly suppose. In this age of rapid scientific progress\r\nand brilliant research, we are apt to overlook and lose sight of the\r\npatient labours of the early pioneers of science, many of whom laid the\r\nfoundations of discoveries that have since proved of inestimable value\r\nto mankind. Hence the history of the past, whether in science or in\r\nart, is always worthy of study and attention.\r\n\r\nMy thanks are due to the Editor of the _Pharmaceutical Journal_ for\r\npermission to reproduce several illustrations which appeared in its\r\npages together with a portion of this work.\r\n\r\n      C.

The instinct that first led man to utilise the fruits of the\r\nearth for his bodily sustenance, may perchance have suggested the herbs\r\nwhich grew around him as a means of alleviating the ills of his flesh.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of doubt whether medicine as an art was first practised\r\nin Egypt or China; from recent research probably the former, as at the\r\ntime of the writing of the _Ebers Papyrus_, B.C. 1550, the Egyptians\r\nhad a considerable knowledge of the use of herbs and other bodies for\r\nmedicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nThe art of medicine had two foundations—empiricism and\r\nsuperstition—which have influenced it from its birth down to the\r\npresent time.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient record of medicine and pharmacy known was discovered\r\nat Kahun in 1889, near the pyramid of Illahun in the ruins of an\r\nancient town, which had apparently been inhabited by the builders of\r\nthe pyramid. It dates from the twelfth dynasty, B.C. 2700 to 2500, more\r\nthan a thousand years before the Exodus.\r\n\r\nBesides containing instructions for midwives, it includes numerous\r\nformulæ for the treatment of various complaints, composed of such very\r\nhomely articles as beer, cow’s milk, honey, oil, onions, herbs, dates,\r\nand other fruits.\r\n\r\nThe _Ebers Papyrus_, which was found reposing between the legs of a\r\nmummy, throws a light on ancient Egyptian pharmacy, and was written in\r\nthe reign of King Amenhotep I., of the eighteenth dynasty. It commences\r\nas follows: “Beginning of the chapter of applying medicaments to every\r\npart of the patient.\r\n\r\n“I have come forth from Heliopolis with the mighty ones of the Temple\r\nof the Sun, the wielders of protection, the princes of eternity.\r\n\r\n“Rescuing (?) I have come forth from Sais with the Mothers of the Gods,\r\nwho have given me their protection.\r\n\r\n“I have magic formulæ made by the Universal Lord to drive out the\r\nstroke of god and goddess, the Male Death and Female Death, _et\r\ncetera_,[1] that is in this my head, in this my neck, in this\r\nmy shoulder, in this my flesh, in these my limbs, to punish the\r\nabove-named enchanters (?) who introduce disturbance into this my\r\nflesh.”\r\n\r\n        [1] Etc. is probably a direction _ad lib._ for the doctor\r\n        speaking the formulæ.\r\n\r\nSuch formulæ, evidently for recitation during the treatment, continue\r\nfor a page and a half. The book has thus no general title, but plunges\r\nat once into the mysteries of the profession.\r\n\r\n“Beginning of the mystery of the physician who knows the motion of\r\nthe heart. There are vessels in it to every limb. When any physician,\r\ndoctor, or amulet-maker puts his fingers upon the top of the head, upon\r\nthe occiput, upon the hands, upon the chest, upon the arms, upon the\r\nlegs, he communicates (?) with the heart, for its vessels extend to\r\nevery limb, wherefore it is called the starting-point of every limb.”\r\n\r\nThe following may be taken as an example of the recipes given in the\r\nmanuscript:—\r\n\r\n“A remedy for the belly that is painful: Cummin 1∕64 hin, goose-grease\r\n1∕8 hin, milk 1∕16 hekt; cool, strain, and drink”. The hin is about 29\r\ncubic inches, and the 1∕16 hekt 18 cubic inches; the prescription is\r\nthus roundly 1∕2 cubic inch of cummin, and 4 of goose fat, in half a\r\npint of milk.\r\n\r\nThis papyrus contains 110 pages, each page consisting of about\r\ntwenty-two lines of bold Hieratic writing. It may be described as an\r\nencyclopædia of medicine as known and practised by the Egyptians of\r\nthe eighteenth dynasty, and it contains prescriptions of all kinds of\r\ndiseases—some borrowed from Syrian medical lore, and some of such\r\ngreat antiquity that they are ascribed to the mythological ages,\r\nwhen the gods yet reigned personally on earth. Among others is given\r\nthe recipe for an application whereby Osiris cured Ra of a headache.\r\nIn this papyrus is an example of an old Egyptian diagnosis and\r\ntherapeutics, as follows: “When thou findest any one with a hardness\r\nin his re-hit (pit of the stomach), and when, after eating, he feels\r\na pressure on his intestines, his hit is swollen and he feels bad in\r\nwalking like one who suffers from heat in his back, then observe him\r\nwhen he lies stretched out, and if thou findest his intestines hot and\r\na hardness in his re-hit, say unto thyself, This is a disease of the\r\nliver. Then prepare for thyself according to the secrets of the science\r\nfrom the plant pa-che-test and dates, mix them, and give in water.”\r\n\r\nIt also contains numerous recipes for the treatment of diseases, for\r\ninternal and external use. Most of the drugs mentioned are derived from\r\nindigenous plants, and such chemical bodies as alum, salt, nitre, and\r\nsulphate of copper are included in some of the prescriptions.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that most of the medicines used in these early\r\ntimes were first tried as foods; and those which when taken in large\r\nquantities or in special conditions influenced the functions of the\r\nbody, these and others found to be too strong for dietetic use were\r\nrelegated to the books of medicine.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of this, the leaves and seeds of the castor oil plant\r\nand the astringent sycamore fig are included in many recipes, but\r\nMaspero states that there is little doubt that castor oil was taken\r\nregularly in food in the time of the Pharaohs, and at the present time\r\nit is a favourite adjunct to the salads of the Egyptian fellaheen.\r\nThe same writer thinks the Egyptians began by eating every kind of\r\nfood which the country produced, and so became acquainted with their\r\ntherapeutic properties.\r\n\r\nIn another papyrus said to have been written about the time of King\r\nChata of the first dynasty, who reigned B.C. 4000, the following\r\nprescription for promoting the growth of the hair is given:—\r\n\r\n  Pad of a dog’s foot                1\r\n  Fruit of date palm                 1\r\n  Ass’s hoof                         1\r\n              Boil together in oil.\r\n\r\nDr. v. Oefele states of pharmacy before the time of Hippocrates, that\r\nalthough the practice of medicine was not separated from pharmacy among\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, there was such a separation among the ancient\r\nEgyptians, from whom the distinction was handed down to the Copts,\r\nand by them to the Arabians; and, in fact, that the term pharmacist\r\nis probably of Egyptian origin, being derived from Ph-ar-maki, which\r\nsignifies the preparation of medicine from drugs. The Egyptian pharmaki\r\nwho were engaged in that occupation belonged to the higher social\r\nranks of writers or academically-educated persons, comprising also the\r\npriests, physicians, statesmen, and military commanders.\r\n\r\nThe Jews were indebted to Egypt for their primary ideas of medicine,\r\nbut they cast away the ideas of demonology and magic which clouded\r\nwhat was good in the practice of Egypt. The Talmud recommends onions\r\nfor worms, and wine, pepper, and asafœtida for flatulency. The\r\nTalmudists are responsible for calling the earth, air, fire, and water\r\nelementary bodies. In the middle ages the Jews rendered service to the\r\nhealing art, and had a large share in the scientific work connected\r\nwith the Arab domination of Spain.\r\n\r\nIn China the use of drugs goes back to a very remote age, and alchemy\r\nwas practised by the Chinese long previous to its being known in\r\nEurope. For two centuries prior to the Christian era, and for four or\r\nmore subsequent, the transmutation of the base metals into gold, and\r\nthe composition of the elixir of immortality, were questions ardently\r\nstudied by the Chinese. It is, moreover, a matter of history that\r\nintercourse between China and Persia was frequent both before and\r\nafter the Mahomedan conquest of the latter country; that embassies\r\nfrom Persia as well as from the Arabs, and even from the Greeks in\r\nConstantinople, visited the court of the Chinese emperor in Shansi;\r\nthat Arab traders settled in China, and that there was frequent\r\nintercourse by sea between China and the Persian Gulf; and lastly, that\r\nChina had an extensive alchemical literature anterior to the period\r\nwhen alchemy was studied in the West. All these facts go to prove that\r\nthe ancient science known as alchemy was originated by the Chinese, and\r\nnot by the disciples of Mahomed, who only acquired the knowledge at\r\nsecond hand.[2]\r\n\r\n        [2] Hanbury’s _Notes on Chinese Materia Medica_.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat curious that while the alchemists of the West were\r\nalways in doubt as to what constituted the true Philosopher’s Stone,\r\nthe Chinese seemingly had no doubt as to its identity. Cinnabar was\r\nregarded by the early alchemists and philosophers of that nation as\r\nthe wonderful body which was supposed to have the mysterious power\r\nof converting other metals into gold, and when used as a medicine\r\nwould prolong life for an indefinite period. Ko-hung, author of the\r\n_Pau-p’uh-tsi p’ian_, a work of the fourth century, and undoubtedly\r\ngenuine, gives various mineral and vegetable productions possessing in\r\ndifferent degrees the properties of an elixir vitæ. In one paragraph of\r\nthis work he states: “When vegetable matter is burnt it is destroyed,\r\nbut when the Ian-sha (Cinnabar) is subjected to heat it produces\r\nmercury. After passing through other changes it returns to its original\r\nform. It differs widely, therefore, from vegetable substances, and\r\nhence it has the power of making men live for ever and raising them to\r\nthe rank of the genii. He who knows the doctrine, is he not far above\r\ncommon men, etc.?”\r\n\r\nIn _materia medica_ the knowledge of the Chinese was much in\r\nadvance of the nations of the West, and their great herbal, entitled\r\n_Pun-Isaun-Kang-Mûh_, written by Le-she-chin in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century, shows the discernment possessed by these curious\r\npeople. This work consists of forty thin octavo volumes, the first\r\nthree of which contain woodcuts of many of the minerals, plants, and\r\nanimals referred to in the text. The woodcuts alone number 1100, and\r\nthe work itself is divided into fifty-two divisions. The antiquity\r\nof the practice of medicine among the Chinese may be gathered from\r\nthe fact that there exists a work entitled _A Treatise from the Heart\r\non the Small-pox_, which was written during the dynasty of Icheon,\r\nB.C. 1122. In this work the eruption is described, and some kind of\r\ninoculation is also referred to as a remedy.\r\n\r\nBut it is to Greece that we have to look for the birth of medical art\r\nin the West, its practice by the priests being of great antiquity.\r\nThe earliest record of a temple of medicine is of one erected in the\r\nPeloponnesus in the year B.C. 1130, or about fifty years after the fall\r\nof Troy. Other temples or centres of the healing art gradually sprang\r\nup, and round each of those clustered a little school of students.\r\nThere were the temple of Health at Pergamus, the temple of Hygeia at\r\nCytea, and the temples of Æsculapius at Cos and Epidamus, where the\r\nfamous statue of Æsculapius stood. The father of ancient medicine,\r\nHippocrates, graduated as a student of Cos, and Galen is said to have\r\nbeen at Epidamus.\r\n\r\nIt was in the temple of Æsculapius at Greece that any record of\r\nmedicine was first kept, the names of diseases and their cures being\r\nregistered on tablets of marble. The priests and priestesses, who were\r\nthe guardians of the temple, prepared the remedies and directed their\r\napplication, and thus commenced the practice of physic as a regular\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThese official persons were ambitious to pass as the legitimate\r\ndescendants of Æsculapius, and therefore assumed the title of\r\nthe Asclepiades. The writings of Pausanius, Plutarch, and others\r\nabound with accounts of the artifices of these early practitioners.\r\nAristophanes mentions the dexterity and promptitude with which they\r\ncollected and put into their bags the offerings on the altar.\r\n\r\nThe patients were wont to repose on the skins of sacrificed rams in\r\norder to procure celestial visions. As soon as they were supposed to\r\nbe asleep, a priest, clothed in the dress of Æsculapius, imitating his\r\nmanner, and accompanied by the daughters of the god (that is, by young\r\nactresses well up in their parts), entered and solemnly delivered a\r\nmedical opinion. The student sat at the feet of the philosopher of his\r\nchoice, and after a certain period and course of probation, was granted\r\nthe rights of priest and physician to practise as a teacher and healer.\r\n\r\nThey had their code and ethics of a standard almost equal to those of\r\nto-day, and their knowledge of surgery, and the use of the herbs and\r\nplants which grew around them, was not a little.\r\n\r\nEntering on their novitiate at their chosen temple or school, they were\r\nrequired to make a protestation or oath, of which the following is the\r\none made by Hippocrates:—\r\n\r\n“I, Hippocrates, do now promise and protest to the great god Apollo\r\nand his two daughters Hygeia and Panadie, and also to all the gods and\r\ngoddesses, to observe the contents of this oath or tables wherein the\r\noath is carved, written, or engraved, so far as I can possibly, and so\r\nfar as my wit or understanding shall be able to direct me, _viz._, I\r\nyield myself tributary and debtor to the master and doctor, who hath\r\ninstructed me and showed me this science and doctrine, even as much\r\nor rather more than to my father who hath begotten me, and that I\r\nshall live and communicate with him, and follow him in all necessities\r\nwhich I shall know him to have, so far as my power shall permit and\r\nmy goods extend. Also that I shall love and cherish his children as\r\nmy brother’s, and his progeny as my own. Further, that I shall teach,\r\nshow and demonstrate the said science without reward or covenant, and\r\nthat I shall give all the canons, rules and precepts freely, truly and\r\nfaithfully to my master, his children as to my own, without hiding or\r\nunacting anything, and to all other scholars who shall make the same\r\noath or protestation, and to no others. Also that in practising and\r\nusing my science towards the sick, I shall use only things necessary,\r\nso far as I am able, and as my spirit and good understanding shall\r\ngive unto me, and that I shall cure the sick as speedily as I may\r\nwithout dilating or prolonging the malady, and that I shall not do\r\nanything against equity for hatred, anger, envy or malice to any\r\nperson whatsoever. Moreover, that I shall minister no poison, neither\r\ncounsel nor teach poison, nor the composing thereof to any. Also that\r\nI shall not give nor cause to be given, nor contend that anything be\r\napplied to a woman breeding, to destroy and make her void her fruit.\r\nBut I shall protest to keep my life and science purely, sincerely and\r\ninviolably, without deceit, fraud or guile. And that I shall not cut\r\nor incise any person having the stone, but shall leave the same to\r\nthose who are expert in it. And, furthermore, that I shall not enter\r\ninto the patient’s house lest with purpose to heal him, and that I\r\nshall patiently sustain the injuries, reproaches, and loathsomeness of\r\nsick men and other base railings, and that I shall eschew, as far as\r\nI may, all venereous lasciviousness. Moreover, I protest, be it man,\r\nwoman, or servant who is my patient, to cure them of all things, that\r\nI may see or hear either in mind or manner, and I shall not betray\r\nthat which should be concealed or hidden, but keep inviolable with\r\nsilence; neither reveal any creature under pain of death. And therefore\r\nI beseech our gods that observing this protestation, promise, and vow\r\nentirely and inviolably, all things in my life, in my art, and science,\r\nmay succeed securely, healthfully, and prosperously to me, and in the\r\nend eternal glory.\r\n\r\n“And to him that shall violate, transgress, or become perjured, that\r\nthe contrary may happen unto him, _viz._, misery, calamities, and\r\ncontinual maladies.”\r\n\r\nWe have here principles laid down which would do honour to any medical\r\nbody, and which show the highly civilised condition and the excellent\r\nmoral teaching of the early Greek philosophers and priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARDS OF EARLY GREECE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest magicians or soothsayers of which we have record\r\nout of the era of mythology was Tiresias. He lived in the times of\r\nŒdipus and the war of the seven chiefs against Thebes. For having\r\noffended the gods he was visited with blindness, but being repentant,\r\ntradition states they recompensed him for this affliction by endowing\r\nhim with the gift of prophecy and the act of divination. He is also\r\nsaid to have been able to hold communion with the feathered world, and\r\nto have power over the spirits of the dead, whom he could compel to\r\nappear and reply to his inquiries. His incantations and spells were\r\nsupposed to be irresistible, and he could foretell future events by\r\nsigns from fire, smoke, and other methods of divining.\r\n\r\nAbaris, a native of Scythia, was another magician of renown. There is\r\nno exact record of the time in which he lived, but he is represented\r\nby some as having constructed the Palladium which protected Troy from\r\nits enemies for a long time. Other authors declare he was a friend of\r\nPythagoras, who flourished some 600 years later.\r\n\r\nAccording to Herodotus, he travelled over the world with an arrow,\r\neating nothing during his journey. By others it is said the arrow was\r\npresented to him by Apollo, and that upon it he rode through the air,\r\nand travelled over lands, seas, mountains, and other inaccessible\r\nplaces. But from all accounts his repute as a magician and seer is\r\nconfirmed. He is said to have foretold earthquakes, allayed storms and\r\npestilence, cured disease by charms and incantations, and was generally\r\nrevered for his power and command over the dwellers in the unseen world.\r\n\r\nPythagoras, one of the most notable magicians in early history, was\r\nborn about the year B.C. 586, and lived during the time of Cyrus and\r\nDarius Hystaspes, of Crœsus, of Pisistratus, of Polycrates, and\r\nAmasis King of Egypt. He was renowned not only as a philosopher but as\r\na leader and politician, and was learned in all branches of science\r\nthen known. The early part of his life was spent in Egypt, but he also\r\ntravelled in order to gather experience and knowledge until he reached\r\nthe age of forty years.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he founded a school, where he lectured and instructed\r\na large number of followers who were attracted by his wisdom and\r\nlearning. He divided his pupils into two classes: the neophytes, to\r\nwhom were explained the elementary and general principles of his\r\nphilosophy, while the advanced were admitted into his entire confidence\r\nand formed a brotherhood, who threw their property into a common stock\r\nand lived together.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of his life he is said to have lived in Magna\r\nGræcia, where he carried on his studies and made some of his great\r\ndiscoveries. He was a profound geometrician, and two great theorems,\r\none still known as the Pythagorean, are ascribed to him. He propounded\r\nthe doctrine that the earth is a planet of spherical form, and the sun\r\nthe centre of the planetary system.\r\n\r\nHis philosophy prescribed and taught a total abstinence from everything\r\nwhich had animal life, and temperance in all things, together with the\r\nsubjection of the appetites of the body. By this strict discipline,\r\nhe seems to have obtained almost complete control over the wills and\r\nminds of his followers, from whom he demanded the utmost docility.\r\nPreparatory to entering on his novitiate, the pupil was strictly\r\nexamined by the master as to his principles, habits, and intentions.\r\nThe tone of his voice, his manner of speaking, his walk, gestures,\r\nand the lines of his face and the expression of his eyes, were all\r\ncarefully observed, and only if all these features were satisfactory\r\nwas he admitted as a probationer. After this interview the master\r\nwithdrew from the sight of the pupil, who could then enter on his\r\nnovitiate of three and five, in all eight years, during which time he\r\nwas not permitted to look on the master, but only hear him speak from\r\nbehind a curtain, and he was enjoined to preserve the strictest silence.\r\n\r\nTo add to his mystery and authority, Pythagoras is said to have hid\r\nhimself during the day from his pupils, and was only visible to them\r\nafter the night had come on. He is described as having a most imposing\r\nand majestic appearance, with a grave and awe-inspiring countenance.\r\nWhen he came forth he appeared in a long garment of the purest white,\r\nwith his long beard flowing, and a garland upon his head.\r\n\r\nHe allowed his followers to believe he was one of the gods, and he is\r\nsaid to have told Abaris that he resumed human form so that he might\r\nwin the confidence of man.\r\n\r\nDoubtless, owing to his great attainments and his superiority to\r\nthe men of his time, he considered himself more divine than human,\r\nand he claimed to have miraculous endowments. Those who were not of\r\nhis followers ascribed the stories related of him to magic, which\r\nprobably, like other philosophers, he studied.\r\n\r\nAmong other stories which tradition has handed down concerning\r\nPythagoras are the following: He professed to have appeared in\r\ndifferent ages in various human forms—first as Æthalides, the son of\r\nMercury, and then as Euphorbu, who slew Patroclus at the siege of Troy,\r\nand as other individuals also.\r\n\r\nHe is said to have tamed a bear by whispering in its ear, and prevailed\r\non it to feed on vegetables alone. He called also an eagle down from\r\nits flight, causing it to sit on his hand as if quite tame. When Abaris\r\naddressed him as one of the heavenly host, he convinced him that he was\r\nindeed a celestial being by showing him his thigh of gold, which also\r\nhe exhibited to sceptical pupils. At another period he absented himself\r\nfrom his associates in Italy for a year: when he re-appeared he stated\r\nhe had been sojourning in the infernal regions, and gave them wonderful\r\ndescriptions of the strange things he had seen there.\r\n\r\nThese and many other fabulous stories are related of this singular man,\r\nwhich prove him to have been as wily as he was wise.\r\n\r\nOne curious rule by which he bound his pupils is worth mentioning.\r\nAt the end of their novitiate, if it was discovered that their\r\nintellectual faculties were too weak to grapple with the intricacies\r\nof his theories and problems, they were expelled the community; the\r\ndouble of the property they had contributed to the common stock was\r\nrefunded to them; a monument inscribed with their names was placed in\r\nthe meeting-place of the community, and they were considered as dead by\r\nthe brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine with what feelings these measures would be\r\nregarded by some who were called to submit to them, and so they\r\neventually proved the cause of the break-up of the Pythagorean school.\r\n\r\nCylon, a man of great wealth of Crotona, conceived a great partiality\r\nfor Pythagoras, and became a novice with Perialus, and submitted to\r\nall the severities of the school. They passed through the three years\r\nof probation and five years of silence, and were received into the\r\nfamiliarity of the master. But after they had delivered their wealth\r\ninto the common stock, Pythagoras pronounced them to be deficient in\r\nintellectual power, or for some other reason most probably they were\r\nexpelled. A tablet inscribed with their names was set up, and they were\r\npronounced dead to the school.\r\n\r\nCylon, who was a man of excitable and violent temperament, became\r\nhighly incensed at this treatment, and resolved on vengeance.\r\nCollecting a band of followers, which probably included a large number\r\nof rejected students, they surrounded the school of the master and set\r\nit on fire. Forty people are said to have perished in the flames, but\r\nPythagoras with two of his pupils escaped to Metapontum, where he took\r\nrefuge in the Temple of the Muses. The strife fomented by Cylon broke\r\nout afresh, and he was closely besieged in the temple by his enemies.\r\nThe rioting continued, and as no provisions could be conveyed to him,\r\nhe finally perished with hunger, according to Laertius, after forty\r\ndays’ abstinence.\r\n\r\nThus ended Pythagoras, a man of undoubted genius, and in knowledge\r\nmuch in advance of his time. Although his teachings were mixed up with\r\nconsiderable artifice and deception, he ranks, as one of the greatest\r\nof the Greek philosophers.\r\n\r\nEpimenides was a native of Crete, and probably lived before the time of\r\nPythagoras. He was credited with marvellous performances from a very\r\nearly age, and is said when quite a lad to have retired to a cave and\r\nslept for fifty-seven years. He then returned to his father’s house,\r\nwhich he found in the possession of a new tenant, and the family\r\ndisappeared. At length he came across his brother, who had grown into\r\nan old man, who after some time acknowledged him.\r\n\r\nOn this story becoming known, he was accounted a favourite of the gods,\r\nand he professed to be endowed with supernatural gifts.\r\n\r\nHe made it known that he was supplied with food by the nymphs, and that\r\nhe was exempt from the usual necessities imposed on the body by Nature.\r\nHe boasted that he could separate his soul from his body and recall it\r\nas he thought fit. He professed to have dealings with the unseen world,\r\nand would exorcise evil spirits or work spells. He had great renown as\r\na seer, and his prophecies were regarded as direct messages from the\r\ngods. But the great act of his life was his delivery of Athens from\r\na great pestilence after the rebellion of Cylon. The plague, which\r\nhad almost decimated the city, could not be stopped, and the Athenian\r\nSenate, after much deliberation, resolved to send for Epimenides,\r\nwho was at that time in Crete. A special vessel was placed under the\r\ncommand of one of the first citizens of the State, who was commissioned\r\nto bring the wise magician.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival at Athens he at once set to work with solemn rites\r\nand ceremonials. He commanded that a number of black and white sheep\r\nshould be led to the Areopagus, then be let loose and allowed to wander\r\nwhither they wished. Certain persons were instructed to follow them\r\nand mark the spot where they lay down, on which place the animal was\r\nsacrificed to the local deity. In this manner, it is recorded, the\r\nplague was stayed. According to some writers he also sacrificed human\r\nvictims. Although pressed by the Athenian Senate to take a recompense\r\nfor his services, Epimenides is said to have refused all gifts,\r\nstipulating only that there should be perpetual peace between the\r\nAthenians and the people of Gnossus, his native city. He died shortly\r\nafterwards, at the reputed age of 157 years.\r\n\r\nEmpedocles was a distinguished magician, orator, and poet, and was\r\nborn in Agrigentum, Sicily. He was a follower of Pythagoras, and\r\nprobably received instruction from his successors. He was credited\r\nwith miraculous powers, and to have been able to restore the dead to\r\nlife. He was skilled in medicine and the use of herbs, and was indeed\r\na general benefactor to the citizens of his native place, where he was\r\nalmost worshipped as a god. Like other philosophers of his time, he was\r\ninordinately vain, but was undoubtedly a man of great intelligence,\r\nand conferred immense benefits on his fellow-creatures. His belief\r\nin the power of magic is shown in the following words he was wont to\r\naddress to his students: “By my instructions you shall learn medicines\r\nthat are powerful to cure disease and reanimate old age; you shall be\r\nable to calm the savage winds which lay waste the labours of all the\r\nhusbandmen, and, when you will, shall send forth the tempest again; you\r\nshall cause the skies to be fair and serene; or, once more, shall draw\r\ndown refreshing showers, reanimating the fruits of the earth; nay, you\r\nshall recall the strength of the dead man when he has already become\r\nthe victim of Pluto”.\r\n\r\nOf himself he said: “I mix with you a god, no longer a mortal, and\r\nam everywhere honoured by you, as is just; crowned with fillets and\r\nfragrant garlands, adorned with which, when I visit populous cities,\r\nI am revered by both men and women, who follow me by ten thousands,\r\ninquiring the road to boundless wealth, seeking the gift of prophecy\r\nand who would learn the marvellous skill to cure all kinds of diseases”.\r\n\r\nOf other wizards of early Greece, Herodotus mentions Aristras, a poet\r\nof Proconnesus, who is said to have mysteriously disappeared from\r\nthe earth for 340 years, and then appeared again at Metapontum and\r\ncommanded the citizens to erect a statue to him. Also Hermotimus, who\r\nwas reputed to have the power of separating his soul from his body\r\nat will. But little is known beyond the merest tradition of these\r\nworthies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARDS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roman philosophers, like the Greeks, claimed to possess occult\r\npowers, and the practitioners of magic and sorcery were numerous\r\nduring the time of the Empire. We have a graphic description of the\r\nincantations of a Roman sorceress in the story of Dido. Deserted by\r\nÆneas, she resolves on self-destruction. To delude her sister as to\r\nher secret purpose she sends for a priestess from the gardens of the\r\nHesperides, pretending that her object is to effect the return of her\r\nlover by means of certain magical incantations. The priestess, who is\r\ninvested with magical powers, can call up the spirits of the dead,\r\ncause the solid earth to rock and quake, and the trees of the forest\r\nto descend from the mountains. On the arrival of the sorceress, she\r\ncommands that a funeral pyre shall be erected in the interior court of\r\nthe palace, and that the arms of Æneas, what remains of his attire, and\r\nthe marriage bed in which Dido had received him, shall be placed upon\r\nit. The pyre is to be hung round with garlands and branches of cypress,\r\nand the whole crowned with a picture of Æneas and his sword.\r\n\r\nAltars were placed around, and the priestess, with dishevelled hair,\r\ncried aloud with terrible charms upon her three hundred gods, upon\r\nErebus, Chaos, and the three-faced Hecate. The waters of Avernus were\r\nthen sprinkled about, and certain magical herbs that had been cut\r\nby moonlight with a sickle of brass. The priestess had with her the\r\nexcrescence which is found upon the forehead of a new-cast foal, of the\r\nsize of a dried fig, a talisman of great power.\r\n\r\nDido is then called upon to approach, and, with her robe drawn up\r\nexposing one bare foot, she makes the circle of the altars, embracing\r\nthem successively, and breaks over each a consecrated cake. The pyre is\r\nlit, and the charm is supposed to be complete.\r\n\r\nBut all the power and the elaborate ritual prescribed by the sorceress\r\nwere of no avail. Æneas returns not, and the broken-hearted Dido\r\nfinally stabs herself and dies.\r\n\r\nMany prodigies are interspersed throughout the early history of Rome,\r\nand most of the acts of these people were surrounded with a halo of\r\nsuperstition natural at the time, and doubtless largely exaggerated.\r\nVirgil, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan all allude to the belief in and the\r\npractice of sorcery and magic by the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth eclogue of Virgil we have a detailed description of a\r\nRoman sorceress. She is introduced by the poet as giving directions to\r\nher assistant as to the working of certain charms. Her object (a common\r\none apparently at that time) is to recall Daphnis, whom she calls her\r\nhusband, to return once more to her arms. The assistant is directed to\r\nburn vervain and frankincense, and the highest efficacy is ascribed\r\nto a solemn chant, which is capable of calling down the moon from its\r\nsphere or making the cold-blooded snake burst in the field, and was the\r\nmeans by which Circe turned the companions of Ulysses into beasts. The\r\nimage of Daphnis is then ordered to be thrice bound round with fillets\r\nof three colours, the assistant at the same time repeating the words,\r\n“Thus I bind the fillets of Venus,” and then paraded about a prepared\r\naltar.\r\n\r\nAn image of clay and one of wax are placed before the same fire; and as\r\nthe image of clay hardens, so does the heart of Daphnis harden towards\r\nhis new mistress; and as the figure of wax softens, so is the heart\r\nof the ex-lover made tender towards the sorceress. A sacred cake is\r\nthen broken over the image, and crackling laurels burnt before it.\r\nShe prays that as the wanton heifer pursues the steer through woods\r\nand glens till at length, worn out with fatigue, she lies down on the\r\noozy reeds by the banks of the stream, and the night dew will not\r\neven drive her away, so Daphnis may be led on after her for ever with\r\ninextinguishable love. The relics of his belongings are then buried\r\nbeneath the threshold. She bruises poisonous herbs of resistless\r\nvirtue, which had been gathered in the kingdom of Pontus, herbs which\r\nenabled him who gave them to turn himself into a hungry wolf prowling\r\namidst the forests, to call up ghosts from the grave, and to translate\r\nthe ripened harvest from the field where it grew to the lands of\r\nanother. The ashes of these herbs are cast over her head into the\r\nrunning stream, while she must not look behind her.\r\n\r\nAt length the sorceress begins to despair and cries, “Daphnis heeds not\r\nmy incantations, heeds not the gods”. She looks again, and perceives\r\nthe ashes on the altar are glowing and emitting sparks of fire. Her\r\nfaithful house dog barks before the door. “Can these things be,” she\r\nexclaims, “or do lovers dream what they desire? It is not so! The real\r\nDaphnis comes; I hear his steps; he has left the deluding town; he\r\nhastens to my longing arms!”\r\n\r\nIn the works of Horace an interesting description of a witches’\r\nincantation is also given, the details of which it is instructive to\r\ncompare with those given by other writers.\r\n\r\nFour sorceresses are assembled in conclave, the chief being Canidia,\r\nwith three assistants, in order to work a charm by means of which a\r\nyouth named Varus, for whom Canidia had conceived a passion, may be\r\ncompelled to reciprocate her affections.\r\n\r\nCanidia, with the locks of her dishevelled hair twined round with\r\nvenomous and deadly serpents, orders the wild fig tree and the funeral\r\ncypress to be rooted up from the sepulchres on which they grew, and\r\nthese, together with the egg of a toad smeared with blood, the plumage\r\nof the screech owl, various herbs brought from Thessaly and Georgia,\r\nand bones torn from the jaws of a famished dog, to be burnt in flames\r\nfed with perfumes from Colchis. One assistant, whose hair stands stiff\r\nand erect like the quills of the sea-hedgehog or the bristles of a\r\nhunted boar, sprinkles the ground with drops from the Avernus, while\r\nanother, who is reputed to have had the faculty of conjuring the stars\r\nand moon down from heaven, assists in other ways.\r\n\r\nThe fourth witch is busy digging a hole with a spade, in which is to\r\nbe plunged up to his chin the beardless youth stripped of his purple\r\nrobe—the emblem of his noble descent—and naked, that from his marrow,\r\nalready dry, and his liver (when at length his eyeballs, long fixed on\r\nthe still renovated food which is withheld from his famished jaws, have\r\nno longer the power to discern), may be concreted the love potion from\r\nwhich the witches promise themselves the most wonderful results.\r\n\r\nCanidia, unmoved by his sufferings, works herself into a great\r\nrage, and calls upon the night and the morn to help in her infamous\r\nincantation. But her victim manages to evade destruction by means\r\nof some magical antidote. She then resolves to prepare a still more\r\npowerful charm, exclaiming, “Sooner shall the sky be swallowed up in\r\nthe sea and the earth be stretched a covering over both, than thou,\r\nmy enemy, shalt not be wrapped in the flames of love as subtle and\r\ntenacious as those of burning pitch”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE FATHERS OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Æsculapius is said to have lived so near to the time of the\r\nTrojan war, yet the Greeks knew very little about him. The superstition\r\nof the time gave him a position among the gods, and as he was adored\r\nunder the character of the genius of physic, it came at last to be\r\ndoubted whether he was ever a mortal; consequently his priests were\r\nobliged for their own sakes to make themselves masters of all the\r\nphysic that the master could teach, that they might be qualified to\r\ngive advice to those who applied to them; their prescriptions passed\r\nfor the suggestions of the gods, the cures for the miraculous. But both\r\ndiseases and remedies were carefully recorded. Strabo tells us that\r\nfrom these registers in the temple of Æsculapius at Cos, Hippocrates\r\nformed his plan for a proper diet.\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the wise physician and father of medicine, was according\r\nto Soranus the son of Heraclides and Phænaretes, descended from\r\nHercules and Æsculapius. He was a Coan by birth, and was first\r\ninstructed by his father, and then by Herodicus, and Democritus of\r\nAbdua, the philosopher. He flourished at the time of the Peloponnesian\r\nwar, and after being instructed in physic and the arts, left his own\r\ncountry for Thessaly, where his fame soon became known, even as far\r\nas Persia. He was sent for by Perdiccás, King of Macedonia, who was\r\nthen thought to be consumptive, but Hippocrates diagnosed it to be a\r\ndisease of the mind, and soon cured the king. He is also said to have\r\ndelivered his own country from a war with the Athenians by prevailing\r\nupon the Thessalians to come to their assistance, for which he received\r\ngreat honours from the Coans. He taught his art with great candour and\r\nliberality to those who were desirous to learn, and at length died full\r\nof honours, it is said, in his ninetieth year, and was buried between\r\nGyrton and Larissa. A quaint old tradition states that at his tomb a\r\nswarm of bees settled and made their honey for a long time, with which\r\nchildren troubled with aphthas, anointed by their nurses at the grave,\r\nwere easily cured.\r\n\r\nHe was by no means covetous of money, but grave in his behaviour and a\r\nlover of Greece, as appears from his curing those of that nation with\r\nthe utmost diligence, and freeing many of their cities from the plague,\r\nfor which he acquired great honours.\r\n\r\nAt first the art of healing was accounted a branch of philosophy, so\r\nthat the cure of diseases and the study of nature owed their rise\r\nto the same persons. Among the many philosophers skilled in the art\r\nthe most celebrated were Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and\r\nHippocrates of Cos. After them came Diodes the Carystian, Praxagoras,\r\nand Chrysippus, with Hierphilus and Erasistratus, many of whom\r\npractised their art in entirely different ways. At this period physic\r\nwas divided into three schools; the first cured by diet, the second\r\nby medicines, the third by manual operations. Those who treated by\r\ndietetic methods endeavoured to extend their views farther with the\r\nassistance of natural philosophy. Then came Serapion, the apostle of\r\npractice and experience, and afterwards Asclepiades, who worked a\r\nrevolution in medical science as then practised.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of both surgery and medicine even in the time of Celsus\r\nis very remarkable, and many of the forms of administration of medicine\r\nare employed at the present day. The enema was largely used by the\r\nancients, a common one being hydromel, described by Dioscorides as\r\nbeing made by mixing two parts of water to one of honey; sea-water was\r\nalso employed for the same purpose, and Celsus recommends the copious\r\ndrinking of hot water as a laxative remedy.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades was the originator of massage and friction, and in his\r\nbook of general remedies describes his treatment, which is similar to\r\nthat performed to-day. Poultices of meal of various descriptions were\r\ncommonly employed, linseed or fenugreek being the favourite media.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades studied in Alexandria, and after practising in Greece\r\nand Asia Minor, finally settled in Rome in the early part of the\r\nfirst century B.C. Here he soon met with success, and established\r\na reputation for great skill. He was the physician and friend of\r\nCicero, and probably also the instructor of Lucretius in the Epicurean\r\nphilosophy, of which he was an enthusiastic advocate.\r\n\r\nHe believed the body to be composed of atoms or particles, with spaces\r\nbetween, through which, like a sieve, various atoms of other shapes\r\nwere continually passing in and out of the body.\r\n\r\nIn practice he believed in curing his patients with as little\r\ndiscomfort as possible, which doubtless helped to make him popular. He\r\nwas averse to the employment of violent remedies and the excessive use\r\nof emetics and purgatives so much favoured by his fellow-practitioners.\r\n\r\nHe advocated the use of music as a soothing agent, and was strongly in\r\nfavour of bathing frequently and of massage.\r\n\r\nHe strongly believed in wine as a remedial agent, which it has been\r\nsaid may have accounted for his popularity with the Roman ladies, with\r\nwhom as a physician he was in great demand. He lived to a very advanced\r\nage, and died it is stated from the effects of a fall.\r\n\r\nGalen, born at Pergamus in the year A.D. 131, studied in the school\r\nof Alexandria, which then had a considerable reputation, and there he\r\nformulated his system of treatment founded on his knowledge of anatomy\r\nand on observation. His fame having spread abroad, he travelled to\r\nRome and became physician to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. According to\r\nGalen, the health of the body depended on an equal and uniform mixture\r\nof solids and liquids, and its sickness arose from their inequality;\r\nconsequently, the physician should foresee illness. He was a profound\r\nstudent of anatomy in his early career, and afterwards turned his\r\nattention to physiology. His views as to inflammation, intermittent\r\nfevers, and his system of antipathies and sympathies, place him very\r\nmuch above his predecessors.\r\n\r\n“In the beginning of the fifth century,” says Lacroix, “the practice of\r\nmedicine, like that of surgery, which was not yet a distinct branch,\r\ncontinued to be free without any authorisation being required. There\r\nwere even women who, like the Druidesses of the Gauls, treated the\r\nsick.” Charmers, unconscious, no doubt, of the occult forces which they\r\nset to work, attempted to cure neuralgic pains, country bone-setters to\r\nmend fractured limbs, while oculists and impostors of the worst kind\r\ntravelled the country.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the close of the eighth century that a regular course\r\nof medical instruction was founded, the first of the kind being\r\norganised at Salerno, in the kingdom of Naples.\r\n\r\nAlexander of Tralles, a noted physician, flourished in the middle of\r\nthe sixth century. No Greek doctor equalled him since the days of\r\nHippocrates in regard to his knowledge of his art in those primitive\r\ndays. He is said to have possessed to a high degree the art of\r\ndiagnosis, and he laid down as a principle, that no decision should\r\nbe arrived at as to the treatment of a case until the specific causes\r\nof disease had been carefully considered. His depreciation of violent\r\naperients, his views on melancholia and gout, and his generally\r\ncommon-sense treatment, stamped him as a man of superior attainments\r\nand ability. He was the first to resort to bleeding from the jugular\r\nvein, and to use iron in certain diseases affecting the blood.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the Roman practitioners of medicine were\r\nill-paid, for it is recorded that Stertimus made some £6500 a year, and\r\nCanie, a surgeon, is said to have received £2000 for one operation,\r\nwhich contrasts well with fees of modern times. Votive offerings for\r\nhealth to the Roman deities were frequent, and sometimes consisted of\r\nland, animals, coin, jewellery, and other articles. Other bribes which\r\nhave been discovered near ancient shrines are terra-cotta figures of\r\ndeities, human beings, animals, and also portions of human anatomy,\r\nsuch as the liver or stomach. This superstition still exists, and is\r\npractised in many parts of Italy, the peasants making votive offerings\r\nsimilar to those of two thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nThe object of offering models of various portions of the body to\r\nspecial deities, was doubtless to propitiate the god to heal that\r\nspecial part in which the patient believed his complaint originated.\r\n\r\nThis custom of making offerings to the gods, called _donaria_ by the\r\nRomans, originated at a very early period. They often took the form\r\nof land, buildings, cattle, tools of trade, jewellery, and cast-off\r\nclothes. Thus the temple of Artemis Brauronia was filled with women’s\r\nclothing. In the temples of the healing gods, instruments of surgery,\r\npharmaceutical appliances, painted tablets representing miraculous\r\nhealings, and great numbers of models of various parts of the human\r\nframe, composed of metal, stone, and terra-cotta, were deposited.\r\n\r\nMany of these ancient temples of healing were magnificent buildings\r\nwith richly-decorated interiors, while others were simply shrines\r\nor grottos at the source of some hot spring or mineral water, where\r\nhundreds of those afflicted with various ailments flocked to bathe or\r\ndrink the water. The priests in charge regulated the use of the waters\r\nand prescribed for the patients. After completing the course it was\r\ncustomary for the patient to throw an offering into the water, in the\r\nform of a silver cup, a coin, or some terra-cotta model of a limb, and\r\nthen drag himself off, muttering a prayer. Others would hang their\r\ngifts on the walls, or deposit them at the feet of the statues of the\r\ngods placed around.\r\n\r\nMagnificent offerings, such as goblets of valuable metal with votive\r\ninscriptions, have been occasionally found, and other ornaments of gold\r\nand silver. It is said, however, that _donaria_ of precious metals\r\nwere after a time melted down and disposed of by the priests.\r\n\r\nGrateful patients or surgeons sometimes offered surgical instruments as\r\na thanksgiving for a successful surgical operation; thus it is stated\r\nErostratus offered to Apollo in the Temple of Delphus a forceps of\r\nlead, to show how little he approved of the fingers as a medium for\r\nextracting teeth. Drs. Sambon, Allaire, and others, who have discovered\r\na large number of _donaria_ of the Etruscan and Roman period, found\r\namong the pottery, invalid feeding-cups and feeding-bottles for\r\ninfants. Many of the latter were modelled in the form of the female\r\nbreast, and others in the shapes of animals. These articles were often\r\nplaced in the tombs of young children who had died in babyhood, instead\r\nof the dishes of various foods which were deposited in the tombs of\r\nadults.\r\n\r\nAmong other _donaria_ discovered, are models of the limbs and viscera\r\nof the human body in clay, showing upon them the marks of the various\r\ndiseases from which the votaries had suffered. Thus the ancient temples\r\nmust have presented a curious appearance, festooned on walls and\r\nceilings with these numerous models, all of which told a tale of human\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY AGE OF GREEK AND ROMAN PHARMACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRome at an early period gave birth to several philosophers and\r\npractitioners in the art of healing. Cornelius Celsus, who is thought\r\nto have been a Roman, was a much esteemed writer of the time, and his\r\nworks on medicine show the advanced state of surgery and medicine\r\nduring the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\nHis work on medicine gives a considerable insight into the pharmacy of\r\nthe Romans in his day. With reference to their weights, he says: “I\r\nwould have it understood that in an ounce is contained the weight of\r\nseven denarii; next, that I divide each denarius into six parts, that\r\nis, sextantes, so that I have the same quantity in the sextans of a\r\ndenarius that the Greeks have in their obolus”.\r\n\r\nOf the methods of administration employed in early Roman pharmacy,\r\nthe malagma was commonly used. It was a kind of soft mass composed of\r\nherbs and grass beaten up to the consistency of a thick paste, and\r\napplied to the skin. Numerous formulæ for malagmas are given, in which\r\npellitory, myrrh, resin, cardamoms, ammoniacum, galbanum, etc., are\r\nincluded. Their malagmas corresponded with our ointments. They also\r\nused plasters, of which the basilicon, of galbanum, pitch, resin, and\r\noil, in an improved form, has survived two thousand years. Troches, for\r\nhealing wounds, were composed of dry medicines held in suspension by\r\nsome liquid such as wine or oil. Pessaries (vaginal) were originated\r\nby the Greeks, who called them pessi. The ingredients were placed in\r\na piece of wool, and thus used. Powders and snuffs were also common\r\nmethods of administration.\r\n\r\nAntidotes for bruises, bites, and poisons were regarded as extremely\r\nimportant. One was called ambrosia, which Zopyrus is said to have\r\ncompounded for the King Ptolemy; another was the celebrated antidote of\r\nKing Mithridates.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks called their embrocations or ointments euchrista. The\r\ncatapotia was the method used for internal administration in liquid\r\nform, for which many recipes are given by Celsus. The following will\r\nserve as an example:—\r\n\r\n  _Athenio’s Catapotia for a Cough._\r\n\r\n  Myrrh, pepper, each         p. ♓ i.\r\n  Castor, poppy tears, each   p. ♓ i.\r\n\r\nwhich are bruised separately and afterwards mixed.\r\n\r\nFor venomous bites, the treatment of the ancients, if the wound was\r\nsevere, was first cupping, or, if slight, the plaster of Diogenes\r\nwas applied, or a salt fish bound over the wound. A curious remedy\r\npractised by the Greeks for hydrophobia was to throw the patient\r\nsuddenly into a pond, and “if he could not swim let him sink several\r\ntimes, and thus drink; if he can swim, keep him down at times until he\r\nmay be satiated with water, for thus at once,” writes Celsus, “is both\r\nthe thirst and the dread of water removed”.\r\n\r\nTheir antidote for nearly all poisons was warm oil, given in order to\r\ninduce vomiting.\r\n\r\nThe word collyrium, now applied to a lotion for the eyes, was also used\r\nby the ancients; but they gave it a greater latitude, and also employed\r\nit to describe a composition of powders wrought to a pasty consistence\r\nwith a liquid, and formed into something like a tent for insertion into\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nOf the chemical bodies and drugs known both to the Greeks and the\r\nRomans, the number is not a few.\r\n\r\nCinnabar, which seems to have been known from a very remote period, was\r\nthe name applied to the red sulphide of mercury, and also to dragon’s\r\nblood. It is doubtless of the latter Pliny says “he believed to be the\r\ngore of a dragon crushed by the weight of a dying elephant, with a\r\nmixture of the blood of these animals”. Copperas, lead, alum, copper,\r\nand iron were used as styptics.\r\n\r\nMyrrh, frankincense, cardamoms, linseed, isinglass, and cobwebs were\r\nused as astringents.\r\n\r\nGalbanum, storax, bitumen, are recommended for promoting suppuration,\r\nwhile pennyroyal, sulphur, pellitory, stavesacre, ox-gall, scammony,\r\nrue, and opium were all included in their medical recipes.\r\n\r\nDioscorides was the first to attempt to record in anything like a\r\nmethodical manner the many drugs and chemical substances used by the\r\nearly Greeks.\r\n\r\nPedacion Dioscorides, born in Anazaba in Cilicia, was a Greek\r\nphysician, who lived in or about the second century. He gathered a\r\ngreat portion of his information on _materia medica_ during his travels\r\nwith the Roman army, which he accompanied on several expeditions in the\r\ncapacity of physician. Afterwards he wrote his great work _Peri Hules\r\nIatrikes_ (about _materia medica_), which for fifteen centuries or\r\nmore remained one of the chief authorities on that science. It treats\r\nof all the medicines then in use, with their preparations and action\r\nas then known. The work of this early physician first appeared in a\r\nLatin translation in 1478; the first Greek edition being published in\r\n1499. The work was afterwards translated into Spanish, Italian, French,\r\nGerman, and Arabic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEDACION DIOSCORIDES.\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing, 1598.]\r\n\r\nIn describing the _Papaver sativum_ and its virtues in this work, he\r\nsays: “It is not improper to subjoin the method in which the opus or\r\njuice of it is collected. Some, then, cutting the poppy heads with the\r\nleaves, squeeze them through a press, and rubbing them in a mortar,\r\nform them into troches. This is called meconium, and is weaker than the\r\nopus. But whoever desires to gather the juice must proceed thus: After\r\nthe heads are moistened with dew, let him cut round the * (asterisk)\r\nwith a knife, but not penetrate through them, and from the sides cut\r\nstraight lines in the surface, and draw off the tear that flows with\r\nhis finger into a shell. And come again, not long after, for it will\r\nbe found standing upon it; and the day following it will be found in\r\nthe same manner.” Hence the old name poppy tears. Dioscorides was also\r\nlearned in the preparation of wool fat, which he calls œsypum, known\r\nto modern pharmacists as lanoline. He says: “Œsypum is the oily part\r\ncollected from sordid wool, thus: The wool was washed in warm water\r\nand all its sordes expressed; the fat floated with a froth, and upon\r\nthrowing in some sea-water it subsided; and when all the œsypum was\r\nobtained from it in this manner, it was purified by repeated affusions\r\nof water. When pure it had no sharp taste, and was in some degree\r\nastringent and appeared white, and was emollient and filled up ulcers.”\r\n\r\nRecent excavations made at Pompeii and Herculaneum have thrown some\r\nfurther light on various articles of _materia medica_ as it existed in\r\nthe days just preceding the destruction of those cities. Aloe seems to\r\nhave been held in high esteem by the practitioners of the time, and was\r\nemployed, we learn from the historian, in twenty-nine diseases. It was\r\nprescribed in doses from 1 to 111 drachmas (about 68 grains), and mixed\r\nwith wine was employed to stimulate the growth of the hair. Aconite, we\r\nfind, was used in four diseases; and was supposed to be an antidote to\r\nany poison which might exist in the system. Other remedies mentioned\r\ninclude gum acacia, colocynth, elaterium, gold, silver, copper, and\r\nelecampane. It is further recorded of the latter drug, that Julia\r\nAugusta, daughter of Augustus Cæsar, used to eat the root daily.\r\n\r\nOf the vegetable remedies about 150 are enumerated, and of these the\r\ncabbage seems to have held a prominent place. Other favourite medicines\r\nwere rye, garlic, anise, mallow, rose, and lily.\r\n\r\nIn the animal kingdom, the remedies contributed were numerous, being\r\nmainly the various parts of man and beast. Among some of the least\r\ndisgusting, hair, blood, and saliva may be mentioned.\r\n\r\nScrapings from the bodies of athletes, mixed with the oil with which\r\nthey anointed themselves, were used as a tonic. The hair of a man\r\ntorn from the cross was used as a remedy for quartan fever. The hyæna\r\nwas employed as a medicinal agent in seventy-nine diseases; and the\r\ncrocodile, chameleon, lion, elephant, camel, and the hippopotamus all\r\ncontributed certain curative agents. Wool fat was held in great esteem.\r\n\r\nOf minerals, iron, lead, nitrum, salt, gold, tin, silver, realgar,\r\ncopper, and misy (a combination of the sulphates of copper and iron)\r\nare enumerated. Most of these articles are mentioned by the second\r\nPliny, who was killed during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius which\r\nburied Pompeii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nALCHEMY—THE ALCHEMISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word chemistry was used for the first time by Suidas, a\r\nlexicographer of the tenth century, and at that time meant an alloy\r\nof gold and silver. It is alluded to in connection with the Emperor\r\nDiocletian, of whom it is said, that irritated by a revolt of the\r\nEgyptians against the laws of the empire, he had all their books of\r\nchemistry committed to the flames, so as to punish them for their\r\nrebellion by preventing them from carrying on the lucrative business\r\narising out of the melting and working of precious metals. There is\r\nlittle doubt the Egyptians and Greeks were acquainted with certain\r\nchemical operations, or what was termed the hermetic science, which was\r\nafterwards called alchemy in the first century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe first two great lights that appeared were Al-Chindus, and Geber\r\nwho discovered the red oxide and bichloride of mercury, nitric acid,\r\nhydrochloric acid, and nitrate of silver. Geber’s _Summa Perfectionis_\r\nand _Liber Philisophorum_ embody his researches on the purification\r\nand malleability of metals. In the ninth century, the Arab alchemist\r\nRhazes flourished. In his great work entitled _El Hharvi_, he\r\nalludes to realgar, orpiment, borax, mixtures of sulphur and iron\r\nwith copper, and of mercury with acids, and arsenic. He further\r\nrecommends physicians to use alcoholic preparations and animal oils,\r\netc. He states: “The secret art of chemistry is nearer possible than\r\nimpossible; the mysteries do not reveal themselves except by force of\r\nlabour and perseverance. But what a triumph it is when man can raise\r\na corner of the veil which conceals the works of God!” The knowledge\r\ndisplayed of chemistry and its application to the arts at that early\r\nperiod is wonderful, but books were few. The chief evidence of this\r\nknowledge is exhibited in the many specimens and art monuments in the\r\nmuseums of Spain, showing the skill of the Saracens and of the Moors.\r\n\r\nA little later Mesué states, “certain principles had been recognised as\r\nto the analytical classification of the bodies which compose organic\r\nmatter”.\r\n\r\nOf the ancient necromancers who have figured in history and romance,\r\nMerlin was perhaps the most extraordinary. The earliest mention of\r\nhis name is in records of the eleventh century, although he appears to\r\nhave flourished about the time of the Saxon invasion of Britain, in the\r\nlatter part of the fifth century.\r\n\r\nHe is first mentioned in connection with the fortune of Vortigern,\r\nwho is represented by Geoffrey of Monmouth, as at that time King of\r\nEngland. Vortigern having lost all his strongholds in his struggle\r\nwith the Saxons, at length consulted his magicians as to how he was\r\nto defend himself from his troublesome foe. They advised him to build\r\nan impregnable tower, and chose a suitable site for its erection. The\r\nbuilders set to work with might and main, but were astonished to find,\r\nthat as fast as they built in one day, the next morning the earth had\r\nswallowed it up, and not a vestige remained. So the king called the\r\nwise men together again, when they arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nonly way to remedy the matter was to cement the walls of the tower with\r\nthe blood of a human being who was born of no human father.\r\n\r\nVortigern at once sent forth emissaries to scour the country in search\r\nof this _rara avis_, and at length by good fortune they came across\r\nMerlin, near the town of Caermarthen in Wales, who claimed that his\r\nmother was the daughter of a king but his father was an angelic being.\r\nThe king’s emissaries evidently took his word for it, as they speedily\r\ncarried him before Vortigern. A great meeting of the magicians was\r\ncalled, at which the king presided, and Merlin, instead of being\r\ncondemned as the victim, confounded the wise men, and told the king\r\nthe ground they had chosen for his tower had a lake beneath it, at\r\nthe bottom of which, on being drained, they would find two dragons of\r\ninextinguishable hostility. Under the form of dragons he appears to\r\nhave figured the Britons and Saxons in his speech, “all of which,” the\r\nhistorian tells us, “proved to be true”.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest exploit with which Merlin is credited, according to\r\ntradition, is the erection of Stonehenge as a lasting monument to the\r\n300 British nobles massacred by the Saxons. It is supposed that these\r\nmighty stones had been originally set up in Africa, and from thence\r\nwere transported to Ireland. Merlin commanded that they should be\r\ncarried over the sea, and erected on Salisbury Plain; but no workman\r\ncould be found to move them. He therefore brought his magical power to\r\nbear on the huge stones, and by this means they were caused to take the\r\nform in which they now stand.\r\n\r\nOf the other wonderful stories which romance has woven round the career\r\nof this strange individual, we can only say they are interesting, if\r\nnot exactly true. As 600 years elapsed between the time of Merlin and\r\nthe earliest known records of his achievements, it is impossible to\r\npronounce on their veracity.\r\n\r\nAmong the more famous of the early alchemists was St. Dunstan, who\r\nflourished in the tenth century; but, if tradition speaks truly, he\r\nwas anything but a saint in character. He is said to have been a man\r\nof distinguished birth, who in his young days lived a life of great\r\nself-indulgence, even for that period of peculiar morality. At length,\r\nhe was seized with a dangerous illness which threatened to terminate\r\nhis career; but at the last extremity an angel appeared, bringing\r\na medicine which speedily restored him to health. Hastening to the\r\nnearest church to return thanks, he was stopped by the devil with a\r\npack of black dogs, whom however he speedily put to flight. In order to\r\nexpiate his former irregularities, he now secluded himself in the abbey\r\nof Glastonbury, where he occupied a cell in which he could neither\r\nstand upright nor stretch his limbs in repose, and mortified his flesh\r\nexceedingly. Here he studied alchemy and magic, in which arts he soon\r\nbecame well versed. While in this cell, he is said to have had the most\r\nextraordinary visitations, and among others the devil was constantly\r\nthrusting his head in at the window and taunting the saint, while\r\nimmersed in his studies. At length, one day, wearied out, Dunstan lost\r\nall patience, and seizing his red-hot tongs from the little furnace in\r\nwhich he conducted his chemical operations, caught the devil by the\r\nnose, and held him firmly, “while the bellowings of Satan,” says the\r\nhistorian, “filled the whole neighbourhood for many miles round”. This\r\nincident is frequently represented in ancient carvings.\r\n\r\nDunstan was a Benedictine monk, and next came forth and took a\r\nprominent part in political and religious matters. He seems to have\r\nbeen the king-maker of his time, and took a prominent part in the\r\nruling of the kingdom during the reigns of Edwy and Edgar.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration the alchemist, with uplifted torch, is\r\nrepeating the specified incantation over the still, under which he has\r\njust kindled a fire, having commenced the preparation of the “Elixir of\r\nLife”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALCHEMIST.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving dated 1576.]\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 1260, Albertus Magnus, formerly a Dominican monk, was\r\nmade master of the sacred palace at the court of Rome, and afterwards\r\nBishop of Ratisbon. This great philosophical student was learned in\r\nall the then known arts of chemistry, and his manuscripts and works\r\nwere copied by the thousand. All kinds of extraordinary powers were\r\nattributed to him, and it was commonly stated that he could make gold,\r\nand that he was a magician. Accused of “having dealings” with the evil\r\none, he resigned his high position and returned to his cloistered cell\r\nto carry on his favourite researches and end his days. Next we come to\r\nVincent de Beauvais, often called the Pliny of the middle ages. He,\r\ntoo, was accused of sorcery, and it is said that “at midnight people\r\nwould creep along the quays of the Seine towards his laboratory in St.\r\nChapelle yard, to see if they could get a glimpse reflected in the\r\nriver of the magic furnaces in which De Beauvais was supposed to evoke\r\nhis familiar spirit”.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Raymond Lulli became known to fame. He also\r\nwas a monk, and born in the island of Majorca, but having a roving\r\ndisposition he wandered over Europe. He wrote several works on alchemy,\r\namong others _Libilli Aliquot Chemici_, etc. Fabulous stories are\r\nrelated of his adventures; and he was cruelly stoned to death by\r\nthe populace in Tunis, in 1315. He left behind him a following of\r\nbelievers, who called themselves Lullists and spread all over Europe.\r\nThe genius of the West at this time was Arnauld de Villeneuve, who\r\nmade several important discoveries in chemistry. His researches were\r\nparticularly directed to the relation of chemistry to medicine. He is\r\ncredited with having discovered sulphuric and other acids, and is said\r\nto have been the first to distil alcohol or spirit of wine.\r\n\r\nContemporary with these men of learning was our own Roger Bacon, whose\r\nlove for his art nearly cost him his life, besides many years in\r\nprison. The discoverer of gunpowder and the telescope spent most of his\r\nlife in experimental researches, with the result that he revolutionised\r\nthe art of war, and gave to astronomers the power of exploring the\r\nheavens. He was a man of great ability, never justly appreciated by his\r\ncontemporaries, and has been rightly named the father of experimental\r\nphysics. He described most of the laws which regulate matter, and the\r\nregular motion of the planets. Although a man of undoubted knowledge\r\nand great power of conception, he was bitten with the mania of\r\nendeavouring to discover the philosopher’s stone, his views respecting\r\nwhich he set forth in his work entitled _Radix Mundi_. Following Bacon\r\ncame Antonio Quainer, of Pavia, who was the first to manufacture\r\nartificial mineral waters.\r\n\r\nIt has been said by some that the discoveries made by the alchemists\r\nwere mainly the result of chance, and they were mostly ignorant\r\ncharlatans; but although they had little method in their research,\r\nand a great deal of their knowledge was wrapped up in absurd and\r\nsuperstitious theories, when we look at the result of their discoveries\r\nup to the fifteenth century, the most prejudiced must admit that\r\ntheir labours were not spent entirely in vain. They demonstrated the\r\nexistence of bismuth, liver of sulphur, and regulus of antimony, the\r\ndistillation of alcohol, volatilisation of mercury, and preparation of\r\naqua regia, sulphuric and other mineral acids, and the purification\r\nof alkalies. They had the scarlet dye for cloth, the secret of which\r\nhas now been lost and cannot be equalled, and their processes of\r\nglass-staining cannot be approached by those employed at the present\r\nday. It is said that Eck, a German alchemist of Sultzbach, ascertained\r\nthe existence of oxygen 300 years before it was demonstrated by\r\nPriestly. For these and other discoveries we have to thank the early\r\nalchemists.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries alchemy began to shake\r\nitself free from the wild theories and absurd practices which had\r\nimpeded its progress. Henry VII. issued a severe edict against\r\nalchemical practices, which put a stop to the impositions of a number\r\nof charlatans. About this period John Baptist Porta discovered the\r\nmeans of reducing the metallic oxides and of colouring silver, and\r\nIsaac and Jean Hollandus made great improvements in enamelling, and\r\ndemonstrated the manufacture of artificial gems.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Paracelsus and the introduction of printing, the\r\nscience received a fresh impetus, and a new order of chemists came into\r\nbeing, whose conflict with the old order for many years is a matter of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe old theories of the alchemists were gradually exploded and\r\nsuperseded, and many were driven to the most flagrant quackery to earn\r\na living.\r\n\r\nCornelius Agrippa, who was one of the leaders of the new order, says:\r\n“It would take too much time to recount all the follies, the idle\r\nsecrets, and the enigmas of this trade, of the green lion, the fugitive\r\nstag, the flying eagle, the inflated toad, the crow’s head of the black\r\nblacker than the black, of the seal of Mercury, of the mud of wisdom,\r\nand other countless absurdities of the time. Many of them travelled\r\nfrom fair to fair in order to make a little money by the sale of white\r\nlead, vermilion, antimony, and other drugs used by women for painting\r\nthe face, and drugs which the Scripture calls ointments of lust.”\r\nMeanwhile the efforts of the practical workers were encouraged by\r\nadministrators and princes, with the result that the application of\r\nchemistry and the technical arts became predominant, and metallurgy the\r\nleading spirit of the science.\r\n\r\nA notable character in the time of Queen Elizabeth was Dr. Dee,\r\nalchemist and astrologer. The career of this man, who was more a\r\ncharlatan than aught else, was one of extraordinary vicissitude. A\r\nWelshman by birth, he was educated at Oxford, and then travelled\r\nthroughout Europe, claiming that he had discovered the elixir of life\r\nand the philosopher’s stone. He was a man of overweening ambition,\r\nand delighted to hear himself called “Most Excellent”. In company\r\nwith a man named Kelly, it is said he discovered a quantity of the\r\nelixir in the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey; this they at once annexed\r\nand carried off to Poland, accompanied by a nobleman of that country.\r\nAfter travelling from one Court to another, where he is said to have\r\nperformed wonderful feats with his elixir, he returned to England and\r\nsettled at Mortlake, where Elizabeth often visited him to consult him\r\non astrology, and he even ventured to predict her death.[3] He was a\r\ngreat favourite at Court in 1595, and the Queen made him Chancellor of\r\nPaul’s and Warden of Manchester, but he died in great poverty.\r\n\r\n        [3] Lilly’s _Autobiography_, 1774.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ALCHEMIST.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving dated 1576.]\r\n\r\nThe illustration represents an alchemist of the sixteenth century in\r\nan ante-room of his laboratory, engaged in fixing a portion of his\r\napparatus. On the table is his luting box and knife. Through one window\r\na view of the laboratory with stills of varied size is obtained, while\r\nthrough the other the sun looks with becoming gravity on the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SYMBOLS OF THE ALCHEMISTS.\r\n\r\nAs in modern science chemists write their formulæ and work out their\r\nprocesses by means of symbols, so the alchemists used signs and\r\nhieroglyphics to represent the then known elements, metals, and other\r\narticles in common use. The so-called elements—fire, air, water,\r\nearth—were represented by special symbols, here represented. The\r\nmetals were supposed to be influenced by the planets to a certain\r\ndegree, and were represented by their corresponding signs. Various\r\nother articles also had their symbols, which served as a means of\r\nshorthand at a period when caligraphy was little known or employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Symbols for: Fire. Air.

In the same spirit the modern worker in science gropes\r\nonward, and dreams of discovering some contribution towards solving\r\nthe elixir of life, in the form, it may be, of conquering at least one\r\nfell disease. The ancient workers in alchemy confined their researches\r\nalmost exclusively to metals; they believed that all natural things\r\nwere composed of four elements, which they termed Fire, Air, Earth, and\r\nWater. “When these four elements are conjoined,” says Roger Bacon, in\r\nhis _Radix Mundi_, “they become another thing, whereas it is evident\r\nthat all things in Nature are composed of the said elements being\r\naltered and changed.”\r\n\r\nBut the patient researches of the alchemists were not so much due to a\r\nlove for scientific investigation as to the overwhelming desire to gain\r\nwealth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STILL FOR DYSTILLING THE WATER OF LYFE.\r\n\r\n1576.]\r\n\r\nThe majority had two fixed objects in view as the goals of their\r\nambition, one being the discovery of some body that would be capable of\r\ntransmuting the baser metals into gold and silver; and the other, the\r\ndiscovery of an elixir which would prolong the span of human life to\r\nan indefinite period. Both these objects seem to have been sought for\r\nby man from prehistoric times, and their origin is lost in antiquity.\r\nBerthelot remarks that the term “Philosopher’s Stone” does not occur in\r\nwritings earlier than the seventh century, although the central idea is\r\nmuch more ancient.\r\n\r\nThe philosopher’s stone was sought for by the Chinese philosophers at a\r\nvery remote period, afterwards by the Greeks, Arabs, and others down to\r\nthe seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nMen of undoubted ability and genius wasted both their lives and\r\ntheir fortunes over the search for this illusive chimera, and others\r\ncondescended to fraud and trickery of the meanest description in\r\nits pursuit. Apparently no alchemist of any repute thought it right\r\nto die until he had at least claimed to have solved one of these\r\ngreat problems. Thus claimants to the discovery were numerous. The\r\ndescriptions given of the various processes in ancient manuscripts\r\nand works for producing the philosopher’s stone are usually of a very\r\nelaborate description, and couched in the most fantastic language.\r\n\r\nFailure to produce the desired result was invariably accounted for by\r\nthe omission to carry out some minute detail. Some who professed to\r\nhave discovered the secret demanded large sums of money to reveal it,\r\nand several visited the various courts of Europe to demonstrate it by\r\nmeans of trickery and conjuring.\r\n\r\nThe notorious Dr. Dee, who flourished in the time of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nwas one of the last claimants to the discovery, and is said to have\r\nreceived immense sums of money from dupes for imparting the coveted\r\nsecret, which he demonstrated by means of an ingenious trick.\r\n\r\nRealgar, mercury, sulphur, and many other substances were credited with\r\nthe magical property of transmutation.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration (p. 65), which is taken from an authentic\r\nengraving of the sixteenth century, we have a figure of the apparatus\r\nused for distilling the “Water of Life,” the process for which is\r\ndescribed by Gesnerus in the _Newe Jewell of Health_, printed in 1576.\r\nThe alchemist, arrayed in his imposing robes, is depicted giving\r\ninstructions to his assistant as to certain precautions to be taken in\r\nconducting the process.\r\n\r\nBacon states that sulphur and mercury are the mineral roots and natural\r\nprinciples upon which Nature herself acts and works in the mines and\r\ncaverns of the earth; the latter metal he believed to be the true\r\nelixir of the philosopher’s stone; others, including Rhazes and Merlin,\r\nbelieved it to be an amalgam of gold and mercury, fantastically called\r\nthe Red man and his White wife.\r\n\r\nConcerning the vessels for producing this “Citrine body,” as Bacon\r\ncalls it, the most exact precautions were taken. Special apparatus was\r\nused, and a special heat, which was not to exceed the heat of the body.\r\nFor this purpose horse-dung was employed. Senier, the philosopher,\r\nsays: “Dig a sepulchre and bury the woman (mercury) with her man (gold)\r\nin horse-dung, the fire of the philosopher, until such time as they be\r\nconjoined”.\r\n\r\nBacon’s definition of alchemy was: “Alchymie is the art or science\r\nteaching how to make or generate a certain kind of medicine which is\r\ncalled the elixir. It teaches how to transmute all kinds of metals, one\r\nwith another; and this by a proper medicine.” George Ripley, a monk,\r\nin 1476, thought that he had discovered the much-coveted stone in pure\r\nsulphur. He says: “Let the two sulphurs, _viz._, the white and the red,\r\nbe mingled with the oil of the white elixir that they may work the more\r\nstrongly, and you shall have the highest medicine in the world to heal\r\nand cure human bodies, and to transmute the bodies of metals into the\r\nmost pure fine gold and silver”. Berthelot, who has made an exhaustive\r\nstudy of the subject, comes to the conclusion that the doctrines of\r\nalchemy concerning the transmutation of metals, did not originate in\r\nthe philosophical views of the constitution of matter as generally\r\nsupposed, but in the practical experiments of goldsmiths occupied in\r\nmaking fraudulent substitutes for the precious metals. One cannot but\r\nthink with pity of the immense labour expended and lost in the attempt\r\nmade by many of these pioneers of science in their pursuit after this\r\nchemical chimera.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, as well as his predecessors, laboured studiously to\r\ndiscover some method for prolonging life. Like Bacon and Verulam, he\r\nmaintained that the human body could be rejuvenated to a certain extent\r\nby a fresh supply of vitality, and it was his aim to find means by\r\nwhich such a supply could be obtained. In one of his works he gives the\r\nfollowing reasons for this belief: “Metals may be preserved from rust\r\nand wood may be protected against rot. Blood may be preserved a long\r\ntime if the air is excluded. Egyptian mummies have kept their form for\r\ncenturies without undergoing putrefaction. Animals awaken from their\r\nwinter sleep, and flies having become torpid from cold become nimble\r\nagain when they are warmed. Therefore, if inanimate objects can be kept\r\nfrom destruction, why should there be no possibility to preserve the\r\nlife-essence of animate forms?” For this purpose he prepared a remedy\r\nhe called _Primum Ens Melissæ_, which was made by dissolving pure\r\ncarbonate of potass, and macerating in the liquid the fresh leaves of\r\nthe _melissa_ plant. On this absolute alcohol was poured several times\r\nin successive portions to absorb the colouring matter, after which it\r\nwas collected, distilled, and evaporated to the thickness of a syrup.\r\nThe second great secret elixir of Paracelsus was his _Primum Ens\r\nSanguinis_. This was prepared by mixing blood from the medium vein of a\r\nhealthy young person, and digesting it in a warm place with twice its\r\nquantity of _alcahest_, after which the red fluid was to be separated\r\nfrom the sediment, filtered, and preserved.\r\n\r\nThe alcahest was his celebrated universal medicine, and was considered\r\nthe greatest mystery of all. It was made with freshly prepared caustic\r\nlime and absolute alcohol. These were distilled together ten times. The\r\nresidue left in the retort was mixed with pure carbonate of potass and\r\ndried. This was again distilled with alcohol. It was then placed in a\r\ndish and set on fire, and the residue that remained was the alcahest.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were found inscribed on the fly-leaf of an old work\r\non alchemy, printed in 1550, and signed “PHILO VERITAS”:—\r\n\r\n\r\nELIXIR VITÆ.\r\n\r\n    When fire and water, earth and air\r\n    In love’s true bond united are,\r\n    For all diseases then be sure\r\n    You have a safe and certain cure.\r\n    I will affirm it’s here alone\r\n    Exists the Philosophic Stone.\r\n    This is fair nature’s virgin root,\r\n    Thrice blest are they who reap the fruit:\r\n    But oh! where one true adept’s found,\r\n    Ten thousand thousand cheats abound.\r\n\r\nIn an ancient work in the library of York Minster, the writer came\r\nacross the following in manuscript, signed “RAYMUND LULLI”:—\r\n\r\n    Remember man that is the most noble creature in composition that\r\n        ever God wrought;\r\n    In whom be four elements proportioned by nature,\r\n    A neutral mercuriallyte which costeth right naught,\r\n    Out of his monie by manie it is bought;\r\n    And our monie be not all but our oxtalle towe,\r\n    Of the sun and the moon; which Raymund Said So.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK ART AND OCCULT SCIENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a thorough analysis of this interesting subject, and trace\r\nthe origin of magic, would take much more space than we have at our\r\ncommand; and we can only mention a few of the many forms which may be\r\ngrouped under the head of the occult sciences, and those especially\r\nwhich had any connection with the alchemists. There is little doubt\r\nthat most of the alchemists were students, if not practitioners, of\r\nmagic or some of its branches.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of magic is very great; and we have record of magicians\r\nand wise men in early Jewish times, as well as the magic formulæ of the\r\nVedas in India, as handed down to us in the religion of the Hindoos.\r\nMoreover, magic was practised by the Chaldeans, of whom a certain tribe\r\ndevoted their energies to studying the occult sciences. Pliny tells us\r\nof the dealings in the supernatural in the time of Homer, and other\r\nwriters record that magic was also known to the Etruscans and Assyrians\r\nat a very early period. As time rolled on, the different forms of\r\nmagic practised became specialised, according to their several natures.\r\nFor instance, there were Astrology and Oneiromancy, which comprised the\r\nvarious forms of divination; Theurgy and Goetry, the art of evoking\r\ngood or evil spirits; Necromancy, by means of which communication was\r\nheld with the dead; and Sorcery, which exercised its power by the\r\ninfluence of dreams.\r\n\r\nThe longings after the supernatural and unknown felt by the great\r\nignorant masses brought forth individuals in plenty to take advantage\r\nof their credulity. During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the\r\noccult sciences were openly taught in the universities and schools,\r\nand 200 years later reached the zenith of their influence; and\r\npractitioners of astrology and the black arts abounded and flourished\r\nthroughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe professors of Oneiromancy were those who divined or interpreted\r\ndreams, and founded their traditions in the art from its being in\r\naccordance with the Scriptures. The explanation of dreams also did\r\nnot go counter to the doctrines of the Church, and so the cult found\r\nmany believers among all classes of society. It was denounced by Pope\r\nGregory II. as a detestable practice; but this did not prevent it being\r\nlargely employed in forecasting the future.\r\n\r\nArnauld de Villeneuve, who wrote a work on the subject in the\r\nthirteenth century, gives a certain code by which those who practised\r\nit worked.\r\n\r\nWhoever dreamt that his hair was thick and carefully curled would\r\nsoon become wealthy. If anything was wrong with the hair, evil was\r\nbetokened. It also foreshadowed harm if a wreath was worn composed of\r\nflowers that were not in season. Other codes signified that to dream\r\nof the eyes, related to children; the head, to a father; the arms, to\r\nbrothers; the feet, to servants; the right hand, to the mother, to\r\nsons, and to friends; and the left hand, to the wife and daughter.\r\nAnother method was founded on the theory that whatever was dreamt of,\r\nthe antithesis or opposite would follow in life. From this we have\r\nprobably the saying common to-day, “dream of a wedding and it is a sign\r\nof a funeral”. According to many old writers there was scarcely any\r\nimportant event in the middle ages which was not announced by a dream.\r\n\r\nThe day before Henry II. was struck by the blow of a lance during a\r\ntournament, Catherine de Medicis, his wife, dreamt that she saw him\r\nlose one of his eyes. Three days before he fell by the knife of Jacques\r\nClément, Henry III. dreamt he saw the royal insignia stained with\r\nblood and trodden under foot by monks and people of the lower orders.\r\n\r\nHenry IV. also, before he was murdered by Raveillac, it is said, heard\r\nduring the night his wife Marie de Medicis say to herself as she woke,\r\n“Dreams are but falsehoods!” and when he asked her what she had dreamt,\r\nshe replied, “That you were stabbed upon the steps of the little\r\nLouvre!” “Thank God it is but a dream,” rejoined the king.\r\n\r\nThe necromancers, who were supposed to be able to conjure up spirits\r\nand raise the dead, were accounted on a somewhat higher plane than the\r\ninterpreters of dreams. They also based their authority on the Old\r\nTestament. The nature of the art was gruesome and awe-inspiring, and\r\nthere is little doubt many dark deeds were perpetrated by those who\r\npractised it. One method of evocation was to kill a child and place\r\nits head upon a dish surrounded by lighted candles; the desired spirit\r\nwas supposed to enter this ghastly object and speak through its mouth.\r\nSometimes the spirit simply consisted of some muttered words from\r\nbehind a curtain in a dark cellar; another method was to cause the\r\nappearance of a sepulchral figure out of smoke or vapour, which would\r\nindicate by gesture and reply to questions asked. To evoke a dead\r\nman’s spirit, it was necessary to go to the grave at midnight with a\r\ncompanion who bore a candle in the left hand and a crystal stone in the\r\nright, the conjurer holding a hazel wand with the name of God written\r\non it, and repeating the words:—\r\n\r\n“Tetragrammaton + Adonai + Agla + Craton +”\r\n\r\nThen striking three times on the ground, with a prayer he commanded the\r\nspirit into the stone, when it appeared in the shape of a child.\r\n\r\nThe conjurer often wore a girdle of lion’s skin with the name of God\r\nwritten on it, and the Solomon’s circle he described with a bright\r\nknife, on the blade of which were written certain mystic words.\r\nNecromancy gradually merged into sorcery, which has occasionally come\r\nto the surface in comparatively recent years.\r\n\r\nChiromancy, the art of divining or foretelling future events from\r\nmarks on the palm of the hand, was also practised in antiquity,\r\nbut in mediæval times it was strongly opposed by the Church. The\r\npractice is supposed to have been brought into Europe from the East\r\nby the Bohemians in the early part of the fifteenth century. This art\r\neventually merged into astrology, which exerted the greatest influence\r\nof all the occult sciences.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of astrology is very great, it having been originated\r\nby the Chaldeans, and was thought by some of the Jews to have been a\r\nmethod by which the Creator could communicate with His people. The art\r\nitself was based on astronomy, and, like alchemy, was the beginning of\r\nthe study of real natural science. The teller of the stars was not only\r\nsupposed to foretell forthcoming misfortunes to individuals, but also\r\nto forecast the destinies of kings and empires.\r\n\r\nThe belief in its power was so great that it became the fashion among\r\nroyal personages of the sixteenth century to keep their own special\r\nastrologers, who were lodged easy of access and loaded with honours and\r\nwealth. These men were mostly astute Jews well versed in the science\r\nof their time, and by means of their supposed powers they often played\r\na very important part in the political affairs of the nation. Thus in\r\nthe fifteenth century Rovigo, an astrologer of eminence, who is said\r\nto have perfected the astrolabe, was attached to the Court of King\r\nJohn II. of Portugal; and Simon Pharès figured at the Court of France\r\nin the time of Charles VIII. We must not forget to mention Cosmo\r\nRuggieri, the Florentine astrologer and the confidant of Catherine\r\nde Medicis; also the celebrated Nostradamus, astrologer and trusted\r\nadviser of Charles IX. This extraordinary man played a prominent part\r\nin the history of his time, and was supposed to practise magic and\r\nalchemy as well as the healing art. He was consulted by the king in all\r\npositions of difficulty, and it is said became immensely wealthy. He\r\ndied in 1566 at Salon, after having written several notable works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF FORETELLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early theory of the art of foretelling by means of the stars, and\r\ncasting horoscopes, was as follows: The seven planets then known,\r\nincluding the Sun, with the twelve figures of the Zodiac, comprised\r\nthe astrological system. Each unit or body or nation was supposed to\r\nbe governed or influenced by a certain star or constellation, and this\r\npower extended to all things connected with the person or nation.\r\nThus, Saturn was supposed to influence life, sciences, and buildings;\r\nJupiter—honour, wishes, and wealth; Mars—wars, persons, marriages,\r\nand quarrels; the Sun—hope, gain, and happiness; Venus—love\r\nand friendship; Mercury—fear, disease, debts, and commerce; the\r\nMoon—robberies, wounds, and dreams. The intrinsic quality was denoted\r\nby the planet. The Sun was regarded as favourable; Saturn, cold;\r\nJupiter, temperate; Mars, ardent; Venus, fruitful; Mercury, inconstant;\r\nthe Moon, melancholy. The days, colours, and metals also came under\r\nthe same influences.\r\n\r\nIn casting a horoscope, the astronomer had first to observe if the time\r\nwas propitious, and what planet was dominant in the heavens. Then, by\r\nmeans of calculations and diagrams, he would deduce the consequences\r\nfrom the position and bearing of the stars. The day was divided into\r\nfour equal parts—the ascendant of the sun, the middle of the sky,\r\nthe descending of the sun, and the lower part of the sky. These four\r\nparts of the day were subdivided into twelve distinct parts, which\r\nwere called the twelve houses of the sun. It was of the greatest\r\nimportance in drawing a horoscope to tell exactly in which “house” the\r\nstar appeared. One can easily trace the connection of the influence\r\nattributed to the planets with the old Egyptian and Greek mythologies,\r\nand it can hardly be wondered at that the same system should have been\r\nbrought to bear on medicine.\r\n\r\nA favourite method of divination, especially with the sorcerers, was\r\nthat of gazing into a beryl or crystal. For the proper performance of\r\nthis ceremony a pure virgin or equally pure youth should be the gazer.\r\nThe sorcerer, having repeated the necessary charms and adjurations,\r\nwith the invocation suitable to the spirits he wished to consult,\r\nlooked into a large beryl or crystal, wherein he saw the answer\r\nrepresented either by types or by figures, and sometimes it is said he\r\nmight hear the spirit speak to him.\r\n\r\nVallancey states that in the Highlands of Scotland large crystals of\r\nsomewhat oval shape were kept by the priests to work charms with,\r\nand that water poured on them was given to cattle as a preventive of\r\ndisease. Dr. Dee was a famous conjurer with the crystal in the time of\r\nQueen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nLilly describes these crystals as being the size of an orange, set in\r\nsilver, surmounted with a cross, and engraved all round with the names\r\nof the angels—Raphael, Gabriel, and Uriel.\r\n\r\nAmong other charms practised was Dactylomancy, which was performed by\r\nmeans of a ring suspended by a thread in the centre of an earthenware\r\nor metal pitcher. The ring, which was supposed to have been made under\r\nthe influence of a certain constellation, was swung from side to\r\nside of the vessel, and the sounds it made on touching were taken as\r\npredictions and oracles.\r\n\r\nThe art of divination by fire was called Pyromancy, and was performed\r\nby allowing a certain body to burn, the smoke from which, by its\r\ndensity and colour, forecast the future. A favourite medium for\r\nconsulting this oracle was a donkey’s head roasted on hot coals.\r\n\r\nPopular belief in mediæval times attributed anything unusual or\r\nbeyond its understanding, to magic; so most of the early alchemists\r\nwere believed to be magicians. Both Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon\r\nwere accused of dealing in the black arts, one having to resign his\r\nbishopric of Cologne and retire to a monastery, and the other to the\r\nFranciscan cells in Paris, to free themselves from the charges of their\r\naccusers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nBLACK MAGIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeber, an alchemist of great repute in Arabia, was believed to possess\r\nthe power of creating gold by magic. He was a man of undoubted learning\r\nand a skilful practitioner of his time, yet he was dubbed a sorcerer.\r\nHe was said to possess all kinds of extraordinary implements; among\r\nothers, a book of black magic which gave him full power over demons,\r\nand a brass idol which spoke oracles. On the day of his death, in\r\n1003, the Evil One is supposed to have carried him off. James Iodoc,\r\nan Englishman, achieved considerable notoriety by claiming that he had\r\nsucceeded in setting the demon in a magic ring. These men should not be\r\nconfounded with the host of impostors and charlatans who simply preyed\r\non the credulity of the people, but in those days all were judged\r\nalike. Most of the great mediæval alchemists dabbled in magic, and all\r\nagreed that to obtain the intervention of Satan in human affairs it was\r\nnecessary to enter into a pact with him. Those who went to this length\r\nand became exponents of demonology, or the black art, were initiated\r\nwith much solemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAKING THE OATH.\r\n\r\nThe oath to the demon had to be pronounced in the centre of a circle\r\ntraced upon the ground, accompanied by the offer of some pledge, such\r\nas a garment of the noviciate. The edge of the circle was supposed to\r\nestablish a mark which the demon could not cross. Heavy perfumes such\r\nas vervain, with burning incense and lighted tapers, always formed part\r\nof the ceremonial. The smoking brazier, which entered largely into\r\nthe ritual, was believed to act upon the demons, and was constantly\r\nfed with all kinds of mysterious vegetable and animal substances,\r\nthose that would produce most smoke being preferred. It is said that\r\nbelladonna and opium were always used as ingredients in the incense, in\r\norder to produce a state of semi-stupor and influence the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe perfumes employed by the professors of the art had each a special\r\nsignificance, and were offered to some planet to form a link with the\r\nearth. A mixture of saffron, amber, musk, cloves and incense, together\r\nwith the brain of an eagle and the blood of a cock, was offered to the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nThe white poppy and camphor burnt in the head of a frog, with the eyes\r\nof a bull and the blood of a goose, were dedicated to the Moon; while\r\nto Mars, sulphur was mixed with hellebore and euphorbium, together with\r\nthe blood of a black cat and the brain of a crow, and then burnt.\r\n\r\nOne can imagine the horrible odour that would be caused by burning\r\nsuch articles as these; and, as the columns of smoke ascended, the\r\nhalf-stupefied and scared spectator fancied he saw the forms of\r\nwrithing demons in the air.\r\n\r\nVery curious properties were attributed to certain articles when thrown\r\non live coals. Thus, if thunder and rain were required, the liver of\r\na chameleon was said to produce it; while the gall of a cuttle-fish\r\nburnt with roses and aloes-wood was all that was necessary to induce an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nBy burning coriander, parsley, hemlock, liquor of black poppy, giant\r\nfennel, red sandal-wood and henbane, almost any number of demons could\r\nbe raised. Sorcerers of this class were called tempest-raisers.\r\n\r\nWith the witchcraft practised largely by women in mediæval times, we\r\nhave not much to do; although belief in its influence was widespread\r\nduring the middle ages. To bewitch an individual was to cause him\r\ngradually to die a mysterious death.\r\n\r\nThe process commenced at first with great secrecy, by modelling a\r\nfigure of the intended victim in wax or clay. This having been done,\r\na swallow was killed, and the heart placed under the right arm of\r\nthe figure and the liver under the left. The effigy was next pricked\r\nall over with new needles, each prick being accompanied by the most\r\nterrible imprecations against the victim.\r\n\r\nAnother method was to make the figure of earth taken from a graveyard\r\nand mixed with dead bones. Certain mystic signs were then inscribed on\r\nit, which were said eventually to cause the death of the victim. So\r\ngeneral did the practice of witchcraft become that no class of society\r\nwas safe from accusation and suspicion, thousands perishing by the\r\nfaggot and torture.\r\n\r\nFrom the fourteenth to the sixteenth century, supernatural beliefs\r\nexerted a great influence on the people. One of the most celebrated\r\ntrials of the time was that of the Duchess of Gloucester, who was\r\naccused of bewitching Henry VI. It transpired at the trial that she\r\nhad instructed a priest, named Bolingbroke who practised necromancy,\r\nto bewitch the king; a sorceress named Marie Gardimain being also\r\nimplicated. An effigy of the king in wax was discovered half-melted in\r\nfront of a fire of dry plants, which had been gathered by moonlight in\r\na graveyard. Bolingbroke the necromancer was hanged, Gardimain burnt,\r\nand the Duchess of Gloucester condemned to imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nThe “evil eye” was another form of witchcraft, mostly practised by\r\nwomen. Visions or apparitions in the sky, foretelling some war or\r\ndisaster, were firmly believed in by the Church, and caused great\r\nconsternation. Fiery dragons appearing in the heavens were said to\r\npredict civil war; and we also read of pigs bearing royal crowns, and\r\ngory stars, all of which were doubtless caused by ordinary phenomena\r\nnot understood at that time.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the devil presiding at a sabbath or meeting of\r\nsorcerers is thus described by De Lancre: “He is seated in a black\r\nchair with a crown of black horns, two horns in his neck, and one on\r\nthe forehead, which sheds light on the assembly; the hair bristling,\r\nthe face pale and exhibiting signs of uneasiness, the eyes round,\r\nlarge, and fully opened, inflamed and hideous, with a goat’s beard. The\r\nneck and the rest of the body deformed, and in the shape of a man and\r\na goat; the hands and the feet of a human being.”\r\n\r\nThe word witch is thought by some authorities to be derived from\r\n_chausaph_, which means a user of pharmaceutic enchantments, or an\r\napplier of drugs to magical purposes.\r\n\r\nWitches sent storms and barrenness, drowned children, brought on ague,\r\ncould kill with evil eye, slay with lightning, pass through key-holes,\r\nride through the air on broom-sticks, and perform many other weird and\r\nwondrous things.\r\n\r\n“They were generally old, blear-eyed, wrinkled dames,” says Scott,\r\n“ugly and crippled, frequently papists, and sometimes atheists; of\r\ncross-grained tempers and cynical dispositions.” They were often\r\npoisoners, and generally monomaniacs. Epilepsy and all diseases not\r\nunderstood by the physicians were set down to the influence of witches.\r\nThey were said to make two covenants with the devil, one public and\r\none private. Then the novices were presented to the devil in person,\r\nand instructed to renounce the Christian faith, tread on the Cross,\r\nbreak the fasts, joining hands with Satan, paying him homage, and\r\nyielding him body and soul. Some witches sold themselves for a term of\r\nyears, and some for ever; then they kissed the devil, and signed their\r\nbond with blood, and a banquet ended the meeting; their dances being\r\naccompanied with shouts of “Ha, ha! devil, devil! Dance here, dance\r\nhere! Play here, play here! Sabbath, sabbath!” Before they departed\r\nthe devil was said to give them philtres and amulets. These women were\r\nusually hypochondriacs, often driven by despair and misfortune to\r\nconfess any charge made against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSUPERSTITION AND ITS INFLUENCE ON MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuperstition is a belief in what is wholly opposite to the laws of\r\nthe physical and moral world, and yet supposed to be attainable by\r\nsupernatural agency.\r\n\r\nThe words incantation and charm seem to have been derived from the\r\nancient practice of curing diseases by poetry and music. Democritus\r\nsays that many diseases are capable of being cured by the sound of a\r\nflute when properly played. Marianus Capellus assures us also that\r\nfevers may be cured by suitable songs. Galen believed the sound of the\r\nflute efficacious in gout and epilepsy. Asclepiades actually employed\r\nthe trumpet for the relief of sciatica, and tells us it is to be\r\ncontinued until the fibres of the part begin to palpitate, when the\r\npain will vanish. What terrible visions might be conjured up if such\r\nremedies were used to-day.\r\n\r\nThe influence of superstition on medicine may be accounted for by\r\nthe fact, that from the very first, ideas with regard to the action\r\nof drugs must have been combined with those concerning supernatural\r\nagencies, for the phenomena of nature in very early times were\r\nattributed to spirits. Diseases were supposed to be due to an evil\r\nspirit, therefore to cast the disease out was equivalent to curing\r\nit, and the methods used for this purpose were by no means always\r\nineffective in curing disease.\r\n\r\nIncantations and spells were generally used in addition to a real\r\nremedial agent, but the incantations usually got the credit for\r\neffecting the cure.\r\n\r\nIn early times superstition played an important part in the cure of\r\ndisease, and it prevails to a certain extent to-day. “In the opinion of\r\nthe ignorant multitude,” says Lord Bacon, “witches and impostors have\r\nalways held a competition with physicians.”\r\n\r\nThere has ever been a peculiar propensity in the human mind to foster a\r\nbelief in the supernatural, and perhaps more especially in respect to\r\nmedicine on account of the obscurity and ignorance with which it was\r\nonce surrounded. In early times almost every disease was attributed to\r\npunishment for evil-doing, the working of some demon, or the influence\r\nof the stars; hence the use of any article that was strange or rare as\r\na remedy.\r\n\r\n“The employment of precious stones for medicinal purposes,” writes\r\nDe Boot, “arises from an Arab superstition which supposed them to be\r\nthe residence of spirits.” They were first used as amulets, and then\r\ngradually came to be administered inwardly for various ailments.\r\n\r\n“Mystery is the very soul of empiricism,” says Paris; “withdraw\r\nthe veil, and the confidence of the patient instantly languishes.”\r\nA propensity to attribute every ordinary and natural effect\r\nto extraordinary and unnatural causes, is one of the striking\r\ncharacteristics of medical superstition.\r\n\r\nThe properties that herbs possessed were attributed by the old\r\nphysicians to the planets which were supposed to influence them, and\r\nour medical men to this day head their prescriptions with a sign\r\nthat originally meant an invocation to Jupiter, which is a surviving\r\nrelic of this old superstitious practice. Another very curious fact\r\nwith respect to medical superstition is, that many of the greatest\r\nphilosophers were firm believers in it. Lord Bacon is said to have\r\nbelieved in the existence of a panacea that would prolong life beyond\r\nits natural term. He considered that the principal cause of death\r\nwas the action of the external air in drying and exhausting the\r\nbody, which he thought might be prevented by nitre; but although he\r\ntook three grains of his favourite salt every morning for the last\r\nthirty years of his life, he died at the age of sixty-six. We have\r\nmany customs at the present day which are a survival of the days of\r\nsuperstition, and few have any idea of their origin. The mother, when\r\nshe hangs round the neck of her child the plaything known as a coral\r\nand bells, little imagines she is perpetuating an ancient superstitious\r\npractice. The soothsayers attributed many mystic properties to coral,\r\nand it was believed to ward off the evil eye, and drive away devils and\r\nevil spirits. For this purpose it was suspended from a child’s neck\r\nas an amulet. Pliny and Dioscorides greatly esteemed the medicinal\r\nproperties of coral, and Paracelsus recommends that it should be worn\r\naround the necks of infants to keep away fits, sorcery, charms, and to\r\nserve as an antidote to poisons. The bells usually suspended to it were\r\noriginally intended to frighten away evil spirits, and not to amuse the\r\nchild alone.\r\n\r\nParis mentions a curious circumstance, _viz._, that the same\r\nsuperstitious belief should exist among the negroes of the West Indies,\r\nwho affirm that the colour of coral is always affected by the state of\r\nhealth of the wearer, it becoming paler in disease.\r\n\r\nBut all the remedies that originated in superstition were not entirely\r\nuseless. Some, whether by accident or not, had a natural power of\r\nefficacy, and led to discoveries of importance. In the time of\r\nJames I., a powder known as the sympathetic powder of Sir Kenelm Digby\r\nhad a great reputation for healing wounds. Whenever a wound had been\r\ninflicted, this powder was applied to the weapon which had caused it,\r\nwhich was also smeared with ointment and dressed two or three times a\r\nday. The wound itself was directed to be brought together and carefully\r\nbound up with clean linen rags, but above all to be let alone for seven\r\ndays, at the end of which time it was generally found to be healed.\r\nThis was, of course, said to be due to the wonderful properties of\r\nthe sympathetic powder, instead of the fact of excluding the air from\r\nthe part and not interfering with nature’s own healing powers. The\r\nmysterious sympathetic healing powder was afterwards said to be simply\r\ncalcined green vitriol. The rust of the spear of Telephus, alluded to\r\nby Homer as a cure for the wounds which that weapon inflicted, was\r\nprobably verdigris, and led to the discovery of its use as a surgical\r\ndressing.\r\n\r\nThe cures supposed to be performed by royal touch show the power\r\nof faith over desire, or mind over matter. The royal surgeons who\r\nintroduced the patients to be touched for scrofula, doubtless took care\r\nto choose those who had a tendency to recover, and who, if left to\r\nnature, would probably have gradually recovered. Boswell says that Dr.\r\nJohnson, when thirty months old, was taken by his mother to London to\r\nbe touched by Queen Anne, on the advice of Sir John Floyer, a physician\r\nof Lichfield.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the ignorant have had the most unbounded\r\nconfidence in nauseous remedies, and it would seem as if the nastier\r\nand more disgusting the medicines were, the greater faith they had in\r\nthem. The larger the price asked, the more implicit the faith seemed to\r\nbe. The Collyrium of Danares, a famous quack eye lotion, was sold at\r\nConstantinople for £9 a bottle, and the elixirs sold by Paracelsus and\r\nVan Helmont brought extortionate prices. The doctrine of Signatories,\r\nas it was called, is of very great antiquity. It implied that every\r\nnatural substance which possesses any medicinal virtues, indicates, by\r\nan obvious and well-marked external character, the disease for which it\r\nis a remedy. Thus the bloodstone was used to stop bleeding, on account\r\nof its marks resembling drops of blood. The root of the mandrake, on\r\naccount of its resemblance to the human form, was used as a remedy\r\nfor sterility. Turmeric was administered for jaundice, and poppies\r\nfor diseases of the head. Another belief of the ancients was that all\r\npoisonous bodies possessed a powerful attraction for one another, and\r\nthat “like would cure like”. The hair of a mad dog was worn as a charm\r\nto prevent hydrophobia, and the foot of the ape was used as a remedy\r\nfor its bite. On the same principle we are solemnly assured that three\r\nscruples of the ashes of a witch, after she has been well and carefully\r\nburnt at the stake, is a sure protection against the evil effects of\r\nwitchcraft.\r\n\r\nMany ancient superstitions are so deeply rooted that they find\r\nbelievers among the educated at the present day. Take, for instance,\r\nthe belief that many people have in the efficacy of red flannel. For\r\nsore throat, rheumatism, or swelling, they believe it will cure when\r\nflannel of no other colour will. This belief may be traced to the\r\ncolour of the cloth often used in incantations, which was always red.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country a wedding-ring is still believed to be a\r\nuniversal cure for sore eyes.\r\n\r\nA curious superstition is still practised in some parts of Wales for\r\nthe cure of the complaint called shingles. The term for shingles in\r\nWelsh means “The Eagle.” It was supposed in ancient times that if\r\na person ate of the flesh of the eagle he would never suffer from\r\nshingles, and his direct descendants down to the ninth generation could\r\nnot contract it, and furthermore had the power transmitted to them of\r\ncuring others so afflicted by blowing on them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLOVE PHILTRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLove Philtres were administered for the purpose of inspiring affection\r\nor hatred. In very early times they were frequently used, concocted,\r\nand sold by the magicians or sorcerers, who often obtained large sums\r\nof money in exchange, from amorously-inclined gallants and maidens.\r\nThey were composed of various extraordinary ingredients used in\r\nmedicine at the time, and were either in the form of a powder, which\r\nwas to be surreptitiously slipped into an article of food to be\r\nswallowed, or in a liquid for anointing the clothes or hands, and by\r\nthings to be held in the mouth.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded that some sorcerers even used the Host, upon which\r\nthey traced letters of blood. The following were also used in the\r\npreparation of philtres: the entrails of animals, feathers of birds,\r\nscales of fishes, parings of nails, powdered loadstones, and human\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIt is little wonder they excited hatred. The _poculum amatorium_ or\r\nlove philtre of the Romans, and the _philtron_ of the Greeks, were\r\nvenerated with superstitious awe in early times. They became used to\r\nsuch an extent by the former nation under the first emperors, that\r\na decree was promulgated under the Roman criminal law whereby love\r\nphiltres were deemed as poison, and the punishment inflicted on those\r\nusing them was very severe. Hairs from a wolf’s tail, the bones of the\r\nleft side of a toad which had been eaten by ants (those of the right\r\nside were used to cause hatred), the blood of pigeons, skeletons of\r\nsnakes, the entrails of animals, and other equally disgusting things,\r\nwere included as ingredients in Roman love philtres.\r\n\r\nPliny states, that there were also philtres for quenching love. Thus,\r\n“if a nest of young swallows is placed in a box and buried, on being\r\ndug up after a few days it will be found that some of the birds have\r\ndied with their beaks closed, while others die as if gasping for\r\nbreath”. The latter were used for exciting love, and the former for\r\nproducing the opposite effect.\r\n\r\nHorace recommends a bone torn from a hungry and voracious dog, and\r\nVirgil describes a complete apparatus wherewith a maiden seeks to\r\nrecover the affections of a faithless lover.\r\n\r\nThe early Greek and Roman magicians used “hippomanes,” which was\r\nthe lump of flesh found in the head of a colt newly foaled, as an\r\ningredient in their philtres.\r\n\r\nAbout the sixteenth century philtres came to be compounded and sold\r\nby the apothecaries, who doubtless derived from them a lucrative\r\nprofit. Favourite ingredients with these later practitioners were\r\nmandragora, cantharides, and vervain, which were supposed to have\r\nSatanic properties. They were mixed with other herbs said to have an\r\naphrodisiac effect; also man’s gall, the eyes of a black cat, and the\r\nblood of a lapwing, bat, or goat.\r\n\r\nIn Gay’s _Shepherds’ Week_ reference is thus made to love philtres:—\r\n\r\n    “Strait to the ’pothecary’s shop I went,\r\n    And in love powder all my money spent;\r\n    Behap what will next Sunday after prayers\r\n    When to the alehouse Lubberkin repairs,\r\n    These flies into his mug I’ll throw,\r\n    And soon the swain with fervent love shall glow”.\r\n\r\n“Botanomancy,” Ferrand states, “which is done by the noise or crackling\r\nthat kneeholme, box, or bay leaves make when they are crushed betwixt\r\none’s hands or cast into the fire, was of old in use among the pagans,\r\nwho were wont to bruise poppy flowers betwixt their hands, and by this\r\nmeans thinking to know their loves.”\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHARME OR AN ALLAY FOR LOVE.\r\n\r\n    “If so be a toad be laid\r\n    In a sheepskin newly flaid,\r\n    And that ty’d to man ’twill sever\r\n    Him and his affections ever.”—Herrick’s _Hesperides_.\r\n\r\nThe winged ant was another favourite ingredient in love philtres, and\r\nwas first used by Rhazes, who prepared the winged ant in the form\r\nof tincture by maceration in alcohol. This tincture, dropped in the\r\nhomœopathic manner into wine or mixed with food, was supposed to have\r\na wonderful action in producing symptoms of the tender passion in the\r\ncoldest hearts. The winged ants alone were used in this preparation,\r\nwhich enjoyed a long reputation, and was subsequently known as\r\n“Hoffmann’s Water of Magnanimity,” and largely used in the seventeenth\r\ncentury as an aphrodisiac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PIONEERS OF PHARMACY AND BOTANY—PHYSIC GARDENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operation of distillation was unknown to the ancient Greeks and\r\nRomans, although Dioscorides and Pliny describe a process which may\r\nbe considered that of distillation in its infancy. The process was\r\nnot known in England until the time of Henry II. To the Arabs we are\r\nindebted for the discovery of manna, cassia, senna, and rhubarb, also\r\naromatics, such as musk, nutmeg, mace, and cloves. Blisters were known\r\nand used by the Arabs, who are the first also on record to mention\r\nsugar extracted from the cane, and sugar-candy, which they called honey\r\nof cane.\r\n\r\nRhazes and Avicenna were the first physicians to introduce improvements\r\nin pharmaceutical preparations. The latter was the first to mention\r\nthe three mineral acids, and distinguish between vegetable and mineral\r\nalkalies.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1226, Roger Bacon, a native of Ilchester, in Somersetshire,\r\nand a Franciscan monk, may be said to have laid the foundation of\r\nchemical science in Europe. He was excommunicated by Pope Nicholas,\r\nand imprisoned for ten years for supposed dealings with the devil.\r\nHe professed to have discovered an elixir of life, which he affirmed\r\nprevented corruption of any constitution and the infirmities of age for\r\nmany years. Following Bacon, at the end of the thirteenth century, came\r\nArnoldas de Villa Nova, or Villeneuve, who was the first to recommend\r\nthe distilled spirit of wine impregnated with certain herbs, from which\r\nwe date our use of tinctures in medicine.\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine followed as a pioneer in the administration of metallic\r\nmedicines; he made volatile alkali from sal-ammoniac, and noticed the\r\nproduction of ether from alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1493, Phillipus Theophrastus, Bombast of Hohenheim,\r\nafterwards known as Paracelsus, was born near Zurich in Switzerland, a\r\nman of extraordinary conceit and boldness, but who wrought a greater\r\nchange and influence in _materia medica_ than any physician since\r\nthe time of Galen. He travelled all over Europe, and so obtained an\r\nextensive knowledge of chemistry and medicine.\r\n\r\nThis genius of science and quackery, for such Paracelsus must be\r\ntermed, who scoffed at all the doctrines believed in since the time of\r\nHippocrates, professed to have received his knowledge from the Divine\r\nBeing Himself. His sheer impudence carried the sympathies of the public\r\nwith him, and they kissed the skirts of his gown as he passed through\r\nthe streets, whilst he had among his followers many princes and nobles.\r\n\r\nHe denounced the apothecaries, who, he said, “could only compose\r\ninsipid syrups and repulsive concoctions, when they have ready to hand\r\nat the bottom of their stills, extracts and dyes derived from the best\r\nvegetables and minerals”. He disagreed with the doctors also, whose\r\nprescriptions he stigmatised as barbarous, and was much against the\r\nuse of correctives being added to pharmaceutical recipes when they\r\nhad no natural relation to the preparation itself. He believed in the\r\nexistence of an active principle in plants, which he termed the “Ether\r\nof Aristotle,” that could be isolated and used to avert the various\r\ndisorders of the human body—an idea which is now the leading spirit\r\nin pharmaceutical research. His labours did much to stimulate the\r\npractical side of chemistry, though his language was mysterious, as,\r\nlike other alchemists, he wrapped up all his wisdom and his ignorance\r\nin the garb of allegory. He was reported to carry about a familiar\r\nspirit in the pommel of a long sword that always hung at his side.\r\n\r\nParacelsus is said to have been the first to use mercury internally;\r\nhe also employed opium, antimony, and lead largely in his treatment;\r\nand devised a process for the preparation of red oxide of mercury. He\r\nwas sent for to many of the European Courts, and by the interest of\r\nErasmus was made Professor of Chemistry at Bale, the first chair that\r\nwas established in Europe. It was here while seated in his chair, that\r\nwith arrogant impudence he burnt with great solemnity the writings of\r\nGalen and Avicenna, saying that “if God would not impart the secrets of\r\nphysic, it was not only allowable, but was justifiable, to consult the\r\ndevil”.\r\n\r\nHe had the greatest contempt for his fellow physicians, and said he had\r\nmore knowledge in the very down on his bald pate than was in all their\r\nwritings, and in the buckles of his shoes there was more learning than\r\nin Galen and Avicenna, and in his beard more experience than all their\r\nuniversities. The man was a mass of conceit and egotism, yet feared and\r\nliked by the people for his boldness.\r\n\r\nLatterly he took to drinking heavily, seldom taking off his clothes for\r\nmany nights together. At length he broke down, and the end came at\r\nthe age of forty-eight, when this singular man died after a few hours’\r\nillness at Saltzburg, in Austria, a bottle of his boasted panacea for\r\nall ills being found in his pocket. He believed the human body to be\r\ncomposed of salt, sulphur, and mercury, and that in these “three fast\r\nsubstances” health and disease consist. To give Paracelsus his due,\r\nalthough empiricism and quackery were the chief elements in his career,\r\nhe exerted an undoubted influence on the medical practice of his time,\r\nand with all his egotism did his best to advance the science and art of\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nThe next pioneer was Van Helmont, who flourished some hundred years\r\nlater. He was the first to notice the existence of gases, also to\r\nuse alum in uterine hæmorrhage, through which he acquired a great\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nLittle was known of _materia medica_ by the nations of the West from\r\nthe eighth to the tenth century. The chief cultivation of medicinal\r\nherbs took place in the monasteries, each having its own botanical\r\ngarden, which contributed much to the progress of medicine. At this\r\ntime the knowledge of the medicinal value of herbs and roots was\r\nmuch more advanced in the East, and we find that during the reign\r\nof Almansour, in the eighth century, a large school was founded at\r\nBagdad, which became a refuge for scientists when exiled from Athens\r\nand Alexandria. The works of Aristotle and Galen were translated into\r\nSyriac, and the greatest generosity and encouragement were shown to\r\n_savants_ who settled there. Before this the Arabs had considerable\r\nknowledge of the use of plants in medicine, and had made some valuable\r\ndiscoveries. Their physicians recommended the use of senna, tamarinds,\r\nand cassia in place of the violent purgatives used by the Greek\r\nphysicians, and a number of new plants were introduced by Rhazes from\r\nIndia, Persia, and Syria. Mesué wrote his treatise on medicine (_De\r\nRemedica_), which, on being translated into Latin, was used as a manual\r\nin all the schools up to the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nConstantine was the first to introduce the most noted Arabic works\r\ninto Europe, himself a writer of no little repute. Then several Arab\r\ntravellers added to the store of knowledge; among these, Ebor-Taitor,\r\na native of Malaga, travelled in Asia to study plants, and eventually\r\nbecame minister of the Caliph at Cairo.\r\n\r\nOtho, of Cremona, in a poem of 1500 lines, contributed his knowledge\r\nof plants, and John of Milan, in his _Code of the School of Salerno_,\r\ncompiled the discoveries of a century in medical botany.\r\n\r\nComing to the twelfth century, scientific progress was not so rapid,\r\nyet all the investigation that was made originated in the study of\r\nmedicine. Most of the monasteries and convents besides their botanical\r\ngardens, had collections of minerals and animals, which were carefully\r\nwatched and tended, and the monks and nuns would not only administer\r\nto the sick of their own orders, but also to the suffering who claimed\r\ntheir charity. Once lodged there, the treatment was good and wholesome,\r\nand consisted mostly of decoctions of simples, backed up by good\r\nkitchen medicine, quietness, and rest. One or two monks who had a\r\nspecial knowledge of herbs were usually allotted to this department.\r\nIt can then hardly be wondered at, that during the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries most of the records we have of medicine are from\r\nworks by the brethren of the monasteries. An excellent collection of\r\nrecipes, comprising also a summary of plants, animals, and minerals was\r\ncompiled by Hildegarde, Abbess of Bingen, and called the _Jardin de\r\nSanté_.\r\n\r\nThis good lady, like many other abbesses of her time, was much\r\ninterested in the art of healing. She cultivated her own medicinal\r\nplants, and carefully noted down their properties for the use of\r\nothers, and thus left a valuable record.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century an advance was made in _materia medica_ by\r\nGilbert and Hernicus Arviell, two Englishmen who travelled through Asia\r\nto study plants and their uses. Simon de Cordo, called Simon of Genoa,\r\nalso took a botanising exploration into Sicily and the islands of the\r\nArchipelago, and afterwards wrote a botanic dictionary.\r\n\r\nAnother eminent botanist of this period was Peter de Crescenzi, a man\r\nof good birth and fortune, who was born at Bologna in 1330, and who\r\ngreatly interested himself in botany and horticulture. His great work,\r\nwhich was translated into several languages, was called _Opus Rubarium\r\nCommodorum_. Contemporary with Peter were three names we must not omit,\r\n_viz._, Vincent de Beauvais, Albertus Magnus, and Arnaud de Villeneuve,\r\nwho professed a knowledge of alchemy, astrology, and physic. Vincent\r\nde Beauvais was a Dominican monk, and his great work, the _Speculum\r\nNaturale_, is saturated with the superstition of the time. In this book\r\nhe states, “the mandragora is of the same shape as the human body; the\r\nwinged dragon is capable of carrying off an ox, and devouring the same\r\nwhilst flying”. He also describes the scythion lamb, a sort of animal\r\nplant which had roots and grew in the ground, and other fearsome\r\ncreatures, and declared that “in Scotland the fruits of certain trees,\r\nwhen they fall into the water, produce the birds called black divers”.\r\nVilleneuve wrote many treatises on plants and animals, and eventually\r\nbecame teacher of medicine and botany at the University of Paris. He\r\nwas undoubtedly a man in advance of his time, and boldly declared “that\r\nthe most solemn mysteries of the Catholic faith could be explained by\r\nthe teachings of natural history and experimental physics”.\r\n\r\nHe was therefore accused by the magistrates of sorcery and magic, but\r\nescaped through the special protection of Charles of Anjou into Italy,\r\nwhere he settled for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth century saw little advance in the medical art, but it\r\nwas enriched by one or two great works. One of these, written in Latin\r\nby Bartholomew Glanvil, an English monk, was a kind of encyclopædia of\r\nimmense size, and was called _Liber de Proprietatibus Rerum_, and had a\r\ngreat reputation for centuries afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe advent of printing about the middle of the fifteenth century\r\nrapidly spread the knowledge of more recent discoveries throughout\r\nEurope, and many large works on botany and herbalism, illustrated\r\nwith woodcuts, were published at Mayence and Louvain. At Venice\r\nmany of the works of the old Arab physicians, Avicenna, Mesué, and\r\nothers, were printed and eagerly purchased. The discovery of America\r\nin 1492 heralded the introduction of numerous fresh additions to\r\n_materia medica_, which were brought to this country by explorers and\r\nnaturalists.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century, by the labours and researches of George\r\nAgricola, a German, and Conrad Gesner, a Swiss, a considerable advance\r\nwas made in the knowledge of what was called chemical medicine and\r\nbotany. Agricola, who was the greatest mineralogist the world had then\r\nseen, explored and spent much time in the mines of Bohemia and Saxony,\r\nand thus obtained a practical knowledge of the then known methods of\r\nthe working of metals. His contemporary, Conrad Gesner, born at Zurich\r\nin 1516, has been called the originator of scientific botany, as he was\r\nthe first to discover a method of recognising each genus and kind by\r\nexamining the organs of fructification, and in this way discovered 1800\r\nnew varieties. A famous physic garden was planted in Paris in the early\r\npart of the seventeenth century by Jacques Gohory, an enthusiastic\r\npharmacist, and this garden eventually became part of the _Jardin des\r\nPlantes_. In connection with this garden a school of medicine was\r\nfounded, the first occupant of the chair of chemistry being William\r\nDavisson, a Scotchman, and predecessor to Lefebvre, who afterwards\r\nbecame a chemist at St. James’s.\r\n\r\nThe practice of the teachers of this time was to dictate to their\r\nstudents, and in order to save themselves the trouble of dictating\r\nand the students the trouble of writing, which was a very laborious\r\nmatter in those days, the lecturer would write a book. Thus Jean Beguin\r\nwrote a chemical text-book in 1612, which passed through no fewer than\r\nfifty-three editions.\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention two other pioneers of this period, who\r\nmade important discoveries in botany; they were Matthias of Lille,\r\nwho eventually settled in England, and Andrew Cesalpin, professor of\r\nbotany at Pisa. The former first formulated the true principles of\r\nclassification of plants and arrangement into families, such as the\r\norchids, palms, and mosses; and to the latter belongs the honour of\r\nhaving devised the first system of botany. Having compared the process\r\nof generation in animals to the seeds of plants, he distinguished male\r\nplants by their stamens, and those which yielded seed as female.\r\n\r\nThe next era is marked by the publication of the first pharmacopœia\r\nat Nuremberg in 1542. “For this act,” says Paris, “we are indebted\r\nto Valerius Cordus, a young student, who, during a transient visit at\r\nthat place, accidentally produced a collection of medical receipts\r\nwhich he had selected from the works of the past esteemed writers, and\r\nwith which the physicians of Nuremberg were so highly pleased that\r\nthey urged him to print it for the benefit of the apothecaries, and\r\nobtained the sanction of the Senate to the undertaking.” To this slight\r\ncircumstance we owe the institution of pharmacopœias. The first\r\n_London Pharmacopœia_ was, however, not published until the reign\r\nof James I., in 1618, of which there were twelve subsequent editions,\r\nthe last being in 1841. The _Dublin Pharmacopœia_ first appeared\r\nin 1807, the last edition being published in 1850. Until the Medical\r\nAct passed in 1858, the right of publishing the _Pharmacopœia_ for\r\nEngland, Scotland, and Ireland was vested in the College of Physicians\r\nof London, Edinburgh, and Ireland respectively; and as these books\r\ncontained several preparations similar in name and different in\r\nstrength, such obvious danger arose for travellers that the _British\r\nPharmacopœia_, published in 1864, became, by Act of Parliament, the\r\nstandard for Great Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Chelsea Physic Garden is the oldest public botanical garden in\r\nGreat Britain, but there were private ones of older date, such as that\r\nof Gerard, the author of _The Herbal_, which was situated in Holborn,\r\nand that of Tradescant, the famous Dutch traveller, gardener to\r\nJames I., who had an extensive garden of exotic plants in Lambeth.\r\n\r\nThe founders of the Chelsea Garden were the members of the Society of\r\nApothecaries, who have maintained it for over two centuries entirely\r\nfor scientific purposes, as was stipulated in the deed of gift,\r\nexecuted by Sir Hans Sloane, in which the growing or cultivation of\r\nplants for purely pharmaceutical purposes, or for trade, was strictly\r\nforbidden. The origin of this so-called Physic Garden was somewhat\r\namusing, and anything but scientific. The ground was first fixed upon\r\nas an eligible spot for building a boathouse for the state barge of\r\nthe Apothecaries’ Company. This ground was walled in about 1674, and\r\nplanted with trees in 1678, and herbs were grown in it for use in the\r\ncompany’s laboratories, some of these plants being from time to time\r\nexchanged for others from the University of Leyden. Sir Hans (then Dr.)\r\nSloane bought the estate in 1712; and, as might have been expected of\r\na man of his parts, a pupil of the chemist Stahl and of the botanist\r\nTournefort, and a friend of the great Ray, a new era of usefulness was\r\nbegun in the Chelsea Garden. In 1722 he handed over the land to the\r\nApothecaries’ Society, at a yearly rental of £5, and an undertaking\r\nthat fifty specimens of fifty species of distinct plants, well dried\r\nand mounted as herbarium specimens and properly named, should be\r\nhanded over to the Royal Society each year until 2000 had been duly\r\ndelivered. In a catalogue issued in 1730, written by Miller, the head\r\ngardener, are enumerated 499 plants, mostly medicinal, so one may judge\r\nof the extent of the gardens at that time. Exotics were cultivated in\r\nhothouses in 1732, and in 1736 Linnæus paid a visit to the garden.\r\n\r\nThomas Dover, the originator of Dover’s powder, was born in England in\r\nthe year 1660. He settled and practised medicine for a time in Bristol;\r\nleft there for a period, and returned again. He lived with, and was\r\ncontemporaneous with Sydenham. He gained much professional reputation\r\non the occasion of a severe epidemic of fever. This may have suggested\r\nto him the use of ipecacuanha and opium in a compound.\r\n\r\nIn Dover’s day and time, the apothecaries were in the ascendancy, being\r\nthe medical practitioners, whilst the physicians were chiefly called in\r\nto attend in childbirth and protracted illness. Indeed, it is naïvely\r\nstated that the apothecary surgeons rode in their chaises, while the\r\ndoctors _walked_, and that the former were generally first consulted\r\nwhen the choice of a family physician was to be made. Mercury had\r\nat this time an unrestrained use—perhaps _abuse_ would be a better\r\nword,—and much severe public stricture was made upon the fact. Crude\r\nquicksilver was administered, and Dover was a warm advocate of its\r\nuse—in fact, he was called the _quicksilver doctor_. One Captain\r\nHenry Coit, a patient of Dover’s, took an ounce and a quarter of crude\r\nmercury daily, until he had used more than two pounds weight! Dover\r\nprofessed to believe that mercury freed the patient from all vermicular\r\ndiseases, opened all obstructions, and made a pure balsam of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe doctors and apothecaries were at loggerheads. Dover said the best\r\nway to affront the latter was to order too little physic—each patient\r\nbeing deemed to be worth a certain sum to the dispenser.\r\n\r\nIn 1708 Dover joined the company of a group of Bristol merchants\r\nin a scheme to fit out two vessels for privateering in the South\r\nSeas. Dover, it seems, went as captain, and the voyage was eminently\r\nsuccessful in booty. They took in various reprisals from the\r\nSpaniards—the hoards of treasure and gold which they in turn had\r\nobtained from the native Indians—the principle of _might_ applied to\r\n_right_. The expedition returned to Britain enriched with spoil, the\r\ntreasure amounting to £170,000 sterling. It was during this memorable\r\nvoyage that Dover, landing with some of his crew on the island of Juan\r\nFernandez, discovered the existence of Alexander Selkirk—Robinson\r\nCrusoe—in his dreary solitude on this desert shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nAMULETS, TALISMANS AND CHARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom very remote times a somewhat curious link has existed between the\r\nart of healing and religion, and those who proposed the cure of the\r\nbody or the soul have ever sought to work upon that uncanny chord we\r\ncall superstition, which pervades more or less all classes of mankind.\r\nThe influence of superstition manifested itself in many ways, and\r\namong others the belief in amulets, talismans and charms survives even\r\nto-day. Two thousand years ago they were dispensed by the priests, and\r\nafterwards by those who practised medicine, alchemy, and astrology,\r\nduring the middle ages, when medical practice was mainly composed of a\r\nmixture of white magic, witchcraft, and religion.\r\n\r\nAn amulet consisted of an object in wood, stone, or metal, carved or\r\npainted; also certain words or signs, written or spoken, which were\r\nsupposed to possess some mysterious virtue or hidden property, and\r\navert disease and death from the wearer. The word means something\r\nthat is suspended from the neck, or bound round a part of the body,\r\nto strengthen it; to drive off disease or poison, bringing about\r\ncertain results of a peculiar character, and invested with supernatural\r\nvirtues. Portions of animals and herbs were also used for this purpose.\r\nTalismans were objects, usually of metal or one of the precious stones,\r\nworn about the person to ward off danger, ill-luck, or the evil eye, as\r\nwell as for their supposed medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nBy their means it was thought possible to hold commune with the world\r\nof spirits. Their origin is lost in antiquity, but they were used by\r\nthe Assyrians, Egyptians, Persians, and Jews hundreds of years before\r\nthe Christian era, and afterwards by the Greeks and Romans. It is\r\nprobable the Jews learned the use of amulets from the Egyptians at\r\nthe time of the captivity, by whom they were very generally worn.\r\nEgyptian amulets were mostly composed of stone or porcelain objects,\r\nfashioned in various forms. Some were emblematic of deities, such as\r\nthe nilometer, which was a symbol of Osiris, while others represented\r\nhuman heads or the figures of animals. Many were engraved with zodiacal\r\nsymbols which had special significance. The crab was worn to ward off\r\nfevers, the bull to guard against the evil-doing of others, fishes\r\nkept away gout and kindred diseases, and the scorpion rendered the\r\nwearer invulnerable to the bites or stings of venomous reptiles. It was\r\ncustomary with the Egyptians to attach certain amulets to the bodies\r\nof the dead to protect them from evil spirits, and they are frequently\r\nfound suspended from the necks of mummies. Amulets are worn in Egypt\r\nto-day, and also in most Mohammedan countries. They usually take the\r\nform of a small strip of parchment, on which is written some cabalistic\r\nsign or a few lines from the Koran, the whole being enclosed in a small\r\nleather or tin case, and hung around the neck. Amulets were also known\r\nand much used by the early Greeks. Pliny mentions their virtue, while\r\nGalen, Dioscorides, Cardamus, and other ancient writers on medicine,\r\nspeak of their value in warding off disease. Galen tells us that the\r\nEgyptian king, Nechepsus, who lived 630 years B.C., wore a green\r\njasper cut into the form of a dragon, surrounded with rays, which,\r\napplied externally to the region of the digestive organs, was said to\r\nwonderfully strengthen that part. The Romans were also great believers\r\nin the power of the amulet, and in the declining era of the great\r\nempire the custom of wearing them became so general that the Emperor\r\nCaracalla made a public edict, that no man should wear an amulet about\r\nhis person, under heavy penalties.\r\n\r\nAmulets have been known to that curious nation the Chinese from the\r\nearliest period of their history, and are still worn by them. They are\r\nsold by the priests in the form of small pieces of metal, chains, or\r\ncharacters written on a piece of skin or parchment, and worn as a charm\r\nagainst accident, sickness, etc.\r\n\r\nTo enumerate all the extraordinary objects used as amulets in early\r\ntimes, and the wonderful virtues attached to them, would fill a volume,\r\nso we must be content to mention a few of the most curious.\r\n\r\nThe amulets and talismans probably held in the highest esteem were\r\nthose in the form of precious stones. They were supposed to be\r\ninfluenced in some mysterious way by the planets, and to be the abode\r\nof spirits. Five or six hundred years ago a lady would present her\r\nknight with a talisman on his departure on some adventurous or warlike\r\nexpedition; this often took the form of a jewel set in the hilt of his\r\nsword. The diamond was thus supposed to endow the wearer with courage,\r\nand make him more fearless than careful. A jacinth had the reputation\r\nof being able to strengthen the heart, and was often worn close to\r\nthe region of that organ, fashioned into the form of some animal or\r\nsaint. The sapphire was supposed to possess a Divine gift of sharpening\r\nthe intellect, and was also worn as a preventive against the bites of\r\nvenomous animals. A wearer of this stone was also said to have the\r\npower of resisting “necromantick apparitions”. The emerald was worn\r\nin a ring to prevent giddiness and strengthen the memory. Garcious\r\nquaintly states: “It takes away vain and foolish fears as of devils\r\nand hobgoblins, folly and anger, and causeth good conditions; if it do\r\nso being worn about one, reason will tell him, that being beaten into\r\npowder and taken inwardly it will do much more”. Great faith was placed\r\nin the ruby as an amulet to ward off plagues and pestilences. Cardamus\r\nsays: “It has the power of making the wearer cheerful, and banishing\r\nidle and foolish thoughts”. The amethyst was supposed to promote\r\ntemperance and sobriety, and cause the wearer to abstain from strong\r\ndrinks and from taking too much sleep. By other writers it is also\r\nsaid to quicken the wit and repel vapours from the head—altogether\r\na very useful kind of amulet to have about. The chrysolite was said\r\nto ward off fevers; while the onyx, worn round the neck, was supposed\r\nto prevent an attack of epilepsy. The opal was believed to cure weak\r\neyes, and the topaz to cure inflammation and keep the wearer from\r\nsleep-walking. Lapis-lazuli, worn as a jewel, was said to make the\r\nwearer fortunate and rich, while amulets of jasper resisted fevers\r\nand dropsy. Ancient warriors often carried an amulet composed of\r\nbloodstone, which was supposed to stop bleeding when applied to a\r\nwound. The old Egyptian amulets were mostly carved in stone, porcelain,\r\ncarnelian, or lapis-lazuli, etc. They were fashioned in many forms, the\r\nmost common being the heart, the symbolic eye, two fingers, disc and\r\nhorns, snakes, the tat, and the papyrus sceptre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tat. The Heart. The Pillow. The Eye. Two Fingers.\r\nPapyrus Sceptre.\r\n\r\nANCIENT EGYPTIAN AMULETS OF GOLD AND CLAY FOUND IN MUMMY CASES.]\r\n\r\nComing to those fashioned in metal, amulets of gold were also highly\r\nesteemed. The precious metal was supposed to strengthen the heart,\r\ndrive away melancholy, fever, and other infirmities. Silver was\r\nattributed with the possession of similar properties, but in a lesser\r\ndegree. Zoroaster and Paracelsus advocated the use of metallic amulets.\r\nSpecial value was attached to those made from a peculiar metal called\r\n_electron_, which was composed of seven metals fused together in fixed\r\nproportions. Amulet rings were always worn on the third finger, which\r\nwas called the medicine-finger by alchemists, through which they\r\nbelieved the heart was most susceptible to influence. Written amulets\r\nusually consisted of some cabalistic character, or a few words written\r\non a small piece of skin or parchment. This was either enclosed in\r\na tiny case and suspended from the neck, or bound against the body.\r\nIt was not uncommon for the physician of the fifteenth century to\r\nwrite his prescription in mysterious characters, and hang it round\r\nthe neck of the patient, or bind it over the part nearest the seat\r\nof the complaint. Of written amulets perhaps the most famous formula\r\nwas Abracadabra, which, when written on a piece of parchment in the\r\nfollowing manner, was said to protect the wearer from most diseases:—\r\n\r\n  A B R A C A D A B R A\r\n   A B R A C A D A B R\r\n    A B R A C A D A B\r\n     A B R A C A D A\r\n      A B R A C A D\r\n       A B R A C A\r\n        A B R A C\r\n         A B R A\r\n          A B R\r\n           A B\r\n            A\r\n\r\nAnother common formula was the sign A II, which, inscribed on\r\nparchment, was worn round the neck to prevent sore eyes. Others were\r\ncomposed of astrological signs and certain numbers. A favourite\r\ninscription was A B R A X A S, supposed to ward off fever and\r\npestilence.\r\n\r\nThe Jews used the fifth and sixth verses of the sixteenth Psalm as\r\nan amulet to discover hidden thieves, it being supposed that on\r\nrepeating these words they would be compelled to come forth from their\r\nhiding-places. The modern burglar requires an amulet of a somewhat\r\nstronger nature in these prosaic days. A curious charm for warts,\r\nused some 400 years ago, was to write on seven little wafers the\r\nfollowing words: Maximanus, Walchus, Johannes, Martinianus, Dionysius,\r\nConstantius, Serapion, and sing a prescribed incantation first into\r\none ear, then into the other, and then above the patient’s poll, after\r\nwhich a virgin was to hang the incantation around the patient’s neck,\r\nwhen the warts would disappear. Another amulet to charm away warts was\r\nan iron ring made from the chain of a gibbet. The following incantation\r\nwas supposed to stop bleeding from the nose: Make the sign of the Cross\r\nthrice, repeat the Lord’s Prayer thrice; then say the _Ave Maria_, and\r\nrepeat the words Max, Hackx, Lyacx, Iseus, Christus. Among the many\r\nstrange and curious articles worn as amulets the old philosophers seem\r\nto have had the greatest veneration for certain mysterious stones, such\r\nas bezoar, the origin of which in most cases is exceedingly doubtful.\r\nDark and weird are the legends relating to the power of the toadstone,\r\nthat amulet so highly prized by witches and astrologers. Among other\r\nproperties it was supposed to protect its owner from the bites of\r\nvenomous animals. Lemnius tells us of “a stone of the bigness of a\r\nbean, to be found in the gizzard of an old cock, which makes him that\r\nwears it beloved, constant, bold, and valiant in fighting and sports”.\r\nSuch amulets brought big prices, and were eagerly sought after. The\r\ntoadstone was much esteemed as a charm against the bites of snakes and\r\nreptiles; it also had a reputation for curing weak eyes and headache.\r\nOrpheus believed that when this amulet was worn by a public speaker he\r\ncould always compel and hold the attention of his audience. A charm\r\nagainst the evil eye consisted of a quill filled with mercury, sealed\r\nat each end, and worn bound to the body. A small portion of the plant\r\ncalled St. John’s Wort was carried about the person as a preventive\r\nfrom harm by witches or devils. A toad, well dried in the sun, put into\r\na bag and hung round the neck, low enough to touch the region of the\r\nheart, was used to allay hæmorrhage; and a very well salted herring\r\nsplit open and applied to the soles of the feet was a noted remedy for\r\nague. An emerald suspended from the neck was worn as an amulet to ward\r\noff the same complaint. _Aqua divina_, a famous remedy, supposed to\r\npossess “magnetick power,” was prepared by macerating a human body in\r\nwater and distilling it twice or thrice. Human bones, various parts\r\nof a mummy, and other equally gruesome objects, were supposed to be\r\nendowed with some mysterious power to ward off accident, disease, and\r\ndeath. In some parts of the country, especially in Cornwall, eel skins\r\nwere and are still used, tied round the legs to prevent cramp; and\r\ntwo sticks laid crosswise on the bedroom floor were supposed to charm\r\naway the same painful complaint. It is still a common custom in other\r\ncountry districts to pass a weakly child through the split branch of a\r\ntree in order to make it grow stronger; and a certain class have the\r\nstrongest belief in a charm of a romantic nature that is worked with\r\nthe gum called dragon’s blood.\r\n\r\nA famous amulet, the remarkable history of which inspired Sir Walter\r\nScott to write _The Talisman_, was “The Lee Penny,” which we believe is\r\nstill in existence, and held in veneration in some parts of Scotland.\r\nThe singular history attached to this coin was as follows: Sir Simon\r\nLockhart, of Lee and Cartland, was a well-known knight in the time of\r\nRobert the Bruce and his son David. He was one of the chief Scottish\r\nknights who accompanied Lord Douglas on his expedition to the Holy\r\nLand with the heart of King Robert Bruce, and was there engaged in the\r\nwar with the Saracens. Tradition goes on to state that he captured in\r\nbattle an emir of great rank and wealth, and fixed a price at which\r\nhe should be ransomed. The aged mother of the prisoner came to the\r\nChristian camp to redeem her son, and on pulling out a large purse\r\nwhich contained the ransom, a peculiar pebble inserted in a coin fell\r\nto the ground. The old woman, it is said, showed such haste and anxiety\r\nto recover it, that it gave the Scottish knight a high idea of its\r\nvalue—on which he refused to set the emir at liberty till the amulet\r\nwas added to the ransom. This the woman consented to do, and also\r\nexplained to Sir Simon the use of the talisman, which was of great\r\nrepute. When dipped in water the liquid assumed the properties of a\r\nstyptic and a febrifuge, etc. Sir Simon Lockhart, after much experience\r\nof its value, brought it home, and left it to his heirs, and it is\r\nknown as the “Lee penny” from the name of his native place. The coin\r\nis said to be of the early Byzantine period. The most remarkable part\r\nof its history, as stated in the introduction to _The Talisman_, was,\r\nthat it escaped condemnation in an extraordinary manner when the Church\r\nof Scotland impeached many other cures of the kind which savoured of\r\nthe miraculous, as occasioned by sorcery, and censured the appeal to\r\nthem; “excepting only that to the amulet called the ‘Lee penny,’ to\r\nwhich it had pleased God to annex certain healing virtues which the\r\nChurch did not presume to condemn”. It still exists, and its powers are\r\nsometimes yet resorted to.\r\n\r\nFor epilepsy, a curious custom was to take the sick man by the hand and\r\nwhisper softly in his ear, “I conjure thee by the sun and moon, and by\r\nthe Gospel of the day delivered by God to Hubert, Giles, Cornelius, and\r\nJohn, that thou rise and fall no more”.\r\n\r\nWhen picking simples for burns the following charm was repeated:—\r\n\r\n    “Hail to the holy herb,\r\n    Growing on the ground,\r\n    All in the Mount Calvary,\r\n    First wert thou found.\r\n    Thou art good for many a sore,\r\n    And heal’st many a wound;\r\n    In the name of Sweet Jesus,\r\n    I take thee from the ground.”\r\n\r\nTo produce sleep, the following is recommended to be repeated:—\r\n\r\n        “In nomine Patris up and down,\r\n    Et filii et spiritus sancte upon my crown,\r\n        Dear Christ upon my breast,\r\n        Sweet Lady, send me eternal rest”.\r\n\r\nThe following was supposed to stop the flux:—\r\n\r\n    “In the blood of Adam death was taken,\r\n    In the blood of Christ it was all to slaken,\r\n    And by the same blood I do thee charge\r\n    That thou do run no longer at large”.\r\n\r\nSingular virtues were supposed to be attached to a “dead man’s hand”.\r\nIn a Roman Catholic chapel in Ashton-in-Mackerfield, there is preserved\r\nwith great care in a white silk bag, a hand, which is still held in\r\nveneration, and wonderful cures are said to have been wrought by this\r\nghastly relic.\r\n\r\nThe hand is said to have been that of one Father Edmund Arrowsmith, who\r\nwas executed at Lancaster in 1628, for apparently no greater offence\r\nthan that of being true to his faith. After his execution one of his\r\nfriends cut off his right hand, which was preserved for many years at\r\nBryn Hall, in Lancashire, and afterwards removed to Ashton.\r\n\r\nThis “Holy hand” was formerly held in great esteem in Lancashire, and\r\npilgrims came from all parts of the country to receive its touch,\r\nwhich was reputed to cure various diseases. It was believed to remove\r\ntumours when rubbed over the part, and restore health to the paralysed.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious superstition still prevalent in some parts of\r\nLancashire, that when cat’s hair gets into the stomach it causes\r\nsickness, which may be cured by eating a piece of egg-shell once a day.\r\n\r\nConsumption was believed by the ignorant to be produced by drinking\r\nwater which had been boiled too long. The cure was to dig a hole in\r\nthe earth, lie in it face downwards, and breathe into the soil. This\r\nextraordinary remedy was also largely used for coughs, asthma, and\r\nthose suffering from hysteria.\r\n\r\nA curious charm is still practised in Devonshire as a cure for the\r\ncomplaint called a white swelling or white leg. Bandages are used\r\nto tie round the afflicted limb, over which the following charm is\r\nrepeated nine times, and each time followed by the Lord’s Prayer:—\r\n\r\n“As Christ was walking, He saw the Virgin Mary sitting on a cold\r\nmarble stone. He said unto her, ‘If it is a white ill thing, or a red\r\nill thing, or a black ill thing, or a sticking, crackling, pricking,\r\nstabbing, bone ill thing, or a sore ill thing, or a swelling ill thing,\r\nor a rotten ill thing, or a cold creeping ill thing, or a smarting ill\r\nthing, let it fall from thee to the earth in My name, and the name of\r\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.’”\r\n\r\nThis comprehensive charm would seem to cover a multitude of ills indeed.\r\n\r\nThe following charms are taken from a MS. of the year 1475:—\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Charme to Staunch Blood._\r\n\r\n“Jesus, that was in Bethlehem born, and baptyzed was in the flumen\r\nJordane, as stente the water at hys comyng, so stente the blood of thys\r\nman N, thy serwaunt, throw the virtu of thy holy name + Jesu + and of\r\nthy Cosyn swete Sent Jon. And sey thys Charme fyve tymes with fyve\r\nPater nostirs, in the worshep of the fyve woundys.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_For Fever._\r\n\r\n“Wryt thys wordys on a lorell lef + Ysmael + Ysmael + adjuro vos per\r\nangelum ut soporetetur iste Homo N. and ley thys lef under hys head\r\nthat he wote not thereof, and let hym ete Letuse oft and drynk Ip’e\r\nseed small grounden in a morter, and temper yt with ale.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that the inhabitants of Colonsay had an ancient custom of\r\nfanning the face of the sick with the leaves of the Bible.\r\n\r\nMany and varied are the charms for curing warts. “For warts,” says\r\nSir Thomas Brown, “we rub our hands before the moon and commit any\r\nmaculated part to the touch of the dead.” Grose tells us to “steal a\r\npiece of beef from a butcher’s shop and rub your warts with it; then\r\nthrow it down the ‘necessary house,’ or bury it; and as the beef rots\r\nyour warts will decay”.\r\n\r\nThe leaf of the castor-oil plant worn round the neck was believed to\r\nward away devils, because the leaf is like an open hand.\r\n\r\nIn Bale’s _Interlude_ the following charms are given:—\r\n\r\n    “For the coughe take Judas Eare\r\n    With the parynge of a Peare,\r\n    And drynke them without feare\r\n        If ye will have remedy:\r\n    Thre syppes are for the hyckocke,\r\n    And six more for the chyckocke;\r\n    Thus my pretty pyckocke\r\n        Recover by and by.\r\n    If ye cannot slepe but slumber,\r\n    Geve Otes unto Saynt Uncumber,\r\n    And Beanes in a certen number\r\n        Unto Saynt Blase and Saynt Blythe.\r\n    Give Onyons to Saynt Cutlake\r\n    And Garlycke to Saynt Cyoyake,\r\n    If ye wyll spurne the heade ake.\r\n        Ye shall have them at Quene hyth.”\r\n\r\nAmulet rings were made from various metals, and worn to ward off\r\ndisease and misfortune.\r\n\r\nIn Berkshire there is a popular superstition that a ring made from a\r\npiece of silver collected at the communion is a cure for convulsions\r\nand fits.\r\n\r\nRings were also made from coffin-nails dug out of a grave, and\r\ncoffin-hinges, and used to cure cramp. Boorde, in his _Introduction to\r\nKnowledge_ (1542), says: “The kynges of Englande doth halowe every yere\r\nCrampe Rynges, ye which Rynges worne on one’s Fynger doth helpe them\r\nwhych hath the crampe”.\r\n\r\nOne of the favourite charms of the early Britons was the _anguineum_,\r\nor snake’s egg, which was supposed to be produced from the saliva of\r\nserpents, and besides its healing properties it got the credit of being\r\nable to float against the current.\r\n\r\nMany of the ancient writers believed that all charms were impotent\r\nwithout the repetition of certain words. Thus the following words\r\nare recommended by Barrett to be repeated as a charm against flux of\r\nblood:—\r\n\r\n    “In the blood of Adam arose death,\r\n    In the blood of Christ death is extinguished.\r\n    In the name of Christ I command thee, O blood,\r\n        That thou stop fluxing.”\r\n\r\nA piece of clean new vellum bearing the letters\r\n\r\n  יהרה\r\n\r\nwas considered a powerful amulet against ague.\r\n\r\nPliny makes several allusions to the poison of toads, and Juvenal tells\r\nus of the lady\r\n\r\n    “Who squeezed a toad into her husband’s wine”.\r\n\r\nThe life of James VI. of Scotland was once attempted by a woman named\r\nAgnes Sampson, who confessed on her trial, that in order to compass\r\nthe king’s death, she had hung up a black toad for nine days and\r\ncollected the juice that fell from it. The toadstone was greatly valued\r\nas an amulet against a great variety of diseases. It was often set in\r\nvaluable rings, which were handed down from generation to generation.\r\nSome are said to have borne a figure resembling a toad on their\r\nsurface. They varied in colour, some being dark-grey, and others of a\r\nbrownish fawn colour. These stones were supposed to grow only in very\r\nold toads, and to be extracted when they were dying. In reality, they\r\nwere manufactured of fused borax and many other materials.\r\n\r\nThe toadstone was supposed to be specially powerful against witchcraft\r\nand poison. When placed in proximity to the latter, or applied to\r\none bewitched, the stone was believed to sweat or change colour. It\r\nwas sometimes given internally as a remedy for fever or the bites of\r\nreptiles. The toad itself was also credited with medicinal virtues,\r\nand was given in plague and small-pox. Aubrey gives a process for\r\npreparing the toad for internal use, in which “twenty great fatt toads\r\nare directed to be stewed slowly, while alive, in a pipkin on the fire.\r\nThe calcined remains are again heated, and then finely powdered.” Sir\r\nKenhelm Digby speaks of their virtues, and recommends toads for quinsy,\r\nbleeding at the nose, and, above all, a most valuable remedy in king’s\r\nevil and scrofula. Within the last fifty years “toad doctors” visited\r\nmost country fairs, often selling bags containing the legs torn from\r\nthe body of a living toad for six or seven shillings each.\r\n\r\nAmong other curious charms used by the Romans to prolong life,\r\nespecially among the aged, was the singular practice of being breathed\r\nupon by young girls. This custom is frequently mentioned by ancient\r\nwriters, and was believed to be efficacious also in prolonging life\r\nin certain diseases. A reference to this singular charm is recorded\r\nby Kohansen in an inscription which was discovered at Rome, cut in a\r\nmarble tablet, and which ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n                “TO ÆSCULAPIUS AND HEALTH,\r\n                    this is erected by\r\n                   L. CLODIUS HERMIPPUS,\r\n  who by the breath of young girls lived 115 years and 5\r\n                           days\r\n       at which physicians were no little surprised.\r\n                          ------\r\n         Successive generations lead such a life.”\r\n                          ------\r\n\r\nIn later times amulets in civilised countries merged into the wearing\r\nof images of saints, or consecrated objects, and the use of scapularies\r\nby Roman Catholics at the present time. There is little doubt that\r\nthe custom of wearing precious stones in rings, and the charms worn\r\nas pendants to watch chains, originated in the amulet and talisman.\r\nWho can say that the belief in such charms has even yet died out? How\r\nmany people are there at the present day who do not carry about them\r\nsome coin, token, or object, to which they would probably be ashamed\r\nto confess, they attach some mysterious virtue? The belief in keeping\r\na crooked sixpence or a broken ring is evidence of that peculiar vein\r\nof superstition that runs through most of us, which, strange though\r\nit may seem, the advance of science and education has not altogether\r\ndispelled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMONK PHYSICIANS—ITINERANT DOCTORS—SURGERY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe treatment prescribed by the monks, who were ready to cure the\r\nbody as well as the soul, consisted mainly of holy water, prayer, the\r\ntouching of relics, and a number of decoctions of herbs, the properties\r\nof which they were acquainted with. Many of these physician monks\r\nwandered about the country devoting themselves to the wants of the sick.\r\n\r\nDuring the eleventh century hospitals began to spring up in various\r\nparts of the country and over Europe. They seem to have originated\r\nat the time of the crusades. Lacroix says: “The Johannists, and\r\nthe brotherhoods of St. Mary and St. Lazarus devoted themselves to\r\nmissions of charity in the East; in France, there were the brothers\r\nof St. Antony and of the Holy Ghost; and throughout the world the\r\nheroic chevaliers of St. John of Jerusalem or of the Templars, whose\r\ncountless establishments combined the triple character of conventual\r\nchurch, almshouse, and fortress, and who, attired in a dress both\r\nmilitary and monastic, wore a mantle similar to that seen in the\r\nstatues of Æsculapius, as a sign of the double mission—beneficent and\r\nwarlike—which they had sworn to fulfil”.\r\n\r\nEach of these orders had a special form of treatment, and took charge\r\nof specific diseases. Thus, the Templars paid special attention to\r\nthose pilgrim soldiers and travellers particularly troubled with\r\nophthalmia, scurvy, or those suffering from wounds. The Johannists\r\nprofessed the cure of epidemical disease and pestilence. The order\r\nof St. Antony looked after those stricken with dysenteries and those\r\ncomplaints known as St. Anthony’s fire, while the Lazarists treated\r\nleprosy, small-pox, and pustular fevers. The first school of nurses\r\nof which we have record, is one organised by Hildegarde, Abbess of\r\nRupertsberg, who died 1180. These nuns gave great assistance in\r\nthe hospitals. Thus the monks about the twelfth century tended the\r\nbodies as well as the souls, and even accompanied armies on military\r\nexpeditions in that capacity.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century faculties were established at Montpellier,\r\nSalerno, and Paris, by the order of papal bulls, to grant degrees\r\nin medicine. In order to obtain the title of master physician, the\r\ncandidate had first to become a clerk, then pass an examination before\r\nmasters or doctors selected from the staff of the college by the Bishop\r\nof Maguelonne.\r\n\r\nThe barbers at this time came to occupy an important position in\r\nmedicine, and were promoted to the rank of subordinate surgeons,\r\nchiefly for blood-letting and minor accidents.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century medicine had rapidly progressed in Europe,\r\nand the celebrated physician and surgeon Lanfranc founded the St.\r\nCosmo College at Paris, the examinations of which all surgeons were\r\nobliged to pass. A decree was also passed by the King of France in 1352\r\nprohibiting any one who was not an apothecary, student, or mendicant\r\nmonk from practising medicine. The king, we find, also exempted\r\nthe master barbers from doing duty as watchmen, as “the barbers\r\nbeing nearly all of them in the habit of practising surgery, great\r\ninconvenience might arise if they were absent from their houses when\r\nsent for during the night”.\r\n\r\nIn France, the little barbers, as they were called, travelled about\r\non foot from village to village with a bag containing their drugs\r\nand remedies, while the great barbers, or sworn surgeons, astride\r\ntheir hacks with tinkling bells to announce their approach, wore long\r\nrobes trimmed with fur, and other rich apparel. They were usually\r\naccompanied by an assistant and several servants, who carried their\r\ncases of instruments, which always included scissors, nippers, a probe\r\nor _éprouvette_, razors, lances, and needles. He also carried five\r\nkinds of ointments, _viz._, basilicon, apostles’ ointment, the white\r\nointment, yellow ointment, and the dialtœa ointment for subduing\r\nlocal pain.\r\n\r\nGuy de Chauliac, who was physician to three successive popes, stated\r\n“he never went out on his visits without taking several clysters and\r\nplain remedies, besides gathering herbs in the field, so as to treat\r\ndiseases in a proper manner”.\r\n\r\nEven at that early time the credulity of the public became imposed upon\r\nby quacks, and Lacroix tells us of an English surgeon, one Goddesden,\r\nwho had two sorts of prescriptions, one for the rich and another for\r\nthe poor; he sold at a high price to the barbers a so-called panacea,\r\nwhich the latter sold at a large profit, and this was simply a mixture\r\nof frogs pounded in a mortar. In one of his books there is a short\r\nchapter on _disagreeable_ diseases, as he terms them, “which work their\r\nown cure, and bring no grist to the doctor’s mill”.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century the practice of medicine became more and\r\nmore influenced and dominated by the occult sciences, and especially\r\nastrology. All mankind was ruled by the stars, and the cause of\r\nvarious diseases was attributed to the conjunction of certain planets.\r\n“They believed the blood rose during the daytime towards the sun, and\r\ndescended into the lower extremities at night; that at the third hour\r\nthe bile subsided, so that its acid properties might not be mixed with\r\nthe course of the blood; and that at the second hour the atrabilis,\r\nand in the evening the phlegm, subsided.” Such illusions and erroneous\r\nbeliefs stopped the progress of science, and threatened to turn a\r\nnoble art into mere charlatanry. In this country the surgeons mostly\r\npractised as apothecaries; and we are told that when Henry V. invaded\r\nFrance in 1415, the only surgeon he had in his camp was one Thomas\r\nMorstede, who was with difficulty induced to accompany the army,\r\nbringing with him twelve assistants.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth century saw an effort to throw off some of these errors\r\nwhich had grown round the art. The invention of printing helped largely\r\nin disseminating knowledge throughout Europe, and the followers of\r\nmedicine assumed a higher position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN APOTHECARY’S SHOP. FIFTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the fifteenth century Tachenius wrote: “There\r\nis no new thing under the sun whatsoever, therefore the followers\r\nof Hippocrates have handed out, and as it were midwifed into the\r\nworld, the same was from the beginning though our eyes were not so\r\nclear-sighted as to discern it”. To which Stephen Pasquier replied in\r\nthe following rhyme:—\r\n\r\n    “Some Paracelse of novelty implead,\r\n    For which, judged crime, he erst was banished,\r\n    So Hippocrates, Chrysippus, and at Rome\r\n    Asclepiade, too, were new. They’d all one doom.\r\n    They who condemn new things condemn the old,\r\n    Or else do both misjudge and are o’er bold.”\r\n\r\nDuring the crusades the surgeons naturally acquired a very large\r\nexperience in the treatment of wounds—incised, lacerated, and\r\ncontused. Baldwin was severely wounded before Jerusalem, having\r\nreceived a spear-thrust “through the thigh and the loins”. He fell\r\nfainting from his horse, but the most skilful leeches were summoned,\r\n“by whose art and skill the king and valiant athlete was enabled to\r\nrecover from this deadly wound”. Baldwin was also wounded in the foot\r\nbefore Antioch, and the surgical talent available was baffled by the\r\ninjury to such a degree that it was proposed to kill a Saracen after\r\nwounding him in the same part, so as to learn the proper course to\r\npursue. Baldwin, however, refused to allow this crude attempt at\r\nexperimental surgery to be made. There seem to be no medical records of\r\nthe second crusade. In the third, the French king, Philippe Auguste,\r\nand our own Cœur de Lion suffered grievously from a disease, the\r\nsymptomatology of which included extensive exfoliation of the skin,\r\nshedding of the nails, and loss of the hair. The disease is called\r\n_Arnoldia_ by the chroniclers, and is variously conjectured to have\r\nbeen leprosy or syphilis. It could hardly have been leprosy, for both\r\nthe royal sufferers recovered, Cœur de Lion being killed eight years\r\nlater at the siege of Chalus, and Philippe Auguste dying of quartan\r\nague twenty-four years after Richard. Of the fourth crusade we have no\r\nmedical details. In the fifth, St. Louis of France was accompanied by\r\nhis private physician Dudon and other leeches; among them was a lady\r\ndoctor or _phisicienne_ named Hernandis, who probably attended the\r\nqueen in her confinement, which took place at Damietta. The expedition\r\nsuffered terribly from scurvy, typhus, and other pestilences. The\r\npart played by water in the diffusion of disease would seem to have\r\nbeen recognised, though the methods of water examination would hardly\r\nsatisfy a modern chemist. A piece of white linen was dipped in the\r\nwater to be tested, and then dried; if there were any stains on the\r\nlinen the water was condemned, but if not it was pronounced pure.\r\nThe addition of four crushed almonds or beans was believed to make\r\nthe water of the Nile safe for drinking. The method of disinfection\r\nadopted for the king’s tent was to fumigate it with a mixture of amber,\r\nchick peas, or lupine, which were macerated in wine, and then placed\r\non live charcoal. In the sixth crusade, which took place twenty-two\r\nyears later, vast numbers, including St. Louis himself, fell victims to\r\nignorance of the elements of sanitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPLANT LORE, DRUG CHARMS, AND FOLK MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious survival of the age of superstition and romance attaches to\r\nthe red resin known as dragon’s blood, and is still largely practised\r\nby a certain class of uneducated women in many parts of the country.\r\nThe resin is the product of the _Pterocarpus Indicus_ growing in the\r\nEast Indies, and now chiefly used as a colouring agent in varnishes and\r\nstains, etc. It was formerly employed in medicine for its astringent\r\nproperties, but has now entirely gone out of use for that purpose.[4]\r\n\r\n        [4] The Egyptian magical texts show that hair, feathers, the\r\n        serpent’s skin, and “_the blood of the mystic eye_,” were used\r\n        as charms of protecting or destroying power. This very probably\r\n        denotes what is known as the charm of dragon’s blood, which is\r\n        still employed as a potent love charm or philtre, the blood\r\n        being now typified by the red resin of this name.\r\n\r\nThe secret of its use as a charm is shrouded in some mystery, and\r\nthose who use it are very reticent in giving particulars; but it has\r\nbeen gathered, that several charms of a romantic nature are worked\r\nwith this otherwise very commonplace article of commerce. The most\r\ncommon of these seems to be practised by young girls who are jealous of\r\ntheir lovers and seek to win back their affection. A small quantity of\r\ndragon’s blood is procured, wrapped in paper, and thrown on the fire\r\nwhilst the following couplet or incantation is repeated:—\r\n\r\n    “May he no pleasure or profit see,\r\n    Till he comes back again to me”.\r\n\r\nAnother method much believed in by women of a certain class, and\r\nused by them to attract the opposite sex, is to mix dragon’s blood,\r\nquicksilver, saltpetre, and sulphur, and throw them on the fire,\r\nrepeating a similar incantation.\r\n\r\nA chemist in the north of England, giving his experience on the sale\r\nof dragon’s blood, says: “I have had great difficulty in finding out\r\nfor what purpose it was used. It was not for medicine, but for a kind\r\nof witchcraft. The women burn it upon a bright fire, while wishing\r\nfor their affection to be returned by some one of the opposite sex;\r\nalso those who have quarrelled with their husbands and desire to be\r\nfriends again; girls who have fallen out with their young men, and\r\nwant to win them back; as well as young women wanting sweethearts. A\r\nworking man recently came to me for a small quantity, and I inquired\r\nfor what purpose it was required. He was very reluctant to mention\r\nanything about it, but at length said, a man had made him lose three\r\nsovereigns, and he wished, as he had been swindled out of the money, to\r\nhave his revenge, and make him suffer for it. He was going to turn the\r\ndragon’s blood on a clear fire, and he believed that the ill wishes of\r\nthe person thus burning it would have a dire effect on the individual\r\nthought of.”\r\n\r\nAnother charm said to be worked with this drug, in which an inverted\r\nteacup plays a prominent part, has reference to the sex of expected\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nAltogether, considerable romantic properties seem to be associated with\r\nthis resin, but there seems to be no authentic record of the same,\r\nthe only probable explanation being, that it was used and sold, like\r\nother innocent articles, by those who were supposed to have dealings\r\nin the black art, for working charms, which have thus been handed\r\ndown from mediæval times. Coles states: “The early Greeks called\r\ndragon’s blood _Cinnabaris_, not knowing whether it was of vegetable\r\nor mineral origin; and that Pliny, Solinus, and Monardus have set it\r\ndown for truth that it was the blood of a dragon or serpent, crushed\r\nto death by the weight of the dying elephant falling upon him; but he\r\nthinks it was certainly so called from the bloody colour that it is\r\nof, being nothing else but a mere gum”. It was used medicinally as an\r\nemmenagogue, and in the arts 300 years ago by goldsmiths and painters\r\nin glass, by the former as a base for enamel to set a foil under\r\nprecious stones to give them greater lustre, and the latter by fire, to\r\nstrike a crimson colour into glass for stained windows.\r\n\r\nThat a belief in charms and witchcraft is still fostered by ignorant\r\npeople in some parts of the country, is manifest from cases reported\r\nin the newspapers from time to time. Two practitioners of the occult\r\nsciences were haled before the magistrates but recently. One, an old\r\ncrone, who confessed to using dragon’s blood in working her love\r\ncharms, was rewarded with seven days with hard labour.\r\n\r\nThe other, which came to light in Cornwall, was a middle-aged\r\nindividual who practised as a wizard. His treatment consisted of\r\nwriting an amulet to be worn near the body. Money was then required to\r\nremove the spell from the bewitched patient to some one else. To this\r\nvictim was to be lent neither “cock, pin, or pan,” and by the aid of\r\nthe planets the patient would be cured. But these are hard times truly\r\nfor the wizard and magician, and this professor was rewarded with\r\nseven months’ incarceration in one of her Majesty’s gaols.\r\n\r\nSingular superstitious properties are attributed to certain plants. The\r\nwalnut was formerly employed in medicine as an application to wounds\r\nand an antidote to poisons; and the following old riddle, says William\r\nColes in 1657, “almost every one knows”:—\r\n\r\n    “As high as a house,\r\n    As little as a mouse,\r\n    As round as a ball,\r\n    As bitter as gall,\r\n    As white as milk,\r\n    As soft as silk”.\r\n\r\nThere is an old tradition that the more the branches are beaten, the\r\nmore prolific the fruit will be. There is a fable in Æsop of a woman\r\nwho asked the walnut tree growing by the wayside, which was pelted at\r\nwith stones and sticks by them that passed by, why it was so foolish\r\nas to bring forth fruit seeing that it was so beaten for its pains, to\r\nwhich the tree rehearsed these two proverbial verses:—\r\n\r\n    “Nux, Asinus, Mulier, Simili suret lege legati,\r\n    Haes tria nil recte faciunt si verbera cessent”.\r\n\r\n“The English whereof,” the chronicler quaintly continues, “I could\r\ntell you, but that I fear the women of this preposterous age would\r\nbe angry.” True it is that this tree, the more it is beaten the more\r\nnuts it bears. The walnut was one of the chief ingredients in the\r\ncelebrated antidote against poison which was attributed to the wise\r\nking Mithridates. The formula ran as follows: “Two (wall) nuttes and\r\ntwo figges and twenty rewe beans, stamped together with a little suet\r\nand eaten fasting, doth defende a man from poison and pestilence that\r\nday”.[5]\r\n\r\n        [5] Bullen’s _Governmente of Health_. 1558.\r\n\r\nSage was much esteemed by the housewife for simple ailments, and its\r\nproperties are embodied in the following lines, which are of great\r\nantiquity:—\r\n\r\n    “Sage helpes the nerves, and by its powerfull might\r\n    Palsies and Feavers, sharp it puts to flight”.[6]\r\n\r\nAn old writer says, “Be sure you wash your sage for fear the Toades,\r\nwho as I conceive come to it to discharge their poyson, should leave\r\nsome of their venom upon the Leaves”.\r\n\r\n        [6] William Coles, _Adam in Eden_. 1657.\r\n\r\nOf rue, which was largely used as a carminative, the following couplet\r\nhas been handed down:—\r\n\r\n    “Rue maketh chast, and eke preserveth sight,\r\n    Infuseth wit, and Fleas doth put to flight”.\r\n\r\nTradition says that a weasel, going to fight with a serpent, eateth\r\nrue, and rubbeth herself therewith to avoid his poison. Crollius\r\nstates: “The sign of the cross upon the seed of the rue, drives away\r\nall phantoms and evil spirits by signature”.\r\n\r\nHenbane, the Latins called Apollinaris, either from Apollo, the\r\ninventor of physic, or because it makes men mad like unto Apollo’s\r\ncreatures when they deliver his oracles. “It was called in English\r\nhenbane, because the seeds are hurtful to hens,” says William Coles.\r\n“The fumes of the dryed herb when burnt, will make Hens fall from their\r\nroosting place as though they were dead.”\r\n\r\nOf the moonwort, a simple used to allay bleeding and applied to\r\nfractures, an old tradition says that it can be used to open locks,\r\nfetters, and shoes from those horses feet that go on the places where\r\nit groweth, and of this opinion was Culpepper, who, though he railed\r\nagainst superstition in others, tells a story of a troop of horse of\r\nthe Earl of Essex, which being drawn up in a body, many of them lost\r\ntheir shoes upon White Downe in Devonshire, near Tiverton, because\r\nmoonwort grows upon the heaths.\r\n\r\nThe root of the _Polygonatum angulosum_, commonly called Solomon’s\r\nSeal, has a popular reputation for removing the congealed blood from\r\na bruise after a blow or fall, for which property it appears to have\r\nbeen used 800 years ago. Coles states: “The bruised roots soddereth\r\nand gleweth together broken bones very speedily and strangely, the\r\nroots being stamped and outwardly applied as a pultis. The same also\r\nis available for outward bruises, falls, or blowes, both to dispel the\r\ncongealed blood and to take away the paines, and the black and blew\r\nmarkes that abide after the hurt.” The origin of the name Solomon’s\r\nSeal is doubtless due to the dark marks seen on cutting the root\r\ntransversely, which somewhat resemble an ancient seal engraved with\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nOf Solomon’s Seal, Dioscorides says that “the root pounded and laid on\r\nfresh wounds heals and seals them up”; and it is on this account that\r\nGerard considers its name to have originated.\r\n\r\nAn old author quaintly remarks with respect to its properties: “The\r\nroots of Solomon’s Seale stamped while it is fresh and greene and\r\napplied, taketh away in one night, or two at the most, any bruse,\r\nblacke or blew spots gotten by fals, or woman’s wilfulness in stumbling\r\nupon their hastie husband’s fists or such like”.\r\n\r\nThe anemone was regarded by the ancients as an emblem of sickness,\r\nand Pliny tells us that the physicians and wise men ordered every\r\nperson to gather the first anemone he saw in the year, repeating at\r\nthe same time, “I gather thee for a remedy against disease”. It was\r\nthen devoutly placed in scarlet cloth and kept undisturbed unless the\r\ngatherer became unwell, when it was tied either around the neck or the\r\narm of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe trefoil, vervain, St. John’s wort, and dill were supposed to\r\npossess the power of protecting the wearer from the evil eye or\r\nwitchcraft, hence the old rhyme called Saint Colme’s charm:—\r\n\r\n    “Trefoil, vervain, John’s wort, dill,\r\n    Hinders witches of their will;\r\n    Well is them, that well may\r\n    Fast upon St. Andrew’s Day.\r\n\r\n    Saint Bride and her brat,\r\n    Saint Colme and his cat,\r\n    Saint Michael and his spear,\r\n    Keep the home frae reif and wear.”\r\n\r\nThere is an old tradition that the white veins of the variety of\r\nthistle known as the _Carduus Marianus_ was caused originally by a drop\r\nof the milk of the Virgin Mary having fallen thereon, and for this\r\ncause the plant was in early times much revered.\r\n\r\nThe house leek, with its pretty rose-coloured flowers, often seen\r\ngrowing along the tops of walls and on the roofs of cottages in\r\ncountry places, was formerly known by the imposing name of the thunder\r\nplant, from the power it was supposed to possess of averting lightning\r\nfrom the house or building on which it was planted. Hence the custom of\r\nplanting it on the roof.\r\n\r\nSt. John’s wort was a noted herb in magical arts, and was also esteemed\r\nas a repellant of spectres and to drive away demons, and was called\r\n_Fuga Dæmonum_ by the old botanists. French and German peasants still\r\ngather the plant with great ceremony on St. John’s Day.\r\n\r\nThat charming little wild flower the scarlet pimpernell, which grows in\r\nour fields and hedges, ranked among the simples of ancient times. It\r\nwas used as a remedy against the plague, and an antidote against the\r\nbites and stings of venomous insects, and to stop bleeding. This latter\r\nattribute was doubtless more mythical than correct, being founded on\r\nwhat the ancients called having the signature, which meant that if\r\na substance was of blood colour it signified it would stop bleeding\r\nbecause of the same. Hung over the door or porch of a house, it was\r\nbelieved to defend the inmates from witchcraft.\r\n\r\nJosephus states in his _History of the Jews_[7] that Solomon\r\ndiscovered a plant efficacious in the cure of epilepsy, and that he\r\nemployed the aid of a charm or spell for the purpose of assisting\r\nits virtues. The root of the herb was concealed in a ring, which was\r\napplied to the nostrils of the demoniac; and Josephus himself declares\r\nthat he saw a Jewish priest practice the art of Solomon, with complete\r\nsuccess, in the presence of Vespasian, his sons, and the tribune of the\r\nRoman army.\r\n\r\n        [7] Lib. viii., c. ii., 5.\r\n\r\nFrom this art, exhibited through the medium of a ring or seal, we have\r\nthe Eastern stories which celebrate the seal of Solomon and record its\r\nwonderful sway over the various orders of genii, who were supposed to\r\nbe the invisible tormentors or benefactors of the human race.\r\n\r\n“Vervain,” says Coles, “was reported to be effectual against all\r\npoisons and the venom of dangerous beasts and serpents, and also\r\nagainst bewitched drinks and the like, so that it is not only used in,\r\nbut against witchcraft. That this herb is used by witches may appear\r\nfrom the story of Anne Bodenham, the witch of Salisbury, who sent her\r\nruffian-like spirits to gather vervain and dill, which was to be given\r\nto one whom she desired to bewitch.”\r\n\r\nThe magi of the ancient Elamites or Persians made use of vervain in\r\ntheir worship or adoration of the sun, always carrying branches of it\r\nin their hands when they approached the altar.\r\n\r\nThey also believed that by smearing the body over with the juice of\r\nthis plant, the individual could have whatever he wished, be able to\r\nreconcile his most inveterate enemies, cure diseases, and perform other\r\nmagical operations. They always gathered the plant when neither sun nor\r\nmoon was visible, and poured honey and honeycomb on the earth as an\r\natonement for robbing it of this precious herb.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks called it the Sacred Herb, and used it to cleanse the\r\nfestival table of Jupiter before any great ceremony took place.\r\n\r\nThe Romans also employed it in the performance of their religious\r\nrites, for cleansing their altars, and sprinkling holy water.\r\n\r\nIt was hung in their dwellings to ward off evil spirits.\r\n\r\nVervain was also one of the sacred plants of the Druids, both in Gaul\r\nand Britain. They cut it with much ceremony in the spring of the year,\r\nand made offerings to the earth for so doing. They also used it to\r\nanoint the body to cure disease.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans dedicated it to the god of war, and in\r\nScandinavia it was deemed sacred to Thor. The eye anointed with an\r\nointment of vervain was supposed to possess second sight. Its influence\r\nover Venus has doubtless to do with its use as a love token. It is said\r\nthat the custom is still practised in Germany of presenting a bride\r\nwith a wreath of vervain.\r\n\r\nOther magic wreaths worn by lovers when they wished to see their fate,\r\nwere composed of rue, crane’s bill, and willow.\r\n\r\nThe hawkweed commonly seen in our fields was regarded by the Greeks\r\nas the emblem of quick-sightedness, believing that the hawk, a bird\r\nrenowned for its bright eye and quick sight, sharpened its visual\r\norgans with the juice of this plant. Thus it became famed in early\r\nmedical practice as a remedy for dimness of sight, and was employed to\r\nfeed the hawks used in the old art of falconry.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, a twig of the rowan tree or mountain ash is often sewed up\r\nin the cow’s tail, to protect the animal from witches and warlocks.\r\n\r\nThe squill was used by the Egyptians for dropsy, under the mystic name\r\nof the “Eye of Typhon”.\r\n\r\nAn old name for the fruit of the mandrake was “love apples”. They were\r\nfrequently used in ancient times in philtres and love potions. This\r\nplant belongs to the natural order _Solanaceæ_, which also includes\r\nthe potato and the tobacco plant. Its leaves spring directly from\r\nthe root similarly to those of the lettuce, before it shoots into\r\nflower, and its purple-coloured blossoms are succeeded by a yellow\r\nberry or “apple,” which still ripens in Palestine at the time of the\r\nwheat harvest. An overdose of the fruit is said to produce a sort\r\nof temporary insanity. From the earliest times it has been credited\r\nwith magical virtues, and supposed to confer superhuman powers on its\r\npossessor. The most valued specimens were those which grew under a\r\ngibbet where a malefactor hung in chains. It was believed that on being\r\ntorn from the earth the mandrake uttered a groan, and that whosoever\r\nheard it, dropped dead on the spot. The approved method of gathering\r\nit was to fasten the plant to a dog’s tail, and beat the animal till\r\nhis struggles pulled the root up. The dog heard the groan and died, but\r\nthose who directed the proceedings escaped by having their ears stopped\r\nwith pitch or wax.\r\n\r\nIt was customary in Germany in mediæval times to form or carve small\r\nfigures out of the mandrake root, which were called _abrunes_. “These\r\nimages,” says Phillips, “they dressed regularly every day, consulted as\r\noracles, and their repute was such that they were manufactured in great\r\nnumbers and sold in cases.”\r\n\r\nThey appear to have been brought over to England in the time of\r\nHenry VIII., and met with ready purchasers, it being pretended that\r\nthey would, with the assistance of certain mystic words, be able to\r\nincrease whatever money was placed near them. These roots were said to\r\nhave been taken from plants which had grown underneath gibbets, and had\r\nbeen influenced by the flesh of the criminals hung thereon.\r\n\r\nIt is singular how the willow has ever been associated with sorrow\r\nand sadness, even from the time the daughters of Israel hung their\r\nharps on its branches. Among heathen nations the tree was regarded as\r\nan evil omen, and was used as torches at funerals. “The early poets,”\r\nsays Johns, “made the willow of despairing woe,” and Shakespeare\r\nfrequently alludes to it as being used to weave garlands for jilted and\r\nsorrow-stricken lovers. Benedick says:—\r\n\r\n  “I offered him my company to a willow tree, either to make him a\r\n  garland, as being forsaken, or to bind him up a rod as being worthy\r\n  to be whipped”.\r\n\r\nAnd Bona, in _Henry VI._, remarks:—\r\n\r\n    “Tell him, in hope he’ll prove a widower shortly,\r\n    I’ll wear the willow garland for his sake”.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been customary to wear it twined round the head as a\r\nsymbol of sorrow and mourning, but the origin of the custom is unknown.\r\n\r\nA peculiar virtue was supposed to be attached to the eating of almonds,\r\nwhich is still believed in some parts of the country, _viz._, that it\r\nprotects the eater from drunkenness.\r\n\r\nGerard says, “Five or six being taken fasting keepe a man from being\r\ndrunke”.\r\n\r\nThe pretty flower called the bachelor’s button, which is common in\r\nour hedgerows, is said to possess the following peculiar property of\r\ndivination. “When carried in the pocket by men, and under the apron by\r\nwomen, it will retain or lose its freshness according to the good or\r\nbad success of the wearer’s amatory prospects.”\r\n\r\nA considerable amount of romantic lore lingers about the bean and nut.\r\nThe bean was regarded with veneration by both the Greeks and Romans,\r\nand on account of its sacred associations became the instrument for\r\nvoting by ballot in early times. Nuts of various kinds have long been\r\nassociated with certain love charms, and some of these old customs,\r\nsuch as the cracking of nuts, still survive and are practised on All\r\nHallow Eve. An old charm for nut-testing runs as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “Two hazel nuts I threw into the flame,\r\n    And to each nut I gave a sweetheart’s name;\r\n    _This_ with the loudest bounce me sore amazed,\r\n    _That_ in a flame of brightest colour blazed;\r\n    As blazed the nut, so may thy passion glow,\r\n    For ’twas _thy_ nut that did so brightly glow”.\r\n\r\nThere is an old tradition that the white hawthorn was used to plait the\r\nsacred crown of thorns, and that from that time the tree was endowed\r\nwith special virtues.\r\n\r\nAn old writer says: “He that beareth a branch on hym thereof, no\r\nthundre, ne, no maner of tempest may dere hym; ne, in the howse that it\r\nis ynne may none evil ghost enter”.\r\n\r\nA great amount of superstition was associated with various ferns in\r\nmediæval times, and fern seed was supposed to possess the wonderful\r\nproperty of rendering those who swallowed it invisible.\r\n\r\nAccording to the doctrine of Signatures, various shaped leaves were\r\nused for special diseases. A liver-shaped leaf was used to cure\r\ncomplaints of that organ, and a heart-shaped leaf was used for diseases\r\nof the heart, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe black hellebore was employed by the ancients to purify their\r\ndwellings, and they believed that its presence in their rooms drove\r\naway evil spirits. It was also customary to bless the cattle with\r\nhellebore to keep them free from spells wrought by the wicked.\r\n\r\nWhen dug up for these purposes, certain religious ceremonies were\r\nobserved. First a circle was drawn round the plant with a sword, and\r\nthen, turning to the east, a humble prayer was made by the devotee\r\nto Apollo and Æsculapius, for permission to dig up the root. If an\r\neagle approached the spot during the performance of the rites, it was\r\nsupposed to predict the certain death of the person who took up the\r\nplant in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nIt is related by Dioscorides that Carneades, the Cyrenaic philosopher\r\nwho undertook to answer the books of Zeno, sharpened his wit and\r\nquickened his spirit by purging his head with powdered hellebore.\r\n\r\nThe peony owes its name to Pæon, a famous physician of ancient Greece,\r\nwho is said to have cured, by the aid of this plant, the wounds which\r\nthe Greeks received during the Trojan war. It was largely used as an\r\namulet, and demons were supposed to fly from the spot where it was\r\nplanted. A small piece was worn round the neck to protect the wearer\r\nfrom enchantment.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious tradition connected with that charming little\r\nflower the forget-me-not. It is, that the juice, or decoction of the\r\nplant, has the peculiar property of hardening steel, and that if edged\r\ntools of that metal be made red hot and then quenched in the juice or\r\ndecoction, and this be repeated several times, the steel will become\r\nso hard as to cut iron without turning the edge.\r\n\r\nThe elder had a great reputation as an amulet. An old writer states,\r\n“if one ride with two little sticks of elder in his pockets he shall\r\nnot fret nor pant let the horse go never so hard”.\r\n\r\nAccording to the _Anatomie of the Elder_ (1655), “The common people\r\nkeep as a great secret in curing wounds the leaves of the elder, which\r\nthey have gathered the last day of April, which, to disappoint the\r\ncharms of witches, they had applied to their doors and windows”.\r\n\r\nA piece cut out between two knots was worn as an amulet against\r\nerysipelas.\r\n\r\nLupton says: “Make powder of the flowers of elder gathered on Midsummer\r\nDay, being before well dryed, and use a spoonful thereof in a good\r\ndraught of Borage water, morning and evening, first and last, for the\r\nspace of a month, and it will make you seem young a great while”.\r\n\r\nThe elder is still believed in the south of Germany to drive away evil\r\nspirits, and in Denmark and Norway it is held in the same veneration.\r\nIt is customary in the Tyrol to plant an elder bush in the form of a\r\ncross on a new grave, and if it blossoms, the soul of the body interred\r\nbeneath is supposed to be in Paradise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMUMMIES AND THEIR USE IN MEDICINE—THE UNICORN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho first introduced mummies as medicinal agents is not known, but\r\nthere is something particularly weird and gruesome in the idea of\r\nthe ancient physician dosing a sick patient, with the remains of a\r\npredeceased fellowman, in order to restore him to health. The art of\r\nembalming was practised thousands of years before the Christian era,\r\nand was regarded as the greatest token of esteem that could be paid by\r\nthe living to the dead. Pomet says there were two kinds of embalming\r\npractised by the ancient Egyptians. The first and most costly was used\r\nto none but persons of the highest class, and was valued at a talent\r\nof silver, or about £500. Three people were employed in the operation;\r\none was a kind of designer or overseer, who marked out such parts of\r\nthe body as were to be opened. The next was a dissector, who with a\r\nknife of Ethiopian stone cut the flesh as much as necessary, and as\r\nthe law would permit, and immediately afterwards fled away with all\r\nthe expedition possible, because it was the custom of the relatives\r\nand domestics to pursue the dissector with stones and do him all the\r\ninjuries they could, treating him as an impious wretch and the worst of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAfter this operation the embalmers, who were accounted holy men,\r\nentered to perform their offices, which consisted in removing the\r\ninternal organs, cleansing with palm wine and other aromatical liquor,\r\nand during the space of thirty days they filled the cavity with\r\npowdered myrrh, aloes, Indian spikenard, bitumen, and other aromatics.\r\nIn the process of embalming used by the middle class, which cost about\r\n£250, the body was syringed with a decoction of herbs and oil of cedar,\r\nthen put into salt for seventy days, after which it was enveloped in\r\nbandages of fine linen, which had been dipped in myrrh and asphaltum,\r\nand the designer, who was called the scribe, covered the wrapping with\r\na painted cloth, on which were represented the rites of their religion\r\nin hieroglyphics, and the animals which the dead loved most. There was\r\na third process of embalming used by the poorer people, in which a\r\nmixture of pitch and bitumen was used. The bodies were first dried with\r\nlime, and then coated with a mixture of nitre, salt, honey, and wax to\r\nprotect them from the air. Mummies of deceased persons were held in the\r\ngreatest reverence by their relatives. The faces were sometimes gilded\r\nand painted and adorned with head-cloths, they were then placed in\r\nelaborate cases according to the position and rank of the person, and\r\ndeposited in the highest part of their houses. An old writer states:\r\n“They reckoned their deceased as such a valuable token and pledge of\r\ntheir faith, that if any of them happened to want money he could not\r\ngive a better security than the embalmed body of his relation; and\r\nthat which made it esteemed so was, that they would spare no pains to\r\npay the money again; for if by mischance the debtor could not redeem\r\nthis pledge, he was reckoned unworthy of civil society, which engaged\r\nhim indispensably to find out ways to recover his kinsman in the time\r\nlimited, otherwise he was blamed by all the world”.\r\n\r\nSome 300 years ago a large trade was carried on, mostly by Jews, who\r\nimported mummies for medicinal purposes, as they were much used by\r\nthe ancient physicians; but there is little doubt that a great deal\r\nof fraud was practised by the mummy merchants, and that many were\r\nspecially manufactured for the purpose. Pomet, alluding to this in his\r\n_History of Druggs_, writes: “We may daily see the Jews carrying on\r\ntheir rogueries as to these mummies, and after them the Christians;\r\nfor the mummies that were brought from Alexandria, Egypt, Venice, and\r\nLyons are nothing else but the bodies of people that die several ways.\r\nThose from Africa called white mummies, are nothing else but bodies\r\nthat have been drowned at sea, which, being cast upon the African\r\ncoast, are buried and dried in the sands, which are very hot.” When\r\nthe ancient physician prescribed mummy for a bad headache, he rarely\r\ngot what he imagined. “For,” the writer continues: “I am not able to\r\nstop the abuses committed by those who use this commodity. I shall only\r\nadvise such as buy to choose what is of a fine shining black, not full\r\nof bones and dirt, of a good smell, and which being burnt does not\r\nstink of pitch. Such is reckoned proper for contusions, and to hinder\r\nblood from coagulating in the body. It is also given in epilepsies,\r\nvertigoes, and palsies. The dose is two drachms in powder, or the same\r\nmade into a bolus. It also stops mortifications, heals wounds, and is\r\nan ingredient in many compositions.” In a price list, dated 1685, mummy\r\nis quoted at 5s. 4d. per lb.\r\n\r\nOf the mummies used in medicine five kinds were known.\r\n\r\nFactitious.—Those in which bitumen and pitch were largely used in the\r\nprocess of embalming.\r\n\r\nThose bodies dried by the sun in the country of the Hammonians between\r\nCyrene and Alexandria, being mostly the bodies of passengers buried in\r\nthe quicksands.\r\n\r\nTrue Egyptian.\r\n\r\nThe Arabian, being those bodies embalmed with myrrh, aloes, and other\r\naromatic gums.\r\n\r\nArtificial mummies. Crollius in his _Royal Chemist_ gives the following\r\nprocess for preparing artificial mummy:—\r\n\r\n“Take the carcass of a young man (some say red haired), not dying of a\r\ndisease but killed, let it lie twenty-four hours in clear water in the\r\nair, cut the flesh in pieces, to which add powder of myrrh and a little\r\naloes, imbibe it twenty-four hours in spirit of wine and turpentine,\r\ntake it out and hang it up for twelve hours, then imbibe it again,\r\ntwenty-four hours in fresh spirit, then hang up the pieces in a dry air\r\nand a shady place.” A rather cheerful operation for the apothecary. It\r\nwould possibly account for many a mysterious disappearance in those\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nMummy entered into a large number of preparations which we come across\r\nin the old dispensatories. There was the balsam, which is described\r\nby an old writer as “having such a piercing quality that it pierceth\r\nall parts and restores wasted limbs, consumption, and cures all ulcers\r\nand corruptions”. Beside mummies, the apothecaries stocked human fat,\r\nrespecting which gruesome material Pomet says: “Everybody knows in\r\nParis the public executioner sells it, the druggists and apothecaries\r\na little; nevertheless, they vend a sort of it prepared with aromatic\r\nherbs, and which is without comparison much better than that which\r\ncomes from the hands of the hangman”. Human fat was much esteemed for\r\nrubbing, in cases of rheumatism and kindred complaints.\r\n\r\nAnother part of the body used in ancient medicine was the human skull;\r\nalso a growth called the moss from the human skull, probably of fungoid\r\norigin, that appeared on the bone on keeping. An old writer in the\r\nseventeenth century says: “You may see in the druggist shops of London\r\nsome skulls entirely covered with moss, and some that only have the\r\nmoss growing on some parts. They send these skulls especially to\r\nGermany, to put into the composition of the sympathetic ointment which\r\nCrollius describes in his _Royal Chemist_, and which is used for the\r\nfalling sickness.”\r\n\r\nSpecial virtue was attributed to skulls taken from gibbets. Referring\r\nto these, Pomet states: “The English druggists, especially those of\r\nLondon, sell skulls of the dead upon which there is a little greenish\r\nmoss called usnea, because of its near resemblance to the moss which\r\ngrows on the oak. These skulls mostly come from Ireland, where they\r\nfrequently let the bodies of criminals hang on the gibbet till they\r\nfall to pieces.” The human skulls were sold at 8s., 9s., 10s., and\r\n11s. each. They were given in the form of powder, or one of the\r\npreparations, such as the oil or tincture. Besides the skull, other\r\nhuman bones, calcined and powdered were used. An oil and a tincture of\r\nskulls, an extract of the gall and the heart of man made with rectified\r\nspirit, was dropped into the ear as a remedy for deafness, and also\r\ngiven internally for epilepsy. Human hair was used for jaundice,\r\nfinger-nails as an emetic (which one can hardly wonder at), and blood\r\ndrawn from a healthy man, drunk hot, was used to prevent fits coming\r\non. The brains of various birds and animals were highly esteemed. The\r\nlatter were roasted and rubbed on children’s gums when teething. The\r\nlivers of ducks and frogs, and a dead mouse dried and beaten into\r\npowder, were given to relieve kidney disease.\r\n\r\nAnother extraordinary article used in medicine was the horn of that\r\nfabulous animal the unicorn. Concerning its origin we have recourse\r\nagain to Pomet, who states, “the unicorn is an animal which our\r\nnaturalists describe under the figure of a horse, having in the middle\r\nof his head a spiral horn of two or three feet long, but we know not\r\nthe real truth of this matter to this day”. This horn was formerly held\r\nin high esteem because of the great virtues attributed to it by the\r\nancients, especially against poisons, “which is the reason that so many\r\ngreat persons are fond of it, so that it has been valued at its weight\r\nin gold”.\r\n\r\nAmbrose Paraens, in a treatise which he wrote on the unicorn, says that\r\nin the deserts of Arabia he found wild asses carrying a horn in the\r\nfront, which they used to fight against the bulls. That there _was_ an\r\nanimal with one horn, most of the old writers agree, but whether it was\r\na goat, or an ox, or a hart, or an ass, no one could say. The horn was\r\nprobably collected from any of these animals, and as long as the horn\r\nwas there it doubtless answered the purpose. The _true_ unicorn, if you\r\ndare believe Ludovicus Vertomanus, who says he saw two of them in Mecca\r\nwhich were kept within the precincts of Mahomet’s sepulchre, is of a\r\nweasel colour, “with the head like that of a hart, the neck not long,\r\nand the mane growing all on one side, the legs slender and lean like\r\nthe legs of a hind, hoofs cloven like a goat’s feet, and the hinder\r\nlegs all hairy and shaggy on the outside. His horn was wreathed in\r\nspires of an ivory colour.” There is little doubt that most of the horn\r\nused medicinally, was that obtained from the narwhal or sea unicorn. In\r\nthe year 1553 a great unicorn’s horn was brought to the King of France,\r\nand valued at £20,000 sterling. That which was presented to Charles I.\r\nof England is supposed to have been one of the largest ever seen in\r\nthe world. “It was seven feet long, weighed thirteen pounds, and was\r\nin the shape of a wax candle, but wreathed within itself in spires,\r\nhollow about a foot from its root, growing taper little by little\r\ntowards the point of polished smoothness, and the colour not perfectly\r\nwhite.” Ancient authors ascribe wonderful properties to the horn of\r\nthe unicorn. It was supposed to resist all kinds of poisons, cure the\r\nplague, all manner of fevers, the biting of serpents, mad dogs, etc.,\r\nand was chiefly used as a cordial, for which purpose a jelly was made\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  THE ORIGIN OF THE SOCIETY OF APOTHECARIES—APOTHECARIES AND THEIR\r\n    PRACTICE—APOTHECARIES AND THEIR BILLS—CURIOUS REMEDIES—A DRUG\r\n    PRICE LIST OF 1685.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest record of the apothecary in England seems to be of one\r\nRichard Fitznigel, who acted in that capacity to Henry II. This\r\nindividual subsequently rose in degree at Court, and exchanging the\r\npestle for the crozier, eventually became Bishop of London. In 1345\r\nwe hear of one Coursus de Gangland receiving for his services as\r\napothecary to Edward III., and for taking care of and attending his\r\nMajesty during his illness in Scotland, a pension of sixpence a day.\r\n\r\nThose who practised medicine, surgery, and pharmacy were called\r\nphysicians, while their assistants were known as apothecaries. Many\r\nof the latter, as they began to learn the secrets and habits of their\r\nemployers, began business on their own account, also dealing in drugs\r\nand other commodities, until they became a powerful body.\r\n\r\nWhen the College of Physicians was established in 1518, they were soon\r\nempowered “to search, view, and see the apothecaries’ wares, drugs and\r\nstuffs, and destroy such as they found unfit for use”.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the century a distinct separation took place, and\r\nwe find that in 1600 there were physicians, surgeons, apothecaries,\r\nbarber surgeons, druggists or distillers and sellers of waters and\r\noils, and preparers of chemical medicines. It was not until the year\r\n1617 that the Apothecaries’ Society had a separate existence, when it\r\nwas enacted that no grocer should keep an apothecary’s shop, and that\r\nno surgeon should sell medicines.\r\n\r\nIn 1623 the Society of Apothecaries established a dispensary, for the\r\npurpose of making some of the most important medicines then used in\r\na uniform manner, and in May, 1618, the first _Pharmacopœia_ was\r\npublished by the College of Physicians. We are told that it was so\r\nimperfect that they brought out an improved edition in December of\r\nthe same year. This was published in Latin, and it was through making\r\nand publishing his translation of this work that Nicholas Culpepper\r\n(who was a man of common-sense in his time) got into disgrace with the\r\nCollege of Physicians, who in consequence refused him a licence to\r\npractise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing, dated 1490.]\r\n\r\nThe history of the Society of Apothecaries of London is an interesting\r\none. It is a mystery or guild which has retained its original function\r\nof a trading corporation. It arose as an offshoot of the Grocers’\r\nCompany, which descended from the pepperers and the spicers, who\r\namalgamated in 1345 under the name of the Fraternity of St. Anthony.\r\nThe Grocers’ Company is one of the most powerful and wealthy of the\r\ntwelve great Livery Companies of London which have survived from\r\nmediæval times.\r\n\r\nKing James I. appears to have interested himself in the separation of\r\nthe two bodies about the year 1614, and in spite of vigorous opposition\r\nby the grocers, a charter was granted on 6th December, 1617, making\r\nthe apothecaries a distinct mystery, under the title of the Society of\r\nApothecaries. This charter restrained the grocers and all other persons\r\nfrom keeping an apothecary’s shop in or near London, and it gave the\r\nSociety a right which had been inherent in the Grocers’ Company, of\r\npaying domiciliary visits to the apothecaries’ shops to search for, to\r\nseize, and destroy bad drugs and medicines, a power at first limited\r\nto London and seven miles round, but afterwards extended throughout\r\nEngland and Wales. This was discontinued shortly after 1833.\r\n\r\nThe first hall or council-house of the society consisted of a house and\r\ngrounds known as Cobham House, in Water Lane, Blackfriars, immediately\r\nbehind what is now the Ludgate Hill Station. It was purchased in 1633,\r\nmainly through the instrumentality of Gideon Delaune, chief apothecary\r\nto Anne of Denmark, who was one of the retinue sent to attend her from\r\nNorway when she became the wife of James I. This hall was destroyed by\r\nthe great fire of London in 1666, and its site lay vacant for ten years\r\nbefore it was rebuilt. The second hall was enlarged and improved in\r\n1786, and it still stands.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Anne, Prince George of Denmark, who was then Lord\r\nHigh Admiral, applied to the society to know if they would undertake\r\nto supply the navy with drugs, as it was very badly served at that\r\ntime. This the society agreed to do, and for so doing was drawn into a\r\nlong series of quarrels with the College of Physicians, whose members\r\nthought it was the duty of an apothecary “to remember his office is\r\nonly to be the physician’s cooke”.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of herbs and simples was soon found necessary to these\r\nearly compounders of medicine, and as a means of instruction, botanical\r\nexcursions or herborisings, as they were called in those days, soon\r\nformed a prominent feature of the society. This led eventually to\r\nthe decision to rent a physic garden, for which purpose the gardens\r\navailable near the hall were unsuitable, and in 1673 the Botanic Garden\r\nat Chelsea was leased to the apothecaries for a term of sixty-one\r\nyears, by Charles Cheyne, Esq., lord of the manor.\r\n\r\nThe custom of examination grew up within the society very gradually,\r\nthe first examinations being found necessary to ascertain whether the\r\napprentices could decipher the very illegible handwriting in which the\r\nphysicians wrote their prescriptions or bills, an accomplishment for\r\nwhich apparently they have been ever famous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF AN APOTHECARY’S SHOP.\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Drapentier, 1670.]\r\n\r\nThen came the division of the apothecaries from the druggists,\r\nthe former in the process of time becoming a subordinate class of\r\npractitioners who attended an individual afflicted with some internal\r\ndisease not requiring external or manual aid, and who prescribed for\r\nthe cure of such complaint and supplied the medicine; while the latter\r\nwere supposed to confine themselves to the dealing in and preparation\r\nof drugs for the apothecary.\r\n\r\nThe apothecary was paid for the medicine which he supplied, which\r\nwas not by any means in small quantities, and so was supposed not to\r\nencroach ostensibly upon the province of the physician, who received\r\nhis remuneration for advice only, and did not provide medicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1812 a tax was put upon glass which increased the price of bottles\r\ngreatly, much to the chagrin of the apothecaries, who were paid\r\naccording to the number of draughts and potions which they could induce\r\ntheir patients to swallow. It was customary to place each dose of\r\nmedicine in a separate bottle, and charge it at the rate of one or two\r\nshillings a dose, so the apothecary naturally felt aggrieved at the\r\nglass tax, which, however, was soon afterwards repealed.\r\n\r\nThe following excellent rules and regulations were laid down by William\r\nBulleyn for the guidance of apothecaries of his time:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE APOTICARYE.\r\n\r\n  1. Must first serve God, foresee the end, be cleanly, pity the poor.\r\n\r\n  2. Must not be suborned for money to hurt mankind.\r\n\r\n  3. His place of dwelling and shop to be cleanly, to please the\r\n  senses withal.\r\n\r\n  4. His garden must be at hand, with plenty of herbs, seeds, and\r\n  roots.\r\n\r\n  5. To sow, set, plant, gather, preserve, and keep them in due time.\r\n\r\n  6. To read Dioscorides; to know the nature of plants and herbs.\r\n\r\n  7. To invent medicines; to choose by colour, taste, odour, figure,\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\n  8. To have his mortars, stills, pots, filters, glasses, and boxes\r\n  clean and sweet.\r\n\r\n  9. To have charcoals at hand to make decoctions, syrups, etc.\r\n\r\n  10. To keep his clean ware close, and cast away the baggage.\r\n\r\n  11. To have two places in his shop—one most clean for the physic,\r\n  and a baser place for the chirurgic stuff.\r\n\r\n  12. That he neither increase nor diminish the physician’s bill\r\n  (_i.e._, prescription), and keep it for his own discharge.\r\n\r\n  13. That he neither buy nor sell rotten drugs.\r\n\r\n  14. That he peruse often his wares that they corrupt not.\r\n\r\n  15. That he put not in _quid pro quo_ without advisement.\r\n\r\n  16. That he may open well a vein for to help pleurisy.\r\n\r\n  17. That he meddle only in his vocation.\r\n\r\n  18. That he delight to read Nicolaus, Myrepsus, Valerius, Cordus,\r\n  Johannes Placaton, the Lubri, etc.\r\n\r\n  19. That he do remember his office is only to be the physician’s\r\n  cook.\r\n\r\n  20. That he use true measure and weight.\r\n\r\n  21. To remember his end and the judgment of God; and thus do I\r\n  commend him to God, if he be not covetous or crafty, seeking his\r\n  own lucre before other men’s help, succour and comfort.\r\n\r\nIn Glasgow the sale of drugs and poisons was carefully restricted and\r\nregulated as far back as 1599. Under the terms of a charter granted to\r\nthe Faculty by King James VI., and dated November, 1599, visitors were\r\nappointed, and they were given\r\n\r\n  “Full power to call, sumonnd, and convene before thame, within the\r\n  said burgh of Glasgow, or onie otheris of ouir said burrowis, or\r\n  publict places of the foirsaids boundis, all personis professing\r\n  or using the said airt of Chirurgie, to examine thame upon thair\r\n  literature, knawledge and practize; gif they be fund wordie, to\r\n  admit, allow, and approve thame, give them testimonial according\r\n  to the airt and knawledge that they sal be fund wordie to exercise\r\n  thareftir, resave thair aithis, and authorize thame as accordis,\r\n  and to discharge thame to use onie farder nor they have knawledge\r\n  passing their capacity, laist our subjectis be abusit”.\r\n\r\nIt was further provided by “James, be the Grace of God, King of\r\nScottis,” in his fatherly solicitude for his subjects, that\r\n\r\n  “The saidis visitouris sall visit everie hurt, murtherit, poisonit,\r\n  or onie other persoun tane awa extraordinarily, and to report to\r\n  the Magistrate of the fact as it is”.\r\n\r\nThe visitors were also empowered, with the advice of their brethren, to\r\nmake regulations for the common weal anent the art of surgery, and to\r\ninflict punishment upon those infringing them. With regard to the sale\r\nof drugs, it was provided that—\r\n\r\n  “Na manir of personis sell onie droggis within the Citie of\r\n  Glasgow, except the sam be sichtit be the saidis visitouris, and\r\n  be William Spang, apothecar, under the pane of confiscatioune of\r\n  the droggis”.\r\n\r\nThe responsibility of the seller is clearly defined in a clause which\r\nfurther stipulates that—\r\n\r\n  “Nane sell retoun poison, asenick, or sublemate, under the pane of\r\n  ane hundred merkis, excep onlie the apothecaries quha sall be bund\r\n  to take cautioun of the byaris, for coist, skaith, and damage”.\r\n\r\nThese powers were confirmed by Charles, “King of Great Britain, France,\r\nand Ireland”.\r\n\r\nThe ancient apothecary believed in the administration of physic in\r\nquantities which, in these advanced days of infinitesimal doses and\r\nconcentrated preparations, would be considered something alarming.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting extract is from the diary of William\r\nBlundell, a celebrated cavalier of Lancashire, who took an active part\r\nin many of the conflicts in Cromwell’s time. On being taken ill, we are\r\ntold, he sent for his medical man, one Dr. Worthington, of Wigan. The\r\ndoctor’s bill, together with some quaint remarks thereon, are entered\r\nin the cavalier’s diary by his man, Master Thelwall, as follows:—\r\n\r\n1681. “After my master had been long ill of a violent cold, Dr.\r\nWorthington came first unto him on 8th January. He staid two nights,\r\nand received for his pains £1 10s. He brought along with him, a\r\nlohoch, ten pills, with a bottle of spirits somewhat bigger than\r\none’s thumb, and a paper of lozenges, with French barley and several\r\ningredients for making the water thereof. On the eleventh day he sent\r\na glister, with a large pint bottle of a cordial julep, and a small\r\nbottle of syrups, to be sucked up with a liquorice stick, also some\r\nsmall quantity of sal prunella.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing by Amman, Sixteenth Century.]\r\n\r\n“The doctor was with my master the second time, on 17th January, and\r\nreceived for his pains 15s.”\r\n\r\nThen comes the copy of Dr. Worthington’s bill, dated 24th October,\r\n1681:—\r\n\r\n                             £ _s._ _d._\r\n     Spirits                 0   4   6\r\n     An ointment             0   1   4\r\n  January 8.\r\n     Spirits                 0   4   6\r\n     Ten pills               0   2   0\r\n     A lohoch                0   2   0\r\n     Lozenges                0   4   0\r\n     Jujubes and sibertines  0   0   8\r\n     French barley           0   1   0\r\n     Ingredients             0   1   6\r\n     Syrups                  0   3   0\r\n     A cordial julep         0  10   6\r\n     A glister               0   2   6\r\n  January 11.\r\n     Syrups                  0   3   0\r\n     White powder            0   0   4\r\n     Five pills              0   1   3\r\n     The oiled sugar         0   7   0\r\n     Syrups                  0   5   6\r\n     Oil of sweet almonds    0   1   8\r\n     Spirits of ptisanne     0   7   6\r\n     For a messenger         0   1   6\r\n                            ----------\r\n                            £3   5   3\r\n                            ==========\r\n\r\nMaster Thelwall then goes on to say: “My master’s opinion of these\r\nseveral things in particular, is here to be inserted for further\r\nuse, _viz._, that the spirits first named, of which twenty-six drops\r\nwere put into one small cup of barley water and beer, had no apparent\r\neffect, although he doth not much doubt but the secret effect might\r\nbe good. That the like might be said of the pills, mentioned in two\r\nplaces, although it seemed that they did somewhat assuage his cough,\r\nwhich was extremely violent. The lohoch, a liquor like syrup, did\r\napparently bring up phlegm, and was well liked. The lozenges were\r\npleasant, and did sometimes stop the cough. Barley water with the\r\ningredients was cooling and pleasant. Syrups twice mentioned, although\r\nof much different prices, seemed to be the same.\r\n\r\n“The cordial julep, of which there was a large pint bottle, was\r\npleasant, but the effect not apparent. The glister extraordinary\r\neffective and good. White powder, supposed to be sal prunella, assuaged\r\nthe thirst. The oiled sugar, with the spirits ptisanne, besides the\r\nextreme dearness, was almost wholly useless, in regard that the patient\r\nbeing much in the mending hand when they were sent unto him. He sent\r\nback to the doctor about seven-eighths of the oiled sugar, and yet he\r\npaid for the whole. The oil of sweet almonds, of which seven or eight\r\ndrops were taken in a bolus of white sugar-candy, frequently helped\r\nthe breast made very sore by coughing.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN APOTHECARY.\r\n\r\nFrom a drawing, 1641.]\r\n\r\nWe subsequently learn that the good old cavalier was at length cured\r\nof his ailments, which he certainly ought to have been from the\r\nmultiplicity of the remedies employed. Many of the forms in which\r\nmedicine was administered in those days have entirely gone out of use,\r\nand others we have still with us.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the apothecary’s bill appears in the appendix to the\r\n_Eleventh Report of the Historical Manuscripts’ Commission_, among the\r\ntranscripts of the manuscripts of the Marquess Townshend. There is one,\r\ndated 24th June, 1619, of a paper endorsed “The Apothycarie’s bill,”\r\nSir Roger Townshend’s account, which contains the following items:—\r\n\r\n                             _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  “Grene ginger”               7   0\r\n  Tabacco                      2   0\r\n  Grene ginger                 8   0\r\n  A masse of pills             5   0\r\n  An electuarye                3   6\r\n\r\nUnder the name of Mr. Stanhope Townshend, 12th September, 1618, are:—\r\n\r\n                             _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  “A clyster”                  3   4\r\n  A julep                      3   0\r\n  A cordiall with behoardston  3   0\r\n  The cordiall julep           3   0\r\n  Hearbs for brothe            0   4\r\n  Rose water                   0   6\r\n  A suppositorye               0   6\r\n  Another suppositorye         0   6\r\n  An unguent                   0   3\r\n  A purge                      3   0\r\n  Purgeing pills               2   6\r\n\r\nThe lohoch, the base of which consisted of honey or thick syrup, was\r\na very favourite form of medicine for a cough, such as the lohoch\r\ndemulcent, lohoch of fox’s lungs, and lohoch expectorant.\r\n\r\nThe julep was another ancient form of administration much in vogue.\r\nBalsams, of divers compositions, had great repute as expectorants.\r\nWilliam Blundell in his diary (1681) mentions: “The Elder Lady Bradshaw\r\nsent a bottle containing, as we guess, about one ounce of balsam,\r\nwhich in her letter she calls ‘Balsam of Sulphur’. That it must be\r\ntaken morning and night, three or four drops, naked and alone in a\r\nspoon; that it must be warmed before it will drop at all, by reason its\r\nthick and clammy.” The sugared oils were simply made by triturating\r\nvarious essential oils with white sugar, and usually given for their\r\ncarminative action.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite vehicle was broth, generally composed of many and\r\nstrange ingredients. We have come across the broth of calves’ lungs,\r\nbroth of the bones of lizards, and broths made from snails, tortoises,\r\nwoodlice, crabs, and vipers.\r\n\r\nThe recipe for the broth of viper we have taken from an old\r\nblack-letter book, and is rather curious:—\r\n\r\n      “℞ Living viper             j.\r\n\r\n  Remove his head, tail and viscera, excepting his heart and liver,\r\n  cut it into little pieces and mix it with the blood, and add—\r\n\r\n      Well water           12 ounces\r\n\r\n  in a close vessel, boil for two hours and strain, and the broth\r\n  will be made.”\r\n\r\nThe _materia medica_ of the old apothecary was largely drawn from the\r\nanimal kingdom, the greater part of it being, no doubt, handed down\r\nfrom a very early period, when witchcraft and superstition exerted a\r\npowerful influence on the minds of the people.\r\n\r\nAmong the many curious things used, we find that the liver of a mad\r\ndog, or a wolf, washed in wine and dried in a stove, was employed as\r\na remedy for hydrophobia. The nimble lizard had a reputation as a\r\nsudorific and antisyphilitic. Dried toads and the cast-off skins of\r\nsnakes and adders, were administered in dropsy as a diuretic.\r\n\r\nThe horn of rhinoceros was used in epilepsy, and goat’s blood and eel’s\r\nliver as a cure for dysentery. The oil of frog’s spawn was celebrated\r\nas an application for chilblains. The jawbone of a pike and the spine\r\nof a lamprey in powder, were prescribed for leucorrhœa. Pepys\r\nmentions in his diary, that he wore a hare’s foot as a sovereign remedy\r\nagainst the plague, in which charm he seemed to place more faith than\r\nin the various plague waters that were recommended to him as unfailing\r\nantidotes for that terrible disease.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Edward I. there was a list of drugs recorded by the\r\nking’s physician, one Nicholas de Tyngewyke, in 1307, which throws an\r\ninteresting light on the pharmacy of that period. The list includes\r\ndistilled oil of turpentine, aromatic flowers for baths, carminative\r\nelectuaries, plasters and ointments of various kinds, the oils\r\nof wheat, ash, and bay, water of the roses of Damascus, wine of\r\npomegranates, remedies prepared from pearls, jacinths, and coral, and\r\nmany other drugs. The king was taken ill at Carlisle, and the cost of\r\nconveying these remedies from London to that city amounted to £159 11s.\r\n10d., the apothecary’s bill for the medicines being £134 16s. 4d.\r\n\r\nIn 1596 Sir Henry Winton, who was sent as ambassador by Elizabeth\r\nto Henry IV. of France, met with an accident while on his mission.\r\nAccording to the records “he was physicked with _confectio alcarmas_,\r\nwhich was composed of musk, amber, gold, pearl, and unicorn’s horn, and\r\nwith pigeons applied to his side, and all other means that art could\r\ndevise sufficient to expel the strongest poison, and he be not bewitcht\r\nwithall”.\r\n\r\nThe apothecaries of the seventeenth century were not overburdened with\r\nthe estimable virtue of modesty, as instanced in the following quaint\r\nannouncement:—\r\n\r\n“Cornelius Tilbury, sworn chirurgeon-in-ordinary to K. Charles II., to\r\nhis late Sovereign K. William, as also to her present Majesty Queen\r\nAnne—address at the Blue Flower Pot, in Great Lincoln’s Inn Fields, at\r\nHolbourn Row (where you see at night a light over the door); and for\r\nthe convenience of those that desire privacy, they may come through the\r\nRed Lyon Inn in Holbourn, between the two turnstiles, which is directly\r\nagainst my back door, where you will see the sign of the Blue Ball hung\r\nover the door.\r\n\r\n“I dispose of my famous Orvietan, either liquid or in powder, what\r\nquantity or price you please. This is that Orvietan that expelled that\r\nvast quantity of poison I took before K. Charles II., for which his\r\nMajesty presented me with a gold medal and a chain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN APOTHECARY.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving, 1517.]\r\n\r\nThe physician’s fees were by no means small in the time of the\r\nCommonwealth, as may be judged from the following extract from the\r\n_Memoirs of the Verney Family_:—\r\n\r\n“Sir Theodore Mayerne is buryed,” writes Dr. Denton, “and died worth\r\n£140,000.” Sir Ralph thought £30 too small a fee to pay Dr. Denton for\r\nhis attendance on his wife during her confinement, but for his pressing\r\npoverty he would have sent him £50, equal to about £200 of our present\r\nmoney. Dr. Radcliffe’s regular fees were estimated to bring him in\r\nan income of at least £4000 a year; Dr. Mead’s were valued at between\r\n£5000 and £6000. Sir George Wheler’s sickness, after a Christmas dinner\r\nat Dr. Denton’s, cost him “the best part of £100”. He had caught a\r\nchill after dancing, which turned to “a spotted feavour”; Sir George\r\nEnt was called in: he had all sorts of “Applications of Blisters and\r\nLoudanums”. “My Apothecary’s ... bill came to £28. He was a good man,\r\nand told me if I fell into a feavour again, Sage Possit would do me as\r\nmuch good as all the Physitians Prescriptions.”\r\n\r\nIn Sir Daniel Fleming’s account books we have record of the amount paid\r\nto medical practitioners in 1659, as follows:—\r\n\r\n  To Doctor Dykes for comeing and laying plasters unto Will    £0 10 0\r\n\r\n  For his plaisters and paines contributed towards the cure\r\n      of Will, the sum of                                       5  0 0\r\n\r\nA further entry also shows the value of the midwife’s services at the\r\nsame period. Under date\r\n\r\n  July 30th, 1659. Given unto Daniel Harrison’s wife for being my\r\n  wife’s midwife, 5/-.\r\n\r\nIn the household books of Lord William Howard we learn that on 25th\r\nSeptember, 1612, he paid one Mr. Adamson, an apothecary of Keswick,\r\n“for xxii dayes and his physick, £xiii. vi,s. viii,d”.\r\n\r\nSome of the early preparations used in pharmacy were as elaborate as\r\nthey were mysterious. The Treacle of Andromachus the elder, a recipe of\r\ngreat antiquity, contained sixty-three ingredients; and the celebrated\r\nMithridate of Damocratis contained forty-eight.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the formula for “Mithridates” is ascribed to Mithridates,\r\nKing of Pontus, whose recipe Pompey brought to Rome, where Damocratis\r\nsang its praises and proclaimed its virtues. It was considered by the\r\nancients a panacea for every ill. Of the historic preparation known as\r\nthe Treacle of Andromachus, its invention is attributed to that worthy.\r\nPliny says that the formula of a similar composition was inscribed in\r\nverse 300 years before the Christian era upon the temple of Æsculapius,\r\nand that Andromachus merely imitated, by order of Nero, the composition\r\nof the Mithridate, which had then been known for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nOf the forms of administration there were a great variety in the\r\nsixteenth century, and many, such as the Rob which consisted of the\r\njuice of fruits boiled down to two-thirds, the lohoch, and the treacle,\r\nhave quite gone out of use.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding modern research and scientific advance, some of\r\nthe ancient formulæ still survive and are employed to-day.\r\n\r\nIt may not be generally known that the preparation known as hiera picra\r\nwas originated by Galen, on the properties of which he placed high\r\nvalue on account of its excessively bitter taste. Charas states that\r\nthe great physician gave it the name of hiera picra or holy bitter.\r\n\r\nIn the _pil. aloes. et myrrh._ of the _British Pharmacopœia_,\r\ncommonly known by the old name of _Pil. Ruffi._, we have a formula\r\nhanded down intact for over a thousand years.\r\n\r\nIn mediæval times ladies were not above using preparations to beautify\r\ntheir complexions, and among others for this purpose, we find the\r\nformula of a cerate composed of white wax, spermaceti, oil of cole\r\nseed, bismuth, borax, and alum, which was spread on a cloth to cover\r\nthe face at night, and worn as a mask.\r\n\r\nAmong the parts of the body used as medicine was human blood, on which\r\nsome early physicians set great value for the cure of epilepsy and\r\ndiseases of the brain.\r\n\r\nCharas, in his _Royal Pharmacopœia_, says: “In the month of May take\r\na considerable quantity of healthy young men’s blood, let blood in that\r\nseason who are _not red haired_. This blood is to be distilled twice,\r\nor spread on plates and dried in the sun or an oven. All writers extol\r\nthe volatile salt of man’s blood, for the cure of epilepsy, it being\r\nalso very proper to suppress vapours that arise from the stomach and\r\nspleen.”\r\n\r\nIn a Celtic leech-book preserved in the University of Leyden, which is\r\nsaid to have been written in the ninth century, there are the following\r\ncurious recipes:—\r\n\r\n  “1. To prevent wrinkles. Smear the face with a mixture of water and\r\n  the pounded root of wild cucumber. Wash with cold water. ‘Hóc sí\r\n  triduo fac_er_e uolueris mirabile_m_ effectu_m_ uidebis.’\r\n\r\n  “2. To remove freckles. Rub a bull’s gall on the face.\r\n\r\n  “3. To cure headaches. Gather plantain-root before sunrise, and tie\r\n  it on the head. Use also the juice of the seed of the elder-tree,\r\n  a cow’s brain, goat’s dung dissolved in vinegar; swallows’ nests\r\n  mixed with water, and applied to the forehead; water out of which\r\n  an ass or an ox has drunk.\r\n\r\n  “4. To purge the head. Pour the juice of cabbage (_brassica_) into\r\n  the nostrils.\r\n\r\n  “5. For dimness of the eyes. Pound fennel-roots, mix with honey,\r\n  and boil over a slow fire; add cistern-water or woman’s milk. Smear\r\n  the eyes with the fat of a fox (_adipe volpis_).\r\n\r\n  “6. Another remedy. Mix a child’s urine (_lotium infantis_) with\r\n  the best honey; add a decoction of fennel-roots (‘omnem caliginem\r\n  mirabiliter discutiet’).\r\n\r\n  “7. The beginning of this paragraph has been cut off. The remedies\r\n  prescribed are butter and _cram occifæth_ (garlic...?), mixed with\r\n  ram’s fat (‘per aruinam ariætis’).\r\n\r\n  “14. To cure the bite of a dog. Apply two or three onions calcined\r\n  and boiled with lard and honey.\r\n\r\n  “15. To extract a straw from the eye. Chant the psalm _Qui\r\n  habitat_ (Ps. 90) thrice over water, with which then douche the\r\n  eye, _et sanus ærit_.”\r\n\r\nAmong the various remedies fish play a prominent part. For gravel it is\r\nrecommended that the head of a pike be boiled in a newly-glazed earthen\r\npot, then reduced to powder and drunk in a glass of white wine. A sure\r\nmeans of curing gout is to wear continually three or four moles’ feet\r\ntied to one’s garters. For nose-bleeding, the sufferer is advised to\r\nblow up the nose the powder of a stone found in the head of a carp, or\r\nto plug up the nostrils with hare’s fur. A certain remedy for curing\r\na drunkard of his evil way is to give him as many eggs of the screech\r\nowl, boiled hard, as he can possibly eat, when we are assured he will\r\never after be a total abstainer.\r\n\r\nIn the first book of the _Secretes of the reverent Maister Alexis\r\nof Piemont_, 1562, which is a kind of general receipt-book for the\r\napothecaries of the time, there occur some curious formulæ, which may\r\nbe taken as a fair example of the pharmacy of those days. The process\r\nof making the oil of red dog is given with elaborate detail.\r\n\r\n“To make an oile of a redde dogge,” says the chronicler, “by the meane\r\nwhereof (beside other infinit vertues that it hathe) I have healed a\r\nFryer of Saint Onostres, who had by the space of twelve years a lame\r\nand drye withered arme, lyke I styche so that nature gave it no more\r\nnouryshement—\r\n\r\n“Take a yonge dogge of redde heare and keep him three days without\r\nmeate, and then strangle him with a corde, and let him lie dead a\r\nquarter of an houre, and in the meane time boyle a kettell of ayle up\r\nby the fire, and putte the dogge in whole, or in pieces, it maketh no\r\nmatter howe, so that he be all there with the skynne and heare; make\r\nhim seethe so untyl he be almost sodden to pieces, keepying always the\r\nkettell close covered: In the meane tyme take scorpions to the number\r\nof four score or a hundred, and put them in a basyn on the fyre untyll\r\nthey be thoroughly bruised. Then putte them in the sayde kettell with\r\nthe ayle and the dogge, puttinge to it a good dishful of great grounde\r\nwormes, well washed, a good handful of Saint John’s Worte, a handful\r\nof wylde marshe mallowes, and a handful of wallworte, with an once of\r\nsaffron. Seethe all these things well to-gether, and then let it ware\r\ncolde.” The liquid being strained off and certain aromatic gums added,\r\nthe preparation was complete.\r\n\r\nThe belief that carrying a piece of camphor will ward off infectious\r\ndiseases, is a relic of the old days of amulets and charms. In 1547\r\nAlexis recommended compounds to carry against the plague and fever, and\r\nwe find that aromatics were used to perfume clothes in the time of the\r\nearly Jews, long before the birth of Christ.\r\n\r\nAmong other secrets of Alexis, there is a curious recipe to “_cause\r\nmervelous dreames_”.\r\n\r\n“Take the bloode of a lampwink or black plover, and rubbe your temples\r\nwith it and so goe to bedde, and you shall see mervelous thinges in\r\nyour sleepe; or else if you eate at nighte a little of the herbe Solani\r\nor Visicaria, or some Mandragora, or elles of the herbe called in\r\nGreek Hyoscymus, in Latin hath these names, Altercum, Appolinaris, and\r\nSymphonia, and in the English some call it Henbane, and you shall see\r\nin the nighte goodly things in your dreame.”\r\n\r\nThe apothecary apparently omits to mention that a heavy meal of very\r\nordinary cheese, combined with the succulent fruit of the cucumber,\r\nbefore you go to bed, will also make you see marvellous and weird\r\nthings in your sleep.\r\n\r\nThe gifts and wisdom of the apothecaries were according to their\r\nwritings very wonderful, but none perhaps is more remarkable than the\r\nfollowing recipe on a matter which would baffle the scientists of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler writes: “To make a woman that beareth alwaies daughters\r\nto beare also sonnes, it is a thing very easy, and hath good succes,\r\nand hathe been divers times proved. Let her eate an herbe in English\r\ncalled mercurie, which hath only two seedes; also the skrapings of an\r\nelephant’s tooth.”\r\n\r\nThe name of the originator of the “everlasting pill” has not been\r\nhanded down to posterity, but whoever he was, he was certainly an\r\neconomist, and could not be charged with inventing it for his own\r\ngain. It consisted of a small globule of metallic antimony, which was\r\nbelieved to have the property of purging as often as it was swallowed.\r\n\r\nA single pill of this kind would serve a whole family during their\r\nlives, and was doubtless, transmitted as an heirloom to posterity.\r\n\r\nParis says, “we have heard of a lady who, having swallowed one of these\r\npills, became seriously alarmed at its not passing through”. “Madam,”\r\nsaid her physician, “fear not; it has already passed through a hundred\r\npatients without any difficulty.”\r\n\r\nIt is said to have been the constant custom of Cardinal Wolsey to carry\r\nin his hand an orange deprived of its contents and filled with a sponge\r\nsoaked in vinegar, impregnated with various spices, in order to protect\r\nhim from infection when passing through the crowds of people which his\r\nsplendour of office attracted.\r\n\r\nAn old writer, one James Penrose of the middle ages, questions if\r\nCleopatra applied the asp to her breast as is commonly supposed,\r\nbecause, as he remarks, “the veines are so very slender”.\r\n\r\n“Petrus Victorius blames the painters who depict the Egyptian queen\r\napplying the asp to her breast, seeing it is manifest out of Plutarch\r\nin the life of Antonius, and out of Plinie likewise, that she applied\r\nit to her arme.”\r\n\r\n“Zonares relates, that there appeared no signe of death upon her, save\r\ntwo blew spots on her arme.”\r\n\r\n“Cæsar also in her statue, which he carryed in tryumph, applyed the\r\nasp to her arme; for in the armes there are great veines and arteries\r\nwhich doe quickly and in a straight way convey the venom to the heart,\r\nwhereas in the papps the vessels are slender.”\r\n\r\nGesnerus gives a method used by the apothecaries for changing the\r\ncolour of the hair which is somewhat singular. It is by means of one\r\nof the many waters of the philosophers, and is made as follows, in\r\nthe language of the text: “Take a moule which serveth unto the dying\r\nor coloring of heares whyte, eyther of man or beast; let the moule\r\nbe artely brought to powder with Brimstone, adde to it the juice of\r\ncelandine which orderly be myxed, let to stande for certaine dayes,\r\nafter dystill the whole according to taste. The virtue of this water is\r\nin such wise, that if a beast wholy blacke of heare shall be washed all\r\nover with this water, the heare shall in that time became so whyte as\r\nsnowe.”\r\n\r\nThe aloe mentioned in the Bible, usually in connection with myrrh and\r\nfrankincense, is not the same drug as that used in medicine to-day, and\r\nis even without its bitterness. It is the product of the _Aquilaria\r\nAgallocha_, a tree of large size growing in the Laos country and Assam.\r\nThe wood is light in colour and inodorous, but under certain conditions\r\na change takes place in it, and it becomes charged with a dark aromatic\r\njuice. It was formerly used as a spice in embalming, and is employed in\r\nChina and the East as incense in the temples.\r\n\r\nA curious little work, entitled _The House Apothecary_ written by\r\nDr. Gideon Harvey, physician-in-ordinary to his Majesty, and printed\r\nin 1670, affords a further interesting glimpse at pharmacy 200 years\r\nago. It would appear that the apothecaries then, like some of their\r\ndescendants of the present day, excited a considerable amount of\r\njealousy among the physicians by prescribing in certain cases, and\r\nmeddling generally “in matters which they did not understand”.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN APOTHECARY.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving, 1517.]\r\n\r\nThe worthy doctor begins by recommending people to prepare their\r\nmedicine at their own homes, it being a far safer and easier way\r\nthan sending it to the apothecary to be made, and as a further\r\ninducement states: “And you shall also save nineteen shillings in\r\ntwenty shillings, according to the extravagant rates charged by many\r\napothecaries, in so doing. I must tell you, I have oft seen bills of\r\napothecaries rise to twenty, and sometimes thirty pounds in the time\r\nof a fortnight; and what is more, I have known an apothecary’s bill so\r\nextravagant that the sum at the bottom of his account amounted to fifty\r\npounds in the space of thirty days, when the ingredients of the whole\r\ncourse could not be computed to stand him in forty shillings.” A severe\r\nindictment indeed.\r\n\r\nThe doctor then goes on to inform us that “in preparing medicines at\r\nhome you may be certain the ingredients are sound and fresh, and you\r\ncan have your medicines without attending the apothecary’s leisure or\r\nhaving the trouble of sending three or four times to his shop for them;\r\nand, most important of all, you may be assured in so doing you shall\r\nsave nine pounds in ten, and sometimes forty-eight pounds in fifty”.\r\n\r\nAnother treatise written to denounce the excessive charges of the\r\napothecaries was _The Accomplished Physician, the Honest Apothecary,\r\nand the Skilful Surgeon_, published and sold at the “Angel” in Duck\r\nLane, in 1656. It attacked the unfortunate apothecary on all sides.\r\nIt states that “if the apothecary finds you costive he sends you\r\na clyster, at the price of half a crown, which by consulting _The\r\nAccomplished Physician_, etc., you may learn how to make yourself for\r\nthree half-pence. If he apprehends your stomach to be oppressed, he\r\norders his man to boil a little cardamoms in water, strain it, and put\r\nto it three or four spoonsful of rank oil of sweet almonds, to cause\r\nyou to vomit and carry off a little phlegm, and for this he charges you\r\nhalf a crown, which you can make yourself for two-pence.”\r\n\r\nThe author finally confides to the public “that it is fortunate\r\nthat the little apothecaries and prescribing surgeons have not much\r\nknowledge of the great medicines, such as mercury and antimony, as they\r\nwould at most times do great mischief with them, using them at unseemly\r\ntimes, as if you laid hold of a club to knock down a louse; such great\r\nmedicines should only be used by the physicians, who should reserve\r\nthem in secret”.\r\n\r\nMost of the herbs and roots in common use were brought to the town\r\nmarkets and vended by the physical herb-women, who would bring them in\r\nbaskets to Newgate Market, Gutter Lane, or Covent Garden, and there\r\nsell them by the handful, a dozen for a groat. The measures in use\r\nwere of a very primitive description, chiefly the fascicle and the\r\npugil.\r\n\r\nIn 1656 a quart white glass bottle cost 1s. 6d., and a green glass\r\nretort 8d. Plague water at certain times was in great demand, and was\r\nusually sold at the apothecaries for 3s. 6d. a pint. The price of most\r\nconserves was 2d. an ounce, and ointments retailed at 8d. an ounce.\r\nAn ointment that was much in vogue and very popular among the people\r\nwas _Unguentum Ægyptiacum_, similar to the ointment of the great Felix\r\nWurtz. Its composition is somewhat interesting and quaint. “Take of\r\nverdigriese 12 drachms ground very fine in a brass mortar, observing\r\nwhile you are powdering to hold your head back from the mortar and\r\nkeep your mouth and nose stopped, to prevent those venomous steams\r\nfrom getting up into your brain. Then take 3 ounces of honey and 12\r\ndrachms of sharpest vinegar, place them in a broad brass pipkin, put\r\nin the verdigriese, stir and boil them on a gentle fire unto the\r\nthickness of an oyntment of a purple colour.” Of the waters in common\r\nuse the _Accomplished Physician_ gives directions for the preparation\r\nof several. The London treacle water, _aqua mirabilis_ and _aqua\r\nraphani composita_, were noted for scurvy. The London snail water was\r\nrecommended as an invaluable remedy in consumption, which, “owing to\r\nthe cool, clammy, and glutinous substance of the snail, facilitated the\r\nexpectoration and repaired the parts consumed”. Gascon’s powder, or\r\n_pulvis é chelis cancrorum_, was regarded as a valuable medicament, and\r\nmuch esteemed and ordered by the great physicians. It was an expensive\r\nmixture, and contained equal parts, in powder, of crab’s eyes, the\r\noriental pearl, red coral, white amber, oriental bezoar, and the black\r\ntops of crab’s claws. It was sometimes ordered and taken in the form\r\nof pills mixed with hartshorn jelly. The apothecary’s price for this\r\npowder was 40s. an ounce, or one penny per grain. We are told that if\r\nmade at home the cost would only be 13s. 1¼d. Another preparation\r\nexceedingly popular in the seventeenth century was the emplastrum\r\nopodeldock of Feliz Wurtz, “so much cried up among surgeons beyond\r\nthe sea”. It was a red plaster, composed of wax, Venice turpentine,\r\njuice of celandine, oak leaves, ammoniacum, galbanum, and vinegar.\r\nThen some powdered magnets, and such mysterious compounds as _Crocus\r\nMartis_, _Crocus Veneris_, and prepared tutria, were thrown in, and\r\nall boiled together. The following is extracted from an old price list\r\nof the seventeenth century, which gives a good idea of some of the\r\nextraordinary articles kept in the old apothecaries’ shops, and the\r\nprices charged. It is headed “Rates and prices currant of Druggs and\r\nother commodities, belonging to physick, as they are commonly sold at\r\nthe Apothecaries and Druggists in London, 1685”:—\r\n\r\n  Mother of Pearl                   6d. per oz.\r\n  Crab’s eyes                       5s. 4d. per lb.\r\n  Crab’s claws                      1s. 6d.   ”\r\n  Fox’s lungs                       2s.       ”\r\n  A mummy                           5s. 4d.   ”\r\n  Bone of stag’s heart              1s. 6d.   ”\r\n  Borax                             4s.       ”\r\n  Saltpetre                         10d.      ”\r\n  Jalap                             3s. 4d.   ”\r\n  Rhubarb                           14s.      ”\r\n  Liquorice                         1s.       ”\r\n  A boar’s tooth                    1s. each.\r\n  A dead man’s skull (cranium\r\n    humanum) according to size      8s. to 11s. each.\r\n  Musk                              5s. per drachm.\r\n  Bloodstone                        2s. 8d. per lb.\r\n  Opium                             12s.      ”\r\n  Elaterium                         36s. per oz.\r\n  Lac Sulphur                       3s.    ”\r\n  Red coral                         4s. per lb.\r\n  Oleum Copaibæ                     2s. per oz.\r\n  Gum acacia                        10s. per lb.\r\n  Turmerick                         8d. per lb.\r\n  Elicampane                        1s. 4d. per lb.\r\n  Galingal                          4s.       ”\r\n  Gentian                           8d.       ”\r\n  Spanish Liquorice                 6d.       ”\r\n  Hellebore, white                  1s.       ”\r\n  Hellebore, black                  1s. per lb.\r\n  Pyrethrum                         1s.    ”\r\n  Sarsaparil, according to its\r\n    goodness, from                  4s. to 5s. per lb.\r\n  Squills                           6d.           ”\r\n  Winter’s Bark                     2s.           ”\r\n  Lig.

In doing so, we should note\r\nhow the influence of superstition and charlatanry, with which the art\r\nof healing was surrounded and intermixed, has been gradually dispersed\r\nunder the searching light of science. One can picture the apothecary’s\r\nshop in the days of “good Queen Bess”. Up a narrow winding street,\r\npaved with round cobble stones, and no pathway to protect you from the\r\njostling and nudges of the passing chair-bearers, French pages, and\r\nwatermen who throng the thoroughfares, his abode may be denoted perhaps\r\nby the gilded crocodile which hangs over the doorway, accompanied by\r\na pole from which depends a pair of brightly-burnished metal pans,\r\ndenoting the practice of the chirurgical art. The overhanging gables\r\nof the half-timbered houses darken the low-roofed shop, through whose\r\nsmall windows filled with little panes of bottle glass, a very dim\r\nlight penetrates. A mysterious odour permeates the interior and strange\r\nthings are seen hanging from the rafters,—flying fish, tortoises, and\r\na long alligator float mid-air. Strings of poppy-heads, bunches of\r\nchamomile and centuary, also glass jars containing adders and worms\r\nadorn the counter. On one shelf an array of bright brass mortars, and\r\nround about on others, a great collection of quaint bottles and earthen\r\npots, containing electuaries, unguents, and lohochs; syrup bottles with\r\nlong curved spouts, and bladders full of seeds and wax. In the corner\r\nstands the great iron mortar, whose heavy pestle is suspended from a\r\nspring beam, and another is filled with little drawers to hold the gums\r\nand spices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN APOTHECARY.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving, 1517.]\r\n\r\nAway at the back a red glow appears from the furnace, and alembics,\r\nbig and little, lie about. At night the shop is crowded with poor\r\nwomen buying worm-seed for their children or treacle to drive out the\r\nmeasles, and with country people who have come for drugs and drenches\r\nfor their sick cattle. “There are serving-men waiting for their\r\nmasters’ purgatives and electuaries, or the fops’ facewashes of oil of\r\ntartar, _lac virginis_, and camphor dissolved in verjuice. Smart maids\r\nare buying conserves and sackets for their mistresses, or perfumes for\r\nmy lady’s chamber. Here desperadoes and rakish gallants could purchase\r\npoisons, and blushing maidens would buy their love charms and philtres,\r\nor antidotes to counteract the same. Some apothecaries kept a little\r\nroom for taking tobacco, furnished with silver trays, and a maple\r\nblock for cutting it, where the gallants met and gossiped, or learned\r\ntricks in smoking from fashionable professors, for nearly all the\r\napothecaries sold tobacco—real Timidado—nicotine cane, and pudding,\r\nas it was called.” The old apothecary’s prescriptions were composed\r\nof strange ingredients, sometimes crab’s eyes and boar’s teeth, or\r\npowdered pearls, and viper broth. He would recommend you a toad, well\r\ndried in the sun, put in a bag, and hung round the neck by a string\r\nlow enough to touch the region of the heart, to allay hæmorrhage. A\r\npreparation of garlic and honey smeared on the person was a certain\r\ncharm against the bites of vicious dogs and reptiles, or the stings of\r\nvenomous insects. Toothache could be charmed away by a few leaves of\r\nthe “shepherd’s purse” placed in the sole of the shoe. An excellent\r\nrecipe for sore eyes was the expressed juice of the calyx of the red\r\nhoneysuckle, provided always that the flowers were gathered kneeling\r\nand repeating nine Pater nosters in honour of the Trinity, nine more\r\n“to greet our Ladye,” and a creed. My Ladye Falkenbrydge’s recipe for\r\neye-water was much esteemed, and ran thus: “Corne-flowers gathered\r\nwith their cuppes and bruyse them; macerate them in snowe or snowe\r\nwater for twentye-foure houres, then dystyl in a moderate sandebath\r\nand applye it night and morning”. This was prescribed in 1553. A\r\nfavourite cure for rickety children was to pass them through the split\r\nstem of a tree. For ague, a very well salted herring, split open, was\r\napplied hot to the soles of the feet; or an emerald worn round the neck\r\nformed a potent charm against the same complaint. The learned Boorde,\r\nin his _Breviary of Health_, says: “The medical treatment of the day\r\nwas a mixture of religious theories, superstition, and white magic”.\r\nHe recommends for a bad rheum the application of oil of scorpions and\r\nfox fat; for a bruised skin, washing it with white wine and plastering\r\nwith an oak leaf; and he quaintly states “the best remedy for itching\r\nis long nails and scratching,” which, at any rate, is common-sense. To\r\npreserve the health and a good complexion, he recommends young maids to\r\nwipe their faces daily with a scarlet cloth, and only wash them once a\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar phase of pharmacy in those early days was the\r\ninstructions of the various apothecaries’ guilds to their members as to\r\nprayer. The compounder of prescriptions was directed to go down on his\r\nknees and supplicate before he commenced his labours. Many old herbals\r\nand works on pharmacy, especially in Germany, contain curious wood-cut\r\nillustrations of the apothecary at his devotional exercises. Cyriacus\r\nSchnaus, an apothecary of Nuremberg, published a book in 1565, wherein\r\nhe, in person, is represented as kneeling on a large mortar before a\r\nsacred picture. This custom may have been originated by the monks, many\r\nof whom followed the art of healing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHYSICIAN FORECASTING FROM THE URINE.\r\n\r\nFrom an engraving, 1517.]\r\n\r\nA writer of the time states that the itinerant dentist was also a\r\nwell-known figure at the street corner. For 100 marks he would put out\r\nboth your eyes, and quite cure your inflammation with one drop of his\r\n_aqua mirabilis_, at twelve-pence a drop. He offered you an antidote\r\nfrom stab or bullet for five marks, and by his side waved a banner\r\nstuck all over with horses’ teeth, to show his skill.\r\n\r\nHe cured your toothache by charms, sometimes writing mysterious words\r\non a paper, and burning it under your nose; or he would sear your teeth\r\nwith hot wires, most effectively; or make you inhale the hot vapour of\r\nhenbane seeds, and then show you the worms that he had conjured out,\r\nwhich are certes now wriggling in the water. He wore a chain of molar\r\nteeth around his neck, and shook them from time to time as he held up a\r\nbottle of liquid and called out: “These are the spirits that pass with\r\nthe blood into the rheum, to vex the teeth of men”. His descendants may\r\nstill be seen at the present day working wondrous cures, decked out in\r\nsimilar fantastic garb, or extracting teeth gratis, and by sheer bold\r\nimpudence reaping a golden harvest.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown how the now almost forgotten pioneers of science laid\r\nthe foundation of the arts of medicine and pharmacy, and how much we\r\nowe to their patience and diligence, a brief reference may be made\r\nto the class of medicaments in use in the days of Queen Elizabeth,\r\nimmediately prior to the differentiation in England of the first\r\npharmacists—the apothecaries—and the beginnings of pharmacy as a\r\nseparate art.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ITINERANT DRUG SELLER.\r\n\r\nFrom a fifteenth century drawing.]\r\n\r\n“A few simples,” says Burton, “well prepared and understood, are\r\nbetter than such a heap of nonsense, confused compounds, which are in\r\napothecaries’ shops ordinarily sold.”\r\n\r\nFor madness and melancholy, wormwood was used. Another remedy was\r\nclarified whey, with borage, bugloss, endive, succory, etc., a good\r\ndraught of which was taken in the morning, fasting. For the spleen and\r\nliver, syrups were prescribed composed of borage, thyme, epithyme,\r\nhops, scolopendra, fumitory, maiden-hair, and bizantine. These syrups\r\nwere mixed with distilled water by the apothecaries, or stirred into\r\njuleps.\r\n\r\nOf conserves there were innumerable varieties, and ointments of oil\r\nand wax, as well as liniments and plasters of herbs and flowers, well\r\nboiled with oil or spirits.\r\n\r\nCataplasms and salves were frequently made of green herbs sodden,\r\npounded, and applied externally.\r\n\r\nGradually, as the years have rolled on, and as the science of chemistry\r\nhas unlocked the marvellous resources and products of nature, most\r\nof these old relics of the days of superstition and witchcraft have\r\nbeen left behind and forgotten, and it remains only for some old\r\nblack-lettered tome to tell the story and for us to fill in the\r\nbackground to the picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nFAMOUS EMPIRICS AND THEIR NOSTRUMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the eighteenth century, the enterprising empiric\r\nseems to have hit on a new method of lining his pockets at the expense\r\nof the public, and we have the advent of the so-called proprietary\r\nor quack nostrum, which has developed into such gigantic proportions\r\nin later years. To bring some special drug into notoriety in those\r\ndays it was first necessary to spread some tale abroad as to its\r\nextraordinary virtues, then by means of a pamphlet (for there were few\r\nother advertising media) recount the marvellous cures it had performed,\r\nand back them up by mentioning a few great names. In this way the quack\r\nmedicines originated.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, some drugs that have since proved of great use to\r\nhumanity were brought into note. Peruvian bark was first imported into\r\nSpain by the Jesuits, where it remained seven years before a trial was\r\ngiven to it. It was first administered to a Spanish priest in 1639,\r\nand but for the supreme power of the Church of Rome it would in all\r\nprobability have sunk into oblivion. Pope Innocent X., however, at the\r\nintercession of Cardinal de Lugo, ordered the bark to be duly examined\r\nby the best experts of the time, and on a favourable report being\r\npresented, it at once rose high in favour.\r\n\r\nThe “Elixirs of Life” made by the early alchemists may be said to have\r\nbeen the forerunners of quack medicines, and for these concoctions\r\nfabulous prices were demanded. Those made by Paracelsus and Van Helmont\r\nwere known throughout Europe, and must have brought considerable grist\r\nto the mill of their proprietors. The Collyrium of Danares, which\r\nenjoyed a wide reputation in the seventeenth century, was sold at\r\n£9 per bottle. Then there was the Sympathetic Powder of Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, noted for healing wounds, and Hoffman’s Water of Magnanimity.\r\nAnother famous nostrum made by Paracelsus was called _Præcipitatus\r\nDiaphoreticus Paracelsi_, and warranted to cure a fever in four days.\r\n\r\n“Dutch drops,” which were originally sold for half a guinea a bottle,\r\nare said to have brought the proprietors £2000 in one year.\r\n\r\nThe _Eau Médicinale de Husson_, another well-known quack nostrum, was\r\nintroduced by an officer of that name in the service of Louis XVI.\r\nIt is said to have been simply a decoction of meadow saffron. Dr.\r\nJames’ celebrated fever powder, which enjoyed a great reputation in\r\nthis country, is stated to have been the invention of an Italian named\r\nLisle, and a recipe for its preparation was published in Colborne’s\r\n_English Dispensary_ in 1756. Oliver Goldsmith believed this to be a\r\nremedy for all ills and took it regularly up to his death.\r\n\r\nThe Count St. Germain, a Frenchman, realised large sums by vending an\r\nartificial tea, which he affirmed would prolong life. It is said to\r\nhave been composed chiefly of senna and fennel leaves. The Chevalier\r\nd’Ailhoud was another adventurer who introduced a powder which met\r\nwith such a sale that he soon saved enough to buy a whole county. That\r\nprince of empirics the Count Cagliostro sold his Balm of Life, or\r\nstomach elixir, at an exorbitant price. He asserted that he had lived\r\n200 years by its use, and was rendered invulnerable against poison of\r\nevery description.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Strasburg, while boasting and expounding\r\nthe virtues of his nostrum and antidote to a large assembly of the\r\ntownsfolk, a physician who was present, and who had not taken part in\r\nthe conversation, quitting the room quietly, went to an apothecary’s\r\nshop and ordered two pills to be made of equal size. Taking them with\r\nhim, he made his way back to the room, and walking up to the loquacious\r\nquack he said, “Here, my worthy Count, are two pills. The one contains\r\na deadly poison, and the other is perfectly innocent. Choose one and\r\nswallow it, and I will take the one you leave.”\r\n\r\nThe Count took alarm, and after making all kinds of apologies and\r\nexcuses, at last refused to swallow the pill. The physician, smiling,\r\nthen took his place on the platform, and in view of the company\r\nswallowed both, and then, to the discomfort of Cagliostro, announced\r\nthat both pills were simply composed of bread. The Count beat a speedy\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 considerable sensation was excited by the account of some\r\nwonderful cures made by a Count Thün of Leipzig, who professed to cure\r\ngout, hypochondria, and hysteria by laying his hands on the head of the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the present century saw a great increase in the\r\nnumber of these nostrums, the usual method adopted by their proprietors\r\nbeing to set up in great style in a fashionable part of the town,\r\nand by lavish display and various eccentricities, to attract general\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nAmong the foremost in London was a German Jew who called himself\r\nDoctor Brodum. This individual, who, it is said, started life as a\r\nfootman, took a large house in a fashionable square in the west-end,\r\nand drove a pair of horses in a gorgeous chariot. He called his nostrum\r\n“Nervous Cordial,” its properties being set forth in a pamphlet\r\nentitled _A Guide to Old Age_. He is said to have amassed a fortune in\r\na very short time.\r\n\r\nAnother notorious quack was Doctor Solomon, who eventually settled in\r\nLiverpool. He originally sold blacking in Newcastle, but finding it did\r\nnot pay, came to Liverpool, where he tried to establish a newspaper.\r\nThis effort also proved a failure, and Solomon at length turned his\r\nattention to quack doctoring, and brought out a nostrum called “The\r\nBalm of Gilead”. This proved successful, and he soon made enough money\r\nto build himself a substantial house in Kensington, which was at that\r\ntime a fashionable suburban district. To advertise his preparation he\r\nwrote a pamphlet called _The Guide to Health_, extolling the virtues\r\nof the “Balm of Gilead and Anti-Impetigines”. This treatise, the cover\r\nof which was adorned with an engraving of his mansion at Kensington,\r\nstated “the most learned physicians have been unable to discover in the\r\ncordial Balm of Gilead the least particle of mercury, antimony, or any\r\nother mineral except _pure virgin gold_ and the balm of Mecca”.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor was a well-known character in the streets of Liverpool in\r\nthe early part of this century, and in his daily promenade always\r\ncarried an elaborate gold-headed cane. The celebrated “balm” is said to\r\nhave been simply brandy flavoured with some aromatic oil, and although\r\nsold at a guinea a bottle, was in great demand.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a prominent tradesman of the time, who discovered\r\nthat his wife was consuming considerable quantities of the invigorating\r\nbalm. Being further informed that this had become a common habit\r\nwith many of her friends, he took counsel with the husbands of these\r\nladies, with the result that they determined to punish the doctor by\r\ncarrying out the following plot. On a certain dark night, a messenger\r\nwas despatched to the doctor’s house, asking him to come at once and\r\nsee a patient a little way out in the country, and to be sure and bring\r\nwith him several bottles of his Balm of Gilead. The unsuspecting victim\r\nsoon set out on foot along the country lanes, and on getting to a very\r\nlonely part, was pounced upon by four men disguised in cowskins, who,\r\nwith long horns and tails, looked like fiends incarnate. The poor\r\ndoctor thought his last hour had come, and went down on his knees and\r\ninvoked all the prophets he could think of; but his tormentors dragged\r\nhim off to a field close by, where they made him swallow bottle after\r\nbottle of his own nostrum, then ducked him in a pond and tossed him in\r\na blanket.\r\n\r\nSolomon was so incensed at this outrage he determined to leave\r\nLiverpool and settle in Birmingham, but in a short time returned to\r\nthe former city, where he died, and was buried, according to his\r\ndirections, in his own garden.\r\n\r\nThe following verse, referring to these empirics, is extracted from an\r\nold ballad:—\r\n\r\n    “Brodum or Solomon with physic,\r\n    Like death, despatch the wretch that’s sick,\r\n    Pursue a sure and thriving trade;\r\n    Though patients die, the doctor’s paid!\r\n    Licensed to kill, he gains a palace\r\n    For what another mounts a gallows!”\r\n\r\nThe electropathic girdles of our own time had their anti-type in\r\nPerkin’s far-famed tractors for preserving health, for which the\r\nproprietor demanded the sum of five guineas a set. The wonderful\r\nproperties attributed to them were set forth in a small book, entitled\r\n_The Influence of the Metallic Tractors on the Body_.\r\n\r\nAmong the nostrums that enjoyed popularity in the early part of this\r\ncentury were De Velno’s Vegetable Syrup, Dr. Senate’s Lozenges of\r\nSteel to prolong life, Leake’s Patent Pills, Dr. Burton’s Vital\r\nWine, Beddoe’s Volatile Cordial Oxygen Gas for preserving life, Dr.\r\nSquirrel’s Tonic Drops and Powders, Godbold’s Vegetable Balsam, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nThe foibles of many of the most prominent empirics of the period are\r\nwell hit off in the following old ballad:—\r\n\r\n    “We can boast of a Beddoe’s whose oxygen gas\r\n    Can render immortal the ape and the ass;\r\n    While Swainson the botanist, son of Apollo,\r\n    Swears we ne’er shall be sick if his syrup we swallow.\r\n                                            Derry down.\r\n\r\n    “While Solomon flies on the wings of the wind,\r\n    His magical Balm of Mount Gilead to find,\r\n    Little Brodum stands stewing his herbs in a copper,\r\n    And to vend his decoction for gold he thinks proper.\r\n                                            Derry down.\r\n\r\n    “Dull Gardner, destroyer of worms and of men,\r\n    Like Leake, sells his pills to rouse death from his den;\r\n    And Perkins stands brandishing two-pointed tractors,\r\n    To heal the contusions of girls, beaux, and actors.\r\n                                            Derry down.\r\n\r\n    “There’s the lotion of Gowland that flays ladies’ faces,\r\n    Distorting the features of our modern Graces;\r\n    There, Lignum’s dire pills—but of quackery enough!\r\n    Let John Bull take his pipe and contentedly puff.\r\n                                            Derry down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTIQUITY AND HISTORY OF THE MORTAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mortar is the most ancient of pharmaceutical implements, its\r\nearliest use carrying us back to prehistoric times, when the early\r\nBriton bruised his grain in the hollow of a granite boulder. There\r\nis little doubt indeed that mortars were employed for the purpose of\r\nbruising and reducing hard bodies to powder, centuries before medicine\r\nas an art was thought of or known.\r\n\r\nThe name is derived from the Latin word _mortarium_, which is probably\r\nfrom the root _mordeo_, to bite, akin to the Sanscrit _mrid_, to grind\r\nor to pound; the literal meaning of the word being a vessel in which\r\nsubstances may be pounded with a pestle.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the mortar appears to have been identical with that of\r\nthe mill or quern as it was called in ancient times. The primitive\r\nimplement used by prehistoric nations for the purpose of crushing their\r\ngrain, was simply made by hollowing out a cup-shaped hole in a block\r\nof stone or granite, and pounding the grain placed in this receptacle\r\nwith a smaller stone of suitable form. These grain-crushers, together\r\nwith stone rollers and pounders, have been found in the circular huts\r\nof the Britons in several parts of North Wales.\r\n\r\nThis method was also used by the early Jews before the Christian\r\nera for crushing their spices and gums, the knowledge of which they\r\ndoubtless gathered from the Egyptians during the captivity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MORTAR.]\r\n\r\nIn many of the ancient Egyptian papyri we find directions given to\r\nbruise certain herbs and roots, but no mention is made of the implement\r\nused for that purpose; carvings in stone, however, are extant which\r\nshow the mortars used by the Egyptians were similar in form to those\r\nemployed several centuries later.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the mortar has also been known to\r\nseveral Oriental and savage races from time immemorial; and in the\r\nmortar employed by the pharmacist to-day we have an implement that\r\nlinks us not only with prehistoric man, but also with the savage races\r\nof the world. In Africa, mortars and pestles of wood have been used\r\nfrom a period of unknown antiquity for the purpose of crushing grain.\r\nThe one illustrated in Fig. 1 is composed of wood, and was brought from\r\nCentral Africa. In India, stone mortars with wooden pestles have for\r\ncenturies been used for shelling and pounding rice. Fig. 2 represents a\r\nCingalese mortar of stone, from two to three feet in height, taken from\r\na drawing of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nComing to the time of the Roman Empire, we have the first real evidence\r\nof the use of the mortar for pharmaceutical purposes. Medicine and\r\npharmacy allied, in the time of Celsus, had become practical arts; and\r\nwe know from the preparations described by that author that practical\r\nappliances were necessary. Thus the _malagma_ used as an application\r\nto the skin was a kind of soft mass directed to be beaten up to the\r\nconsistency of a thick paste; and the ingredients of the catapotia were\r\noften ordered to be bruised before being mixed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nRoman mortaria composed of earthenware are very commonly found, and\r\nmany examples may be seen in most of our museums among other Roman\r\nremains. They were chiefly made for domestic use, and although they\r\nvary very little in pattern, the sizes are numerous. The larger ones\r\nare, as a rule, very strongly made, and all have a thick divided rim\r\nwith a rounded moulding. The inside was roughened with splinters of\r\nflint or hard stone, or hard-burnt earthenware, which was fixed on\r\nwith a kind of “slip” or liquid clay with which the Romans finished\r\ntheir ware. A wooden pestle was used with these mortaria, which were no\r\ndoubt chiefly employed for triturating and mixing various condiments\r\nfor domestic use. The Roman mortarium shown in Fig. 3 is twenty-eight\r\ninches in breadth, and bears the stamp of the maker’s name, showing it\r\nto be the work of one Publius Raso.\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller mortaria found are composed of a very white clay of\r\na vitreous character burnt hard like porcelain, and are nonabsorbent.\r\nThese were probably used for mixing more delicate condiments.\r\n\r\nThere were large manufactories for mortaria in Britain, situated\r\nchiefly in the south of England, at the mouth of the Thames, and in\r\nEssex and Staffordshire. From these factories there was a considerable\r\nexport trade to Rome and Gaul.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nRoman mortars of stone are much rarer, and the one depicted in Fig. 4\r\nis a unique specimen, and was with little doubt at one time used for\r\npharmaceutical purposes. Composed of stone, with a solid square base,\r\nit stands about twelve inches high, and is about eight inches broad.\r\nThe notches at the corners are evidently intended for fixing it down on\r\na wooden table or slab, to keep it steady when being used for pounding\r\nor breaking up hard substances. Closely akin to mortars were the querns\r\nor small mills used for grinding purposes from the Roman period. In\r\nshape they somewhat resembled the mortar, but were covered in at the\r\ntop, having a hole in the centre through which the pestle was worked.\r\nThey were made of stone and wood. A beautiful example of a wooden quern\r\nis depicted in Fig. 5.[8] It stands thirteen inches high, and is made\r\nof very hard wood. It is an exquisite specimen of the turner’s art,\r\nsome of the side mouldings being of great delicacy, no thicker than a\r\nfine needle, yet perfectly true in every particular. The pestle was\r\nworked through the hole in the centre of the cover. These wooden querns\r\nwere used during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n        [8] Now in the possession of Mr. E. W. Cox, to whom we are\r\n        indebted for the sketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that marble succeeded stone as a material for\r\nmaking mortars, and this brings us down to mediæval times, when the\r\napothecaries, combining the practice of medicine and pharmacy, became\r\nwielders of the pestle.\r\n\r\nThe value of the mortar as a pharmaceutical implement was recognised by\r\nthese early practitioners, and was given the most prominent position\r\nin their shops, and so the pestle and mortar became a symbol or trade\r\nsign of pharmacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe great bell-shaped mortar, which was of considerable capacity,\r\nusually stood, mounted on a solid block of wood, near the centre of the\r\nshop, the huge pestle, three feet or more in length, being suspended\r\nfrom a long wooden spring beam by a chain and ring. One can readily\r\npicture the youthful apprentice, clad in jerkin and trunk hose,\r\nexercising his muscles with the ponderous pestle, and with what mingled\r\nfeelings he would essay the task of pounding half a hundred-weight\r\nof aloes to begin his day’s work and give him an appetite for his\r\nmidday meal. These large mortars were usually bell-shaped in form, as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 6, and composed of iron or bell-metal. The smaller\r\nmortars of this period were made of brass, copper, and bell-metal, and\r\nwere occasionally ornamented with some symbol or device. Many were\r\nvery elegant in form, and they usually stood in bright array on the\r\ncounter. The pestles were made flat, top and bottom, so that either end\r\ncould be used for pounding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe bell-metal mortar depicted in Fig. 7 dates from the time of Oliver\r\nCromwell, and bears the arms of the Commonwealth on both sides. It was\r\nprobably once the property of an official State apothecary. The brass\r\nmortar shown in Fig. 8 is peculiar in shape, and is supported by four\r\nshort legs. It dates from the early part of the seventeenth century,\r\nand round the middle are inscribed the letters of the alphabet. Fig. 9\r\nrepresents a particularly handsome example of the brass mortar of the\r\nseventeenth century. Copper mortars when polished have a very elegant\r\nappearance, and are somewhat rare. A specimen is depicted in Fig. 10.\r\nA very fine bell-shaped mortar of brass was found in Chester about two\r\nyears ago, and is now deposited in the museum of that city. It stands\r\nnearly two feet high, and dates from the early part of the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nSmall brass mortars were also formerly used by housewives in the\r\nstillroom, and for other domestic purposes, and may often yet be found\r\nornamenting the kitchen mantelshelf in old country houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 10.]\r\n\r\nDuring the last and the early part of this century Italian marble was\r\nlargely employed for making mortars, but with the introduction of\r\nwedgewood and composition ware, which is lighter, more durable, and\r\nless liable to be acted on by chemicals, marble mortars have now almost\r\ngone out of use with pharmacists.\r\n\r\nSmall antique mortars of bronze are still to be found in many French\r\npharmacies, often bearing some symbol or device, such as St. Michael\r\nand the dragon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nALCHEMY AND PHARMACY IN LITERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCHAUCER.\r\n\r\n\r\nChaucer’s _Canterbury Tales_ present one of the most interesting\r\npictures of life and manners in the fourteenth century we have in\r\nEnglish literature. The father of English poetry was born in 1328, and\r\nLondon is generally believed to have been his birthplace. It was his\r\nfortune to live under the wing of that chivalrous and high-spirited\r\nking, Edward III., a time when gallantry, prowess, and courage were\r\ncounted in the highest esteem. In his _Canterbury Tales_ he embodies\r\nsome vivid sketches of the times and characters among which he lived.\r\nA physician of course forms one of his motley crew of pilgrims, who\r\nbeguile the monotony of their ride to Canterbury, to pay homage at the\r\nshrine of Thomas à Becket, by the quaint stories related.\r\n\r\nThe pilgrim doctor is thus described:—\r\n\r\n    “With us there was a doctor of physic,\r\n    In all this world there was none him like\r\n    To speak of physic and of surgery,\r\n    For he was grounded in astronomy,\r\n    He kept his patient in a full great deal,\r\n    In houres by his magic natural.\r\n    Well could he fortune the ascendant,\r\n    Of his images for his patient\r\n    He knew the cause of every malady,\r\n    Were it of cold, or hot, or moist, or dry,\r\n    And where engendered and of what humour,\r\n    He was a very perfect practisour.\r\n    The cause-y-know and of his harm the root\r\n    Anon he gave to the sick man his boot.\r\n    Full ready had he his apothecaries,\r\n    To send his drugges and his lectuaries\r\n    For each of them made other for to win\r\n    Their friendship was not newe to begin.\r\n    Well knew he the old Æsculapius,\r\n    And Dioscorides, and eke Rufus,\r\n    Old Hippocras, Hali, and Gallien,\r\n    Serapion, Rasis, and Avicen\r\n    Averrois, Damascene, and Constantin,\r\n    Bernard, and Gatisden, and Gilbertin.\r\n    Of his diet measurable was he,\r\n    For it was of no superfluity,\r\n    But of great nourishing and digestable;\r\n    His study was but little on the Bible,\r\n    In sanguine and in perse he clad was, all\r\n    Lined with taffata and with sendall,\r\n    And yet he was but easy of dispence,\r\n    He kept that he won in the pestilence.\r\n    For gold in physic is a cordial,\r\n    Therefore he loved gold in special.”\r\n\r\nOne can thus picture the ancient physician riding his steady jennet,\r\nclad in doublet and hose of red and blue, with cloak of sendall, a fine\r\nsilk material, all lined with taffata. In telling the stars and casting\r\nhoroscopes he would be learned, as astrology entered very largely into\r\nhis practice, and brought many big fees. So learned a leech would\r\ndoubtless have a large practice, and the apothecaries evidently vied\r\nwith one another in preparing his prescriptions. The names of ancient\r\nphilosophers with whom he was familiar is quite formidable, nearly all\r\nthe old authors being enumerated. It is satisfactory to know he was no\r\nglutton, and had an easy conscience. That he was a wise and careful\r\nman is evident from the fact that when an epidemic came he lived but\r\nmoderately, and saved extra money that flowed in during the plague time.\r\n\r\nThe closing couplet is a pretty bit of wit, and alludes to the frequent\r\nuse of gold in medicine in ancient times.\r\n\r\nAmong the pilgrims also was a cook—\r\n\r\n    “To boil the chickens and the marrow bones,\r\n    And powder marchant tart and garlingale”.\r\n\r\nThe former ingredient, probably a kind of baking powder, is now\r\nunknown, and the use of galingal in cookery has been quite forgotten.\r\nThis aromatic condiment was commonly used as a culinary spice in the\r\nmiddle ages. Reference is made to the drug in the writings of Ibn\r\nKhurdadbah, the Arabian geographer, in the year 869. It was used mixed\r\nwith cloves and cardamoms, and also employed in medical practice as\r\nearly as the ninth century.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the knight’s romantic tale, Palamon, a gallant young\r\nknight, escapes from a prison in which he has been immured for seven\r\nyears, by drugging the jailer:—\r\n\r\n    “Soon after the midnight, Palamon\r\n    By helping of a friend brake his prison\r\n    And fled the city, fast as he might go,\r\n    For he had given drink his gaoler so,\r\n    Of a clary made of a certain wine\r\n    With narcotise and opie of Thebes fine,\r\n    That all the night through that men would him shake,\r\n    The gaoler slept he mighte not wake”.\r\n\r\nClary was Hippocras wine made with spices, probably chosen in order\r\nto mask the taste of the opium and other narcotics, of which it was\r\nevident Palamon must have given the unfortunate jailer a large dose\r\nif he slept through the vigorous shaking which is said to have been\r\nadministered. The opium of Thebes was much used in the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries. Prosper Alpinus, who visited Egypt in 1580-83,\r\nstates that opium or meconium was in his time prepared in the Thebäid\r\nfrom the expressed juice of poppy-heads, and it was called _Opium\r\nThebaïcum_. Later in the story a sharp encounter occurs between two\r\nbands of knights, in which:—\r\n\r\n    “All were they sorely hurt and namely one,\r\n    That with a spear was thirled his breast bone,\r\n    To other wounds and to broken arms,\r\n    Some hadden salves and some hadden charms,\r\n    And pharmacies of herbs eke sage,\r\n    They dranken, for they would their lives have.”\r\n\r\nThe carrying of salves by knights to battle probably originated with\r\nthe Crusaders, who carried, prepared and blessed, unguents to dress\r\ntheir wounds. Other warriors scorned to encumber themselves with the\r\nhealing medicines, and relied on the charm or talisman which almost\r\nevery knight carried on going to war. Some would trust to the simple\r\nherb or decoction, and sage which is here mentioned was supposed to\r\nhave special healing virtue.\r\n\r\nIn the Miller’s tale we are introduced to one Hendy Nicholas, a poor\r\nscholar or tutor who lived at Oxford, and\r\n\r\n    “Had learned art, but all his fantasy\r\n    Was turned for to learn astrology”.\r\n\r\nNicholas was a sly fellow to boot, and somewhat of a beau or a fop of\r\nhis time and evidently having a turn for science, he practised it in\r\nhis leisure, and was consulted by the farmers of the neighbourhood as\r\nto the state of the weather, or in prognosticating the future for their\r\nwives. He had a laboratory at his lodgings, which is described in the\r\nfollowing words:—\r\n\r\n    “A chamber had he in that hostelry,\r\n    Alone withouten any company,\r\n    Full fetisly-y-dight with herbs swoot,\r\n    And he himself was sweet as is the root\r\n    Of liquorice or any setewale.\r\n    His almagest, and books great and small,\r\n    His astrolobe belonging to his art,\r\n    His augrim stones layed fair apart,\r\n    On shelves couched at his beddes head.\r\n    His press-y-covered with a falding red,\r\n    And above all them lay a gay psaltry,\r\n    On which he made at nightes melody\r\n    So sweetely that all the chamber rang,\r\n    And Angelus a virginem he sang;\r\n    And after that he sung the Knight’s note;\r\n    Full often blessed was his merry throat.\r\n    And thus this sweete clerk his time spent,\r\n    After his friendes finding, and his rent.”\r\n\r\nOne can easily imagine from this sketch the astrologer sitting arrayed\r\nin his laboratory, the room filled with the perfume of fragrant herbs,\r\nwith a manner that vied with the sweetness of liquorice or valerian\r\nroot. Prominent among the many books with which he is surrounded\r\nis the _Almagest_, the book of Ptolomy, which formed the canon of\r\nastrological science in the middle ages. In one corner his bed, and\r\nabove on a shelf his astrolobe, with which he told the stars, and the\r\naugrim stones, probably pieces of slate marked with figures used by\r\nastrologers in their art. Then there was the press or chest covered\r\nwith a red cloth, and hanging above it his psaltery gaily decked with\r\nribbons, on which he accompanied himself when he sang, at which he\r\nwas evidently an adept. Later in the story the astrologer and man of\r\nscience becomes smitten by Cupid, and one fine morning goes forth at an\r\nearly hour to serenade a comely maid (unfortunately for him, married)\r\nof whom he is enamoured, and we are told—\r\n\r\n    “When that the first cock hath crowed, anon\r\n    Up rose this jolly lover Absolon,\r\n    And him arrayed gay at point devise,\r\n    But first he chewed grains and liquorice,\r\n    To smelle sweet ere he combed his hair.\r\n    Under his tongue a true love he bear,\r\n    For thereby thought he to be gracious.”\r\n\r\nLike unto other votaries at the shrine of Venus, our astrologer took\r\npains to make himself look to the best advantage, and evidently\r\nbestowed the greatest care on his dress. To perfume his breath and\r\nmake himself acceptable to his lady love, he chewed grains of paradise\r\nand liquorice. The former was a favourite spice in early times, but\r\nnow rarely used. It has a strong aromatic taste, which is imparted\r\nby an essential oil it contains. The “true love” is thought to mean\r\nsome charm or sweetmeat in the form of a “true lover’s knot,” which he\r\nplaced under his tongue for the same purpose, and thus this ancient\r\ngallant went forth to woo.\r\n\r\nThat belladonna was used in Chaucer’s time as a narcotic may be\r\ngathered from a passage in the Reeve’s tale, which runs:—\r\n\r\n    “To bedde went the daughter right anon,\r\n    To bedde went Alein and also John.\r\n    There was no more, needed them no dwale.”\r\n\r\nDwale was an old name for the nightshade, and we may infer its\r\nproperties were known, as it was used to produce sleep at this period.\r\n\r\nIn the Nun’s Priest’s tale we are given a receipt for bad dreams and\r\nmelancholy, which gives an example of the housewife’s knowledge of the\r\nherbs and simples which grew in her garden:—\r\n\r\n    “Through in this town is no apothecary,\r\n    I shall myself two herbes teache you,\r\n    That shall be for your health and for your prow,\r\n    And in our yard the herbs shall I find,\r\n    The which have of their property by kind,\r\n    To purge you beneath and eke above,\r\n    Sire, forget not this for Godde’s love.\r\n    Ye be full coleric of complexion,\r\n    Ware that the sun in his ascension,\r\n    You finde not replete of humours hot,\r\n    And if it do I dare well lay a groat,\r\n    That ye shall have a fever tertiane,\r\n    Or else an ague that may be your bane.\r\n    A day or two ye shall have digestives,\r\n    Of wormes, ere ye take your laxatives\r\n    Of laurel, centaury, and fumetére,\r\n    Or else of elderberry that groweth there,\r\n    Of catapuce, or of the gaitre berries,\r\n    Or herb ivy growing in our yard that merry is.\r\n    Pick them right as they grow and eat them in,\r\n    Be merry husband for your father’s kin.\r\n    Dreade no dream. I can say you no more.”\r\n\r\nThe patient seems threatened with a fever, and the good-wife, after\r\nsome wholesome advice, doses him with digestives for a day or two, and\r\nafterwards with aperients. Laurel would doubtless refer to the leaves\r\nof the cherry laurel, which, infused with wine, was an old digestive\r\ntonic. Centaury, common in our fields, enjoyed a very early reputation.\r\nThe herb was so called because it is said that by its virtue the\r\ncentaur Chiron was healed when the poisoned arrow of Hercules had\r\naccidentally wounded his foot. Fumitory, too, was grown by the\r\nhousewives, and was used as a tonic and a remedy for jaundice.\r\n\r\nThe curative properties of the elder-berry are still recognised as\r\nastringent and sudorific, and take a place in domestic remedies.\r\n\r\nCatapuce is the old name for spurge, a common herb formerly used for\r\nits purgative properties; while the gaitre or dogwood-berries, and the\r\nherb ivy, were also used as laxative medicines and liver stimulants.\r\n\r\nIn the Canon’s Yeoman’s tale we are introduced to a canon who practises\r\nalchemy, and whom Chaucer makes the butt for some keen satire against\r\nthe followers of that science. “It seems,” says Tyrwhitt, “that some\r\nsudden resentment had determined Chaucer to interrupt the regular\r\ncourse of his work in order to insert a satire against the alchemists.\r\nThat their pretended science was much cultivated about this time, and\r\nproduced its usual evils, may fairly be inferred from the Act that was\r\npassed soon after, whereas it was made a felony to multiply gold or\r\nsilver above the art of multiplication.” The description of the canon\r\nas he joined the procession is somewhat amusing:—\r\n\r\n    “His hat hung at his back down by a lace,\r\n    For he had ridden more than trot or pace,\r\n    He hadde pricked like as he were wood.\r\n    A clote leaf he had laid under his hood,\r\n    For sweat and to keep his head from heat,\r\n    But it was joye for to see him sweat.\r\n    His forehead dropped as a stillatory\r\n    Were full of plantain or of paritory.”\r\n\r\nTo keep his head cool while riding hard he had placed a clote or\r\nburdock leaf, which was formerly used as a poultice, in his hat or\r\nhood, a common custom in some parts of the country at the present\r\ntime. To show the tone of the poet’s mind when he wrote this tale,\r\nit may be noted how early the chemical hyperbole is introduced, in\r\ncomparing the canon’s perspiring forehead to a still which is in\r\noperation, filled with plantain, or paritory, an old name for the\r\nwallflower. The former plant had a large, thick, juicy leaf, and was\r\nformerly used as an astringent, while the wallflower once enjoyed a\r\nreputation as an anodyne. The yeoman, in proceeding with the story of\r\nhis master’s practises, first describes his duties as the philosopher’s\r\nman:—\r\n\r\n    “I will speak of our work,\r\n    When we be there as we shall exercise\r\n    Our elvion craft, we seeme wonder wise,\r\n    Our termes be so clergial and quaint,\r\n    I blow the fire till that mine hearte faint.\r\n    Why should I tellen each proportion\r\n    Of things whiche that we work upon,\r\n    As on five or six ounces may well be\r\n    Of silver, or some other quantity?\r\n    And busy me to tell you the names,\r\n    As orpiment, burnt bones, iron squames,\r\n    That into powder grounden be full small,\r\n    And in an earthen pot how put is all.”\r\n\r\nThe poet here describes an old amalgam used in alchemy composed of red\r\nlead, bone ash, and iron scales:—\r\n\r\n    “Of the care and woe\r\n    That we had in our matters subliming,\r\n    And in amalgaming, and calcining\r\n    Of quicksilver, called mercury crude,\r\n    For all our sleightes we can not conclude”.\r\n\r\nThe subliming of mercury was considered a most important process, and\r\nwas performed with much care.\r\n\r\nThe yeoman then goes on to enumerate other articles and apparatus used\r\nby the craft, in a somewhat disjointed manner:—\r\n\r\n    “Yet I will tell them as they come to mind,\r\n    As bol armoniac, verdigris, borace,\r\n    And sundry vessels made of earth and glass,\r\n    Our urinals, and our descensories;\r\n    Phials, and croslets, and sublimatories,\r\n    Cucurbites and alembikes eke,\r\n    And other suche dear enough a leek”.\r\n\r\nThe descensorie was a kind of flask used in distilling _per descensum_,\r\nwhile the croslet was an old name for the crucible. The cucurbite was\r\nthe retort used in distilling, and the alembike was the still itself.\r\n\r\nThe yeoman then continues:—\r\n\r\n    “Waters rubifying and bulle’s gall,\r\n    Arsenic, sal-ammoniac, and brimstone,\r\n    And herbs could I tell eke many a one,\r\n    As egremonie, valerian, and lunary;\r\n    And other such if that me list to tarry,\r\n    Our lampes burning both night and day,\r\n    To bring about our craft if that we may,\r\n    Our furnace eke of calcination,\r\n    And of waters albification”.\r\n\r\nEgremonoine or agrimony, commonly called liverwort, was used in\r\nearly medical practice as an astringent tonic, lunary or moonwort\r\n(_Botrychium Lunaria_) being possessed of similar medicinal\r\nproperties:—\r\n\r\n    “Clay made with horse and mannes hair, and oil\r\n    Of tartar. Alum, glass, barm, wort, and argoil,\r\n    Rosalgar and other matters imbibing,\r\n    And eke of our matters encorporing;\r\n    And of our silver citrination,\r\n    Our cementing and fermentation,\r\n    Our ingots, tests, and many things mo’.”\r\n\r\nAmong the other strange articles named, argoil was the potters’ clay\r\nused as a luting to close the joints, seal the flasks, and exclude\r\nthe air. Rosalgar was the ancient name for flowers of antimony, much\r\nesteemed by the philosophers. The term citrination refers to the yellow\r\ncolour, which, when it occurred through chemical action, proved the\r\nphilosopher’s stone.\r\n\r\nWe next have the alchemist’s creed, and the fundamental principles of\r\nthe old philosophy:—\r\n\r\n    “I will tell you as was one taught also,\r\n    The foure spirits and the bodies seven.\r\n    By order as oft I heard my lord them neven,\r\n    The first spirit quicksilver called is;\r\n    The second orpiment, the third y-wis\r\n    Sal-ammoniac, and the fourth brimstone,\r\n    The bodies sion eke lo them here anon;\r\n    Sol gold is, and Luna silver was threpe,\r\n    Mars iron, Mercury quicksilver, we clepe.\r\n    Saturnus is lead, and Jupiter is tin,\r\n    And Venus copper by my father’s kin.”\r\n\r\nThe metallic bodies were described in the works of alchemists by\r\nthe planet under whose influence they were supposed to operate, and\r\nknown by the alchemical symbol of that planet. Thus gold is called\r\nSol, represented by the symbol ☉, and copper is termed\r\nVenus, represented by the symbol ♀. It appears to have been\r\na custom of the apothecaries from very early times to fill bottles\r\nwith coloured solutions which were marked with these symbols; thus, a\r\nbottle containing a yellow solution signifying gold would be marked\r\n☉, and a red one would be marked ♂, signifying iron.\r\nThese gradually became a kind of trade sign, and are probably the\r\norigin of the coloured globes used as the insignia of the pharmacist or\r\ncompounder of medicines at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nSHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bard of Avon, in the wide and general knowledge he displays of\r\nthe manners, ways, and customs of his own and other countries in his\r\nplays, makes many allusions to drugs and herbs, and their use. In his\r\nreferences to drugs, there is none perhaps on which greater difference\r\nof opinion exists than that alluded to in the speech of the Ghost in\r\n_Hamlet_, in which the apparition says:—\r\n\r\n    “Sleeping within mine orchard,\r\n    My custom always in the afternoon,\r\n    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\r\n    With juice of cursèd hebenon in a vial,\r\n    And in the porches of mine ear did pour\r\n    The leprous distilment; whose effect\r\n    Holds such an enmity with blood of man,\r\n    That, swift as quicksilver, it courses through\r\n    The natural gates and alleys of the body;\r\n    And, with a sudden vigour, it doth posset\r\n    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,\r\n    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine”.[9]\r\n\r\n        [9] _Hamlet_, act i., scene v.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a matter of individual speculation and dispute\r\nas to the juice of what plant Shakespeare alludes to here as the\r\n“cursed hebenon”. The meaning of the word hebenon is ebony-coloured,\r\nor black, so that it might apply to any dark liquid. Most writers and\r\ncommentators seem to be of opinion that henbane is alluded to, but\r\njudging from the rapid effect of the liquid, it would appear that\r\nsome more powerful poison is intended. The juice of henbane is not a\r\npowerful poison, and it is but a feeble narcotic whose effects are\r\nmainly sedative and soothing. It acts also as a neurotic, affecting\r\nthe brain and producing delirium. It will be seen that there is little\r\nsimilitude between the actual effect of henbane and that of the poison\r\ndescribed by the poet. Others think it more probable that hemlock,\r\nan ancient poison of the Greeks, is intended. Its action is much\r\nmore rapid and powerful, the spinal cord being chiefly affected, and\r\nparalysis caused, ending in death. The drug is a powerful narcotic\r\nand anodyne, and is also a paralysant. It was well known to the\r\napothecaries of Shakespeare’s day, its poisonous properties having been\r\nobserved from very early times. It should be taken into account, that\r\nas a matter of fact the pouring of any poisonous liquid of vegetable\r\norigin into the ear would have little or no immediate effect; and\r\nunless the tympanum had been ruptured it would be almost impossible\r\nfor it to be absorbed into the system and at once prove fatal.\r\n\r\nParis says: “Might not the juice of cursed hebenon by which, according\r\nto Shakespeare, the King of Denmark was poisoned, have been the\r\nessential oil of tobacco?” In the first place, the learned commentator\r\nDr. Grey observes, that the word here used—hebenon—was more probably\r\ndesignated by a metathesis, either of the poet or transcriber, for\r\nhenebon, _i.e._, henbane. Now, it appears from Gerade, the “tobaco”\r\nwas commonly called henbane of Peru—_Hyoscyamus Peruvianus_; and when\r\nwe consider how high the public prejudice ran against this herb in the\r\nreign of James, it seems not unlikely that Shakespeare should have\r\nselected it as an agent of extraordinary malignity. No preparation\r\nof _hyoscyamus_ with which we are acquainted would produce death by\r\napplication to the ear, whereas the essential oil of tobacco might\r\npossibly have such an effect.\r\n\r\nThe term “distilment,” says Stevens, “is calculated to support this\r\nconjecture. Surely the expression signifies that the preparation was\r\nthe result of a distillation.” It is a singular fact that the essential\r\noil of tobacco differs considerably in its physiological action from\r\nan infusion made from the leaves, the former affecting the brain, and\r\nthe latter the heart.[10]\r\n\r\n        [10] Paris, _Pharmacologia_, p. 294.\r\n\r\nEllacombe states: “Before, and in the time of Shakespeare, other\r\nwriters had spoken of the narcotic and poisonous effects of heben,\r\nhebenon, or hebona.”\r\n\r\nSpenser says:—\r\n\r\n    “Faire Venus sonne,...\r\n    Lay now thy deadly heben bow apart”.\r\n\r\nGower and Marlowe also wrote of the juice of hebon. It may be taken for\r\ngranted that all these authors allude to the same tree.\r\n\r\nNicholson and Harrison, after a very exhaustive investigation of the\r\nsubject, agree that the true reading is hebona, and that hebona is the\r\nyew. Their main arguments are based on the following three facts:—\r\n\r\n1. That in nearly all the northern nations the name of the yew is more\r\nor less like heben.\r\n\r\n2. That all the effects attributed by Shakespeare to the action of\r\nhebona are described by different medical writers as arising from yew\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n3. That the _post-mortem_ appearances after yew poisoning and snake\r\npoisoning are similar.\r\n\r\nLater on, in the play performed before the King, Lucianus thus speaks\r\nof the poisonous medicine he uses:—\r\n\r\n    “Thoughts break, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,\r\n    Confederate season, else no creature seeing,\r\n    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\r\n    With Hecate’s ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\r\n    Thy natural magic and dire property\r\n    On wholesome life usurp immediately”.\r\n\r\nHere allusion is made to a mixture of poisonous herbs gathered at\r\nmidnight, probably hemlock among others, as mentioned in the witches’\r\nincantation in _Macbeth_, to which we shall refer later. With regard\r\nto the gathering of herbs at night, the practice was common, it being\r\nsupposed that the properties of the plant collected at night were\r\nstronger than in the daytime. That there is a certain amount of truth\r\nin this is proved by the researches of Sachs and Brown, who have found\r\nfrom their investigations that starch is formed in the leaves of plants\r\nduring the day, and is consumed during the night, so that the old\r\nsuperstition of the increased activity of the midnight gathered herb\r\nwas not mythical.\r\n\r\nShakespeare’s well-known description of the poor apothecary of his\r\ntime, which he introduces in _Romeo and Juliet_, presents an excellent\r\npicture of the needy practitioner in the sixteenth century:—\r\n\r\n    “I do remember an apothecary,\r\n    And hereabouts he dwells, whom late I noted\r\n    In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,\r\n    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,\r\n    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:\r\n    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\r\n    An alligator stuff’d, and other skins\r\n    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\r\n    A beggarly account of empty boxes,\r\n    Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds;\r\n    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,\r\n    Were thinly scattered to make up a show”.[11]\r\n\r\n        [11] _Romeo and Juliet_, act v., scene i.\r\n\r\nOne can readily picture the poverty-stricken appearance of the dark\r\nlittle shop, littered and crowded with the stuffed skins of curious\r\nfishes and alligators. One can almost smell the close musty odour\r\nblended with the aromatic perfume of drugs and the old cakes of pressed\r\nrose leaves, the manner in which they were formerly preserved for\r\nmedicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nThe fashionably-dressed Romeo enters, after having made a considerable\r\nnoise to rouse the attention of the old apothecary from his perchance\r\nmuch-needed repose, and offers his bribe for the poison. Of the purpose\r\nfor which he requires it he makes little secret.\r\n\r\n    “ROMEO. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor;\r\n            Hold, there is forty ducats; let me have\r\n            A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\r\n            As will disperse itself through all the veins,\r\n            That the life-weary taker may fall dead;\r\n            And that the trunk may be discharged of breath\r\n            As violently as hasty powder fir’d\r\n            Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s mouth.”\r\n\r\nThe Apothecary’s reply:—\r\n\r\n    “Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua’s law\r\n    Is death to any he that utters them,”\r\n\r\nwould show that Shakspeare’s idea of the law respecting the sale of\r\npoisons was a severe one, and much before his time. The law in England\r\nat that time as regards the selling of poisons was very lax. But for\r\nthe poor apothecary the bribe was too tempting. Perchance he was\r\nhungry, and there is something pathetic in his rejoinder,\r\n\r\n    “My poverty, but not my will, consents”.\r\n\r\nAnd giving Romeo the poison:—\r\n\r\n    “Put this in any liquid thing you will,\r\n    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength\r\n    Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight”.\r\n\r\nThe poet gives no indication of the nature of the poison beyond that\r\nits effect was very rapid, as when the distracted lover drinks to his\r\nlady love in the deadly draught he exclaims:—\r\n\r\n    “O true apothecary!\r\n    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.”\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the sixteenth century the practice of the black\r\nart was carried on throughout England, mostly by old women, who\r\nalso sold charms and love philtres. Shakespeare’s description of the\r\nwitches’ incantations in _Macbeth_ presents some idea of a seance, and\r\nthe gruesome articles in which they dealt. To know the properties of\r\nthe most poisonous herbs (often quite fictitious) was part of their\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n    “Round about the cauldron go;\r\n    In the poison’d entrails throw.\r\n    Toad, that under coldest stone,\r\n    Days and nights hast thirty-one\r\n    Swelter’d venom sleeping got,\r\n    Boil thou first i’ the charmed pot.\r\n        Double, double, toil and trouble;\r\n        Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\r\n    “Fillet of a fenny snake,\r\n    In the cauldron boil and bake;\r\n    Eye of newt and toe of frog,\r\n    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,\r\n    Adder’s fork, and blind-worm’s sting,\r\n    Lizard’s leg, and owlet’s wing,\r\n    For a charm of powerful trouble;\r\n    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.\r\n        Double, double, toil and trouble;\r\n        Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.\r\n    “Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,\r\n    Witch’s mummy, maw and gulf\r\n    Of the ravin’d salt-sea shark;\r\n    Root of hemlock, digg’d i’ the dark,\r\n    Liver of blaspheming Jew;\r\n    Gall of goat, and slips of yew,\r\n    Sliver’d in the moon’s eclipse;\r\n    Nose of Turk and Tartar’s lips;\r\n    Finger of birth-strangled babe,\r\n    Ditch-delivered by a drab,\r\n    Make the gruel thick and slab;\r\n    Add thereto a tiger’s chaudron,\r\n    For the ingredients of our cauldron.\r\n        Double, double, toil and trouble;\r\n        Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.”\r\n\r\nThe method here used by the witches to measure the time that the\r\ncauldron should boil by singing their incantation is, according to Dr.\r\nLauder Brunton, an ancient mode of calculating time still used in some\r\nparts of the country at the present day. By thus repeating several\r\nverses they could regulate the time of boiling fairly well. The old\r\napothecaries used the moon as a method of calculating the time certain\r\nprocesses should take, and the word “menstruum,” still commonly used,\r\nwas employed because certain drugs were allowed to macerate a month in\r\nthe liquid to extract the active constituents.\r\n\r\nIn the toad that had been lying under a stone for thirty-one days\r\nand nights, we have another curious instance how the empirical\r\npractitioners of mediæval times acted on a certain traditional\r\nknowledge, which modern science has since proved to be correct.\r\n\r\nWe have again in the toad which has lain dormant for a month, the idea\r\nthat it was the best time for his use, when his venom would be most\r\nactive, besides the advantage also of catching him napping, when he\r\nwould have no opportunity of getting rid of the poisonous principle\r\ncontained in his skin. Dr. Lauder Brunton remarks with respect to this\r\npractice: “I remember reading as a child a story of how King John was\r\npoisoned by a friar who dropped a toad into his wine, but some books\r\nof natural history forty or fifty years ago scouted the idea of toads\r\nbeing poisonous at all. A little while ago, however, Dr. Leonard Guthie\r\nsent me an interesting account of a wicked Italian woman whose husband\r\nwas dying of dropsy. He took so long about it that his wife became\r\ntired of the process, and thought that she would help him on. She\r\naccordingly caught a toad and put it in his wine, so that he should\r\ndrink the liquid and die, but instead of dying he, to her astonishment\r\nand disgust, completely recovered. Forty years ago this story would\r\nhave been scouted as equally mythical with that of King John, but now\r\nwe know that it is precisely what the woman would have expected if she\r\nhad only been acquainted with the researches of modern pharmacology.\r\nFor the skin of a toad secretes a poison, the active principle of\r\nwhich, phrynin, has an action very much resembling that of digitalis,\r\nwhich is the remedy _par excellence_ for dropsy depending on heart\r\ndisease.”\r\n\r\nNot less curious are the directions for gathering the poisonous\r\nhemlock at night, which has recently been shown to be the time of\r\nits greatest activity. These few instances show that the ancient\r\napothecaries had often much greater knowledge than we give them credit\r\nfor, and that some of the modern discoveries in modern science were\r\nwell known to them, even if they could not account for them.\r\n\r\nIn the _Taming of the Shrew_ allusion is made to the simples in vogue\r\nat the time for hurts and bruises. The lord’s directions for the\r\ntreatment of Christopher Sly, who is found sleeping in the road on a\r\ncold night after a drinking bout, are curious:—\r\n\r\n    “Balm his foul head with warm distilled waters,\r\n    And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet”.\r\n\r\nThe distilled aromatic waters, of which the apothecary manufactured a\r\nconsiderable number, were much used in the middle ages for the purpose\r\nof fomentation. The burning of sweet woods, such as aloe or sandal, to\r\ntake away evil smells, was a very ancient practice.\r\n\r\nAn old cure for melancholy is embodied in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n    “Your honour’s players, hearing your amendment,\r\n    Are come to play a pleasant comedy,\r\n    For so your doctors hold it very meet:\r\n    Seeing too much sadness hath congeal’d your blood,\r\n    And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy,\r\n    Therefore they thought it good you hear a play,\r\n    And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,\r\n    Which bars a thousand harms, and lengthens life”.\r\n\r\nIn _Measure for Measure_, the poet had evidently the dulcamara or\r\nbitter-sweet in mind when he penned the lines:—\r\n\r\n    “I should not think it strange, for ’tis a physic\r\n    That’s bitter to sweet end”.\r\n\r\nThe dulcamara or bitter-sweet has the peculiar property, when first\r\ntaken into the mouth, of imparting a bitter flavour which gradually\r\nchanges to a sweet one, hence its name.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge of drugs and herbs possessed by the noble dames and\r\nhousewives is frequently mentioned by Shakespeare. The chatelaine of\r\nhis time was well acquainted with the medicinal properties of all the\r\nsimples and herbs, which she cultivated in her own garden. Her skill\r\nand experience were always at the service of her household and of\r\ndependants for miles around.\r\n\r\nThe Queen, wife of Cymbeline, gives evidence of this in her\r\nconversation with Cornelius the physician:—\r\n\r\n        “QUEEN. Whiles yet the dew’s on ground, gather those flowers;\r\n                Make haste: who has the note of them?\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?\r\n\r\n    “CORNELIUS. Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam\r\n                    (_presenting a small box_),\r\n                But I beseech your grace, without offence—\r\n                My conscience bids me ask—wherefore you have\r\n                Commanded of me these most poisonous compounds,\r\n                Which are the movers of a languishing death;\r\n                But, though slow, deadly?\r\n\r\n        “QUEEN. I do wonder, doctor,\r\n                Thou ask’st me such a question. Have I not been\r\n                Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learned me how\r\n                To make perfumes, distil, preserve? yea, so,\r\n                That our great king himself doth woo me oft\r\n                For my confections? Having thus far proceeded\r\n                (Unless thou think’st me devilish), is’t not meet\r\n                That I did amplify my judgment in\r\n                Other conclusions? I will try the forces\r\n                Of these thy compounds on such creatures as\r\n                We count not worth the hanging, but none human,\r\n                To try the vigour of them, and apply\r\n                Allayments to their act, and by them gather\r\n                Their several virtues, and effects.\r\n\r\n    “CORNELIUS. Your highness\r\n                Shall from this practice but make hard your heart:\r\n                Besides, the seeing these effects will be\r\n                Both noisome and infectious.\r\n\r\n        “QUEEN. Oh content thee.\r\n\r\n                    _Enter_ PISANIO.\r\n\r\n      (_aside_) Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him\r\n                Will I first work: he’s for his master,\r\n                And enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio?\r\n                Doctor, your service for this time is ended;\r\n                Take your own way.\r\n\r\n    “CORNELIUS. (_aside_) I do suspect you, madam,\r\n                But you shall do no harm.\r\n                I do not like her. She doth think she has\r\n                Strange lingering poisons. I do not know her spirit,\r\n                And will not trust one of her malice with\r\n                A drug of such damn’d nature. Those she has\r\n                Will stupify and dull the sense a while:\r\n                Which first, perchance, she’ll prove on cats and dogs,\r\n                Then afterwards up higher, but there is\r\n                No danger in what show of death it makes,\r\n                More than the locking up the spirits a time\r\n                To be more fresh reviving. She is fool’d\r\n                With a most false effect; and I the truer\r\n                So to be false with her.”[12]\r\n\r\n        [12] _Cymbeline_, scene vi.\r\n\r\nThe caution of the physician is well described, and his resort to\r\nsubterfuge in order to checkmate the evil design of his wily mistress\r\nand old pupil, whom he evidently distrusts.\r\n\r\nThe Queen is supposed to have possessed considerable knowledge and\r\nskill in the use of drugs, and her conserves had evidently a great\r\nreputation. Her scientific ideas were in advance of the age she lived\r\nin when she states her desire to make physiological experiments on\r\nanimals to advance her knowledge; but the clear acumen of Cornelius saw\r\nthrough the apparently laudable spirit of research that imbued his\r\npupil, and he supplied her with drugs of less potency.\r\n\r\nThe following allusions are made to the apothecary:—\r\n\r\n    “CARDINAL BEAUFORT. Bid the apothecary\r\n        Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.”[13]\r\n\r\nAnd again, in _Pericles, Prince of Tyre_, Cerimon says:—\r\n\r\n    “Your master will be dead ere you return;\r\n    There’s nothing can be minister’d to nature,\r\n    That can recover him. Give this to the apothecary,\r\n    And tell me how it works.”[14]\r\n\r\n        [13] _Henry VI._, part iii., act ii., scene iii.\r\n\r\n        [14] _Pericles_, act iii., scene ii.\r\n\r\nThis lord of Ephesus was evidently something of an amateur physician,\r\nas he tells us later that\r\n\r\n                      “’Tis known I ever\r\n    Have studied physic, through which secret art,\r\n    By turning o’er authorities, I have\r\n    (Together with my practice) made familiar\r\n    To me and to my aid the blest infusions\r\n    That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;\r\n    And can speak of the disturbances that nature\r\n    Works, and of the cures; which doth give me\r\n    A more content in course of true delight\r\n    Than to be thirsty after tottering honour”.\r\n\r\nThe lines—\r\n\r\n    “One whose subdu’d eyes,\r\n    Albeit unused to the melting mood,\r\n    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees\r\n    Their medicinal gum,”[15]\r\n\r\nspoken by Othello, refer to the manner in which many of the medicinal\r\ngums are collected in the East. Small slits or punctures are made in\r\nthe bark of the tree, through which the semi-liquid gum slowly oozes.\r\nIt then coagulates in the form of a tear, and is at length scraped off\r\nand collected.\r\n\r\n        [15] _Othello_, act v., scene ii.\r\n\r\n    “Set ratsbane by his porridge.”[16]\r\n\r\n        [16] _King Lear_, act iii., scene iv.\r\n\r\n    “I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to\r\n        stop it with security.”[17]\r\n\r\n        [17] _Henry IV._, part ii., act i., scene ii.\r\n\r\n    “I would the milk\r\n    Thy mother gave thee, when thou suck’dst her breast,\r\n    Had been a little ratsbane for my sake.”[18]\r\n\r\n        [18] _Henry VI._, act v., scene iv.\r\n\r\nRatsbane, mentioned in the three preceding quotations, was an old\r\nname for arsenic, which in Shakespeare’s time was commonly used for\r\npoisoning rats, hence the name.\r\n\r\n    “I have bought the oil, the balsamum, and aqua vitæ,”[19]\r\n\r\nsays Dromio of Syracuse. These were the medical comforts for the barque\r\nof Epidamnum, and show that sailing vessels in those days carried a\r\ncertain amount of medicine. The oil may have been one of the many\r\npanaceas of the time for “purging the body of bile or humour,” while\r\nbalsams there were by the score, of Hungary, and aromatics for “wind\r\nand pain”. The _aqua vitæ_ alluded to was probably brandy, which would\r\nserve to keep the courage of the voyagers up and the cold out.\r\n\r\n        [19] _Comedy of Errors_, act iv., scene i.\r\n\r\nProteus, in the _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, exclaims:—\r\n\r\n    “When I was sick you gave me bitter pills;\r\n    And I must minister like to you”.[20]\r\n\r\n        [20] _Two Gentlemen of Verona_, act ii., scene iv.\r\n\r\nIn _Lucrece_ the bard shows he knew something of the counteracting\r\neffects of certain drugs from the following lines:—\r\n\r\n    “The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted\r\n    In a pure compound; being so applied,\r\n    His venom in effect is purified”.[21]\r\n\r\n        [21] _Lucrece_, v., 76.\r\n\r\n    “KING HENRY. The united vessel of their blood,\r\n                 Mingled with venom of suggestion,\r\n                 As, for a purpose, the age will pour it in,\r\n                 Shall never leak, though it do work as strong\r\n                 As aconitum or rash gunpowder.”[22]\r\n\r\n        [22] _King Henry IV._, part ii., act iv., scene iv.\r\n\r\nThe aconite or monkshood, formerly called wolf’s bane, gives us one\r\nof the most powerful vegetable poisons, its properties having long\r\nbeen known and employed in medical practice. It was used by the early\r\nGreeks and Romans, and is probably even of still greater antiquity.\r\nOn account of its rapid and deadly action, Shakespeare compares it to\r\ngunpowder. Some commentators are of the opinion that aconite was the\r\npoison sold by the apothecary to the lovesick Romeo.\r\n\r\nA curious old tradition is alluded to by Falstaff when speaking of the\r\nchamomile, in the following sentence:—\r\n\r\n  “Though the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster it\r\n  grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the sooner it wears”.[23]\r\n\r\n        [23] _King Henry IV._, part i., act ii., scene iv.\r\n\r\nThe chamomile has an ancient reputation for its medicinal properties as\r\na stomachic and febrifuge.\r\n\r\nIts growth is said to be improved by being pressed or trampled into the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n  “SHALLOW. Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour, we\r\n  will eat a last year’s pippin of my own graffing, with a dish of\r\n  caraways and so forth.”[24]\r\n\r\n        [24] _King Henry IV._, part ii., act v., scene iii.\r\n\r\nCarraway seeds were very largely used in Shakespeare’s time as a spice\r\nand condiment. The essential oil they yield has carminative properties.\r\nThe seeds were often served with roast apples, a custom still said to\r\nbe kept up at Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n  “IAGO. The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be\r\n  to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida.”[25]\r\n\r\nThe coloquintida mentioned, is the old name for colocynth, a drug\r\nlargely used in medicine at the present time. It was employed by the\r\nGreek and Roman physicians as a purgative, and was known in Britain as\r\nearly as the eleventh century. It has a drastic, bitter taste, and is\r\ncommonly known as bitter apple.\r\n\r\n        [25] _Othello_, act i., scene iii.\r\n\r\nShakespeare makes several allusions to the elder, a tree concerning\r\nwhich there are many old traditions. One of them will suffice.\r\n\r\n    “HOLOFERNES. Begin, sir, you are my elder.\r\n\r\n         “BIRON. Well followed; Judas was hanged on an elder.”[26]\r\n\r\n        [26] _Love’s Labour’s Lost_, act v., scene ii.\r\n\r\nThe _sambucus nigra_, or black elder, has long been used in medicine as\r\na discutient, yet tradition gives it an evil name. Judas was supposed\r\nto have hanged himself on an elder tree, which doubtless brought it\r\ninto disrepute, although its flowers distilled with water make an\r\nexcellent cosmetic.\r\n\r\n    “OPHELIA. There’s fennel for you and columbines.”[27]\r\n\r\n        [27] _Hamlet_, act iv., scene v.\r\n\r\nThis herb was greatly valued by the old apothecaries, and was known\r\nalso to the ancients. There was an old belief that the fennel in flower\r\npredicted an early summer. Its chief use now is as a flavouring agent.\r\n\r\nSeveral allusions are also made to ginger.\r\n\r\n  “CLOWN. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies; mace;\r\n  dates—none, that’s out of my note; nutmegs, seven; a race or two\r\n  of ginger, but that I beg.”[28]\r\n\r\nGinger was known and used by the Greeks and Romans as a spice, and was\r\nesteemed by physicians in England at the time of the Norman Conquest.\r\nIts hot, burning taste is due to a resinous principle contained in the\r\nroot, and is still used in medicine.\r\n\r\n        [28] _Winter’s Tale_, act iv., scene iii.\r\n\r\nThe mandrake or mandragora is frequently mentioned in the plays. Thus\r\nsays\r\n\r\n    “IAGO. Not poppy, nor mandragora,\r\n           Nor all the drowsy syrup of the world,\r\n           Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep\r\n           Which thou owedst yesterday.”[29]\r\n\r\nAlso—\r\n\r\n    “JULIET. And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\r\n             That living mortals, hearing them, run mad,”[30]\r\n\r\nalluding to the old tradition that the mandrake groaned when pulled\r\nup by the roots, and the person who did it would surely die soon.\r\nThe mandragora, to which wonderful properties were ascribed by the\r\nancients, is not now used in medicine.\r\n\r\n        [29] _Othello_, act iii., scene iii.\r\n\r\n        [30] _Romeo and Juliet_, act iv., scene iii.\r\n\r\n  “LAFEU. Go to, sir, you were beaten in Italy for picking a kernel\r\n            out of a pomegranate.”[31]\r\n\r\n        [31] _All’s Well that Ends Well_, act ii., scene iii.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal properties of the pomegranate have been known from very\r\nancient times, frequent mention of it being made in the Bible. A\r\ndecoction of the root is recommended by Celsus, Dioscorides, and Pliny\r\nfor tapeworm; and it is still used as an astringent.\r\n\r\nThe poppy is mentioned by Iago in the quotation previously given, as\r\nbeing known for its narcotic properties.\r\n\r\n    “MACBETH. What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug\r\n              Would scour these English hence?”[32]\r\n\r\n        [32] _Macbeth_, act v., scene iii.\r\n\r\nRhubarb was known to the Chinese 2700 B.C., and has been used for its\r\npurgative properties from the earliest times. It is said to take its\r\nname from the river Rhu, now the Volga, on whose banks it grows.\r\n\r\n    “PERDITA. For you there’s rosemary and rue; these keep\r\n              Seeming and savour all the winter long;\r\n              Grace and remembrance be to you both.”[33]\r\n\r\n        [33] _Winter’s Tale_, act iv., scene iv.\r\n\r\nRosemary has been esteemed for centuries for its refreshing and\r\naromatic perfume, due to the essential oil it contains, and which even\r\nnow has a reputation as an application for the hair. It is mentioned by\r\nPliny, and has been cultivated in Britain since the time of the Norman\r\nConquest. On account of its evergreen leaves it was considered an\r\nemblem of constancy, and was frequently carried at wedding and funeral\r\nceremonies. It was customary in France at one time, to place a bunch of\r\nrosemary in the hands of the dead. The old apothecaries had great faith\r\nin the oil as an embrocation, and it was largely used to place among\r\nclothes as a preventive of moths.\r\n\r\n  “OPHELIA. There’s rue for you; and here’s some for me: we may call\r\n              it herb grace o’ Sundays: O, you must wear your rue\r\n              with a difference.”[34]\r\n\r\n        [34] _Hamlet_, act iv., scene v.\r\n\r\nSome curious traditions are attached to rue, or, as it was formerly\r\ncalled, the herb of grace, probably on account of its being often worn\r\nas an amulet to ward off disease, and also used by the old Romanists in\r\nthe exorcisms. It has ever been regarded as a symbol of sorrow or pity,\r\nas its name implies. The word is probably derived from the same root\r\nas Ruth, meaning sorrow and remorse, while “to rue” was to be sorry for.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times it was supposed to be useful for almost every disease,\r\nits properties being due to an essential oil still used in pharmacy.\r\n\r\nIt was largely employed in affections of the eye and for its antiseptic\r\nproperties as a preservative to ward off decay.\r\n\r\nThe plant is not a native of England, but has been cultivated in this\r\ncountry for more than 800 years, and was extensively grown in the old\r\nherb gardens.\r\n\r\nEuphrasie and rue were often used together as a curative application\r\nfor the eyes. In _Paradise Lost_ Milton says:—\r\n\r\n    “Then purged with euphrasie and rue\r\n    The visual nerve, for he has much to see”.\r\n\r\nRue was employed also to take away warts, the freshly cut stem being\r\nrubbed over the excrescence, and the following couplet repeated:—\r\n\r\n    “Ashen true, ashen tree,\r\n    Pray bury these warts of me”.\r\n\r\nAnother old rhyme runs:—\r\n\r\n    “What savour is better, if physicke be true\r\n    For places infected than wormwood or rue”.\r\n\r\n    “CLOWN. I must have saffron to colour the warden pies.”[35]\r\n\r\n        [35] _Winter’s Tale_, act iv., scene iii.\r\n\r\nSaffron was formerly much prized as a medicine, a condiment, and a\r\ndye. It is said to have been introduced into England in the reign of\r\nEdward III., and was cultivated in the neighbourhood of Walden, in\r\nEssex, to which it gave its name. The quality of English saffron was\r\nrenowned in Shakspeare’s time. It was used by the monks in mediæval\r\ndays in illuminating their missals, and dyeing materials, as well as\r\nbeing esteemed as a febrifuge and cordial.\r\n\r\n    “MACBETH. What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug\r\n              Would scour these English hence?”[36]\r\n\r\n        [36] _Macbeth_, act v., scene iii.\r\n\r\nThe well-known purgative properties of senna leaves were held in great\r\nrepute by the old apothecaries. The drug was introduced into Europe\r\nabout the ninth or tenth century by the Arabs, and it soon attained a\r\nreputable position in medical practice. The best variety was originally\r\nsupposed to have been brought from Mecca.\r\n\r\n    “ROSALINE. To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain.”[37]\r\n\r\n        [37] _Love’s Labour’s Lost_, act v., scene ii.\r\n\r\nWormwood has always had a high reputation as a medicine, and was\r\nchiefly used as a tonic. It yields an essential oil with an extremely\r\nbitter taste, which is yet largely used in France in the manufacture\r\nof absinthe.\r\n\r\nIn one of his Sonnets, Shakespeare alludes to the old alembic of the\r\nalchemist in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n    “What potions have I drunk of Syren tears,\r\n    Distill’d from limbecks foul as hell within”.\r\n\r\nAnd in the following verse he deals with some theories of medical\r\ntreatment:—\r\n\r\n    “Like as to make our appetites more keen,\r\n    With eager compounds we our palate urge;\r\n    As, to prevent our maladies unseen,\r\n    We sicken to shun sickness when we purge:\r\n    Even so, being full of your ne’er-cloying sweetness,\r\n    To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding,\r\n    And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness\r\n    To be diseas’d, ere that there was true needing.\r\n    Thus policy in love, to anticipate\r\n    The ills that were not, grew to faults assur’d,\r\n    And brought to medicine a healthful state\r\n    Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cur’d.\r\n        But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,\r\n        Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.”[38]\r\n\r\n        [38] _Sonnets_, verses 118, 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSPENSER.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdmund Spenser was born in London towards the close of the year 1552,\r\nand in his after career, added lustre to an age which for brilliancy\r\nin literature has never been equalled in the history of this country.\r\nHe lived for some time in Lancashire in his early days, but in 1578\r\nquitted the country for the court. It was probably his friend Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh who introduced him to court-favour and Queen Elizabeth.\r\nIn 1589 he published the _Faerie Queen_, a poem which will ever live in\r\nEnglish literature.\r\n\r\nThere are few allusions in the works of Edmund Spenser to medicinal\r\nplants, although he frequently mentions salves and other methods of\r\nadministration used in the leechcraft of his time, as instanced in the\r\nfollowing quotations:—\r\n\r\n                  “Eftsoons he gan apply relief\r\n    Of salves and med’cines which has passing prefe”.[39]\r\n\r\n        [39] _The Faerie Queen_, book i., canto x.\r\n\r\n    “With wholesome read of sad sobriety,\r\n    To rule the stubborn rage of passion blind,\r\n    Give salves to every sore, but counsel to the mind.”[40]\r\n\r\n        [40] _The Faerie Queen_, book vi., canto vi.\r\n\r\nIn the first book of the _Faerie Queen_ Spenser makes an interesting\r\nallusion to trees and their uses in his time, in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n    “Much gave they praise the trees so straight and high:\r\n    The sailing pine; the cedar proud and tall;\r\n    The vine-prop elm; the poplar never dry;\r\n    The builder oak, sole king of forests all;\r\n    The aspen good for staves; the cypress funeral;\r\n    The laurel, meed of mighty conquerors\r\n    And poets sage; the fir that weepeth still;\r\n    The willow, worn of forlorn paramours;\r\n    The yew, obedient to the binder’s will;\r\n    The birch for shafts; the sallow for the mill;\r\n    The myrrh sweet bleeding in the bitter wound;\r\n    The warlike beech; the ash for nothing ill;\r\n    The fruitful olive, and the plantane round;\r\n    The carver holm; the maple, seldom inward sound”.[41]\r\n\r\n        [41] _The Faerie Queen_, book i., canto i.\r\n\r\nThe sailing pine was doubtless so called on account of it being so\r\nlargely used for the masts of ships. The wood of the aspen tree was\r\noften used for making staves on account of its toughness. He alludes\r\nalso to the ancient use of the cypress at funeral rites, and the\r\nwearing of the willow as a badge of the unfortunate; the yew, chiefly\r\nemployed for making the long bows; the birch, for the strongest arrows;\r\nand the sallow, which when plaited formed the sails of the windmills.\r\n\r\nIncisions are cut in the bark of the myrrh tree in order that the gum\r\nshould exude as from an open wound.\r\n\r\nBeech was used for the shafts of spears and axes, and the carver holm\r\nor cutting holly was so called from its prickles.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth canto we have mention of the flower-de-luce:—\r\n\r\n    “The lily, lady of the flowering field,\r\n    The flow’r-de-luce her lovely paramour”.[42]\r\n\r\nFlower-de-luce was the old name for the iris, and is also the French\r\n_fleur-de-lis_, and the origin of that symbol. The roots of many of the\r\niris species have long been used in medicine for their cathartic and\r\nemetic properties. That of the _I. florentina_ is well known for its\r\nsweet violet smell, and from early times has been employed to sweeten\r\nthe breath and as an ingredient in tooth powders. Another old name for\r\nthis plant was “The flower of delights”.\r\n\r\n        [42] _The Faerie Queen_, book ii., canto vi.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh canto the poet shows he was well acquainted with some\r\nmedicinal plants, and gives us quite a group of “herbs of ill favour”.\r\n\r\n    “There mournful cypress grew in greatest store;\r\n    And trees of bitter gall; and ebon sad;\r\n    Dead sleeping poppy, and black hellebore;\r\n    Cold coloquintida, and tetra mad;\r\n    Mortal samnitis; and cicuta bad,\r\n    With which th’ unjust Athenians made to die\r\n    Wise Socrates, who, thereof quaffing glad,\r\n    Pour’d out his life and last philosophy\r\n    To the fair Critias, his dearest belamy!”[43]\r\n\r\nHere we have mention of the narcotic poppy and the black hellebore,\r\na drastic purgative with which tradition states Melampus, the great\r\nsoothsayer and physician, cured the daughters of Prœtus, King of\r\nArgos, of madness. Also the colocynth or bitter apple; tetra mad, an\r\nold name for the belladonna or deadly nightshade; savin, here called\r\nmortal samnitis, a plant possessing powerful properties, used in\r\nmedicine from the time of the Romans; and the cicuta or hemlock, which\r\nformed the active ingredient in the poison cup of the Greeks.\r\n\r\n        [43] _The Faerie Queen_, book ii., canto vii.\r\n\r\nIn the _Shepherd’s Calendar_ we have another allusion to the black\r\nhellebore:—\r\n\r\n    “Here grows melampode ev’rywhere,\r\n    And terebinth, good for goats;\r\n    The one my madding kids to smear,\r\n    The next to heal their throats”.[44]\r\n\r\nThe ancient name for hellebore was melampus root, hence the name\r\nmelampode, which doubtless arose from the old tradition. By terebinth\r\nthe poet probably means one of the species of pine from which\r\nturpentine is obtained.\r\n\r\n        [44] _Shepherd’s Calendar_—July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nGOETHE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Faust-legend around which Goethe wove his great tragedy, was one\r\nof those floating traditions which were common in the romantic lore\r\nof many countries during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and\r\nwhich seem to have originated in the general belief in occult forces.\r\nThe Johann Faust of the popular stories was undoubtedly an individual\r\nof that name, born towards the close of the fifteenth century in the\r\nlittle town of Knittlingen, near Maulbronn, in Würtemberg. His parents\r\nwere poor, but he was enabled by the bequest of a rich uncle to study\r\nmedicine. He attended the University of Cracow (where he probably\r\nreceived his doctor’s degree), studied magic which was there taught\r\nas an accepted branch of knowledge, and appears to have afterwards\r\ntravelled for many years through Europe. Manlius, the disciple of\r\nMelancthon, quotes the latter as having said: “This fellow Faust\r\nescaped from our town of Wittenberg, after our Duke John had given the\r\norder to have him imprisoned. He also escaped from Nuremberg under the\r\nlike circumstances. This sorcerer Faust, an abominable beast, a common\r\nsewer of many devils, boasted that he, by his magic arts had enabled\r\nthe Imperial armies to win their victories in Italy.” It was probably\r\nthe famous battle of Pavia fought in 1525 of which Faust spoke, as\r\nthe time of his visit to Wittenberg appears to have been about the\r\nyear 1530. Further evidence of the existence of such a character is to\r\nbe found in the _Index Sanitatis_ of the physician, Philip Begardi,\r\npublished at Worms in 1539, and in the _Sermones Conviviales_ of Johann\r\nGast, who gives an account of a dinner given by Faust at Basle at which\r\nhe was present. The original form of the legend is contained in a work\r\npublished by Spiess in Frankfurt in 1587, entitled the _History of Dr.\r\nJoh. Faust, the Notorious Sorcerer and Black-artist, etc., etc._ This\r\nbook was first translated into English in 1590, and from it Marlowe\r\ndoubtless obtained the material for his tragedy of “Dr. Faustus,” which\r\nappears to have been first performed in London in 1593, the year of his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nIn the first act of Goethe’s tragedy we are introduced to Faust, who\r\nis sitting in his lofty-arched Gothic chamber or laboratory, his desk\r\npiled high with the works of noted writers on magic and astrology.\r\n\r\n    “And this one Book of Mystery\r\n    From Nostradamus’ very hand,\r\n    Is’t not sufficient company?”\r\n\r\nNostradamus, the famous astrologer, was born at St. Remy, in Provence,\r\nin the year 1503. His real name was Michel de Notre Dame. For some\r\ntime he practised as a physician, but finally devoted himself to\r\nastrology, and published in 1555 a collection of prophecies in rhymed\r\nquatrains, entitled _Les Prophecies de Michel Nostradamus_, which\r\ncreated an immediate sensation, and found many believers, especially as\r\nthe death of Henry II. of France seemed to verify one of his mystical\r\npredictions. He was appointed physician to Charles IX., and continued\r\nthe publication of his prophecies, asserting, however, that the study\r\nof the planetary aspects was not alone sufficient, but that the gift of\r\nsecond sight, which God grants only to a few chosen persons, is also\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nHe died in the year 1566.\r\n\r\nIn the following lines allusion is made to two popular forms of\r\ndivination.\r\n\r\n    “CITIZEN’S DAUGHTER. Come, Agatha! I shun the witch’s sight\r\n    Before folks, lest there be misgiving!\r\n    ’Tis true, she showed me, on Saint Andrew’s Night,\r\n    My future sweetheart, just as he were living.\r\n\r\n    “THE OTHER. She showed me mine, in crystal clear,\r\n    With several wild young blades, a soldier-lover”.\r\n\r\nSt. Andrew’s Night is celebrated in some parts of Germany by forms\r\nof divination very similar to those which are practised in Scotland\r\non Hallow E’en. The maidens believe that by calling upon St. Andrew,\r\nundressed, before getting into bed, their future sweetheart will appear\r\nto them in a dream. Another charm is practised by pouring melted lead\r\nthrough the wards of a key, wherein there is the form of a cross, into\r\na basin of water brought between eleven o’clock and midnight: the\r\ncooling lead will then take the form of tools which indicate the trade\r\nof the destined lover.\r\n\r\nCrystal gazing, which we have described in a previous chapter, was also\r\na common method of foretelling future events, and young maidens were\r\nsupposed to be specially successful in its practise.\r\n\r\nFaust’s description of the preparation of a panacea is a good\r\nillustration of the fantastic language employed by the alchemists:—\r\n\r\n    “Who, in his dusky work-shop bending,\r\n    With proved adepts in company,\r\n    Made, from his recipes unending,\r\n        Opposing substances agree.\r\n    There was a Lion red, a wooer daring,\r\n    Within the Lily’s tepid bath espoused,\r\n    And both, tormented then by flame unsparing,\r\n        By turns in either bridal chamber housed.\r\n    If then appeared, with colours splendid,\r\n    The young Queen in her crystal shell,\r\n    This was the medicine—the patient’s woes soon ended,\r\n    And none demanded—who got well?”\r\n\r\nGoethe is said to have drawn this description partly from Paracelsus,\r\nand partly from Welling’s _Opus Mago Cabbalisticum_. The “Lion red” is\r\ncinnabar, called a “wooer daring” on account of its action in rushing\r\nto an intimate union with other bodies. “The Lily” is a preparation of\r\nantimony, which bore the name of Lilium Paracelsi. Red, moreover, is\r\nthe masculine, and white the feminine colour. The retort containing\r\nthese substances was first placed in a “tepid bath” and gradually\r\nheated, then “tormented by flame unsparing,” the two were driven from\r\none “bridal chamber” to another, that is, their wedded fumes were\r\nforced by the heat into an alembic. If then the “Young Queen,” the\r\nsublimated compound, appeared with a brilliant colour in the alembic\r\nthe proper result was obtained and this signified the true medicine.\r\n\r\nIn scene iii. Mephistopheles says:—\r\n\r\n    “My steps by one slight obstacle controlled,—\r\n    The wizard’s foot, that on your threshold is”.\r\n\r\nThe wizard’s foot or pentagram, was supposed to possess an especial\r\npotency against evil spirits, and was often chalked on the door-steps\r\nto protect the household from their influence. It consisted of a\r\nfive-rayed star, thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe belief in its efficacy doubtless sprang from the circumstance that\r\nit resolves itself into three triangles, and thus a triple symbol of\r\nthe Trinity. Paracelsus ascribes a similar, though a lesser degree\r\nof virtue to the hexagram. Another peculiarity of the pentagram is,\r\nthat it may be drawn complete from one point, without lifting the pen,\r\nand therefore belongs to those _involuntary_ hieroglyphics which we\r\nsometimes make in moments of abstraction. In scene xiii. where Margaret\r\nplucks a star-flower, and pulls off the leaves one after the other,\r\nmurmuring—\r\n\r\n    “He loves me—loves me not”\r\n\r\nwe have an illustration of a favourite mode of amorous divination by\r\nmeans of flowers still practised by country maidens.\r\n\r\nThe custom is of great antiquity and is mentioned by Theocritus. The\r\nsingle daisy is a favourite flower for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following allusion to the red mouse refers to an ancient\r\nsuperstition concerning one of the many forms of diabolical possession.\r\nThe “evil one” was supposed to enter the body in the form of a red\r\nmouse.\r\n\r\n    “MEPHISTOPHELES. Wherefore forsakest thou the lovely maiden,\r\n                     That in the dance so sweetly sang?\r\n\r\n    “FAUST. Ah! in the midst of it there sprang\r\n            A red mouse from her mouth—sufficient reason.”\r\n\r\nIn the second part of the work we are introduced to an astrologer who,\r\nprompted by Mephistopheles, delivers himself as follows:—\r\n\r\n    “The Sun himself is gold of purest ray;\r\n    The herald, Mercury, serves for love and pay;\r\n    Dame Venus has bewitched you all, for she,\r\n    Early and late, looks on you lovingly;\r\n    Chaste Luna has her whims, no two alike;\r\n    Mars threatens you, although he may not strike,\r\n    And Jupiter is still the splendid star.\r\n    Saturn is great, though seeming small and far;\r\n    As metal, him we don’t much venerate,\r\n    Of value slight, though heavy in his weight.\r\n    Now, when of Sol and Luna unions had,—\r\n    Silver with gold,—then is the world made glad:\r\n    All else, with them, is easy to attain,—\r\n    Palaces, gardens, cheeks of rosy stain;\r\n    And thus procures this highly learned man,\r\n    Who that can do which none of us e’er can.”\r\n\r\nThe astrologer here alludes to the seven principal metals, to which\r\nthe early alchemists attached the names of seven planets. The Sun was\r\ngold, the Moon silver, Mercury quicksilver, Venus copper, Mars iron,\r\nJupiter tin, and Saturn lead.\r\n\r\nIn the same act, reference is made to an old tradition that is still\r\nbelieved in some parts of Germany.\r\n\r\n                    “Lo! at hand there\r\n    Is ancient juice of strength divine.\r\n    Yet trust to him who’s knowledge gotten,\r\n    The wood o’ the staves has long been rotten,\r\n      A cask of tartar holds the wine.”\r\n\r\nIt is a general belief in the wine districts, that when a cask of wine\r\nhas been kept for centuries, the crust of argol or crude cream of\r\ntartar which is gradually deposited, may acquire such a consistency\r\nas to hold the liquid when the staves have rotted away. The wine thus\r\nbecomes its own cask, and preserves itself in a thick oily state. It is\r\nthen said to possess wonderful medicinal virtues.\r\n\r\nLater on Mephistopheles is asked by a blonde beauty for a cure for her\r\ncomplexion.\r\n\r\n          “One word, sir! Here you see a visage fair,—\r\n          In sorry summer I another wear!\r\n          There sprout a hundred brown and reddish freckles,\r\n          And vex my lily skin with ugly speckles.\r\n          A cure!\r\n\r\n    “MEPHISTOPHELES. ’Tis pity! shining fair, yet smitten,—\r\n          Spotted, when May comes, like a panther-kitten!\r\n          Take frog’s spawn, tongues of toads, which contribute,\r\n          Under the full moon deftly distillate,\r\n          And when it wanes, apply the mixture:\r\n          Next spring, the spots will be no more a fixture.\r\n\r\n    “A BRUNETTE. To sponge upon you, what a crowd’s advancing!\r\n          I beg a remedy: a frozen foot\r\n          Annoys me much, in walking as in dancing;\r\n          And awkwardly I manage to salute.\r\n\r\n    “MEPHISTOPHELES. A gentle kick permit, then, from my foot!\r\n\r\n    “THE BRUNETTE. Well,—that might happen when the two are lovers.\r\n\r\n    “MEPHISTOPHELES. My kick a more important meaning covers;\r\n          _Similia similibus_, when one is sick,\r\n          The foot cures foot, each limb its hurt can palliate;\r\n          Come near! Take heed! and pray you don’t retaliate!”\r\n\r\nFrog’s spawn and toad’s tongues formed an old remedy for spots on the\r\nskin, and in the “gentle kick” we have a satire on the homœopathic\r\ntheory of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nLE SAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Sage draws a vivid picture of the medical practitioner of his day in\r\nhis well-known work _Gil Blas_. Doctor Sangrado, bigoted, obstinate,\r\nand dominated by one idea, was doubtless very true to nature, and\r\na type of physician not unfrequently met with even later than the\r\nseventeenth century. The character is supposed to have been drawn from\r\nthat of Doctor Hecquet, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Paris, a man\r\nextremely thin and spare in body, and who is said never to have drank\r\nanything but water.\r\n\r\nLe Sage describes his physician as “a tall, meagre, pale man, who had\r\nkept the shears of Clotho employed during forty years. He had a very\r\nsolemn appearance, weighed his discourse, and gave an emphasis to his\r\nexpressions: his reason was geometrical, and his opinions extremely\r\nsingular.” All the city looked upon him as another Hippocrates. The\r\nlicentiate Sedillo, a fat clerical epicurean, having fallen sick with\r\nthe fever and gout, this great physician was called in, and after\r\nexamining his patient delivered himself of the following diagnosis:\r\n“The business here is to supply the defect of obstructed perspiration;\r\nothers in my place would doubtless prescribe saline draughts,\r\ndiuretics, diaphoretics, and such medicines as abound with mercury and\r\nsulphur; but cathartics and sudorifics are pernicious drugs invented by\r\nquacks, and all the preparations of chemistry are only calculated to do\r\nmischief,” said this disciple of Æsculapius.\r\n\r\n“You must renounce all palatable food; and do you drink wine?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the poor canon; “wine and water.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! watered as much as you please,” replied the physician: “what an\r\nirregularity is here! what a frightful regimen! You ought to have been\r\ndead long ago. If you had drunk nothing but pure water all your life,\r\nand had been satisfied with simple nourishment, such as, for example,\r\nboiled apples, peas, and beans, you would not now be tormented with\r\ngout, and all your limbs would perform their functions with ease.”\r\n\r\nThe poor canon promised to obey in all these things, but the doctor\r\nhadn’t finished yet, for he sent for a surgeon, and ordered him to let\r\n“six good porringers of blood as the first effort” to supply the want\r\nof perspiration.\r\n\r\n“And return in three hours, and take as much more, and repeat the same\r\nto-morrow,” said this veritable leech to the surgeon, “for a patient\r\ncannot be bled too much.”\r\n\r\nBesides this, the unfortunate patient was dosed incessantly with\r\nwarm water, two or three pints in as many draughts, “for,” said the\r\nphysician, “water is the true specific in all distempers what-ever”.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder that in less than two days, Gil Blas tells us, the old\r\ncanon was reduced to the last extremity, and soon after breathed his\r\nlast, much to the regret of the physician, who declared it was because\r\nhe had not lost blood enough, nor drank a sufficient quantity of water.\r\n\r\nThe mercurial Gil Blas shortly after took service with this learned\r\nmedico, and kept his books, which he declares might have been with\r\ngreat justice styled a register of the dead; for almost all the people\r\nwhose names it contained died soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut after being about a week with the physician, Gil Blas was seized\r\nwith a cramp which he attributed to the quantity of the “universal\r\ndissolvent” he was compelled to imbibe, and had to consult his master.\r\n\r\n“Why, truly, Gil Blas, I am not at all surprised that thou dost not\r\nenjoy good health,” said the hydropathist. “Thou dost not drink enough,\r\nmy friend. Water taken in small quantities serves only to disentangle\r\nthe particles of the bile, and give them more activity, whereas\r\nthey should be drowned in a copious dilution. I will warrant the\r\nconsequence, and if thou wilt not take my word, Celsus himself shall be\r\nthy security.”\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be wondered at that Gil Blas soon came to believe that\r\nhe also had a natural talent for the medical profession, which was so\r\neasy to acquire and lucrative to practise, and was rapidly promoted as\r\nassistant to his master.\r\n\r\n“Listen, my child,” said the doctor one day, “I will immediately\r\ndisclose to thee the whole extent of that salutary art which I have\r\nprofessed so many years. Know, my friend, all that is required is to\r\nbleed thy patients and make them drink warm water. This is the secret\r\nof curing all the distempers incident to man. I have nothing more to\r\nimpart; thou knowest physic to the very bottom.”\r\n\r\nThus the _ci-devant_ valet soon robed himself in a physician’s gown\r\nand long _perruque_, then went forth to practise, but resolved to\r\ndrink wine every day, of which he said he drank huge draughts, and\r\n(no disparagement to the Roman oracle) “the more I filled my stomach,\r\nthe less did that organ complain of the injury it received”. So he\r\nbled and watered the community. But the time soon came when this young\r\npractitioner met with a reverse. When called in to consultation with\r\na Spanish doctor of another school, a dispute arose on the subject of\r\nthe water-cure, which ended in a pitched battle being fought between\r\nthe rival medicos over the unfortunate patient, and they were not\r\nseparated until each had lost a handful of hair. This ended in the\r\ndischarge of Gil Blas, who immediately took the opportunity of imbibing\r\na considerable quantity of wine at the first tavern he came across, and\r\nreturned to his patron in a condition of considerable elevation.\r\n\r\nThe wine having made him thirsty, he consumed a large quantity of water\r\nwhile telling his story.\r\n\r\n“I see, Gil Blas, thou hast no longer an aversion to water,” said the\r\nphysician. “Heaven be praised! thou drinkest it now like nectar! a\r\nchange that does not at all surprise me, my friend.”\r\n\r\n“Sir,” replied Gil Blas, “there’s a time for all things; I would not\r\nat present give a pint of water for a hogshead of wine.”\r\n\r\nThat Le Sage had a very poor opinion of the professors of the art of\r\nmedicine in his time may be gathered from the following conversation\r\nwhich Gil Blas holds with his employer: “Scarcely a day passed in which\r\nwe did not visit eight or ten patients each, from whence it may be\r\neasily conceived what a quantity of blood was spilt and water drank.\r\nBut I do not know how it happened, all our sick died. We very seldom\r\nhad occasion to make three visits to one patient; at the second we were\r\neither told that he had just been buried, or we found them at the last\r\ngasp; and as I was but a young physician who had not yet had time to be\r\ninured to murder, I began to be very uneasy at the fatal events which\r\nmight be laid to my charge.” And so he at last gave it up, after being\r\nthreatened with his life by a gallant, whose wife had succumbed to his\r\ndrastic treatment.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the story Gil Blas has an interview with his\r\nformer master, who describes to his old pupil the change that had\r\ntaken place in the practice of medicine in a few years, which forms an\r\ninteresting account of the transition through which the medical art was\r\npassing towards the end of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n“Ah, my son,” says the worthy doctor, “what a change has happened in\r\nphysic within these few years. There are in this city, physicians,\r\nor such as call themselves so, who are yoked to the triumphal car of\r\nantimony—_currus triumphalis antimonii_. Truants from the school\r\nof Paracelsus, adorers of kermes, accidental curers who make the\r\nwhole science of medicine consist in knowing how to prepare chymical\r\ndrugs. What shall I tell you! Everything is turned topsy-turvey in\r\ntheir method. Bleeding at the foot, for example, hitherto so seldom\r\npractised, is now almost the only bleeding in use. Those purgatives\r\nwhich were formerly gentle and benign are now changed for emetics and\r\nkermes.\r\n\r\n“I published a book against this brigandage of medicine, but it was no\r\nuse. The surgeons, mad with ambition of acting as physicians, think\r\nthemselves sufficiently qualified when there is nothing to be done\r\nbut to give kermes and emetics, to which they add bleeding at the\r\nfoot, according to their own fancy. They even proceed so far as to\r\nmix kermes in apozems and cordial potions; and so they are on a par\r\nwith your celebrated prescribers. This contagion has spread also among\r\nthe cloisters. There are some monks who act both as apothecaries and\r\nsurgeons. These apes of medicine apply themselves to chemistry, and\r\ncompose pernicious drugs, with which they abridge the lives of the\r\nreverend fathers.”\r\n\r\nThe doctor describes the dawn of pharmacy in France and Spain, which\r\nwas first practised by the surgeons who became surgeon-apothecaries.\r\nThe use of emetics in medical treatment came largely into vogue in\r\n1658. It is said that the life of Louis XIV. was saved by an emetic\r\nadministered by Dusausoi, in opposition to the opinion of Vallot, the\r\nchief physician to the king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nBEN JONSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Jonson gives a description of the itinerant doctor in Queen\r\nElizabeth’s time, who travelled the country, usually accompanied by\r\na jester or zany, as he was called, who carried the box or chest\r\ncontaining his remedies. We see the professor with his copper rings,\r\nshining chain, better than gold but not quite so valuable, his yellow\r\njewel, his dirty feather-embroidered suit, grave look, and starched\r\nbeard.[45] Hush! he begins:—\r\n\r\n        [45] Ben Jonson’s _Fox_, act ii., scene i.\r\n\r\n“Most noble gentlemen and my worthy patrons!—I have nothing to sell,\r\nlittle or nothing to sell, though I protest, I and my six servants are\r\nnot able to make of my precious balsam so fast as it is fetched away\r\nfrom my lodging by the worthy men of the town. O health! health! the\r\nblessing of the rich, the riches of the poor, who can buy thee at too\r\ndear a rate? And since there is no enjoying the world without thee, for\r\nwhen a humid flux or catarrh, by the mutability of air, falls from\r\nyour head into an arm or shoulder, take you a rose noble or an angel\r\nof gold and apply to the place affected; see what good effect it can\r\nwork. No, no; to this blessed unguent, this rare extraction, that hath\r\nonly power to dispose all malignant humours that proceed either of hot,\r\ncold, moist, or windy causes; to fortify the most indigest and crude\r\nstomach—aye, were it one that through extreme weakness vomited blood,\r\napplying only a warm napkin to the place after the unction and fricace;\r\nfor the vertigoe in the head, putting out a drop into your nostrils,\r\nlikewise behind the ears, a most sovereign and approved remedy; the\r\n_mal caduco_, cramps, convulsions, paralysies, epilepsies, tremor\r\ncordia, retind nerves, ill vapours of the spleen, and stoppings of the\r\nliver, or stops a dysentery, immediately cureth poison of the small\r\nguts, and cures melancholia, being taken and applied according to my\r\nprinted recipe (shows his bill and vial, and the zany sings a song). It\r\nwill cost you eight crowns, and has cured all the kings in Christendom.\r\nMany have attempted to make this oil, wasting thousands of crowns in\r\nthe ingredients (for there go to it sixty several simples, besides\r\nsome quantity of human fat for conglutination, which we buy of the\r\nanatomists); but when these practitioners come to the last decoction,\r\nblow, blow! puff, puff! it flies in fumes, poor wretches.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen, honourable gentlemen, I will undertake by virtue of\r\nchemical art, out of the honourable hat that covers your head, to\r\nextract the four elements—that is to say, the fire, air, water, and\r\nearth, and return you your felt without burn or stain. You all know,\r\nhonourable gentlemen, I never valued this ampulla or vial at less than\r\neight crowns, but for this time I am content to be deprived of it for\r\nsix; six crowns, then, is the price in courtesy. I know you cannot\r\noffer me less; take it or leave it, howsoever, both it and I are at\r\nyour service (zany sings another song).\r\n\r\n“Well, I am in a humour at this time to make a present of the small\r\nquantity my coffer contains to the rich in courtesy, and to the poor\r\nfor God’s sake; wherefore now mark, I asked you six crowns, and six\r\ncrowns at other times you have paid me: you shall not give me six\r\ncrowns, nor five, nor four, nor three, nor two, nor one, nor half a\r\none, nor a shilling; sixpence it will cost you or £60. Expect no lower\r\nprice, for I will not bate a jot; and this I take away as a pledge\r\nof your love, to carry something from amongst you to show I am not\r\ncondemned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSIR WALTER SCOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat picturesque period when the astrologer formed part of the\r\n_entourage_ of almost every European court, and was petted by emperors\r\nand kings, is graphically described by Sir Walter Scott in _Quentin\r\nDurward_ in the following words:—\r\n\r\n“Louis XI. of France had retired to the castle of Plessis, where\r\nhe received an ambassador from the Duke of Burgundy, with whom his\r\nrelations were somewhat strained. Attached to the court of the king,\r\nwe are told, and lodged in magnificent apartments, was the celebrated\r\nastrologer, poet, and philosopher, Galeotti Martius, author of the\r\nfamous treatise _De Vulgo Incognitis_. He had long flourished at\r\nthe court of the King of Hungary, from whom, it is said, he was in\r\nsome measure decoyed by Louis, who grudged the Hungarian monarch the\r\ncounsels of a sage accounted so skilful in reading the decrees of\r\nHeaven. Martius was none of those ascetic, withered, pale professors\r\nof mystic learning of those days, who bleared their eyes over the\r\nmidnight furnace, and macerated their bodies by outmatching the\r\npolar bear. He was trained in arms, and renowned as a wrestler. His\r\napartment was splendidly furnished, and on a large oaken table lay a\r\nvariety of mathematical and astrological instruments, all of the most\r\nrich materials and curious workmanship. His astrolabe of silver was\r\nthe gift of the Emperor of Germany, and his Jacob’s staff of ebony,\r\njointed with gold, was a mark of esteem from the reigning Pope. In\r\nperson the astrologer was a tall, bulky, yet stately man. His features,\r\nthough rather overgrown, were dignified and noble, and a Santon might\r\nhave envied the dark and downward sweep of his long descending beard.\r\nHis dress was a chamber robe of the richest Genoa velvet, with ample\r\nsleeves clasped with frogs of gold, and lined with sables. It was\r\nfastened round his middle by a broad belt of virgin parchment, round\r\nwhich were represented in crimson characters the signs of the zodiac.\r\n\r\n“Such was the astrologer of Louis XI., who was consulted in matters of\r\nstate policy and intrigue, and exercised a considerable influence over\r\nthat weak monarch.\r\n\r\n“The costly nature of such a courtier is well illustrated in an\r\ninterview which the king has with his astrologer, and leaves on his\r\ntable a purse of gold as a reward for some special service. But the\r\ncontents did not by any means satisfy the man of science.\r\n\r\n“He emptied the purse, which contained neither more nor less than ten\r\ngold pieces.\r\n\r\n“The indignation of the astrologer was extreme.\r\n\r\n“‘Thinks he that for such paltry rate of hire I will practice that\r\ncelestial science which I have studied with the Armenian Abbot of\r\nIstrahoff, who had not seen the sun for forty years; with the Greek\r\nDubravius, who is said to have raised the dead; and have even visited\r\nthe Scheik Ebn Hali in his cave in the desert of Thebais? No, by\r\nHeaven! He that contemns art shall perish through his ignorance. Ten\r\npieces!—a pittance which I am half-ashamed to offer to Toinette to buy\r\nher new breast laces.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nDUMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPharmacy, pure and simple, occupies but a small space in literature,\r\nalthough the disciples of the sister arts of medicine and alchemy have\r\noften formed interesting studies for many great writers of fiction.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the scientific knowledge of the average novelist is, as\r\na rule, extremely limited, and the effects they attribute to certain\r\ndrugs are usually as fabulous as those believed in the dark ages.\r\nThey tell us of mysterious poisons of untold power, an infinitesimal\r\nquantity of which will cause instantaneous death without leaving a\r\ntrace behind. They also describe anæsthetics so powerful that a whiff\r\nfrom a bottle or the wave of a handkerchief will at once produce\r\ninsensibility for any period desired. In fact the writer of romance has\r\na _pharmacopœia_ of his own.\r\n\r\nBut why should we cavil at it or try to analyse it in the prosaic\r\ntest-tube of modern science.\r\n\r\nExclude the marvellous and mysterious, and you kill romance. It\r\nperforms its mission if it succeeds in interesting and amusing us, so\r\nwe should be lenient if it errs in mere matters of science.\r\n\r\nThe art of the romancer reaches its height when it succeeds in mixing\r\nthe possible with the impossible so that we can scarce perceive it.\r\n\r\nThere are few characters in the realm of romantic fiction more\r\nfascinating than the Count Monte Christo. As a work of imaginative\r\npower and absorbing interest, this masterpiece of Dumas stands unique.\r\nNothing is impossible to this extraordinary individual, and incident\r\nafter incident of the most dramatic and exciting nature crowd one upon\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe count, who is supposed to have studied the art of medicine in the\r\nEast, has always a remedy ready for every ill; from his hashis, in\r\nwhich he is a profound believer, to his mysterious stimulating elixir,\r\na liquid, we are told, of the colour of blood, which he always kept in\r\na phial composed of Bohemian glass.\r\n\r\nA single drop of this vital fluid, if allowed to fall on the lips,\r\nalmost before it reaches them, restores the marble and inanimate form\r\nto life. His pill-boxes were composed of emeralds and precious stones\r\nof huge size, and their contents were composed of drugs whose effect\r\nwas almost beyond comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn the _Memoirs of a Physician_, Dumas describes an alchemist of the\r\nlast century, a time when the seekers after the philosopher’s stone\r\nand the _elixir vitæ_ had almost died out. Joseph Balsamo, the hero\r\nof the story, drawn from the life of the notorious Cagliostro, is a\r\nnecromancer of the modern kind, who works his marvels by what is now\r\nknown as hypnotism or mesmerism, a condition little understood in those\r\ndays. Althotas, an alchemist of renown, lives with Balsamo, and aids\r\nhim in his researches.\r\n\r\nHe is described as “an old man of over a hundred years, with grey\r\neyes, hooked nose, and trembling bony hands, and he sits half-buried\r\nin his chair. Clad in a long silk robe, now nothing but a shapeless,\r\ncolourless ragged covering, he grumbled as he drew over his ears his\r\ncap of velvet, from under which a few locks of silver hair peeped out.\r\n\r\n“The dwelling of the alchemist,” says the novelist, “might be about\r\neight or nine feet high and sixteen in diameter; it was lighted from\r\nthe top like a well, and hermetically closed on the four sides.”\r\n\r\n“Besides the phials, boxes, books, and papers strewed around, copper\r\npincers were seen, and pieces of charcoal which had been dipped in\r\nvarious liquids; there was also a large vase half full of water, and\r\nfrom the roof, hung by threads, were bundles of herbs, some apparently\r\ngathered the night before, others a hundred years ago. A keen odour\r\nprevailed in this laboratory, which in one less strange would have been\r\ncalled a perfume.\r\n\r\n“The old man was seated in his armchair on wheels, in the centre of a\r\nmarble table formed like a horseshoe, and heaped up with a whole world,\r\nor rather whole chaos, of plants, phials, tools, books, instruments,\r\nand papers covered with cabalistic characters.\r\n\r\n“He was so absorbed that he never raised his head when Balsamo appeared.\r\n\r\n“The light of an astral lamp, suspended from the culminating point of\r\nthe window in the roof, fell on his bald, shining head.\r\n\r\n“He was turning to and fro in his fingers a small white bottle,\r\nthe transparency of which he was trying before his eye, as a good\r\nhousekeeper tries the eggs which she buys at market.\r\n\r\n“Balsamo gazed on him at first in silence; then, after a moment’s\r\npause:—\r\n\r\n“‘Well,’ said he, ‘have you any news?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, yes; come hither, Acharat, you see me enchanted—transported\r\nwith joy! I have found—I have found——’\r\n\r\n“‘What?’\r\n\r\n“‘Pardieu! what I sought.’\r\n\r\n“‘Gold?’\r\n\r\n“‘Gold, indeed! I am surprised at you!’\r\n\r\n“‘The diamond?’\r\n\r\n“‘Gold? diamonds? The man raves! A fine discovery, forsooth, to be\r\nrejoiced at!’\r\n\r\n“‘Then what you have found is your elixir?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, my son, yes!—the elixir of life! Life?—what do I say?—the\r\neternity of life!’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh!’ said Balsamo in a dejected voice (for he looked on this pursuit\r\nas mere insanity), ‘so it is that dream which occupies you still?’\r\n\r\n“But Althotas, without listening, continued to gaze delightedly at his\r\nphial.\r\n\r\n“‘At last,’ said he, ‘the combination is complete: the elixir of\r\nAristæus, twenty grains; balm of mercury, fifteen grains; precipitate\r\nof gold, fifteen grains; essence of the cedar of Lebanon, twenty-five\r\ngrains.’\r\n\r\n“‘But it seems to me that, with the exception of the elixir of\r\nAristæus, this is precisely your last combination, master?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, but I had not then discovered one more ingredient, without which\r\nall the rest are as nothing.’\r\n\r\n“‘And have you discovered it now?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes.’\r\n\r\n“‘Can you procure it?’\r\n\r\n“‘I should think so!’\r\n\r\n“‘What is it?’\r\n\r\n“‘We must add to the several ingredients already combined in this\r\nphial, the three last drops of the life-blood of an infant.’\r\n\r\n“‘Well, but where will you procure this infant?’ said Balsamo\r\nhorror-struck.\r\n\r\n“‘I trust to you for that.’\r\n\r\n“‘To me? You are mad, master!’\r\n\r\n“‘Mad? And why?’ asked the old man, perfectly unmoved at this charge,\r\nand licking with the utmost delight a drop of the fluid which had\r\nescaped from the cork of the phial and was trickling down the side.\r\n\r\n“‘Why, for that purpose you must kill the child.’\r\n\r\n“‘Of course we must kill him; and the handsomer he is the better.’”\r\n\r\nBut in the end the old man falls a victim to his own infatuation, and\r\nat length dies incontinently without discovering the long-looked-for\r\narcana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nREADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn excellent picture of a physician of the fifteenth century is drawn\r\nby that master in the art of fiction, Charles Reade, in his work _The\r\nCloister and the Hearth_, a story of much historic interest and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe hero, Gerard, wounded in an encounter with a bear, lies sick at\r\nDüsseldorf, and is visited by a physician.\r\n\r\n“It was an imposing figure that entered the sick room; an old gentleman\r\nin a long sober gown trimmed with rich fur, cherry-coloured hose, and\r\npointed shoes, with a sword by his side in a morocco scabbard, a ruff\r\nround his neck, not only starched severely, but treacherously stiffened\r\nin furrows by rebatoes, or a little hidden framework of wood; and on\r\nhis head a four-cornered cap with a fur border; on his chin and bosom,\r\na majestic white beard. This was the full dress of a physician. A boy\r\nfollowed at his heels with a basket, where phials, lint, and surgical\r\ntools rather courted than shunned observation.”\r\n\r\nThe old doctor, on learning that his patient suffered from a wound,\r\nexclaimed, “This must be cauterised forthwith,” and immediately called\r\nfor his urchin to heat his iron. Gerard, who didn’t like the look of\r\nthings, informed the leech the wound was caused by the bear’s paw, and\r\nnot his jaw.\r\n\r\n“And why did’st not tell me that at once?”\r\n\r\n“Because you kept telling me instead.”\r\n\r\n“Never conceal aught from your leech, young man,” continued the senior,\r\nwho was a good talker, but one of the worst listeners in Europe. “Well,\r\nit is an ill business. All the horny excrescences of animals—to wit,\r\nclaws of tigers, panthers, badgers, cats, bears, and the like, and horn\r\nof deer, and nails of humans, especially children, are imbued with\r\ndirest poison. I had better have been bitten by a cur, _whatever you\r\nmay say_, than gored by a bull or stag, or scratched by bear. However,\r\nshalt have a good biting cataplasm for thy leg; meantime keep we the\r\nbody cool: put out thy tongue!—good!—fever. Let me feel thy pulse:\r\ngood!—fever! I ordain flebotomy, and on the instant. Hans, go fetch\r\nthe things needful, and I will entertain the patient meantime with\r\nreasons.”\r\n\r\nThe man of art then entered into a learned disquisition on pathology\r\nand the healthful practice of blood-letting. Time was evidently no\r\nobject, neither the extremity of his patient. “Think not,” said he\r\nwarmly, “that it suffices to bleed; any paltry barber can open a vein.\r\nThe art is to know what vein to empty, and for what disease. T’other\r\nday they brought me one tormented with earache. I let him blood in the\r\nright thigh, and away flew his earache. By-the-bye, he has died since\r\nthen. Another came with the toothache. I bleed him behind the ear, and\r\nrelieved him in a jiffey. He is also since dead as it happens.”\r\n\r\nAfter thus reciting his powers in venesection, the worthy doctor\r\nthought he could not do better than back it up with a show of\r\nknowledge, and recommenced on a new theme.\r\n\r\n“Know, young man, that two schools of art contend at this moment\r\nthroughout Europe. The Arabian, whose ancient oracles are Avicenna,\r\nRhazes, Allricazis; and its revivers are Chauliac and Lanfranc; and\r\nthe Greek school, whose modern champions are Bessarion, Platinus,\r\nand Marsilius Ficinus, but whose pristine doctors were medicine’s\r\nvery oracles—Phœbus, Chiron, Æsculapius, and his sons Podalinus\r\nand Machaon, Pythagoras, Democritus; Praxagoras, who invented the\r\narteries, and Dioctes, _qui primus urinæ animum dedit_. All these\r\ntaught orally. Then came Hippocrates, the eighteenth from Æsculapius,\r\nand of him we have manuscripts, to him we owe ‘the vital principle’. He\r\nalso invented the bandage, and tapped for water on the chest; and above\r\nall, he dissected, yet only quadrupeds, for the brutal prejudices of\r\nthe pagan vulgar withheld the human body from the knife of science. Him\r\nfollowed Aristotle, who gave us the aorta, the largest blood-vessel in\r\nthe human body.”\r\n\r\n“Surely, sir, the Almighty gave us all that is in our bodies, and not\r\nAristotle nor any Grecian man,” objected Gerard humbly.\r\n\r\n“Child! of course He gave us the thing; but Aristotle did more—he gave\r\nus the name of the thing. But young men will still be talking. The\r\nnext great light was Galen; he studied at Alexandria, then the home\r\nof science. He, justly malcontent with quadrupeds, dissected apes, as\r\ncoming nearer to man, and bled like a Trojan. Then came Theophilus, who\r\ngave us the nerves, the lacteal vessels, and the _pia mater_.”\r\n\r\n“I am put to silence, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And that is better still, for garrulous patients are ill to cure,\r\nespecially in fever. I say, then, that Eristratus gave us the cerebral\r\nnerves and the milk vessels; nay, more, he was the inventor of\r\nlithotomy, whatever you may say. Then came another whom I forget;\r\nyou do somewhat perturb me with your petty exceptions. Then came\r\nAmmonius, the author of lithotrity, and here comes Hans with the basin\r\nto stay your volubility. Blow thy chafer, boy, and hand me the basin;\r\n’tis well. Arabians, quotha! What are they but a sect of yesterday,\r\nwho about the year 1000 did fall in with the writings of those very\r\nGreeks, and read them awry, having no concurrent light of their own?\r\nfor their demi-god and camel-driver, Mahomed, impostor in science as\r\nin religion, had strictly forbidden them anatomy, even of the lower\r\nanimals, the which he who severeth from medicine, _tollit solem e\r\nmundo_, as Tully quoth. Nay, wonder not at my fervour, good youth;\r\nwhere the general weal stands in jeopardy a little warmth is civic,\r\nhumane, and honourable. Now, there is settled of late in this town a\r\npestilent Arabist, a mere empiric, who, despising anatomy, and scarce\r\nknowing Greek from Hebrew, hath yet spirited away half my patients, and\r\nI tremble for the rest. Put forth thine ankle; and thou, Hans, breathe\r\non the chafer.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of this tirade Gerard’s friend and fellow-traveller Denys\r\nappears on the scene, and will not hear of the bleeding being carried\r\nout. The blustering but good-tempered soldier soon comes to hot words\r\nwith the old physician on the subject, and a wordy battle ensues, which\r\nends by the doctor being offended, and decides to beat a dignified\r\nretreat. The concluding scene is too good to omit, and we will give it\r\nin the author’s own words.\r\n\r\n“Ah! you reject my skill, you scorn my art. My revenge shall be to\r\nleave you to yourself; lost idiot, take your last look at me, and at\r\nthe sun. Your blood be on your head!” And away he stamped.\r\n\r\nBut on reaching the door he whirled and came back, his wicker tail\r\ntwirling round after him like a cat’s.\r\n\r\n“In twelve hours at furthest you will be in the secondary stage of\r\nfever. Your head will split. Your carotids will thump. Aha! And let\r\nbut a pin fall, you will jump to the ceiling. Then send for me, and\r\n_I’ll not come_.” He departed. But at the door-handle gathered fury,\r\nwheeled and came flying, with pale, terror-stricken boy and wicker tail\r\nwhisking after him. “Next will come—_Cramps of the stomach_. Aha!\r\n\r\n“Then—_Bilious vomit_. Aha!\r\n\r\n“Then—_Cold sweat and deadly stupor_.\r\n\r\n“Then—_Confusion of all the senses_.\r\n\r\n“Then—_Bloody vomit_.\r\n\r\n“And after that nothing can save you, not even I; and if I could I\r\nwould not, and so farewell.”\r\n\r\nEven Denys changed colour at threats so fervent and precise; but Gerard\r\nonly gnashed his teeth with rage at the noise, and seized his hard\r\nbolster with kindling eye.\r\n\r\nThis added fuel to the fire, and brought the insulted ancient back from\r\nthe impassable door, with his whisking train.\r\n\r\n“And after that—_Madness!_\r\n\r\n“And after that—_Black vomit!_\r\n\r\n“And then—_Convulsions!_\r\n\r\n“And then—_That cessation of all vital functions the vulgar call\r\n‘death,’_ for which thank your own Satanic folly and insolence.\r\nFarewell.” He went. He came. He roared: “And think not to be buried\r\nin any Christian churchyard, for the bailiff is my good friend, and\r\nI shall tell him how and why you died: _felo de se! felo de se!_\r\nFarewell.”\r\n\r\nGerard sprang to his feet on the bed by some supernatural gymnastic\r\npower excitement lent him, and, seeing him so moved, the vindictive\r\norator came back at him fiercer than ever, to launch some master-threat\r\nthe world has unhappily lost, for as he came with his whisking train\r\nand shaking his fist, Gerard hurled the bolster furiously in his face\r\nand knocked him down like a shot, the boy’s head cracked under his\r\nfalling master’s, and crash went the dumb-stricken orator into the\r\nbasket, and there sat, wedged in an inverted angle, crushing phial\r\nafter phial. The boy, being light, was strewed afar, but in a squatting\r\nposture, so that they sat in a sequence, like graduated specimens, the\r\nsmaller howling. But soon the doctor’s face filled with horror, and he\r\nuttered a far louder and unearthly screech, and kicked and struggled\r\nwith wonderful agility for one of his age.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting on the hot coals.\r\n\r\nThey had singed the cloth, and were now biting the man. Struggling\r\nwildly but vainly to get out of the basket, he rolled over with it\r\nsideways, and lo! a great hissing; then the humane Gerard ran and\r\nwrenched off the tight basket, not without a struggle. The doctor lay\r\non his face groaning, handsomely singed with his own chafer, and slaked\r\na moment too late by his own villainous compounds, which, however,\r\nbeing as various and even beautiful in colour as they were odious in\r\ntaste, had strangely diversified his grey robe, and painted it more\r\ngaudy than neat.\r\n\r\nGerard and Denys raised him up and consoled him. “Courage, man, ’tis\r\nbut cautery; balm of Gilead—why, you recommended it but now to my\r\ncomrade here.”\r\n\r\nA curious specimen of medical treatment came to light when Philip, Duke\r\nof Burgundy, lay sick at Bruges. He was a doughty warrior this Earl of\r\nHolland, as he was sometimes called, and wealthy withal, so the best\r\nadvice was secured.\r\n\r\n“Now, paupers got sick and got well as Nature pleased, but woe betided\r\nthe rich,” says the novelist, “in an age when for one Mr. Malady\r\nkilled, three fell by Dr. Remedy.\r\n\r\n“The duke’s complaint, nameless then, is now called diphtheria. He was\r\nold and weak, so Dr. Remedy bled him.\r\n\r\n“The duke turned cold—wonderful!\r\n\r\n“Then Dr. Remedy had recourse to the arcana of science.\r\n\r\n“Ho! This is grave. Flay me an ape incontinent, to clap him to the\r\nduke’s breast! Officers of state ran septemvious, seeking an ape to\r\ncounteract the blood-thirsty tomfoolery of the human species.\r\n\r\n“But an ape could not be found.\r\n\r\n“Then Dr. Remedy grew impatient, and bade flay a dog.\r\n\r\n“A dog is next best to an ape; only it must be a dog all of one colour.\r\n\r\n“So they flayed a liver-coloured dog and clapped it, yet palpitating,\r\nto their sovereign’s breast; and he died.”\r\n\r\nThus ended Philip the Good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nDICKENS.\r\n\r\nThe apothecary of romance is almost invariably pale and lean, with head\r\nnearly destitute of hirsute covering, and a man of retiring habits and\r\nsad demeanour. This is perhaps because he gets little chance to make\r\nthe wherewithal to make him fat, and has few opportunities to seek\r\nenjoyment and recreation.\r\n\r\nDickens’ chemist, whom he describes in his pathetic little story\r\n_The Haunted Man_, is no exception to this rule. “Who could have\r\nseen his hollow cheek, his sunken, brilliant eye; his black-attired\r\nfigure, indefinably grim, although well knit and well proportioned;\r\nhis grizzled hair hanging like tangled seaweed about his face,—as if\r\nhe had been through his whole life a lonely mark for the chafing and\r\nbeating of the great deep of humanity—but might have said he looked\r\nlike a haunted man?\r\n\r\n“Who could have observed his manner—taciturn, thoughtful, gloomy,\r\nshadowed by habitual reserve, retiring always and jocund never, with a\r\ndistraught air of reverting to a bygone place and time, or of listening\r\nto some old echoes in his mind—but might have said it was the manner\r\nof a haunted man?\r\n\r\n“Who could have heard his voice—slow-speaking, deep and grave, with a\r\nnatural fulness and melody in it which he seemed to set himself against\r\nand stop—but might have said it was the voice of a haunted man?\r\n\r\n“Who that had seen him in his inner chamber, part library and part\r\nlaboratory,—for he was, as the world knew far and wide, a learned man\r\nin chemistry, and a teacher on whose lips and hands a crowd of aspiring\r\nears and eyes hung daily,—who that had seen him there, upon a winter\r\nnight, alone, surrounded by his drugs and instruments and books; the\r\nshadow of his shaded lamp, a monstrous beetle on the wall, motionless\r\namong a crowd of spectral shapes raised there by the flickering of the\r\nfire upon the quaint objects around him; some of these phantoms (the\r\nreflection of glass vessels that held liquids) trembling at heart like\r\nthings that knew his power to uncombine them, and to give back their\r\ncomponent parts to fire and vapour;—who that had seen him then, his\r\nwork done and he pondering in his chair before the rusted grate and red\r\nflame, moving his thin mouth as if in speech, but silent as the dead,\r\nwould not have said that the man seemed haunted and the chamber too?”\r\n\r\nIn the _Pickwick Papers_ the author describes in one of his happiest\r\nveins, the troubles of a chemist who is suddenly called to serve on a\r\ncommon jury—to try indeed the celebrated case of “Bardell _versus_\r\nPickwick”.\r\n\r\n“‘Answer to your names, gentlemen, that you may be sworn,’ said the\r\ngentleman in black.\r\n\r\n“‘Richard Upwitch.’\r\n\r\n“‘Here,’ said the greengrocer.\r\n\r\n“‘Thomas Groffin.’\r\n\r\n“‘Here,’ said the chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘Take the book, gentlemen. You shall well and truly try——’\r\n\r\n“‘I beg this court’s pardon,’ said the chemist, who was a tall, thin,\r\nyellow-visaged man, ‘but I hope this court will excuse my attendance.’\r\n\r\n“‘On what grounds, sir?’ said Mr. Justice Stareleigh.\r\n\r\n“‘I have no assistant, my lord,’ said the chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘Then you ought to be able to afford it, sir,’ said the judge\r\nreddening, for Mr. Justice Stareleigh’s temper bordered on the\r\nirritable, and brooked not contradiction.\r\n\r\n“‘I know I _ought_ to do, if I got on as well as I desired, but I\r\ndon’t, my lord,’ answered the chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘Swear the gentlemen,’ said the judge peremptorily.\r\n\r\n“The officer had got no further than the ‘You shall well and truly try’\r\nwhen he was again interrupted by the chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘I am to be sworn, my lord, am I?’ said the chemist.\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly, sir,’ replied the testy little judge.\r\n\r\n“‘Very well, my lord,’ replied the chemist in a resigned manner. ‘Then\r\nthere’ll be murder before this trial’s over: that’s all. Swear me if\r\nyou please, sir.’ And sworn the chemist was before the judge could find\r\nwords to utter.\r\n\r\n“‘I merely wanted to observe, my lord,’ said the chemist, taking his\r\nseat with great deliberation, ‘that I’ve left nobody but an errand boy\r\nin my shop. He is a very nice boy, my lord, but he is not acquainted\r\nwith drugs; and I know that the prevailing impression in his mind is,\r\nthat Epsom salts means oxalic acid, and syrup of senna, laudanum.\r\nThat’s all, my lord.’ With this, the tall chemist composed himself\r\ninto a comfortable attitude, and, assuming a pleasant expression of\r\ncountenance, appeared to have prepared himself for the worst.”\r\n\r\nThis little sketch shows the disabilities the chemist laboured under\r\nbefore he was exempted from jury service, and the intimate knowledge\r\nDickens had of almost every phase of life on which he wrote.\r\n\r\nIn _Oliver Twist_ he gives us an instance of prompt prescribing on the\r\npart of the parochial doctor’s assistant and dispenser, related by\r\nBumble.\r\n\r\nMr. Bumble betakes himself to the undertaker’s shop to arrange for the\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\n“‘Bayton,’ said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\r\nBumble; ‘I never heard the name before.’\r\n\r\n“Bumble shook his head as he replied, ‘Obstinate people, Mr.\r\nSowerberry—very obstinate. Proud, too, I’m afraid, sir.’\r\n\r\n“‘Proud, eh?’ exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. ‘Come, that’s too\r\nmuch.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, its sickening,’ replied the beadle; ‘antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!’\r\n\r\n“‘So it is,’ acquiesced the undertaker.\r\n\r\n“‘We only heard of the family the night before last,’ said the beadle;\r\n‘and we shouldn’t have known anything about them then, only a woman who\r\nlodges in the same house made an application to the parochial committee\r\nfor them to send the parochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad.\r\nHe had gone out to dinner, but his ’prentice (which is a very clever\r\nlad) sent ’em some medicine in a blacking bottle off hand.’\r\n\r\n“‘Ah, there’s promptness,’ said the undertaker.\r\n\r\n“‘Promptness indeed!’ replied the beadle. ‘But what’s the consequence;\r\nwhat’s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband\r\nsends back word that the medicine won’t suit his wife’s complaint, and\r\nso she shan’t take it—says she shan’t take it, sir! Good, strong,\r\nwholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish\r\nlabourers and a coal-heaver only a week before. Sent ’em for nothing,\r\nwith a blacking bottle in, and he sends back word that she shan’t take\r\nit, sir!’”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHACKERAY.\r\n\r\nThe great satirist, in _Pendennis_, gives us a brief sketch of the\r\napothecary of the Georgian era in the early life of John Pendennis,\r\nwho in the city of Bath practised as an apothecary and surgeon,\r\n“attending gentlemen in their sickrooms, and ladies at the most\r\ninteresting periods of their lives, and condescending to sell a\r\nbrown-paper plaister to a farmer’s wife across the counter, or to vend\r\ntooth-brushes, hair-powder, and London perfumery”. How he eventually\r\nmerged into John Pendennis, Esq., of Fairoaks, Clavering, with a\r\n“family pride,” is it not described with the pen of inimitable genius\r\nin the pages of the story?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMARRYAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his novel entitled _Japhet in Search of a Father_, Captain Marryat\r\nintroduces to us that eccentric apothecary, Mr. Phineas Cophagus; and\r\nalthough the character is doubtless exaggerated to some extent, it\r\nforms an amusing picture of the practising apothecary in the early part\r\nof this century.\r\n\r\nJaphet, who is taken in hand and apprenticed to the worthy\r\npractitioner, describes the shop looking upon Smithfield Market,\r\nwith its usual allowance of green, yellow, and blue bottles. All the\r\npatent medicines in the known world were kept in stock, even to the\r\nall-sufficient medicine for mankind of Mr. Euony. The shop was large,\r\nand at the back part there was a most capacious iron mortar with a\r\npestle to correspond.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor himself, we are told, might have been forty-five years\r\nof age. “He was of middle height, his face was thin, his nose very much\r\nhooked, his eyes small and piercing, with a good-humoured twinkle in\r\nthem. His mouth was large and drawn down at one corner. He was stout\r\nin his body, and carried a considerable protuberance before him, which\r\nhe was in the habit of patting with his left hand complacently. But\r\nalthough stout in his body, his legs were mere spindles, so that in his\r\nappearance he reminded you of some bird of the crane genus.\r\n\r\n“He dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, white cravat, and high\r\ncollar to his shirt; blue cotton-net pantaloons and Hessian boots, both\r\nfitting so tight that it appeared as if he was proud of his spindle\r\nshanks. His hat was broad-brimmed and low, and he carried a stout black\r\ncane with a gold top in his right hand, almost always raising the gold\r\ntop to his nose when he spoke.\r\n\r\n“The apothecary’s assistant, Brookes, was a tall, fresh-coloured, but\r\nhectic-looking young man, and, with the ubiquitous Timothy, who took\r\nout the medicine, formed the staff of the establishment.”\r\n\r\nJaphet’s introduction to the rudiments of the profession was to pound\r\nup some drugs in the big iron mortar, which he did with a will until\r\nthe perspiration ran down him in streams. He hadn’t been many months\r\nin the shop before he was left in charge with Timothy, who, after\r\ncudgelling his brains as to how they shall make a little money on their\r\nown account, agrees with Japhet to physic any one who comes in the shop.\r\n\r\nThe story is related by Japhet as follows:—\r\n\r\n“An old woman soon came in, and addressing Timothy, said that she\r\n‘wanted something for her poor grandchild’s sore throat’.\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t mix up the medicines, ma’am,’ replied Timothy; ‘you must\r\napply to that gentleman, Mr. Newland, who is behind the counter; he\r\nunderstands what is good for everybody’s complaints.’\r\n\r\n“‘Bless his handsome face—and so young, too! Why, be you a doctor,\r\nsir?’\r\n\r\n“‘I should hope so,’ replied I. ‘What is it you require—a lotion or an\r\nembrocation?’\r\n\r\n“‘I don’t understand those hard words, but I want some doctor’s stuff.’\r\n\r\n“‘Very well, my good woman; I know what is proper,’ replied I, assuming\r\nan important air. ‘Here, Timothy, wash out this phial very clean.’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, sir,’ replied Timothy very respectfully.\r\n\r\n“I took one of the measures, and putting in a little green, a little\r\nblue, and a little white liquid from the medicine bottles generally\r\nused by Mr. Brookes, filled it up with water, poured the mixture into\r\nthe phial, corked, and labelled it _haustus statim sumendus_, and\r\nhanded it over to the old woman.\r\n\r\n“‘Is the poor child to take it, or is it to rub outside?’ inquired the\r\nold woman.\r\n\r\n“‘The directions are on the label; but you don’t read Latin?’\r\n\r\n“‘Deary me, no! Latin! and do you understand Latin? What a nice clever\r\nboy!’\r\n\r\n“‘I should not be a good doctor if I did not,’ replied I. On second\r\nthoughts I considered it advisable and safer that the application\r\nshould be _external_, so I translated the label to her: _haustus_, rub\r\nit in; _statim_, on the throat; _sumendus_, with the palm of the hand.”\r\n\r\nTheir next effort at doctoring is humorously described by the novelist\r\nin the following words:—\r\n\r\n“An Irish labourer, more than half-tipsy, came in one evening and asked\r\nwhether we had such a thing as was called ‘_A poor man’s plaister_’.\r\n‘By the powers, it will be a poor man’s plaister when it belongs to me;\r\nbut they tell me that it is a sure and sartain cure for the thumbago,\r\nas they call it, which I’ve at the small of my back, and which is a\r\nhinder to my mounting up the ladder; so as it’s Saturday night, and\r\nI’ve just got the money, I’ll buy the plaister first, and then try\r\nwhat a little whisky inside will do. The devil is in’t if it won’t be\r\ndriven out of me between the two.’\r\n\r\n“We had not that plaister in the shop, but we had blister plaisters,\r\nand Timothy, handing one to me, I proffered it to him. ‘And what may\r\nyou be after asking for the same?’ inquired he.\r\n\r\n“The blisters were sold at a shilling each, when spread on paper, so I\r\nasked him eighteen-pence, that we might pocket the extra sixpence.\r\n\r\n“‘By the powers, one would think that you had made a mistake, and\r\nhanded me the rich man’s plaister instead of the poor one’s. It’s less\r\nwhisky I’ll have to drink, any how; but here’s the money, and the top\r\nof the morning to ye, seeing as how it’s jist getting late.’\r\n\r\n“Timothy and I laughed as we divided the sixpence. It appeared that\r\nafter taking his allowance of whisky the poor fellow fixed the plaister\r\non his back when he went to bed, and the next morning found himself in\r\na condition not to be envied. It was a week before we saw him again,\r\nand, much to the horror of Timothy and myself, he walked into the shop\r\nwhen Mr. Brookes was employed behind the counter. Timothy perceived him\r\nbefore he saw us, and pulling me behind the large mortar, we contrived\r\nto make our escape into the back parlour, the door of which we held\r\najar to hear what would take place.\r\n\r\n“‘Murder and turf!’ cried the man, ‘but that was the devil’s own\r\nplaister you gave me here for my back, and it left me as raw as a\r\nturnip, taking every bit of my skin off me entirely, forbye my lying in\r\nbed for a whole week and losing my day’s work.’\r\n\r\n“‘I really do not recollect supplying you with a plaister, my good\r\nman,’ replied Mr. Brookes.\r\n\r\n“‘Then by the piper that played before Moses, if you don’t recollect\r\nit, I’ve an idea that I shall never forget it. Sure enough, it cured\r\nme, but wasn’t I quite kilt before I was cured?’\r\n\r\n“‘It must have been some other shop,’ observed Mr. Brookes. ‘You have\r\nmade a mistake.’\r\n\r\n“‘Devil a bit of a mistake, except in selling me the plaister. Didn’t I\r\nget it of a lad in this same shop?’\r\n\r\n“‘Nobody sells things out of this shop without my knowledge.’\r\n\r\n“The Irishman was puzzled—he looked round the shop. ‘Well, then, if\r\nthis a’n’t the shop, it was own sister to it.’”\r\n\r\n“Like all embryo apothecaries,” says Japhet, “I carried in my\r\nappearance, if not the look of wisdom, most certainly that of\r\nself-sufficiency, which does equally well with the world in general.\r\nMy forehead was smooth and very white, and my dark locks were combed\r\nback systematically and with a regularity that said, as plainly as\r\nhair could do, ‘The owner of this does everything by prescription,\r\nmeasurement, and rule’. Altogether I cut such a truly medical\r\nappearance that even the most guarded would not have hesitated to allow\r\nme the sole conduct of a whitlow, from inflammation to suppuration, and\r\nfrom suppuration to cure, or have refused to have confided to me the\r\nentire suppression of a gumboil.\r\n\r\n“Such were my personal qualifications at the time I was raised to the\r\nimportant office of dispenser of, I may say, life and death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note\r\n\r\n\r\nText in italics was surrounded with _underscores_ and small capitals\r\nchanged to all capitals.\r\n\r\nA few errors in punctuation were corrected silently. Also the\r\nfollowing changes were made, on page\r\n\r\n   52 “furnance” changed to “furnace” (seizing his red-hot tongs from\r\n      the little furnace in which)\r\n\r\n   76 “Teragrammaton” changed to “Tetragrammaton” (Tetragrammaton +\r\n      Adonai)\r\n\r\n  234 “the” added (centre of the cover)\r\n\r\n  273 “Lanfen” changed to “Lafeu” (Lafeu. Go to, sir, you were beaten\r\n      in Italy)\r\n\r\n  278 “Spencer” changed to “Spenser” (Edmund Spenser was born in\r\n      London).\r\n\r\nOtherwise the original was preserved, including unusual or\r\ninconsistent spelling and hyphenation, and possible errors in\r\nquotes from other books.",
